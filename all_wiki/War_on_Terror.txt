The '''War on terror''', also known as the '''Global War on Terrorism''' and '''U.S. War on Terror''', is an international military campaign launched by the [[Federal government of the United States|United States government]] after the [[September 11 attacks]].<ref name="Schmitt/slogan">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/26/politics/26strategy.html?_r=0 |title=U.S. Officials Retool Slogan for Terror War|newspaper=New York Times|date=26 July 2005|author=Eric Schmitt|author2=Thom Shanker}}</ref> The targets of the campaign are primarily [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] [[Islamism|Islamic]] [[Islamic fundamentalism|fundamentalist]] armed groups located throughout the [[Muslim world]], with the most prominent groups being [[Al-Qaeda]], the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|Islamic State]], the [[Taliban]], [[Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan]], and the various franchise groups of the former two organizations.

According to a 2020 study conducted under the auspices of the [[Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs]], the several wars initiated by the United States in its war against terror have caused the displacement, conservatively calculated, of 37 million people.<ref name="Vine" >David Vine, Cala Coffman, Katalina Khoury, Madison Lovasz, Helen Bush, Rachel Leduc, Jennifer Walkup, [https://watson.brown.edu/costsofwar/files/cow/imce/papers/2020/Displacement_Vine%20et%20al_Costs%20of%20War%202020%2009%2008.pdf 'Creating Refugees:Displacement Caused by the United States’ Post-9/11 Wars,']  [[Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs]]  8 September 2020.</ref><ref>David Vine, [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/sep/18/us-wars-iraq-george-w-bush 'US-led wars have displaced 37m people.

[[Criticism of the war on terror]] focused on its morality, efficiency, and cost; some, including later president [[Barack Obama]],<ref>[http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2009/aug/06/white-house-war-terrorism-over/ White House: ‘War on terrorism’ is over] 6 August 2009.</ref><ref name="declover" /><ref name="whitehdefuniv" /><ref name="terrorover" /> objected to the phrase itself as a [[misnomer]]. The notion of a "war" against "terrorism" has proven contentious, with critics charging that it has been exploited by participating governments to pursue long-standing policy/military objectives,<ref name="Monbiot2003" /> reduce [[civil liberties]],<ref name="Wired-FBI" /> and infringe upon human rights. Critics also assert that the term "war" is not appropriate in this context (much like the term "[[War on Drugs]]") since terror is not an identifiable enemy and it is unlikely that international terrorism can be brought to an end by military means.<ref name="Richissin" />

=={{anchor|Terminology}}Etymology==
The phrase ''war on terror'' has been used to specifically refer to the ongoing military campaign led by the U.S., U.K. and their allies against organizations and regimes identified by them as terrorist, and usually excludes other independent [[counter-terrorism|counter-terrorist operations and campaigns]] such as those by Russia and India. The conflict has also been referred to by names other than the War on Terror. It has also been known as:

===History of use of the phrase and its rejection by the U.S. government===
In 1984, the [[Presidency of Ronald Reagan|Reagan administration]], which had significantly expanded the CIA-run [[Operation Cyclone|program of funding]] the mujaheddin militants in Afghanistan, employed the term "war against terrorism" to pass legislation aimed at countering terrorist groups in the wake of the [[1983 Beirut barracks bombing]] that killed 241 U.S. and 58 French [[peacekeeping|peacekeepers]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Silver |first=Alexandra |url=http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1973131,00.html |title=How America Became a Surveillance State |work=Time |date=18 March 2010 |access-date=26 March 2011}}</ref> In 2017, [[U.S. Vice President]] [[Mike Pence]] called the 1983 Beirut barracks bombing "the opening salvo in a war that we have waged ever since—the global war on terror."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newsweek.com/trump-administration-says-war-terror-began-911-hezbollah-attack-us-troops-691653|title=Mike Pence says Hezbollah started the war on terror with a 1983 attack in Beirut|date=24 October 2017|work=Newsweek}}</ref>

The concept of the U.S. at war with terrorism may have begun on 11 September 2001 when [[Tom Brokaw]], having just witnessed the collapse of one of the towers of the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]], declared "Terrorists have declared war on [America]."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://archives.nbclearn.com/portal/site/k-12/flatview?cuecard=1419 |title=Breaking News on September 11th |author=Matt Lauer |author2=Katie Couric |author3=Tom Brokaw |date=11 September 2001 |website=NBC Learn K-12 |publisher=NBCUniversal Media |access-date=11 September 2012|author2-link=Katie Couric |author-link=Matt Lauer}}</ref>

On 16 September 2001, at [[Camp David]], U.S. president George W. Bush used the phrase ''war on terrorism'' in an ostensibly unscripted comment when answering a journalist's question about the impact of enhanced law enforcement authority given to the [[Mass surveillance in the United States|U.S. surveillance]] agencies on Americans' civil liberties: "This is a new kind of—a new kind of evil.

In May 2013, two years after the [[Death of Osama bin Laden|assassination]] of [[Osama bin Laden]], Barack Obama delivered a speech that employed the term ''global war on terror'' put in quotation marks (as officially transcribed by the White House): "Now, make no mistake, our nation is still threatened by terrorists. ... But we have to recognize that the threat has shifted and evolved from the one that came to our shores on 9/11. ... From our use of drones to the detention of terrorist suspects, the decisions that we are making now will define the type of nation—and world—that we leave to our children. So America is at a crossroads. We must define the nature and scope of this struggle, or else it will define us. We have to be mindful of James Madison's warning that "No nation could preserve its freedom in the midst of continual warfare." ... In Afghanistan, we will complete our transition to Afghan responsibility for that country's security. ... Beyond Afghanistan, we must define our effort not as a boundless "global war on terror," but rather as a series of persistent, targeted efforts to dismantle specific networks of violent extremists that threaten America. In many cases, this will involve partnerships with other countries." Nevertheless, in the same speech, in a bid to emphasize the legality of military actions undertaken by the U.S., noting that [[Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists|Congress had authorised]] the use of force, he went on to say, "Under domestic law, and international law, the United States is at war with al Qaeda, the Taliban, and their associated forces.  We are at war with an organization that right now would kill as many Americans as they could if we did not stop them first. So this is a just war—a war waged proportionally, in last resort, and in self-defense."<ref name=whitehdefuniv>[https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2013/05/23/remarks-president-national-defense-university Remarks by the President at the National Defense University] The White House, 23 May 2013.</ref><ref name=terrorover>{{cite news |title=Obama: 'Global War on Terror' Is Over |author=Paul D.

===The rhetorical war on terror===
Because the actions involved in the war on terrorism are diffuse, and the criteria for inclusion are unclear, political theorist Richard Jackson has argued that "the 'war on terrorism,' therefore, is simultaneously a set of actual practices—wars, covert operations, agencies, and institutions—and an accompanying series of assumptions, beliefs, justifications, and narratives—it is an entire language or discourse."<ref>Jackson, ''Writing the War on Terrorism'' (2005), p. 8.</ref> Jackson cites among many examples a statement by [[John Ashcroft]] that "the attacks of September 11 drew a bright line of demarcation between the civil and the savage".<ref>Jackson, ''Writing the War on Terrorism'' (2005), p. 62.</ref> Administration officials also described "terrorists" as hateful, treacherous, barbarous, mad, twisted, perverted, without faith, [[Parasitism|parasitical]], inhuman, and, most commonly, evil.<ref>Jackson, ''Writing the War on Terrorism'' (2005), pp. 62–75.</ref> Americans, in contrast, were described as brave, loving, generous, strong, resourceful, heroic, and respectful of human rights.<ref>Jackson, ''Writing the War on Terrorism'' (2005), pp. 77–80.</ref>

Both the term and the policies it denotes have been a source of ongoing controversy, as critics argue it has been used to justify unilateral [[preventive war]], human rights abuses and other violations of international law.<ref>Borhan Uddin Khan and Muhammad Mahbubur Rahman, "Combating Terrorism under Human Rights and Humanitarian Law Regime", ''Mediterranean Journal of Human Rights'', Vol. 12 (double issue), 2008, pp.379–397.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amnestyusa.org/our-work/issues/security-and-human-rights?id=1108209|title= Civil Rights and the "War on Terror"|publisher=Amnesty International USA|access-date=2 May 2010}}</ref>

==Background==

===Precursor to the September 11 attacks===
{{See also|Islamic terrorism|List of Islamist terrorist attacks}}
The origins of al-Qaeda can be traced back to the [[Soviet–Afghan War]] (December 1979 – February 1989). The United States, the United Kingdom, Saudi Arabia, [[Pakistan]], and the People's Republic of China supported the Afghan [[mujahideen]] [[guerilla warfare|guerillas]] against the military forces of the Soviet Union and the [[Democratic Republic of Afghanistan]]. A small number of "Afghan Arab" volunteers joined the fight against the Soviets, including [[Osama bin Laden]], but there is no evidence they received any external assistance.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bergen|first=Peter|title=The Osama Bin Laden I Know: An Oral History of Al-Qaeda's Leader|publisher=Free Press|year=2006|pages=60–61}}</ref> In a 1993 interview, bin Laden himself said that, “Personally neither I nor my brothers saw evidence of American help."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.factcheck.org/2013/02/rand-pauls-bin-laden-claim-is-urban-myth/|title=Rand Paul's Bin Laden Claim Is 'Urban Myth'|website=FactCheck}}</ref> In May 1996 the group World Islamic Front for Jihad Against Jews and Crusaders (WIFJAJC), sponsored by bin Laden (and later re-formed as al-Qaeda), started forming a large base of operations in [[Afghanistan]], where the Islamist extremist regime of the [[Taliban]] had seized power earlier in the year.<ref>The group was also responsible for the [[1993 World Trade Center bombing]].{{cite news|url=https://articles.latimes.com/2001/dec/06/news/mn-12224|title=Fighters Hunt Former Ally|date=6 December 2001|author=Megan K.

On the morning of 11 September 2001, [[Hijackers in the September 11 attacks|nineteen men]] [[Aircraft hijacking|hijacked]] four [[jet airliner]]s, all of them bound for California. Once the hijackers assumed control of the jet airliners, they told the passengers that they had a [[Explosive device|bomb]] on board and would spare the lives of passengers and crew once their demands were met – no passenger and crew actually suspected that they would use the jet airliners as [[suicide weapon]]s since it had never happened before in history, and many previous hijacking attempts had been resolved with the passengers and crew escaping unharmed after obeying the hijackers.<ref name="Holmes">{{cite book |last=Holmes|first=Stephen|title=Making sense of suicide missions|year=2006|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-929797-9|editor=Diego Gambetta|chapter=Al Qaeda, 11 September 2001}}</ref><ref name="Keppel2008">{{cite book|last1=Keppel|first1=Gilles|title=Al Qaeda in its own words|year=2008|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-02804-3|last2=Milelli|first2=Jean-Pierre|last3=Ghazaleh|first3=Pascale|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780674028043}}</ref> The hijackers – members of al-Qaeda's [[Hamburg cell]]<ref>"[http://www.9-11commission.gov/report/911Report_Ch5.htm Chapter of the 9/11 Commission Report detailing the history of the Hamburg Cell]".

The [[Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists]] or "AUMF" was made law on 14 September 2001, to authorize the use of United States Armed Forces against those responsible for the September 11 attacks. It authorized the President to use all necessary and appropriate force against those nations, organizations, or persons he determines planned, authorized, committed, or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on 11 September 2001, or harbored such organizations or persons, to prevent any future acts of international terrorism against the United States by such nations, organizations or individuals. Congress declares this is intended to constitute specific statutory authorization within the meaning of section 5(b) of the [[War Powers Resolution]] of 1973.

On 20 September 2001, in the wake of the [[September 11 attacks]], George W. Bush delivered an ultimatum to the Taliban government of Afghanistan, the [[Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan]], to turn over Osama bin Laden and [[al-Qaeda]] leaders operating in the country or face attack.<ref name="cnntranscript" /> The Taliban demanded evidence of bin Laden's link to the September 11 attacks and, if such evidence warranted a trial, they offered to handle such a trial in an Islamic Court.<ref>{{cite news|title=Taliban rejects president Bush's demands |publisher=PBS |date=21 September 2001 |url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/updates/september01/taliban_9-21.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080601224636/https://www.pbs.org/newshour/updates/september01/taliban_9-21.html |archive-date=1 June 2008}}</ref> The U.S. refused to provide any evidence.

The NATO-led [[International Security Assistance Force]] (ISAF) was created in December 2001 to assist the [[Afghan Transitional Administration]] and the first post-Taliban elected government. With a renewed Taliban insurgency, it was announced in 2006 that ISAF would replace the U.S. troops in the province as part of Operation Enduring Freedom.

The British [[16th Air Assault Brigade]] (later reinforced by [[Royal Marines]]) formed the core of the force in southern Afghanistan, along with troops and helicopters from Australia, Canada and the Netherlands. The initial force consisted of roughly 3,300 British, 2,000 Canadian, 1,400 from the Netherlands and 240 from Australia, along with special forces from Denmark and [[Estonia]] and small contingents from other nations.

[[Iraq]] had been listed as a [[State sponsor of terrorism]] by the U.S. since 1990,<ref>{{cite news|title=Iraq accuses U.S., Turkey of 'illegally' meeting with Kurds |publisher=CNN |date=9 March 2000 |url=http://archives.cnn.com/2000/WORLD/meast/03/09/un.iraq/index.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516120925/http://archives.cnn.com/2000/WORLD/meast/03/09/un.iraq/index.html |archive-date=16 May 2008}}</ref> when [[Saddam Hussein]] [[invasion of Kuwait|invaded Kuwait]]. Iraq had also been on the list from 1979 to 1982; it was removed so that the U.S. could provide material support to Iraq in its [[Iran–Iraq War|war with Iran]]. Hussein's regime had proven to be a problem for the UN and Iraq's neighbors due to its use of [[chemical weapons]] against [[Iranian people|Iranians]] and [[Kurds]] in the 1980s.

===Iraqi no-fly zones===
Following the ceasefire agreement that suspended hostilities (but not officially ended) in the 1991 [[Gulf War]], the United States and its allies instituted and began patrolling [[Iraqi no-fly zones]], to protect Iraq's [[Kurds|Kurdish]] and [[Shi'a]] [[Arab]] population—both of which suffered attacks from the Hussein regime before and after the Gulf War—in Iraq's northern and southern regions, respectively. U.S. forces continued in combat zone deployments through November 1995 and launched [[Operation Desert Fox]] against Iraq in 1998 after it failed to meet U.S. demands for "unconditional cooperation" in weapons inspections.<ref>{{cite news|title=Clinton: Iraq has abused its final chance |publisher=CNN |date=16 December 1998 |url=http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/stories/1998/12/16/clinton/index.html?eref=sitesearch}}</ref>

In the aftermath of Operation Desert Fox, during December 1998, Iraq announced that it would no longer respect the no-fly zones and resumed its attempts to shoot down U.S. aircraft.

The Iraq War began in March 2003 with an air campaign, which was immediately followed by a [[2003 invasion of Iraq|U.S.-led ground invasion]]. The Bush administration cited UNSC Resolution 1441, which warned of "serious consequences" for violations such as [[Iraq and weapons of mass destruction|Iraq possessing weapons of mass destruction]].

In January 2007, President Bush presented a new strategy for Operation Iraqi Freedom based upon [[counter-insurgency]] theories and tactics developed by General [[David Petraeus]]. The [[Iraq War troop surge of 2007]] was part of this "new way forward", which along with U.S. backing of [[Sunni]] groups it had previously sought to defeat has been credited with a widely recognized dramatic decrease in violence by up to 80%.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}

Following the September 11 attacks, former President of Pakistan [[Pervez Musharraf]] sided with the U.S. against the Taliban government in Afghanistan after an ultimatum by then U.S. President George W. Bush. Musharraf agreed to give the U.S. the use of three airbases for Operation Enduring Freedom. [[United States Secretary of State]] [[Colin Powell]] and other U.S. administration officials met with Musharraf. On 19 September 2001, Musharraf addressed the people of Pakistan and stated that, while he opposed military tactics against the Taliban, Pakistan risked being endangered by an alliance of India and the U.S. if it did not cooperate. In 2006, Musharraf testified that this stance was pressured by threats from the U.S., and revealed in his memoirs that he had "war-gamed" the United States as an adversary and decided that it would end in a loss for Pakistan.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2006-09-25-pakistan-memoir_x.htm|title= Musharraf's book says Pakistan faced U.S. 'onslaught' if it didn't back terror war|access-date=14 September 2014|work=USA Today|date=26 September 2006}}</ref>

On 12 January 2002, Musharraf gave a speech against Islamic extremism. He unequivocally condemned all acts of terrorism and pledged to combat Islamic extremism and lawlessness within Pakistan itself. He stated that his government was committed to rooting out extremism and made it clear that the banned militant organizations would not be allowed to resurface under any new name. He said, "the recent decision to ban extremist groups promoting militancy was taken in the national interest after thorough consultations. It was not taken under any foreign influence".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archives.dawn.com/dawnftp/72.249.57.55/dawnftp/fixed/arch/arch_2003.html |title=Musharraf vows to root out extremism: Banned outfits won't be allowed to resurface |publisher=Dawn.Com |date=5 December 2003 |first=Rafaqat |last=Ali |access-date=26 March 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110317081424/http://archives.dawn.com/dawnftp/72.249.57.55/dawnftp/fixed/arch/arch_2003.html |archive-date=17 March 2011}}</ref>

In 2004, the [[Pakistan Army]] launched a campaign in the [[Federally Administered Tribal Areas]] of Pakistan's [[Waziristan]] region, sending in 80,000 troops. The goal of the conflict was to remove the al-Qaeda and Taliban forces in the area.

After the fall of the Taliban regime, many members of the Taliban resistance fled to the Northern border region of Afghanistan and Pakistan where the Pakistani army had previously little control. With the logistics and air support of the United States, the Pakistani Army captured or killed numerous al-Qaeda operatives such as Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, wanted for his involvement in the USS ''Cole'' bombing, the [[Bojinka plot]], and the killing of ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' reporter [[Daniel Pearl]].

The United States has carried out a campaign of [[Drone attacks in Pakistan|drone attacks]] on targets all over the Federally Administered Tribal Areas. However, the [[Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan|Pakistani Taliban]] still operates there.

The use of drones by the Central Intelligence Agency in Pakistan to carry out operations associated with the Global War on Terror sparks debate over sovereignty and the laws of war. The U.S. Government uses the CIA rather than the [[U.S. Air Force]] for strikes in Pakistan to avoid breaching sovereignty through military invasion. The United States was criticized by{{according to whom|date=May 2015}} a report on drone warfare and [[Airspace|aerial sovereignty]] for abusing the term 'Global War on Terror' to carry out military operations through government agencies without formally declaring war.

In the three years before the September 11 attacks, Pakistan received approximately {{nowrap|US$9 million}} in American military aid. In the three years after, the number increased to {{nowrap|US$4.2 billion}}, making it the country with the maximum funding post 9/11.

Operation Enduring Freedom – Trans Sahara (OEF-TS) is the name of the military operation conducted by the U.S. and partner nations in the Sahara/Sahel region of Africa, consisting of counter-terrorism efforts and policing of arms and drug trafficking across central Africa.

The [[Northern Mali conflict (2012–present)|conflict in northern Mali]] began in January 2012 with radical Islamists (affiliated to al-Qaeda) advancing into northern Mali. The Malian government had a hard time maintaining full control over their country. The fledgling government requested support from the international community on combating the Islamic militants. In January 2013, France intervened on behalf of the Malian government's request and deployed troops into the region. They launched [[Operation Serval]] on 11 January 2013, with the hopes of dislodging the al-Qaeda affiliated groups from northern Mali.<ref>{{cite news|title=Mali conflict: militants killed as French air strikes pound rebel camps |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jan/13/mali-crisis-militants-killed-french-jets|newspaper=The Guardian|date=14 January 2013|location=London|first=Nick|last=Hopkins}}</ref>

The primary goal of the coalition forces is to monitor, inspect, board and stop suspected shipments from entering the Horn of Africa region and affecting the United States' [[Operation Iraqi Freedom]].

Included in the operation is the training of selected armed forces units of the countries of Djibouti, [[Kenya]] and [[Ethiopia]] in counter-terrorism and [[counter-insurgency]] tactics. Humanitarian efforts conducted by CJTF-HOA include rebuilding of schools and medical clinics and providing medical services to those countries whose forces are being trained.

The program expands as part of the [[Trans-Saharan Counterterrorism Initiative]] as CJTF personnel also assist in training the armed forces of [[Chad]], Niger, [[Mauritania]] and [[Mali]]. However, the War on Terror does not include Sudan, where over 400,000 have died in an ongoing civil war.

On 1 July 2006, a Web-posted message purportedly written by Osama bin Laden urged [[Somalis]] to build an [[Islamic state]] in the country and warned western governments that the al-Qaeda network would fight against them if they intervened there.<ref name="BIN-LADEN-MESSAGE-IRAQ-SOMALIA">{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2006-07-01-bin-laden-plans-message_x.htm |title=Bin Laden releases Web message on Iraq, Somalia |work=USA Today |date=1 July 2006 |access-date=2 January 2012}}</ref>

Somalia has been considered a "[[failed state]]" because its official central government was weak, dominated by warlords and unable to exert effective control over the country. Beginning in mid-2006, the Islamic Courts Union (ICU), an Islamist faction campaigning on a restoration of "law and order" through [[Sharia]] law, had rapidly taken control of much of southern Somalia.

On 14 December 2006, the U.S. Assistant Secretary of State [[Jendayi Frazer]] claimed al-Qaeda cell operatives were controlling the Islamic Courts Union, a claim denied by the ICU.<ref name="US-SAYS-AL-QAEDA-BEHIND-SOMALI-ISLAMISTS">{{cite web|url=http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/L14556061.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080204082431/http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/L14556061.htm |archive-date=4 February 2008 |title=U.S. says al Qaeda behind Somali Islamists |date=4 February 2008 |access-date=2 January 2012}}</ref>

By late 2006, the UN-backed [[Transitional Federal Government]] (TFG) of Somalia had seen its power effectively limited to [[Baidoa]], while the Islamic Courts Union controlled the majority of southern Somalia, including the capital of [[Mogadishu]]. On 20 December 2006, the Islamic Courts Union launched an [[Battle of Baidoa|offensive]] on the government stronghold of Baidoa and saw early gains before Ethiopia intervened for the government.

By 26 December, the Islamic Courts Union retreated towards Mogadishu, before again retreating as TFG/Ethiopian troops neared, leaving them to take Mogadishu with [[Fall of Mogadishu|no resistance]]. The ICU then fled to [[Kismayo]], where they fought Ethiopian/TFG forces in the [[Battle of Jilib]].

The Prime Minister of Somalia claimed that three "terror suspects" from the [[1998 United States embassy bombings]] are being sheltered in Kismayo.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/jun/13/usa.terrorism |work=The Guardian |location=London |title=Secret world of US jails |first=Jason |last=Burke |date=13 June 2004 |access-date=9 April 2010}}</ref> On 30 December 2006, al-Qaeda deputy leader [[Ayman al-Zawahiri]] called upon Muslims worldwide to fight against Ethiopia and the TFG in Somalia.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/cfr/world/slot2_20090227.html?_r=1|title=Backgrounder: Al-Shabaab |work=The New York Times|author=Stephanie Hanson|date=2 March 2009|access-date=4 May 2010}}</ref>

''NBC News'' reported that in mid-2014, [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant in Libya|ISIS had about 1,000 fighters in Libya]]. Taking advantage of a power vacuum in the center of the country, far from the major cities of Tripoli and Benghazi, ISIS expanded rapidly over the next 18 months. Local militants were joined by jihadists from the rest of North Africa, the Middle East, Europe and the Caucasus. The force absorbed or defeated other Islamist groups inside Libya and the central ISIS leadership in Raqqa, Syria, began urging foreign recruits to head for Libya instead of Syria. ISIS seized control of the coastal city of [[Sirte]] in early 2015 and then began to expand to the east and south. By the beginning of 2016, it had effective control of 120 to 150 miles of coastline and portions of the interior and had reached Eastern Libya's major population center, [[Benghazi]]. In spring 2016, [[United States Africa Command|AFRICOM]] estimated that ISIS had about 5,000 fighters in its stronghold of Sirte.<ref name="Did Obama Defeat ISIS in Libya">{{cite web|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/did-obama-defeat-isis-libya-n709001|title=Did Obama Defeat ISIS in Libya?|publisher=NBC news|date=28 January 2017}}</ref>

However, the indigenous rebel groups who had staked their claims to Libya and turned their weapons on ISIS—with the help of airstrikes by Western forces, including U.S. drones, the Libyan population resented the outsiders who wanted to establish a fundamentalist regime on their soil. Militias loyal to the new Libyan unity government, plus a separate and rival force loyal to a former officer in the Qaddafi regime, [[Battle of Sirte (2016)|launched an assault on ISIS outposts in Sirte]] and the surrounding areas that lasted for months. According to U.S. military estimates, ISIS ranks shrank to somewhere between a few hundred and 2,000 fighters. In August 2016, the [[Military intervention against ISIL#Intervention in Libya|U.S. military began airstrikes]] that, along with continued pressure on the ground from the Libyan militias, pushed the remaining ISIS fighters back into Sirte, In all, U.S. drones and planes hit ISIS nearly 590 times, the Libyan militias reclaimed the city in mid-December.<ref name="Did Obama Defeat ISIS in Libya" /> On 18 January 2017, ABC News reported that two USAF [[Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit|B-2 bombers]] struck two ISIS camps {{convert|28|mi}} south of Sirte, the airstrikes targeted between 80 and 100 ISIS fighters in multiple camps, an unmanned aircraft also participated in the airstrikes. ''NBC News'' reported that as many as 90 ISIS fighters were killed in the strike, a U.S. defense official said that "This was the largest remaining ISIS presence in Libya," and that "They have been largely marginalized, but I am hesitant to say they have been eliminated in Libya."<ref name="Did Obama Defeat ISIS in Libya" />

[[File:BritishPatrolHelmand01.jpg|thumb|The United Kingdom is the second largest contributor of troops in [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Afghanistan]]]]
The invasion of Afghanistan is seen to have been the first action of this war, and initially involved forces from the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Afghan [[Northern Alliance]]. Since the initial invasion period, these forces were augmented by troops and aircraft from Australia, Canada, Denmark, France, Italy, Netherlands, New Zealand and Norway amongst others. In 2006, there were about 33,000 troops in Afghanistan.

On 12 September 2001, less than 24 hours after the September 11 attacks in New York City and Washington, D.C., NATO invoked Article 5 of the [[North Atlantic Treaty]] and declared the attacks to be an attack against all 19 NATO member countries. Australian Prime Minister [[John Howard]] also stated that Australia would invoke the [[ANZUS]] Treaty along similar lines.<ref>{{cite news |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |date=14 September 2001 |access-date=19 January 2011 |url=http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/content/2001/s367069.htm |title=PM speaks on Ansett collapse, Anzus treaty}}</ref>

In the following months, NATO took a broad range of measures to respond to the threat of terrorism. On 22 November 2002, the member states of the [[Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council]] (EAPC) decided on a Partnership Action Plan against Terrorism, which explicitly states, "[The] EAPC States are committed to the protection and promotion of fundamental freedoms and human rights, as well as the rule of law, in combating terrorism."<ref>{{cite news |title=Partnership Action Plan against Terrorism |url=http://pfpdev.ethz.ch/SCORMcontent/72234/scos/93/documents/0.pdf |date=22 November 2002 |access-date=19 January 2011 |publisher=[[NATO]]}}{{Dead link|date=December 2011}}</ref> NATO started naval operations in the Mediterranean Sea designed to prevent the movement of terrorists or weapons of mass destruction as well as to enhance the security of shipping in general called Operation Active Endeavour.

Support for the U.S. cooled when America made clear its determination to invade Iraq in late 2002. Even so, many of the "coalition of the willing" countries that unconditionally supported the U.S.-led military action have sent troops to Afghanistan, particular neighboring Pakistan, which has disowned its earlier support for the Taliban and contributed tens of thousands of soldiers to the conflict. Pakistan was also engaged in the [[Insurgency in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]] (a.k.a. Waziristan War or North-West Pakistan War). Supported by U.S. intelligence, Pakistan was attempting to remove the Taliban insurgency and al-Qaeda element from the northern tribal areas.<ref>{{cite news|title=New frontline in the war on terror.}}</ref>

==Terrorist attacks and failed plots since 9/11==
===Al-Qaeda===
{{Main|al-Qaeda|Timeline of al-Qaeda attacks}}
Since 9/11, Al-Qaeda and other affiliated radical Islamist groups have executed attacks in several parts of the world where conflicts are not taking place. Whereas countries like Pakistan have suffered hundreds of attacks killing tens of thousands and displacing much more.
* The [[2002 Bali bombings]] in Indonesia were committed by various members of [[Jemaah Islamiyah]], an organization linked to Al-Qaeda.
* The [[2003 Casablanca bombings]] were carried out by [[Salafia Jihadia]], an Al-Qaeda affiliate.
* After the [[2003 Istanbul bombings]], Turkey charged 74 people with involvement, including Syrian Al-Qaeda member [[Loai al-Saqa]].
* The [[2004 Madrid train bombings]] in Spain were "inspired by" Al-Qaeda, though no direct involvement has been established.
* The [[7 July 2005 London bombings]] in the United Kingdom were perpetrated by four [[Homegrown terrorism|homegrown terrorists]], one of whom appeared in an edited video with a known Al-Qaeda operative, though the British government denies Al-Qaeda involvement.
* Al Qaeda claimed responsibility for the [[11 April 2007 Algiers bombings]] in Algeria.
* The [[2007 Glasgow International Airport attack]] in the United Kingdom was carried out by a pair of bombers whose laptops and suicide notes included videos and speeches referencing Al-Qaeda, though no direct involvement was established.
* The [[2009 Fort Hood shooting]] in the United States was committed by [[Nidal Malik Hasan]], who had been in communication with [[Anwar al-Awlaki]], though the Department of Defense classifies the shooting as an incidence of workplace violence.
* Morocco blames Al-Qaeda for the [[2011 Marrakech bombing]], though Al-Qaeda denies involvement.
* The 2012 [[Toulouse and Montauban shootings]] in France were committed by Mohammed Merah, who reportedly had familial ties to Al-Qaeda, along with a history of petty crime and psychological issues. Merah claimed ties to Al-Qaeda, though French authorities deny any connection.
* To date, no one has been convicted for the 2012 [[U.S. Consulate attack in Benghazi]] in Libya, and no one has claimed responsibility. Branches of Al-Qaeda, Al-Qaeda affiliates, and individuals "sympathetic to Al-Qaeda" are blamed.

There may also have been several additional planned attacks that were not successful.
* [[2004 financial buildings plot]] (The United States and the United Kingdom)
* [[21 July 2005 London bombings]] (United Kingdom)
* [[2006 Toronto terrorism plot]] (Canada)
* [[2006 transatlantic aircraft plot]] involving liquid explosives carried onto commercial airplanes
* 2006 [[Hudson River bomb plot]] (United States)
* [[2007 Fort Dix attack plot]] (United States)
* [[2007 London car bombs]] (United Kingdom)
* [[2007 John F. Kennedy International Airport attack plot]] (United States)
* [[2009 Bronx terrorism plot]] (United States)
* [[2009 New York City Subway and United Kingdom plot]] (The United States and the United Kingdom)
* 2009 [[Northwest Airlines Flight 253]] bombing plot (United States)
* [[2010 Stockholm bombings]] (Sweden)
* [[2010 Times Square car bombing attempt]] (United States)
* [[2010 cargo plane bomb plot]] (United States)
* [[2010 Portland car bomb plot]] (United States)
* [[2011 Manhattan terrorism plot]] (United States)
* [[2013 VIA Rail Canada terrorism plot]] (Canada)

[[File:Liberty.jpg|thumb|upright|A [[U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement]] helicopter patrols the airspace over New York City]]
In addition to military efforts abroad, in the aftermath of 9/11, the Bush Administration increased domestic efforts to prevent future attacks. Various government bureaucracies that handled security and military functions were reorganized. A new cabinet-level agency called the [[United States Department of Homeland Security]] was created in November 2002 to lead and coordinate the largest reorganization of the U.S. federal government since the consolidation of the armed forces into the Department of Defense.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

The Justice Department launched the [[National Security Entry-Exit Registration System]] for certain male non-citizens in the U.S., requiring them to register in person at offices of the [[Immigration and Naturalization Service]].

The USA PATRIOT Act of October 2001 dramatically reduces restrictions on law enforcement agencies' ability to search telephone, e-mail communications, medical, financial, and other records; eases restrictions on foreign intelligence gathering within the United States; expands the [[Secretary of the Treasury]]'s authority to regulate financial transactions, particularly those involving foreign individuals and entities; and broadens the discretion of law enforcement and immigration authorities in detaining and deporting immigrants suspected of terrorism-related acts. The act also expanded the definition of terrorism to include domestic terrorism, thus enlarging the number of activities to which the USA PATRIOT Act's expanded law enforcement powers could be applied. A new [[Terrorist Finance Tracking Program]] monitored the movements of terrorists' financial resources (discontinued after being revealed by ''[[The New York Times]]''). Global telecommunication usage, including those with no links to terrorism,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/oct/10/double-danger-nsa-surveillance |title=The double danger of the NSA's 'collect it all' policy on surveillance |author=Rachel Levinson-Waldman |work=The Guardian |access-date=27 February 2014}}</ref> is being collected and monitored through the [[NSA electronic surveillance program]]. The Patriot Act is still in effect.

Political interest groups have stated that these laws remove important restrictions on governmental authority, and are a dangerous encroachment on civil liberties, possible [[Constitutionality|unconstitutional]] violations of the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]]. On 30 July 2003, the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU) filed the first legal challenge against Section 215 of the Patriot Act, claiming that it allows the [[FBI]] to violate a citizen's [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] rights, Fourth Amendment rights, and right to [[due process]], by granting the government the right to search a person's business, bookstore, and library records in a terrorist investigation, without disclosing to the individual that records were being searched.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ala.org/ala/alonline/currentnews/newsarchive/2003/august2003/firstpatriot.cfm |title=American Libraries – First Patriot Act Challenge Filed by ACLU |publisher=ALA |date=4 August 2003 |access-date=26 March 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120122043434/http://www.ala.org/ala/alonline/currentnews/newsarchive/2003/august2003/firstpatriot.cfm |archive-date=22 January 2012}}</ref> Also, governing bodies in many communities have passed symbolic resolutions against the act.
[[File:John Walker Lindh Custody.jpg|thumb|upright|[[John Walker Lindh]] was captured as an enemy combatant during the United States' [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|2001 invasion of Afghanistan]]]]

In a speech on 9 June 2005, Bush said that the USA PATRIOT Act had been used to bring charges against more than 400 suspects, more than half of whom had been convicted. Meanwhile, the ACLU quoted Justice Department figures showing that 7,000 people have complained of abuse of the Act.

The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ([[DARPA]]) began an initiative in early 2002 with the creation of the [[Total Information Awareness]] program, designed to promote information technologies that could be used in counter-terrorism. This program, facing criticism, has since been defunded by Congress.

By 2003, 12 major conventions and protocols were designed to combat terrorism. These were adopted and ratified by many states. These conventions require states to co-operate on principal issues regarding unlawful seizure of aircraft, the physical protection of nuclear materials, and the freezing of assets of militant networks.<ref>Cindy C Combs (2003), ''Terrorism in the Twenty First Century'', (3rd Edition, New Jersey: Pearsons Educ. Inc.)</ref>

In 2005, the UN Security Council adopted [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1624|Resolution 1624]] concerning incitement to commit acts of terrorism and the obligations of countries to comply with international human rights laws.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/sc/ctc/ |title=UN Security Council Counter-Terrorism Committee |publisher=United Nations |access-date=26 March 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100611145715/http://www.un.org/sc/ctc/ |archive-date=11 June 2010}}</ref> Although both resolutions require mandatory annual reports on counter-terrorism activities by adopting nations, the United States and Israel have both declined to submit reports. In the same year, the [[United States Department of Defense]] and the [[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]] issued a planning document, by the name "National Military Strategic Plan for the War on Terrorism", which stated that it constituted the "comprehensive military plan to prosecute the Global War on Terror for the [[Military of the United States|Armed Forces of the United States]]...including the findings and recommendations of the [[9/11 Commission]] and a rigorous examination with the Department of Defense".

On 9 January 2007, the House of Representatives passed a bill, by a vote of 299–128, enacting many of the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission The bill passed in the U.S. Senate,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=110&session=1&vote=00073|title=U.S. Senate: Roll Call Vote|date=27 January 2015|website=senate.gov|access-date=25 June 2015}}</ref> by a vote of 60–38, on 13 March 2007 and it was signed into law on 3 August 2007 by President Bush. It became Public Law 110–53. In July 2012, U.S. Senate passed a resolution urging that the [[Haqqani Network]] be designated a [[U.S. State Department list of Foreign Terrorist Organizations|foreign terrorist organization]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/us-cong-votes-for-designating-haqqani-network-as-terror-group/980665/|title=US Cong votes for designating Haqqani network as terror group |date=28 July 2012|work=Indian Express}}</ref>

The [[Office of Strategic Influence]] was secretly created after 9/11 for the purpose of coordinating propaganda efforts but was closed soon after being discovered. The Bush administration implemented the [[Continuity of Operations Plan]] (or Continuity of Government) to ensure that U.S. government would be able to continue in catastrophic circumstances.

Since 9/11, extremists made various attempts to attack the United States, with varying levels of organization and skill. For example, vigilant passengers aboard a transatlantic flight prevented [[Richard Reid (shoe bomber)|Richard Reid]], in 2001, and [[Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab]], in 2009, from detonating an explosive device.

Other terrorist plots have been stopped by federal agencies using new legal powers and investigative tools, sometimes in cooperation with foreign governments.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

Such thwarted attacks include:
* The [[2001 shoe bomb plot]]
* A plan to crash airplanes into the [[U.S. Bank Tower (Los Angeles)|U.S. Bank Tower]] (aka Library Tower) in Los Angeles
* The 2003 plot by [[Iyman Faris]] to blow up the [[Brooklyn Bridge]] in New York City
* The [[2004 Financial buildings plot]], which targeted the [[International Monetary Fund]] and [[World Bank]] buildings in Washington, D.C., the [[New York Stock Exchange]] and other financial institutions
* The 2004 [[Columbus Shopping Mall Bombing Plot]]
* The [[2006 Sears Tower plot]]
* The [[2007 Fort Dix attack plot]]
* The [[2007 John F. Kennedy International Airport attack plot]]
* The [[Najibullah Zazi|New York Subway Bombing Plot]] and [[2010 Times Square car bombing attempt]]

The Obama administration has promised the closing of the [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp]], increased the number of troops in [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Afghanistan]], and promised the withdrawal of its forces from [[War in Iraq|Iraq]].

After the September 11 attacks, the United States government commenced a program of illegal "[[extraordinary rendition]]," sometimes referred to as "irregular rendition" or "forced rendition," the government-sponsored [[kidnapping|abduction]] and [[extrajudicial]] transfer of a person from one country to transferee countries, with the consent of transferee countries.<ref name="54 countries">{{cite news |author=Max Fisher |title=A staggering map of the 54 countries that reportedly participated in the CIA's rendition program|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2013/02/05/a-staggering-map-of-the-54-countries-that-reportedly-participated-in-the-cias-rendition-program/ |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=5 February 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/may/22/us-extraordinary-rendition-programme|title=New light shed on US government's extraordinary rendition programme|first1=Ian|last1=Cobain|first2=James|last2=Ball|date=22 May 2013|work=The Guardian}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/28/cia-photographed-naked-detainees|title=CIA photographed detainees naked before sending them to be tortured|first=Spencer |last=Ackerman|date=28 March 2016|work=The Guardian}}</ref> The aim of extraordinary rendition is often conducting [[torture]] on the detainee that would be difficult to conduct in the U.S. legal environment, a practice known as [[torture by proxy]].

===Rendition to "Black Sites"===
In 2005, ''The Washington Post'' and [[Human Rights Watch]] (HRW) published revelations concerning kidnapping of detainees by the [[U.S. Central Intelligence Agency]] and their transport to "[[black site]]s," covert prisons operated by the CIA whose existence is denied by the US government. The [[European Parliament]] published a report connecting use of such secret detention Black Sites for detainees kidnapped as part of extraordinary rendition (''[[Extraordinary rendition#The European Parliament's 14 February 2007 report|See below]]''). Although some Black Sites have been known to exist inside [[European Union]] states, these detention centers violate the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] (ECHR) and the [[United Nations Convention Against Torture|UN Convention Against Torture]], treaties that all EU member states are bound to follow.<ref>{{cite news |title=Europeans Probe Secret CIA Flights |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/11/16/AR2005111602198.html |access-date=18 December 2005 |work=The Washington Post |first=Craig |last=Whitlock |date=17 November 2005}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title= EU to look into 'secret US jails' |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4403166.stm |access-date=18 December 2005 |work=BBC News |date=3 November 2005}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=U.S. Faces Scrutiny Over Secret Prisons |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/11/03/AR2005110300422.html |access-date=18 December 2005 |work=The Washington Post |first=Craig |last=Whitlock |date=4 November 2005}}</ref> The U.S. had ratified the United Nations Convention Against Torture in 1994.<ref>United Nations Treaty Collection, [https://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&mtdsg_no=IV-9&chapter=4&clang=_en Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment]</ref>

According to [[ABC News]] two such facilities, in countries mentioned by Human Rights Watch, have been closed following the recent publicity with the CIA relocating the detainees. Almost all of these detainees were tortured as part of the "[[enhanced interrogation techniques]]" of the CIA.<ref name="AbcNews051205">{{cite news |title=Exclusive: Sources Tell ABC News Top Al Qaeda Figures Held in Secret CIA Prisons |url=https://abcnews.go.com/WNT/Investigation/story?id=1375123 |access-date=18 December 2005 |publisher=ABC News |date=5 December 2005}}</ref>

====Criticism of American Media's Withholding of Coverage====
Major American newspapers, such as "[[The Washington Post]]," have been criticized for deliberately withholding publication of articles reporting locations of Black Sites. The Post defended its decision to suppress this news on the ground that such revelations "could open the [[U.S. government]] to legal challenges, particularly in foreign courts, and increase the risk of political condemnation at home and abroad." However, according to [[Fairness and Accuracy In Reporting]] "the possibility that illegal, unpopular government actions might be disrupted is not a consequence to be feared, however—it's the whole point of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|U.S. First Amendment]]. ... Without the basic fact of where these prisons are, it's difficult if not impossible for 'legal challenges' or 'political condemnation' to force them to close." FAIR argued that the damage done to the global reputation of the United States by the continued existence of black-site prisons was more dangerous than any threat caused by the exposure of their locations.<ref name="FAIR 2005">{{cite web |title=The Consequences of Covering Up |url=http://www.fair.org/index.php?page=2715 |access-date=18 December 2005}}</ref>

<blockquote>The complex at Stare Kiejkuty, a Soviet-era compound once used by German intelligence in World War II, is best known as having been the only Russian intelligence training school to operate outside the Soviet Union. Its prominence in the Soviet era suggests that it may have been the facility first identified—but never named—when the Washington Post's Dana Priest revealed the existence of the CIA's secret prison network in November 2005.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rawstory.com/news/2007/Sovietera_compound_in_Poland_was_site_0307.html|title=The Raw Story &#124; Soviet-era compound in northern Poland was site of secret CIA interrogation, detentions|website=www.rawstory.com}}</ref></blockquote>

The journalists who exposed this provided their sources and this information and documents were provided to ''The Washington Post'' in 2005. In addition, they also identified such Black Sites are concealed:

{{quote|Former European and US intelligence officials indicate that the secret prisons across the European Union, first identified by the Washington Post, are likely not permanent locations, making them difficult to identify and locate.

What some believe was a network of secret prisons was most probably a series of facilities used temporarily by the United States when needed, officials say. Interim "black sites"—secret facilities used for covert activities—can be as small as a room in a government building, which only becomes a black site when a prisoner is brought in for short-term detainment and interrogation.}}

The journalists went on to explain that "Such a site, sources say, would have to be near an airport." The airport in question is the [[Szczytno-Szymany International Airport]].

In response to these allegations, former Polish intelligence chief, [[Zbigniew Siemiatkowski]], embarked on a media blitz and claimed that the allegations were "... part of the domestic political battle in the US over who is to succeed current Republican President George W Bush," according to the German news agency Deutsche Presse Agentur.<ref>{{cite web |title=Former Polish intelligence chief who says report on CIA detention site part of US domestic battle admitted CIA had access to facility |work=The Raw Story |url=http://rawstory.com/news/2007/Former_Polish_intelligence_chief_who_says_0308.html}}</ref>

==== Prison ships ====
The United States has also been accused of operating "[[Prison ship|floating prisons]]" to house and transport those arrested in its [[war on terror#US objectives|''War on Terror'']], according to human rights lawyers. They have claimed that the US has tried to conceal the numbers and whereabouts of detainees. Although no credible information to support these assertions has ever come to light, the alleged justification for prison ships is primarily to remove the ability for jihadists to target a fixed location to facilitate the escape of high value targets, commanders, operations chiefs etc.<ref>{{cite news|author1=Duncan Campbell |author2=Richard Norton-Taylor |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jun/02/usa.humanrights |title=US accused of holding terror suspects on prison ships |work=The Guardian |location=London |date=2 June 2008|access-date=17 July 2010}}</ref>

===Total terrorist casualties===
The total number of terrorist/insurgent/militant deaths since the commencement of the War on Terror in 2001 is generally estimated as being well into the hundreds of thousands, with hundreds of thousands of others captured or arrested.

'''Iraq:'''

In Iraq, some 26,544 insurgents were killed by the American-led coalition and the Iraqi Security Forces from 2003 to 2011.<ref>597 killed in 2003,[https://www.usatoday.com/news/world/iraq/2007-09-26-insurgents_N.htm], 23,984 killed from 2004 through 2009 (with the exceptions of May 2004 and March 2009),[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/oct/22/true-civilian-body-count-iraq] 652 killed in May 2004,[http://www.iraqbodycount.org/analysis/numbers/warlogs/] 45 killed in March 2009,[http://www.reliefweb.int/rw/rwb.nsf/db900sid/CJAL-7QPQB7?OpenDocument] 676 killed in 2010,[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-12-30/iraq-civilian-deaths-drop-for-third-year-as-toll-eases-after-u-s-drawdown.html] and 590 killed in 2011,[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Aia6y6NymliRdEZESktBSWVqNWM1dkZOSGNIVmtFZEE#gid=4] thus giving a total of 26,544 dead</ref> 119,752 suspected insurgents were arrested in Iraq from 2003 to 2007 alone, at which point 18,832 suspected insurgents had been reported killed;<ref>[https://www.stripes.com/news/insurgent-body-count-records-released-1.69423 "Insurgent body count documents released."] Stars and Stripes. 1 October 2007. Number of convictions not specified.</ref> applying this same arrested-to-captured ratio to the total number of insurgents killed would equate to approximately 26,500 insurgents killed and 168,000 arrested from 2003 to 2011. At least 4,000 foreign fighters ([[Iraqi insurgency (2003-2011)#Foreign participants|generally estimated at 10-20% of the insurgency]] at that point) had been killed by September 2006, according to an official statement from [[Al-Qaeda in Iraq]].<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/sep/28/iraq "4,000 fighters killed, 'al-Qaida in Iraq' tape says."] The Guardian.

'''Afghanistan'''

Insurgent and terrorist deaths in Afghanistan are hard to estimate. [[Afghan Taliban]] losses are most likely of a similar scale to Afghan National Army and Police losses; that is around 62,000 from 2001 to the end of 2018.<ref>Rod Nordland; Mujib Mashal (26 January 2019).

'''Pakistan'''

The [[War in Northwest Pakistan]] resulted in the deaths of 28,900+ militants from 2004 to 2018, with an unknown number captured, per the Pakistani government.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://satp.org/datasheet-terrorist-attack/fatalities/pakistan-khyberpakhtunkhwa|title=Database – KPK from 2005 to present|access-date=24 May 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://satp.org/datasheet-terrorist-attack/fatalities/pakistan-fata|title=Database – FATA from 2005 to present|access-date=24 May 2019}}</ref> The majority of these were killed in engagements with the [[Pakistan Armed Forces]].

From 2014 to the end of 2017, the United States government stated that over 80,000 Islamic State insurgents had been killed by American and allied airstrikes from 2014 to the end of 2017, in both Iraq and Syria. The majority of these strikes occurred within Iraq.<ref>[https://www.straitstimes.com/world/middle-east/once-promised-paradise-isis-fighters-end-up-in-mass-graves "Once promised paradise, ISIS fighters end up in mass graves".] The Straits Times. 15 October 2017.

[[File:World Can't Wait J4 Demo.jpg|thumb|Participants in a rally, dressed as hooded detainees]]
Criticism of the War on Terror addressed the issues, morality, efficiency, economics, and other questions surrounding the War on Terror and made against the phrase itself, calling it a [[misnomer]]. The notion of a "war" against "terrorism" has proven highly contentious, with critics charging that it has been exploited by participating governments to pursue long-standing policy/military objectives,<ref name="Monbiot2003">[[George Monbiot]], [http://www.monbiot.com/archives/2003/03/11/a-wilful-blindness "A Wilful Blindness"] ("Those who support the coming war with Iraq refuse to see that it has anything to do with US global domination"), ''monbiot.com'' (author's website archives), reposted from ''[[The Guardian]]'', 11 March 2003. Retrieved 28 May 2007.</ref> reduce [[civil liberties]],<ref name="Wired-FBI">{{cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2008/03/fbi-tried-to-co/|title=FBI Tried to Cover Patriot Act Abuses With Flawed, Retroactive Subpoenas, Audit Finds|last=Singel|first=Ryan|date=13 March 2008|work=Wired |access-date=13 February 2012}}</ref> and infringe upon human rights. It is argued that the term war is not appropriate in this context (as in [[War on Drugs]]) since there is no identifiable enemy and that it is unlikely international terrorism can be brought to an end by military means.<ref name="Richissin">{{cite news|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2002023596_russanal02.html |title="War on terror" difficult to define |last=Richissin |first=Todd |date=2 September 2004 |work=The Baltimore Sun |access-date=28 January 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090114085106/http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2002023596_russanal02.html |archive-date=14 January 2009}}</ref>

Other critics, such as [[Francis Fukuyama]], note that "[[Definition of terrorism|terrorism]]" is not an enemy, but a tactic; calling it a "war on terror", obscures differences between conflicts such as anti-occupation [[Insurgency|insurgents]] and international [[mujahideen]]. With a military presence in [[Iraq]] and [[Afghanistan]] and its associated collateral damage, [[Shirley Williams]] maintains this increases resentment and terrorist threats against the West.<ref>Williams, Shirley.

==Anti-terror campaigns by other powers==
In the 2010s, [[People's Republic of China|China]] has also been engaged in its own War on Terror, predominantly a domestic campaign in response to violent actions by [[Uyghur people|Uyghur]] separatist movements in the [[Xinjiang conflict]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cfr.org/china/chinas-war-terror-september-11-uighur-separatism/p4765|title=China's 'War on Terror': September 11 and Uighur Separatism|publisher=Council on Foreign Relations|access-date=10 September 2015}}</ref> This campaign was widely criticized in international media due to the perception that it unfairly targets and [[persecutes]] [[Chinese Muslims]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/chinas-war-on-terror-becomes-all-out-attack-on-islam-in-xinjiang/2014/09/19/5c5840a4-1aa7-4bb6-bc63-69f6bfba07e9_story.html|title=China's war on terror becomes all-out attack on Islam in Xinjiang|author=Simon Denyer|date=19 September 2014|website=Washington Post|access-date=10 September 2015}}</ref> potentially resulting in a negative backlash from [[China]]'s predominantly [[Muslim]] [[Uyghur people|Uighur]] population. [[Xi Jinping]]'s government has imprisoned up to 2 million [[Uyghurs]] and other [[Islam in China|Muslim]] ethnic minorities in [[Xinjiang re-education camps]], where they are reportedly subject to abuse and torture.<ref>{{cite news |title=Saudi crown prince defended China's imprisonment of a million Muslims in internment camps, giving Xi Jinping a reason to continue his 'precursors to genocide' |url=https://www.businessinsider.com/saudi-crown-prince-defends-china-oppression-of-muslims-in-xinjiang-mohammed-bin-salman-2019-2 |work=Business Insider |date=23 February 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Saudi crown prince defends China's right to fight 'terrorism' |url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/02/saudi-crown-prince-defends-china-fight-terrorism-190223104647149.html |work=al-Jazeera |date=23 February 2019}}</ref>

[[Russia]] has also been engaged on its own, also largely internally focused, counter-terrorism campaign often termed a war on terror, during the [[Second Chechen War]], the [[Insurgency in the North Caucasus]], and the [[Russian military intervention in the Syrian Civil War]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://content.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2093529,00.html |work=Time |title=How the War on Terrorism Did Russia a Favor |date=19 September 2011}}</ref> Like [[China]]'s war on terror, [[Russia]] has also been focused on [[separatist]] and [[Islamist]] movements that use [[political violence]] to achieve their ends.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gwu.edu/~ieresgwu/assets/docs/demokratizatsiya%20archive/10-4_Cohen.PDF |title=Russia, Islam, and the War on Terrorism |first=Ariel |last=Cohen |access-date=29 November 2015}}</ref>
