'''''Joey''''' is<!-- Do not change to "was" see WP:MOSTV#Lead_paragraphs --> an American [[sitcom]] created by [[Scott Silveri]] and [[Shana Goldberg-Meehan]] and a [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]]/[[sequel]] to ''[[Friends]]'', starring [[Matt LeBlanc]] reprising his role as [[Joey Tribbiani]]. It premiered on the [[NBC]] television network, on September 9, 2004, in the former time slot of its parent series, Thursday nights at 8:00&nbsp;p.m.

Midway through the second season, the show was placed on a [[Hiatus (television)|hiatus]] by NBC but returned on March 7, 2006, in a new timeslot of Tuesdays at 8:30&nbsp;p.m. Only one episode, "Joey and the Snowball Fight", was shown in this new timeslot before the show was pulled by NBC when it was overshadowed in ratings by ''[[American Idol]]''. [[NBC]] canceled the series due to poor ratings on August 23, 2006.

==Overview==
This series centers on Joey Tribbiani, who has struck out on his own and moved to Hollywood, hoping to truly make it as an actor. Joey says goodbye to a time when his friends were his family and welcomes the chance to turn his family into his friends. After reuniting with his high-strung sister Gina, a strong and sexy hairdresser, Joey moves in with his genius 20-year-old nephew, graduate student Michael who is literally a rocket scientist. What Joey lacks in book smarts, however, he more than makes up for with his people skills, making him the best new friend his nephew could ask for. In the process, he begins a tentative romance with his superintendent, Alexis Garrett, and becomes close friends with fellow aspiring actor, Zach Miller.

==Cast and characters==
{{Main|List of Friends and Joey characters}}
* [[Matt LeBlanc]] as [[Joey Tribbiani]], a struggling actor and [[Gourmand|food-lover]] who becomes famous for his role on ''[[Days of Our Lives]]'' as Dr. Drake Ramoray. Joey is a womanizer with many girlfriends throughout the series, in keeping with his character on ''[[Friends]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/topic/zap-ronleavittobit,0,4424382.story |title=''Married ... With Children'' Co-Creator Dies |accessdate=December 23, 2008|author=McLellan, Dennis |date=February 12, 2008 |publisher=[[The Baltimore Sun]]}}</ref> The series roughly picks up where ''[[Friends]]'' left off, with Joey at the beginning of the show making a move from New York to Los Angeles to proceed with his acting career. He is constantly talking about food or eating sandwiches or pizza.
* [[Drea de Matteo]] as Joey's attractive older sister Gina Tribbiani, who is temperamental and [[Promiscuity|promiscuous]]. Not particularly bright but very street-wise, Gina is a caring but over-protective and domineering mother. For years she convinced her genius son Michael that he was born when she was 22 instead of 16 years old, and always says he is the one thing she has done well. She and Joey are friends in addition to being siblings, both having the gift of being extremely appealing to the opposite sex, with numerous lovers. Initially working as a hairdresser, by season two she works as a secretary for Joey's agent Bobbie, having impressed Bobbie with her brash manner. In season two she starts dating Michael's father Jimmy once again. In the Season 2 episode "Joey and the Holding Hands", it is implied that Gina may be bisexual.
* [[Andrea Anders]] as Alexis "Alex" Garrett, the next door neighbor, landlady and friend. She is an educated, but slightly ditzy, blonde lawyer who graduated from [[Northwestern University]] and [[Pepperdine University School of Law]]. Initially intimidated, but also intrigued by Joey's tough street-wise older sister Gina, the two women eventually become friends, and she becomes more bold in the way she dresses and acts, thanks to Gina's influence. She is puzzled but impressed by Joey's intuitive ''gift'' at being able to know when she is wearing [[thong]] panties, and spends most of her time hanging out at Joey and Michael's apartment. She and Joey bond and become close friends. Her husband is a professional [[orchestra]] musician and is away from home most of the time, and she confides her problems with her marriage in Joey. At the end of season one, she and Joey become romantically involved during her separation from her husband. In season two she becomes romantically interested in Joey and has a crush on him for a long period. Gina tries to help her to get over Joey, but once Alex starts dating Joey's friend Dean, Joey soon realizes that he is also in love with Alex. Shortly after the series ended, Anders and LeBlanc entered a relationship for nine years.
* [[Paulo Costanzo]] as Joey's nephew Michael Tribbiani who idolises his Uncle Joey's ability to date many women, and who himself is sheltered and nervous around girls. He is self-conscious that he has been so sheltered and that his mother Gina breast fed him until he was seven. Early in the second season it is revealed that Michael has [[Asperger syndrome]]. He is a huge ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' and ''[[Star Wars]]'' fan. He is extremely intelligent, an [[aerospace engineer]], attends [[California Institute of Technology|Caltech]] and specialises in applied [[thermodynamics]], works with his rival Seth frequently on [[engineering]] projects, and is an obvious direct opposite from his more street-wise mother and uncle. He turns to Joey as a big brother and substitute father figure, even after his biological father Jimmy re-enters mother Gina's love life. 
* [[Jennifer Coolidge]] as Joey's oversexed agent Roberta "Bobbie" Morganstern, and reportedly the twelfth most powerful woman in Hollywood. She has an enormous crush on Joey's nephew Michael. She often entertains herself by making her office assistant do funny tricks, or shocking herself with a stun-gun. She is brash, forward, aggressive, highly entertaining and slightly ditzy, laughing at everything and at anyone's expense, including her client Joey's. She was once sued by [[Phil Collins]].
* [[Miguel A. Núñez Jr.]] joined the cast at the start of season two as the character Zach Miller. He soon became one of Joey's best friends. Zach has an interesting career, going from playing extras on TV, to directing amateur plays. Zach does not appear to have a home; he was seen at one time living in Joey's trailer while working on a major blockbuster movie. In one episode, Zach and Joey, both drunk, married in Tijuana, possibly a parody of Ross and Rachel marrying each other in the season-five finale of ''Friends''. Zach's final appearance was in "[[Joey and the Big Move]]". Núñez was absent from the last five episodes, including the finale of the series, because he found another job. Zach's absence within the show was not mentioned, nor was the character at all.
* [[Ben Falcone]] as Howard, Joey's friend and neighbor.

Several cast members had previously appeared as different characters in ''Friends''; Coolidge appeared as Amanda, an old friend of Monica and Phoebe, in a tenth-season episode. [[Adam Goldberg]], who played Jimmy, appeared in ''Friends''{{'}} second season in the recurring role of Eddie, who moves in with Chandler after Joey moves out. [[Carlos Gómez (actor)|Carlos Gómez]], who played Sam the director, appeared in one episode of ''Friends'' as the restaurant worker Julio in "The One with All the Jealousy". [[Patrick Kerr]], who played the producer of the Daytime Soap Awards, appeared in one episode of ''Friends'' as a restaurant manager who auditions Monica for a job as a chef. [[Brent Spiner]], who played himself, appeared in one episode of ''Friends'' as James Campbell, who interviews Rachel for a job.

Additionally, [[Robert Costanzo]] reprised his role as Joey's father, Joey Tribbiani Sr., who originated in the first season of ''Friends'', in "Joey and the Dad". Costanzo was the only actor besides LeBlanc to play the same character in this series as in ''Friends'' (Gina appeared in a third-season episode of ''Friends'', but was not played by Drea de Matteo; Joey's sister Mary Theresa also appeared in a third-season ''Friends'' episode, but was played by a different actress than on ''Joey'').

[[Simon Helberg]] appeared in four episodes as Seth Tobin, a nerdy engineer and friend/rival of Michael who shared many similarities with one of Helberg's later characters, [[Howard Wolowitz]] in ''[[The Big Bang Theory]]''.

==Background and development==
After the series finale of ''Friends'' in 2004, LeBlanc signed on for the spin-off series, ''Joey'', following Joey's move to Los Angeles to pursue his acting career. ''Friends'' producers [[Marta Kauffman]] and [[David Crane (producer)|David Crane]] were not interested in the spin-off, although [[Kevin S. Bright]] agreed to be executive producer along with ''Joey'' creators, [[Scott Silveri]] and [[Shana Goldberg-Meehan]],<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2003-07-23-joey_x.htm |title=NBC has sitcom plans for ''Friends'' pal Joey |accessdate=December 30, 2008 |author=Levin, Gary |date=July 24, 2003 |publisher=[[USA Today]]}}</ref> the latter of whom left the show after the first season and was replaced by Jon Pollack.

The [[Television pilot|pilot episode]] was released in [[screener (promotional)|screener]] for test audiences and members of the entertainment industry to preview the show and drum up business. The screener was subsequently leaked on the [[Internet]] and thus has received a much wider critical review process than initially conceived.<ref>{{cite web| author=Digital Spy| url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/ustv/a14898/joey-pilot-leaked-onto-net.html| title='Joey' pilot leaked onto net| accessdate=2007-08-15}}</ref> There were few differences between the unbroadcast pilot and the version that was broadcast. [[Ashley Scott]] played the role of Allison in the unbroadcast pilot,<ref>{{cite web|author=News Bank|date=June 12, 2004|title='JOEY' GETS CASTING CHANGE|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=CO&s_site=charlotte&p_multi=CO&p_theme=realcities&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=10334167A01F3DD4&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121026002630/http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=CO&s_site=charlotte&p_multi=CO&p_theme=realcities&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=10334167A01F3DD4&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM|archive-date=October 26, 2012|accessdate=2007-08-15|website=}}</ref> but was replaced by [[Andrea Anders]] and the character name changed to Alex.

The series did well in the [[Nielsen ratings]] in its first season (2004–2005) and was subsequently renewed for a second season (2005–2006). In the second season, [[Miguel A. Núñez Jr.]] was added to the show as a series regular and [[Jennifer Coolidge]] had a more prominent role. The show was pulled from its Thursday-night timeslot in December 2005, and NBC returned the show in a new timeslot (Tuesdays at 8pm) on March 7, 2006. Due in part to being in competition with ''[[American Idol]]'', ''Joey'' was the lowest-rated prime time program of the week for NBC.<ref>[http://www.tvweek.com/docs/docs/chart031706.pdf tvweek.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061230075708/http://www.tvweek.com/docs/docs/chart031706.pdf |date=December 30, 2006 }}</ref> The network pulled the series after the first Tuesday broadcast and its cancellation was announced on May 15, 2006. The remaining episodes have never been broadcast by NBC, but have been shown on various other networks around the world. Episode 5 and Episode 13 of season 1 were directed by [[David Schwimmer]], who played [[Ross Geller]] in ''Friends''.

{{quote |On ''Friends'', Joey was a womanizer, but we enjoyed his exploits. He was a solid friend, a guy you knew you could count on. Joey was deconstructed to be a guy who couldn't get a job, couldn't ask a girl out. He became a pathetic, mopey character. I felt he was moving in the wrong direction, but I was not heard. |[[Kevin S. Bright]] on the reason for ''Joey''{{'}}s cancellation.<ref name="friendsjoeystuff"/>}}
