Born in [[Staten Island]] of [[New York City]] and raised in [[Pennsylvania]], Aguilera appeared on television shows in her early years, before gaining a recording contract with [[RCA Records]] in 1998. Her [[Christina Aguilera (album)|self-titled debut album]], released in 1999, reached number one in the US and spawned three US number-one singles: "[[Genie in a Bottle]]", "[[What a Girl Wants (Christina Aguilera song)|What a Girl Wants]]", and "[[Come On Over Baby (All I Want Is You)]]". While recognized as a prominent figure in the contemporary [[teen pop]] scene, Aguilera sought to assume artistic control with ''[[Stripped (Christina Aguilera album)|Stripped]]'' (2002) and its lead single "[[Dirrty]]", which displayed her sexuality. The second single from the album, "[[Beautiful (Christina Aguilera song)|Beautiful]]", received favorable response for its empowering lyrics and became an anthem for the [[LGBT community]].

Aguilera scored her second US number-one album with ''[[Back to Basics (Christina Aguilera album)|Back to Basics]]'' (2006), which drew inspiration from early 20th-century [[jazz]], [[soul music|soul]], and [[blues]], and spawned the top-ten singles "[[Ain't No Other Man]]", "[[Hurt (Christina Aguilera song)|Hurt]]", and "[[Candyman (Christina Aguilera song)|Candyman]]". Her next three albums, ''[[Bionic (Christina Aguilera album)|Bionic]]'' (2010), ''[[Lotus (Christina Aguilera album)|Lotus]]'' (2012), and ''[[Liberation (Christina Aguilera album)|Liberation]]'' (2018), all experimented with various musical styles and reached the top ten in the US. Besides solo materials, Aguilera earned chart-topping entries with collaborations including "[[Lady Marmalade#Moulin Rouge! version|Lady Marmalade]]", "[[Moves like Jagger]]", "[[Feel This Moment]]", and "[[Say Something (A Great Big World song)|Say Something]]". Alongside her music career, Aguilera starred in the film ''[[Burlesque (2010 American film)|Burlesque]]'' (2010) and was a coach on six seasons of the singing competition television series ''[[The Voice (American TV series)|The Voice]]'' from 2011 to 2016.

She can belt and she can tease; she can aim a note as directly as a missile or turn its trajectory into an aerobatic spiral of leaping, quivering, scalloping melismas.
