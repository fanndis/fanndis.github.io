The [[European Union]] (EU) and EU member states, [[United States]], [[Russia]] and [[Canada]] (as well as [[Amnesty International]] and [[Human Rights Watch]]) expressed concern that the allegations against Tymoshenko did not constitute crimes and that the charges were politically motivated; the [[United Kingdom]] and the United States have stated that this also goes for the prosecuting of dozens other former ministers and officials; in particular former Ukrainian minister [[Bohdan Danylyshyn]] was granted [[political asylum]] in the [[Czech Republic]] in January 2011 ("because his prosecution may be politically motivated").<ref name=PMreactions>[http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/story/2011/10/11/ukraine-tymoshenko.html Ukraine's Tymoshenko given 7 years in jail], [[CBC News]] (11 October 2011)<br />[http://www.kyivpost.com/content/politics/reaction-to-tymoshenko-verdict-swift-and-harsh-114566.html Reaction to Tymoshenko verdict swift and harsh], [[Kyiv Post]] (11 October 2011)<br />[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/ukraine/8820383/Yulia-Tymoshenko-says-Ukraine-trial-like-Stalins-Soviet-Union-as-she-is-jailed-for-7-years.html Yulia Tymoshenko says Ukraine trial 'like Stalin's Soviet Union' as she is jailed for 7 years], [[telegraph.co.uk]] (11 October 2011)<br />[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/ukraine/9507147/Ukraine-minister-insists-Yulia-Tymoshenko-broke-the-law.html Ukraine minister insists Yulia Tymoshenko broke the law], [[telegraph.co.uk]] (29 August 2012)<br />[https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/10/11/us-ukraine-tymoshenko-idUSL5E7LB0OQ20111011 Ukraine jails Tymoshenko for 7 years, irks EU, Russia], [[Reuters]] (11 October 2011)<br />[http://www.praguepost.com/news/7161-ukrainian-ex-minister-gets-asylum.html Ukrainian ex-minister gets asylum], [[The Prague Post]] (19 January 2011)<br />[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-12-30/u-s-concerned-over-ukraine-s-prosecution-of-former-officials.html U.S. Concerned Over Ukraine’s Prosecution of Former Officials], [[Bloomberg L.P.]] (30 December 2010)<br />[http://www.interfax.co.uk/russia-news/u-s-state-department-points-to-politically-motivated-prosecution-of-former-officials-in-ukraine-in-its-human-rights-report/ U.S. State Department points to politically motivated prosecution of former officials in Ukraine in its human rights report], [[Interfax-Ukraine]] (24 May 2012)<br />[https://www.hrw.org/world-report-2012/world-report-2012-ukraine-0 World Report 2012: Ukraine], [[Human Rights Watch]]<br />[https://www.hrw.org/news/2012/06/11/few-more-goals-ukraine A few more goals for Ukraine], [[Human Rights Watch]] (11 June 2012)</ref>

:71. The analysis of key issues as presented above, in light of the criteria for the definition of political prisoners in Resolution 1900 (2012), leads to a fairly compelling result, namely that Ms Tymoshenko must be recognised as a presumed political prisoner:
:1) Ms Tymoshenko is a key opposition leader and main rival of the current President. She was sentenced to a particularly harsh seven-year prison term on the basis of vague abuse-of-office charges.
:2) These charges effectively criminalised the political decision she had taken as Prime Minister in favour of an agreement with Russia to end an acute crisis threatening the provision of gas to Ukraine and other European countries.
:3) The prosecution and trial were marred by numerous presumptive procedural violations.
:4) Ms Tymoshenko was also put under intense physical and psychological pressure, both during pretrial detention and in post-conviction custody. Her family, lawyers and political allies, in particular Mr Vlasenko, have also suffered from a co-ordinated campaign of harassment and persecution by the authorities.

==Criminal cases against Tymoshenko prior to 2010==
{{details|Yulia Tymoshenko#Deputy Prime Minister for fuel and energy}}
Criminal cases against Yulia Tymoshenko were initiated:
* In 2001 (before the parliamentary elections of 2002): in January in Ukraine;<ref name=dosie-rian2>{{cite web|author= |url=http://rian.ru/politics/20080909/151115415.html|title="Criminal cases by Yulia Tymoshenko.

* In 2004 ( before the presidential elections of 2004): in May in Ukraine; in September (15.09.2004) — in Russia.<ref name=dosie-rian2/>

Those cases were opened concerning [[United Energy Systems of Ukraine]] (UESU) activity in 1996–1997 years. In Ukraine, the UESU cases were closed at the beginning of 2005 (for lack of evidence);  in Russia - in December 2005 (as a result of expiry of the period of limitation).<ref name=dosie-rian/>

==Cases since 2010==
Certain analysts and Ukrainian politicians have pointed out that they believe that some [[Ukrainian oligarchs|Ukrainian business tycoons]] with "lucrative relations" with Russia are deliberately hindering [[Ukraine–European Union relations|Ukraine's European Union integration]] and are using Tymoshenko's trial as a tool in these attempts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kyivpost.com/news/nation/detail/119066/ |title=EU Hopes Fade As Gas Lobby Triumphs |publisher=Kyivpost.com |date= |accessdate=2014-03-21}}</ref> Tymoshenko is a former owner of [[United Energy Systems of Ukraine]].<ref name="Åslund"/>

===Reopening of the case of intent to bribe the judges of the Supreme Court in 2003===

In June 2004 (it was the beginning of the presidential elections in Ukraine) Tymoshenko was accused that she was going to bribe the judges of the Supreme Court in 2003 (exactly "was going to bribe", because there was no attempt to "transfer bribes") with the aim to release from jail her father-in-law [[Hennady Tymoshenko]] and Antonina Bolyura (both worked for [[United Energy Systems of Ukraine]]).<ref name=dosie-rian>{{cite web|author= |url=http://rian.ru/politics/20080909/151115415.html |title="The criminal case against Yulia Tymoshenko.

RIA Novyny. |publisher=Rian.ru |date=12.5.2011  |accessdate=2014-03-21}}</ref>

The essence of the criminal case: in June 2004, Ukrainian TV showed a video material — Yu. Tymoshenko (and her bodyguard) were shown in the office of some lawyer (it was he who made the recording) who had promised to procure in re-hearing Tymoshenko's father-in-law's lawsuit. Tymoshenko hurried up the lawyer and was disturbed with his resultless efforts despite money given to him. It is important to emphasize that Hennadi Tymoshenko in prison suffered a microinsult. Just based on that video recording, a criminal suit was initiated against Tymoshenko under the articles 15 part 2 and 369 part 1 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine. But this criminal case was closed in 2004, under [[Leonid Kuchma|Kuchma]] presidency.<ref name=rian-mai2>{{cite web |url=http://ria.ru/politics/20100512/233416152.html |script-title=ru:Тимошенко получила постановление о возбуждении уголовного дела |trans-title=Tymoshenko received the decision to institute criminal proceedings |work=РИА Новости |date=May 12, 2011|language=Russian }}</ref>

A 2004 criminal case against Tymoshenko on accusations she had planned to bribe [[Supreme Court of Ukraine|Supreme Court]] judges in 2003 — was reopened 12 May 2010.<ref name=Eoronews12510/><ref name=Telegraph13510>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/ukraine/7717602/Ukraine-reopens-bribery-case-against-Yulia-Tymoshenko.html Ukraine reopens bribery case against Yulia Tymoshenko], [[Telegraph.co.uk]] (13 May 2010)</ref> However, on this criminal case no message almost since its opening in 2010. This criminal case fell apart again.

It should also be said that [[Hennady Tymoshenko]] died May 24, 2012, aged 75 years. Yulia Tymoshenko at the time was in prison, she was not given permission to attend the funeral of the man, whom she called "father".

===Criminal cases involving "Kyoto money" and "ambulances for rural medicine"===

====Joint auditing by Minfin of Ukraine and the US firm Trout Cacheris====

On 5 May 2010 [[First Azarov Government|Azarov's Cabinet of Ministers]] made a decision to attract the firm [http://www.troutcacheris.com/ Trout Cacheris PLLC (Washington)] to audit Timoshenko's office activities in 2007–2010 years (two more firms, [http://www.akingump.com/en/index.html Akim Gump] and an [[Kroll Inc.|Investigation Agency Kroll Inc.]], were hired as subcontractors). More than 10 mln US dollars were planned to pay for auditing.<ref name=audyt1>{{cite web |url=http://glavcom.ua/articles/1964.html |script-title=uk:На аудит деятельности Тимошенко потратили $10 млн |trans-title=$10 million spent on the audit of Tymoshenko |work=Главком |date=October 20, 2010 |language=Ukrainian |access-date=August 20, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130922141403/http://glavcom.ua/articles/1964.html |archive-date=September 22, 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

On 15 October 2010 (after abolition of the Ukrainian Constitution on October, the 1st and before the beginning of the regional elections on October, the 31st), Azarov government (namely, Auditing Department of Financial Ministry) completed auditing [[Second Tymoshenko Government|Tymoshenko's second government]] activities. The two US firms were involved in auditing – [http://www.troutcacheris.com/ Trout Cacheris PLLC] and [http://www.akingump.com/en/index.html Akim Gump] (it could be seen indicative that the US Embassy in Ukraine set themselves apart from those firms). Upon completion of the auditing, the Auditing Department of [[Ministry of Finance (Ukraine)|the Ukrainian Ministry of Finance]] declared 43 bln grn (that is $5 billion) "misuse" of state money. However, а month later this amount was 15 times reduced and the money appeared not to be "stolen" but transferred to the Ukrainian Pension Fund. Actually, it was the money (320 mln euros) received from selling to Japan a "greenhouse gas emanation quota".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://censor.net.ua/news/147615/pravitelstvo_ukrainy_sdelalo_ofitsialnoe_zayavlenie_po_kiotskomu_protokolu__obnovleno |script-title=uk:Правительство Украины сделало официальное заявление по Киотскому протоколу |trans-title=The Government of Ukraine made an official statement on the Kyoto Protocol |date=December 21, 2010 |work=Цензор.НЕТ|language=Ukrainian }}</ref> Such a transaction was quite a new for Ukraine, and Tymoshenko government were proud to implement it, the more so that it was done at the time of the "world global crisis 2008-2009".

Tymoshenko was charged with, principally, two violations, on which basis the two criminal cases were opened:

1) On 2 December 2010 Yulia Tymoshenko was first called to the Procurator's Office of Ukraine as for the "Kyoto money" case. Tymoshenko was accused of transferring 320 mln euros, the money which had been received from selling Japan a "greenhouse gas emanation quota" to the Ukrainian Pension Fund (in [[Great Recession|2009 year of global crisis]]) instead of spending it for planting forests (as required by [[Kyoto Protocol]]). On the 30th of December (on the very eve of the New Year celebration) she was under interrogation during 12 hours in a row (from 12 a.m. to 12 p.m.).

On 16 December 2010 Ukrainian law enforcers started a criminal case against Tymoshenko for illegal use of funds - the money (that [[Carbon emission trading|Ukraine received for selling their quotas under the Kyoto Protocol]]) was transferred to the Pension Fund of Ukraine, and used for the payment of pensions to the population of Ukraine.<ref name=RT16122010>[http://rt.com/politics/criminal-former-pm-tymoshenko/ Ukraine launches criminal case against former PM Timoshenko], [[RT (TV network)|Russia Today]] (16 December 2010)</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://en.ria.ru/world/20101220/161856389.html |title=Tymoshenko government accused of misappropriating $8.5 mln to advocate Ukraine's image |work=[[RIA Novosti]] |date=December 20, 2010}}</ref> Tymoshenko had to give a pledge not to leave the country (the same day).<ref name=RT16122010/>

2) On 27 January 2011 the case on purchasing, in 2009, a thousand of [[Opel Combo]] ambulances for the needs of rural medicine was initiated (Tymoshenko was incriminated spending funds in a way that was not envisaged in the 2009 state budget). The cars were supplied from [[Austria]] on credit terms (with payment in 2010) at the price of 12.5 thousand euros (the price did not exceed that on the market). Tymoshenko was charged under the article 365, p.&nbsp;3, the article 364, p.&nbsp;2, the article 210, p.&nbsp;2 of the [[Criminal Code of Ukraine]] (that is, exceeding official authorities; infringement of Budget Law; abuse of office charges, that led to badly unfavourable consequences).<ref name=kommersant2dela>{{cite web |url=http://www.kommersant.ua/doc/1590074 |script-title=uk:Дела объединились вокруг Юлии Тимошенко |trans-title=The cases combined against Yulia Tymoshenko |work=Коммерсантъ Украина |date=February 22, 2011|language=Ukrainian }}</ref>

In all those cases, procurators do not blame Yu. V. Tymoshenko either in stealing the funds, or in doing the damage, the basis of charges being money misuse.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.segodnya.ua/news/14184140.html |title=(Russian language) Auditing on Tymoshenko caused world-wide response |publisher=Segodnya.ua |date=2010-10-15 |accessdate=2014-03-21}}</ref>

====Travel restrictions. Tymoshenko’s stay in Brussels on March 24–26, 2011====
On 15 December 2010 the General Procurator's Office imposed on Tymoshenko "travel restrictions" as a preventive measure. Yet Tymoshenko managed to leave Ukraine for Brussels where she was present (on March, 24-26, 2011) at the summit of the [[European People's Party]] at the personal invitations of its leader [[Wilfried Martens]] and the US senator [[John McCain]]. Tymoshenko had meetings with the European leading politicians like German Chancellor [[Angela Merkel]] and [[President Sarkozy]].

====BBC: Authoritative lawyers versus less authoritative auditors (June, 17th, 2011)====
On 17 June 2011 in Washington there was a press-conference (see YouTube<ref name=BDO>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FmST9w0-b4 |title=Company Covington & Burling LLP and BDO concluded that the charges against Tymoshenko are politically motivated |publisher=Youtube.com |date=2011-06-18 |accessdate=2014-03-21}}</ref>) of an authoritative American law firm "[[Covington & Burling]]" and a large auditing company "[[BDO Seidman|BDO USA]]" (having branch offices in more than 100 countries round the world) to which Yulia Tymoshenko and her party "[[Batkivshchyna]]" applied with the request to evaluate how justified were the charges incriminated to her, as well as to scrutinize the validity of the report ordered by the Azarov government and made by the American law firms "Trout Cacheris" and "[[Akin Gump]]" (their report was submitted on October, the 14th, 2010 and was used as a basis for initiating further charges against Yulia Tymoshenko).<ref name=BBC/>

At the above-mentioned conference, the lawyers concluded that: 
* "'''The paragraphs on "Kyoto money" and "Opel Combo ambulances" do not worth the paper on which they were printed...''' As for the current moment, the charges against the former Prime Minister (Tymoshenko) seem to be political by their origin, so as there are not any facts to substantiate them...

==2009 gas deal with Russia==
[[File:Судять.jpg|thumb|Tymoshenko in court (26 July 2011)]]

=== Reading the ruling for the gas case – 2009 ===

On June, the 24th, 2011, the Ukrainian General Procurator’s Office delivered Yu. Tymoshenko the "Ruling for suing her on charges in compliance with the gas case-2009 (p.3 Article 365 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine – power abusing, or exceeding of office authorities resulted in ill effects", which envisages 7 to 10 years of imprisonment):
* "Prime Minister of Ukraine Tymoshenko Yu. V., acting purposefully and in personal interests, being aware of groundless and baseless requirements from the Russian part during the talks held in presence of her and the leadership of the government of the Russian Federation, the joint stock company Gazprom, and the national joint stock company Naftogaz Ukrainy … made a decision to adopt the a.m. unfavourable for Ukraine conditions" (from the Ruling of the General Procurator's Office of Ukraine to sue Tymoshenko as accused, p.&nbsp;5, 24 Jun 2011.)<ref name=obvinenie24>{{cite web|url=http://www.pravda.com.ua/articles/2011/07/4/6355821/ |title=Resolution of the General Prosecutor's Office of Ukraine on the prosecution accused Tymoshenko as for "gas contract with Russia-2009".

===The essence of "the gas case" in the report of PACE===

At the June session of [[Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe|PACE]] (2013) approved a report that focuses on the gas case of Timoshenko:
* "47. Ms Tymoshenko was sentenced to a seven-year prison term on the basis of vague abuse-of-office “Excess of authority” – Article 365 of the Ukrainian Criminal Code... 48. The criminal charge against the former Prime Minister was that the deal struck between her and Russian Prime Minister Putin was financially disadvantageous to Ukraine and that it had not been approved in writing beforehand by her cabinet. The political deal between the two prime ministers... was reached in a climate of severe crisis, after Mr Putin had ordered that gas supplies to Ukraine and through Ukraine to western Europe be cut on 5 January 2009. See [[The Economist]] of 8 January 2009 : ...“some countries felt the effect immediately, in bitterly cold weather. Hungary, Slovakia, Bulgaria and Romania were hit hard, but the gas freeze also affects Germany, France and Italy...” On 17 January 2009, Ms Tymoshenko, who was under intense pressure from the European Union and key western European leaders to unblock the situation, reached an agreement of principle with Mr Putin, in Moscow. On 19 January, Naftogas and Gazprom signed the contract... After Ms Tymoshenko's return, on 21 January, the cabinet confirmed the contracts, and on 22 January, the flow of Russian gas to Ukraine and to western Europe was fully restored... Astonishingly, the fact that the cabinet approved the deal two days later is not even mentioned in the judgment" ([https://web.archive.org/web/20131104025941/http://www.assembly.coe.int/ASP/XRef/X2H-DW-XSL.asp?fileid=19744&lang=EN PACE, Committee on Legal Affairs and Human Rights.

And later in this report said that Tymoshenko could be considered a political prisoner :
* "71. The analysis of key issues as presented above, in light of the criteria for the definition of political prisoners in Resolution 1900 (2012), leads to a fairly compelling result, namely that Ms Tymoshenko must be recognised as a presumed '''political prisoner'''" ([https://web.archive.org/web/20131104025941/http://www.assembly.coe.int/ASP/XRef/X2H-DW-XSL.asp?fileid=19744&lang=EN PACE.

=== Hearings of witnesses (from 26.07.2011) ===

Witnesses in the "gas case" were dozens of ex-ministers and known politicians.

As for the 26th of July 2011, it was planned to interrogate 38 witnesses for "the part of prosecution". The judge Kireyev gave admission to witness, for the Tymoshenko part, to just two people (out of 33 claimed) - Alexander Turchinov and Michail Lyvinsky. However even "witnesses for the prosecution part" were testifying, mainly, in favour of Tymoshenko. As a result, Tymoshenko wrote in her Twitter: "Kireyev was banned to call “our” witnesses, he got rebuked even for “theirs” (i.e. witnesses from prosecution)". On July, the 26th, 2011, i.e. just as soon as the process of witnessing started, direct teletransmitting from the trial room stopped.

===Witnessing by Oleg Dubina, former head of Naftogas, 29.07.2011 ===

The important moment in witnessing by [[Oleg Dubina]] (a former Head of Naftogaz) was his proving that "The Gas Agreement of 19.01.2009 was made on provisions that Ukraine could at any moment terminate it without whatever "penalty sanctions from the part of Russia".
* To the Tymoshenko's question whether Ukraine is enabled to cancel the agreement at any moment without whatever penalties, Dubina replied positively : "The agreement foresees penalty sanctions for underutilizing gas, but as for the Agreement itself, I can’t tell you for sure, but, I believe, it may be so".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ura-inform.com/ru/politics/2011/07/29/kontrakt |title="Ukraine can safely terminate the contract with Gazprom?". Site "Ura.inform", 29.07.2011 |publisher=Ura-inform.com |date=2011-07-29 |accessdate=2014-03-21}}</ref>

[[Oleg Dubina]] confirmed that the agreement with Russia was set the standard formula - the price of gas is calculated according to the price of oil.

===Witnessing as for the Yushchenko part===

It is worth mentioning that at the trial against Tymoshenko almost all the witnesses ([[Oleg Dubina]], [[Alexander Turchinov]] in particular) said that it was [[Victor Yushchenko|President Yushchenko]] himself who had ruined the price of US$235 per a thousand m<sup>3</sup> of gas agreed by Tymoshenko Cabinet for 2009 year; he had recalled [[Oleh Dubyna|Mr. Dubyna]], a Head of [[Naftogaz]], from Moscow (though [[Victor Yushchenko|Yushchenko]] was not authorized to do that). On the day of Yushchenko witnessing (17.08.2011), Russian mass media sources published the commentary of "a representative from the Kremlin", who said : 
* "Yushchenko is lying to the trial… in telephone conversations with [[Medvedev, Dmitry|Medvedev]], Yushchenko assured that he fully trusted Yulia Tymoshenko and that she was given the whole scope of necessary authorities and he was in support of the agreements concluded with Russia".<ref name=vret>{{cite web|url=http://www.pravda.com.ua/rus/news/2011/08/17/6503251/ |title=Representative of Kremlin blamed Yushchenko in lies.

The "Koretzky Institution of State and Law" is an expert organization in Ukraine; the General Procurator's Office of Ukraine involved the Institution specialists as experts yet at the investigation stage of the gas case.

On the 15th of August, 2011, Deputy Director of the Institution Vladimir Nagrebelny presented to the trial an expert conclusion according to which Tymoshenko did not exceed her office authorities in the course of gas talks with Russia:

Fifteen (60%) of the convicted were given a probation, while another nine were completely pardoned either due to amnesty or other issues.
