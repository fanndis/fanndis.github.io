Formerly known as '''Longacre Square''', Times Square was renamed in 1904 after ''[[The New York Times]]'' moved its headquarters to the then newly erected Times Building, now [[One Times Square]].

Times Square functions as a [[town square]], but is not geometrically a [[square]]; it is closer in shape to a bowtie, with two triangles emanating roughly north and south from 45th Street,<ref>[http://blogs.cuit.columbia.edu/urbanmagazine/2011/05/09/times-square-is-not-a-square/ "Times Square is not a square,"] ''Urban Magazine'' (May 9, 2011).</ref> where [[Seventh Avenue (Manhattan)|Seventh Avenue]] intersects [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]].

===Early history===
When [[Manhattan]] Island was first settled by the Dutch, three small streams united near what is now 10th Avenue and 40th Street. These three streams formed the "Great Kill" (Dutch: ''Grote Kil''). From there the Great Kill wound through the low-lying Reed Valley, known for fish and waterfowl<ref>[[Gerard T. Koeppel]], ''Water for Gotham: A History'', 2001:10.</ref> and emptied into a deep bay in the [[Hudson River]] at the present 42nd Street.<ref>Sanderson, Eric W. ''Mannahatta: A Natural History of New York City'', 2009: Appendix A p 253; refs. G.E. Hill and G.E. Waring Jr, "Old wells and water-courses on the isle of Manhattan", in ''Historic New York'', M.W. Goodwin, A.C. Royce, and R. Putnam, 1897; and others.</ref> The name was retained in a tiny hamlet, Great Kill, that became a center for carriage-making, as the upland to the south and east became known as Longacre.<ref>Edwin G. Burrows and Mike Wallace, ''Gotham: A History of New York City to 1898'', 1999, p.721.</ref>

Before and after the [[American Revolution]], the area belonged to [[John Morin Scott]], a general of the [[New York militia]], in which he served under [[George Washington]]. Scott's [[manor house]] was at what is currently 43rd Street, surrounded by countryside used for farming and breeding horses. In the first half of the 19th century, it became one of the prized possessions of [[John Jacob Astor]], who made a second fortune selling off lots to hotels and other real estate concerns as the city rapidly spread [[Upper Manhattan|uptown]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Ulam |first=Alex |url=http://therealdeal.com/newyork/articles/john-jacob-astor-the-making-of-a-hardnosed-speculator |title=John Jacob Astor: The making of a hardnosed speculator &#124; The Real Deal &#124; New York Real Estate News |publisher=The Real Deal |date=June 2, 2008 |accessdate=April 21, 2010}}</ref>

By 1872, the area had become the center of New York's horse carriage industry. The locality had not previously been given a name, and city authorities called it Longacre Square after [[Long Acre]] in London, where the horse and carriage trade was centered in that city.<ref>Kelly, Frank Bergen.

As more profitable commerce and industrialization of [[Lower Manhattan]] pushed homes, theaters, and prostitution northward from the [[Tenderloin, Manhattan|Tenderloin District]], Longacre Square became nicknamed the ''Thieves Lair'' for its rollicking reputation as a low entertainment district. The first theater on the square, the [[Olympia Theatre (New York City)|Olympia]], was built by cigar manufacturer and [[impresario]] [[Oscar Hammerstein I]].<ref>Dunning, Jennifer.

Accessed November 1, 2016. "The old stock and repertory company system made way for the Broadway hit and greater profits for the theater manager and owner, which, in turn, led to the rise of such theatrical entrepreneurs as Oscar Hammerstein, who struck out into the wilds of 44th and 45th Streets in 1895 to build his huge Olympia Theater in the 'Thieves Lair' area of Broadway."</ref> According to ''Gotham: A History of New York City to 1898'', "By the early 1890s this once sparsely settled stretch of Broadway was ablaze with electric light and thronged by crowds of middle- and upper-class theatre, restaurant and cafe patrons."<ref>Burrows and Wallace 1999:1149.</ref>

In 1904, ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' publisher [[Adolph Ochs|Adolph S. Ochs]] moved the newspaper's operations to a new skyscraper on 42nd Street at Longacre Square, on the site of the former [[Pabst Hotel]], which had existed on the site for less than a decade since it opened in November 1899.<ref>[[Christopher Gray|Gray, Christopher.]] [https://www.nytimes.com/1996/12/01/realestate/a-small-hotel-a-mock-battleship-and-the-titanic.html "Streetscapes: A Small Hotel, a Mock Battleship and the Titanic"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', December 1, 1996.

In 1913, the [[Lincoln Highway Association]], headed by entrepreneur [[Carl G.

This was the first road across the United States, which originally spanned {{convert|3389|mi|km}} coast-to-coast through 13 states to its western terminus in [[Lincoln Park (San Francisco)|Lincoln Park]] in San Francisco, California.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hmdb.org/marker.asp?marker=18026 |title=The Lincoln Highway Marker |publisher=Hmdb.org |accessdate=April 21, 2010}}</ref><ref>Pollak, Michael.

Entertainment icons such as [[Irving Berlin]], [[Charlie Chaplin]], and [[Fred Astaire]] were closely associated with Times Square in the 1910s, 1920s, and 1930s. However, it was also during this period that the area began to be besieged by crime and corruption, in the form of gambling and prostitution; one case that garnered huge attention was the arrest and subsequent execution of police officer [[Charles Becker]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/gangsters_outlaws/cops_others/becker/2.html |title=Killer Cop: Charles Becker – Crime Library on |publisher=Trutv.com |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212212812/http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/gangsters_outlaws/cops_others/becker/2.html|archive-date=December 12, 2013 |accessdate=April 21, 2010}}</ref>

From the 1960s to the early 1990s, the seediness of the area, especially due to its [[go-go bar]]s, [[sex shop]]s, [[peep show]]s and adult theaters, became an infamous symbol of the city's decline.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.streetdirectory.com/travel_guide/207131/new_york_guide/times_square_new_york_city.html |title=Times Square New York City |publisher=Streetdirectory.com |accessdate=April 21, 2010}}</ref>

As early as 1960, 42nd Street between Seventh and Eighth Avenue was described by ''[[The New York Times]]'' as "the 'worst' [block] in town".<ref name="bracker">Milton Bracker, "Life on W. 42nd St. a study in decay," New York Times, March 14, 1960, at 1, 26.</ref> Later that decade, Times Square was depicted in ''[[Midnight Cowboy]]'' as gritty, dark and desperate, and conditions only worsened in the 1970s and 1980s, as did the [[Crime in New York City|crime]] in the rest of the city. By 1984, an unprecedented 2,300 annual crimes occurred on that single block, of which 460 were serious felonies such as murder and rape.

At the time, police morale was low and petty criminals who committed misdemeanors were not being arrested. [[William Bratton]], who was appointed [[New York City Police Commissioner]] in 1994 and again in 2014, stated, "The [NYPD] didn't want high performance; it wanted to stay out of trouble, to avoid corruption scandals and conflicts in the community. For years, therefore, the key to career success in the NYPD, as in many bureaucratic leviathans, was to shun risk and avoid failure. Accordingly, cops became more cautious as they rose in rank, right up to the highest levels."<ref>William J. Bratton and William Andrews, "What we've learned about policing," ''City Journal'', Spring 1999, available at http://www.city-journal.org/html/9_2_what_weve_learned.html (accessed February 3, 2009).</ref> The city government did not implement [[broken windows theory]] at first, and the allowance of low-profile crime was thought by some at the time to have caused more high-profile crimes to occur.<ref>George L. Kelling and James Q. Wilson, "Broken Windows," ''The Atlantic'', March 1982, available at https://www.theatlantic.com/doc/198203/broken-windows (accessed February 3, 2009).</ref> Formerly elegant movie theaters began to show [[porn]], and [[Male prostitution|hustlers]] were common.<ref>Traub, James. ''The Devil's Playground: A Century of Pleasure and Profit in Times Square'', New York: Random House, 2004. {{ISBN|0375759786}}.</ref> The area was so abandoned at one point during the time that the entire Times Square area paid the city only $6&nbsp;million in property taxes, which is less than what a medium-sized office building in Manhattan typically would produce in tax revenue today in 1984 dollars.

In the 1980s, a commercial building boom began in the western parts of Midtown as part of a long-term [[development plan]] developed under Mayors [[Ed Koch]] and [[David Dinkins]].

===1990s===
In 1990, the [[New York (state)|State of New York]] took possession of six of the nine historic theatres on 42nd Street, and the [[New 42nd Street]] [[non-profit organization]] was appointed to oversee their restoration and maintenance. The theatres underwent renovation for Broadway shows, conversion for commercial purposes, or demolition.<ref name="nyt20150107"/>

In 1992, the Times Square Alliance (formerly the Times Square [[Business Improvement District]], or "BID" for short), a coalition of city government and local businesses dedicated to improving the quality of commerce and cleanliness in the district, started operations in the area.<ref>[http://www.timessquarenyc.org/about_us/info_center.html Times Square Alliance] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100304132155/http://www.timessquarenyc.org/about_us/info_center.html |date=March 4, 2010 }} Tourist information center in former Embassy Theater</ref>

In the mid-1990s, Mayor [[Rudolph Giuliani]] led an effort to clean up the area, an effort that is described by Steve Macek in ''Urban Nightmares: The Media, the Right, and the Moral Panic Over the City'': Security was increased, pornographic theatres were closed, and "undesirable" low-rent residents were pressured to relocate, and then more tourist-friendly attractions and upscale establishments were opened. Advocates of the [[remodeling]] claim that the neighborhood is safer and cleaner. Detractors have countered that the changes have homogenized or [[Disneyfication|"Disneyfied"]] the character of Times Square and have unfairly targeted lower-income New Yorkers from nearby neighborhoods such as [[Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan|Hell's Kitchen]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Macek |first=Steve |title=Urban Nightmares: The Media, the Right, And the Moral Panic Over the City |location=Minneapolis |publisher=University of Minnesota Press |date=2006 |isbn=9780816643608 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NzfLbx1rkxoC&pg=PA111 |page=111 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Rofes |first=Eric E. |url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/glq/summary/v007/7.1rofes.html |title=Imperial New York: Destruction and Disneyfication under Emperor Giuliani.

As part of a contract with Disney, officials from the city and state evicted the pornographic theaters and contracted with [[Madame Tussauds]] and [[AMC Theatres]] to move onto 42nd Street. This spurred the construction of new office towers, hotels, and tourist attractions in the area.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/04/05/nyregion/disney-wished-upon-times-sq-and-rescued-a-stalled-dream.html|title=Disney Wished Upon Times Sq. and Rescued a Stalled Dream|last1=Bagli|first1=Charles V.|date=April 5, 1998|work=The New York Times|access-date=May 15, 2017|last2=Kennedy|first2=Randy|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>{{clear left}}

Times Square now boasts attractions such as [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s [[Times Square Studios]], where ''[[Good Morning America]]'' is broadcast live; competing [[The Hershey Company|Hershey's]] and [[M&M's]] stores across the street from each other; and multiple multiplex movie theaters. Additionally, the area contains restaurants such as Ruby Foo's, a [[Chinese food|Chinese]] eatery; the [[Bubba Gump Shrimp Company]], a [[seafood]] establishment; [[Planet Hollywood|Planet Hollywood Restaurant and Bar]], a [[theme restaurant]]; and Carmine's, serving [[Italian cuisine]]. It has also attracted a number of large financial, publishing, and media firms to set up headquarters in the area. A larger presence of police has improved the safety of the area.<ref name="nyt20150107"/>

The theatres of Broadway and the huge number of animated [[neon sign|neon]] and [[LED]] signs have been one of New York's iconic images as well as a symbol of the intensely urban aspects of Manhattan. Such signage is mandated by [[zoning ordinance]]s that require building owners to display illuminated signs, the only district in New York City with this requirement.<ref>{{cite news | last = Oser | first = Alan S. | title = Great White Way; Planning for a Brighter Times Sq. | work = The New York Times | date = December 14, 1986 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1986/12/14/realestate/perspectives-great-white-way-planning-for-a-brighter-times-sq.html | accessdate = August 22, 2009}}</ref> The neighborhood actually has a minimum limit for lighting instead of the standard maximum limit.<ref>[http://www.archdaily.com/241079/architect-robert-a-m-stern-presence-of-the-past/ "Architect Robert A.M.

In 2002, New York City mayor [[Rudy Giuliani]] administered the oath of office to the city's next mayor, [[Michael Bloomberg]], at Times Square after midnight on January 1 as part of the 2001–2002 New Year's celebration. Approximately 500,000 revelers attended.

Times Square started hosting other major annual events in the 2000s. Since 2002, the summer solstice has been marked by "Mind over Madness", a mass yoga event involving up to 15,000 people.

On February 26, 2009, Mayor [[Michael Bloomberg]] announced that traffic lanes along [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]] from [[42nd Street (Manhattan)|42nd Street]] to 47th Street would be de-mapped starting Memorial Day 2009 and transformed into pedestrian plazas as a trial until at least the end of the year. The same was done in [[Herald Square]] from 33rd to 35th Street. The goal was to ease traffic congestion throughout the midtown grid. The results were to be closely monitored to determine if the project was successful and should be extended.<ref>{{cite news | last = Seifman | first = David | title = Broadway Cars Can Take A Walk | work = New York Post | date = February 26, 2009 | url = http://www.nypost.com/seven/02262009/news/regionalnews/broadway_cars_can_take_a_walk_157028.htm | accessdate = August 22, 2009}}</ref> Bloomberg also stated that he believed the street shutdown would make New York more livable by reducing pollution, cutting down on pedestrian-vehicle accidents and helping traffic flow more smoothly.<ref>{{cite news | last1 = Vanderford | first1 = Richard | last2 = Goldsmith | first2 = Samuel | title = Walk, bike or sit, car-free, in Times Square and Herald Square | work = New York Daily News | date = May 25, 2009 | url = http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2009/05/25/2009-05-25_broadway_stroll_walk_bike_or_sit_and_check_email_carfree_in_times__herald_sqs.html | accessdate = August 22, 2009}}</ref>

===New Year's Eve celebrations===

[[File:Times Square ball.jpg|thumb|right|The Times Square Ball in 2007]]

Times Square is the site of the annual New Year's Eve ball drop. About one million revelers crowd Times Square for the New Year's Eve celebrations, more than twice the usual number of visitors the area usually receives daily.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.timessquarenyc.org/nye/nye.html|title=Times Square Alliance – New Year's Eve|website=Timessquarenyc.org|accessdate=April 21, 2010|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130114060259/http://www.timessquarenyc.org/new-years-eve/index.aspx|archive-date=January 14, 2013}}</ref> However, for the millennium celebration on December 31, 1999, published reports stated approximately two million people overflowed Times Square, flowing from 6th Avenue to 8th Avenue and all the way back on Broadway and Seventh Avenues to 59th Street, making it the largest gathering in Times Square since August 1945 during [[Victory over Japan Day|celebrations marking the end of World War II]].<ref>{{cite web |author=www.nyctourist.com |url=http://timessquare.nyctourist.com/ |title=Times Square New York City, New York City Times Square by NYCTourist.com |publisher=Timessquare.nyctourist.com |accessdate=April 21, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100217043448/http://timessquare.nyctourist.com/ |archive-date=February 17, 2010}}</ref>

On December 31, 1907, a ball signifying New Year's Day was first dropped at Times Square,<ref name=TSLNY /> and the Square has held the main New Year's celebration in New York City ever since. On that night, hundreds of thousands of people congregate to watch the [[Waterford Crystal]] ball being lowered on a pole atop the building, marking the start of the new year. It replaced a lavish fireworks display from the top of the building that was held from 1904 to 1906, but stopped by city officials because of the danger of fire. Beginning in 1908, and for more than eighty years thereafter, Times Square sign maker [[Artkraft Strauss]] was responsible for the ball-lowering. During World War II, a minute of silence, followed by a recording of church bells pealing, replaced the ball drop because of wartime blackout restrictions. Today, Countdown Entertainment and One Times Square handle the New Year's Eve event in conjunction with the Times Square Alliance.<ref name=TSLNY />

A new energy-efficient LED ball debuted for the arrival of 2008, which was the centennial of the Times Square ball drop. The 2008–09 ball is larger and has become a permanent installation as a year-round attraction, being used for celebrations on days such as [[Valentine's Day]] and [[Halloween]].<ref name="TSLNY">{{cite web|url=http://www.timessquarenyc.org/nye/nye_ball.html |title=Times Square Alliance – New Year's Eve – About The Ball |publisher=Timessquarenyc.org |date=November 11, 2008 |accessdate=April 21, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111011053316/http://www.timessquarenyc.org/nye/nye_ball.html |archive-date=October 11, 2011 }}</ref>

The [[New York City Department of Sanitation]] estimated that by 8 a.m. on New Year's Day 2014, it had cleared over 50 tons of refuse from the New Year's celebration, using 190 workers from their own crews and the Times Square Alliance.<ref>{{cite news|title=Crews Clean Up Times Square After New Year's Celebration|url=http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2014/01/01/after-party-in-times-square-comes-the-cleanup/|accessdate=December 30, 2014|publisher=CBS New York|date=January 1, 2014}}</ref>

[[File:Times Square looking north from 44th Street.jpeg|thumb|right|Times Square looking north from 44th Street]]
An immediately recognizable location, Times Square has been featured countless times in literature, on television, in films, in video games, and in music videos.

The seediness of the area was featured prominently in such films as ''[[Midnight Cowboy]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onthesetofnewyork.com/midnightcowboy.html|title=Midnight Cowboy Film Locations – On the set of New York.com|work=onthesetofnewyork.com|accessdate=February 14, 2015}}</ref> (1969), ''[[Born to Win]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/06/13/nyregion/times-square-at-100-it-oughta-be-in-pictures.html|title=Times Square at 100; It Outta Be in Pictures|work=The New York Times|accessdate=December 24, 2019}}</ref> (1971), and ''[[Taxi Driver]]'' (1976).<ref>Nigro, Carmen.

Times Square has been fictionally attacked and destroyed in a number of movies, including ''[[Knowing (film)|Knowing]]'', when a [[solar flare]] destroys New York City;<ref name="PopPlaces">Knight, Gladys L.

Films and TV shows have also employed the opposite tactic, depicting the typically bustling area as eerily still, such as in ''[[Vanilla Sky]],''<ref>[http://www.theuncool.com/press/vanilla-sky-entertainment-tonight/ Vanilla Sky – Entertainment Tonight], The Uncool.

Times Square also has featured prominently in video games. For instance, in ''[[Grand Theft Auto IV]]'', a recreation of the Times Square area, referred to in-game as "Star Junction", is included in the game's fictional "[[Liberty City (Grand Theft Auto)|Liberty City]]" setting.<ref name=PopPlaces/> Times Square is also shown in ''[[Battlefield 3]]'', where the final fight with the main antagonist takes place, where the player must stop him from detonating a nuclear bomb in the square; and ''[[Crysis 2]]'', in which player must fight off attacking alien forces in order to assist U.S. Marines in evacuating the area.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQSq4SkN47k Crysis 2 – Mission 14 Power Out</ref>
