'''Removal of Confederate monuments and memorials''' is an ongoing process in the [[United States]] since the 1960s. Many municipalities in the United States have removed monuments and memorials on public property dedicated to the [[Confederate States of America]] (CSA), and some, such as [[Silent Sam]] in North Carolina, have been torn down by protestors. The momentum to remove Confederate memorials increased dramatically following the high-profile incidents including the [[Charleston church shooting]] (2015), the [[Unite the Right rally]] (2017), and the [[killing of George Floyd]] (2020).<ref name="latimes1">{{cite news |url=https://www.latimes.com/nation/nationnow/la-na-nn-jindal-monuments-20150814-story.html |title=Jindal seeks to block illegal removal of Confederate monuments in New Orleans |first=Natalie |last=Schachar |date=August 15, 2015 |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |access-date=August 17, 2017 }}</ref><ref name=Kenning2017>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/08/16/us/confederate-monuments-removed.html |title=Confederate Monuments Are Illegally Coming Down Across the United States |first=Chris |last=Kenning |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=August 15, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-virginia-protests-statues-idUSKCN1AV0XE |title=U.S. cities step up removal of Confederate statues, despite Virginia |date=August 16, 2017 |newspaper=[[Reuters]] }}</ref> The removals have been driven by the belief that the monuments glorify [[white supremacy]], memorialize an unrecognized, treasonous<ref name=NYTTreason>[https://www.nytimes.com/1861/04/21/archives/the-law-of-treason.html The Law of Treason].

The vast majority of these Confederate monuments were built during the era of [[Jim Crow laws]], from 1877 to 1964. Detractors claim that they were not built as memorials but as a means of intimidating African Americans and reaffirming white supremacy after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/2017/08/20/544266880/confederate-statues-were-built-to-further-a-white-supremacist-future |title=Why Were Confederate Monuments Built? : NPR |last=Parks |first=Miles |date=August 20, 2017|publisher=[[NPR]] |language=en |access-date=August 28, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://theweek.com/speedreads/718507/striking-graphic-reveals-construction-confederate-monuments-peaked-during-jim-crow-civil-rights-eras |title=Striking graphic reveals the construction of Confederate monuments peaked during the Jim Crow and civil rights eras |date=August 15, 2017|magazine=[[The Week]] |language=en |access-date=August 28, 2017}}</ref><ref name=SAHUpton>[https://www.sah.org/publications-and-research/sah-blog/sah-blog/2017/09/13/confederate-monuments-and-civic-values-in-the-wake-of-charlottesville Confederate Monuments and Civic Values in the Wake of Charlottesville].

As part of the [[George Floyd protests|protests that followed the killing of George Floyd]] in 2020, there was a new wave of removal of Confederate monuments. An [[Alabama]] law prohibiting the removal of historical monuments was deliberately broken by the mayor of [[Birmingham, Alabama]], the city council of [[Anniston, Alabama]],<ref>{{Cite news|title=Alabama city removes Confederate monument following vote|url=https://sportsgrindentertainment.com/alabama-city-removes-confederate-monument-following-vote/|author=Christine Watkins, Associated Press|website=Sports Grinding Entertainment|date=September 28, 2020|access-date=September 28, 2020}}</ref> and others. The mayor said that the penalty fine was preferable to the unrest that would follow if it were not removed. The [[Governor of North Carolina]] removed, on the grounds of public safety, three Confederate monuments at the [[North Carolina Capitol]] that the legislature had in effect made illegal to remove. The [[U.S. Army]] said it would rename [[Fort Bragg]] and its other military bases named for Confederate generals. The [[U.S. Navy]] and [[U.S. Marines]] prohibited the display of the [[Confederate flag]], even as bumper stickers on private cars on base. A wave of corporate product re-branding has also ensued. The wave of removals also expanded outside the United States to remove of statues in [[England]], [[Belgium]], and [[New Zealand]]. The objects of the protests grew to include statues to people who profited from the [[Atlantic slave trade]], then to abusers of [[indigenous peoples]], and other public art seen as offensive because of [[History of colonialism|European colonialist]] exploitation.

Most of the Confederate monuments concerned were built in periods of racial conflict, such as when [[Jim Crow laws]] were being introduced in the late 19th century and at the start of the 20th century or during the [[Civil Rights Movement]] of the 1950s and 1960s.{{refn|group=note|Graham (2016) "Many of the treasured monuments that seem to offer a connection to the ''post-bellum'' South are actually much later, anachronistic constructions, and they tend to correlate closely with periods of fraught racial relations".<ref name="graham-theatlantic-2016">{{Cite news |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/04/the-stubborn-persistence-of-confederate-monuments/479751/ |title=Why Are There Still So Many Confederate Monuments? |last=Graham |first=David A. |date=April 26, 2016 |newspaper=[[The Atlantic]] |access-date=August 15, 2017 }}</ref>}}{{refn|group=note|Graham (2016) "A timeline of the genesis of the Confederate sites shows two notable spikes.

According to historian Jane Dailey from [[University of Chicago]], in many cases the purpose of the monuments was not to celebrate the past but rather to promote a "[[white supremacy in the United States|white supremacist]] future".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/2017/08/20/544266880/confederate-statues-were-built-to-further-a-white-supremacist-future |title=Confederate Statues Were Built To Further A 'White Supremacist Future' |website=npr.org |access-date=September 23, 2017}}</ref> Another historian, Karyn Cox, from the [[University of North Carolina at Charlotte]], has written that the monuments are "a legacy of the brutally racist Jim Crow era".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/posteverything/wp/2017/08/16/the-whole-point-of-confederate-monuments-is-to-celebrate-white-supremacy/ |title=Analysis – The whole point of Confederate monuments is to celebrate white supremacy |first=Karen L. |last=Cox |date=August 16, 2017 |access-date=September 23, 2017|via=www.washingtonpost.com}}</ref> A historian from the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]], James Leloudis, stated that "The funders and backers of these monuments are very explicit that they are requiring a political education and a legitimacy for the Jim Crow era and the right of white men to rule."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.heraldsun.com/news/local/counties/durham-county/article167619947.html |title=Durham Confederate statue: tribute to dying veterans or political tool of Jim Crow South? |website=heraldsun.com |access-date=September 23, 2017}}</ref>

Adam Goodheart, Civil War author and director of the Starr Center at [[Washington College]], stated in ''[[National Geographic]]'': "They're 20th-century artifacts in the sense that a lot of it had to do with a vision of national unity that embraced Southerners as well as Northerners, but importantly still excluded black people."<ref name="nationalgeographic.com"/>

==Academic commentary==

In an August 2017 statement on the monuments controversy, the [[American Historical Association]] (AHA) said that to remove a monument "is not to erase history, but rather to alter or call attention to a previous interpretation of history." The AHA stated that most monuments were erected "without anything resembling a democratic process," and recommended that it was "time to reconsider these decisions." According to the AHA, most Confederate monuments were erected during the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth century, and this undertaking was "part and parcel of the initiation of legally mandated segregation and widespread disenfranchisement across the South." According to the AHA, memorials to the Confederacy erected during this period "were intended, in part, to obscure the terrorism required to overthrow Reconstruction, and to intimidate African Americans politically and isolate them from the mainstream of public life." A later wave of monument building coincided with the civil rights movement, and according to the AHA "these symbols of white supremacy are still being invoked for similar purposes."<ref>American Historical Association, [https://www.historians.org/news-and-advocacy/statements-and-resolutions-of-support-and-protest/aha-statement-on-confederate-monuments AHA Statement on Confederate Monuments] (August 2017)</ref>

Michael J. McAfee, curator of history at the West Point Museum, said "There are no monuments that mention the name Benedict Arnold. What does this have to do with the Southern monuments honoring the political and military leaders of the Confederacy? They, like Arnold, were traitors. They turned their backs on their nation, their oaths, and the sacrifices of their ancestors in the War for Independence. ... They attempted to destroy their nation to defend chattel slavery and from a sense that as white men they were innately superior to all other races. They fought for white racial supremacy. That is why monuments glorifying them and their cause should be removed. Leave monuments marking their participation on the battlefields of the war, but tear down those that only commemorate the intolerance, violence, and hate that inspired their attempt to destroy the American nation."<ref name="HistoryNetCommentaries">Lesley Gordon, "Empty Pedestals: What Should Be Done with Civic Monuments to the Confederacy and Its Leaders?"

Historian Robert K. Krick stated that "We live in an age riven by shrill and intemperate voices, from all perspectives and on most topics....It is impossible to imagine a United States in the current atmosphere that does not include zealots eager to obliterate any culture not precisely their own, destroying monuments in the fashion of Soviets after a purge, and antiquities in the manner of ISIS. The trend is redolent of the misery that inundated the planet during the aptly named Dark Ages, arising from savages who believed, as a matter of religion in that instance, that anyone with opinions different than their own was not just wrong, but craven and evil, and must be brutalized into conformity.  On the other hand, a generous proportion of the country now, and always, eschews extremism, and embraces tolerance of others' cultures and inheritances and beliefs. Such folk will be society's salvation."<ref>{{cite web|last=OCTOBER 2017|date=July 18, 2017|title=Empty Pedestals: What should be done with civic monuments to the Confederacy and its leaders?|url=https://www.historynet.com/empty-pedestals-civic-monuments-confederacy-leaders.htm|access-date=June 22, 2020|website=HistoryNet – Civil War Times Magazine|language=en-US}}</ref>

According to historian Adam Goodheart, the statues were meant to be symbols of white supremacy and the rallying around them by white supremacists will likely hasten their demise.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/08/16/regime-change-in-charlottesville-215500 |title=Regime Change in Charlottesville|website=politico.com |access-date=August 18, 2017}}</ref> [[Elijah Anderson]], a professor of sociology at [[Yale University]], said the statues "really impacts the psyche of black people."<ref name="ftmunshitrumpsaysitisfoolish"/> [[Harold Holzer]], the director of the [[Roosevelt House Public Policy Institute at Hunter College]], agreed that the statues were designed to belittle African Americans.<ref name="theartnewspaperstoilas">{{cite news|last1=Stoilas |first1=Helen|last2=Stapley-Brown|first2=Victoria |title=Charlottesville riot hastens removal of Confederate monuments throughout the US |url=https://theartnewspaper.com/news/news/charlottesville-riot-hastens-removal-of-confederate-monuments-throughout-the-us/ |access-date=August 17, 2017 |newspaper=The Art Newspaper |date=August 17, 2017}}</ref> [[Dell Upton]], chair of the Department of Art History at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]], wrote that "the monuments were not intended as public art," but rather were installed "as affirmations that the American polity was a white polity," and that because of their explicitly white supremacist intent, their removal from civic spaces was a matter "of justice, equity, and civic values."<ref name=SAHUpton/> In a 1993 book on the issue in Georgia, author Frank McKenney argued otherwise; "These monuments were communal efforts, public art, and social history," he wrote.<ref>{{cite book|last=McKenney|first= Frank M.|title= The Standing Army: History of Georgia's County Confederate Monuments|publisher= WH Wolfe Associates|location= Alpharetta, Georgia|date= 1993| page= ix}}</ref>  Ex-soldiers and politicians had difficult time raising funds to erect monuments so the task mostly fell to the women, the "mothers widows, and orphans, the bereaved fiancees and sisters" of the soldiers who had lost their lives.{{sfn|McKenney|1993|p=1}} Many ladies' memorial associations were formed in the decades following the end of the Civil War, most of them joining the [[United Daughters of the Confederacy]] following its inception in 1894.

Furthermore, Confederate monuments were erected without the consent or even input of Southern African-Americans, who remembered the Civil War far differently, and who had no interest in honoring those who fought to keep them enslaved.<ref name=SAHUpton/> According to Civil War historian Judith Giesberg, professor of history at [[Villanova University]], "White supremacy is really what these statues represent."<ref name=CSM>[https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/2017/0822/Confederate-monuments-What-to-do-with-them Confederate monuments: What to do with them?].

Katrina Dunn Johnson, Curator at South Carolina's Confederate Relic Room and Military Museum, states that "some historians forget that they are studying real people with real emotions.  The wartime death of a son, brother or husband provoked the same emotional reactions as a death would today—sorrow, anger, questioning and the desire for closure.  These Americans were coping with genuine loss.  Such sentiments cannot be underestimated, especially among the generation that endured the hardships of the Confederate War....thousands of families throughout the country were unable to reclaim their soldier's remains—many never learned their loved ones' exact fate on the battlefield or within the prison camps.  The psychological impact of such a devastating loss cannot be underestimated when attempting to understand the primary motivations behind Southern memorialization."<ref>Johnson, Katrina Dunn, ''No Holier Spot of Ground: Confederate Monuments & Cemeteries of South Carolina'', Introduction.[https://books.google.com/books?id=P9t-CQAAQBAJ&pg=PT9&dq=%22primary+motivations+behind+southern+memorialization%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwipm7OnvtbkAhVQY6wKHSy8AhcQ6AEwAHoECAAQAg#v=onepage&q=%22primary%20motivations%20behind%20southern%20memorialization%22&f=false]</ref>

Robert Seigler, in his study of Confederate monuments in South Carolina, found that out of the over one hundred and seventy that he documented, only five monuments were found dedicated to the African Americans who had been used by the Confederacy working "on fortifications, and had served as musicians, teamsters, cooks, servants, and in other capacities." Four of those were to slaves and one to a musician, Henry Brown.<ref>Seigler, Robert S., A Guide to Confederate Monuments in South Carolina: Passing the Cup, South Carolina Department of Archives and History, 1997 p. 10</ref>

[[Eric Foner]], a historian of the Civil War and biographer of [[Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln]], argued that more statues of African Americans like [[Nat Turner]] should be erected.<ref name="ftmunshitrumpsaysitisfoolish">{{cite news|last1=Munshi |first1=Neil |title=Trump says it is 'foolish' to remove Confederate symbols |url=https://www.ft.com/content/e7496854-82a1-11e7-a4ce-15b2513cb3ff |access-date=August 17, 2017 |newspaper=[[Financial Times]] |date=August 17, 2017}}</ref> [[Alfred Brophy]], a professor of law at the University of Alabama, argued the removal of the Confederate statues "facilitates forgetting", although these statues were "re-inscribed images of white supremacy". Brophy also stated that the Lee statue in Charlottesville should be removed.<ref name="ftmunshitrumpsaysitisfoolish" />

Civil War historian [[James I. Robertson Jr.]] said that the monuments were not a "Jim Crow signal of defiance". He called the current climate to dismantle or destroy Confederate monuments as an "age of idiocy", motivated by "elements hell-bent on tearing apart unity that generations of Americans have painfully constructed".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.c-span.org/video/?448679-5/debate-confederate-monuments|title=Debate Over Confederate Monuments &#124; C-SPAN.org|website=www.c-span.org}}</ref> However, Civil War historian [[David Blight]] asked: "Why, in the year [2016], should communal spaces in the South continue to be sullied by tributes to those who defended slavery? How can Americans ignore the pain that black citizens, especially, must feel when they walk by the [John C.] Calhoun monument, or any similar statues, on their way to work, school or Bible study?"<ref>{{cite news
Very respectfully, your obedient servant, R. E. Lee. (Charleston Courier, September 2, 1869)}}</ref>

Julian Hayter, a historian at the University of Richmond, supports a different approach for the statues: re-contextualization. He supports adding a "footnote of epic proportions" such as a prominent historical sign or marker that explains the context in which they were built to help people see old monuments in a new light. "I'm suggesting we use the scale and grandeur of those monuments against themselves. I think we lack imagination when we talk about memorials. It's all or nothin'.... As if there's nothin' in between that we could do to tell a more enriching story about American history.<ref>{{cite web|title=Times Are Changing As Tolerance Weakens For Confederate Monuments|url=https://www.npr.org/2020/06/15/876962140/times-are-changing-as-tolerance-weakens-for-confederate-monuments|access-date=June 22, 2020|website=NPR.org|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The history and future of Confederate monuments – 60 minutes|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/the-history-and-future-of-confederate-monuments/|access-date=June 22, 2020|website=www.cbsnews.com|language=en}}</ref>

In 2019, North Carolina's law prohibiting monument removal was challenged indirectly. The Confederate Soldiers Monument in [[Winston-Salem, North Carolina|Winston-Salem]] was removed as a [[public nuisance]], and a similar monument in [[Pittsboro, North Carolina|Pittsboro]] was removed after a court ruled that it had never become county property, so the statute did not apply.<ref>{{cite news

===Unsuccessful Federal Legislation===

On July 22, 2020, in the midst of the [[George Floyd protests]], the U.S. House of Representatives voted 305-113 to remove a bust of Chief Justice [[Roger B. Taney]] (as well as statues honoring figures who were part of the Confederacy during the Civil War) from the U.S. Capitol and replace it with a bust of Justice [[Thurgood Marshall]]. The bill called for removal of Taney's bust within 30 days after the law's passage. The bust had been mounted in the old robing room adjacent to the [[Old Supreme Court Chamber]] in the [[United States Capitol|Capitol Building]].  The bill (H.R. 7573<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/7573|title=H.R.7573 - To direct the Joint Committee on the Library to replace the bust of Roger Brooke Taney in the Old Supreme Court Chamber of the United States Capitol with a bust of Thurgood Marshall to be obtained by the Joint Committee on the Library and to remove certain statues from areas of the United States Capitol which are accessible to the public, to remove all statues of individuals who voluntarily served the Confederate States of America from display in the United States Capitol, and for other purposes.|date=22 July 2020|website=congress.gov|access-date=2 November 2020}}</ref>) also created a "process to obtain a bust of Marshall ... and place it there within a minimum of two years."<ref>{{cite news|last1=Walsh|first1=Deirdre|title=House Passes Bill Removing Confederate Statues, Other Figures From Capitol|url=https://www.npr.org/2020/07/22/894165717/house-poised-to-pass-bill-removing-confederate-statues-from-capitol|access-date=23 July 2020|publisher=[[NPR]]|date=22 July 2020}}</ref>  After the bill reached the Republican-led Senate on 30 July 2020 (S.4382) it was referred to the [[United States Senate Committee on Rules and Administration|Committee on Rules and Administration]], but no further action on it was taken.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/116/s4382/text|title=S. 4382: A bill to direct the Joint Committee on the Library to replace the bust of Roger Brooke Taney in the Old Supreme Court Chamber of the Capitol with a bust of Thurgood Marshall to be obtained by the Joint Committee on the Library and to remove certain statues from areas of the Capitol which are accessible to the public, to remove all statues of individuals who voluntarily served the Confederate States of America from display in the Capitol, and for other purposes|date=30 July 2020|website=govtrack.us|access-date=2 November 2020}}</ref>

==Protesters==
In North Carolina and Georgia, where removal is completely prohibited, protesters toppled three Confederate monuments: 
* The [[Confederate Soldiers Monument (Durham, North Carolina)|Confederate Soldiers Monument]] in [[Durham, North Carolina]].
* ''[[Silent Sam]]'', in [[Chapel Hill, North Carolina]].
* The [[Screven County, Georgia|Screven County]] Confederate Dead Monument, in [[Sylvania, Georgia]].

Of these, the first and third were damaged to the point that they cannot be repaired. ''Silent Sam'', which was not seriously damaged, is in storage as of June 2020, awaiting a political decision about what to do with it. The "Confederate Dead Monument" was then replaced through funds raised by the [[Sons of Confederate Veterans]] and the [[United Daughters of the Confederacy]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Enoch Autry |url=https://www.augustachronicle.com/news/20191026/screven-county-confederate-monument-rededicated-after-original-toppled |title=Screven County Confederate monument rededicated after original toppled - News - The Augusta Chronicle - Augusta, GA |publisher=The Augusta Chronicle |access-date=July 9, 2020}}</ref>

In addition, the bust of Robert E. Lee in [[Fort Myers, Florida]], was toppled by unknown parties during the night of March 11–12, 2019.

==Threats of violence==
Removal of Confederate monuments in Maryland and New Orleans took place in the middle of the night, with police protection and workers wearing bullet-proof vests, because of concerns about possible violence. In the case of New Orleans, a crane had to be brought in from an unidentified out-of-state company as no local company wanted the business; one local company had a vehicle set ablaze and sand poured in the gas tank of another. (See [[#Louisiana|below]].)

[[Jason Spencer]], a white member of the Georgia legislature, told an African-American colleague that if she continued calling for removal of Confederate monuments that she wouldn't be "met with torches but something a lot more definitive", and that People who want the statues gone "will go missing in the [[Okefenokee]].... Don't say I didn't warn you."<ref>{{cite news

A 2017 [[Reuters]] poll found that 54% of American adults stated that the monuments should remain in all public spaces, and 27% said they should be removed, while 19% said they were unsure.

==Vestigial pedestals==
In the case of many monuments, after they are removed the pedestals or [[plinth]]s remain. What to do with them has been the subject of some discussion. In the case of the toppled ''[[Silent Sam]]'' monument at the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]], two scholars proposed leaving the "empty pedestal — shorn all original images and inscriptions — [which] eliminates the offending tribute while still preserving a record of what these communities did and where they did it.... The most effective way to commemorate the rise and fall of white supremacist monument-building is to preserve unoccupied pedestals as the ruins that they are — broken tributes to a morally bankrupt cause."<ref>{{cite news |first1=Ethan J. |last1=Kytle |first2=Blain |last2=Roberts |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |date=August 22, 2018 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/21/opinion/silent-sam-confederate-monument-north-carolina.html |title=Broken Tributes to a Morally Bankrupt Cause}}</ref>

In Baltimore, one of the four empty plinths was used in 2017, with eventual city tolerance though not approval, for a statue of a pregnant black woman, naked from the waist up, holding a baby in a brightly-covered sling on her back, with a raised golden fist: ''Madre Luz'' (''Mother Light''). The statue was first placed in front of the monument before its removal, then raised to the pedestal. According to the artist Pablo Machioli, "his original idea was to construct a pregnant mother as a symbol of life. 'I feel like people would understand and respect that'". The statue has been vandalized several times.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Someone Toppled the 'Madre Luz' Sculpture that Briefly Replaced Baltimore's Lee-Jackson Monument|first=Ethan|last=McLeod|date=August 17, 2017|magazine=Baltimore Fishbowl|access-date=September 29, 2018|url=https://baltimorefishbowl.com/stories/someone-toppled-the-madre-luz-sculpture-that-briefly-replaced-baltimores-lee-jackson-monument/}}</ref> According to a writer for ''Another Chicago Magazine'' discussing the removal of the Baltimore monuments, she is "defiant....

She is the African seed of the [[Triplochiton scleroxylon|wawa tree]].

At the University of North Carolina–Chapel Hill, the plinth of ''Silent Sam'' and its plaques were removed on January 14, 2019, at the direction of Chancellor [[Carol Folt]] (see below).

** [[Confederate Park (Demopolis, Alabama)|Confederate Park]]. Renamed "Confederate Park" in 1923 at the request of&nbsp;the United Daughters of the Confederacy.
