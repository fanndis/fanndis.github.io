{{PoliticsUK}}
The '''First Lord of the Treasury''' is the head of the [[Government agency|commission]] exercising the ancient office of [[Lord High Treasurer]] in the United Kingdom, and is by convention also the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]]. This office is not equivalent to the usual position of the "[[Finance minister|Treasurer]]" in other governments; the closer equivalent of a Treasurer in the United Kingdom is [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]], who is the Second Lord of the Treasury.

==Lords of the Treasury==
As of the beginning of the 17th century, the running of the [[HM Treasury|Treasury]] was frequently entrusted to a commission, rather than to a single individual. Since 1714, it has permanently been in commission. The commissioners have always since that date been referred to as [[Lords Commissioners of the Treasury]], and adopted [[Ordinal number (linguistics)|ordinal numbers]] to describe their seniority. Eventually in the middle of the same century, the First Lord of the Treasury came to be seen as the natural head of the overall ministry running the country, and, as of the time of [[Robert Walpole]] ([[Whigs (British political party)|Whig]]), began to be known, unofficially, as the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]]. 

The term Prime Minister was initially, but decreasingly, used as a term of derogation; it was first used officially in a royal warrant only in 1905.{{Which|date=May 2020}} [[William Pitt the Younger]] said the Prime Minister "ought to be the person at the head of the finances"—though Pitt also served as Chancellor of the Exchequer for the entirety of his time as Prime Minister, so his linkage of the finance portfolio to the premiership was wider than merely proposing the occupation of the First Lordship by the Prime Minister.{{sfn|Blick|Jones|2010}}

Prior to 1841 the First Lord of the Treasury also held the office of [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] unless he was a peer and thus barred from that office; in this case, the [[Second Lord of the Treasury]] usually served as Chancellor. As of 1841, the Chancellor has always been Second Lord of the Treasury when he was not also Prime Minister. By convention, the other Lords Commissioners of the Treasury are also Government [[Whip (politics)|Whips]] in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]].

==Official residence==
{{Main|10 Downing Street}}
[[10 Downing Street]] is the official residence of the First Lord of the Treasury, not the office of Prime Minister.<ref>{{Citation |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/ministers/first-lord-of-the-treasury|title=First Lord of the Treasury |website=Gov.uk|access-date=2018-03-22 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> [[Chequers]], a [[country house]] in [[Buckinghamshire]], is the official country residence of the Prime Minister, used as a weekend and holiday home, although the residence has also been used by other senior members of government.{{fact|date=February 2019}}

==List of First Lords (1714–1905)==
{{For|earlier Lord Treasurers and First Lords|List of Lord High Treasurers of England and Great Britain}}
Much of this list overlaps with the [[list of Prime Ministers of the United Kingdom|list of prime ministers of the United Kingdom]], but there are some notable differences, principally concerning the [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury|Marquess of Salisbury]], who was Prime Minister but not First Lord in 1885–86, 1887–92 and 1895–1902. Those First Lords who were simultaneously Prime Minister are indicated in '''bold'''; those who were considered Prime Minister only during part of their term are indicated in '''''bold italic'''''.
