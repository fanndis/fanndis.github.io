==History==
Heythrop had a [[Norman architecture|Norman]] [[parish church]] of [[Saint Nicholas]], but the [[nave]] has been demolished and only the [[chancel]] has been preserved as a mortuary chapel. The chapel's west doorway was the south doorway of the former nave.<ref name=Sherwood646>{{harvnb|Sherwood|Pevsner|1974|p=646}}</ref>

In 1657 an attempt to merge the [[Benefice#Church of England|Benefices]] of [[Enstone]] and Heythrop was abandoned in the face of local opposition.<ref name=Crossley>{{harvnb|Crossley|1983|pp=131–143}}</ref> In 1923 the incumbent of Heythrop ceased to live in the parish and in 1964 it and Enstone were finally merged.<ref name=Crossley/> In 2001 the Benefice of [[Enstone]] and Heythrop merged with that of [[Ascott-under-Wychwood]], [[Chadlington]], and [[Spelsbury]] to form the Chase Benefice.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.achurchnearyou.com/church/5892/ |author=[[Archbishops' Council]] |work=[[A Church Near You]] |title=Heythrop: St Nicholas |publisher=[[Church of England]] |accessdate=}}</ref>

[[Heythrop Park|Heythrop House]] in [[Heythrop Park]] was built from 1706 onwards by the architect [[Thomas Archer]] for [[Charles Talbot, 1st Duke of Shrewsbury]]. It was gutted by fire in 1831 and restored to designs by the architect [[Alfred Waterhouse]] in 1871 for Albert Brassey.{{sfn|Sherwood|Pevsner|1974|p=647}} It was a [[Heythrop College|Jesuit college]] from 1922 until 1969{{sfn|Sherwood|Pevsner|1974|p=649}} and a training college for the [[National Westminster Bank]] from 1969 until 1999.

Brassey rebuilt Heythrop as a [[model village]] in the 1870s and 1880s.{{sfn|Rowley|1978|p=137}} He encouraged the growth of the church congregation such that it outgrew its Norman building.<ref name=Crossley/> In 1880 he had a new [[Church of England parish church]] of St. Nicholas built by the [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival architect]] Sir [[Arthur Blomfield]].<ref name=Sherwood646/> The south doorway incorporates 13th century mouldings from the demolished nave of the old church.<ref name=Sherwood646/>

Albert Brassey had the rectory built at about the same time. It remained in the Brasseys' ownership, and when the incumbent ceased to reside in the parish in 1923 it was renamed the Dower House and let as a private house.<ref name=Crossley/>

Former UK Prime Minister [[Theresa May]] was a pupil at Heythrop Primary School.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/in_depth/education/2000/first_day/741078.stm |title=Screaming arrival |publisher=BBC News |date=8 May 2000 |accessdate=24 February 2019}}</ref>
