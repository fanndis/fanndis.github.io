The '''College of Europe''' ({{lang-fr|Collège d'Europe}}) is a postgraduate institute of [[European studies]] with its main campus in [[Bruges]], [[Belgium]], and a smaller campus in [[Warsaw]], Poland. The College of Europe in Bruges was founded in 1949 by leading historical European figures and [[founding fathers of the European Union]], including [[Salvador de Madariaga]], [[Winston Churchill]], [[Paul-Henri Spaak]] and [[Alcide De Gasperi]] as one of the results of the 1948 [[Congress of Europe]] in [[The Hague]] to promote "a spirit of [[solidarity]] and mutual understanding between all the nations of [[Western Europe]] and to provide elite training to individuals who will uphold these values"<ref name="Le rôle du Collège d'Europe">"[http://www.ena.lu/role_college_europe_journal_bruges_province_october_1950-020205225.html Le rôle du Collège d'Europe]" [The role of the College of Europe], ''Journal de Bruges et de la Province'', 7 October 1950, Vol. 114, No. 78, p. 1</ref> and "to train an elite of young executives for Europe".<ref>Henri Brugmans, "[http://www.ena.lu/henri_brugmans_training_executives_europe-020008223.html Former des cadres pour l'Europe]" [Training executives for Europe], ''Fédération'', January 1950, No. 60, pp. 42–44</ref> The founders imagined the college as a place where Europe's future leaders could live and study together. It has the status of "Institution of Public Interest", operating according to Belgian law. The second campus in Natolin (Warsaw), Poland was opened in 1992.<ref name="coleurope1">{{cite web|url=http://www.coleurope.eu/template.asp?pagename=natolinlocation |title=College of Europe – College of Europe – Campuses – Natolin (Warsaw) |publisher=Coleurope.eu |accessdate=2012-06-26}}</ref> The College of Europe is historically linked to the establishment of the European Union and its predecessors, and to the creation of the [[European Movement International]], of which the college is a supporting member. [[Federica Mogherini]], former [[High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy]], was appointed as the Rector to start in September 2020;<ref>[https://www.neweurope.eu/article/former-top-diplomat-mogherini-appointed-as-college-of-europe-rector/ Former top diplomat Mogherini appointed as College of Europe rector]</ref> former President of the European Council [[Herman Van Rompuy|Herman, Count Van Rompuy]] is chairman of the board.<ref name="Rompuy">{{Cite web|url=https://www.coleurope.eu/news/appointment-new-president-administrative-council|title=Appointment of the new President of the Administrative Council|website=coleurope.eu}}</ref>

Students are usually selected in cooperation with their countries' ministries of foreign affairs, and admission is highly competitive. The College of Europe is bilingual, and students must be proficient in English and French. Students receive an advanced master's degree (formerly called Diploma and Certificat) following a one-year programme. Traditionally, students specialise in either [[European Law]], [[international economics|European Economic Studies]], or [[Europe]]an [[Political science|Political]] and [[Public administration|Administrative Studies]]; in recent years, additional programmes have been created. For much of its history the college only admitted a small number of students, although the number has increased since the 1990s.

According to ''[[The Times]]'', the "College of Europe, in the medieval Belgian city of Bruges, is to the European political elite what the [[Harvard Business School]] is to American corporate life. It is a hothouse where the ambitious and talented go to make contacts".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article7107214.ece |title=Which way will Nick Clegg turn? |author=Jonathan Oliver |work=The Times |date=25 April 2010 |accessdate=17 September 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/61lBAejO7?url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article7107214.ece |archivedate=17 September 2011 |url-status=dead}}</ref> ''[[The Economist]]'' describes it as "an elite [[finishing school]] for aspiring Eurocrats".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/2404749 |title=Charlemagne: Free the Strasbourg 626 |work=The Economist |date=5 February 2004 |accessdate=17 September 2011}}</ref> The ''[[Financial Times]]'' writes that "the elite College of Europe in Bruges" is "an institution geared to producing crop after crop of graduates with a lifelong enthusiasm for EU integration".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.ft.com/brusselsblog/2010/04/europe-in-joyous-disbelief-over-nick-clegg-and-the-lib-dems/ |title=Europe in joyous disbelief over Nick Clegg and the Lib Dems |author=Tony Barber |work=Financial Times |date=20 April 2010 |accessdate=17 September 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/61lAwPkXN?url=http://blogs.ft.com/brusselsblog/2010/04/europe-in-joyous-disbelief-over-nick-clegg-and-the-lib-dems/ |archivedate=17 September 2011 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Former European Commissioner for Education [[Ján Figeľ]] described the college as "one of the most emblematic centres of European studies in the European Union".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/commission_barroso/figel/speeches/docs/06_06_23_college_of_europe_en.pdf |title=The Commissioners – Profiles, Portfolios and Homepages |work=Europa (web portal) |accessdate=22 April 2012}}</ref> The [[BBC]] has referred to it as "the EU's very own [[Oxbridge]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-24662050 |title=College of Europe in Bruges: Home of Thatcher speech |author= Adam Fleming |work=BBC |date=25 October 2013 |accessdate=10 July 2015 }}</ref> The college has also been described as "the leading place to study European affairs"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.flanderstoday.eu/content/bruges-mafia |title=The Bruges mafia |author=Nicholas Hirst |publisher=Flanders Today |date=18 October 2011 |accessdate=26 October 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/62k6ur8l5?url=http://www.flanderstoday.eu/content/bruges-mafia |archivedate=27 October 2011 |url-status=dead}}</ref> and as "the elite training center for the European Union's political class".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/regions/europe/110922/Helle-Thorning-Schmidt-gucci-denmark-female-prime-minister |title=Meet 'Gucci Helle,' slated to be Denmark's first female prime minister |author=Richard Orange |publisher=GlobalPost |date=23 September 2011 |accessdate=26 October 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/62mnTSuLM?url=http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/regions/europe/110922/Helle-Thorning-Schmidt-gucci-denmark-female-prime-minister |archivedate=29 October 2011 |url-status=dead}}</ref> [[RFE/RL]] has referred to the college as "a Euro-[[Federalism|federalist]] hot-spot".<ref>{{cite news |url= https://www.rferl.org/a/college_of_europe_breeds_the_new_elite/24374133.html |title= Training The 'New Europeans' – The College of Europe Breeds The EU Elite |author= Rikard Jozwiak |publisher= [[RFE/RL]] |date= 28 October 2011 |accessdate= 12 May 2019}}</ref> ''[[The Global Mail]]'' has described its students as "Europe's leaders-in-waiting".<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.theglobalmail.org/feature/europes-leaders-in-waiting-face-the-mess-ahead/38/ |title= Europe's leaders-in-waiting face the mess ahead |author= Eric Ellis |work= [[The Global Mail]] |date= 7 February 2012 |accessdate= 7 February 2012 |url-status= dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120210103605/http://www.theglobalmail.org/feature/europes-leaders-in-waiting-face-the-mess-ahead/38/ |archivedate= 10 February 2012}}</ref> The well-connected graduates of the college are sometimes referred to as the "Bruges mafia;"<ref>[http://www.flanderstoday.eu/living/bruges-mafia The Bruges mafia]</ref> Schnabel and Rocca note that "many of the most successful Commission staff members are also graduates of the elite College of Europe in Bruges, Belgium, which offers a one-year master's course in European studies, and whose graduates are said to form a 'Bruges Mafia.'"<ref>{{cite book |last1= Schnabel |first1= Rockwell Anthony |last2= Rocca |first2= Francis X. |year= 2005 |title= The next superpower?: the rise of Europe and its challenge to the United States |url= https://archive.org/details/nextsuperpowerri00schn/page/148 |publisher= Rowman & Littlefield |page= [https://archive.org/details/nextsuperpowerri00schn/page/148 148] |isbn= 978-0-7425-4547-2 }}</ref>

Each academic year is named after a patron and referred to as a promotion. The academic year is opened by a leading European politician. The College of Europe shares several traditions with the [[École nationale d'administration]] (ENA) of France,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/opinion/government-by-nerds-one-step-from-tyranny/story-fn4riyly-1226199393019 |title= Government by nerds one step from tyranny |author=Tim Soutphommasane|date=19 November 2011 |work=The Australian |accessdate=20 November 2011|quote=It is no accident that institutes such as the celebrated Ecole Nationale d'Administration in France or the College of Europe in Belgium produce so many political leaders.}}</ref> but has a more European focus. Its alumni include the former Prime Minister of Denmark [[Helle Thorning-Schmidt]], the former Prime Minister of Finland [[Alexander Stubb]], the former British Deputy Prime Minister [[Nick Clegg]] as well as the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Italy [[Enzo Moavero Milanesi]], several of whom have also been professors at the college. Many of its alumni go on to serve as diplomats and senior civil servants in European institutions.

==History==
The College of Europe was the world's first university institute of postgraduate studies and training in European affairs.
It was founded in 1949 by leading European figures, such as [[Salvador de Madariaga]], [[Winston Churchill]], [[Paul-Henri Spaak]] and [[Alcide De Gasperi]], in the wake of the [[Hague Congress (1948)|Hague Congress of 1948]], that led to the creation of the [[European Movement]], and is frequently considered the first federal moment in European history. They imagined a college where Europe's future leaders, some from countries only a short while before at war with each other, could live and study together.<ref name="Le rôle du Collège d'Europe"/> In particular, it was Spanish statesman [[Salvador de Madariaga]] the one who advocated for the creation of a College of Europe, where graduates from different European states could study together, as a way to heal the wounds of the [[World War II]]. Although the cultural resolution adopted at the end of the Congress did not include explicit references to the establishment of a College of Europe and only advocated for the creation of a 'European Cultural Centre and a European Institute for Childhood and Youth Questions', the idea of establishing a European University was put forward by Congress attendees immediately after the Congress.<ref>{{cite web |title=The College of Europe |url=https://www.cvce.eu/en/recherche/unit-content/-/unit/04bfa990-86bc-402f-a633-11f39c9247c4/e75dcf0a-a6d5-4fef-8de5-fd437a56af9e |website=cvce.eu |publisher=University of Luxembourg.

A group of [[Bruges]] citizens led by the Reverend [[Karel Verleye]] succeeded in attracting the college to Bruges. Professor [[Hendrik Brugmans]], one of the intellectual leaders of the [[European Movement]] and the President of the [[Union of European Federalists]], became its first Rector (1950–1972).<ref>{{cite web |title=Hendrik BRUGMANS † (1950-1972) |url=https://www.coleurope.eu/website/about-college/history/rectors/hendrik-brugmans-1950-1972 |website=coleurope.eu |publisher=College of Europe |accessdate=12 May 2019}}</ref> John Bowie, Professor of Modern History at [[Oxford University]], was appointed Director of the first session held by the college, in 1949.<ref name="The College of Europe">{{cite web |title=The College of Europe |url=https://www.cvce.eu/en/recherche/unit-content/-/unit/04bfa990-86bc-402f-a633-11f39c9247c4/e75dcf0a-a6d5-4fef-8de5-fd437a56af9e |website=cvce.eu |publisher=University of Luxembourg, CVCE |accessdate=21 November 2019}}</ref> Henri van Effenterre, who was a Professor of Ancient History at Caen University and Alphonse de Vreese, International Law professor at the University of Ghent, also contributed to that first session, who was celebrated at the Gothic Chamber of Bruges Town Hall.<ref name="The College of Europe"/> The topic of that first session taught to the first promotion of the college (frequently called préparatoire, for it is the only promotion not named after any prominent figure) was 'Teaching history and the development of a European spirit in universities'.<ref>{{cite web |title=The College of Europe |url=https://www.cvce.eu/en/recherche/unit-content/-/unit/04bfa990-86bc-402f-a633-11f39c9247c4/e75dcf0a-a6d5-4fef-8de5-fd437a56af9e |website=cvce.eu |publisher=University of Luxembourg, CVCE}}</ref>

In the decades that followed the establishment of the institution students were hosted at the Navarre Hotel in the historic center of Bruges until 1981.<ref>{{cite web |title=RICHE HISTOIRE DE L'HÔTEL NAVARRA BRUGES |url=https://www.hotelnavarra.com/documentenv2/Histoire.pdf |website=hotelnavarra.com |publisher=Hotel Navarra Brugge |accessdate=20 November 2019}}</ref> During those first decades of existence the number of postgraduate students was small, though it was increased progressively (from 22 students in 1949 to almost 140 in 1980). The number of enrolled students has increased significantly since the 1980s.<ref>"The College of Europe: Fifty Years of Service to Europe", p78. Accessed on https://www.coleurope.eu/node/2009</ref> Meanwhile, the College consolidated itself as an institution specialized in studies focused on the newly established European Communities (the college was founded in 1949, before the communities were established).

[[File:Salvador de Madariaga.JPG|x220px|thumb|left|[[Salvador de Madariaga]]]]

In 1988, British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher delivered her famous 'Bruges speech' at the College of Europe,<ref name="Margaret Thatcher Foundation">{{cite web |title=Speech to the College of Europe ("The Bruges Speech") |url=https://www.margaretthatcher.org/document/107332 |website=Margaret Thatcher Foundation |publisher=Margaret Thatcher Foundation |accessdate=20 November 2019}}</ref> as part of the opening ceremony for that academic year. In her speech, which has been considered by many the cornerstone of the eurosceptic movement that eventually led to Brexit,<ref>{{cite news |title=How Thatcher's Bruges speech put Britain on the road to Brexit |url=https://www.ft.com/content/0b0afe92-ac40-11e8-8253-48106866cd8a |accessdate=20 November 2019 |work=Financial Times|date=31 August 2018}}</ref> Thatcher laid down her vision for Europe, claiming that the European Community should remain an economic union, refusing the claims for a closer political integration made by Commission President [[Jacques Delors]]. As a part of her speech, Ms. Thatcher also referred to the College as an institution that 'plays a vital and increasingly important part in the life of the European Community'.<ref name="Margaret Thatcher Foundation"/>

After the fall of communism, and in the wake of the changes in [[Central and Eastern Europe]], the College of Europe campus at [[Natolin]] ([[Warsaw]], Poland), was founded in 1992 with the support of the European Commission and the Polish government. The Natolin Campus is located in historic palace, part of a 120-hectare park and nature reserve.<ref name="Welcome to Natolin">{{cite web |title=Welcome to Natolin |url=https://www.coleurope.eu/about-college/welcome-natolin |website=coleurope.eu |publisher=College of Europe |accessdate=20 November 2019}}</ref> According to former President of the European Commission Jacques Delors, "this College of Europe at Natolin is more than the symbol of Europe found once again, it is the hope represented in this beautiful historic place. The hope that exchanges can multiply for greater mutual understanding and fraternity".<ref name="Welcome to Natolin"/> The establishment of a second campus in eastern has been frequently regarded as part of an effort aiming to train young students from eastern countries under the auspices of eastern enlargement.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Poole |first1=Peter A. |title=Europe Unites: The EU's Eastern Enlargement |date=2003 |publisher=Praeger |location=Westport, CT 06881 |isbn=0-275-97704-8 |page=[https://archive.org/details/europeuniteseuse0000pool/page/63 63] |url=https://archive.org/details/europeuniteseuse0000pool |url-access=registration |accessdate=20 November 2019}}</ref> Since the establishment of that second campus in Poland, the college operates as 'one College – two campuses,' and what was once referred to as the '{{lang|fr|esprit de Bruges}}', is now known as the '{{lang|fr|esprit du Collège}}'.

In 1998, former students of the college set up the [[Madariaga – College of Europe Foundation]], which is presided over by Pierre Defraigne.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.coleurope.eu/page-ref/madariaga-college-europe-centre|title=The Madariaga – College of Europe Centre - College of Europe|website=coleurope.eu}}</ref> The foundation has among its objectives 'working to promote citizen's ownership of the European democratic space', as well as promoting 'European responses' for contemporary challenges.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Madariaga – College of Europe Centre |url=https://www.coleurope.eu/page-ref/madariaga-college-europe-centre |website=coleurope.eu |publisher=College of Europe |accessdate=21 November 2019}}</ref> The name choice when the foundation was established was not casual: [[Salvador de Madariaga]] is regarded as the main founder of the college. A bust of him presides over the College library, and one of the halls in Garenmarkt is named after him.

[[File:Prinses Beatrix in Brugge, eerste steen gelegd voor de bibliotheek Europacollege, Bestanddeelnr 917-8423.jpg|thumb|Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands visiting the College in 1965]]

The College of Europe originally had no permanent teaching staff; the courses were taught by prominent academics and sometimes government officials from around Europe.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Jozwiak |first1=Rikard |title=Training The 'New Europeans' -- The College of Europe Breeds The EU Elite |url=https://www.rferl.org/a/college_of_europe_breeds_the_new_elite/24374133.html |publisher=Radio Free Europe Radio Liberty |accessdate=12 May 2019}}</ref> Especially in the last couple of decades, the college has increasingly employed professors and other teaching staff on a permanent basis.

In 2012 the College of Europe became a supporting member of the [[European Movement International]], which noted that the European Movement is "closely linked to the creation of the College of Europe".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://europeanmovement.eu/news/emi-board-approves-new-membership-applications/|title=EMI Board approves new Membership applications|website=EMI}}</ref> The academic year 2018-2019 marked the first time in which a promotion was named after a College alumnus, [[Manuel Marín]], Spanish Statesman, EU Commissioner and acting President of the Commission (known as the 'father of the Erasmus Programme'), who had passed away early that year. In 2015, three years before the election of Marín as ''Patron'', former Finish Prime Minister [[Alexander Stubb]] was the first College alumnus to be invited to be the ''Orateur'' at the opening ceremony of that academic year.

Former Spanish Minister and Cabinet Spokesperson [[Íñigo Méndez de Vigo]], 9th Baron of Claret, served as chairman of the board from 2009 to 2019; in 2019 former Prime Minister of Belgium and President of the European Council [[Herman Van Rompuy|Herman, Count Van Rompuy]] was appointed the new chairman of the board.<ref name="Rompuy" /> In May 2020 Federica Mogherini, former  High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and Vice-President of the European Commission, was appointed rector of the College, the first high ranking political figure from the European Commission to hold the post.<ref>{{cite web |last1=de la Baüme |first1=Maia |title=Mogherini approved as College of Europe rector |url=https://www.politico.eu/article/federica-mogherini-approved-as-college-of-europe-rector/ |website=politico.eu |publisher=Politico Europe |accessdate=26 June 2020}}</ref>

===Traditions===

Throughout its seven decades of history, the College of Europe has developed many different traditions. Some are shared with the [[École nationale d'administration]] (both the College and the École name their promotions after a historical figure, being in the College of Europe an outstanding European figure, which is called 'patron'<ref>{{cite web |title=Promotions and Patrons |url=https://www.coleurope.eu/about-college/history/promotions-and-patrons |website=coleurope.eu |publisher=College of Europe |accessdate=26 November 2019}}</ref>). Besides the choice of a prominent historical figure to name each promotion, each academical year is traditionally inaugurated by a prominent European figure. Furthermore, each year, College of Europe students are named honorary citizens of Bruges prior to their departure,<ref>{{cite web |title=onorary citizens of the city of Bruges |url=https://www.coleurope.eu/events/honorary-citizens-city-bruges |website=coleurope.eu |publisher=College of Europe |accessdate=26 November 2019}}</ref> in an enduring display of the close ties existing between the College and the city that hosted it more than seventy years ago. Another trading dating back to the first years of existence of the college is the visit to Flanders fields during the first weeks of the academic year: incoming students are shown the battlefields and graveyards of [[World War I]] so as to understand the way in which the bloody conflicts of the 20th Century paved the way for European integration. During that visit, students lay a floral tribute at the [[Menin Gate]] war memorial in [[Ypres]].<ref>{{cite web |title=In Flanders Fields - historical study trip |url=https://www.coleurope.eu/events/flanders-fields-historical-study-trip |website=coleurope.eu |publisher=College of Europe |accessdate=26 November 2019}}</ref>

Regarding student life, many traditions have been developed throughout the years. During Christmas, a Christmas tree is placed in each student residence, and students compete by trying to steal and bring to their own residences as much Christmas trees as possible. Another traditional celebration during the academic year is the boat race in the canals of Bruges, frequently held in June. All residences build their own amateur boats, which are manned by College students. Last, since 2010 the Hendrik Brugmans Cup, an annual football tournament, is held by College students. Football teams from both students and alumni participate, each representing a promotion. The tournament is named after [[Hendrik Brugmans]], first rector of the college.

==Campuses==

===Bruges campus===
[[File:College of Europe.jpg|thumb|Paul Henri Spaak Building]]

The Bruges campus is situated in the centre of [[Bruges]] since its establishment in 1949, which was appointed [[European Capital of Culture]] in 2002. Bruges is located in the [[Flemish Region]] of [[Belgium]], a [[Dutch language|Dutch]]-speaking area, although the college does not use Dutch as one of its working languages.

It consists of the following campus buildings:

====Dijver====

The [[Paul Henri Spaak]] Building (named after the renowned Belgian socialist politician, and popularly known as Dijver) is college's main administrative building on the Bruges campus.  It hosts the college's main reception, some of its offices, classrooms and the library. Located on one side of the Dijver Canal, a white classic façade stands at the front of the main building (where the European, Belgian, Flemish and Brugeois flags hang together), while there is a garden in its back side. The garden is used by the students, who frequently spare their break time there due to its proximity to the library (which is connected to the main building by a corridor). Signed portraits of all the orateurs hang in the walls of the main corridor of the building.

[[File:Prinses Beatrix in Brugge, eerste steen gelegd voor de bibliotheek Europacollege, Bestanddeelnr 917-8422.jpg|thumb|left|Princess Beatrix of the Netherlands laying down the first stone of the library in 1965]]

The library building was built in 1965. Princess Beatrix of the Netherlands (later Queen Beatrix) laid the first stone of the library in a special commemorative event. Almost three decades after its completion, the library was reformed and enlarged (the works were completed in 1992). Most of the library fonds are devoted to European Studies, together with law, economics, and political and administrative sciences.<ref>{{cite web |title=College Libraries |url=https://www.coleurope.eu/research/college-libraries |website=coleurope.eu |publisher=College of Europe}}</ref> Access to the library is restricted to College students and academic staff. A bust of Salvador de Madariaga presides over the library main reading hall.

====Verversdijk====

Following the increase in the number of students attending the College each year, the College of Europe (with the support of different entities and institutions, including the Flemish Government and the City of Bruges<ref>{{cite web |title=The Verversdijk extension |url=https://www.coleurope.eu/about-college/bruges/campus/verversdijk-extension |website=coleurope.eu |publisher=College of Europe |accessdate=10 May 2020}}</ref>) reformed the 17th century protected monument<ref name="Jezuïetencollege">{{cite web |title=Jezuïetencollege |url=https://inventaris.onroerenderfgoed.be/erfgoedobjecten/29867 |website=inventaris.onroerenderfgoed.be |publisher=Inventaris Vlaanderen |accessdate=11 May 2020}}</ref> of Verversdijk to provide additional auditoria, teaching rooms and offices for academics, research fellows and staff; and to extend its activities.

Besides its academic and administrative use throughout the course, a cocktail is served in its garden to each promotion, following their graduation ceremony at [[St. Walburga Church| St. Walburga Church (Bruges)]].

The historical site of Verversdijk owes its name to fact that the owners of the houses standing there at medieval times were dyers who used wool traded with Scotland, as the area was populated by several Englishmen during the Middle Ages.<ref>{{cite web |title=Verversdijk |url=https://www.thedoghousebruges.co.uk/live-like-a-local |website=thedoghousebruges.co.uk |publisher=The Doghouse |accessdate=11 May 2020}}</ref> During the Spanish rule, it hosted the schooling houses and the monastery established by the [[Jesuits]] in the 17th century.<ref>{{cite web |title=De Molenbrug: in het midden van verschillende werelden |url=https://www.erfgoedcelbrugge.be/images/filelib/LangestraatHoogstraat_322.pdf |website=erfgoedcelbrugge.be |publisher=Erfgoed Brugge |accessdate=11 May 2020}}</ref> In 1792, the monastery auditorium was used as a meeting place by the Jacobin Club.<ref name="Jezuïetencollege"/> The main monastery wing (dating back to 1701, and whose façade was plastered in 1865<ref name="College of Europe">{{cite web |title=Verversdijk.

====Garenmarkt====
The Hotel Portinari in Garenmarkt 15 with its classical façade was formerly home to [[Tommaso Portinari]], the administrator of the Florentine "Loggia de Medici" in the 15th century in Bruges. It contains eleven apartments for professors and forty student rooms, two "salons" in 19th-century style, the "salon du Recteur" with 18th-century wall paintings and a modern "Mensa" for students.

====Residences====
The college has a system of residences in the centre of Bruges and not far from the Dijver where the main administrative and academic building and the library are situated. None of the residences lodges more than 60 students so that each residence in fact has its own small multinational and multicultural environment.<ref>{{cite web |title=Residences |url=https://www.coleurope.eu/about-college/bruges/residences |website=coleurope.eu |publisher=College of Europe |accessdate=11 May 2020}}</ref>

===Natolin campus===
[[File:Palac Potockich w Natolinie 01.jpg|thumb|Potocki Palace in [[Natolin]]]]

The [[Natolin]] [[Warsaw]] campus of the college was established in 1992 in response to the revolutions of 1989 and in anticipation of the European Union's enlargement.

Today, the Natolin campus is part of a 120-hectare historical park and nature reserve—formerly the Royal hunting palace of [[Natolin]]—situated in the southern part of Warsaw about 20 minutes by metro from the city centre. The Natolin European Centre Foundation takes care of the complex and has conducted restoration of the former Potocki palace, making it available for the college.

The old historical buildings, including the manor house, the stables and the coach house, were converted to the needs of modern times and new buildings were constructed in a style keeping with the harmony of the palace and its outlying park.

== Academics ==

{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2019}}

=== Research ===
The College houses several academic chairs as well as the Global Competition Law Centre. It publishes several books every year, four series of [[working paper]]s and an [[academic journal]] called ''Collegium'', devoted to the European integration process.

==== Cooperation ====
Since the early 1980s, the college has developed a relevant consultancy activity, especially in the field of analysis of [[European Union law|EC law]]. Based on the college's first experiences with service contracts, notably in the field of codification of European Law and related to the implementation of the Internal Market, the Development Office was created to participate in tender procedures and to manage the teams of researchers working under these service contracts.

Over the past 10 years, the College of Europe has been organising cooperation projects funded by various EU programmes, either in consortia with academic partners, companies and law firms, or on its own account. Under [[TEMPUS]] programmes, projects for curriculum building in European Studies were set up. With the EU's [[PHARE]], [[TACIS]] and [[CARDS]] funding the College provided professional training and consultancy in EU affairs in nearly all applicant countries, in [[Russia]] and in the [[Commonwealth of Independent States|CIS]]. In addition the Office has also involved the college in similar co-operation projects in the framework of the MED-CAMPUS Programme and more recently with [[EuropeAid]] funding in Latin America and Asia. The Development Office is now involved in professional training projects and European Studies programmes held in Europe and abroad.

The college has started to organise professional training courses and seminars on [[European integration]] issues with partners such as professional, trade and other associations, private companies and administrations. Officials from the European institutions and national administrations have attended tailor-made training programmes.

==== Conferences ====
International conferences have been held at the College since it was founded. These events have become fora for informed discussion on topics that are complementary to the academic expertise of the college, like the annual conference on Humanitarian Law, organised in cooperation with the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]]. It is also common to have several European prime ministers deliver a speech during the academic year.

=== Courses ===
The one-year programme lasts from September until the end of June and is taught in English and French. It includes lectures, research seminars, workshops and meetings with external specialists and various language courses. To be awarded the degree, students must take oral and written examinations at the end of each semester, and submit a 15 [[European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System|ECTS]] master's thesis in English or French. The thesis gives students the opportunity to undertake individual research, conducted primarily in the second semester, under the supervision of a faculty member. The programmes are enriched by study trips to the European institutions and, for students at Natolin (Warsaw), also to neighbouring countries. Due to the college's extensive network of contacts, students have the opportunity to meet and discuss with policy-makers, practitioners and representatives of the business community throughout their year at the college.

From 1949 to the 1990s, students in Bruges enrolled in three programmes:
*European Economic Studies (i.e., studies of [[international economics]] with an emphasis on the EU)
*European Legal Studies (i.e., studies of [[European law]])
*European Political and Governance Studies (i.e., studies of [[political science]] and [[public administration]] focusing on the EU)

In recent years, other programmes have been created:
*European International Relations and Diplomacy Studies

At [[Natolin]] ([[Warsaw]]) campus, the study programme European Interdisciplinary Studies offers four majors: EU Public Affairs and Policies, The EU in the World, The EU and its Neighbours and European History and Civilisation.

The academic programmes of the College of Europe are accredited by the Dutch-Flemish Accreditation Organisation (NVAO). Each study programme corresponds to a total of 66 credits (ECTS).

Annual intakes are highly selective and student selection takes place in the Spring, usually in association with the [[Foreign affairs ministry|foreign affairs ministries]] of their respective countries of origin. The offered academic programmes typically require a university degree in economics, law, political science or international relations plus advanced knowledge of the working languages of the college.

=== Admissions ===
Application may be made to national selection committees or by direct application to the College of Europe for individuals from a country where no selection committee exists.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.coleurop.be/template.asp?pagename=admisintro |title=College of Europe – Admission – Academic requirements |publisher=Coleurop.be |accessdate=17 September 2011}}</ref> As of 2014, there are 28 national selection committees.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.coleurope.eu/admission/selection-committees |title=College of Europe – Admission – Selection Committees |publisher=Coleurop.be |accessdate=7 July 2020}}</ref>

==== Degrees ====
The College of Europe in Bruges traditionally awards three degrees, one in European Economic Studies, one in European Legal Studies and one in Political and Governance Studies. Since the 1990s the college has also established some new degrees.

The College of Europe in Natolin awards the degree of [[Master of Arts]] in European Interdisciplinary Studies.

The current degrees awarded by the College of Europe in Bruges are:

#[[Master of Arts]] in European Economic Studies (MEES)
#[[Master of Arts]] in EU International Relations and Diplomacy Studies
#Master in European Legal Studies ([[LLM]])
#[[Master of Arts]] in European Political and Governance Studies
# Master of Arts in Transatlantic Affairs (MATA)

Currently, the master's degree requires a 15 [[European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System|ECTS]] master's [[thesis]] in English or French, while the rest of the academic year consists of courses and lectures.

The Master of Arts in Transatlantic Affairs (MATA) programme was inaugurated in 2017. It is the first-ever two-year programme of studies at the College of Europe. Offered together with The [[Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy]] (Tufts University, Medford, MA, USA), the programme leads to a joint diploma. Students spend one year at each institution, and can start the programme on either side of the Atlantic. They can choose to follow one of five study tracks (Economic Studies (Bruges); International Relations and Diplomacy (Bruges); Interdisciplinary Studies (Natolin); Legal Studies (Bruges); Political and Governance Studies (Bruges)). The first year of studies is entirely dedicated to coursework, including multidisciplinary courses on transatlantic affairs. During their second year, students in the MATA programme do a high-level internship as well as one semester of coursework culminating in the submission of a master's thesis. The MATA programme leads to 120 ECTS points and is offered in English.

Until the 1980s, the master's degree was officially known as the Certificate of Advanced European Studies ({{lang-fr|Certificat de Hautes Études Européennes}}) followed by the specialisation (law, economics or political and administrative studies). As part of European standardisation, the degree was renamed into the master's degrees listed above.

=== Controversy concerning Saudi Arabia ===

In February 2019, a series of press pieces published by [[EUobserver]]<ref name="euobserver.com">{{cite web|url=https://euobserver.com/institutional/144116|title=Saudis paying College of Europe to lobby MEPs|last1=Nielsen|first1=Nikolaj|website=EUobserver|accessdate=7 April 2019}}</ref> revealed that the Bruges-based institute was paid by the Saudi government to set up private meetings between Saudi ambassadors, EU officials, and MEPs.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.demorgen.be/nieuws/brugse-eliteschool-kreeg-saudisch-geld~b1e4bd6e/|title=Brugse eliteschool kreeg Saudisch geld|last1=Debusschere|first1=Barbara|website=De Morgen|accessdate=26 June 2019}}</ref> Although EU lobby transparency rules say that academic institutions should register if they "deal with EU activities and policies and are in touch with the EU institutions", the College of Europe is not listed in the EU joint-transparency register.<ref name="euobserver.com"/> On 13 February, MEP Alyn Smith of [[Greens/EFA]] wrote to ask Jörg Monar, Rector of the College of Europe, to provide assurances that the institute has not received "financial contributions from the Saudi authorities in any form" in its efforts to set up meetings with the EU institutions.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://euobserver.com/tickers/144161|title=[Ticker] College of Europe rector questioned over Saudi visit|website=EUobserver|language=en}}</ref> On 20 February, Marietje Schaake of the [[Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe group|ALDE]] group presented a written question to the European Commission on this issue.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://marietjeschaake.eu/college-of-europe-funding-by-the-saudi-government-for-lobbying-practices?color=primary|title=College of Europe funding by the Saudi Government for lobbying practices|last1=Schaake|first1=Marietje|website=Marietje Schaake|language=en|accessdate=21 May 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/E-8-2019-000928_EN.html|title=College of Europe in receipt of funding from the Saudi Government for lobbying practices|last1=Schaake|first1=Marietje|website=europarl.europa.eu|language=en|accessdate=21 May 2019}}</ref> This written question was the subject of a response from the European Commission published on 17 May in which it explained not having any direct evidence as to the facts reported, nor being able to comment on the sources of revenue of the College of Europe beyond European subsidies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/E-8-2019-000928-ASW_EN.html|title=Answer to Question No E-000928/19|website=europarl.europa.eu}}</ref> A group of College alumni collected signatures to demand the institution to stop organising private meetings between MEPs and the Saudi government.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://euobserver.com/institutional/144210|title=College of Europe alumni ask rector to cut Saudi ties|website=EUobserver}}</ref>

In a letter to the President of the European Parliament's Budget Control Committee [[Ingeborg Gräßle]], Jörg Monar, Rector of the College of Europe, confirmed the organization of trainings for Saudi officials and criticized the media for reporting them as lobbying. The rector indicated that these meetings had no lobbying dimension but sought to show to the Saudis the reasons why the Union defended certain values, privileging communication over isolation to defend European values.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://euobserver.com/institutional/144280|title=EU college defends Saudi-style visits, attacks 'sloppy' media|website=EUobserver}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.politico.eu/newsletter/politico-eu-influence/politico-eu-influence-presented-by-isf-international-womens-day-biased-tweeting-college-of-europes-saudi-links/|title=POLITICO EU Influence, presented by ISF: International Women's Day – Biased tweeting – College of Europe's Saudi links|date=8 March 2019|website=POLITICO}}</ref>

''Inside Arabia Online'', an online publication, characterised the lobbying by Saudi Arabia as part of a concerted effort to reverse the Kingdom's inclusion on the EU's "blacklist", which intends to penalize countries failing to combat terrorism financing and money laundering.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://insidearabia.com/saudi-lobbying-blocks-listing-eu-dirty-money-blacklist/|title=Saudi Lobbying Blocks Listing on EU Dirty Money Blacklist|last1=Igrouane|first1=Youssef|website=Inside Arabia Online|accessdate=9 April 2019}}</ref>

=== Allegations of sexual harassment and misogyny ===

The French language weekly news magazine [[Le Vif/L’Express]] published an article on 21 February 2019 based on the testimony of former students from recent years. The article reported a culture of sexual harassment and misogyny at the College of Europe. Cases of sexual harassment and inappropriate behaviour were described in the magazine, including [[frotteurism]], forced kisses and groping. Various students reported to Le Vif/L’Express that the administration observes a code of silence on this issue. Cases of inappropriate behaviours by the academic staff were also reported. Contacted by Le Vif/L’Express magazine, the administration replied that: "In some occasions in the past, some students have crossed the personal barriers of other students".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.levif.be/actualite/europe/sexisme-omerta-au-college-d-europe/article-normal-1095245.html|title=Sexisme : omerta au Collège d'Europe ?|last1=Ghali|first1=Soraya|website=Le Vif/L'Express|accessdate=8 April 2019}}</ref> On 5 March 2019, a former student of the College of Europe, published an opinion in Le Vif/L’Express magazine, stating that a culture of sexual harassment and misogyny existed at the College of Europe when she was studying there.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.levif.be/actualite/belgique/le-sexisme-et-le-harcelement-font-partie-integrantes-du-fonctionnement-de-nombreuses-institutions-universitaires-europeennes/article-opinion-1101477.html|title=Le sexisme et le harcèlement font partie intégrantes du fonctionnement de nombreuses institutions universitaires européennes|website=Le Vif/L'Express|accessdate=8 April 2019}}</ref>
