The '''Order of the Star of Romania''' (Romanian: '''''Ordinul Steaua României''''') is [[Romania]]'s highest civil [[Order (decoration)|Order]] and second highest [[State decoration]] after the defunct [[Order of Michael the Brave]]. It is awarded by the [[President of Romania]]. It has five ranks, from lowest to the highest: Officer, Commander, Grand Officer, Grand Cross, and Grand Cross with Collar.

==History==
{{more citations needed section|date=October 2018}}
In 1863, [[Alexandru Ioan Cuza]], the [[Domnitor]] of the [[United Principalities of Moldavia and Wallachia]], asked the [[Romanian people|Romanian]] representative to [[Paris]] to contact the then well-known jewellery house Krétly, to manufacture a [[state decoration]]. Krétly presented a model, which was immediately accepted by the domnitor, and based on his agreement, 1,000 pieces of the order were made. It was decided that the order would have five ranks: Knight (''Cavaler''), Officer (''Ofițer''), Comandor (''Comandor''), Grand Officer (''Mare Ofițer''), and Grand Cross (''Mare Cruce'').{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

Unlike all other decorations in that time that were mostly inspired on the [[France|French]] [[Légion d'honneur]], or which had their insignia like a [[Maltese cross]], the model proposed by Krétly for this order was a blue [[Cross (heraldry)|cross crosslet (''cruce repetată'')]], a design that was then unique in decorational design.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

The domnitor decided that the name of the honour would be "The Order of the Union" (''"Ordinul Unirii"''). It was planned to institute the order on 24 January 1864, the date when the 5th anniversary of his election would be celebrated and a moment that marked the unification of the principalities of [[Moldavia]] and [[Wallachia]]. Because of this, the motto of the new order would fit the event: ''"GENERE ET CORDES FRATRES"'' ("BROTHERS THROUGH ORIGINS AND FEELINGS"). The obverse of the insignia would bear the numbers "5" and "24", the days of January when he was elected in both Moldova and Wallachia.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

However, due to the overthrow of Alexandru Ioan Cuza by a palace coup, he was unable to actually institute the order, and he awarded the insignia therefore only as a personal present, not as a state decoration. Most of the insignia produced for him remained stored in the [[National Museum of Art of Romania|Royal Palace]]'s dungeons.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

[[File:Steaua Romaniei Com civ md 1877 av.jpg|left|thumb|150px|The original 1877 model - Commodore rank (obverse).]]
In April 1877, when Romania gained independence from the [[Ottoman Empire]], the debate regarding the institution of Romanian decorations was revived. [[Mihail Kogălniceanu]], [[List of Romanian Foreign Ministers|Minister of Foreign Affairs]] in the [[Ion Brătianu]] cabinet, took part in the debates in the [[Chamber of Deputies of Romania|Assembly of Deputies]] regarding the institution of a [[state decoration]]. Because of the already earlier supplied "Order of The Union", it was decided that the shape of the decoration would be the same, modifying only the [[domnitor]]'s seal. The motto was also changed, because the old one was not appropriate to the moment, to "IN FIDE SALUS" ("IN FAITH IS THE SALVATION"). Regarding the name, [[Mihail Kogălniceanu|Kogălniceanu]] insisted on "Steaua Dunării" ("The Star of The Danube").{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

The name "Steaua României" ("The Star of Romania") appeared on May 10, 1887, when the law was voted in the [[Parliament of Romania|Parliament]], as the first law of the Sovereign [[Romania]].{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

By Royal Decree (no. 1545/1932), [[Carol II of Romania|King Carol II]] changed the order of precedence in the Romanian honours system. As a result, in 1932, The Star of Romania dropped in precedence from second place (where it had been since 1906) to fourth place (after the [[Order of Carol I]] and the [[Order of Ferdinand I]]). In 1937, it dropped to seventh place. The main shape of the order, the blue repeated cross (called also "Romanian cross") was kept, but the rays between the cross' arms were replaced by four heraldic eagles with wings spread, the insignia of [[King Carol I of Romania|King Carol I]] was placed on the obverse, and the reverse bore the year of its establishment, "1877". Also the number of persons that could be awarded The Star of Romania was increased:{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

* Knight (''Cavaler''): 1,000 civilians and 350 military
* Officer (''Ofițer''): 500 civilians and 150 military
* Commodore or Commander (''Comandor''): 200 civilians and 75 military
* Grand Officer (''Mare Ofițer''): 75 civilians and 25 military
* Grand Cross (''Mare Cruce''): 35 civilians and 10 military

[[File:Steauaromaniei.jpg|left|thumb|Certificate confirming that the Star of Romania was awarded to Ernesto Burzagli in the name of King Ferdinand I.]]
In 1938, the order was given a superior rank, called ''"Clasa I"'' (First Class in [[English language|English]]), between the Grand Officer rank and the Grand Cross rank, with a maximum of 50 civilians and 15 military personnel.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

The statutes established by King [[Carol II]] were changed by [[General]] [[Ion Antonescu]] (who became ''[[Conducător]]'' on 4 September 1940). Generally, the rules were the ones used during [[World War I]]. The order "The Star of Romania" became the second in the national hierarchy, after that of the [[Order of Michael the Brave]].{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

Inspired by the [[Germany|German]] [[Iron Cross]], [[Ion Antonescu]] decided that the first three grades of the orders the Star of Romania and the Crown of Romania, with spades (swords), and the ribbon of [[Medalia "Virtutea Militară"|The Medal "The Military Virtue"]] would be awarded for exceptionally brave acts with an oak leaf, attached to the ribbon.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

After 1948, all the existing decorations were outlawed, and their wearing was forbidden. Just by keeping the insignia, one was considered a delinquent in the first years of communism.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

After many attempts, in 1998/1999 the National Order "The Star of Romania" was reinstituted, with a design similar to the one used in 1932, but without the insignia of King [[Carol I of Romania|Carol I]], and with the republican insignia.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}
