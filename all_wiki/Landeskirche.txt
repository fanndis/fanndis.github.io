In Germany and [[Switzerland]], a '''Landeskirche''' (plural: '''Landeskirchen''') is the church of a region. The term usually refers to [[Protestant]] churches, but—in case of Switzerland—also [[Roman Catholic]] dioceses. They originated as the [[national church]]es of the independent states, [[States of Germany|States of Germany (Länder)]] or [[Cantons of Switzerland|Cantons of Switzerland (Kantone, Cantons)]], that later unified to form modern Germany (in 1871) or modern Switzerland (in 1848), respectively.

==Origins in the Holy Roman Empire==
In the pre-Reformation era, the organization of the church within a ''land'' was understood as a ''landeskirche'', certainly under a higher power (the pope or a patriarch), but also possessing an increased measure of independence, especially as concerning its internal structure and its relations to its king, prince or ruler. Unlike in Scandinavia and England, the bishops in the national churches did not survive the Reformation, making it impossible for a conventional diocesan system to continue within Lutheranism. Therefore, Martin Luther demanded that, as a stop-gap, each secular ''[[Landesherr]]'' (territorial lord, monarch or a body, like the governments of republican [[Imperial estate]]s, such as [[Free Imperial Cities]] or Swiss cantons) should exercise episcopal functions in the respective territories. The principle of ''[[cuius regio, eius religio]]'' also arose out of the Reformation, and according to this a ''Landesherr'' chose what denomination his subjects had to belong to. This led to closed, insular landeskirchen. The principle was a byproduct of religious politics in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] and soon softened after the [[Thirty Years' War]].

At the time of the abolition of the monarchies in Germany in 1918, the ''Landesherren'' were ''summus episcopus'' (Landesbischöfe, comparable to the [[Supreme Governor of the Church of England]]) in the states or their administrative areas, and the ties between churches and nations came to be particularly close, even with ''Landesherren'' outside the Lutheran church. So the (Roman Catholic) [[king of Bavaria]] was at the same time supreme governor (summus episcopus) of the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in Bavaria|Evangelical Lutheran Church in Bavaria right of the river Rhine]]. In practice, the ''Landesherren'' exercised episcopal functions (''summepiscopacy'') only indirectly through [[Consistory (Lutheranism)|consistories]] ({{lang-de|link=no|Konsistorium/Konsistorien}} [sg./pl.]).

==In Germany==

===List of Landeskirchen in 1922 with changes until 1945===
Those of the following ''Landeskirchen'', which existed in 1922, founded the new umbrella [[German Evangelical Church Confederation]] ({{lang-de|Deutscher Evangelischer Kirchenbund}}, 1922–1933). There were mergers in the 1920s and under Nazi reign in 1933 and 1934.

The first date given before every entry in the table below refers to the year, when the respective church body was constituted. Such a date of constitution is somewhat difficult to fix for the 19th century, when church constitutions were reformed and came into effect, which usually provided for more or less state-independent legislative and executive bodies more or less elected by parishioners. The Protestant Reformation and some church organisation ([[Kirchenordnung]]) of course existed long before.

For the 20th century the given years refer to the formal establishment of the respective church body. The second date refers to the year, when the respective church body ceased to exist (if so), due to a merger or unwinding. The third entry gives the name of each church body alphabetically assorted by the first [[territorial entity]] mentioned in the name. This makes sense because Landeskirchen have clear regional demarcations, therefore usually somehow mentioned in their names. The post-World War I church bodies, listed below, have never existed all in the same time. One can sort the table below alphabetically or chronologically by clicking on the button with the [[Gyronny|gyronny of four]].

Also the bulk of the parishes in the Pomerania and Silesia ecclesiastical provinces were lost. 
| The new name replaced the prior [[Evangelical State Church of Prussia's older Provinces]] in 1922, accounting for the facts that the [[Weimar Constitution]] had done away with [[state church]]es in 1919, and that the old-Prussian congregations were then spreading over four sovereign states (Belgium, Czechoslovakia, Germany, and Poland) and three [[League of Nations mandate]]s (Danzig, Klaipėda, and Saar) after the different post-World War I annexations. The new name was after a denomination, not after a state any more. It became a difficult task to maintain the unity of the church, with some of the annexing states being opposed to the fact that church bodies within their borders keep a union with German church organisations. The official old-Prussian church body became a ''destroyed church'' ({{lang-de|[[:de:zerstörte Kirchen|zerstörte Kirche]]}}), since it was taken over by Nazi-submissive [[German Christians (movement)|German Christians]], who gained a majority in the general synod by the unconstitutional election imposed by Hitler on 23 July 1933. Only the Westphalia ecclesiastical province remained an ''intact church'', since the ''German Christians'' did not gain the majority in its provincial synod, while all the other old-Prussian ecclesiastical provinces within Germany were taken over by ''German Christians'' as well. The Nazi opponents formed parallel [[Confessing Church]] institutions on the old-Prussian general level as well as in the destroyed ecclesiastical provinces.

===List of Landeskirchen after 1945 with changes until 2012===
Those of the following ''Landeskirchen'', which existed in 1948, founded the new Protestant umbrella [[Evangelical Church in Germany]] ({{lang-de|link=no|Evangelische Kirche in Deutschland}}). However, following the violations of the church constitutions under Nazi reign many church bodies did not simply return to the pre-1933 status quo, but introduced altered or new church constitutions – usually after lengthy synodal procedures of decision-taking -, often including an altered name of the church body. In a process starting in June 1945 and ending in 1953 the [[Evangelical Church of the old-Prussian Union]] transformed from an integrated church body, subdivided into ecclesiastical provinces, into an umbrella-like church body, renamed into [[Evangelical Church of the Union]] under political pressure of communist [[East Germany]] in 1953.

The six old-Prussian ecclesiastical provinces (Kirchenprovinz[en], sg.[pl.]), which were not or not completely abolished by the expulsion of its parishioners from the Polish and Soviet annexed German territories, assumed independence as Landeskirchen of their own between 1945 and 1948, however, simultaneously remaining member churches within the Evangelical Church of the (old-Prussian) Union, thus rather converted into an umbrella. 
The communist dictatorship in East Germany imposed further name changes and administrative reorganisations along the inner German borders. This was reversed after unification.

There were mergers of church bodies in 1947, 1977, 1989, 2004, 2009, and 2012, and likely more are to come. The German demographic crisis and rising irreligionism influence them, especially in former East Germany. The first date given before every entry in the table below refers to the year, when the respective church body was constituted. Such a date of constitution is somewhat difficult to fix for the 19th century, when church constitutions were reformed and came into effect, which usually provided for more or less state-independent legislative and executive bodies more or less elected by parishioners. The Protestant Reformation and some church organisation of course existed long before.

For the last and this century the given years refer to the formal establishment of the respective church body. The second date refers to the year, when the respective church body ceased to exist (if so), due to a merger or unwinding. The third entry gives the name of each church body alphabetically assorted by the first territorial entity mentioned in the name. This makes sense because Landeskirchen have clear regional demarcations, therefore usually somehow mentioned in their names. The post-war German church bodies, listed below, have never existed all in the same time. The very independent and autonomous organisational structure of German Protestantism provides for unconcerted developments. One can assort the table below alphabetically or chronogically by clicking on the button with the [[Gyronny|gyronny of four]].

| The new name replaced the prior ''Brunswickian Evangelical Lutheran State Church'' in 1970, after considerations, that the church body is rather a Christian than an organisation related to the Brunswickian state. After a British-Soviet boundary adjustment between the British Zone and the [[Soviet Zone of occupation in Germany|Soviet Zone]] in July 1945 the formerly Brunswickian [[Salient (geography)|salients]] (e.g. the eastern part of [[County of Blankenburg#District of Blankenburg|Blankenburg District]], [[Hessen (Osterwieck)|Hessen am Fallstein]]) and the [[exclave]] of [[Calvörde]] became part of the Soviet zone. This did not affect the ecclesiastical affiliation. However, East Germany's sealing off its western border and its very restrictive granting of entry and exit visas made cross-border travelling for easterners almost impossible and difficult for westerners.

===Administration===

==In Switzerland==
[[Switzerland]] has no country-wide [[state religion]], though most of the [[cantons of Switzerland|cantons]] (except for [[Canton of Geneva|Geneva]] and [[Canton of Neuchâtel|Neuchâtel]]) recognise official ''Landeskirchen'', in all cases including the Roman Catholic Church and the [[Swiss Reformed Church]]. These churches, and in some cantons also the [[Old Catholic Church]] and Jewish congregations, are financed by official taxation of adherents.<ref>[https://2001-2009.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2004/35487.htm state.gov – Switzerland]</ref>

===Roman Catholic cantonal churches===
In most cantons the Roman Catholic congregations are organised in cantonal church bodies which form [[statutory corporation]]s with executive and supervising bodies elected by the parishioners. Roman Catholic Landeskirchen developed from denominationally separate committees of the cantonal governments in cantons with populations of mixed denomination, such as [[Aargau]], [[Graubünden]], [[Canton of St. Gallen|St. Gallen]] and [[Thurgau]].<ref name="Winzeler 2008 KathLandeskirchen">Christoph Winzeler, [http://www.hls-dhs-dss.ch/textes/d/D43204.php "3 - Katholische Landeskirchen"], on: ''[http://www.hls-dhs-dss.ch/index.php Historisches Lexikon der Schweiz] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100217091108/http://www.hls-dhs-dss.ch/index.php |date=17 February 2010 }}'', Retrieved 21 August 2013.</ref> These separate government committees, competent for ecclesiastical matters of the respective denomination and founded in the 16th and 17th century, were sometimes called ''Corpus Catholicorum'' (for the Roman Catholics, with the equivalent ''[[Corpus Evangelicorum]]'' for the Reformed Protestants).<ref name="Winzeler 2008 KathLandeskirchen"/>

In other cantons of prevailingly Reformed population Roman Catholic Landeskirchen were founded after World War II (except of [[Canton of Berne|Berne]] whose Roman Catholic Regional Church established already in 1939) paralleling the long established Reformed Landeskirchen in those cantons, accounting for the recognition of Roman Catholicism as equivalent denomination.<ref name="Winzeler 2008 KathLandeskirchen"/> Cantons of prevailingly Roman Catholic population then followed that example, first the [[canton of Lucerne|Lucerne]].<ref name="Winzeler 2008 KathLandeskirchen"/>

So church buildings and other real estate, religious schools, religious charitable organisations and religious counselling centres are often owned, run and financed by the funds of the cantonally competent Roman Catholic church body. Since each has executive and legislative bodies, elected by its statutory members (i.e. the parishioners of age), each Roman Catholic church body is accepted as democratic entity entitled to levy member fees (also by way of [[church tax]]), because the usage of the funds is decided by the elected representatives of those who defray them.<ref name="Winzeler 2008 KathLandeskirchen"/>

As to Roman Catholic doctrine the Roman Catholic church bodies are no churches, since there is only one hierarchic church.<ref name="Winzeler 2008 KathLandeskirchen"/> So some Roman Catholics oppose the Roman Catholic Landeskirchen as para-ecclesiastical entities paralleling the actual Roman Catholic church, while many others support the idea since they offer Roman Catholics similar opportunities to participate in church life like the Reformed Landeskirchen.<ref name="Winzeler 2008 KathLandeskirchen"/>

Some cantonal church bodies bear the name Landeskirche in their name, others are called synod, federation or association of congregations or simply Catholic church of the respective Canton. Whereas the term Landeskirche actually implies the body to be a separate denomination, the term cantonal church would better apply for Roman Catholic regional church bodies, since they form a cantonally delineated corporation of the Roman Catholic parishioners within a canton but are cooperating and providing services to their members, who in canonical sense remain members of the Roman Catholic Church pastoring them by its respective diocese.<ref name="Winzeler 2008 KathLandeskirchen"/>

The Roman Catholic cantonal church bodies form part of the [[Roman Catholic Central Conference of Switzerland]] (RKZ, official names in {{lang-de|link=no|Römisch-Katholische Zentralkonferenz der Schweiz}}, {{lang-fr|link=no|Conférence centrale catholique romaine de Suisse}}, {{lang-it|link=no|Conferenza centrale cattolica romana della Svizzera}}, {{lang-rm|link=no|Conferenza centrala catolica romana da la Svizra}}).
