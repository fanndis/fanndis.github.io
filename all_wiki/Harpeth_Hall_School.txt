'''Harpeth Hall School''' is a [[Independent school|private]], [[college-preparatory school]] for [[Single-sex education|girls]] in [[Green Hills, Nashville, Tennessee]], United States. Its beginning dates back to 1865 as a seminary for young ladies. After various mergers and name changes, the antecedent school closed in 1951, leading to the founding of the present school. The campus consists of a [[middle school]] and [[Secondary school|high school]] on a {{Convert|40|acre|adj=on}} site.

== History ==
=== Harpeth Hall ===
With the pending demise of Ward-Belmont's high school, a group of concerned citizens organized to ensure that a college-preparatory school for girls would continue in Nashville. This group purchased a 26-acre tract of land known as the P.M. Estes estate in southwest Nashville at the corner of Estes Road and Hobbs Road. One of the building committee members, Mary Elizabeth Cayce, suggested the name of the new school be "Harpeth Hall", because of the proximity to the [[Harpeth River]] and that the words sounded "euphonius"<ref name="Pethel">{{cite book |last1=Pethel |first1=Mary Ellen |title=All-Girls Education from Ward Seminary to Harpeth Hall, 1865 - 2015 |publisher=History Press |location=Charleston, South Carolina |isbn=9781626197626 |url=https://www.amazon.com/All-Girls-Education-Ward-Seminary-Harpeth/dp/1626197628 }}</ref>

In the fall of 1951, the Ward-Belmont college-preparatory division reopened on a new campus and with a new name—the Harpeth Hall School. Harpeth Hall began the new school term with 161 students in grades 9 through 12, almost all of whom had transferred from Ward-Belmont.<ref name="branscomb">{{cite journal|title=Harpeth Hall Dedicated to Training Women in Tradition of Ward-Belmont|journal=The Nashville Tennessean|date=December 10, 1951|page=2|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/111914078}}</ref> A Nashville historical marker at the 3801 Hobbs Road site commemorates the event.<ref name="marker">{{cite web|title=Historical Markers-Nashville Sites|url=http://www.nashville.gov/Historical-Commission/Services/Historical-Markers/Nashville-Sites.aspx#harpethhall|website=nashville.gov|publisher=Metropolitan Government of Nashville and Davidson County, Tennessee|accessdate=August 3, 2016}}</ref> The first head of school, Mrs. Susan S.

During the School's first decade, the facilities were expanded to include additional classroom space, an auditorium, gymnasium and cafeteria. In 1968, under the leadership of school head Idanelle McMurry, the Daugh W. Smith Middle School opened.

In 1998, a strategic plan was developed to address future faculty, program and facility needs. In 2000, a five-year, $42 million capital campaign entitled the "Campaign for Harpeth Hall" was launched to address these needs. By 2005, significant improvements to facilities were completed including a new library, a track and soccer complex, a visual arts center, and a middle school. In addition, the following facilities were renovated: the Jack C. Massey Center for Mathematics and Science, George N. Bullard Gymnasium, Frances Bond Davis Theatre, Marnie Sheridan Gallery, and Souby Hall. In 2007, the Hortense Bigelow Ingram Upper School completed major renovations on multiple buildings. A new Athletic and Wellness Center was completed in 2014.

== Diversity ==
When  Nashville public schools were desegregated in September 1970, it was a time of turbulence in public education, for fear of the uncertain effects of court-ordered busing of students to achieve racial balance.<ref name="reflections-era">{{cite news|last1=Donsky|first1=Paul|title=Reflections from an era under court order|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/113469328Reflections|accessdate=November 7, 2017|issue=Vol. 94, No. 277|publisher=Tennessean|date=October 4, 1998|page=2D|via=[[Newspapers.com]]}}</ref> Thirteen of Nashville's established private schools, including Harpeth Hall, saw an increase in enrollment after the court decision.<ref name="up-sharply">{{cite news|last1=Ohara|first1=Jim|title=Private School Enrollments Up Sharply|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/?spot=14854879|accessdate=November 5, 2017|issue=Vol.66, No. 117|publisher=Tennessean|date=August 23, 1971|page=1|via=[[Newspapers.com]]}}</ref> The [[IRS]] was ordered to deny tax-exempt status of any private school with a racially discriminatory admissions policy, but found no such discrimination even though many private schools had no black students.

== Campus facilities ==
Harpeth Hall School is located in the residential [[Green Hills, Nashville, Tennessee|Green Hills]] neighborhood of Nashville. The nucleus of the campus is Souby Hall, which is the administration building and is the original structure present when the land was purchased. Souby Hall has been extensively remodeled, but retains its original classic facade. As of 2016, there are 11 additional buildings including the upper school complex, a  middle school, a library, a gymnasium, a theater, a gallery, a mathematics and science center, a visual arts center, a center for arts and athletics, a track and soccer complex, and an athletic and wellness center. The school has a field house, an eight lane track and two softball fields. In 2007, the school installed [[AstroTurf]], a synthetic playing surface which is used for soccer and lacrosse, a first for a girls school in Tennessee.<ref name="Pethel"/>

In 2000, Harpeth Hall introduced a "laptop initiative" into the curriculum, creating a 1:1 student-to-computer ratio. Each student is given a laptop computer which is  provided on a lease and maintained by the school's technology department.<ref name="Pethel"/> A campus network links students and teachers for projects, homework and assignments.<ref name="tuitionlaptop">{{cite web|title=Admission-Affording-2015-2016 Tuition and Fee Summary|url=http://www.harpethhall.org/Affording|website=harpethhall.org|publisher=Harpeth Hall School|accessdate=August 9, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160807103821/http://www.harpethhall.org/Affording|archive-date=August 7, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Harpeth Hall collaborates with [[Montgomery Bell Academy]], a school for boys located nearby. Both schools have a strong tradition of single-gender education, but have agreed to participate in joint drama and music programs, community service projects, sharing of athletic field space, and transportation to athletic competitions.<ref name="mbahh">{{cite web|title=HH and MBA Collaboration|url=http://www.harpethhall.org/podium/default.aspx?t=151826|website=harpethhall.org|publisher=Harpeth Hall School|accessdate=July 31, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160729005652/http://www.harpethhall.org/podium/default.aspx?t=151826|archive-date=July 29, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>

== Academics ==
Harpeth Hall's curriculum offers 27 [[Advanced Placement]] and Honors courses.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

In 2009, Harpeth Hall became one of the founding members of the [[Online School for Girls]], a program that allows students to take advanced placement classes not offered by their own school.<ref name="online">{{cite web|title=Online School for Girls|url=https://www.oneschoolhouse.org/online-school-for-girls.html|website=onlineschoolforgirls.org|publisher=Online School for Girls|accessdate=August 4, 2016}}</ref>  Harpeth Hall students participated in the inaugural year of the Online School, taking classes in Multivariable Calculus, Differential Equations, Computer Programming and Genetics.

In 2011, the school opened a "Center for STEM Education for Girls". The letters stand for "Science, Technology, Engineering and Math", subjects that have stereotypically belonged to boys. The purpose of this program is to increase the number of young women pursuing college degrees and careers in the STEM fields. The program is funded through an Edward E. Ford Foundation Leadership Grant and other donors.<ref name="stemeducation">{{cite web|title=Center for STEM Education for Girls|url=http://www.stemefg.org/index.php|website=stemefg.org|publisher=Center for STEM Education for Girls|accessdate=August 4, 2016}}</ref>

An example is providing uniforms for sixth-grade African girls.<ref name="Lwalasisters">{{cite web|title=Meet our Lwala Sisters| url=https://www.harpethhall.org/podium/default.aspx?t=204&nid=951261&bl=back |website=harperthhall.org |publisher=The Harpeth Hall School|accessdate=August 20, 2016}}</ref>
