==Background==
{{further|Republican Party presidential candidates, 2016|Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016|Republican Party presidential primaries, 2016}}

In 2016, both the Democratic and Republican conventions were held ''before'' the [[2016 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics]] instead of after, as was the case in 2008 and 2012. One reason the Republican Party scheduled their convention in July was to help avoid a longer, drawn-out primary battle similar to what happened in 2012, which left the party fractured heading into the general election and eventually led to [[Mitt Romney]] losing the election to [[Barack Obama]]. The Democratic Party then followed suit, scheduling their convention in [[Philadelphia]] the week after the Republicans' convention, to provide a quicker response.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/01/23/politics/democratic-national-convention-date-set/ | title=Democratic National Convention date set | first=Alexandra | last=Jaffe | publisher=CNN | date=January 23, 2015 | accessdate=August 25, 2015 | quote=The July date is two months earlier than Democrats' 2012 convention, but it sets the Democrats up to immediately follow the GOP's festivities ... Republicans moved their convention back a month in hopes of avoiding the drawn-out primary battle that left the party fractured and their 2012 nominee wounded heading into the general election}}</ref> On May 3, Republican National Committee chairman [[Reince Priebus]] declared [[Donald Trump]] the presumptive nominee after Texas senator [[Ted Cruz]] dropped out of the race. The next day, Ohio Governor [[John Kasich]] suspended his campaign, effectively making Trump the presumptive Republican presidential nominee. Trump was the first presidential nominee of a major party since [[Wendell Willkie]], the Republican candidate in [[1940 Republican National Convention|1940]], who has held neither political office nor a high military rank prior to his nomination. He was also the first presidential nominee of a major party without political experience since General [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] first captured the Republican presidential nomination in [[1952 Republican National Convention|1952]]. This was the first Republican National Convention to be held entirely in July since [[1980 Republican National Convention|1980]]. [[Twitter]] and [[CBS News]] live streamed the convention via [[Twitter]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Collins|first1=Eliza|title=Twitter, CBS News to livestream GOP and Democratic conventions|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2016/07/11/twitter-cbs-livestream-rnc-dnc/86938676/|work=USA Today|accessdate=July 11, 2016}}</ref>

The 2016 Cleveland Host Committee, an Ohio nonprofit corporation with no political affiliation, was the official and federally designated Presidential Convention Host Committee for the convention.

The Cleveland 2016 Host Committee, who "facilitated construction of the 'cloakroom" space' for Republican lawmakers, which consisted of an "exclusive office, lounge and gathering space" built on the Cleveland Cavaliers practice court, received $923,100 from the Friends of the House 2016 LLC".

Giovanni Cicione of [[Rhode Island]], a platform committee member, led "a dissident group of Republican delegates" who opposed the [[Anti-LGBT rhetoric|anti-LGBT]] provisions of the sixty-page, committee-adopted platform and sought to replace it with a two-page "statement of principles" that avoided controversial issues such as same-sex marriage.<ref name="EpsteinDissidenGroup"/><ref name="KopanFloorDebate">Tal Kopan, [http://www.cnn.com/2016/07/12/politics/gop-platform-republican-convention-lgbt-minority-report/ Pro-LGBT Republicans look to force floor debate], CNN (July 12, 2016).</ref> Cicione tried to force a debate and vote on the platform from the [[Floor (legislative)|floor]] of the convention.<ref name="EpsteinDissidenGroup"/><ref name="KopanFloorDebate"/> Cicione's effort was unsuccessful; on the first day of the convention, the delegates approved the platform by voice vote, with only a few scattered "nays" audible.<ref>Scott Bixby, [https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/jul/18/republican-national-convention-2016-day-one-donald-trump?page=with:block-578d3f06e4b0ae77712da03b#block-578d3f06e4b0ae77712da03b Republican convention live: Republican National Convention ratifies party platform], ''The Guardian'' (July 18, 2016).</ref>

On the afternoon of July 18, 2016, a group of delegates sought to force a roll-call vote on the proposed convention rules package adopted by the Rules Committee.<ref name="ProtestsBreakOut">Tal Kopan & Tom LoBianco, [http://www.cnn.com/2016/07/18/politics/rnc-procedural-votes-rules-committee/ Protests break out on convention floor after anti-Trump effort fails], CNN (July 18, 2016).</ref><ref name="PetersRappeportFloorFight">Jeremy W.

That morning, a petition for a roll call vote was submitted with the signatures of a majority of delegates from ten states.<ref name=wapo/> That afternoon, the Presiding Officer, Rep. [[Steve Womack]] of Arkansas, did not recognize delegates clamoring for recognition over the rules package for the convention. Womack first declared the [[previous question]] was ordered by [[unanimous consent]] despite loud cries of objection. The rules were then adopted by [[voice vote]], prompting loud cries of protest from delegates demanding recognition for a roll-call vote.<ref name="ProtestsBreakOut"/><ref name=wapo>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/republican-national-convention-trump-cleveland/2016/07/18/d5370996-4cdd-11e6-a422-83ab49ed5e6a_story.html|title=Republican National Convention: Brief chaos as anti-Trump delegates are rebuffed|last=Sean Sullivan and Ed O'Keefe|date=July 18, 2016|website=The Washington Post|access-date=July 18, 2016}}</ref> Finally, Womack declared that a [[motion to reconsider|Reconsideration of a motion]] was [[Table (parliamentary procedure)|laid upon the table]] by unanimous consent, again to cries of objection. With loud cries throughout the convention hall, Womack abandoned the podium for several minutes, allowing RNC and Trump whips to work the floor and collect withdrawal signatures from the petition for a roll call vote.<ref>[http://www.politico.com/story/2016/07/never-trump-delegates-have-support-needed-to-force-rules-vote-225716 Chaos erupts on GOP convention floor after voice vote shuts down Never Trump forces] ''Politico''</ref> Womack then reappeared and, again using unanimous consent, stated he would put the question of adopting the rules to the convention for a voice vote a second time. A second voice vote was taken. Womack then recognized the leader of the Utah delegation, who requested a roll call vote. Womack denied the motion, ruling that there were insufficient signatures to compel such a vote,<ref name="ProtestsBreakOut"/> and announcing that while there had initially appeared to be nine state delegations that agreed to the roll-call vote, enough signatures had since been withdrawn to cause three states to fall below the threshold, thus missing the required seven states needed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.c-span.org/video/?c4611609/rnc-denies-roll-call-vote-convention-rules-amid-floor-protests|title=RNC Denies Roll Call Vote on Convention Rules Amid Floor Protests|last=Caitlin Hillyard|date=July 18, 2016|website=C-SPAN|access-date=July 18, 2016}}</ref> It was reported that Trump campaign aides and RNC staff worked on the floor to persuade delegates to withdraw their support and "challenged the validity of various signatures."<ref name="ProtestsBreakOut"/><ref name="PetersRappeportFloorFight"/> Delegates, including Senator [[Mike Lee (U.S. politician)|Mike Lee]] of Utah, sought recognition and repeatedly called for a [[point of order]],<ref name="TWS">[http://www.weeklystandard.com/mike-lee-fights-the-rnc-machine/article/2003368 Mike Lee Fights the RNC Machine] ''The Weekly Standard''</ref> but were ignored by Womack, and reportedly had their microphones turned off.<ref name="bloomberg07182016">[https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2016-07-18/republican-rules-panel-said-to-quash-anti-trump-effort Anti-Trump Factions Disrupt Vote at Republican Convention] Bloomberg</ref> Lee said he had "never seen anything like this" after Womack declined to recognize their objections and walked off the stage,<ref name="TWS"/> and [[Ken Cuccinelli]], the Virginia delegation chairman, said the RNC "cheated" and "violate[d] their own rules."<ref name="bloomberg07182016"/> The process prompted the Colorado delegation to walk out in protest.<ref name="ProtestsBreakOut"/>

Trump spoke for 75 minutes, making his speech the longest since at least the [[1972 Republican National Convention]] and one of the longest acceptance speeches ever in major-party convention history.<ref name="healy1"/>  In his speech, Trump stated that America faces a "crisis" due to "attacks on our police" and "terrorism in our cities," and emphasized an important theme in his campaign: [[law and order (politics)|law and order]].<ref name="healy1">{{cite news|last1=Healy|first1=Patrick|last2=Martin|first2=Jonathan|title=His Tone Dark, Donald Trump Takes G.O.P.

Philip Rucker and [[David Fahrenthold]] of the ''Washington Post'' found Trump's speech to be "relentlessly gloomy," and observed that Trump painted himself as an agent of change, while he cast Clinton as a defender of the status quo.<ref name="rucker1">{{cite news|last1=Rucker|first1=Philip|last2=Fahrenthold|first2=David|title=Donald Trump positions himself as the voice of 'the forgotten men and women'|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/in-speech-at-republican-national-convention-trump-to-paint-dire-picture-of-america/2016/07/21/418f9ae6-4fad-11e6-aa14-e0c1087f7583_story.html|accessdate=July 22, 2016|work=The Washington Post|date=July 22, 2016}}</ref> Trump's speech was variously dubbed the "Mourning in America" speech<ref name="sabato">{{cite news|last1=Sabato|first1=Larry|title=Clinton-Kaine: A Not-So Surprising Ticket|url=http://www.centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/articles/clinton-kaine-a-not-so-surprising-ticket/|accessdate=July 23, 2016|publisher=University of Virginia|date=July 22, 2016}}</ref> and the "Evening in America" speech<ref>"[http://freebeacon.com/blog/evening-in-america/ Evening in America]," ''[[The Washington Free Beacon]]''.

Some LGBT advocates critiqued Trump's reference to LGBT people, on the ground that it stood in contrast to positions he had taken on LGBT issues during the campaign; activists such as [[Chad Griffin]] of the [[Human Rights Campaign]] and Rick Zbur of [[Equality California]] suggested that the statement was an attempt to turn LGBT people against Muslims and pit minority groups against each other.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonblade.com/2016/07/22/trump-makes-history-lgbt-inclusion-acceptance-speech/|date=July 22, 2016|title=Trump makes history with LGBT inclusion in acceptance speech|newspaper=Washington Blade|author=Chris Johnson|quote=But Trump's pledge to protect LGBT people against terrorism stands in contrast to positions on LGBT rights he has staked out on the campaign trail. ...

A [[Gallup (company)|Gallup]] survey found that 35% of Americans saw Trump's speech positively (either "excellent" or "good"), while 36% saw it negatively.<ref name="GallupPoll" /><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/08/01/more-people-watched-donald-trumps-convention-speech-than-hillary-clintons-and-hated-it/|title=More people watched Donald Trump's convention speech than Hillary Clinton's — and hated it|website=Washington Post|access-date=2016-08-02}}</ref> According to Gallup, the speech had "the least positive reviews of any speech we have tested after the fact."<ref name="GallupPoll">{{cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/opinion/polling-matters/194000/first-time-trump-image-par-clinton.aspx|title=For First Time, Trump's Image on Par With Clinton's|last=Inc.|first=Gallup|access-date=2016-07-27}}</ref> 36% of Americans said the convention made them more likely to vote for Trump, while 51% said it made them less likely to vote for him. This is the highest "less likely to vote" percentage for a candidate in the 15 times Gallup has asked this question after a convention.<ref name="GallupPoll" /> It is also the first time in Gallup's convention polling that a Democratic or Republican convention has made more say that they are less likely to vote for the party's nominee.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/194084/americans-positive-democratic-gop-convention.aspx|title=Americans More Positive About Democratic Than GOP Convention|last=Inc|first=Gallup|website=Gallup.com|access-date=2016-08-01}}</ref>

According to a CNN/ORC poll, the public rendered a split decision on whether the convention made them more or less likely to back Trump, with 42% saying more likely while 44% saying less so.<ref name=":0" /> 40% called the speech "excellent or good," and about half of voters (45%) said Trump's speech reflected the way they feel about things in the U.S. today.<ref name=":0" /> However, some negative numbers included the fact that 18% called Trump's speech "terrible," which was the highest number recorded in that category by CNN since it first started to ask the question in 1996.<ref name=":0">{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/07/25/politics/donald-trump-hillary-clinton-poll/index.html|title=Trump bounces into the lead|last=Director|first=Jennifer Agiesta|publisher=CNN|access-date=2016-07-27}}</ref>

==Demonstrations==
The number of demonstrators was significantly lower than expected and, according to Cleveland records, three of five officially permitted protests planned for the first three days of the convention did not occur. Lower-than-expected was attributed to a variety of factors, including "fear of violence from the police and fear of violence from the Trump supporters"; Cleveland's relatively small size compared to cities such as Chicago or New York; and a heavy police presence.<ref>Scott Malone & Daniel Trotta, [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-cleveland-protests-idUSKCN1011CS They held a convention in Cleveland, and (so far) few protesters came], Reuters (July 22, 2016).</ref>

On July 19, the convention's second day, peaceful protests continued.

On July 20, the convention's third day, seventeen people were arrested, and two officers sustained minor injuries. The ''International Business Journal'' reported: "News reports and videos circulated on social media about the increasingly tense nature of protests that have included activists from [[Black Lives Matter]], the [[Ku Klux Klan]] and the [[Westboro Baptist Church]], in addition to ardent supporters for Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton."<ref>Bruce Wright, [http://www.ibtimes.com/cleveland-police-assaulted-rnc-protesters-arrested-demonstrations-rage-day-3-2393391 Cleveland Police Assaulted, RNC Protesters Arrested as Demonstrations Rage on Day 3 of Republican National Convention], ''International Business Times'' (July 20, 2016).</ref>
