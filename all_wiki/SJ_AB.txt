'''SJ''' (formally SJ AB) is a government-owned passenger [[train]] operator in [[Sweden]]. SJ was created in 2001, out of the [[public transport]] division of ''[[Statens Järnvägar]]'', when the former [[Government agencies in Sweden|government agency]] was divided into six separate government-owned limited companies. In 2018 SJ carried 31.8 million passengers.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.sj.se/content/dam/SJ/pdf/Års-och-hållbarhetsredovisningar/Engelska/SJ-Annual-Report-2018.pdf|title=SJ - Annual and Sustainability Report 2018|website=www.sj.se|date=2018|accessdate=6 September 2019|page=4}}</ref>

==Overview==
SJ's operations fall broadly into subsidised and unsubsidised services. The unsubsidised services was until 2011 monopoly and consist mainly of the [[X 2000]] [[higher speed train]] network. The subsidised trains are awarded through competitive bids. However, some trains fall in between these categories, since public transit agencies can pay SJ to allow transit pass holders access to SJ's trains.

SJ received a government bailout a few years after its creation, but has since had profit margins of up to ten per cent. All train operators in Sweden pay low track access charges to the track authority, [[Trafikverket]].

==Rolling stock==
===SJ higher speed services (''SJ Snabbtåg'')===
X2 serves for [[higher speed train]]s, with a top speed of 200&nbsp;km/h, and tilts during high speed turns. The trains serve the Stockholm-Gothenburg (Västra Stambanan), Stockholm-Malmö-Copenhagen (Södra Stambanan and Öresund Line), Stockholm-Sundsvall and, seasonally, Stockholm-Strömstad, Stockholm-Oslo and Stockholm-Östersund-(Duved) lines. There are about 40 X2 sets in service.
X55 is a newer train introduced in 2012. The interior is mainly modern style, and the train has a top speed of 200&nbsp;km/h and serves Stockholm-Östersund-(Duved) (Mittbanan-Norra Stambanan)-Stockholm-Uddevalla (Västra Stambanan and Bohusbanan) to advance to Gothenburg for night parking-Stockholm-Sundsvall-Umeå (Ostkustbanan, Botniabanan), Gothenburg-Malmö (Västkustbanan) and Stockholm-Karlstad (Västra Stambanan), Stockholm-Falun/Mora (Dalabanan).

===SJ InterCity===
InterCity trains are Rc-hauled trains, often many 2nd class cars. Most InterCity trains also have a bistro car.

===SJ Regional===
SJ Regional services include double-deckers (X40), pull and push trains, X12, X14 and X52 cars. The trains do not serve meals or drinks. The trains do not usually travel distances over 4 hours, except Stockholm-Karlstad on Fridays, Coast to Coast and Stockholm-Gothenburg via Örebro. Not all trains have first class, and these trains are usually used as commuter trains. A normal order in a pull train is [[AB7(Railway Carriage)|AB7]]-BF7-B7 or B7-BF7-B7 or AB7-B7-BF7-B7. These trains are not usually longer than 4 cars, except ''Uppsalapendeln'' (Stockholm-Uppsala) which often has 8 cars and is a push and pull.

===SJ Regional===
Most of the SJ Regional network is concentrated in the area around lake [[Mälaren]]. Operated with either Rc-hauled trainsets, X12/X14 or X40 EMUs. These trains have no cateriong on board. The X40 is equipped with free 4G WiFi in cooperation with [[TeliaSonera]]. Both first and second-class are usually offered.<ref>{{cite web |title=Our trains – SJ |url=https://www.sj.se/en/about/about-sj/our-trains.html |website=www.sj.se}}</ref>

Most of this network has been incorporated into the new Mälartåg franchise, although some services remain outside of it.

Routes listed below are the satellite routes which are not subject to franchising.

The initial contract for the Mälartåg franchise states that the operator may use their own fleet [of X12, X40 and X50 stock] until the delivery of ER1 Stadler Dosto 200 EMUs is completed. There are plans to merge the Upptåget franchise into Mälartåg onwards from the 2022 timetable, meaning that services from Gävle gain additional stations inherited from the termination of the Upptåget franchise.

===SJ higher speed trains===
SJ higher speed trains (Swedish: ''SJ Snabbtåg'') are X2 or X55 trains operating on the main routes in Sweden. The train is equipped with WiFi and has a bistro.<ref>{{cite web |title=Our trains – SJ |url=https://www.sj.se/en/about/about-sj/our-trains.html |website=www.sj.se}}</ref>

==Identity document required for travel==
From September 2009, the train operator SJ requires an [[identity document]] from passengers with a pre-paid ticket (which is mandatory on many trains). These have to be a Nordic ID card or any passport.<ref>{{cite web |title=General terms and conditions of travel – SJ |url=https://www.sj.se/en/travel-terms/general-terms-and-conditions-of-travel.html |website=www.sj.se |accessdate=4 February 2019}}</ref> This is due to an effort to stop private trading of train tickets.
