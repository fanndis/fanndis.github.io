== History ==

ESMT Berlin was founded in 2002 by 25 leading multinational firms. The school's expertise focuses on the development of responsible leaders with a global focus on innovative management, analytics, and technology and is a state-accredited university. ESMT has a satellite campus in Berlin-[[Schöneberg]] and a branch office in [[Shanghai]]. The school has more than 8,000 alumni in chapters located worldwide and around 3,500 executives and managers participate in the ESMT Executive Development Programmes each year.<ref name="Key facts {{pipe}} ESMT Berlin">{{Cite web | url=https://esmt.berlin/about | title=Key facts {{pipe}} ESMT Berlin}}</ref>

The origins of the school lay in the founding companies wanting to break from the limited, German executive education which characterized the country's business schools and the desire for a style which was less American and more culturally complex. Former ESMT President, [[Lars-Hendrik Röller]], noted in 2009 that the school are very interested in societal impact and students need to exhibit long-term, socially responsible leadership.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/student/postgraduate/mbas-guide/back-to-the-future-restored-at-a-cost-of-euro35m-esmts-story-is-that-of-modern-berlin-1696033.html | title=Back to the future: Restored at a cost of €35m, ESMT's story is that of modern Berlin}}</ref>

== Campuses ==

=== Berlin ===

The school's headquarters and main campus is located in the former [[German Democratic Republic|GDR]] Staatsratsgebäude in [[Berlin]] next to the Federal Foreign Office and opposite of the UNESCO world cultural heritage [[Museum Island]]. Constructed in 1960s' socialist architectural style to host the [[Staatsrat]] (National Council) of the GDR, it represented the supreme institution of the East German state governance.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} From 2004 to 2005 the building underwent an extensive renovation supervised by the German architect [[HG Merz]]. The main foyer is accessible to the public and guided tours are available.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.esmt.org/school-networks/about-esmt/berlin | title=ESMT Berlin {{pipe}} ESMT Berlin}}</ref>

From 1999 to 2001 the building served as the [[Federal Chancellery (Berlin)]] under former German Chancellor [[Gerhard Schröder]]. Since its renovation, it has acted as a venue for seminars, lectures, conferences, and social events for academic institutions, government agencies, as well as groups and companies.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://schlossplatz1.berlin/en/history|title=Historic beauty|website=schlossplatz1.berlin/|access-date=2020-09-10}}</ref> The building received further improvements in 2017, with the remodelling of the third floor conducted to accommodate the significant increase in the number of students. This led to the creation of the new library, four seminar rooms, the ESMT research lab, eleven group study rooms and a student lounge.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://esmt.berlin/press/esmt_berlin_expansion_2017|title=ESMT Berlin expands historic state council building|website=esmt.berlin/|access-date=2020-09-10}}</ref>

=== Cologne ===

The school's [[Cologne]] campus, Schloss Gracht, is a historic castle and grounds where the [[Metternich]] family lived for centuries. From 1968 it was the home of the Universitätsseminar der Wirtschaft (USW) which offered executive education courses. USW was later integrated into ESMT Berlin and became the site of ESMT's German-language executive education courses. After successfully integrating the courses into the main campus of ESMT in Berlin, Schloss Gracht was sold as of November 30, 2018.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://press.esmt.org/Schloss_Gracht | title=ESMT Berlin sells Schloss Gracht and moves ahead with international expansion {{pipe}} ESMT Press}}</ref> It will be converted into a [[Psychological stress|stress]] and sports medicine centre.<ref>Komuth, Horst (4 May 2018), [https://www.rundschau-online.de/region/rhein-erft/erftstadt/besitzer-wechselt-schloss-gracht-in-erftstadt-wird-zum-zentrum-fuer-stressmedizin-30115304# "Besitzer wechselt Schloss Gracht in Erftstadt wird zum Zentrum für Stressmedizin"].
