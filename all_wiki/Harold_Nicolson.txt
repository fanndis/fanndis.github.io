'''Sir Harold George Nicolson''' {{postnominals|country=GBR|size=100%|KCVO|CMG}} (21 November 1886 – 1 May 1968) was a British politician, historian, biographer, diarist, novelist, lecturer, journalist, broadcaster and gardener. He was the husband of writer [[Vita Sackville-West]].

==Early life==
Nicolson was born in [[Tehran]], Persia, the youngest son of diplomat [[Arthur Nicolson, 1st Baron Carnock]]. He spent his boyhood in various places throughout Europe and the Near East, following his father's frequent postings, including [[St. Petersburg, Russia|St. Petersburg]], [[Constantinople]], [[Madrid]], [[Sofia, Bulgaria|Sofia]] and [[Tangier]].<ref name="Nigel">{{cite book| title=Harold Nicolson: Diaries & Letters 1930–1939| author=Ed. Nigel Nicolson| publisher=Collins| year=1966| p=23}}</ref> He was educated at The Grange School in [[Folkestone, Kent]], followed by [[Wellington College (Berkshire)|Wellington College]]. He attended [[Balliol College, Oxford]], graduating in 1909 with a [[British undergraduate degree classification|third class degree]]. Nicolson entered the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office|Foreign Office]] that same year, after passing second in the competitive exams for the [[United Kingdom|Diplomatic Service]] and [[United Kingdom|Civil Service]].<ref name="Nigel"/>

==Diplomatic career==
[[File:Harold Nicolson, Vita Sackville-West, Rosamund Grosvenor, Lionel Sackville-West.jpg|thumb|left|From left to right: Harold Nicolson, Vita Sackville-West, Rosamund Grosvenor, Lionel Sackville-West in 1913]]

In 1909 Nicolson joined [[HM Diplomatic Service]]. He served as [[attaché]] at [[Madrid]] from February to September 1911, and then Third Secretary at [[Constantinople]] from January 1912 to October 1914. In 1913, Nicolson married the novelist Vita Sackville-West. Nicolson and his wife practised what today would be called an [[open marriage]] with both having affairs with people of the same sex. A diplomatic career was an honorable and prestigious one in Edwardian Britain, but Sackville-West's parents were aristocrats who wanted their daughter to marry a fellow aristocrat from an old noble family; they gave only reluctant approval to the marriage.<ref name="Johnston pages 124-137">Johnston, Georgia "Counterfeit Perversion: Vita Sackville-West's "Portrait of a Marriage"" pp. 124–137 from ''Journal of Modern Literature'' Volume 28, Issue # 1, Autumn 2004 p. 125.</ref>

During the First World War he served at the [[Foreign Office]] in [[London]], during which time he was promoted to Second Secretary. As the Foreign Office's most junior employee at this rank, it fell to him on 4 August 1914 to hand Britain's revised declaration of war to Prince [[Karl Max, Prince Lichnowsky|Max von Lichnowsky]], the German ambassador in London. In December 1917 Nicolson had to explain to Sackville-West that he had contracted a venereal disease as a result of an anonymous homosexual encounter, and he had probably passed it to her. As it turned out, he had not.<ref name="Johnston pages 124-137"/> He served in a junior capacity in the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]] in 1919, for which he was appointed [[Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George]] (CMG) in the 1920 New Year Honours.<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=31712 |date=30 December 1919 |page=5  |supp=y}}</ref>

Promoted First Secretary in 1920, he was appointed private secretary to [[Eric Drummond|Sir Eric Drummond]], first Secretary-General of the [[League of Nations]], but was recalled to the Foreign Office in June 1920. In the same year, Sackville-West become involved in an intense relationship with [[Violet Trefusis]] that nearly wrecked her marriage; as Nicolson wrote in his diary, "Damn! Damn! Damn! Violet. How I ''loathe'' her".<ref name="Johnston pages 124-137"/> On one occasion, Nicolson had to follow Vita to France, where she had "eloped" with [[Violet Trefusis]], to try to win her back. Nicolson himself was no stranger to homosexual affairs. Among others, he was involved in a long-term relationship with [[Raymond Mortimer]], whom both he and Vita affectionately referred to as "Tray". Nicolson and Vita discussed their shared homosexual tendencies frankly with each other,<ref>Bristow-Smith, ''Harold Nicolson'' pp. 164–165, 227, 249–250</ref> and remained happy together. They were famously devoted to each other, writing almost every day when separated due to Nicolson's long diplomatic postings abroad, or Vita's insatiable wanderlust. Eventually, he gave up diplomacy, partly so they could live together in England.

In 1925 he was promoted [[Diplomatic rank|Counsellor]] and posted to Tehran as [[Chargé d'affaires]]. That same year, General [[Reza Khan]] deposed the last Qajar Shah, [[Ahmad Shah Qajar]], to take the Peacock Throne for himself, and, though this was not entirely appropriate for a foreign diplomat's wife, Sackville-West became deeply involved in the coronation of Reza Khan as the new Shah. Nicolson personally disliked Reza Khan, calling him "a bullet-headed man with the voice of an asthmatic child".<ref>Ghanī Sīrūs & Ghani, Cyrus ''Iran and the Rise of the Reza Shah: From Qajar Collapse to Pahlavi Power'', London: B. Tauris, 2000 p. 394.</ref>

Reza Khan disliked British influence in Iran, and after being crowned Shah, had submitted a "categorical note" that demanded the "removal of Indian ''Savars'' [mounted guards] from Persia".<ref name="Milani, Abbas page 54">Milani, Abbas ''The Shah'', London: Palgrave Macmillan, 2010 p. 54.</ref> The ''Savars'' had been used to guard the British Legation in Tehran and various consulates across Persia, and Reza Khan felt having the troops of a foreign power marching down the streets of his capital was an infringement of Persian sovereignty. As the chargé d'affairs, Nicolson was in charge of the British Legation in the summer of 1926 and upon receiving the Iranian note, he rushed down to the Iranian Foreign Ministry to object.<ref name="Milani, Abbas page 54"/> Nicolson writing in the third person stated he had a "[[Rudyard Kipling|Kipling]] inside him and something of an 'empire builder'" told the Persian officials that the note was "so categorical to be almost offensive" and wanted it withdrawn.<ref>Milani, Abbas ''The Shah'', London: Palgrave Macmillan, 2010 pp. 54–55.</ref> The Persians stated that the note had been written by Reza Khan himself and could not be withdrawn, though ultimately an annex was added to the note, which softened its threatening tone, but much to the satisfaction of Reza Khan, the British had to abide by what Nicolson called a "frank and honest" note, withdrawing the ''Savars''.<ref>Milani, Abbas ''The Shah'', London: Palgrave Macmillan, 2010 p. 55.</ref>

In the summer of 1927 he was recalled to London and demoted to First Secretary for criticising his Minister, [[Percy Loraine|Sir Percy Loraine]], in a [[dispatch (diplomacy)|dispatch]]. However he was posted to [[Berlin]] as Chargé d'affaires in 1928 and promoted Counsellor again, but resigned from the Diplomatic Service in September 1929.

==Political career==
From 1930 to 1931 Nicolson edited the [[Londoner's Diary]] for the ''[[Evening Standard]]'', but disliked writing about high-society gossip and quit within a year.

In 1931 he joined [[Oswald Mosley|Sir Oswald Mosley]] and his recently formed [[New Party (Oswald Mosley)|New Party]]. He stood unsuccessfully for Parliament for the [[Combined English Universities (UK Parliament constituency)|Combined English Universities]] in the [[1931 United Kingdom general election|general election that year]] and edited the party newspaper, ''Action''. He ceased to support Mosley when the latter formed the [[British Union of Fascists]] the following year.

Nicolson entered the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] as [[National Labour Organisation|National Labour]] [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) for [[Leicester West (UK Parliament constituency)|Leicester West]] in the [[1935 United Kingdom general election|1935 election]]. In the latter half of the 1930s he was among a relatively small number of MPs who alerted the country to the threat of [[fascism]]. More a follower of [[Anthony Eden]] in this regard than of [[Winston Churchill]], he nevertheless was a friend (though not an intimate) of Churchill, and often supported his efforts in the Commons to stiffen British resolve and support rearmament. A Francophile, Nicolson was a close friend of [[Charles Corbin]], the Anglophile and anti-appeasement French ambassador to the court of St. James.<ref>Duroselle, Jean-Baptiste ''France and the Nazi Threat: The Collapse of French Diplomacy 1932–1939'', New York: Enigma, 2004 p. 222.</ref> In October 1938, Nicolson spoke out against the Munich Agreement in the House of Commons, saying: <blockquote>"I know that those of us who believe in the traditions of our policy, who believe that one great function of this country is to maintain moral standards in Europe, not to make friends with people whose conduct is demonstrably evil, but to set up some sort of standard by which smaller powers can test what is good in international conduct and what is not-I know that those who hold such beliefs are accused of possessing the Foreign Office mind. I thank God that I possess a Foreign Office mind".<ref>Young, Vernon "The Fine Art Of Name-Dropping: Harold Nicolson" pp. 737–744 from ''The Hudson Review'', Volume 21, Issue #4, Winter 1968–1969 p. 739.</ref></blockquote> In June 1940, Nicolson met the French writer [[André Maurois]] at time when France was on the verge of defeat, leading him to write in his diary: <blockquote>"June 12, 1940. I saw André Maurois in the morning. He left Paris yesterday. He said that never before in his life had he experienced such agony as he did when he saw Paris basking under a lovely summer day and realised that he might never see it again. I do feel so deeply for the French. Paris is to them what our countryside is to us. If we were to feel the lanes of Devonshire, the rocks of Cornwall and our own unflaunting England were all concentrated in one spot and likely to be wiped out, we would feel all the pain in the world".<ref>Young, Vernon "The Fine Art Of Name-Dropping: Harold Nicolson" pp. 737–744 from ''The Hudson Review'', Volume 21, Issue #4, Winter 1968–1969 p. 742.</ref></blockquote>

He became [[Parliamentary Secretary]] and official [[Censorship|Censor]]<ref>[[Ahmad Ali|Ahmed Ali]]. ''Twilight in Delhi''. Bombay: Oxford University Press, 1966, p. 2. This is from the introduction to the book, in which its author tells of H.N.'s role in getting it published in 1940. There is no reference to H.N.'s work in this capacity in his published Diaries, presumably due to the [[Official Secrets Act]].</ref> at the Ministry of Information in Churchill's 1940 wartime government of national unity, serving under [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|Cabinet]] member [[Duff Cooper]] for approximately a year until he was asked by Churchill to leave his position in order to make way for [[Ernest Thurtle]] MP as the Labour Party demanded more of their MPs in the Government;<ref>'' [[Human Smoke|Human Smoke: The Beginnings of World War II, the End of Civilization]]''. [[Nicholson Baker]], 2008</ref> thereafter he was a well respected [[backbencher]], especially on foreign policy issues given his early and prominent diplomatic career. From 1941 to 1946 he was also on the [[Board of Governors of the BBC]].

In 1944, during the [[Battle of Monte Cassino]], it was widely believed that the Germans were using the Monte Cassino abbey in Italy as an observation post to direct fire down at the Allied forces in the valley below, and many demanded that the abbey be bombed in order to save the lives of the Allied soldiers that were attempting to advance up the valley to take the heights of Monte Cassino, which was a key point in the Gustav line. In February 1944, Nicolson caused controversy with a column in ''[[The Spectator]]'' saying art was irreplaceable, but human life was expendable. He was opposed to bombing Monte Cassino abbey as the abbey was a great work of art that contained many works of art that could never be replaced, even if that meant the death of his own son, [[Nigel Nicolson]], who was serving in the 8th Army as it was fighting the Battle of Monte Cassino, saying it was morally better to take thousands of dead and wounded than to destroy the abbey of Monte Cassino.<ref>Young, Vernon "The Fine Art Of Name-Dropping: Harold Nicolson" pp. 737–744 from ''The Hudson Review'', Volume 21, Issue #4, Winter 1968–1969 p. 737.</ref> Much to Nicolson's chagrin, the Monte Cassino abbey was destroyed by an American bombing raid on 15 February 1944.

When Nicolson, a [[Francophile]], visited France in March 1945 for the first time in five years, upon landing in France he kissed the earth.<ref name="Bell, P. M. H. page 66">Bell, P. M. H. ''France and Britain, 1940–1994: The Long Separation'' London: Routledge, 2014 p. 66.</ref> When a Frenchman asked the prostrate Nicolson "''Monsieur a laissé tomber quelque-chose?''" ("Sir, have you dropped something?"), Nicolson replied "''Non, j'ai retrouvé quelque-chose''" ("No, I have recovered something").<ref name="Bell, P. M. H. page 66"/> The exchange is little known in Britain, but is well remembered in France.<ref name="Bell, P. M. H. page 66"/>

He lost his seat in the [[1945 United Kingdom general election|1945 election]]. Having then joined the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] (to the dismay of his family) in an unsuccessful attempt to secure a hereditary peerage from [[Clement Attlee]], he stood in the [[Croydon North (UK Parliament constituency)|Croydon North]] by-election in 1948 but lost once again.

In 1960, at the [[List of Soviet Union–United States summits|Paris summit]], Nicolson wrote about the behaviour of the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Premier of the Soviet Union|Premier]] [[Nikita Khrushchev]] that he was "a little mad" and the "exchange of insults is not the best method of conducting relations between sovereign states".<ref>Young, Vernon "The Fine Art Of Name-Dropping: Harold Nicolson" pp. 737–744 from ''The Hudson Review'', Volume 21, Issue #4, Winter 1968–1969 p. 741.</ref>

==Writer==
[[File:Sissinghurst Castle, Biddenden Road, Sissinghurst, Kent - geograph.org.uk - 1387067.jpg|thumb|[[Sissinghurst Castle Garden|Sissinghurst Castle]]]]
Encouraged in his literary ambitions by his wife [[Vita Sackville-West]],<ref>Bristow-Smith, ''Harold Nicolson'' pp. 169–170</ref> also a writer, Nicolson published a biography of French poet [[Paul Verlaine]] in 1921, to be followed by studies of other literary figures such as [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson|Tennyson]], [[Lord Byron|Byron]], [[Algernon Charles Swinburne|Swinburne]] and [[Charles Augustin Sainte-Beuve|Sainte-Beuve]]. In 1933, he wrote an account of the Paris Peace Conference entitled ''Peacemaking 1919''.

Nicolson noted that "although I loathe antisemitism I do dislike Jews".<ref>Kushner, Tony. ''The Persistence of Prejudice: Antisemitism in British Society during the Second World War''. Manchester: Manchester UP, 1989, p. 2</ref> In his diaries he expressed trepidation over making admission as a civil servant to the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office|Foreign Office]] less exclusive, writing that: "Jews are far more interested in international life than are Englishmen. And if we opened the service it might be flooded with clever Jews."<ref>{{cite book| title=Harold Nicolson: Letters & Diaries 1930–1939| author=Nigel Nicolson| publisher=Collins| year=1966| p=53}}</ref> [[Tony Kushner]] has argued that he typified the antisemite who 'warned publicly against the dangers of antisemitism at any level, yet privately hated the very presence of Jews'.<ref>Kushner, Tony. ''The Persistence of Prejudice: Antisemitism in British Society during the Second World War''. Manchester: Manchester UP, 1989, p. 98</ref> Without evidence, he assumed in his diaries in 1944 that a group of girls relaxing with American GIs were Jewish: "I am all for a little promiscuity. But nymphomania among East End Jewesses and for such large sums of money makes me sick."<ref>Kushner, Tony. ''The Persistence of Prejudice: Antisemitism in British Society during the Second World War''. Manchester: Manchester UP, 1989, p. 110</ref>

Nicolson is also remembered for his 1932 novel ''Public Faces'', which foreshadowed the [[nuclear bomb]]. A fictional account of British national policy in 1939, it tells how Britain's secretary of state tries to keep world peace with the Royal Air Force aggressively brandishing rocket airplanes and an atomic bomb. In today's terms, it was a multi-megaton bomb, and the geology of the Persian Gulf played a central role, but on the other hand the likes of Hitler was not foreseen.

After Nicolson's last attempt to enter Parliament failed, he continued with an extensive social schedule and his programme of writing, which included books, book reviews, and a weekly column for ''[[The Spectator]]''.

His diary is one of the pre-eminent British diaries of the 20th century<ref>[[Leon Edel|Edel, Leon]], [http://www.unz.com/print/SaturdayRev-1966dec03-00053/ "The Price of Peace Was War"]. ''[[Saturday Review (U.S. magazine)|Saturday Review]]'', 3 December 1966, pp. 53, 54.</ref><ref>de-la-Noy, Michael, [https://www.theguardian.com/news/2004/sep/24/guardianobituaries.books "Obituary: Nigel Nicolson"]. ''[[The Guardian]]'', 23 September 2004.</ref> and a noteworthy source on British political history from 1930 through the 1950s, particularly in regard to the run-up to World War II and the war itself: Nicolson served in high enough echelons to write of the workings of the circles of power and the day-to-day unfolding of great events. His fellow parliamentarian [[Robert Bernays]] characterized Nicolson as being "...a national figure of the second degree". Nicolson was variously an acquaintance, associate, friend, or intimate to such figures as [[Ramsay MacDonald]], [[David Lloyd George]], [[Duff Cooper]], [[Charles de Gaulle]], [[Anthony Eden]] and [[Winston Churchill]], along with a host of literary and artistic figures including C.E.M. Joad of the BBC's Brains Trust.

==Family==
He had two sons, [[Benedict Nicolson|Benedict]], an art historian, and [[Nigel Nicolson|Nigel]], a politician and writer. Nigel later published works by and about his parents, including ''[[Portrait of a Marriage]]'', their correspondence, and Nicolson's diary.

In 1930, his wife acquired [[Sissinghurst Castle Garden|Sissinghurst Castle]], near [[Cranbrook, Kent|Cranbrook]] in [[Kent]], the county known as the garden of England. The couple there created the renowned gardens that are now run by the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]].

==Honours==
He was appointed [[Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order]] (KCVO) in 1953, as a reward for writing the official biography of [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]], which had been published in the previous year.<ref name="King George V">{{cite book|title= King George the Fifth, His Life and Reign|last= Nicolson|first= Harold|year= 1952|publisher= Constable|location= [[London]]|isbn= 978-0-09-453181-9|oclc= 1633172|url= https://archive.org/details/kinggeorgefifthh00nico}} Also under {{OCLC|255946522}}.
