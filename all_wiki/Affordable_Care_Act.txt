The '''Affordable Care Act''' ('''ACA'''), formally known as the '''Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act''', and commonly known as '''Obamacare''', is a United States [[U.S. federal law|federal statute]] enacted by the [[111th United States Congress]] and signed into law by [[President of the United States|President]] [[Barack Obama]] on March 23, 2010. Together with the [[Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010]] amendment, it represents the [[U.S. healthcare system]]'s most significant regulatory overhaul and expansion of coverage since the passage of [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] and [[Medicaid]] in 1965.<ref name="Oberlander2010" /><ref name="Blumenthal2015" /><ref name="CohenEtAl" /><ref name="ReutersSCOTUS" />

The ACA's major provisions came into force in 2014. By 2016, the uninsured share of the population had roughly halved, with estimates ranging from 20 to 24 million additional people covered.<ref name="CBO_Subsidy2016" /><ref name="HHS_ASPE16">{{Cite web|url=https://aspe.hhs.gov/pdf-report/health-insurance-coverage-and-affordable-care-act-2010-2016|title=Health Insurance Coverage and the Affordable Care Act, 2010–2016|access-date=December 7, 2016|date=March 2, 2016}}</ref> The law also enacted a host of [[Healthcare industry#Delivery of services|delivery system]] reforms intended to constrain healthcare costs and improve quality. After it went into effect, increases in overall healthcare spending slowed, including premiums for employer-based insurance plans.<ref name="Kaiser15">{{Cite web|url=http://files.kff.org/attachment/summary-of-findings-2015-employer-health-benefits-survey|title=Employer Health Benefits 2015|website=Kaiser Family Foundation|access-date=November 19, 2016}}</ref>

The increased coverage was due, roughly equally, to an [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act#Medicaid expansion 2|expansion of Medicaid eligibility]] and to changes to [[Individually purchased health insurance|individual insurance]] markets. Both received new spending, funded through a combination of new taxes and cuts to Medicare provider rates and [[Medicare Advantage]]. Several [[Congressional Budget Office]] reports said that overall these provisions reduced the [[Government budget balance|budget deficit]], that repealing ACA would increase the deficit,<ref name="CBO50252" /><ref name="CBO22077" /> and that the law reduced income inequality by taxing primarily the top 1% to fund roughly $600 in benefits on average to families in the bottom 40% of the income distribution.<ref name="CBO_Dist14" />

The act largely retained the existing structure of [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]], [[Medicaid]] and the [[Health insurance in the United States#Employer sponsored|employer market]], but individual markets were radically overhauled.<ref name="Oberlander2010" /><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Gruber |first1=Jonathan |title=The Impacts of the Affordable Care Act: How Reasonable Are the Projections? |journal=National Tax Journal |date=2011 |volume=64 |issue=3 |pages=893–908 |url=https://economics.mit.edu/files/11416 |access-date=July 23, 2017 |doi=10.17310/ntj.2011.3.06|hdl=1721.1/72971}}</ref> Insurers were made to [[Guaranteed issue|accept all applicants]] without charging based on [[pre-existing condition|preexisting condition]]s or demographic status (except age). To combat the resultant [[adverse selection]], the act [[Individual shared responsibility provision|mandated]] that individuals buy insurance (or pay a fine/tax) and that insurers cover a list of "[[essential health benefits]]".

Before and after enactment the ACA faced strong political opposition, calls for repeal and [[Constitutional challenges to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act|legal challenges]]. In ''[[National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius]]'', the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] ruled that states could choose not to participate in the law's Medicaid expansion, but upheld the law as a whole.<ref name="NatLawReview2012" /> The federal health insurance exchange, [[HealthCare.gov]], faced major technical problems at the beginning of its rollout in 2013. Polls initially found that a [[Plurality (voting)|plurality]] of Americans opposed the act, although its individual provisions were generally more popular.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Kirzinger |first1=Ashley |last2=Sugarman |first2=Elise |last3=Brodie |first3=Mollyann |title=Kaiser Health Tracking Poll: November 2016 |url=http://www.kff.org/health-costs/poll-finding/kaiser-health-tracking-poll-november-2016/ |publisher=Kaiser Family Foundation |access-date=July 23, 2017 |date=December 1, 2016}}</ref> By 2017, the law had majority support.<ref>{{cite news |title=Gallup: ObamaCare has majority support for first time |url=http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/327267-poll-obamacare-has-majority-support-for-first-time |access-date=November 18, 2017 |work=The Hill |language=en}}</ref> President [[Donald Trump]] rescinded the federal tax penalty for violating the [[individual mandate]] through the [[Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017]], starting in 2019.<ref>[https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/fund-reports/2018/jul/eliminating-individual-mandate-penalty-behavioral-factors The Effect of Eliminating the Individual Mandate Penalty and the Role of Behavioral Factors]</ref> This raised questions about whether the ACA was still constitutional.<ref>Pear, Robert.

===Insurance regulations: individual policies===

All new individual major medical health insurance policies sold to individuals and families faced new requirements.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.healthcare.gov/fees/plans-that-count-as-coverage/|title=Health insurance that counts as coverage|website=HealthCare.gov|language=en|access-date=October 2, 2019}}</ref> The requirements took effect on January 1, 2014. They include:
* [[Guaranteed issue]] prohibits insurers from denying coverage to individuals due to [[pre-existing condition]]s. 
* States were required to ensure the availability of insurance for individual children who did not have coverage via their families.
* A partial [[community rating]] allows premiums to vary only by age and location, regardless of preexisting conditions. Premiums for older applicants can be no more than three times those for the youngest.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.naifa.org/practice-resources/prp/age-band-rating-(aca)|title=Age Band Rating (ACA)|publisher=[[National Association of Personal Financial Advisors]]}}</ref>
* [[Essential health benefits]] must be provided.

* Insurers are forbidden from dropping [[policyholder]]s when they become ill.<ref name="Top 18" />
* All policies must provide an annual maximum out of pocket (MOOP) payment cap for an individual's or family's medical expenses (excluding premiums).

* Insurers must [[Loss ratio#Medical loss ratio|spend at least 80–85% of premium dollars]] on health costs; rebates must be issued if this is violated.<ref name="cmsprog" /><ref name="FederalRegister" />

===Individual mandate===

The [[Health insurance mandate#Affordable Care Act|individual mandate]]<ref name="AHPAMandate" /> required everyone to have insurance or [[Provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act#Effective January 1, 2014|pay a penalty]]. The mandate and limits on open enrollment<ref name="CohnOE" /><ref name="LimitedOEForbes" /> were designed to avoid the [[Death spiral (insurance)|insurance death spiral]], minimize the [[free rider problem]] and prevent the healthcare system from succumbing to [[adverse selection]].

The mandate was intended to increase the size and diversity of the insured population, including more young and healthy participants to broaden the [[risk pool]], spreading costs.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://newrepublic.com/article/health-care/why-americans-should-support-individual-mandate |title=Common Sense |last=Cohn |first=Jonathan |date=April 9, 2010 |work=The New Republic}}<br /> {{cite news |url=https://newrepublic.com/blog/jonathan-cohn/102285/supreme-court-obamacare-mandate-severability-cbo |title=What If the Mandate Goes? |last=Cohn |first=Jonathan |date=April 2, 2012 |work=The New Republic}}<br /> {{cite news |url=https://newrepublic.com/blog/jonathan-cohn/98928/individual-mandate-mistake-health-reform-starr-cbo-ppaca |title=Was the Mandate a Mistake? |last=Cohn |first=Jonathan |date=December 26, 2011 |work=The New Republic}}</ref>

Among the groups who were not subject to the individual mandate are:
* [[Illegal immigrant population of the United States|Illegal immigrants]], estimated at around 8{{nbsp}}million—or roughly a third of the 23 million projection—are ineligible for insurance [[subsidies]] and Medicaid.<ref name="cbouninsured" /><ref name="Chaikind2011" /> They remain eligible for emergency services.
* Medicaid-eligible citizens not enrolled in Medicaid.<ref name="notcovered" />

===Premium subsidies===

Individuals whose household incomes are between 100% and 400% of the [[federal poverty level]] (FPL) are eligible to receive [[subsidy|federal subsidies]] applied towards premiums for policies purchased via a ACA exchange, provided they are not eligible for [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]], [[Medicaid]], the [[Children's Health Insurance Program]], or other forms of public assistance health coverage, and provided they do not have access to affordable coverage (no more than 9.86% of income for the employee's coverage) through their own or a family member's employer.<ref name="KaiserFamily" /><ref name="TamiLuhby" /><ref name="hip-dhhs" /> Households below the federal poverty level are not eligible to receive these subsidies. Lawfully present immigrants whose household income is below 100% FPL and are not otherwise eligible for Medicaid are eligible for subsidies if they meet all other eligibility requirements.<ref name="KaiserFamily" />) Married individuals must file taxes jointly in order to receive subsidies. Enrollees must have U.S. citizenship or proof of legal residency to obtain a subsidy.

The subsidies for an ACA plan purchased on an exchange stop at 400% of the federal poverty level (FPL). According to the Kaiser Foundation, this results in a sharp "discontinuity of treatment" at 400% FPL, which is sometimes called the "subsidy cliff".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.kff.org/health-reform/issue-brief/how-affordable-are-2019-aca-premiums-for-middle-income-people/|title=How Affordable are 2019 ACA Premiums for Middle-Income People?|last1=Fehr|first1=Rachel|last2=Claxton|first2=Gary|date=March 5, 2019|website=The Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation|language=en-US|access-date=October 2, 2019}}</ref> After-subsidy premiums for the second lowest cost silver plan (SCLSP) just below the cliff are 9.86% of income in 2019.<ref name=":82">{{Cite web|url=https://www.kff.org/health-reform/issue-brief/explaining-health-care-reform-questions-about-health/|title=Explaining Health Care Reform: Questions About Health Insurance Subsidies|date=November 20, 2018|website=The Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation|language=en-us|access-date=August 10, 2019}}</ref>

Subsidies are provided as an advanceable, [[Tax credit#State tax credits|refundable tax credit]].<ref name="sec1401" /><ref name="sec1401_p" />

The amount of subsidy is sufficient to reduce the premium for the second-lowest-cost silver plan (SCLSP) on an exchange cost a sliding-scale percentage of income. The percentage is based on the percent of federal poverty level (FPL) for the household, and varies slightly from year to year. In 2019, it ranged from 2.08% of income (100%-133% FPL) to 9.86% of income (300%-400% FPL).<ref name="hip-dhhs" /> The subsidy can be used towards any plan available on the exchange, but not catastrophic plans. The subsidy may not exceed the premium for the purchased plan.

(In this section, the term "income" refers to modified [[adjusted gross income]].<ref name="KaiserFamily" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://laborcenter.berkeley.edu/modified-adjusted-gross-income-under-the-affordable-care-act/|title=Modified Adjusted Gross Income under the Affordable Care Act|last1=Research|first1=UC Berkeley Center for Labor|last2=Education|date=July 1, 2014|website=Center for Labor Research and Education|language=en-US|access-date=October 2, 2019}}</ref>)

===Exchanges===

ACA mandated that health insurance exchanges be provided for each state. The exchanges are regulated, largely online marketplaces, administered by either federal or state governments, where individuals, families and small businesses can purchase private insurance plans.<ref name="HealthCareGov" /><ref name="aphabasics" /><ref name="CohnExchanges" /> Exchanges first offered insurance for 2014. Some exchanges also provide access to Medicaid.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mass.gov/files/documents/2019/06/28/aca-3-english.pdf|title=Paper MA ACA application (for the MA Health Connector, the state exchange)|date=August 10, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://edocs.dhs.state.mn.us/lfserver/Public/DHS-6696-ENG|title=MN ACA application (MNSURE, their state exchange)|date=August 10, 2019}}</ref>

States that set up their own exchanges gives them some discretion on standards and prices.<ref name="KaiserExchangesNotes" /><ref name="cwfstate" /> For example, states approve plans for sale, and thereby influence (through negotiations) prices. They can impose additional coverage requirements—such as abortion.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.rollcall.com/news/the_question_of_abortion_coverage_in_health_exchanges-226547-1.html |title=The Question of Abortion Coverage in Health Exchanges |last=Adams |first=Rebecca |date=July 22, 2013 |work=[[Roll Call]]}}</ref> Alternatively, states can make the federal government responsible for operating their exchanges.<ref name="KaiserExchangesNotes" />

===Cost-sharing reduction subsidies===

{{Main|Cost sharing reductions subsidy}}

As written, ACA mandated that insurers reduce copayments and deductibles for ACA exchange enrollees earning less than 250% of the FPL. Medicaid recipients were not eligible for the reductions.

So-called cost-sharing reduction (CSR) subsidies were to be paid to insurance companies to fund the reductions. During 2017, approximately $7 billion in CSR subsidies were to be paid, versus $34 billion for premium tax credits.<ref>[https://www.cbo.gov/publication/53091 "Federal Subsidies for Health Insurance Coverage for People Under Age 65: 2017 to 2027"]. Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. September 14, 2017.</ref>

The latter were defined as [[mandatory spending]] that does not require an annual Congressional appropriation. CSR payments were not explicitly defined as mandatory. This led to litigation and disruption later.

===Risk management===

ACA implemented multiple approaches to helping mitigate the disruptions to insurers that came with its many changes.

====Risk corridors====

The risk-corridor program was a temporary risk management device.<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.rubio.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/1dc92ef8-c340-4cfd-95c0-67369a557f1e/2AA5EF8F125279800BFABC8B8BA37072.05.24.2016-crs-rubio-memo-risk-corridors-1-5-16-1-redacted.pdf |title=Lawsuits to Recover Payments under the Risk Corridors Program of the Affordable Care Act |date=January 5, 2016 |access-date=February 11, 2017 |author=Legislative Attorneys, American Law Division |publisher=[[Congressional Research Service]] |page=6}}</ref>{{rp|1}} It was intended to encourage reluctant insurers into ACA insurance market from 2014 to 2016. For those years the [[Department of Health and Human Services]] (DHHS) would cover some of the losses for insurers whose plans performed worse than they expected. Loss-making insurers would receive payments paid for in part by profit-making insurers.<ref>{{citation |title=Trouble on the Exchanges – Does the United States Owe Billions to Health Insurers? |author=Nicholas Bagley |journal=New England Journal of Medicine |date=November 24, 2016 |doi=10.1056/NEJMp1612486 |pmid=27959725 |volume=375 |issue = 21|pages=2017–2019}}</ref><ref>{{citation |url=https://www.cms.gov/CCIIO/Resources/Fact-Sheets-and-FAQs/Downloads/faq-risk-corridors-04-11-2014.pdf |date=April 11, 2014 |title=Risk Corridors and Budget Neutrality |publisher=[[Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services]] (CMS) |location=Washington, DC}} [[Department of Health and Human Services]]</ref>{{attribution needed|date=July 2017}} Similar risk corridors had been established for the [[Medicare Part D|Medicare prescription drug benefit]].<ref>{{citation |title=Yes, Marco Rubio Led The Effort To End Obamacare's Health |work=Forbes |url=https://www.forbes.com/.../yes-marco-rubio-led-the-effort-to-end-obamacares-health-insuran... |date=December 15, 2015 |access-date=February 10, 2017}}</ref>

Many insurers initially offered exchange plans. However, the program did not pay for itself as planned, losing up to $8.3 billion for 2014 and 2015. Authorization had to be given so DHHS could pay insurers from "general government revenues".{{attribution needed|date=July 2017}} However, the [[Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014]] (H.R. 3547) stated that no funds "could be used for risk-corridor payments".<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/12/23/rubios-inaccurate-claim-that-he-inserted-a-provision-restricting-obamacare-bailout-funds/ |title=Rubio's inaccurate claim that he 'inserted' a provision restricting Obamacare 'bailout' funds |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |date=December 23, 2015 |first=Glenn |last=Kessler}}</ref>{{attribution needed|date=July 2017}} leaving the government in a potential breach of contract with insurers who offered qualified health plans.<ref name="latimes_GOP_ACA_corridor">{{citation |url=http://www.latimes.com/business/hiltzik/la-fi-hiltzik-risk-corridor-moda-20170210-story.html |title=With billions at stake, a federal judge just nullified the GOP's most cynical attack on Obamacare |work=Los Angeles Times |date=February 10, 2017 |access-date=February 10, 2017 |author=Michael Hiltzik}}</ref>

Several insurers sued the government at the [[United States Court of Federal Claims]] to recover the funds believed owed to them under the Risk Corridors program. While several were summarily closed, in the case of ''[[Moda Health]] v the United States'', Moda Health won a $214-million judgment in February 2017. Federal Claims judge [[Thomas C. Wheeler]] stated, "the Government made a promise in the risk corridors program that it has yet to fulfill. Today, the court directs the Government to fulfill that promise. After all, to say to [Moda], 'The joke is on you. You shouldn't have trusted us,' is hardly worthy of our great government."<ref>{{citation |url=https://ecf.cofc.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/show_public_doc?2016cv0649-23-0 |title=Moda Health Plan, Inc. v.

The Supreme Court reversed this ruling in the consolidated case, ''[[Maine Community Health Options v. United States]]'', reaffirming as with Judge Wheeler that the government had a responsibility to pay those funds under the ACA and the use of riders to de-obligate its from those payments was illegal.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|title=Maine Community Health Options v.

====Reinsurance====

The temporary reinsurance program is meant to stabilize premiums by reducing the incentive for insurers to raise premiums due to concerns about higher-risk people enrollees. Reinsurance was based on retrospective costs rather than prospective risk evaluations. Reinsurance was available from 2014 through 2016.<ref name=":4">{{Cite web|url=https://www.kff.org/health-reform/issue-brief/explaining-health-care-reform-risk-adjustment-reinsurance-and-risk-corridors/|title=Explaining Health Care Reform: Risk Adjustment, Reinsurance, and Risk Corridors|last1=Semanskee|first1=Ashley|last2=Claxton|first2=Gary|date=August 17, 2016|website=The Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation|language=en-US|access-date=November 28, 2019|last3=2016}}</ref>

====Risk adjustment====

Risk adjustment involves transferring funds from plans with lower-risk enrollees to plans with higher-risk enrollees. It was intended to encourage insurers to compete based on value and efficiency rather than by attracting healthier enrollees. Of the three risk management programs, only risk adjustment was permanent. Plans with low actuarial risk compensate plans with high actuarial risk.<ref name=":4" />

===Medicaid expansion===

{{also| Medicaid coverage gap}}
ACA revised and expanded [[Medicaid]] eligibility starting in 2014. All U.S. citizens and legal residents with income up to 133% of the [[Poverty line in the United States#Measures of poverty|poverty line]], including adults without dependent children, would qualify for coverage in any state that participated in the Medicaid program. The federal government was to pay 100% of the increased cost in 2014, 2015 and 2016; 95% in 2017, 94% in 2018, 93% in 2019, and 90% in 2020 and all subsequent years.<ref>{{cite news |author=HHS Press Office |date=March 29, 2013 |title=HHS finalizes rule guaranteeing 100 percent funding for new Medicaid beneficiaries |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=U.S. Department of Health & Human Services |url=https://www.hhs.gov/news/press/2013pres/03/20130329a.html |access-date=April 23, 2013 |quote=effective January 1, 2014, the federal government will pay 100 percent of defined cost of certain newly eligible adult Medicaid beneficiaries.

Sebelius|NFIB v. Sebelius]]'' that this provision of ACA was coercive, and that states could choose to continue at pre-ACA eligibility levels.

===Medicare savings===

Medicare reimbursements were reduced to insurers and drug companies for private [[Medicare Advantage]] policies that the [[Government Accountability Office]] and [[Medicare Payment Advisory Commission]] found to be excessively costly relative to standard Medicare;<ref name="CMSMedicarePPACA" /><ref>{{cite journal |title=Higher Spending Relative to Medicare Fee-for-Service May Not Ensure Lower Out-of-Pocket Costs for Beneficiaries |issue=GAO-08-522T |url=http://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-08-522T |publisher=Government Accountability Office |date=February 8, 2008 |access-date=October 7, 2013}}</ref> and to hospitals that failed standards of efficiency and care.<ref name="CMSMedicarePPACA" />

===Taxes===
====Medicare taxes====

Income from self-employment and wages of single individuals in excess of $200,000 annually are subjected to an additional tax of 0.9%. The threshold amount is $250,000 for a married couple filing jointly (threshold applies to their total compensation), or $125,000 for a married person filing separately.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-111hr3590enr/pdf/BILLS-111hr3590enr.pdf|title=PPACA, section 9015 as modified by section 10906}}</ref>

In ACA's companion legislation, the [[Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010]], an additional tax of 3.8% was applied to unearned income, specifically the lesser of net investment income and the amount by which adjusted gross income exceeds the above income limits.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-111hr4872enr/pdf/BILLS-111hr4872enr.pdf|title=HCERA section 1402}}</ref>

====Excise taxes====

ACA includes an excise tax of 40% ("[[Cadillac tax]]") on total employer premium spending in excess of specified dollar amounts (initially $10,200 for single coverage and $27,500 for family coverage<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/issue-briefs/2015/dec/aca-cadillac-tax |title=Rethinking the Affordable Care Act's "Cadillac Tax": A More Equitable Way to Encourage "Chevy" Consumption |publisher=[[Commonwealth Fund]]|date=December 18, 2015|first1=Sarah|last1=Nowak|first2=Christine|last2=Eibner|journal=Issue Brief (Commonwealth Fund) |volume=36 |pages=1–8 |pmid=26702468 }}</ref>) indexed to inflation. This tax was originally scheduled to take effect in 2018, but was delayed until 2020 by the [[Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016]]. Excise taxes totaling $3 billion were levied on importers and manufacturers of prescription drugs. An excise tax of 2.3% on medical devices and a 10% excise tax on indoor tanning services were applied as well.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/briefing-book/what-are-major-federal-excise-taxes-and-how-much-money-do-they-raise |title=Briefing Book|publisher=[[Tax Policy Center]]}}</ref>

===SCHIP===

The [[State Children's Health Insurance Program]] (CHIP) enrollment process was simplified.<ref name="KFF1" />

===Dependents{{anchor|Dependent's Health Insurance}}===

Dependents were permitted to remain on their parents' insurance plan until their 26th birthday, including dependents who no longer lived with their parents, are not a dependent on a parent's tax return, are no longer a student, or are married.<ref name="H.R.3590Enrolled" /><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/rss_viewer/fact_sheet_young_adults_may10.pdf |title=Young Adults and the Affordable Care Act |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161111074656/https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/rss_viewer/fact_sheet_young_adults_may10.pdf |archive-date=November 11, 2016 }}</ref>

===Employer mandate===

Businesses that employ fifty or more people but do not offer health insurance to their full-time employees are assessed additional tax if the government has subsidized a full-time employee's healthcare through tax deductions or other means. This is commonly known as the [[#Employer mandate and part-time working hours|employer mandate]].<ref name="kffpay" /><ref name="WSJ-mar25" /> This provision was included to encourage employers to continue providing insurance once the exchanges began operating.<ref name="http" />

===Delivery system reforms===

The act includes [[Healthcare industry#Delivery of services|delivery system]] reforms intended to constrain costs and improve quality. These include Medicare payment changes to discourage [[hospital-acquired condition]]s and [[hospital readmission|readmissions]], [[bundled payment]] initiatives, the [[Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation]], the [[Independent Payment Advisory Board]], and [[accountable care organization]]s.

====Hospital quality====

Health care cost/quality initiatives included incentives to [[Hospital-acquired infection|reduce hospital infections]], adopt [[electronic medical record]]s, and to coordinate care and prioritize quality over quantity.<ref name="NYMagChait2" />

====Bundled payments====

[[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] switched from [[fee-for-service]] to [[bundled payment]]s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/748502 |title=Access |website=Medscape |access-date=January 9, 2012}}{{Registration required}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.huronconsultinggroup.com/researchdetails.aspx?articleId=2577 |title=Key Healthcare Reform Initiatives: Medicare Bundled Payment Pilots |date=November 19, 2010 |publisher=Huron Consulting Group |access-date=January 9, 2012}}</ref> A single payment was to be paid to a hospital and a physician group for a defined episode of care (such as a [[hip replacement]]) rather than separate payments to individual service providers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.medicare.gov/part-d/costs/coverage-gap/more-drug-savings-in-2020.html |title=More savings in the drug coverage gap coming through 2020 |publisher=Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services |access-date=September 27, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130923130511/https://www.medicare.gov/part-d/costs/coverage-gap/more-drug-savings-in-2020.html |archive-date=September 23, 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

====Accountable care organizations====
{{main|Accountable care organization}}
The [[Medicare Shared Savings Program]] (MSSP) was established by section 3022 of the Affordable Care Act. It is the program by which an [[accountable care organization]] interacts with the federal government, and by which accountable care organizations can be created.<ref>https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare-Fee-for-Service-Payment/sharedsavingsprogram/about.html</ref> It is a [[fee-for-service]] model.

The Act allowed the creation of accountable care organizations (ACOs), which are groups of doctors, hospitals and other providers that commit to give coordinated care to Medicare patients. ACOs were allowed to continue using [[fee-for-service]] billing. They receive bonus payments from the government for minimizing costs while achieving quality benchmarks that emphasize prevention and mitigation of [[chronic disease]]. Missing cost or quality benchmarks subjected them to penalties.<ref name=":15">{{Cite web |url=http://khn.org/news/aco-accountable-care-organization-faq/ |title=Accountable Care Organizations, Explained |date=September 14, 2015 |publisher=Kaiser Health News |language=en-US |access-date=August 18, 2016}}</ref>

Unlike [[health maintenance organization]]s, ACO patients are not required to obtain all care from the ACO. Also, unlike HMOs, ACOs must achieve quality-of-care goals.<ref name=":15" />

===Medicare drug benefit (Part D)===

Medicare Part D participants received a 50% discount on brand name drugs purchased after exhausting their [[Medicare Part D coverage gap|initial coverage and before reaching the catastrophic-coverage threshold]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/brand-connect/wp/2014/03/17/what-the-affordable-care-act-means-for-prescription-coverage/ |title=What the Affordable Care Act means for prescription coverage |work=The Washington Post |access-date=August 7, 2016}}</ref> By 2020, the "doughnut hole" would be completely filled.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.medicare.gov/Publications/Pubs/pdf/11493.pdf |title=Closing the Coverage Gap – Medicare Prescription Drugs Are Becoming More Affordable |date=January 2015 |publisher=CMS |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130523191556/http://www.medicare.gov/Publications/Pubs/pdf/11493.pdf |archive-date=May 23, 2013 }}</ref>

===State waivers===

From 2017 onwards, states can apply for a "waiver for state innovation" which allows them to conduct experiments that meet certain criteria.<ref name="GPOStateWaiver" /> To obtain a waiver, a state must pass legislation setting up an alternative health system that provides insurance at least as comprehensive and as affordable as ACA, covers at least as many residents and does not increase the federal deficit.<ref name="StateWaiverConditions" /> These states can escape some of ACA's central requirements, including the individual and employer mandates and the provision of an insurance exchange.<ref name="WaPoWaiverFlexibility" /> The state would receive compensation equal to the aggregate amount of any federal subsidies and tax credits for which its residents and employers would have been eligible under ACA, if they cannot be paid under the state plan.<ref name="GPOStateWaiver" />

===Other insurance provisions===

The [[Community Living Assistance Services and Supports Act]] (or CLASS Act) established a voluntary and public [[long-term care insurance]] option for employees,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/30/health/30care.html|title=Options Expand for Affordable Long-Term Care|last=Span|first=Paula|date=March 29, 2010|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=March 29, 2010}}</ref><ref name="multiple2" /><ref>Carney, Timothy (February 28, 2011) [http://washingtonexaminer.com/blogs/beltway-confidential/2011/02/so-yeah-health-care-bill-was-really-awful-piece-legislation-sent- So, yeah, the health-care bill was really an awful piece of legislation that sent the revolving door spinning faster]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes}}, ''[[Washington Examiner]]''</ref> The program was abolished as impractical without ever having taken effect.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lifehealthpro.com/2013/01/02/watchdogs-class-still-dead|title=Watchdogs: CLASS still dead|date=January 2, 2013|publisher=LifeHealthPro|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150812185238/http://www.lifehealthpro.com/2013/01/02/watchdogs-class-still-dead|archive-date=August 12, 2015|access-date=January 2, 2013}}</ref>

[[File:Obama signs health care-20100323.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|President Obama signs the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act on March 23, 2010.]]

ACA followed a long series of unsuccessful attempts by one party or the other to pass major insurance reforms. Innovations were limited to [[health savings account]]s (2003), [[Medical savings account (United States)|medical savings accounts]] (1996) or [[flexible spending account]]s, which increased insurance options, but did not materially expand coverage. Health care was a major factor in multiple elections, but until 2009, neither party had the votes to overcome the other's opposition.

===Individual mandate===

The concept of an individual mandate goes back to at least 1989, when [[The Heritage Foundation]], a [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] think-tank, proposed an individual mandate as an alternative to [[single-payer health care]].<ref name="forbes1" /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://healthcarereform.procon.org/sourcefiles/1989_assuring_affordable_health_care_for_all_americans.pdf |first=Stuart M. |last=Butler |publisher=The Heritage Foundation |title=Assuring Affordable Healthcare for All Americans|year=1989}}</ref> It was championed for a time by conservative economists and [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] senators as a market-based approach to healthcare reform on the basis of individual responsibility and avoidance of [[free rider problem]]s. Specifically, because the 1986 [[Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act]] (EMTALA) requires any hospital participating in Medicare (nearly all do) to provide emergency care to anyone who needs it, the government often indirectly bore the cost of those without the ability to pay.<ref name="CommonSense" /><ref name="nyt-mandate" /><ref name="new-yorker-klein" />

In 2006, [[Massachusetts health care reform|an insurance expansion bill]] was enacted at the state level in Massachusetts. The bill contained both an individual mandate and an [[health insurance marketplace|insurance exchange]]. Republican Governor [[Mitt Romney]] vetoed the mandate, but after Democrats overrode his veto, he signed it into law.<ref name="governorromney" /> Romney's implementation of the [[Massachusetts health care reform#Commonwealth Health Insurance Connector Authority|'Health Connector' exchange]] and individual mandate in Massachusetts was at first lauded by Republicans. During [[Mitt Romney presidential campaign, 2008|Romney's 2008 presidential campaign]], Senator [[Jim DeMint]] praised Romney's ability to "take some good conservative ideas, like private health insurance, and apply them to the need to have everyone insured". Romney said of the individual mandate: "I'm proud of what we've done. If Massachusetts succeeds in implementing it, then that will be the model for the nation."<ref name="new-yorker-lizza" />

In 2007 Republican Senator [[Bob Bennett (politician)|Bob Bennett]] and Democratic Senator [[Ron Wyden]] introduced the [[Healthy Americans Act]], which featured an individual mandate and state-based, [[health insurance marketplace|regulated insurance markets]] called "State Health Help Agencies".<ref name="new-yorker-klein" /><ref name="new-yorker-lizza" /> The bill attracted bipartisan support, but died in committee. Many of its [[Healthy Americans Act#Sponsors and co-sponsors|sponsors and co-sponsors]] remained in Congress during the 2008 healthcare debate.<ref name="S.334summary" />

By 2008 many Democrats were considering this approach as the basis for healthcare reform.

===Healthcare debate, 2008–10===

{{See also|Health care reforms proposed during the Obama administration}}

Healthcare reform was a major topic during the [[2008 Democratic presidential primaries]]. As the race narrowed, attention focused on the plans presented by the two leading candidates, [[Hillary Clinton]] and the eventual nominee, [[Barack Obama]]. Each candidate proposed a plan to cover the approximately 45&nbsp;million Americans estimated to not have health insurance at some point each year. Clinton's proposal would have required all Americans to obtain coverage (in effect, an individual mandate), while Obama's proposal provided a [[subsidy]] without a mandate.<ref name="promise" /><ref>{{cite news |title=CNN Democratic presidential debate |url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/01/21/debate.transcript2/ |publisher=CNN |date=January 21, 2008 |access-date=September 26, 2013}}</ref>

During the [[2008 United States presidential election|general election]], Obama said fixing healthcare would be one of his top four priorities as president.<ref name="Sep2008FirstPresidentialDebate" /> Obama and his opponent, Senator [[John McCain]], both proposed health insurance reforms, though their plans differed. McCain proposed tax credits for health insurance purchased in the individual market, which was estimated to reduce the number of uninsured people by about 2{{nbsp}}million by 2018. Obama proposed private and public group insurance, income-based subsidies, consumer protections, and expansions of Medicaid and SCHIP, which was estimated at the time to reduce the number of uninsured people by 33.9 million by 2018 at a higher cost.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Rustgi |first1=Sheila |last2=Collins |first2=Sara R. |last3=Davis |first3=Karen |last4=Nicholson |first4=Jennifer L. |title=The 2008 Presidential Candidates' Health Reform Proposals: Choices for America |url=http://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/fund-reports/2008/oct/the-2008-presidential-candidates-health-reform-proposals--choices-for-america |language=en}}</ref>

This group—in particular, Democrats [[Max Baucus]], [[Jeff Bingaman]] and [[Kent Conrad]], along with Republicans [[Mike Enzi]], [[Chuck Grassley]] and [[Olympia Snowe]]—met for more than 60 hours, and the principles they discussed, in conjunction with the other committees, became the foundation of a Senate bill.<ref>{{cite web |title=Health Care Reform from Conception to Final Passage |url=http://finance.senate.gov/issue/?id=32be19bd-491e-4192-812f-f65215c1ba65 |access-date=November 23, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.c-spanvideo.org/videoLibrary/search-results.php?organization=%22Finance%22&organization=%22Senate+Committee%22&date-from=01%2F06%2F2009&date-to=01%2F02%2F2011 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120802043711/http://www.c-spanvideo.org/videoLibrary/search-results.php?organization=%22Finance%22&organization=%22Senate+Committee%22&date-from=01%2F06%2F2009&date-to=01%2F02%2F2011 |url-status=dead |archive-date=August 2, 2012 |title=Senate Finance Committee Hearings for the 111th Congress recorded by C-SPAN |publisher=C-SPAN |access-date=November 30, 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://finance.senate.gov/hearings/index.cfm?PageNum_rs=1&maxrows=100 |title=Senate Finance Committee hearings for 111th Congress |publisher=Finance.Senate.Gov |access-date=April 1, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130111185729/http://www.finance.senate.gov/hearings/index.cfm?PageNum_rs=1&maxrows=100 |archive-date=January 11, 2013}}</ref>

Congressional Democrats and health policy experts [[MIT]] economics professor [[Jonathan Gruber (economist)|Jonathan Gruber]]<ref name="GruberBio2" /> and [[David Cutler]] argued that [[guaranteed issue]] would require both [[community rating]] and an individual mandate to ensure that [[adverse selection]] and/or [[Free rider problem|"free riding"]] would not result in an [[Death spiral (insurance)|insurance "death spiral"]].<ref name="HowTheyDidIt" /> They chose this approach after concluding that [[Supermajority#United States|filibuster-proof support]] in the Senate was not present for more progressive plans such as [[Single-payer health care|single-payer]].

However, following the incorporation of an individual mandate into the proposal, Republicans threatened to [[Filibuster in the United States Senate|filibuster]] any bill that contained it.<ref name="forbes1" /> [[Party leaders of the United States Senate|Senate minority leader]] [[Mitch McConnell]], who led the Republican response, concluded Republicans should not support the bill.<ref name="ChaitLegislativeStrategy" />

[[File:9.12 tea party in DC.jpg|thumb|Tea Party protesters at the [[Taxpayer March on Washington]], September 12, 2009]]

During the August 2009 summer congressional recess, many members went back to their districts and held town hall meetings on the proposals. The nascent [[Tea Party movement]] organized protests and many [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] groups and individuals attended the meetings to oppose the proposed reforms.<ref name="reuterstimeline" /> Threats were made against members of Congress over the course of the debate.<ref name="WashPost-04092010" />

In September 2009 [[Barack Obama speech to joint session of Congress, September 2009|Obama delivered another speech to a joint session of Congress]] supporting the negotiations.<ref name="Sep2009JointAddress" /> On November 7, the House of Representatives passed the [[Affordable Health Care for America Act]] on a 220–215 vote and forwarded it to the Senate for passage.<ref name="reuterstimeline" />

====Senate====

The Senate began work on its own proposals while the House was still working. The [[United States Constitution]] requires all revenue-related bills to originate in the House.<ref name="Const-Revenue" /> To formally comply with this requirement, the Senate repurposed H.R. 3590, a bill regarding housing tax changes for service members.<ref name="ServicemembersHomeOwnershipTaxAct" /> It had been passed by the House as a revenue-related modification to the [[Internal Revenue Code]]. The bill became the Senate's vehicle for its healthcare reform proposal, discarding the bill's original content.<ref>{{USBill|111|S.AMDT.|2786}}</ref> The bill ultimately incorporated elements of proposals that were reported favorably by the Senate [[United States Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions|Health]] and [[United States Senate Committee on Finance|Finance]] committees. With the Republican Senate minority vowing to [[Filibuster in the United States Senate|filibuster]], 60 votes would be necessary to pass the Senate.<ref>{{cite news |first=Jonathan |last=Cohn |url=https://newrepublic.com/blog/the-treatment/why-reform-survived-august |title=Why Reform Survived August |work=The New Republic |date=September 7, 2009}}</ref> At the start of the [[111th United States Congress#Party summary|111th Congress]], Democrats had 58 votes. The [[United States Senate election in Minnesota, 2008|Minnesota Senate election]] was ultimately won by Democrat [[Al Franken]], making 59. [[Arlen Specter]] switched to the Democratic party in April 2009, giving them 60 seats, enough to end a filibuster.

Negotiations were undertaken attempting to satisfy moderate Democrats and to bring Republican senators aboard; particular attention was given to Republicans Bennett, Enzi, Grassley and Snowe.

After the Finance Committee vote on October 15, negotiations turned to moderate Democrats. Majority leader [[Harry Reid]] focused on satisfying centrists. The holdouts came down to [[Joe Lieberman]] of Connecticut, an independent who caucused with Democrats, and conservative Nebraska Democrat [[Ben Nelson]]. Lieberman's demand that the bill not include a [[Public health insurance option|public option]]<ref name="HowTheyDidIt" /><ref name="HackerReform" /> was met,<ref name="PublicOption" /> although supporters won various concessions, including allowing state-based public options such as Vermont's failed [[Green Mountain Care]].<ref name="PublicOption" /><ref>{{cite news |first=Jonathan |last=Cohn |url=https://newrepublic.com/blog/the-treatment/what-public-option-supporters-won |title=What Public Option Supporters Won |work=The New Republic |date=December 15, 2009}}</ref>

On December 23, the Senate voted 60–39 to end debate on the bill: a [[Cloture#United States|cloture vote]] to end the [[Filibuster in the United States Senate|filibuster]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=111&session=1&vote=00395 |title=Roll Call vote No. 395 – On the Cloture Motion (Motion to Invoke Cloture on H.R. 3590) |publisher=[[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]] |access-date=July 20, 2017}}</ref> The bill then passed, also 60–39, on December 24, 2009, with all Democrats and two independents voting for it, and all Republicans against (except [[Jim Bunning]], who did not vote).<ref name="USS RC 2009-396" /> The bill was endorsed by the [[American Medical Association]] and [[AARP]].<ref>[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/03/19/aarp-ama-announce-support_n_506060.html "AARP, AMA Announce Support For Health Care Bill: Largest Doctors And Retiree Groups Backing Legislation"].

On January 19, 2010, [[Massachusetts]] Republican [[Scott Brown (politician)|Scott Brown]] was elected to the Senate in [[United States Senate special election in Massachusetts, 2010|a special election to replace the recently deceased Edward Kennedy]], having campaigned on giving the Republican minority the 41st vote needed to sustain Republican filibusters.<ref name="reuterstimeline" /><ref>{{cite news |first=J.

Brown's election meant Democrats could no longer [[Cloture#United States|break a filibuster]] in the Senate. In response, [[White House Chief of Staff]] [[Rahm Emanuel]] argued that Democrats should scale back to a less ambitious bill; [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|House Speaker]] [[Nancy Pelosi]] pushed back, dismissing it as "Kiddie Care".<ref name="nytimesjourney" /><ref name="PoliticoPelosi" />

Obama remained insistent on comprehensive reform. The news that [[Anthem (company)|Anthem]] in [[California]] intended to raise premium rates for its patients by as much as 39% gave him new evidence of the need for reform.<ref name="nytimesjourney" /><ref name="PoliticoPelosi" /> On February 22, he laid out a "Senate-leaning" proposal to consolidate the bills.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kaiserhealthnews.org/Daily-Reports/2010/February/22/President-Obama-Health-Care-Reform-Plan.aspx |title=White House Unveils Revamped Reform Plan, GOP And Industry React |publisher=Kaiser Health News |date=February 22, 2010 |access-date=June 29, 2012}}</ref> He held a meeting with both parties' leaders on February 25. The Democrats decided the House would pass the Senate's bill, to avoid another Senate vote.

House Democrats had expected to be able to negotiate changes [[United States congressional conference committee|in a House–Senate conference]] before passing a final bill. Since any bill that emerged from conference that differed from the Senate bill would have to pass the Senate over another Republican filibuster, most House Democrats agreed to pass the Senate bill on condition that it be amended by a subsequent bill.<ref name="BillPassageOptions" /> They drafted the [[Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010|Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act]], which could be passed by the [[Reconciliation (United States Congress)|reconciliation process]].<ref name="nytimesjourney" /><ref name="Reconciliationprimer" /><ref name="538Paths218" />

Per the [[Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974|Congressional Budget Act of 1974]], reconciliation cannot be subject to a [[Filibuster in the United States Senate|filibuster]]. But reconciliation is [[Reconciliation (United States Congress)#Byrd Rule|limited to budget changes]], which is why the procedure was not used to pass ACA in the first place; the bill had inherently non-budgetary regulations.<ref>{{cite news |first=Nate |last=Silver |url=http://www.fivethirtyeight.com/2010/01/1-reconciliation-2-3-profit.html |title=1.

In other words, they're exactly the kinds of policies that are well-suited for reconciliation."<ref name="Reconciliationprimer" />

The remaining obstacle was a pivotal group of [[Anti-abortion movements|pro-life]] Democrats led by [[Bart Stupak]] who were initially reluctant to support the bill. The group found the possibility of federal funding for abortion significant enough to warrant opposition. The Senate bill had not included language that satisfied their concerns, but they could not address abortion in the reconciliation bill as it would be non-budgetary. Instead, Obama issued [[Executive Order 13535]], reaffirming the principles in the [[Hyde Amendment]].<ref name="EO13535" /> This won the support of Stupak and members of his group and assured the bill's passage.<ref name="538Paths218" /><ref>{{cite news |first=Jonathan |last=Chait |url=https://newrepublic.com/blog/jonathan-chait/stupak-makes-deal-reform-pass |title=Stupak Makes A Deal, Reform To Pass |work=The New Republic |date=March 21, 2010}}</ref> The House passed the Senate bill with a 219–212 vote on March 21, 2010, with 34 Democrats and all 178 Republicans voting against it.<ref name="USH RC 2010-165" /> The next day, Republicans introduced legislation to repeal the bill.<ref name="PelosiSawyer" /> Obama signed ACA into law on March 23, 2010.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Obama Signs Health Care Overhaul Bill, With a Flourish |first1=Sheryl |last1=Stolberg |first2=Robert |last2=Pear |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/24/health/policy/24health.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=March 23, 2010 |access-date=March 24, 2010}}</ref>

===Taxes===

[[File:Excise taxes.jpg|frameless|right|450px|Excise taxes percentage 2015]]

[[Excise tax in the United States|Excise taxes]] from the Affordable Care Act raised $16.3 billion in [[fiscal year]] 2015. $11.3 billion came from an excise tax placed directly on health insurers based on their market share. Annual excise taxes totaling $3 billion were levied on importers and manufacturers of prescription drugs.

The [[Individual mandate]] tax was $695 per individual or $2,085 per family at a minimum, reaching as high as 2.5% of household income (whichever was higher). The tax was reduced to 0 at the end of 2018.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fool.com/taxes/2018/01/07/what-the-individual-mandate-repeal-means-for-the-a.aspx|title=What the Individual Mandate Repeal Means for the Average American -|last=Caplinger|first=Dan|date=January 7, 2018|website=The Motley Fool}}</ref>

In fiscal year 2018, the individual and employer mandates yielded $4 billion each. Excise taxes on insurers and drug makers added $18 billion. Income tax surcharges produced 437 billion.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/briefing-book/what-tax-changes-did-affordable-care-act-make|title=What tax changes did the Affordable Care Act make?|website=Tax Policy Center}}</ref>

===Insurance exchanges===

As of August 2016, 15 states operated their own [[health insurance marketplace]].

As of December 2019, 37 states (including Washington DC) had adopted the Medicaid extension.<ref name="KFF_States" /> Those states that expanded Medicaid had a 7.3% uninsured rate on average in the first quarter of 2016, while the others had a 14.1% uninsured rate, among adults aged 18 to 64.<ref name="Urban_Q12016" /> Following the Supreme Court ruling in 2012, which held that states would not lose Medicaid funding if they did not expand Medicaid under ACA, several states rejected the option. Over half the national uninsured population lived in those states.<ref name="NYT52413" />

The [[Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services]] (CMS) estimated that the cost of expansion was $6,366 per person for 2015, about 49 percent above previous estimates. An estimated 9{{nbsp}}to 10 million people had gained Medicaid coverage, mostly low-income adults.<ref name=":10" /> The [[Kaiser Family Foundation]] estimated in October 2015 that 3.1 million additional people were not covered because of states that rejected the Medicaid expansion.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://kff.org/disparities-policy/issue-brief/the-impact-of-the-coverage-gap-in-states-not-expanding-medicaid-by-race-and-ethnicity/ |title=The Impact of the Coverage Gap for Adultsin States not Expanding Medicaid |date=October 26, 2015}}</ref>

In many states income thresholds were significantly below 133% of the poverty line.<ref name="Kliff, Sarah" /> Many states did not make Medicaid available to childless adults at any income level.<ref name="HealthCare Reform Magazine" /> Because subsidies on exchange insurance plans were not available to those below the poverty line, such individuals had no new options.<ref>{{cite web |title=Analyzing the Impact of State Medicaid Expansion Decisions |url=http://kff.org/medicaid/issue-brief/analyzing-the-impact-of-state-medicaid-expansion-decisions/ |publisher=Kaiser Family Foundation |date=July 17, 2013}}</ref><ref name="Families USA" /> For example, in Kansas, where only able-bodied adults with children and with an income below 32% of the poverty line were eligible for Medicaid, those with incomes from 32% to 100% of the poverty level ($6,250 to $19,530 for a family of three) were ineligible for both Medicaid and federal subsidies to buy insurance. Absent children, able-bodied adults were not eligible for Medicaid there.<ref name="NYT52413" />

Studies of the impact of Medicaid expansion rejections calculated that up to 6.4 million people would have too much income for Medicaid but not qualify for exchange subsidies.<ref>{{cite news |title=We Don't Know Everything About Obamacare.

A 2016 study found that residents of Kentucky and Arkansas, which both expanded Medicaid, were more likely to receive health care services and less likely to incur emergency room costs or have trouble paying their medical bills. Residents of Texas, which did not accept the Medicaid expansion, did not see a similar improvement during the same period.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/2100311-obamacare-has-already-improved-health-of-low-income-americans |title=Obamacare has already improved health of low-income Americans |last=Rutkin |first=Aviva |language=en-US |access-date=August 15, 2016}}</ref> Kentucky opted for increased managed care, while Arkansas subsidized private insurance. Later Arkansas and Kentucky governors proposed reducing or modifying their programs. From 2013 to 2015, the uninsured rate dropped from 42% to 14% in Arkansas and from 40% to 9% in Kentucky, compared with 39% to 32% in Texas.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/press-releases/medicaid-expansion-aca-lbetter-health-care-improved-health-low-income-adults/ |title=Medicaid expansion under ACA linked with better health care, improved health for low-income adults {{!}} News {{!}} Harvard T.H.

A 2016 [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|DHHS]] study found that states that expanded Medicaid had lower premiums on exchange policies, because they had fewer low-income enrollees, whose health on average is worse than that of those with higher income.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/26/upshot/how-expanding-medicaid-may-lower-insurance-premiums.html |title=How Expanding Medicaid Can Lower Insurance Premiums for All |last=Sanger-katz |first=Margot |date=August 25, 2016 |newspaper=The New York Times |issn=0362-4331 |access-date=September 4, 2016}}</ref>

The Census Bureau reported in September 2019 that states that expanded Medicaid under ACA had considerably lower uninsured rates than states that did not. For example, for adults between 100% and 399% of poverty level, the uninsured rate in 2018 was 12.7% in expansion states and 21.2% in non-expansion states. Of the 14 states with uninsured rates of 10% or greater, 11 had not expanded Medicaid.<ref name="Census_2018" />

A July 2019 study by the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) indicated that states enacting Medicaid expansion exhibited statistically significant reductions in mortality rates.<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Miller|first1=Sarah|last2=Altekruse|first2=Sean|last3=Johnson|first3=Norman|last4=Wherry|first4=Laura|date=July 2019|title=Medicaid and Mortality: New Evidence from Linked Survey and Administrative Data|location=Cambridge, MA|publisher=National Bureau of Economic Research|series=NBER Working Paper No. 26081|doi=10.3386/w26081|s2cid=164463149}}</ref> From that study, states that took Medicaid expansion "saved the lives of at least 19,200 adults aged 55 to 64 over the four-year period from 2014 to 2017."<ref name=CBPP>Matt Broaddus, Aviva Aron-Dine, "[https://www.cbpp.org/research/health/medicaid-expansion-has-saved-at-least-19000-lives-new-research-finds#_ftn1 Medicaid Expansion Has Saved at Least 19,000 Lives, New Research Finds.

===Insurance costs===

National health care expenditures rose faster than national income both before (2009-2013: 3.73%) and after (2014-2018: 4.82%) ACA's major provisions took effect.<ref name="cms-cost" /> Premium prices rose considerably before and after. For example, a study published in 2016 found that the average requested 2017 premium increase among 40-year-old non-smokers was about 9{{nbsp}}percent, according to an analysis of 17 cities, although Blue Cross Blue Shield proposed increases of 40 percent in Alabama and 60 percent in Texas.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/291056-next-president-faces-possible-obamacare-meltdown |title=Next president faces possible ObamaCare meltdown |last=Mali |first=Meghashyam |date=August 11, 2016 |access-date=August 15, 2016}}</ref> However, some or all these costs were offset by tax credits. For example, the [[Kaiser Family Foundation]] reported that for the second-lowest cost "Silver plan", a 40-year old non-smoker making $30,000 per year would pay effectively the same amount in 2017 as they did in 2016 (about $208/month) after the tax credit, despite a large increase in the list price. This was consistent nationally. In other words, the subsidies increased along with the premium price, fully offsetting the increases for subsidy-eligible enrollees.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://kff.org/health-reform/issue-brief/2017-premium-changes-and-insurer-participation-in-the-affordable-care-acts-health-insurance-marketplaces/ |title=2017 Premium Changes and Insurer Participation in the Affordable Care Act's Health Insurance Marketplaces |website=Kaiser Family Foundation |access-date=November 23, 2016|date=November 2016}}</ref>

Premium cost increases in the employer market moderated after 2009. For example, healthcare premiums for those covered by employers rose by 69% from 2000 to 2005, but only 27% from 2010 to 2015,<ref name="Kaiser15" /> with only a 3% increase from 2015 to 2016.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://kff.org/health-costs/press-release/average-annual-workplace-family-health-premiums-rise-modest-3-to-18142-in-2016-more-workers-enroll-in-high-deductible-plans-with-savings-option-over-past-two-years/|title=Average Annual Workplace Family Health Premiums Rise Modest 3%|date=September 14, 2016|website=Kaiser Family Foundation|access-date=November 23, 2016}}</ref> From 2008 to 2010 (before passage of ACA) health insurance premiums rose by an average of 10% per year.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/press-releases/2014/jun/new-analysis-of-health-insurance-premium-trends |title=New Analysis of Health Insurance Premium Trends in the Individual Market Finds Average Yearly Increases of 10 Percent or More Prior to the Affordable Care Act |website=Commonwealth Fund |date=June 5, 2014}}</ref>

====Deductibles and co-payments====

A contributing factor to premium cost moderation was that the insured faced higher [[deductible]]s, [[copayment]]s and out-of-pocket maximums. In addition, many employees chose to combine a [[health savings account]] with higher deductible plans, making the net impact of ACA difficult to determine precisely.

For the group market (employer insurance), a 2016 survey found that:
* Deductibles grew 63% from 2011 to 2016, while premiums increased 19% and worker earnings grew by 11%.
* In 2016, 4 in 5 workers had an insurance deductible, which averaged $1,478. For firms with less than 200 employees, the deductible averaged $2,069.
* The percentage of workers with a deductible of at least $1,000 grew from 10% in 2006 to 51% in 2016. The 2016 figure dropped to 38% after taking employer contributions into account.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/09/14/the-quiet-change-to-insurance-plans-thats-making-health-care-more-expensive-for-patients/ |title=How companies are quietly changing your health plan to make you pay more |last=Johnson |first=Carolyn Y. |date=September 14, 2016 |work=The Washington Post |access-date=September 14, 2016}}</ref>

For the non-group market, of which two-thirds are covered by ACA exchanges, a survey of 2015 data found that:
* 49% had individual deductibles of at least $1,500 ($3,000 for family), up from 36% in 2014.
* Many exchange enrollees qualify for cost-sharing subsidies that reduce their net deductible.
* While about 75% of enrollees were "very satisfied" or "somewhat satisfied" with their choice of doctors and hospitals, only 50% had such satisfaction with their annual deductible.
* While 52% of those covered by ACA exchanges felt "well protected" by their insurance, in the group market 63% felt that way.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://kff.org/health-reform/poll-finding/survey-of-non-group-health-insurance-enrollees-wave-3/ |title=Survey of Non-Group Health Insurance Enrollees, Wave 3 |date=May 20, 2016 |website=kff.org |publisher=Kaiser Family Foundation |access-date=September 14, 2016}}</ref>

===Distributional impact===

[[File:1b-ACA Distribution in 2014.png|thumb|right|upright=2.05|The distributional impact of the Affordable Care Act (ACA or Obamacare) during 2014. ACA raised taxes mainly on the top 1% to fund approximately $600 in benefits on average for the bottom 40% of families.]]

In March 2018, the CBO reported that ACA had reduced income inequality in 2014, saying the law led the lowest and second quintiles (the bottom 40%) to receive an average of an additional $690 and $560 respectively while causing households in the top 1% to pay an additional $21,000 due mostly to the net investment income tax and the additional Medicare tax. The law placed relatively little burden on households in the top quintile (top 20%) outside of the top 1%.<ref name="CBO_Dist14">{{Cite web|url=https://www.cbo.gov/publication/53597|title=The Distribution of Household Income, 2014 &#124; Congressional Budget Office|website=www.cbo.gov}}</ref>

===Federal deficit===
====CBO estimates of revenue and impact on deficit====

{{See also|United States public debt|Provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act}}

The CBO reported in multiple studies that ACA would reduce the deficit, and repealing it would increase the deficit, primarily because of the elimination of Medicare reimbursement cuts.<ref name="CBO50252" /><ref name="CBO22077" /> The 2011 comprehensive CBO estimate projected a net deficit reduction of more than $200 billion during the 2012–2021 period:<ref name="CBO22077" /><ref name="CBO43104" /> it calculated the law would result in $604 billion in [[Government spending|total outlays]] offset by $813 billion in [[Government revenue|total receipts]], resulting in a $210 billion net deficit reduction.<ref name="CBO22077" /> The CBO separately predicted that while most of the spending provisions do not begin until 2014,<ref name="CBO-Pelosi" /><ref name="RollCallCBO" /> revenue would exceed spending in those subsequent years.<ref name="CBO-Pelosi2" /> The CBO claimed the bill would "substantially reduce the growth of Medicare's payment rates for most services; impose an excise tax on insurance plans with relatively high premiums; and make various other changes to the federal tax code, Medicare, Medicaid, and other programs"<ref name="CBO-Reid-Dec2009" />—ultimately extending the solvency of the [[Medicare (United States)#The solvency of the Medicare HI trust fund|Medicare trust fund]] by eight years.<ref>{{cite news |author1=Judith Solomon |author2=Paul N.

This estimate was made prior to the [[#Legal challenges|Supreme Court's ruling]] that enabled states to [[#State rejections of Medicaid expansion|opt out of the Medicaid expansion]], thereby forgoing the related federal funding. The [[Congressional Budget Office|CBO]] and [[United States Congress Joint Committee on Taxation|JCT]] subsequently updated the budget projection, estimating the impact of the ruling would reduce the cost estimate of the insurance coverage provisions by $84 billion.<ref name="fewer" /><ref name="CBO43472" /><ref>{{cite news |last=Sahadi |first=Jeanne |url=https://money.cnn.com/2012/03/13/news/economy/health-reform-costs |title=Health reform coverage cost falls slightly |publisher=CNN |date=March 13, 2012 |access-date=June 29, 2012}}</ref>

The CBO in June 2015 forecast that repeal of ACA would increase the deficit between $137 billion and $353 billion over the 2016–2025 period, depending on the impact of macroeconomic [[dynamic scoring|feedback]] effects. The CBO also forecast that repeal of ACA would likely cause an increase in GDP by an average of 0.7% in the period from 2021 to 2025, mainly by boosting the supply of labor.<ref name="CBO50252" />

Although the CBO generally does not provide cost estimates beyond the 10-year budget projection period because of the degree of uncertainty involved in the projection, it decided to do so in this case at the request of lawmakers, and estimated a second decade deficit reduction of $1.2&nbsp;trillion.<ref name="CBO-Reid-Dec2009" /><ref name="CNN-Mar18" /> CBO predicted deficit reduction around a broad range of one-half percent of GDP over the 2020s while cautioning that "a wide range of changes could occur".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/mar/18/nancy-pelosi/pelosi-cbo-says-health-reform-bill-would-cut-defic |title=Pelosi: CBO says health reform bill would cut deficits by $1.2 trillion in second decade |last=Farley |first=Robert |date=March 18, 2010 |work=[[PolitiFact.com]] |access-date=April 7, 2010}}</ref>

In 2017 CBO estimated that repealing the individual mandate alone would reduce the 10-year deficit by $338 billion.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://politi.co/2hdAFBI|title=CBO: Obamacare mandate repeal would cut deficit by $338 billion|last=Haberkorn|first=Jennifer|website=POLITICO|language=en|access-date=November 29, 2019}}</ref>

====Opinions on CBO projections====

The CBO cost estimates were criticized because they excluded the effects of potential legislation that would increase Medicare payments by more than $200&nbsp;billion from 2010 to 2019.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/op-eds/2010/06/sen-tom-coburn-obamacare-pr-campaign-anchored-spin-not-reality/32134 |title=Sen.

Scheiber and Cohn rejected critical assessments of the law's deficit impact, arguing that predictions were biased towards underestimating deficit reduction. They noted, for example, it is easier to account for the cost of definite levels of subsidies to specified numbers of people than to account for savings from [[Preventive medicine|preventive healthcare]], and that the CBO had a track record of overestimating costs and underestimating savings of health legislation;<ref name="CBOMethodology" /><ref name="CBOTrackRecord" /> stating, "innovations in the delivery of medical care, like greater use of [[electronic medical record]]s<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.medicalrecords.com/emr-buyers-guide/electronic-medical-records-deadline|title=Electronic Medical Records Deadline|website=MedicalRecords.com}}</ref> and financial incentives for more coordination of care among doctors, would produce substantial savings while also slowing the relentless climb of medical expenses{{nbsp}}... But the CBO would not consider such savings in its calculations, because the innovations hadn't really been tried on such large scale or in concert with one another—and that meant there wasn't much hard data to prove the savings would materialize."<ref name="CBOMethodology" />

In 2010 [[David M. Walker (U.S. Comptroller General)|David Walker]] said the CBO estimates were not likely to be accurate, because they were based on the assumption that the law would not change.<ref name="deficit_david_walker_cbo_innacurate" />

===Hospitals===

From the start of 2010 to November 2014, 43 hospitals in [[Rural area#United States|rural areas]] closed. Critics claimed the new law had caused these closures. Many rural hospitals were built using funds from the 1946 [[Hill–Burton Act]]. Some of these hospitals reopened as other medical facilities, but only a small number operated [[Emergency department|emergency rooms]] (ER) or [[urgent care]] centers.<ref>{{cite news |last1=O'Donnell |first1=Jayne |last2=Ungar |first2=Laura |last3=Hoyer |first3=Meghan |date=November 12, 2014 |title=Rural hospitals in critical condition |url=https://www.usatoday.com/longform/news/nation/2014/11/12/rural-hospital-closings-federal-reimbursement-medicaid-aca/18532471/ |newspaper=USA Today |access-date=January 28, 2015}}<br />{{cite news |last=Hamada |first=Omar L. |date=November 18, 2014 |title=Obamacare has detrimental effect on rural hospitals |url=http://www.tennessean.com/story/opinion/contributors/2014/11/19/obamacare-detrimental-effect-rural-hospitals/19087985/ |newspaper=The Tennessean |access-date=January 28, 2015}}</ref>

Between January 2010 and 2015, a quarter of ER doctors said they had seen a major surge in patients, while nearly half had seen a smaller increase. Seven in ten ER doctors claimed they lacked the resources to deal with large increases in the number of patients. The biggest factor in the increased number of ER patients was insufficient primary care providers to handle the larger number of insured.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/may/4/er-visits-under-obamacare-doctors-say/#ixzz3ZH4xpm5H |title=ER visits up under Obamacare despite promises, doctors' poll finds |first=Tom Jr. |last=Howell |work=The Washington Times |date=May 4, 2015 |access-date=May 6, 2015}}</ref>

Several large insurers formed ACOs. Many hospitals merged and purchased physician practices, amounting to a significant consolidation of the provider industry. The increased market share gave them more leverage with insurers and reduced patient care options.<ref name=":15" />

==Attempted repeals==

The House, led by Republicans, repeatedly voted to repeal ACA. The Senate, led by Democrats, did not follow suit.{{Citation needed|date=July 2020}}

===Economic consequences===

[[File:Obamacare Panel 2.png|thumb|upright=2.05|right|Coverage rate, employer market cost trends, budgetary impact, and income inequality aspects of the Affordable Care Act]]

CBO estimated in June 2015 that repealing ACA would:
* Decrease GDP in the short-term, as government spending (on subsidies) was only partially replaced by spending by recipients.
* Increase the supply of labor and aggregate compensation by about 0.8 and 0.9 percent over the 2021–2025 period. CBO cited ACA's expanded eligibility for Medicaid and subsidies and tax credits that rise with income as disincentives to work, so repealing ACA would remove those disincentives, encouraging workers to supply more labor, increasing the total number of hours worked by about 1.5% over the 2021–2025 period.
* Remove the higher tax rates on capital income, thereby encouraging investment, raising the capital stock and output in the long-run.<ref name="CBO50252" />

In 2015 the progressive [[Center for Economic and Policy Research]] found no evidence that companies were reducing worker hours to avoid ACA requirements<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.randstadusa.com/workforce360/workforce-insights/the-affordable-care-act-and-employers/91/|title=The Affordable Care Act and Employers|access-date=August 11, 2016}}</ref> for employees working more than 30 hours per week.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cepr.net/blogs/cepr-blog/is-the-affordable-care-act-a-hidden-jobs-killer|title=Is the Affordable Care Act a Hidden Jobs Killer?|website=Center for Economic and Policy Research|publisher=CEPR|access-date=August 26, 2015}}</ref>

CBO estimated that ACA would slightly reduce the size of the labor force and number of hours worked, as some would no longer be tethered to employers for their insurance. Jonathan Cohn claimed that ACA's primary employment effect was to alleviate [[job lock]]<ref name="CBOjobs" /> and the reform's only significant employment impact was the retirement of those who were working only to stay insured.<ref name="ACAEconomyCohn" />

Public views became increasingly negative in reaction to specific plans discussed during the legislative debate over 2009 and 2010. Approval varied by party, race and age. Some elements were more widely favored (pre-existing conditions) or opposed (individual mandate).

In a 2010 [[Opinion poll|poll]], 62% of respondents said they thought ACA would "increase the amount of money they personally spend on health care", 56% said the bill "gives the government too much involvement in health care", and 19% said they thought they and their families would be better off with the legislation.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/2010/images/03/22/rel5a.pdf|title=CNN Opinion Research Poll|date=March 22, 2010|publisher=CNN}}</ref> Other polls found that people were concerned the law would cost more than projected and would not do enough to control costs.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704784904575111993559174212|title=Why Obama Can't Move the Health-Care Numbers|last1=Rasmussen|first1=Scott|date=March 9, 2010|work=The Wall Street Journal|last2=Schoen|first2=Doug}}</ref>

In a 2012 poll 44% supported the law, with 56% against. By 75% of Democrats, 27% of Independents and 14% of Republicans favored the law. 82% favored banning insurance companies from denying coverage to people with pre-existing conditions, 61% favored allowing children to stay on their parents' insurance until age 26, 72% supported requiring companies with more than 50 employees to provide insurance for their employees, and 39% supported the individual mandate to own insurance or pay a penalty.

Separate polls from Fox News and NBC/''WSJ'', both taken during January 2017, indicated more people viewed the law favorably than did not for the first time.

==Political aspects==
==="Obamacare"===

The term "Obamacare" was originally coined by opponents as a [[pejorative]]. The term emerged in March 2007 when healthcare lobbyist Jeanne Schulte Scott wrote, "We will soon see a '[[Rudy Giuliani|Giuliani]]-care' and 'Obama-care' to go along with '[[John McCain|McCain]]-care', '[[John Edwards|Edwards]]-care', and a totally revamped and remodeled '[[Hillarycare|Hillary-care]]' from the 1990s".<ref name="CNN20120625Obamacare" /><ref name="NYT20120325" /> According to research by Elspeth Reeve, the expression was used in early 2007, generally by writers describing the candidate's proposal for expanding coverage for the uninsured.<ref name="NYT20120803" /> In May 2007 [[Mitt Romney]] introduced it to political discourse, saying, "How can we get those people insured without raising taxes and without having government take over healthcare?' And let me tell you, if we don't do it, the Democrats will. If the Democrats do it, it will be socialized medicine; it'll be government-managed care. It'll be what's known as Hillarycare or Barack Obamacare, or whatever you want to call it."<ref name="CNN20120625Obamacare" />

By mid-2012, Obamacare had become the colloquial term used both by supporters and by opponents.<ref name="NYT20120803" /> Obama endorsed the nickname, saying, "I have no problem with people saying Obama cares. I do care."<ref>{{cite news |first=Lucy |last=Madison |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/on-bus-tour-obama-embraces-obamacare-says-i-do-care/ |title=On bus tour, Obama embraces 'Obamacare', says 'I do care{{'-}} |publisher=CBS News |date=August 15, 2011 |access-date=April 28, 2012}}</ref>

===Common misconceptions===

<!-- Please read WP:UNDUE and WP:FRINGE. Please. -->

===="Death panels"====

{{Main|Death panel|}}

On August 7, 2009, [[Sarah Palin]] pioneered the term "[[death panel]]s" to describe groups who would decide whether sick patients were "worthy" of medical care.<ref name="Not so" /> "Death panel" referred to two claims about early drafts.

One was that under the law, seniors could be denied care due to their age<ref>{{cite web |url=http://snopes.com/politics/medical/over75.asp |title=Seniors Beware |website=Snopes |date=August 23, 2012}}</ref> and the other that the government would advise seniors to end their lives instead of receiving care. The ostensible basis of these claims was the provision for an [[Independent Payment Advisory Board]] (IPAB).<ref name="salon08132013" /> IPAB was given the authority to recommend cost-saving changes to Medicare by facilitating the adoption of cost-effective treatments and cost-recovering measures when statutory expenditure levels were exceeded within any given three-year period. In fact, the Board was prohibited from recommending changes that would reduce payments before 2020, and was prohibited from recommending changes in premiums, benefits, eligibility and taxes, or other changes that would result in rationing.<ref>{{cite web |first1=Jack |last1=Ebeler |first2=Tricia |last2=Neuman |first3=Juliette |last3=Cubanski |title=The Independent Payment Advisory Board: A New Approach to Controlling Medicare Spending |url=http://kff.org/health-reform/issue-brief/the-independent-payment-advisory-board-a-new/ |publisher=Kaiser Family Foundation |date=April 13, 2011 |page=3 |access-date=November 27, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first=Jonathan |last=Cohn |url=https://newrepublic.com/blog/jonathan-cohn/87102/ipab-medicare-commission-repeal-ryan-schwartz |title=Here We Go Again, With the Death Panels |work=The New Republic |date=April 20, 2011}}</ref>

The other related issue concerned [[Advance health care directive|advance-care planning]] consultation: [[HR 3200#Reimbursement for counseling about living wills|a section of the House reform proposal]] would have reimbursed physicians for providing patient-requested consultations for Medicare recipients on end-of-life health planning (which is covered by many private plans), enabling patients to specify, on request, the kind of care they wished to receive.<ref>{{cite news |first=Jonathan |last=Cohn |url=https://newrepublic.com/blog/the-treatment/mandatory-death-counseling-exposed |title=Mandatory Death Counseling – exposed! |work=The New Republic |date=August 13, 2009}}</ref> The provision was not included in ACA.<ref>{{cite news |title=Senate committee scraps healthcare provision that gave rise to 'death panel' claims; Though the claims are widely discredited, the Senate Finance Committee is withdrawing from its bill the inclusion of advance-care planning consultations, calling them too confusing |first1=Christi |last1=Parsons |first2=Andrew |last2=Zajac |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=August 14, 2009 |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2009/aug/14/nation/na-health-end-of-life14}}</ref>

In 2010, the [[Pew Research Center]] reported that 85% of Americans were familiar with the claim, and 30% believed it was true, backed by three contemporaneous polls.<ref>{{Cite journal |first=Brendan |last=Nyhan |title=Why the "Death Panel" Myth Wouldn't Die: Misinformation in the Health Care Reform Debate |journal=The Forum |volume=8 |issue=1 |year=2010 |doi=10.2202/1540-8884.1354 |url=http://www.dartmouth.edu/~nyhan/health-care-misinformation.pdf |citeseerx=10.1.1.692.9614|s2cid=144075499 }}</ref> The allegation was named [[PolitiFact]]'s 2009 "Lie of the Year",<ref name="Not so" /><ref>{{Cite news |title=PolitiFact's Lie of the Year: 'Death panels' |publisher=PolitiFact |date=December 19, 2009 |url=http://politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2009/dec/18/politifact-lie-year-death-panels |first=Angie |last=Drobnic Holan |access-date=November 19, 2010}}</ref> one of [[FactCheck.org]]'s "whoppers"<ref>{{Cite news |title=False Euthanasia Claims |first1=Jess |last1=Henig |first2=Lori |last2=Robertson |publisher=[[FactCheck.org]] |date=July 29, 2010 |url=http://www.factcheck.org/2009/07/false-euthanasia-claims}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Whoppers of 2009—We review the choicest falsehoods from a year that kept us busy |date=December 24, 2009 |author=Lori Robertson |url=http://www.factcheck.org/2009/12/whoppers-of-2009 |publisher=[[FactCheck.org]] |access-date=April 28, 2011}}</ref> and the most outrageous term by the [[American Dialect Society]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.americandialect.org/2009-Word-of-the-Year-PRESS-RELEASE.pdf |title={{-'}}Tweet' 2009 Word of the Year, 'Google' Word of the Decade, as voted by American Dialect Society|date=January 8, 2010|publisher=[[American Dialect Society]]|access-date=October 8, 2010}}</ref> [[AARP]] described such rumors as "rife with gross—and even cruel—distortions".<ref name="snopes1" />

====Members of Congress====

ACA requires members of Congress and their staffs to obtain health insurance either through an exchange or some other program approved by the law (such as Medicare), instead of using the insurance offered to federal employees (the [[Federal Employees Health Benefits Program]]).<ref>[http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-111publ148/html/PLAW-111publ148.htm Public Law 111 – 148], section 1312: "...{{nbsp}}the only health plans that the Federal Government may make available to Members of Congress and congressional staff with respect to their service as a Member of Congress or congressional staff shall be health plans that are (I) created under this Act (or an amendment made by this Act); or (II) offered through an Exchange established under this Act (or an amendment made by this Act)."</ref><ref>{{Cite news |title=Congress Exempt from Health Bill? |first=Lori |last=Robertson |publisher=[[FactCheck.org]] |date=January 20, 2010 |url=http://www.factcheck.org/2010/01/congress-exempt-from-health-bill}}</ref>

====Exchange "death spiral"====

[[File:County By County Projected Insurer Participation in Health Insurance Exchanges.png|right|400px]]

Opponents claimed that combining immediate coverage with no provision for pre-existing conditions would lead people to wait to get insured until they got sick. They individual mandate was designed to push people to get insured without waiting. This has been called a "death spiral".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-01-18/the-once-and-future-obamacare-death-spiral|title=The Once and Future Obamacare Death Spiral|date=January 18, 2017|publisher=Bloomberg}}</ref> In the years after 2013, many insurers did leave specific marketplaces, claiming the risk pools were too small.

The [[median]] number of insurers per state was 4.0 in 2014, 5.0 in 2015, 4.0 in 2016 and 3.0 in 2017. Five states had one insurer in 2017, 13 had two, 11 had three; the remainder had four or more.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://kff.org/other/state-indicator/number-of-issuers-participating-in-the-individual-health-insurance-marketplace/?currentTimeframe=0 |title=Number of Insurers Participating in the Individual Health Insurance Marketplaces |publisher=Kaiser Family Foundation |date=January 30, 2017}}</ref>

In March 2012, the [[Roman Catholic Church]], while supportive of ACA's objectives, voiced concern through the [[USCCB|United States Conference of Catholic Bishops]] that aspects of the mandate covering contraception and sterilization and [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|HHS]]'s narrow definition of a religious organization violated the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] right to [[Free Exercise Clause|free exercise of religion]] and conscience. Various lawsuits addressed these concerns.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.usccb.org/issues-and-action/religious-liberty/march-14-statement-on-religious-freedom-and-hhs-mandate.cfm |title=March 14, 2012 Statement on Religious Freedom and HHS Mandate |date=March 14, 2012 |publisher=United States Conference of Catholic Bishops |access-date=April 28, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Goodstein |first=Laurie |title=Catholics File Suits on Contraceptive Coverage |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/22/us/catholic-groups-file-suits-on-contraceptive-coverage.html?_r=0 |newspaper=The New York Times |date=May 21, 2012}}</ref>

The Supreme Court ruled 7–2 on July 8, 2020, that employers with religious or moral objections to contraceptives can exclude such coverage from an employee's insurance plan. Writing for the majority, Justice [[Clarence Thomas]] said, "No language in the statute itself even hints that Congress intended that contraception should or must be covered. It was Congress, not the [administration], that declined to expressly require contraceptive coverage in the ACA itself." Justices Roberts, Alito, Gorsuch, and Kavanaugh joined Thomas' opinion. Justice [[Elena Kagan]] filed a concurring opinion in the judgment, in which [[Stephen Breyer]] joined. Justices Ginsburg and Sotomayor dissented, saying the court's ruling "leaves women workers to fend for themselves."<ref>{{cite web |last1=News |first1=A. B.

On June 25, 2015, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled 6–3 that federal subsidies for health insurance premiums could be used in the 34 states that did not set up their own insurance exchanges.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/supreme-court-upholds-obama-health-care-subsidies/story?id=31931412 |title=Supreme Court Upholds Obamacare Subsidies, President Says ACA 'Is Here to Stay' |last1=Taylor |first1=Audrey |last2=Seanz |first2=Arlette |last3=Levine |first3=Mike |publisher=[[ABC News]] |date=June 25, 2015 |access-date=June 25, 2015}}</ref>

====''House v. Price''====

{{Main|House v. Price}}

House Republicans sued the Obama administration in 2014, alleging that cost-sharing reduction subsidy payments to insurers were unlawful because Congress had not appropriated funds to pay for them. The argument classified the CSR subsidy as discretionary spending subject to annual appropriation. In May 2016 a federal judge ruled for the plaintiffs, but the Obama administration appealed.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/explainer/2017/apr/essential-facts-about-health-reform-alternatives-eliminating-cost|title=Eliminating Cost-Sharing Reductions in ACA|website=www.commonwealthfund.org|language=en|access-date=December 1, 2019}}</ref> Later, President Trump ended the payments.

====''United States House of Representatives v. Azar''====

{{Main|United States House of Representatives v. Azar}}

The House sued the administration alleging that the money for cost-sharing subsidy payments to insurers had not been appropriated, as required for any federal government spending. ACA subsidy that helps customers pay premiums was not part of the suit.

Without the cost-sharing subsidies, the government estimated that premiums would increase by 20 percent to 30 percent for silver plans.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.politico.com/story/2016/05/house-gop-wins-obamacare-lawsuit-223121 |title=House GOP wins Obamacare lawsuit |last=Haberkorn |first=Jennifer |date=May 12, 2016 |publisher=Politico |access-date=August 21, 2016}}</ref> In 2017, the uncertainty about whether the payments would continue caused Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Carolina to try to raise premiums by 22.9 percent the next year, as opposed to an increase of only 8.8 percent that it would have sought if the payments were assured.<ref>{{Citation |last=Sargent |first=Greg| author-link = Greg Sargent |title=Trump's latest tantrum will hurt hundreds of thousands of people.

U.S. District Judge [[Rosemary M. Collyer]] ruled that the cost-sharing program was unconstitutional for spending money that has not been specifically provided by an act of Congress, but concluded that Congress had in fact authorized that program to be created. The judge also found that Congress had provided authority to cover the spending for the tax credits to consumers who use them to help afford health coverage.<ref name="Denniston">{{cite web |url=http://www.scotusblog.com/2016/05/judge-billions-spent-illegally-on-aca-benefits/ |title=Judge: Billions spent illegally on ACA benefits |last=Denniston |first=Lyle |date=2016-05-12 |website=SCOTUSblog |access-date=2017-02-10}}</ref> The judge enjoined further cost-sharing payments, but stayed the order pending appeal, to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit]]. The case ended in a settlement before the Circuit Court.

====''California v. Texas''====

{{main|California v. Texas}}

Texas and nineteen other states filed a civil suit in the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas]] in February 2018, arguing that with the passage of the [[Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017]], which eliminated the tax for not having health insurance, the individual mandate no longer had a constitutional basis and thus the entire ACA was no longer constitutional.<ref>[https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.txnd.299449/gov.uscourts.txnd.299449.1.0.pdf]</ref> The [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] said it would no longer defend ACA in court, but seventeen states led by California stepped in to do so.<ref name="cnn 20181214" />

District Judge [[Reed O'Connor]] of Texas ruled for the plaintiffs on December 14, 2018, stating that the "Individual Mandate can no longer be fairly read as an exercise of Congress's Tax Power and is still impermissible under the Interstate Commerce Clause—meaning the Individual Mandate is unconstitutional." He then further reasoned that the individual mandate is an essential part of the entire law, and thus was not severable, making the entire law unconstitutional.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/421511-federal-judge-in-texas-strikes-down-obamacare|title=Federal judge in Texas strikes down ObamaCare|last=Sullivan|first=Peter|date=December 14, 2018|website=TheHill|language=en|access-date=December 15, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/federal-judge-rules-affordable-care-act-is-unconstitutional-11544838743|title=Federal Judge Rules Affordable Care Act Is Unconstitutional Without Insurance-Coverage Penalty|last=Armour|first=Stephanie|date=December 14, 2018|website=The Wall Street Journal}}</ref> Judge O'Connor's decision regarding severability turned on several passages from the Congressional debate that focused on the importance of the mandate.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://lawshelf.com/blog/post/federal-judge-in-texas-strikes-down-obamacare|title=Federal Judge in Texas Strikes Down "Obamacare"|website=lawshelf.com}}</ref> While he ruled the law unconstitutional, he did not overturn the law.<ref name="cnn 20181214">{{cite web | url = https://www.cnn.com/2018/12/14/politics/texas-aca-lawsuit/index.html | title = Federal judge in Texas strikes down Affordable Care Act | first1 = Ariane | last1 = de Vogue | first2= Tami | last2= Luhby | date = December 14, 2018 | access-date = December 14, 2018 | work = [[CNN]]}}</ref>

The intervening states appealed the decision to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit|Fifth Circuit]]. These states argued that Congress's change in the tax was only reducing the amount of the tax, and that Congress had the power to write a stronger law to this end.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/08/politics/affordable-care-act-court/index.html|title=Affordable Care Act gears up for momentous test in court|last=Biskupic|first=Joan|date=July 8, 2019|work=[[CNN]]|access-date=July 8, 2019}}</ref><ref name="wapost 20181214">{{cite web | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/federal-judge-in-texas-rules-obama-health-care-law-unconstitutional/2018/12/14/9e8bb5a2-fd63-11e8-862a-b6a6f3ce8199_story.html | title = Federal judge in Texas rules entire Obama health-care law is unconstitutional | first= Amy | last= Goldstein | date = December 14, 2018 | access-date = December 14, 2018 | work = [[The Washington Post]]}}</ref> O'Connor stayed his decision pending the appeal.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.cnn.com/2018/12/30/politics/judge-affordable-care-act-remain-in-effect-appeal/index.html | title = Judge says Affordable Care Act will remain in effect during appeal | first1= Kate |last1= Sullivan | first2= Tami | last2= Luhby | date= December 30, 2018 | access-date = December 31, 2018 | work = [[CNN]]}}</ref> The Fifth Circuit heard the appeal on July 9, 2019; in the interim, the U.S. Department of Justice joined with Republican states to argue that the ACA was unconstitutional, while the Democratic states were joined by the Democrat-controlled U.S. House of Representatives.

Democrats pointed out that the effect of invalidating the entire law would be to remove popular provisions such as the protection for pre-existing conditions, and that the Republicans had still not offered any replacement plan—important issues for the 2020 elections.<ref name="ollstein"/>

Under both ACA (current law) and the AHCA, CBO reported that the health exchange marketplaces would remain stable.<ref name="CBO_Score1" /> However, Republican politicians took a variety of steps to undermine it, creating uncertainty that adversely impacted enrollment and insurer participation while increasing premiums.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/27/opinion/health-care-obamacare.html|title=Opinion &#124; Killing Obamacare Softly|first=Thomas B.|last=Edsall|date=July 27, 2017|via=NYTimes.com}}</ref> Concern of the exchanges became another argument for reforms. Past and ongoing Republican attempts to weaken the law have included:
* Lawsuits such as ''[[King v. Burwell]]'' and ''[[House v. Price]]''. 
* President Trump ended the payment of [[Cost sharing reductions subsidy|cost-sharing reduction]] subsidies to insurers on October 12, 2017. CBO estimated in September 2017 that discontinuing the payments would add an average of 15–20 percentage points to health insurance costs on the exchanges in 2018 while increasing the budget deficit nearly $200 billion over a decade.<ref name="VoxCBO1">{{Cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/9/14/16308502/cbo-trump-obamacare-premiums|title=CBO: Trump is making Obamacare premiums more expensive|first=Sarah|last=Kliff|date=September 14, 2017|website=Vox}}</ref> In response, insurers sued the government for reimbursement.

Since most premiums are subsidized, the federal government would cover most of the increases. CBO also estimated that initially up to one million fewer would have health insurance coverage, although rising subsidies might eventually offset this. The 85% of enrollees who received subsidies would be unaffected. CBO expected the exchanges to remain stable (i.e., no "death spiral" before or after Trump's action) as the premiums would increase and prices would stabilize at the higher (non-CSR) level.<ref>[https://www.cbo.gov/publication/53009 "The Effects of Terminating Payments for Cost-Sharing Reductions"].
