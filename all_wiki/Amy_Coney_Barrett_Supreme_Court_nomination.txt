The death of Scalia in February 2016, the last year of [[Presidency of Barack Obama|Barack Obama's presidency]], meant that a successful nomination would replace a conservative [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]-nominated justice with a more liberal [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]]-nominated one. Obama's [[Merrick Garland Supreme Court nomination|nomination of Merrick Garland]] stalled as the Republican-held Senate, under Majority Leader [[Mitch McConnell]], refused to consider the nomination, which ultimately expired at the end of the [[Procedures of the United States Congress|congressional session]] in December 2016.

In refusing to consider Garland's nomination, Republican leaders cited a [[Biden Rule|1992 speech]] by then-chair of the [[Senate Judiciary Committee]]—since elected [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] and later 2020 presidential candidate—[[Joe Biden]] that if a vacancy occurred during that year's election campaign, the committee should not progress a nomination until after the election.<ref name=":0" /> In a March 2016 speech to [[Georgetown University Law Center]], Biden claimed Republican leaders were misinterpreting his 1992 remarks; he said that his "bottom line" at the time was that a [[Nomination and confirmation to the Supreme Court of the United States#Nominations in the last year of a presidency|nomination in an election year]] should still progress “if the nominee were chosen with the [[Advice and consent#United States|Advice]], and not merely the [[Advice and consent#United States|Consent]], of the Senate — just as the Constitution requires", and argued that the Senate had a duty to give an up or down vote to any such nominee, including Garland.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Biden|first=Joe|date=2016-06-01|title=Full Transcript: Vice President Joe Biden's Supreme Court Remarks at Georgetown University Law…|url=https://medium.com/@VPOTUS44/full-transcript-vice-president-joe-biden-s-supreme-court-remarks-at-georgetown-university-law-37ea18703d96|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201005175716/https://medium.com/@VPOTUS44/full-transcript-vice-president-joe-biden-s-supreme-court-remarks-at-georgetown-university-law-37ea18703d96|archive-date=October 5, 2020|access-date=2020-09-21|website=Medium|publisher=[[Office of the Vice President of the United States]]|language=en}}</ref> This argument was then relied upon by Republicans to justify the Senate holding a vote on President Trump's nominee to replace Justice Ginsburg.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.usnews.com/news/elections/articles/2020-09-18/bidens-2016-arguments-support-republican-vote-on-new-supreme-court-justice |title=Biden's 2016 Arguments Support GOP Vote on New Supreme Court Justice |website=US News |access-date=21 September 2020 |date=18 September 2020 |archive-date=September 20, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200920131114/https://www.usnews.com/news/elections/articles/2020-09-18/bidens-2016-arguments-support-republican-vote-on-new-supreme-court-justice |url-status=live}}</ref> In a speech to the same venue later in September of that year, Ginsburg also made an argument concerning the authority and duties of the President and the Senate when a Supreme Court seat is open in a presidential election year: "The president is elected for four years not three years, so the power he has in year three continues into year four.

McConnell said that, on October 19, "we will need all Republican Senators back and healthy to ensure we have a [[Quorum#United States|quorum]]."

As the questioning began on October 13, Barrett was asked whether ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'' had been wrongly decided.

[[File:Mitch McConnell and Amy Coney Barrett.jpg|thumb|right|Barrett with Senate Majority Leader [[Mitch McConnell]], September 29, 2020]]

U.S. Senate majority leader [[Mitch McConnell]] vowed to bring a Trump nominee to replace Ginsburg to a confirmation vote in the Senate. He distinguished the refusal of the Senate to allow a vote for Garland by stating that the Republicans successfully retaining control of the Senate in the [[2018 United States Senate elections|2018 elections]] gave them a mandate to fill a vacancy that Obama, in the last year of [[Lame duck (politics)|lame duck presidency]], did not possess:

{{Cquote
| quote = In the last midterm election before Justice Scalia's death in 2016, Americans elected a Republican Senate majority because we pledged to check and balance the last days of a lame-duck president's second term. We kept our promise. Since the 1880s, no Senate has confirmed an opposite-party president's Supreme Court nominee in a presidential election year. By contrast, Americans reelected our majority in 2016 and expanded it in 2018 because we pledged to work with President Trump and support his agenda, particularly his outstanding appointments to the federal judiciary. Once again, we will keep our promise.

Two Republican senators, [[Susan Collins]] of Maine and [[Lisa Murkowski]] of Alaska, said the Senate should not vote on Barrett's nomination until after the presidential election.
