'''Natural food''' and '''all-natural food''' are widely used terms in [[food labeling]] and marketing with a variety of definitions, often to imply foods that are not [[Ultra-processed food|ultra-processed]]. In some countries like the [[United Kingdom]], the term "natural" is defined and enforced;<ref name=":0">{{cite web|url=http://www.food.gov.uk/multimedia/pdfs/markcritguidance.pdf|title=Criteria for use of the terms Fresh, Pure, Natural Etc. in food labeling|publisher=[[Food Standards Agency]]}}</ref> in others, such as the [[United States]], it is not enforced although there is for example [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]] enforcement of [[Organic movement|organic]] labelling.<ref name=":1" />

==Definition by process and by product==

===United Kingdom===
In the [[United Kingdom]], the [[Food Standards Agency]] has published criteria for the use of several terms in food labeling. The [[guidance document|guidance]], in general, restricts the use of natural to foods that have "ingredients produced by nature, not the work of man or interfered with by man." [[Natural flavorings]] are explicitly defined by separate laws.<ref name=":0" />

There are different standards for various types of food, such as [[dairy products]].  It also gives standards for some food processing techniques, such as [[Fermentation (food)|fermentation]] or [[pasteurization]].  The standard explicitly rules out "foods derived from novel processes, GM or cloning."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.food.gov.uk/multimedia/pdfs/markcritguidance.pdf|title=Criteria for use of the terms Fresh, Pure, Natural Etc. in food labeling|publisher=[[Food Standards Agency]]|page=16}}</ref>

==Definition by process only==

===Canada===

The [[Canadian Food Inspection Agency]] restricts the use of "natural" to foods that have not been significantly altered by processing and gives examples of processes that do or do not significantly alter food.  This includes two specific additional requirements:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.inspection.gc.ca/english/fssa/labeti/guide/ch4ae.shtml|title=Guide to Food Labeling and Advertising, Chapter 4|publisher=[[Canadian Food Inspection Agency]]}}</ref>

*A natural food or ingredient of a food is not expected to contain, or to ever have contained, an added [[vitamin]], [[Dietary element|mineral nutrient]], artificial flavoring agent or food additive.
*A natural food or ingredient of a food does not have any constituent or fraction thereof removed or significantly changed, except the removal of water.

===Israel===

In Israel, natural ingredients are defined as part of the Labelling of Prepacked Food Standard (Israeli Standard SI 1145, which is legally binding).

The standard offers a list of 33 processes which are allowed in natural ingredients, all of which are physical treatments and not chemical modifications. These include blending, cleaning, [[Food extrusion|extrusion]], freezing, drying, etc.

A specific ingredient can be called "natural" if it didn't go through any processing except for the listed ones. The whole food can be called "natural" if the food is not a blend of foods (even if they are all-natural), has no added ingredients, and underwent only the specified processes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gain.fas.usda.gov/Recent%20GAIN%20Publications/Food%20and%20Agricultural%20Import%20Regulations%20and%20Standards%20-%20Narrative_Tel%20Aviv_Israel_7-26-2010.pdf|title=Food and Agricultural Import Regulations and Standards|publisher=US Department of Agriculture}}</ref>

==Lack of definition==

===United States===

[[Image:Foods.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The term “natural” is applied to many foods, but does not have a consistent meaning.]]

In the [[United States]], there are laws/regulations and agencies to protect the consumer when purchasing food products, specifically dedicated to the packaging and labeling. Some laws and organizations include the [[Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990|Nutrition and Labeling Education Act]], the [[Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act]], and the [[Food Safety and Inspection Service]] (FSIS).

FSIS is a subsection of the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] (USDA), which is tasked with the responsibility of "ensuring that the nation's commercial supply of meat, poultry, and egg products is safe, wholesome, and correctly labeled and packaged."<ref>Weaver, A. (2014). "Natural" Foods: Inherently Confusing. ''Journal of Corporation Law'', 39(3), 657-674. http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/99055404/natural-foods-inherently-confusing</ref> The USDA partnered with the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) to develop and issue regulations against the inappropriate usage of "natural" labels; yet, the FDA does not have specific rules for “natural" labeling. It advised on their website "the agency has not objected to the use of the term if the food does not contain added color, artificial flavors, or synthetic substances."<ref>FDA Basics, [https://www.fda.gov/aboutfda/transparency/basics/ucm214868.htm What is the meaning of 'natural' on the labeling of food]</ref>

Furthermore, the FDA has not developed any rules or regulations on the defining features of what qualifies a product as "natural." The FDA does reference a definition of "natural" in their informal policy (Ref. 53) that defines "natural" as "nothing artificial or synthetic (including colors regardless of source) is included in, or has been added to, the product that would not normally be expected to be there."<ref>Food Labeling: Nutrient Content Claims, General Principles, Petitions, Definition of Terms, 56 Fed. Reg. 60,421, 60,466 (Nov. 27, 1991) (codified at 21 C.F.R. pts. 5, 101, and 105), available athttp://foodrisk.org/default/assets/File/NLEA-Proposed-60421-60478.pdf</ref>

The [[Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act]] prohibits labeling that is false or misleading. The USDA has a standard for [[organic food]] called the [[National Organic Program]].<ref name=":1">{{cite web|url=http://www.ams.usda.gov/AMSv1.0/nop|publisher=AMS|title=National Organic Program}}</ref> As of August 2005, the USDA had a section governing "natural claims" in its Food Standards and Labeling Policy Book;<ref>[http://www.fsis.usda.gov/wps/wcm/connect/7c48be3e-e516-4ccf-a2d5-b95a128f04ae/Labeling_Policy_Book_082005.pdf?MOD=AJPERES] USDA Food Standards and Labeling Policy Book, USDA Food Safety and Inspection Service, August 2005</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=USDA Meat and Poultry Labeling Terms |url=http://www.fsis.usda.gov/wps/portal/fsis/topics/food-safety-education/get-answers/food-safety-fact-sheets/food-labeling/meat-and-poultry-labeling-terms/meat-and-poultry-labeling-terms/!ut/p/a1/jVJhb5swEP0r9AN8IzYlrdJJaEJMUZutSaNqK-HLZOAAV4CZfQS1v34c1bakStcaGZ_93ume35klLGZJK_ayFChVK2raJ5c_-ZZfelcRX22uvCW_Wf_Ybr5GEV_cX4yE3X8Ia_-D-W-MkL-Xv_pAgXN9G92WLOkEVq5sC8XiEtAVrRlAGxYXSuWuEQXgk1uIDF1TAeAfoBYp1LItWdyAoKzc7VRfo376C7kIujHvEx5YciyXe-N3s_bv59ertc8389eEE36-EN42bHSkrFU6NW8Xtqm_GK-uoQANetbr8bhC7D7Z3ObDMMxKpcoaZplqbD6in40I0NEZBo_Or0DqUrTyeXoNxvbOOSr6Q2t6DRTRjWkVLcpUKuwz2hUawDGq1xkEA6ROlgdzZw95wKOo3C4fwy_OWCogHbbnh2PKkibJKYw0s97kYhS2nw47KrzslEZRU0QMWlF1Mpuiw_5B3meTXAIOuvyad9Bngk55VSmDLD726BTPgNBZ1Qkt6A0cWWahsl7Mssgp659NFnnEuuZ7_PwtvObyrnlY4MUuPDv7DYq_KP0!/#14}}</ref> the USDA's regulatory jurisdiction applies only to meat, poultry, and egg products.

Because few regulations are governing the labeling of "natural" foods, manufacturers can include ingredients that may not be considered natural by some consumers.

The poultry industry has been criticized by the [[Center for Science in the Public Interest]] for labeling chicken meat "all-natural" after it has been injected with saline solution up to 25% of its weight. There is no legal recourse to prevent this labeling.<ref>[http://cspinet.org/new/201002241.html Salt-Water-Soaked Chicken Not at all Natural, Says CSPI] CSPI, February 24, 2010, </ref>

Although there are few legal U.S. definitions for natural foods, there are unofficial or informal definitions, none of which are applied uniformly to foods labeled "natural".
