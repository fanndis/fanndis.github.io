===Handelsblatt Today===

An English-language digital edition was launched in 2014, called ''Handelsblatt Global Edition'', which aimed to reach an international audience interested in German business and finance news.  It was published five days a week from its editorial office in Berlin with editor-in-chief, Kevin O’Brien at the helm.<ref>{{cite web|title="Handelsblatt" bringt englischsprachige Ausgabe an den Start|url=http://www.focus.de/regional/duesseldorf/medien-handelsblatt-bringt-englischsprachige-ausgabe-an-den-start_id_4208399.html|website=Focus Online|publisher=Hubert Burda Media|accessdate=7 July 2015}}</ref>  
In 2017, under a new editor-in-chief, Andreas Kluth, the publication avoided the direct translation of German-language articles and instead worked through differences between German and Anglophone journalistic traditions to add details that English readers were accustomed to.<ref>{{cite web | last = Kluth | first = Andreas | title = Farewell: What I learned about journalism while running Handelsblatt Today | website = Handelsblatt Today | publisher = Handelsblatt GmbH | date = 27 Feb 2019 | url = https://www.handelsblatt.com/today/opinion/farewell-what-i-learned-about-journalism-while-running-handelsblatt-today/24044312.html | archive-url = https://archive.today/20191205161119/https://www.handelsblatt.com/today/opinion/farewell-what-i-learned-about-journalism-while-running-handelsblatt-today/24044312.html?ticket=ST-12787944-06mAdKeIaNDxDWRP4XDI-ap4 | archive-date = 5 December 2019 | access-date = 5 Dec 2019 | url-status = live }}</ref>  The site was renamed ''Handelsblatt Today'' in 2018, but, unable to create a business model and reach a substantial audience to generate revenue, Kluth announced that publication would cease on 27 February 2019. <ref>{{cite web | last = Kluth | first = Andreas | title = Handelsblatt Today: About us | website = Handelsblatt Today | publisher = Handelsblatt GmbH | date = 1 Nov 2018 | url = https://www.handelsblatt.com/today/handelsblatt-today-about-us/23643540.html | archive-url=https://archive.today/20191205184127/https://www.handelsblatt.com/today/handelsblatt-today-about-us/23643540.html?ticket=ST-13202943-lwDUEf9E7Q6k3BXM4AP1-ap4 | archive-date = 5 December 2019  | access-date = 5 Dec 2019 }}</ref>
