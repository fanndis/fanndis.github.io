'''Ronald Pofalla''' (born 15 May 1959, in [[Weeze]]) is a [[Germany|German]] [[politician]] of the [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|CDU]] and a German [[manager]]. He was the [[German Chancellery Chief of Staff|Chief of Staff]] of the [[German Chancellery]] and a [[Federal Minister for Special Affairs of Germany|Federal Minister for Special Affairs]] from 2009 to 2013, in the [[Second Merkel Cabinet|second]] [[coalition government]] of [[Chancellor of Germany|Chancellor]] [[Angela Merkel]]. Since 2017, he is the CEO of [[DB Netze|the infrastructure department]] of [[Deutsche Bahn]].

==Early life and education==
Pofalla studied [[social pedagogy]] at the [[Fachhochschule]] in [[Kleve]]. After finishing with a [[Diplom]] in 1981 he studied [[law]] at the [[University of Cologne]]. In 1991 he passed the second [[Staatsexamen]]. Since that time Pofalla has been licensed to work as a [[lawyer]].

==Political career==
Pofalla has been a member of the [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|CDU]] since 1975.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} At first he was engaged in the [[Junge Union]]. He was chairman of the JU in the State of [[North Rhine-Westphalia]] from 1986 to 1992.

During his time in parliament, Pofalla served on the Committee for the Scrutiny of Elections, Immunity and the Rules of Procedure, the Committee on Legal Affairs, the Committee on Labour and Social Affairs and the Committee on Economic Affairs and Technology.

From 2004 to 2005 Pofalla was deputy chairman of the [[CDU/CSU]]'s parliamentary group in the [[Bundestag]] under the leadership of Angela Merkel, and served as the [[Secretary General]] of the CDU from 2005 to 2009. In the negotiations to form a [[coalition government]] of the Christian Democrats and the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] (FDP) following the [[2009 German federal election|2009 federal elections]], he led the CDU/CSU delegation in the working group on labour and social affairs; his counterpart of the FDP was [[Dirk Niebel]].

After the elections, Pofalla succeeded [[Thomas de Maizière]] as Chief of Staff to Chancellor Angela Merkel. During his time in office, he was repeatedly criticized for being rude towards other representatives of the Bundestag and other members of the German government. In September 2011 he seriously insulted [[Wolfgang Bosbach]], senior group leader of the [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|CDU]]/[[Christian Social Union in Bavaria|CSU]]-group in the Bundestag after an in-house discussion about the enhancement of the [[European Financial Stability Facility]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,789797,00.html |work=[[Der Spiegel]] |title=Merkel Ally Under Fire for Profanity-Ridden Tirade }}</ref>

In the negotiations to form a [[coalition government]] following the [[2013 German federal election|2013 federal elections]], Pofalla was part of the 15-member leadership circle chaired by Merkel, [[Horst Seehofer]] and [[Sigmar Gabriel]]. As part of a cabinet reshuffle, he subsequently resigned as head of the Federal Chancellery.<ref>Stefan Wagstyl

==Private sector==
In January 2014 it was reported that Pofalla would be joining the [[supervisory board]] of [[Deutsche Bahn]], the state-owned national rail network of Germany. He had previously worked for the company's subsidiary [[DB Netz]] between 2005 and 2009.

At Deutsche Bahn, Pofalla took up a “specially created lobbying post” said to carry compensation of more than a million euros a year.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/04/world/europe/german-politician-business.html |title=German Politician's Rush to Lobbying Brings Scorn |newspaper=New York Times |date=January 3, 2014 }}</ref> His successor in the Bundestag is [[Thorsten Hoffmann]].

After transitioning to the private sector, Pofalla was made co-chairman of the Petersburg Dialogue, a semiofficial German-Russian symposium.<ref>John Vinocur (November 2, 2015), [https://www.wsj.com/articles/europe-gives-up-on-hope-1446493932 Europe Gives Up on ‘Hope’] ''[[Wall Street Journal]]''.</ref> From 2018 until 2019, he also served on the German government's so-called coal commission, which was tasked to develop a masterplan before the end of the year on how to [[Fossil fuel phase-out|phase-out coal]] and create a new economic perspective for the country's coal-mining regions.<ref>Andreas Franke (June 6, 2018), [https://www.platts.com/latest-news/coal/london/germany-launches-commission-tasked-to-develop-26969439 Germany launches commission tasked to develop coal exit masterplan] ''[[S&P Global Platts]]''.</ref>

==Political positions==
During his time in politics, Pofalla took an active interest in [[Belarus]]. In 2012, he publicly condemned the execution of Vladislav Kovalyov and Dmitry Konovalov, both 26, saying this move would further alienate Belarus from Europe. "[[Lukashenko]] thus drifts even further away from our European values," he said. "The already heavily burdened relation between Belarus and Europe will be rendered yet more difficult by this."<ref>Luke Harding and Yuras Karmanau (March 18, 2013), [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/mar/18/belarus-executes-two-metro-bombing EU outraged after Belarus executes two men accused of Metro bombing] ''[[The Guardian]]''.</ref>

In the context of the Ukraine crisis, Pofalla has commented that “it wasn’t clever of Barack Obama to have downgraded Russia, in connection with the Ukraine conflict, to the level of a regional power.”<ref>John Vinocur (November 2, 2015), [https://www.wsj.com/articles/europe-gives-up-on-hope-1446493932 Europe Gives Up on ‘Hope’] ''[[Wall Street Journal]]''.</ref>

==Controversy==
Pofalla caused controversy when German [[Tabloid journalism|tabloid]] ''[[Bild]]'' revealed that he had bought premium [[Montblanc (company)|Montblanc]] writing materials worth 3,307.61 euros for his MP office at the expense of the [[Bundestag]] in 2009; at the time, it was the highest recorded order by any parliamentarian.<ref>Kate Brady (August 25, 2016), [http://www.dw.com/en/german-mps-expenses-to-be-reconsidered-following-stationery-scandal/a-19502121 German MPs expenses to be reconsidered following stationery scandal] ''[[Deutsche Welle]]''.</ref>
