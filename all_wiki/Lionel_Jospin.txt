'''Lionel Jospin''' ({{IPA-fr|ljɔnɛl ʒɔspɛ̃|lang}}; born 12 July 1937) is a French politician who served as [[Prime Minister of France]] from 1997 to 2002.

Jospin was [[First Secretary of the French Socialist Party|First Secretary of the Socialist Party]] from 1995 to 1997 and the party's candidate for [[President of France]] in the [[1995 French presidential election|1995]] and [[2002 French presidential election|2002 elections]]. In 1995, he was narrowly defeated in the second round by [[Jacques Chirac]]. In 2002, he was eliminated in the first round after finishing behind both Chirac and far-right candidate [[Jean-Marie Le Pen]], prompting him to announce his retirement from politics. In 2015, he was appointed to the [[Constitutional Council (France)|Constitutional Council]] by National Assembly President [[Claude Bartolone]].

==Biography==

===Early life===
Lionel Jospin was born to a Protestant family in [[Meudon]], [[Seine (department)|Seine]] (nowadays [[Hauts-de-Seine]]), a suburb of Paris, and is the son of Mireille Dandieu Aliette and Robert Jospin.<ref>https://maitron.fr/spip.php?article89780</ref> He attended the [[Lycée Janson-de-Sailly]] before studying at [[Sciences Po]] and the [[École nationale d'administration]] (ÉNA). He was active in the [[Union Nationale des Étudiants de France|UNEF]] students' union, protesting against the [[Algerian War of Independence|war in Algeria]] (1954–1962). He completed his military service as an officer in charge of armoured training in Trier, Germany.  Throughout his career his public image was, "dour, grumpy, rather cold, prone to temper and exasperation (‘austere’)."<ref>Gaffney, p. 314.</ref>

===Career===
After his graduation from the ENA in 1965, he entered the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (France)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] as secretary of Foreign Affairs. He became in charge of economic cooperation there, and worked with [[Ernest-Antoine Seillière]], future leader of the [[MEDEF]] employers' union.

Representative of a generation of left-wingers who criticized the old [[French Section of the Workers' International|SFIO]] Socialist Party, he joined a [[Trotskyist]] group, the [[Internationalist Communist Organization]] (OCI) in the 1960s, before entering the renewed [[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist Party]] (PS) in 1971. Joining [[François Mitterrand]]'s circle, he became the second highest-ranking member of the party in 1979, then its First Secretary when Mitterrand was elected president of France in 1981. When President Mitterrand decided, in 1982–83, to change his economic policy to give priority to the struggle against inflation and for a hard currency, Jospin justified his choice. After [[Laurent Fabius]] was chosen as prime minister in 1984, a rivalry between these two political heirs of Mitterrand broke out when they competed for the leadership of the [[1986 French legislative election|1986 legislative campaign]].

In 1988, after Mitterrand's [[1988 French presidential election|reelection]], Jospin left the PS leadership, and, though Mitterrand considered naming him prime minister, he was nominated for [[Minister of National Education (France)|minister of education]]. Under Jospin's tenure as education minister, teacher training was consolidated, the lycees and universities were reformed, teachers’ salaries improved, and technical and vocational education were reformed, which the socialists saw as a means of improving economic performance, tackling youth unemployment, and attaining social justice.<ref>{{Google books |id=NeSnLYEKPnYC |page=104 |title=Schools and Work: Technical and Vocational Education in France Since the Third Republic }}</ref>

Jospin's rivalry with Fabius intensified and caused an internal crisis, notably during the [[Rennes Congress]] (1990). The party's ''mitterrandist'' faction split because Jospin's followers allied with the other factions to prevent Fabius's election as First Secretary. This damaged Jospin's relationship with Mitterrand and, after the Socialist Party's failure in the March 1992 local elections, Jospin was not included in the new government formed by [[Pierre Bérégovoy]].

As a member of the National Assembly, Jospin served first as a representative of Paris (1978–86), and then of [[Haute-Garonne]] ''département'' (1986–88). He lost his seat in the National Assembly in the Socialists' landslide defeat in the [[1993 French legislative election|1993 legislative election]] and announced his political retirement.

In 1993, Jospin was appointed ''ministre plénipotentiaire'', 2nd class<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000000712585 |title=Décret du 1er mars 1993 portant nomination au grade de ministre plénipotentiaire de 2e classe (agents diplomatiques et consulaires) |language=fr |publisher=Legifrance.gouv.fr |date= |accessdate=2016-07-21}}</ref> (a rank of ambassador), a position he held until his appointment as prime minister in 1997,<ref>[http://legifrance.gouv.fr/jopdf/common/jo_pdf.jsp?numJO=0&dateJO=19970603&numTexte=&pageDebut=08860&pageFin=19970603 Decree of 2 June 1997] of president [[Jacques Chirac]] appointing Lionel Jospin Prime Minister</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000000551247 |title=Arrêté du 3 juillet 1997 portant détachement (agents diplomatiques et consulaires) |language=fr |publisher=Legifrance.gouv.fr |date= |accessdate=2016-07-21}}</ref> but he was not appointed to any embassy.<ref>[[Jean-Michel Aphatie]], [http://www.lexpress.fr/informations/comment-jospin-a-ressuscite-jospin_623024.html  ''Comment Jospin a ressuscité Jospin''], [[L'Express (France)|L'Express]], 5 June 1997</ref>

In 1995 Jospin claimed a necessity to "take stock" of the ''mitterrandist'' inheritance so as to restore the credibility of the Socialist Party. He was selected as the Socialist candidate for president against the PS leader [[Henri Emmanuelli]]. In the run-up to the election, Jospin made various policy proposals,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://miroirs.ironie.org/socialisme/www.psinfo.net/elections/president/1995/index.html |title=Élection présidentielle de 1995 |publisher=Miroirs.ironie.org |date= |accessdate=2016-07-21}}</ref> such as a programme for the environment, an extension of social services, a housebuilding programme, the rebuilding of run-down parts of cities, and a 37-hour workweek.<ref>The Mitterrand Years: Legacy and Evaluation edited by Mairi Maclean</ref>

Following the Socialists' landslide defeats of 1992–94, Jospin was considered to have little chance of victory. But he did surprisingly well, leading in the first round and losing only very narrowly to [[Jacques Chirac]] in the final runoff election. His performance was seen to mark a revival of the Socialists as a strong force in French politics and he returned to being the party's First Secretary.

Jospin built a new coalition with the other left-wing parties: the [[French Communist Party]], the [[Greens (France)|Greens]], the [[Left Radical Party]] and the dissident [[Citizen and Republican Movement]]. Two years later, Chirac decided to call an early election for the National Assembly, hoping for a personal endorsement. The move backfired: the "[[Plural Left]]" won a parliamentary majority and Jospin became prime minister.

Jospin is a Member of the [[Club of Madrid]].<ref>{{in lang|en}} [http://www.clubmadrid.org The Club of Madrid is an independent organization dedicated to strengthening democracy around the world by drawing on the unique experience and resources of its Members – 66 democratic former heads of state and government. ]</ref>

===Prime Minister===
Jospin served as prime minister during France's third "[[cohabitation (government)|cohabitation]]" government under President Chirac from 1997 to 2002.

Despite his previous image as a rigid socialist, Jospin sold state-owned enterprises and lowered the [[VAT]], income tax and company tax rates.

His government also introduced the [[35-hour workweek]], provided additional health insurance for those on the lowest incomes through the creation of [[Couverture maladie universelle]] (which made health care in France a universal right,<ref name="ReferenceB">Recasting Welfare Capitalism: Economic Adjustment in Contemporary France and Germany by Mark I. Vail</ref> and was regarded by Jospin and [[Martine Aubry]] as one of the "beacons" of their incumbency<ref name="ReferenceE"/>), promoted the representation of women in politics, expanded the social security system,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.issa.int/Observatory/Country-Profiles/Regions/Europe/France/Reforms2 |title=Reforms - ISSA |publisher=Issa.int |date= |accessdate=2012-11-27}}</ref> and created the [[Pacte civil de solidarité|PACS]] – a [[civil partnership]] or union between two people of any genders. During his term, with the help of a favorable economic situation, unemployment fell by 900,000. There were several women but no ethnic minorities in Jospin's government.

The "law against social exclusion" (1998) extended social security and introduced various measures to combat poverty. These included:

(1) The optimization of extra earnings for [[Revenu minimum d'insertion]] recipients.<ref name="ReferenceE"/>

(2) The introduction of [[Couverture maladie universelle|CMU]].<ref name="ReferenceE"/>

(3) Guaranteeing supplies of telephone, water, and electricity services for the impoverished, such as by paying off outstanding bills.<ref name="ReferenceE"/>

(4) Increased housing allowances and subsidized housing "concomitant with the introduction of a tax on unused apartments".<ref name="ReferenceE"/>

(5) Direct levels of assistance to groups with special problems in the labour market (including low-skilled persons, older unemployed persons, young people, and the long-term unemployed) through integration, internship, and continuing education programs, personal guidance and mentoring, and wage subsidies.<ref name="ReferenceE"/>

Continuous improvements were made in social benefits during Jospin's time in office,<ref name="newstatesman">{{cite web|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/200102260011 |title=The New Statesman Profile - Lionel Jospin |accessdate=2011-08-27 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110624075904/http://www.newstatesman.com/200102260011 |archivedate=June 24, 2011 }}</ref> together with increases in the minimum wage.<ref name="academia">{{cite web|last=Clift |first=Ben |url=https://warwick.academia.edu/BenClift/Papers/423161/The_Jospin_Way |title=The Jospin Way &#124; Ben Clift - Academia.edu |publisher=Warwick.academia.edu |date=2001-01-01 |accessdate=2012-11-27}}</ref> A 3% increase was carried out in the RMI and two similar minimum income guarantees in 1998, backdated a year,<ref name="academia"/> while expenditure on healthcare and education was increased.<ref name="ReferenceE">Social Democracy in Power: The Capacity to Reform by Wolfgang Merkel, Alexander Petring, Christian Henkes, and Christopher Egle</ref> A parity law was introduced that obliged every party to field an equal number of female and male candidates in national elections.<ref name="newstatesman"/> A decree was issued immediately after the start of Jospin's time in office that boosted the bonus paid to parents at the start of the school year from 420 to 1,600 francs for households with a monthly income of less than 11,600 francs.<ref name="ReferenceE"/>

Reductions were made in employee's health-insurance contributions, with employee premiums reduced from 6.75 to 0.75%. To compensate for lost revenues, the CSG was raised from 3.5% to 7.5%, while income from rent and capital was taxed more. This almost complete shift of employee's health-insurance contributions to the welfare tax CGT resulted in the purchasing power of employees rising by about 1%. Various measures were also taken to make the tax system more progressive. The Jospin government began taxing capital assets by introducing a tax on savings, particularly life insurance.<ref name="ReferenceE"/> A major reform of the welfare tax CSG was carried out, which doubled the welfare state's percentage share of taxes and resulted in an almost 10% fall in the share of contributions.<ref name="ReferenceE"/> Other measures included an increase in revenues from the wealth tax, a reduction in the lower marginal tax rate from 10.5% to 7%, a rise in taxation on profits from stock options from 40% to 50%, a 1997 increase in the exemption for the lowest tax bracket, a reduction in taxes on apartment sales, housing, and other fees, and the abolition of taxes on cars and roadways.<ref name="ReferenceE"/> In addition, income tax cuts were introduced in March and September 2000 that disproportionately favoured low and non-earners.<ref name="Clift"/>

An "employment premium" was introduced in 2002, similar to tax credits in the UK and US, providing a state subsidy to low-wage earners. Within a few years, eight million people had benefited from this scheme. Funds were provided for the renovation of public housing, while company pension savings plans were extended to cover small and medium enterprises. The Jospin government also made it possible for SMEs to jointly establish this kind of fund. A state-supervised reserve fund for old-age insurance was established, which created marginal capital coverage and was designed to protect pension levels from financial-market risks. Spending on education increased by 19% from 1997 to 2002, while spending on labour increased by 13% over that period.<ref name="ReferenceE"/> Social contributions for low-income workers were reduced,<ref name="ReferenceA"/> and a 5% increase in the RMI was carried out.<ref name="ReferenceE"/> A reform of women's rights and anonymous childbirth was carried out, together with a number of progressive educational reforms. These included the re-launching of the Educational Priority Zones, the establishment of the "Tourism And The Handicapped" ("Tourisme et handicap") programme, the implementation of language instruction as a priority in primary schools, the establishment of the "Plan Handiscole" for the education of disabled children and adolescents and their integration into life at school, the establishment of a national home-tutoring programme, and the introduction of local education and citizenship education contracts.<ref name="ReferenceC"/>

A wide range of child-centred policies were also implemented. These included the introduction of mandatory civics instruction in secondary schools,<ref name="ReferenceC">{{cite web|author=Webmaster |url=http://segoleneroyal2007.forumactif.com/t61-biography-of-segolene-royal |title=Biography of Ségolène Royal |publisher=Segoleneroyal2007.forumactif.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-27}}</ref> the introduction of financial support for child illness care together with parental time-off obligations, the introduction of special education support (parents d'enfants handicaps), a law against paedophile pornography, the establishment of a government student lunch programme, the launching of "Initiatives citoyennes" to teach children how to live together, the launching of a campaign against "hazing" of children, the creation of programs for parental involvement in schools together with national campaigns for the elections of parent-representatives, the passage of a law designed to safeguard children's rights and campaign against violence in schools, a law against the prostitution of minors that included penalties for clients, the establishment of the "Childhood and the Media" association against violence in the media<ref name="ReferenceC"/> and the creation of 40,000 new child-care places.<ref name="ReferenceD"/>

Improvements in the handicapped employment service COTOREP were carried out, while measures were introduced to upgrade handicapped access to public transport together with all types of buildings used by members of the general public.<ref name="ReferenceD"/>

The government established the right of an employee to take time off work if a child of the family was seriously ill.

A law passed in July 2000 on the organization and promotion of physical and sports activities emphasised the obligation to take into account the different types of disabilities in the organization of physical and sports education programs within educational and vocational training centers or special facilities. As a result of the legislation, sports specialists and teachers were required to receive an initial special training and continuing education to better facilitate the access of disabled persons to physical and sports activities. Laws were also passed in November 2001 and March 2002 that added to the list of grounds of discrimination physical appearance, sexual orientation, age, and genetic characteristics.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ideanet.org/content.cfm?id=5B5D75 |title=Compendium - France |publisher=Center for International Rehabilitation |date= |accessdate=2016-07-21}}</ref>

The 'social modernisation' bill included work-related provisions such as measures to combat 'moral harassment' (bullying) at work, measures to combat precarious employment (through restrictions on fixed-term contracts), and improved accreditation of vocational skills and experience. The law also contained a wide range of redundancy provisions such as the requirement to convene negotiations on the 35-hour week prior to any redundancy plan, enhanced powers for works councils, a contribution to the regeneration of closed sites by companies with a workforce of over 1,000, nine-month redeployment leave for redundant workers, and the doubling of the minimum redundancy compensation.<ref name="europa2002"/> A law on 'new economic regulations' was passed which aimed at adding an 'ethical' aspect to financial practices, "clarifying competition rules, improving social dialogue and enforcing the rights of consumers." In terms of industrial relations, the new law strengthened (to some extent) the powers of works councils in takeovers, mergers and proposed share exchanges.<ref name="europa2002"/> The Social and Medical Action Act, introduced in January 2002, provided additional protection for the rights of users of social and social/medical facilities.<ref>http://www.euro.centre.org/rescalingDocuments/files/France.pdf</ref>

A wide range of new social benefits were introduced, including the Allocation Specifique d’attente (ASA), an additional benefit for unemployed persons under the age of 60 who had contributed or at least 40 years to the pension insurance, l'allocation spécifique d'attente (APA), a home care allowance for the over-60's which made it possible for beneficiaries to spend their old age at home rather than in a care home,<ref name="ReferenceE"/> a benefit for seriously injured or sick children, and a benefit to encourage women to re-enter the labour market.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

An enhancement of the universal CMU health scheme was carried out, through the abolition of the spending ceiling for dentistry and the extension of the 'direct settlement' system for former benefit recipients whose income now exceeded the statutory ceiling.<ref name="europa2001"/> Paid paternity leave was introduced,<ref name="ReferenceA">{{cite web|url=http://www.kent.ac.uk/wramsoc/workingpapers/firstyearreports/nationalreports/francecountryreport.pdf |title=Welfare reform in France, 1985–2002 |accessdate=2011-08-14 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050502121521/http://www.kent.ac.uk/wramsoc/workingpapers/firstyearreports/nationalreports/francecountryreport.pdf |archivedate=May 2, 2005 }}</ref> and a law was passed to reform employee savings schemes The main purpose of this legislation was to increase the duration and scope of employee savings schemes, by extending them to employees of small and medium-sized businesses and increasing the 'lock-in' period for employee savings from 5 to 10 years.<ref name="europa2002">{{cite web|url=http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/eiro/2002/01/feature/fr0201100f.htm |title=2001 Annual Review for France |publisher=Eurofound.europa.eu |date= |accessdate=2012-11-27}}</ref>

The Jospin Government also established (within the framework of a policy to improve coverage for industrial diseases) of a compensation fund for asbestos victims,<ref name="europa2001"/> and extended the right to asylum.<ref name="Sowerine">France since 1870: Culture, Politics, and Society by Charles Sowerine</ref> A conditional amnesty for illegal immigrants was carried out, with some 75,000 obtaining legal residence as a result.<ref name="Sowerine"/> Measures aimed at reintegrating the very long-term unemployed into the workforce were strengthened in 1998,<ref name="europa1998"/> and emergency groups were set up that same year in each département coordinated by the senior local representatives of the government at département level (préfets), with the objective of examining individual payments to those most in need.<ref name="europa1998"/> An overhaul of housing assistance scales was carried out,<ref name="europa2001"/> and a law on gender equality at work was introduced. This legislation removed the ban on night work for women, and introduced new regulations for this type of work, with covered all employees.<ref name="europa2002"/> A social security funding law for 2002 was passed which, amongst other measures, provided a general rise in pensions and increased paternity leave (from 3 to 11 days).<ref name="europa2002"/>

Some structural barriers to employment were removed by making it easier to combine income from work with income from social transfers. Capital incomes were taxed more heavily, while various measures were introduced which benefited lower social strata and improved their purchasing power. Employees were the sole beneficiaries of lowered welfare contributions. Welfare benefits were raised, while income tax progression was increased, with tax cuts benefiting lower-income groups more strongly than higher-groups. Lower-income sections of the population received targeted support, and almost all tax measures introduced by the Jospin Government sought to stimulate demand and reduce inequality.<ref name="ReferenceE"/> Between 1997 and 2002, purchasing power as a proportion of household revenue from by 16%, the biggest five-year increase in over twenty years.<ref name="Clift">French Socialism in a Global Era: The Political Economy of the New Social Democracy in France by Ben Clift</ref> In addition, total government spending rose 8.9% from 1997 to 2002. Altogether, the social and economic policies implemented by the Jospin Government helped to reduce social and economic inequalities, with income inequality in terms of the [[Gini coefficient]] falling between 1997 and 2001.<ref name="ReferenceE"/>

In international affairs, Jospin mostly steered clear of foreign policy, but in 2000 he denounced [[Hezbollah]]'s "terrorist attacks against [[Israel]]i soldiers and civilian populations", a position markedly more pro-Israel than Chirac's. On 26 February, when Jospin visited [[Birzeit University]], Palestinian students threw stones at him, causing a minor injury.<ref>{{cite magazine |last1=Sancton |first1=Thomas |date=13 March 2000 |title=A Self-Inflicted Wound |magazine=Time|volume=155 |issue=10 |url=http://www.time.com/time/europe/magazine/2000/313/jospin.html |accessdate=8 November 2010 }}</ref>

===2002 presidential campaign===
Jospin was a candidate in the [[2002 French presidential election|presidential campaign of 2002]]. While he appeared to have momentum in the early stages, the campaign came to be focused mainly on law-and-order issues, in which, it was argued, the government had not achieved convincing results; this coincided with a strong media focus on a number of egregious crime cases. The far left also strongly criticized Jospin for his moderate economic policies, which they contended were not markedly different from that of right-wing governments favoring businesses and free markets. Jospin's 2002 presidential manifesto was nevertheless a strongly progressive one, calling for access to housing to be made a universal right, supporting employee representation on the supervisory boards of companies, and advocating better provisions for older people and the disabled.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://miroirs.ironie.org/socialisme/www.psinfo.net/elections/president/2002/documents/projet3.html |title=Élection présidentielle de 2002 - Projet de Lionel Jospin : Je m'engage |publisher=Miroirs.ironie.org |date= |accessdate=2016-07-21}}</ref> As noted by one observer, Jospin's manifesto sought to balance its emphasis on ‘inequalities in income’ with ‘equality of opportunity,’ eliminating poverty with special regard to housing whilst promoting social investment through (particularly) education.<ref>http://www.rose-hulman.edu/~casey1/BAB-Sloam.pdf</ref>

Many left-wing candidates contested the election, gaining small percentages of the vote in the first ballot that reduced Jospin's support. As a result, Jospin finished in third place, behind Chirac and narrowly behind the [[National Front (France)|Front National]] leader [[Jean-Marie Le Pen]]. He thus was not a candidate in the second round of voting.<ref>{{cite news |title=The Jolt In a Victory On the Right |first=Philip H. |last=Gordon |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/04/23/opinion/the-jolt-in-a-victory-on-the-right.html |newspaper=New York Times |date=23 April 2002 |accessdate=8 November 2010 }}</ref>

Following his defeat in April 2002, Jospin immediately declared he would leave politics and stepped down as prime minister. He has since sporadically commented on current political affairs; for instance, he declared his opposition to [[same-sex marriage]]. In 2005, he returned to the national political scene by campaigning forcefully in favor of the proposed [[European Constitution]].

In 2006, Jospin made it known that he was available to be the Socialist candidate for the [[2007 French presidential election|2007 presidential election]], but when [[Ségolène Royal]] became ascendant in the polls, he declined to enter the [[2006 French Socialist Party presidential primary|2006 primary]] in order not to "divide the party".<ref>{{cite news |title=Veteran French Socialist Steps Aside as Candidate for President |first=Elaine |last=Sciolino |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/29/world/europe/29france.html |newspaper=New York Times |date=29 September 2006 |accessdate=8 November 2010 }}</ref>

===Hollande presidency===

On 14 July 2012, President [[François Hollande]] announced that Jospin would lead a commission on deontology and ethics in French political life. This commission has been criticized for being too similar to the [[Edouard Balladur]] commission [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] created on the same topic in 2007. Some [[Union for a Popular Movement]] members also criticized the participation of [[Roselyne Bachelot]].

The commission was to give its recommendations by the end of the year.

==Trotskyist affiliation==
On 5 June 2001, Jospin acknowledged before Parliament that he had maintained links with a [[Trotskyist]] formation "in the 1960s" and with [[Pierre Lambert]]'s party (the [[Internationalist Communist Organization]], OCI) after joining the Socialist Party in 1971.<ref name=Monde02>''[[Le Monde]]'', 1 January 2002, "L'aveu de Lionel Jospin sur ses 'relations' avec une formation trotskiste</ref> While studying at the ENA, Jospin was recruited into the OCI by [[Boris Fraenkel]], one of the OCI's founders. He became an active member of the OCI under the pseudonym "Michel" after quitting the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in 1968. He declined to locate with precision his rupture with the Lambertists, but ''[[Le Monde]]'' alleged it was in 1986–87, a year before he became minister, while Lambert himself implicitly situated it in 1988.<ref name=Monde02/> Jospin said he had maintained only "private relationships" with OCI members after joining the PS.<ref>[http://www.rfi.fr/actufr/articles/018/article_8685.asp L'aveu de Lionel Jospin], ''[[Radio France International]]'', June 2002 {{in lang|fr}}</ref>

Jospin had concealed his relationship with the OCI while following a strategy of [[entrism]] into other parties, and specifically denied it when asked about it (claiming in 1995 that the rumor came from a confusion with his brother Olivier).<ref name=Monde02/> In 2001, investigative journalists and successive revelations by former Communist associates forced him to come forward.
