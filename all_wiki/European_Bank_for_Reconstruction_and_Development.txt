The '''European Bank for Reconstruction and Development''' ('''EBRD''') is an [[international financial institution]] founded in 1991. As a multilateral developmental [[investment bank]], the EBRD uses [[investment]] as a tool to build [[Market economy|market economies]]. Initially focused on the countries of the former [[Eastern Bloc]] it expanded to support development in more than 30 countries from Central Europe to Central Asia. Similar to other multilateral development banks, the EBRD has members from all over the world (North America, Africa, Asia and Australia, see below), with the biggest shareholder being the [[United States]], but only lends regionally in its countries of operations. Headquartered in [[London]], the EBRD is owned by 69 countries and two [[European Union|EU]] institutions, the 69th being [[India]] since July 2018. Despite its public sector shareholders, it invests in private enterprises, together with commercial partners.

The EBRD is not to be confused with the [[European Investment Bank]] (EIB), which is owned by EU member states and is used to support EU policy. EBRD is also distinct from the [[Council of Europe Development Bank]] (CEB).

==History==
The EBRD was founded in April 1991 during the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] by representatives of 40 nations from 3 continents and two European institutions, the [[European Investment Bank]] (EIB) and the [[European Economic Community]] (EEC, now [[European Union]] – EU), after reaching an agreement on the bank's charter, size, and distribution of power among shareholders.<ref>{{cite web|title=The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development|url=http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=5462&title=ebrd-emerging-issues-ldcs|work=Overseas Development Institut briefing paper|publisher=[[Overseas Development Institute]]|date=n.d.|access-date=28 June 2011}}</ref>

==Environmental sustainability==
The EBRD is unique among development banks for two reasons. First, it was the first multilateral development bank to have an explicit environmental mandate in its charter (since 1995),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ciel.org/reports/the-european-bank-for-reconstruction-and-development-an-environmental-progress-report-executive-summary-a-ciel-critique-of-ebrds-environmental-policies-november-1995-2/|title=The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development: An Environmental Progress Report, Executive Summary (A CIEL Critique of EBRD’s Environmental Policies) (November, 1995)|website=www.ciel.org|date=November 1995|access-date=20 February 2020}}</ref> and second, in that it will not finance thermal coal mining and coal-fired electricity generation due to their environmental impact.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/7d0814f0-fd6f-11e8-ac00-57a2a826423e|title=Development bank halts coal financing to combat climate change|website=www.ft.com|date=12 December 2018|access-date=19 February 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ebrd.com/news/2018/ebrd-puts-decarbonisation-at-centre-of-new-energy-sector-strategy.html|title=EBRD puts decarbonisation at centre of new energy sector strategy|website=www.ebrd.com|date=12 December 2018|access-date=19 February 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ebrd.com/what-we-do/sectors-and-topics/ebrd-energy-strategy-switch-coal.html|title=The EBRD's Energy Strategy and the switch from coal.|website=www.ebrd.com|access-date=1 October 2018}}</ref>

The EBRD had pledged, prior to [[Paris Agreement|2015 Paris Agreement]], to dedicate above 40 per cent of its financing to green investment by 2020. This goal was accomplished for the first time in 2017.<ref>Mahmood, M., & Orazalin, N. (2017).

==Mission==

The EBRD was founded to support countries of the former [[Eastern Bloc]] in the [[transition economy|process of establishing their private sectors]].<ref>{{cite web|title=About the EBRD|publisher=European Bank for Reconstruction and Development|url=http://www.ebrd.com/about/index.htm|access-date=2009-01-07 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080822231714/http://www.ebrd.com/about/index.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archive-date = 2008-08-22}}</ref> To that end, it offers "project financing" for banks, industries and businesses, for new ventures or existing companies.  It works with publicly owned companies to support their [[privatization|privatisation]], as advocated by the [[WTO]] since the 1980s<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/11649|title=State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring : Better Performance Through the Corporate Structure and Competition|first1=Muir|last1=Russell|first2=Soba|last2=Joseph|date=1 October 1995|access-date=17 August 2017}}</ref> and "improvement of municipal services".

The EBRD mandates to work only in countries that are "committed to democratic principles". It promotes "environmentally sound and sustainable development", and does not finance "defence-related activities, the tobacco industry, selected alcoholic products, substances banned by international law and stand-alone gambling facilities."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ebrd.com/downloads/research/factsheets/about.pdf|title=About the EBRD|date=2014-08-01|website=EBRD|access-date=2017-03-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170327165607/http://www.ebrd.com/downloads/research/factsheets/about.pdf|archive-date=2017-03-27|url-status=dead}}</ref>

==Criticism==
NGOs have criticised the EBRD on the lack of progress the EBRD makes in its main mission, the “transition towards open and democratic [[market economy|market economies]].”<ref name=EBRDmission>{{cite web|url=http://www.ebrd.com/pages/about/what/mission.shtml|title=Our mission|publisher=European Bank for Reconstruction and Development|access-date=2013-06-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130603202837/http://www.ebrd.com/pages/about/what/mission.shtml|archive-date=2013-06-03|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=bwthereyet>{{cite web|url=http://bankwatch.org/publications/are-we-nearly-there-yet-dilemmas-transition-after-20-years-ebrds-operations|title= Are we nearly there yet?

===Environmentally harmful projects===
Some [[NGO]]s have criticized the EBRD for financing projects they consider to be environmentally and socially harmful. Although it has increased its investments into [[Energy conservation|energy efficiency]] and [[sustainable energy]] in recent years, these NGOs consider the bank continues to diminish the impacts of green investments by financing carbon-intensive development such as coal, oil and gas production, transportation and generation, motorways, and airports.<ref name="bwebrd">{{cite web|url=http://bankwatch.org/our-work/who-we-monitor/ebrd|title= The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development|work= Central and Eastern European (CEE) Bankwatch Network|date=2011}}</ref><ref name=ciel>{{cite web|url=http://www.ciel.org/Publications/summary1.html|title= The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development: An Environmental Progress Report|work= Center for International Environmental Law|date=1995|author=Goldberg|display-authors=etal}}</ref>  Among the contested projects are the [[Ombla#Proposed power plant|Ombla power plant]] in [[Croatia]],<ref name=OSDI>{{cite web|title=Reviewing the evidence: how well does the European Development Fund perform?|url=http://www.odi.org/publications/7241-reviewing-evidence-well-does-european-development-fund-perform|publisher=Overseas Development Institute (ODI)|author=Mikaela Gavas|date=January 2013}}</ref><ref name=ombla>{{cite web|url= http://daily.tportal.hr/264455/HEP-and-EBRD-cancel-loan-agreement-for-Ombla-power-plant.html|title= HEP and EBRD cancel loan agreement for Ombla power plant|publisher= Daily.tportal.hr|date= 27 May 2013|access-date= 6 June 2013|archive-url= https://archive.is/20130710131356/http://daily.tportal.hr/264455/HEP-and-EBRD-cancel-loan-agreement-for-Ombla-power-plant.html|archive-date= 10 July 2013|url-status= dead|df= dmy-all}}</ref> the [[Kumtor Gold Mine]] in [[Kyrgyzstan]], and the [[Šoštanj#Power station|Šoštanj]] [[lignite]] power plant in [[Slovenia]].<ref name="bwebrd"/>

==Financing==
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2015}}
The EBRD offers loan and equity finance, guarantees, leasing facilities, trade finance, and professional development through support programs. Direct investments in equity range from 5% to 25% stakes<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ebrd-azerbaijan-privatisation/ebrd-mulls-taking-part-in-azeri-iba-sale-eyes-2-percent-gdp-growth-idUSKCN1G40YD|title=EBRD mulls taking part in Azeri IBA sale, eyes 2 percent GDP growth|date=2018-02-20|work=Reuters|access-date=2018-02-20}}</ref> and €5 million to €230 million. Smaller projects are financed both directly by the EBRD and through "financial intermediaries". The EBRD website states it has helped finance over 1 million smaller projects by supporting local commercial banks, micro-business banks, equity funds and leasing facilities.

To be eligible for EBRD funding, "a project must be located in an EBRD country of operations, have strong commercial prospects, involve significant equity contributions in-cash or in-kind from the project sponsor, benefit the local economy and help develop the private sector and satisfy banking and environmental standards."

The EBRD finances projects in sectors including [[agribusiness]], [[efficient energy use|energy efficiency]], [[financial institution]]s, [[manufacturing]], municipal infrastructure, also known as [[public works]] (which includes transport, schools, water supply, waste disposal, and pollution control services), [[natural resource]]s, power and energy, [[property]], [[telecommunication]]s, [[tourism]], [[transport]], [[information technology]].{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

===Central Asia===
In 2015, the EBRD invested a record amount in the Central Asian region. The total investment in 2015 rose by 75% reaching €1,402.3 billion. Kazakhstan reported the largest total volumes of investment reaching €790 million in 2015.<ref>{{cite web|title=EBRD investment in Central Asia reaches record €1.4 billion in 2015|url=http://www.ebrd.com/news/2016/ebrd-investment-in-central-asia-reaches-record-14-billion-in-2015.html|website=ebrd.com|access-date=23 February 2016}}</ref>

In the period 2009 - 2020, the ERD has invested almost €12.5 billion in various sectors of the Turkey’s economy, with almost all investment being in the private sector. The EBRD’s Turkey portfolio is the largest among the economies where the Bank invests.<ref name="Alternatif Bank">[https://www.ebrd.com/news/2020/ebrd-extends-funds-to-turkeys-alternatif-bank.html EBRD extends funds to Turkey’s Alternatif Bank]</ref>
