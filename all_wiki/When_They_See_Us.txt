==Premise==
''When They See Us'' is based on events of the April 19, 1989, [[Central Park jogger case]] and explores the lives of the five suspects who were prosecuted on charges related to the [[sexual assault]] of a female victim, and of their families. The five juvenile males of color, the protagonists of the series: Kevin Richardson ([[Asante Blackk]]), Antron McCray ([[Caleel Harris]]), Yusef Salaam (Ethan Herisse), Korey Wise ([[Jharrel Jerome]]), and Raymond Santana (Marquis Rodriguez)<!-- use full names for the youths -->, were divided by the prosecutor into two groups for trial. Each youth was convicted by juries of various charges related to the assault; four were convicted of rape. They were sentenced to maximum terms for juveniles except for  Korey Wise, who was 16 at the time of the crime and treated as an adult by the legal system. He had been held in adult facilities and served his time in adult prison.

They filed a suit against the city in 2003 for wrongful conviction and were awarded a settlement in 2014.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.thewrap.com/central-park-five-received-additional-3-9-million-settlement-from-new-york-in-2016-report/ |title=Central Park 5 Received Additional $3.9 Million Settlement From New York in 2016 (Report) |website=The Wrap |first=Jeremy |last=Fuster |date=June 9, 2019 |access-date=June 15, 2019}}</ref>

''When They See Us'' received widespread critical acclaim. On review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the miniseries has an approval rating of 96% based on 85 reviews, with an average rating of 8.4/10. The website's critics consensus reads: "Ava DuVernay pulls no punches in ''When They See Us'', laying out the harrowing events endured by the Central Park Five while adding a necessary layer of humanity to their story that challenges viewers to reconsider what it means to find justice in America."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/when_they_see_us/s01 |title=When They See Us: Season 1 (2019) |publisher=[[Fandango Media]] |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |accessdate=August 8, 2020}}</ref> On [[Metacritic]], it has a weighted average score of 86 out of 100, based on 27 critics, indicating "universal acclaim".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.metacritic.com/tv/when-they-see-us |title=When They See Us |publisher=[[CBS]] |website=[[Metacritic]] |accessdate=August 8, 2020}}</ref>

Daniel D'Addario from ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' mentioned in a glowing review of the miniseries, that "''When They See Us'' immerses viewers in a tale with none of the gaudy fun that true crime often offers. It's an achievement and, given its pride of place on a streaming service despite its difficult subject matter, a worthy use of its director’s star power."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://variety.com/2019/tv/reviews/ava-duvernay-when-they-see-us-1203220510/ |title=TV Review: Ava DuVernay's 'When They See Us' |last=D'Addario |first=Daniel |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=May 21, 2019 |accessdate=May 31, 2019}}</ref> ''[[Roger Ebert]]''{{'}}s Odie Henderson awarded the series a rating of 3 and 1/2 out of four stars, noting that "there’s a lot to recommend ''When They See Us''. It does as much as it can to recast the gaze on Black and brown people, eliciting empathy and the desire for justice. It demonizes the right people and demands your fury over the events presented."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/when-they-see-us-2019 |title=When They See Us Review |last=Henderson |first=Odie |work=[[Roger Ebert]] |date=May 30, 2019 |accessdate=May 31, 2019}}</ref> Daniel Fienberg from ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' recommended the miniseries in his review by highlighting that "''When They See Us'' is a rigorous attempt to chronicle an epic legal failure and to help restore a sense of the men as individuals, rather than faceless members of a wrongfully accused collective." Commending DuVernay's thematic and thoughtful approach to the subject matter and content, he adds that the series avoids the "typical triumph-over-adversity narrative tropes".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/they-see-us-review-1211524 |title='When They See Us': TV Review |last=Fienberg |first=Daniel |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=May 31, 2019 |accessdate=May 31, 2019}}</ref>

Matt Goldberg of ''[[Collider (website)|Collider]]'' gave it a very positive review, writing: "The emotional impact of ''When They See Us'' cannot be understated." He said further, "I watched ''[[The Central Park Five (documentary film)|The Central Park Five]]'' earlier this month, and it's a good way to understand the case and its basic facts, but even though [it] has interviews with all five men, it doesn't come close to what DuVernay does here with this cast, her craftsmanship, and Bradford Young's stunning cinematography."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://collider.com/when-they-see-us-review-netflix/ |title='When They See Us' Review: Ava DuVernay's Magnum Opus of a Broken America |last=Goldberg |first=Matt |work=[[Collider (website)|Collider]] |date=May 31, 2019 |accessdate=May 31, 2019}}</ref> Lucy Mangan from ''[[The Guardian]]'' complimented the miniseries, saying it is
{{quote|[A] dense, fast-moving series that examines not just the effects of systemic racism but the effects of all sorts of disenfranchisement (though you could argue they all have that same root cause) on people with the boys' background.

In a positive review of the miniseries, Jen Chaney from ''Vulture'' wrote that, "''When They See Us'', Ava DuVernay's sensitively wrought Netflix miniseries about what happened to those boys, strips away the dehumanizing tendency to bunch them together and instead shows what each of them dealt with individually when they were coerced into giving false confessions, forced to do time for a crime they did not commit, and, eventually, exonerated when their convictions were vacated in 2002."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.vulture.com/2019/05/when-they-see-us-netflix-review.html |title=When They See Us Is an Intimate, Sensitive Look at the Central Park Five Tragedy |last=Chaney |first=Jen |work=Vulture |date=May 30, 2019 |accessdate=May 31, 2019}}</ref>

Willa Paskin of ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' gave the series a positive recommendation, writing that "''When They See Us'' may be making an appeal to our duty to attend to this not-at-all-ancient history—but is not, itself, dutiful. In one aspect, in particular, DuVernay's approach is refreshingly unencumbered."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://slate.com/culture/2019/05/when-they-see-us-central-park-five-netflix-review.html |title=When They See Us Is a New Kind of Must-See TV |last=Paskin |first=Willa |work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] |date=May 30, 2019 |accessdate=May 31, 2019}}</ref> Robert Lloyd from ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' praised the series, stating that it is "a story about parents and children as much as it is about justice and race — the series has plenty of contemporary resonance on the latter account — and there is strong work from Niecy Nash, John Leguizamo, Aunjanue Ellis and Michael Kenneth Williams among the older generation."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/tv/la-et-st-when-they-see-us-review-netflix-duvernay-20190529-story.html |title=Review: Ava DuVernay's ‘When They See Us’ gets to the human heart of the Central Park Five |last=Lloyd |first=Robert |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=May 30, 2019 |accessdate=May 31, 2019}}</ref>

===Fairstein reaction and lawsuit===
[[Linda Fairstein]], the original New York prosecutor of the case, wrote of the Netflix series in an op-ed for the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' that it was "so full of distortions and falsehoods as to be an outright fabrication." The lawyer-turned-''New York Times'' bestselling author said she agreed with exonerations of the rape charges against the five — but said "the other charges, for crimes against other victims, should not have been vacated."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/netflixs-false-story-of-the-central-park-five-11560207823 |title=Netflix’s False Story of the Central Park Five |work=Wall Street Journal |first=Linda |last=Fairstein |date=June 10, 2019 |accessdate=June 15, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://nypost.com/2019/06/11/linda-fairstein-calls-netflixs-when-they-see-us-an-outright-fabrication/ |title=Linda Fairstein calls Netflix’s ‘When They See Us’ an ‘outright fabrication’ |work=New York Post |first=Lia |last=Eustachewich |date=June 11, 2019 |accessdate=June 15, 2019}}</ref> 

John E.
