'''Las Vegas'''  ([[Spanish language|Spanish]] for "The Meadows"), officially the '''City of Las Vegas''' and often known simply as '''Vegas''', is the [[List of United States cities by population|28th-most populous city]] in the [[United States]], the most populous city in the [[U.S. state|state]] of [[Nevada]], and the [[county seat]] of [[Clark County, Nevada|Clark County]]. The city anchors the [[Las Vegas Valley]] metropolitan area and is the largest city within the greater [[Mojave Desert]].<ref name="GR6">{{cite web|url=http://www.naco.org/Counties/Pages/FindACounty.aspx|accessdate=June 7, 2011|title=Find a County|publisher=National Association of Counties}}</ref> Las Vegas is an internationally renowned major [[resort town|resort city]], known primarily for its [[gambling]], shopping, fine dining, entertainment, and [[nightlife]]. The Las Vegas Valley as a whole serves as the leading financial, commercial, and cultural center for Nevada.

The city bills itself as [[The Entertainment Capital of the World]], and is famous for its mega casino-hotels and associated activities. It is a top three destination in the United States for business conventions and a global leader in the [[hospitality industry]], claiming more [[AAA Five Diamond Award|AAA Five Diamond]] hotels than any other city in the world.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/destinations/2013/08/21/top-50-destinations-for-meeting-planners/2681695/ | work=USA Today | first1=Charisse | last1=Jones | title=Top convention destinations: Orlando, Chicago, Las Vegas | date=August 21, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/dispatches/2014/01/17/aaa-five-diamond-hotels-restaurants/4496183|title=AAA chooses Five Diamond hotels, restaurants for 2014|author=Nancy Trejos, USA TODAY|date=January 17, 2014|publisher=Usatoday.com|accessdate=January 10, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hcareers.com/us/resourcecenter/tabid/306/articleid/1175/default.aspx|title=Top 5 Cities to Get Hired in Hospitality|publisher=Hcareers.com|accessdate=January 10, 2015}}</ref> Today, Las Vegas annually ranks as one of the world's most visited tourist destinations.<ref name="TravelandTourism">{{cite web

Las Vegas was settled in 1905 and officially incorporated in 1911. At the close of the 20th century, it was the most populated American city founded within that century (a similar distinction was earned by [[Chicago]] in the 19th century). Population growth has accelerated since the 1960s, and between 1990 and 2000 the population nearly doubled, increasing by 85.2%. Rapid growth has continued into the 21st century, and according to estimates from the [[U.S. Census Bureau]], the city had 651,319 residents in 2019,<ref name="City 2010">{{cite web| url=https://www.census.gov| title=Geographic Identifiers: 2010 Demographic Profile Data (G001): Las Vegas city, Nevada; count revision of 01-07-2018| publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]| accessdate=March 9, 2018}}</ref> with a metropolitan population of 2,227,053.<ref name="Census 2010">{{cite web| url=https://www.census.gov| title=Profile of General Population and Housing Characteristics: 2010 Demographic Profile Data (DP-1): Las Vegas city, Nevada| publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]| accessdate=March 9, 2012}}</ref>

As with most major metropolitan areas, the name of the primary city ("Las Vegas" in this case) is often used to describe areas beyond official city limits. In the case of Las Vegas, this especially applies to the areas on and near the [[Las Vegas Strip]], which is actually located within the unincorporated communities of [[Paradise, Nevada|Paradise]] and [[Winchester, Nevada|Winchester]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Vegas not alone in wanting in on .vegas  |author=Joe Schoenmann |author-link=Joe Schoenmann |newspaper=[[Las Vegas Sun]] |date=February 3, 2010 |url=http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2010/feb/03/vegas-not-alone-wanting-vegas/}}</ref><ref>{{cite press release |title=County Turns 100 July 1, Dubbed 'Centennial Day' |url=http://www.accessclarkcounty.com/depts/public_communications/news_releases/pages/countyturns100july1.aspx |publisher=[[Clark County, Nevada]] |date= June 23, 2009 |accessdate=February 5, 2010}}</ref>

Frémont]], whose writings helped lure pioneers to the area. Downtown Las Vegas's Fremont Street is named after him.

Eleven years later, members of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] chose Las Vegas as the site to build a fort halfway between Salt Lake City and Los Angeles, where they would travel to gather supplies. The fort was abandoned several years afterward. The remainder of this [[Old Las Vegas Mormon Fort State Historic Park|Old Mormon Fort]] can still be seen at the intersection of Las Vegas Boulevard and Washington Avenue.

Las Vegas was founded as a city in 1905, when {{convert|110|acre}} of land adjacent to the Union Pacific Railroad tracks were auctioned in what would become the downtown area. In 1911, Las Vegas was incorporated as a city.<ref>{{cite book | url=http://dwgateway.library.unr.edu/keck/histtopoNV/Origin_of_Place_Names_Files/1941NevadaOriginofNames-pt1.pdf | title=Origin of Place Names: Nevada | publisher=W.P.A. | author=Federal Writers' Project | year=1941 | page=16}}</ref>

1931 was a pivotal year for Las Vegas. At that time, Nevada legalized casino gambling and reduced residency requirements for divorce to six weeks. This year also witnessed the beginning of construction on nearby [[Hoover Dam]]. The influx of construction workers and their families helped Las Vegas avoid economic calamity during the Great Depression. The construction work was completed in 1935.

In late 1941, [[Nellis Air Force Base#History|Las Vegas Army Airfield]] was established. Renamed [[Nellis Air Force Base]] in 1950, it is now home to the [[United States Air Force Thunderbirds]] aerobatic team.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://afthunderbirds.com/site/|accessdate=25 October 2019|title=United States Air Force Thunderbirds|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191020032655/http://afthunderbirds.com/site/|archive-date=October 20, 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Following World War II, lavishly decorated hotels, gambling casinos, and big-name entertainment became synonymous with Las Vegas.

In 1951, [[nuclear weapons testing]] began at the [[Nevada Test Site]], {{convert|65|mi}} northwest of Las Vegas. During this time, the city was nicknamed the [[History of Las Vegas#Atomic testing|"Atomic City"]]. Residents and visitors were able to witness the mushroom clouds (and were exposed to the fallout) until 1963, when the [[Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty]] required that nuclear tests be moved underground.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.americanscientist.org/include/popup_fullImage.aspx?key=xi6i6nJGw4+EAIUukn0VVqyE9lgKboA6 |title=Cesium 137 deposition density resulting from the cumulative effect of the Nevada tests |last1=Simon |first1=Steven |last2=Bouville |first2=Andre |date=2006 |website=American Scientist |publisher=American Scientist.org |access-date=March 27, 2016 |quote="Deposition...generally decreases with distance from the test site in the direction of the prevailing wind across North America, although isolated locations received significant deposition as a result of rainfall."}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.americanscientist.org/include/popup_fullImage.aspx?key=xi6i6nJGw48vKULXvfEIZOOm8IOPKgCE |title=Wind shear (variations in wind speed and direction with altitude) causes fallout to spread over large areas. |last1=Simon |first1=Steven |last2=Bouville |first2=Andre |date=2006 |website=American Scientist |publisher=American Scientist.org |access-date=March 27, 2016 |quote="Trajectories of the fallout debris clouds across the U.S. are shown for four altitudes.

The iconic "[[Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas sign|Welcome to Las Vegas]]" sign, which has never been located within municipal limits, was created in 1959 by [[Betty Willis (artist)|Betty Willis]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/13/garden/13VEGA.html|title=A Neon Come-Hither, Still Able to Flirt|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=January 10, 2015}}</ref>

During the 1960s, corporations and business tycoons such as Howard Hughes were building and buying hotel-casino properties. Gambling was referred to as "gaming", which transitioned it into a legitimate business.

The year 1995 marked the opening of the [[Fremont Street Experience]], in Las Vegas's downtown area. This canopied five-block area features 12.5&nbsp;million LED lights and 550,000 watts of sound from dusk until midnight during shows held at the top of each hour.

Due to the realization of many revitalization efforts, 2012 was dubbed "The Year of Downtown." Projects worth hundreds of millions of dollars made their debut at this time, including the [[Smith Center for the Performing Arts]], the [[Discovery Children's Museum|DISCOVERY Children's Museum]], the [[Mob Museum]], the [[Neon Museum]], a [[Las Vegas City Hall|new City Hall]] complex, and renovations for a new [[Zappos|Zappos.com]] corporate headquarters in the [[Las Vegas City Hall (1973)|old City Hall]] building.<ref name="History"/><ref>Downtown Las Vegas Visitors Guide, 2014</ref>

On October 1, 2017, the deadliest [[mass shooting]] in U.S. history occurred in Downtown Las Vegas, when [[Stephen Paddock]] knocked out the window of his hotel room at [[Mandalay Bay]] before [[2017 Las Vegas shooting|shooting at the crowds]] of the [[Route 91 Harvest]] [[music festival]] across the street with multiple firearms, killing 60 people and injuring 411 others before he committed [[suicide]]. Paddock's use of [[bump stock]]s in the massacre led to them being [[Bump stock#Federal|banned]] by the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] in March 2018; the ban came into effect the following year.

The peaks surrounding Las Vegas reach elevations of over {{convert|10000|ft}}, and act as barriers to the strong flow of moisture from the surrounding area. The elevation is approximately {{convert|2030|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level. According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|135.86|sqmi|abbr=on}}, of which {{convert|135.81|sqmi|abbr=on}} is land and {{convert|0.05|sqmi|abbr=on}} (0.03%) is water.

After Alaska and California, Nevada is the third most seismically active state in the U.S. It has been estimated by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) that over the next 50 years, there is a 10–20% chance of a M6.0 or greater earthquake occurring within {{convert|50|km|abbr=on}} of Las Vegas.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://data.nbmg.unr.edu/Public/freedownloads/misc/Presentations/earthquakes/lossestimationmodeling23feb06.pdf|title=Loss-Estimation Modeling of Earthquake Scenarios for Each County in Nevada Using HAZUS-MH |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date= February 23, 2006 |website=Nevada Bureau of Mines and Geology |publisher=Nevada Bureau of Mines and Geology/University of Nevada, Reno |access-date=March 27, 2016 |quote="Probability of an earthquake of magnitude 6.0 or greater occurring within 50 km in 50 years (from USGS probabilistic seismic hazard analysis) 10–20% chance for Las Vegas area, magnitude 6" (p.65)}}</ref>

Within the city, there are many lawns, trees and other greenery. Due to water resource issues, there has been a movement to encourage [[xeriscaping|xeriscapes]]. Another part of conservation efforts is scheduled watering days for residential landscaping. A [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] grant in 2008 funded a program that analyzed and forecast growth and environmental impacts through the year 2019.

During the peak intensity of summer, overnight lows frequently remain above {{convert|80|°F|0}}, and occasionally above {{convert|85|°F|0}}.<ref name = "NOWData NWS Las Vegas, NV (VEF) - LASthr"/> While most summer days are consistently hot, dry, and cloudless, the [[North American Monsoon]] sporadically interrupts this pattern and brings more cloud cover, thunderstorms, lightning, increased humidity, and brief spells of heavy rain. The window of opportunity for the monsoon to affect Las Vegas usually falls between July and August, although this is inconsistent and varies considerably in its impact from year to year. Summer in Las Vegas is marked by a significant [[diurnal variation]]; while less extreme than other parts of the state, nighttime lows in Las Vegas are often {{convert|30|F-change|1}} or more lower than daytime highs.<ref>https://scholarworks.unr.edu/bitstream/handle/11714/2409/Sauceda_unr_0139M_11689.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y</ref>

Las Vegas winters are short and generally very mild, with chilly (but rarely cold) daytime temperatures. Like all seasons, sunshine is abundant. December is both the year's coolest and cloudiest month, with an average daytime high of {{convert|56.6|°F|1}} and sunshine occurring during 78% of its daylight hours. Winter evenings are defined by clear skies and swift drops in temperature after sunset, with overnight minima averaging around {{convert|39|°F|1}} in December and January. Owing to its elevation that ranges from 2,000 feet to 3,000 feet, Las Vegas experiences markedly cooler winters than other areas of the [[Mojave Desert]] and the adjacent [[Sonoran Desert]] that are closer to sea level. Consequently, the city records freezing temperatures an average of 16 nights per winter. However, it is exceptionally rare for temperatures to reach or fall below {{convert|25|°F|0}}, or for temperatures to remain below {{convert|45|°F|0}} for an entire day.<ref name = "NOWData NWS Las Vegas, NV (VEF) - LASthr"/> Most of the annual precipitation falls during the winter months, but even February, the wettest month, averages only four days of measurable rain. The mountains immediately surrounding the Las Vegas Valley accumulate snow every winter, but significant accumulation within the city is rare, although moderate accumulations do occur every few years. The most recent accumulations occurred on February 18, 2019 when parts of the city received about {{convert|1 to 2|in|cm|1}} of snow<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-vegas-snow-20190218-story.html|title=It just snowed in Vegas and likely will again this week.

According to research by demographer [[William H.

As of the census<ref name="GR2">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=January 31, 2008|title=U.S. Census website}}</ref> of 2010, there were 583,756 people, 211,689 households, and 117,538 families residing in the city. The population density was {{convert|4222.5|/sqmi|abbr=on}}. There were 190,724 housing units at an average density of {{convert|1683.3|/sqmi|abbr=on}}.

As of 2006, there were 176,750 households, out of which 31.9% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 48.3% were married couples living together, 12.2% had a female householder with no husband present, and 33.5% were non-families. 25.0% of all households were made up of individuals, and 7.5% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.66 and the average family size was 3.20.

In the city, the population age distribution was as follows:

* 8.8% from 18 to 24
* 32.0% from 25 to 44
* 21.7% from 45 to 64
* 11.6% who were 65 years of age or older

The median age was 34 years. For every 100 females, there were 103.3 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 102.5 males.

The [[Median household income|median income]] for a household in the city was $53,000 and the median income for a family was $58,465.<ref>{{cite web |author=American FactFinder, United States Census Bureau |url=http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/STTable?_bm=y&-geo_id=16000US3240000&-qr_name=ACS_2006_EST_G00_S1901&-ds_name=ACS_2006_EST_G00_ |title=Census |publisher=Factfinder.census.gov |accessdate=July 13, 2009 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20200212054817/http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/STTable?_bm=y&-geo_id=16000US3240000&-qr_name=ACS_2006_EST_G00_S1901&-ds_name=ACS_2006_EST_G00_ |archive-date=February 12, 2020 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Males had a median income of $35,511 versus $27,554 for females.

According to a 2004 study, Las Vegas has one of the highest divorce rates.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.citymayors.com/features/us_stresscities.html |title=Most Stressful US City |publisher=City Mayors |date=January 10, 2004 |accessdate=July 13, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Blakeslee |first=Sandra |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940CE5DB153FF935A25751C1A961958260 |title=Health: Suicide Rate Higher in 3 Gambling Cities, Study Says |work=New York Times |date=December 16, 1997 |accessdate=July 13, 2009}}</ref> The city's high divorce rate is not wholly due to Las Vegans themselves getting divorced. Since divorce is easier in Nevada than most other states, many people come from across the country for the easier process. Similarly, Nevada marriages are notoriously easy to get. Las Vegas has one of the highest marriage rates of U.S. cities, with many licenses issued to people from outside the area (see [[Las Vegas weddings]]).

==Economy==
The primary drivers of the Las Vegas economy are tourism, [[Downtown (Nevada gaming area)|gaming]] and conventions, which in turn feed the retail and restaurant industries.

The major attractions in Las Vegas are the casinos and the hotels, although in recent years other new attractions have begun to emerge.

Most casinos in the downtown area are located on [[Fremont Street]], with [[Stratosphere Las Vegas|The Stratosphere]] being one of the exceptions. [[Fremont East]], adjacent to the Fremont Street Experience, was granted variances to allow bars to be closer together, similar to the [[Gaslamp Quarter]] of San Diego, the goal being to attract a different demographic than the Strip attracts.

====Downtown casinos====
{{Main|Downtown (Nevada gaming area)}}
The [[Golden Gate Hotel and Casino]], located downtown along the Fremont Street Experience, is the oldest continuously operating hotel and casino in Las Vegas; it opened in 1906 as the Hotel Nevada.

====Las Vegas Strip====
<!--The Las Vegas Strip is not actually located in city limits. Please keep this section short-->
{{main|Las Vegas Strip}}
The center of the gambling and entertainment industry is located on the [[Las Vegas Strip]], outside the city limits in the surrounding unincorporated communities of [[Paradise, Nevada|Paradise]] and [[Winchester, Nevada|Winchester]] in Clark County. The largest and most notable casinos and buildings are located there.<ref name="LVS 2008-05-15">{{Cite news|url=https://m.lasvegassun.com/news/2008/may/15/evolution-worlds-entertainment-capital/|title=Showtime: How Sin City evolved into 'The Entertainment Capital of the World'|last1=Koch|first1=Ed|last2=Manning|first2=Mary|date=May 15, 2008|newspaper=[[Las Vegas Sun]]|access-date=3 March 2019|last3=Toplikar|first3=Dave}}</ref>

===Development===
{{See also|List of tallest buildings in Las Vegas}}
When [[The Mirage]] opened in 1989, it started a trend of major resort development on the Las Vegas Strip outside of the city. This resulted in a drop in tourism in the downtown area, but many recent projects have increased the number of visitors to downtown.

An effort has been made by city officials to diversify the economy by attracting health-related, high-tech and other commercial interests. No state tax for individuals or corporations, as well as a lack of other forms of business-related taxes,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lvrda.org|title=LVRDA|publisher=Lvrda.org|accessdate=January 10, 2015}}</ref> have aided the success of these efforts.

The Fremont Street Experience was built in an effort to draw tourists back to the area, and has been popular since its startup in 1995.

The city purchased {{convert|61|acre}} of property from the [[Union Pacific Railroad]] in 1995 with the goal of creating a better draw for more people to the downtown area. In 2004, Las Vegas Mayor [[Oscar Goodman]] announced plans for [[Symphony Park]], which could include a mixture of offerings, such as residential space and office buildings.

Already operating in Symphony Park is the Cleveland Clinic [[Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health]] (opened in 2010), [[The Smith Center for the Performing Arts]] (opened in 2012) and the DISCOVERY Children's Museum (opened in 2013).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://downtown.vegas/work/neighborhoods-districts/symphony-park/|title=Symphony Park, Las Vegas|publisher=Las Vegas Economic and Urban Development Agency|accessdate=April 8, 2016}}</ref>

On land across from Symphony Park, the [[World Market Center]] Las Vegas opened in 2005. It currently encompasses three large buildings with a total of 5.1&nbsp;million square feet. Trade shows for the furniture and furnishing industries are held there semiannually.

Also located nearby is the Las Vegas North Premium Outlets. A second expansion was completed in May 2015, with the mall currently offering 175 stores.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.premiumoutlets.com/lasvegas|title=Premium Outlets: Las Vegas|publisher=Premiumoutlets.com|accessdate=September 13, 2014}}</ref>

A new [[Las Vegas City Hall]] opened in February 2013 on downtown's Main Street. The former City Hall building is now occupied by the corporate headquarters for the major online retailer, [[Zappos.com]], which opened downtown in 2013. Zappos CEO Tony Hsieh has taken an interest in the urban area and has contributed $350&nbsp;million toward a revitalization effort called the Downtown Project.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.downtownproject.com|title=Downtown Project – Revitalizing Downtown Las Vegas|publisher=Downtownproject.com|accessdate=September 13, 2014}}</ref><ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/21/magazine/what-happens-in-brookley-moves-to-vegas.html]{{dead link|date=January 2015}}</ref> Projects funded include Las Vegas's first independent bookstore, [[The Writer's Block]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://knpr.org/knpr/2014-12/despite-e-books-independent-bookstore-gambling-downtown-las-vegas |title=Despite E-Books, Independent Bookstore Gambling on Downtown Las Vegas |publisher=Webcitation.org |accessdate=May 30, 2015 |url-status=unfit |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150530082035/http://knpr.org/knpr/2014-12/despite-e-books-independent-bookstore-gambling-downtown-las-vegas |archive-date=May 30, 2015 }}</ref>

===Other industries===

A number of new industries have moved to Las Vegas in recent decades.  Online shoe retailer [[Zappos.com]] (now an Amazon subsidiary) was founded in San Francisco but by 2013 had moved its headquarters to downtown Las Vegas.  [[Allegiant Air]], a low-cost air carrier, launched in 1997 with its first hub at [[McCarran International Airport]] and headquarters in nearby Summerlin.

[[Planet 13 Holdings]], a cannabis company, have opened the world's largest [[Cannabis shop|cannabis dispensary]] in Las Vegas at 112,000 square feet.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/02/planet-13-worlds-largest-cannabis-dispensary-opens-in-las-vegas.html|title=The world's largest cannabis dispensary just opened in Vegas—and it has an entertainment complex attached|last=Im|first=Jimmy|date=2018-11-03|website=CNBC|language=en|access-date=2019-06-25}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/15/18096082/planet-13-marijuana-dispensary-las-vegas-luxury-marketing-branding-cannabis|title=We visited the world's largest cannabis dispensary|last=Chen|first=Angela|date=2018-11-15|website=The Verge|access-date=2019-06-25}}</ref>

=== Impact of growth on water supply ===
A growing population means the Las Vegas Valley used 1.2 billion gallons more water in 2014 than in 2011. Although water conservation efforts implemented in the wake of a 2002 drought have had some success, local [[Water footprint|water consumption]] remains 30 percent more than in Los Angeles, and over three times that of San Francisco metropolitan area residents. The [[Southern Nevada Water Authority]] is building a $1.4 billion tunnel and pumping station to bring water from [[Lake Mead]], has purchased water rights throughout Nevada, and has planned a controversial $3.2 billion [[Water transportation|pipeline]] across half the state. By law, the Las Vegas Water Service District "may deny any request for a water commitment or request for a water connection if the District has an inadequate supply of water." However, limiting growth on the basis of inadequate water supply has been unpopular with the casino and building industries.<ref name=":0" />

==Government==
{{more citations needed section|date=May 2017}}
[[File:Lasvegasnewcityhall.jpg|thumb|[[Las Vegas City Hall]] in downtown Las Vegas]]
The city of Las Vegas government operates as a [[council–manager government]]. The Mayor sits as a Council member-at-large and presides over all of the [[city council]] meetings. In the event that the Mayor cannot preside over a City Council meeting, the Mayor Pro-Tem is the [[Chairman|presiding officer]] of the meeting until such time as the Mayor returns to his/her seat.

Inter-city bus service to and from Las Vegas is provided by [[Greyhound Lines|Greyhound]], [[BoltBus]], [[Orange Belt Stages]], [[Tufesa]], and several smaller carriers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kfhgroup.com/aibra/Tables/tables.htm|title=AIBRA – Nevada}}</ref> [[Amtrak]] trains have not served Las Vegas since the service via the ''[[Desert Wind]]'' at [[Las Vegas station (Nevada)|Las Vegas station]] was discontinued in 1997, but [[Amtrak California]] operates [[Thruway Motorcoach]] dedicated service between the city and its passenger rail stations in [[Bakersfield (Amtrak station)|Bakersfield, California]], as well as [[Los Angeles Union Station]] via [[Harvey House (Barstow, California)|Barstow]].<ref>{{cite web|title=California-Train and Thruway service|url=http://www.amtrak.com/ccurl/158/578/California-Thruway-Map-2012.pdf|accessdate=June 18, 2013}}</ref>

The [[Union Pacific Railroad]] is the only [[Class I railroad]] providing rail freight service to the city. Until 1997, the Amtrak ''Desert Wind'' train service ran through Las Vegas using the Union Pacific Railroad tracks.

A [[bus rapid transit]] link in Las Vegas called the Strip & Downtown Express (previously ACE Gold Line<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2010/aug/17/lawsuit-prompts-rtc-drop-ace-name-bus-lines/ |title=Lawsuit prompts RTC to drop 'ACE' name from bus lines |author=Green, Steve |date=August 17, 2011 |work=Las Vegas Sun |accessdate=March 1, 2011}}</ref>) with limited stops and frequent service was launched in March 2010, and connects downtown Las Vegas, the Strip and the Las Vegas Convention Center.

In 2016, 77.1 percent of working Las Vegas residents (those living in the city, but not necessarily working in the city) commuted by driving alone. About 11 percent commuted via carpool, 3.9 percent used public transportation, and 1.4 percent walked. About 2.3 percent of Las Vegas commuters used all other forms of transportation, including taxi, bicycle, and motorcycle. About 4.3 of working Las Vegas residents worked at home.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Census Reporter|title=Means of Transportation to Work by Age|accessdate=May 6, 2018|url=https://censusreporter.org/data/table/?table=B08101&geo_ids=16000US3240000&primary_geo_id=16000US3240000}}</ref> In 2015, 10.2 percent of city of Las Vegas households were without a car, which increased slightly to 10.5 percent in 2016. The national average was 8.7 percent in 2016. Las Vegas averaged 1.63 cars per household in 2016, compared to a national average of 1.8 per household.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Car Ownership in U.S. Cities Data and Map|journal=Governing|url=http://www.governing.com/gov-data/car-ownership-numbers-of-vehicles-by-city-map.html|accessdate=May 4, 2018}}</ref>

With some exceptions, including [[Las Vegas Boulevard]], [[Nevada State Route 582|Boulder Highway (SR 582)]] and [[Nevada State Route 599|Rancho Drive (SR 599)]], the majority of surface streets in Las Vegas are laid out in a grid along [[Public Land Survey System]] [[section line]]s. Many are maintained by the [[Nevada Department of Transportation]] as [[state highway]]s. The street numbering system is divided by the following streets:

* Westcliff Drive, [[U.S. Route 95 in Nevada|US 95 Expressway]], [[Fremont Street]] and [[Charleston Boulevard]] divide the north–south block numbers from west to east.
* [[Las Vegas Boulevard]] divides the east–west streets from the [[Las Vegas Strip]] to near the Stratosphere, then Main Street becomes the dividing line from the Stratosphere to the North Las Vegas border, after which the Goldfield Street alignment divides east and west.
* On the east side of Las Vegas, block numbers between [[Charleston Boulevard]] and Washington Avenue are different along Nellis Boulevard, which is the eastern border of the city limits.

Interstates 15, 515, and US 95 lead out of the city in four directions. Two major freeways – [[Interstate 15 in Nevada|Interstate 15]] and [[Interstate 515]]/[[U.S. Route 95 (Nevada)|U.S. Route 95]] – cross in downtown Las Vegas. I-15 connects Las Vegas to Los Angeles, and heads northeast to and beyond [[Salt Lake City]]. I-515 goes southeast to [[Henderson, Nevada|Henderson]], beyond which [[US 93 (NV)|US 93]] continues over the [[Mike O'Callaghan–Pat Tillman Memorial Bridge]] towards [[Phoenix, Arizona]]. US 95 connects the city to northwestern Nevada, including [[Carson City, Nevada|Carson City]] and [[Reno, NV|Reno]]. US 93 splits from I-15 northeast of Las Vegas and goes north through the eastern part of the state, serving [[Ely, Nevada|Ely]] and [[Wells, Nevada|Wells]]. US 95 heads south from US 93 near Henderson through far eastern California. A [[Las Vegas Beltway|partial beltway]] has been built, consisting of [[Interstate 215 (Nevada)|Interstate 215]] on the south and [[Clark County 215]] on the west and north. Other radial routes include [[SR 160 (NV)|Blue Diamond Road (SR 160)]] to [[Pahrump, Nevada|Pahrump]] and [[SR 147 (NV)|Lake Mead Boulevard (SR 147)]] to [[Lake Mead]].
