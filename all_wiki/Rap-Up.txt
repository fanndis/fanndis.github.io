'''''Rap-Up''''' is a [[magazine]] launched in 2001 by founder Devin Lazerine. The publication was originally a website devoted to [[hip hop]], until Lazerine decided to pitch the possibility of a magazine to several publishers. The magazine is focused on the hip hop and [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] aspect of the [[music]] industry, and predominantly features interviews with artists, actors and other entertainers. Issued quarterly, the magazine's target audience was the 14 to 28 demographic, although the demographic has become older over time.

The magazine's first two issues were one time deals, although Lazerine and his brother Cameron received attention for their age and white background. The magazine restarted publication in 2005, when it managed to sell enough copies to ensure future releases. The magazine is sold in more than 20 countries, and a separate handbook has been released, chronicling the history of hip hop. The magazine has been nominated for two awards, and is often referenced by other magazines.<ref name="aboutrap">{{cite magazine |url=http://www.rap-up.com/about |title=About Us |accessdate=12 January 2009 |magazine=Rap-Up}}</ref>

==Impact==
Bob Baker, the former publisher of H&S Media, praised Devin for having the "gumption to seek out publishers, to say 'I want to do this and how do I do it?' I focus more on his age than his race."<ref name="rapinfomag"/> Lou Pitt, a manager and producer of film and television, found that ''Rap-Up'' stood out from magazines ''[[Vibe (magazine)|Vibe]]'', ''[[The Source (magazine)|The Source]]'' and ''[[XXL (magazine)|XXL]]'' by showing the [[mainstream]] side of performers. Pitt said that the magazine is "not the street version [...] It has a very populist approach, in the way of [[People (magazine)|''People'' magazine]] or ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''."<ref name="rapinfomag"/> In 2003, Devin was included on ''[[Fast Company (magazine)|Fast Company]]''{{'}}s list of "Champions of Innovation whose achievements are changing companies and our culture".<ref name="rapweek"/> In 2006, the magazine was nominated for "Best New Consumer Publication" at the 55th Annual Maggie Awards.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-28781011_ITM |title=Another PodShow Exclusive: Giants of Rap |accessdate=12 January 2009 |date=December 1, 2006 |publisher=[[PR Newswire]] |url-access=registration }}</ref> In 2007, the website Rap-Up.com received a nomination for "Best Hip-Hop Magazine Site" at the [[Hip Hop Honors|Vh1 Hip Hop Honors]].<ref name="aboutrap"/>
