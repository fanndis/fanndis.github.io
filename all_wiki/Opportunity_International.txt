'''Opportunity International''' is a [[501(c)(3)]] [[nonprofit organization]] that is working to end global poverty by creating and sustaining jobs. Through a network of 47 program and support partners, Opportunity provides [[small business]] [[loans]], [[savings]], [[insurance]] and [[training]] to more than 14 million people in the [[developing world]]. It has clients in more than 20 countries and works with fundraising partners in the [[United States]], [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[Germany]], [[Switzerland]], [[Singapore]], [[Hong Kong]] and the [[United Kingdom]]. Opportunity International has [[501(c)(3)]] status as a tax-exempt charitable organization in the [[United States of America]] under the US [[Internal Revenue Code]] (Employer Identification Number: 54-0907624).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.irs.gov/Charities-&-Non-Profits/Search-for-Charities |title=Search for Charities |publisher=Irs.gov |date=2014-04-10 |accessdate=2014-06-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140607192610/http://www.irs.gov/Charities-%26-Non-Profits/Search-for-Charities |archivedate=2014-06-07 }}</ref>

==History==
In 1971, [[Al Whittaker]] left his job as president of [[Bristol Myers]] International Corporation in America to found the Institute for International Development Incorporated (IIDI), a micro-enterprise organization. Barry Harper, IIDI's first Executive Director, and development officer Dan Swanson together oversaw establishment of IDII offices in [[Colombia]], [[Peru]], [[Honduras]], [[Kenya]], the [[Dominican Republic]] and [[Indonesia]].

Australian philanthropist [[David Bussau]] founded Maranatha Trust and began administering loans in Indonesia in 1977. In 1979, he joined IDII as the director of the Indonesia office and began expanding IDII's work in Asia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://opportunity.org.au/what-we-do/about-us/david-bussau-and-our-history|title=David Bussau & Our History|website=Opportunity International Australia|accessdate=14 November 2017}}</ref>

In 1988, the two merged their efforts under the name Opportunity International. Since that time, the organization has continued to grow.

In 1991, a group of women supporting Opportunity International called the Women's Opportunity Network created a group-lending methodology called the Trust Group in which groups would be responsible for their peers and hold them accountable for repayment. Opportunity began testing this group lending and Trust Group method in the Philippines in 1992, and in the same year, they began to focus on serving entrepreneurs at even more extreme levels of poverty.

Realizing that no one group can tackle the issues of poverty alone, Opportunity began developing partners - independent, self-governing organizations with similar motivations - in countries and regions around the world. In 1998, Opportunity formalized these partnerships into the Opportunity International Network - a group of partners that now includes 47 entities in over 20 countries.

In 2000, Opportunity began building a series of permanent and mobile banks to reach more remote areas of countries and attempt to serve those that had previously lacked access to financial services. These formal financial institutions (FFIs) took the form of commercial banks, development banks or credit unions that could accept deposits, borrow money and/or accept investments.

In 2002, Opportunity International developed and founded [[MicroEnsure]], a microinsurance entity providing weather-indexed crop insurance, affordable health insurance, and protection against other risks. MicroEnsure was the world's first microinsurance intermediary and received a generous grant from the [[Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation]] in 2008. MicroEnsure spun off from Opportunity as its own company, and in 2013 it became a for-profit social enterprise.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://microensure.com/about-microensure/our-history/|title=History - MicroEnsure|website=Microensure.com|accessdate=14 November 2017}}</ref>

On January 24, 2006, David Bussau gave the 10th Australia Day Address with the subject "A Giving Nation." <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.australiaday.com.au/events/australia-day-address/david-bussau/|title=2006 speaker: David Bussau|website=Australia Day|accessdate=14 November 2017}}</ref> And in January, 2008, David Bussau was named Senior Australian of the Year 2008 for his work in the fight against global poverty.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.australianoftheyear.org.au/honour-roll/?view=fullView&recipientID=121|title=Australian of the Year Awards|website=Australianoftheyear.org.au|accessdate=14 November 2017}}</ref>

Al Whittaker passed away in 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/chicagotribune/obituary.aspx?n=alfred-whittaker&pid=19462079|title=Alfred Whittaker's Obituary on Chicago Tribune|website=Chicago Tribune|accessdate=14 November 2017}}</ref>

Opportunity was founded as and remains a non-denominational [[Christianity|Christian]] organization that serves all its clients regardless of their race, religion, ethnicity or gender.

In 2017, Opportunity International's operation in Malawi was sold to southern African banking group [[First Merchant Bank|FMB Capital]].

==How opportunity works==
===Trust groups===
Like many microfinance organizations, Opportunity often lends to clients through group lending. At Opportunity, these lending groups are called Trust Groups and consist of 10 to 30 [[entrepreneur]]s who pledge to guarantee each other's loans. The groups meet regularly to share personal and business advice, receive financial training and vote on loan-related topics.

Trust Groups are designed to build a safety net by guaranteeing each other's [[loans]] - if one member defaults on a weekly payment, everyone else must cover the costs. The idea is that the group guarantee replaces the need for [[collateral (finance)|collateral]], so that credit becomes available to those previously excluded from formal financial services.

Each week, as Trust Groups gather to repay their loans, Opportunity provides educational sessions to develop business skills and enhance personal growth.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.opportunity.org/our-work/trust-groups/ |title=Microfinance Support – Trust Groups &#124; Opportunity International |publisher=Opportunity.org |date= |accessdate=2014-06-11}}</ref>

The efficacy of group lending has been debated since it was first introduced by the [[Grameen Bank]] in the 1970s. As MFIs have become more advanced and increased their scale, it has become less costly for them to monitor borrowers, allowing them to be less reliant on group lending and peer enforcement. According to [[JPAL]], there is little evidence on the relative impacts of individual lending versus group lending on household consumption, income and enterprise creation.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.povertyactionlab.org/evaluation/group-lending-versus-individual-lending-mongolia|title=Group Lending versus Individual Lending in Mongolia - The Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab|website=Povertyactionlab.org|accessdate=14 November 2017}}</ref>

===Local staffing===
Today, Opportunity recruits and develops staff from the countries it serves. Its global team has grown to 23,000 employees, 99% of whom are nationals, with over 10,000 loan officers working directly with [[microfinance]] clients.<ref>[http://www.opportunity.org/our-work/local-staffing ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130911015028/http://www.opportunity.org/our-work/local-staffing |date=September 11, 2013 }}</ref>

===Technology===
Over the last 10 years, Opportunity has invested more than $20 million in electronic and mobile technology to reduce transaction costs and bring services to the most marginalized and remote people. Satellite branches and mobile banks reach clients in previously unserved areas, like rural farming villages and sprawling urban markets. [[Biometric technology]] provides convenient and secure access to finances, even for those who are illiterate or lack formal identification. Convenient [[automated teller machine|ATM]]s and [[point-of-sale]] (POS) devices offer the only safe method for transactions in many markets and allow clients to make transactions near home, thereby reducing transportation costs, improving their productivity and increasing the safety of their savings deposits. Over half of the developing world's population uses cell phones. Opportunity's banking programs enable clients to repay loans or transfer funds in Opportunity savings accounts from their mobile device. Cell phone technology gives clients in remote locations access to their accounts.

Opportunity's investment in mobile technology parallels a larger trend in the industry to utilize technology to improve microfinance and development initiatives. Mobile money, in particular, is transforming microfinance and banking around the world. In 2013, the total value of transactions made by mobile phones in Kenya was $24 billion - more than half the country's GDP.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/news/economic-and-financial-indicators/21618842-mobile-money-developing-countries|title=Mobile money in developing countries|website=Economist.com|accessdate=14 November 2017}}</ref>

Challenges of mobile money include security concerns and questions around regulation. As The Guardian notes, cooperation between the technology, policy and NGO communities will be critical moving forward.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2015/sep/24/mobile-money-apps-security-flaws-study-reveals|title=Mobile money in developing countries: study reveals security flaws in apps|first1=Patrick|last1=Traynor|first2=Kevin|last2=Butler|date=24 September 2015|accessdate=14 November 2017|website=Theguardian.com}}</ref>

===Investing in women===
According to UN Women, women make up 60% of the chronically hungry, more than two thirds of the world's illiterate population and receive lower wages for the same work.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unwomen.org/en/news/in-focus/commission-on-the-status-of-women-2012/facts-and-figures|title=Facts & Figures|website=Unwomen.org|accessdate=14 November 2017}}</ref> Opportunity focuses its services, including loans, savings accounts, insurance, training and financial access, on women - providing 95 of their loans to women. Research shows that women are far more likely to reinvest their earnings in their homes and families, extending the benefit of these services to the entire family. Studies suggest that women reinvest 90% of their income back into their families.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/ecosoc/phlntrpy/notes/clinton.pdf|format=PDF|title=Empowering Girls & Women|website=Un.org|accessdate=14 November 2017}}</ref>

===Initiatives===
====Education finance==== 

Opportunity EduFinance is a global program partner of Opportunity International, launched in 2007 and based in London UK. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://edufinance.org/about-us/our-origins|title=Our Origins|website=Opportunity International Edufinance|access-date=2020-01-14}}</ref>

More than 124 million children and adolescents around the world, half of whom live in sub-Saharan Africa, have never started school or have already dropped out.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uis.unesco.org/Education/Documents/fs-31-out-of-school-children-en.pdf|title=UNESCO UIS|website=Uis.unesco.org|accessdate=14 November 2017}}</ref>

Opportunity invests in parents and educators to help children go to school and receive a high quality education. Opportunity's EduFinance tools include: 
* School Improvement Loans - loans to school proprietors to help them build classrooms, install running water or bathrooms, or make other structural, resource or staff improvements to their facilities.
* School Fee Loans - loans to parents to help them pay school fees for their children on time that they can then pay back over the course of the semester. 
* EduSave Insurance - a program that covers children's school fees in the even of a death or illness of a child's guardian.

Alongside financial tools, Opportunity supports educators with other tools and programs including: 
* Education clusters - groups of leaders from up to a dozen schools that facilitate collaboration, group problem-solving and sharing of best practices. 
* School Assessments - helping school proprietors understand their strengths and weaknesses, as well as determining a clearly defined roadmap for improvements. 
* OPENeducator - a web-based resource center offering educators around the world training tools and a global community of support.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://opportunity.org/what-we-do/key-focus-areas/education-finance|title=Education Finance: Educating children living in poverty|website=Opportunity International|accessdate=14 November 2017}}</ref>

Opportunity has reached 1.7 million children and distributed $69M in education loans since 2009.

In October 2016, Opportunity announced that it received a $1 million grant to expand EduFinance from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://edufinance.org/blog/2016/10/opportunity-international-edufinance-receives-1-million-for-sector-innovation |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-02-14 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170215130204/http://edufinance.org/blog/2016/10/opportunity-international-edufinance-receives-1-million-for-sector-innovation |archivedate=2017-02-15 }}</ref>

In November 2016, Opportunity International won the Civil Society Achievement Honor at the Children and Youth Finance International Global Inclusion Awards 2016.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://edufinance.org/blog/2016/opportunity-international-wins-civil-society-achievement-honor-at-children-and-youth-finance-international-global-inclusion-awards-2016 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-02-14 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170215120441/http://edufinance.org/blog/2016/opportunity-international-wins-civil-society-achievement-honor-at-children-and-youth-finance-international-global-inclusion-awards-2016 |archivedate=2017-02-15 }}</ref>

====Agriculture finance====
One in four Africans - about 260 million people - suffer from hunger.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wfp.org/hunger/stats|title=Zero Hunger|website=Wfp.org|accessdate=14 November 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170212215604/http://www.wfp.org/hunger/stats|archive-date=12 February 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> Many of them are farmers operating at just 40 percent of their capacity. Farmers in the developing world face many challenges including: limited access to financial resources, high-quality farm inputs, markets and technical assistance and practicing side-selling to cover seasonal cash flows.

To address these and other challenges, Opportunity International has introduced the following programs, tools and initiatives: 
* Agricultural loans - using high-tech, low-cost banking solutions to deliver financial resources to rural farming communities. 
* Access to better resources - linking farmers to suppliers with high-quality seeds and fertilizers, and negotiating competitive pricing for farmers. 
* Agricultural Training - partnering with agricultural experts to deliver crop-specific training and assistance in good farming practices. 
* Savings accounts - empowering farmers to open savings accounts during harvest season to save profits for financial protection in between harvests, so they have money to meet basic needs. 
* Access to better crop markets - linking farmers to the best crop buyers where they can take advantage of better market prices.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://opportunity.org/what-we-do/key-focus-areas/agricultural-finance|title=Agriculture Finance: Tools and Microfinance for Farmers|website=Opportunity International|accessdate=14 November 2017}}</ref>

Agricultural lending is unique from traditional microfinance because the needs of farmers are unique. Research shows that client-centric, responsive approaches have enabled some MFIs to adapt to the needs of farm households and seasonal agricultures. Branchless banking and mobile money have also aided in advancing agricultural finance in rural communities.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.incofin.com/sites/default/files/attachments/publications/Microfinance%20and%20agriculture.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-02-14 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170215131013/https://www.incofin.com/sites/default/files/attachments/publications/Microfinance%20and%20agriculture.pdf |archivedate=2017-02-15 }}</ref>

===Partnership model===
Opportunity works through local program partners to better understand and meet the needs of families they serve. 
Local partners must share Opportunity's values and objectives. Their stated requirements for partners are:
* A primary objective of helping people out of poverty
* Work in the poorest, largely unserved regions wherever possible
* Operate within a market that exhibits a relevant gap, with conditions that are favorable for microfinance
* Sound strategies that show their continued intent to help people out of poverty
* A demonstrated commitment to meeting people's needs and having an impact

They also look for partners with:
* Excellent, inspiring leadership
* Strong risk management and governance
* A solid operating platform and capable staff
* Good financial performance and an ability to manage significant growth
* Comprehensive business plans and projections underpinning a sound future
* A history of financial self-sufficiency of, for start-ups, a forecast to be so within two years<ref>{{cite web|url=http://opportunity.org/what-we-do/microfinance/best-practice|title=Best Practice|website=Opportunity International|accessdate=14 November 2017}}</ref>

==Where opportunity works==
===About the Opportunity Network===
The Opportunity Network is made up of 47 organizations, 39 of which are [[microfinance]] institutions (program partners) operating in Africa, Eastern Europe, Central and East Asia and Latin America. These program partners provide loans and other support directly to families in need. Funds to support the work of program partners are raised through support partners operating in various countries including Australia, Canada, Germany, the United Kingdom and the USA. These funds are provided to program partners as either equity, loans or grants. While program and support partners have close relationships, each operates as an independent legal entity. No program or support partner acts as agent for any other program or support partner, nor has authority to bind any other program or support partner. Opportunity International was the first organization to approach microfinance using a microfinance network.

==Measuring impact==
===Social performance management===
In 2012, The Social Performance Task Force (SPTF) launched the Universal Standards for Social Performance Management. These standards incorporate the [[Smart Campaign]]'s Client Protection Principles and set standards on: defining and monitoring social goals, governance, treatment of clients, development of products and services, treatment of employees, and balancing financial and social performance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sptf.info/|title=Home|website=sptf.info|accessdate=14 November 2017}}</ref>

Opportunity's Social Performance Management (SPM) program is used in India, the Philippines and an expanding number of countries in Africa, Eastern Europe and Latin America.

The Progress Out of Poverty Index (PPI) scorecard is a tool that helps monitor the effects of microfinance on income levels. The scorecard includes simple questions related to the client's income level, such as:

* What are the outer walls of your house made of? 
* What kind of toilet facility does your family have?
* What is your main source of drinking water?
* What is the main source of lighting for your home?

By assessing the answers to questions such as these, it is possible to gauge the relative income level and poverty status of a family and help ensure they are receiving benefits from interventions in various areas of their life.

Opportunity has also piloted the Social Return on Investment (SROI) methodology in both India and the Philippines. SROI is a framework for measuring and accounting for the value added to the lives of families served, looking at social, environmental and economic benefits of microfinance and then quantifying the amount of change that has taken place.

===Challenges of measuring impact===
There is no evidence presented in Opportunity International (OI) publications of summary-level improvements in household income or jobs created by OI's borrowers.  This is not surprising, since scientific testing of the impact of microcredit is surprisingly difficult.  Dozens of studies have looked at the experience of people who received microloans.  The challenge has been to identify a control group for comparison: it is difficult and expensive to find a group of people who are like the loan recipients in all relevant ways except for not having gotten a loan. Two studies looked at standard microcredit clients over a short period (12–18 months) using randomized controlled trials found no evidence of improvements in household income or consumption.  For now, it seems an honest summary of the evidence to say that we simply do not know yet whether microcredit or other forms of microfinance are helping to lift millions out of poverty.<ref>Rosenberg, Richard. (2010) Does Microcredit Really Help Poor People? Consultive Group to Assist the Poor, Focus Note Number 59, 1.</ref>

Further, one of the least remarked-on problems facing the world's poor living on two dollars a day is that they do not literally get that amount each day.  In other words, economic poverty is not just a matter of low incomes, but also of irregular and uncertain incomes.  To put food on the table every day and meet other basic consumption needs, poor households have to save and borrow constantly.<ref>Collins, D., Morduch, J., Rutherford, S., and Ruthven, O. (2009). Portfolios of the Poor: How the World's Poor Live on $2 a Day.  Princeton:  Princeton University Press.</ref>  One research team presented results of year-long financial diaries collected about twice a month from hundreds of rural and urban households in India, Bangladesh, and South Africa.  They consistently found the poor use credit and savings to [[consumption smoothing|smooth consumption]], to deal with emergencies like health problems and to accumulate the larger sums they need to seize opportunities—occasionally business opportunities—and pay for big-ticket expenses like education, weddings and funerals.<ref>Collins, D., Morduch, J., Rutherford, S., and Ruthven, O. (2009). Portfolios of the Poor: How the World's Poor Live on $2 a Day. Princeton: Princeton University Press.</ref> Over the year, the average diary household used 8 to 10 different types of financial instruments; most types were used multiple times.  The notion that microcredit brings loans to people who previously had no access to them is widespread but mistaken, as is the notion that the strong majority of microloans are used for business purposes.<ref>Bourdreaux, K., and Cowen, T. (2008). The Micromagic of Microcredit. Wilson Quarterly, 64.</ref>

Finally, it seems unlikely that a year of microlending helps poor people as much as a year of girls' primary education, for example.  The true advantage of microfinance is not that each "dose" is more powerful, but rather that each dose costs much less than subsidies.  Social programs like primary education and health care usually require large continuing subsidies, using up scarce tax dollars year after year.  Microfinancing is different:  when it is done right, relatively small up-front subsidies lead to permanent institutions that can continue providing services year after year with no further subsidy needed, and can expand those services to reach many millions of low-income clients.<ref>Rosenberg, R. (2010). Does Microcredit Really Help Poor People? Consultive Group to Assist the Poor, Focus Note Number 59, 1.</ref>
