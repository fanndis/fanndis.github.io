==Overview==
An article in [[Success (magazine)|''Success'']] magazine describes ''A New Earth'' as a "self-improvement book" that encourages its readers to live their lives in each present moment and to create happiness for themselves without emphasizing material possessions.<ref name="Success"/>  Tolle's intent is to change the way human beings think, and he envisions a world population that is increasingly humble, enlightened and pure.<ref name="Success"/> According to Tolle, the book's purpose "is not to add new information or beliefs to your mind or to try to convince you of anything, but to bring about a shift in consciousness".<ref>{{cite book | title=A New Earth | publisher=Penguin Group | author=Tolle, Eckhart | year=2005 | pages=6–7}}</ref>

In the book,  Tolle asserts that everyone can find "the freedom and joy of life" if they live in the present moment.<ref name="Whetsell">{{cite web|url=http://www.nysna.org/images/pdfs/communications/journal/spg_smr08.pdf |title=A New Earth: Awakening to Your Life's Purpose.(Book review) |publisher=Journal of the New York State Nurses Association |date=March 22, 2008 |accessdate=August 4, 2013 |author=Whetsell, Martha V. |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101127180223/http://nysna.org/images/pdfs/communications/journal/spg_smr08.pdf |archivedate=November 27, 2010 }}</ref> The book describes human dysfunction, selfishness, anxiety and the inhumanity we inflict on each other, as well as mankind's failed attempts to find life meaning and purpose through material possessions and unhealthy relationships.<ref name="CS Monitor"/>  It asserts that thoughts can have a powerful and beneficial "effect on the healing process",<ref name="Whetsell"/> and puts forth a concept of "evolutionary transformation of human consciousness" which prompts the reader to participate in "honest self-evaluation [that] can lead to positive change."<ref name="Whetsell"/>

==Synopsis==
Early chapters of the book give simple explanations and provide a foundation for further concepts and ideas.<ref name="Success"/> In "Chapter One: The Flowering of Human Consciousness", Tolle discusses the "inherent dysfunction in humanity" and proposes ways that readers may rise above it.<ref name="Success"/>  He then develops these concepts in chapters two, three and four by offering his descriptions of the ego and its "vices."<ref name="Success"/> In the book, Tolle defines the term ego as an "illusory sense of self"<ref>Tolle, Echart (2005) Penguin Group, ''A New Earth'', p. 27</ref> based on one's memories and thoughts.<ref>Tolle, ''A New Earth'', p. 29</ref>  In chapters five and six Tolle uses the phrase ''pain body'' to describe the human tendency to carry "an accumulation of old emotional pain".<ref>Tolle, Eckhart (2005) Penguin Group, ''A New Earth'',  p. 140</ref> In chapters seven, eight and nine: "Inner Space, Inner Purpose and Who You Truly Are", Tolle makes many distinctions: between "knowing yourself and knowing about yourself"; between the "Dreamer" and the "dream"; between the objects of consciousness and the space of consciousness; between outer space and inner space; and between outer purpose and inner purpose. In chapter ten, "A New Earth", Tolle gives his readers suggestions for implementation of his ideas in their personal life but cautions them by saying:  "You are still an ordinary human. What is extraordinary is what comes through you into this world".<ref name="Success"/>
