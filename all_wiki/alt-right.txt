The '''alt-right''' (abbreviated from '''alternative right''') is a loosely connected [[far-right]] and [[white nationalist]] movement. A largely [[Internet activism|online phenomenon]], the alt-right originated in the U.S. during the 2010s, although it has since established a presence in various other countries. The term is ill-defined, having been used in different ways by various self-described "alt-rightists", media commentators, and academics. Groups which have been identified as alt-right also espouse [[white supremacism]], [[white separatism]], [[right-wing populism]], [[anti-immigration]], [[racism]], [[anti-communism]], [[anti-Zionism]], [[antisemitism]], [[Holocaust denial]], [[xenophobia]], [[anti-intellectualism]], [[antifeminism]], [[homophobia]], and [[Islamophobia]].

In 2010, the American white nationalist [[Richard B. Spencer]] launched ''The Alternative Right'' [[webzine]]. His "alternative right" was influenced by earlier forms of American white nationalism, as well as [[paleoconservatism]], the [[Dark Enlightenment]], and the [[Nouvelle Droite]]. His term was shortened to "alt-right" and popularised by far-right participants of [[/pol/]], the politics board of web forum [[4chan]]. It came to be associated with other white nationalist websites and groups, including Andrew Anglin's ''[[Daily Stormer]]'', Brad Griffin's ''Occidental Dissent'', and Matthew Heimbach's [[Traditionalist Worker Party]]. Following the 2014 [[Gamergate controversy]], the alt-right made increasing use of [[Internet troll|trolling]] and [[online harassment]] to raise its profile. In 2015, it attracted broader attention—particularly through coverage on [[Steve Bannon]]'s [[Breitbart News]]—due to alt-right support for [[Donald Trump]]'s [[Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign|2016 presidential campaign]].  On [[2016 United States presidential election|being elected]], Trump disavowed the movement. Attempting to move from a web-based to a street-based movement, Spencer and other alt-rightists organised the August 2017 [[Unite the Right rally]] in [[Charlottesville, Virginia]], which faced significant [[Anti-fascism|anti-fascist]] opposition. After this, the movement began to decline.

The alt-right is a [[biologically racist]] movement promoting a form of far-right [[identity politics]] for [[European Americans]]. Part of its membership supports tight immigration restrictions policies to ensure a continued white majority in the U.S. Others call for the breakup of the country to form a white separatist [[ethno-state]] in [[North America]]. Some alt-rightists seek to make white nationalism socially respectable in the U.S. while others, known as the "[[Fourteen Words|1488]]" scene, adopt openly white supremacist and [[neo-Nazism|neo-Nazi]] stances with the intent to shock and provoke. Some alt-rightists are antisemitic, promoting a [[conspiracy theory]] that there is [[Zionist Occupation Government conspiracy theory|a Jewish plot]] to bring about [[White genocide conspiracy theory|white genocide]], though other alt-rightists view most Jews as members of the white race. The alt-right is anti-feminist, advocates for a more [[Patriarchy|patriarchal society]], and intersects with the [[men's rights movement]] and other sectors of what has been called the online [[manosphere]]. Alt-rightists generally support [[anti-interventionist]] and [[isolationist]] foreign policies alongside [[economic protectionism]]. Individuals aligned with many of the alt-right's ideas but not its white nationalism have been termed "[[alt-lite]]".

The alt-right has distinguished itself from earlier forms of white nationalism through its largely online presence and its heavy use of irony and humor, particularly through the promotion of [[Internet memes]] like [[Pepe the Frog]]. Membership is overwhelmingly white and male, with academic and anti-fascist observers linking its growth to deteriorating living standards and prospects, anxieties about the place of white masculinity, and anger at increasingly visible [[Leftism|leftist]] movements such as [[Black Lives Matter]]. Groups using the "alt-right" label have been characterised as [[hate group]]s,<ref name="ADL">{{cite web |url=https://www.adl.org/education/resources/backgrounders/alt-right-a-primer-about-the-new-white-supremacy |title=Alt Right: A Primer about the New White Supremacy |website=Anti-Defamation League |access-date=December 27, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/ideology/alt-right |title=Alt-Right |work=Southern Poverty Law Center|access-date=December 27, 2017}}</ref> while alt-right material has contributed to the radicalization of white men responsible for various far-right murders and [[Right-wing terrorism|terrorist attacks]] in the U.S. since 2014.<ref name="SPLC">{{cite news|url=https://www.splcenter.org/20180205/alt-right-killing-people|title=The Alt-Right is Killing People|work=Southern Poverty Law Center|access-date=February 5, 2018}}</ref><ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite news |url=https://www.adl.org/news/press-releases/adl-report-white-supremacist-murders-more-than-doubled-in-2017/ |title=ADL Report: White Supremacist Murders More Than Doubled in 2017 |access-date=January 26, 2018 }}</ref><ref name="DefenseOne">{{cite news|access-date=March 2, 2018|title=White Supremacists Killed More Americans Last Year Than Any Other Domestic-Extremist Group|url=http://www.defenseone.com/threats/2018/01/resurgent-threat-white-supremacist-violence/145243/|newspaper=Defense One}}</ref> Opposition to the alt-right has come from many areas of the political spectrum, including [[Socialism|socialists]], [[Liberalism|liberals]], and [[Conservatism|conservatives]].

== Etymology and scope ==
The term "alt-right" is a [[neologism]] first used in November 2008 by self-described [[Paleoconservatism|paleoconservative]] philosopher [[Paul Gottfried]], addressing the [[H. L.

{{quote box
|quote=The 'alt-right' or 'alternative right' is a name currently embraced by some white supremacists and white nationalists to refer to themselves and their ideology, which emphasizes preserving and protecting the white race in the United States in addition to, or over, other traditional conservative positions such as limited government, low taxes and strict law-and-order. The movement has been described as a mix of racism, white nationalism and populism ... criticizes 'multiculturalism' and more rights for non-whites, women, Jews, Muslims, gays, immigrants and other minorities. Its members reject the American democratic ideal that all should have equality under the law regardless of creed, gender, ethnic origin or race.

The anti-fascist researcher Matthew N. Lyons defined the alt-right as "a loosely organized far-right movement that shares a contempt for both liberal [[multiculturalism]] and [[mainstream]] conservatism; a belief that some people are inherently superior to others; a strong Internet presence and embrace of specific elements of online culture; and a self-presentation as being new, hip, and irreverent."{{sfn|Lyons|2017|p=2}} The academic Tom Pollard referred to the alt-right as a "socio/political movement" comprising "a loose amalgam of rightist groups and causes" who "shun egalitarianism, socialism, feminism, miscegenation, multiculturalism, free trade, globalization, and all forms of gun control".{{sfn|Pollard|2018|p=7}} The journalist Mike Wendling termed it "an incredibly loose set of ideologies held together by what they oppose: feminism, Islam, the Black Lives Matter movement, [[political correctness]], a fuzzy idea they call '[[globalism]],' and establishment politics of both the left and the right."{{sfn|Wendling|2018|p=3}}

The [[Southern Poverty Law Center]] defined the alt-right as "a set of far-right ideologies, groups and individuals whose core belief is that 'white identity' is under attack by multicultural forces using 'political correctness' and 'social justice' to undermine white people and 'their' civilization."<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/ideology/alt-right |title=Alt-Right |website=Southern Poverty Law Center |access-date=April 9, 2019}}</ref> The [[Anti-Defamation League]] states that "alt-right" is a "vague term actually encompass[ing] a range of people on the extreme right who reject mainstream conservatism in favor of forms of conservatism that embrace implicit or explicit racism or white supremacy".<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.adl.org/education/resources/backgrounders/alt-right-a-primer-about-the-new-white-supremacy |title=Alt Right: A Primer about the New White Supremacy |website=Anti-Defamation League |access-date=April 9, 2019}}</ref>

The historian [[Timothy D.

The AP said that it has previously called such beliefs "racist, neo-Nazi or white supremacist".<ref name=ap/> Because the term was coined and used by white nationalists themselves rather than being applied to them by academic observers or by their opponents, the journalist Shaya Tayefe Mohajer urged their colleagues not to use the term "alt-right".<ref>{{cite news |last=Mohajer |first=Shaya Tayefe |date=August 14, 2017 |url=https://www.cjr.org/criticism/alt-right-trump-charlottesville.php |title=It Is Time to Stop Using the Term Alt-Right |website=[[Columbia Journalism Review]] |access-date=April 9, 2019}}</ref> George Hawley, a [[political science|political scientist]] specialising in the [[Radical right (United States)|U.S. far-right]], disagreed with this approach, noting that using terms like "white supremacist" in place of "alt-right" conceals "the ways the Alt-Right differs from other manifestations of the racial right."{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=3}} In 2017, the AP advised journalists to avoid using the term "alt-right", and that any usage should be surrounded with quotations or described as the "so-called alt-right".<ref>{{cite web |last1=Montgomery |first1=Sarah Jasmine |title=Associated Press just laid down the law on why 'alt-right' is a bad term |url=https://www.dailydot.com/debug/associated-press-alt-right-antifa/ |website=The Daily Dot |access-date=7 March 2020 |date=16 August 2017}}</ref>

== History ==
=== Influences ===
The alt-right had various ideological forebears.{{sfnm|1a1=Hawley|1y=2017|1p=21|2a1=Wendling|2y=2018|2p=6}} The idea of [[white supremacy]] had been dominant across U.S. political discourse throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries. After [[World War II]], it was increasingly repudiated and relegated to the [[far-right]] of the country's political spectrum.{{sfn|Niewert|2017|p=220}} Far-right groups retaining such ideas—such as [[George Lincoln Rockwell]]'s [[American Nazi Party]] and [[William Luther Pierce]]'s [[National Alliance (United States)|National Alliance]]—remained marginal.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=25}} By the 1990s, white supremacism was largely confined to neo-Nazi and [[Ku Klux Klan]] (KKK) groups, although its ideologues wanted to return it to the mainstream.{{sfn|Niewert|2017|p=220}} That decade, several white supremacists reformulated their ideas as [[white nationalism]], through which they presented themselves not as seeking to dominate non-white racial groups but rather as lobbying for the interests of [[European Americans]] in a similar way to how civil rights groups lobbied for the rights of [[African Americans]] and [[Hispanic Americans]].{{sfn|Niewert|2017|pp=220–221}} Although white nationalists often officially distanced themselves from white supremacism, white supremacist sentiment remained prevalent in white nationalist writings.{{sfn|Niewert|2017|p=221}}

[[File:2008 Jared Taylor.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The American white nationalist ideologue Jared Taylor became a revered figure among the alt-right, and the events organized by his [[American Renaissance (magazine)|American Renaissance group]] were attended by many alt-right members.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=27}}]]

U.S. white nationalists believed that the United States had been created as a nation explicitly for white people of European descent and that it should remain that way.{{sfn|Niewert|2017|pp=221–222}} Many called for the formation of an explicitly [[White ethnostate|white ethno-state]].{{sfn|Niewert|2017|p=221}} Various neo-Nazi and KKK groups adopted the term "white nationalism" and its associated rhetoric.{{sfn|Niewert|2017|p=225}} Seeking to distance themselves from such groups' violent, [[skinhead]] image, various white nationalist ideologues—namely [[Jared Taylor]], [[Peter Brimelow]], and [[Kevin B. MacDonald]]—sought to cultivate an image of respectability and intellectualism through which to promote their views.{{sfnm|1a1=Hawley|1y=2017|1pp=26–28|2a1=Niewert|2y=2017|2p=221}} Hawley later termed their ideology "highbrow white nationalism", and noted its particular influence on the alt-right.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=26}} Taylor in particular became a revered figure in alt-right circles.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=27}}

Under the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[presidency of George W. Bush]] in the 2000s, the white nationalist movement focused largely on criticising mainstream conservatives rather than [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberals]], accusing them of betraying white Americans.{{sfn|Niewert|2017|p=229}} In that period they drew increasingly on the [[conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]] that had been generated by the [[Patriot movement]] since the 1990s; online, the white nationalist and Patriot movements increasingly conversed and merged.{{sfn|Niewert|2017|p=229}} Following the [[2008 United States presidential election|election]] of [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] candidate [[Barack Obama]] to the [[President of the United States|presidency]] in 2008—making him the first black president of the country—the world-views of a range of right-wing movements, including white supremacists, Patriots, conspiracy theorists, and [[Tea Party movement|Tea Partiers]], increasingly began to coalesce, in part due to a shared racial animus against Obama.{{sfn|Niewert|2017|p=231}}

=== Origins: 2008–13 ===
[[File:Richard B. Spencer in 2016.jpg|thumb|upright|Richard B. Spencer claimed to have coined the term "alternative right" in 2008.]]

According to Hawley, the alt-right began in 2008.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=50}} In November that year, the paleoconservative ideologue and academic [[Paul Gottfried]] gave a talk at his H. L. Mencken Club in [[Baltimore]]. Although the talk was titled "The Decline and Rise of the Alternative Right", it did not contain the phrase "alternative right" itself. Gottfried observed that, as the paleoconservative movement declined, a new cohort of young right-wingers were rising to take its place in challenging the neoconservative ideology then dominant in the Republican Party and broader U.S. conservative movement.{{sfnm|1a1=Hawley|1y=2017|1p=51|2a1=Wendling|2y=2018|2pp=17–20}}<ref name="Gottfried"/><ref name="Nwanevu">{{cite news |title=Is the Term Alt-Right a Euphemism? |first=Osita |last=Nwanevu |website=Slate |date=August 31, 2016 |url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/lexicon_valley/2016/08/31/the_history_of_the_alt_right_label_how_successful_has_it_been_in_shielding.html |access-date=7 September 2018}}</ref> One of those endorsing this idea was Richard B.

After ''The American Conservative'' fired Spencer, in 2008 he became managing director of [[Taki Theodoracopulos]]'s right-wing website ''[[Taki's Magazine]]''.{{sfnm|1a1=Hawley|1y=2017|1p=54|2a1=Lachman|2y=2018|2p=81}}<ref>{{cite news |title=I See a Darkness |last=Alm |first=David |website=The Point |url=https://thepointmag.com/2017/politics/i-see-a-darkness |access-date=7 September 2018}}</ref> The website initially contained contributions largely from paleoconservatives and libertarians, but under Spencer also gave space to white nationalists like Taylor.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=55}} In 2009, Spencer used the term "alternative right" in the title of an article by white nationalist [[Kevin DeAnna]];{{sfn|Niewert|2017|p=236}} by 2010, Spencer had moved fully from paleoconservatism to white nationalism.{{sfn|Niewert|2017|p=237}} Spencer left ''Taki's Magazine'' and in March 2010 launched ''The Alternative Right'' [[webzine]].{{sfnm|1a1=Hawley|1y=2017|1pp=56, 57|2a1=Niewert|2y=2017|2p=236|3a1=Wendling|3y=2018|3p=20|4a1=Lachman|4y=2018|4p=81}}<ref>{{cite web |title=Paleocon Starts New Extreme-Right Magazine |website=Southern Poverty Law Center |date=March 15, 2010 |access-date=September 7, 2018 |url=https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2010/03/15/paleocon-starts-new-extreme-right-magazine}}</ref> Early issues featured articles by white nationalists like Taylor and MacDonald as well as the [[Heathenry (new religious movement)|Heathen]] [[Stephen McNallen]].{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=57}} Spencer noted that "if you look at the initial articles for ''AlternativeRight.com'', that was the first stage of the Alt-Right really coming into its own".{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=57}}

''AlternativeRight.com'' consisted primarily of short essays,{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=19}} covering a range of political and cultural issues.{{sfn|Wendling|2018|p=21}} Many of these reflected the influence of the French Nouvelle Droite, although this declined as the alt-right grew.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|pp=36–37}} Spencer later stated that he wanted to create a movement distinct from the explicit [[white power]] image of neo-Nazi and KKK groups, noting that their approach to white nationalism was "a total nonstarter. No one outside a hardcore coterie would identify with it".{{sfn|Atkinson|2018|p=312}} In 2011 Spencer became the head of the white nationalist [[National Policy Institute]] and launched the ''[[Radix Journal]]'' to promote his views;{{sfnm|1a1=Niewert|1y=2017|1p=238|2a1=Lyons|2y=2017|2p=4}} in 2012, he stepped down from the ''AlternativeRight'' website and took it offline in December 2013.{{sfnm|1a1=Hawley|1y=2017|1pp=63, 64|2a1=Lyons|2y=2017|2p=4}} By that year, Spencer was expressing ambivalence about the "alternative right" label;{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=65}} he preferred to be called an "identitarian".<ref name="auto"/>

=== Emergence: 2014–16 ===

It was on the Internet that Spencer's term "alternative right" was adopted and abbreviated to "alt-right";{{sfn|Niewert|2017|p=236}} according to ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' magazine, the abbreviation "retains the former phrase's associations—the mix of alienation and optimism embedded in the act of proudly affirming an 'alternative' direction—but compacts them into a snappier package."<ref name="Nwanevu"/> The "alt-right" tag was created with public relations in mind, allowing white nationalists to soften their image and helping to draw in recruits from mainstream conservatism.{{sfn|Niewert|2017|p=243}} Many white nationalists gravitated to the term to escape the negative connotations of the term "white nationalism".{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=69}} Spencer thought that by this point, the "Alt-Right" had become "the banner of [[white identity politics]]".{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=68}}

It was on websites like [[4chan]] and [[Reddit]] that the term gained wider usage, and in 2015 began to grow in popularity.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=67}} Although there had previously been a strong [[left-libertarian]] contingent to these online spaces, there was a gradual rightward turn in chan culture centred on 4chan's politics board, [[/pol/]]. This shift took place during the early-mid 2010s.{{sfn|Nagle|2017|p=13}} According to Hawley, the alt-right was "an outgrowth of Internet troll culture",{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=4}} and its emergence was marked by the online [[Gamergate controversy]] of 2014.{{sfnm|1a1=Hawley|1y=2017|1p=47|2a1=Niewert|2y=2017|2pp=215, 233}}<ref>{{cite news |last=Lees |first=Matt |title=What Gamergate should have taught us about the 'alt-right' |website=The Guardian |date=December 1, 2016 |access-date=September 12, 2018 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/dec/01/gamergate-alt-right-hate-trump }}</ref> According to the journalist David Niewert, Gamergate "heralded the rise of the alt-right and provided an early sketch of its primary features: an Internet presence beset by digital trolls, unbridled conspiracism, angry-white-male-identity victimization culture, and, ultimately, open racism, anti-Semitism, ethnic hatred, misogyny, and sexual and gender paranoia."{{sfn|Niewert|2017|p=215}} Gamergate politicized many young people, especially males, in opposition to the perceived [[culture war]] being waged by the cultural left.{{sfn|Nagle|2017|p=24}} Through their shared opposition to political correctness, feminism, and multiculturalism, [[Imageboard|chan]] culture built a link to the alt-right.{{sfn|Nagle|2017|p=16}} By 2015, the alt-right had gained significant momentum as an online movement.{{sfn|Niewert|2017|p=261}}

In March 2016, Breitbart writers Allum Bokhari and [[Milo Yiannopoulos]] published "An Establishment Conservative's Guide to the Alt-Right".{{sfnm|1a1=Niewert|1y=2017|1p=247|2a1=Lyons|2y=2017|2p=16|3a1=Wendling|3y=2018|3p=118}} In that article, they described the alt-right as being derived from the U.S. [[Old Right (United States)|Old Right]] and paleoconservatism, as well as the Nouvelle Droite and older right-wingers like [[Oswald Spengler]], [[Henry Louis Mencken]], and [[Julius Evola]]. Bokhari and Yiannopoulos' piece became "perhaps the most widely cited article about the movement" in the mainstream press;{{sfn|Wendling|2018|p=118}} [[CNN]] described it as being similar to a [[manifesto]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/08/25/politics/alt-right-explained-hillary-clinton-donald-trump/ |title=Clinton is attacking the 'Alt-Right'—What is it? |last=Krieg |first=Gregory |website=CNN |date=August 25, 2016 |access-date=September 3, 2018}}</ref> Wendling characterized the article as a work of [[apologetics]] for the alt-right, noting that it downplayed the movement's more extreme elements and championed its counter-cultural value.{{sfn|Wendling|2018|p=119}} Hawley described the article as "the most sympathetic portrayal of the movement to appear in a major media venue to date".{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=145}} The commentator [[Angela Nagle]] suggested that Yiannopoulos did "more than anyone else to give the alt-right a presentable face".{{sfn|Nagle|2017|p=49}}

Many alt-rightists responded negatively to Bokhari and Yiannopoulos' article. ''The Daily Stormer'' referred to it as "the Product of a Degenerate Homosexual and an Ethnic Mongrel", with Anglin producing a response article titled "A Normie's Guide to the Alt-Right" in which he placed the 1488 scene at the centre of the movement.{{sfn|Wendling|2018|p=129}} On ''Occidental Dissent'', Griffin asked: "What the hell does Milo Yiannopoulos—a Jewish homosexual who boasts about carrying on interracial relationships with black men—have to do with us?"{{sfn|Lyons|2017|p=16}} Various press sources termed Yiannopoulos "alt-right";<ref>{{cite web |title=Milo Yiannopoulos: Who is the alt-right writer and provocateur? |website=BBC News |date=February 21, 2017 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-39026870 |access-date=September 7, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.standard.co.uk/lifestyle/london-life/who-is-milo-yiannopoulos-everything-you-need-to-know-about-donald-trumps-altright-poster-boy-a3404921.html |first=Phoebe |last=Luckhurst |date=November 25, 2016 |website=The Evening Standard |title=Who is Milo Yiannopoulos?

Alt-rightists who attended the rally often found themselves facing personal and legal repercussions for their involvement, while Internet service providers and mainstream social media websites subsequently terminated many alt-right accounts and sites.{{sfnm|1a1=Atkinson|1y=2018|1p=310|2a1=Phillips|2a2=Yi|2y=2018|2p=227}} Prominent figures like Spencer became reticent about organizing public protests of this kind in future.{{sfn|Atkinson|2018|p=310}} He experimented with the use of flash demonstrations, returning to Charlottesville with a much smaller group for an unannounced protest in October.{{sfn|Atkinson|2018|p=312}} Unite the Right exacerbated tensions between the alt-lite and more extreme elements of the movement.{{sfnm|1a1=Hawley|1y=2017|1p=152|2a1=Atkinson|2y=2018|2p=310}} Breitbart distanced itself from the alt-right and criticized other media outlets that described them in such a manner,{{sfn|Wendling|2018|p=215}} as did Yiannopoulos, who insisted he had "nothing in common" with Spencer.{{sfn|Wendling|2018|p=214}}

==== Influence and decline ====
Although the movement saw significant gains in 2015 and 2016, it began significantly declining in power and membership in 2017 and 2018. This has happened for multiple reasons, including the backlash of the Unite the Right rally, the fracturing of the movement, more effective banishment of hate speech and harassment from major social media websites and widespread opposition by the American population.<ref name=":9">{{Cite news |last=Hayden |first=Michael Edison |url=http://www.newsweek.com/alt-right-fractured-violent-headed-trump-second-year-785552 |title=The alt-right is fractured, more violent headed into Trump's second year |date=January 21, 2018 |work=Newsweek |access-date=January 21, 2018 }}</ref> In 2018, Heidi Beirich of the Southern Poverty Law Center described it as "imploding", while Marilyn Mayo of the Anti-Defamation League stated that the alt-right was in "a downward spiral, but it doesn't mean they're going to disappear".<ref name="imploding">{{cite news |last=McCoy |first=Terrence |title='Imploding': Financial troubles.

When Spencer canceled the remaining dates of his college tour, releasing a video in which he declared that "antifa is winning", Zack Beauchamp of ''[[Vox (website)|Vox]]'' summarised that "[s]ome saw this as evidence that violence worked to suppress the alt-right; others wondered if the movement's less violent activities, like publicly identifying white nationalist activists, may have played a bigger role. Regardless, the alt-right has undeniably declined in influence since then — though other, more nakedly violent far-right movements have risen in its wake."<ref>{{cite news|last=Beauchamp|first=Zack|date=June 8, 2020|url=https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2020/6/8/21277320/antifa-anti-fascist-explained|title=Antifa, explained|website=Vox|access-date=June 12, 2020}}</ref> Writing for ''[[The Guardian]]'', Jason Wilson credited [[Antifa (United States)|antifa]]'s tactics for having "led not only to failed events and dwindling cadres but to infighting and blame games in an increasingly fractious far-right movement" and that "the alt-right looks like it is crumbling." Nonetheless, Wilson argues that the broader far-right is still active and energized, citing the example of the [[Proud Boys]] and [[Turning Point USA]] that "you don't need to tote swastikas to engage in political violence" and "how attacking the left can be given a veneer of respectability." Wilson also highlights that a lot of far-right political beliefs partially entered mainstream during the Trump era, citing the resurgence of [[antisemitism in the United States]] as an example. However, Wilson concludes "it seems that the white supremacist alt-right will not survive the Trump era as a coherent movement. If so, antifascist activists can take a large measure of credit."<ref>{{cite news|last=Wilson|first=Jacon|date=March 19, 2018|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/19/the-alt-right-is-in-decline-has-antifa-activism-worked|title=The alt-right is in decline.

== Beliefs ==
The alt-right has been characterized as belonging on the [[far-right]] of the political spectrum.{{sfnm|1a1=Lyons|1y=2017|1p=2|2a1=Mudde|2y=2019|2pp=60–61|3a1=Nagle|3y=2017|3p=9}}<ref name="FarRight"/> There is no unifying manifesto behind the alt-right and different people who describe themselves as "alt-rightists" express different beliefs about what it wants to achieve.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=11}} There are nevertheless recurring attitudes that exist within the movement.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=11}} The alt-right's views are profoundly [[anti-egalitarian]],{{sfn|Wendling|2018|p=4}} and it rejects many of the basic premises of the [[Age of Enlightenment]] and [[classical liberalism]].{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=92}} For this reason, Hawley thought that "the Alt-Right seems like a poor fit for the United States, where both the left and right have roots in classical liberalism and the Enlightenment."{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=36}}

The key division within the alt-right is between those who embrace explicitly neo-Nazi and white supremacist stances, and those white nationalists who present a more moderate image.{{sfn|Wendling|2018|p=135}} Wendling suggested that this was "a distinction lacking a hugely significant difference".{{sfn|Wendling|2018|p=124}} The white supremacist and neo-Nazi alt-rightists are sometimes termed "1488s", a combination of the white supremacist [[fourteen words]] slogan with 88, a coded reference to "HH", or "[[Heil Hitler]]".{{sfnm|1a1=Hawley|1y=2017|1p=68|2a1=Atkinson|2y=2018|2p=312|3a1=Phillips|3a2=Yi|3y=2018|3p=222}} These neo-Nazi elements represent a minority within the alt-right.{{sfnm|1a1=Hawley|1y=2017|1p=14|2a1=Wendling|2y=2018|2p=124|3a1=Phillips|3a2=Yi|3y=2018|3p=222}} Many on the less extreme end of the movement are critical of them, believing that they "go too far" or generate bad publicity for it.{{sfnm|1a1=Hawley|1y=2017|1p=14|2a1=Wendling|2y=2018|2p=136|3a1=Phillips|3a2=Yi|3y=2018|3p=222}} Some of the latter mock the neo-Nazi and explicitly white supremacist elements as "Stormfags", a reference to the white supremacist website [[Stormfront (website)|Stormfront]].{{sfn|Phillips|Yi|2018|p=222}}

The concept has further been associated with several groups such as [[American nationalism|American nationalists]], [[National-anarchism|national-anarchists]],<ref>{{cite news|url=https://psmag.com/news/the-principles-of-the-alt-right-have-been-around-for-nearly-a-century|title=Welcome to the New Age of Anarcho-Fascism|work=Pacific Standard|access-date=June 14, 2018}}</ref> and neo-[[monarchists]].<ref name="reuters"/><ref name="WilsonGuardian"/><ref name="bostonglobe"/><ref name="MensRights">{{cite web|url=http://nymag.com/thecut/2016/12/mens-rights-activists-are-flocking-to-the-alt-right.html|title=Men's-Rights Activists Are Finding a New Home With the Alt-Right|date=December 14, 2016|work=New York Magazine|access-date=April 28, 2017}}</ref><ref name="NYer-Marantz"/>

=== White nationalism ===
The alt-right is a white nationalist movement and is fundamentally concerned with white identity.{{sfnm|1a1=Hawley|1y=2017|1p=11|2a1=Lyons|2y=2017|2p=2|3a1=Nagle|3y=2017|3p=8}}<ref name="DobratzWaldner2019"/> Spencer described the alt-right as "identity politics for white Americans and for Europeans around the world";<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/alt-right-richard-spencer-punched-anti-donald-trump-protest-meme-pepe-the-frog-inauguration-day-a7541461.html |title=Alt-right leader Richard Spencer worries getting punched will become 'meme to end all memes' |date=January 23, 2017 |work=[[The Independent]] |access-date=February 25, 2017 |author=Maya Oppenheim}}</ref> he and some other alt-rightists identify as "identitarians".{{sfn|Phillips|Yi|2018|p=223}} Not all members of the alt-right actively embrace the term "white nationalist" in reference to themselves.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=11}} Hawley commented that the alt-right is, "at its core, a racist movement";{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=3}} similarly, the historian David Atkinson stated that the alt-right was "a racist movement steeped in white supremacist ideas".{{sfn|Atkinson|2018|p=312}} Attitudes to non-white people vary within the alt-right, from those who desire tighter restrictions on non-white [[Immigration to the United States|immigration into the U.S.]] to those who call for a violent [[ethnic cleansing]] of the country.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=16}}

[[File:Charlottesville "Unite the Right" Rally (35780262984).jpg|thumb|left|Protestors at the 2017 Unite the Right rally, which was promoted by the alt-right. One man carries the logo of [[Vanguard America]], and another has a [[t-shirt]] depicting German Nazi leader [[Adolf Hitler]].]]

In contrast to the majority of scholars, who regard race as a socio-cultural construct, the alt-right promotes [[scientific racism]], making the claim that racial differences represent distinct biological differences. For the alt-right, this view is referred to as "race realism".{{sfn|Atkinson|2018|p=311}} There is a recurring tendency among alt-rightists to rank these racial groups on a hierarchy according to perceived [[IQ]] levels: this hierarchy has [[Asian people|Asians]] and [[Ashkenazi]] Jews at the top, followed by non-Jewish whites, then Arabs, and finally black Africans.{{sfn|Wendling|2018|p=85}} Unlike earlier forms of racist thought, such as those of the [[Interwar period|interwar]] [[Fascism|fascists]], the alt-right emphasizes the idea of racial difference above that of racial superiority, leaving the latter either implicit or secondary in its discourse.{{sfn|Gray|2018|p=148}} Most alt-rightists reject the label of "white supremacist".{{sfn|Phillips|Yi|2018|p=222}}

Having analysed alt-right posts online, the political scientists Joe Phillips and Joseph Yi noted that a pervasive underlying theme was the belief that white people were victims and that white Americans had been disadvantaged by government policies such as [[affirmative action]] for non-white groups, assistance to [[illegal immigration|illegal immigrants]], and the perceived denigration of "white history" like [[Christopher Columbus]] and the [[Confederate States of America]].{{sfn|Phillips|Yi|2018|p=222}} Alt-right online discourse also expressed much anger at the idea of [[white privilege]], often promoted by the American Left, with members citing job insecurity, under employment or unemployment, and growing mortality rates among whites as evidence that they do not lead privileged lives.{{sfn|Phillips|Yi|2018|p=222}} Alt-rightists wish to see an end to measures they believe disadvantage white Americans, including affirmative action, toleration of illegal immigration, and the public removal of symbols of "white history", such as statues of Columbus.{{sfn|Phillips|Yi|2018|pp=224–225}} Spencer stated that "anti-white animus in society at large is palpable."<ref>{{cite web |first=Thomas J. |last=Main |title=What's the Alt-Right? |url=http://touch.latimes.com/#section/-1/article/p2p-88717755/ |website=Los Angeles Times |date=August 25, 2016 |access-date=October 30, 2016}}</ref>

Many alt-right figures have expressed the desire to push white nationalist ideas into the [[Overton window]]—the range of ideas tolerated in public discourse.{{sfn|Atkinson|2018|p=313}} The alt-right has served as a bridge between white nationalism and traditional conservatism and as a tool used by white nationalists to push their rhetoric into the mainstream.<ref name="Hartzell">{{cite journal|first1=Stephanie L.|last1=Hartzell|title=Alt-White: Conceptualizing the "Alt-Right" as a Rhetorical Bridge between White Nationalism and Mainstream Public Discourse.|url=http://derby.openrepository.com/derby/handle/10545/622321|journal=Journal of Contemporary Rhetoric |volume=8 |issue=1/2|date=2018|pages=6–25}}</ref> For instance, prominent alt-right figures on Twitter have used hashtag activism focused on the [[white genocide conspiracy theory]], combined with more mainstream-oriented alt-right hashtags, to bring more radical white nationalist beliefs into the mainstream.<ref name=WhiteGenocide>{{cite journal|first1=Wilson, Andrew|last1=Fergus|title=#whitegenocide, the alt-right and conspiracy theory: How secrecy and suspicion contributed to the mainstreaming of hate.|url=http://derby.openrepository.com/derby/handle/10545/622321|journal=Secrecy & Society|date=February 16, 2018}}</ref>

Many leaders of the alt-right movement, including include Spencer, Anglin, [[Mike Cernovich]], [[John Derbyshire]] and [[Kyle Chapman (New Zealand activist)|Kyle Chapman]] are married to, or have been romantically involved with, women of Asian descent. Writing in ''The New York Times'', the journalist Audrea Lim quoted an alt-right commenter who stated that "exclusively" dating Asian women was akin to a "white-nationalist rite of passage". Lim speculated that the trend may arise from "the intersection of two popular racial myths", that Asian-Americans are a hard-working, high-achieving, and well-behaved "model minority", and that Asian women are subservient and hypersexualized.<ref>{{cite website |last=Lim |first=Audrea |date=January 6, 2018 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/06/opinion/sunday/alt-right-asian-fetish.html |title=The Alt-Right's Asian Fetish |website=The New York Times |access-date=March 11, 2019 }}</ref>

====White separatism and ethno-states====
The alt-right is typically [[white separatism|white separatist]], with its members desiring autonomy and self-determination in their own white communities.{{sfn|Phillips|Yi|2018|p=224}} Some envision breaking up the United States into multiple states, each inhabited by a different ethnic or racial group.{{sfn|Phillips|Yi|2018|p=224}} Spencer has stated that he is not clear how the white ethno-state in North America would be formed.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=15}} He stated that "I don't know how we're going to get there, because the thing is, history will decide that for us... You have to wait for a revolutionary opportunity to present itself, and history will present that opportunity."{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=15}} He suggested that it could be achieved through "peaceful ethnic cleansing", with non-whites given financial incentives to leave.{{sfn|Wendling|2018|p=22}} He compared his white nationalist movement for an ethno-state with the early days of [[Zionism]], which began in the 19th century with calls for the formation of a Jewish ethno-state and resulted in the formation of Israel in the mid-20th century.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=15}}

Many alt-rightists are similarly unclear as to how a white ethno-state would actually be formed, but are content instead to promote the idea, particularly to people who had not previously considered it.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|pp=15–16}} The prominent alt-rightist Greg Johnson suggested that it would come about after white nationalists became the dominant force in U.S. politics. At that point, he argued, the government would deport all undocumented migrants from the country and then introduce measures to encourage all other non-whites to emigrate from the country.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=16}} Other alt-rightists are critical of the idea of breaking up the United States into ethno-states, arguing that this would mean breaking up the country that their Euro-American ancestors fought to build.{{sfn|Phillips|Yi|2018|p=224}} They instead argue for restrictive immigration policies to ensure that the U.S. continues to be a white-majority state.{{sfn|Phillips|Yi|2018|p=226}}

Rather than seeking independent white ethno-states, some alt-rightists promote a pan-white empire spanning Europe and North America.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=172}} Spencer noted that he did not want his proposed white ethno-state to be small, and that he wanted it to eventually form part of "a global empire... something on a very large scale. And that is a homeland for all white people, whether you're German or Celtic or Slavic or English."{{sfn|Wendling|2018|pp=24–25}} He described this as "one big [[Roman Empire]]" and suggested that it should engage in imperial expansion into the [[Near East]], focusing on conquering [[Istanbul]]; in Spencer's words, Istanbul was "such a profoundly symbolic city. Retaking it, that would be a statement to the world."{{sfn|Wendling|2018|p=25}} He added that its present [[Turkish people|Turkish]] inhabitants would be made to leave, for they could go to "the Middle East or something. Who cares?"{{sfn|Wendling|2018|p=25}}

====Antisemitism====
[[File:YOU WILL NOT REPLACE US (-Charlottesville -UniteTheRight).webm|thumb|right|upright=1.6|Footage of right-wing protesters at the Unite the Right rally chanting "you will not replace us".]]

Some elements of the alt-right are [[antisemitic]] but others are tolerant of Jews.{{sfnm|1a1=Barkun|1y=2017|1p=439|2a1=Wendling|2y=2018|2p=10}}<ref name="Gray">{{cite news |last=Gray |first=Phillip W. |title=The Alt-Right: An Introduction (Part I) |website=Oxford Research Group |url=https://www.oxfordresearchgroup.org.uk/blog/the-alt-right-an-introduction-part-i |date=19 December 2018 |access-date=19 March 2019 }}</ref> Many in the alt-right believe that there is a Jewish conspiracy within the United States to achieve "[[white genocide conspiracy theory|white genocide]]", the elimination of white people as a racial group and their replacement with non-whites.{{sfnm|1a1=Atkinson|1y=2018|1pp=310–311|2a1=Wendling|2y=2018|2p=44}} They believe that [[Zionist Occupation Government conspiracy theory|a Jewish cabal controls the U.S. government, media, and universities]], and is pursuing its aim of white genocide by spreading anti-white tropes and encouraging African-American civil rights groups.{{sfn|Atkinson|2018|p=310}} As evidence for this supposed white genocide, these far-right figures point to the depiction of inter-racial couples or mixed-race children on television and the publication of articles discouraging women from having children early in life.{{sfn|Kelly|2017|p=73}} They also cite apparent instances of white self-hatred, including [[Rachel Dolezal]], an American woman of European descent who identifies as black.{{sfn|Wendling|2018|p=42}}

This antisemitic conspiracy theory is not new to the alt-right, but has recurred among far-right groups in [[Western world|Western]] countries since the 19th century; it was the reason for the Holocaust and various anti-Semitic pogroms in European history.{{sfn|Atkinson|2018|p=310}} Andrew Anglin, one of the most prominent alt-right ideologues and a member of its neo-Nazi wing, stated "the core concept of the movement, upon which all else is based, is that Whites are undergoing an extermination, via mass immigration into White countries which was enabled by a corrosive liberal ideology of White self-hatred, and that the Jews are at the center of this agenda."{{sfn|Niewert|2017|p=250}} In response to a ''[[Washington Post]]'' article portraying the movement as "offensiveness for the sake of offensiveness", Anglin said: "No it isn't. The goal is to ethnically cleanse White nations of non-Whites and establish an authoritarian government. Many people also believe that the Jews should be exterminated."{{sfn|Niewert|2017|p=254}}<ref name=NesbitHankes>{{cite web |url=https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2016-09-12/what-is-the-alt-right |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161121112806/http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2016-09-12/what-is-the-alt-right |title=What Is the Alt-Right? |last=Nesbit |first=Jeff |date=September 12, 2016 |publisher=[[U.S. News and World Report]] |url-status=dead |archive-date=November 21, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2016/08/25/whose-alt-right-it-anyway |title=Whose Alt-Right Is It Anyway? |last=Hankes |first=Keegan |date=August 25, 2016 |publisher=Southern Poverty Law Center |access-date=April 8, 2019}}</ref> Other alt-rightists, like Spencer, welcome the involvement of Jews within their movement.{{sfn|Lyons|2017|p=7}}

=== Opposition to neoconservatism and political correctness ===
The alt-right sought to hasten the downfall of U.S. conservatism,{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=7}} and conservatives were often the main target of alt-right wrath.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=91}}
The prominent alt-right ideologue Brad Griffin stated "Alt Right is presenting itself as a sleek new challenger to mainstream conservatism and libertarianism... Alt Right was designed to appeal to a younger audience who reject the Left, but who don't fit in on the stuffy or banal Right either."{{sfn|Niewert|2017|p=239}} The American [[anarcho-capitalist]] advocate [[Jeffrey Tucker]] has said that the alt-right is opposed to [[Libertarianism in the United States|libertarianism]] because the alt-right focuses on group identity and tribalism instead of individual liberty.<ref name=fee>{{cite web |last1=Tucker |first1=Jeffrey |title=Five Differences Between the Alt-Right and Libertarianism |url=https://fee.org/articles/five-differences-between-the-alt-right-and-libertarians/ |publisher=[[Foundation for Economic Education]]|access-date=September 7, 2016 |date=August 26, 2016}}</ref> The alt-right places little emphasis on economic issues.{{sfnm|1a1=Hawley|1y=2017|1p=17|2a1=Wendling|2y=2018|2p=10}} Unlike mainstream U.S. conservatives, alt-rightists do not tend to favour [[laissez-faire]] economics, and most appear to support President Trump's [[protectionist]] economic measures.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=17}}

Phillips and Yi noted that alongside "[[white identity politics]]", the alt-right promotes "a message of expressive transgression against left-wing orthodoxy ('political correctness')".{{sfn|Phillips|Yi|2018|p=225}} [[Nicole Hemmer]] stated on [[NPR]] that [[political correctness]] is seen by the alt-right as "the greatest threat to their liberty".<ref name="NPR"/> Alt-rightists often employ the term "[[Cultural Marxism]]"—originally coined in reference to a specific form of [[Marxism|Marxist]] thought but popularised among the U.S. right-wing in the 1990s—in reference to a perceived leftist conspiracy to alter society. They apply the term "Cultural Marxism" to a broad range of left movements.{{sfn|Wendling|2018|pp=81–82}}

===Isolationism and anti-interventionism===

The alt-right has no specific platform on U.S. foreign policy,{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=17}} although it has been characterised as being non-interventionist,<ref name="Hemmer"/> as well as isolationist.<ref name="Nwavenu"/> Generally, it opposes established Republican Party views on foreign policy issues.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=17}} Alt-rightists typically opposed President Bush's [[War on Terror]] policies,{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=17}} and spoke against the [[2017 Shayrat missile strike]].<ref name="Hemmer">{{cite web |last=Hemmer|first=Nicole|author-link=Nicole Hemmer |date=April 15, 2017 |url=https://www.vox.com/the-big-idea/2017/4/14/15290394/intervention-isolation-trump-america-first-syria |title=After the Syria strikes, right-wing non-interventionists are back in the wilderness |website=Vox |access-date=September 4, 2018}}</ref><ref name="Nwavenu">{{cite web |last=Nwanevu |first=Osita |date=April 7, 2017 |url=https://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2017/04/07/why_the_alt_right_hates_trump_s_syria_strike.html |title=Why the Alt-Right Hates Trump's Syria Strike |website=Slate |access-date=September 4, 2018}}</ref> The alt-right has no interest in spreading democracy abroad and opposes America's close relationship with Israel.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=17}}

The alt-right often looks favorably on Russian president [[Vladimir Putin]], viewing him as a strong, nationalistic white leader who defends his country from both radical Islam and Western liberalism.{{sfnm|1a1=Hawley|1y=2017|1p=17|2a1=Wendling|2y=2018|2p=202|3a1=Pollard|3y=2018|3p=83}} Spencer praised Putin's Russia as the "most powerful white power in the world",{{sfn|Lachman|2018|p=80}} while prominent alt-rightist Matthew Heimbach called Putin "the leader of the free world."{{sfn|Michael|2019|p=74}} Although during the [[Cold War]] the U.S. right-wing often presented the [[Soviet Union]] as the main threat to the U.S., links between the U.S. far-right and Russia grew during the 2000s, when prominent far-right activists like [[David Duke]] visited the country; the latter described Russia as being "key to White survival".{{sfn|Michael|2019|pp=65, 72–73}} The far-right Russian political theorist [[Aleksandr Dugin]] is also viewed positively by the alt-right.{{sfnm|1a1=Gray|1y=2018|1p=143|2a1=Wendling|2y=2018|2p=202}} Dugin has written for Spencer's websites,{{sfn|Michael|2019|p=73}} and Spencer's estranged wife, the ethnically [[Georgians|Georgian]] Nina Kouprianova, has translated some of Dugin's work into English.{{sfnm|1a1=Wendling|1y=2018|1p=202|2a1=Lachman|2y=2018|2p=80|3a1=Michael|3y=2019|3p=73}} Many alt-rightists also regard Syrian president [[Bashar al-Assad]] as a heroic figure for standing up to rebel groups in the [[Syrian Civil War]].{{sfnm|1a1=Hawley|1y=2017|1p=17|2a1=Wendling|2y=2018|2p=213}} Heimbach has endorsed a Shi'ite axis between al-Assad's Syria, Iran, and [[Hezbollah]] in Lebanon, seeing them as allies in the global struggle against Zionism.{{sfn|Michael|2019|p=74}}

=== Anti-feminism and sex-related issues===
The alt-right is [[anti-feminist]] and favors a more patriarchal society.{{sfnm|1a1=Hawley|1y=2017|1p=17|2a1=Wendling|2y=2018|2p=7|3a1=Pollard|3y=2018|3p=79}} This is a stance shared by its female supporters, who represent a minority within the movement.<ref name="AtlanticWomen">{{cite news |first=Caroline |last=Kitchener |access-date=August 29, 2018 |title=The Women Behind the 'Alt-Right' |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/08/the-women-behind-the-alt-right/537168/ |website=The Atlantic |date=18 August 2017}}</ref><ref name="HarpersWomen">{{cite news |url=https://harpers.org/archive/2017/09/the-rise-of-the-valkyries/ |title=The Rise of the Valkyries |work=Harper's Magazine |access-date=July 11, 2018 |date=September 2017 |first=Seyward |last=Darby}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/women-joining-alt-right |title=Why are women joining the 'alt-right' |website=PBS |date=August 19, 2017 |access-date=July 11, 2018 }}</ref> Unlike many U.S. conservatives, the alt-right does not argue its anti-feminist position from traditional Christian perspectives, but claims that it is rooted in what it calls "sex realism", arguing that as a result of their biological differences, men and women are suited to different tasks in society.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=17}} Lyons commented that the alt-right was [[misogyny|misogynistic]] and presented women as irrational and vindictive.{{sfn|Lyons|2017|p=8}} Prominent female alt-rightists have experienced harassment and abuse from within the movement.<ref name="HarpersWomen" /><ref name="AtlanticWomen" /> ''The Daily Stormer'', for instance, banned female contributors and called for reduced female involvement in the white nationalist movement, producing an angry response from various white nationalist women.{{sfn|Lyons|2017|p=8}}

[[File:Trump-WomensMarch 2017-1060165 (32298826522).jpg|thumb|left|A placard criticising the alt-right displayed at the [[2017 Women's March]].]]

The alt-right intersects with the [[manosphere]], an online anti-feminist subculture.{{sfnm|1a1=Lyons|1y=2017|1p=8|2a1=Wendling|2y=2018|2pp=59, 63}} There is overlap between the alt-right and the [[men's rights movement]], a part of the manosphere which believes that men, rather than women, face more oppression in Western society.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=17}} It also adopts the movement's view that [[feminism]] has undermined and emasculated men, and believes that men should aggressively reassert their masculinity so as not to become "beta males" or "cucks".{{sfn|Atkinson|2018|p=311}} There has been some clear influence between the two movements; prominent manosphere ideologue [[RooshV]], for instance, attended an NPI conference and quoted anti-Semitic material from white nationalist sources in his articles.{{sfnm|1a1=Lyons|1y=2017|1p=9|2a1=Nagle|2y=2017|2p=89}} Some alt-right figures have distanced themselves from the manosphere and its proponents; Greg Johnson of ''Counter-Currents Publishing'' was of the view that "the manosphere morally corrupts men" because it does not promote "the resurgence of traditional and biologically based sexual norms", but rather encourages [[rape culture]].{{sfn|Lyons|2017|p=9}}

On social issues like attitudes to [[homosexuality]] and [[abortion]], the alt-right is divided; in contrast to the great attention U.S. conservatives have given these issues, they have been of little interest to the alt-right.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|pp=17–18}} Hawley suggested that the alt-right was more broadly pro-choice than the conservative movement.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=103}} Many on the alt-right favored legal abortion for its eugenic purposes, highlighting that it was disproportionately used by African-American and Hispanic-American women.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=103}} Some on the alt-right consider homosexuality to be immoral and a threat to the survival of the white race,{{sfn|Lyons|2017|p=10}} with alt-right trolls having employed [[homophobia|homophobic]] terminology like "[[faggot (slang)|faggot]]".<ref>{{cite web |first=Michelangelo |last=Signorile |title=Donald Trump's Hate-Fueled, Alt-Right Army Hates 'Faggots' Too |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trumps-hate-fueled-alt-right-army-hates-faggots-too_us_57e11904e4b04a1497b67558 |website=The Huffington Post |date=September 21, 2016 |access-date=October 30, 2016}}</ref> Others adopt a more tolerant stance, and have praised gay white nationalists.{{sfn|Lyons|2017|pp=9–10}} This reflects a broader trend among white nationalists to denigrate gay culture while being more tolerant of gay writers and musicians like James O'Meara and [[Douglas P.|Douglas Pearce]], whose views they sympathize with.{{sfn|Lyons|2017|p=10}}

===Religion===
The alt-right is broadly [[Secularity|secular]].{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=100}} Many of its members are [[atheism|atheists]],{{sfn|Wendling|2018|p=7}} or highly skeptical of [[organized religion]].{{sfn|Wendling|2018|p=44}} Some alt-rightists identify as Christians;{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=102}} ''The Right Stuff'', for instance, hosted an alt-right Christian podcast called "The Godcast".{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=104}} There are also individuals in the movement who do not believe in Christian teachings but identify as [[cultural Christian]]s, admiring the Christian heritage of Western society.{{sfn|Wendling|2018|p=7}} Others on the alt-right [[Opposition to Christianity|oppose Christianity entirely]], criticizing it for its Jewish roots, for being a universal religion that seeks to cross racial boundaries, and for encouraging what they see as a "slave morality" that they contrast with perceived ancient aristocratic values.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|pp=100, 101}} Some elements pursue [[modern Paganism]].{{sfn|Wendling|2018|p=7}}<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/amp/article/517785/ |title=Breaking Faith |website=The Atlantic |date=April 2017 |last=Beinart |first=Peter |access-date=February 8, 2018}}</ref> Although it agrees with the Christian Right's conservative stance on issues like abortion and same-sex marriage, white evangelical leaders of the [[Southern Baptist Church]] have angered the alt-right by expressing support for refugees entering the U.S., calling for measures to help undocumented migrants gain legal status, and urging members not to display the Confederate Battle Flag.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|pp=101–102}} Despite this, alt-right hostility to Christianity has waned over time, with many alt-right commentators identifying as Christian while rejecting mainstream Christian politics and most mainstream Christian religious leaders, especially [[Pope Francis]].{{sfn|Hawley|2017|pp=103–104}}

Several press sources have linked the alt-right to [[Islamophobia]],<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.thenation.com/article/islamophobes-white-supremacists-and-gays-for-trump-the-alt-right-arrives-at-the-rnc/ |title=Islamophobes, White Supremacists, and Gays for Trump–the Alt-Right Arrives at the RNC |work=The Nation |date=July 20, 2016 |access-date=October 1, 2016 |first=Joan |last=Walsh}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Lynch |first1=Conor |title=With their Orlando response, Trump and the alt-right are playing directly into the hands of ISIS |url=http://www.salon.com/2016/06/14/with_their_orlando_response_trump_and_the_alt_right_are_playing_directly_into_the_hands_of_isis/ |work=Salon |date=June 14, 2016}}</ref> and Wendling stated that alt-rightists view Islam as a fundamental threat to Western society.{{sfn|Wendling|2018|p=7}} Hawley expressed the view that "ironically, people on the Alt-Right are less Islamophobic than many mainstream conservatives".{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=42}} He observed that many U.S. conservatives criticized Muslim migration to the United States because they regarded Islam as a threat to liberty; the alt-right has made little use of this argument. For alt-rightists, migration from Islamic-majority countries is undesirable not because the migrants are Muslims, but because most of them are non-white; it is equally opposed to non-white migrants who are Christian or non-religious.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|pp=40–42}}

According to Hawley, the alt-right was "a disorganized mob that broadly shares a number of goals and beliefs".{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=70}}
The alt-right is not an organized movement, and has no formal institutions or leading elite.{{sfnm|1a1=Hawley|1y=2017|1p=11|2a1=Lyons|2y=2017|2p=2|3a1=Wendling|3y=2018|3p=5}} It is a predominantly online phenomenon,{{sfnm|1a1=Hawley|1y=2017|1p=18|2a1=Wendling|2y=2018|2p=3}} lacking print newspapers and little radio or television presence.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=18}} It had no think tanks that influenced government policy and could not command the open allegiance of any major politicians or mainstream pundits.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=18}} Unlike many counter-cultural movements, it lacked [[soft power]] in the form of original bands, songs, films, and other cultural artifacts, of which it produced very few.{{sfn|Wendling|2018|p=9}} According to Hawley, it was the movement's success in using the Internet that allowed it "to punch above its weight in the political arena".{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=19}}

The alt-right made use of a large number of blogs, podcasts, forums, and webzines in which it discussed far-right political and cultural ideas.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=19}} The use of the Internet by the far-right was not pioneered by the alt-right; the white supremacist web forum [[Stormfront (website)|Stormfront]] had for instance been active since 1996.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=20}} Where the alt-right differed was in its members willingness to leave far-right websites and engage in [[trolling]] on other parts of the Internet, such as the comments sections of major news websites, [[YouTube]], and Twitter.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=20}} According to Hawley, it was the alt-right's use of trolling which put it "into the national conversation".{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=19}}

The movement's online structure had strengths in that it allowed members to say things anonymously online that they would not be willing to say on the street or in another public place.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=26}} The lack of any formal organisation also meant that nobody could be kicked out of the alt-right.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=26}}

As the alt-right developed, a number of formal, real world events were held, particularly through the National Policy Institute.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=20}} Members of the alt-right have also attended events organised by an older far-right white nationalist group, [[American Renaissance (magazine)|American Renaissance]].{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=20}} These events have gained a more limited audience than the alt-right's online activities.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=20}} This may be because operating online allows members of the alt-right to operate anonymously, while to attend events they must often expose themselves to journalists and protesters, thus making it more likely that their views will become publicly known.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=20}} U.S. alt-rightists have also sought to build links with other far-right and white nationalist groups elsewhere in the world. Heimbach, for instance, addressed meetings of the [[Golden Dawn (political party)|Golden Dawn]] in Greece and the [[National Democratic Party of Germany]].{{sfn|Michael|2019|p=74}} Various U.S.-based alt-rightists used social media to encourage support for the [[Alternative for Germany]] party in that country's [[2017 German federal election|2017 federal election]].{{sfn|Morstatter|Galstyan|Shao|Karunasekera|2018|p=621}}

"Dissident right" is a term used by some groups within the alt-right to make white nationalism appear more mainstream or fun.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Southern Poverty Law Center reports uptick in white nationalist groups, warns of violence|url=https://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/488266-southern-poverty-law-center-reports-uptick-in-white-nationalist|last=Coleman|first=Justine|date=2020-03-18|website=TheHill|language=en|access-date=2020-05-14}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Before Charlottesville, a young man walked away.

During October and November 2019, [[Turning Point USA]]'s "Culture War" college tour was frequently targeted by the dissident right, led by [[Nick Fuentes]], who consider some groups to be not sufficiently conservative on issues of race and ethnicity, immigration, and LGBTQ rights.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Why alt-right trolls shouted down Donald Trump Jr.|url=https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/11/11/20948317/alt-right-donald-trump-jr-conservative-tpusa-yaf-racism-antisemitism|last=Coaston|first=Jane|date=2019-11-11|website=Vox|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191112152101/https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/11/11/20948317/alt-right-donald-trump-jr-conservative-tpusa-yaf-racism-antisemitism|archive-date=November 12, 2019|access-date=2019-11-13}}</ref>

== Tactics ==
Alt-rightists often make reference to [[freedom of speech]] when calling for their views to be heard in public discourse.{{sfn|Hofmann-Kuroda|2017|p=369}} A recurrent tactic of alt-rightists is to present themselves—as white men—as victims of oppression and prejudice; this subverts many leftist arguments about other social groupings being victims and is designed to infuriate leftist opponents.{{sfn|Wendling|2018|p=73}}

The alt-right also make heavy use of imagery drawn from popular culture for its own purposes.{{sfn|Niewert|2017|pp=256–257}} For instance, the American singer [[Taylor Swift]] is often held up as an idealised example of "Aryan" beauty.{{sfn|Niewert|2017|p=257}} When describing their own conversion to the movement, alt-rightists refer to themselves as having been "getting red pilled", a reference to a scene in the 1999 film ''[[The Matrix]]'' in which Neo, the protagonist, chooses to discover the truth behind reality by consuming a red pill.{{sfnm|1a1=Hawley|1y=2017|1p=83|2a1=Kelly|2y=2017|2p=74|3a1=Niewert|3y=2017|3p=257}} On alt-right blogs and message boards, members often discuss how they were "red-pilled" originally.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|pp=83–84}} Alt-rightists have also adopted [[milk]] as a symbol of their views; various members have used the words "Heil Milk" in their online posts while Spencer included an [[emoji]] of a glass of milk on his Twitter profile along with the statement that he was "very tolerant... lactose tolerant!"{{sfn|Stănescu|2018|p=104}} The [[animal studies]] scholar Vasile Stănescu suggested that this notion drew upon the 19th-century pseudoscientific idea that Northern Europeans had become biologically superior to many other human populations because they consumed high quantities of milk and meat products.{{sfn|Stănescu|2018|pp=104–105}}

=== Use of humor and irony ===

The alt-right makes strong use of humor and irony in its rhetoric.{{sfnm|1a1=Hawley|1y=2017|1p=20|2a1=Niewert|2y=2017|2p=256}} As noted by Nagle, the alt-right's use of humor renders it difficult to tell "what political views were genuinely held and what were merely, as they used to say, for the lulz."{{sfn|Nagle|2017|p=2}} The alt-right presented an image which was much less threatening than that of earlier white nationalist groups, and thus was able to attract people who would be willing to visit alt-right websites who would not have considered attending neo-Nazi or KKK events.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=25}} As noted by Hawley, "whereas older white nationalists came across as bitter, reactionary, and antisocial, much of the Alt-Right comes across as youthful, light-hearted, and jovial—even as it says the most abhorrent things about racial and religious minorities."{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=20}} Members of the alt-right sometimes made fun of the earnestness and seriousness of earlier white nationalists such as William Pierce.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=76}}

Another of the tactics employed online by alt-rightists is to parody their leftist opponents. One teenaged American alt-rightist for instance created a Twitter account for a fictional individual whom they described as an "LGBTQ+ pansexual nonbinary POC transwoman" who was a "Journalist for BLM. Always stayin [[woke]]".{{sfn|Wendling|2018|pp=49–50}} Alt-rightists also orchestrated pranks, again to cause alarm among opponents. For instance, during the 2016 presidential campaign alt-rightists presented claims that they were plotting to send representatives posing as officials to voting booths where they would suppress ethnic minority turnout. There was no such plot, but press sources like ''[[Politico]]'' picked up on the claims and presented them as fact.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|pp=75–76}} Such incidents reflected the alt-right's willingness to lie to advance their interests.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=75}} This tendency toward trolling renders it difficult for journalists to learn more about the alt-right because those members they talked to were willing to deceive them for their amusement.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=74}}

Nagle suggested that the alt-right's use of such tactics made it strongly transgressive and thus part of a tradition that she traced back to the work of the [[Marquis de Sade]] in the 18th century.{{sfn|Nagle|2017|pp=28–29}} She argued that it was with the alt-right that "the transgressive anti-moral style" reached "its final detachment from any egalitarian philosophy of the left or Christian morality of the right".{{sfn|Nagle|2017|p=39}}

===Use of memes===

When referring to African-Americans, alt-rightists regularly employed the meme "dindu nuffin"—a [[Corruption (linguistic)|bastardization]] of "didn't do nothing"—in reference to claims of innocence by arrested African-Americans.

=== Harassment ===
Wendling noted that campaigns of abuse for political ends were "a classic alt-right tactic",{{sfn|Wendling|2018|p=131}} while Hawley called the alt-right "a subset of the larger Internet troll culture".{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=73}} Those most regularly targeted were Jewish journalists, mainstream conservative journalists, and celebrities who publicly criticized Trump.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=88}} Such harassment was usually spontaneous rather than pre-planned, but in various cases many alt-right piled on once the harassment had begun.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=87}} The conservative journalist [[David A. French]]—who is white—received much abuse referencing [[Nancy French|his white wife]] and adopted black daughter after criticizing Trump and the alt-right. Alt-right trolls sent him images of his daughter in a gas chamber, "with a smiling Trump in a Nazi uniform preparing to press a button and kill her", and repeatedly claimed that he liked to watch his wife have sex with "black bucks".{{sfn|Lyons|2017|p=15}}

''The Daily Stormer'' for instance targeted the British Member of Parliament (MP) [[Luciana Berger]], who is Jewish, by encouraging its followers to send her photoshopped images in which [[Yellow badge#Nazi Germany and Axis Powers|a yellow star]] appeared on her head; the hashtag "Hitlerwasright" also featured on the images.{{sfn|Wendling|2018|p=131}} Anglin termed this program of harassment "Operation: Filthy Jew Bitch".{{sfn|Wendling|2018|p=132}} One UK-based alt-rightist was arrested and convicted for his involvement in the campaign.<ref>{{cite web |title=Racist troll guilty of harassing Labour MP with antisemitic posts |date=December 7, 2016 |website=The Guardian |access-date=September 20, 2018 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/dec/07/racist-troll-guilty-harassing-labour-mp-luciana-berger-joshua-bonehill-paine }}</ref> In another instance, Anglin commented on [[Murder of Jo Cox|the June 2016 murder]] of the British MP [[Jo Cox]] by a far-right activist by saying that "Jo Cox was evil and she deserved to die. Her death was not a tragedy, it was justice."{{sfn|Wendling|2018|p=138}} While celebrating violence, ''The Daily Stormer'' is cautious to remain on the legal side of U.S. incitement laws.{{sfn|Wendling|2018|p=138}}

In December 2016, the artist [[Arrington de Dionyso]], whose murals are frequently displayed at the [[Comet Ping Pong]] pizzeria, described the alt-right's on-line campaign of harassment against him. He averred of the attacks in general: "I think it's a very deliberate assault, which will eventually be a coordinated assault on all forms of free expression".<ref name="Arrington de Dionyso essay.">{{cite web |url=https://medium.com/@arringtond/how-i-became-a-target-of-the-alt-right-66f14eceaffe |title=How I became a target of the alt-right: What it's like to be targeted by Neo-Nazis and supporters of Donald Trump online—and what I learned from it |last=de Dionyso |first=Arrington |date=December 13, 2016 |website=Medium |access-date=March 20, 2019}}</ref> The [[Pizzagate conspiracy theory]] which inspired said harassment has drawn comparisons with the [[Gamergate controversy]].<ref name="Arrington de Dionyso interview">{{cite web |url=http://hyperallergic.com/347458/artist-targeted-by-pizzagate-conspiracy-theory-speaks/ |title=Artist Targeted by #Pizzagate Conspiracy Theory Speaks: &nbsp;After being dragged into one of 2016's strangest news stories over a mural he made six years ago, Arrington de Dionyso took a public stand against far-right extremists' mob censorship |last=Murphy |first=Blair |date=December 22, 2016 |website=Hyperallergic |access-date=March 20, 2019}}</ref> [[2017 Jewish Community Center bomb threats|A wave of threats]] against [[Jewish Community Center]]s starting in 2017 were blamed on the alt-right in a January 2017 article by ''[[Slate (website)|Slate]]''{{'}}s Elissa Strauss, who said members of the alt-right viewed them as "a practical joke".<ref>{{cite news |last1=Strauss |first1=Elissa |title=The JCC Bomb Threats Confirm That Jewish Parents Are Right to Be Afraid |url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/xx_factor/2017/01/19/the_jcc_bomb_threats_confirm_that_jewish_parents_are_right_to_be_afraid.html |access-date=March 23, 2017 |work=Slate |date=January 19, 2017}}</ref>

== Demographics ==
The anonymized and decentralized nature of the alt-right makes it difficult to determine how many individuals are involved in it or the demographic attributes of this membership.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=77}} The movement's members are concentrated in the United States, but with participants present in other Anglophone countries like Canada, Britain, and Australia, as well as in parts of continental Europe.{{sfn|Wendling|2018|p=8}} The movement is majority male,{{sfn|Wendling|2018|p=149}}<ref name="AtlanticWomen"/> although Hawley suggested that about 20% of its support might be female.<ref name="AtlanticWomen"/>

From the nature of the online discourse as well as the attendees of events organized by NPI and American Renaissance, Hawley believed that the majority of alt-right participants are younger on average than the participants of most previous American far-right groups.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=77}} Spencer suggested that "if we were to make a composite image of the Alt-Right, I would probably say someone who is thirty years old, who is a tech professional, who is an atheist, and who lives on one of the coasts."{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=78}} Wendling, however, suggested that "the alt-right's self-image of themselves as a force made up of ranks of hipsterish, erudite well-educated men is misleading".{{sfn|Wendling|2018|p=131}} In contrast to the movement's self-presentation as "a cool posse of young intelligent kids", through his research he found that many of those active on alt-right forums were middle-aged men from working-class backgrounds.{{sfn|Wendling|2018|p=146}}

[[File:White supremacist (35782612633).jpg|thumb|right|An attendee at the Unite the Right rally carrying a firearm and wearing a Confederate Battle Flag T-shirt.]]

On interviewing young members of the alt-right, Hawley noted that many articulated the common theme, stating that they embraced far-right politics in response to the growing racial polarisation of the Obama era, in particular the public debates around the shootings of [[Trayvon Martin]] and [[Shooting of Michael Brown|Michael Brown]] and the rise of the [[Black Lives Matter]] movement.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=78}} Hawley suggested that many of these young people were willing to embrace the idea of dismantling the United States in favour of a new, [[white ethno-state]] because they had grown up in the U.S. during the post-civil rights era. In contrast, he thought, older white nationalists were keener to retain links to patriotic American imagery because they nostalgically recalled a period of U.S. history when segregation and overt white dominance were a part of life and believed that this system could be reinstated.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|pp=80–81}}

Wendling believed that a large portion of the alt-right were university students or recent graduates, many bearing a particular grudge against political correctness.{{sfn|Wendling|2018|p=8}} The alt-right ideologue Greg Johnson suggested that the alt-right was drawing in better educated people than previous white nationalist movements because the career prospects for college-educated European Americans had declined by the late 2000s. Whereas a college degree was previously perceived as a guaranteed ticket to a middle-class lifestyle, he noted that this was no longer the case and that many college and university educated people felt resentful and, due to unemployment or underemployment, had growing amounts of time on their hands which they could spend on the Internet.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|pp=78–79}}

Yiannopoulos claimed that some "young rebels" are drawn to the alt-right not for deeply political reasons, but "because it promises fun, transgression, and a challenge to social norms". According to ''The New Yorker'', "testing the strength of the speech taboos that revolve around conventional politics-of what can be said, and how directly" is a major component of alt-right identity. The beliefs that make the alt-right perceptible as a movement "are in their essence not matters of substance but of style" and the alt-right's tone may just be concealing "a more familiar politics".<ref>{{cite news |last=Wallace-Wells |first=Benjamin |date=May 5, 2016 |url=http://www.newyorker.com/news/benjamin-wallace-wells/is-the-alt-right-for-real |title=Is the Alt-Right for Real? |website=The New Yorker |access-date=April 2, 2019}}</ref>

A research study of 447 self-identified alt-right members found higher levels of [[dark triad]] traits compared to the general population, and that members of the alt-right were more likely to express prejudice against black people and admit to engaging in aggressive behavior. Alt-right members also had significantly high levels of dehumanization, with the mean alt-right scores comparable to how the general public views the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]]. Alt-right members viewed Hillary Clinton, Muslims, feminists, Nigerians and journalists as the least well rated groups on the dehumanization scale while white people, men and Americans were rated the best.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vox.com/platform/amp/science-and-health/2017/8/15/16144070/psychology-alt-right |title=Psychologists surveyed hundreds of alt-right supporters. The results are unsettling. |website=Vox |access-date=January 15, 2018}}</ref>

===Causal factors===
The scholar of [[American studies]] Annie Kelly argued that the alt-right was "both inspired and defined by a discourse of anxiety about traditional white masculinity", a discourse which was "dominant in much of the political and cultural mainstream". In her view, much of the "groundwork" for this discourse was set forth by the conservative movement in the years following the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001.{{sfn|Kelly|2017|p=69}} Hawley concurred that American conservatism was "at least somewhat responsible for the rise of the Alt-Right", because some individuals within the conservative movement, such as [[Ann Coulter]], had "effectively delegitimized complaints about hate speech and racism" as part of their attacks on political correctness in the years before the alt-right's appearance.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=44}} This is something acknowledged by some conservatives, like columnist [[Matt K.

Commentator [[Angela Nagle]] said that a mainstream "alt-light" more interested in performance than political goals helped the alt-right in its rise, saying that should the alt-right grow to generate great violence, those on the right who helped to make the alt-right look attractive, such as Yiannopoulos, "will have to take responsibility for having played their role" in enabling its growth.{{sfn|Nagle|2017|p=9}} She also suggested that "the hysterical liberal call-out" culture of the 2010s, in which "everyone from saccharine pop stars to [[Justin Trudeau]] [was called] a 'white supremacist' and everyone who wasn't [[2016 United States presidential election#Notable expressions, phrases, and statements|With Her]] a sexist" made it more difficult for people to recognize when a far-right movement really emerged online; she compared the situation with the tale of [[The Boy Who Cried Wolf]].{{sfn|Nagle|2017|pp=8–9}} Disagreeing with Nagle's view that the alt-right was primarily a "response to the stupidity of marginal Internet liberalism", the anti-fascist reporter Jay Firestone—who had spent three months undercover in New York's alt-right community—instead argued that it was a "response to decades of decline in standards of living for working people, amid the proliferation of unemployment and meaningless, dead-end jobs."<ref>{{cite news |last=Firestone |first=Jay |title=Three Months Inside Alt-Right New York |website=Commune |date=Spring 2019 |url=https://communemag.com/alt-right-new-york/ |access-date=March 24, 2019}}</ref>

Political scientist Philip W. Gray cited several reasons for the emergence of the alt-right. In his analysis, new online media had reduced the conservative movement's ability to enforce its boundaries against the far-right, while the growing distance of the [[World War II|Second World War]] meant that pride in the U.S. victory over [[Nazi Germany]] and [[Fascist Italy (1922–1943)|Fascist Italy]] provided less of a barrier to the American far-right than it had when there were still large numbers of people who remembered the conflict.{{sfn|Gray|2018|pp=151–152}} Gray also argued that the alt-right was a reaction against the left-wing racial and social agitation of the 2010s, in particular the Black Lives Matter movement and the popularisation of concepts like [[white privilege]] and [[male privilege]], as well as events like the racial unrest in [[2015 Baltimore protests|Baltimore]] and [[Ferguson unrest|Ferguson]], and the shooting of police officers in [[2016 shooting of Dallas police officers|Dallas]] and [[2016 shooting of Baton Rouge police officers|Baton Rouge]].{{sfn|Gray|2018|pp=152–153}}

|quote=The sprawling networks the alt-right has built around its poisonous, racist ideology have violence at its core in its pursuit of a white ethnostate. The white, male grievance culture that the leaders of the alt-right are incubating has already inspired more than 40 deaths and left more than 60 people injured.

And unfortunately, the alt-right seems likely to inspire more, as it moves further into the real world. Its leaders continue to abdicate all responsibility for the violence their ideology inspires and are becoming increasingly recalcitrant in the face of widespread condemnation.

... After a year [2017] of escalating alt-right violence, we are probably in for more.

In 2017, Hawley noted that the alt-right was not a violent movement, but that this could potentially change.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=170}} From their analysis of online discourse, Phillips and Yi concluded that "rather than violence, most Alt-Right members focus on discussing and peacefully advocating their values".{{sfn|Phillips|Yi|2018|p=224}} They added that presenting the alt-right as a violent, revolutionary movement, or equating all alt-rightists with the 1488 scene, was "an intellectual failure akin to treating all Muslims or black nationalists as radicals and terrorists", also noting that it served as a "rhetorical tactic" for progressives.{{sfn|Phillips|Yi|2018|p=224}}

Conversely, Wending noted that there were individuals on the extreme end of the alt-right willing to use violence.{{sfn|Wendling|2018|p=12}} He stated that "the culture of the alt-right is breeding its own brand of terrorists: socially isolated young men who are willing to kill."{{sfn|Wendling|2018|p=173}} The alt-right movement has been considered by some political researchers a terrorist movement and the process of alt-right radicalization has been compared to Islamic terrorism by [[political scientists]] and leaders.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/13/opinion/university-virginia-uva-protests-charlottesville.html |title=What U.Va.

The [[Rise Above Movement]] (RAM), based in Southern California, has been linked to various violent acts, including participation in the Unite the Right rally.

===Incidents averted===
In August 2019, James Patrick Reardon of [[New Middleton, Ohio]] was arrested by local police on charges of telecommunications harassment and aggravated menacing after an [[Instagram]] posting appeared to threaten violent action against the Jewish Community Center synagogue of [[Youngstown, Ohio]]. Reardon had appeared in a 2017 [[National Geographic]] documentary about the [[Unite the Right rally]] in [[Charlottesville, Virginia]], in which he identified himself as a [[white nationalist]] and a member of the alt-right. Other posts on Reardon's Instagram account featured images of Reardon shooting weapons, anti-semitic comments and white nationalist material. A search of Reardon's home found an arsenal of weapons and ammunition, including knives and two assault rifles, along with bulletproof armor and a gas mask. Reardon's bail was set for $200,000, and the judge ruled that if he made bail, he would be subject to house arrest with no work privileges, and random home and computer searches and drug testing. He would also be ordered to avoid social media and stay 500 feet away from any Jewish places of worship or community centers.<ref>Andone, Dakin; Vera, Amir; and McLaughlin, Eliott C.

== Reactions ==
The alt-right presented "a unique set of challenges" to journalists, progressives, and conservatives.{{sfn|Wendling|2018|p=3}} The political scientist [[George Haley|George Hawley]] suggested that the alt-right may pose a greater threat to [[Progressivism in the United States|progressivism]] than the mainstream conservative movement.{{sfn|Hawley|2016|p=69}} Hawley was of the view that, because of its use of novel tactics not previously used by the far-right, "the Alt-Right represents something genuinely new on the American political scene".{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=11}} Lyons stated that the alt-right "helped revitalize White nationalist and male supremacist politics in the United States",{{sfn|Lyons|2017|p=17}} while according to Niewert, the alt-right gave white nationalism "a fresh new life, rewired for the twenty-first century".{{sfn|Niewert|2017|p=220}} Kelly noted that it was "important not to overstate the numbers of the alt-right, nor their power as a voting bloc", but that their success could be measured "in terms of their ever-increasing dissemination of extreme right-wing ideals and their ability to project an updated rhetoric of anti-left antagonism into the Overton window of acceptable political discourse."{{sfn|Kelly|2017|p=76}}

A poll by [[ABC News]] and ''[[The Washington Post]]'' found that 10% of respondents supported the alt-right, to 50% who opposed it.{{sfn|Atkinson|2018|p=313}} An [[Ipsos]] and [[Reuters]] poll found 6% of respondents supported the movement.{{sfn|Atkinson|2018|p=313}} Such polls indicate that while millions of Americans are supportive of the alt-right's message, they remain a clear minority.{{sfn|Atkinson|2018|p=313}} Gray suggested that the alt-right may have benefited from the manner in which—in the years building up to its appearance—progressives often attacked the Tea Party movement and other right-wingers by accusing them of racism. He suggested that this left many right-wingers with the impression that they would be accused of racism "regardless of how near or far they are from the centre" and that this made them more willing to listen to the alt-right's message.{{sfn|Gray|2018|p=146}}

In 2018, the documentary film ''Alt-Right: Age of Rage'' was released. Directed by [[Adam Bhala Lough]], it included interviews with Spencer and Taylor as well as with anti-fascist activists devoted to combatting the alt-right.<ref>{{cite news |last=DeFore |first=John |title='Alt-Right: Age of Rage': Film Review |website=The Hollywood Reporter |date=March 9, 2018 |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/alt-right-age-rage-1093400 |access-date=March 24, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Robertson |first=Adi |title=Alt-Right: Age of Rage is a snapshot of one of 2017's darkest moments |date=March 14, 2018 |website=The Verge |url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/14/17113514/alt-right-age-of-rage-antifa-film-review-sxsw-2018 |access-date=March 24, 2019 }}</ref>

Opponents of the alt-right have not reached a consensus on how to deal with it.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=160}} Some opponents emphasized "calling out" tactics, labelling the alt-right with terms like "racist", "sexist", "homophobic", and "white supremacist" in the belief that doing so would scare people away from it.{{sfn|Wendling|2018|pp=3–4}} Many commentators urged journalists not to refer to the alt-right by its chosen name, but rather with terms like "neo-Nazi".{{sfn|Kelly|2017|p=68}} There was much discussion within U.S. public discourse as to how to avoid the "normalization" of the alt-right.{{sfn|Kelly|2017|p=69}} The activist group Stop Normalizing, which opposes the [[normalization (sociology)|normalization]] of terms like alt-right, developed the "Stop Normalizing Alt Right" [[Google Chrome extension|Chrome extension]].

Some on the political right, including Yiannopoulos, suggest that the alt-right's appeal would be diffused if society accepted many of its less extreme demands, including curbing political correctness and ending mass immigration.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=160}} Yiannopoulos added that, as part of such an approach, the left should cease holding different social groups to different standards of behavior. He noted that if the left wanted to continue using identity politics as the basis of much of its mobilization, it would have to accept [[white identity politics]] as a permanent fixture of the political landscape.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=160}} Similarly, in highlighting the commonalities between alt-right and "left-identitarian" forms of identity politics, Gray suggested the alt-right's presence might encourage "the intersectional Left and its allies" to increasingly critique the theoretical basis on which their own identity politics is built.{{sfn|Gray|2018|p=153}} Other commentators, like the conservative [[David Frum]], have suggested that if issues like immigration policy were discussed more openly in public discourse, then the alt-right would no longer be able to monopolize them.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=164}}

Some opponents sought to undermine the alt-right's stereotype of leftists as being devoid of humor and joy by using its own tactics of humor and irony against it. For instance, when alt-rightists became angry or upset, some of their opponents described them as "snowflakes" who were being "triggered".{{sfn|Wendling|2018|pp=221–222}} Anti-fascist activists also adopted the alt-right's use of pranks; on several occasions they publicized events in which they were purportedly meeting to destroy Confederate monuments or gravestones. Alt-rightists mobilized to publicly defend these sites, only to find that no such anti-fascist event was happening at all.{{sfn|Wendling|2018|p=221}} Within feminist circles, the alt-right's desired future was repeatedly compared to the [[The Handmaid's Tale#Setting|Republic of Gilead]], the fictional dystopia in [[Margaret Atwood]]'s ''[[The Handmaid's Tale]]'' (1985) and its [[The Handmaid's Tale (TV series)|2017 television adaptation]].{{sfn|Marghitu|Johnson|2018|p=184}}

[[File:Charlottesville "Unite the Right" Rally (35780272084).jpg|thumb|left|Counter-protesters at the 2017 Unite the Right rally.]]

Various opponents have also employed doxing, publicly revealing the identities and addresses of alt-rightists, many of whom had previously acted anonymously.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=166}} This tactic discourages individuals from involving themselves in alt-right activities to begin with, as they fear that should they be outed as alt-rightists they might face repercussions such as job loss, social ostracization, or violence.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=168}} From 2016 onward, some anti-fascist opponents of the alt-right also resorted to physical confrontation and violence against the movement.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=169}} On Trump's inauguration day, for example, a masked anti-fascist punched Spencer in the face when he was talking to reporters; the footage was widely shared online.{{sfnm|1a1=Hawley|1y=2017|1p=169|2a1=Wendling|2y=2018|2pp=2–3}} Hawley noted that this tactic could be counter-productive to the anti-alt-right case, as it reinforces the narrative that alt-rightists peacefully engaging in their constitutionally-protected right to free speech were being victimized.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|pp=169–170}}

Other commentators have called for more vigorous policing of the web by governments and companies to deal with the alt-right.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=161}} If denied access to mainstream social media outlets, the alt-right would be restricted to far-right online venues like Stormfront, where it would be isolated and ignored from those not already committed to its cause.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=163}} Many in the alt-right concur that denying it access to social media would have a devastating effect on its ability to proselytize.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=161}} However, it has also been suggested that such censorship could backfire, as it would play into the alt-right narrative that those campaigning for white interests were being marginalized by the establishment, thus aiding the movement's recruitment.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=164}} Suppressing the alt-right in this manner would also set a precedent which could be repeated for other groups in future, including leftist ones.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=165}} Phillips and Yi argued that such leftist attempts to prevent alt-right speech reflected an "authoritarian shift" which was becoming "increasingly hegemonic" within the American Left and that endorsed the view that "limiting or preventing the public speech of historically privileged groups (typically whites, males) is acceptable until power relations are equalized."{{sfn|Phillips|Yi|2018|p=226}}
