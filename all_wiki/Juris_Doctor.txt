The degree was first awarded in the United States in the early 20th century and was created as a modern version of the old European doctor of law degree (such as the ''Dottore in Giurisprudenza'' in Italy and the ''[[Doctor of both laws|Juris Utriusque Doctor]]'' in Germany and central Europe).<ref name="auto">Stevens, R.

To be fully authorized to practice law in the courts of a given state in the United States, the majority of individuals holding a J.D. degree must pass a [[Multistate Performance Test|bar examination]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ncble.org/ |title=North Carolina Board of Law Examiners &#124;NCBLE 919-848-4229 |website=Ncble.org |date=20 March 2017 |accessdate=17 April 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=itembridge.com |url=http://barexam.virginia.gov/ |title=VBBE - Welcome |website=Barexam.virginia.gov |date= |accessdate=17 April 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://admissions.calbar.ca.gov/Requirements.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=24 September 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100914204116/http://admissions.calbar.ca.gov/Requirements.aspx |archivedate=14 September 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nybarexam.org/ |title=Bole- Official Page New York State Bar Examination |website=Nybarexam.org |date= |accessdate=17 April 2017}}</ref> The state of Wisconsin, however, permits the graduates of its two law schools to practice law in that state, and in its state courts, without having to take its bar exam—a practice called "diploma privilege"—provided they complete the courses needed to satisfy the diploma privilege requirements. In the United States, passing an additional bar exam is not required of lawyers authorized to practice in at least one state to practice in some but not all of the national courts of the United States, courts commonly known as "federal courts". Lawyers must, however, be admitted to the bar of the federal court before they are authorized to practice in that court. Admission to the bar of a federal district court includes admission to the bar of the related bankruptcy court.

==Etymology and abbreviations==
In the [[United States]], the professional doctorate in law may be conferred in Latin or in English as ''Juris Doctor'' (sometimes shown on [[Latin]] diplomas in the [[accusative]] form ''Juris Doctorem'') and at some law schools Doctor of Law (J.D. or JD),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/us/jd|title=JD|work= Oxford Living Dictionaries|accessdate=15 April 2017|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]}}</ref> or Doctor of Jurisprudence (also abbreviated JD or J.D.).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://catalog.utexas.edu/law/degrees/doctor-jurisprudence/|publisher=University of Texas|title=Doctor of Jurisprudence|accessdate=13 February 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.stanford.edu/dept/registrar/bulletin0910/4928.htm|publisher=[[Stanford University]]|title=Doctor of Jurisprudence|accessdate=13 February 2017}}</ref> "''Juris Doctor''" literally means "teacher of law", while the Latin for "Doctor of Jurisprudence"—''Jurisprudentiae Doctor''—literally means "teacher of legal knowledge".

The J.D. is not to be confused with Doctor of Laws or ''[[Legum Doctor]]'' (LLD or LL.D.). In institutions where the latter can be earned, e.g. [[Cambridge University]] (where it is titled "Doctor of Law", though still retaining the abbreviation LLD) and many other British institutions, it is a higher research doctorate representing a substantial contribution to the field over many years, a standard of professional experience beyond that required for a [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] and academic accomplishment well beyond a professional degree such as the J.D.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cambridgestudents.cam.ac.uk/your-course/examinations/graduate-exam-information/higher-degrees/higher-doctorates|title=Higher doctorates|publisher=University of Cambridge|accessdate=14 February 2017}}</ref>  In the United States, the LL.D. is invariably an honorary degree.

==Historical context==

===Origins of the law degree===

The first university in Europe, the [[University of Bologna]], was founded as a school of law by four famous legal scholars in the 11th century who were students of the [[glossator]] school in that city. This served as the model for other law schools of the [[Middle Ages]], and other early universities such as the [[University of Padua]].<ref>García y García, A. (1992).

===The history of legal training in England===
[[File:London-Inns-of-Court.JPG|right|thumb|The [[Inns of Court]] of London served as a professional school for lawyers in England]]

The nature of the J.D. can be better understood by a review of the context of the history of legal education in England. The teaching of law at Cambridge and Oxford Universities was mainly for philosophical or scholarly purposes and not meant to prepare one to practice law.<ref>Stein (1981), 434, 435.</ref>  The universities only taught civil and canon law (used in a very few jurisdictions such as the courts of admiralty and church courts) but not the common law that applied in most jurisdictions. Professional training for practicing common law in England was undertaken at the [[Inns of Court]], but over time the training functions of the Inns lessened considerably and apprenticeships with individual practitioners arose as the prominent medium of preparation.<ref>Stein (1981), 434, 436.</ref> However, because of the lack of standardisation of study and of objective standards for appraisal of these apprenticeships, the role of universities became subsequently of importance for the education of lawyers in the English speaking world.<ref name="stein19811981"/>

In England in 1292 when [[Edward I]] first requested that lawyers be trained, students merely sat in the courts and observed, but over time the students would hire professionals to lecture them in their residences, which led to the institution of the Inns of Court system.<ref>Stein, R. (1981). [http://digitalcommons.pace.edu/lawfaculty/228/ The Path of Legal Education from Edward to Langdell: A History of Insular Reaction], Pace University School of Law Faculty Publications, 1981, 57 Chi.-Kent L. Rev. 429, p. 430.</ref> The original method of education at the Inns of Court was a mix of [[moot court]]-like practice and lecture, as well as court proceedings observation.<ref>Stein (1981), 431.</ref> By the fifteenth century, the Inns functioned like a university akin to the [[University of Oxford]] and the [[University of Cambridge]], though very specialized in purpose.<ref>Stein (1981), 432.</ref> With the frequent absence of parties to suits during the [[Crusades]], the importance of the lawyer role grew tremendously, and the demand for lawyers grew.<ref>Stein (1981), 433.</ref>

Traditionally Oxford and Cambridge did not see common law as worthy of study, and included coursework in law only in the context of canon and civil law (the two "laws" in the original Bachelor of Laws, which thus became the Bachelor of Civil Law when the study of canon law was barred after the Reformation) and for the purpose of the study of philosophy or history only. The apprenticeship program for [[solicitor]]s thus emerged, structured and governed by the same rules as the apprenticeship programs for the trades.<ref>Stein (1981), 434.</ref> The training of  solicitors by a five-year apprenticeship was formally established by the Attorneys and Solicitors Act 1728.<ref name="stein1981">Stein (1981), 435.</ref> [[William Blackstone]] became the first lecturer in English common law at the University of Oxford in 1753, but the university did not establish the program for the purpose of professional study, and the lectures were very philosophical and theoretical in nature.<ref name="stein1981"/> Blackstone insisted that the study of law should be university based, where concentration on foundational principles can be had, instead of concentration on detail and procedure had through apprenticeship and the Inns of Court.<ref>Moline, Brian J., [http://www.washburnlaw.edu/wlj/42-4/articles/moline-brian.pdf Early American Legal Education], 42 Washburn Law Journal 775, 793 (2003).</ref>

The 1728 act was amended in 1821 to reduce the period of the required apprenticeship  to three years for graduates in either law or arts from Oxford, Cambridge and Dublin, as "the admission of such graduates should be facilitated, in consideration of the learning and abilities requisite for taking such degree".<ref>{{cite  book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=avNMAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA74#v=onepage&q&f=false|title= 1 & 2 George IV. c. 48 |date=8 June 1821}}</ref> This was extended in 1837 to cover the newly established universities of Durham and London,<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FfVQAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA1153|title=1 Vict. c. 56|date=15 July 1837|last1=Chitty|first1=Joseph}}</ref> and again in 1851 to include the new Queen's University of Ireland.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i6RKAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA640|title=14 & 15 Vict. c. LXXXVIII.| date= 7 August 1851|last1=Britain|first1=Great}}</ref>

The Inns of Court continued but became less effective, and admission to the bar still did not require any significant educational activity or examination. In 1846, Parliament examined the education and training of prospective [[barristers]] and found the system to be inferior to that of Europe and the United States, as Britain did not regulate the admission of barristers.<ref name="stein19811981">Stein (1981), 436.</ref> Therefore, formal schools of law were called for but were not finally established until later in the century, and even then the bar did not consider a university degree in admission decisions.<ref name="stein19811981"/>

Until the mid nineteenth century, most law degrees in England (the BCL at Oxford and Durham, and the LLB at London)<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l8UUAAAAQAAJ|title=Oxford University Calendar|date=1833|last1=Baxter|first1=W.}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kt8NAAAAQAAJ|title=Durham University Calendar|date=1844}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3uENAAAAQAAJ|title=London University Calendar|date=1845|last1=Univ|first1=London}}</ref> were postgraduate degrees, taken after an initial degree in Arts. The Cambridge degree, variously referred to as a BCL, BL or LLB, was an exception: it took six years from matriculation to complete, but only three of these had to be in residence, and the BA was not required (although those not holding a BA had to produce a certificate to prove they had not only been in residence but had actually attended lectures for at least three terms).<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ad4NAAAAQAAJ|title=Cambridge University Calendar|date=1833}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VoMPRz8nYQEC&pg=187|title=A History of the University of Cambridge:, Volume 3; Volumes 1750-1870|pages=187–190|author=Peter Searby|year=1988|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521350600}}</ref> These degrees specialised in Roman civil law rather than in English common law, the latter being the domain of the Inns of Court, and thus they were more theoretical than practically useful.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Ol0qAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA533|title=The Solicitors' Journal|date=29 April 1865}}</ref> Cambridge reestablished its LLB degree in 1858 as an undergraduate course alongside the BA,<ref name="LL Cantab">{{cite web|url=http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0001669/18581020/082/0003|title=Cambridge|date=20 October 1858|via=[[British Newspaper Archive]]|work=Norwich Mercury|url-access=subscription}}</ref> and the London LLB, which had previously required a minimum of one year after the BA, become an undergraduate degree in 1866.<ref name="LLB Lond">{{cite book|title=University of London Calendar|date=1866|page=95|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IeQNAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA95|last1=Univ|first1=London}}</ref> The older nomenclature continues to be used for the BCL at Oxford today, which is a master's level program, while Cambridge moved its LLB back to being a postgraduate degree in 1922 but only renamed it as the LLM in 1982.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.law.cam.ac.uk/courses/llm/the_history_of_the_llm.php|title=LLM|publisher=Cambridge University Faculty of Law|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071102202003/http://www.law.cam.ac.uk/courses/llm/the_history_of_the_llm.php|archive-date=2 November 2007}}</ref>

Between the 1960s and the 1990s, law schools in England took on a more central role in the preparation of lawyers and consequently improved their coverage of advanced legal topics to become more professionally relevant. Over the same period, American law schools became more scholarly and less professionally oriented, so that in 1996 Langbein could write: "That contrast between English law schools as temples of scholarship and American law schools as training centers for the profession no longer bears the remotest relation to reality".<ref name="Langbein1996"/>

===Legal training in colonial North America and 19th-century United States===

Initially there was much resistance to lawyers in colonial North America because of the role they had played in hierarchical England, but slowly the colonial governments started using the services of professionals trained in the Inns of Court in London, and by the end of the [[American Revolution]] there was a functional bar in each state.<ref>Moline (2003), 775.</ref> Due to an initial distrust of a profession open only to the elite in England, as institutions for training developed in what would become the United States they emerged as quite different from those in England.<ref>Stein (1981), 429.</ref>

Initially in the United States the legal professionals were trained and imported from England.<ref>Stein (1981), 438.</ref> A formal apprenticeship or clerkship program was established first in New York in 1730—at that time a seven-year clerkship was required, and in 1756 a four-year college degree was required in addition to five years of clerking and an examination.<ref name="Stein_1981_439">Stein (1981), 439.</ref> Later the requirements were reduced to require only two years of college education.<ref name="Stein_1981_439" /> But a system like the Inns did not develop, and a college education was not required in England until the 19th century, so this system was unique.

The clerkship program required much individual study and the mentoring lawyer was expected to carefully select materials for study and guide the clerk in his study of the law and ensure that it was being absorbed.<ref>Moline (2003), 781.</ref> The student was supposed to compile his notes of his reading of the law into a "[[commonplace book]]", which he would try to memorize.<ref name="Moline_2003_782">Moline (2003), 782.</ref> Although those were the ideals, in reality the clerks were often overworked and rarely were able to study the law individually as expected. They were often employed to tedious tasks, such as making handwritten copies of documents. Finding sufficient legal texts was also a seriously debilitating issue, and there was no standardization in the books assigned to the clerk trainees because they were assigned by their mentor, whose opinion of the law may have differed greatly from his peers.<ref>Moline (2003), 782 and 783.</ref> It was said by one famous attorney in the U.S., [[William Livingston]], in 1745 in a New York newspaper that the clerkship program was severely flawed, and that most mentors "have no manner of concern for their clerk's future welfare... [T]is a monstrous absurdity to suppose, that the law is to be learnt by a perpetual copying of precedents".<ref name="Moline_2003_782" /> There were some few mentors that were dedicated to the service, and because of their rarity, they became so sought after that the first law schools evolved from the offices of some of these attorneys who took on many clerks and began to spend more time training than practicing law.<ref name="Moline_2003_782" />

In time, the apprenticeship program was not considered sufficient to produce lawyers fully capable of serving their clients' needs.<ref>Sonsteng, J. (2007). "[http://ssrn.com/abstract=1084098 A Legal Education Renaissance: A Practical Approach for the Twenty-First Century]". William Mitchell Law Review, Vol. 34, No. 1, Revised 2 April 2008. Accessed 26 May 2008. page 13.</ref> The apprenticeship programs often employed the trainee with menial tasks, and while they were well trained in the day-to-day operations of a law office, they were generally unprepared practitioners or legal reasoners.<ref>Stein (1981).</ref> The establishment of formal faculties of law in U.S. universities did not occur until the latter part of the 18th century.<ref>Stein (1981), 442.</ref> With the beginning of the American Revolution, the supply of lawyers from Britain ended. The first law degree granted by a U.S. university was a Bachelor of Law in 1793 by the [[College of William and Mary]], which was abbreviated L.B.; Harvard was the first university to use the LL.B. abbreviation in the United States.<ref>Kirkwood, M. and Owens, W. [http://www.law.stanford.edu/school/history/historysls.pdf A Brief History of the Stanford Law School, 1893–1946] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120407053200/http://www.law.stanford.edu/school/history/historysls.pdf |date=7 April 2012 }}, Stanford University School of Law.

The first university law programs in the United States, such as that of the [[University of Maryland School of Law|University of Maryland]] established in 1812, included much theoretical and philosophical study, including works such as the Bible, [[Cicero]], [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]], Aristotle, Adam Smith, [[Montesquieu]] and [[Grotius]].<ref>Moline (2003), 794.</ref> It has been said that the early university law schools of the early 19th century seemed to be preparing students for careers as [[politician|statesmen]] rather than as lawyers.<ref>Moline (2003), 795.</ref> At the LL.B. programs in the early 1900s at [[Stanford University]] and [[Yale]] continued to include "cultural study", which included courses in languages, mathematics and economics.<ref>Kirkwood, 19.</ref> An LL.B., or Bachelor of Laws, recognized that a prior bachelor's degree was not required to earn an LL.

In the 1850s there were many proprietary schools which originated from a practitioner taking on multiple apprentices and establishing a school and which provided a practical legal education, as opposed to the one offered in the universities which offered an education in the theory, history and philosophy of law.<ref name="Sonsteng_2007_15">Sonsteng (2007), 15.</ref> The universities assumed that the acquisition of skills would happen in practice, while the proprietary schools concentrated on the practical skills during education.<ref name="Sonsteng_2007_15" />

====Revolutionary approach: scientific study of law====
[[File:Joseph Story.jpg|thumb|[[Joseph Story]], U.S. Supreme Court Justice, lecturer of law at Harvard and proponent of the scientific study of law]]
In part to compete with the small professional law schools, there began a great change in U.S. university legal education. For a short time beginning in 1826 Yale began to offer a complete "practitioners' course" which lasted two years and included practical courses, such as pleading drafting.<ref name="moline2003">Moline (2003), p. 798.</ref> U.S. Supreme Court justice [[Joseph Story]] started the spirit of change in legal education at Harvard when he advocated a more "scientific study" of the law in the 19th century.<ref>Moline (2003), p. 800.</ref>  At the time he was a lecturer at Harvard. Therefore, at Harvard the education was much of a trade school type of approach to legal education, contrary to the more liberal arts education advocated by Blackstone at Oxford and Jefferson at William and Mary.<ref name="moline20032003">Moline (2003), p. 801.</ref> Nonetheless there continued to be debate among educators over whether legal education should be more vocational, as at the private law schools, or through a rigorous scientific method, such as that developed by Story and [[Christopher Columbus Langdell|Langdell]].<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://digitalcommons.pace.edu/lawfaculty/228/ |title=The Path of Legal Education from Edward to Langdell: A History of Insular Reaction|journal=Chicago-Kent Law Review|volume=57|issue=2|page=445|date= 1981|author=Ralph Michael Stein}}</ref>{{refn|For detailed discussions of the development of Langdell's method, see LaPiana (1994)<ref>{{cite book|url=https://www.questia.com/read/90428553?title=Logic%20and%20Experience%3a%20The%20Origin%20of%20Modern%20American%20Legal%20Education|title= Logic and Experience: The Origin of Modern American Legal Education]|publisher= New York and Oxford: [[Oxford University Press]]|author=William P.

Therefore, the modern legal education system in the U.S. is a combination of teaching law as a science and a practical skill,<ref>Moline (2003), p. 802.</ref> implementing elements such as clinical training, which has become an essential part of legal education in the U.S. and in the J.D. program of study.<ref>Sonsteng (2007), p. 19.</ref>

==Creation of the J.D. and major common law approaches to legal education==
The J.D. originated in the United States during a movement to improve training of the professions. Prior to the origination of the J.D., law students began law school either with only a high school diploma, or less than the amount of undergraduate study required to earn a bachelor's degree. The LL.B. persisted through the middle of the 20th century, after which a completed bachelor's degree became a requirement for virtually all students entering law school. The didactic approaches that resulted were revolutionary for university education and have slowly been implemented outside the U.S., but only recently (since about 1997) and in stages. The degrees which resulted from this new approach, such as the M.D. and the J.D., are just as different from their European counterparts as the educational approaches differ.

===Legal education in the United States===

Professional doctorates were developed in the United States in the 19th century, the first being the Doctor of Medicine in 1807,<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/stream/trainingforpubl00goog#page/n184/mode/2up|author=Reed, A. |date=1921|title=Training for the Public Profession of the Law|work= Carnegie's Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, Bulletin 15.|publisher=Boston: Merrymount Press|page=162}}</ref> but the professional law degree took more time. At the time the legal system in the United States was still in development as the educational institutions were developing. The status of the legal profession was at that time still ambiguous; therefore, the development of the legal degree took much time.<ref name="reed1921">{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/stream/trainingforpubl00goog#page/n186/mode/2up|author=Reed, A. |date=1921|title=Training for the Public Profession of the Law|work= Carnegie's Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, Bulletin 15.|publisher=Boston: Merrymount Press|page=165}}</ref> Even when some universities offered training in law, they did not offer a degree.<ref name="reed1921"/> Because in the United States there were no Inns of Court, and the English academic degrees did not provide the necessary professional training, the models from England were inapplicable, and the degree program took some time to develop.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/stream/trainingforpubl00goog#page/n186/mode/2up|author=Reed, A. |date=1921|title=Training for the Public Profession of the Law|work= Carnegie's Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, Bulletin 15.|publisher=Boston: Merrymount Press|page=164}}</ref> 

At first the degree took the form of a B.L. (such as at the College of William and Mary), but then Harvard, keen on importing legitimacy through the trappings of Oxford and Cambridge, implemented an LL.B. degree.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/stream/trainingforpubl00goog#page/n188/mode/2up|author=Reed, A. |date=1921|title=Training for the Public Profession of the Law|work= Carnegie's Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, Bulletin 15.|publisher=Boston: Merrymount Press|page=167}}</ref> The decision to award a bachelor's degree for law could be due to the fact that admittance to most nineteenth-century American law schools required only satisfactory completion of high school.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://asklib.law.harvard.edu/faq/115308|title=What is the difference between the LL.B. degree and the J.D.degree? - Ask a Librarian!|website=asklib.law.harvard.edu|access-date=19 January 2020}}</ref> The degree was nevertheless somewhat controversial at the time because it was a professional training without any of the cultural or classical studies required of a degree in England,<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/stream/trainingforpubl00goog#page/n182/mode/2up|author=Reed, A. |date=1921|title=Training for the Public Profession of the Law|work= Carnegie's Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, Bulletin 15.|publisher=Boston: Merrymount Press|page=161}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jDM7AQAAIAAJ|title=Present-day Law Schools in the United States and Canada|work= Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, Bulletin 21|publisher= Boston: Merrymount Press|author=Alfred Zantzinger Reed|year=1928}}</ref> where it was necessary to gain a general BA prior to an LLB or BCL until the nineteenth century.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jDM7AQAAIAAJ|title=Present-day Law Schools in the United States and Canada|work= Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, Bulletin 21|publisher= Boston: Merrymount Press|page=78|author=Alfred Zantzinger Reed|year=1928}}</ref> Thus, even though the name of the English LL.B. degree was implemented at Harvard, the program in the U.S. was nonetheless intended as a first degree which, unlike the English B.A., gave practical or professional training in law.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jDM7AQAAIAAJ|title=Present-day Law Schools in the United States and Canada|work= Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, Bulletin 21|publisher= Boston: Merrymount Press|page=74|author=Alfred Zantzinger Reed|year=1928}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/stream/trainingforpubl00goog#page/n190/mode/2up|author=Reed, A. |date=1921|title=Training for the Public Profession of the Law|work= Carnegie's Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, Bulletin 15.|publisher=Boston: Merrymount Press|page=169}}</ref>

====Creation of the Juris Doctor====

In the mid-19th century there was much concern about the quality of legal education in the United States. [[Christopher Columbus Langdell]], who served as dean of [[Harvard Law School]] from 1870 to 1895, dedicated his life to reforming [[legal education]] in the United States. The historian Robert Stevens wrote that "it was Langdell's goal to turn the legal profession into a university educated one—and not at the undergraduate level, but through a three-year post baccalaureate degree."<ref name="auto"/> This graduate level study would allow the intensive legal training that Langdell had developed, known as the [[casebook method|case method]] (a method of studying landmark cases) and the [[Socratic method]] (a method of examining students on the reasoning of the court in the cases studied). Therefore, a graduate high level law degree was proposed, the Juris Doctor, implementing the case and Socratic methods as its didactic approach.<ref>Harno, A. (2004) [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=PEVayHaV4XYC&oi=fnd&pg=PA1&dq=history+of+legal+education&ots=AszgnpjJuy&sig=KF4jCw63Gr3fftEOFjT5X5QcccM#PPA16,M1 Legal Education in the United States], New Jersey: Lawbook Exchange, page 50.</ref> According to professor [[Joseph Henry Beale|J. H. Beale]], an 1882 Harvard Law graduate, one of the main arguments for the change was uniformity. Harvard's four professional schools of theology, law, medicine and arts and sciences were all graduate schools, and their degrees were therefore a second degree. Two of them conferred a doctorate and the other two a baccalaureate degree. The change from LL.B. to J.D. was intended to end "this discrimination, the practice of conferring what is normally a first degree upon persons who have already their primary degree".<ref name="ThayerCastle1902">{{cite book

|chapter=Shall the degree be J. D. instead of LL. B.}}</ref> The J.D. was proposed as the equivalent of the J.U.D. in Germany to reflect the advanced study required to be an effective lawyer.

The [[University of Chicago Law School]] was the first to offer the J.D. in 1902, <ref>Herbermann, 112–117.</ref> when it was just one of five law schools that demanded a college degree from its applicants.<ref name=":0" /> While approval was still pending at Harvard, the degree was introduced at many other law schools including at the law schools at NYU, Berkeley, Michigan and Stanford. Because of tradition, and concerns about less prominent universities implementing a J.D. program, prominent eastern law schools like those of Harvard, Yale and Columbia refused to implement the degree. Harvard, for example, refused to adopt the J.D. degree, even though it restricted admission to students with college degrees in 1909.<ref name=":2" /> Indeed, pressure from eastern law schools led almost every law school (except at the University of Chicago and other law schools in Illinois) to abandon the J.D. and readopt the LL.B. as the first law degree by the 1930s.<ref>David Perry, "How Did Lawyers Become 'Doctors'?", ''New York State Bar Journal'', June 2012, 20 at p. 21, available at [http://www.heinonline.org Heinonline] (login required).</ref> By 1962, the J.D. degree was rarely seen outside the Midwest.<ref name=":2" />

After the 1930s, the LL.B. and the J.D. degrees coexisted in some American law schools. Some law schools, especially in Illinois and the Midwest, awarded both (like Marquette University, beginning in 1926), conferring J.D. degrees only to those with a bachelor's degree (as opposed to two or three years of college before law school), those who had a higher academic standard in undergraduate studies, and finished a thesis in the third year of law school.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=https://law.marquette.edu/facultyblog/2012/01/why-the-law-degree-is-called-a-j-d-and-not-an-ll-b/|title=Why the law degree is called a J.D. and not an LL.B.|last=Hylton|first=J. Gordon|date=11 January 2012|website=Marquette University Law School Faculty Blog|access-date=}}</ref> Because the J.D. degree was no more advantageous for bar admissions or for employment, the vast majority of Marquette students preferred to seek the LL.B. degree.<ref name=":1" />

As more law students entered law schools with college degrees in the 1950s and 1960s, a number of law schools may have introduced the J.D. to encourage law students to complete their undergraduate degrees.<ref name=":1" /> As late as 1961, there were still 15 ABA-accredited law schools in the United States which awarded both LL.B. and J.D. degrees. Thirteen of the 15 were located in the Midwest, which may indicate regional variations in the U.S.<ref name=":1" />

It was only after 1962 that a new push—this time begun at less-prominent law schools—successfully led to the universal adoption of the J.D. as the first law degree. The turning point appears to have occurred when the ABA Section of Legal Education and Admissions to the Bar unanimously adopted a resolution recommending to all approved law schools that they give favorable consideration to the conferring of the J.D. Degree as the first professional degree, in 1962 and 1963.<ref name=":0" /> By the 1960s, most law students were college graduates, and by the end of that decade, almost all were required to be.<ref name=":2" /> Student and alumni support were key in the LL.B.-to-J.D. change, and even the most prominent schools were convinced to make the change: Columbia and Harvard in 1969, and Yale, last, in 1971.<ref>David Perry, "How Did Lawyers Become 'Doctors'?", ''New York State Bar Journal'', June 2012, 20 at pp. 22-23, available at [http://www.heinonline.org Heinonline] (login required); see also {{cite web |url=http://asklib.law.harvard.edu/a.php?qid=37309 |title=What is the difference between the LL.B. degree and the J.D.degree? |publisher=asklib.law.harvard.edu |accessdate=26 August 2012 }}; Schoenfeld, M.

[[File:Langdell.jpg|frame|right|Christopher Langdell, one of the scholars at Harvard who established the J.D.]]

===Major common law approaches===
{{see also|Legal education in the United Kingdom}}
The English legal system is the root of the systems of other common-law countries, such as the United States. Originally, common lawyers in England were trained exclusively in the Inns of Court. Even though it took nearly 150 years since common law education began with Blackstone at Oxford for university education to be part of legal training in England and Wales, the LL.B. eventually became the degree usually taken before becoming a lawyer. In England and Wales the LL.B. is an undergraduate scholarly program and although it (assuming it is a qualifying law degree) fulfills the academic requirements for becoming a lawyer,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.barstandardsboard.org.uk/media/1590677/joint_announcement_1999_-_academic_stage.doc|title=Joint Announcement|publisher=The Law Society and the General Council of the Bar|date=1999|accessdate=16 September 2016}}</ref> further vocational and professional training as either a barrister (the [[Bar Professional Training Course]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.barstandardsboard.org.uk/qualifying-as-a-barrister/current-requirements/bar-professional-training-course/|title=Bar Professional Training Course|publisher=[[Bar Standards Board]]|accessdate=16 September 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160920171233/https://www.barstandardsboard.org.uk/qualifying-as-a-barrister/current-requirements/bar-professional-training-course/|archive-date=20 September 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> followed by [[pupillage]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.barstandardsboard.org.uk/qualifying-as-a-barrister/current-requirements/pupillage/|title=Pupillage|publisher=[[Bar Standards Board]]|accessdate=16 September 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160920170953/https://www.barstandardsboard.org.uk/qualifying-as-a-barrister/current-requirements/pupillage/|archive-date=20 September 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>) or as a solicitor (the [[Legal Practice Course]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sra.org.uk/students/lpc.page|title= Legal Practice Course (LPC)|publisher=[[Solicitors Regulation Authority]]|accessdate=16 September 2016}}</ref> followed by a "[[training contract|period of recognised training]]"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sra.org.uk/trainees/period-recognised-training.page|title= Period of recognised training|publisher=[[Solicitors Regulation Authority]]|accessdate=16 September 2016}}</ref>) is required before becoming licensed in that jurisdiction.<ref name=Langbein1996>{{cite web|url=https://www.law.yale.edu/system/files/documents/pdf/Faculty/Langbein_Scholarly_and_Professional_Objectives_in_Legal_Education.pdf|author=John H.

Legal education in Canada has unique variations from other Commonwealth countries. Even though the legal system of Canada is mostly a transplant of the English system (Quebec excepted), the Canadian system is unique in that there are no Inns of Court, the practical training occurs in the office of a barrister and solicitor with law society membership, and, since 1889, a university degree has been a prerequisite to initiating an articling clerkship.<ref>Reed (1921), 27.</ref> The education in law schools in Canada was similar to that in the United States at the turn of the 20th century, but with a greater concentration on statutory drafting and interpretation, and elements of a liberal education.<ref name="reed1928">Reed (1928), 390.</ref> The bar associations in Canada were influenced by the changes at Harvard, and were sometimes quicker to nationally implement the changes proposed in the United States, such as requiring previous college education before studying law.<ref name="reed1928"/>

==Modern variants and curriculum==
Legal education is rooted in the history and structure of the legal system of the jurisdiction where the education is given; therefore, law degrees are vastly different from country to country, making comparisons among degrees problematic.<ref>See, Langbein (1996).</ref> This has proven true in the context of the various forms of the J.D. which have been implemented around the world.

Until about 1997 the J.D. was unique to law schools in the U.S. But with the rise in international success of law firms from the United States, and the rise in students from outside the U.S. attending U.S. law schools, attorneys with the J.D. have become increasingly common internationally.<ref name="allard.ubc.ca">{{cite web|url=http://allard.ubc.ca/news-events/news-room/ubc-board-governors-approves-request-llb-bachelor-laws-degree-be-renamed-jd |title=Peter A.

(Juris Doctor) |website=Allard.ubc.ca |date= |accessdate=17 April 2017}}</ref> Therefore, the prestige of the J.D. has also risen, and many universities outside the U.S. have started to offer the J.D., often for the express purpose of raising the prestige of their law school and graduates.<ref name="allard.ubc.ca"/> Such institutions usually aim to appropriate the name of the degree only, and sometimes the new J.D. program of study is the same as that of their traditional law degree, which is usually more scholarly in purpose than the professional training intended with the J.D. as created in the U.S.  Scholarly works are deemed only persuasive, and not binding on the courts. As such, various characteristics can therefore be seen among J.D. degrees as implemented in universities around the world.

===Types and characteristics===

Until very recently, only law schools in the United States offered the ''Juris Doctor''. Starting about 1997, universities in other countries began introducing the J.D. as a first professional degree in law, with differences appropriate to the legal systems of the countries in which these law schools are situated.

====Standard ''Juris Doctor'' curriculum====
{{See also|Law school in the United States#Curriculum}}

As stated by James Hall and Langdell, two people who were involved in the creation of the J.D., the J.D. is a professional degree like the [[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]], intended to prepare practitioners through a [[Juris Doctor#Revolutionary approach: Scientific study of law|scientific approach]] of analysing and teaching the law through logic and adversarial analysis (such as the [[Casebook method|casebook]] and [[Socratic method#Law schools|Socratic]] methods).<ref>Hall, J.

As a professional training, it provides sufficient training for entry into practice (no apprenticeship is necessary to sit for the bar exam). It requires at least three academic years of full-time study. While the J.D. is a doctoral degree in the US, lawyers usually use the suffix "[[esquire|Esq.]]" as opposed to the prefix "Dr." 

====Replacement for the LL.B.====
An initial attempt to rename the LL.B. to the J.D. in the US in the early 20th century started with a petition at Harvard in 1902. This was rejected, but the idea took hold at the new law school established at the [[University of Chicago]] and other universities and by 1925 80% of US law schools gave the J.D. to graduate entrants, while restricting undergraduate entrants (who followed the same curriculum) to the LL.B. Yet the change was rejected by Harvard, Yale and Columbia, and by the late 1920s schools were moving away from the J.D. and once again granting only the LL.B, with only Illinois law schools holding out. This changed in the 1960s, by which time almost all law school entrants were graduates. The J.D. was reintroduced in 1962 and by 1971 had replaced the LL.B., again without any change in the curriculum, with many schools going as far as to offer a J.D. to their LL.B. alumni for a small fee.<ref name=":2">{{cite web|url=http://www.mobar.org/uploadedFiles/Home/Publications/Precedent/2013/Winter/doctors.pdf|title=HOW DID LAWYERS BECOME "DOCTORS"?

Canadian and Australian universities have law programs that are very similar to the J.D. programs in the United States. These include Queen's University, University of British Columbia, University of Alberta, University of Victoria, Université de Moncton, University of Calgary, University of Saskatchewan, University of Manitoba, University of Windsor, University of Ottawa, University of Western Ontario, York University<ref>Belford, T.

====Australia====
<!-- Note: the programme is usually called the "JD" in Australia, not the "J.D." -->
The traditional law degree in Australia is the undergraduate Bachelor of Laws ([[Bachelor of Laws#Australia|LLB]]); however, there has been a huge shift towards the JD in the past five years, with some Australian universities now offering a JD programme, including the country's best ranked universities (e.g. The [[University of New South Wales]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.law.unsw.edu.au/future-students/unsw-jd |title=Unsw Jd &#124; Law |website=Law.unsw.edu.au |date=7 April 2017 |accessdate=17 April 2017}}</ref> the [[University of Sydney]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sydney.edu.au/law/fstudent/jd/program.shtml |title=The Sydney Juris Doctor (JD) - Future Students - The University of Sydney |website=Sydney.edu.au |date=30 March 2017 |accessdate=17 April 2017}}</ref> the [[Australian National University]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://law.anu.edu.au/study/study-programs/anu-juris-doctor |title=The ANU Juris Doctor - ANU College of Law - ANU |website=Law.anu.edu.au |date=10 August 2015 |accessdate=17 April 2017}}</ref> the [[University of Melbourne]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://law.unimelb.edu.au/study/jd |title=The Melbourne JD (Juris Doctor) : Melbourne Law School |location=AU |website=Law.unimelb.edu.au |date= |accessdate=17 April 2017}}</ref> and [[Monash University]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://monash.edu/pubs/2019handbooks/courses/L6005.html|title=Monash University Handbook|website=Monash University}}</ref>).

Generally, universities that offer the JD also offer the LLB, though at some universities, only the JD is offered, and only at postgraduate levels. Due to recent changes in undergraduate degree structuring, some universities, such as the University of Melbourne,<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/education/a-decade-into-the-melbourne-model-young-graduates-give-their-assessment-20150930-gjxt3u.html |title=A decade into the Melbourne Model, young graduates give their assessment |website=Smh.com.au |date=4 October 2015 |accessdate=17 April 2017}}</ref> only allow law to be studied at the postgraduate level, and the JD has completely replaced the LLB.

An Australian ''Juris Doctor'' consists of three years of full-time study, or the equivalent. The course varies across different universities, though all are obliged to teach the [[Priestley 11]] subjects as per the requirements of the state admissions boards in Australia.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.lawadmissions.vic.gov.au/qualifications-and-training/academic|title=Academic|first=Victorian Legal Admissions|last=Board|website=www.lawadmissions.vic.gov.au}}</ref> JDs are considered equivalent to the LLBs, and still need to fulfill the same requirements practical legal training for admission as a lawyer.

On the [[Australian Qualifications Framework]], the ''Juris Doctor'' is classified as a "masters degree (extended)",<!-- note the official name for this class of qualifications does *not* include an apostrophe - see citations to the AQF in this paragraph --> with an exception having been granted to use the title ''Juris Doctor'' (other such exceptions include Doctor of Medicine, Doctor of Dentistry and Doctor of Veterinary Medicine). It may not be described as a doctoral degree, and holders may not use the title "doctor". Along with other extended master's degrees, the JD takes three to four years following a minimum of a three-year bachelor's degree.<ref name="AQF titles">{{cite web|url=http://www.aqf.edu.au/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/AQF-qualification-titles-PDF-2B3-1b.pdf|title=AQF qualification titles|publisher=Australian Qualifications Framework Council|accessdate=16 September 2016|date=June 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161213104206/http://www.aqf.edu.au/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/aqf-qualification-titles-pdf-2b3-1b.pdf|archivedate=13 December 2016}}</ref><ref name="AQF addendum">{{cite web|url=http://www.aqf.edu.au/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/AQF-Addendum-2014.pdf|title=Addendum to AQF Second Edition January 2013: Amended Qualification Type: Masters Degree|accessdate=16 September 2016|date=May 2014|publisher=Australian Qualifications Framework Council|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220022220/http://www.aqf.edu.au/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/AQF-Addendum-2014.pdf|archivedate=20 December 2016}}</ref>

====Mexico====
To become a licensed lawyer, a person must hold the Licenciado en Derecho degree obtainable by four to five years of academic study and final examination. After these undergraduate studies it is possible to obtain a Maestría degree, equivalent to a master's degree. This degree requires two to three years of academic studies. Finally, one can study for an additional three years to obtain the Doctor en Derecho degree, which is a research degree at doctoral level.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aragon.unam.mx/oferta_educativa/posgrados/derecho/doc_derecho.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101202024354/http://www.aragon.unam.mx/oferta_educativa/posgrados/derecho/doc_derecho.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=2 December 2010|title=Doctorado en Derecho|publisher=UNAM|accessdate=16 September 2016}}</ref> Since most universities and law schools must have approval from the ministry of education (Secretaría de Educación Pública) through the general office of professions (Direccion General de Profesiones) all of the academic programs are similar throughout the country in public and private law schools.

====Philippines====
In the [[Philippines]], the J.D. exists alongside the more common LL.B. Like the standard LL.B, it requires four years of study; is considered a graduate degree and requires prior undergraduate study as a prerequisite for admission, and covers the core subjects required for the bar examinations. However, the J.D. requires students to finish the core bar subjects in just 2½ years; take elective courses (such as legal theory, philosophy, and sometimes even theology); undergo an apprenticeship; and write and defend a thesis.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ateneolaw.ateneo.edu/index.php?p=93&PHPSESSID=3de3cb420701c7a80495dc7f3ea2679c |title=&#124; Ateneo de Manila University |website=Ateneolaw.ateneo.edu |date=10 February 2017 |accessdate=17 April 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://ateneolaw.ateneo.edu/index.php?p=93&PHPSESSID=04d268c43e1b638ebebab5e5c486677a |title=Ateneo de Manila Law School - Philippine Leadership Crisis and the J.D.

==In academia==
In the United States, the Juris Doctor is the degree that prepares the recipient to enter the law profession (as do the [[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]] or [[Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine|D.O.]] in the medical profession and the [[Doctor of Dental Surgery|D.D.S]] or [[Docter of Dental Medicine|D.D.M.]] in the dental profession). While the J.D. is the sole degree necessary to become a professor of law or to obtain a license to practice law, it (like the M.D., D.O, D.D.S, or D.M.D.) is not a "research degree".<ref>Kenneth Kaoma Mwenda, Gerry Nkombo Muuka (eds.), "The Challenge of Change in Africa's Higher Education in the 21st Century", Cambria Press (2009) [https://www.amazon.com/dp/1604976101]; see esp.

==Use of the title "Doctor"==

It has not been customary in the United States to address holders of the J.D. as "doctor". It was noted in the 1920s, when the title was widely used by people with doctorates (even those that, at the time, were undergraduate qualifications) and others, that the J.D. stood out from other doctorates in this respect.<ref>{{cite journal|jstor=1487677|title=Who Is a Doctor?|author=A.

Crabbe|journal=Peabody Journal of Education|volume=2|issue=5|date=March 1925|pages=268–273|doi=10.1080/01619562509534672}}</ref> This continues to be the case in general today.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.formsofaddress.info/attorney.html|title=How to Address an Attorney or Lawyer In the United States|publisher=Protocol School of Washington|author=Robert Hickey}}</ref>

In the late 1960s, the rising number of American law schools awarding J.D.s led to debate over whether lawyers could ethically use the title "Doctor". Initial informal ethics opinions, based on the Canons of Professional Ethics then in force, came down against this.<ref>{{cite journal |jstor=25724462|journal=American Bar Association Journal|date=July 1968|title= Summaries of Informal Opinions of the Standing Committee on Professional Ethics |volume= 54|issue= 7|page= 657|quote = 1001.

As not all state bars adopted the new Code and some omitted the clause permitting the use of the title, confusion over whether lawyers could ethically use the title "Doctor" continued.<ref>{{cite journal |jstor=27846360|journal=American Bar Association Journal|date=November 2006|title= LAWYERS ARE DOCTORS, TOO: But There is No Clear Ethics Rule on Whether They May Say So|volume= 92|issue= 11|page=24|author=Kathleen Maher}}</ref> While many state bars now allow the use of the title, some prohibit its use where there is any chance of confusing the public about a lawyer's actual qualifications (e.g. if the public might be left with the impression that the lawyer is a doctor of medicine).<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/johnson/2013/03/professional-titles|work =[[The Economist]]|title=Trust me, I'm a doctor of law|date=1 March 2013|author=S.A.P.}}</ref> There has been discussion on whether it is permissible in some other limited instances. For example, in June 2006, the Florida Bar Board of Governors ruled that a lawyer could refer to himself as a "doctor en leyes" (doctor in laws) in a Spanish-language advertisement, reversing an earlier decision.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.floridabar.org/DIVCOM/JN/JNnews01.nsf/Articles/7CA2D2C795627B038525719A0047170E|title=Debate over 'doctor of law' title continues|date =1 July 2006 |author= Gary Blankenship|work=The Florida Bar News}}</ref> The decision was reversed again in July 2006, when the board voted to only allow the names of degrees to appear in the language used on the diploma, without translation.<ref>{{cite web  |url=http://www.floridabar.org/DIVCOM/JN/JNNews01.nsf/Articles/E568F349EA03E82C852571C40052C818|title=Bar board settles Dr. of Law debate|date=15 August 2006|author= Gary Blankenship|work=The Florida Bar News}}</ref>

''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' notes specifically in its stylebook that "Lawyers, despite their J.D. degrees, aren't called ''doctor''{{-"}}, although the title is used (if preferred and if appropriate in context) for "individuals who hold Ph.D.s and other doctoral degrees" and for "those who are generally called doctor in their professions in the U.S."<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3mjxg9iNAQUC&pg=PA72|page=72|author=Paul Martin|date=15 June 2010|publisher=[[Simon and Schuster]]|title=The Wall Street Journal Guide to Business Style and Us|isbn=9781439122693}}</ref> Many other newspapers reserve the title for physicians<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2009/feb/02/nation/na-dr-jill-biden2|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=2 February 2009|author=Robin Abcarian|quote=Newspapers, including The Times, generally do not use the honorific 'Dr.' unless the person in question has a medical degree.|title=Hi, I'm Jill.

They later amended the article to note that the use of the title by lawyers "is a (begrudgingly) accepted practice in some states and not in others", although they maintained that it was rarely used as it "suggests that you're a medical doctor or a Ph.D.—and therefore conveys a false level of expertise".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2011/08/michele-bachmann-not-doctor-phd|title=Michele Bachmann Is Not a Doctor|work=Mother Jones|author=Tim Murphy|date=18 August 2011}}</ref>
