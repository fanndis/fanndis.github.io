'''Yes Scotland''' was the organisation representing the parties, organisations, and individuals campaigning for a ''Yes'' vote in the [[2014 Scottish independence referendum]]. It was launched on 25 May 2012 and dissolved in late 2014 after Scotland voted against independence.

Yes Scotland's chief executive was [[Blair Jenkins]], and [[Dennis Canavan]] was the chair of its advisory board.<ref>{{cite news|title=Scottish independence: Blair Jenkins OBE named Yes Scotland chief|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-18610027|newspaper=BBC News|date=28 June 2012|accessdate=20 September 2014}}</ref> Stephen Noon, a long term employee and policy writer of the SNP, was Yes Scotland's chief strategist.

By the formal start of the referendum campaign period in May 2014, it had become the "biggest grassroots movement in Scottish political history", said Jenkins.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/scottish-independence-vote-supporters-are-biggest-grassroots-movement-9457481.html |title=Scottish independence vote: Supporters are 'biggest grassroots movement' |first=Nigel |last=Morris |work=[[The Independent]] |date=30 May 2014 |accessdate=30 June 2016}}</ref> The campaign did not win independence, but "transformed politics in Scotland", suggested ''[[The Herald (Glasgow)|The Herald]]''.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/13181050.It_failed_to_win_independence_but_Yes_transformed_politics_in_Scotland_and_changed_the_UK_forever/ |title=It failed to win independence but Yes transformed politics in Scotland and changed the UK forever |first=Paul |last=Hutcheon |work=[[Sunday Herald]] |date=21 September 2014 |accessdate=30 June 2016}}</ref>

==History==
[[File:F0835584.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Yes Scotland activists at demonstration]]
It was launched in [[Edinburgh]] on 25 May 2012.<ref name="One Million">{{cite news|title=Scottish independence: One million Scots urged to sign 'yes' declaration|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-18162832|newspaper=[[BBC News]]|date=25 May 2012|accessdate=20 September 2014}}</ref> The launch featured actors Alan Cumming and Brian Cox.

A few days after the official launch, the campaign was forced to make changes to its website; this was after people who followed its Twitter feed had been listed on the website as supporters of the campaign.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-18272266 |title=Scottish independence: "Yes Scotland" website changes |work=BBC News |date=30 May 2012}}</ref>

Yes Scotland officially opened its [[campaign staff]] headquarters on 19 November 2012 in Hope Street, Glasgow. The headquarters were open to the public.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/politics/political-news/yes-scotland-opens-new-city-base.19469644 |first=Helen |last=McArdle |date=20 November 2012 |accessdate=22 April 2013 |title=Yes Scotland opens new city base |work=[[The Herald (Glasgow)|The Herald]] |publisher=Herald & Times Group}}</ref> By February 2013, Yes Scotland employed 17 people full-time.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/scottish-independence-blog/2013/feb/21/blairjenkins-yes-independence-campaign |title=Yes Scotland boss says referendum victory 'achievable' as his troops hit the streets |first=Severin |last=Carrell |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=21 February 2013 |accessdate=30 June 2016}}</ref>

In March 2013, a number of Yes Scotland activists promoted the movement at [[under-occupancy penalty|bedroom tax]] protests throughout Scotland.<ref>{{cite web|last=Peterkin|first=Tom|newspaper=The Scotsman|date=31 March 2013|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/bedroom-tax-thousands-protest-across-scotland-1-2868663|title=Bedroom tax: Thousands protest across Scotland|accessdate=20 September 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Thousands rally in Glasgow to protest Coalition's 'bedroom tax'|url=http://news.stv.tv/west-central/219553-protestors-to-demonstrate-in-glasgow-against-bedroom-tax-reforms/|accessdate=11 August 2013|publisher=[[STV (TV channel)|STV]]|date=30 March 2013}}</ref>

Yes Scotland first disclosed its finances in April 2013, revealing it had taken over £1.6m in donations.<ref name="donations">{{cite news |url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/home-news/yes-scotland-publish-list-of-donors-for-indyref-campaign.1365592289|title=Yes Scotland publish list of donors for indyref campaign|date=10 April 2013|accessdate=10 April 2013 |work=The Herald |publisher=Herald & Times Group}}</ref>

In July 2013, the ''Sunday Herald'' reported that there were "persistent rumours" of funding problems within Yes Scotland, and suggested that these were related to Jacqueline Caldwell and Susan Stewart leaving the campaign organisation. The organisation "shared out" the women's responsibilities between other employees instead of replacing them.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/politics/referendum-news/cash-questions-for-yes-scotland-as-another-senior-figure-quits-after-just-six-months.21537964|title=Cash questions for Yes Scotland as another senior figure quits after just six months|date=7 July 2013|accessdate=5 August 2013|work=The Herald |publisher=Herald & Times Group}}</ref>

Throughout 2013, Yes Scotland launched specially targeted campaign groups like ''Veterans for Independence'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/politics/referendum-news/independent-scotlands-armed-forces-should-focus-on-peace.21288225|title=Independent Scotland's armed forces 'should focus on peace'|date=8 June 2013|accessdate=5 August 2013|work=The Herald |publisher=Herald & Times Group}}</ref> ''Farming for Yes'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/politics/referendum-news/2014-yes-team-targets-farmers.21710623|title=2014 'Yes' team targets farmers|date=29 July 2013|accessdate=5 August 2013|work=The Herald |publisher=Herald & Times Group}}</ref> and ''Crofters for Yes''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/top-stories/scottish-independence-crofters-launch-campaign-1-3024857|title=Scottish independence: crofters launch campaign|date=1 August 2013|accessdate=5 August 2013|work=The Scotsman|publisher=Johnston Press}}</ref>

In August 2013, the chief executive of [[Better Together (campaign)|Better Together]], Blair MacDougall, accused figures within Yes Scotland of "copy[ing]" his campaign's slogan {{mdash}} "best of both worlds" {{mdash}} to "reassure voters over independence". In response, a senior [[Scottish National Party|SNP]] source said that "It's arrogant of the No campaign to claim ownership of language."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/top-stories/scottish-independence-row-over-campaign-phrase-1-3037380 |title=Scottish independence: Row over campaign phrase|accessdate=20 September 2014|work=The Scotsman|date=9 August 2013|first=Eddie|last=Barnes}}</ref>

Later in August, Yes Scotland filed a police complaint that its internal emails had been accessed illegitimately. Details of the particular email that was accessed were not initially released, but it was later revealed to be correspondence with Dr Elliot Bulmer in connection with an article he wrote for the ''Herald'' in July, ''A Scottish constitution to serve the commonweal''. Their campaign opponents, Better Together, accused Yes Scotland of "secretly paying off supposedly impartial experts" and urged an inquiry, as Dr Bulmer is research director of the Constitutional Commission, a registered charity which states that it has no political alignment. Yes Scotland said the payment was a "nominal fee for the considerable time and effort [Dr Bulmer] spent" on the piece, and its content was not influenced.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/home-news/yes-scotland-we-paid-academic-for-herald-article.1377140116|title= Political row after Yes Scotland say: we paid academic for Herald article |accessdate=20 September 2014|date=22 August 2013|work=The Herald|publisher=Herald & Times Group}}</ref>

Then, the ''Telegraph'' reported that [[Police Scotland]] were opening a hacking inquiry in response to a complaint received from the campaign about internal emails that appeared to have been accessed illegitimately and leaked to the media.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/scotland/scottish-politics/10253788/Yes-Scotland-calls-in-police-over-hacking-claim.html|title=Yes Scotland calls in police over hacking claim|date=20 August 2013|accessdate=20 August 2013|work=[[Telegraph Media Group|The Telegraph]]|first= Auslan |last=Cramb}}</ref>

At the end of 2014, chief executive Blair Jenkins sent a message to supporters to join the Scottish National Party, the Scottish Greens or the Scottish Socialist Party to ensure that campaigners "keep the spirit alive".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/top-stories/yes-scotland-signs-off-with-message-to-supporters-1-3639422|title=Yes Scotland signs off with message to supporters|date=19 December 2014|accessdate=26 December 2014|publisher=The Scotsman}}</ref>

==Participation==
The campaign was an alliance of the governing [[Scottish National Party]], the [[Scottish Socialist Party]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140628104858/http://www.yesscotland.net/about|title=About Yes Scotland|accessdate=6 June 2014|publisher=Yes Scotland}}</ref> and the [[Scottish Green Party]]. The Scottish Green Party co-convener [[Patrick Harvie]] helped launch the campaign but following this had expressed some reservations.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-19854178 |title=Scottish Greens debate 'Yes Scotland' membership |first=Raymond |last=Buchanan |work=BBC News |date=6 October 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/jun/10/scottish-greens-snp-independence-campaign |title=Scottish Greens pull back from SNP pro-independence campaign|accessdate=20 September 2014|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=10 June 2012|first=Severin |last=Carrell}}</ref> Harvie told the Green's conference in October 2012 that he felt the campaign had become fully inclusive, and the party members voted for "full participation" in the campaign.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-19858857|title=Scottish independence: Greens join Yes Scotland campaign|date=6 October 2012|accessdate=6 June 2014|publisher=BBC News}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/politics/referendum-news/greens-ditch-snp-puppet-fears-and-join-the-yes-scotland-campaign.19078970 |title=Greens ditch SNP 'puppet' fears and join the Yes Scotland campaign |first=Tom |last=Gordon |date=7 October 2012|accessdate=11 October 2014|work=The Herald |publisher=Herald & Times Group}}</ref> The organisation also collaborated with [[Labour for Independence]], an organisation for pro-independence supporters of the [[Scottish Labour Party]]. In 2013, Yes Scotland covered the £245 accommodation bill for LFI's first conference.<ref name="Herald Aug2013">{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/politics/referendum-news/fresh-questions-raised-over-pro-independence-groups-labour-credentials.21774204|title=Fresh questions raised over pro-independence group's Labour credentials|date=4 August 2013|accessdate=4 August 2013|work=The Herald |publisher=Herald & Times Group}}</ref>

Other groups supporting a ''Yes'' vote include [[Women for Independence]] and [[Business for Scotland]].

The campaign had endorsements by several high-profile figures residing outwith Scotland, including [[Hollywood]] actor [[Alan Cumming]], [[James Bond]] star [[Sean Connery|Sir Sean Connery]], and actor [[Brian Cox (actor)|Brian Cox]].<ref name="One Million"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/politics/scots-film-star-alan-cumming-1166242|title=Scots film star Alan Cumming ditches New York to back independence vote|accessdate=20 September 2014|date=7 July 2012|first=Toby |last=McDonald|work=[[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]]}}</ref>

==Donations==
In April 2013, the campaign revealed that it had received over £1.6m in donations since its launch the preceding May. Roughly £1.3m of this came from five donors, including the two [[EuroMillions]] winners, Christine and Colin Weir. A contribution to the value of £342,797 was provided by the [[Scottish National Party]] to "fund the start-up and staffing costs including the official launch on May 25, 2012".<ref name="donations" />

==Yes Declaration==
The campaign aimed to have one million residents of Scotland sign its "Yes Declaration", a statement of intent to support the independence of Scotland.<ref name="One Million"/> Signatures could be input electronically by supporters using the campaign's website, and were also collected by grassroots activists who were encouraged to campaign in their local communities and around Scotland at appropriate events. The declaration read:

{{cquote|I believe it is fundamentally better for us all, if decisions about Scotland's future are taken by the people who care most about Scotland, that is, by the people of Scotland.

Being independent means Scotland's future will be in Scotland's hands.

There is no doubt that Scotland has great potential. We are blessed with talent, resources and creativity. We have the opportunity to make our nation a better place to live, for this and future generations. We can build a greener, fairer and more prosperous society that is stronger and more successful than it is today.

I want a Scotland that speaks with her own voice and makes her own unique contribution to the world: a Scotland that stands alongside the other nations on these isles, as an independent nation.}}

The ''[[Sunday Mail (Scotland)|Sunday Mail]]'' newspaper reported that by 1 July 2012 approximately 22,000 people had signed the declaration and almost 8000 signed up to the cause on the first day, 'prompting organisers to remove a counter from their website'. The newspaper went further by stating that 'There was more embarrassment when it emerged they used actors in a picture on the site.'<ref name="SNP22,000">{{cite news| title = Embarrassment for SNP as only 22,000 Scots sign 'declaration of independence' | date = 1 July 2012 | url =http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/politics/embarrassment-for-snp-as-only-22000-scots-1165768| work= [[Sunday Mail (Scotland)|Sunday Mail]]|publisher=[[Trinity Mirror]]|first=Mark|last=Aitken|accessdate= 20 July 2012}}</ref> In September, [[Alex Salmond]] announced that Yes Scotland had gathered over 100,000 signatures for the Yes Declaration.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.snp.org/media-centre/news/2012/sep/salmond-announces-100000-signed-yes-declaration|title= Salmond announces 100,000 signed 'yes' declaration|publisher=[[Scottish National Party]]|date= 22 September 2012|accessdate=20 September 2014}}</ref> By [[St. Andrew's Day]] of the same year, the figure had risen to 143,000, to which a [[Better Together (campaign)|Better Together]] spokesman responded that ″If they want to sign up enough Scots to win a majority, they will still be chasing signatures in 2018"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-20539259 |title=Yes Scotland signs up 143,000 supporters |publisher=BBC News |date=30 November 2012 |accessdate=22 April 2013}}</ref> The total reached 372,103 by 24 May 2013,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/home-news/yes-scotland-hail-372000-independence-declaration-signatures.1369394211|title= Yes Scotland hail 372,000 Independence Declaration signatures|date= 24 May 2013|work=The Herald |publisher=Herald & Times Group|accessdate=20 September 2014}}</ref> and 789,191 by 9 June 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140925034557/http://yesscotland.net/news/100-days-go-yes-course-success-declaration-signatures-near-800000|title=With 100 days to go Yes is on course for success as Declaration signatures near 800,000|date=9 June 2014|accessdate=9 June 2014|publisher=Yes Scotland|first= Peter |last=Dempsie}}</ref> On 22 August 2014, Yes Scotland announced that they had exceeded their target of 1 million signatures.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-28894313|title=Scottish independence: Yes declaration hits million target|accessdate=20 September 2014|publisher=BBC News|date=22 August 2014}}</ref>
