'''''Lady Gaga and the Muppets Holiday Spectacular''''' is a [[List of Thanksgiving television specials|Thanksgiving television special]] with American singer [[Lady Gaga]] and [[the Muppets]]. The 90-minute program aired on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] on November 28, 2013, with guest stars [[Joseph Gordon-Levitt]], [[Elton John]] and [[RuPaul]] and an appearance by [[Kristen Bell]]. It was the second Gaga Thanksgiving special on ABC, after ''[[A Very Gaga Thanksgiving]]'' in 2011. The singer had previously collaborated with the Muppets on media appearances and in her shows.

The special featured songs from Gaga's third [[studio album]], ''[[Artpop]]'', and duets with the guest stars. Critics gave the special mixed reviews, with some praising Gaga for being relatable in the show. Other reviewers were disappointed with its lack of production ideas, other than as a promotion for ''Artpop''. It had lower [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]] than other Thanksgiving specials, with a total of 3.62 million viewers and a 0.9 rating in the adult age 18–49 demographic.

==Synopsis==
Announcer [[Tom Kane]] explains to [[Pepe the King Prawn]] that the special is being filmed for [[Lady Gaga]], the latter then appears and  explains why she invited the Muppets and then performs "[[Venus (Lady Gaga song)|Venus]]". After [[Statler and Waldorf]]'s review of the performance, [[Kristen Bell]] asks for Gaga's autograph. This annoys [[Miss Piggy]] who was planning her own finale and enlists the Muppets to hold auditions. Gaga performs "[[Applause (Lady Gaga song)|Applause]]", followed by "[[Bennie and the Jets]]" and "[[Artpop (song)|Artpop]]" with [[Elton John]] (with the Muppets joining them for the latter). After discussing ideas for the finale, Gaga performs "Manicure" and the Muppets talk about the most inappropriate gifts they ever received. [[Kermit the Frog]] joins Gaga in a duet of "[[Gypsy (Lady Gaga song)|Gypsy]]", and [[Joseph Gordon-Levitt]] duets on "[[Baby, It's Cold Outside]]". Kermit's friendship with Gaga angers Miss Piggy; after a performance of "Fashion!" by Gaga and [[RuPaul]], Miss Piggy bemoans the attention paid to the singer. Although she dreams of singing "[[Santa Baby]]", she is upstaged in her dream by [[Youthful Praise]]. After a trailer for the upcoming ''[[Muppets Most Wanted]]'', Gaga asks Miss Piggy to suggest a finale and reprises "Applause" with the Muppets.

In October 2013, the [[American Broadcasting Company]] (ABC) announced a 90-minute special entitled ''Lady Gaga and the Muppets' Holiday Spectacular''. It was the second [[List of Thanksgiving television specials|Thanksgiving television special]] on ABC by Gaga, after ''[[A Very Gaga Thanksgiving]]'' in 2011. The singer collaborated with the Muppets for the special, which aired on November 28, 2013. "I was so excited when ABC called me about doing a holiday special this year. I knew it just wouldn't be a complete night of laughter and memories without the Muppets! Can't wait to see the gang again, and I hope Miss Piggy's still not mad about Kermit ... We're just friends," Gaga said about the special.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/lady-gaga-teams-muppets-adorable-photos-result/story?id=20603044|title=Lady Gaga Teams Up With the Muppets and Adorable Photos Result|last=Messer|first=Lesley|date=October 17, 2013|publisher=[[American Broadcasting Company]]|accessdate=December 14, 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140318120644/https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/lady-gaga-teams-muppets-adorable-photos-result/story?id=20603044|archive-date=March 18, 2014}}</ref> Guest stars included [[Joseph Gordon-Levitt]], [[Elton John]] and [[RuPaul]], with an appearance by [[Kristen Bell]].<ref>{{Cite journal|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2013/10/17/lady-gaga-muppets-holiday-spectacular|title=Lady Gaga teams up with her littlest monsters, the Muppets, for another holiday spectacular|first=Jodi|last=Walker|accessdate=November 15, 2013|date=October 17, 2013|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]}}</ref> Gaga performed several songs from her third studio album, ''[[Artpop]]''.<ref name="rscelebrate">{{Cite journal|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/lady-gaga-to-celebrate-thanksgiving-with-the-muppets-20131018|title=Lady Gaga to Celebrate Thanksgiving With the Muppets|accessdate=November 15, 2013|date=October 18, 2013|first=Kory|last=Grow|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131028043301/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/lady-gaga-to-celebrate-thanksgiving-with-the-muppets-20131018|archive-date=October 28, 2013}}</ref> The singer had collaborated twice with the Muppets in the past; in 2009 Kermit the Frog was her date at the [[2009 MTV Video Music Awards]], and she featured [[Jim Henson's Creature Shop]] pieces on [[the Monster Ball Tour]] (2009–2011).<ref name=Marechal>{{cite journal|last=Marechal|first=AJ|title=ABC Sets Holiday Special with Lady Gaga and the Muppets|url=https://variety.com/2013/tv/news/abc-sets-holiday-special-with-lady-gaga-and-the-muppets-1200735249/|accessdate=October 17, 2013|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=October 17, 2013|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017223449/http://variety.com/2013/tv/news/abc-sets-holiday-special-with-lady-gaga-and-the-muppets-1200735249/|archive-date=October 17, 2013}}</ref>

===Critical response===
According to Marissa G. Muller of ''Rolling Stone'', Gaga "was at her most accessible during the show, sharing the difficulties of life on the road and her love of the holidays – specifically, how she grew up watching the Muppets and has had a long love for Kermit. The whole affair was relatively conservative for Gaga and weirdly progressive for the Muppets".<ref name="rsreview"/> Muller wrote that the special was aired at an opportune moment for Gaga, since ''Artpop''{{'s}} sales had dropped 82 percent in its second week and the show was hoped to woo back her audience. She called the opening performance of "Venus" one of its top moments.<ref name="rsreview">{{Cite journal|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/tv/news/five-memorable-moments-from-lady-gagas-muppets-holiday-spectacular-20131129|title=Five Memorable Moments From Lady Gaga's Muppets 'Holiday Spectacular'|accessdate=December 14, 2016|date=November 29, 2013|first=Marissa G.|last=Muller|work=Rolling Stone|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160924191323/http://www.rollingstone.com/tv/news/five-memorable-moments-from-lady-gagas-muppets-holiday-spectacular-20131129|archive-date=September 24, 2016}}</ref> Mark Graham wrote for [[VH1]] that Gaga had a lack of relatability at that point in her career: "To her credit, [she] seems to have recognized this flaw in her brand strategy and has been working overtime of late to humanize herself ... [Anyone] who watches the cable premiere of ''Lady Gaga & The Muppets Holiday Spectacular'' ... will definitely gain a new appreciation for [her]".<ref name="vh1review">{{Cite journal|url=http://www.vh1.com/news/52092/lady-gaga-muppets/|title=Five Memorable Moments From Lady Gaga & The Muppets' Holiday Spectacular|accessdate=December 14, 2016|date=November 29, 2013|first=Mark|last=Graham|publisher=[[VH1]]|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220200321/http://www.vh1.com/news/52092/lady-gaga-muppets/|archive-date=December 20, 2016}}</ref> Maricela Gonzalez of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' called ''Lady Gaga and the Muppets' Holiday Spectacular'' a "cross-promotional commercial", enabling Gaga to promote ''Artpop'' and enhancing the Muppets' popularity.

It’s Lady Gaga and the Muppets!"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2013/11/29/lady-gaga-muppets-holiday-spectacular-react|title='Lady Gaga & the Muppets' Holiday Spectacular' react: Cross-promotional cheer for one and all|work=Entertainment Weekly|first=Marcela|last=Gonzalez|date=November 29, 2013|accessdate=November 29, 2013|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161221104150/http://articles.latimes.com/2013/nov/29/entertainment/la-et-ms-lady-gaga-and-the-muppets-created-a-holiday-tease-20131129|archive-date=December 21, 2016}}</ref>

Myles McNutt of ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' gave the special a grade of C, criticizing it as a mere promotional vehicle for Gaga with the Muppets feeling like a last-minute addition. The production was unable to balance Gaga's album promotion with a Muppets holiday special: "Nothing in ''Lady Gaga & The Muppets' Holiday Spectacular'' destroys the sanctity of the Muppets ... However, the potential for a Muppets holiday special was never given room to materialize amidst a Lady Gaga concert special designed to sell her new album. The choice to combine the two may have reached out to a broader audience, but the incongruence of the special's various parts&nbsp;... was bound to frustrate a sizable portion of that audience."<ref name="avclub">{{Cite journal|url=http://www.avclub.com/review/lady-gaga-and-the-muppets-holiday-spectacular-106088|title=Lady Gaga And The Muppets' Holiday Spectacular|accessdate=December 14, 2016|date=November 29, 2013|first=Myles|last=McNutt|work=[[The A.V.

Rather than aim for holiday timelessness, this was self-promotion, with the Muppets often coming to Gaga's world than the other way around."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2013/nov/29/entertainment/la-et-ms-lady-gaga-and-the-muppets-created-a-holiday-tease-20131129|title=Lady Gaga and the Muppets create a holiday tease|last=Martens|first=Todd|date=November 29, 2013|accessdate=December 14, 2016|work=Los Angeles Times|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161221104150/http://articles.latimes.com/2013/nov/29/entertainment/la-et-ms-lady-gaga-and-the-muppets-created-a-holiday-tease-20131129|archive-date=December 21, 2016}}</ref> ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''{{'}}s Chris Willman also gave it a negative review, citing the show's palpably-low budget and its dialogue, guest appearances, Gaga's lip-syncing and production: "If the 90 seemingly endless minutes of ''Lady Gaga and the Muppets Holiday Spectacular'' had a predecessor, it might be the long-suppressed ''[[Star Wars Holiday Special|Star Wars Christmas Special]]'' {{sic}}, though nothing here was so outrageously wrong (or right) that people will still be bootlegging this one in 35 years' time. At least there was a familiar 'why is this happening?' question hovering over the star-crossed proceedings, albeit without the benefit of any guest stars as seriously wacky as that one's to show up and redeem the incongruousness.
