'''''Nine for IX''''' is the title for a series of documentary films which aired on [[ESPN]]. The documentaries were produced by [[ESPN Films]] in conjunction with espnW, and were intended to have the same creative, story-driven aspect as ESPN Films' other series, ''[[30 for 30]]'', with the series focusing on captivating stories of women in sports told through the lens of female filmmakers.<ref name = "Press Release"/> The series' name is inspired by [[Title IX]], federal civil rights legislation passed in 1972 that prohibited [[sex discrimination|discrimination on the basis of sex]] in educational institutions receiving federal aid; Title IX has also been regarded as helping to expand women's and girls' access to athletic opportunities. The first film, ''Venus Vs.'', premiered on July 2, 2013.
