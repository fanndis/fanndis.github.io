'''''The Blueprint 3''''' is the eleventh studio album by American rapper [[Jay-Z]], released September 8, 2009, on [[Roc Nation]], through distribution from [[Asylum Records]] & [[Atlantic Records]]. It is the third ''Blueprint'' album, preceded by ''[[The Blueprint]]'' (2001) and ''[[The Blueprint 2: The Gift & The Curse|The Blueprint<sup>2</sup>: The Gift & The Curse]]'' (2002). Production for the album took place during 2008 to 2009 at several recording studios and was handled by [[Kanye West]], [[No I.D.]], [[The Neptunes]], [[Jeff Bhasker]], [[Al Shux]], [[Jerome "J-Roc" Harmon]],  The Inkredibles, [[Swizz Beatz]], and [[Timbaland]].

The album debuted at number one on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart, selling 476,000 copies in its first week. It became Jay-Z's eleventh US number-one album, breaking the record he had previously shared with [[Elvis Presley]], and produced five singles that achieved chart success. Upon its release, ''The Blueprint 3'' received generally positive reviews from music critics.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/1265290/jay-z-and-the-beatles-dominate-album-charts |title=Jay-Z And The Beatles Dominate Album Charts |magazine=Billboard |access-date=February 2, 2014}}</ref> The album received a nomination for [[Grammy Award for Best Rap Album|Best Rap Album]], while four of its singles "[[D.O.A. (Death of Auto-Tune)]]", "[[Run This Town]]", "[[On to the Next One]]", and "[[Empire State of Mind]]" won a combined six Grammys at both the [[52nd Annual Grammy Awards]] and [[53rd Annual Grammy Awards]].

==Background==
The earliest hype over ''The Blueprint 3'' came when [[DJ Clue]] released in January 2008 a [[mixtape]] song called "Ain't I", produced by [[Timbaland]]. In the intro, Clue says, "Off that ''Blueprint 3'' baby!" However, a spokesperson for Jay-Z said that it was an old, unreleased song and that the recording of ''The Blueprint 3'' had not yet started.<ref>{{cite news | title = New Jay-Z Song Leaks -- Is Blueprint 3 In The Works? | last = Reid| first = Shaheem | publisher = MTV| url = http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1580691/20080131/jay_z.jhtml| date = January 30, 2008| access-date = July 17, 2009}}</ref> On July 20, Timbaland, a frequent contributor to previous Jay-Z albums, told [[MTV News]] that he would be producing the whole album.<ref>{{cite news | title = Timbaland On Producing Jay-Z's Next LP: 'It'll Be A Monster'| last = Reid| first = Shaheem | publisher = MTV| url = http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1590927/20080715/timbaland.jhtml| date = July 16, 2008| access-date = July 17, 2009}}</ref>  But in an interview with the ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine, Jay-Z called the statement "premature".<ref name = "Rolling Stone Interview">{{cite news| title = Jay-Z Teaming with Kanye West on Next Album| last = Van Dril| first = E.| publisher = TheCelebrityCafe| url = http://thecelebritycafe.com/features/18543.html| date = September 1, 2008| access-date = July 17, 2009| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090927013339/http://thecelebritycafe.com/features/18543.html| archive-date = September 27, 2009| url-status = dead}}</ref> In July 2009, Jay-Z confirmed ''The Blueprint 3'' as the album's title during an interview with radio station [[Shade 45]].<ref name = "GITD"/>

==Artwork==
The cover consists of a large amount of all-white instruments and recording tools stacked in a corner, with three red lines across the image. Rather than simply using photoshop, the album's design team carefully stacked all the equipment in a corner then used a projector to create the bars. They then painted red onto the equipment where the projection of the bars was, and replaced the projector with a camera to achieve the correct perspective for the image. ''Blueprint 3'' would be Jay-Z's first album cover that did not feature his face on it.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.complex.com/art-design/2013/09/best-rap-album-covers/the-blueprint-3 |title=50.

Jay-Z told ''[[Rolling Stone]]''  his method of selecting producers: "If Timbaland makes ten great tracks then he produces the album, if Kanye West makes ten great tracks then he produces the album; if he makes three, I'll take three. I let the music dictate the direction."<ref name = "Rolling Stone Interview"/>  However, the final track listing reveals, that West produced the majority of tracks on the album, and three done by Timbaland.
