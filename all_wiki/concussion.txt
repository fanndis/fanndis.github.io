==Signs and symptoms==
Concussions symptoms vary between people and include physical, cognitive, and emotional symptoms.<ref name=":0" /> Symptoms may appear immediately or be delayed.<ref name=":0" /> Up to one-third of people with concussion experience prolonged or persistent concussion symptoms, also known as [[Post-concussion syndrome|post concussion syndrome]], which is defined as concussion symptoms lasting for 4-weeks or longer in children/adolescents and symptoms lasting for more than 14 days in an adult.<ref name=":3" /><ref name="Mc2017" /> The severity of the initial symptoms is the strongest predictor of recovery time in adults.<ref name=Mc2017 />

===Physical===
[[Headache]]s are the most common mTBI symptom.<ref name=Kushner98/> Others include dizziness, vomiting, nausea, lack of [[motor coordination]], difficulty [[Balance (ability)|balancing]],<ref name=Kushner98/> or other problems with movement or sensation. Visual symptoms include [[photophobia|light sensitivity]],<ref name=Bowen03>

</ref> [[Tinnitus]], or a ringing in the ears, is also commonly reported.<ref name=Rees03/> In one in about seventy concussions, concussive [[convulsion]]s occur, but seizures that take place during or immediately after a concussion are not "[[post-traumatic seizure]]s", and, unlike post-traumatic seizures, are not predictive of [[post-traumatic epilepsy]], which requires some form of structural brain damage, not just a momentary disruption in normal brain functioning.<ref name=McCrory1998>

==Mechanism==
[[Image:Gatica1.png|thumb|Rotational force is key in a concussion. Punches in [[boxing]] can deliver more rotational force to the head than the typical impact in [[American football]].<ref name=Pellman/>]]

===Forces===
The [[human brain|brain]] is surrounded by [[cerebrospinal fluid]], which protects it from light trauma. More severe impacts, or the forces associated with rapid acceleration, may not be absorbed by this cushion.<ref name=Shaw02>

Forces may cause linear, rotational, or angular movement of the brain or a combination of them.<ref name=sivak/> In rotational movement, the head turns around its center of gravity and in angular movement, it turns on an axis, not through its center of gravity.<ref name=sivak/> The amount of rotational force is thought to be the major component in concussion<ref name=Poirier/> and its severity.<ref name=AndersonT>{{cite journal |vauthors=Anderson T, Heitger M, Macleod AD |year=2006 |url=http://www.vanderveer.org.nz/research/publications/papers/0344.pdf |title=Concussion and mild head injury |journal=[[Practical Neurology]] |volume=6 |pages=342–57 |doi=10.1136/jnnp.2006.106583 |issue=6 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070701212002/http://www.vanderveer.org.nz/research/publications/papers/0344.pdf |archive-date=2007-07-01 |citeseerx=10.1.1.536.9655 }}</ref> Studies with athletes have shown that the amount of force and the location of the impact are not necessarily correlated with the severity of the concussion or its symptoms, and have called into question the threshold for concussion previously thought to exist at around 70–75&nbsp;[[G-force|''g'']].<ref name=Guskiewicz>

The parts of the brain most affected by rotational forces are the [[midbrain]] and [[diencephalon]].<ref name=Pearce/><ref name=NEJM2007/> It is thought that the forces from the injury disrupt the normal [[cell (biology)|cell]]ular activities in the [[reticular activating system]] located in these areas and that this disruption produces the loss of consciousness often seen in concussion.<ref name=NEJM2007/> Other areas of the brain that may be affected include the upper part of the [[brain stem]], the [[fornix of brain|fornix]], the [[corpus callosum]], the [[temporal lobe]], and the [[frontal lobe]].<ref name=biglered>

</ref> As one example, in animal models, after an initial increase in glucose metabolism, there is a subsequent reduced metabolic state which may persist for up to four weeks after injury.<ref name=Peds2010/> Though these events are thought to interfere with neuronal and brain function, the [[metabolism|metabolic]] processes that follow concussion are reversible in a large majority of affected [[brain cell]]s; however, a few cells may die after the injury.<ref name=Iverson2005/>

Included in the cascade of events unleashed in the brain by concussion is impaired [[neurotransmission]], loss of regulation of [[ion]]s, deregulation of energy use and cellular metabolism, and a reduction in [[cerebral blood flow]].<ref name=Iverson2005/> Excitatory [[neurotransmitter]]s, chemicals such as [[glutamate]] that serve to stimulate nerve cells, are released in excessive amounts.<ref name=Team/> The resulting cellular excitation causes [[action potential|neurons to fire]] excessively.<ref name=GizaHovda>

</ref> This creates an imbalance of ions such as [[potassium in biology|potassium]] and [[calcium in biology|calcium]] across the cell membranes of neurons (a process like [[excitotoxicity]]).<ref name=Iverson2005/>

At the same time, cerebral blood flow is relatively reduced for unknown reasons,<ref name=Bowen03/> though the reduction in blood flow is not as severe as it is in [[ischemia]].<ref name=Iverson2005/> Thus cells get less glucose than they normally do, which causes an "energy crisis".<ref name=Bowen03/>

Concurrently with these processes, the activity of [[Mitochondrion|mitochondria]] may be reduced, which causes cells to rely on [[anaerobic metabolism]] to produce energy, increasing levels of the byproduct [[lactic acid|lactate]].<ref name=Iverson2005/>

=== Rest and return to physical and cognitive activity ===
Physical and cognitive rest is recommended for the first 24–48 hours following a concussion after which injured persons should gradually start gentle low-risk physical and cognitive activities that do not make current symptoms worse or bring on new symptoms.<ref name="Mc2017" /><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = DeMatteo C, Bednar ED, Randall S, Falla K | title = Effectiveness of return to activity and return to school protocols for children postconcussion: a systematic review | journal = BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine | volume = 6 | issue = 1 | pages = e000667 | date = February 2020 | pmid = 32153982 | pmc = 7047486 | doi = 10.1136/bmjsem-2019-000667 | url = http://bmjopensem.bmj.com/lookup/doi/10.1136/bmjsem-2019-000667 }}</ref> Any activity for which there is a risk of contact, falling, or bumping the head should be avoided.<ref name="Mc2017" /> Low-risk activities can be started even while a person has symptoms, as long as the activity does not worsen existing symptoms or bring on new concussion symptoms.<ref name=":5" /><ref name=":6" />

=== Return-to-school ===
The resumption of low-risk school activities should begin as soon as the student feels well enough. The return to school should be gradual and step-wise.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = DeMatteo C, Bednar ED, Randall S, Falla K | title = Effectiveness of return to activity and return to school protocols for children postconcussion: a systematic review | journal = BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine | volume = 6 | issue = 1 | pages = e000667 | date = 2020-02-24 | pmid = 32153982 | pmc = 7047486 | doi = 10.1136/bmjsem-2019-000667 }}</ref> Since students may appear 'normal', continuing education of relevant school personnel may be needed.<ref name="Peds2010" />{{Needs update|date=July 2020|reason=}}

=== Return-to-sport ===
For persons participating in athletics, the 2016 Berlin Consensus Statement on Concussion in Sport recommends that participants progress through a series of graded steps after an initial 24-48h of relative physical and cognitive rest.<ref name="Mc2017" /> These steps include:
* Symptom-limited activity
* Light aerobic activity such as walking or stationary cycling
* Sport-specific activities such as running drills and skating drills
* Non-contact training drills (exercise, coordination, and cognitive load)
* Full-contact practice
* Return to sport (requires medical clearance)

Each step should last at least 24 hours before progression to the next. If symptoms worsen, athletes should drop back to the previous asymptomatic level for at least another 24 hours.<ref name="Mc2017" /> Athletes, especially intercollegiate or [[Professional sports|professional]], are typically followed closely by team athletic trainers during this period but others may not have access to this level of health care and may be sent home with minimal monitoring.

==History==
[[Image:HippocraticOath.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Hippocratic Corpus]] mentioned concussion.<ref name=Masferrer/>]]
The Hippocratic Corpus, a collection of medical works from ancient Greece, mentions concussion, later translated to ''commotio cerebri'', and discusses loss of speech, hearing and sight that can result from "commotion of the brain".<ref name=Masferrer>{{Cite journal|vauthors=Masferrer R, Masferrer M, Prendergast V, Harrington TR |year=2000 |url=http://www.thebarrow.org/Education_And_Resources/Barrow_Quarterly/205077 |title=Grading scale for cerebral concussions |journal=BNI Quarterly |volume=16 |issue=1 |issn=0894-5799}}</ref> This idea of disruption of mental function by "shaking of the brain" remained the widely accepted understanding of concussion until the 19th&nbsp;century.<ref name=Masferrer/> In the 10th&nbsp;century, the Persian physician [[Muhammad ibn Zakarīya Rāzi]] was the first to write about concussion as distinct from other types of head injury.<ref name=McCrory>{{cite journal | vauthors = McCrory PR, Berkovic SF | title = Concussion: the history of clinical and pathophysiological concepts and misconceptions | journal = Neurology | volume = 57 | issue = 12 | pages = 2283–9 | date = December 2001 | pmid = 11756611 | doi = 10.1212/WNL.57.12.2283 }}</ref> He may have been the first to use the term "cerebral concussion", and his definition of the condition, a transient loss of function with no physical damage, set the stage for the medical understanding of the condition for centuries.<ref name=sivak>{{cite journal | vauthors = Sivák S, Kurca E, Jancovic D, Petriscák S, Kucera P | title = [Contemporary view on mild brain injuries in adult population] | language = sk | journal = Casopis Lekaru Ceskych | volume = 144 | issue = 7 | pages = 445–50; discussion 451–4 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16161536 | url = http://www.clsjep.cz/odkazy/clc0507_445.pdf | url-status = dead | trans-title = An outline of the current concepts of mild brain injury with emphasis on the adult population | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080227161612/http://www.clsjep.cz/odkazy/clc0507_445.pdf | archive-date = 2008-02-27 }}</ref>

In the 13th&nbsp;century, the physician [[Lanfranc of Milan]]'s ''Chiurgia Magna'' described concussion as brain "commotion", also recognizing a difference between concussion and other types of traumatic brain injury (though many of his contemporaries did not), and discussing the transience of post-concussion symptoms as a result of temporary loss of function from the injury.<ref name=McCrory/> In the 14th&nbsp;century, the surgeon [[Guy de Chauliac]] pointed out the relatively good prognosis of concussion as compared to more severe types of head trauma such as [[skull fracture]]s and [[penetrating head trauma]].<ref name=McCrory/> In the 16th-century, the term "concussion" came into use, and symptoms such as confusion, lethargy, and memory problems were described.<ref name=McCrory/> The 16th&nbsp;century physician [[Ambroise Paré]] used the term ''commotio cerebri'',<ref name=sivak/> as well as "shaking of the brain", "commotion", and "concussion".<ref name=Masferrer/>
[[Image:Guillaume Dupuytren.jpg|thumb|lef|upright|[[Guillaume Dupuytren]] distinguished between concussion and unconsciousness associated with [[brain contusion]].<ref name=Masferrer/>]]

Until the 17th&nbsp;century, a concussion was usually described by its clinical features, but after the invention of the microscope, more physicians began exploring underlying physical and structural mechanisms.<ref name=McCrory/> However, the prevailing view in the 17th century was that the injury did not result from physical damage, and this view continued to be widely held throughout the 18th&nbsp;century.<ref name=McCrory/> The word "concussion" was used at the time to describe the state of unconsciousness and other functional problems that resulted from the impact, rather than a physiological condition.<ref name=McCrory/> In 1839, Guillaume Dupuytren described brain contusions, which involve many small hemorrhages, as ''contusio cerebri'' and showed the difference between unconsciousness associated with damage to the brain [[parenchyma]] and that due to concussion, without such injury.<ref name=Masferrer/> In 1941, animal experiments showed that no [[macroscopic]] damage occurs in concussion.<ref name=Masferrer/><ref name="Denny-Brown">{{cite journal | vauthors = Denny-Brown D, Russell WR | title = Experimental cerebral concussion | journal = The Journal of Physiology | volume = 99 | issue = 1 | pages = 153 | date = December 1940 | pmid = 16995229 | pmc = 1394062 | doi = 10.1113/jphysiol.1940.sp003887 | url = http://www.jphysiol.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=16995229 }}</ref>

===Costs===
Due to the lack of a consistent definition, the economic costs of mTBI are not known, but they are estimated to be very high.<ref name=BorgWHO>{{cite journal | vauthors = Borg J, Holm L, Peloso PM, Cassidy JD, Carroll LJ, von Holst H, Paniak C, Yates D | display-authors = 6 | title = Non-surgical intervention and cost for mild traumatic brain injury: results of the WHO Collaborating Centre Task Force on Mild Traumatic Brain Injury | journal = Journal of Rehabilitation Medicine | volume = 36 | issue = 43 Suppl | pages = 76–83 | date = February 2004 | pmid = 15083872 | doi = 10.1080/16501960410023840 | doi-access = free }}</ref> These high costs are due in part to the large percentage of hospital admissions for head injury that is due to mild head trauma,<ref name="LevinHS"/> but indirect costs such as lost work time and early retirement account for the bulk of the costs.<ref name=BorgWHO/> These direct and indirect costs cause the expense of mild brain trauma to rival that of moderate and severe head injuries.<ref name=Silver05>{{Cite book|vauthors=Kraus JF, Chu LD |chapter=Epidemiology |veditors=Silver JM, McAllister TW, Yudofsky SC |year=2005 | title=Textbook of Traumatic Brain Injury |publisher=American Psychiatric Pub., Inc |isbn=978-1-58562-105-7 |page=23}}</ref>

===Terminology===
The terms mild brain injury, mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), mild head injury (MHI), and concussion may be used interchangeably;<ref name=ncipc>{{Cite web |author=National Center for Injury Prevention and Control |year=2003 |url=https://www.cdc.gov/ncipc/pub-res/mtbi/mtbireport.pdf |title=Report to congress on mild traumatic brain injury in the United States: Steps to prevent a serious public health problem |location=Atlanta, GA |publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |access-date=2008-01-19 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080228143923/http://www.cdc.gov/ncipc/pub-res/mtbi/mtbireport.pdf |archive-date=2008-02-28 }}</ref><ref name=Petchprapai07/> although the term "concussion" is still used in sports literature as interchangeable with "MHI" or "mTBI", the general clinical medical literature uses "mTBI" instead, since a 2003 [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]] report outlined it as an important strategy.<ref name="BarthVarney99"/><ref name=sivak/> In this article, "concussion" and "mTBI" are used interchangeably.

The term "concussion" is from [[Latin]] ''concutere'', "to shake violently"<ref name=Pearce>{{cite journal | vauthors = Pearce JM | title = Observations on concussion. A review | journal = European Neurology | volume = 59 | issue = 3-4 | pages = 113–9 | year = 2007 | pmid = 18057896 | doi = 10.1159/000111872 | url = https://www.karger.com/Article/Pdf/111872 | doi-access = free }}</ref> or ''concussus'', "action of striking together".<ref name=Brooks>{{Cite journal|vauthors=Brooks D, Hunt B |title=Current concepts in concussion diagnosis and management in sports: A clinical review|journal=BC Medical Journal  |volume=48 |issue= 9 |pages=453–59 |year=2006  |url=http://www.bcmj.org/node/851}}</ref>

Measurement of predictive visual tracking is being studied as a screening technique to identify mild traumatic brain injury. A [[head-mounted display]] unit with [[Eye tracking|eye-tracking]] capability shows a moving object in a predictive pattern for the person to follow with their eyes. People without brain injury will be able to track the moving object with [[smooth pursuit eye movements]] and correct [[trajectory]] while it is hypothesized that those with mild traumatic brain injury cannot.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Maruta J, Lee SW, Jacobs EF, Ghajar J | title = A unified science of concussion | journal = Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences | volume = 1208 | issue = 1 | pages = 58–66 | date = October 2010 | pmid = 20955326 | pmc = 3021720 | doi = 10.1111/j.1749-6632.2010.05695.x | bibcode = 2010NYASA1208...58M }}</ref>

=== Grading systems ===
{{Main|Concussion grading systems}}
At least 41 systems measure the severity, or grade, of a mild head injury,<ref name="AndersonT" /> and there is little agreement about which is best.<ref name="cantu01" /> In an effort to simplify, the 2nd International Conference on Concussion in Sport, meeting in Prague in 2004, decided that these systems should be abandoned in favor of a 'simple' or 'complex' classification.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = McCrory P, Johnston K, Meeuwisse W, Aubry M, Cantu R, Dvorak J, Graf-Baumann T, Kelly J, Lovell M, Schamasch P | display-authors = 6 | title = Summary and agreement statement of the 2nd International Conference on Concussion in Sport, Prague 2004 | journal = British Journal of Sports Medicine | volume = 39 | issue = 4 | pages = 196–204 | date = April 2005 | pmid = 15793085 | pmc = 1725173 | doi = 10.1136/bjsm.2005.018614 }}</ref> However, the 2008 meeting in Zurich abandoned the simple versus complex terminology, although the participants did agree to keep the concept that most (80–90%) concussions resolve in a short period (7–10 days) and although the recovery time frame may be longer in children and adolescents.<ref name="2008 Consensus Statement" />{{Update inline|date=November 2019|reason=}}

In the past, the decision to allow athletes to return to participation was frequently based on the grade of concussion.{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}} However, current research and recommendations by professional organizations including the [[National Athletic Trainers' Association]] recommend against such use of these grading systems.{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}} Currently, injured athletes are prohibited from returning to play before they are symptom-free during both rest and exertion and until results of the [[neuropsychological test]]s have returned to pre-injury levels.{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}}

Three grading systems have been most widely followed: by Robert Cantu, the [[Colorado Medical Society]], and the [[American Academy of Neurology]].<ref name="cobb" /> Each employs three grades, as summarized in the following table:<ref name="cantu01" />
