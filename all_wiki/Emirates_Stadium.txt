The '''Emirates Stadium''' (known as '''Ashburton Grove''' prior to sponsorship, and as '''Arsenal Stadium''' for [[UEFA]] competitions) is a [[association football|football]] stadium in [[Highbury]], England, and the home of [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]].<ref name="Arsenal Postal Address">{{Cite web|title=Arsenal Postal Address|url=https://www.arsenal.com/the-club/contact-arsenal|access-date=28 August 2020|website=www.arsenal.com|language=en}}</ref><ref name="Arsenal Box Office">{{Cite web|date=1 June 2017|title=Contact the Box Office|url=https://www.arsenal.com/tickets/contact-the-box-office|access-date=28 August 2020|website=www.arsenal.com|language=en}}</ref><ref name="Premier League Info">{{Cite web|title=Emirates Stadium Arsenal FC - Stadium Information {{!}} Premier League|url=https://www.premierleague.com/clubs/1/Arsenal/stadium|access-date=28 August 2020|website=www.premierleague.com|language=en}}</ref><ref name="Arsenal Neighbourhood">{{Cite web|title=Arsenal Neighbourhood|url=https://www.192.com/places/n/n5-1/n5-1bu/|access-date=28 August 2020|website=192.com}}</ref><ref name="Event Management">{{Cite web|title=Emirates Stadium, London - Yell|url=https://www.yell.com/biz/emirates-stadium-london-6524501/|access-date=28 August 2020|website=www.yell.com|language=en-GB}}</ref> With a capacity of 60,704 it is the [[List of football stadiums in England|fourth-largest football stadium in England]] after [[Wembley Stadium]], [[Old Trafford]] and [[Tottenham Hotspur Stadium]].

In 1997, Arsenal explored the possibility of relocating to a new stadium, having been denied planning permission by [[Islington Council]] to expand its home stadium, [[Arsenal Stadium|Highbury]]. After considering various options (including purchasing Wembley Stadium), the club bought an industrial and waste disposal estate in Ashburton Grove in 2000. A year later, they received the council's approval to build a stadium on the site; manager [[Arsène Wenger]] described this as the "biggest decision in Arsenal's history" since the board appointed [[Herbert Chapman]].{{sfn|Spurling|p=85}} Relocation began in 2002, but financial difficulties delayed work until February 2004. [[Emirates (airline)|Emirates]] was later announced as the main sponsor for the stadium. The entire stadium project was completed in 2006 at a cost of £390&nbsp;million.<ref name="FAQs"/> The club's former stadium was redeveloped as [[Highbury Square]], an apartment complex.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Media Group|first1=Arsenal|title=Arsenal celebrates Highbury Square opening|url=http://www.arsenal.com/news/news-archive/arsenal-celebrates-highbury-square-opening|website=www.arsenal.com|publisher=The Arsenal Football Club plc|accessdate=7 July 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160707123358/http://www.arsenal.com/news/news-archive/arsenal-celebrates-highbury-square-opening|archive-date=7 July 2016|date=24 September 2009}}</ref>

The stadium has undergone a process of "Arsenalisation" since 2009 with the aim of restoring visible links to Arsenal's history. The stadium has hosted international fixtures and music concerts.

==History==
===Background===
[[File:Wembley Twin Towers - geograph.org.uk - 258671.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]] was one of the sites Arsenal considered relocating to.|alt=A white tower facing parallel to an identical tower.]]

Spectator safety at football grounds was a major concern during the 1980s, following incidents of [[Football hooliganism in the United Kingdom|hooliganism]], and disasters such as the [[Bradford City stadium fire]] and the [[Heysel Stadium disaster]] in 1985, and the [[Hillsborough disaster]] in 1989. The [[Taylor Report]] into the Hillsborough tragedy was finalised in January 1990 and recommended the removal of terraces (standing areas) in favour of seating.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/sport/football/other-clubs/hillsborough_how_taylor_ensured_there_would_never_be_a_repeat_1_2342256 | title=Hillsborough: How Taylor ensured there would never be a repeat |newspaper=Yorkshire Post |location=Leeds |date=13 April 2009 |accessdate=17 February 2012}}</ref>

Under the amended [[Football Spectators Act 1989]], it became compulsory for first and second tier English clubs to have their stadia all-seated in time for the [[1994–95 in English football|1994–95]] season.<ref>{{cite web |first1=John |last1=Woodhouse |first2=Jack |last2=Dent |url=http://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/SN03937/SN03937.pdf | title=Standing at football matches |publisher=Parliament of the United Kingdom |date=9 June 2017 |accessdate=18 October 2017}}</ref> [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], like many other clubs, experienced difficulty raising income for converted terraced areas.{{sfn|Brown|p=54}} At the end of the [[1990–91 Arsenal F.C. season|1990–91]] season, the club introduced a bond scheme which offered supporters the right to purchase a season ticket at its renovated North Bank stand of [[Arsenal Stadium|Highbury]].{{sfn|Brown|p=54}} The board felt this was the only viable option after considering other proposals; they did not want to compromise on traditions nor curb manager [[George Graham (footballer, born 1944)|George Graham]]'s transfer dealings.<ref>{{cite news |title=Bonds issue will fund Arsenal's £20m upgrading |first=Jonathan |last=Prynn |page=40 |newspaper=The Times |location=London |date=11 May 1991}}</ref> At a price of between [[Pound sterling|£]]1,000 to £1,500, the 150-year bond was criticised by supporters, who argued it potentially blocked the participation of those less well-off from supporting Arsenal.{{sfn|Brown|p=55}} A campaign directed by the Independent Arsenal Supporters' Association brought relative success as only a third of all bonds were sold.{{sfn|Brown|p=57}}

The North Bank was the final stand to be refurbished. It opened in August 1993 at a cost of £20&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/news/architecture-a-grand-stand-for-football-at-arsenal-new-safety-standards-and-innovative-design-are-being-used-to-turn-the-game-into-family-entertainment-callum-murray-applauds-1460432.html | title=A grand stand for football |newspaper=The Independent |location=London |last=Murray |first=Callum |date=11 August 1993 |accessdate=17 February 2012}}</ref> The rework significantly reduced the stadium's capacity, from 57,000 at the beginning of the decade to under 40,000.{{sfn|Glinert|p=105}} High ticket prices to serve the club's existing debts and low attendance figures forced Arsenal to explore the possibility of building a larger stadium in 1997. The club wanted to attract an evergrowing fanbase and financially compete with the biggest clubs in England.{{sfn|Glinert|p=105}}<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/arsenal-consider-leaving-hallowed-marble-halls-1246012.html |title=Arsenal consider leaving hallowed marble halls |newspaper=The Independent |location=London |last=Garner |first=Clare |date=18 August 1997 |accessdate=4 March 2012}}</ref> By comparison, [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] enjoyed a rise in gate receipts; the club went from £43.9&nbsp;million in 1994 to £87.9&nbsp;million in 1997  because of [[Old Trafford]]'s expansion.{{sfn|Bernstein|p=214}}

Arsenal's initial proposal to rebuild Highbury was met with disapproval from local residents, as it required the demolition of 25 neighbouring houses.{{sfn|Conn|p=66}} It later became problematic once the East Stand of the stadium was granted [[Listed building (United Kingdom)#Examples of Grade II listed buildings|Grade II]] listing in July 1997.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/arsenals-marble-halls-are-saved-for-posterity-1251179.html |title=Arsenal's marble halls are saved for posterity |newspaper=The Independent |location=London |last=Jury |first=Louise |date=18 July 1997 |accessdate=18 February 2012}}</ref> After much consultation, the club abandoned its plan, deciding a capacity of 48,000 was not large enough.{{sfn|Conn|p=67}} Arsenal then investigated the possibility of relocating to [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]] and in March 1998 made an official bid to purchase the ground.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sport/football/48799.stm |title=Gunners aim for the twin towers |publisher=BBC News |date=19 January 1998 |accessdate=18 February 2012}}</ref><ref name="wembid">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sport/football/64881.stm | title=Arsenal offer to buy Wembley |publisher=BBC News |date=12 March 1998 |accessdate=18 February 2012}}</ref> [[The Football Association]] (FA) and the English National Stadium Trust opposed Arsenal's offer, claiming it harmed England's bid for the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]], which [[FIFA]] itself denied.<ref name="wembid"/> In April 1998, Arsenal withdrew its bid and Wembley was purchased by the English National Stadium Trust.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sport/73086.stm |title=Wembley Stadium sold to highest bidder |publisher=BBC News |date=2 April 1998 |accessdate=18 October 2017}}</ref> The club however was given permission to host its [[UEFA Champions League]] home ties at Wembley for the [[1998–99 UEFA Champions League|1998–99]] and [[1999–2000 UEFA Champions League|1999–2000]] seasons.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sport/football/138932.stm |title=Arsenal get Wembley go-ahead  |publisher=BBC News |date=24 July 1998 |accessdate=18 October 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Arsenal home on new test |first=Russell |last=Kempson |page=62 |newspaper=The Times |date=25 November 1999}}</ref> Although Arsenal's time in the competition was brief, twice exiting the group stages, the club set its record home attendance (73,707 against [[RC Lens|Lens]]) and earned record gate income in the 1998–99 season, highlighting potential profitability.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-gunners-cash-in-at-the-gate-1180077.html |title=Gunners cash in at the gate |newspaper=The Independent |location=London |date=22 October 1998 |accessdate=18 October 2017}}</ref>

===Site selection and development proposals===
In November 1999, Arsenal examined the feasibility of building a new stadium in Ashburton Grove.{{sfn|Conn|p=67}} Anthony Spencer, estate agent and club property adviser, recommended the area to director [[Danny Fiszman]] and vice-chairman [[David Dein]] having scoured over North London for potential areas.{{sfn|Conn|p=67}}<ref name="landw">{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2000/nov/12/theobserver.observerbusiness5 | title=Rocky road to new Wembley | newspaper=The Observer |first=Denis |last=Campbell |first2=Nick |last2=Mathiason |location=London | date=12 November 2000 | accessdate=19 February 2012 }}</ref> The land, {{convert|450|m|yds}} from Highbury was composed of a rubbish processing plant and industrial estate, 80% owned to varying levels by [[Islington London Borough Council|Islington Council]], [[Railtrack]] and [[Sainsbury's]].<ref name="landw"/> After passing the first significant milestone at Islington Council's planning committee, Arsenal submitted a planning application for a new-build 60,000 seater stadium in November 2000.{{sfn|Conn|p=67}}{{sfn|Spurling|p=86}} This included a redevelopment project at Drayton Park, converting the existing ground Highbury to flats and building a new waste station in Lough Road.{{sfn|Conn|p=67}} As part of the scheme, Arsenal intended to create 1,800 new jobs for the community and 2,300 new homes.{{sfn|Glinert|p=106}}<ref name="Evening">{{cite news|url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/sport/article-1003087-winners-and-losers-in-400m-plan.do |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130505073959/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/sport/article-1003087-winners-and-losers-in-400m-plan.do |url-status=dead |archive-date=5 May 2013 |title=Winners and losers in £400m plan |newspaper=London Evening Standard |date=11 December 2001 |accessdate=19 February 2012 }}</ref> Improvements to three railway stations, [[Holloway Road tube station|Holloway Road]], [[Drayton Park railway station|Drayton Park]] and [[Finsbury Park station|Finsbury Park]], were included to cope with the increased capacity requirements from matchday crowds.<ref name="Evening"/>

Islington Stadium Communities Alliance (ISCA) – an alliance of 16 groups representing local residents and businesses, was set up in January 2000 as a body against the redevelopment.<ref>{{cite news |title=Residents' opposition group call for public inquiry |first=David |last=Bond |page=91 |newspaper=London Evening Standard |date=7 November 2000}}</ref> Alison Carmichael, a spokeswoman for the group, said of the move, "It may look like Arsenal are doing great things for the area, but in its detail the plan is awful. We blame the council; the football club just wants to expand to make more money."{{sfn|Conn|p=68}} Tom Lamb, an ISCA member, was concerned about as air pollution and growing traffic, adding "that is a consequence which most Arsenal fans would never see, because they are in Islington only for about thirty days a year."{{sfn|Spurling|p=86}}

Seven months after the planning application was submitted, a poll showed that 75% of respondents (2,133 residents) were against the scheme.{{sfn|Conn|p=68}} By October 2001, the club asserted that a poll of Islington residents found that 70% were in favour,<ref>{{cite news |last=Wallace |first=Sam |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/arsenal/3014070/Pressure-group-threaten-public-inquiry-into-Arsenal-proposals-for-new-stadium.html |title=Pressure group threaten public inquiry into Arsenal proposals for new stadium |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date=4 October 2001 |accessdate=21 February 2012}}</ref> and received the backing from the then [[Mayor of London]], [[Ken Livingstone]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/1595565.stm |title=Mayor backs Arsenal plan |publisher=BBC Sport |date=12 October 2001 |accessdate=8 August 2014}}</ref> The club launched a campaign to aid the project in the run up to Christmas and planted the slogan

===Finance and naming===
Securing finance for the stadium project proved a challenge as Arsenal received no [[Subsidy|public subsidy]] from the government. Whereas Wenger claimed French clubs "pay nothing at all for their stadium, nothing at all for their maintenance," and "[[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]] paid one euro for [[Allianz Arena|their ground]]," Arsenal were required to buy the site outright in one of London's most expensive areas.<ref>{{cite news |first=Nick |last=Ames | url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/feb/12/arsene-wenger-arsenal-fans-boycott-leicester |title=Arsène Wenger advises Arsenal and Leicester fans to drop boycott |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London | date=12 February 2016 | accessdate=19 October 2017}}</ref><ref name="benge">{{cite news |first=James |last=Benge | url=https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/arsene-wenger-arsenals-move-to-the-emirates-stadium-was-the-most-difficult-period-in-my-life-a3549976.html |title=Arsene Wenger: Arsenal's move to the Emirates Stadium was the most difficult period in my life |newspaper=London Evening Standard | date=26 May 2017 | accessdate=19 October 2017 |quote=At the time it was £4,000 a seat.

==Structure and facilities==
[[File:Emirates Stadium, Highbury and its surrounds from the air.jpg|thumb|left|An aerial view of the Emirates Stadium and surrounding area. Arsenal's former stadium Highbury, which has since been redeveloped into [[Highbury Square]] is visible.]]
Described as "beautiful" and "intimidating" by architect Christopher Lee of Populous,<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/fans-wont-be-priced-out-of-emirates-stadium-7245244.html |title=Fans won't be priced out of Emirates Stadium |first=Stuart |last=James |newspaper=London Evening Standard |date=15 December 2004 |accessdate=11 March 2013}}</ref> the Emirates Stadium is a four-tiered bowl with translucent polycarbonate roofing over the stands, but not over the pitch.<ref name=structure>{{cite web |title=Emirates Stadium |url=http://www.designbuild-network.com/projects/ashburton/ |publisher=Design Build Network |accessdate=10 March 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100405072853/http://www.designbuild-network.com/projects/ashburton/ |archive-date=5 April 2010 |df=dmy }}</ref> The underside is clad with metallic panels and the roof is supported by four triangular trusses, made of welded tubular steel.<ref name=structure /> Two trusses span {{convert|200|m}} in a north–south direction while a further two span an east–west direction.<ref name=structure /> The trusses are supported by the stadium's vertical concrete cores, eight of which connected to them by steel tripods. They in turn each house four stairways, a passenger lift as well as service access.<ref name=structure /> [[Façade]]s are either glazed or woven between the cores which allows visitors on the podium to see inside the stadium.<ref name=structure /> The glass and steel construction was devised by [[Populous (company)|Populous]] to give an impression that the stadium sparkles in sunlight and glows in the night.<ref name=structure />

The upper and lower parts of the stadium feature standard seating. The stadium has two levels below ground that house its support facilities such as commercial kitchens, changing rooms and press and education centres.<ref name=structure /> The main middle tier, known as the "[[Club seating|Club Level]]", is premium priced and also includes the director's box. There are 7,139 seats at this level, which are sold on licences lasting from one to four years. Immediately above the club tier there is a small circle consisting of 150 boxes of 10, 12 and 15 seats. The total number of spectators at this level is 2,222. The high demand for tickets, as well as the relative wealth of their London fans, means revenue from [[club seating|premium seating]] and [[luxury suite|corporate boxes]] is nearly as high as the revenue from the entire stadium at Highbury.<ref>Based on a quote by chief executive [[Keith Edelman]] in ''Management Today'', quoted in: {{cite web | url=http://www.arsenalnewsreview.co.uk/reasons-to-be-cheerf/ | title=Reasons to be cheerful | work=Arsenal News Review | date=6 August 2004 | accessdate=8 December 2006}}</ref>

[[File:Emirates Stadium - canons.jpg|thumb|right|Cannons positioned outside the stadium.]]

The upper tier is contoured to leave open space in the corners of the ground, and the roof is significantly canted inwards. Both of these features are meant to provide as much airflow and sunlight to the pitch as possible.<ref name=key_facts/> Supporters in the upper tier on one side of the ground are unable to see supporters in the upper tier opposite.<ref name=structure /> As part of a deal with [[Sony]], the stadium was the first in the world to incorporate [[HDTV]] streaming.<ref>{{cite web|title=Sony helps Arsenal to entertain football fans|url=http://www.sony.co.uk/biz/content/id/1193315645513/section/press-release-press-case-studies|publisher=Sony|accessdate=10 March 2012}}</ref> In the north-west and south-east corners of the stadium are two giant screens suspended from the roof.

The pitch is {{convert|105|by|68|m|yd}} in size and the total grass area at Emirates is {{convert|113|by|76|m|yd}}.<ref name="key_facts">{{cite news| url=http://www.arsenal.com/assets/_files/documents/oct_09/gun__1255358919_012-015.emirates.pdf| title=Emirates Stadium Facts |publisher=Arsenal F.C.| date=October 2009 |accessdate=20 October 2017 | url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121013232936/http://www.arsenal.com/assets/_files/documents/oct_09/gun__1255358919_012-015.emirates.pdf| archive-date=13 October 2012| df=dmy-all}}</ref> Like Highbury, it runs north–south, with the players' tunnel and the dugouts on the west side of the pitch underneath the main TV camera. The away fans are found in the south-east corner of the lower tier. The away supporter configuration can be expanded from 1,500 seats to 4,500 seats behind the south goal in the lower tier, and a further 4,500 seats can be made available also in the upper tier, bringing the total to 9,000 supporters (the regulation 15% required for domestic cup competitions such as the [[FA Cup]] and [[EFL Cup]]).<ref>{{cite news

In September 2017, Arsenal opened a [[sensory room]] at the stadium for the fans.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.arsenal.com/news/arsenal-sensory-room-opens-its-doors |title=The Arsenal sensory room opens its doors |date=14 September 2017 |work=Arsenal.com |access-date=19 March 2020}}</ref> There is 241 wheelchair accessible seats within the Emirates Stadium.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.arsenal.com/community/arsenal-for-everyone/facilities-at-emirates-stadium |title=Facilities at Emirates Stadium |date=31 May 2017 |website=Arsenal.com |access-date=19 March 2020}}</ref>

The Emirates Stadium pays tribute to Arsenal's former home, Highbury. The club's offices are officially called Highbury House, located north-east of Emirates Stadium, and house the bust of [[Herbert Chapman]] that used to reside at Highbury. Three other busts that used to reside at Highbury of [[Claude Ferrier]] (architect of Highbury's East stand), [[Denis Hill-Wood]] (former Arsenal chairman) and manager Arsène Wenger have also been moved to Emirates Stadium and are in display in the entrance of the Diamond Club.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arsenal.com/news/news-archive/commenorative-busts-unveiled-pictures|title=Commemorative busts unveiled – Pictures|publisher=Arsenal F.C|date=18 October 2007|accessdate=10 January 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121012221345/http://www.arsenal.com/news/news-archive/commenorative-busts-unveiled-pictures|archive-date=12 October 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Additionally, the clock that gave its name to the old Clock End has been resited on the new clock end which features a newer, larger replica of the clock. The Arsenal club museum, which was formerly held in the North Bank Stand, opened in October 2006 and is located to the north of the stadium, within the Northern Triangle building. It houses the marble statues that were once held in the marble halls of Highbury.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arsenal.com/history/the-arsenal-museum |title=The Arsenal Museum |publisher=Arsenal F.C |accessdate=10 January 2011}}</ref>

==Transport and access==
[[File:Ashburton Grove.svg|thumb|left|A map of the Emirates Stadium and surrounding connections]]
The Emirates Stadium is served by a number of [[London Underground]] stations and bus routes. [[Arsenal tube station|Arsenal station]] is the closest for the northern portion of the stadium accessed via the Ken Friar bridge, with [[Highbury & Islington station]] servicing the southern end.<ref name="get">{{cite news| url=http://www.arsenal.com/emirates-stadium/get-to...-emirates-stadium | title=Get to... Emirates Stadium |accessdate=23 February 2012 |publisher=Arsenal F.C.}}</ref> While [[Holloway Road tube station|Holloway Road station]] is the closest to the southern portion, it is entry-only before matches and exit-only afterwards to prevent overcrowding. [[Drayton Park railway station|Drayton Park station]], adjacent to the Danny fiszman Bridge is shut on matchdays as the rail services to this station do not operate at weekends nor after 10&nbsp;pm.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.nationalrail.co.uk/stations/dyp/details.html| title=Drayton Park (DYP) | work=National Rail |accessdate=23 February 2012 }}</ref> £7.6 million was set aside in the planning permission for upgrading Drayton Park and Holloway Road; however [[Transport for London]] decided not to upgrade either station, in favour of improvement works at the interchanges at Highbury & Islington and [[Finsbury Park station|Finsbury Park]] stations, both of which are served by Underground and National Rail services and are approximately a ten-minute walk away. The Emirates Stadium is the only football stadium that stands beside the East Coast Main Line between London and Edinburgh and is just over 2 miles from London King's Cross.<ref name="guardiantube">{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2006/may/03/sport.comment1 | title=Shadow of Arsenal's grand design hangs over the little people |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London | date=3 May 2006 | accessdate=26 March 2010 | first=David | last=Conn}}</ref>

Driving to the Emirates Stadium is strongly discouraged as there are strict matchday parking restrictions in operation around the stadium.<ref name="get"/> An hour before kick-off to one hour after the final whistle there is a complete ban on vehicle movement on a number of the surrounding roads, except for Islington residents and businesses with a road closure access permit.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.islington.gov.uk/Leisure/arsenal_new/transportinfo/roadclosures1.asp |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101216065613/http://www.islington.gov.uk/Leisure/arsenal_new/transportinfo/roadclosures1.asp |title=Road Closures and Traffic |work=Islington Council |date=23 December 2009 | archive-date=16 December 2010 |accessdate=12 May 2013}}</ref> The parking restrictions mean that the stadium is highly dependent on the Underground service, particularly when there is no overground service in operation.<ref name = "wolves postponement">{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/16300935 |title=Arsenal put Wolves match back 24 hours |date=22 December 2011 |accessdate=19 December 2012 |publisher=BBC Sport }}</ref> Industrial action forced Arsenal to reschedule the match for the following month.<ref name = "wolves postponement"/>

Non-members are issued with one-off paper tickets embedded with an [[Radio-frequency identification|RFID]] tag allowing them to enter the stadium.
