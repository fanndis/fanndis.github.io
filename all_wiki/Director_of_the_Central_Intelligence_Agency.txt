The '''Director of the Central Intelligence Agency''' ('''D/CIA''') is a statutory office ({{UnitedStatesCode|50|3036}}) that functions as the head of the [[Central Intelligence Agency]], which in turn is a part of the [[United States Intelligence Community]]. Since February 2017, the D/CIA has been a member of the [[Cabinet of the United States]], as designated by the President of the United States. 

The Director reports to the [[Director of National Intelligence]] (DNI) and is assisted by the [[Deputy Director of the Central Intelligence Agency]]. The Director is a civilian or a [[General officer|General]]/[[Flag Officer]] of the [[United States armed forces|Armed Forces]]<ref>{{UnitedStatesCode|10|528}} Officers serving in certain intelligence positions: military status; exclusion from distribution and strength limitations; pay and allowances</ref> nominated by the [[President of the United States]], with the recommendation from the DNI,<ref>{{UnitedStatesCode|50|403-6}} Appointment of officials responsible for intelligence-related activities</ref> and must be confirmed by a majority vote of the [[United States Senate]].<ref>{{UnitedStatesCode|50|3036}} Director of the Central Intelligence Agency</ref>

==History==
{{further|Director of National Intelligence}}
Before April 21, 2005, the [[director of Central Intelligence]] (DCI) headed both the [[United States Intelligence Community|Intelligence Community]] and the Central Intelligence Agency. In addition, DCI served as an advisor to the [[president of the United States]] on intelligence matters and was the statutory intelligence advisor to the [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]] (NSC). On April 21, 2005, the director of national intelligence (DNI) took on the roles as head of the Intelligence Community and principal intelligence advisor to the president and the NSC.

The post of DCI was established in 1946 by [[President of the United States|President]] [[Harry S. Truman]];<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/news-information/featured-story-archive/2008-featured-story-archive/national-security-act-of-1947.html |title=A Look Back … The National Security Act of 1947 — Central Intelligence Agency|website=www.cia.gov|language=en|access-date=February 6, 2017}}</ref> it thus predates the establishment of the Central Intelligence Agency (created by the [[National Security Act of 1947]]). After the end of [[World War II]], the [[Office of Strategic Services]] was dismantled and its functions were split between the departments of state and war (now defense).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/history/united-states-and-canada/us-history/office-strategic-services|title=Office of Strategic Services facts, information, pictures {{!}} Encyclopedia.com articles about Office of Strategic Services|website=www.encyclopedia.com|language=en|access-date=February 6, 2017}}</ref>  President Truman soon recognized the inefficiency of this arrangement and created the [[Central Intelligence Group]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/GPO-INTELLIGENCE/html/int009.html|title=The Organizational Arrangements for the Intelligence Community|website=www.gpo.gov|access-date=February 6, 2017}}</ref> which could be considered a smaller precursor to the National Security Council.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/truman-signs-the-national-security-act|title=Truman signs the National Security Act - Jul 26, 1947 - HISTORY.com|newspaper=HISTORY.com|access-date=February 6, 2017}}</ref>  The following year the [[National Security Act of 1947]] created the Central Intelligence Agency and National Security Council, while formally defining the duties of the director of Central Intelligence.  The duties of the DCI had been further defined over the years by tradition, congressional acts, and [[Executive order (United States)|Executive Order]]s.

==Order of succession==
The order of succession determines which official shall act and perform the functions and duties of the director in the event he or she dies, resigns, or otherwise becomes unable to perform their duties. The official will serve as Acting Director.

If the official is already serving in an acting capacity, or he or she is otherwise not eligible under the [[Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998]], the order skips to the next person in line. However, the [[president of the United States]] retains discretion to depart from the list in designating an acting director.<ref>https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/memorandum-providing-order-succession-within-central-intelligence-agency/</ref>
