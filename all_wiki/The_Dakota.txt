'''The Dakota''', also known as the '''Dakota Apartments''',<ref name="nhlsum" /> is a [[Housing cooperative|cooperative]] apartment building located on the northwest corner of [[72nd Street (Manhattan)|72nd Street]] and [[Central Park West]] in the [[Upper West Side]] of the [[Boroughs of New York City|borough]] of [[Manhattan]] in [[New York City]], United States. Its construction was completed in 1884. The Dakota was the home of [[John Lennon]], a former member of [[the Beatles]], from 1973 until [[Murder of John Lennon|his murder]] in the archway of the building in 1980.

}}

The Dakota was constructed between October 25, 1880, and October 27, 1884.<ref>Brockmann, Jorg ''et al.'' (2002), {{Google books |gJR_PahlUtIC&dq |''One Thousand New York Buildings,'' pp. 342–343. |page=342}}</ref> [[Henry Janeway Hardenbergh]]'s architectural firm was commissioned to create the design for [[Edward Cabot Clark]], head of the [[Singer Corporation|Singer Manufacturing Company]].
The building purportedly was named The Dakota because at the time of its construction, the area was sparsely inhabited and considered remote from the inhabited area of Manhattan, just as the [[Dakota Territory]] was considered remote. The earliest appearance of this story, however, was in a 1933 newspaper interview with The Dakota's long-time manager. Christopher Gray's book ''New York Streetscapes'' quotes the interaction thus: "Probably it was called 'Dakota' because it was so far west and so far north". Gray believed that the building's name stemmed from Clark's fondness for the names of the new western states and territories.<ref>{{cite book |last=Gray |first=Christopher |title=New York Streetscapes |publisher=Harry N. Abrams, Inc. |pages=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780810944411/page/326 326–328] |isbn=0-8109-4441-3 |date=2003-05-01 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780810944411/page/326 }}</ref>

The Dakota was designated a [[New York City Landmark]] in 1969.<ref>Birmingham, Stephen. (1996). [https://books.google.com/books?id=OGEDiKOujjgC&pg=PA131&dq= ''Life at the Dakota: New York's Most Unusual Address,'' pp. 130-131].</ref> It was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1972,<ref name="nris"/> and was designated as a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1976.<ref name="nhlsum"/><ref>{{cite journal |url={{NHLS url |id=72000869}} |title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory: Dakota Apartments |author=Carolyn Pitts |format=PDF |date=August 10, 1976 |publisher=National Park Service |accessdate=June 21, 2009}} and {{NHLS url |id=72000869 |title=Accompanying photos, exterior, undated |photos=y}}&nbsp;{{small|(1.65 MB)}}</ref>

The building's [[facade]] was renovated in 2015.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ny.curbed.com/archives/2015/04/03/the_iconic_dakota_built_in_1884_is_getting_some_work_done.php |title=The Iconic Dakota, Built in 1884, Is Getting Some Work Done |work=Curbed NY}}</ref>

==Features==

[[File:Dakota Elevation.svg|thumb|upright=1.2|right|Elevation (south, the front of the building)]]

The building's high [[gable]]s and deep roofs with a profusion of [[dormer]]s, terracotta [[spandrel]]s and panels, [[niche (architecture)|niches]], balconies, and [[baluster|balustrades]] give it a [[German Renaissance]] character and an echo of a [[Hanseatic League|Hanseatic]] town hall. Its layout and [[floor plan]], however, were strongly influenced by French architectural trends in housing design that had become known in New York City in the 1870s. High above the 72nd Street entrance sits the face of a [[Sioux|Dakota]] Indian.<ref name="nya">{{cite web |url=http://www.newyorkitecture.com/dakota-apartments/ |title=New York Architecture Photos: Dakota Apartments |work=NewYorkitecture|date=February 22, 2015 }}</ref><ref name="nyclpc">{{cite web |url=http://neighborhoodpreservationcenter.org/db/bb_files/DAKOTA-APTS.pdf |title=NYC Landmarks Preservation Commission designation report |accessdate=May 3, 2018}}</ref>

The Dakota is a square building built around a central courtyard. The arched main entrance is a ''[[porte-cochère]]'' large enough for the horse-drawn carriages that once entered and allowed passengers to disembark sheltered from the weather. Many of these carriages were housed in a multi-story stable building built in two sections between 1891 and 1894, at the southwest corner of 77th Street and [[Tenth Avenue (Manhattan)|Amsterdam Avenue]], where elevators lifted them to the upper floors. The "Dakota Stables" building was in operation as a garage until February 2007, when it was slated to be transformed by the Related Companies into a condominium residence.<ref>Christopher Gray: [https://www.nytimes.com/1987/05/24/realestate/streetscapes-the-dakota-stables-a-soft-site-garage-on-the-booming-west-side.html "Streetscapes: The Dakota Stables; A 'Soft-Site' Garage on the Booming West Side"], ''The New York Times'', May 24, 1987; accessed December 7, 2010.</ref> Since then, the large condominium building The Harrison occupies its spot.<ref name="nya"/><ref name="nyclpc"/>

The general layout of the apartments is in the French style of the period, with all major rooms connected to each other, in ''[[enfilade (architecture)|enfilade]]'', and also accessible from a hall or corridor. The arrangement allows a natural migration for guests from one room to another, especially on festive occasions, yet gives service staff discreet separate circulation patterns that offer service access to the main rooms. The principal rooms, such as parlors or the master bedroom, face the street, while the dining room, kitchen, and other auxiliary rooms are oriented toward the courtyard. Apartments thus are aired from two sides, which was a relative novelty in Manhattan at the time. Some of the drawing rooms are {{convert|49|ft}} long, and many of the ceilings are {{convert|14|ft}} high. The floors are inlaid with [[mahogany]], [[oak]], and [[cherry]].<ref name="nya"/><ref name="nyclpc"/>

Originally, The Dakota had 65 apartments with four to 20 rooms, no two apartments being alike. These apartments are accessed by staircases and elevators placed in the four corners of the courtyard. Separate service stairs and elevators serving the kitchens are located mid-block. Built to cater to the well-to-do, The Dakota featured many amenities and a modern infrastructure that was exceptional for the time. The building has a large dining hall. Meals also could be sent up to the apartments by [[dumbwaiter]]s. Electricity was generated by an in-house power plant, and the building has [[central heating]]. Beside servant quarters, there was a playroom and a gymnasium under the roof. In later years, these spaces on the tenth floor were converted into apartments. The Dakota property also contained a garden, private [[croquet]] lawns, and a tennis court behind the building between 72nd and 73rd Streets.<ref name="nya"/><ref name="nyclpc"/>

All apartments were let before the building opened, but it was a long-term drain on the fortune of Clark, who died before it was completed, and his heirs. For the high society of Manhattan, it became fashionable to live in the building, or at least to rent an apartment there as a secondary city residence, and The Dakota's success prompted the construction of many other luxury apartment buildings in Manhattan.<ref name="nya"/><ref name="nyclpc"/>

An entrance to the [[72nd Street (IND Eighth Avenue Line)|72nd Street]] station of the [[New York City Subway]]'s {{NYCS trains|Eighth center local header}} is outside the building.<ref>{{Google maps |url=https://www.google.com/maps/@40.776387,-73.975833,3a,75y,308.73h,76.84t/data=!3m5!1e1!3m3!1sqM4gGqyQOvY3EvobLFsXog!2e0!5s20130801T000000?hl=en |title=Street view of The Dakota |accessdate=May 12, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{Cite NYCS map|neighborhood|Upper West Side}}</ref>

Although historically home to many creative or artistic people, the building and its co-op board of directors were criticized in 2005 by former resident Albert Maysles. He attempted to sell his ownership to actors [[Melanie Griffith]] and [[Antonio Banderas]], who were rejected by the board. Maysles expressed his "disappointment with the way the building seems to be changing" by telling ''[[The New York Times]]'': "What's so shocking is that the building is losing its touch with interesting people. More and more, they're moving away from creative people and going toward people who just have the money."<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/19/realestate/19deal.html?pagewanted=all |work=The New York Times |title=New Co-op for Soup Executive |first=William |last=Neuman |date=June 19, 2005 |accessdate=May 25, 2010}}</ref> Even before this, [[Gene Simmons]],<ref>Tony Schwartz.

==Cultural significance==
The south entrance of the building was the location of the murder of John Lennon and is prominently featured in [[Andrew Piddington]]'s 2006 film ''[[The Killing of John Lennon]]'', although the Dakota itself was only used for exterior shots. In [[Roman Polanski]]'s 1968 film ''[[Rosemary's Baby (film)|Rosemary's Baby]]'', the Dakota was used for exterior shots of "The Bramford", the apartment building in which the story takes place.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cbsnews.com/pictures/horror-movie-locations-then-and-now/3/ |title=Horror Movie Locations Then and Now |publisher=CBS News |access-date=November 11, 2018}}</ref>. In [[Jack Finney]]'s 1970 novel ''[[Time and Again (Finney novel)|Time and Again]]'' the Dakota enables time travel.
