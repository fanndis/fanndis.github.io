'''Pathlight School''' is a [[special school]] for [[High-functioning autism|high-functioning]] children with [[autism]], located in [[Ang Mo Kio]], [[Singapore]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=Goh|first=Yan Han|date=2019-08-21|title=More kids with autism, raising demand for school places|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/more-kids-with-autism-raising-demand-for-school-places|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-10-29|website=The Straits Times|language=en}}</ref> Founded in 2004, it is run by the non-profit [[Autism Resource Centre]], and comprises one half of the national educational provision for autistic children. The school coaches students in social and life skills, teaches them mainstream curriculum subjects and prepares them for employment, in an [[autism friendly]] environment. With more than 1000 pupils enrolled, the school has been noted for its achievements in special education in Singapore.

==History==
In 2003, the Autism Resource Centre (ARC) launched a project to provide comprehensive support for autistic Singaporeans, which included plans to set up the first autism-focused special school in Singapore. The ARC collaborated with the [[Rainbow Centre]] over a period of five months to renovate the temporary campus, recruit school staff, decide on the school values and develop the school programmes.<ref name="nxt">Ho Ka Wei, "School for autistic kids to open next year", ''The Sunday Times'', 20 July 2003.</ref> After opening in January 2004 with 10 teachers and 41 students,<ref name="pwl">Leow Si Wan, "[http://www.asiaone.com/News/Education/Story/A1Story20100428-212937.html A Path to work life]", ''[[The Straits Times]]'', 28 April 2010.</ref> Pathlight School conducted charity walks, merchandise sales and other events to raise funds for the introduction of more programmes for an expanding intake.<ref>"$335,000 raised for Pathlight School", ''[[Channel NewsAsia]]'', 5 August 2006.</ref> In 2007, two teachers from Pathlight School won the inaugural Most Outstanding Special Education Teacher Award and Most Innovative Special Education Teacher Award, given by the Singaporean [[Ministry of Education (Singapore)|Ministry of Education]] and [[National Council of Social Service]].<ref name="award">"[http://www.moe.gov.sg/media/press/2007/pr20071116.htm The inaugural MOE-NCSS Special Education Awards] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110920193609/http://www.moe.gov.sg/media/press/2007/pr20071116.htm |date=20 September 2011 }}", Ministry of Education press release, 16 November 2007.</ref> In 2009, the Autism Association of Singapore launched a second autism-focused special school, Eden School, and the two schools formed a partnership.<ref name="eden">Loh Chee Kong, "An Eden for autistic children", ''[[Today (Singapore newspaper)|Today]]'', 4 April 2009.</ref> The following year, Pathlight School moved to its permanent campus and announced plans to develop student internship programmes,<ref name="award"/> build an information technology centre, and set up a [[lifelong learning]] club for alumni.<ref name="pwl"/>

==Campus==
The permanent campus of Pathlight School at Ang Mo Kio Avenue 10, which was constructed by W Architects and cost [[S$]]34 million to build, spans {{convert|1.6|ha|km2 sqmi}}. Its facilities include 45 classrooms, four computer labs, three courtyards, an industrial kitchen and a multi-purpose area, as well as special art, music and design rooms.<ref name="pwl"/><ref name="dna">"[http://www.autism.org.sg/press/2010/0901-a_unified_whole-d+a.pdf A Unified Whole] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150810153411/http://www.autism.org.sg/press/2010/0901-a_unified_whole-d+a.pdf |date=10 August 2015 }}", d+a magazine, Issue 53, 2010.</ref> The campus was designed to offer students "dignity" and an [[autism friendly]] environment. For example, the walls and floors have a simple colour scheme, to avoid triggering [[sensory overload]], while the taps in the canteen are slightly different from each other to help students learn to adopt less rigid routines.<ref name="dna"/> Due to limited facilities, some academic lessons, known as [[List of secondary schools in Singapore|satellite class]]es, are conducted by Pathlight teachers at nearby mainstream schools, including [[Mayflower Secondary School]], [[Peirce Secondary School]], and [[Yio Chu Kang Secondary School]].

Campus 2 Annex building was formerly used by [[Chong Boon Secondary School]] (merged with [[Yio Chu Kang Secondary School]])

As of 2012, they introduced two campuses as Primary 1 to 4 and Vocational Track were in Campus 1 while Primary 5 to 6 and Secondary School were in Campus 2.

In 2013, Primary 4 was moved to Campus 2 and in 2015 the Primary 3 were moved to Campus 2 and for Secondary School moved to Campus 1.  Satellite schools assigned tend to vary year by year thus affecting integration. In 2018, Primary 6, Secondary and Track V moved to Campus 2 Annex and in 2020 the Primary 2 split into Campus 1 and 2 Main and Primary 5 moved to Campus 2 Annex.

==Programmes==
Unlike most special schools in Singapore, which place little emphasis on academics, Pathlight School uses the same academic curriculum as mainstream primary and secondary schools.
