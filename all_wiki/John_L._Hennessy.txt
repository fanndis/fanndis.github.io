==Career==

Hennessy became a Stanford faculty member in 1977. In 1981, he began the [[Stanford MIPS|MIPS]] project to investigate [[RISC]] [[Central processing unit|processor]]s, and in 1984, he used his sabbatical year to found [[MIPS Computer Systems Inc.]] to commercialize the technology developed by his research. In 1987, he became the Willard and Inez Kerr Bell Endowed Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science.<ref name="Curriculum Vitae"/>

Hennessy served as director of Stanford's Computer System Laboratory (1989–93), a research center run by Stanford's Electrical Engineering and Computer Science departments. He was chair of the Department of Computer Science (1994–96) and Dean of the School of Engineering (1996–99).<ref name="Curriculum Vitae"/>

In 1999, Stanford President [[Gerhard Casper]] appointed Hennessy to succeed [[Condoleezza Rice]] as [[Provost (education)|Provost]] of Stanford University. When Casper stepped down to focus on teaching in 2000, the Stanford Board of Trustees named Hennessy to succeed Casper as president. In 2008, Hennessy earned a salary of $1,091,589 ($702,771 base salary, $259,592 deferred benefits, $129,226 non-tax benefits), the 23rd highest among all American university presidents.<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2010-11-14/college-president-salaries-ranking-the-million-dollar-earners/|title=Million-Dollar College Presidents|publisher=[[The Daily Beast]]|date=November 14, 2010|accessdate=April 26, 2011}}</ref>

In December 2010, Hennessy coauthored an editorial with [[Harvard University]] President [[Drew Gilpin Faust]] urging the passage of the [[DREAM Act]];<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1210/46124.html|title=Deserving of the DREAM|publisher=[[Politico]]|date=December 8, 2010|accessdate=April 26, 2011}}</ref> the legislation did not pass the [[111th United States Congress]].

In 2013, Hennessy became a judge for the inaugural [[Queen Elizabeth Prize for Engineering]]. He has remained on the judging panel for the subsequent awards in 2015 and 2017.

In June 2015, Hennessy announced that he would step down as Stanford president in summer 2016.<ref>{{cite web|title=Stanford University President John L. Hennessy to step down in 2016|url=http://news.stanford.edu/news/2015/june/stanford-anouncement-061115.html|date=2015-06-11}}</ref>

In 2016, Hennessy co-founded the [[Knight-Hennessy Scholars]] program; he serves as its inaugural director.

==Research==
Hennessy has a history of strong interest and involvement in college-level computer education. He co-authored, with [[David A. Patterson (scientist)|David A. Patterson]], two well-known books on [[computer architecture]], ''Computer Organization and Design: the Hardware/Software Interface'' and ''Computer Architecture: A Quantitative Approach'',<ref name="quantitative">{{cite book |author1=Patterson, David |author2=Hennessy, John H. |author3=Arpaci-Dusseau, Andrea C. |title=Computer architecture: a quantitative approach |publisher=Morgan Kaufmann |location=San Diego |year=2007 |pages= |isbn=978-0-12-370490-0 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref> which introduced the [[DLX]] RISC architecture. They have been widely used as [[textbook]]s for graduate and undergraduate courses since 1990.{{citation needed|date=May 2008}}

Hennessy also contributed to updating [[Donald Knuth]]'s [[MIX]] processor to the [[MMIX]]. Both are model computers used in Knuth's classic series, ''[[The Art of Computer Programming]]''. MMIX is Knuth's DLX equivalent.
