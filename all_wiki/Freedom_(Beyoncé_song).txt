The song was written by [[Jonny Coffer]], Beyoncé, Carla Marie Williams, Dean McIntosh (Arrow Benjamin), Lamar, Frank Tirado, [[Alan Lomax]] and [[John Lomax, Sr.]] while its production was handled by Coffer, Beyoncé and hip hop record producer [[Just Blaze]]. It contains three musical samples: "Let Me Try", written by Frank Tirado, performed by [[Kaleidoscope]]; "Collection Speech/Unidentified Lining Hymn" (1959), recorded by [[Alan Lomax]], performed by Reverend R.C. Crenshaw; and "Stewball" (1947), recorded by Alan Lomax and [[John Lomax, Sr.]], performed by Prisoner "22" at [[Mississippi State Penitentiary at Parchman]].<ref name="credits">{{cite AV media notes|title=Lemonade|others=[[Beyoncé]]|year=2016|publisher=[[Columbia Records]]/[[Parkwood Entertainment]]}}</ref> "Freedom" was [[Audio mixing (recorded music)|mixed]] and recorded by Stuart White at Pacifique Recording Studios and The Beehive respectively. Its [[audio engineer]]ing was finished by Ramon Rivas with the assistance of John Cranfield. [[Arrow Benjamin]], who collaborated with Beyoncé on "[[Runnin' (Lose It All)]]" by musician [[Naughty Boy]] in 2015, served as the [[backing vocalist]].<ref name="credits" /> [[Boots (musician)|Boots]] and Myles William were responsible for the [[Programming (music)|programming]] while Dave Kutch [[Audio mastering|mastered]] the song at The Mastering Palace NYC in North Holywood, California.

==Critical reception==
''[[Pitchfork Media|Pitchfork]]'' named the song "Best New Track", with the editor Britt Jullious commenting "After songs of paranoia, anger, and revenge, we finally get a song that speaks truth to Beyoncé’s deep well of feelings. Bathed in psychedelic, synthetic organs and a propulsive drum beat, the track cuts straight, providing an alternative narrative of personal redemption. It is also the explanatory work on ''Lemonade''."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/18214-beyonce-freedom-ft-kendrick-lamar/|title=“Freedom” [ft.

''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' writer Nash Jankins opined that the "intense, thoroughly choreographed" performance of the song with the King snippet, was a further proof of Beyoncé becoming more politically involved with her music.<ref name="time" /> Similarly, August Brown of ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' deemed the rendition "powerful, politically and aesthetically charged," and felt that it was evocative of concepts found on ''Lemonade'' with its "[[Hurricane Katrina]] floods, imagery of the African diaspora, and the relationships between personal and national traumas". Brown went on saying that the politically charged performance came in during a right time, when the matters of [[black pride]], [[xenophobia]] and [[racial justice]] were highly discussed and finished his review by concluding that watching Beyoncé and Lamar perform was "a consummation of everything good and right in pop music today".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/music/la-et-ms-beyonce-kendrick-20160626-snap-story.html|title=Beyoncé and Kendrick Lamar open the BET Awards with a rebellious performance|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|first=August|last=Brown|date=June 26, 2016|accessdate=June 27, 2016}}</ref> ''[[The Daily Beast]]''{{'}}s Marlow Stern called it the show's "shock opener" with its themes of [[slavery]] and the [[Black Lives Matter]] movement, and noted how seeing the duo perform together was "truly a sight to behold".<ref name="beast" /> Matthew Dessem, writing for ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' magazine, noted how the "spectacular" performance was suitable for being an [[Olympic Games ceremony|Olympic opening ceremony]]. He praised both singers for being in their top forms, with Beyoncé particularly being "note-perfect" and summarized the performance as "the rare case of a performer as hyped as Beyoncé actually exceeding sky-high expectations".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2016/06/26/beyonc_and_kendrick_lamar_performed_freedom_at_the_bet_awards.html|title=Beyoncé and Kendrick Lamar Kicked Off the BET Awards With a Killer Version of "Freedom"|first=Matthew|last=Dessem|work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|date=June 26, 2016|accessdate=June 27, 2016}}</ref>
