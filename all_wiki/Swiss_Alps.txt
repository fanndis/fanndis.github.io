The [[Alps|Alpine]] region of [[Switzerland]], conventionally referred to as the '''''Swiss Alps''''' ({{lang-de|Schweizer Alpen}}, {{lang-fr|Alpes suisses}}, {{lang-it|Alpi svizzere}}, {{lang-rm|Alps svizras}}), represents a major natural feature of the country and is, along with the [[Swiss Plateau]] and the Swiss portion of the [[Jura Mountains]], one of its three main [[Physical geography|physiographic]] regions. The Swiss Alps extend over both the [[Western Alps]] and the [[Eastern Alps]], encompassing an area sometimes called ''Central Alps''.<ref>{{cite book |last= Ball |first= John |author-link= John Ball (naturalist) |date=1873 |title=The Central Alps |url=https://archive.org/details/centralalpsincl00ballgoog | publisher= Longmans, Green & Co}}</ref> While the northern ranges from the [[Bernese Alps]] to the [[Appenzell Alps]] are entirely in Switzerland, the southern ranges from the [[Mont Blanc massif]] to the [[Bernina Range|Bernina massif]] are shared with other countries such as [[France]], [[Italy]], [[Austria]] and [[Liechtenstein]].

The Swiss Alps comprise almost all the highest mountains of the [[Alps]], such as [[Dufourspitze]] (4,634 m), the [[Dom (mountain)|Dom]] (4,545 m), the [[Liskamm]] (4,527 m), the [[Weisshorn]] (4,506 m) and the [[Matterhorn]] (4,478 m). The other following major summits can be found in this [[list of mountains of Switzerland]].

Since the [[Middle Ages]], transit across the Alps played an important role in history. The region north of [[St Gotthard Pass]] became the [[Foundation of the Old Swiss Confederacy|nucleus]] of the [[Old Swiss Confederacy|Swiss Confederacy]] in the early 14th century.

[[File:10127 Berner Alpen Prêles.jpg|thumb|Swiss Alps seen from the Swiss Jura in December 2010]]
The Alps cover 60% of Switzerland's total {{convert|41285|km2|sqmi}} surface area, making it one of the most ''[[Alpine states|alpine]]'' countries. Despite the fact that Switzerland covers only 14% of the Alps total {{convert|192753|km2|sqmi}} area,<ref>Werner Bätzing, Henri Rougier, ''Les Alpes: Un foyer de civilisation au coeur de l'Europe'', page 21, {{ISBN|2-606-00294-6}}</ref><ref>Area defined by the ''Alpine Convention'' (website: [http://www.alpconv.org/index_en alpconv.org] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110729001545/http://www.alpconv.org/index_en |date=2011-07-29 }})</ref> 48 out of 82 [[List of Alpine four-thousanders|alpine four-thousanders]] are located in the Swiss Alps and practically all{{color|blue|<sup>{number(s) needed}</sup>}} of the remaining 34 are within {{convert|20|km|mi}} of the country's border.

The glaciers of the Swiss Alps cover an area of {{convert|1220|km2|sqmi}} — 3% of the Swiss territory, representing 44% of the total glaciated area in the Alps i.e. {{convert|2800|km2|sqmi}}.

The Swiss Alps are situated south of the [[Swiss Plateau]] and north of the national border. The limit between the Alps and the plateau runs from [[Vevey]] on the shores of [[Lake Geneva]] to [[Rorschach, St. Gallen|Rorschach]] on the shores of [[Lake Constance]], passing close to the cities of [[Thun]] and [[Lucerne]].<ref>According to the limit defined by the Alpine Convention</ref> The not well defined regions in Switzerland that lie on the margin of the Alps, especially those on the north side, are called the ''Swiss Prealps''<ref>The Swiss Prealps should not be confused with the homonymous region defined by the [[SOIUSA]] classification of the Alps, with the [[Schilthorn]] as main summit.</ref> (''Préalpes'' in French, ''Voralpen'' in German, ''Prealpi'' in Italian). The Swiss Prealps are mainly made of limestone and they generally do not exceed {{convert|2500|m|ft}}.<ref>{{HDS|8564}}</ref>

The Alpine [[Cantons of Switzerland|cantons]] (from highest to lowest) are [[Canton of Valais|Valais]], [[Canton of Bern|Bern]], [[Canton of Grisons|Graubünden]], [[Canton of Uri|Uri]], [[Canton of Glarus|Glarus]], [[Canton of Ticino|Ticino]], [[Canton of St. Gallen|St. Gallen]], [[Canton of Vaud|Vaud]], [[Canton of Obwalden|Obwalden]], [[Canton of Nidwalden|Nidwalden]], [[Canton of Schwyz|Schwyz]], [[Canton of Appenzell Innerrhoden|Appenzell Innerrhoden]], [[Canton of Appenzell Ausserrhoden|Appenzell Ausserrhoden]], [[Canton of Fribourg|Fribourg]], [[Canton of Lucerne|Lucerne]] and [[Canton of Zug|Zug]]. The countries with which Switzerland shares mountain ranges of the Alps are (from west to east): [[France]], [[Italy]], [[Austria]] and [[Liechtenstein]].

===Ranges===
The Alps are usually divided into two main parts, the [[Western Alps]] and [[Eastern Alps]], whose division is along the [[Rhine]] from Lake Constance to the [[Splügen Pass]]. The western ranges occupy the greatest part of Switzerland while the more numerous eastern ranges are much smaller and are all situated in the [[canton of Graubünden]]. The latter is part of the [[Central Eastern Alps]], except the [[Ortler Alps]] which belong to the [[Southern Limestone Alps]]. The [[Pennine Alps|Pennine]], [[Bernese Alps|Bernese]] and [[Bernina Range]] are the highest ranges of the country, they contain respectively 38, 9 and 1 summit over 4000 meters. The lowest range is the [[Appenzell Alps]] culminating at 2,500 meters.

===Hydrography===
{{See also|Valleys of the Alps}}

====Rivers====
{{See also|List of rivers in Switzerland}}
[[File:Rhine.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ruinaulta|Rhine Gorge]] in Graubünden]]
The north side of the Swiss Alps is drained by the [[Rhône]], [[Rhine]] and [[Inn (river)|Inn]] (which is part of the Danube basin) while the south side is mainly drained by the [[Ticino (river)|Ticino]] (Po basin). The rivers on the north empty into the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]], [[North Sea|North]] and [[Black Sea]], on the south the Po empty in the [[Adriatic Sea]]. The major triple watersheds in the Alps are located within the country, they are: [[Piz Lunghin]], [[Witenwasserenstock]] and [[Monte Forcola]]. Between the Witenwasserenstock and Piz Lunghin runs the [[European Watershed]] separating the basin of the [[Atlantic]] (the North Sea) and the Mediterranean Sea (Adriatic and the Black Sea). The European watershed lies only partially on the [[Main chain of the Alps|main chain]]. Switzerland possesses 6% of Europe's freshwater, and is sometimes referred to as the "water tower of Europe".

====Lakes====
{{See also|List of lakes of Switzerland|List of mountain lakes of Switzerland}}
[[File:Dix.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Lac des Dix]] in Valais]]
Since the [[List of tallest dams in Switzerland|highest dams]] are located in Alpine regions, many large mountain lakes are [[List of lakes with a dam in Switzerland|artificial]] and are used as hydroelectric reservoirs.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=FSgDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA61&dq=popular+science+1930&hl=en&ei=VGmeTrjzHMfhsQLNr5H1CQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=5&ved=0CEAQ6AEwBDgK#v=onepage&q=popular%20science%201930&f=true "Dam Begun in Swiss Alps to be Europe's Highest."] ''Popular Science'', November 1929, p. 61</ref> Some large artificial lakes can be found above 2,300 m, but natural lakes larger than 1&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> are generally below 1,000 m (with the exceptions of lakes in the [[Engadin]] such as [[Lake Sils]], and [[Oeschinen Lake|Oeschinen]] in the Bernese Oberland). The melting of low-altitude glaciers can generate new lakes, such as the 0.25&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> large [[Triftsee]] which formed between 2002–2003.

===Hydroelectricity Impacts due to Glacial Melting===
Switzerland has been using this concerning transition in climate as a positive opportunity to develop new innovations and to change the ways that energy is being produced in the country. Switzerland depends on the use of [[hydroelectricity]] to power nearby communities, but as glaciers melt and stop refreezing, the melting that creates the energy ceases to exist. Researchers have been evaluating how the topography will change as the glaciers begin to decrease and they are looking more deeply into potential construction costs, energy production, and future problems they might encounter with these new developments. Switzerland is one of many countries that need to begin to think about the future of energy production in response to climate change. Switzerland is paving the way for a new wave of innovation and creative problem solving that the rest of the world will eventually need to follow.

===Monitoring Glacial Changes Over Time===
PERMOS (The Swiss Permafrost Monitoring Network) is an operational monitoring service, and its main goal is to create long-term scientific documentation of the permafrost changes in the Swiss Alps. To accurately represent the current conditions of the Alps, the network records permafrost temperatures and thermal changes in boreholes, the bottom temperature of the snow cover, ground surface temperature, and the development of snow cover. The network additionally takes air photos periodically from selected areas. These monitoring strategies continue to develop as new research and data are recorded over time.<ref>PERMOS monitoring((www.permos.ch/downloads/permos00-02.pdf.))</ref>

==Geology==
{{Main|Geology of the Alps}}
{{See also|List of glaciers in Switzerland}}
[[Image: Lauterbrunnental train.jpg|thumb|[[Lauterbrunnen]] Valley in the Bernese Alps, a deep U-shaped valley that resulted from erosion by glaciers]]

The composition of the great tectonic units reflects the history of the formation of the Alps. The rocks from the [[Helvetic zone]] on the north and the [[Austroalpine nappes]] – [[Southern Alps (geology)|Southern Alps]] on the south come originally from the European and African continent respectively. The rocks of the [[Penninic nappes]] belong to the former area of the [[Briançonnais microcontinent]] and the [[Tethys Ocean]]. The closure of the latter by subduction under the African plate ([[Piemont-Liguria Ocean|Piemont Ocean]] first and [[Valais Ocean]] later) preceded the collision between the two plates and the so-called alpine orogeny. The major thrust fault of the [[Glarus thrust|Tectonic Arena Sardona]] in the eastern Glarus Alps gives a visible illustration of mountain-building processes and was therefore declared a UNESCO World Heritage. Another fine example gives the [[Alpstein]] area with several visible upfolds of Helvetic zone material.

With some exceptions, the Alps north of [[Rhône]] and [[Rhine]] are part of the Helvetic Zone and those on the south side are part of the Penninic nappes. The Austroalpine zone concerns almost only the Eastern Alps, with the notable exception of the [[Matterhorn]].

The last [[glaciation]]s greatly transformed Switzerland's landscape. Many valleys of the Swiss Alps are U-shaped due to glacial erosion. During the maximum extension of the [[Würm glaciation]] (18,000 years ago) the glaciers completely covered the [[Swiss Plateau]], before retreating and leaving remnants only in high mountain areas. In modern times the [[Aletsch Glacier]] in the western Bernese Alps is the largest and longest in the Alps, reaching a maximum depth of 900 meters at [[Konkordiaplatz]]. Along with the [[Fiescher Glacier|Fiescher]] and [[Aar Glaciers]], the region became a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2001. An effect of the retreat of the Rhine Glacier some 10,000 years ago was the [[Flims Rockslide]], the biggest still visible [[landslide]] worldwide.

==Environment and climate==
To protect endangered species some sites have been brought under protection. The [[Swiss National Park]] in Graubünden was established in 1914 as the first alpine national park. The [[Entlebuch Biosphere|Entlebuch]] area was designated a biosphere reserve in 2001. The largest protected area in the country is the [[Parc Ela]], opened in 2006, which covers an area of 600 square kilometres.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.swissworld.org/en/environment/biodiversity/nature_parks/ |title=Nature parks swissworld.org |access-date=2018-12-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090604070817/http://www.swissworld.org/en/environment/biodiversity/nature_parks |archive-date=2009-06-04 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The [[Jungfrau-Aletsch Protected Area]] is the first World Heritage Site in the Alps.

===Climate zones===
{{See also|Climate of the Alps}}

As the [[Lapse rate|temperature decreases]] with altitude (0.56&nbsp;°C per 100 meters on yearly average), three different altitudinal zones, each having distinct climate, are found in the Swiss Alps:

*'''Subalpine zone'''
[[File:Val Trupchun.jpg|thumb|right|Tree line in the national park]]
[[File:Liskamm, Zermatt.jpg|thumb|right|[[Liskamm]] (4,527 m), above the [[Grenzgletscher|Border Glacier]]]]
The [[Subalpine zone]] is the region that lies below the [[tree line]]. It is the most important region as it is the largest of the three and contains almost all human settlements as well as the productive areas. The forests are mainly composed by [[conifer]]s above 1,200–1,400 meters, the [[deciduous]] tree forest is confined to lower elevations. The upper limit of the Subalpine zone is located at about 1,800 meters on the north side of the Alps and about 2,000 meters on the south side. It can, however, differ in some regions such as the Appenzell Alps (1,600 meters) or the Engadin valley (2,300 meters).

*'''Alpine zone'''
The [[Alpine tundra|Alpine zone]] is situated above the tree line and is clear of trees because of low average temperatures. It contains mostly grass and small plants along with mountain flowers. Below the [[permafrost]] limit (at about 2,600 meters), the [[alpine meadow]]s are often used as pastures. Some villages can still be found on the lowest altitudes such as [[Riederalp]] (1,940 m) or [[Juf]] (2,130 m). The extent of the Alpine zone is limited by the first permanent snow, its altitude greatly varies depending on the location (and orientation), it comprises between 2,800 and 3,200 meters.

*'''Glacial zone'''
The glacial zone is the area of permanent snow and ice. When the steepness of the slope is not too high it results in an accumulation and compaction of snow, which transforms into ice. The glacier-formed then flows down the valley and can reach as far down as 1,500 meters (the [[Upper Grindelwald Glacier]]). Where the slopes are too steep, the snow accumulates to form overhanging [[serac]]s, which periodically fall off due to the downward movement of the glacier and cause ice avalanches. The Bernese Alps, Pennine Alps, and Mont Blanc Massif contain most of the glaciated areas in the Alps. Except for research stations such as the [[Sphinx Observatory]], no settlements are to be found in those regions.

===Negative Impacts to Nearby Populations due to Glacial Melting===
Due to the change in weather patterns, the summers are expected to continue getting warmer and drier, while the winters are expected to become moister. This change in the weather increases the chances of flooding with heavier rainfall, the melting of [[permafrost]] zones, a change in the geography and wildlife, and the occurrence of more deadly rock slides. Furthermore, natural hazards are occurring more frequently, such as floods, avalanches, and landslides. Additionally, the water supply that the glaciers originally provided is on the decline, which is problematic for producing energy, agricultural practices, and other human use. Finally, the glacial melting puts the economy is at risk because there will be less incoming financial revenue from the tourism and recreation services that these glaciers and ecosystems typically provide. All of these impacts will disrupt the nearby communities and require that updated infrastructure and safety measures be put into place to prevent mass destruction.

==Travel and tourism==
[[Image:Glacier3000.jpg|thumb|right|[[Glacier 3000]]]]

[[Tourism in Switzerland|Tourism]] in the Swiss Alps began with the first ascents of the main peaks of the Alps ([[Jungfrau]] in 1811, [[Piz Bernina]] in 1850, [[Monte Rosa]] in 1855, [[Matterhorn]] in 1856, [[Dom (mountain)|Dom]] in 1858, [[Weisshorn]] in 1861) mostly by British mountain climbers accompanied by the local guides. The construction of facilities for tourists started in the mid-nineteenth century with the building of hotels and [[mountain hut]]s (creation of the [[Swiss Alpine Club]] in 1863) and the opening of mountain train lines on ([[Rigi (mountain)|Rigi]] in 1873, [[Pilatus (mountain)|Pilatus]] in 1889, [[Gornergrat]] in 1898). The Jungfraubahn opened in 1912; it leads to the highest railway station in Europe, the [[Jungfraujoch]].

===Summer tourism===
Switzerland enjoys a 62,000-km network of well-maintained trails, of which 23,000 are located in mountainous areas. Many mountains attract a large number of [[alpinist]]s from around the world, especially the 4000-meter summits and the [[Great north faces of the Alps|great north faces]] ([[Eiger]], [[Matterhorn]] and [[Piz Badile]]). The large winter resorts are also popular destinations in summer, as most of [[List of aerial tramways in Switzerland|aerial tramways]] operate through the year, enabling hikers and mountaineers to reach high altitudes without much effort. The [[Klein Matterhorn]] is the highest summit of the European continent to be served by cable car.

===Winter tourism===
{{Main|List of ski areas and resorts in Switzerland}}
[[File:Breithorn plateau.jpg|thumb|Highest ski area in Europe above Zermatt]]
The major destinations for [[skiing]] and other [[winter sports]] are located in [[Valais]], [[Bernese Oberland]] and [[Graubünden]]. Some villages are car-free and can be accessed only with public transports such as [[Riederalp]] and [[Bettmeralp]].<ref>There are in total 9 car-free villages members of the GAST (Gemeinschaft Autofreier Tourismusorte): [[Bettmeralp]], [[Braunwald, Glarus|Braunwald]], [[Riederalp]], [[Rigi]], [[Saas-Fee]], [[Stoos]], [[Wengen]], [[Mürren]] and [[Zermatt]].</ref> [[Zermatt]] and [[Saas-Fee]] have both summer ski areas. The ski season starts from as early as November and runs to as late as May; however, the majority of ski resorts in Switzerland tend to open in December and run through to April.

who put his skis on in his hotel bedroom in 1881 and walked out through the hotel Bar to the slopes wearing them.<ref name="Skiing the Alps">[http://skiingthealps.com/Default.aspx?go=Resort&ResortID=74 Skiing the Alps]</ref>

===Popular Snow Activities===
{Main|List of available snow activities}
Some major sporting activities include: 
*Skiing
*Snowboarding
*Snow sled-biking
*Downhill snow Mountain Biking
*Downhill snow-mobile (as well as snow-mobile tours and rides)
*And loads more.

===Tourism Impacts due to Climate Change===
Climate change is impacting European Alpine tourism due to the increasing number and intensity of natural hazards, and it is endangering the accessibility and the infrastructure of tourism destinations. Melting glaciers are affecting the attractiveness of the Alpine landscape, increasing winter temperatures will result in a shorter skiing season, and these climate changes are limiting the amount of snow coverage produced. All of these climate and geographical factors are leading to a smaller number of visitors and reduced revenues which can have an intense economic impact on winter tourism. In response to these changes, Switzerland has turned to the production of [[artificial snow]] to match the demand for these tourist destinations and to uphold the structure and well-being of the economy.

The Swiss Alps and Switzerland enjoy an extensive [[Transport in Switzerland|transport network]]. Virtually every mountain village can be reached by public transport, either by [[Rail transport in Switzerland|rail]], bus, funicular, cable car, or usually a combination of them. The main companies of the coherently integrated public transport system are:

*[[Swiss Federal Railways|Swiss Federal Railways (SBB&nbsp;CFF&nbsp;FFS)]]
*[[Rhaetian Railway|Rhaetian Railway (RhB)]]
*[[Matterhorn Gotthard Bahn|Matterhorn Gotthard Bahn (MGB)]]
*[[GoldenPass Line]]
*[[PostBus Switzerland|PostBus]] (PostAuto / CarPostal / AutoPostale / Auto da Posta)

Most of the mountain regions are within 1 to 3 hours travel of [[List of cities in Switzerland|Switzerland's main cities]] and their respective [[List of airports in Switzerland|airport]]. The [[Engadin]]e in [[Graubünden]] is between 3 and 6 hours away from the large cities; the train journey itself, with the panoramic [[Glacier Express]] or [[Bernina Express]], is popular with tourists.

The [[Engadin Airport]] near [[St. Moritz]] at an altitude of 1,704 meters is the highest in Europe.

The crossing of the Alps is a key issue at national and international levels, as the European continent is at places divided by the range. Since the beginning of industrialisation Switzerland has improved its transalpine network; it began in 1882, by building the [[Gotthard Rail Tunnel]], followed in 1906 by the [[Simplon Tunnel]] and 1913 by the [[Lötschberg Tunnel]], and more recently, in 2007, by the [[Lötschberg Base Tunnel]]. The 57.1-km long [[Gotthard Base Tunnel]], the longest railway tunnel of the world, opened in 2016 and provides a direct flat rail link through the Alps.

Also a large number of peaks outside the Alps were named or nicknamed after Swiss mountains, such as the [[Wetterhorn Peak]] in [[Colorado]] or the [[Matterhorn Peak]] in [[California]] (see the [[Matterhorn#Other 'Matterhorns'|Matterhorn]] article for a list of ''Matterhorns in the world'').

The confluence of the [[Baltoro Glacier]] and the [[Godwin-Austen Glacier]] south of [[K2]] in the [[Karakoram]] range was named after the [[Konkordiaplatz]] by European explorers.
