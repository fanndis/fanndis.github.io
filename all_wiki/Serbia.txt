Continuously inhabited since the [[Paleolithic age|Paleolithic Age]], the territory of modern-day Serbia faced [[Slavic migrations]] to [[Southeastern Europe]] in the 6th century, establishing several regional [[Principality of Serbia (early medieval)|states]] in the early Middle Ages at times recognised as tributaries to the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]], [[Frankish Empire|Frankish]] and [[Royal Hungary|Hungarian]] kingdoms. The [[Kingdom of Serbia (medieval)|Serbian Kingdom]] obtained recognition by the [[Holy See]] and [[Constantinople]] in 1217, reaching its territorial apex in 1346 as the relatively short-lived [[Serbian Empire]]. By the mid-16th century, the [[Ottoman Turks|Ottomans]] annexed the entirety of modern-day Serbia; their rule was [[Ottoman–Habsburg wars|at times interrupted]] by the [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg Empire]], which began expanding towards [[Central Serbia]] from the end of the 17th century while maintaining a foothold in [[Vojvodina]].

==Etymology==
{{see also|Names of the Serbs and Serbia|Origin hypotheses of the Serbs}}

There exist two prevailing theories on the origin of the ethnonym ''*Sŕbъ'' (plur. ''*Sŕby''), one from a [[Proto-Slavic language]] with an appellative meaning of a "family kinship" and "alliance", while another from an [[Scythian languages|Iranian-Sarmatian language]] with various meanings.<ref name="Łuczyński">{{cite journal |last=Łuczyński |first=Michal |date=2017 |title="Geograf Bawarski" — nowe odczytania |trans-title="Bavarian Geographer" — New readings |url=https://rcin.org.pl/dlibra/show-content/publication/edition/64469?id=64469 |language=pl |journal=Polonica |volume=XXXVII |issue=37 |page=71 |doi=10.17651/POLON.37.9 |access-date=4 August 2020}}</ref><ref name="Rudnicki1959">{{cite book|last=Rudnicki|first=Mikołaj|author-link=Mikołaj Rudnicki|title=Prasłowiańszczyzna, Lechia-Polska|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R9IeAAAAMAAJ|year=1959|publisher=Państwowe wydawn. naukowe, Oddzia ︢w Poznaniu|language=pl|page=182}}</ref> In his work, ''[[De Administrando Imperio]]'', [[Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus]] suggests that the Serbs originated from [[White Serbia]] near [[Francia]]. According to the recorded tradition the [[Sorbs (tribe)|White Serbs]] split in two, with the half that became known as the Serbs coming down to settle Byzantine land. From 1945 to 1963, the official name for Serbia was the People's Republic of Serbia, later renamed the [[Socialist Republic of Serbia]] from 1963 to 1990. Since 1990, the official name of the country has been the Republic of Serbia.

Archaeological evidence of [[Paleolithic]] settlements on the territory of present-day Serbia is scarce. A fragment of a human jaw was found in [[Sićevo]] (Mala Balanica) and is believed to be up to 525,000–397,000 years old.{{sfn|Roksandic|2011|p=186–196}}

Approximately around 6,500 years BC, during the [[Neolithic]], the [[Starčevo culture|Starčevo]], and [[Vinča culture|Vinča]] cultures existed in the region of modern-day Belgrade. They dominated much of [[Southeastern Europe]] (as well as parts of [[Central Europe]] and [[Asia Minor]]). Several important archaeological sites from this era, including [[Lepenski Vir]] and [[Vinča-Belo Brdo]], still exist near the banks of the [[Danube]].{{sfn|Chapman|1981|p=}}{{sfn|Srejović|1988|p=}}

During the [[Iron Age]], local tribes of [[Triballi]], [[Dardani]], and [[Autariatae]] were encountered by the [[Ancient Greeks]] during their cultural and political expansion into the region, from the 5th up to the 2nd century BC. The Celtic tribe of [[Scordisci]] settled throughout the area in the 3rd century BC.

The [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] conquered much of the territory in the 2nd century BC. In 167 BC the [[Roman province]] of [[Illyricum (Roman province)|Illyricum]] was established; the remainder was conquered around 75 BC, forming the Roman province of [[Moesia Superior]]; the modern-day [[Srem District|Srem]] region was conquered in 9 BC; and Bačka and Banat in 106 AD after the [[Trajan's Dacian Wars|Dacian Wars]]. As a result of this, contemporary Serbia extends fully or partially over several former Roman provinces, including [[Moesia]], [[Pannonia]], [[Praevalitana]], [[Dalmatia]], [[Dacia]], and [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]].

The chief towns of [[Upper Moesia]] (and broader) were: Singidunum (Belgrade), [[Viminacium]] (now [[Kostolac|Old Kostolac]]), [[Remesiana]] (now [[Bela Palanka]]), Naissos (Niš), and [[Sirmium]] (now [[Sremska Mitrovica]]), the latter of which served as a Roman capital during the [[Tetrarchy]].{{sfn|Mirković|2017|p=79}} Seventeen Roman Emperors were born in the area of modern-day Serbia, second only to contemporary Italy.{{sfn|Kuzmanović|Mihajlović|2015|p=416-432}} The most famous of these was [[Constantine the Great]], the first Christian Emperor, who issued an edict ordering [[Edict of Milan|religious tolerance throughout the Empire]].

When the Roman Empire was divided in 395, most of Serbia remained under the [[Eastern Roman Empire]]. At the same time, its northwestern parts were included in the [[Western Roman Empire]]. By the 6th century, [[South Slavs]] migrated into the European provinces of the [[Byzantine Empire]] in large numbers.{{sfn|Ostrogorsky|1956|p=84}} They merged with the local [[Romanization (cultural)|Romanised]] population that was gradually assimilated.{{sfn|Stipčević|1977|p=76}}{{sfn|Fine|1991|p=38, 41}}{{sfn|Miller|2005|p=533}}

During the 11th and 12th century, [[Grand Principality of Serbia|Serbian state]] frequently fought with the neighbouring [[Byzantine Empire]].{{sfn|Ćirković|2004|p=23-24}} Between 1166 and 1371 Serbia was ruled by the [[Nemanjić dynasty]] (whose legacy is especially cherished), under whom the state was elevated to [[Kingdom of Serbia (medieval)|a kingdom]] in 1217,{{sfn|Ćirković|2004|p=38}} and an [[Serbian Empire|empire]] in 1346,{{sfn|Ćirković|2004|p=64}} under [[Stefan Dušan]]. [[Serbian Orthodox Church]] was organized as an [[Autocephaly|autocephalous]] archbishopric in 1219,{{sfn|Ćirković|2004|p=28}} through the effort of [[Saint Sava|Sava]], the country's patron saint, and in 1346 it was raised to the [[Serbian Patriarchate of Peć|Patriarchate]].

During these centuries the Serbian state (and influence) expanded significantly. The northern part (modern [[Vojvodina]]), was ruled by the [[Kingdom of Hungary]]. The period after 1371, known as the [[Fall of the Serbian Empire]] saw the once-powerful state fragmented into several principalities, culminating in the [[Battle of Kosovo]] (1389) against the rising [[Ottoman Empire]].{{sfn|Ćirković|2004|p=84-85}} The Ottomans finally conquered the [[Serbian Despotate]] in 1459. The Ottoman threat and eventual conquest saw massive migrations of Serbs to the west and north.{{sfn|Ćirković|2004|p=107-108}}

===Ottoman and Habsburg rule===
{{Main|Ottoman Serbia|Great Migrations of the Serbs}}
In all Serbian lands conquered by the Ottomans, the native nobility was eliminated and the peasantry was [[Serfdom|enserfed]] to Ottoman rulers, while much of the clergy fled or were confined to the isolated monasteries. Under the Ottoman system, Serbs, as well as Christians, were considered an [[rayah|inferior class]] of people and subjected to heavy taxes, and a portion of the Serbian population experienced [[Islamization]]. Many Serbs were recruited during the [[devshirme]] system,  a form of [[slavery in the Ottoman Empire]], in which boys from Balkan Christian families were [[Forced conversion|forcibly converted]] to [[Islam]] and trained for infantry units of the [[Military of the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman army]] known as the [[Janissaries]].{{sfn|A ́goston|Masters|2010|p=383}}{{sfn|Riley-Smith|2001|p=251}}{{sfn|Rodriguez|1997|p=6}}{{sfn|Kia|2011|p=62}} The [[Serbian Patriarchate of Peć]] was extinguished in 1463,{{sfn|Ćirković|2004|p=134}} but reestablished in 1557,{{sfn|Ćirković|2004|p=135-136}}{{sfn|Fotić|2008|p=519–520}}{{sfn|Sotirović|2011|p=143–169}} providing for limited continuation of Serbian cultural traditions within the Ottoman Empire, under the [[Millet system]].{{sfn|Runciman|1968|p=204}}{{sfn|Kia|2011|p=115}}

After the loss of statehood to the Ottoman Empire, Serbian resistance continued in northern regions (modern Vojvodina), under titular despots (until 1537), and popular leaders like [[Jovan Nenad]] (1526–1527). From 1521 to 1552, Ottomans conquered Belgrade and regions of Syrmia, Bačka, and Banat.{{sfn|Ćirković|2004|p=115, 119}} Continuing wars and various rebellions constantly challenged Ottoman rule. One of the most significant was the [[Banat Uprising]] in 1594 and 1595, which was part of the [[Long War (Ottoman wars)|Long War]] (1593–1606) between the Habsburgs and the Ottomans.{{sfn|Ćirković|2004|p=141–142}}{{sfn|Sotirović|2011|p=163–164}} The area of modern Vojvodina endured a century-long Ottoman occupation before being ceded to the [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg Empire]], partially by the [[Treaty of Karlovci]] (1699),{{sfn|Pešalj|2010|p=29-42}} and fully by the [[Treaty of Požarevac]] (1718).{{sfn|Ćirković|2004|p=151}}

[[File:Serbmigra.jpg|thumb|upright=1.0|left|The [[Great Migrations of the Serbs]], led by Patriarch [[Arsenije III Čarnojević]]]]

As the [[Great Serb Migrations]] depopulated most of southern Serbia, the Serbs sought refuge across the Danube River in [[Vojvodina]] to the north and the [[Military Frontier]] in the west, where they were granted rights by the Austrian crown under measures such as the ''Statuta Wallachorum'' of 1630. Much of central Serbia switched from Ottoman rule to [[Habsburg-occupied Serbia (1686–91)|Habsburg control (1686–91)]] during the [[Great Turkish War|Habsburg-Ottoman war (1683-1699)]]. Following several petitions, Emperor [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold I]] formally granted Serbs who wished to settle in the northern regions the right to their autonomous [[crown land]].{{sfn|Todorović|2006|p=7–8}} The ecclesiastical centre of the Serbs also moved northwards, to the [[Metropolitanate of Karlovci]],{{sfn|Ćirković|2004|p=150}} and the [[Serbian Patriarchate of Peć]] was once-again abolished by the Ottomans in 1766.{{sfn|Jelavich|1983a|p=94}}{{sfn|Ćirković|2004|p=177}} 

In 1718–39, the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] occupied much of [[Central Serbia]] and established the [[Kingdom of Serbia (1718–39)|Kingdom of Serbia]] as [[crownland]].{{sfn|Ćirković|2004|p=151}} Those gains were lost by the [[Treaty of Belgrade]] in 1739, when the Ottomans retook the region.{{sfn|Ćirković|2004|p=176}} Apart from territory of modern Vojvodina which remained under the Habsburg Empire, central regions of Serbia were occupied once again by the Habsburgs in [[Habsburg-occupied Serbia (1788–92)|1788–1792]].

===Revolution and independence===
{{Main|Serbian Revolution|Principality of Serbia|Kingdom of Serbia}}
The [[Serbian Revolution]] for independence from the Ottoman Empire lasted eleven years, from 1804 until 1815.{{sfn|Jelavich|1983a|p=193-204}}{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2002|p=29-32}}{{sfn|Radosavljević|2010|p=171-178}}{{sfn|Rajić|2010|p=143-148}} The revolution comprised two separate uprisings which gained autonomy from the Ottoman Empire (1830) that eventually evolved towards full independence (1878). During the [[First Serbian Uprising]] (1804–1813), led by vožd [[Karađorđe Petrović]], Serbia was independent for almost a decade before the Ottoman army was able to reoccupy the country.{{sfn|Ćirković|2004|p=179-183}} Shortly after this, the [[Second Serbian Uprising]] began in 1815. Led by [[Miloš Obrenović]], it ended with a compromise between Serbian revolutionaries and Ottoman authorities.{{sfn|Ćirković|2004|p=190-196}} Likewise, Serbia was one of the first nations in the Balkans to abolish [[feudalism]].{{sfn|Ćirković|2004|p=191}} The [[Akkerman Convention]] in 1826, the [[Treaty of Adrianople (1829)|Treaty of Adrianople]] in 1829 and finally, the [[Hatt-i Sharif]], recognised the [[suzerainty]] of Serbia. The [[Sretenje Constitution|First Serbian Constitution]] was adopted on 15 February 1835 (the anniversary of the outbreak of the First Serbian Uprising), making the country one of the first to adopt a democratic constitution in Europe.{{sfn|Stavrianos|2000|p=248–250}}{{sfn|Ćirković|2004|p=195}} 15 February is now commemorated as [[Statehood Day (Serbia)|Statehood Day]], a [[Public holidays in Serbia|public holiday]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://fim.edu.rs/en/statehood-day-of-the-republic-of-serbia-2019/ |title=Statehood Day of the Republic of Serbia 2019 |website=School of Engineering Management (Belgrade) |access-date=2020-02-12 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>

Following the clashes between the Ottoman army and Serbs in Belgrade in 1862,{{sfn|Ćirković|2004|p=214-215}} and under pressure from the [[Great Powers]], by 1867 the last Turkish soldiers left the Principality, making the country ''de facto'' independent.{{sfn|Jelavich|1983a|p=246}} By enacting a new constitution in 1869,{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2002|p=58}} without consulting the Porte, [[Jovan Ristic|Serbian diplomats]] confirmed the ''de facto'' independence of the country. In 1876, Serbia declared war on the Ottoman Empire, siding with the ongoing Christian uprisings in [[Uprising in Bosnia and Herzegovina (1875-1878)|Bosnia-Herzegovina]] and [[Bulgarian Uprising of 1876|Bulgaria]].{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2002|p=63-64}}{{sfn|Ćirković|2004|p=224}}

The formal independence of the country was internationally recognised at the [[Congress of Berlin]] in 1878, which ended the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878)|Russo-Turkish War]]; this treaty, however, prohibited Serbia from uniting with other Serbian regions by placing Bosnia and Herzegovina under [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] occupation, alongside the occupation of the region of [[Raška (region)|Raška]].{{sfn|Ćirković|2004|p=225}} From 1815 to 1903, the Principality of Serbia was ruled by the [[House of Obrenović]], save for the rule of Prince [[Alexander Karađorđević, Prince of Serbia|Aleksandar Karađorđević]] between 1842 and 1858. In 1882, Principality of Serbia became the [[Kingdom of Serbia]], ruled by [[Milan I of Serbia|King Milan I]].{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2002|p=70}} The [[House of Karađorđević]], descendants of the revolutionary leader Karađorđe Petrović, assumed power in 1903 following the [[May Overthrow]].{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2002|p=73}} 
In the north, the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the Habsburg areas|1848 revolution in Austria]] led to the establishment of the autonomous territory of [[Serbian Vojvodina]]; by 1849, the region was transformed into the [[Voivodeship of Serbia and Banat of Temeschwar]].{{sfn|Ćirković|2004|p=203}}

===The Balkan Wars and World War I===
{{Main|Balkan Wars|Serbian Campaign of World War I|}}
In the course of the [[First Balkan War]] in 1912, the [[Balkan League]] defeated the [[Ottoman Empire]] and captured its [[Treaty of London, 1913|European territories]], which enabled territorial expansion of the Kingdom of Serbia into regions of [[Raška (region)|Raška]], [[Kosovo (region)|Kosovo]], [[Metohija]], and [[Vardarian Macedonia]]. The [[Second Balkan War]] soon ensued when Bulgaria turned on its former allies, but was defeated, resulting in the [[Treaty of Bucharest (1913)|Treaty of Bucharest]]. In two years, Serbia enlarged its territory and its population by 50%;{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} it also suffered high casualties on the eve of World War I, with more than 36,000 dead.{{sfn|Hall|2000|p=135}} Austria-Hungary became wary of the rising regional power on its borders and its potential to become an anchor for unification of Serbs and other South Slavs, and the relationship between the two countries became tense.

The [[Assassination in Sarajevo|assassination]] of [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria]] on 28 June 1914 in [[Sarajevo]] by [[Gavrilo Princip]], a member of the [[Young Bosnia]] organisation, led to Austria-Hungary declaring war on Serbia, on 28 July.{{sfn|Ćirković|2004|p=246-247}} Local war escalated when [[German Empire|Germany]] declared war on [[Russian Empire|Russia]] and invaded [[French Third Republic|France]] and [[Belgium]], thus drawing [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Great Britain]] into the conflict that became the [[First World War]]. Serbia won the first major battles of World War I, including the [[Battle of Cer]],{{sfn|Mitrović|2007|p=69}} and the [[Battle of Kolubara]], marking the first [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] victories against the [[Central Powers]] in World War I.{{sfn|Mitrović|2007|p=104}}

King Peter was succeeded by his son, Alexander, in August 1921. Serb centralists and Croat autonomists clashed in the parliament, and most governments were fragile and short-lived. [[Nikola Pašić]], a conservative prime minister, headed or dominated most governments until his death. King Alexander established a [[6 January Dictatorship|dictatorship]] in 1929 with the aim of establishing the [[Yugoslavism|Yugoslav ideology]] and single [[Yugoslavs|Yugoslav nation]], changed the name of the country to Yugoslavia and changed the internal divisions from the 33 [[oblasts]] to nine new [[Subdivisions of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia|banovinas]]. The effect of Alexander's dictatorship was to further alienate the non-Serbs living in Yugoslavia from the idea of unity.{{sfn|Stavrianos|2000|p=624}}

Alexander was assassinated in [[Marseille]], during an official visit in 1934 by [[Vlado Chernozemski]], member of the [[Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization|IMRO]]. Alexander was succeeded by his eleven-year-old son [[Peter II of Yugoslavia|Peter II]] and a regency council was headed by his cousin, [[Prince Paul of Yugoslavia|Prince Paul]]. In August 1939 the [[Cvetković–Maček Agreement]] established an autonomous [[Banate of Croatia]] as a solution to Croatian concerns.

In 1941, in spite of Yugoslav attempts to remain neutral in the war, the [[Axis powers]] invaded Yugoslavia. The territory of modern Serbia was divided between Hungary, Bulgaria, the Independent State of Croatia and Italy (Greater Albania and Montenegro), while the remaining part of the occupied Serbia was placed under the [[Territory of the Military Commander in Serbia|military administration]] of the [[Nazi Germany]], with [[Government of National Salvation|Serbian puppet governments]] led by [[Milan Aćimović]] and [[Milan Nedić]] assisted by [[Dimitrije Ljotić]]'s fascist organization [[Yugoslav National Movement]] (Zbor).

The Yugoslav territory was the scene of a civil war between [[Chetniks|royalist Chetniks]] commanded by [[Draža Mihailović]] and [[Partisans (Yugoslavia)|communist partisans]] commanded by [[Josip Broz Tito]]. Axis auxiliary units of the [[Serbian Volunteer Corps (World War II)|Serbian Volunteer Corps]] and the [[Serbian State Guard]] fought against both of these forces. [[Siege of Kraljevo]] was a major battle of the [[Uprising in Serbia (1941)|Uprising in Serbia]], led by Chetnik forces against the Nazis. Several days after the battle began the German forces committed a massacre of approximately 2,000 civilians in an event known as the [[Kraljevo massacre]], in a reprisal for the attack.

The victory of the Communist Partisans resulted in the abolition of the monarchy and a subsequent constitutional referendum.

Serbia's most powerful and influential politician in Tito-era Yugoslavia was [[Aleksandar Ranković]], one of the "big four" Yugoslav leaders, alongside Tito, [[Edvard Kardelj]], and [[Milovan Đilas]]. Ranković was later removed from the office because of the disagreements regarding Kosovo's [[nomenklatura]] and the unity of Serbia. Ranković's dismissal was highly unpopular among Serbs. Pro-decentralisation reformers in Yugoslavia succeeded in the late 1960s in attaining substantial decentralisation of powers, creating substantial autonomy in Kosovo and Vojvodina, and recognising a distinctive "[[Muslims (ethnicity)|Muslim]]" nationality. As a result of these reforms, there was a massive overhaul of Kosovo's nomenklatura and police, that shifted from being Serb-dominated to ethnic Albanian-dominated through firing Serbs on a large scale. Further concessions were made to the ethnic Albanians of Kosovo in response to unrest, including the creation of the [[University of Pristina (1969–1999)|University of Pristina]] as an [[Albanian language]] institution. These changes created widespread fear among Serbs of being treated as [[second-class citizen]]s.<ref>{{cite book |first1=Melissa Katherine |last1=Bokovoy |first2=Jill A. |last2=Irvine |first3=Carol S. |last3=Lilly |title=State-society relations in Yugoslavia, 1945–1992 |location=Scranton, Pennsylvania |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |year=1997 |pages=295–296, 301}}</ref>

In 1989, [[Slobodan Milošević]] rose to power in Serbia. Milošević promised a reduction of powers for the autonomous provinces of Kosovo and Vojvodina, where his allies subsequently took over power, during the [[Anti-bureaucratic revolution]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d5np99Vgc0YC&q=anti-bureaucratic+revolution&pg=PA165|title=The Destruction of Yugoslavia: tracking the break-up 1980–92 (pp 165–170)|first=Branka|last=Magaš|year=1993|publisher=Verso|isbn=978-0-86091-593-5}}</ref> This ignited tensions between the communist leadership of the other republics of [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], and awoke ethnic nationalism across Yugoslavia that eventually resulted in its [[Breakup of Yugoslavia|breakup]], with [[Slovenia]], [[Croatia]], [[Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia and Herzegovina]], and [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]] declaring independence during 1991 and 1992.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/01/16/world/breakup-of-yugoslavia-leaves-slovenia-secure-croatia-shaky.html|work=The New York Times|title=Breakup of Yugoslavia Leaves Slovenia Secure, Croatia Shaky|first=Stephen|last=Engelberg|date=16 January 1992|access-date=6 April 2010}}</ref>{{better source|date=March 2017}} Serbia and Montenegro remained together as the [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] (FRY).<ref name=SCGSuccession /> However, according to the [[Arbitration Commission of the Peace Conference on Yugoslavia|Badinter Commission]], the country was not legally considered a continuation of the former SFRY, but a new state.

Fueled by ethnic tensions, the [[Yugoslav Wars]] (1991–2001) erupted, with the most severe conflicts taking place in [[War in Croatia|Croatia]] and [[Bosnian War|Bosnia]], where the large ethnic Serb communities opposed independence from Yugoslavia. The FRY remained outside the conflicts, but provided logistic, military and financial support to Serb forces in the wars. In response, the UN imposed [[sanctions against Serbia]] which led to political isolation and the collapse of the economy (GDP decreased from $24 billion in 1990 to under $10 billion in 1993). Following the rise of nationalism and political tensions after Slobodan Milošević came to power, numerous [[anti-war movement]]s developed in Serbia and many [[1991–1992 anti-war protests in Belgrade|anti-war protests]] were held in Belgrade.<ref>{{cite book|title=Burn This House: The Making and Unmaking of Yugoslavia |first1=Jasminka |last1=Udovicki|first2=James|last2=Ridgeway|publisher=[[Duke University Press]]|year=2000|isbn=978-1-136-76482-0|location=Durham, North Carolina|pages=255–266}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Fridman |first1=Orli |title='It was like fighting a war with our own people': anti-war activism in Serbia during the 1990s |journal=The Journal of Nationalism and Ethnicity |year=2010|volume=39|issue=4|pages=507–522 |doi=10.1080/00905992.2011.579953|s2cid=153467930}}</ref>
Multi-party democracy was introduced in Serbia in 1990, officially dismantling the one-party system. Critics of Milošević stated that the government continued to be authoritarian despite constitutional changes, as Milošević maintained strong political influence over the state media and security apparatus.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hague.bard.edu/reports/de_la_brosse_pt1.pdf|title=Political Propaganda and the Plan to Create a "State for all Serbs" |access-date=14 November 2010}}</ref><ref>''Wide Angle, Milosevic and the Media.''

After [[2000 Yugoslavian general election|presidential elections]] in September 2000, opposition parties accused Milošević of [[electoral fraud]].

In 2011, [[Roman Catholicism in Serbia|Roman Catholics]] numbered 356,957 in Serbia, or roughly 6% of the population, mostly in northern Vojvodina which is home to ethnic minority groups such as Hungarians, Croats, and [[Bunjevci]], as well as to some Slovaks and Czechs.<ref name="popis2011.stat.rs">{{cite web |url=http://popis2011.stat.rs/?page_id=1221 |title=Становништво, домаћинства и породице – база : Попис у Србији 2011 |publisher=Popis2011.stat.rs }}</ref>

[[Protestantism]] accounts for about 1% of the country's population, chiefly [[Lutheranism]] among [[Slovaks in Vojvodina]] as well as [[Calvinism]] among [[Hungarian Reformed Church|Reformed Hungarians]].

The energy sector is one of the largest and most important sectors to the country's economy. Serbia is a net exporter of electricity and importer of key fuels (such as oil and gas).

Serbia has an abundance of coal, and significant reserves of oil and gas. Serbia's proven reserves of 5.5 billion tonnes of [[lignite|coal lignite]] are the 5th largest in the world (second in Europe, after Germany).<ref name="b92.net">{{cite web|url=http://www.b92.net/biz/vesti/srbija.php?yyyy=2011&mm=04&dd=19&nav_id=507192 |title=Biz – Vesti – Srbija ima uglja za još jedan vek |publisher=B92 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.worldenergy.org/documents/ser_2010_report_1.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=20 August 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130824071141/http://www.worldenergy.org/documents/ser_2010_report_1.pdf |archive-date=24 August 2013  }}</ref> Coal is found in two large deposits: [[RB Kolubara|Kolubara]] (4 billion tonnes of reserves) and [[Kostolac coal mine|Kostolac]] (1.5 billion tonnes).<ref name="b92.net"/> Despite being small on a world scale, Serbia's oil and gas resources (77.4 million tonnes of oil equivalent and 48.1 billion cubic metres, respectively) have a certain regional importance since they are largest in the region of former Yugoslavia as well as the Balkans (excluding Romania).<ref>[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2179rank.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130309174844/https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2179rank.html |date=9 March 2013 }}</ref> Almost 90% of the discovered oil and gas are to be found in [[Banat]] and those oil and gas fields are by size among the largest in the Pannonian basin but are average on a European scale.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ogj.com/1/vol-110/issue-1a/exploration-development/exploration-production-full.html |title=Exploration, production pace faster in Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina – Oil & Gas Journal |publisher=Ogj.com }}</ref>

For centuries straddling the boundaries between East and West, the territory of Serbia had been divided among the Eastern and [[Western Roman Empire|Western]] halves of the [[Roman Empire]]; then between [[Byzantium]] and the Kingdom of Hungary; and in the Early modern period between the [[Ottoman Empire]] and the [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg Empire]]. These overlapping influences have resulted in cultural varieties throughout Serbia; its north leans to the profile of Central Europe, while the south is characteristic of the wider Balkans and even the Mediterranean. The Byzantine influence on Serbia was profound, firstly through the introduction of [[Eastern Christianity]] in the Early Middle Ages. The Serbian Orthodox Church has had an enduring status in Serbia, with the [[List of Serb Orthodox monasteries|many Serbian monasteries]] constituting cultural monuments left from [[Serbia in the Middle Ages]]. Serbia has seen influences of [[Republic of Venice]] as well, mainly though trade, literature and [[Romanesque art|romanesque architecture]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ML-aXrrBrv8C&q=Venetian+influences+on+Serbian+culture&pg=PA1616|title=World and Its Peoples|date=2010|publisher=Marshall Cavendish|isbn=978-0-7614-7903-1|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |last=Mihajlović |first=Radmila |date=2018|title=Following the traces of Serbs through Northern Italy |journal=Basis of Cultural Tourism Development|location=Rome|pages=37–39}}</ref>

Serbia has five cultural monuments inscribed in the list of [[World Heritage Site|UNESCO World Heritage]]: the early medieval capital [[Stari Ras]] and the 13th-century monastery [[Sopoćani]]; the 12th-century [[Studenica monastery]]; the Roman complex of [[Gamzigrad|Gamzigrad–Felix Romuliana]]; medieval tombstones [[Stećci]]; and finally the endangered [[Medieval Monuments in Kosovo]] (the monasteries of [[Visoki Dečani]], [[Our Lady of Ljeviš]], [[Gračanica Monastery|Gračanica]] and [[Patriarchal Monastery of Peć]]).{{sfn|Čanak-Medić|Todić|2017|p=}}

There are two literary monuments on UNESCO's [[Memory of the World Programme]]: the 12th-century ''[[Miroslav Gospel]]'', and scientist [[Nikola Tesla]]'s archive. The ''[[slava]]'' (patron saint veneration), [[kolo (dance)|kolo]] (traditional folk dance) and singing to the accompaniment of the [[gusle]] are inscribed on [[UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists]]. The [[Minister of Culture (Serbia)|Ministry of Culture and Information]] is tasked with preserving the nation's [[Cultural Heritage of Serbia|cultural heritage]] and overseeing its development. Further activities supporting development of culture are undertaken at local government level.

Serbian monasteries are the pinnacle of Serbian medieval art. At the beginning, they were under the influence of [[Byzantine Art]] which was particularly felt after the fall of Constantinople in 1204, when many Byzantine artists fled to Serbia.{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}} Noted of these monasteries is [[Studenica monastery|Studenica]] (built around 1190). It was a model for later monasteries, like the [[Mileševa]], [[Sopoćani]], [[Žiča]], [[Gračanica monastery|Gračanica]] and [[Visoki Dečani]]. Numerous monuments and cultural sites were destroyed at various stages of Serbian history, with [[Destruction of Serbian heritage in Kosovo|destruuction in Kosovo]] being the recent example. In the end of 14th and the 15th centuries, autochthonous architectural style known as [[Morava architectural school|Morava style]] evolved in area around Morava Valley. A characteristic of this style was the wealthy decoration of the frontal church walls. Examples of this include [[Manasija]], [[Ravanica]] and [[Kalenić Monastery|Kalenić]] monasteries. 

Icons and fresco paintings are often considered the peak of Serbian art. The most famous frescos are [[White Angel]] (Mileševa monastery), ''Crucifixion'' (Studenica monastery) and ''Dormition of the Virgin'' (Sopoćani).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://afrodita.rcub.bg.ac.rs/~todorom/tutorials/rad43.html|title=Spirituality and Materiality on Serbian Frescoes |website=afrodita.rcub.bg.ac.rs|access-date=2019-04-28}}</ref>

During the time of Ottoman occupation, Serbian art was virtually non-existent, with the exception of several Serbian artists who lived in the lands ruled by the [[Habsburg Monarchy]].

[[Balkan Brass Band|Balkan Brass]], or ''truba'' ("trumpet") is a popular genre, especially in Central and Southern Serbia where Balkan Brass originated. The music has its tradition from the [[First Serbian Uprising]]. The trumpet was used as a military instrument to wake and gather soldiers and announce battles, the trumpet took on the role of entertainment during downtime, as soldiers used it to transpose popular folk songs. When the war ended and the soldiers returned to the rural life, the music entered civilian life and eventually became a music style, accompanying births, baptisms, weddings, and funerals. There are two main varieties of this genre, one from Western Serbia and the other from Southern Serbia, with brass musician [[Boban Marković]] being one of the most respected names in the world of modern brass band bandleaders.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.panacomp.net/boban-and-marko-markovic-brass-band/|title=Boban and Marko Marković Brass Band -|date=2016-01-25|access-date=2019-04-27}}</ref>

{{Main|Serbian cuisine}}
[[File:Serbian Christmas meal.jpg|thumb|upright=1.0|Typical Christmas table in Serbia with roasted [[pork]], [[Russian salad]] and [[Serbian wine|wine]]]]

Serbian cuisine is largely heterogeneous in a way characteristic of the Balkans and, especially, the [[former Yugoslavia]]. It features foods characteristic of lands formerly under [[Turkish cuisine|Turkish]] suzerainty as well as cuisine originating from other parts of [[Central Europe]] (especially [[Austrian cuisine|Austria]] and [[Hungarian cuisine|Hungary]]). Food is very important in Serbian social life, particularly during religious holidays such as [[Christmas]], [[Easter]] and feast days i.e. [[slava]].{{sfn|Meynink|2011|p=330}}

Staples of the Serbian diet include bread, meat, fruits, vegetables, and dairy products. Bread is the basis of all Serbian meals, and it plays an important role in Serbian cuisine and can be found in religious rituals. A traditional Serbian welcome is to offer bread and [[salt]] to guests. Meat is widely consumed, as is fish. Serbian specialties include [[ćevapčići]] (caseless sausages made of minced meat, which is always grilled and seasoned), [[pljeskavica]], [[sarma (food)|sarma]], [[kajmak]] (a dairy product similar to [[clotted cream]]), [[gibanica]] (cheese and kajmak pie), [[ajvar]] (a roasted red pepper spread), [[proja]] (cornbread), and [[kačamak]] (corn-flour porridge).{{sfn|Meynink|2011|p=329–330}}

Serbians claim their country as the birthplace of [[rakia]] (''rakija''), a highly alcoholic drink primarily distilled from fruit. Rakia in various forms is found throughout the Balkans, notably in Bulgaria, Croatia, Slovenia, Montenegro, Hungary and Turkey. [[Slivovitz]] (''šljivovica''), a plum brandy, is a type of rakia which is considered the national drink of Serbia.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.serbia.travel/about-serbia/typically-serbian/food/ |title=Food |publisher=serbia.travel |access-date=20 March 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130420144616/https://www.serbia.travel/about-serbia/typically-serbian/food/ |archive-date=20 April 2013  }}</ref>
