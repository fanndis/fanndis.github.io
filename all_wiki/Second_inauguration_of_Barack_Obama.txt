The '''second inauguration of Barack Obama''' as [[President of the United States]] was the 57th [[United States presidential inauguration|inauguration]] and marked the commencement of the second and final term of [[Barack Obama]] as President and [[Joe Biden]] as [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]]. A private swearing-in ceremony took place on Sunday, January 20, 2013, in the [[Blue Room (White House)|Blue Room]] of the [[White House]]. A public inauguration ceremony took place on Monday, January 21, 2013, at the West Front of the [[United States Capitol]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.inaugural.senate.gov/about/past-inaugural-ceremonies/fifty-seventh-inaugural-ceremonies/|title=The 57th Presidential Inauguration: Barack H.

The inauguration theme was "Faith in America's Future", a phrase that draws upon the 150th anniversary of [[Abraham Lincoln]]'s [[Emancipation Proclamation]] and the completion of the [[United States Capitol dome|Capitol dome]] in 1863. The theme also stressed the "perseverance and unity" of the United States and echoed the "Forward" theme used in the closing months of [[Barack Obama presidential campaign, 2012|Obama's reelection campaign]]. The inaugural events held in Washington,&nbsp;D.C. from January 19 to 21, 2013 included concerts, a national day of community service on [[Martin Luther King, Jr. Day|Martin&nbsp;Luther King,&nbsp;Jr. Day]], the swearing-in ceremony, luncheon and parade, inaugural balls, and the interfaith [[Prayers at United States presidential inaugurations|inaugural prayer service]]. The [[Oath of office of the President of the United States|presidential oath]] was administered to Obama during his swearing-in ceremony on January 20 and 21, 2013 by [[Chief Justice of the United States]] [[John Roberts|John G. Roberts]].

In his second inauguration address, Obama proclaimed that "while freedom is a gift from God, it must be secured by His people here on Earth". He called for laws to [[Climate change mitigation|combat]] [[Climate change in the United States|climate change]], [[History of laws concerning immigration and naturalization in the United States|enactment]] of [[Immigration to the United States|immigration]] [[immigration reform|reform]] and [[Gun politics in the United States|gun control]]. Obama stated that more progress was needed on human rights and civil rights (including [[Minority rights|racial minority rights]], [[women's rights]], and [[LGBT rights]]). He vowed to promote democracy abroad and stated that the United States must "be a source of hope to the poor, the sick, the marginalized, the victims of prejudice" around the world. Additionally, the president vowed to keep existing alliances strong, emphasized the economic recovery and the end of wars, and stated that "no one has a greater stake in a peaceful world than its most powerful nation". During the speech, Obama linked the [[Seneca Falls Convention]], [[Selma to Montgomery marches]] and [[Stonewall riots]].

Approximately one million people attended the inauguration, and millions more watched from around the world.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://tv.msnbc.com/2013/01/22/by-the-numbers-more-than-1-million-attend-obamas-second-inauguration/|title=By the numbers: More than 1 million attend Obama's second inauguration|date=22 January 2013|accessdate=22 February 2013|newspaper=MSNBC News|archive-date=July 30, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180730080411/http://www.msnbc.com/hardball/the-numbers-more-1-million-attend-ob|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Official swearing-in ceremonies===
[[File:President Obama takes the Oath of Office (HD).ogv|thumb|President Barack Obama being sworn in by the Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court John Roberts, and accompanied by his family in an official, private ceremony at the White House.]]
Since 1937, the 4-year term of the President and Vice President have ended and begun at noon on January 20, as prescribed by the [[Twentieth Amendment to the United States Constitution]]. Because January 20, 2013, fell on a Sunday, both Obama and Biden were officially sworn in privately, and then again the following day in a public ceremony. This was the seventh time since the start of [[James Monroe]]'s second term in office, in 1821, that the oath of office was officially administered in a Sunday private ceremony.<ref>{{cite web|title=Why is the 2013 Inaugural Ceremonies on January 21?|url=http://www.inaugural.senate.gov/docs/doc-011713-press-guide.pdf|work=The 57th Presidential Inaugural Ceremonies: Guide for producers and correspondents to the inaugural ceremonies and Capitol Hill events|publisher=Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies.|pages=22–23|accessdate=2013-08-12|archive-date=May 2, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502122019/http://www.inaugural.senate.gov/docs/doc-011713-press-guide.pdf|url-status=live}}</ref> Chief Justice [[John Roberts]] administered the oath of office to the President on January 20 in the [[Blue Room (White House)|Blue Room]] at the White House.

Barack Obama used the opening words of the [[U.S. Constitution]]'s preamble, "[[Preamble to the United States Constitution|We, the people]]", to suggest how to reconcile America's founding truths and the current discord and dysfunction of its embittered political system.<ref name="APTA20130122" /> He also referenced America's Declaration of Independence stating that our inalienable rights, such as [[Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness]], may be self-evident, but never have been self-executing.<ref name="WPSWilson20130121" /> Obama again invoked the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] by telling his audience: "What makes us exceptional, what makes us America, is our allegiance to an idea articulated in a declaration made more than two centuries ago: We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal."<ref name="WPFahrenthold20130122">{{cite news|last=Fahrenthold|first=David A.|title=President Obama takes second oath of office at inauguration|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/president-obama-takes-second-oath-of-office-at-inauguration/2013/01/21/062d9d54-63d4-11e2-85f5-a8a9228e55e7_story.html|accessdate=January 22, 2013|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=January 22, 2013|archive-date=January 22, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130122231916/http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/president-obama-takes-second-oath-of-office-at-inauguration/2013/01/21/062d9d54-63d4-11e2-85f5-a8a9228e55e7_story.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

Obama went on, saying "[[All men are created equal|all of us are created equal]]" and that the shared equality of the American people guided the United States "through Seneca Falls and Selma and Stonewall"—linking the [[Seneca Falls Convention]], [[Selma to Montgomery marches]] and [[Stonewall riots]] as key moments in [[women's rights|women's rights activism]], the [[civil rights movement]], and the  [[LGBT rights in the United States|LGBT rights movement]] in the United States together.<ref name="NYTBaker20130121" /><ref name="WPSWilson20130121" /><ref name="Obama Sketches a Firmly Progressive Agenda">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/22/us/politics/obama-inauguration-draws-hundreds-of-thousands.html?_r=0|title=Obama Sketches a Firmly Progressive Agenda|last=Shear|first=Michael D.|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=January 22, 2013|date=January 21, 2013|archive-date=January 26, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130126064305/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/22/us/politics/obama-inauguration-draws-hundreds-of-thousands.html?_r=0|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="WPKTumulty20130121" /><ref name="CNNBasu20130121">{{cite news|last=Basu|first=Monica|title=Obama embraces key social justice movements in inaugural address|url=http://inamerica.blogs.cnn.com/2013/01/21/obama-embraces-key-social-justice-movements-in-inaugural-address/|publisher=CNN|accessdate=January 24, 2013|date=January 21, 2012|archive-date=January 24, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130124020350/http://inamerica.blogs.cnn.com/2013/01/21/obama-embraces-key-social-justice-movements-in-inaugural-address/|url-status=live}}</ref>

Additional words indicated a commitment to [[LGBT rights in the United States|LGBT rights]]: "Our journey is not complete until our gay brothers and sisters are treated like anyone else under the law—for if we are truly created equal, then surely the love we commit to one another must be equal as well."

Obama commented on the role of government that "Progress does not compel us to settle centuries-long debates about the role of government for all time — but it does require us to act in our time."<ref name="WPLRein20130121" /> And he added while the American people never gave up their skepticism of a strong federal government, they also never believed that the government can fix all ills.<ref name="WPLRein20130121">{{cite news|last=Rein|first=Lisa|title=The inaugural speech and the role of government|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2013/01/21/the-inaugural-speech-and-the-role-of-government/|accessdate=January 22, 2013|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=January 21, 2013|archive-date=August 19, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200819180236/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/federal-eye/wp/2013/01/21/the-inaugural-speech-and-the-role-of-government/?arc404=true|url-status=live}}</ref> In order to prepare America for a rapidly changing world he stressed the need for the political leaders of America to act in common cause.

While praising U.S. Armed Forces members for their bravery and strength, Obama asserted that "enduring security and lasting peace do not require perpetual war."<ref name="NYTStevenson20130121" /> This statement was made in the foreign policy section of his inaugural address in which Obama promised diplomacy of engagement backed with military steel, but he did not dwell on specific crises like [[Nuclear program of Iran|Iran]].<ref name="APTA20130122">{{cite news|title=Barack Obama sworn in as President in public inauguration|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/barack-obama-to-be-sworn-in-as-president-in-public-inauguration-speech/story-e6frg6n6-1226558549986|agency=Associated Press|publisher=The Australian|accessdate=January 23, 2013|date=January 22, 2012|archive-date=January 22, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130122030244/http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/barack-obama-to-be-sworn-in-as-president-in-public-inauguration-speech/story-e6frg6n6-1226558549986|url-status=live}}</ref> "We will show the courage to try and resolve our differences with other nations peacefully - not because we are naive about the dangers we face, but because engagement can more durably lift suspicion and fear."<ref name="APTA20130122" /> He also declared the United States "must be a source of hope for the poor, the sick, the marginalized, the victims of prejudice ..." and stand for "human dignity and justice."<ref name="CNNGhitis20130122">{{cite news|last=Ghitis|first=Frida|title=World to Obama: You can't ignore us|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2013/01/22/opinion/ghitis-obama-world/index.html|publisher=CNN|accessdate=January 24, 2013|date=January 22, 2013|archive-date=January 23, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130123190332/http://edition.cnn.com/2013/01/22/opinion/ghitis-obama-world/index.html|url-status=live}}</ref> Barack Obama also challenged those who favor aggressive use of the powerful U.S. military, calling them to remember the policies of presidents past.

He referenced the country's [[American Civil War|civil war]] experience and [[Slavery in the United States|its slavery history]] with allusions to phrases used by Abraham Lincoln: "Through blood drawn by lash and blood drawn by sword, we learned that no union founded on the principles of liberty and equality could survive [[Lincoln's House Divided Speech|half-slave and half-free]]."<ref name="Schlesinger20130123"/> This was an allusion to "until every drop of blood drawn with the lash shall be paid by another drawn with the sword" from Abraham Lincoln's [[Abraham Lincoln's second inaugural address|second inauguration address]].<ref name="Schlesinger20130123" /> The [[inaugural address of John F. Kennedy]] was also referenced. Obama's "this generation of Americans has been tested by crises that steeled our resolve and proved our resilience" and later description of "brave men and women in uniform, tempered by the flames of battle" was an allusion to Kennedy's line of a "new generation of Americans—born in this century, tempered by war, disciplined by a hard and bitter peace."<ref name="Schlesinger20130123" /> Obama's assertion that America is willing to negotiate with its adversaries "not because we are naïve about the dangers we face, but because engagement can more durably lift suspicion and fear" was reminiscent of Kennedy's words that "civility is not a sign of weakness ... Let us never negotiate out of fear. But let us never fear to negotiate."<ref name="Schlesinger20130123" />

Barack Obama described the American state of affairs with references to the wars in [[w:War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Afghanistan]] and [[w:Iraq War|Iraq]] as well as the [[2007–2009 recession in the United States]] as follows: "This generation of Americans has been tested by crises that steeled our resolve and proved our resilience. A decade of war is now ending. An economic recovery has begun. America's possibilities are limitless."<ref name="BBC20130122" /> Obama then added a collective call to action: "My fellow Americans, we are made for this moment, and we will seize it - so long as we seize it together."<ref name="BBC20130122" /> Noting that "Decisions are upon us, and we cannot afford delay" Obama stressed the need of shielding the weak, the poor and those lacking health care and demanded equality for all races and gay rights, and [[Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting|security from gun crime for children]].<ref name="APTA20130122" /> In the ''[[Washington Post]]'', [[Chris Cillizza]] stated in this context that Obama's overall inaugural message was "That we are all in this together and that we will ultimately be judged by how we treat the lowest among us." Cillizza pointed to five sentences of Obama's speech which contained not only Obama's agenda for his second term but also "outlined what he wanted his second term to be—and to mean":<ref name="WPCillizza20130121">{{cite news|last=Cillizza|first=Chris|title=The most important paragraph of President Obama's second inaugural address|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2013/01/21/the-most-important-paragraph-of-president-obamas-second-inaugural-address/|accessdate=January 22, 2013|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=January 21, 2013|archive-date=January 23, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130123134645/http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2013/01/21/the-most-important-paragraph-of-president-obamas-second-inaugural-address/|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Post-ceremony traditions===
At the conclusion of his inaugural address, Obama walked back into the Capitol building, then turned for a moment to look out at the [[National Mall]], filled with hundreds of thousands of flag-waving Americans. He said to those close to him: "I want to take a look one more time. I'm not going to see this again."<ref>{{cite news|last1=Smith|first1=Matt|last2=Cohen|first2=Tom|title=Sworn in again, Obama lingers for last look|url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/01/21/politics/obama-inauguration/index.html|accessdate=January 24, 2013|newspaper=CNN|date=January 20, 2013|archive-date=January 23, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130123222518/http://www.cnn.com/2013/01/21/politics/obama-inauguration/index.html|url-status=live}}</ref> Shortly afterward, he signed the Capitol's guest book.

Then, in the President's Room of the U.S. Capitol, with the bipartisan congressional leadership looking on, Obama signed documents submitting the nominations of his nominees for several Cabinet posts, the secretaries of State, Defense and Treasury and the head of the CIA.<ref name="LATimes20130121" />

Obama then dined on bison and lobster with select members of Congress and guests in the Capitol's [[National Statuary Hall]] before returning to the White House in the inaugural parade.<ref name="APTA20130122" />

====Parade====

The inaugural parade route ran along [[Pennsylvania Avenue (Washington, D.C.)|Pennsylvania Avenue]],&nbsp;[[Northwest, Washington, D.C.|N.W.]] from the U.S.&nbsp;Capitol, ending at the north face of the White House. During most of the parade, President Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama traveled in the armored [[Presidential State Car (United States)|limousine]].

====Inaugural balls====

In a departure from the number of evening balls for the first Obama inauguration, only two official inaugural balls were held to on January 21 celebrate the second inauguration. President Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama attended the Commander-In-Chief's Ball held for members of the U.S. military and attended the Inaugural Ball, an invitation-only public gala held as a unified celebration for all Americans. Both inaugural balls were held on January 21 at the Walter E.

On January 22, a private staff-only inaugural ball was held for White House aides and administration staff, [[Barack Obama presidential campaign, 2012|Obama for America]] campaign staff, and the Inaugural Committee staff, was held at the Walter E. Washington Convention Center, a tradition started by the President and First Lady during the 2009 inauguration to express thanks for the work of the staff.

President Obama and the First Lady Michelle Obama led the group in the chant, "fired up, ready to go" that was carried over from the 2008 and 2012 election campaigns. President Obama expressed gratitude and honored the aides and campaign staff for their work, telling the group that "'it makes [him] know that America's future is in good hands' ... 'as long as all of you understand the immense and incredible power that you possess when you work together, when you join voices.'"<ref name=staffball/><ref>{{cite web|last=Estes|first=Adam Clark|title=Obama's staff-only inaugural ball sounds like the best inaugural ball|url=http://www.theatlanticwire.com/politics/2013/01/obamas-staff-only-inaugural-ball-sounds-best-inaugural-ball/61301/|work=[[The Atlantic#The Atlantic Wire|The Atlantic Wire]]|publisher=22 January 2013|accessdate=16 August 2013|archive-date=June 6, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130606100730/http://www.theatlanticwire.com/politics/2013/01/obamas-staff-only-inaugural-ball-sounds-best-inaugural-ball/61301/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=NBC5Chicago>{{cite web|last=Lutz|first=B.J.|title=Inaugural Ball Benefits Staffer Who Died During Campaign|url=http://www.nbcchicago.com/blogs/ward-room/obama-inauguration-2013-staff-ball-alex-okrent--187985291.html|publisher=[[WMAQ-TV]] ([[Chicago, Illinois]])|accessdate=16 August 2013|archive-date=November 11, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111012354/http://www.nbcchicago.com/blogs/ward-room/obama-inauguration-2013-staff-ball-alex-okrent--187985291.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

As in the case of the prayer service for the 2009 inauguration, the theme of the interfaith worship service reflected inclusiveness and religious diversity, ranging from a mix of Protestant pastors, female Rabbi, Hindu, and Muslim religious leaders to Catholic and Episcopal bishops. Featured speakers at the prayer service included religious leaders from the National African American Clergy Network, Islamic Society of North America, in addition to the Metropolitan Community Churches that served as a spiritual refuge and place of worship for gay Christians.<ref name=washcathdl/><ref>{{cite news|last=Kerr|first=Jennifer C.|title=Obamas, Bidens Attend Washington National Cathedral Prayer Service|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/01/22/obamas-bidens-attend-wash_n_2526099.html|work=The Huffington Post|publisher=Associated Press|accessdate=16 August 2013|date=22 January 2013|archive-date=October 21, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021112516/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/01/22/obamas-bidens-attend-wash_n_2526099.html|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Banks|first=Adelle M.|title=Preachers pray for unity at National Cathedral inaugural service|url=http://www.religionnews.com/2013/01/22/preachers-pray-for-unity-at-national-cathedral-inaugural-service/|publisher=Religious News Service|accessdate=16 August 2013|date=22 January 2013|archive-date=October 4, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004233131/http://www.religionnews.com/2013/01/22/preachers-pray-for-unity-at-national-cathedral-inaugural-service/|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Reaction to inaugural address==
{{see also|International reactions to the United States presidential election, 2012}}
The loudest response from the audience at the National Mall coincided with Obama's remarks supporting [[Male–female income disparity in the United States|equal pay for women]] and [[LGBT social movements|equal treatment for sexual minorities]], when he stated that America's journey to equality is incomplete "until our wives, our mothers, and daughters can earn a living equal to their efforts," and "until our gay brothers and sisters are treated like anyone else under the law."<ref name="CNNBasu20130121" /><ref>{{cite news|title=Sworn in again, Obama lingers for last look|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2013/01/21/politics/obama-inauguration/index.html?hpt=po_c2|publisher=CNN|accessdate=24 January 2013|author=Matt Smith and Tom Cohen|date=22 January 2012|archive-date=February 22, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222221326/http://edition.cnn.com/2013/01/21/politics/obama-inauguration/index.html?hpt=po_c2|url-status=live}}</ref> Obama "made history", said Human Rights Campaign President Chad Griffin, when Obama connected the struggle of gay couple to the equal rights movement writ large.

The programs that Obama called for were characteristically liberal: reaffirming the social safety net, equal pay for women, etc. Nothing new here -- just the Obama classic.

A consequential one, certainly, but one that reflects centrist views or center-left ones at most.

Republican congressional leaders had a muted, bipartisan response to Obama's second inaugural address and expressed their hope for cooperation between their party and Obama. "There are plenty of areas of disagreement but there are also some things that, fundamentally, we agree on -- and that is this country is one of opportunity," House Majority Leader [[Eric Cantor]] said.<ref name="CNNBashStewart20130122" /> He added that there were partisan differences over "the way we get there to help everybody. ...

McConnell wrote that Obama's speech was a "fresh start" to address the issue of federal spending and debt: "Republicans are eager to work with the president on achieving this common goal and we firmly believe that divided government provides the perfect opportunity to do so. Together, there is much we can achieve."<ref name="CNNBashStewart20130122" /> He also praised Obama's speech as "a really good speech. People can criticize President Obama about a lot of things. But not his ability to communicate. I think he communicated to the American people a message of hope, a message of action and I liked it very much."<ref name="WPSonmezKeefe20130122" />

Other Republicans were critical of Obama. House Budget Committee Chairman [[Paul Ryan]] said Obama mischaracterized Republicans' position on federal entitlement programs. "No one is suggesting that what we call our earned entitlements – entitlements you pay for, like payroll taxes for Medicare and Social Security – are putting you in a 'taker' category."<ref name="WPSonmezKeefe20130122">{{cite news|title=Paul Ryan, congressional Republicans slam Obama's second inaugural address|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2013/01/22/paul-ryan-congressional-republicans-slam-obamas-second-inaugural-address/|accessdate=27 January 2013|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=22 January 2013|author=Felicia Sonmez and Ed O'Keefe|archive-date=May 11, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150511164052/http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2013/01/22/paul-ryan-congressional-republicans-slam-obamas-second-inaugural-address/|url-status=live}}</ref> Ryan contended that Obama made a "switcheroo" in his speech by suggesting that Republicans have referred to beneficiaries of those programs as "takers." In reality, he said, that term refers to recipients of welfare and other non-"earned" entitlements.<ref name="WPSonmezKeefe20130122" /> U.S. Senator Mike Lee, a frequent Obama critic, expressed his opinion that Obama chose not to unite the country, but to divide the American people. "This is not the approach of a leader attempting to find solutions to problems but rather the tactics of a partisan trying to pick political fights. His vision for the next four years is clear: defend a broken system, ignore the fiscal crisis, and drive future generations further into debt."<ref name="WPSonmezKeefe20130122" /> Other Republicans like John McCain ("I didn't hear any conciliatory remarks")<ref name="Benen20130122" /> and "pundits from the D.C. establishment"<ref name="Benen20130122">{{cite web|last=Benen|first=Steve|title=I didn't hear any conciliatory remarks|url=http://maddowblog.msnbc.com/_news/2013/01/22/16643164-the-discomfort-with-an-unapologetic-president?lite|work=The Maddow Blog|publisher=MSNBC|accessdate=27 January 2013|date=22 January 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130129084917/http://maddowblog.msnbc.com/_news/2013/01/22/16643164-the-discomfort-with-an-unapologetic-president?lite|archive-date=January 29, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> also complained about Obama's speech.<ref name="Benen20130122" /> ''The Washington Post''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Dana Milbank, for example, wrote that Obama's address "was less an inaugural address for the ages than a leftover campaign speech combined with an early draft of the State of the Union address."<ref>{{cite news|last=Milbank|first=Dana|title=Preaching to the choir|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/dana-milbank-preaching-to-the-choir/2013/01/21/f37223a8-6421-11e2-85f5-a8a9228e55e7_story.html|accessdate=27 January 2013|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=22 January 2013|archive-date=November 5, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161105063605/https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/dana-milbank-preaching-to-the-choir/2013/01/21/f37223a8-6421-11e2-85f5-a8a9228e55e7_story.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

While Professor of history and public affairs at [[Princeton University]] Julian Zelizer called the speech a "powerful oration for a contentious moment in national politics",<ref name="CNNOBLiberalDefense20130121">{{cite news|title=Obama's ringing defense of liberalism|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2013/01/21/opinion/opinion-inauguration-roundup/index.html|publisher=CNN|accessdate=24 January 2013|date=21 January 2013|archive-date=January 24, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130124103021/http://edition.cnn.com/2013/01/21/opinion/opinion-inauguration-roundup/index.html|url-status=live}}</ref> [[Georgetown University]] professor Donna Brazile called it "a deeply moving and patriotic speech" and "one of the most effective usages of the founding documents' principles as a supporting narrative -- drawing us from the past to the present to the future" by "a president sharing with the nation his values most personal and vision most spiritual."<ref name="CNNOBLiberalDefense20130121" /> [[Oxford University]] historian Timothy Stanley wrote that Obama, compared to "one of those "bring us together", delivered "a more policy specific speech that reflected the difficult, partisan reality of 2013."<ref name="CNNOBLiberalDefense20130121" /> Obama's moral commitment to gay rights - expressed in the words "for if we are truly created equal, then surely the love we commit to one another must be equal as well" was "controversial but admirably courageous."<ref name="CNNOBLiberalDefense20130121" /> For Maria Cardona, a former senior adviser to [[Hillary Clinton]], "Obama's message is still one of hope and change. ... He gave his supporters hope he will continue to fight for them. He gave all Americans the assurance the country will continue to change for the better."<ref name="CNNOBLiberalDefense20130121" />

Senior political columnist for ''[[Newsweek]]'' and ''[[The Daily Beast]]'' John Avlon lauded Obama for "an audacious speech to the extent that Obama sought to reclaim politicized concepts like [[American exceptionalism]] from their conservative contexts, making the case that the combination of diversity and opportunity makes the American Dream possible for each new generation."<ref name="CNNOBLiberalDefense20130121" /> But Avlon also criticed Obama writing that "the scope of the speech was sprawling and dotted with policy references more suited to a State of the Union address. It was not tightly framed or focused on a single concept, nor was there a single clear phrase that summed up the speech, at least at first listen."<ref name="CNNOBLiberalDefense20130121" />

President [[Jimmy Carter]] former deputy chief speechwriter Gordon Stewart wrote that Obama's "magnificent" second inaugural  address was far better than his [[First inauguration of Barack Obama|first inaugural address]]. Stewart lauded that Obama for emerging "as a leader who has stopped splitting differences and is prepared to make choices and fight for them."<ref name="CNNStewart20130122">{{cite news|last=Stewart|first=Gordon|title=Obama finally meets Machiavelli|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2013/01/21/opinion/stewart-obama-inaugural-speech/index.html?iid=article_sidebar|publisher=CNN|accessdate=24 January 2013|date=22 January 2013|archive-date=January 24, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130124102916/http://edition.cnn.com/2013/01/21/opinion/stewart-obama-inaugural-speech/index.html?iid=article_sidebar|url-status=live}}</ref> According to Stewart both Obama's supporters and opponents have a clearer idea what Obama will do in his second term.<ref name="CNNStewart20130122" /> Former CNN producer and correspondent Frida Ghitis complained that Obama devoted nearly all his inaugural speech to domestic issues and said that international disengagement isn't an option for American. According to Ghitis the aspirations Obama "expressed for America are the ones he should express for our tumultuous planet."<ref name="CNNGhitis20130122" /> She expressed her hopes that Obama "can remember America's leadership position and devote more attention to those around the world who see it as a source of inspiration and encouragement."<ref name="CNNGhitis20130122" /> After neglecting to mention a single foreign country by name during his address, [[The Economist]] concluded that Obama's "second term will have little emphasis on foreign affairs."<ref>{{cite news|title=The re-inauguration of Barack Obama: Gloves off|url=https://www.economist.com/news/united-states/21570712-uncompromising-words-president-who-will-never-have-face-voters-again-gloves|accessdate=28 January 2013|newspaper=The Economist|date=26 January 2013|archive-date=December 20, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220045622/http://www.economist.com/news/united-states/21570712-uncompromising-words-president-who-will-never-have-face-voters-again-gloves|url-status=live}}</ref>

Gergen noticed that Obama stressed equality in the tradition of Abraham Lincoln's [[Gettysburg Address]] and Martin Luther King's "[[I Have a Dream]]". According to Gergen the speech Obama's was "firmest attempt to build upon Lincoln and King - and in effect, his address made him their modern heir."<ref name="Gergen20130122">{{cite news|last=Gergen|first=David|title=Obama's historic speech deepens divisions|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2013/01/23/opinion/gergen-obama-history/index.html?iid=article_sidebar|publisher=CNN|accessdate=24 January 2013|date=23 January 2013|archive-date=January 24, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130124103015/http://edition.cnn.com/2013/01/23/opinion/gergen-obama-history/index.html?iid=article_sidebar|url-status=live}}</ref>  President Obama's green jobs adviser in 2009, Van Jones, called Obama's speech "offered the best rebuttal to date" since "President [[Ronald Reagan]] launched an era of anti-government politics with his [[First inauguration of Ronald Reagan|first inaugural address]].".<ref name="CNNVanJones20130123">{{cite news|last=Jones|first=Van|title=Obama speech: Anti-government era is over|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2013/01/22/opinion/jones-obama-speech/index.html?iid=article_sidebar|publisher=CNN|accessdate=24 January 2013|date=23 January 2013|archive-date=January 24, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130124102930/http://edition.cnn.com/2013/01/22/opinion/jones-obama-speech/index.html?iid=article_sidebar|url-status=live}}</ref> Comparing Reagan and Obama, Van Jones wrote: "Instead of "government is the problem," the president reminded us that we could all fall victim to sudden misfortune. Instead of pinning blame for every social problem on the size of government, the president recognized both individual responsibility and the role of community in giving each child the opportunity to succeed."<ref name="CNNVanJones20130123" /> Van Jones noted both presidents invoked famous places of American history in their inaugural addresses but differed substantially in these places. While Reagan chose places of battles, Obama "tied [[Stonewall riots|Stonewall]] in with [[Selma to Montgomery marches|Selma]] and cemented his declaration that lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights are civil rights."<ref name="CNNVanJones20130123" /> David Rothkopf, CEO and editor-at-large of the FP Group (publishers of [[Foreign Policy magazine]]), wrote that Obama rightly demanded equal rights for gays and equal pay for women. According to Rothkopf Obama's words sketched an America better than what the [[Founding Fathers of the United States]] imagined. Rothkopf wrote: "The great beauty of the speech was not in any particular phrase, but in that the man in question and the country he leads were in so many ways far beyond what the Founders could have imagined. And that, despite our natural tendency to glorify our origins, that this America was in virtually every way better than the one they offered up to us."<ref>{{cite news|last=Rothkopf|first=David|title=Obama's America, better than what Founders imagined|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2013/01/21/opinion/rothkopf-better-america/index.html|publisher=CNN|accessdate=24 January 2013|date=22 January 2013|archive-date=January 25, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130125032414/http://edition.cnn.com/2013/01/21/opinion/rothkopf-better-america/index.html|url-status=live}}</ref>
