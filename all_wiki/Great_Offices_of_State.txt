==History==
The Great Offices of State are derived from the most senior positions in the [[Royal Household]] – the [[Great Officers of State]]. These eventually became hereditary and honorary titles, while the substantive duties of the Officers passed to individuals who were appointed on behalf of the Crown.<ref name="PhillipsChalmers1952">{{cite book|last1=Phillips|first1=Owen Hood|last2=Chalmers|first2=Dalzell|title=The constitutional law of Great Britain and the Commonwealth|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3TsMAAAAIAAJ|year=1952|publisher=Sweet & Maxwell|page=240}}</ref> The medieval origins of the Chancellorship of the Exchequer make it the oldest surviving Great Office of State, while the position of [[Secretary of State (England)|Secretary of State]] came into being in the late 16th century and the office of Prime Minister evolved gradually in the 18th and 19th centuries.

[[James Callaghan]] is the only person to date to have served in all four positions.<ref name="callaghan"/><ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/lady-callaghan-of-cardiff-530403.html | location=London | work=The Independent | title=Lady Callaghan of Cardiff | date=30 March 2005}}</ref> In the past hundred years, several other people have come close to achieving this distinction: [[H. H. Asquith]] and [[Winston Churchill]] both served as Chancellor, Prime Minister and Home Secretary while [[Harold Macmillan]] and [[John Major]] served as Prime Minister, Chancellor and Foreign Secretary. [[Rab Butler]] and [[John Simon, 1st Viscount Simon|Sir John Simon]] served as Chancellor of the Exchequer, Foreign Secretary and Home Secretary. Two of the Great Offices of State have often been held simultaneously by one person, most recently by [[Ramsay MacDonald]], Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary in 1924; [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|the Duke of Wellington]] is the only person to have held three of the Great Offices simultaneously, serving as Prime Minister, Home Secretary and Foreign Secretary in the [[Wellington caretaker ministry]].

==Commons-only nature in modern times==
Owing to the political constitution of the United Kingdom, in which the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] retains most of the power, it is accepted that it is no longer practical for holders of the Great Offices of State to be members of the [[House of Lords]]. The House of Lords has traditionally been restrained in the passage of financial bills, meaning that the office of Chancellor is effectively limited to the House of Commons. The last holders of the other positions to have been peers were:

*Prime Minister: [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] [[Alec Douglas-Home|The Earl of Home]] (20–23 October 1963): The Earl of Home renounced his peerage and was elected as an MP after his appointment as Prime Minister. The last holder to remain a peer throughout his term as Prime Minister was the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] [[Robert Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury|The Marquess of Salisbury]] (25 June 1895 – 11 July 1902).
*Chancellor of the Exchequer: [[Whig (British political party)|Whig]] [[Thomas Denman, 1st Baron Denman|Lord Denman]] (14 November – 15 December 1834): Denman only held the post on an acting basis as an [[ex officio]] duty of his role as [[Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales|Lord Chief Justice]], as did the peer before him, [[Tories (British political party)|Tory]] [[Charles Abbott, 1st Baron Tenterden|Lord Tenterden]] (8 August–3 September 1827); the last member of the House of Lords to hold the office substantively was [[Whig (British political party)|Whig]] [[James Stanhope, 1st Earl Stanhope|Viscount Stanhope]] (15 April 1717 – 20 March 1718).
*Foreign Secretary: [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] [[Peter Carington, 6th Baron Carrington|Lord Carrington]] (5 May 1979 – 5 April 1982): The Lord Carrington is the most recent peer to hold one of the Great Offices of State.
*Home Secretary: [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] [[George Cave, 1st Viscount Cave|Viscount Cave]] (14 November 1918 – 14 January 1919): Sir George Cave was ennobled as The Viscount Cave while serving as Home Secretary in 1918. The last holder to remain a peer throughout his term as Home Secretary was the [[Whigs (British political party)|Whig]] [[Henry John Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston|Viscount Palmerston]] (28 December 1852 – 6 February 1855). However, he was an [[Peerage of Ireland|Irish peer]], meaning that he was not entitled to a seat in the Lords; the last holder to remain a member of the Lords was the [[Whigs (British political party)|Whig]] [[Constantine Phipps, 1st Marquess of Normanby|The Marquess of Normanby]] (30 August 1839 – 30 August 1841).

It is most exceptional that a holder of a Great Office of State should not hold a seat in Parliament at all, neither in the Commons nor in the Lords. It occurred briefly in 1963, when [[Alec Douglas-Home]] was appointed Prime Minister: he disclaimed his peerage on 23 October, and was not returned to the Commons until a [[1963 Kinross and Western Perthshire by-election|by-election]] on 7 November. More substantially, [[Patrick Gordon Walker]] was appointed Foreign Secretary in 1964 despite not holding a Parliamentary seat, having been defeated in his [[Smethwick (UK Parliament constituency)|Smethwick]] constituency seat in the 1964 general election; he held the post for three months until his resignation in January 1965.

==Women==
Six women have held one or more Great Offices of State, with four of the six being members of the Conservative Party. Out of the four Offices, three have been held by women; Chancellor of the Exchequer is the only position that has not. Due to her ascension to the office of Prime Minister in July 2016, Theresa May became the first woman to hold two different Great Offices of State, with the appointment of Amber Rudd as Home Secretary resulting in the first period in which more than one of the Offices were held by women simultaneously.

'''Prime Minister:'''

*[[Margaret Thatcher]] (1979–1990) (Conservative)
*[[Theresa May]] (2016–2019) (Conservative)

'''Chancellor of the Exchequer:'''

No woman has yet served as [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]].

'''Foreign Secretary''':

*[[Theresa May]] (2010–2016) (Conservative)
*[[Amber Rudd]] (2016–2018) (Conservative)
*[[Priti Patel]] (2019–present) (Conservative)

==Ethnic minorities==
{{Refimprove section|date=April 2020}}
[[Benjamin Disraeli]] became the first person of an ethnic minority to attain one of the Great Offices of State when he was appointed Chancellor of the Exchequer in 1852. Following the resignation of [[Edward Smith-Stanley, 14th Earl of Derby|The Earl of Derby]] in 1868, he also became the first and to date the only person of Jewish heritage to become [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]]. [[Malcolm Rifkind]] and [[David Miliband]] later held the position of [[Foreign Secretary]], with [[Michael Howard]] and [[Leon Brittan]] serving as [[Home Secretary]] and [[Nigel Lawson]] as [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]].

After Amber Rudd's resignation following the [[Windrush scandal]], [[Sajid Javid]] became the first person of Pakistani descent to hold a Great Office of State as Home Secretary and later Chancellor of the Exchequer.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/amp/uk-politics-43947008|title=Who is Sajid Javid, the new home secretary?|date=30 April 2018|work=BBC News|access-date=30 April 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.timesofisrael.com/meet-sajid-javid-uks-top-muslim-pro-israel-politician-who-just-may-become-pm/ |title=Meet Sajid Javid, UK's top Muslim, pro-Israel politician, who just may become PM |last=Philpot |first=Robert |date=13 May 2018 |website=The Times of Israel |access-date=11 July 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180711200734/https://www.timesofisrael.com/meet-sajid-javid-uks-top-muslim-pro-israel-politician-who-just-may-become-pm/ |archive-date=11 July 2018}}</ref> [[Priti Patel]] was appointed as [[Home Secretary]] by [[Boris Johnson]], becoming the first woman of ethnic minority to take the position. After her appointment, three ethnic minority ministers held positions of the Great Offices of State simultaneously for the first time.
