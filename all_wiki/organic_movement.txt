The '''organic movement''' broadly refers to the organizations and individuals involved worldwide in the promotion of [[organic food]] and other organic products. It started during the first half of the 20th century, when modern large-scale [[Agriculture|agricultural]] practices began to appear.{{Citation needed|date=November 2020}}

== Definition ==
An organic product can broadly be described as not containing toxic chemicals (including synthetic [[Pesticide|pesticides]], [[arsenic]]-containing [[Herbicide|herbicides]], fertilization [[biosolids]], which are often found to contain [[Flame retardant|flame retardants]] and drugs among other things, chemical [[food additives]], [[Antibiotic use in livestock|antibiotics]], [[HGH controversies|synthetic hormones]], and industrial [[Solvent|solvents]]). In addition to the absence of artificial chemicals, "organic" means not [[Genetic engineering|genetically engineered]], and having not used [[Ionizing radiation|ionizing irradiation]],<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gNzmOUyiFRAC&pg=PA288|title=The Business of Food: Encyclopedia of the Food and Drink Industries|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=2007|isbn=978-0-313-33725-3|editor1=Allen, Gary J.|page=288|editor2=Albala, Ken}}</ref> which can cause [[Free-radical theory of aging|free-radicals]] and the removal of vitamins.<!-- "Citation needed" but not nonexistant; see relevant article page(s) regarding which source would be best -->{{Citation needed|date=November 2020}} For example, [[National Organic Program|USDA organic]] attempts to restrict against such things including genetic engineering in products or in the products' animal feed,<ref>{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=5 November 2020|title=Electronic Code of Federal Regulations (eCFR)|url=https://www.ecfr.gov/|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-11-08|website=Electronic Code of Federal Regulations (eCFR)|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=1 May 2013|title=Can GMOs Be Used in Organic Products? {{!}} Agricultural Marketing Service|url=https://www.ams.usda.gov/publications/content/can-gmos-be-used-organic-products|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-11-07|website=www.ams.usda.gov}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=McEvoy|first=Miles|date=21 February 2017|title=Organic 101: Can GMOs Be Used in Organic Products?|url=https://www.usda.gov/media/blog/2013/05/17/organic-101-can-gmos-be-used-organic-products|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-11-07|website=www.usda.gov|language=en}}</ref> and automatically allows the use of "Non-[[Genetically modified organism|GMO]]" labelling similar to [[The Non-GMO Project]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=McEvoy|first=Miles|date=21 February 2017|title=New Allowances for Including a “Non-GMO” Statement on Certified Organic Meat and Poultry Products|url=https://www.usda.gov/media/blog/2016/09/21/new-allowances-including-non-gmo-statement-certified-organic-meat-and-poultry|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-11-07|website=www.usda.gov|language=en}}</ref>

== History ==
{{Main|History of organic farming}}

=== Origin ===
The organic movement began in the early 1900s in response to the shift towards synthetic nitrogen fertilizers and pesticides in the early days of [[industrial agriculture]]. A relatively small group of farmers  came together in various associations: [[Demeter International]] of Germany, which encouraged [[biodynamic farming]] and began the first certification program, the [[Australian Organic Farming and Gardening Society]],<ref name="Paull2008">Paull, John [http://www.orgprints.org/15089/1/15089new.pdf "The Lost History of Organic Farming in Australia"], ''Journal of Organic Systems'', 2008, 3(2):2-17.</ref> the [[Soil Association]] of the United Kingdom, and [[Rodale Press]] in the United States, along with others. In 1972 these organizations joined to form the [[International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements]] (IFOAM). In recent years, environmental awareness has driven demand and conversion to organic farming. Some governments, including the European Union, have begun to support organic farming through [[agricultural subsidy]] reform. Organic production and marketing have grown at a fast pace.

Historians consider [[Albert Howard]], [[Gerard Wallop, 9th Earl of Portsmouth|Viscount Lymington]], [[Robert McCarrison]], [[Edgar J. Saxon]] and [[Frank Newman Turner]] as pioneers of the organic movement in Britain,<ref>{{cite journal|author=Conford, Philip|year=1998|title=A Forum for Organic Husbandry: The "New English Weekly" and Agricultural Policy, 1939–1949|journal=[[Agricultural History Review]]|volume=46|issue=2|pages=197-210}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|author=Conford, Philip|year=2002|title=The Myth of Neglect: Responses to the Early Organic Movement, 1930-1950 |journal=[[Agricultural History Review]]|volume=50|issue=1|pages=80-106}}</ref><ref>Lockeretz, William.

Today, organic foods stores have captured a significant share of the grocery shopping market, specifically, [[Whole Foods Market]], [[Wild Oats Markets|Wild Oats]], [[Trader Joe's|Trader joe's]] and others.

=== Timeline ===
* In the summer of 1924 [[Rudolf Steiner]] presented what has been called the first organic agriculture course to a group of over one hundred farmers and others at Koberwitz, now [[Kobierzyce]], [[Poland]].<sup>[8]</sup><ref>Paull, John (2011) [https://www.academia.edu/9149070/Attending_the_first_organic_agriculture_course_Rudolf_Steiner_s_Agriculture_Course_at_Koberwitz_1924  "Attending the First Organic Agriculture Course: Rudolf Steiner’s Agriculture Course at Koberwitz, 1924"], European Journal of Social Sciences, 21(1):64-70.</ref> In Germany [[Rudolf Steiner]]'s Spiritual Foundations for the Renewal of Agriculture, published in 1924, led to the popularization of [[biodynamic agriculture]], probably the first comprehensive organic farming system, that was based on Steiner's [[Anthroposophy|spiritual and philosophical teachings]].
* The first use of the term "organic farming" is by Lord Northbourne (aka [[Walter James, 4th Baron Northbourne]]). The term derives from his concept of "the farm as organism", which he expounded in his book, Look to the Land (1940), and in which he described a holistic, ecologically balanced approach to farming. Northbourne wrote of "chemical farming versus organic farming". http://www.orgprints.org/10138.
* In 1939, strongly influenced by Sir Howard's work, [[Lady Eve Balfour]] launched the [[Haughley Experiment]] on farmland in England. It was the first, side-by-side comparison of organic and conventional farming. Four years later, she published ''[[The Living Soil]]'', based on the initial findings of the Haughley Experiment. It was widely read, and lead to the formation of a key international organic advocacy group, the [[Soil Association]].
* [[Sir Albert Howard]]'s 1940 book, ''[[An Agricultural Testament]]'', was influential in promoting organic techniques, and his 1947 book "The Soil and Health, A Study of Organic Agriculture" adopted Northbourne's terminology and was the first book to include "organic" agriculture or farming in its title.
* During the 1950s, sustainable agriculture was a research topic of interest. The science tended to concentrate on the new chemical approaches. In the [[United States|U.S.]], [[J.I. Rodale]] began to popularize the term and methods of organic growing. In addition to agricultural research, Rodale's publications through the [[Rodale Press]] helped to promote [[organic gardening]] to the general public.
* In 1962, [[Rachel Carson]], a prominent scientist and [[Natural history|naturalist]], published ''[[Silent Spring]]'', chronicling the effects of [[DDT]] and other pesticides on the environment drawing on the research of [[biodynamic agriculture]] advocates [[Marjorie Spock]], Mary T. Richards and [[Ehrenfried Pfeiffer]].<ref name=RCarson>Paull, John (2013) [https://www.academia.edu/9149162/The_Rachel_Carson_letters_and_the_making_of_Silent_Spring  "The Rachel Carson Letters and the Making of Silent Spring"],   SAGE Open, 3 (July), pp. 1-12.</ref><sup>[9]</sup> A bestseller in many countries, including the US, and widely read around the world, ''Silent Spring'' was instrumental in the US government's 1972 banning of DDT. The book and its author are often credited with launching the environmental movement.<ref name=RCarson/>
* In the 1970s, worldwide movements concerned with environmental pollution caused by persistent agrichemical increased attention on organic farming. One goal of the ''organic movement'' was to promote consumption of [[Local food|locally grown food]], which was promoted through slogans such as ''"Know Your Farmer, Know Your Food"''.
* In 1972, the International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements ([[IFOAM]]), was founded in Versailles, France. IFOAM was dedicated to the diffusion of information on the principles and practices of organic agriculture across national and linguistic boundaries. In the same year, [[John Battendieri]] founded Santa Cruz Organics, which marketed some of the first packaged organic products.<sup>[10]</sup>
* In the 1980s, around the world, various farming and consumer groups began seriously pressuring for government regulation of organic production to ensure standards of production. This led to various legislation and certification standards being enacted through the 1990s and to date. Currently, most aspects of organic food production are government-regulated in the US and the European Union.
* In the 2000s, the worldwide market for organic products (including food, beauty, health, bodycare, and household products, and fabrics) has grown rapidly. More countries are establishing formal, government-regulated [[Organic certification]]. Monitoring and challenging certification rules and decisions have become a regular, high profile aspect of activists in the organic movement.

==Organic food==
{{Main|Organic food}}
Specifications for what may be classified as organic food may vary by location. According to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), organic food is produced by farmers who emphasize the use of renewable resources and the conservation of soil and water to enhance the quality of the environment.<ref>“Introduction to Organic Practices.” Introduction to Organic Practices | Agricultural Marketing Service, USDA, www.ams.usda.gov/publications/content/introduction-organic-practices.
</ref> Organic poultry and dairy products come from animals that are given no antibiotics or growth hormones. Organic food is produced without the use of synthetic pesticides or fertilizers, bioengineering, and ionizing radiation. Before a product can be labeled "organic", a Government-approved certifier inspects the farm where the food is grown to make sure the farmer is following all the rules necessary to meet USDA organic standards. Companies that handle or process organic food before it reaches supermarkets and restaurants must be certified as well.

==Organic companies==
The recent interest in the organic industry has sparked the interest of many businesses from small local distributors to large companies that distribute many products nationally. The organic market is now a 14 billion dollar a year industry, that continues to grow especially from large corporations such as Wal-Mart that are now offering organic choices to their customers.<ref>[http://cnas.tamu.edu/The%20New%20Horizon%20for%20Organics.pdf Clark, Georgia. "The New Horizon for Organics: A Market Outlook of the Effects of Wal-Mart on the International Organic Market". June 2007]</ref> Other companies that offer organic options include General Mills and Kraft. Some large companies have bought smaller already established organic companies such as Earth’s Best, Rice Dream soy milk, Garden of Eatin', Celestial Seasonings and Health Valley. When larger companies buy smaller companies it is called [[stealth ownership]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Emergent-Agriculture-Farming-Sustainability-Economy/dp/0865717737/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1461723770&sr=8-1&keywords=emergent+agriculture|title=The Emergent Agriculture: Farming, Sustainability and the Return of the Local Economy|last=Kleppel|first=Gary|last2=Ikerd|first2=John|date=2014-07-22|publisher=New Society Publishers|isbn=9780865717732|language=English}}</ref>

==Organic cosmetics==
Organic cosmetics are products that are made with organic ingredients that were produced without the use of synthetic pesticides, herbicides, fungicides, and fertilizers.

The [https://www.fda.gov/Cosmetics/Labeling/Claims/ucm203078.htm FDA] does not have a definition of “Organic” in terms of organic cosmetics. FDA regulates cosmetics under the authority of the [[Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act]]  (FD&C Act) and the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act (FPLA).

The USDA (the U.S. Department of Agriculture) requirements for the use of the term “organic” are separate from the laws and regulations that FDA applies for cosmetics. For more information on "organic" labeling for cosmetics, see the NOP publication, "[http://www.ams.usda.gov/AMSv1.0/getfile?dDocName=STELPRDC5068442 Cosmetics, Body Care Products, and Personal Care Products]." Cosmetic products labeled with “organic” must follow both USDA regulations and FDA regulations of organic claims for labeling and safety requirements for cosmetics.

The Agricultural Marketing Service of USDA supervises the [[National Organic Program]] (NOP). The NOP regulations have the definition of “organic” and provide certification for agricultural ingredients if they have been produced under conditions that would meet the definition. Moreover, the regulations also include labeling standards based on the percentage of organic ingredients in every product.<ref>[http://www.access.gpo.gov/nara/cfr/waisidx_10/7cfr205_10.html Gpo.gov]</ref>

The [[Cosmos (standard)|COSMetic Organic and Natural Standard]] (COSMOS) sets certification requirements for organic and natural cosmetics products in Europe.<ref name="Cosper-Understanding-COSMOS">{{cite web|last1=Alex|first1=Cosper|title=Understanding COSMOS - the COSMetics organic and natural standard|url=https://www.desjardin.fr/en/blog/understanding-cosmos-the-cosmetics-organic-and-natural-standard|publisher=Desjardin|accessdate=30 January 2018}}</ref>

==Organic farming==
Organic farming is a form of agriculture that relies on techniques such as [[crop rotation]], green manure, compost, and biological pest control.
{{Main|Organic farming}}

==Criticisms==
There have been multiple criticisms regarding organic food and organic marketing practices. Scientists at the University of Washington did a test of the urine of children who are on organic food diets and children who are on conventional food diets. The result was children on organic food diets ‘ urine had a median level of pesticide byproducts only one-sixth of children on conventional food diets. However, at the same time French, British and Swedish government food agencies have all concluded that there was no scientific proof that organic food is safer or has more nutrition than conventional foods.<ref>{{Cite book|title=FOOD|last=Jan|first=Grover|last2=Singer|first2=Peter|last3=Mason|first3=Jim|publisher=Greenhaven Press|year=2008|isbn=978-0737737943|location=Detroit|pages=[https://archive.org/details/food0000grov/page/170 170–171]|url=https://archive.org/details/food0000grov/page/170}}</ref>
