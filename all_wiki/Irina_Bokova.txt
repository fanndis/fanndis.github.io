As Director-General of UNESCO, Bokova led efforts to block the trade in Syrian and Iraqi cultural artifacts to fund ISIS and other radical Islamist groups. These efforts led to the adoption of United Nations Security Council Resolution 2199 on 12 February 2015.

He informed the Bulgarian Parliament that the campaign consists of three stages – information-consultative one – until September 2015, the essential stage – between September 2015 and April 2016, and the last stage – from May 2016 until October–December 2016.

On 9 February 2016 the Bulgarian Foreign Ministry announced that her candidacy for the top UN job has been officially submitted to the United Nations for consideration.<ref>[http://www.mfa.bg/bg/events/6/1/4454/index.html Message from the Bulgarian Foreign Ministry] (in Bulgarian)</ref> On 11 February Bulgarian media reported that the Foreign Ministry has allocated BGN 106,300 (approx. $60,000 at the time of the publication) for the election campaign.<ref>[https://www.24chasa.bg/Article/5295173 The State to provide BGN 106 300 for Irina Bokova campaign] (article in 24 hours daily, in Bulgarian)</ref>

After five informal polls at the UN Security council, in which Bokova took between third and sixth place, on 28 September 2016, the Bulgarian government announced <ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2016/09/28/world/europe/ap-eu-bulgaria-un.html Bulgaria Replaces Candidate for the United Nations' Top Job]</ref> that it is nominating another candidate – the European commissioner [[Kristalina Georgieva]]. Since the rules of nominating UN Secretary-General do not provide the option of ''replacing'' a candidate, unless he or she has agreed to stand down, which Irina Bokova has said<ref>[https://www.24chasa.bg/novini/article/5785297 I am still in the competition, 24 hours daily] (in Bulgarian)</ref> she won't do, from 28 September 2016 there are two Bulgarian candidates, with Kristalina Georgieva being the "''sole and unique candidate of Bulgaria''".<ref>[https://www.un.org/pga/71/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2016/01/Next-Secretary-General-selection_nomination-of-new-candidate-of-Bulgaria.pdf?platform=hootsuite Letter to the President of the General Assembly] (PDF)</ref>

=== Statements and Positions ===
As a candidate to replace [[Ban Ki-moon]], Bokova participated in informal dialogues at the UN and other conferences to defend her positions and explain her candidature. When prompted by St. Vincent and the Grenadines and an informal dialogue at the UN, Bokova responded by emphasizing her understanding of the problem as she had recently traveled to Haiti, and her acknowledgement of the various UN agencies that have make substantial efforts to cope with this issue.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://webtv.un.org/search/irina-bokova-bulgaria-informal-dialogue-for-the-position-of-the-next-un-secretary-general/4842691541001?term=irina%2520bokova|title=Irina Bokova (Bulgaria) – Informal dialogue for the position of the next UN Secretary-General|access-date=2016-06-27}}</ref>

In response to a plenary question on the UN's role in regards to cholera in Haiti at the International Peace Institute, Bokova responded, "Of course I know about this problem and I know that there is a legal process that is being engaged in currently. I do not know the details of this legal process, I just know that it is going there and I know that there is an idea to establish a fund for indemnities. I will be advocating also for this action to be taken."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ipinst.org/2016/06/unsg-candidate-irina-bokova#2|title=The Secretary-General Candidates at IPI: Irina Bokova of Bulgaria|access-date=2016-06-27}}</ref>

On sexual exploitation and abuse by UN peacekeepers, Bokova made this issue central to her vision statement. "I am determined to work with governments and the civil society to combat any kind of violence against women and girls... There can be no excuse for the appalling crimes of sexual violence and I consider that the UN has to take the lead in showing strong commitment to ending impunity for violence against women and girls."<ref>http://webtv.un.org/search/irina-bokova-bulgaria-informal-dialogue-for-the-position-of-the-next-un-secretary-general/4842691541001?term=irina</ref>

On jihadism, she said she would try to get the UN to do more to curb the threat of Isis, saying cultural dialogue and education were key to curbing jihadism which is "one of the threats to peace, one of the threats to societies," adding that "Isis/Daesh is about the destruction of societies. They pit communities against one another".<ref>[http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/un-secretary-general-frontrunner-irina-bokova-says-us-must-do-more-stop-isis-1571848] (article by Brendan Cole, published at International Business Times UK)</ref>

===Endorsements===
Bokova's candidacy collected a number of endorsements. In July 2015 [[The Guardian]] published an article,<ref>{{cite news|author=Salima Yacoubi Soussane|url=https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2015/jul/09/will-the-next-un-secretary-general-be-a-woman|title= Will the next UN secretary general be a woman?|date=9 July 2015|accessdate=13 August 2015|work=[[The Guardian]]}}</ref> titled ''Will the next UN secretary general be a woman?'' with a picture of Irina Bokova and a description ''The head of Unesco, Irina Bokova from Bulgaria, is a favourite to become the UN's new secretary general in 2017.''

Bulgarian weekly Capital wrote a page<ref>{{cite news|author=Nikola Nikolov|url=http://www.capital.bg/politika_i_ikonomika/sviat/2014/08/16/2362174_po_putia_kum_vurha_na_oon/|title=On the road to the top of the UN|date=16 August 2014|accessdate=13 August 2015|work=[[Capital Weekly]]}}</ref> about her candidacy, which states, among other, 
<blockquote>
Bokova demonstrates diplomatic and governance skills in a big international organization – UNESCO, which she heads for a second term. She has good reputation to the permanent five members of the UN Security Council. She speaks fluently English, French, Spanish and Russian – four of the six official UN languages (the requirement is for two). She has a clear vision about the mission and activity of the organization.
</blockquote>
In July 2015 EurActiv published an article<ref>[http://www.euractiv.com/sections/global-europe/next-un-secretary-general-bokova-ticks-all-boxes-316370 The next UN Secretary-General? Bokova ticks all the boxes] (article by Dick Roche, published at EurActiv)</ref> by former Irish Minister for European Affairs and Minister for the Environment Dick Roche, titled ''The next UN Secretary-General? Bokova ticks all the boxes'', arguing in favor of Irina Bokova's candidacy.

On 29 September 2015, David Clark, chairman of the Russia Foundation, published an article<ref>{{Cite web|title = Eastern Europe must grab its chance to name the next UN Secretary General|url = http://blogs.ft.com/beyond-brics/2015/09/29/eastern-europe-must-grab-its-chance-to-name-the-next-un-secretary-general/|accessdate = 1 October 2015|publisher=Financial Times}}</ref> in the ''[[Financial Times]]''{{'}} ''beyondbrics forum''. In it the author comments: "Of the women from Eastern Europe being discussed is Irina Bokova, the current head of UNESCO and former Bulgarian foreign minister. She is considered to be a front-runner."

On 2 October 2015, governor Bill Richardson wrote an opinion for ''[[The Washington Post]]'', "The next U.N. secretary general should be a woman". There he describes women, who are considered as potential candidates. About Bokova, he writes, "several leading candidates are beginning to emerge. Irina Bokova, director general of UNESCO and Bulgaria’s official candidate, fulfills many of the required criteria and is seen by many as the front-runner. She has taken a strong stance on the fight against extremism and terror financing and is actively championing women empowerment and girls’ education."<ref>{{Cite news|title = The next U.N. secretary general should be a woman|url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/10/02/the-next-u-n-secretary-general-should-be-a-woman/|accessdate = 10 October 2015|work=The Washington Post}}</ref>

On 4 July 2016 the French newspaper ''[[L'Opinion (newspaper)|L'Opinion]]'' published an open letter in support of Irina Bokova's candidacy. The letter was signed by a number of famous and respected French, among them [[Christine Albanel]], [[Yann Arthus-Bertrand]], [[Pierre Bergé]], [[Hélène Carrère d’Encausse]], [[Jean-Pierre Chevènement]], [[Yves Coppens]], [[Édith Cresson]], [[Xavier Darcos]], [[Pierre Gattaz]], [[Jean-Michel Jarre]], [[Bariza Khiari]], [[Beate Klarsfeld]], [[Serge Klarsfeld]], [[Julia Kristeva]], [[Catherine Lalumière]], [[Laurence Parisot]], [[Stéphane Richard]], [[Eric de Rothschild]]. They urged the French President and the French government to support the nomination of Bokova, as this is in the interests of France, and also to promote their position to the other members of the UN Security Council and the UN General Assembly.<ref>{{Cite web|title = ONU: l'urgence d'une nouvelle ère|url = http://www.lopinion.fr/edition/international/onu-l-urgence-d-nouvelle-ere-106125|accessdate = 5 July 2016|publisher=L'Opinion}}</ref>
