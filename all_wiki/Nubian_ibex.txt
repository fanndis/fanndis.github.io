The '''Nubian ibex''' (''Capra nubiana'') is a desert-dwelling [[goat]] species found in mountainous areas of [[North Africa|northern]] and [[Horn of Africa|northeast]] Africa, and the [[Middle East]]. Its range is within [[Algeria]], [[Egypt]], [[Ethiopia]], [[Eritrea]], [[Israel]], [[Jordan]], [[Oman]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Sudan]], and [[Yemen]]. It is [[Local extinction|extirpated]] in [[Lebanon]]. It is historically considered to be a [[subspecies]] of the [[Alpine ibex]] (''C. ibex''), but is increasingly considered a specifically distinct species (''C. nubiana''). The wild population is estimated at 1,200 individuals.

==Description==
[[File:Juvenile Nubian ibex in Mitzpe Ramon (40409).jpg|thumb|Juvenile Nubian ibex]]
Nubian ibexes stand around 65–75&nbsp;cm (2.1–2.6&nbsp;ft) tall at the shoulder and weigh around {{convert|50|kg|abbr=on}}. They are a light tan color, with a white underbelly; males also have a dark brown stripe down their backs. Nubian ibexes have long, thin horns that extend up and then backwards and down. In males, these reach around 1 m in length, while in females they are much smaller (around {{convert|30|cm|abbr=on}}).<ref name=Kingdon>{{cite book|author1=Jonathan Kingdon|author2=David Happold|author3=Thomas Butynski|author4=Michael Hoffmann|author5=Meredith Happold|author6=Jan Kalina|title=Mammals of Africa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B_07noCPc4kC&pg=PA600 |year=2013 |publisher=A&C Black|isbn=978-1-4081-8996-2 |pages=600–603}}</ref>

==Ecology==
[[File:Capra nubiana, Israel 15.jpg|thumb|right|Young Nubian ibex in [[Sde Boker]]]]
Nubian ibexes live in rough, dry, mountainous terrain, where they eat mainly [[grass]]es and [[leaves]] and are preyed upon by [[leopard]]s, [[wolf|wolves]], [[Red fox|common foxes]], [[eagle]]s, and [[bearded vulture]]s. They are social and herds tend to consist of females, young, and males up to the age of about three years. The males are solitary or form more transitory bands of up to eight individuals. During the breeding season, males join the female-based herds for the six- to eight-week rut. Large males then do battle with much clashing of horns.<ref name=Kingdon/>

Nubian ibexes are [[diurnal animal|diurnal]], meaning they are active during the day, and rest at night. On 16 March 1959, the British established the [[Yob Wildlife Reserve]] in northern Eritrea specifically to protect significant populations of Nubian ibex in the area.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.protectedplanet.net/sites/Yob_Wildlife_Reserve | title=Yob Wildlife Reserve | publisher=Protectedplanet.net | access-date=30 May 2012}}</ref><ref name="ShackletonGroup1997">{{cite book|last=Shackleton|first=David M.|title=Wild Sheep and Goats and Their Relatives: Status Survey and Conservation Action Plan for Caprinae|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hJBodAXB9eoC&pg=PA26|year=1997|publisher=International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources.

The [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] has classified the Nubian ibex as "[[Vulnerable species|vulnerable]]" on the basis that fewer than 10,000 mature individuals remain and the population is declining. Threats faced by the animal include competition with livestock for water and fodder, hunting pressure, and [[habitat destruction]].<ref name=iucn/>

In [[Israel]], the historically dense ibex population, described in the Bible (Psalm 104:18), was decimated in the wake of the First World War when the sudden availability of rifles enabled Bedouin to hunt them to near extinction.<ref>The remarkable return of the ibex; [[Alon Tal]], 16 October 2019, The Times of Israel, [https://blogs.timesofisrael.com/the-remarkable-return-of-the-ibex/]</ref> After the establishment of the state, when hunting was outlawed and nature reserves were created in which they were protected, the ibex population rebounded. Three ibex populations have been discovered in Israel: in the [[Judean Desert]], the [[Negev]] mountains and [[Eilat]].<ref>[https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/science/.premium-conservation-saved-the-ibex-but-created-new-dangers-1.8292305 Conservation saved the ibex but created new dangers], [[Haaretz]]</ref>

==In popular culture==
The Biblical heroine [[Yael]]'s name means "Ibex" in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]. The Nubian ibex in particular was in the BBC documentary ''[[Life (BBC TV series)|Life]]'', and featured prominently in the popular television documentary series ''[[Planet Earth (2006 TV series)|Planet Earth]]'' (episode five, "Deserts").<ref>{{cite episode |title=Deserts |series=Planet Earth |credits=Produced by Huw Cordey |network=BBC |station=BBC One |airdate=2006-04-02}}</ref>
