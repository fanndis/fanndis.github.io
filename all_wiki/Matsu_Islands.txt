==History==

===Yuan Dynasty===
[[Mainland Chinese|Mainlander]]s from [[Fujian]] and [[Zhejiang]] started migrating to the islands during the [[Yuan Dynasty]]. Most of the people on Matsu came from Houguan ({{lang|zh|侯官}}) (today [[Changle District|Changle]], [[Fujian]]). The popular net fishing industry had established the base for development of Fuao settlement and industrial development of the region over several hundred years.

===Ming Dynasty===
Some crewmen of [[Zheng He]] temporarily stayed on the islands.

===Qing Dynasty===
[[File:Fujian quan tu LOC 96685903.jpg|thumb|Map of the historical Fujian Province including the Matsu Islands (1864)|left]]
During the early [[Qing Dynasty]], [[pirate]]s gathered here and the residents left temporarily. In contrast with [[Geography of Taiwan|Taiwan]] and [[Penghu]], the Matsu Islands were not ceded to the [[Japanese Empire]] via the [[Treaty of Shimonoseki]] in 1895. Neither were they occupied by Japanese troops  during [[World War II]] because they were not important militarily. Due to its strategic location for the only route for spice road, the [[British Empire|British]] established the [[Dongyong Lighthouse]] in [[Dongyin, Lienchiang|Dongyin Island]] in 1912 to facilitate ships navigation.<ref name="fkpg.gov.tw">{{Cite web |url=http://www.fkpg.gov.tw/Lienchiang.php |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-09-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924013546/http://www.fkpg.gov.tw/Lienchiang.php |archive-date=2015-09-24 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

===Republic of China===
In 1911, the Qing Dynasty was toppled after the [[Xinhai Revolution]] on 10 October 1911 and the [[Republic of China (1912–49)|Republic of China]] (ROC) was established on 1 January 1912. Matsu Islands was subsequently governed under the administration of [[Fujian Province, Republic of China|Fukien Province]] of the ROC. On 1 August 1927, the [[Nanchang Uprising]] broke out between the ruling [[Kuomintang|Nationalist Party of China]] (KMT) and [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC) which marked the beginning of [[Chinese Civil War]]. 

On 10 September 1937, Japan occupied Beigan and Nangan via the [[Collaborationist Chinese Army]], making the islands the first in Fujian to fall to Japan.<ref name="17to49">{{cite web|url=http://board.matsu.idv.tw/board_view.php?board=24&pid=23127&link=23127&start=0|script-title=zh:北竿鄉志 大事記（民國十七年至四十九年）|trans-title=History of Beigan Major Events (1928-1960)|language=zh-tw|website={{lang|zh-tw|馬祖資訊網}}|accessdate=2 September 2019|quote={{lang|zh-tw|二十六年<br />九月十日<br />北竿、南竿被日軍侵占，成為福建最早淪陷的島嶼。}}}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|script-title=zh:馬祖歲月印記|language=zh-tw|author={{lang|zh-tw|林金炎}}|quote={{lang|zh-tw|0910 日軍透過偽軍侵佔馬祖列島的南、北竿島，成為福建最早淪陷的島嶼。《連江縣志，大事紀P.34，連江縣地方志編纂委員會，2000.6，方志出版社。》}}|date=15 September 2014|page=46|isbn=978-986-90943-0-6}}</ref> The [[Surrender of Japan]] took place on August 15, 1945.

The KMT retreated from mainland China to Taiwan at the end of 1949. After their retreat, the KMT retained some of the offshore parts of Lienchiang County (namely, the Matsu Islands), and also most of [[Kinmen|Kinmen County]] (Quemoy).

The phrase "[[Kinmen|Quemoy]] and Matsu" became part of American political language in the [[1960 U.S. presidential election]]. During the debates, both candidates, Vice-President [[Richard Nixon]] and Senator [[John F. Kennedy]], pledged to use American forces if necessary to protect Taiwan from invasion by the PRC, which the United States did not recognize as a legitimate government. But in the second debate on October 7, 1960, the two candidates presented different opinions about whether to use American forces to protect [[Taiwan]]'s forward positions, Quemoy and Matsu, also.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://americandiplomacy.web.unc.edu/2010/11/quemoy-and-matsu/|title=A Historical Footnote Revisited|date=November 2010|author=Robert B.

(1962)]]
Then-Senator Kennedy responded to Morgan's question saying:
{{quotation|Well, the United States has on occasion attempted, mostly in the middle '50s to persuade [[Chiang Kai-shek]] to pull his troops back to Formosa. I believe strongly in the defense of Formosa. These islands are a few miles, five or six miles{{efn|[[Gaodeng Island]] is 5.75 miles from the Beijiao Peninsula. In Kinmen County, the northern coast of Greater Kinmen (Quemoy) is about five or six miles from the nearest point on mainland Asia in places. Some ROC-controlled areas are closer than five miles from PRC-controlled areas. For instance, Jiaoyu in [[Dadeng Subdistrict]] is a little more than one mile from the tip of Greater Kinmen in [[Jinsha, Kinmen|Jinsha Township]].}} off the coast of Red China within a general harbor area, and more than a hundred miles{{efn|[[Juguang, Lienchiang]] and [[Dongyin, Lienchiang]] are a little more than ninety miles from the closest point on the main island of Taiwan (Formosa), and [[Wuqiu, Kinmen]] is about eighty miles from the closest point. The main islands [[Nangan, Lienchiang|Nangan]] (Matsu) and [[Kinmen|Greater Kinmen]] (Quemoy) are over one hundred miles from Taiwan Island.}} from Formosa. We have never said flatly that we will defend Quemoy and Matsu if it is attacked. We say we will defend it if it's part of a general attack on Formosa, but it is extremely difficult to make that judgment.<br/>Now, Mr. [[Christian Herter|Herter]], in 1958, when he was [[United States Under Secretary of State|Under Secretary of State]], said they were strategically indefensible. Admiral [[Raymond A. Spruance|Spruance]] and [[J. Lawton Collins|Collins]] in 1955 said that we should not attempt to defend these islands in their conference on the Far East. General [[Matthew Ridgway|Ridgway]] has said the same thing. I believe that when you get into a war, if you're going to get into a war for the defense of Formosa, it ought to be on a clearly defined line. One of the problems, I think, at the time of South Korea was the question of whether the United States would defend it if it were attacked. I believe that we should defend Formosa, we should come to its defense. It leaves this rather in the air that we will defend it under some conditions but not under others, I think it is a mistake.<br/>Secondly, I would not suggest a withdrawal at the point of the Communist guns. It is a decision finally that the Nationalists should make and I believe that we should consult with them and attempt to work out a plan by which the line is drawn at the Island of Formosa. It leaves 100 miles{{efn|The island of Taiwan is separated from the southeast coast of [[China]] by the [[Taiwan Strait]], which ranges from {{convert|220|km|mi|sigfig=2|abbr=on}} at its widest point to {{convert|130|km|mi|sigfig=2|abbr=on}} at its narrowest.}} between the sea. But with General Ridgway, Mr. Herter, General Collins, Admiral Spruance and many others, I think it is unwise to take the chance of being dragged into a war which may lead to a world war over two islands which are not strategically defensible, which are not according to their testimony, essential to the defense of Formosa.<br/>I think that we should protect our commitments. I believe strongly we should do so in [[West Berlin|Berlin]]. I believe strongly we should do so in Formosa and I believe we should meet our commitments to every country whose security we've guaranteed. But I do not believe that that line, in case of a war, should be drawn on those islands, but instead on the island of Formosa. And as long as they are not essential to the defense of Formosa, it has been my judgement ever since 1954, at the time of the [[Eisenhower Doctrine]] for the Far East, that our line should be drawn in the sea around the island itself.}}

Then-Vice President Nixon retorted:
{{quotation|I disagree completely with Senator Kennedy on this point.<br/>I remember in the period immediately before the Korean War, South Korea was supposed to be indefensible as well. Generals testified to that, and Secretary [[Dean Acheson|Acheson]] made a very famous speech at the [[National Press Club (United States)|Press Club]] early in the year that the Korean War started, indicating in effect that South Korea was beyond the defense zone of the United States. I suppose it was hoped when he made that speech that we wouldn't get into a war, but it didn't mean that. We had to go in when they came in.<br/>Now I think as far as Quemoy and Matsu are concerned, that the question is not these two little pieces of real estate- they are unimportant. It isn't the few people who live on them- they are not too important. It's the principle involved. These two islands are in the area of freedom. The Nationalists have these two islands. We should not force our Nationalist allies to get off of them and give them to the Communists. If we do that, we start a chain reaction, because the Communists aren't after Quemoy and Matsu, they're after Formosa. In my opinion, this is the same kind of woolly thinking that lead to disaster for America in Korea, I'm against it, I would never tolerate it as President of the United States, and I will hope that Senator Kennedy will change his mind if he should be elected.}}

After the third debate on October 13, 1960, Kennedy's advisers spoke with then Secretary of State Herter and said Kennedy was willing to revise his position on the Quemoy and Matsu issue so as not to give the Communists the impression that the USA would not stand united against aggression. Nixon pointed out the change in Kennedy's position but decided not to press the point due to the importance of the USA's role in what was an extremely tense situation.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/memoirsofrichard00nixo|page=[https://archive.org/details/memoirsofrichard00nixo/page/272 272]|url-access=registration|publisher=Simon & Schuster|isbn=0-446-93259-0|title=RN: The Memoirs of Richard Nixon|author=[[Richard Nixon]]|date=1978|via=[[Internet Archive]]|quote=Once again I hit hard on the Quemoy-Matsu issue, stating that Kennedy's willingness to surrender the islands to the Communists under threat of war was no different from submitting to blackmail. Shortly after the third debate I learned that one of Kennedy's top foreign policy advisers had telephoned Secretary of State Herter to say that Kennedy did not want to give the Communists the impression that America would not stand united against aggression and was therefore prepared to revise his position in order not to appear to oppose the administration on this issue. I saw this as Kennedy's way of trying to slide away from an unpopular position, and my immediate inclination was not to let him get away with it. But the Quemoy-Matsu situation was so tense, and the importance of America's role in discouraging Communist aggression was so great, that I decided not to press the point if Kennedy modified his stand. I pointed out how his changed attitude reflected his lack of experience, and then let the issue drop.}}</ref> Nixon's polls among Republicans and Democrats showed overwhelming support for Nixon's position.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/jfkmanmyth00lask|page=[https://archive.org/details/jfkmanmyth00lask/page/444 444]|date=1963|author=[[Victor Lasky]]|title=J.F.K. : the man and the myth|via=[[Internet Archive]]}}</ref>

==Demographics and culture==
[[File:Magang Mazu Temple, Nangan, Matsu, Taiwan.JPG|thumb|Matsu Nangan Tianhou Temple]]

===Population===
The majority of native Matsu Islands residents originated from Northern Fujian. Several of the islands of Matsu are not inhabited permanently. Some of these are garrisoned by soldiers from the [[Republic of China Armed Forces]] stationed in the county since the end of [[Chinese Civil War]] in 1949 and during the [[First Taiwan Strait Crisis|First]] and [[Second Taiwan Strait Crisis]] in 1954 and 1958 respectively. Due to that high military demand  large numbers of military personnel stationed on the islands produced unprecedented population growth in the county. The population reached its peak in 1971 with a total of 17,088 people. After those period of high growth the population decreased year after year due to the poor economic growth which resulted in mass youth emigration due to lack of employment opportunities. In recent years the population in the county has gradually increased because of immigration. The population has stabilized and become stable due to the improved transportation between Taiwan Island and Matsu Islands as well as mass construction projects.<ref name="fkpg.gov.tw"/>

===Languages===
The native language spoken by Matsu residents is [[Matsu dialect]], a subdialect of [[Fuzhou dialect]], which is one of the statutory languages for public transport announcements in the Matsu Islands.<ref name="大眾運輸工具播音語言平等保障法">[[:s:zh:大眾運輸工具播音語言平等保障法|大眾運輸工具播音語言平等保障法]]</ref><ref name="roughguides.com"/> [[Mandarin Chinese]] is one of the official languages of Lienchiang County.

===Name===
[[Chen (surname)|Chen]] (陳) is the most common [[Chinese surname|surname]], then [[Lin (surname)|Lin]] (林), [[Wang (surname)|Wang]] (王), [[Cao (Chinese surname)|Tsao]] (曹) and [[Liu]] (劉).

===Belief===
Matsu, though named after the goddess [[Matsu (goddess)|Matsu]], is written with a different character that has a different tone. But the Matsu Islands are not the birthplace of the goddess as the human Lin Muoniang - [[Meizhou Island]] is — but her death place (on a seaport named after her on Nangan Island).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.matsu-nsa.gov.tw/User/Article.aspx?a=22&l=2 |title=History and customs |publisher=Matsu National Scenic Area |accessdate=February 8, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720150440/http://www.matsu-nsa.gov.tw/User/Article.aspx?a=22&l=2 |archive-date=July 20, 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref>

The Matsu Nangan Tianhou Temple ({{lang|zh-hant|馬祖南竿天后宮}}), a temple dedicated to the goddess, contains the sarcophagus of Lin Muoniang. It is, however, not as popular as the Meizhou temple.

Most Taiwanese pilgrims to Meizhou start off their journey in the Matsu Islands because they are the closest ROC-controlled territory to Meizhou, which is controlled by the PRC.

==Economy==
[[File:Vegetable Farming Park, Nangan, Matsu, Taiwan.JPG|thumb|[[Shanlong Vegetable Park|Vegetable farming park]] in Nangan Township]]

Due to its geographically remote location, the manufacturing business of Matsu has never been fully developed. Among them, the wine making industry of [[Matsu Distillery]] is the most distinguished feature. Tourism and service businesses are still not prominent.

However, most of its commercial tradings focus on retail businesses and restaurants for stationed military consumption. Farm products of Matsu include [[rice]], [[sugar cane]], [[tea plant]], [[Orange (fruit)|orange]]. Sea animals, such as [[fish]], [[clam]]s, and [[jellyfish]], are also popular exports due to its nature as the major traditional industry in Matsu. However, the flourish of fishing ground is almost exhausted by arbitrary fish bombing by Mainland China fishing boats, while the population of fishes is decreasing as well.<ref name="fkpg.gov.tw"/>

In July 2012, Matsu residents voted in favor for the establishment of [[casino]]s, which led the path of the prospect gaming industries in the county and the passing on of Gaming Act ({{zh|c=觀光賭場管理條例}}).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2012/07/08/2003537221/1|title=Matsu votes to allow building of casino|publisher=|access-date=2014-09-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150102140259/http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2012/07/08/2003537221/1|archive-date=2015-01-02|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Energy and environment==
[[File:協和發電廠珠山分廠.jpg|thumb|[[Zhushan Power Plant]]]]

===Power generation===
The islands are powered up by their fuel-fired (diesel) [[Zhushan Power Plant]] located in Cingshuei Village of [[Nangan, Lienchiang|Nangan Township]] with a capacity of 15.4 MW commissioned on 22 March 2010. The other power plant is Xiju Power Plant in Xiju Island of [[Juguang, Lienchiang|Juguang Township]].

===Pollution===
Generally, the environment of Matsu Islands is still good. The major source of pollution is from family and military households waste. There are however concerns that the continued lack of modern sewage facilities results in household waste seeping into groundwater.<ref name="fkpg.gov.tw"/>

==Tourism==

One of the most promising resources for local economy is tourism.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} Lienchiang County Government is making an effort to attract more visitors to the Matsu Islands, especially among foreigners.<ref>{{cite news |title=Matsu Island opens doors to tourists |url=http://taiwantoday.tw/ct.asp?xItem=97102&ctNode=413 |newspaper=Taiwan Today |date=March 3, 2010 |accessdate=February 8, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111009014216/http://taiwantoday.tw/ct.asp?xItem=97102&ctNode=413 |archive-date=October 9, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Matsu islands aim to attract more overseas tourists |url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2010/08/29/2003481579 |newspaper=Taipei Times |date=August 29, 2010 |accessdate=February 8, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100902174748/http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2010/08/29/2003481579 |archive-date=September 2, 2010 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Nangan is the capital of Matsu and it is noted for its granite tunnel and the Iron Fort. It has two interconnected main roads.

The Beihai Tunnels are manmade granite tunnels. Both tunnels were remarkable for their time, and they took great effort to construct. The [[Beihai Tunnel (Nangan)|tunnel in Nangan]] was built in 1968. The completion of Beihai Tunnel took the effort of thousands of men. The 700 metre (800 yard) tunnel has a width of 10 metres (33') and a height of 16 metres (52'). It was completed in 820 days with shovels, spades and explosives; the tunnel also took the life of a platoon of soldiers. The tunnel was considered a military location and was not opened to the public until 1990.

The Iron Fort is located on the Southwest side of Nangan island.  Located by a small cliff, it is a vulnerable spot for outside attacks or illegal smuggling of materials. With that in mind, the fort was built for defence. It is equipped with multiple machinegun rooms and rudimentary living facilities. It is now open to the public, and although most of the equipment has been removed from the site, the site itself brings back a vivid image of what it was like for soldiers at that time.

Museums in Matsu including the [[Matsu Folk Culture Museum]], [[Ching-kuo Memorial Hall]] and [[War and Peace Memorial Park Exhibition Center]].

===Nature===
Since 1990, the county manages the {{ill|Matsu Islands Bird Sanctuary|zh|馬祖列島燕鷗保護區}}, which spreads across eight islands and islets in Nangan, Beigan and Tongyin Townships.  It contains 30 [[species (biology)|species]] in 15 [[order (biology)|orders]], mostly [[gulls]] and [[terns]]. In 2000, four pairs of the [[endangered species|critically endangered]] [[Chinese crested tern]], previously thought to be [[extinct species|extinct]], were discovered nesting on the Matsu Islands, giving them global conservation importance.

There are also [[moss]]es and [[fern]]s rare or absent elsewhere in the [[Republic of China|ROC]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.matsu-nsa.gov.tw/User/Article.aspx?a=25&l=2 |title=Climate, Flora and fauna |publisher=Matsu National Scenic Area |accessdate=February 8, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720150144/http://www.matsu-nsa.gov.tw/User/Article.aspx?a=25&l=2 |archive-date=July 20, 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref>

==Transportation==
[[File:Nangan Airport, Nangan, Matsu, Taiwan.JPG|thumb|[[Matsu Nangan Airport]]]]
[[File:Fuao Harbor, Nangan, Matsu, Taiwan.JPG|thumb|Fuao Harbor]]

===Air===
Both [[Nangan, Lienchiang|Nangan]] and [[Beigan, Lienchiang|Beigan]] have airports which are the [[Matsu Nangan Airport]] and [[Matsu Beigan Airport]] respectively. [[Dongyin, Lienchiang|Dongyin]] and [[Juguang, Lienchiang|Juguang]] (in Xiju Island) house heliports which only operates during winter time and priority is given to local residents to travel to [[Nangan, Lienchiang|Nangan]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.matsu-nsa.gov.tw/user/Article.aspx?a=129&l=2|title=Island to Island Transport - Matsu National Scenic Area|publisher=|access-date=2014-09-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140911002022/http://www.matsu-nsa.gov.tw/user/Article.aspx?a=129&l=2|archive-date=2014-09-11|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Sea===
Due to the fact that the main airport is located in Nangan, boats are the main form of transportation between the islands in the county.

There are two ferry rides to Mainland China. One arrives at [[Mawei District]] of [[Fuzhou]] and departs from Fuao Harbor at [[Nangan, Lienchiang|Nangan Township]] in which the journey normally takes 90 minutes while in Nangan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.matsu-nsa.gov.tw/user/Article.aspx?a=505&l=2|title=Three Mini-Links - Matsu National Scenic Area|publisher=|access-date=2014-09-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150102144817/http://www.matsu-nsa.gov.tw/user/Article.aspx?a=505&l=2|archive-date=2015-01-02|url-status=live}}</ref> Another arrives at [[Huangqi, Lianjiang County|Huangqi]] ({{lang|zh-hans|黄岐镇}}) of [[Lianjiang County|Lianjiang]] and departs from [[Beigan, Lienchiang|Beigan Township]] in which the journey takes only 20 minutes.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.chinapost.com.tw/taiwan/china-taiwan-relations/2015/05/11/435733/New-Matsu-Fujian.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-10-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151022090633/http://www.chinapost.com.tw/taiwan/china-taiwan-relations/2015/05/11/435733/New-Matsu-Fujian.htm |archive-date=2015-10-22 |url-status=live }}</ref> [[Dongyin, Lienchiang|Dongyin Township]] houses the [[Zhongzhu Harbor]].

===Road===
Due to their size, travelling by motorized scooter is an ideal way to get around the main islands such as Nangan and Beigan. Both Islands have regular buses and taxis are also economical. In October 2019, Mainland China announced 'initial plans' to build a bridge linking [[Fuzhou]] to the Matsu Islands. Taiwan’s [[Mainland Affairs Council]] (MAC) said that the plans were made unilaterally by China as part of its schemes to absorb Taiwan and divide Taiwanese society and that they see no need for bridges linking either Matsu or [[Kinmen]] to China.<ref>{{cite news|first1=Pei-ju|last1=Teng|date=14 October 2019|url=https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3795498|title=China announces 'initial plans' to build bridges to Taiwan's outlying islands Matsu, Kinmen|publisher=Taiwan News|accessdate=15 October 2019|quote=A Chinese state-run news channel reported on Sunday (Oct. 13) that Beijing has completed "initial plans" for bridges linking the country to Taiwan’s outlying islands Matsu and Kinmen. Taiwan’s Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) said on Monday that the plans were made unilaterally by China as part of its schemes to absorb Taiwan and divide Taiwanese society, reported Liberty Times. Beijing has long disregarded the existence of Taiwan and shown a lack of respect for its democratic values and system, the MAC said.{...}According to Communist China’s mouthpiece CCTV, a total of 40 experts from both sides of the Taiwan Strait gathered in Fujian’s provincial capital, Fuzhou, on Sunday to discuss plans for the bridges connecting Fuzhou to Matsu and Xiamen to Kinmen. }}</ref>
