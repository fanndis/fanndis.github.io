The '''Center for Reproductive Rights''' '''(CRR)''' is a global legal [[Advocacy group|advocacy organization]] that seeks to advance [[reproductive rights]], such as [[abortion]]. The organization's stated mission is to "use the law to advance reproductive freedom as a fundamental human right that all governments are legally obligated to protect, respect, and fulfill."<ref>{{cite web|title=About Us|url=http://www.reproductiverights.org/about-us|publisher=Center for Reproductive Rights|accessdate=15 September 2016}}</ref> Founded by [[Janet Benshoof]] in 1992, its original name was the Center for Reproductive Law and Policy.<ref name= publiclives>{{cite news|last1=Wadler|first1=Joyce|title=Public Lives: Defending the Defenders of Abortion Rights|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/11/04/nyregion/public-lives-defending-the-defenders-of-abortion-rights.html|accessdate=2 March 2016|publisher=The New York Times|date=November 4, 1998}}</ref>

==History==
In July 2011, the CRR filed suit against the state of North Dakota over a state law that would ban all medical abortions.<ref>{{cite press release | url=http://reproductiverights.org/en/press-room/center-for-reproductive-rights-takes-legal-action-to-block-north-dakota-attack-on-women%E2%80%99s | title=Center for Reproductive Rights takes legal action to block North Dakota attack on women’s health, abortion rights | publisher=CRR | date=18 July 2011 | accessdate=18 September 2013 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130423151117/http://reproductiverights.org/en/press-room/center-for-reproductive-rights-takes-legal-action-to-block-north-dakota-attack-on-women%E2%80%99s | archivedate=23 April 2013 }}</ref> In July 2013, the CRR, along with the [[Red River Women's Clinic]], filed a lawsuit against the enactment of fetal heartbeat, genetic, and sex selection restrictions on abortions.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/26/us/lawsuit-challenges-north-dakotas-abortion-limits.html?_r=0 | title=Lawsuit Challenges North Dakota’s Abortion Limits | publisher=The New York Times | date=25 June 2013 | accessdate=18 September 2013 | author=Eckholm.

Dakota Abortion Lawsuit | publisher=ABC News | date=11 September 2013 | accessdate=18 September 2013 | author=MacPherson, James}}</ref>

In 2011 the CRR joined with the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU) and [[Planned Parenthood]] to challenge a law passed which requires women to get an ultrasound four hours before an abortion. In addition, it requires the doctor to put the ultrasound image within the view of the woman and describe it. The plaintiffs have called it an "ideological message," and a violation of the First Amendment. And since the patient is not actually required to listen to what the doctor describes and can even choose to wear blinders and headphones, the plaintiffs went on to call it a "farce."<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.news-record.com/news/article_03c9f696-0bf1-11e3-aaa2-001a4bcf6878.html | title=Update: Ruling on ultrasounds still ‘several weeks’ off | publisher=News & Record | date=29 August 2013 | accessdate=29 August 2013 | author=Lopez, Robert}}</ref>

After suing the Obama administration over the restricted access to [[emergency contraception|birth control]], in June 2013 the U.S. Department of Justice ordered that the Obama administration make all forms of emergency contraception available over the counter and without an age restriction.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.motherjones.com/mojo/2013/06/obama-administration-plan-b-one-step-over-counter | title=Buying Plan B Will No Longer Require an ID or a Prescription | publisher=Mother Jones | date=10 June 2013 | accessdate=2 August 2013 | author=Sheppard, Kate}}</ref>

In recent years, CRR has been one of three primary groups challenging increased state level restrictions to reproductive health and abortion care.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.motherjones.com/mojo/2013/06/nancy-northup-abortion-franks-supreme-court | title=Republicans Want to Ban Abortions After 20 Weeks.

In November 2015, the [[United States Supreme Court]] agreed to review stringent restrictions enacted into law by abortion opponents in Texas.  Upon coming into force the laws would leave Texas, a state with a population of 27 million, served by only ten clinics, 34 less than the number in service before the laws were enacted.  The appeal, handled by the CRR, is U.S. Supreme Court docket number 16-274, ''[[Whole Woman's Health v. Cole]].''  It is the first case that the high court has accepted scrutinizing abortion restriction since 2007.<ref>[https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/11/13/us-usa-court-abortion-idUSKCN0T229F20151113 Supreme court to decide major abortion case for first time since 2007] Lawrence Hurley reporting in [[Reuters]] Fri Nov 13, 2015</ref>

In 2016 the CRR expanded its international program, including the launch of an international litigation campaign that has included the first [[abortion]] case decided by the [[United Nations]] Human Rights Committee and the first case to frame preventable maternal deaths as a [[human rights]] violation.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/xx_factor/2016/12/01/ireland_will_pay_damages_to_a_woman_forced_to_travel_abroad_for_an_abortion.html|title=Ireland Will Pay Damages to a Woman Forced to Travel Abroad for an Abortion|last=Cauterucci|first=Christina|date=2016-12-01|newspaper=Slate|language=en-US|issn=1091-2339|access-date=2016-12-10}}</ref>
