A '''social networking service''' (also '''social networking site''' or '''social media''') is an online platform which people use to build social networks or [[social relation]]ships with other people who share similar personal or career interests, activities, backgrounds or real-life connections.<ref name="Obar & Wildman 2015"/><ref name="Boyd & Ellison 2007"/>

Social networking services vary in format and the number of features. They can incorporate a range of new information and communication tools, operating on [[desktop computer|desktop]]s and on [[laptop]]s, on mobile devices such as [[tablet computer]]s and [[smartphone]]s. They may feature digital photo/video/sharing and diary entries online (blogging).<ref name="Boyd & Ellison 2007">{{cite journal |last1=Boyd |first1=Danah M. |last2=Ellison |first2=Nicole B. |title=Social Network Sites: Definition, History, and Scholarship |journal=Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication |date=October 2007 |volume=13 |issue=1 |pages=210–230 |doi=10.1111/j.1083-6101.2007.00393.x |s2cid=52810295 }}</ref> [[Online community]] services are sometimes considered social-network services by developers and users, though in a broader sense, a social-network service usually provides an individual-centered service whereas online community services are group-centered. Defined as "websites that facilitate the building of a network of contacts in order to exchange various types of content online," social networking sites provide a space for interaction to continue beyond in person interactions. These computer mediated interactions link members of various networks and may help to both maintain and develop new social and professional relationships <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Mlaïki |first1=Alya |last2=Walsh |first2=Isabelle |last3=Kalika |first3=Michel |title=Why Do We Continue Using Social Networking Sites?

Social networking sites allow users to share ideas, digital photos and videos, posts, and to inform others about online or real-world activities and events with people in their network. While in-person social networking – such as gathering in a village market to talk about events – has existed since the earliest development of towns,<ref>{{Citation|last=Joseph|first=R.|title=The Naked Neuron|chapter=Touch Me—Feel Me—Feed Me— Kiss Me!|date=1993|pages=71–98|publisher=Springer US|isbn=978-0-306-44510-1|doi=10.1007/978-1-4899-6008-5_4}}</ref> the web enables people to connect with others who live in different locations, ranging from across a city to across the world. Depending on the [[social media]] platform, members may be able to contact any other member. In other cases, members can contact anyone they have a connection to, and subsequently anyone that contact has a connection to, and so on. The success of social networking services can be seen in their dominance in society today, with Facebook having a massive 2.13&nbsp;billion active monthly users and an average of 1.4&nbsp;billion [[daily active users]] in 2017.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://newsroom.fb.com/company-info/ |title=Company Info |publisher=Facebook Newsroom |access-date=April 12, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151115110456/https://newsroom.fb.com/company-info/ |archive-date=November 15, 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref> [[LinkedIn]], a career-oriented social-networking service, generally requires that a member personally know another member in [[real life]] before they contact them online. Some services require members to have a preexisting connection to contact other members.

The main types of social networking services contain [[Psychographics|category places]] (such as age or occupation or religion), means to connect with friends (usually with self-description pages), and a recommendation system linked to trust. One can categorize social-network services into four types:<ref>{{cite book |doi=10.1016/S0065-2458(09)01002-X |chapter=Chapter 2 Social Network Sites |title=Social Networking and the Web |volume=76 |pages=19–73 |series=Advances in Computers |year=2009 |last1=Thelwall |first1=Mike |isbn=9780123748119 }}</ref>

* socializing social network services used primarily for socializing with existing friends (e.g., [[Facebook]])
*online social networks are decentralized and distributed computer networks where users communicate with each other through internet services.
* networking social network services used primarily for non-social interpersonal communication (e.g., [[LinkedIn]], a career- and employment-oriented site)
* [[social navigation]] social network services used primarily for helping users to find specific information or resources (e.g., [[Goodreads]] for books)

There have been attempts to standardize these services to avoid the need to duplicate entries of friends and interests (see the [[FOAF (software)|FOAF]] standard). A study reveals that [[India]] recorded world's largest growth in terms of social media users in 2013.<ref>{{cite news

==Definition==
There is a variety of social networking services available online. However, most incorporate common features:<ref name="Obar & Wildman 2015">{{cite journal |last1=Obar |first1=Jonathan A. |last2=Wildman |first2=Steve |title=Social media definition and the governance challenge: An introduction to the special issue |journal=Telecommunications Policy |date=October 2015 |volume=39 |issue=9 |pages=745–750 |doi=10.1016/j.telpol.2015.07.014 |ssrn=2647377 }}</ref>

===A challenge of definition===
The variety and evolving range of stand-alone and built-in social networking services in the online space introduces a challenge of definition.<ref name="Obar & Wildman 2015"/> Furthermore, the idea that these services are defined by their ability to bring people together and  provides too broad a definition. Such a broad definition would suggest that the [[telegraph]] and [[telephone]] were social networking services – not the Internet technologies scholars are intending to describe.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Schejter |first1=Amit M. |last2=Tirosh |first2=Noam |title='Seek the meek, seek the just': Social media and social justice |journal=Telecommunications Policy |date=October 2015 |volume=39 |issue=9 |pages=796–803 |doi=10.1016/j.telpol.2015.08.002 }}</ref> The terminology is also unclear, with some referring to social networking services as [[social media]].<ref name="Boyd & Ellison 2007"/>

===Attempting definition===
A recent attempt<ref name="Obar & Wildman 2015"/> at providing a clear definition reviewed the prominent literature in the area and identified four commonalities unique to current social networking services:

::(1) social networking services are interactive [[Web 2.0]] Internet-based applications,<ref name="Obar & Wildman 2015"/><ref name="Kaplan & Haenlein 2010"/>
::(2) [[user-generated content]] (UGC), such as user-submitted [[digital photo]]s, text posts, "tagging", online comments, and diary-style "web logs" ([[blog]]s), is the lifeblood of the SNS organism,<ref name="Obar & Wildman 2015"/><ref name="Kaplan & Haenlein 2010"/>
::(3) users create service-specific profiles for the site or app that are designed and maintained by the SNS organization,<ref name="Obar & Wildman 2015"/><ref name="Boyd & Ellison 2007"/> and
::(4) social networking services facilitate the development of [[social network]]s online  by connecting a user's profile with those of other individuals or groups.<ref name="Obar & Wildman 2015"/><ref name="Boyd & Ellison 2007"/>

The potential for computer networking to facilitate newly improved forms of computer-mediated social interaction was suggested early on.<ref>''The Network Nation 2'' by S. Roxanne Hiltz and Murray Turoff (Addison-Wesley, 1978, 1993)</ref> Efforts to support social networks via [[computer-mediated communication]] were made in many early online services, including [[Usenet]],<ref>[[Michael Hauben]], [[Ronda Hauben]], and [[Thomas Truscott]] (April 27, 1997). Netizens: On the History and Impact of Usenet and the Internet (Perspectives). Wiley-IEEE Computer Society P. {{ISBN|0-8186-7706-6}}{{page needed|date=November 2019}}</ref> [[ARPANET]], [[LISTSERV]], and bulletin board services ([[Bulletin board system|BBS]]). Many prototypical features of social networking sites were also present in online services such as [[America Online]], [[Prodigy (online service)|Prodigy]], [[CompuServe]], [[ChatNet]], and The WELL.<ref>[[Katie Hafner]], The WELL: A Story of Love, Death and Real Life in the Seminal Online Community (2001) Carroll & Graf Publishers {{ISBN|0-7867-0846-8}}{{page needed|date=November 2019}}</ref>

Early social networking on the [[World Wide Web]] began in the form of generalized online communities such as [[Theglobe.com]] (1995),<ref>{{cite journal| last=Cotriss| first=David| date=May 29, 2008| title=Where are they now: TheGlobe.com| journal=The Industry Standard| url=http://www.thestandard.com/news/2008/05/29/where-are-they-now-theglobe-com| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090204085711/http://thestandard.com/news/2008/05/29/where-are-they-now-theglobe-com| archive-date=February 4, 2009}}</ref> [[Geocities]] (1994) and [[Tripod.com]] (1995). Many of these early communities focused on bringing people together to interact with each other through chat rooms and encouraged users to share personal information and ideas via personal web pages by providing easy-to-use publishing tools and free or inexpensive web space. Some communities – such as [[Classmates.com]] – took a different approach by simply having people link to each other via email addresses. [[PlanetAll]] started in 1996.

In the late 1990s, [[user profile]]s became a central feature of social networking sites, allowing users to compile lists of "[[friending|friends]]" and search for other users with similar interests. New social networking methods were developed by the end of the 1990s, and many sites began to develop more advanced features for users to find and manage friends.<ref>Romm-Livermore, C. & Setzekorn, K.

Research has provided us with mixed results as to whether or not a person's involvement in social networking can affect their feelings of [[loneliness]]. Studies have indicated that how a person chooses to use social networking can change their feelings of loneliness in either a negative or positive way.

==Features==
===Typical features===
According to Boyd and Ellison's (2007) article, "Why Youth (Heart) Social Network Sites: The Role of Networked Publics in Teenage Social Life", social networking sites share a variety of technical features that allow individuals to: construct a public/semi-public profile, articulate a list of other users that they share a connection with, and view their list of connections within the system. The most basic of these are visible profiles with a list of "friends" who are also users of the site.<ref name=Boyd2007/> In an article entitled "Social Network Sites: Definition, History, and Scholarship," Boyd and Ellison adopt Sunden's (2003) description of profiles as unique pages where one can "type oneself into being".<ref name="Boyd & Ellison 2007"/> A profile is generated from answers to questions, such as age, location, interests, etc. Some sites allow users to upload pictures, add multimedia content or modify the look and feel of the profile. Others, e.g., Facebook, allow users to enhance their profile by adding modules or "Applications".<ref name="Boyd & Ellison 2007"/> Many sites allow users to post blog entries, search for others with similar interests and compile and share lists of contacts. User profiles often have a section dedicated to comments from friends and other users. To protect user privacy, social networks typically have controls that allow users to choose who can view their profile, contact them, add them to their list of contacts, and so on.

===Additional features===
There is a trend towards more [[Social network aggregation|interoperability between social networks]] led by technologies such as [[OpenID]] and [[OpenSocial]]. In most mobile communities, mobile phone users can now create their own profiles, make friends, participate in chat rooms, create chat rooms, hold private conversations, share photos and videos, and share blogs by using their mobile phone. Some companies provide wireless services that allow their customers to build their own mobile community and brand it; one of the most popular wireless services for social networking in [[North America]] and [[Nepal]] is Facebook Mobile.
Recently, twitter has also introduced fact check labels to combat misinformation which was primarily spread due to the coronavirus but also has had an impact on debunking false claims by Donald Trump in the 2020 election

Real-time allows users to contribute contents, which is then broadcast as it is being uploaded—the concept is analogous to live radio and television broadcasts. [[Twitter]] set the trend for "real-time" services, wherein users can broadcast to the world what they are doing, or what is on their minds within a 140-character limit. [[Facebook]] followed suit with their "Live Feed" where users' activities are streamed as soon as it happens. While Twitter focuses on words, [[Clixtr]], another real-time service, focuses on group photo sharing wherein users can update their photo streams with photos while at an event. Facebook, however, remains the largest photo sharing site—Facebook application and photo aggregator Pixable estimates that Facebook will have 100&nbsp;billion photos by Summer 2012.<ref>{{cite web|author=Sarah Kessler|url=http://mashable.com/2011/02/14/facebook-photo-infographic/?asid=c228f21b|title=Facebook Photos By the Numbers [INFOGRAPHIC]|publisher=[[Mashable]]|date=February 14, 2011|access-date=August 7, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130520110731/http://mashable.com/2011/02/14/facebook-photo-infographic/?asid=c228f21b|archive-date=May 20, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> In April 2012, the image-based social media network [[Pinterest]] had become the third largest social network in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mashable.com/2012/04/06/pinterest-number-3-social-network/|title=Pinterest is Now the No. 3 Social Network in the U.S. [STUDY]|first=Todd|last=Wasserman|access-date=September 7, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120809161431/http://mashable.com/2012/04/06/pinterest-number-3-social-network/|archive-date=August 9, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>

Companies have begun to merge business technologies and solutions, such as [[cloud computing]], with social networking concepts. Instead of connecting individuals based on social interest, companies are developing interactive communities that connect individuals based on shared business needs or experiences. Many provide specialized networking tools and [[Application software|applications]] that can be accessed via their websites, such as [[LinkedIn]]. Others companies, such as [[Monster.com]], have been steadily developing a more "socialized" feel to their career center sites to harness some of the power of social networking sites. These more business related sites have their own nomenclature for the most part but the most common naming conventions are "Vocational Networking Sites" or "Vocational Media Networks", with the former more closely tied to individual networking relationships based on social networking principles.

[[Foursquare (service)|Foursquare]] gained popularity as it allowed for users to check into places that they are frequenting at that moment. [[Gowalla]] is another such service that functions in much the same way that Foursquare does, leveraging the [[GPS]] in phones to create a location-based user experience. Clixtr, though in the real-time space, is also a location-based social networking site, since events created by users are automatically geotagged, and users can view events occurring nearby through the Clixtr [[iPhone]] app. Recently, [[Yelp, Inc.|Yelp]] announced its entrance into the location-based social networking space through check-ins with their mobile app; whether or not this becomes detrimental to Foursquare or Gowalla is yet to be seen, as it is still considered a new space in the Internet technology industry.<ref>{{cite web |author=MG Siegler |url=https://techcrunch.com/2010/01/15/yelp-iphone-app-4-check-ins/ |title=Yelp Enables Check-Ins On Its iPhone App; Foursquare, Gowalla Ousted As Mayors |publisher=Techcrunch.com |date=January 15, 2010 |access-date=March 13, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110307064639/http://techcrunch.com/2010/01/15/yelp-iphone-app-4-check-ins/ |archive-date=March 7, 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref>

One popular use for this new technology is social networking between businesses. Companies have found that social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter are great ways to build their brand image. According to Jody Nimetz, author of Marketing Jive,<ref name="marketing-jive.com">Nimetz, Jody. [http://www.marketing-jive.com/2007/11/jody-nimetz-on-emerging-trends-in-b2b.html "Jody Nimetz on Emerging Trends in B2B Social Networking"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110311231207/http://www.marketing-jive.com/2007/11/jody-nimetz-on-emerging-trends-in-b2b.html |date=March 11, 2011 }}. Marketing-Jive, November 18, 2007. Retrieved October 26, 2009.</ref> there are five major uses for businesses and social media: to create brand awareness, as an online [[reputation management]] tool, for recruiting, to learn about new technologies and competitors, and as a [[lead generation]] tool to intercept potential prospects.<ref name="marketing-jive.com"/> These companies are able to drive traffic to their own online sites while encouraging their consumers and clients to have discussions on how to improve or change products or services. As of September 2013, 71% of online adults use Facebook, 17% use Instagram, 21% use Pinterest, and 22% use LinkedIn.<ref>{{cite web|date=Oct 23, 2014|title=Social Networking Fact Sheet|publisher=[[Pew Research]]|url=http://www.pewinternet.org/fact-sheets/social-networking-fact-sheet/|access-date=October 24, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141024021318/http://www.pewinternet.org/fact-sheets/social-networking-fact-sheet/|archive-date=October 24, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Niche networks===
In 2012, it was reported that in the past few years, the niche social network has steadily grown in popularity, thanks to better levels of user interaction and engagement. In 2012, a survey by Reuters and research firm Ipsos<ref>{{cite news|date=Jan 4, 2012|title=Facebook comments, ads don't sway most users|newspaper=[[Reuters]]|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/06/05/net-us-facebook-survey-idUSBRE85400C20120605/|access-date=July 2, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151011005908/http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/06/05/net-us-facebook-survey-idUSBRE85400C20120605|archive-date=October 11, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>
found that one in three users were getting bored with Facebook and in 2014 the GlobalWebIndex found that this figured had risen to almost 50%. The niche social network offers a specialized space that's designed to appeal to a very specific market with a clearly defined set of needs. Where once the streams of social minutia on networks such as Facebook and Twitter were the ultimate in online voyeurism, now users are looking for connections, community and shared experiences. Social networks that tap directly into specific activities, hobbies, tastes, and lifestyles are seeing a consistent rise in popularity.

===Science===
One other use that is being discussed is the use of social networks in the science communities. Julia Porter Liebeskind et al. have published a study on how new biotechnology firms are using social networking sites to share exchanges in scientific knowledge.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Liebeskind |first1=Julia Porter |last2=Oliver |first2=Amalya Lumerman |last3=Zucker |first3=Lynne |last4=Brewer |first4=Marilynn |title=Social Networks, Learning, and Flexibility: Sourcing Scientific Knowledge in New Biotechnology Firms |journal=Organization Science |date=1996 |volume=7 |issue=4 |pages=428–443 |jstor=2635102 |doi=10.1287/orsc.7.4.428 |s2cid=166857575 |url=https://escholarship.org/uc/item/4480h6s7 |access-date=November 17, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200106215252/https://escholarship.org/uc/item/4480h6s7 |archive-date=January 6, 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref> They state in their study that by sharing information and knowledge with one another, they are able to "increase both their learning and their flexibility in ways that would not have been possible within a self-contained hierarchical organization". Social networking is allowing scientific groups to expand their knowledge base and share ideas, and without these new means of communicating their theories might become "isolated and irrelevant". Researchers use social networks frequently to maintain and develop professional relationships.<ref>{{cite web|last=Bianchini|first=Laurence|title=Social Networks for Scientists|url=https://www.mysciencework.com/news/6400/social-networks-for-scientists|publisher=MyScienceWork|access-date=April 22, 2014|date=May 14, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222153911/http://www.mysciencework.com/news/6400/social-networks-for-scientists|archive-date=February 22, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> They are interested in consolidating social ties and professional contact, keeping in touch with friends and colleagues and seeing what their own contacts are doing. This can be related to their need to keep updated on the activities and events of their friends and colleagues in order to establish collaborations on common fields of interest and knowledge sharing.<ref name="Ferri F. 2012 pp. 121-137">{{cite journal |last1=Ferri |first1=Fernando |last2=Grifoni |first2=Patrizia |last3=Guzzo |first3=Tiziana |title=New forms of social and professional digital relationships: the case of Facebook |journal=Social Network Analysis and Mining |date=20 September 2011 |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=121–137 |doi=10.1007/s13278-011-0038-4 |s2cid=15925282 }}</ref>

Social networks are also used to communicate scientists research results<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Van Eperen |first1=Laura |last2=Marincola |first2=Francesco M |title=How scientists use social media to communicate their research |journal=Journal of Translational Medicine |date=15 November 2011 |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=199 |doi=10.1186/1479-5876-9-199 |pmid=22085450 |pmc=3231985 }}</ref> and as a public communication tool and to connect people who share the same professional interests, their benefits can vary according to the discipline.<ref>{{cite web |last=Bianchini |first=Laurence |url=http://www.mysciencework.com/news/7045/scientific-social-networks-different-approaches-for-different-disciplines |title=Scientific Social Networks: Different Approaches for Different Disciplines |work=MyScienceWork |date=July 4, 2012 |access-date=October 17, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150703061620/https://www.mysciencework.com/news/7045/scientific-social-networks-different-approaches-for-different-disciplines |archive-date=July 3, 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref> The most interesting aspects of social networks for professional purposes are their potentialities in terms of dissemination of information and the ability to reach and multiple professional contacts exponentially. Social networks like [[Academia.edu]], [[LinkedIn]], [[Facebook]], and [[ResearchGate]] give the possibility to join professional groups and pages, to share papers and results, publicize events, to discuss issues and create debates.<ref name="Ferri F. 2012 pp. 121-137"/> Academia.edu is extensively used by researchers, where they follow a combination of social networking and scholarly norms.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Thelwall |first1=Mike |last2=Kousha |first2=Kayvan |title=Academia.edu: Social network or Academic Network? |journal=Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology |date=April 2014 |volume=65 |issue=4 |pages=721–731 |doi=10.1002/asi.23038 |hdl=2436/621523 |s2cid=37382952 |url=http://www.scit.wlv.ac.uk/~cm1993/papers/Academia_preprint.pdf |access-date=September 24, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190710220231/http://www.scit.wlv.ac.uk/~cm1993/papers/Academia_preprint.pdf |archive-date=July 10, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> ResearchGate is also widely used by researchers, especially to disseminate and discuss their publications,<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Thelwall |first1=Mike |last2=Kousha |first2=Kayvan |title=ResearchGate: Disseminating, communicating, and measuring Scholarship? |journal=Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology |date=May 2015 |volume=66 |issue=5 |pages=876–889 |doi=10.1002/asi.23236 |citeseerx=10.1.1.589.5396 |s2cid=8974197 }}</ref> where it seems to attract an audience that it wider than just other scientists.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Thelwall |first1=Mike |last2=Kousha |first2=Kayvan |title=ResearchGate articles: Age, discipline, audience size, and impact |journal=Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology |date=February 2017 |volume=68 |issue=2 |pages=468–479 |doi=10.1002/asi.23675 |hdl=2436/609261 |s2cid=34087837 |hdl-access=free }}</ref> The usage of Research Gate and Academia in different academic communities has increasingly been studied in recent years.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Manca |first1=Stefania |title=ResearchGate and Academia.edu as networked socio-technical systems for scholarly communication: a literature review |journal=Research in Learning Technology |date=20 February 2018 |volume=26 |doi=10.25304/rlt.v26.2008 |doi-access=free }}</ref>

===Education===

The advent of social networking platforms may also be impacting the way(s) in which learners engage with technology in general. For a number of years, Prensky's (2001) dichotomy between [[Digital Natives]] and Digital Immigrants has been considered a relatively accurate representation of the ease with which people of a certain age range—in particular those born before and after 1980—use technology. Prensky's theory has been largely disproved, however, and not least on account of the burgeoning popularity of social networking sites and other metaphors such as White and Le Cornu's "Visitors" and "Residents" (2011) are greater currency. The use of online social networks by school libraries is also increasingly prevalent and they are being used to communicate with potential library users, as well as extending the services provided by individual school libraries. Social networks and their educational uses are of interest to many researchers. According to Livingstone and Brake (2010), "[[Social networking sites]], like much else on the Internet, represent a moving target for researchers and policymakers."<ref name=group>{{cite journal|last=Livingstone|first=Sonia|author2=Brake, David R|title=On the Rapid Rise of Social Networking Sites: New Findings and Policy Implications|journal=Children & Society|date=December 2010|volume=24|issue=1|pages=75–83|doi=10.1111/j.1099-0860.2009.00243.x|url=http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/30124/1/On_the_rapid_rise_of_social_networking_(LSERO_version).pdf|access-date=July 16, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120131063911/http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/30124/1/On_the_rapid_rise_of_social_networking_(LSERO_version).pdf|archive-date=January 31, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> Pew Research Center project, called Pew Internet, did a USA-wide survey in 2009 and in 2010 February published that 47% of American adults use a social networking website.<ref name=Lenhart>{{Cite book

}}</ref> Same survey found that 73% of online teenagers use SNS, which is an increase from 65% in 2008, 55% in 2006.<ref name=Lenhart /> Recent studies have shown that social network services provide opportunities within professional education, curriculum education, and learning. However, there are constraints in this area. Researches, especially in Africa, have disclosed that the use of social networks among students has been known to affect their academic life negatively. This is buttressed by the fact that their use constitutes distractions, as well as that the students tend to invest a good deal of time in the use of such technologies.

Albayrak and Yildirim (2015) examined the educational use of social networking sites. They investigated students' involvement in Facebook as a Course Management System (CMS) and the findings of their study support that Facebook as a CMS has the potential to increase student involvement in discussions and out-of-class communication among instructors and students.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Albayrak | first1 = D. | last2 = Yildirim | first2 = Z | year = 2015 | title = Using Social Networking Sites for Teaching and Learning: Students' Involvement in and Acceptance of Facebook as a Course Management System | journal = Journal of Educational Computing Research | volume = 52 | issue = 2| pages = 155–179 | doi = 10.1177/0735633115571299 | hdl = 11693/23247 | s2cid = 59430125 }}</ref>

====Professional use====
Professional use of social networking services refers to the employment of a network site to connect with other professionals within a given field of interest. These type of social networking services are referred to as "Career-oriented social networking markets (CSNM)".<ref>[https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12525-017-0248-3 Getting a job via career-oriented social networking markets]</ref>
[[LinkedIn]] is one example and is a social networking website geared towards companies and industry professionals looking to make new business contacts or keep in touch with previous co-workers, affiliates, and clients. LinkedIn not only provides a professional social use but also encourages people to inject their personality into their profile–making it more personal than a resume.<ref>{{cite web |last=Arruda |first=William |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/williamarruda/2014/03/04/22-linkedin-secrets-linkedin-wont-tell-you/ |title=22 LinkedIn Secrets LinkedIn Won't Tell You |work=Forbes |date=March 4, 2014 |access-date=October 17, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924184832/http://www.forbes.com/sites/williamarruda/2014/03/04/22-linkedin-secrets-linkedin-wont-tell-you/ |archive-date=September 24, 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Much of the early research on online communities assume that individuals using these systems would be connecting with others outside their preexisting social group or location, liberating them to form communities around shared interests, as opposed to shared geography.<ref name=Ellison>{{cite journal|last=Ellison|first=Nicole B.|author2=Steinfield, Charles|author3=Lampe, Cliff|title=The Benefits of Facebook "Friends:" Social Capital and College Student's Use of Online Social Network Sites|journal=Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication|year=2007|volume=12|issue=4|pages=1143–1168|doi=10.1111/j.1083-6101.2007.00367.x|url=http://www.elkhealth.pbworks.com/f/Ellison,+Steinfield,+and+Lampe+(2007).pdf|access-date=July 16, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120522154656/http://elkhealth.pbworks.com/f/Ellison,+Steinfield,+and+Lampe+(2007).pdf|archive-date=May 22, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> Other researchers have suggested that the professional use of network sites produce "[[social capital]]".

====Curriculum use====
According to Doering, Beach, and O'Brien, a future English curriculum needs to recognize a significant shift in how adolescents are communicating with each other.<ref name=Doering>{{cite journal|last=Doering|first=Aaron |author2=Beach, Richard |author3=O'Brien, David|title=Infusing Multimodal Tools and Digital Literacies into an English Education Program|journal=National Council of Teachers of English|date=October 2007|volume=40|issue=1|pages=41–60}}</ref> Curriculum uses of social networking services can also include sharing curriculum-related resources. Educators tap into user-generated content to find and discuss curriculum-related content for students. Responding to the popularity of social networking services among many students, teachers are increasingly using social networks to supplement teaching and learning in traditional classroom environments. This way they can provide new opportunities for enriching existing curriculum through creative, authentic and flexible, non-linear learning experiences.<ref name=Buzzetto-More>{{cite journal|last=Buzzetto-More|first=Nicole A.|title=Social Networking in Undergraduate Education|journal=Interdisciplinary Journal of Information, Knowledge, and Management|year=2010|volume=7|pages=63–90|doi=10.28945/1578|doi-access=free}}</ref> Some social networks, such as [[English, baby!]] and [[LiveMocha]], are explicitly education-focused and couple instructional content with an educational peer environment.<ref>{{cite web|title=2012 Learn English Comparisons|url=http://learn-english-review.toptenreviews.com/|publisher=Top Ten Reviews|access-date=September 3, 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120901044955/http://learn-english-review.toptenreviews.com/|archive-date=September 1, 2012}}</ref> The new [[Web 2.0]] technologies built into most social networking services promote conferencing, interaction, creation, research on a global scale, enabling educators to share, remix, and repurpose curriculum resources. In short, social networking services can become research networks as well as [[learning network]]s.<ref name=Mason>{{cite book|last=Mason, Robin|first=and Rennie, Frank|title=E-Learning and Social Networking Handbook Resources for Higher Education|year=2008|publisher=Rutledge|location=Hoboken|isbn=9780203927762|pages=1–24}}</ref>

====Learning use====
Educators and advocates of new [[digital literacy|digital literacies]] are confident that social networking encourages the development of transferable, technical, and social skills of value in formal and informal learning.<ref name=group /> In a formal learning environment, goals or objectives are determined by an outside department or agency. [[Tweeting]], [[instant messaging]], or [[blogging]] enhances student involvement. Students who would not normally participate in class are more apt to partake through social network services. Networking allows participants the opportunity for just-in-time learning and higher levels of engagement.<ref name=luo>{{cite journal |last1=Luo |first1=Tian |last2=Gao |first2=Fei |title=Enhancing Classroom Learning Experience by Providing Structures to Microblogging-Based Activities |journal=Journal of Information Technology Education: Innovations in Practice |date=1 January 2012 |volume=11 |pages=199–211 |url=https://digitalcommons.odu.edu/stemps_fac_pubs/2/ |doi=10.28945/1689 |access-date=November 17, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191117235343/https://digitalcommons.odu.edu/stemps_fac_pubs/2/ |archive-date=November 17, 2019 |url-status=live |doi-access=free }}</ref> The use of SNSs allow educators to enhance the prescribed curriculum.

Informal learning consists of the learner setting the goals and objectives. It has been claimed that media no longer just influence human culture; they are human culture.<ref name=Graber>{{cite journal |last1=Graber |first1=Diana |last2=Mendoza |first2=Kelly |title=New Media Literacy Education (NMLE): A Developmental Approach |journal=Journal of Media Literacy Education |date=10 September 2013 |volume=4 |issue=1 |url=https://digitalcommons.uri.edu/jmle/vol4/iss1/8/ |access-date=November 17, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191117235343/https://digitalcommons.uri.edu/jmle/vol4/iss1/8/ |archive-date=November 17, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> With such a high number of users between the ages of 13–18, a number of skills are developed. Participants hone technical skills in choosing to navigate through social networking services. This includes elementary items such as sending an instant message or updating a status. The development of new media skills are paramount in helping youth navigate the digital world with confidence.

Social networking services foster learning through what [[Henry Jenkins|Jenkins]] (2006) describes as a "[[participatory culture]]".<ref name=Jenkins>{{cite book |last=Jenkins |first=Henry |title=Confronting the challenges of participatory culture: Media education for the 21st century |year=2006 |publisher=The John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation |location=Chicago |isbn=9780262513623 |url=https://archive.org/details/9780262513623 }}{{page needed|date=November 2019}}</ref> A participatory culture consists of a space that allows engagement, sharing, mentoring, and an opportunity for social interaction. Participants of social network services avail of this opportunity. Informal learning, in the forms of participatory and social learning online, is an excellent tool for teachers to sneak in material and ideas that students will identify with and therefore, in a secondary manner, students will learn skills that would normally be taught in a formal setting in the more interesting and engaging environment of social learning.<ref name="Taylor, Gina, Rozi, Kristina">{{cite report |last1=Taylor |first1=Gina |last2=Rozi |first2=Kristina |year=2010 |title=Current Issues and Trends: Social Networking |citeseerx=10.1.1.395.234 }}{{unreliable source?|date=November 2019}}</ref> Sites like Twitter provide students with the opportunity to converse and collaborate with others in real time.

Social networking services provide a virtual "space" for learners. [[James Paul Gee|James Gee]] (2004) suggests that [[affinity spaces]] instantiate participation, collaboration, distribution, dispersion of expertise, and relatedness.<ref name=Gee>{{cite book |last=Gee |first=James Paul |title=Situated Language and Learning: A Critique of Traditional Schooling |year=2004 |publisher=Routledge |location=London }}{{page needed|date=November 2019}}</ref> Registered users share and search for knowledge which contributes to informal learning.

====Constraints====
In the past, social networking services were viewed as a distraction and offered no educational benefit. Blocking these social networks was a form of protection for students against wasting time, bullying, and invasions of privacy. In an educational setting, Facebook, for example, is seen by many instructors and educators as a frivolous, time-wasting distraction from schoolwork, and it is not uncommon to be banned in junior high or high school computer labs.<ref name=Gardner /> [[Cyberbullying]] has become an issue of concern with social networking services. According to the UK Children Go Online survey of 9- to 19-year-olds, it was found that a third have received bullying comments online.<ref name="Livingstone and bober">{{cite journal |last1=Livingstone |first1=Sonia |last2=Bober |first2=Magdalena |title=UK children go online: surveying the experiences of young people and their parents |date=July 2004 |url=http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/id/eprint/395 }}</ref> To avoid this problem, many school districts/boards have blocked access to social networking services such as Facebook, MySpace, and Twitter within the school environment. Social networking services often include a lot of personal information posted publicly, and many believe that sharing personal information is a window into privacy theft. Schools have taken action to protect students from this. It is believed that this outpouring of identifiable information and the easy communication vehicle that social networking services open the door to sexual predators, cyberbullying, and [[cyberstalking]].<ref name=Munoz>{{cite journal |last1=Muñoz |first1=Caroline Lego |last2=Towner |first2=Terri |title=Back to the 'wall': How to use Facebook in the college classroom |journal=First Monday |date=1 December 2011 |volume=16 |issue=12 |doi=10.5210/fm.v16i12.3513 }}</ref> In contrast, however, 70% of social media using teens and 85% of adults believe that people are mostly kind to one another on social network sites.<ref name=Lenhart />

Recent research suggests that there has been a shift in blocking the use of social networking services. In many cases, the opposite is occurring as the potential of online networking services is being realized. It has been suggested that if schools block them [social networking services], they are preventing students from learning the skills they need.<ref name=Davis2>{{cite journal|last=Davis|first=Michelle R.|title=Social Networking Goes to School|journal=Education Week|date=June 16, 2010|volume=3|issue=3|pages=16–23}}</ref> Banning social networking [...] is not only inappropriate but also borderline irresponsible when it comes to providing the best educational experiences for students.<ref name=Waddington>{{cite journal |last1=Waddington |first1=Jayme |title=Social Networking: The Unharnessed Educational Tool |journal=Undergraduate Research Journal at UCCS |date=19 January 2011 |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=12–18 |url=https://urj.uccs.edu/index.php/urj/article/view/113 |access-date=November 17, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191117234046/https://urj.uccs.edu/index.php/urj/article/view/113 |archive-date=November 17, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> Schools and school districts have the option of educating safe media usage as well as incorporating [[digital media]] into the classroom experience, thus preparing students for the literacy they will encounter in the future.

===Positive correlates===
A cyberpsychology research study conducted by Australian researchers demonstrated that a number of positive psychological outcomes are related to Facebook use.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Grieve|title=Face-to-Face or Facebook? Can social connectedness be derived online?|journal=Computers in Human Behavior|date=2013|pages=604–6099|doi=10.1016/j.chb.2012.11.017|volume=29|issue=3|display-authors=etal}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Grieve |first=Rachel |url=https://theconversation.com/thumbs-up-facebook-might-actually-be-good-for-you-11889 |title=Thumbs up: Facebook might actually be good for you |work=The Conversation |date=February 5, 2013 |access-date=October 17, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150930173514/http://theconversation.com/thumbs-up-facebook-might-actually-be-good-for-you-11889 |archive-date=September 30, 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref> These researchers established that people can derive a sense of social connectedness and belongingness in the online environment. Importantly, this online social connectedness was associated with lower levels of depression and anxiety, and greater levels of subjective well-being. These findings suggest that the nature of online social networking determines the outcomes of online social network use.

===Grassroots organizing===
Social networks are being used by activists as a means of low-cost grassroots organizing. Extensive use of an array of social networking sites enabled organizers of 2009 [[National Equality March]] to mobilize an estimated 200,000 participants to march on Washington with a cost savings of up to 85% per participant over previous methods.<ref name="march">{{cite news

The August [[2011 England riots]] were similarly considered to have escalated and been fuelled by this type of grassroots organization.

===Employment===
A rise in social network use is being driven by college students using the services to network with professionals for internship and job opportunities. Many studies have been done on the effectiveness of networking online in a college setting, and one notable one is by Phipps Arabie and Yoram Wind published in ''Advances in Social Network Analysis.''<ref>Arabie, Phipps, and Yoram Wind.

Thousand Oaks, Calif.: Sage Publications, 1994, pp. 254–273. {{ISBN|0-8039-4302-4}}</ref> Many schools have implemented online alumni directories which serve as makeshift social networks that current and former students can turn to for career advice. However, these alumni directories tend to suffer from an oversupply of advice-seekers and an undersupply of advice providers. One new social networking service, Ask-a-peer, aims to solve this problem by enabling advice seekers to offer modest compensation to advisers for their time. LinkedIn is also another great resource. It helps alumni, students and unemployed individuals look for work. They are also able to connect with others professionally and network with companies.

In addition, employers have been found to use social network sites to screen job candidates.<ref>{{Cite journal|doi = 10.1177/1461444816687294|title = Facebook profile picture appearance affects recruiters' first hiring decisions|journal = New Media & Society|volume = 20|issue = 3|pages = 1220–1239|year = 2018|last1 = Baert|first1 = Stijn|url = https://biblio.ugent.be/publication/8507595|hdl = 1854/LU-8507595|s2cid = 4956047|access-date = August 9, 2019|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20191219020947/https://biblio.ugent.be/publication/8507595|archive-date = December 19, 2019|url-status = live}}</ref>

===Hosting service===
A [[social network hosting service]] is a web hosting service that specifically hosts the user creation of web-based social networking services, alongside related applications.

===Trade network===
A social trade network is a service that allows participants interested in specific trade sectors to share related contents and personal opinions.

===Business model===
Few social networks charge money for membership. In part, this may be because social networking is a relatively new service, and the value of using them has not been firmly established in customers' minds. Companies such as [[MySpace|Myspace]] and [[Facebook]] sell [[online advertising]] on their site. Their business model is based upon large membership count, and charging for membership would be counterproductive.<ref>Chambers, Clem.

===Social interaction===
People use social networking sites for meeting new friends, finding old friends, or locating people who have the same problems or interests they have, called niche networking. More and more relationships and friendships are being formed online and then carried to an offline setting. Psychologist and University of Hamburg professor Erich H. Witte says that relationships which start online are much more likely to succeed. In this regard, there are studies which predict tie strength among the friends<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Kaushal |first1=R. |title=Tie strength prediction in OSN |journal=2016 3rd International Conference on Computing for Sustainable Global Development (INDIACom) |date=2016 |pages=841–844 |url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7724383 |isbn=978-9-3805-4421-2 |access-date=February 18, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200218140306/https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7724383 |archive-date=February 18, 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref> on social networking websites.  One online dating site claims that 2% of all marriages begin at its site, the equivalent of 236 marriages a day. Other sites claim one in five relationships begin online.

Users do not necessarily share with others the content which is of most interest to them, but rather that which projects a good impression of themselves.<ref name="VentureBeat Byrne 2012"/> While everyone agrees that social networking has had a significant impact on social interaction, there remains a substantial disagreement as to whether the nature of this impact is completely positive. A number of scholars have done research on the negative effects of Internet communication as well. These researchers have contended that this form of communication is an impoverished version of conventional face-to-face social interactions, and therefore produce negative outcomes such as loneliness and depression for users who rely on social networking entirely. By engaging solely in online communication, interactions between communities, families, and other social groups are weakened.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bargh |first1=John A. |last2=McKenna |first2=Katelyn Y.

==Issues==

{{Main|Issues relating to social networking services}}

Social networking services have led to many [[Privacy concerns with social networking services|issues regarding privacy]], bullying, social anxiety and potential for misuse.

==Investigations==
{{main|Use of social network websites in investigations}}

Social networking services are increasingly being used in legal and [[criminal investigation]]s. Information posted on sites such as MySpace and Facebook has been used by police ([[forensic profiling]]), probation, and university officials to prosecute users of said sites. In some situations, content posted on MySpace has been used in court.<ref>[http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,,00.html "MySpace exposes sex predators"], use of its content in the courtroom: [[The Herald and Weekly Times Ltd|Herald and Weekly Times (Australia)]] website. Retrieved January 19, 2008.</ref>

Facebook is increasingly being used by school administrations and law enforcement agencies as a source of evidence against student users. This site being the number one online destination for college students, allows users to create profile pages with personal details. These pages can be viewed by other registered users from the same school, which often include resident assistants and campus police who have signed up for the service.<ref>[http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=670380 "Getting booked by Facebook"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080531120122/http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=670380 |date=May 31, 2008 }}, courtesy of campus police: [[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]] website.

Social networking is more recently being used by various government agencies. Social networking tools serve as a quick and easy way for the government to get the suggestion of the public and to keep the public updated on their activity, however this comes with a significant risk of abuse, for example, to cultivate a [[culture of fear]] such as that outlined in ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' or ''[[THX-1138]]''.

===Business applications===
The use of social networking services in an enterprise context presents the potential of having a major impact on the world of business and work {{Harv|Fraser|Dutta|2008}}. Social networks connect people at low cost; this can be beneficial for [[entrepreneur]]s and [[small business]]es looking to expand their contact bases. These networks often act as a customer relationship management tool for companies selling products and services. Companies can also use social networks for advertising in the form of banners and text ads. Since businesses operate globally, social networks can make it easier to keep in touch with contacts around the world. Applications for social networking sites have extended toward businesses and brands are creating their own, high functioning sites, a sector known as [[brand networking]]. It is the idea that a brand can build its consumer relationship by connecting their consumers to the brand image on a platform that provides them relative content, elements of participation, and a ranking or score system. Brand networking is a new way to capitalize on social trends as a marketing tool. The power of social networks is beginning to permeate into internal culture of businesses where they are finding uses for [[collaboration]], [[file sharing]] and [[knowledge transfer]]. The term "[[enterprise social software]]" is becoming increasingly popular for these types of applications.

===Dating applications===
{{See also|Online dating service}}
Many social networks provide an online environment for people to communicate and exchange personal information for dating purposes. Intentions can vary from looking for a one time date, short-term relationships, and long-term relationships.<ref>[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,396461,00.html ''MySpace, Facebook Add Opportunity for Love, Trouble to Online Dating''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110206103614/http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,396461,00.html |date=February 6, 2011 }}, [[Fox News Channel|FoxNews.com]] website.</ref> Most of these social networks, just like online dating services, require users to give out certain pieces of information. This usually includes a user's age, gender, location, interests, and perhaps a picture. Releasing very personal information is usually discouraged for safety reasons.<ref>[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5336688 ''MySpace Adds a Security Monitor''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180324040929/https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5336688 |date=March 24, 2018 }}, [[NPR.com]] website.</ref> This allows other users to search or be searched by some sort of criteria, but at the same time, people can maintain a degree of anonymity similar to most online dating services. Online dating sites are similar to social networks in the sense that users create profiles to meet and communicate with others, but their activities on such sites are for the sole purpose of finding a person of interest to date. Social networks do not necessarily have to be for dating; many users simply use it for keeping in touch with friends, and colleagues.<ref>[http://www.internetnews.com/ec-news/article.php/3659911 ''Online Dating: Can Social Networks Cut In?''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110102151634/http://www.internetnews.com/ec-news/article.php/3659911 |date=January 2, 2011 }}, [[internetnews.com]] website.</ref>

However, an important difference between social networks and online dating services is the fact that online dating sites usually require a fee, where social networks are free.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://localtechwire.com/business/local_tech_wire/opinion/story/2449164/ |title=Online Dating vs. Social Networking – Which Will Emerge as Premier Matchmaker? |publisher=localtechwire.com |date=2008-08-18 |access-date=February 24, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100106120359/http://localtechwire.com/business/local_tech_wire/opinion/story/2449164/ |archive-date=January 6, 2010 |url-status=live }}</ref>
This difference is one of the reasons the online dating industry is seeing a massive decrease in revenue due to many users opting to use social networking services instead. Many popular online dating services such as [[Match.com]], [[Yahoo Personals]], and [[eHarmony.com]] are seeing a decrease in users, where social networks like [[MySpace]] and Facebook are experiencing an increase in users. The number of Internet users in the United States that visit online dating sites has fallen from a peak of 21% in 2003 to 10% in 2006.<ref>[https://www.forbes.com/2007/12/20/online-dating-love-tech-personal-cx_wt_1221dating.html ''Seeking Love Around The Web ''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170909162555/https://www.forbes.com/2007/12/20/online-dating-love-tech-personal-cx_wt_1221dating.html |date=September 9, 2017 }}, ''[[Forbes]]'' website.</ref> Whether it is the cost of the services, the variety of users with different intentions, or any other reason, it is undeniable that social networking sites are quickly becoming the new way to find dates online.

===Educational applications===
The [[National School Boards Association]] reports that almost 60% of students who use social networking talk about education topics online, and more than 50% talk specifically about schoolwork. Yet the vast majority of school districts have stringent rules against nearly all forms of social networking during the school day—even though students and parents report few problem behaviors online. Social networks focused on supporting relationships between teachers and their students are now used for learning, educators professional development, and content sharing. [[HASTAC]] is a collaborative social network space for new modes of learning and research in higher education, K-12, and lifelong learning; [[Ning (website)|Ning]] supports teachers; [[TermWiki]], [[TeachStreet]] and other sites are being built to foster relationships that include educational blogs, portfolios, formal and ad hoc communities, as well as communication such as chats, discussion threads, and synchronous forums. These sites also have content sharing and rating features. Social networks are also emerging as online [[yearbook]]s, both public and private. One such service is [[MyYearbook]], which allows anyone from the general public to register and connect. A new trend emerging is <!--Predicate agrees in number with its subject.--> private label yearbooks accessible only by students, parents, and teachers of a particular school, similar to [[Facebook]]'s beginning within Harvard.{{citation needed|date=April 2011}}

===Finance applications===
The use of [[virtual economy|virtual currency]] systems inside social networks create new opportunities for global finance. [[Hub Culture]] operates a virtual currency [[Ven (currency)|Ven]] used for global transactions among members, product sales<ref>{{cite web |last=Jordan |first=Andy |url=https://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2009/09/09/the-currency-revolution/ |title=Wall street journal blog article about Ven |work=The Wall Street Journal |date=September 9, 2009 |access-date=August 7, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002122204/http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2009/09/09/the-currency-revolution/ |archive-date=October 2, 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref> and financial trades in commodities and carbon credits.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.finextra.com/news/fullstory.aspx?newsitemid=22475|title=Virtual currency used for commodity trade|publisher=finextra.com|access-date=August 7, 2013|date=2011-04-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130526230443/http://www.finextra.com/news/fullstory.aspx?newsitemid=22475|archive-date=May 26, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2018/12/03/virtual-currencies-as-commodities/ |title=Virtual Currencies as Commodities? |access-date=February 12, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190212190446/https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2018/12/03/virtual-currencies-as-commodities/ |archive-date=February 12, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> In May 2010, [[carbon pricing]] contracts were introduced to the weighted basket of currencies and commodities that determine the floating exchange value of Ven.

===Medical and health applications===
Social networks are beginning to be adopted by healthcare professionals as a means to manage institutional knowledge, disseminate peer to peer knowledge and to highlight individual physicians and institutions. The advantage of using a dedicated medical social networking site is that all the members are screened against the state licensing board list of practitioners.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.primarypsychiatry.com/aspx/articledetail.aspx?articleid=975 |title=Social Networking: Now Professionally Ready |publisher=primarypsychiatry.com |access-date=March 27, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715112823/http://www.primarypsychiatry.com/aspx/articledetail.aspx?articleid=975 |archive-date=July 15, 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref> A new trend is emerging with social networks created to help its members with various physical and mental ailments.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20090529191957/http://www.doseofdigital.com/healthcare-pharma-social-media-wiki/ Comprehensive listing of medical applications using social networking] via Dose of Digital</ref> For people suffering from life-altering diseases or chronic health conditions, companies such as [[HealthUnlocked]] and [[PatientsLikeMe]] offers their members the chance to connect with others dealing with similar issues and share experiences. For alcoholics and addicts, SoberCircle gives people in recovery the ability to communicate with one another and strengthen their recovery through the encouragement of others who can relate to their situation. [[DailyStrength]] is also a website that offers support groups for a wide array of topics and conditions, including the support topics offered by [[PatientsLikeMe]] and SoberCircle. Some social networks aim to encourage healthy lifestyles in their users. [[SparkPeople]] and [[HealthUnlocked]] offer community and social networking tools for peer support during weight loss. [[Fitocracy]] and [[QUENTIQ]] are focused on exercise, enabling users to share their own workouts and comment on those of other users. Other aspects of social network usage include the analysis of data coming from existing social networks (such as Twitter) to discover large crowd concentration events (based on tweets location statistical analysis) and disseminate the information to e.g. mobility-challenged individuals for e.g. avoiding the specific areas and optimizing their journey in an urban environment.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Kousiouris |first1=George |last2=Akbar |first2=Adnan |last3=Sancho |first3=Juan |last4=Ta-shma |first4=Paula |last5=Psychas |first5=Alexandros |last6=Kyriazis |first6=Dimosthenis |last7=Varvarigou |first7=Theodora |title=An integrated information lifecycle management framework for exploiting social network data to identify dynamic large crowd concentration events in smart cities applications |journal=Future Generation Computer Systems |date=January 2018 |volume=78 |pages=516–530 |doi=10.1016/j.future.2017.07.026 |url=http://epubs.surrey.ac.uk/841839/1/LCC_pre_final%20%281%29.pdf |access-date=August 9, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190428184426/http://epubs.surrey.ac.uk/841839/1/LCC_pre_final%20%281%29.pdf |archive-date=April 28, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Social and political applications===
Social networking sites have recently showed a value in social and political movements.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Auer |first1=Matthew R. |title=The Policy Sciences of Social Media |journal=Policy Studies Journal |date=November 2011 |volume=39 |issue=4 |pages=709–736 |doi=10.1111/j.1541-0072.2011.00428.x |ssrn=1974080 |s2cid=153590593 }}</ref> In the [[2011 Egyptian revolution|Egyptian revolution]], [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]] both played an allegedly pivotal role in keeping people connected to the revolt. [[2011 Egyptian revolution#Online activism and the role of social media|Egyptian activists]] have credited social networking sites with providing a platform for planning protest and sharing news from [[Tahrir Square]] in real time. By presenting a platform for thousands of people to instantaneously share videos of mainly events featuring brutality, social networking can be a vital tool in revolutions.<ref name="Sutter, John D. 'The faces of Egypt's 'Revolution 2.0' CNN.com, 21 February 2011">{{cite news|last=Sutter|first=John D.|title=The faces of Egypt's 'Revolution 2.0'|url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/TECH/innovation/02/21/egypt.internet.revolution/index.html|access-date=May 13, 2011|publisher=CNN|date=February 21, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110513070529/http://www.cnn.com/2011/TECH/innovation/02/21/egypt.internet.revolution/index.html|archive-date=May 13, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref> On the flip side, social networks enable government authorities to easily identify, and repress, protestors and dissidents.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} Another thing that social media helps with in political applications is getting the younger generations involved in politics and ongoing political issues.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bakker |first1=Tom P. |last2=de Vreese |first2=Claes H. |title=Good News for the Future?

Perhaps the most significant political application of social media is [[Barack Obama 2008 presidential campaign|Barack Obama's election campaign in 2008]]. It was the first of its kind, as it successfully incorporated social media into its campaign winning strategy, evolving the way of political campaigns forevermore in the ever-changing technological world we find ourselves in today. His campaign won by engaging everyday people and empowering volunteers, donors, and advocates, through social networks, text messaging, email messaging and online videos.<ref>{{cite report |first1=Jennifer |last1=Aaker |first2=Victoria |last2=Chang |year=2009 |title=Obama and the Power of Social Media and Technology |journal=Stanford Graduate School of Business |url=https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/faculty-research/case-studies/obama-power-social-media-technology |access-date=November 18, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191118022959/https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/faculty-research/case-studies/obama-power-social-media-technology |archive-date=November 18, 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref> Obama's social media campaign was vast, with his campaign boasting 5&nbsp;million 'friends' on over 15 social networking sites, with over 3&nbsp;million friends just on Facebook.<ref name=McNally>{{cite web|author=Mark McNally|year=2010|title=10 Social Media lessons - Barack Obama election campaign|url=http://www.slideshare.net/MarkjMcNally/tsb-social-media-kt-ns-feb-2010/2-The_numbers_Driving_Innovation|access-date=April 26, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160513161049/http://www.slideshare.net/MarkjMcNally/tsb-social-media-kt-ns-feb-2010/2-The_numbers_Driving_Innovation|archive-date=May 13, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> Another significant success of the campaign was online videos, with nearly 2,000 YouTube videos being put online, receiving over 80&nbsp;million views.<ref name=McNally/>

In 2007, when Obama first announced his candidacy, there was no such thing as an iPhone or Twitter. However, a year later, Obama was sending out voting reminders to thousands of people through Twitter, showing just how fast social media moves. Obama's campaign was current and needed to be successful in incorporating social media, as social media acts best and is most effective in real time.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}

Building up to the 2012 presidential election, it was interesting to see how strong the influence of social media would be following the 2008 campaigns, where Obama's winning campaign had been social media-heavy, whereas McCain's campaign did not really grasp social media. JFK was the first president who really understood television, and similarly, Obama is the first president to fully understand the power of social media.<ref name=Rutledge>{{cite web |title=How Obama Won the Social Media Battle in the 2012 Presidential Campaign |url=http://mprcenter.org/blog/2013/01/how-obama-won-the-social-media-battle-in-the-2012-presidential-campaign/ |website=Media Psychology Research Center |access-date=April 27, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160427001708/http://mprcenter.org/blog/2013/01/how-obama-won-the-social-media-battle-in-the-2012-presidential-campaign/ |archive-date=April 27, 2016 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Obama has recognized social media is about creating relationships and connections and therefore used social media to the advantage of presidential election campaigns, in which Obama has dominated his opponents in terms of social media space.

Other political campaigns have followed on from Obama's successful social media campaigns, recognizing the power of social media and incorporating it as a key factor embedded within their political campaigns, for example, Donald Trump's presidential electoral campaign, 2016. Dan Pfeiffer, Obama's former digital and social media guru, commented that Donald Trump is "way better at the internet than anyone else in the GOP which is partly why he is winning".<ref>{{cite news |first1=Hannah Jane |last1=Parkinson |year=2015 |title=Can Donald Trump's social media genius take him all the way to the White House? |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/dec/23/donald-trump-social-media-strategy-internet-republican-nomination-president |access-date=April 25, 2016 |newspaper=The Guardian |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160424233834/https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/dec/23/donald-trump-social-media-strategy-internet-republican-nomination-president |archive-date=April 24, 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Research has shown that 66% of social media users actively engage in political activity online, and like many other behaviors, online activities translate into offline ones.<ref name=Rutledge/> With research from the 'MacArthur Research Network on Youth and Participatory Politics' stating that young people who are politically active online are double as likely to vote than those who are not politically active online.<ref name=Rutledge/> Therefore, political applications of social networking sites are crucial, particularly to engage with the youth, who perhaps are the least educated in politics and the most in social networking sites. Social media is, therefore, a very effective way in which politicians can connect with a younger audience through their political campaigns.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}

On June 28, 2020, [[The New York Times]] released an article sharing the finding of two researchers who studied the impact of [[TikTok]], a video-sharing and social networking application, on political expression. The application, besides being a creative space to express oneself, has been used maliciously to spread disinformation ahead of US President [[Donald Trump]]’s Tulsa rally in Okla. and amplified footages of police brutality at [[Black Lives Matter]] protests.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/28/style/tiktok-teen-politics-gen-z.html|title=TikTok Is Shaping Politics. But How?|access-date=28 June 2020|work=The New York Times}}</ref>

===Crowdsourcing applications===
{{Main|Crowdsourcing creative work}}
Crowdsourcing social media platform, such as [[Design Contest]], [[Arcbazar]], [[Tongal]], combined group of professional [[freelancer]]s, such as [[designer]]s, and help them communicate with business owners interested in their suggestion. This process is often used to subdivide tedious work or to fund-raise startup companies and charities, and can also occur offline.<ref name = wired2006>{{cite news | url = https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/14.06/crowds.html | title = The Rise of Crowdsourcing | work = [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] | first = Jeff | last = Howe | year = 2006 | access-date = March 11, 2017 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070414142954/http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/14.06/crowds.html | archive-date = April 14, 2007 | url-status = live }}</ref>

==Open source software==
