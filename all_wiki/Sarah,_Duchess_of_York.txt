After securing the Queen's permission (which, at that time, was required by the [[Royal Marriages Act 1772]], for all descendants of [[George III of Great Britain|King George III]]), Andrew and Sarah were married in [[Westminster Abbey]] on 23 July 1986. The Queen bestowed the title [[Duke of York]] upon Prince Andrew, and, as his new wife, Sarah automatically assumed her husband's royal and ducal status and became ''Her Royal Highness The Duchess of York''. As [[Duchess of York]], Sarah joined her husband in carrying out royal engagements, including official overseas visits.

She stayed for ten days in [[Northern Moor]], a suburb area in [[Wythenshawe]], Manchester, England, and the result was ''The Duchess on the Estate'', transmitted on ITV1 on 18 August 2009. A previous, similar television venture, ''The Duchess in Hull'', in which Sarah advised lower-income families on diet and behaviour, received similar criticism.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/tvandradioblog/2008/may/20/lastnightstvtheduchessin | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Nancy | last=Banks-Smith | title=Last night's TV: The Duchess in Hull | date=20 May 2008}}</ref>

In November 2016, it was reported that Sarah intended to sue [[News Group Newspapers]] (parent company of the ''News of the World'') and its owner [[Rupert Murdoch]] for £25 million in damages citing her "loss in earnings" as well as the subsequent "distress" that the media sting brought to her as the main reasons.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/nov/20/duchess-of-york-damages-mazher-mahmood-sting|title=Duchess of York seeks £25m damages over Mazher Mahmood sting|newspaper=The Guardian|first=Caroline|last=Davies|date=20 November 2016|access-date=23 January 2018}}</ref> In January 2018, it was reported that the actual amount the Duchess was seeking was £45 million.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jan/21/sarah-ferguson-claims-45m-in-damages-from-murdochs-news-group|title=Sarah Ferguson claims £45m in damages from Murdoch's News Group|newspaper=The Guardian|first=Kevin|last=Rawlinson|date=21 January 2018|access-date=23 January 2018}}</ref>

===Further debt problems===

It was reported in August 2010 that the Duchess might declare voluntary bankruptcy with debts of £5&nbsp;million,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/theroyalfamily/7932195/The-Duchess-of-York-faces-bankruptcy-over-her-5m-debts.html|title=The Duchess of York faces bankruptcy over her £5m debts|work=The Sunday Telegraph|location=UK |date=7 August 2010|access-date=8 August 2010|first=Andrew| last=Alderson}}</ref> though other sources had suggested she owed about £2&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/aug/08/sarah-ferguson-bankrupt-debts-millions|title=Sarah Ferguson faces bankruptcy after running up debts of millions|work=The Guardian|location=UK |date=8 August 2010|access-date=24 May 2010|first=Jenny| last=Percival}}</ref>

In March 2011, it was reported that [[Jeffrey Epstein]] had helped the Duchess avoid bankruptcy by paying off some of her debts. The payments were reportedly made after intervention from the Duke of York.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/theroyalfamily/8365020/Duke-of-York-appealed-to-Jeffrey-Epstein-to-help-Duchess-pay-debt.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Gordon | last=Rayner | title=Duke of York 'appealed to Jeffrey Epstein to help Duchess pay debt' | date=6 March 2011}}</ref> In the summer of 2011, ''[[Finding Sarah]]'' aired on the OWN network.

===Criminal charges and international arrest warrant===
On 13 January 2012, the Ministry of Justice of [[Turkey]] issued an international arrest warrant for the Duchess. She had travelled to Turkey in 2008, and covertly filmed a Turkish State Orphanage. The Turkish authorities alleged that the Duchess made a false declaration when entering the country (in relation to her motives for visiting Turkey), trespassed into a Turkish Government institution and also invaded the privacy of children.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.sky.com/story/fergie-charged-over-turkish-documentary-10482063|title=Fergie Charged Over Turkish Documentary|publisher=Sky News|date=12 January 2012|access-date=8 January 2017}}</ref> These charges carry sentences of up to 22 years imprisonment. Turkey and Britain have an extradition treaty; however, Home Office officials have stated,<blockquote>Under UK extradition law a judge must order the discharge of [an extradition request] if it is not an offence under UK law and in the country requesting extradition. In this case there is no offence in UK law so there will be no extradition.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/theroyalfamily/9013830/Duchess-of-York-evades-extradition-over-TV-row.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Gordon | last=Rayner | title=Duchess of York evades extradition over TV row | date=13 January 2012}}</ref></blockquote>

Turkey maintains that the Duchess distorted information about the orphanage and used an isolated incident in a smear campaign against the Republic of Turkey. Turkey invited international human rights organisations to inspect any orphanage of its choosing to show its transparency in relation to the issue.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://edition.cnn.com/2012/01/16/world/europe/turkey-us-duchess-film/ | work=CNN | title=Duchess of York cancels U.S. trip, raises questions - CNN.com | date=17 January 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/theroyalfamily/9016374/Turkish-government-presses-ahead-with-case-against-Duchess-of-York-despite-extradition-doubts.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Murray | last=Wardrop | title=Turkish government presses ahead with case against Duchess of York despite extradition doubts | date=16 January 2012}}</ref>

==Film==
In May 2004, Sarah hosted an eleven-minute production featurette on Universal's DVD ''[[Peter Pan (2003 film)|Peter Pan]]'', titled ''The Legacy of Pan''. Five months later, [[The Walt Disney Company|Walt Disney]] Feature Animation released a special DVD ''[[The Cat That Looked at a King]]'', with Sarah's voice in the role of the Queen; the story is derived from the ''[[Mary Poppins (book series)|Mary Poppins]]'' books by [[P. L. Travers]]. Sarah also made a cameo in the American television [[sitcom]] ''[[Friends]]'' in 1998.

Sarah had a producing role (credited as "Sarah Ferguson") in the 2009 [[Jean-Marc Vallée]] film ''[[The Young Victoria]]'', starring [[Emily Blunt]] and featured a background player role for Sarah's daughter Princess Beatrice.<ref name="bruniinterview">{{cite news| url= https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/13/movies/13ferguson.html |first=Frank|last=Bruni |author-link=Frank Bruni | work=[[The New York Times]] | title=Duchess of York as Film Producer | date=10 December 2009 | access-date=28 July 2011}}</ref><ref name="wpostreinvent">{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/12/18/AR2009121800070_2.html |first=Mary |last=Jordan |author-link=Mary Jordan (journalist)| work=[[The Washington Post]] | title=With her film 'The Young Victoria,' Sarah Ferguson reinvents herself yet again | date=20 December 2009 | access-date=20 July 2011}}</ref>

It was Sarah who conceived the idea for a film based upon the early years of [[Queen Victoria]]. She had been interested in the queen since her marriage to Prince Andrew, and had written two books about her with the help of a historian. The Victoria-Albert relationship in particular drew her into the queen's history, as she believed there were parallels between their marriage and her own with Prince Andrew, as they both "fought for their love" in the midst of public scrutiny.<ref name="bruniinterview"/>

In 2019, Sarah revealed that she was producing a documentary about [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]]'s mother [[Princess Louise of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg (1800–1831)|Princess Louise of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg]]. The documentary will focus on her life, particularly her separation from her husband [[Ernest I, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.msn.com/en-nz/health/lifestylefamily/sarah-ferguson-brings-to-light-one-of-the-royal-familys-saddest-tales/ar-AADkp8n?li=BBqdb1S|title=Sarah Ferguson brings to light one of the royal family's saddest tales|publisher=msn.com|date=24 June 2019|access-date=13 December 2019}}</ref>
