As of 2018, the [[Birmingham metropolitan area, Alabama|Birmingham-Hoover Metropolitan Statistical Area]] had a population of 1,151,801, making it the most populous in Alabama and [[List of metropolitan statistical areas|49th-most populous]] in the United States. Birmingham serves as an important regional hub and is associated with the [[Deep South]], [[Piedmont Atlantic Megaregion|Piedmont]], and [[Appalachia]]n regions of the nation.

Birmingham was founded in 1871, during the post–[[American Civil War|Civil War]] [[Reconstruction era]], through the merger of three farm towns, most notably [[Elyton]]. The new city was named for [[Birmingham]], [[England]], the United Kingdom's [[Second city of the United Kingdom|second largest city]] and then a major industrial city. The Alabama city annexed its smaller neighbors as it developed into a major industrial center based on mining, the [[steel|iron and steel industry]], and [[rail transport]]. Most of the original settlers were of [[English Americans|English ancestry]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Pickett |first=Albert James |title=History of Alabama, and Incidentally of Georgia and Mississippi, from the Earliest Period |origyear=1851 |year=2003 |publisher=River City Publishing |location=Montgomery, Ala. |isbn=978-1880216705 |url= http://homepages.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~cmamcrk4/pktfm.html |author2=Owen, Thomas McAdory |volume=1 |page=391 |accessdate=July 4, 2012 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120722014625/http://homepages.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~cmamcrk4/pktfm.html|archivedate=July 22, 2012}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=3H0FAAAAQAAJ Alt URL]</ref> The city was developed as a place where low paid, non-[[trade union|unionized]] immigrants (mainly Irish and Italian), along with African-Americans from rural Alabama, who worked in the city's steel mills and [[blast furnace]]s and gave it a competitive advantage over unionized industrial cities of the [[Midwest]] and [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]].<ref name=Connerly>{{cite book |last=Connerly |first=Charles E. |title="The Most Segregated City in America": City Planning and Civil Rights in Birmingham, 1920–1980 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IG3W_cD_UIgC |date=11 July 2013 |publisher=[[University of Virginia Press]] |isbn=978-0-8139-3538-6}}</ref>{{rp|14}}

[[File:Birmingham Alabama map 1903.jpg|thumb|[[Panoramic map]] of Birmingham's business section from 1903]]
From its founding through the end of the 1960s, Birmingham was a primary industrial center of the [[southern United States]]. Its rapid growth from 1881 through 1920 earned it the nicknames "The Magic City" and "The [[Pittsburgh]] of the South". Its major industries were iron and steel production. Major components of the railroad industry, including rails and railroad cars, were made in Birmingham. The two primary hubs of railroading in the "[[Deep South]]" have been Birmingham and [[Atlanta]]. The economy began to diversify in the latter half of the twentieth century, as the steel mills began to shut down. Banking, [[Telecommunication]]s, transportation, [[Electric power transmission|electrical power transmission]], medical care, college education, and [[insurance]] have become its major economic activities. Birmingham now ranks as one of the largest [[banking]] centers in the U.S. It is also one of the important business centers of the Southeast.

In [[higher education]], the Birmingham area has major colleges of medicine, dentistry, optometry, occupational therapy, physical therapy, pharmacy, law, engineering, and nursing. Birmingham has been the location of the [[University of Alabama School of Medicine]] (formerly the Medical College of Alabama) and the [[University of Alabama School of Dentistry]] since 1947. In 1969, it gained the [[University of Alabama at Birmingham]], one of three main campuses of the [[University of Alabama System]]. It is also home to three private colleges: [[Samford University]], [[Birmingham-Southern College]], and [[Miles College]]. The city has three of the state's five law schools: [[Cumberland School of Law]], [[Birmingham School of Law]], and [[Miles Law School]]. [[Jefferson State Community College|Jefferson State]] and [[Lawson State Community College]]s are also located in the city. Birmingham is also the headquarters of the [[Southwestern Athletic Conference]] and the [[Southeastern Conference]], one of the major U.S. collegiate athletic conferences.

===Founding and early growth===
[[File:Birmingham AL.png|thumb|left|L&N rail yard at Birmingham, ca. 1900]]

Birmingham was founded on June 1, 1871, by the Elyton Land Company, whose investors included cotton planters, bankers and railroad entrepreneurs. It sold lots near the planned crossing of the [[Alabama and Chattanooga Railroad|Alabama & Chattanooga]] and [[South & North Alabama Railroad|South & North Alabama]] railroads, including land that was part of the Benjamin P. Worthington plantation.  The city was chartered by the state legislature on December 19, 1871.<ref>{{cite web |date=January 8, 2008 |url=http://www.encyclopediaofalabama.org/article/h-1421 |title= Birmingham |author=Herbert J. "Jim" Lewis}}</ref>  The first business at that crossroads was a trading post and country store operated by Marre and Allen. The site of the railroad crossing was notable for its proximity to nearby deposits of iron ore, coal, and [[limestone]]&nbsp;– the three main raw materials used in making steel.

Birmingham is the only place where significant amounts of all three minerals can be found in close proximity.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.encyclopediaofalabama.org/face/Article.jsp?id=h-1597 |title= Birmingham Iron and Steel companies |last=Lewis |first=David |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Alabama |accessdate=August 19, 2011}}</ref> From the start the new city was planned as a center of industry. To emphasize this point, the city's founders named it in honor of Birmingham, England, one of the world's premier industrial cities. The growth of the planned city was impeded by an outbreak of [[cholera]] and a [[Panic of 1873|Wall Street crash]] in 1873. Soon afterward, however, it began to develop at an explosive rate.

The [[Tennessee Coal, Iron and Railroad Company|Tennessee Coal and Iron Company]] (TCI) became the leading steel producer in the South by 1892. In 1907 [[U.S. Steel]] purchased it and became the most important political and economic force in Birmingham. It resisted new industry, however, to keep wage rates down.<ref name=Connerly/>{{rp|119}}

In 1910, the towns of Elyton, Ensley and several others were absorbed into Birmingham pursuant to an act of the legislature.<ref>[https://www.al.com/opinion/2016/02/could_birmingham_annex_fairfie.html Bennett, Jim. "Could Birmingham annex Fairfield? It's complicated." ''AL.com'' 2-12-16; updated 1-13-19]</ref> From the early 20th century, the city grew so rapidly it earned the sobriquet "The Magic City". The downtown was redeveloped from a low-rise commercial and residential district into a busy grid of neoclassical mid- and high-rise buildings crisscrossed by [[streetcar]] lines. Between 1902 and 1912, four large office buildings were constructed at the intersection of 20th Street, the central north–south spine of the city, and 1st Avenue North, which connected the warehouses and industrial facilities along the east–west railroad corridor. This early group of skyscrapers was nicknamed the "[[Heaviest Corner on Earth]]".

Birmingham was hit by the [[1916 Irondale earthquake]] ({{M|l|link=y}} 5.1, intensity VII (''Very strong'')). A few buildings in the area were slightly damaged. The earthquake was felt as far as Atlanta and neighboring states.

While excluded from the best-paying industrial jobs, [[African Americans]] joined the migration of residents from rural areas to the city, drawn by economic opportunity.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

The [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]] of the 1930s struck Birmingham particularly hard, as the sources of capital fueling the city's growth rapidly dried up at the same time farm laborers, driven off the land, made their way to the city in search of work. Hundreds poured into the city, many riding in empty boxcars. "[[Hobo jungle]]s" were established in Boyles, the Twenty-fourth Street Viaduct, Green Springs Bridge, East Thomas, Pratt City, Carbon Hill and Jasper.<ref name="auto">{{cite book |last1=Flynt |first1=Wayne |title=Poor But Proud |date=February 5, 2016 |publisher=[[University of Alabama Press]]}}</ref> In 1934, [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|President Roosevelt]] called Birmingham the "worst-hit town in the country."<ref name="auto"/> [[New Deal]] programs put many city residents to work in [[Works Progress Administration|WPA]] and [[Civilian Conservation Corps|CCC]] programs, and they made important contributions to the city's infrastructure and artistic legacy, including such key improvements as [[Vulcan statue|Vulcan's tower]] and [[Oak Mountain State Park]].

The World War II demand for steel followed by a post-war building boom spurred Birmingham's rapid return to prosperity. Manufacturing diversified beyond the production of raw materials. Major civic institutions such as schools, parks, and museums, also expanded in scope.<ref name="Atkins-1981">{{cite book |title=The Valley and the Hills: An Illustrated History of Birmingham & Jefferson County |last=Atkins |first=Leah Rawls |year=1981 |publisher=Windsor Publications |isbn= 978-0-89781-031-9}}</ref>

Despite the city's growing population and wealth, Birmingham residents were markedly underrepresented in the state legislature. Although the state constitution required [[redistricting]] in accordance with changes in the decennial census, the state legislature did not act until the 1970s when the U.S. Supreme Court's landmark decision in ''[[Reynolds v. Sims]]'' forced it to do so. Birmingham-area voters had sued to force redistricting, and the Court in its ruling cited the principle of "[[one man, one vote]]". The Court found that the geographic basis of the state senate, which gave each county one senator, gave undue influence to rural counties. Representatives of rural counties also had disproportionate power in the state House of Representatives and had failed to provide support for infrastructure and other improvements in urban centers such as Birmingham, having little sympathy for urban populations. Prior to this time, the Alabama Legislature (known as the General Assembly until 1901) ran county governments as extensions of the state through their legislative delegations.

===Birmingham civil rights movement===
{{main|Birmingham campaign}}

In the 1950s and 1960s, Birmingham gained national and international attention as a center of activity during the [[Civil Rights Movement]]. Based on their members working in mining and industry, in the 1950s independent [[Ku Klux Klan]] (KKK) chapters had ready access to dynamite and other bomb materials. Whites unhappy with social changes in the 1950s committed racially motivated bombings of the houses of black families who moved into new neighborhoods or who were politically active, earning Birmingham the nickname "[[Bombingham]]".

Locally, the civil rights movement's activists were led by [[Fred Shuttlesworth]], a fiery preacher who became legendary for his fearlessness in the face of such violence.<ref>{{cite news |last= Cohen |first= Adam |title= Back to "Bombingham" |work=TIME |url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,986714,00.html |date=July 21, 1997 |accessdate=April 26, 2010}}</ref> But he found city officials resistant to making changes for integration or lessening of [[Jim Crow]].

[[File:16th Street Baptist Church.JPG|thumb|[[16th Street Baptist Church]], now a National Historic Landmark]]
A watershed in the civil rights movement occurred in 1963 when Shuttlesworth requested [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] and the [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]] (SCLC), which Shuttlesworth had co-founded, come to Birmingham to help end public [[racial segregation in the United States|segregation]].<ref name="test">[http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/2010/4/2010_4_90.shtml Clayborne Carson]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} "King Maker", ''American Heritage'', Winter 2010.</ref>

Together they launched "Project C" (for "Confrontation"), a massive non-violent demonstration against the Jim Crow system. While imprisoned in April 1963 for having taken part in a nonviolent protest, Dr. King wrote the now famous "[[Letter from Birmingham Jail]]", a defining treatise in his cause against segregation. During April and May, daily sit-ins and mass marches organized and led by movement leader [[James Bevel]] were met with police repression, tear gas, attack dogs, fire hoses, and arrests. More than 3,000 people were arrested during these protests, many of them children. King and Bevel filled the jails with students to keep the demonstrations going.

By September the SCLC and city were negotiating to end an economic [[boycott]] and desegregate stores and other facilities. On a Sunday in September 1963, a [[16th Street Baptist Church bombing|bomb went off at the 16th Street Baptist Church]], killing four black girls.<ref name="gado">{{cite web |url=http://www.crimelibrary.com/terrorists_spies/terrorists/birmingham_church/3.html |last=Gado |first=Mark |year=2007 |title=Bombingham |publisher=CrimeLibrary.com/Court TV Online |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070818222057/http://www.crimelibrary.com/terrorists_spies/terrorists/birmingham_church/3.html |archivedate=August 18, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> The activists' protests and national outrage about the police and KKK violence contributed to the ultimate desegregation of public accommodations in Birmingham and also passage of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]].<ref>{{cite news |work= Civil Rights Movement Veterans |title= The Birmingham Campaign |url= http://www.crmvet.org/tim/timhis63.htm#1963bham |date= |access-date=}}</ref>

In 1998, the Birmingham Pledge, written by local attorney James Rotch, was introduced at the Martin Luther King Unity Breakfast. As a grassroots community commitment to combating racism and prejudice, it has since been used for programs in all fifty states and in more than twenty countries.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.encyclopediaofalabama.org/face/Article.jsp?id=h-1884 |title=encyclopediaofalabama.org |publisher=encyclopediaofalabama.org |date=May 12, 2011 |accessdate=July 14, 2012}}</ref>

In 2020, after protests against the [[killing of George Floyd]], a Confederate memorial was removed from [[Linn Park, Birmingham, Alabama|Linn Park]], the city's central park.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Birmingham's 1905 Confederate monument coming down - al.com|url=https://www.al.com/galleries/25232IKMC5FVLJS2UMT5MPZCXM/|access-date=2020-06-03|website=al.com|language=en}}</ref>

===Recent history===
In the 1970s, [[urban renewal]] efforts focused around the development of the [[University of Alabama at Birmingham]], which has become a major medical and research center. In 1971 Birmingham celebrated its centennial with a round of public-works improvements, including the upgrading of [[Vulcan statue|Vulcan Park]] and the construction of a major downtown convention center containing a 2,500-seat symphony hall, theater, 19,000-seat arena, and exhibition halls. Birmingham's banking institutions enjoyed considerable growth as well, and new skyscrapers were constructed in the city center for the first time since the 1920s. These projects helped the city's economy to diversify, but did not prevent the exodus of many of the city's residents to independent suburbs. [[Suburbanization]] was a national trend. In 1979 Birmingham elected Dr. [[Richard Arrington Jr.]] as its first African-American mayor.

[[File:Birmingham Skyline.jpeg|thumb|Birmingham skyline at night from atop the City Federal Building, July 1, 2015]]
The population inside Birmingham's city limits has fallen over the past few decades, due in large part to "[[white flight]]" from the city to the surrounding suburbs and loss of jobs following industrial and railroad restructuring. The city's formerly most populous ethnic group, non-Hispanic white,<ref name="census"/> has declined from 57.4 percent in 1970 to 21.1 percent in 2010.<ref>{{cite web |title=Alabama&nbsp;– Race and Hispanic Origin for Selected Cities and Other Places: Earliest Census to 1990 |publisher=U.S. Census Bureau |url=https://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0076/twps0076.html |website=Census.gov |accessdate=April 21, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120812191959/http://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0076/twps0076.html |archivedate=August 12, 2012 }}</ref> From 340,887 in 1960, the city's population had decreased to 242,820 in 2000, a loss of about 29 percent. By 2010, Birmingham's population had reached 212,237, its lowest since the mid-1920s, but the city has since stopped losing residents.<ref>{{cite web |title=Birmingham sees no population growth, suburban cities still increasing, Census shows |publisher=U.S. Census Bureau |url=http://www.al.com/news/birmingham/index.ssf/2017/05/birmingham_stagnant_chelsea_se.html}}</ref> That same period saw a corresponding rise in the populations of the suburban communities of [[Hoover, Alabama|Hoover]], [[Vestavia Hills, Alabama|Vestavia Hills]], [[Alabaster, Alabama|Alabaster]], [[Trussville, Alabama|Trussville]], and [[Gardendale, Alabama|Gardendale]].

New resources have been dedicated in reconstructing the downtown area into a 24-hour [[mixed-use]] district.

==Geography==
Birmingham occupies Jones Valley, flanked by long parallel [[Ridge-and-Valley Appalachians|mountain ridges]] (tailing ends of the [[Appalachian Mountains]]) running from northeast to southwest. The valley is drained by small creeks (Village Creek, Valley Creek) which flow into the [[Black Warrior River]]. The valley was bisected by the principal railroad corridor, along which most of the early manufacturing operations began.

[[Red Mountain (Birmingham)|Red Mountain]] lies immediately south of downtown. Many of Birmingham's television and radio broadcast towers are lined up along this prominent ridge. The "Over the Mountain" area, including Shades Valley, [[Shades Mountain]] and beyond, was largely shielded from the industrial smoke and rough streets of the industrial city. This is the setting for Birmingham's more affluent suburbs of [[Mountain Brook, Alabama|Mountain Brook]], [[Vestavia Hills, Alabama|Vestavia Hills]], [[Homewood, Alabama|Homewood]], [[Pelham, Alabama|Pelham]], and [[Hoover, Alabama|Hoover]]. South of Shades Valley is the [[Cahaba River]] basin, one of the most diverse river ecosystems in the United States.

[[Sand Mountain (Alabama)|Sand Mountain]], a lower ridge, flanks the city to the north and divides Jones Valley from much more rugged land to the north. The [[Louisville and Nashville Railroad]] (now [[CSX Transportation]]) enters the valley through Boyles Gap, a prominent gap in the long low ridge.

Ruffner Mountain, due east of the heart of the city, is home to [[Ruffner Mountain Nature Preserve]], one of the largest urban nature reserves in the U.S.

Birmingham is {{convert|147|mi}} west of [[Atlanta]], {{convert|92|mi}} north of [[Montgomery, Alabama|Montgomery]], {{convert|147|mi}} northeast of [[Meridian, Mississippi]], {{convert|239|mi}} southeast of [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], {{convert|192|mi}} south of [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], and {{convert|148|mi}} southwest of [[Chattanooga, Tennessee|Chattanooga]],<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.maps.google.com| title=Google Maps| website=Maps.google.com| access-date=April 18, 2018| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080220201329/http://www.maps.google.com/| archive-date=February 20, 2008| url-status=dead| df=mdy-all}}</ref> all via Interstate highways.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the city has an area of {{convert|384.9|km2|order=flip}}, of which {{convert|378.3|km2|order=flip}} are land and {{convert|6.6|km2|order=flip}}, or 1.71%, are water.<ref name="census.gov"/>

===Suburbs===
Birmingham has numerous suburbs. As with many major areas, most of the metropolitan population lives outside the city boundaries. In 2007, the metropolitan area was made up of 7 counties, 102 cities, and 21 school districts.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.al.com/birminghamnews/documents/crossroads.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-06-09 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160115012808/http://www.al.com/birminghamnews/documents/crossroads.pdf |archivedate=January 15, 2016 }}</ref> Since then [[Alabaster, Alabama|Alabaster]] and [[Pelham, Alabama|Pelham]] have broken away from the [[Shelby County Schools (Alabama)|Shelby County School System]] to form their own school systems. Some analysts argue that the region suffers from having so many suburbs; companies play jurisdictions against each other to gain tax and other financial incentives for relocation, resulting in no net gain in the area's economy.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blog.al.com/comebacktown/2015/06/how_to_extort_money_from_city.html|title=How to extort money from City of Homewood: Reader opinion|website=Al.com|accessdate=July 21, 2015}}</ref>

===Climate===
Birmingham has a [[humid subtropical climate]], characterized by hot summers, mild winters, and abundant rainfall. January has a daily mean temperature of {{convert|43.8|°F|1}}, and there is an average of 47 days annually with a low at or below freezing, and 1.4 where the high does not surpass freezing.<ref name = "NOAA txt"/> July has a daily mean temperature of {{convert|81.1|°F|1}}; highs reach or exceed {{convert|90|°F|0}} on 55 days per year and {{convert|100|°F|0}} on 2 or 3.<ref name = "NOAA txt"/> Precipitation is relatively well-distributed throughout the year, with March the wettest month on average, and October the driest. Snow occasionally falls during winter, but many winters pass with no snow or only a trace. However, {{convert|10.3|in|cm|1}} fell on March 13, 1993, during the [[1993 Storm of the Century]], which established the highest daily snowfall, one-storm, and winter season total on record. Average snowfall over the winter season, based on the 1981–2010 period, is {{convert|1.6|in|cm|1|abbr=on}}, but, for the same period, median monthly snowfall for each month was zero.<ref name = "NOAA txt"/>

The spring and fall months are pleasant but variable as cold fronts frequently bring strong to severe thunderstorms and occasional tornadoes to the region. The fall season (primarily October) features less rainfall and fewer storms, as well as lower humidity than the spring, but November and early December represent a secondary severe weather season. Birmingham is in the heart of a [[Tornado Alley]] known as the [[Dixie Alley]] due to the high frequency of tornadoes in Central Alabama. The greater Birmingham area has been hit by two F5 tornadoes; one in Birmingham's northern suburbs in [[Birmingham Tornado of April 1977|1977]], and second in the western suburbs in [[Birmingham Tornado of April 1998|1998]]. The area was hit by [[2011 Tuscaloosa–Birmingham tornado|an EF4 tornado]] which was part of the [[2011 Super Outbreak]]. In late summer and fall months, Birmingham experiences occasional tropical storms and hurricanes due to its proximity to the Central Gulf Coast.

The record high temperature is {{convert|107|°F|0}}, set on July 29, 1930,<ref name="Jul Averages">{{cite web |url=http://www.weather.com/outlook/travel/vacationplanner/wxclimatology/daily/35209?climoMonth=7 |title=July Daily Averages for Birmingham, AL (35209) |publisher=Weather.com |accessdate=November 24, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121027154130/http://www.weather.com/outlook/travel/vacationplanner/wxclimatology/daily/35209?climoMonth=7 |archivedate=October 27, 2012 |df=mdy }}</ref> and the record low is {{convert|−10|°F|0}}, set on [[Great Blizzard of 1899|February 13, 1899]].<ref name="Feb Averages">{{cite web |url=http://www.weather.com/outlook/travel/vacationplanner/wxclimatology/daily/35209?climoMonth=2 |title=February Daily Averages for Birmingham, AL (35209) |publisher=weather.com |accessdate=April 21, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140628031821/http://www.weather.com/outlook/travel/vacationplanner/wxclimatology/daily/35209?climoMonth=2 |archivedate=June 28, 2014 |df=mdy }}</ref>

==Arts and culture==
[[File:Alabama Theatre.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Alabama Theatre]]]]

Birmingham has a distinctly [[Deep South]] culture and a dynamic [[Upper South]] influence that has molded its culture from its beginning. This is due to the city's location as the gateway opening to and from both regions and their influences.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} Historically, many African Americans from the [[Black Belt (region of Alabama)|Black Belt]] and Whites from across the state settled this area in large numbers in the 20th century pursuing jobs in the steel industry, contributing their music and foods to its Southern nature.<ref>{{cite web |title=Iron and Steel Production in Birmingham |url=http://www.encyclopediaofalabama.org/article/h-1638|website=Encyclopediaofalabama.org}}</ref> In the 1970s the city began to diversify spurred on by the growth of the [[University of Alabama at Birmingham]] which attracted many students from out of state as well as international students. During this period Birmingham solidified itself as the most diverse city in Alabama and the hub of a growing [[Multi-culturalism|multi-cultural]] metropolitan area. This blending of southern cultures with international flavors is most evident in the city's cosmopolitan [[Southside, Birmingham, Alabama|Southside]] neighborhood. As the city's hub for bohemian culture and a long frequented nightlife area it is among the most popular and fastest growing in the city. The presence of UAB helps make it the city's most racially and ethnically diverse neighborhood.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Birmingham has a strong-mayor variant [[mayor–council government|mayor–council]] form of government, led by a mayor and a nine-member city council. The current system replaced the previous [[city commission government]] in 1962 (primarily as a way to remove Commissioner of Public Safety [[Bull Connor|Eugene "Bull" Connor]] from power).<ref>Nunnelley, William A. (1991) ''Bull Connor''. Tuscaloosa: University of Alabama Press. {{ISBN|0-8173-0495-9}}</ref>
{{See also|List of Mayors of Birmingham, Alabama|List of Birmingham neighborhoods}}

By Alabama law, an issue before a city council must be approved by a two-thirds majority vote.<ref>Act No. 452, Ala. Acts 1955, as supplemented by Act No. 294, Ala. Acts 1965</ref> Executive powers are held entirely by the mayor's office. Birmingham's current mayor is [[Randall Woodfin]].

In 1974 Birmingham established a structured network of [[neighborhood association]]s and community advisory committees to insure public participation in governmental issues that affect neighborhoods. Neighborhood associations are routinely consulted on matters related to zoning changes, liquor licenses, economic development, policing and other city services. Neighborhoods are also granted discretionary funds from the city's budget to use for [[capital improvement plan|capital improvements]]. Each neighborhood's officers meet with their peers to form Community Advisory Committees, which are granted broader powers over city departments. The presidents of these committees, in turn, form the Citizens' Advisory Board, which meets regularly with the mayor, council, and department heads. Birmingham is divided into 23 communities, and again into 99 individual neighborhoods with individual neighborhood associations.<ref>Thomson, Ken (1988) "[http://www.cpn.org/topics/community/birmingham.html Birmingham Participation] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090505101342/http://www.cpn.org/topics/community/birmingham.html |date=May 5, 2009 }}".

===Political controversy===
Birmingham's recent political history has gained national attention. During his term as mayor, [[Larry Langford]] was arrested on charges of [[bribery]]. Langford was convicted in 2010 of accepting bribes in exchange for steering $7.1&nbsp;million in county revenue to a prominent investment banker. The bribes included $230,000 cash, clothes, and jewelry. Langford was sentenced to 15 years in prison and fined $360,000 by a federal judge. The banker, Bill Blount, and a lobbyist, Al la Pierre, pled guilty and were sentenced to brief prison sentences.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/06/us/06birmingham.html |title=Ex-Mayor Gets 15 Years for Bribery; City Pays Price |date=March 6, 2010 |website=The New York Times}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/CRIME/12/01/birmingham.mayor/ |title=FBI arrests Birmingham, Alabama, mayor - CNN.com |website=Cnn.com}}</ref>

The greater-Birmingham metropolitan area is the home of numerous independent school systems, because there has been a great deal of fragmentation of educational systems in Alabama and especially Jefferson County. Some of the school systems only have three to five schools. The metropolitan area's three largest school systems are the [[Jefferson County Schools (Alabama)|Jefferson County School System]], Birmingham City Schools, and the [[Shelby County Schools (Alabama)|Shelby County School System]]. However, there are many smaller school systems.

The Birmingham area is reputed to be the home of some of Alabama's best high schools, colleges and universities. In 2005, the [[Jefferson County International Baccalaureate School]] in [[Irondale, Alabama|Irondale]], an eastern suburb of Birmingham, was rated as the No. 1 high school in America by ''[[Newsweek]]''. The school remains among the nation's top high schools. [[Mountain Brook High School]] placed 250th on the list. Other area schools that have been rated among America's best in various publications include [[Homewood High School]], [[Vestavia Hills High School]], [[Hewitt-Trussville High School]], and the [[Alabama School of Fine Arts]] downtown. The metro area also has three highly regarded private college-preparatory schools: [[Saint Rose Academy]], in Birmingham proper; the [[Altamont School]], also in Birmingham proper; and [[Indian Springs School]] in north Shelby County near Pelham.

==Urban planning==
[[File:Railroad Park, Birmingham.jpg|thumb|View of Birmingham from Railroad Park]]
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2018}}

Before the first structure was built in Birmingham, the directors of the Elyton Land Company developed a plan for the city's {{convert|1160|acre|km2}}. The streets were numbered from west to east, leaving 20th Street to form the central spine of downtown, anchored on the north by Capital Park and stretching into the slopes of Red Mountain to the south. A "railroad reservation" was granted through the center of the city, running east to west and zoned solely for industrial uses. As the city grew, bridges and underpasses separated the streets from the railroad bed, lending this central reservation some of the impact of a river (without the pleasant associations of a waterfront). From the start, Birmingham's streets and avenues were unusually wide at {{convert|80|to|100|ft|m}}, purportedly to help evacuate unhealthy smoke.

In the early 20th century professional planners helped lay out many of the new industrial settlements and [[company town]]s in the Birmingham District, including Corey (now [[Fairfield, Alabama|Fairfield]]), which was developed for the Tennessee Coal, Iron and Railroad Company (subsequently purchased by [[U.S. Steel]]). At the same time, a movement to consolidate several neighboring cities gained momentum. Although local referendums indicated mixed feelings about annexation, the Alabama legislature enacted an expansion of Birmingham's corporate limits that became effective on January 1, 1910.

The Robert Jemison Company developed many residential neighborhoods to the south and west of Birmingham which are still renowned for their aesthetic quality.

A 1924 plan for a system of parks, commissioned from the [[Olmsted Brothers]], is seeing renewed interest with several significant new parks and greenways under development. Birmingham officials have approved a City Center Master Plan developed by [[Urban Design Associates]] of Pittsburgh, which advocates strongly for more residential development in the downtown area. The plan also called for a major park over several blocks of the central railroad reservation: [[Railroad Park]], which opened in 2010. Along with Ruffner Mountain Park and Red Mountain Park, Birmingham ranks first in the United States for public green space per resident.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

* {{Jct|state=AL|I|422}} (proposed Northern Bypass)
* {{Jct|state=AL|I|459}} (Southern Bypass)
The city is served by four Interstate Highways: [[Interstate 20 in Alabama|Interstate 20]], [[Interstate 65 in Alabama|Interstate 65]], [[Interstate 59]], and [[Interstate 22]], as well as a southern bypass expressway [[Interstate 459]], which connects with I-20/59 to the southwest, with I-65 to the south, I-20 to the east, and I-59 to the northeast. Beginning in downtown Birmingham is the Elton B. Stephens Expressway—the "Red Mountain Expressway" to the southeast—which carries [[U.S. Route 31|U.S. Highway 31]] and [[U.S. Highway 280]] to, through, and over Red Mountain. Interstate 22 connects I-65 and [[Memphis, Tennessee]]. Construction has begun on the first segment of I-422, a Northern Beltline Highway that will serve the suburbs on the opposite side of Birmingham from I-459.

====Public transport====

In the area of metropolitan public transportation, Birmingham is served by the [[Birmingham-Jefferson County Transit Authority]] (BJCTA) bus, [[Tourist trolley|trolley]], and [[paratransit]] system, which from 1985 until 2008 was branded the Metro Area Express (MAX). BJCTA also operates a "downtown circulator" service named "D A R T" for Downtown Area Runabout Transit, which consists of two routes in the central business district and one in the UAB area, and also operates hourly Airport Shuttle routes directly from downtown and UAB area hotels to the airport.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bjcta.org |title=Birmingham-Jefferson County Transit Authority |publisher=Bjcta.org |accessdate=July 14, 2012}}</ref> Bus service to other cities is provided by [[Greyhound Lines]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://locations.greyhound.com/bus-stations/us/alabama/birmingham/bus-station-420156 |title=Birmingham Alabama Bus Station |website=Greyhound.com |accessdate=July 21, 2015}}</ref> [[Megabus (North America)|Megabus]] offers bus service to Atlanta and Memphis.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://us.megabus.com/routemap.aspx |title=Megabus Route Map |website=Us.megabus.com |accessdate=2017-01-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150423071232/http://us.megabus.com/routemap.aspx |archive-date=April 23, 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

[[Birmingham–Shuttlesworth International Airport]], {{convert|4|mi|0}} northeast of downtown, serves more than 3&nbsp;million passengers every year. With more than 160 flights daily, the airport offers flights to 37 cities provided by [[United Express]], [[Delta Air Lines]]/Delta Connection, [[American Eagle (airline brand)|American Eagle]], [[Southwest Airlines]], and [[Frontier Airlines]].

Birmingham is served by three major railroad freight lines: the [[Norfolk Southern]] Company, [[CSX Transportation]], and the [[BNSF Railway]], together with smaller regional railroads, the [[Alabama Warrior Railway]] and the [[Birmingham Southern Railroad]]. [[Amtrak]] operates one passenger train, the ''[[Crescent (train)|Crescent]]'', each direction the [[Birmingham station (Alabama)|Birmingham station]] on a tri-weekly basis.

===Utilities===
The water for Birmingham and the intermediate urbanized area is served by the Birmingham Water Works Board (BWWB). A public authority that was established in 1951, the BWWB serves all of Jefferson, northern Shelby, and western St. Clair counties. The largest reservoir for BWWB is Lake Purdy, which is on the Jefferson and Shelby County line, but has several other reservoirs including Bayview Lake in western Jefferson County. There are plans to pipeline water from Inland Lake in Blount County and Lake Logan Martin, but those plans are on hold indefinitely.

Jefferson County Environmental Services serves the Birmingham metro area with sanitary sewer service. Sewer rates have increased in recent years<ref name="BBC Scandal">{{cite web |title=The scandal of the Alabama poor cut off from water |author=Brian Wheeler |work=BBC News |date=December 14, 2011 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-16037798 |accessdate=December 15, 2011}}</ref> after citizens concerned with pollution in area waterways filed a lawsuit that resulted in a federal consent decree to repair an aging sewer system. Because the estimated cost of the consent decree was approximately three times more than the original estimate, many blame the increased rates on corruption of several Jefferson County officials.<ref name="BBC Scandal"/> The [[Jefferson County sewer controversy|sewer construction and bond-swap agreements]] continue to be a controversial topic in the area.<ref name="BBC Scandal"/>

Electric power is provided primarily by [[Alabama Power]], a subsidiary of the [[Southern Company]]. However, some of the surrounding area such as [[Bessemer, Alabama|Bessemer]] and [[Cullman, Alabama|Cullman]] are provided power by the [[Tennessee Valley Authority|TVA]]. Bessemer also operates its own water and sewer system.<ref>[http://www.bessemeral.org/Water_Services.htm]{{dead link|date=July 2012}}</ref> Natural gas is provided by [[Alagasco|Spire Alabama Inc.]], although some metro area cities operate their own natural gas services. The local telecommunications are provided by AT&T. Cable television service is provided by [[Bright House Networks]] within the cities of Birmingham and Irondale, and [[Charter Communications]] in the rest of the metro area.
