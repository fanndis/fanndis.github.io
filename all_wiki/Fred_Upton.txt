In November 2013, Upton introduced the Keep Your Health Plan Act, which would let health-care insurers continue to sell plans that did not meet the Affordable Care Act's “essential health benefits” standard. It passed the House with support from 39 Democrats plus all but four Republicans, but did not become law. In an article for USA Today, Upton explained that he had heard from “countless constituents in Michigan” who, despite President Obama's promise that “If you like your health care plan, you'll be able to keep your health care plan,” were “losing their coverage,” as were “millions of Americans who took the president at his word and are now receiving insurance termination notices and alternatives that are often much more expensive.”<ref>Rep.

In March 2017, Upton said: “Obamacare has not delivered on countless promises.” It was reported in April 2017 that Upton had “serious concerns” with President Donald Trump's proposed health-care law because it would mean “potential higher costs to those with pre-existing illnesses.” In May 2017, after the addition of a new amendment written by Upton that provided additional funds for those with pre-existing conditions, he said he would vote for the bill and said he believed it could now pass the House. In July, Upton was among a group of members from both parties who “unveiled a set of solutions” intended to improve health-care coverage.<ref>Gerstein, Michael; Upton concerned with GOP Obamacare replacement; Detroit News; April 29, 2017; https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/politics/2017/04/29/upton-gop-obamacare-replacement/101070168/ {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180710011105/https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/politics/2017/04/29/upton-gop-obamacare-replacement/101070168/ |date=2018-07-10 }}</ref><ref>Bryan, Bob; Republicans just moved closer than ever to passing their Obamacare overhaul; Business Insider; May 23, 2017; http://www.businessinsider.com/ahca-obamacare-repeal-vote-count-upton-2017-5 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180710010640/http://www.businessinsider.com/ahca-obamacare-repeal-vote-count-upton-2017-5 |date=2018-07-10 }}</ref>
