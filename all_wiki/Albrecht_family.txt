The '''Albrecht family''' is a North German family whose members have been prominent as civil servants, politicians and businesspeople.

The family is descended from Barthold Albrecht (born 1557), who was a pastor in [[Bodenwerder]]. Numerous of his descendants were doctors, jurists and civil servants in what became the [[Electorate of Hanover|Electorate]] and [[Kingdom of Hanover]], a state that was in a personal union with the [[United Kingdom]] from 1714. The family was among the ''[[Hübsche families|hübsche]]'' ("courtly" or "genteel") families of Hanover, the informal third elite group after the nobility and the clergy that encompassed the higher bourgeoisie and university-educated civil servants.

The lawyer [[Karl Franz Georg Albrecht]] (1799–1873) became director-general of direct taxation in the [[Kingdom of Hanover]] in 1847, and then director-general of customs from 1854 and member of the [[State Council of Hanover]] from 1856. He was the father of [[George Alexander Albrecht (businessman)|George Alexander Albrecht]] (1834–1898), who became a wealthy cotton merchant in the city state of [[Bremen]], where he became part of the [[Hanseaten (class)|Hanseatic]] elite and was appointed as the Austro-Hungarian [[Consul (representative)|Consul]] in 1895. He married Louise Dorothea Betty Knoop (1844–1889), the daughter of the major cotton industrialist, Baron [[Ludwig Knoop]], who had been ennobled in the Russian Empire. They were the parents of the cotton merchant [[Carl Albrecht (businessman)|Carl Albrecht]] (1875–1952), who married Mary [[Ladson family|Ladson]] Robertson (1883–1960), who belonged to a prominent American family of the [[Southern aristocracy]] from [[Charleston, South Carolina]]; she was a descendant of [[James Ladson]] and several colonial governors of Carolina. Carl and Mary Albrecht were the parents of the medical doctor and psychologist [[Carl Albrecht (psychologist)|Carl Albrecht]] (1902–1965). The latter was the father of the conductor [[George Alexander Albrecht]] and the European civil servant and later Prime Minister of Lower Saxony [[Ernst Albrecht (politician, born 1930)|Ernst Albrecht]]. The conductor George Alexander Albrecht was the father of the chief conductor of the Dutch National Opera [[Marc Albrecht]] while Ernst Albrecht was the father of the President of the European Commission [[Ursula von der Leyen]] (née Albrecht) and of the businessman [[Hans-Holger Albrecht]].<ref name="Geschlechterbuch1910">{{cite book |last= |first= |year=1910 |title=[[Deutsches Geschlechterbuch]] |url= |location= |publisher= | volume= 17 |page= |isbn= |author-link=}}</ref><ref name="Geschlechterbuch1982">{{cite book |last= |first= |year= 1982|title=[[Deutsches Geschlechterbuch]] |url= |location= |publisher= | volume= 187 |page=43 |isbn= |author-link=}}</ref><ref>[https://www.weser-kurier.de/bremen/bremen-stadt_artikel,-Ehrengast-mit-Bremer-Wurzeln-_arid,1055918.html Ehrengast mit Bremer Wurzeln]</ref>
