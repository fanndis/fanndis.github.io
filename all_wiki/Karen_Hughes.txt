'''Karen Parfitt Hughes''' (born December 27, 1956) is the global vice chair of the public relations firm [[Burson-Marsteller]]. She served as the [[Under Secretary of State for Public Diplomacy and Public Affairs]] in the U.S. [[United States Department of State|Department of State]] and as a counsellor to President [[George W. Bush]].

==Early life==
Born in [[Paris]], [[France]], Hughes is the daughter of the American parents Patricia Rose (Scully) and [[Harold Parfitt (Panama Canal)|Harold Parfitt]],<ref>http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.com/~battle/celeb/hughes.htm</ref> the last [[List of Governors of Panama Canal Zone|U.S. Governor of the Panama Canal Zone]]. After graduating from [[W. T. White High School]] in [[Dallas, Texas]], Hughes earned a [[bachelor's degree]] at [[Southern Methodist University]] in 1977 where she was a member of [[Alpha Delta Pi]] sorority. She is of partial Irish and English descent.

==Early career==
Hughes worked as a television news reporter from 1977 to 1984. As a reporter, Hughes followed the [[U.S. presidential election, 1980|1980 presidential campaign]]. In 1984, she went to work as the Texas press coordinator for the [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]]-[[George H.W. Bush|Bush]] campaign in the [[1984 United States presidential election|1984  United States presidential election]].  She later became executive director of the [[Republican Party of Texas]].

==White House==
[[File:Karen Hughes and Laura Bush.jpg|right|thumb|Karen Hughes with First Lady [[Laura Bush]], June 28, 2002]]

Since 1994, Hughes has worked with [[George W. Bush]], first as director of his campaign for the office of [[governor of Texas]], and then as a [[Wikt:counselor|counselor]] from 2001 to 2002, while he was [[President of the United States]].

Hughes left the [[George W. Bush|Bush administration]] in July 2002 to return to Texas, but remained in daily contact with the Bush reelection campaign by [[telephone]] and [[e-mail]], and spoke personally with Bush several times a week. In August 2004, Hughes returned to full-time service with the [[George W. Bush presidential campaign, 2004|Bush campaign]], setting up office on [[Air Force One]], from where she planned the [[2004 Republican National Convention]] and the late stages of the [[U.S. presidential election, 2004|2004 election]]. She has been praised by ''[[The Dallas Morning News]]'' as "the most powerful woman ever to serve in the [[White House]]", and by [[ABC News]] as Bush's "most essential advisor."

==''Ten Minutes from Normal''==
In March 2004, Hughes published ''Ten Minutes from Normal'', which includes an account of her decision to leave the White House.  While promoting her book, she appeared on [[CNN]] on April 25, 2004 - the same day as the [[March for Women's Lives]] - and said "I think after [[September 11 attacks|September 11th]] the American people are valuing life more and realizing that we need policies to value the dignity and worth of every life. And President Bush has worked to say, let's be reasonable, let's work to value life, let's try to reduce the number of [[abortion]]s, let's increase [[adoption]]s.  And I think those are the kind of policies that the American people can support, particularly at a time when we're facing an enemy, and really the fundamental difference between us and the [[terrorism|terror]] network we fight is that we value every life. It's the founding conviction of our country, that we're endowed by our creator with certain unalienable rights, the right to life and liberty and the pursuit of happiness."<ref>[http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0404/25/le.00.html CNN.com - Transcripts]</ref>

==State Department==

On March 14, 2005, Bush announced his intention to nominate Hughes for the undersecretary of [[Department of State|state]] for [[public diplomacy]] with the rank of ambassador &mdash; a job focused on changing foreigners' perceptions about America.  The [[United States Senate|Senate]] confirmed her nomination in July 2005.<ref>https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/07/30/AR2005073000040.html</ref>
In her new capacity, Hughes spoke of improving the world's perception of the United States via creation of a "rapid-response unit" and a plan to "forward-deploy regional [[SWAT]] teams". During a [[town hall meeting]] on September 8, 2005, a [[State Department]] employee complained that "recently, we've had tremendous amount of difficulty in some cases getting clearance for our ambassadors to speak." Hughes replied, "If they make statements based on something I sent them, they're not going to be called on the carpet."<ref>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/09/08/AR2005090801788.html Hughes Is Varnishing the Nation's Tarnish]</ref>

At the end of her tenure in the State Department, Hughes said that one of her greatest accomplishments had been "transforming [[public diplomacy]] and making it a [[national security]] priority central to everything we do in government".<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/7071638.stm BBC NEWS | World | Americas | Key Bush image adviser to leave]</ref> Hughes was the keynote speaker at the October 22, 2007, [[Public Relations Society of America]]'s International Conference and discussed, "Waging Peace -- The New Paradigm for Public Diplomacy." <ref>[http://www.prsa.org/conf2007/news/index.cfm?niid=5 2007 PRSA International Conference] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071214221938/http://www.prsa.org/conf2007/news/index.cfm?niid=5 |date=December 14, 2007 }}</ref>

==2005 tour of the Middle East==
Starting with a September 26, 2005, stop in [[Egypt]], Hughes went on a "listening tour" of the [[Middle East]] to speak with leaders and people from the region.<ref>[https://2001-2009.state.gov/r/us/2005/54062.htm Briefing En Route Ankara, Turkey]</ref> This was a response to growing fears in America about rampant [[anti-Americanism]] in the Middle East. Hughes was the third person chosen for this task by President Bush, following unsuccessful attempts by [[Charlotte Beers]] and [[Margaret Tutwiler]].<ref>[http://www.slate.com/id/2127102/ Karen Hughes, Stay Home! - Slate]</ref> For her tour, Hughes asked two Citizen Ambassadors to accompany her: a college student, Tina Karima Daoud, and William O'Brien, a retired high school geography teacher.

On her September 27 stop in [[Jeddah]], [[Saudi Arabia]], during a talk with female students, she expressed her wish that women could "fully participate in society" as they do in the United States. In response one of the women said, "The general image of the [[Arab]] woman is that she isn't happy [...] Well, we're all pretty happy."<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/28/international/middleeast/28hughes.html?ex=1187409600&en=253f58b29eb5383f&ei=5070 Saudi Women Have Message for U.S. Envoy - New York Times]</ref>

In a press conference in [[Jakarta]], [[Indonesia]], Hughes incorrectly stated that [[Saddam Hussein]] "had murdered hundreds of thousands of his own people using poison gas."<ref>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/10/21/AR2005102101870.html Hughes Misreports Iraqi History<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Conventional sources attest that Saddam did order the deaths of several hundred thousand Iraqis during the [[al-Anfal Campaign]] and other violent suppressions, but casualties from his infamous [[Halabja poison gas attack|gas attack on Halabja]] numbered in the thousands.

==Breast cancer research advocacy==
Hughes met business representatives from the [[United Arab Emirates]] (U.A.E.) to create the U.S.-U.A.E. Partnership for Breast Cancer Awareness and Research. It will develop [[breast cancer awareness]] campaigns and expand research in the [[Middle East]] by linking U.S. medical experts, fundraisers, health research activists, and businesses with their U.A.E. counterparts.<ref>[http://www.america.gov/st/washfile-english/2006/November/20061101171410berehellek0.9478571.html State's Hughes Joins Dubai Businesswomen To Fight Breast Cancer] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101128122237/http://www.america.gov/st/washfile-english/2006/November/20061101171410berehellek0.9478571.html |date=November 28, 2010 }}</ref>

==Post White House==
In late October 2007, Hughes made it known that she would be resigning from her position in the Bush White House.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7071638.stm BBC NEWS | Americas | Key Bush image adviser to leave]</ref> Secretary of State [[Condoleezza Rice]] was quoted as saying she accepted the resignation "with a great deal of sadness but also a great deal of happiness for what she has achieved."

Hughes is currently the global vice chair of [[Burson-Marsteller]], a public relations company.<ref>Burson-Marsteller (2009).
