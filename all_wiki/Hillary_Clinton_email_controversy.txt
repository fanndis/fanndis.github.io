{{Hillary Clinton series}}
During [[Hillary Clinton's tenure as Secretary of State|her tenure as United States Secretary of State]], [[Hillary Clinton]] drew controversy by using a private [[email server]] for official public communications rather than using official [[United States Department of State|State Department]] email accounts maintained on secure federal servers. An [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] examination of Clinton's server found over 100 emails containing classified information, including 65 emails deemed "Secret" and 22 deemed "Top Secret". An additional 2,093 emails not marked classified were retroactively marked classified by the State Department.{{by whom?|date=October 2020}}

Some experts, officials, and members of [[United States Congress|Congress]] contended that Clinton's use of a private [[Message transfer agent|messaging system]] and a private server violated federal law, specifically 18 U.S. Code § 1924, regarding the unauthorized removal and retention of classified documents or materials, as well as State Department protocols and procedures, and regulations governing [[recordkeeping]]. Clinton responded that her use complied with federal laws and State Department regulations, and that former secretaries of state had also maintained personal email accounts. News reports by [[NBC News|NBC]] and [[CNN]] indicated that the emails discussed "innocuous" matters already available in the public domain. For example, the [[Drone strikes in Pakistan|CIA drone program]] has been widely discussed in the public domain since the early 2000s; however, the existence of the program is technically classified, so sharing a newspaper article that mentions it would constitute a security breach, according to the CIA.<ref name="secrecy defines"/><ref>{{cite web |title=DoD Warns Employees of Classified Info in Public Domain |work=Federation of American Scientists |date=June 11, 2013 |first=Steven |last=Aftergood |url=https://fas.org/blogs/secrecy/2013/06/dod-classified/ }}</ref>

The controversy was a major point of discussion and contention during the [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 presidential election]], in which Clinton was the Democratic nominee. In May, the [[Office of the Inspector General of the Department of State|State Department's Office of the Inspector General]] released a report about the State Department's email practices, including Clinton's. In July, FBI director [[James Comey]] announced that the FBI investigation had concluded that Clinton had been "extremely careless" but recommended that no charges be filed because Clinton did not act with [[Intention (criminal law)|criminal intent]], the historical standard for pursuing prosecution.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://time.com/4394178/hillary-clinton-email-fbi-investigation/|title=Why the FBI Let Hillary Clinton Off the Hook|website=Time}}</ref> Clinton's opponent, [[Donald Trump]], used the nickname "Crooked Hillary" to criticize Clinton.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trumps-nicknames-for-rivals-from-rocket-man-to-pocahontas |title=Trump's nicknames for rivals, from 'Rocket Man' to 'Pocahontas'|first=Kaitlyn|last=Schallhorn|date=April 17, 2018|publisher=Fox News|access-date=April 21, 2018}}</ref>

===Initial awareness===
As early as 2009, officials with the [[National Archives and Records Administration]] (NARA) expressed concerns over possible violations of normal federal government record-keeping procedures at the State Department under then-Secretary Clinton.<ref>{{cite web|last=Gerstein|first=Josh|url=https://www.politico.com/story/2015/03/state-department-email-rule-hillary-clinton-115804|title=Clinton private email violated 'clear-cut' State Dept. rules|publisher=Politico.com|date=March 6, 2015|access-date=April 1, 2015}}</ref>

In December 2012, near the end of Clinton's tenure as Secretary of State, a nonprofit group called [[Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington]], or CREW, filed a [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|FOIA]] request seeking records about her email. CREW received a response in May 2013: "no records responsive to your request were located."<ref name="WP032716"/> Emails sent to Clinton's private clintonemail.com address were first discovered in March 2013, when a hacker named "[[Guccifer]]" widely distributed emails sent to Clinton from [[Sidney Blumenthal]], which Guccifer obtained by illegally accessing Blumenthal's email account.<ref name=":0">{{cite web|title=Hacker Begins Distributing Confidential Memos Sent To Hillary Clinton On Libya, Benghazi Attack|url=http://www.thesmokinggun.com/buster/sidney-blumenthal/hacker-distributes-memos-784091|website=The Smoking Gun|access-date=September 30, 2015|date = March 18, 2013}}</ref><ref name=":1">{{cite web|title=Hacked Emails Show Hillary Clinton Was Receiving Advice at a Private Email Account From Banned, Obama-Hating Former Staffer |url=http://gawker.com/5991563/hacked-emails-show-hillary-clinton-was-receiving-advice-at-a-private-email-account-from-banned-obama-hating-former-staffer |access-date=September 30, 2015 |first=John |last=Cook |website=Gawker |date=March 20, 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151001023951/http://gawker.com/5991563/hacked-emails-show-hillary-clinton-was-receiving-advice-at-a-private-email-account-from-banned-obama-hating-former-staffer |archive-date=October 1, 2015  }}</ref><ref name=":2">{{cite web|title='Guccifer' hacks Hillary Clinton's e-emails via aide's account|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2013/03/19/guccifer-hacker-hillary-clinton-sidney-blumenthal-george-hw-bush/2001429/|access-date=September 30, 2015|website=USA Today|date=March 22, 2013|last=Acohido|first=Byron}}</ref> The emails dealt with the [[2012 Benghazi attack]] and other issues in [[Libya]] and revealed the existence of her clintonemail.com address.<ref name=":0"/><ref name=":1"/><ref name=":2"/>

In the summer of 2014, lawyers from the State Department noticed a number of emails from Clinton's personal account, while reviewing documents requested by the House Select Committee on Benghazi. A request by the State Department for additional emails led to negotiations with her lawyers and advisors. In October, the State Department sent letters to Clinton and all previous Secretaries of State back to [[Madeleine Albright]] requesting emails and documents related to their work while in office. On December 5, 2014, Clinton lawyers delivered 12 file boxes filled with printed paper containing more than 30,000 emails.

According to Harf, use by government officials of personal email for government business is permissible under the [[Federal Records Act]], so long as relevant official communications, including all work-related emails, are preserved by the agency. The Act (which was [[Presidential and Federal Records Act Amendments of 2014|amended in late 2014]] after Clinton left office to require that personal emails be transferred to government servers within 20 days) requires agencies to retain all official communications, including all work-related emails, and stipulates that government employees cannot destroy or remove relevant records.<ref name="MontanaroFactCheck"/> NARA regulations dictate how records should be created and maintained, require that they must be maintained "by the agency" and "readily found," and that the records must "make possible a proper scrutiny by the Congress."<ref name="MontanaroFactCheck"/> Section 1924 of [[Title 18 of the United States Code]] addresses the deletion and retention of classified documents, under which "knowingly" removing or housing classified information at an "unauthorized location" is subject to a fine, or up to a year in prison.<ref name="MontanaroFactCheck"/>

Inspector General Linick wrote that he "found no evidence that staff in the Office of the Legal Adviser reviewed or approved Secretary Clinton's personal system," and also found that multiple State employees who raised concerns regarding Clinton's server were told that the Office of the Legal Adviser had approved it, and were further told to "never speak of the Secretary's personal email system again."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/2016/5/25/11771850/hillary-clinton-emails-inspector-general-report|title=What the new inspector general report on Hillary Clinton's emails actually says|author=Andrew Prokop|date=May 25, 2016|work=Vox}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/05/26/opinions/clinton-email-server-ig-report-opinion-cox/|title=Hillary Clinton's shrinking email defense|author=Douglas Cox|date=May 26, 2016|publisher=CNN}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/05/state-department-hillary-clinton-violated-record-keeping-rules|title=State Department Inspector General Finds Hillary Clinton Violated Recordkeeping Rules|work=Mother Jones}}</ref><ref name="nyt review"/>

==Deletion of emails==

In 2014, months prior to public knowledge of the server's existence, Clinton chief of staff [[Cheryl Mills]] and two attorneys worked to identify work-related emails on the server to be archived and preserved for the State Department. Upon completion of this task in December 2014, Mills instructed Clinton's computer services provider, Platte River Networks (PRN), to change the server's [[retention period]] to 60 days, allowing 31,830 older personal emails to be automatically deleted from the server, as Clinton had decided she no longer needed them. However, the PRN technician assigned for this task failed to carry it out at that time.<ref name="factcheck.org">{{cite web|url=https://www.factcheck.org/2016/09/the-fbi-files-on-clintons-emails/|title=The FBI Files on Clinton's Emails - FactCheck.org|date=September 7, 2016|access-date=August 30, 2018}}</ref>

After the existence of the server became publicly known on March 2, 2015,<ref name="nytimes.com"/> the [[Select Committee on Benghazi]] issued a subpoena for Benghazi-related emails two days later.

An interagency dispute arose during the investigation about what constitutes “classified” status when information acquired and considered “owned” by intelligence agencies is also independently and publicly available through “parallel reporting” by the press or others. In one reported instance, an email chain deemed by the intelligence community to contain classified information included a discussion of a ''New York Times'' article that reported on a CIA drone strike in Pakistan; despite wide public knowledge of the drone program, the CIA — as the "owning agency" — considers the very existence of its drone program to be classified in its entirety. [[Assistant Secretary of State for Legislative Affairs]] [[Julia Frifield]] noted, "When policy officials obtain information from open sources, ‘think tanks,’ experts, foreign government officials, or others, the fact that some of the information may also have been available through intelligence channels does not mean that the information is necessarily classified.”<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/06/us/politics/agencies-battle-over-what-is-top-secret-in-hillary-clintons-emails.html|title=Agencies Battle Over What Is 'Top Secret' in Hillary Clinton's Emails|first1=Steven Lee|last1=Myers|first2=Mark|last2=Mazzetti|date=February 5, 2016|newspaper=The New York Times }}</ref><ref name="secrecy defines">{{Cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/secrecy-defines-obamas-drone-war/2011/10/28/gIQAPKNR5O_story.html|title=Secrecy defines Obama's drone war|first=Karen |last=DeYoung |date=December 19, 2011 |newspaper=The Washington Post |access-date=April 23, 2020 }}</ref>

===State Department inspector general reports and statements===
A June 29, 2015, memorandum from the Inspector General of the State Department, Steve A. Linick, said that a review of the 55,000-page email release found "hundreds of potentially classified emails."<ref name=CNN3>{{cite news |last=Labott |first=Elise |url=https://www.cnn.com/2015/07/24/politics/hillary-clinton-email-justice-department |title=Clinton emails Included Classified Information |work=CNN |date=July 24, 2015 }}</ref> A July 17, 2015, follow-up memo, sent jointly by Linick and the [[United States Intelligence Community|Intelligence Community]] (IC) inspector general, I. Charles McCullough III, to [[Under Secretary of State for Management]] [[Patrick F. Kennedy]], stated that they had confirmed that several of the emails contained classified information that was not marked as classified, at least one of which was publicly released.<ref name=CNN3/>

On July 24, 2015, Linick and McCullough said they had discovered classified information on Clinton's email account,<ref name=NYT72415>{{cite news|author1=Michael S.

In a separate statement in the form of a letter to Congress, McCullough said that he had made a request to the State Department for access to the entire set of emails turned over by Clinton, but that the Department rejected his request.<ref name=NYT72415/><ref name=WSJ3>{{cite news |first=Byron |last=Tau |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/investigation-sought-into-hillary-clintons-emails-1437714369 |title=Hillary Clinton Sent Classified Information Over Email While at State Department |newspaper=The Wall Street Journal |date=July 24, 2015 }}</ref> The letter stated that none of the emails were marked as classified, but because they included classified information they should have been marked and handled as such, and transmitted securely.<ref name=WSJ3/>

On August 10, 2015, the IC inspector general said that two of the 40 emails in the sample were "Top Secret/[[Sensitive Compartmented Information]]" and subsequently given classified labels of "TK" (for "Talent Keyhole," indicating material obtained by aerial or space-based imagery sources and [[NOFORN]]).<ref name=AP81415 /> One is a discussion of a news article about a [[Drone strikes in Pakistan|U.S. drone strike operation]].<ref name=AP81415/> The second, he said, either referred to classified material or else was "parallel reporting" of [[open-source intelligence]], which might still be classified by the government "owning agency" that sourced the information by secret means even though the same information was also available in the public domain.<ref name=AP81415/><ref>{{cite news|agency=Associated Press|title=US State Department 'Top secret' emails on Clinton server discussed drone program, reference classified info.|url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/08/14/top-secret-emails-on-clinton-server-discussed-drone-program-may-reference/ |access-date=August 24, 2015|publisher=Fox News Channel|date=August 14, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150815003955/http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/08/14/top-secret-emails-on-clinton-server-discussed-drone-program-may-reference/|archive-date=August 15, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/06/us/politics/agencies-battle-over-what-is-top-secret-in-hillary-clintons-emails.html|title=Agencies Battle Over What Is 'Top Secret' in Hillary Clinton's Emails|date=February 5, 2016|access-date=April 21, 2018|via=NYTimes.com}}</ref> Clinton's presidential campaign and the State Department disputed the letter, and questioned whether the emails had been over-classified by an arbitrary process.

The IC inspector general issued another letter to Congress on January 14, 2016. In this letter he stated that an unnamed intelligence agency had made a sworn declaration that "several dozen emails [had been] determined by the IC element to be at the CONFIDENTIAL, SECRET, and TOP SECRET/[[Special access program|SAP]] levels."

On January 29, 2016, the State Department announced that 22 documents from Clinton's email server would not be released because they contained highly classified information that was too sensitive for public consumption.

The State Department and [[United States Intelligence Community|Intelligence Community]] (IC) inspector generals' discovery of four emails containing classified information, out of a random sample of 40, prompted them to make a security referral to the FBI's counterintelligence office, to alert authorities that classified information was being kept on Clinton's server and by her lawyer on a [[USB flash drive|thumb drive]].<ref name=NYT72415 /><ref name=WSJ3/> As part of the FBI's '''Midyear investigation''',<ref name=OIGjune2018>{{cite web |title=A Review of Various Actions by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and Department of Justice in Advance of the 2016 Election |url=https://www.justice.gov/file/1071991/download |publisher=[[Office of the Inspector General]] |access-date=May 19, 2019 |pages=328, 330, 397}}</ref> at the request of the IC [[inspector general]], Clinton agreed to turn over her email server to the [[U.S. Department of Justice]], as well as thumb drives containing copies of her work-related emails.

In late June 2016, it was reported that Bill Clinton met privately with Attorney General [[Loretta Lynch]] on her private plane on the tarmac at [[Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport]]. Officials indicated that the 30 minute meeting took place when Clinton became aware that Lynch's plane was on the same tarmac at the airport. When the meeting became public, Lynch stated that it was "primarily social" and "there was no discussion of any matter pending for the department or any matter pending for any other body." Lynch was criticized for her involvement in the meeting and was called on by some critics to recuse herself from involvement in the FBI's investigation of the email case. In response, she stated "The F.B.I. is investigating whether Mrs. Clinton, her aides or anyone else broke the law by setting up a private email server for her to use as secretary of state," but "the case will be resolved by the same team that has been working on it from the beginning" and "I will be accepting their recommendations."<ref name="https">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/02/us/politics/loretta-lynch-hillary-clinton-email-server.html|title=Lynch to Accept F.B.I.

Clinton maintained she did not send or receive any confidential emails from her personal server. In a Democratic debate with [[Bernie Sanders]] on February 4, 2016, Clinton said, "I never sent or received any classified material."

With regard to mishandling of classified information, Comey said, "there is evidence that they [Clinton and her team] were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information."

The FBI learned that Clinton used her personal email extensively while outside the United States, both sending and receiving work-related emails in the territory of sophisticated adversaries. The FBI did not find "direct evidence that Secretary Clinton's personal e-mail domain ... was successfully hacked;" they assessed it "possible that hostile actors gained access" to it.<ref name=Comey/><ref name=ZapHel/> Investigators found that State Department employees often used private emails to conduct business.

====October 2016 – Additional investigation====
In early October 2016, FBI criminal investigators working on a case involving former Congressman [[Anthony Weiner]] allegedly [[Anthony Weiner sexting scandals|sending sexually explicit texts to a fifteen-year-old girl]] discovered emails from Weiner's estranged wife, [[Huma Abedin]], vice chair of Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign, that they considered potentially relevant to the Clinton server investigation.

On October 28, 2016, Comey informed Congress that "in connection with an unrelated case, the FBI has learned of the existence of emails that appear pertinent to the investigation." He said the FBI will take "appropriate investigative steps designed to allow investigators to review these emails to determine whether they contain classified information, as well as to assess their importance to our investigation."

=== Senate probes Loretta Lynch interference ===
According to Comey's June 8, 2017, testimony to the Senate Intelligence Committee, then-Attorney General Loretta Lynch had asked him to downplay the investigation into Clinton's emails by calling it a "matter" rather than an investigation.

The material was considered classified then or later, but none of the violations involved information marked classified. The investigation found Clinton's use of personal email server increased the risk of compromising State Department information, but "there was no persuasive evidence of systemic, deliberate mishandling of classified information".<ref>{{cite news |last1=Lee |first1=Matthew |last2=Jalonick |first2=Mary Clare |title=38 people cited for violations in Clinton email probe |url=https://www.apnews.com/14b14afc5d8647858489a2cf5385c28d |work=The Associated Press |date=October 19, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/state-department-probe-of-clinton-emails-finds-no-deliberate-mishandling-of-classified-information/2019/10/18/83339446-f1dc-11e9-8693-f487e46784aa_story.html|title=State Department probe of Clinton emails finds no deliberate mishandling of classified information|website=Washington Post}}</ref>

=== Department of Justice Inspector General's report ===

{{main|Inspector General report on FBI and DOJ actions in the 2016 election}}

The [[Inspector General of the Department of Justice]] (IG) launched an investigation into how the DOJ and FBI had handled the investigation into Clinton's email. On June 14, 2018, the IG issued a report that was highly critical of Comey's actions.<ref name="highlights" /> Regarding his July press conference, in which he criticized Clinton even while announcing the investigation was over, the IG said it was "extraordinary and insubordinate for Comey to conceal his intentions (about the press conference) from his superiors," and that "we found none of his reasons to be a persuasive basis for deviating from well-established Department policies."<ref name = slams>{{cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/doj-watchdog-slams-insubordinate-james-comey-over-clinton-email_us_5b22a82be4b0d4fc01fc61e6|title=DOJ Watchdog Slams 'Insubordinate' James Comey Over Clinton Email News Conference|last=Reilly|first=Ryan J.|date=June 14, 2018|work=Huffington Post|access-date=June 16, 2018}}</ref> Comey's October decision to send a letter notifying Congress that the investigation had been re-opened one week before the election was described as "[[ad-hoc]]" and "a serious error in judgment."<ref name = slams/> However, in June 2018 the IG concluded that the decision to not prosecute Clinton was not affected by bias and "was consistent with the Department’s historical approach in prior cases under different leadership, including in the 2008 decision not to prosecute former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales for mishandling classified documents."<ref name=cnn-comey14-6-18>{{cite news|url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/06/14/politics/ig-report-clinton-email-investigation/index.html|title=Comey's actions 'extraordinary and insubordinate,' report says|date=June 14, 2018|work=CNN|access-date=June 16, 2018}}</ref><ref>A Review of Various Actions by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and Department of Justice in Advance of the 2016 Election, Office of the Inspector General, p. vi: https://www.justice.gov/file/1071991/download</ref>

The IG report also commented on "highly classified information" in a purported Russian intelligence document obtained by the FBI that included an unconfirmed allegation that Attorney General [[Loretta Lynch]] assured a Clinton staffer that she would prevent the FBI investigation from digging too deeply into Clinton's affairs. The FBI long considered the document unreliable and a possible forgery, and Comey told IG investigators he knew the information was not true.<ref name=wapo-24-5-2017>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/how-a-dubious-russian-document-influenced-the-fbis-handling-of-the-clinton-probe/2017/05/24/f375c07c-3a95-11e7-9e48-c4f199710b69_story.html |title=How a dubious Russian document influenced the FBI's handling of the Clinton probe |date=May 24, 2017 |access-date=January 22, 2018 |last1=Demirjian |first1=Karoun   |last2=Barrett |first2=Devlin }}</ref> The IG report stated: "Comey said that he became concerned that the information about Lynch would taint the public's perception of the [Clinton] investigation if it leaked, particularly after DCLeaks and Guccifer 2.0 began releasing hacked emails in mid-June 2016," explaining why Comey chose to bypass Lynch and deputy AG [[Sally Yates]] to announce the FBI investigation findings himself.<ref name="EWING-16-June-2018">{{cite news |last1=EWING |first1=PHILIP |title=The Russia Investigations: What The Justice IG Report Revealed |url=https://www.npr.org/2018/06/16/620345643/the-russia-investigations-what-the-justice-ig-report-revealed |access-date=January 11, 2019 |agency=NPR |date=June 16, 2018}}</ref> The ''[[Washington Post]]'' also stated that "current and former officials" told them that Comey relied on the questionable document in making his July decision to announce on his own without his superiors approval that the investigation was over.<ref name=wapo-24-5-2017/>

===Opinions of journalists and experts===
According to the ''New York Times'', if Clinton was a recipient of classified emails, "it is not clear that she would have known that they contained government secrets, since they were not marked classified."<ref name=Allen0821>{{cite web|last1=Allen|first1= Jonathan|title=Exclusive: Dozens of Clinton emails were classified from the start, U.S. rules suggest|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/08/21/us-usa-election-clinton-emails-idUSKCN0QQ0BW20150821|agency=Reuters|access-date=August 28, 2015|date=August 21, 2015}}</ref><ref name=NYT72415/> The newspaper reported that "most specialists believe the occasional appearance of classified information in the Clinton account was probably of marginal consequence".<ref name=NYT8815/> Steven Aftergood, director of the Project on Government Secrecy at the [[Federation of American Scientists]], said that inadvertent "spillage" of classified information into an unclassified realm is a common occurrence.<ref name="NYT8815"/>

[[Reuters]]' August 2015 review of a set of released emails found "at least 30 email threads from 2009, representing scores of individual emails," which include what the State Department identifies as "foreign government information," defined by the U.S. government as "any information, written or spoken, provided in confidence to U.S. officials by their foreign counterparts." Although unmarked, Reuters' examination appeared to suggest that these emails "were classified from the start."<ref name=Allen0821/> [[J. William Leonard]], a former director of the NARA [[Information Security Oversight Office]], said that such information is "born classified" and that "[I]f a foreign minister just told the secretary of state something in confidence, by U.S. rules that is classified at the moment it's in U.S. channels and U.S. possession."<ref name=Allen0821/> According to Reuters, the standard U.S. government [[nondisclosure agreement]] "warns people authorized to handle classified information that it may not be marked that way and that it may come in oral form." The State Department "disputed Reuters' analysis" but declined to elaborate.<ref name=Allen0821/>

The [[Associated Press]] reported, "Some officials said they believed the designations were a stretch—a knee-jerk move in a bureaucracy rife with over-classification."<ref name=AP81415/> [[Jeffrey Toobin]], in an August 2015 ''[[The New Yorker|New Yorker]]'' article, wrote that the Clinton email affair is an illustration of overclassification, a problem written about by Senator [[Daniel Patrick Moynihan]] in his book ''Secrecy: The American Experience''.<ref name="Toobin">{{cite news |first=Jeffrey |last=Toobin |url=https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/hillarys-problem-the-government-classifies-everything |title=Hillary's Problem: The Government Classifies Everything |work=The New Yorker |date=August 18, 2015 |access-date=April 23, 2020 }}</ref> Toobin writes that "government bureaucracies use classification rules to protect turf, to avoid embarrassment, to embarrass rivals—in short, for a variety of motives that have little to do with national security."<ref name="Toobin"/> Toobin wrote that "It's not only the public who cannot know the extent or content of government secrecy. Realistically, government officials can't know either—and this is Hillary Clinton's problem. Toobin noted that "one of Clinton's potentially classified email exchanges is nothing more than a discussion of a newspaper story about [[Drone strikes in Pakistan|drones]]" and wrote: "That such a discussion could be classified underlines the absurdity of the current system. But that is the system that exists, and if and when the agencies determine that she sent or received classified information through her private server, Clinton will be accused of mishandling national-security secrets."<ref name="Toobin"/>

In an analysis of the Clinton email controversy published by the [[Brookings Institution]], Richard Lempert wrote that "security professionals have a reputation for erring in the direction of overclassification."<ref name="German">{{cite news |last=German |first=Ben |url=http://www.nationaljournal.com/twentysixteen/2015/08/19/other-top-secret-problem-hurting-hillary-clinton |title=The Other 'Top Secret' Problem Hurting Hillary Clinton |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151017184847/http://www.nationaljournal.com/twentysixteen/2015/08/19/other-top-secret-problem-hurting-hillary-clinton |archive-date=October 17, 2015 |url-status=dead |work=National Journal |date=August 19, 2015 |access-date=October 25, 2015 }}</ref> Elizabeth Goitein, co-director of the liberty and national security program at the [[Brennan Center for Justice]] at [[New York University School of Law]], says that "The odds are good that any classified information in the Clinton emails should not have been classified," since an estimated 50 percent to 90 percent of classified documents could be made public without risking national security.<ref name="German" /> Nate Jones, an expert with the [[National Security Archive]] at [[George Washington University]], said: "Clinton's mistreatment of federal records and the intelligence community's desire to retroactively overclassify are two distinct troubling problems. No politician is giving the right message: Blame Clinton for poor records practices, but don't embrace overclassification while you do it."<ref name="German" />

====Russian intelligence and Comey's pronouncements====
A number of journalists (Philip Ewing<ref name="EWING-16-June-2018"/> and [[Jane Mayer]]<ref name="mayer-1-10-18">{{cite magazine |last1=Jane |first1=Mayer |title=How Russia Helped Swing the Election for Trump |url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/10/01/how-russia-helped-to-swing-the-election-for-trump |access-date=December 23, 2018 |magazine=New Yorker |date=October 1, 2018}}</ref> [[Karoun Demirjian]] and Devlin Barrett)<ref name=wapo-24-5-2017/> have commented on the connection between the alleged Russian intelligence document given to the FBI that suggested Attorney General [[Loretta Lynch]] would prevent the FBI investigation from digging too deeply into Clinton's affairs (see above), and Comey's July announcement of the FBI investigation findings by himself without Lynch's permission,<ref name="EWING-16-June-2018"/><ref name="mayer-1-10-18"/> which was later called "extraordinary and insubordinate" by the [[Inspector General report on FBI and DOJ actions in the 2016 election|Department of Justice Inspector General's report]].<ref name=cnn-comey14-6-18/> "Current and former officials" told Washington Post reporters Demirjian and Barrett that “Comey relied on the document in making his July decision to announce on his own,” because he feared its contents would be leaked, tainting the public's perception of the FBI investigation.<ref name=wapo-24-5-2017/> This was despite the fact that Comey himself told investigators “he knew from the first moment” that the document “wasn't true”<ref name="EWING-16-June-2018"/> and the FBI was later unable to corroborate the document.<ref name="EWING-16-June-2018"/>

Ewing and Mayer note the document's effect on the election. According to Ewing, "to the degree" that the document "was intended to help disrupt the election, it worked".<ref name="EWING-16-June-2018"/> Jane Mayer describes the work of political scientist [[Kathleen Hall Jamieson]] who argues that Comey’s "damaging public pronouncements" on Clinton’s handling of classified e-mails" in July and later ten days before the election can "plausibly be attributed to Russian disinformation".<ref name="mayer-1-10-18"/> While it is difficult to determine how many voters Clinton lost from the pronouncements, Mayer also quotes the Democratic ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, [[Adam Schiff]], who states that if "the fake intelligence" motivated Comey, then the document was "probably was the most measurable" and "the most significant way in which the Russians may have impacted the outcome of the election."<ref name="mayer-1-10-18"/>

==House Oversight Committee hearing==
On July 7, 2016, Comey was questioned for 5 hours by the [[United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform]].

In a Meet the Press interview on July 2, 2016, Clinton stated: "Let me repeat what I have repeated for many months now, I never received nor sent any material that was marked classified."<ref name="auto"/><ref name="politifact.com"/><ref name="washingtonpost.com1"/>

In an interview with Fox News in late July 2016, Clinton stated "Director Comey said my answers were truthful, and what I've said is consistent with what I have told the American people, that there were decisions discussed and made to classify retroactively certain of the emails." The Washington Post awarded Clinton four "Pinocchios", its worst rating, for her statement saying "While Comey did say there was no evidence she lied to the FBI, that is not the same as saying she told the truth to the American public."<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2016/07/31/clintons-claim-that-the-fbi-director-said-her-email-answers-were-truthful/ |title=Clinton's claim that the FBI director at the time, James Comey, said that Clinton's email answers were 'truthful' |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=July 31, 2016 |first=Glenn |last=Kessler }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://edition.cnn.com/2016/08/01/politics/washington-post-clinton-four-pinnochios-comey-emails/index.html |title=Washington Post hits Clinton with four 'Pinnochios' on emails |work=CNN |date=August 1, 2016 |first=David |last=Wright }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://nation.foxnews.com/2016/08/01/wapo-gives-hillary-four-pinocchios-claiming-comey-called-her-truthful-about-her-emails |title=WaPo Gives Hillary Four Pinocchios For Claiming Comey Called Her Truthful About Her Emails |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160819034501/http://nation.foxnews.com/2016/08/01/wapo-gives-hillary-four-pinocchios-claiming-comey-called-her-truthful-about-her-emails |archive-date=August 19, 2016 |work=Fox News Channel |date=August 1, 2016 }}</ref>

In her 2017 book ''What Happened?'', Clinton argued that the email controversy and FBI Director James Comey's actions contributed to her loss. A 2019 study in the journal ''Perspectives on Politics'' found little evidence to support the hypothesis.<ref name=":02">{{Cite journal|last1=Quinlan|first1=Stephen|last2=Lewis-Beck|first2=Michael S.|date=2019|title=The Hillary Hypotheses: Testing Candidate Views of Loss|journal=Perspectives on Politics|volume=17|issue=3|pages=646–665|doi=10.1017/S153759271800347X|issn=1537-5927|doi-access=free}}</ref>

In [[Venice]] at the "Hillary: The Hillary Clinton Emails," a work on display in a balcony jutting out over a supermarket at the Despar Teatro Italia during the [[58th Venice Biennale|58th Biennale of Visual Arts]], Clinton made a surprise visit on Tuesday September 10, 2019, to this work of political theater and performance art. The exhibition created by the American poet and artist [[Kenneth Goldsmith]] was displayed from May 9, 2019, until November 24, 2019, curated by Francesco Urbano Ragazzi. During her appearance, she said that the attention given to her emails was one of the "strangest" and most "absurd" events in U.S. political history, adding, "Anyone can go in and look at them. There is nothing there. There is nothing that should have been so controversial."<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.staradvertiser.com/2019/09/12/breaking-news/hillary-clinton-reads-her-emails-at-venice-art-show/ |title=Hillary Clinton reads her emails at Venice art show |newspaper=[[Star-Advertiser]] |location=[[Honolulu]] |via=[[New York Times]] |date=September 12, 2019 |access-date=September 13, 2019 |agency=Associated Press }}</ref>

===Democratic response===
In August 2015, the ''New York Times'' reported on "interviews with more than 75 Democratic governors, lawmakers, candidates and party members" on the email issue.<ref name="FrustratesDems">{{cite news |first1=Patrick |last1=Healy |first2=Jonathan |last2=Martin |first3=Maggie |last3=Haberman |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/28/us/politics/hillary-clintons-handling-of-email-issue-frustrates-democratic-leaders.html |title=Hillary Clinton's Handling of Email Issue Frustrates Democratic Leaders |newspaper=The New York Times |date=August 27, 2015 }}</ref> The ''Times'' reported, "None of the Democrats interviewed went so far as to suggest that the email issue raised concerns about Mrs. Clinton's ability to serve as president, and many expressed a belief that it had been [[manufactured controversy|manufactured]] by Republicans in Congress and other adversaries."<ref name="FrustratesDems"/> At the same time, many Democratic leaders showed increasing frustration among party leaders of Clinton's handling of the email issue. For example, [[Edward G. Rendell]], former [[governor of Pennsylvania]], a Clinton supporter, said that a failure of the Clinton campaign to get ahead of the issue early on meant that the campaign was "left just playing defense."<ref name="FrustratesDems"/> Other prominent Democrats, such as Governor [[Dannel P. Malloy]] of [[Connecticut]], were less concerned, noting the campaign was at an early stage and that attacks on Clinton were to be expected.<ref name="FrustratesDems"/>

At the October 2015 primary debate, Clinton's chief rival for the Democratic presidential nomination, Senator [[Bernie Sanders]] of [[Vermont]], defended Clinton, saying: "Let me say this. Let me say something that may not be great politics. But I think the secretary is right.

===Republican response===
[[Chairman of the Republican National Committee|Republican National Committee chairman]] [[Reince Priebus]] said, in a statement regarding the June 30, 2015 email releases, "These emails ... are just the tip of the iceberg, and we will never get full disclosure until Hillary Clinton releases her secret server for an independent investigation."<ref name=LATimes2/> [[Trey Gowdy]] said on June 29, 2015, that he would press the State Department for a fuller accounting of Clinton's emails, after the Benghazi panel retrieved 15 additional emails to Sidney Blumenthal that the department had not provided to the Committee.<ref name=Memoli1>{{cite news |last=Memoli |first=Michael A. |url=https://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-hillary-clinton-state-emails-20150629-story.html |title=Next batch of Hillary Clinton's emails will be released |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=June 30, 2015 }}</ref>

On September 12, 2015, Republican Senators [[Charles Grassley]] and [[Ron Johnson (Wisconsin politician)|Ron Johnson]], chairmen of the Senate [[Senate Judiciary Committee|Judiciary]] and [[Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee|Homeland Security]] committees, respectively, said they would seek an independent review of the deleted emails, if they were recovered from Clinton's server, to determine if there were any government related items among those deleted.<ref name=WP0912/>

===Comparisons and media coverage===
Analyses by Columbia Journalism Review, the [[Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society|Berkman Klein Center]] for Internet and Society at Harvard University, and the [[Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy|Shorenstein Center]] at the Harvard Kennedy School show that the Clinton email controversy received more coverage in mainstream media outlets than any other topic during the 2016 presidential election.<ref name=":4" /><ref name=":5" /><ref name=":6" /> The ''New York Times'' coverage of the email controversy was notoriously extensive; according to a Columbia Journalism Review analysis, "''in just six days, ''The New York Times'' ran as many cover stories about Hillary Clinton's emails as they did about all policy issues combined in the 69 days leading up to the election'' (and that does not include the three additional articles on October 18, and November 6 and 7, or the two articles on the emails taken from John Podesta)."<ref name=":4" /> In attempting to explain the lopsided coverage, the Columbia Journalism Review speculates, "In retrospect, it seems clear that the press in general made the mistake of assuming a Clinton victory was inevitable, and were setting themselves as credible critics of the next administration."<ref name=":4" />

[[Pundit|Media commentators]] drew comparisons of Clinton's email usage to past political controversies. ''Pacific Standard Magazine'' published an article in May 2015, comparing email controversy and her response to it with the [[Whitewater controversy|Whitewater]] investigation 20 years earlier.<ref name="PS031615">{{cite news|last1=Gerth|first1=Jeff|title=Hillary Clinton's Email Scandal Looks a Lot Like the Whitewater Investigation of 20 Years Ago|url=https://psmag.com/news/hillary-clintons-email-scandal-looks-a-lot-like-the-whitewater-investigation-of-20-years-ago|access-date=October 13, 2015|work=Pacific Standard|date=March 16, 2015}}</ref>

In August 2015, ''Washington Post'' associate editor and [[investigative journalist]] [[Bob Woodward]], when asked about Clinton's handling of her emails, said they remind him of the [[Nixon White House tapes|Nixon tapes]] from the [[Watergate scandal]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/watch/security-questions-linger-in-clinton-emails-508380739552 |title=Security questions linger in Clinton emails |work=[[Morning Joe]] |date=August 19, 2015 }}</ref> On March 9, 2015, liberal columnist and Clinton supporter [[Dana Milbank]] wrote that the email affair was "a needless, self-inflicted wound" brought about by "debilitating caution" in "trying to make sure an embarrassing e-mail or two didn't become public," which led to "obsessive secrecy." Milbank pointed out that Clinton herself had justifiably criticized the George W.

On ''[[Fox News Sunday]]'', [[political analyst]] [[Juan Williams]] contrasted the [[media coverage]] of Clinton's emails to the coverage of the 2007 [[Bush White House email controversy]] which he claimed received "just about zero press coverage."<ref name=":7">{{cite web|url=https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2015/mar/15/juan-williams/media-reaction-george-w-bushs-email-controversy/ |title=The media reaction to George W.

The ''[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]]'' published an editorial opining that "the only believable reason for the private server in her basement was to keep her emails out of the public eye by willfully avoiding freedom of information laws.

On June 22, 2015, the Benghazi panel released emails between Clinton and [[Sidney Blumenthal]], who had been recently deposed by the committee.

[[Judicial Watch]], a conservative activist group, filed a complaint against the Department of State in the [[United States District Court for the District of Columbia|U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia]] on September 10, 2013, seeking records under the [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|federal Freedom of Information Act]] relating to Clinton aide [[Huma Abedin]] (a former deputy chief of staff and former senior advisor at the State Department).<ref name="JW March 12, 2015">{{cite press release |work=Judicial Watch |url=https://www.judicialwatch.org/press-releases/citing-misconduct-and-misrepresentation-by-hillary-clinton-and-state-department-judicial-watch-asks-federal-court-to-reopen-lawsuit-seeking-information-on-top-clinton-aide-huma-abedin/ |title=Citing Misconduct and Misrepresentation by Hillary Clinton and State Department, Judicial Watch Asks Federal Court to Reopen Lawsuit Seeking Information on Top Clinton Aide Huma Abedin |date=March 12, 2015 }}</ref><ref name="JW September 2013 Complaint">{{cite web |work=Judicial Watch |url=https://www.judicialwatch.org/documents/huma-employment/ |title=Huma Outside Employment Complaint |date=September 10, 2013 }}</ref> Judicial Watch was particularly interested in Abedin's role as a "special government employee" (SGE), a consulting position which allowed her to represent outside clients while also serving at the State Department.

===''Associated Press v. U.S. Department of State''===
On March 11, 2015, the day after Clinton acknowledged her private email account, the Associated Press (AP) filed suit against the State Department regarding multiple FOIA requests over the past five years. The requests were for various emails and other documents from Clinton's time as secretary of state and were still unfulfilled at the time.<ref name="APSuitFiled">{{cite news |agency=Associated Press |url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/associated-press-sues-state-department-for-hillary-clinton-emails/ |title=Associated Press sues State Department for Hillary Clinton emails |work=CBS News |date=March 11, 2015 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://cryptome.org/2015/03/ap-001.pdf |title=Complaint |work=Associated Press v.

On July 20, 2015, U.S. District Judge [[Richard J.

===Other suits and coordination of email cases===
In September 2015, the State Department filed a motion in court seeking to consolidate and coordinate the large number of Freedom of Information Act lawsuits relating to Clinton and Clinton-related emails. There were at the time at least three dozen lawsuits pending, before 17 different judges.<ref>{{cite news |first=Josh |last=Gerstein |url=https://www.politico.com/blogs/under-the-radar/2015/09/feds-move-to-consolidate-lawsuits-over-hillary-clinton-emails-213228 |title=Feds move to consolidate lawsuits over Hillary Clinton emails |work=[[Politico]] |date=September 1, 2015 }}</ref><ref name="TauCoordination">{{cite news |last=Tau |first=Byron |url=https://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2015/10/08/court-declines-to-consolidate-clinton-emails-lawsuits/ |title=Court Declines to Consolidate Clinton Emails Lawsuits |newspaper=The Wall Street Journal |date=October 8, 2015 }}</ref>

In a [[United States District Court for the District of Columbia|U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia]] order issued on October 8, 2015, Chief U.S. District Judge [[Richard W. Roberts]] wrote that the cases did not meet the usual criteria for consolidation but: "The judges who have been randomly assigned to these cases have been and continue to be committed to informal coordination so as to avoid unnecessary inefficiencies and confusion, and the parties are also urged to meet and confer to assist in coordination."<ref name="TauCoordination"/>

In 2015, Judicial Watch and the Cause of Action Institute filed two lawsuits seeking a court order to compel the Department of State and the [[National Archives and Records Administration]] to recover emails from Clinton's server. In January 2016, these two suits (which were consolidated because they involved the same issues) were dismissed as [[Mootness|moot]] by U.S. District Judge [[James Boasberg]], because the government was already working to recover and preserve these emails.<ref>{{cite news |url-status=live |url=https://apnews.com/b219d2da39454b799b653187d6ab2831/judge-dismisses-pair-lawsuits-arising-clinton-emails |title=Judge dismisses pair of lawsuits arising from Clinton emails |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160404032537/http://bigstory.ap.org/article/b219d2da39454b799b653187d6ab2831/judge-dismisses-pair-lawsuits-arising-clinton-emails |archive-date=April 4, 2016 |work=Associated Press |date=January 11, 2016 }}</ref>

In March 2016, the [[Republican National Committee]] filed four new [[complaint (law)|complaints]] in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia stemming from Freedom of Information Act requests it had filed the previous year. These new filings brought the total number of civil suits over access to Clinton's records pending in federal court to at least 38.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/news/politics/articles/2016-03-15/gop-files-more-lawsuits-seeking-hillary-clinton-records|title=GOP files a flurry of new lawsuits seeking reams of government documents related to Clinton's tenure as secretary of state|date=March 15, 2016|work=[[U.S. News and World Report]]|first1=Michael|last1=Biesecker|agency=[[Associated Press]]|access-date=September 16, 2016}}</ref>
