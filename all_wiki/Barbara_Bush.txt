'''Barbara Bush''' ({{nee|'''Pierce'''}}; June 8, 1925&nbsp;– April 17, 2018) was the [[First Lady of the United States|first lady of the United States]] from 1989 to 1993 as the wife of [[George H. W. Bush]], who served as the [[List of Presidents of the United States|41st]] [[president of the United States]], and founder of the [[Barbara Bush Foundation for Family Literacy]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Barbara Pierce Bush |url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/about-the-white-house/first-ladies/barbara-pierce-bush/ |website=The White House}}</ref> She previously was the [[Second Lady of the United States|second lady of the United States]] from 1981 to 1989. Among her six children are [[George W. Bush]], the 43rd president of the United States, and [[Jeb Bush]], the 43rd [[List of Governors of Florida|governor of Florida]]. She and [[Abigail Adams]] are the only two women to be the wife of one U.S. president and the mother of another.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.politico.com/story/2018/04/17/barbara-bush-george-obituary-first-lady-221779 | title=Barbara Bush, matriarch of Bush dynasty, dies at 92 | publisher=[[Politico]] | work=David Cohen | date=April 17, 2018 | accessdate=November 27, 2019}}</ref>

Barbara Pierce was born in [[NewYork–Presbyterian Queens|Booth Memorial Hospital]] in New York City. She met George Herbert Walker Bush at the age of sixteen, and the two married in [[Rye, New York]] in 1945, while he was on leave during his deployment as a Naval officer in [[World War II]]. They moved to [[Texas]] in 1948, where George later began his political career.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/24/washington/24immig.html|title= Texas Town, Now Divided, Forged Bush's Stand on Immigration|work=New York Times|date=June 24, 2007|accessdate= October 22, 2018}}</ref>

==Early life==
Barbara Pierce was born on June 8, 1925, at [[Booth Memorial Hospital]] (which at that time was located at 314 East 15th Street in [[Manhattan]]) in New York City,<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FSpcDwAAQBAJ&q=BARBARA+BUSH+BOOTH+MEMORIAL+HOSPITAL&pg=PT50|title=The Matriarch: Barbara Bush and the Making of an American Dynasty|isbn=9781538713655|last1=Page|first1=Susan|date=April 2, 2019}}</ref> to Pauline (née Robinson) and [[Marvin Pierce]]. She was raised in the suburban town of [[Rye, New York]].<ref name="FL bio">{{cite web |url=http://www.firstladies.org/biographies/firstladies.aspx?biography=42 |title=First Lady Biography: Barbara Bush |publisher=[[First Ladies National Historic Site|National First Ladies Library]] |access-date=January 21, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090303162751/http://www.firstladies.org/biographies/firstladies.aspx?biography=42 |archivedate=March 3, 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Her father later became president of McCall Corporation, the publisher of the popular women's magazines ''[[Redbook]]'' and ''[[McCall's]]''. She had two elder siblings, Martha (1920–1999) and James (1922-1993), and a younger brother, Scott (b. 1930). Her ancestor Thomas Pierce Jr., an early [[New England]] colonist, was also an ancestor of [[Franklin Pierce]], 14th president of the United States. She was a fourth cousin, four times removed, of Franklin Pierce and [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]].<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.famouskin.com/famous-kin-menu.php?name=3102+barbara+bush|title= Famous Kin of Barbara (Pierce) Bush |publisher=FamousKin.com}}</ref>

Pierce and her three siblings were raised in a house on Onondaga Street in Rye. She attended Milton Public School from 1931 to 1937, [[Rye Country Day School]] until 1940<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.lohud.com/story/news/2018/04/17/barbara-bush-dies/526629002/ |title=Barbara Bush dies at age 92, grew up in Rye |publisher=Lohud.com |agency=Associated Press |date=April 18, 2018 |accessdate=April 18, 2018}}</ref> and later the boarding school [[Ashley Hall (Charleston, South Carolina)|Ashley Hall]] in [[Charleston, South Carolina]], from 1940 to 1943.<ref name="FL bio" /> In her youth, Pierce was athletic and enjoyed swimming, tennis, and bike riding.<ref name="FL bio" /> Her interest in reading began early in life; she recalled gathering and reading with her family during the evenings.<ref name="FL bio" />

==Marriage and family==
[[File:Entire Bush family.jpg|thumb|Barbara Bush, center, surrounded by her family, mid 1960s]]

When Pierce was 16 and on Christmas vacation, she met [[George H. W. Bush]] (1924-2018) at a dance at the Round Hill Country Club in [[Greenwich, Connecticut]];<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.cnn.com/2012/12/26/us/barbara-bush---fast-facts/index.html |title=Barbara Bush Fast Facts |publisher=CNN |date=April 17, 2018 |accessdate=April 18, 2018}}</ref> he was a student at [[Phillips Academy]] in [[Andover, Massachusetts]].<ref>Bush, Barbara (1994), p. 16</ref> After 18 months, the two became engaged to be married, just before he went off to [[World War II]] as a [[United States Navy|Navy]] torpedo bomber pilot. He named three of his planes after her: ''Barbara,'' ''Barbara II'', and ''Barbara III''. When he returned on leave, she had discontinued her studies at [[Smith College]] in [[Northampton, Massachusetts]];<ref name="FL bio" /> two weeks later, on January 6, 1945, they were married at the First Presbyterian Church in Rye, New York,<ref name="FL bio" /> with the reception being held at [[The Apawamis Club]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.lohud.com/story/opinion/editorials/2018/04/17/remembering-barbara-bush-rye/526731002/ |title=Barbara Bush, former First Lady, fondly remembered her Rye hometown |publisher=Lohud.com |date= |accessdate=April 18, 2018}}</ref> They were married 73 years until her death on April 17, 2018, the longest-married presidential couple in U.S. history until Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter beat their record on October 17, 2019.

For the first eight months of their marriage, the Bushes moved around the Eastern United States, to places including [[Michigan]], [[Maryland]], and [[Virginia]], where George Bush's Navy squadron training required his presence.<ref name="FL bio" />

Over the next 13 years, George and Barbara Bush had six children who, among them, gave the couple a total of 17 grandchildren and 9 great-grandchildren:

*[[George W. Bush|George Walker Bush]] (b. 1946), who married [[Laura Bush|Laura Welch]] on November 5, 1977. They have twin daughters, and three grandchildren.
*[[Pauline Robinson Bush|Pauline Robinson "Robin" Bush]] (1949–1953), who died of [[leukemia]] at age 3.
*[[Jeb Bush|John Ellis "Jeb" Bush Sr.]] (b. 1953), who married [[Columba Bush|Columba Garnica Gallo]] on February 23, 1974. They have three children, and four grandchildren.
*[[Neil Bush|Neil Mallon Bush]] (b. 1955), who married Sharon Smith in 1980; they divorced in April 2003. They have three children, and two grandsons. Neil married Maria Andrews in 2004.
*[[Marvin Bush|Marvin Pierce Bush]] (b. 1956), who married Margaret Molster in 1981. They have two children. 
*[[Dorothy Bush Koch|Dorothy Walker "Doro" Bush Koch]] (b. 1959), who married William LeBlond in 1982; they divorced in 1990, and have two children. Dorothy married [[Bobby Koch|Robert P. Koch]] in June 1992; they have two children.

==Texas years==
After the war ended, George and Barbara had their first child while George was a student at [[Yale University]]. Famously, the child's very first words were "How's Barbara?" - a phrase she had heard echo from her father daily on his return from work. The young family soon moved to [[Odessa, Texas]], where George entered the oil business. In September 1949, Barbara's parents were in a car accident in New York and her mother was killed. Mrs. Bush was pregnant at the time with her second child, and was advised not to travel to attend the funeral.  When the baby was born, she was named Pauline Robinson Bush in honor of Barbara's mother.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.biography.com/people/barbara-bush-9232727|title=Barbara Bush|website=The Biography.com Website|accessdate=April 19, 2018}}</ref> The Bushes moved to the Los Angeles area for a time, and then to [[Midland, Texas]] in 1950. The Bushes would move some 29 times during their marriage.<ref name="FL bio" /> Over time, Bush built a business in the oil industry and joined with colleagues to start up the successful [[HRG Group|Zapata Corporation]]. Barbara raised her children while her husband was usually away on business. In 1953, the Bushes' daughter, Robin, died of [[leukemia]].<ref name="FL bio" />

When their daughter Dorothy was born in August 1959, the Bushes moved from Midland to Houston. In 1963, George Bush was elected [[Harris County, Texas|Harris County]] Republican Party chairman, in the first of what would become many elections. In 1964, he made his first run for a prominent political office—[[United States Senate|U.S. senator]] from Texas. Although he lost the election, the exposure that the Bush family received put George and Barbara on the national scene.<ref name="FL bio" />

==Political life==
In 1966, George Bush was elected as a [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. representative]] in Congress from Texas. Barbara raised her children while her husband campaigned and occasionally joined him on the trail. Over the ensuing years, George Bush was elected or appointed to several different positions in the U.S. Congress or the executive branch, or government-related posts, and Barbara Bush accompanied him in each case.

[[File:George and Barbara Bush in Houston, Texas on the night which George Bush was elected to Congress - NARA - 186373.tif|right|thumb|The Bushes celebrate in Houston on the evening in 1966 that George was elected a congressman.]]

As the wife of a congressman, Barbara immersed herself in projects that piqued her interest; the projects included various charities and Republican women's groups in Washington, D.C.<ref name="FL bio" /> Though her husband lost a second bid for the Senate in 1970, President [[Richard Nixon]] appointed him the [[United States Ambassador to the United Nations|United States ambassador to the United Nations]], which enabled Barbara to begin forming relationships in [[New York City]] with prominent diplomats.<ref name="FL bio" /> As the [[Watergate scandal]] heated up in 1973, Nixon asked Bush to become Chairman of the [[Republican National Committee]]; Barbara advised her husband to reject the offer because of the harsh political climate,<ref name="FL bio" /> but he accepted anyway.

Nixon's successor, [[Gerald Ford]], appointed Bush [[United States Ambassador to China|head of the U.S. Liaison Office]] in the [[People's Republic of China]] in 1974, and the Bushes relocated. She enjoyed the time that she spent in China and often rode bicycles with her husband to explore cities and regions that few Americans had visited.<ref name="FL bio" /> Three years later, Bush was recalled to the U.S. to serve as [[Director of Central Intelligence]] during a crucial time of legal uncertainty for the agency. He was not allowed to share classified aspects of his job with Barbara; the ensuing sense of isolation, coupled with her perception that she was not achieving her goals while other women of her time were, plunged her into a depression.<ref name="FL bio" /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://articles.philly.com/1990-05-22/news/25886573_1_barbara-bush-doggie-bag-volunteer-work |first=W. |last=Speers |title=Barbara Bush: I Overcame Depression |publisher=[[Philadelphia Media Network]] |date=May 22, 1990 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090303162751/http://articles.philly.com/1990-05-22/news/25886573_1_barbara-bush-doggie-bag-volunteer-work |archivedate=March 3, 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref> She did not seek professional help. Instead, she began delivering speeches and presentations about her time spent in the closed-off China, and volunteered at a [[hospice]].<ref name="FL bio" />

Barbara Bush defended her husband's experience and personal qualities when he announced his candidacy for President of the United States in 1980. She caused a stir when she said that she supported ratification of the [[Equal Rights Amendment]] and was [[pro-choice]] on abortion,<ref name="FL bio" /> placing her at odds with the conservative wing of the Republican party, led by California governor [[Ronald Reagan]]. Reagan earned the presidential nomination over her husband, who then accepted Reagan's invitation to be his running mate; the team was elected in 1980.

===Second Lady of the United States===

Barbara Bush's eight years as [[Wife of the Vice President of the United States|second lady]] made her a household name. 
After her son Neil was diagnosed with [[dyslexia]], she took an interest in literacy issues and began working with several different literacy organizations. She spent much time researching and learning about the factors that contributed to illiteracy—she believed [[homelessness]] was also connected<ref name="bio">{{cite web |title=Barbara Bush Biography |access-date=December 23, 2011 |publisher=[[A&E Television Networks]], LLC |url=http://www.biography.com/people/barbara-bush-9232727 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004022352/http://www.biography.com/people/barbara-bush-9232727 |archivedate=October 4, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>—and the efforts underway to combat both.<ref name="FL bio" /> She traveled around the country and the world, either with the vice president on official trips or by herself. In 1984, she wrote a children's book, ''[[C. Fred's Story]]'', which recounted the adventures of a family as related by their cocker spaniel, C. Fred. She donated all of the book's proceeds to literacy charities.<ref name="bio" />

By the mid-1980s, Bush was comfortable speaking in front of groups, and she routinely spoke to promote issues in which she believed. She became famous for expressing a sense of humor and self-deprecating wit.<ref name="FL bio" /> During the 1984 presidential campaign, Barbara made headlines when she told the press that she could not say on television what she thought of vice presidential candidate [[Geraldine Ferraro]], but "it rhymes with rich".<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20081015182134/http://www.bartleby.com/63/95/595.html Simpson's Contemporary Quotations, compiled by James B.

In 1988, Vice President Bush announced his candidacy for president to succeed the term-limited President Reagan. By this time, Barbara had experienced two presidential campaigns, but broke new ground by becoming the third candidate's spouse to speak at the national party convention that nominated her husband (after Eleanor Roosevelt in 1940 and Pat Nixon in 1972).<ref name="FL bio" /> She promised voters that she would be a traditional first lady and campaigned actively for her husband.<ref name="bio" /> The campaign at times focused on the large Bush family, and contrasted her with the incumbent first lady, [[Nancy Reagan]], by highlighting her interest in domestic staples such as church, gardening, and time spent with family while placing less emphasis on style sense and fashion; she drew attention to both her famous white hair and disinterest in wearing designer clothes.<ref name="FL bio" /> She generally avoided discussion of political issues during the campaign, particularly those on which she and her husband differed, and those closely involved with the campaign have reported that she was actively involved in campaign strategy.<ref name="FL bio" /> Bush was elected in November 1988 and sworn in on January 20, 1989.

During the early 1980s, after statistics had shown that foreign-born immigrants from Latin America had nearly quintupled just since 1960, statistics showed that 35 million adults could not read above the eighth-grade level and that 23 million were not able to read beyond a fourth-grade level. Mrs. Bush appeared on ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'' to discuss the situation and spoke regularly on ''Mrs. Bush's Story Time'', a national radio program that stressed the importance of reading aloud to children.<ref name="FL bio" /> Her children Jeb Bush and Dorothy Bush Koch serve as co-chairs of the Barbara Bush Foundation for Family Literacy.

She was active in the [[White House Historical Association]] and worked to revitalize the White House Preservation Fund, which she renamed the [[White House Endowment Trust]]. The trust raises funds for the ongoing refurbishment and restoration of the [[White House]]. She met her goal of raising $25 million towards the endowment. The White House residence staff generally found Barbara Bush to be the friendliest and most easygoing of the First Ladies with whom they had dealt.<ref>Brower, Kate Andersen (2015), pp. 46, 75, 117–122, 136</ref>

Barbara Bush became the first U.S. first lady to become a recipient of the [[Henry G. Freeman Jr. Pin Money Fund]], receiving $36,000, most of which she gave to favorite charities.

=== Personal life and interests ===
Bush was known for her affection for her pet [[English Springer Spaniel]] [[Millie (dog)|Millie]] and wrote a [[Millie's Book|children's book about Millie's new litter of puppies]]. She even included Millie in her official White House portrait, painted by [[Candace Whittemore Lovely]].<ref>"Arts & Scholars". The Trident (Winter 2013): 19.</ref>

She was struck every day by "how much things had changed" for her and her husband since they became president and first lady. In place of a limousine, Bush tried to use a smaller car and travel by train and commercial aircraft for out-of-town trips. The heads of Bush's Secret Service detail were partially opposed to her wishes; the agents agreed to the small car but did not approve of the commercial air and train travel. At that time, the number of threats to the first lady was higher than that of the vice president. Bush still wanted to use public transportation despite the opposition of the Secret Service. She was put-off by the fact that her flights would be delayed while agents checked out the planes and luggage. The plane on which Bush traveled was nicknamed "Bright Star", in honor of the leukemia foundation her husband and [[Hugh Liedtke]] founded after her daughter Robin died.<ref>Bush, Barbara (1994), pp. 264–265.</ref>

She gave the [[Wellesley College]] commencement address in 1990; her speech was listed as #45 in American Rhetoric's Top 100 Speeches of the 20th Century (listed by rank).<ref name="americanrhetoric1">{{cite web|first=Michael E.|last=Eidenmuller |url=https://www.americanrhetoric.com/top100speechesall.html |title=Top 100 Speeches of the 20th Century by Rank |publisher=American Rhetoric |date=February 13, 2009 |access-date=October 27, 2015}}</ref>

During her husband's 1992 presidential campaign, Barbara Bush stated that [[abortion]] and [[homosexuality]] are personal matters and argued that the Republican Party should not take a stand on them, saying that "The personal things should be left out of, in my opinion, platforms and conventions." Her personal views on abortion were not known, although her friends reported at that time that she "privately supported [[abortion rights]]".<ref>{{cite news|first=John M.|last=Broder|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19920814&slug=1507390|title=Barbara Bush Calls Abortion 'Personal Choice'|publisher=Seattle Times|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=August 14, 1992|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090303162751/http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19920814&slug=1507390|archivedate=March 3, 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref> She explained, "I hate abortions, but I just could not make that choice for someone else."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/us-politics/8118079/George-W-Bush-became-opposed-to-abortion-when-mother-showed-him-dead-foetus-in-jar.html|location=London|work=The Daily Telegraph|first=Toby|last=Harnden|authorlink=Toby Harnden|title=George W Bush became opposed to abortion when mother showed him dead foetus in jar|date=November 8, 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090303162751/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/us-politics/8118079/George-W-Bush-became-opposed-to-abortion-when-mother-showed-him-dead-foetus-in-jar.html|archivedate=March 3, 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Post–White House years===
Bush's husband ultimately went on to lose his bid for re-election to [[Bill Clinton]]. After leaving the White House, the couple resided at the [[River Oaks, Houston|River Oaks community in Houston, Texas]], and at the [[Bush compound]] in [[Kennebunkport, Maine]]. Bush described January 20, 1993, the day of [[Bill Clinton]]'s inauguration, a "tough day" for her and her husband. After returning to Houston, the two were visited by their son, George W. Bush, and at that point, Bush realized that she had not cooked in 12 years. She had difficulty driving a car on her own, and she did not drive far from home for a long time; her husband warned people to get out of the way if they saw her car.<ref>Bush, Barbara (2004), pp. 5–7.</ref> A month after her husband left office in February 1993, Bush was surprised when her husband booked them on the "Love Boat" ship ''[[Pacific Dawn (ship)|Regal Princess]]''.<ref>Bush, Barbara (2004), p. 9.</ref> In April 1993, Bush and her husband had breakfast with the former British Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]], who was on an American speaking tour. Thatcher mentioned the most recent celebration of former President [[Ronald Reagan]]'s birthday at the [[Ronald Reagan Presidential Library]] and Museum, where he orated the same card twice. Bush read about the incident after Reagan was diagnosed with [[Alzheimer's disease]], which she called a "tragedy for both" the Reagans.<ref>Bush, Barbara (2004), p. 16.</ref>
[[File:US Navy 050318-O-4039N-002 President George W. Bush and his mother, Barbara Bush, wave goodbye to a crowd of over 200 Sailors and Marines aboard Naval Air Station (NAS) Pensacola, Fla.jpg|thumb|right|President George W. Bush and his mother Barbara prepare to board [[Air Force One]], 2005]]

Bush attempted to persuade her son George W. Bush not to run for [[Governor of Texas]] in the 1994 gubernatorial election. She was convinced that he could not defeat [[Ann Richards]], but he went on to win the election.<ref>Natfali, p. 159.</ref> Several days after he was sworn in as Governor of Texas, she went to a Distinguished Speakers Event at the [[Lyndon Baines Johnson Library and Museum|LBJ Library]] for [[Lady Bird Johnson]]. There, she was introduced by her son, the new Governor of Texas, and the following day, received a letter from him dated January 18, 1995, in which he asserted that he would not be governor had it not been for her and [[George H. W. Bush]]. Mrs. Bush described the letter as having "moved" both her and her husband.<ref>Bush, Barbara. (2004), p. 72.</ref><ref>Bush, Barbara (2004), p. 79.</ref> On September 3, 1995, the Bushes went to [[Vietnam]]. This was "unbelievable" to Barbara because she "never expected to set foot in what had been [[North Vietnam]]. The Bushes first went to [[Hanoi]] and then to [[Ho Chi Minh City]]. They met with President [[Lê Đức Anh]] and party secretary [[Đỗ Mười]].<ref>Bush, Barbara (2004), pp. 85–86.</ref> On September 28, 1995, the Bushes drove to [[Portland, Maine]], for the announcement of the Barbara Bush Children's Hospital. Bush said her life was being stretched, adding, "Long after I am gone this hospital will be there with my name." The Bushes visited the children there, and Mrs. Bush started to recall her daughter Robin after seeing them. The Bushes returned home early that month.<ref>Bush, Barbara (2004), pp. 91–92.</ref>

Bush campaigned for her son George W. Bush after he announced his presidential campaign in June 1999. Throughout the country, she met with women who supported his campaign, but she remained doubtful of his chances of winning. The resentment toward the campaign continued with her rejection of any criticism of her son that was said in her presence. She refused to watch any of the debates, in contrast to her husband, who was willing to listen and watch every debate. This created friction between the couple.<ref>{{cite book|title=George H. W.

Several schools have been named for her: three [[primary school]]s and two [[middle school]]s in Texas and an elementary school in [[Mesa, Arizona]]. Also named for her is the Barbara Bush Library in [[Harris County, Texas]],<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20090101115329/http://www.hcpl.lib.tx.us/branchinfo/cc/ccinfo.htm Barbara Bush Branch Library @ Cypress Creek]. hcpl.lib.tx.us</ref> and the Barbara Bush Children's Hospital at [[Maine Medical Center]] in [[Portland, Maine]]. She served on the Boards of AmeriCares and the [[Mayo Clinic]], and headed the Barbara Bush Foundation for Family Literacy.

On March 18, 2003—two days before the beginning of the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]]—her son [[George W. Bush]] was President when [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[Good Morning America]]'' asked her about her family's television viewing habits. She replied:
{{quote|
I watch none. He [former President George H. W. Bush] sits and listens and I read books, because I know perfectly well that, don't take offense, that 90 percent of what I hear on television is supposition, when we're talking about the news. And he's not, not as understanding of my pettiness about that. But why should we hear about body bags and deaths, and how many, what day it's gonna happen, and how many this or that or what do you suppose? Or, I mean, it's not relevant. So, why should I waste my beautiful mind on something like that, and watch him suffer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/politics/quotes/barbara.asp|title=Barbara Bush 'Beautiful Mind' Quote|publisher=Snopes|access-date=November 17, 2011}}</ref>}}

Almost everyone I've talked to says, 'We're gonna move to Houston.' What I'm hearing, which is sort of scary, is they all want to stay in Texas...
