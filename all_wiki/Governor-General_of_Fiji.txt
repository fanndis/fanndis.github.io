{{Politics of Fiji}}

Fiji became a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Colony of Fiji|Crown Colony]] in 1874, and an independent [[Dominion of Fiji|Dominion]] in the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] in 1970. [[Elizabeth II of Fiji|Queen Elizabeth II]] remained the [[Monarchy of Fiji|Head of State]], holding the title of ''[[Monarchy of Fiji|Queen of Fiji]]'' until 1987, when she formally abdicated following [[1987 Fijian coups d'état|two military coups]]. From 1874 to 1987 the Monarch's functions were exercised in Fiji by his or her representative, the [[Governor of Fiji|Governor]] (up to 1970), and, following independence, by the [[Governor-General]].

In 1987, the position of governor-general was replaced with a [[President of Fiji]].
