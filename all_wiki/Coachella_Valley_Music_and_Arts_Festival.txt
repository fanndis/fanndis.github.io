The '''Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival''' (commonly called '''Coachella''' or the '''Coachella Festival''') is an annual [[music festival|music]] and [[arts festival]] held at the [[Empire Polo Club]] in [[Indio, California]], in the [[Coachella Valley]] in the [[Colorado Desert]]. It was co-founded by Paul Tollett and Rick Van Santen in 1999, and is organized by [[Goldenvoice]], a subsidiary of [[Anschutz Entertainment Group|AEG Presents]].<ref name="santen-obit">{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2004/jan/03/local/me-vansanten3|title=Rick Van Santen, 41; L.A. Promoter Helped to Advance Punk Rock Bands|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|last=Cromelin|first=Richard|date=January 3, 2004|access-date=November 8, 2016|page=B18}}</ref> The event features musical artists from many [[Music genre|genres of music]], including [[rock music|rock]], [[pop music|pop]], [[Independent music|indie]], [[hip hop music|hip hop]] and [[electronic dance music]], as well as [[Installation art|art installations]] and [[sculpture]]s. Across the grounds, several stages continuously host live music.

The festival's origins trace back to a 1993 concert that [[Pearl Jam]] performed at the Empire Polo Club while boycotting venues controlled by [[Ticketmaster]]. The show validated the site's viability for hosting large events, leading to the inaugural Coachella Festival being held over the course of two days in October 1999, three months after [[Woodstock 1999|Woodstock '99]]. After no event was held in 2000, Coachella returned on an annual basis beginning in April 2001 as a single-day event. In 2002, the festival reverted to a two-day format. Coachella was expanded to a third day in 2007 and eventually a second weekend in 2012; it is now held on consecutive three-day weekends in April, with the same lineup each weekend. Organizers began permitting spectators to camp on the grounds in 2003, one of several expansions and additions in the festival's history.

Coachella showcases popular and established musical artists as well as emerging artists and reunited groups. It is one of the largest, most famous, and most profitable music festivals in the United States and the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/music/posts/la-et-ms-goldenvoice-releases-coachella-set-times-20140408,0,4834910.story|title=Goldenvoice releases Coachella set times, adds to the lineup|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|first=Todd|last=Martens|date=April 8, 2014|access-date=April 9, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://blog.tripoetic.com/7-top-music-festivals-around-the-world/|title=7 Top Music Festivals Around The World – Tripoetic Blog|date=January 31, 2017|newspaper=Tripoetic Blog|access-date=February 23, 2017}}</ref> Each Coachella staged from 2013 to 2015 set new records for festival attendance and gross revenues. The 2017 festival was attended by 250,000 people and grossed $114.6 million. Coachella's success led to Goldenvoice establishing additional music festivals at the site, including the annual [[Stagecoach Festival|Stagecoach]] [[country music]] festival beginning in 2007, the Big 4 [[thrash metal]] festival in 2011, and the classic rock-oriented [[Desert Trip]] in 2016.

Around 1997, Goldenvoice was struggling to book concerts against larger companies, and they were unable to offer guarantees as high as their competitors, such as [[SFX Entertainment]]. Tollett said, "We were getting our ass kicked financially. We were losing a lot of bands. And we couldn't compete with the money."<ref name=":0">{{cite magazine|title=Coachella Preserves Its Diverse Lineup of A-List Talent|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|first=Susanne|last=Ault|date=March 15, 2003|volume=115|issue=11|page=18}}</ref> As a result, the idea of a music festival was conceived, and Tollett began to brainstorm ideas for one with multiple venues. His intent was to book trendy artists who were not necessarily chart successes: "Maybe if you put a bunch of them together, that might be a magnet for a lot of people."<ref name="desertmagician"/> While attending the 1997 [[Glastonbury Festival]], Tollett handed out pamphlets to artists and talent managers that featured pictures of the Empire Polo Club and pitched a possible festival there. In contrast to the frequently muddy conditions at Glastonbury caused by rain, he recalled, "We had this pamphlet... showing sunny Coachella. Everyone was laughing."<ref name="mastermind"/>

After scouting several sites for their festival,<ref name=tollett/> Tollett and Goldenvoice co-president Rick Van Santen returned to the Empire Polo Club during the Big Gig festival in 1998. Impressed by the location's suitability for a festival, they decided to book their event there.<ref name="desertmagician"/> The promoters had hoped to stage their inaugural festival in 1998 but were unable to until the following year.<ref name="mastermind"/> On July 16, 1999, Goldenvoice announced that the Indio City Council had approved the festival and would provide $90,000 for services such as traffic control and public safety. The funds came with a guarantee of repayment from the promoter, as the city was keen to avoid incurring another loss; the previous year's Big Gig festival cost Indio $16,000 due to last-minute changes to the lineup and poor attendance.<ref>{{cite news|title=Alternative music gig slate for Indio in fall|newspaper=[[The Desert Sun]]|first=Mark|last=Armstrong|date=July 17, 1999|page=A1, A8}}</ref> The Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival was officially announced on July 28 with a preliminary lineup of 40 acts;<ref>{{cite news|title=Alternative music fest will arrive in Indio|newspaper=[[The Desert Sun]]|first=Mark|last=Armstrong|date=July 28, 1999|page=B1–2}}</ref> tickets went on sale on August 7.<ref>{{cite news|title=Post-Festival Stage Fright|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|first=Geoff|last=Boucher|date=August 7, 1999|pages=F1, F20|edition=Valley}}</ref>

Coachella's announcement came just one week after the conclusion of [[Woodstock '99]], a festival in July 1999 that was marred by looting, arson, violence, and rapes. Goldenvoice's insurance costs increased 40% as a result and the company faced uncertainty regarding Coachella's tickets.<ref name="mastermind"/><ref name="willtheycome">{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1999/oct/07/entertainment/ca-19554|title=If You Build It, Will They Come?|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|first=Geoff|last=Boucher|date=October 7, 1999|access-date=June 2, 2015|at=sec.

The 2006 event featured headliners [[Depeche Mode]] and Tool.

In 2007, Goldenvoice inaugurated the [[Stagecoach Festival]], an annual [[country music]] festival that also takes place at the Empire Polo Club the weekend following Coachella.

These services for the three weekends of festivals totaled $2.77 million in 2012.<ref name="indio-gv">{{cite news|url=http://www.desertsun.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=2013304180060|title=Making a Music Mecca|newspaper=[[The Desert Sun]]|first=Xochitl|last=Peña|date=April 19, 2013|access-date=May 1, 2019|pages=A1, A12|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6G38alBLI?url=http://www.mydesert.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=2013304180060&nclick_check=1|archivedate=April 21, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> All public safety needs are coordinated by Indio's police department, requiring them to liaise with nearly 12 agencies, including police departments from nearby cities, the [[sheriff]]'s department, [[California Highway Patrol]], the [[California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection]], [[American Medical Response]], and the [[California Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control]].<ref name="indio-gv"/> To avoid disturbing local residents, a [[curfew]] for music performances is enforced; since 2010, it has been 1 a.m. on Fridays and Saturdays, an hour later than the previous curfew,<ref name="indio-gv"/> and midnight on Sundays.<ref name="tollettspills"/> Goldenvoice must pay a fine of $1,000 for each minute the festival exceeds the curfew.<ref name="tollettspills"/>

===Environmental sustainability===
[[File:TRASHed Coachella 2013 GI.jpg|thumb|right|Coachella features [[Global Inheritance]]'s TRASHed :: Art of Recycling campaign, in which artists from across the US design recycling bins.]]
Organizers of Coachella manage its [[carbon footprint]] by partnering with the organization [[Global Inheritance]] to promote several environmentally friendly initiatives. Global Inheritance's original project was its "TRASHed :: Art of Recycling" campaign, which challenges local artists to design and decorate recycling bins that are placed across the festival grounds.<ref name="sustaingame">{{cite web|url=http://www.desertsun.com/story/life/entertainment/music/coachella/2015/04/19/recycling-bins-sustainability-polar-bear-coachella/26022817/|title=Sustainability becomes a game for Coachella festivalgoers|work=[[The Desert Sun]]|first=Rosalie|last=Murphy|date=April 19, 2015|access-date=April 23, 2015}}</ref> Another program is "Carpoolchella"; launched in 2007,<ref name="sustaingame"/> it rewards festivalgoers who [[carpool]] in groups of four or more and display the word "Carpoolchella" on their cars by entering them in a drawing to win VIP tickets for life.<ref>{{cite book|title=Sustainable Event Management: A Practical Guide|first=Meegan|last=Jones|year=2014|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=978-0-415-84019-4|page=146}}</ref> Through the 2014 festival, the program had 140,000 participants and more than 70 winners of lifetime festival passes.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Carpoolchella|magazine=Camp|publisher=Urb Magazine|first=Jack|last=Real|date=April 2015|issue=6|page=2}}</ref> In 2007, Coachella teamed up with Global Inheritance to start a 10-for-1 recycling program, in which anyone who collects ten empty water bottles receives a free full one.

About 600 staffers are required to collect the litter that accumulates during the festival. Resources are sorted individually on site before being taken to local landfills and recycling centers. Goldenvoice maintains a goal to "divert 90 percent of [its] recyclable and compostable materials". In 2013, staff diverted over 577,720,000 pounds of materials, comprising 36,860 tons of aluminum cans, 105,000 tons of cardboard, 65,360 tons of PET plastic, 47,040 tons of scrap metal, and 34,600 tons of glass.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=The Pick-Up Artists|magazine=Camp|publisher=Urb Magazine|first=Leslie|last=Madill|date=April 2014|issue=5|page=8}}</ref>

===Camping===
In 2003, Coachella began allowing tent camping as an option for festival lodging. The campground site is on a polo field adjacent to the venue grounds and has its own entrance on the south side of the venue. 2010 introduced many new features, such as re-entry from the campsite to the festival grounds, parking next to your tent, and [[recreational vehicle]] camping spots ([[recreational vehicle]] camping was offered one year only). For that festival, there were more than 17,000 campers. At the 2012 event, on-site facilities included recycling, a general store, showers, mobile phone charging stations and an internet cafe with free WiFi.<ref>{{cite web|title=On-Site Camping|url=http://www.coachella.com|website=Coachella.com|access-date=June 9, 2012|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|year=2012}}</ref>

==Talent booking==
Tollett begins to book artists for each festival as early as the previous August. In addition to agent pitches and artists discovered online, the lineup is culled from acts booked by Goldenvoice for their other 1,800 shows each year. Tollett uses the promoter's ticketing figures for insight into whom to book, saying: "There are AEG shows all across the country, and I see all their show lists and ticket counts. So I see little things that are happening maybe before some others, because they don't have that data."<ref name="cooltoalist"/> The booking process takes approximately six months.<ref name="mastermind"/>
According to the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', booking fees for most artists playing the festival allegedly start at $15,000 and extend into the "high six figures." Top-billed artists for 2010 were expected to receive over $1&nbsp;million.<ref name=lat-hiddencosts>{{cite web|title=Coachella and destination festivals: the hidden costs|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/music_blog/2010/04/coachella-and-destination-festivals-the-hidden-costs.html|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|first=Todd|last=Martens|date=April 15, 2010|access-date=April 1, 2015}}</ref> ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''{{'}}s sources estimated that non-headline acts can earn anywhere from $500 to $100,000.<ref name="cooltoalist">{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6516519/coachella-career-boosts|title=Coachella's Career-Making Magic: It Takes Artists From Cool to A-List|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|first=Jonathan|last=Ringen|date=March 30, 2015|access-date=April 3, 2015}}</ref> According to a 2017 profile on Tollett in ''[[The New Yorker]]'', that year's headlining performers received $3–4 million.<ref name="mastermind"/> Beyoncé's 2018 performances and Ariana Grande's 2019 performances reportedly garnered them each $8&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://people.com/music/coachella-2019-ariana-grande-beyonce-paid-8-million/|title=Ariana Grande and Beyoncé Were Paid the Same for Coachella — $4M Per Weekend for Total of $8M: Report|website=[[People (magazine)|People]]|first=Karen|last=Mizoguchi|date=April 19, 2019|access-date=April 19, 2019}}</ref>

In booking the festival, Goldenvoice uses [[radius clause]]s that can prevent acts from performing in the vicinity of Coachella for a certain amount of time before and after the festival. The promoter has allowed some of Coachella's acts to make appearances in the region prior to the festival and between weekends, but only at events and venues owned or controlled by Goldenvoice's parent company AEG; one such example was [[Jay-Z]]'s concert at Staples Center in 2010.<ref name=lat-hiddencosts/><ref name=kpcc-bendrules>{{cite web|title=Coachella organizers bend rules on bands playing non-festival venues|url=http://www.scpr.org/news/2012/04/17/32062/coachella-organizers-bend-rules-bands-playing-non-/|website=[[KPCC]]|first=Steven|last=Cuevas|date=April 17, 2012|access-date=April 1, 2015}}</ref><ref name=npr-coachella>{{cite web|title=Marooned in L.A.

*Cannot perform at any other North American festival from December 15 to May 1.
*Cannot play any hard ticket shows in Southern California from December 15 to May 1.
*Cannot "advertise, publicize or leak" performances for competing festivals in California, Nevada, Oregon, Washington, or Arizona, or headlining performances in Southern California taking place after May 1 until after May 7.
*Cannot announce festival appearances for the other 45 US states until after the January announcement of Coachella's lineup, except for [[South by Southwest]], [[Ultra Music Festival]], and the [[New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival]].
*Cannot publicize concerts in California, Arizona, Washington, or Oregon until after the January announcement of Coachella's lineup, except for performances in Las Vegas casinos.

Goldenvoice attempts to release the lineup poster as close to [[New Year's Day]] as possible, so that Coachella is the first major festival of the year to announce its lineup. This gives the promoter a competitive advantage over other festivals, many of which end up sharing headliners by the time they are all announced.<ref name="mastermind"/> The Coachella lineup poster lists its music artists across several lines in gradually decreasing [[Point (typography)|font sizes]] in descending order of prominence. The line on which an artist's name appears as well as their font size is a contentious topic between Goldenvoice and talent agents, as placement on the poster will often dictate an artist's future booking fee. Tollett said, "We have so many arguments over font sizes. I literally have {{wt|en|go to the mat|gone to the mat}} over one point size."<ref name="mastermind"/>

==Promotion and commercial partnerships==
Organizers were initially resistant to accepting sponsorship deals that would help Coachella turn a higher profit. In 2003, Tollett estimated that Goldenvoice could earn an additional $300,000 to $500,000 by adding a corporate sponsor to the festival name, but he did not want to violate the purity of the event. He said, "I hate it when you go to shows and you are bombarded with all this advertising. It just shows a lack of respect for your audience and the music."<ref name="indvision"/> Organizers have relaxed their opposition over the years. Brewing company [[Heineken N.V.]] has maintained a sponsorship with Coachella since 2002, and is the "official brew" of the festival.<ref>{{cite press release|url=https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-roots-and-de-la-soul-headline-a-newly-designed-heineken-house-at-coachella-300824798.html|title=The Roots And De La Soul Headline A Newly Designed Heineken House At Coachella|agency=[[PR Newswire]]|publisher=[[Heineken N.V.|Heineken USA]]|date=April 4, 2019|accessdate=May 19, 2019}}</ref> The company has sponsored a small performance venue at the festival called the "Heineken House" since 2014, where attendees can drink [[Heineken]] beers and keep their cases of Heineken refrigerated.<ref name="mw-heineken"/> Clothing retailer [[H&M]] added a small sponsored tent on the festival grounds in 2015,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thewrap.com/coachella-2015-hm-pops-new-tent-of-virtual-reality-360-degree-professional-selfies-exclusive/|title=Coachella 2015: H&M Pops New Tent of Virtual Reality, 360-Degree Professional Selfies (Exclusive)|work=[[TheWrap]]|first=Mikey|last=Glazer|date=March 19, 2015|access-date=April 24, 2015}}</ref> where attendees could purchase items from the company's Coachella-inspired clothing line called "H&M Loves Coachella".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://consequenceofsound.net/2015/03/hm-unveils-coachella-inspired-clothing-line/|title=H&M unveils Coachella-inspired clothing line|work=[[Consequence of Sound]]|first=Michelle|last=Geslani|date=March 27, 2015|access-date=April 1, 2015}}</ref> Information technology company [[HP Inc.|HP]] has sponsored the Antarctic dome since 2017,<ref name="hp-19"/> in addition to hosting a promotional tent.<ref name="variety-hp">{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2017/digital/news/coachella-antarctic-dome-sensory-experience-1202393325/|title=Coachella's Antarctic Dome Takes Viewers on Psychedelic Audio-Visual Journey|website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|first=Maane|last=Khatchatourian|date=April 24, 2017|access-date=May 19, 2019}}</ref> HP's promotions included allowing attendees to design and print bandanas and tote bags, capture [[light drawing]] [[GIF]]s, design kaleidoscopes, and interact with a motion-reactive wall.<ref name="hp-19"/><ref name="variety-hp"/> Tollett still objects to having the primary stages and tents sponsored: "I wouldn't let sponsors' logos on the stages.

The success of Coachella has led its organizers to partner with other American music festivals. In 2003, Goldenvoice agreed to work with the organizers of Field Day, a New York-based festival modeled after Coachella, to help promote and produce the event,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2003/apr/20/entertainment/ca-popeye20|title=Coachella concept gets a Long Island accent|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|first=Steve|last=Hochman|date=April 20, 2003|access-date=April 24, 2015}}</ref> although the show was completely overhauled from its original vision.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2003/jun/06/entertainment/et-quick6.1|title=Festival to go on but in new form|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|first=Geoff|last=Boucher|date=June 6, 2003|access-date=April 24, 2015}}</ref> In September 2014, Goldenvoice announced it had entered into a joint venture with Red Frog Events to help them promote and produce their [[Firefly Music Festival]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/business/6251743/coachella-goldenvoice-firefly-red-frog-joint-venture|title=Exclusive: Coachella and Firefly Founders Team Up on Joint Venture|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|first=Ray|last=Waddell|date=September 17, 2014|access-date=January 16, 2015}}</ref> In January 2015, a similar agreement was reached with the organizers of the [[Hangout Music Festival]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/13/business/media/coachella-organizers-in-deal-with-hangout-music-festival.html|title=Coachella Organizers in Deal With Hangout Music Festival|work=[[The New York Times]]|first=Ben|last=Sisario|date=January 12, 2015|access-date=January 16, 2015}}</ref>

===Brand protection===
Goldenvoice aggressively protects the Coachella [[brand]]. As of April 2018, they filed six lawsuits in the previous two years against outlets that attempted to use the Coachella name or the suffix "chella". The [[defendant]]s included the music festival Hoodchella; the film festival Filmchella; energy company [[Phillips 66]], which promoted a Coachella wristband giveaway that the festival's terms of services disallows; [[Sean Combs]]'s event "Combschella"; [[Urban Outfitters]]; and a [[Whole Foods Market|Whole Foods]] location in [[Palm Desert, California|Palm Desert]] that promoted a "Wholechella" concert and tasting event. According to Goldenvoice's attorneys in one lawsuit, the litigation is one way the promoter attempts to "extensively police unauthorized use of the Coachella Marks". Although the Coachella name has been in use by [[Coachella, California|a town in the Coachella Valley]] since before the festival was founded, the festival's success has imbued the name with "[[Trademark distinctiveness|secondary meaning]]", allowing Goldenvoice to [[trademark]] it.<ref name="brand-protect"/>

==Impact and legacy==
[[File:Bassnectar Live at Coachella Wknd 2.jpg|thumb|Fans attend a performance by [[Bassnectar]] at the Sahara tent in 2013]]
The success of Coachella in its early years proved that American music festivals could work and succeed in a destination form, as opposed to a traveling festival. In the years following Coachella's success, many other festivals have followed in its footsteps, copying its format as a destination festival with multiple stages, attractions, art, and camping.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} Some of these new festivals have grown to achieve the same success as Coachella, such as, [[Lollapalooza]] in [[Chicago]], [[Governors Ball Music Festival|Governors Ball]] in [[New York City]], [[Outside Lands Music and Arts Festival|Outside Lands]] in [[San Francisco]], [[Estéreo Picnic Festival|Stereo Picnic]] in [[Bogotá]] and [[Bonnaroo Music Festival|Bonnaroo]] in [[Tennessee]].

The success of Coachella led to Goldenvoice holding additional music festivals at the Empire Polo Club. It founded the country music festival Stagecoach in 2007 and continues to hold it on an annual basis. In 2011, the promoter staged the Big 4 festival, so-named for its quadruple billing of the most prominent bands in [[thrash metal]]—[[Anthrax (American band)|Anthrax]], [[Megadeth]], [[Metallica]], and [[Slayer (band)|Slayer]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/inside-the-plans-for-the-big-4-metal-reunion-249288/|title=Inside the Plans for the 'Big 4' Metal Reunion|website=[[Rolling Stone]]|first=Steve|last=Appleford|date=January 26, 2011|access-date=May 27, 2019}}</ref> In 2016, Goldenvoice staged [[Desert Trip]], which featured older rock oriented and legacy acts such as [[the Rolling Stones]], [[Paul McCartney]], and [[Bob Dylan]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/music/la-et-ms-desert-trip-parties-20161003-snap-story.html|title='Old-chella'?
