'''The Grenadier Guards''' (GREN GDS) is an [[infantry]] [[regiment]] of the [[British Army]]. It can trace its lineage back to 1656 when [[Lord Wentworth's Regiment]] was raised in [[Bruges]] to protect the exiled [[Charles II of England|Charles II]].<ref name = GG>{{cite web|url=http://www.army.mod.uk/infantry/regiments/7453.aspx|title=History - British Army Website: ''Grenadier Guards''|date=2010-09-29|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100929144845/http://www.army.mod.uk/infantry/regiments/7453.aspx|archive-date=2010-09-29|access-date=2019-10-19}}</ref> In 1665, this regiment was combined with [[John Russell's Regiment of Guards]] to form the current regiment, known as the 1st Regiment of Foot Guards.  Since then, the regiment has filled both a ceremonial and protective role as well as an operational one. In 1900, the regiment provided a [[Cadre (military)|cadre]] of personnel to form the [[Irish Guards]]; while later, in 1915 it also provided the basis of the [[Welsh Guards]] upon their formation.

The regiment's early history saw it take part in numerous conflicts including the [[War of Spanish Succession]], the [[War of Austrian Succession]], the [[Seven Years' War]], and the [[Napoleonic Wars]]; at the end of this period the regiment was granted the "Grenadier" designation by a Royal Proclamation.  During the [[Victorian Era]], the regiment took part in the [[Crimean War]], the [[Anglo-Egyptian War]], the [[Mahdist War]], and the [[Second Boer War]].  

During the [[First World War]], the Grenadier Guards was expanded from three [[battalion]]s to five, of which four served on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]], while later during the [[Second World War]], six battalions were raised, and several were converted to an armoured role as part of the [[Guards Armoured Division]]. These units fought in [[Battle of France|France]], [[North-West Europe Campaign of 1944–45|North-West Europe]], [[North African campaign|North Africa]] and [[Italian campaign (World War II)|Italy]]. 

After the Second World War the regiment was reduced first to three battalions, then to two, and finally to one battalion in the mid-1990s. Major deployments during this time have included operations in [[1947–1948 civil war in Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]], [[Malayan Emergency|Malaya]], [[Cyprus Emergency|Cyprus]], [[Northern Ireland]], the [[Gulf War]], [[War in Afghanistan (2001-present)|Afghanistan]] and [[Iraq War|Iraq]].

==History==
The Grenadier Guards trace their lineage back to 1656,<ref>{{harvnb|Fraser|1998|p=4}}</ref> when [[Lord Wentworth's Regiment]] was raised from gentlemen of the [[Honourable Artillery Company]] by the then heir to the throne, Prince Charles (later [[King of England|King]] [[Charles II of England|Charles II]]), in [[Bruges]], in the [[Spanish Netherlands]] (present-day Belgium), where it formed a part of the exiled King's bodyguard.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/britain-and-belgium-mark-360th-anniversary-of-the-grenadier-guards |title=Britain and Belgium mark 360th anniversary of the Grenadier Guards |date=2 September 2016 |publisher=Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|access-date=4 September 2016}}</ref> A few years later, a similar regiment known as [[John Russell's Regiment of Guards]] was formed.<ref name=Fraser6>{{harvnb|Fraser|1998|p=6}}</ref> In 1665, these two regiments were combined to form the 1st Regiment of Foot Guards, consisting of 24 [[Company (military unit)|companies]] of men.<ref name=Fraser6/> Since then the Grenadier Guards have served ten Kings and four Queens, including the current [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]]. Throughout the 18th century, the regiment took part in a number of campaigns including the [[War of Spanish Succession]], the [[War of Austrian Succession]] and the [[Seven Years' War]].<ref>{{harvnb|Fraser|1998|pp=7–9}}</ref> At the end of the [[Napoleonic Wars]], the regiment gained the name "Grenadier" in July 1815 following a Royal Proclamation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.grengds.com/uploads/files/filepath_444.pdf|title=Branch notes (Northamptonshire)|page=108|publisher=The Grenadier Gazette|date=2014|access-date=9 September 2016}}</ref>

[[File:Grenadier Guards.jpg|left|thumb|A Grenadier Guard, 1889]]

During the Victorian era, the regiment took part in the [[Crimean War]], participating in the fighting at [[Battle of the Alma|the Alma river]], [[Battle of Inkerman|Inkerman]], and [[Siege of Sevastopol (1854–1855)|Sevastopol]].<ref>{{harvnb|Fraser|1998|pp=14–15}}</ref> For their involvement in the Crimean War, four members of the 3rd Battalion received the [[Victoria Cross]].<ref name=Fraser17>{{harvnb|Fraser|1998|p=17}}</ref> Later the regiment fought at [[Battle of Tel el-Kebir]] during the [[1882 Anglo-Egyptian War|Anglo-Egyptian War]] in 1882, and then the [[Mahdist War]] in [[Sudan]], both during the 1885 [[Suakin Expedition]] and in 1898, at the [[Battle of Omdurman]].<ref name=Fraser17/> During the [[Second Boer War]], the 2nd and 3rd Battalions were deployed to South Africa, where they took part in a number of battles including the [[Battle of Modder River]] and the [[Battle of Belmont (1899)|Battle of Belmont]], as well as a number of smaller actions.<ref name=Fraser18>{{harvnb|Fraser|1998|p=18}}</ref> In 1900, seventy-five men from the regiment were used to raise a fourth Guards regiment, known as the [[Irish Guards]] in honour of the role that Irish regiments had played in the fighting in South Africa.<ref name=Fraser20>{{harvnb|Fraser|1998|p=20}}</ref>

At the outbreak of the [[World War I|First World War]] in August 1914, the regiment consisted of three battalions.<ref name=Chappell4>{{harvnb|Chappell|1997|p=4}}</ref> With the commencement of hostilities, the regiment raised a service battalion, the 4th Battalion, and a reserve battalion, known as the 5th (Reserve) Battalion, which was used to carry out ceremonial duties in London and Windsor during the war.<ref name=Chappell4/> The 2nd Battalion of the regiment was sent to [[France]] in August,<ref>{{harvnb|Craster|Jeffrey|1976|pp=13–14}}</ref> and the 1st Battalion followed to Belgium in October. They took part in the early stages of the fighting during the period known as "[[Race to the Sea]]", during which time they were involved significantly at the [[First Battle of Ypres]].<ref>{{harvnb|Fraser|1998|p=21}}</ref> In February 1915, a fifth Guards regiment was raised, known as [[The Welsh Guards]].<ref name="Fraser20"/> In recognition of the significant contribution Welshmen had made to The Grenadier Guards, the regiment transferred five officers and 634 other ranks to the newly formed unit.<ref>{{harvnb|Chappell|1997|p=5}}</ref> A short time later, permission was received for the formation of the [[British Guards Division|Guards Division]], the brainchild of [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Lord Kitchener]], and on 18 August 1915, the division came into existence, consisting of three brigades, each with four battalions.<ref name=Fraser20/><ref>{{harvnb|Chappell|1997|p=6}}</ref> Following this the four service battalions of the regiment fought in a number of significant battles including [[Battle of Loos|Loos]], [[Battle of the Somme (1916)|the Somme]], [[Battle of Cambrai (1917)|Cambrai]], [[Battle of Arras (1918)|Arras]] and the [[Hindenburg Line]].<ref>{{harvnb|Fraser|1998|pp=19–22}}</ref> Seven members of the regiment received the Victoria Cross during the war.<ref name=Fraser18/>

Following the [[Armistice with Germany]] in November 1918, the regiment returned to just three battalions, which were used in a variety of roles, serving at home in the United Kingdom, as well as in France, Turkey and Egypt.<ref>{{harvnb|Fraser|1998|p=22}}</ref>

===Second World War===
During the [[World War II|Second World War]], the regiment was expanded to six service battalions, with the re-raising of the 4th Battalion, and the establishment of the 5th and 6th Battalions.<ref name=Fraser23>{{harvnb|Fraser|1998|p=23}}</ref> The Grenadier Guards' first involvement in the war came in the early stages of the fighting when all three regular battalions were sent to France in late 1939 as part of the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|British Expeditionary Force]] (BEF).<ref name=Fraser24>{{harvnb|Fraser|1998|p=24}}</ref> The 1st and 2nd Battalions were serving in the [[7th Infantry Brigade and Headquarters East|7th Guards Brigade]], which also included the 1st Battalion, [[Coldstream Guards]], and were part of the [[3rd Division (United Kingdom)|3rd Infantry Division]], led by [[Major-general (United Kingdom)|Major General]] [[Bernard Montgomery]]. The 3rd Battalion was in the [[1st Armoured Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|1st Guards Brigade]] attached to the [[1st Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|1st Infantry Division]], commanded by Major General [[Harold Alexander, 1st Earl Alexander of Tunis|Harold Alexander]].<ref>{{harvnb|Forbes|1949|p=4}}</ref> As the BEF was pushed back by the German blitzkrieg during the battles of [[Battle of France|France]] and [[Battle of Dunkirk|Dunkirk]], these battalions played a considerable role in maintaining the British Army's reputation during the withdrawal phase of the campaign before being themselves [[Dunkirk evacuation|evacuated from Dunkirk]].<ref name=Fraser24/> After this, they returned to the United Kingdom, where they undertook defensive duties in anticipation of a possible [[Operation Sea Lion|German invasion]]. Between October 1940 and October 1941, the regiment raised the 4th, 5th, and 6th Battalions.<ref>{{harvnb|Forbes|1949|pp=53–56}}</ref> Later, in the summer of 1941, there was a need to increase the number of armoured and motorised units in the British Army and as a result many infantry battalions were converted into armoured regiments; the 2nd and 4th Battalions were re-equipped with tanks, while the 1st Battalion was motorised.<ref>{{harvnb|Forbes|1949|p=59}}</ref> The 1st and 2nd (Armoured) Battalions were part of the [[5th Guards Armoured Brigade]], attached to the [[Guards Armoured Division]],<ref>{{harvnb|Forbes|1949|p=56}}</ref> and the 4th Battalion was part of the [[6th Guards Tank Brigade (United Kingdom)|6th Guards Tank Brigade Group]]. They subsequently served in the [[North West Europe Campaign]] of 1944–45, taking part in several actions, including the [[Battle for Caen]], particularly in [[Operation Goodwood]], as well as [[Operation Market Garden]], the [[Battle of the Bulge]] and [[Operation Veritable]].<ref>{{harvnb|Chappell|1997|pp=28–55}}</ref>

The 3rd, 5th and 6th Battalions served in the [[North African Campaign]] and in the final stages of the [[Tunisia Campaign]], under command of the [[First Army (United Kingdom)|British First Army]], where they fought significant battles in the [[Medjez el Bab|Medjez-el-Bab]] and along the [[Mareth Line]]. The battalions took part in the [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|Italian Campaign]] at [[Allied invasion of Italy#Salerno landings|Salerno]], [[Bernhardt Line|Monte Camino]], [[Battle of Anzio|Anzio]], [[Battle of Monte Cassino|Monte Cassino]], and along the [[Gothic Line]].<ref name=Fraser24/><ref>{{harvnb|Nicolson|1949|pp=vii–ix}}</ref> The 3rd Battalion, still with the 1st Guards Brigade, was attached to the [[78th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|78th ''Battleaxe'' Infantry Division]] for two months in Tunisia until it was exchanged for the [[38th (Irish) Brigade]] and became part of the [[6th Armoured Division (United Kingdom)|6th Armoured Division]], where it would remain for the rest of the war.<ref>{{harvnb|Nicolson|1949|pp=268 & 281}}</ref> The 5th Battalion was part of [[24th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|24th Guards Brigade]] and served with the 1st Division during the Battle of Anzio.

===After the Second World War===

In June 1945, following the end of hostilities, the 2nd and 4th Battalions gave up their tanks and returned to an infantry role.<ref>{{harvnb|Forbes|1949|p=253}}</ref> The regiment returned to three battalions at this time, with the 4th and 5th Battalions being disbanded along with the 6th, which had been removed from the order of battle before the end of the war.<ref name=Fraser26>{{harvnb|Fraser|1998|p=26}}</ref> Initially, the regiment was employed on occupation duties in Germany; however, the 3rd Battalion was deployed shortly afterwards to [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], where it attempted to keep the peace until May 1948, when it was replaced by the 1st Battalion. Further deployments came to [[Federation of Malaya|Malaya]] in 1949, [[Tripoli]] in 1951 and [[British Cyprus|Cyprus]] in 1956.<ref>{{harvnb|Fraser|1998|pp=26–27}}</ref> In 1960, shortly after returning from Cyprus, the 3rd Battalion paraded for the last time<ref name=Fraser28>{{harvnb|Fraser|1998|p=28}}</ref> and was subsequently placed in suspended animation. In order to maintain the battalion's customs and traditions, one of its companies, the Inkerman Company, was incorporated into the 1st Battalion.<ref name=history>{{cite web|url=http://www.army.mod.uk/documents/general/History_Grenadier_Guards.pdf|title=History of the Grenadier Guards|publisher=British Army|access-date=18 July 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120925005657/http://www.army.mod.uk/documents/general/History_Grenadier_Guards.pdf|archive-date=25 September 2012}}</ref>

Since the mid-1960s, the 1st and 2nd Battalions have been deployed to [[Africa]], [[South America]] and [[Northern Ireland]] where they undertook peacekeeping duties. They also undertook duties as part of the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organisation|NATO]] force stationed in Germany during the [[Cold War]].<ref>{{harvnb|Fraser|1998|pp=28–29}}</ref> In 1991, the 1st Battalion, which had been serving in Germany, was deployed to the Middle East, where it took part in the [[Gulf War|Persian Gulf War]] mounted in [[Warrior tracked armoured vehicle|Warrior armoured personnel carriers]], before returning for a six-month tour of Northern Ireland.<ref name=history/>

In 1994, under the ''[[Options for Change]]'' reforms, The Grenadier Guards was reduced to a single battalion. The 2nd Battalion was put into 'suspended animation', and its [[colours and guidons|colours]] passed for safekeeping to a newly formed [[Guards Incremental Companies|independent company]], which was named [[Guards Incremental Companies|"The Nijmegen Company"]].<ref name=web>{{cite web|url=http://www.army.mod.uk/infantry/regiments/3485.aspx|title=Grenadier Guards|publisher=British Army|access-date=18 July 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100722003449/http://www.army.mod.uk/infantry/regiments/3485.aspx|archive-date=22 July 2010}}</ref> As a result of this, the regiment was reduced to its current composition: one full battalion, the 1st Battalion, consisting of three rifle companies (The Queen's Company, Number Two Company and Inkerman Company), a support company and a headquarters company, based at [[Wellington Barracks]], London, and one independent company, The Nijmegen Company.<ref name=web/> [[Queen Elizabeth II|The Queen]], as Colonel-in-Chief, presented new colours to the Nijmegen Company in 2013.<ref>{{cite news|title=Grenadier Guards honoured by the Queen at Buckingham Palace|url=http://www.newsletter.co.uk/news/regional/grenadier-guards-honoured-by-the-queen-at-buckingham-palace-1-5226685}}</ref>

==Current role==

The Queen's Company of The Grenadier Guards traditionally provides the pallbearers for all deceased monarchs.<ref name="Fraser40"/>

The Grenadier Guards and other Guards regiments have a long-standing connection to [[Parachute Regiment (United Kingdom)|The Parachute Regiment]]. Guardsmen who have completed [[P company|P Company]] are transferred into the Guards Parachute Platoon, which is currently attached to the 3rd Battalion, The Parachute Regiment. The Guards Parachute Platoon maintains the tradition established by No 1 (Guards) Independent Parachute Company that was part of the original [[Pathfinder Group]] of [[16th Parachute Brigade]], which has since been designated as the [[16th Air Assault Brigade]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.paradata.org.uk/units/no-1-guards-independent-parachute-company |title=No 1 (Guards) Independent Parachute Company |publisher=ParaData |access-date=10 January 2013}}</ref>

==Battle honours==
The 1st Foot Guards has received 78 [[battle honour]]s,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.grengds.com/static.php?content_id=56 |title=Battle Honours - History of the Grenadier Guards - History and Archives - Grenadier Guards |publisher=Grengds.com |access-date=2020-05-19}}</ref> gained for its involvement in a number of conflicts including:
* the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], (1701–1714) including [[Battle of Oudenarde|Oudenarde]]
* the [[War of the Austrian Succession]] (1740–1748)

* the [[Second World War]] (North Africa, Italy, Northwest Europe) (1939–1945)
* the [[Gulf War|Persian Gulf War]] (1990–1991)

==Training==

Recruits to the [[Guards Division]] go through a gruelling thirty-week training programme at the [[Infantry Training Centre (British Army)|Infantry Training Centre]] (ITC). The training is two weeks longer than the training for the Regular [[line infantry]] regiments of the British Army; the extra training, carried out throughout the course, is devoted to drill and ceremonies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.army.mod.uk/training_education/24572.aspx |title=Combat Infantryman's Course – Foot Guards|publisher=Ministry of Defence|access-date=27 April 2014}}</ref>
