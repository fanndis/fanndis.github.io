'''''The Handmaid's Tale''''' is an American [[Utopian and dystopian fiction|dystopian]] [[tragedy]] [[television series]] created by [[Bruce Miller (producer)|Bruce Miller]], based on the [[The Handmaid's Tale|1985 novel of the same name]] by Canadian author [[Margaret Atwood]]. The series was ordered by the streaming service [[Hulu]] as a straight-to-series order of 10 episodes, for which production began in late 2016. The plot features a [[dystopia]] following a [[Second American Civil War]] wherein a [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]] society subjects fertile women, called "[[Handmaiden|Handmaids]]", to child-bearing slavery.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/05/handmaids-tale-recap-season-2-episode-3-what-are-econowives-book-offred-escape |title=The Handmaid's Tale: Why Offred's Latest Heartbreak Is the Most Devastating Yet |last=Bradley |first=Laura |date=May 2, 2018 |work=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]] |accessdate=June 27, 2018 |quote=In its third installment, however, the drama digs even deeper into the emotional toll Gilead has taken on everyone—both those left in what was once the United States and those who’ve made it out.

Worldwide infertility has led to the enslavement of fertile women in Gilead determined by the new regime to be "fallen women", citing an extremist interpretation of the [[Bible#Christian Bible|Biblical]] account of [[Bilhah]]; these women often include those who have entered multiple marriages (termed "adulteresses"), single or unmarried mothers, lesbians (homosexuals being termed "gender traitors"), non-Christians, adherents of Christian denominations other than the Sons of Jacob, political dissidents and academics.

Handmaids are given names created by the addition of the prefix Of- to the first name of the man who has them. When they are transferred, their names are changed accordingly.

Along with the Handmaids, much of society is now grouped into classes that dictate their freedoms and duties. Women are divided into a small range of social categories, each one signified by a [[plain dress]] in a specific color. Handmaids wear long red dresses, heavy brown boots and white coifs, with a larger white coif (known as "wings") to be worn outside, concealing them from public view and restricting their vision. Marthas (who are housekeepers and cooks, named after [[Martha|the biblical figure]]) wear long, loose-fitting muted green garments and cover their hair with headwraps. The Wives of Commanders (who are expected to run their households beautifully) wear elegant, tailored dresses in blue and various shades of teal, cut in styles evoking the 1950s. They wear high heels, their hair is carefully coiffed, and they wear gloves and hats when outdoors.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.vulture.com/2017/04/the-handmaids-tale-beginners-guide.html |title=A Beginner's Guide to The Handmaid's Tale Universe |work=Vulture |first=Laura |last=Hudson |date=April 25, 2017 |accessdate=May 12, 2019 |archive-date=May 12, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190512181447/https://www.vulture.com/2017/04/the-handmaids-tale-beginners-guide.html |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/handmaid-s-tale-costume-designer-under-his-eye-gala-dresses-1222441 |title='Handmaid's Tale' Costume Designer Breaks Down "Fascist New Year's Eve Party" Looks |work=The Hollywood Reporter |first=Ingrid |last=Schmidt |date=July 3, 2019 |accessdate=July 24, 2020 |archive-date=July 24, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200724212738/https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/handmaid-s-tale-costume-designer-under-his-eye-gala-dresses-1222441 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.vulture.com/2017/04/handmaids-tale-costumes-how-they-came-together.html |title=From the Handmaids to the Marthas, How Each Handmaid’s Tale Costume Came Together |work=Vulture |first=E.

Econowives, the lower-class women who still have minimal [[Agency (philosophy)|agency]], wear shades of gray (a departure from the book in which Econowives wear clothing striped with the aforementioned colors). Female prisoners are called Unwomen and, wearing rags, are worked to death clearing toxic waste in the Colonies.

Another class of women, Aunts, who wear brown, train, oversee and discipline the Handmaids as well as organize "particicutions” (public executions involving the coerced participation of Handmaids). They are the only class of women in Gilead permitted to read, albeit specifically to fulfill the administrative role of their caste. Jezebels, often former career professionals or academics unwilling or unable to accept any role in Gilead, are forced into prostitution in secret brothels catering to the elite ruling class as an alternative punishment to being executed or sent to the Colonies. They wear otherwise forbidden evening clothes, costumes, and lingerie from “before”.

Among the men of Gilead other than the Commanders, the Eyes are secret police watching over the general populace for signs of rebellion, Hunters track down people attempting to flee the country, Guardians are responsible for civilian policing and Economen are responsible for menial labor. Men, regardless of status or position, often wear black.

June Osborne, renamed Offred, is the Handmaid assigned to the home of the Gileadan Commander Fred Waterford and his wife Serena Joy. The Waterfords, key players in the formation and rise of Gilead, struggle with the realities of the society they helped create.

During "the time before", June was married to Luke and had a daughter, Hannah. At the beginning of the story, while attempting to flee Gilead with her husband and daughter, June was captured and forced to become a Handmaid because of the adultery she and her husband committed. June's daughter was taken and given to an upper-class family to raise, and her husband escaped into Canada. Much of the plot revolves around June's desire to be reunited with her husband and daughter.

==Cast and characters==
{{main|List of The Handmaid's Tale characters}}

===Main===
* [[Elisabeth Moss]] as June Osborne / Offred / Ofjoseph, a woman who was captured while attempting to escape to Canada with her husband, Luke, and daughter, Hannah. Due to her fertility, she is made a Handmaid to Commander Fred Waterford and his wife, Serena Joy as "Offred". Now she is with Commander Joseph Lawrence as "Ofjoseph".
* [[Joseph Fiennes]] as Commander Fred Waterford, a high-ranking government official and June's former master. Both he and his wife were instrumental in Gilead's founding. He wishes to have more contact with June outside of what is lawful between a Handmaid and her master, and starts inviting her to play nightly games of ''[[Scrabble]]''.
* [[Yvonne Strahovski]] as Serena Joy Waterford, Fred's wife and a former conservative cultural activist. She appears to have accepted her new role in a society that she helped create. She is poised and deeply religious, but capable of great cruelty and is often callous to June. She is desperate to become a mother.
* [[Alexis Bledel]] as Dr. Emily Malek Ph.D. / Ofglen #1 / Ofsteven / Ofroy / Ofjoseph #1, June's shopping partner. Although June is initially wary of her, it is revealed she is not as pious as she seems, and the two become friends. Emily has a wife and son living in Canada and was a university lecturer in cellular biology. Being homosexual is punishable by death in Gilead, and while most intellectuals are worked to their deaths in the Colonies or executed, Emily, as "Ofglen", was spared and later converted into a Handmaid, due to her having "two viable ovaries". She was later captured and cruelly punished as a "gender traitor" for her lesbian relationship with a Martha, and is sent to another household where she becomes "Ofsteven". She is involved with a resistance movement called "Mayday". She was in the process of being worked to death in the toxic fields of the Colonies until the attack on the Red Center had her, Janine, and several others returned to Gilead to resume service as handmaids. After attacking Aunt Lydia at the Lawrence household, she as "Ofjoseph" fears execution, until Commander Lawrence sends her away in a truck with the baby Nichole, whom June hands to her before ditching them to free her other daughter Hannah. Both Emily and Nichole manage to flee to Canada, where Emily is soon reunited with her wife and son. Baby Nichole is placed in the care of Luke and Moira.
* [[Madeline Brewer]] as Janine Lindo / Ofwarren / Ofdaniel / Ofhoward, a Handmaid who entered the Red Center for training at the same time as June, and considers June a friend due to her kind treatment. Initially non-compliant, Janine has her right eye removed as a punishment. She becomes mentally unstable due to her treatment and often behaves in temperamental or childlike ways. She gives birth to a child for Warren and Naomi Putnam, whom they name "Angela", but Janine insists the baby's name is "Charlotte". Janine is later reassigned and becomes "Ofdaniel". She was temporarily admitted to the Colonies until a bombing leveled the new Rachel and Leah Center on the day of its christening.
* [[Ann Dowd]] as Aunt Lydia / Lydia Clements, a woman in charge of overseeing the Handmaids in their sexual reeducation and duties. She is brutal and subjects insubordinate Handmaids to harsh physical punishment, but she also cares for her charges and believes deeply in the Gileadean mission and doctrine. She appears to have a soft spot for Janine and even goes so far as to address her by her given name on occasion. Before Gilead, she was a religious elementary school teacher named Miss Clements.
* [[O. T. Fagbenle]] as Luke Bankole, June's husband from before Gilead. Because he is divorced (he and June began their relationship before his divorce from his first wife), their union is nullified in this new society. June is considered an adulteress and their daughter, Hannah, is deemed illegitimate. Initially, June believes he was killed, but it is later revealed Luke managed to escape to Canada.
* [[Max Minghella]] as Commander Nick Blaine, Commander Waterford's driver and a former drifter from Michigan who has feelings for June. June and Nick develop an intimate relationship and she eventually discovers that he is an Eye, a spy for Gilead. In season 3, he is promoted to Commander.
* [[Samira Wiley]] as Moira Strand, June's best friend since college. She is already at the Red Center when June enters Handmaid training but escapes before being assigned to a home. She is recaptured and becomes "Ruby", a Jezebel. She seems to have given up hope of ever being free, but on meeting June again regains the conviction to escape.

===Recurring===
* [[Stephen Kunken]] as Commander Warren Putnam. He's the first known Commander of Janine. He had his left hand amputated by the Council after being found guilty of adultery.
* [[Kristian Bruun]] (season 1–2) as a Doctor in Gilead who treats June.
* [[Ever Carradine]] as Naomi Putnam, Commander Warren Putnam's wife.
* [[Tattiawna Jones]] as Lillie Fuller / Ofglen #2 (seasons 1–2), who replaces Emily in the position after Emily is captured by the Eyes. She initially follows the rules and does not wish to upset the status quo, but this is because she believes her life as a Handmaid is better than the difficult, impoverished life she led prior to Gilead, rather than out of religious piety. After refusing to stone Janine, she was clubbed with a rifle by a Guardian, and her tongue (according to Alma) was cut out. After that, she sacrifices herself to bomb a new Red Center on the day of its christening. 26 Commanders and 31 Handmaids were killed as a result.
* [[Nina Kiri]] as Alma / Ofrobert, another Handmaid who trained at the Red Center with June, Moira, and Janine. She is frank and chatty, and often trades gossip and news with June. She is also involved with Mayday and becomes June's first contact with the resistance group.

* Bahia Watson as Brianna / Oferic, another local Handmaid who is friends with June.
* Jordana Blake as Hannah Bankole / Agnes MacKenzie, June and Luke's daughter. She is later renamed Agnes MacKenzie.
* Edie Inksetter as Aunt Elizabeth, a fellow Aunt who works closely with Aunt Lydia at the Red Center.
* [[Kristen Gutoskie]] as Beth (season 1, season 3-present), a chef before the rise of Gilead, formerly a Martha at Jezebel's. She had an arrangement with Nick whereby she traded illegal alcohol and other contraband for drugs, which the Jezebels use. She has a casual sexual relationship with him and is aware that he is an Eye. She later becomes a Martha in Joseph Lawrence's household.

The site's critical consensus reads, "''The Handmaid's Tale''{{'}}s third season reins in its horrors and inspires hope that revolution really is possible – if only the story would stop spinning its wheels and get to it already."<ref name="RT-S3">{{cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/the_handmaid_s_tale/s03 |title=The Handmaid's Tale: Season 3 |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |accessdate=July 22, 2019 |archive-date=June 19, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190619230541/https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/the_handmaid_s_tale/s03/ |url-status=live }}</ref> On Metacritic, it has a weighted average score of 68 out of 100 based on 14 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".<ref name="MC-S3">{{cite web |url=https://www.metacritic.com/tv/the-handmaids-tale/season-3 |title=The Handmaid's Tale: Season 3 |website=[[Metacritic]] |accessdate=June 5, 2019 |archive-date=June 3, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190603044217/https://www.metacritic.com/tv/the-handmaids-tale/season-3 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Kelly Lawler of ''[[USA Today]]'' gave it a positive review, scoring it three out of four stars. She claimed it is an improvement over the second season, "that rights many – though definitely not all – of Season 2's wrongs." Overall, she wrote, "The new season is more propulsive and watchable, although it doesn't quite reach the heights of that first moving season. But ''Handmaid's'' regains its footing by setting off on a new path".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/tv/2019/05/29/the-handmaids-tale-season-3-review-elisabeth-moss-hulu/1259775001/ |title=Review: 'The Handmaid's Tale' bounces back for a rousing Season 3 |work=USA Today |first=Kelly |last=Lawler |date=May 29, 2019 |accessdate=May 31, 2019 |archive-date=May 31, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190531142129/https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/tv/2019/05/29/the-handmaids-tale-season-3-review-elisabeth-moss-hulu/1259775001/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

Daniel Fienberg of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' wrote a generally positive review, praising Elisabeth Moss's performance and the cinematography, but criticized the plot "that has become frustratingly repetitive". Overall, he wrote, "Still occasionally powerful, but rarely as provocative".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/handmaids-tale-review-1214023 |title='The Handmaid's Tale' Season 3: TV Review |work=The Hollywood Reporter |first=Daniel |last=Fienberg |date=May 29, 2019 |accessdate=May 31, 2019 |archive-date=May 31, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190531142128/https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/handmaids-tale-review-1214023 |url-status=live }}</ref>
