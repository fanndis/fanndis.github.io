A '''parachute candidate''' (also known as a "[[carpetbagger]]" in the [[United States]]) is a pejorative term<ref name="NDP-crit">{{cite news|title=NDP criticized for running parachute candidate in Labrador|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/ndp-criticized-for-running-parachute-candidate-in-labrador-1.734870|accessdate=24 Feb 2015|publisher=[[CBC News]]|date=19 September 2008}}</ref> for an [[election]] [[candidate]] who does not live in and has little connection to the area they are running to represent. The allegation is thus that the candidate is being “parachuted in” for the job by a desperate [[political party]] that has no reliable talent indigenous to the district or state or that the party (or the candidate himself/herself) wishes to give a candidate an easier election than would happen in one's own home area.

==Canada==

*[[Chrystia Freeland]] faced allegations of being parachuted in by the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal Party]] to contest a 2013 by-election in safe seat [[Toronto Centre]], given she was living in [[New York City]] at the time.

*In 2008, the [[New Democratic Party]] nominated Phyllis Artiss of [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador|St. John's]] for the riding of [[Labrador (electoral district)|Labrador]]. Artiss was nominated in the absence of any local candidate, and admitted that her candidacy was not ideal: "It would be much better to have someone from Labrador who has lived there all their lives or much of their lives and worked there, and I haven't done that."<ref name="NDP-crit" />
*[[Kellie Leitch]] was accused of being a parachute candidate when she sought the [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservative]] nomination in the riding of [[Simcoe-Grey]] in [[Ontario]].

* In 2017 [[Deborah Russell]] won selection for the safe Labour seat of [[New Lynn (New Zealand electorate)|New Lynn]], in south-east [[Auckland]] despite being from [[Whangamōmona]], a small town in the [[Manawatū-Whanganui]] region. She beat out Greg Presland a New Lynn resident for 30 years who had the backing of the local members but lost to Russell who was backed by Labour's Council because of her finance expertise and a pledge to have more women in electorates. Upon winning selection Russell moved to the electorate.<ref>{{cite web |author=Trevett, Claire |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=11788733 |title=Battle to replace Labour's David Cunliffe in New Lynn heats up |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |date=25 January 2017 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=Ali, Mahvash |url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/auckland/local-news/western-leader/90091542/the-taranaki-girl-who-wants-to-win-over-new-lynn |title=The "Taranaki girl" who wants to win over New Lynn |publisher=[[Stuff (website)|Stuff]] |date=6 March 2017}}</ref>

==United Kingdom==
Parachute candidates are common in the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]]. The [[Westminster system]] historically emphasizes [[party discipline]] over responsiveness to constituencies. [[Margaret Thatcher]] represented [[Finchley (UK Parliament constituency)|Finchley]] despite living in [[Chelsea, London]].{{r|economist20141211}}

A 2013 [[YouGov]] survey found that support for a hypothetical candidate rose by 12 points after voters learned that his opponent had moved to the area two years earlier, and by 30 points if the opponent lived 120 miles away. The percentage of local MPs rose, according to Michael Rush of the [[University of Exeter]], from 25% in [[1979 United Kingdom general election|1979]] to 45% in [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997]]; Ralph Scott of [[Demos (UK think tank)|Demos]] calculates that {{asof|2014|lc=y}} 63% are local.{{r|economist20141211}}

According to surveys public trust in all MPs has decreased but trust in the local MP has increased, making pre-existing connections to seats more important. Election advertisements mention the candidate's party or party leader less often, and emphasize local connections. Such a change produces MPs that are more attentive to local issues, but may be detrimental to Britain's [[first-past-the-post system]] designed to create broad parties that [[party whip]]s stabilize.{{r|economist20141211}}

*[[Roy Jenkins]] was so unfamiliar with [[Glasgow]], he later wrote, that on arrival to campaign for the [[1982 Glasgow Hillhead by-election]] its skyline was "as mysterious to me as the [[List of mosques in Istanbul|minarets of Constantinople]]" to Russian troops during the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878)|Russo-Turkish War]].<ref name="economist20141211">{{Cite magazine |date=2014-12-11 |title=No more parachuting in |url=https://www.economist.com/britain/2014/12/11/no-more-parachuting-in |magazine=The Economist |issn=0013-0613 |access-date=2020-07-08}}</ref> Jenkins won the election, taking the seat from the [[Scottish Conservatives]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.election.demon.co.uk/by1979.html|title=Results of Byelections in the 1979-83 Parliament|last=Boothroyd|first=David|access-date=2015-09-19|website=United Kingdom Election Results}}</ref>
*[[Shaun Woodward]] defected from the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] to the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] in 1999.

*[[Luciana Berger]] was an example of Labour parachuting a middle-class southerner into one of its traditional heartland seats, in her case the northern working-class safe seat of [[Liverpool Wavertree (UK Parliament constituency)|Liverpool Wavertree]]. She was heavily criticised for having no connection to the Wavertree constituency or Liverpool when she first ran in 2010. When asked by a local radio station to answer basic questions about Liverpool she was unable to, and during the candidate selection process stayed at local MP [[Jane Kennedy (politician)|Jane Kennedy]]'s house rather than make any permanent home in the area. The media raised suggestions that she was only selected for the seat because of her close connections to the Blair family.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/crash-landing-for-labour-candidate-parachuted-into-liverpool-1951962.html|title=Crash landing for Labour candidate parachuted into Liverpool|date=23 April 2010|work=[[The Independent]]}}</ref> She went on to win the seat in 2010 and retain it in 2015 and 2017.

She made the decision to stand there because of the seat's high Jewish population and [[Brexit|Remain]] vote, as well as her affinity towards living in London and choice to raise her children there, rather than in Liverpool.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/luciana-berger-to-stand-for-liberal-democrats-in-finchley-golders-green-1.489253|title=Luciana Berger to stand for Lib Dems in Finchley and Golders Green|last=|first=|date=|website=www.thejc.com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-10-01}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/luciana-berger-to-stand-for-lib-dems-in-north-london-seat-once-held-by-margaret-thatcher-a4246931.html|title=Lib Dems recruit Luciana Berger to stand in north London seat|date=2019-09-26|website=Evening Standard|language=en|access-date=2019-10-01}}</ref>
*[[David Miliband|David]] and [[Ed Miliband]] were selected to fight safe Labour seats in [[northern England]], [[South Shields (UK Parliament constituency)|South Shields]] and [[Doncaster North]] respectively, despite being [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] graduates who were born, raised, and living in London whilst working as political advisers. Both would later serve as cabinet ministers and fight against each other in the [[2010 Labour Party leadership election (UK)|2010 party leadership election]].
*[[Douglas Carswell]] defected from the Conservatives to the [[UK Independence Party]] in 2014, in turn displacing the existing UKIP candidate in his constituency of [[Clacton (UK Parliament constituency)|Clacton]].

*[[George Galloway]] was expelled from Labour in 2003 and, despite previously representing [[Glasgow Kelvin (UK Parliament constituency)|Glasgow Kelvin]], did not contest a Glasgow seat in 2005. Instead, he stood for the [[Respect Party]] in the Greater London constituency of [[Bethnal Green and Bow (UK Parliament constituency)|Bethnal Green and Bow]], where he used his opposition to the [[Iraq War]] and the local Muslim population to gain the seat from Labour. [[Tottenham (UK Parliament constituency)|Tottenham]] MP and Constitutional Affairs Minister [[David Lammy]] said he was a carpetbagger who had whipped up racial tensions.<ref>{{cite AV media|title=BBC Election 2005|date=5 May 2005|last=Lammy|first=David|time=6:57:50|quote=I think he's a carpetbagger who came down from Scotland to whip up racial tensions in Tower Hamlets.}}</ref> After standing down from Bethnal Green and Bow in 2010, he had a two-year hiatus from parliament.
