==Background==
On September 28, 2016, it was announced that [[Jon Favreau]] would direct a remake of Disney's ''[[The Lion King]]'', which was announced to feature songs from the original film by [[Elton John]] and [[Tim Rice]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Disney and Jon Favreau Joining Forces on "The Lion King"|url=https://thewaltdisneycompany.com/disney-jon-favreau-the-lion-king/|accessdate=September 28, 2016|work=The Walt Disney Company|date=September 28, 2016}}</ref> On November 1, 2017, it was announced that the original film's composer, [[Hans Zimmer]], who composed additional music for Favreau's ''[[Iron Man (2008 film)|Iron Man]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hans-zimmer.com/index.php?rub=disco&id=783|title=Hans-Zimmer.com - Iron Man|website=www.hans-zimmer.com}}</ref> would return to score the film.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://screenrant.com/disney-lion-king-hans-zimmer-composer/ | title= Hans Zimmer Set to Score Disney's Live-Action The Lion King | first=Cooper | last=Hood | date=November 1, 2017 | publisher=[[Screen Rant]] | accessdate=February 3, 2018}}</ref> Zimmer initially hesitated to return for the remake, arguing that "[he has] worked very hard to not ruin things through improvement", however, he agreed to compose the remake after performing the original film's score in a concert, saying that he "suddenly realized what [his] place in this new version was: to try a big experiment and use my band and orchestra, go back to Africa, work with [[Lebo M.|Lebo]] and the chorus and extraordinary musicians from all over the world, and really make this a ''performance''".<ref name="EW">{{cite web | url=https://ew.com/movies/2019/04/25/the-lion-king-cover-story/ | title= The Lion King: EW visits the set of Disney's rule-breaking beast of a remake | first=Marc | last=Snetiker | date=April 25, 2019 | publisher=[[Entertainment Weekly]] | accessdate=February 3, 2018}}</ref> Zimmer treated his work on the remake similar to his work on the original film, stating that "[He is] doing this strictly for the people for whom it means something. [He is] working [his] musicians to the bone because [he] wants to get that performance. [He wanted] to smell sweat and blood in [the] studio".<ref name="EW"/> However, he also had a different approach on the score than in the original film, trying to "rehearse and record the score like a live concert performance".<ref name="Soundtrack"/>

On November 28, 2017, it was reported that [[Elton John]] had signed onto the project to rework his musical compositions from the original film before retiring.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/gossip/confidential/elton-john-set-rake-article-1.3660427|title=Elton John will make millions with live-action remake of ''The Lion King''|work=[[New York Daily News]]|date=November 28, 2017|accessdate=November 28, 2017}}</ref> The following day, it was reported that Beyoncé would assist John in the soundtrack's re-work.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nme.com/news/film/beyonce-elton-john-lion-king-songs-recording-report-2166304|title=Beyoncé and Elton John were reportedly working on new versions of ''The Lion King'' songs|work=[[NME]]|date=November 29, 2017|accessdate=December 5, 2017}}</ref> On February 18, 2018, it was reported that four songs from the original film would be included: "[[Circle of Life]]", "[[I Just Can't Wait to Be King]]", "[[Hakuna Matata (song)|Hakuna Matata]]", and "[[Can You Feel the Love Tonight]]",<ref>{{cite news|url=https://collider.com/the-lion-king-remake-soundtrack-tim-rice/|title=''The Lion King'': Live-Action Remake Will Only Use Four Songs from the Original's Soundtrack|last=Cabin|first=Chris|date=February 18, 2018|work=[[Collider (website)|Collider]]|accessdate=February 18, 2018}}</ref> the latter being performed by Beyoncé, [[Donald Glover]], [[Seth Rogen]], and [[Billy Eichner]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/film-tv/a26025999/beyonce-lion-king-can-you-feel-the-love-tonight/|title=Beyoncé Is Singing "Can You Feel the Love Tonight" in the Lion King Remake|first=Erica|last=Gonzales|work=Harper Bazzar|date=January 24, 2019|accessdate=February 25, 2019}}</ref> On February 3, 2019, it was reported that "[[Be Prepared (Disney song)|Be Prepared]]" would be featured in the film as well.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.broadwayworld.com/article/Be-Prepared-Will-Be-Featured-in-THE-LION-KING-Live-Action-Film-20190203|title='Be Prepared' Will Be Featured in THE LION KING Live Action Film|first=Stephanie|last=Wild|work=BroadwayWorld|date=February 3, 2019|accessdate=February 3, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://ew.com/movies/2019/04/29/the-lion-king-scar/|title=The Lion King's Chiwetel Ejiofor on the diabolical psychology of Scar|first=Marc|last=Snetiker|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=April 29, 2019|accessdate=April 30, 2019}}</ref> Favreau described the experience of "not trying to create new songs but trying to build on what people remember and love about the old ones" as something "really fun and formative".<ref name="EW"/> The score and the songs in the remake were influenced by the music featured in the [[The Lion King (musical)|Broadway version of ''The Lion King'']], as Favreau felt that "[Zimmer and John] really [explored] further what the roots of the music are [in the Broadway show]".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://screenrant.com/lion-king-2019-broadway-play-inspiration-music-favreau|title=The Lion King Remake Took Inspiration From the Broadway Play|first=Joe|last=Deckelmeier|work=[[Screen Rant]]|date=May 31, 2019|accessdate=June 6, 2019}}</ref>

Of the five songs of the original, the fate of "Be Prepared" was the one which was most debated when creating the film's soundtrack. Favreau felt that the original sequence, which he compared to the ''[[Night on Bald Mountain]]'' segment of ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]'', would clash too heavily with the remake's tone and characterization of Scar. Favreau considered outright cutting the song and had screenwriter Jeff Nathanson create a spoken word monologue to replace the song, but was unsatisfied since he knew how important a villain song is to a Disney film. He asked Zimmer if any sort of musical version of the song could still be a part of the film; Favreau subsequently asked [[Tim Rice]] if he could update the song's lyrics to reflect Scar's new dynamic with the hyenas. Rice did so, and the final version of the song is a mix of the monologue Nathanson penned (from "Mufasa has always shown too much restraint when it comes to hunting" to "the need for a diff'rnt dream"), Rice's old and new lyrics, and new score created by Zimmer. Favreau opined that while it wasn't the full song, it would give the audiences the impression that they had still seen the sequence in the remake, and cited the final shot of Scar on a peak with a crescent moon behind him as a key image he had to keep for the film.<ref name="Director's commentary">Jon Favreau: ''The Lion King'', audio commentary to the Blu-ray version of the film</ref>

On February 9, 2018, John revealed that he, Rice and Beyoncé would create a new song for the film's end credits.<ref name="JohnRiceBeyoncé">{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/movies/the-lion-king/news/a849649/disney-lion-king-remake-sir-elton-john-tim-rice-beyonce-collaboration/|title=Sir Elton John confirms new Tim Rice collaboration for Disney's ''The Lion King'' remake|work=[[Digital Spy]]|date=February 10, 2018|accessdate=February 11, 2018}}</ref> However, the collaboration between John and Beyoncé did not pan out as their unreleased song was not added to the official soundtrack.<ref>https://www.thewrap.com/the-lion-king-elton-john-song-end-credits-never-too-late/</ref> John and Rice wrote a new song for the end credits, titled "Never Too Late" and performed by John.<ref name="Soundtrack">{{cite web|url=https://collider.com/the-lion-king-soundtrack-details-new-song|title='The Lion King' Soundtrack Details Revealed; Includes New Elton John Song|first=Adam|last=Chitwood|work=[[Collider (website)|Collider]]|date=June 24, 2019|accessdate=June 24, 2019}}</ref>

The film also features a cover of [[The Tokens]]' "[[The Lion Sleeps Tonight]]", performed by Rogen and Eichner,<ref name="Soundtrack"/> as well as the song "[[He Lives in You]]" from ''[[Rhythm of the Pride Lands]]'' and the Broadway production, performed by Lebo M.<ref name="Soundtrack"/> [[Pharrell Williams]] would produce five songs for the film.<ref name="Soundtrack"/> The soundtrack, featuring Zimmer's score and the film's various existing and new songs, was released digitally on July 11, 2019, and physically on July 19, 2019.<ref name="Soundtrack"/>

In October 2019, John heavily criticized the soundtrack, saying in full, "The new version of ''The Lion King'' was a huge disappointment to me, because I believe they messed the music up. Music was so much a part of the original and the music in the current film didn't have the same impact. The magic and joy were lost. The soundtrack hasn't had nearly the same impact in the charts that it had 25 years ago, when it was the bestselling album of the year. The new soundtrack fell out of the charts so quickly, despite the massive box-office success. I wish I'd been invited to the party more, but the creative vision for the film and its music was different this time around and I wasn't really welcomed or treated with the same level of respect. That makes me extremely sad. I'm so happy that the right spirit for the music lives on with the ''Lion King'' stage musical."<ref>https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/culture/article/elton-john-interview</ref>
