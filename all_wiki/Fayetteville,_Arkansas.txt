'''Fayetteville''' is the [[List of cities and towns in Arkansas|third-largest city]] in [[Arkansas]] and [[county seat]] of [[Washington County, Arkansas|Washington County]].  The city is on the outskirts of the [[Boston Mountains]], deep within the [[Ozarks]].  Known as '''Washington''' until 1829, the city was named after [[Fayetteville, Tennessee]], from which many of the settlers had come.  It was incorporated on November 3, 1836 and was rechartered in 1867.  The four-county [[Fayetteville-Springdale-Rogers Metropolitan Area|Northwest Arkansas Metropolitan Statistical Area]] is ranked 105th in terms of population in the [[United States]] with 463,204 in 2010 according to the [[United States Census Bureau]].  The city had a population of 73,580 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 Census]].<ref name="eoa">{{cite encyclopedia|last=Stewart|first=Charles W.|title=Fayetteville (Washington County)|url=http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?entryID=1006|encyclopedia=[[Encyclopedia of Arkansas History and Culture]]|publisher=[[Butler Center for Arkansas Studies]] at the [[Central Arkansas Library System]]|date=March 1, 2012|access-date=July 20, 2013|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515093854/http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?entryID=1006|archive-date=May 15, 2013}}</ref>

==History==

===Settlement through Antebellum period===
[[File:Fayetteville, Arkansas circa 1887.jpg|left|thumb|Fayetteville, {{c.}} 1887]]
In 1828, George McGarrah settled at Big Spring with his family on the modern day corner of Spring and Willow, founding the town of Washington, and starting work on the courthouse. On October 17, Washington County was established, Washington chosen as the county seat. The Washington Courthouse was finished in 1829, and also contained the post office. Later in the year Postmaster Larkin Newton changed the name to the Fayetteville Courthouse, to avoid confusing with [[Washington, Arkansas|Washington]], [[Hempstead County, Arkansas|Hempstead County]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Adison|first1=Charlie|title=Timeline — 1820s|url=http://www.fayettevillehistory.org/1820s/|website=Fayetteville History|access-date=August 25, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305221856/http://www.fayettevillehistory.org/1820s/|archive-date=March 5, 2016|quote=Because of confusion arising from another Arkansas town in Hempstead County already being named Washington, the postmaster general orders Washington Courthouse to be renamed.}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book | last = Deane | first = Ernie | author-link = Ernie Deane | title = Arkansas Place Names | publisher = The Ozarks Mountaineer | year = 1986 | location = Branson, Missouri | page = 83 | oclc = 14961821 }}</ref> Two councilmen selected to name the city were from [[Fayetteville, Tennessee]], which was itself named for [[Fayetteville, North Carolina|Fayetteville]], [[North Carolina]] (where some of its earliest residents had lived before moving to Tennessee).  That original Fayetteville was named for [[Gilbert du Motier, marquis de Lafayette|General Lafayette]], a [[France|French]] general who helped the colonies gain independence in the [[American Revolutionary War]].

The first store in Fayetteville was opened by John Nye in a small building constructed by James Holmsley. In 1832 David Walker, Chief Justice of the Arkansas supreme court, built a double log cabin on what is now Center Street. In 1822 [[Archibald Yell]], the second Governor of Arkansas, built a house and called it "Waxhaw" after his home in [[North Carolina]]. This was on the outskirts of town then but now is a street named after him that connects College and School streets. The first hotels were the Burnside House and the Onstott House. Fayetteville was incorporated as a town on November 3, 1836.

In 1859, a city charter was obtained from the Legislature. During the Civil War the municipal government was suspended and was not reinstated until 1867. P.V. Rhea was the president of the town trustees in 1836; J.W. Walker was the first mayor under the charter of 1859, and M.L. Harrison was the first mayor when the government was reorganized in 1867. The [[telegraph]] came to Fayetteville in 1860, strung along the [[Old Wire Road|Military Road]] from [[St. Louis, Missouri]] to [[Little Rock, Arkansas|Little Rock]].<ref name="fh86">{{cite web|last1=Adison|first1=Charlie|title=Timeline — 1860s|url=http://fayettevillehistory.typepad.com/main//1860s/|website=fayettevillehistory.org|access-date=August 25, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090209215147/http://fayettevillehistory.typepad.com/main/1860s/|archive-date=February 9, 2009|quote=First telegraph line is strung by the Stebbins Telegraph Co. from Jefferson City along the old military road, through Fayetteville and into Fort Smith.}}</ref>

Newspapers were established early; in 1859, [[Elias Cornelius Boudinot]], a young half-[[Cherokee]] attorney, and James Pettigrew founded ''The Arkansan.'' The ''Fayetteville Weekly Democrat'' began publishing in 1868. It later developed as the ''[[Northwest Arkansas Times]]'', and is still in print today. The [[Fayetteville Public Schools|Fayetteville Schools District]] was founded on March 20, 1871 as the first independent school district in Arkansas. The public school system was established by the [[Reconstruction era (United States)|Reconstruction era]] legislature; before the war, all education was private. Arkansas had struggled with [[History of Arkansas#Banking crisis|a state banking crisis]], resulting in the illegality of banking until 1868. Following the reinstatement, the Stark Bank became the first bank in the state in 1872, becoming the William McIlroy Bank four years later. This institution remains today as [[Arvest Bank]].

===School integration===

===Topography===
[[File:OzarkRelief.jpg|left|thumb|The split between the [[Ozarks#Physiographic subregions|Springfield Plateau]] and the [[Boston Mountains]] occurs in the center of [[Washington County, Arkansas]] very near Fayetteville. The rough, mountainous terrain south of Fayetteville is the Boston Mountains while the more-habitable Springfield Plateau contains the cities of [[Springdale, Arkansas|Springdale]], [[Bentonville, Arkansas|Bentonville]] and [[Rogers, Arkansas|Rogers]] to the north.]]
Fayetteville is located in the [[Boston Mountains]], a subset of [[The Ozarks]] which run through Northwest Arkansas, southern [[Missouri]], and [[Eastern Oklahoma]].<ref>{{ cite journal |last= Branner |first= George C. |title= Mineral Resources of Benton, Carroll, Madison, and Washington Counties |publisher= Arkansas State Geologist |year= 1984 |location= Little Rock, Arkansas |orig-year=1940 |journal= County Mineral Report 2 |page= 2 }}</ref> The rocks of the Boston Mountains were formed when [[sandstone]]s and [[shale]]s were deposited on top of the Springfield Plateau during the [[Pennsylvanian (geology)|Pennsylvanian]] Period. In the Fayetteville area, following uplift during the [[Ouachita orogeny]], the sediments were eroded to expose the [[Mississippian age|Mississippian]] [[limestone]] formations of the Springfield Plateau, while south of Fayetteville the remaining deeply eroded Pennsylvanian sediments form the steep Boston Mountains.

Fayetteville is also the namesake of the [[Fayetteville Shale]], a [[geology|geological]] [[Formation (stratigraphy)|formation]] which has recently become an epicenter for natural gas extraction by [[hydraulic fracturing]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Fayetteville Shale: Map, News, Video |publisher=geology.com |url=http://geology.com/articles/fayetteville-shale.shtml |access-date=July 24, 2011 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711113300/http://geology.com/articles/fayetteville-shale.shtml |archive-date=July 11, 2011 }}</ref>

[[File:Mount Sequoyah and Fayetteville from University of Arkansas.jpg|right|thumb|Mount Sequoyah rises above Fayetteville on the city's eastern side]]
Fayetteville is entirely contained within [[Fayetteville Township, Washington County, Arkansas|Fayetteville Township]], as the township and city have identical boundaries. Although Arkansas generally does not use its [[civil township]]s for any governmental purpose, they are used for voting boundaries in some places.

Generally the part of Fayetteville west of I-49/US 71 is called west Fayetteville. Another prominent district is Uptown Fayetteville, which encompasses the scores of business and new homes near the [[Northwest Arkansas Mall]] in north Fayetteville. The [[University of Arkansas]] defines its own part of Fayetteville, with dozens of student apartments and restaurants located near [[University of Arkansas Campus Historic District|campus]]. The University's impact is also apparent along [[Arkansas Highway 471|College Avenue]], which contains hundreds of shops and restaurants. Northeast of campus are the [[Wilson Park Historic District]] and the [[Mount Nord Historic District]]. The [[Fayetteville Historic Square]] is the original city center of Fayetteville, and [[Dickson Street]] is the best-known entertainment district in Arkansas. Homes atop Mount Sequoyah in the eastern part of the city encircle Mount Sequoyah Retreat and Conference Center. Old structures are also located along the former [[Butterfield Overland Mail]] route, a stagecoach route to [[San Francisco, California]] now known as [[Old Wire Road]]. [[Arkansas Highway 16|Fifteenth Street]] forms the southernmost residential district of Fayetteville, with the Fayetteville Industrial Park to its east.

====Annexed communities====
Fayetteville has annexed six [[unincorporated area|unincorporated communities]] within its current corporate limits. Four of them are still listed as "populated places" by the [[USGS]] [[United States Board on Geographic Names|Board on Geographic Names]]. The other 2 are listed as "historical populated places." Annexations since 1870 are displayed on Fayetteville's website in the interactive maps section.<ref name="records">{{cite web|title=Land Records|url=http://gis.fayetteville-ar.gov/GISPage/LandRecords/|website=gis.fayetteville-ar.gov|access-date=August 24, 2016|ref=records|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160825175751/http://gis.fayetteville-ar.gov/GISPage/LandRecords/|archive-date=August 25, 2016}}</ref> Fayetteville's second annexations took place in 1946 when it incorporated [[Fayette Junction, Arkansas|Fayette Junction]] and [[McNair, Arkansas|McNair]] into the city.<ref name="records"/><ref>{{cite web|title=McNair, Fayetteville, Fayetteville Township, Washington County, Arkansas, United States - Overview - Histopolis|url=http://www.histopolis.com/Place/US/AR/Washington_County/McNair|website=www.histopolis.com|access-date=August 24, 2016|date=January 12, 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160826100454/http://www.histopolis.com/Place/US/AR/Washington_County/McNair|archive-date=August 26, 2016}}</ref> [[Baldwin, Arkansas|Baldwin]] was added the following year, with [[Barbara, Arkansas|Barbara]] and [[Ruckers Grove, Arkansas|Ruckers Grove]] being annexed in 1967. Fayetteville's most recent annexation occurred in 1982 when [[White Rock, Washington County, Arkansas|White Rock]] was added to the city limits.

===Climate===
Fayetteville has a [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Cfa'').  Fayetteville experiences all four seasons and does receive cold air masses from the north; however, some of the Arctic masses are blocked by the higher elevations of the Ozarks.

August is the hottest month of the year, with an average high of {{convert|89.2|°F|1}} and an average low of {{convert|67.8|°F|1}}. Temperatures above {{convert|100|°F}} are rare but do occur, on average, twice a year. January is the coldest month with an average high of {{convert|46.4|°F|1}} and an average low of {{convert|26.3|°F|1}}. Highs below {{convert|32|°F}} occur on average thirteen times a year, with 2.2 nights per year dropping below {{convert|0|°F}}. The city's highest temperature was {{convert|111|°F|1}}, recorded on July 14, 1954. The lowest temperature recorded was {{convert|-24|°F}}, on February 12, 1899.

Precipitation is weakly seasonal, with a bimodal pattern: wet seasons in the spring and fall, and relatively drier summers and winters, but some rain in all months.  The spring wet season is more pronounced than fall, with the highest rainfall in May.  This differs slightly from the climate in central Arkansas, where the fall wet season is more comparable to spring.

The University of Arkansas has also been changing into a research-centered university since the late-20th century.

==Culture, contemporary life, and points of interest==
[[File:Fayetteville skyline from Old Main lawn.jpg|thumb|Downtown Fayetteville as seen from Old Main Lawn]]
{{See also|Culture of Arkansas}}
Fayetteville's culture is a combination of a Southern city, college town, and the surrounding Northwest Arkansas metro.

Fayetteville shares many of the characteristics commonly given to Arkansas as a Southern state, yet it has also absorbed cultural influence from the Mid and South West. Located in the mid-South, Fayetteville's culture is distinct and it differs from the southeastern portion of the state and other [[Southeastern Conference]] college towns, areas more commonly associated with the [[Deep South]]. Many of the city's first settlers came from Mid South states like [[Kentucky]] and [[Tennessee]], who found the Ozarks familiar to the [[Appalachian Mountains]] back home.<ref>Arnold et al 2002, p. 104.</ref> The uplands of Arkansas, including the Fayetteville area, did not participate in large-scale plantation farming with slaves like the [[Arkansas Delta]], instead electing to settle in small clusters, relying largely on [[subsistence agriculture]] and hunting rather than the settlement patterns common in the [[Midwest]] and Deep South. The "hillbilly" stereotype given to the Ozarks and Appalachians is largely a derivative of the difficult topography, poor quality or lack of formal education, and mostly cashless self-sustaining economy found in those regions. Fayetteville's large proportion of [[Southern Baptist]] and [[Methodist]] adherents reflect the trend often associated with the Deep South.<ref>{{cite web |title= Arkansas's Regional Identity |url= http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?entryID=5857 |date= June 7, 2013 |first= Guy |last= Lancaster |access-date= August 18, 2013 |url-status= live |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130405060126/http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?entryID=5857 |archive-date= April 5, 2013 }}</ref>

[[File:Sunset in Fayetteville.jpg|thumb|Sunset seen from Dickson Street, with Old Main on the horizon]]
The city also derives a cultural identity from the University of Arkansas, exhibiting many trademarks of a college town such as a prominent arts and music scene, emphasis on local businesses, college-oriented bar/restaurant entertainment district, progressive residents and a focus on environmental sustainability.<ref>{{cite magazine |first= Stirling |last= Kelso |title= The South's Best College Towns |magazine= [[Southern Living]] |url= http://www.southernliving.com/travel/best-college-towns-00417000074763/page18.html |access-date= August 18, 2013 |url-status= live |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120119115622/http://www.southernliving.com/travel/best-college-towns-00417000074763/page18.html |archive-date= January 19, 2012 }}</ref> Fayetteville also shares a passion for collegiate athletics similar to many other Southeastern Conference member institution cities, such as [[Oxford, Mississippi]] and [[College Station, Texas]], earning a #15 ranking on ''Forbes''' "Top College Sports Towns" list.<ref>{{cite news |title= 7.

Fayetteville has a strong BBQ tradition, earning a #9 ranking on the "Top 10 Best BBQ Cities" by ''Livability''. The majority of Fayetteville's restaurants serve [[Memphis-style barbecue]], with some [[Texas-style barbecue|Texas]] influence. The [[Bikes Blues and BBQ]] motorcycle rally places an emphasis on the city's BBQ heritage, despite having little BBQ or Blues focus in the festival itself, and [[white nationalist]] paraphernalia for sale.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://arktimes.com/columns/autumn-tolbert/2019/09/28/bikes-blues-and-nazi-merchandise|title=Bikes, Blues and Nazi merchandise|last=Tolbert|first=Autumn|date=2019-09-28|website=Arkansas Times|language=en-US|access-date=2019-09-29}}</ref>

During the last decade, the university has drawn a large influx of students from bordering states, largely due to the New Arkansan Non-Resident Tuition Award scholarship program. As of Spring 2018, nearly 40% of the student population is made up of students hailing from outside of Arkansas.<ref>https://oir.uark.edu/students/enrollment-reports/spring2018enrlrptsummaryv2.pdf</ref> As a result, student-centered off campus apartments communities are being rapidly built to accommodate the growing student population.

{{Main|Dickson Street|Walton Arts Center}}
Dickson Street is the primary entertainment district in the region, including musical and stage performances, shopping, bars and restaurants. The [[West Dickson Street Commercial Historic District]] includes several blocks along its namesake street as well as a few blocks of West Avenue lined with unique shops, restaurants and bars. Adjacent to the University of Arkansas campus, several of Dickson Street's establishments cater to students. The district has been enjoying a rejuvenation began in the 1980s by Dickson Street merchants who had watched the street turn into a dilapidated, crime-filled area. Many businesses had relocated onto College Avenue, leaving Dickson Street empty and in disrepair. The improvements lured the [[Walton Arts Center]], today Arkansas' premier center for arts and entertainment, to locate on Dickson Street, a decision that proved beneficial to both parties.<ref>{{cite web|title=Walton Arts Center: Mission and History |publisher=Walton Arts Center |url=http://www.waltonartscenter.org/aboutus/missionandhistory.aspx |access-date=July 23, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718221549/http://www.waltonartscenter.org/aboutus/missionandhistory.aspx |archive-date=July 18, 2011 }}</ref>

The center is the result of a joint effort between the City of Fayetteville and the University of Arkansas to bring arts to the city. The center is located on [[Dickson Street]] halfway between the University and the [[Fayetteville Historic Square|town square]]. It currently features a full [[Broadway theatre]] season, arts camps, continuing education opportunities for teachers of the arts, University-sponsored performances in addition to serving as a host for community events. A considerable donation from the namesake [[Sam Walton|Walton family]] assisted greatly in the construction of the building.

[[TheatreSquared]], Northwest Arkansas's only year-round professional regional theatre, is located just off Dickson Street, with an annual audience of 40,000 patrons including 18,500 students reached through outreach programs. The theatre was recognized in 2011 by the [[American Theatre Wing]] as one of the nation's ten most promising emerging theatres.<ref>{{cite web |title= American Theatre Wing Recognizes 2011 National Theatre Company Grant Winners |publisher=TheaterManie |url=http://www.theatermania.com/new-york-city/news/10-2011/american-theatre-wing-announces-2011-national-thea_41779.html |access-date=February 12, 2012}}</ref> Dickson Street is also home to George's Majestic Lounge, the oldest live music venue in Arkansas and one of the oldest bar and concert venues in the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]].

The major through route in Fayetteville is [[Interstate 49]]/[[U.S. Route 71 in Arkansas|US 71]]. This [[Controlled-access highway|fully controlled access]], four-lane [[Controlled-access highway|expressway]] is a discontinuous piece of a route ultimately planned to connect [[Kansas City, Missouri]] to [[New Orleans, Louisiana]]. Formerly designated as [[Interstate 540 (Arkansas)|Interstate 540]] with the re-designation as Interstate 49 being granted by the U S Department of Transportation Federal Highway Administration on March 28, 2014,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.arkansashighways.com/forums/I-49-approval-north.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=May 26, 2014 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140527215757/http://www.arkansashighways.com/forums/I-49-approval-north.pdf |archive-date=May 27, 2014 }}</ref> the highway became the first freeway in the area when it was completed in the 1990s to relieve the former US 71 (now [[Arkansas Highway 471|US 71B]]) of a much-increased demand of through travelers following the unanticipated and rapid growth of the [[Fayetteville–Springdale–Rogers Metropolitan Area|Northwest Arkansas metro]]. Future plans for the I-49 corridor include completion of a freeway segment through [[Western Arkansas]] to Texarkana and completion of a [[Bella Vista Bypass]] to the north.

Other major north–south routes in Fayetteville include [[Arkansas Highway 471|US 71B]], which was the predecessor to I-49/US 71. This route is now mostly designated College Avenue in Fayetteville and features dozens of restaurants and stores, with many aimed at the [[University of Arkansas]] student demographic. To the east of College Avenue is the oldest road in Fayetteville, [[Arkansas Highway 265]]. This route first was used by [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] as the [[Great Osage Trail]], followed by [[American Civil War|Civil War]] troops bound for [[Fort Smith, Arkansas]], the [[Trail of Tears]], the [[Butterfield Overland Mail]] stagecoach route, and later still the [[telegraph]]. To the west of College Avenue is [[Gregg Avenue]], which contains many student-oriented apartments along its shoulders and further west is [[Arkansas Highway 112|Garland Avenue]]. This route runs along the [[campus of the University of Arkansas]] in south Fayetteville, with apartments and duplexes along its northern routing.

====Public transportation====
The city of Fayetteville has two major providers of public transportation. [[Razorback Transit]] is a free bus system centered on the [[campus of the University of Arkansas]] with routes to other Fayetteville destinations such as [[Dickson Street]] or the [[Northwest Arkansas Mall]]. [[Ozark Regional Transit]] runs throughout both Washington and [[Benton County, Arkansas|Benton Counties]] and is a broader bus-based regional transit system.

====Aviation====
[[Drake Field]], formerly Fayetteville Municipal Airport, is owned by the city and serves [[general aviation]].  The nearest airport for commercial flights is [[Northwest Arkansas Regional Airport]] (XNA), located 17 miles northwest of the city, which opened in 1998.

===Utilities===
[[File:Fayetteville flushing hydrant.jpg|right|thumb|City crew [[Fire hydrant#Inspection and maintenance|flushing]] a fire hydrant in Uptown Fayetteville]]
The City of Fayetteville owns and operates a large water system that provides services to several municipalities and unincorporated areas in the northern half of Washington County in addition to Fayetteville residents. Drinking water is pumped in from the [[Beaver Lake (Arkansas)|Beaver Water District]] treatment plant in [[Lowell, Arkansas|Lowell]].<ref>{{cite web |title= Election Day Will Decide Two Positions for Beaver Water District |url= http://5newsonline.com/2012/11/03/election-day-will-decide-two-positions-for-beaver-water-district/ |publisher= [[KFSM-TV]] |date= November 3, 2012 |last= Pruna |first= Jocelyne |access-date= January 13, 2013 |url-status= live |archive-url= http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20130113230417/http://5newsonline.com/2012/11/03/election-day-will-decide-two-positions-for-beaver-water-district/ |archive-date= January 13, 2013 }}</ref> The city uses {{convert|16|MUSgal|ML}} of water per day on average.<ref>{{cite web|title=Utilities Department |url=http://www.accessfayetteville.org/government/utilities_department/index.cfm |publisher=City of Fayetteville |access-date=August 18, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110817050911/http://www.accessfayetteville.org/government/utilities_department/index.cfm |archive-date=August 17, 2011 }}</ref>

====Wastewater====
Fayetteville owns its own [[wastewater]] operation, including a network of pipes and lift stations which convey wastewater to the city's two wastewater treatment plants. Both plants are operated by [[CH2M Hill|CH2M]] and regulated by the [[Arkansas Department of Environmental Quality]] (ADEQ). Historically, all sewage was sent to the Paul R. Noland Wastewater Treatment Plant (Noland WWTP) on the east side of town. However, development on the city's west side as well as the expense of pumping wastewater over East Mountain led the city to build the West Side WWTP in 2008. In addition to these two facilities, Fayetteville also operates 39 lift stations to pump wastewater over steep elevation rises in order to utilize gravity flow toward the WWTPs. Fayetteville also maintains a [[biosolids]] management program, in which biosolids, a byproduct of [[Sewage treatment|wastewater treatment]], are land applied to provide nutrients to soil on which crops are grown.

Fayetteville's first wastewater treatment came in 1913 in the form of an [[Imhoff tank]] on the West Fork of the White River.<ref>{{cite web|title=Wastewater Treatment History |publisher=City of Fayetteville |url=http://www.accessfayetteville.org/government/wastewater/misc/index.cfm |access-date=January 20, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201175612/http://www.accessfayetteville.org/government/wastewater/misc/index.cfm |archive-date=February 1, 2014 }}</ref> This facility was improved several times throughout the years until the construction of the City of Fayetteville Water Pollution Control Facility downstream of [[Lake Sequoyah (Arkansas)|Lake Sequoyah]]. This plant was built in 1968 and has since seen major upgrades and expansion. Now known as the Noland WWTP, it is designed for a flow rate of {{convert|12.6|MUSgal|ML}} per day.<ref>{{ cite report |title= Paul R.

The city's biosolids program was conceived after concerns about the costs and sustainability of landfill dumping arose. Fayetteville initiated a land application program on a farm site near the Noland plant that allowed the city to apply biosolids and subsequently grow and harvest hay. In 2010, solar energy became the main component of the solids dewatering process following the installation of six [[solar dryer]]s.<ref>{{ cite report |title= Biosolids Management Construction Permit |work= Final State Construction Permit |publisher= City of Fayetteville, Arkansas Department of Environmental Quality |url= http://www.adeq.state.ar.us/ftproot/Pub/WebDatabases/PermitsOnline/NPDES/Permits/AR0020010C.pdf |date= May 2010 |access-date= January 20, 2013 |url-status= live |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140203044551/http://www.adeq.state.ar.us/ftproot/Pub/WebDatabases/PermitsOnline/NPDES/Permits/AR0020010C.pdf |archive-date= February 3, 2014 }}</ref> From this program, the city gains additional revenue from the sale of hay and fertilizer (Class A biosolids).<ref>{{cite web |title= Fayetteville: Reducing Waste, Space, Means Profit |date= December 10, 2012 |url= http://www.arkansasbusiness.com/article/89497/fayetteville-reducing-waste-space-means-profit-green-initiatives-winner-20000?page=all |publisher= Arkansas Business |work= Green Initiatives |access-date= January 20, 2014 |url-status= live |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140201183320/http://www.arkansasbusiness.com/article/89497/fayetteville-reducing-waste-space-means-profit-green-initiatives-winner-20000?page=all |archive-date= February 1, 2014 }}</ref>
