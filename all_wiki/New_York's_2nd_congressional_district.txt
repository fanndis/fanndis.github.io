===1805–1809: Two seats on general ticket with 3rd district ===

[[Gurdon S. Mumford]] is usually{{by whom|date=September 2013}} listed as member from the 2nd district, and [[George Clinton Jr.]] from the 3rd district, because Clinton was elected to fill the vacancy caused by the election of Mitchill to the U.S. Senate, and Mitchill had been elected previously in the 3rd district. However, in 1804 Mitchill [[1804 United States House of Representatives elections in New York|was already re-elected]] on the 2nd/3rd general ticket, and both Clinton and Mumford were elected in special elections, receiving votes in both districts.
