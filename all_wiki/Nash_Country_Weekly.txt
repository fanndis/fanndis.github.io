In February 2009, ''Country Weekly'' reverted to a weekly magazine, having been issued [[fortnight]]ly since 1999. The magazine also dropped subscriptions at that point (which it later reinstated), and changed its logo.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://adage.com/mediaworks/article?article_id=133716&search_phrase=country%20weekly|title=Country Weekly Drops Subscriptions for Newsstand Sales Only|last=Ives|first=Nat|date=January 12, 2009|work=Ad Age|accessdate=January 14, 2009|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/69tMnnGql?url=http://adage.com/article/media/country-weekly-drops-subscriptions-newsstand-sales/133716/|archive-date=August 13, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> [[Cumulus Media]] acquired ''Country Weekly'' in 2014.<ref>[https://www.allaccess.com/net-news/archive/story/152615/nash-country-weekly-shifting-to-digital-only-relau 'Nash Country Weekly' Shifting To Digital Only, Relaunching As Daily Content Provider]</ref> The magazine was renamed ''Nash Country Weekly'' in June 2015, as a means of co-branding with [[Nash FM]].<ref>[http://www.countryweekly.com/news/country-weekly-changes-name-nash-country-weekly “Country Weekly” Changes Name to “Nash Country Weekly”] June 5, 2015.
