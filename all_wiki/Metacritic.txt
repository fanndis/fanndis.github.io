'''Metacritic''' is a website that [[aggregates reviews]] of films, TV shows, music albums, video games and formerly, books. For each product, the scores from each review are averaged  (a [[weighted average]]). Metacritic was created by Jason Dietz, Marc Doyle, and Julie Doyle Roberts in 1999. The site provides an excerpt from each review and hyperlinks to its source. A color of green, yellow or red summarizes the critics' recommendations. It is regarded as the foremost online review aggregation site for the video game industry.<ref name="gamerevolution.com">{{Cite web |last=Leack |first=Jonathan |date=September 25, 2015 |title=OpenCritic's Gamer-Centric Style Is Everything Metacritic Should Have Been |url=http://www.gamerevolution.com/features/opencritics-gamercentric-style-is-everything-metacritic-should-have-been |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150927012222/http://www.gamerevolution.com/features/opencritics-gamercentric-style-is-everything-metacritic-should-have-been |archive-date=September 27, 2015 |access-date=September 12, 2019 |website=[[Game Revolution]]}}</ref><ref name="Mike Rose">{{Cite web |last=Rose |first=Mike |date=July 10, 2012 |title=Metacritic is here to stay, but can we fix it? |url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/173879/Metacritic_is_here_to_stay_but_can_we_fix_it.php |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180915161414/http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/173879/Metacritic_is_here_to_stay_but_can_we_fix_it.php |archive-date=September 15, 2018 |access-date=September 12, 2019 |website=[[Gamasutra]]}}</ref>

Metacritic's scoring converts each review into a percentage, either mathematically from the mark given, or what the site decides subjectively from a qualitative review.  Before being averaged, the scores are weighted according to the critic's fame, stature, and volume of reviews. The website won two [[Webby Award]]s for excellence as an aggregation website. Criticism has focused on the assessment system, the assignment of scores to reviews that do not include ratings, alleged third-party attempts to influence the scores, and lack of staff oversight of user reviews.

== History ==
[[File:Metacritic logo original.svg|thumb|right|upright=0.7|The original logo for Metacritic]]
Metacritic was launched in January 2001<ref>{{Cite web |title=Metacritic: The History |url=https://www.metacritic.com/about-metacritic |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180905084507/http://www.metacritic.com/about-metacritic |archive-date=September 5, 2018 |access-date=September 5, 2018 |website=Metacritic |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]}}</ref> by Marc Doyle, his sister Julie Doyle Roberts, and a classmate from the [[University of Southern California]] law school, Jason Dietz, after two years of developing the site. [[Rotten Tomatoes]] was already compiling movie reviews, but Doyle, Roberts and Dietz saw an opportunity to cover a broader range of media. They sold Metacritic to [[CNET]] in 2005.<ref name="wsj" /> CNET and Metacritic were later acquired by the [[CBS Corporation]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Columbia Journalism Review - CJR's guide to what the major media companies own |url=https://www.cjr.org/resources/?c=cbs/ |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160417001749/https://www.cjr.org/resources/?c=cbs%2F |archive-date=April 17, 2016 |access-date=November 28, 2011 |website=[[Columbia Journalism Review]]}}</ref>

=== Influence ===
Metacritic has been used by businesses to predict future sales. In 2007, Nick Wingfield of ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' wrote that Metacritic "influence[s] the sales of games and the stocks of video game publishers". He explains its influence as coming from the higher cost of buying video games than music or movie tickets. Many executives say that low scores "can hurt the long-term sales potential". Wingfield wrote that [[Wall Street]] pays attention to Metacritic and [[GameRankings]] because the sites typically post scores before sales data are publicly available, citing the respective rapid rise and fall in company values after ''[[BioShock]]'' and ''[[Spider-Man 3 (video game)|Spider-Man 3]]'' were released.<ref name=wsj/> In an interview with ''[[The Guardian]]'', Marc Doyle cited two major publishers that "conducted comprehensive statistical surveys through which they've been able to draw a correlation between high metascores and stronger sales" in certain genres. He claimed that an increasing number of businesses and financial analysts use Metacritic as "an early indicator of a game's potential sales and, by extension, the publisher's stock price".<ref name="guardian">{{Cite interview |first=Marc |last=Doyle |interviewer-last=Stuart |interviewer-first=Keith |date=January 17, 2008 |title=Interview: the science and art of Metacritic |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2008/jan/17/interviewtheartofmetacriti |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006170012/http://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2008/jan/17/interviewtheartofmetacriti |archive-date=October 6, 2014 |access-date=February 15, 2008 |website=[[The Guardian]]}}</ref> However, a 2015 study analyzing over 88 [[Xbox 360]] and 80 [[PS3]] games from 2012 found that Metacritic scores did not impact actual sales.<ref name="study-2015">{{Cite web |last=Khan |first=Imad |date=December 11, 2015 |title=Do Metacritic scores affect game sales? |url=https://www.dailydot.com/parsec/metacritic-scores-game-sales-gdc-2015/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190412125048/https://www.dailydot.com/parsec/metacritic-scores-game-sales-gdc-2015/ |archive-date=April 12, 2019 |access-date=September 12, 2019 |website=[[The Daily Dot]]}}</ref>

Controversially, the website has been used by game publishers as a means of determining whether a game's developer receives additional royalties. One notable example is the 2010 game ''[[Fallout: New Vegas]]'', which received an average Metascore of 84—one point too short of Bethesda's, the game's publisher, 85-point requirement. As a result, its developer, Obsidian Entertainment, received no additional bonus. Columnists took issue with the company's use of Metacritic, with one suggesting that this makes game critics ultimately accountable for deciding the developer's profits and another pointing out that a Metascore of 84 is not significantly lower than 85. The latter also pointed out the impressive sales of five million sold units and US$300&nbsp;million in revenue, and also noted a series of Obsidian's layoffs in 2011 and 2012.<ref name="obsidian-ign">{{Cite web |last=MacDonald |first=Keza |date=July 16, 2012 |title=Is Metacritic Ruining The Games Industry? |url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2012/07/16/is-metacritic-ruining-the-games-industry |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200211222552/https://www.ign.com/articles/2012/07/16/is-metacritic-ruining-the-games-industry |archive-date=February 11, 2020 |access-date=September 8, 2019 |website=[[IGN]]}}</ref><ref name="obsidian-ars">{{Cite web |last=Orland |first=Kyle |date=March 15, 2012 |title=Why linking developer bonuses to Metacritic scores should come to an end |url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2012/03/why-linking-developer-bonuses-to-metacritic-scores-should-come-to-an-end/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191217104009/https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2012/03/why-linking-developer-bonuses-to-metacritic-scores-should-come-to-an-end/ |archive-date=December 17, 2019 |access-date=September 12, 2019 |website=[[Ars Technica]]}}</ref>

On the other hand, the website has been used by columnists and commentators as a general reference for critical reception,<ref>{{Cite web |last=Gilbert |first=Ben |date=May 9, 2019 |title=The 10 best Pokémon games of all time, according to critics |url=https://www.businessinsider.com/best-pokemon-games-of-all-time-2019-5 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190927084744/https://www.businessinsider.com/best-pokemon-games-of-all-time-2019-5 |archive-date=September 27, 2019 |access-date=September 8, 2019 |website=[[Business Insider]]}}</ref> and by publishers as a tool of improving their products. Along with other executives, in 2008, [[John Riccitiello]], then CEO of Electronic Arts, showed Wall Street analysts a chart illustrating a downward trend in the average critical ratings of the company's games. He took the ratings seriously and stressed the need for the company to bounce back.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Hillis |first=Scott |date=February 21, 2008 |title=Game scoring site wields industry clout |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-videogames-metacritic-life/game-scoring-site-wields-industry-clout-idUSN1930453120080221?pageNumber=3&virtualBrandChannel=0 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200207175554/https://www.reuters.com/article/us-videogames-metacritic-life/game-scoring-site-wields-industry-clout-idUSN1930453120080221?pageNumber=3&virtualBrandChannel=0 |archive-date=February 7, 2020 |access-date=September 8, 2019 |website=[[Reuters]]}}</ref> Also in 2008, Microsoft used Metacritic averages to delist underperforming [[Xbox Live Arcade]] games.<ref name="xbladelistings">{{Cite web |last=Remo |first=Chris |date=May 22, 2008 |title=Microsoft To Delist Low-Ranking XBLA Titles, Raise Size Limit |url=http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=18759 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080525200501/http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=18759 |archive-date=May 25, 2008 |access-date=May 22, 2008 |website=[[Gamasutra]]}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Keiser |first=Joe |date=May 22, 2008 |title=EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW: MS to Delist XBLA Titles |url=http://www.next-gen.biz/features/exclusive-interview-ms-delist-xbla-titles |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120820031319/http://www.edge-online.com/features/exclusive-interview-ms-delist-xbla-titles |page=1 |archive-date=January 24, 2012 |access-date=May 29, 2008 |website=Next Generation}}</ref>

== Metascores ==
Scores are weighted averages.  Certain publications are given more significance "because of their stature".<ref name=wsj/> Metacritic has said that it will not reveal the relative weight assigned to each reviewer.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Frequently Asked Questions |url=https://www.metacritic.com/faq#item19 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150813223711/http://www.metacritic.com/faq#item19 |archive-date=August 13, 2015 |access-date=July 29, 2015 |website=Metacritic |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]}}</ref>

Games Editor Marc Doyle was interviewed in 2008 by Keith Stuart of ''[[The Guardian]]'' to "get a look behind the metascoring process". Stuart wrote: "The metascore phenomenon, namely Metacritic and [[GameRankings]], have become an enormously important element of online games journalism over the past few years".<ref name=guardian/> Doyle said that because video games lead to a greater investment of time and money, gamers are more informed about reviews than are fans of film or music; they want to know "whether that hotly anticipated title is going to deliver".<ref name=guardian/>

In June 2018, Metacritic established the "Must-See" label for a movie that "achieves a Metascore of 81 or higher and has been reviewed by a minimum of 15 professional critics".<ref>{{Cite web |date=June 11, 2018 |title=New on Metacritic: Must-See Movies |url=https://www.metacritic.com/feature/metacritic-must-see-movies |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181018030135/https://www.metacritic.com/feature/metacritic-must-see-movies |archive-date=October 18, 2018 |access-date=October 16, 2018 |website=Metacritic |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]}}</ref> In September 2018, it added the "Must-Play" certification for video games attaining a score of 90% or more, and a minimum number of 15 reviews from industry professionals.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Leonard |first=Matt |date=September 12, 2018 |title=Metacritic Adds ‘Must-Play’ Label to Highly Reviewed Games |url=https://www.gamerevolution.com/news/431169-review-aggregator-metacritic-adds-must-play-label-to-games |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200227110719/https://www.gamerevolution.com/news/431169-review-aggregator-metacritic-adds-must-play-label-to-games |archive-date=February 27, 2020 |access-date=September 9, 2019 |website=[[Game Revolution]]}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=September 12, 2018 |title=New on Metacritic: Must-Play Games |url=https://www.metacritic.com/feature/metacritic-must-play-games |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180914182901/https://www.metacritic.com/feature/metacritic-must-play-games |archive-date=September 14, 2018 |access-date=April 24, 2020 |website=Metacritic |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]}}</ref>

=== Criticism ===
Metacritic has been criticized for converting all scoring systems into a single quantitative percentage-based scale. For example, an "A" score equates to the value of 100, an "F" the value of zero, and a "B–" the value of 67.<ref name="guardian" /> Joe Dodson, former editor at [[Game Revolution]], criticized Metacritic and similar sites for turning reviews into scores that he found to be too low.<ref name="wsj" /> Doyle defended the grading system, believing that every scale should be converted directly to that of the website, with its lowest possible score being 0 and the highest 100.<ref name="guardian" /> Further criticism was directed to the website's refusal to publicize how it aggregates scores.<ref name=study-2015/>

According to Doyle, publishers often try to persuade him to exclude reviews they feel are unfair, but he said that once a publication is included, he refuses to omit any of its reviews.<ref name="wsj">{{Cite web |last=Wingfield |first=Nick |date=September 20, 2007 |title=High Scores Matter To Game Makers, Too |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB119024844874433247 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150215151615/http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB119024844874433247 |archive-date=February 15, 2015 |access-date=February 15, 2008 |website=[[The Wall Street Journal]]}}</ref> A ''[[Washington Post]]'' review of ''[[Uncharted 4]]'' was assigned with a rating of 40/100 by Metacritic; this was the only negative review of the game.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Uncharted 4: A Thief's End for Playstation 4 Reviews |url=https://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/uncharted-4-a-thiefs-end |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180813005123/http://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/uncharted-4-a-thiefs-end |archive-date=August 13, 2018 |access-date=August 6, 2018 |website=Metacritic |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]}}</ref> Readers who disapproved of the review petitioned Metacritic to remove the ''Post'' as a trusted source.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Schreier |first=Jason |date=May 16, 2016 |title=Reviewer Targeted For Giving Uncharted 4 Negative Review |url=http://kotaku.com/reviewer-targeted-for-giving-uncharted-4-negative-revie-1776854933 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160516170758/http://kotaku.com/reviewer-targeted-for-giving-uncharted-4-negative-revie-1776854933 |archive-date=May 16, 2016 |access-date=May 16, 2016 |publisher=[[Kotaku]]}}</ref> As a result of its perceived negative influence on the industry, several reviewing sites, including ''[[Kotaku]]'' and ''[[Eurogamer]]'', have dropped numerical reviews that would appear in Metacritic, instead favoring a qualitative assessment of a game.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Tolito |first=Stephan |date=January 30, 2012 |title=How We Will Review Games |url=http://kotaku.com/5880486/how-we-will-review-games |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150210214030/http://kotaku.com/5880486/how-we-will-review-games |archive-date=February 10, 2015 |access-date=February 10, 2015 |publisher=[[Kotaku]]}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Welsh |first=Oli |date=February 10, 2015 |title=Eurogamer has dropped review scores |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2015-02-10-eurogamer-has-dropped-review-scores |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150210180517/http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2015-02-10-eurogamer-has-dropped-review-scores |archive-date=February 10, 2015 |access-date=February 10, 2015 |publisher=[[Eurogamer]]}}</ref> ''Kotaku'' also highlighted a practice alleged to be used by some publishers who use Metacritic scores as a way to leverage more favorable terms for the publisher or deny developers bonuses should they not reach a certain score. Doyle countered this by saying "Metacritic has absolutely nothing to do with how the industry uses our numbers... Metacritic has always been about educating the gamer. We're using product reviews as a tool to help them make the most of their time and money." <ref>{{Cite web |last=Schreier |first=Jason |date=August 8, 2015 |title=Metacritic Matters: How Review Scores Hurt Video Games |url=https://kotaku.com/metacritic-matters-how-review-scores-hurt-video-games-472462218 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191118031546/https://kotaku.com/metacritic-matters-how-review-scores-hurt-video-games-472462218 |archive-date=November 18, 2019 |access-date=November 27, 2019 |publisher=[[Kotaku]]}}</ref>
