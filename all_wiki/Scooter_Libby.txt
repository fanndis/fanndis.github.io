===Name and nicknames===
====First name and suffix====
Libby has been secretive about his full name.<ref name=Pesca/><ref name="Schmitt1"/>  He was [[prosecute]]d as ''I. Lewis Libby, also known as "Scooter Libby".''  [[National Public Radio]]'s ''[[Day to Day]]'' reported<ref name=Pesca/> that the 1972 ''Yale Banner'' (the yearbook of [[Yale University]]) gave his name as ''Irve Lewis Libby Jr.''; it is unclear if ''Irve'' is his [[given name]], or if it is short for ''Irving'', as it was for his father. [[CBS]],<ref name=SSmith/> the [[BBC]],<ref name=BBC>Paul Reynolds, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/4386076.stm "Indictment Rocks Bush Administration"], [[BBC News]], October 28, 2007; accessed July 16, 2007.</ref> and the ''[[New York Times]]''{{'}}s [[John Tierney (journalist)|John Tierney]] have all used this spelling of his first name. The ''Times''{{'}}s [[Eric Schmitt]] spelled it ''Irv'',<ref name="Schmitt1"/> though he cited a phone interview with Libby's brother, and did not clarify if he had asked for a spelling.

At times, including in the ''Yale Banner'', and as documented in a federal directory cited by [[Ron Kampeas]] and others, Libby has used the [[suffix (name)|suffix]] ''Jr.'' after his name.<ref name=TheCounts/><ref name=Pesca/><ref name=Kampeas/> At other times, however, as listed in his federal indictment and ''[[United States v. Libby]]'', which give his [[Pseudonym|alias]] as ''Scooter Libby'', there is no ''Jr.'' after Libby's name.<ref name=indictment/> The Columbia Alumni Association online directory lists him as I.

====Nickname====
Libby has also been secretive about the origin of his nickname ''Scooter''. The ''New York Times''{{'}}s Eric Schmitt, citing the aforementioned interview with Libby's brother, wrote that "His [[nickname]] 'Scooter' derives from the day [his] father watched him crawling in his crib and joked, 'He's a Scooter!{{' "}}<ref name="Schmitt1"/>

In their February 2002 interview on ''[[Larry King Live]]'', King asked Libby specifically, "Where did 'Scooter' come from?"; Libby replied: "Oh, it goes way back to when I was a kid. Some people ask me if ... [crosstalk] ... as you did earlier, if it's related to [[Phil Rizzuto]] [nicknamed 'The Scooter']. I had the range but not the arm."<ref name=larryking>Larry King and Lewis 'Scooter' Libby, [http://www.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0202/16/lklw.00.html "Rush Transcript:] CNN Larry King Weekend: Interviews with Lewis 'Scooter' Libby, Don Rickles, Mike Medavoy", ''[[Larry King Live]]'', [[CNN]], aired February 16, 2002; accessed February 27, 2007.</ref>

In that order, "the Board directed the Bar Counsel to file a brief addressing whether [Libby's] crimes inherently involve [[moral turpitude]]." In its brief, filed on April 24, 2007, entitled [http://pdfserver.amlaw.com/dc/arbitraryjustice_book137.pdf "Statement of Bar Counsel"], the D.C. Bar stated that his crimes amounted to "moral turpitude" and recommended to the [[District of Columbia Court of Appeals]] Board on Professional Responsibility that Libby "be disbarred pursuant to D.C. Code § 11-2503(a)", which reads (in pertinent part): "When a member of the bar of the District of Columbia Court of Appeals is convicted of an offense involving moral turpitude ... the court shall, pending final determination of an appeal from the conviction, suspend the member of the bar from practice ... If a final judgment of conviction is certified to the court, the name of the member of the bar so convicted shall be struck from the roll of the members of the bar and such person shall thereafter cease to be a member."

Bar R. XI, § 14(g)." The brief lists Libby's admission to practice law in that jurisdiction as May 19, 1978.

==Government public service and political career==
In 1981, after working as a lawyer in the Philadelphia firm Schnader LLP, Libby accepted the invitation of his former [[Yale University]] political science professor and mentor [[Paul Wolfowitz]] to join the [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]]'s policy planning staff.<ref name=Mirkinson/><ref name=wrmea/>  From 1982 to 1985, Libby served as director of special projects in the Bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs.<ref name=stdeptprofile/> In 1985 he received the Foreign Affairs Award for Public Service from the [[United States Department of Defense]], and he resigned from government to enter private legal practice at [[Dickstein Shapiro|Dickstein, Shapiro, and Morin]].<ref name=wrmea/> In 1989, he went to work at the Pentagon, again under Wolfowitz, as principal deputy under-secretary for strategy and resources at the [[United States Department of Defense|U.S. Defense Department]].<ref name=stdeptprofile/>

During the [[George H.&nbsp;W.

In 1993 Libby received the Distinguished Service Award from the U.S. Defense Department and the Distinguished Public Service Award from the U.S. State Department before resuming private legal practice first at [[Mudge Rose Guthrie Alexander & Ferdon|Mudge Rose]] and then at [[Dechert]].

After becoming Cheney's chief of staff in 2001, Libby was reportedly nicknamed "Germ Boy" at the White House, for insisting on universal [[smallpox]] [[vaccination]].<ref name=germboy>Jeremy Scahill, [http://www.thenation.com/doc/20051128/scahill "Germ Boys and Yes Men"], online posting, ''[[The Nation]]'', November 9, 2005 (November 28, 2005 issue): 2; accessed March 3, 2007.</ref> He was also nicknamed "Dick Cheney's Dick Cheney" for his close working relationship with the Vice President. [[Mary Matalin]], who worked with Libby as an adviser to Cheney during Bush's first term, said of him "He is to the vice president what the vice president is to the president."<ref name=SSmith/><ref name=DCDC/>

Libby was active in the [[Defense Policy Board Advisory Committee]] of [[the Pentagon]] when it was chaired by [[Richard Perle]] during the early years of the [[George W. Bush administration]] (2001–2003).<ref name=wrmea/>  At various points in his career, Libby has also held positions with the [[American Bar Association]], been on the advisory board of the [[RAND Corporation]]'s Center for Russia and Eurasia, and been a legal adviser to the [[United States House of Representatives]], as well as served as a consultant for the [[defense contractor]] [[Northrop Grumman]].<ref name=wrmea/>

Libby was also actively involved in the Bush administration's efforts to negotiate the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict|Israeli–Palestinian]] [[Road map for peace|"road map" for peace]]; for example, he participated in a series of meetings with Jewish leaders in early December 2002 and a meeting with two aides of then-Israeli Prime Minister [[Ariel Sharon]] in mid-April 2003, culminating in the [[Road map for peace|Red Sea Summit]] on June 4, 2004.<ref name=Berger>Matthew E.

===Subsequent work experience===
From January 2006 until March 7, 2007, the day after his conviction in ''[[United States v.

Libby also serves as a member of the [[Blue Ribbon Study Panel on Biodefense]], a group that encourages and advocates changes to government policy to strengthen national [[biodefense]]. In order to address biological threats facing the nation, the Blue Ribbon Study Panel on Biodefense created a 33 step initiative for the U.S. Government to implement. Headed by former Senator Joe Lieberman and former Governor Tom Ridge, the Study Panel assembled in Washington D.C. for four meetings concerning current biodefense programs. The Study Panel concluded that the federal government had little to no defense mechanisms in case of a biological event. The Study Panel's final report, ''The National Blueprint for Biodefense'', proposes a string of solutions and recommendations for the U.S. Government to take, including items such as giving the Vice President authority over biodefense responsibilities and merging the entire biodefense budget. These solutions represent the Panel's call to action in order to increase awareness and activity for pandemic related issues.

==Involvement in the Plame affair==
{{Wikinewscat|Valerie Plame scandal}}
{{further|Plame affair|Plame affair grand jury investigation|Plame affair timeline}}
Between 2003 and 2005, intense speculation centered on the possibility that Libby may have been the administration official who had "leaked" classified employment information about [[Valerie Plame]], a [[Non-official cover|covert]] [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) agent and the wife of [[Iraq War]] critic [[Joseph C. Wilson]], to ''[[New York Times]]'' reporter [[Judith Miller (journalist)|Judith Miller]] and other reporters and later tried to hide his having done so.<ref name=GrieveManjoo>[[Farhad Manjoo]], [http://www.salon.com/politics/war_room/2005/10/11/waas/index.html "War Room: Did Scooter Libby Try to Hide His Meeting with Judith Miller?"], ''[[Salon.com|Salon]]'', October 11, 2005; accessed June 28, 2007.</ref><ref name=corn>[[David Corn]], [http://www.thenation.com/blogs/capitalgames?bid=3&pid=57174 "Will Scooter Libby Graymail the CIA?"], ''Capital Games'' (blog), ''[[The Nation]]'', February 6, 2006; accessed April 18, 2007.</ref>

In August 2005, as revealed in grand jury testimony audiotapes played during the trial and reported in many news accounts, Libby testified that he met with [[Judith Miller (journalist)|Judith Miller]], a reporter with the ''New York Times'', on July 8, 2003, and discussed Plame with her.<ref name=NPRLibbytest>[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=7262723 "Libby's Complete Grand Jury Testimony"], transcript and NPR audio player clips, ''[[National Public Radio]]'', February 9, 2007; accessed June 29, 2007.</ref>{{Main|Plame affair#Judith Miller}}
Although Libby signed a "blanket waiver" allowing journalists to discuss their conversations with him pursuant to the [[CIA leak grand jury investigation]], Miller maintained that such a waiver did not serve to allow her to reveal her source to that grand jury; moreover, Miller argued that Libby's general waiver pertaining to all journalists could have been [[coercion|coerced]] and that she would only testify before that grand jury if given an individual waiver.<ref name=Waasbk>For transcripts of the trial testimony, including that by [[Judith Miller (journalist)|Judith Miller]], "edited & with reporting by Murray Waas", see [[Murray Waas]], ed., with Jeff Lomonaco, ''The United States v. I. Lewis Libby'' (New York: Union Square Press (imprint of [[Sterling Publishing]]), 2007); {{ISBN|1-4027-5259-8}} (10); {{ISBN|978-1-4027-5259-9}} (13).</ref>

After refusing to testify about her July 2003 meeting with Libby, Judith Miller was jailed on July 7, 2005, for contempt of court. Months later, however, her new attorney, [[Robert S. Bennett|Robert Bennett]], told her that she already had possessed a written, voluntary waiver from Libby all along.<ref name=Carlson>[[Margaret Carlson]], [https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601109&sid=aPiGrodGdxWo&refer=muse "Time's Pearlstine Looks Back at Plamegate, Blames Floyd Abrams"], ''[[Bloomberg.com]]'', last updated June 27, 2007; accessed June 29, 2007.</ref>

After Miller had served most of her sentence, Libby reiterated that he had indeed given her a "waiver" both "voluntarily and personally."  He attached the following letter, which, when released publicly, became the subject of further speculation about Libby's possible motives in sending it:

<blockquote>As noted above, my lawyer confirmed my waiver to other reporters in just the way he did with your lawyer. Why? Because as I am sure will not be news to you, the public report of every other reporter's testimony makes clear that they did not discuss Ms. Plame's name or identity with me, or knew about her before our call.<br/>. ... <br/> You went to jail in the summer. It is fall now. You will have stories to cover – Iraqi elections and [[suicide bomb]]ers, [[bioterrorism|biological threats]], [[Avian influenza|bird flu]] and the [[Iranian nuclear program]]. Out West, where you vacation, the [[aspen]]s will already be turning. They turn in clusters, because their roots connect them. Come back to work—and life. Until then, you will remain in my thoughts and prayers.<br/>
With admiration, Scooter Libby.<ref name=Waasbk/><ref name=libby-miller>Lewis Libby, {{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/packages/pdf/national/nat_MILLER_051001.pdf |title="Letter from Libby to Judith Miller" }},&nbsp;{{small|(3.12&nbsp;[[Mebibyte|MiB]])}} ''[[The New York Times]]'', September 15, 2005, accessed February 17, 2007.</ref><ref name=Waas1>[[Murray Waas]], [http://nationaljournal.com/about/njweekly/stories/2005/1011nj1.htm "Libby Did Not Tell Grand Jury about Key Conversation"], ''[[The National Journal]]'', November 11, 2005; accessed June 29, 2007.</ref></blockquote>

After agreeing to testify, Miller was released on September 29, 2005, appearing before the grand jury the next day, but the charge against her was rescinded only after she testified again on October 12, 2005.<ref name=nyt-flame/>  For her second grand jury appearance, Miller produced a notebook from a previously undisclosed meeting with Libby on June 23, 2003, two weeks before Wilson's ''New York Times'' op-ed was published.<ref name=nyt-flame>[[Judith Miller (journalist)|Judith Miller]], [https://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/16/national/16miller.html "A Personal Account: My Four Hours Testifying in the Federal Grand Jury Room"], ''[[New York Times]]'', October 16, 2005; accessed March 23, 2008.</ref> In her account published in the ''Times'' on October 16, 2005, based on her notes, Miller reports:

<blockquote> ... in an interview with me on June 23 [2003], Vice President Dick Cheney's chief of staff, I. Lewis Libby, discussed Mr. Wilson's activities and placed blame for intelligence failures on the CIA. In later conversations with me, on July 8 and July 12 [2003], Mr. Libby, ... [at the time] Mr. Cheney's top aide, played down the importance of Mr. Wilson's mission and questioned his performance ... My notes indicate that well before Mr. Wilson published his critique, Mr. Libby told me that Mr. Wilson's wife may have worked on unconventional weapons at the CIA. ... My notes do not show that Mr. Libby identified Mr. Wilson's wife by name. Nor do they show that he described Valerie Wilson as a covert agent or "operative"...<ref name=nyt-flame/></blockquote>

Her notation on her July 8, 2003 meeting with Libby does contain the name "Valerie Flame {{sic}}", which she added retrospectively. While Miller reveals publicly that she herself had misidentified the last name of Wilson's wife (aka "Valerie Plame") in her own marginal notes on their interview as "Flame" instead of "Plame", in her grand jury (and later trial testimony), she remained uncertain when, how, and why she arrived at that name and did not attribute it to Libby:

<blockquote>I was not permitted to take notes of what I told the grand jury, and my interview notes on Mr. Libby are sketchy in places. It is also difficult, more than two years later, to parse the meaning and context of phrases, of underlining and of parentheses. On one page of my interview notes, for example, I wrote the name "Valerie Flame." Yet, as I told Mr. Fitzgerald, I simply could not recall where that came from, when I wrote it or why the name was misspelled ... I testified that I did not believe the name came from Mr. Libby, in part because the notation does not appear in the same part of my notebook as the interview notes from him.<ref name=nyt-flame/></blockquote>

A year and a half later, a jury convicted Libby of obstruction of justice and perjury in his grand jury testimony and making false statements to federal investigators about when and how he learned that Plame was a CIA agent.<ref name=TheCounts/><ref name=Waasbk/><ref name=SniffenApuzzo>Michael J.

On October 28, 2005, as a result of the [[CIA leak grand jury investigation]], [[U.S. Department of Justice Office of Special Counsel|Special Counsel]] Fitzgerald indicted Libby on five counts: one count of obstruction of justice, two counts of making false statements when interviewed by agents of the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]], and two counts of perjury in his testimony before the grand jury.<ref name=indictment/><ref name=HaydenInterview>[https://www.cia.gov/news-information/press-releases-statements/press-release-archive-2007/transcript-of-general-haydens-interview-with-wtop.html "Transcript of General Hayden's Interview with WTOP"], June 1, 2007</ref><ref name=Seidman>Joel Seidman, [http://www.nbcnews.com/id/18924679 "Plame Was 'covert' Agent At Time of Name Leak"], ''MSNBC.com'', May 29, 2007; accessed June 10, 2007.</ref><ref name=TheClassifiedInformation>[[Neil A.

On March 6, 2007, the jury [[convicted]] him on four of the five counts but [[acquittal|acquitted]] him on count three, the second charge of [[making false statements]] when interviewed by federal agents about his conversations with ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' reporter [[Matthew Cooper (American journalist)|Matthew Cooper]].<ref name=TheCounts>[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/l/i_lewis_libby_jr/index.html "I.

After being questioned by the FBI in the fall of 2003 and testifying before a Federal grand jury on March 5, 2004, and again on March 24, 2004, Libby pleaded not guilty to all five counts. According to the [[Associated Press]], [[David Addington]], Cheney's legal counsel, described a September 2003 meeting with Libby around the time that a criminal investigation began, saying that Libby had told him, {{" '}}I just want to tell you, I didn't do it' ...

Libby retained attorney [[Ted Wells]] of the firm of [[Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison]] to represent him. Wells had successfully defended former [[United States Secretary of Agriculture|Secretary of Agriculture]] [[Mike Espy]] against a 30-count indictment and had also participated in the successful defense of former [[United States Secretary of Labor|Secretary of Labor]] [[Raymond Donovan]].<ref name=VivecaNovak>[[Viveca Novak]], [http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/time/1998/12/07/independant.council.html "Was This a Bad Idea?] A Verdict Clearing Espy Is the Latest Sign That the Independent-Counsel Statute Is Likely to Perish", ''[[CNN News]]'', December 17, 1998, accessed July 3, 2007.</ref>

After Judge [[Reggie Walton]] denied Libby's [[motion to dismiss]], the press initially reported that Libby would testify at the trial.<ref name=Merritt>[[Jeralyn Merritt]], [http://talkleft.com/new_archives/015796.html "Libby to Testify at His Trial"], ''TalkLeft'' (accredited press blog), September 23, 2006; accessed January 24, 2007.</ref> Libby's [[criminal procedure|criminal trial]], ''[[United States v.

A parade of [[Pulitzer Prize]]–winning journalists testified, including [[Bob Woodward]], [[Walter Pincus]] and [[Glenn Kessler (journalist)|Glenn Kessler]] of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' and [[Judith Miller (journalist)|Judith Miller]] and [[David E. Sanger]] of ''The New York Times''. Despite earlier press reports and widespread speculation, neither Libby nor Vice President Cheney testified.<ref name=Waasbk/> The jury began deliberations on February 21, 2007.

===Verdict===
After deliberating for 10 days, the jury rendered its verdict on March 6, 2007.<ref name=MerrittVerdict>[[Jeralyn Merritt]], [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/discussion/2007/03/06/DI2007030600559.html "Verdict in the Libby Trial"], transcript, ''[[The Washington Post]]'' ("Live Online" discussion), March 6, 2007</ref> It convicted Libby on four of the five counts against him: two counts of perjury, one count of obstruction of justice in a [[grand jury]] investigation, and one of the two counts of making false statements to [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|federal investigators]].<ref name=TheCounts/><ref name=NYTGuilty>[[David Stout]] and Neil Lewis, [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/06/washington/06cnd-libby.html "Libby Guilty of Lying in C.I.A.

====Comment on the verdict by prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald====
Speaking to the media outside the courtroom after the verdict, Fitzgerald said that "The jury worked very long and hard and deliberated at length ... [and] was obviously convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant had lied and obstructed justice in a serious manner ... I do not expect to file any further charges."<ref name=CNNLibbylawyer/><ref name=MSNBCconvict>[http://www.nbcnews.com/id/17479718 "Jurors Convict Libby on Four of Five Charges:] Cheney's Ex-aide Faces Jail Time in CIA Leak Case; Sentencing Set for June", ''[[NBC News]]'', March 6, 2007, updated 9:18&nbsp;p.m., ET, accessed March 7, 2007.</ref><ref name=CNNvideoclip>[http://www.cnn.com/video/portable/promoplayer.html?mode=vod&video=/video/law/2007/03/06/sot.fitzgerald.libby.verdict.cnn&source=pop/ CNN video clip of Fitzgerald's remarks], March 6, 2007; accessed June 8, 2007. (Access limited to one viewing per day.)</ref> The trial confirmed that the leak came first from then-Deputy Secretary of State [[Richard Armitage (politician)|Richard Armitage]]; since Fitzgerald did not charge Armitage and did not charge anyone  else, Libby's conviction effectively ended the investigation.<ref name="SniffenApuzzo"/>

In his October 28, 2005, press conference about the grand jury's indictment, Fitzgerald had already explained that Libby's obstruction of justice through perjury and false statements had prevented the grand jury from determining whether the leak violated federal law.<ref name=WaPoTrans>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/10/28/AR2005102801340.html Transcript of Special Counsel Fitzgerald's press conference], ''[[The Washington Post]]'', October 28, 2005; accessed June 8, 2007.</ref>

During his media appearance outside the courtroom after the verdict in the Libby case, Fitzgerald fielded questions from the press about others involved in the [[Plame affair]] and in the [[CIA leak grand jury investigation]], such as Armitage and Cheney, whom he had already described as under "a cloud", as already addressed in his conduct of the case and in his closing arguments in court.<ref name=CNNvideoclip/><ref name=WaPoTrans/><ref name=Hardballverdict>[http://www.nbcnews.com/id/17500261 Transcript] and video clips presented on ''[[Hardball with Chris Matthews]]'', [[NBC News]], March 6, 2007</ref><ref name=MerrittClosing>[[Jeralyn Merritt]], [http://www.talkleft.com/story/2007/2/24/141015/646 "Fitz Closing in Libby; Cheney Is Under a Cloud"] ''TalkLeft'' (accredited press blog), February 24, 2007; accessed June 8, 2007, observes that "Fitzgerald squarely blames Libby for putting the cloud on the Vice President," quoting from Fitzgerald's closing arguments, e.g.:

<blockquote>There is a cloud over the vice president. He sent Libby off to [meet with former New York Times reporter] Judith Miller at the St. Regis Hotel. At that meeting, the two-hour meeting, the defendant [Libby] talked about the wife [Plame]. We didn't put that cloud there. That cloud remains because the defendant obstructed justice and lied about what happened ... He's put the doubt into whatever happened that week, whatever is going on between the Vice President and the defendant, that cloud was there. That's not something that we put there. That cloud is something that we just can't pretend isn't there.</blockquote></ref>

====Comment on the verdict by Libby's defense team====
After the verdict, initially, Libby's lawyers announced that he would seek a new trial, and that, if that attempt were to fail, they would [[appeal]] Libby's conviction.<ref name=CNNLibbylawyer>[http://www.cnn.com/2007/POLITICS/03/06/cia.leak/index.html "Libby Lawyer Demands New Trial After Conviction"], ''[[CNN Newsroom]]'', March 6, 2007; accessed March 6, 2007.</ref><ref name=CNNNewsroom>[http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/2005/cia.leak/index.html "Libby Found Guilty of Perjury, Obstruction"], ''[[CNN Newsroom]]'', March 6, 2007, accessed March 6, 2007.</ref> Libby did not speak to reporters.<ref name=SniffenApuzzo/> Libby's defense team eventually decided against seeking a new trial.<ref name=SemblerJune1>[[Mel Sembler|Ambassador Mel Sembler]], Chairman, Libby Defense Trust, and the Advisory Committee, [http://www.scooterlibby.com/ "Message from the Chairman"], ''Libby Defense Trust'', ''scooterlibby.com'', June 1, 2007, accessed June 5, 2007.</ref>

===Sentencing===
Given current federal sentencing guidelines, which are not mandatory, the conviction could have resulted in a sentence ranging from no imprisonment to imprisonment of up to 25 years and a fine of $1,000,000; yet, as Sniffen and Apuzzo observe, "federal sentencing guidelines will probably prescribe far less."<ref name=SniffenApuzzo/> In practice, according to federal sentencing data, three-fourths of the 198 defendants found guilty of obstruction of justice in 2006 served jail time. The average length of jail time on this charge alone was 70 months.<ref name=metguidelines>Richard B. Schmitt and David G.

===Order to report to prison pending appeal of verdict===
After the June 5 sentencing, Walton said he was inclined to jail Libby after the defense laid out its proposed appeal, but the judge told attorneys he was open to changing his mind"; however, on June 14, 2007, Walton ordered Libby to report to prison while his attorneys appealed the conviction.<ref name=CNNJudge/>  Libby's attorneys asked that the order be stayed, but Walton denied the request and told Libby that he would have 10 days to appeal the ruling.<ref name=CNNJudge/> In denying Libby's request, which had questioned Fitzgerald's authority to make the charges in the first place, Walton supported Fitzgerald's authority in the case. He said: "Everyone is accountable, and if you work in the White House, and if it's perceived that somehow (you're) linked at the hip, the American public would have serious questions about the fairness of any investigation of a high-level official conducted by the attorney general."<ref name=CNNJudge/>  The judge was also responding to an [[Amicus curiae]] brief that he had permitted to be filed, which had not apparently convinced him to change his mind, as he subsequently denied Libby bail during his appeal.<ref name=AmicusCuriaeBr>Cf.

<blockquote> ... It is an impressive show of public service when twelve prominent and distinguished current and former law professors are able to amass their collective wisdom in the course of only several days to provide their legal expertise to the court on behalf of a criminal defendant. The Court trusts that this is a reflection of these eminent academics' willingness in the future to step to the plate and provide like assistance in cases involving any of the numerous litigants, both in this Court and throughout the courts of this nation, who lack the financial means to fully and properly articulate the merits of their legal positions even in instances where failure to do so could result in monetary penalties, incarceration, or worse. The Court will certainly not hesitate to call for such assistance from these luminaries, as necessary in the interests of justice and equity, whenever similar questions arise in the cases that come before it."<ref name=Gerstein/></blockquote>

Moreover, when the hearing started, "in the interest of full disclosure," Walton informed the court that he had "received a number of harassing, angry and mean-spirited phone calls and messages. Some wishing bad things on me and my family ... [T]hose types of things will have no impact ... I initially threw them away, but then there were more, some that were more hateful ... [T]hey are being kept."<ref name=CNNJudge/>

''New York Times'' reporters Neil Lewis and David Stout estimated subsequently that Libby's prison sentence could begin within "two months", explaining that

<blockquote>Judge Walton's decision means that the defense lawyers will probably ask a federal appeals court to block the sentence, a long-shot move. It also sharpens interest in a question being asked by Mr. Libby's supporters and critics alike: Will President Bush pardon Mr. Libby? ... So far, the president has expressed sympathy for Mr. Libby and his family but has not tipped his hand on the pardon issue. ... If the president does not pardon him, and if an appeals court refuses to second-guess Judge Walton's decision, Mr. Libby will probably be ordered to report to prison in six to eight weeks' time. Federal prison authorities will decide where. "Unless the Court of Appeals overturns my ruling, he will have to report", Judge Walton said.<ref name=LewisStout>Neil A.

On July 2, 2007, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C.

===Presidential commutation===

Soon after the verdict, calls for Libby to be [[pardon]]ed by President [[George W.

Surveying "the pardon battle" and citing both pro and con publications, ''[[The Washington Post]]'' online columnist [[Dan Froomkin]] concludes that many U.S. newspapers opposed a presidential pardon for Libby.<ref name=Froomkin>[[Dan Froomkin]], [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/blog/2007/06/07/BL2007060701120.html "Many Newspapers Oppose Pardon"], ''White House Watch'' (column and blog), ''[[The Washington Post|washingtonpost.com]]'', June 7, 2007; accessed June 7, 2007.</ref> Much of this commentary obscured the fact that the clemency power provided the President with several options short of a full, unconditional pardon. In an op-ed published in ''[[The Washington Post]]'', former federal prosecutor and conservative activist [[William Otis (lawyer)|William Otis]] argued the sentence was too stringent and that, instead of pardoning Libby, Bush should commute his sentence.<ref name=Otis>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/06/06/AR2007060602292.html?hpid=opinionsbox1 "Neither Prison Nor Pardon: Justice in the Libby Case Lies With Bush's Third Option" by William Otis], ''[[The Washington Post]]'', June 7, 2007: A-27; posted online June 7, 2007; accessed June 7, 2007.</ref>

After Libby was denied [[bail]] during his appeal process on July 2, 2007, Bush [[Commutation of sentence|commuted]] Libby's 30-month federal prison sentence, calling it "excessive", but he did not change the other parts of the sentence and their conditions.<ref name=Chen/> That presidential commutation left in place the felony conviction, the $250,000 fine, and the terms of probation.<ref name=GWBWHP/><ref name=Chen/> Some have criticized the move, as presidential commutations are rarely issued, but when granted they have generally occurred after the convicted person has already served a substantial portion of his or her sentence: "We can't find any cases, certainly in the last half-century, where the president commuted a sentence before it had even started to be served," said former [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] pardon [[Lawyer|attorney]] Margaret Colgate Love.<ref name=metguidelines/> Others, notably Cheney himself who argued that Libby was unfairly charged by a politically motivated prosecution, believed that the commutation fell short, as Libby would likely never practice law again.<ref name="inside">{{cite news| url= http://www.time.com/time/politics/article/0,8599,1912297-2,00.html|title=Inside Bush and Cheney's Final Days| work= [[Time (magazine)|Time]]| first1= Massimo |last1= Calabresi | first2= Michael |last2= Weisskopf| authorlink2= Michael Weisskopf |date=July 24, 2009|accessdate=July 24, 2009|quote=[A]mong Bush aides, the presidential statement was seen as a fail-safe, a device that would prevent a backtrack later on.

Bush's allies would say later that the language was intended to send an unmistakable message, internally as well as externally: No one is above the law.}}</ref>

At the time, Bush explained his "Grant of Executive Clemency" to Libby, in part, as follows:
:Mr. Libby was sentenced to thirty months of prison, two years of probation, and a $250,000 fine. In making the sentencing decision, the district court rejected the advice of the probation office, which recommended a lesser sentence and the consideration of factors that could have led to a sentence of home confinement or probation.

{{quote|
I respect the jury's verdict. But I have concluded that the prison sentence given to Mr. Libby is excessive. Therefore, I am commuting the portion of Mr. Libby's sentence that required him to spend thirty months in prison.

My decision to commute his prison sentence leaves in place a harsh punishment for Mr. Libby. The reputation he gained through his years of public service and professional work in the legal community is forever damaged. His wife and young children have also suffered immensely. He will remain on probation. The significant fines imposed by the judge will remain in effect. The consequences of his felony conviction on his former life as a lawyer, public servant, and private citizen will be long-lasting.<ref name=GWBWHP/><ref name="GWBWHP2">{{cite web|url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2007/07/20070702-3.html|title=Statement by the President on Executive Clemency for Lewis Libby|accessdate=2017-07-24|date=2007-07-02}}</ref>}}

Bush's explanation was written by [[Fred F. Fielding]], [[White House Counsel]] during the last two years of Bush's presidency. According to a ''Time Magazine'' article published six months after Bush left office, Fielding worded the commutation "in a way that would make it harder for Bush to revisit it in the future ... ; [the] language was intended to send an unmistakable message, internally as well as externally: No one is above the law." The article suggested that there was a fundamental difference between how Bush and Cheney viewed the "War on Terror", with aides close to Bush feeling that Cheney had misled the President and damaged the administration's moral character with the Plame leak.<ref name="inside" />

Libby's lawyer, [[Ted Wells|Theodore V. Wells, Jr.]] "issued a brief statement saying Mr. Libby and his family 'wished to express their gratitude for the president's decision ...

Prosecutor [[Patrick Fitzgerald]], however, took issue with Bush's description of the sentence as 'excessive', saying it was "[i]mposed pursuant to the laws governing sentencings which occur every day throughout this country ... It is fundamental to the rule of law that all citizens stand before the bar of justice as equals ... [T]hat principle guided the judge during both the trial and the sentencing," Fitzgerald said.<ref name=CNNBushComm>Qtd. by [[CNN]], [http://us.cnn.com/2007/POLITICS/07/02/libby.sentence/index.html "Bush Commutes Libby's Prison Sentence"], ''CNN News'', July 2, 2007 (updated periodically), accessed July 3, 2007.</ref>

The day after the commuting of Libby's sentence, James Rowley ([[Bloomberg News]]) reported that Bush had not ruled out pardoning Libby in the future and that Bush's press spokesman, [[Tony Snow]], denied any political motivation in the commutation.

In his public statement accompanying his executive clemency proclamation, Bush stated that he believes the sentence "harsh ... based in part on allegations never presented to the jury," that "[the] reputation [Libby] gained through his years of public service and professional work in the legal community is forever damaged," and that "[the] consequences of his [[Felony|felony conviction]] on his former life as a lawyer, public servant, and private citizen will be long-lasting."<ref name=GWBWHP/><ref name=Chen/> Libby paid the required fine of "$250,400, which included a 'special assessment' of costs" that same day.<ref name= LewisRutenberg>{{cite news| first1= Neil |last1= Lewis | first2= Jim |last2= Rutenberg| url= https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/06/washington/06libby.html |title= Libby Pays Fine; Judge Poses Probation Query| work= The New York Times| date= July 6, 2007}}</ref>

Just a few days later, however, Judge Walton questioned "whether ... [Libby] will face two years of probation, as [President Bush] said he would," because the supervised release time is conditioned on Libby's serving the prison sentence, and he "directed the special prosecutor, [[Patrick J.

[Bush's] argument that ... Libby still faced stiff justice."<ref name=LewisRutenberg/> That issue was resolved on July 10, 2007, clearing the way for Libby to begin serving the rest of his sentence, the supervised release and 400 hours of community service.<ref name=Lewisclear>{{cite news| first= Neil A. |last= Lewis| url= https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/10/washington/10libby.html| title= Issue of Supervised Release for Libby Is Cleared Up| work= The New York Times| date= July 10, 2007}}</ref>

In response to Bush's justifications for [[Pardon|clemency]], liberal commentator Harlan J. Protass noted that in ''[[Rita v.

Reportedly outraged by Bush's commutation of Libby's prison sentence, on July 2, 2007, Wilson told [[CNN]]: "I have nothing to say to Scooter Libby ... I don't owe this administration. They owe my wife and my family an apology for having betrayed her. Scooter Libby is a traitor. Bush's action ... demonstrates that the White House is corrupt from top to bottom."<ref name=CNNBushComm/><ref name=WilsonStmtComm/> He reiterated this perspective on the commutation in the [[United States House Judiciary Committee|House Judiciary Committee]] hearing on July 11, 2007, vehemently protesting that a [[Republican Party of the United States|Republican]] congressman was engaging in "yet a further smear of my wife's good name and my good name."<ref name=Houseclem/><ref name=HirschfeldDavis/>

According to a ''[[USA Today]]''/[[Gallup Poll]] conducted from July 6 to July 8, 2007, "most Americans disagree with President George W. Bush's decision to intervene" on Libby's behalf in the case.<ref name=Gallup>Jeffrey M. Jones ([[Gallup Poll|Gallup News Service]]), "Two in Three Say Bush Should Not Have Intervened in Libby Case: Only 13% Say Commuting Sentence Was Right Thing to Do", ''[[USA Today]]/[[Gallup Poll]]'', July 10, 2007, accessed July 10, 2007: "The July 6–8 poll finds 66% of Americans saying Bush should not have intervened on Libby's behalf. Only 13% say Bush was 'right to commute Libby's sentence,' while even fewer, 6%, say Bush 'should have gone farther and granted [Libby] a full pardon.' About one in six have no opinion of the matter."</ref>

Several months after Bush's action, Judge Walton commented publicly on it. He spoke in favor of applying the law equally, stating: "The downside [of the commutation] is there are a lot of people in America who think that justice is determined to a large degree by who you are and that what you have plays a large role in what kind of justice you receive. ...

Bush took no further action with respect to Libby's conviction or sentence during his presidential term, despite entreaties from conservatives that he should be pardoned. Two days after their term expired, former Vice President Cheney expressed his regret that Bush had not pardoned Libby on his last day in office.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2009/01/22/cheney-to-magazine-bush-should-have-pardoned-libby|work=CNN|title=Cheney to magazine: Bush should have pardoned Libby|accessdate=May 7, 2010|date=January 22, 2009}}</ref>
