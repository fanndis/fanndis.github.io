'''Mixed-sex education''', also known as '''mixed-gender education''', '''co-education''', or '''coeducation''' (abbreviated to '''co-ed''' or '''coed'''), is a system of [[education]] where males and females are educated together. Whereas [[single-sex education]] was more common up to the 19th century, mixed-sex education has since become standard in many cultures, particularly in Western countries. Single-sex education, however, remains prevalent in many [[Muslim]] countries. The relative merits of both systems have been the subject of debate.

The world's oldest co-educational school is thought to be [[Archbishop Tenison's Church of England High School, Croydon]], established in 1714 in the [[United Kingdom]], which admitted boys and girls from its opening onwards.<ref name="churchtimes.co.uk">{{cite web |title=Archbishop's school, 300 years later |url=https://www.churchtimes.co.uk/articles/2014/9-may/news/uk/archbishop-s-school-300-years-later |website=The Church Times |accessdate=27 November 2019}}</ref> This has always been a day school only.

The world's oldest co-educational both day and boarding school is [[Dollar Academy]], a junior and senior school for males and females from ages 5 to 18 in [[Scotland]], United Kingdom. From its opening in 1818, the school admitted both boys and girls of the parish of [[Dollar, Clackmannanshire|Dollar]] and the surrounding area. The school continues in existence to the present day with around 1,250 pupils.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dollaracademy.org.uk/about-dollar |title=About Dollar |website=Dollar Academy |accessdate=10 June 2017}}</ref>

The first co-educational college to be founded was [[Oberlin Collegiate Institute]] in Oberlin, Ohio. It opened on 3 December 1833, with 44 students, including 29 men and 15 women. Fully equal status for women did not arrive until 1837, and the first three women to graduate with bachelor's degrees did so in 1840.<ref name="new.oberlin.edu">{{Cite web|url=https://new.oberlin.edu/about/history.dot|title=History {{!}} About Oberlin {{!}} Oberlin College|website=Oberlin College and Conservatory|access-date=2016-05-17}}</ref> By the late 20th century, many institutions of higher learning that had been exclusively for people of one sex had become coeducational.

==History==
In early civilizations, people were educated informally: primarily within the household. As time progressed, education became more structured and formal. Women often had very few rights when education started to become a more important aspect of civilization. Efforts of the ancient Greek and Chinese societies focused primarily on the education of males. In ancient Rome, the availability of education was gradually extended to women, but they were taught separately from men. The early Christians and medieval Europeans continued this trend, and single-sex schools for the privileged classes prevailed through the Reformation period.

In the 16th century, at the [[Council of Trent]], the Roman Catholic church reinforced the establishment of free elementary schools for children of all classes. The concept of universal elementary education, regardless of sex, had been created.<ref>"Coeducation." (n.d.): Funk & Wagnalls New World Encyclopedia. Web. 23 October 2012.</ref> After the Reformation, coeducation was introduced in western Europe, when certain Protestant groups urged that boys and girls should be taught to read the Bible. The practice became very popular in northern England, Scotland, and colonial New England, where young children, both male and female, attended [[dame school]]s. In the late 18th century, girls gradually were admitted to town schools. The [[Society of Friends]] in England, as well as in the United States, pioneered coeducation as they did universal education, and in Quaker settlements in the British colonies, boys and girls commonly attended school together. The new free public elementary, or [[common schools]], which after the [[American Revolution]] supplanted church institutions, were almost always coeducational, and by 1900 most public high schools were coeducational as well.<ref>"coeducation". Encyclopædia Britannica. Encyclopædia Britannica Online.  Encyclopædia Britannica Inc., 2012. Web. 23 October 2012.</ref> In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, coeducation grew much more widely accepted. In Great Britain, Germany, and the Soviet Union, the education of girls and boys in the same classes became an approved practice.

==Australia==
In Australia, there is a trend towards increased coeducational schooling with new coeducational schools opening, few new single-sex schools opening and existing single-sex schools combining or opening their doors to the opposite gender.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Guest|first1=Murray|title=The Single Sex v Coeducation Debate and the Experience of Schools that Change Status|url=http://www.as.edu.au/content/uploads/2015/02/Final-Coeducation_Research_Paper_Feb_2015.pdf|publisher=The Armidale School|accessdate=2 January 2017|location=Armidale, NSW|date=2014}}</ref>

==China==
The first mixed-sex institution of higher learning in [[China]] was the [[Nanjing University|Nanjing Higher Normal Institute]], which was renamed [[National Central University]] and [[Nanjing University]]. For millennia in China, public schools, especially public higher learning schools, were for men. Generally, only schools established by zōng zú (宗族, gens) were for both male and female students. Some schools such as [[Li Zhi (philosopher)|Li Zhi]]'s school in [[Ming dynasty]] and [[Yuan Mei]]'s school in [[Qing Dynasty]] enrolled both male and female students. In the 1910s, women's universities were established such as [[Ginling College|Ginling Women's University]] and Peking Girls' Higher Normal School, but there was no coeducation in higher learning schools.

[[Tao Xingzhi]], the Chinese advocator of mixed-sex education, proposed ''The Audit Law for Women Students'' (規定女子旁聽法案, Guī Dìng Nǚ Zi Páng Tīng Fǎ Àn) at the meeting of Nanjing Higher Normal School held on December seventh, 1919. He also proposed that the university recruit female students. The idea was supported by the president [[Kuo Ping-Wen]], academic director [[Liu Boming (philosopher)|Liu Boming]], and such famous professors as [[Lu Zhiwei]] and Yang Xingfo, but opposed by many famous men of the time. The meeting passed the law and decided to recruit women students next year. Nanjing Higher Normal School enrolled eight Chinese female students in 1920. In the same year [[Peking University]] also began to allow women students to audit classes. One of the most notable female students of that time was [[Chien-Shiung Wu]].

In 1949, the [[China|People's Republic of China]] was founded. The Chinese government pursued a policy of moving towards co-education and nearly all schools and universities have become mixed-sex.<ref>{{cite web |title=Single-sex Schools in China |url=https://www.hcrlaw.com/blog/single-sex-schools-in-china/ |website=Harrison, Clark, Rickerby's Solicitors |accessdate=3 December 2019}}</ref> In recent years, however, some female and/or single-sex schools have again emerged for special vocational training needs but equal rights for education still apply to all citizens.

Indigenous Muslim populations in China, the [[Hui people|Hui]] and [[Salar people|Salars]], find coeducation to be controversial, owing to some Islamic thought on gender roles. On the other hand, the Muslim [[Uyghur people|Uyghur]]s have not historically objected to coeducation.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qRSOAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA202 |title=China's universities, 1895-1995: a century of cultural conflict|author=Ruth Hayhoe|year=1996|publisher=Taylor & Francis|page=202|isbn=0-8153-1859-6|accessdate= 29 June 2010}}</ref>

==France==
Admission to the [[Sorbonne]] was opened to girls in 1860.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vUql-4-eW6QC&pg=PA35|title=La mixité dans l'éducation: Enjeux passés et présents|first1=Rebecca|last1=Rogers (Dir.)|first2=Marlaine|last2=Cacouault|date=30 January 2019|publisher=ENS Editions|via=Google Books|isbn=9782847880618}}</ref> The [[baccalauréat]] became gender-blind in 1924, giving equal chances to all girls in applying to any universities. Mixed-sex education became mandatory for primary schools in 1957 and for all universities in 1975.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ettajdid.org/spip.php?article138 |title=Réflexions sur la mixité scolaire en France |publisher=Ettajdid.org |accessdate=2013-09-16|language=fr}}</ref>

==Hong Kong==

{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}
[[St. Paul's Co-educational College]] was the first mixed-sex [[high school|secondary school]] in [[Hong Kong]]. It was founded in 1915 as St. Paul's Girls' College. At the end of [[World War II]], it was temporarily merged with [[St. Paul's College, Hong Kong|St. Paul's College]], which is a boys' school. When classes at the campus of St. Paul's College were resumed, it continued to be mixed and changed to its present name. Some other renowned mixed-sex secondary schools in town include Hong Kong Pui Ching Middle School, [[Queen Elizabeth School, Hong Kong|Queen Elizabeth School]] and [[Tsuen Wan Government Secondary School]]. Most of the Hong Kong primary and secondary schools are mixed-sex educations, include government public schools, charter schools, and private schools.

==Pakistan==
{{Further|Education in Pakistan|List of colleges in Pakistan|List of universities in Pakistan}}
[[Pakistan]] is one of the many [[Muslim]] countries where most [[school]]s and [[college]]s are single-gender although some schools and colleges, and most universities are coeducational. In schools that offer O levels and A levels, co-education is quite prevalent. After the [[Partition of India|independence]] of [[Pakistan]] in 1947, most universities were coeducational but the proportion of women was less than 5%. After the [[Islamization in Pakistan|Islamization]] policies in the early 1980s, the government established [[Women's college]]s and [[List of women's colleges|Women's universities]] to promote education among women who were hesitant to study in mixed-sex environment. Today, however, most universities and a large number of schools in urban areas are co-educational.

==United Kingdom==

{{Further|Education in the United Kingdom}}

===Schools===

In the United Kingdom the official term is ''mixed'',<ref>{{UK SI | year=2007 | number=2324 | url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?LegType=All+Legislation&searchDay=15&searchMonth=9&searchYear=2007&searchEnacted=0&text=mixed+sex&extent=E%2bW%2bS%2bN.I.&extentMatchOnly=0&confersPower=0&blanketAmendment=0&sortAlpha=0&PageNumber=1&NavFrom=0&parentActiveTextDocId=3399271&ActiveTextDocId=3399271&filesize=51744 | title=The Education (School Performance Information) (England) Regulations 2007}}, Schedule 6, regulation 11, clause 5(b).</ref> and today most [[school]]s are mixed. A number of Quaker co-educational boarding schools were established before the 19th century.

The world's oldest co-educational school is thought to be [[Archbishop Tenison's Church of England High School, Croydon]], established in 1714 in the United Kingdom, which admitted 10 boys and 10 girls from its opening, and remained co-educational thereafter.<ref name="churchtimes.co.uk"/> This is a day school only and still in existence.

The Scottish [[Dollar Academy]] was the first mixed-sex both day and boarding school in the UK. Founded in 1818, it is the oldest both boarding and day mixed-sex educational institution in the world still in existence. In England, the first non-Quaker mixed-sex public boarding school was [[Bedales School]], founded in 1893 by [[John Haden Badley]] and becoming mixed in 1898. Ruckleigh School in Solihull was founded by Cathleen Cartland in 1909 as a non-denominational co-educational preparatory school many decades before others followed.  Many previously [[single-sex school]]s have begun to accept both sexes in the past few decades: for example, [[Clifton College]] began to accept girls in 1987.<ref>Christine Skelton, ed. ''Whatever happens to little women?: gender and primary schooling'' (London:. Open University Press, 1989)</ref>

===Higher-education institutions===

{{further |University of Oxford#Women's education| University of Cambridge#Women's education}}

The first higher-education institution in the United Kingdom to allow women and men to enter on equal terms, and hence be admitted to academic degrees, was the [[University of Bristol]] (then established as [[University College, Bristol]]) in 1876.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bristol.ac.uk/university/history/|title=History of the University - About the University - University of Bristol|first=University of|last=Bristol|website=www.bristol.ac.uk}}</ref>

Given their dual role as both boarding house and educational establishment, individual colleges at Oxford and Cambridge remained segregated for much longer. The first Oxford college to house both men and women was the graduate-only [[Nuffield College]] in 1937; the first five undergraduate colleges (Brasenose, Hertford, Jesus, [[St Catherine's College, Oxford|St Catherine's]] and Wadham) became mixed in 1974. The first mixed Cambridge college was the graduate-only [[Darwin College, Cambridge|Darwin]] from its foundation in 1964. [[Churchill College, Cambridge|Churchill]], [[Clare College, Cambridge|Clare]] and [[King's College, Cambridge|King's]] Colleges were the first previously all-male colleges of the University of Cambridge to admit female [[undergraduate]]s in 1972. [[Magdalene College, Cambridge|Magdalene]] was the last all-male college to become mixed in 1988.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.theguardian.com/obituaries/story/0,3604,976477,00.html | title = Obituary – Professor Sir Bernard Williams| work = [[The Guardian]] | accessdate = 8 May 2009 | date = 13 June 2003}}</ref>

The last women's college in Oxford, [[St Hilda's College, Oxford|St Hilda's]], became mixed as of [[Michaelmas term]] 2008; however, some [[Permanent Private Hall]]s still exist which are open only to men. Three colleges remain single-sex (women-only) at Cambridge: [[Murray Edwards College, Cambridge|Murray Edwards (New Hall)]], [[Newnham College, Cambridge|Newnham]] and [[Lucy Cavendish College, Cambridge|Lucy Cavendish]].

[[File:Oberlin College - Bosworth Hall.jpg|thumb|[[Oberlin College]], the oldest extant mixed-sex institute of higher education in the United States]]

The oldest extant mixed-sex institute of higher education in the United States is [[Oberlin College]] in [[Oberlin, Ohio]], which was established in 1833.  Mixed-sex classes were admitted to the preparatory department at Oberlin in 1833 and the college department in 1837.<ref>{{cite web | title = One Hundred Years Toward Suffrage | url = http://lcweb2.loc.gov/ammem/naw/nawstime.html | accessdate = 26 January 2010}}</ref><ref name=Indiana>{{cite web | last = Jones | first = Christine | title = Indiana University: The Transition to Coeduation | url = http://www.indiana.edu/~iuspa/journal/editions/2002/Jones.pdf | accessdate = 11 January 2010}}</ref> The first four women to receive bachelor's degrees in the United States earned them at Oberlin in 1841.  Later, in 1862, the first black woman to receive a bachelor's degree ([[Mary Jane Patterson]]) also earned it from Oberlin College.  Beginning in 1844, [[Hillsdale College]] became the next college to admit mixed-sex classes to four-year degree programs.<ref>{{cite web | title = Hillsdale College – History & Misson | url = http://www.hillsdale.edu/about/history.asp | accessdate = 15 January 2010}}</ref>

The [[University of Iowa]] became the first coeducational [[Public university|public]] or state university in the United States in 1855,<ref name=Roch>{{cite web | first = A.J. | last = May | title = University of Rochester History | url = http://www.lib.rochester.edu/index.cfm?PAGE=2319 }}</ref> and for much of the next century, public universities, and [[Land-grant university|land grant universities]] in particular, would lead the way in mixed-sex higher education.  There were also many private coeducational universities founded in the 19th century, especially west of the Mississippi River. East of the Mississippi, [[Wheaton College (Illinois)]] graduated its first female student in 1862.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://a2z.my.wheaton.edu/wheaton-firsts|title=Wheaton "Firsts" - Wheaton History A to Z|website=a2z.my.wheaton.edu|access-date=2017-05-24}}</ref> [[Bates College]] in Maine was open to women from its founding in 1855, and graduated its first female student in 1869.<ref>{{cite web |title=Mary W.

Around the same time, [[Single-sex education|single-sex]] women's colleges were also appearing.  According to Irene Harwarth, Mindi Maline, and Elizabeth DeBra: "[[Women's colleges in the United States|women's college]]s were founded during the mid- and late-19th century in response to a need for advanced education for women at a time when they were not admitted to most institutions of higher education."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ed.gov/offices/OERI/PLLI/webreprt.html|title=Women's Colleges in the United States: History, Issues, and Challenges|accessdate=14 October 2006 |url-status=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060428110902/http://www.ed.gov/offices/OERI/PLLI/webreprt.html |archivedate=28 April 2006 }}</ref> Notable examples include the [[Seven Sisters (colleges)|Seven Sisters]] colleges, of which [[Vassar College]] is now coeducational and [[Radcliffe College]] has merged with [[Harvard University]].  Other notable women's colleges that have become coeducational include [[Wheaton College (Massachusetts)|Wheaton College]] in Massachusetts, [[Ohio Wesleyan Female College]] in [[Ohio]], [[Skidmore College]], [[Wells College]], and [[Sarah Lawrence College]] in New York state, [[Pitzer College]] in California, [[Goucher College]] in Maryland and [[Connecticut College]].

By 1900 the Briton [[Frederic Harrison]] said after visiting the United States that "The whole educational machinery of America ... open to women must be at least twentyfold greater than with us, and it is rapidly advancing to meet that of men both in numbers and quality".<ref name="stead1901">{{cite book | url=https://archive.org/stream/americanizationo01stea#page/384/mode/2up | title=The Americanization of the World | publisher=Horace Markley | author=Stead, W. T. | year=1901 | pages=385–386}}</ref> Where most of the history of coeducation in this period is a list of those moving toward the accommodation of both men and women at one campus, the state of Florida was an exception. In 1905, the [[Buckman Act]] was one of consolidation in governance and funding but separation in race and gender, with [[Florida State College for Women]] (since 1947, [[Florida State University]]) estsblished to serve white females during this era, the campus that became what is now the [[University of Florida]] serving white males, and coeducation stipulated only for the campus serving black students at the site of what is now [[Florida A&M University]]. Florida did not return to coeducation at UF and FSU until after World War II, prompted by the drastically increased demands placed on the higher education system by veterans studying via GI Bill programs following World War II. The Buckman arrangements officially ended with new legislation guidelines passed in 1947.

===Primary and secondary schools===
Several early [[Primary school|primary]] and [[secondary school]]s in the United States were single-sex.  Examples include [[Collegiate School (New York City)|Collegiate School]], a boys' school operating in New York by 1638 (which remains a single-sex institution); and [[Boston Latin School]], founded in 1635 (which did not become coeducational until 1972).

Nonetheless, mixed-sex education existed at the lower levels in the U.S. long before it extended to colleges.  For example, in 1787, the predecessor to [[Franklin & Marshall College]] in [[Lancaster, Pennsylvania]], opened as a mixed-sex secondary school.<ref>{{cite web|title=Milestones Achieved by the Women of F&M |url=http://www.fandm.edu/x22560 |accessdate=27 January 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091106111903/http://www.fandm.edu/x22560 |archivedate=6 November 2009 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=F&M: 40 Years of Coeducation |url=http://www.fandm.edu/40yearsofcoed |accessdate=27 January 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091105040810/http://www.fandm.edu/40yearsofcoed |archivedate=5 November 2009 }}</ref> Its first enrollment class consisted of 78 male and 36 female students.  Among the latter was [[Rebecca Gratz]] who would become an educator and philanthropist. However, the school soon began having financial problems and it reopened as an all-male institution.  [[Westford Academy]] in [[Westford, Massachusetts]] has operated as mixed-sex secondary school since its founding in 1792, making it the oldest continuously operating coed school in America.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.wickedlocal.com/westford/archive/x2136193253 |title=History of Westford Academy |last=Simmons |first=Carrie |date=7 September 2007 |work=Westford Eagle |accessdate=24 May 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110520013124/http://www.wickedlocal.com/westford/archive/x2136193253 |archivedate=20 May 2011 }}</ref> The oldest continuously operating coed boarding school in the United States is [[Cushing Academy]], founded in 1865.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cushing.org/page/about/cushing-history |title=History of Cushing Academy |date=1 January 2016 |work=Cushing News |accessdate=27 July 2018 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170606041052/https://www.cushing.org/page/about/cushing-history |archive-date=6 June 2017 }}</ref>

===Colleges===
{{Also|Oberlin College#History}}
A minister and a missionary founded Oberlin in 1833. Rev. [[John Jay Shipherd]] (minister) and Philo P. Stewart (missionary) became friends while spending the summer of 1832 together in nearby [[Elyria, Ohio|Elyria]]. They discovered a mutual disenchantment with what they saw as the lack of strong Christian principles among the settlers of the American West. They decided to establish a college and a colony based on their religious beliefs, "where they would train teachers and other Christian leaders for the boundless most desolate fields in the West".<ref name="new.oberlin.edu"/>

[[Oberlin College]] and the surrounding community were dedicated to progressive causes and social justice. Though it did reluctantly what every other college refused to do at all, it was the first college to admit both women and African Americans as students. Women were not admitted to the baccalaureate program, which granted bachelor's degrees, until 1837; prior to that, they received diplomas from what was called the Ladies' Course. The initial 1837 students were Caroline Mary Rudd, Elizabeth Prall, Mary Hosford, and Mary Fletcher Kellogg.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/4860900|title=Single-Sex Education VS Co-Education|website=www.academia.edu|access-date=2016-05-17}}</ref>

The early success and achievement of women at [[Oberlin College]] persuaded many early women's rights leaders that coeducation would soon be accepted throughout the country. However, for quite a while, women sometimes were treated rudely by their male classmates. The prejudice of some male professors proved more unsettling. Many professors disapproved of the admission of women into their classes, citing studies that claimed that women were mentally unsuited for higher education, and because most would "just get married"; they were using resources that, they believed, male students would use better. Some professors simply ignored the women students.<ref name="beatl.barnard.columbia" /> Even today, some books, studies, and other arguments claim that women and men learn very differently from each other because of their brain differences. One of these books is ''Boys and Girls Learn Differently!'', by Michael Gurian.<ref>{{cite book|last=Gurian|first=Michael|title=Boys and Girls Learn Differently!|year=2001|publisher=Jossey-Bass}}</ref>{{explain|date=September 2020}}

By the end of the 19th century 70% of American colleges were coeducational, although the state of Florida was a notable exception; the [[Buckman Act]] of 1905 imposed gender-separated white higher education at the [[University of Florida]] (men) and [[Florida Stste College for Women]]. (As there was only one state college for blacks, the future [[Florida A&M University]], it admitted both men and women.) The white Florida campuses returned to coeducation in 1947, when the women's college became [[Florida State University]] and the University of Florida becoming coeducational.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Kerber |first1=Stephen |title=William Edwards and the Historic University of Florida Campus: A Photographic Essay |journal=The Florida Historical Quarterly |date=January 1979 |volume=57 |issue=3 |pages=327–336 |jstor=30148527 }}</ref> In the late 20th century, many institutions of higher learning that had been exclusively for people of one sex became coeducational.

===Co-education fraternities===
{{main|List of social fraternities and sororities #Coeducational fraternities}}
A number of Greek-letter student societies have either been established (locally or nationally) or expanded as co-ed fraternities.

==="Coed" as slang===
In American colloquial language, "coed" or "co-ed" is used to refer to a mixed school.
The word is also often used to describe a situation in which both sexes are integrated in any form (e.g., "The team is coed"). As a noun, the word "coed" is used to refer to a female student in a mixed gender school.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/coed |title=Coed - Definition and More from the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-webster.com |date=2012-08-31 |accessdate=2013-09-16}}</ref> The noun use is considered sexist and unprofessional by those who argue that it implies that including women somehow transforms what is "normal" (male-only "education") into something different ("coeducation"):<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/lookinggoodcolle0000lowe |url-access=registration |quote=cornell. |author=Lowe, Margaret A.|title=Looking Good: College Women and Body Image, 1875-1930|page=[https://archive.org/details/lookinggoodcolle0000lowe/page/63 63] |publisher=Johns Hopkins UP |year=2003 |accessdate=2013-11-03|isbn=9780801882746}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://writingasjoe.blogspot.com/2006/09/dont-ever-call-my-daughter-coed.html |title=Don't Ever Call My Daughter a Coed|publisher=Writing as Jo(e)|date=2006-09-30  |accessdate=2013-11-03}}</ref> technically both male and female students at a coeducational institution should be considered "coeds".<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KY_XiQa5PhMC&q=%22coed+is%22&pg=PA132|author=Miller, Casey, and Kate Smith.|title=The Handbook of Nonsexist Writing |publisher=Lippincott & Crowell |date=2000 |accessdate=2017-04-14|isbn=9780595159215}}</ref> Numerous professional organizations require that the gender-neutral term "student" be used instead of "coed" or, when gender is relevant to the context, that the term "female student" be substituted.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.apaonline.org/?page=nonsexist |title=Guidelines for Non-Sexist Use of Language|publisher=Proceedings and Addresses of the American Philosophical Association (Vol. 59, Number 3, pp. 471-482) |date=February 1986 |accessdate=2013-11-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://cab-acr.ca/english/social/codes/guidelines_nonsexist.pdf |title=Guidelines for Non-Sexist Language |publisher=Canadian Association of Broadcasters |accessdate=2013-11-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ncte.org/positions/statements/genderfairuseoflang |title=Guidelines for Gender-Fair Use of Language |publisher=National Council of Teachers of English |date=June 2008 |accessdate=2013-11-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g0cnr5SaMm8C&q=coed+sexist+language&pg=PA407 |author1=Wilson, Kevin |author2=Jennifer Wauson |name-list-style=amp |title=Table 2.32: Biased Words and Their Alternatives.|work=The AMA Handbook of Business Writing.|page=407|publisher=American Management Association |year=2010 |accessdate=2013-11-03|isbn=9780814415894 }}</ref> Usage guides make no exception for any use of the noun to distinguish a female student at a coeducational institution from a student at a women-only institution: they do not even mention such use, possibly because such uses are comparatively rare and because the term cannot be distanced from its unacceptable uses.

==Effects of coeducation==
{{blockquote|If the sexes were educated together, we should have the healthy, moral and intellectual stimulus of sex ever quickening and refining all the faculties, without the undue excitement of senses that results from novelty in the present system of isolation.|[[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]]<ref name="beatl.barnard.columbia">{{cite web|last=Rosenberg |first=Rosalind |title=The History of Coeducation in America |url=http://beatl.barnard.columbia.edu/learn/documents/coeducation.htm |accessdate=24 October 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121222003458/http://beatl.barnard.columbia.edu/learn/documents/coeducation.htm |archivedate=22 December 2012 }}</ref>}}

For years, a question many educators, parents, and researchers have been asking is whether or not it is academically beneficial to teach boys and girls together or separately at school.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Guest|first1=Murray|title=Analysis and Research into Co-education in Australia and the UK|url=http://www.as.edu.au/content/uploads/2015/02/Final-Coeducation_Research_Paper_Feb_2015.pdf|publisher=The Armidale School|accessdate=2 January 2017|location=Armidale, NSW|date=2014}}</ref> Some argue that coeducation has primarily social benefits, allowing males and females of all ages to become more prepared for real-world situations, whereas a student that is only familiar with a single-sex setting could be less prepared, nervous, or uneasy.

However, some argue that at certain ages, students may be more distracted by the opposite sex in a coeducational setting, although others point out that this is based on the assumption that the students are all heterosexual, and evidence on the point is contradictory. There is evidence that girls may perform less well in traditionally male-dominated subjects such as the sciences when in a class with boys, although other research suggests that when the previous attainment is taken into account, this difference falls away.<ref>{{cite web |title=Do our views about co-ed versus single-sex schools hold up? |url=https://www.smh.com.au/lifestyle/life-and-relationships/do-our-views-about-co-ed-versus-single-sex-schools-hold-up-20180318-p4z4zq.html |website=The Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=3 December 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/women-in-leadership/2013/oct/30/co-educational-schools-bad-for-girls|first=Belinda|last=Palmar|title=Co-educational schools are bad for girls|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=30 October 2013|accessdate=10 June 2017}}</ref> According to advocates of coeducation, without classmates of the opposite sex, students have social issues that may impact adolescent development. They argue that the absence of the opposite sex creates an unrealistic environment not duplicated in the real world.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/education-news/why-single-sex-schools-are-bad-for-your-health-if-youre-a-boy-1831636.html|first=Richard|last=Garner|title=Why single-sex schools are bad for your health (if you're a boy)|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|date=1 December 2009|accessdate=10 June 2017}}</ref> Some studies show that in classes that are separated by gender, male and female students work and learn on the same level as their peers, the stereotypical mentality of the teacher is removed, and girls are likely to have more confidence in the classroom than they would in a coeducational class.<ref>Mael, F.
