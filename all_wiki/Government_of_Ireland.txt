{{Politics of the Republic of Ireland|Politics of Ireland}}
The '''Government of Ireland''' ({{lang-ga|Rialtas na hÉireann}}) is the [[cabinet (government)|cabinet]] that exercises [[executive (government)|executive authority]] in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]].

The [[Constitution of Ireland]] vests executive authority in a government which is headed by the {{lang|ga|[[Taoiseach]]|italic=no}}, the [[head of government]]. The government is composed of  ministers, all of whom must be members of the {{lang|ga|[[Oireachtas]]|italic=no}}, which consists of {{lang|ga|[[Dáil Éireann]]|italic=no}} and {{lang|ga|[[Seanad Éireann]]|italic=no}}. The Taoiseach must be [[Dáil vote for Taoiseach|nominated by the Dáil]], the house of representatives. Following the nomination of the {{lang|ga|Dáil|italic=no}}, the [[President of Ireland]] appoints the {{lang|ga|Taoiseach|italic=no}} to their role. The President also appoints members of the government, including the {{lang|ga|[[Tánaiste]]|italic=no}}, the deputy head of government, on the nomination of the {{lang|ga|Taoiseach|italic=no}} and their approval by the {{lang|ga|Dáil|italic=no}}. The government is dependent upon the Oireachtas to pass [[primary legislation]] and as such, the government needs to command a majority in the {{lang|ga|Dáil|italic=no}} in order to ensure support and confidence for budgets and government bills to pass. The Government is also known as the cabinet.

The [[Government of the 33rd Dáil|current government]] took office on 27 June 2020 with [[Micheál Martin]], leader of {{lang|ga|[[Fianna Fáil]]|italic=no}}, as {{lang|ga|[[Taoiseach]]|italic=no}}. The {{lang|ga|[[Tánaiste]]|italic=no}} is [[Leo Varadkar]], leader of {{lang|ga|[[Fine Gael]]|italic=no}}. It is a [[Coalition government|majority coalition]] government of {{lang|ga|Fianna Fáil|italic=no}}, {{lang|ga|Fine Gael|italic=no}} and the [[Green Party (Ireland)|Green Party]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.thejournal.ie/fianna-fail-leader-micheal-martin-has-been-elected-taoiseach-5133786-Jun2020/|title=Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin has been elected Taoiseach|publisher=[[TheJournal.ie]]|first=Cónal|last=Thomas|date=27 June 2020|accessdate=27 June 2020}}</ref> It was formed after protracted government negotiations following a [[2020 Irish general election|general election]] on 8 February 2020.

==Government==
Membership of the cabinet is regulated by Article 28 of the [[Constitution of Ireland]] and by the [[Ministers and Secretaries Acts|Ministers and Secretaries Acts 1924 to 2017]].<ref name="ministers act 1924">{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1924/en/act/pub/0016/sec0002.html |title=Ministers and Secretaries Act, 1924 (Section 2 – Ministers to be corporations sole and to have certain powers.)|publisher=Attorney General of Ireland |year=1924 |access-date=22 January 2011}}</ref> The Constitution requires the government to consist of between seven and fifteen members,<ref>[[Constitution of Ireland]], [[s:Constitution of Ireland#THE GOVERNMENT|Article 28.1]]</ref> all of whom must be a member of the [[Oireachtas]].

Since the formation of the [[12th Government of Ireland]] in 1966, all Irish cabinets have been formed with the constitutional maximum of fifteen ministers. The total sometimes falls below this number for brief periods following the resignation of individual ministers or the withdrawal of a party from a coalition.

No more than two members of the cabinet may be members of {{lang|ga|[[Seanad Éireann]]|italic=no}}.<ref>[[Constitution of Ireland]], [[s:Constitution of Ireland#THE GOVERNMENT|Article 28.2.2]].</ref> All other members of the cabinet must be members of [[Dáil Éireann]], the house of representatives. The [[Taoiseach]], Tánaiste and [[Minister for Finance (Ireland)|Minister for Finance]] must be members of the Dáil.<ref>[[Constitution of Ireland]], [[s:Constitution of Ireland#THE GOVERNMENT|Article 28.2.1]].</ref> In practice, however, the members of the cabinet are invariably members of the Dáil. Since the adoption of the 1937 constitution, only two ministers have been appointed from the Seanad: [[Seán Moylan]] who served in 1957 as [[Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine|Minister for Agriculture]] and [[James Dooge]] who served as [[Minister for Foreign Affairs (Ireland)|Minister for Foreign Affairs]] from 1981 to 1982.<ref name="otoole-dooney">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EeX4AwAAQBAJ&pg=PT9|title=Irish Government Today|page=9|author1-first=John|author1-last=O'Toole|author2-first=Sean|author2-last=Dooney|publisher=Gill & Macmillan Ltd|date=24 July 2009|isbn=9780717145522}}</ref> [[Joseph Connolly (Irish politician)|Joseph Connolly]], a member of the [[Seanad Éireann (Irish Free State)|Free State Seanad]], had served in the [[Executive Council of the Irish Free State]]<ref name="otoole-dooney" /> from 1932 to 1933 as [[Minister for Posts and Telegraphs]], and from 1933 to 1936 as [[Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications|Minister for Lands and Fisheries]].

Members of the government in charge of [[Department of State (Ireland)|Department of State]] are designated [[Minister (government)|Ministers of Government]] (before 1977 a Minister of State).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1977/act/28/section/4/enacted/en/html|title=Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) (No. 2) Act 1977 (Section 4 – Amendment of Interpretation Act 1937)|publisher=Attorney General of Ireland |year=1977 |accessdate=29 June 2020}}</ref> For distinction, [[Minister of State (Ireland)|Ministers of State]] (known before 1977 as [[parliamentary secretary|Parliamentary Secretaries]]) — informally called junior ministers — are not members of the Government, but assist the Government Ministers in their Departments. A [[minister without portfolio#Ireland|minister without portfolio]] may be appointed to the Government who is not the head of a Department of State; this occurred during the period known in Ireland as [[the Emergency (Ireland)|the Emergency]] when [[Frank Aiken]] served as [[Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures]] from 1939 until 1945.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1939/act/36/section/4/enacted/en/html|title=Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Act 1939 (Section 4 – Minister without portfolio) |publisher=Attorney General of Ireland |year=1939 |access-date=22 January 2011}}</ref> The functions of government ministers are [[Disused titles of Departments of State (Ireland)|frequently transferred between departments]] during [[cabinet reshuffle]]s or after elections. On occasion, a department of state will cease to exist, with its functions transferred to another department. Such defunct ministerial positions include the Ministers for [[Minister for Labour (Ireland)|Labour]], [[Minister for Posts and Telegraphs|Posts and Telegraphs]], [[Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport|Public Service]] and [[Minister for Supplies|Supplies]].

==Non-members attending cabinet==
Non-members have no voting rights at Cabinet but may otherwise participate fully, and normally receive circulated cabinet papers on the same basis as a full member of Government. Votes are rare, however, with the cabinet usually following the Taoiseach or working by consensus.

The Government is advised by the [[Attorney General of Ireland|Attorney General]], who is not formally a member of the Government, but who participates in cabinet meetings as part of their role as legal advisor to the Government.

The [[Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach|Chief Whip]] may attend meetings of the cabinet, but is not a member of the Government.<ref name=juniorministers>{{cite news |title=The Appointments |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2011/0311/1224291883382.html |newspaper=The Irish Times |date=11 March 2011 |accessdate=7 September 2011}}</ref> In addition, the Government can select other [[Minister of State (Ireland)|Ministers of State]] who may attend cabinet meetings. Up to three Ministers of State who regularly attend cabinet meetings may receive an allowance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2001/act/33/section/40/enacted/en/html|title=Ministerial, Parliamentary and Judicial Offices and Oireachtas Members (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2001, Section 40: Amendment of the 1998 Act — insertion of section 3A (allowances payable to certain Ministers of State)|website=Irish Statute Book|date=16 July 2001|accessdate=21 August 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2020/act/10/section/2/enacted/en/html|title=Ministers and Secretaries and Ministerial, Parliamentary, Judicial and Court Offices (Amendment) Act 2020, Section 2: Amendment of section 3A of Oireachtas (Allowances to Members) and Ministerial, Parliamentary, Judicial and Court Offices (Amendment) Act 1998|website=Irish Statute Book|date=2 August 2020|accessdate=21 August 2020}}</ref> This person is informally known as a "super junior minister".<ref name=juniorministers/> Currently [[Jack Chambers (politician)|Jack Chambers]], [[Hildegarde Naughton]] and [[Pippa Hackett]] are Ministers of State who attend cabinet.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rte.ie/news/newslens/2020/0702/1151020-government-cabinet-ministers/|title=The full list of ministers in the new government|publisher=[[RTÉ News and Current Affairs]]|date=2 July 2020|access-date=2 July 2020}}</ref> [[Trinity College Dublin]] law professor Oran Doyle has argued that this practice breaches [[Seventeenth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|cabinet confidentiality as required by the Constitution]].<ref>{{cite book|first=Oran|last=Doyle|date=2018|title=The Constitution of Ireland: A contextual analysis|publisher=Hart Publishing|pages=53–54|isbn=9781509903436}}</ref>

==Term of office==
A new government is formed by the Taoiseach appointed after each general election after receiving the [[Dáil vote for Taoiseach|nomination of the Dáil]]. All members of the government are deemed to have resigned on the resignation of the Taoiseach. Therefore, a new government is appointed where there is a new Taoiseach within a single Dáil term. The Constitution allows a Dáil term of no more than seven years, but a shorter period may be specified by law; this has been set as a maximum of five years. The Taoiseach may at any time advise the President to [[dissolution of parliament|dissolve]] the Dáil, prompting a new general election.<ref>[[Constitution of Ireland]], [[s:Constitution of Ireland#THE GOVERNMENT|Article 28.10]].</ref> The President retains an absolute discretion to refuse to grant a dissolution to a Taoiseach who has lost the confidence of the Dáil.<ref>[[Constitution of Ireland]], [[s:Constitution of Ireland#THE GOVERNMENT|Article 13.2.2º]].</ref> To date, no President has refused the request of a Taoiseach to dissolve the Dáil.

The Taoiseach must retain the confidence of Dáil Éireann to remain in office. If the Taoiseach ceases "to retain the support of a majority in Dáil Éireann", the Taoiseach must resign unless they seek a dissolution of the Dáil which is granted by the President. This applies only in cases of a [[Confidence motions in Dáil Éireann|motion of no confidence]] or loss of supply (rejection of a budget), rather than the defeat of the government in other legislation or Dáil votes.

The Taoiseach can direct the President to dismiss or accept the resignation of individual ministers. When the Taoiseach resigns, the entire Government is deemed to have resigned as a collective. However, in such a scenario, according to the Constitution, "the Taoiseach and the other members of the Government shall continue to carry on their duties until their successors shall have been appointed".

Upon the dissolution of Dáil Éireann, ministers are no longer members of the Oireachtas. However, the Constitution also provides that "the members of the Government in office at the date of a dissolution of Dáil Éireann shall continue to hold office until their successors shall have been appointed".<ref>[[Constitution of Ireland]], [[s:Constitution of Ireland#THE GOVERNMENT|Article 28.11]].</ref>

==Caretaker Government==
Where the resignation of the Taoiseach and government is not immediately followed by the appointment by the president of a new Taoiseach on the nomination of the Dáil, the outgoing government continues as a [[caretaker government]] to "carry out their duties until their successors have been appointed". This has happened when no candidate was nominated for Taoiseach when the Dáil first assembled after a general election, or, on one occasion, where a Taoiseach had lost the confidence of the Dáil, but there was not a dissolution of the Dáil followed by a general election.

==Authority and powers==
Unlike the cabinets in other parliamentary systems, the Government is both the {{lang|la|de jure}} and {{lang|la|de facto}} executive authority in Ireland. In some other parliamentary regimes, the head of state is the nominal chief executive, though bound by convention to act on the advice of the cabinet. In Ireland, however, the Constitution explicitly vests executive authority in the Government, not the President.

The executive authority of the Government is subject to certain limitations. In particular:
*The state may not [[Declaration of war|declare war]], or participate in a war, without the consent of the Dáil. In the case of "actual invasion", however, "the Government may take whatever steps they may consider necessary for the protection of the State".

Government ministers are collectively responsible for the actions of the government. Each minister is responsible for the actions of his or her department. Departments of State do not have legal personalities. Actions of departments are carried out under the title of ministers even, as is commonly the case, when the minister has little knowledge of the details of these actions. This contradicts the rule in [[common law]] that a person given a statutory power cannot delegate that power.<ref>{{cite BAILII|litigants= Devanney v. Shields|court= IEHC|year=1997|num=167|parallelcite =[1998] 1 IR 230; [1998] 1 ILRM 81|date = 31 October 1997|courtname=auto}}</ref> This leads to a phrase in correspondence by government departments, "the Minister has directed me to write", on letters or documents that the minister in question may never have seen.

If the Government, or any member of the government, should fail to fulfil its constitutional duties, it may be ordered to do so by a court of law, by a writ of {{lang|la|[[mandamus]]}}. Ministers who fail to comply may, ultimately, be found to be in [[contempt of court]], and even imprisoned.

==History==
Prior to independence, the executive of the [[unilateral declaration of independence|unilaterally declared]] [[Irish Republic]] was the [[Ministry of Dáil Éireann]]. This was in operation from 1919 to 1922. After the approval of the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]] in January 1922, a [[Provisional Government of Ireland (1922)|Provisional Government of Ireland]] was established as the executive. The personnel of the Provisional Government overlapped with the Ministry of Dáil Éireann, but they were not identical. On the independence of the [[Irish Free State]] on 6 December 1922, both executives were succeeded by the [[Executive Council of the Irish Free State]]. On 29 December 1937, on the coming into force of the Constitution of Ireland, the Eighth Executive Council of the Irish Free State became the [[Government of the 9th Dáil#1st Government of Ireland|First Government of Ireland]].

The detail and structure of the Government of Ireland has its legislative basis in the Ministers and Secretaries Act 1924; it has been amended on a number occasions, and these may be cited together as the [[Ministers and Secretaries Acts|Ministers and Secretaries Acts 1924 to 2017]] and are construed together as one Act.

All Governments from 1989 to 2016 were [[coalition government|coalitions]] of two or more parties. The first coalition government was formed in 1948. The Taoiseach has always been a member of the largest party in the coalition. The Taoiseach has almost always been the leader of that party, with [[John A. Costello]], Taoiseach from 1948 to 1951 and from 1954 to 1957, the only exception to this rule.

==Public service==
{{main|Public service of the Republic of Ireland}}
[[File:Gbuildings.jpg|thumb|[[Government Buildings]] in Dublin.]]

The public service in Ireland refers to the totality of [[public administration]] in Ireland. As of Q3, 2016 the total number of employees in the Irish public service stands at 304,472 people. The [[Department of Public Expenditure and Reform]] defines the public service as comprising seven sectors: the [[Civil service of the Republic of Ireland|Civil Service]], [[Irish Defence Forces|Defence Sector]], [[Education in the Republic of Ireland|Education Sector]], [[Healthcare in the Republic of Ireland|Health Sector]], [[Law enforcement in the Republic of Ireland|Justice Sector]], [[Local government in the Republic of Ireland|Local Authorities]] and [[State Agencies of the Republic of Ireland|Non-Commercial State Agencies]]; such as [[Bord Bia]], [[IDA Ireland]] and the [[Commission for Energy Regulation]].  Commercial [[State-sponsored bodies of the Republic of Ireland|state-owned bodies]] such as [[RTÉ]], [[ESB Group]] and [[An Post]] are not considered part of the public service in Ireland.

The largest sector is the health sector with over 105,000 employees (largely in the [[Health Service Executive]]), followed by the education sector with approximately 98,450.<ref>{{cite web|title=Department of Public Expenditure & Reform - Databank - Public Service Numbers|url=http://databank.per.gov.ie/Public_Service_Numbers.aspx?rep=SectorTrend|website=Department of Public Expenditure & Reform|accessdate=8 January 2017|ref=per_databank}}</ref>

===Civil service===
{{main|Civil service of the Republic of Ireland}}
The civil service of Ireland consists of two broad components, the ''Civil Service of the Government'' and the ''Civil Service of the State''. While this partition is largely theoretical, the two parts do have some fundamental operational differences. The civil service is expected to maintain political impartiality in its work, and some parts of it are entirely independent of Government decision making.
