'''Louisiana Creole''' or '''Kouri-Vini''' is a [[French-based creole languages|French-based creole]] language spoken by fewer than 10,000 people, mostly in the state of [[Louisiana]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=http://apics-online.info/contributions/53|title=APiCS Online -|website=apics-online.info|language=en|access-date=2017-08-15}}</ref> It is spoken today by people who racially identify as white, black, mixed, and Native American, as well as Cajun, Louisiana Creole, and African American, and should not be confused with its sister language, [[Louisiana French]], which is a dialect of the [[French language]]. Due to the rapidly shrinking number of speakers, Louisiana Creole is considered an [[endangered language]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ethnologue.com/language/lou|title=Louisiana Creole|work=Ethnologue|access-date=2017-08-15}}</ref>

==Origins and historical development==

Louisiana was colonized by French and Canadians in 1699.<ref name=":03">{{Cite journal|last=Klinger|first=Thomas A.|last2=Neumann-Holzschuh|first2=Ingrid|date=2013|editor-last=Michaelis|editor-first=Susanne Maria|editor2-last=Maurer|editor2-first=Phillippe|editor3-last=Haspelmath|editor3-first=Martin|editor4-last=Huber|editor4-first=Magnus|title=Louisiana Creole.|journal=The Survey of Pidgin and Creole Languages Volume II: Portuguese-based, Spanish-based, and French-based Languages.|location=UK|publisher=Oxford University Press|pages=229–40}}</ref> Colonists were large-scale planters, small-scale homesteaders, and cattle ranchers who had little success in enslaving the indigenous peoples who inhabited the area; the French needed laborers as they found the climate very harsh. They began to import African slaves, as they had for workers on their Caribbean island colonies.<ref name=":03" /> It is estimated that, beginning about 1719, a total of 5,500 persons were transported from the [[Senegambia]] region of West Africa. These people originally spoke a [[Mande language]] related to [[Malinke]]. They were in contact with slaves speaking other languages, such as [[Ewe language|Ewe]], [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]] and [[Kongo language|Kikongo]]. The importation of slaves by the French regime continued until 1743.<ref name=":03" />

Kouri-Vini developed in 18th century Louisiana from interactions among speakers of the lexifier language of [[Louisiana Creole people|Standard French and several substrate or adstrate languages from Africa]].<ref name=":13">{{Cite book|title=If I Could Turn My Tongue Like That: The Creole Language of Pointe Coupee parish, Louisiana.|last=Klinger|first=Thomas A.|publisher=Louisiana State University|year=2003|location=Louisiana|pages=3–92}}</ref><ref name=":03" /> Prior to its establishment as a Creole, the precursor was considered a [[pidgin]] language.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Dubois|first=Sylvie|last2=Melançon|first2=Megan|date=2000|title=Creole is, Creole Ain't: Diachronic and Synchronic Attitudes Toward Creole Identity in Southern Louisiana.|journal=Language in Society|volume=29|issue=2|pages=237–58|doi=10.1017/S0047404500002037}}</ref> The social situation that gave rise to the Louisiana Creole language was unique, in that the lexifier language was the language found at the contact site. More often the lexifier is the language that arrives at the contact site belonging to the substrate/adstrate languages. Neither the French, the French-Canadians, nor the African slaves were native to the area; this fact categorizes Louisiana Creole as a contact language that arose between exogenous ethnicities.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Pidgins, Creoles, & Mixed Languages|last=Velupillai|first=Viveka|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company.|year=2015|location=Amsterdam|pages=48–50}}</ref> Once the pidgin tongue was transmitted to the next generation as a ''lingua franca'' (who were considered the first native speakers of the new grammar), it could effectively be classified as a [[creole language]].<ref name=":13" /><ref name=":03" />

No standard name for the language exists historically. In the language, community members in various areas of Louisiana and elsewhere have referred to it in many expressions, though Kréyol/Kréyòl has been the most widespread of them. Until the rise of Cajunism in the 1970s and 1980s, many Louisiana Francophones also identified their language as Créole, since they self-identified as Louisiana Creoles. In Louisiana's case, self-identity has determined how locals identify the language they speak. This leads to linguistic confusion. To remedy this, language activists beginning in the 2010s began promoting Kouri-Vini, to avoid any linguistic ambiguity with Louisiana French.

The boundaries of historical Louisiana were first shaped by the French, then in statehood after 1812 took on its modern form. By the time of the [[Louisiana Purchase]] by the U.S in 1803, the boundaries came to include most of the Central U.S, ranging from present-day Montana; parts of North Dakota, Wyoming, Colorado; all of South Dakota, Nebraska, and Kansas; part of Southeast Texas; all of Oklahoma; most of Missouri and Arkansas; as well as Louisiana.<ref name=":23">{{Cite journal|last=Wendte|first=N.A|date=2018|title=Language and Identity Among Louisiana Creoles in Southeast Texas: Initial Observations.|journal=Southern Journal of Linguistics|volume=42|pages=1–16}}</ref>

In 1978, researchers located a document from a murder trial in the colonial period which acknowledges the existence of Louisiana Creole.<ref name=":03" /><ref name=":23" />  The documentation does not include any examples of orthography or structure.<ref name=":03" /><ref name=":23" />

In an 1807 document, a grammatical description of the language is included in the experiences of an enslaved woman recorded by C.C. Robin. This was prior to arrival in Louisiana of French-speaking colonists and enslaved Africans from Saint-Domingue; the whites and free people of color (also French speaking), were refugees from the [[Haitian Revolution]], that had established the second republic in the western hemisphere. The statements collected from Robin showed linguistic features that are now known to be typical of Louisiana Creole.<ref name=":03" />

The term “Criollo” appears in legal court documents during the Spanish colonial period (1762-1803); the Spanish reference to the language stated that the language was used among slaves and whites.<ref name=":23" />

Slavery of Africans intensified after France ceded the colony to Spain in 1763, following France's defeat by Great Britain in the Seven Years' War in Europe.<ref>"Seven Years War." The Columbia Encyclopedia, Paul Lagasse, and Columbia University, Columbia University Press, 8th edition, 2018. Credo Reference,</ref> Some Spaniards immigrated to the colony, but it was dominated by French language and culture. Like South Carolina, Louisiana had a "minority" population of Africans that greatly outnumbered the European settlers, including those white Creoles born in the colony.<ref name=":03" />

==Language shift, endangerment and revitalization==
In the case of Louisiana Creole, a ''[[diglossia]]'' resulted between Louisiana Creole and Louisiana French. Michael Picone, a lexicographer, proposed the term "Plantation Society French" to describe a version of French which he associated with plantation owners, plantation overseers, small landowners, military officers/soldiers and bilingual, [[free people of color]], as being a contributor to Louisiana Creole's lexical base. Over the centuries, Louisiana Creole's negative associations with slavery stigmatized the language to the point where many speakers are reluctant to use it for fear of ridicule. In this way, the assignment of "high" variety (or H language) was allotted to standard Louisiana French and that of "low" variety (or L language) was given to Louisiana Creole and to Louisiana French (please refer to [[diglossia]] for more information on H and L languages).<ref name="Carlisle">{{cite web|last1=Carlisle|first1=Aimee Jeanne|title=Language Attrition in Louisiana Creole French|url=http://linguistics.ucdavis.edu/pics-and-pdfs/Honors%20Thesis%20Aimee%20Carlisle.pdf|website=linguistics.ucdavis.edu|publisher=University of California, Davis|accessdate=March 27, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160910072001/http://linguistics.ucdavis.edu/pics-and-pdfs/Honors%20Thesis%20Aimee%20Carlisle.pdf|archive-date=September 10, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The social status of Louisiana Creole further declined as a result of the [[Louisiana Purchase]]. Americans and their government made it illegal for Louisiana Creoles to speak their language. Public institutions like schools refused to teach children in their native tongue and children and adults were often punished by corporal punishment, fines, and social degradation. By the 21st century, other methods were enforced. The promise of upward socioeconomic mobility and [[public humiliation|public shaming]] did the rest of the work, prompting many speakers of Louisiana Creole to abandon their stigmatised language in favor of English.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Brown|first1=Becky|title=The Social Consequences of Writing Louisiana French|date=March 1993|publisher=Cambridge University Press|pages=68–92}}</ref> Additionally, the development of industry, technology and infrastructure in Louisiana reduced the isolation of Louisiana Creolophone communities and resulted in the arrival of more English-speakers, resulting in further exposure to English. Because of this, Louisiana Creole exhibits more recent influence from English, including [[loanword]]s, [[code-switching]] and [[Calque|syntactic calquing]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Valdman|first1=ed. by Albert|title=French and Creole in Louisiana|date=1997|publisher=Plenum Press|location=New York [u.a.]|isbn=0-306-45464-5|page=111}}</ref><ref name=":1" /><ref name=":4">{{Cite book|title=Le créole de Breaux Bridge, Louisiane: étude morphosyntaxique, textes, vocabulaire|last=Neumann|first=Ingrid|publisher=Helmut Buske Verlag|year=1985|isbn=9783871186974|location=Hamburg}}</ref>

Today, Louisiana Creole is spoken by fewer than 10,000 people.<ref name=":0" /> Though national census data includes figures on language usage, these are often unreliable in Louisiana due to respondents' tendencies to identify their language in line with their ethnic identity. For example, speakers of Louisiana Creole who identify as [[Cajuns]] often label their language 'Cajun French', though on linguistic grounds their language would be considered Louisiana Creole.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Klingler|first=Thomas A.|date=2003|title=Language labels and language use among Cajuns and Creoles in Louisiana|url=http://repository.upenn.edu/pwpl/vol9/iss2/8/|journal=University of Pennsylvania Working Papers in Linguistics|volume=9|issue=2}}</ref>

Efforts to revitalize French in Louisiana have placed emphasis on ''[[Cajun French]]'', to the exclusion of Creole.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Squint|first=Kirstin L.|date=2005-05-04|title=A Linguistic Comparison of Haitian Creole and Louisiana Creole|url=http://postcolonial.org/index.php/pct/article/view/375|journal=Postcolonial Text|language=en|volume=1|issue=2}}</ref> A small number of community organisations focus on promoting Louisiana Creole, for example CREOLE, Inc.<ref>{{Cite web|title=CREOLE, Inc.|url=http://louisianacreoleinc.org/|access-date=2020-10-10|website=CREOLE, Inc.|language=en-US}}</ref> and the 'Creole Table' founded by Velma Johnson.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.louisianacreoleinc.org/about-us.html|title=About Us|website=www.louisianacreoleinc.org|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-11-05}}</ref> In addition, there is an active online community of language-learners and activists engaged in language revitalization, led by [[language activist]] Christophe Landry.<ref>Mayeux, Oliver. 2015.

==Geographic distribution==
Speakers of Louisiana Creole are mainly concentrated in south and southwest Louisiana, where the population of Creolophones is distributed across the region. [[St. Martin Parish, Louisiana|St. Martin Parish]] forms the heart of the Creole-speaking region. Other sizeable communities exist along [[Bayou Teche|Bayou Têche]] in [[St. Landry Parish, Louisiana|St. Landry]], [[Avoyelles Parish, Louisiana|Avoyelles]], [[Iberia Parish, Louisiana|Iberia]], and [[St. Mary Parish, Louisiana|St. Mary]] Parishes. There are smaller communities on [[False River (Louisiana)|False River]] in [[Pointe Coupee Parish, Louisiana|Pointe-Coupée Parish]], in [[Terrebonne Parish, Louisiana|Terrebone Parish]], and along the lower Mississippi River in [[Ascension Parish, Louisiana|Ascension]], [[St. Charles Parish, Louisiana|St. Charles Parish]], and [[St. James Parish, Louisiana|St. James]] and [[St. John the Baptist Parish, Louisiana|St. John the Baptist]] parishes.<ref>Kirstin Squint, [http://postcolonial.org/index.php/pct/article/viewArticle/375/813 A Linguistic and Cultural Comparison of Haitian Creole and Louisiana Creole], postcolonial.org, Accessed March 11, 2014</ref>

There once were Creolophones in Natchitoches Parish on [[Cane River]] and sizable communities of Louisiana Creole-speakers in adjacent [[Southeast Texas]] ([[Beaumont, Texas|Beaumont]], [[Houston, Texas|Houston]], [[Port Arthur, Texas|Port Arthur]], [[Galveston, Texas|Galveston]])<ref name=":23" /><ref>{{Cite book|last=Wendte|first=N.A.|title="Creole" – a Louisiana Label in a Texas Context|publisher=Lulu|year=2020|isbn=9781716647567}}</ref> and the [[Chicago]] area. Louisiana Creole speakers in California reside in [[Los Angeles County, California|Los Angeles]], [[San Diego County, California|San Diego]] and [[San Bernardino County, California|San Bernardino]] counties and in Northern California ([[San Francisco Bay Area]], [[Sacramento County, California|Sacramento County]], [[Plumas County, California|Plumas County]], [[Tehama County, California|Tehama County]], [[Mono County, California|Mono County]], and [[Yuba County, California|Yuba County]]).<ref name=":1">{{Cite book|last=A.|first=Klingler, Thomas|title=If I could turn my tongue like that : the Creole language of Pointe Coupee Parish, Louisiana|date=2003|publisher=Louisiana State University Press|isbn=0807127795|location=Baton Rouge|oclc=846496076}}</ref> Historically, there were Creole-speaking communities in Mississippi and Alabama (on [[Mon Louis Island]]), however it is likely that no speakers remain in these areas.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Marshall|first=Margaret|date=1991|title=The Creole of Mon Louis Island, Alabama, and the Louisiana Connection|journal=Journal of Pidgin and Creole Languages|volume=6|pages=73–87|doi=10.1075/jpcl.6.1.05mar}}</ref>

==Phonology==
The phonology of Louisiana Creole has much in common with those of other [[French-based creole languages]]. In comparison to most of these languages, however, Louisiana Creole diverges less from the [[French phonology|phonology of French]] in general and [[Louisiana French]] in particular.

The table above shows the oral and nasal vowels of Louisiana Creole as identified by linguists.<ref name=":03" />

==== Vowel rounding ====
Speakers of the language may use rounded vowels [y], [ø] and [œ] where they occur in French. This is subject to a high degree of [[Variation (linguistics)|variation]] with the same region, sociolinguistic group, and even within the same speaker.<ref name=":4" /><ref name=":1" /><ref name=":6">{{Cite thesis|title=Rethinking decreolization: Language contact and change in Louisiana Creole|url=https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/handle/1810/294526|publisher=University of Cambridge|date=2019-07-19|degree=PhD|doi=10.17863/cam.41629|language=en|first=Oliver|last=Mayeux}}</ref> Examples of this process include:

* /diri/~/dyri/ 'rice', compare French ''du riz'' /dyri/
* /vje/~/vjø/ 'old', compare French ''vieux'' /vjø/
* /ʤɛl/~/ʤœl/ 'mouth', compare French ''gueule'' /gœl/<ref name=":7" />

==== Vowel lowering ====
The [[open-mid vowel]] [ɛ] may lowered to the near-open vowel [æ] when followed by [ɾ], e.g. [fɾɛ]~[fɾæɾ] 'brother'.<ref name=":03" />

==== Regressive and progressive nasalization of vowels ====
In common with [[Louisiana French]], Louisiana Creole vowels are [[Nasalization|nasalized]] where they precede a [[nasal consonant]], e.g. [ʒɛ̃n] 'young' [pɔ̃m] 'apple'. Unlike most varieties of Louisiana French, Louisiana Creole also exhibits progressive nasalization: vowels following a nasal consonant are nasalized, e.g. [kɔ̃nɛ̃] 'know'.<ref name=":8">{{Cite book|last=Klingler|first=Thomas A.|title=Language in Louisiana: Community and Culture|date=2019-08-01|publisher=University Press of Mississippi|isbn=978-1-4968-2386-1|editor-last=Dajko|editor-first=Nathalie|pages=95|chapter=The Louisiana Creole Language Today|doi=10.2307/j.ctvkwnnm1.14|editor-last2=Walton|editor-first2=Shana|jstor=j.ctvkwnnm1}}</ref>

==Grammar==
Louisiana Creole exhibits [[subject-verb-object]] (SVO) word order.<ref name=":1" /> 

=== Determiners ===
In ninteenth century sources, determiners in Louisiana Creole appear  related to [[Specificity (linguistics)|specificity]]. [[Bare nouns]] are non-specific. As for specific nouns, if the noun is pre-supposed it took a definite determiner (''-la'', singular; ''-la-ye'', plural) or by an indefinite determiner (''en,'' singular; ''de'' or ''-ye'', plural). Today, [[definite articles]] in Louisiana Creole vary between the ''le'', ''la'' and ''lê'', placed before the noun as in [[Louisiana French]], and [[Preposition and postposition|post-positional]] definite determiners -''la'' for the singular, and -''yé'' for the plural.<ref name=":3" /> This variation is but one example of the influence of [[Louisiana French]] on Louisiana Creole, especially in the variety spoken along the [[Bayou Teche|Bayou Têche]] which has been characterized by some linguists as [[Decreolization|decreolized]], though this notion is controversial.<ref name=":4" /><ref name=":1" /><ref name=":3" /> 

Some speakers of that variety display a highly variable system of [[Grammatical number|number]] and [[Grammatical gender|gender]] [[Agreement (linguistics)|agreement]], as evidenced in [[possessive]] [[pronoun]]s.<ref name=":6" />

==== Personal pronouns<ref name=":3" /> ====

[[Possession (linguistics)|Possession]] is shown by noun-noun possessum-possessor constructions (e.g. ''lamézon mô papa''  'house (of) my grandfather') or with the preposition ''a'' (e.g. ''lamézon a mô papa'' 'house of my grandfather').<ref name=":3" /> 

=== Verbs ===

==== Verbal morphology ====
Older forms of Louisiana Creole featured only one form of each verb without any [[inflection]], e.g. [mɑ̃ʒe] 'to eat'. Today, the language typically features two verb classes: verbs with only a single form ([bwɑ] 'to drink') and verbs with a 'long' or 'short' form ([mɑ̃ʒe], [mɑ̃ʒ] 'to eat').<ref name=":03" />

==== Tense, aspect, mood ====
Like other creole languages, Louisiana Creole features preverbal markers of [[Tense–aspect–mood|tense, aspect and mood]] as listed in the table below

==Vocabulary==
The vocabulary of Louisiana Creole is of primarily of French origin, as French is the language's [[lexifier]]. Some local vocabulary, such as topography, animals, plants are of [[Amerindian]] origin. In the domains [[folklore]] and [[Louisiana Voodoo|Voodoo]], the language has a small number of vocabulary items from west and central African languages.<ref name=":7">Albert Valdman, ''Dictionary of Louisiana Creole,''  Indiana University Press, 1998, pp. 3-4.</ref> Much of this non-French vocabulary is shared with other [[French-based creole languages]] of North America, and Louisiana Creole shares all but a handful of its vocabulary with [[Louisiana French]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=New Orleans and the global South : Caribbean, Creolization, carnival|last=Neumann-Holzschuh|first=Ingrid|publisher=Georg-Olms-Verlag AG|year=2016|isbn=978-3487155043|editor-last=Ette|editor-first=Ottmar|location=Hildesheim|chapter=Entre la Caraïbe et l'Amérique du Nord: le créole louisianais et son lexique à la lumière de ses contacts linguistiques et culturels|oclc=973171332|editor-last2=Müller|editor-first2=Gesine}}</ref>

===The Lord's Prayer===
Catholic prayers are recited in French by speakers of Kouri-Vini. Today, efforts are being led by various language activists and learners to translate the prayers in Kouri-Vini.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_HGizbHH7M |title=Nouzòt Popá (The Our Father in Louisiana Creole)| author=Christophe Landry | website=Youtube | year=2012}}</ref>{{Unreliable source?|date=July 2020}}

Nouzòt Popá, ki dan syèl-la<br />

t'olé dan syèl; parèy si latær<br />
Donné-nou jordi dipin tou-lé-jou,<br />
é pardon nouzòt péshé paréy nou pardon<br /> 
lê moun ki fé nouzòt sikombé tentasyon-la,<br />
Mé délivré nou depi mal.
