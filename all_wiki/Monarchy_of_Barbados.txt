{{Politics of Barbados}}

The '''monarch of Barbados''' is the [[sovereign]] and [[head of state]] of [[Barbados]]. The current Barbadian monarch and [[Head of state#Governors-general (Commonwealth realms)|head of state]], since the independence of Barbados on 30 November 1966, is [[Queen Elizabeth II]]. As the sovereign, she is the personal embodiment of the Barbadian [[The Crown|Crown]]. Although the person of the sovereign is [[Personal union|equally shared]] with [[Commonwealth realm|15 other independent countries]] within the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], each country's monarchy is separate and legally distinct. As a result, the current monarch is officially titled ''Queen of Barbados'' and, in this capacity, she, her husband, and other members of the Royal Family undertake public and private functions domestically and abroad{{cn|date=September 2020}} as representatives of the Barbadian state. However, the Queen is the only member of the Royal Family with any [[constitution]]al role. The Queen lives in the United Kingdom and, while several powers are the sovereign's alone, most of the royal governmental and ceremonial duties in Barbados are carried out by the Queen's representative, the [[Governor-General of Barbados|governor-general]].{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

Some of the powers of the Crown are exercisable by the monarch (such as appointing governors-general) and others by the governor-general (such as calling parliamentary elections). Further, the [[royal sign-manual]] is required for [[letters patent]] and [[Order in Council|orders in council]]. But, the authority for these acts stems from the Barbadian populace and, within the [[Convention (norm)#Government|conventional]] stipulations of [[constitutional monarchy]], the sovereign's direct participation in any of these areas of governance is limited, with most related powers entrusted for exercise (via advice or direction to the monarch or the viceroy) by the elected and appointed [[Parliament of Barbados|parliamentarians]], the [[Minister of the Crown|ministers of the Crown]] generally drawn from amongst them, and the [[Judiciary of Barbados|judges]] and [[Justice of the peace|justices of the peace]]. The Crown today primarily functions as a guarantor of continuous and stable governance and a [[nonpartisan]] safeguard against the abuse of power.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

The historical roots of the Barbadian monarchy date back to approximately the early 17th century, when [[King James VI and I]] made the first English claims to Barbados. Monarchical governance thenceforth evolved under a continuous succession of British sovereigns and eventually the Barbadian monarchy of today.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

==International and domestic aspects==
{{Further|Commonwealth realm#Relationship of the realms}}
[[File:Commonwealth Realms map2.png|thumb|right|Map of the Commonwealth realms]]

The person who is the Barbadian sovereign is [[Personal union|equally shared]] with 15 other monarchies (a grouping, including Barbados, known informally as the [[Commonwealth realm]]s) in the 52-member [[Commonwealth of Nations]], with the monarch residing predominantly in the oldest and most populous realm, the United Kingdom, and a [[viceroy]]—the [[Governor-General of Barbados]]—acting as the sovereign's representative in Barbados. This arrangement emerged among the older realms after the end of the [[World War I|First World War]] and is governed by the [[Statute of Westminster 1931]]. Since then, the pan-national Crown has had both a shared and a separate character and the sovereign's role as monarch of Barbados has been, since Barbados' independence in 1966, distinct to his or her position as monarch of any other realm, including the United Kingdom.{{#tag:ref|The [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|English Court of Appeal]] ruled in 1982, while "there is only one person who is the Sovereign within the British Commonwealth... in matters of law and government the Queen of the United Kingdom, for example, is entirely independent and distinct from the Queen of Canada."<ref>{{cite court| litigants=R v Foreign Secretary, Ex parte Indian Association (as referenced in High Court of Australia: Sue v Hill [1999] HCA 30; 23 June 1999; S179/1998 and B49/1998)| vol=QB 892 at 928| court=English Court of Appeal| date=June 1999| url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1999/30.html}}</ref>|group=n|name=ECApp}}<ref name=Buck1>{{cite web| url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/output/Page4928.asp| author=Royal Household| title=The Queen and Commonwealth > Other Caribbean Realms| publisher=Queen's Printer}}</ref> Only Barbadian [[Minister of the Crown|ministers of the Crown]] may advise the sovereign on matters of the Barbadian state.<ref name=Buck1/> The monarchy thus ceased to be an exclusively British institution and in Barbados became a Barbadian, or "domesticated",<ref>{{Cite journal| last=Mallory| first=J.R.| title=Seals and Symbols: From Substance to Form in Commonwealth Equality| journal=The Canadian Journal of Economics and Political Science| volume=22| issue=3| pages=281–291| publisher=Blackwell Publishing| location=Montreal| date=August 1956| jstor=138434| issn=0008-4085}}</ref> establishment.
[[File:Royal Standard of Barbados.svg|thumb|left|The [[Queen's Personal Barbadian Flag]]]]

This division is illustrated in a number of ways: The sovereign, for example, holds [[List of titles and honours of Queen Elizabeth II#Americas|a unique Barbadian title]] and, when she is acting in public specifically as a representative of Barbados, she will use, where possible, Barbadian symbols, including the country's [[Flag of Barbados|national flag]], [[#Symbols|unique royal symbols]], and the like. The sovereign similarly only draws from Barbadian coffers for support in the performance of her duties when in Barbados or acting as Queen of Barbados abroad; Barbadians do not pay any money to the Queen, either towards personal income or to support royal residences outside of Barbados. This applies equally to other members of the Royal Family. Normally, tax dollars pay only for the costs associated with the governor-general in the exercise of the powers of the Crown, including travel, security, residences, offices, and ceremonies.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

A claim made by supporters of the monarchy is that it "keeps the line of stability open";<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.anglicanchurchworldwide.org/Barbados.html| author=Anglican Church Worldwide| title=Barbados| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515025435/http://www.anglicanchurchworldwide.org/Barbados.html| archive-date=15 May 2013| df=dmy-all}}</ref> the sovereign's usual location outside the country means legitimate executive power would be unaffected by any hostile invasion of Barbados or other event that rendered the [[Table of precedence for Barbados|entire sitting government]] incapacitated or unable to function.<ref>{{citation| url=http://www.oas.org/dil/The_Constitution_of_Barbados.pdf| author=Elizabeth II| title=Constitution of Barbados| page=37| id=IV.29(1a), (1b), (1c)| place=Bridgetown| year=2002| publisher=Government Printer| accessdate=3 May 2015}}</ref> Such a situation has not arisen; however, it may have helped if the [[Operation Red Dog]]-invasion plot, which targeted the [[Commonwealth of Dominica]] and likely Barbados,<ref name=Nation>{{cite news| url=http://www.nationnews.com/Politics/26973.htm| title=Tull: Tell us about coup rumours| first=C| last=A| date=4 October 2006| newspaper=Nation Newspaper| accessdate=4 October 2009| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306065519/http://www.nationnews.com/Politics/26973.htm| archive-date=6 March 2012| url-status=dead| df=dmy-all}}</ref> was not halted.{{#tag:ref|During the 1990 [[Jamaat al Muslimeen coup attempt]] in nearby [[Trinidad and Tobago]], all branches of government were successfully captured on the island, leading to the president and cabinet having to sign an amnesty to return toward governance.|group=n|name=Trin}}

===Succession===
{{Further|Succession to the Barbadian throne}}
By [[Constitutional convention (political custom)|convention]], succession in Barbados is deferred to the laws of the United Kingdom; whoever is monarch of the UK is automatically also monarch of Barbados. [[Succession to the British throne|Succession in Britain]] is, for those born before 28 October 2011, by [[Primogeniture|male-preference primogeniture]] and, for people born after 28 October 2011, by [[Primogeniture#Absolute primogeniture|absolute primogeniture]], governed by [[common law]], the [[Act of Settlement 1701]], [[Bill of Rights 1689]], and [[Succession to the Crown Act 2013]]. This legislation limits the succession to the natural (i.e. non-[[adoption|adopted]]), legitimate descendants of [[Sophia of Hanover|Sophia, Electress of Hanover]], and stipulates that the monarch cannot be a [[Roman Catholic]] and must be in communion with the [[Church of England]] upon ascending the throne. Though these laws still lie within the control of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|British parliament]], the United Kingdom agreed, via adopting the Statute of Westminster, not to change the rules of succession without the unanimous consent of the other realms, unless explicitly leaving the shared monarchy relationship.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.parliament.uk/edm/2004-05/895| title=Early day motion 895: MORGANATIC MARRIAGE AND THE STATUTE OF WESTMINSTER 1931| first=Andrew| last=Mackinlay| date=10 Mar 2005| publisher=British Parliament| location=London| accessdate=5 November 2011}}</ref> This situation that applies [[Symmetry|symmetrically]] in all the other realms and has been likened to a [[treaty]] among these countries.{{#tag:ref|Justice Rouleau in a 2003 [[O'Donohue v.

[[File:Charles, Prince of Wales.jpg|thumb|left|[[Charles, Prince of Wales]], the [[heir apparent]] to the Barbadian throne]]

Upon a [[demise of the Crown]] (the death or abdication of a sovereign), the late sovereign's heir immediately and automatically succeeds, without any need for confirmation or further ceremony; hence arises the phrase "[[The King is dead. Long live the King!]]" Following an appropriate period of [[mourning]], the monarch is also [[coronation of the British monarch|crowned]] in the United Kingdom, though this ritual is not necessary for a sovereign to reign; for example, [[Edward VIII]] was never crowned, yet was undoubtedly king during his short time on the throne. All incumbent [[viceroy]]s, judges, [[National Union of Public Workers|civil servants]], legislators, military officers, etc., are not affected by the death of the monarch. After an individual ascends the throne, he or she typically continues to reign until death. Monarchs are not allowed to unilaterally abdicate; the only monarch to abdicate, Edward VIII, did so before Barbados was independent and, even then, only with the authorization of the governments of the United Kingdom and the then [[Dominion]]s and special [[Act of Parliament|Acts of Parliament]] in each, as well as the UK.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

==Personification of the state==
Today the sovereign is regarded as the personification, or legal personality, of the Barbadian [[Sovereign state|state]]. Therefore, the state is referred to as ''Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Barbados''; the state is referred to as such, or simply ''[[Queen regnant|Regina]]'', if a lawsuit is filed against the government. The monarch, in his or her position as sovereign, and not as an individual, is thus the owner of all state lands (called ''[[Crown land]]''), buildings and equipment (called ''Crown held property''), state-owned companies (called ''statutory bodies'' or ''[[Crown Corporation]]s''), and the [[copyright]] for all government publications (called ''[[Crown copyright]]''), as well as guardianship of foster children (called ''[[Crown ward]]s''). Government staff (the [[Civil Service]]) are also employed by the monarch, as are the governor-general, judges, members of the [[Barbados Defence Force]], [[police]] officers, and [[Parliament of Barbados|parliamentarians]]. Hence, many employees of the Crown are required by law to recite an [[oath of allegiance]] to the monarch before taking their posts, in [[reciprocity (social and political philosophy)|reciprocation]] to the sovereign's [[Coronation]] Oath, wherein he or she promises "to govern the Peoples of... [Barbados]... according to their respective laws and customs".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oremus.org/liturgy/coronation/cor1953b.html|title=The Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II}}</ref> The oath required by the Director of Public Prosecutions, for example, is: "I, [name], do swear that I will well and truly serve Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, Her Heirs and Successors, in the office of Director of Public Prosecutions. So help me God", while that for judges is: "I, [name], do swear that I will well and truly serve Our Sovereign Lady Queen Elizabeth II, Her Heirs and Successors, in the office of Chief Justice/Judge of the Supreme Court and I will do right to all manner of people after the laws and usages of Barbados without fear or favour, affection or ill will. so help me God."<ref>[http://www.barbados.gov.bb/bdsconst_first_schedule.htm Constitution of Barbados; First Schedule] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705025347/http://www.barbados.gov.bb/bdsconst_first_schedule.htm |date=5 July 2008 }}</ref>

==Constitutional role==
[[File:Simplification of govt structure of Barbados.gif|thumb|right|300px|A simplified diagram of the Barbados government]]
[[Constitution of Barbados|Barbados' constitution]] gives the country a similar parliamentary system of government to the other Commonwealth realms, wherein the role of the monarch and governor-general is both legal and practical, but not political. The Crown is regarded as a corporation, in which several parts share the authority of the whole, with the sovereign as the person at the centre of the constitutional construct,<ref name=Murdoch>[http://www.murdoch.edu.au/elaw/issues/v9n3/cox93.html Cox, Noel; ''Murdoch University Electronic Journal of Law'': Black v Chrétien: Suing a Minister of the Crown for Abuse of Power, Misfeasance in Public Office and Negligence; Volume 9, Number 3 (September 2002)]</ref> meaning all powers of state are constitutionally reposed in the monarch. The constitution requires most of the Queen's domestic duties to be performed by the governor-general, appointed by the monarch on the advice of the [[Prime Minister of Barbados]].<ref name="Elizabeth II 2002 loc=IV.28">{{harvnb| Elizabeth II| 2002| loc=IV.28}}</ref>

All institutions of government are said to act under the sovereign's authority; the vast powers that belong to the Crown are collectively known as the [[Royal Prerogative]]. Parliamentary approval is not required for the exercise of the Royal Prerogative; moreover, the consent of the Crown must be obtained before either of the houses of parliament may even debate a bill affecting the sovereign's prerogatives or interests. While the Royal Prerogative is extensive, it is not unlimited; for example, the monarch does not have the prerogative to impose and collect new taxes—such an action requires the authorization of an [[Act of Parliament]]. The government of Barbados is also thus formally referred to as ''[[Politics of Barbados|Her Majesty's Government]]''. Further, the constitution instructs that any change to the position of the monarch, or the monarch's representative in Barbados, requires the consent of two-thirds of the all the members of each house of parliament.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

===Executive (Queen-in-Council)===
One of the main duties of the Crown is to appoint a [[prime minister]], who thereafter heads the [[Cabinet of Barbados|Cabinet]] and [[Advice (constitutional)|advises the monarch or governor-general]] on how to execute their executive powers over all aspects of government operations and foreign affairs. Though the monarch's power is still a part of the executive process—the operation of the Cabinet is technically known as the ''[[Queen-in-Council]]'' (or ''Governor-in-Council'')—the advice tendered is typically binding; the requirement of the governor-general to follow ministerial (either generally or specifically the prime minister's) advice is constitutionally enshrined in Barbados,<ref>{{harvnb| Elizabeth II| 2002| loc=IV.32(1)}}</ref> unlike in other Commonwealth realms, where it is a matter of convention.. Since the death of [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] in 1714, the last monarch to head the [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|British Cabinet]], the monarch ''reigns'' but does not ''rule''. This means that the monarch's, and thereby the viceroy's, role is almost entirely symbolic and cultural, acting as a symbol of the legal authority under which all governments and agencies operate, while the Cabinet directs the use of the Royal Prerogative, which includes the privilege to declare war, maintain the [[Queen's peace]], and direct the actions of the [[Barbados Defence Force]], as well as to [[Parliamentary session|summon and prorogue parliament]] and [[Dropping the writ|call elections]]. However, it is important to note that the Royal Prerogative belongs to the Crown and not to any of the ministers, though it may sometimes appear that way,<ref name=Murdoch/> and the constitution allows the governor-general to unilaterally use these powers in relation to the dismissal of a prime minister, dissolution of parliament, and removal of a judge in exceptional, [[constitutional crisis]] situations.<ref>{{harvnb| Elizabeth II| 2002| loc=IV.32(2)}}</ref> There are also a few duties which must be specifically performed by, or bills that require assent by, the Queen. These include appointing the governor-general,<ref name="Elizabeth II 2002 loc=IV.28"/> the creation of [[Commonwealth realms orders and decorations#Barbados|Barbadian honours]], and the approval of any change in her Barbadian title.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}
[[File:Government House, Government Hill, Barbados-001.jpg|thumb|right|[[Government House, Barbados|Government House]], the residence of the monarch and governor-general of Barbados]]

The governor-general, to maintain the stability of government, must appoint as prime minister the individual most likely to maintain the support of the [[Barbados House of Assembly|House of Assembly]];<ref>{{harvnb| Elizabeth II| 2002| loc=VI.65(1)}}</ref> usually this is the leader of the [[List of political parties in Barbados|political party]] with a majority in that house, but also, when no party or coalition holds a majority (referred to as a [[minority government]] situation), or other scenarios in which the governor-general's judgement about the most suitable candidate for prime minister has to be brought into play. The governor-general must additionally appoint to Cabinet, at the direction of the prime minister, at least five other [[Minister of the Crown|ministers of the Crown]].<ref>{{harvnb| Elizabeth II| 2002| loc=VI.64(1)}}</ref> All ministers are accountable to the democratically elected House of Assembly and, through it, to the people. The Queen is informed by her viceroy of the acceptance of the resignation of a prime minister and the swearing-in of a new prime minister and other members of the ministry, she remains fully briefed through regular communications from her Barbadian ministers, and she holds audience with them where possible.<ref name=Buck1/> Members of various executive agencies and other officials are appointed by the Crown. The commissioning of privy councillors, [[Senate of Barbados|senators]], the Speaker of the Senate, and [[Politics of Barbados#Judiciary|Supreme Court]] justices also falls under the Royal Prerogative. [[Public inquiries]] are also commissioned by the Crown through a [[Royal warrant (document)|Royal Warrant]] and are called ''[[Royal Commission]]s''.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

The Royal Prerogative further extends to foreign affairs: the governor-general ratifies treaties, alliances, and international agreements. As with other uses of the Royal Prerogative, no parliamentary approval is required. However, a treaty cannot alter the domestic laws of Barbados; an Act of Parliament is necessary in such cases. The governor-general, on behalf of the Queen, also accredits Barbadian [[High Commissioner]]s and ambassadors and receives diplomats from foreign states. In addition, the issuance of passports falls under the Royal Prerogative and, as such, all [[Barbadian passport]]s are issued in the monarch's name.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

===Parliament (Queen-in-Parliament)===
[[File:Bridgetown barbados parliament building.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Parliament of Barbados]], in [[Bridgetown, Barbados|Bridgetown]]]]

The sovereign, along with the [[Senate of Barbados|Senate]] and the House of Assembly, is one of the three components of [[Parliament of Barbados|parliament]],<ref>{{harvnb| Elizabeth II| 2002| loc=V.35}}</ref> called the ''[[Queen-in-Parliament]]''. The authority of the Crown therein is embodied in the mace, which bears a crown at its apex; unlike other realms, however, the Barbados parliament only has a mace for the lower house.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.barbadosparliament.com/mace.php| author=Parliament of Barbados| title=The Mace of the House of Assembly| publisher=Government Printer| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081002152920/http://www.barbadosparliament.com/mace.php| archive-date=2 October 2008| df=dmy-all}}</ref> The monarch does not, however, participate in the legislative process; the viceroy does, though only in the granting of [[Royal Assent]].<ref name="Elizabeth II 2002 loc=V.581">{{harvnb| Elizabeth II| 2002| loc=V.58(1)}}</ref> Further, the constitution outlines that the governor-general alone is responsible for appointing senators. As in some other countries, such as Canada, the viceroy must make some senatorial appointments on the advice of the prime minister. However, uniquely, the constitution stipulates that two senators are to be appointed in consultation with the leader of the opposition and seven appointed by the governor-general acting at his own discretion.<ref>{{harvnb| Elizabeth II| 2002| loc=36(3)-(4)}}</ref> The viceroy additionally summons, [[Legislative session|prorogues]], and [[dissolution of Parliament|dissolves]] parliament;<ref>{{harvnb| Elizabeth II| 2002| loc=61(1)-(2)}}</ref> after the latter, the [[Writ of election|writs for a general election]] are usually [[Dropping the writ|dropped by the governor-general]] at [[Government House, Barbados|Government House]]. The new parliamentary session is marked by the [[State Opening of Parliament]], during which either the monarch or the governor-general reads the [[Speech from the Throne]].{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} As the monarch and viceroy cannot enter the House of Assembly, this, as well as the bestowing of Royal Assent, takes place in the Senate chamber; Members of Parliament are summoned to these ceremonies from the Commons by the Crown's messenger, the [[Black Rod|Usher of the Black Rod]], after he knocks on the doors of the lower house that have been slammed closed on him, to symbolise the barring of the monarch from the assembly.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

All laws in Barbados are enacted only with the viceroy's granting of [[Royal Assent]] in the monarch's name.<ref name="Elizabeth II 2002 loc=V.581"/> Thus, all bills begin with the phrase "Her Majesty, by virtue and in exercise of the powers vested in Her by section 5 of the Barbados Independence Act 1966 and of all other powers enabling Her in that behalf, is pleased, by and with the advice of Her Privy Council, to order, and it is hereby ordered, as follows..."<ref>{{citation| url=http://www.barbados.gov.bb/bdsconst.htm| author=Elizabeth II| title=Barbados Independence Order| year=1966| number=1455| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060707214412/http://www.barbados.gov.bb/bdsconst.htm| archive-date=7 July 2006| df=dmy-all}}</ref>

===Courts (Queen-on-the-Bench)===
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2016}}
The sovereign is deemed the ''fount of justice'', and is responsible for rendering justice for all subjects, known in this role as the ''[[Queen's Bench|Queen on the Bench]]''. However, he or she does not personally rule in judicial cases; instead, judicial functions are performed in his or her name. Hence, the common law holds that the sovereign "can do no wrong"; the monarch cannot be prosecuted in his or her own courts for criminal offences. Civil lawsuits against the Crown in its public capacity (that is, lawsuits against the government) are permitted; however, lawsuits against the monarch personally are not cognizable. In international cases, as a [[Sovereignty|sovereign]] and under established principles of [[international law]], the Queen of Barbados is not subject to suit in foreign courts without her express consent. The sovereign, and by extension the governor-general, also exercises the [[Pardon|prerogative of mercy]],<ref>{{harvnb| Elizabeth II| 2002| loc=VI.78(1)-(4)}}</ref> and may pardon offences against the Crown, either before, during, or after a trial. In addition, the monarch also serves as a symbol of the legitimacy of courts of justice and of their judicial authority. An image of the Queen or the [[Coat of arms of Barbados|Arms of Her Majesty in Right of Barbados]] is always displayed in Barbadian courtrooms. Judges also have a pair of white gloves from the Queen on display on the edge of the [[Bench (law)|bench]], which marks the authority of the court, similar to the [[ceremonial mace]] of parliament.

==Cultural role==
[[File:Barbados Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Bridgetown-1.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Bridgetown]]]]
From the beginning of Queen Elizabeth II's reign onwards, royal symbols in Barbados were altered to make them distinctly Barbadian or new ones created, such as the [[Coat of arms of Barbados|Royal Arms of Barbados]] (presented on 14 February 1966 by the Queen to then [[President of the Senate#Barbados|President of the Senate]] Sir [[Grey Massiah]])<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.national-symbol.com/B/Barbados/Barbados-national-symbol.htm| title=National Symbols: Barbados| access-date=9 September 2008| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714155540/http://www.national-symbol.com/B/Barbados/Barbados-national-symbol.htm| archive-date=14 July 2011| url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=BParl>{{cite web| url=http://www.barbadosparliament.com/independence.php| author=Parliament of Barbados| title=The Barbados Parliament: Independence| publisher=Government Printer| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081002152915/http://www.barbadosparliament.com/independence.php| archive-date=2 October 2008| df=dmy-all}}</ref> and the [[Queen's Personal Barbadian Flag|Queen's Royal Standard for Barbados]], created in 1975.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://flagspot.net/flags/bb-qe2.html| publisher=Flags of the World| title=Flag of Queen Elizabeth II in Barbados}}</ref> Second in precedence is the personal flag of the governor-general.

==History==
The current Barbadian [[monarchy]] can trace its ancestral lineage back to the [[History of Anglo-Saxon England|Anglo-Saxon]] period and, ultimately, back to the [[List of kings of the Angles|kings of the Angles]] and the early [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scottish kings]]. The Crown in Barbados has grown over the centuries since the Barbados was claimed under King [[James I of England|James VI of Scotland and I of England]] in 1625, though not colonised until 1627, when, in the name of King [[Charles I of England|Charles I]], Governor [[Charles Wolferstone]] established the first settlement on the island.<ref name=BParlHist>{{cite web| url=http://www.barbadosparliament.com/history.php| publisher=The Barbados Parliament| title=Parliament's History| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070523083154/http://www.barbadosparliament.com/history.php| archive-date=23 May 2007| df=dmy-all}}</ref> By the 18th century, Barbados became one of the main seats of British authority in the [[British West Indies]], though, due to the economic burden of duties and trade restrictions, some Barbadians, including the Clerk of the General Assembly, attempted to declare in 1727 that the [[Act of Settlement 1701]] had expired in the colony, since the Governor, [[Henry Worsley (ambassador)|Henry Worsley]], had not received a new commission from [[George II of Great Britain|King George II]] upon his accession to the throne. Thus, they refused to pay their taxes to a governor they recognised as having no authority. The Attorney and Solicitor General of Great Britain confirmed that Worsley was entitled to collect the dues owed, but, Worsley resigned his post before the directive arrived in Barbados.<ref>{{cite book| url=https://archive.org/details/historybarbados00schogoog| last=Schomburgk| first=Robert Hermann| title=The History of Barbados| page=[https://archive.org/details/historybarbados00schogoog/page/n360 318]| year=1848| publisher=Longman, Brown, Green, and Longmans| location=London}}</ref>

After attempting in 1958 [[West Indies Federation|a federation]] with other West Indian colonies, similar to that of fellow Commonwealth realms [[Canada]] and [[Australia]], continued as a [[self-governing colony]] under the [[Colonial Office]], until independence came with the signing of the [[Barbados Independence Act 1966|Barbados Independence Order]] by Queen Elizabeth II. In the same year, Elizabeth's cousin, [[Prince Edward, Duke of Kent]], opened the second session of the first parliament of the newly established country,<ref name=BParlHist /> before the Queen herself, along with her husband, [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]], toured Barbados, opening [[Barclays Park, Saint Andrew, Barbados|Barclays Park]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.barbados.org/barclays.htm|title=Barclays Park, Barbados|first=Barbados.org Travel|last=Guide}}</ref> in [[Saint Andrew, Barbados|Saint Andrew]], amongst other events. Elizabeth returned for [[Silver Jubilee of Elizabeth II|her Silver Jubilee]] in 1977, after addressing the new session of parliament, she departed on the [[Concorde]], which was the Queen's first [[supersonic]] flight.<ref name=BParlHist /> She also was in Barbados in 1989, to mark the 350th anniversary of the establishment of the Barbados parliament, where she sat to receive addresses from both houses.<ref name="Buck1" /><ref name=BParlHist /> In 2016 the Queen shared person congratulations to the people and government of Barbados on reaching 50 years of political independence and touched on her family's fondness of Barbados and witnessing development of nation over that time.<ref>[https://www.royal.uk/message-her-majesty-queen-people-barbados-50th-anniversary-independence A message from Her Majesty The Queen to the people of Barbados on the 50th Anniversary of Independence], Published 30 November 2016, ELIZABETH R.</ref>
