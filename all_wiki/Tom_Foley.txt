'''Thomas Stephen Foley''' (March 6, 1929 – October 18, 2013) was an American lawyer and politician who served as the [[List of Speakers of the United States House of Representatives|49th]] [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives]] from 1989 to 1995. A member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], Foley represented Washington's [[Washington's 5th congressional district|fifth district]] for thirty years {{nowrap|(1965–1995).}} He was the first Speaker of the House since 1862 to be defeated in a re-election campaign.

Born in [[Spokane, Washington]], Foley attended [[Gonzaga University]] and pursued a legal career after graduating from the [[University of Washington School of Law]] in [[Seattle]]. He joined the staff of Senator [[Henry M. Jackson]] after working as a prosecutor and an assistant attorney general. With Jackson's support, Foley won election to the House of Representatives, defeating incumbent [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] Congressman [[Walt Horan]]. He served as Majority Whip from 1981 to 1987 and as Majority Leader from 1987 to 1989. After the resignation of [[Jim Wright]], Foley became Speaker of the House.

Foley's district had become increasingly conservative during his tenure, but he won re-election throughout the 1980s and early 1990s. In the [[United States House of Representatives elections, 1994|1994]] election, Foley faced attorney [[George Nethercutt]]. Nethercutt mobilized popular anger over Foley's opposition to [[Term limits in the United States|term limits]] to defeat the incumbent Speaker. After leaving the House, Foley served as the [[United States Ambassador to Japan]] from 1997 to 2001 under President [[Bill Clinton]].

==Early life and legal practice==
Born and raised in [[Spokane, Washington]], Foley was the son of Helen Marie (née Higgins), a school teacher,<ref name=schsmad>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=0lhYAAAAIBAJ&pg=6927%2C697058 |newspaper=Spokane Chronicle |location=(Washington)|title=House speaker's mother dies at 88 |date=January 5, 1990 |page=A1}}</ref> and Ralph E.

Foley graduated from the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]]-run [[Gonzaga Preparatory School]] in Spokane in 1946 and attended [[Gonzaga University]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gonzagabulletin.com/image_e19557a4-a81c-11e4-93ad-ef7020015e12.html|title=Tom Foley|date=January 29, 2015|accessdate=July 25, 2018|publisher=The Gonzaga Bulletin|location=Spokane, Washington}}</ref> for three years; he completed his bachelor's degree at the [[University of Washington]] in Seattle, then attended its [[University of Washington School of Law|School of Law]] and was awarded a law degree in 1957.

Following law school, Foley entered private practice. In 1958, he began working in the [[Spokane County, Washington|Spokane County]] prosecutor's office as a deputy [[Prosecutor|prosecuting attorney]],<ref name=tf>{{cite news|url=http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/ex-house-speaker-tom-foley-reigned-in-friendlier-political-era/|title=Ex-House Speaker Tom Foley reigned in friendlier political era|work=[[Seattle Times]]|date=October 19, 2013|accessdate=September 22, 2015|last=Song|first=Kyung M.}}</ref> and later taught at Gonzaga's [[Gonzaga University School of Law|School of Law]] (in Spokane) from 1958 to 1959. He joined the [[Washington Attorney General|state attorney general]]'s office in 1961 as an assistant attorney general.<ref name=tf/>

In 1961, Foley moved to Washington, D.C., and joined the staff of Senator [[Henry M. Jackson|Henry Jackson]], the then-Democratic Senator From Washington.<ref name=tf/> He left Jackson's employ in 1964 at his urging to run for {{nowrap|Congress.<ref name=tf/>}}

==Congressional service==
In 1964, Foley was unopposed for the Democratic nomination for Washington's [[Washington's 5th congressional district|5th congressional seat]],<ref name=hfeatv>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=N49YAAAAIBAJ&pg=7282,3971166|newspaper=Spokane Daily Chronicle|title=Horan, Foley express appreciation to voters|date=September 16, 1964|page=5}}</ref> which included Spokane. He faced 11-term [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] incumbent [[Walt Horan]] in the [[1964 United States House of Representatives elections|general election]] and won by seven points, one of many swept into office in the [[1964 United States presidential election|1964 Democratic landslide]]. He was re-elected without significant difficulty until 1978, when in a 3-person race, he won only 48% of the vote. Two years later, he narrowly defeated Republican candidate John Sonneland (52% to 48%). Though the fifth district became increasingly conservative, Foley didn't face serious opposition again until his defeat in [[1994 United States House of Representatives elections|1994]]. Foley voted in favor of the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/89-1965/h87|title=TO PASS H.R. 6400, THE 1965 VOTING RIGHTS ACT.}}</ref> the [[Civil Rights Act of 1968]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/90-1967/h113|title=TO PASS H.R. 2516, A BILL TO ESTABLISH PENALTIES FOR INTERFERENCE WITH CIVIL RIGHTS.

VETO OVERRIDDEN; TWO-THIRDS OF THOSE PRESENT VOTING IN FAVOR.}}</ref>

During his first term in the House, Foley was appointed to the [[United States House Committee on Agriculture|Agriculture Committee]] and the [[United States House Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs|Interior and Insular Affairs Committee]]. He served on the latter committee through 1975 when he became chairman of the Agriculture Committee in 1975. In 1981, when Foley was appointed [[Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives|Majority Whip]], he left the Agriculture Committee to serve on the House Administration Committee. Six years later, January 1987, he was elected House Majority Leader.

===Speaker of the House===
In June 1989, [[Jim Wright]] of [[Texas]] resigned as [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House of Representatives]] (only the fourth speaker ever to resign) and from Congress amid a [[United States House Committee on Ethics|House Ethics Committee]] investigation into his personal business dealings.<ref>{{cite web| last=Smith| first=Timothy R.| date=May 6, 2015| title=Jim Wright, House speaker who resigned amid an ethics investigation, dies at 92| work=The Washington Post| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/jim-wright-texas-democrat-who-was-speaker-of-the-house-dies-at-92/2015/05/06/2b5d116c-f406-11e4-bcc4-e8141e5eb0c9_story.html| accessdate=February 6, 2019}}</ref> In the June 6 election to succeed Wright, Foley was the victor, receiving 251 votes; his Republican opponent, Minority Leader [[Robert H.

During the [[101st United States Congress|101st Congress]], Foley presided over the House as it passed a landmark update to the 1963 [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]], measures protecting persons with disabilities, the [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990|Americans with Disabilities Act]] and the [[Individuals with Disabilities Education Act]], as well as the [[Budget Enforcement Act of 1990]]. The budget act, a part of the massive [[Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990]], established the "[[PAYGO|pay-as-you-go]]" process for discretionary spending and taxes, and was signed into law by [[President of the United States|President]] [[George H. W. Bush]] on November 5, 1990, contrary to his [[1988 United States presidential election|1988]] [[Read my lips: no new taxes|campaign promise not to raise taxes]]. This became a significant issue during the [[1992 United States presidential election|1992 presidential campaign]].<ref name=WAPO10182013>{{cite web| last=Langer| first=Emily| date=October 18, 2013| title=Thomas S.

In 1993, the [[103rd United States Congress|103rd Congress]] passed a second [[Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993|omnibus budget act]] through which the [[Federal government of the United States|government]] was able to raise additional revenue and balance the federal budget. Signed into law by President [[Bill Clinton]] signed on August 10, 1993, the measure stirred controversy because of the tax increases it imposed.<ref name=WAPO10182013/> Under Foley's leadership Congress also passed the [[Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993]], the [[North American Free Trade Agreement|North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act]],<ref name=WAPO10182013/> as well as the [[Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act]] plus legislation that laid the groundwork for the "[[Don't ask, don't tell]]" military service policy instituted by the [[Presidency of Bill Clinton|Clinton Administration]] in 1994.

===Term limits===
During his time in the House, Foley repeatedly opposed efforts to impose [[term limit]]s on Washington state's elected officials, winning the support of the state's voters to reject term limits in a 1991 referendum; however, in 1992, a term limit ballot initiative was approved by the state's voters.<ref name=tf/>

Foley brought suit, challenging the constitutionality of a state law setting eligibility requirements on federal offices. Foley won his suit, with a [[United States District Court]] declaring that states did not have the authority under the [[United States Constitution]] to limit the terms of federal officeholders.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/11/us/federal-judge-strikes-down-law-limiting-the-terms-of-lawmakers.html |title=Federal Judge Strikes Down Law Limiting the Terms of Lawmakers |last=Egan |first=Timonty |date=February 11, 1994 |website=The New York Times |access-date=January 17, 2017}}</ref>

However, in Foley's bid for a 16th term in the House, his [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] opponent, [[George Nethercutt]], used the issue against him, citing the caption of the federal case brought by Foley, "Foley against the People of the State of Washington". Nethercutt vowed that if elected, he would not serve more than three terms in the House (but ultimately served for five terms). Foley lost in a narrow race. While Foley had usually relied on large margins in Spokane to carry him to victory, in 1994 he won Spokane by only 9,000 votes, while Nethercutt did well enough in the rest of the district to win overall by just under 4,000 votes.

Foley became the first incumbent Speaker of the House to lose his bid for re-election since [[Galusha A. Grow]] in 1862. He is sometimes viewed as a political casualty of the term limits controversy of the early 1990s. President Bill Clinton attributed Foley's defeat to his support for the [[Federal Assault Weapons Ban]] of 1994.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gunshopfinder.com/legislativenews/clinton8_1_04.html |title=My Life |publisher=Vintage |accessdate=December 23, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120731021921/http://www.gunshopfinder.com/legislativenews/clinton8_1_04.html |archivedate=July 31, 2012 }}</ref>

==Later career==
From 1995 to 1998, Foley was head of the [[Federal City Council]], a group of business, civic, education, and other leaders interested in economic development in Washington, D.C.<ref>{{cite news|last=King|first=Colbert I.|title=Fred, Did We Really Know You?|work=The Washington Post|date=September 8, 2007|page=A15|postscript=none}}; {{cite news|title=Order in the House — and the Garage|work=Washington Business Journal|date=June 30, 1997|accessdate=November 27, 2016|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/washington/stories/1997/06/30/tidbits.html}}</ref>

In 1997, Foley was appointed as the 25th [[U.S. Ambassador to Japan]] by President Bill Clinton,<ref>[http://www.businessweek.com/archives/1997/b3526076.arc.htm Commentary: "Is Tom Foley the Wrong Man to Send to Tokyo?"] ''BusinessWeek.''
