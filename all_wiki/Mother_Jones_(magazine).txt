==History==
For the first five years after its inception in 1976,<ref name=":0">{{cite journal|title=Mother Jones Magazine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O-cDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PT3|accessdate=November 23, 2015|date=November 1992|journal=Mother Jones|page=3|issn=0362-8841|last1 = Jones|first1 = Mother}}</ref> ''Mother Jones'' operated with an editorial board, and members of the board took turns serving as managing editor for one-year terms. People who served on the editorial team during those years included [[Adam Hochschild]], [[Paul Jacobs (activist)|Paul Jacobs]], [[Richard Parker (economist)|Richard Parker]], Deborah Johnson, [[Jeffrey Bruce Klein]], Mark Dowie, Amanda Spake, Zina Klapper, and [[Deirdre English]]. According to Hochschild, Parker, "who worked as both editor and publisher, saw to it that ''Mother Jones'' took the best of what could be learned from the world of commercial publishing."<ref name="about">{{cite web|last=Hochschild|first=Adam|title=The History of Mother Jones|url=https://www.motherjones.com/about/what-mother-jones/our-history|accessdate=October 19, 2012}}</ref>

[[Michael Moore]], who had owned and published the [[Flint, Michigan]]-based ''Michigan Voice'' for ten years,  followed English and edited ''Mother Jones'' for several months, until he was fired for disputed reasons. [[Matt Labash]] of ''[[The Weekly Standard]]'' reported this was for refusing to print an article that was critical of the [[Sandinista National Liberation Front|Sandinista]] human rights record in Nicaragua<ref name=Schultz>{{cite book|last=Schultz|first=Emily|title=Michael Moore: a biorgraphy|year=2005|publisher=ECW Press|location=47–54|isbn=1-55022-699-1|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/michaelmoore00emil}}</ref>—a view supported by ''[[The Nation]]'' columnist [[Alexander Cockburn]], but denied by Hochschild and others at the magazine.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Cockburn |first=Alexander |author-link=Alexander Cockburn |title=Beat the Devil |journal=[[The Nation]] |date=September 13, 1986|page=198 |publisher=The Nation Company L.P.|location=New York, New York |issn=0027-8378}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Hochschild |first=Adam |author-link=Adam Hochschild |author2=Hazen, Don |author3=Cockburn Alexander  |title=Letters |journal=[[The Nation]] |date=1986-10-04 |pages=298, 323–324|publisher=The Nation Company L.P. |location=New York, New York |issn=0027-8378|display-authors=etal}}</ref>

Moore believes that he was fired because of his defiant reaction to the publisher's refusal to allow him to cover a story on the GM plant closings in Flint.<ref>Matt Labash. [http://www.weeklystandard.com/michael-moore-one-trick-phony/article/5507 Michael Moore, One-Trick Phony]. ''[[The Weekly Standard]]''. June 8, 1998.</ref> Moore also felt that he did not have a chance to shape the magazine, and that many of the articles that were printed during his time as editor were articles that had already been commissioned by Deirdre English.

After being fired in 1986, Moore sued ''Mother Jones'' for $2 million for wrongful termination,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/27/us/radical-magazine-removes-editor-setting-off-a-widening-political-debate.html|title=Radical Magazine Removes Editor, Setting Off A Widening Political Debate|last=Jones|first=Alex S.|date=1986-09-27|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-07-13|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> but settled with the magazine's insurance company for $58,000<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0qUJ-JuSPdQC&pg=PA750 |title=Movies in American History: An Encyclopedia [3 volumes]: An Encyclopedia|last=DiMare|first=Philip C.|date=2011-06-17|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=9781598842975|language=en}}</ref>&mdash;$8000 more than the initial offering.

[[Russ Rymer]] was named editor-in-chief in early 2005, and under his tenure the magazine published more essays and extensive packages of articles on domestic violence (July/August 2005),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.motherjones.com/news/featurex/2005/07/haven.htm |title=Domestic Violence: A Special Report|work=Mother Jones |date=July 2005|accessdate=November 4, 2008}}</ref> and the role of religion in politics (December 2005).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.motherjones.com/toc/2005/12/index.html |title=Contents |work=Mother Jones|date=December 2005|accessdate=November 4, 2008}}</ref>

In August 2006, [[Monika Bauerlein]] and [[Clara Jeffery]] were promoted from within to become co-editors of the magazine. Bauerlein and Jeffery, who had served as interim editors between Cohn and Rymer, were also chiefly responsible for some of the biggest successes of the magazine in the past several years, including a package on [[ExxonMobil]]'s funding of [[climate change]] "deniers" (May/June 2005)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.motherjones.com/news/featurex/2005/05/world_burns.html |title=As The World Burns |work=Mother Jones |date=May 2005 |accessdate=November 4, 2008}}</ref> that was nominated for a National Magazine Award for Public Interest reporting; a package on the rapid decline in the health of the ocean (March/April 2006),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.motherjones.com/news/featurex/2006/03/oceans_index.html |title=The Last Days of the Ocean |work=Mother Jones |date=March 2006 |accessdate=November 4, 2008}}</ref> and the magazine's massive Iraq War Timeline interactive database.<ref name="Lie By Lie">{{cite web|url=https://www.motherjones.com/bush_war_timeline/ |title=Lie By Lie |work=Mother Jones |accessdate=November 4, 2008}}</ref>

In December 2013, ''Mother Jones'' was criticized for its labor practices regarding the employment of interns, as part of the Ben Bagdikian Fellowship Program. The program allowed college students to enroll as “fellows” who would receive a monthly stipend of 1,000 dollars while working for the magazine in [[San Francisco]]. Writer Charles Davis of ''[[Vice magazine|Vice]]'' criticized this practice as exploitative noting that “a fellow [working] at Mother Jones earns less than $6 an hour in a state, California, that just decided to raise the minimum wage to $10.” Following the publication of the article, Mother Jones announced that it would reform its budget to provide fellows with equivalent to California's minimum wage. According to Davis, a former intern alleged that they were advised by the company's human resources department to register for food stamps.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Davis |first1=Charles |title=The Exploited Laborers of the Liberal Media |url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/mv5ekb/the-exploited-laborers-of-the-liberal-media |website=Vice.com |publisher=Vice |accessdate=6 August 2019 |date=2 December 2013}}</ref>

The magazine was subject of controversy regarding an October 2016 article about white supremacist figure [[Richard B.

What am I missing here?"<ref>{{cite web |last1=Drum |first1=Kevin |title=I don't understand the Wayfair walkout |url=https://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2019/06/i-dont-understand-the-wayfair-walkout/ |website=Mother Jones |accessdate=7 August 2019}}</ref> In response to these comments, Lachance wrote "In a cruel and violent world, full of exponentially increasing climate change, natural disasters, food shortages and wars, people cross borders in search of a place where they have a sliver of a chance to survive. That determination for life should be celebrated, not criminalized. Drum has an attitude toward immigrants that is xenophobic and deeply embarrassing for Mother Jones."<ref>{{cite web |last1=Lachance |first1=Naomi |title=Mother Jones Is Failing Its Namesake |url=https://fair.org/home/mother-jones-is-failing-its-namesake/ |website=fair.org |publisher=FAIR |accessdate=7 August 2019 |date=23 July 2019}}</ref>
