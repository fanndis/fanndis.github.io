'''John Patrick McEnroe Jr.''' (born February 16, 1959) is a former professional American [[tennis]]  player. He was known for his shot-making artistry and volleying skills, and for confrontational on-court behavior that frequently landed him in trouble with umpires and tennis authorities.

McEnroe attained the No. 1 ranking in both [[List of ATP number 1 ranked singles tennis players|singles]] and [[List of ATP number 1 ranked doubles tennis players|doubles]], finishing his career with 77 singles and 78 doubles titles; this remains the [[Tennis players with most titles in the Open Era#Men|highest men's combined total]] of the [[Open Era]]. He won seven [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] singles titles, four at the [[US Open (tennis)|US Open]] and three at [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]], and nine men's Grand Slam doubles titles. His singles match record of 82–3 in 1984 remains the [[Tennis records of the Open Era – men's singles#Single season records|best single season win rate]] of the Open Era.

McEnroe also excelled at the year-end tournaments, winning [[Open Era tennis records – men's singles#Year-end championships|eight singles]] and [[ATP Finals#Doubles|seven doubles]] titles, both of which are records. Three of his winning singles year-end championships were at the [[ATP Finals|Masters Grand Prix]] (the ATP year-end event) and five were at the [[WCT Finals|World Championship Tennis (WCT) Finals]], an event which ended in 1989.  Since 2000, there has been only one year-end men's singles event, the ATP Finals (the new name for the Masters Grand Prix). He was named the [[ATP Awards|ATP Player of the Year]] and the [[ITF World Champion]] three times each: 1981, 1983 and 1984.

McEnroe contributed to five [[Davis Cup]] titles for the U.S. and later was team captain. He has stayed active in retirement, often competing in senior events on the [[ATP Champions Tour]]. He has also worked as a television commentator during the majors.

==Early life==
McEnroe was born in [[Wiesbaden]], [[West Germany]] (present-day Germany) to American parents, John Patrick McEnroe and his wife Kay, ''née'' Tresham.<ref name="descent">McEnroe, with Kaplan, 2002, ''Serious'', pp. 17-18.</ref> His father, the son of Irish immigrants, was at the time stationed with the [[United States Air Force]].<ref name="descent"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tennis.com/pro-game/2017/02/john-mcenroe-sr-passes-away-john-mcenroe-notable-deaths-tennis/64420/ |title=John McEnroe, Sr. was a colorful character from tennis' golden age |first=Steve |last=Tignor |date=February 24, 2017 |website=Tennis.com |access-date=July 9, 2017}}</ref> McEnroe's Irish paternal grandfather was from [[Ballyjamesduff]] in [[County Cavan]] and his grandmother was from [[County Westmeath]].

When he was about nine months old, the family moved to the [[Stewart Air National Guard Base|Stewart Air Force Base]] in [[Newburgh, New York]] when his father was transferred back to the US.  In 1961, they moved to [[Flushing, Queens]], then to Douglaston in 1963.<ref name="MMWSJ">{{cite news |last1=Myers |first1=Marc |title=John McEnroe: From Homes in Queens to a Central Park Duplex |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/john-mcenroe-from-homes-in-queens-to-a-central-park-duplex-1487089675 |access-date=March 15, 2019 |newspaper=The Wall Street Journal |date=February 14, 2017}}</ref>

After leaving the Air Force, McEnroe's father worked daytime as an advertising agent while attending [[Fordham Law School]]<ref name="nyt20000130"/> by night. John has two younger brothers: Mark (born 1964) and former professional tennis player [[Patrick McEnroe|Patrick]] (born 1966).

McEnroe grew up in [[Douglaston, Queens|Douglaston]], [[Queens]], [[New York City]]. He started playing tennis when he was eight, at the nearby Douglaston Club. When he was nine, his parents enrolled him in the Eastern Lawn Tennis Association, and he soon started playing regional tournaments. He then began competing in national juniors tournaments, and at twelve—when he was ranked seventh in his age group—he joined the [[Port Washington Tennis Academy]], [[Long Island, New York]].<ref>McEnroe, with Kaplan, 2002, ''Serious'', p. 24-25.</ref> McEnroe attended [[Trinity School (New York City)|Trinity School]] and graduated in 1977.

==Career==
As an 18-year-old amateur in 1977, McEnroe won the mixed doubles at the [[French Open]] with [[Mary Carillo]], and then made it through the qualifying tournament at Wimbledon and into the main draw, where he lost in the semifinals to [[Jimmy Connors]] in four sets. It was the best performance by a qualifier at a Grand Slam tournament and a record performance by an amateur in the [[Tennis Open Era|open era]].<ref name="ATP player profile"/>

After Wimbledon in 1977, McEnroe was recruited by Coach [[Dick Gould]] and entered [[Stanford University]], where, in 1978, he led the Stanford team to an [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] championship, and also won the NCAA singles title. Later in 1978, he joined the ATP tour and signed his first professional [[Endorsement (advertising)|endorsement]] deal, with [[Sergio Tacchini]]. He again advanced to the semifinals at a Grand Slam, this time the US Open, losing to Connors. Following which, he proceeded to win five titles that year, including his first [[Masters Cup|Masters Grand Prix]], beating [[Arthur Ashe]] in straight sets, as well as Grand Prix events at Stockholm and Wembley.  His late-season success allowed him to finish as the number four ranked player for the year.

===1979–83===
[[File:John McEnroe (1979).jpg|thumb|left|250px|John McEnroe at the 1979 ABN Tennis Tournament]]
In 1979, McEnroe and partner [[Peter Fleming (tennis)|Peter Fleming]] won the Wimbledon Doubles title, followed shortly by a win in the US Open Doubles. That same week, McEnroe won the men's singles [[1979 US Open (tennis)|US Open]] title, his first Grand Slam singles title. He defeated his friend [[Vitas Gerulaitis]] in straight sets in the final to become the youngest male winner of the singles title at the US Open since [[Pancho Gonzales]], who was also 20 in 1948.<ref>[[Pete Sampras]] eventually became the youngest US Open Champion at 19 years old.</ref> He also won the prestigious season-ending [[WCT Finals]], beating [[Björn Borg]] in four sets. McEnroe won 10 singles and 17 doubles titles that year (for a total of 27 titles, which marked an open-era record){{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} finishing at number 3 in the ATP year-end rankings.

At [[1980 Wimbledon Championships|Wimbledon]], McEnroe reached the [[1980 Wimbledon Men's Singles final]]—his first final at Wimbledon—where he faced [[Björn Borg]], who was gunning for his fifth consecutive Wimbledon title. At the start of the final, McEnroe was booed by the crowd as he entered Centre Court following heated exchanges with officials during his semifinal victory over [[Jimmy Connors]]. In a fourth-set tiebreaker that lasted 20 minutes, McEnroe saved five match points and eventually won 18–16. McEnroe, however, could not break Borg's serve in the fifth set, which the Swede won 8–6. This match was called the best Wimbledon final by [[ESPN]]'s countdown show "Who's Number One?"

McEnroe exacted revenge two months later, beating Björn Borg in the five-set final of the [[1980 US Open (tennis)|1980 US Open]].  He was a finalist at the season-ending WCT Finals and finished as the number 2 ranked player for the year behind only Borg.

[[File:Mcenroe dunlop ad.jpg|thumb|right|180px|McEnroe in a [[Dunlop Sport|Dunlop]] advertisement published on ''[[El Gráfico]]'', 1981]]
McEnroe remained controversial when he returned to [[1981 Wimbledon Championships|Wimbledon in 1981]]. Following his first-round match against [[Tom Gullikson]], McEnroe was fined U.S. $1,500 and came close to being thrown out after he called umpire [[Ted James (umpire)|Ted James]] "the pits of the world" and then swore at tournament referee [[Fred Hoyles]]. He also made famous the phrase "you cannot be serious", which years later became the title of [[You Cannot Be Serious|McEnroe's autobiography]], by shouting it after several umpires' calls during his matches.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/john-mcenroe-i-am-being-deadly-serious-murray-is-a-kindred-spirit-2297421.html |title=John McEnroe: 'I am being deadly serious... Murray is a kindred spirit' |date=June 15, 2011 |newspaper=The Independent |location=London |access-date=June 15, 2011}}</ref> This behavior was in sharp contrast to that of Borg, who was painted by the press as an unflappable "Ice Man."<ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=j60iAAAAIBAJ&sjid=57EFAAAAIBAJ&pg=3278%2C2901639 |first=William R. |last=Barnard |title=Borg knocks off McEnroe |newspaper=[[The Beaver County Times]] |location=[[Beaver, Pennsylvania]] |date=January 15, 1981 |page=B4 |access-date=February 9, 2018}}</ref> Nevertheless, in matches played between the two, McEnroe never lost his temper.<ref name="nyt20000130"/>

After the controversy and criticism from the British press (Ian Barnes of the ''[[Daily Express]]'' nicknamed him "SuperBrat"), McEnroe again reached the Wimbledon men's singles final in 1981 against Borg. This time, McEnroe prevailed in four sets to end the Swede's run of 41 consecutive match victories at the [[All England Club]]. TV commentator [[Bud Collins]] quipped after the [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]] battle, paraphrasing "[[Yankee Doodle]]", "Stick a feather in his cap and call it 'McEnroe-ni'!".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://espn.go.com/classic/biography/s/McEnroe_John.html |title=McEnroe was McNasty on and off the court |first=Larry |last=Schwartz |website=ESPN Classic |access-date=February 9, 2018}}</ref>

The controversy, however, did not end there. In response to McEnroe's on-court outbursts during the Championships, the All England Club did not accord McEnroe honorary club membership, an honor normally given to singles champions after their first victory. McEnroe responded by not attending the traditional champions' dinner that evening. The honor was eventually accorded to McEnroe after he won the championship again.

Borg and McEnroe had their final confrontation in the final of the [[1981 US Open (tennis)|1981 US Open]]. McEnroe won in four sets, becoming the first male player since the 1920s to win three consecutive US Open singles titles. Borg never played another Grand Slam event. McEnroe also won his second [[WCT Finals|WCT Final]], beating [[Johan Kriek]] in straight sets and finished the year as the number one ranked player. He was named the [[Associated Press Athlete of the Year]], the second men's tennis player ever after [[Don Budge]] in the 1930s.

McEnroe lost to [[Jimmy Connors]] in the 1982 Wimbledon final. McEnroe lost only one set (to [[Johan Kriek]]) going into the final; however, Connors won the fourth-set tiebreak and the fifth set.  He fell in the semi-finals at the US Open that year and was a finalist at the WCT Finals.  He was able to retain the ATP's number 1 ranking based on points at the end of the year on the basis of having won significant events at Philadelphia, Wembley, and Tokyo, but due to Connors' victories at the two most important events of the year (Wimbledon and the US Open), Connors was named the player of the year by the ATP and most other tennis authorities.

In 1983, McEnroe reached his fourth consecutive Wimbledon final, dropping only one set throughout the tournament (to [[Florin Segărceanu]]) and sweeping aside the unheralded New Zealander [[Chris Lewis (tennis player)|Chris Lewis]] in straight-sets. At the US Open, he was defeated in the fourth round, his earliest exit since 1977.  He played at the Australian Open for the first time, making it to the semifinals before being defeated in four sets by [[Mats Wilander]]. He made the [[WCT Finals|WCT Final]] for the third time and beat [[Ivan Lendl]] in an epic five-setter. He took the [[Masters Cup|Masters Grand Prix]] title for the second time, again beating Lendl in straight sets.  He also won major events at Philadelphia, Forest Hills, and Wembley, enabling him to capture the year-end number one ranking once again.

===1984: best season===

McEnroe's best season came in 1984, as he compiled an 82–3 match record that remains the [[Open Era tennis records – men's singles#Single season records|highest single-season win rate]] of the Open Era. He won a career-high 13 singles tournaments, including Wimbledon and the US Open, capturing the year-end number one ranking. He also played on the winning US [[World Team Cup]] and runner-up [[Davis Cup]] teams.

He began the year with a 42-match win streak, winning his first six events of the year and reaching his first French Open final, where his opponent was [[Ivan Lendl]]. McEnroe won the first two sets, but Lendl's adjustments of using more topspin lobs and cross-court backhand passing shots, as well as McEnroe's fatigue and temperamental outbursts, resulted in a demoralizing five-set loss. In his autobiography, McEnroe described this as his most bitter defeat and implied that he's never quite gotten over it.

He rebounded at Wimbledon, losing just one set en route to his third Wimbledon singles title. This included a straight-set rout over Jimmy Connors in the final. He then won his fourth US Open title by defeating Lendl in straight sets in the final, after defeating Connors in a five-set semifinal. He also won his fourth [[WCT Finals|WCT Final]], defeating Connors in straight sets, and took his third [[Masters Cup|Masters Grand Prix]], beating Lendl in straight sets.  His combined record against the number 2 and 3 ranked players for the year, Jimmy Connors and Ivan Lendl, respectively, was 11–1, including going undefeated versus Connors in 5 matches.

The year did not end without controversy. While playing and winning the tournament in Stockholm, McEnroe had an on-court outburst that soon became notorious. After questioning a call made by the chair umpire, McEnroe demanded, "Answer my question! The question, jerk!" McEnroe then slammed his racquet into a juice cart beside the court in anger, and the stadium crowd booed him. He was suspended for 3 weeks (21 days) for exceeding a $7,500 limit on fines that had been created because of his behavior.<ref name="nyt20000130"/>  As a result, he was disqualified from competing in the following week's significant Wembley (London) Indoor tournament, at which he was supposed to be the number one seed, with Connors and Lendl (the eventual winner) as the second and third seeds. During his suspension, he injured his left wrist in practice causing him to withdraw from the [[Australian Open]], the fourth major of the year.

===Taking time out===
In 1985, having reached the semi-finals at the French Open, McEnroe was beaten in straight sets by [[Kevin Curren]] in the quarter-finals of [[1985 Wimbledon Championships – Men's Singles|Wimbledon]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Cambers |first1=Simon |title=Kevin Curren: 1985 Wimbledon defeat by Boris Becker a special not bitter memory |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/jun/25/kevin-curren-1985-wimbledon-boris-becker |access-date=January 26, 2018 |newspaper=The Guardian |date=June 25, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Alfano |first1=Peter |title=McEnroe is routed for his worst loss in Wimbledon play |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/07/04/sports/mcenroe-is-routed-for-his-worst-loss-in-wimbledon-play.html |access-date=January 26, 2018 |newspaper=The New York Times |date=July 4, 1985}}</ref> He reached his last Grand Slam singles final at the US Open; this time, he was beaten in straight sets by Lendl.  He did not advance past the quarter-finals at the WCT Finals or the Masters Grand Prix.  He did win major events at Philadelphia (his 4th straight there), Canada (2nd straight) and Stockholm (2nd straight and 4th overall) and finished the year as the number two ranked player.

By 1986, the pressures of playing at the top had become too much for McEnroe to handle, and he took a six-month break from the tour. It was during this sabbatical that on August 1, 1986, he married actress [[Tatum O'Neal]], with whom he had already had a son, Kevin (1986). They had two more children, Sean (1987) and Emily (1991), before divorcing in 1994. When he returned to the tour later in 1986, he won three ATP tournaments, but in 1987 he failed to win a title for the first time since turning pro. He took a seven-month break from the game following the US Open, where he was suspended for two months and fined US$17,500 for misconduct and verbal abuse.

===World No. 1 ranking===
McEnroe became the top-ranked singles player in the world on March 3, 1980.<ref name="ATP player profile"/> He was the top-ranked player on 14 separate occasions between 1980 and 1985 and finished the year ranked No. 1 four straight years from 1981 through 1984. He spent a total of 170 weeks at the top of the rankings.

===Success in doubles===
[[File:Fleming & McEnroe Wimbledon 1980s.jpg|thumb|right|180px|McEnroe with Peter Fleming (left) at Wimbledon, mid 1980s]]
It has been written about McEnroe that he might have been "the greatest doubles player of all time" and "possibly the greatest team player never to have played a team sport."<ref name="nyt20000130"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tennisfame.com/hall-of-famers/john-mcenroe |title=John McEnroe |website=[[International Tennis Hall of Fame]] |access-date=October 28, 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029220802/http://www.tennisfame.com/hall-of-famers/john-mcenroe |archive-date=October 29, 2013 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book | url=https://archive.org/details/epicjohnmcenroeb00cron | url-access=registration | quote=mcenroe greatest doubles. |last=Cronin |first=Matthew |title=Epic: John McEnroe, Bjorn Borg, and the Greatest Tennis Season Ever |date=March 10, 2011 |publisher=Wiley |isbn=978-1-118-01595-7 |page=[https://archive.org/details/epicjohnmcenroeb00cron/page/144 144]}}</ref> He was ranked No. 1 in doubles for 270 weeks. He formed a powerful partnership with [[Peter Fleming (tennis player)|Peter Fleming]], with whom he won 57 men's doubles titles, including four at Wimbledon and three at the US Open. Fleming was always very modest about his own contribution to the partnership – he once said: "the best doubles partnership in the world is McEnroe and anybody."<ref name="nyt20000130"/> McEnroe won a fourth US Open men's doubles title in 1989 with [[Mark Woodforde]], and a fifth Wimbledon men's doubles title in 1992 with [[Michael Stich]]. He also won the 1977 French Open mixed doubles title with childhood friend [[Mary Carillo]].

===Davis Cup===
More than any other player in his era, McEnroe was responsible for reviving U.S. interest in the [[Davis Cup]],<ref name="nyt20000130"/> which had been shunned by Jimmy Connors and other leading U.S. players, and had not seen a top U.S. player regularly compete since [[Arthur Ashe]]. Connors's refusal to play Davis Cup instead of lucrative exhibitions became a source of enmity between him and Ashe. In 1978, McEnroe won two singles rubbers in the final as the U.S. captured the cup for the first time since 1972, beating Great Britain in the final. McEnroe continued to be a mainstay of U.S. Davis Cup teams for the next 14 years and was part of U.S. winning teams in 1978, 1979, 1981, 1982, and 1992. He set numerous U.S. Davis Cup records, including years played (12), ties (30), singles wins (41), and total wins in singles and doubles (59). He played both singles and doubles in 13 series, and he and [[Peter Fleming (tennis player)|Peter Fleming]] won 14 of 15 Davis Cup doubles matches together.

An epic performance was McEnroe's 6-hour, 22-minute victory over [[Mats Wilander]] in the deciding rubber of the 3–2 quarterfinal win over Sweden in 1982, played in St. Louis, Missouri. McEnroe won the match, at the time the longest in Davis Cup history, 9–7, 6–2, 15–17, 3–6, 8–6. McEnroe nearly broke that record in a 6-hour, 20-minute loss to [[Boris Becker]] five years later. Becker won their match, the second rubber in a 3–2 loss to West Germany in World Group Relegation play, 4–6, 15–13, 8–10, 6–2, 6–2.

McEnroe also helped the U.S. win the [[World Team Cup]] in 1984 and 1985, in both cases defeating [[Czechoslovakia]] in the final.

===Final years on the tour===
McEnroe struggled to regain his form after his 1986 sabbatical. He lost three times in Grand Slam tournaments to [[Ivan Lendl]], losing straight-set quarterfinals at both the 1987 [[U.S. Open (tennis)|US Open]] and the 1989 Australian Open and a long four-set match, played over two days, in the fourth round of the 1988 French Open. Rumors of [[drug abuse]] had begun during his second sabbatical. McEnroe denied them at the time, but acknowledged that he had used [[cocaine]] during his career in a 2000 interview that implied that the use occurred during this period, although he denied that the drug affected his play.<ref name="nyt20000130">{{cite magazine |url=http://www.julianrubinstein.com/john.html |first=Julian |last=Rubinstein |title=Being John McEnroe |magazine=[[The New York Times Magazine]] |date=January 30, 2000 |access-date=February 9, 2018}}</ref>

Nevertheless, McEnroe had multiple notable victories in the final years of his career. In the 1988 French Open, McEnroe beat 16-year-old [[Michael Chang]] 6–0, 6–3, 6–1 in the third round; Chang went on to win the title the next year. In 1989, McEnroe won a record fifth title at the [[World Championship Tennis#WCT Year-End Championship Finals|World Championship Tennis Finals]] (the championship tournament of the WCT tour, which was being staged for the last time), defeating top-ranked Lendl in the semifinals. At Wimbledon, he defeated Mats Wilander in a four-set quarterfinal before losing to [[Stefan Edberg]] in a semifinal. He won the RCA Championships in [[Indianapolis]] and reached the final of the [[Canada Masters|Canadian Open]], where he lost to Lendl. He also won both of his singles rubbers in the quarterfinal [[Davis Cup]] tie with Sweden.

Controversy was never far from McEnroe, however; in his fourth-round match against [[Mikael Pernfors]] at the 1990 Australian Open, McEnroe was ejected from the tournament for swearing at the umpire, supervisor, and referee.<ref name="nyt20000130"/> He was warned by the umpire for intimidating a lineswoman, and then docked a point for smashing a racket. McEnroe was apparently unaware that a new Code of Conduct, which had been introduced just before the tournament, meant that a third code violation would not lead to the deduction of a game but instead would result in immediate disqualification; therefore, when McEnroe unleashed a volley of abuse at umpire Gerry Armstrong, he was defaulted. He was also fined $6,500 for the incidents.<ref>{{cite news |title=Boom!

Later that year, McEnroe reached the semifinals of the [[U.S. Open (tennis)|US Open]], losing to the eventual champion, [[Pete Sampras]], in four sets. He also won the [[Davidoff Swiss Indoors]] in [[Basel]], defeating [[Goran Ivanišević]] in a five-set final. The last time McEnroe was ranked in the top ten was on October 22, 1990, when he was ranked 9th. His end-of-year singles ranking was 13th.

In 1991, McEnroe won the last edition of the Volvo Tennis-Chicago tournament by defeating his brother Patrick in the final. He won both of his singles rubbers in the quarterfinal Davis Cup tie with Spain. He reached the fourth round at Wimbledon (losing to Edberg) and the third round at the US Open (losing to Chang in a five-set night match). His end-of-year singles ranking was No. 28.

In 1992, McEnroe defeated third-ranked and defending champion [[Boris Becker]] in the third round of the Australian Open 6–4, 6–3, 7–5 before a sell-out crowd. In the fourth round, McEnroe needed 4 hours 42 minutes to defeat ninth-ranked [[Emilio Sánchez]] 8–6 in the fifth set. He lost to [[Wayne Ferreira]] in the quarterfinals. At Wimbledon, McEnroe reached the semifinals where he lost in straight sets to the eventual champion [[Andre Agassi]]. McEnroe teamed with [[Michael Stich]] to win his fifth Wimbledon men's doubles title in a record-length 5-hour-1-minute final, which the pair won 5–7, 7–6, 3–6, 7–6, 19–17. At the end of the year, he teamed with Sampras to win the doubles rubber in the Davis Cup final, where the U.S. defeated Switzerland 3–1.

McEnroe retired from the professional tour at the end of 1992. He ended his singles career ranked No. 20. He played in one tournament in 1994 as a wildcard at the [[Rotterdam Open]], losing in the first round. This was his last singles match on the ATP Tour.

After Steffi Graf won the French Open in 1999, McEnroe suggested to her that they play mixed doubles at Wimbledon. He and Graf reached the semi-finals of the 1999 Wimbledon mixed doubles but withdrew at that stage because Graf, who was the losing finalist to Lindsay Davenport, decided to focus on her singles draw.

===After retirement from the tour===
[[File: McEnroe Serving cr.jpg|right|thumb|170px|John McEnroe serving during a Champions Cup Boston match, 2007]]
After retiring, McEnroe pursued his post-tour goal of becoming a working musician. He had learned to play guitar with the help of friends like [[Eddie Van Halen]] and [[Eric Clapton]]. During his divorce, McEnroe formed The Johnny Smyth Band with himself as lead singer and guitarist, began writing songs, and played small [[gig (musical performance)|gigs]] in cities where he played with the senior tour. Although [[Lars Ulrich]] complimented his "natural instinct for music", a bar owner where McEnroe's band played said that "he couldn't sing to save his life." The band toured for two years, but McEnroe suddenly quit in 1997 just before finishing his first album.<ref name="nyt20000130"/>

McEnroe was inducted into the [[International Tennis Hall of Fame]] in 1999. He is now a [[sports commentator]] at [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]] for the [[BBC Sport|BBC]] in the UK. He also provides commentary at the [[Australian Open]], [[US Open (tennis)|US Open]] and lesser ATP tennis tournaments in the US on networks such as CBS, NBC, [[USA Network|USA]], and [[ESPN]], as does his brother Patrick.

[[File:McEnroe John.jpg|left|thumb|200px|John McEnroe in the 2007 Madrid Masters Senior]]
McEnroe became the U.S. Davis Cup captain in September 1999. His team barely escaped defeat in their first two outings in 2000, beating [[Zimbabwe]] and the Czech Republic in tight 3–2 encounters. They were then defeated 5–0 by Spain in the semifinals. McEnroe resigned in November 2000 after 14 months as captain, citing frustration with the Davis Cup schedule and format as two of his primary reasons. His brother Patrick took over the job.

In 2002, McEnroe played himself in ''[[Mr. Deeds]]'' and again in 2008 in ''[[You Don't Mess with the Zohan]]''. McEnroe played himself in the 2004 movie ''[[Wimbledon (film)|Wimbledon]]''. In July 2004, McEnroe began a [[CNBC]] talk show titled ''[[McEnroe (TV series)|McEnroe]]''. The show, however, was unsuccessful, twice earning a 0.0 [[Nielsen rating]], and was canceled within five months. In 2002, he hosted the American game show ''[[The Chair (game show)|The Chair]]'' on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] as well as the British version on [[BBC One]], but this venture also was unsuccessful.

In 2004, McEnroe said that during much of his career he had unwittingly taken [[steroids]]. He said that he had been administered these drugs without his knowledge, stating: "For six years I was unaware I was being given a form of steroid of the legal kind they used to give horses until they decided it was too strong even for horses."<ref name=Espn2004-01-14>{{cite news |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/tennis/news/story?id=1708055 |title=McEnroe says he took steroids unknowingly |website=ESPN |date=January 14, 2004 |access-date=August 15, 2012}}</ref>

McEnroe is active in philanthropy and tennis development. For years he has co-chaired the [[City Parks Foundation]]'s annual CityParks Tennis fundraiser. The charitable benefit raises crucial funds for New York City's largest municipal youth tennis programs. He collects American [[contemporary art]], and opened a [[art gallery|gallery]] in [[Manhattan]] in 1993.<ref name="nyt20000130"/>

McEnroe still plays regularly on the [[ATP Champions Tour]]. One victory came at the Jean-Luc Lagardere Trophy in Paris in 2010, where he defeated Guy Forget in the final. Playing on the Champions Tour allows him to continue his most iconic rivalries with old adversaries Ivan Lendl and Björn Borg. His last and 26th win (a record for the ATP Champions Tour) was his 2016 win at Stockholm against Thomas Muster.

In charity events and [[World Team Tennis]], he has beaten many top players, including [[Mardy Fish]] and [[Mark Philippoussis]].

In 2007, McEnroe received the [[Philippe Chatrier Award]] (the [[International Tennis Federation|ITF]]'s highest accolade) for his contributions to tennis both on and off the court. Later that year, he also appeared on the NBC comedy ''[[30 Rock]]'' as the host of a game show called "Gold Case" in which he uttered his famous line "You cannot be serious!" when a taping went awry. McEnroe also appeared on the HBO comedy ''[[Curb Your Enthusiasm]]''.

In 2009, McEnroe appeared on ''30 Rock'' again, in the episode "[[Gavin Volure]]", where the title character, a mysterious, reclusive businessman (played by [[Steve Martin]]) invites him to dinner because he bridges the worlds of "art collecting and yelling."{{cn|date=August 2020}}

In 2010, he founded the [[John McEnroe Tennis Academy]] on [[Randall's Island]] in New York City.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/new-york/tennis/news/story?id=5521560 |title=John McEnroe starts tennis academy in Randall's Island |website=ESPN.com |date=September 2, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Araton |first=Harvey |title=Building the Next McEnroe |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/08/sports/tennis/08tennis.html?_r=1& |access-date=October 25, 2014 |newspaper=The New York Times |date=May 7, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://content.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,2014403,00.html |title=Can John McEnroe's Tennis Academy Lift U.S. Talent? |date=August 30, 2010 |magazine=[[Time (magazine)|TIME]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://nymag.com/news/sports/67633/ |title=How John McEnroe Plans to Save Tennis by Opening a Tennis Academy on Randall's Island |magazine=[[New York (magazine)|New York]] |first=Larry |last=Platt |date=August 22, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Pagliaro |first=Richard |url=http://www.tennisnow.com/News/Featured-News/John-McEnroe-Tennis-Academy-Launches-On-NYC-s-Rand.aspx |title=John McEnroe Tennis Academy Launches On NYC's Randall's Island |access-date=October 25, 2014 |website=Tennis Now |date=May 20, 2010}}</ref>

In 2012, McEnroe, commentating for ESPN, heavily criticized Australian tennis player [[Bernard Tomic]] for "[[Match fixing|tanking]]" against [[Andy Roddick]] at the [[2012 US Open (tennis)|US Open]]. However, Tomic was cleared of any wrongdoing, saying that he was "simply overwhelmed by the occasion" (this was the first time that he had played at [[Arthur Ashe Stadium]]).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-09-02/officials-clear-tomic-of-tanking/4238374 |title=Officials clear Tomic of tanking |website=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]]|date=September 2, 2012 |access-date=February 9, 2018}}</ref>

McEnroe was part of [[Milos Raonic|Milos Raonic's]] coaching team from May to August 2016.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/sports/tennis/mcenroe-ends-coaching-partnership-with-canadian-milos-raonic/article31589953/ |title=McEnroe ends coaching partnership with Canadian Milos Raonic |first=Toby |last=Melville |date=August 29, 2016 |newspaper=[[The Globe and Mail]] |access-date=February 9, 2018}}</ref>

In addition to his other commentary roles, McEnroe was a central figure for Australian television network [[Nine Network|Nine]]'s coverage of the 2019/2020 [[Australian Open]].<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.bandt.com.au/media/john-mcenroe-jim-courier-head-nines-australian-open-coverage | title=John McEnroe & Jim Courier to head Nine's Australian Open coverage | access-date=January 7, 2019|work=B&T Magazine}}</ref>

===Return to the tour===
McEnroe returned to the [[Association of Tennis Professionals|ATP]] Tour in 2006 to play two doubles tournaments. In his first tournament, he teamed with [[Jonas Björkman]] to win the title at the [[SAP Open]] in San Jose.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.hindu.com/2006/02/21/stories/2006022100112100.htm |newspaper=[[The Hindu]] |date=February 21, 2006 |title=McEnroe hasn't lost his touch or tongue |access-date=April 17, 2009}}</ref> This was McEnroe's 78th doubles title (No. 5 in history) and his first title since capturing the [[Paris Masters|Paris Indoor]] doubles title in November 1992 with his brother Patrick. The win meant that McEnroe had won doubles titles in four different decades.

In his second tournament, McEnroe and Björkman lost in the quarterfinals of the tournament in Stockholm.

McEnroe won the over-45 legends doubles competition at the French Open in 2012. He was partnered with his brother Patrick. They beat Guy Forget and Henri Leconte 7–6, 6–3. McEnroe and his brother Patrick won again at the 2014 French Open in the over-45 legends doubles competition. They beat Andres Gomez and Mark Woodforde 4–6, 7–5, 1–0 (10–7)<ref>{{cite web |title=John McEnroe Player Summary |url=http://www.rolandgarros.com/en_FR/players/overview/atpm047.html#ma |website=Roland Garros |access-date=June 12, 2014}}</ref>

==Personal life==
McEnroe was married to Academy Award winner [[Tatum O'Neal]], the daughter of actor [[Ryan O'Neal]], from 1986 to 1994. They had three children, Kevin, Sean and Emily. After their divorce, they were awarded joint custody of the children, but in 1998 McEnroe was awarded sole custody.<ref name="tatum">{{cite web |url=https://abcnews.go.com/2020/story?id=123558&page=1 |title=Tatum O'Neal Responds to McEnroe 'Tell-All' |website=[[ABC News]] |date=September 4, 2004 |access-date=June 4, 2016}}</ref>

McEnroe's fiery temper has led to him being parodied in popular culture:
*In 1982, British impressionist [[Roger Kitter]] and  [[Kaplan Kaye]], under the name of "The Brat", recorded the single ''[[Chalk Dust - The Umpire Strikes Back]]'' in which Kitter parodied McEnroe losing his temper during a match. The single reached the UK Top 20 and was a Top 10 hit in the [[Netherlands]], [[Belgium]] and [[South Africa]].
*His bursts of rage were parodied in the satirical British programme ''[[Spitting Image]]'', on which he and wife Tatum frequently screamed and threw things at each other.
*Another parody was in the satirical British programme ''[[Not the Nine O'Clock News]]'', portrayed by [[Griff Rhys Jones]], showing him as a boy arguing with his parents over breakfast.
*Punk band [[End of a Year]] references his famous temper in the song "McEnroe".
*He mocked himself in a [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals|PETA]] ad promoting spay and neuter, by launching into one of his famous tirades when challenged about his decision to have his dog fixed.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2005-08-28/news/0508280320_1_homeless-animals-cats-and-dogs-john-mcenroe |title=McEnroe Mouths Off for PETA |newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]] |date=August 28, 2005}}</ref>
* Sir [[Ian McKellen]] used McEnroe as a model when playing Coriolanus for the Royal Shakespeare Company in 1984.
* In preparation for some aspects of the title role of the film ''[[Amadeus (film)|Amadeus]]'', actor [[Tom Hulce]] studied footage of John McEnroe's on-court tennis [[tantrum]]s.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}
* In 2006, McEnroe appeared in a television advert campaign for [[National Car Rental]], expressing one of his outbursts, saying "Any Car? You cannot be serious!" The following year, McEnroe appeared in an advertisement for [[Telstra]] in Australia.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/business/rap-for-telstra-over-ad-promise/2007/08/24/1187462526624.html |title=Rap for Telstra over ad promise |date=August 25, 2007 |first=Matt |last=O'Sullivan |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]}}</ref>
* In late 2013, he starred in a television commercial campaign for the [[UK]] based gadget insurance company [[Protect Your Bubble]]. In the TV adverts, he emulated his on-court outbursts.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/jan/11/protect-your-bubble-advert |title=The new Protect Your Bubble advert |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |access-date=May 28, 2014}}</ref>
* In 2014 he appeared as a guitarist on the [[Stockholm (Chrissie Hynde album)|solo debut album]] of [[Chrissie Hynde]], lead singer of [[The Pretenders]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/may/25/chrissie-hynde-pretenders-john-mcenroe|title=Chrissie Hynde: how I got to play musical doubles with McEnroe|last=Khomami|first=Nadia|date=May 24, 2014|work=The Observer|access-date=May 2, 2019|language=en-GB|issn=0029-7712}}</ref>
