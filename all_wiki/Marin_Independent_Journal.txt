==History==
The ''Independent Journal'' was formed from the merger of the ''Marin Journal'' and the ''San Rafael Daily Independent'' in 1948.  The weekly ''Journal,'' one of the state's oldest newspapers, had been established in 1861 as the ''Marin County Journal.''  The ''Journal'' was published in [[San Rafael, California|San Rafael]] on Saturdays by Jerome A. Barney.<ref>[http://files.usgwarchives.org/ca/marin/history/1880/historyo/historyo485nms.txt James Munro-Fraser, ''History of Marin County, California,'' "History Of San Rafael Township, Part 1," 1880] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719014938/http://files.usgwarchives.org/ca/marin/history/1880/historyo/historyo485nms.txt |date=2011-07-19 }}, accessed June 7, 2008</ref>   The ''Independent'' had been started by Harry Granice in 1900 as the weekly ''San Rafael Independent,'' which became a daily by 1903 under the management of his daughter, Celeste Granice Murphy.  The merged paper was originally called the ''San Rafael Independent-Journal''.<ref>[http://www.cnpa.com/CalPress/hall/craemer.htm [[California Newspaper Publishers Association]],  California Press Association Hall of Fame, "Justus F. Craemer, San Rafael Independent-Journal, Orange Daily News, 1886-1966"]{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, accessed June 6, 2008</ref><ref>[http://www.cnpa.com/CalPress/hall/cmurphy.htm [[California Newspaper Publishers Association]],  California Press Association Hall of Fame, "Celeste Granice Murphy, The Sonoma Index-Tribune, 1882-1962 "]{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, accessed June 6, 2008</ref>

[[Gannett Company|Gannett]] acquired the paper from the Brown family in 1980. [[MediaNews Group]] acquired the paper from Gannett in 2000. Gannett turned over the newspaper to a partnership headed by Dean Singleton and it is now owned and operated by a company made up of investment bankers.

===The "hot-tubber" incident===
In 2002,  former [[President of the United States|President]] [[George H. W. Bush]] described "American Taliban" [[John Walker Lindh]] as "some misguided Marin County hot-tubber."<ref name="guardian">[https://www.theguardian.com/elsewhere/journalist/story/0,7792,756218,00.html "From hot tub to hot water" | World news | guardian.co.uk<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> His comment prompted criticism among readers of the ''Marin Independent Journal'', until Bush sent the paper a letter of apology:
:Call off the dogs, please. I surrender...I apologize. I am chastened and will never use 'hot tub' and 'Marin county' in the same sentence again.<ref name="guardian" />
