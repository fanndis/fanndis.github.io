'''''{{Lang|fr|La fille du régiment}}''''' (''The Daughter of the Regiment'') is an [[opéra comique]] in two acts by [[Gaetano Donizetti]], set to a French [[libretto]] by [[Jules-Henri Vernoy de Saint-Georges]] and [[Jean-François Bayard]]. It was first performed on 11 February 1840 by the Paris [[Opéra-Comique]] at the [[Salle de la Bourse]].

The opera was written by Donizetti while he was living in Paris between 1838 and 1840 preparing a revised version of his then-unperformed Italian opera, ''[[Poliuto]]'', as ''[[Les martyrs]]'' for the [[Paris Opéra]]. Since ''Martyrs'' was delayed, the composer had time to write the music for ''La fille du régiment'', his first opera set to a French text, as well as to stage the French version of ''[[Lucia di Lammermoor]]'' as ''Lucie de Lammermoor''.

''La fille du régiment'' quickly became a popular success partly because of the famous [[aria]] "''Ah! mes amis, quel jour de fête!''", which requires the tenor to sing no fewer than eight [[Tenor C|high Cs]] – a frequently sung ninth is not written.<ref>[https://www.apnews.com/471ef43dd2fa480fbfc82f16319c669d "Tenor on top of the high C’s in Donizetti opera"] by Mike Silverman, [[AP News]], 5 February 2019</ref> ''{{Lang|it|La figlia del reggimento}}'', a slightly different Italian-language version (in translation by [[Calisto Bassi]]), was adapted to the tastes of the Italian public.

[[File:Marie-Julie Halligner-small.png|thumb|Marie–Julie Halligner sang The Marquise of Berkenfield.]]
The opening night was "a barely averted disaster."<ref>Ashbrook 1982, p. 146.</ref> Apparently the lead tenor was frequently off pitch.<ref>Ashbrook 1982, p. 651, note 45.</ref> The noted French tenor [[Gilbert Duprez]], who was present, later observed in his ''Souvenirs d'un chanteur'': "Donizetti often swore to me how his self-esteem as a composer had suffered in Paris. He was never treated there according to his merits. I myself saw the unsuccess, almost the collapse, of ''La fille du régiment''."<ref>Gilbert Duprez, ''Souvenirs d'un chanteur'', 1880, [https://archive.org/stream/souvenirsdunchan00dupr#page/95/mode/1up p. 95] (at the [[Internet Archive]]).</ref><ref name=Ashbrook146>Quoted and translated by Ashbrook 1982, p. 146.</ref>

It received a highly negative review from the French critic and composer [[Hector Berlioz]] (''[[Journal des débats]]'', 16 February 1840), who claimed it could not be taken seriously by either the public or its composer, although Berlioz did concede that some of the music, "the little waltz that serves as the entr'acte and the trio ''dialogué'' ... lack neither vivacity nor freshness."<ref name=Ashbrook146/> The source of Berlioz's hostility is revealed later in his review:
<blockquote>What, two major scores for the [[Paris Opera|Opéra]], ''[[Les martyrs]]'' and ''[[Le duc d'Albe]]'', two others at the [[Théâtre de la Renaissance]], ''[[Lucie de Lammermoor]]'' and ''[[L'ange de Nisida]]'', two at the Opéra-Comique, ''La fille du régiment'' and another whose title is still unknown, and yet another for the [[Théâtre-Italien]], will have been written or transcribed in one year by the same composer! M[onsieur] Donizetti seems to treat us like a conquered country; it is a veritable invasion. One can no longer speak of the opera houses of Paris, but only of the opera houses of M[onsieur] Donizetti.<ref name=Ashbrook146/></blockquote>

The critic and poet [[Théophile Gautier]], who was not a rival composer, had a somewhat different point of view: "M[onsieur] Donizetti is capable of paying with music that is beautiful and worthy for the cordial hospitality which France offers him in all her theatres, subsidized or not."<ref>Ashbrook 1982, p. 651, note 46.</ref>

Despite its bumpy start, the opera soon became hugely popular at the Opéra-Comique. During its first 80 years, it reached its 500th performance at the theatre in 1871 and its 1,000th in 1908.<ref>Wolff, S. ''Un demi-siècle d'opéra-comique (1900–1950).'' Paris: André Bonne, 1953, pp. 76–77</ref>

===Outside France===
The opera was first performed in Italy at [[La Scala]], Milan, on 3 October 1840, in Italian with recitatives by Donizetti replacing the spoken dialogue.<ref>Ashbrook 1982, p. 568; Warrack & West 1992, p. 243 (recitatives by Donizetti); Loewenberg 1978, column 804, has 30 October 1840 for Milan.</ref> It was thought "worthless" and received only six performances. It was not until 1928 when [[Toti Dal Monte]] sang Marie that the opera began to be appreciated in Italy.<ref>Ashbrook 1982, p. 651, note 50.</ref>

''La fille du régiment'' received its first performance in America on 7 March 1843 at the [[Théâtre d'Orléans]] in New Orleans.<ref>Loewenberg 1978, column 805; Warrack & West 1992, p. 243.</ref> The New Orleans company premiered the work in New York City on 19 July 1843 with [[Julie Calvé]] as Marie.<ref>Loewenberg 1978, column 805.</ref> The ''[[Spirit of the Times]]'' (22 July) counted it a great success, and, although the score was "thin" and not up to the level of ''[[Anna Bolena]]'' or ''[[L'elisir d'amore]]'', some of Donizetti's "gems" were to be found in it.<ref>Lawrence, 1988, p. 215.</ref> The ''[[New York Herald|Herald]]'' (21 July) was highly enthusiastic, especially in its praise of Calvé: "Applause is an inadequate term, ... vehement cheering rewarded this talented prima donna."<ref>Quoted in Lawrence, 1988, p. 215.</ref> Subsequently the opera was performed frequently in New York, the role of Marie being a favorite with [[Jenny Lind]], [[Henriette Sontag]], [[Pauline Lucca]], [[Anna Thillon]] and [[Adelina Patti]].<ref>Kobbé 1919, [https://archive.org/stream/completeoperabo00kobbgoog#page/n429/mode/1up p. 355]; Lawrence 1995, p. 226 (Anna Thillon).</ref>

First given in England in Italian, it appeared on 27 May 1847 at [[Her Majesty's Theatre]] in London (with Jenny Lind and [[Luigi Lablache]]). Later—on 21 December 1847 in English—it was presented at the [[Surrey Theatre]] in London.<ref>Loewenberg 1978, column 805 (both London performances); Warrack & West 1992, p. 243 (Her Majesty's in London with Lind and Lablache).</ref>

[[W. S. Gilbert]] wrote a [[Victorian burlesque|burlesque]] adaptation of the opera, ''[[La Vivandière (Gilbert)|La Vivandière]]'', in 1867.

===20th century and beyond===
[[File:La fille du regiment 1910 poster.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|1910 poster for the opera by Emile Finot]]
The [[Metropolitan Opera]] gave the first performances with [[Marcella Sembrich]], and [[Charles Gilibert]] (Sulpice) during the 1902/03 season. It was then followed by performances at the [[Manhattan Opera House]] in 1909 with [[Luisa Tetrazzini]], [[John McCormack (tenor)|John McCormack]], and Charles Gilibert, and again with [[Frieda Hempel]] and [[Antonio Scotti]] in the same roles at the Met on 17 December 1917.<ref>Kobbé 1919, p. 355.</ref>

It was revived at the [[Royal Opera, London]], in 1966 for [[Joan Sutherland]]. On 13 February 1970, in concert at [[Carnegie Hall]], [[Beverly Sills]] sang the first performance in New York since [[Lily Pons]] performed it at the [[Metropolitan Opera House (39th Street)|Metropolitan Opera House]] in 1943.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.beverlysillsonline.com/|title=Beverly Sills – beverlysillsonline.com – Biography, Discography, Annals, Pictures, Articles, News|website=www.beverlysillsonline.com}}</ref><ref>[http://archives.metoperafamily.org/archives/frame.htm Metropolitan Opera archives database]</ref>

This opera is famous for the aria "{{Lang|fr|Ah! mes amis, quel jour de fête!|italic=yes}}" (sometimes referred to as "{{Lang|fr|Pour mon âme|italic=yes}}"), which has been called the "Mount Everest" for tenors. It features eight [[Tenor C|high Cs]] (a ninth, frequently inserted, is not written). [[Luciano Pavarotti]] broke through to stardom via his 1972 performance alongside Joan Sutherland at the Met, when he "leapt over the '[[Becher's Brook]]' of the string of high Cs with an aplomb that left everyone gasping."<ref>[[James Naughtie]], [http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/music/article2400764.ece "Goodbye Pavarotti: Forget the Pavarotti with Hankies. He was Better Younger"], ''[[The Times]]'' (London), 7 September 2007. Retrieved 22 April 2008</ref>

As a non-singing role, the Duchess of Crakenthorp is often played by non-operatic celebrities, including actresses such as [[Dawn French]], [[Bea Arthur]], [[Hermione Gingold]], and [[Kathleen Turner]], or by retired opera greats such as [[Kiri Te Kanawa]] and [[Montserrat Caballé]]. In 2016, [[Supreme Court of the United States|US Supreme Court]] Justice [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]], a lifelong opera fan, played the Duchess on opening night of the [[Washington National Opera]]'s production.<ref>{{cite news|title=Standing ovation greets Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg cameo in DC opera|url=https://www.theguardian.com/law/2016/nov/13/ruth-bader-ginsburg-washington-opera-supreme-court|date=14 November 2016|accessdate=15 November 2016|work=[[The Guardian]]}}</ref>

===Act 1===
{{Listen|type=music|filename=Donizetti - Le beau vingt-et-unième (extrait de la Fille du régiment) - Atelier Vocal des Herbiers ( petit ensemble Amarante) - juin 2000.ogg|title=Le beau vingt-et-unième|description=performed by l'Atelier Vocal des Herbiers and piano accompaniment}}

War is raging in the [[Tyrol–South Tyrol–Trentino Euroregion|Tyrols]] and the [[Marquise]] of Berkenfield, who is traveling in the area, is alarmed to the point of needing smelling salts to be administered by her faithful steward, Hortensius. While a chorus of villagers express their fear, the Marquise does the same: ''Pour une femme de mon nom'' / "For a lady of my family, what a time, alas, is war-time". As the French can be seen to be moving away, all express their relief. Suddenly, and provoking the fear of the remaining women who scatter, Sergeant Sulpice of the Twenty-First Regiment of the French army [in the Italian version it is the Eleventh] arrives and assures everyone that the regiment will restore order.

Marie, the [[vivandière]] (canteen girl) of the Regiment, enters, and Sulpice is happy to see her: ([[duet]]: Sulpice and Marie: ''Mais, qui vient? Tiens, Marie, notre fille'' / "But who is this? Well, well, if it isn't our daughter Marie"). Then, as he questions her about a young man she has been seen with, she identifies him as Tonio, a Tyrolean [in the Italian version: Swiss]. At that moment, Tonio is brought in as a prisoner, because he has been seen prowling around the camp. Marie saves him from the soldiers, who demand that he must die, by explaining that he had saved her life when she nearly fell while mountain-climbing. All toast Tonio, who pledges allegiance to France, and Marie is encouraged to sing the regimental song: (aria: ''Chacun le sait, chacun le dit'' / "Everyone knows it, everyone says it"). Sulpice leads the soldiers off, taking Tonio with them, but he runs back to join her. She quickly tells him that he must gain the approval of her "fathers": the soldiers of the Regiment, who found her on the battlefield as an abandoned baby, and adopted her. He proclaims his love for her (aria, then love duet with Marie: ''Depuis l'instant où, dans mes bras'' / "Ever since that moment when you fell and / I caught you, all trembling in my arms..."), and then the couple express their love for each other.

At that point, Sulpice returns, surprising the young couple, who leave. The Marquise arrives with Hortensius, initially afraid of the soldier, but is calmed by him. The Marquise explains that they are trying to return to her castle and asks for an escort. When hearing the name Berkenfield, Sulpice immediately recognizes it from a letter found with Marie as an infant. It is discovered that Marie is actually the Marquise's long-lost niece.  Marie returns and is surprised to be introduced to her aunt. The Marquise commands that Marie accompany her and that she will be taught to be a proper lady. Marie bids farewell to her beloved regiment just as Tonio enters announcing that he has enlisted in their ranks: (aria: ''Ah! mes amis, quel jour de fête'' / "Ah, my friends, what an exciting day"). When he proclaims his love for Marie, the soldiers are horrified, but agree to his pleading for her hand. However, they tell him that she is about to leave with her aunt: (Marie, aria: ''Il faut partir'' / "I must leave you!"). In a choral finale in which all join, she leaves with the Marquise and Tonio is enraged.

===Act 2===
Marie has been living in the Marquise's castle for several months. In a conversation with Sulpice, the Marquise describes how she has sought to modify most of Marie's military manners and make her into a lady of fashion, suitable to be married to her nephew, the Duke of Crakenthorp. Although reluctant, Marie has agreed and Sulpice is asked to encourage her. Marie enters and is asked to play the piano, but appears to prefer more martial music when encouraged by Sulpice and sings the regimental song. The Marquise sits down at the piano and attempts to work through the piece with Marie who becomes more and more distracted and, along with Sulpice, takes up the regimental song.

Marie is left alone: (aria: ''Par le rang et par l'opulence'' / "They have tried in vain to dazzle me"). As she is almost reconciled to her fate, she hears martial music and is joyously happy (cabaletta: ''Oh! transport! oh! douce ivresse'' / "Oh bliss! oh ectasy!"), and the Regiment arrives. With it is Tonio, now an officer. The soldiers express their joy at seeing Marie, and Marie, Tonio and Sulpice are joyfully reunited (trio, Marie, Sulpice, Tonio: ''Tous les trois réunis'' / "We three are reunited"). Tonio mentions he has just learned a secret, via his uncle the burgermeister, that he cannot reveal. 

The Marquise enters, horrified to see soldiers. Tonio asks for Marie's hand, explaining that he risked his life for her (aria, Tonio: ''Pour me rapprocher de Marie, je m'enrôlai, pauvre soldat'' / "In order to woo Marie, I enlisted in the ranks"), but she dismisses him scornfully. Tonio reveals that he knows that the Marquise never had a niece. She orders him to leave and Marie to return to her chambers; after they leave, the Marquise confesses the truth to Sulpice: Marie is her own illegitimate daughter. In the circumstances, Sulpice promises that Marie will agree to her mother's wishes.

The Duchess of Crakenthorp, her son the groom-to-be, and the wedding entourage arrive at the Marquise's castle. Marie enters with Sulpice, who has given her the news that the Marquise is her mother. Marie embraces her and decides she must obey. But at the last minute the soldiers of the Regiment storm in (chorus: soldiers, then Tonio: ''Au secours de notre fille'' / "Our daughter needs our help") and reveal that Marie was a canteen girl. The wedding guests are offended by that fact, but are then impressed when Marie sings of her debt to the soldiers (aria, Marie: ''Quand le destin, au milieu de la guerre'' / "When fate, in the confusion of war, threw me, a baby, into their arms"). The Marquise is deeply moved, admits she is Marie's mother, and gives her consent to Marie and Tonio, amid universal rejoicing (final chorus: ''Salut à la France!'' / "Hurrah for France! For happy times!").<ref>[http://www.metopera.org/metopera/history/stories/synopsis.aspx?customid=440 Synopsis] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140903111809/http://www.metopera.org/metopera/history/stories/synopsis.aspx?customid=440 |date=3 September 2014 }} in part from the Metropolitan Opera as well as the booklet accompanying the 1967 Decca recording.</ref>
