'''Clube de Regatas do Flamengo''' ({{IPA-pt|ˈklubi dʒi ʁeˈɡataʒ du flaˈmẽɡu|br}}; English: ''Flamengo Rowing Club''), commonly referred to as '''Flamengo''', is a Brazilian sports club based in [[Rio de Janeiro]], in the neighbourhood of [[Gávea]], best known for their professional [[association football|football]] team.

The club was first established in 1895 as a [[Rowing (sport)|rowing]] club and played their first official match in 1912. Flamengo's traditional uniform features red and black striped shirts with white shorts, and red and black striped socks. Flamengo has typically played their home matches in the [[Maracanã Stadium|Maracanã]], the national stadium of Brazil, since its completion in 1950, with some exceptions in recent years. Since 1969, the vulture (Portuguese: ''urubu'') has been the most recognized mascot of Flamengo.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.torcidaflamengo.com.br/news.asp?nID=3339 |title=Curiosidade: A história do Urubu, símbolo do Flamengo |website=torcidaflamengo.com.br |access-date=March 11, 2019}}</ref>

Flamengo established themselves as one of Brazil's most successful sports clubs in the 20th century during of the era of [[state football leagues in Brazil|state leagues in Brazil]] when they captured several [[Campeonato Carioca]] (Rio de Janeiro state league) titles prior to the establishment of the first Brazilian national football championship in 1971. Since then, they have remained successful in [[List of Brazilian football champions|Brazilian football]], having won 7 [[Campeonato Brasileiro Série A]], 3 [[Copa do Brasil]], and a record 36 Campeonato Carioca. They are one of three clubs to have [[List of unrelegated association football clubs|never been relegated]] from the ''Brasileirão''. In South American and worldwide competitions, the club's highest achievements are their conquests of the 1981 and 2019 [[Copa Libertadores]], and 1981 [[Intercontinental Cup (football)|Intercontinental Cup]] against [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]], led by the club's most iconic player [[Zico (footballer)|Zico]]. Flamengo's fiercest and longest-standing rivalries are with the other "[[Football in Rio de Janeiro|Big Four]]" of Rio de Janeiro: [[Fluminense Football Club|Fluminense]], [[Botafogo de Futebol e Regatas|Botafogo]] and [[Club de Regatas Vasco da Gama|Vasco da Gama]].

Flamengo is the most popular club in Brazil, with over 40.2 million supporters as of 2020.<ref>{{cite web|title=FIFA highlights Flamengo in the semifinals: "Only team in the world with 40 million fans"|url=https://globoesporte.globo.com/futebol/times/flamengo/noticia/fifa-destaca-supertime-do-flamengo-nas-semis-unico-time-no-mundo-com-40-milhoes-de-torcedores.ghtml|accessdate=4 October 2020|language=pt}}</ref> 2017, it is also Brazil's richest football club with an annual revenue of [[Brazilian real|R$]]648.0&nbsp;million ([[Euro|€]]163.04&nbsp;million)<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://exame.abril.com.br/negocios/flamengo-e-o-time-que-mais-arrecada-dinheiro-no-brasil-revela-pesquisa/ |title=Flamengo é o time que mais fatura no Brasil |first=Clara |last=Cerioni |access-date=July 18, 2018}}</ref> and a valuation of over [[Brazilian real|R$]]1.69&nbsp;million ([[Euro|€]]425.21&nbsp;million).<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://sportv.globo.com/site/programas/selecao-sportv/noticia/estudo-coloca-o-flamengo-como-a-marca-mais-valiosa-do-futebol-brasileiro-em-2017.ghtml |title=Estudo coloca o Flamengo como a marca mais valiosa do futebol brasileiro em 201 |publisher=Globoesporte.globo.com |access-date=July 18, 2018}}</ref>

==History==

=== Establishment of the club (1895–1912) ===
Flamengo was founded on November 17, 1895, by a group of rowers gathered at club member Nestor de Barros's manor on [[Flamengo, Rio de Janeiro|Flamengo Beach]] in Rio de Janeiro. In the late 19th century, [[Rowing (sport)|rowing]] was the elite sport in the region and the group hoped to impress the young women of the city's high society by establishing a rowing club. Previously, they could only afford a used boat named ''Pherusa'', which had to be completely rebuilt before it could be used in competition. The team debuted on October 6, 1895, when they sailed off the [[Caju, Rio de Janeiro|Caju Point]] toward Flamengo Beach. However, strong winds turned over the boat and the rowers nearly drowned. They were rescued by a fishing boat named ''Leal'' (Loyal). Later as the ''Pherusa'' was undergoing repairs, it was stolen and never found again. The group saved money to buy a new boat, the ''Etoile'', renamed ''Scyra''.
[[File:Flamengo 1912.jpg|thumb|The recently formed [[Association football|football]] (soccer) team before a match vs. Paissandu, 1912.]]
On the night of November 17, the group gathered at Nestor de Barros's manor on Flamengo beach and founded the ''Grupo de Regatas do Flamengo'' (English: ''Flamengo Rowing Group'') and elected its first board and president (Domingos Marques de Azevedo). The name was changed a few weeks later to its current title of ''Clube de Regatas do Flamengo'' (''Flamengo Rowing Club''). The founders decided that the anniversary of the club's foundation should be commemorated on November 15 to coincide with [[Proclamation of the Republic (Brazil)|Republic Proclamation Day]], a national holiday.

Flamengo's football team was only established after a group of ten dissatisfied players from [[Fluminense Football Club|Fluminense]] broke away from that club following a dispute with its board.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://seuhistory.com/hoje-na-historia/fundado-o-clube-de-regatas-do-flamengo |title=Fundado o Clube de Regatas do Flamengo |publisher=History Channel |access-date=September 1, 2016}}</ref> The players decided to join Flamengo because Alberto Borgerth, the team's captain, was also a rower for Flamengo. Also, establishing a land sports department at Flamengo was preferable to joining football rivals [[Botafogo de Futebol e Regatas|Botafogo]] or the all-English club [[Paissandu Atlético Clube|Paissandu]]. The new members were admitted on November 8, 1911. A motion against the club taking part in football tournaments was defeated, and as a result the members officially established the team on December 24, 1911.

=== Football in the amateur era (1912–1933) ===
[[File:1914 - Flamengo.jpg|right|thumb|The Flamengo team of 1914, when the club won its first [[Campeonato Carioca|Carioca championship]].]]
The new team trained on {{ill|Russel Beach|pt|Praia do Russel}} and gradually gained the support of the locals, who closely watched their practice matches. The first official match was played on May 3, 1912, and marked, to this day, the largest margin of victory in the club's history, as they defeated [[Sport Club Mangueira|Mangueira]] 16–2. Flamengo's first ever match against [[Fluminense FC|Fluminense]], the start of the [[Fla-Flu]] rivalry, was played on July 7 of that year and was won by Fluminense by a score of 3–2. That same year, Flamengo finished as runners-up of the [[Campeonato Carioca]], the Rio de Janeiro State Championship. The team's first uniform was nicknamed the "''papagaio vintém''", due to its similarity to a particular type of kite. In 1914 the club won the [[Campeonato Carioca]] for the first time, dressed in a red, black, and white-striped shirt nicknamed the "''cobra coral''" ([[coral snake]]) was worn until 1916. Flamengo won the [[Campeonato Carioca]] again in 1915, 1920, and 1921.

In 1925, the team won the Campeonato Carioca and five other tournaments, a record at the time. In 1927 the prominent Rio newspaper [[Jornal do Brasil]], in partnership with a mineral water company, held a mail-in contest to find "the most beloved club in Brazil." Though Flamengo enjoyed their largest increase in fan support after the club professionalized in the 1930s, they still defeated popular rivals [[CR Vasco da Gama|Vasco da Gama]] in the vote.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |url=http://globoesporte.globo.com/blogs/especial-blog/memoria-ec/post/flamengo-o-mais-querido-ha-90-anos.html |title=Flamengo: o mais querido há 90 anos {{!}} Blog Memória EC |website=globoesporte.com |language=pt-br |access-date=March 13, 2019}}</ref> This was the first of many times that Flamengo would be polled as the nation's most popular club, originating the nickname "''O mais querido do Brasil''" ("the most beloved of Brazil").<ref name=":1">{{Cite web |url=http://globoesporte.globo.com/futebol/times/flamengo/noticia/2015/11/fla-120-anos-o-clube-mais-querido-do-brasil-e-2-guerra-mundial.html |title=Fla 120 anos: o "Mais Querido do Brasil" e a Segunda Guerra Mundial |last=Frigols |first=Matheus |website=globoesporte.com |language=pt-br |access-date=March 14, 2019}}</ref> In 1933 the team went on its first tour outside Brazil (to [[Montevideo]] and [[Buenos Aires]]<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablesf/flamengo-satrip33.html |title=Rio de la Plata trip of CR Flamengo (Rio de Janeiro) 1933 |publisher=Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation |access-date=March 13, 2019}}</ref>) and on 14 May of the same year played its final match as an amateur team, defeating [[River Futebol Clube]] by a score of 16–2.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://futebolnacional.com.br/infobol/matchdetails.jsp?code=CE458392AC0176169E89E60A7C00AB4D&lang=pt_br |title=Flamengo 16x2 River {{!}} futebolnacional.com.br |last=Rodrigues |first=Gerson |website=futebolnacional.com.br |access-date=March 13, 2019}}</ref> After this, the club's football department became professional.

=== Early professional era (1934–1955) ===
[[File:Time de Futebol do Flamengo, 1934.tif|thumb|Flamengo's team, 1934. [[Brazilian National Archives|National Archives of Brazil.]]]]
Local advertiser [[José Bastos Padilha]] was elected club president in 1934 and served until 1937. Under his tenure, the club massively improved its popularity in both Rio de Janeiro and the entirety of Brazil. For publicity, he organized a contest for students in schools to create phrases describing Flamengo, from which the phrase ''uma vez Flamengo, Flamengo até morrer'' ("Once you are Flamengo, you are Flamengo 'til you die") was developed and would later be adopted as part of the club's anthem. In 1936 Padilha signed excellent players such as [[Domingos da Guia]] and [[Leônidas|Leônidas da Silva]] (who would go on to be the leading goalscorer in the [[1938 FIFA World Cup]] as a Flamengo player). These beloved players endeared Flamengo to the public and it is believed that by this time Flamengo was the most popular club in the country.<ref name=":0" /> In 1937 Flamengo hired Hungarian coach [[Izidor Kürschner|Izidor "Dori" Kürschner]], who introduced the [[Formation (association football)#WM|WM system]] to Brazil and other innovations from Europe such as training without the use of the ball and playing a more defensive, controlled style. Padilha facilitated the construction of Flamengo's new stadium and current training center, the [[Estádio da Gávea]]. The stadium was inaugurated on September 4, 1938, when [[CR Vasco da Gama|Vasco da Gama]] defeated Flamengo 2–0 and Kürschner was promptly fired.

In 1938, the five-year split in Rio de Janeiro football over the dispute between professionalism and amateurism was resolved with the merger of the two competing leagues (Flamengo had been a member of the professional LCF - ''Liga Carioca de Football''). In 1939, after twelve years without winning any titles, Flamengo conquered the state championship with a team that would become the basis of the three-time state champions in the 1940s.

In 1941, the group played its first international competition, the Hexagonal Tournament of Argentina.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablesf/flamengo-argtrip41.html |title=CR Flamengo (Rio de Janeiro) trip to Argentina 1941 |publisher=Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation |access-date=March 14, 2019}}</ref> In 1942, the first organized supporters group in all of Brazil, Charanga Rubro-Negra, was founded in support of Flamengo.<ref name="organizadasbrasil.com">{{Cite web |url=http://www.organizadasbrasil.com/noticia/Charanga-Rubro-Negra-a-primeira-torcida-organizada-do-Brasil-1690.html |title=Charanga Rubro-Negra: a primeira torcida organizada do Brasil |website=Organizadas Brasil |language=PT-br |access-date=March 14, 2019}}</ref> Flamengo's popularity grew incidentally during [[World War II]] when Brazil's allies the United States installed two high-powered antennas in [[Natal, Rio Grande do Norte|Natal]] and [[Belém]] in the north of Brazil to intercept enemy radio signals.<ref name=":1" /> They also allowed residents in the North and Northeast regions to receive the radio broadcasts of football matches. As Rio de Janeiro was the national capital at the time and Flamengo was highly successful in the war years with [[Zizinho]] and [[Domingos da Guia]], nationwide support increased. In 1944, Flamengo completed their first ''tricampeonato Carioca'': three consecutive Rio de Janeiro state titles (winning the 1942, 1943, and 1944 competitions).<ref name=":2">{{Cite web |url=http://www.flamengo.com.br/historia-tri-estadual |title=Os Tricampeonatos Estaduais - Flamengo |website=flamengo.com.br |language=pt-br |access-date=March 13, 2019}}</ref> The key player of this squad was [[Zizinho]], a player developed at Flamengo and considered the first ever "idol" of the club. Zizinho was transferred to [[Bangu Atlético Clube|Bangu]] just before the start of the [[1950 FIFA World Cup|1950 World Cup]] in Brazil, where he scored twice and the ''Seleção'' finished runners-up. From 1953 to 1955, Flamengo once again won the [[Campeonato Carioca|Rio de Janeiro State League]] three consecutive times.<ref name=":2" />

=== Developing talent (1956–1973) ===
Despite the lack of achievements of this period Flamengo continued to grow in influence regionally, particularly due to their popular roster of players such as [[Edvaldo Alves de Santa Rosa|Dida]], [[Carlinhos]], [[Caju (footballer, born 1949)|Caju]], [[Gérson]], [[Antônio Rondinelli]], [[Narciso Horacio Doval|Horácio Doval]], [[Fio Maravilha]], [[Evaristo de Macedo]], [[Francisco Santiago Reyes|Francisco Reyes]] and others. Throughout the 1950s, Flamengo played in several international invitational tournaments against South American and European competition.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablesr/riotri54.html |title=Torneio Triangular Internacional do Rio de Janeiro 1954 |publisher=Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation |access-date=March 14, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablesc/cardoso55.html |title=Torneio Internacional Gilberto Cardoso 1955 |publisher=Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation |access-date=March 14, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://flamengoalternativo.wordpress.com/2015/01/26/1961-houve-uma-vez-um-verao/ |title=1961: Houve uma vez um verão |last=Valle |first=Emmanuel do |date=January 26, 2015 |website=Flamengo_Alternativo |language=pt-BR |access-date=March 14, 2019}}</ref>

The top football clubs in Brazil were largely concentrated in the Rio de Janeiro and [[São Paulo]] areas. As early as 1911 there have been several inter-state cup matches between clubs from the two municipalities. In 1955 Flamengo won their first Rio-São Paulo State Champions' Cup against [[Santos FC|Santos]] and in 1961 they captured the more prestigious [[Torneio Rio – São Paulo]], which at the time assembled the best teams in Brazil and was the predecessor tournament for the eventual Brazilian Championship in 1971 (the [[1959 Campeonato Brasileiro Série A|Taça Brasil]], established in 1959, served as the current format for determining a national champion and participant in the newly formed [[Copa Libertadores|CONMEBOL Copa Libertadores]]). Flamengo won the 1963 Campeonato Carioca and qualified for the following [[1964 Campeonato Brasileiro Série A|Taça Brasil]] for the first time, finishing runners-up behind [[Pelé]]'s Santos.

In late 1968, the legendary [[Garrincha]] was signed by Flamengo on a season-long contract, but he only made 20 appearances with four goals.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://imortaisdofutebol.com/2013/03/02/esquadrao-imortal-flamengo-1953-1961/ |title=Esquadrão Imortal – Flamengo 1953–1961 |date=March 2, 2013 |publisher=Imortais do futebol |access-date=November 29, 2016}}</ref> The legacy of the club in the 1970s would be the fantastic class of young players to graduate from Flamengo's youth ranks to later form the backbone of Flamengo's "golden generation." In this period, players like [[Zico (footballer)|Zico]], [[Leovegildo Lins da Gama Júnior|Júnior]], [[José Leandro Ferreira|Leandro]] and others were promoted to the senior team.

Flamengo won their 18th Campeonato Carioca state championship in 1978. The following five years would come to represent the club's most glorious era. Brazilian stars like [[Leovegildo Lins da Gama Júnior|Júnior]], [[Paulo César Carpegiani|Carpegiani]], [[Adílio de Oliveira Gonçalves|Adílio]], [[Cláudio Adão]] and [[Milton Queiroz da Paixão|Tita]] were led by [[Zico (footballer)|Zico]] to become state champions three times in a row - the club's third tri-championship. This run of sustained excellent play pushed Flamengo towards its first [[1980 Campeonato Brasileiro Série A|Brazilian Championship in 1980]]. As national champions, the club qualified to play in the South American continental tournament, the [[1981 Copa Libertadores]], for the first time.

[[1981 Clube de Regatas do Flamengo season|The 1981 season]] is a benchmark year in Flamengo's history.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.worldsoccer.com/blogs/when-flamengo-and-zico-ruled-the-world-341585 |title=When Flamengo and Zico ruled the world |date=July 14, 2013 |publisher=WorldSoccer |access-date=September 1, 2016}}</ref> They advanced through the semi-final group stage of the Copa Libertadores with four victories in four matches.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.imortaisdofutebol.com/2012/04/21/esquadrao-imortal-flamengo-1980-1983/ |title=Esquadrão Imortal – Flamengo 1980-1983 – Imortais do Futebol |language=pt-BR |access-date=February 13, 2019}}</ref> In the final they encountered Chilean club [[Cobreloa]], also a debutante club in the tournament.

On December 13, 1981, [[Zico (footballer)|Zico]], [[Tita]], and [[Nunes (footballer)|Nunes]] took the field for the most important match in the club's history. Two goals by Nunes and one by Adílio (all in the first half) along with a brilliant midfield performance by Zico earned Flamengo the title of first Brazilian World Champions since [[Pelé]]'s [[Santos Futebol Clube|Santos]], shutting out Liverpool 3–0.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://acervo.oglobo.globo.com/em-destaque/flamengo-da-era-zico-campeao-do-mundo-ao-vencer-liverpool-em-1981-9703290 |title=Flamengo da era Zico é campeão do mundo ao vencer Liverpool em 1981 |date=August 26, 2013 |website=[[O Globo]] |access-date=November 29, 2016}}</ref>

The following two years were also marked with success.

=== National success and the return of Zico (1984–1994) ===
{{main|1987 Campeonato Brasileiro Série A}}
After two years playing in Italy for [[Udinese Calcio|Udinese]], Zico returned to the Flamengo in 1986 and won his last state championship. Only one month after returning, he suffered a severe knee injury after a violent tackle from [[Bangu Atlético Clube|Bangu]] defender Marcio Nunes, which interrupted his career for several months and affected his form in the [[1986 FIFA World Cup]].
[[File:Zico 2012.jpg|alt=|thumb|upright=0.7|[[Zico (footballer)|Zico]] played for Flamengo from 1971 to 1983 and 1985–89, setting several records for the club.]]
In 1987, Zico was a major contributor to Flamengo's victory in the first edition of the [[Copa União]]. That year, the [[Brazilian Football Confederation|CBF]] was experiencing serious financial and institutional crises and was unable to secure sponsorship to organize the national championship as in years prior. As a result, the thirteen biggest clubs in Brazil (which included Flamengo) reacted and created a new entity named the [[Clube dos 13|''Club of 13'']] to organize a championship of their own. The CBF originally supported the decision by the Club of 13, but were pressured by other clubs to create a larger national tournament. As a result, CBF placed three additional clubs into the Copa União, regarded the Copa União as the "Green Module," and organized a second "Yellow Module" of 16 other teams. CBF then decided that for the [[1987 Campeonato Brasileiro Série A|1987 Brazilian Championship]], the winners and runners-up of both modules would face each other in a knockout-style cup to determine the national champion and qualification for the [[Copa Libertadores]], although the this decision was made after the beginning of the championship, without Club of 13 agreement. With strong performances from [[Zico (footballer)|Zico]], [[José Carlos da Costa Araújo|Zé Carlos]], [[Renato Portaluppi|Renato Gaúcho]] and [[Bebeto]], Flamengo conquered the Copa União with major victories over [[Sport Club Internacional|Internacional]] and [[Clube Atlético Mineiro|Atlético Mineiro]]. However, there was a dispute over whether Flamengo and Internacional of the Green Module would dispute the quadrangular against [[Sport Club do Recife|Sport Recife]] and [[Guarani FC|Guarani]] of the Yellow Module. The Club of 13 clubs had agreed to not participate in the final set up by the CBF, since it was decided while the matches were already being played, but [[Eurico Miranda]], a representative of [[CR Vasco da Gama|Vasco]], Flamengo's archi-rival and member of the Club of 13, had already signed an agreement with CBF regarding the final, without the board consent. Flamengo still did not participate in the final under the understanding that it would only determine the entrants of the Copa Libertadores and not the Brazilian national champion.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=0qX8s2k1IRwC&dat=19870904&printsec=frontpage |title=Jornal do Brasil - Google News Archive Search |publisher=Google News |access-date=March 14, 2019}}</ref> CBF officially recognized Sport as the sole champion in 1987 and they qualified to the Copa Libertadores.

Throughout his career at Flamengo, Zico scored 508 goals and was the top scorer in club history before retiring in 1990.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.flaestatistica.com/jogadores.html |title=Players records |publisher=Flaestatística |access-date=July 26, 2016}}</ref>

Even without its biggest star, the early years of the post-Zico era were successful for Flamengo. They achieved national victory in the second edition of the [[Copa do Brasil]] in [[1990 Copa do Brasil|1990]], defeating [[Goiás Esporte Clube|Goiás]] in the finals. In 1992, Flamengo won their [[1992 Campeonato Brasileiro Série A|fifth Campeonato Brasileiro]], defeating [[Botafogo de Futebol e Regatas|Botafogo]] across two legs in the final (3–0, 2–2). The team's key player was again [[Leovegildo Lins da Gama Júnior|Júnior]] at 38 years old.

=== Risk of relegation (1995–2005) ===
After the Brazilian League title in 1992, the club entered a major financial crisis and domestic and international achievements became less frequent. In 1995, the year of Flamengo's centenary, radio sports broadcaster [[Kléber Leite]] became chairman of the club and signed striker [[Romário]], the current [[FIFA World Player of the Year]], from [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/fsp/1995/1/10/esporte/20.html |title=Flamengo anuncia contratação de Romário |date=January 10, 1995 |publisher=Folha de São Paulo |access-date=January 10, 2017}}</ref> He joined [[Sávio]] and later [[Edmundo]] to become, as the supporters called, "the attack of dreams".<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/fsp/1995/8/27/esporte/15.html |title='Ataque dos sonhos' faz a estréia hoje no Flamengo |date=August 27, 1995 |publisher=Folha de São Paulo |access-date=January 10, 2017}}</ref> Even with Romário and other stars, Flamengo's centennial year did not yield major trophies.

However, in 1996, Flamengo went undefeated in the Campeonato Carioca, conquering both the [[Taça Guanabara]] and [[Taça Rio]] phases. [[Romário]] was the top scorer of the tournament. [[Sávio]] was the top scorer and best player in Flamengo's victorious [[1996 Copa de Oro]] campaign. The Copa de Oro was Flamengo's first international success since 1981, their third overall international title.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://fichadojogo.wordpress.com/1996/08/16/flamengo-campeao-da-copa-ouro-de-1996/ |title=Flamengo Campeão da Copa Ouro de 1996 |date=August 16, 1996 |publisher=Baú do Futebol |access-date=January 10, 2017}}</ref>

In 1999, [[Edmundo dos Santos Silva]] was elected club president, and brought with him a massive contract with sports marketing company [[International Sport and Leisure|ISL]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.diariodecuiaba.com.br/arquivo/181299/esportes2.htm |title=Flamengo e ISL assinam contrato |publisher=Diário de Cuiabá |access-date=January 10, 2017}}</ref> Despite poor campaigns in the Campeonato Brasileiro, Flamengo won the [[1999 Copa Mercosur]], the second-tier cup of South America, and continued to be successful at the regional level, winning the triple in state championships (1999-2000-2001) for the fourth time as well the [[2001 Copa dos Campeões]] inter-state title. In 2001 league play, Flamengo avoided relegation to the [[Campeonato Brasileiro Série B|Brazilian Série B]] by winning against [[Sociedade Esportiva Palmeiras|Palmeiras]] the final match of the tournament.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://globoesporte.globo.com/bau-do-esporte/videos/v/em-2001-flamengo-vence-o-palmeiras-em-juiz-de-fora-e-escapa-do-rebaixamento/1659155/ |title=Em 2001, Flamengo vence o Palmeiras em Juiz de Fora e escapa do rebaixamento |date=December 2, 2001 |publisher=globoesporte.com |access-date=January 10, 2017}}</ref> The club suffered a series of bad campaigns in the national league in the following years.

ISL went bankrupt in 2002 for reasons unrelated to their contract with Flamengo, and the club was left without its wealthy partner. In the same year, Edmundo Santos Silva was removed from his role as president in a controversial manner amidst accusation of impropriety.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://esportes.estadao.com.br/noticias/futebol,edmundo-escandalos-e-titulos-no-fla,20020709p68705 |title=Edmundo: escândalos e títulos no Fla - Esportes |website=Estadão |language=pt-BR |access-date=April 12, 2019}}</ref> Lacking the funds to make key signings, Flamengo failed to field competitive teams and narrowly avoided relegation in the 2002, 2004, and 2005 campaigns. 2005 was one of the worst seasons in Flamengo's history. The club only escaped relegation after the arrival of coach [[Joel Santana]], who directed the team to six wins and three draws in nine matches played under his command. Twice in this low period, in [[2003 Copa do Brasil|2003]] and [[2004 Copa do Brasil|2004]], the team reached the finals of the [[Copa do Brasil]], ultimately falling to [[Cruzeiro Esporte Clube|Cruzeiro]] and [[Esporte Clube Santo André|Santo André]].

=== End of the drought (2006–2018) ===
[[File:Adriano Leite Ribeiro.jpg|right|thumb|[[Adriano Leite Ribeiro|Adriano]] celebrating a goal for Flamengo. In 2009 he finished as joint top-scorer in Série A with 19 goals.]]
In 2006, Flamengo reached the final of the Copa do Brazil for a fifth time, yet managed to conquer the title against rivals Vasco da Gama. From 2007 to 2009 Flamengo completed their fifth and most recent ''tricampeonato'' in the Carioca state league, and became sole owners of the record for most Carioca titles with 31 ([[Fluminense FC|Fluminense]] had 30 at the time).

On March 9, 2007, Flamengo received a commemorative date on the [[Rio de Janeiro (state)]] official calendar. Governor Sérgio Cabral Filho declared November 17 (the day the club was founded) "Flamengo Day".

In the [[Campeonato Brasileiro Série A 2007|2007]] [[Campeonato Brasileiro Série A|Brazilian Série A]], Flamengo won many games at home, escaped the relegation zone and climbed to 2nd place before being defeated by [[Clube Náutico Capibaribe|Náutico]] 1–0 in the final round and ultimately ending the season 3rd. This marked a dramatic improvement in league outcome from previous seasons. Flamengo finished 5th the [[2008 Campeonato Brasileiro Série A|following year]], and in [[2009 Campeonato Brasileiro Série A|2009]] after finishing the first half of the Brazilian Série A in 10th place, Flamengo won the title. With this victory Flamengo became five-time Brazilian League champions 17 years after their last title in 1992.<ref name="netfla2">{{Cite web |url=http://www.netfla.com.br/titulos |title=Títulos |publisher=NetFla.com.br |language=pt |access-date=August 18, 2015}}</ref> The 2009 championship team finished the season with 67 points, the lowest winning point total in Brazil since the current league format was established in 2003. Flamengo were champions despite spending only two rounds at the top of the league: the final two. The title was won after a dramatic 2–1 come-from-behind victory against [[Grêmio Foot-Ball Porto Alegrense|Grêmio]] in the final round.
[[File:Ronaldinho Gaúcho.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ronaldinho]] celebrates scoring for Flamengo in February 2011.]]
International success continued to elude Flamengo through the 21st century. After finishing runners-up in the [[2001 Copa Mercosur]] to [[San Lorenzo de Almagro|San Lorenzo]] on [[Penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalties]], the club survived as far the quarter-finals only one time in their following twelve competitions (both [[Copa Libertadores]] and [[Copa Sudamericana]]). In [[2008 Copa Libertadores|2008]] in Flamengo's first official tournament tie against a club from [[Liga MX|Mexico]], they defeated [[Club América]] 4–2 in the [[Estadio Azteca]] before losing polemically 3–0 at home and being eliminated in the [[2008 Copa Libertadores knockout stages#América v Flamengo|Copa Libertadores round of 16]].

Flamengo experienced a poor run in Série A from 2010 to 2015, finishing better than 10th only once. Following the success of 2009, the club gambled on winning several titles and signed striker [[Vágner Love]] to form a pair with [[Adriano Leite Ribeiro|Adriano]]. The dream of repeating as state champions four times in a row was foiled by Botafogo in 2010. After narrowly qualifying out of the group stage in the [[2010 Copa Libertadores|Copa Libertadores]], manager [[Andrade (footballer, born 1957)|Andrade]] was still fired. In their first quarter-final appearance since 1993, Flamengo were eliminated by [[Club Universidad de Chile|Universidad de Chile]]. Shortly after, Vágner Love and Adriano left the team. A series of coaching changes during the troublesome domestic league saw Flamengo survive relegation and claim the final berth to the [[2011 Copa Sudamericana|Copa Sudamericana]] under manager [[Vanderlei Luxemburgo]].

The blockbuster signing of 2011 was 30-year-old superstar [[Ronaldinho]] from [[A.C. Milan]]. He was joined by Argentine [[Darío Bottinelli]] and [[Fluminense FC|Fluminense]] idol [[Thiago Neves]]. Flamengo won the Campeonato Carioca outright in an undefeated campaign, but captured no other trophies that season: eliminations in the [[2011 Copa do Brasil|Copa do Brasil]] by [[Ceará Sporting Club|Ceará]] and the [[2011 Copa Sudamericana|Sudamericana]] by Universidad de Chile, and a fourth-place finish in the [[2011 Campeonato Brasileiro Série A|league]] left fans feeling that a strong roster had been squandered. The season saw the retirement of Serbian club idol [[Dejan Petković]] as well. In 2012 Ronaldinho sued Flamengo claiming lack of payment for four months and canceled his contract with the club,<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.cbc.ca/sports/soccer/ronaldinho-leaving-flamengo-over-unpaid-salaries-1.1168247 |title=Ronaldinho leaving Flamengo over unpaid salaries |date=May 31, 2012 |publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation |access-date=April 12, 2019}}</ref> Thiago Neves returned to Fluminense after a drawn-out negotiation with contract-holders [[Al-Hilal FC|Al-Hilal]], and defender [[Alex Sandro da Silva|Alex Silva]] was loaned to [[Cruzeiro Esporte Clube|Cruzeiro]] after threatening Flamengo with a lawsuit. Vágner Love and [[Ibson]] returned for a 2012 campaign that yielded no trophies and a group-stage exit from the [[2012 Copa Libertadores|Libertadores]].

At the end of 2012, Flamengo elected Eduardo Bandeira de Mello as club president for three years. The goal of his term was to improve the club's finances, after an independent audit assessed Flamengo's debt at [[Brazilian real|R$]]750&nbsp;million.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://espn.com.br/noticia/322462_flamengo-admite-susto-com-a-divida-reconhece-longo-caminho-e-volta-a-recorrer-a-ajuda-de-torcedor |title=Flamengo admite susto com a dívida, reconhece longo caminho e volta a recorrer à ajuda de torcedor |publisher=ESPN |language=pt |access-date=April 12, 2019}}</ref> After a typical series of managerial changes, [[Jayme de Almeida]] was appointed as interim manager during which he fought off relegation and won the [[2013 Copa do Brasil|2013 Copa do Brasil final]] against [[Club Athletico Paranaense|Atlético Paranaense]]. It was Flamengo's third Copa title, after 1990 and 2006.

Flamengo's [[Copa do Brasil]] title-defense fell short to [[Clube Atlético Mineiro|Atlético Mineiro]] in the semi-final. However, by 2014, Flamengo was the only club that successfully reduced their debt over the year (down to [[Brazilian real|R$]]600&nbsp;million) and recorded the highest annual profit.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://espn.com.br/noticia/501393_flamengo-tem-o-maior-lucro-da-historia-do-futebol-brasileiro |title=Flamengo tem o maior lucro da história do futebol brasileiro |publisher=ESPN |language=pt |access-date=April 12, 2019}}</ref> In 2015 after an inconsistent start to the Carioca and national league seasons, multiple managers were dismissed and Flamengo failed to qualify for the Libertadores.

2017 was characterized as the year Flamengo played two major finals at the end of the season but failed to win either. After going undefeated in the [[2017 Campeonato Carioca]], they were eliminated in the [[2017 Copa Libertadores|Libertadores]] group stage, failing to win a single match away from home but qualifying for the [[2017 Copa Sudamericana|Copa Sudamericana]] in third place. In the [[2017 Copa do Brasil|Copa do Brasil]], the club reached the final where they lost in a penalty shootout to [[Cruzeiro Esporte Clube|Cruzeiro]]. Less than three months later, they reached an unprecedented [[2017 Copa Sudamericana Finals|Copa Sudamericana final]]. They lost away to [[Club Atlético Independiente|Independiente]] and drew at home 1–1, losing the title. After the match, a group of Flamengo supporters rioted outside the hotel where Independiente were staying. [[CONMEBOL]] punished the club with two closed-door home matches in the following Copa Libertadores.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://globoesporte.globo.com/futebol/times/flamengo/noticia/apos-confusao-no-hotel-do-independiente-conmebol-vai-abrir-processo-contra-o-fla.ghtml |title=Após confusão no hotel do Independiente, Conmebol abrirá processo contra o Fla |website=Globoesporte |language=pt-br |access-date=March 14, 2019}}</ref>

Nine years after their last Campeonato Brasileiro victory, Flamengo made a title run but fell just short. In [[2018 Campeonato Brasileiro Série A|2018]] they spent the most rounds as league leader (thirteen) and broke their points record from 2016 (72), but finished runners-up behind [[Sociedade Esportiva Palmeiras|Palmeiras]]. That season, the club recorded their two highest outgoing transfer fees in history: 18-year-old winger [[Vinícius Júnior]]<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://globoesporte.globo.com/futebol/times/flamengo/noticia/2017/01/lateral-esquerdo-jorge-e-vendido-ao-monaco-e-deixa-o-flamengo.html |title=Real Madrid sign 16-year-old Vinícius Júnior from Flamengo for £39.6m |date=June 2017 |publisher=The Guardian |access-date=December 4, 2017}}</ref> moved to [[Real Madrid CF|Real Madrid]] in July for €46&nbsp;million, and 20-year-old midfielder [[Lucas Paquetá]]<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://esporte.uol.com.br/futebol/ultimas-noticias/2018/10/10/dono-de-70-fla-vende-paqueta-ao-milan-ita-e-ficara-com-r-100-milhoes.htm |title=Dono de 70%, Fla vende Paquetá ao Milan-ITA e ficará com R$ 100 milhões |date=October 10, 2018 |publisher=UOL |access-date=January 11, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2813944-ac-milan-complete-lucas-paqueta-transfer-player-to-be-introduced-on-tuesday |title=AC Milan Complete Lucas Paqueta Transfer, Player to Be Introduced on Tuesday |date=January 4, 2019 |publisher=Bleacher Report |access-date=January 11, 2019}}</ref> transferred to [[A.C.

Flamengo's 2019 campaign under Jorge Jesus' leadership broke a number of records in the Campeonato Brasileiro's 20-team double round-robin era (2006–present): most points (90), most wins (28), most goals scored (86), best goal differential (+49), longest undefeated streak (24 matches), most points clear of runners-up (16) and most goals by a single player (25 from Gabriel Barbosa).<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://interativos.globoesporte.globo.com/futebol/times/flamengo/especial/ficou-marcado-na-historia |title=Ficou marcado na história {{!}} Flamengo |website=interativos.globoesporte.globo.com |language=pt-br |access-date=December 16, 2019}}</ref>

Flamengo participated in the [[FIFA Club World Cup]] for the first time in the club's history in [[2019 FIFA Club World Cup|2019]] in Qatar. The club defeated [[Al Hilal SFC]] 3–1 in the semi-final, but lost 0–1 to Liverpool in the [[2019 FIFA Club World Cup Final|final]].<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.fifa.com/clubworldcup/news/firmino-writes-liverpool-into-club-world-cup-history |title=Firmino writes Liverpool into Club World Cup history |date=December 22, 2019 |access-date=December 22, 2019 |publisher=Fédération Internationale de Football Association |website=FIFA.com}}</ref>

==Crest and uniforms==

=== Crest ===
Flamengo's crest has changed slightly throughout the club's history. Most of the changes has been changes to the interlocked letters monogram, with the latest redesign being unveiled in 2018.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.redesignfla.com/ |title=Redesign Flamengo |publisher=redesignfla.com |access-date=August 2, 2018}}</ref>

The club uses three crests in different situations: the full crest is used as the club's official logo, the rowing crest is used for all rowing related uniforms and equipment, and the white "CRF" monogram is typically the only component of the crest worn on the primary football uniform.

Beginning in 1980, Flamengo wore three white stars aligned vertically along the side of their monogram crest to indicate their three state league tri-championships (1942–43–44, 1953–54–55, and 1978–79–79 Special).<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://colunadoflamengo.com/2017/05/evolucao-manto-sagrado-flamengo/ |title=A evolução do Manto Sagrado do Flamengo |date=May 6, 2017 |website=Coluna do Fla - Notícias, colunas, contratações, jogos e mais |language=pt-BR |access-date=April 30, 2019}}</ref> When [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] became Flamengo's kit provider in 2000, their first kit featured the full shield crest with three stars above it for the first time. After the fourth state league tri-championship (1999-2000-2001) and to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the [[1981 Copa Libertadores]] and [[1981 Intercontinental Cup|Intercontinental Cup]] championships, a fourth white star and a gold star ware introduced above the crest. Sjnce 2005 the club uses only the gold star above the "CRF" monogram crest on their shirts.

=== Uniforms ===
{{Commons|Clube de Regatas do Flamengo kits}}
At the 1895 meeting which established the Flamengo rowing club, the club's official colors were decided as blue and gold to symbolized the sky of Rio de Janeiro and the riches of Brazil.<ref name=":02">{{Cite web |url=http://globoesporte.globo.com/futebol/times/flamengo/noticia/2015/11/do-azul-e-ouro-para-o-rubro-negro-troca-que-conquistou-o-mundo.html |title=Do azul e ouro para o rubro-negro: a troca que conquistou o mundo |last=Frigols |first=Matheus |website=globoesporte.com |language=pt-br |access-date=April 29, 2019}}</ref> The team adopted a uniform of thick blue and gold horizontal stripes. However Flamengo failed to win a single regatta in their first year and gained the nickname of "bronze club." The team colors were perceived as bad luck, and the colored fabric was expensive to import from England. One year after the club's establishment, the official colors were replaced with the current red and black.

In 1912, at the request of the Flamengo rowing team (who opposed the use of their same uniform by the newly established football team), the football players dressed in shirts divided into red and black quarters which became known as the ''papagaio de vintém'' uniform, named after a particular style of [[kite]]. However the shirt became synonymous with bad luck and was replaced in 1913 by a shirt with red and black horizontal stripes and thinner white bands. This uniform was nicknamed the ''cobra coral'' due to its similarity to the pattern of a [[coral snake]]. This was the uniform worn when Flamengo won their first [[Campeonato Carioca]] title in 1914. The white bands were removed from the shirt in 1916 as the pattern was very similar to the [[List of German flags#German Empire (1871–1918)|flag of Germany at the time]], who Brazil was allied against in [[World War I]]. The rowing team permitted the football team to use their same uniform, and Flamengo's traditional football uniform of a red and black striped shirt, white shorts and red-black socks was born.<ref name=":3">{{Cite web |url=https://mantosdofutebol.com.br/2013/10/historia-camisa-flamengo/ |title=História da camisa do Flamengo |date=October 28, 2013 |website=Mantos do Futebol |language=pt-BR |access-date=April 30, 2019}}</ref>

In 1938, Flamengo manager [[Izidor Kürschner|Dori Kruschner]] suggested the creation of a secondary white uniform to "improve the visibility in night matches." The new uniform was approved by the club, and Flamengo became a pioneer of secondary uniforms in Brazil. The white shirt had two red and black stripes across the chest until 1979 when it was changed to a plain white chest with stripes on the sleeves. This was the shirt worn by the team that won the [[1981 Intercontinental Cup]].<ref name=":3" />

Beginning in the 1990s the club began to experiment with their second and third alternative uniforms, sometimes wearing all black or all red shirts.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://globoesporte.globo.com/futebol/times/flamengo/noticia/estreia-com-derrota-do-uniforme-cor-cinza-revive-a-maldicao-das-terceiras-camisas-do-flamengo.ghtml |title=Estreia com derrota do uniforme cor cinza revive a "maldição das terceiras camisas" do Flamengo |website=Globoesporte |language=pt-br |access-date=August 6, 2019}}</ref> In 1995 for the club's [[centenary]], a "papagaio de vintém''"'' shirt was worn in friendlies.<ref name=":3" /> In 2010 uniform supplier [[Olympikus]] introduced a blue and gold alternative uniform which paid homage to Flamengo's original colors and regatta uniform, however it was not well received by fans who likened it to the uniform worn by the fictional satirical team "Tabajara" on the popular comedy program [[Casseta & Planeta|Casseta & Planeta Urgente]].<ref name=":02" /><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://colunadoflamengo.com/2017/07/de-volta-as-origens-entenda-por-que-o-fla-lancara-uniforme-azul-e-dourado/ |title=De volta às origens: Entenda por que o Fla lançará uniforme azul e dourado |date=July 19, 2017 |website=Coluna do Fla - Notícias, colunas, contratações, jogos e mais |language=pt-BR |access-date=April 29, 2019}}</ref> In the first half of the [[2009 Clube de Regatas do Flamengo season|2009 season]], the team wore a uniform without sponsorship for the first time in 25 years.<ref name=":3" /> Flamengo have continued to traditionally wear red and black striped shirts with white shorts as their primary uniform.<center>

==Stadiums==

=== Rua Paysandu ===
Flamengo's first official home ground was the '''Estádio da Rua Paysandu''' ("Paysandu Street Stadium"). The ground formerly belonged to [[Paissandu Atlético Clube]] before they ceased playing football in 1914. The owners of the ground rented the field to Flamengo where they played their home matches from 1915 to 1932.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.lance.com.br/flamengo/reduto-nacao-lembre-estadios-que-tratou-como-casa.html |title=Reduto da Nação! Lembre estádios que já foram a casa do Flamengo |website=Lance! |language=pt-BR |access-date=March 15, 2019}}</ref> Between 1912 and 1915 (and later between 1932 and 1938), the club played all their matches on the grounds of [[Botafogo de Futebol e Regatas|Botafogo]] or [[Fluminense FC|Fluminense]]. The first Flamengo match at Rua Paysandu was played on October 31, 1915 in the Campeonato Carioca against [[Bangu Atlético Clube|Bangu]]. Crowds of 15,000 watched Flamengo face Fluminese at the park in 1918 and 1919.

=== Estádio da Gávea ===

:{{Main|Estádio da Gávea}}
[[File:Gávea HPIM0892.JPG|right|thumb|Estádio da Gávea]]
Flamengo's home stadium is nominally the '''Estádio da Gávea''' (officially named the '''Estádio José Bastos Padilha''' at Flamengo's Gávea Headquarters), which was inaugurated on September 4, 1938, and has a capacity of 4,000 people. The stadium is named after José Bastos Padilha, Flamengo's president at the time of the stadium's construction, from 1933 to 1937. Even though Flamengo no longer play their matches at Gávea, the site serves as the club's administrative headquarters. Since the 1990s, the stadium has been used almost exclusively for the club's youth and women's teams' matches, and as the training ground for the senior team. Most matches are played at the significantly larger [[Estádio do Maracanã|Maracanã Stadium]], considered by supporters as the real Flamengo home ground.<ref>[http://www.flamengo.com.br/flapedia/Est%C3%A1dio_da_g%C3%A1vea Estádio da Gávea] (in Portuguese). ''Flapédia''.</ref> Gávea Stadium is not actually located in the neighborhood of [[Gávea]] but rather in [[Leblon]].

During the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]], the [[Netherlands national football team|Dutch National Team]] used the [[Estádio da Gávea]] and all of its facilities as their training ground in preparation for the competition.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.foxnews.com/sports/2014/06/07/orange-crush-netherlands-and-flamengo-fans-rub-shoulders-as-dutch-open-training.html |title=Orange crush: Netherlands and Flamengo fans rub shoulders as Dutch open training to public |date=June 7, 2014 |publisher=Fox News Channel |access-date=August 24, 2016}}</ref>

=== Maracanã ===
{{Main|Estádio do Maracanã}}
[[File:Maracanã stadium.jpg|right|thumb|Inside view of Maracanã]]
Since its construction for the [[1950 FIFA World Cup|1950 World Cup]], the '''Maracanã''' has primarily served as the home ground for the four biggest Rio de Janeiro clubs. The stadium was officially completed in 1965, 17 years after construction began. In 1963, more than 194,000 people attended a match between Flamengo and Fluminense at the Maracanã. The capacity of the stadium allowed Flamengo to have the largest support of any clubs in Brazil for much of the 20th century.<ref>[http://www.flamengo.com.br/flapedia/Campeonato_Brasileiro_2008 Campeonato Brasileiro 2008] @Flapédia {{in lang|pt}}</ref><ref>[http://www.flamengo.com.br/flapedia/Jogos_do_Flamengo_em_2008 Jogos do Flamengo em 2008] @Flapédia {{in lang|pt}}</ref> In 1989 [[Zico (footballer)|Zico]] scored his final goal in the historic stadium, setting the current unbroken record for goals in the Maracanã at 333. An upper stand in the stadium collapsed on July 19, 1992, in the second match of the finals of [[1992 Campeonato Brasileiro Série A]] between [[Botafogo de Futebol e Regatas|Botafogo]] and Flamengo, leading to the death of three spectators and injuring 50 others.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.emergency-management.net/sport_ev.htm |title=Sports Disasters |access-date=March 23, 2007}}</ref> Following the disaster, the stadium's capacity was greatly reduced as it was converted to an all-seater stadium in the late 1990s. Following its 50th anniversary in 2000, the stadium underwent renovations which would increase its full capacity to around 103,000. After years of planning and nine months of closure between 2005 and 2006 (during which Flamengo played their home matches at [[Volta Redonda Futebol Clube|Volta Redonda's]] [[Estádio Raulino de Oliveira]] and [[Associação Atlética Portuguesa (RJ)|Portuguesa's]] [[Estádio Luso Brasileiro]]), the stadium was reopened in January 2007 with an all-seated capacity of 87,000. For the 2014 World Cup and 2016 Olympics and Paralympics, a major reconstruction project was initiated in 2010. The original seating bowl, with a two-tier configuration, was demolished, giving way to a new one-tier seating bowl.<ref name="stadiumguide.com">[http://www.stadiumguide.com/maracana/]</ref>

The stadium is officially under the management of Brazilian conglomerate [[Odebrecht]] as of 2013.<ref>[http://m.folha.uol.com.br/esporte/2017/04/1873008-grupo-frances-acerta-compra-da-gestao-do-maracana.shtml?mobile# Grupo francês acerta compra da gestão do Maracanã]</ref> This has resulted in unfavorable rental agreements for Flamengo who do not officially administer the stadium and often owe rental fees for matches in excess of their ticket revenue, even for matches with high attendance.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://globoesporte.globo.com/futebol/times/flamengo/noticia/flamengo-acumula-prejuizos-mesmo-com-casa-cheia-e-negocia-solucoes-para-viabilizar-maracana.ghtml |title=Flamengo acumula prejuízos mesmo com casa cheia e negocia soluções para viabilizar Maracanã |website=Globoesporte |language=pt-br |access-date=March 15, 2019}}</ref> The most recent rental agreement was signed in 2018 and is valid through 2020. In April 2019, Flamengo and Fluminense came to an agreement with the state and the operators of the Maracanã to serve as joint-managers of the venue for the following six months, a deal which allowed the clubs to pay a fixed monthly fee and receive a higher share of matchday revenue than was granted under the previous deal.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://globoesporte.globo.com/rj/futebol/noticia/flamengo-e-fluminense-vao-administrar-o-maracana-pelos-proximos-seis-meses.ghtml |title=Flamengo e Fluminense são os escolhidos pelo Governo do Rio para administrar o Maracanã |website=Globoesporte |language=pt-br |access-date=April 28, 2019}}</ref>

==Rivalries==
[[File:Festejando el gol Flamengo.jpg|right|thumb|Supporters celebrating a goal]]

===Rivalry with Vasco da Gama===
{{Main|Clássico dos Milhões}}
The ''Clássico dos Milhões'' (English: "Derby of Millions") is the traditional Brazilian derby between Flamengo and [[CR Vasco da Gama|Vasco da Gama]], both from [[Rio de Janeiro]]. It is considered one of the biggest rivalries in Brazilian football and in football worldwide. The derby's name originated in the 1920s and refers to the two largest fanbases in the state of [[Rio de Janeiro (state)|Rio de Janeiro]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.rsssf.com/rssbest/vascofla.html |title=The Vasco-Flamengo Rivalry |date=July 17, 2001 |publisher=WorldSoccer |access-date=September 1, 2016}}</ref> Both clubs were established in the late 19th century as [[Rowing (sport)|regatta rowing]] clubs. The first football match between the clubs was played in 1923 when Vasco entered the top division of the [[Campeonato Carioca|Carioca state league]]. From the 1972 to 2001, the matchup was elevated as the most important of Flamengo's rivalries (surpassing [[Fluminense FC|Fluminense]]) and became one of the biggest rivalries in all of Brazil. In this span, Flamengo and Vasco played in or won the final of each of the phases of the state championship nearly every year, frequently facing one another. This also coincided with the beginnings of the national [[Campeonato Brasileiro Série A|Campeonato Brasileiro]] and the growth in popularity of both clubs nationwide. The most iconic matches between Flamengo and Vasco featured the idols of both clubs challenging each other: [[Zico (footballer)|Zico]] of Flamengo (1971–83; 85–89) and [[Roberto Dinamite]] of Vasco da Gama (1971–79; 80–93).

===Rivalry with Fluminense===
{{Main|Fla–Flu}}
The rivalry between these two clubs began in October 1911 when a group of dissatisfied players from [[Fluminense FC|Fluminense]] left their club and joined Flamengo, establishing the football department at their new club. The first ''Fla–Flu'' ever was played the following year on July 7. Fluminense won the match 3–2, with 800 people in attendance.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.worldsoccer.com/columnists/tim-vickery-columnists/tim-vickerys-notes-from-south-america-brief-history-of-the-flamengo-fluminense-derby-369381 |title=Tim Vickery's Notes from South America: brief history of the Flamengo-Fluminense derby |date=March 21, 2016 |publisher=WorldSoccer |access-date=September 1, 2016}}</ref> Flamengo and Fluminense are the two most successful team in the Campeonato Carioca: as of 2019 Flamengo have 35 state league titles and Fluminense have 31. In 1963, the [[Maracanã Stadium|Maracanã]] held 194,603 spectators to watch the ''Fla-Flu'' match.

=== Rivalry with Botafogo ===
The first confrontation between Rio de Janeiro rivals Flamengo and [[Botafogo de Futebol e Regatas|Botafogo]] occurred in 1913. The match became known as the ''Clássico da Rivaldade'' (English: "Rivalry Classic") in the 1960s. Flamengo's mascot of the [[vulture]] originated during the June 1, 1969 match against Botafogo when Flamengo supporters released a vulture onto the field in response to the racist cheers of ''urubu'' (vulture) from the Botafogo supporters.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://globoesporte.globo.com/Esportes/Noticias/Memoria/0,,MUL971128-16319,00-URUBU+FAZ+ANOS+COMO+SIMBOLO+DO+FLA.html |title=Globoesporte.com > Memória - NOTÍCIAS - Urubu faz 40 anos como símbolo do Fla |website=globoesporte.globo.com |access-date=March 14, 2019}}</ref> Flamengo's top scorer in the derby is [[Zico (footballer)|Zico]] and Botafogo's top scorer is [[Heleno de Freitas]].

=== Rivalry with Palmeiras ===
[[Sociedade Esportiva Palmeiras|Palmeiras]] and Flamengo have been the most financially powerful teams in Brazil for some time and since 2016, Brazil's biggest interstate ([[Rio de Janeiro]] x [[São Paulo]]) rivalry. Nowadays, no club in Brazil is able to keep up with the pair in hiring and wages. In the last years, both are stable at the top of the Brazilian league [[Campeonato Brasileiro Série A|Série A]]. The rivalry started in finance and went on to performance and on a daily basis, is inflamed by supporters on both sides.

===Rivalry with Atlético Mineiro===
{{Main|Flamengo–Atlético Mineiro football rivalry}}
Flamengo has an inter-state rivalry with [[Clube Atlético Mineiro|Atlético Mineiro]] of [[Minas Gerais]], developed in the 1980s from numerous controversial encounters between the two clubs in that decade's Campeonato Brasileiro and Copa Libertadores editions. It maintained its high intensity through the following years, and is considered one of the biggest interstate rivalries in Brazilian football.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://espn.uol.com.br/video/448720_mauro-rivais-na-copa-do-brasil-flamengo-e-atletico-mg-vao-reviver-grandes-classicos-da-decada-de-80 |title=Atlético e Flamengo revivem clássico dos anos 80 |date=November 18, 2014 |publisher=[[ESPN]] |access-date=November 18, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://trivela.uol.com.br/como-os-timacos-de-fla-e-galo-criaram-maior-rivalidade-interestadual-brasil/ |title=Como os timaços de Fla e Galo criaram a maior rivalidade interestadual do Brasil |last=Leandro |first=Stein |date=October 29, 2014 |website=Trivela |language=pt |trans-title=How Fla's and Galo's superteams created the biggest interstate rivalry in Brazil |access-date=October 11, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://flapedia.com.br/Clube_Atl%C3%A9tico_Mineiro |title=Clube Atlético Mineiro – Flapédia |date=September 29, 2015 |publisher=Flapédia |language=pt |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117022212/http://flapedia.com.br/Clube_Atl%C3%A9tico_Mineiro |archive-date=November 17, 2015 |access-date=October 23, 2015}}</ref>

==Supporters==
[[File:Taça Guanabara de 2008 (Final - Flamengo 2-1 Botafogo.jpg|thumb|right|Flamengo supporters at Maracanã stadium.]]
Since the early 1990s, surveys have shown that Flamengo is consistently the most supported club in Brazil with an estimated more than 40 million fans.  In a 2019 survey, 20 percent of adult football fans in Brazil consider themselves supporters of Flamengo, with high levels of support in all states of the country,  including the [[North Region, Brazil|North]] and [[Northeast Region, Brazil|Northeast regions]], in addition to Rio de Janeiro. Flamengo supporters are known as ''Nação Rubro-Negra'' (en: ''Scarlet-Black Nation'').

The first organized supporters group in all of Brazil, Charanga Rubro-Negra (''Scarlet-Black Charanga Band''), was founded in support of Flamengo in 1942.<ref name="organizadasbrasil.com" /> Since then, a large number of additional organized supporters groups have formed around Flamengo, notably Torcida Jovem-Fla (''Young-Fla''), Urubuzada (''Vultures''), Flamanguaça (''FlaBooze''), and Raça Rubro-Negra (''Scarlet-Black Race'').

In 2007 Flamengo supporters were declared as part of the cultural heritage of the city of Rio de Janeiro, along with [[bossa nova]] and Bola Preta, the oldest [[Carnival block]] in Rio.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.diariodorio.com/torcida-do-flamengo-patrimnio-cultural-da-cidade-do-rio-de-janeiro/ |title=Torcida do Flamengo é Patrimônio Cultural da Cidade do Rio de Janeiro &#124; Diário do Rio de Janeiro |publisher=Diariodorio.com |access-date=January 24, 2014}}</ref>

In the [[1983 Campeonato Brasileiro Série A]] final, Flamengo played against [[Santos FC|Santos]] in the [[Maracanã Stadium|Maracanã]] in front of an official crowd of 155,523 with some estimates of over 160,000 people in attendance. 

The largest attendance for a football match in the world's history was the derby between Flamengo and Fluminense in 1963, with 194,603 spectators. Flamengo matches in the Maracanã have broken the 150,000 attendance mark thirteen times.

In July of 2020, their YouTube channel ''FLATV'' passed [[Liverpool FC]] as the club with the third most subscriptions for a soccer channel only behind [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] and [[Real Madrid]]. Flamengo's channel reached over 5 million subscriptions.

=== Women's basketball ===
The Flamengo [[women's basketball]] team won back-to-back Brazilian championships in 1954 and 1955. Ten years later with some of the same players, the program won back-to-back Brazilian titles again in 1964 and 1965. Flamengo players Norminha, Angelina, Marlene and Delei were champions of the [[1967 Pan American Games]] in [[Winnipeg]] with the [[Brazil women's national basketball team]].

In 1966 Flamengo won the Inter-club Basketball World Championship. The team was led by Angelina, considered one of the best players of her time.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.flaestatistica.com/basquete.html |title=Fla-Estatística.com - Esportes Oímpicos - Basquete |website=flaestatistica.com |access-date=March 15, 2019}}</ref>

=== Rowing ===
[[File:1896 - Flamengo.jpg|thumb|right|One of the firsts [[rowing (sport)|rowing]] teams of the club, in 1896.]]
The "Flamengo Regatta Group", later renamed the "Flamengo Regatta Club", was established in 1895 as Flamengo's first ever organized athletic department, forming the basis of the club's history and identity to this day. The first [[regatta]] victory came in 1898 in the Nautical Championship of Brazil, and the first title was won in 1900, the Regatta of the IV Centenary of the Discovery of Brazil, for which the club was awarded the Jug Tropon trophy. In 1905 the club won a classic event, the South American Cup. By 1908, Flamengo had already won 43 gold, 126 silver and 141 bronze medals. The success of the rowing club made the team famous even before the founding of the football department in 1911. Great rowers such as Everardo Paes de Lima, Arnaldo Voigt, Alfredo Correia ("Boca Larga"), Ângelo Gammaro ("Angelú") and Antônio Rebello Junior ("Engole Garfo") came through Flamengo, the latter three being considered Brazilian sports heroes for completing the Rio-Santos crossing in 1932.

From 1931 to 1937 Flamengo were seven-time champions of Rio de Janeiro, and were four-time repeat state champions from 1940 to 1943. In 1963 the "Buck era" began, which revolutionized Flamengo rowing. The coach brought in athletes from other states and renovated the club's facilities to better accommodate the boats. Buck was coach of the Brazilian National Team, directing the team in several international competitions. In the early 1980s, Flamengo won the state championship and won again in 1992. The club has won the men's Brazil Trophy 10 times, and the female once, in addition to 45 Carioca state titles.

=== Water polo ===
[[Water polo]] is the second oldest sport practiced by the club, after rowing. The team played their first game on May 27, 1913 in Rio de Janeiro, and defeated Clube Internacional de Regatas, 3–2. Flamengo only opened its water sports facility in 1965. Prior to that, athletes played and trained in the [[Rodrigo de Freitas Lagoon]] or in the sea. Flamengo's first polo championship in Rio de Janeiro came in 1985 and was the start of a run of nine consecutive championships through 1993. In 1985 the club won the South American Club Championship and the Brazil Trophy (also won four consecutive times). A female water polo team was established in 1987, winning the Brazil Trophy in 1987 and 1991 and the state championship in 1995.

=== American football ===
The club launched their [[American football]] team in 2013, forming a partnership with the Rio de Janeiro Emperors. The Emperors were established in 2008 and had previously partnered with [[Fluminense FC|Fluminense]] from 2010 to 2013. The team officially goes by the name of the Flamengo Emperors and compete in the BFA (''Brasil Futebol Americano'').<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://luluzinhaclub.com/2017/06/13/luluzinha-entrevista-felipe-castro-presidente-do-flamengo-imperadores/ |title=LULUZINHA ENTREVISTA FELIPE CASTRO, PRESIDENTE DO FLAMENGO IMPERADORES |date=June 13, 2017 |website=NFL Luluzinha Club |language=pt-BR |access-date=March 15, 2019}}</ref>

=== Tennis ===
Flamengo began playing [[tennis]] championships in 1916 and became three-time Rio champions soon after (1916–18), even with their athletes training at other clubs. Until 1932 the club practiced tennis on their football field at the Rua Paysandu. In 1963 the club inaugurated their own facilities and courts. The biggest idol of Flamengo's tennis department is [[Thomaz Koch|Thomas Koch]].

=== E-sports ===
{{main|Flamengo eSports}}
In 2017 the club announced they would be entering the increasingly popular [[Esports|e-sports]] leagues the following year, beginning with a [[League of Legends]] department and eventually establishing a [[Pro Evolution Soccer|PES]] team. Because the competitive League of Legends center of Brazil is at the [[Riot Games]] studio in [[São Paulo]], Flamengo established a permanent "gaming office" for the team in the city.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://sportv.globo.com/site/games/noticia/2017/07/fla-no-e-sport-quais-os-desafios-do-clube-ao-entrar-neste-novo-cenario.html |title=Fla no e-sport: quais os desafios do clube ao entrar neste novo cenário |website=sportv.com |language=pt-br |access-date=March 15, 2019 |last3=RJ}}</ref> Flamengo announced that they would not be partnering with an existing team but rather would have their own team.
