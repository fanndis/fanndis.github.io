'''Wall Street Reform''' or '''Financial Reform''' refers to reform of the financial industry and the [[Bank regulation in the United States|regulation]] of the financial industry in the [[United States]]. [[Wall Street]] is the home of the country's two largest [[stock exchange]]s, and "Wall Street" is a [[metonym]] for the American financial sector. Major Wall Street reform bills include the [[Federal Reserve Act]] of 1913, the [[Glass-Steagall Act]] of 1933, the [[Truth in Lending Act]] of 1968, the [[Community Reinvestment Act]] of 1977, the [[Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act]] of 1999, and the [[Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002]]. The most recent Wall Street reform bill, the [[Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act]], was signed by [[President of the United States]] [[Barack Obama]] on July 22, 2010, following a [[Financial crisis of 2007–08|global financial crisis]].

== The Glass-Steagall Act of 1933 ==
The [[Glass-Steagall Act]] of 1933 placed a "wall of separation" between banks and brokerages, which was largely repealed by the [[Financial Services Modernization Act]] of 1999.  The bill was enacted during the [[Great Depression]], which began with the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]].  The [[Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act]] of 1999 repealed the "wall of separation," allowing companies to simultaneously act as [[commercial bank]]s, [[investment bank]]s, and [[insurance company|insurance companies]].  Though some commentators regard the restoration of the 1933 bill as crucial, even calling it "the most vital element of Wall Street reform",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.counterpunch.org/martens03262010.html|title=The Most Vital Ingredient in Wall Street Reform Goes Missing|author=Pam Martens|date=2010-03-26|publisher=CounterPunch}}</ref> House Democratic leaders refused to allow an amendment by Rep.

== Dodd-Frank (2010)==
{{Main|Obama financial regulatory reform plan of 2009}}

As of May 2010, both the House and Senate bills had been passed, but the differences between the bills were to be worked out in [[United States congressional conference committee]]. Differences which must be resolved include:<ref>Indiviglio D. (2010).

''The Atlantic''.</ref>  whether the new consumer protection agency would be independent (Senate) or part of the [[Federal Reserve]];  whether to require banks to issue [[credit derivative]]s in separately capitalized [[subsidiary|affiliate]]s (Senate); how exactly the [[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation]] (FDIC) will wind down or bail out large institutions which fail; the circumstances under which large institutions could be broken up; a 15 to 1 leverage limit in the House bill; the terms of a Fed audit (continuous as in the House bill or one-time as in the Senate bill); both bills include the Volcker rule which prohibits [[proprietary trading]] by bank holding companies, but both have a caveat which allow for regulators to overrule the rule; both bills propose to regulate [[credit rating agencies]], but the Senate's bill is much stronger.

=== House bill ===
H.R. 4173, the [[Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act]] of 2009 by Rep. [[Barney Frank]] ([[Democratic Party of the United States|D]]-[[Massachusetts|MA]]), passed by the House of Representatives in December 2009,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c111:H.R.4173:|title=[Text of H.R. 4173 (3 versions)]|publisher=thomas.loc.gov}}</ref> and awaiting action by the Senate as of April 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.opencongress.org/bill/111-h4173/show|title=H.R.4173 - Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2009|publisher=OpenCongress.org|accessdate=2010-04-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/12/18/barney-frank-vs-the-credi_n_397404.html|title=Barney Frank Vs.

=== Volcker Rule ===
{{Further|Volcker Rule}}
The "Volcker Rule" was proposed by President [[Barack Obama]] based on advice by [[Paul Volcker]], and a draft of the proposed legislation was prepared by the [[U.S. Treasury Department]].  It limited any one bank from holding more than 10% of FDIC-insured deposits, and prohibited any bank with a division holding such deposits from using its own capital to make speculative investments.  The Volcker rule faced heavy resistance in the Senate and was introduced as part of the subsequent Dodd bill only in a limited form.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703503804575083823511212204|title='Volcker Rule' Stalls in Senate|publisher=Wall Street Journal|author=Damian Palmetta|date=2010-02-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE6224B920100303|title=Obama reasserts Volcker rule|author1=Kevin Drawbaugh  |author2=Karey Wutkowski |name-list-style=amp |date=2010-03-03|publisher=Reuters}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE62E5IZ20100315|title=Factbox: Key elements of Dodd's financial reform bill|publisher=Reuters|date=2010-03-15}}</ref>

=== Financial Stability Oversight Council ===

Chaired by the [[United States Secretary of the Treasury]], a new multi-authority oversight body called the Financial Stability Oversight Council of regulators will be established. The council will consist of nine members including regulators from the [[Federal Reserve System]], [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]], [[Federal Housing Finance Agency]], and many other agencies.  The main purpose of the council is to identify risk in the [[Financial system]]. Also, the council will look at the interconnectivity of the highly leveraged financial firms and can ask companies to divest holdings if their structure poses a great threat to the Financial system. The council will have a solid control on the operations of the leveraged firms and also help in increasing the transparency.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-07-15/congressional-overhaul-maps-the-future-of-financial-regulation.html|title='Congressional Overhaul Maps the Future of Financial Regulation'|publisher=Bloomberg Businessweek|author1=David Scheer |author2=Gregory Mott |author3=Lawrence Roberts |date=2010-07-15}}</ref>

== Wall Street Reform Plan (2016) for a new 21st Century Glass-Steagall Act ==

In 2016, 170 Economists, Financial Experts, and Academics Back Bernie Sanders' Wall Street Reform Plan. In the letter supporting Bernie Sander's Financial Reform Plan <ref>[https://berniesanders.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Wall-St-Letter-1.pdf], Economists and Financial Experts in Favor of Sen. Sanders' Wall St. Reforms</ref>

''"In our view, Sen. Bernie Sanders' plan for comprehensive financial reform is critical for avoiding another "too-big-to-fail" financial crisis. The Senator is correct that the biggest banks must be broken up and that a new 21st Century Glass-Steagall Act, separating investment from commercial banking, must be enacted.
Wall Street's largest banks are now far bigger than they were before the crisis, and they still have every incentive to take excessive risks. No major Wall Street executive has been indicted for the fraudulent behavior that led up to the 2008 crash, and fines imposed on the banks have been only a fraction of the banks' potential gains. In addition, the banks and their lobbyists have succeeded in watering down the Dodd-Frank reform legislation, and the financial institutions that pose the greatest risk to our economy have still not devised sufficient "living wills" for winding down their operations in the event of another crisis.
Secretary Hillary Clinton's more modest proposals do not go far enough. They call for a bit more oversight and a few new charges on shadow banking activity, but they leave intact the titanic financial conglomerates that practice most shadow banking. As a result, her plan does not adequately reduce the serious risks our financial system poses to the American economy and to individual Americans. Given the size and political power of Wall Street, her proposals would only invite more dilution and finagle. The only way to contain Wall Street's excesses is with reforms sufficiently bold and public they can't be watered down. That's why we support Senator Sanders' plans for busting up the biggest banks and resurrecting a modernized version of Glass Steagall."''
