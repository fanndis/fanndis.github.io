The city has grown from a [[Stone Age]] settlement to Poland's second-most-important city.

After the [[invasion of Poland]] by Nazi Germany at the start of [[World War II]], the newly defined [[Distrikt Krakau]] (Kraków District) became the capital of Germany's [[General Government]].

==Etymology==
The name of Kraków is traditionally derived from [[Krakus]] (Krak, Grakch), the legendary founder of Kraków and a ruler of the tribe of [[Lechites|Lechitians]]. In Polish, {{lang|pl|Kraków}} is an archaic [[possessive case|possessive]] form of ''Krak'' and essentially means "Krak's (town)". The true origin of the name is highly disputed among historians, with many theories in existence and no unanimous consensus. The first recorded mention of Prince Krakus (then written as ''Grakch'') dates back to 1190, although the town existed as early as the 7th century, when it was inhabited by the tribe of [[Vistulans]].<ref name="History"/> It is possible that the name of the city is derived from the word "kruk", meaning crow or raven.<ref>https://www.krakow.pl/kultura/73601,artykul,krakowskie_abc.html#:~:text=Istnieje%20kilka%20koncepcji%20wyja%C5%9Bniaj%C4%85cych%20pochodzenie,od%20imienia%20legendarnego%20ksi%C4%99cia%20Kraka.</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.krakow.pl/kultura/73601,artykul,krakowskie_abc.html|title=Krakowskie ABC - Magiczny Kraków|website=www.krakow.pl}}</ref>

The city's full official name is {{lang|pl|Stołeczne Królewskie Miasto Kraków}},<ref name="bip.krakow-UCHWAŁA"/> which can be translated as "[[royal city|Royal Capital City]] of Kraków". In English, a person born or living in Kraków is a Cracovian ({{lang-pl|krakowianin}} or ''krakus''). While in the 1990s the English version of the name was often written Cracow, the most widespread modern English version is Krakow.<ref>[http://krakow.wyborcza.pl/krakow/1,44425,4824554.html?disableRedirects=true Cracow czy Krakow?

==History==
{{Main|History of Kraków|Timeline of Kraków}}
[[File:Krakow nagrobek Kazimierza W.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Tomb of [[Casimir III the Great]] at [[Wawel Cathedral]]. Kraków was the capital of Poland from 1038 to 1596]]

Kraków's [[prehistory|early history]] begins with evidence of a Stone Age settlement on the present site of the Wawel Hill.<ref name="Wawel Kraków"/> A legend attributes Kraków's founding to the mythical ruler [[Krakus]], who built it above a cave occupied by a [[dragon]], [[Smok Wawelski]]. The first written record of the city's name dates back to 965, when Kraków was described as a notable commercial centre controlled first by Moravia (876–879), but captured by a Bohemian duke [[Boleslaus I of Bohemia|Boleslaus I]] in 955.<ref name="krakow.pl-2"/> The first acclaimed ruler of Poland, [[Mieszko I of Poland|Mieszko I]], took Kraków from the Bohemians and incorporated it into the holdings of the [[Piast dynasty]] towards the end of his reign.

In 1038, Kraków became the seat of the Polish government.<ref name="History"/> By the end of the 10th century, the city was a leading centre of trade.<ref name="Van Dongen"/> Brick buildings were constructed, including the Royal [[Wawel Castle]] with St. Felix and Adaukt Rotunda, [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] churches such as [[Church of St. Adalbert, Kraków|St. Adalbert's]], [[Wawel Cathedral|a cathedral]], and [[St. Mary's Basilica, Kraków|a basilica]].<ref name="Rosik - Urbańczyk"/> The city was sacked and burned during the [[First Mongol invasion of Poland|Mongol invasion]] of 1241.<ref>J.J. Saunders, ''The History of the Mongol Conquests'', (University of Pennsylvania Press, 1971), 85.</ref> It was rebuilt practically identical,<ref name="Akt lokacyjny">Polska Agencja Prasowa.

A third attack in 1287 was repelled thanks in part to the [[St. Florian's Gate|new built fortifications]].<ref name="Kolodziejczyk"/> In 1335, King [[Casimir III of Poland]] (Kazimierz in Polish) declared the two western suburbs to be a new city named after him, [[Kazimierz]] (''Casimiria'' in Latin). The defensive walls were erected around the central section of Kazimierz in 1362, and a plot was set aside for the [[Augustinians|Augustinian]] order next to [[Skałka]].<ref name="Świszczowski"/>

[[File:Kościół św. Wojciecha.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Church of St. Adalbert, Kraków|Church of St. Adalbert]] is one of the oldest churches in the city dating from the 11th-century]]

The city rose to prominence in 1364, when Casimir III of Poland founded the [[Jagiellonian University|University of Kraków]],<ref name="The establishment of a university"/> the second oldest university in central Europe after the Charles University in Prague. King Casimir also began work on a campus for the Academy in Kazimierz, but he died in 1370 and the campus was never completed. The city continued to grow under the joint [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania|Lithuanian]]-Polish [[Jagiellon dynasty]]. As the capital of the [[Kingdom of Poland (1385–1569)|Kingdom of Poland]] and a member of the [[Hanseatic League]], the city attracted many craftsmen, businesses, and [[guild]]s as science and the arts began to flourish.<ref name="poloniahans"/> The royal chancery and the University ensured a first flourishing of Polish literary culture in the city.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Sobecki|first1=Sebastian|title=Cracow|journal=Europe: A Literary History, 1348–1418, ed.

===Kraków's "Golden Age"===
[[File:Nuremberg chronicles - CRACOVIA.png|thumb|right|Woodcut of Kraków from the [[Nuremberg Chronicle]], 1493]]
The 15th and 16th centuries were known as Poland's ''Złoty Wiek'' or [[Golden Age]].<ref name="NormanDavies"/> Many works of [[Renaissance in Poland|Polish Renaissance]] art and architecture were created,<ref name="Mikos"/><ref name="unescoancient"/> including ancient synagogues in Kraków's Jewish quarter located in the north-eastern part of Kazimierz, such as the [[Old Synagogue (Kraków)|Old Synagogue]].<ref name="infosyn"/> During the reign of [[Casimir IV Jagiellon|Casimir IV]], various artists came to work and live in Kraków, and [[Johann Haller]] established a [[printing press]] in the city<ref name="Haller"/> after [[Kasper Straube]] had printed the [[Almanach cracoviense ad annum 1474|Calendarium Cracoviense]], the first work printed in Poland, in 1473.<ref name="Norman Davies, God's Playground, vol.1, chapter 5"/><ref name="Wieslaw Wydra 88"/>

[[File:View of Kraków near the end of the 16th century.jpg|thumb|upright=1.65|left|View of Kraków (''Cracovia'') near the end of the 16th-century]]

In 1520, the most famous [[church bell]] in Poland, named ''[[Zygmunt (bell)|Zygmunt]]'' after [[Sigismund I the Old|Sigismund I of Poland]], was cast by Hans Behem.<ref name="dzwon"/> At that time, [[Hans Dürer]], a younger brother of artist and thinker [[Albrecht Dürer]], was Sigismund's [[court painter]].<ref name="HansDur"/> [[Hans von Kulmbach]] made [[altarpiece]]s for several churches.<ref name="Kulmbach"/> In 1553, the Kazimierz district council gave the Jewish [[Kehilla (modern)|Qahal]] a licence for the right to build their own interior walls across the western section of the already existing defensive walls. The walls were expanded again in 1608 due to the growth of the community and influx of Jews from Bohemia.<ref name="Kazimierz.com"/> In 1572, King [[Sigismund II Augustus|Sigismund II]], the last of the Jagiellons, died childless. The Polish throne passed to [[Henry III of France]] and then to other foreign-based rulers in rapid succession, causing a decline in the city's importance that was worsened by pillaging during the [[Polish–Swedish wars|Swedish invasion]] and by an outbreak of [[bubonic plague]] that left 20,000 of the city's residents dead. In 1596, [[Sigismund III Vasa|Sigismund III]] of the [[House of Vasa]] moved the administrative capital of the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] from Kraków to [[Warsaw]].<ref name="warsaw-capital-1596"/>

===19th century===

Already weakened during the 18th century, by the mid-1790s the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] had twice been [[partitions of Poland|partitioned]] by its neighbors: [[Russian Empire|Russia]], the [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg empire]]    and [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]].<ref name="The Polish struggle for freedom"/> In 1791, the Austrian and Holy Roman Emperor [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]] changed the status of Kazimierz as a separate city and made it into a district of Kraków. The richer Jewish families began to move out. However, because of the injunction against travel on the [[Shabbat|Sabbath]], most Jewish families stayed relatively close to the historic synagogues. In 1794, [[Tadeusz Kościuszko]] initiated an unsuccessful [[Kościuszko Uprising|insurrection]] in [[Main Square, Kraków|the town's Main Square]] which, in spite of his victorious [[Battle of Racławice]] against a numerically superior [[Imperial Russian Army|Russian army]], resulted in the [[third Partition of Poland|third and final partition of Poland]].<ref name="GR"/> In 1809, [[Napoleon|Napoleon Bonaparte]] captured former Polish territories from Austria and made the town part of the [[Duchy of Warsaw]]. Following Napoleon's defeat, the 1815 [[Congress of Vienna]] restored the pre-war boundaries but also created the partially independent [[Free City of Kraków]]. An [[Kraków Uprising|insurrection in 1846]] failed,<ref name="Frommer"/> resulting in the city being annexed by Austria under the name the [[Grand Duchy of Kraków]] ({{lang-pl|Wielkie Księstwo Krakowskie}}, {{lang-de|Großherzogtum Krakau}}).<ref name="Chambers's encyclopaedia: a... - Google Books"/>

In 1866, Austria granted a degree of autonomy to [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]] after its own defeat in the [[Austro-Prussian War]].<ref name="(''see: Franz Joseph I granted Kraków the municipal government'')"/> Politically freer Kraków became a Polish national symbol and a centre of culture and art, known frequently as the "Polish Athens" (''{{lang|pl|Polskie Ateny}}''). Many leading Polish artists of the period resided in Kraków,<ref name="google"/> among them the seminal painter [[Jan Matejko]],<ref name="Matejko"/> laid to rest at [[Rakowicki Cemetery]], and the founder of modern Polish drama, [[Stanisław Wyspiański]].<ref name="culture"/> [[Fin de siècle]] Kraków evolved into a modern metropolis; [[tap water|running water]] and electric [[tram|streetcars]] were introduced in 1901, and between 1910 and 1915, Kraków and its surrounding suburban communities were gradually combined into a single administrative unit called Greater Kraków (''{{lang|pl|Wielki Kraków}}'').<ref name="Becoming Metropolitan: Urban Selfhood and the Making of Modern Krakow"/><ref name="Kalendarium"/>

At the outbreak of [[World War I]] on 3 August 1914, [[Józef Piłsudski]] formed a small [[cadre (military)|cadre]] [[military organization|military unit]], the [[First Cadre Company]]—the predecessor of the [[Polish Legions in World War I|Polish Legions]]—which set out from Kraków to fight for the liberation of Poland.<ref name="Urb 171-172"/> The city was briefly besieged by Russian troops in November 1914.<ref name="twierdza"/> Austrian rule in Kraków ended in 1918 when the [[Polish Liquidation Committee]] assumed power.<ref name="Eastern Europe: an introduction to... - Google Books"/><ref name="Encyclopedia of Rusyn history and... - Google Books"/>

With the emergence of the [[Second Polish Republic]], Kraków resumed its role as a major academic and cultural centre, with the establishment of new universities such as the [[AGH University of Science and Technology]] and the [[Jan Matejko Academy of Fine Arts]], including a number of new and essential vocational schools. It became an important cultural centre for the [[History of the Jews in Poland|Polish Jews]], including both [[Zionism|Zionist]] and [[General Jewish Labour Bund in Poland|Bundist]] groups.<ref>{{cite web |title=Kraków after 1795 |url=http://www.yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/Krakow/Krakow_after_1795 |publisher=YIVO |accessdate=13 November 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181113161327/http://www.yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/Krakow/Krakow_after_1795|archive-date=13 November 2018}}</ref><ref name="Krakow old scenes, including historical photographs"/> Kraków was also an influential centre of Jewish spiritual life, with all its manifestations of religious observance from [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]], to [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]] and [[Reform Judaism]] flourishing side by side.

Following the invasion of Poland by Nazi Germany in September 1939, the city of Kraków became part of the [[General Government]], a separate administrative region of the [[Nazi Germany|Third Reich]]. On 26 October 1939, the Nazi Regime constructed [[Distrikt Krakau]], one of four total districts within the General Government. On the same day, the city of Kraków also became the capital of the administration. The General Government was ruled by [[Hans Frank]] who was based in the city's [[Wawel Castle]]. The Nazis envisioned turning Kraków into a completely Germanised city; after removal of all the Jews and Poles, renaming of locations and streets into the German language, and sponsorship of propaganda trying to portray it as a historically German city.<ref>[http://www.tygodnik.com.pl/dodatek-ks/04/sabor.html Cztery miasta w jednym – nowa historia wojennego Krakowa Niechciana "stolica" ] Agnieszka Sabor Tygodnik Powszechny Nr 4 (2794), 26 stycznia 2003</ref> On 28 November 1939 Hans Frank created ''[[Judenrat|Judenräte]]'' (Jewish Councils) which were to be run by Jewish citizens for the purpose of carrying out orders for the Nazis. These orders included registration of all Jewish people living in the area, the collection of taxes, and forced labour groups.

On the eve of the war some 56,000 Jews resided in Krakow, almost one-quarter of a total population of about 250,000. By November 1939, the Jewish population of Krakow had grown to approximately 70,000.<ref name=USHMM-Holocaust-Encyclopedia-Krakow/><ref name=USHMM-Ghettos-Encyclopedia-VolII/> According to German statistics from 1940, over 200,000 Jews lived within the entire [[Kraków District]], exceeding 5 percent of the total population in the district. These statistics, however, are likely an underestimate.<ref name=USHMM-Ghettos-Encyclopedia-VolII/>

During an operation called "{{lang|de|[[Sonderaktion Krakau]]}}", more than 180 university professors and academics were arrested and sent to [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp|Sachsenhausen]] and [[Dachau concentration camp|Dachau]] [[nazi concentration camps|concentration camps]], though the survivors were later released on the request of prominent Italians.<ref name="16B.

Before the formation of ghettos, which began in the District in December 1939, Jews  were encouraged to flee the city. For those who remained the German authorities decided in March 1941 to allocate a then suburban neighborhood, [[Podgórze|Podgórze District]], to become Kraków's  ghetto where so many Jews were destined to die of illness or starvation. Initially, most ghettos were open and Jews were allowed to enter and exit freely.  However, with time ghettos were generally closed and security became tighter. From autumn 1941, the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] developed the policy of [[Extermination through labour]],{{sfn|Longerich|2010| p=171}} which further worsened the already bleak Jewish condition.The ghetto inhabitants were later murdered or sent to German  [[Extermination camp]]s, including [[Belzec extermination camp|Bełżec]] and [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]], and to [[Kraków-Płaszów concentration camp]].<ref name="The-Kraków_Ghetto_1940-1943"/> The largest deportations within the District occurred from June to September 1942. More specifically, the Kraków ghetto deportation occurred in the first week of June 1942,<ref name=USHMM-Ghettos-Encyclopedia-VolII/> and in March 1943 the ghetto was definitely liquidated.{{sfn|Longerich|2010| p=376}}

[[Roman Polanski]], the film director, is a survivor of the Kraków Ghetto, while [[Oskar Schindler]] selected employees from the ghetto to work in his [[Oskar Schindler's Enamel Factory|enamelware factory]], ''{{lang|de|Deutsche Emailwaren Fabrik}}'' (''{{lang|de|Emalia}}'' for short) saving them from the camps.<ref name="All for Love - Google Books"/><ref name="Oskar Schindler: The Untold Account... - Google Books"/> Similarly, many men capable of physical labor were saved from the deportations to extermination camps and instead set to labor camps across the General Government.<ref name=USHMM-Ghettos-Encyclopedia-VolII/>
By September 1943, the last of the Jews from the Kraków ghetto were deported. Although [[World War II looting of Poland|looted by occupational authorities]], Kraków remained relatively undamaged at the end of World War II,<ref name="LukZaw"/> sparing most of the city's historical and architectural legacy.

Kraków lies in the southern part of Poland, on the [[Vistula River]], in a valley at the foot of the [[Carpathian Mountains]], {{convert|219|m|ft|abbr=on}} [[above mean sea level|above sea level]]; halfway between the [[Polish Jura Chain|Jurassic Rock Upland]] ({{lang-pl|Jura Krakowsko-Częstochowska}}) to the north, and the [[Tatra Mountains]] {{convert|100|km|mi|abbr=on}} to the south, constituting the natural border with [[Slovakia]] and the [[Czech Republic]]; {{convert|230|km|0|abbr=on}} west from the border with [[Ukraine]].

There are five [[nature reserve]]s in Kraków, with a combined area of ca. {{convert|48.6|ha|acre|abbr=off}}. Due to their ecological value, these areas are legally protected. The western part of the city, along its northern and north-western side, borders an area of international significance known as the Jurassic [[Bielany, Kraków|Bielany]]-[[Tyniec]] refuge. The main motives for the protection of this area include plant and animal wildlife and the area's [[geomorphology|geomorphological]] features and landscape.<ref name="Pattern of karst landscape of the Cracow Upland (South Poland)"/> Another part of the city is located within the ecological 'corridor' of the Vistula River valley. This corridor is also assessed as being of international significance as part of the Pan-European ecological network.<ref name="The forms of nature protection within the city limits"/> The city centre is situated on the left (northern) bank of the river.

Being towards [[Eastern Europe]] and a relatively considerable distance from the sea, Krakow has significant temperature differences according to the progress of different [[air mass]]es, having four defined seasons of the year. Average temperatures in summer range from {{convert|18.6|to|20.4|C|F|0}} and in winter from {{convert|-0.6|to|0.8|C|F|0}}. The average annual temperature is {{convert|10.0|C|F|0}}.

During very cold nights the temperature can drop to {{convert|-15|C|F|0}}. The city lies near the [[Tatra Mountains]], there are often occurrences of [[halny]] blowing (a [[foehn wind]]), causing temperatures to rise rapidly, and even in winter reach up to {{convert|20|C|F|0}}.{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}}

In relation to [[Warsaw]], temperatures are very similar for most of the year, except that in the colder months [[Regions of Poland|southern Poland]] has a larger daily temperature range, more moderate winds, generally more rainy days and with greater chances of clear skies on average, especially in winter. The lower sun angle also allows for a larger [[growing season]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://weatherspark.com/compare/y/85104~87583/Comparison-of-the-Average-Weather-in-Krak%C3%B3w-and-Warsaw|title=The Typical Weather Anywhere on Earth - Weather Spark|website=weatherspark.com|access-date=2019-03-10}}</ref> In addition, for older data there was less sun than the capital of the country, about 30 minutes daily per year, but both have small differences in relative humidity and the direction of the winds is northeast.<ref name=":0" />

[[File:Barbakan Krakow z ulicy Basztowej.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Kraków Barbican]] dating from around 1498 was once a fortified outpost of the inner medieval city]]

Developed over many centuries, Kraków provides a showcase setting for many historic styles of architecture. As the city expanded, so too did the architectural achievements of its builders. It is for this reason that the variations in style and urban planning are so easily recognisable.{{according to whom|date=June 2020}}

Built from its earliest nucleus outward, and having escaped much of the destruction endured by Poland during the 20th-century wars, Kraków's many architectural monuments can typically be seen in historical order by walking from the city centre out, towards its later districts. Kraków is one of the few medieval towns in Poland that does not have a historic [[Ratusz]] [[town hall]] in its [[Main Market Square, Kraków|Main Square]], because it has not survived the [[Partitions of Poland]].{{cn|date=June 2020}}

Kraków's historic centre, which includes [[Kraków Old Town|the Old Town]], [[Kazimierz]] and the [[Wawel Castle]], was included as the first of its kind on the list of UNESCO [[World Heritage Site]]s in 1978.<ref name="Centre"/> The ''Stare Miasto'' is the most prominent example of an old town in the country.<ref name="Gustafson"/> For many centuries Kraków was [[List of Polish monarchs|the royal]] capital of Poland, until [[Sigismund III Vasa]] relocated the court to [[Warsaw]] in 1596. The whole district is bisected by [[Royal Road, Kraków|the Royal Road]], the coronation route traversed by the [[List of Polish monarchs|Kings of Poland]]. The Route begins at [[St. Florian's Church]] outside the northern flank of the old city-walls in the [[Middle Ages|medieval]] suburb of Kleparz; passes the [[Kraków barbican|Barbican of Kraków]] (''Barbakan'') built in 1499, and enters ''Stare Miasto'' through the [[Florian Gate]]. It leads down Floriańska Street through the Main Square, and up Grodzka to [[Wawel]], the former seat of Polish royalty, overlooking the [[Vistula River|Vistula river]]. Old Town attracts visitors from all over the World. Kraków historic centre is one of the 13 places in Poland that are included in the UNESCO [[World Heritage Site]]s. The architectural design of the district had survived all cataclysms of the past and retained its original form coming from the medieval times. The Old Town of Kraków is home to about six thousand historic sites and more than two million works of art.<ref name="architecture72"/> Its rich variety of heritage architecture includes Romanesque (e.g., [[St. Andrew's Church, Kraków]]), [[Culture of medieval Poland|Gothic]], [[Renaissance in Poland|Renaissance]] and [[Baroque in Poland|Baroque]] buildings. Kraków's palaces, churches, theatres and mansions display great variety of color, architectural details, [[stained glass]], paintings, sculptures, and furnishings.{{cn|date=June 2020}}

[[File:Krakow Kanonicza 20070804 1000.jpg|left|thumb|Kanonicza Street, at the foot of the [[Wawel Castle]]]]

In addition to the old town, the city's district of [[Kazimierz]] is particularly notable for its many renaissance buildings and picturesque streets, as well as the historic Jewish quarter located in the north-eastern part of Kazimierz. Kazimierz was founded in the 14th century to the south-east of the city centre and soon became a wealthy, well-populated area where construction of imposing properties became commonplace. Perhaps the most important feature of medieval Kazimierz was the only major, permanent bridge (''Pons Regalis'') across the northern arm of the Vistula. This natural barrier used to separate Kazimierz from the Old Town for several centuries, while the bridge connected Kraków to the [[Wieliczka Salt Mine]] and the lucrative Hungarian trade route. The last structure at this location (at the end of modern Stradom Street) was dismantled in 1880 when the northern arm of the river was filled in with earth and rock, and subsequently built over.<ref name="Świszczowski"/><ref name="wandaluzja-1"/>

[[File:Kraków 239a.jpg|thumb|upright=2|View of Kraków from St. Mary's Basilica in the Market Square]]

By the 1930s, Kraków had 120 officially [[Synagogues of Kraków|registered synagogues]] and prayer houses that spanned across the old city. Much of Jewish intellectual life had moved to new centres like [[Podgórze]].<ref name="krakow.jewish.org.pl-pdf"/> This in turn, led to the redevelopment and renovation of much of Kazimierz and the development of new districts in Kraków. Most historic buildings in central Kazimierz today are preserved in their original form. Some old buildings, however, were not repaired after the devastation brought by the Second World War, and have remained empty. Most recent efforts at restoring the historic neighborhoods gained new impetus around 1993. Kazimierz is now a well-visited area, seeing a booming growth in Jewish-themed restaurants, bars, bookstores and souvenir shops.

[[File:DZolopa 033 2013.jpg|left|thumb|[[Kraków Society of Friends of Fine Arts|Palace of Art]] at Szczepański Square, is an example of [[Art Nouveau]] architecture in central Kraków<ref name="Palace of Art"/>]]

As the city of Kraków began to expand further under the rule of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]], the new architectural styles also developed. Key buildings from the 19th and early 20th centuries in Kraków include the Jan Matejko Academy of Fine Arts, the directorate of the Polish State Railways as well as the original complex of [[Kraków Główny railway station]] and the city's [[Cracow University of Economics|Academy of Economics]]. It was also at around that time that Kraków's first radial boulevards began to appear, with the city undergoing a large-scale program aimed at transforming the ancient Polish capital into a sophisticated regional centre of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. New representative government buildings and multi-story tenement houses were built at around that time. Much of the urban-planning beyond the walls of the Old Town was done by Polish architects and engineers trained in [[Vienna]]. Some major projects of the era include the development of the [[Jagiellonian University]]'s new premises and the building of the [[Collegium Novum]] just west of the Old Town. The imperial style planning of the city's further development continued until the return of Poland's independence, following the First World War. Early modernist style in Kraków is represented by such masterpieces as [[Kraków Society of Friends of Fine Arts|the Palace of Art]] by [[Franciszek Mączyński]] and the 'House under the Globe'. [[Vienna Secession#Architecture|Secession style]] architecture, which had arrived in Kraków from [[Vienna]], became popular towards the end of [[Partitions of Poland|the Partitions]].<ref name="Strasz"/>

[[File:Basztowa Ur.Woj i NBP, Krakow.jpg|upright|thumb|''Basztowa Street'', filled with some of the most unique historical buildings in all architectural styles; part of the [[Royal Road, Kraków|Royal Route of Kraków]]]]
With Poland's regained independence came the major change in the fortunes of Kraków—now the second most important city of a sovereign nation. The state began to make new plans for the city development and commissioned a number of representative buildings. The predominant style for new projects was modernism with various interpretations of the art-deco style.<ref name="Vogt-Nassery"/> Important buildings constructed in the style of [[Polish modernism]] include the Feniks 'LOT' building on Basztowa Street, the Feniks department store on the [[Main Market Square, Kraków|Main Square]] and the Municipal Savings Bank on Szczepański Square. The Józef Piłsudski house is also of note as a particularly good example of interwar architecture in the city.<ref name="Kraków, Oleandry – Dom im. Józefa Piłsudskiego"/>

After the Second World War, new government turned toward Soviet influence and the [[Stalinist architecture|Stalinist monumentalism]]. The doctrine of [[Socialist realism in Poland]], as in other countries of the [[People's Republic]]s, was enforced from 1949 to 1956. It involved all domains of art, but its most spectacular achievements were made in the field of urban design. The guidelines for this new trend were spelled-out in a 1949 resolution of the National Council of Party Architects. Architecture was to become a weapon in establishing the new social order by the communists.<ref name="inyourpocket/sightseeing">{{cite web|url=http://www.inyourpocket.com/poland/krakow/sightseeing/Nowa-Huta|title=Nowa Huta – Sightseeing in Kraków – In Your Pocket city guide – essential travel guides to cities in Poland|publisher=Inyourpocket.com|accessdate=11 December 2011}}</ref> The ideological impact of urban design was valued more than aesthetics. It aimed at expressing persistence and power. This form of architecture was implemented in the new industrial district of Nowa Huta with apartment blocks constructed according to a Stalinist blueprint, with repetitious courtyards and wide, tree-lined avenues.<ref name="Nh.pl-1"/>

[[File:Pawilon Wyspiański 2000, Kraków.JPG|left|thumb|Pawilon Wyspiański 2000 is a rare piece of [[Postmodern architecture]] present in Kraków's ''Old Town''<ref name="sztuka-architektury1"/>]]

Since the style of the [[Renaissance in Poland|Renaissance]] was generally regarded as the most revered in old Polish architecture, it was also used for augmenting Poland's [[Socialist realism in Poland|Socialist national]] format. However, in the course of incorporating the principles of Socialist realism, there were quite a few deviations introduced by the communists. One of these was to more closely reflect Soviet architecture, which resulted in the majority of works blending into one another. From 1953, critical opinions in the Party were increasingly frequent, and the doctrine was given up in 1956 marking the end of [[Stalinism in Poland|Stalinism]].<ref name="SOCREALIZM in Poland (1949–1955)"/> The [[socrealism|soc-realist]] centre of Nowa Huta is considered to be a meritorious monument of the times. This period in postwar architecture was followed by the mass-construction of large [[Plattenbau|Panel System]] apartment blocks, most of which were built outside the city centre and thus do not encroach upon the beauty of the old or new towns. Some examples of the new style (e.g., Hotel Cracovia) recently listed as heritage monuments were built during the latter half of the 20th century in Kraków.<ref name="naszemiasto-cracovia"/>

After the [[Revolutions of 1989]] and the birth of the [[Third Polish Republic|Third Republic]] in the latter half of the 20th century, a number of new architectural projects were completed, including the construction of large business parks and commercial facilities such as the [[Galeria Krakowska]], or infrastructure investments like the [[Tramways in Kraków#Kraków Fast Tram|Kraków Fast Tram]]. A good example of this would be the [[Manggha|Manggha Museum of Japanese Art and Technology]] designed by [[Arata Isozaki]], the 2007-built ''Pawilon Wyspiański 2000'',<ref name="sztuka-architektury1"/> which is used as a multi-purpose information and exhibition space, or the Małopolski Garden of Arts (''[[:pl:Małopolski Ogród Sztuki w Krakowie|Małopolski Ogród Sztuki]]''), a multi-purpose exhibition and theatre complex located in the historic Old Town.<ref>Małopolski Regionalny Program Operacyjny, [http://www.slowacki.krakow.pl/pl/aktualnosci/malopolski_ogrod_sztuki/ Budowa Małopolskiego Ogrodu Sztuki w Krakowie.] Teatr im.

[[File:Planty Garden, pavilion, Old Town, Krakow, Poland.JPG|thumb|right|A pavilion within the Planty Park during winter]]

There are about 40 parks in Kraków including dozens of gardens and forests.<ref name="wse.krakow"/> Several, like the [[Planty Park]], [[Botanical Garden in Kraków|Botanical Garden]], [[Kraków Zoo|Zoological Garden]], [[Park Krakowski]], [[Jordan Park]] and [[Błonia Park]] are located in the centre of the city; with Zakrzówek, Lasek Wolski forest, Strzelecki Park and Park Lotników (among others) in the surrounding districts.<ref name="wse.krakow"/> Parks cover about 318.5 hectares (787 acres, 1.2 sq mi) of the city.

The [[Planty Park]] is the best-known park in Kraków. It was established between 1822 and 1830 in place of the old city walls, forming a [[green belt]] around the Old Town. It consists of a chain of smaller gardens designed in various styles and adorned with monuments. The park has an area of {{convert|21|ha|acre}} and a length of {{convert|4|km|mi}}, forming a scenic walkway popular with Cracovians.<ref name="Strzala1"/>

The [[Jordan Park]] founded in 1889 by Dr [[Henryk Jordan]], was the first public park of its kind in Europe.<ref name="grodzka.net">[http://www.grodzka.net.pl/travel/jordan_park.php Henryk Jordan's Park.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930094731/http://www.grodzka.net.pl/travel/jordan_park.php |date=30 September 2007 }} ''Grodzka.net''.

All natural reserves of the Polish Jura Chain are part of the [[CORINE]] biotopes programme due to their unique flora, fauna, geomorphology and landscape. The western part of Kraków constitutes the so-called Obszar Krakowski ecological network, including the ecological corridor of the Vistula river. The southern slopes of limestone hills provide conditions for the development of [[Thermophile|thermophilous]] vegetation, grasslands and [[Shrubland|scrubs]].

The city is spaced along an extended latitudinal transect of the [[Vistula]] River Valley with a network of tributaries including its right tributary Wilga, and left: [[Rudawa (river)|Rudawa]], Białucha, [[Dłubnia]] and Sanka. The rivers and their valleys along with bodies of water are some of the most interesting natural wonders of Kraków.

===Districts===
{{Main|Districts of Kraków}}
Kraków is divided into 18 administrative districts (''[[dzielnica]]'') or boroughs, each with a degree of autonomy within its own municipal government.<ref name="districts"/> Prior to March 1991, the city had been divided into four quarters which still give a sense of identity to Kraków – the towns of [[Podgórze]], Nowa Huta, and [[Krowodrza]] which were amalgamated into the city of Kraków as it expanded, and the ancient town centre of Kraków itself.<ref name="districts"/>

[[File:PomnikGrunwaldzki-PlacMatejki-POL, Kraków.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Matejko Square featuring the [[Grunwald Monument]] at [[Kleparz]] is one of the city's most important public spaces]]

The oldest neighborhoods of Kraków were incorporated into the city before the late-18th century. They include the Old Town (''[[Kraków Old Town|Stare Miasto]]''), once contained within the [[Florian Gate|city defensive walls]] and now encircled by the Planty park; the [[Wawel]] District, which is the site of the Royal Castle and the cathedral; Stradom and [[Kazimierz]] with its historic Jewish quarter, the latter originally divided into Christian and Jewish quarters;<ref name="Krakow, Auschwitz and Warsaw"/> as well as the ancient town of [[Kleparz]].

Major districts added in the 19th and 20th centuries include [[Podgórze]], which until 1915, was a separate town on the southern bank of the Vistula, and Nowa Huta, east of the city centre, built after World War II.

[[File:Nowa Huta jako idealne socjalistyczne miasto.jpg|thumb|[[Socialist realism in Poland|Socialist-realist]] district of [[Nowa Huta]]]]

Among the most notable historic districts of the city are: [[Wawel Hill]], home to [[Wawel Castle]] and [[Wawel Cathedral]], where many historic Polish kings are buried; the medieval Old Town, with its [[Main Market Square, Kraków|Main Market Square]] ({{convert|200|m|ft}} square); dozens of old churches and museums; the 14th-century buildings of the Jagiellonian University; and Kazimierz, the historical centre of Kraków's Jewish social and religious life.<ref name="Krakow"/>

The Old Town district of Kraków is home to about 6,000 historic sites, and more than 2,000,000 works of art.<ref name="architecture72"/> Its rich variety of historic architecture includes [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]], [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] and [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] buildings. Kraków's palaces, churches and mansions display great variety of colour, architectural details, [[stained glass]], paintings, sculptures, and furnishings.

In the Market Square stands the Gothic [[St. Mary's Basilica, Kraków|St. Mary's Basilica]] (''Kościół Mariacki''). It was rebuilt in the 14th-century and features the famous wooden altar ([[Altarpiece of Veit Stoss]]), the largest Gothic altarpiece in the world,<ref name="Kurtz"/> carved by [[Veit Stoss]]. From the church's main tower a trumpet call (''[[hejnał mariacki]]''), is sounded every hour. The melody, which used to announce the opening and closing of city gates, ends unexpectedly in midstream. According to legend, the tune was played during the 13th-century [[Tatars|Tatar]] invasion by a guard warning citizens against the attack. He was shot by an archer of the invading Tatar forces whilst playing, the bugle call breaking off at the moment he died.<ref name="hejnal"/> The story was recounted in a book published in 1928 called ''[[The Trumpeter of Krakow]]'', by [[Eric P. Kelly]], which won a [[Newbery Award]].<ref name="JPKelly"/>

The metropolitan city of Kraków is known as the city of churches. The abundance of landmark, historic temples along with the plenitude of monasteries and convents earned the city a countrywide reputation as the "Northern Rome" in the past. The churches of Kraków comprise over 120 places of worship (2007) of which over 65 were built in the 20th century. More are still being added.<ref name="diecezja"/> In addition to [[Roman Catholicism]], other denominations present include [[Jehovah's Witnesses]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://apps.jw.org/ui/E/meeting-search.html#/weekly-meetings |title=Meetings :: Jehovah's Witnesses |work=jw.org }}</ref> [[Mariavite Church]], [[Polish Catholic Church]], [[Polish Orthodox Church]], [[Protestantism]] and [[Latter-Day Saints]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://churchofjesuschristtemples.org/statistics/unit/katowice-poland-district/|title=Katowice Poland District of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|work=ldschurchtemples.com}}</ref>

[[File:Saint Anne church 2019 01.jpg|thumb|[[Church of St. Anne, Kraków|Saint Anne's Church]] is the leading example of [[Baroque architecture]] in Poland]]
Kraków contains also an outstanding collection of monuments of Jewish [[sacred architecture]] unmatched anywhere in Poland. Kraków was an influential centre of Jewish spiritual life before the outbreak of World War II, with all its manifestations of religious observance from [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] to [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]] and [[Reform Judaism|Reform]] flourishing side by side. There were at least 90 synagogues in Kraków active before the [[Nazi German]] invasion of Poland, serving its burgeoning Jewish community of 60,000–80,000 (out of the city's total population of 237,000), established since the early 12th century.<ref name="Dylewski"/>

Most synagogues of Kraków were ruined during World War II by the [[Nazis]] who despoiled them of all ceremonial objects, and used them as storehouses for ammunition, firefighting equipment, as general storage facilities and stables. The post-[[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] Jewish population of the city had dwindled to about 5,900 before the end of the 1940s. Poland was the only [[Eastern Bloc]] country to allow free Jewish [[aliyah]] (emigration to [[Israel]]) without visas or exit permits upon the conclusion of World War II.<ref name=D-H>Devorah Hakohen, [https://books.google.com/books?id=hCw6v0TFhdMC&pg=PA70&dq=%22Poland+opened+its+gates+to+Jewish+emigration.%22&hl=en&ei=vZPlTILoE8uUnAey5NGjDQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22Poland%20opened%20its%20gates%20to%20Jewish%20emigration.%22&f=false ''Immigrants in Turmoil: Mass Immigration to Israel and Its Repercussions...''] Syracuse University Press, 2003 – 325 pages.
