==Background==
In 2009 few months after Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina came to power; the [[BDR Mutiny]] by border-security soldiers in [[Pilkhana, Bangladesh|Pilkhana]] in Dhaka led to 56 officers being killed. Some 800 [[Paramilitary]] personnel were charged for their involvement in the mutiny, and the crisis frayed ties between the civilian administration and elements of the military establishment. In 1975, mutinying soldiers had killed Hasina's father, Bangladesh's first Prime Minister — [[Sheikh Mujibur Rahman]].<ref name="Time">{{cite magazine|last=Tharoor|first=Ishaan|date=19 January 2012|title=Behind Bangladesh's Failed Coup Plot: A History of Violence|url=http://world.time.com/2012/01/19/behind-bangladeshs-failed-coup-plot-a-history-of-violence/?xid=rss-topstories |magazine=Time}}</ref>

The alleged conspiracy against the government comes more than a year after five military officers were sentenced to five years of imprisonment in a [[court-martial]] for their "involvement" in attempted murder of [[Fazle Noor Taposh]], the influential nephew of Sheikh Hasina, following the 2009 mutiny by [[Bangladesh Rifles]].<ref name="DeccanHerald"/>

==Coup==
The [[Bangladesh Army]] reported a failed [[coup d'état]] was supposed to take place on January 2012 by rogue military officers and [[expatriate]] but was stopped by the Bangladesh army on December 2011.<ref>{{cite news|last=Hossain|first=Farid|date=19 January 2012|title=Bangladesh military says it has foiled coup plot|url=http://archive.boston.com/news/world/asia/articles/2012/01/19/bangladesh_military_says_it_has_foiled_coup_plot/|newspaper=boston.com|agency=Associated Press}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Bangladesh army 'foils coup' against Sheikh Hasina|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-16627852|work=BBC News|date=19 January 2012|accessdate=21 January 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|first1=Sruthi|last1=Gottipati|first2=Hari|last2=Kumar|date=19 January 2012|title=Bangladesh Army Claims to Thwart Coup Attempt|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/20/world/asia/bangladesh-army-claims-to-thwart-coup-attempt.html?_r=2&scp=1&sq=coup%20attempt&st=cse&|newspaper=The New York Times}}</ref> Brigadier General Muhammad Mashud Razzaq, director of Personnel Services Directorate disclosed the plot at the [[Army Officers Club]] in [[Dhaka Cantonment]] on 19 January 2012. He also 14-16 mid ranking officers were involved, including [[Syed Mohammad Ziaul Haque]] alias Major Zia. Major Zia had called senior to midlevel army officers in different bases in the country to bring out soldiers under their command to establish [[Sharia law]]. His post on Facebook was published by the [[Amar Desh|Daily Amar desh]] which created coup-rumors in the army.<ref name="tyb">{{cite web|title=Army foils bid to topple govt|url=http://www.thedailystar.net/news-detail-219131|work=The Daily Star|accessdate=7 November 2016|date=20 January 2012}}</ref> Major Zia used a UK based roaming sim to contact fellow army officers.<ref name="asjl" /> A retired officer, Lieutenant Colonel [[Ehsan Yusuf]] was also involved in the plot.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Habib|first1=Haroon|title=Lessons from the coup that failed|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/lessons-from-the-coup-that-failed/article2829866.ece|work=The Hindu|type=Opinion|accessdate=7 November 2016|language=en-IN|date=25 January 2012}}</ref>

Military officials stated that the coup was instigated by hard-line Islamist military officers, while [[University of Dhaka]] political scientist Ataur Rahman and other analysts suggested it may have been caused by military unrest over a 2009 crackdown on the military.<ref>{{cite news|last=Magnier|first=Mark|date=19 January 2012|title=Bangladeshi army says it has foiled coup attempt|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/world_now/2012/01/bangladeshi-army-foiled-coup-attempt.html|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=21 January 2012}}</ref> Intelligence sources quoted by ''[[The Christian Science Monitor]]'' reported that the coup was an attempt to introduce [[sharia law]] by Islamist military officers with ties to [[Hizbut Tahrir]], an Islamist group that is outlawed in [[Bangladesh]]. The coup attempt had apparently been planned over several weeks or months with support of religious fanatics outside of Bangladesh.<ref>{{cite news|last=Ahmed|first=Anis|date=20 January 2012|title=Bangladesh Army says it foiled a coup via Facebook|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Latest-News-Wires/2012/0120/Bangladesh-Army-says-it-foiled-a-coup-via-Facebook|newspaper=The Christian Science Monitor|agency=Reuters|accessdate=22 January 2012}}</ref> Military sources said that up to 16 hard-line Islamist officers were involved in the coup, with some of them being detained.<ref>{{cite news|title=Bangladesh authorities vow to hunt coup plotters|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-16653581|work=BBC News|date=20 January 2012|accessdate=22 January 2012}}</ref> Lieutenant colonel Ehsan Yusuf was arrested on 15 December 2011 and Major Zakir Hossain 31 December 2011.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ishraq was to head 'new regime'|url=http://www.thedailystar.net/news-detail-221246|website=The Daily Star|accessdate=7 November 2016|date=5 February 2012}}</ref>

Brig. Gen. Muhammad Masud Razzaq, Director of the Personnel Services Directorate described the conspiracy involving a dozen active duty and retired officers that he said was intended "to spread disaffection in the Bangladeshi Army." The [[Brigadier]] said the plot was uncovered in December following the detention of mastermind [[Ghulam Azam]], former Ameer of the [[Jamaat-e-Islami Bangladesh]]. Azam, who opposed the independence of Bangladesh during and after the [[Bangladesh liberation war|1971 war]], is alleged to have led the [[Razakars (Bangladesh)|Razakar]] and [[Al-Badr]] formations that resisted the India-trained [[Mukti Bahini]]. A slew of arrests had taken place silently in Bangladesh through December, prompting [[Khaleda Zia]] the former Prime Minister to allege that army officers were becoming victims of "sudden disappearance".<ref>{{cite news|last=Chowdhury|first=Syed Tashfin|date=24 January 2012|title=Bangladesh warning after foiled coup|url=http://atimes.com/atimes/South_Asia/NA24Df02.html|newspaper=Asia Times|access-date=4 April 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160804073118/http://atimes.com/atimes/South_Asia/NA24Df02.html|archive-date=4 August 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>

==Aftermath==
On 28 December, a military court of inquiry was established to investigate the matter and punish those involved. Retired [[Major General]] Sayed Mohammad Ibrahim, a defense analyst, said the country and its democratic structures were reasonably immune to interference. "Today's news about events in the army is worrying but will not cause any damage to democracy," he said.<ref>{{cite news|first1=Ananya|last1=Sengupta|first2=Archis|last2=Mohan|date=20 January 2012|title=Coup bid by fanatics foiled: Bangla army  - Mastermind with anti-India history|url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1120120/jsp/frontpage/story_15029566.jsp|newspaper=The Telegraph|location=Calcutta, India}}</ref> The military spokesperson also said the initial investigations found non-resident Bangladeshis (NRB) link to the plot while at least one of the officers, the fugitive Major, was linked to banned Islamist group [[Hizbut Tahrir]]. He mentioned, "Stringent legal measures will be taken against the persons involved in the conspiracy after proper investigation." The army spokesman underlined that banking on the army in the past, "different evil forces availed political gains and made abortive attempts to do so but as an institution, military still has to bear the stigma".<ref name="DeccanHerald">{{cite news|title=Bangladesh army foils coup bid by rebels|url=http://www.deccanherald.com/content/220501/bangladesh-army-foils-coup-bid.html|newspaper=Deccan Herald|date=19 January 2012}}</ref> non-resident Bangladeshi, Ishraq Ahmed, who was involved in the coup said the coup goal was topple Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina from “letting Bangladesh be 'turned into a [[Bantustan]]' run by India”.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ishraq admits arrested men are his friends|url=http://www.thedailystar.net/news-detail-220224|work=The Daily Star|accessdate=7 November 2016|date=28 January 2012}}</ref> Major [[Syed Mohammad Ziaul Haque|Syed Mohammad Ziaul Haq]] and Ishraq Ahmed are on the run.<ref>{{cite web|title=Arrest Maj Ziaul, Ishraq|url=http://www.thedailystar.net/news-detail-249461|work=The Daily Star|accessdate=7 November 2016|date=12 September 2012}}</ref>
