The '''Central Park jogger case''' (events also referenced as the '''Central Park Five case''') was a criminal case in the [[United States]] over the aggravated [[assault]] and [[rape]] of a white woman jogging through the park (later publicly identified as Trisha Meili) during a series of reported attacks in [[Manhattan]]'s [[Central Park]] on April 19, 1989. Like the defendants in the case, three of the victims were Black or Latino.<ref name="nyTeditorial">{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/04/26/opinion/the-jogger-and-the-wolf-pack.html |title=The Jogger and the Wolf Pack|work=[[The New York Times]]|issn=0362-4331|date=April 26, 1989|access-date=June 23, 2019}}</ref>

Five youth defendants were falsely convicted of assaulting Meili, and [[Time served|served out their sentences]], before all were [[exonerate]]d, following the confession of another inmate, Matias Reyes, for the crime. The case became a topic of national interest, with evolving [[social issue]]s. Initially, the case led to public discourse about [[New York City]]'s perceived lawlessness, criminal behavior by youths, and violence toward women. It later became a high-profile example of [[racial profiling]], [[discrimination]], and [[Racial inequality in the United States|inequality]] in the media and legal system.<ref name=NYTimes1989>{{Cite news|last=Foderaro|first=Lisa W.|date=1989-05-01|title=Angered by Attack, Trump Urges Return Of the Death Penalty|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/05/01/nyregion/angered-by-attack-trump-urges-return-of-the-death-penalty.html|access-date=2020-07-12|issn=0362-4331}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Chancer|first=Lynn|s2cid=61900884|date=August 2005|title=Before and After the Central Park Jogger: When legal cases become social causes|journal=Contexts (American Sociological Association)|volume= 4| issue = 3|pages=38–42|doi=10.1525/ctx.2005.4.3.38}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|last=Pitt|first=David E.|date=1989-04-22|title=Jogger's Attackers Terrorized at Least 9 in 2 Hours|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/04/22/nyregion/jogger-s-attackers-terrorized-at-least-9-in-2-hours.html|access-date=2020-07-12|issn=0362-4331}}</ref><ref name=":1"/> All five defendants subsequently sued the City of New York for [[malicious prosecution]], [[racial discrimination]] and [[emotional distress]]; the City settled the suit in 2014 for $41 million.

[[File:Central Park May 2019 80.jpg|thumb|left|[[North Woods and North Meadow|North Woods]], one of several places where crimes were reported]]
At 9 p.m. on April 19, 1989, a group of an estimated 30–32 teenagers who lived in [[East Harlem]] entered [[Manhattan]]'s [[Central Park]] at an entrance in [[Harlem]], near Central Park North.<ref name="dwyer.flynn">{{cite web|last1=Dwyer|first1=Jim|last2=Flynn|first2=Kevin|url=http://www.ksg.harvard.edu/dnabook/NY-HOW%20CENT%20PK%20CASE%20COLLPSD.1st|title=New Light on Jogger's Rape Calls Evidence Into Question|work=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|date=December 1, 2002|access-date=March 3, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304051718/http://www.ksg.harvard.edu/dnabook/NY-HOW%20CENT%20PK%20CASE%20COLLPSD.1st|archive-date=March 4, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>    Some of the group committed several attacks, assaults, and robberies against people who were either walking, biking, or jogging in the northernmost part of the park and near the reservoir, and victims began to report the incidents to police.<ref name="Morgenthau"/>

Within the [[North Woods (Central Park)|North Woods]], between 105th and 102nd streets, they were reported as attacking several bicyclists, hurling rocks at a cab, and attacking a pedestrian, whom they robbed of his food and beer, and left unconscious.<ref name="dwyer.flynn"/><ref name="prenhall.com"/> The teenagers roamed south along the park's East Drive and the 97th Street transverse, between 9 and 10&nbsp;p.m.<ref name="dwyer.flynn"/> Police attempted to apprehend suspects after crimes began to be reported between 9 and 10 p.m.

At least some of the group traveled further south to the area around the reservoir, where four men jogging were attacked by several youths. Among the victims was John Loughlin, a 40-year-old schoolteacher, who was severely beaten and robbed between 9:40 and 9:50.<ref name="dwyer.flynn"/> He was hit in the head with a pipe and stick, knocking him briefly unconscious.<ref name="dwyer.flynn"/><ref name="prenhall.com"/><ref name="nymag.com"/> At a pre-trial hearing in October 1989, a police officer testified that when Loughlin was found, he was bleeding so badly that he "looked like he was dunked in a bucket of blood".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2002&dat=19891012&id=lLgiAAAAIBAJ&pg=2686,2825845|title=Three Men Assaulted on Evening of 'Wilding'|agency=Associated Press|date=October 12, 1989|work=Beaver County Times|access-date=June 15, 2019}}</ref>

It was not until 1:30&nbsp;a.m. that night that a female jogger was found in the North Woods area of the park. She had been pulled to the north some 300 feet off the path known as the 102nd Street Crossing; the path of her feet dragged through the grass was marked so clearly that it could be photographed. It was 18" wide. There was no evidence in the grass of footprints of multiple perpetrators. She was brutally beaten, suffering major blood loss and skull fractures; she was later revealed to have been raped.

After her discovery, the police increased the intensity of their effort to identify suspects in this attack and took more teenagers into custody. The jogger was not identified for about 24 hours, and it took days for the police to retrace her movements of that night. By the time of the trial of the first three suspects in June 1990, ''[[The New York Times]]'' characterized the attack on the jogger as "one of the most widely publicized crimes of the 1980s".<ref name="NYTimes.com2">{{cite web|last=Farber|first=M.

At a time of concern about crime in general in the city, which was suffering high rates of assaults, rapes, and homicides, these attacks provoked great outrage, particularly the brutal rape of the female jogger.

In most media accounts of the incident at that time, Meili was simply referred to as the "Central Park Jogger", but two local TV stations violated the media policy of not publicly identifying the victims of sex crimes and released her name in the days immediately following the attack.

==Other victims and chronology==
As identified by the Morgenthau report and ''The New York Times'' in a 2002 review of the case, these were:<ref name="dwyer.flynn"/><ref name="prenhall.com"/>
* Michael Vigna, a competitive bike rider hassled about 9:05&nbsp;p.m. by the group, one of whom tried to punch him.
* Antonio Diaz, a 52-year-old man walking in the park near 105th Street, was knocked to the ground by teenagers about 9:15&nbsp;p.m., who stole his bag of food and bottle of beer. He was left unconscious but soon found by a policeman.
* Gerald Malone and Patricia Dean, riding on a tandem bike, were attacked on East Drive south of 102nd Street about 9:15&nbsp;p.m. by boys who tried to stop them and grab Dean; the couple called police after reaching a call box.

The remaining victims were attacked by members of the large group while jogging near the reservoir:
* David Lewis, banker, attacked and robbed about 9:25–9:40
* Robert Garner, attacked about 9:30&nbsp;p.m.
* David Good, attacked about 9:47&nbsp;p.m.
* John Loughlin, the 40-year-old teacher, severely beaten and kicked about 9:40–9:50&nbsp;p.m. near the reservoir and left unconscious. He was also robbed of a [[Walkman]] and other items.

Three of the victims were black or Hispanic, like most of the suspects, complicating any narrative to attribute attacks solely to racial factors.<ref name="nyTeditorial"/>

== Arrests and investigation ==

=== Arrests of youths ===
The police were dispatched at 9:30&nbsp;pm and responded with scooters and unmarked cars. Through the night, they apprehended about 20 teenagers. They took custody of Raymond Santana, 14; and Kevin Richardson, 14; along with three other teenagers at approximately 10:15&nbsp;pm on [[Central Park West]] and 102nd Street.<ref name="dwyer.flynn"/><ref name="prenhall.com"/><ref name="nymag.com"/> Steven Lopez, 14, was arrested with this group within an hour of the several attacks that were first reported to police.<ref name="sullivan"/> He was also interrogated.<ref name="kunen"/>

The severely beaten Meili was not found until 1:30&nbsp;a.m. on April 20. Her discovery increased the urgency of police efforts to apprehend suspects. Antron McCray, 15; Yusef Salaam, 15; and [[Korey Wise]] (then known as Kharey Wise), 16, were brought in for questioning later that day (April 20), after having been identified by other youths in the large group as participants in or present at some of the attacks on other victims.<ref name="prenhall.com"/> Korey Wise said he had not been involved, and accompanied Salaam because they were friends.<ref name="nymag.com"/> These were the six suspects indicted for the attack on the female jogger (later identified as Meili).

They took into custody 14 or more other suspects over the next few days and arrested a total of ten suspects who were ultimately tried for the attacks. Among them were four [[African American]] and two [[Hispanic American]] teenagers who were indicted on May 10 on charges of assault, robbery, riot, rape, sexual abuse, and the attempted murders of Meili and an unrelated man, John Loughlin.

The police arrested additional suspects over 48 hours after the night of April 19 and interrogated numerous others. Among these was Clarence Thomas, 14, who was arrested on April 21, 1989, on charges related to the rape of the female jogger. After further investigation, he was never indicted, and all charges were dismissed against him on October 31, 1989.<ref name="prenhall.com"/> Also arrested in this period on charges of attacks against other persons in the park, and later indicted, was Jermaine Robinson, 15; Antonio Montalvo, 18; and Orlando Escobar, 16.<ref name="prenhall.com"/>

The five juveniles who later became known as the Central Park Five were interrogated for at least seven hours each before the detectives attempted to record their statements [https://centralpark5joggerattackers.com/videos/ as videotaped confessions].<ref name="dwyer.flynn"/> The videotaped confessions were not started until April 21. Santana, McCray, and Richardson made video statements in the presence of parents.<ref name="dwyer.flynn"/> Wise made several statements unaccompanied by any parent, guardian or counsel.<ref name="dwyer.flynn"/> Lopez was interviewed on videotape in the presence of his parents on April 21, 1989, beginning at 3:30&nbsp;a.m. He named others of the group by first names in the group attacks on other persons but denied any knowledge of the female jogger.<ref>[https://nyccpjstorage.blob.core.windows.net/original-investigation-and-prosecution/Audios%20and%20Videos/NYCLDVideo_004_Video%20Statement%20of%20Steven%20Lopez_4-21-1989.mp4]</ref> None of the six had defense attorneys during the interrogations or videotape process.

When taken into custody, Salaam told the police he was 16 years old and showed them identification to that effect. If a suspect had reached 16 years of age, his parents or guardians no longer had a right to accompany him during police questioning, or to refuse to permit him to answer any questions.<ref name="thedailybeast.com">{{cite news|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/10/19/decoding-the-crime-of-the-century-the-real-story-of-the-central-park-five.html|title=The Myth of the Central Park Five|newspaper=The Daily Beast|date=October 19, 2014|first=Edward |last=Conlon}}</ref> After Salaam's mother arrived at the station, she insisted that she wanted a lawyer for her son, and the police stopped the questioning.

The prosecutor planned to try the defendants in two groups and then scheduled the sixth defendant to be tried last. The latter pleaded guilty in January 1991 on lesser charges and received a reduced sentence.

Prosecution of the five remaining defendants—Kevin Richardson, Antron McCray, Raymond Santana, Korey Wise, and Yusef Salaam—in the rape and assault case was based primarily on confessions which they had made after lengthy police interrogations. None of the defendants had legal counsel during questioning. Many consider the interrogation techniques to have been coercive and they have been subject to wide criticism. Within weeks, they each withdrew their confessions, pleaded not guilty, and refused [[plea deal]]s on the rape and assault charges. None of the suspects' [[DNA profiling|DNA matched]] the [[DNA]] collected from the crime scene: two semen samples that both belonged to one unidentified man. No substantive physical evidence connected any of the five teenagers to the rape scene, but each was convicted in 1990 of related assault and other charges. Subsequently, known as the '''Central Park Five''', they received sentences ranging from 5 to 15 years. Four of the defendants appealed their convictions, but these were affirmed by appellate courts. The four juvenile defendants served 6–7 years each; the 16-year-old was tried and sentenced as an adult and served 13 years in an adult prison. The five other defendants, indicted for assaults of other victims, pleaded guilty to reduced charges and received less severe sentences.

===April 21 press conference and media coverage===
On April 21, senior police investigators held a press conference to announce having apprehended about 20 suspects in the attacks of a total of nine people in Central Park two nights before and began to offer their theory of the attack and rape of the female jogger. Her name was withheld as a victim of a sex crime. The police said up to 12 youths were believed to have attacked the jogger.<ref name="Pitt"/>

The main suspects were a sub-group{{citation needed|date=July 2020}} within the loose gang of 30 to 32 teenagers who had assaulted strangers in the park as part of an activity that the police said the teenagers referred to as "wilding". New York City senior detectives said the term was used by the suspects when describing their actions to police.<ref name="Pitt">{{cite news|title=Jogger's Attackers Terrorized at Least 9 in 2 Hours|last=Pitt|first=David E.|date=April 22, 1989|work=[[The New York Times]]|quote=The youths who raped and savagely beat a young investment banker as she jogged in Central Park Wednesday night were part of a loosely organized gang of 32 schoolboys whose random, motiveless assaults terrorized at least eight other people over nearly two hours, senior police investigators said yesterday. Chief of Detectives Robert Colangelo, who said the attacks appeared unrelated to money, [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], drugs or alcohol, said that some of the 20 youths brought in for questioning had told investigators that the crime spree was the product of a pastime called ''wilding.''}}</ref> The police described the attacks as "random" and "motiveless", saying they had "terrorized" people in the park. This account of the term "wilding" was soon disputed by investigative reporter [[Barry Michael Cooper]], who said that it originated in a police detective's misunderstanding of the suspects' use of the phrase "doing the wild thing", lyrics from rapper [[Tone Loc]]'s hit song "[[Wild Thing (Tone Lōc song)|Wild Thing]]".<ref name="Voice">Cooper, Barry Michael (May 9, 1989) "The Central Park Rape" in ''[[The Village Voice]]''.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/comment/comment-goldblatt121602.asp|title=Guest Comment: Certainties and Unlikelihoods: The Central Park Jogger, 2002|last=Goldblatt|first=Mark|date=December 16, 2002|work=[[National Review]]|access-date=August 21, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021222182357/http://www.nationalreview.com/comment/comment-goldblatt121602.asp|archive-date=December 22, 2002|url-status=dead|quote="...in their holding cells, the teens launched into a raucous rendition of Tone Loc's sexually charged [[hip-hop]] anthem, "Wild Thing."

Normal police procedures stipulated that the names of criminal suspects under the age of 16 were to be withheld from the media and the public. But this policy was ignored when the names of the arrested juveniles were released to the press before any of them had been formally [[arraignment|arraigned]] or [[indictment|indicted]].<ref name="Didion"/> For example, the name of Kharey Wise (he later adopted the use of Korey as his first name) was published in an April 25, 1989 article in the ''[[Philadelphia Daily News]]'' about the attack on the female jogger.<ref name="PhillyDN"/>

By that time, more information had been published about the primary suspects in the rape, who did not seem to satisfy typical profiles of perpetrators. Common factors had been ruled out. Reporters had found that some came from stable, financially secure families; police had ruled out drugs or major robbery, and most had no criminal records. On April 26, 1989, ''[[The New York Times]]'' published a cautionary editorial against the use of labels and questioning why such "well-adjusted youngsters" could have committed such a "savage" crime.<ref name="nyTeditorial"/>

After the major media's decisions to print the names, photos, and addresses of the juvenile suspects, they and their families received serious threats. Other residents living at the Schomburg Plaza, where four suspects lived, were also threatened. Because of this, editors of ''[[The City Sun]]'' and the ''[[Amsterdam News]]'' chose to use Meili's name in their continuing coverage of the events.<ref>{{cite book|title=Not Just Race, Not Just Gender: Black Feminist Readings|last=Smith|first=Valerie|publisher=Routledge|year=1998|isbn=0-415-90325-4|pages=16–17}}</ref>

Reverend [[Calvin O. Butts]] of the [[Abyssinian Baptist Church]] in [[Harlem]], who came to support the five suspects, said to ''The New York Times,'' "The first thing you do in the United States of America when a white woman is raped is round up a bunch of black youths, and I think that's what happened here."<ref name="Didion"/>

According to an FBI expert who gave evidence at the trial, all five defendants could be excluded as being the man who had left the semen samples inside Meili and on a sock.<ref name="Schanberg"/> In total, 14 men were tested, including the defendants and Meili's former boyfriend, and all were excluded.<ref name="Schanberg"/> The semen belonged to another, unidentified male.<ref name="Schanberg"/> Years later, more advanced DNA testing also revealed that the hairs in Richardson's clothes did not match the victim.<ref name="revisit"/>

==Sentencing and appeals==
After the guilty verdicts, the judge sentenced the defendants to the maximum for the charges and their ages. The four youths under 16 were sentenced to 5–10 years each. They had been held in a juvenile facility since their arrest. Wise at 16 was tried and sentenced as an adult because of the nature of the violent felony charges against him, under the Juvenile Offender Law of 1978.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}} He was sentenced to 5–15 years.

Four of the five youths appealed their convictions in the rape case the following year, but Santana did not appeal. Each of the convictions was upheld.<ref name="Morgenthau"/><ref name="prenhall.com"/>

The sentences each of them served is as follows:
* Yusef Salaam served 6 years and 8 months in juvenile detention from 1990 to 1996 and was released on parole
* Raymond Santana served 6 years and 8 months in juvenile detention from 1990 to 1996 and was released on parole. In 1998, he violated his parole and was sentenced to 3½–7 years' prison on drug charges. He was released and exonerated in 2002.
* Kevin Richardson served 7 years in juvenile detention from 1990 to 1997 and was released on parole.
* Antron McCray was sentenced to 5–10 years in juvenile detention. He served 6 years from 1990 to 1996 and was released on parole.
* Korey Wise was sentenced to 6–15 years in prison on sexual abuse, assault and riot. He served 13 years and 8 months in multiple state prisons: Rikers' Island Prison in 1990, Attica Correctional Facility in 1991, Wende State Penitentiary in 1993 and Auburn State Correctional Facility in 2001. In this prison, Wise met Matias Reyes, who was later found to have had actually assaulted and raped Meili. Reyes confessed and Wise was released in 2002.

On appeal, Salaam's attorneys charged that he had been held by police without access to parents or guardians. The majority appellate court decision upheld his conviction, noting that Salaam had initially lied to police about his age, claiming to be 16 and backing up his claim with a forged transit pass that, falsely, indicated that he was 16. This was the age at which a suspect could be questioned without a parent or guardian present. When Salaam informed police of his true age, they allowed his mother entry to the interrogation room.<ref name="APonCoercion">{{cite news|title=Detective Cites Coercion of Teen|date=July 24, 1990|agency=[[Associated Press]] |newspaper=[[Albany Times Union]]|page=B6|quote=Justice Thomas B.

===Biases affecting the convictions===

In a 2016 ''Guardian'' article, defense counsel William Warren was reported saying that he thought Trump's ads in 1989 had played a role in securing conviction by the juries, saying that "he poisoned the minds of many people who lived in New York City and who, rightfully, had a natural affinity for the victim."<ref name="GdnDemagogue"/> He noted, "Notwithstanding the jurors' assertions that they could be fair and impartial, some of them or their families, who naturally have influence, had to be affected by the inflammatory rhetoric in the ads."<ref name="GdnDemagogue"/> In 2019 ''Time'' magazine also assessed Trump's ads in 1989 as having adversely affected the case for the defendants.<ref name="Time53119">{{cite news |last1=Waxman |first1=Olivia B. |title=President Trump Played a Key Role in the Central Park Five Case.

In a 1991 ''[[New York Review of Books]]'' article, which was the first mainstream piece arguing that the Five's convictions had been wrongful, [[Joan Didion]] suggested the verdicts stemmed from a cultural crisis, writing that "So fixed were the emotions provoked by this case that the idea that there could have been, for even one juror, even a moment's doubt in the state's case… seemed, to many in the city, bewildering, almost unthinkable: the attack on the jogger had by then passed into narrative, and the narrative was...about what was wrong with the city and about its solution".<ref>[https://abcnews.go.com/ABC_Univision/News/film-voice-men-falsely-convicted-central-park-jogger/story?id=18037863 Cristina Costantini, "Film Gives Voice to Men Falsely Convicted in Central Park Jogger Case"], ABC News, December 21, 2012</ref>

==January 1991 plea bargain for Lopez==
Although Assistant District Attorney Elizabeth Lederer had said she would not accept a plea deal for any of the defendants indicted in the rape case, she did come to agreement with Steve Lopez and his attorney in the court on January 30, 1991, prior to a new jury being selected for his trial. He was considered the final of the six defendants in the jogger trial. Because Lopez had not acknowledged participating at all in the rape in his statement to police, and prosecution witnesses had withdrawn from testifying, based on what they said was fear of self-recrimination or "fear of their own safety", according to Lederer, the prosecution's case was extremely weak.<ref name="sullivan"/> Although some of the five defendants who had been convicted had accused Lopez in their statements of the most severe violence against the jogger, these could not be used against him because of their convictions.

After agreeing to the plea deal, Judge Galligan allowed Lopez to remain free on $25,000 bail until sentencing.<ref name="sullivan">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/01/31/nyregion/plea-bargain-is-accepted-for-final-jogger-case-defendant.html|last=Sullivan|first=Ronald|title=Plea Bargain Is Accepted for Final Jogger-Case Defendant|work=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|date=January 31, 1991|access-date=June 18, 2019}}</ref> He was sentenced in March 1991 to 1½ to 4½ years, after pleading guilty to the mugging of jogger John Loughlin.

==Serving time==
The four youngest of the five convicted defendants each served between six and seven years in juvenile facilities. Richardson, Salaam, and Santana attended classes. Each earned a [[GED]] and also completed an [[associate degree]] while there.<ref name="cook"/>

Richardson and Salaam were released in 1997.<ref name="Allah"/> Afterward Salaam talked about how important family was. He was part of an Islamic community and served as a spiritual leader at his youth facility, but talked about how important his mother's visits had been. He was held at a juvenile facility in upstate New York about five miles from the Canadian border and hours from New York City, but she came to see him three times a week.<ref name="Allah"/>

Wise had to serve all of his time in adult prison, and encountered so much personal violence that he asked to stay in isolation for extended periods. He was held at four different prisons, having asked for transfers in the hope of improving his situation.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}} He was released in August 2002, the last of the five men to leave prison.<ref name="Schanberg"/><ref name=additional>{{cite web | last1=Ross | first1=Barbara | last2=Brown | first2=Stephen Rex | title=EXCLUSIVE: Central Park Five seek an additional $52 million after reaching $41 million settlement for wrongful imprisonment in 1989 rape of jogger | work=New York Daily News | date=December 7, 2014 | url=https://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/central-park-pursue-money-41m-settlement-article-1.2036527 | access-date=February 4, 2020}}</ref>

Through this period, each of the five continued to maintain their innocence in the rape and attack of Meili, including at hearings before parole boards.

After an investigation into the defendants' innocence was conducted in 2002 by [[Robert Morgenthau]], [[New York County District Attorney|District Attorney for New York County]], the city withdrew all charges against the men, and the defendants' sentences were vacated.

=== Recommendation to vacate charges ===
[[File:NLN Yusef Salaam.jpg|thumb|Yusef Salaam in 2009, seven years after his conviction was vacated]]

As a result of his team's review, Reyes's confession, and DNA testing that confirmed he was the sole source of semen, District Attorney Robert Morgenthau recommended [[vacated judgment|vacating]] the convictions of the five defendants who had been convicted and sentenced to prison.<ref name="Morgenthau"/> Supporters of the five defendants again claimed that their confessions had been coerced by police.

During the re-investigation, the DA's office questioned the veracity of their confessions, because of their many inconsistencies and their lack of correspondence to established facts in the case. Morgenthau's office wrote:

<blockquote>A comparison of the statements reveals troubling discrepancies. ... The accounts given by the five defendants differed from one another on the specific details of virtually every major aspect of the crime—who initiated the attack, who knocked the victim down, who undressed her, who struck her, who held her, who raped her, what weapons were used in the course of the assault, and when in the sequence of events the attack took place. ... In many other respects the defendants' statements were not corroborated by, consistent with, or explanatory of objective, independent evidence. And some of what they said was simply contrary to established fact.<ref name="Morgenthau">{{cite web |url=http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/wise.pdf |title=Affirmation in Response to Motion to Vacate Judgment of Conviction: The People of the State of New York -against- Kharey Wise, Kevin Richardson, Antron McCray, Yusef Salaam, and Raymond Santana, Defendants |date=December 5, 2002 |author=Nancy E. Ryan|publisher=[[Robert M. Morgenthau]], [[District Attorney]], [[New York County]] |access-date=June 22, 2007}}</ref></blockquote>

In addition to the confessions, the report noted that a "reconstruction of the events in the park has bared a significant conflict, one that was hinted at but not explored in depth at the trials: at the time the jogger was believed to have been attacked, the teenagers were said to be involved—either as spectators or participants—in muggings elsewhere in the park."<ref name="dwyer.flynn"/> The report also noted: "Ultimately, there proved to be no physical or forensic evidence recovered at the scene or from the person or effects of the victim which connected the defendants to the attack on the jogger, or could establish how many perpetrators participated."<ref name="Morgenthau" /> In light of the "extraordinary circumstances" of the case, Morgenthau recommended that the court also vacate the convictions for the other crimes that night, such as robbery or assault, to which the defendants had confessed. His rationale was that the defendants' confessions to the other crimes were made at the same time and in the same statements as those related to the attack on Meili. Had the newly discovered evidence been available at the original trials, it might have made the juries question whether any part of the defendants' confessions was trustworthy.<ref name="Morgenthau" />

At the time and later, Morgenthau's recommendation to vacate the convictions was strongly opposed by [[Linda Fairstein]], who had directed the original prosecution; as well as by lead detectives on the case, and some other members of the police department.<ref name="Schanberg2">{{cite news|last=Schanberg|first=Sydney|author-link=Sydney Schanberg|date=November 26, 2002|title=A Journey Through the Tangled Case of the Central Park Jogger|work=[[The Village Voice]]|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/news/a-journey-through-the-tangled-case-of-the-central-park-jogger-6436053|access-date=August 21, 2007|quote=Every now and again, we get a look, usually no more than a glimpse, at how the justice system works.

==Aftermath==
Lawyers for the five defendants repeated their assessment that Trump's advertisements in 1989 had inflamed public opinion about the case. After Reyes confessed to the crime and said he acted alone, defense counselor Michael W. Warren said, "I think Donald Trump at the very least owes a real apology to this community and to the young men and their families."<ref name="NYT Oct 2002"/> Protests were held outside [[Trump Tower]] in October 2002 with protestors chanting, "Trump is a chump!"<ref name="NYT Oct 2002"/> Trump did not apologize.<ref name="NYT Oct 2002"/>

===Armstrong Report===

Following these events, in 2002, [[New York City Police Commissioner]] [[Raymond Kelly]] commissioned a panel to review the case, "To determine whether the new evidence [from the Reyes affidavit and related evidence, and Morgenthau's investigation] indicated that police supervisors or officers acted improperly or incorrectly, and to determine whether police policy or procedures needed to be changed as a result of the Central Park jogger case."<ref name="armstrong"/><ref name="ReferenceA">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/01/28/nyregion/boys-guilt-likely-in-rape-of-jogger-police-panel-says.html|title=Boys' Guilt Likely in Rape of Jogger, Police Panel Says|last=McFadden|first=Robert D.|date=2003|work=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=January 19, 2018|quote= A panel commissioned by the New York City Police Department concluded yesterday that there was no misconduct in the 1989 investigation of the Central Park jogger case, and said that five Harlem men whose convictions were thrown out by a judge last month had ''most likely'' participated in the beating and rape of the jogger. The panel also disputed the claim of Matias Reyes, a convicted killer and serial rapist, that he alone had raped the jogger.

In its January 2003 Armstrong Report, the panel "did not dispute the legal necessity of setting aside the convictions of the five defendants based on the new DNA evidence that Mr. Reyes had raped the jogger."<ref name="ReferenceA"/> But it disputed acceptance of Reyes's claim that he alone had raped the jogger.<ref name="ReferenceA"/><ref name="cnn.com"/> It said there was "nothing but his uncorroborated word" that he acted alone.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> Armstrong said the panel believed "the word of a serial rapist killer is not something to be heavily relied upon."<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

The report concluded that the five men whose convictions had been vacated had "most likely" participated in the beating and rape of the jogger and that the "most likely scenario" was that "both the defendants and Reyes assaulted her, perhaps successively."<ref name="ReferenceA"/> The report said Reyes had most likely "either joined in the attack as it was ending or waited until the defendants had moved on to their next victims before descending upon her himself, raping her and inflicting upon her the brutal injuries that almost caused her death."<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

Despite the analysis conducted by the District Attorney's Office, New York City detectives supported the 2003 Armstrong Report by the police department. The panel said there had been "no misconduct in the 1989 investigation of the Central Park jogger case."<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

As to the five defendants, the report said:

<blockquote>We believe the inconsistencies contained in the various statements were not such as to destroy their reliability. On the other hand, there was a general consistency that ran through the defendants' descriptions of the attack on the female jogger: she was knocked down on the road, dragged into the woods, hit and molested by several defendants, sexually abused by some while others held her arms and legs, and left semiconscious in a state of undress.<ref name="ReferenceA"/><ref name="cnn.com"/></blockquote>

==Contemporaneous cases compared by the media==

The Central Park events, which were attributed at the time to members of the large group of youths who attacked numerous persons in the park, including whites, blacks and Hispanics, were covered as an extreme example of the violence that was occurring in the city, including assaults and robberies, rapes and homicides. Focusing on rapes in the same week as the one in Central Park, ''The New York Times'' reported on April 29, 1989, on the "28 other first-degree rapes or attempted rapes reported across New York City".<ref name="Schanberg"/> The fourth one, on April 17, took place during the day in the park and is now tied to Reyes.<ref name="Schanberg"/>
