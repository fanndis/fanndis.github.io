The '''Belo Monte Dam''' (''formerly known as'' '''Kararaô''') is a [[hydroelectric dam]] complex on the northern part of the [[Xingu River]] in the [[Pará|state of Pará]], [[Brazil]]. After its completion, with the installation of its 18th turbine, in November 2019, the installed capacity of the dam complex is 11,233&nbsp;[[megawatt]]s (MW), which makes it the second largest hydroelectric dam complex in Brazil and [[List of largest hydroelectric power stations|fourth largest in the world]] by installed capacity, behind the [[Three Gorges Dam]] and the [[Xiluodu Dam]] in [[People's Republic of China|China]] and the Brazilian-[[Paraguay]]an [[Itaipu Dam]]. Considering the oscillations of flow river, guaranteed minimum capacity generation from the Belo Monte Dam would measure 4,571&nbsp;MW, 39% of its maximum capacity.<ref name=aneel>{{Cite web

Brazil's rapid economic growth over the last decade has provoked a huge demand for new and stable sources of energy, especially to supply its growing industries. In Brazil, [[hydroelectric power plants]] produce over 85% of the electrical energy. The Government has decided to construct new hydroelectric dams to guarantee national [[energy security]]. 
However, there is opposition both within Brazil and among the international community to the project's potential construction regarding its economic viability, the generation efficiency of the dams and in particular its impacts on the region's people and environment. In addition, critics worry that construction of the Belo Monte Dam could make the construction of other dams upstream- which could have greater impacts- more viable.
 
Plans for the dam began in 1975 but were soon shelved due to controversy; they were later revitalized in the late 1990s. In the 2000s, the dam was redesigned, but faced renewed controversy and controversial impact assessments were carried out. On 26 August 2010, a contract was signed with Norte Energia to construct the dam once the [[IBAMA|Brazilian Institute of Environment and Renewable Natural Resources (IBAMA)]] had issued an installation license. A partial installation license was granted on 26 January 2011 and a full license to construct the dam was issued on 1 June 2011. The licensing process and the dam's construction have been mired in federal court battles; the current ruling is that construction is allowed, because the license is based on five different environmental technical reports<ref>VIEIRA, Isabel (2011).

==History==
Plans for what would eventually be called the Belo Monte Dam Complex began in 1975 during [[Brazilian military government|Brazil's military dictatorship]], when [[Eletronorte]] contracted the Consórcio Nacional de Engenheiros Consultores (CNEC) to realize a [[Hydrographic survey|hydrographic]] study to locate potential sites for a hydroelectric project on the Xingu River. CNEC completed its study in 1979 and identified the possibility of constructing five dams on the Xingu River and one dam on the [[Iriri River]].<ref name="elehis"/>

Original plans for the project based on the 1979 study included two dams close to Belo Monte. These were: Kararaô (called Belo Monte after 1989), Babaquara (called Altamira after 1998) which was the next upstream.<ref name="elehis">{{Cite web|title=AHE Belo Monte – Evolucado Dos Estudos|url=http://www.eletrobras.com/elb/services/eletrobras/ContentManagementPlus/FileDownload.ThrSvc.asp?DocumentID=%7BD7EFE913-EA8E-42A7-8D28-5FFF2C719F46%7D&ServiceInstUID=%7B5947E09B-BDF0-4A21-A48F-518B42072401%7D&InterfaceInstUID=%7B75E11C49-A34C-4276-B9CE-256B5BE9EB6A%7D&InterfaceUID=%7B72215A93-CAA7-4232-A6A1-2550B7CBEE2F%7D&ChannelUID=%7B1D26C51F-7323-4BD4-A98C-C816FC6B58EB%7D&PageUID=%7B46763BB8-3B05-432F-A206-C8F93CC3BA90%7D&BrowserType=IE&BrowserVersion=6|publisher=Eletrobras|accessdate=7 March 2011|language=Portuguese}}</ref> Four other dams were planned upstream as well and they include the Ipixuna, Kakraimoro, Iriri and Jarina. The project was part of Eletrobras' "2010 Plan" which included 297 dams that were to be constructed in Brazil by 2010. The plan was leaked early and officially released in December 1987 to an antagonistic public. The plan had Belo Monte to be constructed by 2000 and Altamira by 2005. Such a speedy timetable was due to the belief that Brazil's relatively new environmental regulations could not stop large projects.<ref name="Fearnside">{{Cite web|last=Fearnside|first=Phillip M.|title=Dams in the Amazon: Belo Monte and Brazil's Hydroelectric Development of the Xingu River Basin|url=https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&q=cache:UaT2PxOKbRkJ:philip.inpa.gov.br/publ_livres/Preprints/2006/Belo%2520Monte%2520dec%2520making-EM-3.pdf+cnec+1975+belo+monte&hl=en&gl=us&pid=bl&srcid=ADGEEShMicMyIzdlicp3epTAHvpmhRwhMh17-JB31vVCcarqf2PW_JTco71GzvFGwz3Uq6WkltziP5rC5vSwWsrX0PUKolpwetk6s0-2vGMwoobx0K-ezZbMuRaG7y3ihJK6bCbYRvyN&sig=AHIEtbTG8xKdZsJ2U9z9D6vCPpXqEejiPQ|publisher=Environmental Management|accessdate=7 March 2011|date=12 January 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160120134112/http://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&q=cache%3AUaT2PxOKbRkJ%3Aphilip.inpa.gov.br%2Fpubl_livres%2FPreprints%2F2006%2FBelo%2520Monte%2520dec%2520making-EM-3.pdf+cnec+1975+belo+monte&hl=en&gl=us&pid=bl&srcid=ADGEEShMicMyIzdlicp3epTAHvpmhRwhMh17-JB31vVCcarqf2PW_JTco71GzvFGwz3Uq6WkltziP5rC5vSwWsrX0PUKolpwetk6s0-2vGMwoobx0K-ezZbMuRaG7y3ihJK6bCbYRvyN&sig=AHIEtbTG8xKdZsJ2U9z9D6vCPpXqEejiPQ|archive-date=20 January 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> The government offered little transparency to the people who would be affected regarding its plans for the hydroelectric project, provoking indigenous tribes of the region to organize what they called the ''I Encontro das Nações Indígenas do Xingu'' (First Encounter of the Indigenous Nations of the Xingu) or the "[[Altamira, Brazil|Altamira]] Gathering", in 1989. The encounter, symbolized by the indigenous woman leader Tuíra holding her machete against the face of then-engineer [[Eletrobras#List of current and former CEOs|José Antonio Muniz Lopes]] sparked enormous repercussions both in Brazil and internationally over the plans for the six dams. As a result, the five dams above Belo Monte were removed from planning and Kararaô was renamed to Belo Monte at the request of the people of that tribe. Eletronorte also stated they would "resurvey the fall", meaning resurvey the dams on the river.<ref name="Fearnside"/><ref name="urlTenotã–mõ Executive Summary">

===Redesign===
Between 1989 and 2002, the Belo Monte project was redesigned. The reservoir's surface area was reduced from {{Convert|1225|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}} to {{Convert|440|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}} by moving the dam further upstream. The main rationale for this was to reduce flooding of the Bacajá Indigenous Area. In 1998, the Babaquara Dam was again placed into planning but under a new name, the Altamira Dam. This surprised local leaders as they felt plans for the dams above Belo Monte were cancelled. Some officials in Brazil were determined to build a dam on a river with an average flow of {{Convert|7800|m3/s|ft3/s|0|abbr=on}} and at a site that offers a {{Convert|87.5|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} drop. One engineer said of the dam: "God only makes a place like Belo Monte once in a while. This place was made for a dam."<ref name="Fearnside"/> President of Eletronorte, José Muniz Lopes, in an interview with the newspaper O Liberal (Belo Monte entusiasma an Eletronorte por Sônia Zaghetto, 15 July 2001), affirmed: <blockquote>"''Within the electric sector's planning for the period 2010/2020, we’re looking at three dams – Marabá (Tocantins river), Altamira (previously called Babaquara, Xingu River) and Itaituba (São Luís do Tapajós). Some journalists say that we are not talking about these dams because we’re trying to hide them. It’s just that their time has not yet come. We’re now asking for authorization to intensify our studies for these dams. Brazil would be greatly benefited if we could follow Belo Monte with Marabá, then Altamira and Itaituba.''"<ref name="urlTenotã–mõ Executive Summary" /></blockquote>

===Second study===
In 2002, Eletronorte presented a new environmental impact assessment for the Belo Monte Dam Complex, which presented three alternatives. Alternative A included the six original dams planned in 1975. Alternative B included a reduction to four dams, dropping Jarina and Iriri. Alternative C included a reduction to Belo Monte only. The new environmental impact assessment contained reductions in reservoir size and the introduction of a [[Run-of-the-river hydroelectricity|run-of-the-river]] model, in contrast to the large reservoirs characteristic of the 1975 plans.<ref>

Also in 2002, Workers' Party leader [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva]] earned a victory in his campaign for president, having originally run unsuccessful campaigns in [[Brazilian presidential election, 1989|1989]], [[Brazilian general election, 1994|1994]] and [[Brazilian general election, 1998|1998]]. Lula soon brokered political deals with the center and right-wing sectors in 2003, especially with ex-president [[José Sarney]] of the state of Maranhão of the PMDB, which would set the precedent that eventually characterized the two Lula administrations: [[Public-private partnership|cooperation between the market and the state]], a combination of a free market economy with larger social spending and welfare. This economic model provided the rationale and financial support for new efforts to construct Belo Monte. In 2007, at the beginning of Lula's second term in office, a new national investment program was introduced: the [[Programa de Aceleração do Crescimento]] (Program to Accelerate Growth). The Belo Monte Dam Complex figured as an anchor project of the new investment plan.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

In 2008, another new environmental impact assessment was written, this time by Eletrobras with the participation of [[Odebrecht]], [[Camargo Corrêa]], and [[Andrade Gutierrez]], which formally accepted Alternative C or the construction only of the Belo Monte dam itself. The assessment also presented further design changes; in order to avoid inundating indigenous territory, which is not permitted by the Brazilian Constitution, the new design included two canals to divert the water away from indigenous territories and into a reservoir called the ''Reservatorio dos Canais'' (Canals Reservoir). An additional reservoir would be created called the ''Reservatorio da Calha do Xingu'' (Xingu Riverbed Reservoir), and electricity would be generated from the two reservoirs using three dams: a complementary powerhouse called Pimental (233 MW), a complementary spillway called Bela Vista, and the main powerhouse called Belo Monte (11,000 MW). The ''Reservatorio dos Canais'' would be retained by over a dozen large dikes, and water from the reservoirs would be channeled towards the main powerhouse.<ref>

However, transparency of the government's plans once again became an issue, sparking indigenous tribes of the region to organize another large meeting, called the ''Segundo Encontro dos Povos do Xingu'' (the Second Encounter of the Peoples of the Xingu) in the city of Altamira, Pará on 20 May 2008.<ref name="urlBBC - Bruce Parrys Amazon-The Kayapo">{{Cite web

On 26 August 2010, President [[Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva]] signed the contract with the Norte Energia at a ceremony in Brasília. Construction was not permitted to begin on the Belo Monte Dam Complex until IBAMA granted the second of the federally required environmental licenses, called the Installation License.

===Federal Court cases===
On 25 February 2011, the Federal Public Prosecutor filed its 11th lawsuit against Belo Monte Dam, suspending IBAMA's partial installation license, on the grounds that the Brazilian Constitution does not allow for the granting of partial project licenses. The Federal Public Prosecutor also argued that the 40&nbsp;social and environmental conditions tied to IBAMA's provisional license of February 2010 had yet to be fulfilled, a prerequisite to the granting of a full installation license.<ref name=reuters250211/> On 25 February 2011, Brazilian federal judge Ronaldo Destêrro blocked the project citing environmental concerns.<ref

===Design flaw===
Shortly before the planned installation of the dam's last (18th) turbine in November 2019, it was revealed that catastrophic failure of the dam was possible due to exposure of an unprotected area of the dam wall to wave action in the then prevailing low water level.  In an 11 October 2019 Norte Energia report, the company's CEO requested more water from an intermediate reservoir to add to the dangerously low 95.2 meter water level.<ref name=Watts2019>{{cite news|newspaper=The Guardian|title=Poorly planned Amazon dam project 'poses serious threat to life' |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/nov/08/death-of-a-river-the-ruinous-design-flaw-in-a-vast-amazon-rainforest-dam|last=Watts|first=Jonathan|date=8 November 2019|access-date=9 November 2019}}</ref>

===Capacity===
Walter Coronado Antunes, the former Secretary of the Environment of the state of São Paulo, and ex-President of the state water and sanitation utility [[Sabesp]], has said that the Belo Monte Dam Complex would be one of the least efficient hydro-power projects in the history of Brazil, producing only 10% of its 11,233&nbsp;MW nameplate capacity between July and October (1,123&nbsp;MW, and an average of only 4,419&nbsp;MW throughout the year, or a 39% [[capacity factor]]).<ref name=antunes>{{Cite journal

===Availability===
Critics claim that the project would only make financial sense if the Brazilian government builds additional dam reservoirs upstream to guarantee a year-round flow of water, thus increasing the [[Availability factor|availability]] of generation. Supporters of the project point out that the seasonal minimum flow of the Xingu river occurs at a time when other Brazilian hydro plants are well supplied,{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} so that no additional dams would have to be built. Reportedly, Brazil's National Council for Power Policies approved a resolution, previously sanctioned by then president Lula, that only one hydroelectric dam would be built on the Xingu. With one dam, critics do not see a cost-to-benefit ratio advantage and question the government's decision to construct only one.<ref name=small>{{cite news|title=Brazilian government claims only a 'small minority' oppose Belo Monte dam|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/feb/18/brazil-belo-monte-dam|publisher=Guardian UK|accessdate=9 March 2011|location=London|date=18 February 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921043753/http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/feb/18/brazil-belo-monte-dam|archive-date=21 September 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Economics==
{{anchor|Project finance}}
The dam complex is expected to cost upwards of $16&nbsp;billion and the transmission lines $2.5&nbsp;billion. The project is being developed by the state-owned power company [[Eletronorte]], and would be funded largely by the [[Brazilian Development Bank]] (BNDES).<ref name=aw>{{Cite web| publisher= Amazon Watch| url= http://www.amazonwatch.org/amazon/BR/bmd/| title= Belo Monte Dam| accessdate= 13 May 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070607094832/http://www.amazonwatch.org/amazon/BR/bmd/| archivedate= 7 June 2007| url-status= dead}}</ref> The project will also include substantial amounts of funding from Brazilian pension funds Petros, Previ, and Funcef. Private investors interested in the project include mining giants [[Alcoa]] and [[Vale do Rio Doce|Vale]] (to power new mines nearby like the proposed [[Belo Sun]] gold mine<ref name=Watts2019/>), construction conglomerates [[Andrade Gutierrez]], Votorantim, Grupo OAS, Queiroz Galvão, Odebrecht and [[Camargo Corrêa]], and energy companies [[GDF Suez]] and Neoenergia.

In 2006, Conservation Strategy Fund (CSF) analyzed different cost-benefit scenarios for Belo Monte as an energy project, excluding environmental costs. Initial benefits appeared marginal. When simulating energy benefits using a modeling system it became obvious that Belo Monte would require additional upstream dams to provide water storage for dry season generation. CSF concluded that Belo Monte would not be sustainable without the proposed Altamira (Babaquara) dam which would have a reservoir more than 10 times the size of Belo Monte's, flood 30 times the area submerged by Belo Monte, [[Indigenous territory (Brazil)|indigenous territories]] of the [[Araweté]]/Igarapé Ipixuna, [[Koatinemo]], [[Kayapo|Arara]], [[Kararaô]], and [[Cachoeira Seca do Irirí]] natives.<ref name="urlBelo Monte Dam-CSF">{{Cite web

Due to the project's lack of economic viability and lack of interest from private investors, the government has had to rely on pension funds and lines of credit from BNDES that draw from the [[:pt:Fundo de Amparo ao Trabalhador|Workers' Assistance Fund]], oriented towards paying the public debt, to finance the project; up to one-third of the project's official cost would be financed by incentives using public money.<ref>"Incentivos federais chegam a 1/3 do valor de Belo Monte," {{cite web |url=http://economia.terra.com.br/noticias/noticia.aspx?idNoticia=201004200945_RED_78907085 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-04-20 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706154528/http://economia.terra.com.br/noticias/noticia.aspx?idNoticia=201004200945_RED_78907085 |archivedate=6 July 2011}}</ref>

===Alternatives===
[[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF-Brazil]] released a report in 2007 stating that Brazil could cut its expected demand for electricity by 40% by 2020 by investing in [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]]. The power saved would be equivalent to 14 Belo Monte hydroelectric plants and would result in national electricity savings of up to R$33&nbsp;billion (US$19&nbsp;billion).<ref>To download the report, see WWF-Brazil and Greenpeace, http://www.climatesolver.org/source.php?id=1252339{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

Ex-director of ANEEL Afonso Henriques Moreira Santos stated that large dams such as Belo Monte were not necessary to meet the government's goal of 6% growth per year. Rather, he argued that Brazil could grow through increasing its installed capacity in [[wind power]], currently only at 400 MW.<ref>Governo criará "monstro", diz ex-diretor da Aneel http://clippingmp.planejamento.gov.br/cadastros/noticias/2010/4/24/governo-criara-monstro-diz-ex-diretor-da-aneel{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

However, a study by the [[Federal University of Rio de Janeiro]], published in June 2011, criticised some of these alternative suggestions and defended the Belo Monte dam project. They state that compared to the estimated costs of alternative energies, the Belo Monte dam is cheaper both in economic and in socio-environmental costs.<ref>de Castro, Nivalde J., da Silva Leite, André L., and de A.

===Incomplete environmental assessment===
In February 2010, Brazilian environmental agency IBAMA granted an environmental license for the construction of the dam despite uproar from within the agency about incomplete information in the [[Environmental Impact Assessment]] (EIA) written by Eletrobras, Odebrecht, Camargo Corrêa, and Andrade Gutierrez.<ref name=csf2>{{Cite news | publisher=BBC |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8492577.stm | title = Brazil grants environmental licence for Belo Monte dam | accessdate=2 February 2010 | date=2 February 2010 | first=Gary | last=Duffy| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100202023432/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8492577.stm| archivedate= 2 February 2010 | url-status= live}}</ref> Previously in October 2009, a panel composed of independent experts and specialists from Brazilian universities and research institutes issued a report on the EIA, finding "various omissions and methodological inconsistencies in the EIA..."

===Greenhouse gas budget===
The [[National Institute of Amazonian Research|National Amazon Research Institute]] (INPA) calculated that during its first 10&nbsp;years, the Belo Monte-Babaquara dam complex would emit 11.2&nbsp;million [[tonne|metric tons]] of [[Carbon dioxide equivalent]], and an additional 0.783&nbsp;million metric tons of {{chem|CO|2}} equivalent would be generated during construction and connection to the national energy grid.<ref name=UFPA>{{Cite web |url=http://www.periodicos.ufpa.br/index.php/ncn/article/view/315/501 |title=Periódicos UFPA |access-date=9 March 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100630215626/http://www.periodicos.ufpa.br/index.php/ncn/article/view/315/501 |archive-date=30 June 2010 |url-status=live }}</ref> This independent study estimates greenhouse gas emissions of an amount that would require 41 years of optimal energy production from the Belo Monte Dam complex (including the now aborted Altamira Dam) in order to reach environmental sustainability over fossil fuel energy.<ref name=UFPA/>

Dams in Brazil emit high amounts of methane, due to the lush jungle covered by waters each year as the basin fills. Carbon is trapped by foliage, which then decays anaerobically with help from [[methanogens]], converting the carbon to methane, which is a more potent greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide. As a result, carbon emissions are emitted from the dam each year it is in operation. A 1990 study of the [[Curuá-Una Dam]], also in Brazil, found that it pollutes 3.5 times more in carbon dioxide equivalent than an oil power plant generating an equal amount of electricity would;<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn7046 |title=Hydroelectric Power's Dirty Secret Revealed |access-date=24 August 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150710060545/http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn7046 |archive-date=10 July 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref> not in the form of the CO2 atmospheric pollution associated with fossil fuel burning, but as the more dangerous methane emissions. Furthermore, the forest will be cleared before flooding of the area, so the CO2 and methane emissions calculated for the flooding of the forested area will be significantly undercut.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} In addition, a study on the Brazilian [[Tucuruí dam]] showed that the actual greenhouse gas emissions were a factor ten higher than its official calculations showed, and this dam is no exception; it is feared that the Belo Monte Dam calculations are also deliberately undercutting reality and that the flooding of its [[reservoir]] will create a similar situation.<ref>Fearnside, Phillip M.

However, in the case of [[Tucuruí dam|Tucuruí]], only the economically necessary forest was cut (10%, near the opening to the spillway) and the rest was left intact to be flooded by the reservoir. The contractors had sold the logging rights to the flooded area, but found the plot unviable in the short amount of time they had allocated before the area was set to be flooded. This forest has been decaying under the water through [[Methanogenesis]] and producing large amounts of greenhouse gases.

===IBAMA report===
The IBAMA's environmental impact assessment has listed the following possible impacts:

* The generation of expectations towards the future of the local population and indigenous people;
* An increase in population and uncontrolled land occupation;
* An increase in the needs of services and goods, as well as job demand;
* A loss of housing and economic activities due to the transfer of population;
* Improvements on the accessibility of the region;
* Changes in the landscape, caused by the installation of support and main structures for the construction of the dam;
* Damage to the archaeological estates in the area;
* Permanent flooding of shelters in Gravura Assurini;

However, a clarification was released by the Brazilian authorities, in which it was deemed that the assured social and economic benefits, considered for the environmental redesign and the region's infrastructural developments, would outweigh the expected environmental damage.<ref>IBAMA (1 June 2011).
