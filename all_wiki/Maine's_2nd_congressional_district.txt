'''Maine's 2nd congressional district''' is a [[congressional district]] in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Maine]]. Covering {{convert|27326|sqmi|km2}}, it comprises nearly 80% of the state's total land area. It is the [[List of United States congressional districts by area|largest district]] east of the [[Mississippi River]] and the 24th-largest overall. It is the second-most rural district in the United States, with 72.11% of its population in rural areas; [[Kentucky's 5th congressional district]] is larger.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://proximityone.com/cd113_2010_ur.htm|title=Congressional Districts – 113th Congress Demographics – Urban Rural Patterns|work=proximityone.com|accessdate=September 12, 2015}}</ref>

The district comprises most of the land area north of the [[Portland, Maine|Portland]] and [[Augusta, Maine|Augusta]] metropolitan areas. It includes the cities of [[Lewiston, Maine|Lewiston]], [[Bangor, Maine|Bangor]], [[Auburn, Maine|Auburn]], and [[Presque Isle, Maine|Presque Isle]]. It also included the city of [[Waterville, Maine|Waterville]] until 2011, when Maine's congressional redistricting process following the [[2010 United States Census|2010 U.S. Census]] led to a shift of district boundaries within [[Kennebec County, Maine|Kennebec County]].

The district is represented by [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Jared Golden]], who took office in 2019.

Historically, the district has tended to elect members from both the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] and [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] parties and keep its incumbents. When Golden defeated two-term [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] incumbent [[Bruce Poliquin]] in 2018, it was the first time an incumbent had lost reelection in the district since 1916.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/15/us/politics/poliquin-maine-loses.html|title=Maine’s Bruce Poliquin, Lone Republican in House From New England, Loses Re-election|author1=Kate Taylor|author2=Liam Stack|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|date=November 15, 2018}}</ref>

Since 1965, the district's representatives have frequently sought statewide office. Three U.S. senators (Democrat [[William Hathaway]], Republicans [[William Cohen]] and [[Olympia Snowe]]), one governor (Democrat [[John Baldacci]]), and one nominee for governor (Democrat [[Mike Michaud]]) all previously held the seat.

==History==
Until the [[Missouri Compromise]] was reached in 1820, Maine was a part of [[Massachusetts]] as the [[District of Maine]]. When it became a state in 1820, Maine had seven congressional districts credited to it (Massachusetts including Maine had been given 20 districts after the [[1810 United States Census|1810 Census]]). Since Maine became a state, all but two districts have been [[United States congressional apportionment#Reapportionment|reallocated to other states]].

In 2018 the district became the first in the United States to elect the [[ranked choice voting|ranked choice]] winner over the [[First-past-the-post voting|first-past-the-post]] winner, after a referendum in 2016 changed Maine's electoral system from the latter system to the former. Incumbent representative Bruce Poliquin won a plurality of the first preference votes. However, the second and third preferences from two independent candidates flowed overwhelmingly to Jared Golden, allowing him to win with 50.6% of the vote once all preferences were distributed.

===Election results from presidential races===
In [[United States presidential election|US presidential elections]], most [[U.S. state|states]] give all the state's [[United States Electoral College|electoral votes]] to the candidate that wins the statewide popular vote. This is a type of [[Plurality voting|winner-takes-all voting]]. Maine and Nebraska instead use the [[United States Electoral College#Congressional district method|congressional district method]], where the winner in each of the state's congressional districts gets one electoral vote, and the statewide winner gets an additional two electoral votes. Since Maine introduced this system in 1969, Maine's second district voted the same way as the entire state of Maine for every election until [[2016 United States presidential election|2016]].

==Composition==
The boundaries of the District are open for reconsideration in light of population shifts revealed by the decennial US Census. Until 2011, Maine's constitution provided for the state to reapportion the Congressional districts based on census data every ten years beginning in 1983, which would have meant that the state was next due to consider redistricting in 2013. However, a federal lawsuit filed in March 2011 led to a requirement that Maine speed up its redistricting process.<ref>{{cite news|last=Associated Press|year=2011|title=Lawsuit aims to speed Maine redistricting|url=http://bangordailynews.com/2011/03/29/politics/federal-lawsuit-aims-to-speed-maine-redistricting/|work=Bangor Daily News|accessdate=December 17, 2012}}</ref> Maine state legislators approved new boundaries on September 27, 2011.<ref>{{cite web|last=Russell|first=Eric|year=2011|title=After long partisan fight, redistricting deal keeps boundaries much the same|url=http://bangordailynews.com/2011/09/27/politics/redistricting-deal-would-keep-district-lines-much-the-same|work=Bangor Daily News|accessdate=December 17, 2012}}</ref>
