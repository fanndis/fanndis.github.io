It is the [[capital city]] of [[Piedmont]] and of the [[Metropolitan City of Turin]], and was the first Italian capital from 1861 to 1865. The city is mainly on the western bank of the [[Po (river)|Po River]], below its [[Susa Valley]], and is surrounded by the western [[Alps|Alpine arch]] and [[Superga]] Hill.

The city used to be a major European political centre. From 1563, it was the capital of the [[Duchy of Savoy]], then of the Kingdom of Sardinia ruled by the [[House of Savoy]], and the first capital of the [[Kingdom of Italy]] from 1861 to 1865.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comune.torino.it/canaleturismo/en/history.htm|title=The city's history|work=Turismo e promozione|publisher=Città di Torino|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070818061240/http://www.comune.torino.it/canaleturismo/en/history.htm|archivedate=18 August 2007|url-status=dead|access-date=31 August 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/travel/travel-factsheet/turin--culture-amp-history-20081128-6m77.html|title=Turin – Culture & History|date=|work=Sydney Morning Herald|access-date=26 December 2009}} {{dead link|date=August 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}</ref> Turin is sometimes called "the cradle of Italian liberty" for having been the birthplace and home of notable individuals who contributed to the ''[[Italian unification|Risorgimento]]'', such as [[Camillo Benso, conte di Cavour|Cavour]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ohio.edu/Chastain/ac/cavour.htm|title=Cavour, Count Camillo Benso di (1810–1861)|date=22 April 1998|publisher=Ohio.edu|access-date=26 December 2009}}</ref> Even though much of its political significance and importance had been lost by [[World War II]], Turin became a major European crossroad for industry, commerce and trade, and is part of the famous "industrial triangle" along with [[Milan]] and [[Genoa]].

The city has a rich culture and history, being known for its numerous [[art museum|art galleries]], restaurants, churches, palaces, [[opera house]]s, [[piazza]]s, parks, gardens, theatres, libraries, museums and other venues. Turin is well known for its [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]], [[Baroque]], [[Rococo]], [[Neoclassicism|Neo-classical]], and [[Art Nouveau]] architecture. Many of Turin's [[Town square|public squares]], castles, gardens and elegant ''[[palazzo|palazzi]]'' such as the [[Palazzo Madama, Turin|Palazzo Madama]], were built between the 16th and 18th centuries. A part of the historical center of Turin was inscribed in the [[World Heritage List]] under the name [[Residences of the Royal House of Savoy]]. In addition, the city is home to museums such as the [[Museo Egizio]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.italiantourism.com/egizio.html |title=ITALIA – Egyptian Museum of Turin |publisher=Italiantourism.com |access-date=26 December 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100103130040/http://italiantourism.com/egizio.html |archive-date=3 January 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and the [[Mole Antonelliana]] which in turn hosts the [[Museo Nazionale del Cinema]].

=== Ancient origins ===
The [[Taurini]] were an ancient [[Celto-Ligurian]]<ref>Livy XXI, 38: ''Taurini semigalli''.</ref> [[Alpine race|Alpine]] people, who occupied the upper valley of the [[Po River]], in the center of modern [[Piedmont]].
In 218 BC, they were attacked by [[Hannibal]] as he was allied with their long-standing enemies, the [[Insubres]]. The Taurini chief town (''Taurasia'') was captured by Hannibal's forces after a three-day siege.<ref>[[Polybius]] iii. 60, 8</ref> As a people they are rarely mentioned in history. It is believed that a [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] colony was established after 28 BC under the name of ''Julia Augusta Taurinorum'' (modern Turin). Both [[Livy]]<ref>v. 34</ref> and [[Strabo]]<ref>iv. p.&nbsp;209</ref> mention the Taurini's country as including one of the passes of the [[Alps]], which points to a wider use of the name in earlier times.

=== Roman era ===
In the 1st century BC (probably 28 BC), the Romans founded  ''Augusta Taurinorum''. Via Garibaldi traces the exact path of the Roman city's [[Decumanus Maximus|decumanus]] which began at the ''Porta Decumani'', later incorporated into the ''Castello'' or ''Palazzo Madama''. The ''Porta Palatina'', on the north side of the current city centre, is still preserved in a park near the cathedral. Remains of the Roman-period [[Roman theatre (structure)|theatre]] are preserved in the area of the ''Manica Nuova''. Turin reached about 5,000 inhabitants at the time, all living inside the high city walls.

=== Middle Ages ===
[[File:Umberto_Biancamano_di_Savoia.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Humbert I of Savoy]]]]
After the fall of the [[Western Roman Empire]], the town was conquered by the [[Heruli]] and the [[Ostrogoths]], recaptured by the [[Byzantine Empire|Romans]], but then conquered again by the [[Lombards]] and then the [[Franks]] of [[Charlemagne]] (773). The ''[[March of Turin|Contea di Torino]]'' (countship) was founded in the 940s and was held by the [[Arduin of Italy|Arduinic]] dynasty until 1050. After the marriage of [[Adelaide of Susa]] with [[Humbert I, Count of Savoy|Humbert Biancamano]]'s son [[Otto, Count of Savoy|Otto]], the family of the [[House of Savoy|Counts of Savoy]] gained control. While the title of count was held by the Bishop as count of [[County of Turin|Turin]] (1092–1130 and 1136–1191) it was ruled as a [[Prince-Bishop|prince-bishopric]] by the Bishops. In 1230–1235 it was a lordship under the [[List of rulers of Montferrat|Marquess of Montferrat]], styled Lord of Turin. At the end of the 13th century, when it was annexed to the Duchy of Savoy, the city already had 20,000 inhabitants. Many of the gardens and palaces were built in the 15th century when the city was redesigned. The [[University of Turin]] was also founded during this period.

=== Early modern ===
[[File:"S. Sindone in gloria di angeli, il Miracolo Eucaristico, i Santi". Torino, Giovanni Boglietto, 1701.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Turin in 1701]]
[[Emmanuel Philibert, Duke of Savoy|Emmanuel Philibert]], also known under the nickname of ''Iron Head'' (Testa 'd Fer), made Turin the capital of the Duchy of Savoy in 1563. Piazza Reale (named [[Piazza San Carlo]] today) and Via Nuova (current Via Roma) were added along with the first enlargement of the walls, in the first half of the 17th century; in the same period the ''Palazzo Reale'' ([[Royal Palace of Turin]]) was also built. In the second half of that century, a second enlargement of the walls was planned and executed, with the building of the arcaded Via Po, connecting Piazza Castello with the bridge on the Po through the regular street grid.

In 1706, during the [[Battle of Turin]], the French besieged the city for 117 days without conquering it. By the [[Treaty of Utrecht]] the Duke of Savoy acquired [[Sicily]], soon traded for [[Sardinia]], and part of the former [[Duchy of Milan]], and was elevated to king; thus Turin became the capital of a European kingdom. The architect [[Filippo Juvarra]] began a major redesign of the city; Turin had about 90,000 inhabitants at the time.

=== Late modern and contemporary ===

[[File:6 maggio 1945 liberazione torino.jpg|thumb|Liberation parade in Turin, May 6, 1945]]

Turin, like the rest of [[Piedmont]], was annexed by the [[First French Empire|French Empire]] in 1802. The city thus became the seat of the [[Prefectures in France|prefecture]] of [[Pô (department)|Pô]] [[Departments of France|department]] until the fall of [[Napoleon I|Napoleon]] in 1814, when the Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia was restored with Turin as its capital. In the following decades, the Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia led the struggle towards the [[Italian unification|unification of Italy]]. In 1861, Turin became the capital of the newly proclaimed united [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Kingdom of Italy]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.italiansrus.com/articles/torinohistory_part4.htm |title=Turin's History |publisher=Italianrus.com. Anthony Parenti |access-date=9 May 2010}}</ref> until 1865, when the capital was moved to [[Florence]], and then to [[Rome]] after the 1870 conquest of the [[Papal States]]. The 1871 opening of the [[Fréjus Rail Tunnel|Fréjus Tunnel]] made Turin an important communication node between Italy and France. The city in that period had 250,000 inhabitants. Some of the most iconic landmarks of the city, like the [[Mole Antonelliana]], the [[Museo Egizio|Egyptian Museum]], the [[Gran Madre di Dio, Turin|Gran Madre di Dio church]] and ''Piazza Vittorio Veneto'' were built in this period. The late 19th century was also a period of rapid industrialization, especially in the automotive sector: in 1899 [[Fiat]] was established in the city, followed by [[Lancia]] in 1906. The [[Prima Esposizione Internazionale d'Arte Decorativa Moderna|Universal Exposition]] held in Turin in 1902 is often regarded as the pinnacle of [[Art Nouveau]] design, and the city hosted the same event in [[Turin International|1911]]. By this time, Turin had grown to 430,000 inhabitants.

After [[World War I]], harsh conditions brought a wave of strikes and workers' protests. In 1920 the [[Lingotto]] Fiat factory was occupied. The Fascist regime put an end to the social unrest, banning trade unions and jailing socialist leaders, notably [[Antonio Gramsci]]. On the other hand, [[Benito Mussolini]] largely subsidised the automotive industry, to provide vehicles to the army.

Turin [[Bombing of Turin in World War II|was then a target of Allied strategic bombing during World War II]], being heavily damaged by the air raids in its industrial areas as well as in the city centre. Along with [[Milan]], [[Genoa]], and [[La Spezia]], Turin was one of Italy's four cities that experienced [[area bombing]] by the RAF; the heaviest raid took place on 13 July 1943, when 295 bombers dropped 763 tons of bombs, killing 792 people.<ref>[http://www.museotorino.it/view/s/3e6222e913ac45a49cbd7f81960f1cc7 Museotorino - Bombardamento 13 luglio 1943]</ref> Overall, these raids killed 2,069 inhabitants of Turin, and destroyed or damaged 54% of all buildings in the city.<ref>[http://www.istoreto.it/torino38-45/download/torino38-45.pdf TORINO 1938|45. Una guida per la memoria]</ref><ref>[http://www.torinoinguerra.it/scheda_parola.asp?ID=10 Torinoinguerra - Bombardamenti]</ref>

The Allied's [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|campaign in Italy]] started off from the [[Southern Italy|South]] and slowly moved northwards in the following two years, leaving the northern regions occupied by Germans and collaborationist forces for several years. Turin was not captured by the Allies until the end of [[Spring 1945 offensive in Italy|Spring Offensive of 1945]]. By the time the vanguard of the armoured reconnaissance units of [[Brazilian Expeditionary Force]] reached the city, it was already freed by the [[Italian resistance movement|Italian Partisans]], that had begun revolting against the Germans on 25 April 1945. Days later, troops from the US Army's [[1st Armored Division (United States)|1st Armored]] and [[92nd Infantry Division (United States)|92nd Infantry Divisions]] came to substitute the Brazilians.<ref>[[Willis D. Crittenberger]], "The final campaign across Italy"; year of edition 1952 {{ISBN|85-7011-219-X}}</ref><ref>[[Mascarenhas de Moraes]], ''The Brazilian Expeditionary Force, By Its Commander'' US Government Printing Office, 1966. ASIN B000PIBXCG</ref>

In the postwar years, Turin was rapidly rebuilt. The city's automotive industry played a pivotal role in the [[Italian economic miracle]] of the 1950s and 1960s, attracting hundreds of thousands of immigrants to the city, particularly from the rural southern regions of Italy. The number of immigrants was so big that Turin was said to be "the third southern Italian city after [[Naples]] and [[Palermo]]". The population soon reached 1&nbsp;million in 1960 and peaked at almost 1.2&nbsp;million in 1971. The exceptional growth gains of the city gained it the nickname of ''the Automobile Capital of Italy'' and ''the [[Detroit]] of Italy'' (Turin has been "twinned" with Detroit since 1998). In the 1970s and 1980s, the oil and automotive industry crisis severely hit the city, and its population began to sharply decline, losing more than one-fourth of its total in 30 years. The long population decline of the city has begun to reverse itself only in recent years, as the population grew from 865,000 to slightly over 900,000 by the end of the century. In 2006, Turin hosted the [[2006 Winter Olympics|Winter Olympic Games]].

== Geography ==
[[File:142957main iss012e15598 torino.jpg|upright=1.35|thumb|225px|Turin from space (north is on the left)]]
Turin is in [[northwest Italy]]. It is surrounded on the western and northern front by the Alps and on the eastern front by a high hill that is the natural continuation of the hills of [[Montferrat|Monferrato]]. Four major rivers pass through the city: the Po and three of its tributaries, the [[Dora Riparia]] (once known as ''Duria Minor'' by the Romans, from the [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] noun ''duria'' meaning "water"), the [[Stura di Lanzo]] and the [[Sangone (torrent)|Sangone]].

=== Climate ===
Turin features a European-[[humid subtropical climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Cfa''), as does most of northern Italy.

Winters are moderately cold and dry, summers are mild in the hills and quite hot in the plains. Rain falls mostly during spring and autumn; during the hottest months, otherwise, rains are less frequent but heavier (thunderstorms are frequent). During the winter and autumn months banks of fog, which are sometimes very thick, form in the plains<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comune.torino.it/canaleturismo/en/clima.htm |title=Torino Turistica – Servizio Telematico Pubblico – Città di Torino |publisher=Comune.torino.it |access-date=6 May 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090429121444/http://www.comune.torino.it/canaleturismo/en/clima.htm |archivedate=29 April 2009}}</ref> but rarely on the city because of its location at the end of the [[Susa Valley]].

Its position on the east side of the [[Alps]] makes the weather drier than on the west side because of the [[föhn wind]] effect.

{{See also|List of mayors of Turin|City Council of Turin}}
Turin is split up into 8 [[borough]]s, locally called ''[[Circoscrizione|circoscrizioni]]'';<ref name="circoscrizioni">{{cite news|title=Città di Torino - Circoscrizioni|url=http://www.comune.torino.it/decentr/|access-date=18 April 2020|date=22 November 2019|language=it}}</ref> these do not necessarily correspond to the historical districts of the city, which are rather called ''[[Quartiere|quartieri]]'', ''[[Rione|rioni]]'', ''borghi'', ''borgate'' or ''zone''. The "circoscrizioni" system originally comprised 10 of them, that were reduced to 8 by merging borough 9 into 8, and 10 into 2.

The following list numerates the boroughs and the location of the historical districts inside them:<ref name="circoscrizioni"/>
* Circoscrizione 1: Centro – Crocetta
* Circoscrizione 2: Santa Rita – Mirafiori Nord – Mirafiori Sud
* Circoscrizione 3: San Paolo – Cenisia – Pozzo Strada – Cit Turin – Borgata Lesna
* Circoscrizione 4: San Donato – Campidoglio – Parella
* Circoscrizione 5: Borgo Vittoria – Madonna di Campagna – Lucento – Vallette

* Circoscrizione 7: [[Aurora (Turin)|Aurora]] – Vanchiglia – Sassi – Madonna del Pilone
* Circoscrizione 8: San Salvario – Cavoretto – Borgo Po – Nizza Millefonti – [[Lingotto]] – Filadelfia

The Mayor of Turin is directly elected every five years. The current mayor of the city is [[Chiara Appendino]] ([[Five Star Movement|M5S]]), elected on 20 June 2016.

== Cityscape ==

=== City centre ===
{{See also|Residences of the Royal House of Savoy}}

[[File:Torino, via Roma (01).jpg|thumb|right|''Via Roma'']]

Turin's historical architecture is predominantly [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] and was developed under the [[Kingdom of Savoy]]. Nonetheless, the main street of the city centre, ''Via Roma'', was built during the Fascist era (from 1931 to 1937) as an example of [[Italian Rationalism]], replacing former buildings already present in this area.

Via Roma runs between [[Piazza Carlo Felice]] and [[Piazza Castello, Turin|Piazza Castello]]. Buildings on the portion between Piazza Carlo Felice and [[Piazza San Carlo]] were designed by rationalist architect [[Marcello Piacentini]]. These blocks were built into a reticular system, composed by austere buildings in clear rationalist style, such as the impressive ''Hotel Principi di Piemonte'' and the former ''Hotel Nazionale'' in ''Piazza CLN''. Porches are built in a continuous [[entablature]] and marked with double columns, to be consistent with those of Piazza San Carlo. The section of the street between Piazza San Carlo and Piazza Castello was built in an eclectic style, with arcades characterised by [[Serliana]]-type arches. To this day Via Roma is the street featuring the most fashionable boutiques of the city.

[[File:Torino - Caval ëd Brons latoB.jpg|thumb|right|''Piazza San Carlo'' and the ''Caval 'd Brons'' (Bronze Horse in Piedmontese language) equestrian monument to [[Emanuele Filiberto, Duke of Savoy|Emmanuel Philibert]]]]

Via Roma crosses one of the main squares of the city: the pedestrianized Piazza San Carlo, built by [[Carlo di Castellamonte]] in the 17th century. In the middle of the square stands the equestrian monument to [[Emanuele Filiberto, Duke of Savoy|Emmanuel Philibert]], also known as ''Caval ëd Brons'' in the local dialect ("Bronze Horse"); the monument depicts the Duke sheathing his sword after the [[Battle of St. Quentin (1557)|Battle of St. Quentin]]. Piazza San Carlo arcades host the most ancient cafés of the city, such as ''Caffé Torino'' and ''Caffé San Carlo''.

[[File:529TorinoPalazzoReale.JPG|thumb|left|''Piazza Castello'' with [[Royal Palace of Turin|Palazzo Reale]] (Royal Palace) in the background]]

On the northern edge of Via Roma stands ''Piazza Castello'', regarded as the heart of the city. The half-pedestrianized square hosts some significant buildings such as ''Palazzo Reale'' (Former Savoy Royal House), the ''Palazzo Madama'' (which previously hosted the Savoy senate and, for few years, the Italian senate after Italian unification), the former Baroque [[Teatro Regio di Torino]] (rebuilt in modern style in the 1960s, after being destroyed by fire), the [[Royal Library of Turin]] which hosts the [[Portrait of a man in red chalk (Leonardo)|Leonardo da Vinci self-portrait]], and the baroque [[San Lorenzo, Turin|Royal Church of San Lorenzo]]. Moreover, Piazza Castello hosts a Fascist era building, the [[Torre Littoria]], a sort of skyscraper which was supposed to become the headquarters of the Fascist party, although it never served as such. The building's style is quite different from the Baroque style of Piazza Castello. The square regularly hosts the main open space events of the city, live concerts included.

[[File:Porta Nuova Station Turin.jpg|thumb|left|''Porta Nuova'' main railway station]]

As for the southern part of the street, Via Roma ends in ''Piazza Carlo Felice'' and in its ''Giardino Sambuy'', a wide fenced garden right in the middle of the square. Across from Piazza Carlo Felice stands the monumental façade of [[Torino Porta Nuova railway station|Porta Nuova railway station]], the central station of the city built between 1861 and 1868 by the architect Alessandro Mazzucchetti. The passengers building was renovated to host a shopping mall and more efficient passenger service offices. However, it is still an example of monumental architecture, with its stately foyer and some Baroque sights, such as the ''Sala Reale'' (the former Royal waiting room).

[[File:Torino, piazza Vittorio Veneto (04).jpg|thumb|right|''Piazza Vittorio Veneto'' square]]

In ''Piazza Castello'' converge some of the main streets of the city centre. Among them, one of the most significant is the arcaded ''Via Po'', built by [[Amedeo di Castellamonte]] in 1868 and featuring some interesting buildings, such as the first and original building of the [[University of Turin]] and the historical [[Caffè Fiorio]], which was the favourite café of the 19th-century politicians. Via Po ends in [[Piazza Vittorio Veneto, Turin|Piazza Vittorio Veneto]] (simply called Piazza Vittorio locally), the largest Baroque square in Europe and today heart of Turin nightlife. Piazza Vittorio features the most fashionable bars and not far from here, along the [[Po (river)|Po]] riverfront, the ''Murazzi'' quays used to host several bars and nightclubs open till the morning until a few years ago.

[[File:Piazza and Palazzo Carignano - panoramio.jpg|thumb|right|Baroque façade of [[Palazzo Carignano]], the [[Museum of the Risorgimento (Turin)|Museum of the Risorgimento]]]]

Parallel to Via Roma, the other two popular pedestrian streets, namely ''Via Lagrange'' and ''Via Carlo Alberto'', cross the old town from Via Po to ''Corso Vittorio Emanuele II''. Their recent pedestrianisation has improved their original commercial vocation. In particular, Via Lagrange has recently increased the presence of luxury boutiques. This street also hosts the [[Museo Egizio|Egyptian Museum of Turin]], home to what is regarded as one of the largest collections of Egyptian antiquities outside of Egypt.

Via Lagrange and Via Carlo Alberto cross two significant squares of the city, respectively. The former crosses ''Piazza Carignano'', well known mainly for the undulating “concave – convex-concave” Baroque façade of [[Palazzo Carignano]]. This building used to host the ''Parlamento Subalpino'' (the “Subalpine Parliament”, [[Parliament of the Kingdom of Sardinia]] which also became the Italian Parliament for a few years, after the Italian unification) and today houses the [[Museum of the Risorgimento (Turin)|Museum of the Risorgimento]]. The square also features the [[Teatro Carignano]], a well-conserved Baroque theatre.
Via Carlo Alberto crosses ''Piazza Carlo Alberto'', a big square hosting the rear façade of Palazzo Carignano, in eclectic style. On the other side stands the monumental ''Biblioteca Nazionale'' (National Library).

[[File:Torino-mole10.jpg|thumb|left|[[Mole Antonelliana]] some years ago.]

Not far from Via Po stands the symbol of Turin, namely the [[Mole Antonelliana]], so named after the architect who built it, [[Alessandro Antonelli]]. Construction began in 1863 as a Jewish [[synagogue]]. Nowadays it houses the [[National Museum of Cinema]] and it is believed to be the tallest museum in the world at {{convert|167|m|ft|abbr=off}}. The building is depicted on the Italian 2-cent coin.

[[File:Cupola sindone.jpg|thumb|left|Dome of [[Turin Cathedral]]]]

Just behind ''Piazza Castello'' stands the [[Turin Cathedral]], dedicated to Saint [[John the Baptist]], which is the major church of the city. It was built during 1491–1498 and is adjacent to an earlier [[bell tower]] (1470). Annexed to the cathedral is the [[Chapel of the Holy Shroud]], the current resting place of the [[Shroud of Turin]]. The chapel was added to the structure in 1668–1694, designed by [[Guarino Guarini|Guarini]]. The [[Basilica of Corpus Domini]] was built to celebrate an alleged miracle which took place during the sack of the city in 1453, when a soldier was carrying off a [[monstrance]] containing the [[Blessed Sacrament]]; the monstrance fell to the ground, while the [[Sacramental bread|host]] remained suspended in air. The present church, erected in 1610 to replace the original chapel which stood on the spot, is the work of [[Ascanio Vitozzi]].

[[File:Torino - Porta Palatina.jpg|thumb|right|[[Palatine Towers]]]]

Next to the Turin Cathedral stand the [[Palatine Towers]], an ancient [[Architecture of ancient Rome|Roman]]-medieval structure that served as one of four Roman [[city gate]]s along the [[city walls]] of Turin. This gate allowed access from north to the ''[[cardo]] maximus'', the typical second main street of a Roman town. The Palatine Towers are among the best preserved Roman remains in northern Italy. Close to this site, the {{convert|51,300|m2|0|adj=mid|abbr=off}} ''Piazza della Repubblica'' plays host to the biggest open market in Europe, locally known as ''mercato di Porta Palazzo'' (''Porta Palazzo'' or ''Porta Pila'' are the historical and local names of this area).

West of the Porte Palatine stands the ''Quadrilatero Romano'' (Roman Quadrilateral), the old medieval district recently renewed. The current neighbourhood is characterised by its tiny streets and its several medieval buildings and today it is popular for its ''[[Apéritif and digestif|aperitivo]]'' bars and its small shops run by local artisans. The hub of the Quadrilatero is ''Piazza Emanuele Filiberto''.

South of the Quadrilatero Romano stands ''Via Garibaldi'', another popular street of the city. It is a {{convert|1|km|1|abbr=on}} pedestrian street between Piazza Castello and ''Piazza Statuto'' which features some of the old shops of the city. Large ''Piazza Statuto'' is another example of Baroque square with arcades.

[[File:Nouvelle gare TGV de Turin Porta Susa.jpg|thumb|left|[[Torino Porta Susa railway station|''Porta Susa'' railway station]]]]

Another main street of downtown is ''Via Pietro Micca'', which starts in Piazza Castello and ends in the large ''Piazza Solferino''. The street continues in ''Via Cernaia'' up to ''Piazza XXV Dicembre'', which features the former [[Porta Susa]] passengers building, relocated in 2012 a little more southward. The new and larger passengers building is situated between ''Corso Bolzano'' and ''Corso Inghilterra'' and is an example of contemporary architecture, being a {{convert|300|m|ft|adj=mid|abbr=off|-long}} and {{convert|19|m|ft|adj=mid|abbr=off|-high}} glass and steel structure. Porta Susa is currently the international central station of the city (high speed trains to Paris) and it is becoming the central hub of railway transportation of the city, being the station in which local trains (so-called ''Ferrovie Metropolitane''), national trains and high-speed national and international trains converge.

Close to Via Cernaia stands the ''Cittadella'' (Citadel), in the ''Andrea Guglielminetti garden''. What remains of the old medieval and modern fortress of the city, it is a starting point for a tour into the old tunnels below the city.

=== San Salvario ===
[[File:Borgo medievale TO.jpg|thumb|''Borgo Medievale'']]
[[File:Valentino castle.jpg|thumb|right|[[Castello del Valentino]] in [[Parco del Valentino]]]]

Southeast of the city centre stands ''San Salvario'' district, which extends from ''Corso Vittorio Emanuele II'' to ''Corso Bramante'' and is delimited by the [[Turin-Genoa railway]] on the west side and by the Po river on the east side. Home to an increasing immigrants' community, the district is an example of integration among different cultures; it also features an incremented nightlife after the opening of several low-cost bars and restaurants.

San Salvario is crossed by two main roads, ''Via Nizza'' and ''Via Madama Cristina'', and just as the city centre it is characterised by the [[grid plan]] typical of Turin's old neighbourhoods. The hub of the district is ''Piazza Madama Cristina'' which hosts a big open market, while several commercial activities flourish around it.

The celebrated [[Parco del Valentino]] is situated in the east side of San Salvario and, albeit not in downtown, it represents kind of central park of Turin. Thanks to the vicinity to the city centre, the park is very popular among the local people, during the day but also at night, because of the several bars and nightclubs placed here. From the terraces of Parco del Valentino, many sights of the hills on the other side of the river can be appreciated.

In the centre of the park stands the [[Castello del Valentino]], built in the 17th century. This castle has a horseshoe shape, with four rectangular towers, one at each angle, and a wide inner court with a marble pavement. The ceilings of the false upper floors are in ''transalpino'' (i.e. French) style. The façade sports the huge coat of arms of the [[House of Savoy]]. Today, Castello del Valentino serves as the faculty of Architecture of the ''[[Polytechnic University of Turin]]''.

Another cluster of buildings in the park is the ''Borgo Medievale'' (Medieval village), a replica of medieval mountain castles of Piedmont and Aosta Valley, built for the 1884 [[World's fair|International Exhibition]].

Other buildings in ''Corso Massimo d'Azeglio'' include the [[Torino Esposizioni]] complex (Turin's exhibition hall built in the 1930s) featuring a monumental entrance with a large full height porch, a main hall designed by [[Pier Luigi Nervi]] in reinfored concrete, and the ''Teatro Nuovo'', a theatre mostly focused on ballets exhibitions. Another building is the largest synagogue of the city, in ''Piazzetta Primo Levi'', a square. Its architecture stands in the main sight of the city, as characterised by four large towers – {{convert|27|m|ft|abbr=off}} high – topped by four onion-shaped domes.

=== Crocetta ===
[[File:MonumentoVittorioEmanueleII.JPG|thumb|right|''Monumento a Vittorio Emanuele II'']]
[[File:Politecnico di Torino.JPG|thumb|The [[Polytechnic University of Turin]].|alt=]]
[[File:Boulevard Spina Centrale Torino.JPG|thumb|left|The ''Spina Centrale'' is a new under-construction boulevard built over the undergrounded railway. It is already completed in ''Crocetta.'']]

South of ''Centro'' stands the ''Crocetta'' district, considered one of the most exclusive districts of the city, because of highly rated residential buildings. At the heart of the district is the partially pedestrianised area crossed by ''Corso Trieste'', ''Corso Trento'' and ''Corso Duca D'Aosta'', plenty of some notable residential buildings in eclectic, neo-Gothic and Art Nouveau style. The area was built between 1903 and 1937 replacing the old [[parade ground]], which was moved in the Southern part of the city.

North of this area stands the ''GAM (Galleria d'Arte Moderna)'', one of the two Museum of Modern Arts of the Turin Metro area (the second and largest one is hosted in ''Castello di Rivoli'', a former Savoy Royal castle in the suburbs). The Museum stands in front a huge monument situated in the centre of the roundabout between ''Corso Vittorio Emanuele II'' and ''Corso Galileo Ferraris'': the [[Monument to Vittorio Emanuele II (Turin)|Monument to Vittorio Emanuele II]], a King of Savoy statue situated on a 39-meters high column. Next to the Museum, another significant residential building previously hosted the head office of [[Juventus]], one of the two main Turin football clubs.

West of this area, the main building of [[Polytechnic University of Turin]] stands along ''Corso Duca Degli Abruzzi''. The 1958 building, a {{convert|122,000|m2|0|adj=mid|abbr=off}} complex, hosts approximately 30,000 students and is considered one of the major Institutes of Technology of the country – mainly due to the vocation of the city for the industrialisation, pushed by the automotive sector. This institute recently expanded in the western district of ''Cenisia'' with additional modern buildings.

Crocetta is crossed by large and modern avenues, such as ''Corso Duca degli Abruzzi'', ''Corso Galileo Ferraris'', and ''Corso Einaudi''. These avenues feature long rows of trees, symbolic of Turin's typical urbanity. However, the most popular avenue is ''Corso De Gasperi'', which, albeit smaller than other avenues of the district, hosts one of the most fashionable open markets of the city, the so-called ''Mercato della Crocetta'', in which it is possible to find some discounted branded clothing among the more popular ones.

The Western border of Crocetta is instead an example of contemporary architecture. The huge avenue, made up of ''Corso Mediterraneo'' and ''Corso Castelfidardo'', is part of ''Spina Centrale'' boulevard and was recently built over the old railway (now undergrounded): as a result, the avenue is very large (up to {{convert|60|m|ft|abbr=off}}) and modern, having been rebuilt with valuable materials, including a characteristic lighting system supported by white high poles. This avenue hosts some examples of contemporary art, such as [[Mario Merz]]'s ''Igloo'' fountain or the [[Per Kirkeby]]'s ''Opera per Torino'' monument in ''Largo Orbassano''.

The East side of the district is also known as ''Borgo San Secondo'' named after the church of the same name standing in ''Via San Secondo'', a major street in the neighbourhood. This is near ''Porta Nuova'' railway station and is older than the rest of the district, featuring several apartment buildings from the late 19th century, to include the birthplace and home of author [[Primo Levi]] on Corso Re Umberto.<ref>Levi, Primo (19 January 1989).  [https://www.nybooks.com/articles/1989/01/19/my-house/ "My House."] Translated by Raymond Rosenthal.  ''[[The New York Review of Books]]''.  Retrieved 14 May 2020.</ref> A local open market is held in ''Piazza San Secondo'' and along ''Via Legnano''. The market square also hosts the former washhouse and public baths of the neighbourhood, among the oldest examples of their kind in Turin (1905).

One of the main thoroughfares crossing Borgo San Secondo is ''Via Sacchi'', which serves as an ideal gate to the city centre: its Serlian arcades on the west side of the street (the east side is enclosed by ''Porta Nuova'' railway station service buildings) host some significant boutiques and hotels, such as the historic ''Pfatisch'' pastry shop and the ''Turin Palace Hotel'' (totally refurbished and reopened in 2015). South of ''Via Sacchi'', ''Ospedale Mauriziano'' is one of the ancient and major hospitals of the city. Going further southwards, it is possible to appreciate an interesting residential cluster of old public housing gravitating around ''Via Arquata''.

[[File:Aperitif for four.JPG|thumb|left|A typical Italian ''[[Aperitivo]]'']]

Bordered by ''Corso Castelfidardo'', ''Corso Vittorio Emanuele II'', ''Corso Trapani'' and ''Corso Peschiera'', this small district is mainly significant for hosting the recent expansion of Turinese [[Institute of Technology]] ''[[Polytechnic University of Turin|Politecnico]]''. The expansion was possible after under-grounding the railway under ''Corso Castelfidardo'' and the subsequent disposal of the old buildings dedicated to the train maintenance present in this area (so-called ''Officine Grandi Riparazioni'' or ''OGR''). ''Politecnico'' expanded its facilities through two huge overpass buildings over the avenue, linked to new buildings on the west side. This cluster of buildings forms an evocative square with a unique architectural style. The main building on the west side hosts a [[General Motors]] research centre, the ''General Motors Global Propulsion Systems'' (formerly known as ''General Motors Powertrain Europe''). ''Politecnico'' area extends till ''Via Boggio'' with further facilities hosted in the former ''OGR'' facilities. The Institute plans to further build new facilities in the current parking area.

North of ''Politecnico'' facilities, the main building of the ''OGR'' former cluster, which consists in three 180-meters long joint parallel buildings, became recently a big open space which hosts temporary exhibitions and during the hot seasons, its external spaces became a fashionable site to have a typical Italian ''[[aperitivo]]''.

North of ''OGR'', a former prison complex called ''Le Nuove'' is a significant example of old European prison building. The complex was built between 1857 and 1869 during the reign of Victor Emmanuel II. After being disposed of during the 1990s, the complex was changed into a museum and it is possible to visit its facilities.

An example of contemporary art is the heating plant in ''Corso Ferrucci'', which has been covered with aluminium panels. Another building (19th century), now abandoned, is the former [[Westinghouse Brakes#Rail vehicles|Westinghouse]] factory of train brakes situated in ''Via Borsellino''.

The remaining part of the district is mainly formed by residential buildings with not significant architectural value. The district had its development mainly after the World War II, following the industrial development of the town – in particular, the expansion of [[Lancia]] automotive factories in the ''Borgo San Paolo'' neighbourhood, culminated in the construction of [[Palazzo Lancia]] in 1954, the company's former headquarters. Industrialization led to consequent population growth in the nearby areas, including ''Cenisia''. Main avenues which are crossing the district are ''Corso Ferrucci'' and ''Corso Racconigi''. This last one is hosting a huge daily open market, the ''Mercato di Corso Racconigi''.

=== Cit Turin ===
[[File:Palazzo della Vittoria - panoramio (3).jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|''Casa della Vittoria'' (1918-1920) is an example of Turin's neo-gothic architecture.]]

The smallest district of the city is ''Cit Turin'' ("Little Turin" in [[Piedmontese language]]). This small triangle surrounded by ''Corso Vittorio Emanuele II'', ''Corso Francia'' and ''Corso Inghilterra'' hosts some high rated residential buildings and is regarded as a prestigious residential neighbourhood by local people.

[[File:Grattacielo Intesa San Paolo - panoramio (3).jpg|thumb|left|[[Intesa Sanpaolo]] banking group headquarters]]

The district features many buildings in [[Art Nouveau]], [[Art Deco]] and [[Neo-Gothic]] style. Among them, one of the most impressive and well known is the ''[[Casa della Vittoria]]'' (architect ''Gottardo Gussoni''). Another notable example is [[Casa Fenoglio-Lafleur]]. Both buildings face Corso Francia.

The district is well known for its commercial vocation mainly in its two main streets, ''Via Duchessa Jolanda'' and ''Via Principi d'Acaja'', ideally crossing each other among the gardens ''Giardino Luigi Martini'', locally called ''Piazza Benefica'', which hosts a popular open market.

The district is also characterised by two massive recent buildings: the ''Palazzo di Giustizia'', Turin's new courthouse built in the 1990s (in a 350-metre long facility), and the first real skyscraper of Turin, the [[Torre Intesa Sanpaolo]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.world.intesasanpaolo.com/en/call_to_action/intesa-s-turin-tower-is-named-one-of-the-10-most-environmentally-friendly-new-buildings-in-the-world|title=Intesa's Turin tower is named one of the 10 most environmentally friendly new buildings in the world – Intesa Sanpaolo World|author=|date=|work=intesasanpaolo.com}}</ref> which house the headquarters of one of the major Italian private banks.

=== San Donato ===
[[File:Torino-CampanileChiesaDiNostraSignoradelSuffragio.png|thumb|upright=0.7|''Chiesa di Nostra Signora del Suffragio e Santa Zita'']]
[[File:Torre littoria Torino.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|The [[Torre Littoria]]]]

''San Donato'' district is between ''Corso Francia'', ''Corso Lecce'', ''Corso Potenza'', ''Via Nole'', the ''Parco Dora'' and ''Corso Principe Oddone''. It was populated since the medieval era, but becomes bigger during the 19th century, prospering around the canal ''Canale di San Donato'', which does not exist any more, currently replaced by the central street of the district, ''Via San Donato''. Buildings in the district are relatively recent (around 1820), except for the oldest group of small houses in the ''Brusachœr'' neighbourhood (''Palazzo Forneris'' building) along ''Via Pacinotti'' near the small ''Piazza Paravia''. The conservation of the street and of this old building influences the straightness of ''Via San Donato'', which makes a slight curve to result in parallel with ''Via Pacinotti'' before ending in central ''Piazza Statuto ''square.

Main church of the district is the ''Chiesa di Nostra Signora del Suffragio e Santa Zita'', which with its {{convert|83|m|ft|abbr=off}} height of its bell tower, is well known to be the fifth tallest structure in the city of Turin, after the [[Mole Antonelliana]], the [[Intesa Sanpaolo|Intesa-Sanpaolo skyscraper]], the [[Torre Littoria]] and the two pennons of the [[Juventus Stadium]]. The church is hosting the ''Istituto Suore Minime di Nostra Signora del Suffragio'' and it was promoted and designed by [[Francesco Faà di Bruno]]. The legend says, that he wanted to build the tallest bell tower of the town and put a clock on the top, to all the poor people to know the time for free. The small building near the church is what remains of ''Casa Tartaglino'', a small residential building which was also extended and modified by Faa di Bruno.

''Villino Cibrario'' in ''Via Saccarelli'' is another significant building designed by Barnaba Panizza in 1842. The building was equipped with a large garden which was eliminated to host the street. The neighbourhood has a high concentration of historic buildings in Art Nouveau style designed by architect Pietro Fenoglio (among the others, the prestigious ''Villino Raby'' in Corso Francia 8). Other significant buildings are the  ''Villa Boringhieri'' in Via San Donato, and other Art Nouveau and Neo-Gothic buildings are situated in ''Via Piffetti ''and ''Via Durandi.''

Among the modern buildings of the district, the most significant one is, of course, the ''Torre BBPR'' Tower (which took the name from the architecture office who designed it). The building is representing the ''post-rationalism Italian architecture'' (same style of the better known [[Torre Velasca]] tower in the city of Milan). The tower is facing the central ''Piazza Statuto'' square.
The district is crossed by some significant avenues: on ''Corso Svizzera'', which crosses the district from North To South, faces the Business Centre ''Piero Della Francesca'', where the offices of ''Tuttosport,'' one of the three national sports daily newspapers has its head offices. Also on ''Corso Svizzer''a, stands one of the oldest hospitals of the city, the ''Ospedale Amedeo di Savoia'', specialised in infectious diseases. Other major avenues are ''Corso Umbria'' and ''Corso Tassoni''.

Another big avenue, which borders the district on its East, is ''Corso Principe Oddone'', which in the past was along the railway to Milan. Currently the railway has been under-grounded: the avenue will be enlarged and have same architecture style of southern ''Corso Inghilterra'' in downtown, becoming one of the major avenue of Turin.
The northern part of the district was part of the former industrial district of Turin, recently reconverted to a park called ''Parco Dora''. Mainly, in ''San Donato'' the portion reconverted was the one occupied by the plant of [[Michelin]] (west of ''Via Livorno'') and [[Fiat|FIAT]] ironwork plants (on the East). Differently for other portions of ''Parco Dora'', this part has been totally reconverted to park without letting any evidence of the industrial area except for the cooling tower which stands along ''Corso Umbria'' and became a symbol of the park. Works are completed in the western area, where ''Corso Mortara'' has been closed to traffic and moved just a bit northern and covered by an artificial tunnel. It is possible to access the southern shore of the ''Dora'' river. South of the Park, an interesting architecture of different levels is hosting a new shopping mall called ''Centro Commerciale Parco Dora''. East of ''Via Livorno'', works are still partially in progress, with the Dora river still to be uncovered by a big slab, on which the [[Fiat|FIAT]] plants used to stand). West of ''Via Livorno'', the ''Environment Park'' is a research centre for renewable energy.

=== Aurora ===
[[File:BorgoDora.JPG|thumb|right|Tiny streets of ''Borgo Dora'']]

''Aurora'' is one of the most ancient districts which developed out of the medieval [[Defensive wall|city walls]], north of the historical city centre. It stretches from downtown northern boundaries in ''Corso Regina Margherita'' (an extended and important thoroughfare of Turin) up to ''Corso Vigevano'' and ''Corso Novara'' in the North Side (namely the old [[excise]] boundary till the early 20th century); the western boundary is ''Corso Principe Oddone'' (now part of the ''Spina Centrale'' boulevard) and the eastern border is the Dora river.

The district was named Aurora after the so-called ''Cascina Aurora'', an old farmstead lying north of the Dora river, right at the intersection between ''Corso Giulio Cesare'' and ''Corso Emilia''. The farmstead has long been demolished and the area has been converted to office buildings, hosting the Turinese textile company ''Gruppo Finanziario Tessile'' (''GFT'') headquarters until the early 21st century.

The historical hub of the district is ''Borgo Dora'' (The "Dora Borough"), a small neighbourhood next to ''Porta Palazzo'' and enclosed by ''Corso Regina Margherita'', ''Via Cigna'', the Dora river and ''Corso Giulio Cesare''. Once known as ''Borgo del Pallone'' (literally "Ball Borough") or ''Balon'' in [[Piedmontese dialect]] ({{IPA-it|baˈlun|local}}), this neighbourhood is famous for its ''mercatino del Balon'' or simply ''Balon'', the Turinese [[flea market]] that opens every Saturday in its tiny and twisted streets. Borgo Dora hosts several remarkable places, such as: ''Piccola Casa della Divina Provvidenza'' ("Little House of the Divine Providence"), also known as ''Cottolengo'', a well-known charitable organization which has been operating for almost 200 years in the city; ''Arsenale della Pace'' ("Arsenal of Peace"), a former weapons factory that currently hosts the headquarters of ''SERMIG'' (''Servizio Missionario Giovani''), a nonprofit association which assists poor and homeless people; ''Caserma Cavalli'' ("Cavalli Barracks"), one of the most representative buildings of the district, a former barracks topped by a clock tower which now hosts ''Scuola Holden'', a storytelling and performing arts school; the evocative ''Cortile del Maglio'' ("Mallet Courtyard"), a covered pedestrian area featuring bars and clubs. Across from Cortile del Maglio and Arsenale della Pace stands a wide pedestrian area which features a [[hot air balloon]], a clear allusion to the neighbourhood's old name ''Balon'': recently installed, the balloon is open to public which can now take an interesting view of the city from this new high observation point.

Right at the borders of Borgo Dora stands part of ''Porta Palazzo'' open market which hosts the [[New Exhibition Hall (Turin)|New Exhibition Hall]], designed by the Italian architect [[Massimiliano Fuksas]]. The building has replaced the ''Clothes Market'', one of the four covered pavilions of Porta Palazzo market, but unfortunately, this glass green-shaded building has been highly criticized because of its lack of usability for commercial activities, albeit an example of contemporary architecture.

Another interesting building at the borders of the neighbourhood is [[Torino Porta Milano railway station|Porta Milano]] (a.k.a. ''stazione della Ciriè-Lanzo''), a former 19th-century railway station that marked the terminus of Ciriè-Lanzo railway line until the 1980s. To this day, the station is no longer in use as well as the rails up to ''Piazza Baldissera''. The station building was recently renovated and now hosts some old locomotives, even though it is not open to the public. Unfortunately, the old rails crossing the district are totally disused and neglected, adding decay to the whole area.

Borgo Dora, as many other pockets of Aurora, is characterized by the marked multi-ethnicity of its population, being home to a large community of immigrants from emerging countries.

[[File:Santuario di Maria Ausiliatrice Torino.jpg|thumb|right|''Santuario di Maria Ausiliatrice'']]

West of Borgo Dora stands ''Rione Valdocco'' ("Valdocco neighbourhood"), enclosed by ''Via Cigna'', ''Corso Regina Margherita'', ''Corso Principe Oddone'' and the Dora river. This neighbourhood hosts the significant architecture of ''Santuario di Maria Ausiliatrice'' ("Maria Ausiliatrice Sanctuary") in the homonymous square and behind the church stands ''San Pietro in Vincoli'' old cemetery.

Overall, the main thoroughfares of the West side of Aurora are ''Via Cigna'', which crosses the district from North to South, ''Corso Vercelli'', a historical avenue starting north of the Dora river, and ''Corso Principe Oddone'', part of the long ''Spina Centrale'' boulevard that will be built over the underground [[Turin-Milan railway]]. However, the Spina Centrale project is proceeding slowly because of the lack of funds and the boulevard is still occupied by a large worksite along its span. Once completed, Aurora district will be connected to Eastern ''San Donato'', thanks to a better connection among the roads of the two adjacent districts (i.e. ''Corso Ciriè'' will continue in ''Corso Gamba'' and ''Strada del Fortino'' in ''Corso Rosai'').

As for the rest of Aurora, the district is crossed by an important thoroughfare named ''Corso Giulio Cesare'', a long boulevard that extends from Porta Palazzo up to [[Autostrada A4 (Italy)|Turin-Trieste motorway]] entrance in the Northern urban fringe of Turin. Other significant roads are ''Corso Palermo'', ''Via Bologna'' and ''Corso Regio Parco'', mostly in the East side of Aurora which is known as ''Borgo Rossini'' ("Rossini Borough"). Albeit not a road, the Dora river is also a significant element for the whole district, since it completely crosses it from West to East.

[[File:Caffè corretto (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|[[Lavazza]], famous Turin coffee brand]]

The area north of the river features a mix of old residential buildings and remains of former factories and facilities from the 20th century. An example are the remains of [[FIAT]] ''Officine Grandi Motori'' (''OGM'') in Corso Vigevano, an old factory that produced big industrial and automotive Diesel engines, a sort of symbol of the industrial history of Turin. Another disused facility is ''Astanteria Martini'' ("Martini Emergency Department") in Via Cigna, a former emergency department from the 1920s which has been lying vacant since long.

As for the old residential buildings of the area, this part of Aurora hosts the oldest [[public housing]] block of the city, built by ''Istituto Autonomo Case Popolari'' (''IACP'') in 1908 in lieu of an old dilapidated small farm once known as ''Chiabotto delle Merle''.

Despite its run-down look, the famous [[Lavazza]] coffee company, along with ''IAAD'' School of Design, chose this part of the city as the location for their new headquarters, which will be built in a contemporary building dubbed ''Nuvola'' ("Cloud") right at the borders of ''Borgo Rossini''. Designed by the architect Gino Zucchi, this project is still a work in progress but excavations in the area revealed the remains of a medieval cemetery and an early Christian basilica; these findings will be preserved and will be shown to the public.

''Borgo Rossini'' hosts a number of businesses, for instance, the ''[[Kappa (company)|Robe di Kappa]]'' flagship store (Kappa is a noted Italian sportswear brand founded in Turin) and the ''Cineporto'' ("Cineport") a.k.a. ''La Casa dei Produttori'' ("The Filmmakers' House", which hosts the ''Turin Piedmont Film Commission Foundation'').

=== Vanchiglia ===
[[File:Torino, grattacielo della Regione Piemonte (03).jpg|right|thumb|[[Piedmont Region Headquarters]] (209 m), one of the tallest skyscrapers in Italy]]
[[File:La Fetta di Polenta - panoramio.jpg|left|thumb|upright=0.7|Fetta Di Polenta, northern side]]
''Vanchiglia'' is bordered by ''Corso San Maurizio, Corso Regio Parco'' and the Po river, crossed also by the [[Dora Riparia]] river and by two big avenues, ''Corso Regina Margherita'' and ''Corso Tortona''.

''Borgo Vanchiglia'' is the historical district: a little triangle next to downtown, situated between ''Corso San Maurizio, Corso Regina Margherita'' and the [[Po (river)|Po]] river. The district is quite popular nowadays because being quite closer to the heart of Turin nightlife ''Piazza Vittorio Veneto,'' many bars and restaurants opened recently in this area. However, Vanchiglia also includes the area called ''Vanchiglietta'', north of ''Borgo Vanchiglia''.

Notable church in ''Borgo Vanchiglia'' is the French neo-Gothic ''Chiesa di Santa Giulia'' situated into ''Piazza Santa Giulia''.

A notable and unusual building in the area is the so-called ''"[[Fetta di Polenta]]"'' (literally: "[[polenta]] slice"), formerly known as ''Casa Scaccabarozzi.'' This building is where ''Corso San Maurizio'' meets ''Via Giulia di Barolo'', and it is one of the most peculiar examples of Turin architecture: a thin trapezoid 27 meters wide on ''Via Giulia Di Barolo'', 5 meters on ''Corso San Maurizio'' and just 0.70 meters wide on the opposite end. It was designed in 1840 by [[Alessandro Antonelli]] for his wife, Francesca Scaccabarozzi, probably because of a bet. The curious name comes from the shape of the palace, which resembles a "slice of polenta", and also because it is painted with an ocher colour.

In the surroundings, in ''Via Vanchiglia 8'', (although in downtown and not really in ''Vanchiglia'' anymore) there is another trapezoid house, albeit with less extreme design: similarly, this building is nicknamed ''"Fetta di Formaggio"'' (cheese slice), built in 1832 for the rich ''Marchese Birago di Vische'' by the architect ''Antonio Talentino''.

Other notable buildings are the town public baths, eclectic building built in 1905 (''Corso Regina Margherita'' crossing ''Via Vanchiglia''), and the''Teatro della Caduta'' theatre, opened in 2003 in ''Via Michele Buniva 23'', which with its 45 seats is the smallest theatre in Turin and among the smallest theatres in Europe.

In Corso Regina Margherita, another notable building is the former ''Opera pia Reynero'', a charitable organization. The building was built in 1892. Being abandoned for a long time after it closed in 1996, it was then occupied by the Askatasuna Social Center, a non-profit anarchic organization, hosting since then various activities such as concerts, dinners, seminars and homeless solidarity initiatives.
[[File:Campus Luigi Einaudi Torino - panoramio (1).jpg|thumb|upright=2.8|Campus Luigi Einaudi]]
North of ''Corso Regina Margherita'', district is losing the flavour and architecture typical of Turin downtown, cause a significant portion of the district was formerly occupied by factories, nowadays partially abandoned or replaced by modern buildings. A significant example was the area occupied by gas companies between Corso Regina Margherita and the Dora river, which were partially demolished to make place to the new modern Faculty of Law building (Campus "Luigi Einaudi"), designed by the architect [[Norman Foster (architect)|Norman Foster]]. This building was classified by the American television company CNN among the 10 most spectacular university buildings in the world.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/spectacular-university-buildings/index.html|title=10 of the world's most spectacular university buildings to impress travellers |date=19 February 2014|work=CNN Travel|access-date=10 August 2017}}</ref> In the campus courtyard, a large wood statue representing a bull (symbol of Turin) has been erected by [[Mario Ceroli]]. The area hosts also a student campus.

Next to the campus, a new cycling and pedestrian bridge on the Dora river was opened on 16 April 2010, linking the campus area to ''Corso Verona.'' Bridge is entitled to the architect ''Franco Mellano''.

''Parco Colletta'' is a big park area touched by the two rivers of the district, which also hosts some sport facilities, mainly football fields and a swimming pool.

The district is completed by the ''Cimitero Monumentale'' cemetery. This huge complex (formerly known as ''Cimitero Generale'') is the largest cemetery in Turin, and among the first in Italy for the number of buried people (over 400,000). It is close to the ''Colletta'' park. The ancient part of the cemetery rises from the main entrance of Corso Novara with his octagonal shape. It contains numerous historical tombs and 12&nbsp; km of arcades, enriched by artistic sculptures (that's why is called "monumental cemetery"). Over the years there have been subsequent extensions of the central historical body in the direction of the Colletta park. In the cemetery, there is a crematory temple built in 1882, the second largest in Italy after that of Milan one.

=== Main churches ===
[[File:Duomo Torino.jpg|thumb|left|[[Turin Cathedral]] featuring the [[Sindone Chapel|Chapel of the Holy Shroud]]]]
[[File:Basilica di superga.jpg|thumb|right|[[Basilica of Superga]]]]
{{See also|List of places of worship in Turin}}
The [[Santuario della Consolata]], a sanctuary much frequented by pilgrims, stands on the site of the 10th-century Monastery of St. Andrew, and is a work by Guarini. It was sumptuously restored in 1903. Outside the city are: the [[Basilica of Our Lady Help of Christians, Turin|Basilica of Our Lady, Help of Christians]] built by St. [[John Bosco]], the [[Gran Madre di Dio, Turin|Gran Madre]] built in 1818 on occasion of the return of King [[Victor Emmanuel I of Sardinia]] and [[Monte dei Cappuccini, Turin|Santa Maria del Monte]] (1583) on Monte dei Cappuccini.

In the hills overlooking the city, the [[Basilica of Superga]] provides a view of Turin against a backdrop of the snow-capped Alps. The basilica holds the tombs of many of the dukes of Savoy, as well as many of the kings of Sardinia. Superga can be reached by means of the [[Superga Rack Railway]] from Sassi suburb. The Basilica of Superga was built by [[Amadeus II of Savoy]] as an ex-voto for the liberation of Turin (1706), and served as a royal mausoleum since 1772.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Catholic_Encyclopedia_(1913)/Turin |title=Catholic Encyclopedia (1913)/Turin – Wikisource |publisher=En.wikisource.org |date=7 March 2007 |access-date=14 June 2010}}</ref>

=== Villas, parks and gardens ===

[[File:Borgomedievale sul PO.jpg|thumb|The medieval village in [[Parco del Valentino|Valentino Park]]]]
[[File:Area dei Laghi.jpg|thumb|[[La Mandria Regional Park]]]]

The most popular park in the city is [[Parco del Valentino]]. In 1961, during the celebrations of ''Italia61'' ([[Italian unification]] centenary), an important international exhibition (''FLOR61: Flowers of the world in Turin'') took place in the park with 800 exhibitors from 19 countries. For the occasion the plan for the new lighting of the park, along with its fountains and paths, was assigned to Guido Chiarelli, the head engineer at the city hall.

Other large parks are ''Parco della Pellerina'', ''Parco Colletta'', ''Parco Rignon'', ''Parco Colonnetti'' and the [[Orto Botanico dell'Università di Torino|University botanical gardens]]. Around the city are several other parks such as [[La Mandria Regional Park]] and the [[Parco naturale di Stupinigi|Parco della Palazzina di Caccia di Stupinigi]], once hunting grounds of the Savoy, and those on the hills of Turin. Many parks are smaller, in the various districts: there is also a total of 240 playgrounds in these parks. In the early 1960s, mayor [[Amedeo Peyron]] had the first garden in Italy with games for children inaugurated. According to a [[Legambiente]] report from 2007, Turin is the first Italian city as far as structures and policies on childcare are concerned.<ref>[http://www.legambientepiemonte.it/doc/05-01-07% 20com% 20St% 20ecosistema% 20bambino% 202007.pdf Ecosystem child. Report Legambiente |]{{Dead link|date=May 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> One of the most famous parks featuring a children's playground is ''Parco della Tesoriera'', which is also home to ''Andrea della Corte Municipal Music Library''; this facility is housed in [[Villa Tesoriera]], built in 1715 and once the Royal Treasurer's residence. The park is in the Parella suburb (Turin's West Side) and hosts many concerts in summer.

[[Rosa Vercellana]], commonly known as ''Rosina'' and, in [[Piedmontese language|Piedmontese]] as ''La Bela Rosin'' ("the beautiful Rosin"), was the [[Mistress (lover)|mistress]] and later wife of King [[Victor Emmanuel II of Italy|Victor Emmanuel II]]. She was made Countess of Mirafiori and Fontanafredda, but never Queen of Italy. As the Savoy family refused to allow her to be buried next to her husband in the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]], her children had a mausoleum built for her in a similar form and on a smaller scale in Turin, next to the road to the Castello di Mirafiori. The circular copper-domed [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] monument, surmounted by a [[Latin cross]] and surrounded by a large park, was designed by [[Angelo Dimezzi]] and completed in 1888.<ref>[http://www.piemontefeel.org/en/interesse/elemento-206.html ‘Mausoleo della Bela Rosin’], ''Piemontefeel'' (Regione Piemonte, 2005).</ref><ref name="parks">[http://www.parks.it/parco.po.to/pun.torinese.html ‘Parco fluviale del Po tratto torinese: Punti di Interesse’], Parks.it (Rome: Federazione Italiana Parchi e Riserve Natural).</ref>

In 2009, the city proper had a population of about 910,000, which is a significant increase on the 2001 census figure. This result is due to a growing immigration from [[Southern Italy]] and abroad. Approximately 13.5 per cent (122.946) of the population is composed of foreigners, the largest numbers coming from [[Romania]] (51,017), [[Morocco]] (22,511), [[Albania]] (9,165), China (5,483), and [[Moldova]] (3,417).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://demo.istat.it/str2006/index.html |title=Statistiche demografiche ISTAT |publisher=Demo.istat.it |date=|access-date=30 April 2009}}</ref> Like many Northern Italian cities, there is a large proportion of pensioners in comparison to youth.

{{Main|Economy of Turin}}

After it had been little more than a town for a long time, in 1559 the Duke [[Emmanuel Philibert, Duke of Savoy|Emmanuel Philibert]] of Savoy made Turin the capital of his domains. The Duke had the ambition to transform the city into a major artistic and cultural capital, and in the following centuries numerous artists were to work at the Savoy court, especially architects and planners like [[Carlo di Castellamonte]] and his son [[Amedeo Castellamonte|Amedeo]], [[Guarino Guarini]] and, in the 18th century, [[Filippo Juvarra]] and [[Benedetto Alfieri]].

As for the painting and the visual arts, Turin became a point of reference, especially in the 20th century. In the 1920s, the painter [[Felice Casorati (painter)|Felice Casorati]] inspired a number of students called [[The group of six of Turin]] and these included [[Carlo Levi]], [[Henry Paolucci]], [[Gigi Chessa]], [[Francis Menzio]], [[Nicola Galante]] and [[Jessie Boswell]].

=== Music ===

[[File:IB teatro regio.jpg|thumb|right|Teatro Regio opera house.]]

The city's main opera house is [[Teatro Regio di Torino]], where Puccini premiered his ''[[La Bohème]]'' in 1896. It burned down in 1936 and was rebuilt after WW II.

=== Literature ===
[[File:Biblioteca Nazionale di Torino.jpg|thumb|right|National Library.]]
A literary centre for many centuries, Turin began to attract writers only after the establishment of the court of the [[House of Savoy|Dukes of Savoy]]. One of the most famous writers of the 17th century was [[Giambattista Marino]], which in 1608 moved to the court of [[Charles Emmanuel I, Duke of Savoy|Charles Emmanuel I]]. Marino suffered an assassination attempt by a rival, [[Gaspare Murtola]], and was later imprisoned for a year because of gossip that he had said and written against the duke. Perhaps, because of this, in 1615 Marino left Turin and moved to France.

The main literary figures during the Baroque age in Turin were [[Emanuele Tesauro]] and [[Alessandro Tassoni]]. In the next century Torino hosted the poet [[Vittorio Alfieri]] from Asti for a while. The situation was very different in the 19th century, especially since the city became a point of reference for Italian unification and, subsequently, the capital of the Kingdom of Italy. Indeed, in those years Tommaseo, Settembrini and [[John Meadows (author)|John Meadows]] resided in the city. A major literary and cultural woman of that time was [[Olimpia Savio]]. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Turin was home to writers such as [[Guido Gozzano]], [[Edmondo De Amicis]], [[Emilio Salgari]] and Dino Segre, the latter known by the pseudonym of [[Pitigrilli]].

Turin had a very important role in Italian literature after World War II. A major publishing house, [[Giulio Einaudi]], publushed works by authors such as [[Cesare Pavese]], [[Italo Calvino]], [[Vitaliano Brancati]], [[Primo Levi]], [[Natalia Ginzburg]], [[Fernanda Pivano]], [[Beppe Fenoglio]], [[Carlo Fruttero]] and [[Franco Lucentini]]. In more recent years, writers active in the city are [[Giovanni Arpino]], [[Nico Orengo]], [[Giuseppe Culicchia]], [[Margherita Oggero]], [[Laura Mancinelli]], [[Alessandra Montrucchio]], [[Alessandro Perissinotto]], [[Guido Quartz]], [[Piero Soria]] and [[Alessandro Baricco]]. Baricco was also among the founders of the [[Scuola Holden]], dedicated to writing techniques teaching.

In the local [[Piedmontese language]] has a literary tradition, with names such as [[Nicoletto da Torino]], [[Ignas Isler]], author of epic poems, and [[Eduard Calv]].

=== Religion ===

The city is home to the well-known [[Shroud of Turin]]: a linen cloth bearing the image of a man who appears to have suffered physical trauma in a manner consistent with crucifixion. It is kept in the royal chapel of the Cathedral of Saint John the Baptist in the city centre. The shroud is one of the city's main symbols and tourist attractions, and despite historical and scientific evidence pointing to it being a 14th-century forgery, it is a symbol of [[Catholic devotion|religious devotion]].

In 1949, in the [[Superga air disaster]], a plane carrying almost the whole team crashed into the [[Basilica of Superga]] in the Turin hills.

=== Cinema ===
 [[File:Mole Antonelliana from Piazza Statuto.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|[[Mole Antonelliana]]]]
Turin is the Italian city where film [[History of chromatography|chromatography]] was first established. As such, it forms the birthplace of [[Italian cinema]]. Because of its historic, geographical and cultural proximity to France, Italian filmmakers were naturally influenced by [[Cinema of France|French cinema]] and the [[Auguste and Louis Lumière|Lumière brothers]]. The first Italian cinema screening occurred in Turin in March 1896. In November 1896, Italian filmmakers performed the first cinema screening of a film before a fee-paying audience.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cinemaniaci.it/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=38 |title="Le proiezioni cinematografiche a Torino" – di Pierluigi Capra |publisher=Cinemaniaci.it |date=|access-date=12 April 2011}}</ref>

By the start of the 20th century (especially after 1907), a number of the first Italian films were aired in Turin. Examples include [[Giovanni Pastrone]] ''[[Cabiria]]'', in 1914, one of the first [[blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbusters]] in history.

The Turin-based company [[Ambrosio Film]], established in 1906 by [[Arturo Ambrosio]], was one of the leading forces in Italian cinema and boosted the importance of the city as a filmmaking destination. The company, noted in particular for its historical epics, produced a large number of films until it was dissolved in 1924.

During the 1920s and 30s, Turin hosted a number of film productions and major film studios (''film houses''), such as the [[Itala film]], [[Aquila (studio)|Aquila]] and [[Fert Studios]]. Today their heritage is in the modern [[Lumiq Studios]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lumiq.com|title=Lumiq.com|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130115222940/http://www.lumiq.com/|archivedate=15 January 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref> and [[Virtual Reality Multi Media Spa]] <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vrmmp.it|title=Vrmmp – Notizie e guide online|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comune.torino.it/torinoplus/italiano/portrait/novecento.html |title=Torino nel Novecento, Torino |publisher=Comune.torino.it |date=|access-date=12 April 2011}}</ref> Turin's prominence in Italian film continued until 1937, the year [[Cinecittà]] was inaugurated in Rome.

After World War II, the cinematic scene in Turin continued to thrive. 1956 saw the opening of the [[National Museum of Cinema]], first housed in the [[Palazzo Chiablese]] and then, from 2000, in the imposing headquarters of the [[Mole Antonelliana]]. In 1982 the film critic [[Gianni Rondolino]] created Festival Internazionale Cinema Giovani,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.torinofilmfest.org/?action=history&id=1 |title=TFF |publisher=Torinofilmfest.org |date=25 September 1982 |access-date=16 August 2011}}</ref> which later became the [[Torino Film Festival]].

Today Turin is one of the main cinematographic and television centres in Italy, thanks to the role of the [[Turin Film Commission]] that reports the production of many feature films, soap operas and commercials.

Turin streets were the locations where [[Audrey Hepburn]] played ''[[War and Peace (1956 film)|War and Peace]]'', [[Michael Caine]] drove a Mini Cooper in ''[[The Italian Job]]'', [[Claudio Bisio]] becomes the president of the Italian Republic, [[Carlo Verdone]] set his version of ''[[Cinderella (2013 film)|Cinderella]]'', [[Marco Tullio Giordana]] shot ''[[Piazza Fontana: The Italian Conspiracy]]'', [[Woody Allen]] shot ''[[Hannah and Her Sisters]]'', [[Cate Blanchett]] played ''[[Heaven (2002 film)|Heaven]]'', [[Giovanna Mezzogiorno]] ''[[Vincere]]'', [[Marcello Mastroianni]] and [[Jacqueline Bisset]] ''[[The Sunday Woman (film)|The Sunday Woman]]'', and [[Harvey Keitel]] ''[[The Stone Merchant]]''. Turin also became the capital of the tsar for ''[[The Demons of St. Petersberg]]''.

Turin is well known for its chocolate production, especially for its traditional, ingot-shapetd chocolate called ''[[gianduiotto]]'', named after [[Gianduja (commedia dell'arte)|Gianduja]], a local [[commedia dell'arte]] mask. Moreover, the city is also known for the so-called ''[[bicerin]]'', a traditional hot drink made of [[espresso]], [[drinking chocolate]] and [[whole milk]] served layered in a small rounded glass. Every year Turin organizes ''CioccolaTÒ'', a two-week chocolate festival run with the main Piedmontese chocolate producers, such as [[Pierre Paul Caffarel|Caffarel]], Streglio, [[Venchi]] and others, as well as some big international companies, such as [[Lindt & Sprüngli]].

As for [[snack food]], the now popular [[Tramezzino|tramezzini]] were first served in a historic café of downtown Turin, namely ''Caffè Mulassano'', where they were devised in 1925 as an alternative to [[Cuisine of England|English]] [[tea sandwich]]es.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.lastampa.it/Torino/cmsSezioni/costume/200808rticoli/7805girata.asp |title=Il tramezzino è nato da Mulassano |newspaper=La Stampa |date=8 May 2008 |language=Italian}}{{dead link|date=February 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=http://lastampa.it/2013/11/04/societa/cucina/reportage/a-tavola/recensione/il-pranzo/qui-nato-il-tramezzino-e-si-sente-12q3K83mI7IQoam7Bsc44O/pagina.html |language=Italian |newspaper=La Stampa |title=Qui è nato il tramezzino e si sente |first=Rocco |last=Moliterni |date=11 April 2013 |access-date=8 February 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140502032031/http://lastampa.it/2013/11/04/societa/cucina/reportage/a-tavola/recensione/il-pranzo/qui-nato-il-tramezzino-e-si-sente-12q3K83mI7IQoam7Bsc44O/pagina.html |archive-date=2 May 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In recent years, another trademark drink of the city is ''MoleCola'', an Italian [[Coca-Cola]] that entered production in 2012 and quickly spread both in Italy and outside its native country.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://bevimolecola.it/la-storia/ |title=La Storia – Molecola |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |language=Italian |website=Bevimolecola.it |trans-title=History – Molecola |access-date=8 February 2016}}</ref>

Local cuisine also features a particular type of pizza, so-called ''[[Pizza#Italy|pizza al padellino]]'' or ''[[Pizza#Italy|pizza al tegamino]]'', which is basically a small-sized, thick-crust and deep-dish pizza typically served in several Turin pizza places.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.agrodolce.it/2014/04/03/torino-la-riscoperta-della-pizza-al-padellino/ |title=Torino: la riscoperta della pizza al padellino |publisher=Agrodolce |access-date=8 December 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gelapajo.it/pizza-al-padellino-che-cose/ |title=Pizza al padellino (o tegamino): che cos'è? |publisher=Gelapajo.it |access-date=8 December 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151210202900/http://www.gelapajo.it/pizza-al-padellino-che-cose/ |archivedate=10 December 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://torino.repubblica.it/cronaca/2013/01/19/news/beniamino_il_profeta_della_pizza_gourmet-50867170/?refresh_ce |title=Beniamino, il profeta della pizza gourmet |publisher=Torino – Repubblica.it |access-date=8 December 2015}}</ref>

Since the mid-1980s, Piedmont has also benefited from the start of the [[Slow Food]] movement and [[Terra Madre]], events that have highlighted the rich agricultural and vinicultural value of the [[Po Valley]] and [[northern Italy]].

[[File:Loggiato Università di Torino.jpg|right|235px|thumb|Hall of the Rectorate Palace of the University of Turin]]
Turin is home to one of Italy's oldest universities, the [[University of Turin]], including its affiliated [[Collegio Carlo Alberto]], which ranks among the best universities in the country. Another established university in the city is the [[Polytechnic University of Turin]], ranking among Top 50 universities in the world and #1 in Italy in the fields of engineering, technology and computer science ("Academic Ranking of World Universities" published by [[Shanghai Jiao Tong University]]). Turin also hosts the [[United Nations System Staff College]], the [[European Training Foundation]], and a campus of the [[ESCP Europe]] business school, ranked among the 10 best business schools in Europe. Moreover, the city hosts three small English language post-secondary institutions: [[St. John International University]], [[International University College of Turin]], and the [[Turin School of Development]], as well as [http://www.buddies.it/ Buddies Elementary School].

[[File:Torino PortaSusa galleria.jpg|thumb|left|[[Porta Susa]] railway station]]
The city currently has a large number of rail and road work sites. Although this activity has increased as a result of the [[2006 Winter Olympics]], parts of it had long been planned. Some of the work sites deal with general roadworks to improve traffic flow, such as underpasses and flyovers, but two projects are of major importance and will radically change the shape of the city.

One is the ''Spina Centrale'' ("Central Spine") project which includes the doubling of a major railway crossing the city, the [[Turin-Milan railway]] locally known as ''Passante Ferroviario di Torino'' ("Turin Railway Bypass"). The railroad previously ran in a trench, which will now be covered by a major boulevard running from North to South of Turin, in a central position along the city. [[Torino Porta Susa railway station|Porta Susa]], on this section, will become Turin's main station to substitute the terminus of [[Torino Porta Nuova railway station|Porta Nuova]] with a through station. Other important stations are [[Torino Stura railway station|Stura]], [[Torino Rebaudengo Fossata railway station|Rebaudengo]], [[Torino Lingotto railway station|Lingotto]] and [[Madonna di Campagna]] railway stations, though not all of them belong to the layout of the Spina Centrale.

[[File:MetroTorinoMassaua.jpg|thumb|right|Turin [[Massaua (Turin Metro)|Massaua]] metro station]]

The other major project is the construction of a subway line based on the [[Véhicule Automatique Léger|VAL]] system, known as [[Turin Metro|Metrotorino]]. This project is expected to continue for years and to cover a larger part of the city, but its first phase was finished in time for the [[2006 Winter Olympics|2006 Olympic Games]], inaugurated on 4 February 2006 and opened to the public the day after. The first leg of the subway system linked the nearby town of [[Collegno]] with Porta Susa in Turin's city centre. On 4 October 2007, the line was extended to Porta Nuova and then, in March 2011, to Lingotto. A new extension of the so-called ''Linea 1'' ("Line 1") is expected in the near future, reaching both [[Rivoli, Piedmont|Rivoli]] (up to Cascine Vica hamlet) in the Western belt of Turin and ''Piazza Bengasi'' in the Southeast side of the city. Furthermore, a ''Linea 2'' is in the pipeline that will connect the south-western district of Mirafiori with Barriera di Milano in the north end. In June 2018, the project entered the public consultation phase with the proposed list of 23 stations published on the city's website.<ref>{{cite web|title=M2TO Progetto Premliminare della Linea 2|url=http://www.comune.torino.it/trasporti/bm%7Edoc/180626_ppt_invio.pdf|publisher=Citta di Torino|access-date=17 July 2018}}</ref>

The main street in the city centre, ''Via Roma'', runs atop a tunnel built during the fascist era (when ''Via Roma'' itself was totally refurbished and took on its present-day aspect). The tunnel was supposed to host the underground line but it is now used as an underground car park. A project to build an underground system was ready in the 1970s, with government funding for it and for similar projects in [[Milan]] and Rome. Whilst the other two cities went ahead with the projects, Turin's local government led by mayor Diego Novelli shelved the proposal as it believed it to be too costly and unnecessary.

The city has an international airport known as [[Turin Caselle Airport|Caselle International Airport]] [[Sandro Pertini]] (airport code: TRN), in [[Caselle Torinese]], about {{convert|13|km|0|abbr=on}} from Turin's centre &ndash; connected to the city by rail (from Dora Station) and bus (from Porta Nuova and Porta Susa railway stations).

{{As of|2010}} a [[bicycle sharing system]], the [[ToBike]], is operational.

The metropolitan area is served by [[Turin metropolitan railway service]].

Central districts are served by [[Trams in Turin|tram]], lines 3,4,9 are light-rail.
