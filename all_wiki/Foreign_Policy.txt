'''''Foreign Policy''''' is an American news publication, founded in 1970 and focused on global affairs, current events, and domestic and international policy. It produces content daily on its website,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/|title=Foreign Policy – the Global Magazine of News and Ideas|first=Ola|last=Salem}}</ref> and in six print issues annually.

''Foreign Policy'' magazine and ForeignPolicy.com are published by The FP Group,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://fpgroup.foreignpolicy.com/|title=Foreign Policy Group|website=fpgroup.foreignpolicy.com}}</ref> a division of [[Graham Holdings Company]] (formerly The [[Washington Post]] Company). The FP Group also produces FP Events, ''Foreign Policy'''s events division, launched in 2012.

== History ==
''Foreign Policy'' was founded in late 1970 by [[Samuel P. Huntington]], professor of [[Harvard University]], and his friend [[Warren Demian Manshel]] to give a voice to alternative views about American foreign policy at the time of the [[Vietnam War]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Samuel Huntington, 1927-2008 |url= https://foreignpolicy.com/articles/2009/02/16/samuel_huntington_1927_2008 |access-date=13 September 2014 |newspaper= Foreign Policy |date=16 February 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=100 Years of Impact: A Timeline of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace |url= http://carnegieendowment.org/about/timeline100/index.html |access-date=22 April 2015 |newspaper=Carnegie Endowment for International Peace}}</ref> Huntington hoped it would be "serious but not scholarly, lively but not glib".<ref name="Samuel Huntington, 1927-2008">{{cite news |last=Yester |first=Katherine |title=Samuel Huntington, 1927-2008 |url= https://foreignpolicy.com/articles/2009/02/16/samuel_huntington_1927_2008 |access-date=13 September 2014 |newspaper= Foreign Policy |date=16 February 2009}}</ref>

In early 1978, after six years of close partnership, the [[Carnegie Endowment for International Peace]] acquired full ownership of ''Foreign Policy''. In 2000, a format change was implemented from a slim quarterly academic journal to a bimonthly magazine. It also launched international editions in [[Europe]], [[Africa]], the [[Middle East]], [[Asia]] and [[Latin America]].

In September 2008, ''Foreign Policy'' was bought by The Washington Post Company (now [[Graham Holdings Company]]).<ref name="FP purchased by WaPo">{{cite news |last=Ahrens |first=Frank |title= Post Co.

== Style ==
According to its submissions guidelines, ''Foreign Policy'' articles "strike the balance" between informed specialist research and general readability, and tend to be written in plain rather than "wonky" language.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://foreignpolicy.submittable.com/submit|title= Submissions|author=<!--Not stated--> |website= Foreign Policy|access-date= 28 November 2018}}</ref>

== Editorial stance ==
''Foreign Policy'' endorsed Democratic candidate [[Hillary Clinton]] in the [[2016 US presidential election]]. This was the first time in its 50-year history the magazine endorsed a candidate.<ref name="foreign">{{cite news |url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2016/10/09/foreign-policy-endorses-hillary-clinton-for-president-of-the-united-states/ |title=Hillary Clinton for President of the United States |date=October 9, 2016}}</ref>

== Awards ==
Since 2003, ''Foreign Policy'' has been nominated for eight [[National Magazine Awards]], winning six: three for its print publication and three for its digital publication at ForeignPolicy.com. ''FP'' is the only independent magazine that has won consecutive digital national magazine awards every year from being established in 2009.{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}
