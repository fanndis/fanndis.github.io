The BBC News 100 Women list in 2015 was made up of many notable international names,<ref name=BBCNews-100Women-2015>{{cite news|title=BBC 100 Women 2015: Who is on the list?|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-34745739|work=[[BBC News]]|date=17 November 2015}}</ref> as well as women who were unknown, but who represented issues women face.  The women of 2015, were from 51 countries and were not necessarily those who would traditionally have been seen as role models—a woman suffering from depression, a woman who advocates for equal access to bathroom facilities, a woman who encourages other women to avoid make-up, and a reindeer nomad.<ref>{{cite news|last1=معتمدی|first1=کامران|title=اشتغال، رهایی و پیامبران جدید سرمایه|url=http://www.radiozamaneh.com/257993|accessdate=6 December 2016|publisher=رادیو زمانه|date=11 February 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160502014946/http://www.radiozamaneh.com/257993|archivedate=2 May 2016|location=Amsterdam, The Netherlands|language=Persian|trans-title=Employment, freedom and new capital messenger}}</ref>
