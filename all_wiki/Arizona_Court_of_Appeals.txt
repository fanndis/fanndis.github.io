The '''Arizona Court of Appeals''' is the intermediate [[appellate court]] for the state of [[Arizona]]. It is divided into two divisions, with a total of twenty-two [[judge]]s on the court: sixteen in Division One, based in [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], and six in Division Two, based in [[Tucson, Arizona|Tucson]].

==Jurisdiction==
The Court of Appeals has [[jurisdiction]] to consider appeals in [[Civil law (common law)|civil cases]] from the [[Arizona Superior Court]].  The court also reviews [[Minor (law)|juvenile]] and [[Family law|domestic relations]] matters from the superior court, [[workers’ compensation]] and [[unemployment benefits]] decisions, [[Arizona Superior Court|tax court]] decisions, and certain corporation commission decisions.

The court also has jurisdiction over appeals in [[Criminal law|criminal matters]] from superior court, except for cases in which a [[Capital punishment|death sentence]] has been imposed.  Death penalty cases go directly to the [[Supreme Court of Arizona]].

The court may also decide "petitions for special action," which is Arizona's term for petitions for special [[writ]]s, such as [[certiorari]], [[mandamus]] and [[Prohibition (writ)|prohibition]].

==Procedures==
===Selection of judges===
Judges are selected by a modified form of the [[Missouri Plan]].  A bipartisan commission considers applicants and sends a list of nominees to the governor.  The [[Governor of Arizona|governor]] is required by law to appoint from this list based on merit, without regard to party affiliation.  Judges are then retained for an initial period, after which they are subject to a [[retention election]].   If the judge wins the election, his/her term is six years.

===Deciding cases===
The Court of Appeals decides cases in panels of three judges, called "departments." Each department chooses a presiding judge from among the three. Division One also has a Chief Judge and Vice Chief Judge, elected by all judges in the division.

The process for pro se criminal defendants begins with the dismissal of a Petition for Post Conviction Relief by the superior court. A review of the superior court's decision by the court of appeals begins with a Petition for Review.

===Divisions===
While the Court of Appeals is divided into two geographic divisions in Phoenix and Tucson, the superior courts are bound by all of the Court of Appeals decisions, regardless of the division they are issued in. An Arizona trial court is not required to give greater precedent to a Court of Appeals decision from the division it is located in then a decision from the other division.<ref>''State v. Patterson'', 218 P.3d 1031, 1037 (Ariz. App. 2009)</ref>
*Division 1 consists of Maricopa, Yuma, La Paz, Mohave, Coconino, Yavapai, Navajo and Apache counties.
*Division 2 consists of Pima, Pinal, Cochise, Santa Cruz, Greenlee, Graham and Gila counties.<ref>A.R.S. § 12-120</ref>
At least ten judges of Division One must be residents of Maricopa county and five residents of the remaining counties. One may be from any county. 
At least four judges of Division Two must be residents of Pima county and two residents of the remaining counties.<ref>A.R.S. § 12-120.02</ref>

Division One has statewide responsibility for appeals from the Industrial Commission and unemployment compensation rulings of the [[Arizona Department of Economic Security|Department of Economic Security]].<ref>https://www.azcourts.gov/AZ-Courts/Court-of-Appeals</ref> One department of Division One is responsible for appeals from the Tax Court.<ref>A.R.S. § 12-170</ref>
