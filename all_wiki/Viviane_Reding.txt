She is a member of the [[Christian Social People's Party]], part of the [[European People's Party]]. She previously served as [[European Commissioner for Education, Culture, Multilingualism and Youth|European Commissioner for Education and Culture]] from 1999 to 2004, [[European Commissioner for Digital Agenda|European Commissioner for Information Society and Media]] from 2004 to 2010 and [[European Commissioner for Justice, Fundamental Rights and Citizenship]] from 2010 to 2014.

Before starting a professional career as a journalist for the leading newspaper in Luxembourg, the ''[[Luxemburger Wort]]'', she obtained a doctorate in [[human sciences]] at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]].

On 27 November 2009, she was elevated in the "Barroso II Commission" to Vice-President responsible for Justice, Fundamental Rights and Citizenship.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8378401.stm "Barroso gets new EU Commission team"], BBC News, 25 November 2009.

==Political career==
[[File:Women in Economic Decision-making Viviane Reding (8414040954).jpg|thumb|Reding during the [[World Economic Forum|WEF]] 2013]]

===Role in Luxembourg politics===
Reding started her political career in 1979 as a Member of the Luxembourg Parliament and held the following positions:
* President of social committee
* Member of the Office of the Chamber of Deputies
* Member of the [[Benelux Parliament]]
* Member of the [[North Atlantic Assembly]] (leader of Christian Democrat/Conservative group)

From 1981 to 1999, she was Communal conciliator of the city of [[Esch-sur-Alzette|Esch]], in which she was President of the Cultural Affairs Committee from 1992 to 1999.

From 1988 to 1993, she was national president of the Christian-Social Women and from 1995 to 1999 and president of the [[Christian Social People's Party]].

===Member of the European Parliament, 1989–1999===
Reding served as the leader of Luxembourg's [[European People's Party|EPP]] delegation in the [[European Parliament]] from 1989 to 1999 and she was a Member of the group's Bureau.

Within the European Parliament, she held positions as chairwoman of the [[European Parliament Committee on Petitions|Committee on Petitions]] for 3 years, and Vice-Chair of the [[European Parliament Committee on Employment and Social Affairs|Committee on Employment and Social Affairs]] and the [[European Parliament Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs|Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs]] for 2 years each.

===European Commissioner for Education, Culture, Youth, Media and Sport, 1999–2004===
From 1999 to 2004, Reding was appointed Commissioner for Education, Culture, Youth, Media and Sport.

In her first term as European Commissioner Viviane Reding pushed through the [[Erasmus Mundus]] expanding the co-operation between universities and university students of the European Union and the rest of the world. Among other achievements she has also played a key role in strengthening the [[Culture 2000]] programme and the [http://ec.europa.eu/culture/media/index_en.htm EU MEDIA programme.]<ref>(Press Release) [http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=IP/03/549&format=HTML&aged=1&language=EN&guiLanguage=en The Commission proposes extending the Culture 2000 and MEDIA programmes up to 2006]. Europa (web portal).</ref>

===European Commissioner for Information Society and Media, 2004–2010===
In 2004 Reding became Commissioner for Information Society and Media.

While serving in the [[European Commission]] under [[Barroso Commission|President Barroso]], Reding found a relatively popular policy in lowering [[roaming]] charges of mobile phones when travelling within the European Union, stating: "For years, mobile roaming charges have remained unjustifiably high. We are therefore tackling one the last borders within Europe's internal market".<ref>[http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/activities/roaming/index_en.htm Roaming Charges Portal] European Commission.</ref> Her [[Regulation on roaming charges in the European Union|legislation to cap roaming charges]] was approved by the [[European Parliament|Parliament]] in April 2007.<ref>[http://www.computerbusinessreview.com/article_news.asp?guid=9D3AEC6B-EC7C-4114-965C-880A63EEFCDD European parliament backs roaming price cuts] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20070928080017/http://www.computerbusinessreview.com/article_news.asp?guid=9D3AEC6B-EC7C-4114-965C-880A63EEFCDD |date=28 September 2007 }} Computer Business Review Online.</ref>

On 7 April 2006 the Commission launched the new "[[.eu]]" [[Top-level domain|TLD]] for websites for EU companies and citizens wishing to have a non-national European internet address. This has proven popular with 2.5&nbsp;million being registered by April 2007. It is now the seventh most popular TLD worldwide, and third in Europe (after [[.de]] and [[.uk]]).<ref>[https://www.huffingtonpost.com/huff-wires/20070411/techbit-eu-internet-names .eu Domain Names Top 2.5M in ucatYear One] ''[[Huffington Post]]''.</ref>

In an unsuccessful bid to centralize regulatory oversight, Reding proposed in 2007 that the [[European Union Agency for Network and Information Security]] (ENISA) be folded into a new European Electronic Communications Market Authority (EECMA).<ref>Lorraine Mallinder (May 14, 2008), [http://www.politico.eu/article/enisa-an-agency-fighting-for-its-survival/ Enisa – an agency fighting for its survival] ''[[European Voice]]''.</ref>

Reding also promoted the use of the 112, the [[Emergency telephone number|Single European Emergency Number]] following the [[Universal Service Directive|European Union Directive 2002/22/EC]].<ref>(Press Release) [http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_SPEECH-05-596_en.htm?locale=en Viviane Reding Member of the European Commission responsible for Information Society and Media 112, the Single European Emergency Number : the need for action Conference on the Single European Emergency No. 112Brussels, 11 October 2005]. Europa.eu (2 May 2013).</ref>

Reding also proposed that major European [[List of telephone operating companies|telecom companies]] be forced to separate their network and service operations to promote competition in the market. The companies, including [[France Telecom]] and [[Deutsche Telekom]], would still own their networks but the separate management structure would be obliged to treat other operators on an equal basis in offering access to the network. This is opposed to separate ideas to force a full break-up of such companies.<ref>[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/40c4527a-dd91-11db-8d42-000b5df10621,dwp_uuid=70662e7c-3027-11da-ba9f-00000e2511c8,_i_rssPage=70662e7c-3027-11da-ba9f-00000e2511c8.html EU Commissioner favours /elecoms break-up]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} ''Financial Times''.</ref>

In 2008 the [[European Parliament]] voted to pass the "[[Telecoms Package]]", which would render the entire market a region into one market, making it easier to sell internet and phone services in EU, with the goal of making the telecom prices cheaper for customers in European Union. Among the many amendments to the proposal, amendment 138 was voted in favour with 574 votes for, and 73 against. This particular amendment requires any termination of internet subscription to be heard in front of a judge. Reding is known as an advocate for an [[Net neutrality|open Internet]], resisting attempts in 2010 by her colleague, Swedish EU Commissioner [[Cecilia Malmström]], to block access to websites.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://christianengstrom.wordpress.com/2010/05/01/net-censorship-debate-with-eu-commissioner-malmstrom/%20.|title=Debate between MEP Christian Engstrom and Commissioner Cecilia Malmström over her attempts to promote blocking access to the Internet}}</ref> In 2012 she disputed with [[European Commissioner for Trade|EU Trade Commissioner]] [[Karel De Gucht]] 2012 over the [[Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement]] (ACTA).<ref>[http://www.iptegrity.com/index.php/acta/746-reding-handbags-degucht-over-ecj-referral discussion]. Iptegrity.com (23 February 2012).</ref> She favoured that amendment leading to the defeat of three-strikes policies such as those promoted by France's [[Hadopi law]].

===Vice-President of the European Commission, 2010–2014===
In June 2009, Reding was elected Member of the European Parliament, heading the list of the [[Christian Social People's Party]].<ref>[http://www.elections.public.lu/fr/elections-europeennes/2009/resultats_officiels/recensement_general.pdf Election pour la Chambre des]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.

On 9 February 2010, Reding was confirmed in her third term as European Commissioner becoming Vice-President and Commissioner responsible for Justice, Fundamental Rights and Citizenship.<ref>[http://www.ocmc.eu/english/news/new-commission-takes-office/ European Commission 2010–2014 confirmed] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720165846/http://www.ocmc.eu/english/news/new-commission-takes-office/ |date=20 July 2011 }}</ref> She was also given responsibility for the Commission's [[Directorate-General Communication|Directorate-General for Communication]].<ref>Simon Taylor (November 27, 2009), [http://www.politico.eu/article/commission-portfolios-re-shaped/ Commission portfolios re-shaped] ''[[European Voice]]''.</ref> In May 2010, Reding succeeded in having the original Directorate for Justice, Freedom and Security split in two, with the resulting [[Directorate-General for Justice and Consumers|Directorate-General for Justice]] – responsible for civil and criminal justice, fundamental rights, and citizenship – subsequently being added to her portfolio.<ref>Simon Taylor (May 26, 2010), [http://www.politico.eu/article/reding-gets-her-way-as-justice-department-splits-in-two/ Reding gets her way as justice department splits in two] ''[[European Voice]]''.</ref>

In addition, Reding also pushed for strengthing the EU's commitment to equality between women and men<ref>[http://ec.europa.eu/commission_2010-2014/president/news/documents/2010/03/20100305_2_en.htm President José Manuel Barroso – Women's Charter: Barroso's commitment to gender equality].

This proposal has generated a vocal debate across Europe with disparate groups of stakeholders in favour and against. In response to the specific opposition by a group of only male Ambassadors or Permanent Representative of European Union Member States Reding stated that "thankfully, European laws on important topics like this are not made by nine men in dark suits behind closed doors, but rather in a democratic process”.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/18/business/global/18iht-boards18.html?_r=0 | work=The New York Times | first=Stephen | last=Castle | title=European Plan to Put More Women on Boards Runs Into Opposition | date=17 September 2012}}</ref> After a long discussion in the [[European Commission]] Mrs Reding's ideas, shared, among others, by the President of the European Commission José Manuel Durão Barroso and the Commissioners with economic portfolios ([[Joaquín Almunia]], [[Antonio Tajani]], [[Olli Rehn]], [[Michel Barnier]] and [[Laszlo Andor]]) prevailed over the views of fellow Commissioners such as [[Neelie Kroes]], [[Catherine Ashton]], [[Cecilia Malmström]] and [[Janusz Lewandowski]] and a proposal for a Directive was adopted on 14 November 2012.<ref>(Press Release) [http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-12-1205_en.htm Women on Boards: Commission proposes 40% objective].

She also pushed measures to improve the rights of people with disabilities across Europe<ref>http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2010:0636:FIN:EN:PDF</ref> by eradicating discrimination on the grounds of disability and eliminating the barriers faced by Europeans with disabilities whenever accessing goods and services.

On 7 July 2010, Reding had an official meeting with the Secretary General of the [[Council of Europe]], [[Thorbjørn Jagland]], to launch joint talks on the EU's accession to the [[European Convention on Human Rights]].<ref>[http://www.hrea.org/index.php?base_id=2&language_id=1&headline_id=11632 European Commission and Council of Europe kick off joint talks on EU's accession to the Convention on Human Rights], hrea.org.</ref> On that occasion, she was assaulted by a man with mental health problems in front of the [[Palace of Europe]].<ref>[http://sitemap.dna.fr/articles/201007/10/viviane-reding-agressee,international,000005347.php ''Viviane Reding agressée''], [[Les Dernières Nouvelles d'Alsace]] {{in lang|fr}}.</ref>

In April 2012 Reding declined an invitation by [[UEFA]] President [[Michel Platini]] to attend the [[UEFA Euro 2012]] championships citing "institutional reasons". She used the opportunity to invite UEFA "to take account of the dramatic situation of [[Yulia Tymoshenko]]" stressing that Europeans "cannot close their eyes on human rights even during a great sporting celebration".<ref>[http://www.eubusiness.com/news-eu/ukraine-politics.g8f/ UEFA 'can't close eyes' on Tymoshenko situation: EU — EUbusiness – European Union news for business].

In December 2012, in an interview to the ''[[Daily Telegraph]]''<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/eu/9769526/David-Cameron-plan-to-opt-out-of-EU-policing-laws-will-allow-criminals-to-run-free.html David Cameron plan to opt out of EU policing laws 'will allow criminals to run free']. ''The Daily Telegraph''.</ref> Reding dubbed as "crazy" the plans of United Kingdom Prime Minister [[David Cameron]] to opt out from EU co-operation mechanisms such as [[Europol]], [[Eurojust]] and the [[European Arrest Warrant]].

In June 2013 at a citizens dialogue in Esch-sur-Alzette Reding commented on the revelations of mass-scale spying by the US [[National Security Agency]] on Europeans stating that "partners do not spy on each other",<ref>{{cite web|author=By LARA JAKES The Associated Press |url=http://www.pressherald.com/news/nationworld/partners-do-not-spy-on-each-other_2013-07-01.html?pagenum=full |title=EU official: 'Partners do not spy on each other' - Portland Press Herald |publisher=Pressherald.com |date=2013-07-01 |accessdate=2017-06-28}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Published on Monday, 1 July 2013 at 08:27 |url=http://www.wort.lu/en/view/partners-do-not-spy-on-each-other-says-viviane-reding-51d11525e4b0ab8886782206 |title=Luxemburger Wort - "Partners do not spy on each other!" says Viviane Reding |publisher=Wort.lu |date=2013-07-01 |accessdate=2017-06-28}}</ref> stressing that such behaviour by the US Administration risks undermining trade talks with the European Union.

In July 2013 Reding sympathised with the protesters in [[Sofia]], [[Bulgaria]], who called in the streets for an oligarch-free government. She has also called for political unity and consensus in Bulgaria.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_SPEECH-13-655_en.htm |title=European Commission - PRESS RELEASES - Press release - Speech: Main Messages: Citizens' Dialogue in Sofia |publisher=Europa.eu |date= |accessdate=2017-06-28}}</ref>

Also in July 2013 Reding called on the government of [[Croatia]] to change its law. The [[Constitution of Croatia]] claimed that "A citizen of the Republic of Croatia cannot be exiled from the Republic of Croatia nor have his citizenship revoked, nor can he be extradited to another country.", which was changed in 2010., now saying "A citizen of the Republic of Croatia cannot be exiled from the Republic of Croatia nor have his citizenship revoked, nor can he be extradited to another country, unless a decision of extradition has to be made in accordance to the international contract(s) or [[Community acquis|EU acquis]]." ''Zakon o pravosudnoj suradnji u kaznenim stvarima s državama članicama Europske unije'' (ZoPSEU) (eng. The law of Judicial Cooperation in Criminal Matters with the Member States of the European Union) came into effect on 1 July 2013., the date Croatia became an EU member. As Croatia became a full-fledged EU member, European Arrest Warrants were sent to the addresses of Croatian judiciary institutions, a total of 84 warrants by 2 July 2013. at 10 AM. Although the warrants included the warrant for [[Josip Perković]], the police did not detain him, as the felony he is charged with took place before 2002., and by the same criteria, 19 other warrants will not be considered. Viviane Reding urged the Croatian government to change this, as the media dubbed the problematic law "Lex Perković", and Mrs Reding threatened with diplomatic sanctions against Croatia. However, as Croatia wishes to be on par with other EU members, and in France the European Arrest Warrant is applied to felonies committed after 1 November 1993., and in Austria, Italy and Luxembourg after 7 August 2002., there seems to be no reason Croatia should abolish its 2002. rule, since a legal precedent in other EU member states exists.<ref>{{cite web|author=Foto: Anto Magzan/Pixsell |url=http://www.vecernji.hr/vijesti/hrvatska-zbog-perkovica-mijenja-zakon-ekstradiciji-clanak-570793 |title=Hrvatska zbog Perkovića mijenja Zakon o ekstradiciji - Večernji.hr |publisher=Vecernji.hr |date= |accessdate=2017-06-28}}</ref>

In January 2014, Reding publicly announced that she has no plans to seek the nomination of the centre-right European People's Party for the presidency of the European Commission and that she supports the candidacy of fellow centre-right Luxembourger [[Jean-Claude Juncker]].<ref>Toby Vogel (January 28, 2014), [http://www.politico.eu/article/reding-says-she-does-not-want-to-be-commission-president/ Reding says she does not want to be Commission president] ''[[European Voice]]''.</ref> [[Johannes Hahn]] twice served as Acting Commissioner in her stead, from 19 April 2014 – 25 May 2014 while she was on electoral campaign leave for the [[2014 European Parliament election in Luxembourg|2014 elections]] to the [[European Parliament]], and 1 July 2014 – 16 July 2014 after she took up her seat.<ref>{{cite web|author=Wednesday 28th Jun 2017 |url=http://euobserver.com/news/123733 |title=EU Observer – Six Commissioners Head for EU Election Campaign Trail |publisher=Euobserver.com |date=2017-06-20 |accessdate=2017-06-28}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kuna.net.kw/ArticleDetails.aspx?id=2385629&language=en |title=KUNA – Barroso announces caretaker replacements following resignation of 4 EU Commissioners |publisher=Kuna.net.kw |date= |accessdate=2017-06-28}}</ref>

===''Future of Europe'' initiative, 2012===
In February 2012 Reding challenged her fellow European leaders to start working towards designing the future of the united European continent.

As part of the European debate on the Future of Europe Reding initiated in late 2012 a series of Citizens Dialogues<ref>[http://ec.europa.eu/european-debate/index_en.htm Debate on the future of Europe – European Commission]. European Commission.</ref> bringing European politicians into town-hall meetings with European citizens.

===Member of the European Parliament, 2014–2018===
Following the [[2014 European Parliament election in Belgium|2014 European elections]], Reding put herself forward as a candidate to be a [[Vice President of the European Parliament|Vice-President of the European Parliament]]. However she came in last in an internal vote to select the [[European People's Party Group]] candidates.<ref>Dave Keating (July 1, 2014), [http://www.politico.eu/article/european-parliament-elects-vice-presidents/ European Parliament elects vice-presidents] ''[[European Voice]]''.</ref> She subsequently failed in her bid to become the EPP's candidate to chair the [[European Parliament Committee on Legal Affairs|Committee on Legal Affairs]].<ref>Simon Taylor (July 7, 2014), [http://www.politico.eu/article/reding-loses-legal-affairs-chair-to-czech-epp-mep/ Reding to miss out on chair of legal affairs committee] ''[[European Voice]]''.</ref>

Reding currently serves as a member of the [[Committee on International Trade]]. In addition to her committee assignments, Reding is a member of the European Parliament Intergroup on Long Term Investment and Reindustrialisation<ref>[http://longterminvestment.eu/members Members] European Parliament Intergroup on Long Term Investment and Reindustrialisation.</ref> and the European Parliament Intergroup on the Digital Agenda.<ref>[https://digitalagendaintergroup.eu/members/ Members] European Parliament Intergroup on the Digital Agenda.</ref>

==Controversies==

===Controversy over Roma===
{{main|French Roma repatriation}}
After the leak of a French Interior Ministry circular of 5 August 2010, Reding made a public statement that was interpreted as likening the [[French Roma repatriation|2010 French deportations of the Roma]] to those made from France by the occupying German forces during World War II: "I personally have been appalled by a situation which gave the impression that people are being removed from a Member State of the European Union just because they belong to a certain ethnic minority. This is a situation I had thought Europe would not have to witness again after the Second World War".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eubusiness.com/news-eu/france-immigration.642 |title=EU threatens France with legal action over Roma 'disgrace' |publisher=Eubusiness.com |date=14 September 2010 |accessdate=18 September 2010}}</ref>

For a while, the French government's claim that it was expelling people on legal rather than ethnic grounds was claimed to be "openly contradicted by an administrative circular issue by the same government" mentioning the illegal Romani camps specifically ("en priorité ceux des Roms").<ref>See original circular pdf at: http://www.lecanardsocial.com/upload/IllustrationsLibres/Circulaire_du_5août_2010.pdf</ref> This mention could be explained by the fact that [[Romani people|Romani]] account for the overwhelming majority of foreign migrants setting up camps in France, and that "most Roma from the two countries [Bulgaria and Romania] are thought to be in France illegally".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-11027288 |title=Q&A: France Roma expulsions |publisher=BBC  |date=14 September 2010 |accessdate=18 September 2010}}</ref> The then French President [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] stated that his government had been unaware of the directive in question signed by Mr Michel Bart, the Chief of Staff of the French Minister of the Interior,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.leparisien.fr/politique/michel-bart-de-chevenement-a-hortefeux-14-09-2010-1067341.php|title=Michel Bart – Directeur du Cabinet du Ministre de l'intérieur}}</ref> and that the directive had been cancelled as soon as the government became aware of it through press reports. He stated that France continues to welcome refugees and that "we refuse the creation of slums... that are unworthy of French Republic or European ideals." President Sarkozy also stated that 80% of people removed from the camps during August 2010 were of French "gens du voyage", i.e. most of the campers thus removed were not foreign citizens or Roma; and that all removals were done based on judicial decisions, i.e. they were not unilateral police operations as would be based on a circular directive.<ref>{{cite web|work=Le Figaro |url=http://www.lefigaro.fr/politique/2010/09/16/01002-20100916ARTFIG00611-roms-a-bruxelles-sarkozy-maintient-son-cap.php |title=Roms : à Bruxelles, Sarkozy maintient son cap |location=France |accessdate=18 September 2010}}</ref>

The French government further stated that Reding had made an "unseemly blunder" and defended France as "the mother of human rights." Mr Sarkozy denounced Reding's comments as "scandalous" and stated that "if Luxembourg wants to take in Roma, that is no problem" as far as France is concerned.<ref name="lefigaro1">{{cite web|work=Le Figaro |url=http://www.lefigaro.fr/international/2010/09/15/01003-20100915ARTFIG00429-roms-l-elysee-fustige-les-critiques-de-bruxelles.php |title=Roms : l'Élysée fustige les critiques de Bruxelles |location=France |accessdate=18 September 2010}}</ref> This statement was based on Luxembourg's own rejection of migrants, yet Luxembourg's Minister for Foreign Affairs, [[Jean Asselborn]], deemed it "malevolent".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/luxembourg/8005614/Sarkozy-suggests-Roma-should-be-sent-to-Luxembourg.html |title=Sarkozy suggests Roma 'should be sent to Luxembourg'  |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=16 September 2010 |accessdate=24 July 2016}}</ref> President Sarkozy pointed out that Mrs Reding had been silent during larger-scale expulsions by other countries in earlier years, including by Italy specifically of its Roma during 2009 and when police reject Romani travellers trying to enter Luxembourg. French Immigration Minister [[Eric Besson]] said that in her statement Reding "intentionally skids, if I may say, that is she uses an expression aimed to shock, that contains an anachronistic fallacy, and that creates a false amalgam".<ref name="lefigaro1"/>

While some media coverage and opinion leaders supported her actions, others called for her immediate resignation.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=publico.pt |url=http://www.publico.pt/Mundo/primeiro-cigano-a-participar-em-aniversario-de-auschwitz-denuncia-condicoes-indignas_1477332 |title=Holocaust survivor denounces Roma expulsions |accessdate=9 March 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110201043641/http://www.publico.pt/Mundo/primeiro-cigano-a-participar-em-aniversario-de-auschwitz-denuncia-condicoes-indignas_1477332 |archivedate=1 February 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref name="spiegel1">{{cite news|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,717643,00.html|title=France Has Acted Systematically against an Entire People|accessdate=17 September 2010|date=15 September 2010|first=Michael Scott|last=Moore|newspaper=Der Spiegel }}</ref>

Following her initial statement, and intense discussions in the European Council and in the European Parliament, Mrs Reding announced that the European Commission intended to sue France at the European Court of Justice within two weeks. At the instigation of Mrs Reding, the European Commission later set up a Roma task force to analyse to what extent measures were being effectively taken to help the social and economic integration of Roma in Europe.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.morespect.eu/en2/2010/09/a-roma-task-force-to-monitorate-members-state-use-of-eu-funds/|title=Roma Task Force|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720164904/http://www.morespect.eu/en2/2010/09/a-roma-task-force-to-monitorate-members-state-use-of-eu-funds/|archivedate=20 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Mrs Reding subsequently privately recanted the historical comparison in her initial statement.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lefigaro.fr/international/2010/09/15/01003-20100915ARTFIG00701-viviane-reding-la-dame-en-rouge-qui-defie-la-france.php |work=Le Figaro |title=Viviane Reding, la dame en rouge qui défie la France |location=France |accessdate=18 September 2010}}</ref> Her office apologised for the analogy.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/17/world/europe/17union.html |title=Dispute Grows Over France's Removal of Roma Camps |newspaper=The New York Times |date=16 September 2010 |first=Stephen |last=Castle |first2=Katrin |last2=Bennhold }}</ref> The European Commission subsequently declined to follow up on the earlier threat to sue France at the European Court of Justice, or to take other legal action on the Roma matter against France.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lefigaro.fr/international/2010/10/19/01003-20101019ARTFIG00308-roms-aucune-procedure-ne-sera-lancee-contre-paris.php |work=Le Figaro |title=Roms : aucun procédure ne sera lancée contre Paris |location=France |accessdate=19 October 2010}}</ref>

Subsequently, the EU said it would seek to compel European Union countries to amend their national rules to the requirements of the European Union's free movement laws, but in so doing did not deny the lawfulness of the French actions.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://europa.eu/generalreport/pdf/rg2010_en.pdf|title=EU General Activity Report 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120201051422/http://europa.eu/generalreport/pdf/rg2010_en.pdf|archivedate=1 February 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

As a result of the action taken by Reding in the defence of the rights of citizens, national governments of the Member States of the European Union were obliged to put in place national strategies and concrete plans for the integration of [[Romani people]] and to report on their implementation annually.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=IP/12/499|title=European Commission calls on Member States to implement their national plans for Roma integration}}</ref>

In August 2012, Reding put the action of the French socialist government of [[Jean-Marc Ayrault]] and his Minister of the Interior [[Manuel Valls]] under surveillance responding to alleged expulsions of Roma people.<ref>[http://www.liberation.fr/societe/2012/08/15/l-integration-des-roms-mise-a-l-epreuve_839918 L’intégration des Roms mise à l’épreuve].
