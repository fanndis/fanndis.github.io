The '''Upper West Side''' ('''UWS''') is a neighborhood in the [[boroughs of New York City|borough]] of [[Manhattan]] in [[New York City]]. It is bounded by [[Central Park]] on the east, the [[Hudson River]] on the west, [[59th Street (Manhattan)|West 59th Street]] to the south, and [[110th Street (Manhattan)|West 110th Street]] to the north.<ref>{{cite enc-nyc }}</ref>

Like the [[Upper East Side]], the Upper West Side is an affluent, primarily residential area with many of its residents working in commercial areas of [[Midtown Manhattan|Midtown]] and [[Lower Manhattan]]. Similarly to the [[Museum Mile (Manhattan)|Museum Mile district]] on the Upper East Side, the Upper West Side is considered one of Manhattan's cultural and intellectual hubs, with [[Columbia University]] and [[Barnard College]] located just to the north of the neighborhood, and [[Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts]] and [[Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School]] located at the south end.

The Upper West Side is part of [[Manhattan Community Board 7|Manhattan Community District 7]], and its primary [[ZIP Code]]s are 10023, 10024, 10025, and 10069.<ref name="NYCPlanning"/> It is patrolled by the 20th and 24th Precincts of the [[New York City Police Department]].

==Geography==
[[File:Upper West Side Verdi Square 2007.jpg|thumb|[[Verdi Square]] at the intersection of [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]] and [[Tenth Avenue (Manhattan)|Amsterdam Avenue]]. The [[72nd Street (IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line)|72nd Street]] subway station on the {{NYCS trains|Broadway-Seventh}} is in the center of the square.]]

The Upper West Side is bounded on the south by [[59th Street (Manhattan)|59th Street]], [[Central Park]] to the east, the [[Hudson River]] to the west, and [[110th Street (Manhattan)|110th Street]] to the north.<ref>[https://nymag.com/realestate/articles/neighborhoods/upperwest.htm "Upper West Side"], nymag.com. Accessed May 10, 2009. "Boundaries: Extends north from Columbus Circle at 59th Street up to 110th Street, and is bordered by Central Park West and Riverside Park."</ref> The area north of West 96th Street and east of Broadway is also identified as [[Manhattan Valley]]. The overlapping area west of Amsterdam Avenue to Riverside Park was once known as the Bloomingdale District.

From west to east, the avenues of the Upper West Side are [[Riverside Drive (Manhattan)|Riverside Drive]], [[Eleventh Avenue (Manhattan)|West End Avenue]] (11th Avenue), Broadway, [[Tenth Avenue (Manhattan)|Amsterdam Avenue]] (10th Avenue), [[Ninth Avenue (Manhattan)|Columbus Avenue]] (9th Avenue), and [[Central Park West]] (8th Avenue). The 66-block stretch of Broadway forms the spine of the neighborhood and runs diagonally north–south across the other avenues at the south end of the neighborhood; above 78th Street Broadway runs north parallel to the other avenues. Broadway enters the neighborhood at its juncture with Central Park West at [[Columbus Circle]] (59th Street), crosses Columbus Avenue at [[Lincoln Square, Manhattan|Lincoln Square]] (65th Street), Amsterdam Avenue at [[Verdi Square]] (71st Street), and then merges with West End Avenue at [[Straus Park]] (aka Bloomingdale Square, at 107th Street).

Traditionally the neighborhood ranged from the former village of Harsenville, centered on the old Bloomingdale Road (now Broadway) and [[65th Street (Manhattan)|65th Street]], west to the railroad yards along the Hudson, then north to 110th Street, where the ground rises to Morningside Heights. With the construction of [[Lincoln Center]], its name, though perhaps not the reality, was stretched south to 58th Street. With the arrival of the corporate headquarters and expensive condos of the [[Time Warner Center]] at Columbus Circle, and the Riverside South apartment complex built by [[Donald Trump]], the area from 58th Street to 65th Street is increasingly referred to as Lincoln Square by realtors who acknowledge a different tone and ambiance than that typically associated with the Upper West Side. This is a reversion to the neighborhood's historical name.

The Upper West Side is part of [[Manhattan Community Board 7|Manhattan Community District 7]], and its primary [[ZIP Code]]s are 10023, 10024, 10025, and 10069.<ref name="NYCPlanning"/> It is patrolled by the 20th and 24th Precincts of the [[New York City Police Department]].

==History==

===Native American and colonial use===
[[File:Jan 008.jpg|thumb|A typical midblock view on the Upper West Side consisting of 4- and 5-story [[brownstone]]s]]
The long high bluff above useful sandy coves along the [[Hudson River|North River]] was little used or traversed by the [[Lenape]] people.<ref>Eric W.

In the eighteenth and early nineteenth century, the Upper West Side-to-be contained some of colonial New York's most ambitious houses, spaced along Bloomingdale Road.<ref>A colonial brick house with a hipped roof, above a lawn neatly enclosed by a white picket fence sloping down to the Bloomingdale Road appears in a daguerreotype of {{circa|1848}} that was sold at [http://www.artdaily.org/index.asp?int_sec=2&int_new=29453 Sotheby's New York, 30 March 2009].</ref> It became increasingly [[infill]]ed with smaller, more suburban villas in the first half of the nineteenth century, and in the middle of the century, parts had become decidedly lower class.

===Bloomingdale District===
The name "Bloomingdale District" was used to refer to a part of the Upper West Side – the present-day [[Manhattan Valley]] neighborhood – located between 96th and 110th Streets and bounded on the east by [[Tenth Avenue (Manhattan)|Amsterdam Avenue]] and on the west by [[Riverside Drive (Manhattan)|Riverside Drive]], [[Riverside Park (Manhattan)|Riverside Park]], and the [[Hudson River]].

Its name was a derivation of the description given to the area by Dutch settlers to [[New Netherland]], likely from [[Bloemendaal]], a town in the [[Bollenstreek|tulip region]].<ref>{{cite web |last=O'Brien |first=Jessica Lynn |title=Unearthing Bloemendaal |publisher=Cooperator |date= |url=http://cooperator.com/articles/762/1/Unearthing-Bloemendaal/Page1.html |accessdate=November 11, 2012}}</ref> The Dutch [[Anglicisation|Anglicized]] the name to "Bloomingdale" or "the Bloomingdale District", to the west side of Manhattan from about [[23rd Street (Manhattan)|23rd Street]] up to the Hollow Way (modern [[125th Street (Manhattan)|125th Street]]). It consisted of farms and villages along a road (regularized in 1703) known as the Bloomingdale Road. Bloomingdale Road was renamed The Boulevard in 1868, as the farms and villages were divided into building lots and absorbed into the city.<ref>[http://www.nyc.gov/html/lpc/downloads/pdf/reports/RIVERSIDE_-WEST_105TH_STREET_HISTORIC_DISTRICT.pdf West 105th Street Historic District] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304050210/http://www.nyc.gov/html/lpc/downloads/pdf/reports/RIVERSIDE_-WEST_105TH_STREET_HISTORIC_DISTRICT.pdf |date=March 4, 2016 }}, nyc.gov.</ref> By the 18th century it contained numerous farms and country residences of many of the city's well-off, a major parcel of which was the [[Apthorp Farm]]. The main artery of this area was the Bloomingdale Road, which began north of where Broadway and the [[Bowery|Bowery Lane (now Fourth Avenue)]] join (at modern [[Union Square (New York City)|Union Square]]) and wended its way northward up to about modern [[116th Street (Manhattan)|116th Street]] in Morningside Heights, where the road further north was known as the Kingsbridge Road. Within the confines of the modern-day Upper West Side, the road passed through areas known as Harsenville,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~nycoloni/hars.html |title=Harsenville District |publisher=Rootsweb.ancestry.com |date= |accessdate=July 19, 2014}}</ref> Strycker's Bay, and Bloomingdale Village.

With the building of the [[Croton Aqueduct]] passing down the area between present day [[Tenth Avenue (Manhattan)|Amsterdam Avenue]] and [[Ninth Avenue (Manhattan)|Columbus Avenue]] in 1838–42, the northern reaches of the district became divided into [[Manhattan Valley]] to the east of the aqueduct and Bloomingdale to the west. Bloomingdale, in the latter half of the 19th century, was the name of a village that occupied the area just south of 110th street.<ref name="dolkart">{{cite morningside |page=4}}</ref>

===Late 19th-century development===
[[File:Bloomingdale Play 10 Av 104 St jeh.jpg|thumb|left|Bloomingdale Playground, which retains the old name of Bloomingdale Road]]
Much of the riverfront of the Upper West Side was a shipping, transportation, and manufacturing corridor. The [[Hudson River Railroad]] line [[right-of-way (railroad)|right-of-way]] was granted in the late 1830s to connect New York City to Albany, and soon ran along the riverbank. One major non-industrial development, the creation of Central Park in the 1850s and '60s, caused many squatters to move their shacks into the Upper West Side. Parts of the neighborhood became a ragtag collection of squatters' housing, boarding houses, and rowdy taverns.

As this development occurred, the old name of Bloomingdale Road was being chopped away and the name Broadway was progressively applied further northward to include what had been lower Bloomingdale Road. In 1868, the city began straightening and grading the section of the Bloomingdale Road from Harsenville north, and it became known as "Western Boulevard" or "The Boulevard". It retained that name until the end of the century, when the name Broadway finally supplanted it.

Development of the neighborhood lagged even while Central Park was being laid out in the 1860s and '70s, then was stymied by the [[Panic of 1873]]. Things turned around with the introduction of the [[IRT Ninth Avenue Line|Ninth Avenue]] elevated in the 1870s along Ninth Avenue (renamed Columbus Avenue in 1890), and with [[Columbia University]]'s relocation to [[Morningside Heights]] in the 1890s, using lands once held by the [[Bloomingdale Insane Asylum]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wikicu.com/Bloomingdale_Insane_Asylum |title=Bloomingdale Insane Asylum – WikiCU, the Columbia University wiki encyclopedia |publisher=Wikicu.com |date= |accessdate=April 9, 2014}}</ref>

[[Riverside Park (Manhattan)|Riverside Park]] was conceived in 1866 and formally approved by the state legislature through the efforts of city parks commissioner [[Andrew Haswell Green]]. The first segment of park was acquired through condemnation in 1872, and construction soon began following a design created by the firm of [[Frederick Law Olmsted]], who also designed the adjacent, gracefully curving [[Riverside Drive (Manhattan)|Riverside Drive]]. In 1937, under the administration of commissioner [[Robert Moses]], {{convert|132|acre|km2}} of land were added to the park, primarily by creating a promenade that covered the tracks of the Hudson River Railroad. Moses, working with landscape architect [[Gilmore D. Clarke]] also added playgrounds, and distinctive stonework and the [[79th Street Boat Basin]], but also cut pedestrians off from direct access to most of the riverfront by building the [[Henry Hudson Parkway]] by the river's edge. According to [[Robert Caro]]'s book on Moses, ''[[The Power Broker]]'', Riverside Park was designed with most of the amenities located in predominantly white neighborhoods, with the neighborhoods closer to Harlem getting shorter shrift.<ref>{{Cite Power Broker}}</ref> Riverside Park, like Central Park, has undergone a revival late in the 20th century, largely through the efforts of the Riverside Park Fund, a citizen's group. Largely through their efforts and the support of the city, much of the park has been improved. The [[Hudson River Greenway]] along the river-edge of the park is a common route for pedestrians and bicyclists; an extension to the park's greenway runs between 83rd and 91st Streets on a promenade in the river itself.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/riversidepark/pressrelease/20918 |title=NYC Parks Press Release |publisher=Nycgovparks.org |date=November 13, 2004 |accessdate=July 19, 2014}}</ref>

===Early 20th century===

====Subway expansion====

The Upper West Side experienced a building boom from 1885 to 1910, thanks in large part to the 1904 opening of the city's [[Early history of the IRT subway|first subway line]], which comprised, in part, what is now a portion of the [[IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line]], with subway stations at [[59th Street–Columbus Circle (IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line)|59th]], [[66th Street–Lincoln Center (IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line)|66th]], [[72nd Street (IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line)|72nd]], [[79th Street (IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line)|79th]], [[86th Street (IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line)|86th]], [[91st Street (IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line)|91st]], [[96th Street (IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line)|96th]], [[103rd Street (IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line)|103rd]], [[Cathedral Parkway–110th Street (IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line)|110th]], [[116th Street–Columbia University (IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line)|116th]], and [[125th Street (IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line)|125th]] Streets. This followed upon the opening of the now demolished [[IRT Ninth Avenue Line]] – the city's first elevated railway – which opened in the decade following the [[American Civil War]].

This further stimulated [[residential development]] of the area. The stately tall apartment blocks on [[West End Avenue]] and the [[townhouse]]s on the streets between [[Tenth Avenue (Manhattan)|Amsterdam Avenue]] and Riverside Drive, which contribute to the character of the area, were all constructed during the pre-depression years of the twentieth century. A revolution in building techniques, the low cost of land relative to lower Manhattan, the arrival of the subway, and the democratization of the formerly expensive elevator made it possible to construct large apartment buildings for the middle classes. The large scale and style of these buildings is one reason why the neighborhood has remained largely unchanged into the twenty-first century.<ref name="dolkart"/>

The neighborhood changed from the 1930s to the 1950s. In 1932, the [[IND Eighth Avenue Line]] opened under Central Park West.<ref>{{cite news |title=Gay Midnight Crowd Rides First Trains in New Subway |url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FA0D13F7395513738DDDA90994D1405B828FF1D3 |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=September 10, 1932 |page=1}}</ref> In 1940, the elevated [[IRT Ninth Avenue Line]] over Columbus Avenue closed.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nycsubway.org/lines/9thave-el.html |title=www.nycsubway.org: The 9th Avenue Elevated-Polo Grounds Shuttle |publisher= |accessdate=May 14, 2016}}</ref> Immigrants from Eastern Europe and the Caribbean moved in during the '50s and the '60s.<ref name=Waxman>Waxman, Sarah.

====Enclaves====
[[File:West End Av Apthorp jeh.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[The Apthorp]] on West End Avenue]]
In the 1900s, the area south of 67th Street was heavily populated by [[African-American]]s and supposedly gained its nickname of "[[San Juan Hill, Manhattan|San Juan Hill]]" in commemoration of African-American soldiers who were a major part of the [[Battle of San Juan Hill|assault]] on [[Cuba]]'s [[San Juan Hill]] in the [[Spanish–American War]]. By 1960, it was a rough neighborhood of tenement housing, the demolition of which was delayed to allow for exterior shots in the film musical ''[[West Side Story (1961 film)|West Side Story]]''. Thereafter, [[urban renewal]] brought the construction of the [[Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts]] and [[Lincoln Towers]] apartments during 1962–1968.

The Upper West Side is a significant Jewish neighborhood, populated with both [[Ashkenazi Jews|German Jews]] who moved in at the turn of last century, and Jewish refugees escaping [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler's]] Europe in the 1930s. Today the area between [[85th Street]] and 100th Street is home to the largest community of young [[Modern Orthodox]] singles outside of Israel.<ref>{{cite news |last=Bleyer |first=Jennifer |title=Marriage on Their Minds |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/10/nyregion/thecity/10orth.html?_r=0 |accessdate=October 4, 2012 |newspaper=The New York Times |date=August 9, 2008}}</ref> However, the Upper West Side also features a substantial number of non-Orthodox Jews. A number of major synagogues are located in the neighborhood, including the oldest Jewish congregation in the United States, [[Congregation Shearith Israel|Shearith Israel]]; New York's second-oldest and the third-oldest Ashkenazi synagogue, [[B'nai Jeshurun (Manhattan)|B'nai Jeshurun]]; [[Congregation Rodeph Sholom (Manhattan)|Rodeph Sholom]]; the [[Stephen Wise Free Synagogue]]; and numerous others.

===Late 20th-century urban renewal===
[[File:Lincoln Center Manhattan Island New York photo D Ramey Logan.jpg|thumb|300px|right|[[Lincoln Square, Manhattan|Lincoln Square]] at night]]
From the post-WWII years until the [[AIDS epidemic]], the neighborhood, especially below 86th Street, had a substantial gay population. As the neighborhood had deteriorated, it was affordable to working class gay men, and those just arriving in the city and looking for their first white collar jobs. Its ethnically mixed gay population, mostly Hispanic and white, with a mixture of income levels and occupations patronized the same gay bars in the neighborhood, making it markedly different from most gay enclaves elsewhere in the city. The influx of white gay men in the Fifties and Sixties is often credited with accelerating the [[gentrification]] of the Upper West Side.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/ref/travel/TOUR-WS.html |title=Travel > Walking Tour of the Upper West Side |newspaper=The New York Times |date=October 29, 2002 |accessdate=July 19, 2014}}</ref>

In a subsequent phase of urban renewal, the rail yards which had formed the Upper West Side's southwest corner were replaced by the [[Riverside South, Manhattan|Riverside South]] residential project, which included a southward extension of Riverside Park. The evolution of Riverside South had a 40-year history, often extremely bitter, beginning in 1962 when the [[New York Central Railroad]], in partnership with the [[Amalgamated Lithographers of America|Amalgamated Lithographers Union]], proposed a mixed-use development with 12,000 apartments, Litho City, to be built on platforms over the tracks. The subsequent bankruptcy of the enlarged, but short-lived [[Penn Central Railroad]] brought other proposals and prospective developers. The one generating the most opposition was [[Donald Trump]]'s "Television City" concept of 1985, which would have included a 152-story office tower and six 75-story residential buildings. In 1991, a coalition of prominent civic organizations proposed a purely residential development of about half that size, and then reached a deal with Trump.<ref name="Kruse 2018">{{cite web|url=https://politi.co/2yU6TOa|title=The Lost City of Trump|last=Kruse|first=Michael|date=June 29, 2018|website=POLITICO Magazine|access-date=July 1, 2018}}</ref>

The community's links to the events of [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001]] were evinced in Upper West Side resident and [[Pulitzer Prize]] winner [[David Halberstam]]'s paean to the men of Ladder Co 40/Engine Co 35, just a few blocks from his home, in his book ''Firehouse''.<ref>[https://nymag.com/nymetro/arts/books/reviews/6013/ "Halberstam's Heroes"], ''Firehouse'' review by John Homans, ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'', (undated)</ref>

Today, this area is the site for several long-established charitable institutions; their unbroken parcels of land have provided suitably scaled sites for [[Columbia University]] and the [[Cathedral of Saint John the Divine, New York|Cathedral of Saint John the Divine]], as well as for some vanished landmarks, such as the [[Riverside (house)|Schwab Mansion]] on [[Riverside Drive (Manhattan)|Riverside Drive]].

The name Bloomingdale is still used in reference to a part of the Upper West Side, essentially the location of old Bloomingdale Village, the area from about 96th Street up to 110th Street and from Riverside Park east to Amsterdam Avenue. The triangular block bound by Broadway, West End Avenue, 106th Street and 107th Street, although generally known as Straus Park (named for [[Isidor Straus]] and his wife Ida), was officially designated Bloomingdale Square in 1907. The neighborhood also includes the [[Bloomingdale School of Music]] and Bloomingdale neighborhood branch of the [[New York Public Library]]. Adjacent to the Bloomingdale neighborhood is a more diverse and less affluent subsection of the Upper West Side called [[Manhattan Valley]], focused on the downslope of Columbus Avenue and [[Manhattan Avenue (Manhattan)|Manhattan Avenue]] from about 96th Street up to 110th Street.

The racial composition of the Upper West Side changed moderately from 2000 to 2010, with the greatest changes being the increase in the Asian population by 38% (4,100), the decrease in the Black population by 15% (2,435), and the increase in the Hispanic / Latino population by 8% (2,147). The White population remained the majority, experiencing a slight increase of 2% (2,098), while the small population of all other races experienced a negligible increase of 1% (58). Taking into account the two census tabulation areas, the overall decreases in the Black and Hispanic / Latino populations were concentrated in the Upper West Side area, with the Hispanic / Latino population actually increasing by a smaller margin in Lincoln Square. On the other hand, the increases in the White and Asian populations were mostly in Lincoln Center, especially the White population.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.urbanresearchmaps.org/plurality/files/RaceEthnic%20Change%20by%20Neighborhood%205-23-11.xls | title = Race / Ethnic Change by Neighborhood | publisher = Center for Urban Research, The Graduate Center, CUNY | date = 23 May 2011 | access-date = March 21, 2020 |format=Excel file}}</ref>

===Residences===

[[File:Westendave.JPG|thumb|View from 79th Street and West End Avenue]]

The apartment buildings along [[Central Park West]], facing the park, are some of the city's most opulent. [[The Dakota]] at 72nd St. has been home to numerous celebrities including [[John Lennon]], [[Leonard Bernstein]] and [[Lauren Bacall]]. Other buildings on CPW include the Art Deco [[The Century (Central Park West, Manhattan)|Century Apartments]] (Irwin Chanin, 1931), and [[The Majestic (building)|The Majestic]], also by Chanin. [[The San Remo]], [[The Eldorado]] and [[The Beresford]] were all designed by [[Emery Roth]], as was 41 West 96th Street (completed in 1926). The Alden, a sister hotel to The Beresford, was also designed by Roth. His first commission, the [[Belle Époque]] Belleclaire, is on Broadway, while the [[Streamline Moderne|moderne]] Normandie holds forth on Riverside at 86th Street. Along Broadway are several [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts]] apartment houses: [[The Belnord]] (1908) – the fronting block of which was co-named in honor of longtime resident [[I.B. Singer]], plus [[The Apthorp]] (1908), [[The Ansonia]] (1902), [[The Dorilton]] and the  Manhasset.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20061004152612/http://nyc.gov/html/lpc/downloads/pdf/reports/manhassetapts.pdf "Manhasset Apartments, 2801–2815 Broadway, 301 West 108th Street and 300 West 109th Street], [[Landmarks Preservation Commission]], May 1996</ref> All are individually designated New York City landmarks.

The serpentine Riverside Drive also has many pre-war houses and larger buildings, while West End Avenue is lined with pre-war Beaux-Arts apartment buildings and townhouses dating from the late-19th and early 20th centuries. Columbus Avenue north of 87th Street was the spine for major post-World War II urban renewal. Broadway is lined with such architecturally notable apartment buildings as [[The Ansonia]], [[The Apthorp]], [[The Belnord]], the [[Astor Court Building]], and [[The Cornwall]], which features an [[Art Nouveau]] cornice.<ref>Horsley, Carter B.

==In popular culture==
The Upper West Side has been a setting for many films and television shows because of its pre-War architecture, colorful community and rich cultural life. Ever since [[Edward R. Murrow]] went "Person-to-Person" live, the length of Central Park West in the 1950s, West Siders scarcely pause to gape at on-site trailers, and jump their skateboards over coaxial cables. At one time it seemed that one or another of the various ''[[Law & Order]]'' shows took up all the available parking spaces in the neighborhood. [[Woody Allen]]'s film ''[[Hannah and Her Sisters]]'' captures that quintessential Upper West Side flavor of rambling high-ceilinged apartments, bursting at the seams with books and other cultural artifacts.
