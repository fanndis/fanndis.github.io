'''Leonardo S.p.A.''', formerly '''Leonardo-Finmeccanica''' and '''Finmeccanica''', is an Italian [[Multinational corporation|multinational company]] specialising in [[aerospace]], [[arms industry|defence]] and [[Information security|security]]. Headquartered in [[Rome]], the company has 180 sites worldwide.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Profile - Leonardo - Aerospace, Defence and Security |url=http://www.leonardocompany.com/en/chi-siamo-about-us/profilo-profile-chisiamo-aboutus-2 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190322162953/https://www.leonardocompany.com/en/chi-siamo-about-us/profilo-profile-chisiamo-aboutus-2 |archive-date=22 March 2019 |access-date=16 March 2018 |website=www.leonardocompany.com}}</ref> It is the eighth largest [[Arms industry#List of major weapon manufacturers|defence contractor]] in the world based on 2018 revenues.<ref>[https://www.sipri.org/sites/default/files/2019-12/1912_fs_top_100_2018.pdf Top 100 Arms-Producing and Military Service Companies] SIPRI. Received 2019-12-18.</ref> The company is partially owned by the Italian government through the [[Ministry of Economy and Finance (Italy)|Ministry of Economy and Finance]], which holds 30.2% of the company's shares and is its largest shareholder.

On 1 January 2016, Leonardo-Finmeccanica became a single industrial company by integrating the activities of its subsidiaries [[AgustaWestland]], [[Alenia Aermacchi]], [[DRS Technologies]], [[Selex ES]], [[Oto Melara]] and [[Whitehead Sistemi Subacquei|WASS]]. The company is organised into five divisions (Helicopters, Aircraft, Aerostructures, Electronics, Cybersecurity). It is also the parent company and corporate centre for the subsidiaries and joint ventures [[Telespazio]], [[Thales Alenia Space]], [[MBDA]] and [[ATR (aircraft manufacturer)|ATR]]. Leonardo is listed on the [[Borsa Italiana]] and is a constituent of the [[FTSE MIB]] and [[Dow Jones Sustainability Indices]].

{{As of|April 2016}}, the company was known by the transitional name of Leonardo-Finmeccanica as part of the restructuring process of the company carried out by CEO [[Mauro Moretti]] from the beginning of his mandate in 2014. The company changed its name to Leonardo S.p.A. on 1 January 2017, after the Italian inventor [[Leonardo da Vinci]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Official Press Release |title=Finmeccanica: shareholders' meeting approves the change of the company's name and the 2015 financial statements |url=http://www.leonardocompany.com/en/-/cs-28042016 |website=Leonardocompany.com}}</ref><ref name="defensenews" />

==History==

===Foundation===
Finmeccanica was established in 1948 as the mechanical engineering subholding of the state-owned [[Istituto per la Ricostruzione Industriale|IRI]]. Finmeccanica has held for years some historic Italian enterprises, as [[Alfa Romeo]] (automobiles), [[Aeritalia]] (aerospace) and [[Gio. Ansaldo & C.|Ansaldo]] (engineering). From the 1960s to the 1980s Italy's [[defence industry|defence]] and [[aerospace industry]] was split into state-holding entities: [[EFIM]] owned the helicopters manufacturer [[Agusta]], the defence company [[Oto Melara]] and the electronic enterprise [[SELEX Galileo|Officine Galileo]], whereas [[STET - Società Finanziaria Telefonica|STET]] (another IRI subsidiary) held [[Selenia (company)|Selenia]], [[SELEX Elsag|Elsag]] and [[STMicroelectronics|SGS Thomson]], all electronic enterprises with specializations in security and defense. In 1989 an internal IRI reorganization process brought [[STET - Società Finanziaria Telefonica|STET]] electronic enterprises to Finmeccanica, and the Aeritalia-Selenia merger constituted its aerospace subsidiary [[Alenia Aeronautica|Alenia]].

===1990s===
In 1992 EFIM was wound up because of its troubled financial situation; and Agusta, Oto Melara, Officine Galileo and [[Società Italiana Ernesto Breda|Breda]] passed to Finmeccanica, which became one of the main Italian industrial groups. Finmeccanica, which was previously fully state owned by IRI, became partly privatized in 1993, when it was listed in the [[Milan]] [[Borsa Italiana]] stock exchange.

In 1992 Finmeccanica's [[Agusta]] became a 32% partner in [[NHIndustries]], the prime contractor for the [[NHI NH90|NH90 helicopter]], along with [[Eurocopter]] (62.5%) and [[Fokker]] (5.5%).

===2000s===

In July 2000 Finmeccanica and the British [[GKN]] agreed to merge their respective helicopter subsidiaries ([[Agusta]] and [[Westland Helicopters|GKN-Westland Helicopters]]) to form [[AgustaWestland]]. In December 2001 the missile business of [[Alenia Marconi Systems]] (AMS), a joint Finmeccanica/[[BAE Systems]] company, was merged with other European missile manufacturers to form [[MBDA]] which thus became the world's second largest missile manufacturer.<ref>{{Cite news |date=2001-12-21 |title=EADS, BAE and Finmeccanica Complete MBDA Merger |work=Defense Daily International |quote=the new MBDA, the world's second largest missile manufacturer behind Raytheon}}</ref> In July 2003 Finmeccanica and [[BAE Systems]] announced their intention to set up three joint venture companies, to be collectively known as [[Eurosystems]]. These companies would have pooled the avionics, [[C4ISTAR]] and communications businesses of the two companies.<ref>{{Cite news |date=3 June 2003 |title=BAE ties up £2.6bn Italian deal |work=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/3043328.stm |access-date=13 September 2007}}</ref> In March 2007 BAE Systems sold its 25% share to Finmeccanica for €400&nbsp;million.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Parmalee |first=Patricia J. |date=9 April 2007 |title=Selex Sale Sealed |work=Aviation Week and Space Technology |publisher=The McGraw-Hill Companies}}</ref> In January 2013 the company merged with Finmeccanica's other defence electronics companies, [[SELEX Elsag]] and [[SELEX Sistemi Integrati]], to become [[Selex ES]]. In May 2008 Finmeccanica announced its intention to purchase the U.S. defense contractor [[DRS Technologies]] for nearly $5.2 billion. On 22 October 2008 the sale of DRS Technologies was finalized.<ref>{{Cite news |date=22 October 2008 |title=Finmeccanica completes $5.2B DRS buy |work=The Business Journal of Milwaukee}}</ref>

===2010s===

During 2011–2013, Finmeccanica emails were published by [[WikiLeaks]] and Finmeccanica was subject to judicial inquiries on several fronts and management changes.

According to Finmeccanica emails published in the [[Syria Files]] release by [[WikiLeaks]] on 5 July 2012,<ref name="WL_Finmeccanica5Jul2012" /> Finmeccanica increased its sale of mobile communications equipment to Syrian authorities during 2011, delivering 500 of these to the [[Damascus]] suburb Muadamia in May 2011,<ref name="Delivery500Radios" /><ref name="Telegraph_Finmeccanica5Jul2012" /> after the [[Civil uprising phase of the Syrian Civil War|Syrian uprising]] had started, and sending engineers to Damascus in February 2012 to provide training in using the communications equipment in helicopter terminals,<ref name="SELEXreplyFeb2012" /> while the uprising continued.<ref name="ThReut_Finmeccanica5Jul2012" /> Finmeccanica stated that the equipment sales were legal, they occurred "before the outbreak of conflict inside Syria", and the equipment "was designed for use by emergency responders" for civilian use only.<ref name="ThReut_Finmeccanica5Jul2012" />

On 12 February 2013, the chief executive, [[Giuseppe Orsi]], was arrested on corruption charges. Prosecutors alleged that he paid bribes to ensure the sale of 12 helicopters to the Indian government, when he was head of the group's AgustaWestland unit.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-21423829 Finmeccanica's Giuseppe Orsi held on corruption charges] ''BBC''</ref><ref>{{Cite news |last=Emilio Parodi and Stephen Jewkes |date=12 February 2013 |title=Finmeccanica head arrested over India bribe allegations |work=Reuters |url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2013/02/12/uk-orsi-finmeccanica-idUKBRE91B09K20130212}}</ref>

In July 2013, the Letta government appointed former police chief Giovanni De Gennaro as Chairman of Finmeccanica. In December 2013 Finmeccanica sold 39.55% of its share capital in Ansaldo Energia to Fondo Strategico Italiano. The remaining 15% of Finmeccanica's share will be sold by December 31, 2017.

In the first half of 2014, Finmeccanica's new Chief Executive Officer and General Manager Mauro Moretti started a significant process of change for the Group, both in terms of strategic choices and organizational structure. The goal was to create a more cohesive and efficient group in which all processes (research, marketing and sales, engineering, procurement, strategies and governance) are centralized and integrated and can interact each other.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Finmeccanica, dal primo gennaio nasce la One Company |title=Repubblica.it |url=https://www.repubblica.it/economia/finanza/2015/12/22/news/finmeccanica_one_company-129999234/}}</ref> This encompasses the 100% owned companies of the core aerospace and defence business (AgustaWestland, Alenia Aermacchi, Oto Melara, Selex ES and WASS) being transformed into seven new Finmeccanica divisions. The current holding company will then become an operating company based on seven major business areas, maintaining its parent company and corporate centre function for the Group companies excluded from the model (DRS Technologies, Telespazio, Thales Alenia Space, MBDA and ATR).

At the end of 2014, Finmeccanica transferred its stake in BredaMenarinibus to the newco Industria Italiana Autobus (20% Finmeccanica and 80% King Long), thereby taking a further step in the Group's portfolio rationalization process.

In 2015 [[Hitachi]] signed a binding agreement with Finmeccanica for Hitachi's acquisition of the [[Hitachi Rail Italy|AnsaldoBreda business]], excluding some revamping activities and residual contracts, and of the entire Finmeccanica stake in the share capital of [[Ansaldo STS]], approximately 40% of the total capital.

FATA, another subsidiary of the Finmeccanica Group since 2004 that was not part of the core business, was sold in 2015 to the Gruppo Danieli, dealing in the production of steel plants.

On 1 January 2016, Finmeccanica become a single integrated industrial entity that have absorbed the activities of AgustaWestland, Alenia Aermacchi, Selex ES, OTO Melara and WASS.

=== From Finmeccanica to Leonardo ===
A company rebranding operation led by Mauro Moretti began in March 2016, with a proposal to change the company name. From 1 January 2017 Finmeccanica officially became Leonardo, a name inspired by the Italian ''savant'' [[Leonardo da Vinci]].<ref name="defensenews">{{Cite web |last=Kington |first=Tom |date=April 28, 2016 |title=It's Official: Finmeccanica Is Now Leonardo |url=http://www.defensenews.com/story/defense/policy-budget/industry/2016/04/28/leonardo-finmeccanica/83671264/ |access-date=May 1, 2016 |website=Defense News}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=April 28, 2016 |title=Finmeccanica: Shareholders’ Meeting approves the change of the Company’s name and the 2015 Financial Statements |url=http://www.leonardocompany.com/en/-/cs-28042016 |access-date=April 29, 2016 |publisher=Leonardo}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |last=Ansa en News |title=Finmeccanica meeting approves new name, 'Leonardo' |url=http://www.ansa.it/english/news/2016/04/28/-finmeccanica-meeting-approves-new-name-leonardo-_995b8ba5-2ad1-4a79-b9d4-13c8c04becd3.html}}</ref>  On 18 March 2017 the Italian Treasury proposed that the veteran banker [[Alessandro Profumo]] replace [[Mauro Moretti]] as CEO of Leonardo,<ref>{{Cite web |title=Italy proposes Profumo as new Leonardo CEO, confirms Eni, Enel chiefs |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/italy-treasury-chiefexecutives-idUSL5N1GV0DR |access-date=24 March 2017}}</ref> and on 16 May the Board appointed Alessandro Profumo to the role.<ref>{{Cite web |title=LEONARDO: IL CONSIGLIO DI AMMINISTRAZIONE NOMINA ALESSANDRO PROFUMO AMMINISTRATORE DELEGATO |url=http://www.leonardocompany.com/-/cs-28042016 |access-date=17 May 2017}}</ref>

=== 2018-2022 Industrial Plan ===

On 30 January 2018, Leonardo presented the 2018-2022 Industrial Plan<ref>{{Cite web |title=Leonardo presents 2018-2022 Industrial Plan: long term sustainable growth - DETAIL - Leonardo - Aerospace, Defence and Security |url=http://www.leonardocompany.com/en/-/piano-industriale-2018-2022 |access-date=16 March 2018 |website=www.leonardocompany.com}}</ref> with the aim of taking the necessary actions to return to sustainable growth in the five-year period.

The outlook in the reference markets is positive, particularly in international export markets, allowing Leonardo to concentrate on existing opportunities for its core businesses.

After having taken several steps towards building the "One Company" operating model, Leonardo now considers an acceleration necessary to ensure the sustainability of the business in the medium-long term, strengthening the business structure and enhancing the commercial approach.

The 2018-2022 Industrial Plan is therefore based on a transformation process that will be implemented across the areas of operating model optimisation, a more effective customer approach, targeted investments to support growth, a focus on cost control and product portfolio "reshaping".
