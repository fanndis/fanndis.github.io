He was formerly the [[Secretary-General to the President, Republic of China|Secretary-General]] to the [[President of the Republic of China]] and the Secretary-General of the [[National Security Council (Taiwan)|National Security Council]] of the [[Republic of China]] . From 2007 to 2008, he was Chief Representative of [[Republic of China]] to the [[United States]] as the head of the [[Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office]] in Washington, D.C., having been appointed to that position by President [[Chen Shui-bian]] to succeed his predecessor, [[David Lee (politician)|David Lee]]. On 26 February 2018, he took over the position of the Minister of Foreign Affairs, again succeeding [[David Lee (politician)|David Lee]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}}

==Educational background==
Prior to entering politics, he was an academic [[political science|political scientist]], finishing his PhD in political science in 1989 at [[Ohio State University]].  He wrote his doctoral thesis on progress and obstacles to democratization in Taiwan. <ref>{{Cite thesis |last1=Wu|first1=Jaushieh Joseph |title=Toward another miracle? : impetuses and obstacles in Taiwan's democratization| url=https://etd.ohiolink.edu/pg_10?0::NO:10:P10_ACCESSION_NUM:osu1487672631602026}}</ref>  He served as a teacher and [[research assistant]] in the [[political science]] department of [[Ohio State University]] in the United States, and as deputy director of the Institute of [[international relations|International Relations]] of [[National Chengchi University]] in Taiwan.

==Rise in politics==
Formerly the Deputy Secretary General of the Presidential Office for President [[Chen Shui-bian]], Wu was appointed the chairman of the [[Mainland Affairs Council]], the body charged with coordinating relations with [[Mainland China]] ([[China|the People's Republic of China]]), by Chen in May 2004.{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}}

His appointment as Chairman of the Mainland Affairs Council proved somewhat controversial due to his reputation as a supporter of [[Taiwan independence]], especially in light of the simultaneous appointment as foreign minister of former independence activist [[Mark Chen]]. Wu was the only non-[[Kuomintang]] representative of the ROC to the United States.{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}}

His tenure as head of TECRO lasted one year and three months.<ref>[http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2008/07/02/2003416290 Jason Yuan places better US ties at top of priorities] [[Taipei Times]] Jul 2, 2008, Page 3</ref>

==Cross-strait relations==

On 11 April 2013, the [[Executive Yuan|ROC Cabinet]] approved a bill to establish a [[Straits Exchange Foundation]] (SEF) branch office in [[Mainland China]] and an [[Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits]] (ARATS) office in [[Taiwan]]. Wu - who was once the ROC Minister of [[Mainland Affairs Council]] - said that for the ARATS office to be established in Taiwan, it would need to have three prerequisites: the office should never evolve to become like the [[Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region|PRC Liaison Office in Hong Kong]]; the office's mandate must be clearly defined; and the officers must adhere to international diplomatic regulations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2013/04/13/2003559521 |title=Ma ignoring Chinese hostility: TSU chairman |publisher=Taipei Times |date=2014-05-19 |accessdate=2014-05-26}}</ref>
