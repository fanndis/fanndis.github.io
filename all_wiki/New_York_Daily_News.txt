{{DISPLAYTITLE:New York ''Daily News''}}
The '''New York ''Daily News''''', officially titled the '''''Daily News''''', is an American newspaper based in [[New York City]]. Founded in 1919 by [[Joseph Medill Patterson]], as the '''''Illustrated Daily News'''''. It was the first U.S. daily printed in [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid format]], it reached its peak circulation in 1947, at 2.4 million copies a day.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Feuer |first1=Alan |title=The Daily News Layoffs and Digital Shift May Signal the Tabloid Era's End |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/28/nyregion/the-daily-news-layoffs-and-digital-shift-may-signal-the-tabloid-eras-end.html |access-date=July 31, 2018 |work=The New York Times |date=September 27, 2015}}</ref> As of 2019 it was the eleventh-highest circulated newspaper in the United States. This 20th century publication New York ''Daily News'' is not connected to an earlier 19th century ''[[New York Daily News (19th century)|New York Daily News]]'' (1855-1906), that flourished under [[Benjamin Wood (American politician)|Benjamin Wood]], and ceased publication in December 1906, but was an entirely new publication.

==History==
===''Illustrated Daily News''===
{{distinguish|text=[[Illustrated Daily News]], published in Los Angeles as a precursor of Los Angeles Mirror and eventually the Los Angeles Times}} 
[[File:Finest picture front page.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Wife of President [[Warren G. Harding]] on cover of The ''Daily News'' (February 5, 1921 front page)]]
The ''Illustrated Daily News'' was founded Patterson and his cousin, [[Robert R. McCormick]]. The two were co-publishers of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' and grandsons of [[Tribune Company]] founder Joseph Medill.<ref name=MedillBio>''Current Biography 1942'', pp. 648â€“51: "Patterson, Joseph Medill"</ref> as an imitation of the successful British newspaper ''[[Daily Mirror]]''. When Patterson and McCormick could not agree on the editorial content of the Chicago paper, the two cousins decided at a meeting in Paris that Patterson would work on the project of launching a Tribune-owned newspaper in New York. On his return, Patterson met with [[Alfred Harmsworth]], who was the Viscount Northcliffe and publisher of the ''Daily Mirror'', London's tabloid newspaper. Impressed with the advantages of a tabloid, Patterson launched the ''Daily News'' on June 26, 1919 as ''Illustrated Daily News''.<ref name=MedillBio /> The ''Daily News'' was owned by the Tribune Company until 1993.<ref name="New York Daily News">{{cite web |last1=McShane |first1=Larry |title=Mortimer B.

===''Daily News''===
The ''Daily News'' was not an immediate success, and by August 1919, the paper's circulation had dropped to 26,625.<ref name=MedillBio /> Still, New York's many [[New York City Subway|subway]] commuters found the tabloid format easier to handle, and readership steadily grew. By the time of the paper's first anniversary in June 1920, circulation had climbed over 100,000 and by 1925, over a million. Circulation reached its peak in 1947, at 2.4&nbsp;million daily and 4.7&nbsp;million on Sunday.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.company-histories.com/New-York-Daily-News-Company-History.html|title=New York Daily News|publisher=Company-Histories.com|access-date=March 20, 2018}}</ref>

The ''Daily News'' carried the slogan "New York's Picture Newspaper" from 1920 to 1991, for its emphasis on photographs. A camera has been part of the newspaper's logo from day one. The paper's later slogan, developed from a 1985 ad campaign, is "New York's Hometown Newspaper", while another has been "The Eyes, the Ears, the Honest Voice of New York". The ''Daily News'' continues to include large and prominent [[photography|photographs]], for news, entertainment and sports, as well as intense city news coverage, [[Gossip column|celebrity gossip]], [[classified advertising|classified ads]], [[comics]], a [[sports]] section, and an opinion section.

News-gathering operations were, for a time, organized by staff using two-way radios operating on 173.3250&nbsp;MHz (radio station KEA 871), allowing the assignment desk to communicate with its reporters who used a fleet of "radio cars". Excelling in sports coverage, prominent sports [[cartoonist]]s have included [[Bill Gallo]], [[Bruce Stark]] and [[Ed Murawinski]]. Columnists have included [[Walter Kaner]]. Editorial cartoonists have included [[C. D. Batchelor]].

In 1948, the ''News'' established [[WPIX]] (Channel 11 in New York City), whose call letters were based on the ''News''{{'}}s nickname of "New York's Picture Newspaper"; and later bought what became WPIX-FM, which is now known as [[WFAN-FM]]. The television station became a Tribune property outright in 1991, and remains in the former Daily News Building. The radio station was purchased by [[Emmis Communications]], and since 2014 has been owned by [[CBS Radio]] as an FM simulcast of [[WFAN (AM)|its AM namesake]].

The paper briefly published a Monday-Friday afternoon counterpart, ''Daily News Tonight'', between August 19, 1980 and August 28, 1981;<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nydailynews.com/news/clay-felker-founder-new-york-magazine-dies-age-82-article-1.351317 |title=Clay Felker, founder of New York magazine, dies at age 82 |work=New York Daily News |date=1 July 2008 |access-date=26 January 2019}}</ref> this competed with the ''[[New York Post]]'', which had launched a morning edition to complement its evening newspaper in 1978.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Martin |first1=Douglas |title=Roger Wood, a Brazen New York Post Editor, Dies at 87 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/06/business/media/roger-wood-new-york-post-editor-dies-at-87.html |website=nytimes.com |publisher=The New York Times Company |access-date=21 September 2020}}</ref> Occasional "P.M.

In 1982, and again in the early 1990s during a newspaper strike, the ''Daily News'' almost went out of business. In the 1982 instance, the parent Tribune Company offered the tabloid up for sale. In 1991, millionaire Robert Maxwell offered financial assistance to the ''News'' to help it stay in business. Upon his death later that year, the ''News'' seceded from his publishing empire which soon splintered under questions about whether Maxwell had the financial backing to sustain it. Existing management, led by editor [[James Willse]], held the ''News'' together in bankruptcy; Willse became interim publisher after buying the paper from the Tribune Company. [[Mortimer Zuckerman|Mort Zuckerman]] bought the paper in 1993.<ref name="New York Daily News"/>

The ''News'' also maintains local bureaus in the Bronx, Brooklyn, and Queens, at [[New York City Hall|City Hall]], within [[One Police Plaza]], and at the various state and federal courthouses in the city.

In January 2012, former ''[[News of the World]]'' and ''New York Post'' editor [[Colin Myler]] was appointed editor-in-chief of the ''Daily News''.<ref>Pilkington, Ed, [https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/jan/04/colin-myler-new-york-daily-news "Former NoW editor Colin Myler takes the helm at New York Daily News"], ''The Guardian'', January 4, 2012.

On September 4, 2017, Tronc (now, [[Tribune Publishing]]), the publishing operations of the former Tribune Company (which had spun out its publishing assets to separate them from its broadcast assets), announced that it had acquired the ''Daily News''.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/04/business/new-york-daily-news-sale-tronc.html|title=The Daily News, a Distinctive Voice in New York, Is Sold|last1=Ember|first1=Sydney|date=September 4, 2017|work=The New York Times|access-date=September 5, 2017|last2=Sorkin|first2=Andrew Ross|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> Tronc had bought the ''Daily News'' for $1, assuming "operational and pension liabilities".

==Editorial stance and style==
''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' journalist Alan Feuer said the ''Daily News'' focuses heavily on "deep sourcing and doorstep reporting", providing city-centered "crime reportage and hard-hitting coverage of public issues [...] rather than portraying New York through the partisan divide between liberals and conservatives".<ref name="FeuerLayoffs" /> According to Feuer, the paper is known for "speaking to and for the cityâ€™s working class" and for "its crusades against municipal misconduct".<ref name="FeuerLayoffs">{{cite news| first=Alan|last= Feuer| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/28/nyregion/the-daily-news-layoffs-and-digital-shift-may-signal-the-tabloid-eras-end.html |title=The Daily News Layoffs and Digital Shift May Signal the Tabloid Era's End|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=September 27, 2015|quote=Unlike The New York Post, which has veered from left to right, the politics of The Daily News are flexibly centrist..}}</ref>

''The New York Times'' has described the ''Daily News''{{'}}s editorial stance as "flexibly centrist"<ref name="FeuerLayoffs" /> with a "high-minded, if populist, legacy".<ref>{{cite news| first=Jonathan |last=Mahler|url= https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/30/business/media/drop-dead-not-the-newly-relevant-daily-news.html |title=Drop Dead? Not the Newly Relevant Daily News|work=The New York Times|date=January 29, 2016}}</ref> For over five decades, the ''News'' was a staunchly Republican newspaper, in line with its sister publication, the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', supporting isolationism in the early stages of [[World War II]]. By the mid-1970s however, it began shifting its stance, and during the 1990s, it gained a reputation as a moderately liberal alternative to the right-wing ''Post'' (which until 1980 had been a Democratic bastion).

The newspaper endorsed Republican [[George W.

==Headquarters==
[[File:New York Daily News building 1930.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Daily News Building]], [[John Mead Howells]] and [[Raymond Hood]], architects, rendering by [[Hugh Ferriss]]. The building housed the paper until the mid-1990s.]]

From its founding, it was based at 25 City Hall Place, just north of [[New York City Hall|City Hall]], and close to [[Park Row (Manhattan)|Park Row]], the traditional home of the city's newspaper trade. In 1921 it moved to 23 Park Place, which was in the same neighborhood. The cramped conditions demanded a much larger space for the growing newspaper.<ref name=":0">{{cite web|title=Daily News Building|url=http://s-media.nyc.gov/agencies/lpc/lp/1049.pdf|date=July 28, 1981|publisher=[[New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission]]|access-date=2020-05-24}}</ref>

From 1929 to 1995, the ''Daily News'' was based in [[Daily News Building|220 East 42nd Street]] near Second Avenue, an official city and national landmark designed by [[John Mead Howells]] and [[Raymond Hood]].<ref name=":0" /> The paper moved to [[450 West 33rd Street]] (also known as [[5 Manhattan West]]) in 1995, but the 42nd Street location is still known as The News Building and still features a giant globe and weather instruments in its lobby. (It was the model for the ''[[Daily Planet]]'' building of the first two ''[[Superman in film|Superman]]'' films). The former ''News'' subsidiary WPIX-TV remains in the building.

The subsequent headquarters of the ''Daily News'' at 450 West 33rd Street straddled the railroad tracks going into [[Pennsylvania Station (New York City)|Pennsylvania Station]]. The building is now the world headquarters of the [[Associated Press]] and is part of [[Manhattan West]].

In June 2011, the paper moved its operations to two floors at 4 New York Plaza in lower Manhattan.<ref>{{cite web|last=Deichler|first=Andrew|title=Daily News Relocating HQ to 4 New York Plaza|url=http://www.costar.com/News/Article/Daily-News-Relocating-HQ-to-4-New-York-Plaza/121598}}</ref> Sixteen months later, the structure was severely damaged and rendered uninhabitable by flooding from [[Hurricane Sandy]]. In the immediate aftermath, news operations were conducted remotely from several temporary locations, eventually moving to office space at the Jersey City printing plant.<ref>{{cite news|last=Myler|first=Colin|title=How the Daily News bested Superstorm Sandy: The Daily Planet would be proud|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/daily-planet-proud-article-1.1197068  |access-date=July 25, 2013|newspaper=Daily News|date=November 5, 2012}}</ref> In early 2013, operations moved to rented space at 1290 Avenue of the Americas near [[Rockefeller Center]]â€”just four blocks north of its rival ''[[New York Post]].'' The staff returned to the permanent 4 New York Plaza location in early November 2013.
