Throughout its history, Nickelodeon has introduced [[sister channel]]s and themed programming blocks. On January 4, 1988, Nickelodeon launched [[Nick Jr. (TV programming block)|Nick{{nbsp}}Jr.]], a weekday-morning block aimed at preschool children. On August 11, 1991, the network introduced another flagship brand, the [[Nicktoons]]: original animated productions created specifically for the network. The Nicktoons brand would eventually evolve to introduce its own [[Nicktoons (American TV channel)|sister channel]], launched in 2002. In 1999, Nickelodeon partnered with [[Sesame Workshop]] to create [[Noggin (brand)|Noggin]],<ref>{{cite news |title=Educational Outlet for Children is Announced |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1998/apr/29/entertainment/ca-43989 |publisher=[[Los Angeles Times|The Los Angeles Times]] |date=April 29, 1998 |last=Hall |first=Jane}}</ref> an educational brand consisting of a cable channel and an interactive website. Two blocks aimed at a teenage audience, [[TeenNick#As programming blocks (2001–2009)|TEENick]] (previously on Nickelodeon) and [[Noggin (brand)#The N|The N]] (previously on Noggin) were merged into a standalone channel, [[TeenNick]], in 2009.

{{As of|2018|09}}, the channel is available to about 87.167 million households in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://awfulannouncing.com/espn/nielsen-coverage-estimates-september-espn-nbcsn-nbatv-mlbn-nfln.html|title=Nielsen coverage estimates for September see gains at ESPN networks, NBCSN, and NBA TV, drops at MLBN and NFLN|website=awfulannouncing.comm|access-date=July 28, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190819062124/https://awfulannouncing.com/espn/nielsen-coverage-estimates-september-espn-nbcsn-nbatv-mlbn-nfln.html|archive-date=August 19, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

==History==
{{main|History of Nickelodeon}}
The channel's name comes from the first [[Nickel (United States coin)|five-cent]] movie theaters called [[Nickelodeon (movie theater)|nickelodeons]]. Its history dates back to December 1, 1977, when [[Time Warner Cable|Warner Cable Communications]] launched the first two-way interactive cable system, [[QUBE]],{{sfn|Hendershot|2004|pp=15–16}} in [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]], [[Ohio]]. The C-3 cable channel carried ''[[Pinwheel (TV series)|Pinwheel]]'' daily from 7:00&nbsp;a.m. to 9:00&nbsp;p.m. Eastern Time,{{sfn|Hendershot|2004|pp=15–16}}<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.qube-tv.com/qube-tv/GUIDE_PDFS/PAGE47-48.pdf |title=Pinwheel Everyday 7am to 9pm |publisher=QUBE |date=1977 |access-date=December 8, 2016 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131211111538/http://www.qube-tv.com/qube-tv/GUIDE_PDFS/PAGE47-48.pdf |archive-date=December 11, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> and the channel was labelled "Pinwheel" on remote controllers, as it was the only program broadcast. Initially scheduled for a February 1979 launch,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/37580454/television_better_shows_for_youngsters/|title=Television: Better shows for youngsters?|date=1978-12-14|work=The Philadelphia Inquirer|access-date=2019-10-21|pages=46}}</ref> Nickelodeon launched on April 1, 1979, initially distributed to Warner Cable systems via satellite on the [[RCA]] [[Satcom (satellite)|Satcom-1]] transponder (the owner of the satellite, RCA Americom, later became GE Americom as a result of [[General Electric]]'s acquisition of RCA Americom's parent company, [[RCA Corporation]], before merging with [[Luxembourg]] based [[SES S.A.|Société Européenne des Satellites]] to form SES Global, now SES S.A, which one of the descendants of the Satcom series, the SES and AMC satellite constellations, stil operate, Nickelodeon presently broadcasts on [[AMC-11]]).<ref name="cablecenter.org">{{cite web|url=http://www.cablecenter.org/barco-library-hauser-oral-history/item/hauser-gustave.html|title=Gustave Hauser 1999 Oral and Video History|publisher=The Cable Center|work=cablecenter.org|access-date=December 6, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140219000524/http://cablecenter.org/barco-library-hauser-oral-history/item/hauser-gustave.html|archive-date=February 19, 2014|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Originally commercial-free, advertising was introduced in January 1984.<ref name="MilwaukeeSentinel"/>

==Programming==
{{Main|List of programs broadcast by Nickelodeon}}
Programming seen on Nickelodeon includes animated series (such as ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]'', ''[[The Loud House]]'', ''[[The Casagrandes]]'', and ''[[It's Pony]]''), live-action, scripted series (such as ''[[Danger Force]]'', ''[[Tyler Perry's Young Dylan]]'' and ''[[All That]]''), and original [[television film|made-for-TV movies]], while the network's daytime schedule is dedicated to shows targeting preschoolers (such as ''[[Bubble Guppies]]'', ''[[PAW Patrol]]'', and ''[[Blue's Clues & You!]]'').

A re-occurring program was bi-monthly special editions of ''[[Nick News with Linda Ellerbee]]'',{{sfn|Hendershot|2004|p=54}} a news magazine series aimed at children that debuted in 1992 as a weekly series and ended in 2015.<ref>{{cite web|author=Pam Gelman|url=http://www.commonsensemedia.org/tv-reviews/Nick-News-with-Linda.html/details|title=Nick News with Linda Ellerbee - TV Show Rating For Kids and Families|publisher=Commonsensemedia.org|access-date=June 2, 2010}}{{dead link|date=January 2017}}</ref>

===Nicktoons===
{{Main|Nicktoons}}
'''Nicktoons''' is the branding for Nickelodeon's original [[animation|animated]] [[television series]].{{sfn|Hendershot|2004|p=87}}{{sfn|Klickstein|2013}} Until 1991, the animated series that aired on Nickelodeon were largely imported from foreign countries, with some original animated specials that were also featured on the channel up to that point.{{sfn|Hendershot|2004|pp=104-105}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-4067509.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110624034529/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-4067509.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=June 24, 2011|title=Nickelodeon ventures into cartoons|publisher=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|via=[[HighBeam Research]]|date=August 10, 1991|last=Cerone|first=Daniel}}</ref> Though the Nicktoons branding has seldom been used by the network itself since the 2002 launch of the channel [[Nicktoons (American TV channel)|of the same name]], original animated series continue to make up a substantial portion of Nickelodeon's lineup.{{sfn|Klickstein|2013}} Roughly 6 to 7 hours of these programs are seen on the weekday schedule, and around nine hours on weekends, including a dedicated weekend morning animation [[Block programming|block]].{{sfn|Hendershot|2004|pp=104-105}}

In 2006, the channel struck a deal with [[DreamWorks Animation]] to develop the studio's animated films into television series (such as ''[[The Penguins of Madagascar]]'').<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvsquad.com/2006/10/25/nickelodeon-and-dreamworks-teaming-up/|title=Nickelodeon and Dreamworks teaming up|publisher=Tvsquad.com|date=October 25, 2006|access-date=June 2, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180725033239/http://www.tvsquad.com/2006/10/25/nickelodeon-and-dreamworks-teaming-up/|archive-date=July 25, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> Since the early 2010s, [[Nickelodeon Animation Studio]] has also produced series based on preexisting [[intellectual property|IP]] purchased by ViacomCBS, such as ''[[Winx Club]]'' and ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2012 TV series)|Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]''.

===Movies===
{{Main|List of Nickelodeon original films}}
Nickelodeon does not air theatrically released or direct-to-video movies on a regular basis; however, it does produce its own original made-for-TV movies, which usually premiere in weekend evening timeslots or on [[school holiday]]s.

The channel occasionally airs feature films produced by the network's [[Nickelodeon Movies]] film production division (whose films are distributed by sister company [[Paramount Pictures]]). Although the film division bears the Nickelodeon brand name, the channel does not have access to most of the movies produced by its film unit. Nickelodeon does have broadcast rights to most feature films based on or that served as the basis for original series produced by it (such as ''[[Barnyard (film)|Barnyard: The Original Party Animals]]''); the majority of the live-action feature films produced under the Nickelodeon Movies banner are licensed for broadcast by various free-to-air and pay television outlets within the United States other than Nickelodeon (although the network has aired a few live-action Nickelodeon Movies releases such as ''[[Angus, Thongs and Perfect Snogging]]'' and ''[[Good Burger]]'').

Nickelodeon also advertises hour-long episodes of its original series as movies;{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} though the "TV movie" versions of Nickelodeon's original series differ from traditional television films in that they have shorter running times (approximately 45 minutes, as opposed to 75–100 minute run times that most television movies have), and use a traditional [[multiple-camera setup|multi-camera]] setup for regular episodes (unless the program is natively shot in the [[single-camera setup]] common of films) with some on-location filming. Nickelodeon also periodically acquires theatrically released feature films for broadcast on the channel including [[Universal Studios Home Entertainment|Universal]]'s ''[[Barbie: A Fashion Fairytale]]'', several [[Monster High]] films, and ''[[Turtles Forever|Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Turtles Forever]]'' (which was later released by Nickelodeon Movies through Paramount for DVD release), with the Barbie and Monster High films usually aired under a [[brokered programming|brokered]] format in which [[Mattel]] purchases the time in order to promote the release of their films on DVD within a few days of the Nickelodeon premiere, an arrangement possible as Nickelodeon does not have to meet the [[Federal Communications Commission]] rules which disallow that arrangement for broadcast channels due to regulations disallowing [[infomercial|paid programming]] to children.

===Programming blocks===
The network's main programming is usually broadcast from 6:00&nbsp;a.m. to 9:00&nbsp;p.m. on weekdays (the sign off time varies with holidays and special programming), Saturdays from 6:00&nbsp;a.m. to 9:30&nbsp;p.m. (Eastern and Pacific Time).

====Current====
* '''''[[Nick Jr. (TV programming block)|Nick Jr.]]''''' – Nickelodeon currently programs shows targeted at preschool-age children on Monday through Fridays from 7:00 a.m to 1:00&nbsp;p.m. Eastern and Pacific Time (7:00 to 10:00&nbsp;a.m. during the summer months, other designated school break periods, and on national holidays). The block primarily targets audiences of preschool age as Nickelodeon's usual audience of school-age children are in school during the block's designated time period. Programs currently seen in this block include ''[[Blaze and the Monster Machines]]'', ''[[Bubble Guppies]]'', ''[[PAW Patrol]]'', ''[[Peppa Pig]]'', ''[[Ryan's Mystery Playdate|Ryan’s Mystery Playdate]]'' , ''[[Blue's Clues & You!|Blue’s Clues & You!]]'' , and ''[[Santiago of the Seas]]''.
* '''''[[Nickelodeon Saturday programming block|Nick Saturday Nights]]''''' – a [[prime time|primetime]] live-action block airing from 8:00 to 9:30&nbsp;p.m. Eastern and Pacific Time. It launched on September 22, 2012, as ''Gotta See Saturday Nights''. Recent episodes of certain original series may air when no new episodes are scheduled to air that week. The schedule features ''[[All That]],'' ''[[Tyler Perry's Young Dylan|Tyler Perry’s Young Dylan]]'', ''[[Danger Force]]'', ''[[Nickelodeon's Unfiltered]]'' and ''[[Group Chat (talk show)|Group Chat]]'' (all first-run episodes are cycled on the schedule, giving it a variable schedule). Premieres of the network's original made-for-TV movies also occasionally air during the primetime block, usually in the form of premiere showings.

====Former====
* '''[[SNICK]]''' – "SNICK" (short for "Saturday Night Nickelodeon") was the network's first dedicated Saturday primetime block that aired from 8:00 to 10:00&nbsp;p.m. Eastern and Pacific Time. Geared toward pre-teens and teenagers, it debuted on August 15, 1992 (with the initial lineup featuring two established series that originally aired on Sundays, ''[[Clarissa Explains It All]]'' and ''[[The Ren & Stimpy Show]]'', and two new series, ''[[Roundhouse (TV series)|Roundhouse]]'' and ''[[Are You Afraid of the Dark?]]''). The block mainly featured live-action series (primarily comedies), although it periodically featured animated series. SNICK was discontinued on August 28, 2004, and was replaced the following week (September 4, 2004) by a Saturday night edition of the TEENick block.
* '''[[Nick in the Afternoon]]''' – "Nick in the Afternoon" was a daytime block that ran on weekday afternoons during the summer months from 1995 to 1997, and aired in an extended format until December for its final year in 1998. It was hosted by Stick Stickly, a [[Mr. Bill]]-like popsicle stick character (puppeteered by Rick Lyon and voiced by actor [[Paul Christie (voice actor)|Paul Christie]], who would later voice the Noggin mascot [[Moose and Zee|Moose A. Moose]]). The block was replaced for the summer of 1999 by "Henry and June's Summer" (hosted by the animated hosts of the [[anthology series]] ''[[KaBlam!]]''). The Stick Stickly character was later revived for "The '90s Are All That" on TeenNick, which debuted in 2011.
* '''[[U-Pick Live]]''' – "U-Pick Live" (originally branded as "U-Pick Friday" from 1999 to late 2000, and originally hosted by the Henry and June characters from ''KaBlam!'') was a block that aired weekday afternoons from 5:00 to 7:00&nbsp;p.m. Eastern and Pacific Time from October 14, 2002, to May 27, 2005, which was broadcast from studios in [[New York City]]'s [[Times Square]] district, where Nickelodeon is headquartered. Using a similar concept that originated in 1994 with the Nick in the Afternoon block, "U-Pick Live" allowed viewer interaction in selecting the programs (usually cartoons) that would air on the block via voting on the network's website. The concept of user-chosen programming was later used as part of a Friday edition of TeenNick's "The '90s Are All That" block that ran in 2011.
* '''[[TEENick]]''' – "TEENick" was a teen-oriented block that ran from March 6, 2001 to February 2, 2009, which ran on Sundays from 6:00 to 9:00&nbsp;p.m. Eastern and Pacific Time; a secondary block on Saturdays launched in 2004, taking over the 8:00 to 10:00&nbsp;p.m. Eastern and Pacific Time slot long held by SNICK. It was originally hosted by Nick Cannon, and then by Jason Everhart (aka "J. Boogie"). Beginning in January 2007, [[Noggin (brand)|Noggin]]'s own teen-targeted block [[Noggin (brand)#The N|The N]] ran a spin-off block called "TEENick on The N." The TEENick name, which was dropped on February 2, 2009, later became the name of the channel [[TeenNick]] on September 28, 2009.
* '''''ME:TV''''' – "ME:TV" was a short-lived live hosted afternoon block that ran during the summer of 2007, which ran on weekday afternoons from 2:00 to 6:00&nbsp;p.m. Eastern and Pacific Time.
* '''''[[Nick Studio 10]]''''' – "Nick Studio 10" was a short-lived late afternoon programming block that ran from February 18 to June 17, 2013, which ran weekdays from 4:00 to 6:00&nbsp;p.m. Eastern and Pacific Time. The block featured wraparound segments based on episodes of the network's animated series, which were shown in an off-the-clock schedule due to the segments that aired following each program's individual acts.

====Special events====
[[File:Nickelodeon Slime Cup SG 2017.jpg|thumb|Guest appearance of mascots including characters from Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, SpongeBob SquarePants and Paw Patrol from Nickelodeon during the Nickelodeon Slime Cup SG event held in City Square Mall, Singapore in July, 2017]]
* '''''[[Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards]]''''' – The ''Kids' Choice Awards'' are a 90-minute-long annual live [[awards show]] held on the fourth Saturday night in March (formerly the first Saturday in April until 2008). The award show (whose winners are selected by Nickelodeon viewers though voting on the channel's website and through [[text messaging]]) honors popular television series and movies, actors, athletes and music acts, with winners receiving a hollow orange blimp figurine (one of the logo outlines used for much of the network's "splat logo" era from 1984 to 2009).
* '''[[Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards#Kids' Choice Sports|Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Sports]]''' – A spin-off of the ''Kids' Choice Awards'', "Kids Choice Sports" is held in July with the same KCA voting procedures and differing categories for team sports and athlete achievements for the previous year (featuring categories such as "Best Male Athlete", "Best Female Athlete", "King Of Swag", and "Queen Of Swag"), along with the award featuring a sports-specific purple [[Mohawk hairstyle|mohawk]]. Its inaugural ceremony aired on July 17, 2014, and originally suspended the international channels so people could only watch it on the main channel.
* '''[[Nickelodeon HALO Awards]]'''  –  The HALO Awards features 5 ordinary teens who are Helping And Leading Others (HALO).  Its inaugural ceremony aired on December 11, 2009. The awards show is hosted by [[Nick Cannon]] and airs on Nickelodeon and TeenNick every November/December.
* '''[[Worldwide Day of Play]]''' – The "Worldwide Day of Play" is an annual event held on a Saturday afternoon in late September that began on October 2, 2004, to mark the conclusion of the "[[Let's Just Play Go Healthy Challenge|Let's Just Play]]" campaign launched that year, which are both designed to influence kids to exercise and participate in outdoor activities; schools and educational organizations are also encouraged to host local events to promote activity among children during the event. Nickelodeon and its sister channels (except for the Pacific and Mountain Time Zone feeds and the Nick 2 Pacific feed that is distributed to the Eastern and Central Time Zones), some of the network's international channels and associated websites are suspended (with a message encouraging viewers to participate in outdoor activities during the period) from 12:00 to 3:00&nbsp;p.m. Eastern and Pacific Time on the day of the event.<ref>{{cite web|author=Joe Lepper|url=http://www.mediaweek.co.uk/news/217537/Nickelodeon-tells-kids-go-play-anniversary/|title=Nickelodeon tells kids to go out and play for anniversary|work=Media Week|date=July 26, 2004|access-date=November 25, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110813183315/http://www.mediaweek.co.uk/news/217537/Nickelodeon-tells-kids-go-play-anniversary/|archive-date=August 13, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref> Since 2010, the Worldwide Day of Play event became part of The Big Help program, as part of an added focus on healthy lifestyles in addition to the program's main focus on environmental issues.

====Nickelodeon-produced blocks on broadcast networks====
*'''Nickelodeon en Telemundo''' – On November 9, 1998, [[Telemundo]] debuted a daily block of Spanish [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|dubs]] of Nickelodeon's series (such as ''[[Rugrats]]'', ''[[Aaahh!!! Real Monsters]]'', ''[[Hey Arnold!]]'', ''[[Rocko's Modern Life]]'', ''KaBlam!'' and ''[[Blue's Clues]]''); the weekday edition of the block ran until September 5, 2000, when it was relegated to weekends in order to make room for the morning news program ''Hoy En El Mundo''; Nickelodeon's contract with Telemundo ended in November 2001, after the network was acquired by [[NBC]].
[[File:Nick on CBS.gif|thumb|134px|The historical Nick on CBS logo used until its discontinuation in 2004.]]
*'''[[Nickelodeon on CBS|Nick on CBS/Nick Jr. on CBS]]''' – On September 14, 2002, Nickelodeon began producing a two-hour Saturday morning block for [[CBS]] (which was co-owned with Nickelodeon at the time as a result of then-network parent [[Viacom (original)|Viacom]]'s 1999 acquisition of CBS) to comply with the [[Children's Television Act]]. The block featured episodes of series such as ''[[As Told by Ginger]]'', ''[[The Wild Thornberrys]]'', ''Rugrats'', ''Hey Arnold!,'' and ''[[Pelswick]]'' which debuted on most [[CBS]] stations. The block was retooled in 2004 as a preschool-oriented block featuring Nick Jr. shows (such as ''Blue's Clues'', ''[[Dora the Explorer]],'' and ''[[Little Bill]]''); "Nick Jr. on CBS" was replaced in September 2006 by the [[Cookie Jar TV|KOL Secret Slumber Party]] block (produced by [[DIC Entertainment]], which was subsequently acquired by [[Cookie Jar (company)|Cookie Jar]]), as a result of [[CBS Corporation|CBS]] and [[Viacom (2005–present)|Viacom]]'s split into separate companies earlier that year.

===Current sister channels===

====Nicktoons====
{{Main|Nicktoons (TV channel)}}
'''Nicktoons''' is a [[pay television]] network that launched on May 1, 2002, as '''Nicktoons TV'''; it was renamed Nicktoons in May 2003 and rebranded as '''Nicktoons Network''' in 2005 before reverting to its previous name in September 2009. The network airs a mix of newer live-action and animated shows from Nickelodeon (like ''[[Henry Danger]]'', ''[[The Fairly OddParents]]'', ''[[The Loud House]]'', ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]'', and ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2012 TV series)|Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]'' along with original series airing exclusively on Nicktoons).

====Nick Jr.====
{{Main|Nick Jr.}}
'''Nick Jr.''' is a pay television network aimed primarily at children between 2 and 7 years of age, featuring a mix of current and some former preschool-oriented programs from Nickelodeon, and original series exclusive to the channel. It launched on September 28, 2009 as a spin-off of Nickelodeon's long-running preschool [[Nick Jr. (TV programming block)|programming block of the same name]], which had aired since January 4, 1988.

The channel replaced [[Noggin (brand)#TV channel|Noggin]], which was relaunched as a [[streaming service]] in 2015 and acts as a separate sister brand. [[List of programs broadcast by Noggin|Noggin's programming]] is distinct from the Nick Jr. channel's; it mainly carried pre-teen-oriented programs at its launch,<ref>{{cite news |last1=Barker |first1=Kate |title=Noggin spawns original educon for older kids |url=http://kidscreen.com/2000/02/01/27973-20000201/ |work=[[Playback (magazine)|Kidscreen]] |publisher=Brunico Communications}}</ref> and its 2015 streaming service features a variety of exclusive series. On October 1, 2012, the Nick Jr. network debuted [[NickMom]], a four-hour nightly program block aimed at mothers.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.deadline.com/2012/08/nick-jr-%E2%80%99s-nickmom-primetime-comedy-block-sets-launch-date-adds-docu-series/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120816235336/http://www.deadline.com/2012/08/nick-jr-%E2%80%99s-nickmom-primetime-comedy-block-sets-launch-date-adds-docu-series/ |archive-date=August 16, 2012 |title=Nick Jr.'s NickMom Primetime Comedy Block Sets Launch Date, Adds Docu Series |url-status=dead |access-date=August 29, 2012}}</ref> The block was controversial upon its launch due to its more lenient content standards (including some [[profanity]], crude humor and suggestive references) than what is otherwise permitted on Nick Jr., particularly as the network operates a singular Eastern Time Zone feed, which resulted in the NickMom block airing at the same time in all six U.S. time zones (being broadcast as early as 5:00&nbsp;p.m. in the [[Hawaii–Aleutian Time Zone]]).<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.azfamily.com/news/Sexual-comedy-show-airs-on-toddler-network--173937121.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130126101226/http://www.azfamily.com/news/Sexual-comedy-show-airs-on-toddler-network--173937121.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=January 26, 2013 |title=Sexual comedy show airs on toddler network |last=Hoffman |first=Sybil |date=October 15, 2012 |publisher=[[KTVK]], [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] |access-date=October 16, 2012}}</ref> While traditional advertising appeared on the channel during the NickMom block, the network otherwise only runs programming promotions and [[underwriting|underwriter-style sponsorships]] in lieu of regular commercials.

====TeenNick====
{{Main|TeenNick}}
'''TeenNick''' is a pay television network that is aimed at [[adolescent]]s and young adults, named after the [[TeenNick#As programming blocks (2001–2009)|TEENick block]] that aired on Nickelodeon from March 2001<ref>{{cite web|last=Reynolds|first=Mike|title=New Nick Block Aims for Tweens|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-71874376.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105162615/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-71874376.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=November 5, 2012|work=[[Cable World]]|publisher=HighBeam Research|access-date=February 25, 2011|date=February 19, 2001}}</ref> to February 2009. The channel acts as a merger between the TEENick block and "[[Noggin (brand)#The N|The N]]" on Noggin. Although TeenNick has more relaxed program standards than the other Nickelodeon channels (save for Nick at Nite and the NickMom block on Nick Jr.) – allowing for moderate profanity, suggestive dialogue and some violent content – the network has shifted its lineup almost exclusively towards current and former Nickelodeon series (including some that are [[burning off|burned off]] due to low ratings on the flagship channel) that have stricter content standards. It also airs some acquired sitcoms and drama series.

====NickRewind====
{{Main|NickRewind}}
On July 25, 2011, TeenNick began airing ''[[The '90s Are All That]]'', renamed ''The Splat'' in October 2015, a block of Nickelodeon's most popular 1990s programming, targeting the network's target demographic from that era.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=The Vulture|title=Nick's New Nineties Nostalgia Block Is a Ratings Smash|url=https://nymag.com/daily/entertainment/2011/07/nicks_new_90s_nostalgia_block.html|work=New York|first=Josef|last=Adalian|access-date=October 9, 2011|date=July 26, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207155550/http://nymag.com/daily/entertainment/2011/07/nicks_new_90s_nostalgia_block.html|archive-date=February 7, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>

Through several name changes, the block is now called "NickRewind" and focuses on programming from the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s (even though the block mostly focus on the latter two), and airs nightly from 10PM to 6AM Eastern.

====NickMusic====
{{Main|NickMusic}}
'''NickMusic''' is a pay television network in the United States mainly featuring music video and music-related programming from younger pop artists that appeal to Nickelodeon's target audience. It launched on the channel space formerly held by MTV Hits on September 9, 2016.

====TV Land====
{{Main|TV Land}}
'''TV Land''' is a pay television channel that debuted on April 29, 1996 as "Nick at Nite's TV Land".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_text_direct-0=0EAE90B826926DA2&p_field_direct-0=document_id |title=TV Land Opens up on MONDAY |date=April 23, 1996 |access-date=February 3, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130518162742/http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_text_direct-0=0EAE90B826926DA2&p_field_direct-0=document_id |archive-date=May 18, 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref> Based on the Nick at Nite block, it originally aired classic television series from the early 1950s to the 1970s, but beginning in 2004, has broadened its programming inventory to include series from the 1980s and 1990s (and more recently, the 2000s). In 2008, TV Land began producing its own original series: originally these were reality series; however, the network ventured into scripted originals with the 2010 debut of ''[[Hot in Cleveland]]''. On December 17, 2006, Viacom's MTV Networks Kids & Family Group division took over operational responsibilities for TV Land from Nick at Nite (concurrent with Nickelodeon taking operational duties for Nick at Nite), though TV Land continues to be operated as part of the company's Viacom Media Networks unit.

===Former sister channels===

====Nickelodeon Games and Sports for Kids====
{{Main|Nickelodeon Games and Sports for Kids}}
'''Nickelodeon Games and Sports for Kids''' (commonly branded as '''Nickelodeon GAS''' or '''Nick GAS'''), was a pay television network that launched on March 1, 1999, as part of the suite of high-tier channels launched by MTV Networks. It ran a mix of [[game show]]s and other competition programs from Nickelodeon (essentially formatted as a children's version of—and Viacom's answer to—the [[Game Show Network]]). The channel formally ceased operations on December 31, 2007, and it was replaced by a short-lived 24-hour version of Noggin's teen-oriented block The N. However, an automated loop of Nick GAS continued to be carried on [[Dish Network]] due to unknown factors until April 23, 2009.

====NickMom====
{{Main|NickMom}}
'''NickMom''' (stylized as '''nickmom''') was a programming block launched on October 1, 2012, airing in the late night hours on Nick Jr. The block attempted original programming targeted towards young mothers until 2014, then began to carry acquired films and sitcoms, along with the 2010 version of the TV series ''[[Parenthood (2010 TV series)|Parenthood]]''. Due to Viacom's 2015 cutbacks involving acquired programming and low ratings, the NickMom block and associated website were discontinued in the early morning hours of September 28, 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/NickMom/status/641706404731035648|title=Unlike your laundry pile, some things do come to an end.

====Nick 2====
[[File:Nick 2 logo (2010).svg|125px|left]]
Nick 2 was the off-air brand for a secondary [[timeshift channel]] of Nickelodeon formerly available on the high-tier packages exclusively on cable providers as a complement to the main Nickelodeon feed, repackaging Nickelodeon's Eastern and Pacific Time Zone feeds for the appropriate time zone – the Pacific feed was distributed to the Eastern and Central Time Zones, and the Eastern feed was distributed to the Pacific and Mountain Time Zones – resulting in the difference in local airtimes for a particular program between two geographic locations being three hours at most, allowing viewers a second chance to watch a program after its initial airing on the Eastern Time Zone feed or to watch the show ahead of its airing on the Pacific Time Zone feed of the main channel (for example, the Nick at Nite block would respectively start at 9:00&nbsp;p.m (Sundays-Fridays) & At 10:30 p.m (Saturdays) Eastern on Nick 2 Pacific or 12:00&nbsp;p.m. (weekdays) 10:00 a.m (weekends) Pacific weeknights on Nick 2 Eastern). Nick 2 would never broadcast in high definition. The service existed from around 2000 until November 2018, launching as '''Nick TOO'''.

The timeshift channel was originally offered as part of the MTV Networks Digital Suite, a slate of channels exclusive to high-tier cable packages (many of the networks also earned satellite carriage over time), and was the only American example of two feeds of a non-[[pay television|premium service]] being provided to cable and [[IPTV]] providers. A '''Nick TOO''' logo was used on the channel until 2004, when MTV Networks decided to stop using customized branding on the feed (a logo for Nick 2 was only used for identification purposes on [[electronic program guide]]s as a [[:wikt:placeholder|placeholder]] image); most television listings thus showed the additional channel under the brandings "Nickelodeon Pacific/NICKP" or "Nickelodeon Eastern/NICKE".

On another note, [[DirecTV]] and [[Dish Network]] also offer both Nickelodeon feeds, though they carry both time zone feeds of most of the children's networks that the providers offer by default.

[[Viacom Media Networks]] discontinued the Nick 2 digital cable service on November 22, 2018, likely due to [[video on demand]] options making timeshift channels for the most part superfluous. Both time zone feeds continue to be offered on satellite providers, unbranded.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://drive.google.com/file/d/1981RU9wzxQhvkZvhufkXEumBc9MtpXDq/view?usp=sharing|title=Spectrum legal notice - "Effective on or after November 22, 2018, Viacom will discontinue distribution of Nick2.

Its programming was also streamed via the Nick.com website and on New York City radio station [[WHTZ]] as a secondary [[HD Radio|HD]] channel. Nick Radio focused on [[Top 40]] and [[pop music]] (geared towards the network's target audience of children and adolescents, with [[radio edit]]s of some songs incorporated due to inappropriate content), along with celebrity interview features. In addition to regular on-air [[Disc jockey|DJs]], Nick Radio also occasionally featured guest DJ stints by popular artists as well as stars from Nickelodeon's original series.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.radioink.com/article.asp?id=2705468&spid=24698|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005005043/http://www.radioink.com/article.asp?id=2705468&spid=24698|url-status=dead|archive-date=October 5, 2013|title=Nickelodeon And Clear Channel Launch Nick Radio|work=Radio Ink|date=September 30, 2013|access-date=October 1, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/210305/clear-channels-iheartradio-unveils-nick-radio.html|title=Clear Channel's iHeartRadio Unveils Nick Radio|work=MediaPost|date=September 30, 2013|access-date=October 1, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131003015347/http://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/210305/clear-channels-iheartradio-unveils-nick-radio.html|archive-date=October 3, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allaccess.com/net-news/archive/story/122831/nickelodeon-and-ccm-e-launch-first-ever-nick-brand|title=Nickelodeon And CCM+E Launch First Ever Nick-Branded Radio Station On iHeartradio And Nick.Com|work=All Access Media Group|date=October 1, 2013|access-date=October 1, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004060109/http://www.allaccess.com/net-news/archive/story/122831/nickelodeon-and-ccm-e-launch-first-ever-nick-brand|archive-date=October 4, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>

Nick Radio shut down without warning on July 31, 2019 and was replaced by Hit Nation Junior, likely due to the network's general failure to establish any sustained "triple threat" artists/actors throughout the 2010s, along with the general failure of the children's-only radio format in the streaming age. It was also a non-prime asset in Viacom's current 'six prime networks' strategy, leaving it vulnerable to being terminated.

[[File:Nickelodeon Studios in Hard Rock Cafe.jpg|thumb|right|245px|Nickelodeon Studios as viewed from the [[Hard Rock Cafe]] in March 2004 before it closed]]
All except three Nickelodeon-themed theme park areas now closed:

====Current attractions====
* '''Nickland''' is an area inside of [[Movie Park Germany]] featuring Nickelodeon-themed rides, including a SpongeBob SquarePants-themed "Splash Battle" ride, and a [[Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius|Jimmy Neutron]]-themed roller coaster. This area is currently being expanded to fill space formerly occupied with rides based on [[Warner Bros.]] characters.
* '''[[Nickelodeon Land]]''' opened on May 4, 2011, at [[Blackpool Pleasure Beach]], featuring several rides based on Nickelodeon series including ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]'', ''[[Avatar: The Last Airbender]]'', ''[[Dora the Explorer]],'' and ''[[The Fairly OddParents]]''.
* '''[[Beach Break Bay|Nickelodeon Land]]''' opened in September 2015 at [[Sea World (Australia)|Sea World]], featuring multiple rides based on Nickelodeon programs including a SpongeBob junior roller coaster, and a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles-themed flyer.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}
*[[Nickelodeon Universe]], the largest indoor theme park in North America, opened on October 25, 2019, at the American Dream mall located in East Rutherford, New Jersey.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/20/us/giant-nickelodeon-theme-park-new-jersey-trnd/index.html|title=Nickelodeon Universe, the largest indoor theme park in North America, opens this week|author=Gabrielle Sorto|website=CNN|access-date=2019-12-08}}</ref>

====Closed areas====
* Nickelodeon Universe was also an area inside of Paramount's [[Kings Island]] featuring Nickelodeon-themed rides and attractions. It was one of the largest sections in the park and was voted "Best Kid's Area" by ''Amusement Today'' magazine from 2001 until its closure in 2009 after the park's sale to [[Cedar Fair]] (the Paramount Parks ended up with [[CBS Corporation]] in the 2006 CBS/Viacom split, which CBS immediately sold off as soon as possible as non-critical surplus assets for that company). In March 2008, another version of Nickelodeon Universe opened at [[Mall of America]] with many characters from the network's series including ''SpongeBob SquarePants'' and ''Dora the Explorer''.
* '''[[Nickelodeon Studios]]''' was an attraction at the [[Universal Orlando]] Resort that opened on June 7, 1990, and housed production for many Nickelodeon programs (including ''Clarissa Explains It All'', ''[[What Would You Do? (game show)|What Would You Do?]]'' and ''All That''). It closed on April 30, 2005, after Nickelodeon's production facilities were moved to New York City and Burbank, California. The building that formerly housed it is now occupied by the [[Blue Man Group Sharp Aquos Theatre]]. Another Nickelodeon-themed attraction at the park, [[Jimmy Neutron's Nicktoon Blast]], opened in 2003 but closed in 2011 to make way for the new ride ''[[Despicable Me: Minion Mayhem]]'', which was based on the 2010 film ''[[Despicable Me]]''. In 2012, a store based on SpongeBob SquarePants opened in ''Woody Woodpecker's Kidzone'', replacing Universal's Cartoon Store.
* '''[[Nickelodeon Central]]''' was an area inside of the [[Paramount Parks]] properties, including [[California's Great America]], [[Carowinds]], [[Kings Dominion]], [[Canada's Wonderland]], and [[Dreamworld (Australian theme park)|Dreamworld]] that featured shows, attractions and themes featuring Nickelodeon characters, all of which were wound down when [[CBS Corporation]] was given ownership of the theme parks in the Viacom/CBS split and eventually sold most of the properties to [[Cedar Fair]] without renewal of the Nickelodeon licensing agreements. The only Nickelodeon Central remaining in existence was at Dreamworld in [[Australia]], which is not under Cedar Fair ownership. The license was revoked in 2011 and became "Kid's World" and later DreamWorks Experience.
* '''[[Nickelodeon Blast Zone]]''' was an area in [[Universal Studios Hollywood]] that featured attractions inspired by Nickelodeon characters and themes. The four attractions that were present in the area were "Nickelodeon Splash", a waterpark-style area, "[[The Wild Thornberrys]] Adventure Temple," a jungle-themed foam ball play area, and "Nick Jr. Backyard," a medium-sized toddler playground. It ran from 2001 to 2007 and was rethemed as "The Adventures of [[Curious George]]" which closed in 2008 to make way for [[The Wizarding World of Harry Potter (Universal Studios Hollywood)]]. Adjacent to '''[[Nickelodeon Blast Zone]]''' was the "Panasonic Theatre" which housed another Nickelodeon attraction called "Totally Nickelodeon", which was an audience participated game show which ran from 1997 to 2000. "Rugrats Magic Adventure", opened 2001 but closed in 2002 to make way for [[Shrek 4-D]] which ran from May 2003 to August 2017. It closed to make way for [[DreamWorks Theatre]] Featuring Kung Fu Panda which opened on June 15, 2018.
* '''[[Nickelodeon Splat City]]''' was an area inside California's Great America (from 1995 to 2002), [[Kings Island]] (from 1995 to 2000) and Kings Dominion (from 1995 to 1999), that featured messy- and water-themed attractions. The slime refinery theme was carried out in the attractions such as the "Green Slime Zone Refinery", the "Crystal Slime Mining Maze", and the "Green Slime Transfer Truck." All of these areas were later transformed into either Nickelodeon Central or [[Kings Island|Nickelodeon Universe]] before being discontinued as mentioned above when sold off by CBS Corporation.
