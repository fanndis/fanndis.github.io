On June 27, 2016, Lynch and former President [[Bill Clinton]] met privately aboard Lynch's Justice Department jet while it was parked on the ramp in [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]]. [[KNXV-TV|ABC15 Phoenix]] reporter Christopher Sign broke the story on June 29, citing unnamed sources.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.abc15.com/news/region-phoenix-metro/central-phoenix/loretta-lynch-bill-clinton-meet-privately-in-phoenix|title=Loretta Lynch, Bill Clinton meet privately in Phoenix|first=Christopher|last=Sign|date=July 4, 2016|work=ABC15 News|access-date=July 2, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160712112340/http://www.abc15.com/news/region-phoenix-metro/central-phoenix/loretta-lynch-bill-clinton-meet-privately-in-phoenix|archive-date=July 12, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> The next day, during a press conference in Phoenix, Lynch denied the conversation was about the [[Hillary Clinton email controversy]] or any matters pertaining to it, saying the discussion instead involved personal social topics such as travels, golf, and grandchildren.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/06/29/politics/bill-clinton-loretta-lynch/index.html|title=Bill Clinton and AG Loretta Lynch meet privately|date=June 30, 2016|work=CNN}}</ref> On July 1, 2016, Lynch swore she would "fully accept" the recommendation of the FBI and prosecutors regarding the email probe, and admitted that she understood how the meeting was raising "questions and concerns", and that she "certainly wouldn't do it again".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/attorney-general-loretta-lynch-calls-perfectly-reasonable-question/story?id=40272091|title=Attorney General Loretta Lynch Calls It 'Perfectly Reasonable' to Question Bill Clinton Meeting|first=Mike|last=Levine|date=July 1, 2016|work=ABC News}}</ref> On July 6, a day after FBI Director [[James Comey]] recommended not pressing charges against Clinton, Lynch confirmed the Justice Department had opted to not pursue charges against Clinton and would close the probe into her private email server.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2016/07/attorney-general-loretta-lynch-says-doj-will-not-pursue-charges-against-clinton-225189|title=Attorney General Loretta Lynch says DOJ will not pursue charges against Clinton|date=July 6, 2016|work=Politico}}</ref> On July 12, Lynch testified before Republican lawmakers, on the legal basis of the Justice Department's choice to not prosecute Clinton.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2016/07/12/loretta-lynch-bill-clinton-meeting-hillary-clinton-emails/86951794/|title=GOP lawmakers grill attorney general over Clinton emails, get few answers|date=July 12, 2016|first=Donovan|last=Slack|work=USA Today}}</ref>

On June 8, 2017, former FBI head James Comey testified under oath that Lynch had instructed him (during the course of a private conversation) to not refer to the Clinton email scandal as an "investigation" and instead refer to it as a "matter". He also said that the directive, combined with Lynch's  ramp in Phoenix ramp with former President Clinton, led him to make his independent announcement regarding the Clinton email probe last July. In his closely watched Senate Intelligence Committee testimony, otherwise devoted to discussing the circumstances of his firing, Comey said that tarmac meeting was a "deciding factor" in his decision to act alone to update the public on the Clinton probe—and protect the Bureau's reputation.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/06/08/politics/james-comey-loretta-lynch/index.html|title=Comey: Lynch asked for Clinton investigation to be called a 'matter'|first=Tal |last=Kopan|date=June 8, 2017|work=CNN|access-date=August 14, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/06/08/comey-says-lynch-tarmac-meeting-directive-to-downplay-probe-prompted-him-to-go-rogue-on-clinton-case.html|title=Comey says Lynch tarmac meeting, directive to downplay probe prompted him to go rogue on Clinton case|first=Brooke|last=Singman|date=June 8, 2017|work=Fox News|access-date=August 14, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2017/06/08/comey-lynch-told-me-not-call-probe-clinton-emails-investigation/102629702/|title=Comey: Lynch told me not to call probe of Clinton emails an investigation|author=|date=June 8, 2017|work=USA Today|access-date=August 14, 2017}}</ref>
