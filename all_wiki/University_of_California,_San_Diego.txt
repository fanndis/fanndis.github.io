==History==
When the [[Regents of the University of California]] originally authorized the San Diego campus in 1956, it was planned to be a graduate and research institution, providing instruction in the sciences, mathematics, and engineering.<ref name="Kerr">{{Cite book | last=Kerr | first=Clark | title=The Gold and the Blue: A Personal Memoir of the University of California, 1949-1967 Volume I: Academic Triumphs | year=2003 | url=https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Gold_and_the_Blue_Volume_One/jMEZ_47vXkAC?hl=en&gbpv=1&pg=PA257&printsec=frontcover | pages=248, 254–260 | location=[[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]] | publisher=[[University of California Press]] | accessdate=July 20, 2009 | isbn=978-0-520-22367-7 }}</ref> Local citizens supported the idea, voting the same year to transfer to the university {{convert|59|acre|ha}} of mesa land on the coast near the preexisting [[Scripps Institution of Oceanography]]. The Regents requested an additional gift of {{convert|550|acre|ha}} of undeveloped mesa land northeast of Scripps, as well as {{convert|500|acres|ha}} on the former site of [[Camp Calvin B. Matthews|Camp Matthews]] from the federal government, but [[Roger Revelle]], then director of Scripps Institution and main advocate for establishing the new campus, jeopardized the site selection by exposing the La Jolla community's exclusive real estate business practices, which were antagonistic to minority racial and religious groups. This outraged local conservatives, as well as Regent [[Edwin W. Pauley]].<ref name=Kerr/> 

UC President [[Clark Kerr]] satisfied San Diego city donors by changing the proposed name from University of California, La Jolla, to University of California, San Diego.<ref name="Timeline"/><ref name=Kerr/> The city voted in agreement to its part in 1958, and the UC approved construction of the new campus in 1960. Because of the clash with Pauley, Revelle was not made chancellor. [[Herbert York]], first director of [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]], was designated instead.<ref name=Kerr/> York planned the main campus according to the "[[Oxbridge]]" model, relying on many of Revelle's ideas.<ref name="Stadtman1"/>

According to Kerr, "San Diego always asked for the best," though this created much friction throughout the UC system, including with Kerr himself, because UC San Diego often seemed to be "asking for too much and too fast."<ref name="Kerr" />  Kerr attributed UC San Diego's "special personality" to Scripps, which for over five decades had been the most isolated UC unit in every sense: geographically, financially, and institutionally.<ref name="Kerr" />  It was a great shock to the Scripps community to learn that Scripps was now expected to become the nucleus of a new UC campus and would now be the object of far more attention from both the university administration in Berkeley and the state government in Sacramento.<ref name="Kerr" />

UC San Diego was the first general campus of the University of California to be designed "from the top down" in terms of research emphasis.<ref name="ClarkKerr_Page257">{{cite book|last1=Kerr|first1=Clark|title=The Gold and the Blue: A Personal Memoir of the University of California, 1949–1967, Volume 1|date=2001|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=9780520223677|page=257|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jMEZ_47vXkAC&pg=PA257|accessdate=11 July 2020}}</ref> Local leaders disagreed on whether the new school should be a technical research institute or a more broadly based school that included undergraduates as well.

Nobel laureate [[Harold Urey]], a physicist from the [[University of Chicago]], and [[Hans Suess]], who had published the first paper on the [[greenhouse effect]] with Revelle in the previous year, were early recruits to the faculty in 1958.<ref name="Gribble"/> [[Maria Goeppert-Mayer]], later the second female [[List of Nobel laureates|Nobel laureate]] in physics, was appointed professor of physics in 1960.<ref name="Gribble"/> The graduate division of the school opened in 1960 with 20 faculty in residence, with instruction offered in the fields of [[physics]], [[biology]], [[chemistry]], and [[earth science]]. Before the main campus completed construction, classes were held in the Scripps Institution of Oceanography.<ref name="Stadtman1"/>

By 1963, new facilities on the mesa had been finished for the School of Science and Engineering, and new buildings were under construction for Social Sciences and Humanities. Ten additional faculty in those disciplines were hired, and the whole site was designated the First College, later renamed after [[Roger Revelle]], of the new campus. York resigned as chancellor that year and was replaced by [[John Semple Galbraith]].<ref name="Gribble"/> The undergraduate program accepted its first class of 181 freshman at [[Revelle College]] in 1964.<ref name="Stadtman1">{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/universityofcali00stad|url-access=registration|last=Stadtman |first=Verne A. |year=1970 |title=The University of California, 1868-1968|pages= [https://archive.org/details/universityofcali00stad/page/407 407]–411|publisher=[[McGraw-Hill]]|accessdate=May 5, 2013}}</ref><ref name="Stadtman">{{Cite journal |last=Stadtman |first=Verne A. |title=The Centennial Record of the University of California |year=1967 |publisher=[[Regents of the University of California]] |journal=Office of the Secretary

Early research activity and faculty quality, notably in the sciences, was integral to shaping the focus and culture of the university. Even before UC San Diego had its own campus, faculty recruits had already made significant research breakthroughs, such as the [[Keeling Curve]], a graph that plots rapidly increasing carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere and was the first significant evidence for global [[climate change]]; the [[Kohn–Sham equations]], used to investigate particular atoms and molecules in [[quantum chemistry]]; and the [[Miller–Urey experiment]], which gave birth to the field of [[Abiogenesis|prebiotic chemistry]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Briggs |first=Helen |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7120770.stm |title=50 years on: The Keeling Curve legacy |work=BBC News |date=December 2, 2007 |accessdate=February 20, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Miller |first=Stanley L. |author2=Harold C.

Under [[Richard C.

The transition period will run through the 2023–24 school year.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://ucsdguardian.org/2017/11/27/accepted-to-big-west-conference-ucsd-will-finally-be-a-division-i-school/|title=Accepted to Big West Conference, UCSD Will Finally Be a Division-I School|work=UCSD Guardian|access-date=November 27, 2017|language=en-US}}</ref> The university prepares to transition to [[NCAA Division I]] competition on July 1, 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ucsdnews.ucsd.edu/feature/division-one-here-we-come|title=Division One Here We Come|website=ucsdnews.ucsd.edu|access-date=2020-02-07}}</ref>

==Campus==

From left to right: [[Geisel Library]], Engineering Building Unit (EBU) I, the Powell-Focht Bioengineering Building, the Computer Science Building, and EBU II (visible through trees)}}

UC San Diego is located in the residential neighborhood of [[La Jolla]] of northern [[San Diego]], bordered by the communities of [[La Jolla Shores]], [[Torrey Pines, San Diego|Torrey Pines]], and [[University City, San Diego|University City]]. The main campus consists of 761 buildings that occupy {{convert|1152|acre|ha}}, with natural reserves covering about {{convert|889|acre|ha}} and outlying facilities taking up the remaining area.<ref name="Area"/> The [[Interstate 5 in California|San Diego Freeway]] passes through the campus and separates [[UC San Diego Health|Jacobs Medical Center]] and Mesa apartment housing from the greater part of the university. The [[Preuss School]], a college-preparatory [[charter school]] established and administered by UC San Diego, also lies on the eastern portion of the campus.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://preuss.ucsd.edu/about-preuss/index.html |title=About Preuss |work=[[Preuss School]] |publisher=University of California, San Diego |accessdate=July 16, 2009}}</ref>

Standing at the center of the university is the iconic [[Geisel Library]], named after [[Dr. Seuss]]. Library Walk, a heavily traveled pathway leading from the library to Gilman Drive, lies adjacent or close to [[Price Center]], Center Hall, International Center, and various student services buildings, including the Student Services Center and the Career Services building. The layout of the main campus centers on [[Geisel Library]], which is roughly surrounded by the seven residential colleges of [[Revelle College|Revelle]], [[John Muir College|Muir]], [[Thurgood Marshall College|Marshall]], [[Earl Warren College|Warren]], [[Eleanor Roosevelt College|Roosevelt]], [[Sixth College|Sixth]], [[Seventh College|Seventh]], and the [[University of California, San Diego School of Medicine|School of Medicine]]. The seven colleges maintain separate housing facilities for their students and each college's buildings are differentiated by distinct architectural styles. As residential colleges were added while the university expanded, buildings in newer colleges were designed with styles that were starkly different from that of the original campus. The disparate architectural styles led [[Travel + Leisure]], in its October 2013 issue, to name the university as one of the ugliest campuses in America, likening it to "a cupboard full of kitchen appliances whose function you can't quite fathom."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.travelandleisure.com/articles/americas-ugliest-college-campuses/7|title=America's Ugliest College Campuses|work=Travel + Leisure|date=October 2013|accessdate=September 19, 2014}}</ref>

The university has actively sought to reduce carbon emissions and energy usage on campus, earning a "gold" sustainability performance rating in the Sustainability Tracking Assessment and Rating System (STARS) survey. It was also praised in ''The Princeton Review's Guide to 322 Green Colleges: 2013 Edition'' for its strong commitment to sustainability in its academic offerings, campus infrastructure, activities and career preparation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ucsdnews.ucsd.edu/pressrelease/uc_san_diego_named_one_of_greenest_colleges_in_u.s._and_canada_by_princeton|title=UC San Diego Named One of Greenest Colleges in U.S. and Canada by Princeton Review|publisher=University of California, San Diego|date=April 24, 2013|accessdate=April 30, 2013}}</ref>

===Academic facilities===
[[File:Center Hall Front, UCSD.JPG|thumb|right|Center Hall, a lecture hall near the center of campus]]
When the campus opened in 1964, it consisted only of [[Revelle College]] and [[Scripps Institution of Oceanography]]. The school's rapid increase in enrollment and opening to undergraduate students over its first decade spurred major campus expansion. [[John Muir College|Muir]], [[Thurgood Marshall College|Marshall]], and [[Earl Warren College|Warren]] Colleges were established and built during the late 1960s through 1980s as the student population continued to grow considerably. Initially, the campus followed a rough north–south axis alongside [[U.S. Route 101 in California|Historic Route 101]], though construction in the following decades deviated from this, with the core of the campus shifting towards Geisel Library.<ref name="Timeline"/>

The school's two engineering departments were merged into the [[Jacobs School of Engineering|School of Engineering]] (renamed the Jacobs School of Engineering in 1987 in honor of Irwin Jacobs, founder of Qualcomm, and his wife Joan Jacobs) in 1982. New buildings have been continually added as the division expands. Major additions include: the [[San Diego Supercomputer Center]], completed in 1986; Powell-Focht Bioengineering Hall, completed in 2003; and the Structural and Materials Engineering building, completed in 2012.<ref name="Occupation"/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://facilities.ucsd.edu/NA/NamedBuildings/Building.htm?Bkey=593|title=Powell-Focht Bioengineering Hall|work=FacilitiesLink|publisher=University of California, San Diego|accessdate=April 29, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jacobsschool.ucsd.edu/news/news_releases/release.sfe?id=1254|title=Engineers, Visual Artists and Medical Device Researchers Work Large and Small in New UC San Diego Building|work=[[Jacobs School of Engineering]] |publisher=University of California, San Diego|date=September 5, 2012|accessdate=April 29, 2013}}</ref> Significant construction work on the previously undeveloped northern part of campus also took place during this time. Two graduate professional schools, the [[School of Global Policy and Strategy]] and [[Rady School of Management]], were constructed in the area adjacent to and near the Supercomputer Center, as well as [[Eleanor Roosevelt College|Roosevelt College]], a transfer student apartment complex called The Village at Torrey Pines, and the [[RIMAC (UC San Diego)|RIMAC]] athletic facilities.

=== Arts facilities ===
UC San Diego's Joan and Irwin Jacobs Theatre District, located just south of [[Revelle College]], houses the Mandell Weiss Center for the Performing Arts. The Center's facilities are shared with the [[La Jolla Playhouse]], a professional theatre which UC San Diego is partnered with. Specifically, four large performance venues are shared between the two organizations: the Mandell Weiss Forum, the [[Mandell Weiss Theatre]], the Sheila and Hughes Potiker Theatre, and the Theodore and Adele Shank Theatre. These venues, on top of hosting UC San Diego Theatre and Dance departmental undergraduate and graduate productions, often host award-winning professional productions of plays and musicals, some of which later transfer to [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]. Other theatre performance facilities at UC San Diego include the Molli and Arthur Wagner Dance Building, also located within the Theatre District, and the Arthur Wagner Theatre located in [[Revelle College]]'s Galbraith Hall.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://theatre.ucsd.edu/facilities/index.htm|title=Theatres & Facilities|website=theatre.ucsd.edu|access-date=2019-10-26}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://lajollaplayhouse.org/who-we-are/about-the-playhouse/|title=About the Playhouse|website=La Jolla Playhouse|language=en|access-date=2019-10-26}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://theatre.ucsd.edu/facilities/theatres/galbraith.htm|title=Theatres & Facilities - Galbraith Hall|website=theatre.ucsd.edu|access-date=2019-10-26}}</ref>

Other arts facilities include the 800-seat Mandeville Auditorium and [[Conrad Prebys Music Center]], used by UC San Diego's music department, as well as Mandeville Center, the Visual Arts Facilities (VAF) building, and the Structural and Material Engineerings (SME) building, used by UC San Diego's visual arts department.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://music-cms.ucsd.edu/about/facilities.html|title=Facilities|website=music-cms.ucsd.edu|access-date=2019-10-26}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://visarts.ucsd.edu/about/facilities.html|title=Facilities|website=visarts.ucsd.edu|access-date=2019-10-26}}</ref>

===Public art===
{{Further|Stuart Collection}}
[[File:Tim Hawkinsons Bear (8278974671).jpg|thumb|217x217px|Warren Bear ]]
More than a dozen public art projects, part of the [[Stuart Collection]], decorate the campus. Perhaps the most famous of these is the ''[[Sun God (statue)|Sun God]]'', a large winged creature located near the Faculty Club. Other collection pieces include a collection of [[Stonehenge]]-like stone blocks, a house sitting atop an engineering building in Warren College called ''[[Fallen Star]]'', a table by [[Jenny Holzer]], a building that flashes the names of vices and virtues in bright neon lights, and three metallic [[Eucalyptus]] trees. 

[[File:Snake Path, UCSD.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Image of the Snake Path taken from one of the upper floors in Geisel Library. |Snake Path, east of Geisel Library.]]
The collection also includes a large coiling snake path whose head guides towards Geisel Library, with a quote from [[John Milton]]'s ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' carved along its length: "And wilt thou not be loath to leave this Paradise, but shalt possess a Paradise within thee, happier far." The path circles around its own garden and a large granite book-shaped block. One of the newest additions to the collection is Tim Hawkinson's giant teddy bear made of six boulders located in between the newly constructed [[Calit2]] buildings.<ref name="Calit2">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/05/arts/05lab.html|title=Researchers Look to Create a Synthesis of Art and Science for the 21st century|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=February 3, 2008|last=Markhoff|first=John|date=November 5, 2005}}</ref> Another notable campus sight was the graffiti staircase of Mandeville Hall, a series of corridors that had been tagged with [[graffiti]] by generations of students over decades of use; this was recently replaced with the Graffiti Art Park.<ref name="Graffiti Art Park">{{cite web|url=http://artpark.ucsd.edu/about-the-park.html |title=About The Park |publisher=Artpark.ucsd.edu |date=February 3, 2014 |accessdate=April 9, 2016}}</ref> Students in the university's visual arts department also create temporary public art installations as part of their coursework.

[[Shepard Fairey]], most notable for his [[Barack Obama "Hope" poster]], painted a mural at the [[Ché Café]], one of UC San Diego's most famous buildings and collectives, on an outside wall facing Scholars Drive, that features the likenesses of [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] and other political figures. Underground street artist, Swampy, created a large piece inside the Ché Café, visible through the courtyard depicting his signature mammoth skeleton. Local San Diego artist Mario Torero, in collaboration with university art students, painted a mural at the Café in commemoration of Angela Davis and Rigoberta Menchú, along with other notable political figures. The Ché Café remains a hub for underground and politically progressive artists. Torero was invited back to the university in 2009 to create a mural called "Chicano Legacy" based on content suggested by [[Chicano]] students.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://ucsdnews.ucsd.edu/thisweek/2009/10/19_mural.asp |title=Students Welcomed to Campus by New Mural Celebrating Chicano History |newspaper=This Week @ UCSD |accessdate=January 1, 2010 |last=Clark |first=Christine |date=October 19, 2009}}</ref> The mural is a $10,000 digital image on a {{convert|15|by|50|ft|adj=on}} canvas mounted on the exterior of Peterson Hall, which includes representations of [[César Chávez]] and [[Dolores Huerta]] as well as the kiosk structure at [[Chicano Park]].<ref name=Berestein>{{cite news |url=http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2009/oct/13/celebration-culture/ |title=A celebration of culture |newspaper=[[U-T San Diego]] |accessdate=January 1, 2010 |last=Berestein |first=Leslie |date=October 13, 2009 }}</ref> In 2016 a mural entitled "Enduring Spell" was completed by El Mac in the Argo courtyard,<ref name="“Enduring Spell” by artist El Mac in San Diego">{{cite web |title="Enduring Spell" by El Mac in San Diego|url=http://www.streetartnews.net/2016/03/enduring-spell-el-mac-san-diego.html |website=StreetArtNews|accessdate=April 6, 2016|ref=elmac}}</ref>

The [[San Diego Association of Governments]] and the [[San Diego Metropolitan Transit System|Metropolitan Transit System]] are planning to bring [[San Diego Trolley]] service to the local area. The project will extend the existing [[Blue Line (San Diego Trolley)|<!--<span style="color:#0071bc;">-->Blue Line<!--</span>-->]] north to UC San Diego and the University City area from Downtown San Diego. The extension will give the university campus two trolley stations, East and West. There is also a proposed station at the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Veterans Administration]] hospital just south of UCSD. A major goal of the project is to ease traffic and parking on campus while providing more accessible transportation to nearby areas. Construction began in 2016, with service expected to begin in 2021. As part of UCSD's existing public transit partnerships, all students have unlimited access to MTS regional buses and trolleys, as well as most [[North County Transit District]] transportation services upon paying a "transportation fee" in registration.<ref name="Triton U-Pass">{{cite web|title=Triton U-Pass|url=http://u-pass.ucsd.edu |accessdate=February 2, 2015|ref=upass}}</ref>

=== Construction ===
Several facilities are currently under construction at the UC San Diego campus. The North Torrey Pines Living and Learning Neighborhood is partially completed, with students living in the completed facilities since Fall 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://plandesignbuild.ucsd.edu/projects/transforming/ntplln.html|title=North Torrey Pines Living and Learning Neighborhood|website=Planning, Design and Construction}}</ref> The Future College Living and Learning Neighborhood is scheduled for release in the Fall of 2023.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://plandesignbuild.ucsd.edu/projects/transforming/fclln.html|title=Future College Living and Learning Neighborhood|website=Planning, Design and Construction}}</ref> Other planned facilities in development or under construction include the Nuevo East Student Housing, Nuevo West Graduate Housing, Viterbi Family Eye Research Center, Design and Innovation Building, and Franklin Antonio Hall.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://plandesignbuild.ucsd.edu/projects/index.html|title=Projects|website=Planning, Design and Construction}}</ref>

There is also significant infrastructure construction, including the [[UCSD West/Pepper Canyon station|UCSD West]] and [[UCSD East/Voigt Drive station|UCSD East]] trolley stations, which will connect the campus to the [[Downtown San Diego]] area.

===Residential colleges===
UC San Diego's undergraduate division is organized into seven [[residential college]]s, each headed by its own [[Provost (education)|provost]]. They all set their own general education requirements, manage separate administrative and advising staff, and grant unique degrees. In chronological order by date of foundation, the seven colleges are:
# [[Revelle College]], founded in 1964 as First College, emphasizes a "Renaissance education" through the Humanities sequence which integrates history, literature, and philosophy. It has highly structured requirements.
# [[John Muir College]], founded in 1967 as Second College, emphasizes a "spirit of self-sufficiency and individual choice" and offers loosely structured general-education requirements.
# [[Thurgood Marshall College]], founded in 1970 as Third College, emphasizes "scholarship, social responsibility and the belief that a liberal arts education must include an understanding of one's role in society".
# [[Earl Warren College]], founded in 1974 as Fourth College, requires students to pursue a major of their choice while also requiring two "programs of concentration" in disciplines unrelated to each other and to their major "toward a life in balance".
# [[Eleanor Roosevelt College]], founded in 1988 as Fifth College, focuses its core education program on a cross-cultural interdisciplinary course sequence entitled "Making of the Modern World", has a foreign language requirement, and encourages studying abroad.
# [[Sixth College]], founded in 2001, has a focus on "historical and philosophical connections among culture, art and technology."
# [[Seventh College]], founded in 2020, enrolled its first cohort of students in Fall 2020, with the theme "A Changing Planet."

Students affiliate with a college based upon its particular philosophy and environment as majors are not exclusive to specific colleges. Revelle and Sixth enroll the largest number of undergraduate students, followed by Warren, Muir, Roosevelt, and Marshall.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://studentresearch.ucsd.edu/_files/stats-data/enroll/ugcoll.pdf |title=Undergraduates by College |work=Student Affairs |publisher=University of California, San Diego |accessdate=July 18, 2009}}</ref> Each undergraduate college sets different requirements for awarding graduation and provost's honors, separate from departmental and [[Phi Beta Kappa Society|Phi Beta Kappa]] honors.

===Governance===
{{Main|Regents of the University of California}}

The undergraduate student body government is the Associated Students of the University of California, San Diego, organized as a cabinet and senate,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://as.ucsd.edu |title=Associated Students of UCSD |publisher=University of California, San Diego |work=UC San Diego Associated Students |date=June 8, 2009 |accessdate=July 16, 2009}}</ref><ref>ASUCSD Minutes, December 16, 1964</ref> while graduate students are represented by the Graduate Student Association, a proportional representative body with membership depending on the number of students in each graduate department.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gsa.ucsd.edu/ |title=UCSD Graduate Student Association |publisher=University of California, San Diego |accessdate=July 16, 2009}}</ref> Additionally, graduate students who serve as teaching assistants are represented by the UC-wide union of Academic Student Employees. Each of the six residential colleges has its own [[student council]] as well. Most student media publications distributed on-campus are services provided and governed by ASUCSD, including Triton TV,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tritontv.com/ |title=Triton TV |publisher=University of California, San Diego |accessdate=April 30, 2013}}</ref> a film studio and TV station, and the [[KSDT Radio|KSDT radio station]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ksdt.ucsd.edu/ |title=KSDT |publisher=University of California, San Diego|accessdate=April 30, 2013}}</ref> A notable exception is ''[[UCSD Guardian|The Guardian]]'', which is directly governed by the university's Student Affairs department.

[[File:Price Center, UCSD.jpg|left|thumb|[[Price Center]]]]
[[Price Center]], often referred to as PC, is the main student hub and is located in the center of campus, just south of [[Geisel Library]]. The building houses multiple restaurants, the central bookstore, a movie theater, and office space for student organizations, organization advisers, and university faculty.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theuniversitycenters.ucsd.edu/aboutus.php |title=UCSD University Centers |publisher=University of California, San Diego |accessdate=May 3, 2013}}</ref> A student referendum was passed in 2003 to expand the Price Center to nearly double its original size.

There are also three campus centers that cultivate a sense of community among faculty, staff, and certain students: the [[multiculturalism|Cross-Cultural]] Center, the [[Gender|Women's Center]], and the [[LGBT]] Resource Center. UC San Diego was the last UC campus to have such centers. All three, especially the Cross-Cultural Center that was created first, were founded in the mid-1990s as a result of student movements that demanded change despite opposition by the campus administration.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ccc.ucsd.edu |title=Welcome to the Cross-Cultural Center |publisher=University of California, San Diego |work=Cross Cultural Center |accessdate=July 16, 2009}}</ref>

The Ché also acts as a resource for the music and art departments on campus through hosting art shows, performances, and film screenings. Some of the most notable touring bands or musicians who have played at the Ché include: [[Bon Iver]], [[Green Day]], [[Rise Against]], [[Jimmy Eat World]], [[Matt & Kim]], [[Billy Corgan]], [[Blonde Redhead]], [[Bomb the Music Industry!]], [[The Get Up Kids]], [[Deerhoof]], [[Bright Eyes (band)|Bright Eyes]], [[Chumbawamba]], [[Mike Watt]], [[Hella (band)|Hella]], [[Dan Deacon]], [[Unwound]], and [[Jawbreaker (band)|Jawbreaker]]. Prominent local San Diego bands such as [[The Locust]] and [[Pinback]], and national tours such as [[Mates of State]] and [[The Dillinger Escape Plan]] have given the [[Ché Café]] some fame and praise as a radical vegan collective despite its small size and limited sound equipment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thechecafe.blogspot.com/p/booking.html |title=Booking |work=[[Ché Café]] |publisher=University of California, San Diego |accessdate=April 30, 2013}}</ref>

===Traditions===
The student body government coordinates a wide variety of concerts and events during the year. UC San Diego begins the fall quarter with Welcome Week to introduce new students to campus clubs and activities,{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} starting the week with the All Campus Dance. The [[Hullabaloo (festival)|Hullabaloo]] music festival takes place every November as part of the university's Founders' Celebration. Bear Garden, a carnival held near Price Center, takes place every quarter throughout the year. Additionally, events are frequently held at the Loft, a performance lounge within Price Center.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://asce.ucsd.edu/about |title=About ASCE |work=AS Concerts & Events |publisher=University of California, San Diego |accessdate=April 29, 2013}}</ref> 

The [[Sun God Festival]], named after the [[Sun God (statue)|statue]] part of the [[Stuart Collection]], is the largest and most significant event of the year, held annually in mid-May on the seventh week of the spring quarter.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} The festival has grown over its 30-year history into a 20,000 person event, featuring an eclectic mix of art, dance, and musical performances. Past performers have included: [[Kendrick Lamar]], [[Porter Robinson]], [[Macklemore]], [[Silversun Pickups]], [[Wiz Khalifa]], [[Drake (entertainer)|Drake]], [[T.I.]], [[Third Eye Blind]], [[Ludacris]], [[Michelle Branch]], [[Sara Bareilles]], [[The Roots]], and [[My Chemical Romance]]. The 2017 festival featured [[ScHoolboy Q]], [[DJ Mustard]], [[Bad Suns]], Manila Killa and [[Khalid (singer)|Khalid]].<ref name="sungod16">{{cite news|last1=To|first1=Jacky|title=ASCE Reveals Secret Sun God Artist: Louis the Child |url=http://ucsdguardian.org/2016/04/25/asce-reveals-secret-sun-god-artist-louis-the-child/|accessdate=March 28, 2017|work=UCSD Guardian|date=April 25, 2016|ref=ASCE Reveals Secret Sun God Artist: Louis the Child}}</ref>

Two other popular campus traditions are the Pumpkin Drop and the Watermelon Drop, which take place during [[Halloween]] and at the end of the spring [[academic quarter (year division)|quarter]], respectively.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.10news.com/news/47th-annual-giant-watermelon-drop-held-at-ucsd |title=47th Annual Giant Watermelon Drop Held At UCSD |work=ABC News |date=June 3, 2011 |accessdate=May 3, 2013}}</ref> The Watermelon Drop is one of the campus' oldest traditions, famously originating in 1965 from a physics exam question centering on the velocity on impact of a dropped object. A group of intrigued students pursued that line of thought by dropping a watermelon from the top floor of Revelle's Urey Hall to measure the distance from the splat to the farthest travelling piece of fruit. A variety of events surround the Watermelon Drop, including a pageant where an occasionally male but generally female "Watermelon Queen" is elected. The Pumpkin Drop is a similar event celebrated by the dropping of a large, candy-filled pumpkin from 11-story Tioga Hall, the tallest residential building on the Muir college campus.

===Housing===
The six undergraduate residential colleges have separate, unique housing facilities for their students. First-year students are usually housed in the residence halls while upperclassmen live in the college apartments. Transfer students are housed in separate facilities from the residential colleges, in an area adjacent to Eleanor Roosevelt College called The Village at Torrey Pines.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hdh.ucsd.edu/thevillage/ |title=UC San Diego Transfer Student Housing at The Village |work=UC San Diego Housing |publisher=University of California, San Diego |accessdate=April 30, 2013}}</ref> The housing facilities vary in design, though nearly all of them are of [[Modern architecture|modern]] or [[Brutalist architecture|brutalist]] style. The vast majority of entering freshmen and about 40 percent of all undergraduates in Fall 2012 chose to live in campus residence halls or apartments,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://studentresearch.ucsd.edu/sriweb/UCSDCollegeProfile.pdf |title=UC San Diego College Portrait |work=Student Research and Information |publisher=University of California, San Diego |accessdate=April 30, 2013}}</ref> with roughly 70 percent of all incoming freshmen living in triple-occupancy rooms. Graduate students can choose to live in one of six apartment complexes apart from undergraduate housing.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} Three of these facilities are several minutes away from UC San Diego while the remaining are located on university grounds.

Accommodations are made for students with specific needs.

Reflecting UC San Diego's diversity, International House, a complex of apartments located in Eleanor Roosevelt College, is dedicated to cross-cultural exchange between American and international students, housing about 350 students from more than 30 countries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ihouse.ucsd.edu/about/index.html|title=About Us |work=International House |publisher=University of California, San Diego |accessdate=February 20, 2012}}</ref> International learning is fostered through formal programs including current affairs discussions, cultural nights, and a community newsletter. Upper-division undergraduates from all six colleges, graduate students, faculty, and researchers are eligible to live in International House, located in the Eleanor Roosevelt College townhouses. Demand is very high for this special program and there is often a waitlist. Spaces in International House are not guaranteed and admission requires a separate application.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hdh.ucsd.edu/housing/location.asp |title=The Six Colleges and La Jolla Living |work=UC San Diego Housing |publisher=University of California, San Diego |accessdate=February 20, 2013}}</ref>

Housing plans also offer students access to dining facilities, which were named by [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals|PETA]] as the most [[Vegan|vegan-friendly]] in the United States.<ref>{{cite news|title=PETA names UCSD most 'vegan-friendly' large school in the United States |date=November 15, 2012 |publisher=Southwest Riverside News Network |url=http://www.swrnn.com/2012/11/15/peta-names-ucsd-most-vegan-friendly-large-school-in-the-united-states/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130203150556/http://www.swrnn.com/2012/11/15/peta-names-ucsd-most-vegan-friendly-large-school-in-the-united-states/ |url-status=dead|archive-date=February 3, 2013|work=City News Service |accessdate=November 16, 2012}}</ref> Each student is allotted a certain number of "Dining Dollars" to purchase meals at any dining hall and groceries at any on-campus market. Six distinct dining halls are located at each of the six colleges, with markets located adjacent or near them, except at Eleanor Roosevelt College which shares a marketplace with The Village. In addition to the six dining halls, there are also four specialty dining facilities and two food trucks on campus that accept dining dollars. UC San Diego currently offers two years guaranteed housing to both its incoming freshmen and its incoming transfer students.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://housing.ucsd.edu/faq.asp#guarantee|title=HDH Search |website=housing.ucsd.edu|accessdate=August 11, 2018}}</ref>

On November 27, 2017, the university announced that its athletic programs have begun a 6-year transition process from [[NCAA Division II]] to [[NCAA Division I|Division I]], where it will be a member of the [[Big West Conference]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://ucsdnews.ucsd.edu/pressrelease/division1|title=UC San Diego to Join NCAA Division I Big West Conference |website=ucsdnews.ucsd.edu|access-date=November 27, 2017}}</ref> As of 2017 most of UC San Diego's 23 intercollegiate varsity athletic teams still participate in Division II, 12-member [[California Collegiate Athletic Association]], and some compete independently.

Until 2007, UC San Diego was the only Division II school that did not offer athletic [[scholarship]]s. In 2005, the NCAA created a rule that made it mandatory for all D-II programs to award athletic grants. Consequently, a measure was proposed to begin offering $500 "grants-in-aid" to all 600 intercollegiate athletes in order to meet this requirement. A student [[referendum]] was passed in February 2007, authorizing a $329 annual student fee to fund a raise in coaches' salaries, hire more trainers, and provide all athletes with a $500 scholarship.<ref name="Yang Su">{{cite news |url=http://www.utsandiego.com/uniontrib/20070203/news_7m3ucsd.html |title=Athletic fee hike approved at UCSD|last=Yang Su |first=Eleanor|date=February 3, 2007|newspaper=[[U-T San Diego]] |accessdate=July 22, 2009}}</ref>

The athletic department considered a move to Division I in 2011. The student body would have needed to approve a doubling of student fees to allow the university to meet minimum scholarship requirements for D-I participation. However, students overwhelmingly rejected this measure in 2012, halting any efforts for a move to Division I at that time.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.lajollalight.com/2012/03/27/uc-san-diego’s-move-to-division-i-gets-‘no’-vote/|title=UC San Diego's move to Division I gets 'no' vote|last=Dailey|first=Phil|date=March 27, 2012|newspaper=La Jolla Light|accessdate=May 3, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130523010544/http://www.lajollalight.com/2012/03/27/uc-san-diego%E2%80%99s-move-to-division-i-gets-%E2%80%98no%E2%80%99-vote/|archive-date=May 23, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>

On May 24, 2016, students at UC San Diego passed the vote to move their athletics to [[NCAA Division I]]. The school's newspaper, ''The Guardian,'' reported that voter turnout was 35 percent of the undergraduate population, when the measure only needed 20 percent to pass.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nbcsandiego.com/news/local/UCSD-Division-I-Vote-Students-380696221.html |title=UC San Diego Students Vote to Take All Sports to Division I |last=NBC 7 staff |newspaper=NBC San Diego |date=May 24, 2016|accessdate=May 29, 2016}}</ref>
