'''Tracy Ann Austin Holt''' (born December 12, 1962<ref>https://www.tennisfame.com/hall-of-famers/inductees/tracy-austin</ref>) is an American former [[List of WTA number 1 ranked players|World No. 1]] professional [[tennis]] player. She won three [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] titles; the women's singles titles at the 1979 and 1981 [[US Open (tennis)|US Open]]s, and the mixed doubles title at the [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon Championships]] in 1980. Additionally, she won the [[WTA Tour Championships]] in 1980 and the year-ending [[Toyota Championships]] in 1981, both in singles. A series of injuries and a serious automobile accident cut short her career. She is the youngest US Open female singles champion in history, and she is the youngest inductee into the [[International Tennis Hall of Fame]] in history at age 29.  Austin won singles titles on all playing surfaces: clay (both red clay and green clay), indoor carpet, grass, and hard courts.

==Playing style==
{{BLP unsourced section|date=July 2014}}

Austin possessed a solid baseline game, with a strong forehand and reliable two-fisted backhand. She struck the ball deep, with substantial pace (given the wooden racquet era of her prime), and with pinpoint accuracy, hitting on or near the lines. Often this aspect of her game has overshadowed her solid net game which resulted in a [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]] [[mixed doubles (tennis)|mixed doubles]] title with her brother John. Austin's first serve was a mid-paced high percentage shot that functioned well on all playing surfaces, and although her second serve has been described as lacking penetration, she rarely double faulted. She played an exhibition doubles match at age 12 in Claremont, Ca with [[Elgin Baylor]], [[Lawrence Mc Cuthcheon]], and [[Lea Antonoplis]].

==Career==

===1977 to 1980===
She won the women's singles in the [[Ojai Tennis Tournament]] in 1977.<ref>[http://ojaitourney.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Past_Champions-070513.pdf]</ref>

Austin turned professional in October 1978.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=asstAAAAIBAJ&sjid=V6EFAAAAIBAJ&pg=1202%2C1738524 | title=Tracy Austin now a pro | publisher=[[The Montreal Gazette]] | date=October 20, 1978 | agency=[[Reuters]] | page=21 | via=[[Google News Archive]]}}</ref> That same month, she won her first professional singles title, defeating [[Betty Stöve]] in the final of the [[1978 Porsche Tennis Grand Prix|Porsche Tennis Grand Prix]] in Filderstadt, West Germany.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=rs5aAAAAIBAJ&sjid=JHwDAAAAIBAJ&pg=5403%2C3827664 | title=Tracy Austin plans to play at East Lake | author=Jack Ellison | work=[[St. Petersburg Times]] | date=October 20, 1978 | page=3C | via=[[Google News Archive]]}}</ref><ref name="dolan2011">{{cite book | title=Women's Tennis 1968–84: the Ultimate Guide | year=2011 | publisher=Remous | pages=292, 307 | author=John Dolan}}</ref>

Austin defeated 35-year-old [[Billie Jean King]] in the quarterfinals of the [[1979 Wimbledon Championships – Women's Singles|1979 Wimbledon Championships]], then lost to [[Martina Navratilova]] in straight sets in the semifinals. Austin then became the youngest ever U.S. Open champion, aged 16 years and 9 months, by defeating Navratilova in the semifinals and [[Chris Evert]] in the final. Evert had been attempting to win the title for the fifth consecutive year. Earlier that year, Austin ended Evert's 125-match winning streak on clay by beating her 6–4, 2–6, 7–6 in a semifinal of the [[1979 Italian Open (tennis)|Italian Open]]. The Associated Press named Austin its [[Associated Press Athlete of the Year|Female Athlete of the Year]] for 1979.

Austin lost in the semifinals of both Grand Slam tournaments she played in 1980. [[Evonne Goolagong Cawley]], seeded fourth and the eventual champion, defeated Austin at the [[1980 Wimbledon Championships – Women's Singles|Wimbledon Championships]]. As the top seed and defending champion at the [[1980 US Open – Women's Singles|US Open]], Austin was expected to extend her five-match winning streak against third-ranked Evert. Austin took a 4–0 lead in the first set before Evert won 16 of the final 20 games to win the match. Evert went on to beat [[Hana Mandlíková]] in the final. Austin was ranked the World No. 1 singles player in 1980 for two weeks (April 7–20) and then for 19 weeks (July 7-November 17), partly because she captured the two sponsors' tour-ending events. Austin defeated Navratilova to win the [[1980 Avon Championships|Avon Championships]] in March and [[Andrea Jaeger]] to capture the [[1980 Colgate Series Championships]] in January 1981. In 1980, Austin won the [[1980 Wimbledon Championships – Mixed Doubles|Wimbledon mixed doubles title]] with her brother [[John Austin (tennis)|John]], becoming the first brother and sister team to win a Grand Slam title together.

===1981 to 1983===
During the first four months of 1981, Austin played only two events because of chronic injuries. On [[grass court|grass]], she won the [[Eastbourne International|BMW Championships]] in Eastbourne, United Kingdom without losing a set. After Wimbledon, Austin won 26 consecutive matches and four consecutive tournaments. She defeated Pam Shriver in the final of the [[Southern California Open|Wells Fargo Open]] in San Diego, and three weeks later, she beat both Navratilova and Evert in straight sets to win the [[Canadian Open (tennis)|Canadian Open]] in Toronto. As the third-seeded player at the [[1981 US Open – Women's Singles|US Open]], Austin defeated fourth-seeded Navratilova in the final. Navratilova, however, ended Austin's winning streak in the final of the [[US Indoors|U.S. Indoor Championships]]. In Europe during the autumn, Austin lost to [[Sue Barker]] in the quarterfinals of the [[Brighton International]] in Brighton, United Kingdom, but recovered the following week to defeat Navratilova in the final of the [[1981 Porsche Tennis Grand Prix|Porsche Tennis Grand Prix]] in Stuttgart, West Germany. At the final Grand Slam tournament of the year, Austin was seeded second but lost to sixth-seeded Shriver in the [[1981 Australian Open – Women's Singles|Australian Open]] quarterfinals. The 1981 year-ending [[1981 Toyota Series Championships|Toyota Series Championships]] featured two matches against Evert and one against Navratilova. Evert won her round robin match with Austin, then Austin defeated Evert in their semifinal. Austin then won the tournament with a three-set defeat of Navratilova. The Associated Press named Austin its 1981 Female Athlete of the Year for the second time.

Austin was the first opponent of [[Steffi Graf]] when the German made her professional debut at the [[1982 Porsche Tennis Grand Prix]] in Stuttgart. Austin defeated the 13-year-old Graf 6–4, 6–0.

Back injuries and recurring [[sciatica]] then began to impair Austin's effectiveness and sidelined her for long stretches. Billie Jean King, seeded twelfth, upset third-seeded Austin in the [[1982 Wimbledon Championships – Women's Singles|1982 Wimbledon]] quarterfinals. Several weeks later, however, Austin won her 30th and final top-level singles title in San Diego. Austin had a good showing at the 1982 season-ending Toyota Series Championships where she defeated Jaeger, the World No. 3, in straight sets to reach the semifinals. However, she was unable to repeat 1981's victory over Evert, who defeated her in the semifinals.

In 1983, she was the runner-up at the [[Charleston Open|Family Circle Cup]], losing the final to Navratilova in three sets. She also reached the quarterfinals of the [[1983 French Open – Women's Singles|French Open]].

===1984 to 1989===
Austin played sporadically from 1984-87 and tried yet another comeback on the tour in 1988 when she played in seven doubles tournaments, and in 1989, when she played in one doubles and two singles tournaments. A highlight of this comeback included a semifinal showing in the 1988 [[US Open (tennis)|US Open]] [[Mixed doubles (tennis)|mixed doubles]] with partner [[Ken Flach]].<ref name="ITF profile">{{cite web | last=Statistics | title=Tracy Austin | url=https://www.itftennis.com/procircuit/players/player/profile.aspx?PlayerID=20002127 | publisher=International Tennis Federation | accessdate=March 9, 2013}}</ref> This comeback was ended by a near-fatal motor vehicle accident on August 3, 1989.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.adelaidenow.com.au/lifestyle/sa-lifestyle/grand-slam-ended-tracy-austins-career/news-story/9f3769c55f74e1f5341b7be8ac5c46ce|title=Grand Slam ended career|date=2013-12-06|website=www.adelaidenow.com.au|language=en|access-date=2019-03-26}}</ref>

===1992===
In 1992, Austin became the youngest person to be inducted into the [[International Tennis Hall of Fame]], at the age of 29.

===1993 to 1994===
She attempted a second comeback in 1993 and 1994 but was not particularly successful. In 1993, Austin upset Rennae Stubbs and [[Katerina Maleeva]] at the [[BNP Paribas Open|Evert Cup]] in Indian Wells, California, then lost to [[Stephanie Rottier]]. At the WTA Manhattan Beach event, she upset [[Gigi Fernández]] and [[Elena Likhovtseva]], then lost to Gabriela Sabatini in the round of 16.  he wins over Maleeva, Fernandez, and Likhovtseva began a buzz that Austin might become at least a top 20 player again. However, in 1994, her results were not as promising and at the [[BNP Paribas Open|Evert Cup]] in Indian Wells, California, Austin lost in the second round to [[Steffi Graf]], and Austin soon retired in June 1994.<ref name = ITF_profile>{{cite web|last=Statistics|title=Tracy Austin|url=http://www.itftennis.com/procircuit/players/player/profile.aspx?PlayerID=20002127|publisher=International Tennis Federation|accessdate=March 9, 2013}}</ref>

==Family life and work as a tennis commentator==
Austin's older sister [[Pam Austin|Pam]] and her brothers [[Jeff Austin (tennis)|Jeff]], Doug and [[John Austin (tennis)|John]] were professional tennis players. She is the sister-in-law of fitness author [[Denise Austin]], who is married to Jeff. She is married to Scott Holt and is the mother of three sons: Sean, Brandon, and Dylan. Brandon currently is a member of the [[USC Tennis team]], recruited by Coach Peter Smith.

As a child, Austin lived next door to Air Force Colonel [[Keith Lindell]], who was responsible for the training of the original seven [[Project Mercury]] astronauts.

Since retiring as a player, Austin has worked as a commentator for NBC and the USA Network for the French Open and the US Open. During the 2000s, she worked for the Seven Network, which broadcast the Australian Open and usually participates in the BBC's Wimbledon coverage. She began working for the [[Tennis Channel]] in 2010 and joined its US Open team and later its [[Australian Open]] team in 2012. Austin has worked for Canadian television for its coverage of the [[Rogers Cup (tennis)|Rogers Cup]] since 2004.

Austin is the focus of [[David Foster Wallace]]'s "How Tracy Austin Broke My Heart" (1992), a book review of Austin's memoir ''Beyond Center Court'', lacerating the work for using generic, bland clichés of sports autobiographies to hide the genuinely compelling and tragic story of Austin's career.
