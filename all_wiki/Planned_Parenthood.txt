=== Origins ===

[[File:MargaretSanger-Underwood.LOC.jpg|thumb|right|[[Margaret Sanger]] (1922), the first president and founder of Planned Parenthood]]

The origins of Planned Parenthood date to October 16, 1916, when [[Margaret Sanger]], her sister [[Ethel Byrne]], and [[Fania Mindell]] opened the [[first birth control clinic in the U.S.]] in the [[Brownsville, Brooklyn|Brownsville]] section of the [[New York City|New York]] borough of [[Brooklyn]].<ref name="goldberg 2012">{{cite news |last1 = Goldberg |first1 = Michelle |title = Awakenings: On Margaret Sanger |url = http://www.thenation.com/article/awakenings-margaret-sanger/ |access-date = November 5, 2015 |work = The Nation |date = February 7, 2012 }}</ref> They distributed birth control, birth control advice, and birth control information.

The so-called Brownsville trials brought national attention and support to their cause. Sanger and her co-defendants were convicted on [[misdemeanor]] charges, which they appealed through two subsequent appeals courts. While the convictions were not overturned,<ref name="people v sanger">"People v. Sanger", 179 App. Div. 939, 166 N.Y.S. 1107 (1917)</ref> the judge who issued the final ruling also modified the law to permit physician-prescribed birth control.

The BCCRB merged with the ABCL in 1939 to form the Birth Control Federation of America (BCFA). In 1942 the name of the BCFA was changed to the Planned Parenthood Federation of America.<ref name=":2" />

=== 1940s – 1960s ===
Under the leadership of National Director [[D.&nbsp;Kenneth Rose]], the PPFA expanded its programs and services through the 1940s, adding affiliate organizations throughout the country. By the end of World War II, the Federation was no longer solely a center for birth control services or a clearing house for contraceptive information but had emerged as a major national health organization. PPFA's programs included a full range of family planning services including marriage education and counseling, and infertility services. The leadership of the PPFA, largely consisting of businessmen and male physicians, endeavored to incorporate its contraceptive services unofficially into regional and national public health programs by emphasizing less politicized aspects such as child spacing.<ref name=":2" />

During the 1950s, the Federation further adjusted its programs and message to appeal to a family-centered, more conservative post war populace, while continuing to function, through its affiliated clinics, as the more reliable source of contraceptives in the country.<ref name=":2" />

From 1942 to 1962, PPFA concentrated its efforts on strengthening its ties to affiliates, expanding public education programs, and improving its medical and research work. By 1960, visitors to PPFA centers across the nation numbered over 300,000 per year.<ref name=":2" />

Largely relying on a volunteer workforce, by 1960 the Federation had provided family planning counseling in hundreds of communities across the country.<ref name="encyclopedia" /> Planned Parenthood was one of the founding members of the [[International Planned Parenthood Federation]] when it was launched at a conference in [[Bombay]] (now Mumbai), [[India]], in 1952.<ref name="encyclopedia" /><ref name="malthus">{{cite web |url = https://www.academia.edu/28816392 |title = "The Hour of Malthus Has Struck": The Foundation of the International Planned Parenthood Federation and Discourses of International Family Planning |author = Sara Weydner |work = academia.edu |access-date = October 30, 2015 }}</ref>

In 1961 the population crisis debate, along with funding shortages, convinced PPFA to merge with the World Population Emergency Campaign, a citizens fund-raising organization to become PPFA-World Population.<ref name=":2" />

Both Planned Parenthood and Margaret Sanger are strongly associated with the abortion issue today.<ref>{{cite web |url = https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/protect-womens-health/ |title = Political Attacks on Planned Parenthood Are a Threat to Women's Health |publisher = Scientific American |access-date = January 2, 2017 }}</ref><ref name="Wayne">Wayne, T.

Planned Parenthood began to advocate abortion law reform beginning in 1955, when the organization's medical director, [[Mary Calderone]], convened a national conference of medical professionals on the issue. The conference was the first instance of physicians and other professionals advocating reform of the laws which criminalized abortion, and it played a key role in creating a movement for the reform of abortion laws in the U.S.<ref name="Reagan">Reagan, Leslie J. 1997.

== Before the U.S. Supreme Court ==

[[File:Roevwade.jpg|thumb|right|Former Planned Parenthood President [[Gloria Feldt]] with Congressman [[Albert Wynn]] in front of the U.S. Supreme Court]]

Planned Parenthood regional chapters have been active in the American courts. A number of cases in which Planned Parenthood has been a party have reached the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]]. Notable among these cases is the 1992 case ''[[Planned Parenthood v. Casey]]'', the case that sets forth the current constitutional abortion standard. In this case, "Planned Parenthood" was the Southeast Pennsylvania Chapter, and "Casey" was [[Robert P. Casey|Robert Casey]], the governor of [[Pennsylvania]]. The ultimate ruling was split, and ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'' was narrowed but upheld in an opinion written by [[Sandra Day O'Connor]], [[Anthony Kennedy]], and [[David Souter]]. [[Harry Blackmun]] and [[John Paul Stevens]] concurred with the main decision in separately written opinions. The Supreme Court struck down spousal consent requirements for married women to obtain abortions, but found no "undue burden"—an alternative to [[strict scrutiny]], which tests the allowable limitations on rights protected under the Constitution—from the other statutory requirements. Dissenting were [[William Rehnquist]], [[Antonin Scalia]], [[Clarence Thomas]], and [[Byron White]]. Blackmun, Rehnquist, and White were the only justices who voted on the original ''Roe v. Wade'' decision in 1973 who were still on the Supreme Court to rule on this case, and their votes on this case were consistent with their votes on the original decision that legalized abortion.<ref name="penn v casey">{{cite web |url = http://straylight.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0505_0833_ZS.html |title = Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v.

Critics of Planned Parenthood often refer to Sanger's connection with supporters of eugenics to discredit the organization by associating it, and birth control, with the more negative modern view of eugenics.<ref name="a racist">{{cite journal |last = Valenza |first = Charles |title = Was Margaret Sanger a Racist? |journal = Family Planning Perspectives |date = January–February 1985 |volume = 17 |issue = 1 |pages = 44–46 |url = http://chaztv.squarespace.com/storage/Margaret%20Sanger%20CV.pdf |access-date = August 6, 2011 |pmid = 3884362 |doi = 10.2307/2135230 |jstor = 2135230 }}</ref><ref name="bomberger again">{{cite news |last = Chamlee |first = Virginia |title = Bomberger again lashes out at NPR, Veazey |url = http://floridaindependent.com/40946/bomberger-again-lashes-out-at-npr-veazey |access-date = August 6, 2011 |newspaper = The Florida Independent |date = July 27, 2011 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110911154543/http://floridaindependent.com/40946/bomberger-again-lashes-out-at-npr-veazey |archive-date = September 11, 2011 |url-status = dead |df = mdy-all }}</ref> Planned Parenthood has responded to this effort directly in a leaflet acknowledging that Sanger agreed with some of her contemporaries who advocated the voluntary hospitalization or sterilization of people with untreatable, disabling, or hereditary conditions, and limits on the immigration of the diseased. The leaflet also states that Planned Parenthood "finds these views objectionable and outmoded" but says that it was compelled to discuss the topic because "anti-family planning activists continue to attack Sanger{{nbsp}}[...] because she is an easier target" than Planned Parenthood.<ref name="opposition claims">{{cite web |title = Opposition Claims About Margaret Sanger |url = https://www.plannedparenthood.org/files/8013/9611/6937/Opposition_Claims_About_Margaret_Sanger.pdf |publisher = Planned Parenthood |access-date = November 5, 2015 }}</ref>

=== Abortion ===

Planned Parenthood has occupied a central position in the [[abortion debate]] in the U.S., and has been among the most prominent targets of the [[United States pro-life movement|U.S. pro-life movement]] for decades. Some members of Congress, overwhelmingly [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], have attempted since the 1980s to end federal funding of the organization,<ref name="thorn" /> nearly leading to a government shutdown over the issue in 2011.<ref name="budget shutdown">{{cite news |last1 = Dwyer |first1 = Devin |title = Planned Parenthood at Center of Budget Shutdown Threat |url = https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/planned-parenthood-center-budget-shutdown-threat/story?id=13328750 |access-date = March 5, 2015 |publisher = ABC News |date = April 8, 2011 }}</ref> Planned Parenthood has consistently maintained that federal money received by Planned Parenthood is not used to fund abortion services, but pro-life activists have argued that the federal funding frees up other resources that are, in turn, used to provide abortions.<ref name="thorn" />

Planned Parenthood is the largest single provider of abortions in the U.S.,<ref name="yahoo.com">{{cite web |url = http://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/planned-parenthood-abortion-and-the-budget-fight/ |title = Planned Parenthood, abortion and the budget fight |work = Seattle Times |date = April 8, 2011 |access-date = November 3, 2012 }}</ref> but [[Abortion-rights movements|pro-choice]] advocates have argued that the organization's family planning services reduce the need for abortions; in the words of Megan Crepeau of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', Planned Parenthood could be "characterized as America's largest abortion preventer".<ref name="bait and switch">{{cite news |url = http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2011-04-04/news/ct-oped-0404-reproduction-20110404_1_fiscal-responsibility-cervical-cancer-screenings-planned-parenthood |title = The great Republican bait-and-switch |last = Crepeau |first = Megan |date = April 4, 2011 |work = Chicago Tribune }}</ref><ref name="texas says">* Finn, Robin, "Anti-Abortion Advocates?
