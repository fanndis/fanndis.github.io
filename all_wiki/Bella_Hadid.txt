=== Religion and politics ===
In January 2017, Hadid attended the "No Ban, No Wall" march in New York City, saying in an interview it was her own family history that drove her to participate in the march: "I come from a really diverse background. I've had incredible experiences all over the world… and I've learned that we're all just people, and we all deserve respect and kindness. We shouldn't treat people as if they don't deserve kindness just because of their ethnicities. It's just not right."<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.elle.com/fashion/celebrity-style/news/a42682/bella-hadid-protest-interview/|title=Bella Hadid on DKNY and Protesting in New York City|date=February 6, 2017|work=ELLE|access-date=March 25, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170326052257/http://www.elle.com/fashion/celebrity-style/news/a42682/bella-hadid-protest-interview/|archivedate=March 26, 2017|url-status=live|language=en|df=mdy-all}}</ref>
