===The Currys===
[[File:Camp Curry 1921 2.jpg|thumb|left|David and Jennie Curry's ad for the "Firefall"]]

David and Jennie Curry were schoolteachers who arrived in Yosemite Valley in 1899.<ref name=Wuerthner1994 /> The couple ran a tent camp in the valley<ref name=Kaufman2006 /> and, despite the two-week round-trip journey via horse and wagon from [[Merced, California]], the camp registered 292 guests in its first year.<ref name="Taylor1948">{{cite book|author=Katherine Ames Taylor|title=Yosemite Trails and Tales|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0HCmAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA77|year=1948|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=978-0-8047-4098-2|pages=77–}}</ref>  The Curry Company went on to dominate the politics of the park for decades, and David wrote the Secretary of the Interior, [[Franklin Lane]], in an effort to extend the park's tourist season so as to expand his business.<ref name="Wuerthner1994">{{cite book|author=George Wuerthner|title=Yosemite: A Visitor's Companion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wLNIty6rCKsC&pg=PA40|year=1994|publisher=Stackpole Books|isbn=978-0-8117-2598-9|pages=40–}}</ref>  In the Currys' opinion, national parks were for recreational use,<ref name="Scott2006">{{cite book|author=Amy Scott|title=Yosemite: Art of an American Icon|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2BNdexGoHkkC&pg=PA160|year=2006|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-24922-6|pages=160–}}</ref> and the couple marketed the park with attractions like the [[Firefall (event)|Firefall]].<ref name=Browning2005 />

David Curry died in 1917 and left the management of Camp Curry to his widow Jennie, who was then known as "Mother Curry". She received help from her children, particularly her daughter Mary, and Mary's husband [[Donald Tresidder]].<ref name="Kaufman2006">{{cite book|author=Polly Welts Kaufman|title=National Parks and the Woman's Voice: A History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yZ88rCE0Il4C&pg=PA8|year=2006|publisher=UNM Press|isbn=978-0-8263-3994-2|pages=8–}}</ref>  The camp still exists today as [[Curry Village]].

===Yosemite Park Company===
In 1915, [[Stephen T. Mather]] convinced D.J. Desmond to convert an old army barracks into the [[Yosemite Lodge]]. Desmond also began a hotel at Glacier Point the following year, while buying out a number of businesses to improve Yosemite Park Company's position in upcoming park leasing contracts.<ref name="Carr2007">{{cite book|author=Ethan Carr|title=Mission 66: Modernism and the National Park Dilemma|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EPPHQsmho3sC&pg=PA230|year=2007|publisher=Univ of Massachusetts Press|isbn=978-1-55849-587-6|pages=230–}}</ref> A congressional act permitted this efficient supervision of the park for the enjoyment of the public.<ref name="Sherow1998">{{cite book|author=James Earl Sherow|title=A Sense of the American West: An Anthology of Environmental History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1z1xY3TwHS0C&pg=PA162|year=1998|publisher=UNM Press|isbn=978-0-8263-1913-5|pages=162–}}</ref>  However, prominent tourists were refusing to stay at the park due to the poor conditions of the facilities<ref name=Association2003 /> (socialite [[Lady Astor]] reportedly described the Sentinel Hotel as "primitive"<ref name=Scott2006 />), and in 1916 the newly formed [[National Park Service]] began a concerted effort to attract visitors to the parks and create better accommodations and services.<ref name="DilsaverColten1992">{{cite book|author1=Lary M.

===Yosemite Park and Curry Company===
In 1925, the Park Service, unhappy with the declining concessions situation within the parks, decided to grant a monopoly to single entities to run the hotel and food services in each park. In response, the Curry Company and The Yosemite Park Company were merged to create one larger concessions company, with Donald Tresidder from the Curry Company as the new head. As part of this reorganization, the newly formed Yosemite Park and Curry Company proposed a new luxury hotel.<ref name="Club1998">{{cite book|author=American Alpine Club|title=The American Alpine Journal 1998|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ju90XdsRB-AC&pg=PA113|date=1 January 1998|publisher=The Mountaineers Books|isbn=978-1-933056-45-6|pages=113–}}</ref> Given the Curry Company's enormous success in the park, it was hoped that their involvement would help realize Mather's hotel.<ref name=Radanovich2004/> While the National Park Service technically had complete control over the park's operations, the Yosemite Park and Curry Company began to have further influence. The monopoly obtained leasing privileges and accumulated both financial and political benefits.<ref name="Runte1993">{{cite book|author=Alfred Runte|title=Yosemite: The Embattled Wilderness|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lC8Bdyv7JeQC&pg=PA145|date=1 January 1993|publisher=U of Nebraska Press|isbn=978-0-8032-8941-3|pages=145–}}</ref>  What began as a simple campsite run by two Indiana schoolteachers ended up as the sole concessionaire for the park,<ref>https://www.nps.gov/parkhistory/online_books/yose/camp_curry_clr.pdf</ref> and Yosemite Park and Curry Company went on to build much of the park's service structures.<ref name="Lowry2009">{{cite book|author=William R.

===Early years===
Donald Tresidder, as president of the Yosemite Park and Curry Company, built the Ahwahnee and several other major structures within the park.<ref>http://lcweb2.loc.gov/master/pnp/habshaer/ca/ca3700/ca3701/data/ca3701data.pdf</ref><ref name="Browning2005">{{cite book|author=Peter Browning|title=Yosemite Place Names: The Historic Background of Geographic Names in Yosemite National Park|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o_c0x6YRjjoC&pg=PA154|year=2005|publisher=Great West Books|isbn=978-0-944220-19-1|pages=154–}}</ref> The name originally selected for the new hotel was "Yosemite All-Year-Round Hotel", but Tresidder changed it just prior to opening to reflect the site's native name.<ref name=Scott2006 />

After the Ahwahnee was built, Tresidder had to overcome a number of financial obstacles. The cost of the hotel was nearly double the original estimate, and as fall approached, the number of guests began to dwindle.<ref>http://npshistory.com/publications/yose/hsr-degnans.pdf</ref> Park officials became concerned and suggested closing the hotel for the winter.<ref>https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CHRG-103hhrg73649/pdf/CHRG-103hhrg73649.pdf</ref> To avoid this and to keep guests and income flowing, Tresidder centered the hotel around skiing and other winter activities.<ref>http://digitalassets.lib.berkeley.edu/roho/ucb/text/lane_bill.pdf</ref><ref name="Association2003">{{cite journal|author=Gene Rose |title=The Ahwahnee: Yosemite Grandeur |journal=Skiing Heritage Journal |url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_x1gEAAAAMBAJ|date=March 2003|publisher=International Skiing History Association|pages=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_x1gEAAAAMBAJ/page/n20 21]–|issn=1082-2895}}</ref> In order to keep the hotel filled throughout the holiday period, Tresidder also proposed Christmas entertainment. A banquet event was planned based on a story by [[Washington Irving]] about an eighteenth-century English Christmas at the home of the Squire of Bracebridge. The cast was filled with locals from the park, including photographer [[Ansel Adams]].<ref name="Alinder1998">{{cite book|author=Mary Street Alinder|title=Ansel Adams: A Biography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ovu9GYmfxr8C&pg=PA128|date=15 April 1998|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=978-0-8050-5835-2|pages=128–}}</ref>

===Trademark and intellectual property disputes===
In 1993 the National Park Service required a new concessioner to purchase the Yosemite Park and Curry Company from [[MCA Inc.]] and rename the business as a new company.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iFzkO72PqJQC&q=%22Delaware+North%22+%22MCA%22+%22Yosemite+Park+and+Curry+Company%22&pg=PA73|title=Vision 2020 National Parks Restoration Act: Hearing Before the Subcommittee on National Parks, Historic Preservation, and Recreation of the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, United States Senate, One Hundred Fifth Congress, Second Session, on S. 624 ...

In 2014, Delaware North lost a bid to renew its contract with the U.S. government to Yosemite Hospitality, LLC, a division of [[Aramark]].<ref name=ars-yosemitedispute>{{cite web|title=Despite some locale renaming, "Yosemite National Park" trademark dispute persists|url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2016/01/despite-some-locale-renaming-yosemite-national-park-trademark-dispute-persists/|website=Ars Technica|access-date=17 January 2016|df=mdy-all}}</ref> When it had originally taken over the concessionaries in 1993, Delaware North was contractually required to purchase, at fair market value, "the assets of the previous concessionaire, including its intellectual property, at a cost of $115 million in today's dollars." This property included trademarks that were registered by both Delaware North and its predecessors, including place names such as Ahwahnee, [[Badger Pass Ski Area|Badger Pass]], Curry Village, [[Yosemite Lodge at the Falls|Yosemite Lodge]], the slogan "Go climb a rock", and even "Yosemite National Park" itself.<ref name=bg-tmdispute/><ref name=lat-tmdispute/> The contract with Delaware North also required that if it were to be succeeded as concessionaire, the successor must acquire all of the assets of the previous operator at fair market value. The contract with Yosemite Hospitality stated that the company be required to purchase furniture, equipment, vehicles, and "other property", but did not explicitly include [[intellectual property]].<ref name="bn-tmdispute"/>

In 2015, Delaware North sued the NPS in the [[United States Court of Claims]] for breach of contract, claiming that the contract with Yosemite Hospitality excluded intellectual property from the asset purchasing clause, and demanded a payment for the property to be determined in court. Delaware North initially asserted the fair market value of its properties to be $51 million,<ref name="bn-tmdispute">{{cite web|url=http://www.buffalonews.com/business/delaware-north-sues-park-service-over-yosemite-dispute-20150921|title=Delaware North sues park service over Yosemite dispute|work=The Buffalo News}}</ref> but the National Park Service estimated the value of the [[intangible asset]]s at $3.5 million.<ref name="bn-tmdispute"/> Delaware North claimed to have offered to temporarily license the trademarks while the dispute was unresolved and further claimed that the government did not respond to its offer.<ref name=bg-tmdispute>{{cite news|title=Iconic names at Yosemite are subject of $51 million trademark battle|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2016/01/15/boston-bruins-owner-jacobs-fight-with-national-park-service-over-yosemite-trademarks/3fTRqraPBmt3UjpG6AGkSM/story.html|access-date=17 January 2016|work=Boston Globe|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref name=lat-tmdispute>{{cite news|last1=Therolf|first1=Garrett|title=Yosemite's famous Ahwahnee Hotel to change name in trademark dispute|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-yosemite-ahwahnee-hotel-20160114-story.html|date=January 14, 2016|access-date=17 January 2016|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The dispute gained national attention after it was publicized in an issue of ''[[Outside (magazine)|Outside]]'' magazine, which led to the [[Sierra Club]] issuing a petition requesting that Delaware North drop the lawsuit.<ref name=bg-tmdispute/><ref name=lat-tmdispute/>

===Architecture and interior design===
[[File:Ahwahnee watercolor blk&wht.jpg|thumb|350px|Underwood's concept art shows a megalithic structure much grander in scale than what was finally built]]
The Ahwahnee is a {{convert|150000|sqft|adj=on}} Y-shaped building<ref name=arch/> and has 97 hotel rooms, parlors, and suites, each accented with original [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] designs. 24 cottages bring the total number of rooms to 121.<ref name=dnc>{{cite web | year = 2003 | url = http://www.yosemitepark.com/content2hdr.cfm?SectionID=23&PageID=42 | title = The Ahwahnee | work = Yosemite National Park | publisher = Delaware North Companies Parks & Resorts at Yosemite, Inc. | access-date = 7 July 2006 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060703024739/http://www.yosemitepark.com/content2hdr.cfm?SectionID=23&PageID=42 | archivedate = 2006-07-03 | url-status = dead  |df=mdy-all}}</ref>  The hotel was designed by architect [[Gilbert Stanley Underwood]], who also designed the [[Zion Lodge]], [[Bryce Canyon Lodge]], and [[Grand Canyon Lodge|Grand Canyon North Rim Lodge]]. It was made to feel rustic and match its surroundings, and the hotel is considered a masterpiece of "[[parkitecture]]".<ref name="Scott2006"/> The hotel is situated below the [[Royal Arches (Yosemite)|Royal Arches]] rock formation in a meadow area that previously served as a village for the native [[Miwok]]s and later as a stables complex known as Kenneyville. The site was chosen for its exposure to the sun, which allows for natural heating, and for its views of several Yosemite icons, including [[Glacier Point]], [[Half Dome]], and Yosemite Falls.<ref name=hist>{{cite web |year=2003 |url=http://www.yosemitepark.com/content2col.cfm?SectionID=23&PageID=336 |title=The Ahwahnee History |work=Yosemite National Park |publisher=Delaware North Companies Parks & Resorts at Yosemite, Inc. |access-date=7 July 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060315190959/http://www.yosemitepark.com/content2col.cfm?SectionID=23&PageID=336 |archivedate=2006-03-15 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all}}</ref>

[[File:Lovins' Ahwahnee interior design.jpg|thumb|200px|The original concept for the interior design by artist Henry Lovins was described as "Mayan revival" and incorporated Hispano-Moresque stylings. Lovins was replaced in 1926 by the husband and wife team of Ackerman and Pope.]]
The original concept art for the hotel depicted a building that was far grander than what would eventually be constructed.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/rusticarch/part3.htm | title=Rustic Architecture | publisher=National Park Service | work=Division of Cultural Resource Management | date=February 1977 | access-date=9 November 2013 |author1=Tweed, William |author2=Soulliere, Laura |author3= Law, Henry|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Underwood's original design called for a massive six story structure,<ref name=Scott2006 /> but Tresidder and the board requested a hotel with only 100 guest rooms that would feel more like a luxurious country home than a hotel. The design was changed several times and at one point the hotel was to be no larger than three stories high, but eventually a more expansive layout was selected to accommodate the 100 guest rooms along with several public spaces.<ref name=NPSdesign />

The interior design of the hotel also underwent several changes. Artist and interior designer Henry Lovins originally suggested a "Mayan revival" theme with Hispano-Moresque influences.<ref name=Scott2006 />  However, the husband and wife team of [[Arthur Pope|Professor Arthur Upham Pope]] and Dr. Phyllis Ackerman was selected over Lovins.<ref name=arch>{{cite web|last=Harrison |first=Laura Soullière |date=February 26, 2001 |url=http://www.cr.nps.gov/history/online_books/harrison/harrison15.htm |title=The Ahwahnee Hotel |work=Architecture in the Parks: A National Historic Landmark Theme Study |publisher=National Park Service - Department of the Interior |access-date=7 July 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060716234712/http://www.cr.nps.gov/history/online_books/harrison/harrison15.htm |archivedate=16 July 2006 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all}}</ref>  Drawing on their experience as art historians, Ackerman and Pope created a style that mixed [[Art Deco]], [[Visual arts by indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]], [[Persian art|Middle Eastern]], and [[Arts and Crafts movement|Arts and Crafts]] styles.<ref name="PioppiGonsalves2009">{{cite book|author1=Anthony Pioppi|author2=Chris Gonsalves|title=Haunted Golf: Spirited Tales from the Rough|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ku9zoUJG3NwC&pg=PA90|date=14 April 2009|publisher=Globe Pequot|isbn=978-1-59921-747-5|pages=90–|df=mdy-all}}</ref>  The interior work was carried out by a number of artisans under their supervision.

===Construction===
The hotel was constructed from {{convert|5000|shton|t|abbr=on}} of rough-cut granite, {{convert|1000|shton|t|abbr=on}} of steel, and {{convert|30000|ft|m|abbr=on}} of timber.<ref name=hist/> The steel came from the Union Iron Works in [[San Francisco]] and the timber came from land owned by the Curry family.<ref name=Radanovich2004/> The apparent wood siding and structural timber on the hotel's exterior are actually formed from stained concrete poured into molds to simulate a wood pattern.<ref name=arch/> Concrete was chosen as the material for the outside "wood" elements to make the hotel fire resistant. Construction lasted eleven months and cost US$1,225,000 upon completion in July 1927.<ref name=hist/>

After construction was complete, the company began an advertising campaign to showcase the new amenities.<ref name=Club1998 />  However, just before opening day, the director noticed that the [[porte-cochere]] planned for the west side of the building, where the Indian room now sits, would allow exhaust fumes from automobiles to invade the premises. A hastily designed [[Douglas Fir]] pole porte-cochere entry and parking area were erected on the east side of the hotel to correct this (the logs were replaced in the 1990s).  This would be the first of many changes to the hotel. In 1928, a roof garden and dance hall were converted into a private apartment after the dance hall failed to draw an audience.  In 1931, the [[Structural load#Live loads|load-bearing]] [[truss]]es in the dining room were reinforced after it was discovered that they were barely adequate to support the snow load on the roof and potential earthquake stresses.<ref name=arch/>

When [[Prohibition#Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]] was rescinded in 1933, a private dining room was converted into the El Dorado Diggins bar, evocative of the [[California Gold Rush]] period.<ref name=arch/> 1943 saw the [[United States Navy]] take over the hotel for use as a convalescent hospital for war [[veterans]].  Some of the changes made to the hotel by the Navy included a repainting of the interior, the conversion of chauffeur and maid rooms into guest rooms, and the enclosure of the original porte-cochere.<ref name=arch/>

The 1950s, '60s, and '70s brought several upgrades to the hotel, including [[fire escape]]s, a fire alarm system, smoke detectors, and a sprinkler system, along with an outdoor swimming pool and automatic elevators.<ref name=arch/>  From 2003 to 2004 the roof was overhauled, and virtually the entire slate-tile roof and copper gutter system were replaced. Martech Associates, Inc. of [[Millheim, Pennsylvania|Millheim]], Pennsylvania, designed the updated roof and served as the general contractor for the project.  The project cost approximately US$4 million and is especially notable for its 97 percent material recycling rate. An article in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' on March 13, 2009, stated that seismic retrofits may be needed for the Ahwahnee.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-ahwahnee13-2009mar13,0,5531444.story?track=rss | work=Los Angeles Times | title=Yosemite's Ahwahnee Hotel fails quake safety standards | date=13 March 2009|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

==Grand Dining Room and kitchen==
[[File:Ahwahnee Dining Room.JPG|300px|thumb|The Grand Dining Room of the Ahwahnee Hotel]]
The Grand Dining Room is 130 feet long and 51 feet wide, with a 34-foot ceiling supported with rock columns creating a cathedral-like atmosphere.<ref name=Ski>{{cite book|title=Ski|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VZ8VTfVLttIC&pg=PA181|date=November 1985|pages=181–|issn=0037-6159}}</ref>  For fire safety reasons, the wood beams in the dining room are actually hollow and contain steel beams.  The alcove window at the end of the room perfectly framed Yosemite Falls when the hotel was completed.<ref name=Radanovich2004/>  Although the dress code for the park is usually very casual, the Ahwahnee Dining Room used to require a jacket for men, but it later relaxed that tradition. Now collared shirts for men are allowed and women may wear either a dress or slacks and a blouse.<ref name=MisuracaCass2006>{{cite book|author1=Karen Misuraca|author2=Maxine Cass|title=Insiders' Guide to Yosemite|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JOndAksLV8oC&pg=PA96|date=1 May 2006|publisher=Globe Pequot Press|isbn=978-0-7627-4050-5|pages=96–}}</ref>

The Grand Dining Room was originally designed to accommodate 1,000 guests, but it was eventually scaled down to seat 350 guests.<ref name="NPSdesign">{{cite book|author1=National Park Service |title=A Sense of Place: Design Guidelines for Yosemite National Park|year=2012|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jnYtkPFPQDYC&pg=PA142|publisher=Government Printing Office|isbn=978-0-16-090412-7|pages=142–}}</ref>  However, the enormous kitchen still reflects the original design concept and includes separate stations for baking and pastries.<ref name=Ommeren2013 /> High quality kitchen appliances were installed so the hotel could compete with fine dining establishments, and the facility was specifically constructed to handle special events and functions.<ref name=Radanovich2004/>

Regular entertainment is provided at dinner by a pianist. Local Yosemite artist Dudley Kendall played piano in the dining room at the Ahwahnee for years and had his work displayed at the hotel.<ref name="Maguire2012">{{cite book|author=Hugh Maguire|title=My First 40 Jobs: A Memoir|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L7cGlvaR5B0C&pg=PA154|date=March 2012|publisher=iUniverse|isbn=978-1-4759-0137-5|pages=154–}}</ref>

===Bracebridge tradition===
The Bracebridge Dinner is a seven-course formal gathering<ref>{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/2012/oct/18/news/la-trb-bracebridge-yosemite-20121017 |title=Get ready for Bracebridge, Yosemite's famous Christmas feast| date=October 17, 2012|work=Los Angeles Times|df=mdy-all}}</ref> held in the Grand Dining Room and presented as a feast given by a [[Renaissance]]-era [[lord]]. This tradition began in 1927, the Ahwahnee's first year of operation, and was inspired by the fictional Squire Bracebridge's [[Yule]] celebration in a story from ''[[The Sketch Book of Geoffrey Crayon, Gent.]]'' by Washington Irving. Music and [[theatre|theatrical]] performances based on Irving's story accompany the introduction of each course.<ref>{{cite news| work=NBC News| url=http://www.nbcnews.com/travel/christmas-magical-national-park-lodge-1C7661428|title= Christmas is magical at a National Park lodge |access-date= 9 August 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Donald Tresidder conceived the idea for the event with his wife Mary Curry, their friends, and park staff.

Tresidder hired Garnet Holme for the event's first year to write the script and produce the event,<ref>{{cite news|work=Sierra News Online|url=http://www.sierranewsonline.com/index.php?option=com_k2&view=item&id=1353:christmas-dinner-on-a-grand-scale&Itemid=466|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130809232620/http://www.sierranewsonline.com/index.php?option=com_k2&view=item&id=1353:christmas-dinner-on-a-grand-scale&Itemid=466|url-status=dead|archive-date=9 August 2013|title=Christmas Dinner: A Grand Scale|access-date=9 August 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref> and Tresidder and his wife played the squire and his lady until Tresidder's death in 1948. Photographer Ansel Adams, who was working for the Yosemite Park and Curry Company <ref name="Spaulding1998">{{cite book|author=Jonathan Spaulding|title=Ansel Adams and the American Landscape: A Biography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gYrwnAL8nYMC&pg=PA95|year=1998|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-21663-1|pages=95–}}</ref> and was well known in Yosemite for his eccentricities, was asked to be a part of Tresidder's new winter celebrations in the elaborate, theatrical Christmas dinner with friends from the nearby [[Bohemian Club]]. Cast as the "Jester", Adams had asked the director for suggestions but was told to just act like a jester. Adams fortified himself with a few drinks and went on to climb the granite pillars to the rafters.<ref name=Spaulding1998 /> Adams played the [[Lord of Misrule]] for the first two years.  When Holme died in 1929, Tresidder asked Adams to take over the direction of the show.  Adams reworked the script considerably in 1931, creating the role of Major Domo, head of the household, for himself while his wife, Virginia Best Adams, played the housekeeper.

The dinner was not held during [[World War II]], when the Ahwahnee was functioning as a naval hospital. When it resumed, the 1946 dinner introduced chorale concerts and more significant musical performances.  Up until 1956 there was only a single performance, and then the number of performances gradually increased to a total of eight.  Ansel Adams retired from the event in 1973, passing it on to Eugene Fulton, who had been part of the male chorus since 1934 and musical director since 1946.  Fulton died unexpectedly on Christmas Eve in 1978 and his wife, Anna-Marie, and his daughter, Andrea, took over that year and produced the show.  In 1979, Andrea Fulton assumed the role of director, which she holds to this day while also playing the role of housekeeper.<ref name="Sargent1990">{{cite book|author=Shirley Sargent|title=The First 100 Years: Yosemite 1890-1990|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=opSaX6EA7hAC|year=1990|page=84|publisher=Penguin Group USA|isbn=978-0-399-51603-0}}</ref>

==Great Lounge==

The Great Lounge is one of the main public spaces in the hotel. The large space spans the full width of the wing and nearly its full length (minus the solarium).  There are two large fireplaces on either end of the room made from cut sandstone.  On either side of the lounge is a series of floor-to-ceiling plate-glass picture windows ornamented at their tops with stained glass.<ref name="Kemper2010">{{cite book|author=Lewis Kemper|title=Photographing Yosemite Digital Field Guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vGqVTwX3Bl4C&pg=PA4|date=18 March 2010|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=978-0-470-87902-3|pages=4–}}</ref>  The individual border designs in the beams of the Great Lounge are by artist Jeanette Dryer Spencer.<ref name="Ommeren2013">{{cite book|author=Alice Van Ommeren|title=Yosemite's Historic Hotels and Camps|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dYX_bGVl3zwC&pg=PA103|year=2013|publisher=Arcadia Publishing|isbn=978-0-7385-9997-7|pages=103–}}</ref>
