=== Career in lobbyism and activism ===
In 1981, Tony Podesta became a founding president of [[People for the American Way]], a [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] group started by television producer [[Norman Lear]]. He led the group until 1987.

Podesta's lobbying firm, the Podesta Group, had more than $40 million in annual revenue at its peak at the time of the Obama administration.<ref name=":0" />

In 1988 Tony and John Podesta founded Podesta Associates, which became PodestaMattoon when Republican Daniel Mattoon joined the team in 2001. The name was again changed to the [[Podesta Group]] when Mattoon left in 2006.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/11/01/AR2006110103271.html|title=PodestaMattoon By Any Other Name...|last=Sarasohn|first=Judy|date=2 November 2006|newspaper=Washington Post}}</ref>
