==History and ownership==
''Haaretz'' was first published in 1918 as a newspaper sponsored by the British military government in Palestine.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tau.ac.il/humanities/bronfman/kesher29.heb.html#haaretz |title=TAU – Institute of Jewish Press and Communications – The Andrea and Charles Bronfman Center |publisher=[[Tel Aviv University]] |accessdate=10 February 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120925002822/http://www.tau.ac.il/humanities/bronfman/kesher29.heb.html |archivedate=25 September 2012 }}</ref> In 1919, it was taken over by a group of [[Labor Zionism|socialist-oriented Zionists]], mainly from Russia.<ref name=fas>{{cite web |url=https://fas.org/irp/dni/osc/israelmedia.pdf |title=Israel — Hebrew- and English-Language Media Guide |publisher=[[Open Source Center]] |date=16 September 2008 |accessdate=13 February 2014}}</ref><ref name="A fine and fragile balance">{{cite news |last=Marmari |first=Hanoch |url=http://www.haaretz.com/a-fine-and-fragile-balance-1.119759 |title=A fine and fragile balance |work=Haaretz |date=16 April 2004 |accessdate=10 February 2013}}</ref> The newspaper was established on 18 June 1919 by a group of businessmen including the philanthropist [[Isaac Leib Goldberg]], and initially, it was called ''Hadashot Ha'aretz'' ("News of the Land"). Later, the name was shortened to ''Haaretz''.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0008_0_08065.html |title=Israel Society and Culture: Haaretz |last1=Cohen |first1=Yoel |encyclopedia=[[Jewish Virtual Library]] |accessdate=12 January 2015}}

The newspaper was initially published in [[Jerusalem]]. From 1919 to 1922, the paper was headed by a succession of editors, among them [[Leib Yaffe]]. It was closed briefly due to a budgetary shortfall and reopened in Tel Aviv at the beginning of 1923 under the editorship of Moshe Glickson, who held the post for 15 years.<ref name="A fine and fragile balance"/> The Tel Aviv municipality granted the paper financial support by paying in advance for future advertisements.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.haaretz.com/haaretz-history-1.265016 |title=Haaretz history |author=Tom Segev |author-link=Tom Segev |newspaper=Haaretz |date=18 March 2010 |accessdate=5 October 2014}}</ref>

Throughout the 1920s and 1930s, ''Haaretz'''s liberal viewpoint was to some degree associated with the [[General Zionist]] "A" faction (which would later help form the [[Progressive Party (Israel)|Progressive Party]]), though it was nonpartisan and careful not to espouse the line of any specific party.<ref>{{cite book|title=The In/Outsiders: The Media in Israel|author=Dan Caspi & Yehiel Limor|publisher=Hampton Press|year=1999|page=79|quote=Haaretz was closely aligned with the General Zionists A faction (which became the Progressive Party in 1948), a liberal stream in the Zionist Movement.

[[File:עיתונות הארץ.-JNF044326.jpeg|thumb|Haaretz Press 1934]]
[[Salman Schocken]], a Jewish businessman who left Germany in 1934 after the Nazis had come to power, bought the paper in December 1935. Schocken was active in [[Brit Shalom (political organization)|Brit Shalom]], also known as the Jewish–Palestinian Peace Alliance, a body supporting co-existence between Jews and Arabs which was sympathetic to a homeland for both peoples. His son, [[Gershom Schocken]], became the chief editor in 1939 and held that position until his death in 1990.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.haaretz.com/opinion/a-newspaper-s-mission-1.314618 |title=A newspaper's mission |author=Amos Schocken |newspaper=Haaretz |date=18 September 2002 |accessdate=5 October 2014}}</ref>

The Schocken family were the sole owners of the Haaretz Group until August 2006, when they sold a 25% stake to German publisher [[M. DuMont Schauberg]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dumont.eu/dumont/dir/?101798 |title=M. DuMont Schauberg.

On 12 June 2011, it was announced that Russian-Israeli businessman [[Leonid Nevzlin]] had purchased a 20% stake in the Haaretz Group, buying 15% from the family and 5% from M.&nbsp;DuMont Schauberg.<ref>{{cite news |author=Li-or Averbach |url=http://www.globes.co.il/en/article-1000653184 |title=Russian immigrant billionaire buys 20% of "Haaretz" |newspaper=[[Globes (newspaper)|Globes]] |date=12 June 2011 |accessdate=5 October 2014}}</ref>

In October 2012, a union strike mobilized to protest planned layoffs by the ''Haaretz'' management, causing a one-day interruption of ''Haaretz'' and its ''TheMarker'' business supplement. According to [[Israel Radio]], it was the first time since 1965 that a newspaper did not go to press on account of a strike.<ref>{{cite news|last=Koopmans |first=Ofira |title=Journalists at Israel's Haaretz newspaper strike over job cuts |url=http://en.europeonline-magazine.eu/journalists-at-israels-haaretz-newspaper-strike-over-job-cuts_241385.html |publisher=Europe Online |date=4 October 2012 |accessdate=12 October 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130527082723/http://en.europeonline-magazine.eu/journalists-at-israels-haaretz-newspaper-strike-over-job-cuts_241385.html |archivedate=27 May 2013 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title='Haaretz' daily not printed today |url=http://www.globes.co.il/en/article-1000787939 |newspaper=[[Globes (newspaper)|Globes]] |date=4 October 2012 |accessdate=5 October 2014}}</ref>

==Management==
The newspaper's editorial policy was defined by [[Gershom Schocken]], who was editor-in-chief from 1939 to 1990. Schocken was succeeded as editor-in-chief by Hanoch Marmari. In 2004 [[David Landau (journalist)|David Landau]] replaced Marmari and was succeeded by [[Dov Alfon]] in 2008.<ref name=remnick/> The current editor-in-chief of the newspaper is [[Aluf Benn]], who replaced Alfon in August 2011.<ref name="benn-named" /> Charlotte Halle became editor of the English print edition in February 2008.

==Editorial policy and viewpoints==
''Haaretz'' describes itself as having "a broadly liberal outlook both on domestic issues and on international affairs".<ref>{{cite news |work=Haaretz |url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/about-haaretz-1.63277 |title=About Haaretz |accessdate=5 October 2014}}</ref> Others describe it alternatively as liberal,<ref>

[[Andrea Levin]], executive director of the American pro-Israel [[Committee for Accuracy in Middle East Reporting]] (CAMERA), said the newspaper was doing "damage to the truth" and sometimes making serious factual errors but not often correcting them.<ref>{{cite news|last=Ross |first=Oakland |title=News and views that inspire love or kindle hatred |url=https://www.thestar.com/news/2008/10/05/news_and_views_that_inspire_love_or_kindle_hatred.html |newspaper=[[Toronto Star]] |date=5 October 2008 |accessdate=13 February 2014 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130204064540/http://www.thestar.com/article/512004--news-and-views-that-inspire-love-or-kindle-hatred |archivedate=4 February 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref>
