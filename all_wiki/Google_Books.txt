The Publisher Program was first known as Google Print when it was introduced at the [[Frankfurt Book Fair]] in October 2004. The Google Books Library Project, which scans works in the collections of library partners and adds them to the digital inventory, was announced in December 2004.

The Google Books initiative has been hailed for its potential to offer unprecedented access to what may become the largest online body of human knowledge<ref>{{cite news|first=Kevin|last=Bergquist|title=Google project promotes public good|url=http://www.umich.edu/~urecord/0506/Feb13_06/02.shtml|work=The University Record|publisher=[[University of Michigan]]|date=2006-02-13|access-date=2007-04-11 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Is This the Renaissance or the Dark Ages?|last=Pace|first=Andrew K.|url=http://www.ala.org/ala/alonline/techspeaking/2006columnsa/techJan2006.cfm|date=January 2006|website=American Libraries|publisher=[[American Library Association]]|access-date=2007-04-11|quote=Google made instant e-book believers out of skeptics even though 10 years of e-book evangelism among librarians had barely made progress. |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070403083647/http://www.ala.org/ala/alonline/techspeaking/2006columnsa/techJan2006.cfm |archive-date=2007-04-03 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and promoting the [[democratization of knowledge]].<ref name="spiegel">[http://www.spiegel.de/international/business/0,1518,473529-2,00.html Malte Herwig, "Google's Total Library", ''Spiegel Online International'', Mar. 28, 2007.]</ref>

==Details==

Results from Google Books show up in both the universal [[Google Search]] and in the dedicated Google Books search website (''books.google.com'').

In response to search queries, Google Books allows users to view full pages from books in which the search terms appear if the book is out of copyright or if the copyright owner has given permission. If Google believes the book is still under copyright, a user sees "snippets" of text around the queried search terms. All instances of the search terms in the book text appear with a yellow highlight.

The four access levels used on Google Books are:<ref name="Google">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/googlebooks/library/index.html|title=Google Books Library Project – An enhanced card catalog of the world's books|access-date=26 January 2015}}</ref>
* '''Full view''': Books in the [[public domain]] are available for "full view" and can be downloaded for free. In-print books acquired through the Partner Program are also available for full view if the publisher has given permission, although this is rare.
* '''Preview''': For in-print books where permission has been granted, the number of viewable pages is limited to a "preview" set by a variety of access restrictions and security measures, some based on user-tracking. Usually, the publisher can set the percentage of the book available for preview.<ref>{{cite web |first=Greg |last=Duffy|title= Google's Cookie and Hacking Google Print|date=March 2005|url=http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2005/3/7/95844/59875 |website=[[Kuro5hin]]}}</ref> Users are restricted from copying, downloading or printing book previews. A watermark reading "Copyrighted material" appears at the bottom of pages. All books acquired through the Partner Program are available for preview.
* '''Snippet view''': A "snippet view" – two to three lines of text surrounding the queried search term – is displayed in cases where Google does not have permission of the copyright owner to display a preview. This could be because Google cannot identify the owner or the owner declined permission. If a search term appears many times in a book, Google displays no more than three snippets, thus preventing the user from viewing too much of the book. Also, Google does not display any snippets for certain reference books, such as dictionaries, where the display of even snippets can harm the market for the work. Google maintains that no permission is required under copyright law to display the snippet view.<ref name=Jonathan/>
* '''No preview''': Google also displays search results for books that have not been digitized. As these books have not been scanned, their text is not searchable and only the [[metadata]] such as the title, author, publisher, number of pages, ISBN, subject and copyright information, and in some cases, a table of contents and book summary is available. In effect, this is similar to an online library card catalog.<ref name="book sources"/>

In response to criticism from groups such as the [[American Association of Publishers]] and the [[Authors Guild]], Google announced an [[opt-out]] policy in August 2005, through which copyright owners could provide a list of titles that they do not want scanned, and the request would be respected. The company also stated that it would not scan any in-copyright books between August and 1 November 2005, to provide the owners with the opportunity to decide which books to exclude from the Project. Thus, copyright owners have three choices with respect to any work:<ref name=Jonathan>{{cite web|url=http://quod.lib.umich.edu/p/plag/5240451.0001.002/--google-library-project-both-sides-of-the-story?rgn=main;view=fulltext|title=The Google Library Project: Both Sides of the Story|first=Jonathan|last=Band|date=2006|publisher=University of Michigan}}</ref>
# It can participate in the Partner Program to make a book available for preview or full view, in which case it would share revenue derived from the display of pages from the work in response to user queries.
# It can let Google scan the book under the Library Project and display snippets in response to user queries.
# It can opt out of the Library Project, in which case Google will not scan the book. If the book has already been scanned, Google will reset its access level as 'No preview'.

Most scanned works are no longer in print or commercially available.<ref name=pcworldscan>{{cite news|first=Juan Carlos|last=Perez|title=In Google Book Settlement, Business Trumps Ideals|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/153085/article.html|quote=Of the seven&nbsp;million books Google has scanned, one&nbsp;million are in full preview mode as part of formal publisher agreements. Another one&nbsp;million are public domain works.|work=[[PC World (magazine)|PC World]]|date=October 28, 2008|access-date=2013-08-27 }}</ref>

In addition to procuring books from libraries, Google also obtains books from its publisher partners, through the "Partner Program" – designed to help publishers and authors promote their books. Publishers and authors submit either a digital copy of their book in [[EPUB]] or [[Portable Document Format|PDF]] format, or a print copy to Google, which is made available on Google Books for preview. The publisher can control the percentage of the book available for preview, with the minimum being 20%. They can also choose to make the book fully viewable, and even allow users to download a PDF copy. Books can also be made available for sale on Google Play.<ref name="book sources">{{Cite web|url=https://support.google.com/books/answer/43726?hl=en-IN&ref_topic=4359341|title=Where do these books come from?|website=Google Books Help|access-date=10 November 2014}}</ref> Unlike the Library Project, this does not raise any copyright concerns as it is conducted pursuant to an agreement with the publisher. The publisher can choose to withdraw from the agreement at any time.<ref name=Jonathan/>

For many books, Google Books displays the original page numbers. However, [[Tim Parks]], writing in ''The New York Review of Books'' in 2014, noted that Google had stopped providing page numbers for many recent publications (likely the ones acquired through the Partner Program) "presumably in alliance with the publishers, in order to force those of us who need to prepare footnotes to buy paper editions."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nybooks.com/blogs/nyrblog/2014/sep/13/references-please/|title=References, Please|first=Tim |last=Parks|work=[[The New York Review of Books]]|date=13 September 2014}}</ref>

==Scanning of books==
The project began in 2002 under the codename Project Ocean. Google co-founder [[Larry Page]] had always had an interest in digitizing books. When he and [[Marissa Mayer]] began experimenting with [[book scanning]] in 2002, it took 40 minutes for them to digitize a 300-page book. But soon after the technology had been developed to the extent that scanning operators could scan up to 6000 pages an hour.<ref name=atlantic/>

Google established designated scanning centers to which books were transported by trucks. The stations could digitize at the rate of 1,000 pages per hour. The books were placed in a custom-built mechanical cradle that adjusted the book spine in place for the scanning. An array of lights and optical instruments was used – including four cameras, two directed at each half of the book, and a range finder [[LIDAR]] that overlaid a three-dimensional laser grid on the book's surface to capture the curvature of the paper. A human operator would turn the pages by hand and operate the cameras through a foot pedal. The system was made efficient since there was no need to flatten the book pages or align them perfectly. The crude images were worked upon by de-warping algorithms that used the LIDAR data to process them. [[Optical character recognition]] (OCR) software was developed to process the raw images to text. Algorithms were also created to extract page numbers, footnotes, illustrations and diagrams.<ref name=atlantic>{{cite web|author=James Somers|title=Torching the Modern-Day Library of Alexandria|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/04/the-tragedy-of-google-books/523320/|publisher=The Atlantic|date=20 April 2017}}</ref>

Many of the books are scanned using a customized [[Elphel]] 323 camera<ref>{{cite web|last=Almaer|first=Dion|title=Weekly Google Code Roundup for August 10th|url=http://googlecode.blogspot.co.uk/2007/08/weekly-google-code-roundup-for-august.html|website=Google Code|access-date=27 August 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Resume of Ted Merrill, Software Engineer |url=http://www.embuildsw.com/TedMerrill_Resume.html |quote="Adapted firmware of Elphel 323 camera to meet needs of Google Book Search" |access-date=27 August 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/5ZiPASUCN?url=http://www.embuildsw.com/TedMerrill_Resume.html |archive-date=31 July 2008 }}</ref> at a rate of 1,000 pages per hour.<ref name="nyt">{{cite news|first=Kevin|last=Kelly|title=Scan This Book!|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/14/magazine/14publishing.html|quote=When Google announced in December 2004 that it would digitally scan the books of five major research libraries to make their contents searchable, the promise of a universal library was resurrected. ...

By constructing a 3D model of each page and then "de-warping" it, Google is able to present flat-looking pages without having to really make the pages flat, which requires the use of destructive methods such as [[Book scanning#Unbinding|unbinding]] or glass plates to individually flatten each page, which is inefficient for large scale scanning.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cnet.com/news/patent-reveals-googles-book-scanning-advantage/ |title=Patent reveals Google's book-scanning advantage |first=Stephen |last = Shankland |date=4 May 2009|website=CNET }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/library/2009/04/the_granting_of_patent_7508978.html |title=The Secret Of Google's Book Scanning Machine Revealed |first = Maureen |last = Clements|date=30 April 2009|website=NPR.org}}</ref>

==Website functionality==
Each book on Google Books has an overview page which displays analytical information such as a word map of the most used words and phrases, list of scholarly articles and other books that cite the book, tables of content, etc. This is collated through automated methods, though sometimes data from third-party sources is used.<ref>{{cite web |url = https://support.google.com/books/answer/53549 |title=Where do you get the information for the 'About this book' page? |website=Google Books Help |access-date=14 November 2014}}</ref><ref name=Salon>{{cite web |url = http://www.salon.com/2010/12/08/google_ebookstore/ |title=Is Google leading an e-book revolution? |date=8 December 2010|website=Salon|first=Laura |last = Miller|quote=Google has incorporated reader reviews from the social networking service GoodReads, which helps, as these are often more thoughtful than the average Amazon reader review, but the "related books" suggestion lists still have some kinks to iron out — fans of Rebecca Skloot's "The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks" are referred to a trashy novel titled "Bling Addiction," for example}}</ref> A book summary may also be displayed in some cases. Bibliographic information is also shown which can be exported as [[citation]]s in [[Citation#Styles|standard formats]]. Registered users logged in with their [[Google account]]s can post reviews for books. Google Books also displays reviews from [[Goodreads]] alongside these reviews.<ref name=Salon/>

The service allows linking to books using the [[International Standard Book Number|ISBN]], [[Library of Congress Control Number|LCCN]] or [[Online Computer Library Center|OCLC]] record numbers. The overview page of a book with the {{Text|ISBN}} 123456789X can be linked as {{mono|1=https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN123456789X}}. For some books, it is also possible to link directly to the front cover, title page, copyright page, table of contents, index, and back cover, by using an appropriate parameter. For example, the front cover of a book with the OCLC number 17546826 can be linked as {{mono|1=https://books.google.com/books?vid=OCLC17546826&printsec=frontcover}}.<ref name=books-help/>

Users signed with a [[Google account]] can create a personalized "library" of books, organized using "bookshelves", which can also be made publicly viewable.<ref>{{Cite web|url= https://support.google.com/books/answer/75375?topic=9259|title=My Library FAQ|website=Google Books Help|access-date=6 November 2014}}</ref>

== Ngram Viewer ==
{{main|Google Ngram Viewer}}

The Ngram Viewer is a service connected to Google Books that graphs the frequency of word usage across their book collection. The service is important for historians and linguists as it can provide an inside look into human culture through word use throughout time periods.<ref name="Zimmer">{{Cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/10/bigger-better-google-ngrams-brace-yourself-for-the-power-of-grammar/263487/|title=Bigger, Better Google Ngrams: Brace Yourself for the Power of Grammar|last=Zimmer|first=Ben|language=en-US|access-date=2016-09-20}}</ref> This program has fallen under criticism because of errors in the metadata used in the program.<ref name=":1" />

==Content issues and criticism==
The project has received criticism that its stated aim of preserving orphaned and out-of-print works is at risk due to scanned data having errors and such problems not being solved.<ref>{{cite web |url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/02/06/AR2009020601069.html |title = paidContent.org - The Plot Thickens For E-Books: Google And Amazon Putting More Titles On Mobile Phones |first = Dianne See |last = Morrison |date=6 February 2009|work=The Washington Post}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url = https://musictechpolicy.wordpress.com/2009/09/29/google-books-how-bad-is-the-metadata-let-me-count-the-ways/ |title=Google Books: How bad is the metadata?

===Scanning errors===
[[File:Hand of Google.png|thumb|right|A hand scanned in a Google book]]
The scanning process is subject to errors. For example, some pages may be unreadable, upside down, or in the wrong order. Scholars have even reported crumpled pages, obscuring thumbs and fingers, and smeared or blurry images.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/2010/12/08/google_ebookstore/ |title=Is Google leading an e-book revolution?|date=8 December 2010|website=Salon|first=Laura |last = Miller }}</ref> On this issue, a declaration from Google at the end of scanned books says:
{{Cquote|The digitization at the most basic level is based on page images of the physical books. To make this book available as an ePub formatted file we have taken those page images and extracted the text using Optical Character Recognition (or OCR for short) technology. The extraction of text from page images is a difficult engineering task. Smudges on the physical books' pages, fancy fonts, old fonts, torn pages, etc. can all lead to errors in the extracted text. Imperfect OCR is only the first challenge in the ultimate goal of moving from collections of page images to extracted-text based books. Our computer algorithms also have to automatically determine the structure of the book (what are the headers and footers, where images are placed, whether text is verse or prose, and so forth).

Getting this right allows us to render the book in a way that follows the format of the original book. Despite our best efforts you may see spelling mistakes, garbage characters, extraneous images, or missing pages in this book. Based on our estimates, these errors should not prevent you from enjoying the content of the book. The technical challenges of automatically constructing a perfect book are daunting, but we continue to make enhancements to our OCR and book structure extraction technologies.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fhUXAAAAYAAJ&pg=GBS.PA527|title=''Great Expections'' by Charles Dickens on Google Books reader|year=1881|last1=Dickens|first1=Charles}}</ref>}}
As of 2009 Google stated that they would start using [[ReCAPTCHA]] to help fix the errors found in Google Book scannings. This method would only improve scanned words that are hard to recognize because of the scanning process and cannot solve errors such as turned pages or blocked words.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/google-acquisition-will-help-correct-errors-in-scanned-works/|title=Google Acquisition Will Help Correct Errors in Scanned Works|access-date=2016-09-20}}</ref>

===Errors in metadata===
Scholars have frequently reported rampant errors in the [[metadata]] information on Google Books – including misattributed authors and erroneous dates of publication. [[Geoffrey Nunberg]], a linguist researching on the changes in word usage over time noticed that a search for books published before 1950 and containing the word "internet" turned up an unlikely 527 results. Woody Allen is mentioned in 325 books ostensibly published before he was born. Google responded to Nunberg by blaming the bulk of errors on the outside contractors.<ref name=":1">{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/2010/09/09/google_books/|title=The trouble with Google Books|website=Salon|first=Laura |last = Miller |date=9 September 2010}}</ref>

Other metadata errors reported include publication dates before the author's birth (e.g. 182 works by Charles Dickens prior to his birth in 1812); incorrect subject classifications (an edition of ''Moby Dick'' found under "computers", a biography of Mae West classified under "religion"), conflicting classifications (10 editions of Whitman's ''Leaves of Grass'' all classified as both "fiction" and "nonfiction"), incorrectly spelled titles, authors, and publishers (''Moby Dick: or the White "Wall"''), and metadata for one book incorrectly appended to a completely different book (the metadata for an 1818 mathematical work leads to a 1963 romance novel).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/major-errors-prompt-questions-over-google-book-searchs-scholarly-value/408085.article|title=Major errors prompt questions over Google Book Search's scholarly value|date=10 September 2009 }}</ref><ref>[http://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~nunberg/GBook/GoogBookMetadataSh.pdf "Google Books: The Metadata Mess"], Geoffrey Nunberg</ref>

{{quote|A review of the author, title, publisher, and publication year metadata elements for 400 randomly selected Google Books records was undertaken. The results show 36% of sampled books in the digitization project contained metadata errors. This error rate is higher than one would expect to find in a typical library online catalog.<ref>[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/241746166_An_Assessment_of_Google_Books'_Metadata James and Weiss (2012): "An Assessment of Google Books' Metadata", abstract, p. 1]|Ryan James and Andrew Weiss</ref>}}

{{quote|The overall error rate of 36.75% found in this study suggests that Google Books' metadata has a high rate of error. While "major" and "minor" errors are a subjective distinction based on the somewhat indeterminate concept of "findability", the errors found in the four metadata elements examined in this study should all be considered major.<ref>[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/241746166_An_Assessment_of_Google_Books'_Metadata James and Weiss (2012): "An Assessment of Google Books' Metadata", p. 5|Ryan James and Andrew Weiss]</ref>}}

Metadata errors based on incorrect scanned dates makes research using the Google Books Project database difficult. Google has shown only limited interest in cleaning up these errors.<ref>{{cite news |last=Nunberg |first=Geoffrey |date=August 31, 2009 |title=Google's Book Search: A Disaster for Scholars |url=http://chronicle.com/article/Googles-Book-Search-A/48245/ |work=[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]] |access-date=25 December 2019}}</ref>

===Language issues===
Some European politicians and intellectuals have criticized Google's effort on [[linguistic imperialism]] grounds. They argue that because the vast majority of books proposed to be scanned are in English, it will result in disproportionate representation of natural languages in the digital world. German, Russian, French, and Spanish, for instance, are popular languages in scholarship. The disproportionate online emphasis on English, however, could shape access to historical scholarship, and, ultimately, the growth and direction of future scholarship. Among these critics is [[Jean-Noël Jeanneney]], the former president of the ''[[Bibliothèque nationale de France]]''.<ref>{{cite book | isbn=978-0-226-39577-7 |author=Jean-Noël Jeanneney |title=Google and the Myth of Universal Knowledge: A View from Europe |format=book abstract; Foreword by Ian Wilson |date=2006-10-23 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rc19MRhlUEgC |pages=vii–xiii|author-link=Jean-Noël Jeanneney }}</ref>

===Google Books versus Google Scholar===
While Google Books has digitized large numbers of journal back issues, its scans do not include the metadata required for identifying specific articles in specific issues. This has led the makers of [[Google Scholar]] to start their own program to digitize and host older journal articles (in agreement with their publishers).<ref>Barbara Quint, [http://newsbreaks.infotoday.com/nbReader.asp?ArticleId=37309 "Changes at Google Scholar: A Conversation With Anurag Acharya"], ''Information Today'', August 27, 2007.</ref>

==Library partners==

The Google Books Library Project is aimed at scanning and making searchable the collections of several major research [[libraries]].<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Stein|first1=Linda L.|last2=Lehu|first2=Peter, J|year=2009|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PydRWpl4OTYC&pg=PA261|title=Literary Research and the American Realism and Naturalism Period: Strategies and Sources|page=261|isbn=9780810861411}}</ref> Along with [[bibliographic]] information, snippets of text from a book are often viewable. If a book is out of [[copyright]] and in the public domain, the book is fully available to read or [[download]].<ref name="Google"/>

In-copyright books scanned through the Library Project are made available on Google Books for snippet view. Regarding the quality of scans, Google acknowledges that they are "not always of sufficiently high quality" to be offered for sale on Google Play. Also, because of supposed technical constraints, Google does not replace scans with higher quality versions that may be provided by the publishers.<ref name=books-help>{{cite web|url=https://support.google.com/books/partner/faq/3396243?rd=1|title=Books Help|access-date=26 January 2015}}</ref>

The project is the subject of the ''[[Authors Guild v. Google]]'' lawsuit, filed in 2005 and ruled in favor of Google in 2013, and again, on appeal, in 2015.

Copyright owners can claim the rights for a scanned book and make it available for preview or full view (by "transferring" it to their Partner Program account), or request Google to prevent the book text from being searched.<ref name="books-help" />

The number of institutions participating in the Library Project has grown since its inception.<ref name="gblp1" />

==History==
'''2002''': A group of team members at Google officially launch the "secret 'books' project."<ref name="books.google.com">{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/googlebooks/about/history.html |title=Google Books History – Google Books |url-status=unfit |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160206043510/http://books.google.com/googlebooks/about/history.html |archive-date=2016-02-06 |access-date=2016-02-22}}</ref> Google founders [[Sergey Brin]] and [[Larry Page]] came up with the idea that later became Google Books while still graduate students at Stanford in 1996. The history page on the Google Books website describes their initial vision for this project: "in a future world in which vast collections of books are digitized, people would use a '[[web crawler]]' to index the books' content and analyze the connections between them, determining any given book's relevance and usefulness by tracking the number and quality of citations from other books."<ref name="books.google.com" /> This team visited the sites of some of the larger digitization efforts at that time including the Library of Congress's [[American Memory|American Memory Project]], [[Project Gutenberg]], and the Universal Library to find out how they work, as well as the University of Michigan, Page's alma mater, and the base for such digitization projects as [[JSTOR]] and Making of America. In a conversation with the at that time University President [[Mary Sue Coleman]], when Page found out that the University's current estimate for scanning all the library's volumes was 1,000 years, Page reportedly told Coleman that he "believes Google can help make it happen in six."<ref name="books.google.com" />

'''2003''': The team works to develop a high-speed scanning process as well as software for resolving issues in odd type sizes, unusual fonts, and "other unexpected peculiarities."<ref name="books.google.com" />

'''December 2004''': Google signaled an extension to its Google Print initiative known as the Google Print Library Project.<ref name="gblp1">O'Sullivan, Joseph and Adam Smith.
[http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2004/12/all-booked-up.html "All booked up,"] ''Googleblog.'' December 14, 2004.</ref> Google announced partnerships with several high-profile university and public libraries, including the [[University of Michigan]], [[Harvard University|Harvard]] ([[Harvard University Library]]), [[Stanford]] ([[Green Library]]), [[Oxford University|Oxford]] ([[Bodleian Library]]), and the [[New York Public Library]]. According to press releases and university librarians, Google planned to digitize and make available through its Google Books service approximately 15&nbsp;million volumes within a decade. The announcement soon triggered controversy, as publisher and author associations challenged Google's plans to digitize, not just books in the public domain, but also titles still under copyright.

'''September–October 2005''': Two lawsuits against Google charge that the company has not respected [[copyright]]s and has failed to properly compensate authors and publishers. One is a class action suit on behalf of authors (Authors Guild v. Google, Sept. 20 2005) and the other is a civil lawsuit brought by five large publishers and the [[Association of American Publishers]]. ([[McGraw Hill v. Google]], Oct. 19 2005)<ref name=LAWSUITS>

===Status===
Google has been quite secretive regarding its plans on the future of the Google Books project. Scanning operations had been slowing down since at least 2012, as confirmed by the librarians at several of Google's partner institutions. At University of Wisconsin, the speed had reduced to less than half of what it was in 2006. However, the librarians have said that the dwindling pace could be a natural result of maturation of the project – initially stacks of books were entirely taken up for scanning whereas now only the titles that had not already been scanned needed to be considered.<ref name=chronicle>{{cite web|author=Jennifer Howard|title=Google Begins to Scale Back Its Scanning of Books From University Libraries|url=https://www.chronicle.com/article/Google-Begins-to-Scale-Back/131109|publisher=The Chronicle of Higher Education|date=9 March 2012}}</ref> The company's own Google Books timeline page did not mention anything after 2007 even in 2017, and the Google Books blog was merged into the Google Search blog in 2012.<ref name=wired/>

Despite winning the decade-long litigation in 2017, ''[[The Atlantic]]'' has said that Google has "all but shut down its scanning operation."<ref name=atlantic/> In April 2017, ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' reported that there were only a few Google employees working on the project, and new books were still being scanned, but at a significantly lower rate. It commented that the decade-long legal battle had caused Google to lose its ambition.<ref name=wired>{{cite web|author=Scott Rosenberg|title=How Google Book Search Got Lost|url=https://www.wired.com/2017/04/how-google-book-search-got-lost/|website=Wired|date=11 April 2017}}</ref>

== Legal issues ==
{{further|Authors Guild v. Google}}

Through the project, library books were being digitized somewhat indiscriminately regardless of copyright status, which led to a number of lawsuits against Google. By the end of 2008, Google had reportedly digitized over seven million books, of which only about one million were works in the public domain. Of the rest, one million were in copyright and in print, and five million were in copyright but out of print. In 2005, a group of authors and publishers brought a major class-action lawsuit against Google for infringement on the copyrighted works. Google argued that it was preserving "orphaned works" – books still under copyright, but whose copyright holders could not be located.<ref>{{cite web|author=Robert Darnton|title=Google and the Future of Books|website=The New York Review of Books|date=February 12, 2009|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2009/feb/12/google-the-future-of-books/}}</ref>

<!-- THE FOLLOWING NEEDS TO MERGED IN WITH THE TEXT BELOW: The suit was ultimately settled out of court in 2009, but the settlement itself has been controversial, as it potentially sets Google up as the world's largest information broker, and virtually frees it from any copyright liability.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2010/01/the-sequel-stinks-critics-trash-new-google-books-settlement/|title=The sequel stinks: critics trash new Google Books settlement|website=Ars Technica|date=30 January 2010|author=John Timmer}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/04/technology/internet/04books.html|title=Google's Plan for Out-of-Print Books Is Challenged|author=Miguel Helft|date=3 April 2009|publisher=The New York Times}}</ref> There are also questions as to how the settlement, arrived at in US courts, would impact authors and publishers in other countries. In 2011, the judge overseeing the settlement put it on hold,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2009/sep/25/google-books-delayed|title=Google Books deal postponed after avalanche of criticism|author=Bobbie Johnson|date=25 September 2009|publisher=The Guardian}}</ref> and as of April 2014 the settlement decision is being appealed by the original plaintiffs in the class-action. END -->The [[Authors Guild]] and [[Association of American Publishers]] separately sued Google in 2005 for its book project, citing "massive [[copyright infringement]]."<ref>{{cite web|title=Authors sue Google over book plan|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/4266586.stm|website=BBC NEWS|access-date=23 April 2018}}</ref> Google countered that its project represented a [[fair use]] and is the digital age equivalent of a [[card catalog]] with every word in the publication indexed.<ref name=LAWSUITS/> The lawsuits were consolidated, and eventually a [[Google Book Search Settlement Agreement|settlement was proposed]]. The settlement received significant criticism on a wide variety of grounds, including antitrust, privacy, and inadequacy of the proposed classes of authors and publishers. The settlement was eventually rejected,<ref>770 F.Supp.2d 666 (SDNY March 22, 2011).</ref> and the publishers settled with Google soon after. The Authors Guild continued its case, and in 2011 their proposed [[class certification|class was certified]]. Google appealed that decision, with a number of [[amicus curiae|amici]] asserting the [[inadequacy of the class]], and the Second Circuit rejected the [[class certification]] in July 2013, remanding the case to the District Court for consideration of Google's [[fair use]] defense.<ref>''[[Authors Guild v. Google]]'', 2d Cir. July 1, 2013.</ref>

In 2015 Authors Guild filed another appeal against Google to be considered by the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York. Google won the case unanimously based on the argument that they were not showing people the full texts but instead snippets, and they are not allowing people to illegally read the book.<ref name=":0">{{cite web|last=Peet|first=Lisa|date=2015-10-19|title=U.S. Appeals Court Rules Google Book Scanning Is Fair Use|url=http://lj.libraryjournal.com/2015/10/copyright/u-s-appeals-court-rules-google-book-scanning-is-fair-use/|url-status=usurped|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180125174514/http://lj.libraryjournal.com/2015/10/copyright/u-s-appeals-court-rules-google-book-scanning-is-fair-use/|archive-date=2018-01-25|access-date=2016-09-20|website=Library Journal}}</ref> In a report, courts stated that they did not infringe on copyright laws, as they were protected under the fair use clause.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/ca2/13-4829/13-4829-2015-10-16.html |title = Authors Guild v. Google, Inc., No. 13-4829 (2d Cir. 2015) |access-date=2016-09-21}}</ref>

Authors Guild tried again in 2016 to appeal the decision and this time took their case to be considered by the Supreme Court. The case was rejected, leaving the Second Circuit's decision on the case intact, meaning that Google did not violate copyright laws.<ref>{{cite web |url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2016/04/18/google-books-just-won-a-decade-long-copyright-fight/ |title=Google Books just won a decade-long copyright fight |website=Washington Post|access-date=2016-09-20}}</ref> This case also set a precedent for other case similar in regards to fair use laws as it further clarified the law and expands it. Such clarification is important in the new digital age as it affects other scanning projects similar to Google.<ref name=":0" />

Other lawsuits followed the Authors Guild's lead. In 2006 a German lawsuit, previously filed, was withdrawn.<ref>

Google licensing of public domain works is also an area of concern due to using of [[digital watermarking]] techniques with the books. Some published works that are in the public domain, such as all [[Copyright status of work by the U.S. government|works created by the U.S. Federal government]], are still treated like other works under copyright, and therefore locked after 1922.<ref>Robert B.
