'''PFLAG''' is the United States' first and largest organization uniting parents, families, and allies with people who are [[lesbian]], [[gay]], [[Bisexuality|bisexual]], [[transgender]], and [[queer]] ([[LGBTQ+]]). PFLAG National is the national organization, which provides support to the PFLAG network of local chapters.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pflag.org/find-a-chapter|title=Find a Chapter {{!}} PFLAG|website=www.pflag.org|access-date=2017-08-10}}</ref> PFLAG has over 400 chapters across the United States, with more than 200,000 members and supporters.

''PFLAG'' (pronounced {{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|iː|f|l|æ|ɡ}} {{respell|PEE|flag}}) is no longer an acronym, but just the name of the organization. Prior to 2014, the acronym stood for '''Parents and Friends of Lesbians and Gays''' (later broadened to '''Parents, Families and Friends of Lesbians and Gays'''). Until removal of the hyphen in 1993 the name was officially styled as P-FLAG.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://community.pflag.org/Page.aspx?pid=279 |title=See banner styled P-FLAG |publisher=PFLAG |accessdate=2010-06-30 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20120707043325/http://community.pflag.org/Page.aspx?pid=279 |archivedate=2012-07-07 }}</ref> In 2014 the membership of the organization voted to officially change the name to PFLAG to reflect the decades of fully inclusive work it had been doing in the LGBTQ+ community.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pflag.org/blog/newpresidentnewinclusivename|title=PFLAG NATIONAL ANNOUNCES NEW PRESIDENT, NEW INCLUSIVE NAME|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=PFLAG|accessdate=2017-08-10}}</ref>

==History==
[[File:Jeanne Manford marching with her famous sign in a Pride Parade in 1972.jpg|Jeanne Manford marching with her now-famous sign. Reactions to this sign led Manford to create a support group, which evolved into PFLAG.|thumb|right|250px]]
In April 1972, [[Jeanne Manford]], an elementary school teacher, and her husband were at home in [[Flushing, Queens]], when they learned from a hospital's telephone call that her son Morty, a gay activist, had been beaten while distributing flyers inside the fiftieth annual [[Inner Circle (parody group)|Inner Circle]] dinner, a political gathering in New York City.<ref name=mortyobit>{{cite news|last=Lambert|first=Bruce|title=Morty Manford, 41, a Lawyer And Early Gay-Rights Advocate|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/05/15/nyregion/morty-manford-41-a-lawyer-and-early-gay-rights-advocate.html|accessdate=10 September 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=15 May 1992}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Lii|first=Jane H.|title=Unlikely Supporter of Gay Rights Recalls Pivotal Night|newspaper=The New York Times|date=3 November 1996}}</ref> In response, she wrote a letter of protest to the ''[[New York Post]]'' that identified herself as the mother of a gay protester and complained of police inaction.{{sfn|Marcus|2002|pp=170–171}} She gave interviews to radio and television shows in several cities in the weeks that followed, sometimes accompanied by her husband or son.{{sfn|Marcus|2002|p=172}} On June 25, she participated with her son in the New York [[LGBT Pride March (New York City)|Pride March]], carrying a hand-lettered sign that read "Parents of Gays Unite in Support for Our Children".{{sfn|Marcus|2002|p=173}} Prompted by their enthusiastic reception, they developed an idea for an organization of the parents of gays and lesbians that could be, she later said, "a bridge between the gay community and the heterosexual community".{{sfn|Marcus|2002|p=175}} They were soon holding meetings for such parents, with her husband participating as well. She called him "a very articulate person&nbsp;... a much better speaker than I. He was right along with me on everything."{{sfn|Marcus|2002|pp=174–175}}

The first formal meeting took place on March 11, 1973 at the Metropolitan-Duane Methodist Church in Greenwich Village (now the Church of the Village). Approximately 20 people attended. In the next few years, through word of mouth and community need, similar groups sprang up around the country, offering "safe havens" and mutual support for parents with gay and lesbian children. In 1976, PFLAG LA had their first meeting of 30 parents. By 1977, the group had integrated with other LGBT activist groups to oppose Anita Bryant's anti-gay crusade and defeat the statewide [[Briggs Initiative]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pflag.org/blog/pflag-founder-remembered-adele-starr|title=PFLAG|website=www.pflag.org|access-date=2018-10-08}}</ref> Following the 1979 [[National March on Washington for Lesbian and Gay Rights]], representatives from these groups met for the first time in Washington, DC.

By 1980, PFLAG, then known as Parents FLAG, began to distribute information to educational institutions and communities of faith nationwide, establishing itself as a source of information for the general public. When [[Adele Starr]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.pflag.org/2013/03/adele-starr-pflag-los-angeles-and-pflag.html|title=PFLAG National Blog|publisher=PFLAG National|date=2013-03-08}}</ref> who organized the Los Angeles P-FLAG chapter, called "Dear Abby" to discuss the purpose of P-FLAG, "Dear Abby" mentioned PFLAG in one of her advice columns. Los Angeles P-FLAG then received more than 7,500 letters requesting information. Every letter was answered by a member of the chapter. In 1981, members decided to launch a national organization. The first PFLAG office was established in Los Angeles under founding president Adele Starr.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sgn.org/sgnnews38_51/page3.cfm |title=Seattle Gay News - Page 3 - PFLAG pioneer Adele Starr dies at 90 - Friday, December 17, 2010 - Volume 38 Issue 51 |publisher=SGN |date= |accessdate=2015-06-09}}</ref>

In 1982, the Federation of Parents and Friends of Lesbians and Gays, Inc., then representing some 20 groups, was incorporated in California and granted non-profit, tax-exempt status. In 1987, PFLAG relocated to Denver, under President Elinor Lewallen. Also in the 1980s, PFLAG worked to end the US military's efforts to discharge lesbians—more than a decade before military issues came to the forefront of the GLBT movement.  And by the late 1980s, PFLAG began to have notable success in organizing chapters in rural communities.

In 1990, following a period of significant growth, PFLAG employed an Executive Director, expanded its staff, and moved to Washington, DC. Also in 1990, PFLAG President Paulette Goodman sent a letter to Barbara Bush asking for Mrs. Bush's support. The first lady's personal reply stated, "I firmly believe that we cannot tolerate discrimination against any individuals or groups in our country.  Such treatment always brings with it pain and perpetuates intolerance."  Inadvertently given to the Associated Press, her comments caused a political maelstrom and were perhaps the first gay-positive comments to come from the White House.<ref>Evans Rowl, Robert Novak: "[https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/opinions/1990/05/25/bush-and-the-gay-lobby/d64ebb2a-7a59-4b26-8891-afbb7f8cfc65 Bush and the gay Lobby]. ''[[The Washington Post]]'', May 25, 1990</ref>

In time the scope of the organization expanded to include bisexuals, and ultimately, transgender people, but the name remained P-FLAG.<ref>{{cite web|title= History|url= http://community.pflag.org/Page.aspx?pid=267|accessdate= 2012-04-09|url-status= dead|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100617013027/http://community.pflag.org/Page.aspx?pid=267|archivedate= 2010-06-17}}</ref> In particular, in 1998, [[gender identity]], including [[transgender]] people, was added to the mission of PFLAG after a vote at their annual meeting in San Francisco.<ref name="community.pflag.org">{{cite web |url=http://community.pflag.org/Page.aspx?pid=398 |title=PFLAG National |publisher=Community.pflag.org |accessdate=2015-06-09 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120620050818/http://community.pflag.org/Page.aspx?pid=398 |archivedate=2012-06-20 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://community.pflag.org/page.aspx?pid=267 |title=PFLAG: Policy Statements |publisher=PFLAG |accessdate=2010-06-30 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100617013027/http://community.pflag.org/Page.aspx?pid=267 |archivedate=June 17, 2010 }}</ref>
PFLAG was the first national LGBT organization to officially adopt a transgender-inclusive policy for its work, vowing not only to include transgender people in all of its work, but also never to support any policies or laws that are not trans-inclusive.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://community.pflag.org/page.aspx?pid=380 |title=PFLAG National |publisher=Community.pflag.org |accessdate=2015-06-09 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120514141130/http://community.pflag.org/Page.aspx?pid=380 |archivedate=2012-05-14 }}</ref> In 2002, PFLAG's Transgender Network, also known as TNET, became PFLAG's first official "Special Affiliate," recognized with the same privileges and responsibilities as regular chapters.<ref name="community.pflag.org"/> In 2013, TNET was replaced by the Transgender and Gender Nonconforming (TGNC) Advisory Council.

In 2004, PFLAG/Chicago was inducted into the [[Chicago Gay and Lesbian Hall of Fame]] as a Friend of the Community.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.glhalloffame.org/index.pl?page=inductees&todo=year |title=Chicago Gay and Lesbian Hall of Fame |publisher=Glhalloffame.org |accessdate=2015-06-09 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151017032241/http://www.glhalloffame.org/index.pl?page=inductees&todo=year |archivedate=2015-10-17 }}</ref>

In 2013, Jeanne Manford was awarded the [[Presidential Citizens Medal]] by then [[Barack Obama|President Barack Obama]].<ref>{{Citation|last=KL Anderson|title=President Obama Awards the Citizens Medal to Jeanne Manford, Queens, NY, 2/15/2013|date=2013-02-15|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQgFUyvqa-w|accessdate=2017-08-10}}</ref>

In 2013, a bronze plaque was installed at [[The Church of the Village]] in [[Greenwich Village]], memorializing the fact that the first meeting of what came to be PFLAG was held at the church in 1973.<ref name="gvshp.org">{{cite web|last=Berman |first=Andrew |url=http://gvshp.org/blog/2013/06/24/pflag-historic-unveiling-on-a-beautiful-day/#sthash.dbQ5i74j.dpuf |title=PFLAG Historic Plaque Unveiling On A Beautiful Day |publisher=Gvshp.org |date= |accessdate=2015-06-09}}</ref> The plaque reads, "In 1972, Queens schoolteacher [[Jeanne Manford]] walked alongside her gay son, activist Morty Manford, at the 1972 Christopher Street Liberation Day Parade, carrying a sign that read 'Parents of Gays: Unite in Support of Our Children.'<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/05/15/nyregion/morty-manford-41-a-lawyer-and-early-gay-rights-advocate.html|title= Morty Manford, 41, a Lawyer And Early Gay-Rights Advocate ... |accessdate=2020-09-07}}</ref> The overwhelming response to that simple act led Jeanne, her husband Jules, and early pioneers of the LGBT equality movement to create a support group for LGBT people, their parents, family, and friends. The first meeting of that group - now known as PFLAG - took place on this site in March 1973. Placed by the Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation ''in partnership with PFLAG members everywhere, in honor of the legacy of love that began here''".<ref name="gvshp.org" />

In 2017, PFLAG celebrated the 45th anniversary of founder Jeanne Manford's famous march with her son, gay-rights activist Morty Manford.

==Projects==
'' Straight for Equality'' is a national outreach and education project created by PFLAG National to empower new straight allies and trans allies who, unlike a more traditional PFLAG member, don't necessarily have a family or friend connection to the LGBTQ community. The Straight for Equality project was launched in 2007. This nationwide initiative expanded the organization's efforts to include more people in the equality movement than ever before. With almost 40 years of being the "straight voice in the gay movement" no other organization has as successful a track record in educating and empowering parents, families, friends and allies.

Since the 2007 launch, Straight for Equality in the Workplace has been PFLAG's most successful initiative, with an always-developing array of workshops available to corporations in the US. In 2009, PFLAG launched Straight for Equality in Healthcare to educate and engage healthcare providers in all disciplines to be more culturally-inclusive in their work. In 2012, PFLAG launched Straight for Equality in Faith Communities,<ref>http://www.straightforequality.org/Faith</ref> which features faith-focused resources and tools for people of all denominations to start having critical conversations in their faith communities to create more welcoming institutions. And in 2014, PFLAG launched a new trans ally program through Straight for Equality.

Each year since 2009, PFLAG National has held the Straight for Equality Awards Gala, the only awards gala that exclusively celebrates the contributions of straight allies to the movement for LGBT equality.  Past winners include civil rights pioneers like [[Maya Angelou]] and [[Johnnetta B. Cole]]; entertainer [[Liza Minnelli]]; actors [[Rosie Perez]], [[Patrick Stewart]], and [[Sigourney Weaver]]; Broadway stars [[Audra McDonald]] and [[Will Swenson (actor)|Will Swenson]]; sports icons [[Brendon Ayanbadejo]], [[Scott Fujita]], [[Chris Kluwe]], and [[Hudson Taylor]]; authors [[Charlaine Harris]] and [[John Irving]]; faith leaders like [[Jay Bakker]]; and organizations including [[IBM]], [[KPMG]], [[MetLife]], [[Sodexo]], and [[Whirlpool]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.straightforequality.org/gala |title=The Straight for Equality Gala |publisher=Straight For Equality |date=2015-01-22 |accessdate=2015-06-09}}</ref>

''Cultivating Respect: Safe Schools For All'' is PFLAG National's umbrella program to support the efforts of educators, parents, and other trusted adults to make schools safe and inclusive.

''Claim Your Rights'', created in partnership with [[GLSEN]], is a program to help parents, teachers, administrators and other trusted adults file complaints with the [[Office for Civil Rights]] at the [[United States Department of Education|US Department of Education]] on behalf of youth who have experienced school-based bullying, harassment, or discrimination.

==Campaigns==
[[Image:Pride 2004 pflag.jpg|thumb|PFLAG contingent at [[San Francisco]] [[Gay pride|Pride]], 2004]]
In the mid-1990s, ''"Project Open Mind"'' caused some controversy from [[Pat Robertson]]. He threatened to sue PFLAG and any television station that aired the project's ads,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PWQEAAAAMBAJ&q=%22project+open+mind%22+robertson&pg=PT33|title=Making airwaves|last=Gallagher|first=John|date=November 12, 1996|work=The Advocate|pages=30, 32|accessdate=6 September 2012}}</ref> which showed clips of anti-LGBT quotes from several people, including Robertson, [[Jerry Falwell]], and United States Sen.

==Advocacy work==
PFLAG National and the PFLAG chapter network engages in advocacy at the local, state and federal level and has issued public policy statements on a wide variety of issues.{{sfn|Cepek|2008}}<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pflag.org/policystatements|title=Where We Stand; PFLAG National Public Policy Statements|last=|first=|date=|website=PFLAG National|access-date=2017-08-10}}</ref> In the early 1990s, PFLAG chapters in Massachusetts helped pass the first Safe Schools legislation in the country. By the mid-1990s a PFLAG family was responsible for the Department of Education's ruling that Title IX also protected gay and lesbian students from harassment based on sexual orientation. PFLAG put the Religious Right on the defensive, when Pat Robertson threatened to sue any station that carried Project Open Mind advertisements. The resulting media coverage drew national attention to PFLAG's message linking hate speech with hate crimes and LGBT teen suicide.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://community.pflag.org/history |title=PFLAG National |publisher=Community.pflag.org |date=1973-03-26 |accessdate=2015-06-09}}</ref> PFLAG National has been on the front lines to help repeal [[Don't ask, don't tell|Don't Ask, Don't Tell]]; in the fight for marriage equality in the United States—including filing an [[Amicus curiae|amicus brief]] with the United States Supreme Court;<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.supremecourt.gov/ObergefellHodges/AmicusBriefs/14-556_PFLAG_Inc.pdf|title=BRIEF OF PFLAG, INC.

==Outside the United States==
Similarly purposed (and sometimes similarly named) organizations have been established outside the United States since PFLAG's 1972 establishment, although the majority of such organizations are unaffiliated with each other or with the US PFLAG. Most recently, a PFLAG organization in People's Republic of China, [[PFLAG China]] was established in June 2008 by Wu Youjian in Guangzhou after accepting her son's homosexuality.{{Citation needed|date=October 2020}}
