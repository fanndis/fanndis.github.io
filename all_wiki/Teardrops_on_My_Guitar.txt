"'''Teardrops on My Guitar'''" is a song by American singer-songwriter [[Taylor Swift]]. The song was written by Swift and [[Liz Rose]], and produced by [[Nathan Chapman (record producer)|Nathan Chapman]]. "Teardrops on My Guitar" was released on February 19, 2007 by [[Big Machine Records]], as the second [[single (music)|single]] from her [[Taylor Swift (album)|self-titled debut album]] (2006). The song was later included on the international release of Swift's second studio album, ''[[Fearless (Taylor Swift album)|Fearless]]'' (2008), and released as the second pop single from the album in the United Kingdom in 2009. It was inspired by Swift's experience with Drew Hardwick, a classmate of hers for whom she had feelings. He was completely unaware and continually spoke about his girlfriend to Swift, something she pretended to be endeared by. Years afterwards, Hardwick appeared at Swift's house, but Swift rejected him.

Musically, the track is soft and is primarily guided by a gentle [[acoustic guitar]]. Critics have queried the song's classification as [[country music]], with those in agreement (such as Grady Smith of ''[[Rolling Stone]]''<ref>{{cite news|last1=Smith|first1=Grady|title=Teardrops on Her Guitar: Taylor Swift's 10 Countriest Songs|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/teardrops-on-her-guitar-taylor-swifts-10-countriest-songs-20140908|accessdate=6 May 2015|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=8 September 2014}}</ref>) citing the themes and narrative style as country-influenced and those opposed (such as Roger Holland of ''[[PopMatters]]''<ref name="popmatters" />) indicating the [[pop music]] production and instrumentation lack traditional country elements. Critics reacted positively to the track, complimenting Swift's vocal delivery and songwriting style. The song is considered to be Swift's breakthrough single, as it spread her popularity throughout the United States. "Teardrops on My Guitar" was commercially successful, peaking at number 13 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], becoming the best-charting single from ''Taylor Swift'' on the chart, and being Swift's debut entry on the [[Billboard Year-End]] Hot 100 charts. The single was also certified triple platinum by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA).

Its [[music video]] was directed by [[Trey Fanjoy]] and features Swift as she sees her love interest develop a relationship with another female. The video received a nomination for [[MTV Video Music Award for Best New Artist]], but lost to [[Tokio Hotel]]'s music video for "[[Übers Ende der Welt|Ready, Set, Go!]]". The song was promoted through multiple live performances, some while supporting as opening act for various country artists' concert tours. She also performed "Teardrops on My Guitar" on her first headlining tour, the [[Fearless Tour]] (2009–10).

==Background==
Swift was inspired to write "Teardrops on My Guitar" about her experience with a boy named Drew Hardwick, a classmate of hers whom she had feelings for. Hardwick later went on to join the [[United States Navy]]. During their [[freshman year]] at [[Hendersonville High School (Tennessee)|Hendersonville High School]] in be [[Hendersonville, Tennessee]],<ref name="ok">{{cite web |url=http://www.okmagazine.com/2008/04/stars-line-up-at-cmt-awards-6032/ |title=Stars Line Up at CMT Awards |first=Valerie |last=Nome |date=April 23, 2008 |work=[[OK!]] |accessdate=April 13, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110425011143/http://www.okmagazine.com/2008/04/stars-line-up-at-cmt-awards-6032/ |archivedate=April 25, 2011 }}</ref> Swift and Hardwick sat beside each other in class everyday. The two became friends, although Swift secretly desired for them to become a couple. Because of Hardwick's unawareness, he would frequently speak to Swift about another girl he had feelings for, something Swift pretended to be endeared by, commenting, "How beautiful she was, how nice and smart and perfect she was. And I sat there and listened, never meaning it any of the times I said 'Oh, I'm so happy for you.'"<ref name="taylorswift">{{Cite web|url=http://www.taylorswift.com/music#/taylor_swift/teardrops_on_my_guitar|title=My Albums – Taylor Swift – Teardrops on My Guitar|first=Taylor|last=Swift|work=Taylorswift.com|publisher=Big Machine Records|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716194702/http://www.taylorswift.com/music#/taylor_swift/teardrops_on_my_guitar|archivedate=July 16, 2011}}</ref> Hardwick and his crush eventually developed a relationship which lasted for a few years. Swift never confessed her feelings to him. By the release of ''Taylor Swift'', he remained unaware of Swift's intentions or of the song and continued his relationship with the same female.<ref name="taylorswift" /> Upon "Teardrops on My Guitar"'s release as a single, Hardwick attempted to contact Swift via phone calls, which Swift did not respond to; he then left voicemails, but Swift felt too awkward to call back.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.seventeen.com/cosmogirl/meet-taylor-swift-0707|title=Meet Taylor Swift!|date=July 25, 2007|work=[[Seventeen (American magazine)|Seventeen]]|accessdate=April 13, 2011}}</ref>

Two years after the album's release, as she was leaving her house to attend a [[Nashville Predators]] hockey game with [[Kellie Pickler]] and [[Carrie Underwood]], Hardwick appeared at her driveway. A car parked and, out of it, exited Hardwick and a friend of his.<ref name="washingtonpost">{{cite web|url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/postrock/2008/02/her_song_talking_taylor_swift_1.html|title=Her Song: Talking Taylor Swift|first=J.|last=Freedom du Lac|date=February 28, 2008|work=[[The Washington Post]]|accessdate=April 13, 2011}}</ref> After two and a half years of not speaking, the two conversed: "He was like, 'Hey, how's it going?' And I'm like, 'Wow, you're late. Good to see you.' But we were civilized."<ref name="washingtonpost" /> Swift conjectured multiple theories as to why Hardwick appeared at her house. One of them was that he was attempting to prove to his friend that he was indeed the subject of "Teardrops on My Guitar". Other possibilities was that he wanted to rebuild their friendship or believed Swift was still pining away from him.<ref name="washingtonpost" /> Swift said it would have been poetic if he approached her upon the album's release and she would have accepted, but that she had already moved on.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gactv.com/gac/nw_headlines/article/0,,GAC_26063_5827469,00.htm|title=Taylor Swift Dishes on Exes in Blender|date=March 14, 2008|archive-url=https://archive.today/20110926112011/http://www.gactv.com/gac/nw_headlines/article/0,,GAC_26063_5827469,00.htm|archive-date=September 26, 2011|url-status=dead|work=[[Great American Country]]|accessdate=April 13, 2011}}</ref> Swift cited "Teardrops on My Guitar" as an example of how she expresses her sentiments in songs and sometimes in no other manner. She was not afraid of using Hardwick's first name on the track and, therefore, believed it was very honest and susceptible, something she adored.<ref name="taylorswift" />

"Teardrops on My Guitar" has received generally favorable reviews from contemporary critics.  Regarding the song's musical genre, Roger Holland of PopMatters believed there was no reason for Swift to limit herself into only the country music or why she should be a country artist at all. Holland continued, "Yet this is the channel to market she has chosen, and so she has to be prepared to hear complaints about the way that trademarked [[Mutt Lange]] guitar whine has been married to her bright shiny pop songs in order to get them onto [[Country Music Television|CMT]], [[Great American Country|GAC]], and country radio."<ref name="popmatters">{{Cite web|url=http://www.popmatters.com/pm/review/taylor-swift-taylor-swift/|title=Taylor Swift: Taylor Swift|publisher=[[PopMatters]]|first=Roger|last=Holland|date=November 9, 2006|accessdate=January 2, 2011}}</ref> Bill Lamb of [[About.com]] rated "Teardrops on My Guitar" four out of five stars.

The video commences with Drew asking Swift, "Hey, are you gonna go to the game on Friday?" Swift responds, "Well, I was thinking about it. Why?" He then admits it was just curiosity, informs Swift about a girl he met, and walks away. The video then transcends to Swift, wearing a long aquamarine evening gown, lying beside an acoustic guitar on a mattress in a bedroom. She performs the song until the scene transitions to Swift and Drew at the library, where he mocks a novel as she laughs hysterically. The librarian requests for the two to maintain silence, so they converse quietly. Afterwards, Swift is in a chemistry laboratory, where she is mixing substances. Distracted by Drew approaching her, she accidentally pours too much of one substance and causes it to spill. They both rapidly attempt to clean the mess generated. As the song approaches its bridge, Swift and Drew walk towards each other, both smiling, but Drew walks past her and then passionately kisses his girlfriend, as Swift watches in despondently. The video again transcends to the performance scene, where it concludes. Cut-scenes feature Swift lying on the mattress, crying, and standing beside a fireplace in the bedroom.

The video received a nomination for "Number One Streamed Music Video" at the web-hosted 2007 CMT Online Awards, but lost to [[Sugarland]]'s "[[Stay (Sugarland song)|Stay]]" (2007).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cmt.com/microsites/cmt-online-awards/2007/nominees.jhtml|title=CMT Loaded Awards 2007: Country Music Nominees and Video|work=[[Country Music Television|CMT]]|accessdate=June 28, 2010}}</ref> The video received a nomination for [[MTV Video Music Award for Best New Artist]] at the [[2008 MTV Video Music Awards]], but lost to [[Tokio Hotel]]'s video for "[[Übers Ende der Welt|Ready, Set, Go!]]" (2007).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/ontv/vma/2008/|work=[[MTV]]|publisher=Viacom|accessdate=December 21, 2009|title=2008 MTV Video Music Awards – Winners}}</ref> To date, the video has over 142 million views on [[YouTube]].
