'''Feeding America''' is a United States–based nonprofit organization that is a nationwide network of more than 200 [[food bank]]s that feed more than 46 million people through food pantries, soup kitchens, shelters, and other community-based agencies.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.feedingamerica.org/hunger-in-america/our-research/hunger-in-america |title=Hunger in America 2014 |website=Feeding America |access-date=August 27, 2016}}</ref> Forbes ranks it as the second largest U.S. charity by revenue.<ref>{{Cite journal |title=#2 The 100 Largest U.S. Charities 2018 |url=https://www.forbes.com/companies/feeding-america/?list=top-charities |journal=Forbes |access-date=November 8, 2019}}</ref> Feeding America was known as America's Second Harvest until August 31, 2008.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://agwired.com/2008/09/02/second-harvest-heartland-feeding-america |title=Second Harvest Heartland Feeding America |date=September 2, 2008 |website=AgWired: News from the World of Agribusiness |access-date=August 27, 2016}}</ref>

==History==
In the late 1960s, when [[John van Hengel]], a retired businessman in [[Phoenix, Arizona]], began volunteering at a local [[soup kitchen]], he began soliciting food donations for the kitchen. He ended up with far more food than the kitchen could use in its operations. Around this time, he spoke with one of the clients, who told him that she regularly fed her family with discarded items from the grocery store's garbage bins.  She told him that the food quality was fine, but that there should be a place where unwanted food could be stored and later accessed by people who needed it, similar to how banks store money.

Van Hengel began to actively solicit this unwanted food from grocery stores, local gardens, and nearby produce farms.  His effort led to the creation of St. Mary's Food Bank in [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], the nation's first food bank.<ref name="url">{{Cite web |url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/uniontrib/20051009/news_mz1j9passing.html |title=Transitions |date=October 9, 2005 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/5ZU1jNFDI?url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/uniontrib/20051009/news_mz1j9passing.html |archive-date=July 21, 2008 |access-date=July 21, 2008}}</ref>

In 1975, St. Mary's was given a federal grant to assist in developing food banks across the nation.  This effort was formally incorporated into a separate non-profit organization in 1976.<ref name="urlJohn voan Hengel Dies at 83; Founded 1st Food Bank in 1967">{{Cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/10/07/AR2005100701911_2.html |title=John van Hengel Dies at 83; Founded 1st Food Bank in 1967 |last=Patricia Sullivan |date=October 8, 2005 |work=[[The Washington Post]] |access-date=July 21, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/5ZU1xZW3h?url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/10/07/AR2005100701911_2.html |archive-date=July 21, 2008}}</ref>

In 2001, America's Second Harvest merged with Foodchain,<ref name="isbn1-57607-597-4">{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=40Zv8DC4g38C&pg=PA323 |title=Poverty in the United States: an encyclopedia of history, politics, and policy |last=O'Connor, Alice |last2=Mink, Gwendolyn |publisher=ABC-CLIO |year=2004 |isbn=1-57607-597-4 |location=Santa Barbara, Calif |page=389}}</ref> which was the nation's largest food-rescue organization at that time.

In 2005, Feeding America began using an internal market with an artificial currency called "shares" to more rationally allocate food. Currency is allocated based on the need, and then individual banks bid on which foods they want the most, based on local knowledge and ability to transport and store the food offered.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/09/upshot/sending-potatoes-to-idaho-how-the-free-market-helps-food-banks.html |title=Sending Potatoes to Idaho? How the Free Market Can Fight Poverty |last=Sendhil Mullainathan |date=October 7, 2016 |work=The New York Times}}</ref>  Negative prices are possible, so banks could earn shares by picking up undesirable food. The previous centrally planned system had penalized banks for refusing any food offered, even if it was the wrong type to meet their needs, and this resulted in misallocations ("sending potatoes to Idaho"), food rotted away in places that didn't need it, and the wrong types of food being delivered (e.g. not matching hot dogs with hot dog buns).<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2015/11/free-market-food-banks.html |title=Free Market Food Banks |date=November 3, 2015 |website=Marginal REVOLUTION}}</ref>

In August 2009, Columbia Records announced that all U.S. royalties from [[Bob Dylan]]'s album ''Christmas in the Heart'' would be donated to Feeding America, in perpetuity.<ref>Dobuzinskis, Alex (August 26, 2009).

There has been a rise in the numbers suffering from hunger since the [[financial crisis of 2007–2008]]. In 2013, the USDA reported that about 49 million U.S. Americans were facing the condition, about one in six of the population.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ers.usda.gov/media/1565415/err173.pdf |title=Household Food Security in the United States in 2013 |last=Coleman-Jensen |first=Alicia |date=September 2014 |website=United States Department of Agriculture |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160517232254/http://www.ers.usda.gov/media/1565415/err173.pdf |archive-date=May 17, 2016 |access-date=August 27, 2016}}</ref> In September, they launched ''Hunger Action Month'', with events planned all over the nation, to raise awareness and get more U.S. Americans involved in helping out.<ref>[http://www.beloitdailynews.com/news/anti-hunger-efforts-under-way-in-area/article_6fb288aa-f833-11e1-bd3f-0019bb2963f4.html Anti-hunger efforts under way in area ] Beloit daily news.

In 2015, Feeding America saved more than 2&nbsp;billion pounds (~907 thousand [[tonne|metric ton]]s) of food that would have been thrown away otherwise, but could instead be distributed to hungry families.<ref name="Starbucks">{{Cite web |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/starbucks-feeding-america-eliminate-food-waste-perishables/ |title=Starbucks takes action after workers fret over wasted food |publisher=CBS News |access-date=April 25, 2016}}</ref>

In 2018, the USDA announced that food insecurity had been steadily declining since the 2009 recession ended.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/food-nutrition-assistance/food-security-in-the-us/key-statistics-graphics.aspx/ |title=USDA ERS - Key Statistics & Graphics |website=ers.usda.gov}}</ref>

Feeding America's public policy staff works with legislators, conducting research, testifying at hearings and advocating for changes in public attitudes and laws that support Feeding America's network and those the organization serves.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.bbb.org/charity-reviews/national/human-services/feeding-america-in-chicago-il-2331 |title=Charity Report: Feeding America |date=December 2015 |publisher=[[BBB Wise Giving Alliance]] |access-date=August 27, 2016}}</ref>

In 2017, Feeding America announced a plan to increase the nutritional value of food from food banks. By 2023, the group plans to offer more fruits and vegetables, and provide training so they can distribute more produce, whole grains and lean proteins.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/05/12/charities-are-finally-realizing-that-poor-people-also-deserve-healthy-food/ |title=Charities are realizing that poor people also deserve healthy food |last=Dewey, Caitlin |date=May 12, 2017 |access-date=May 14, 2017 |work=The Washington Post}}</ref>
