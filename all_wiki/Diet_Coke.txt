'''Diet Coke''', '''Coca-Cola light''' or '''Light Taste Coca-Cola''' (in [[Benelux|the Benelux]] and Germany) is a [[sugar-free]] and no-calorie [[soft drink]] produced and distributed by [[The Coca-Cola Company]]. It contains artificial sweeteners instead of sugar.

The product quickly overtook the company's existing diet cola, [[Tab (drink)|Tab]], in sales.

== History ==
[[File:Diet-Coke-Can.jpg|thumb|A can of Diet Coke]]
When diet colas first entered the market beginning with [[Diet Rite]], the Coca-Cola Company had a long-standing policy to not use the Coca-Cola name on any product other than the flagship cola, and so its diet cola was named [[Tab (drink)|Tab]] when it was released in 1963. Its rival [[Pepsi]] had no such qualms, and after the long-term success of its sugar-free [[Diet Pepsi]] (launched in 1964) became clear, Coca-Cola decided to launch a competing sugar-free brand under the Coca-Cola name, which could be marketed more easily than Tab, which it did in 1982.

Diet Coke does not use a modified form of the Coca-Cola recipe, but instead an entirely different formula based on the Tab formula. The controversial [[New Coke]], introduced in 1985, used a version of the Diet Coke recipe that contained [[high fructose corn syrup]] and had a slightly different balance of ingredients. In 2005, the company introduced [[Coca-Cola Zero]] (renamed ''Coca-Cola Zero Sugar'' in 2017), a sugar-free formula more closely based on original [[Coca-Cola]].

In 2005, under pressure from retailer [[Walmart]] (which was impressed with the popularity of [[Splenda]] sweetener){{citation needed|date=May 2018}}, the company released a new formulation called "Diet Coke sweetened with Splenda".<ref>"[http://www.thecoca-colacompany.com/presscenter/newproducts_dietcoke_splenda.html Diet Coke Sweetened with Splenda] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100111024321/http://www.thecoca-colacompany.com/presscenter/newproducts_dietcoke_splenda.html |date=January 11, 2010 }}." The Coca-Cola Company. 2009. Web. February 9, 2010.</ref> [[Sucralose]] and [[acesulfame potassium]] replaced aspartame in this version. Early sales were weaker than anticipated; however, Coca-Cola did little advertising for the brand, investing money and advertising in [[Coca-Cola Zero]] instead. By late 2009, some distributors had stopped supplying Diet Coke sweetened with Splenda.

In 2018, in an effort to be more appealing to [[millennials]], Diet Coke was packaged in a taller, more slender can (of the same volume) and introduced four new flavors.<ref>{{cite magazine |author=Klara, Robert |url=http://www.adweek.com/brand-marketing/can-diet-cokes-new-skinny-rainbow-colored-cans-attract-the-millennials-it-covets/ |title=Can Diet Coke's New Skinny, Rainbow-Colored Cans Attract the Millennials It Covets? |magazine=AdWeek |date=January 10, 2018 |accessdate=February 17, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180218091236/http://www.adweek.com/brand-marketing/can-diet-cokes-new-skinny-rainbow-colored-cans-attract-the-millennials-it-covets/ |archive-date=February 18, 2018 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

== Sales ==
Diet Coke and [[Diet Pepsi]] have capitalized on the markets of people who require low sugar regimens, such as [[diabetes mellitus|diabetics]] and people concerned with calorie intake. In the UK, a 330&nbsp;ml can of Diet Coke contains around 1.3 kilocalories (5 kilojoules) compared to 142 kilocalories (595 kJ) for a regular can of Coca-Cola.

==Sweeteners==
Diet Coke was sweetened with [[aspartame]], an artificial sweetener, after the sweetener became available in the United States in 1983.<ref>{{cite news|title=Coke Beginning Aspartame Use |newspaper=New York Times |page=D4 |date=August 18, 1983|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/08/18/business/coke-beginning-aspartame-use.html}}</ref> Early on, to save money, this was also originally in a blend with [[saccharin]]. After [[Diet Rite]] cola advertised its 100 percent use of aspartame, and the manufacturer of [[NutraSweet]] (then [[G. D. Searle & Company]]) warned that the NutraSweet trademark would not be made available to a blend of sweeteners, Coca-Cola switched the formula to 100 percent aspartame. Diet Coke from fountain dispensers still contains some [[saccharin]] to extend shelf life.<ref>{{cite news |author=Ordoñez, Franco |url=https://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2005/03/03/suit_alleges_deceit_in_fountain_diet_cola_drinks/ |title=Suit Alleges Deceit in Fountain Diet Cola Drinks |newspaper=Boston Globe |date=March 3, 2005 |accessdate=August 26, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081007082919/http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2005/03/03/suit_alleges_deceit_in_fountain_diet_cola_drinks/ |archive-date=October 7, 2008 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref>
