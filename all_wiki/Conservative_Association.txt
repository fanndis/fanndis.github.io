A '''Conservative Association (CA)''' is a local organisation composed of [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] members in the [[United Kingdom]]. Every association varies in membership size but all correspond to a parliamentary constituency in [[England]], [[Wales]], [[Scotland]] and [[Northern Ireland]]. An executive council of officers are elected every year at an annual general meeting who represent electoral wards in their local areas and are designated with specified responsibilities.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.conservatives.com/members/party-structure-and-organisation|title=Party Structure and Organisation|website=Conservatives.com|accessdate=14 January 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161005230159/https://www.conservatives.com/Members/Party-Structure-and-Organisation|archive-date=5 October 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> University Conservative associations are run independently from constituency associations. A major role comes  in the form of fund-raising, campaigning, and the selection of candidates to compete in local and parliamentary elections. The first associations were formed as early as 1832.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Conservative-Party-political-party-United-Kingdom|title=Conservative Party - History, Facts, Policy, & Structure|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|accessdate=14 January 2019}}</ref>
