Ten days prior to the ceremony, Recording Academy president [[Deborah Dugan]] was relieved of her duties as president and CEO and placed on administrative leave from the organization. She sparked controversy by claiming that the organization engaged in corruption and favoritism; Champagne Billecart-Salmon pulled their ads and [[Megyn Kelly]], [[Gabrielle Union]], and others tweeted their support of Dugan.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/ousted-recording-academy-chief-given-security-detail-disturbing-threat-says-lawyer-1270972|title=Ousted Recording Academy Chief Given Security Detail After "Disturbing" Threat, Says Lawyer &#124; Hollywood Reporter|website=www.hollywoodreporter.com}}</ref> The ceremony was held on the same day as the [[2020 Calabasas helicopter crash|death]] of basketball player [[Kobe Bryant]], to which Keys and [[Boyz II Men]] dedicated their performance of "[[It's So Hard to Say Goodbye to Yesterday]]" in his memory.

==Background and controversy==
After many years of being traditionally held in February (except during the years of the [[Winter Olympic Games|Winter Olympics]]), the 62nd Grammy Awards ceremony was moved to January the week before [[Super Bowl LIV]], following the [[Academy Awards]]' decision to move their [[92nd Academy Awards|2020 ceremony]] to the second Sunday of February.<ref name="deadline2018"/><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.showbiz411.com/2018/08/08/oscars-vs-grammys-academy-awards-takes-traditional-grammy-award-date-for-2020|title=Grammy Awards Furious Oscars Ambushed Them on Traditional Date: "It was a very disrespectful move on their part"1/2/3/4/5/10/the End on|date=August 8, 2018|website=Showbiz411|access-date=February 25, 2019}}</ref> Nominations were announced in all 84 categories by [[Gayle King]], [[Alicia Keys]] and [[Bebe Rexha]] on the set of ''[[CBS This Morning]]'' on November 20, 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.grammy.com/grammys/news/2020-grammy-awards-complete-nominees-list|title=2020 GRAMMY Awards: Complete Nominees List|publisher=National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences|access-date=November 20, 2019}}</ref>

This was set to be the first edition of the Grammy Awards that the new Recording Academy president [[Deborah Dugan]] would have presided over; however, she was relieved of her duties as president and CEO and placed on administrative leave from the organization ten days before the ceremony. The Academy launched an investigation into allegations that Dugan bullied an assistant.<ref name="Vox">{{Cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/2020/1/26/21082057/2020-grammys-sexual-harassment-corruption-recording-academy-deborah-dugan-rigged-nominations|title=The 2020 Grammys' sexual harassment and corruption controversy, explained|first=Alex|last=Abad-Santos|date=January 26, 2020|access-date=January 27, 2020|website=[[Vox (website)|Vox]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200127165756/https://www.vox.com/2020/1/26/21082057/2020-grammys-sexual-harassment-corruption-recording-academy-deborah-dugan-rigged-nominations|archive-date=January 27, 2020}}</ref> After her dismissal, Dugan sparked controversy by claiming that the Recording Academy engaged in favoritism and corruption during the Grammy nomination process.<ref name="Vox"/><ref name="auto1">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/16/arts/music/grammys-deborah-dugan-misconduct.html|title=Grammys Leader Deborah Dugan Removed 10 Days Before Ceremony|last=Sisario|first=Ben|date=January 16, 2020|work=The New York Times|access-date=January 27, 2020|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> [[Taylor Swift]] reportedly cancelled a planned surprise performance of her song "[[The Man (Taylor Swift song)|The Man]]" at the ceremony in solidarity with Dugan,<ref name="Vox"/> although both Swift and Grammys producer [[Ken Ehrlich]] denied this.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2020/01/grammys-taylor-swift-phone-call|title=Why Are the Grammys Suddenly Lashing Out at Taylor Swift?|first1=Erin|last1=Vanderhoof|date=January 31, 2020|work=Vanity Fair|access-date=February 1, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/2019/music/news/deborah-dugan-succeed-neil-portnow-recording-academy-1203188796/|title=Ken Ehrlich on How Grammys Handled Academy Scandal and Kobe's Death— and Hugging It Out With Ariana Grande|first1=Chris|last1=Willman|date=January 27, 2020|work=Variety|access-date=February 1, 2020}}</ref> Recording Academy Chairman [[Harvey Mason Jr.]] took over as interim president and chief executive officer and presided over the ceremony instead of Dugan.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/music/story/2020-01-16/grammys-deborah-dugan-recording-academy-fired|title=Ousted Grammys chief: 'We will expose what happens when you "step up" at the Recording Academy'|last=Lewis|first=Randy|date=January 17, 2020|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|url-status=live|access-date=January 27, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/2019/music/news/deborah-dugan-succeed-neil-portnow-recording-academy-1203188796/|title=Deborah Dugan to Succeed Neil Portnow as Recording Academy Chief|first1=Jem|last1=Aswad|date=April 13, 2019|work=Variety|access-date=June 12, 2019}}</ref>

The ceremony was held at the Staples Center on the same day as the [[Death of Kobe Bryant|death]] of basketball player [[Kobe Bryant]], who played for the [[Los Angeles Lakers]] — the arena is the team's home venue. Several tributes to Bryant were included in the ceremony, including a performance of "[[It's So Hard to Say Goodbye to Yesterday]]" by host [[Alicia Keys]] and [[Boyz II Men]], while [[Lil Nas X]], [[Lizzo]] and [[DJ Khaled]] all incorporated tributes to Bryant into their performances.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Whitten |first1=Sarah |title='Heartbroken in the house that Kobe Bryant built': Lakers legend remembered at Grammys |url=https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/26/grammys-2020-kobe-bryant-remembered-at-grammy-performers.html |publisher=CNBC |access-date=January 27, 2020  |date=January 27, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Vanderhoof |first1=Erin |title=Grammys 2020: Lil Nas X, DJ Khaled, the Jonas Brothers, and More Pay Tribute to Kobe Bryant |url=https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2020/01/grammy-awards-tribute-to-kobe-bryant |website=Vanity Fair |access-date=January 27, 2020 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/jan/27/2020-grammys-billie-eilish-recording-academy |title =Grammys 2020: Billie Eilish's triumph overshadowed but well-deserved|date=January 27, 2020|work=The Guardian|access-date=January 27, 2020}}</ref>

===Category changes===

For the 62nd Annual Grammy Awards, multiple category changes were made.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/awards/8516731/the-recording-academy-will-now-accept-streaming-links-in-most-grammy|title=The Recording Academy Will Now Accept Streaming Links in Most Grammy Category Submissions|website=Billboard}}</ref>

* As of the 62nd Grammy Awards, the Recording Academy would accept links to streaming services as opposed to physical copies as submissions. The Academy stated: "For most categories, we would prefer streaming distribution links for online entry submissions, though CD submissions remain optional". As justification for this development, the Academy highlighted the changing music industry and added that submitting links was more convenient and cost effective, especially for smaller and independent labels.
* Additionally, there were separate screening committees for Pop and Rock, whereas previously these categories were screened by a Core Committee. This leaves the Core Committee to focus on the more difficult decisions such as determining who is eligible for the [[Grammy Award for Best New Artist|Best New Artist]] category and trying to find the best home for borderline genre entries.
* The definition of the [[Grammy Award for Best Traditional Pop Vocal Album]] had been expanded to accept "contemporary pop songs performed in traditional pop style – the term "traditional" being a reference to the style of the composition, vocal styling and the instrumental arrangement without regard to the age of the material". The Academy stated that broadening the category was done in an attempt to allow it to "remain robust and inclusive" and enable it to be more competitive as, for example, [[Tony Bennett]] has won the award 13 times.
* Spoken word recordings targeted at children had been moved from the [[Grammy Award for Best Children's Album|Best Children's Album]] category to the [[Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album|Best Spoken Word Album]].
* As of the 62nd Grammy Awards, Spanish-language Latin Gospel and Christian music would be officially welcomed in the [[Grammy Award for Best Gospel Album|Best Gospel Album]], [[Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Christian Music Album|Best Contemporary Christian Music Album]], [[Grammy Award for Best Roots Gospel Album|Best Roots Gospel Album]], [[Grammy Award for Best Gospel Performance/Song|Best Gospel Performance/Song]] and [[Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Christian Music Performance/Song|Best Contemporary Christian Music Performance/Song]] categories.
