'''Thyagaraya Nagar''', commonly known as '''T. Nagar''', is a very affluent commercial and residential neighbourhood in [[Chennai]], [[Tamil Nadu]], India. It is surrounded by [[Nungambakkam]] in the North, [[Teynampet]] in the East, [[Nandanam]] in the South-East, [[C.I.T Nagar]] (a part of Greater Nandanam region) in the South and [[West Mambalam]] and [[Kodambakkam]] in the West. The stretch between Duraiswamy Road and T. Nagar Bus Stand has some of the costliest real estates in Chennai. It was constructed between 1923 and 1925 by the Madras Presidency government of the [[Raja of Panagal]] as a part of town planning activities initiated according to the Madras Town Planning Act of 1920. The town was named after [[P. Theagaraya Chetty|P. Thyagaraya Chetty]]. The streets, parks and localities in the new neighbourhood were named after important officials in the provincial government.

T. Nagar is believed to be the first planned urban neighborhood in Chennai created in 1920, conceived in a European style, with the [[Panagal Park]] resembling the [[Arc De Triomphe]] and the [[Pondy Bazaar]] resembling the [[Champs-Élysées]] in [[Paris]].<ref name="TH_TnagarNears100">{{cite news

Initially built as a residential neighbourhood, it is now considered the [[List of shopping streets and districts by city|largest shopping district]] in India by revenue.<ref name="ET_TNagarToGetARetailMakeover"/> It is known for its plethora of saree and jewellery retailers, including [[Pothys]], [[Nalli Silks]] and [[Saravana Stores]]. The neighbourhood is served by [[Mambalam railway station]] of the [[Chennai Suburban Railway Network]]. T. Nagar is considered one of the city's major [[central business district]]s, the other being [[Parry's Corner]], the centre of the city. [[Pondy Bazaar]] serves as a satellite commercial hub for T. Nagar, located around the Thyagaraya Road.

==Location and geography==
[[File:Tnagar.jpg|thumb|right|Map of T. Nagar]]
T. Nagar is located about 10&nbsp;km from [[Chennai Airport]] and about 8&nbsp;km from [[Chennai Central]] railway station. It lies to the west of the arterial [[Anna Salai]] (Mount Road) and is loosely bordered by [[Saidapet]] to the south and southwest, [[West Mambalam]] to the west, [[Kodambakkam]] to the northwest, [[Nandanam]] to the south, [[Nungambakkam]] to the north, and [[Teynampet]] to the east. T. Nagar is usually associated with [[Mambalam]], a common name for the entire area of Thyagaraya Nagar, West Mambalam, [[C.I.T. Nagar]] and Pondy Bazaar. [[Panagal Park]] is located at the centre of the neighbourhood connecting five vein-roads of the neighbourhood: North Usman Road, South Usman Road, G.N. Chetty Road, Thyagaraya Road and Venkatanarayana Road.

==History==
[[File:T. Nagar club.jpg|thumb|right|Thyagaraya Nagar social club]]
Until the turn of the 19th century, the villages to the west of [[Mount Road]] formed a part of [[Chingleput District (Madras Presidency)|Chingleput District]]. The [[Long Tank, Madras|Long Tank]], which formed the western frontier of the city, was drained out in 1923.<ref>''Madras Rediscovered'' by S.Muthiah</ref> That very same year, the administration of the Mambalam zamindari, situated to the west of the Long Tank, was relinquished by its hereditary chief. The region had several paddy fields.<ref name="ET_TNagarToGetARetailMakeover">{{cite news | last = Malviya | first = Sagar |author2=Sangeetha Kandavel | title = India's biggest shopping district Theagaraya Nagar in Chennai to get a retail makeover | newspaper = The Economic Times | location = Chennai | publisher = The Times Group | date = 7 February 2013 | url = http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2013-02-07/news/36972296_1_t-nagar-panagal-park-theagaraya-nagar | access-date = 9 February 2013}}</ref> During 1923–25, the township of "Thiyagaraya Nagar" named after [[Sir P. Theagaraya Chetty|Sir P.T. Thyagaraya Chetty]] was carved out of the southern part of the erstwhile Mambalam zamindari. A park was developed at the centre of this new locality and was named in honour of the then Chief Minister, as Panagal Park. Soon afterwards, [[Pondy Bazaar]] began to make its appearance. According to historian [[S. Muthiah]], it was initially known as 'Soundarapandia Bazaar' after Justice Party politician [[W. P. A. Soundarapandian Nadar]].<ref name="HinduBL_ShopTillYouDrop"/> A well-planned residential area was created. Most of the streets in the new locality were named after provincial cabinet ministers, Justice Party bosses or officials in the administration.

The laying of suburban railway line from [[Egmore]] to [[Kanchipuram|Kancheepuram]] in 1911 resulted in a station at Mambalam. The first bank of the locality was opened in 1935, followed by a second one, the [[Indian Bank]], in 1937.<ref name="HinduBL_ShopTillYouDrop"/> Retail industry started proliferating in the region with the establishment of Nalli Chinnasami Chetty's textile showroom in 1928,<ref name="ET_TNagarToGetARetailMakeover"/> which was upgraded as the first Kancheepuram silk sari shop of the area in 1935.<ref name="HinduBL_ShopTillYouDrop"/> During the [[Second World War]], the city was evacuated due to the fear of Japanese bombing. All the shops were closed and the economic activity was halted for a few days that followed.<ref name="HinduBL_ShopTillYouDrop"/>

The reason behind the naming of Pondy Bazaar still remains controversial.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thehindu.com/features/downtown/once-upon-a-time-in-thyagaraya-nagar/article3436296.ece|title=Once upon a time in Thyagaraya Nagar…|last=Keerthana|first=R.|date=2012-05-01|work=The Hindu|access-date=2018-08-11|language=en-IN|issn=0971-751X}}</ref> According to one version, Devaraj Mudaliar of [[Pondicherry (city)|Pondicherry]] opened 10 shops on Sir Thyagaraya Road and started calling it Pondy Bazaar. Madras historian S. Muthiah, in his book ''Madras Rediscovered'', claims that the area was originally known as Soundarapandia Bazaar, which the government retained without change. Save for two of the streets, which were named after two workmen, Nagamani and Govindan, who died while digging trenches for the new drainage system in the locality, all the tree-lined streets were named after the stalwarts of the then ruling Justice Party.<ref name="HinduBL_ShopTillYouDrop"/>

Star-rated hotels started appearing in the locality with the opening of a three-star hotel named Residency in 1991. As of 2006, there were seven hotels with over 80 per cent occupancy rates. Some of the well established and popular restaurants are Hotel Saravana Bhavan,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.saravanabhavan.com/|title=Saravanaa Bhavan - Home|website=www.saravanabhavan.com|access-date=2016-03-05}}</ref> Adyar Ananda Bhavan,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.aabsweets.in/|title=Adyar Ananda Bhavan Sweets and Snacks {{!}} Tamil Nadu {{!}} Karnataka|last=http://www.aabsweets.in/|website=www.aabsweets.in|access-date=2016-03-05}}</ref> Mansuk,etc., With the increase in retail activities in the neighbourhood, several famous theatres such as Sun, Nagesh, and Rajakumari have given way to commercial complexes.<ref name="HinduBL_ShopTillYouDrop"/>

From its early days, Thiyagaraya Nagar remained one of the most preferred residential localities in the city. The population grew exponentially during the 1930s. In its early days, film artists such as [[M. K. Thyagaraja Bhagavathar]], [[T. R. Rajakumari]], [[N. S. Krishnan]], [[Vyjayanthimala]], [[N. T. Rama Rao]], [[K. A. Thangavelu|Thangavelu]], [[Manorama (Tamil actress)|Manorama]], [[Savitri (actress)|Savitri]], [[Sivaji Ganesan]] and [[T. S. Balaiah]] set up their residences here.<ref name="thehindu_20090422">{{cite news|title=Memories of Madras: Of shady avenues and street poets|work=The Hindu|url=http://www.hindu.com/mp/2009/04/22/stories/2009042250040100.htm|author=Prince Frederick|date=22 April 2009}}</ref>

==Demographics==
T.Nagar's [[bazaar]]s are frequented by a number of shoppers. On a typical weekend, the number of people who move about on Pondy Bazaar, the suburb's principal commercial area, might soar up to 500,000. During festival season, because of the discounts and reductions offered by dealers of silk sarees and jewellers, this number might reach 2 million.<ref>{{cite news

The neighbourhood is considered to be the biggest shopping district in India by revenue.<ref name="ET_TNagarToGetARetailMakeover"/> There are a number of [[apparel]], jewellery and [[Kitchen utensil|utensil]] stores based in Thiyagaraya Nagar. By some estimates, the shops in the neighbourhood together accounts for revenues of nearly {{INR}} 20,000 crores annually. However, official estimates put it much lower at over {{INR}} 10,000 crores, which is still double that of New Delhi's [[Connaught Place, New Delhi|Connaught Place]] and [[Mumbai]]'s Linking Road which account for about {{INR}} 4,000 to 6,000 crores annually.<ref name="ET_TNagarToGetARetailMakeover"/> The neighbourhood accounts for about 70 to 80% of the gold sold in Chennai, the most important gold market in [[South India]].<ref name="HinduBL_ShopTillYouDrop">{{cite news

==Society==
T. Nagar residents are an unusual mix of the traditional and the modern and this is reflected in the way the neighbourhood has been growing. Several new eateries have come up while at the same time, traditional restaurants are also packed. With the city extending its bed-time more every year, the locality has acquired a reputation of always being in the fast lane. The grand textile showrooms close very late at night, and their hoarding boards constantly illuminate the roads.

Early in the morning, joggers and walkers take full advantage of the empty roads, with the fresh air that's so hard to come by in this area at all other times of the day. Panagal Park, Natesan Park and Jeeva Park all have their regular crowd and their walkers' associations are extremely active. T. Nagar is also a place of musical intellects. A lot of sabhas are very active during the month of December.

===State assembly politics===
{{main|Thiyagaraya Nagar (State Assembly Constituency)}}
T. Nagar is known for voting against the trend, voting against the winning party, on 5 separate occasions, since [[1962 Madras legislative assembly election|1962 assembly elections]]. It has also become a critical swing constituency since it has become increasingly closer in recent years. It is worth noting that in the 2006 election, AIADMK was able to significantly increase their vote share, winning with a margin of 10.8%. This is mostly due to the high satisfaction of the [[J.Jayalalithaa]] government from 2001 to 2006, due to significant development that took place in that time period in the T. Nagar area.
* Note: In 1989, AIADMK was split between [[Janaki Ramachandran|Janaki faction]] and [[J. Jayalalithaa|Jayalalithaa faction]], and only the Jayalalithaa faction is reported in the AIADMK column since they were the highest vote-gainers from the divided faction. The Janaki faction got 8,268, which is about 7.2% of the voters.

===Lok Sabha politics===

==Pedestrian plaza==
A {{INR}} 338-million pedestrian plaza was planned in 2013 by the city corporation. It involves provision of a pedestrian-friendly footpath on the 1.45&nbsp;kilometre-long stretch of the Theyagaraya Road between Panagal Park and Anna Salai.<ref name="TOI_BeginsPlazaWork">{{cite news | last = Kumar | first = Pradeep | title = Chennai Corporation begins work on T Nagar pedestrian plaza | newspaper = The Times of India| location = Chennai | publisher = The Times Group

The plaza will be divided into three stretches with different identities. A 12-metre wide pedestrian space will be developed in the 730-metre stretch from Panagal Park to the Thanikachalam Road junction.<ref name="Hindu_WorkOnPlazaBegins">{{cite news | title = Work on T.

Upon completion, only city buses and motorcycles will be permitted in this area in a 7-metre carriageway. All types of vehicles will be allowed on the 370-m stretch from Thanikachalam Road to the Boag Road junction, where the pedestrian plaza will be only 3.5&nbsp; metres wide and carriageway will be comparatively wider measuring 15&nbsp; metres. All vehicles will be permitted on the 350-metre stretch between the Boag Road junction to the Anna Salai junction.<ref name="Hindu_WorkOnPlazaBegins"/>

The proposal for a cycle track has been replaced with a plan to introduce battery-operated cars. A multi-level car parking lot has also been planned. Other facilities in the plaza include seating, public toilet and a children's play area.<ref name="Hindu_WorkOnPlazaBegins"/>

==Future==
In 2013, to address the traffic concerns of the neighbourhood, [[Chennai Corporation]] tied up with real estate advisory firm Jones Lang LaSalle to exercise a proposal to redevelop the area, especially the shopping centres.<ref name="ET_TNagarToGetARetailMakeover"/> T. Nagar will also be the site for the [[Smart Cities Mission|Smart City Mission]] in Chennai as per the Government data.<ref>{{cite news|title=T NAGAR will be Chennai's test site for smart city plan|url= http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/T-NAGAR-will-be-Chennais-test-site-for-smart-city-plan/articleshow/50212255.cms|access-date=17 December 2015}}</ref>
