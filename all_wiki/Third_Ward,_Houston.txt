'''Third Ward''' is an area of [[Houston]], [[Texas]], [[United States]] that evolved from one of the [[The six wards of Houston|six historic wards]] of the same name. It is located in the [[southeast Houston]] management district.

Third Ward, located inside the [[610 Loop]] is immediately southeast of [[Downtown Houston]] and to the east of the [[Texas Medical Center]]. The ward became the center of Houston's [[African-American]] community. Third Ward is nicknamed "The Tre”.<ref>{{cite news|author=George, Cindy|url=http://www.chron.com/houston/article/33-6-million-Emancipation-Park-redo-unveiled-11227617.php|title=Community celebrates $33.6M makeover of Houston's Emancipation Park|newspaper=[[Houston Chronicle]]|date=2017-06-17|access-date=2017-07-25}} [[Sylvester Turner]] stated: "[...]stopped off in Freedman's Town — Fourth Ward — transferred over to Third Ward, the Tre, then migrated to Fifth Ward — the Nickel — didn't stay there,[...]"</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=Osborn, Altamese|url=http://www.houstonpress.com/arts/whats-the-new-news-challenges-medias-third-ward-assumptions-6392537|title=What's The New News?

==History==
[[File:HeinenTheaterHCCSHouston.JPG|thumb|left|[[Congregation Beth Israel (Houston, Texas)|Temple Beth Israel]], now the Heinen Theater, was a part of Third Ward]]
Soon after the 1836 establishment of Houston, the City Council established four wards as political subdivisions of the city.<ref name="Wood71"/> The original Third Ward district extended south of Congress Street and east of Main Street and ended at the north shore of the Brays Bayou; what was then the district includes what is today portions of [[Downtown Houston]] and [[Midtown Houston]] in addition to residential African-American area currently identified as Third Ward, which is located southeast of [[Downtown Houston]]. As of 2003 the usage of the land within the boundaries of the historic Third Ward is more diverse than the land usage in the current Third Ward.<ref name="Wood72">Wood, Roger.

In the 1800s much of what was Third Ward, the present day east side of [[Downtown Houston]], was what Stephen Fox, an architectural historian who lectured at [[Rice University]], referred to as "the elite neighborhood of late 19th-century Houston."{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}} Ralph Bivins of the ''[[Houston Chronicle]]'' said that Fox said<!--While Fox actually said it, the wording is Bivins'--> that area was "a silk-stocking neighborhood of Victorian-era homes." Bivins said that the construction of Union Station, which occurred around 1910, caused the "residential character" of the area to "deteriorate." Hotels opened in the area to service travelers. Afterwards, according to Bivins, the area "began a long downward slide toward the skid row of the 1990s" and the hotels were changed into flophouses. Passenger trains stopped going to Union Station.<ref>Bivins, Ralph.

Historically White people lived in the southern part of Third Ward, while African Americans were economically segregated and lived north of Truxillo Street. By the 1930s the White and Black populations of Third Ward were about even. After [[World War II]] White residents and the [[Congregation Beth Israel (Houston, Texas)|Temple Beth Israel]] moved from Third Ward to newly developed suburbs on the southwest side, and Third Ward became mostly African-American.<ref name="Wood73">Wood, Roger.

In the 1960s and 1970s many families in Third Ward relocated to racially integrated suburbs; racial integration allowed many Blacks to move to the suburbs, therefore Third Ward lost some of its population with decades of neglect and economic traffic. Despite the relocations the Almeda Road commercial corridor remained busy. Kent Hadnot, the executive director of Third Ward Redevelopment Council, said in a 2000 ''[[Houston Press]]'' article that [[blockbusting]] beginning in the 1970s began to drive homeowners and business owners away from the Third Ward and into suburbs such as [[Missouri City, Texas|Missouri City]].

According to Hughes, the eastern boundary is a low rent group of houses near [[Texas Southern University]] that he refers to as "Sugar Hill." Wood says that among area musicians, Third Ward's boundaries are usually thought of as extending southward from the junction of [[Interstate 45]] (Gulf Freeway) and [[Interstate 69]]/[[U.S. Route 59]] (Southwest Freeway) to the Brays Bayou, with Main Street forming the western boundary.<ref name="Wood72"/>

In 1995 T. R. Witcher of the ''[[Houston Press]]'' reported that the Third Ward, as defined by Third Ward Redevelopment Council, "may be the most variegated community in Houston."<ref name="Witcher1"/> Witcher described the area west of [[Texas Southern University]], "the heart of the Third Ward," as having "blocks of sturdy, well-tended brick houses," and being the "home" to the "diminished but still-viable base of middle-class and working-class homeowners and renters" of the area.<ref name="Witcher1"/> The brick houses, south of Truxillo are larger and, in the words of Roger Wood, author of ''[[Down in Houston: Bayou City Blues]]'', "nicer" than the housing stock north of Truxillo. Throughout the history of Third Ward, African Americans gradually occupied the brick houses. As of 2003 the brick houses are in varying conditions; Woods said that some are "beautifully renovated," some are "respectfully maintained," and some are "severely neglected."<ref name="Wood72"/>

Witcher described the northern part of Third Ward, which in his view "more than any other in Third Ward, call to mind the word '[[ghetto]],' Houston-style," as having "rows of shotgun shacks, worn frame houses and fraying apartments" owned by absentee landlords.<ref name="Witcher1"/> The section included crime, families affected by welfare dependency, unemployment, and proliferation of recreational drugs. In the summer residents of that area who wanted to cool down from the summer heat sat on porches and visited friends on the streets. The Third Ward area included many churches of varying sizes; some churches still attracted members who lived in [[Missouri City, Texas|Missouri City]] and other suburbs.<ref name="Witcher1"/> The shotgun shacks, located north of Truxillo Street, are smaller and more cheaply built than the houses, and they have been historically occupied by working class African Americans. Some shotgun shacks have been continually occupied, and some shotgun shacks have been abandoned; some of the abandoned shotgun shacks have been boarded up.<ref name="Wood72"/>

Some of the drops in crime rate may be related to the fact that the City of Houston, the University of Houston, and other private companies are cleaning up the area through construction. A prime example of this is the Campus Vue apartment complex off North MacGregor Way and Calhoun Road. Other companies like Fountain Residential Partners and [http://assetcampushousing.com/ Asset Campus Housing], who have decided to build off-campus boutique dorms in the area, are receiving tax abatement and government support for building in a high poverty area.

[[Project Row Houses]] (PRH) is a community-based arts and culture non-profit organization in Houston's northern Third Ward, one of the city's oldest African-American neighborhoods. It was founded in 1993 by artist and community activist [[Rick Lowe]], along with James Bettison (1991), [[Bert Long, Jr.]] (1940-2013), [[Jesse Lott]], Floyd Newsum, Bert Samples, and George Smith, all seeking to establish a positive, creative and transformative presence in this historic community. Inspired by both the American artist Dr. [[John T. Biggers]] (1924-2001) and the German artist Josef Beuys (1921-1986), PRH is a unique experiment in activating the intersections between art, historic preservation, affordable and innovative housing, community relations and development, neighborhood revitalization, and human empowerment.

And even African-American state District Judge John C. Creuzot, who was not on the ballot this year and is the lone surviving Democratic minority on the bench, says a party switch "is always a possibility."[...]Creuzot, who hails from Houston's Third Ward and whose mother, Sally, still operates Frenchy's Chicken on Scott and Wheeler, boils down the Harris County dilemma to a historical alignment of minorities to the Democratic Party that is hard to sever."</ref>
