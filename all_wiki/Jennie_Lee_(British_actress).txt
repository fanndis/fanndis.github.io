''Jo'' ran for many months at the Globe and other London venues before embarking for several seasons on tours of the British Isles, a return to North America, tours of Australia and New Zealand and later revivals in Britain.

Emily Lee was born in London, the daughter of Edwin George Lee, an artist of some note who worked in the mediums of [[watercolor|watercolour]] and [[wood engraving]].<ref>Kumm, Elisabeth, "[https://theatreheritage.org.au/on-stage-magazine/general-articles/item/537-jennie-lee-and-bleak-house Jennie Lee and Bleak House]", theatreheritage.org.au.

Lee would sometimes accompany her father to the latter's studio where, on occasion. she would sit for the artist; as did her maternal aunt, Anne Ryan, the young woman depicted in his painting, [[A Huguenot]].<ref name= "LMAP-A"/>

Lee was raised in a large household that included seven siblings and her father's younger brothers, whom she liked to call "her three wicked uncles". Lee once described her father as austere and that what fun she found as a child often occurred surreptitiously or while he was away on one of his frequent painting excursion. Often during these absences she would sneak into her father's library to read books normally forbidden to her or organise family plays with the help of her three uncles.<ref name= "LMAP-A"/>

In the fall of 1869, some eighteen months after her father's death, Lee made her stage debut at London's [[Lyceum Theatre (London)|Lyceum Theatre]] as one of the twelve [[Page (servant)|page]]s in ''[[Chilpéric (operetta)|Chilpéric]]'', an [[opéra bouffe]] with libretto and music by [[Hervé (composer)|Hervé]].
