'''''The Seattle Times''''' is a daily newspaper serving [[Seattle]], Washington, United States. It was founded in 1891 and has been controlled by the Blethen family since 1896. ''The Seattle Times'' has the largest circulation of any newspaper in [[Washington state]] and the [[Pacific Northwest]] region.

The newspaper is owned by [[The Seattle Times Company]], which also owns local newspapers in [[Walla Walla, Washington|Walla Walla]] and [[Yakima, Washington|Yakima]]. ''The Seattle Times'' had a longstanding rivalry with the ''[[Post-Intelligencer]]'' newspaper until the latter ceased publication in 2009.

==History==
''The Seattle Times'' originated as the '''''Seattle Press-Times''''', a four-page newspaper founded in 1891 with a daily [[Newspaper circulation|circulation]] of 3,500, which [[Maine]] teacher and attorney [[Alden J. Blethen]] bought in 1896.<ref name="overview">{{cite web |url=http://www.seattletimescompany.com/communication/overview.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140131022007/http://www.seattletimescompany.com/communication/overview.htm |archive-date=January 31, 2014 |title=Overview of the Seattle Times |work=The Seattle Times }}</ref><ref>{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.historylink.org/essays/output.cfm?file_id=7896 |title=The Seattle Times publishes its first edition edited by new co-owner Alden J.

The newspaper moved to the [[Times Square Building]] at 5th Avenue and Olive Way in 1915. It built a new headquarters, the [[Seattle Times Building]], north of Denny Way in 1930. The paper moved to its current headquarters at 1000 Denny Way in 2011.

''The Seattle Times'' switched from afternoon delivery to mornings on March 6, 2000, citing that the move would help them avoid the fate of other defunct afternoon newspapers.<ref>[http://www.ajr.org/article_printable.asp?id=73 ''American Journalism Review'': 40 Years Of Death In The Afternoon] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060330063606/http://www.ajr.org/article_printable.asp?id=73 |date=March 30, 2006 }}</ref> This placed the ''Times'' in direct competition with its [[Joint Operating Agreement]] (JOA) partner, the morning ''[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]''.<ref>{{cite news |date=March 5, 2000 |title=Seattle Times Shifts to Mornings |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/03/05/us/seattle-times-shifts-to-mornings.html |newspaper=The New York Times |accessdate=January 28, 2016}}</ref> Nine years later, the ''Post-Intelligencer'' became an online-only publication.<ref name="PI-2009">{{cite news |last=Pérez-Peña |first=Richard |date=March 11, 2009 |title=As Cities Go From Two Papers to One, Talk of Zero |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/12/business/media/12papers.html?pagewanted=all |newspaper=The New York Times |accessdate=January 28, 2016}}</ref>

==Controversies==
===Racial headline controversy===
In February 2002, ''The Seattle Times'' ran a subheadline "American outshines Kwan, [[Irina Slutskaya|Slutskaya]] in skating surprise" after [[Sarah Hughes]] won the gold medal at the [[Figure skating at the 2002 Winter Olympic Games|2002 Olympics]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Chang|first1=Iris|title=The Chinese in America: A Narrative History|date=2003|publisher=[[Penguin Books]]|isbn=978-1-101-12687-5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1a7gXiXnKF0C&pg=PT283|accessdate=February 20, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|editor1-last=Tewari|editor1-first=Nita|editor2-last=Alvarez|editor2-first=Alvin N.|title=Asian American Psychology: Current Perspectives|date=2009|publisher=[[Taylor & Francis|Taylor & Francis Group]]|page=421|isbn=9781136678028|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sFmmCEe8VicC&pg=PA421|accessdate=February 20, 2018}}</ref> Many Asian Americans felt insulted by the ''Times''<nowiki>'</nowiki> actions, because [[Michelle Kwan]] is also American.<ref name="TimesKwanApology">{{cite news|last1=Fancher|first1=Mike|title=Times won't forget readers' reminder on Kwan headline|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=20020303&slug=fancher03|accessdate=February 20, 2018|work=The Seattle Times|date=March 3, 2002}}</ref> Asian American community leaders criticized the subheadline as perpetuating a stereotype that people of color can never be truly American.<ref name="TimesKwanApology"/>

The incident echoed a similar incident that happened with an [[MSNBC]] article during the [[1998 Winter Olympics|Winter games]] in 1998,<ref name="TimesKwanApology"/> which was reported on by ''Times''.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Sorensen|first1=Eric|title=Asian Groups Attack Msnbc Headline Referring To Kwan – News Web Site Apologizes For Controversial Wording|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19980303&slug=2737594|accessdate=February 20, 2018|work=The Seattle Times|date=March 3, 1998}}</ref>

The newspaper's Executive Editor at the time of the controversy, [[Mike Fancher]], issued an apology in the aftermath of the controversial headline.<ref name="TimesKwanApology"/>

===Election controversy===
On October 17, 2012, the publishers of ''The Seattle Times'' launched advertising campaigns in support of [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Washington gubernatorial election, 2012|gubernatorial candidate]] [[Rob McKenna]] and a [[Washington Referendum 74 (2012)|state referendum]] to legalize [[same-sex marriage]]. The newspaper's management said the ads were aimed at "demonstrating how effective advertising with ''The Times'' can be."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://blogs.seattletimes.com/politicsnorthwest/2012/10/17/seattle-times-co-sponsors-full-page-newspaper-ad-for-rob-mckenna/|title=Seattle Times Co. launches ad campaigns for McKenna and gay marriage, draws criticism  |date=October 17, 2012 |first=Jim|last=Brunner |work=The Seattle Times}}</ref> The advertisements in favor of McKenna represent an [[USD|$]]80,000 independent expenditure, making the newspaper the third largest contributor to his campaign.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://blogs.seattletimes.com/uwelectioneye/2012/10/22/seattle-times-ad-buy-leads-to-newsroom-reader-protests/ |title=Seattle Times Ad Buy Leads To Newsroom, Reader Protests  |date=October 22, 2012 |work=The Seattle Times |first=Kathy|last=Gill}}</ref> More than 100 staffers signed a letter of protest sent to ''Seattle Times'' Publisher Frank Blethen, calling it an "unprecedented act".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://blogs.seattletimes.com/politicsnorthwest/2012/10/18/seattle-times-news-staffers-protest-companys-political-ad-campaign/ |title=Seattle Times news staffers protest company's political-ad campaign |date=October 18, 2012 |work=The Seattle Times |first=Jim|last=Brunner}}</ref>

==The Joint Operating Agreement==
[[Image:Seattle Daily Times news editor quarters - 1900.jpg|thumb|"Quarters of the news editor", one in a group of four photos in the brochure ''Seattle and the Orient'' (1900), collectively captioned "The ''Seattle Daily Times''—Editorial Department"]]
From 1983 to 2009, the ''Times'' and Seattle's other major paper, the [[Hearst Corporation|Hearst]]-owned ''Seattle Post-Intelligencer'', were run under a "[[Joint Operating Agreement]]" (JOA) whereby advertising, production, marketing, and circulation were controlled by the ''Times'' for both papers.<ref name="overview" /> The two papers maintained their own identities with separate news and editorial departments.

The ''Times'' announced its intention to cancel the JOA in 2003, citing a [[clause]] in the JOA contract that three consecutive years of losses allowed it to pull out of the agreement.<ref>{{cite news |first=Dan |last=Richman |author2=Phuong Lee  |title=JOA fight between P-I, Times may heat up |url=http://www.seattlepi.com/business/257031_joa26.html |work=Seattle Post-Intelligencer |date=January 26, 2006}}</ref> Hearst sued, arguing that a ''[[force majeure]] clause'' prevented the ''Times'' from claiming losses as reason to end the JOA when they result from extraordinary events (in this case, a seven-week strike by members of the Newspaper Guild). While a district judge ruled in Hearst's favor, the ''Times'' won on appeal, including a unanimous decision from the [[state supreme court|Washington State Supreme Court]] on June 30, 2005.<ref>[http://www.seattlepi.com/business/230740_joa30ww.html "The ''Seattle Post-Intelligencer'', Court sides with ''Seattle Times'' in JOA dispute"]</ref> Hearst continued to argue that the ''Times'' fabricated its loss in 2002. The two papers announced an end to their dispute on April 16, 2007.<ref>{{cite news

The JOA was terminated when the ''Post-Intelligencer'' ceased publication; its final printed edition was March 17, 2009.<ref name="PI-2009"/>

==Delivery and page width==

For decades, the [[broadsheet]] page width of the ''Times'' was {{convert|13+1/2|in|cm}}, printed from a 54-inch web, the four-page width of a roll of [[newsprint]]. Following changing industry standards, the width of the page was reduced in 2005 by {{convert|1|in|cm}}, to {{convert|12+1/2|in|cm}}, now a 50-inch web standard. In February 2009, the web size was further reduced to 46&nbsp;inches, which narrowed the page by another inch to {{convert|11+1/2|in|cm}} in width.<ref>[https://archive.is/20070702190453/http://www.newsandtech.com/issues/2008/February/nt/02-08_seattle-newsize.htm "Seattle Times making move to 46-inch web"].
