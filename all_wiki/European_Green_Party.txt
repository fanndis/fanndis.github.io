The '''European Green Party''' ('''EGP'''), sometimes referred to as '''European Greens''', is the [[European political party]] that operates as a federation of political parties across Europe supporting [[green politics]]. The EGP cooperates with the [[European Free Alliance]] (EFA), [[European Pirate Party]] and [[Volt Europa]] to form the [[Greens–European Free Alliance]] (Greens/EFA) [[Political groups of the European Parliament|parliamentary group]] in the [[European parliament]].

== History ==
The European Green Party was founded on 22 February 2004 at the Fourth Congress of the European Federation of Green Parties (EFGP) in Rome attended by over 1,000 delegates. Thirty-four Green parties from all over Europe have joined this new pan-European party. The Greens were the first to form a political party at European level. The other European political federations followed suit in the period 2004–06. For the Greens this was the culmination of a process which had started with the formation of a loose co-ordination 1979–93 and the EFGP 1993–2004.<ref>[http://europeangreens.eu/content/history history of the European Green Party] at EuropeanGreens.eu</ref>

[[File:Daniel Brélaz (1982) by Erling Mandelmann.jpg|thumb|left|100px|In 1979, [[Daniel Brélaz]] became the world first [[Green party|green]] member of a national parliament ([[Switzerland]]).]]
In 1979 the '''Coordination of European Green and Radical Parties''' (CEGRP) was set up to co-ordinate the participation of Green and Radical parties in the [[1979 European Parliament election]]: There were considerable differences between the Green and Radical groups and the parties were unable to form a common pan-European electoral platform.<ref name="Bomberg2005">{{cite book|author=Elizabeth Bomberg|title=Green Parties and Politics in the European Union|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A7WIAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA70|date=2 August 2005|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-85145-4|page=70}}</ref> Although some parties polled well, no Green entered the European Parliament.

In the [[1984 European Parliament election|1984 election]] the Greens participated again. They held a congress in the spring of 1984 in [[Liège (city)|Liège]] and set up a restructured '''European Green Coordination''' (EGC), with a secretariat provided by the Dutch [[Political Party of Radicals]]. They also issued a ''Joint Declaration of the European Green Parties''. Furthermore, overall the member parties had grown stronger. Eleven [[Member of the European Parliament|MEPs]] of member parties were elected to the [[European Parliament]].{{efn|7 for the [[Alliance '90/The Greens|German Greens]], 1 for the Dutch [[Political Party of Radicals]], 1 for the Dutch [[Pacifist Socialist Party]], an ally of the PPR, 1 for [[Ecolo]] and 1 for [[Groen (political party)|Agalev]]}} They formed the '''Green Alternative European Link''' (GRAEL) in the European Parliament. The group was too small to be recognised by the Parliament for funds and committees and therefore it joined the [[Rainbow Group (1984–89)|Rainbow Group]], which also encompassed regionalists, the Danish [[People's Movement against the European Community]] and some radicals and socialists.

The European Greens formed a loose confederal triangular structure with the autonomous GRAEL in parliament, the weak EGC as a supra-national co-ordinating body and the member parties. The position of the European Greens was also weakened by the principle of rotation which some member parties (Germany and the Netherlands) used, with their MEPs being replaced by another after serving half their term. This rotation technique originated with the German Greens to prevent their members being co-opted by the informal negotiation system within the [[Bundestag]],<ref name="Hines2003">{{cite web|last=Hines |first=Eric |title=The European Parliament and the Europeanization of Green Parties |publisher=[[University of Iowa]] |year=2003 |url=http://myweb.uiowa.edu/ehhines/culturaldyamicshines.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=1 March 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080528194305/http://myweb.uiowa.edu/ehhines/culturaldyamicshines.pdf |archivedate=28 May 2008 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> but it served them badly within the European Parliament.

For the Dutch parties, the choice for rotation was a compromise between three parties which had only two seats in parliament: one seat was kept by the [[lijsttrekker|top candidate]] while the second seat rotated between the second and the third candidate. This way each party would have a representative in the EP. Finally, there still was considerable diversity in the opinions of the Greens, especially between [[pro-European]] and [[Eurosceptic]] tendencies. These factors weakened the position of the Greens in Parliament.

In the [[1989 European Parliament election|1989 election]] the Green parties won 26 seats.{{efn|7 for the [[Alliance '90/The Greens|German Greens]], 8 for [[The Greens (France)|French Greens]], 2 for the Dutch [[GreenLeft]], 2 for [[Ecolo]] and 1 for [[Groen!|Agalev]], 1 for the Spanish IP, 2 for the Italian [[Rainbow Greens]] and 2 for the Italian [[Federation of Green Lists|Green Lists]]}} Because of political conflicts with the continuing [[Rainbow Group (1989–94)|Rainbow Group]], the European Greens formed a separate parliamentary group, [[The Green Group in the European Parliament]]. During this period, the Greens became more entrenched in parliament.

In June 1993 the '''European Federation of Green Parties''' was formed by the members of the EGC in [[Kirkkonummi]], Finland. The organisation became more structured, it now had a triennial Congress, a Council and a Federation Committee (executive). It strengthened its ties with the Green Group in the European parliament.

In the [[1994 European Parliament election|1994 European elections]] Green parties won a total of 20 seats.{{efn|12 for the [[Alliance '90/The Greens|German Greens]], 1 for the Dutch [[GreenLeft]], 1 for [[Ecolo]] and 1 for [[Groen!|Agalev]], 1 for the Luxembourgish [[The Greens (Luxembourg)|The Greens]] IP, 2 for the Italian [[Federation of the Greens]] and 2 for the [[Green Party (Ireland)|Green Party]]}} They were joined by a member of the Danish [[Socialist People's Party (Denmark)|Socialist People's Party]] and one member of both the Italian [[South Tyrolean People's Party]] and [[The Network (political party)|The Network]]. Again the Greens formed a separate group from Rainbow Group, now renamed the [[European Radical Alliance]].

In the [[1999 European Parliament election|1999 European elections]] the European Greens performed particularly well winning 38 seats.{{efn|7 for the German [[Alliance '90/The Greens]], 4 for the Dutch [[GreenLeft]], 3 for [[Ecolo]] and 2 for [[Groen!|Agalev]], 1 for the Luxembourgish [[The Greens (Luxembourg)|The Greens]], 2 for the Italian [[Federation of the Greens]], 2 for the [[Green Party (Ireland)|Green Party]], 9 for [[The Greens (France)|The Greens]] of France, 2 for the [[The Greens – The Green Alternative|Austrian Greens]], 2 for the Finnish [[Green League]], 2 for the Swedish [[Green Party (Sweden)|Green Party]] and 2 for the [[Green Party of England and Wales]]}} They formed a combined group with the [[European Free Alliance]], which represented regionalist parties and independence movements, which previously participated in the European Radical Alliance. The relationship between the Greens and these parties was different from before, as the Greens were stronger both numerically and politically.

The '''European Green Party''' was founded at the Fourth Congress of the European Federation of Green Parties on 20–22 February 2004 in Rome, a party convention with over 1,000 delegates. Thirty-two Green parties from all over Europe joined this new pan-European party. The foundation of the new party was finalised with the signing of the treaty constituting the party in the Capitol of Rome. As such the Greens were the first to form a [[European political party|political party at European level]], the other European federations followed suit between 2004 and 2006.

In the [[2004 European Parliament election]] the member parties won 35 Seats. In the [[2009 European Parliament election]], even though the European Parliament was reduced in size, the EGP member parties won 46 seats, the best result of the Green Parties in 30 years.

In the [[2014 European Parliament election]] the green candidates were [[José Bové]] and [[Ska Keller]]. The campaign was at a European level, Ska Keller participating in broadcast debates with the other candidates for the [[European Commission]] presidency.

After the economic crisis, the green parties have consolidated its presence in the local and regional level. Green mayors as [[Éric Piolle]] in [[Grenoble]] or [[Fritz Kuhn]] in [[Stuttgart]] are good examples. [[Femke Halsema]] became the second green mayor of a European capital city, [[Amsterdam]], after [[Francesco Rutelli]] (Rome). At the regional level, [[Winfried Kretschmann]] became [[List of Ministers-President of Baden-Württemberg|President of Baden-Württemberg]].

[[Inés Sabanés]] and [[Célia Blauel]] are respectively members of the local governments of [[Madrid]] and Paris, being both responsible of the environment portfolio.

[[Alexander Van der Bellen]] became the first green head of state in the world, representing [[Austria]].

The candidates for the [[2019 European Parliament election]], are [[Ska Keller]] and [[Bas Eickhout]].

In the year 2020 the European Greens achieves big gains in local elections throughout Europe, being elected green mayors in [[Lyon]], [[Strasbourg]], [[Besançon]], [[Marseille]] or  [[Bourdeaux]] among others in France and in capital city [[Dublin]] in [[Ireland]] as well as [[Aachen]], [[Cologne]] or [[Bonn]] in [[Germany]].

Also green parties presence in national governments are the highest in history, being junior coalition parties in the governments of [[Sweden]], [[Austria]], [[Finland]], [[Luxembourg]], [[Belgium]], [[Republic of Ireland]], [[North Macedonia]] and [[Montenegro]].

The European Greens have always been committed to basic tenets of [[Green politics]], such as [[environmental responsibility]], [[Freedom (political)|individual freedom]], [[inclusive democracy]], [[Multiculturalism|diversity]], [[social justice]], [[gender equality]], global [[sustainable development]] and [[non-violence]].<ref>{{cite web |url = https://europeangreens.eu/node/5745 |title = Charter of the European Greens|url-status = live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070204142357/http://www.europeangreens.org/cms/default/rubrik/9/9341.the_charter_of_the_european_greens.htm |archivedate=4 February 2007|date = 13–14 October 2006|website = europeangreens.eu }}</ref>

However, its relationship to the [[European Union]] and its institutions has changed dramatically and is still the subject of a lively debate. In the 1970s and 1980s the European Greens were generally sceptical of European political and economic integration, which was seen as contrary to environmental and social interests. In its 1984 program, the European Greens advocated the formation of an alternative Europe, which would be neutral and decentralised. In 1989, some member parties adopted a more parliamentary course and became more supportive of European integration. The program advocates the democratisation of Europe's institutions. In their 1994 program, the Greens abandoned their principled opposition of European integration and began to propose pragmatic alternatives for the European Union's policies and institutions. The 1999 and 2004 programs also reflect this.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

In the area of Internet politics, the [[Greens–European Free Alliance]] (Greens/EFA) parliamentary group became famous for the strong support of a proposed [[Free Information Infrastructure]], especially in their work [[Directive on the patentability of computer-implemented inventions|on the directive against software patents]] in 2003.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

Nowadays the majority of the party is [[Federal Europe|European federalist]]. Its former leader, [[Daniel Cohn-Bendit]], is a member of the federalist [[The Spinelli Group]], and has written with [[Guy Verhofstadt]] a book with a federalist manifesto purpose. The European Green Party affiliated to the [[European Movement International]] in February 2014.<ref name="euobserver.com">{{cite web|url=http://euobserver.com/tickers/123265|title=Greens join pro-European parties' network|accessdate=26 August 2015}}</ref>

Other prominent green members of [[The Spinelli Group]] are [[Monica Frassoni]], [[Isabelle Durant]] and [[Joschka Fischer]], a former [[Vice-Chancellor of Germany]] and [[Minister for Foreign Affairs (Germany)]].

The European Green Party is an [[association without lucrative purpose|international association without lucrative purpose]] constituted out of political parties from European countries (although not necessarily from European Union member states). Parties can also become associate member. Members of the [[Green Group in the European Parliament|Green Group]] not belonging to a member party can be admitted as a special member with speaking rights but no vote.

The governing bodies of the EGP are the Council and the Committee.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://europeangreens.eu/sites/europeangreens.eu/files/EGP%20Statutes%20as%20adopted%20in%20Antwerp%20Council%20track%20changes%20accepted.pdf|title = Statutes of the European Green Party|website = europeangreens.eu|date = 20 May 2018|access-date = 24 January 2019|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20190125020522/https://europeangreens.eu/sites/europeangreens.eu/files/EGP%20Statutes%20as%20adopted%20in%20Antwerp%20Council%20track%20changes%20accepted.pdf|archive-date = 25 January 2019|url-status = dead}}</ref> 
*The ''Council'' consists of delegates of member parties. These are allotted on the basis of their most recent European or national election results. Each party has at least two delegates. The council is responsible for political affairs between congresses and it decides over organizational matters, such as the election of committee, the application of members and observers and the statutes of the EGP.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://europeangreens.eu/learn-about-egp|title=Learn about the EGP|website=europeangreens.eu}}</ref>
*The ''Committee'' consists of nine members, including two spokespersons (one man and one woman), a secretary-general and a treasurer. They are responsible for daily political affairs, execution of the council's decisions and the activities of the EGP office and staff.
*The ''Congress'' is an enlarged meeting of the Council which is convened by the Council at least once every 5 years.

The European Greens are organised in several regional networks. These are organised around seas, creating somewhat of a [[bioregional democracy|bioregional structure]]: such as the Green Islands Network ("''a network for Green Parties in Britain, Ireland and associated islands''"), the Baltic Sea Greens, the Green Mediterranean Network, Green Adriatic Network and the North Sea Greens.

''[[The Greens (Denmark)|De Grønne]]'' from Denmark were expelled from the EGP in 2008. The reason was that ''De Grønne'' intended to co-operate with the [[People's Movement against the EU]] in the upcoming [[2009 European Parliament election in Denmark|2009 European elections]], a national party which sits with the [[European United Left–Nordic Green Left]] parliamentary group instead of the [[Greens–European Free Alliance]]. The party was disbanded in 2014.

On 13 May 2012, the Council of the EGP withdrew the membership of [[Confederation of the Greens]] (''Los Verdes'') from Spain,<ref>[http://europeangreens.eu/news/%E2%80%9Cconfederaci%C3%B3n-de-los-verdes%E2%80%9D-no-longer-part-european-green-family "Confederación de Los Verdes" no longer part of the European Green family] (retrieved on 13 May 2012)</ref> after several months of negotiations, and mainly because 13 out of 16 parties (formerly within the Confederation of the Greens) decided to join EQUO.

The [[Green Left (Hungary)|Green Left]] from Hungary withdrew its membership on 7 September 2015 because of financial reasons. They disbanded in 2018.

On 10 November 2019, the [[Latvian Green Party]] was expelled from the EGP, due to its nationalist, anti-LGBT and anti-immigration views.<ref>{{cite news |title=Latvian Green Party expelled from European Green Party |url=https://eng.lsm.lv/article/politics/politics/latvian-green-party-expelled-from-european-green-party.a337974/ |accessdate=17 March 2020 |work=eng.lsm.lv |language=en}}</ref>
