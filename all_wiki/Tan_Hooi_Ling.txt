===Eli Lilly===
While studying at the University of Bath, Tan took a year off school to do an industrial placement at [[Eli Lilly and Company|Eli Lilly]] in [[Basingstoke]].

===McKinsey===
Despite not knowing what the company did, Tan signed up for an event held by [[Management consulting|consulting firm]] McKinsey & Company in [[Malaysia]], eventually landing a job with the company where she performed well enough that they sponsored her MBA education at Harvard Business School - where she met fellow Malaysian and future co-founder of Grab, Anthony Tan, in the class of 2011.<ref>Ambler, P.

===Grab===
While at Harvard Business School, Tan worked on a [[business plan]] with HBS classmate, [[Anthony Tan]], for a "mobile app that connects taxi seekers directly with taxi drivers closest to their location in the chaotic Malaysian urban environment", which would later become GrabTaxi. The inspiration came from a comment by Anthony's friend about the safety issues facing female taxi passengers in Malaysia.{{cn|date=November 2019}}

The pair's business plan was the runner-up in the HBS New Venture Competition in 2011, winning $25,000. Using the proceeds from the competition and their own personal funds, Tan Hooi Ling and Anthony Tan launched the [[Mobile app|mobile application]], first called MyTeksi, in June 2012.<ref>President & Fellows of Harvard College.

Although the pair had started the company, Tan had to return to McKinsey after graduation to serve out her bond with the consulting firm as a condition of sponsoring her education. She later moved on to San Francisco-based software company [[Salesforce.com|Salesforce]], while taking time out of her schedule at the company to help out Anthony with Grab in [[Southeast Asia]]. She returned to work full-time on Grab in 2015.<ref>Tan, S. (2018, March 26). Lunch With Sumiko: Grab whiz Tan Hooi Ling happy to stay low-key.
