'''WCAU''', [[virtual channel]] 10 ([[ultra high frequency|UHF]] [[digital terrestrial television|digital]] channel 28), is an [[NBC]] [[owned and operated station|owned-and-operated]] [[television station]] [[city of license|licensed]] to [[Philadelphia|Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], United States. The station is owned by the [[NBC Owned Television Stations]] subsidiary of [[NBCUniversal]], as part of a [[duopoly (broadcasting)|duopoly]] with [[Mount Laurel, New Jersey]]-licensed [[Telemundo]] owned-and-operated station [[WWSI]] (channel 62); NBCUniversal, a subsidiary of locally based media firm [[Comcast]], owns both networks, along with [[regional sports network]] [[NBC Sports Philadelphia]]. WCAU and WWSI share studios within the [[Comcast Technology Center]] on [[Arch Street (Philadelphia)|Arch Street]] in [[Center City, Philadelphia|Center City]], with some operations remaining at their former main studio at the corner of [[City Avenue]] and Monument Road in [[Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania|Bala Cynwyd]], along the [[Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]]–[[Montgomery County, Pennsylvania|Montgomery]] county line. The two stations also share transmitter facilities in the [[Roxborough, Philadelphia|Roxborough]] section of Philadelphia.

==History==
===As a CBS station (1946–1995)===
In 1946, the ''[[Philadelphia Bulletin|Philadelphia Evening Bulletin]]'' secured a [[construction permit]] for channel 10,<ref>[http://www.americanradiohistory.com/hd2/Archive-BC-IDX/46-OCR/1946-10-07-BC-OCR-Page-0039.pdf "Commercial video stations total 38."] ''[[Broadcasting and Cable|Broadcasting – Telecasting]]''. October 7, 1946, pg. 39.</ref> naming its proposed station WPEN-TV after the newspaper's WPEN radio stations (950 AM, now [[WKDN (AM)|WKDN]], and 98.1 FM, later WCAU-FM and now [[WOGL]]). The picture changed dramatically in 1947, when ''[[The Philadelphia Record]]'' folded. The ''Bulletin'' inherited the ''Record''{{'}}s "[[Goodwill (accounting)|goodwill]]", along with the rights to buy the radio station WCAU (1210 AM, now [[WPHT]]) and the original WCAU-FM (102.9 FM) from their longtime owners, brothers Isaac and Leon Levy. The ''Bulletin'' sold the less-powerful WPEN and WCAU-FM, with the latter being renamed WPEN-FM (it is now [[WMGK]]). The ''Bulletin'' kept its FM station, renaming it WCAU-FM to match its new AM sister. The newspaper also kept its construction permit for channel 10, renaming it '''WCAU-TV'''.

WCAU-TV went on the air March 1, 1948 as Philadelphia's third television station with an initial test pattern on Channel 10. It carried its first CBS network show on a "sneak preview" basis on March 3,<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://americanradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Magazines/Archive-BC-IDX/48-OCR/1948-03-08-BC-OCR-Page-0094.pdf|title=WCAU-TV STARTS|page=88|last=Brandschain|first=Herman|work=Broadcasting|date=March 8, 1948|access-date=December 3, 2019}}</ref>  but the official opening of the station wasn't until May 23, 1948.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.broadcastpioneers.com/5-23-48.html | title=The Broadcast Pioneers of Philadelphia}}</ref> It secured an affiliation with [[CBS]] through the influence of the Levy brothers, who continued to work for the newspaper as consultants. WCAU radio had been one of CBS' original 16 affiliates when the network launched in 1927. A year later, the Levy brothers persuaded their brother-in-law, [[William S. Paley]], to buy the struggling network. The Levy brothers were shareholders and directors at CBS for many years. Due to this long relationship, channel 10 signed on as CBS's third television affiliate.

[[File:WTP D03 AMP 1.jpg|155px|thumb|right|Original studio at 1622 Chestnut Street.]]
In the late 1950s, the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) collapsed northern [[Delaware]], southern New Jersey and the [[Lehigh Valley]] into the Philadelphia market. The ''Bulletin'' realized that channel 10's original tower, atop the [[PSFS Building]] in Center City, was not nearly strong enough to serve this larger viewing area. In 1957, WCAU-TV moved to a new {{convert|1200|ft|m|0|adj=on}} tower in Roxborough, which added most of Delaware, the [[Jersey Shore]] and the Lehigh Valley to its city-grade coverage.

[[File:Wcau70s.jpg|thumb|right|165px|WCAU-TV ident from 1973 to 1976. The "10" survived with only minor changes until 1995.]]
Also in 1957, the ''Bulletin'' formed a limited partnership with the Megargee family, owner of CBS affiliate WGBI-TV (channel 22) in [[Scranton, Pennsylvania|Scranton]]. As part of the deal, channel 22's call letters were changed to WDAU-TV (WDAU's call letters were changed again to [[WYOU]] in 1986). Soon afterward, the FCC ruled that the ''Bulletin'' could not keep both stations due to a large signal overlap in the Lehigh Valley. Although the ''Bulletin'' had only bought a minority stake in channel 22, the FCC ruled that this stake was so large that the two stations were effectively a [[Duopoly (broadcasting)|duopoly]]. The ''Bulletin'' could not afford to get a waiver to keep both stations, so it opted to keep its stake in WDAU-TV and sell the WCAU stations to CBS. CBS had to seek a waiver to buy the WCAU stations, as the signals of WCAU's AM and television stations overlapped with those of [[WCBS (AM)|WCBS radio]] and [[WCBS-TV]] in [[New York City]] (in the case of the AM outlets, both were [[clear-channel stations]]; the FCC at the time usually did not allow common ownership of clear-channel stations with overlapping nighttime coverage areas). However, in its application for a waiver, CBS cited NBC's then-ownership of WRCV-TV in Philadelphia (channel 3, now [[KYW-TV]]) and WRCA-TV in New York City (now [[WNBC]]). The FCC readily granted the waiver, and CBS took control in 1958.

===Switch from CBS to NBC (1994–1995)===
{{further|1994–1996 United States broadcast TV realignment}}
[[File: WCAU-TV logo.png|180px|thumb|right|WCAU's "boxed 10" logo was adopted upon its new affiliation with NBC in September 1995, and its use lasted until February 2012. Former O&O [[WJAR]] in [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]], [[Rhode Island]] also adopted the logo following its purchase by NBC.]]
In July 1994, CBS entered into a long-term affiliation agreement with [[Westinghouse Broadcasting|Westinghouse (Group W) Broadcasting]], owners of Philadelphia's longtime NBC affiliate, KYW-TV, and its sister stations in [[Baltimore]] ([[WJZ-TV]]) and [[Boston]] ([[WBZ-TV]]); this deal was triggered by an affiliation deal between ABC and [[E. W. Scripps Company|Scripps]] that renewed the network's affiliation with its stations in [[WEWS-TV|Cleveland]] and [[WXYZ-TV|Detroit]] and caused [[WMAR-TV]] and [[WFTS-TV|two]] [[KNXV-TV|other]] stations to switch to that network. Westinghouse converted all three of those stations into CBS affiliates. CBS was reluctant to include KYW-TV in the deal since it had been a very distant third in the Philadelphia ratings for more than a decade. In contrast, WCAU was a solid runner-up to [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]-owned station [[WPVI-TV]] (channel 6). Ultimately, CBS decided to affiliate with channel 3 and sell channel 10, ending a 47-year relationship (including 37 years of ownership) with the station.

NBC and [[New World Pictures#New World Communications (1992–1997)|New World Communications]] then emerged as the leading bidders for WCAU.<ref>{{cite news|title=CBS, FOX may swap stations, paper says|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=RM&p_theme=rm&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EB4DEA31EBE1729&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM|access-date=April 2, 2013|newspaper=[[Rocky Mountain News]]|date=July 26, 1994}}{{closed access}}</ref> NBC had wanted to own a station in Philadelphia for many years; for most of the broadcasting era, Philadelphia was the largest market where NBC didn't own a station. It briefly succeeded in 1956, when it [[extortion|extorted]] Westinghouse into exchanging channel 3 (then called WPTZ-TV) and KYW radio for NBC's [[Cleveland]] stations, [[WTAM|WTAM-AM]]-[[WMJI|FM]] and [[WKYC-TV|WNBK television]]. However, after Westinghouse complained, the FCC and the [[United States Department of Justice|U.S. Justice Department]] nullified the swap in June 1965. New World got into the bidding because it had just signed a multi-year affiliation deal with [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]], and intended to make WCAU a Fox station had it emerged victoriously. Fox's affiliate in Philadelphia, [[WTXF-TV]], was about to become an affiliate of the United Paramount Network ([[UPN]]), which was to be programmed mostly by WTXF's owner, [[Paramount Stations Group]]. New World found the chance to give Fox a VHF station in the nation's fourth-largest market too much to resist. Fox jumped into the bidding as well in case New World's bid fell through.

However, [[Viacom (1971–2005)|Viacom]], which bought Paramount in mid-1994, opted instead to sell WTXF-TV to Fox, making WTXF-TV a Fox O&O. New World pulled out of the bidding war for WCAU as well, effectively handing channel 10 to NBC. Had WCAU become a Fox station, it would have retained its status as the "home" station of the [[National Football League|NFL]]'s [[Philadelphia Eagles]]. The station had carried Eagles games since 1950, and had carried the majority of Eagles games since [[NFL on CBS|CBS]] won the rights to NFL games in 1956. Indeed, Fox had cut its affiliation deal with New World because it had recently [[NFL on Fox|won the rights]] to the [[National Football Conference]], where the Eagles play, and most games were thus moved to WTXF; New World owned a large number of CBS affiliates.

===As an NBC-owned station (1995–present)===
While KYW-TV's sister stations in Boston and Baltimore switched to CBS in January 1995, the swap was delayed in Philadelphia when CBS discovered that an outright sale of channel 10 would have forced it to pay taxes on the proceeds from the deal.<ref>{{cite web|title=From the official archives of the Broadcast Pioneers of Philadelphia |url=http://www.broadcastpioneers.com/kenmatz.html|access-date=September 2, 2012}}{{Clarify|reason=ambiguous date format|date=April 2016}}</ref> To solve this problem, CBS, NBC and Group W entered into a complex ownership and affiliation deal in November 1994. To make the deal for WCAU an even trade, NBC transferred [[KCNC-TV]] in [[Denver]] and [[KUTV]] in [[Salt Lake City]] (a station that NBC had only acquired earlier that year) to CBS in exchange; additionally, the [[WTVJ|NBC]] and [[WFOR-TV|CBS]] stations in [[Miami]] traded broadcasting facilities, with CBS moving to the stronger of the two signals. CBS then traded controlling interest in KCNC and KUTV to Group W in return for a minority stake in KYW-TV. The deal officially took effect on September 10, 1995. Group W's parent, the [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse Electric Corporation]], purchased CBS two months later, making CBS's Philadelphia radio stations sisters to WCAU-AM/WPHT's longtime rival, KYW radio.

Although the radio stations had dropped the WCAU calls some years before, NBC dropped the ''-TV'' suffix from channel 10's callsign soon after it assumed control.

In January 2011, the Philadelphia-based cable and media company [[Comcast]] acquired a 51% majority stake in WCAU's parent company, by then known as NBC Universal, which effectively makes the station locally owned.<ref>[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703293204576105392747186936 Vivendi Wraps Up Sale of NBC Universal Stake], ''Wall Street Journal'', January 27, 2011</ref> Comcast bought the other 49% in early 2013.

In March 2013, NBCUniversal announced that it would buy [[Telemundo]] affiliate [[WWSI]] from [[ZGS Communications]] for $20 million, giving WCAU a [[duopoly (broadcasting)|duopoly]] partner, as with several other NBC O&Os.<ref>{{cite news|title=NBCUniversal doubles in Philadelphia with Telemundo outlet|url=http://rbr.com/nbcuniversal-doubles-in-philadelphia-with-telemundo-outlet/|access-date=July 2, 2013|newspaper=Radio & Television Business Report|date=March 21, 2013}}</ref> The sale was completed on June 2 of that year.<ref>{{cite news|title=Telemundo closes on purchase of WWSI; The addition of the full-power station in Philadelphia gives NBCU's Hispanic group 16 stations.|url=http://www.tvnewscheck.com/article/68674/telemundo-closes-on-purchase-of-wwsi|access-date=July 2, 2013|newspaper=TVNewsCheck|date=July 2, 2013}}</ref>

On February 14, 2014, WCAU along with nearby NBC affiliate [[WBAL-TV]] in [[Baltimore]] began to be shown on Comcast Cable systems in the [[Susquehanna River|Susquehanna Valley]] after [[WGAL]], the NBC affiliate in that market, was knocked off the air after a portion of the roof at the station's Columbia Avenue studio facility collapsed due to heavy accumulations of snow and ice caused by a [[February 2014 North American winter storm|winter storm that moved through the Eastern United States]] earlier that week.<ref>[http://lancasteronline.com/lancaster/news/snow-and-ice-collapses-roof-at-wgal/article_fcf12404-95b9-11e3-aba7-0017a43b2370.html Snow and ice collapses roof at WGAL], ''LancasterOnline'', February 14, 2014.</ref><ref>[http://lancasteronline.com/lancaster/news/snow-on-roof-forces-evacuation-at-wgal/article_fcf12404-95b9-11e3-aba7-0017a43b2370.html Snow and ice collapses roof at WGAL, knocks local station off the air], ''LancasterOnline'', February 14, 2014.</ref><ref>[http://www.wgal.com/news/susquehanna-valley/lancaster/roof-collapses-at-wgals-lancaster-studio/24491112 Roof collapses at WGAL's Lancaster studio], WGAL, February 14, 2014.</ref><ref name=tpn-wgalroofwbalcomcast>{{cite news|last=Arias|first=Jeremy|title=Comcast to substitute WGAL Lancaster with Baltimore affiliate following roof collapse|url=http://www.pennlive.com/midstate/index.ssf/2014/02/comcast_to_substitute_wgal_lan.html|access-date=February 15, 2014|newspaper=[[The Patriot-News]]|date=February 14, 2014}}</ref>

On April 16, 2014, [[WMGM-TV]] (channel 40), the NBC affiliate in nearby [[Atlantic City, New Jersey|Atlantic City]], announced that the station would drop its NBC affiliation and shut down its news operation on [[New Year's Day|January 1]], 2015, presumably due to WCAU claiming market exclusivity (Atlantic City is part of the Philadelphia market). Following an hour-long documentary focusing on the station's history and staff entitled ''NewsCenter 40: The Stories Behind the Station'', WMGM-TV then began carrying programs from the [[Soul of the South]] network, while WCAU became the sole NBC affiliate in the market. WMGM-TV was sold to [[Univision Communications]] in 2017 and is now a primary [[True Crime Network]] affiliate; it also relays sister station and [[Univision]] network O&O [[WUVP-DT]] (channel 65) on its third digital subchannel.

Channel 10 was originally located at 1622 Chestnut Street in [[Center City Philadelphia|Center City]] along with its sister radio stations (the building, which was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1983, now houses The Art Institute). In 1952, WCAU-AM-FM-TV moved to a new facility in the [[Pennsylvania Main Line|Main Line]] suburb of Bala Cynwyd, just north of the Philadelphia–Montgomery County line. The studio, located on Monument Road at City Avenue, was a state-of-the-art television center, and the first building in America constructed specifically for mainly television productions (though the WCAU radio stations were also based out of the facility until the 1995 sale to NBC).

On January 16, 2014, it was announced that WCAU and sister station WWSI would move to the under-construction [[Comcast Technology Center]] on Arch Street in Center City, which was built by NBC parent Comcast. This 59-story building became the tallest building in Philadelphia, and is now recognized as the tallest building in the United States outside of New York and Chicago.<ref>[http://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/business/Comcast-Seeks-to-Redefine-Philadelphia-Itself-240313291.html WCAU-TV webpage about new Comcast building] Retrieved January 17, 2014</ref> After several weeks of off-air tests, WCAU and WWSI officially moved all on-air operations to the new facility on October 21, 2018. However, some technical and other operations, and the base and staging for the station's live news vehicles, will remain in Bala Cynwyd for the time being.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www2.philly.com/philly/business/comcast/nbc-comcast-new-television-studios-telemundo-20181011.html|title=In Bala Cynwyd since '52, WCAU in final stages of downtown move to new Comcast Center|last=Fernandez|first=Bob|date=October 11, 2018|work=[[Philadelphia Media Network]]|access-date=October 23, 2018}}</ref>

On October 25, 2010, WCAU introduced its own version of [[WNBC]]'s [[NBC New York Nonstop|New York Nonstop]] channel, ''NBC Philadelphia Nonstop''. This subchannel featured various news and entertainment programs, and a locally produced newscast at 7 p.m. On December 20, 2012, digital subchannel 10.2 became an affiliate of [[Cozi TV]], which replaced the Nonstop network. 34.5 (virtual 62.1) carries WWSI, as described below, with 34.6/62.2 carrying [[TeleXitos]], under a channel share agreement.

WCAU also has a [[Mobile DTV]] feed of subchannel 10.1, labelled "NBC10", broadcasting at 1.83 Mbit/s.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.rabbitears.info/market.php?request=atscmph |title = RabbitEars.Info}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.mdtvsignalmap.com/ |title=Mobile DTV Signal Map from the National Association of Broadcasters |access-date=September 18, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161017031109/http://www.mdtvsignalmap.com/ |archive-date=October 17, 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

===Analog-to-digital conversion===
WCAU signed on its digital signal on December 4, 1998. The station shut down its analog signal, over [[Very high frequency|VHF]] channel 10, on June 12, 2009, the official date in which full-power television stations in the United States [[Digital television transition in the United States|transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts]] under federal mandate. The station's digital signal moved from its pre-transition [[Ultra high frequency|UHF]] channel 67 to channel 34 for post-transition digital operations, because [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] affiliate [[WHTM-TV]] in [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania]] continued broadcasting on channel 10 after ceasing channel 27 analog transmission that day.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hraunfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DA-06-1082A2.pdf |title=DTV Tentative Channel Designations for the First and the Second Rounds |access-date=March 24, 2012}}</ref><ref name="FCCForm387">[http://fjallfoss.fcc.gov/cgi-bin/ws.exe/prod/cdbs/forms/prod/cdbsmenu.hts?context=25&appn=101309596&formid=387&fac_num=63153 FCC DTV status report for WCAU]</ref> Through the use of [[Program and System Information Protocol|PSIP]], digital television receivers continue to display the station's [[virtual channel]] as its former VHF analog channel 10.1.

On April 13, 2017, it was revealed that the over-the-air spectrum of sister station WWSI has been sold in the FCC's [[spectrum reallocation]] auction, fetching $125.9 million—the highest payout from the process. As a result, WWSI's signal is now co-located with WCAU. NBC had won similar spectrum bids using the Telemundo station in Chicago (which will be in similar arrangement with NBC O&O [[WMAQ-TV]]) and the NBC station in New York (also in similar arrangement with Telemundo O&O [[WNJU]]), but stated that in this case, the NBC station had a superior signal.<ref name="tvnc-nbcspectrum">{{cite web|title=NBC Makes Over $480 Million From Auction|url=http://www.tvnewscheck.com/article/103245/nbc-makes-over-480-million-from-auction|website=TVNewsCheck|access-date=April 13, 2017|date=April 13, 2017}}</ref>

==Programming==
As of September 2019, [[Broadcast syndication|syndicated]] programming broadcast on WCAU including ''[[Access Hollywood]]'', ''[[The Kelly Clarkson Show]]'' and ''[[The Ellen DeGeneres Show]]''. WCAU is one of the nine NBC O&Os (along with [[WNBC]] in [[New York City]], [[WVIT]] in [[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]], [[KNTV]] in [[San Francisco]], [[KNBC]] in [[Los Angeles]], [[WMAQ-TV]] in [[Chicago]], [[KXAS-TV]] in [[Dallas]], [[WTVJ]] in [[Miami]], and [[KNSD]] in [[San Diego]]) that carry and distribute programming either nationally or regionally.

From 1965 to 1986, WCAU-TV was the only network-owned station in Philadelphia. As such, it was the only station in the city that did not heavily or moderately preempt network programming. Channel 10 did, however, run an hour of [[Saturday morning cartoon]]s during the 7 a.m. hour on a one-week delay in order to run the hour-long locally produced children's program, ''[[Gene London|The Gene London Show]]'', which ended in 1977. Beginning in 1978, WCAU-TV began preempting an hour of Sunday morning cartoon reruns and in the beginning of 1979 the station preempted an hour of the Saturday morning cartoons. By 1980, the station was running the entire Saturday morning cartoon lineup again and by early in 1981, the Sunday morning hour of children's programs was brought back.

===''Wawa Welcome America''===
In July 2016, Comcast announced that they would take over as presenting sponsor of the ''[[Wawa Welcome America]]'' [[Independence Day (United States)|4th of July]] festivities, particularly the Philly July 4 Jam and Grand Finale Fireworks; WCAU and WWSI assumed the local broadcast duties beginning in 2016, thus ending 32 years of broadcast rights with [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] owned-and-operated WPVI, while the Philly July 4 Jam concert was also broadcast nationally on [[VH1]]. By airing the event, the station preempts the live national NBC telecast of the ''[[Macy's]] 4th of July Fireworks'' from New York City, though it carries the condensed replay immediately after both ceremonies end.

===Sports programming===
Since Comcast acquired the station's parent NBCUniversal in 2011, WCAU has aired Philadelphia's major sports teams in many years. Because of those commitments to air these major sports teams, they reschedule NBC network programs preempted on the station. WCAU, as both a CBS and NBC station, has also aired Philadelphia's pro sports teams through their network coverage as well.

On January 2, 2014, Comcast and the [[Philadelphia Phillies]] announced a 25-year, $2.5 billion TV contract, including WCAU and Comcast SportsNet Philadelphia (now [[NBC Sports Philadelphia]]); although it averaged $100 million a year, it was structured to begin below the average and end above it. As part of its 25-year TV contract, WCAU took over free-to-air broadcast rights for Phillies baseball games from [[MyNetworkTV]] affiliate [[WPHL-TV]] beginning in the [[2014 Philadelphia Phillies season|2014 season]], including its Opening Day game and selected games aired on the station.<ref>{{cite web|last=Axisa|first=Mike|title=Phillies agree to long-term television deal with Comcast SportsNet|url=http://www.cbssports.com/mlb/eye-on-baseball/24395890/phillies-agree-to-longterm-television-deal-with-comcast-sportsnet|work=Eye on Baseball – CBSSports.com|publisher=CBS Interactive|access-date=February 9, 2014|date=January 2, 2014}}</ref> Some games may air on [[WTXF]], per the national broadcast agreement between [[Major League Baseball]] and [[Fox Major League Baseball|Fox Sports]]. As a CBS station, WCAU also aired select Phillies games as part of [[Major League Baseball on CBS|CBS' broadcast contract with Major League Baseball]] from [[1990 Philadelphia Phillies season|1990]] to [[1993 Philadelphia Phillies season|1993]], including the [[1993 World Series]], in which the Phillies lost to the [[1993 Toronto Blue Jays season|Toronto Blue Jays]].

====Philadelphia Eagles====
[[Philadelphia Eagles]] games primarily aired on Channel 10 back when it was a CBS station and that network carried the [[National Football Conference]], a relationship that began in 1956 when CBS took on the broadcast rights to the pre-merger National Football League. That arrangement lasted until [[1994 Philadelphia Eagles season|1994]], when [[Fox NFL|Fox]] acquired the NFC contract and with it, the Eagles games to [[WTXF]]. After being traded to NBC, only select games where the Eagles hosted an [[American Football Conference]] opponent would air on WCAU from [[1995 Philadelphia Eagles season|1995]] to [[1997 Philadelphia Eagles season|1997]], when [[NFL on CBS|CBS]] regained the NFL. Since [[2006 Philadelphia Eagles season|2006]], Eagles games broadcast nationally by [[NBC Sports]] have aired on WCAU, mostly ''[[NBC Sunday Night Football|Sunday Night Football]]'' contests but also [[Super Bowl LII]], which saw the Eagles clinch their first NFL championship in the modern Super Bowl era.

In the summer of 2015, Comcast and the Eagles announced a new TV contract involving the team, WCAU began airing the preseason games in the [[2015 Philadelphia Eagles season|2015 season]] after ending its contract with ABC owned-and-operated station WPVI in the [[2014 Philadelphia Eagles season|2014 season]]. Pre-season games are sub-licensed to other stations during [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] years.

====Philadelphia Flyers====
WCAU has free-to-air rights to the [[Philadelphia Flyers]] hockey games beginning with the [[2017–18 Philadelphia Flyers season|2017–18 season]] with [[NBC Sports Philadelphia]]; currently, these Flyers games are also broadcast nationally on the station through [[NHL on NBC|its broadcast package of the National Hockey League]].

====Philadelphia 76ers====
Beginning in the [[2017–18 Philadelphia 76ers season|2017–18 season]], WCAU began displaying its in-court advertisements during all of the [[Philadelphia 76ers]] [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] franchise home games held at the [[Wells Fargo Center (Philadelphia)|Wells Fargo Center]]; the home games of the 76ers are currently broadcast on its sister regional sports network NBC Sports Philadelphia. Prior to the launch of the station's in-court advertisement campaign, the station carrying these 76ers games as part of [[NBA on NBC|the network's broadcasting package of the NBA]] from 1995 until 2002, when the national 76ers games was moved to [[NBA on ABC|ABC]] (WPVI locally) and [[NBA on ESPN|ESPN]]. During its run as a CBS station, all 76ers games that were broadcast as part of [[NBA on CBS|that network's NBA broadcast contract]] from 1973 to 1990 aired on channel 10, including the team's victory in the [[1983 NBA Finals]].

====Broad Street Run====
In 2015, WCAU assumed the local English broadcast rights of the [[Broad Street Run|Blue Cross Broad Street Run]], held every first Sunday of May, taking over from ABC O&O WPVI after the 36th annual event in 2014.

==News operation==
WCAU presently broadcasts 47 hours, 55 minutes of locally produced newscasts each week (with 7 hours, 35 minutes each weekday, four hours on Saturdays and six hours on Sundays). News has been produced at WCAU from when the station went on the air on in 1948. [[Charles Shaw (journalist)|Charles Shaw]], who had worked with [[Edward R. Murrow]] as a CBS correspondent in London during World War II, was the station's news director from 1948 until he left the station in the early 1960s. [[John Facenda]], who later gained fame as the voice of [[NFL Films]], was the station's main anchorman from shortly after it signed on until 1973. At the time he retired, he had been a main anchor longer than anyone in Philadelphia; he has since been passed by WPVI's [[Jim Gardner (broadcaster)|Jim Gardner]].

Soon after joining the station, Facenda sold the ''Bulletin'' on the idea of a local 11 p.m. newscast—the first in the country. It aired for the first time on September 8. In 1950, WCAU became the first station with a four-man news team. The 6 p.m. newscast was anchored by Facenda, with Philadelphia radio legend Phil Sheridan handling weather, [[Jack Whitaker]] on sports and [[Ed McMahon]] as announcer. In 1965, channel 10 introduced the "Big News" format from [[Los Angeles]] sister station KNXT (now [[KCBS-TV]]).

The station's news operation was the ratings leader in Philadelphia for most of the time from the late 1940s until the 1960s, when it was surpassed by KYW-TV's ''[[Eyewitness News]]''. The station then remained a strong second until the 1970s, when WPVI-TV's ''[[Action News]]'' bumped channel 10 down to third place. WCAU struggled through the late 1970s while most of its CBS sister stations dominated the ratings, but has since recovered and has been a solid runner-up to longtime leader WPVI for over a quarter century. WCAU managed to pass WPVI in the 5 p.m. time slot for a time in the early 1980s with its original ''Live at 5'', anchored by Larry Kane and Deborah Knapp (now at [[KENS]] in [[San Antonio]]). In 2001, WCAU made national news when its 11 p.m. newscast (anchored by Larry Mendte and Renee Chenault-Fattah) knocked WPVI from the top spot in the local news ratings for the first time in decades. Since 2003, WCAU has had to fend off a spirited challenge from a resurgent KYW-TV for second place in the Philadelphia ratings; Channel 3's resurgence was fueled in part by luring Mendte away from channel 10.

WCAU used music based on "Channel 2 News", written by [[Dick Marx]] for [[WBBM-TV]] in [[Chicago]] (the 'de facto' official music for CBS' O&O stations) and variations on it from 1982 until the 11 p.m. newscast on September 9, 1995 hours before the switch to NBC. It used the original 1975 version from 1982 to 1987, a synthesized version produced by a local composer during the 1987–88 season and the "Palmer News Package" composed by [[Shelly Palmer#Work as a Composer|Shelly Palmer]] from 1988 to 1995. KYW-TV has used variants on this theme in recent years.

Shortly after CBS agreed to sell the station to NBC, WCAU dropped its longtime moniker of ''Channel 10 News'' in favor of ''NewsCenter 10''. After the sale closed, NBC changed the newscast name to ''News 10'', it became ''NBC 10 News'' in 2000. On December 10, 2005, WCAU took over production of [[WPHL-TV]] (channel 17)'s nightly half-hour 10 p.m. newscast after that station shuttered its in-house news department and laid off its entire news and production staff; this new newscast was called ''WB 17 News at 10, Powered by NBC 10''. On July 25, 2006, the program was renamed ''My PHL 17 News, Powered by NBC 10'' to correspond with WPHL's then-pending switch to [[MyNetworkTV]]. This newscast competed with the 10 p.m. newscasts on [[WTXF]] (channel 29, which is produced in-house) and [[WPSG]] (channel 57, which is produced by KYW-TV). On September 14, 2012 WCAU produced its final edition of WPHL's newscast. The next day WPVI officially took over production and rebranded the newscast as ''Action News at 10 on PHL 17''.

From 2001 to 2005, [[WPPX-TV]] rebroadcast some of WCAU's newscasts.

On November 13, 2008, [[Fox Television Stations]] and NBC Local Media entered into an agreement to test a system that would allow Fox-owned stations and NBC-owned stations to pool their news resources ranging from shared video to any aerial video from a helicopter. WCAU and Fox owned-and-operated station WTXF were the first stations to undertake the plan (known as a "[[Local News Service]]" agreement) as an effective way to deal with the difficulties in costs in news operations.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.philly.com//philly/business/homepage/20081114_Fox__NBC_to_pool_news_video_in_Phila__area.html |title = Fox, NBC to pool news video in Phila. Area}}</ref> WCAU later announced in September 2012, that it would be leaving the Local News Service agreement with WTXF and KYW-TV (which entered the agreement by 2010) and utilize its own helicopter. The new helicopter, dubbed "SkyForce 10", debuted on February 25, 2013.

WCAU became the fourth and last English-language television station in the Philadelphia [[media market|market]] to begin broadcasting its local news programming in [[high-definition television|high-definition]] on December 10, 2008, starting with its 4 p.m. newscast.<ref>http://www.tvpredictions.com/localhdtoday121008.htm</ref> On September 12, 2011, WCAU expanded its weekday morning newscast to 4:30&nbsp;a.m., along with the launch of a new midday newscast at 11 a.m., and the reduction of ''The 10! Show'' to a half-hour program. On December 6, 2011, the station announced a partnership with [[public broadcasting]] stations [[WHYY-FM]]-[[WHYY-TV|TV]] as part of a larger effort by [[NBCUniversal]] to partner with nonprofit news organizations following its acquisition by [[Comcast]].<ref name=lat-wcauwhyy>{{cite news|title=Quick Takes: NBC, nonprofits to team|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-quick-20111206,0,7267633.story|access-date=December 10, 2011|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=December 6, 2011}}</ref> On September 15, 2012, ''The 10! Show'' ended its run after ten years. On September 17, 2012, WCAU's midday newscast expanded to one hour.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/entertainment/celebrities_gossip/NBC10-ending-10-show-after-8-years-Last-broadcast-is-Friday.html |title = NBC10 ending '10!' show after 10 years, last broadcast is Friday}}</ref> Their morning newscast starts at 4:00am.

Former morning anchor [[Vai Sikahema]] may be the station's most recognizable current personality.  A former [[Philadelphia Eagles|Philadelphia Eagle]], Sikahema is one of several former [[National Football League|NFL]] stars who have gone on to become sports news anchors (other notable examples include [[Jim Hill (American football)|Jim Hill]] of [[KCBS-TV]] [[Los Angeles]] and [[Len Dawson]] of [[KMBC-TV]] [[Kansas City]]). While Sikahema anchors the sportscasts on WCAU-TV weeknights, on-air personalities from [[Comcast SportsNet Philadelphia]] have anchored sports on weekends in recent years, owing to Comcast owning NBC through NBCUniversal since the start of the 2010s.

In February 2014, WCAU became the second television station in Philadelphia (behind Fox O&O WTXF-TV) to expand its weekday morning newscast to three hours, with addition of a half-hour at 4:00&nbsp;a.m., but however they canceled it in 2016, and they revived it on July 31, 2017. In conjunction with this, they switched its music to the "L.A. Groove" theme that has been in use by sister stations [[KNBC]] in [[Los Angeles]], [[KNSD]] in [[San Diego]], [[KNTV]] in [[San Francisco]] and by WNBC in New York City (in the case of WNBC, it no longer uses "L.A. Groove" as its news theme as of 2016).

On July 11, 2016 beginning with the 4:00&nbsp;p.m. newscast, WCAU became the seventh NBC-owned station to begin using ArtWorks' "Look N" graphics package following [[WNBC]] ([[New York City]]), WTVJ (Miami), [[WVIT]] ([[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]]), [[KXAS-TV]] ([[Dallas]]/[[Fort Worth, Texas|Fort Worth]]), [[WMAQ-TV]] ([[Chicago]]); [[WRC-TV]] ([[Washington, D.C.]]) began using the package in June.

On October 21, 2018, WCAU moved to their new studios within the Comcast Technology Center, beginning with the 6:00&nbsp;p.m. newscast. The logo was also simplified to remove the redundant "NBC" text and streamline the [[NBC Peacock]] and the "10" numeral together more closely, as had been done with sister station [[WYCN-LD|WBTS-LD]]'s new "10" logo upon their numerical rebranding to "NBC 10 [[Boston]]" at the start of 2018.

In August 2019, WCAU announced that the last 15 minutes of its 11:00&nbsp;a.m. newscast would be cut in favor of their lifestyle show ''Philly Live'' beginning September 9.

In February 2020, WCAU announced a content partnership with Philadelphia-based company [[Entercom Communications]] and its AM radio station [[KYW (AM)|KYW-AM]] along with its sister stations [[WIP-FM]], [[WTDY-FM]], [[WOGL-FM]], [[WPHT (AM)|WPHT-AM]] and [[WBEB-FM]] for use of WCAU's on-air talent on the radio stations; it is the second station partnership between Entercom and NBC (following KXAS-TV and [[KRLD (AM)|KRLD]] in Dallas beginning in 2018). Fellow NBC O&O stations had already partnered with radio stations in markets including Washington, D.C. (WRC-TV and [[WTOP-FM]]), New York City (WNBC and [[WOR (AM)|WOR]]), Los Angeles (KNBC and [[KABC (AM)|KABC-AM]]), Hartford (WVIT and [[WILI (AM)|WILI]]), and Miami (WTVJ and [[WIOD]]).<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/business/nbc10-telemundo62-announce-new-partnership-with-entercom-radio-stations/2292521/|title=NBC10, Telemundo62 Announced New Partnership With Entercom Radio Stations|work=WCAU|publisher=NBCUniversal Owned Television Stations|date=February 10, 2020|access-date=February 11, 2020}}</ref>

On February 17, 2020, WCAU added a half-hour 7 p.m. newscast on weekdays.

It was announced in July 2020 that Sikahema would be retiring from NBC10 in November of that year after a 26-year run at the station, stepping away from the anchor position but still being active around the station until fully retiring.<ref>https://fusion.inquirer.com/news/philadelphia/nbc10-vai-sikahema-retiring-retires-tracy-davidson-news-20200730.html#loaded</ref> Additionally, co-anchor Tracy Davidson would be shifting away from the morning editions to anchor the 4 p.m. and 5 p.m. newscasts alongside Jacqueline London and Jim Rosenfeld respectively. It was also revealed that previous 4 p.m. and 5 p.m. anchor team Keith Jones and Erin Coleman would take over the anchoring duties for the morning show. Sikahema and Davidson's last day anchoring the broadcast was on September 17, 2020, with Jones and Coleman taking over the next day.

On June 26, 1972, three news correspondents were killed in a helicopter crash in [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania]], where they had been covering the [[flood]]ing stemming from [[Hurricane Agnes]]. The victims were [[Del Vaughn]] of [[CBS News]] and Sid Brenner and Louis Clark of WCAU, and the pilot, Mike Sedio. The helicopter lost its rotor some three hundred feet above the Capital City Airport, crashed, and exploded on the [[runway]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www3.gendisasters.com/pennsylvania/12043/harrisburg-pa-helicopter-crash-june-1972|title=Four Die in 'Copter Crash, June 27, 1972|publisher=The Morning Herald, Uniontown, Pennsylvania|access-date=June 5, 2014}}</ref>

==Out-of-market carriage==
WCAU is carried in central and southern New Jersey on certain cable systems that generally receive local channels from New York. It is available from Comcast in select towns in southern [[Middlesex County, New Jersey|Middlesex County]], on digital channel 253, being moved there in December 2007 from analog channel 10 to "preserve bandwidth."{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}} In [[Monmouth County, New Jersey|Monmouth County]], WCAU is carried on [[Altice USA|Optimum]] Monmouth and Monmouth/[[Wall Township, New Jersey|Wall]]. All of [[Ocean County, New Jersey|Ocean County]] receives WCAU on Comcast and Cablevision systems, and for Ocean County Comcast subscribers, WCAU is on digital channel 253, for the same reasons above.

Comcast transmits WCAU to most of [[Sussex County, Delaware|Sussex County]] in Delaware, except for [[Fenwick Island, Delaware|Fenwick Island]] as the town uses former TCI (now Comcast) service, on channel 10. It is the only Philadelphia local channel remaining on the Limited Analog Service. [[Mediacom]] and [[Verizon FiOS]] do not broadcast WCAU in Sussex County.

Comcast and [[Blue Ridge Communications]] also carry WCAU in [[Lancaster County, Pennsylvania]].
