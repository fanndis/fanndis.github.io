'''Charles S.''' "'''Chuck'''" '''DeVore''' (born May 20, 1962) is an [[United States|American]] [[politician]] who served as a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] member of the [[California State Assembly]] from 2004 to 2010 when he lived in [[Irvine, California|Irvine]]<ref name=brief/> and represented the [[California's 70th State Assembly district|70th&nbsp;District]], which includes portions of [[Orange County, California|Orange County]]. DeVore was Vice Chair of the Assembly Revenue and Taxation Committee as well as Vice Chair of the [[Veteran]]s Affairs Committee. He also served on the Budget Committee and was a member of the Joint Legislative Audit Committee. After losing a 2010 bid for Republican nomination for the [[United States Senate]], in 2011 DeVore moved to Texas to work for the [[Texas Public Policy Foundation]] where he is now Vice President for National Initiatives.

[[File:Chuck-devore-086a.jpg|thumb|left|220px|DeVore, speaking to a meeting of the Fremont Tea Party Patriots.]]
DeVore served as Special Assistant for Foreign Affairs to the [[Assistant Secretary of Defense for Legislative Affairs]] during the Reagan administration from 1986 to 1988.<ref name=brief/> In 1992, his national guard unit was activated during the [[1992 Los Angeles riots]].<ref name=WillonLAT2010>{{cite news |last=Willon |first=Phil |date=20 May 2010 |title=Chuck DeVore has a staunch conservative record |url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2010-may-20-la-me-devore-20100521-story.html |work=Los Angeles Times |access-date=10 May 2019 }}</ref> He later worked as Vice President of Communications and Research for [[Irvine, California|Irvine]]-based aerospace company [[SM&A]] from 1991 to 2004.<ref name=brief/>

==Bills and domestic policy positions==

DeVore resigned his position as Chief Republican [[Whip (politics)|Whip]] in February 2009 in protest of a $12 billion per year tax increase agreed to by Republican leadership.<ref>[https://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS20936+15-Feb-2009+BW20090215 California Assemblyman Chuck DeVore Resigns Leadership Post Due to $14 Billion Tax Increase Deal] 2009-02-14</ref> While a California lawmaker, DeVore favored offshore oil drilling along the California coast as well as the development of modern nuclear power plants.

==Foreign policy positions==

DeVore has voiced reluctance to commit the U.S. military to open-ended nation building efforts. He criticized President Obama's 2009 plan for Afghanistan, saying, "(The) piecemeal buildup will not defeat the Taliban..." and "...such a strategy expends resources now sorely needed to rebuild our military and retool it for future challenges from a rapidly modernizing People's Republic of China to a revanchist Islamic Republic of Iran." <ref>{{cite news| url=http://blog.sfgate.com/politics/2009/12/01/gop-senate-candidates-react-to-obamas-afghanistan-plan/  | work=San Francisco Chronicle | first=Joe | last=Garofoli | title=GOP Senate candidates react to Obama's Afghanistan plan]   | date=2009-12-01}}</ref> He appeared on Fox Business News to warn about the Libyan intervention.<ref>[http://video.foxbusiness.com/v/4554002/qaddafis-political-future/?#sp=show-clips/ Qaddafi's Political Future]  2011-2-23</ref>

{{main|United States Senate election in California, 2010}}

DeVore declared his candidacy for the 2010 Republican nomination for the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]] seat held by three-term [[Democratic party (United States)|Democratic]] senator [[Barbara Boxer]].<ref>[http://www.sacbee.com/static/weblogs/capitolalertlatest/016928.html DeVore targets Boxer for 2010 Senate seat] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090628172947/http://www.sacbee.com/static/weblogs/capitolalertlatest/016928.html |date=2009-06-28 }}  2008-11-10</ref>

DeVore's campaign was sued for copyright infringement by musician [[Don Henley]] for use by the campaign of two parodies of two songs by Henley, "After the Hope of November is Gone" (after "The Boys of Summer") and   "All She Wants to Do is Tax" (after "All She Wants to Do Is Dance").
