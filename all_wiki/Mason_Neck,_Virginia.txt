'''Mason Neck''' is a [[peninsula]] jutting into the [[Potomac River]] to the south of [[Washington, D.C.]], in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Virginia]]. It is surrounded by [[Belmont Bay]] to the west, the Potomac River to the south and east, [[Gunston Cove]] to the northeast, and [[Pohick Creek|Pohick Bay]] to the north-northeast. The [[census-designated place]] (CDP) of Mason Neck forms the southernmost section of [[Fairfax County, Virginia|Fairfax County]], in [[northern Virginia]], and comprises an area of {{convert|51.8|sqkm|order=flip}},<ref name="Census 2010"/> two-thirds of which is preserved as parkland by regional, state, and national authorities. The population of the Mason Neck CDP was 2,005 as of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]].<ref name="Census 2010">{{Cite web| url=http://factfinder2.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/DEC/10_DP/G001/1600000US5149998| title=Geographic Identifiers: 2010 Demographic Profile Data (G001): Mason Neck CDP, Virginia| publisher=U.S. Census Bureau, American Factfinder| accessdate=October 13, 2016}}{{dead link|bot=medic|date=April 2020}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>

==History==
The Mason Neck peninsula was inhabited by the [[Doeg people|Doeg]] prior to the arrival of European settlers. The recorded history of Mason Neck began around 1755 with the construction of [[Gunston Hall]], the [[Plantation complexes in the Southern United States#Plantation house|plantation house]] of [[George Mason]], author of the [[Virginia Declaration of Rights]]. Mason Neck is also the location of [[Pohick Church]], frequented by both Mason and [[George Washington]], and [[Cranford Methodist Church]], which was built in 1857 and served as a hospital during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].

During the 19th and early 20th centuries, much of the land was used for the logging of mature [[pine]] and [[hardwood]] timber. Over time, pollution and habitat destruction caused a decline in the [[bald eagle]] population. By the 1960s, much of the forest had grown back, but residential development as a suburb of Washington posed another threat. In 1969, local residents and conservation groups achieved the establishment of the [[Elizabeth Hartwell Mason Neck National Wildlife Refuge]], with the specific objective of protecting the bald eagle.<ref>{{Cite web| url=https://www.fws.gov/refuge/Mason_Neck/about.html| title=About the Refuge| publisher=U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service| work=Elizabeth Hartwell Mason Neck National Wildlife Refuge| access-date=October 13, 2016}}</ref> This, along with [[Mason Neck State Park]] and [[Pohick Bay Regional Park]], provides a variety of recreational activities while preserving the land's natural resources.

During the 1980s, the Lynch family traded Fairfax County officials their Mason Neck land holdings in exchange for {{convert|900|acre}} of land near the Lorton Prison. This plot of land became the housing development known as [[Crosspointe, Virginia|Crosspointe]]. Many of the suburban subdivisions located around the Lorton Prison are built on land that the Lynch family once owned. The Mason Neck land that was traded to the county later became a state-controlled nature reserve called Meadowood.<ref>{{cite web|title=Meadowood History|url=https://www.blm.gov/es/st/en/fo/lpfo_html/meadowood_history.html|website=blm.gov|publisher=U.S. Department of the Interior|accessdate=27 January 2017|date=28 August 2015}}</ref>

==Wildlife==
In addition to bald eagles, Mason Neck is home to a variety of animal species. Birds include [[great blue heron]]s, [[Canada geese]], [[osprey]]s, [[wood duck]]s, [[green-winged teal|teal]], [[owl]]s, and [[woodpecker]]s. [[Whitetail deer]] are common, along with [[beaver]]s, [[muskrat]]s, [[groundhog]]s, and [[fox]]es. A diverse population of [[frog]]s and [[toad]]s can be heard on summer nights. [[Eastern box turtle]]s, eastern [[snapping turtle]]s, [[wood turtle]]s, and [[spotted turtle]]s can all be found around ponds, streams, and marshes, as well as [[snake]]s, such as the [[Agkistrodon contortrix mokasen|northern copperhead]] and the [[coluber constrictor|northern black racer]].
