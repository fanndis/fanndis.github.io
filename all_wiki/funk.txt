'''Funk''' is a [[music genre]] that originated in [[African Americans|African American]] communities in the mid-[[1960s in music|1960s]] when musicians created a [[Rhythm|rhythmic]], [[dance]]able new form of music through a mixture of soul, jazz, and rhythm and blues (R&B). Funk de-emphasizes [[melody]] and [[chord progressions]] and focuses on a strong rhythmic [[groove (music)|groove]] of a [[bassline]] played by an [[electric bass]]ist and a drum part played by a [[drum kit|drummer]], often at slower tempos than other popular music. Like much of [[Music of Africa|African-inspired music]], funk typically consists of a complex groove with [[Rhythm section|rhythm instruments]] playing interlocking grooves that create a "hypnotic" and "danceable" feel.<ref name="stewart1">{{cite web |url=https://www.soundonsound.com/techniques/top-brass-part-2 |title=Top Brass: Part 2 Arranging For Brass |last=Stewart |first=Dave |date=July 2015 |website=soundonsound.com |publisher=Sound on Sound |access-date=18 April 2019 |quote=}}</ref> Funk uses the same richly colored [[extended chord]]s found in [[bebop]] jazz, such as [[minor chord]]s with added sevenths and elevenths, or [[dominant seventh]] chords with altered ninths and thirteenths.

Funk originated in the mid-1960s, with [[James Brown]]'s development of a signature groove that emphasized the [[Beat (music)#Downbeat|downbeat]]—with heavy emphasis on the first beat of every [[Bar (music)|measure]] ("The One"), and the application of swung [[16th note]]s  and [[syncopation]] on all basslines, drum patterns, and guitar riffs<ref name="Slutsky, Allan 1997">Slutsky, Allan, Chuck Silverman (1997).

== Etymology ==
{{Wiktionary|funk}}
The word ''funk'' initially referred (and still refers) to a strong odor. It is originally derived from [[Latin]] "fumigare" (which means "to smoke") via [[Old French]] ''"fungiere"'' and, in this sense, it was first documented in English in 1620. In 1784 "funky" meaning "musty" was first documented, which, in turn, led to a sense of "earthy" that was taken up around 1900 in early jazz slang for something "deeply or strongly felt".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=funk|title=Online Etymology Dictionary – Funk|last=|first=|date=|website=Etymonline.com|language=en|access-date=January 20, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldwidewords.org/qa/qa-fun2.htm|title=World Wide Words: Funk|last=Quinion|first=Michael|date=October 27, 2001|website=World Wide Words|language=en-gb|access-date=January 20, 2017}}</ref> Ethnomusicologist [[Portia Maultsby]] states that the expression "funk" comes from the Central African word ''"lu-funki"'' and art historian [[Robert Farris Thompson]] says the word comes from the [[Kikongo]] term ''"lu-fuki"''; in both proposed origins, the term refers to ''body odor''.<ref>Thompson, Gordon E. ''Black Music, Black Poetry: Blues and Jazz's Impact on African American Versification''.
Routledge, Apr. 15, 2016. p. 80.</ref> Thompson's proposed Kikongo origin word, "lu-fuki" is used by African musicians to praise people "for the integrity of their art" and for having "worked out" to reach their goals.<ref name="autogenerated80">Thompson, Gordon E. ''Black Music, Black Poetry: Blues and Jazz's Impact on African American Versification''. Routledge, Apr. 15, 2016. p. 80.</ref> Even though in white culture, the term "funk" can have negative connotations of odor or being in a bad mood ("in a funk"), in African communities, the term "funk", while still linked to body odor, had the positive sense that a musician's hard-working, honest effort led to sweat, and from their "physical exertion" came an "exquisite" and "superlative" performance.<ref name="autogenerated80"/>

In early [[jam session]]s, musicians would encourage one another to "[[get down]]" by telling one another, "Now, put some ''stank'' on it!". At least as early as 1907, [[jazz]] songs carried titles such as ''Funky''. The first example is an unrecorded number by [[Buddy Bolden]], remembered as either "[[Buddy Bolden#"Funky"|Funky Butt]]" or "Buddy Bolden's Blues" with improvised lyrics that were, according to Donald M. Marquis, either "comical and light" or "crude and downright obscene" but, in one way or another, referring to the sweaty atmosphere at dances where Bolden's band played.<ref>Donald M. Marquis: In Search of Buddy Bolden, Louisiana State University Press, 2005, pp. 108–111 {{ISBN|978-0-8071-3093-3}}</ref><ref name=RealMusicForum>[http://www.realmusicforum.com/history/who-started-funk-music/2008122356/ Who Started Funk Music] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091009054718/http://www.realmusicforum.com/history/who-started-funk-music/2008122356/ |date=October 9, 2009 }}, ''Real Music Forum''</ref> As late as the 1950s and early 1960s, when "funk" and "funky" were used increasingly in the context of [[jazz music]], the terms still were considered indelicate and inappropriate for use in polite company. According to one source, [[New Orleans]]-born drummer [[Earl Palmer]] "was the first to use the word 'funky' to explain to other musicians that their music should be made more syncopated and danceable."<ref name=Guardian>[https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/sep/23/popandrock.usa Obituary, ''[[Guardian (newspaper)|The Guardian]]]''</ref> The style later evolved into a rather hard-driving, insistent rhythm, implying a more ''carnal quality''. This early form of the music set the pattern for later musicians.<ref>Merriam-Webster, Inc, [https://archive.org/details/merriamwebsterne00merr/page/175 <!-- quote=funk origins of word. --> ''The Merriam-Webster New Book of Word Histories''] (Merriam-Webster, 1991), {{ISBN|0-87779-603-3}}, p. 175.</ref> The music was identified as slow, sexy, loose, [[riff]]-oriented and danceable.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

== Characteristics ==

=== Rhythm and tempo===
[[File:Meters Wikepedia.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.1|The [[rhythm section]] of a funk band—the electric bass, drums, electric guitar and keyboards--is the heartbeat of the funk sound. Pictured here is [[the Meters]].]]
Like soul, funk is based on [[dance music]], so it has a strong "rhythmic role".<ref name=Learn254>Learn Guitar: From Beginner to Pro. Book Sales, 2017. p. 254</ref> The sound of funk is as much based on the "spaces between the notes" as the notes that are played; as such, rests between notes are important.<ref name=Gress>{{cite web |url=https://www.guitarplayer.com/technique/10-ways-to-play-like-prince |title=10 Ways to Play Guitar Like Prince |last=Gress |first=Jesse |date=21 April 2016 |website=guitarplayer.com |publisher=Guitar Player |access-date=13 April 2019 |quote=}}</ref> While there are rhythmic similarities between funk and [[disco]], funk has a "central dance beat that's slower, sexier and more syncopated than disco", and funk rhythm section musicians add more "subtextures", complexity and "personality" onto the main beat than a programmed synth-based disco ensemble.<ref name= Himes>{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1979/08/01/on-the-difference-between-funk-and-disco/25fcc5c6-1a13-4d64-9e99-a67dbd004b9a/?noredirect=on |title=On the Difference Between Funk and Disco |last=Himes |first=Geoffrey |date=1 August 1979 |website=washingtonpost.com |publisher=Washington Post |access-date=13 April 2019 |quote=}}</ref>

Before funk, most [[pop music]] was based on sequences of eighth notes, because the fast tempos made further subdivisions of the beat infeasible.<ref name="stewart1"/> The innovation of funk was that by using slower tempos (surely influenced by the revival of blues at early 60s), funk "created space for further rhythmic subdivision, so a bar of 4/4 could now accommodate possible 16  note  placements."<ref name="stewart1"/>  Specifically, by having the guitar and drums play in "motoring" sixteenth-note rhythms, it created the opportunity for the other instruments to play "more syncopated, broken-up style", which facilitated a move to more "liberated" basslines. Together, these "interlocking parts" created a "hypnotic" and "danceable feel".<ref name="stewart1"/>

A great deal of funk is rhythmically based on a two-[[cell (music)|celled]] onbeat/offbeat structure, which originated in [[sub-Saharan African music traditions]]. New Orleans appropriated the bifurcated structure from the Afro-Cuban mambo and conga in the late 1940s, and made it its own.<ref name="autogenerated1979">Palmer, Robert (1979: 14), ''A Tale of Two Cities: Memphis Rock and New Orleans Roll. Brooklyn.</ref> New Orleans funk, as it was called, gained international acclaim largely because James Brown's rhythm section used it to great effect.<ref>Stewart, Alexander (2000: 293), "Funky Drummer: New Orleans, James Brown and the Rhythmic Transformation of American Popular Music", ''Popular Music'', v. 19, n. 3, October 2000, pp.&nbsp;293–318.</ref>

[[File:Funk.tiff|thumb|center|upright=1.8|Simple kick and snare funk motif. The kick first sounds two onbeats, which are then answered by two offbeats. The snare sounds the backbeat.]]

=== Harmony ===
[[File:Thirteenth chord collapsed.png|thumb|A [[thirteenth chord]] (E 13, which also contains a flat 7th and a 9th) {{Audio|Thirteenth chord collapsed.mid|Play}}]]
Funk uses the same richly colored [[extended chord]]s found in [[bebop]] jazz, such as minor chords with added sevenths and elevenths, or dominant seventh chords with altered ninths. Some examples of chords used in funk are minor eleventh chords (e.g., F minor 11th); dominant seventh with added sharp ninth and a suspended fourth (e.g., C7 (#9) sus 4); dominant ninth chords (e.g., F9); and minor sixth chords (e.g., C minor 6).<ref name=Gress/> The six-ninth chord is used in funk (e.g., F 6/9); it is a major chord with an added sixth and ninth.<ref name=Gress/> In funk, minor seventh chords are more common than minor triads because minor triads were found to be too "thin"-sounding.<ref>Studley, Greg. ''Essentials of Rhythm Guitar: Complete Guide''. Jun. 21, 2016.</ref> Some of the best known and most skillful soloists in funk have [[jazz]] backgrounds. Trombonist [[Fred Wesley]] and saxophonist [[Pee Wee Ellis]] and [[Maceo Parker]] are among the most notable musicians in the funk music genre, having worked with [[James Brown (musician)|James Brown]], [[George Clinton (funk musician)|George Clinton]] and [[Prince (musician)|Prince]].

However, unlike bebop jazz, with its complex, rapid-fire chord changes, funk virtually abandoned chord changes, creating static single chord [[vamp (music)|vamps]] (often alternating a minor seventh chord and a related dominant seventh chord, such as A minor to D7) with [[Traditional sub-Saharan African harmony|melodo-harmonic movement]] and a complex, driving rhythmic feel. Even though some funk songs are mainly one-chord vamps, the rhythm section musicians may embellish this chord by moving it up or down a semitone or a tone to create chromatic passing chords. For example, "[[Play that funky music]]" (by [[Wild Cherry (band)|Wild Cherry]]) mainly uses an E ninth chord, but it also uses F#9 and F9.<ref>Serna, Desi. ''Guitar Theory For Dummies: Book + Online Video & Audio Instruction''. John Wiley & Sons, Sep. 24, 2013. p. 156</ref>

The chords used in funk songs typically imply a [[Dorian mode|Dorian]] or [[Mixolydian mode]], as opposed to the major or natural minor tonalities of most popular music. Melodic content was derived by mixing these modes with the [[blues scale]]. In the 1970s, jazz music drew upon funk to create a new subgenre of [[jazz-funk]], which can be heard in recordings by [[Miles Davis]] (''[[Live-Evil (Miles Davis album)|Live-Evil]]'', ''[[On the Corner]]''), and [[Herbie Hancock]] (''[[Head Hunters]]'').

===Improvisation===
Funk continues the African musical tradition of [[improvisation]], in that in a funk band, the group would typically "feel" when to change, by "jamming" and "grooving", even in the studio recording stage, which might only be based on the skeleton framework for each song.<ref>Vincent, Rickey. ''Funk: The Music, The People, and The Rhythm of The One''. St. Martin's Press, Nov. 4, 2014; p. 18</ref> Funk uses "collective improvisation", in which musicians at rehearsals would have what was metaphorically a musical "conversation", an approach which extended to the onstage performances.<ref>Lacy, Travis K., ""Funk is its own reward" : an analysis of selected lyrics in popular funk music of the 1970s" (2008). ETD Collection for AUC Robert W. Woodruff Library. Paper 22. pp. 51–52</ref>

===Instruments and vocals===
====Bass====
[[File:Bootsy Collins-04.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Bootsy Collins performing in 1996 with a star-shaped bass]]
Funk creates an intense [[Groove (popular music)|groove]] by using strong guitar riffs and [[bassline]]s played on [[electric bass]]. Like [[Motown]] recordings, funk songs use basslines as the centerpiece of songs. Indeed, funk has been called the style in which the bassline is most prominent in the songs,<ref>Archard, Chuck. ''Building Bass Lines''. Alfred Music Publishing, 1998</ref> with the bass playing the "hook" of the song.<ref name=Boomer25>Boomer, Tim; Berry, Mick. ''The Bassist's Bible: How to Play Every Bass Style from Afro-Cuban to Zydeco''. See Sharp Press, Jul. 1, 2009. p. 25</ref> Early funk basslines used syncopation (typically syncopated eighth notes), but with the addition of more of a "driving feel" than in New Orleans funk, and they used [[blues scale]] notes along with the major third above the root.<ref>Boomer, Tim; Berry, Mick. ''The Bassist's Bible: How to Play Every Bass Style from Afro-Cuban to Zydeco''. See Sharp Press, Jul. 1, 2009. p. 22</ref> Later funk basslines use sixteenth note syncopation, blues scales, and repetitive patterns, often with leaps of an octave or a larger interval.<ref name=Boomer25/>
[[File:Funky Slap Bass line.ogg|thumb|right|200px|This funky bassline includes percussive slapping, rhythmic ghost notes, and glissando effects.]]
Funk basslines emphasize repetitive patterns, locked-in grooves, continuous playing, and [[Slapping (music)|slap and popping]] bass. Slapping and popping uses a mixture of thumb-slapped low notes (also called "thumped") and finger "popped" (or plucked) high notes, allowing the bass to have a drum-like rhythmic role, which became a distinctive element of funk. Notable slap and funky players include [[Bernard Edwards]] (Chic), [[Robert "Kool" Bell]], Mark Adams (Slave), Johnny Flippin (Fatback)<ref>http://www.allmusic.com/artist/johnny-flippin-mn0001326101</ref> and [[Bootsy Collins]].<ref name=Overthrow>Overthrow, David. ''Complete Electric Bass Method: Mastering Electric Bass''. Alfred Music</ref> While slap and funky is important, some influential bassists who play funk, such as [[Rocco Prestia]] (from [[Tower of Power]]), did not use the approach, and instead used a typical fingerstyle method based on [[James Jamerson]]'s [[Motown]] playing style.<ref name=Overthrow/> [[Larry Graham]] from [[Sly and the Family Stone]] is an influential bassist.<ref name=Dickens>Dickens, Bill "the Buddha"; Rock, Bobby. ''Funk Bass and Beyond''. Alfred Music Publishing, 2003</ref>

Funk bass has an "earthy, percussive kind of feel", in part due to the use of muted, rhythmic [[ghost note]]s<ref name=Dickens/> (also called "dead notes").<ref name=Overthrow/> Some funk bass players use electronic [[effects unit]]s to alter the tone of their instrument, such as "envelope filters" (an auto-[[wah]] effect that creates a "gooey, slurpy, quacky, and syrupy" sound)<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.premierguitar.com/articles/how-to-funk-up-your-bass-1 |title=How to Funk Up Your Bass |last=Berkowitz |first=Dan |date=14 January 2008 |website=premierguitar.com |publisher=Premier Guitar |access-date=9 April 2019 |quote=}}</ref> and imitate keyboard synthesizer bass tones<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.dummies.com/art-center/music/bass-guitar/effects-pedals-for-your-bass-guitar/ |title=Effects Pedals for Your Bass Guitar |last=Pfeiffer |first=Patrick |date= |website=dummies.com |publisher=Dummies |access-date=9 April 2019 |quote=}}</ref> (e.g., the [[Mutron]] envelope filter)<ref name=Boomer25/> and overdriven [[fuzz bass]] effects, which are used to create the "classic fuzz tone that sounds like old school Funk records".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.guitarinteractivemagazine.com/issues/issue-50/reviews/electro-harmonix-bass-blogger-bass-metaphors-and-bass-micro-synthesizer/ |title=Electro-Harmonix Bass Blogger, Bass Metaphors and Bass Micro Synthesizer |last=Veall|first=Dan |date= |website=guitarinteractivemagazine.com |publisher=Guitar Interactive Magazine |access-date=9 April 2019 |quote=}}</ref> Other effects that are used include the [[flanger]] and [[bass chorus]].<ref name=Boomer25/> Collins also used a [[Mu-Tron#Mu-tron Octave Divider|Mu-Tron Octave Divider]], an octave pedal that, like the Octavia pedal popularized by Hendrix, can double a note an octave above and below to create a "futuristic and fat low-end sound".<ref name="dearcangelis1">{{cite web |url=https://reverb.com/ca/news/the-essential-gear-of-parliament-slash-funkadelic |title=The Essential Gear of Parliament/Funkadelic |last=DeArcangelis |first=Christopher |date=6 January 2017 |website=reverb.com |publisher=Reverb |access-date=4 May 2019 |quote=}}</ref>

====Drums====
Funk drumming creates a groove by emphasizing the drummer's "feel and emotion", which including "occasional tempo fluctuations", the use of [[Swing music|swing]] feel in some songs (e.g., "Cissy Strut" by [[The Meters]] and "I'll Take You There" by [[The Staple Singers]], which have a half-swung feel), and less use of [[fill (music)|fills]] (as they can lessen the groove).<ref name=Schlueter>{{cite web |url=https://reverb.com/ca/news/10-old-school-funk-grooves-every-drummer-should-know |title=10 Old School Funk Grooves Every Drummer Should Know |last=Schlueter |first=Brad |date=13 May 2016 |website=reverb.com |publisher=Reverb |access-date=9 April 2019 |quote=}}</ref> Drum fills are "few and economical", to ensure that the drumming stays "in the pocket", with a steady tempo and groove.<ref>Burns, Roy; Farris, Joey. ''Studio Funk Drumming: A Professional Workbook''. Alfred Music, 1981. p. 6</ref> These playing techniques are supplemented by a set-up for the drum kit that often includes muffled [[bass drum]]s and toms and tightly tuned snare drums.<ref name=Schlueter/> [[Double bass drumming]] sounds are often done by funk drummers with a single pedal, an approach which "accents the second note... [and] deadens the drumhead's resonance", which gives a short, muffled bass drum sound.<ref name=Schlueter/>
[[File:Cissy Strut drum groove.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The drum groove from "[[Cissy Strut]]"]]

James Brown used two drummers such as Clyde Stubblefield and John 'Jabo' Starks in recording and soul show<ref name="autogenerated53">Lacy, Travis K., ""Funk is its own reward" : an analysis of selected lyrics in popular funk music of the 1970s" (2008). ETD Collection for AUC Robert W. Woodruff Library. Paper 22. p. 53</ref> By using two drummers, the JB band was able to maintain a "solid syncopated" rhythmic sound, which contributed to the band's distinctive "Funky Drummer" rhythm.<ref name="autogenerated53"/>

In [[Tower Of Power]] drummer [[David Garibaldi (musician)|David Garibaldi]]'s playing, there are many "ghost notes" and [[rim shot]]s.<ref name=Schlueter/> A key part of the funk drumming style is using the hi-hat, with opening and closing the hi-hats during playing (to create "splash" accent effects) being an important approach.<ref>Burns, Roy; Farris, Joey. ''Studio Funk Drumming: A Professional Workbook''. Alfred Music, 1981. pp. 5–6</ref> Two-handed sixteenth notes on the hi-hats, sometimes with a degree of swing feel, is used in funk.<ref name=Schlueter/>

Jim Payne states that funk drumming uses a "wide-open" approach to improvisation around rhythmic ideas from Latin music, [[ostinato]]s, that are repeated "with only slight variations", an approach which he says causes the "mesmerizing" nature of funk.<ref name="autogenerated7">Payne, Jim. ''Complete Funk Drumming Book''. Mel Bay Publications, Feb. 9, 2011. p. 7-8</ref> Payne states that funk can be thought of as "rock played in a more syncopated manner", particularly with the bass drum, which plays syncopated "eighth note" and "sixteenth note" patterns that were innovated by drummer Clive Williams (with [[Joe Tex]]); [[George Brown (musician)|George Brown]] (with [[Kool & the Gang]]) and James "Diamond" Williams (with [[The Ohio Players]]).<ref>Payne, Jim. ''Complete Funk Drumming Book''. Mel Bay Publications, Feb. 9, 2011. p. 8</ref> As with rock, the snare [[backbeat]]s on beats two and four are still used in most funk (albeit with additional soft ghost notes).<ref name="autogenerated7"/>

====Electric guitar====
In funk, guitarists often mix playing chords of a short duration (nicknamed "stabs") with faster rhythms and riffs.<ref name=Learn254/> Guitarists playing rhythmic parts often play sixteenth notes, including with percussive "ghost notes".<ref name=Learn254/> Chord extensions are favored, such as ninth chords.<ref name=Learn254/> Typically, funk uses "two interlocking [electric] guitar parts", with a [[rhythm guitar]]ist and a "tenor guitarist" who plays single notes. The two guitarists trade off their lines to create a "[[call and response|call-and-response]], intertwined pocket."<ref name=Bortnick>{{cite web |url=https://www.premierguitar.com/articles/Rhythm_Rules_Call_and_Response_Funk_Guitar |title=Rhythm Rules: Call-and-Response Funk Guitar |last=Bortnick |first=Avi |date=12 March 2013 |website=premierguitar.com |publisher=Premier Guitar |access-date=13 April 2019 |quote=}}</ref> If a band only has one guitarist, this effect may be recreated by [[overdubbing]] in the studio, or, in a live show, by having a single guitarist play both parts, to the degree that this is possible.<ref name=Bortnick/>

In funk bands, guitarists typically play in a percussive style, using a style of picking called the ''"chank"'' or ''"chicken scratch"'',  in which the guitar strings are pressed lightly against the [[fingerboard]] and then quickly released just enough to get a muted “scratching” sound that is produced by rapid rhythmic strumming of the opposite hand near the [[Bridge (instrument)|bridge]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.musical-u.com/learn/the-funky-ones-what-makes-funk-guitar-what-it-is/|title=The Funky Ones — What Makes Funk Guitar What It Is - Musical U|date=August 15, 2016|website=Musical-u.com|accessdate=October 24, 2018}}</ref> Earliest examples of that technic used on rhythm and blues is listened on [[Johnny Otis]] song "[[Willie and the Hand Jive]]" in 1957, with the future James Brown band guitar player [[Jimmy Nolen]]. The technique can be broken down into three approaches: the "chika", the "chank" and the "choke". With the "chika" comes a muted sound of strings being hit against the fingerboard; "chank" is a staccato attack done by releasing the chord with the fretting hand after strumming it; and "choking" generally uses all the strings being strummed and heavily muted.<ref name=Gress/> 
[[File:NileRodgers2012.png|thumb|left|200px|Guitarist [[Nile Rodgers]] is best known for his performances with [[Chic (band)|Chic]].]]

The result of these factors was a rhythm guitar sound that seemed to float somewhere between the low-end thump of the [[Bass guitar|electric bass]] and the cutting tone of the [[Snare drum|snare]] and [[hi-hat]]s, with a rhythmically melodic feel that fell deep in the pocket. Guitarist [[Jimmy Nolen]], longtime guitarist for James Brown, developed this technique. On Brown's "[[Give It Up or Turnit a Loose]]" (1969), however, Jimmy Nolen's guitar part has a bare bones tonal structure. The pattern of attack-points is the emphasis, not the pattern of pitches. The guitar is used the way that an African drum, or idiophone would be used.

Funk guitarists playing rhythm guitar generally avoid [[distortion (music)|distortion]] effects and amp overdrive to get a clean sound, and given the importance of a crisp, high sound, [[Fender Stratocaster]]s and [[Fender Telecaster|Telecasters]] were widely used for their cutting treble tone.<ref name="bogdal1"/> The mids are often cut by guitarists to help the guitar sound different from the [[horn section]], keyboards and other instruments.<ref name="bogdal1"/> Given the focus on providing a rhythmic groove, and the lack of emphasis on instrumental guitar melodies and [[guitar solo]]s, sustain is not sought out by funk rhythm guitarists.<ref name="bogdal1"/> Funk rhythm guitarists use [[Dynamic range compression|compressor]] volume-control effects to enhance the sound of muted notes, which boosts the “clucking” sound and adds "percussive excitement to funk rhythms" (an approach used by [[Nile Rodgers]]).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.guitarplayer.com/technique/licks-tricks-and-riffs-for-a-variety-of-effects |title=Licks, Tricks and Riffs for a Variety of Effects |last=Kolb |first=Tom |date=20 March 2019 |website=guitarplayer.com |publisher=Guitar Player |access-date=19 April 2019 |quote=}}</ref>

Guitarist [[Eddie Hazel]] from [[Funkadelic]] is notable for his solo improvisation (particularly for the solo on "[[Maggot Brain]]") and guitar riffs, the tone of which was shaped by a [[Maestro FZ-1 Fuzz-Tone]] pedal.<ref name="dearcangelis1"/> Hazel, along with guitarist [[Ernie Isley]] of [[the Isley Brothers]], was influenced by [[Jimi Hendrix]]'s improvised, wah-wah infused solos. Ernie Isley was tutored at an early age by Hendrix, when Hendrix was a part of the Isley Brothers backing band and temporarily lived in the Isleys' household. Funk guitarists use the [[Wah-wah pedal|wah-wah]] sound effect along with muting the notes to create a percussive sound for their guitar riffs. The [[phaser (effect)|phaser]] effect is often used in funk and R&B guitar playing for its filter sweeping sound effect, an example being the [[Isley Brothers]]' song "[[Who's That Lady]]".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://flypaper.soundfly.com/play/guitar-pedal-tone/ |title=Finding Your Ideal Guitar Tone: Guitar Pedals |last=Anbar   |first=Elyadeen|date=10 October 2015 |website=flypaper.soundfly.com |publisher=Flypaper |access-date=19 April 2015 |quote=}}</ref> [[Michael Hampton]], another P-Funk guitarist, was able to play Hazel's virtuosic solo on "Maggot Brain", using a solo approach that added in string bends and Hendrix-style [[feedback (music)|feedback]].<ref name="dearcangelis1"/>

====Keyboards====
[[File:Isaac hayes 1973.jpg|thumb|right|170px|[[Isaac Hayes]] playing keyboards in 1973]]
A range of keyboard instruments are used in funk. Acoustic piano is used in funk, including in “September” by [[Earth Wind & Fire]] and “[[Will It Go Round in Circles]]” by [[Billy Preston]]. The electric piano is used on songs such as [[Herbie Hancock]]’s “Chameleon” (a [[Fender Rhodes]]) and “Mercy, Mercy, Mercy” by [[Joe Zawinul]] (a [[Wurlitzer]]). The [[clavinet]] is used for its percussive tone, and it can be heard in songs such as [[Stevie Wonder]]'s “[[Superstition (song)|Superstition]]” and “[[Higher Ground (Stevie Wonder song)|Higher Ground]]” and Bill Withers' “[[Use Me (Bill Withers song)|Use Me]]”. The [[Hammond B-3 organ]] is used in funk, in songs such as “Cissy Strut” by [[The Meters]] and “Love the One You’re With” (with Aretha Franklin singing and Billy Preston on keyboards).

[[Bernie Worrell]]'s range of keyboards from his recordings with [[Parliament Funkadelic]] demonstrate the wide range of keyboards used in funk, as they include the Hammond organ ("Funky Woman", "Hit It and Quit It", "Wars of Armageddon"); [[Rocky Mount Instruments|RMI electric piano]] ("I Wanna Know If It's Good to You?", "[[Free Your Mind... and Your Ass Will Follow|Free Your Mind]]", "Loose Booty"); acoustic piano ("Funky Dollar Bill", "Jimmy's Got a Little Bit of Bitch in Him"); clavinet ("Joyful Process", "Up for the Down Stroke", "Red Hot Mama"); [[Minimoog]] synthesizer ("Atmosphere", "[[Flash Light (song)|Flash Light]]", "Aqua Boogie", "Knee Deep", "Let's Take It to the Stage"); and ARP string ensemble synth ("[[Chocolate City (album)|Chocolate City]]", "[[Give Up the Funk (Tear the Roof off the Sucker)]]", "Undisco Kidd").

Synthesizers were used in funk both to add to the deep sound of the electric bass, or even to replace the electric bass altogether in some songs.<ref name="autogenerated51">Lacy, Travis K., ""Funk is its own reward" : an analysis of selected lyrics in popular funk music of the 1970s" (2008). ETD Collection for AUC Robert W. Woodruff Library. Paper 22. p. 51</ref> Funk synthesizer bass, most often a [[Minimoog]], was used because it could create layered sounds and new electronic tones that were not feasible on electric bass.<ref name="autogenerated51"/>

===Vocals and lyrics===
In the 1970s, funk used many of the same vocal styles that were used in African-American music in the 1960s, including singing influences from blues, gospel, jazz and doo-wop.<ref name="autogenerated53"/> Like these other African-American styles, funk used "[y]ells, shouts, hollers, moans, humming, and melodic riffs", along with styles such as [[Call and response (music)|Call and Response]] and narration of stories (like the African oral tradition approach).<ref>Lacy, Travis K., "Funk is its own reward" : an analysis of selected lyrics in popular funk music of the 1970s" (2008). ETD Collection for AUC Robert W. Woodruff Library. Paper 22. p. 48</ref> The call and response in funk can be between the lead singer and the band members who act as [[backup vocal]]ists.<ref name="autogenerated75">Lacy, Travis K., ""Funk is its own reward" : an analysis of selected lyrics in popular funk music of the 1970s" (2008). ETD Collection for AUC Robert W. Woodruff Library. Paper 22. p. 75</ref>

As funk emerged from soul, the vocals in funk share soul's approach; however, funk vocals tend to be "more punctuated, energetic, rhythmically percussive[,] and less embellished" with ornaments, and the vocal lines tend to resemble horn parts and have "pushed" rhythms.<ref>Harrison, Scott D.; O'Bryan, Jessica. ''Teaching Singing in the 21st Century''. Springer, May 14, 2014. p. 49</ref> Funk bands such as [[Earth, Wind & Fire]] have [[harmony vocal]] parts.<ref name=Himes/> Songs like "[[Super Bad (song)|Super Bad]]" by James Brown included "double-voice" along with "yells, shouts and screams".<ref>Lacy, Travis K., ""Funk is its own reward" : an analysis of selected lyrics in popular funk music of the 1970s" (2008).

[[File:Charlie Wilson-photo-by-raymond-boyd.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Singer [[Charlie Wilson (singer)|Charlie Wilson]]]]
The lyrics in funk music addressed issues faced by the African American community in the United States during the 1970s, which arose due to the move away from an industrial, working-class economy to an information economy, which harmed the Black working class.<ref>Lacy, Travis K., ""Funk is its own reward" : an analysis of selected lyrics in popular funk music of the 1970s" (2008). ETD Collection for

The Funkadelic song "[[One Nation Under A Groove]]" (1978) is about the challenges that Blacks overcame during the 1960s civil rights movement, and it includes an exhortation for Blacks in the 1970s to capitalize on the new "social and political opportunities" that had become available in the 1970s.<ref>Lacy, Travis K., ""Funk is its own reward" : an analysis of selected lyrics in popular funk music of the 1970s" (2008).

Paper 22. p. 26</ref> The [[Isley Brothers]] song "Fight the Power" (1975) has a political message.<ref>Lacy, Travis K., ""Funk is its own reward" : an analysis of selected lyrics in popular funk music of the 1970s" (2008). ETD Collection for AUC Robert W. Woodruff Library. Paper 22. p. 57</ref> Parliament's song "Chocolate City" (1975) metaphorically refers to Washington D.C. and other US cities that have a mainly Black population, and it draws attention to the potential power that Black voters wield and suggests that a Black President be considered in the future.<ref>Lacy, Travis K., ""Funk is its own reward" : an analysis of selected lyrics in popular funk music of the 1970s" (2008). ETD Collection for AUC Robert W. Woodruff Library. Paper 22. p. 29</ref>

The political themes of funk songs and the aiming of the messages to a Black audience echoed the new image of Blacks that was created in [[Blaxploitation]] films, which depicted "African-American men and women standing their ground and fighting for what was right".<ref name="autogenerated36">Lacy, Travis K., ""Funk is its own reward" : an analysis of selected lyrics in popular funk music of the 1970s" (2008). ETD Collection for AUC Robert W. Woodruff Library. Paper 22. p. 36</ref> Both funk and Blaxploitation films addressed issues faced by Blacks and told stories from a Black perspective.<ref name="autogenerated36"/> Another link between 1970s funk and Blaxploitation films is that many of these films used funk soundtracks (e.g., [[Curtis Mayfield]] for ''[[Super Fly (1972 film)|Superfly]]''; James Brown and Fred Wesley for ''[[Black Caesar (film)|Black Caesar]]'' and [[War (American band)|War]] for ''[[Youngblood (1978 film)|Youngblood]]'').<ref>Lacy, Travis K., ""Funk is its own reward" : an analysis of selected lyrics in popular funk music of the 1970s" (2008). ETD Collection for AUC Robert W. Woodruff Library. Paper 22. pp. 55–56</ref>

Funk songs included metaphorical language that was understood best by listeners who were "familiar with the black aesthetic and [black] vernacular".<ref name="autogenerated66">Lacy, Travis K., ""Funk is its own reward" : an analysis of selected lyrics in popular funk music of the 1970s" (2008). ETD Collection for AUC Robert W. Woodruff Library. Paper 22. p. 66</ref> For example, funk songs included expressions such as "shake your money maker", "funk yourself right out" and "move your boogie body".<ref>Lacy, Travis K., ""Funk is its own reward" : an analysis of selected lyrics in popular funk music of the 1970s" (2008). ETD Collection for AUC Robert W. Woodruff Library. Paper 22. p. 72</ref> Another example is the use of "bad" in the song "Super Bad" (1970), which black listeners knew meant "good" or "great".<ref name="autogenerated75"/>

In the 1970s, to get around radio obscenity restrictions, funk artists would use words that sounded like non-allowed words and [[double entendre]]s to get around these restrictions.<ref name="citypages1">{{cite web |url=http://www.citypages.com/music/funks-five-most-ridiculous-lyrics-6629603 |title=Funk's five most ridiculous lyrics |author=<!--Not stated--> |website=citypages.com |publisher=City Pages |access-date=20 April 2019 |quote=}}</ref> For example, [[The Ohio Players]] had a song entitled "Fopp" which referred to "Fopp me right, don't you fopp me wrong/We'll be foppin' all night long...".<ref name="citypages1"/> Some funk songs used made-up words which suggested that they were "writing lyrics in a constant haze of marijuana smoke", such as Parliament's "[[Aqua Boogie (A Psychoalphadiscobetabioaquadoloop)]]", which includes words such as "bioaquadooloop".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.citypages.com/music/funks-five-most-ridiculous-lyrics-6629603 |title=Funk's five most ridiculous lyrics |author=<!--Not stated--> |website=citypages.com |publisher=City Pages |access-date=20 April 2019 |quote=}}</ref> The mainstream white listener base was often not able to understand funk's lyrical messages, which contributed to funk's lack of popular music chart success with white audiences during the 1970s.<ref>Lacy, Travis K., "Funk is its own reward" : an analysis of selected lyrics in popular funk music of the 1970s" (2008). ETD Collection for AUC Robert W. Woodruff Library. Paper 22. p. 56-57</ref>

===Other instruments===
[[Horn section]] arrangements with groups of brass instruments are often used in funk songs.<ref name=Himes/> Funk horn sections could include saxophone (often tenor sax), trumpet, trombone, and for larger horn sections, such as quintets and sextets, a baritone sax.<ref name="stewart1"/> Horn sections played "rhythmic and syncopated" parts, often with "offbeat phrases" that emphasize "rhythmic displacement".<ref name="stewart1"/> Funk song introductions are an important place for horn arrangements.<ref name="stewart1"/>

[[File:Earth Wind and Fire.jpg|thumb|left|270px|Funk [[horn section]]s typically include saxophones and trumpets. Larger horn sections often add a second instrument for one of the saxes or trumpets, and a trombone or bari sax may also be used. Pictured is the Earth, Wind and Fire horn section.]]

Funk horn sections performed in a "rhythmic percussive style" that mimicked the approach used by funk rhythm guitarists.<ref name="autogenerated48">Lacy, Travis K., ""Funk is its own reward" : an analysis of selected lyrics in popular funk music of the 1970s" (2008). ETD Collection for AUC Robert W. Woodruff Library. Paper 22. p. 48</ref> Horn sections would "punctuate" the lyrics by playing in the spaces between vocals, using "short staccato rhythmic blast[s]".<ref name="autogenerated48"/> Notable funk horn players included [[Alfred "Pee Wee" Ellis|Alfred "PeeWee" Ellis]], trombonist [[Fred Wesley]], and alto sax player [[Maceo Parker]].<ref name="autogenerated48"/> Notable funk horn sections including the "Phoenix Horns" (with Earth, Wind & Fire), the "Horny Horns" (with Parliament), the "Memphis Horns" (with [[Isaac Hayes]]), and "[[MFSB]]" (with [[Curtis Mayfield]]).<ref name="autogenerated48"/>

The instruments in funk horn sections varied. If there were two brass instruments, it could be trumpet and tenor sax, trumpet and trombone, or two saxes.<ref name="stewart1"/>  If there were three brass players, it could be trumpet, sax and trombone or a trumpet and two saxes.<ref name="stewart1"/> A quartet of brass instruments would often be a pair of an instrument type and two other instruments. Quintets would typically take a pair of brass instruments (saxes or trumpets), and add different high and low brass instruments. With six instruments, a brass section would typically be two pairs of brass instruments plus a trombone and baritone sax holding down the bottom end.<ref name="stewart1"/>

Notable songs with funk horn sections include:
* ''[[Cold Sweat]]'' (James Brown & the Famous Flames), 1967
* ''Superstition'' (Stevie Wonder), 1972
* ''Funky Stuff'' (Kool & The Gang), 1973
* ''What Is Hip?'' (Tower of Power), 1973
* ''[[Pick Up the Pieces (Average White Band song)|Pick Up the Pieces]]'' (Average White Band)
* ''[[Up For The Down Stroke]]'' (Parliament), 1974
* ''Hair'' (Graham Central Station), 1974
* ''[[Too Hot to Stop]]'' (The Bar-Kays), 1976
* ''[[Getaway (Earth, Wind & Fire song)|Getaway]]'' (Earth, Wind & Fire), 1976

In bands or shows where hiring a horn section is not feasible, a keyboardist can play the horn section parts on a synthesizer with "keyboard brass patches", however, choosing an authentic-sounding synthesizer and brass patch is important.<ref name="stewart1"/> In the 2010s, with micro-MIDI synths, it may even be possible to have another instrumentalist play the keyboard brass parts, thus enabling the keyboardist to continue to comp throughout the song.<ref name="stewart1"/>

===Costumes and style===
Funk bands in the 1970s adopted Afro-American fashion and style, including "[[Bell-bottoms|Bell-bottom pants]], platform shoes, hoop earring[s], Afros [hairstyles], leather vests,... beaded necklaces",<ref>Lacy, Travis K., ""Funk is its own reward" : an analysis of selected lyrics in popular funk music of the 1970s" (2008).

== History ==
The distinctive characteristics of [[African-American music]]al expression are rooted in [[sub-Saharan African music traditions]], and find their earliest expression in spirituals, work chants/songs, praise shouts, gospel, blues, and "body rhythms" ([[Juba dance|hambone]], [[patting juba]], and [[ring shout]] clapping and stomping patterns). Funk music is an amalgam of [[soul music]], [[soul jazz]], [[R&B]], and Afro-Cuban rhythms absorbed and reconstituted in New Orleans.  Like other styles of African-American musical expression including jazz, soul music and R&B, funk music accompanied many protest movements during and after the [[Civil Rights Movement]]. Funk allowed everyday experiences to be expressed to challenge daily struggles and hardships fought by lower and working class communities.

=== New Orleans ===
[[Gerhard Kubik]] notes that with the exception of [[New Orleans]], early blues lacked complex [[polyrhythm]]s, and there was a "very specific absence of asymmetric time-line patterns ([[bell pattern|key patterns]]) in virtually all early twentieth century African-American music&nbsp;... only in some New Orleans genres does a hint of simple time line patterns occasionally appear in the form of transient so-called 'stomp' patterns or stop-time chorus. These do not function in the same way as African time lines."<ref>Kubik (1999: 51). Africa and the Blues. Jackson, MI: [[University Press of Mississippi]].</ref>

In the late 1940s this changed somewhat when the two-celled time line structure was brought into [[New Orleans blues]]. New Orleans musicians were especially receptive to [[Afro-Cuban]] influences precisely at the time when R&B was first forming.<ref>"Rhythm and blues influenced by Afro-Cuban music first surfaced in New Orleans." Campbell, Michael, and James Brody (2007: 83). ''Rock and Roll: An Introduction''. Schirmer. {{ISBN|0-534-64295-0}}</ref> [[Dave Bartholomew]] and [[Professor Longhair]] (Henry Roeland Byrd) incorporated Afro-Cuban instruments, as well as the [[clave (rhythm)|clave]] pattern and related two-celled figures in songs such as "Carnival Day" (Bartholomew 1949) and "Mardi Gras In New Orleans" (Longhair 1949). [[Robert Palmer (writer)|Robert Palmer]] reports that, in the 1940s, Professor Longhair listened to and played with musicians from the islands and "fell under the spell of [[Perez Prado]]'s [[mambo (music)|mambo]] records."<ref name="autogenerated1979"/> Professor Longhair's particular style was known locally as ''rumba-boogie''.<ref>Stewart, Alexander (2000: 298). "Funky Drummer: New Orleans, James Brown and the Rhythmic Transformation of American Popular Music." ''Popular Music'', v. 19, n. 3. Oct. 2000), pp.&nbsp;293–318.</ref>

One of Longhair's great contributions was his particular approach of adopting two-celled, clave-based patterns into [[New Orleans rhythm and blues]] (R&B). Longhair's rhythmic approach became a basic template of funk. According to [[Dr. John]] (Malcolm John "Mac" Rebennack, Jr.), the Professor "put funk into music&nbsp;... Longhair's thing had a direct bearing I'd say on a large portion of the funk music that evolved in New Orleans."<ref>Dr. John quoted by Stewart (2000: 297).</ref> In his "Mardi Gras in New Orleans", the pianist employs the [[clave (rhythm)|2-3 clave]] onbeat/offbeat motif in a rumba-boogie "[[guajeo]]".<ref>Kevin Moore: "There are two common ways that the three-side [of clave] is expressed in Cuban popular music. The first to come into regular use, which David Peñalosa calls 'clave motif,' is based on the decorated version of the three-side of the clave rhythm. By the 1940s [there was] a trend toward the use of what Peñalosa calls the 'offbeat/onbeat motif.' Today, the offbeat/onbeat motif method is much more common." Moore (2011). ''Understanding Clave and Clave Changes'' p. 32. Santa Cruz, CA: Moore Music/Timba.com. {{ISBN|1466462302}}</ref>

The syncopated, but straight subdivision feel of Cuban music (as opposed to [[Swing (jazz performance style)|swung]] subdivisions) took root in New Orleans R&B during this time. Alexander Stewart states: "Eventually, musicians from outside of New Orleans began to learn some of the rhythmic practices [of the Crescent City]. Most important of these were James Brown and the drummers and arrangers he employed. Brown's early repertoire had used mostly shuffle rhythms, and some of his most successful songs were 12/8 ballads (e.g. 'Please, Please, Please' (1956), 'Bewildered' (1961), 'I Don't Mind' (1961)). Brown's change to a funkier brand of soul required 4/4 metre and a different style of drumming."<ref>Stewart (2000: 302).</ref> Stewart makes the point: "The singular style of rhythm & blues that emerged from New Orleans in the years after World {{nowrap|War II}} played an important role in the development of funk. In a related development, the underlying rhythms of American popular music underwent a basic, yet generally unacknowledged transition from triplet or shuffle feel to even or straight eighth notes."<ref name="Stewart2000-293">Stewart (2000: 293).</ref>

=== 1960s ===
====James Brown====
[[File:JamesBrown.jpg|thumb|right|James Brown, a progenitor of funk music]]
James Brown credited [[Little Richard]]'s 1950s R&B road band,The Up-setters from New Orleans, as "the first to put the funk into the rhythm" of [[rock and roll]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Little Richard: 20 Essential Songs|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/little-richard-20-essential-songs-15792/|last1=Harris|first1=Stephen Thomas Erlewine, Keith|last2=Erlewine|first2=Stephen Thomas|date=2020-05-09|website=Rolling Stone|language=en-US|access-date=2020-05-15|last3=Harris|first3=Keith}}</ref> Following his temporary exit from secular music to become an evangelist in 1957, some of Little Richard's band members joined Brown and [[the Famous Flames]], beginning a long string of hits for them in 1958. By the mid-1960s, [[James Brown]] had developed his signature groove that emphasized the [[Beat (music)#Downbeat|downbeat]]—with heavy emphasis on the first beat of every measure to etch his distinctive sound, rather than the [[Backbeat (music)|backbeat]] that typified African-American music.<ref>[http://www.anisman.com/steve/samd02.htm Lessons in listening – Concepts section: Fantasy, Earth Wind & Fire, The Best of Earth Wind & Fire Volume I, Freddie White.] (January 1998). ''Modern Drummer Magazine'', pp. 146–152. Retrieved January 21, 2007.</ref> Brown often cued his band with the command "On the one!," changing the percussion emphasis/accent from the one-'''''two'''''-three-'''''four''''' backbeat of traditional soul music to the '''''one'''''-two-three-four downbeat – but with an even-note [[Syncopation|syncopated]] guitar rhythm (on quarter notes two and four) featuring a hard-driving, repetitive brassy [[Swung note|swing]]. This one-three beat launched the shift in Brown's signature music style, starting with his 1964 hit single, "[[Out of Sight (song)|Out of Sight]]" and his 1965 hits, "[[Papa's Got a Brand New Bag]]" and "[[I Got You (I Feel Good)]]".

Brown's style of funk was based on interlocking, contrapuntal parts: syncopated [[bassline]]s, 16th beat drum patterns, and syncopated guitar riffs.<ref name="Slutsky, Allan 1997"/> The main guitar ostinatos for "Ain't it Funky" (c. late 1960s) are an example of Brown's refinement of New Orleans funk— an irresistibly danceable riff, stripped down to its rhythmic essence. On "Ain't it Funky" the tonal structure is barebones. Brown's innovations led to him and his band becoming the seminal funk act; they also pushed the funk music style further to the forefront with releases such as "[[Cold Sweat]]" (1967), "[[Mother Popcorn]]" (1969) and "[[Get Up (I Feel Like Being A) Sex Machine]]" (1970), discarding even the twelve-bar blues featured in his earlier music. Instead, Brown's music was overlaid with "catchy, anthemic vocals" based on "extensive vamps" in which he also used his voice as "a percussive instrument with frequent rhythmic grunts and with rhythm-section patterns&nbsp;... [resembling] West African polyrhythms" – a tradition evident in African-American work songs and chants.<ref name=jbmusicstyle>Collins, W. (January 29, 2002).

Retrieved January 12, 2007.</ref> Throughout his career, Brown's frenzied vocals, frequently punctuated with screams and grunts, channeled the "ecstatic ambiance of the black church" in a secular context.<ref name=jbmusicstyle/>

After 1965, Brown's bandleader and arranger was [[Alfred "Pee Wee" Ellis]]. Ellis credits [[Clyde Stubblefield]]'s adoption of New Orleans drumming techniques, as the basis of modern funk: "If, in a studio, you said 'play it funky' that could imply almost anything. But 'give me a New Orleans beat' – you got exactly what you wanted. And Clyde Stubblefield was just the epitome of this funky drumming."<ref>Alfred "Pee Wee" Ellis quoted by Stewart (2000: 303).</ref> Stewart states that the popular feel was passed along from "New Orleans—through James Brown's music, to the popular music of the 1970s."<ref name="Stewart2000-293"/> Concerning the various funk motifs, Stewart states that this model "...is different from a [[bell pattern|time line]] (such as clave and [[tresillo (rhythm)|tresillo)]] in that it is not an exact pattern, but more of a loose organizing principle."<ref>Stewart (2000: 306).</ref>

In a 1990 interview, Brown offered his reason for switching the rhythm of his music: "I changed from the upbeat to the downbeat&nbsp;... Simple as that, really."<ref name=nytimes>Pareles, J.

A new group of musicians began to further develop the "funk rock" approach.  Innovations were prominently made by [[George Clinton (funk musician)|George Clinton]], with his bands [[Parliament (band)|Parliament]] and [[Funkadelic]]. Together, they produced a new kind of funk sound heavily influenced by [[jazz]] and [[psychedelic rock]].  The two groups shared members and are often referred to collectively as "Parliament-Funkadelic." The breakout popularity of Parliament-Funkadelic gave rise to the term "[[P-Funk]]", which referred to the music by George Clinton's bands, and defined a new subgenre. Clinton played a principal role in several other bands, including [[Parlet]], the Horny Horns, and the Brides of Funkenstein, all part of the P-Funk conglomerate. "P-funk" also came to mean something in its quintessence, of superior quality, or ''[[sui generis]]''.

Following the work of Jimi Hendrix in the late 1960s, artists such as Sly and the Family Stone combined the psychedelic rock of Hendrix with funk, borrowing [[wah pedal]]s, [[fuzz box]]es, [[echo chamber]]s, and vocal distorters from the former, as well as [[blues rock]] and [[jazz]].<ref name="Scott">{{cite book|last1=Scott|first1=Derek B.|title=Dayton Street Funk: The Layering of Musical Identities|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eL37scDf0PMC&q=psychedelic+funk+genre|website=The Ashgate Research Companion to Popular Musicology|year=2009|accessdate=November 25, 2016|page=275|isbn=9780754664765}}</ref> In the following years, groups such as Clinton's Parliament-Funkadelic continued this sensibility, employing synthesizers and rock-oriented guitar work.<ref name="Scott"/>

=== Late 1960s – early 1970s ===
Other musical groups picked up on the rhythms and vocal style developed by [[James Brown]] and his band, and the funk style began to grow. [[Dyke and the Blazers]], based in [[Phoenix, Arizona]], released "[[Funky Broadway]]" in 1967, perhaps the first record of the [[soul music]] era to have the word "funky" in the title. In 1969 [[Jimmy McGriff]] released ''[[Electric Funk]]'', featuring his distinctive organ over a blazing horn section.  Meanwhile, on the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]], [[Charles Wright & the Watts 103rd Street Rhythm Band]] was releasing funk tracks beginning with its first album in 1967, culminating in the classic single "Express Yourself" in 1971. Also from the West Coast area, more specifically [[Oakland, California]], came the band [[Tower of Power]] (TOP), which formed in 1968. Their debut album ''[[East Bay Grease]]'', released 1970, is considered an important milestone in funk. Throughout the 1970s, TOP had many hits, and the band helped to make funk music a successful genre, with a broader audience.

In 1970, [[Sly & the Family Stone]]'s "[[Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin)]]" reached #1 on the charts, as did "[[Family Affair (Sly & the Family Stone song)|Family Affair]]" in 1971.  Notably, these afforded the group and the genre crossover success and greater recognition, yet such success escaped comparatively talented and moderately popular funk band peers. [[The Meters]] defined funk in [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]], starting with their top ten R&B hits "Sophisticated Cissy" and "[[Cissy Strut]]" in 1969. Another group who defined funk around this time were [[the Isley Brothers]], whose funky 1969 #1 R&B hit, "[[It's Your Thing]]", signaled a breakthrough in African-American music, bridging the gaps of the jazzy sounds of Brown, the [[psychedelic rock]] of [[Jimi Hendrix]], and the upbeat soul of Sly & the Family Stone and [[Mother's Finest]]. [[The Temptations]], who had previously helped to define the "[[Motown]] Sound" – a distinct blend of pop-soul – adopted this new [[psychedelic soul|psychedelic]] sound towards the end of the 1960s as well. Their producer, [[Norman Whitfield]], became an innovator in the field of psychedelic soul, creating hits with a newer, funkier sound for many [[Motown]] acts, including "[[War (Edwin Star song)|War]]" by [[Edwin Starr]], "[[Smiling Faces Sometimes]]" by [[the Undisputed Truth]] and "[[Papa Was A Rollin' Stone]]" by the Temptations. Motown producers [[Frank Wilson (musician)|Frank Wilson]] ("[[Keep on Truckin' (song)|Keep On Truckin']]") and [[Hal Davis]] ("[[Dancing Machine]]") followed suit. [[Stevie Wonder]] and [[Marvin Gaye]] also adopted funk beats for some of their biggest hits in the 1970s, such as "[[Superstition (song)|Superstition]]" and "[[You Haven't Done Nothin']]", and "[[I Want You (Marvin Gaye song)|I Want You]]" and "[[Got To Give It Up]]", respectively.

=== 1970s ===
{{see also|Disco}}

[[File:Stone3.jpg|thumb|[[The Original Family Stone]] live, 2006. Jerry Martini, Rose Stone, and Cynthia Robinson]]

The 1970s were the era of highest mainstream visibility for funk music. In addition to [[Parliament Funkadelic]], artists like [[Sly and the Family Stone]], [[Rufus & Chaka Khan]], [[Bootsy's Rubber Band]], the [[Isley Brothers]], [[Ohio Players]], [[Con Funk Shun]], [[Kool and the Gang]], [[the Bar-Kays]], [[Commodores]], [[Roy Ayers]], and [[Stevie Wonder]], among others, were successful in getting radio play. [[Disco]] music owed a great deal to funk. Many early disco songs and performers came directly from funk-oriented backgrounds. Some disco music hits, such as all of [[Barry White]]'s hits, "[[Kung Fu Fighting]]" by [[Biddu]] and [[Carl Douglas]], [[Donna Summer]]'s "[[Love to Love You Baby (song)|Love To Love You Baby]]", [[Diana Ross]]' "[[Love Hangover]]", [[KC and the Sunshine Band]]'s "[[I'm Your Boogie Man]]", "[[I'm Every Woman]]" by [[Chaka Khan]] (also known as the Queen of Funk), and [[Chic (band)|Chic]]'s "Le Freak" conspicuously include riffs and rhythms derived from funk.  In 1976, [[Rose Royce]] scored a number-one hit with a purely dance-funk record, "[[Car Wash (song)|Car Wash]]". Even with the arrival of disco, funk became increasingly popular well into the early 1980s.

Funk music was also exported to Africa, and it melded with African singing and rhythms to form [[Afrobeat]]. Nigerian musician [[Fela Kuti]], who was heavily influenced by James Brown's music, is credited with creating the style and terming it "Afrobeat".

=== Jazz funk ===
{{Main|Jazz-funk}}
Jazz-funk is a subgenre of [[jazz]] music characterized by a strong [[beat (music)|back beat]] ([[Groove (music)|groove]]), electrified sounds<ref>[http://www.rhapsody.com/jazz/jazzfunk/more.html ]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929083925/http://www.rhapsody.com/jazz/jazzfunk/more.html |date=September 29, 2007 }}</ref> and an early prevalence of [[analog synthesizers]].  The integration of funk, [[soul music|soul]], and [[rhythm and blues|R&B]] music and styles into jazz resulted in the creation of a genre whose spectrum is quite wide and ranges from strong [[Musical improvisation#Jazz improvisation|jazz improvisation]] to soul, funk or disco with jazz arrangements, jazz [[riff]]s, and jazz solos, and sometimes soul vocals.<ref name=allmusic>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/genre/jazz-ma0000002674 |title=Jazz &#124; Significant Albums, Artists and Songs |website=[[AllMusic]] |date=2013-11-24 |accessdate=2015-06-03}}</ref> Jazz-funk is primarily an [[United States|American]] genre, where it was popular throughout the 1970s and the early 1980s, but it also achieved noted appeal on the club-circuit in England during the mid-1970s. Similar genres include [[soul jazz]] and [[jazz fusion]], but neither entirely overlap with jazz-funk. Notably jazz-funk is less vocal, more arranged and featured more improvisation than soul jazz, and retains a strong feel of groove and R&B versus some of the jazz fusion production.

==== ''Headhunters'' ====
In the 1970s, at the same time that jazz musicians began to explore blending jazz with rock to create [[jazz fusion]], major jazz performers began to experiment with funk. Jazz-funk recordings typically used [[electric bass]] and [[electric piano]] in the rhythm section, in place of the double bass and acoustic piano that were typically used in jazz up till that point. Pianist and [[bandleader]] [[Herbie Hancock]] was the first of many big jazz artists who embraced funk during the decade. Hancock's [[The Headhunters|Headhunters]] band (1973) played the jazz-funk style. The Headhunters' lineup and instrumentation, retaining only [[Wind instrument|wind]] player [[Bennie Maupin]] from Hancock's previous sextet, reflected his new musical direction. He used percussionist [[Bill Summers (musician)|Bill Summers]] in addition to a drummer. Summers blended African, Afro-Cuban, and Afro-Brazilian instruments and rhythms into Hancock's jazzy funk sound.

==== ''On the Corner'' ====
''[[On the Corner]]'' (1972) was jazz trumpeter-composer [[Miles Davis]]<ref>http://www.allmusic.com/artist/miles-davis-mn0000423829</ref>'s seminal foray into jazz-funk. Like his previous works though, ''On the Corner'' was experimental. Davis stated that ''On the Corner'' was an attempt at reconnecting with the young [[African American|black]] audience which had largely forsaken jazz for [[rock and roll|rock]] and funk. While there is a discernible funk influence in the [[timbre]]s of the instruments employed, other tonal and rhythmic textures, such as the Indian [[tanpura]] and [[tabla]]s, and Cuban [[conga]]s and bongos, create a multi-layered soundscape. From a musical standpoint, the album was a culmination of sorts of the [[sound recording|recording studio]]-based ''[[musique concrète]]'' approach that Davis and [[Record producer|producer]] [[Teo Macero]] (who had studied with [[Otto Luening]] at [[Columbia University]]'s [[Computer Music Center]]) had begun to explore in the late 1960s. Both sides of the record featured heavy funk drum and bass grooves, with the melodic parts snipped from hours of jams and mixed in the studio.

Also cited as musical influences on the album by Davis were the contemporary composer [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]].<ref>"Miles Davis first heard Stockhausen's music in 1972, and its impact can be felt in Davis's 1972 recording ''On the Corner'', in which cross-cultural elements are mixed with found elements." Barry Bergstein "Miles Davis and Karlheinz Stockhausen: A Reciprocal Relationship." The Musical Quarterly 76, no. 4. (Winter): p. 503.</ref><ref>In Davis' autobiography he states that "I had always written in a circular way and through Stockhausen I could see that I didn't want to ever play again from eight bars to eight bars, because I never end songs: they just keep going on. Through Stockhausen I understood music as a process of elimination and addition" (''Miles'', New York: Simon & Schuster, 1989, p. 329)</ref>

=== 1980s synth-funk ===
{{see also|Electro music}}

In the 1980s, largely as a reaction against what was seen as the over-indulgence of [[disco]], many of the core elements that formed the foundation of the P-Funk formula began to be usurped by [[Electronic musical instrument|electronic instruments]], [[drum machine]]s and [[synthesizer]]s. Horn sections of saxophones and trumpets were replaced by [[Synthesizer|synth]] [[Electronic keyboard|keyboards]], and the horns that remained were given simplified lines, and few horn solos were given to soloists. The classic electric keyboards of funk, like the [[Hammond B3]] organ, the Hohner [[Clavinet]] and/or the [[Rhodes piano|Fender Rhodes piano]] began to be replaced by the new [[digital synthesizer]]s such as the  [[Sequential Circuits Prophet-5|Prophet-5]], [[Oberheim OB-X]], and [[Yamaha DX7]]. Electronic [[drum machines]] such as the [[Roland TR-808]], [[Linn LM-1]], and [[Oberheim DMX]] began to replace the "[[funky drummer]]s" of the past, and the [[Slapping (music)|slap]] and pop style of bass playing were often replaced by synth keyboard basslines. Lyrics of funk songs began to change from suggestive [[double entendre]]s to more graphic and sexually explicit content.

Influenced by [[Kraftwerk]], the Afroamerican rap DJ [[Afrika Bambaataa]] developed electro-funk, a minimalist machine-driven style of funk with his single "[[Planet Rock (song)|Planet Rock]]" in 1982.<ref> Planet Rock – The Album (Liner notes). Afrika Bambaataa & the Soul Sonic Force. Tommy Boy Records. 1986. TBLP 1007.</ref> Also known simply as electro, this style of funk was driven by synthesizers and the electronic rhythm of the [[TR-808]] drum machine.

[[Rick James]] was the first funk musician of the 1980s to assume the funk mantle dominated by P-Funk in the 1970s. His 1981 album ''[[Street Songs (album)|Street Songs]]'', with the singles "Give It to Me Baby" and "[[Super Freak]]", resulted in James becoming a star, and paved the way for the future direction of explicitness in funk.

[[File:Prince by jimieye.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Prince (musician)|Prince]] was an influential multi-instrumentalist, bandleader, singer and songwriter.]]

Beginning in the late 1970s, [[Prince (musician)|Prince]] used a stripped-down, dynamic instrumentation similar to James. However, Prince went on to have as much of an impact on the sound of funk as any one artist since Brown; he combined eroticism, technology, an increasing musical complexity, and an outrageous image and stage show to ultimately create music as ambitious and imaginative as P-Funk{{citation needed|date=September 2020}}. Prince formed [[The Time (band)|the Time]], originally conceived as an opening act for him and based on his "[[Minneapolis sound]]", a hybrid mixture of funk, [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]], [[Rock music|rock]], [[Pop music|pop]] & [[New wave music|new wave]].  Eventually, the band went on to define their own style of stripped-down funk based on tight musicianship and sexual themes.

Similar to Prince, other bands emerged during the P-Funk era and began to incorporate uninhibited sexuality, dance-oriented themes, [[synthesizer]]s and other electronic technologies to continue to craft funk hits. These included [[Cameo (band)|Cameo]], [[Zapp (band)|Zapp]], the [[Gap Band]], the [[Bar-Kays]], and the [[Dazz Band]], who all found their biggest hits in the early 1980s. By the latter half of the 1980s, pure funk had lost its commercial impact; however, pop artists from [[Michael Jackson]] to Culture Club often used funk beats.

=== Late 1980s to 2000s nu-funk ===
While funk was all but driven from the radio by slick commercial [[hip hop music|hip hop]], [[contemporary R&B]] and [[new jack swing]], its influence continued to spread. Artists like Steve Arrington and Cameo still received major airplay and had huge global followings.  Rock bands began copying elements of funk to their sound, creating new combinations of "[[funk rock]]" and "[[funk metal]]". [[Extreme (band)|Extreme]], [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]], [[Living Colour]], [[Jane's Addiction]], [[Prince (musician)|Prince]], [[Primus (band)|Primus]], [[Urban Dance Squad]], [[Fishbone]], [[Faith No More]], [[Rage Against the Machine]], [[Infectious Grooves]], and [[Incubus (band)|Incubus]] spread the approach and styles garnered from funk pioneers to new audiences in the mid-to-late 1980s and the 1990s. These bands later inspired the underground mid-1990s funkcore movement and current funk-inspired artists like [[Outkast]], [[Malina Moye]], [[Van Hunt]], and [[Gnarls Barkley]].

In the 1990s, artists like [[Me'shell Ndegeocello]], [[Brooklyn Funk Essentials]] and the (predominantly UK-based) [[acid jazz]] movement including artists and bands such as [[Jamiroquai]], [[Incognito (band)|Incognito]], [[Galliano (band)|Galliano]], [[Omar Lye-Fook|Omar]], [[Los Tetas]] and the [[Brand New Heavies]] carried on with strong elements of funk. However, they never came close to reaching the commercial success of funk in its heyday, with the exception of Jamiroquai whose album ''[[Travelling Without Moving]]'' sold about 11.5&nbsp;million units worldwide. Meanwhile, in Australia and New Zealand, bands playing the pub circuit, such as [[Supergroove]], [[Skunkhour]] and [[The Truth (Australian band)|the Truth]], preserved a more instrumental form of funk.

Since the late 1980s [[hip hop music|hip hop]] artists have regularly [[sampling (music)|sampled]] old funk tunes. [[James Brown (musician)|James Brown]] is said to be the most sampled artist in the history of hip hop, while [[P-Funk]] is the second most sampled artist; samples of old [[Parliament (band)|Parliament]] and [[Funkadelic]] songs formed the basis of [[West Coast rap|West Coast]] [[G-funk]].

Original beats that feature funk-styled bass or rhythm guitar riffs are also not uncommon. [[Dr. Dre]] (considered the progenitor of the G-funk genre) has freely acknowledged to being heavily influenced by George Clinton's psychedelia: "Back in the 70s that's all people were doing: getting high, wearing [[Afro]]s, bell-bottoms and listening to Parliament-Funkadelic. That's why I called my album ''[[The Chronic]]'' and based my music and the concepts like I did: because his shit was a big influence on my music. Very big".<ref>[http://www.musicstrands.com/artist/6599/biography Dr. Dre > Biography at MyStrands<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060220104429/http://www.musicstrands.com/artist/6599/biography |date=February 20, 2006 }}</ref> [[Digital Underground]] was a large contributor to the rebirth of funk in the 1990s by educating their listeners with knowledge about the history of funk and its artists. George Clinton branded Digital Underground as "[[Sons of the P]]", as their second full-length release is also titled. DU's first release, [[Sex Packets]], was full of funk samples, with the most widely known "[[The Humpty Dance]]" sampling Parliament's "Let's Play House". A very strong funk album of DU's was their 1996 release ''[[Future Rhythm]]''. Much of contemporary club dance music, drum and bass in particular has heavily sampled funk drum breaks.

Funk is a major element of certain artists identified with the [[jam band]] scene of the late 1990s and 2000s. [[Phish]] began playing funkier jams in their sets around 1996, and 1998's ''[[The Story of the Ghost]]'' was heavily influenced by funk. [[Medeski Martin & Wood]], [[Robert Randolph & the Family Band]], [[Galactic]], Widespread Panic, [[Jam Underground]], Diazpora, [[Soulive]], and [[Karl Denson's Tiny Universe]] all drew heavily from the funk tradition. [[Lettuce (band)|Lettuce]], a band of [[Berklee College Of Music]] graduates, was formed in the late 1990s as a pure-funk emergence was being felt through the jam band scene.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} Many members of the band including keyboardist Neal Evans went on to other projects such as [[Soulive]] or the Sam Kininger Band. [[Dumpstaphunk]] builds upon the New Orleans tradition of funk, with their gritty, low-ended grooves and soulful four-part vocals. Formed in 2003 to perform at the [[New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival]], the band features keyboardist [[Ivan Neville]] and guitarist Ian Neville of the famous Neville family, with two bass players and female funk drummer Nikki Glaspie (formerly of [[Beyoncé|Beyoncé Knowles]]'s world touring band, as well as the Sam Kininger Band), who joined the group in 2011.

Since the mid-1990s the nu-funk or funk revivalist scene, centered on the [[deep funk]] collectors scene, is producing new material influenced by the sounds of rare funk 45s. Labels include Desco, Soul Fire, [[Daptone Records|Daptone]], Timmion, Neapolitan, Bananarama, Kay-Dee, and Tramp. These labels often release on 45&nbsp;rpm records. Although specializing in music for rare funk DJs, there has been some crossover into the mainstream music industry, such as Sharon Jones' 2005 appearance on ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]''. Those with mix [[acid jazz]], [[acid house]], [[trip hop]], and other genres with funk include [[Tom Tom Club]],<ref>Walters, Barry.

Funk has also been incorporated into [[Contemporary R&B|modern R&B]] music by many female singers such as [[Beyoncé]] with her 2003 hit "[[Crazy in Love (Beyoncé song)|Crazy in Love]]" (which samples [[the Chi-Lites]]' "Are You My Woman"), [[Mariah Carey]] in 2005 with "[[Get Your Number]]" (which samples "[[Just an Illusion]]" by British band [[Imagination (band)|Imagination]]), [[Jennifer Lopez]] in 2005 with "[[Get Right (Jennifer Lopez song)|Get Right]]" (which samples [[Maceo Parker]]'s "[[Soul Power '74]]" horn sound), [[Amerie]] with her song "[[1 Thing]]" (which samples [[the Meters]]' "Oh, Calcutta!"), and also [[Tamar Braxton]] in 2013 with "[[The One (Tamar Braxton song)|The One]]" (which samples "[[Juicy Fruit (song)|Juicy Fruit]]" by [[Mtume]]).

===2010s punk laptronica===
During the 2000s and early 2010s, some [[Dance-punk|punk funk]] bands such as [[Out Hud]] and Mongolian MonkFish performed in the [[indie rock]] scene. Indie band [[Rilo Kiley]], in keeping with their tendency to explore a variety of rockish styles, incorporated funk into their song "[[The Moneymaker]]" on the album ''[[Under the Blacklight]]''. Prince, with his later albums, gave a rebirth to the funk sound with songs like "The Everlasting Now", "[[Musicology (song)|Musicology]]", "Ol' Skool Company", and "[[Black Sweat]]".

===2010s Low volume funk===
In the early to mid 2010s a new movment of funk music started to become popularised on the internet. Bands and artists such as [[Vulfpeck]], Scary Pockets, [[Knower]], [[The Fearless Flyers]] were recording live sessions of orginal or cover songs and publishing them as videos on Youtube as well as album formats.  The music tends to be characterised by lower volume and a minimalistic approach to funk.

== Derivatives ==
From the early 1970s onwards, funk has developed various subgenres. While George Clinton and the Parliament were making a harder variation of funk, bands such as [[Kool and the Gang]], [[Ohio Players]] and [[Earth, Wind and Fire]] were making disco-influenced funk music.<ref>Presence and pleasure: the funk grooves of James Brown and Parliament, p.4</ref>

Many instruments may be incorporated into funk rock, but the overall sound is defined by a definitive [[Bass guitar|bass]] or [[drum]] beat and [[electric guitar]]s.

===Go-go===
{{Main|Go-go}}
Go-go originated in the [[Washington, D.C.]] area with which it remains associated, along with other spots in the Mid-Atlantic. Inspired by singers such as [[Chuck Brown]], the "Godfather of Go-go", it is a blend of funk, [[rhythm and blues]], and early [[hip hop music|hip hop]], with a focus on lo-fi percussion instruments and in-person [[jam band|jamming]] in place of [[Sampling (music)|dance tracks]].  As such, it is primarily a dance music with an emphasis on live audience [[call and response]].  Go-go rhythms are also incorporated into street percussion.

=== Boogie ===
{{Main|Boogie (genre)}}
Boogie (or electro-funk) is an electronic music mainly influenced by funk and post-disco. The minimalist approach of boogie, consisting of synthesizers and keyboards, helped to establish electro and house music.  Boogie, unlike electro, emphasizes the slapping techniques of bass guitar but also bass synthesizers. Artists include [[Vicky D|Vicky "D"]], [[Komiko]], [[Peech Boys]], [[Kashif (musician)|Kashif]], and later [[Evelyn King (singer)|Evelyn King]].

=== Electro funk ===
{{Main|Electro funk}}
Electro funk is a hybrid of electronic music and funk. It essentially follows the same form as funk, and retains funk's characteristics, but is made entirely (or partially) with a use of electronic instruments such as the [[TR-808]]. [[Vocoder]]s or [[talkbox]]es were commonly implemented to transform the vocals. The pioneering electro band [[Zapp (band)|Zapp]] commonly used such instruments in their music. [[Bootsy Collins]] also began to incorporate a more electronic sound on [[What's Bootsy Doin'?|later solo albums]]. Other artists include [[Herbie Hancock]], [[Afrika Bambaataa]], [[Egyptian Lover]], [[Vaughan Mason & Crew]], [[Midnight Star]] and [[Cybotron (American band)|Cybotron]].

=== Funk metal ===
{{Main|Funk metal}}
Funk metal (sometimes typeset differently such as ''funk-metal'') is a [[fusion genre]] of [[music]] which emerged in the 1980s, as part of the [[alternative metal]] movement. It typically incorporates elements of funk and [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] (often [[thrash metal]]), and in some cases other styles, such as [[hardcore punk|punk]] and [[experimental rock|experimental]] music. It features hard-driving heavy metal [[guitar]] riffs, the pounding [[bass guitar|bass]] rhythms characteristic of funk, and sometimes [[hip hop music|hip hop]]-style [[rhyme]]s into an [[alternative rock]] approach to songwriting. A primary example is the all-African-American rock band [[Living Colour]], who have been said to be "funk-metal pioneers" by ''[[Rolling Stone]]''.<ref>{{cite web|last=Fricke|first=David|title=Living Colour – Collideoscope|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/livingcolour/albums/album/290616/review/6209668/collideoscope|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|accessdate=December 11, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090412062112/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/livingcolour/albums/album/290616/review/6209668/collideoscope|archivedate=April 12, 2009|date=November 13, 2003|quote=Black-funk-metal pioneers return in righteous form when black-rock warriors Living Colour broke up in 1995,}}</ref> During the late 1980s and early 1990s, the style was most prevalent in [[California]] – particularly [[Los Angeles]] and [[San Francisco]].<ref>{{cite journal |title=Primus: Nice and Cheesy |journal=Hot Metal |location=Sydney, Australia |last=Potter |first=Valerie |date=July 1991 |volume=29}}</ref><ref name="Spin Jan 91">{{cite journal |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z9fMwxwJ7tkC&pg=PA39 |page=39 |title=The Thrash-Funk scene proudly presents Primus |last1=Darzin |first1=Daina |last2=Spencer |first2=Lauren |journal=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]] |date=January 1991 |volume=6 |number=10}}</ref>

=== G-funk ===
{{Main|G-funk}}
[[File:Dr. Dre in 2011.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Dr. Dre (pictured in 2011) was one of the influential creators of G-funk.]]
G-funk is a [[fusion genre]] of music which combines [[gangsta rap]] and funk. It is generally considered to have been invented by West Coast rappers and made famous by [[Dr. Dre]]. It incorporates multi-layered and melodic synthesizers, slow hypnotic grooves, a deep bass, background female vocals, the extensive sampling of P-Funk tunes, and a high-pitched portamento saw wave synthesizer lead. Unlike other earlier rap acts that also utilized funk samples (such as [[EPMD]] and [[the Bomb Squad]]), G-funk often used fewer, unaltered samples per song.

=== Timba funk ===
{{Main|Timba}}
[[Timba]] is a form of funky Cuban popular dance music. By 1990, several Cuban bands had incorporated elements of funk and hip-hop into their arrangements, and expanded upon the instrumentation of the traditional conjunto with an American drum set, saxophones and a two-keyboard format. Timba bands like La Charanga Habanera or Bamboleo often have horns or other instruments playing short parts of tunes by [[Earth, Wind and Fire]], [[Kool and the Gang]] or other U.S. funk bands.  While many funk motifs exhibit a [[clave (rhythm)|clave]]-based structure, they are created intuitively, without a conscious intent of aligning the various parts to a [[bell pattern|guide-pattern]]. Timba incorporates funk motifs into an overt and intentional clave structure.

=== Funk jam ===
Funk jam is a [[fusion genre]] of music which emerged in the 1990s. It typically incorporates elements of funk and often exploratory guitar, along with extended cross genre improvisations; often including elements of [[jazz]], [[ambient music|ambient]], [[Electronic music|electronic]], [[Americana (music)|Americana]], and [[hip hop music|hip hop]] including improvised lyrics. [[Phish]], [[Soul Rebels Brass Band]], [[Galactic]], and [[Soulive]] are all examples of funk bands that play funk jam.

== Social impact ==
=== Women and funk ===
[[File:Chaka Khan in Chris March 01.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.75|[[Chaka Khan]] (born 1953) has been called the "Queen of Funk."]]
Despite funk's popularity in modern music, few people have examined the work of [[Women in music|funk women]]. Notable funk women include [[Chaka Khan]], [[Labelle]], [[Brides of Funkenstein]], [[Klymaxx]], [[Mother's Finest]], [[Lyn Collins]], [[Betty Davis]] and [[Teena Marie]]. As cultural critic Cheryl Keyes explains in her essay "She Was Too Black for Rock and Too Hard for Soul: (Re)discovering the Musical Career of Betty Mabry Davis," most of the scholarship around funk has focused on the cultural work of men. She states that "Betty Davis is an artist whose name has gone unheralded as a pioneer in the annals of funk and rock. Most writing on these musical genres has traditionally placed male artists like Jimi Hendrix, George Clinton (of Parliament-Funkadelic), and bassist Larry Graham as trendsetters in the shaping of a rock music sensibility."<ref>{{cite journal|author=Cheryl Keyes|title=She Was too Black for Rock and too hard for Soul: (Re)discovering the Musical Career of Betty Mabry Davis|date=2013|journal=American Studies|volume=52|issue=4|page=35|doi=10.1353/ams.2013.0107|s2cid=159486276|url=https://journals.ku.edu/amerstud/article/view/4476}}</ref>

In ''The Feminist Funk Power of Betty Davis and Renée Stout'', Nikki A. Greene<ref>{{cite journal|title=The Feminist Funk Power of Betty Davis and Renée Stout|author=Nikki A. Greene|journal=American Studies|volume=52|date=2013|issue=4|pages=57–76|doi=10.1353/ams.2013.0117|jstor=24589269|s2cid=143460406|url=http://journals.ku.edu/amerstud/article/view/4472}}</ref> notes that Davis' provocative and controversial style helped her rise to popularity in the 1970s as she focused on sexually motivated, self-empowered subject matter. Furthermore, this affected the young artist's ability to draw large audiences and commercial success. Greene also notes that Davis was never made an official spokesperson or champion for the civil rights and feminist movements of the time, although more recently{{when|date=October 2018}} her work has become a symbol of sexual liberation for women of color. Davis' song "If I'm In Luck I Just Might Get Picked Up", on her self-titled debut album, sparked controversy, and was banned by the Detroit [[NAACP]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:06zWC1pc6HIJ:https://journals.ku.edu/amsj/article/download/4472/4302/+&cd=7&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us|title=The Feminist Funk Power of Betty Davis and Renée Stout|website=webcache.googleusercontent.com|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref> Maureen Mahan, a musicologist and anthropologist, examines Davis' impact on the music industry and the American public in her article "They Say She's Different: Race, Gender, Genre, and the Liberated Black Femininity of Betty Davis.

Laina Dawes, the author of ''What Are You Doing Here: A Black Woman's Life and Liberation in Heavy Metal'', believes [[respectability politics]] is the reason artists like Davis do not get the same recognition as their male counterparts: "I blame what I call respectability politics as part of the reason the funk-rock some of the women from the '70s aren't better known. Despite the importance of their music and presence, many of the funk-rock females represented the aggressive behavior and sexuality that many people were not comfortable with."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ebony.com/entertainment/rise-of-the-funky-diva-999/|title=Rise of the Funky Divas|last=Gonzales|first=Michael A.|date=2016-07-22|website=EBONY|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref>

According to Francesca T. Royster, in [[Rickey Vincent]]'s book ''Funk: The Music, The People, and The Rhythm of The One'', he analyzes the impact of Labelle but only in limited sections. Royster criticizes Vincent's analysis of the group, stating: "It is a shame, then, that Vincent gives such minimal attention to Labelle's performances in his study. This reflects, unfortunately, a still consistent sexism that shapes the evaluation of funk music. In ''Funk'', Vincent's analysis of Labelle is brief—sharing a single paragraph with the Pointer Sisters in his three-page sub chapter, 'Funky Women.' He writes that while '[[Lady Marmalade]]' 'blew the lid off of the standards of sexual innuendo and skyrocketed the group's star status,' the band's 'glittery image slipped into the disco undertow and was ultimately wasted as the trio broke up in search of solo status" (Vincent, 1996, 192).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Royster|first=Francesca T.|date=2013|title=Labelle: Funk, Feminism, and the Politics of Flight and Fight|journal=American Studies|volume=52|issue=4|pages=77–98|doi=10.1353/ams.2013.0120|s2cid=143971031|issn=2153-6856|url=http://journals.ku.edu/amerstud/article/view/4474}}</ref> Many female artists who are considered to be in the genre of funk, also share songs in the [[disco]], [[Soul music|soul]], and [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] genres; Labelle falls into this category of women who are split among genres due to a critical view of music theory and the history of sexism in the United States.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1979/08/01/on-the-difference-between-funk-and-disco/25fcc5c6-1a13-4d64-9e99-a67dbd004b9a/|title=On the Difference Between Funk and Disco|date=August 1, 1979|work=The Washington Post|access-date=October 23, 2018}}</ref>

In recent years,{{when|date=October 2018}} artists like [[Janelle Monáe]] have opened the doors for more scholarship and analysis on the female impact on the funk music genre.{{dubious|reason=Monáe causes scholarship and analysis? Really? Are you really making that assertion in an encyclopedia article?|date=October 2018}} Monáe's style bends concepts of [[gender]], [[Human sexuality|sexuality]], and self-expression in a manner similar to the way some male pioneers in funk broke boundaries.<ref name=Valnes>{{Cite journal|last=Valnes|first=Matthew|date=September 2017|title=Janelle Monáe and Afro-Sonic Feminist Funk|journal=Journal of Popular Music Studies|volume=29|issue=3|pages=e12224|doi=10.1111/jpms.12224|issn=1524-2226}}</ref> Her albums center around [[Afrofuturism|Afro-futuristic]] concepts, centering on elements of female and black empowerment and visions of a [[dystopia]]n future.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.vox.com/2018/5/16/17318242/janelle-monae-science-fiction-influences-afrofuturism|title=Janelle Monáe's body of work is a masterpiece of modern science fiction|work=Vox|access-date=October 23, 2018}}</ref> In his article, "Janelle Monáe and Afro-sonic Feminist Funk", Matthew Valnes writes that Monae's involvement in the funk genre is juxtaposed with the traditional view of funk as a male-centered genre. Valnes acknowledges that funk is male-dominated, but provides insight to the societal circumstances that led to this situation.<ref name=Valnes/>{{clarify|reason=Please share some of that insight with our readers. This is an encyclopedia, not a book report.|date=October 2018}}

Monáe's influences include her mentor Prince, Funkadelic, [[Lauryn Hill]], and other funk and R&B artists, but according to Emily Lordi, "[Betty] Davis is seldom listed among Janelle Monáe's many influences, and certainly the younger singer's high-tech concepts, virtuosic performances, and meticulously produced songs are far removed from Davis's proto-punk aesthetic. But... like Davis, she also is closely linked with a visionary male mentor (Prince). The title of Monáe's 2013 album, ''The Electric Lady'', alludes to Hendrix's ''Electric Ladyland'', but it also implicitly cites the coterie of women that inspired Hendrix himself: that group, called the Cosmic Ladies or Electric Ladies, was together led by Hendrix's lover Devon Wilson and Betty Davis."<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-artful-erotic-and-still-misunderstood-funk-of-betty-davis|title=The Artful, Erotic, and Still Misunderstood Funk of Betty Davis|first=Emily|last=Lordi|date=May 2, 2018|work=The New Yorker|access-date=October 23, 2018}}</ref>
