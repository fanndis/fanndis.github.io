'''iTunes''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|aɪ|t|uː|n|z}})<ref>{{citation|last=Wells|first=John C.|year=2008|title=Longman Pronunciation Dictionary|edition=3rd|publisher=Longman|page=427|isbn=9781405881180}}</ref> is an American [[Media player (software)|media player]], media library, [[Internet radio]] broadcaster, [[mobile device]] management utility, and the client app for [[iTunes Store]], developed by [[Apple Inc.]] It is used to purchase, play, download, and organize digital multimedia, on personal computers running the [[macOS]] and [[Windows]] operating systems, and can be used to [[Ripping|rip]] songs from CDs, as well as play content with the use of dynamic, smart [[playlist]]s. Options for sound optimizations exist, as well as ways to wirelessly share the iTunes library.

Originally announced by CEO [[Steve Jobs]] on January 9, 2001, iTunes' original and main focus was music, with a library offering organization, collection, and storage of users' music collections. In 2005, however, Apple expanded on the core features with support for digital video, [[podcasts]], [[e-books]], and [[mobile apps]] purchased from [[App Store (iOS)|the iOS App Store]] (the last of which it discontinued in 2017). Until the release of [[iOS 5]] in 2011, all [[iPhone|iPhones]], [[iPod Touch|iPod Touches]] and [[iPad|iPads]] required iTunes for activation. Until the release of [[iOS 5]] in 2011, iTunes was required for updating mobile apps. Newer iOS devices have less reliance on iTunes in order to function, though it can still be used to back up the contents of mobile devices, as well as to share files with personal computers.

Though well-received in its early years, iTunes soon received increasingly significant criticism for a [[software bloat|bloated]] user experience, with Apple adopting an all-encompassing feature-set in iTunes rather than sticking to its original music-based purpose. On June 3, 2019, Apple announced that iTunes in [[macOS Catalina]] would be replaced by separate apps, namely [[Apple Music (software)|Music]], [[Podcasts (software)|Podcasts]], and [[Apple TV (software)|TV]]. [[Finder (software)|Finder]] would take over the device management capabilities.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/3/18647182/apple-itunes-podcasts-music-tv-mac-os-wwdc-2019|title=Apple breaks up iTunes, creates separate Podcasts, TV, and Music apps for macOS|last=Carman|first=Ashley|date=2019-06-03|website=The Verge|access-date=2019-06-03}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://variety.com/2019/digital/news/itunes-shutting-down-1203231598/|title=Apple Is Officially Killing iTunes, Replacing It With Three Dedicated Media Apps|last=Roettgers|first=Janko|date=2019-06-03|website=Variety|language=en|access-date=2019-06-03}}</ref> This change would not affect Windows or older macOS versions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://variety.com/2019/digital/news/apple-itunes-store-ios-windows-not-going-away-1203231814/|title=Apple’s iTunes Store, iTunes App for Windows Aren’t Going Away|last=Spangler|first=Todd|date=2019-06-03|website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|language=en|access-date=2019-06-03}}</ref> By the mid-2010s, [[streaming media]] services surpassed iTunes' buy-to-own model, starting to generate more revenue in the industry.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2019/digital/news/apple-shutting-down-itunes-era-1203230851/|title=Apple May Finally Shutter iTunes, But the iTunes Era Ended Long Ago|work=Variety}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/3/18650571/apple-itunes-rip-discontinued-macos-10-15-ipod-store-digital-music-wwdc-2019|title=The rise and fall of iTunes, Apple’s most hated app|work=The Verge}}</ref>

==Music library==
iTunes features a music library. Each track has attributes, called [[metadata]], that can be edited by the user, including changing the name of the artist, album, and genre, year of release, artwork, among other additional settings.<ref>{{cite web |first=Matt |last=Elliott |title=Clean up and organize your iTunes music library |url=https://www.cnet.com/how-to/clean-up-and-organize-your-itunes-music-library/ |website=[[CNET]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |date=April 30, 2014 |accessdate=December 16, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Dan |last=Miller |title=How I edit track metadata in iTunes |url=https://www.macworld.com/article/2097420/how-i-edit-track-metadata-in-itunes.html |website=[[Macworld]] |publisher=[[International Data Group]] |date=February 13, 2014 |accessdate=December 16, 2017}}</ref> The software supports importing digital audio tracks that can then be transferred to [[iOS]] devices,<ref>{{cite web |first=Sam |last=Costello |title=How to Import Downloaded Music to iTunes |url=https://www.lifewire.com/add-downloaded-mp3s-to-itunes-4103834 |website=[[Lifewire]] |publisher=[[Dotdash]] |date=October 4, 2017 |accessdate=December 16, 2017}}</ref> as well as supporting [[ripping]] content from CDs.<ref>{{cite web |first=Sam |last=Costello |title=Use iTunes to Copy CDs to Your iPhone or iPod |url=https://www.lifewire.com/copy-cd-to-ipod-iphone-with-itunes-1999496 |website=[[Lifewire]] |publisher=[[Dotdash]] |date=June 13, 2017 |accessdate=December 16, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Christopher |last=Breen |title=How to rip CDs with iTunes |url=https://www.macworld.com/article/1156861/software-graphics/howto-rip-cds.html |website=[[Macworld]] |publisher=[[International Data Group]] |date=January 12, 2011 |accessdate=December 16, 2017}}</ref> iTunes supports [[WAV]], [[AIFF]], [[Apple Lossless]], [[Advanced Audio Coding|AAC]], and [[MP3]] audio formats.<ref>{{cite web |first=Kirk |last=McElhearn |title=The complete guide to using iTunes with lossless audio |url=https://www.macworld.com/article/3053566/software/the-complete-guide-to-using-itunes-with-lossless-audio.html |website=[[Macworld]] |publisher=[[International Data Group]] |date=April 14, 2016 |accessdate=December 16, 2017}}</ref> It uses the [[Gracenote]] music database to provide track name listings for audio CDs. When users rip content from a CD, iTunes attempts to match songs to the Gracenote service.

"Smart playlists" are a set of playlists that can be set to automatically filter the library based on a customized list of selection criteria, much like a [[database]] query. Multiple criteria can be entered to manage the smart playlist.<ref>{{cite web |first=Bryan |last=Gardiner |title=Use Smart playlists to keep your iPhone filled with your newest music |url=https://www.wired.com/2013/09/itunes-smart-playlist/ |website=[[Wired (website)|Wired]] |publisher=[[Condé Nast]] |date=September 3, 2013 |accessdate=December 16, 2017}}</ref> Selection criteria examples include a genre like [[Christmas music]], songs that haven't been played recently, or songs the user has listened to the most in a time period.<ref>{{cite web |first=Gina |last=Trapani |title=Top 10 iTunes Smart Playlists |url=https://lifehacker.com/355743/top-10-itunes-smart-playlists |website=[[Lifehacker]] |publisher=[[Univision Communications]] |date=February 13, 2008 |accessdate=December 16, 2017}}</ref>

=== Artwork printing ===
To compensate for the "boring" design of standard CDs, iTunes can print custom-made [[jewel case]] inserts. After burning a CD from a playlist, one can select that playlist and bring up a dialog box with several print options, including different "Themes" of album artworks.<ref>{{cite web |first=Jim |last=Heid |title=Create CD Inserts in iTunes |url=https://www.macworld.com/article/1040086/software-graphics/digitalhubnov.html |website=[[Macworld]] |publisher=[[International Data Group]] |date=October 18, 2004 |accessdate=December 16, 2017}}</ref>

== Criticism ==
=== Security ===
''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'' reported in November 2011 that Apple had been aware of a [[security vulnerability]] since 2008 that would let unauthorized third parties install "updates" to users' iTunes software. Apple fixed the issue prior to the ''Telegraph''{{'}}s report, and told the media that "The security and privacy of our users is extremely important", though this was questioned by security researcher [[Brian Krebs]], who told the publication that "A prominent security researcher warned Apple about this dangerous vulnerability in mid-2008, yet the company waited more than 1,200 days to fix the flaw."<ref>{{cite web |first=Christopher |last=Williams |title=Apple iTunes flaw 'allowed government spying for 3 years' |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/apple/8912714/Apple-iTunes-flaw-allowed-government-spying-for-3-years.html |website=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |publisher=[[Telegraph Media Group]] |date=November 24, 2011 |accessdate=December 16, 2017}}</ref>

=== Software bloat ===
