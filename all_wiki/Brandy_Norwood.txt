'''Brandy Rayana Norwood''' (born February 11, 1979), better known by her [[mononymous person|mononym]] '''Brandy''', is an American singer, songwriter, record producer, actress and businesswoman.<ref name="btt">{{cite web|date=2009-12-09|first=Shaheem|last=Reid|title=Brandy Thanks Timbaland For Endorsing Her New Rap Career|work=[[MTV News]]|publisher=MTV.com|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1627932/20091209/brandy.jhtml|accessdate=2010-06-30}}</ref> Born into a musical family, Norwood was raised in [[Carson, California]], beginning her career as a [[backing vocalist]] for teen groups. After signing with [[Atlantic Records]] in 1993, she released her [[Brandy (album)|self-titled debut album]] the following year, which sold six million copies worldwide. In 1996, Norwood began starring in the [[UPN]] sitcom ''[[Moesha]]'' as the title character, which lasted six seasons and resulted in numerous other roles. She resumed her music career in 1998 with the wildly successful duet with fellow [[contemporary R&B|R&B]] contemporary [[Monica (singer)|Monica]], "[[The Boy Is Mine (song)|The Boy Is Mine]]", which went on to become one of the best selling female duets of all time. Her second album, ''[[Never Say Never (Brandy album)|Never Say Never]]'', featured two number one singles, and earned Norwood her first Grammy Award.

Throughout the 2000s, Norwood held a precarious position in the pop industry. In 2002, she starred in the reality series ''[[Brandy: Special Delivery]]'', documenting the birth of her daughter. Her third and fourth albums, ''[[Full Moon (Brandy album)|Full Moon]]'' (2002) and ''[[Afrodisiac (Brandy album)|Afrodisiac]]'' (2004), were released to critical success. She served as a judge on the [[America's Got Talent (season 1)|first season]] of ''[[America's Got Talent]]'' before being involved in a widely publicized car accident in 2006. After several lawsuits stemming from the accident, Norwood's fifth album, ''[[Human (Brandy album)|Human]]'' (2008), was released to commercial failure.

In the 2010s, Norwood received a critical and commercial resurgence. In 2010, she returned to television as a contestant on the [[Dancing with the Stars (American season 11)|eleventh season]] of ''[[Dancing with the Stars]]'' and starred in the reality series ''[[Brandy & Ray J: A Family Business]]''. In 2012, she became a series regular in the [[BET]] series ''[[The Game (American TV series)|The Game]]'', and released her sixth album ''[[Two Eleven]]'' to critical praise. In April 2015, Norwood made her [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] debut in the musical ''[[Chicago (musical)|Chicago]]''. She starred in and executive produced a sitcom titled ''[[Zoe Ever After]]'' on BET which premiered in January 2016. In July 2020, Norwood released her seventh studio album, ''[[B7 (album)|B7]]'' (her first project as an independent artist) to critical acclaim.<ref>{{cite web|first=Will|last=Lavin|url=https://www.nme.com/reviews/album/brandy-b7-album-review-2720284?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=brandy-b7-album-review |title=Brandy – 'B7' review: illustrious R&B star shares hard-won truths on forthright comeback record |date=August 3, 2020 |publisher=[[NME]] |accessdate=August 3, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://ratedrnb.com/2020/07/brandy-is-her-most-authentic-self-on-b7-album-review/|title=Brandy Is Her Most Authentic Self on 'B7': Album Review |first=Danielle|last=Brissett|work=RatedRnB|date=July 31, 2020|accessdate=August 4, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/brandy-interview-b7-cinderella-1036056/|title=With Her First Album in 8 Years, Brandy Finally Feels Free|first=Brittany|last=Spanos|work=Rolling Stone|date=July 31, 2020|accessdate=August 6, 2020}}</ref><ref name="idolator">{{cite web|first=Mike|last=Weiss|title=Brandy Drops 'B7', Rolls Out "Borderline" Video|work=[[Idolator (website)|Idolator]]|url=https://www.idolator.com/7913099/brandy-drops-b7-rolls-out-borderline-video?firefox=1|date=July 31, 2020|accessdate=August 1, 2020}}</ref>

During the early production stages of her debut album, Norwood was selected for a role in the short-lived [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] sitcom ''[[Thea (TV series)|Thea]]'', portraying the daughter of a single mother played by comedian [[Thea Vidale]].<ref name="vibe7"/> Initially broadcast to high ratings, the series' viewership dwindled and ended up running for only one season, but earned her a [[Young Artist Awards|Young Artists Award nomination for Outstanding Youth Ensemble]] alongside her co-stars.<ref name="afbn">{{cite web|title=Awards for Brandy Norwood|publisher=[[IMDb]]|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005275/awards|accessdate=2010-03-19}}</ref> Norwood recalled that she appreciated the cancellation of the show as she was unenthusiastic about acting at the time, and the taping caused scheduling conflicts with the recording of her album.

Whilst Norwood does not have [[bipolar disorder]], according to notes that the singer wrote to accompany the album, "Bye BiPolar" is a metaphor that she's using for her own love life and discussing the way that her mental health struggles have been exacerbated by toxic relationships. “People need to understand that it's very real and it's not something that you judge," she wrote. "We judge things and we don't have enough compassion. We don't have enough love, we don't have enough understanding. Sometimes I feel like we look at things as just something to talk about, as just news."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.distractify.com/p/is-brandy-bipolar|title=Brandy's New Song "Bye BiPolar" Is an Open Discussion of Mental Health|first=Joseph|last=Allen|work=Distractify|date=July 31, 2020|accessdate=August 4, 2020}}</ref> Norwood told the ''[[New York Post]]'': "I have not been diagnosed as bipolar [...] but I’ve had moments where trauma has caused me to not be myself, and I felt at a point that I could’ve experienced moments of that."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://nypost.com/2020/08/06/brandy-drops-a-dose-of-sultry-rb-on-comeback-lp-b7/|title=Brandy talks Kanye, Whitney and her first album in eight years|first=Chuck|last=Arnold|work=New York Post|date=August 6, 2020|accessdate=August 6, 2020}}</ref> In an interview with ''The Grio'', Norwood said, "I’ve dealt with depression in the most severe … like severe depression.

===Automobile collision===
On December 30, 2006, while driving on Los Angeles road [[Interstate 405 (California)|405 Freeway]],<ref name= tmz.com>{{cite web|url=https://www.tmz.com/2007/01/24/brandy-causes-fatal-car-crash/ |title= Brandy Tells Witness Fatal Crash Was Her Fault |website= TMZ.com |date=2007-01-24 |accessdate=2010-02-04}}</ref> Norwood struck a Toyota driven by 38-year-old Awatef Aboudihaj, who later died from her injuries at the L.A. [[Providence Holy Cross Medical Center|Holy Cross]]. Norwood was neither arrested nor charged with vehicular manslaughter due to insufficient evidence.<ref name= tmz.com />

Law enforcement officials reported that Norwood was driving her car at 65 miles per hour and did not notice that vehicles ahead of her had slowed considerably. Her vehicle then collided with the rear of Aboudihaj's, causing the Toyota to strike another vehicle before sliding sideways and impacting the center divider. As the Toyota came to a stop, it was hit by yet another vehicle.<ref>{{cite web| url= https://www.tmz.com/tag/brandy%20car%20accident/page/2/ |title=Brandy Car Accident |website= TMZ.com |accessdate= 2010-02-04 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090706014521/http://www.tmz.com/tag/brandy%20car%20accident/page/2 |archive-date=July 6, 2009 }}</ref>

However, a source in the [[California Highway Patrol]] later reported that Aboudihaj actually struck the car in front of her and then slammed on her brakes before Norwood made contact. The sudden stop caused Norwood to hit Aboudihaj's car.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tmz.com/2007/12/28/brandy-in-the-clear/ |title=Brandy in the Clear |website= TMZ.com |date=2007-12-28 |accessdate=2010-02-04}}</ref> As confirmed, [[toxicology]] reports showed that Aboudihaj had "slight traces" of [[marijuana]] in her system at the time of the crash.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tmz.com/2007/12/26/brandy-crash-dead-woman-at-fault/ |title=Brandy Crash – Dead Woman at Fault? |website= TMZ.com |date=2007-12-26 |accessdate=2010-02-04}}</ref>

In December 2007, Norwood's attorney Blair Berk stated that the Los Angeles City Attorney determined Norwood should not be charged with any "crime relating to the accident back in 2006."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tmz.com/2007/12/28/brandys-lawyer-to-chp-you-did-her-wrong/ |title=Brandy's Lawyer to CHP – You Did Her Wrong |website= TMZ.com |date=2007-12-28 |accessdate= 2010-02-04}}</ref> In May 2009, Norwood stated, "The whole experience did completely change my life, and I can say that I think I'm a better person from it. You know, I still don't understand all of it and why all of it happened, but I definitely have a heart, and my heart goes out to everyone involved.

Nevertheless, there have been multiple lawsuits filed against Norwood, all of which were ultimately settled out of court by her attorney Ed McPherson. Aboudihaj's parents filed a $50 million [[wrongful death]] lawsuit against Norwood. Filed on January 30, 2007,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tmz.com/2007/01/30/brandy-sued-for-wrongful-death/ |title=Brandy Sued for $50 Million |website= TMZ.com |date=2007-01-30 |accessdate=2010-02-04}}</ref> the lawsuit was initially set to go to trial in April 2009,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://omg.yahoo.com/news/brandy-fatal-car-crash-changed-my-life-forever/15518 |title=Brandy: Fatal Car Crash 'Changed My Life Forever' |website= Yahoo.com |accessdate=2010-02-04 }}{{dead link |date= November 2016 |bot= InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> but was eventually cancelled as Norwood had settled out of court with Aboudihaj's parents.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tmz.com/2009/11/13/brandy-settles-with-final-crash-victim/ |title=Brandy Settles with Final Crash Victim |website=TMZ.com |date=2009-11-13 |accessdate=2010-02-04}}</ref> Aboudihaj's husband also filed a lawsuit against Norwood, suing her for an undisclosed amount of financial relief to cover medical and funeral expenses, as well as legal costs and other damages.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tmz.com/2007/05/03/victims-husband-sues-brandy-over-fatal-crash/ |title=Victim's Husband Sues Brandy Over Fatal Crash |website= TMZ.com |date=2007-05-03 |accessdate=2010-02-04}}</ref> He rejected his part of a $1.2 million settlement offer in February 2009,<ref name= ReferenceB>{{cite web|url=https://www.tmz.com/2009/06/02/brandy-settles-fatal-car-crash-case/ |title=Brandy Settles Fatal Car Crash with Victim's Kids |website= TMZ.com |date=2009-06-02 |accessdate=2010-02-04}}</ref> but did settle in November of that year.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.eonline.com/news/brandy_settles_with_motorist_over_fatal/134244 |first= Josh| last= Grossberg| title= Brandy Settles With Motorist Over Fatal Crash| website= EOnline.com| date= July 15, 2009| access-date= December 6, 2016}}</ref> The couple's two children, who also filed a lawsuit against Norwood, received $300,000 each, according to court documents filed in L.A.

Brandy has said that her single "[[Right Here (Departed)]]" from her album ''Human'' was inspired from the events of the crash.

==Artistry==

===Voice and style===
Norwood is a lyric [[mezzo-soprano]], with a range spanning three octaves and five semitones.{{cn|date=November 2020}} Her voice has often been described as soft, raspy, and husky by music critics and Norwood herself.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://power98fm.cbslocal.com/2012/10/16/album-review-brandys-two-eleven/| title=Album Review Brandy's "Two Eleven"| work=Power98fm| date=October 16, 2012| accessdate=November 2, 2012| first=Jennifer| last=Hall| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141030115953/http://power98fm.cbslocal.com/2012/10/16/album-review-brandys-two-eleven/| archive-date=October 30, 2014| url-status=dead| df=mdy-all}}</ref> Music critic and ''[[Slant Magazine]]'' writer Andrew Chan describes Norwood's vocal tone as having "an unusual mix of warmth and cold, hard edges". He further describes her vocal quality, saying, "Like little else in pop-music singing, Brandy's subtle manipulation of timbre and texture rewards close listening. [...] Her main claim of technical virtuosity has always been her long, cascading riffs, a skill many R&B die-hards revere her for."<ref>{{cite web|date=2012-10-14|first=Andrew|last=Chan|title=Album Review – ''Two Eleven'' (2012)|work=Slant Magazine|publisher=SlantMagazine.com|url=https://www.slantmagazine.com/music/review/brandy-two-eleven/2889|accessdate=2012-11-26}}</ref> Norwood is also noted for her use of [[multitrack recording]] to create intricate vocal arrangements and layering. Terry Sawyer of ''[[PopMatters]]'' writes on this skill, remarking, "While it's been said that Brandy's voice isn't exactly a barn burner, it's not mentioned enough that she does more than enough with what she's got. She never leaves her voice hanging in spotlit scarcity, folding its variegated terracing, whispering out the lead track, shouting in the back-up, and piling each song with enough interlocking sounds to create the tightly packed illusion of vocal massiveness."<ref>{{cite web|date=2004-09-17|first=Terry|last=Sawyer|title=Album Review – ''Afrodisiac'' (2004)|work=PopMatters|publisher=PopMatter.com|url=https://www.popmatters.com/music/reviews/b/brandy-afrodisiac.shtml|accessdate=2010-06-30}}</ref>

Norwood's initial sound was [[contemporary R&B]], heavily rooted in [[Gospel music|gospel]] and [[hip hop soul]].<ref name="Brandy">{{cite web|title=Brandy|work=Mississippi Musicians & Writers|url=http://www.mswritersandmusicians.com/musicians/brandy-norwood.html|accessdate=2010-02-11}}</ref> Her lyrics spoke of various types of love, from casual and friendly love to romantic and spiritual affairs.<ref name="Brandy"/> Influenced by Houston and Carey, she incorporated [[adult Contemporary music|adult contemporary pop]] and an emphasis on smooth, mature R&B ballads into the sound for her second studio album ''[[Never Say Never (Brandy album)|Never Say Never]]''.<ref name="one"/> Her third studio album ''[[Full Moon (Brandy album)|Full Moon]]'' saw Norwood, and her then-creative partner [[Rodney Jerkins]], experiment with blending her previous R&B sounds with futuristic, forward-thinking productions, including influences of [[electro (music)|electro-funk]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Brandy Talks For A Minute Or Two{{nbsp}}...

Along with her style, her voice had gone through an evolution, with her light, girlish voice becoming much deeper, warmer, and smokier than it had been throughout the 1990s.<ref>{{cite news|date=2002-03-22|first=Craig|last=Seymour|title=Full Moon|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|url=https://ew.com/article/2002/03/22/full-moon/|accessdate=2010-06-11}}</ref> The lyrics also reflected the change, as the album explored more adult, sexual topics and focused on both physical and emotional aspects of an intimate relationship.<ref name="auto"/>
In 2004, her recent motherhood, life experiences, and growing affinity for British rock band [[Coldplay]], caused her to shift toward a more experimental vision her fourth studio album ''[[Afrodisiac (Brandy album)|Afrodisiac]]''. The album, a collaboration with producers [[Timbaland]] and [[Kanye West]], utilized the distinctive [[illbient]] aesthetic, which fuses [[ambient music|ambient pop]], [[dub music|dub]], and [[breakbeat]] soundscapes with progressive sampling methods.<ref>{{cite web|first=Shaheem|last=Reid|title=Brandy Gets Love From Kanye, Timbaland On New Album|work=[[MTV News]]|publisher=MTV.com|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1486701/20040429/brandy.jhtml|date=2004-04-29|accessdate=2010-06-30}}</ref> A four-year hiatus and a few life-changing occurrences caused Norwood to return to the music industry in late 2008 with ''[[Human (Brandy album)|Human]]'', her fifth studio album, which discussed topics of love, heartache and honesty.<ref>{{cite news|title=''Human'' Review|work=[[The Guardian]]|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/dec/05/urban-brandy-norwood-human | first=Alex | last=MacPherson | date=2008-12-05 | accessdate=2010-04-26 | location=London}}</ref> Experiencing a career and personal rejuvenation in 2012, Norwood was eager to scale back her previous album's pop style and return to R&B on her sixth studio album ''[[Two Eleven]]''.

===Influences===
Since the start of her career, Brandy has named [[Whitney Houston]] as her most prominent music and entertainment influence. Early in her career, she would often describe Houston as her “idol”, crediting her voice, music, and performances as critical to her, both personally and professionally. In a 2014 interview, Brandy stated that, “as a professional musician, I would say that Whitney Houston is the greatest voice of all time.”<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIONbL33lks|title=Brandy on Whitney Houston HSN Special|work=HSN|date=6 November 2012|accessdate=12 September 2017}}</ref> She elaborates, saying “She was always the idea for me. I wanted to be like her, sing like her, and do everything she was doing.”<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH8M5mWaCSk|title=Brandy remembers Whitney Houston: "She's definitely one of my Angels"|work=OWN|first=Oprah|last=Winfrey|date=3 August 2014|accessdate=12 September 2017}}</ref> Beginning in the late 1990s, Houston would evolve as a personal friend and mentor to Brandy, with Houston nicknaming herself as Norwood's “godmother”.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c90CWobR5Yw|title=Whitney & Brandy Behind the Scenes|work=ABC and The Wonderful World of Disney|date=2 November 1997|accessdate=12 September 2017}}</ref>
 
Brandy also names her father, vocal coach [[Willie Norwood]], as instrumental to her discovery and development as a musician. She exclaims that her dad “taught me everything that I know [about singing]”. About her dad, Brandy states: “I grew up singing in church with my dad, where he was the musical director and we sang gospel songs in a cappella almost exclusively. He bought me my first 4-track tape recorder. At first, I didn't like my own voice, but he encouraged me to embrace the unique qualities of my voice.”<ref name="Frank Silent">{{cite news|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCkxM5XDdM&list=PL1E3B8E9DE3EFDF10|title=TrueExclusives UpClose and Personal interview with Brandy|work=True Exclusives.com|author=Frank Silent|date=20 May 2010|accessdate=26 September 2017}}</ref>

While developing her own style and vocal sound, Brandy would credit gospel-jazz singer [[Kim Burrell]], [[new-age music|new age]] artist [[Enya]], and English singer-songwriter [[Sade (singer)|Sade]] as major influences. In speaking about them, she said, "...{{nbsp}}it was listening to those women, along with my own creative voice, that helped me to find my niche, my own sound."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gNQEuM_quw|title=US Superstar Brandy LIVE in the Hangout|work=The Google Hangout|author=YouTube|date=20 September 2013|accessdate=26 September 2017}}</ref><ref name="Frank Silent"/>
