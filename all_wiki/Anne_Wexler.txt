'''Anne Levy Wexler''' (February 10, 1930 &ndash; August 7, 2009) was an influential [[United States|American]] [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] political consultant, public policy advisor, and later the first woman to head a leading lobbying firm in Washington, D.C.

==Early life and education==
She was born as '''Anne Levy''' on February 10, 1930, in [[Manhattan]], the daughter of [[Leon Levy (architect)|Leon R. Levy]], a prominent architect who designed the [[New York Coliseum]]. Her first involvement in politics was ringing doorbells for [[Harry S. Truman]] as a history major at [[Skidmore College]].

She married [[ophthalmologist]] Richard Wexler two weeks after her 1951 graduation. As a housewife in [[Westport, Connecticut]], she described herself as having "all the Jewish princess stuff—a lovely home, a full-time maid, lots of vacations" before she started becoming involved in politics.<ref name=NYTObit>Martin, Douglas. [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/09/us/politics/09wexler.html "Anne Wexler, an Influential Political Operative and Lobbyist, Is Dead at 79"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', August 8, 2009. Accessed August 8, 2009.</ref>

==Political career==
In the 1960s, Wexler began her political career by serving on the Westport Zoning Board of Appeals and by helping John Fitzgerald organize a Congressional campaign against the pro-Vietnam war [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] incumbent [[Donald J. Irwin]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Martin|first=Douglas|title=Anne Wexler, an Influential Political Operative and Lobbyist, Is Dead at 79|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/09/us/politics/09wexler.html|accessdate=20 March 2012|newspaper=New York Times|date=8 August 2009}}</ref> She organized the Connecticut effort for [[Eugene McCarthy]]'s 1968 presidential campaign, and served on the rules committee at the [[1968 Democratic National Convention]] in [[Chicago]], where she was the primary author of the committee's minority report, whose recommendations on reforms in choosing delegates were later accepted.<ref name=NYTObit/>

She managed the 1970 [[United States Senate]] campaign in Connecticut for Democrat [[Joseph Duffey]], a Democrat who came in second to [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Lowell P. Weicker, Jr.]], with incumbent [[Thomas J. Dodd]] coming in third.<ref name=NYTObit/> [[Bill Clinton|Bill]] and [[Hillary Clinton]], then students at [[Yale Law School]], were recruited among the campaign's volunteer workers. (Mrs. Clinton, while running for President in 2008, credited Wexler with providing her first political job.)<ref name=WashPostObit/>

After a divorce from her first husband, in September 1974, Wexler married Duffey, who would later head the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] and the [[United States Information Agency]].<ref name=NYTObit/>

Working for [[Common Cause]] in 1971, Wexler headed a short-lived [[voting rights]] effort before directing the 1972 presidential campaign of Democrat [[Edmund Muskie]]. When Muskie dropped out of the race, she led a voter registration campaign for Democratic nominee [[George McGovern]], who was defeated by [[Richard Nixon]] in the general election.<ref name=NYTObit/>

''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine hired Wexler as an associate publisher in 1973, where her duties managing political reporting included overseeing the notoriously unconventional [[Gonzo journalism|Gonzo journalist]] [[Hunter S. Thompson]], who would sometimes stay at the Duffey-Wexler residence while in Washington, D.C.<ref name=NYTObit/>

===Carter Administration===
During the [[1976 United States presidential election|1976 Presidential Election]], Wexler worked for the [[Jimmy Carter]] campaign and served on his transition team after Carter's victory over [[Gerald Ford]]. Being responsible for screening candidates for top-level positions, she recommended the little-known [[Juanita M. Kreps]] as the first woman to become
[[United States Secretary of Commerce]]. Wexler herself then became Undersecretary of the [[United States Department of Commerce|Department of Commerce]].<ref name=NYTObit/>

Wexler later moved to the White House, succeeding [[Midge Costanza]] as Special Assistant to  President Carter for Public Outreach within the [[White House Office of Public Engagement and Intergovernmental Affairs]]. In that role, she set up meetings with the President with hundreds of business and opinion leaders, working to get their support for Carter's agenda as part of an effort she described as intended to "create lobbyists" by " educating people on the substance of the issues".<ref name=NYTObit/><ref>{{cite news|url=http://whitehousetransitionproject.org/resources/briefing/WHTP-2009-03-Public%20Liaison.pdf |title=White House Transition Project Institutional Memory Series: The White House Office of Public Liaison |page=4 |accessdate=2009-07-25 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728174855/http://whitehousetransitionproject.org/resources/briefing/WHTP-2009-03-Public%20Liaison.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-28 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1356&dat=19781211&id=4BsVAAAAIBAJ&pg=5264,3676088|publisher=[[Ocala Star-Banner]]|date=1978-12-11|title=Housewife on Carter's Senior Staff|author=Leslie Bennetts}}</ref> Assisted by her efforts, Carter was able to secure passage of the [[Torrijos-Carter Treaties]] that would lead to the end of U.S. control over the [[Panama Canal]], as well as deregulation of the airlines, trucking industry and newly found [[natural gas]].<ref name=NYTObit/>

Carter's [[White House Chief of Staff]] [[Hamilton Jordan]] described her in 1978 as "the most competent woman in Democratic politics in this country".<ref name=NYTObit/>

==Lobbying==
Immediately after the Carter Administration ended with the election of Ronald Reagan to the Presidency in 1980, Wexler established what would become one of the leading lobbying firms in Washington, Wexler & Walker Public Policy Associates,<ref name=NYTObit/><ref>{{cite news|url=http://thehill.com/business--lobby/top-lobbyists-hired-guns-2009-05-14.html|title=Top Lobbyists: Hired Guns|date=2009-05-14}}</ref>

Described by ''[[The Washington Post]]'' as "the first woman to own a lobbying firm", she later recalled her entry into a field that "was completely male dominated".<ref name=WashPostObit>Weil, Martin. [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/08/08/AR2009080800058.html?hpid=moreheadlines "Anne Wexler, Political Adviser and Lobbyist, Dies at 79"], ''[[The Washington Post]]'', August 8, 2009. Accessed August 9, 2009.</ref> She ensured that the firm had a bipartisan base, bringing in [[Ronald Reagan]] friend [[Nancy Clark Reynolds]] and hired former Republican Congressman (and [[Newt Gingrich]] ally) [[Robert Smith Walker]] of [[Pennsylvania]] after he left office in 1997.<ref name=NYTObit/>

The firm's clients included [[General Motors]] and the Government of [[Australia]], which honored her as an [[Officer of the Order of Australia]] for her meritorious service. Her firm was acquired by [[Hill & Knowlton]] in 1990, within which it operated independently.<ref name=NYTObit/>

Called the "[[Rolodex]] Queen" for the number and scope of her contacts, and lauded by ''[[Washingtonian (magazine)|Washingtonian]]'' magazine as "easily the most influential female lobbyist" in the capital, she credited her success to fulfilling the lobbyist's responsibility of guiding legislators through the pros and cons of complex legislation, a process that "government officials are not comfortable making... by themselves."<ref name=NYTObit/><ref>Staff. [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,960801,00.html "Peddling Influence"], ''[[Time (magazine)]]'', March 3, 1986. Accessed August 9, 2009.</ref>

==Death==
She died at the age of 79 on August 7, 2009, in her home in [[Washington, D.C.]] from cancer.<ref name=WashPostObit/> Wexler had [[breast cancer]] since being diagnosed in 1981.<ref name=WashPostObit2>Schudel, Matt. [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/08/08/AR2009080802128.html "Power Broker Founded First Major D.C. Lobbying Firm Led by a Woman"], ''[[The Washington Post]]'', August 9, 2009. Accessed August 9, 2009.</ref> She was survived by her second husband, Joseph Duffey; two sons from her first marriage, David and Daniel Wexler; stepsons, Michael and David Duffey; and four grandchildren. <ref name=WashPostObit/>
