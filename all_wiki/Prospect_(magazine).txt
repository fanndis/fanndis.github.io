'''''Prospect''''' is a monthly British general-interest magazine, specialising in politics, economics and current affairs. Topics covered include British, European, and US politics, social issues, art, literature, cinema, science, the media, history, philosophy, and psychology. ''Prospect'' features a mixture of lengthy analytic articles, first-person reportage, one-page columns, and shorter, quirky items.

The magazine was launched in October 1995 by [[David Goodhart]], then a senior correspondent for the ''[[Financial Times]]'' ''(FT)'', and chairman [[Derek Coombs]]. Goodhart came up with the idea of producing an essay-based monthly general-interest magazine—a form at that time unknown in Britain—while covering German reunification as [[Bonn]] correspondent for the ''FT''.

Some of the world’s leading intellectuals have featured in Prospect in the last few years, including Nobel prize-winning economists [[Joseph Stiglitz]], [[Amartya Sen]] and [[Angus Deaton]], world-renowned writers such as [[Lionel Shriver]], [[Clive James]], [[Toni Morrison]] and [[Margaret Atwood]], as well as scientists like [[Martin Rees]]. Notable features of the magazine include head-to-head debates between two writers with opposing views on a subject; roundtable discussions, in which a series of experts with varying views on a given topic meet for a discussion, an edited transcript of which is published in the magazine; and interviews with major political and cultural figures (examples include [[Orhan Pamuk]], [[Paul Wolfowitz]], and [[Hilary Mantel]]). 

''Prospect'' received worldwide attention in October 2005 when it published its list of the world's top 100 public intellectuals, which included [[Noam Chomsky]], [[Umberto Eco]], [[Richard Dawkins]], [[Steven Pinker]] and [[Christopher Hitchens]]. The magazine asked readers to vote for their top intellectual from the longlist; Chomsky was the eventual winner. Subsequent lists have continued to attract attention. Dawkins claimed the top spot in 2013. [[Amartya Sen]] won in 2014 and [[Thomas Piketty]] was the winner in 2015. After a four-year hiatus, the award was revived in 2019—the winner was the Kurdish mathematician [[Caucher Birkar]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/magazine/prospect-top-thinker-2019-winner-caucher-birkar|title=Top thinker Caucher Birkar talks maths, migration—and how his older brother taught him calculus|first=Tom|last=Clark}}</ref>

''Prospect'' has also published the winning [[short story]] of the [[Royal Society of Literature]]'s V. S. Pritchett Memorial Prize since 2009.

== Policy positions ==
The magazine features contributions from authors spanning the political spectrum. It tends to avoid a "line" on specific policy issues, claiming to offer a "[[contrarian]]" view and to be an "open minded" magazine.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/about |title=Prospect 'About Us' page |author=<!--Not stated--> |access-date=January 13, 2020 }}</ref> It has published articles debunking the "popular wisdom", on topics ranging from Japan's alleged economic crisis to the [[Mahdi army]] in Iraq.{{original research inline|date=January 2012}} However, it has been described as left-leaning by the BBC,<ref name="bbc">{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4733630.stm|title= 'Huge risks' of Cameron strategy|publisher=[[BBC News]] |author=[[Landale, James]] |date=February 20, 2006 |accessdate=May 8, 2019 }}</ref> and the ''Prospect'' contributor [[Roger Scruton]].<ref name="spectator">{{cite web|url=https://spectator.org/multiculturalism-r-i-p/ |title=Multiculturalism, R.I.P. |magazine=[[The American Spectator]] |author=Scruton, Roger |author-link=Roger Scruton |date=December 7, 2010 |accessdate=May 8, 2019 }}</ref>

In August 2009 in a roundtable interview in ''Prospect'', [[Adair Turner]] supported the idea of new global [[taxes on financial transactions]], warning that a "swollen" financial sector paying excessive salaries has grown too big for society. Turner's suggestion that a "[[Tobin tax]]", named after the economist [[James Tobin]], should be considered for [[financial transactions]] drew international attention.

Since 2004 the magazine's founding editor, [[David Goodhart]], has stirred controversy with a series of articles arguing that the increasing [[diversity of the United Kingdom]] may weaken the [[Equality and diversity (United Kingdom)|bonds of solidarity]] on which the welfare state depends. The debate fed into the broader discussions of "Britishness.{{Citation needed|date=June 2020}}

== The Think Tank Awards ==
''Prospect'' holds the annual [https://web.archive.org/web/20120626180350/http://www.thinktankawards.com/ Think Tank Awards], which celebrate and reward the work of [[think tank]]s on a national and global scale. The awards are supported by [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]]. Categories include "Global Think Tank of the Year", "Publication of the Year", "North American Think Tank of the Year", "European Think Tank of the Year" (excluding Britain), 'UK Think Tank of the Year', and many sub-categories for the UK.
According to the official website, "The awards are judged by a cross-party panel looking for evidence of influence on public policy and on the public discourse. The judges will also consider the quality of research and potential of younger and smaller organisations."
The awards have been running since 2001, and have been expanding exponentially to include more global awards for international Think Tanks. The winner of the most recent 2017 Think Tank awards (held at the [[Institute of Directors]] on 10 July) was the [[Joseph Rowntree Foundation]], based in the UK, for its "very strong analytical appraisal of social conditions in Britain".
