The '''Speaker of the Parliament of Singapore''' is the presiding officer of the [[Parliament of Singapore|Parliament of the Republic of Singapore]]. Currently, [[Tan Chuan-Jin]] is the incumbent Speaker of the Parliament of Singapore.

==Election==
Parliament must elect a Speaker at the beginning of each new parliamentary term after a [[Parliamentary elections in Singapore|general election]].<ref>Constitution, Art. 40(1).</ref> Parliament has the freedom to choose how to elect the Speaker. By recent tradition, the [[Prime Minister of Singapore|Prime Minister]] nominates a person for the role. The person's name is then proposed and seconded by the [[List of Singapore MPs|Members of Parliament]] (MPs), before being elected as Speaker.<ref name=ST20160108>{{cite news|last1=Lee|first1=Min Kok|title=Halimah Yacob to be renominated as Speaker of Parliament: 7 things you may not know about the post|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/politics/halimah-yacob-to-be-renominated-as-speaker-of-parliament-7-things-you-may-not-know-about|accessdate=7 August 2017|work=The Straits Times|date=8 January 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170807172539/http://www.straitstimes.com/politics/halimah-yacob-to-be-renominated-as-speaker-of-parliament-7-things-you-may-not-know-about|archivedate=7 August 2017|language=en}}</ref> The [[Constitution of Singapore|Constitution]] states that Parliament has the freedom to decide how to elect its Speaker.<ref name="Constitution, Art. 402">Constitution, Art. 40(2).</ref>

The Speaker may or may not be an elected MP, but must possess the qualifications to stand for election as an MP as provided for in the Constitution.<ref name=ParlSpeaker>{{cite web|title=Speaker of Parliament|url=https://www.parliament.gov.sg/about-us/structure/speaker-of-parliament|website=Parliament of Singapore|accessdate=7 August 2017}}</ref> The Speaker cannot be a Cabinet Minister or Parliamentary Secretary,<ref name="Constitution, Art. 402"/> and must resign from those positions prior to being elected as Speaker.

Once elected, a Speaker continues in office until the dissolution of Parliament, unless he or she resigns, is appointed as a Cabinet minister or Parliamentary Secretary, or is disqualified from holding their seat as an MP.<ref>Constitution, Art. 40(4).</ref>

==Role==
The role of the Speaker in Singapore is similar to that in most [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] legislatures. The Speaker presides over the sittings of Parliament, and enforces the rules prescribed in its Standing Orders for the orderly conduct of parliamentary business. In carrying out their duties, the Speaker must remain impartial and fair to all MPs.<ref name=ParlSpeaker/>

The Speaker regulates and enforces the rules of debate. They decide who has the right to speak, and put the question for Parliament to debate on and vote. The Speaker does not take part in the debates, but can abstain or vote for or against a motion if they have a vote as an elected MP.<ref name=ParlSpeaker/>

As the guardian of parliamentary privileges, MPs look to the Speaker for guidance on procedures, and for rulings on any [[point of order|points of order]].<ref name=ParlSpeaker/>

The Speaker is second in the [[order of succession]] for the office of the [[President of Singapore]]. Should the President's office be vacant, and the chairman of the [[Council of Presidential Advisers]] is unable to take up the role, the Speaker will assume the duties of the President until a new President is [[Presidential elections in Singapore|elected]].<ref>Constitution, Art. 22N.</ref> In terms of state protocol, the Speaker sits at the same level as the [[Chief Justice of Singapore]].<ref name=ST20160108/>

The Speaker acts as Parliament's representative in its relations with other legislatures and outside bodies. The Speaker also welcomes visiting dignitaries, and represents Parliament at national events and during official visits abroad. The Speaker is overall in charge of the administration of Parliament and its Secretariat.<ref name=ParlSpeaker/>

The Speaker is one of the few public sector roles which allow its office-holder to automatically qualify as a candidate in the Singapore presidential elections.<ref>Constitution of the Republic of Singapore, Art. 19(3)(a).</ref>

The incumbent speaker of parliament is [[Tan Chuan-Jin]] from the [[People's Action Party]].
