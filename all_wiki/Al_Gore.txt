'''Albert Arnold Gore Jr.''' (born March 31, 1948) is an American politician and [[environmentalist]] who served as the 45th [[vice president of the United States]] from 1993 to 2001. Gore was [[Bill Clinton]]'s running mate in their [[Bill Clinton presidential campaign, 1992|successful campaign in 1992]] and the pair were re-elected in 1996. Near the end of Clinton's second term, Gore was selected as the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] [[List of United States Democratic Party presidential tickets|nominee]] for the [[2000 United States presidential election|2000 presidential election]] but lost the election in a very close race after a [[Florida recount]]. After his term as vice-president ended in 2001, Gore remained prominent as an author and [[Environmental activism of Al Gore|environmental]] activist, whose work in [[Individual and political action on climate change|climate change activism]] earned him (jointly with the [[IPCC]]) the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 2007. In 2008, Gore won the [[Dan David Prize]] for Social Responsibility.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Al Gore, Israeli author Amos Oz win Dan David Prize|url=https://www.haaretz.com/1.4990452|access-date=2020-11-26|website=Haaretz.com|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Al Gore, Amos Oz share Dan David Prizes|url=https://www.jpost.com/israel/al-gore-amos-oz-share-dan-david-prizes|access-date=2020-11-26|website=The Jerusalem Post {{!}} JPost.com|language=en-US}}</ref> 

Gore was an elected official for 24 years. He was a [[United States House of Representatives|representative]] from [[Tennessee]] (1977–1985) and from 1985 to 1993 served as a [[United States Senate|senator]] from that state. He served as vice president during the [[Clinton administration]] from 1993 to 2001. The 2000 presidential election was one of the closest presidential races in history. Gore won the [[Direct election|popular vote]], but after a controversial election dispute over a Florida recount (settled by the [[U.S. Supreme Court]], which [[Bush v. Gore|ruled 5–4 in favor of Bush]]), he lost the election to Republican opponent [[George W. Bush]] in the [[United States Electoral College|Electoral College]].

==Harvard, the Vietnam War, journalism, and Vanderbilt (1965–76)==

===Harvard===
Gore enrolled in [[Harvard College]] in 1965; he initially planned to major in English and write novels but later decided to major in government.<ref name="Gore's Grades"/><ref name=harvardnyt/> On his second day on campus, he began campaigning for the [[freshman]] student government council and was elected its president.<ref name=harvardnyt/>

Gore was an avid reader who fell in love with scientific and mathematical theories,<ref name=harvardnyt/> but he did not do well in science classes and avoided taking math.<ref name="Gore's Grades"/> During his first two years, his grades placed him in the lower one-fifth of his class. During his [[sophomore]] year, he reportedly spent much of his time watching television, [[Cue sport|shooting pool]] and occasionally smoking [[marijuana]].<ref name="Gore's Grades"/><ref name=harvardnyt/> In his junior and senior years, he became more involved with his studies, earning As and Bs.<ref name="Gore's Grades"/> In his senior year, he took a class with oceanographer and global warming theorist [[Roger Revelle]], who sparked Gore's interest in global warming and other environmental issues.<ref name=harvardnyt/><ref>Turque, ''Inventing Al Gore'', p. 59.</ref> Gore earned an A on his thesis, "The Impact of Television on the Conduct of the Presidency, 1947–1969", and graduated with an [[Bachelors of Arts|A.B.]] ''[[cum laude]]'' in June 1969.<ref name="Gore's Grades"/><ref>Turque, ''Inventing Al Gore'', p. 388.</ref>

Gore was in college during the era of anti [[Vietnam War]] protests. He was against that war, but he disagreed with the tactics of the student [[protest movement]]. He thought that it was silly and juvenile to use a private university as a venue to vent anger at the war.<ref name=harvardnyt/> He and his friends did not participate in Harvard demonstrations. John Tyson, a former roommate, recalled that "We distrusted these movements a lot ... We were a pretty traditional bunch of guys, positive for civil rights and women's rights but formal, transformed by the social revolution to some extent but not buying into something we considered detrimental to our country."<ref name=harvardnyt/><ref name=frosh>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/campaigns/galleries/lifeofgore/photo8.htm|title=The Life of Al Gore, The Path to Politics|accessdate=June 28, 2010|date=December 31, 1999|work=[[The Washington Post]]}}</ref> Gore helped his father write an anti war address to the [[Democratic National Convention of 1968]] but stayed with his parents in their hotel room during the violent protests.<ref name=harvardnyt/>

When Gore graduated in 1969, he immediately became eligible for the [[Conscription in the United States|military draft]]. His father, a vocal anti Vietnam War critic, was facing a reelection in 1970. Gore eventually decided that enlisting in the Army would be the best course between serving his country, his personal values and interests. Although nearly all of his Harvard classmates avoided the draft and service in Vietnam,<ref name=serveornot>{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/pmextra/dec99/29/gore6.htm|title=Gore: To Serve or Not to Serve (The Life of Al Gore, Sixth in a series)|accessdate=June 29, 2010|author=Maraniss, David|author2=Nakashima, Ellen|date=December 29, 1999|work=The Washington Post|author-link=David Maraniss}}</ref> Gore believed if he found a way around military service, he would be handing an issue to his father's Republican opponent.<ref name=mixed/> According to Gore's Senate biography, "He appeared in uniform in his father's campaign commercials, one of which ended with his father advising: 'Son, always love your country'."<ref name=biosen>{{cite web|url=https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/resources/pdf/Gore,_Albert.pdf |title=Albert A.

After enlisting in August 1969, Gore returned to the anti war Harvard campus in his military uniform to say goodbye to his adviser and was "jeered" at by students.<ref name=pbschron/><ref name=harvardnyt/> He later said he was astonished by the "emotional field of negativity and disapproval and piercing glances that ... certainly felt like real hatred".<ref name=harvardnyt/>

Gore had basic training at [[Fort Dix]] from August to October, and then was assigned to be a journalist at [[Fort Rucker]], Alabama.<ref name=mixed/> In April 1970, he was named Rucker's "Soldier of the Month".<ref name=pbschron/>

His orders to be sent to Vietnam were "held up" for some time and the Gore family suspected that this was due to a fear by the [[Nixon administration]] that if something happened to him, his father would gain sympathy votes.<ref name=mixed/> He was finally shipped to [[South Vietnam|Vietnam]] on January 2, 1971, after his father had lost his seat in the Senate during the [[1970 United States Senate elections|1970 Senate election]], becoming one "of only about a dozen of the 1,115 Harvard graduates in the Class of '69 who went to Vietnam."<ref name=mixed/><ref name=boy/><ref name=father>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/05/22/us/a-political-father-who-chose-the-high-road-and-unpopular-stands.html|title=A Political Father Who Chose the High Road and Unpopular Stands|accessdate=June 29, 2010|author=Henneberger, Melinda|date=May 22, 2000|work=The New York Times}}</ref> Gore was stationed with the [[20th Engineer Brigade]] in [[Bien Hoa]] and was a journalist with ''The Castle Courier.''<ref name=cc>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/campaigns/galleries/lifeofgore/photo10.htm|title=The Life of Al Gore, The Path To Politics |accessdate=June 28, 2010|author=H.

[[File:1993 Clinton Inauguration.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The Clintons and the Gores as Chelsea Clinton rings a replica of the [[Liberty Bell]], 1993]]
Al Gore served as vice president during the [[Clinton Administration]].  Clinton and Gore were inaugurated on January 20, 1993. At the beginning of the first term, they developed a "two-page agreement outlining their relationship". Clinton committed himself to regular lunch meetings; he recognized Gore as a principal adviser on nominations and appointed some of Gore's chief advisers to key White House staff positions. Clinton involved Gore in decision-making to an unprecedented degree for a vice president. Through their weekly lunches and daily conversations, Gore became the president's "indisputable chief adviser".<ref name=biosen/>

However, Gore had to compete with First Lady Hillary for President Clinton's influence, starting when she was appointed to the health-care task force without Gore's consultation. ''Vanity Fair'' wrote that President Clinton's "failure to confide in his vice president was a telling sign of the real pecking order", and reported "it was an open secret that some of Hillary's advisers...nurtured dreams that Hillary, not Gore, would follow Bill in the presidency".<ref name="vanityfair.com">{{cite web |url=https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2007/11/clinton200711 |title=White House Civil War |work=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]] |accessdate=November 11, 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161007095712/http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2007/11/clinton200711 |archivedate=October 7, 2016 }}</ref><ref name="politico.com">{{cite news |first=Darren |last=Samuelsohn |url=http://www.politico.com/story/2015/11/al-gore-hillary-clinton-215957 |title=Why Al Gore won't endorse Hillary Clinton |accessdate=November 11, 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161204000204/http://www.politico.com/story/2015/11/al-gore-hillary-clinton-215957 |archivedate=December 4, 2016 }}</ref>

Gore had a particular interest in reducing "waste, fraud, and abuse in the federal government and advocated trimming the size of the bureaucracy and the number of regulations."<ref name=biosen/> During the Clinton Administration, the U.S. economy expanded, according to David Greenberg (professor of history and media studies at [[Rutgers University]]) who said that "by the end of the Clinton presidency, the numbers were uniformly impressive. Besides the record-high surpluses and the record-low poverty rates, the economy could boast the longest economic expansion in history; the lowest unemployment since the early 1970s; and the lowest poverty rates for single mothers, black Americans, and the aged."<ref name="econ">{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/history_lesson/2008/02/memo_to_obama_fans.html|title=Memo to Obama Fans: Clinton's presidency was not a failure|author=Greenberg, David|accessdate=August 14, 2013|work=The History Behind Current Events}}</ref>

According to Leslie Budd, author of ''E-economy: Rhetoric or Business Reality'', this economic success was due, in part, to Gore's continued role as an ''[[Atari Democrat]],'' promoting the development of [[information technology]], which led to the [[Dot-com bubble|dot-com boom]] (c. 1995–2001).<ref name=eeconomy>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KKk0jnq0W5YC&pg=PA126 |title=The puzzle of India's governance: culture, context and comparative theory|accessdate=July 10, 2010|author=Mitra, Subrata K.|date=January 13, 2006|work=|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-34861-4}}</ref> Clinton and Gore entered office planning to finance research that would "flood the economy with innovative goods and services, lifting the general level of prosperity and strengthening American industry."<ref name=hightech>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/11/10/science/clinton-to-promote-high-technology-with-gore-in-charge.html|first=William|last=Broad|title=Clinton to Promote High Technology, With Gore in Charge|date=November 10, 1992|work=The New York Times|accessdate=June 29, 2010}}</ref> Their overall aim was to fund the development of, "robotics, smart roads, biotechnology, machine tools, magnetic-levitation trains, fiber-optic communications and national computer networks.

During the election and his term as vice president, Gore popularized the term ''[[Information Superhighway]]'', which became synonymous with the [[Internet]], and he was involved in the creation of the [[National Information Infrastructure]].<ref name=hightech/> Gore first discussed his plans to emphasize information technology at [[UCLA]] on January 11, 1994, in a speech at [[The Superhighway Summit]]. On March 29, 1994, Gore made the inaugural keynote to a [[Georgetown University]] symposium on governmental reform{{efn |The annual Marver H.

During the 1990s, Gore spoke out on a number of issues. In a 1992 speech on the [[Gulf War]], Gore stated that he twice attempted to get the U.S. government to pull the plug on support to [[Saddam Hussein]], citing Hussein's use of poison gas, support of terrorism, and his burgeoning nuclear program, but was opposed both times by the Reagan and Bush administrations.<ref name=92speech2>{{cite web|url=https://www.c-span.org/video/?32824-1/clinton-campaign-event|title=Clinton Campaign Event|accessdate=June 22, 2008|author=Gore, Al|date=September 29, 1992|publisher=CSPAN}}</ref> In the wake of the [[Al-Anfal Campaign]], during which Hussein staged deadly mustard and nerve gas attacks on Kurdish Iraqis, Gore cosponsored the [[Prevention of Genocide Act of 1988]], which would have cut all assistance to Iraq.<ref name=92speech2/> The bill was defeated in part due to intense lobbying of Congress by the Reagan-Bush White House and a veto threat from President Reagan.<ref name=92speech2/> In 1998, at a conference of [[APEC]] hosted by [[Malaysia]], Gore objected to the indictment, arrest and jailing of Prime Minister [[Mahathir Mohamad]]'s longtime second-in-command [[Anwar Ibrahim]], a move which received a negative response from leaders there.<ref name=APEC>{{cite news|url=https://articles.latimes.com/1998/nov/18/news/mn-44145|title=Gore Gets Scolding From APEC, Business Leaders|accessdate=June 29, 2010|author=Drogin, Bob|date=November 18, 1998|work=collections}}</ref> Ten years later, Gore again protested when Ibrahim was arrested a second time,<ref name=summons/> a decision condemned by Malaysian foreign minister Datuk Seri Dr [[Rais Yatim]].<ref name=summons>{{cite web|url=http://us3.malaysia-today.net/2008/content/view/11057/84/|title=US State Department summons Malaysian envoy|accessdate=August 12, 2008|date=August 9, 2008|publisher=Malaysia Today|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080812012634/http://us3.malaysia-today.net/2008/content/view/11057/84/|archivedate=August 12, 2008}}</ref>

There was talk of a potential run in the [[2000 United States presidential election|2000 presidential race]] by Gore as early as January 1998.<ref name=wings>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/special_report/1998/clinton_scandal/51093.stm|title=Al Gore: Waiting in the wings|accessdate=June 30, 2010|author=BBC News staff|date=January 27, 1998|work=Clinton: Under Investigation|publisher=BBC}}</ref> Gore discussed the possibility of running during a March 9, 1999, interview with CNN's ''[[Late Edition with Wolf Blitzer]]''. In response to [[Wolf Blitzer]]'s question: "Why should Democrats, looking at the Democratic nomination process, support you instead of [[Bill Bradley]]", Gore responded:

Former UCLA professor of [[information studies]] [[Philip E.

Internet pioneers [[Vint Cerf]] and [[Bob Kahn]] stated that "we don't think, as some people have argued, that Gore intended to claim he 'invented' the Internet. Moreover, there is no question in our minds that while serving as Senator, Gore's initiatives had a significant and beneficial effect on the still-evolving Internet."<ref name=cerfkahn>{{cite web|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2000/10/02/net_builders_kahn_cerf_recognise/|title=Al Gore and the Internet|accessdate=June 30, 2010|author=Kahn, Robert|author2=Cerf, Vinton|date=October 2, 2000|work=The Register}}</ref><ref name=saloninternet/> Cerf would later state: "Al Gore had seen what happened with the [[Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956|National Interstate and Defense Highways Act of 1956]], which his father introduced as a military bill. It was very powerful. Housing went up, suburban boom happened, everybody became mobile. Al was attuned to the power of networking much more than any of his elective colleagues.

Honestly, at the time, when he said it, it didn't dawn on me that this was going to have the impact that it wound up having, because it was distorted to a certain degree and people said they took what he said, which was a carefully phrased comment about taking the initiative and creating the Internet to—I invented the Internet. And that was the sort of shorthand, the way his enemies projected it and it wound up being a devastating setback to him and it hurt him, as I'm sure he acknowledges to this very day."<ref name=blitzer>{{cite news|url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0807/06/le.01.html|title=CNN Late edition with Wolf Blitzer: 10th Anniversary Special|format=Transcript|accessdate=June 30, 2010|date=July 6, 2008|publisher=CNN}}</ref>

Gore himself would later poke fun at the controversy. In 2000, while on the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'' he read ''[[Top 10 list (David Letterman)|Letterman's Top 10 List]]'' (which for this show was called, "Top Ten Rejected Gore – [[Joe Lieberman|Lieberman]] Campaign Slogans") to the audience. Number nine on the list was: "Remember, America, I gave you the Internet, and I can take it away!"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2000/09/14/politics/main233560.shtml|title=Gore Does Dave|publisher=CBS News|date=September 14, 2000|accessdate=June 30, 2010}}</ref> In 2005 when Gore was awarded the ''Lifetime Achievement Award'' "for three decades of contributions to the Internet" at the ''[[List of Webby Award winners#2005|Webby Awards]]''<ref name=usatoday>{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/2005-05-04-gore-webby_x.htm|title=Webby Awards not laughing at Gore's contribution to Net Former Vice President of the United States|accessdate=June 30, 2010|agency=Associated Press|date=May 5, 2005|work=USA Today}}</ref><ref name=nyt>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/08/arts/08webb.html|title=Accepting a Webby?

He was introduced by Vint Cerf who used the same format to joke: "We all invented the Internet." Gore, who was then asked to add a few more words to his speech, stated: "It is time to reinvent the Internet for all of us to make it more robust and much more accessible and use it to reinvigorate our democracy."<ref name=nyt/>

During a speech that he gave on June 16, 1999, in [[Carthage, Tennessee]], Gore formally announced his candidacy for president. His major theme was the need to strengthen the American family.<ref name=announce2000>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/stories/1999/06/16/president.2000/gore/|title=Gore launches presidential campaign|accessdate=June 30, 2010|author=CNN staff|date=June 16, 1999|publisher=CNN}}</ref> He was introduced by his eldest daughter, [[Karenna Gore Schiff]].<ref name=announce2000/> In making the speech, Gore also distanced himself from Bill Clinton, who he stated had lied to him.<ref name=announce2000/> Gore was "briefly interrupted" by [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]] protesters claiming Gore was working with the pharmaceutical industry to prevent access to generic medicines for poor nations and chanting "Gore's greed kills."<ref name=announce2000/> Additional speeches were also interrupted by the protesters. Gore responded, "I love this country. I love the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] ... Let me say in response to those who may have chosen an inappropriate way to make their point, that actually the crisis of AIDS in Africa is one that should command the attention of people in the United States and around the world." Gore also issued a statement saying that he supported efforts to lower the cost of the AIDS drugs, provided that they "are done in a way consistent with international agreements."<ref name=protestAIDS>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/campaigns/wh2000/stories/gore061899.htm |title=AIDS Activists Badger Gore Again|accessdate=June 30, 2010|author=Babcock, Charles R.|author2=Connolly, Cici|date=June 18, 1999 |work=The Washington Post}}</ref><ref name=briefing>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/07/02/us/political-briefing-gore-is-followed-by-aids-protesters.html|title=Political Briefing; Gore Is Followed By AIDS Protesters|accessdate=June 30, 2010|author=Ayres, B.

While Bill Clinton's job-approval ratings were around 60%, an April 1999 study by the [[Pew Research Center]] for the People found that respondents suffered from "Clinton fatigue" where they were "tired of all the problems associated with the Clinton administration" including the Lewinsky scandal and impeachment. Texas Governor and likely Republican presidential nominee [[George W. Bush]] was leading Gore 54% to 41% in polls during that time. Gore's advisers believed that the "Lewinsky scandal and Bill's past womanizing...alienated independent voters—especially the [[soccer mom]]s, who stood for [[Social conservatism|traditional values]]". Consequently, Gore's presidential campaign "veered too far in differentiating himself from Bill and his record and had difficulty taking advantage of the Clinton administration's legitimate successes". In addition, Hillary's candidacy for the open Senate seat in New York exacerbated the "three-way tensions evident in the White House since 1993", as "not only was Hillary unavailable as a campaigner, she was poaching top Democratic fund-raisers and donors who would normally concentrate on the vice president". In one instance "Hillary insisted on being invited [to a Los Angeles fundraiser for the vice president]—over the objections of the event's organizers", where the First Lady "shocked the vice president's supporters by soliciting donations for herself in front of Tipper".<ref name="vanityfair.com"/>

Gore faced an early challenge by former New Jersey senator [[Bill Bradley]].<ref name=announce2000/> Bradley was the only candidate to oppose Gore and was considered a "fresh face" for the White House.<ref name=boyhoodhome>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/stories/1999/09/08/president.2000/bradley/|title=Bradley returns to boyhood home to launch fall campaign|accessdate=July 5, 2010|date=September 8, 1999|work=AllPolitics|publisher=CNN}}</ref><ref name=polls99>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/09/19/us/republicans-express-a-joint-fear-of-bradley-not-gore.html|title=Republicans Express a Joint Fear: Of Bradley, Not Gore|accessdate=June 30, 2010|author=Berke, Richard|date=September 19, 1999|work=The New York Times}}</ref> Gore challenged Bradley to a series of debates which took the form of "town hall" meetings.<ref name=townhall>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/10/20/us/bradley-accepts-gore-s-offer-and-7-debates-will-be-held.html|title=Bradley Accepts Gore's Offer, And 7 Debates Will Be Held|accessdate=June 30, 2010|author=Dao, James|date=October 20, 1999|work=The New York Times}}</ref> Gore went on the offensive during these debates leading to a drop in the polls for Bradley.<ref name=swing>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/campaigns/wh2000/stories/iowa101099.htm|title=Gore Takes Another Swing at Bradley|accessdate=June 30, 2010|author=Balz, Dan|author2=Connolly, Ceci|date=October 10, 1999|work=The Washington Post}}</ref><ref name=clock>{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/opinion/e1326.htm|title=Little time left on Bradley clock|accessdate=June 30, 2010|last=Benedetto|first=Richard|authorlink=Richard Benedetto|date=March 8, 2000|series=Opinion|work=USA Today}}</ref> In the Iowa caucus the unions pledged their support to Gore, despite Bradley spending heavily in that state, and Bradley was much embarrassed by his two to one defeat there.

The Florida recount was stopped a few weeks later by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]]. In the ruling, ''[[Bush v.

This 7–2 vote ruled that the standards the [[Florida Supreme Court]] provided for a recount were unconstitutional due to violations of the Equal Protection Clause of the [[Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]], and further ruled 5–4 that no constitutionally valid recount could be completed by the December 12 deadline.

===Criticism of Bush===
Beginning in 2002, Gore began to publicly criticize the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]]. In a September 23 speech that he gave before the [[Commonwealth Club of California]], Gore criticized Bush and Congress for the rush to war prior to the outbreak of hostilities in [[Iraq]]. He compared this decision to the [[Gulf War|Persian Gulf War]] (which Gore had voted for) stating, "Back in 1991, I was one of a handful of Democrats in the United States Senate to vote in favor of the resolution endorsing the Persian Gulf War ... But look at the differences between the resolution that was voted on in 1991 and the one this administration is proposing that the Congress vote on in 2002.

===Meeting with Ivanka and Donald Trump===
President [[Donald Trump]]'s daughter [[Ivanka Trump|Ivanka]] reported that she intended to make climate change one of her signature issues while her father served as President of the United States. She therefore contacted Al Gore, and he met with her and her father on December 5, 2016, at Trump Tower.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://insider.foxnews.com/2016/12/05/ivanka-trump-meets-al-gore-discuss-climate-issues |title=Ivanka Trump Meets with Al Gore to Discuss Climate Issues|website=Fox News Insider |date=December 5, 2016|accessdate=December 5, 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220230114/http://insider.foxnews.com/2016/12/05/ivanka-trump-meets-al-gore-discuss-climate-issues |archivedate=December 20, 2016 }}</ref> Following his visit, Gore spoke briefly to the media standing outside the elevator of Trump Tower. Gore related that: "I had a lengthy and very productive session with the president-elect. It was a sincere search for areas of common ground. I had a meeting beforehand with Ivanka Trump. The bulk of the time was with the president-elect, Donald Trump. I found it an extremely interesting conversation, and to be continued, and I'm just going to leave it at that."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/12/05/politics/ivanka-trump-al-gore-climate-change/ |title=Donald Trump meets with Al Gore on climate change |work=[[CNN]] |first=Tal |last=Kopan |date=December 5, 2016 |access-date=December 5, 2016}}</ref>
