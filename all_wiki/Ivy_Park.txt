==History==
Originally co-founded between Beyoncé and [[Sir Philip Green]], Ivy Park launched a [[joint venture]] with [[Topshop]] in October 2014, and operated under the company Parkwood Topshop Athletic Ltd.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vogue.co.uk/news/2014/10/27/beyonce-knowles-collaboration-topshop-athletic|title=CONFIRMED: Beyoncé And Topshop Launch Activewear|work=Vogue|first=Lauren|last=Milligan|date=October 27, 2014|accessdate=April 2, 2016}}</ref>Initially set for the fall of 2015, Ivy Park's launch was pushed back to the spring of 2016,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.harpersbazaar.com/fashion/trends/news/a13156/beyonce-athleisure-brand-topshop/|title=Beyoncé's Topshop Athleisure Brand Gets an Official Launch Date|work=[[Harper's Bazaar]]|first=Lauren|last=Fisher|date=November 30, 2015|accessdate=April 2, 2016}}</ref> with an April 14, 2016 official launch date to in-store and online retailers. 

On November 14, 2018, Parkwood Entertainment acquired total ownership of the Ivy Park brand away from co-founder Green following [[allegation]]s of [[sexual harassment]] and racial abuse.<ref>{{cite web |title=Beyoncé cuts ties with Philip Green|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-46220057 |website=BBC News |accessdate=November 15, 2018 |date=November 15, 2018}}</ref>

==Launch==
On March 31, 2016, Beyoncé officially launched the line by revealing two covers for the May issue of [[Elle (magazine)|''Elle'' magazine]]. The issue includes an in-depth interview where the star explains her objectives for the brand and its impact on women.<ref name="elle">{{Cite web|url=http://www.elle.com/fashion/news/a35244/beyonce-fashion-line-ivy-park-means/|title=This Is What Beyoncé's Fashion Line Ivy Park Means|date=2016-03-31|work=[[Elle (magazine)|Elle]]|access-date=2016-04-12}}</ref> She said that her goal with the line is to "push the boundaries of athletic wear and to support and inspire women who understand that beauty is more than your physical appearance".<ref name="wt" /> That same day, Beyoncé also released a promotional video, titled "Where is your park" that gives viewers a glimpse of her workout routine, samples of the clothing line and a narration explaining the origin and significance of the brand and its name: Ivy, representing her daughter [[Blue Ivy Carter]], and Park, representing [[Parkwood Park]] in [[Houston]] where Beyoncé used to go to exercise and find personal strength.<ref name="elle" /> She elaborated in the video:

<blockquote>I would wake up in the morning, and my dad would come knocking at my door, telling me it's time to go running. I remember wanting to stop, but I would push myself to keep going. It taught me discipline. And I would think about my dreams. I would think about the sacrifices my parents made for me. I would think about my little sister and how I was her hero. I would look at the beauty around me, the sun shining through the trees. I would keep breathing. There are things I'm still afraid of. When I have to conquer those things, I still go back to that park. Before I hit the stage, I go back to that park. When it was time for me to give birth, I went back to that park. The park became a [[wikt:state of mind|state of mind]]. The park became my strength. The park is what made me who I am. Where's your park?<ref name="elle" /></blockquote>

The sportswear line includes tops, bottoms, swimwear, and accessories that range from $30 to $200.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.vogue.com/13421769/beyonce-athleisure-ivy-park-activewear-collection-video-behind-the-scenes/|title=Beyoncé's New Activewear Line, Ivy Park, Has Arrived|last=Carlos|first=Marjon|work=Vogue|language=en-US|accessdate=2016-04-12}}</ref>

==Ivy Park x Adidas: Drop 1==
On April 4, 2019, Beyoncé announced a [[collaboration]] between Ivy Park and [[Adidas]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/beyonce-partners-adidas-athleisure-ivy-park-2019-4|title=Beyoncé is partnering with Adidas to create new shoes and apparel and relaunch athleisure brand Ivy Park|last=Taylor|first=Kate|website=Business Insider|access-date=2019-04-04}}</ref> It marked the relaunch of the Ivy Park brand after severing ties with retailer Topshop.

===Promotion===
A week before the official launch of the collaboration, Beyoncé sent various orange boxes to celebrities and fans promoting it.

===Reception===
Hours after the pre-sale launch and 6 minutes after the main launch on January 17, 2020, the collaboration officially sold out on Adidas' website,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/beyonc-s-ivy-park-x-adidas-collection-sells-out-instantly-online-twitter-despairs-news.101273.html|title=Beyoncé's Ivy Park x Adidas Collection Sells Out Instantly Online, Twitter Despairs|website=HotNewHipHop}}</ref> with the collection's popularity reportedly crashing the website multiple times.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://thatgrapejuice.net/2020/01/beyonces-adidas-ivy-park-collaboration-sells-out-worldwide/|title=Beyonce’s Adidas x Ivy Park Collaboration Sells Out Worldwide|website=ThatGrapeJuice.net}}</ref> The line was available in select Adidas stores worldwide, as well as [[Bloomingdale's]], [[Nordstrom]], [[Foot Locker]], and [[Finish Line, Inc.|Finish Line]] locations in the United States, on January 18, but also quickly sold out.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2020/01/17/adidas-beyonce-ivy-park-new-line/4508428002/|title=Beyoncé's Ivy Park line for adidas selling out online but available in select stores Saturday|first=Kelly|last=Tyko|website=USA TODAY}}</ref> Many fans expressed their frustration and blamed Adidas' virtual "waiting room" for with not being able to purchase any items because of the short time it took to sell out.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thesouthafrican.com/lifestyle/beyonces-ivy-park-x-adidas-collab-sells-out-in-hours/|title=Beyoncé’s Ivy Park X Adidas Collab sells out in hours|date=January 18, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/17/business/beyonce-ivy-park-adidas/index.html|title=Beyoncé's Ivy Park x Adidas' line drops online and sends the internet into a frenzy|first=Chauncey Alcorn CNN|last=Business|website=CNN}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.revolt.tv/news/2020/1/17/21071145/twitter-reacts-beyonce-ivy-park-adidas-pre-launch|title=Twitter reacts to Beyoncé’s Ivy Park x Adidas pre-launch|first=Tamantha|last=Gunn|date=January 17, 2020|website=REVOLT}}</ref>

Matt Powell, a senior footwear analyst at NPD Group, says Ivy Park x Adidas could eventually surpass sales of other Adidas collaborations, including [[Adidas Yeezy|Yeezy]] by [[Kanye West]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/16/adidas-is-banking-on-beyonce-for-growth-with-ivy-park-athleticwear-line-debut.html|title=Adidas is banking on Beyonce for growth with Ivy Park athletic wear line debut|first=Jessica|last=Golden|date=January 17, 2020|website=CNBC}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://finance.yahoo.com/news/beyonces-ivy-park-launch-could-boost-adidas-141832147.html|title=Why Beyoncé’s Ivy Park launch could boost Adidas more than Kanye West did with Yeezy's|website=finance.yahoo.com}}</ref>

==Ivy Park x Adidas: Drop 2==
On October 19, 2020, Beyoncé posted a cryptic image on her Instagram page, reading "This Is My Park" with the four-word caption "DRIP 2 October 30".

==Controversy==
In early May 2016, a front-page story of British newspaper ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' featured allegations that Ivy Park factories in [[Sri Lanka]] were exploiting their workers by paying them $6.17 a day, below what they claimed was the minimum daily wage. A representative of Ivy Park responded to the claims by saying, "Ivy Park has a rigorous ethical trading program. We are proud of our sustained efforts in terms of factory inspections and audits, and our teams worldwide work very closely with our suppliers and their factories to ensure compliance".<ref name="wt">{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/may/18/beyonce-brand-ivy-park-denies-sweatshop-allegation/|title=Beyonce brand Ivy Park denies sweatshop allegations|work=[[The Washington Times]]|first=Jessica|last=Chasmar|date=May 18, 2016|accessdate=June 14, 2016}}</ref><ref name="cbs">{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/beyonces-ivy-park-clothing-line-denies-sweatshop-allegations/|title=Beyonce's Ivy Park clothing line denies sweatshop allegations|publisher=[[CBS News]]|first=Andrea|last=Park|date=May 17, 2016|accessdate=June 14, 2016}}</ref> As analyzed by [[CBS News]], the minimum daily wage in Sri Lanka was $2.68, which meant that workers were making double the standard, disproving the allegations.<ref name="cbs" />

In early April 2019, after the launch of Ivy Park's collaborative line with Adidas, news broke that Beyoncé had reportedly "ended a potential partnership with [[Reebok]] because the pitch team lacked diversity."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/beyonce-reebok-meeting-diversity-espn-adidas-a8857386.html|title=Beyoncé Walked Out of a Meeting With Reebok Over a Lack of Diversity, Reports Say|publisher=[[Independent Magazine]]|date=April 6, 2019|accessdate=25 October 2020}}</ref> Nick DePaula of [[ESPN]] said that “She had a meeting at Reebok and they had a whole presentation of everything [...] and she kind of took a step back and said: ‘Is this the team that’ll be working on my product?’ [...] ‘Nobody in this room reflects my background, my skin colour, and where I’m from and what I want to do.”<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.oprahmag.com/entertainment/a27055246/beyonce-reebok-meeting-diversity/|title=Reebok Shuts Down Report That Beyoncé Walked Out of a Meeting with the Brand|date=April 5, 2019|accessdate=25 October 2020|publisher=[[The Oprah Magazine]]}}</ref> Reebok has since "vehemently denied" the claims, stating through a spokesperson that "The report that Beyoncé walked out of a meeting with Reebok due to lack of diversity is categorically false. Our discussions with Beyoncé and her team continued for several months after our initial meeting. We are disappointed that false information is being reported as fact."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/reebok-beyonce-adidas-diversity-representation_n_5ca79253e4b0dca0330108c2?ri18n=true&guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly9jb25zZW50LnlhaG9vLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAMAZnUfxsy4hppeBnrtaXfXS7vwYC2Qlj5eYwYfEeo-eu3wTa3KvpvnZq0EQn7JtsR1ql9fg5K7NoEsaw6aWJNXwwFf1sHXqhDDji9iWax94UuN9lyAdhs_fD3_cQpRw3STvNj2xp6niQVLpaONvDo6E_EBsvDiWOkSBPqobBBFb|title=Reebok Denies Rumors That Beyoncé Walked Out Of Meeting Over Lack Of Diversity|publisher=[[HuffPost]]|date=May 4, 2019|accessdate=26 October 2020}}</ref>
