'''Little Mix''' are a British [[girl group]] formed in 2011 of members [[Jade Thirlwall]], [[Perrie Edwards]], [[Leigh-Anne Pinnock]], and [[Jesy Nelson]] during the [[The X Factor (British series 8)|eighth series]] of the British version of ''[[The X Factor (British TV series)|The X Factor]]''. The first group to win the competition, they signed with [[Simon Cowell]]'s record label [[Syco Music]] and released a cover of [[Damien Rice]]'s "[[Cannonball (Damien Rice song)|Cannonball]]" as their winner's single, which debuted atop the [[UK Singles Chart]] upon release. The group are known for their strong vocals and signature harmonies, as well as their representative songs about female empowerment and unity.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/2020/4/1/21200239/little-mix-break-up-song-lm6-review|title=Little Mix is the best girl group in the world.

Being one of the most successful acts to emerge from ''The X Factor'', the group has since earned three more UK number-one singles: "[[Wings (Little Mix song)|Wings]]" in 2012, "[[Black Magic (song)|Black Magic]]" in 2015 and "[[Shout Out to My Ex]]" in 2016.

Notably, their fourth album, ''Glory Days'', became the longest-reigning girl group number one album since the Spice Girls' [[Spice (album)|debut album]] 20 years earlier, and the highest first week UK album sales for a girl band [[Spiceworld (album)|since 1997]].<ref name="officialcharts.com">{{cite web|title=Little Mix's Glory Days is the millennium's longest reigning girl group Number 1|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/little-mixs-glory-days-is-the-longest-reigning-girl-group-number-1-since-spice-girls-debut-20-years-ago__17770/|accessdate=30 May 2017}}</ref> Throughout their career, the group has sold over 50 million records worldwide, making them one of the [[List of best-selling girl groups|best-selling girl groups]] of all time.<ref>{{cite web|last=Sturges|first=Fiona|date=15 June 2019|title='Little Mix: 'How dare they accuse us of trying to be sexual!'|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/little-mix-interview-perrie-new-album-lm6-simon-cowell-piers-morgan-a8957431.html|accessdate=21 July 2019|work=[[The Independent]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/the-official-top-40-biggest-artist-albums-of-2015-revealed__13273/|title=The Official Top 40 Biggest Albums of 2015 revealed}}</ref>

==History==

===2011–2012: Formation and ''The X Factor''===
In 2011, Edwards, Thirlwall, Pinnock, and Nelson individually auditioned successfully as soloists for the [[The X Factor (British series 8)|eighth series]] of the UK version of ''[[The X Factor (British TV series)|The X Factor]]'' in front of judges [[Louis Walsh]], [[Gary Barlow]], [[Tulisa Contostavlos]] and [[Kelly Rowland]],<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/dec/19/x-factor-little-mix-cannonball | location=London | work=[[The Guardian]] | first=John | last=Plunkett | title=X Factor: Little Mix have lowest-selling winner's single since 2004 | date=19 December 2011}}</ref> but failed the first challenge of the "bootcamp" section.<ref name="hellomag">{{cite web|url=http://www.hellomagazine.com/celebrities/201112126765/little-mix-x-factor/ |title=Little Mix to earn £8 million after winning X Factor |work=Hello |date=12 December 2011 |accessdate=25 August 2013}}</ref> They were allowed another chance to compete when they were placed in two separate ensembles by the judges during the "group bootcamp" stage, with Edwards and Nelson in four-member group Faux Pas and Thirlwall and Pinnock in three-member group Orion.<ref name="hellomag"/><ref name="Bootcamp">{{Cite episode |title=Bootcamp 2 |series=The X Factor |series-link=The X Factor (British series 8) |network=ITV |station=ITV 1 |airdate=25 September 2011 |series-no=8 |number=9 }}</ref> Both groups failed to make it through to the next stage.

On 20 November 2011, Little Mix became the first girl group in the show's eight-year history to progress past the seventh live show. The previous longest-surviving girl groups were [[The Conway Sisters]] ([[The X Factor (British series 2)|series 2]]) and [[Hope (band)|Hope]] ([[The X Factor (British series 4)|series 4]]), who had both lasted until week 7. Through the remaining course of the competition the group generally received positive feedback. During the semi-final stage of the show, Little Mix performed [[The Supremes]]'s "[[You Keep Me Hangin' On]]" as well as [[Beyoncé]]'s hit "[[If I Were a Boy]]". Their performance of "You Keep Me Hangin' On" received mostly negative feedback from the judges with Walsh stating that they "lost their mojo" and Rowland telling the girl group she had seen them do "better vocal performances." Their second performance of the night, "If I Were a Boy", was generally acclaimed by the judges with Walsh telling them they have "amazing potential" and calling them the "next big girl band." Rowland also told them they could be "incredibly dynamic" and "change the world" when they find the strength within each other. The group advanced through to the final live shows along with [[Marcus Collins (singer)|Marcus Collins]] and [[Amelia Lily]] following the public vote.

On 11 December, Little Mix were announced as the winners, the first time a group had won the British version of the show and the second (of five) in the worldwide franchise (after [[Random (band)|Random]] on the [[The X Factor (Australian season 1)|first series of the Australian version]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://thewest.com.au/entertainment/tv/teen-duo-country-mum-battle-for-x-factor-ng-ya-132911|title=Teen, duo, country mum battle for X Factor|publisher=The West Australian|work=AAP|date=24 November 2015|accessdate=15 February 2017}}</ref> [[Alex & Sierra]] on the [[The X Factor (American season 3)|third series of the United States version]], [[Rak-Su]] on the [[The X Factor (British series 14)|fourteenth series of the British version]] and 4 Magic on the [[X Factor (Bulgarian season 5)|fifth series of the Bulgarian version]]).{{citation needed|date=December 2019}} Their winner's single was a cover of [[Damien Rice]]'s song "[[Cannonball (Little Mix song)|Cannonball]]", which was released via [[music download|digital download]] on 11 December 2011, and on [[CD single|CD]] on 14 December 2011.<ref name="Amazon Cannonball 2011">{{cite web|work=Amazon.com|title=Cannonball|year=2011|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Cannonball/dp/B006KVVS36/ref=sr_shvl_album_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1323644261&sr=301-1|accessdate=21 December 2011}}</ref><ref name="Hackford Jones 2011">{{cite web|author=Hackford Jones|title=X Factor Winners Little Mix Release Debut Single Cannonball|year=2011|url=http://www.hackfordjonespr.com/pages/posts/x-factor-winners-little-mix-release-debut-single-cannonball91.php|publisher=Hackford Jones PR|accessdate=21 December 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130326013202/http://www.hjpr.co.uk/|archive-date=26 March 2013}}</ref> ''The Xtra Factor: The Winner's Story'' was shown on ITV2 on 17 December 2011.<ref name="TVGuide 2011">{{cite web|title=The Xtra Factor: Winner's Story 2011|url=http://tvguide.co.uk/titlesearch.asp?title=The%20Xtra%20Factor:%20Winner's%20Story%202011&|work=[[TV Guide]]|accessdate=17 December 2011}}</ref> Their debut single topped the [[UK Singles Chart]] on 18 December 2011.<ref name="Music Week">{{cite web|author=Music Week|title=The Official UK Singles Chart [Week 50]|year=2011|url=http://www.musicweek.com/MusicWeekWeb/DisplayChart.aspx?menuname=promoCharts&pageName=&flag=1&year=2011&weekNo=50&chartid=2&chartname=The+Official+UK+Singles+Chart&paging=1&chartFamilyId=family-2&sectionHeader=Sales|publisher=Intent Media|accessdate=21 December 2011}}</ref> They made the Christmas number one spot on the [[Irish Singles Chart]], beating novelty songs by [[The Saw Doctors]] and [[Ryan Sheridan (musician)|Ryan Sheridan]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/ten/2011/1223/littlemix.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120107203918/http://www.rte.ie/ten/2011/1223/littlemix.html|archive-date=7 January 2012|title=Little Mix claim Irish Christmas No.1|date=23 December 2011|accessdate=23 December 2011|work=RTÉ Ten|publisher=[[Raidió Teilifís Éireann]]}}</ref>

In March 2014, Little Mix teamed up with BeatBullying, the largest anti-bullying organisation in Europe.

Pinnock said: "Myself and the girls have all experienced being bullied at some point in our life. When we see on Twitter that some of our fans are going through it now we find it so upsetting and that's the reason we feel so passionate about this campaign and the work that BeatBullying does."<ref name="Little Mix talk bullies">{{cite web | title=Little Mix talk bullies| url=http://www.sugarscape.com/main-topics/celebrities/1023074/little-mix-talk-bullies-and-ask-you-join-%E2%80%98-big-march%E2%80%99-online-help-th|date=2014|accessdate=14 January 2017}}</ref> In March 2014, Little Mix released a cover of [[Cameo (band)|Cameo]]'s single "Word Up!" as the official single for Sport Relief 2014.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/news/a544605/little-mix-to-release-2014-sport-relief-single-word-up.html |title=Little Mix to release 2014 Sport Relief single 'Word Up'|work=[[Digital Spy]] |access-date=11 October 2020}}</ref> The group also visited Liberia to witness the work paid for by the Sport Relief donations.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/little-mix-visit-liberia-sport-6532368.amp|title=Chart toppers Little Mix visit Liberia with Sport Relief|work=Chronicle Live|access-date=11 October 2020}}</ref> In 2019, Thirlwall and Pinnock climbed [[Mount Kilimanjaro]] for [[Comic Relief]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.digitalspy.com/showbiz/a26485561/little-mix-good-luck-message-jade-thirlwall-leigh-anne-pinnock-comic-relief/|title=Little Mix send luck to bandmates as they start Kilimanjaro climb|first=Dan|last=Seddon|date=23 February 2019|website=Digital Spy|accessdate=26 February 2019}}</ref>
