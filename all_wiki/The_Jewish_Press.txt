==Editorial policy==
''The Jewish Press'' is oriented toward the [[Modern Orthodox Judaism|Modern Orthodox Jewish]] community, covering Jewish news from [[New York City]], the [[United States]], and [[Israel]].<ref name=T93/> The newspaper describes itself as having a politically [[Conservatism|conservative]] viewpoint and editorial policy,<ref name="JP"/> and "politically incorrect long before the phrase was coined."<ref name=Founded/> 

In 1990, ultraconservative [[Catholicity|Catholic]] weekly ''[[The Wanderer (Roman Catholic newspaper)|The Wanderer]]'' reported about a notice posted in ''The Jewish Press'' [[Herem (censure)|excommunicating]] U.S. Representative [[Barney Frank]], seeking to affirm [[Excommunication (Catholic Church)|similar practice]] in the [[Catholic Church]]. It was later pointed out to them that the notice was posted by an outlier, and that Judaism lacked a centralized excommunication process. [[Abraham Hecht]], president of the [[Rabbinical Alliance of America]], said "If we were going to start excommunicating, we'd have a list as long as the New York telephone directory".<ref>{{cite newspaper  |newspaper=[[The New York Times]]
