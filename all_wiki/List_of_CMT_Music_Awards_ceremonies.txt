This is a '''list of [[CMT Music Awards]] ceremonies''' and the winners in each ceremony. The show began as the''' ''Music City News'' Awards''' in 1967. The award show partnered with [[The Nashville Network]] (TNN) in 1990 to become the '''TNN ''Music City News'' Country Awards'''. After ''Music City News'' ceased publication in 1999, ''[[Country Weekly]]'' assumed the role of presenting sponsor of the awards show in 2000. In 2001, the show began airing on [[Country Music Television|CMT]], where it was retooled and renamed to the '''CMT Flameworthy Video Music Awards''' in 2002. The name of the show was changed to '''CMT Music Awards''' in 2005.
