'''Leipzig University''' ({{lang-de|Universität Leipzig}}), in [[Leipzig]] in the [[Free State of Saxony]], [[Germany]], is one of the world's oldest [[University|universities]] and the [[List of universities in Germany#Universities by years of existence|second-oldest]] university (by consecutive years of existence) in Germany. The university was founded on 2 December 1409 by [[Frederick I, Elector of Saxony]] and his brother [[William II, Margrave of Meissen]], and originally comprised the four scholastic faculties. Since its inception, the university has engaged in teaching and research for over 600 years without interruption.

Famous alumni include [[Gottfried Wilhelm von Leibniz|Leibniz]], [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]], [[Leopold von Ranke]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[Robert Schumann]], [[Richard Wagner]], [[Tycho Brahe]], [[Georgius Agricola]], [[Angela Merkel]] and the nine [[Nobel laureates]] associated with the university.

== History ==
{{refimprove section|date=December 2011}}
[[File:Memorial stone to the foundation of Leipzig University, quadrangle of Wittenberg University.jpg|thumb|Memorial stone to the foundation of Leipzig University]]
=== Founding and development until 1900 ===
[[File:Leipzig - Universität.jpg|thumb|Leipzig University main building (1917). It was demolished by the socialist administration in 1968.]]
The university was modelled on the [[Charles University in Prague|University of Prague]], from which the German-speaking faculty members withdrew to Leipzig after the [[Jan Hus]] crisis and the [[Decree of Kutná Hora]]. The ''Alma mater Lipsiensis'' opened in 1409, after it had been officially endorsed by [[Pope Alexander V]] in his ''[[Bull of Acknowledgment]]'' on (9 September of that year). Its first rector was [[Johann von Münsterberg]]. From its foundation, the [[Paulinerkirche, Leipzig|Paulinerkirche]] served as the university church. After the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], the church and the monastery buildings were donated to the university in 1544. In order to secure independent and sustainable funding, the university was endowed with the lordship over nine villages east of [[Leipzig]] (university villages). It kept this status for nearly 400 years until land reforms were carried out in the 19th century. During the [[Decline and modernization of the Ottoman Empire|decline]] and [[dissolution of the Ottoman Empire]] in the 19th and first decade of 20th century together with some other German universities Leipzig University turned into one of the centers of higher education for state administrations and elites of newly independent [[Balkan]] states ([[United Principalities of Moldavia and Wallachia|Romania]], [[Kingdom of Greece|Greece]], [[Principality of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]] and [[Principality of Serbia|Serbia]]) educating over 5,500 students from the region in 1859–1909 period.<ref name="Balkans">{{cite book |last=Pippidi |first=Adrei |date=2010 |chapter=The Development of an Administrative Class in South-East Europe |pages=111–134|title=Ottomans Into Europeans: State and Institution-building in South Eastern Europe |editor1-last=Mungiu-Pippidi |editor1-first=Alina

As many European universities, the University of Leipzig was structured into colleges (''collegia'') responsible for organising accommodation and collegiate lecturing. Among the colleges of Leipzig were the Small College, the Large College, the {{ill|Red College|de|Rotes Kolleg}} (also known as the New College), the College of our Lady and the Pauliner-College. There were also private residential halls (''bursen'', see English 'bursaries'). The colleges had jurisdiction over their members. The college structure was abandoned later{{clarify timeframe|date=November 2018}} and today only the names survive.

During the first centuries, the university grew slowly and was a rather regional institution. This changed, however, during the 19th century when the university became a world-class institution of higher education and research.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} At the end of the 19th century, important scholars such as [[Bernhard Windscheid]] (one of the fathers of the German Civil Code) and [[Wilhelm Ostwald]] (viewed as a founder of modern [[physical chemistry]]) taught at Leipzig.
[[File:Rotes Kolleg Leipzig.jpg|thumb|Formerly organized as a [[collegiate university]], the Red College of Leipzig University was established in the 16th century.]]
Leipzig University was one of the first German universities to allow women to register as "guest students".<ref name="frau">{{cite book|title=Die deutsche Frauenbewegung 1843–1889 |date=1972 |publisher=Hain |location=Berlin |page=112 |edition=1 |editor-last1=Twellmann |editor-first1=Margrit |editor-last2=Abendroth |editor-first2=Wolfgang |language=de |chapter=Louise Otto Peters.

This was the year that the first woman in Germany obtained her JD, [[Johanna von Evreinov]].

Until the beginning of the [[Second World War]], Leipzig University attracted a number of renowned scholars and later [[Nobel Prize laureate]]s, including Paul Ehrlich, Felix Bloch, Werner Heisenberg and Sin-Itiro Tomonaga. Many of the university's alumni became important scientists.

=== Nazi period ===
Under [[Nazi]] rule many degrees of [[Jews]] were cancelled.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://article.wn.com/view/2012/04/18/A_Jewish_Palestinians_quest_to_receive_his_degree_from_Nazi_/ |title=A Jewish Palestinian's quest to receive his degree, from Nazi Germany |publisher=wn.com |access-date=31 December 2013}}</ref> Some were later reinstated as Karl-Marx University degrees by the GDR. Noteworthy Nazis, such as [[Max Clara]] (chair of anatomy) taught at the university and were appointed to positions with great authority.

The university was kept open throughout World War II, even after the destruction of its buildings. During the war the acting rector, [[Erich Maschke]], described the continuation of the university in a memo on 11 May 1945, announcing the vote for a new rector:
{{quote|Since 4 December 1943 a fixed determination not to abandon the Leipzig University in the most difficult hour of its more than five-hundred-year history has bonded the professors with each other and with the students. The special task of repairing the damage caused by air attacks has now broadened out to the more general duty to save the continuity of our university and preserve its substance, at the very least its indestructible kernel, through the crisis that has now reached its fullest stage. After the destruction of most of the buildings and the majority of its libraries, this kernel is represented by the professoriate alone. This is what must be preserved as the great repository of value in the university.<ref>Universitätsarchiv Leipzig, Rectorate 50. Quoted in {{cite book|last=Grondin|first=Jean|title=Hans-Georg Gadamer: A Biography|year=2003|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|isbn=0-300-09841-3|page=234}}</ref>}}

By the end of the war 60 per cent of the university's buildings and 70 per cent of its books had been destroyed.

=== The university under the German Democratic Republic ===
The university reopened after the war on 5 February 1946, but it was affected by the uniformity imposed on social institutions in the [[Soviet occupation zone]]. In 1948 the freely elected student council was disbanded and replaced by [[Free German Youth]] members. The chairman of the Student Council, [[Wolfgang Natonek]], and other members were arrested and imprisoned, but the university was also a nucleus of resistance. Thus began the Belter group, with flyers for free elections. The head of the group, [[Herbert Belter]], was executed in 1951 in Moscow. The [[East Germany|German Democratic Republic]] was created in 1949, and in 1953 for [[Karl Marx Year]] the university was renamed by its government the '''Karl Marx University, Leipzig''' after [[Karl Marx]]. In 1968, the partly damaged [[Augusteum (Leipzig)|Augusteum]], including Johanneum and Albertinum and the intact [[Paulinerkirche, Leipzig|Paulinerkirche]], were demolished to make way for a redevelopment of the university, carried out between 1973 and 1978. The dominant building of the university was the University Tower (now [[City-Hochhaus Leipzig]]), built between 1968 and 1972 in the form of an open book.

=== After the reunification of Germany ===
[[File:Leipzig University.JPG|thumb|Main building of Leipzig University since 2012, the [[Augusteum (Leipzig)|Augusteum]] at [[Augustusplatz]].]]
[[File:Bibliotheca Albertina.jpg|thumb|Leipzig's classicist university library, the Bibliotheca Albertina.]]
In 1991, following the [[reunification of Germany]], the university's name was restored to the original Leipzig University (''Alma mater lipsiensis''). The reconstruction of the University Library, which was heavily damaged during the war and in the [[East Germany|GDR]] barely secured, was completed in 2002.

With the delivery of the [[City-Hochhaus Leipzig|University Tower]] to a private user, the university was forced to spread some faculties over several locations in the city. It controversially redesigned its historical centre at the [[Augustusplatz]]. In 2002, Behet Bonzio received the second prize in the architectural competition; a first prize was not awarded by the jury. A lobby with partial support of the provincial government called for the rebuilding of [[Paulinerkirche, Leipzig|St. Paul's Church]] and [[Augusteum (Leipzig)|Augusteum]]. This caused the resistance of the university leadership, the majority of the students and population of Leipzig. On 24 March 2004 a jury chose a design by Dutch architect [[Erick van Egeraat]], which was well received by almost all parties. He recalls the outer form of the St. Paul's Church (today called [[Paulinum (University of Leipzig)|Paulinum]]) and Augusteum, and abstracted the original building complex. Renovations began in the summer of 2005.

In 2008 the university was able to prevail in the nationwide "Initiative of Excellence" of Germany and it was granted the graduate school "[[BuildMoNa]]: Leipzig School of Natural Sciences – Building with Molecules and Nano-objects".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.buildmona.de|title=Graduate School BuildMoNa|date=17 May 2013|publisher=Buildmona.de|author=Dr. Alexander Weber|access-date=31 December 2013}}</ref> In addition, the university was able to receive grants from the Saxon excellence initiative for the "Life" project – a project that tries to explore common diseases more effectively. Also in 2008 the [[Bach-Archiv Leipzig|"Bach Archive"]] was associated with the university. In 2009, the Leipzig University celebrated its 600th anniversary with over 300 scientific and cultural lectures and exhibitions,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sechshundert.de/index1_e.php?JavaScript=On|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719084528/http://www.sechshundert.de/index1_e.php?JavaScript=On|url-status=dead|title=Universität Leipzig 600th Anniversary|archive-date=19 July 2011}}</ref> reflecting the role of the university's research and teaching from its beginning.

== Campus ==
The university's urban campus comprises several locations. All in all, the university is spread across 38 locations in Leipzig. The main buildings in the city center are still located on the same land plots as the earliest university buildings in 1409. The university's buildings in the center of Leipzig underwent substantial reconstruction from 2005, the new university's main building being drafted by Dutch architect [[Erick van Egeraat]]. The estimated total cost for the renovation project is 140 million euros. The new buildings were scheduled to be completed in 2009/2010, in time for the university's 600th anniversary celebrations.

Besides the faculties and other teaching institutions, several other bodies serve the university: the University Library, a university archive and administration, numerous museums (e.g. the [[Museum of Musical Instruments of the University of Leipzig|Museum for Music Instruments]] and the Museum of Ancient Egypt) and the university hospital. The university's [[Leipzig Botanical Garden]], the second-oldest botanical garden in Europe. was established in 1542.
The University's Musical Instrument Museum includes one of the world's three surviving [[piano]]s built by [[Bartolomeo Cristofori]], the piano's inventor. Five other Cristofori instruments are included in the Museum's collections.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://mfm.uni-leipzig.de/_eng/dasmuseum/europ_Musical_Instruments.php?navid=16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080925115414/http://mfm.uni-leipzig.de/_eng/dasmuseum/europ_Musical_Instruments.php?navid=16|url-status=dead|title=Museum of Musical Instruments|archive-date=25 September 2008}}</ref>

== Library ==
The [[Leipzig University Library|University Library of Leipzig]] was established in 1543. It is one of the oldest German university libraries and it serves as a source of literature and information for the Leipzig University as well as the general public in the region. Its extensive historical and special collections are nationally and internationally recognized. The library consists of the main building "Bibliotheca Albertina" and forty branches situated near their respective academic institutions. The current stock comprises 5 million volumes and about 7,700 periodicals. Collections range from important medieval and modern manuscripts to incunabula, papyri, autographs, ostraka and coins.

== Academics ==
Today, the university has 14 faculties. With over 29,000 students, it is Saxony's second-largest university. There are now more than 150 institutes and the university offers 190 study programs leading to [[Bachelor's degree]]s, [[Master's degree]]s, [[Staatsexamen]], [[Diplom]]<ref>Since the adoption of the Bachelor's degree and Master's degree only three study programs leading to Diplom have remained: Maths, Mathematical economics and Protestant [[Christian Theology]].</ref> and [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.s]].
The university offers a number of courses in English and other foreign languages, and there are several programs which have been specially designed for foreign students. Exchange partner universities include the universities of [[University of Arizona|Arizona]], [[University of Oklahoma|Oklahoma]], [[University of Houston|Houston]], [[University of Alberta|Alberta]], [[Ohio University|Ohio]], and [[University of Edinburgh|Edinburgh]]. Traditionally contacts to universities in Eastern Europe and the Far East are strong as well, e.g. there are cooperations with leading institutions such as Moscow's [[Lomonosov University]] and [[Renmin University of China|Renmin University]] in Beijing.[[File:Anatomie-Leipzig.jpg|thumb|Anatomy auditorium of the Faculty of Medicine]]There are several International Master's programs: American Studies, Global Studies, Sustainable Development Studies, SEPT<ref>SEPT, the international Program of the University of Leipzig for Small and Medium-Sized Enterprise promotion and training http://www.sept.uni-leipzig.de/</ref> (MBA in SME Promotion)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sept.uni-leipzig.de/MBA-Program.10.0.html |title=SEPT – MBA program at glance |publisher=Sept.uni-leipzig.de |access-date=31 December 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014113612/http://www.sept.uni-leipzig.de/MBA-Program.10.0.html |archive-date=14 October 2007  }}</ref> and one Bachelor/Master's/Ph.D. program (International Physics Studies Program<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uni-leipzig.de/~intphys/ |title=Homepage of the International Physics Studies Program at Leipzig |publisher=Uni-leipzig.de |access-date=31 December 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120212191308/http://www.uni-leipzig.de/~intphys/ |archive-date=12 February 2012  }}</ref>) taught in English. American Studies Leipzig was awarded three international professorships: The Fulbright-Leipzig Chair for American Studies, the DAAD Professorship for American and International Studies, and the Picador Guest Professorship for Literature.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://americanstudies.uni-leipzig.de/picador |title=The Picador Guest Professorship for Literature &#124; American Studies Leipzig |publisher=Americanstudies.uni-leipzig.de |access-date=31 December 2013}}</ref> It is also the home of [[Aspeers|''Aspeers – Emerging voices in American Studies'']], a graduate-level peer-reviewed scholarly journal for [[American studies]]. Erasmus Mundus Global Studies is an interdisciplinary, research-based Master offered by a consortium of five European universities: Leipzig University, the [[London School of Economics]], [[University of Vienna]], [[University of Wroclaw]] and [[Roskilde University]]. In the field of anthropology, the university is cooperating with the Leipzig [[Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology]]. In 1995, the Leibniz-Institute for Jewish History and Culture named after [[Simon Dubnow]] was formed as a research institution related to the university. Since 2008 the university is also home to one of Germany's few [[Confucius Institute]]s. The Institute is based on an agreement of June 2006 between the university administration and representatives of the Chinese Embassy to establish a Confucius Institute in cooperation with the Renmin University and the "National Office for Teaching Chinese as a Foreign Language". Leipzig University has been the home of the first German chair for Chinese and East Asian Languages in the 19th century, which later became the Institute of East Asian Studies, which still exists today (see [[Georg von der Gabelentz]]).
