Leto played Paul Allen, a rival of [[Patrick Bateman]], in the psychological thriller ''[[American Psycho (film)|American Psycho]]'' (2000).

===2002–2005: From ''Panic Room'' to ''A Beautiful Lie''===
Leto returned to acting in 2002 with the thriller ''[[Panic Room]]'', which marked his second teaming with director David Fincher. He played the supporting role of Junior, a burglar who terrorizes [[Jodie Foster]]'s character Meg Altman. The film was well received by critics and became a financial success, grossing nearly US$200 million worldwide.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/panic_room/|title=Panic Room (2002)|work=Rotten Tomatoes|publisher=Flixster|accessdate=December 7, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=panicroom.htm|title=Panic Room (2002)|publisher=Box Office Mojo|accessdate=July 15, 2010}}</ref> In 2003, Leto and Cameron Diaz ended their four-year relationship.<ref name="Diaz"/> Leto's next film was the 2004 biographical film ''[[Alexander (2004 film)|Alexander]]'', directed by [[Oliver Stone]]. He portrayed [[Hephaestion]], the closest friend of [[Alexander the Great]]. The film failed in the United States; Stone attributed its poor reception to disapproval of the depiction of Alexander's bisexuality, but it succeeded internationally, with worldwide revenue of US$167 million.<ref>{{cite web|last=Goodridge|first=Mike|url=http://www.advocate.com/news/2005/01/24/why-alexander-wont-meet-oscar|title=Why Alexander won't meet Oscar|date=January 24, 2005|work=[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]]|accessdate=December 7, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=alexander.htm|title=Alexander (2004)|publisher=Box Office Mojo|accessdate=January 28, 2014}}</ref>

The following year, Leto starred together with [[Nicolas Cage]] in the political crime thriller ''[[Lord of War]]''. He played Vitaly, the younger brother of illegal arms dealer Yuri Orlov. The film was officially endorsed by the human rights group [[Amnesty International]] for highlighting the [[arms trafficking]] by the international arms industry.{{sfn|Hamid|2006|p=52}} It was positively received by movie critics and was a moderate commercial success.<ref>{{cite news|last=Burr|first=Ty|url=https://www.boston.com/ae/movies/articles/2005/09/16/provocative_war_skillfully_takes_aim/|title=Provocative 'War' skillfully takes aim|date=September 16, 2005|work=[[The Boston Globe]]|accessdate=December 7, 2013}}</ref>

It took two years to record Thirty Seconds to Mars' second studio album ''[[A Beautiful Lie]]'', with the band traveling to four different continents to accommodate Leto's acting career. ''A Beautiful Lie'' was released on August 30, 2005, in the United States. It has since been certified platinum by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA), and has reached platinum and gold status in several countries, with a sales total of over four million.{{sfn|Winwood|2012|p=22}} The band heavily toured in support of the album and played at several major festivals, including [[Roskilde Festival|Roskilde]], [[Pinkpop]], [[Rock am Ring]], and [[Download Festival|Download]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/thirty-seconds-to-mars-mn0000485365/biography|title=Thirty Seconds to Mars|first=Andrew|last=Leahey|work=AllMusic|publisher=All Media Network|accessdate=May 18, 2013}}</ref>

===2006–2008: ''Lonely Hearts'', ''Chapter 27'', and filmmaking===

In 2006, Leto appeared in the neo-noir crime drama ''[[Lonely Hearts (2006 film)|Lonely Hearts]]'', the true story of the notorious "lonely hearts killers" of the 1940s, [[Raymond Fernandez and Martha Beck]]. Playing Fernandez, he co-starred with [[Salma Hayek]] who played the role Beck. The film received mixed reviews from critics; however, Leto's acting was widely praised; Heather Huntington from [[Reelz]] wrote that his "layered performance as the nattily dressing dandy with no remorse is truly impressive."<ref>{{cite web|last=Huntington |first=Heather |title=Lonely Hearts (2006) |url=http://www.reelz.com/movie/224133/lonely-hearts/reviews/ |publisher=[[Reelz]] |date=April 13, 2007 |accessdate=January 28, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131216033846/http://www.reelz.com/movie/224133/lonely-hearts/reviews/ |archive-date=December 16, 2013 }}</ref>

The same year, Leto directed the music video for "[[The Kill]]", a song by Thirty Seconds to Mars.

In 2007, Leto starred in the biographical film ''[[Chapter 27]]''. He portrayed [[Mark David Chapman]], a fanatic fan of [[The Beatles]] and the murderer of [[John Lennon]].

He portrayed the title role of Nemo Nobody, the last mortal on Earth after the human race has achieved quasi-immortality.
