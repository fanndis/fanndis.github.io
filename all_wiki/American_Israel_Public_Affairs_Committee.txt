==History==
The American Israel Public Affairs Committee was founded in 1951 by [[Isaiah L. Kenen|Isaiah L. "Si" Kenen]].<ref>{{cite book|title=1001 Facts Everyone Should Know About Israel|year=2005|publisher=[[Rowman & Littlefield]]|location=Lanham, Maryland|isbn=0-7425-4357-9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hohspDWqzjwC|author=Bard, Mitchell Geoffrey|author-link=Mitchell Geoffrey Bard|author2=Schwartz, Moshe|accessdate=March 22, 2012|page=148}}</ref> Kenen originally ran the '''American Zionist Committee for Public Affairs''' as a lobbying division of the [[American Zionist Council]]. Before that, Kenen was an employee of the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs. According to journalist Connie Bruck, AIPAC was incorporated in 1963<ref name=bruck-53>{{cite journal|last1=Bruck|first1=Connie|title=Friends of Israel|journal=The New Yorker|date=September 1, 2014|page=53|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/09/01/friends-israel|accessdate=September 9, 2014}}</ref> and headed by Kenen until he retired in 1974. Kenen was "an old-fashioned liberal," according to former AIPAC volunteer journalist [[M.J. Rosenberg]], who did not seek to win support by donating to campaigns or otherwise influencing elections, but was willing to "play with the hand that is dealt us."<ref name=bruck-53/>

[[Michael Oren]] writes in his book, ''Power, Faith, and Fantasy: America in the Middle East 1776 to the Present'': "Though founded in 1953, AIPAC had only now in the mid-70s, achieved the financial and political clout necessary to sway congressional opinion. Confronted with opposition from both houses of Congress, [[United States President]] [[Gerald Ford]] rescinded his '[[Gerald Ford#Middle East|reassessment]].'"<ref name = MO>[[Michael Oren]] (2007). ''Power, Faith, and Fantasy: America in the Middle East 1776 to the Present'' (New York: W.W. Norton & Company) p. 536. <blockquote>The infelicitous combination of Ford and Rabin produced the direst crisis in US-Israeli relations since Suez, with Ford pronouncing a "reassessment" of American support for the Jewish state. Rabin responded by mobilizing the American Israel Public Affairs Committee --- AIPAC, the pro-Israel lobby --- against the president. Though founded in 1953, AIPAC had only now in the mid-70s, achieved the financial and political clout necessary to sway congressional opinion. Confronted with opposition from both houses of Congress, Ford rescinded his "reassessment".
</blockquote></ref>
[[George Lenczowski]] notes a similar, mid-1970s, timeframe for the rise of AIPAC power. "It [the [[Jimmy Carter|Carter]] Presidency] also coincides with the militant emergence of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) as a major force in shaping American policy toward the Middle East."<ref>{{cite book | last=Lenczowski | first=George | author-link=George Lenczowski | year=1990 | title=American Presidents and the Middle East | publisher=[[Duke University Press]] | isbn=0-8223-0972-6 | page=157 }}</ref> He further notes that this period also coincides with a major shift in Israeli government policies related to the [[1977 Israeli legislative election|election]] of [[Menachem Begin]] in Israel.

In 1980, [[Thomas Dine]] became the executive director of AIPAC, and developed its grassroots campaign. By the late 1980s, AIPAC's board of directors was "dominated" by four successful businessmen—Mayer (Bubba) Mitchell, Edward Levy, Robert Asher, and [[Larry Weinberg]].<ref name=bruck-54>{{cite journal|last1=Bruck|first1=Connie|title=Friends of Israel|journal=The New Yorker|date=September 1, 2014|pages=53–4|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/09/01/friends-israel|accessdate=September 9, 2014}}</ref>

AIPAC scored two major victories in the early 1980s that established its image among political candidates as an organization "not to be trifled with" and set the pace for "a staunchly pro-Israel" Congress over the next three decades.<ref name="Stolberg-too-powerful-4-3-2019"/>   In 1982, activists affiliated with AIPAC in [[Skokie, Illinois]] backed [[Richard J. Durbin]] to oust U.S. Representative [[Paul Findley]] ([[Republican Party (United States)|R]]-[[Illinois]]), who had shown enthusiasm for [[PLO]] leader [[Yasir Arafat]]. In 1984, Senator [[Charles H. Percy]] (R-Illinois), then-chairman of the [[United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations|Senate Foreign Relations Committee]] and a supporter of a deal to allow [[Saudi Arabia]] to buy sophisticated [[Airborne early warning and control]] (AWAC) military planes was defeated by Democrat [[Paul Simon (politician)|Paul Simon]]. Simon was asked by Robert Asher, an AIPAC board member in Chicago, to run against Percy.<ref name="Stolberg-too-powerful-4-3-2019"/>

In 2005, Lawrence Franklin, a [[The Pentagon|Pentagon]] analyst pleaded guilty to espionage charges of passing [[US government|U.S. government]] secrets to AIPAC policy director [[Steve J. Rosen|Steven Rosen]] and AIPAC senior [[Iran]] analyst Keith Weissman, in what is known as the [[AIPAC espionage scandal]]. Rosen and Weissman were later fired by AIPAC.<ref>[http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3151394,00.html Guilty plea entered in Pentagon Spy Case] Ynet News. 10/06/05</ref> In 2009, charges against the former AIPAC employees were dropped.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/02/us/politics/02aipac.html | work=The New York Times | first1=Neil A. | last1=Lewis | first2=David | last2=Johnston | title=U.S. to Drop Spy Case Against Pro-Israel Lobbyists | date=May 2, 2009}}</ref>

In February 2019, freshman U.S. Representative [[Ilhan Omar]] (D-[[Minnesota]]), one of the first two [[Muslim]] women (along with [[Rashida Tlaib]]) to serve in Congress, created a controversy by tweeting that House Minority Leader [[Kevin McCarthy (California politician)|Kevin McCarthy]]'s (R-California) support for Israel was “all about the Benjamins” (i.e. about [[United States one hundred-dollar bill|the money]]).<ref name="BADE-11-2-19">{{cite news |last1=BADE |first1=RACHAEL  | authorlink1 = Rachael Bade|last2=PHILLIPS |first2=KRISTINE |last3=DEBONIS |first3=MIKE |last4=FLYNN |first4=MEAGAN |title=Democratic leaders call Ilhan Omar's Israel tweets 'deeply offensive' |url=https://www.twincities.com/2019/02/11/ilhan-omar-democrat-minnesota-again-accused-anti-semitism-over-tweets-benjamins-baby/ |accessdate=8 March 2019 |agency=The Washington Post|date=11 February 2019}}</ref> The next day, she clarified that she meant AIPAC.<ref name="Beauchamp-6-3-19">{{cite news |last1=Beauchamp |first1=Zack |title=The controversy over Ilhan Omar and AIPAC money, explained |url=https://www.vox.com/2019/2/11/18220160/ilhan-omar-aipac-benjamins-kevin-mccarthy |accessdate=8 March 2019 |agency=Vox |date=6 March 2019}}</ref> Omar later apologized but also made another statement attacking "political influence in this country that says it is okay to push for allegiance to a foreign country.”  The statements aroused anger among AIPAC supporters, but also vocal support among the progressive wing of the Democratic Party and "revived a fraught debate" in American politics over whether AIPAC has too much influence over American policy in the Middle East,<ref name="Stolberg-too-powerful-4-3-2019">{{cite news |last1=Stolberg |first1=Sheryl Gay |title=Ilhan Omar's Criticism Raises the Question: Is Aipac Too Powerful? |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/04/us/politics/aipac-congress-democrats.html |accessdate=8 March 2019 |agency=The New York Times |date=4 March 2019}}</ref> while highlighting the deterioration of some relationships between progressive Democrats and pro-Israel organizations.<ref name="Beauchamp-6-3-19"/> On March 6, 2019, the Democratic leadership put forth a resolution on the [[United States House of Representatives|House]] floor condemning anti-Semitism, which was broadened to condemn bigotry against a wide variety of groups before it passed on March 7.<ref name="Stolberg-7-3-2019">{{cite news |last1=Stolberg |first1=Sheryl Gay |title=House Votes to Condemn All Hate as Anti-Semitism Debate Overshadows Congress |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/07/us/politics/ilhan-omar-anti-semitism-vote.html |accessdate=8 March 2019 |agency=The New York Times |date=7 March 2019}}</ref><ref name="Friedman-6-3-2019">{{cite news |last1=Friedman |first1=Thomas L. |title=Ilhan Omar, Aipac and Me |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/06/opinion/israel-ilhan-omar.html |accessdate=8 March 2019 |agency=The New York Times |date=6 March 2019}}</ref>

==Aims, activities, size, successes==

AIPAC's stated purpose is to lobby the [[Congress of the United States]] on issues and legislation related to Israel. AIPAC regularly meets with members of Congress and holds events where it can share its views. AIPAC is not a [[political action committee]] and does not donate to political candidates.

===Size===
As of early 2019, AIPAC had 17 regional and satellite offices and a new headquarters on [[K Street (Washington, D.C.)|K Street]] in Washington, D.C.<ref name="Stolberg-too-powerful-4-3-2019"/> AIPAC spent $3.5 million on lobbying in 2018, a relatively large sum in the realm of foreign policy (more than 10 times [[J Street]]'s lobbying expenditure).<ref name="Beauchamp-6-3-19"/>

===Generating support among policymakers===

While it would be illegal for AIPAC to raise money for political campaigns, or to donate to candidates, AIPAC unofficially orchestrates campaign contributions by bringing together candidates it favors with large donors and [[bundler (campaigning)|bundlers]] and through a network of [[political action committees]], such as [[NORPAC]].<ref>[[60 Minutes]], 23 Oct. 1988, [https://vimeo.com/24406512 "AIPAC"]</ref> Today, thousands of AIPAC supporters gather at AIPAC's annual Policy Conference in Washington, D.C. every year.

AIPAC has created "caucuses" in every [[congressional district]], with AIPAC staffers organizing every district's Jewish community, regardless of size. Campaign contributions were bundled and distributed to candidates in congressional districts and where they would do some good. According to journalist Connie Bruck, by the end of the 1980s, there were "dozens" of political action committees with no formal relation to AIPAC, but whose leader was often an AIPAC member.<ref name="bruck-3percent" /> ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' reports that in 1987 at least 51 of 80 pro-Israel PACs were operated by AIPAC officials.<ref>''The Wall Street Journal'', June 24, 1987, p.1</ref><ref name="Thomas-100">{{cite book|last1=Thomas|first1=Michael|title=American Policy Toward Israel: The Power and Limits of Beliefs |publisher=Routledge |page=100|year=2007|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Dc2TAgAAQBAJ&q=PACs+of++AIPAC+members&pg=PA100|isbn=9781135983451}}</ref> Some committees that "operate independently" of AIPAC but "whose missions and membership align" with it include the Florida Congressional Committee, NORPAC in [[New Jersey]], To Protect Our Heritage PAC near [[Chicago]], and the [[Maryland]] Association for Concerned Citizens near [[Baltimore]].<ref name="Stolberg-too-powerful-4-3-2019" />

''[[The Washington Post]]'' states that AIPAC's <blockquote>web site, which details how members of Congress voted on AIPAC's key issues, and the ''AIPAC Insider'', a glossy periodical that handicaps close political races, are scrutinized by thousands of potential donors. Pro-Israel interests have contributed $56.8 million in individual, group, and [[soft money]] donations to federal candidates and party committees since 1990, according to the non-partisan [[Center for Responsive Politics]]. Between the 2000 and the 2004 elections, the 50 members of AIPAC's board donated an average of $72,000 each to campaigns and political action committees."<ref name="Post-friendship">[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/07/12/AR2006071201627_pf.html A Beautiful Friendship?][[The Washington Post]], July 16, 2006</ref></blockquote>

According to Dine, in the 1980s and 1990s, contributions from AIPAC members often constituted "roughly 10 to 15% of a typical congressional campaign budget."<ref name=bruck/>

AIPAC influences lawmakers in other ways by:
*matching an AIPAC member with shared interests to a member of Congress.<ref name=bruck-expenses>{{cite journal|last1=Bruck|first1=Connie|title=Friends of Israel|journal=The New Yorker|date=September 1, 2014|page=53|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/09/01/friends-israel|accessdate=September 9, 2014|quote=AIPAC representatives tried to match each member of Congress with a contact who shared the congressman's interests.

According to the Jewish Virtual Library, from 1967 to 2012, opinion polls have found sympathy for Israel varying "between 32 and 64 percent, averaging 46 percent," and sympathy for the Arabs oscillating "between 1 and 30 percent and averaged only 12 percent."<ref name=JVL-opion>{{cite web|last1=Bard|first1=Mitchell|title=Congress & the Middle East: The Pro-Israel & Pro-Arab Lobbies|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/US-Israel/lobby.html|website=Jewish Viritual Library|accessdate=September 12, 2014|date= July 2012}}</ref>

AIPAC has supported loyal incumbents (such as Senator [[Lowell P. Weicker, Jr.|Lowell Weicker]] (R-[[Connecticut]]) even when opposed by Jewish candidates, and the organization has worked to unseat pro-Palestinian incumbents (such as Representative [[Paul Findley]]) or candidates perceived to be unsympathetic to Israel (Senator [[Charles H. Percy]]).<ref name=bruck/> However, a Jewish member of Congress, Representative [[Jan Schakowsky]] (D-Illinois), who had maintained good relations with AIPAC and had been given campaign contributions by its members, was opposed by the group in her 2010 reelection campaign after she was endorsed by the advocacy group [[J Street]].<ref name=bruck/>

According to former Representative [[Brian Baird]] (D-[[Washington (state)|Washington]]), <blockquote>Any member of Congress knows that AIPAC is associated indirectly with significant amounts of campaign spending if you're with them, and significant amounts against you if you're not with them.</blockquote> 
"AIPAC-connected money" amounted to about $200,000 in each of his campaigns for office — "and that's two hundred thousand going your way, versus the other way: a four-hundred-thousand-dollar swing."<ref name=bruck-p58>{{cite journal|last1=Bruck|first1=Connie|title=Friends of Israel|journal=The New Yorker|date=September 1, 2014|page=58 column 1|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/09/01/friends-israel|accessdate=September 9, 2014}}</ref> AIPAC-directed campaign contributions—as with many interest groups—came with considerable "tactical input." AIPAC staffers told Baird and other lawmakers, "No, we don't say it that way, we say it this way." Baird complained, "There's a whole complex semantic code you learn. . . . After a while, you find yourself saying and repeating it as if it were fact."<ref name="bruck" />

===Goals===

AIPAC strongly supports substantial [[US aid to Israel|U.S. aid to Israel]]. In March 2009, AIPAC executive director Howard Kohr appeared before the [[United States House Committee on Appropriations|House Committee on Appropriations]]' [[United States House Appropriations Subcommittee on State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs|Foreign Operations subcommittee]] and requested that Israel receive $2.775 billion in military aid in fiscal year 2010, as called for in the 2007 [[Memorandum of understanding|Memorandum of Understanding]] between the U.S. and Israel that allocates $30 billion in aid for Israel over 10 years. Kohr stated that "American assistance to Israel serves vital U.S. national security interests and advances critical U.S. foreign policy goals." The military hardware Israel must purchase to face the increased threat of terrorism and Islamist radicalism is increasingly expensive due to the recent spike in petroleum prices which have enabled countries such as Iran to augment their military budgets, according to Kohr.<ref name=Usa/><ref>[http://jta.org/news/article/2009/03/27/1004048/aipac-head-testifies-on-israel-aid AIPAC head testifies on Israel aid] by Eric Fingerhut, Jewish Telegraphic Agency (JTA), March 27, 2009.</ref>

Whether AIPAC lobbied for the [[Iraq War]] is disputed. Representative [[Jim Moran]] (D-[[Virginia]]) has stated that AIPAC had been "pushing the [Iraq War] from the beginning."<ref name="politico moran"/> A report in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' also reported that AIPAC lobbied Congress in favor of the war.<ref>{{cite magazine|author=Jeffrey Goldberg |url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2005/07/04/real-insiders |title=Real Insiders |magazine=The New Yorker |date=July 4, 2005 |accessdate=March 17, 2016}}</ref> However, according to the [[Jewish News]], AIPAC never supported or lobbied for the war in Iraq.<ref name="JewishNews">[http://www.jewishsf.com/content/2-0-/module/displaystory/story_id/31882/format/html/displaystory.html AIPAC meeting wasn't supposed to be partisan, but ...], Jewish News Weekly of Northern California, March 16, 2007.</ref> According to a columnist at ''The Washington Post'': "Once it was clear that the [[Presidency of George W.

AIPAC's official position on Iran is to encourage a strong diplomatic and economic response coordinated among the [[United States government]], its European allies, Russia, and China.<ref name="Post-friendship" />

In 2012, AIPAC called for "crippling" sanctions on Iran in a letter to every member of Congress.<ref>[http://www.asiaone.com/News/AsiaOne%2BNews/World/Story/A1Story20100310-203620.html US-Israel group demands "crippling" Iran sanctions] March 10, 2010| AFP</ref> In line with this approach, AIPAC has lobbied to levy economic [[embargo]]es and increase [[International sanctions|sanctions]] on Iran (known as the Nuclear Weapon Free Iran Act of 2013).<ref name="About AIPAC">{{cite web|title=What We've Accomplished|url=http://www.aipac.org/en/about/what-weve-accomplished|publisher=AIPAC|accessdate=September 12, 2018}}</ref>  However, according to ''The New York Times'', its effort "stalled after stiff resistance from President Obama."<ref name=LANDLER/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.algemeiner.com/2014/02/07/aipac-clarifies-position-on-iran-sanctions-bill-in-letter-to-supporters/ |title= AIPAC Clarifies Position on Iran Sanctions Bill in Letter to Supporters |date=February 7, 2014 |website=www.algemeiner.com |publisher=algemeiner.com |accessdate=February 8, 2014}}</ref> AIPAC opposed President Obama's nuclear deal with Iran, formally the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), because the agreement did not address Iranian ballistic missiles, among other issues.

In 1997, ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'' magazine named AIPAC the second-most powerful influence group in Washington, D.C.<ref>''Jewish News of Greater Phoenix''. (November 11, 1998).

According to journalist Connie Bruck, AIPAC has been able to "deliver the support of Congress" and prevent any president who wants to negotiate with Israel using "the multibillion-dollar packages of military aid that go to Israel each year" as leverage by passing the funding and taking away this "strongest negotiating chit."<ref name=Coaster>{{cite web|last1=Coaster|first1=Lefty|title=The New Yorker looks at AIPAC and its bold opposition to US peace initiatives|url=http://www.dailykos.com/story/2014/08/25/1324597/-The-New-Yorker-looks-at-AIPAC-and-its-bold-opposition-to-US-peace-initiatives|website=Huffington Post|accessdate=September 12, 2014|date=August 25, 2014}}</ref> However, contrary to Bruck's point, under the Memorandum of Understanding between the U.S. and Israel, all military financing agreements must be passed by Congress.

AIPAC advises members of Congress about the issues that face today's Middle East, including the dangers of extremism and terrorism. It was an early supporter of the Counter-Terrorism Act of 1995, which resulted in increased FBI resources being committed to fight terrorism,<ref>{{cite news |last1=Bruck |first1=Connie |title=Friends of Israel |url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/09/01/friends-israel |accessdate=November 4, 2018 |agency=The New Yorker |issue=September 1, 2014}}</ref> as well as expanded federal jurisdiction in prosecuting criminal activities related to terrorism.{{citation needed|date=May 2011}}

AIPAC has also supported the funding of a number of Israeli military projects that have resulted in new additions to the arsenal of the United States Armed Forces.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}} One such outcome is the production of Israel's [[Arrow (Israeli missile)|Arrow]] anti-missile system at a [[Boeing]] plant in [[Huntsville, Alabama]] for use by both the United States and Israel. Additionally, the U.S. military has purchased Israeli-made [[tank]] armor, [[unmanned aerial vehicles]], and other technologies for use in its operations.

AIPAC also lobbies for financial aid from the United States to Israel, helping to procure up to $3 billion in aid yearly, making Israel "the largest cumulative recipient of U.S. foreign assistance since World War II."<ref>Sharp, Jeremy M.: "U.S. Foreign Aid to Israel", Introduction, "CRS Report for Congress", Order Code RL33222</ref> According to the [[Congressional Research Service]] (CRS), these include providing aid "as all grant cash transfers, not designated for particular projects, and...transferred as a lump sum in the first month of the fiscal year, instead of in periodic increments. Israel is allowed to spend about one quarter of the military aid for the procurement in Israel of defense articles and services, including research and development, rather than in the United States."<ref>Migdalovitz, Carol: "Israel: Background and Relations with the United States", page 29.

==Controversy and criticism==

===Criticism===
One critic, former Congressman [[Brian Baird]], who "had admired Israel since I was a kid," but became alienated from AIPAC, argued that
"When key votes are cast, the question on the House floor, troublingly, is often not, 'What is the right thing to do for the United States of America?', but 'How is AIPAC going to score this?'"
He cited a 2009 House resolution he opposed condemning the [[Goldstone Report]] on civilian deaths. "When we had the vote, I said, 'We have member after member coming to the floor to vote on a resolution they've never read, about a report they've never seen, in a place they've never been.'"<ref name=bruck/>
Baird worries that AIPAC members and supporters believe that they're "supporting Israel" when they are "actually backing policies" such as the killing of civilians in Gaza, "that are antithetical to its highest values and, ultimately, destructive for the country."<ref name=bruck/>

A criticism of AIPAC's proposal for tougher sanctions on [[Iran]] is that the primary incentive [[P5+1]] negotiators can give Iran to stop its nuclear program is reduction in the [[Sanctions against Iran|sanctions]] that have harmed Iran's economy. By imposing even harsher sanctions on Iran, AIPAC takes this chip away. According to a "senior" Obama Administration official, the administration told AIPAC leadership that its tougher sanctions on Iran "would blow up the negotiations – the Iranians would walk away from the table." The official asked them, "Why do you know better than we do what strengthens our hand? Nobody involved in the diplomacy thinks that."<ref name=bruck-53/> A former congressional staffer complained to journalist Connie Bruck, "What was striking was how strident the message was," from AIPAC. "'How could you not pass a resolution that tells the President what the outcome of the negotiations has to be?'"<ref name=bruck-60>{{cite journal|last1=Bruck|first1=Connie|title=Friends of Israel|journal=The New Yorker|date=September 1, 2014|page=60|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/09/01/friends-israel|accessdate=September 9, 2014}}</ref>

Among the best-known critical works about AIPAC is ''[[The Israel Lobby and U.S. Foreign Policy]]'', by [[University of Chicago]] professor [[John Mearsheimer]] and [[Harvard University]] [[Kennedy School of Government]] professor [[Stephen Walt]]. In the working paper and resulting book, they accuse AIPAC of being "the most powerful and best known" component of a larger pro-Israel lobby that distorts American foreign policy. They write:<ref name=Mear>{{cite journal

<blockquote>AIPAC's success is due to its ability to reward legislators and congressional candidates who support its agenda, and to punish those who challenge it. ... AIPAC makes sure that its friends get strong financial support from the myriad pro-Israel [[Political action committee|PAC]]s. Those seen as hostile to Israel, on the other hand, can be sure that AIPAC will direct campaign contributions to their political opponents. ... The bottom line is that AIPAC, which is a ''de facto'' agent for a foreign government, has a [[stranglehold]] on the U.S. Congress. Open debate about U.S. policy towards Israel does not occur there, even though that policy has important consequences for the entire world.</blockquote>

Democratic Congressman [[Jim Moran]] from [[Northern Virginia]] has been a vocal critic of AIPAC, causing national controversy in 2007 and drawing criticism from many Jewish groups after he told California Jewish magazine ''[[Tikkun (magazine)|Tikkun]]'' that AIPAC had been "pushing the [Iraq War] from the beginning," and that, "I don't think they represent the mainstream of American Jewish thinking at all, but because they are so well organized, and their members are extraordinarily powerful – most of them are quite wealthy – they have been able to exert power."<ref name="politico moran">{{cite news|last=Hearn|first=Josephine|title=Dems slam Moran's tying AIPAC to Iraq war|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0907/5925.html|accessdate=May 31, 2010|newspaper=Politico|date=September 19, 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100425053328/http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0907/5925.html| archivedate= April 25, 2010 | url-status= live}}</ref><ref name="washpost moran">{{cite news|last=Gardner|first=Amy|title= Moran Upsets Jewish Groups Again|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/09/14/AR2007091402171.html|accessdate=May 31, 2010|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=September 15, 2007}}</ref> AIPAC's membership has been described as "overwhelmingly Democratic" by one conservative columnist (Jennifer Rubin).<ref>{{cite news |last1=Rubin|first1=Jennifer |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/post/aipac-weighs-in-all-is-not-well-with-the-us-approach-to-israel/2011/03/29/AG6WrxVH_blog.html |work=The Washington Post |date=June 15, 2011 |title=AIPAC weighs in: All is not well with the U.S. approach to Israel |accessdate=May 29, 2013}}</ref>

===Controversies===
Former [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[William Fulbright]], in the 1970s, and former senior [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] official [[Victor Marchetti]], in the 1980s, contended that AIPAC should have registered under the [[Foreign Agents Registration Act]] (FARA).<ref>Ori Nir, [http://www.forward.com/articles/4064/ Leaders Fear Probe Will Force Pro-Israel Lobby To File as ‘Foreign Agent’], [[The Jewish Daily Forward]], December 31, 2004.</ref> FARA requires those who receive funds or act on behalf of a foreign government to register as a foreign agent. However, AIPAC states that the organization is a registered American lobbying group, funded by private donations, and maintains it receives "no financial assistance" from Israel or any other foreign group.<ref>{{cite web

In 2006, [[United States Representative|Representative]] [[Betty McCollum]] ([[Minnesota Democratic–Farmer–Labor Party|DFL]]) of [[Minnesota]] demanded an apology from AIPAC, claiming an AIPAC representative had described her vote against the Palestinian Anti-Terrorism Act of 2006 as "support for terrorists." McCollum stated that AIPAC representatives would not be allowed in her office until she received a written apology for the comment.<ref>{{cite magazine

===Steiner resignation===
In 1992, AIPAC president [[David Steiner (AIPAC)|David Steiner]] was forced to resign after he was recorded boasting about his political influence in obtaining aid for Israel. Steiner also claimed that he had
<blockquote>
met with (then Bush [[U.S. Secretary of State]]) Jim Baker and I cut a deal with him. I got, besides the $3 billion, you know they're looking for the Jewish votes, and I'll tell him whatever he wants to hear ... Besides the $10 billion in loan guarantees which was a fabulous thing, $3 billion in foreign, in military aid, and I got almost a billion dollars in other goodies that people don't even know about.<ref name="report">{{cite web|url=http://www.wrmea.com/backissues/1292/9212013.html|title=The Complete Unexpurgated AIPAC Tape|publisher=[[WRMEA]]}}</ref>
</blockquote>
Steiner also claimed to be "negotiating" with the incoming [[Bill Clinton|Clinton]] administration over who Clinton would appoint as [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] and Secretary of the [[National Security Agency]]. Steiner stated that AIPAC had "a dozen people in [the Clinton] campaign, in the headquarters... in Little Rock, and they're all going to get big jobs."<ref name="report"/>

NY real estate developer Haim Katz told ''[[The Washington Times]]'' that he taped the conversation because "as someone Jewish, I am concerned when a small group has a disproportionate power. I think that hurts everyone, including Jews. If David Steiner wants to talk about the incredible, disproportionate clout AIPAC has, the public should know about it."<ref>[http://www.washington-report.org/backissues/1292/9212069b.html AIPAC President Resigns], Sheldon L. Richman, December/January 1992/93, Page 69.</ref>

===Spying allegations===
{{Main|Lawrence Franklin espionage scandal}}
In April 2005, AIPAC policy director [[Steve J. Rosen|Steven Rosen]] and AIPAC senior Iran analyst [[Keith Weissman]] were fired by AIPAC amid an [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] investigation into whether they passed classified U.S. information received from [[Lawrence Franklin]] on to the government of Israel. They were later indicted for illegally conspiring to gather and disclose classified national security information to Israel.<ref>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A6059-2005Apr20.html "2 Senior AIPAC Employees Ousted"], ''[[The Washington Post]]'', April 21, 2005</ref><ref>Ticker, Bruce. [http://www.pjvoice.com/v3/004aipac.html AIPAC Charges Offer Opportunity], ''[[Philadelphia Jewish Voice]]'', September 2005. Accessed March 27, 2006.</ref>
AIPAC agreed to pay the legal fees for Weissman's defense through appeal if necessary,<ref>[http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1178708595983&pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull AIPAC to pay Weissman's legal fees] ''[[The Jerusalem Post]]'', May 14, 2007.</ref>
but charges were subsequently dropped.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/usPoliticsNews/idUKTRE54046320090501|title=U.S. to drop Israel lobbyist spy case|author=Reuters Editorial|date=May 1, 2009|agency=Reuters UK|accessdate=March 17, 2016}}</ref>

In May 2005, the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] announced that [[Larry Franklin|Lawrence Anthony Franklin]], a U.S. Air Force Reserves colonel working as a Department of Defense analyst at the Pentagon in the office of [[Douglas Feith]], had been arrested and charged by the FBI with providing classified national defense information to Israel. The six-count criminal complaint identified AIPAC by name and described a luncheon meeting in which, allegedly, Franklin disclosed top-secret information to two AIPAC officials.<ref name=rozen>Rozen, Laura and Vest, Jason. [http://www.prospect.org/web/page.ww?section=root&name=ViewPrint&articleId=8764 Cloak and Swagger], ''[[The American Prospect]]'', November 2, 2004.

Lawrence Anthony Franklin "],</ref>

Franklin pleaded guilty to passing government secrets to Rosen and Weissman and revealed for the first time that he also gave classified information directly to an Israeli government official in Washington. On January 20, 2006, he was sentenced to 151 months (almost 13 years) in prison and fined $10,000. As part of the plea agreement, Franklin agreed to cooperate in the larger federal investigation.<ref>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/10/05/AR2005100501608_pf.html "Defense Analyst Guilty in Israeli Espionage Case"], ''[[The Washington Post]]'', October 6, 2005</ref><ref>Barakat, Matthew.

==AIPAC in film==
An Israeli documentary film entitled "The Kings of Capital Hill" features interviews with former and current AIPAC personalities and depicts how AIPAC has moved toward the political right wing and away from political positions most American Jews hold.<ref>The Times of Israel, 7 Sept. 2020 [https://www.timesofisrael.com/new-israeli-film-projects-aipacs-steady-drift-from-idealistic-bipartisan-roots/?fbclid=IwAR1wRyMgxj-AERg8P_cVVrZ_-U2GIv6tDhThwqTrRuXr2QkxId6Ps_It3SA#gs.gldch4 "New Israeli Film Projects AIPAC's Steady Drift from Idealistic Bipartisan Roots ‘The Kings of Capitol Hill,’ Airing on Israel's YesDocu before Going Global, Examines How the Pro-Israel Lobby Eschewed Mainstream U.S. Jewry for Evangelical Christians and the Right"]</ref>
