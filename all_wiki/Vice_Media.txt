'''Vice Media Group LLC''' is an American-Canadian [[digital media]] and [[broadcasting]] company. Developing from [[Vice (magazine)|''Vice'']] magazine, originally based in [[Montreal]] and co-founded by [[Suroosh Alvi]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p04pz47r|title=Ex Heroin Addict Turned Media Mogul, Outlook – BBC World Service|website=BBC}}</ref> [[Shane Smith (journalist)|Shane Smith]], and [[Gavin McInnes]] (who left the company in 2008),<ref name="auto1" /> Vice expanded primarily into youth and young adult–focused [[digital media]]. This included online content [[Vertical marketing|verticals]] and related [[web series]], the news division [[Vice News]], a film production studio, and a [[record label]] among other properties. In 2015, Vice Media was called "[arguably] a poster child for new-media success—especially when it comes to attracting a valuable millennial audience."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://fortune.com/2015/05/05/vice-media-unicorn/|title=Vice is a new-media behemoth. But is it a unicorn?|website=Fortune|access-date=30 May 2017}}</ref> Vice re-located to [[New York City]] in 2001.

Vice Media previously broadcast their news programs on [[HBO]]. [[HBO]] broadcast the [[Emmy Award|Emmy]]-winning<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://m.emmys.com/shows/vice|title=Vice|website=Television Academy|language=en|access-date=2019-06-13}}</ref> weekly documentary series ''[[Vice (TV series)|Vice]]'', which premiered on the network in April 2013. ''Vice'' features segments on global issues hosted by Shane Smith, co-founder Suroosh Alvi, and a rotating cast of correspondents.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/05/arts/television/vice-a-new-approach-to-news-on-hbo.html|title='Vice,' a New Approach to News, on HBO|last=Hale|first=Mike|date=4 April 2013|work=The New York Times|access-date=8 March 2017|issn=0362-4331}}</ref><ref name="VICESeason5HBO" /> They also broadcast ''Vice News Tonight'', which premiered 10 October 2016, showcased a nightly roundup of global news, [[technology]], [[Natural environment|the environment]], [[economics]], and [[Popular culture|pop culture]] while eschewing traditional news anchors.<ref name="VICENewsTonightPostponesLauch" /><ref name="VICENewscastsnet" /><ref name=":0" /> However, on 10 June 2019, [[HBO]] announced the news program's cancellation in addition to the severing of relations with Vice Media after a seven-year partnership.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/10/media/vice-news-tonight-canceled-hbo/index.html|title=HBO cancels 'Vice News Tonight,' severing relationship with Vice Media|last=Business|first=Oliver Darcy, CNN|website=CNN|access-date=2019-06-13}}</ref>

==History==

=== Founding and early years (1994–2005) ===
Vice Media founders [[Shane Smith (journalist)|Shane Smith]], [[Suroosh Alvi]], and [[Gavin McInnes]]<ref>{{cite web|last1=Levine|first1=Robert|title=A Guerrilla Video Site Meets MTV|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/19/business/media/19vice.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=12 November 2014}}</ref> launched the magazine ''Voice of Montreal'' in October 1994 in Montreal, Quebec, Canada with government funding, to cover music, art, trends and drug culture not covered in print.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.adweek.com/digital/how-shane-smith-built-vice-25-billion-empire-160379/|title=How Shane Smith Built Vice Into a $2.5 Billion Empire|access-date=8 August 2017|language=en-US}}</ref> The magazine was an alternative to the ''[[Montreal Mirror]]'', then perceived as too mainstream by the Montreal alternative English-speaking scene. During the 1990s, Montreal's [[Plateau Mont-Royal]]/[[Mile-End]] neighbourhood was home to a burgeoning subculture with the advent of collectives such as [[Godspeed You! Black Emperor]], [[Dummies Theatre]], [[Bran Van 3000]] and later [[Arcade Fire]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Kelly|first1=Brendan|url=https://montrealgazette.com/entertainment/vice-and-alternative-anglos|title=Vice ... and alternative anglos|website=montrealgazette.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Kelly|first1=Brendan|url=https://montrealgazette.com/entertainment/quebec-culture-the-solitudes-and-the-theatre-of-the-absurd|title=Quebec culture, the solitudes and the theatre of the absurd|website=montrealgazette.com}}</ref>

They changed the name to ''Vice'' in 1996, and as the magazine became more successful, the company began to find it difficult to scale their operations while based in Canada.<ref>{{cite news|title=Vice Media to Launch Cable TV Channel in Canada|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/vice-media-launch-cable-tv-837395|access-date=29 February 2016|work=The Hollywood Reporter}}</ref> Following an investment of $4 million by Canadian investor Richard Szalwinski, Vice relocated to [[New York City]] in 1999. In 2001, the co-founders bought ''Vice'' back and moved to new offices in [[Williamsburg, Brooklyn]].<ref name=":2" /> The magazine continued to gain attention and readership due to its content, commentary, and contributions from photographers [[Terry Richardson]] and [[Ryan McGinley]]. The magazine then rapidly expanded internationally, with Andrew Creighton and [[Andy Capper]] co-founding the UK division of ''Vice''. The magazine then expanded further into five continents.

=== Digital expansion (2006–2011) ===
In 2006, on the advice of creative director [[Spike Jonze]], Vice began expanding into digital video, launching new video service [[VBS.tv]] as a joint venture with [[Viacom Media Networks|MTV Networks]].<ref name="wired-tanz" /><ref>{{cite news|title=A Guerrilla Video Site Meets MTV|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/19/business/media/19vice.html|access-date=29 February 2016|work=The New York Times}}</ref> VBS gained a fan base with shows like ''The Vice Guide To Travel'', ''Epicly Later'd'', ''Toxic'' and ''Hamilton's Pharmacopeia''.<ref>Simonini, Ross. "A Psychonaut's Adventures in Videoland", ''[[The New York Times]]'', 10 February 2012</ref> The documentaries on the channel featured unusual subjects, and were hosted by young people working at Vice Media, often the founders themselves.

In 2007, Vice Media began aggressively expanding its digital video operation, launching new channels, such as ''Motherboard'' (tech), ''Noisey'' (music), and ''The Creators Project,'' an arts/technology site founded in partnership with [[Intel]]. Vice Media would later launch sites around [[electronic music]] culture (''Thump''), global news (''Vice News''), food (''Munchies'') and sports (''Vice Sports''). Additionally, Vice Media launched Virtue Worldwide, a creative services agency, to expand their capabilities for work around their platforms.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://adage.com/article/teressa-iezzi/virtue-media-brand-vice-helps-marketers-tap-genius/135914/|title=With Virtue, Media Brand Vice Helps Marketers Tap Its Genius|access-date=31 March 2017|language=en}}</ref> During this time, Santiago Stelley was the director of content of VBS.tv (2006{{ndash}}2010) and creative director of Vice Media (2010{{ndash}}2012).<ref>Derrick, Lisa. "Vice TV: Revolutionary, Bold Pop Culture Explorations", ''[[The Huffington Post]]'', 12 November 2009</ref>

In January 2008 co-founder Gavin McInnes left Vice Media due to "creative differences" with the company,<ref name="auto1" /> and founded the website ''streetcarnage.com''. He later co-founded ''Rooster'', an advertising agency and became a far-right activist, founding the [[Proud Boys]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://roosternewyork.com/|title=Rooster – Cock-a-doodle-doo|website=roosternewyork.com|access-date=7 September 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180420060936/http://roosternewyork.com/|archive-date=20 April 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>

According to ''[[Columbia Journalism Review]]'', Vice has altered shots during the editing process in pursuit of more entertaining or impressive scenes. In a 2011 documentary on Libya, a voiceover from the reporter claim that he had gone to the frontlines amidst an offensive, while a source claims he did not make the trip, with only a cameraman going there.<ref name=":3" />

=== Ongoing history (2012–present) ===
In 2012, Vice Media continued to expand its coverage focused around news and current events.

With the end of VBS.tv, ''Vice'' began releasing films like ''UK's Scariest Debt Collector'', ''Swansea Love Story, World's Scariest Drug,'' and ''Inside the Superhuman World of the Iceman'' through their main website and [[YouTube]] channel, as well as new series like ''Slutever'', ''Fringes'', ''Love Industry'' and ''High Society.''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCn8zNIfYAQNdrFRrr8oibKw|title=VICE|website=YouTube|language=en|access-date=2019-03-29}}</ref>   Like previous ''Vice'' content, their online films and series almost always featured on-screen hosts such as [[Thomas Morton (journalist)|Thomas Morton]], [[Ryan Duffy (journalist)|Ryan Duffy]], [[Matt Shea (documentary filmmaker)|Matt Shea]], [[Karley Sciortino]], [[Charlet Duboc]], and Krishna Andavolu.

In mid-August 2013, [[Rupert Murdoch]]'s [[21st Century Fox]] invested US$70 million in Vice Media, resulting in a 5 percent stake. Following the announcement, Smith explained, "We have set ourselves up to build a global platform but we have maintained control."<ref>{{cite web|last1=Launder|first1=William|title=Vice Media Gets 21st Century Fox Cash|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2013/08/16/vice-media-gets-21st-century-fox-cash-infusion/|website=WSJ.com|publisher=Dow Jones & Company, Inc.|access-date=29 October 2014}}</ref>

In 2013 Vice Media premiered a new 30-minute news program for [[HBO]] titled ''Vice,'' executive produced by [[Bill Maher]]. In 2014, the second season of the show won a [[Creative Arts Emmy Award]] for Outstanding Informational Series or Special in the [[66th Primetime Creative Arts Emmy Awards]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Vice|url=http://www.emmys.com/shows/vice|website=Emmys.com|publisher=[[Academy of Television Arts & Sciences]]|access-date=29 October 2014}}</ref>

In 2014, Vice Media launched its news channel, [[Vice News]], which almost immediately gained global attention for its coverage of protests and conflict in [[Euromaidan|Ukraine]] and [[Venezuelan protests (2014–present)|Venezuela]]. As of October 2014, the editor of BBC Radio 1's Newsbeat claimed the BBC was "playing catch-up" to Vice News.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Plunkett|first1=John|title=BBC playing 'catch-up' with Vice News, says Newsbeat editor|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/oct/15/bbc-newsbeat-playing-catch-up-vice-news|website=TheGuardian.com|publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited|access-date=29 October 2014}}</ref>

Vice Media has routinely advocated for their "immersionist" brand of journalism in the pursuit of more authentic and interesting stories. Their founders and editors have regularly garnered controversy from the likes of ''[[The New York Times]]''{{'}} [[David Carr (journalist)|David Carr]], who bristled in an exchange with Shane Smith in the 2011 documentary ''[[Page One: Inside the New York Times]].'' In a 2014 ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' column, Carr said that ''Vice'' had since grown into a strong news entity. In August 2014, Carr published a ''New York Times'' column further reversing his earlier criticism of Vice, saying, "Being the crusty old-media scold felt good at the time, but recent events suggest that Vice is deadly serious about doing real news that people, yes, even young people, will actually watch."<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/25/business/media/its-edge-intact-vice-is-chasing-hard-news-.html|title=Its Edge Intact, Vice Is Chasing Hard News|last=Carr|first=David|date=24 August 2014|work=The New York Times|access-date=14 April 2017|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>

On 2 July 2014, Vice Media announced that it would be relocating into a warehouse space in Williamsburg formerly occupied by music venues 285 Kent, [[Death By Audio|Death by Audio]], and [[Glasslands Gallery|Glasslands]]. Vice spent US$20 million to renovate the {{convert|60000|sqft|adj=on}} building as part of an eight-year lease,<ref>{{cite web|author1=Jordan Sargent|title=No One Wants To Say It, But Vice Is Displacing Brooklyn Institutions|url=http://gawker.com/no-one-wants-to-say-it-but-vice-is-displacing-brooklyn-1649005022|website=Gawker|publisher=Gawker|access-date=8 November 2014|date=22 October 2014}}</ref> facilitating the establishment of new production facilities with full broadcast capabilities, and received an offer of US$6.5 million in tax credits from New York state's Empire State Development.<ref>{{cite web|author1=Mark Fahey|title=Vice Media grows in Brooklyn|url=http://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20140702/TECHNOLOGY/140709976/vice-media-grows-in-brooklyn|website=Crain's|publisher=Crains Communications Inc|access-date=8 November 2014|date=2 July 2014}}</ref>

In August 2014, [[A&E Networks]], a television group jointly owned by [[The Walt Disney Company]] and [[Hearst Communications|Hearst Corporation]], made a US$250-million investment in Vice Media for an ownership stake of 10%.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/a-e-networks-buying-minority-729183|title=A&E Networks Buying Minority Stake in Vice Media|work=The Hollywood Reporter|access-date=23 May 2017|language=en}}</ref> In November and December 2015, Disney made two additional individual investments of US$200 million totalling $400 million.<ref name="DisneyInvestsinVICE" /><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-12-08/disney-said-to-double-investment-in-vice-media-to-400-million|title=Disney Doubles Investment in Vice Media to $400 Million|date=8 December 2015|work=Bloomberg.com|access-date=23 May 2017}}</ref>

On 26 March 2015, HBO announced it would renew its contract to broadcast the weekly ''Vice'' documentary series for four years, while expanding the annual broadcast schedule from 14 to nearly 30 episodes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2015/03/26/vice-and-hbo-announce-content-partnership.html|title=Vice to launch daily news show for HBO|last=Boorstin|first=Julia|date=26 March 2015|website=CNBC|access-date=31 March 2017}}</ref> The network also announced Vice would be launching a nightly news program. The show, entitled ''Vice News Tonight'', premiered 10 October 2016 and was planned to run 48 weeks each year, featuring pre-edited video and graphics segments covering global news, technology, the environment, economics and pop culture, while eschewing the use of live TV anchors.<ref name="VICENewsTonightPostponesLauch" /><ref name="VICENewscastsnet" /><ref name=":0" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2017/03/22/521135567/vice-news-tonight-seeks-to-reinvent-tv-news-for-millennials|title='Vice News Tonight' Seeks To Reinvent TV News For Millennials|website=NPR.org|access-date=14 June 2017}}</ref>

In addition, over twenty other women stated that they had experienced or witnessed sexual misconduct, including unwanted kisses, groping, lewd remarks and propositions for sex, at the company.

==Unionization==
On 7 August 2015, the roughly 70-person writing staff of Vice Media US voted to unionize, joining the [[Writers Guild of America, East|Writers Guild of America]], East. Vice management quickly recognized the union. The successful union drive followed in the footsteps of [[Salon (website)|Salon]], [[Gawker]], and ''[[The Guardian]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://fortune.com/2015/08/07/vice-media-union/|title=Vice Media editorial staff vote to join the Writers Guild|website=Fortune|access-date=5 April 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/vice-media-unionizes_us_55c4fb62e4b0f1cbf1e4f4e9|title=Vice Media Votes To Unionize As Trend In Digital Media Continues|last=Calderone|first=Michael|date=7 August 2015|work=Huffington Post|access-date=5 April 2017|language=en-US}}</ref>

Then, in September 2017, employees and freelancers who "work on video content for Vice.com, cable channel Viceland, and Vice programming on HBO" unionized through Writers Guild of America, East and the [[Motion Picture Editors Guild|Motion Pictures Editors Guild]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/vice-medias-video-employees-unionize-1506022931|title=Vice Media's Video Employees Unionize|last=Alpert|first=Lukas I.|date=21 September 2017|work=Wall Street Journal|access-date=29 September 2017|language=en-US|issn=0099-9660}}</ref> At the time, a leader from one of the unions said, "We have built a constructive relationship with Vice management and applaud the company for continuing to respect the right of its employees to engage in collective bargaining."<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2017/digital/news/vice-media-unionization-writers-guild-editors-guild-1202565117/|title=Vice Media Video Employees Unionize With Writers Guild East and Editors Guild|last=McNary|first=Dave|date=21 September 2017|work=Variety|access-date=29 September 2017|language=en-US}}</ref>

On 2 May 2017, Vice Media ratified a three-year collective bargaining agreement with 170 employees of the company's Canadian division who had joined the Canadian Media Guild union in 2016.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/vice-union-collective-agreement-ratified-1.4093498|title=Vice Canada workers ratify collective agreement as digital journalists turn to unions|work=CBC News|access-date=12 June 2017|language=en}}</ref>

In February 2016, staff members at Vice UK called for [[unionization]] with an officially recognised trade union by the [[National Union of Journalists]]. Staff members said this was following the steps of Vice US (which unionized with the [[Writers Guild of America, East]]<ref>{{cite news|last1=Warren|first1=James|title=VICE workers decide they need a union|url=http://www.poynter.org/2015/vice-workers-decide-they-need-a-union/364395/|access-date=17 May 2016|work=Poynter|date=10 August 2015|language=en-US}}</ref>), in order to allow the staff to "share in the success of the company", to strengthen [[job security]] by Vice providing better contracts, to address "pay issues ... so everyone gets a fair deal, including freelancers" and enhance career progression opportunities.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Sweney|first1=Mark|title=Vice UK staff move to unionise to 'share in the success' of media company|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/feb/08/vice-uk-staff-unionise-share-success-media-company|access-date=17 May 2016|work=The Guardian|date=8 February 2016}}</ref>

This proposition was rejected by Vice UK; the company refused to recognise the [[National Union of Journalists]] but instead said that they were free to set up an internal staff council. Vice chief executive, Matt Elek, claimed the NUJ had displayed "a concerning lack of transparency from them about who they are purporting to represent here [and had] not been able to provide us with any numbers to demonstrate the degree of support they have in this office", adding that: "The NUJ are used to working with old print media businesses and structures – they are not used to innovative, digital workplaces like this where the culture has always been to encourage flexibility and allow people work across different departments."<ref>{{cite news|last1=Jackson|first1=Jasper|last2=Martinson|first2=Jane|title=Vice UK rejects call for union recognition|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/apr/27/vice-uk-union-recognition-nuj|access-date=17 May 2016|work=The Guardian|date=27 April 2016}}</ref>

In response, Michelle Stanistreet (General Secretary of the [[National Union of Journalists]]) said:

<blockquote>The accusation that the NUJ has not been transparent in its discussions with Vice management is simply untrue. It's a shame that the company has proven so resistant to listening to its own staff and facilitating what they want – a collective voice at work. That the NUJ and its 30,000 members – including those at Vice – are not used to the reality of a digital workforce is laughable and shows it's the company who are out of date with 21st century trade unions. Rejecting calls for union recognition from their own journalists and then trying to fob them off with a [[Rupert Murdoch]]-style staff association is a pretty old-fashioned union-busting ruse that misses the point. NUJ officials and reps at Vice will continue with the push for recognition and if the company wants that to be gained through the law forcing their hand rather than through sensible engagement with their staff, so be it.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Stanistreet|first1=Michelle|title=Trade union recognition at Vice UK|url=https://www.nuj.org.uk/news/vice-recognition-update/|access-date=19 May 2016|work=National Union of Journalists|date=27 April 2016}}</ref></blockquote>

==Office expansion in Brooklyn==
{{stack|float=right|[[File:55 Washington Street, Brooklyn NY.jpg|thumb|left|Vice Media expanded its offices to 55 Washington Street in [[Dumbo, Brooklyn]]]]}}
In July 2014, Vice Media announced it would be moving its headquarters to a new building in [[Williamsburg, Brooklyn]], where their New York office had been since 1999. According to an article in ''The Wall Street Journal'', the move would allow them to double their current office size and hire about 500 new employees.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/vice-media-moving-to-new-williamsburg-headquarters-1404315035|title=Vice Media Moving to New Williamsburg Headquarters|author=Laura Kusisto|date=3 July 2014|work=WSJ}}</ref>

Following this announcement, the two music venues occupying the building, [[Glasslands Gallery]] and [[Death By Audio]], soon announced the news they would be closing. Following the announcement from Glasslands management in October 2014 that the arts venue would close at the end of 2014, thereby making it the third Williamsburg music space to close through Vice Media's expansion—alongside 285 Kent and Death By Audio—''Big Shot Magazine'' claimed that the Brooklyn music community had received a "proverbial kick in the groin."<ref>{{cite web|author1=Darren Ressler|title=Gentrification Blues: Williamsburg's Glasslands is Closing|url=http://newsflash.bigshotmag.com/news/31956/|website=Big Shot Magazine|publisher=Big Shot Magazine|access-date=8 November 2014|date=23 October 2014}}</ref>

After a series of articles covering the venues' eviction, [[BrooklynVegan]] reported on the deals that led to Vice Media moving into the new office, including terms buying out tenants and covering past overdue rent, that contradicted some press around the renovation of the building and Vice Media's dealings with the current tenants. Regardless, as the article puts it, "The concept of 'Vice vs. DIY' in Williamsburg is officially a thing."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brooklynvegan.com/archives/2014/12/death_by_audio_11.html|title=Death By Audio booker talks Vice; Vice & the landlord respond|work=brooklynvegan.com}}</ref>

After expanding into the Glasslands Gallery and Death by Audio space in 2014, Vice further expanded its Brooklyn footprint by leasing a 74,000 square foot property at 55 Washington Street. The new property houses agency acquisitions Carrot Creative along with other Vice corporate staff.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ny.curbed.com/2016/10/24/13383654/vice-media-dumbo-expansion|title=Vice Media expands its hold on Brooklyn with new Dumbo office|date=24 October 2016|website=Curbed NY|access-date=5 April 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://commercialobserver.com/2016/10/vice-and-its-subsidiary-taking-over-two-trees-55-washington-street/|title=Vice and Its Subsidiary Taking Over Two Tree's 55 Washington Street|date=21 October 2016|work=Commercial Observer|access-date=5 April 2017|language=en-US}}</ref>
