==Media disclosure of PRISM==
{{Further|Global surveillance disclosure}}

PRISM was publicly revealed when classified documents about the program were leaked to journalists of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' and ''[[The Guardian]]'' by [[Edward Snowden]]{{spaced ndash}} at the time an NSA contractor{{spaced ndash}} during a visit to [[Hong Kong]].<ref name="WaPo1" /><ref name="Greenwald1" /> The leaked documents included 41 [[Microsoft PowerPoint|PowerPoint slides]], four of which were published in news articles.<ref name="WaPo1" /><ref name="Greenwald1" />

The documents identified several technology companies as participants in the PRISM program, including [[Microsoft]] in 2007, [[Yahoo!]] in 2008, [[Google]] in 2009, [[Facebook]] in 2009, [[Paltalk]] in 2009, [[YouTube]] in 2010, [[AOL]] in 2011, [[Skype]] in 2011 and [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] in 2012.<ref name="usa1">{{cite news |author1=Johnson, Kevin |author2=Martin, Scott |author3=O'Donnell, Jayne |author4=Winter, Michael |title=Reports: NSA Siphons Data from 9 Major Net Firms |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2013/06/06/nsa-surveillance-internet-companies/2398345/ |accessdate=June 6, 2013 |work=USA Today |date=June 15, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130607113440/http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2013/06/06/nsa-surveillance-internet-companies/2398345/ |archive-date=June 7, 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref> The speaker's notes in the briefing document reviewed by ''The Washington Post'' indicated that "98 percent of PRISM production is based on Yahoo, Google, and Microsoft".<ref name="WaPo1" />

The slide presentation stated that much of the world's electronic communications pass through the U.S., because electronic communications data tend to follow the least expensive route rather than the most physically direct route, and the bulk of the world's internet infrastructure is based in the United States.<ref name="wp_slides" /> The presentation noted that these facts provide United States intelligence analysts with opportunities for intercepting the communications of foreign targets as their electronic data pass into or through the United States.<ref name="Greenwald1" /><ref name="wp_slides" />

Bush Administration]] but was widely criticized and challenged as illegal, because it did not include warrants obtained from the [[Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court]].<ref name="SS1">{{cite web|last=Lundin|first=Leigh|title=Pam, Prism, and Poindexter|url=http://www.sleuthsayers.org/2013/07/pam-prism-and-poindexter.html|work=Spying|publisher=SleuthSayers|accessdate=January 4, 2014|date=7 July 2013|location=Washington|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140104063848/http://www.sleuthsayers.org/2013/07/pam-prism-and-poindexter.html|archive-date=January 4, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="Dean1">{{cite web | author = Dean, John W. | url = http://writ.corporate.findlaw.com/dean/20051230.html | title = George W.

PRISM was enabled under [[George W. Bush|President Bush]] by the [[Protect America Act of 2007]] and by the [[Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 Amendments Act of 2008|FISA Amendments Act of 2008]], which immunizes private companies from legal action when they cooperate with U.S. government agencies in intelligence collection.

The most detailed description of the PRISM program can be found in a report about NSA's collection efforts under Section 702 FAA, that was released by the [[Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board]] (PCLOB) on July 2, 2014.<ref name="pclob">Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board, {{cite web|url=http://www.pclob.gov/library/702-Report.pdf|title=Report on the Surveillance Program Operated Pursuant to Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act|date=July 2, 2014|website=pclob.gov|access-date=February 19, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150218223115/http://www.pclob.gov/library/702-Report.pdf|archive-date=February 18, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>

According to this report, PRISM is only used to collect internet communications, not telephone conversations. These internet communications are not collected in bulk, but in a targeted way: only communications that are to or from specific selectors, like e-mail addresses, can be gathered. Under PRISM, there's no collection based upon keywords or names.<ref name="pclob" />

The actual collection process is done by the [[Data Intercept Technology Unit]] (DITU) of the FBI, which on behalf of the NSA sends the selectors to the U.S. internet service providers, which were previously served with a Section 702 Directive. Under this directive, the provider is legally obliged to hand over (to DITU) all communications to or from the selectors provided by the government.<ref name="pclob" /> DITU then sends these communications to NSA, where they are stored in various databases, depending on their type.

Data, both content and metadata, that already have been collected under the PRISM program, may be searched for both US and non-US person identifiers. These kinds of queries became known as "back-door searches" and are conducted by NSA, FBI and CIA.<ref>{{cite news|work=TechDirt|url=https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20140630/12101627734/fbi-cia-also-make-use-backdoor-searches-nsa-data-to-access-us-communications-without-warrant.shtml|title=FBI, CIA Use Backdoor Searches To Warrentlessly Spy On Americans' Communications|date=June 30, 2014|access-date=February 19, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150219070214/https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20140630/12101627734/fbi-cia-also-make-use-backdoor-searches-nsa-data-to-access-us-communications-without-warrant.shtml|archive-date=February 19, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> Each of these agencies has slightly different protocols and safeguards to protect searches with a US person identifier.<ref name="pclob" />

===Extent of the program===
Internal NSA presentation slides included in the various media disclosures show that the NSA could unilaterally access data and perform "extensive, in-depth surveillance on live communications and stored information" with examples including email, video and voice chat, videos, photos, voice-over-IP chats (such as [[Skype]]), file transfers, and social networking details.<ref name="Greenwald1" /> Snowden summarized that "in general, the reality is this: if an NSA, FBI, CIA, DIA, etc. analyst has access to query raw [[SIGINT]] [signals intelligence] databases, they can enter and get results for anything they want."<ref name="ibtimes 17 june" />

According to ''The Washington Post'', the intelligence analysts search PRISM data using terms intended to identify suspicious communications of targets whom the analysts suspect with at least 51 percent confidence to not be U.S. citizens, but in the process, communication data of some U.S. citizens are also collected unintentionally.<ref name="WaPo1" /> Training materials for analysts tell them that while they should periodically report such accidental collection of non-foreign U.S. data, "it's nothing to worry about."<ref name="WaPo1" /><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/special/politics/prism-collection-documents/|title=NSA slides explain the PRISM data-collection program|date=July 10, 2013|access-date=September 7, 2017|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6OHdX5Sif?url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/special/politics/prism-collection-documents/|archive-date=March 23, 2014|url-status=live}} An annotated presentation of the NSA PRISM program as published by the Washington Post on 6 June 2013 and updated on 10 July 2013</ref>

According to ''[[The Guardian]]'', NSA had access to chats and emails on Hotmail.com and Skype because Microsoft had "developed a surveillance capability to deal" with the interception of chats, and "for Prism collection against Microsoft email services will be unaffected because Prism collects this data prior to encryption."<ref name="Greenwald2">{{cite news|author=[[Glenn Greenwald]], Ewen MacAskill, Laura Poitras, Spencer Ackerman and Dominic Rushe|title=Revealed: how Microsoft handed the NSA access to encrypted messages|work=[[The Guardian]]|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/11/microsoft-nsa-collaboration-user-data|accessdate=July 11, 2013|date=July 11, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151119014627/http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/11/microsoft-nsa-collaboration-user-data|archive-date=November 19, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Microsoft helped the NSA bypass encryption, new Snowden leak reveals|url=http://rt.com/usa/microsoft-nsa-snowden-leak-971/|publisher=Russia Today|accessdate=July 12, 2013|date=11 July 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130712010214/http://rt.com/usa/microsoft-nsa-snowden-leak-971/|archive-date=July 12, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/the-nsa-files|title=The NSA Files|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=June 8, 2013|access-date=December 12, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141003122712/http://www.theguardian.com/world/the-nsa-files|archive-date=October 3, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>

Also according to The Guardian's [[Glenn Greenwald]] even low-level NSA analysts are allowed to search and listen to the communications of Americans and other people without court approval and supervision. Greenwald said low level Analysts can, via systems like PRISM, "listen to whatever emails they want, whatever telephone calls, browsing histories, [[Microsoft Word]] documents.<ref name="SS2">{{cite web| last=Gates| first=David Edgerley| title=Through a Glass, Darkly| url=http://www.sleuthsayers.org/2013/06/through-glass-darkly.html| work=Spying| publisher=SleuthSayers| accessdate=January 4, 2014| location=Santa Fe| date=26 June 2013| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140125115912/http://www.sleuthsayers.org/2013/06/through-glass-darkly.html| archive-date=January 25, 2014| url-status=live}}</ref> And it's all done with no need to go to a court, with no need to even get supervisor approval on the part of the analyst."<ref name="ABCNews20130728" />

He added that the NSA databank, with its years of collected communications, allows analysts to search that database and listen "to the calls or read the emails of everything that the NSA has stored, or look at the browsing histories or Google search terms that you've entered, and it also alerts them to any further activity that people connected to that email address or that IP address do in the future."<ref name="ABCNews20130728">{{cite news|last=Rea|first=Kari|title=Glenn Greenwald: Low-Level NSA Analysts Have 'Powerful and Invasive' Search Tool|url=https://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2013/07/glenn-greenwald-low-level-nsa-analysts-have-powerful-and-invasive-search-tool/|accessdate=July 30, 2013|newspaper=ABC News|date=28 July 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130730024448/https://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2013/07/glenn-greenwald-low-level-nsa-analysts-have-powerful-and-invasive-search-tool/|archive-date=July 30, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> Greenwald was referring in the context of the foregoing quotes to the NSA program [[X-Keyscore]].<ref>{{cite news |author=Glenn Greenwald |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/31/nsa-top-secret-program-online-data |title=Revealed: NSA program collects 'nearly everything a user does on the internet' |work=Theguardian.com |date=31 July 2013 |accessdate=January 27, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131231025636/http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/31/nsa-top-secret-program-online-data |archive-date=December 31, 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref>

"While other nations' data protection authorities have the legal power to make binding orders, levy hefty fines and take meaningful action in the event of serious data breaches, we are restricted to a 'soft' approach: persuasion, encouragement and, at the most, the potential to publish the names of transgressors in the public interest."

''New York Times'' columnist [[Thomas L. Friedman]] defended limited government surveillance programs intended to protect the American people from terrorist acts:

<blockquote>Yes, I worry about potential government abuse of privacy from a program designed to prevent another 9/11—abuse that, so far, does not appear to have happened. But I worry even more about another 9/11. ... If there were another 9/11, I fear that 99 percent of Americans would tell their members of Congress: "Do whatever you need to do to, privacy be damned, just make sure this does not happen again."

==Legal aspects==
===Applicable law and practice===
On June 8, 2013, the [[Director of National Intelligence]] issued a fact sheet stating that PRISM "is not an undisclosed collection or data mining program," but rather "an internal government computer system" used to facilitate the collection of foreign intelligence information "under court supervision, as authorized by Section 702 of the [[Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act]] (FISA) (50 U.S.C. § 1881a)."<ref name="Fact Sheet" /> Section 702 provides that "the [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] and the Director of National Intelligence may authorize jointly, for a period of up to 1 year from the effective date of the authorization, the targeting of persons reasonably believed to be located outside the United States to acquire foreign intelligence information."<ref name="Section 702">{{cite web | publisher = Cornell | url = https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/50/1881a | work = US Code | title = Title 50, section 1881a.

After receiving a FISA Court order or determining that there are emergency circumstances, the attorney general and Director of National Intelligence can direct an electronic communication service provider to give them access to information or facilities to carry out the targeting and keep the targeting secret.<ref name="Section 702" /> The provider then has the option to: (1) comply with the directive; (2) reject it; or (3) challenge it with the FISA Court. If the provider complies with the directive, it is released from liability to its users for providing the information and is reimbursed for the cost of providing it,<ref name="Section 702" /> while if the provider rejects the directive, the attorney general may request an order from the FISA Court to enforce it.<ref name="Section 702" /> A provider that fails to comply with the FISA Court's order can be punished with [[contempt of court]].<ref name="Section 702" />

Finally, a provider can petition the FISA Court to reject the directive.<ref name="Section 702" /> In case the FISA Court denies the petition and orders the provider to comply with the directive, the provider risks contempt of court if it refuses to comply with the FISA Court's order.<ref name="Section 702" /> The provider can appeal the FISA Court's denial to the [[United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of Review|Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of Review]] and then appeal the Court of Review's decision to the [[US Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] by a [[writ of certiorari]] for review [[under seal]].<ref name="Section 702" />

===Analysis of legal issues===
Laura Donohue, a law professor at the [[Georgetown University Law Center]] and its [[Center on National Security and the Law]], has called PRISM and other NSA mass surveillance programs unconstitutional.<ref name="donohue">{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/nsa-surveillance-may-be-legal--but-its-unconstitutional/2013/06/21/b9ddec20-d44d-11e2-a73e-826d299ff459_story.html|title=NSA Surveillance May Be Legal – But It's Unconstitutional|first=Laura K.|last=Donohue| work = [[The Washington Post]] |date=June 21, 2013 |accessdate=June 29, 2013}}</ref>

Woodrow Hartzog, an affiliate at [[Stanford Law School]]'s [[Stanford Center for Internet and Society|Center for Internet and Society]] commented that "[The ACLU will] likely have to demonstrate legitimate First Amendment harms (such as [[Chilling effect (law)|chilling effects]]) or Fourth Amendment harms (perhaps a violation of a reasonable expectation of privacy) ... Is it a harm to merely know with certainty that you are being monitored by the government? There's certainly an argument that it is. People under surveillance act differently, experience a loss of autonomy, are less likely to engage in self exploration and reflection, and are less willing to engage in core expressive political activities such as dissenting speech and government criticism. Such interests are what First and Fourth Amendment seek to protect."<ref>Dwoskin, Elizabeth (June 13, 2013).

Parallel programs, known collectively as [[SIGAD]]s gather data and [[metadata]] from other sources, each SIGAD has a set of defined sources, targets, types of data collected, legal authorities, and software associated with it. Some SIGADs have the same name as the umbrella under which they sit, BLARNEY's (the SIGAD) summary, set down in the slides alongside a cartoon insignia of a shamrock and a leprechaun hat, describes it as "an ongoing collection program that leverages IC [intelligence community] and commercial partnerships to gain access and exploit foreign intelligence obtained from global networks."

Some SIGADs, like PRISM, collect data at the [[internet service provider|ISP]] level, but others take it from the top-level infrastructure. This type of collection is known as "upstream". Upstream collection includes programs known by the blanket terms [[Blarney (code name)|BLARNEY]], FAIRVIEW, [[OAKSTAR]] and [[STORMBREW]], under each of these are individual [[SIGAD]]s. Data that is integrated into a SIGAD can be gathered in other ways besides upstream, and from the service providers, for instance it can be collected from passive sensors around embassies, or even stolen from an individual computer network in a hacking attack.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite news|last=Ball|first=James|title=NSA's Prism surveillance program: how it works and what it can do|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/08/nsa-prism-server-collection-facebook-google|accessdate=July 11, 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=8 June 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130731013812/http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/08/nsa-prism-server-collection-facebook-google|archive-date=July 31, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="WPSlide20130710">{{cite news|last=Timberg|first=Craig|title=The NSA slide you haven't seen|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/the-nsa-slide-you-havent-seen/2013/07/10/32801426-e8e6-11e2-aa9f-c03a72e2d342_story.html|accessdate=July 11, 2013|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=10 Jul 2013|archive-url=http://www.webcitation.org/6I0nSSKV5?url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/the%2Dnsa%2Dslide%2Dyou%2Dhavent%2Dseen/2013/07/10/32801426%2De8e6%2D11e2%2Daa9f%2Dc03a72e2d342_story.html|archive-date=July 10, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=autogenerated3>{{cite news |title=Agreements with private companies protect U.S. access to cables' data for surveillance |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/technology/agreements-with-private-companies-protect-us-access-to-cables-data-for-surveillance/2013/07/06/aa5d017a-df77-11e2-b2d4-ea6d8f477a01_story.html |newspaper=The Washington Post|date=6 July 2013 |author1=Craig Timberg  |author2=Ellen Nakashima  |name-list-style=amp |accessdate=April 10, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Lindemann|first=Todd|title=A connected world|url=https://apps.washingtonpost.com/g/page/business/a-connected-world/305/|accessdate=February 12, 2014|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=6 July 2013}}</ref><ref name="NYBookReview20130729">{{cite magazine|last=Bamford|first=James|title=They Know Much More Than You Think|magazine=The New York Review of Books|accessdate=July 29, 2013|date=12 July 2013|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2013/aug/15/nsa-they-know-much-more-you-think/?pagination=false|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130727212122/http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2013/aug/15/nsa-they-know-much-more-you-think/?pagination=false|archive-date=July 27, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>

A second track of information gathering was revealed by the Guardian and the Washington Post in June and July 2013.<ref name=autogenerated1 /><ref name="WPSlide20130710" /> The second track called "Upstream" is accessing "communications on fiber cables and infrastructure as data flows past."<ref name="WPSlide20130710" /> Upstream is broad-based surveillance of fiber-optic networks and cables which are carrying torrents of data at the speed of light.<ref name=autogenerated3 /> Through UPSTREAM the NSA does get direct access to fiber-optic cables and the supporting infrastructure that carries nearly all the internet and telephone traffic in the USA.<ref name="NYBookReview20130729" /> The interaction between Upstream and PRISM—which could be considered "downstream" collection because the data is already processed by tech companies—is not entirely clear, but according to an NSA slide the two collection methods operate in parallel, instructing analysts that "You Should Use Both." Arrows point to both "Upstream" and "PRISM" in the NSA slide.<ref name="WPSlide20130710" />
