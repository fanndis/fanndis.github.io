'''''Music of the Sun''''' is the debut [[studio album]] by Barbadian singer [[Rihanna]]. It was released on August 29, 2005, by [[Def Jam Recordings]]. Prior to signing with Def Jam, Rihanna was discovered by record producer [[Carl Sturken and Evan Rogers|Evan Rogers]] in Barbados, who helped Rihanna record [[Demo (music)|demo tapes]] to send out to several record labels. [[Jay-Z]], the former [[chief executive officer]] (CEO) and president of Def Jam, was given Rihanna's demo by Jay Brown, his [[Artists and repertoire|A&R]] at Def Jam, and invited her to audition for the label after hearing what turned out to be her first single, "[[Pon de Replay]]". She auditioned for Jay-Z and [[L.A. Reid]], the former CEO and president of record label group [[The Island Def Jam Music Group]], and was signed on the spot to prevent her from signing with another record label.

After Rihanna was signed by Jay-Z, she continued to work with Rogers and his production partner [[Carl Sturken and Evan Rogers|Carl Sturken]], as well as other music producers such as [[Trackmasters|Poke and Tone]], [[Supa Dups|D. "Supa Dups" Chin-quee]] and [[Stargate (music producers)|Stargate]]. ''Music of the Sun'' features vocals from [[Canada|Canadian]] rapper [[Kardinal Offishall]], music group [[J-Status]], and [[Jamaica]]n singer [[Vybz Kartel]]. Its music incorporates [[Caribbean music]] such as [[dancehall]] and [[reggae]], as well as [[dance-pop]] and [[contemporary R&B|R&B]] ballads.

''Music of the Sun'' received generally mixed reviews from music critics, some of whom complimented its dancehall and [[Caribbean]]-inspired songs, while others criticized some of the production. Commercially, the album was a modest success, debuting at number ten on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and number six on the US [[Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums]]. In addition, it peaked within the top 40 of album charts in Germany, New Zealand, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. It produced two singles &ndash; "[[Pon de Replay]]" and "[[If It's Lovin' that You Want]]" &ndash; the former of which peaked at number two on the US ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]] and number one on the US [[Dance Club Songs]]. ''Music of the Sun'' was certified [[RIAA certification|Platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA). Rihanna promoted the album along with her [[A Girl Like Me (Rihanna album)|next release]] with her debut concert tour, [[Rihanna: Live in Concert]].

==Background==
[[File:Whitney Houston Welcome Heroes 7 cropped.JPEG|thumb|left|upright=0.75|Prior to signing a record deal with [[Def Jam Recordings|Def Jam]], Rihanna performed a cover of [[Whitney Houston]]'s "[[For the Love of You]]" for then Def Jam chairman [[Jay-Z]].<ref name="TheGuardian1"/>]]
Before signing to [[Def Jam Recordings]], Rihanna was discovered in her home country [[Barbados]] by [[United States|American]] record producer [[Carl Sturken and Evan Rogers|Evan Rogers]]. The two met in December 2003 through mutual friends of Rihanna's and Rogers' wife, while the couple was on vacation in Barbados. After meeting for the first time, Rogers asked Rihanna to come to his hotel room, where she performed renditions of [[Destiny's Child]]'s "[[Emotion (Samantha Sang song)#Emotion (Samantha Sang song)|Emotion]]" and [[Mariah Carey]]'s "[[Hero (Mariah Carey song)|Hero]]". Rihanna's renditions impressed Rogers, who then took her to [[New York City]], where she was accompanied by her mother to record some [[Demo (music)|demo]] tapes which could be sent to [[record labels]].<ref name="TheGuardian1">{{cite news|last=Patterson|first=Sylvia|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/aug/26/popandrock|title=Singing in the rain|work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=Guardian News and Media|date=August 27, 2007|accessdate=September 24, 2011|location=London}}</ref> She recorded the demo over the next year intermittently, due to Rihanna only being able to record during school holidays.

At the age of 16, Rihanna was signed to Rogers' and [[Carl Sturken and Evan Rogers|Carl Sturken]]'s production company, Syndicated Rhythm Productions, who assigned her a [[lawyer]] and [[talent manager|manager]], before the completed demo tape was distributed to various record labels around the world in late 2004. The first to respond to the demo tape was [[Jay-Z]], who had recently been appointed as president and CEO of Def Jam Recordings. Rihanna auditioned for him and music mogul [[L.A. Reid]] in his office.<ref name="TheGuardian1"/><ref name="USAToday1">{{cite news|last=Jones|first=Steve|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/music/news/2005-08-01-otv-rihanna_x.htm|title=Rihanna has her day in the sun|work=[[USA Today]]|publisher=[[Gannett Company]]|date=August 1, 2005|accessdate=May 23, 2009}}</ref> Looking back on the audition and meeting Jay-Z, Rihanna explained in an interview how she felt before walking into the room, saying: "That's when I really got nervous..... I was like: 'Oh God, he's right there, I can't look, I can't look, I can't look!' I remember being extremely quiet. I was very shy. I was cold the entire time. I had butterflies. I'm sitting across from Jay-Z. Like, Jay-Zee. I was star-struck."<ref name="TheGuardian1"/> During the audition, Rihanna performed [[Whitney Houston]]'s cover of "[[For the Love of You]]", as well as "[[Pon de Replay]]" and "The Last Time", which were written and produced by Rogers and Sturken and would be included on her debut album ''Music of the Sun''.<ref name="TheGuardian1"/>

Jay-Z was initially skeptical about signing Rihanna after he felt "Pon de Replay" was too big for her, saying "when a song is that big, it's hard [for a new artist] to come back from. I don't sign songs, I sign artists".<ref name="Jay-ZPicks">{{cite web|last=Reid |first=Shaheem |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/yhif/jayz_picks/ |title=Jay-Z's Picks: Teairra Mari, Rihanna, Ne-Yo |work=[[MTV]] |publisher=[[Viacom (2005â€“present)|Viacom]] |accessdate=September 24, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110830053302/http://www.mtv.com/news/yhif/jayz_picks/ |archivedate=August 30, 2011 }}</ref> The audition resulted in Rihanna signing a six-album record deal with Def Jam Recordings in February 2005, on the same day of the audition, with Jay-Z saying "There's only two ways out. Out the door after you sign this deal. Or through this window ...", meaning that he was not going to let her leave without signing a record deal.<ref name="TheGuardian1"/>

After signing to Def Jam Recordings, Rihanna cancelled other meetings with record labels and relocated from Barbados to [[New York City]] to live with Rogers and his wife.<ref name="RollingStone1">{{cite news|last=Eells|first=Josh|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/rihanna-queen-of-pain-rolling-stones-2011-cover-story-20110606?page=5|title=Rihanna, Queen of Pain: Rolling Stone's 2011 Cover Story|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|publisher=[[Jann Wenner|Wenner Media]]|date=June 1, 2011|accessdate=July 20, 2011}}</ref> Rihanna explained the concept behind the title of the album to Kidzworld, saying that the sun is representative of her native [[Caribbean]] culture as well as herself and that the album consists of music from her heritage.<ref name="Kidzworld">{{cite web|url=http://www.kidzworld.com/article/5853-rihanna-interview|title=Rihanna Interview|publisher=Kidzworld|accessdate=August 16, 2009}}</ref>

==Recording==
Rihanna worked with various [[record producer|producers]] for ''Music of the Sun'' and continued to work with [[Carl Sturken and Evan Rogers]], who had previously written and produced "[[Pon de Replay]]" and "The Last Time" for Rihanna's [[demo tape]]. Although Rihanna stated that when she first heard "Pon de Replay", she did not want to record it, expressing that she felt the song was "sing-songy", but grew to like the song at the end of the recording process.<ref name="ArtistDirect">{{cite web|url=http://www.artistdirect.com/nad/news/article/0,,3655378,00.html|title=Artist Directs Exclusive Interview With Rihanna!|publisher=[[Artistdirect]]|date=May 12, 2006|accessdate=December 13, 2011}}</ref> In an interview with Kidzworld, Rihanna learned how the pair helped her develop her song-writing abilities, talking about Rogers and Sturken, who had worked with [[recording artists]] including [[Britney Spears]], [[Christina Aguilera]] and [[Kelly Clarkson]].<ref name="Kidzworld"/>
