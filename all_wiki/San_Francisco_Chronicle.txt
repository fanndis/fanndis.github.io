The '''''San Francisco Chronicle''''' is a [[newspaper]] serving primarily the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] of northern [[California]]. It was founded in 1865 as ''The Daily Dramatic Chronicle'' by teenage brothers [[Charles de Young]] and [[M. H. de Young|Michael H. de Young]].<ref name=Nolte>{{cite news |last=Nolte |first = Carl |author-link=Carl Nolte|title=134 Years of the Chronicle |work=San Francisco Chronicle |date=June 16, 1999 | url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/1999/06/16/noltehistory.DTL  | access-date=2006-09-21}}</ref> The paper is owned by the [[Hearst Corporation]], which bought it from the de Young family in 2000. It is the only major daily paper covering the city and county of San Francisco.

The paper benefited from the growth of [[San Francisco]] and had the largest [[newspaper circulation]] on the [[West Coast of the United States]] by 1880. Like other newspapers, it has experienced a rapid fall in circulation in the early [[21st century]] and was ranked 24th by circulation nationally for the six months to March 2010.

In 1994, the newspaper launched the SFGATE website, including both content from the paper and other sources. In 2013, the newspaper launched its own [[namesake]] website, SFChronicle.com, and began the separation of the SFGATE and Chronicle brands, which today are two separately run entities.

==History==
The ''Chronicle'' was founded by brothers [[Charles de Young|Charles]] and [[M. H. de Young]] in 1865 as ''The Daily Dramatic Chronicle'',<ref name=Nolte/> funded by a borrowed $20 gold piece. Their brother Gustavus was named with Charles on the masthead.<ref name=first>{{cite news |first=Charles |last=O'Rourke |url=https://www.sfchronicle.com/news/article/Chronicle-Covers-Our-inaugural-issue-6713535.php |title=Chronicle Covers: Our first issue was a 'dramatic' debut |newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle |date=January 16, 2016 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |first=Gray |last=Brechin |author-link=Gray Brechin |title=Imperial San Francisco: Urban Power, Earthly Ruin |year=2001 |orig-year=1999 |publisher=University of California |location=Berkeley |isbn=0-520-22902-9 |pages=172, 183 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lGJq8nWqY-oC&q=Gustavus }}</ref> Within 10 years, it had the largest circulation of any newspaper west of the [[Mississippi River]]. The paper's first office was in a building at the corner of Bush and [[Kearny Street|Kearney Streets]]. The brothers then commissioned a building from [[Burnham and Root]] at 690 [[Market Street (San Francisco)|Market Street]] at the corner of Third and Kearney Streets to be their new [[headquarters]], in what became known as [[Newspaper Row (San Francisco)|Newspaper Row]]. The new building, San Francisco's first [[skyscraper]], was completed in 1889.  It was damaged in the 1906 [[earthquake]], but it was rebuilt under the direction of William Polk, Burnham's associate in San Francisco. That building, known as the "Old ''Chronicle'' Building" or the "DeYoung Building", still stands and was restored in 2007. It is a historic landmark and is the location of the [[Ritz-Carlton Club and Residences]].<ref name=spur />

In 1924, the ''Chronicle'' commissioned a new headquarters at 901 [[Mission Street]] on the corner of 5th Street in what is now the South of Market (SoMa) neighborhood of San Francisco. It was designed by Charles Peter Weeks and William Peyton Day in the [[Gothic Revival architecture]] style, but most of the Gothic Revival detailing was removed in 1968 when the building was re-clad with stucco. This building remains the ''Chronicle''{{'}}s headquarters in 2017, although other concerns are located there as well.<ref name=spur />

Between [[World War II]] and 1971, new editor [[Scott Newhall]] took a bold and somewhat provocative approach to news presentation. Newhall's ''Chronicle'' included investigative reporting by such journalists as [[Pierre Salinger]], who later played a prominent role in national politics, and [[Paul Avery]], the staffer who pursued the trail of the self-named "[[Zodiac Killer]]", who sent a [[cryptogram]] in three sections in letters to the ''Chronicle'' and two other papers during his murder spree in the late 1960s.<ref>[http://www.zodiackiller.com/ChronicleCipher.html "Mailed: July 31, 1969, Postmarked: San Francisco, Calif. Sent to: ''San Francisco Chronicle'' Cipher Status: Solved]. zodiackiller.com. Retrieved 2012-11-18.</ref> It also featured such colorful [[columnist]]s as [[Pauline Phillips]], who wrote under the name "[[Dear Abby]]," "Count Marco" (Marc Spinelli), [[Stanton Delaplane]], Terence O'Flaherty, [[Lucius Beebe]], [[Art Hoppe]],  [[Charles McCabe]], and [[Herb Caen]].

The newspaper grew in circulation to become the city's largest, overtaking the rival ''[[San Francisco Examiner]]''. The demise of other San Francisco dailies through the late 1950s and early 1960s left the ''Examiner'' and the ''Chronicle'' to battle for circulation and readership superiority.

===Joint operating agreement===

The competition between the ''Chronicle'' and ''Examiner'' took a financial toll on both papers until the summer of 1965, when a merger of sorts created a [[Joint Operating Agreement|joint operating agreement]] under which the ''Chronicle'' became the city's sole morning daily while the ''Examiner'' changed to afternoon publication (which ultimately led to a declining readership).

The newspapers were officially owned by the San Francisco Newspaper Agency, which managed sales and distribution for both newspapers and was charged with ensuring that one newspaper's circulation did not grow at the expense of the other. [[Revenue]] was split equally, which led to a situation widely understood to benefit the ''Examiner'', since the ''Chronicle'', which had a circulation four times larger than its rival, subsidized the afternoon newspaper.<ref name="AJRBattle1">Gorney, Cynthia Gorney (January/February 1999). [http://www.ajr.org/Article.asp?id=3293 "The State of The American Newspaper – The Battle Of the Bay"]. ajr.org. ''[[American Journalism Review]]''. Retrieved 2012-11-17.</ref>

The two newspapers produced a joint Sunday edition, with the ''Examiner'' publishing the news sections and the Sunday magazine, and the ''Chronicle'' responsible for the [[tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid-sized]] entertainment section and the book review. From 1965 on the two papers shared a single classified-advertising operation. This arrangement stayed in place until the Hearst Corporation took full control of the ''Chronicle'' in 2000.

===Push into the suburbs===
[[File:Jack Breibart and Bill German.jpg|thumb|250px|Bill German (left), the ''Chronicle''{{'}}s editor emeritus, and Page One editor Jack Breibart in the newsroom, March 1994]]

Beginning in the early 1990s, the ''Chronicle'' began to face competition beyond the borders of San Francisco. The newspaper had long enjoyed a wide reach as the de facto "[[newspaper of record]]" in Northern California, with distribution along the Central Coast, the Inland Empire, and even as far as Honolulu, Hawaii. There was little competition in the Bay Area suburbs and other areas that the newspaper served, but as Knight-Ridder consolidated the ''[[The Mercury News|San Jose Mercury News]]'' in 1975; purchased the ''Contra Costa Times'' (now ''[[East Bay Times]]'') in 1995; and as the Denver-based [[Media News Group]] made a rapid purchase of the remaining newspapers on the East Bay by 1985, the ''Chronicle'' realized it had to step up its suburban coverage.

The ''Chronicle'' launched five zoned sections to appear in the Friday edition of the paper. The sections covered San Francisco and four different suburban areas. They each featured a unique columnist, enterprise pieces, and local news specific to the community. The newspaper added 40 full-time staff positions to work in the suburban bureaus. Despite the push to focus on suburban coverage, the ''Chronicle'' was hamstrung by the Sunday edition, which, being produced by the San Francisco-centric "un-''Chronicle''" ''Examiner'', had none of the focus on the suburban communities that the ''Chronicle'' was striving to cultivate.<ref name="AJRBattle2">{{cite news|url=http://www.ajr.org/Article.asp?id=3295|date=January–February 1999|title=Continuation of The Battle Of the Bay|first=Cynthia |last=Gorney|work=American Journalism Review|access-date=2012-11-17 }}</ref>

===Sale to Hearst===
The de Young family controlled the paper, via the [[Chronicle Publishing Company]], until July 27, 2000, when it was sold to [[Hearst Corporation|Hearst Communications, Inc.]], which owned the ''Examiner''. Following the sale, the Hearst Corporation transferred the ''Examiner'' to the Fang family, publisher of the ''[[San Francisco Independent]]'' and ''[[AsianWeek]]'', along with a $66-million subsidy.<ref name="subsidy">{{cite news|url=http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2003/02/22/BU70510.DTL|access-date=2007-07-29|work=San Francisco Chronicle |title=Examiner fires most of staff|last=Buchanan|first=Wyatt|date=February 22, 2003}}</ref> Under the new owners, the ''Examiner'' became a free [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]], leaving the ''Chronicle'' as the only daily [[broadsheet]] newspaper in San Francisco.

In 1949, the de Young family founded [[KRON-TV]] (Channel 4), the Bay Area's third television station. Until the mid-1960s, the station (along with KRON-FM), operated from the basement of the ''Chronicle'' Building, on Mission Street. KRON moved to studios at 1001 Van Ness Avenue (on the former site of St. Mary's Cathedral, which burned down in 1962). KRON was sold to [[Young Broadcasting]] in 2000 and, after years of being San Francisco's [[NBC]] affiliate, became an independent station on January 1, 2002, when NBC—tired of Chronicle's repeated refusal to sell KRON to the network and, later, Young's asking price for the station being too high<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/NBC-buys-KNTV-cuts-ties-to-KRON-Deal-affirms-2838310.php|title=NBC buys KNTV, cuts ties to KRON / Deal affirms Jan. 1 switch|last=Goodman|first=Tim|date=18 December 2001|work=San Francisco Chronicle|access-date=31 October 2014}}</ref>—purchased [[KNTV]] in San Jose from [[Granite Broadcasting Corporation]] for $230 million.<ref name="KNTV">{{cite news|url=http://articles.sfgate.com/2001-12-18/news/17632000_1_kron-nbc-television-stations-granite-broadcasting|work=San Francisco Chronicle |title=NBC buys KNTV, cuts ties to KRON / Deal affirms Jan. 1 switch |last=Goodman |first=Tim |date=December 18, 2001|access-date=2012-11-17}}</ref>

[[File:JOHNSIAS1999.jpg|thumb|250px|left|''Chronicle'' CEO John Sias announces the sale of the newspaper to the [[Hearst Corporation]], August 6, 1999.]]

Since the Hearst Corporation took ownership in 2000 the ''Chronicle'' has made periodic changes to its organization and design, but on February 1, 2009, as the newspaper began its 145th year of publication, the ''Chronicle'' Sunday edition introduced a redesigned paper featuring a modified logo, new section, and page organization, new features, bolder, colored section-front banners and new headline and text typography. The frequent bold-faced, all-capital-letter headlines typical of the ''Chronicle''{{'}}s front page were eliminated. Editor Ward Bushee's note heralded the issue as the start of a "new era" for the ''Chronicle''.

On July 6, 2009, the paper unveiled some alterations to the new design that included yet newer section fronts and wider use of color photographs and graphics. In a special section publisher, Frank J. Vega described new, state-of-the-art printing operations enabling the production of what he termed "A Bolder, Brighter ''Chronicle''."  The newer look was accompanied by a reduction in size of the broadsheet. Such moves are similar to those made by other prominent American newspapers such as the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' and ''[[Orlando Sentinel]]'', which in 2008 unveiled radically new designs even as changing reader demographics and general economic conditions necessitated physical reductions of the newspapers.

On November 9, 2009, the ''Chronicle'' became the first newspaper in the nation to print on high-quality glossy paper.<ref>"Chronicle goes glossy beginning Monday," ''San Francisco Chronicle'', November 4, 2009, p. A1.</ref> The high-gloss paper is used for some section fronts and inside pages.{{clear left}}

==Praise, criticism, and features==
The paper has received the [[Pulitzer Prize]] on a number of occasions. Despite an illustrious and long history, the paper's news reportage is not as extensive as in the past. The current day ''Chronicle'' has followed the trend of other American newspapers, devoting increasing attention to local and regional news and cultural and entertainment criticism to the detriment of the paper's traditionally strong national and international reporting, though the paper does maintain a Washington, D.C., bureau. This increased focus on local news is a response to the competition from other Bay Area newspapers including the resurrected ''[[San Francisco Examiner]]'', the ''[[Oakland Tribune]]'', the ''East Bay Times'' (formerly ''Contra Costa Times'' and the ''[[San Jose Mercury News]]''.

[[Lance Williams and Mark Fainaru-Wada]] received the [[George Polk Awards|2004 George Polk Award]] for Sports Reporting.<ref name="polk">{{cite web|url=http://www.brooklyn.liu.edu/polk/press/2005.html|title=George Polk Awards for Journalism press release |year=2005 |publisher=Long Island University |access-date=2006-11-22 }}</ref>  Fainaru-Wada and Williams were recognized for their work on uncovering the [[BALCO]] scandal, which linked [[San Francisco Giants]] star [[Barry Bonds]] to performance-enhancing drugs. While the two above-named reporters broke the news, they are by no means the only sports writers of note at the ''Chronicle''. The ''Chronicle''{{'}}s sports section, edited by Al Saracevic and called ''Sporting Green'' as it is printed on green-tinted pages, is staffed by a dozen writers. The section's best-known writers are its columnists: Bruce Jenkins, Ann Killion, Scott Ostler, Saracevic and Tom Stienstra. Its baseball coverage is anchored by Henry Schulman, John Shea, and [[Susan Slusser]], the first female president of the [[Baseball Writers' Association of America]] (BBWAA).

The ''Chronicle's'' Sunday arts and entertainment insert section is called ''Datebook'', and has for decades been printed on pink-tinted paper in a tabloid format. Movie reviews (for many years written by nationally known critic [[Mick LaSalle]]) feature a unique rating system: instead of stars or a "thumbs up" system, the ''Chronicle'' has for decades used a small cartoon icon, sitting in a movie theater seat, known as the "Little Man," explained in 2008 by the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' film critic [[Roger Ebert]]: "...the only rating system that makes any sense is the Little Man of the ''San Francisco Chronicle'', who is seen (1) jumping out of his seat and applauding wildly; (2) sitting up happily and applauding; (3) sitting attentively; (4) asleep in his seat; or (5) gone from his seat."<ref>{{Cite web|last=Ebert|first=Roger|date=September 14, 2008|title=You give out too many stars|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/roger-ebert/you-give-out-too-many-stars|access-date=2020-07-12|website=rogerebert.com (originally published at suntimes.com)|language=en}}</ref>

Another area of note is the architecture column by John King; the ''Chronicle'' is still one of the few American papers to present a regular column on architectural issues. The paper also has regular weekly sections devoted to Food & Home and Style.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}

==Challenges==
Circulation has fallen sharply since the [[dot-com bubble|dot-com boom]] peaked from around 1997 to 2001. The ''Chronicle''{{'}}s daily readership dropped by 16.6% between 2004 and 2005 to 400,906;<ref name="circulation">{{cite news |last=Abate |first=Tom |title=Circulation of U.S. weekday newspapers takes 2.6% hit Chronicle leads pack with 16.6% decline during 6-month period |work=San Francisco Chronicle |date=November 8, 2005 | url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2005/11/08/BUGSOFKG991.DTL&type=business |access-date=2007-01-05}}</ref> The ''Chronicle'' fired one quarter of its newsroom staff in a cost-cutting move in May 2007.<ref>{{cite news |last=Garofoli |first=Joe |title=Chronicle to cut 25% of jobs in newsroom |date=May 19, 2007 |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/05/19/BUGK0PTP8V1.DTL|access-date=2009-03-18 | work=The San Francisco Chronicle}}</ref> Newspaper executives pointed to growth of SFGate, the online website with 5.2 million unique visitors per month - fifth among U.S. newspaper websites in 2007.

In February 2009, Hearst chief executive Frank A. Bennack Jr., and Hearst President Steven R. Swartz, announced that the ''Chronicle'' had lost money every year since 2001 and more than $50 million in 2008. Without major concessions from employees and other cuts, Hearst would put the papers up for sale and if no buyer was found, shut the paper. San Francisco would have become the first major American city without a daily newspaper.<ref>[[Richard Pérez-Peña|Pérez-Peña, Richard]] (February 24, 2009). [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/25/business/media/25paper.html  "Hearst Threatens to End San Francisco Paper"]</ref> The cuts were made.

In spite of – or perhaps because of – the threats, the loss of readers and advertisers accelerated. On October 26, 2009, the Audit Bureau of Circulations reported that the ''Chronicle'' had suffered a 25.8% drop in circulation for the six-month period ending September 2009, to 251,782 subscribers, the largest percentage drop in circulation of any major newspaper in the United States.<ref name="circulation_oct_09">{{cite magazine |last=Saba |first=Jennifer |title=Newspapers Across the Country Show Steep Declines in Circulation, in New FAS-FAX |magazine=Editor & Publisher |date=October 26, 2009 |url=http://www.editorandpublisher.com/eandp/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1004030291 |access-date=2009-10-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091027140640/http://www.editorandpublisher.com/eandp/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1004030291 |archive-date=October 27, 2009 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> ''Chronicle'' publisher Frank Vega said the drop was expected as the paper moved to earn more from higher subscription fees from fewer readers.<ref name="circulation_oct_09_02">{{cite news |last=Baker |first=David |title=Chronicle's strategy shift starts to pay off |work=San Francisco Chronicle |date=October 26, 2009 |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2009/10/26/BUDV1AAV94.DTL |access-date=2009-10-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091030122658/http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=%2Fc%2Fa%2F2009%2F10%2F26%2FBUDV1AAV94.DTL# |archive-date=2009-10-30 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In May 2013, Vega retired and was replaced as publisher by former ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' publisher Jeffrey M.
