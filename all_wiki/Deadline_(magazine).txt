'''''Deadline''''' was a British comics magazine published between [[1988 in comics|1988]] and [[1995 in comics|1995]].  

Created by ''[[2000 AD (comics)|2000 AD]]'' artists [[Brett Ewins]] and [[Steve Dillon]], ''Deadline'' featured a mix of [[comic strips]] and written articles aimed at older readers. Although similar to the likes of ''[[Crisis (comic)|Crisis]]'', ''[[Revolver Comic (UK)|Revolver]]'' and ''[[Toxic!]]'' which emerged during the magazine's heyday, ''Deadline'' alone managed to sustain its impact beyond the first few issues and had a cultural influence beyond the comics world. Deadline was published by Deadline Publications Ltd.

==History==

The magazine's origins lie in the earlier publication ''Strange Days'', an anthology title created by Ewins, [[Brendan McCarthy]] and [[Peter Milligan]]. 

Much of the non-strip content centred on alternative and indie music. Coupled with the subversive nature of many of the comic strips, the magazine had a distinctive [[counterculture]] ethos and post-punk sensibility. 

The magazine was owned and financed by Tom Astor (grandson of [[Nancy Astor]]), and initially edited by Steve Dillon and Brett Ewins before transferring editorship to Dave Elliott, then [[Si Spencer]] and finally [[Frank Wynne]] (a former staff member of ''[[Crisis (comic)|Crisis]]'' and subsequently translator of [[Michel Houellebecq]]). Alongside original material, Alliott and Wynne also introduced reprints of American [[alternative comics]] such as ''[[Love and Rockets (comics)|Love and Rockets]]'', [[Bob Burden]]'s [[Flaming Carrot]] and [[Evan Dorkin]] strips such as ''[[Milk and Cheese]]''.  Elliott also arranged for content from the magazine to be reprinted in the [[United States|US]] by [[Dark Horse Comics]] as ''Deadline USA''.

''Deadline'' enjoyed the patronage of those who would not normally purchase comics and the support of several key bands of the time, with [[Blur (band)|Blur]] making regular appearances in the ''[[Tank Girl]]'' strips, and covers including [[Ride (band)|Ride]], [[Curve (band)|Curve]], [[Carter USM]] and the [[Senseless Things]].  However, the commercial failure of the ''[[Tank Girl (film)|Tank Girl]]'' film and the crossing over of the alternative scene into the mainstream (around the time of [[Britpop]], a movement it had helped to champion) saw the magazine eventually fold at the end of 1995. 

In the late 2000s, [[Alan Grant (writer)|Alan Grant]] edited the title ''Wasted'', which owed much to the style and ethos of ''Deadline'' a decade and a half earlier.
