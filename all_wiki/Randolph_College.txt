'''Randolph College''' is a [[Private university|private]] [[Liberal arts colleges in the United States|liberal arts and sciences college]] in [[Lynchburg, Virginia]]. Founded in 1891 as '''Randolph-Macon Woman's College''', it was renamed on July 1, 2007, when it became [[Mixed-sex education|coeducational]].

The college offers 32 majors; 42 minors; pre-professional programs in law, medicine, veterinary medicine, engineering physics, and teaching; and a dual degree program in engineering. Undergraduate degrees offered include the [[Bachelor of Arts]], [[Bachelor of Science]], and Bachelor of Fine Arts. Randolph also offers two graduate degrees, the [[Master of Arts in Teaching]] and Master of Fine Arts in Creative Writing.

Randolph College is an [[Division III (NCAA)|NCAA Division III]] school competing in the [[Old Dominion Athletic Conference]] (ODAC). The college fields varsity teams in six men's and eight women's sports. The coed riding team competed in both the ODAC and the [[Intercollegiate Horse Show Association]]. The recent decision to close the Riding Center currently leaves the fate of the team unclear, however.

Notable alumni include author [[Pearl S. Buck]], who won the [[Nobel Prize]] and [[Pulitzer Prize]], former [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] [[Blanche Lincoln]], and [[CNN]] senior political correspondent [[Candy Crowley]].

Randolph is a member of [[The Annapolis Group]] of colleges in the United States, the Council of Independent Colleges in Virginia, and the Virginia Foundation for Independent Colleges.

==History==
The college was founded by [[William Waugh Smith]], then-president of [[Randolph-Macon College]], under Randolph-Macon's charter after he failed to convince R-MC to become [[co-education]]al. Randolph-Macon Woman's College has historic ties to the [[United Methodist Church]]. After many attempts to find a location for Randolph-Macon Woman's College, the city of Lynchburg donated 50 acres<ref>{{cite news |title=Randolph-Macon Woman's College |url=https://archive.org/stream/independen79v80newy#page/n42/mode/1up |newspaper=The Independent |date=Jul 6, 1914 |accessdate=August 1, 2012}}</ref> for the purpose of establishing a women's college. In 1916, it became the first women's college in the South to earn a [[Phi Beta Kappa]] charter.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.randolphcollege.edu/about/history-and-legacy/ | title=Randolph College History and Legacy }}</ref> Beginning in 1953, the two colleges were governed by separate boards of trustees.

[[Main Hall, Randolph-Macon Women's College|Main Hall]], built in 1891, was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1979.<ref name="nris">{{NRISref|version=2009a}}</ref>

In August 2006, only a few weeks into the academic year, Randolph-Macon Woman's College announced that it would adopt coeducation and change its name. Former Interim president Ginger H. Worden argued in a September 17, 2006 editorial for ''[[The Washington Post]]'' that,

<blockquote>today, the college is embarking on a new future, one that will include men. Yet that original mission, that dedication to women's values and education, remains. The fact of the marketplace is that only 3 percent of college-age women say they will consider a women's college. The majority of our own students say they weren't looking for a single-sex college specifically. Most come despite the fact that we are a single-sex college. Our enrollment problems are not going away, and we compete with both coed and single-sex schools. Of the top 10 colleges to which our applicants also apply, seven are coed. Virtually all who transfer from R-MWC do so to a coed school. These market factors affect our financial realities.<ref>{{cite news | first=Virginia| last=Worden| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/09/15/AR2006091500939_pf.html| title=Why We Had No Choice but to Go Coed| publisher=washingtonpost.edu | date=2006-09-17| accessdate=2006-10-20}}</ref></blockquote>

The decision to go co-ed was not welcomed by everyone. Alumnae and students organized protests which were covered by local and national media.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/21/education/21women.html "Women's colleges"], ''New York Times'', 21 September 2006</ref> Many students accused the school of having recruited them under false pretenses, as the administration did not warn new or current students that they were considering admitting men.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=OQoqAAAAIBAJ&sjid=jNAEAAAAIBAJ&pg=7124%2C2327029|title=Herald-Journal - Google News Archive Search|publisher=News.google.com|accessdate=20 December 2014}}</ref> Lawsuits were filed against the school by both students and alumnae.

It was renamed ''Randolph College'' on July 1, 2007, when it became [[coeducational]]. The ensuing period of integration was, perhaps unsurprisingly, difficult. The first full-time male students saw their mailboxes and doors vandalized, and were quickly polarized{{Citation needed|date=June 2020}}. The last class to have the option to receive diplomas from Randolph-Macon Woman's College graduated on May 16, 2010. Over ten years has greatly eased the tension, and the percentage of male students has increased{{vague|date=June 2020}}. While there is virtually no animosity towards current male students from their female counterparts, some have noted a less-than-favorable treatment from recent alumnae{{Citation needed|date=June 2020}}.

Randolph College is named after [[John Randolph of Roanoke|John Randolph]] of Roanoke, Virginia. Randolph (1773-1833) was an eccentric planter and politician who, in his will, released hundreds of slaves after his death and once fought a duel with Henry Clay.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/who-was-john-randolph/|title=Who Was John Randolph?|accessdate=13 March 2018}}</ref>

==Maier Museum of Art at Randolph College==
{{main|Maier Museum of Art}}
Randolph College's Maier Museum of Art<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.maiermuseum.org/|title=Maier Museum of Art at Randolph College|work=Maier Museum of Art at Randolph College|accessdate=20 December 2014}}</ref> features works by outstanding American artists of the 19th and 20th centuries. The College has been collecting American art since 1920 and the Maier now houses a collection of several thousand paintings, prints, drawings, and photographs in the College's permanent collection.

The Maier hosts an active schedule of special exhibitions and education programs throughout the year. Through its programs, internships, museum studies practicums, and class visits, the Maier Museum of Art provides valuable learning opportunities for Randolph students and the community at large.

In 2007, there was some controversy when Randolph College announced that it would sell four paintings from its collection.<ref>{{cite web|title=Randolph College to Auction Four Paintings|url=http://web.randolphcollege.edu/newsevents/pressreleases/news_detail.asp?id=648|publisher=Randolph College|accessdate=2 October 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511093432/http://web.randolphcollege.edu/newsevents/pressreleases/news_detail.asp?id=648|archive-date=2008-05-11|url-status=dead}}</ref>

==Traditions==

===Odd and Even Class Rivalry===
The rivalry between 'odd' and 'even' graduating classes is the lynchpin of many traditions at Randolph College. The groups are distinguished based on whether their graduation year is an odd or even number, hence the names. As students spend four years earning their undergraduate degrees at Randolph, there are always two odd 'sister-classes' and two even 'sister-classes'. These groups participate in certain celebratory events together depending on the year.

==Special programs==

===Randolph College Abroad: The World in Britain===
Since 1968, the college has hosted a study abroad program at the [[University of Reading]], [[England]]. Each year as many as 35 students are selected for the program. Commonly taken during the junior year, students may choose to enroll for the full academic year or for the fall or spring semester only. Students live in one of three Randolph-owned houses across the street from the University of Reading campus, and travel as a class to various cities and destinations in England.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.randolphcollege.edu/britain/|title=Randolph College|work=Randolph College Abroad: The World in Britain|accessdate=20 December 2014}}</ref>

In 2018, the Randolph College Board of Trustees made the decision to end The World in Britain program after the ensuing academic year. This decision is believed to relate to a recent uptick in tuition costs from the University of Reading, itself, making the program financially unviable. Many students and alums of the program were saddened by this news, as they considered it to be a critical component of their educational experience.

===The American Culture program===
A minor in American Culture offers Randolph College students the opportunity to study American society and culture by drawing upon resources, techniques, and approaches from a variety of disciplines. The American Culture program also accepts visiting students from other American colleges and universities for a one-semester intensive study of a particular theme or region, including literature, art, history, and travel components.

*[[Louise Jordan Smith]], (1869-1928), painter
