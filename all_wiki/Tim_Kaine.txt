{{Tim Kaine series}}
'''Timothy Michael Kaine''' ({{IPAc-en|k|eɪ|n}}, born February 26, 1958) is an American lawyer and politician serving as the [[Seniority in the United States Senate|junior]] [[United States Senate|United States senator]] from [[Virginia]] since 2013. A member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], he previously served as the [[Lieutenant Governor of Virginia|38th lieutenant governor of Virginia]] from 2002 to 2006 and [[List of governors of Virginia|70th]] [[governor of Virginia]] from 2006 to 2010. Kaine was the Democratic nominee for [[Vice President of the United States]] in the [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 election]] as the running mate of [[Hillary Clinton]].

Born in [[Saint Paul, Minnesota]], Kaine grew up in [[Overland Park, Kansas]], graduated from the [[University of Missouri]] in [[Columbia, Missouri]] and earned a [[Juris Doctor]] degree from [[Harvard Law School]] before entering private practice and becoming a lecturer at the [[University of Richmond School of Law]]. He was first elected to public office in 1994, when he won a seat on the [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]] [[City council|City Council]]. He was then elected [[Mayor of Richmond, Virginia|Mayor of Richmond]] in 1998 and was in that position until being elected [[Lieutenant Governor of Virginia]] in 2001. Kaine was elected [[Governor of Virginia]] [[2005 Virginia gubernatorial election|in 2005]] and was in that office from 2006 to 2010. He was chairman of the [[Democratic National Committee]] from 2009 to 2011.

On July 22, 2016, Hillary Clinton introduced Kaine as her vice presidential [[running mate]]. The [[2016 Democratic National Convention]] nominated him on July 27. Despite winning a [[Plurality (voting)|plurality]] of the national popular vote, the Clinton{{ndash}}Kaine ticket lost the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]], and thus the election, to the Republican [[Ticket (election)|ticket]] of [[Donald Trump]] and [[Mike Pence]] on November 8, 2016. Kaine successfully sought re-election to a second Senate term in [[2018 United States Senate election in Virginia|2018]], defeating Republican [[Corey Stewart]].

===Budget and economy===
Among Kaine's greatest challenges as governor came during the [[Financial crisis of 2007–08|2008–09 economic crisis]]; the ''Washington Post'' wrote that "perhaps his greatest success was keeping the state running despite [the crisis]."<ref name="alook"/> In the midst of the [[Great Recession]], unemployment in Virginia remained lower than the national average.<ref name="SchoenCNBC">John W.

As governor, Kaine approved about $3.31 billion in [[general fund]] spending cuts, and after the end of Kaine's term in office, the Virginia General Assembly adopted about $1.33 billion in additional budget cuts that Kaine had recommended, for a total of $4.64 billion in cuts.<ref>Warren Fiske, [http://www.politifact.com/virginia/statements/2012/oct/24/tim-kaine/tim-kaine-says-he-cut-5-billion-spending-governor/ Tim Kaine says he cut $5 billion in spending as governor], ''PolitiFact'' (October 24, 2012).</ref> The ''Washington Post'' noted: "Unable to raise taxes and required by law to balance the budget, he was forced to make unpopular cuts that led to such things as shuttered highway rest stops and higher public university tuition."<ref name="alook"/> Virginia was one of three states to earn the highest grade in terms of management in a report by the non-partisan Pew Center on the States.<ref name="GeigerBest">{{cite web|author=Jacob Geiger|url=http://www.politifact.com/virginia/statements/2011/apr/07/tim-kaine/tim-kaine-says-virginia-named-best-managed-state-b/|title=Tim Kaine says Virginia named best managed state, best for business while he was governor|work=PolitiFact|date=April 7, 2011}}</ref> Virginia took first place each year from 2006 to 2009 in the "Best States For Business" rankings published by ''Forbes'' magazine.<ref name="GeigerBest" />

===Infrastructure and transportation===
[[File:Kaine Warner.png|thumb|right|Governor Kaine with U.S. senators<br>[[John Warner]] and [[George Allen (U.S. politician)|George Allen]]]]
In July 2007, during the debate on the [[Silver Line (Washington Metro)|Silver Line]] of the [[Washington Metro]] through [[Tysons Corner, Virginia|Tysons Corner]], Kaine supported an elevated track solution in preference to a tunnel, citing costs and potential delays that would put federal funding at risk.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/09/06/AR2006090601340.html |title=No Tunnel For Tysons, Kaine Says |date=September 7, 2006|access-date=May 4, 2016|first=Alec |last=MacGillis |work=The Washington Post}}</ref>

In 2006, early in his term, Kaine pressed the general assembly to support a legislative package to ease severe [[traffic congestion]] by spending about $1 billion annually for [[highway construction]], repairs to aging roads, [[mass transit]], and other transportation projects. The money would raised through increases in taxes and fees that would have raised an estimated $4 billion in revenue over four years.<ref>{{cite web|author=Sean Gorman|url=http://www.politifact.com/virginia/statements/2016/jul/28/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-tim-kaine-proposed-4-billion-tax/|title=Donald Trump says Tim Kaine proposed $4 billion tax increase during first week as governor|work=PolitiFact|date=July 28, 2016|quote=Six days after taking office in January 2006, Kaine proposed an unsuccessful measure to raise $1 billion a year to deal with long-standing transportation woes.

The ''Washington Post'' estimated the higher taxes and fees would raise revenue of $1 billion a year, or $4 billion total over the four years of Kaine's term.

Leaders Push Increase In Taxes, Fees To Aid Roads], ''Washington Post'' (January 21, 2006): "Kaine ... and a bipartisan group of state senators offered competing proposals Friday to raise taxes and fees, with each plan generating close to $4 billion by 2010, to relieve the state's congested transportation network. ... Kaine is seeking higher taxes on auto insurance and the purchase of a car as well as stiffer fees for car registration and driving offenses. With nearly $1 billion more to spend each year, the new governor said, he can double the state's support for mass transit, increase highway construction by 90 percent and revive stalled road projects. The money would help build a connected network of carpool or express toll lanes on all of Northern Virginia's major highways, buy rail cars for Virginia Railway Express and Metro, widen Interstates 95 and 66, and fix traffic bottlenecks."</ref> The Democratic-controlled Senate supported the plan, but the Republican-controlled House was ultimately unwilling to approve the taxes necessary to carry out the project, however, and the effort failed even after a [[special session]] of the legislature was called over the transportation-funding stalemate.<ref name="ShearTrafficBudget">Michael D.

In 2007, Republicans in the General Assembly passed their own transportation-funding bill. Rather than a statewide tax increase to finance the transportation improvements, as Kaine and most legislative Democrats favored, the Republican bill called for transportation funding "to come from borrowing $2.5 billion and paying the debt costs out of the general fund"; authorized local tax increase in Northern Virginia; increased fees and taxes on rental cars, commercial real estate, and hotels; and increased [[traffic infraction]] fines and driver's licenses fees.<ref>{{cite news|first1=Michael D. |last1=Shear |first2= Tim |last2=Craig |url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/02/23/AR2007022301367.html |title= Va.

Kaine previously criticized the Obama administration for "not providing a 'broad enough religious employer exemption'" in the [[contraceptive mandate]] of the [[Affordable Care Act]], but praised a 2012 amendment to the regulations that required insurers to provide [[birth control]] to employees when an employer was an objecting religious organization.<ref>{{cite news|first=Daniel |last= Strauss |url=http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/209997--tim-kaine-pleased-with-contraception-rule-change |title= Tim Kaine praises Obama on changing contraception rule |work =The Hill |date=February 10, 2012}}</ref>

On July 31, 2019, following Attorney General [[William Barr]] announcing that the United States federal government would resume the use of the death penalty for the first time in over twenty years, Kaine was a cosponsor of a bill banning the death penalty.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/455597-senate-dems-introduce-bill-to-ban-death-penalty|title=Booker, Durbin and Leahy introduce bill to ban death penalty|first=Tal|last=Axelrod|date=July 31, 2019|newspaper=The Hill}}</ref>

=== Environment, energy, and climate change ===
Kaine acknowledges the [[scientific consensus on climate change]], and in a 2014 Senate speech criticized [[climate change denial|climate change deniers]], as well as those who "may not deny the climate science, but ... deny that the U.S. can or should be a leader in taking any steps" to address the issue.<ref name="KaineClimateChange">[https://www.kaine.senate.gov/press-releases/kaine-solution-to-climate-change-is-american-innovation Kaine: Solution To Climate Change Is American Innovation], Office of Senator Tim Kaine (March 11, 2014).</ref>

Kaine has expressed concern about [[sea level rise]] (a major consequence of climate change),<ref name="HerbPartyLine" /> and in particular its effect on coastal Virginia.<ref name="KaineClimateChange" /> In 2014, he partnered with two Virginia Republicans—U.S. Representatives [[Rob Wittman]] and [[Scott Rigell]]—to hold a conference on sea-level rise and "local adaptation efforts to protect military installations in the [[Hampton Roads]] area."<ref name="HerbPartyLine" />

Kaine endorses making [[Coal pollution mitigation|coal energy production cleaner]], saying that it is imperative "to convert coal to electricity with less pollution than we do today."<ref name="KaineClimateChange" /> He has criticized those who "frame the debate as a conflict between an economy and the environment," saying that "protecting the environment is good for the economy."<ref name="KaineClimateChange" /> Kaine co-sponsored the Advanced Clean Coal Technology Investment in Our Nation (ACCTION) Act, legislation to increase investment in clean coal technologies.<ref name="KaineEnergy">{{cite web|url=https://www.kaine.senate.gov/issues/energy|title=Tim Kaine Senate Website – Energy|author=Staff|access-date=July 21, 2016}}</ref> He voted against passage of legislation to approve the [[Keystone Pipeline|Keystone XL]] pipeline.<ref name="KaineKeystone">{{cite web|url=https://www.kaine.senate.gov/issues/energy|title=Kaine Statement On Passage Of Keystone XL Pipeline Legislation|author=Staff|access-date=July 21, 2016}}</ref> Kaine supports the use of [[hydraulic fracturing]] (fracking) to harvest natural gas from shale formations. He believes this will reduce carbon pollution.<ref name="KaineEnergy" /> Kaine voted against an amendment, introduced by Democratic Senator [[Kirsten Gillibrand]] of New York, that would have repealed a provision in the [[Energy Policy Act of 2005]] that exempts hydraulic fracturing from the underground injection control provisions of the [[Safe Drinking Water Act]]. As a result, regulation of hydraulic fracturing remains in the hands of state agencies; the U.S. EPA cannot regulate hydraulic fracturing nor require a federal permit.<ref name="EnergyWire2015">{{cite news|url=http://www.eenews.net/stories/1060012514|title=Senate votes to keep 'Halliburton loophole'; regulation stays with states|date=January 29, 2015|newspaper=[[EnergyWire]]|first1=Mike|last1=Soraghan}}</ref><ref name="NatEnvScore">{{cite web|url=http://scorecard.lcv.org/moc/timothy-kaine|title=National Environmental Scorecard – Tim Kaine|publisher=League of Conservation Voters|author=Staff|access-date=July 23, 2016}}</ref> Kaine supports exporting [[liquefied natural gas]] (LNG) to other countries.<ref name="KaineExportLNG">{{cite web|url=https://www.kaine.senate.gov/press-releases/kaine-introduces-bipartisan-bill-to-streamline-american-lng-exports|title=Kaine Introduces Bipartisan Bill To Streamline American LNG Exports|date=January 7, 2015|author=Staff|access-date=July 23, 2016}}</ref>

Like his fellow senator from Virginia, [[Mark Warner]], Kaine applauded the [[U.S. Forest Service]]'s plan to close most, but not all, of the [[George Washington National Forest]] to [[hydraulic fracturing]] and other [[horizontal drilling]] activities.<ref name="RoanokePark2014">{{cite news|url=http://www.roanoke.com/news/politics/kaine-warner-praise-george-washington-forest-fracking-decision/article_eacfe63e-04c2-589a-8c6a-68f6a7661185.html|title=Kaine, Warner praise George Washington forest fracking decision|date=November 18, 2014|newspaper=[[Waynesboro News Virginian]]|first1=Bob|last1=Stuart}}</ref>

In 2013, Kaine supported [[Offshore drilling on the Atlantic coast of the United States|oil and gas exploration off the coast of Virginia]], saying, "I have long believed that the moratorium on offshore drilling, based on a cost-benefit calculation performed decades ago, should be re-examined."<ref name="KaineAtlantic">{{cite web|url=https://www.kaine.senate.gov/issues/energy|title=Tim Kaine Senate Website – Kaine Statement On Atlantic Oil Drilling Announcement|author=Staff|access-date=July 21, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.dailypress.com/2013-05-22/news/dp-nws-warner-kaine-offshore-drilling-20130522_1_tim-kaine-oil-drilling-mark-warner|title=U.S. Sens.

I have participated in this debate for over a decade as a governor and member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. The DOD has been relatively quiet during this public debate and has never shared their objections with me before."<ref name=":0" /> By August 2016, Kaine stated his support for a ban on offshore drilling, bringing his position in line with that of Hillary Clinton and the Obama administration.<ref name=":0" />

Kaine supports the development of solar energy and offshore wind turbines.<ref name="KaineEnergy" /> Based on his votes on environmental issues in the Senate, the [[League of Conservation Voters]] has given Kaine a 95% score for 2018, and a 94% lifetime score.<ref name="NatEnvScore" /> (At the time of his 2016 vice presidential campaign, Kaine had an 88% score for 2015, and a 91% lifetime score.)<ref name="HerbPartyLine" />

In March 2019, Kaine was one of eleven senators to sponsor the Climate Security Act of 2019, legislation forming a new group within the State Department that would have the responsibility for developing strategies to integrate climate science and data into operations of national security as well as restoring the post of special envoy for the Arctic, which had been dismantled by President Trump in 2017. The proposed envoy would advise the president and the administration on the potential effects of climate on national security and be responsible for facilitating all interagency communication between federal science and security agencies.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/433704-new-bill-aims-to-counter-controversial-white-house-climate-security|title=Democrats offer legislation to counter White House climate science council|first=Miranda|last=Green|date=March 12, 2019|newspaper=The Hill}}</ref>

In April 2019, Kaine was one of twelve senators to sign a bipartisan letter to top senators on the Appropriations Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development advocating for the Energy Department to be granted with maximum funding for carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS), citing American job growth could be stimulated through investment in creating viable options to capture carbon emissions released into the atmosphere and expressing disagreement with the 2020 budget request of President Trump that called for combining the two federal programs that include carbon capture research.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/437618-bipartisan-group-of-senators-request-highest-possible-funding-for|title=Bipartisan senators want 'highest possible' funding for carbon capture technology|first=Miranda|last=Green|date=April 5, 2019|newspaper=The Hill}}</ref>

=== Financial regulation ===
Kaine strongly supports [[financial regulation]] and the [[Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act]].<ref name="GearanLiberals" /> In July 2016, Kaine signed a bipartisan letter that "urged the [[Consumer Financial Protection Bureau]] to 'carefully tailor its rulemaking' [under Dodd-Frank] regarding [[community bank]]s and [[credit union]]s so as not to 'unduly burden' these institutions with regulations aimed at [[commercial bank]]s."<ref name="GearanLiberals" /> The letter prompted criticism from [[Modern liberalism in the United States|progressives]] who viewed it as anti-regulation.<ref name="GearanLiberals" /><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/trailguide/la-na-trailguide-updates-clinton-vp-rnc-liberals-rip-into-tim-kaine-for-1469194188-htmlstory.html|title=Liberals rip into Sen.

Chamberlain|Charles Chamberlain]], executive director of [[Democracy for America]], called the letter "a lobbyist-driven effort to help banks dodge consumer protection standards and regulations designed to prevent banks from destroying our economy." Kaine responded to the criticism by saying, "it's important you don't treat every [[financial institution]] the same. It wasn't credit unions that tanked the economy, it wasn't local community banks that tanked the economy, generally wasn't regional banks that did things that tanked the economy."<ref name="GearanLiberals" /> Kaine also signed a letter urging that a requirement that regional banks report liquidity levels on a daily basis be loosened.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/liberals-criticize-kaine-for-supporting-regulations-pushed-by-banks/2016/07/21/77c165e2-4f5b-11e6-aa14-e0c1087f7583_story.html|title=Liberals criticize Kaine for supporting regulations pushed by banks|last=Gearan|first=Anne|date=July 21, 2016|work=The Washington Post}}</ref>

=== Foreign and defense policy ===
In the Senate, Kaine has supported the [[Cuban Thaw|normalization of U.S.–Cuban relations]] and the [[Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action|international nuclear agreement with Iran]].<ref name="KaineClintonComparison">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/23/us/politics/tim-kaine-issues.html|title=How Tim Kaine and Hillary Clinton Compare on the Issues|date=July 22, 2016|work=The New York Times|last2=Rappeport|first2=Alan|first1=Katie|last1=Shepherd}}</ref>

In 2015, Kaine expressed support for the [[Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen|Saudi-led coalition's airstrikes in Yemen]] against [[Houthi]] forces fighting the government of President [[Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi]],<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2015/03/27/saudi-arabia-gets-bipartisan-backing-for-yemen-airstrikes|title=Saudi Arabia Gets Bipartisan Backing for Yemen Airstrikes|date=March 27, 2015|work=U.S. News.}}</ref> but in 2018, Kaine was one of seven senators to sign a letter to [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[Mike Pompeo]] expressing that they found it "difficult to reconcile known facts with at least two" of the Trump administration's certifications that Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates were attempting to protect Yemeni civilians and were in compliance with U.S. laws on arms sales, citing an inconsistency with a memo from Pompeo to Congress expressly stating that on some occasions the Saudi and Emirates governments had failed to adopt measures to reduce civilian casualties.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://thehill.com/policy/defense/410764-senators-demand-answers-on-trump-administration-support-for-saudi-coalition-in|title=Senators demand answers on Trump administration backing of Saudi coalition in Yemen|date=October 10, 2018|author=Kheel, Rebbeca|newspaper=The Hill}}</ref> Kaine also condemned the Trump administration over an "eagerness to give the Saudis anything they want" after the administration approved the transfer of nuclear technology to Saudi Arabia after the [[Assassination of Jamal Khashoggi|murder of Saudi dissident Jamal Khashoggi]].<ref>Andrew Desiderio, [https://www.politico.com/story/2019/06/04/trump-nuclear-expertise-transfer-saudi-arabia-khashoggi-1353179 Sen.

In 2019, Kaine was one of 34 Senate Democrats to sign a letter to President Trump urging him to reconsider cuts to U.S. foreign aid to the [[Northern Triangle]] countries of [[Central America]] in the Fiscal Year 2018 national security appropriations bill. The letter said that Trump had "consistently expressed a flawed understanding of U.S. foreign assistance," viewing it as a gift or charity to foreign governments rather than a tool to promote American interests and [[collective security]]. The senators wrote that U.S. foreign assistance to Central American countries, by improving stability and alleviating poverty in the region, reduced Central American migration flows to the U.S.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://thehill.com/policy/international/americas/437463-more-than-30-dem-sens-ask-trump-to-reconsider-cutting-foreign|title=More than 30 Senate Dems ask Trump to reconsider Central American aid cuts|first=Rachel|last=Frazin|date=April 4, 2019|newspaper=The Hill}}</ref>

In 2019, Kaine was a cosponsor of the South China Sea and East China Sea Sanctions Act, a bipartisan bill reintroduced by [[Marco Rubio]] and [[Ben Cardin]] that was intended to disrupt China's consolidation or expansion of its claims of jurisdiction over both the [[Territorial disputes in the South China Sea|sea and airspace in disputed zones in the South China Sea]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/world/united-states/bill-introduced-to-deter-china-in-south-china-east-china-seas|title=US Bill reintroduced to deter China in South China, East China seas|first=Nirmal|last=Ghosh|date=May 24, 2019|newspaper=The Straits Times}}</ref>

==== Grand strategy and democracy promotion ====
After the 2016 presidential campaign, Kaine wrote an extensive essay in ''[[Foreign Affairs]]'' outlining his underlying foreign policy philosophy.<ref name=":3">{{Cite journal|last=Kaine|first=Time|date=August 2017|title=A New Truman Doctrine: Grand Strategy in a Hyperconnected World|url=https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/2017-06-13/new-truman-doctrine|journal=Foreign Affairs|volume=96| issue =  4|pages=36–53}}</ref> According to Kaine, American foreign policy has suffered a lack of direction since the 1990s because the end of the [[Cold War]] rendered irrelevant America's previous [[grand strategy]], which Kaine identifies as the [[Truman Doctrine]]. This lack of grand strategy makes American actions seem random, complicating the policy making process and hindering efforts by American leaders to convince the general public that American foreign policy is worthwhile. To remedy this, Kaine proposes a new grand strategy based mainly on [[democracy promotion]]. Kaine's grand strategy is informed by a [[Polarity (international relations)|tri-polar balance of international power]], with one pole being democratic states including the United States and its allies, the second being autocratic powers led by [[Russia]] and [[China]], and the third being [[Non-state actor|nonstate actors]] (multinational corporations, [[Non-governmental organization|NGOs]], gangs, etc.).

First, Kaine believes that the United States should work to support democracy in already democratic countries, as democracy globally has been declining for many years.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://freedomhouse.org/article/freedom-world-2017-freedom-decline-continues-amid-rising-populism-and-autocracy|title=Freedom in the World 2017: Freedom decline continues amid rising populism and autocracy|website=freedomhouse.org|language=en|access-date=January 3, 2018}}</ref> To maintain democracy in democratic countries, Kaine proposes the creation of an [[intergovernmental organization]] consisting of all the world's democracies in which states can cooperate on solutions to problems such as corruption and voter inclusion. He compares this hypothetical group to the [[OECD|Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development]], in which advanced industrialized countries collaborate on economic policy. Kaine believes that this new organization will help democracies remain democratic, as well as promoting democracy in other countries by providing those countries viable democratic examples for them to emulate. In this way, Kaine says that the United States should no longer see itself as the indispensable nation, but rather the "exemplary democracy."

Second, Kaine proposes that democracies should coordinate to best interact with authoritarian states. Depending on the circumstances, democracies should either "confront," "compete," or "cooperate" with autocracies. For example, Kaine observes that the United States competes with its authoritarian adversaries by strengthening military and commercial alliances, and it confronts them by decrying their [[human rights]] records.<ref name=":3" />

Finally, Kaine believes that democracies and autocracies should cooperate when they have the same interests, such as combating [[climate change]].

In July 2017, Kaine expanded on the grand strategy proposed in this essay in an interview at the [[Brookings Institution]] with international relations scholar [[Robert Kagan]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2017/07/31/the-geopolitics-of-democracy-promotion/|title=The geopolitics of democracy promotion|last=Moreland|first=Will|date=July 31, 2017|work=Brookings|access-date=January 3, 2018|language=en-US}}</ref>

====Afghanistan====
On the issue of the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|war in Afghanistan]], Kaine's website states "The main mission in Afghanistan—destroying [[Al Qaeda]]—is nearly complete and we should bring our troops home as quickly as we can, consistent with the need to make sure that Afghanistan poses no danger in the broader region."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kaineforva.com/national_security|title=Tim Kaine for U.S. Senate|publisher=Kaineforva.com|access-date=August 9, 2014}}</ref>

==== Latin America ====
Kaine believes that American foreign policy has neglected relations with [[Latin America]] and argues for an increased focus on [[the Americas]], saying, "We have seldom paid enough attention to the Americas, in particular, and when we have—whether through the Monroe Doctrine or by battling communist movements during the Cold War—we have focused more on blocking outsiders from building influence in the Western Hemisphere than we have on the nations already there."<ref name=":3" />

==== War powers ====
Kaine is known for "expertise on the constitutional powers of the presidency"<ref name="PortnoyPenceReturns"/> and has said that "war powers questions" are a "personal obsession" of his.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.kaine.senate.gov/tim-in-the-news/a-better-approach-to-war-powers|title=A Better Approach to War Powers|date=September 23, 2014|publisher=[[National Defense University]]|author=Tim Kaine|magazine=PRISM Magazine}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/all-opinions-are-local/wp/2016/07/22/from-the-archive-tim-kaine-probably-is-at-the-top-of-everyones-vp-list/|title=From the archive: Tim Kaine probably is at the top of everyone's VP list|date=July 22, 2016|last2=Goldman|first2=Paul|postscript=;|first1=Norman|last1=Leahy|website=The Washington Post}} republishing post of October 14, 2014.</ref> He has stressed that under the Constitution, "Congress has the power to declare war — and only Congress."<ref name="Matishak">Martin Matishak, [https://www.politico.com/story/2018/04/15/kaine-trump-syria-war-powers-524744 Kaine: Trump not a 'king,' can't go to war without Congress], ''Politico'' (April 15, 2018).</ref> Kaine has termed [[2018 bombing of Damascus and Homs|U.S. missile strikes against the Syrian government]] in 2018, ordered by Trump, as illegal because they were undertaken without congressional approval.<ref name="Matishak"/>

Kaine and Republican senator [[John McCain]] of Arizona introduced the War Powers Consultation Act of 2014,<ref name="5QuestionsWarPowers">{{cite web|url=http://warontherocks.com/2014/02/5-questions-with-senator-tim-kaine-on-war-powers-and-national-defense/|title=5 Questions with Senator Tim Kaine on War Powers and National Defense|date=February 10, 2014|website=War on the Rocks|author=Ryan Evans}}</ref> which would replace the [[War Powers Act of 1973]], bringing the Congress back into decisions on the deployment of U.S. military forces.<ref name="5QuestionsWarPowers" /> The bill would establish a Congressional Consultation Committee, with which the president would be required to consult regularly regarding significant foreign policy matters; before ordering the deployment of the armed forces into a significant armed conflict; and at least every two months for the duration of any significant armed conflict.<ref name="5QuestionsWarPowers" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cfr.org/wars-and-warfare/war-powers-consultation-act-2014/p36302|title=War Powers Consultation Act of 2014|publisher=Council on Foreign Relations|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160829030521/http://www.cfr.org/wars-and-warfare/war-powers-consultation-act-2014/p36302|archive-date=August 29, 2016}}</ref> Kaine argued for the bill by citing his "frustration" over the sloppiness of "process and communication over decisions of war", noting that "presidents tend to overreach and Congress sometimes willingly ducks tough votes and decisions. We all have to do better."<ref name="5QuestionsWarPowers" />

In February 2018, Kaine was one of eighteen senators to sign a letter to President Trump arguing that striking [[North Korea]] with "a preventative or preemptive U.S. military strike would lack either a constitutional basis or legal authority" without congressional approval.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/372311-dem-senators-tell-trump-he-doesnt-have-legal-authority-to-launch-preemptive|title=Dem senators tell Trump he doesn't have 'legal authority' to launch preemptive strike on North Korea|date=February 5, 2018|newspaper=The Hill}}</ref>

In 2014, Kaine argued that the U.S. military intervention against [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] (ISIL), undertaken by President Obama, was unconstitutional without a new congressional authorization for the [[Military intervention against ISIL|use of military force against ISIL]].<ref>{{cite news|author=Meg Anderson|url=https://www.npr.org/2016/07/23/487082207/where-tim-kaine-and-hillary-clinton-stand-on-key-issues|title=Where Tim Kaine and Hillary Clinton Stand On Key Issues|date=July 23, 2016|publisher=NPR}}</ref> In November 2014, at the [[Halifax International Security Forum]], Kaine, along with Senator [[John McCain]], emphasized the necessity of such a congressional authorization, saying: "You just can't have a war without Congress.

In 2018, Kaine, along with fellow Democratic senator [[Michael Bennet]], proposed the creation of "Medicare X"&mdash;a [[public health insurance option]] modeled after [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] that would be available on ACA [[health insurance marketplace]]s along with private options.

In December 2018, Kaine was one of forty-two senators to sign a letter to Trump administration officials [[Alex Azar]], [[Seema Verma]], and [[Steve Mnuchin]] arguing that the administration was improperly using Section 1332 of the Affordable Care Act to authorize states to "increase health care costs for millions of consumers while weakening protections for individuals with pre-existing conditions."
