'''Zuzana Čaputová''', {{post-nominals|list=[[Tree of Peace Memorial Plaque|MPTP]]}} ({{IPA-sk|ˈzuzana ˈtʃaputɔʋaː}}; {{née}} '''Strapáková'''; born 21 June 1973) is a Slovak politician, lawyer, and environmental activist who has been [[President of Slovakia]] since 15 June 2019.

She first became known by prevailing in a decade-long struggle against the situating of a toxic landfill in her hometown of [[Pezinok]]. For this, Čaputová was awarded the 2016 [[Goldman Environmental Prize]].

Čaputová won the [[2019 Slovak presidential election|2019 presidential election]] with 58% of the vote in the run-off. "We’ll try to have a constructive relationship with neighbouring countries but at the same time have clear stances and positions based on values," she told an interviewer.<ref>{{cite news|title=Zuzana Čaputová, the spiritual liberal who beat Slovakia's populists|date=13 April 2019|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/13/zuzana-caputova-slovakia-president-spiritual-liberal-progressive-values|work=Guardian|access-date=13 April 2019|quote=The country’s first female president says she won’t compromise on progressive values in her search for pragmatic solutions}}</ref>

[[File:Robert Mistrík odstupuje z prezidentskej kampane-IMG 0804-SF.jpg|thumb|Čaputová and [[Robert Mistrík]], initially a front-runner who withdrew from the race and endorsed her.]]
In a press conference held on 29 March 2018, Čaputová announced her bid for the Slovak presidency in the [[2019 Slovak presidential election|2019 presidential race]], having been endorsed by Progressive Slovakia along with [[Freedom and Solidarity|SaS]] and SPOLU, after her main opponent, [[Robert Mistrík]], withdrew from the race and endorsed her on 26 February 2019.<ref>{{Cite web| title = Robert Mistrík pulls out of Slovak presidential race, backs Zuzana Čaputová| url = https://emerging-europe.com/news/robert-mistrik-pulls-out-of-slovak-presidential-race-backs-zuzana-caputova/ | publisher = Emerging Europe| author=Patricolo, Claudia| date=February 27, 2019|accessdate = March 31, 2019}}</ref> She said she had felt compelled to run for the Presidency after the [[Murder of Ján Kuciak|murder of the investigative journalist Ján Kuciak]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://spectator.sme.sk/c/22088177/presidential-election-slovakia-caputova-victory-world-media-response.html|title=Čaputová framed the election "as a struggle between good and evil"|first=Petit Press|last=a.s|date=31 March 2019|website=spectator.sme.sk}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/31/slovakia-elects-zuzana-caputova-first-female-president|title=Slovakia's first female president hails victory for progressive values|date=31 March 2019|via=www.theguardian.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://emerging-europe.com/news/humanist-lawyer-becomes-slovakias-first-female-president/|title=Humanist lawyer becomes Slovakia's first female president|date=31 March 2019|website=Emerging Europe}}</ref>

== Political positions ==
=== Equality ===
On her campaign website, Čaputová says that "justice in Slovakia does not always apply equally to everyone". In keeping with her statements during the campaign, she plans to introduce changes to Slovakia's police and judicial system. She campaigned for the police force to be an independent institution without political influence, headed by an impartial professional with proven service. She further claims that it is necessary to transform the prosecutor's office into a publicly managed institution.<ref name="auto">{{cite web|url=https://www.zuzanacaputova.sk/program/|title=Volebný program|website=zuzanacaputova.sk|accessdate=25 March 2019}}</ref>

=== Environment ===
Čaputová is an environmental campaigner who has been compared to American activist [[Erin Brockovich]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.climatechangenews.com/2019/04/01/slovakian-president-elect-green-campaigner-will-fight-coal-subsidies/|title=Slovakian president-elect is a green campaigner who will fight coal subsidies|date=2019-04-01|website=Climate Home News|language=en|access-date=2019-11-04}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://theecologist.org/2019/apr/04/slovakian-president-elect-fight-coal-subsidies|title=Slovakian president-elect to fight coal subsidies|website=The Ecologist|language=en|access-date=2019-11-04}}</ref> [[Climate change mitigation]] is one of her highest priorities, and for that reason she is ending subsidies for coal and other fossil fuels. Čaputová has promised to phase out [[coal]] mining and power generation by 2023, and brought her nation into the [[Powering Past Coal Alliance]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://poweringpastcoal.org/news/PPCA-news/new-alliance-members-un-climate-action-summit|title=Germany and Slovakia head list of new members at UN Climate Action Summit {{!}} Powering Past Coal Alliance|website=Powering Past Coal Alliance (PPCA)|language=en|access-date=2019-11-04}}</ref>

Čaputová holds that [[environmental protection]] should include stopping illegal deforestation and that 5% of the most environmentally valuable territory should remain as a strictly protected zone.<ref name="auto" />

=== LGBT rights===
{{See also|LGBT rights in Slovakia}}
Čaputová has stated that she supports registered partnerships for same-sex couples, and educating the general public on these relationships. In a discussion organized by ''[[SME (newspaper)|SME Journal]]'', she lectured on the possibility of adoption by gay couples: "I prefer the child to have a biological mother and a biological father. If he were to grow up in institutional care, I think he'd be better off with two loving beings, even if they were of the same sex".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://domov.sme.sk/c/22045481/prezidentske-volby-2019-diskusia-caputova-vs-mistrik.html|title=Čaputová sa nevzdá v prospech Mistríka len preto, ak by mal vyššie preferencie|last=a.s|first=Petit Press|website=domov.sme.sk|language=sk|access-date=2019-03-17}}</ref>

=== Abortion and reproductive rights ===
Čaputová supports maintaining the status quo regarding [[Abortion in Slovakia|abortion]] and [[reproductive rights]]: "If there is an extreme situation and the dilemma is between deciding whether to adopt a legal norm that will intrude upon the personal lives of citizens or leave it to women's responsibility and their personal choice, I choose the responsibility of a woman".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://dennikn.sk/blog/1384515/zuzana-caputova-pre-krestana-nepripustny-kandidat-analyza/|title=Zuzana Čaputová – pre kresťana neprípustný kandidát?
