'''British ''Vogue''''' is a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[fashion magazine]] published based in [[London]] since autumn 1916. It is the British edition of the American magazine ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'' and is owned and distributed by [[Condé Nast]]. British ''Vogue''’s editor in 2012 claimed that, “''Vogue''’s power is universally acknowledged. It's the place everybody wants to be if they want to be in the world of fashion" and 85% of the magazine's readers agree that “''Vogue'' is the Fashion Bible”.<ref name="editorquote">{{cite web |url=http://www.vogue.co.uk/voguemediapack/swfa/ |title=Media Information |work=Vogue |location=UK |accessdate=22 March 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120414152727/http://www.vogue.co.uk/voguemediapack/swfa/ |archive-date=14 April 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The magazine is considered to be one that links fashion to high society and class, teaching its readers how to ‘assume a distinctively [[Chic (style)|chic]] and modern appearance’.<ref name="fashion">König A.

British ''Vogue'' is a magazine whose success is based upon its advertising rather than its [[sales revenue]].  In 2007, it ran 2,020 pages of advertising at an average of £16,000 a page. It is deemed to be more commercial than other editions of ''Vogue.''<ref>{{cite web|author=english@peopledaily.com.cn |url=http://english.people.com.cn/200507/21/eng20050721_197537.html |title=China's in vogue so Vogue's in China |work=People's Daily  |date=21 July 2005 |accessdate=22 March 2012}}</ref> British ''Vogue'' is the most profitable British magazine as well as the most profitable edition of ''Vogue'' besides the [[Vogue (magazine)|US]] and [[Vogue China|China]] editions.<ref>{{cite web|title=Vogue China celebrates 100 issues with Mario Testino edition|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|author=[[Lisa Armstrong]]|url=http://fashion.telegraph.co.uk/article/TMG10425188/Vogue-China-celebrates-100-issues-with-Mario-Testino-edition.html|quote=Angelica Cheung is arguably the most powerful ''Vogue'' editor in the world.

== History ==
During the [[World War I|First World War]], [[Condé Nast Publications|Condé Nast]], ''Vogue''{{'}}s publisher, had to deal with restrictions on overseas shipping as well as paper shortages in America. The British edition of ''Vogue'' was the answer to this problem, providing ''Vogue'' fashion coverage in the [[British Isles]] when it was not practicable to receive it in the usual way. Under the London edition's second editor, [[Elspeth Champcommunal]],<ref name=elspeth>{{cite web |url=http://www.vogue.co.uk/magazine/archive/search/Editor/Elspeth%20Champcommunal |title=Elspeth Champcommunal Contribution |work=Vogue |location=UK |date=17 May 2011 |accessdate=22 March 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120405045834/http://www.vogue.co.uk/magazine/archive/search/Editor/Elspeth%20Champcommunal |archivedate=5 April 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> the magazine was essentially the same as the American edition, except for its [[British English]] spellings. However, Champcommunal thought it important that ''Vogue'' be more than a fashion magazine.  It featured articles on ‘society and sporting news... Health and beauty advice... travelogues... and editorials’, making it a 'skillfully mixed cocktail'.<ref name=society>Mahood, A., ''Fashioning Readers: The avant garde and British Vogue, 1920-9'' in ''Women'', 13 (1) (2002), pp. 37–47</ref>  Champcommunal held her editorial position until 1922.

Under its next editor, [[Dorothy Todd]], a renowned ''Vogue'' editor due to her boldness, especially in her movement to blend the arts and fashion, the magazine shifted its focus from fashion to literature, featuring articles from [[Clive Bell]] about art exhibitions in Paris.  There were also notable features from noted English writers such as [[Virginia Woolf]] and [[Aldous Huxley]].<ref>Aldous Huxley: Selected Letters". p. 144. Ivan R. Dee, 2007</ref> Due to Todd's changes, the magazine lost much of its audience, and she spent only four years as editor.<ref name=dorothy>[Reed, C. (2006). A Vogue That Dare Not Speak its Name: Sexual Subculture During the Editorship of Dorothy Todd, 1922–26. Fashion Theory: The Journal of Dress, Body & Culture, 10(1/2), 39–71.]</ref> British ''Vogue'' is not believed to have really taken off until after its third editor, [[Alison Settle]], was appointed in 1926.  

Under [[Audrey Withers]] (editor from 1940 to 1960), the magazine again took a literary direction, and during the [[World War II|Second World War]] it even took part in reporting the war. In 1944, the American photographer [[Lee Miller]] persuaded Withers to send her to [[Normandy]] to produce an article on wartime nursing; Miller then followed the Allied advance through Europe, reporting the [[liberation of Paris]] and sending a story from [[Buchenwald concentration camp|Buchenwald]].<ref>Drusilla Beyfus, 'Withers, (Elizabeth) Audrey (1905–2001), magazine editor' in ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'' (Oxford University Press, 2005)</ref>  Dame [[Anna Wintour]] edited the British edition from 1985 to 1987, before taking over ''Vogue'' in New York City. 

[[Alexandra Shulman]] was Editor-in-Chief of the magazine from 1992 to 2017. When Shulman was editor, the magazine drew more than a million readers. Shulman was known for developing collector's issues of British ''Vogue'', such as the ‘Gold Millennium Issue’ where celebrities and supermodels such as [[Kate Moss]] featured on the cover. Shulman was also praised for her use of up and coming [[Fashion photography|photographers]] like [[Mario Testino]]. {{Citation needed|date=November 2017}} Shulman became known for her attempt to change the face of fashion.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}  She pushed designers to stop using 'size-zero' models.{{cn|date=May 2020}} The magazine under Shulman  was the subject of [[Richard Macer]]'s behind-the-scenes BBC documentary, 'Absolutely Fashion: Inside British Vogue (2016).{{cn|date=May 2020}}

== British ''Vogue'' today  ==
[[Edward Enninful]] was confirmed as the new editor-in-chief of British ''Vogue'' on 10 April 2017.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-39553525|title=British Vogue hires first male editor|date=2017-04-10|work=BBC News|access-date=2017-11-17|language=en-GB}}</ref> [[Condé Nast]] International Chairman and CEO Jonathan Newhouse announced him as the successor to [[Alexandra Shulman]], calling Enninful "an influential figure in the communities of fashion, Hollywood and music which shape the cultural zeitgeist", adding that "by virtue of his talent and experience, Edward is supremely prepared to assume the responsibility of British ''Vogue''". Enninful's first issue as editor-in-chief was 2017's December issue, featuring British model and activist [[Adwoa Aboah]] on the cover.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2017/11/british-vogue-edward-enninful/545279/|title=Can a New Vogue Editor Make Britain Great Again?|last=Gilbert|first=Sophie|work=The Atlantic|access-date=2017-11-17|language=en-US}}</ref> In September 2019, Enninful collaborated with [[Meghan, Duchess of Sussex]] on the September issue.<ref>{{cite newspaper|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/29/fashion/meghan-markle-british-vogue.html|title=Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, Guest-Edits British Vogue's September Issue|last=Paton|first=Elizabeth|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=29 July 2019|accessdate=11 September 2019}}</ref> The issue highlights "Forces for Change", and features on the cover 15 activists including actress [[Salma Hayek]] and interviews with former US First Lady [[Michelle Obama]]. The magazine's September 2020 triple gatefold cover featured pictures of 20 activists often associated with the [[Black Lives Matter]] movement, including [[Marcus Rashford]] and Adwoa Aboah. The Activism Now edition was photographed by [[Misan Harriman]] and was the first British Vogue cover taken by a black man in the magazine's 104 year history (Nadine Ijewere was the first black female to take a cover photograph).<ref>Davies, Caroline, (3 August, 2020).

== Criticism ==

There has been an ongoing debate about whether or not the fashion industry is racist, and with the arrest of British designer [[John Galliano]], who was found guilty of making racist and [[anti-Semitic]] comments in a public setting,<ref name=guilty>{{cite web|author=Ella Alexander |url=http://www.vogue.co.uk/news/2011/06/20/john-galliano-arrested-in-paris-for-assault |title=John Galliano found guilty |work=Vogue |location=UK |date=20 February 2012 |accessdate=22 March 2012}}</ref> as well as the news the hairdresser [[James Brown (hair stylist)|James Brown]], who has worked closely with Kate Moss, went on a rant where he used the 'N' word,<ref name=nword>{{cite web|url=http://madnewsuk.com/2011/05/30/uk-news-celebrity-hair-stylist-james-brown-apologises-for-calling-media-personality-ben-douglas-a-nigger/ |title=James Brown apologises |publisher=Madnewsuk.com |date=30 May 2011 |accessdate=22 March 2012}}</ref> more attention has been brought to the issue.

British ''Vogue'' also faces some criticisms for fashion blunders. In 2011, the magazine was criticised for a spread in the December 2011 issue which featured a rosy-cheeked model sitting atop a [[yak]], sporting a pair of £5,820 trousers said to make the model look like the animal.<ref name=yakgirl>{{cite news|last=Fox |first=Imogen |url=https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/fashion-blog/2011/nov/01/yak-chic-vogue |title=Yak Chic Vogue |work=The Guardian |location=UK |date=1 November 2011 |accessdate=22 March 2012}}</ref>
