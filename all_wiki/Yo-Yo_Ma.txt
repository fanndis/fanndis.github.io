==Early life and education==
Yo-Yo Ma was born in Paris on October 7, 1955, to Chinese<ref name=":0" /> parents and had a musical upbringing. His mother, {{interlanguage link|Marina Lu|zh|盧雅文}}, was a singer and his father, {{interlanguage link|Hiao-Tsiun Ma|zh|馬孝駿}}, was a violinist and professor of music at Nanjing [[National Central University]] (predecessor of the present-day [[Nanjing University]] and [[Southeast University]]), and they both migrated from the [[Republic of China]] to France during the war between the Chinese government and the Communist Party. His sister, Yeou-Cheng Ma, played the violin before obtaining a medical degree and becoming a pediatrician.<ref name= "Pong">{{cite book | last=Pong | first=D. | chapter=Yo-Yo Ma | title= Encyclopedia of Modern China | publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons/Gale, Cengage Learning | year=2009 | isbn= 978-0-684-31566-9}}</ref> The family moved to [[New York City|New York]] when Ma was seven years old.<ref name= "Journeys">{{cite journal|last1= Tassel|first1=Janet|title=Yo-Yo Ma's Journeys|journal=Harvard Magazine |issue= March–April 2000 |url= http://harvardmagazine.com/2000/03/yo-yo-mas-journeys-html |accessdate=March 7, 2016}}</ref><ref name= "Smithsonian">{{cite journal|last1= Covington|first1= Richard |title= Yo-Yo Ma's Other Passion |journal=Smithsonian Magazine|issue=June 2002|url= http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/yo-yo-mas-other-passion-63898487/?no-ist |accessdate=March 7, 2016}}</ref>

From the earliest possible age, Ma played the violin, piano and later viola, but settled on cello in 1960 at age four. Ma jokes that his first choice was the double bass due to its large size, but he compromised and took up cello instead. The [[child prodigy]] began performing before audiences at age five and performed for presidents [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] and [[John F. Kennedy]] when he was seven.<ref>{{cite AV media notes | first=Mark | last=Salzman | others=Yo-Yo Ma | year=2001 | title=Classic Yo-Yo | url=http://www.artsandlectures.ucsb.edu/archive/2003-2004/perform/ma.asp | publisher=Sony | id=089667 | accessdate=January 14, 2008 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080204153205/http://www.artsandlectures.ucsb.edu/archive/2003-2004/perform/ma.asp | archivedate=February 4, 2008 | url-status=dead | df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite episode|title =1|episodelink = |series = Faces of America|serieslink = Faces of America (PBS series)|network = [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]]|airdate = February 10, 2010|season = 1|number = 1}}</ref> At age eight, he appeared on American television with his sister<ref>{{citation | last = Pang | first = Amelia | title = This Is New York: The Untold Story of Dr. Yeou-Cheng Ma, Violin Prodigy and Medical Doctor | year = 2001 | publisher = New York City Life}}</ref> in a concert conducted by [[Leonard Bernstein]].

===Silk Road Ensemble===
{{Main|Silkroad (arts organization)}}
Ma formed his own [[Silk Road Project|Silk Road Ensemble]], following the trade route which for more than 2,000&nbsp;years had been used for trade across Europe and Asia to China. His goal was that of bringing together musicians from diverse countries all of which are historically linked via the [[Silk Road]]. His records with them were on the [[Sony Classical]] label. He also founded the Silk Road Connect, involving children from middle schools in the United States, including New York City.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.silkroadproject.org/Education/SilkRoadConnect/tabid/455/Default.aspx | title=Silk Road Connect | publisher=The Silk Road Project | accessdate=March 22, 2013 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130306093701/http://www.silkroadproject.org/Education/SilkRoadConnect/tabid/455/Default.aspx | archivedate=March 6, 2013 | df=mdy-all }}</ref>

==Playing style==
Ma has been referred to as "omnivorous" by critics and possesses an eclectic repertoire.<ref>{{cite news |url  = http://www.berkshiresweek.com/062002/default.asp?filename=story1&adfile=ads4  |title = Yo-Yo Ma: Exploring culture with passion and involvement |publisher=Berkshires Week   |first=Andrew L. |last=Pincus |date = June 20, 2002 |accessdate =January 15, 2007 }}</ref> A sampling of his versatility in addition to numerous recordings of the standard classical repertoire would include his recordings of [[Baroque]] pieces using [[period instruments]]; American [[bluegrass music]]; traditional [[Music of China|Chinese melodies]], including the soundtrack to the film ''[[Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon]]''; the [[Tango music|tangos]] of Argentinian composer [[Ástor Piazzolla]]; Brazilian music, recording traditional songs and songs composed by [[Antonio Carlos Jobim]] and [[Pixinguinha]]; a collaboration with [[Bobby McFerrin]] (where Ma admitted to being terrified of the improvisation McFerrin elicited); as well as the music of modern [[minimalism|minimalist]] [[Philip Glass]] in such works as the 2002 piece ''[[Naqoyqatsi]]''.

Ma is known for his smooth, rich tone as well as his virtuosity,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/35-who-made-a-difference-yo-yo-ma-114867029/|title=35 Who Made a Difference: Yo-Yo Ma|website=Smithsonianmag.com|language=en|access-date=2019-06-16}}</ref> including a cello recording of [[Niccolò Paganini]]'s [[24th Caprice]] for solo violin and [[Zoltán Kodály]]'s [[Sonata for Solo Cello (Kodály)|solo sonata]].

==Instruments==
Ma's primary performance instrument is the cello nicknamed "Petunia", built by [[Domenico Montagnana]] in 1733, and valued at US$2.5&nbsp;million. It was named Petunia by a student who approached him after one of his classes in Salt Lake City asking if he had a nickname for his cello. He said, "No, but if I play for you, will you name it?" She chose Petunia and it stuck.<ref>{{cite news|last=Tyrangiel|first=Josh|title=10 Questions for Yo-Yo Ma|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1042474,00.html|accessdate=March 15, 2011|date=March 27, 2005|work=Time}}</ref> Yo-Yo Ma accidentally left this cello in a taxicab in New York City in 1999, but it was quickly returned undamaged.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F00914FD3D5D0C748DDDA90994D1494D81 | title=In Concert, Searchers Retrieve Yo-Yo Ma's Lost Stradivarius [sic] | work=New York Times | first=Katherine E. |last=Finkelstein | date=October 17, 1999 | accessdate=January 15, 2007}}</ref> That same year, when ''Petunia'''s neck was damaged during [[X-ray generator#Security|X-ray]] baggage inspection, he borrowed the ''[[List of Stradivarius instruments#Cellos|Pawle Stradivarius]]'' cello from the [[Chimei Museum]] for a concert in [[Taiwan]].

Another of Ma's cellos, the ''[[Davidov Stradivarius]]'', was previously owned by [[Jacqueline du Pré]], who passed it to him upon her death. Though du Pré previously voiced her frustration with the "unpredictability" of this cello, Yo-Yo Ma attributed the comment to du Pré's impassioned style of playing, adding that the Stradivarius cello must be "coaxed" by the player.<ref>{{cite book

According to research presented by [[Henry Louis Gates|Henry Louis Gates, Jr.]] for the PBS series ''[[Faces of America (PBS series)|Faces of America]]'', a relative had hidden the Ma [[genealogy book|family genealogy]] in his home in China to save it from destruction during the [[Cultural Revolution]]. His paternal ancestry can be traced back eighteen generations to the year 1217. This genealogy had been compiled in the 18th century by an ancestor, tracing everyone with the surname Ma, through the paternal line, back to one common ancestor in the 3rd century BC. Ma's [[generation name]], Yo, had been decided by his fourth great grand-uncle, Ma Ji Cang, in 1755.<ref>[https://www.pbs.org/wnet/facesofamerica/profiles/yo-yo-ma/7/ "Faces of America: Yo-Yo Ma"], PBS, ''[[Faces of America (PBS series)|Faces of America]]'' series, with [[Henry Louis Gates|Henry Louis Gates, Jr.]], 2010.</ref><ref>[http://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2010-02-09/the-mystery-of-yo-yo-mas-name/ "The Mystery of Yo-Yo Ma's Name"], Henry Louis Gates, Jr., ''The Daily Beast'', February 9, 2010.</ref>
