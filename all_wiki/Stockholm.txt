[[File:Gamla stan February 2013 01.jpg|upright=0.8|left|thumb|The Old Town of Stockholm ({{lang|sv|[[Gamla stan]]}})]]
After the Ice Age, around 8,000 BC, there were already many people living in what is today the Stockholm area, but as temperatures dropped, inhabitants moved south. Thousands of years later, as the ground thawed, the climate became tolerable and the lands became fertile, people began to migrate back to the North. At the intersection of the Baltic Sea and lake [[Mälaren]] is an archipelago site where the [[Gamla stan|Old Town]] of Stockholm was first built from about 1000 CE by Vikings. They had a positive trade impact on the area because of the trade routes they created.

Stockholm's location appears in [[Saga|Norse sagas]] as [[Agnafit]], and in [[Heimskringla]] in connection with the legendary king [[Agne]]. The earliest written mention of the name Stockholm dates from 1252, by which time the mines in [[Bergslagen]] made it an important site in the iron trade. The first part of the name ({{lang|sv|stock}}) means log in Swedish, although it may also be connected to an old German word ({{lang|de|Stock}}) meaning [[fortification]]. The second part of the name ({{lang|sv|holm}}) means islet and is thought to refer to the islet [[Helgeandsholmen]] in central Stockholm. According to the ''[[Eric Chronicles]]'' the city is said to have been founded by [[Birger Jarl]] to protect Sweden from sea invasions made by [[Karelia (historical province of Finland)|Karelians]] after the [[Sigtuna|pillage of Sigtuna]] on Lake Mälaren in the summer of 1187.<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Carlquist |first1=Erik |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2gIK29dXvMAC |title=The Chronicle of Duke Erik: A Verse Epic from Medieval Sweden |last2=Hogg |first2=Peter C. |last3=Österberg |first3=Eva |date=1 December 2011 |publisher=Nordic Academic Press |isbn=9789185509577}}</ref>

Stockholm's core, the present Old Town ({{lang|sv|[[Gamla stan|Gamla Stan]]}}) was built on the central island next to Helgeandsholmen from the mid-13th century onward. The city originally rose to prominence as a result of the Baltic trade of the [[Hanseatic League]]. Stockholm developed strong economic and cultural linkages with [[Lübeck]], [[Hamburg]], [[Gdańsk]], [[Visby]], [[Tallinn|Reval]], and [[Riga]] during this time.<ref>Retrieved from http://www.river-cities.net/pages/cities/stockholm</ref> Between 1296 and 1478 Stockholm's City Council was made up of 24 members, half of whom were selected from the town's German-speaking burghers.

The strategic and economic importance of the city made Stockholm an important factor in relations between the [[List of Danish monarchs|Danish Kings]] of the [[Kalmar Union]] and the national independence movement in the 15th century. The Danish King [[Christian II of Denmark|Christian II]] was able to enter the city in 1520. On 8 November 1520, a massacre of opposition figures called the [[Stockholm Bloodbath]] took place and set off further uprisings that eventually led to the breakup of the Kalmar Union. With the accession of [[Gustav I of Sweden|Gustav Vasa]] in 1523 and the establishment of royal power, the population of Stockholm began to grow, reaching 10,000 by 1600.

The 17th century saw Sweden grow into a major European power, reflected in the development of the city of Stockholm. From 1610 to 1680 the population multiplied sixfold. In 1634, Stockholm became the official capital of the Swedish empire. Trading rules were also created that gave Stockholm an essential monopoly over trade between foreign merchants and other Swedish and [[Scandinavia]]n territories. In 1697, [[Tre Kronor (castle)]] burned and was replaced by [[Stockholm Palace]].

In 1710, a [[Plague (disease)|plague]] [[Great Northern War plague outbreak|killed about 20,000]] (36 percent) of the population.<ref>''[https://books.google.com/books?id=sB7rtxDpeB4C&pg=PA9&dq&hl=en#v=onepage&q=&f=false Stockholm: A Cultural History]''. Tony Griffiths (2009). [[Oxford University Press]] the US. p.9. {{ISBN|0-19-538638-8}}</ref> After the end of the [[Great Northern War]] the city stagnated. Population growth halted and economic growth slowed. The city was in shock after having lost its place as the capital of a [[Great power]]. However, Stockholm maintained its role as the political center of Sweden and continued to develop culturally under [[Gustav III of Sweden|Gustav III]].

By the second half of the 19th century, Stockholm had regained its leading economic role. New industries emerged and Stockholm was transformed into an important trade and service center as well as a key gateway point within Sweden. The population also grew dramatically during this time, mainly through [[immigration]]. At the end of the 19th century, less than 40% of the residents were Stockholm-born. Settlement began to expand outside the city limits. The 19th century saw the establishment of a number of scientific institutes, including the [[Karolinska Institutet]]. The [[General Art and Industrial Exposition of Stockholm (1897)|General Art and Industrial Exposition]] was held in 1897. From 1887 to 1953 the [[Old Stockholm telephone tower]] was a landmark; originally built to link phone lines, it became redundant after these were buried, and it was latterly used for advertising.

[[File:Hoghus 1-5 2007a.jpg|thumb|Stockholm City Centre after the 1960s.]]
Stockholm became a modern, technologically advanced, and ethnically diverse city in the latter half of the 20th century. Many historical buildings were torn down during the [[modernism|modernist]] era, including substantial parts of the historical district of [[Klara (Stockholm)|Klara]], and replaced with modern architecture. However, in many other parts of Stockholm (such as in [[Gamla stan]], [[Södermalm]], [[Östermalm]], [[Kungsholmen]] and [[Vasastan, Stockholm|Vasastan]]), many "old" buildings, blocks and streets built before the modernism and [[functionalism (architecture)|functionalism]] movements took off in Sweden (around 1930–35) survived this era of demolition. Throughout the century, many industries shifted away from industrial activities into more high-tech and service industry areas.

Stockholm's metropolitan area is one of the fastest-growing regions in Europe, and its population is expected to number 2.5&nbsp;million by 2024. As a result of this massive population growth, there has been a proposal to build densely packed high-rise buildings in the city center connected by elevated walkways.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Feargus O'Sullivan |title=The Sky Walk Plan That Could Change the Face of Stockholm |url=http://www.citylab.com/design/2016/01/the-floating-sky-walk-plan-that-could-change-the-face-of-stockholm/423690/ |access-date=17 March 2016 |website=CityLab}}</ref>

=== Location ===

Stockholm is located on Sweden's east coast, where the freshwater Lake Mälaren&nbsp;— Sweden's third-largest lake&nbsp;— flows out into the Baltic Sea. The central parts of the city consist of fourteen islands that are continuous with the [[Stockholm archipelago]]. The geographical city center is situated on the water, in [[Riddarfjärden]] bay. Over 30% of the city area is made up of waterways and another 30% is made up of parks and green spaces.

Positioned at the eastern end of the [[Central Swedish lowland]], the city's location reflect the early orientation of Swedish trade toward the Baltic region.<ref name="Worldregional">{{Cite book |title=World Regional Geography |date=2009 |editor-last=Hobbs |editor-first=Joseph J. |edition=6th |page=127 |chapter=Northern Europe: Prosperous, wild and wired |isbn=978-0495389507 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yAgGHnENHjoC&q=central+swedish+lowland&pg=PA127}}</ref>

Stockholm belongs to the [[Temperate deciduous forest]] biome, which means the climate is very similar to that of the far northeastern area of the [[United States]] and coastal [[Nova Scotia]] in [[Canada]]. The average annual temperature is {{convert|7.6|°C|0|abbr=on}}. The average rainfall is {{convert|531|mm|0|abbr=on}} a year. The deciduous forest has four distinct seasons, spring, summer, autumn, and winter. In the autumn the leaves change color. During the winter months, the trees lose their leaves.

=== Stockholm Municipality ===
{{Main|Stockholm Municipality}}
Stockholm Municipality is an administrative unit defined by geographical borders. The semi-official name for the municipality is ''City of Stockholm'' (''Stockholms stad'' in Swedish).<ref>In official contexts, the municipality of Stockholm calls itself "stad" (or City), as do a small number of other Swedish municipalities, and especially the other two Swedish metropolises: [[Gothenburg]] and [[Malmö]]. However, the term "city" has administratively been discontinued in Sweden. See also [[Stad (Sweden)|city status in Sweden]]</ref> As a municipality, the City of Stockholm is subdivided into district councils, which carry responsibility for primary schools, social, leisure and cultural services within their respective areas. The municipality is usually described in terms of its three main parts: Innerstaden ([[Stockholm City Centre]]), [[Söderort]] (Southern Stockholm) and [[Västerort]] (Western Stockholm). The districts of these parts are:

The modern centre [[Norrmalm (proper)|Norrmalm]] (concentrated around the town square [[Sergels torg]]) is the largest shopping district in [[Sweden]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Norrmalm, Stockholm Travel Guide |url=https://www.oyster.com/stockholm/areas/norrmalm/ |access-date=23 April 2018 |website=www.oyster.com |language=en}}</ref> It is the most central part of Stockholm in business and shopping.

=== Climate ===

Stockholm has a [[humid continental climate]] in the 0&nbsp;°C isotherm ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Dfb'')<ref>{{Cite web |title=Klimat Stockholm: Temperatur, Klimat graf, Klimat bord |url=https://sv.climate-data.org/europa/sverige/stockholms-laen/stockholm-196/ |access-date=2019-07-02 |website=sv.climate-data.org |language=sv}}</ref><ref>{{Citation |last=Peterson |first=Adam |title=English: Köppen climate types of Sweden |date=2016-09-20 |url=https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Sweden_K%C3%B6ppen.svg |language=sv |access-date=2019-07-02}}</ref> and an [[oceanic climate]] (''Cfb'') in the -3&nbsp;°C isotherm. Although winters are cold, average temperatures generally remain above 0&nbsp;°C for much of the year. Summers are mild, and precipitation occurs throughout the year.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Das Klima der Erde {{!}} Effektive Klimaklassifikation (Köppen) |url=http://www.klima-der-erde.de/koeppen.html |access-date=2019-07-02 |website=www.klima-der-erde.de}}</ref>

Due to the city's high northerly latitude, the length of the day varies widely from more than 18 hours around midsummer to only around 6 hours in late December. The nights from late May until mid-July are bright even when cloudy. Stockholm has relatively mild weather compared to other locations at a similar latitude, or even farther south. With an average of just over 18 hours of sunshine per year, it is also one of the sunniest cities in Northern Europe, receiving more sunshine than Paris,<ref>[[Paris#Climate]]</ref> London<ref>[[London#Climate]]</ref> and a few other major European cities of a more southerly latitude. Because of the [[urban heat island]] effect and the prevailing wind traveling overland rather than sea during summer months, Stockholm has the warmest July months of the Nordic capitals. Stockholm has an annual average snow cover between 75 and 100 days.<ref>https://www.smhi.se/polopoly_fs/1.7936.1490011558!/image/p143.png_gen/derivatives/Original_1256px/image/p143.png</ref>

In spite of its mild climate, Stockholm is located further north than parts of Canada that are above the Arctic [[tree line]] at sea level.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Arctic Tree Line Map of Canada |url=https://jsis.washington.edu/canada/file/archive/taskforce09/images/canadatreeline300.jpg |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100623155423/http://jsis.washington.edu/canada/file/archive/taskforce09/images/canadatreeline300.jpg |archive-date=23 June 2010 |access-date=8 October 2015 |publisher=Jackson School of International Studies |df=dmy-all}}</ref>

Summers average daytime high temperatures of {{convert|20|-|25|C|F}} and lows of around {{convert|13|°C|°F|abbr=on}}, but temperatures can reach {{convert|30|°C|°F|abbr=on}} on some days. Days above {{convert|30|°C|0}} occur on average 1.55 days per year (1992–2011).<ref>{{Cite web |title=Stockholm&nbsp;— Bromma |url=http://data.smhi.se/met/climate/time_series/day/temperature/SMHI_day_temperature_clim_9720.txt |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120604133734/http://data.smhi.se/met/climate/time_series/day/temperature/SMHI_day_temperature_clim_9720.txt |archive-date=4 June 2012 |access-date=11 April 2014 |publisher=Data.smhi.se}}</ref> Days between {{convert|25|°C|0}} and {{convert|30|°C|0}} are relatively common especially in July and August. Night-time lows of above {{convert|20|°C|0}} are rare, and hot summer nights vary from {{convert|17|to|18|C|F}}. Winters generally bring cloudy weather with the most precipitation falling in December and January (as rain or as snow). The average winter temperatures range from {{convert|-3|to|-1|C|F}}, and occasionally drop below {{convert|-20|°C|°F|abbr=on}} in the outskirts. Spring and autumn are generally cool to mild.

The climate table below presents weather data from the years 1981–2010 although the official Köppen reference period was from 1961 to 1990. According to ongoing measurements, the temperature has increased during the years 1991–2009 as compared with the last series. This increase averages about {{convert|1.0|C-change|1}} overall months. Warming is most pronounced during the winter months, with an increase of more than {{convert|2.0|C-change|1}} in January.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Stockholm&nbsp;— Bromma |url=http://data.smhi.se/met/climate/time_series/day/temperature/SMHI_day_temperature_clim_9720.txt |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120604133734/http://data.smhi.se/met/climate/time_series/day/temperature/SMHI_day_temperature_clim_9720.txt |archive-date=4 June 2012 |access-date=1 December 2012 |publisher=Data.smhi.se}}</ref> For the 2002–2014 measurements some further increases have been found, although some months such as June have been relatively flat.

The warmest month ever recorded was July 2018 with a mean temperature of {{convert|22.5|°C|°F|abbr=on}} which is also the nationwide record.

Annual precipitation is {{convert|531|mm|in|abbr=on}} with around 170 wet days and light to moderate rainfall throughout the year. The precipitation is not uniformly distributed throughout the year. The second half of the year receives 50% more than the first half. Snowfall occurs mainly from December through March. Snowfall may occasionally occur in late October as well as in April.

In Stockholm, the [[aurora borealis]] can occasionally be observed.

=== Daylight hours ===
Stockholm's location just south of the 60th parallel north means that the number of daylight hours is relatively small during winter&nbsp;– about six hours&nbsp;– while in June and the first half of July, the nights are relatively short, with about 18 hours of daylight. Around the [[summer solstice]] the sun never reaches further below the [[horizon]] than 7.3 degrees.<ref>''Svenska Almanackan'' published on an annual basis since 1906 by Almanacksförlaget (which holds a [[List of Royal Warrant Holders of the Swedish court|Royal warrant]]) in cooperation with Stockholm's Observatory. Valid for latitude 59 degrees and 21 minutes north (and longitude 12 time minutes east of the Swedish time meridian, which is 15 degrees East)</ref> This gives the sky a bright blue colour in summer once the sun has set because it does not get any darker than [[nautical twilight]]. Also, when looking straight up towards the [[zenith]], few stars are visible after the sun has gone down. This is not to be confused with the [[midnight sun]], which occurs north of the [[Arctic Circle]], around 7 degrees farther north.

[[File:Rådsalen 2009a.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.15|The municipal council chamber ({{lang-sv|Rådssalen}}), inside [[Stockholm City Hall]].]]
The Stockholm [[Municipal council (Sweden)|Municipal Council]] ({{lang-sv|Stockholms kommunfullmäktige}}) is the name of the local assembly. Its 101 councillors are elected concurrently with [[Elections in Sweden|general elections]], held at the same time as the elections to the [[Riksdag]] and [[County councils of Sweden|county councils]]. The Council convenes twice every month at [[Stockholm City Hall]], and the meetings are open to the public. The matters on which the councillors decide have generally already been drafted and discussed by various boards and committees. Once decisions are referred for practical implementation, the employees of the City administrations and companies take over.<ref name="Governance">{{Cite web |title=City Governance |url=http://international.stockholm.se/governance/ |access-date=23 July 2014 |publisher=Stockholm City}}</ref>

The elected majority has a Mayor and eight Vice Mayors. The Mayor and each majority Vice Mayor is the head of a department, with responsibility for a particular area of operation, such as City Planning. The opposition also has four Vice Mayors, but they hold no executive power. Together the Mayor and the 12 Vice Mayors form the Council of Mayors, and they prepare matters for the City Executive Board. The Mayor holds a special position among the Vice Mayors, chairing both the Council of Mayors and the City Executive Board.<ref name="Governance" />

The City Executive Board ({{lang-sv|[[Kommunstyrelsen]]}}) is elected by the City Council and is equivalent to a [[Cabinet (government)|cabinet]]. The City Executive Board renders an opinion in all matters decided by the council and bears the overall responsibility for follow-up, evaluation and execution of its decisions. The Board is also responsible for financial administration and long-term development. The City Executive Board consists of 13 members, who represent both the majority and the opposition. Its meetings are not open to the public.<ref name="Governance" />

Following the [[2018 Stockholm municipal election]] a majority of seats in the municipal council is at present held by a center/right-wing majority and the [[List of municipal commissioners for finance of Stockholm|Mayor of Stockholm]] ({{lang-sv|Finansborgarråd}}) is [[Anna Konig Jerlmyr]] from the [[Moderate Party]].

The vast majority of Stockholm residents work in the service industry, which accounts for roughly 85% of jobs in Stockholm. The almost total absence of heavy industry (and fossil fuel power plants) makes Stockholm one of the world's cleanest [[metropolis]]es. The last decade has seen a significant number of jobs created in [[high tech]]nology companies. Large employers include [[IBM]], [[Ericsson]], and [[Electrolux]]. A major IT centre is located in [[Kista]], in northern Stockholm.

Stockholm is Sweden's financial centre. Major Swedish banks, such as [[Swedbank]], [[Handelsbanken]], and [[SEB Group|SEB]], are headquartered in Stockholm, as are the major insurance companies [[Skandia]], [[Folksam]] and [[Codan A/S|Trygg-Hansa]]. Stockholm is also home to Sweden's foremost stock exchange, the [[Stockholm Stock Exchange]] (''Stockholmsbörsen''). Additionally, about 45% of Swedish companies with more than 200 employees are headquartered in Stockholm.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Fakta om företagandet i Stockholm – 2012. page 18, Stockholm Business Region website |url=http://www.stockholmbusinessregion.se/Global/N%C3%A4ringslivsservice/Publikationer/Fakta%20om%20f%C3%B6retagandet%20i%20Stockholm%202012.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120719145448/http://www.stockholmbusinessregion.se/Global/N%C3%A4ringslivsservice/Publikationer/Fakta%20om%20f%C3%B6retagandet%20i%20Stockholm%202012.pdf |archive-date=19 July 2012 |access-date=19 May 2012 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> Noted clothes retailer [[H&M]] is also headquartered in the city. In recent years, tourism has played an important part in the city's economy. [[Stockholm County]] is ranked as the 10th largest visitor destination in Europe, with over 10&nbsp;million commercial overnight stays per year. Among 44 European cities, Stockholm had the 6th highest growth in the number of nights spent in the period 2004–2008.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Fakta om företagandet i Stockholm – 2012. page 6, Stockholm Business Region website |url=http://www.stockholmbusinessregion.se/Global/N%C3%A4ringslivsservice/Publikationer/Fakta%20om%20f%C3%B6retagandet%20i%20Stockholm%202012.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120719145448/http://www.stockholmbusinessregion.se/Global/N%C3%A4ringslivsservice/Publikationer/Fakta%20om%20f%C3%B6retagandet%20i%20Stockholm%202012.pdf |archive-date=19 July 2012 |access-date=19 May 2012 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>

== Fibre optic network ==
The city-owned company Stokab started in 1994 to build a fiber-optic network throughout the municipality as a level playing field for all operators (City of Stockholm, 2011). Around a decade later, the network was {{convert|1.2|e6km|e6mi|1|abbr=off}} long making it the longest optic fiber network in the world and now has over 90 operators and 450 enterprises as customers. 2011 was the final year of a three-year project which brought fiber to 100% of public housing, meaning an extra 95,000 houses were added. (City of Stockholm, 2011)

== Education ==
{{Main|Education in Stockholm}}
[[File:Sse north side.jpg|thumb|left|[[Stockholm School of Economics]]]]
Research and higher education in the sciences started in Stockholm in the 18th century, with education in medicine and various research institutions such as the [[Stockholm Observatory]]. The medical education was eventually formalized in 1811 as [[Karolinska Institute]]t. [[KTH Royal Institute of Technology]] (''Swedish: Kungliga Tekniska högskolan'') was founded in 1827 and is Scandinavia's largest higher education institute of technology with 13,000 students. [[Stockholm University]], founded in 1878 with university status granted in 1960, has 52,000 students {{As of|2008|lc=y}}. It also incorporates historical institutions, such as the Observatory, the [[Swedish Museum of Natural History]], and the botanical garden ''[[Bergianska trädgården]]''. The [[Stockholm School of Economics]], founded in 1909, is one of the few private institutions of higher education in Sweden.

In the [[fine art]]s, educational institutions include the [[Royal College of Music, Stockholm|Royal College of Music]], which has a history going back to the conservatory founded as part of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Music]] in 1771, the [[Royal Institute of Art|Royal University College of Fine Arts]], which has a similar historical association with the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Arts]] and a foundation date of 1735, and the [[Swedish National Academy of Mime and Acting]], which is the continuation of the school of the [[Royal Dramatic Theatre]], once attended by [[Greta Garbo]]. Other schools include the design school [[Konstfack]], founded in 1844, the [[University College of Opera]] (founded in 1968 but with older roots), the [[University of Dance and Circus|University College of Dance]], and the ''[[Stockholms Musikpedagogiska Institut]]'' (the University College of Music Education).

The [[Södertörn College|Södertörn University College]] was founded in 1995 as a multi-disciplinary institution for southern [[Metropolitan Stockholm]], to balance the many institutions located in the northern part of the region.

Other institutes of higher education are:
* [[Military Academy Karlberg]], the world's oldest military academy to remain in its original location, inaugurated in 1792 and housed in [[Karlberg Palace]].
* [[Ersta Sköndal University College]]
* [[Stockholm School of Theology]] (''Teologiska Högskolan, Stockholm'')
* [[Swedish School of Sport and Health Sciences]]
* [[Swedish Defence University]]

The biggest complaint from students of higher education in Stockholm is the lack of student accommodations, the difficulty in finding other accommodations and the high rent.<ref>{{Cite web |date=11 May 2012 |title=Stockholm University&nbsp;— Find Housing On Your Own |url=http://www.su.se/english/study/exchange-students/housing/find-housing-on-your-own |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120504031348/http://www.su.se/english/study/exchange-students/housing/find-housing-on-your-own |archive-date=4 May 2012 |access-date=19 May 2012 |publisher=Su.se}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Emerging housing crisis for students |url=http://www.stockholmnews.com/more.aspx?NID=5690 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120429155812/http://www.stockholmnews.com/more.aspx?NID=5690 |archive-date=29 April 2012 |access-date=19 May 2012 |publisher=Stockholmnews.com |df=dmy-all}}</ref>

By the turn of the 19th century, Stockholm largely consisted of the area today known as City Centre, roughly {{convert|35|km2|sqmi||abbr=on}} or one-fifth of the current municipal area. In the ensuing decades several other areas were incorporated (such as [[Brännkyrka]] Municipality in 1913, at which time it had 25,000 inhabitants, and [[Spånga]] in 1949). The municipal border was established in 1971; with the exception of Hansta, in 1982 purchased by Stockholm Municipality from Sollentuna Municipality and today a nature reserve.<ref name="SthlmStatistic2006">[https://web.archive.org/web/20060926135005/http://www.stockholm.se/Extern/Templates/Page.aspx?id=76458 Stockholm Statistical Yearbook, 2006 (''Stockholms statistiska årsbok för 2006'')] City of Stockholm website, May 2006.

== Culture ==
Apart from being Sweden's capital, Stockholm houses many national cultural institutions. The Stockholm region is home to three of Sweden's [[World Heritage Site]]s&nbsp;– spots judged as invaluable places that belong to all of humanity: The [[Drottningholm Palace]], [[Skogskyrkogården]] (The Woodland Cemetery) and [[Birka]].<ref name="Drottningholm" /><ref>{{Cite web |title=Three world heritage sites |url=http://www.visitstockholm.com/en/To-Do/Tips/Three-world-heritage-sites/ |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140219115856/http://www.visitstockholm.com/en/To-Do/Tips/Three-world-heritage-sites/ |archive-date=19 February 2014 |access-date=2 February 2014 |publisher=Stockholm Visitors Board}}</ref><ref name="Skogskyrkogården">{{Cite web |title=World Heritage Skogskyrkogården |url=http://www.skogskyrkogarden.se/en/ |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140109040448/http://www.skogskyrkogarden.se/en/ |archive-date=9 January 2014 |access-date=2 February 2014 |publisher=The Stockholm City Museum}}</ref> In 1998, Stockholm was named [[European Capital of Culture]].

=== Literature ===
Authors connected to Stockholm include the poet and songwriter [[Carl Michael Bellman]] (1740–1795), novelist and dramatist [[August Strindberg]] (1849–1912), and novelist [[Hjalmar Söderberg]] (1869–1941), all of whom made Stockholm part of their works.

Martin Beck is a fictional Swedish police detective from Stockholm, who is the main character in a series of 10 novels by Maj Sjöwall and Per Wahlöö, collectively titled The Story of a Crime, and often based in Stockholm.

Other authors with notable heritage in Stockholm were the [[Nobel Prize in Literature|Nobel Prize laureate]] [[Eyvind Johnson]] (1900–1976) and the popular poet and composer [[Evert Taube]] (1890–1976). The novelist [[Per Anders Fogelström]] (1917–1998) wrote a popular series of historical novels depicting life in Stockholm from the mid-18th to the mid-20th century.

[[File:Look from Erricson globe, stockholm.png|thumb|Look at Stockholm from Ericsson globe]]

The city's oldest section is Gamla stan (Old Town), located on the original small islands of the city's earliest settlements and still featuring the [[Middle Ages|medieval]] street layout. Some notable buildings of Gamla Stan are the large German Church (''Tyska kyrkan'') and several mansions and palaces: the ''[[Swedish House of Nobility|Riddarhuset]]'' (the House of Nobility), the [[Bonde Palace]], the [[Tessin Palace]] and the [[Axel Oxenstierna palace|Oxenstierna Palace]].

The oldest building in Stockholm is the [[Riddarholm Church|Riddarholmskyrkan]] from the late 13th century. After a fire in 1697 when the original medieval castle was destroyed, [[Stockholm Palace]] was erected in a [[baroque]] style. [[Storkyrkan]] Cathedral, the episcopal seat of the Bishop of Stockholm, stands next to the castle. It was founded in the 13th century but is clad in a baroque exterior dating to the 18th century.

As early as the 15th century, the city had expanded outside of its original borders. Some pre-industrial, small-scale buildings from this era can still be found in [[Södermalm]]. During the 19th century and the age of industrialization Stockholm grew rapidly, with plans and architecture inspired by the large cities of the continent such as [[Berlin]] and [[Vienna]]. Notable works of this time period include public buildings such as the [[Royal Swedish Opera]] and private developments such as the luxury housing developments on [[Strandvägen]].

In the 20th century, a nationalistic push spurred a new architectural style inspired by medieval and renaissance ancestry as well as influences of the [[Art Nouveau|Jugend]]/Art Nouveau style. A key landmark of Stockholm, the Stockholm City Hall, was erected 1911–1923 by architect [[Ragnar Östberg]]. Other notable works of these times are the [[Stockholm Public Library]] and the [[World Heritage Site]] [[Skogskyrkogården]].<ref name="Skogskyrkogården" />

[[File:Sodertornet at night.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|[[Söder Torn]], an {{convert|86|m|ft|0|adj=mid|abbr=off|-tall}} building in Södermalm.]]
In the 1930s modernism characterized the development of the city as it grew. New residential areas sprang up such as the development on [[Gärdet]] while industrial development added to the growth, such as the KF manufacturing industries on Kvarnholmen located in the Nacka Municipality. In the 1950s, suburban development entered a new phase with the introduction of the [[Stockholm metro]]. The modernist developments of [[Vällingby]] and [[Farsta]] were internationally praised. In the 1960s this suburban development continued but with the aesthetic of the times, the industrialized and mass-produced blocks of flats received a large amount of criticism.

At the same time that this suburban development was taking place, the most central areas of the inner city were being redesigned, known as ''[[Redevelopment of Norrmalm|Norrmalmsregleringen]]''. [[Sergels Torg]], with its five high-rise office towers was created in the 1960s, followed by the total clearance of large areas to make room for new development projects. The most notable buildings from this period include the ensemble of the [[The House of Culture (Stockholm)|House of Culture]], [[Stockholm City Theatre|City Theatre]] and the [[Sveriges Riksbank|Riksbank]] at Sergels Torg, designed by architect [[Peter Celsing]].

In the 1980s, the planning ideas of modernism were starting to be questioned, resulting in suburbs with denser planning, such as [[Skarpnäck (borough)|Skarpnäck]]. In the 1990s this idea was taken further with the development of an old industrial area close to the inner city, resulting in a sort of mix of modernistic and urban planning{{clarify|date=January 2017}} in the new area of [[Hammarby Sjöstad]].

The municipality has appointed an official "board of beauty" called "[[Stockholm Beauty Council|Skönhetsrådet]]" to protect and preserve the beauty of the city.<ref>{{Cite web |date=17 February 2012 |title=Skönhetsrådet |url=http://www.stockholm.se/skonhetsradet |access-date=19 May 2012 |publisher=Stockholm.se}}</ref>

The [[Vasa Museum]] ({{lang-sv|Vasamuseet}}) is a [[maritime museum]] on [[Djurgården]] which displays the only almost fully intact 17th century [[ship]] that has ever been salvaged, the 64-gun warship ''[[Vasa (ship)|Vasa]]'' that sank on her [[maiden voyage]] in 1628.

The [[Nationalmuseum]] houses the largest collection of art in the country: 16,000 paintings and 30,000 objects of art handicraft. The collection dates back to the days of Gustav Vasa in the 16th century, and has since been expanded with works by artists such as [[Rembrandt]], and [[Jean-Antoine Watteau|Antoine Watteau]], as well as constituting a main part of Sweden's art heritage, manifested in the works of [[Alexander Roslin]], [[Anders Zorn]], [[Johan Tobias Sergel]], [[Carl Larsson]], [[Carl Fredrik Hill]] and [[Ernst Josephson]]. From the year 2013 to 2018 the museum was closed due to a restoration of the building.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Anderson |first=Christina |date=October 12, 2018 |title=A Restoration Brings Sweden's Nationalmuseum Into the 21st Century |work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/12/arts/design/nationalmuseum-stockholm-reopening.html}}</ref>

=== Art galleries ===
Stockholm has a vibrant art scene with a number of internationally recognized art centres and commercial galleries. Amongst others, privately sponsored initiatives such as [[Bonnier Group|Bonniers]] Konsthall, Magasin 3, and state-supported institutions such as [[Tensta Konsthall]] and Index all show leading international and national artists. In the last few years, a gallery district has emerged around Hudiksvallsgatan where leading galleries such as Andréhn-Schiptjenko, Brändström & Stene have located. Other important commercial galleries include Nordenhake, [[Milliken Gallery]] and Galleri Magnus Karlsson.

=== Suburbs ===
The Stockholm suburbs are places with diverse cultural background. Some areas in the inner suburbs, including those of [[Skärholmen]], [[Tensta]], [[Jordbro]], [[Fittja]], [[Husby, Stockholm|Husby]], [[Brandbergen]], [[Rinkeby]], [[Rissne]], [[Kista]], [[Hagsätra]], [[Hässelby]], [[Farsta (borough)|Farsta]], [[Rågsved]], [[Flemingsberg]], and the outer suburb of [[Södertälje]], have high percentages of immigrants or second generation immigrants.

=== Air quality ===
Stockholm used to have problematic levels of particulates (PM10) due to studded winter tires, but as of 2016 the levels are below limits, after street-specific bans. Instead the current (2016) problem is nitrogen oxides emitted by diesel vehicles. In 2016 the average levels for urban background (roof of Torkel Knutssonsgatan) were: [[Nitrogen dioxide|NO<sub>2</sub>]] 11 μg/m<sup>3</sup>, [[NOx|NO<sub>x</sub>]] 14 μg/m<sup>3</sup>, [[Particulates|PM10]] 12 μg/m<sup>3</sup>, PM2.5 4.9 μg/m<sup>3</sup>, [[soot]] 0.4 μg/m<sup>3</sup>, [[ultrafine particle]]s 6200/cm<sup>3</sup>, [[Carbon monoxide|CO]] 0.2&nbsp;mg/m<sup>3</sup>, [[Sulfur dioxide|SO<sub>2</sub>]] 0.4 μg/m<sup>3</sup>, [[ozone]] 51 μg/m<sup>3</sup>.

== Transport ==

=== Public Transportation ===
{{Main|Public transport in Stockholm}}
[[File:SL C20 Gamla Stan, Stockholm.jpg|thumb|right|A southbound full-length (3 car) [[Bombardier C20|C20 metrotrain]] departing from the [[Gamla stan metro station|Gamla stan station]].]]

Stockholm has an extensive [[public transport]] system. It consists of the [[Stockholm Metro]] ({{lang-sv|Tunnelbanan}}), which consist of three color-coded main systems (green, red and blue) with seven lines (10, 11, 13, 14, 17, 18, 19); the [[Stockholm commuter rail]] ({{lang-sv|Pendeltågen}}) which runs on the state-owned railroads on six lines (40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 48); four [[Trams in Stockholm|light rail/tramway lines]] ([[Spårväg City|7]], [[Nockebybanan|12]], [[Lidingöbanan|21]], and [[Tvärbanan|22]]); the [[Swedish three foot gauge railways|891 mm]] [[narrow-gauge railway]] [[Roslagsbanan]], on three lines (27, 28, 29) in the northeastern part; the local railway [[Saltsjöbanan]], on two lines (25, 26) in the southeastern part; a large number of bus lines, and the inner-city [[Djurgården ferry]]. The overwhelming majority of the land-based public transport in Stockholm County (save for the airport buses/[[Arlanda Express|airport express trains]] and other few commercially viable bus lines) is organized under the common umbrella of [[Storstockholms Lokaltrafik]] (SL), an [[aktiebolag]] wholly owned by [[Stockholm County Council]]. Since the 1990s, the operation and maintenance of the SL public transport services are contracted out to independent companies bidding for contracts, such as [[MTR Corporation|MTR]], which operate the Metro. The archipelago boat traffic is handled by [[Waxholmsbolaget]], which is also wholly owned by the County Council.

[[File:Number 7 tram bound for Sergels Torg in Stockholm Sweden.png|left|thumb|upright=0.9|An [[Bombardier Flexity Classic|A34 tram]] on [[Spårväg City|line 7]] at [[Djurgårdsbron]]]]
SL has a common ticket system in the entire Stockholm County, which allows for easy travel between different modes of transport. The tickets are of two main types, single ticket and [[travel card]]s, both allowing for unlimited travel with SL in the entire Stockholm County for the duration of the ticket validity. On 1 April 2007, a zone system (A, B, C) and price system was introduced. Single tickets were available in forms of cash ticket, individual unit pre-paid tickets, pre-paid ticket slips of 8, sms-ticket and machine ticket. Cash tickets bought at the point of travel were the most expensive and pre-paid tickets slips of 8 are the cheapest. A single ticket costs 32 SEK with the card and 45 SEK without and is valid for 75 minutes. The duration of the travel card validity depended on the exact type; they were available from 24 hours up to a year. As of 2018, a 30-day card costs 860&nbsp;SEK. Tickets of all these types were available with reduced prices for students and persons under 20 and over 65 years of age. On 9 January 2017, the zone system was removed, and the cost of the tickets was increased.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Archived copy |url=http://sl.se/sv/info/nyheter/nya-priser-2017/?date=true |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170319115629/http://sl.se/sv/info/nyheter/nya-priser-2017/?date=true |archive-date=19 March 2017 |access-date=2017-03-19 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>

==== The City Line Project ====
{{Main|Stockholm City Line}}
With an estimated cost of SEK 16.8&nbsp;billion (January 2007 price level), which equals 2.44&nbsp;billion US dollars, the [[Stockholm City Line|City Line]], an environmentally certified project, comprises a {{convert|6|km|abbr=on}}-long commuter train tunnel (in rock and water) beneath Stockholm, with two new stations (Stockholm City and Stockholm Odenplan), and a {{convert|1.4|km|abbr=on}}-long railway bridge at [[Enskede-Årsta|Årsta]]. The City Line was built by the Swedish Transport Administration in co-operation with the City of Stockholm, Stockholm County Council, and Stockholm Transport, SL. As [[Stockholm Central Station]] is overloaded, the purpose of this project was to double the city's track capacity and improve service efficiency. Operations began in July 2017.<ref name="trafikverket1">{{Cite web |title=The Stockholm City Line |url=http://www.trafikverket.se/en/startpage/projects/Railway-construction-projects/The-Stockholm-City-Line/ |access-date=28 July 2017 |publisher=[[Swedish Transport Administration]] |df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{Cite magazine |last=Barrow |first=Keith |date=10 July 2017 |title=Stockholm City Line opens |url=http://www.railjournal.com/index.php/commuter-rail/stockholm-city-line-opens.html |magazine=[[International Railway Journal]] |access-date=28 July 2017}}</ref>

Between [[Riddarholmen]] and Söder Mälarstrand, the City Line runs through a submerged concrete tunnel.<ref name="trafikverket1" /> As a green project, the City Line includes the purification of waste water; noise reduction through sound-attenuating tracks; the use of synthetic diesel, which provides users with clean air; and the recycling of excavated rocks.<ref name="trafikverket1" />

=== Roads ===
[[File:Norra Länken nov 2016.jpg|thumb|[[Norra länken]] (North link) motorway in Stockholm.]]
Stockholm is at the junction of the [[International E-road network|European routes]] [[European route E4|E4]], [[European route E18|E18]] and [[European route E20|E20]]. A [[Stockholm Ring Road|half-completed motorway ring road]] exists on the south, west and north sides of the City Centre. The northern section of the ring road, Norra Länken, opened for traffic in 2015 while the final subsea eastern section is being discussed as a future project. A bypass motorway for traffic between Northern and Southern Sweden, [[Förbifart Stockholm]], is being built. The many islands and waterways make extensions of the road system both complicated and expensive, and new motorways are often built as systems of tunnels and bridges.

==== Congestion charges ====

After the trial period was over, consultative referendums were held in Stockholm Municipality and several other municipalities in Stockholm County. The then-reigning government ([[Persson Cabinet]]) stated that they would only take into consideration the results of the referendum in [[Stockholm Municipality]]. The opposition parties ([[Alliance (Sweden)|Alliance for Sweden]]) stated that if they were to form a cabinet after the [[2006 Swedish general election|general election]]—which was held the same day as the congestion tax referendums—they would take into consideration the referendums held in several of the other municipalities in [[Stockholm County]] as well. The results of the referendums were that the Stockholm Municipality voted for the congestion tax, while the other municipalities voted against it. The opposition parties won the general election and a few days before they formed government ([[Reinfeldt Cabinet]]) they announced that the congestion tax would be reintroduced in Stockholm, but that the revenue would go entirely to road construction in and around Stockholm. During the trial period and according to the agenda of the previous government the revenue went entirely to public transport.

=== Ferries ===
