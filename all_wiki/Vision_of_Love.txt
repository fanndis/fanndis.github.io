"'''Vision of Love'''" is the debut single by American singer-songwriter [[Mariah Carey]]. Written by Carey and [[Ben Margulies]], "Vision of Love" was released as the lead single from Carey's [[Mariah Carey (album)|self-titled]] debut album on May 15, 1990. After being featured on Carey's demo tape for [[Columbia Records|Columbia]], the song was re-recorded and produced by [[Rhett Lawrence]] and [[Narada Michael Walden]]. "Vision of Love" features a slow-dance theme tempo and backing vocals sung by Carey herself, and introduces her usage of the [[whistle register]]. Lyrically, the song describes both a past and present relationship with a lover: Carey describes the "vision of love" she dreamed of, as well as the present love she feels for him.

The accompanying  [[music video]] for "Vision of Love" was filmed in April 1990. It features Carey in a large cathedral, where she meditates and sings by a large picture window. "Vision of Love" was performed on several television and award show ceremonies, such as ''[[The Arsenio Hall Show]]'', ''[[Good Morning America]]'', and the [[33rd Grammy Awards|33rd Annual]] [[Grammy Award]]s. It has been performed at almost every one of Carey's concerts and tours, and is featured on Carey's live album ''[[MTV Unplugged (Mariah Carey EP)|MTV Unplugged]]'' (1992) and on many of her compilation albums, ''[[Number 1's (Mariah Carey album)|Number 1's]]'' (1998), ''[[Greatest Hits (Mariah Carey album)|Greatest Hits]]'' (2001) and ''[[The Ballads (Mariah Carey album)|The Ballads]]'' (2008).

"Vision of Love" received universal acclaim from music critics. While the song's production was typical of late 1980s pop, the vocals were not, being much more showy and expressing a wider range than artists popular at the time such as [[Paula Abdul]] and [[Debbie Gibson]]. It has been credited with popularizing the use of [[melisma]] in contemporary popular music and for inspiring several artists to pursue a music career. ''[[The New Yorker]]'' named "Vision of Love" the "[[Magna Carta]] of melisma" for its and Carey's influence on pop and R&B singers and ''[[American Idol]]'' contestants.<ref name="newyorker"/> Additionally, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' said that "the fluttering strings of notes that decorate songs like "Vision of Love," inspired the entire ''American Idol'' vocal school, for better or worse, and virtually every other female R&B singer since the nineties."<ref name=RollingStone-Nov2008/> The song topped the singles charts in Canada, New Zealand, and the United States, where it spent four weeks atop the chart.

==Background and recording==
Throughout 1986, Carey had already begun writing music while in high school.<ref name="bronson">{{harvnb|Bronson|2003|p=762}}</ref> After composing a song with her friend, [[Gavin Christopher]] (of "[[Once You Get Started]]" fame), Carey met a young drummer and songwriter, [[Ben Margulies]]. After initially meeting and becoming friends, the pair began spending time in his father's old studio, writing material and composing new songs.<ref name="bronson"/> Together, the first song they compiled was titled "Here We Go Around Again." As the year wore on, they had composed seven songs for Carey's demo tape; of them was the rough and unfinished version of "Vision of Love".<ref name="bronson"/> In an interview with [[Fred Bronson]], Carey described how she met and came to work with Margulies.
<blockquote>
"We needed someone to play keyboards for a song I did with Gavin Christopher. We called someone and he couldn't come, so by accident we stumbled on Ben. Ben came to the session, and he can't really play keyboards very well-he's really more of a drummer-but after that day, we kept in touch, and we just sort of clicked as writers.<ref name="bronson"/>
</blockquote>
After meeting [[Brenda K. Starr]] and being introduced to [[Tommy Mottola]], the future head of [[Sony Music Entertainment]] (as well as Carey's future husband), the song was re-done in a professional studio, with the assistance of two producers.<ref name="bronson"/> Carey flew to Los Angeles to work with [[Rhett Lawrence]], one of the album's main producers. After hearing the original version of the song, Lawrence described it as having a "'50s sort of shuffle."<ref name="bronson"/> After Carey agreed to alter the song, Lawrence contemporized its tempo.<ref name=allmusic>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/song/t845926|title=Vision of Love: Song Review|last=Hogan|first=Ed|work=[[Allmusic]]|publisher=[[Rovi Corporation]]|access-date=January 1, 2011}}</ref> "Vision of Love" was recorded at the Skyline Studios in New York, and featured Lawrence behind the keyboard, Margulies on the drums, bassist [[Marcus Miller]], drum programmer Ren Klyce and guitarist [[Jimmy Ripp]].<ref name=allmusic/> Lawrence took Carey's vocals from the original demo version, and used them as background vocals for the song's final version. After adding different instrumentation to the song, Lawrence and [[Narada Michael Walden]] produced "Vision of Love."<ref name=allmusic/>

"Vision of Love" is a [[pop music|pop]]/[[Contemporary R&B|R&B]]<ref name="billboard"/> love song with gospel and soul influences. It incorporates heavy backup vocals during the song's [[bridge (music)|bridge]] and features usage of Carey's [[whistle register]] and [[melisma]].<ref name="nickson2">{{harvnb|Nickson|1998|p=37}}</ref> Author Chris Nickson described the song and its vocals:
<blockquote>
"['Vision of Love'] was the perfect introduction to her voice. With an ideal slow-dancing tempo, it still managed to swing, with Mariah's background vocals (herself multi-tracked) answering her lead. On the final chorus, her voice flew towards those trademark high notes before the instruments drop out, leaving Mariah to sing her way out to the tune's climax alone."<ref name="nickson2"/>
</blockquote>

"Vision of Love" is set in [[Time signature|common time]] and in the [[Key (music)|key]] of [[C major]].<ref name=sheet>{{cite web|url=http://www.musicnotes.com/sheetmusic/mtdVPE.asp?ppn=MN0055082|title=Mariah Carey – Vision of Love – Digital Sheet Music|work=Musicnotes.com|publisher=[[Alfred Music Publishing|Alfred Publishing]]|access-date=May 5, 2009}}</ref> Carey's vocal range spans from the low-note of E{{music|flat}}<sub>3</sub> to the high whistle note of C<sub>7</sub>. The song's lyrics and melody were written and composed by Carey, with Margulies, Miller, Klyce and Rip on the instrumentals. Lawrence and Walden produced the song, which heavily deviated from its original version on Carey's demo.<ref name=allmusic/> Michael Slezak from ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' wrote regarding the song's instrumentation and vocals "From those opening sci-fi-esque synths to that signature dog-whistle high note, Mariah's very first single is inspired: Even folks who object to her trademark vocal excesses are hard-pressed to fault this rousing, gospel-tinged song about finding 'the one that I needed.'"<ref name=gem/>

==Lyrical content==
The song's lyrics have been subject to various interpretations and suggested relationships by critics.<ref name="nickson2"/> Some have noted the relationship between Carey and God, while others point out one with a lover. Carey has yielded to both, while claiming them to have a connection to her childhood and to obstacles encountered while growing up. Michael Slezak wrote "Though it's not clear if she's celebrating a secular love or her relationship with a higher power, this exuberant ballad is a near-religious listening experience."<ref name=gem/> In an interview with ''[[Ebony (magazine)|Ebony]]'' in 1991, Carey spoke of the song's lyrics and success.
<blockquote>
"Consider the lyrics: Prayed through the nights / Felt so alone / Suffered from alienation / Carried the weight on my own / Had to be strong / So I believed / And now I know I've succeeded / In finding the place I conceived. Well, just because you are young doesn't mean that you haven't had a hard life. It's been difficult for me, moving around so much, having to grow up by myself, basically on my own, my parents divorced. And I always felt kind of different from everyone else in my neighborhoods. I was a different person – ethnically. And sometimes that can be a problem. If you look a certain way everybody goes, 'White girl,' and I'd go, 'No, that's not what I am.'"<ref name=vibeinterview>{{cite journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xcwDAAAAMBAJ|title=Not Another White Girl Trying to Sing Black|last=Norment|first=Lynn|journal=[[Ebony (magazine)|Ebony]]|publisher=[[Johnson Publishing Company]]|page =58|date=March 1991|access-date=September 28, 2010}}</ref>
</blockquote>
According to Nickson, Carey chose to express her innermost feelings in her songs rather than becoming depressed and bitter throughout the hardships in her life. "You really have to look inside yourself and find your own inner strength, and say, `I'm proud of what I am and who I am, and I'm just going to be myself."<ref name=vibeinterview/>

==Critical reception==
"Vision of Love" received universal acclaim from music critics, who mostly complimented its lyrical content as well as [[Mariah Carey|Carey]]'s vocals and use of [[melisma]]. Bill Lamb from [[About.com]] stated that "echoes of [[Whitney Houston]]'s influence are evident, but the sheer power and swooping highs are all Mariah's own."<ref>{{cite web|author=Lamb, Bill|url=https://www.liveabout.com/top-songs-from-the-90s-3245307|title=The Best 100 Songs From the 1990s|publisher=[[About.com]]|date=September 7, 2019|access-date=April 8, 2020}}</ref> He added that "Vision of Love" is "one of the best songs" of the singer's recording career, and "simply one of the most stunning debut releases ever by a pop recording artist."<ref>{{cite web|last=Lamb|first=Bill| title=Mariah Carey|work =About.com|publisher=The New York Times Company|url=http://top40.about.com/od/reviews/gr/mcareyfirst.htm|access-date=August 30, 2008}}</ref> Ashley S.

Also Juzwiak complimented the usage of the whistle register in the song, "And then there's the whistle note. And then there's the final vocal run that's more like a roller-coaster track.

If it costs a few extra dollars to make a splash in terms of the right imaging, you go ahead and do it."<ref name="nickson"/>

===Synopsis===
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Mariah Carey - Vision of Love Original shot 1.png|thumb|230px|Carey as she appears in her debut music video.]] -->
The video takes place in a large cathedral-like room, with large winding staircases on each side. Throughout the video, the scenery changes several times from a cloudy and sunny day, to a glowing sunset. These time shifts are seen through a large carved window in the cathedral. The video begins with Carey's hair in long golden curls, and her wearing a skin-tight black jumper. She sits on the large ledge by the window, staring into the different colors in the sky. As the video progresses, Carey is joined by a small black cat, which accompanies her as she meditates on the large stairwell. After the song's second verse, a large microphone is seen in the middle of the room, where scenes of Carey singing and standing on the window's ledge interchange. The last scenes show Carey staring out into the meadow, smiling. According to author Chris Nickson, during the scenes of Carey by the large window, it is "obvious" that she is praying to God and connecting to her creator. He felt that alongside the song's lyrics of faith and prayer, the video's moments of meditation truly went "hand in hand."<ref name="nickson"/>
