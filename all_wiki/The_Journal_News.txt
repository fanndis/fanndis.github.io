'''''The Journal News''''' is a [[newspaper]] in [[New York (state)|New York State]] serving the New York counties of [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]], [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland]], and [[Putnam County, New York|Putnam]], a region known as the [[Hudson Valley|Lower Hudson Valley]]. It is owned by [[Gannett]].

''The Journal News'' was created through a [[merger]] of several daily community newspapers serving the three counties.{{citation needed lead|date=May 2013}}
Although the current newspaper's name comes from the ''Rockland Journal-News'', which was based in [[West Nyack, New York]], and served Rockland County, the ''Rockland Journal-News'' was actually the third-largest newspaper that Gannett merged to create the larger newspaper. ''The Reporter Dispatch'' from White Plains, New York, and the ''Herald Statesman'' in [[Yonkers]] were larger and served Westchester County. For years prior to the October 12, 1998, merger that created ''The Journal News'', ten of the newspapers shared some content and printing presses, although the ''Rockland Journal-News'', formerly ''The Journal-News'', the ''Rockland County Evening Journal'' and the ''Nyack Evening Journal'', operated its own full composing room and printing press until fall 1996. The ''Rockland Journal-News'' had an independent staff of editors, writers, photographers, an artist, etc., from the time of the 1964 purchase by Gannett until the 1996-1998 consolidation period. In that, there was a fierce independence that led to exceptional reporting and photography on both sides of the Hudson River.

Gannett acquired nine of the newspapers in 1964 from the Macy family and added ''The Star'' in [[Peekskill, New York]] in 1985.<ref name="Gannett profile">{{cite web|url=http://www.gannett.com/about/map/ataglance/gsubur.htm|title=About Gannett: ''The Journal News''|author=Gannett Co., Inc.|access-date=2006-10-26}}</ref> These newspapers previously appeared on newsstands in the evening. In 1989, Gannett created a morning edition for Putnam County, Westchester, and the Bronx called ''The Sunrise'',<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/04/10/business/sunrise-paper-in-new-york-suburbs.html|title=Sunrise Paper in New York Suburbs|date=April 10, 1989|access-date=August 15, 2019|via=NYTimes.com}}</ref> but it folded after a year. Today, ''The Journal News'' appears in the morning like other New York dailies.

==History==
Newspapers that merged in 1998 to create ''The Journal News'':
*''Rockland Journal-News'' ([[West Nyack]])
*''The Citizen Register'' ([[Ossining (village), New York|Ossining]])
*''The Daily Argus'' ([[Mount Vernon, New York|Mount Vernon]])
*''The Daily Item'' ([[Port Chester, New York|Port Chester]])
*''The Daily News'' ([[Tarrytown, New York|Tarrytown]])
*''The Daily Times'' ([[Mamaroneck (village), New York|Mamaroneck]])
*''The Herald Statesman'' ([[Yonkers, New York|Yonkers]])
**''The Patent Trader'' ([[Mount Kisco, New York|Mount Kisco]]) (itself the product of a 1956 merger of Northern Westchester papers) was subsequently acquired by Gannett and folded in 2007.
*''The Reporter Dispatch'' ([[White Plains, New York|White Plains]])
*''The Standard-Star'' ([[New Rochelle, New York|New Rochelle]])
*''The Star'' ([[Peekskill, New York|Peekskill]])

''The Journal News'' successfully launched ''[[Putnam Magazine]]'' and ''Rockland Magazine'' in 2005, and ''[[Scarsdale Magazine]]'' (originally ''InTown Scarsdale'') in early 2006.

In 2005, ''The Journal News'' expanded its Custom Publishing division and began publishing a series of suburban lifestyle magazines about the Lower Hudson Valley region. The first of these publications was ''[[InTown]]'', which covered the Westchester market with hyper-local editions targeting different regions of the county:{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} In late 2006, these numerous editions were all consolidated into one county-wide publication, ''InTown Westchester'', which publishes 10 times a year.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}} 
*Bronxville/Tuckahoe/Eastchester 
*Larchmont/Mamaroneck
*Northern Westchester (Bedford, Chappaqua, Katonah, Mount Kisco)
*River Towns (Dobbs Ferry, Hastings, Irvington, Tarrytown)
*Rye/Harrison/Purchase
*Scarsdale
*White Plains

''The Journal News'' also publishes five ultra-local community weekly ''Express'' newspapers serving Northern Westchester, Putnam, Yorktown/Cortlandt, Sound Shore, and White Plains as well as the ''Review Press'', a weekly newspaper covering Bronxville, Eastchester, and Tuckahoe.

''The Journal News''' website, LoHud.com, features daily news updates, more than 40 blogs, as well as ''Varsity Insider'', an online source for varsity sports, featuring rosters, schedules, and statistic for high school teams throughout the Lower [[Hudson Valley]] region.<ref>{{cite web|website=lohud.com|url=http://www.lohud.com|publisher=The Journal News|title=LoHud}}</ref>

On March 7, 2010 ''The Journal News'' closed its press and outsourced printing.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}

On December 22, 2012, ''The Journal News'' published an interactive map showing the names, addresses and home locations of all pistol permit holders licensed in Westchester and Rockland Counties.<ref name=journalnews-burglar-target>{{cite news|title=Journal News gun permit map used by burglars to target White Plains home?|url=http://newyork.newsday.com/news/nation/journal-news-gun-permit-map-used-by-burglars-to-target-white-plains-home-1.4441678|newspaper=Newsday|date=2013-01-13|author=Timothy O'Connor|author2=Meghan E.

''[[Newsday]]'' has reported that police are investigating if the Journal News pistol permit map played a role in a burglary in White Plains, New York.  According to police, at least two burglars broke into a home on January 12, 2013 but were unsuccessful in an attempt to open a gun safe, which contained legally owned weapons.  Police are investigating what role, if any, the Journal News database played in the burglars' decision to target the home.<ref name="journalnews-burglar-target" />{{update after|2013|5|23}}<!-- what was the result of the police investigation?, if any? -->

On January 19, 2013, the newspaper removed the interactive map,<ref>http://www.lohud.com/article/20130119/NEWS05/301190057/The-Journal-News-pulls-gun-permit-data</ref> although the information it contained was subsequently leaked on the Internet.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.slashdot.org/story/13/01/20/0317245/|title=New York Pistol Permit Owner List Leaked - Slashdot|website=news.slashdot.org|access-date=August 15, 2019}}</ref>
