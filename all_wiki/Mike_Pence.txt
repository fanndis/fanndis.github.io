Pence withdrew his [[Indiana gubernatorial election, 2016|gubernatorial reelection campaign]] in July 2016 to become the running mate of Republican presidential nominee [[Donald Trump]], who went on to win the [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 presidential election]].

Pence and Trump lost their bid for re-election in the [[2020 United States presidential election]] to [[Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign|Joe Biden and Kamala Harris]], although [[Donald Trump 2020 presidential campaign|the Trump campaign]] has refused to concede and has filed unsubstantiated lawsuits in multiple states, alleging voter fraud, and has refused to cooperate with the [[Presidential transition of Joe Biden|transition]].<ref>{{Cite news|date=2020-11-05|title=Trump’s Election Lawsuits: Where the Court Fights Are Playing Out|language=en|work=Bloomberg.com|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-05/trump-election-lawsuits-filed-state-by-state|access-date=2020-11-14}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=CNN|first=Jeremy Herb|title=As Trump refuses to concede, his agencies awkwardly prepare what they can for a Biden transition|url=https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/13/politics/transition-agencies-wait-biden/index.html|access-date=2020-11-14|website=CNN}}</ref>

Pence opposed the [[Common Core State Standards Initiative]], calling for the repeal of the standards in his 2014 [[State of the State address]]. The Indiana General Assembly then passed a bill to repeal the standards, becoming the first state to do so.<ref name="KleinEdWeek"/><ref name="ElliottChalkbeat"/> In a televised interview appearance with [[Chris Matthews]], Pence advocated eroding the teaching of science in public schools by putting religious dogma on a par with established science, accepting "[[young earth creationism|creationist beliefs]]" as factual, and thus "[[teaching the controversy]]" over evolution and natural selection, and regarding the age of the earth, and letting children decide for themselves what to believe.<ref name=Boyle/>

===Abortion===

In March 2016, Pence, as Indiana governor, signed into law H.B. 1337, a bill that both banned certain [[abortion]] procedures and placed new [[Types of abortion restrictions in the United States|restrictions on abortion providers]].

====Death of Soleimani====

Pence defended Trump's decision in January 2020 to [[Assassination of Qasem Soleimani|assassinate the Iranian major general]] in the [[Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps]] (IRGC) [[Qasem Soleimani]], promoting conspiracy theories that supposedly linked the [[al-Queda]] attacks on the United States to Iran. In a series of [[Twitter#Tweets|tweets]], the vice president termed Soleimani "an evil man who was responsible for killing thousands of Americans". Pence insisted Soleimani had "assisted in the clandestine travel to Afghanistan of 10 of the 12 terrorists who carried out the [[September 11 terrorist attacks]]", which critics said was his confusing the number of 9/11 hijackers (actually 19) and insinuating (without evidence) that the general was involved. Many experts responded that Pence's claims were unsubstantiated.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jan/03/mike-pence-iran-911-suleimani |title=Mike Pence pushes 9/11 conspiracy theories to justify Suleimani killing |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |first=Maanvi |last=Singh |date=January 3, 2020 |access-date=January 4, 2020 }}</ref> Pence's spokeswoman [[Katie Waldman]] said that the dozen terrorists Pence referred to were those who had traveled through Afghanistan, ten of whom "were assisted by Soleimani".<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/pences-linkage-of-soleimani-to-911-hijackers-is-challenged/ar-BBYCqYW |title= Pence's linkage of Soleimani to 9/11 hijackers is challenged |agency=[[Agence France-Presse|AFP]] |date=January 4, 2020 |via=MSN |access-date=January 4, 2020 }}</ref>

In April 2020, Pence exempted himself from the [[Mayo Clinic]]'s policy of wearing a [[Face masks during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States|face mask]] in the hospital during a visit.

Ahead of his [[Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign|presidential campaign]] on February 28, 2019, Joe Biden referred to Pence as a "decent guy" in a speech in [[Omaha, Nebraska]], when making an anecdote about an audience falling silent after Pence mentioned Trump's name. Biden later faced criticism for his complimentary remarks due to Pence's alleged anti-LGBT positions, which Biden would later apologize for and clarify by saying, "I was making a point in a foreign policy context, that under normal circumstances a Vice President wouldn't be given a silent reaction on the world stage." Biden had previously referred to Pence as a "decent guy" in 2018, and Pence and Biden would exchange conversations via phone during Pence's initial transition into the vice presidency.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/28/politics/joe-biden-mike-pence-decent-guy-criticize-respond/index.html|title=Joe Biden responds to criticism after calling Pence a 'decent guy'|first=Arlette|last=Saenz|website=CNN|date=March 1, 2019|access-date=July 4, 2020}}</ref>

In June 2019, the Democratic former New York City Council president [[Andrew Stein]] opined that Trump could improve his re-election chances by replacing Pence as his running mate with former [[Governor of South Carolina|South Carolina governor]] and former [[United States Ambassador to the United Nations|United States ambassador to the United Nations]] [[Nikki Haley]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-haley-in-2020-11561316951 |title=Trump-Haley in 2020 |work=Wall Street Journal |author=Andrew Stein |date=June 23, 2019 |access-date=July 12, 2019 |url-access=subscription }}</ref> Despite that, Trump has said Pence will be his running mate, but declined to endorse Pence in 2019 should his running mate seek to succeed him, but said he would give it "very strong consideration".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2019/06/26/trump-says-mike-pence-will-be-running-mate/1570218001/ |title=Trump says Mike Pence is his 2020 running mate '100%,' dismisses idea of running with Nikki Haley |author=William Cummings |work=USA Today |date=June 26, 2019 |access-date=July 12, 2019}}</ref>

<blockquote>Freedom won today in the Supreme Court. Today's ruling in the Citizens United case takes us one step closer to the Founding Fathers' vision of free speech, a vision that is cherished by all Americans and one Congress has a responsibility to protect.

In the late 1990s, Pence supported the [[impeachment of President Bill Clinton]]. Arguing for the moral requirements of the office of the presidency, Pence wrote that an American president with "bad moral habits" can "incinerate the planet", thus nothing less than a president who represents "all of our highest hopes and ideals and values" could be accepted. Pence also brought up "staggering rates of illegitimacy and divorce", mandating that "America needs to be able to look to her First Family as role models."<ref name=moral1>{{cite web |last1=Kaczynski |first1=Andrew |title=Mike Pence's moral case for removing a president from office |url=https://edition.cnn.com/2018/08/06/politics/kfile-mike-pence-moral-columns/index.html |publisher=[[CNN]] |access-date=August 27, 2018}}</ref><ref name=moral2>{{cite magazine |last1=Holter |first1=Lauren |title=Mike Pence Quotes About Impeachment Reveal What He Really Thinks Of Presidents Having Affairs |url=https://www.bustle.com/p/mike-pence-quotes-about-impeachment-reveal-what-he-really-thinks-of-presidents-having-affairs-10026765 |magazine=[[Bustle (magazine)|Bustle]] |access-date=August 27, 2018}}</ref>
