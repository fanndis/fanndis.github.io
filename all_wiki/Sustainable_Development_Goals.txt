== Overview ==
=== Targets and indicators ===

[[File:A RES 71 313 E.pdf|thumb|Work of the Statistical Commission pertaining to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development containing the targets and indicators, July 2017 (UN resolution A/RES/71/313)]]
Each goal typically has 8-12 targets, and each target has between 1 and 4 indicators used to measure progress toward reaching the targets. The targets are either "outcome" targets (circumstances to be attained) or "means of implementation" targets.<ref name=":22">{{Cite journal|last1=Bartram|first1=Jamie|last2=Brocklehurst|first2=Clarissa|last3=Bradley|first3=David|last4=Muller|first4=Mike|last5=Evans|first5=Barbara|date=2018|title=Policy review of the means of implementation targets and indicators for the sustainable development goal for water and sanitation|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/s41545-018-0003-0|journal=NPJ Clean Water|language=en|volume=1|issue=1|pages=3|doi=10.1038/s41545-018-0003-0|issn=2059-7037|doi-access=free}} {{CC-notice|by4}}</ref> The latter targets were introduced late in the process of negotiating the SDGs to address the concern of some Member States about how the SDGs were to be achieved. Goal 17 is wholly about how the SDGs will be achieved.<ref name=":22" />   

The numbering system of targets is as follows: "Outcome targets" use numbers, whereas "means of implementation targets" use lower case letters.<ref name=":22" /> For example, SDG 6 has a total of 8 targets. The first six are outcome targets and are labeled Targets 6.1 to 6.6. The final two targets are "means of implementation targets" and are labeled as Targets 6.a and 6.b.

=== Reviews of indicators ===
As planned, the indicator framework was comprehensively reviewed at the 51st session of the [[United Nations Statistical Commission]] in 2020. It will be reviewed again in 2025.<ref name=":19">{{Cite web|title=IAEG-SDGs 2020 Comprehensive Review Proposals Submitted to the 51st session of the United Nations Statistical Commission for its consideration|url=https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/iaeg-sdgs/2020-comprev/UNSC-proposal/|access-date=1 September 2020|website=United Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Statistics Division}}</ref> At the 51st session of the Statistical Commission (held in [[New York City|New York]] City from 3 - 6 March 2020) a total of 36 changes to the global indicator framework were proposed for the Commission’s consideration. Some indicators were replaced, revised or deleted.<ref name=":19" /> Between 15 October 2018 and 17 April 2020, other changes were made to the indicators.<ref>{{Cite web|date=17 April 2020|title=SDG Indicator changes (15 October 2018 and onward) - current to 17 April 2020|url=https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/files/List_of_changes_since_15_Oct_2018.pdf|access-date=10 September 2020|website=United Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Statistics Division}}</ref>  

The [[United Nations Statistics Division]] (UNSD) website provides a current official indicator list which includes all updates until the 51st session Statistical Commission in March 2020.<ref name=":0" />

The indicators were classified into three tiers based on their level of methodological development and the availability of data at the global level.<ref name=":20">{{Cite web|title=IAEG-SDGs - Tier Classification for Global SDG Indicators|url=https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/iaeg-sdgs/tier-classification/|access-date=10 September 2020|website=United Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Statistics Division}}</ref> Tier 1 and Tier 2 are indicators that are conceptually clear, have an internationally established methodology, and data are regularly produced by at least some countries. Tier 3 indicators had no internationally established methodology or standards. The global indicator framework was adjusted so that Tier 3 indicators were either abandoned, replaced or refined.<ref name=":20" />  As of 17 July 2020, there were 231 unique indicators. <ref name=":20" />

=== The 17 individual goals ===
{{Further|List of Sustainable Development Goal targets and indicators}}

==== Goal 1: No poverty ====
{{Main|Sustainable Development Goal 1}}
[[Sustainable Development Goal 1|SDG 1]] is to: "End poverty in all its forms everywhere". Achieving SDG 1 would end [[extreme poverty]] globally by 2030. The goal has a total of seven targets: five to be reached by 2030 and two that have no specified date. The five outcome-related targets are: the eradication of [[extreme poverty]]; reduction of all [[poverty]] by half; implementation of social protection systems; ensuring equal rights to ownership, basic services, technology, and economic resources; and the building of resilience to environmental, economic and social [[Disaster|disasters]]. The two targets related to means of achieving SDG 1 call for mobilization of resources to end poverty; and the establishment of poverty eradication policy frameworks at all levels.<ref name=":17" /> There are 13 indicators to measure progress on the targets.

==== Goal 2: Zero hunger ====
{{Main|Sustainable Development Goal 2}}

[[File:Tasty Food Abundance in Healthy Europe.png|Sufficient and healthy foods should be made available to everyone|thumb|left]]

[[Sustainable Development Goal 2|SDG 2]] is to: "End [[hunger]], achieve [[food security]] and improved nutrition, and promote [[sustainable agriculture]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sustainable-development-goals/goal-2-zero-hunger.html|title=Goal 2: Zero hunger|website=UNDP|access-date=13 April 2017}}</ref> SDG 2 has eight targets.<ref name=":17" /> The five "outcome targets" are: ending hunger and improving access to food; ending all forms of [[malnutrition]]; [[agricultural productivity]]; sustainable food production systems and resilient agricultural practices; and genetic diversity of seeds, cultivated plants and farmed and domesticated animals; investments, research and technology. The three means for achieving SDG 2 include: addressing [[Trade restriction|trade restrictions]] and distortions in world agricultural markets and food [[Commodity market|commodity markets]] and their derivatives. SDG 2 has 14 indicators to measure progress. 

Globally, 1 in 9 people are undernourished, the vast majority of whom live in developing countries. Under nutrition causes wasting or severe wasting of 52 million children worldwide.<ref name="SDGChildren2018">{{cite web|url=https://data.unicef.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Progress_for_Every_Child_V4.pdf|title=Progress for Every Child in the SDG Era|website=UNICEF|access-date=2 April 2018}}</ref> It contributes to nearly half (45%) of deaths in children under five – 3.1 million children per year.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://data.unicef.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/130565-1.pdf|title=From Promise to Impact: Ending malnutrition by 2030|website=UNICEF|access-date=2 April 2018}}</ref>

The four "means to achieving" SDG 3 targets are:  implement the [[WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control]]; support research, development and universal access to affordable [[Vaccine|vaccines]] and medicines; increase health financing and support [[Health human resources|health workforce]] in [[developing countries]]; and improve early warning systems for global health risks.<ref name=":33">Ritchie, Roser, Mispy, Ortiz-Ospina (2018) "[https://sdg-tracker.org/good-health Measuring progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals]." (SDG 3) ''SDG-Tracker.org, website''</ref> SDG 3 has 21 indicators to measure progress toward targets.

Significant strides have been made in increasing life expectancy and reducing some of the common causes of [[Child mortality|child]] and [[Maternal death|maternal mortality]]. Between 2000 and 2016, the worldwide under-five mortality rate decreased by 47 percent (from 78 deaths per 1,000 live births to 41 deaths per 1,000 live births).<ref name="SDGChildren2018" /> Still, the number of children dying under age five is very high: 5.6 million in 2016.<ref name="SDGChildren2018" />

The Joint Monitoring Programme of [[World Health Organization|WHO]] and [[UNICEF]] ([[Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation|JMP]]) reported in 2017 that 4.5 billion people currently do not have [[Improved sanitation|safely managed sanitation]].<ref name="JMP2017">WHO and UNICEF (2017) [https://washdata.org/reports Progress on Drinking Water, Sanitation and Hygiene: 2017 Update and SDG Baselines]. Geneva: World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), 2017</ref> Also in 2017, only 71 per cent of the global population used safely managed drinking water, and 2.2 billion persons were still without safely managed drinking water. With regards to [[Water scarcity|water stress]]: "In 2017, [[Asia|Central and Southern Asia]] and [[North Africa|Northern Africa]] registered very high water stress – defined as the ratio of fresh water withdrawn to total renewable freshwater resources – of more than 70 per cent".<ref name=":522" /> [[Official development assistance]] (ODA) disbursements to the water sector increased to $9 billion in 2018.<ref name=":522" />  

==== Goal 7: Affordable and clean energy ====
{{Main|Sustainable Development Goal 7}}
[[Sustainable Development Goal 7|SDG 7]] is to: "Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all".<ref name=":9">{{cite web|url=http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sustainable-development-goals/goal-7-affordable-and-clean-energy.html|title=Goal 7: Affordable and clean energy|website=UNDP|access-date=28 September 2015}}</ref> SDG 7 has five "outcome targets": Universal access to modern energy; increase global percentage of [[renewable energy]]; double the improvement in energy efficiency; promote access to research, technology and investments in [[Sustainable energy|clean energy]]; and expand and upgrade [[Energy system|energy services]] for developing countries. In other words, these targets include access to affordable and reliable energy while increasing the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix. This would involve improving energy efficiency and enhancing international cooperation to facilitate more open access to clean energy technology and more investment in clean energy infrastructure. Plans call for particular attention to infrastructure support for the [[Least Developed Countries|least developed countries]], [[Small Island Developing States|small islands]] and land-locked [[Developing country|developing countries]].<ref name=":9" />

Progress in expanding access to [[electricity]] has been made in several countries, notably [[India]], [[Bangladesh]], and [[Kenya]].<ref name="Energyreport2019">IEA, IRENA, UNSD, WB, WHO (2019), [https://trackingsdg7.esmap.org/data/files/download-documents/2019-Tracking%20SDG7-Full%20Report.pdf Tracking SDG 7: The Energy Progress Report 2019], Washington DC (on [https://trackingsdg7.esmap.org/ Tracking SDG 7 website])</ref> The global population without access to electricity decreased to about 840 million in 2017 from 1.2 billion in 2010 ([[sub-Saharan Africa]] remains the region with the largest access deficit).<ref name="Energyreport2019" /> [[Renewable energy]] accounted for 17.5% of global total energy consumption in 2016.<ref name="Energyreport2019" /> Of the three end uses of [[Renewable energy|renewables]] ([[electricity]], [[heat]], and [[transport]]) the use of renewables grew fastest with respect to electricity. Between 2018 and 2030, the annual average investment will need to reach approximately $55 billion to expand energy access, about $700 billion to increase renewable energy and $600 billion to improve energy efficiency.<ref name="Energyreport2019" />[[File:Solar panels on house roof.jpg|thumb|Solar panels on house roof]]

==== Goal 8: Decent work and economic growth ====
{{Main|Sustainable Development Goal 8}}
[[Sustainable Development Goal 8|SDG 8]] is to: "Promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all".<ref name=":6">{{cite web|url=http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sustainable-development-goals/goal-8-decent-work-and-economic-growth.html|title=Goal 8: Decent work and economic growth|website=UNDP|access-date=12 March 2018}}</ref> For the least developed countries, the economic target is to attain at least a 7 percent annual growth in [[Gross domestic product|Gross Domestic Product]] (GDP). Achieving higher productivity will require diversification and upgraded technology along with innovation, entrepreneurship, and the growth of small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Some targets are for 2030; others are for 2020. The target for 2020 is to reduce youth unemployment and operationalize a global strategy for youth employment. Implementing the Global Jobs Pact of the [[International Labour Organization]] is also mentioned.

Strengthening domestic financial institutions and increasing Aid for Trade support for developing countries is considered essential to economic development. The Enhanced Integrated Framework for Trade-Related Technical Assistance to [[Least developed countries|Least Developed Countries]] is mentioned as a method for achieving sustainable economic development.<ref name=":6"/>

==== Goal 9: Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure ====
{{Main|Sustainable Development Goal 9}}
[[Sustainable Development Goal 9|SDG 9]] is to: "Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization, and foster innovation".<ref>{{cite web|title=Goal 9: Industry, innovation, infrastructure|url=http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sustainable-development-goals/goal-9-industry-innovation-and-infrastructure.html|website=UNDP|access-date=12 March 2018}}</ref>
This goal includes striving for [[resilience (engineering and construction)]] and [[urban resilience]]. Manufacturing is a major source of employment. In 2016, the least developed countries had less "manufacturing value added per capita." The figure for [[Europe]] and [[North America]] was US$4,621, compared to about $100 in the least developed countries.<ref name=":8">{{Cite web|url=https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdg9|title=Progress of Goal 9 in 2017|date=16 November 2017|website=Sustainable Development Knowledge Platform|access-date=16 November 2017}}</ref> The manufacturing of high-tech products contributes 80 percent to total manufacturing output in industrialized economies but barely 10 percent in the least developed countries.

The last of the seven targets is "Universal Access to Information and Communications Technology." Mobile-cellular signal coverage is the target's indicator and has improved a great deal. In previously "unconnected" areas of the globe, 85 percent of people now live in covered areas. Planet-wide, 95 percent of the population is covered.<ref name=":8"/>

==== Goal 10: Reducing inequalities ====
{{Main|Sustainable Development Goal 10}}
[[Sustainable Development Goal 10|SDG 10]] is to: "Reduce [[Economic inequality|income inequality]] within and among countries".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sustainable-development-goals/goal-10-reduced-inequalities.html|title=Goal 10: Reduced inequalities|website=UNDP|access-date=12 March 2018}}</ref> Progress toward SDG 10 targets calls for reducing income inequalities; promoting universal social, economic and political inclusion; ensuring equal opportunities and end discrimination; adopting fiscal and social policies that promote equality;  improving regulation of global [[Financial market|financial markets]] and institutions; enhancing representation of developing countries in financial institutions; and responsible and well-managed migration policies.  The targets relating to means of achieving goals call for special and differential treatment for developing countries; encourage development assistance and investment in least developed countries; and call for reduced transaction costs for migrant remittances.<ref name=":17" />

Target 10.1 is to "sustain income growth of the bottom 40 per cent of the population at a rate higher than the national average". This goal, known as 'shared prosperity', is complementing [[Sustainable Development Goal 1|SDG 1]], the eradication of extreme poverty, and it is relevant for all countries in the world.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldbank.org/en/about/what-we-do|title=What We Do|website=World Bank|language=en|access-date=2019-03-10}}</ref>

=== Monitoring ===

The UN [[High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development|High-Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development]] (HLPF) is the annual space for global monitoring of the SDGs, under the auspices of the [[United Nations Economic and Social Council|United Nations economic and Social Council]]. In July 2020 the meeting took place online for the first time due to the [[COVID-19 pandemic]]. The theme was "Accelerated action and transformative pathways: realizing the decade of action and delivery for sustainable development" and a ministerial declaration was adopted.<ref name=":522" />

High-level progress reports for all the SDGs are published in the form of reports by the [[Secretary-General of the United Nations|United Nations Secretary General]]. The most recent one is from April 2020.<ref name=":522" />  

The online publication SDG-Tracker was launched in June 2018 and presents data across all available indicators.<ref name="SDGtracker" /> It relies on the [[Our World In Data|Our World in Data]] database and is also based at the [[University of Oxford]].<ref name=":14">Ritchie, Roser, Mispy, Ortiz-Ospina.

The website "allows people around the world to hold their governments accountable to achieving the agreed goals".<ref name=":14" /> The SDG-Tracker highlights that the world is currently (early 2019) very far away from achieving the goals.

The Global "SDG Index and Dashboards Report" is the first publication to track countries' performance on all 17 Sustainable Development Goals.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sdgindex.org/|title=SDG Index|last1=SDSN|last2=Bertelsmann Stiftung|website=SDG Index and Dashboards Report|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-24}}</ref> The annual publication, co-produced by Bertelsmann Stiftung and SDSN, includes a ranking and dashboards that show key challenges for each country in terms of implementing the SDGs. The publication features trend analysis to show how countries performing on key SDG metrics have changed over recent years in addition to an analysis of government efforts to implement the SDGs.

== Cross-cutting issues ==
[[File:Sustainable Development Goals (Lima, Peru) 1.jpg|thumb|240px|Young people holding SDG banners in Lima, Peru]]To achieve sustainable development, three sectors need to come together. The economic, socio-political, and environmental  sectors are all critically important and interdependent.<ref name=":4">{{cite web|url=http://jiid.in/2016/08/sustainable-development-goals-2016-2030-easier-stated-achieved/|title=Sustainable Development Goals 2016-2030: Easier Stated Than Achieved – JIID|date=2016-08-21|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-09-17}}</ref> Progress will require [[multidisciplinary]] and trans-disciplinary research across all three sectors. This proves difficult when major governments fail to support it.<ref name=":4" />

According to the [[United Nations|UN]], the target is to reach the community farthest behind. Commitments should be transformed into effective actions requiring a correct perception of target populations. However, numerical and non-numerical data or information must address all vulnerable groups such as children, elderly folks, [[Disability|persons with disabilities]], [[refugee]]s, [[indigenous peoples]], [[Migrant worker|migrants]], and [[Internally displaced person|internally-displaced persons]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/report/2016/leaving-no-one-behind|title=Leaving no one behind — SDG Indicators|website=unstats.un.org|access-date=2019-02-04}}</ref>

=== Gender equality ===
The widespread consensus is that progress on all of the SDGs will be stalled if women's empowerment and gender equality are not prioritized, and treated holistically. The SDGs look to policy makers as well as private sector executives and board members to work toward gender equality.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Firzli |first1=Nicolas |title=6th World Pensions Forum held at the Queen's House: ESG and Asset Ownership |url=https://amnt.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/6th-World-Pensions-Forum2017.pdf |access-date=28 April 2017 |work= Revue Analyse Financière |publisher=Revue Analyse Financière |date=5 April 2017}}</ref><ref name="auto2">{{cite news |last1=Firzli |first1=Nicolas |title=Greening, Governance and Growth in the Age of Popular Empowerment |url=http://www.pensions-expert.com/Special-Features/The-Cut/Greening-governance-and-growth-in-the-age-of-popular-empowerment |access-date=27 April 2018 |work=FT Pensions Experts |publisher=Financial Times |date=3 April 2018}}</ref> Statements from diverse sources, such as the [[OECD|Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development]] (OECD), [[UN Women]] and the [[World Pensions & Investments Forum|World Pensions Forum]], have noted that investments in women and girls have positive impacts on economies.

=== Education  ===
{{Main|Education for sustainable development}}

[[Education for sustainable development]] (ESD) is explicitly recognized in the SDGs as part of Target 4.7 of the SDG on education. [[UNESCO]] promotes the [[Global citizenship education|Global Citizenship Education]] (GCED) as a complementary approach.<ref>[http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002329/232993e.pdf Global Citizenship Education: Topics and learning objectives], UNESCO, 2015.</ref> At the same time, it is important to emphasize ESD's importance for all the other 16 SDGs. With its overall aim to develop cross-cutting sustainability competencies in learners, ESD is an essential contribution to all efforts to achieve the SDGs. This would enable individuals to contribute to sustainable development by promoting societal, economic and political change as well as by transforming their own behavior.<ref>{{Cite book |url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002474/247444e.pdf |title=Education for Sustainable Development Goals: Learning Objectives |last=UNESCO |publisher=Paris, UNESCO |year=2017 |isbn=978-92-3-100209-0 |pages=7}}</ref>

=== Culture ===
Culture is explicitly referenced in [[SDG 11]] Target 4 ("Strengthen efforts to protect and safeguard the world’s cultural and natural heritage"). However, culture is seen as a cross-cutting theme because it impacts several SDGs.<ref name=":23" /> For example, culture plays a role in SDGs related to:<ref name=":23" />{{rp|2}} 

* environment and resilience (Targets 11.4 Cultural & natural heritage, 11.7 Inclusive public spaces, 12.b Sustainable tourism management,  16.4 Recovery of stolen assets),
* prosperity and livelihoods (Targets 8.3 Jobs, entrepreneurship & innovation; 8.9 Policies for sustainable tourism),
* knowledge and skills, 
* inclusion and participation (Targets 11.7 Inclusive public spaces, 16.7 Participatory decision-making).

Implementation of the SDGs started worldwide in 2016. This process can also be called "Localizing the SDGs". Individual people, universities, governments, institutions and organizations of all kinds work are working separately but one or more goals at the same time.<ref name="globalcitizen.org">{{Cite web |url=https://www.globalcitizen.org/en/global-goals/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=28 June 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170702204256/https://www.globalcitizen.org/en/global-goals/ |archive-date=2 July 2017 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Individual governments must translate the goals into national legislation, develop a plan of action, and establish their own budget. However, at the same time, they must be open to and actively searching for partners. Coordination at the international level is crucial, making partnerships valuable.

The co-chairs of the SDG negotiations each produced a book to help people to understand the Sustainable Development Goals and how they evolved. The books are: "Negotiating the Sustainable Development Goals: A transformational agenda for an insecure world" by Ambassador David Donoghue, [[Felix Dodds]] and Jimena Leiva and "Transforming Multilateral Diplomacy: The Inside Story of the Sustainable Development Goals" by [[Macharia Kamau]], David O'Connor and Pamela Chasek.

The [[Rockefeller Foundation]] asserts that "The key to financing and achieving the SDGs lies in mobilizing a greater share of the $200+ trillion in annual private capital investment flows toward development efforts, and philanthropy has a critical role to play in catalyzing this shift."<ref>{{Cite web|last=Madsbjerg|first=Saadia|date=19 September 2017|title=A New Role for Foundations in Financing the Global Goals|url=https://www.rockefellerfoundation.org/blog/new-role-foundations-financing-global-goals/|access-date=4 June 2018}}</ref> Large-scale funders participating in a Rockefeller Foundation-hosted design thinking workshop concluded that "while there is a moral imperative to achieve the SDGs, failure is inevitable if there aren't drastic changes to how we go about financing large scale change".<ref name=":29">{{Cite web|last=Burgess|first=Cameron|date=March 2018|title=From Billions to Trillions: Mobilising the Missing Trillions to Solve the Sustainable Development Goals|url=https://sphaera.world/billions-to-trillions/|access-date=4 June 2018|website=sphaera.world}}</ref>

In 2017 the [[United Nations|UN]] launched the Inter-agency Task Force on Financing for Development ([[United Nations|UN]] IATF on FfD) that invited to a public dialogue.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://developmentfinance.un.org/about-iatf|title=About the IATF {{!}} United Nations|website=developmentfinance.un.org|access-date=2019-12-08}}</ref> The top-5 sources of financing for development were estimated in 2018 to be: Real new [[Government debt|sovereign debt]] OECD countries, [[Military budget|military expenditures]], official increase sovereign debt OECD countries, [[Remittance|remittances]] from expats to developing countries, official development assistance (ODA).<ref name=":12" />

=== SDG-driven investment ===
[[Stewardship|Capital stewardship]] is expected to play a crucial part in the progressive advancement of the SDG agenda: 
: "No longer [[absentee landlord]]s', [[pension fund]] trustees have started to exercise more forcefully their [[governance]] prerogatives across the boardrooms of Britain, Benelux and America: coming together through the establishment of engaged pressure groups [...] to shift the [whole economic] system towards sustainable investment"<ref name="Revue Analyse Financiere">{{cite news|last1=Firzli|first1=M.

In 2017, 2018 and early 2019, the [[World Pensions & Investments Forum|World Pensions Council (WPC)]] held a series of ESG-focused discussions with pension board members (trustees) and senior investment executives from across [[G20]] nations in [[Toronto]], [[London]] (with the UK Association of Member-Nominated Trustees, AMNT),  [[Paris]] and [[New York City|New York]] – notably on the sidelines of the 73rd session of the [[United Nations General Assembly]]. Many pension investment executives and board members confirmed they were in the process of adopting or developing SDG-informed investment processes, with more ambitious investment governance requirements – notably when it comes to Climate Action, Gender Equity and Social Fairness: “they straddle key Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), including, of course, Gender Equality (SDG 5) and Reduced Inequality (SDG 10) […] Many pension trustees are now playing for keeps”.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Firzli|first1=Nicolas|date=7 December 2018|title=An Examination of Pensions Trends.

The notion of "SDG Driven Investment" gained further ground amongst institutional investors in the second semester of 2019, notably at the [[World Pensions & Investments Forum|WPC-led]] [[G7]] Pensions Roundtable held in [[Biarritz]], 26 August 2019,<ref>{{cite news|last1=Firzli|first1=Nicolas|date=10 February 2020|title=G7 Pensions Roundtable : Les ODD ('SDGs') Désormais Incontournables|work=Cahiers du Centre des Professions Financières|publisher=CPF|ssrn=3545217}}</ref> and the [[Business Roundtable]] held in Washington, DC, on 19 August 2019.<ref>{{cite news|last1=McGregor|first1=Jena|date=20 August 2019|title=Group of top CEOs says maximizing shareholder profits no longer can be the primary goal of corporations|work=Washington Post|publisher=WP|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/08/19/lobbying-group-powerful-ceos-is-rethinking-how-it-defines-corporations-purpose|access-date=17 March 2020}}</ref>

UN agencies which are part of the [[United Nations Development Group]] decided to support an independent campaign to communicate the new SDGs to a wider audience. This campaign, "Project Everyone," had the support of corporate institutions and other international organizations.<ref name=":2">{{cite web|url=http://www.project-everyone.org/|title=Project Everyone|website=Project-everyone.org|access-date=11 October 2016}}</ref>

An early concern was that 17 goals would be too much for people to grasp and that therefore the SDGs would fail to get a wider recognition.{{When|date=November 2018}} Without wider recognition the necessary momentum to achieve them by 2030 would not be achieved. Concerned with this, British film-maker [[Richard Curtis]] started the organization in 2015 called Project Everyone with the aim to bring the goals to everyone on the planet.<ref>https://www.project-everyone.org/ Project Everyone</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://sdg.iisd.org/commentary/guest-articles/making-the-sdgs-famous-and-popular/|title=Guest Article: Making the SDGs Famous and Popular - SDG Knowledge Hub - IISD|first=IISD's SDG Knowledge|last=Hub}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/09382406|title=PROJECT EVERYONE - Overview (free company information from Companies House)|website=beta.companieshouse.gov.uk}}</ref> Curtis approached Swedish designer Jakob Trollbäck who rebranded them as The Global Goals and created the 17 iconic visuals with clear short names as well as a logotype for the whole initiative.

==== Film festivals ====
The annual "Le Temps Presse" festival in [[Paris]] utilizes cinema to sensitize the public, especially young people, to the Sustainable Development Goals. The origin of the festival was in 2010 when eight directors produced a film titled "8," which included eight short films, each featuring one of the [[Millennium Development Goals]]. After 2.5 million viewers saw "8" on YouTube, the festival was created. It now showcases young directors whose work promotes social, environmental and human commitment.

In 1972, governments met in [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]] for the [[United Nations Conference on the Human Environment]], to consider the rights of the family to a healthy and productive environment.<ref>{{cite web |title=The History of Sustainable Development in the United Nations |url=http://www.uncsd2012.org/history.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120618171731/http://www.uncsd2012.org/history.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=18 June 2012 |website=Rio+20 UN Conference on Sustainable Development |publisher=UN |access-date=27 October 2018 |date=20-22 June 2012}}</ref> In 1983, the [[United Nations]] created the [[Brundtland Commission|World Commission on Environment and Development]] (later known as the Brundtland Commission), which defined [[sustainable development]] as "meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.un-documents.net/ocf-02.htm|title=Our Common Future, Chapter 2: Towards Sustainable Development - A/42/427 Annex, Chapter 2 - UN Documents: Gathering a body of global agreements|last=Development|first=World Commission on Environment and|website=www.un-documents.net|access-date=2017-11-17}}</ref> In 1992, the first [[United Nations Conference on Environment and Development]] (UNCED) or Earth Summit was held in [[Rio de Janeiro]], where the first agenda for Environment and Development, also known as [[Agenda 21]], was developed and adopted.

In January 2013, the 30-member [[United Nations General Assembly|UN General Assembly]] Open Working Group on Sustainable Development Goals was established to identify specific goals for the SDGs. The Open Working Group (OWG) was tasked with preparing a proposal on the SDGs for consideration during the 68th session of the General Assembly, September 2013 – September 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2013/ga11339.doc.htm |title=New Open Working Group to Propose Sustainable Development Goals for Action by General Assembly's Sixty-eighth Session &#124; Meetings Coverage and Press Releases |website=Un.org |date=2013-01-22 |access-date=2016-10-18}}</ref> On 19 July 2014, the OWG forwarded a proposal for the SDGs to the Assembly.

The [[Post-2015 Development Agenda]] was a process from 2012 to 2015 led by the [[United Nations]] to define the future global development framework that would succeed the [[Millennium Development Goals]]. The SDGs were developed to succeed the [[Millennium Development Goals]] (MDGs) which ended in 2015. The gaps and shortcomings of MDG Goal 8 (To develop a global partnership for development) led to identifying a problematic "donor-recipient" relationship.<ref name="post-2015">{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/en/development/desa/policy/untaskteam_undf/report2.shtml|title=Report of the UN System Task Team on the Post-2015 UN Development Agenda|author=UN Task Team on the Post 2015 Agenda|date=March 2013|publisher=United Nations|page=1|access-date=17 July 2018}}</ref> Instead, the new SDGs favor collective action by all countries.<ref name="post-2015"/>

[[File:N1529189.pdf|thumb|Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (UN Resolution A/RES/70/1), containing the goals (October 2015)]]
Negotiations on the [[Post-2015 Development Agenda]] began in January 2015 and ended in August 2015. The negotiations ran in parallel to [[United Nations]] negotiations on financing for development, which determined the financial means of implementing the [[Post-2015 Development Agenda]]; those negotiations resulted in adoption of the [[Addis Ababa Action Agenda]] in July 2015. A final document was adopted at the UN Sustainable Development Summit in September 2015 in [[New York City|New York]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/presscenter/pressreleases/2015/09/24/undp-welcomes-adoption-of-sustainable-development-goals-by-world-leaders.html|title=World leaders adopt Sustainable Development Goals|website=United Nations Development Programme|access-date=25 September 2015}}</ref>

On 25 September 2015, the 193 countries of the UN General Assembly adopted the 2030 Development Agenda titled "Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development".<ref name=":3">{{cite web|title=Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development|url=https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/post2015/transformingourworld|access-date=23 August 2015|website=United Nations – Sustainable Development knowledge platform}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/26/world/breakdown-of-un-sustainable-development-goals.html?_r=0|title=Breakdown of U.N.

Paragraph 59 outlines the 17 Sustainable Development Goals and the associated 169 targets and 232 indicators.

==Reception==
The SDGs have been criticized for setting contradictory goals and for trying to do everything first, instead of focusing on the most urgent or fundamental priorities. The SDGs were an outcome from a UN conference that was not criticized by any major [[non-governmental organization]] (NGO). Instead, the SDGs received broad support from many NGOs.<ref>Sustainable Brands (2016) [http://www.sustainablesids.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NGOs-leading-SDGs-Sustainable-Brands.pdf NGOs leading the way on sustainable development goals]</ref>

A commentary in ''[[The Economist]]'' in 2015 said that the SDGs are "a mess" compared to the eight [[Millennium Development Goals|MDGs]] used previously.<ref name=":5" /> Others have pointed out that the SDGs mark a shift from the [[Millennium Development Goals]] (MDGs) and emphasise the interconnected environmental, social and economic aspects of development, by putting sustainability at their centre.<ref name=":18">{{Cite journal|last1=Schleicher|first1=Judith|last2=Schaafsma|first2=Marije|last3=Vira|first3=Bhaskar|date=2018|title=Will the Sustainable Development Goals address the links between poverty and the natural environment?|journal=Current Opinion in Environmental Sustainability|language=en|volume=34|pages=43–47|doi=10.1016/j.cosust.2018.09.004|doi-access=free}}</ref>

The SDGs may simply maintain the ''status quo'' and fall short of delivering on the ambitious development agenda. The current status quo has been described as "separating human wellbeing and environmental sustainability, failing to change governance and to pay attention to trade-offs, root causes of poverty and environmental degradation, and social justice issues".<ref name=":18" />

Regarding the targets of the SDGs, there is generally weak evidence linking the "means of implementation" to outcomes.<ref name=":22" /> The targets about "means of implementation" (those denoted with a letter, for example, Target 6.a) are imperfectly conceptualized and inconsistently formulated, and tracking their largely qualitative indicators will be difficult.<ref name=":22" />

=== Competing and too many goals ===

{{see also|Food vs. fuel}}
Some of the goals compete with each other. For example, seeking high levels of quantitative [[GDP growth]] can make it difficult to attain [[ecological]], inequality reduction, and sustainability objectives. Similarly, increasing employment and wages can work against reducing the [[cost of living]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=Ramanauskas|first=Ben|date=2018-10-29|title=What the Minimum Wage Does to Food Prices (and Job Hiring) {{!}} Ben Ramanauskas|url=https://fee.org/articles/what-the-minimum-wage-does-to-food-prices-and-job-hiring/|access-date=2020-09-23|website=fee.org|language=en}}</ref>

A commentary in ''[[The Economist]]'' in 2015 argued that 169 targets for the SDGs is too many, describing them as "sprawling, misconceived" and "a mess".<ref name=":5">{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21647286-proposed-sustainable-development-goals-would-be-worse-useless-169-commandments|title=The 169 commandments|newspaper=The Economist|access-date=2016-02-19|issn=0013-0613}}</ref> The goals are said to ignore local context. All other 16 goals might be contingent on achieving SDG 1, ending poverty, which should have been at the top of a very short list of goals.

On the other hand, nearly all stakeholders engaged in negotiations to develop the SDGs agreed that the high number of 17 goals was justified because the agenda they address is all-encompassing.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}

=== Weak on environmental sustainability ===

Continued global economic growth of 3 percent (Goal 8) may not be reconcilable with ecological sustainability goals, because the required rate of absolute global [[eco-economic decoupling]] is far higher than any country has achieved in the past.<ref name=":15">{{cite journal|last=Hickel|first=Jason|date=2019-04-15|title=The contradiction of the sustainable development goals: Growth versus ecology on a finite planet|journal=Sustainable Development|publisher=Wiley|volume=27|issue=5|pages=873–884|doi=10.1002/sd.1947|issn=0968-0802}}</ref> Anthropologists have suggested that, instead of targeting aggregate GDP growth, the goals could target [[resource]] use per capita, with "substantial reductions in high‐income nations."<ref name=":15" />

Environmental constraints and [[planetary boundaries]] are underrepresented within the SDGs. For instance, the paper "Making the Sustainable Development Goals Consistent with Sustainability<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Wackernagel|first1=Mathis|last2=Hanscom|first2=Laurel|last3=Lin|first3=David|date=2017|title=Making the Sustainable Development Goals Consistent with Sustainability|journal=Frontiers in Energy Research|language=en|volume=5|doi=10.3389/fenrg.2017.00018|issn=2296-598X|doi-access=free}}</ref>" points out that the way the current SDGs are structured leads to a negative correlation between environmental sustainability and SDGs. This means, as the environmental sustainability side of the SDGs is underrepresented, the resource security for all, particularly for lower-income populations, is put at risk. This is not a criticism of the SDGs ''per se'', but a recognition that their environmental conditions are still weak.<ref name=":15" />

The SDGs have been criticized for their inability to protect biodiversity. They could unintentionally promote [[Environmental degradation|environmental destruction]] in the name of sustainable development.<ref>{{Cite web|last=The University of Queensland|date=6 July 2020|title=Latest U.N. sustainability goals pose more harm than good for environment, scientists warn|url=https://phys.org/news/2020-07-latest-sustainability-goals-pose-good.html|access-date=27 August 2020|website=phys.org}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Zeng|first1=Yiwen|last2=Maxwell|first2=Sean|last3=Runting|first3=Rebecca K.|last4=Venter|first4=Oscar|last5=Watson|first5=James E.

=== Importance of technology and connectivity ===
Several years after the launch of the SDGs, growing voices called for more emphasis on the need for technology and internet connectivity within the goals. In September 2020, the UN Broadband Commission for Sustainable Development called for digital connectivity to be established as a “foundational pillar” for achieving all the SDGs. In a document titled “Global Goal of Universal Connectivity Manifesto”, the Broadband Commission said: “As we define the ‘new normal’ for our post-COVID world, leaving no one behind means leaving no one offline.”<ref>{{Cite web|last=ITU|first=Broadband Commission|date=18-09-2020|title=Broadband Commission calls on world leaders to prioritize universal connectivity as fundamental to sustainable development & global recovery|url=https://www.itu.int/en/mediacentre/Pages/PR20-2020-broadband-commission.aspx|access-date=25-09-2020|website=itu.int}}</ref>

==== Australia ====
{{Main|Sustainable Development Goals and Australia}}
The [[Australia|Commonwealth of Australia]] was one of the 193 countries that adopted the 2030 Agenda in September 2015. Implementation of the agenda is led by the [[Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Australia)|Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT)]] and the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet (PM&C) with different federal government agencies responsible for each of the goals.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Cabinet|first=Prime Minister and|date=2018-02-20|title=2030 Sustainable Development Goals|url=https://www.pmc.gov.au/news-centre/office-women/2030-sustainable-development-goals|access-date=2020-09-14|website=www.pmc.gov.au|language=en}}</ref> Australia is not on-track to achieve the SDGs by 2030.<ref name=":24" /> Four modelled scenarios based on different development approaches found that the 'Sustainability Transition' scenario could deliver "rapid and balanced progress of 70% towards SDG targets by 2020, well ahead of the business-as-usual scenario (40%)".<ref name=":24">{{Cite journal|last1=Allen|first1=Cameron|last2=Metternicht|first2=Graciela|last3=Wiedmann|first3=Thomas|last4=Pedercini|first4=Matteo|date=11 November 2019|title=Greater gains for Australia by tackling all SDGs but the last steps will be the most challenging|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-019-0409-9|journal=Nature Sustainability|language=en|volume=2|issue=11|pages=1041–1050|doi=10.1038/s41893-019-0409-9|s2cid=207990746|issn=2398-9629}}</ref> In 2020, Australia's overall performance in the SDG Index is ranked 37th out of 166 countries (down from 18th out of 34 countries in 2015).<ref>{{Cite web|date=30 June 2020|title=Sustainable Development Report 2020|url=https://dashboards.sdgindex.org/profiles/aus|url-status=live|archive-url=https://dashboards.sdgindex.org/static/countries/profiles/Australia.pdf|archive-date=14 September 2020|access-date=2020-09-14|website=dashboards.sdgindex.org|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Kroll|first=Christian|date=September 2015|title=Sustainable Development Goals: Are the rich countries ready? page 6|url=https://www.bertelsmann-stiftung.de/fileadmin/files/BSt/Publikationen/GrauePublikationen/Studie_NW_Sustainable-Development-Goals_Are-the-rich-countries-ready_2015.pdf|website=BertelsmannStiftung}}</ref>

====Bhutan====

The Sustainable development process in [[Bhutan]] has a more meaningful purpose than economic growth alone. The nation's holistic goal is the pursuit of [[Gross National Happiness]] (GNH),<ref>{{Cite web|title=2015 GNH Survey Report|url=https://www.grossnationalhappiness.com/|access-date=4 November 2020|language=en-US}}</ref> a term coined in 1972 by the Fourth King of Bhutan, [[Jigme Singye Wangchuck]], which has the principal guiding philosophy for the long term journey as a nation. Therefore, the SDGs find a natural place within the framework of GNH sharing a common vision of prosperity, peace, and harmony where no one is left behind. Just as GNH is both an ideal to be pursued and a practical tool so too the SDGs inspire and guide sustainable action. Guided by the development paradigm of GNH, Bhutan is committed to achieving the goals of SDGs by 2030 since its implementation in September 2015. In line with Bhutan's commitment to the implementation of the SDGs and sustainable development, Bhutan has participated in the Voluntary National Review in the 2018 High-Level Political Forum.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Bhutan - Sustainable Development Knowledge Platform|url=https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/memberstates/bhutan|access-date=2020-11-04|website=United Nations}}</ref>  As the country has progressed in its 12th [[Five-Year Plans of Bhutan| five-year plan]] (2019–2023), the national goals have been aligned with the SDGs and every agency plays a vital role in its own ways to collectively achieving the committed goals of SDGs.
