==Biography==
Roberto Cavalli was born in [[Florence]], [[Tuscany]]. His grandfather, Giuseppe Rossi, was an artist and a member of the [[Macchiaioli]] Movement, whose work is exhibited in the [[Uffizi Gallery]].  Cavalli enrolled at the local Art Institute, concentrating in [[textile]] print. While still a student, he made a series of flower prints on knit that caught the attention of major Italian hosiery factories.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}

In the early 1970s, he invented and [[patent]]ed a printing procedure on [[leather]], and started creating patchworks of different materials. He debuted these techniques in Paris, immediately getting commissions from the likes of [[Hermès]] and [[Pierre Cardin]]. At age 32, he presented his first namesake collection at the Salon for Prêt-à-Porter in Paris. He brought it to the catwalks of the Sala Bianca of [[Palazzo Pitti]] in Florence, and later on those of Milano Collezioni, jeans made of printed denim, intarsia leathers, brocade, and wild prints. He then opened his first boutique in 1972 in Saint-Tropez.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}

In 1980, Roberto Cavalli married Eva Düringer, a former [[Miss Austria]] and first runner-up of the [[Miss Universe 1977]] pageant. In Milan in 1994, Cavalli presented the first sand-blasted jeans. By December of the same year, he had opened boutiques in [[Saint Barth]], in the French Caribbean, followed by others in [[Venice]] and [[Saint-Tropez]]. Besides the main line, which is sold in over fifty countries worldwide, Roberto Cavalli designs RC Menswear as well as the youth aimed [[diffusion line|line]] Just Cavalli, launched in 2000 <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vogue.co.uk/article/roberto-cavalli-biography|author=Caroline Leaper|title=Roberto Cavalli|publisher=[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]|date=April 22, 2008}}</ref> and comprising today men’s wear, women’s wear and accessories, eyewear, watches, jewelry, perfumes, underwear, and beachwear. There is also the Angels & Devils Children Collection, the Class line, two underwear collections, shoes, eyewear, watches and perfumes. In 2002, Cavalli opened his first café-store in Florence, revamping it with his signature [[animal prints]]. This was shortly followed by the opening in Milan of the Just Cavalli café at Torre Branca and another boutique on [[Via della Spiga]].

Roberto Cavalli was a judge at the Miss Universe 1977 pageant where his future wife (Eva Duringer) was a contestant, who represented Austria and won second place. The woman that won was the first Black Miss Universe (Miss Trinidad and Tobago: [[Janelle Commissiong]]). In July 2011, his company collection was presented at the catwalk of [[The Brandery]] fashion show in [[Barcelona]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thebrandery.com/portal/appmanager/efiraSalones/S094011?_nfpb=true&_pageLabel=P75201021481310034214819&profileLocale=en |accessdate=July 14, 2011 |title=The Brandery Catwalk|url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110903012646/http://www.thebrandery.com/portal/appmanager/efiraSalones/S094011?_nfpb=true&_pageLabel=P75201021481310034214819&profileLocale=en |archivedate=September 3, 2011 }}</ref>

==Brand==
As of January 2014, Cavalii returned to the role of men's creative director from his son, Daniele Cavalli, starting with the 2014 fall collection, appointing [[Martyn Bal]] as his righthand man<ref name="Daniele Cavalli Exits Roberto Cavalli">{{cite web | url=http://www.wwd.com/fashion-news/fashion-scoops/design-change-7399470?src=nl/mornReport/20140129 | title=Daniele Cavalli Exits Roberto Cavalli | publisher=WWD | date=29 January 2014 | accessdate=29 January 2014 | author=Turra, Alessandra}}</ref> Also, on 24 January 2014, Gianluca Brozzetti (CEO) and Carlo Di Biagio (COO) announced they were leaving the fashion brand.<ref name="Daniele Cavalli Exits Roberto Cavalli"/>

In May 2014, Cavalli approached Investcorp, an investment firm in the [[Persian Gulf]], as a potential buyer of a stake in his fashion brand.<ref>{{cite news|title= Roberto Cavalli approaches Investcorp for possible investment|work= Reuters|date=27 May 2014|url= https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/05/27/us-cavalli-investcorp-idUSKBN0E70CJ20140527|accessdate=27 May 2014}}</ref>

On March 29, 2019, Roberto Cavalli closed its US stores and is preparing to liquidate its North American operations.  On the same day the brand announced plans to seek an agreement with creditors in a bid to keep the business afloat while it continues to search for an investor, security guards entered the company's US stores—including approximately seven full-line stores and a handful of off-price outlets—and instructed employees to leave, according to two salespeople. Employees were told by senior corporate management that the fashion house planned to close its brick-and-mortar stores in the US as the business restructures.

As a result of these changes, several corporate executives, including US CEO Salvatore Tramuto, have resigned. The US corporate team was notified on March 22 that the North American operation, which operates as Art Fashion Corp., was insolvent and that it would need to close all stores, according to a senior-level executive with direct knowledge of the information.

A Cavalli spokesman has confirmed that Art Fashion Corp. will file for Chapter 7 bankruptcy—also known as liquidation bankruptcy—in the US this week. E-commerce operations were temporarily shut down until logistics can be re-routed through the European operation, he said. The company's 93 US employees were terminated on Friday, though they will receive a final paycheck this week, the spokesman said.

Many leading models have worked for the brand: [[Jessica Stam]], [[Eva Riccobono]], [[Laetitia Casta]], [[Natasha Poly]], [[Mariacarla Boscono]], [[Karen Elson]], [[Karolina Kurkova]] and Ivan Olita.<ref>{{cite web|title=Singers designer, Armani as gettonato|url=http://www.corriere.it/spettacoli/speciali/2009/sanremo/notizie/sanremo_moda_bulbarelli_671a9136-fcd5-11dd-b299-00144f02aabc.shtml|publisher=Corriere della Sera|accessdate=17 February 2009}}</ref> amongst others.{{citation needed|reason=See talk page|date=December 2015}}

In 2019, [[DAMAC Properties]]'s [[Hussain Sajwani]] completed the acquisition of Italian fashion group Roberto Cavalli. <ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.constructionweekonline.com/business/260992-damac-chairmans-investment-firm-acquires-italys-roberto-cavalli |title=Damac chairman's investment firm acquires Italy's Roberto Cavalli |last=Warrier |first=Ranju |date=1 December 2019 |website= www.constructionweekonline.com|access-date=2020-01-17}}</ref>

==Criticism==
Cavalli was sharply criticized in 2004 by the [[Hindu]] community for marketing a line of feminine underwear (designed for [[Harrods]]) which featured the images of Hindu goddesses.   The line was eventually withdrawn and formal apologies were made.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/3790315.stm|title=Harrods apology over Hindu bikinis|publisher=BBC News |date= 2004-06-09|accessdate=2004-06-09}}</ref>

The Maktab Tarighat [[Uwaisi|Oveyssi]] Shahmaghsoudi school of [[Islamic]] [[Sufism]] accused Cavalli of copying their "sacred emblem" for branding the Just Cavalli line.<ref>{{cite web|title=Designer Cavalli soll islamisches Symbol entweiht haben|url=http://www.spiegel.de/panorama/leute/plagiat-roberto-cavalli-soll-islamisches-logo-entweiht-haben-a-968721.html|author=|language=German|trans-title=Designer Cavalli said to have desecrated Islamic symbol|publisher=Spiegel.de|accessdate=2015-09-26}}</ref>  The Sufi school brought forth a proceeding in Europe to the [[Office for Harmonization in the Internal Market]] (OHIM).
