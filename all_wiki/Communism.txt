Communism includes a variety of [[List of communist ideologies|schools of thought]] which broadly include [[Marxism]] and [[anarcho-communism]] as well as the [[political ideologies]] grouped around both, all of which share the analysis that the current order of society stems from [[Capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalism]], its [[economic system]] and [[mode of production]], namely that in this system there are two major social classes, [[Class conflict|conflict]] between these two classes is the root of all problems in society and this situation can only ultimately be resolved through a [[social revolution]].<ref name="Marx & Engels 1848">Marx, Karl, and [[Friedrich Engels]].

The two classes are the [[proletariat]] (the [[working class]]), who make up the majority of the population within society and must work to survive; and the [[bourgeoisie]] (the [[capitalist]] class), a small minority who derives profit from employing the working class through [[private ownership]] of the means of production.

== Etymology ==
''Communism'' derives from the [[French language|French]] ''communisme'' which developed out of the [[Latin language|Latin]] roots ''communis'' and the suffix ''isme''.<ref name=":1"/>

Semantically, ''communis'' can be translated to "of or for the community" while ''isme'' is a suffix that indicates the abstraction into a state, condition, action, or [[doctrine]]. ''Communism'' may be interpreted as "the state of being of or for the community". This semantic constitution has led to numerous usages of the word in its evolution. Prior to becoming associated with its more modern conception of an economic and political organization, the term was initially used in designating various social situations. The term ultimately came to be primarily associated with [[Marxism]], most specifically embodied in ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'' which proposed a particular type of communism.

One of the first uses of the word in its modern sense is in a letter sent by [[Victor d'Hupay]] to [[Restif de la Bretonne]] around 1785, in which d'Hupay describes himself as an ''auteur communiste'' ("communist author").<ref>{{cite journal|title=Quelques dates à propos des termes communiste et communisme|first=Jacques|last=Grandjonc|journal=Mots|year=1983|volume=7|issue=1|pages=143–148|language=fr|doi=10.3406/mots.1983.1122}}</ref> Years later, Restif would go on to use the term frequently in his writing and was the first to describe communism as a [[form of government]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://commoningtimes.org/texts/nancy-communism-the-word.pdf|title=Communism, the Word|last=Nancy|first=Jean-Luc|publisher=Commoning Times|year=1992|access-date=11 July 2019}}</ref> [[John Goodwyn Barmby]] is credited with the first use of the term in English, around 1840.<ref name=":1">Harper, Douglas.

=== Communism and socialism ===
Since the 1840s, ''communism'' has usually been distinguished from ''[[socialism]]''. The modern definition and usage of the latter would be settled by the 1860s, becoming the predominant term over the words ''[[Fourierism|associationist]]'', ''[[co-operative]]'' and ''[[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualist]]'' which had previously been used as synonyms. Instead, ''communism'' fell out of use during this period.<ref name="Williams 1985, p. 289">{{cite book|last=Williams|first=Raymond|title=Keywords: A Vocabulary of Culture and Society|edition=revised|location=New York|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1985|orig-year=1976|isbn=978-0-1952-0469-8|page=[https://archive.org/details/keywordsvocabula00willrich/page/289 289]|chapter=Socialism|oclc=1035920683|quote=The decisive distinction between socialist and communist, as in one sense these terms are now ordinarily used, came with the renaming, in 1918, of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party (Bolsheviks) as the All-Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks). From that time on, a distinction of socialist from communist, often with supporting definitions such as social democrat or democratic socialist, became widely current, although it is significant that all communist parties, in line with earlier usage, continued to describe themselves as socialist and dedicated to socialism.|chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/keywordsvocabula00willrich/page/289}}</ref> 

An early distinction between ''communism'' and ''socialism'' was that the latter aimed to only socialise [[Production (economics)|production]], whereas the former aimed to socialise both production and [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]] (in the form of free access to [[Final good|final goods]]).<ref>{{cite book|last=Steele|first=David|title=From Marx to Mises: Post-Capitalist Society and the Challenge of Economic Calculation|publisher=Open Court Publishing Company|year=1992|isbn=978-0-87548-449-5|pages=43|quote=One widespread distinction was that socialism socialised production only while communism socialised production and consumption.}}</ref> By 1888, Marxists employed ''socialism'' in place of ''communism'' which had come to be considered an old-fashioned synonym for the former. It was not until 1917, with the [[Bolshevik Revolution]], that ''socialism'' came to refer to a distinct stage between [[Capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalism]] and [[Communist society|communism]], introduced by [[Vladimir Lenin]] as a means to defend the [[Bolsheviks|Bolshevik]] seizure of power against traditional Marxist criticism that Russia's [[productive forces]] were not sufficiently developed for [[socialist revolution]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Steele|first=David|title=From Marx to Mises: Post-Capitalist Society and the Challenge of Economic Calculation|publisher=Open Court Publishing Company|year=1992|isbn=978-0-87548-449-5|pages=44–45|quote=By 1888, the term 'socialism' was in general use among Marxists, who had dropped 'communism', now considered an old fashioned term meaning the same as 'socialism'. [...] At the turn of the century, Marxists called themselves socialists.

Both ''communism'' and ''socialism'' eventually accorded with the cultural attitude of adherents and opponents towards [[religion]]. In [[Christendom|Christian Europe]], ''communism'' was believed to be the [[atheist]] way of life. In [[Protestantism in the United Kingdom|Protestant England]], the word ''communism'' was too [[phonetic]]ally similar to the Roman Catholic ''[[communion rite]]'', hence English atheists denoted themselves socialists.<ref>{{cite book|last=Williams|first=Raymond|title=Keywords: A Vocabulary of Culture and Society|edition=revised|location=New York|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1985|orig-year=1976|isbn=978-0-1952-0469-8|chapter=Socialism|chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/keywordsvocabula00willrich/page/289|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/keywordsvocabula00willrich}}</ref> [[Friedrich Engels]] argued that in 1848, at the time when ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'' was first published, "socialism was respectable on the continent, while communism was not". The [[Owenites]] in England and the [[Fourierists]] in France were considered respectable socialists while working-class movements that "proclaimed the necessity of total social change" denoted themselves ''communists''. This latter branch of socialism produced the communist work of [[Étienne Cabet]] in France and [[Wilhelm Weitling]] in Germany.<ref>[[Friedrich Engels|Engels, Friedrich]]. [1888] 2002. ''Preface to the 1888 English Edition of the Communist Manifesto''. [[Penguin Books|Penguin]]. p. 202.</ref> While democrats looked to the [[Revolutions of 1848]] as a [[democratic revolution]] which in the long run ensured [[Liberté, égalité, fraternité|liberty, equality and fraternity]], Marxists denounced 1848 as a betrayal of working-class ideals by a [[bourgeoisie]] indifferent to the legitimate demands of the [[proletariat]].<ref>[[Robert Gildea|Gildea, Robert]]. 2000.

According to ''The Oxford Handbook of Karl Marx'', "Marx used many terms to refer to a post-capitalist society—positive humanism, socialism, Communism, realm of free individuality, free association of producers, etc. He used these terms completely interchangeably. The notion that 'socialism' and 'Communism' are distinct historical stages is alien to his work and only entered the lexicon of Marxism after his death".<ref>Hudis, Peter; Vidal, Matt, Smith, Tony; Rotta, Tomás; Prew, Paul, eds.

Communist thought has also been traced back to the works of the 16th-century English writer [[Thomas More]]. In his 1516 [[treatise]] ''[[Utopia (book)|Utopia]]'', More portrayed a society based on [[common ownership]] of property, whose rulers administered it through the application of [[reason]]. In the 17th century, communist thought surfaced again in England, where a [[Puritan]] [[Religious denomination|religious group]] known as the [[Diggers]] advocated the abolition of private ownership of land.<ref name="diggers">{{cite web|url=http://www.rogerlovejoy.co.uk/philosophy/diggers/diggers3.htm|title=Diggers' Manifesto|access-date=July 19, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110709064100/http://www.rogerlovejoy.co.uk/philosophy/diggers/diggers3.htm|archive-date=July 9, 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> In his 1895 ''Cromwell and Communism'',{{sfn|Bernstein|1895}} [[Eduard Bernstein]] argued that several groups during the [[English Civil War]] (especially the Diggers) espoused clear communistic, [[Agrarianism|agrarian]] ideals and that [[Oliver Cromwell]]'s attitude towards these groups was at best ambivalent and often hostile.{{sfn|Bernstein|1895}} Criticism of the idea of private property continued into the [[Age of Enlightenment]] of the 18th century through such thinkers as [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] in France. Following the upheaval of the [[French Revolution]], communism later emerged as a political doctrine.<ref>Scott, John, and [[Gordon Marshall (sociologist)|Gordon Marshall]]. 2005. "Communism." ''A Dictionary of Sociology''. [[Oxford University Press|Oxford Reference Online]].</ref>

In the early 19th century, various social reformers founded communities based on common ownership. Unlike many previous communist communities, they replaced the religious emphasis with a rational and philanthropic basis.<ref name="britannica">"Communism" (2006). ''Encyclopædia Britannica''. ''Encyclopædia Britannica Online''.</ref> Notable among them were [[Robert Owen]], who founded [[New Harmony, Indiana]], in 1825; and [[Charles Fourier]], whose followers organized other settlements in the United States such as [[Brook Farm]] in 1841.<ref name=":0" />

In its modern form, communism grew out of the [[socialist movement]] in 19th-century Europe. As the [[Industrial Revolution]] advanced, socialist critics blamed capitalism for the misery of the [[proletariat]]—a new class of urban factory workers who labored under often-hazardous conditions. Foremost among these critics were [[Karl Marx]] and his associate [[Friedrich Engels]]. In 1848, Marx and Engels offered a new definition of communism and popularized the term in their famous pamphlet ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]''.<ref name=":0"/>

=== Soviet Union ===

[[File:Soviet Union - Russian SFSR (1922).svg|thumb|The [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russian SFSR]] as a part of the [[Soviet Union]] in 1922]]
The 1917 [[October Revolution]] in Russia set the conditions for the rise to state power of [[Vladimir Lenin]]'s [[Bolsheviks]] which was the first time any avowedly communist party reached that position. The revolution transferred power to the [[All-Russian Congress of Soviets]] in which the Bolsheviks had a majority.<ref name="or_soviets_1">[[David R.

''The Life and Times of Soviet Socialism''. p. 18.</ref> The event generated a great deal of practical and theoretical debate within the Marxist movement. Marx predicted that socialism and communism would be built upon foundations laid by the most advanced capitalist development. However, Russia was one of the poorest countries in Europe with an enormous, largely illiterate peasantry and a minority of industrial workers. Marx had explicitly stated that Russia might be able to skip the stage of bourgeois rule.<ref>[[Marc Edelman|Edelman, Marc]]. 1984. "Late Marx and the Russian road: Marx and the 'Peripheries of Capitalism'" (book reviews). ''[[Monthly Review]]'' (December).</ref>

The moderate [[Mensheviks]] (minority) opposed Lenin's Bolsheviks (majority) plan for [[Communist revolution|socialist revolution]] before capitalism was more fully developed. The Bolsheviks' successful rise to power was based upon the slogans such as "Peace, bread and land" which tapped into the massive public desire for an end to Russian involvement in [[World War I]], the peasants' demand for [[land reform]] and popular support for the [[Soviet (council)|soviets]].<ref>[[#Hol09|Holmes 2009]], p. 18.</ref> The [[Soviet Union]] was established in 1922.

Following Lenin's [[democratic centralism]], the Leninist parties were organized on a hierarchical basis, with active cells of members as the broad base. They were made up only of elite [[Professional revolutionaries|cadres]] approved by higher members of the party as being reliable and completely subject to [[party discipline]].<ref>[[Norman Davies]].

[[File:Marx et Engels à Shanghai.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|A monument dedicated to [[Karl Marx]] (left) and [[Friedrich Engels]] (right) in Shanghai]]
Marxism is a method of [[socioeconomic]] analysis that frames [[capitalism]] through a paradigm of exploitation, analyzes [[Social class|class]] relations and [[social conflict]] using a [[materialist]] interpretation of historical development and takes a [[dialectic]]al view of social transformation. Marxism uses a materialist methodology, referred to by Marx and Engels as the materialist conception of history and now better known as [[historical materialism]], to analyze and critique the development of class society and especially of [[Capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalism]] as well as the role of [[class struggle]]s in systemic economic, social and political change. First developed by [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] in the mid-19th century, it has been the foremost ideology of the communist movement. Marxism does not lay out a blueprint of a communist society ''per se'' and it merely presents an analysis that concludes the means by which its implementation will be triggered, distinguishing its fundamental characteristics as based on the derivation of real-life conditions. Marxism considers itself to be the embodiment of [[scientific socialism]], but it does not model an ideal society based on the design of [[intellectual]]s, whereby communism is seen as a [[State of affairs (sociology)|state of affairs]] to be established based on any intelligent design. Rather, it is a non-[[idealist]] attempt at the understanding of material history and society, whereby communism is the expression of a real movement, with parameters that are derived from actual life.<ref>[[Karl Marx|Marx, Karl]], and [[Friedrich Engels]]. 1845. "[https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/german-ideology/ch01a.htm Idealism and Materialism]." Part 1A in ''[[The German Ideology]]'' I, transcribed by T. Delaney, B. Schwartz, and B. Baggins. [https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/german-ideology/ch01a.htm#p48 § 5]. "Communism is for us not a state of affairs which is to be established, an ideal to which reality [will] have to adjust itself. We call communism the real movement which abolishes the present state of things. The conditions of this movement result from the premises now in existence."</ref>

According to [[Marxist theory]], class conflict arises in capitalist societies due to contradictions between the material interests of the oppressed and exploited [[proletariat]]—a class of wage labourers employed to produce goods and services—and the [[bourgeoisie]]—the [[ruling class]] that owns the [[means of production]] and extracts its wealth through appropriation of the [[surplus product]] produced by the proletariat in the form of [[Profit (economics)|profit]]. This class struggle that is commonly expressed as the revolt of a society's [[productive forces]] against its [[relations of production]], results in a period of short-term crises as the bourgeoisie struggle to manage the intensifying [[alienation of labor]] experienced by the proletariat, albeit with varying degrees of [[class consciousness]]. In periods of deep crisis, the resistance of the oppressed can culminate in a [[proletarian revolution]] which, if victorious, leads to the establishment of [[Socialist mode of production|socialism]]—a socioeconomic system based on [[social ownership]] of the means of production, [[To each according to his contribution|distribution based on one's contribution]] and [[Production for use|production organized directly for use]]. As the productive forces continued to advance, socialism would be transformed into a [[communist society]], i.e. a classless, stateless, humane society based on [[common ownership]] and [[From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs|distribution based on one's needs]].

While it originates from the works of Marx and Engels, Marxism has developed into many different branches and schools of thought, with the result that there is now no single definitive Marxist theory.<ref>{{cite book|last=Wolff and Resnick|first=Richard and Stephen|title=Economics: Marxian versus Neoclassical|url=https://archive.org/details/economicsmarxian00wolf_0|url-access=registration|publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press|date=August 1987|isbn=978-0-8018-3480-6|page=[https://archive.org/details/economicsmarxian00wolf_0/page/130 130]|quote=The German Marxists extended the theory to groups and issues Marx had barely touched.

The philosophy of orthodox Marxism includes the understanding that material development (advances in technology in the [[productive forces]]) is the primary agent of change in the structure of society and of human social relations and that social systems and their relations (e.g. [[feudalism]], [[capitalism]] and so on) become contradictory and inefficient as the productive forces develop, which results in some form of social revolution arising in response to the mounting contradictions. This revolutionary change is the vehicle for fundamental society-wide changes and ultimately leads to the emergence of new [[economic system]]s.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rees|first=John|title=The Algebra of Revolution: The Dialectic and the Classical Marxist Tradition|publisher=[[Routledge]]|date=July 1998|isbn=978-0415198776}}</ref> As a term, ''orthodox Marxism'' represents the methods of historical materialism and of dialectical materialism and not the normative aspects inherent to classical Marxism, without implying dogmatic adherence to the results of Marx's investigations.<ref>Lukács, Georg.

=== Marxist concepts ===
==== Class conflict and historical materialism ====
{{main|Class conflict|Historical materialism}}
At the root of Marxism is historical materialism, the [[materialist]] conception of history which holds that the key characteristic of economic systems through history has been the [[mode of production]] and that the change between modes of production has been triggered by class struggle. According to this analysis, the [[Industrial Revolution]] ushered the world into [[Capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalism]] as a new mode of production. Before capitalism, certain [[working class]]es had ownership of instruments utilized in production. However, because machinery was much more efficient, this property became worthless and the mass majority of workers could only survive by selling their labor to make use of someone else's machinery, thus making someone else profit. Accordingly, capitalism divided the world between two major classes, namely that of the [[proletariat]] and the [[bourgeoisie]].<ref>Engels, Friedrich. Marx & Engels Selected Works, Volume One, pp. 81–97, Progress Publishers, Moscow, 1969. "Principles of Communism". No. 4 – "How did the proletariat originate?".</ref> These classes are directly antagonistic as the latter possesses [[private ownership]] of the [[means of production]], earning profit via the [[surplus value]] generated by the proletariat, who have no ownership of the means of production and therefore no option but to sell its labor to the bourgeoisie.

According to the materialist conception of history, it is through the furtherance of its own material interests that the rising bourgeoisie within [[feudalism]] captured power and abolished, of all relations of private property, only the feudal privilege, thereby taking the feudal [[ruling class]] out of existence. This was another key element behind the consolidation of capitalism as the new mode of production, the final expression of class and property relations that has led to a massive expansion of production. It is only in capitalism that private property in itself can be abolished.<ref>[[Friedrich Engels|Engels, Friedrich]]. [1847] 1969. "[https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1847/11/prin-com.htm#015 Was not the abolition of private property possible at an earlier time?]" Sec. 15 in ''[[Principles of Communism]]'', (''[[Marx/Engels Collected Works]]'' I, pp. 81–97). Moscow: [[Progress Publishers]].</ref> Similarly, the proletariat would capture political power, abolish bourgeois property through the [[common ownership]] of the means of production, therefore abolishing the bourgeoisie, ultimately abolishing the proletariat itself and ushering the world into [[Communist society|communism as a new mode of production]]. In between capitalism and communism, there is the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]], a democratic state where the whole of the public authority is elected and recallable under the basis of [[universal suffrage]].<ref>Thomas M. Twiss. ''Trotsky and the Problem of Soviet Bureaucracy''. Brill. pp. 28–29.</ref> It is the defeat of the [[bourgeois state]], but not yet of the capitalist mode of production and at the same time the only element which places into the realm of possibility moving on from this mode of production.

==== Marxian economics ====
{{main|Marxian economics}}
Marxian economics and its proponents view capitalism as economically unsustainable and incapable of improving the living standards of the population due to its need to compensate for [[Tendency of the rate of profit to fall|falling rates of profit]] by cutting employee's wages, social benefits and pursuing military aggression. The [[Socialist mode of production|communist system]] would succeed capitalism as humanity's mode of production through workers' [[revolution]]. According to Marxian [[crisis theory]], communism is not an inevitability, but an economic necessity.<ref>Free will, non-predestination and non-determinism are emphasized in Marx's famous quote "Men make their own history". ''The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte'' (1852).</ref>

==== Socialization versus nationalization ====
{{main|Socialization (economics)|Socialization (Marxism)}}
An important concept in Marxism is [[Social ownership|socialization]] versus [[nationalization]]. Nationalization is [[state ownership]] of property whereas socialization is control and management of property by society. Marxism considers the latter as its goal and considers nationalization a tactical issue, as state ownership is still in the realm of the [[Capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist mode of production]]. In the words of [[Friedrich Engels]], "the transformation [...] into State-ownership does not do away with the capitalistic nature of the productive forces. [...] State-ownership of the productive forces is not the solution of the conflict, but concealed within it are the technical conditions that form the elements of that solution".<ref name=":0" group="lower-alpha">[[Friedrich Engels|Engels, Friedrich]]. [1880] 1970. [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1880/soc-utop/ch03.htm "Historical Materialism"]. "But, the transformation—either into joint-stock companies and trusts, or into State-ownership—does not do away with the capitalistic nature of the productive forces. In the joint-stock companies and trusts, this is obvious. And the modern State, again, is only the organization that bourgeois society takes on in order to support the external conditions of the capitalist mode of production against the encroachments as well of the workers as of individual capitalists. The modern state, no matter what its form, is essentially a capitalist machine—the state of the capitalists, the ideal personification of the total national capital. The more it proceeds to the taking over of productive forces, the more does it actually become the national capitalist, the more citizens does it exploit. The workers remain wage-workers—proletarians. The capitalist relation is not done away with. It is, rather, brought to a head. But, brought to a head, it topples over. State-ownership of the productive forces is not the solution of the conflict, but concealed within it are the technical conditions that form the elements of that solution."</ref><ref name=":2">[[Friedrich Engels|Engels, Friedrich]].

Leninism is the body of [[political theory]], developed by and named after the [[Russian Revolution|Russian revolutionary]] and later-[[Premier of the Soviet Union|Soviet premier]] [[Vladimir Lenin]], for the democratic organisation of a revolutionary [[vanguard party]] and the achievement of a [[Dictatorship of the proletariat#Vladimir Lenin|dictatorship of the proletariat]] as political prelude to the establishment of [[Socialist mode of production|socialism]]. Leninism comprises [[Types of socialism|socialist]] political and [[Economic theory|economic theories]] developed from [[orthodox Marxism]] as well as Lenin's interpretations of Marxist theory for practical application to the [[Sociopolitical|socio-political]] conditions of the [[Agrarianism|agrarian]], early-20th-century [[Russian Empire]].

Leninism was composed for revolutionary [[Praxis (process)|praxis]] and originally was neither a rigorously proper philosophy nor a discrete political theory. After the Russian Revolution and in ''[[History and Class Consciousness|History and Class Consciousness: Studies in Marxist Dialectics]]'' (1923), [[György Lukács]] developed and organised Lenin's pragmatic revolutionary practices and ideology into the formal philosophy of vanguard-party revolution. As a political-science term, ''Leninism'' entered common usage in 1922 after infirmity ended Lenin's participation in governing the Russian Communist Party. At the Fifth Congress of the [[Communist International]] in July 1924, [[Grigory Zinoviev]] popularized the term ''Leninism'' to denote "vanguard-party revolution".

Within Leninism, [[democratic centralism]] is a practice in which political decisions reached by voting processes are binding upon all members of the [[communist party]]. The party's political vanguard is composed of professional revolutionaries that elect leaders and officers as well as to determine policy through free discussion, then this is decisively realized through united action. In the context of the theory of Leninist revolutionary struggle, [[vanguardism]] is a strategy whereby the most class-conscious and politically advanced sections of the [[proletariat]] or working class, described as the revolutionary vanguard, form organizations in order to draw larger sections of the working class towards revolutionary politics and serve as manifestations of proletarian political power against its [[class enemies]].

From 1917 to 1922, Leninism was the Russian application of [[Marxian economics]] and political philosophy, effected and realised by the [[Bolsheviks]], the vanguard party who led the fight for the [[political independence]] of the [[working class]]. In the 1925–1929 period, [[Joseph Stalin]] established his interpretation of Leninism as the official and only legitimate form of Marxism in Russia by amalgamating the political philosophies as [[Marxism–Leninism]] which then became the [[Ideology of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|state ideology]] of the Soviet Union.

==== Marxism–Leninism ====
{{main|Marxism–Leninism}}
Marxism–Leninism is a political ideology developed by [[Joseph Stalin]].<ref name="made_by_stalin">Lisichkin, G. 1989. "Мифы и реальность, Новый мир" {{in lang|ru}}. ''[[Novy Mir]]'' 3. p. 59.</ref> According to its proponents, it is based in [[Marxism]] and [[Leninism]]. It describes the specific political ideology which Stalin implemented in the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] and in a global scale in the [[Comintern]]. There is no definite agreement between historians of about whether Stalin actually followed the principles of Marx and Lenin.<ref name="stalin_follow_marx_lenin">Александр Бутенко (Aleksandr Butenko), Социализм сегодня: опыт и новая теория// Журнал Альтернативы, №1, 1996, pp. 2–22 {{in lang|ru}}.</ref> It also contains aspects which according to some are deviations from Marxism such as [[socialism in one country]].<ref name="sioc1">''[[Contemporary Marxism]]'' (4–5).

[[Social fascism]] was a theory supported by the Comintern and affiliated [[communist parties]] during the early 1930s which held that [[social democracy]] was a variant of [[fascism]] because it stood in the way of a [[dictatorship of the proletariat]], in addition to a shared [[corporatist]] economic model.<ref name="Haro 2011">{{cite journal|last=Haro|first=Lea|year=2011|title=Entering a Theoretical Void: The Theory of Social Fascism and Stalinism in the German Communist Party|journal=[[Critique: Journal of Socialist Theory]]|volume=39|issue=4|pages=563–582|doi=10.1080/03017605.2011.621248|s2cid=146848013}}</ref> At the time, leaders of the Comintern such as Stalin and [[Rajani Palme Dutt]] argued that [[Capitalism|capitalist]] society had entered the [[Third Period]] in which a [[Proletariat revolution|working-class revolution]] was imminent, but it could be prevented by social democrats and other ''fascist'' forces.<ref name="Haro 2011"/><ref name="Hoppe 2011">{{cite book|last=Hoppe|first=Bert|year=2011|title=In Stalins Gefolgschaft: Moskau und die KPD 1928–1933|publisher=Oldenbourg Verlag|language=de|isbn=9783486711738}}</ref> The term ''social fascist'' was used pejoratively to describe social-democratic parties, anti-Comintern and progressive socialist parties and dissenters within Comintern affiliates throughout the [[interwar period]]. The social fascism theory was advocated vociferously by the [[Communist Party of Germany]] which was largely controlled and funded by the Soviet leadership from 1928.<ref name="Hoppe 2011"/>

During the Cold War, Marxism–Leninism was the ideology of the most clearly visible communist movement and is the most prominent ideology associated with communism.<ref name="Columbia"/> According to their proponents, Marxist–Leninist ideologies have been adapted to the material conditions of their respective countries and include [[Castroism]] (Cuba), [[National communism in Romania|Ceaușism]] (Romania), [[Gonzalo Thought]] (Peru), [[Guevarism]] (Cuba), [[Ho Chi Minh Thought]] (Vietnam), [[Hoxhaism]] (anti-revisionist Albania), [[Husakism]] (Czechoslovakia), [[Juche]] (North Korea), [[Kadarism]] (Hungary), [[Khmer Rouge]] (Cambodia), [[Khrushchevism]] (Soviet Union), [[Prachanda Path]] (Nepal), [[Shining Path]] (Peru) and [[Titoism]] (anti-Stalinist Yugoslavia).

Within Marxism–Leninism, [[anti-revisionism]] is a position which emerged in the 1950s in opposition to the [[Khrushchev Thaw|reforms]] of Soviet leader [[Nikita Khrushchev]]. Where Khrushchev pursued an interpretation that differed from Stalin, the anti-revisionists within the international communist movement remained dedicated to Stalin's ideological legacy and criticized the Soviet Union under Khrushchev and his successors as [[state capitalist]] and [[social imperialist]] due to its hopes of achieving peace with the United States. The term ''Stalinism'' is also used to describe these positions, but it is often not used by its supporters who opine that Stalin simply synthesized and practiced [[orthodox Marxism]] and Leninism. Because different political trends trace the historical roots of revisionism to different eras and leaders, there is significant disagreement today as to what constitutes anti-revisionism. Modern groups which describe themselves as anti-revisionist fall into several categories. Some uphold the works of Stalin and [[Mao Zedong]] and some the works of Stalin while rejecting Mao and universally tend to oppose [[Trotskyism]]. Others reject both Stalin and Mao, tracing their ideological roots back to Marx and Lenin. In addition, other groups uphold various less-well-known historical leaders such as [[Enver Hoxha]], who also broke with Mao during the [[Sino-Albanian split]].

Within Marxism–Leninism, ''social imperialism'' was a term used by Mao to criticize the Soviet Union post-Stalin. Mao argued that the Soviet Union had itself become an [[imperialist]] power while maintaining a socialist façade.<ref>{{cite web | title=Mao, (1964), "On Khrushchev's Phoney Communism and Its Historical Lessons for the World" | url=http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/mao/works/1964/phnycom.htm | access-date=January 23, 2009 }}</ref> Hoxha agreed with Mao in this analysis, before later using the expression to also condemn Mao's [[Three Worlds Theory]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Hoxha, E., (1979), "Imperialism and the Revolution: The Theory of 'Three Worlds': A Counterrevolutionary Chauvinist Theory"|url=http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hoxha/works/imp_rev/imp_ch4.htm|access-date=January 23, 2009}}</ref>

===== Maoism =====
{{main|Maoism|Marxism–Leninism–Maoism}}
[[File:Mao Statue at Zhong Shan Guang Chang.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Long Live the Victory of Mao Zedong Thought]] monument in Shenyang]]
Maoism is the theory derived from the teachings of the Chinese political leader [[Mao Zedong]]. Developed from the 1950s until the [[Deng Xiaoping]] [[Chinese economic reform]] in the 1970s, it was widely applied as the guiding political and military ideology of the [[Communist Party of China]] and as the theory guiding [[Revolutionary movement|revolutionary movements]] around the world. A key difference between Maoism and other forms of Marxism–Leninism is that [[peasant]]s should be the bulwark of the revolutionary energy which is led by the working class.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Meisner|first=Maurice|date=January–March 1971|title=Leninism and Maoism: Some Populist Perspectives on Marxism-Leninism in China|journal=The China Quarterly|volume=45|issue=45|pages=2–36|doi=10.1017/S0305741000010407|jstor=651881}}</ref>

The synthesis of Marxism–Leninism–Maoism which builds upon the two individual theories as the Chinese adaption of Marxism–Leninism did not occur during the life of Mao. After [[de-Stalinization]], Marxism–Leninism was kept in the [[Soviet Union]] while certain [[Anti-revisionism|anti-revisionist]] tendencies such as [[Hoxhaism]] and Maoism argued that such had deviated from its original concept. Different policies were applied in [[Albania]] and [[China]] which became more distanced from the Soviet Union. From the 1960s, groups who called themselves ''Maoists'', or those who upheld Maoism, were not unified around a common understanding of Maoism, instead having their own particular interpretations of the political, philosophical, economical and military works of Mao. Its adherents claims that as a unified, coherent higher stage of Marxism, it was not consolidated until the 1980s, first being formalized by the [[Communism in Peru|Peruvian communist party]] [[Shining Path]] in 1982.<ref name="On Marxism-Leninism-Maoism">{{cite web|date=1982|title=On Marxism-Leninism-Maoism|url=http://library.redspark.nu/1982_-_Maoism._On_Marxism-Leninism-Maoism|access-date=20 January 2020|website=MLM Library|publisher=Communist Party of Peru}}</ref> Through the experience of the [[people's war]] waged by the party, the Shining Path were able to posit Maoism as the newest development of Marxism.<ref name="On Marxism-Leninism-Maoism"/>

Proponents of Marxism–Leninism–Maoism refer to the theory as ''Maoism'' itself whereas ''Maoism'' is referred to as either ''Mao Zedong Thought'' or ''Marxism–Leninism–Mao Zedong Thought''. [[Maoism–Third Worldism]] is concerned with the infusion and [[Thesis, antithesis, synthesis|synthesis]] of Marxism–Leninism–Maoism with concepts of non-Marxist [[Third-Worldism]] such [[dependency theory]] and [[world-systems theory]].

==== Trotskyism ====
{{main|Trotskyism}}
[[File:Mexico - Bellas Artes - Fresque Riviera « Man at the Crossroads ».JPG|thumb|Detail of ''Man, Controller of the Universe'', fresco at [[Palacio de Bellas Artes]] in Mexico City showing [[Leon Trotsky]], [[Friedrich Engels]] and [[Karl Marx]]]]
Trotskyism, developed by [[Leon Trotsky]] in opposition to [[Stalinism]], is a Marxist and Leninist tendency that supports the theory of [[permanent revolution]] and [[world revolution]] rather than the [[two-stage theory]] and [[Joseph Stalin]]'s [[socialism in one country]]. It supported [[proletarian internationalism]] and another communist revolution in the [[Soviet Union]]. Rather than representing the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]], Trotsky claimed that the Soviet Union had become a [[degenerated workers' state]] under the leadership of Stalin in which class relations had re-emerged in a new form. Trotsky's politics differed sharply from those of Stalin and [[Mao Zedong]], most importantly in declaring the need for an international proletarian revolution—rather than socialism in one country—and support for a true dictatorship of the proletariat based on democratic principles.

Struggling against Stalin for power in the Soviet Union, Trotsky and his supporters organized into the [[Left Opposition]], the platform of which became known as Trotskyism. Stalin eventually succeeded in gaining control of the Soviet regime and Trotskyist attempts to remove Stalin from power resulted in Trotsky's exile from the Soviet Union in 1929. While in exile, Trotsky continued his campaign against Stalin, founding in 1938 the [[Fourth International]], a Trotskyist rival to the Comintern. In August 1940, Trotsky was assassinated in [[Mexico City]] upon Stalin's orders. Trotskyist currents include [[orthodox Trotskyism]], [[third camp]], [[Posadism]], [[Pabloism]] and [[neo-Trotskyism]].

In Trotskyist political theory, a degenerated workers' state is a dictatorship of the proletariat in which the working class's democratic control over the state has given way to control by a bureaucratic clique. The term was developed by Trotsky in ''[[The Revolution Betrayed]]'' and in other works. [[Deformed workers' states]] are states where the capitalist class has been overthrown, the economy is largely state-owned and planned, but there is no internal democracy or workers' control of industry. In a deformed workers' state, the working class has never held political power like it did in Russia shortly after the [[Bolshevik Revolution]]. These states are considered deformed because their political and economic structures have been imposed from the top (or from outside) and because revolutionary working class organizations are crushed. Like a degenerated workers' state, a deformed workers' state cannot be said to be a state that is transitioning to socialism. Most Trotskyists cite examples of deformed workers' states today as including [[Cuba]], the [[People's Republic of China]], [[North Korea]] and [[Vietnam]]. The [[Committee for a Workers' International]] has also included states such as [[Burma]] and [[Syria]] at times when they have had a [[nationalized]] economy.

==== Eurocommunism ====
{{main|Eurocommunism}}
[[File:Enrico Berlinguer.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Enrico Berlinguer]], the secretary of the [[Italian Communist Party]] and main proponent of Eurocommunism]]
Eurocommunism was a [[Revisionism (Marxism)|revisionist]] trend in the 1970s and 1980s within various [[Western Europe|Western European]] communist parties, claiming to develop a theory and practice of [[social transformation]] more relevant to their region. Especially prominent in [[Italy]], [[France]] and [[Spain]], communists of this nature sought to undermine the influence of the [[Soviet Union]] and its [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|communist party]] during the [[Cold War]].<ref>Kingsley, Richard, ed. 1981.

==== Council communism ====
{{main|Council communism}}
[[File:Rosa Luxemburg.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|[[Rosa Luxemburg]]]]
Council communism is a movement originating in Germany and the Netherlands in the 1920s, whose primary organization was the [[Communist Workers Party of Germany]]. Council communism continues today as a theoretical and activist position within both [[libertarian Marxism]] and [[libertarian socialism]].

The core principle of council communism is that the government and the economy should be managed by [[Workers' council]]s which are composed of [[Delegate model of representation|delegates]] elected at workplaces and [[Recall election|recallable]] at any moment. As such, council communists oppose [[Planned economy|state-run]] [[authoritarian]] [[state socialism]] and [[state capitalism]]. They also oppose the idea of a revolutionary party since council communists believe that a revolution led by a party will necessarily produce a party dictatorship. Council communists support a workers' democracy, produced through a federation of workers' councils.

Accordingly, the central argument of council communism in contrast to those of [[social democracy]] and [[Leninist]] communism is that democratic workers' councils arising in the factories and municipalities are the natural form of working-class organization and governmental power. This view is opposed to both the [[reformist]] and the Leninism ideologies which respectively stress parliamentary and [[New institutionalism|institutional]] government by applying [[Reform movement|social reforms]] on the one hand and [[Vanguard party|vanguard parties]] and [[Participatory democracy|participative]] [[democratic centralism]] on the other.

==== Left communism ====
{{main|Left communism}}
Left communism is the range of communist viewpoints held by the communist left which criticizes the political ideas and practices espoused, particularly following the series of revolutions that brought [[World War ]] to an end by [[Bolsheviks]] and [[social democrats]]. Left communists assert positions which they regard as more authentically [[Marxist]] and [[proletarian]] than the views of [[Marxism–Leninism]] espoused by the [[Communist International]] after its [[1st Congress of the Comintern|first congress]] (March 1919) and during its [[2nd World Congress of the Comintern|second congress]] (July–August 1920).<ref>''Non-Leninist Marxism: Writings on the Workers Councils'' (includes texts by [[Herman Gorter|Gorter]], [[Antonie Pannekoek|Pannekoek]], [[Sylvia Pankhurst|Pankhurst]] and [[Otto Rühle|Rühle]]).  St. Petersburg, FL: Red and Black Publishers. 2007. {{ISBN|978-0-9791813-6-8}}.</ref>

Left communists represent a range of political movements distinct from [[Marxist–Leninists]], whom they largely view as merely the left-wing of [[Capital (economics)|capital]]; from [[anarcho-communists]], some of whom they consider to be [[internationalist socialists]]; and from various other revolutionary socialist tendencies such as [[De Leonists]], whom they tend to see as being internationalist socialists only in limited instances.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.internationalism.org/book/export/html/761|title=The Legacy of De Leonism, part III: De Leon's misconceptions on class struggle|date=2000–2001|website=Internationalism}}</ref>

Anarcho-communism differs from Marxism in that it rejects its view about the need for a [[state socialism]] phase prior to establishing communism. [[Peter Kropotkin]], the main theorist of anarcho-communism, argued that a revolutionary society should "transform itself immediately into a communist society", that it should go immediately into what Marx had regarded as the "more advanced, completed, phase of communism".<ref name="theanarchistlibrary.org">{{cite book|url=http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Wayne_Price__What_is_Anarchist_Communism_.html|title="What is Anarchist Communism?" by Wayne Price|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101221140615/http://theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Wayne_Price__What_is_Anarchist_Communism_.html|archive-date=December 21, 2010|url-status=dead|access-date=January 19, 2011}}</ref> In this way, it tries to avoid the reappearance of "[[Social stratification|class divisions]] and the need for a state to oversee everything".<ref name="theanarchistlibrary.org"/>

During the [[Russian Civil War]], anarchists such as [[Nestor Makhno]] worked through the [[Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine]] to create and defend anarcho-communism in the Free Territory of the Ukraine from 1919 before being conquered by the [[Bolsheviks]] in 1921. In 1929, anarcho-communism was achieved in Korea by the Korean Anarchist Federation in Manchuria (KAFM) and the Korean Anarcho-Communist Federation (KACF), with help from anarchist general and independence activist [[Kim Chwa-chin]], lasting until 1931, when [[Imperial Japan]] assassinated Kim and invaded from the south while the [[Chinese Nationalists]] invaded from the north, resulting in the creation of [[Manchukuo]], a puppet state of the [[Empire of Japan]]. Through the efforts and influence of the [[Anarchism in Spain|Spanish anarchists]] during the Spanish Revolution within the [[Spanish Civil War]], starting in 1936 anarcho-communism existed in most of [[Aragon]]; parts of the [[Levante, Spain|Levante]] and [[Andalusia]]; and in the [[Fortification|stronghold]] of [[Revolutionary Catalonia]], before being brutally crushed.

=== Christian communism ===
{{main|Christian communism}}
Christian communism is a form of [[religious communism]] based on [[Christianity]]. It is a [[Theology|theological]] and political theory based upon the view that the teachings of [[Jesus in Christianity|Jesus Christ]] compel Christians to support communism as the ideal [[social system]]. Although there is no universal agreement on the exact date when Christian communism was founded, many Christian communists assert that evidence from the [[Bible]] suggests that the first Christians, including the [[Acts of Apostles|Apostles]], established their own small communist society in the years following [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Jesus' death]] and [[Resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]]. Many advocates of Christian communism argue that it was taught by Jesus and practiced by the Apostles themselves.

Christian communism can be seen as a radical form of [[Christian socialism]]. Christian communists may or may not agree with various aspects of [[Marxism]]. They do not agree with the [[Marxism and religion|atheist and anti-religious views held by secular Marxists]], but they do agree with many of the economic and existential aspects of Marxist theory, such as the idea that [[capitalism]] exploits the [[working class]] by extracting [[surplus value]] from the workers in the form of [[Profit (economics)|profits]] and the idea that [[Wage labour|wage labor]] is a tool of human [[Social alienation|alienation]] that promotes arbitrary and unjust [[authority]]. Christian communism holds that capitalism encourages the negative aspects of humans, supplanting values such as mercy, kindness, justice and compassion in favor of greed, selfishness and blind ambition.

== Criticism ==
{{main|Criticism of communist party rule|Criticism of Marxism}}
{{see also|Anti-communism}}
Criticism of communism can be divided into two broad categories, namely that which concerns itself with the practical aspects of 20th century [[communist state]]s<ref name="Bruno Bosteels 2014">[[Bruno Bosteels|Bosteels, Bruno]]. 2014. ''The Actuality of Communism''. Verso Books.</ref> and that which concerns itself with communist principles and theory.<ref>[[Raymond Taras|Taras, Raymond C.]] 2015. ''The Road to Disillusion: From Critical Marxism to Post-communism in Eastern Europe''. [[Routledge]].</ref>

Marxism is also subject to general criticism such as that it requires necessary suppression of [[Liberal democracy|liberal democratic rights]], that there are issues with the implementation of communism, and that there are economic issues such as the distortion or absence of [[price signal]]s. In addition, [[Empiricism|empirical]] and [[Epistemology|epistemological]] problems are frequently cited.<ref name="howard">Howard, M. C., and J. E. King. 1992.
