{{more citations needed|section|date=January 2017}}

===2006–2009: Early career===
[[File:Petra Martic RG 2009.jpg|thumb|right|At the 2009 French Open]]
The best result in her junior career was the quarterfinals in [[2006 U.S. Open - Girls' Singles#Section 3|2006 US Open]]. In 2007, she played her first [[WTA Tour]] main draw at Miami falling in first round as a wild card to Russian [[Alina Jidkova]]. In 2008, Martić won the ITF [[Zagreb Open]], defeating [[Yvonne Meusburger]], and then made it to the quarterfinals of the WTA event [[Banka Koper Slovenia Open|Slovenia Open]], losing to [[Julia Görges]].

She qualified for the [[2009 French Open – Women's Singles|2009 French Open]] and lost in the second round to 21-year-old Canadian world No. 24 [[Aleksandra Wozniak]]. She then made it to another Portorož Open quarterfinal, losing to defending champion and fifth seed [[Sara Errani]]. In September 2009, at the age of 18 years and 8 months, Martić entered top 100 for the first time (year-end ranking was No. 82).

===2010: First top-20 victory===
Martić began the season by falling in the qualifying stages of the [[WTA Auckland Open|ASB Classic]] (lost to [[Chanelle Scheepers]]) and the [[Medibank International Sydney]] (lost to [[Kimiko Date-Krumm]]). She lost in the first round of the Australian Open, falling to [[Sabine Lisicki]].

[[File:Petra Martic 1, Wimbledon 2013 - Diliff.jpg|thumb|right|Serving at the 2013 Wimbledon Championships]]

===2013-2016: Struggling with injuries ===
The next four years of her career were plagued by injuries and poor form. In 2013, Martić made it to the third round of a WTA tournament only twice, at Katowice and Wimbledon. She also won the 2013 ITF Nottingham (def. [[Karolina Pliskova]] in the final), but dropped out of the top 100 by the end of the year. In 2014, she scored only one WTA main-draw victory, against [[Sorana Cirstea]] in Guangzhou in September. In 2015, Martić mostly played at the ITF and 125K series tournaments, with moderate success. The only notable result was qualifying for the Australian Open (lost to Sharapova). She finished her 2015 season in October, not scoring a single victory at a WTA event main draw and only two top-100 victories during the year. She was ranked 148 at the end of the year.

In February 2016, she made it to the semifinals of a WTA event for the first time in four years at Rio de Janeiro in February (def. No. 1 seed [[Teliana Pereira]], lost to [[Francesca Schiavone]]), and did not play from February to May. The last match she played was at Wimbledon in June, where she lost to U. Radwańska in the first round of qualifying. In September, she dropped out of the top 200.

===2017-2018: Making a comeback===
Suffering from a major back injury (disc protrusion in her lower back), Martić was not sure if she would play competitive tennis again.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tportal.hr/sport/clanak/petra-martic-razmisljala-sam-hocu-li-vise-ikad-igrati-tenis-20170604|title=Razmisljala sam hocu li ikada vise igrati tenis}}</ref>

After a ten-month injury lay-off, she made a come-back at $25k event at Santa Margherita di Pula. Ranked No. 659, Martić had to go through qualifying, and in the end, won the tournament (def. von Deichmann in the final). She then went on a 17–3 run leading up to 2017 French Open, where she qualified (despite being down a match point in the third round of qualifying against [[Maryna Zanevska]]), and won three rounds in the main draw, losing to [[Elina Svitolina]] after being up 5–2 in the third set.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tennis-university.com/made-it-back-into-the-top-40-petra-martic/page/2/?lang=en| title= Made it back to TOP 40 - Petra Martic}}</ref> Along the way, she defeated [[Madison Keys]] and [[Anastasija Sevastova]] - her first top-20 victories in five years. At Wimbledon, she again went through qualifying rounds and upset [[Daria Gavrilova]] on her way to her second consecutive fourth-round appearance at a Grand Slam (and third overall). After Wimbledon, Martić played only four more tournaments, going 2–4, but finished the year in top 100 for the first time since 2012.

Continuing her success from 2017, Martić made it to the fourth round of the 2018 Australian Open (lost to [[Elise Mertens]] 6–7, 5–7), and reached her first quarterfinal at a Premier Mandatory in Indian Wells (def. No. 6 [[Jelena Ostapenko]], lost to [[Simona Halep]] in three sets). She made it to the final of Bucharest, her first WTA final after 2012 Kuala Lumpur, (def. Siegemund and Buzarnescu, lost to Sevastova). In September, Martić won the WTA 125k at Chicago (def. [[Mona Barthel]]) and finished year at No. 32 for the second year-end top-50 finish of her career.

===2019: First WTA title, first major quarterfinal, top 20 debut===
After a slow start to the year (going 3–5 in the first five tournaments of the year), Martić reached the semifinals of [[WTA Charleston]] in April, defeating [[Belinda Bencic]] along the way. Then she followed it with her first WTA trophy at [[Istanbul|İstanbul Cup]], defeating [[Marketa Vondrousova]] in the final, after losing the first set 1–6.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tennisnow.com/News/2019/April/Petra-Martic-Wins-Maiden-Title-at-Istanbul.aspx|title=Petra Martic Wins Maiden title at Istanbul}}</ref> Martic then made it to the quarterfinals of the [[Madrid Open]], defeating Muguruza and Vekic along the way. In April, she was nominated for the WTA Player of the Month.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wtatennis.com/news/vote-april-2019-player-month|title=Vote: April 2019 Player of the Month}}</ref> On the 13th of May, she entered the top 30 for the first time in her career - seven years, seven months and 18 days after first entering the top 50.

At the [[2019 French Open|French Open]], seeded 31st, she defeated [[Ons Jabeur]] and [[Kristina Mladenovic]] to reach the third round where she upset second seed Karolína Plíšková. She defeated [[Kaia Kanepi]] in the fourth round to reach her first ever Grand Slam quarterfinal.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wtatennis.com/news/emotions-played-big-role-today-martic-battles-back-make-grand-slam-qf-debut-paris|title=Martic battles back to make Grand Slam QF debut in Paris}}</ref> There, she was defeated by [[Markéta Vondroušová]].

Martić then reached her first-ever grass-court semifinal at WTA Birmingham (saved five match points against Ostapenko in the quarterfinals, lost to Görges in semifinal) and reached the fourth round of Wimbledon, equaling her best result at this tournament. Following Wimbledon, she broke into the top 20 for the first time.

Martić didn't find much success during the beginning of the summer hard-court season, losing her opening round matches in [[2019 Rogers Cup – Women's Singles|Toronto]] and [[2019 Western & Southern Open – Women's Singles|Cincinnati]], but rebounded at the [[2019 US Open (tennis)|US Open]] by reaching the third round there for the first time. She then upset world No. 11, Anastasija Sevastova (who was carrying a streak of three straight US Open quarterfinal appearances), to reach the second week of a major for the third consecutive time. She lost to [[Serena Williams]] in the fourth round in straight sets. Martić carried her momentum to the start of the Asian hard-court swing. In [[2019 Zhengzhou Open|Zhengzhou]], she reached her first Premier-level final, after beating [[Aryna Sabalenka]] in the quarterfinals and former top-10 player Kristina Mladenovic in the semifinals to face Plíšková for the first time since upsetting her at the French Open. However, Martić was unable to repeat that result, as she was defeated by the world No. 2 in straight sets.

===2020: Two WTA Tour semifinals===
Martic had another slow start to the year losing in the second round of [[2020 ASB Classic – Women's Singles|2020 ASB Classic]] and the [[2020 Australian Open|Australian Open]] (which ended her streak of reaching the second week of majors), as well as being upset in the opening round of [[Hua Hin Championships|Hua Hin]]. Then she made an impressive run into the semifinals of [[2020 Dubai Tennis Championships – Women's Singles|Dubai Championships]] without dropping a set before falling to [[Elena Rybakina]] in two tie-break sets. However, she was upset by [[Barbora Strýcová]] in the first round of the [[2020 Qatar Total Open|Qatar Open]]. After the assumption of the WTA Tour in August, Martic reached her second semifinal of the year in [[2020 Internazionali Femminili di Palermo|Palermo]] before falling to [[Anett Kontaveit]] in straight sets. She then participated in the [[Prague Open]] where she beat [[Varvara Gracheva]] in straight sets before being upset in straight sets by [[Kristýna Plíšková]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wtatennis.com/news/1752143/pliskova-purple-patch-overpowers-martic-in-prague|title=Pliskova purple patch overpowers Martic in Prague}}</ref>

==Playing style==
Martić employs an aggressive all-court game that exemplifies her variety. Her groundstrokes are powerful, and is able to hit both her forehand and her backhand flat, and with topspin. She is also proficient at hitting her backhand with slice, and can incorporate the drop shot effectively into points. Her serve is powerful, and has been recorded at 120 mph (194 km/h), and is also reliable, allowing her to hit many aces throughout a match, whilst minimising double faults. Her return of serve is also a major weapon, ranking consistently within the top 100 of the WTA for return games won. She is a strong volleyer, due to her doubles experience, and is as comfortable at the net as she is at the baseline. She is capable of extending rallies, acting more like a counterpuncher, to draw unforced errors out of highly aggressive players. Martić possesses a remarkably unique game, containing an almost complete repertoire of shots.

'''Notes'''
*<sup>{{note label|WTA Elite Trophy|1|1}}</sup> [[WTA Tournament of Champions]] was held from 2009 to 2014, when [[WTA Elite Trophy]] replaced it.
*<sup>{{note label|Doha/Dubai|2|2}}</sup> The first [[WTA Premier tournaments|Premier 5]] event of the year has switched back and forth between the [[Dubai Tennis Championships]] and the [[Qatar Ladies Open|Qatar Open]] since 2009. Dubai was classified as a Premier 5 event from 2009–2011 before being succeeded by Doha for the 2012–2014 period. In 2015, Dubai regained its Premier 5 status while Doha was demoted to Premier status. The two tournaments have since alternated status every year.
*<sup>{{note label|Tokyo/Wuhan|3|3}}</sup> In 2014, the [[Pan Pacific Open]] was downgraded to a Premier event and replaced by the [[Wuhan Open]].
