==Geography==
Vorpommern-Rügen – Vorpommern-Greifswald I is located in northeast [[Mecklenburg-Vorpommern]]. As of the 2021 federal election, it comprises the entirety of the Vorpommern-Rügen district, as well as the municipality of [[Greifswald]] and the [[Amt]] of [[Landhagen]] from the Vorpommern-Greifswald district.<ref name="Area"/>

==History==
Vorpommern-Rügen – Vorpommern-Greifswald I was created after German reunification in 1990, then known as ''Stralsund – Rügen – Grimmen''. Until 2002, it was constituency 267 in the numbering system. Originally, it comprised the now-abolished districts of Grimmen, [[Rügen (district)|Rügen]], and Stralsund, and the independent city of Stralsund. In the 2002 election, it was expanded to contain the former Ribnitz-Damgarten district, which had been abolished in 1994; it now covered the entirety of the later-abolished [[Nordvorpommern]] district. At this time, it was renamed to ''[[Stralsund – Nordvorpommern – Rügen (electoral district)|Stralsund – Nordvorpommern – Rügen]]'', and acquired its current constituency number of 15. In the 2013 election, it was further expanded to include the independent city of Greifswald and the Amt of Landhagen, and was renamed to Vorpommern-Rügen – Vorpommern-Greifswald I.
