There are also two separate online-only streams with one being more news-oriented, known as ''News Internet''. The service broadcasts 24 hours a day.

The current controller of BBC World Service English is [[Mary Hockaday]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/aboutthebbc/insidethebbc/managementstructure/biographies/hockaday_mary/|title=BBC - Mary Hockaday, Controller, World Service English - Inside the BBC|website=Bbc.co.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=28 July 2017}}</ref>

==History==
{{Further|Timeline of the BBC World Service}}
The BBC World Service began on 19 December 1932 as the '''BBC Empire Service''', broadcasting on [[Shortwave listening|shortwave]]<ref name="WS closures 2005 analysis">{{cite news|last= Repa|first= Jan|title= Analysis: BBC's voice in Europe|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4375652.stm|accessdate= 16 July 2012|work= BBC News|date= 25 October 2005}}</ref> and aimed principally at [[English language|English-speakers]] across the [[British Empire]]. In his first [[Royal Christmas Message#The 1932 Christmas Message|Christmas Message]] (1932), King [[George V]] characterised the service as intended for "men and women, so cut off by the snow, the desert, or the sea, that only voices out of the air can reach them".<ref name="Historic moments 30s">{{cite web|title= Historic moments from the 1930s|url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/specials/1122_75_years/page2.shtml|publisher= BBC World Service|accessdate= 16 July 2012}}</ref> First hopes for the Empire Service were low. The [[Director General of the BBC|Director General]], Sir [[John Reith, 1st Baron Reith|John Reith]] said in the opening programme:

<blockquote>Don't expect too much in the early days; for some time we shall transmit comparatively simple programmes, to give the best chance of intelligible reception and provide evidence as to the type of material most suitable for the service in each zone. The programmes will neither be very interesting nor very good.<ref name="Historic moments 30s"/><ref>Transcribed from recording on World Service 75th Anniversary DVD; full extract transmitted as part of opening program – the Reith Global Debate – of the 'Free to Speak' 75th anniversary season</ref></blockquote>

This address was read out five times as the BBC broadcast it live to different parts of the world.

On 3 January 1938 the first foreign-language service was launched—in [[Arabic language|Arabic]].  Programmes in German started on 29 March 1938, and by the end of 1942, the BBC had started broadcasts in all major European languages. As a result, the Empire Service was renamed the '''BBC Overseas Service''' in November 1939, supplemented by the addition of a dedicated BBC European Service from 1941. Funding for these services—known administratively as the '''External Services of the BBC'''—came not from the domestic [[radio licence|licence-fee]] but from government [[grant-in-aid]] (from the Foreign Office budget).{{Citation needed|date= July 2017}}
[[File:Aldwych, Bush House, WC2 - geograph.org.uk - 668798.jpg|thumb|right|[[Bush House]] in London was home to the World Service between 1941 and 2012.]]
The External Services broadcast propaganda during the Second World War of 1939–1945. Its French service ''{{lang|fr|[[Radio Londres]]}}'' also sent coded messages to the [[French Resistance]]. [[George Orwell]] broadcast many news bulletins on the '''Eastern Service''' during [[World War II]].<ref>{{Cite book|title= Orwell: The War Broadcasts|isbn= 0-563-20327-7|editor-last=West|editor-first= W. J.|year= 1985|publisher= Duckworth & Co/BBC}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Orwell: The War Commentaries|isbn=978-0-563-20349-0|editor-last=West|editor-first=W.

By the end of the 1940s the number of broadcast languages had expanded and reception had improved, following the opening of a relay in modern-day [[Malaysia]] and of the [[Limassol BBC Relay|Limassol relay]] in [[Cyprus]] in 1957. On 1 May 1965 the service took its current name of '''BBC World Service'''.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/history/story/2007/02/070122_html_60s.shtml|title= The 1960s|publisher= BBC World Service|accessdate= 25 April 2010}}</ref> It expanded its reach with the opening of the [[Telecommunications in Ascension Island|Ascension Island relay]] in 1966, serving African audiences with a stronger signal and better reception, and with the later relay on the Island of [[Masirah Island|Masirah]] in Oman.

In August 1985 the service went off-air for the first time when workers went on strike in protest at the [[British government]]'s decision to ban a documentary featuring an interview with [[Martin McGuinness]] of [[Sinn Féin]].

Subsequently, financial pressures decreased the number and the types of services offered by the BBC. Audiences in countries with wide access to [[Internet]] services have less need for terrestrial radio.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} Broadcasts in German ended in March 1999, after research showed that the majority of German listeners tuned into the English-language service. Broadcasts in [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[Finnish language|Finnish]], French, [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], Italian, Japanese and [[Malay language|Malay]] stopped for similar reasons.

On 25 October 2005, the BBC announced that broadcasts in [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], [[Croatian language|Croatian]], [[Czech language|Czech]], [[Greek language|Greek]], Hungarian, [[Kazakh language|Kazakh]], Polish, [[Slovak language|Slovak]], [[Slovene language|Slovene]] and [[Thai language|Thai]] would end by March 2006, to finance the launch in 2007 of television news-services in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and [[Persian language|Persian]].<ref name="BBC East Europe voices silenced">{{cite news|title= BBC East Europe voices silenced|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4550102.stm |accessdate= 18 July 2012|work= BBC News|date= 21 December 2005 | quote = Announcing the cuts in October, the director of the BBC World Service, Nigel Chapman, said that the European services were a beacon of free and independent information during the Cold War, but were now in decline.}}</ref> Additionally, [[Romanian language|Romanian]] broadcasts ceased on 1 August 2008.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7473778.stm |title= BBC shuts down Romanian service |author= <!--Not stated--> |date= 25 June 2008 |website= bbc.co.uk |publisher= BBC |access-date= 29 July 2017 | quote = The BBC World Service is to close its Romanian language service, after 69 years of broadcasting.<br>Transmissions in Romanian will cease on 1 August.}}</ref>

In 2011, a BBC Kyrgyz service newsreader and producer Arslan Koichiev resigned from his BBC post after revelations and claims of involvement in the [[Kyrgyz Revolution of 2010|Kyrgyzstan revolution of April 2010]].  He had been based in London, but often traveled to Kyrgyzstan and used BBC resources to agitate against President [[Kurmanbek Bakiyev]], appearing on a Kyrgyz radio station under a pseudonym with a disguised voice.  One of the leaders of the revolution, Aliyasbek Alymkulov, named the producer as his mentor and claimed that they had discussed preparations for the revolution.<ref>{{cite web|date=7 April 2011|title=BBC man quits after claims he helped to topple president in Kyrgyzstan revolt|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/bbc-man-quits-after-claims-he-helped-to-topple-president-in-kyrgyzstan-revolt-6389723.html|website=Standard.co.uk}}</ref>
According to independent news agency [[Ferghana Information Agency|Fergana News]] "Mr Alymkulov claimed that Koichiev arranged secret meetings "through the BBC" and organised the march at the presidential palace on 7 April 2010" <ref>{{cite web|date=28 April 2017|title=BBC newsreader fired following confirmation of his involvement into the April 2010 revolution in Kyrgyzstan|url=http://enews.fergananews.com/news.php?id=2081|website=Ferghana.news}}</ref>

In January 2011, the closure of the Albanian, Macedonian and Serbian, as well English for the Caribbean and Portuguese for Africa services was announced. The British government announced that the three [[Balkans|Balkan]] countries had wide access to international information, and so broadcasts in the local languages had become unnecessary.<ref>{{cite news|title= BBC World Service to cut five language services|url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-12277413|accessdate= 18 July 2012|work= BBC News|date= 26 January 2011}}</ref>  This decision reflected the financial situation the Corporation faced following transfer of responsibility for the Service from the Foreign Office, so that it would in future have been funded from within licence-fee income. The Russian, Ukrainian, Mandarin Chinese, Turkish, Vietnamese and Spanish for Cuba services ceased radio broadcasting, and the Hindi, Indonesian, Kyrgyz, Nepali, Swahili, Kinyarwanda and Kirundi services ceased shortwave transmissions. As part of the 16% budget cut, 650 jobs were eliminated.<ref name="WS cuts jan 2011">{{cite news|title= BBC World Service cuts outlined to staff|url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-12283356|accessdate= 18 July 2012|work= BBC News|date= 26 January 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last= Plunkett|first= John|title= BBC World Service to 'cut up to 650 jobs'|url= https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/jan/25/bbc-world-service-jobs|accessdate= 18 July 2012|newspaper= The Guardian|date= 26 January 2011}}</ref>

==Operation==
[[File:Broadcasting House and East Wing.jpg|thumb|right|The BBC World Service is located in [[Broadcasting House]], London.]]
The Service broadcasts from [[Broadcasting House]] in London, which is also headquarters of the corporation. It is located in the newer parts of the building, which contains radio and television studios for use by the various language services. The building also contains an integrated newsroom used by the international World Service, the international television channel [[BBC World News]], the domestic television and radio [[BBC News]] bulletins, the [[BBC News (TV channel)|BBC News Channel]] and [[BBC Online]].

At its launch, the Service was located along with most radio output in Broadcasting House. However, following the explosion of a [[parachute mine]] nearby on 8 December 1940, it relocated to premises away from the likely target of Broadcasting House.<ref name="West end at war">{{cite web|last=Thomas|first=Ronan|title=BBC Broadcasting House|url=http://www.westendatwar.org.uk/page_id__114_path__0p2p.aspx|publisher=West End at War.org.uk|accessdate=18 July 2012}}</ref> The Overseas service relocated to [[Oxford Street]] while the European service moved temporarily to the emergency broadcasting facilities at [[Maida Vale Studios]].<ref name="West end at war"/> The European services moved permanently into [[Bush House]] towards the end of 1940, completing the move in 1941, with the Overseas services joining them in 1958.<ref name="Bush House WS">{{cite web|title=Why is the HQ called Bush House?|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/institutional/2009/03/000000_bushhouse_name.shtml|work=Frequently Asked Questions|publisher=BBC World Service|accessdate=18 July 2012}}</ref> Bush House subsequently became the home of the BBC World Service and the building itself has gained a global reputation with the audience of the service.<ref name="Bush House WS"/><ref name="BBC Story Bush House">{{cite web|title=BBC Buildings – Bush House|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/historyofthebbc/collections/buildings/bush_house.shtml|work=The BBC Story|publisher=BBC|accessdate=18 July 2012}}</ref> However, the building was vacated in 2012 as a result of the Broadcasting House changes<ref name="Bush House WS"/> and the end of the building's lease that year;<ref name="Bush house move end BBC News">{{cite news|title=BBC World Service leaves Bush House|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-18810309|accessdate=18 July 2012|work=BBC News|date=12 July 2012}}</ref> the first service to move was the Burmese Service on 11 March 2012<ref>{{cite web|title=New Broadcasting House comes alive|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/broadcastinghouse/news_events.shtml|work=News and Events|publisher=BBC|accessdate=18 July 2012}}</ref> and the final broadcast from Bush House was a news bulletin broadcast at 11.00[[Greenwich Mean Time|GMT]] on 12 July 2012.<ref name="Bush house move end BBC News"/><ref>{{cite news|title=Bush House: BBC World Service moves home|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-18801251|accessdate=18 July 2012|work=BBC News|date=12 July 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Higham|first=Nick|title=BBC World Service leaves Bush House|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-18807778|accessdate=18 July 2012|work=BBC News|date=12 July 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Sabbagh|first=Dan|title=Bush House ceases BBC broadcasts after 71 years|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/jul/12/bush-house-ceases-bbc-broadcasts|accessdate=18 July 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|date=12 July 2012}}</ref>

The BBC World Service encompasses an English 24-hour global radio network and separate services in 27 other languages. News and information is available in these languages on the [[BBC Online|BBC website]], with many having [[RSS]] feeds and specific versions for use on mobile devices, and some also offer email notification of stories. In addition to the English service, 18 of the language services broadcast a radio service using the [[Shortwave radio|short wave]], [[AM broadcasting|AM]] or [[FM broadcasting|FM]] bands. These are also available to listen live or can be listened to later (usually for seven days) over the Internet and, in the case of seven language services, can be downloaded as [[podcast]]s. News is also available from the BBC News 'app', which is available from both iTunes and the Google Play Store.<ref>{{cite web|title=BBC Radio news|url=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hemant.listview&feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDEsImNvbS5oZW1hbnQubGlzdHZpZXciXQ..}}</ref> In recent years, video content has also been used by the World Service: 16 language services show video reports on the website, and the Arabic and Persian services have their own television channels.  TV is also used to broadcast the radio service, with local cable and satellite operators providing the English network (and occasionally some local language services) free to air. The English service is also available on [[digital radio]] in the UK and Europe.<ref name="in-languages">{{cite web|title=BBC News in Languages|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/languages/index.shtml|publisher=BBC|accessdate=18 July 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=How and When to Listen|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/programmeguide/|publisher=BBC World Service|accessdate=18 July 2012}}</ref>

Traditionally, the Service relied on shortwave broadcasts, because of their ability to overcome barriers of censorship, distance, and spectrum scarcity. The BBC has maintained a worldwide network of [[shortwave relay station]]s since the 1940s, mainly in former British colonies. These cross-border broadcasts have also been used in special circumstances for emergency messages to [[British subject]]s abroad, such as the advice to evacuate [[Jordan]] during the [[Black September]] incidents of September 1970. These facilities were privatised in 1997 as Merlin Communications, and later acquired and operated as part of a wider network for multiple broadcasters by [[VT Communications]] (now part of [[Babcock International Group]]). It is also common for BBC programmes to air on [[Voice of America]] or [[ORF (broadcaster)|ORF]] transmitters, while their programming is relayed by a station located inside the UK. However, since the 1980s, [[Broadcast satellite|satellite distribution]] has made it possible for local stations to relay BBC programmes.

The World Service aims to be "the world's best-known and most-respected voice in international broadcasting, thereby bringing benefit to the UK, the BBC, and to audiences around the world",<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/institutional/2009/06/090609_annual_review2009_aims.shtml|title=Annual Review 2008/2009|work=BBC News|accessdate=8 April 2010}}</ref> while retaining a "balanced British view" of international developments.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/bbctrust/assets/files/pdf/regulatory_framework/protocols/b4_bbcworldservice.txt |title=BBC protocol|website=Bbc.co.uk}}</ref> Like the rest of the BBC, the World Service is a [[Crown corporation]] of the UK Government. For the financial year 2018–19, it received £327&nbsp;million.<ref name=bbc-2019>{{cite report |url=https://downloads.bbc.co.uk/aboutthebbc/reports/annualreport/2018-19.pdf |title=Group Annual Report and Accounts 2018/19 |page=61 |publisher=BBC |year=2019 |access-date=20 February 2020}}</ref> In addition to broadcasting, the Service also devotes resources to the [[BBC Learning English]] programme.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/learningenglish/ |title=BBC Learning English |accessdate=3 October 2008 |publisher=BBC }}</ref>

==Radio programming in English==
[[File:Steve Titherington.jpg|thumb|Steve Titherington - BBC World Questions broadcasting from Budapest]]
The World Service in English mainly broadcasts news and analysis. The mainstays of the current schedule are ''[[Newsday (BBC World Service)|Newsday]]'', ''[[World Update]]'', ''[[Newshour]]'' and ''The Newsroom''. There are daily science programmes: ''Health Check'', the technology programme ''[[Click (radio programme)|Click]]'' and ''[[Science in Action – BBC World Service Radio|Science in Action]]''. At weekends, some of the schedule is taken up by ''[[Sportsworld (radio)|Sportsworld]]'', which often includes live commentary of [[Premier League]] football matches. Other weekend sport shows include ''The Sports Hour'' and [[Stumped (radio)|''Stumped'']], a cricket programme co-produced with [[All India Radio]] and the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]. On Sundays the international, interdisciplinary discussion programme ''[[The Forum (BBC World Service)|''The Forum'']]'' is broadcast. ''[[Outlook (radio programme)|Outlook]]'' is a human interest programme presented by [[Matthew Bannister]] and Jo Fidgen, which was first broadcast in July 1966 and presented for more than thirty years by [[John Tidmarsh]]. ''Trending'' describes itself as "explaining the stories the world is sharing..." Regular music programmes were reintroduced with the autumn schedule in 2015. Many programmes, particularly speech-based ones, are also available as podcasts.

==Previous radio programming in English==
{{more citations needed|section|date=December 2017}}<!--only one paragraph is cited and that's a dead link-->
Previous broadcasts included popular music programmes presented by [[John Peel]] and classical music programmes presented by [[Edward Greenfield]]. There have also been religious programmes, of mostly Anglican celebration and often from the Church of [[St. Martin in the Fields]], weekly drama, English-language lessons, and comedy including ''[[Just A Minute]]''. Other notable previous programmes include ''[[Letter from America]]'' by [[Alistair Cooke]], which was broadcast for over fifty years; ''Off the Shelf'' with its daily reading from a novel, biography or history book; ''A Jolly Good Show'', a music request programme presented by [[Dave Lee Travis]]; ''Waveguide'', a radio reception guide; and ''The Merchant Navy Programme'', a show for seafarers presented by Malcolm Billings; '''The Morning Show'', ''Good Morning Africa'' and ''PM'', all presented by [[Pete Myers (broadcaster)|Pete Myers]] in the 1960s and 1970s.

Since the late 1990s, the station has focused more on news, with bulletins added every half-hour following the outbreak of the [[Iraq War]].

===News===
News is at the core of the [[broadcast programming|scheduling]]. A five-minute bulletin is generally transmitted at 01 past the hour, with a two-minute summary at 30 past the hour. Sometimes these are separate from other programming, or alternatively made integral to the programme (such as with ''The Newsroom'', ''[[Newshour]]'' or ''[[Newsday (BBC World Service)|Newsday]]''). During such time slots as weeknights 11pm-12am GMT and that of ''Sportsworld'', no news summaries are broadcast. As part of the BBC's policy for breaking news, the Service is the first to receive a full report for foreign news.<ref name="BBC News works">{{cite web|last=Boaden|first=Helen|title=Editorial Processes – How BBC News works|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/bbctrust/assets/files/pdf/review_report_research/impartiality_business/f2_news_submission.pdf|publisher=BBC Trust|accessdate=11 August 2012|page=4|date=22 January 2007}}{{dead link|date=November 2016}}</ref>

The station also publishes a ''Global News'' podcast twice a day (once on weekends), of around 30 minutes. The podcast is comparable to an edition of ''The Newsroom'' but without the five-minute reading of the news. Between 2007 and 2015 it was downloaded more than 300&nbsp;million times.

==Availability==

===Africa===
The BBC World Service website lists more than 80 FM stations in Africa which broadcast BBC content. The BBC World Service broadcasts a few hours in the morning and evening on shortwave to Africa from Ascension Island, Mauritius, South Africa, the UK, Madagascar and the UAE. 
Broadcasts have traditionally come from the UK, Cyprus, the large BBC Atlantic Relay Station on [[Ascension Island]], and the smaller [[Lesotho]] Relay Station and Indian Ocean Relay Station on [[Seychelles]]. A large part of the English schedule is taken up by specialist programming from and for Africa, for example ''Focus on Africa'' and ''Africa, Have Your Say''. In the 1990s, the BBC added FM facilities in many African capital cities.{{fact|date=September 2020}}

===Americas===
BBC World Service is available by subscription to [[Sirius XM Holdings|Sirius XM's]] [[satellite radio]] service in the United States.<ref>{{cite press release |publisher=[[XM Satellite Radio]] |date=26 July 1999 |url=http://xmradio.mediaroom.com/index.php?s=press_releases&item=1104 |title=BBC WORLD SERVICE AND XM ANNOUNCE PROGRAMMING ALLIANCE |accessdate=17 October 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061111180733/http://xmradio.mediaroom.com/index.php?s=press_releases&item=1104 |archivedate=11 November 2006  }}</ref> Its Canadian affiliate, [[Sirius XM Canada]] does the same in Canada.

BBC World Service programming also airs as part of [[CBC Radio One]]'s ''[[CBC Radio Overnight]]'' schedule in Canada.{{fact|date=September 2020}}

BBC shortwave broadcasts to this region were traditionally enhanced by the Atlantic Relay Station and the Caribbean Relay Company, a station in [[Antigua]] run jointly with [[Deutsche Welle]]. In addition, an exchange agreement with [[Radio Canada International]] gave access to their station in [[New Brunswick]]. However, "changing listening habits" led the World Service to end shortwave radio transmission directed to North America and [[Australasia]] on 1 July 2001.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/foi/docs/annual_reports_and_reviews/annual_report_and_accounts/BBC_Annual_Reports_and_Accounts.htm#page54|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070202090014/http://www.bbc.co.uk/foi/docs/annual_reports_and_reviews/annual_report_and_accounts/BBC_Annual_Reports_and_Accounts.htm#page54|url-status=dead|title=Pages 1–136 from BBC AR Cover 03|archivedate=2 February 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/faq/news/story/2005/08/050810_nzandswpacific.shtml |title=BBC World Service &#124; FAQ |publisher=BBC |date=10 August 2005 |accessdate=16 February 2011}}</ref> A [[shortwave listening|shortwave listener]] [[coalition]] formed to oppose the change.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.savebbc.org/press/6_june_2001.html |title=Save the BBC World Service in North America and the Pacific! – BBC to Cut Off 1.2 Million Listeners on July&nbsp;1 |website=Savebbc.org |date=6 June 2001 |accessdate=16 February 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101130004805/http://savebbc.org/press/6_june_2001.html |archive-date=30 November 2010 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>

The BBC broadcasts to Central America and South America in several languages. It is possible to receive the [[West Africa|Western African]] shortwave radio broadcasts from eastern North America, but the BBC does not guarantee reception in this area.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/schedules/010119_namerica.shtml |title=FAQ &#124; World Service |publisher=BBC |accessdate=16 February 2011}}</ref> It has ended its specialist programming to the [[Falkland Islands]] but continues to provide a stream of World Service programming to the [[Falkland Islands Radio Service]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2006/02_february/23/falklands.shtml |title=Press Office – Falkland Islands and BBC to boost home-grown media |publisher=BBC |date=23 February 2006 |accessdate=16 February 2011}}</ref>

===Asia===
For several decades, the World Service's largest audiences have been in Asia, the Middle East, [[Near East]] and South Asia. Transmission facilities in the UK and Cyprus were supplemented by the former BBC Eastern Relay Station in [[Oman]] and the Far Eastern Relay Station in Singapore, formerly in Malaysia. The East Asian Relay Station moved to [[Thailand]] in 1997 when Hong Kong was [[Transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong|handed over]] to Chinese sovereignty. The relay station in Thailand was closed in January 2017; currently, relay stations in Singapore and Oman serve the Asian region. Together, these facilities have given the BBC World Service an easily accessible signal in regions where shortwave listening has traditionally been popular. The English shortwave frequencies of 6.195 (49m band), 9.74 (31m band), 15.31/15.36 (19m band) and 17.76/17.79 (16m band) were widely known. On 25 March 2018, the long-established shortwave frequency of 9.74&nbsp;MHz was changed to 9.9&nbsp;MHz.

The largest audiences are in English, [[Hindi]], [[Urdu]], [[Nepali language|Nepali]], [[Bengali language|Bengali]], [[Sinhala language|Sinhala]], [[Tamil language|Tamil]], [[Marathi language|Marathi]] and other major languages of South Asia, where BBC broadcasters are household names. The [[Persian language|Persian]] service is the ''de facto'' national broadcaster of [[Afghanistan]], along with its Iranian audience. The World Service is available up to eighteen hours a day in English across most parts of Asia, and in Arabic for the Middle East. With the addition of relays in Afghanistan and Iraq these services are accessible in most of the Middle and Near East in the evening. In Singapore, the BBC World Service in English is essentially treated as a domestic broadcaster, easily available 24/7 through long-term agreement with [[Mediacorp#Radio|MediaCorp Radio]]. For many years [[Radio Television Hong Kong]] broadcast BBC World Service 24/7 but as of 4 September 2017 only broadcasts the station at night. In the [[Philippines]], [[DZRJ-AM|DZRJ 810 AM]] broadcasts the BBC World Service in English from 12:00–05:00 [[Philippine Standard Time|PHT]] ([[GMT+8]]).

Although this region has seen the launch of the only two foreign language television channels, several other services have had their radio services closed as a result of budget cuts and redirection of resources.<ref>{{cite news|title= BBC Thai service ends broadcasts| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4609860.stm | author = Clare Harkey | date = 13 March 2006 | accessdate =8 November 2008 | work=BBC News}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-12864041 |title=BBC Chinese Service makes final broadcast in Mandarin |author=Vivien Marsh |publisher=BBC |date=28 March 2011 |accessdate=25 October 2011}}</ref>

Japan and Korea have little tradition of World Service listening, although during the 1970s to 1980s, shortwave listening was popular in Japan. In those two countries, the BBC World Service was only available via shortwave and the Internet. As of September 2007, a satellite transmission (subscription required) became available by Skylife (Channel 791) in South Korea. In November 2016, the BBC World Service announced it plans to start broadcasts in Korean. ''BBC Korean'', a radio and web service, started on 25 September 2017.<ref name=38north-20170926>{{cite web |url=http://www.38north.org/2017/09/mwilliams092617/ |title=Option for North Korean Radio Listeners |last=Williams |first=Martyn |publisher=U.S.-Korea Institute, Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies |work=38 North |date=26 September 2017 |accessdate=28 September 2017}}</ref>

===Europe===
The BBC World Service is broadcast in Berlin on 94.8&nbsp;MHz. FM relays are also available in Ceske Budjovice, Karlovy Vary, Plzen, Usti nad Labem, Zlin and Prague in the Czech Republic, Pristina, Riga, Tallinn, Tirana and Vilnius. A BBC World Service channel is available on [[DAB+]] in Brussels and Flanders and Amsterdam, the Hague, Utrecht and Rotterdam. Following a national reorganisation of DAB multiplexes in October 2017, the station is available on DAB+ across the whole of [[Denmark]].<ref>{{cite web|title=BBC World Service joins new Danish DAB+ network|url=http://www.a516digital.com/2017/10/bbc-world-service-joins-new-danish-dab.html|accessdate=2 October 2017}}</ref>

The World Service employed a [[Orfordness transmitting station|medium wave transmitter]] at [[Orford Ness]] to provide English-language coverage to Europe, including on the [[frequency]] 648 [[kHz]] (which could be heard in parts of the south-east of England during the day and most of the UK after dark). Transmissions on this frequency were stopped on 27 March 2011, as a consequence of the budgetary constraints imposed on the BBC World Service in the 2010 budget review.<ref>{{cite web|title=BBC World Service: The closure of 648 kHz medium wave|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/institutional/2011/02/110208_648khz_mw_closure.shtml|publisher=BBC|accessdate=11 August 2012}}</ref> A second channel (1296&nbsp;kHz) traditionally broadcast in various Central European languages, but this frequency has also been discontinued and in 2005 it began regular English-language transmissions via the [[Digital Radio Mondiale]] (DRM) format.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/faq/news/story/2005/09/050907_drm_launch_release.shtml| title=BBC Launches DRM Service in Europe|publisher=BBC World Service|date=7 September 2005|accessdate=15 November 2006}}</ref> This is a digital shortwave technology that VT expects to become the standard for cross-border transmissions in developed countries. The BBC World Service still goes out from the BBC Radio 4 LW and MW transmitters from 01:00am to 05:20am UK Time and is in stereo from 01:00am to 05:20am on BBC Radio 4 FM and DAB. It has always been in mono on its own DAB channel with a bit rate of just 64 kbit/s. BBC World Service can also be heard on BBC Radio Wales from 01:00am until 05:30am on MW and FM stereo.

In the 1990s, the BBC purchased and constructed large medium wave and FM networks in the former Soviet bloc, particularly the Czech (BBC Czech Section), Slovak Republics (BBC Slovak Section), Poland ([[BBC Polish Section]]) (where it was a national network) and Russia ([[BBC Russian Service]]). It had built up a strong audience during the Cold War, whilst economic restructuring made it difficult for these governments to refuse Western investment. Many of these facilities have now returned to domestic control, as economic and political conditions have changed.

On Monday, 18 February 2008, the BBC World Service stopped analogue shortwave transmissions to Europe. The notice stated, "Increasing numbers of people around the world are choosing to listen to radio on a range of other platforms including FM, satellite and online, with fewer listening on shortwave."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/5nCxH0NlsPtyW8WvJ0rwDJP/about-world-service-radio|title=BBC - About World Service radio|website=BBC}}</ref> It is sometimes possible to pick up the BBC World Service in Europe on SW frequencies targeted at North Africa. The BBC's powerful 198&nbsp;kHz LW, which broadcasts the domestic [[BBC Radio 4]] to Britain during the day (and carries the World Service during the night) can also be heard in nearby parts of Europe, including the Republic of Ireland, the Netherlands, Belgium and parts of France, Germany and Scandinavia.

In Malta, BBC News bulletins are carried by a number of radio stations, including Radju Malta and Magic 91.7, owned by national broadcaster PBS Ltd. These are broadcast at various points in the day and supplement news bulletins broadcast in Maltese from the PBS Newsroom.

Former BBC shortwave transmitters are located in the United Kingdom at [[Rampisham]], [[Woofferton transmitting station|Woofferton]] and [[Skelton transmitter|Skelton]]. The former [[British East Mediterranean Relay Station|BBC East Mediterranean Relay Station]] is in [[Cyprus]].

===Pacific===
The World Service is available as part of the [[subscription]] Digital Air package (available from [[Foxtel]] and [[Austar]]) in Australia. [[ABC NewsRadio]], [[SBS Radio]], and various [[community radio]] stations also broadcast many programmes. Many of these stations broadcast a straight feed during the midnight to dawn period. It is also available via the [[satellite service]] [[Optus Aurora]], which is encrypted but available without subscription. In Sydney, Australia, a transmission of the service can be received at 152.025&nbsp;MHz. It is also available on the [[Digital radio in Australia|DAB+ Network in Australia]] on [[SBS Radio]] 4 (except during [[Eurovision Song Contest|Eurovision]] and special events). 2MBS-FM 102.5, a classical music station in Sydney, also carries the BBC World Service news programmes at 7a.m. and 8a.m. on weekdays, during its ''Music for a New Day'' breakfast programme.

Shortwave relays from Singapore (see Asia, above) continue, but historic relays via [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC)]] and [[Radio New Zealand International]] were wound down in the late 1990s. BBC World Service relays on [[Radio Australia]] now carry the BBC Radio news programmes.

{{anchor|Auckland Radio Trust}}In the Pacific and New Zealand, the Auckland Radio Trust operates a BBC World Service network as a non-profit donation-funded public broadcaster.<ref name=aucklandfriends>{{cite web|title=Friends|url=http://worldservice.co.nz/Friends.php|website=worldservice.co.nz|publisher=Auckland Radio Trust|accessdate=23 January 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160128182515/http://worldservice.co.nz/Friends.php|archive-date=28 January 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> It broadcasts on 810&nbsp;kHz in [[Auckland]], 107.0&nbsp;MHz in [[Whitianga]] and [[Whangamata]], 107.3&nbsp;MHz in [[Kaipara Harbour]], 88.2&nbsp;MHz in [[Suva]] and [[Nadi]], 100.0&nbsp;MHz in [[Bairiki]] and [[Tarawa]], 101.1&nbsp;MHz in [[Pohnpei]], 107.6&nbsp;MHz in [[Port Moresby]], 105.9&nbsp;MHz in [[Honiara]], 99.0&nbsp;MHz in [[Port Vila]] and [[Luganville]], and 100.1&nbsp;MHz in [[Funafuti]].<ref name=aucklandhomepage>{{cite web|title=Home Page|url=http://worldservice.co.nz/Home_Page.php|website=worldservice.co.nz|publisher=Auckland Radio Trust|accessdate=23 January 2016}}</ref> The station also broadcasts local content.

In New Zealand, [[Radio Tarana]] and members of the [[Association of Community Access Broadcasters]] carry some BBC World Service programmes. The BBC World Service was previously available on 1233&nbsp;kHz in Wellington between 1990 and 1994, and again from 1996 to 1997.

===UK===
The BBC World Service is broadcast on [[Digital Audio Broadcasting|DAB]], [[Freeview (UK)|Freeview]], [[Virgin Media]] and [[Sky UK|Sky]] platforms. It is also broadcast overnight on the frequencies of [[BBC Radio 4]] following the latter's closedown at 0100 British time. The BBC World Service does not receive funding for broadcasts to the UK. In southeast England, the station could be picked up reliably on medium wave 648&nbsp;kHz, which was targeted at mainland Europe. The medium wave service was closed in 2011 as a cost-cutting measure.

==Presentation==
[[File:BBC World Service Top of Hour.ogg|thumb|A previous BBC World Service signature tune and an example of a top-of-the-hour announcement.]]
The World Service uses several tunes and sounds to represent the station. A previous signature tune of the station was a five note motif, composed by [[David Arnold]] and which comprises a variety of voices declaim "This is the BBC in..." before going on to name various cities (e.g. [[Kampala]], Milan, [[Delhi]], [[Johannesburg]]), followed by the station's slogan and the [[Greenwich Time Signal]].<ref name=signature>{{cite web|title= What is the BBC World Service signature tune?| url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/institutional/2009/03/000000_ws_sig_tune.shtml | publisher = BBC | accessdate =4 September 2010}}</ref><ref name=music>{{cite web | title = Audio Identities | url = http://imagedissectors.com/article/46 | author = Robert Weedon | date = 16 December 2009 | accessdate = 4 September 2010 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100922192529/http://www.imagedissectors.com/article/46 | archive-date = 22 September 2010 | url-status=dead }}</ref> This was heard throughout the network with a few variations – in the UK the full service name was spoken, whereas just the name of the BBC was used outside the UK. The phrase "This is London" was used previously in place of a station slogan.

The tune "[[Lillibullero]]" was another well known signature tune of the network following its broadcast previously as part of the top-of-the-hour sequence.<ref name=music/> This piece of music is no longer heard before news bulletins.<ref name=signature/> The use of the tune gained minor controversy because of its background as a [[Protestant]] marching song in [[Northern Ireland]].<ref name=signature/><ref name=music/>

The ''[[Prince of Denmark's March]]'' (commonly known as the ''Trumpet Voluntary'') was often broadcast by the BBC Radio during [[World War II]], especially when programming was directed to [[occupied Denmark]], as the march symbolised a connection between the two countries. It remained for many years the signature tune of the BBC European Service.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.orbem.co.uk/grams/grams_5.htm |title = BBC Station Idents and Interval Signals}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.intervalsignals.net/countries/uk-bbcws.htm |title = Interval Signals Online - United Kingdom (BBC World Service)}}</ref>

[[File:BBC World Service Big Ben 1-1-2009.ogg|thumb|left|The BBC World Service announcement and time signal at midnight GMT, 1 January 2009]]
In addition to these tunes, the BBC World Service also uses several [[interval signal]]s. The English service uses a recording of [[Bow Bells]], made in 1926 and used a symbol of hope during the [[Second World War]], only replaced for a brief time during the 1970s with the tune to the nursery rhyme "[[Oranges and Lemons]]". The morse code of the letter "[[V]]" has also been used as a signal and was introduced in January 1941 and had several variations including [[timpani]], the first four notes of [[Symphony No. 5 (Beethoven)|Beethoven's Fifth Symphony]] (which coincide with the letter "V"), and electronic tones which until recently remained in use for some Western European services. In other languages, the interval signal is three notes, pitched B–B-C. However, these symbols have been used less frequently.

The network operates using [[GMT]], regardless of the time zone and time of year, and is announced on the hour on the English service as "13 hours [[Greenwich Mean Time]]" (1300 GMT) or "Midnight Greenwich Mean Time" (0000 GMT). The BBC World Service traditionally broadcasts the chimes of [[Big Ben]] in London at the start of a new year.
