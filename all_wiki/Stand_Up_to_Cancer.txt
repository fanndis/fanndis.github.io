'''Stand Up To Cancer''' ('''SU2C''') is a charitable program of the [[Entertainment Industry Foundation]] (EIF). SU2C aims to raise significant funds for translational cancer research through online and televised efforts. Central to the program is a telethon that was first televised by four major broadcast networks ([[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], [[NBC]], [[CBS]], [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]) in over 170 countries on September 5, 2008. SU2C raised over $100 million after that evening's broadcast.<ref name="usatoday30.usatoday.com">{{cite web|last=Keveney |first=Bill |url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/people/2008-09-05-cancer-telethon_N.htm |title=Stars 'Stand Up to Cancer,' raise $100M - USATODAY.com |publisher=Usatoday30.usatoday.com |date=2008-09-08 |accessdate=2015-07-26}}</ref> Funds collected by Stand Up To Cancer are then distributed by the [[American Association for Cancer Research]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Gorman, [[Registered nurse|R.N.]]|first1=Ali|title=Telethon helping locals stand up to cancer|url=http://6abc.com/health/telethon-helping-locals-stand-up-to-cancer-/1505279/|accessdate=10 September 2016|agency=[[WPVI-TV]]|date=9 September 2016}}</ref>

== History ==
Stand Up To Cancer was conceived of in autumn 2007, by a group of women who had been affected by cancer and believe that by merging the recourse of the media and entertainment industries into a single operation they would be able to fight against this disease in a more profound way.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.standup2cancer.org/faq |title=Stand Up To Cancer — FAQ |publisher=Standup2cancer.org |date=2008-05-27 |accessdate=2015-07-26}}</ref>

Stand Up To Cancer was formally launched on May 27, 2008. Current members of the SU2C Council of Founders and Advisors (CFA) include [[Katie Couric]], [[Sherry Lansing]], Kathleen Lobb, Lisa Paulsen, Rusty Robertson, Sue Schwartz, Pamela Oas Williams, and Ellen Ziffren.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.standup2cancer.org/su2c_leadership |title=Stand Up To Cancer — SU2C Leadership |publisher=Standup2cancer.org |date= |accessdate=2015-07-26}}</ref> All current members of the CFA were co-producers of the 2012 televised special. The late co-founder [[Laura Ziskin]] executive produced both the September 5, 2008 and September 10, 2010 broadcasts. Sung Poblete, Ph.D., R.N., has served as SU2C’s president and CEO since 2011. In the United Kingdom, [[Channel 4]], along with [[Cancer Research UK]], launched its own version of ''[[Stand Up to Cancer (UK)|Stand Up To Cancer]]'' in October 2012, which has continued every year since.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://su2c.channel4.com/|title=Stand Up To Cancer|work=[[Channel 4]]|accessdate=26 September 2012}}</ref>

== Initiative ==
Stand Up To Cancer aims to raise awareness and bring about an understanding that everyone is connected to cancer. The statistic used most often by SU2C is from the [[American Cancer Society]]: one out of every two men and one out of every three women will be diagnosed with cancer in their lifetime,<ref name=acscf>[http://www.cancer.org/docroot/STT/content/STT_1x_Cancer_Facts_and_Figures_2008.asp?from=fast ACS Cancer Facts and Figures 2008]. Retrieved on 27 May 2008.</ref> meaning everyone is affected in some way, or will be.

The campaign has featured televised moments during [[World Series]] baseball games where fans literally "stand up to cancer" by rising and holding signs inscribed with the names of friends and loved ones who have struggled with the disease.<ref>{{cite web|title=MLB stands up to cancer during Game 4 of Series|url=http://m.mlb.com/news/article/63396062/|publisher=Major League Baseball|accessdate=17 October 2014}}</ref>

== Research teams funded==
SU2C has donated hundreds of millions of dollars since the first "Dream Team" was organized in 2009. The "Dream Teams" funded by SU2C brings researchers together from institutions and universities across the world and have been among the most productive collaborations in getting new drugs to market and many teams are funded jointly with other cancer research organizations. The research is required to be [[translational]] and include laboratory and clinical members and cannot involve more than one principal investigator from each institution.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20120717023829/http://www.standup2cancer.org/the_su2c_research_model ]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.aacr.org:443/Funding/PAGES/SUTC-LISTING.ASPX|title=Stand Up To Cancer Dream Teams|website=www.aacr.org}}</ref> Many of these dream teams are co-sponsored by other cancer-related foundations.
