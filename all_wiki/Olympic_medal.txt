An '''Olympic medal''' is awarded to successful competitors at one of the [[Olympic Games]]. There are three classes of [[medal]]: [[gold medal|gold]], awarded to the winner; [[silver medal|silver]], awarded to the  runner-up; and [[bronze medal|bronze]], awarded to the third place.  The granting of [[award]]s is laid out in detail in the Olympic protocols.

Medal designs have varied considerably since the first Olympic Games in 1896, particularly in size and weight.  A standard obverse (front) design of the medals for the [[Summer Olympic Games]] began with the [[1928 Summer Olympics|1928 Games]] and remained for many years, until its replacement at the [[2004 Summer Olympics|2004 Games]] in [[Athens]] as the result of controversy surrounding the use of the Roman [[Colosseum]] rather than a building representing the Games' [[Greece|Greek]] roots.  The medals of the [[Winter Olympic Games]] never had a common design, but regularly feature snowflakes and the event where the medal has been won.

In addition to generally supporting their Olympic athletes, some countries provide sums of money and gifts to medal winners, depending on the classes and number of medals won.

Total medals won are used to rank competitor nations in medal tables, these may be compiled for a specific discipline, for a particular Games, or [[All-time Olympic Games medal table|over all time]]. These totals always total event placements rather than actual medals—a victory in a team event (such as [[relay race]]) equates to a single gold for such rankings even though each team member would receive a physical medal.

==Introduction and early history==
The [[olive wreath]] was the prize for the winner at the [[Ancient Olympic Games]]. It was an [[olive]] branch, off the [[Olea oleaster|wild-olive tree]] that grew at [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]],<ref>[[Theophrastus]], ''Enquiry into Plants'', IV.13.2: 'the wild-olive [''kotinos''] at Olympia near the temple of zeus, from which the wreaths for the games are made".</ref> intertwined to form a circle or a horse-shoe. According to [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] it was introduced by [[Heracles]] as a prize for the winner of the [[Stadion (running race)|running race]] to honour [[Zeus]].<ref>[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], Description of Greece, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Paus.+5.7.7&fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0160 5.7.7]</ref>

When the modern Olympic Games began in 1896 medals started to be given to successful olympian competitors.  However, [[gold medal]]s were not awarded at the [[1896 Summer Olympics|inaugural Olympics in 1896]] in [[Athens]], [[Greece]].<ref name="bbc">[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-14291544#summer-1928 London 2012: Olympic medals timeline], [[BBC News]]. Retrieved 27 July 2011.</ref>  The winners were instead given a [[silver medal]] and an [[olive]] branch,<ref name="official report">{{cite book |last=De Coubertin |first=Pierre |author2=Timoleon J.

In: ''The Olympic Games B.C. 776.&nbsp;— A. D. 1896''. Part II</ref> In 1900, most winners received cups or trophies instead of medals.

The custom of the sequence of [[gold]], [[silver]], and [[bronze]] for the first three places dates from the [[1904 Summer Olympics]] in [[St. Louis, Missouri]] in the [[United States]].  The [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC) has retroactively assigned gold, silver and bronze medals to the three best placed athletes in each event of the 1896 and [[1900 Summer Olympics|1900]] Games.<ref>{{cite web | title = Athens 1896–Medal Table | publisher = International Olympic Committee | url = http://www.olympic.org/uk/games/past/table_uk.asp?OLGT=1&OLGY=1896 | access-date = 2008-05-05 }}</ref><ref name="Mallon">{{cite book | author = Mallon, Bill | year = 1998 | title = The 1900 Olympic Games, Results for All Competitors in All Events, with Commentary | publisher = McFarland & Company, Inc., Publishers | location = Jefferson, North Carolina | isbn = 0-7864-0378-0 | url-access = registration | url = https://archive.org/details/1900olympicgames00mall }}</ref>  If there is a tie for any of the top three places all competitors are entitled to receive the appropriate medal according to IOC rules.<ref name="rep268">[http://www.olympic.org/Documents/Reports/EN/en_report_268.pdf Report 268].

Medals are not the only awards given to competitors; every athlete placed first to eighth receives an [[Olympic diploma]].  Also, at the main host stadium, the names of all medal winners are written onto a wall.<ref name="rep268" />  Finally, as noted below, all athletes receive a participation medal and diploma.

The IOC dictates the physical properties of the medals and has the final decision about the finished design.  Specifications for the medals are developed along with the [[National Olympic Committee]] (NOC) hosting the Games, though the IOC has brought in some set rules:<ref name="rep268" /><ref name="ArtVictory">[http://www.powerhousemuseum.com/sydney2000games/files/modules/63BF7DF2-4224-4A35-AF03B3B732AEEAF2/olympic_victory_medals.pdf The fine art of victory], [[Powerhouse Museum]].

*Event details: The sport for which the medal has been awarded should be written on the medal

The first Olympic medals in 1896 were designed by French sculptor [[Jules-Clément Chaplain]] and depicted [[Zeus]] holding [[Nike (mythology)|Nike]], the [[Greek mythology|Greek goddess]] of victory, on the obverse and the [[Acropolis]] on the reverse.<ref name="bbc" />  They were made by the [[Paris Mint]], which also made the medals for the 1900 Olympic Games, hosted by Paris.  This started the tradition of giving the responsibility of [[Mint (coin)|minting]] the medals to the host city.  For the next few Olympiads the host city also chose the medal design. Until 1912 the gold medals were made of solid gold.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/olympics-2016-gold-medals/story?id=41318405 |title=Olympics 2016: Everything You Need to Know About Gold Medals |website=ABC News |date=12 August 2016 |access-date= 14 August 2016}}</ref>

===''Trionfo''===
[[File:1980 Summer Olympics bronze medal.JPG|thumb|The [[bronze medal]] from the [[1980 Summer Olympics]] showing Cassioli's obverse design portraying [[Nike (mythology)|Nike]], the Greek goddess of victory]]

In 1923 the [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC) launched a competition for sculptors to design the medals for the [[Summer Olympic Games]].  [[Giuseppe Cassioli]]'s ''[[Trionfo]]'' design was chosen as the winner in 1928.<ref name="bbc" /><ref name="olympicorg">[http://www.olympic.org/content/museum/museum-treasures/winners-medals/medal_london_1948/ Winner's medal for the 1948 Olympic Games in London], Olympic.org. Retrieved 5 August 2011.</ref><ref name="aig">[http://www.athensinfoguide.com/olympicmedalssummer.htm Olympic Summer Games Medals], Athens Info Guide. Retrieved 27 July 2011.</ref>  The obverse brought back Nike but this time as the main focus, holding a winner's crown and palm with a depiction of the [[Colosseum]] in the background.<ref name="olympicorg" />  In the top right section of the medal a space was left for the name of the Olympic host and the Games numeral.  The reverse features a crowd of people carrying a triumphant athlete.  His winning design was first presented at the [[1928 Summer Olympics]] in [[Amsterdam]].  The competition saw this design used for 40 years until the [[1972 Summer Olympics]] in [[Munich]] became the first Games with a different design for the reverse side of the medal.<ref name="bbc" />

Cassioli's design continued to inspire the obverse of the medal for many more years, though recreated each time, with the Olympic host and numeral updated.  The obverse remained true to the ''Trionfo'' design until the [[1992 Summer Olympics]] in [[Barcelona]], [[Spain]], where the IOC allowed an updated version to be created.  For the next few events they mandated the use of the Nike motif but allowed other aspects to change.<ref name="ArtVictory" />

The trend ended after 2000, due to the negative reaction to the medal design for the [[2000 Summer Olympics]] in [[Sydney]]. The designer of the 2000 medal ([[Wojciech Pietranik]]) had originally featured the [[Sydney Opera House]] on the obverse instead of the traditional [[Rome|Roman]] [[Colosseum]] but the [[International Olympic Committee]] decided that the Colosseum should remain.<ref name="ArtVictory2">[http://www.powerhousemuseum.com/sydney2000games/files/modules/63BF7DF2-4224-4A35-AF03B3B732AEEAF2/olympic_victory_medals.pdf The fine art of victory], [[Powerhouse Museum]]. Accessed 11 September 2011.</ref> The [[Greece|Greek]] press criticised the design for ignorance of the birthplace of the Olympic Games, pointing out that the long-standing feature on the front of medals was mistakenly depicting the Roman Colosseum rather than the Greek [[Parthenon]].<ref name="bbc" /><ref name="Telegraph">[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/greece/1367176/Greek-anger-at-Olympic-medal-design.html Greek anger at Olympic medal design], ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]''. Retrieved 5 August 2011.</ref> The Sydney Organising Committee decided to continue with the design as it was, noting that there was insufficient time to complete another version and that it would be too costly.<ref name="ArtVictory" /> This long-standing error had remained for 76 years until a new style depicting the [[Panathenaic Stadium]] was introduced at the [[2004 Summer Olympics]] in [[Athens]].<ref name="peopledaily">[http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/200307/02/eng20030702_119258.shtml Athens' New Olympic Medal Design Win IOC's Nod], People Daily. Retrieved 5 August 2011.</ref> This new obverse design remains in use.

===Custom reverse designs===
The German Olympic Committee, [[Nationales Olympisches Komitee für Deutschland]], were the first Summer Games organisers to elect to change the reverse of the medal.  The 1972 design was created by [[Gerhard Marcks]], an artist from the [[Bauhaus]], and features mythological twins [[Castor and Pollux]].<ref name="IOCrefdoc">[http://www.olympic.org/Documents/Reference_documents_Factsheets/Summer_Games_Medals_ENG.pdf Olympic Summer Games Medals From Athens 1896 to Beijing 2008]. International Olympic Committee. April 2010. Retrieved 10 September 2011.</ref>  Since then the Organising Committee of the host city has been given the freedom of the design of the reverse, with the IOC giving final approval.

===Comparison between Summer and Winter===
The IOC has the final decision on the specifications of each design for all Olympic medals, including the Summer Games, [[Winter Olympic Games|Winter Games]], and [[Paralympic Games]].  There has been a greater variety of design for the Winter Games; unlike with the Summer Games, the IOC never mandated one particular design.  The medal at the inaugural [[1924 Winter Olympics]] in [[Chamonix]], [[France]] did not even feature the [[Olympic symbols#Olympic rings|Olympic rings]].  Nike was featured on the medals of the 1932 and 1936 Games but has only appeared on one medal design since then.  One regular motif is the use of the snowflake, while laurel leaves and crowns appear on several designs.  The Olympic motto ''[[Olympic symbols#Motto|Citius, Altius, Fortius]]'' features on four Winter Games medals but does not appear on any Summer Games medal.

For three events in a row, hosts of the Winter Games included different materials in the medals: glass (1992), [[sparagmite]] (1994), and [[lacquer]] (1998).  It was not until the [[2008 Summer Olympics]] in [[Beijing]], [[China]] that a Summer Olympic host chose to use something different, in this case [[jade]].  While every Summer Olympic medal except for the 1900 Games has been circular, the shapes of the Winter Games have been considerably more varied.  The Winter Games medals are also generally larger, thicker, and heavier than those for the Summer Games.

==Participation medals==

Since the beginning of the modern Olympics the athletes and their support staffs, event officials, and certain volunteers involved in planning and managing the games have received commemorative medals and diplomas.  Like the winners' medals, these are changed for each Olympiad, with different ones issued for the summer and winter games.<ref>[http://www.olympic-museum.de/index.html Olympic Museum]</ref>

==Presentation==
[[File:Thorpe gold medal.jpg|thumb|[[Jim Thorpe]] receives his medal at the [[1912 Summer Olympics]]]]
The presentation of the medals and awards changed significantly until the [[1932 Summer Olympics]] in [[Los Angeles]] brought in what has now become standard.  Before 1932 all the medals were awarded at the closing ceremony, with the athletes wearing [[white tie|evening dress]] for the first few Games.  Originally the presenting dignitary was stationary while the athletes filed past to receive their medals.  The victory [[podium]] was introduced upon the personal instruction in 1931 of [[Henri de Baillet-Latour]], who had seen one used at the [[1930 British Empire Games]].<ref name="podium1998">{{cite paper |last=Barney|first=Robert K. |title=A Research Note on the Origins of the Olympic Victory Podium |journal=International Symposium for Olympic Research |volume=Fourth: Global and Cultural Critique: Problematizing the Olympic Games |pages=219–226 |format=PDF |url=http://library.la84.org/SportsLibrary/ISOR/ISOR1998x.pdf |year=1998 |access-date=12 September 2013}}</ref> The winner is in the middle at a higher elevation, with the silver medallist to the right and the bronze to the left.<ref name="podium1998"/>  At the [[1932 Winter Olympics]], medals were awarded in the closing ceremony, with athletes for each event in turn mounting the first-ever podium.  At the Summer Olympics, competitors in the [[Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum|Coliseum]] received their medals immediately after each event for the first time; competitors at other venues came to the Coliseum next day to receive their medals.<ref name="rep268" /><ref name="podium1998"/> Later Games have had a victory podium at each competition venue.

The [[1960 Summer Olympics]] in [[Rome]], [[Italy]] were the first in which the medals were placed around the neck of the athletes.  The medals hung from a chain of laurel leaves, while they are now hung from a coloured ribbon.<ref name="IOCrefdoc" />  When Athens hosted the 2004 Summer Olympics the competitors on the podium also received an olive wreath crown. In the [[2016 Summer Olympics]] in [[Rio de Janeiro]], each medalist received a wooden statuette of the Olympic logo.<ref>http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-08-17/rio-2016-what-is-the-figurine-athletes-are-receiving-with-medal/7749814</ref>
