The '''''Toronto Star''''' is a Canadian [[broadsheet]] [[daily newspaper]]<!--Please don't add political affiliation; its affiliation is already stated in the infobox-->. As of 2015, it was Canada's [[list of newspapers in Canada by circulation|highest-circulation newspaper]] in overall weekly circulation:<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/toronto-star |title=Toronto Star |encyclopedia=[[The Canadian Encyclopedia]] |date=July 21, 2009}}</ref> although a close second to ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' in daily circulation on weekdays, it overtakes the ''Globe'' in weekly circulation because the ''Globe'' does not publish a Sunday edition.<ref>[http://newspaperscanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/2015-Daily-Newspaper-Circulation-Report-REPORT_FINAL.pdf "Circulation Report: Daily Newspapers 2015"].

==History==
[[Image:Horatio Clarence Hocken.png|thumb|left|[[Horatio Clarence Hocken]], founder of the ''Star''<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://lop.parl.ca/sites/ParlInfo/default/en_CA/People/Profile?personId=2177#comp |title=Archived copy |access-date=February 15, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180814235123/https://lop.parl.ca/sites/ParlInfo/default/en_CA/People/Profile?personId=2177#comp#comp |archive-date=August 14, 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref>]]

===Formation===
The ''Star'' (originally known as the '''''Evening Star''''' and then the '''''Toronto Daily Star''''') was created in 1892<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/The-Toronto-Star |title=The Toronto Star &#124; Canadian newspaper |encyclopedia=Britannica.com |accessdate=February 15, 2019}}</ref> by striking ''[[Toronto News]]'' printers and writers, led by future [[Mayor of Toronto]] and social reformer [[Horatio Clarence Hocken]], who became the newspaper's founder,<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://lop.parl.ca/sites/ParlInfo/default/en_CA/People/Profile?personId=2177 |title=Profile – Hocken, Horatio Clarence |publisher=Parliament of Canada |work=Parlinfo |access-date=February 15, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190711195922/https://lop.parl.ca/sites/ParlInfo/default/en_CA/People/Profile?personId=2177 |archive-date=July 11, 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref> along with another future mayor, [[James Simpson (politician)|Jimmy Simpson]].

The ''Star'' was first printed on ''[[The Toronto World|Toronto World]]'' presses, and at its formation, ''The World'' owned a 51% interest in it{{sfn|Archer|1947|p=3}} as a [[wikt:silent partner|silent partner]].{{sfn|Sotiron|2005}} That arrangement only lasted for two months, during which time it was rumoured that [[William Findlay Maclean|William Findlay "Billy" Maclean]], ''The World''{{'}}s proprietor, was considering selling the ''Star'' to the Riordon family.{{efn|owners of the Riordon Pulp and Paper Company, and investors in ''[[The Hamilton Spectator]]'', ''Toronto Mail'' and the ''[[Toronto Evening News]]''.{{sfn|Rutherford|1982}}}} After an extensive fundraising campaign among the ''Star'' staff, Maclean agreed to sell his interest to Hocken.{{sfn|Sotiron|2005}}{{sfn|Archer|1947|pp=4{{en dash}}5}}

The paper did poorly in its first few years. Hocken sold out within the year, and several owners followed in succession until railway entrepreneur [[William Mackenzie (railway entrepreneur)|William Mackenzie]] bought it in 1896.{{sfn|Archer|1947|pp=5{{en dash}}6}} Its new editors, [[Edmund E. Sheppard]] and [[Frederic Thomas Nicholls]], moved the entire ''Star'' operation into the same building used by the magazine ''[[Saturday Night (magazine)|Saturday Night]]''.{{sfn|Archer|1947|p=6}} This would continue until [[Joseph E. Atkinson|Joseph E. "Holy Joe" Atkinson]], backed by funds raised by supporters of Prime Minister [[Wilfrid Laurier]], bought the paper.{{sfn|Archer|1947|p=6}} The supporters included [[George Albertus Cox|Senator George Cox]], [[William Mulock]], [[Peter Charles Larkin]] and [[Timothy Eaton]].<ref>{{Cite DCB |last=Otto |first=Stephen A. |title=Larkin, Peter Charles |volume=15 |url=http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/larkin_peter_charles_15E.html}}</ref>

===Atkinson's influence===
[[Image:Joseph Edward Atkinson.jpg|thumb|right|[[Joseph E. Atkinson]], c. 1910s]]
Atkinson was the ''Star''{{'}}s editor from 1899 until his death in 1948.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/about/history-of-the-toronto-star.html|title=History of the Toronto Star|date=September 23, 2016|website=thestar.com|language=en|access-date=February 29, 2020}}</ref> The newspaper's early opposition and criticism of the [[Nazi Party|Nazi regime]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://vhec.org/1936_olympics/the_nazi_state/a_canadian_observer |title=A Canadian Observer |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |publisher=Vancouver Holocaust Education Centre}}</ref> saw it become one of the first North American papers to be [[Censorship in Nazi Germany|banned in Germany]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.thestar.com/anniversary/2017/11/01/125-years-of-speaking-out.html |title=125 years of speaking out |last=Phillips |first=Andrew |date=November 1, 2017 |work=Toronto Star |access-date=January 23, 2018}}</ref>

Atkinson had a social conscience. He championed many causes that would come to be associated with the modern [[welfare state]]: [[old age pension]]s, [[Unemployment benefits|unemployment insurance]], and [[health care]]. The [[Government of Canada]] Digital Collections website describes Atkinson as<blockquote>a "radical" in the best sense of that term.... The ''Star'' was unique among North American newspapers in its consistent, ongoing advocacy of the interests of ordinary people. The friendship of Atkinson, the publisher, with [[William Lyon Mackenzie King|Mackenzie King]], the [[Prime Minister of Canada|prime minister]], was a major influence on the development of Canadian social policy.<ref>[http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/ Bienvenue au site Web Bibliothèque et Archives Canada / Welcome to the Library and Archives Canada website]. Collectionscanada.gc.ca (August 30, 2012). Retrieved on August 17, 2013.{{Dead link |date=May 2016}}</ref></blockquote>

Atkinson became the controlling [[shareholder]] of the ''Star''.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wR_-aSFyvuYC&q=joseph+e+atkinson+controlling+shareholder+of+the+star&pg=PA2368|title=The Canadian Encyclopedia|page=2368|author=James H. Marsh|year=1999|isbn=9780771020995|accessdate=July 10, 2020}}</ref> The ''Star'' was frequently criticized for practising the [[yellow journalism]] of its era. For decades, the paper included heavy doses of crime and sensationalism, along with advocating social change. From 1910 to 1973, the ''Star'' published a weekend supplement, the ''[[Star Weekly]]''.

Shortly before his death in 1948, Joseph E. Atkinson transferred ownership of the paper to a charitable organization given the mandate of continuing the paper's liberal tradition.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Powell |first=Betsy |title=Atkinson's will kept Star's resolve |accessdate=January 12, 2011 |date=November 6, 2002 |url=https://www.thestar.com/article/542589--atkinson-s-will-kept-star-s-resolve |location=Toronto |newspaper=Toronto Star |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121023065908/http://www.thestar.com/article/542589--atkinson-s-will-kept-star-s-resolve |archivedate=October 23, 2012}}</ref> In 1949, the Province of Ontario passed the ''Charitable Gifts Act'',{{efn|The {{Cite canlaw |short title=Charitable Gifts Act |abbr=R.S.O. |year=1990 |chapter=C.8 |link=https://www.ontario.ca/laws/statute/90c08}}, repealed in 2009 by the {{Cite canlaw |short title=Good Government Act, 2009 |abbr=S.O. |year=2009 |chapter=33 |schedule=2 |link=https://www.ontario.ca/laws/statute/s09033}}}} barring charitable organizations from owning large parts of profit-making businesses,<ref>{{cite web |last=Bourgeois |first=Donald |title=The Charitable Gifts Act: A Commentary |accessdate=January 12, 2011 |url=http://www.carters.ca/pub/bulletin/charity/2009/chylb174.htm}}</ref> that effectively required the ''Star'' to be sold.{{efn|But the Act's repeal in 2009 does not mean that charities in Ontario can now set up for-profit companies or pursue business activities.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.millerthomson.com/assets/files/newsletter_attachments/issues/Charities_and_Not-For-Profit_December_2009.pdf |title=Ontario Government passes ''Good Government Act'' that includes positive changes for charities |last1=Lazier |first1=Kate |last2=Manwaring |first2=Susan M. |date=December 2009 |publisher=[[Miller Thomson]]}}</ref>}}

Atkinson's will had directed that profits from the paper's operations were "for the promotion and maintenance of social, scientific and economic reforms which are charitable in nature, for the benefit of the people of the province of Ontario" and it stipulated that the paper could be sold only to people who shared his social views.<ref>{{cite news |last=Martin |first=Sandra |date=November 8, 2005 |title=Beland Honderich, 86 |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/beland-honderich-86/article1130520/?page=all |newspaper=[[The Globe and Mail]]}}</ref> The five trustees of the charitable organization circumvented the Act by buying the paper themselves and swearing before the [[Supreme Court of Ontario]] to continue what became known as the "Atkinson Principles":<ref>{{cite web |title=Atkinson Principles |url=http://www.torstar.com/html/social-responsibility/Atkinson_Principles/index.cfm |publisher=[[Torstar]] |accessdate=August 2, 2013}}</ref>
* A strong, united and independent Canada
* Social justice
* Individual and civil liberties
* Community and civic engagement
* The rights of working people
* The necessary role of government

Descendants of the original owners, known as "the five families",{{efn|being the Atkinson, Hindmarsh, Campbell, Honderich and Thall families}} still control the voting shares of [[Torstar]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.torstar.com/images/file/Information%20Circular/2016%20Info%20Circular.pdf |title=Information Circular |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=March 1, 2016 |publisher=[[Torstar]] |pages=3{{en dash}}5}}</ref> and the Atkinson Principles continue to guide the paper to this day. In February 2006, ''Star'' media columnist [[Antonia Zerbisias]] wrote on her blog:

<blockquote>Besides, we are the ''Star'' which means we all have the Atkinson Principles—and its multi-culti values—tattooed on our butts. Fine with me. At least we are upfront about our values, and they almost always work in favour of building a better Canada.<ref>{{cite web |first=Antonia |last=Zerbisias |author-link=Antonia Zerbisias |title=Kartoon Kontroversy Kontinues |url=http://thestar.blogs.com/azerb/2006/02/kartoon_kontrov.html |date=February 20, 2006 |accessdate=August 2, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060323061555/http://thestar.blogs.com/azerb/2006/02/kartoon_kontrov.html |archivedate=March 23, 2006}}</ref></blockquote>

===Involvement with broadcasting===

From 1922 to 1933, the ''Star'' was also a radio broadcaster on its station [[CFCA (AM)|CFCA]], broadcasting on a [[wavelength]] of 400 [[metre]]s (749.48&nbsp;kHz), whose coverage was complementary to the paper's reporting.<ref name="Plummer2014">{{cite web |url=http://torontoist.com/2014/03/historicist-an-invisible-giant/ |title=Historicist: An Invisible Giant |last1=Plummer |first1=Kevin |date=March 22, 2014 |website=torontoist.com}}</ref> The station was closed following the establishment of the [[Canadian Radio Broadcasting Commission]] (CRBC) and the introduction of a government policy that, in essence, restricted private stations to an [[effective radiated power]] of 100 [[watt]]s.<ref name="Plummer2014" /> The ''Star'' would continue to supply sponsored content to the CRBC's CRCT station—which later became CBC station [[CBLA-FM|CBL]]—an arrangement that lasted until 1946.<ref name="Plummer2014" />

===1970s to present===
In 1971, the newspaper was renamed the ''Toronto Star'' and moved to a modern International-Style office tower at [[One Yonge Street]] by [[Queens Quay (Toronto)|Queens Quay]]. The original [[Old Toronto Star Building|''Star'' building]] at 80 King Street West was demolished to make room for [[First Canadian Place]]. The new building originally housed the paper's presses. In 1992, the printing plant was moved to the [[Toronto Star Press Centre]] at the [[Ontario Highway 407|Highway 407]] & [[Ontario Highway 400|400]] interchange in [[Vaughan]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2012/09/06/torstars_vaughan_press_centre_celebrates_20th_anniversary.html|title=Torstar's Vaughan Press Centre celebrates 20th anniversary|work=Toronto Star}}</ref> In September 2002, the logo was changed, and "The" was dropped from the papers. During the [[Northeast blackout of 2003|2003 Northeast blackout]], the ''Star'' printed the paper at a press in [[Welland]], [[Ontario]].

Until the mid-2000s, the front page of the ''Toronto Star'' had no third-party advertising aside from upcoming lottery jackpot estimates from the [[Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corporation]] (OLG).

On May 28, 2007, the ''Star'' unveiled a redesigned paper that features larger type, narrower pages, fewer and shorter articles, renamed sections, more prominence to local news, and less so to international news, columnists, and opinion pieces.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2007/05/28/you_spoke_we_listened_here_are_the_changes.html |work=Toronto Star |location=Toronto |title=You spoke, we listened: Here are the changes |date=May 28, 2007 |accessdate=May 25, 2010 |first=J. Fred |last=Kuntz}}</ref> However, on January 1, 2009, the ''Star'' reverted to its previous format. ''Star P.M.'', a free newspaper in [[PDF]] format that could be downloaded from the newspaper's website each weekday afternoon, was discontinued in October 2007, thirteen months after its launch.

On January 15, 2016, Torstar confirmed the closure of its Vaughan printing presses and that it will outsource printing to [[Transcontinental (company)|Transcontinental Printing]], leading to the layoff of all 285 staff at the plant as Transcontinental has its own existing facility, also in Vaughan.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://toronto.citynews.ca/2016/01/15/torstar-sell-vaughan-printing-plant-close-300-jobs-affected/|title=Torstar to sell printing plant in Vaughan, close to 300 jobs affected|website=toronto.citynews.ca}}</ref>

In April 2018, the ''Toronto Star'' expanded its local coverage of Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton and Halifax with rebranded daily newspapers, previously known as ''Metro'', as ''[[StarMetro (newspaper)|StarMetro]]'', which was a joint venture between Torstar (90%) and Swedish media company [[Metro International]] (10%).<ref>{{cite web |title=Torstar hiring 20 reporters as it rebrands and revamps Metro Urban dailies across Canada |url=https://business.financialpost.com/telecom/media/torstar-hiring-20-reporters-as-it-rebrands-and-revamps-metro-urban-dailies |website=Financial Post |publisher=The Canadian Press}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Healing |first1=Dan |title=StarMetro?

In October 2018, the ''Toronto Star'' acquired [[iPolitics]], a political news outlet.<ref>{{cite web |title=Tortar signs agreement to purchase political website iPolitics |url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/torstar-buys-ipolitics-1.4831392 |website=CBC |accessdate=March 30, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Torstar to purchase iPolitics media outlet |url=https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/torstar-to-purchase-ipolitics-media-outlet-693842521.html |website=Cision |accessdate=March 30, 2019}}</ref>

On December 20, 2019, all ''StarMetro'' editions ceased publication amid the popularity and resultant growth of news apps on mobile devices.<ref>{{cite web |title=Torstar shutting down StarMetro papers across Canada |url=https://toronto.citynews.ca/2019/11/19/torstar-shutting-down-starmetro-papers-across-canada/ |website=CityNews |publisher=Rogers Digital Media. |date=November 19, 2019 |accessdate=December 27, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Toronto Star shutting down StarMetro newspapers |url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/toronto-star-star-metro-closing-1.5365326 |website=CBC.ca |publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. |date=November 19, 2019 |accessdate=December 27, 2019}}</ref>

==The ''Star'' brand==

===Editorial position===
Like its competitor ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', the ''Star'' covers "a spectrum of opinion that is best described as urban and [[Central Canada|Central Canadian]]" in character. The ''Star'' is generally centrist and [[centre-left]], and is more [[Social liberalism|socially liberal]] than ''The Globe and Mail''.<ref name="Winter">Elke Winter, ''Us, Them and Others: Pluralism and National Identities in Diverse Societies'' (University of Toronto Press, 2011), p. 96.</ref> The paper has aligned itself over the years with the progressive "Atkinson principles" named for publisher [[Joseph E. Atkinson]],<ref name="Wallace">Kenyon Wallace, [https://www.thestar.com/trust/2018/05/24/how-the-star-is-making-its-political-endorsements-more-transparent.html How the Star is making its political endorsements more transparent], ''Toronto Star' (May 26, 2018).</ref> who was editor and publisher of the paper for 50 years.<ref name="Harris">Tamar Harris, [https://www.thestar.com/anniversary/2017/11/04/through-constant-change-atkinson-principles-endure.html Through constant change, Atkinson Principles endure], ''Toronto Star'' (November 4, 2017).</ref> These principles included [[social justice]] and [[social welfare provision]], as well as [[individual rights]] and [[civil liberties]].<ref name="Harris" /> In 1984, scholar Wilfred H. Kesterton described the ''Star'' as "perpetually indignant" because of its social consciousness.<ref name="Winter" /> When Atkinson's son Joseph Story Atkinson became president of the ''Star'' in 1957, he said, "From its inception in 1892, the Star has been a champion of social and economic reform, a defender of minority rights, a foe of discrimination, a friend of organized labour and a staunch advocate of Canadian nationhood."<ref name="Harris" />

Another of the "Atkinson principles" has been a "strong, united and independent Canada"; in a 1927 editorial, the paper wrote, "We believe in the British connection as much as anybody does but on a self-respecting basis of equality, of citizenship, and not on the old basis of one country belonging to the other."<ref name="Harris" /> The paper was historically wary of American influence,<ref name="Harris" /> and during the debates over the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]], the paper was frequently critical of [[free trade]] and expressed concerns about Canadian sovereignty.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Andrea M.L. |last=Perrella |title=Editorials and the Free Trade Agenda: Comparison of Law Press and the Toronto Star Quebec Under Free Trade: Making Public Policy in North America |journal=Quebec Under Free Trade: Making Public Policy in North America |editor=Guy Lachapelle |publisher=Presses de l'Université du Québec |date=1995 |pages=276–79}}</ref> The paper has been traditionally supportive of [[Official bilingualism in Canada|official bilingualism]] and maintaining Canadian unity in opposition to [[Quebec sovereignty movement|Quebec separatism]].<ref name="Harris" />

In the 1980s, [[Michael Farber]] wrote in the ''[[Montreal Gazette]]'' that the ''Star''{{'}}s coverage was Toronto-centric to the point that any story was said to carry an explanation as to "What it means to [[Metropolitan Toronto|Metro]]."<ref>{{cite news |last=Farber |first=Michael |date=August 27, 1985 |title=Stock deal ends talk of takeover |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1946&dat=19850827&id=haIkAAAAIBAJ&pg=2529,3244467&hl=en |newspaper=[[Montreal Gazette]] |page=A-3}}</ref> Conversely, Canadian sociologist Elke Winter wrote in 2011 that the ''Toronto Star'' was less "Toronto-centric" than its rival, ''The Globe and Mail'', writing that the ''Star'' "consciously reports for and from Canada's most multicultural city" and catered to a diverse readership.<ref name="Winter" />

====Election endorsements====
In the 50 years to 1972, the ''Star'' endorsed the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal Party]] in each [[List of Canadian federal general elections|federal general election]].<ref name="English">Kathy English, [https://www.thestar.com/news/politics/federalelection/2008/10/11/why_do_newspapers_endorse.html Why do newspapers endorse?], ''Toronto Star'' (October 11, 2008).</ref> In the fifteen federal elections between 1968 and 2019, the ''Star'' has endorsed the Liberal Party eleven times, the [[New Democratic Party]] twice, and the [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada|Progressive Conservative Party]] twice.<ref name="Wallace" />

Elections in which the ''Star'' did not endorse the Liberals took place in [[1972 Canadian federal election|1972]] and [[1974 Canadian federal election|1974]] (when it endorsed the Progressive Conservatives), and [[1979 Canadian federal election|1979]] and [[2011 Canadian federal election|2011]] (when it endorsed the NDP).<ref name="English" /><ref name="Wallace" /> In the 2011 election, the ''Star'' [[Newspaper endorsements in the 2011 Canadian federal election|endorsed the NDP]] under [[Jack Layton]],<ref name="2011endorsement">{{cite news |url=https://www.thestar.com/opinion/editorials/article/983376--toronto-star-endorses-the-ndp |title=Toronto Star endorses the NDP |work=Toronto Star |date=April 30, 2011 |accessdate=May 1, 2011}}</ref> but to avoid [[vote splitting]] that could inadvertently help the Conservatives under [[Stephen Harper]], which it saw as the worst outcome for the country, the paper also recommended Canadians [[Tactical voting|vote strategically]] by voting for "the progressive candidate best placed to win" in certain ridings.<ref name="strategicvoting">{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/opinion/editorialopinion/2011/04/30/but_vote_strategically.html|title=But vote strategically|work=Toronto Star|date=April 30, 2011|url-status=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140321014354/https://www.thestar.com/opinion/editorialopinion/2011/04/30/but_vote_strategically.html|archivedate=March 21, 2014}}</ref> For the [[2015 Canadian federal election|2015 election]], the ''Star'' endorsed the Liberal Party under [[Justin Trudeau]],<ref name="2015endorsement">{{cite news |url=https://www.thestar.com/opinion/editorials/2015/10/09/for-justin-trudeau-and-the-liberal-party-editorial.html |title=Toronto Star endorses Liberal leader Justin Trudeau for prime minister |work=Toronto Star|date=October 9, 2015}}</ref> and did so again in the [[2019 Canadian federal election|2019 federal election]].<ref name="2019endorsement">{{cite news |url=https://www.thestar.com/opinion/editorials/2019/10/16/liberals-are-the-best-choice-for-canada.html |title=Liberals are the best choice for Canada |work=Toronto Star|date=October 16, 2019}}</ref>

The ''Star'' is one of the few Canadian newspapers that employs a "[[public editor]]" ([[ombudsman]]) and was the first to do so. Its newsroom policy and journalistic standards guide is also published online.<ref>[https://www.thestar.com/opinion/publiceditor/article/1098344 Toronto Star Newsroom Policy and Journalistic Standards Guide | Toronto Star]. Thestar.com (December 7, 2011). Retrieved on August 17, 2013.</ref>

Other notable features include:
* optional supplements on Saturday and Sunday include Starweek (television listings and episode summaries), abridged version of ''[[The New York Times]]'' international section, ''New York Times'' Crosswords, editorials, and book reviews). Starweek and ''The New York Times'' supplements require separate additional payment)

The ''Star'' states that it favours an inclusive, "[[big tent]]" approach, not wishing to attract one group of readers at the expense of others. It publishes special sections for [[Chinese New Year]] and [[Pride Week (Toronto)|Gay Pride Week]], along with regular features on real estate (including condominiums), individual neighbourhoods (and street name etymologies), shopping, cooking, dining, alcoholic beverages (right down to having an exclusive on the anti-competitive practices of [[the Beer Store]] that led to major reforms on the [[Liquor Licence Act (Ontario)|sale of alcohol in Ontario]] grocery stores in 2015 by Premier [[Kathleen Wynne]] and [[W. Edmund Clark|Ed Clark]]), automobiles (as Wheels), and travel destinations.

Since the mid-2010s, the sports and business sections are consolidated on some days and eventually, all weekdays.
