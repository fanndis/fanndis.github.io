==History==
After the breakup of his band [[DeYarmond Edison]], the ending of a relationship, and a bout with [[Infectious mononucleosis|mononucleosis hepatitis]],<ref name=Frere>{{cite magazine|last=Frere |first=Sasha |url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2009/01/12/into-the-woods-pop-music-sasha-frere-jones |title=Into the Woods |magazine=[[The New Yorker]] |date=January 7, 2009 |accessdate=August 29, 2011}}</ref> Vernon left [[Raleigh, North Carolina|Raleigh]], North Carolina, and moved back to Wisconsin. He spent the oncoming winter months at his father's cabin in [[Dunn County, Wisconsin]]. According to Vernon, it was during this time that the "Bon Iver" moniker first entered his mind; while bedridden with mononucleosis, he began watching the 1990s TV series ''[[Northern Exposure]]'' on DVD. One episode depicts a group of citizens in Alaska, where the show is set, emerging from their homes into the first snowfall of the winter and wishing one another ''bon hiver'' ({{IPA-fr|bɔn‿ivɛːʁ|pron}}, French for "good winter"). This was initially transcribed by Vernon as "boniverre"; however, when he learned of its proper French spelling, he elected not to use it, deciding "''hiver''" reminded him too much of ''[[liver]]'', the site of his illness at the time.<ref name=Frere/>

===2006–2010: ''For Emma, Forever Ago''===
{{Main|For Emma, Forever Ago}}
Vernon did not intend to write or record any music during the time but rather to recuperate from the events of the previous year. Eventually, however, a record began to evolve during this cathartic time of isolation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ambledown.com/boniver_bio.html |title=Amble Down Records Bio |publisher=Ambledown.com |accessdate=August 29, 2011}}</ref> He had recently finished helping the band [[The Rosebuds]] do some recording and had with him some basic recording gear when he made his move to the cabin in late 2006. Vernon played all the instruments during recording and each song was heavily edited with a large number of overdubs. Vernon wrote the lyrics for the album by recording a word-less melody and listening to the recording over and over while writing words according to the sound of the syllables of the melody.<ref name=treble>{{cite web |url=http://www.treblezine.com/features/143.html |first=Dustin |last=Allen |title=Out of the Bungalow: An Interview With Bon Iver |publisher=Treblezine.com |date=February 11, 2008 |accessdate=August 29, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927184242/http://www.treblezine.com/features/143.html |archive-date=September 27, 2011 }}</ref> In an interview, Vernon said, "Words like 'decision' and 'intention' aren't words that float in my head because I just went." Vernon explains, "I left North Carolina and went up there because I didn't know where else to go and I knew that I wanted to be alone and I knew that I wanted to be where it was cold."<ref name=Whibbs>{{cite web |last1=Whibbs |first1=Chris |url=http://exclaim.ca/articles/multiarticlesub.aspx?csid1=119&csid2=4&fid1=29854 |title=Bon Iver's Good Winter |website=[[Exclaim!]] |date=March 2008 |access-date=April 12, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091005051227/http://exclaim.ca/articles/multiarticlesub.aspx?csid2=4&fid1=29854&csid1=119 |archive-date=October 5, 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In another interview, Vernon describes what he used to record the album: "I had a very light set-up, a basic small recording set-up: a [[Shure SM57]] and an old [[Silvertone (brand)|Silvertone guitar]]. I had my brother drop off his old drums... some other small things—things I would make or find lying around."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thankscaptainobvious.net/2007/11/interview-bon-iver/ |title=Interview: Bon Iver |date=November 18, 2007 |accessdate=February 14, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426055246/http://www.thankscaptainobvious.net/2007/11/interview-bon-iver/ |archive-date=April 26, 2012 }}</ref>
[[File:Bon Iver2.jpg|thumb|Vernon performing with Bon Iver in [[Shepherds Bush Empire|Shepherd's Bush]], London, UK in 2008]]

The record was almost not released and was originally intended as a group of demos to be sent out to labels and potentially rerecorded. But after getting very encouraging reactions from a number of his friends, Vernon decided to release the songs himself in their present state.<ref name=treble/> According to his manager Kyle Frenette, an initial run of 500 CDs were pressed.<ref name=hitquarters>{{cite web |url=http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview/2011/July25_11_36_47.html |title=Interview with Kyle Frenette |publisher=[[HitQuarters]] |date=July 25, 2011 |accessdate=July 28, 2011 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6ATMIgHqP?url=http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview%2F2011%2FJuly25_11_36_47.html |archive-date=September 6, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The original CD release show took place at the House of Rock in [[Eau Claire, Wisconsin]]. Justin played an earlier "all-ages" show and an evening 21+ show to release the original pressing of the album in its [[card stock]] CD case. Of the 500 copies issued, 17 were sent to press, mainly blogs.<ref name=hitquarters/> The first significant attention the album received was from My Old Kentucky Blog in June 2007, after which point "it snowballed," according to manager Frenette.<ref name=hitquarters/> Another further breakthrough came when, in October 2007, the album received a very positive review from influential indie internet publication [[Pitchfork (website)|''Pitchfork'']]. That exposure in turn led to a performance the same month at the industry showcase festival [[CMJ Music Marathon]]. The appearance attracted much label interest and Frenette later told [[HitQuarters]] that they subsequently spoke to various record companies, both independent and major.<ref name=hitquarters/> Out of all of them they decided to sign with the indie [[Jagjaguwar]] because their ideals most resembled their own.<ref name=hitquarters/> The signing was confirmed on October 29, 2007.<ref name=muzzleofbees>{{cite web |url=http://www.muzzleofbees.com/2007/10/29/bon-iver-signs-to-jagjaguwar-plays-mob-showcase/ |title=Bon Iver signs to Jagjaguwar, plays MoB showcase |publisher= muzzleofbees.com |date=October 29, 2007 |accessdate=July 28, 2011}}</ref>

===2011–2012: ''Bon Iver''===
{{Main|Bon Iver (album)}}
''Bon Iver'' was released on June 17, 2011. On March 23, 2011, [[Justin Vernon]] told ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' that a follow-up of ''For Emma, Forever Ago'' would be released in December 2011. The album is composed of 10 songs and takes a new musical direction: "I brought in a lot of people to change my voice — not my singing voice, but my role as the author of this band, this project," says Vernon, who hired well-known players like [[Bass saxophone|bass saxophonist]] [[Colin Stetson]] and pedal-steel guitarist [[Greg Leisz]]. "I built the record myself, but I allowed those people to come in and change the scene." The second album is described as an "ambitious musical departure" from the first.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://frontpsych.com/2011/06/09/good-winter-great-summer-a-review-of-bon-iver/ |title=Good Winter, Great Summer – A Review of Bon Iver |publisher=Frontier Psychiatrist |first=Keith |last=Meatto |date=June 9, 2011 |accessdate=August 29, 2011}}</ref> Prior to the album's release, Vernon said that each song on the new album represents a place. The song "Perth" was described as a "Civil War-sounding heavy metal song," the song "Minnesota, WI" was described as featuring "finger-picked guitars, double bass drums and distorted bass saxophone," and the closing song "[[Beth/Rest]]" would be "horn heavy."<ref name=Serpick>{{cite magazine|first1=Evan |last1=Serpick |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/why-bon-iver-had-to-relearn-everything-he-knows-20110323/ |title=Why Bon Iver Had to Relearn Everything He Knows |magazine=Rolling Stone |date=March 23, 2011 |accessdate=February 13, 2012}}</ref>

The album was recorded in a remodeled veterinarian clinic in Fall Creek, Wisconsin, which was bought by Vernon and his brother in 2008. It was converted into April Base Studios, built mainly over the defunct swimming pool attached to the clinic. Vernon's reason for recording in the location was that "[it's] been a wonderful freedom, working in a place we built. It's also only three miles from the house I grew up in, and just ten minutes from the bar where my parents met."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jagjaguwar.com/onesheet.php?cat=JAG135 |title=Bon Iver – Bon Iver |first1=Michael |last1=Perry |publisher=Jagjaguwar |date=June 21, 2011 |accessdate=August 29, 2011}}</ref>

In an interview on [[KCMP|89.3 The Current]], front man Justin Vernon was questioned about current plans for the band and expressed their desire to take a break:
{{quotation| [We're] winding it down. I look at it like a faucet. I have to turn it off and walk away from it because so much of how that music comes together is subconscious or discovering. There's so much attention on the band, it can be distracting at times. I really feel the need to walk away from it while I still care about it. And then if I come back to it—if at all—I'll feel better about it and be renewed or something to do that.<ref>{{cite interview |url=http://blog.thecurrent.org/post/2012/09/justin-vernon-talks-david-campbell-about-eau-claire-and-success-bon-iver |interviewer=David Campbell |title=Justin Vernon talks to David Campbell about Eau Claire and the success of Bon Iver |publisher=KCMP 89.3 |location=Minneapolis-St. Paul |date=September 23, 2012 |accessdate=January 6, 2013}}</ref>}}

During the last performance of their 2012 tour in [[Dublin]]'s [[3Arena|The O2]], Vernon announced that it was their last performance as a band, "... at least for a while..." At the time, these two events provoked speculation about whether this was a definite end to the band or simply a hiatus. A representative for Bon Iver's label, [[Jagjaguwar]], issued the statement, "They are just going off cycle after two very busy years on this record."<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://pitchfork.com/news/47962-justin-vernon-bon-iver-winding-down/ |title=Justin Vernon: Bon Iver "Winding Down" |first=Larry |last=Fitzmaurice |publisher=[[Pitchfork Media]] |date=September 24, 2012 |accessdate=November 22, 2012}}</ref>

Josh Jackson reviewed ''Bon Iver'' for ''[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]]'', saying, "It retains the beautiful melancholy of For Emma, but in nearly every way, it's just more. More layered, more diverse, more interesting. He brings in collaborators to do what they do best, but never at the expense of his sound and vision. It treads into new sonic directions without getting lost." He gave the album a score of nine out of ten.<ref>[https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2011/06/bon-iver]{{dead link|date=August 2011}}</ref> In an unfavorable review, Tim Sendra of [[AllMusic]] wrote, "[Vernon's] style comes off more like sub-Enya with a beard than a true studio wizard...

In late August 2011, critically acclaimed English [[post-dubstep]] musician and singer-songwriter [[James Blake (musician)|James Blake]] uploaded a track called "[[Fall Creek Boys Choir]]" to his YouTube channel. The track was a collaboration with Bon Iver.

On June 30, 2014, the band released a new song titled ''Heavenly Father'', which was featured on the soundtrack of [[Zach Braff]]'s film ''[[Wish I Was Here]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/news/55749-hear-a-new-bon-iver-song-heavenly-father/ |title=Hear a New Bon Iver Song, "Heavenly Father" |publisher=[[Pitchfork Media]] |date=June 30, 2014 }}</ref> Bon Iver's song ''Woods'' was featured in the [[Bluecoats]] 2015 program ''Kinetic Noise'', which was awarded a bronze medal at the [[Drum Corps International]] World Championships.{{cn|date=August 2020}} On July 18, 2015, the band played their first show in almost three years at the Eaux Claires Music Festival in [[Eau Claire, Wisconsin|Eau Claire, WI]] where they debuted two new songs, "666 ʇ" and "89". Originally, both were slated to be on their next album, but only "666 ʇ" made it to the finished record. Unreleased track "89" has been played occasionally since, soon becoming a fan favorite.<ref>{{cite web|last=Bartenstein|first=Ben|title=Bon Iver makes triumphant homecoming at Eaux Claires festival|url=http://www.twincities.com/localnews/ci_28507950/bon-iver-makes-triumphant-homecoming-at-eaux-claires|website=Twincities.com|publisher=Pioneer Press|accessdate=July 20, 2015}}</ref> On November 18, 2015, the band announced a tour of Asia starting early 2016.{{cn|date=August 2020}}

On July 22, 2016, a 22-second live stream was broadcast on the band's official Facebook page, accompanied by the caption '#22days'. A short clip of previously unreleased music can be heard in the video, accompanied by an updated profile and cover photo. On August 17, 2016, the band announced that their next album's title would be ''[[22, A Million]]''. They also provided a track list of 10 songs and released lyric videos for two songs: "22 (OVER S∞∞N)" and "10 dEATh bREasT". On August 29, 2016, the band released their lyric video for "33 "GOD"", the third single from the album.

''22, A Million'' was indeed released on September 30, 2016. It was noted by many as a large stylistic shift for the band. One aspect of this shift included a drastic change in instrumentation; on ''22, A Million'' and subsequent releases, Bon Iver often collaborated with a group of saxophonists known as [[Sad Sax of Shit]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Thompson |first1=Paul |title=Bon Iver Debut New Album in Concert: Live Blog |url=https://pitchfork.com/news/67499-bon-iver-debut-new-album-in-concert-live-blog/ |website=Pitchfork |accessdate=18 November 2020}}</ref>In [[Pitchfork (website)|''Pitchfork'']]'s review of the album, the publication likened it to [[Radiohead]]'s ''[[Kid A]]'', saying, "Bon Iver's first album in five years takes an unexpected turn toward the strange and experimental.

===2018–present: ''Come Through'' shows and ''I, I''===
{{Main|I, I}}
In mid 2018, Bon Iver partnered with TU Dance for ''Come Through'', a series of shows featuring a group of contemporary dancers and during which several new songs were premiered. In late 2018, during an Instagram Live session, frontman Justin Vernon revealed a folder named "BI LP4", containing 13 new songs. He also revealed a snippet of the song "We Maddie Parry" (later shortened to "We").

==Live performances==
In live performances, [[Justin Vernon]] is joined live by [[S. Carey|Sean Carey]] (drums, vocals, piano), Michael Noyce (vocals, baritone guitar, guitar, violin) and Matthew McCaughan (bass, drums, vocals). Noyce was Vernon's guitar student during high school.<ref name="Pitchfork Mason-Campbell"/> Vernon uses various keyboard instruments during live performances including synthesisers such as a Dave Smith Instruments Prophet 6 and a Teenage Engineering's OP-1, while during studio recordings his instruments have included a Steinway & Sons Model D Concert Grand Piano.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://equipboard.com/pros/justin-vernon|title=Justin Vernon Equipboard|website=Equipboard|access-date=April 27, 2019}}</ref>

Carey approached Vernon during one of the first Bon Iver shows, telling him he could play and sing all the songs. Thereafter, the two played a number of them together.<ref name=pitchfork>[http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/feature/49814-interview-bon-iver] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080921061045/http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/feature/49814-interview-bon-iver |date=September 21, 2008 }}</ref> McCaughan and Vernon met while on tour with [[indie-rock]] band [[The Rosebuds]] in May 2007.

[[File:Flickr - moses namkung - Bon Iver 5.jpg|thumb|From left to right: Noyce, Carey, and Vernon performing at [[The Fillmore]] in 2009]]
Because of the extensive use of vocal harmony on the songs of ''For Emma, Forever Ago'', Vernon was concerned that there would not be enough voices to duplicate the sound of the songs on the album in a live setting. To compensate for this problem in early performances, Vernon passed out lyrics for some songs to the audience to sing along to. In an interview with [[Pitchfork (website)|''Pitchfork'']], Vernon described this dilemma. "I don't want to be the guy with an acoustic guitar singing songs, because that's boring for the most part. The song actually needs 80–500 people singing or whatever the vibe is of that room, it needs that fight."<ref name="Pitchfork Mason-Campbell"/>

Bon Iver performed at [[Lollapalooza]] 2009. Bon Iver has also performed at [[Austin City Limits Music Festival]], [[Glastonbury Festival 2009|Glastonbury]], [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival|Coachella]], [[Øyafestivalen]], [[Way Out West Festival|Way Out West]], [[Bonnaroo Music and Arts Festival|Bonnaroo]], [[Sasquatch! Music Festival|Sasquatch!]] and [[All Points East]] among others.

After the release of Bon Iver's second album, the live performances underwent a great deal of change. With older performances consisting of Vernon playing guitar, while Noyce, Carey, and McCaughan varied instruments, the concerts following ''[[Bon Iver (album)|Bon Iver]]'' involved a much larger, full band. The new lineup consisted of the original four musicians, and included [[Rob Moose]] on violin and guitar ([[Antony and the Johnsons]], [[The National (band)|The National]]), Mike Lewis on bass ([[Andrew Bird]], [[Happy Apple]]), and a horn section including Reginald Pace, [[Colin Stetson]] ([[Tom Waits]], [[Arcade Fire]]) and C.J. Camerieri ([[Rufus Wainwright]], [[Sufjan Stevens]]) as well.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} On February 2, 2012 [[Sasquatch! Music Festival|Sasquatch!]] announced Bon Iver as a headliner for their 2012 festival.

During Bon Iver's Asia tour in late February to early March 2016—the first tour since 2012—the live band still consisted of Vernon, Carey, McCaughan and Lewis, in addition to frequent Vernon collaborator Andrew Fitzpatrick (All Tiny Creatures, [[Volcano Choir]]) on guitar, synths and vocals; and sisters Emily, Jessica and Camilla Staveley-Taylor, also known as the folk vocal trio [[The Staves]], whose album ''If I Was'' was produced by Vernon.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BCIsK1LrvBT |title=Instagram |publisher=[[Instagram]] |date=February 23, 2016 |accessdate=September 30, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/thestaves/status/696757686113730560 |title=The Staves on Twitter: "Melmon & Agent Cooper are thrilled to announce that The Staves will be playing IN @boniver on their Asia tour.

==Mini-documentary==
'''''Bon Iver: Autumn''''' is a 12-minute film directed by [[Andrew Swant]], documenting the preparation for Bon Iver's 2019 North American tour to support their fourth album ''[[i,i]]''. The film focuses on Justin Vernon discussing the production of the upcoming live shows, the desire to maintain an intimate feeling despite the fact that they will be playing in larger, arena-sized venues. It previews the motion-tracking technology used in the light show, and the immersive three-dimensional sound design planning.
