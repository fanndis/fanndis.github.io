'''Combermere School''' is a school in [[Barbados]]. It was initially established in 1695 as the Drax Parish School by the 1682 will of Colonel Henry Drax (great-uncle of the Whig politician [[Henry Drax]]). The school underwent several name changes and relocations until it settled at Waterford, [[Saint Michael, Barbados|St. Michael]], on the outskirts of [[Bridgetown]], [[Barbados]], with the present site dating to 1819. The school, named after Lord Combermere, bears tribute to some of the school forefathers through the naming of various areas such as the Drax Square, the De Vere Moore Gardens, and the Major Noot Hall.
 
Combermere has a very diverse and well-qualified teaching staff including over 30+ teachers and one guidance counsellor. Most hold bachelor's degrees in their subject area, with at least three holding doctorates. The school offers a music program and the band has won awards at the National Independence Festival for the Creative Arts (NIFCA). It is also home to the Number 3 Cadet Company.
