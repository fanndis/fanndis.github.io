'''Scranton''' is the sixth-largest city in the [[Pennsylvania|Commonwealth of Pennsylvania]]. It is the [[county seat]] and largest city of [[Lackawanna County, Pennsylvania|Lackawanna County]] in [[Northeastern Pennsylvania]]'s [[Wyoming Valley]] and hosts a [[United States federal courts|federal court]] building for the [[United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania]]. With an estimated population in 2019 of 76,653, it is the largest city in [[northeastern Pennsylvania]] and the [[Scranton–Wilkes-Barre–Hazleton, PA Metropolitan Statistical Area]], which has a population of about 570,000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usa.com/scranton-wilkes-barre-pa-area.htm |title=Scranton, Wilkes, Barre Metro Area |publisher=Usa.com |accessdate=2015-10-26}}</ref> The city is conventionally divided into nine districts: North Scranton, Southside, Westside, the Hill Section, Central City, Minooka, East Mountain, Providence, and Green Ridge, though these areas do not have legal status.

Scranton is the geographic and cultural center of the [[Lackawanna River]] valley and northeastern Pennsylvania, and the largest of the former [[anthracite coal]] mining communities in a contiguous quilt-work that also includes [[Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania|Wilkes-Barre]], [[Nanticoke, Pennsylvania|Nanticoke]], [[Pittston, Pennsylvania|Pittston]], and [[Carbondale, Pennsylvania|Carbondale]]. Scranton was incorporated on February 14, 1856, as a [[borough (Pennsylvania)|borough]] in [[Luzerne County]] and as a [[city (Pennsylvania)|city]] on April 23, 1866. It became a major industrial city, a center of mining and railroads, and attracted thousands of new immigrants. It was the site of the [[Scranton General Strike]] in 1877.

People in northern Luzerne County sought a new county in 1839, but the Wilkes-Barre area resisted losing its assets. Lackawanna County did not gain independent status until 1878. Under legislation allowing the issue to be voted by residents of the proposed territory, voters favored the new county by a proportion of 6 to 1, with Scranton residents providing the major support. The city was designated as the county seat when Lackawanna County was established in 1878, and a judicial district was authorized in July 1879.

The city's nickname "Electric City" began when electric lights were introduced in 1880 at the [[Dickson Manufacturing Company]]. Six years later, the United States' first [[streetcar]]s powered only by electricity began operating in the city.<ref>http://explorepahistory.com/hmarker.php?markerId=1-A-39E</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.phmc.state.pa.us/apps/historical-markers.html|title=Pennsylvania Historical Marker Search|website=www.phmc.state.pa.us}}</ref>{{dubious| the claim is widespread, but it simply means a single line was set up as electric.|date=May 2016}} Rev.

The city's industrial production and population peaked in the 1930s and 1940s, fueled by demand for coal and textiles, especially during [[World War II]]. But while the national economy boomed after the war, demand for the region's coal declined as other forms of energy became more popular, which also harmed the rail industry. Foreseeing the decline, city leaders formulated the Scranton Plan in 1945 to diversify the local economy beyond coal, but the city's economy continued to decline. The [[Knox Mine disaster]] of 1959 essentially ended coal mining in the region. Scranton's population dropped from its peak of 143,000 in the [[1930 United States Census|1930 census]] to 76,000 in the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]]. The city now has large health care and manufacturing sectors.

==History==

===Pre-industrial (1776–1845)===
Present-day Scranton and its surrounding area had been long inhabited by the native [[Lenape|Lenape tribe]], from whose language "Lackawanna" (or ''lac-a-wa-na,'' meaning "stream that forks"), is derived. In 1778, Isaac Tripp, the area's first known white settler, built his home here; it still stands in North Scranton, formerly a separate town known as Providence. More settlers from Connecticut came to the area in the late 18th and early 19th centuries after the [[American Revolutionary War]], as their state claimed this area as part of their colonial charter.

They gradually established mills and other small businesses in a village that became known as Slocum Hollow. People in the village during this time carried the traits and accent of their New England settlers, which were somewhat different from most of Pennsylvania. Some area settlers from Connecticut participated in what was known as the [[Pennamite Wars]], where settlers competed for control of the territory which had been included in royal colonial land grants to both states. (This claim between Connecticut and Pennsylvania was settled by negotiation with the federal government after independence.)

===Arrival of industry (1846–1899)===
[[File:George Inness - The Lackawanna Valley - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|right|[[George Inness]]'s 1855 landscape, ''The Lackawanna Valley'', depicted Scranton and the [[Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad]]'s [[Railway roundhouse|roundhouse]].]]

Though [[anthracite coal]] was being mined in Carbondale to the north and Wilkes-Barre to the south, the industries that precipitated the city's early rapid growth were [[iron]] and [[steel]]. In the 1840s, brothers Selden T. and [[George W. Scranton]], who had worked at [[Oxford Furnace]] in [[Belvidere, New Jersey]], founded what became Lackawanna Iron & Coal, later developing as the [[Lackawanna Steel Company]]. It initially started producing iron nails, but that venture failed due to low-quality iron. The [[Erie Railroad]]'s construction in New York State was delayed by its having to acquire iron rails as imports from England. The Scrantons' firm decided to switch its focus to producing [[Rail profile|T-rails]] for the Erie; the company soon became a major producer of rails for the rapidly expanding railroads.

In 1851, the Scrantons built the [[Lackawanna and Western Railroad]] (L&W) northward, with recent Irish immigrants supplying most of the labor, to meet the Erie Railroad in [[Great Bend, Pennsylvania]]. Thus they could transport manufactured rails from the Lackawanna Valley to New York and the Midwest. They also invested in coal mining operations in the city to fuel their steel operations, and to market it to businesses. In 1856, they expanded the railroad eastward as the [[Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad]] (DL&W), in order to tap into the New York City metropolitan market. This railroad, with its hub in Scranton, was Scranton's largest employer for almost one hundred years.

The Pennsylvania Coal Company built a [[gravity railroad]] in the 1850s through the city for the purpose of transporting coal. The gravity railroad was replaced by a steam railroad built in 1886 by the Erie and Wyoming Valley Railroad (later absorbed by the Erie Railroad).  The [[Delaware and Hudson]] (D&H) Canal Company, which had its own gravity railroad from Carbondale to [[Honesdale]], built a [[steam railroad]] that entered Scranton in 1863.

During this short period of time, the city rapidly transformed from a small, agrarian-based village of people with New England roots to a multicultural, industrial-based city. From 1860 to 1900, the city's population increased more than tenfold. Most new immigrants, such as the Irish, Italians, and south Germans and Polish, were Catholic, a contrast to the majority-Protestant early settlers of colonial descent. National, ethnic, religious and class differences were wrapped into political affiliations, with many new immigrants joining the Democratic Party (and, for a time in the late 1870s, the [[Greenback Party|Greenbacker-Labor]] Party.)

In 1856, the Borough of Scranton was officially incorporated. It was incorporated as a city of 35,000 in 1866 in Luzerne County, when the surrounding boroughs of Hyde Park (now part of the city's West Side) and Providence (now part of North Scranton) were merged with Scranton. Twelve years later in 1878, the state passed a law enabling creation of new counties where a county's population surpassed 150,000, as did Luzerne's. The law appeared to enable the creation of [[Lackawanna County, Pennsylvania|Lackawanna County]], and there was considerable political agitation around the authorizing process. Scranton was designated by the state legislature as the county seat of the newly-formed county, which was also established as a separate judicial district, with state judges moving over from Luzerne County after courts were organized in October 1878. This was the last county in the state to be organized.

Creation of the new county, which enabled both more local control and political patronage, helped begin the [[Scranton General Strike]] of 1877. This was in part due to the larger [[Great Railroad Strike of 1877|Great Railroad Strike]], in which railroad workers began to organize and participate in walkouts after wage cuts in [[Martinsburg, West Virginia]]. The national economy had lagged since the Panic of 1873, and workers in many industries struggled with low wages and intermittent work. In Scranton, mineworkers followed the railroad men off the job, as did others. A protest of 5,000 strikers ended in violence, with a total of four men killed, and 20 to 50 injured, including the mayor. He had established a militia, but called for help from the governor and state militia. Governor [[John Hartranft]] eventually brought in federal troops to quell the strike. The workers gained nothing in wages, but began to organize more purposefully into labor unions that could wield more power.

The nation's first successful, continuously-operating electrified [[streetcar]] (trolley) system was established in the city in 1886, inspiring the nickname "The Electric City". In 1896, the city's various streetcar companies were consolidated into the [[Scranton Railway|Scranton Railway Company]], which ran trolleys until 1954. By 1890, three other railroads had built lines to tap into the rich supply of coal in and around the city, including the Erie Railroad, the [[Central Railroad of New Jersey]] and finally the [[New York, Ontario and Western Railway]] (NYO&W).

As the vast rail network spread above ground, an even larger network of railways served the rapidly expanding system of coal veins underground. Miners, who in the early years were typically Welsh and Irish, were hired as cheaply as possible by the coal barons. The workers endured low pay, long hours and unsafe working conditions. Children as young as eight or nine worked 14-hour days separating slate from coal in the [[coal breaker|breakers]]. Often, the workers were forced to use company-provided housing and purchase food and other goods from stores owned by the coal companies. With hundreds of thousands of immigrants arriving in the industrial cities, mine owners did not have to search for labor and workers struggled to keep their positions. Later miners came from Italy and eastern Europe, which people fled because of poverty and lack of jobs.

Business was booming at the end of the 19th century. The tonnage of coal mined increased virtually every year, as did the steel manufactured by the Lackawanna Steel Company. At one point the company had the largest steel plant in the United States, and it was still the second-largest producer at the turn of the 20th century. By 1900, the city had a population of more than 100,000.

In the late 1890s, Scranton was home to a series of early [[International League]] baseball teams.

===Labor history===
Given its industrial basis, Scranton has had a notable labor history; various coal worker unions struggled throughout the coal-mining era to improve working conditions, raise wages, and guarantee fair treatment for workers.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Azzarelli, Margo L. |author2=Marnie Azzarelli|title=Labor Unrest in Scranton|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sy4LDAAAQBAJ&pg=PT7|year=2016|publisher=Arcadia Publishing|isbn=9781625856814}}</ref>  The Panic of 1873 and other economic difficulties caused a national recession and loss of business. As the economy contracted, the railroad companies reduced wages of workers in most classes (while sometimes reserving raises for their top management). A major strike of railroad workers in August 1877, part of the [[Great Railroad Strike]], attracted workers from the steel industry and mining as well, and developed as the [[Scranton General Strike]]. Four rioters were killed during unrest during the strike, after the mayor mustered a militia. With violence suppressed by militia and federal troops, workers finally returned to their jobs, not able to gain any economic relief. [[William Walker Scranton]], from the prominent family, was then general manager of Lackawanna Iron and Coal. He later founded [[Scranton Steel Company]].

The labor issues and growth of industry in Scranton contributed to Lackawanna County being established by the state legislature in 1878, with territory taken from Luzerne County. Scranton was designated as the county seat. This strengthened its local government.

The unions failed to gain higher wages that year, but in 1878 they elected labor leader [[Terence V. Powderly]] of the [[Knights of Labor]] as mayor of Scranton. After that, he became national leader of the KoL, a predominately{{dubious|Perhaps a bare majority, although the situation may have been different in Scranton.|date=May 2016}} Catholic organization that had a peak membership of 700,000 circa 1880.<ref>Vincent J. Falzone, "Terence V. Powderly: Politician and Progressive Mayor of Scranton, 1878-1884," ''Pennsylvania History'' 41.3 (1974): 289-309.</ref> While the Catholic Church had prohibited membership in secret organizations since the mid-18th century, by the late 1880s with the influence of Archbishop [[James Gibbons]] of [[Baltimore, Maryland]], it supported the Knights of Labor as representing workingmen and union organizing.

The landmark [[Coal strike of 1902]], was called by anthracite miners across the region and led by the [[United Mine Workers]] under [[John Mitchell (United Mine Workers)|John Mitchell]]. The strike was settled by a compromise brokered by President [[Theodore Roosevelt]]. A statue of John Mitchell was installed in his honor on the grounds of the Lackawanna County Courthouse in Scranton, "the site of the Coal Strike of 1902 negotiations in which President Roosevelt participated. Because of the significance of these negotiations, the statue and the Courthouse were added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1997. John Mitchell is buried in Cathedral Cemetery in Scranton."<ref>{{cite news|author=Sarah Scinto|title=Labor leader's grave restored|url=http://thetimes-tribune.com/news/labor-leader-s-grave-restored-1.1577236|publisher=Scranton Times-Tribune|date=October 30, 2013}}</ref>

===Growth, prosperity and consequences (1900–1945)===

By the [[United States Census]] of 1900, the population of Scranton was about 102,026, making it the third-largest city in Pennsylvania and 38th-largest U.S. city.<ref name="autogenerated2">{{cite web|url=http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/42/4269000.html|title=Scranton(city) QuickFacts|accessdate=2007-07-24}}</ref>
At the turn of the 20th century, wealthy businessmen and industrialists built impressive [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] mansions in the Hill and Green Ridge sections of the city. Most were descended from colonists and belonged to the Republican Party. The industrial workers, who tended to be later immigrants from Ireland and southern and eastern Europe, were predominately Catholic. With a flood of immigrants in the market, they suffered poor working conditions and wages.

In 1902, the dwindling local iron ore supply, labor issues, and an aging plant cost the city the industry on which it was founded. The Lackawanna Steel Company and many of its workers were moved to [[Lackawanna, New York]], developed on [[Lake Erie]] just south of [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]]. With a port on the lake, the company could receive iron ore shipped from the [[Mesabi Range]] in Minnesota, which was being newly mined. 

Scranton forged ahead as the capital of the anthracite coal industry. Attracting the thousands of workers needed to mine coal, the city developed new neighborhoods dominated by Italian and Eastern European immigrants, who brought their foods, cultures and religions. Many of the immigrants joined the Democratic Party. Their national churches and neighborhoods were part of the history of the city. Several [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] and [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] churches were founded and built during this period. A substantial Jewish community was also established, with most members coming from the Russian Empire and eastern Europe. Working conditions for miners were improved by the efforts of labor leaders such as [[John Mitchell (United Mine Workers)|John Mitchell]], who led the [[United Mine Workers]].

The sub-surface mining weakened whole neighborhoods, however, damaging homes, schools, and businesses when the land collapsed. In 1913 the state passed the Davis Act to establish the Bureau of Surface Support in Scranton. Because of the difficulty in dealing with the coal companies, citizens organized the [[Scranton Surface Protection Association]], chartered by the Court of Common Pleas on November 24, 1913 "to protect the lives and property of the citizens of the City of Scranton and the streets of said city from injury, loss and damage caused by mining and mine caves."<ref name="kashuba"/>

In 1915 and 1917, the city and Commonwealth sought injunctions to prevent coal companies from undermining city streets but lost their cases. North Main Avenue and Boulevard Avenue, "both entitled to surface support, caved in as a result" of court decisions that went against civil authorities and allowed the coal companies to continue their operations.<ref name="kashuba"/>

"The case of ''Penman v. Jones'' came out differently. The Lackawanna Iron & Coal Co. had leased coal lands to the Lackawanna Iron & Steel Co., an allied interest, which passed the leases on to the Scranton Coal Co. Areas of central Scranton, the Hill Section, South Side, Pine Brook, Green Ridge and Hyde Park were affected by their mining activities. Mr. Penman was the private property owner in the case. The coal operators were defeated in this case."<ref name="kashuba">[http://thetimes-tribune.com/news/scranton-takes-on-mining-cave-ins-1.1046286 Cheryl A. Kashuba, "Scranton takes on mining, cave-ins"], ''The Times-Tribune,'' 10 October 2010, accessed 23 May 2016</ref>

The public transportation system began to expand beyond the trolley lines pioneered by predecessors of the Scranton Railways system. The [[Lackawanna and Wyoming Valley Railroad]], commonly referred to as the Laurel Line, was built as an interurban passenger and freight carrier to [[Wilkes-Barre]]. Its Scranton station, offices, powerhouse and maintenance facility were built on the former grounds of the Lackawanna Steel Company, and operations started in 1903. Beginning in 1907, Scrantonians could also ride trolley cars to the northern suburbs of [[Clarks Summit, Pennsylvania|Clarks Summit]] and [[Dalton, Pennsylvania|Dalton]]. They could travel to [[Lake Winola]] and [[Montrose, Pennsylvania|Montrose]] using the [[Scranton, Montrose and Binghamton Railroad|Northern Electric]] Railroad. After the 1920s, no new trolley lines were built, but bus operations were started and expanded to meet service needs. In 1934, Scranton Railways was re-incorporated as the Scranton Transit Company, reflecting that shift in transportation modes.<ref>''The Scranton Republican,'' July 5, 1934, "Railway Firm's New Financial Setup Revealed", p. 1</ref>

Starting in the early 1920s, the [[Scranton Button Company]] (founded in 1885 and a major maker of shellac buttons) became one of the primary makers of phonograph records. They pressed records for [[Emerson Records|Emerson]] (whom they bought in 1924), as well as [[Regal Records (1921)|Regal]], [[Cameo Records|Cameo]], [[Romeo Records|Romeo]], [[Banner Records|Banner]], [[Domino Records (1924)|Domino]], [[Conqueror Records|Conqueror]]. In July 1929, the company merged with Regal, Cameo, Banner, and the U.S. branch of [[Pathé Records|Pathé]] (makers of Pathé and [[Perfect Records|Perfect]]) to become the [[American Record Corporation]]. By 1938, the Scranton company was also pressing records for [[Brunswick Records|Brunswick]], [[Melotone Records (US)|Melotone]], and [[Vocalion Records|Vocalion]]. In 1946, the company was acquired by [[Capitol Records]], which continued to produce [[phonograph records]] through the end of the vinyl era.

By the mid-1930s, the city population had swelled beyond 140,000<ref name="autogenerated2"/> due to growth in the mining and [[silk]] textile industries. World War II created a great demand for energy, which led to the highest production from [[mining]] in the area since World War I.

===Post–World War II (1946–1984)===
After World War II, coal lost favor to [[oil]] and [[natural gas]] as a heating fuel, largely because the latter types were more convenient to use. While some U.S. cities prospered in the post-war boom, the fortunes and population of Scranton (and the rest of Lackawanna and [[Luzerne County, Pennsylvania|Luzerne]] counties) began to diminish. Coal production and rail traffic declined rapidly throughout the 1950s, causing a loss of jobs.

The [[Knox Mine Disaster]] of January 1959 virtually ended the mining industry in Northeastern Pennsylvania. The waters of the [[Susquehanna River]] flooded the mines.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zwire.com/site/news.cfm?newsid=10845647&BRD=2259&PAG=461&dept_id=460522&rfi=8 |title=The Citizens Voice – Knox mine disaster remains in our memory because it is a story of right and wrong |publisher=Zwire.com |accessdate=2011-08-29 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090107061533/http://www.zwire.com/site/news.cfm?newsid=10845647&BRD=2259&PAG=461&dept_id=460522&rfi=8 |archive-date=January 7, 2009 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.msha.gov/District/Dist_01/Reports/Knox/cover.htm |title=cover |publisher=Msha.gov |accessdate=2011-08-29}}</ref> The DL&W Railroad, nearly bankrupted by the drop in coal traffic and the effects of Hurricane Diane, merged in 1960 with the Erie Railroad.
Demand for public transportation also declined as new highways were built by federal subsidies and people purchased automobiles. In 1952, the Laurel Line ceased passenger service. The Scranton Transit Company, whose trolleys had given the city its nickname, transferred all operations to buses as the 1954 holiday season approached; by the end of 1971, it ceased all operations. The city was left without any public transportation system for almost a year until the Lackawanna County government formed [[County of Lackawanna Transit System|COLTS]], which began operations in late 1972 with 1950s-era GM busses from New Jersey.

Scranton had been the hub of its operations until the [[Erie Lackawanna]] merger, after which it no longer served in this capacity. This was another severe blow to the local labor market. The NYO&W Railroad, which depended heavily on its Scranton branch for freight traffic, was abandoned in 1957. Mine [[subsidence]] was a spreading problem in the city as pillar supports in abandoned mines began to fail; cave-ins sometimes consumed entire blocks of homes. The area was left scarred by abandoned coal mining structures, strip mines, and massive [[culm dump]]s, some of which caught fire and burned for many years until they were extinguished through government efforts. In 1970, the Secretary of Mines for Pennsylvania suggested that so many underground voids had been left by mining underneath Scranton that it would be "more economical" to abandon the city than make them safe.<ref>{{cite book |title=Facts & Trivia |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |author-link=Isaac Asimov |year=1998 |publisher=Siena |location=Bristol |isbn=0-75252-822-X |page=74}}</ref> In 1973, the last mine operations in Lackawanna County (which were in what is now [[McDade Park]], and another on the Scranton/[[Dickson City]] line) were closed. During the 1960s and 1970s, the silk and other textile industries shrank as jobs were moved to the South or overseas.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}

===Stabilization and restoration (1985–present)===

Since the mid-1980s, the city has emphasized revitalization. Local government and much of the community at large have adopted a renewed interest in the city's buildings and history. Some historic properties have been renovated and marketed as tourist attractions. The [[Steamtown National Historic Site]] captures the area's once-prominent position in the railroad industry. The former DL&W train station was restored as the [[Radisson Lackawanna Station Hotel]]. The [[Electric City Trolley Museum]] was created next to the DL&W yards that the Steamtown NHS occupies.

Since the mid-1980s the [[Scranton Cultural Center]] has operated the architecturally significant Masonic Temple and Scottish Rite Cathedral, designed by [[Raymond Hood]], as the region's performing arts center. The [[Houdini Museum]] was opened in Scranton in 1990 by nationally known magician [[Dorothy Dietrich]].

In 2003, [[Hilton Hotels & Resorts]] opened the [http://www3.hilton.com/en/hotels/pennsylvania/hilton-scranton-and-conference-center-SCRCCHF/index.html Hilton Scranton Hotel & Conference Center] at the corner of Adams Avenue & Lackawanna Avenue in the heart of downtown Scranton. Due to the rage for paranormal-themed televisions shows, a popular downtown historic Scranton Ghost Walk<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://scrantonghostwalk.com/|title=Scranton Ghost Walk|website=scrantonghostwalk.com|access-date=2017-03-16}}</ref> has been expanded to operate 365 days a year. Other attractions include the [[Montage Mountain Ski Resort|Montage Mountain ski resort]] (formerly Snö Mountain), the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins, [[American Hockey League|AHL]] affiliate of the [[Pittsburgh Penguins]]; the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre RailRiders (formerly the Scranton/Wilkes Barre Yankees and, before that, the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Red Barons), AAA affiliate of the [[New York Yankees]]; and their [[PNC Field]], and the [[Toyota Pavilion at Montage Mountain]] concert venue.

According to ''[[The Guardian]]'', the city was close to bankruptcy in July 2012, with the wages of all municipal officials, including the mayor and fire chief, being cut to $7.25/hour.<ref name="guard">{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jul/14/scranton-pennsylvania-bankrupt-minimum-wage |title=Scranton, Pennsylvania: Where even the mayor is on minimum wage |last=Harris |first=Paul |date=2012-07-14 |work=The Guardian |access-date=2012-07-14}}</ref> Financial consultant Gary Lewis, who lives in Scranton, was quoted as estimating that "on 5 July the city had just $5,000 cash in hand."<ref name="guard" />

Since the revitalization began, many coffee shops, restaurants, and bars have opened in the downtown, creating a vibrant night-life. The low [[cost of living]], [[Walkability|pedestrian-friendly]] downtown, and the construction of [[Loft apartment|loft-style apartments]] in older, architecturally significant buildings have attracted young professionals and artists. Many are individuals who grew up in Scranton, moved to big cities after high school and college, and decided to return to the area to take advantage of its amenities. Many buildings around the city that were once empty are currently being restored. Many of the restored buildings will be used to entice new business into the city. Some of the newly renovated buildings are already being used. <ref>{{cite journal|last1=Rich|first1=Megan|title="From Coal To Cool": The Creative Class, Social Capital, And The Revitalization Of Scranton|journal=Journal of Urban Affairs|date=27 September 2012|volume=35|issue=3|pages=365–384|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9906.2012.00639.x|s2cid=143899777}}</ref>

Scranton's provider of public transportation is the [[County of Lackawanna Transit System]] (COLTS). COLTS buses provide extensive service within the city and more limited service that reaches in all directions to [[Carbondale, Pennsylvania|Carbondale]], [[Covington Township, Lackawanna County, Pennsylvania|Daleville]], [[Pittston]], and [[Benton Township, Lackawanna County, Pennsylvania|Fleetville]]. The other bussing company is the [[Luzerne County Transportation Authority]] (LCTA), which mainly runs through The Minooka section (closest to Luzerne County) and Downtown Scranton by The Mall at Steamtown. LCTA takes passengers from Scranton to the [[Mohegan Sun Pocono]] racino in [[Plains, Pennsylvania|Plains]]

====Railroads====
Rail transportation, in both freight and passenger, were vital to the city's historic growth. The city was a hub, serving the [[Central Railroad of New Jersey]] (CNJ), the [[Delaware and Hudson Railway]], the [[Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad]] (DLW), and the [[Erie Railroad]], with routes radiating in all directions, to New York State's Southern Tier, to several points in Pennsylvania, and to parts in northern New Jersey.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Index of Railroad Stations, 1480|journal=Official Guide of the Railways |publisher=National Railway Publication Company |volume=74 |issue=1 |date=June 1941}}</ref> The [[Scranton station (Central Railroad of New Jersey)|CNJ station]] and the [[Radisson Lackawanna Station Hotel|DLW station]] were the last to lose passenger service, in the early 1950s and in 1970, respectively.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Central Railroad of New Jersey, Table 1|journal=Official Guide of the Railways |publisher=National Railway Publication Company |volume=87 |issue=7 |date=December 1954}}</ref><ref name="roddy">{{cite news |title= Repeating for All Needing |first=  Michael|last=Roddy |newspaper= Associated Press|date= December 30, 1982}}</ref>

Freight rail remains important vital today in Scranton.

The [[Norfolk Southern Railway]] runs freight trains on the former Delaware, Lackawanna & Western (DL&W) line between Scranton and Binghamton, having taken over operations from the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] (Delaware and Hudson Railway division) in 2015. The [[Reading Blue Mountain & Northern Railroad]] serves the former DL&W Keyser Valley branch in the city.

The [[Delaware-Lackawanna Railroad]], as designated operator of county-owned rail lines, oversees the former Delaware and Hudson line from Scranton north to Carbondale, the former DL&W line east to the [[Delaware Water Gap]] and the former [[Lackawanna and Wyoming Valley Railroad]] third-rail [[interurban streetcar]] line south to Montage Mountain, [[Moosic]]. These lines host the seasonal passenger trains of both the [[Steamtown National Historic Site]] and the [[Electric City Trolley Museum]] and are under the jurisdiction of the [[Pennsylvania Northeast Regional Rail Authority]].

The PNRRA was created by [[Lackawanna County, Pennsylvania|Lackawanna County]] and [[Monroe County, Pennsylvania|Monroe County]] to oversee the use of common rail freight lines in [[Northeastern Pennsylvania]], including one formerly owned by [[Conrail]] running from Scranton, through the [[the Poconos|Pocono Mountains]] towards [[New Jersey]] and the New York City market.

One of its primary objectives is to re-establish rail passenger service to [[Hoboken, New Jersey]] and thence by connection to New York.
Indeed, regular passenger train service to Scranton is slated to be restored under a plan to extend [[NJ Transit]] service from Hoboken via the [[Lackawanna Cut-Off]].  That project is ongoing as rail is being laid down in New Jersey.<ref name="njt">{{cite web|url=http://www.njtransit.com/tm/tm_servlet.srv?hdnPageAction=Project019To|title=Lackawanna Cutoff|publisher=[[New Jersey Transit]]|date=October 2009|accessdate=2011-01-02}}</ref><ref name="njarp_2009">{{cite web|title=NJ-ARP Annual Report 2008–2009 |date=November 19, 2009 |url=http://www.nj-arp.org/annrpt_09.pdf |accessdate=2011-01-02 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110101043557/http://www.nj-arp.org/annrpt_09.pdf |archive-date=January 1, 2011 }}</ref> The trains would pass the Lackawanna Station building and pull in at [[Scranton (NJT station)|a new Scranton station]] on Lackawanna Avenue along the northernmost track east of Bridge 60 (the railroad bridge over the [[Lackawanna River]]) and the Cliff Street underpass.<ref>NEW JERSEY – PENNSYLVANIA LACKAWANNA CUT-OFF

The city is imagined as a member of the class of interstellar [[Okies]] in [[James Blish]]'s 1962 novel, ''[[A Life for the Stars]]'', in which 2273 AD Scranton, equipped with a space drive, flies away and leaves an impoverished Earth behind.

In 2017, Scranton got national recognition from late night television host [[John Oliver]] when he made jokes about how infatuated Scranton community members were with the little train that runs during the weather reports on Scranton's [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]-affiliated TV station [[WNEP-TV]]. The train had been featured in multiple of their Talkback16 segments. After a followup segment, Oliver donated a train set to WNEP. It was too big for their backyard, so they donated it to The [[Electric City Trolley Museum]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://wnep.com/2017/09/24/thousands-flock-to-electric-city-trolley-museum-to-see-the-new-backyard-train/ |title=John Oliver Reacts to Thousands Flocking to See the New Backyard Train |last=Whitehead |first=Anja |publisher=[[WNEP]] |date=25 September 2017 |access-date=18 December 2019}}</ref>
