An [[Armenian Genocide]] survivor, Karsh migrated to Canada as a refugee. By the 1930s he established himself as a significant photographer in Ottawa, where he lived most of his adult life, though he traveled extensively for work.

Over 20 photos by Karsh appeared on the cover of ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine, until he retired in 1992.

==Career==
Karsh settled in Ottawa and opened his first studio in 1932.<ref name="nyt obituary"/><ref name="canadianencyclopedia"/> It was located on the second floor of a building at 130 [[Sparks Street]], which was later named the Hardy Arcade.<ref name="ottawacitizen2009"/> He remained there until 1972, when he moved to [[Château Laurier]].<ref name="canadianencyclopedia"/> He was known professionally as "Karsh of Ottawa",<ref name="gg.ca"/><ref name="guardian"/><ref name="ottawacitizen"/><ref name="irishtimes"/> which was also his signature.<ref name="people"/> He achieved initial success by capturing the attention of Canadian Prime Minister [[Mackenzie King]], who helped Karsh arrange photography sessions with visiting dignitaries.<ref name="Time Berman"/>

Throughout his life, Karsh photographed "anyone who was anyone."<ref name="economist"/> When asked why he almost exclusively captured famous people, he replied, "I am working with the world's most remarkable cross-section of people. I do believe it's the minority who make the world go around, not the majority."<ref name="guardian"/> He once also jokingly remarked, "I do it for my own immortality."<ref name="people"/> By the time he retired in 1992, more than 20 of his photos had appeared on the cover of ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine.<ref name="Time Berman"/> Karsh's photos were known for their use of dramatic [[lighting]], which became the hallmark of his portrait style.

It was arranged by Canadian Prime Minister Mackenzie King.<ref name="telegraph"/><ref name="ottawacitizen"/> Churchill is particularly noted for his posture and facial expression, which have been compared to the wartime feelings that prevailed in the UK: persistence in the face of an all-conquering enemy. The photo session was short and, just before exposure, Karsh moved towards Churchill and removed the cigar which he had in his hand. Churchill was miffed and showed his displeasure in the portrait.<ref name="economist"/> The photo, which according to ''[[The Economist]]'' is the "most reproduced portrait in the history of photography",<ref name="economist"/> has been described as one of the "most iconic portraits ever shot".<ref name="ottawacitizen"/> [[USC Fisher Museum of Art]] described it as a "defiant and scowling portrait [which] became an instant icon of Britain's stand against fascism."<ref>{{cite web|last1=Travis|first1=David|title=Yousuf Karsh: Regarding Heroes|url=https://fisher.usc.edu/yousuf-karsh-regarding-heroes/|publisher=[[USC Fisher Museum of Art]], [[University of Southern California]]|year=2010}}</ref> It appeared on the cover of the May 21, 1945 issue of ''Life'',<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Winston Churchill|magazine=Life|date=21 May 1945|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=50kEAAAAMBAJ}}</ref> which bought it for $100.<ref name="economist"/> It now hangs on the wall of the Speaker's chamber.<ref name="ottawacitizen"/>

According to [[Amanda Hopkinson]] it made Hemingway look like the hero of his novel ''[[The Old Man and the Sea]]''.<ref name="guardian"/> His other notable portraits include [[George Bernard Shaw]] at an old age (1943), [[Dwight D.
