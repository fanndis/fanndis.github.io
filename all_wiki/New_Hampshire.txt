'''New Hampshire''' ({{IPAc-en|'|h|æ|m|p|ʃ|ər}}) is a [[U.S. state|state]] in the [[New England]] region of the [[northeastern United States]]. It is bordered by [[Massachusetts]] to the south, [[Vermont]] to the west, [[Maine]] and the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to the east, and the Canadian province of [[Quebec]] to the north. New Hampshire is the [[List of U.S. states and territories by area|5th smallest]] by area and the [[List of U.S. states and territories by population|10th least populous]] U.S. state. [[Concord, New Hampshire|Concord]] is the state capital, while [[Manchester, New Hampshire|Manchester]] is the largest city. New Hampshire has no general [[Sales taxes in the United States|sales tax]], nor [[income tax]] other than on interest and dividends. The [[New Hampshire primary]] is the first [[U.S. presidential primary|primary]] in the U.S. presidential election cycle. Its license plates carry the [[List of U.S. state mottos|state motto]], "[[Live Free or Die]]". The state's [[state nickname|nickname]], "The [[Granite]] State", refers to its extensive granite formations and [[quarries]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Visit NH: State Facts |publisher=NH Department of Resources and Economic Development |access-date=August 30, 2010 |url = http://www.visitnh.gov/welcome-to-nh/state-facts.aspx |url-status=dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20101014112959/http://www.visitnh.gov/welcome-to-nh/state-facts.aspx |archive-date=October 14, 2010 }}</ref>

In January 1776, it became the first of the British North American [[European colonization of the Americas|colonies]] to establish a government independent of the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]]'s authority; it was the first to establish its own state constitution. Six months later, it became one of the original [[Thirteen Colonies|13 colonies]] that signed the [[United States Declaration of Independence]], and in June 1788 it was the ninth state to ratify the [[United States Constitution]], bringing that document into effect. Historically, New Hampshire was a major center for [[textile manufacturing]], [[shoemaking]], and [[papermaking]], with [[Amoskeag Manufacturing Company]] in Manchester at one time being the largest cotton textile plant in the world. Numerous mills were located along various rivers in the state, especially the [[Merrimack River|Merrimack]] and [[Connecticut River|Connecticut]] rivers. Many [[French Canadian]]s migrated to New Hampshire to work the mills in the late 19th and early 20th century; New Hampshire still ranks second among states by percentage of people claiming [[French Americans|French American]] ancestry, with 24.5% of the state identifying as such.

Manufacturing centers such as Manchester, Nashua and Berlin were hit hard in the 1930s–1940s as major manufacturing industries left New England and moved to the [[Southern United States]] or overseas, reflecting nationwide trends. In the 1950s and 1960s, [[Defense industry|defense contractors]] moved into many of the former mills, such as [[Sanders Associates]] in Nashua; the population of southern New Hampshire surged beginning in the 1980s as major highways connected the region to [[Greater Boston]] and established several [[bedroom communities]] in the state. With some of the [[List of New England ski areas by vertical drop|highest ski mountains on the East Coast]], New Hampshire's major recreational attractions include [[skiing]], snowmobiling, and other winter sports, hiking and mountaineering ([[Mount Monadnock]] in the state's southwestern corner is among the most climbed mountains in the U.S.), [[leaf peeping|observing the fall foliage]], summer cottages along many lakes and the seacoast, motor sports at the [[New Hampshire Motor Speedway]], and [[Laconia Motorcycle Week|Motorcycle Week]], a popular motorcycle rally held in [[Weirs Beach, New Hampshire|Weirs Beach]] in [[Laconia, New Hampshire|Laconia]] in June. The [[White Mountain National Forest]] links the Vermont and Maine portions of the [[Appalachian Trail]], and has the [[Mount Washington Auto Road]], where visitors may drive to the top of {{convert|6288|ft|m|adj=on}} [[Mount Washington (New Hampshire)|Mount Washington]].

==Etymology==

The state was named after the southern [[England|English]] [[Counties of England|county]] of [[Hampshire]] by [[John Mason (governor)|Captain John Mason]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Origin of 'New Hampshire' |url=http://www.statesymbolsusa.org/symbol-official-item/new-hampshire/state-name-origin/origin-new-hampshire |publisher=State Symbols USA |access-date=August 30, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150904004447/http://www.statesymbolsusa.org/symbol-official-item/new-hampshire/state-name-origin/origin-new-hampshire |archive-date=September 4, 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref>

New Hampshire is part of the six-state New England region. It is bounded by Quebec, Canada, to the north and northwest; Maine and the Atlantic Ocean to the east; Massachusetts to the south; and Vermont to the west. New Hampshire's major regions are the [[Great North Woods Region (New Hampshire)|Great North Woods]], the [[White Mountains Region|White Mountains]], the [[Lakes Region (New Hampshire)|Lakes Region]], the [[Seacoast Region (New Hampshire)|Seacoast]], the [[Merrimack Valley]], the [[Monadnock Region]], and the [[Dartmouth-Lake Sunapee Region|Dartmouth-Lake Sunapee]] area. New Hampshire has the shortest ocean coastline of any U.S. coastal state, with a length of {{convert|18|mi|km}},<ref>{{cite map |url=http://des.nh.gov/organization/divisions/water/wmb/coastal/documents/coastal_access_map.pdf |title=New Hampshire Coastal Access Map |publisher=New Hampshire Coastal Program |access-date=February 3, 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304075419/http://des.nh.gov/organization/divisions/water/wmb/coastal/documents/coastal_access_map.pdf |archivedate=March 4, 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref> sometimes measured as only {{convert|13|mi}}.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/RS21729.pdf |last=Beaver |first=Janice Cheryl |title=U.S. International Borders: Brief Facts |publisher=Congressional Research Service |date=November 9, 2006 |access-date=February 3, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190401163943/https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/RS21729.pdf |archive-date=April 1, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> 

The [[White Mountains (New Hampshire)|White Mountains range]] in New Hampshire spans the north-central portion of the state. The range includes [[Mount Washington (New Hampshire)|Mount Washington]], the tallest in the northeastern U.S.—site of the second-highest wind speed ever recorded—<ref>{{Cite news |last=Filipov |first=David |title=Record blown away, but pride stays put: N.H. summit's claim to nasty weather intact |newspaper=[[The Boston Globe]] |date=January 31, 2010 |url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/new_hampshire/articles/2010/01/31/record_blown_away_but_pride_stays_put/ |access-date=February 9, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100203163847/http://www.boston.com/news/local/new_hampshire/articles/2010/01/31/record_blown_away_but_pride_stays_put/ |archive-date=February 3, 2010 |url-status=live }}</ref>as well as [[Mount Adams (New Hampshire)|Mount Adams]] and [[Mount Jefferson (New Hampshire)|Mount Jefferson]]. With hurricane-force winds every third day on average, more than a hundred recorded deaths among visitors, and conspicuous [[krumholtz]] (dwarf, matted trees much like a carpet of [[bonsai]] trees), the climate on the upper reaches of Mount Washington has inspired the weather observatory on the peak to claim that the area has the "World's Worst Weather".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mountwashington.org/ |title=Mount Washington ...

Washington Observatory |access-date=March 22, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100118122712/http://www.mountwashington.org/ |archive-date=January 18, 2010 |url-status=live }}</ref> The White Mountains were home to the rock formation called the [[Old Man of the Mountain]], a face-like profile in [[Franconia Notch]], until the formation disintegrated in May 2003. Even after its loss, the Old Man remains an enduring symbol for the state, seen on state highway signs, automobile license plates, and many government and private entities around New Hampshire.

In the flatter southwest corner of New Hampshire, the landmark [[Mount Monadnock]] has given its name to a class of earth-forms—a ''[[monadnock]]''—signifying, in geomorphology, any isolated resistant peak rising from a less resistant eroded plain.

Major rivers include the {{convert|110|mi|km|adj=on|sigfig=3}} [[Merrimack River]], which bisects the lower half of the state north–south before passing into Massachusetts and reaching the sea in [[Newburyport, Massachusetts|Newburyport]]. Its tributaries include the [[Contoocook River]], [[Pemigewasset River]], and [[Winnipesaukee River]]. The {{convert|410|mi|km|adj=on|sigfig=3}} [[Connecticut River]], which starts at New Hampshire's [[Connecticut Lakes]] and flows south to [[Connecticut]], defines the western border with Vermont. The state border is not in the center of that river, as is usually the case, but at the low-water mark on the Vermont side; meaning the entire river along the Vermont border (save for areas where the water level has been raised by a dam) lies within New Hampshire.<ref>''Vermont v. New Hampshire'' {{Ussc|289|593|1933}}</ref> Only one town—[[Pittsburg, New Hampshire|Pittsburg]]—shares a land border with the state of Vermont. The "northwesternmost headwaters" of the Connecticut also define the part of Canada–U.S. border.

The [[Piscataqua River]] and its several [[tributary|tributaries]] form the state's only significant ocean port where they flow into the Atlantic at [[Portsmouth, New Hampshire|Portsmouth]]. The [[Salmon Falls River]] and the Piscataqua define the southern portion of the border with Maine. The Piscataqua River boundary was the subject of a [[Piscataqua River border dispute|border dispute]] between New Hampshire and Maine in 2001, with New Hampshire claiming dominion over several islands (primarily [[Seavey's Island]]) that include the [[Portsmouth Naval Shipyard]]. The [[United States Supreme Court|U.S. Supreme Court]] dismissed the case in 2002, leaving ownership of the island with Maine. New Hampshire still claims sovereignty of the base, however.<ref>{{cite web |title = HJR 1—Final Version |url = http://gencourt.state.nh.us/legislation/2006/hjr0001.html |publisher = [[New Hampshire General Court]] |access-date = September 22, 2015 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151016014356/http://gencourt.state.nh.us/legislation/2006/hjr0001.html |archive-date = October 16, 2015 |url-status = live }}</ref>

The largest of [[List of lakes in New Hampshire|New Hampshire's lakes]] is [[Lake Winnipesaukee]], which covers {{convert|71|sqmi|km2|sigfig=3}} in the east-central part of New Hampshire. [[Umbagog Lake]] along the Maine border, approximately {{convert|12.3|sqmi|km2|sigfig=3}}, is a distant second. [[Squam Lake]] is the second largest lake entirely in New Hampshire.

The northern third of the state is locally referred to as the "north country" or "north of the notches", in reference to White Mountain [[mountain pass|passes]] that channel traffic. It contains less than 5% of the state's population, suffers relatively high poverty, and is steadily losing population as the logging and paper industries decline. However, the tourist industry, in particular visitors who go to northern New Hampshire to [[skiing|ski]], [[snowboarding|snowboard]], [[hiking|hike]] and [[mountain biking|mountain bike]], has helped offset economic losses from mill closures.

Winter season lengths are projected to decline at ski areas across New Hampshire due to the [[effects of global warming]], which is likely to continue the historic contraction and consolidation of the ski industry and threaten individual ski businesses and communities that rely on ski tourism.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/226142172|title=Climate Change Vulnerability of the Northeast US Winter Tourism Sector|format=PDF |publisher=University of Ottawa Department of Geography and Institute of Science |accessdate=February 3, 2019}}</ref>

New Hampshire experiences a [[humid continental climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Dfa'' in some southern areas, ''Dfb'' in most of the state, and ''Dfc'' subarctic in some northern highland areas), with warm, humid summers, and long, cold, and snowy winters. Precipitation is fairly evenly distributed all year. The climate of the southeastern portion is moderated by the [[Atlantic Ocean]] and averages relatively milder winters (for New Hampshire), while the northern and interior portions experience colder temperatures and lower humidity. Winters are cold and snowy throughout the state, and especially severe in the northern and mountainous areas. Average annual snowfall ranges from {{convert|60|in|cm}} to over {{convert|100|in|cm}} across the state.<ref name=noaasnow>{{cite web| url=http://lwf.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/climate/online/ccd/snowfall.html |title=Snowfall—Average Total in Inches |publisher=[[NOAA]] |date=June 23, 2004 |first=Dan |last=Dellinger |accessdate=May 25, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110619061102/http://www.governor.nh.gov/media/news/2011/061511-hb218.htm |archivedate=June 19, 2011 }}</ref>

Average daytime highs are in the mid 70s°F to low 80s°F (24–28°C) throughout the state in July, with overnight lows in the mid 50s°F to low 60s°F (13–15°C). January temperatures range from an average high of {{convert|34|F|C}} on the coast to overnight lows below {{convert|0|F|C}} in the far north and at high elevations. Average annual precipitation statewide is roughly {{convert|40|in|cm}} with some variation occurring in the [[White Mountains (New Hampshire)|White Mountains]] due to differences in elevation and annual snowfall. New Hampshire's highest recorded temperature was {{convert|106|F|C}} in [[Nashua, New Hampshire|Nashua]] on July 4, 1911, while the lowest recorded temperature was {{convert|-47|F|C}} atop [[Mount Washington (New Hampshire)|Mount Washington]] on January 29, 1934. Mount Washington also saw an unofficial {{convert|-50|F|C}} reading on January 22, 1885, which, if made official, would tie the all-time record low for New England (also {{convert|-50|F|C}} at [[Big Black River (Saint John River)|Big Black River]], Maine, on January 16, 2009, and [[Bloomfield, Vermont]] on December 30, 1933).

Extreme snow is often associated with a [[nor'easter]], such as the [[Northeastern United States blizzard of 1978|Blizzard of '78]] and the [[Blizzard of 1993]], when several feet accumulated across portions of the state over 24 to 48 hours. Lighter snowfalls of several inches occur frequently throughout winter, often associated with an [[Alberta Clipper]].

New Hampshire, on occasion, is affected by [[tropical cyclone|hurricanes]] and tropical storms although by the time they reach the state they are often [[extratropical]], with most storms striking the southern New England coastline and moving inland or passing by offshore in the [[Gulf of Maine]]. Most of New Hampshire averages fewer than 20 days of thunderstorms per year and an average of two tornadoes occur annually statewide.<ref name="noaatornado">{{cite web |title=Annual average number of tornadoes 1953–2004 |url=http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/img/climate/research/tornado/small/avgt5304.gif |publisher=NOAA |access-date=May 25, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111016174155/http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/img/climate/research/tornado/small/avgt5304.gif |archive-date=October 16, 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Various [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]]-speaking [[Abenaki people|Abenaki]] tribes, largely divided between the [[Androscoggin people|Androscoggin]] and [[Pennacook]] nations, inhabited the area before European settlement.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tolatsga.org/aben.html|title=Abenaki|website=tolatsga.org|access-date=September 4, 2017|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100411025556/http://www.tolatsga.org/aben.html|archive-date=April 11, 2010}}</ref> Despite the similar language, they had a very different culture and religion from other Algonquian peoples. English and French explorers visited New Hampshire in 1600–1605, and [[David Thompson (New Hampshire settler)|David Thompson]] settled at [[Odiorne Point State Park|Odiorne's Point]] in present-day [[Rye, New Hampshire|Rye]] in 1623. The first permanent settlement was at Hilton's Point (present-day [[Dover, New Hampshire|Dover]]). By 1631, the Upper Plantation comprised modern-day [[Dover, New Hampshire|Dover]], [[Durham, New Hampshire|Durham]] and [[Stratham, New Hampshire|Stratham]]; in 1679, it became the "[[Province of New Hampshire|Royal Province]]". [[Father Rale's War]] was fought between the colonists and the [[Wabanaki Confederacy]] throughout New Hampshire.

New Hampshire was one of the [[thirteen colonies]] that rebelled against British rule during the [[American Revolution]]. By the time of the American Revolution, New Hampshire was a divided province. The economic and social life of the Seacoast region revolved around sawmills, shipyards, merchants' warehouses, and established village and town centers. Wealthy merchants built substantial homes, furnished them with the finest luxuries, and invested their capital in trade and land speculation. At the other end of the social scale, there developed a permanent class of day laborers, mariners, indentured servants and even slaves.

The only battle fought in New Hampshire was the raid on [[Fort William and Mary]], December 14, 1774, in [[Portsmouth Harbor]], which netted the rebellion sizable quantities of gunpowder, small arms and cannon. ([[John Sullivan (general)|General Sullivan]], leader of the raid, described it as, "remainder of the powder, the small arms, bayonets, and cartouche-boxes, together with the cannon and ordnance stores") over the course of two nights. This raid was preceded by a warning to local patriots the previous day, by [[Paul Revere]] on December 13, 1774, that the fort was to be reinforced by troops sailing from Boston. According to unverified accounts, the gunpowder was later used at the Battle of Bunker Hill, transported there by Major Demerit, who was one of several New Hampshire patriots who stored the powder in their homes until it was transported elsewhere for use in revolutionary activities. During the raid, the British soldiers fired upon the rebels with cannon and muskets. Although there were apparently no casualties, these were among the first shots in the American Revolutionary period, occurring approximately five months before the [[Battles of Lexington and Concord]].

The [[United States Constitution]] was ratified by New Hampshire on June 21, 1788, when New Hampshire became the ninth state to do so.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov/education/lessons/constitution-day/ratification.html|title=Observing Constitution Day|website=Archives.gov|access-date=April 7, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190817165833/https://www.archives.gov/education/lessons/constitution-day/ratification.html|archive-date=August 17, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

New Hampshire was a Jacksonian stronghold; the state sent [[Franklin Pierce]] to the White House in the election of 1852. Industrialization took the form of numerous textile mills, which in turn attracted large flows of [[immigrants]] from Quebec (the "French Canadians") and [[Ireland]]. The northern parts of the state produced lumber, and the mountains provided tourist attractions. After 1960, the textile industry collapsed, but the economy rebounded as a center of high technology and as a service provider.

Starting in 1952, New Hampshire gained national and international attention for its [[New Hampshire primary|presidential primary]] held early in every presidential election year. It immediately became the most important testing grounds for candidates for the Republican and Democratic nominations. The media gave New Hampshire and [[Iowa]] about half of all the attention paid to all states in the primary process, magnifying the state's decision powers and spurring repeated efforts by out-of-state politicians to change the rules.

The [[United States Census Bureau]] estimates the population of New Hampshire was 1,359,711 on July 1, 2019, a 3.28% increase since the [[2010 United States Census]].<ref name="PopEstUS"/> The [[center of population]] of New Hampshire is in [[Merrimack County, New Hampshire|Merrimack County]], in the town of [[Pembroke, New Hampshire|Pembroke]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Population and Population Centers by State: 2000 |publisher=United States Census Bureau |access-date=December 5, 2008 |url = https://www.census.gov/geo/www/cenpop/statecenters.txt |url-status=dead |archive-url = http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20080918020344/http://www.census.gov/geo/www/cenpop/statecenters.txt |archive-date=September 18, 2008 }}</ref> The center of population has moved south {{convert|12|mi}} since 1950,<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.nh.gov/oep/programs/DataCenter/Geography/documents/popcenter.pdf |title=Population Center of New Hampshire, 1950–2000 |date=October 2007 |publisher=NH Office of Energy and Planning |access-date=September 10, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080724022314/http://www.nh.gov/oep/programs/DataCenter/Geography/documents/popcenter.pdf |archive-date=July 24, 2008 }}</ref> a reflection of the fact the state's fastest growth has been along its southern border, which is within commuting range of Boston and other Massachusetts cities.

The most densely populated areas generally lie within {{convert|50|mi|0}} of the Massachusetts border, and are concentrated in two areas: along the [[Merrimack River Valley]] running from [[Concord, New Hampshire|Concord]] to [[Nashua, New Hampshire|Nashua]], and in the [[Seacoast Region (New Hampshire)|Seacoast Region]] along an axis stretching from [[Rochester, New Hampshire|Rochester]] to [[Portsmouth, New Hampshire|Portsmouth]]. Outside of those two regions, only one community, the city of [[Keene, New Hampshire|Keene]], has a population over 20,000. The four counties covering these two areas account for 72% of the state population, and one ([[Hillsborough County, New Hampshire|Hillsborough]]) has nearly 30% of the state population, as well as the two most populous communities, Manchester and Nashua. The northern portion of the state is very sparsely populated: the largest county by area, [[Coos County, New Hampshire|Coos]], covers the northern one-fourth of the state and has only around 31,000 people, about a third of whom live in a single community ([[Berlin, New Hampshire|Berlin]]). The trends over the past several decades have been for the population to shift southward, as many northern communities lack the economic base to maintain their populations, while southern communities have been absorbed by the [[Greater Boston]] metropolis.

New Hampshire experienced a major shift in its economic base during the 20th century. Historically, the base was composed of traditional New England textiles, shoe making, and small machine shops, drawing upon low-wage labor from nearby small farms and from parts of Quebec. Today, of the state's total manufacturing dollar value, these sectors contribute only two percent for textiles, two percent for leather goods, and nine percent for machining.<ref>U.S. Economic Census for 1997, Manufacturing, New Hampshire</ref> They experienced a sharp decline due to obsolete plants and the lure of cheaper wages in the [[Southern United States]].

New Hampshire today has a broad-based and growing economy, with a state GDP growth rate of 2.2% in 2018.<ref name=":0" /> The state's largest economic sectors in 2018, based on contribution to GDP, are: 15% real estate and rental and leasing; 13% [[professional services|professional business services]]; 12% manufacturing; 10% government and government services; and 9% health care and social services.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://apps.bea.gov/itable/iTable.cfm?ReqID=70&step=1#reqid=70&step=1&isuri=1|title=Bureau of Economic Analysis—Gross Domestic Product by State|date=May 1, 2019|access-date=June 18, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181023080037/https://apps.bea.gov/itable/iTable.cfm?ReqID=70&step=1#reqid=70&step=1&isuri=1|archive-date=October 23, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

The state's [[budget]] in FY2018 was $5.97{{nbs}}billion, including $1.79{{nbs}}billion in federal funds.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/LBA/budget/operating_budgets/2018_2019/Final/HB%20144%20Adopted%206-22-17.pdf |title=FY 2017 and FY2018 Budget |date=June 22, 2017|website=New Hampshire General Court|access-date=June 13, 2019}}</ref> The issue of taxation is controversial in New Hampshire, which has a [[property tax]] (subject to municipal control) but no broad [[sales tax]] or income tax. The state does have narrower taxes on meals, lodging, vehicles, business and investment income, and tolls on state roads. 

According to the [[Energy Information Administration]], New Hampshire's energy consumption and per capita energy consumption are among the lowest in the country. The [[Seabrook Station Nuclear Power Plant]], near Portsmouth, is the largest nuclear reactor in New England and provided 57% of New Hampshire's electricity generation and 27% of its electricity consumption in 2017. In 2016 and 2017, New Hampshire obtained more of its electricity generation from wind power than coal-fired power plants. Approximately 32% of New Hampshire's electricity consumption came from renewable resources (including [[Nuclear power in the United States|nuclear]], [[Hydroelectricity|hydroelectric]], [[Wind power|wind]], and other [[Renewable energy in the United States|renewable resources]]). New Hampshire was a net exporter of electricity, exporting {{convert|63|e12BTU|TWh|lk=on}}.<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|url=https://www.eia.gov/state/?sid=NH#tabs-1|title=New Hampshire—State Energy Profile Overview—U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA)|website=www.eia.gov|access-date=June 18, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190615221433/https://www.eia.gov/state/?sid=NH#tabs-1|archive-date=June 15, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

New Hampshire's residential electricity use is low compared with the national average, in part because demand for air conditioning is low during the generally mild summer months and because few households use electricity as their primary energy source for home heating. Nearly half of New Hampshire households use [[fuel oil]] for winter heating, which is one of the largest shares in the United States. New Hampshire has potential for renewable energies like wind power, hydroelectricity, and [[wood fuel]].<ref name=":2" />

The state has no general sales tax and no personal [[state income tax]] (the state does tax, at a five percent rate, income from dividends and interest), and the legislature has exercised fiscal restraint. Efforts to diversify the state's general economy have been ongoing.

New Hampshire's lack of a broad-based tax system has resulted in the state's local communities having some of the nation's highest property taxes. However, the state's overall tax burden is relatively low; in 2010 New Hampshire ranked 44th highest among states in combined average state and local tax burden.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.taxfoundation.org/taxdata/show/468.html |title=New Hampshire's State and Local Tax Burden, 1970–2006 |publisher=The Tax Foundation |date=August 7, 2008 |accessdate=February 18, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120512110530/http://www.taxfoundation.org/taxdata/show/468.html |archive-date=May 12, 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref>

==Law and government==

{{Main|Government of New Hampshire}}
[[File:Concord New Hampshire state house 20041229.jpg|thumb|The [[New Hampshire State House]] in [[Concord, New Hampshire|Concord]]]]

The governor of New Hampshire, since January 5, 2017, is [[Chris Sununu]] (Republican). New Hampshire's two U.S. senators are [[Jeanne Shaheen]] and [[Maggie Hassan]] (both Democrats), both of whom are former governors. New Hampshire's two U.S. representatives as of January 2019 are [[Chris Pappas (politician)|Chris Pappas]] and [[Ann McLane Kuster]] (both Democrats).

New Hampshire is an [[alcoholic beverage control state]], and through the [[New Hampshire Liquor Commission|State Liquor Commission]] it takes in $100{{nbs}}million from the sale and distribution of liquor.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://admin.state.nh.us/accounting/FY%2005/Monthly%20Rev%20June-05%20Cash%20Basis%20Unaud.pdf |title=State of New Hampshire Monthly Revenue Focus (FY 2005) |publisher=NH Department of Administrative Services |accessdate=February 3, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811040853/http://admin.state.nh.us/accounting/FY%2005/Monthly%20Rev%20June-05%20Cash%20Basis%20Unaud.pdf |archive-date=August 11, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

New Hampshire is the only state in the U.S. that does not require adults to wear seat belts in their vehicles. It is one of three states that have no mandatory helmet law. 

===Governing documents===

{{Main|Law of New Hampshire}}

The [[New Hampshire State Constitution]] of 1783 is the supreme law of the state, followed by the [[New Hampshire Revised Statutes Annotated]] and the [[New Hampshire Code of Administrative Rules]]. These are roughly analogous to the federal [[United States Constitution]], [[United States Code]] and [[Code of Federal Regulations]] respectively.

===Branches of government===

New Hampshire has a bifurcated executive branch, consisting of the governor and a five-member [[Executive Council of New Hampshire|executive council]] which votes on state contracts worth more than $5,000 and "advises and consents" to the governor's nominations to major state positions such as department heads and all judgeships and [[pardon]] requests. New Hampshire does not have a [[lieutenant governor (United States)#New Hampshire|lieutenant governor]]; the Senate president serves as "acting governor" whenever the governor is unable to perform the duties.

The legislature is called the [[New Hampshire General Court|General Court]]. It consists of the [[New Hampshire House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] and the [[New Hampshire Senate|Senate]]. There are 400 representatives, making it one of the largest elected bodies in the English-speaking world,<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/house/members/memberlookup.aspx |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070815211306/http://gencourt.state.nh.us/house/members/memberlookup.aspx |url-status=dead |archive-date=August 15, 2007 |title="House Fast Fact", New Hampshire House of Representatives |publisher=New Hampshire General Court |website=Gencourt.state.nh.us |access-date=July 31, 2010 }}</ref> and 24 senators. Legislators are paid a nominal salary of $200 per year, the lowest in the U.S. by far, thus most are effectively volunteers, nearly half of which are [[retirement|retirees]]. (For details, see the article on [[Government of New Hampshire#Legislative Branch|Government of New Hampshire]].)

The state's sole appellate court is the [[New Hampshire Supreme Court]]. The [[New Hampshire Superior Court|Superior Court]] is the court of general jurisdiction and the only court which provides for jury trials in [[civil law (common law)|civil]] or [[criminal law|criminal]] cases. The other state courts are the [[New Hampshire Probate Court|Probate Court]], [[New Hampshire District Court|District Court]], and the [[New Hampshire Family Division|Family Division]].

===Local government===

New Hampshire has [[List of counties in New Hampshire|10 counties]] and [[List of cities and towns in New Hampshire|234 cities and towns]].

New Hampshire is a [[John Forrest Dillon|"Dillon Rule"]] state, meaning the state retains all powers not specifically granted to municipalities. Even so, the legislature strongly favors local control, particularly with regard to land use regulations. New Hampshire municipalities are classified as [[New England town|towns]] or cities, which differ primarily by the form of government. Most towns generally operate on the [[town meeting]] form of government, where the registered voters in the town act as the town legislature, and a [[board of selectmen]] acts as the executive of the town. Larger towns and the state's thirteen cities operate either on a [[Council–manager government|council–manager]] or [[Mayor–council government|council–mayor]] form of government. There is no difference, from the state government's point of view, between towns and cities besides the form of government. All state-level statutes treat all municipalities identically.

New Hampshire has a small number of [[unincorporated area]]s that are titled as grants, locations, purchases, or townships. These locations have limited to no self-government, and services are generally provided for them by neighboring towns or the county or state where needed. As of the 2000 census, there were 25 of these left in New Hampshire, accounting for a total population of 173 people ({{as of|2000|lc=y}}); several were entirely depopulated. All but two of these unincorporated areas are in [[Coos County, New Hampshire|Coos County]].

===Politics===

{{Main|Politics of New Hampshire}}

The [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] and the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] are the two largest parties in the state. A plurality of voters are registered as undeclared, and can choose either ballot in the primary and then regain their undeclared status after voting.<ref>{{cite web |url = https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/election/iowa-newhampshire/independents.html |title=Independents Become Largest Voting Bloc in New Hampshire |access-date=December 29, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080908100552/https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/election/iowa-newhampshire/independents.html |archive-date=September 8, 2008 }}</ref> The [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]] had official party status from 1990 to 1996. There is also a program known as the [[Free State Project]] with the goal of turning New Hampshire into a libertarian stronghold by suggesting that libertarians move there so they can concentrate their power. The [[Libertarian Party of New Hampshire|Libertarian Party]] regained ballot access after the 2016 election because the gubernatorial candidate received more than four percent of the vote.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.concordmonitor.com/libertarian-part-ballot-access-5973160| title=Libertarian Party likely on N.H. ballots by 2018| last1=Brooks| first1=David| work=Concord Monitor| date=November 11, 2016| access-date=December 9, 2016| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161203123934/http://www.concordmonitor.com/libertarian-part-ballot-access-5973160| archive-date=December 3, 2016| url-status=live}}</ref>

As of February 5, 2016, there were 882,959 registered voters, of whom 389,472 (44.1%) did not declare a political party affiliation, 262,111 (29.7%) were Republican, and 231,376 (26.2%) were Democratic.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sos.nh.gov/2016ElecInfo.aspx |title=2016 Election Information |publisher=NH Secretary of State |date=February 5, 2016 |accessdate=February 8, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160208213927/http://sos.nh.gov/2016ElecInfo.aspx |archive-date=February 8, 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref>

====New Hampshire primary====

[[File:Alumni Hall 1889 Sun.jpg|thumb|[[Saint Anselm College]] has held several national debates on campus.]]

New Hampshire is internationally known for the [[New Hampshire primary]], the first [[U.S. presidential primary|primary]] in the quadrennial American presidential election cycle. State law requires that the Secretary of State schedule this election at least one week before any "similar event". However, the [[Iowa caucus]] has preceded the New Hampshire primary. This primary, as the nation's first contest that uses the same procedure as the general election, draws more attention than those in other states, and it has been decisive in shaping the national contest.

State law permits a town with fewer than 100 residents to open its polls at midnight, and close when all registered citizens have cast their ballots. As such, the communities of [[Dixville Notch, New Hampshire|Dixville Notch]] in [[Coos County, New Hampshire|Coos County]] and [[Hart's Location, New Hampshire|Hart's Location]] in [[Carroll County, New Hampshire|Carroll County]], among others, have chosen to implement these provisions. Dixville Notch and Hart's Location are traditionally the first places in both New Hampshire and the U.S. to vote in presidential primaries and elections.

Nominations for all other partisan offices are decided in a separate [[primary election]]. In Presidential election cycles, this is the second primary election held in New Hampshire.

[[Saint Anselm College]] in [[Goffstown, New Hampshire|Goffstown]] has become a popular campaign spot for politicians as well as several national presidential debates because of its proximity to [[Manchester-Boston Regional Airport]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.saintanselmcollege.net/category/politics/face-the-nation/|title=CBS's Face the Nation : Saint Anselm College|date=November 13, 2008|accessdate=September 4, 2017|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081113151947/http://blogs.saintanselmcollege.net/category/politics/face-the-nation/|archivedate=November 13, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.anselm.edu/news+and+events/college+news/news/2007-11-29-primarydebates.htm|title=Saint Anselm College—Saint Anselm to Host ABC Debates in Dana Center|date=May 11, 2008|accessdate=September 4, 2017|url-status=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511173202/http://www.anselm.edu/news+and+events/college+news/news/2007-11-29-primarydebates.htm|archivedate=May 11, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=William Schpero |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/01/07/politics/uwire/main3684304.shtml |title=Candidates Face Off at St. Anselm's College |publisher=[[CBS News]] |date=January 7, 2008 |accessdate=July 31, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101101061337/http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/01/07/politics/uwire/main3684304.shtml |archive-date=November 1, 2010 |url-status=live }}</ref>

====Elections====

{{Main|Elections in New Hampshire}}
{{Further|United States presidential elections in New Hampshire}}
[[File:Dartmouth College campus - Democratic Presidential Candidates Debate 51.jpg|thumb|Dartmouth College before a debate in 2008]]

In the past, New Hampshire has often voted Republican. Between 1856 and 1988, New Hampshire cast its electoral votes for the Democratic presidential ticket six times: [[Woodrow Wilson]] (twice), [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] (three times), and [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] (once).

Beginning in 1992, New Hampshire became a [[swing state]] in both national and local elections. The state supported Democrats [[Bill Clinton]] in 1992 and 1996, [[John Kerry]] in 2004, [[Barack Obama]] in 2008 and 2012, and [[Hillary Clinton]] in 2016. It was the only state in the country to switch from supporting Republican [[George W. Bush]] in the [[2000 United States presidential election|2000 election]] to supporting his Democratic challenger in the [[2004 United States presidential election|2004 election]], when [[John Kerry]], a senator from neighboring Massachusetts, won the state. [[Donald Trump]] very narrowly lost the state in 2016.

The Democrats dominated elections in New Hampshire in 2006 and 2008. In 2006, Democrats won both congressional seats (electing [[Carol Shea-Porter]] in the first district and [[Paul Hodes]] in the second), re-elected Governor [[John Lynch (New Hampshire)|John Lynch]], and gained a majority on the Executive Council and in both houses for the first time since 1911. Democrats had not held both the legislature and the governorship since 1874.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/masshightech/stories/2006/12/25/focus2.html |title=Storm of change sweeps through N.H.

In 2008, Democrats retained their majorities, governorship, and Congressional seats; and former governor [[Jeanne Shaheen]] defeated incumbent Republican [[John E. Sununu]] for the U.S. Senate in a rematch of the 2002 contest.

The 2008 elections resulted in women holding a majority, 13 of the 24 seats, in the New Hampshire Senate, a first for any legislative body in the United States.<ref>Senate President Sylvia Larsen, quoted in "Women make up majority in state Senate," ''[[New Hampshire Union Leader]]'', November 6, 2008.</ref>

In the 2010 midterm elections, Republicans made historic gains in New Hampshire, capturing veto-proof majorities in the state legislature, taking all five seats in the Executive Council, electing a new U.S. senator, [[Kelly Ayotte]], winning both U.S. House seats, and reducing the margin of victory of incumbent Governor [[John Lynch (New Hampshire)|John Lynch]] compared to his 2006 and 2008 landslide wins.

In the 2012 state legislative elections, Democrats took back the [[New Hampshire House of Representatives]] and narrowed the Republican majority in the [[New Hampshire Senate]] to 13–11.<ref>{{cite news |first=Sean |last=Sullivan |title=New Hampshire's Democratic wave, explained |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2012/11/09/new-hampshires-democratic-wave-explained/ |location=Washington, DC |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=November 9, 2012 |access-date=September 2, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150514011248/http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2012/11/09/new-hampshires-democratic-wave-explained/ |archive-date=May 14, 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref> In 2012, New Hampshire became the first state in U.S. history to elect an all-female federal delegation: Democratic Congresswomen [[Carol Shea-Porter]] of [[New Hampshire's 1st congressional district|Congressional District 1]] and [[Ann McLane Kuster]] of [[New Hampshire's 2nd congressional district|Congressional District 2]] accompanied U.S. Senators [[Jeanne Shaheen]] and [[Kelly Ayotte]] in 2013. Further, the state elected its second female governor: Democrat [[Maggie Hassan]].

In the 2014 elections, Republicans retook the [[New Hampshire House of Representatives]] with a 239–160 majority and expanded their majority in the [[New Hampshire Senate]] to 14 of the Senate's 24 seats. On the national level, incumbent Democratic Senator [[Jeanne Shaheen]] defeated her Republican challenger, former Massachusetts senator [[Scott Brown (politician)|Scott Brown]]. New Hampshire also elected [[Frank Guinta]] (R) for its First Congressional District representative and [[Ann Kuster]] (D) for its Second Congressional District representative.

In the 2016 elections, Republicans held the [[New Hampshire House of Representatives]] with a majority of 220–175, and held onto their 14 seats in the [[New Hampshire Senate]]. In the gubernatorial race, retiring Governor [[Maggie Hassan]] was succeeded by Republican [[Chris Sununu]], who defeated Democratic nominee [[Colin Van Ostern]]. Sununu became the state's first Republican governor since [[Craig Benson]], who left office in 2005 following defeat by [[John Lynch (New Hampshire)|John Lynch]]. Republicans control the governor's office and both chambers of the state legislature, a governing trifecta in which the Republicans have full governing power.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/11/11/us/elections/state-legislature-change-in-control.html|title=In a Further Blow to Democrats, Republicans Increase Their Hold on State Governments|first1=K. k Rebecca Lai, Jasmine C.|last1=Lee|first2=Karl|last2=Russell|date=November 11, 2016|website=Nytimes.com|accessdate=September 4, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170827162124/https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/11/11/us/elections/state-legislature-change-in-control.html|archive-date=August 27, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> In the presidential race, the state voted for the Democratic nominee, former [[Secretary of State]] [[Hillary Clinton]] over the Republican nominee, Donald Trump, by a margin of 2,736 votes, or 0.3%, one of the closest results the state has ever seen in a presidential race, while Libertarian nominee [[Gary Johnson]] received 4.12% of the vote. The Democrats also won a competitive race in the Second Congressional District, as well as a competitive senate race. New Hampshire's congressional delegation currently consists of exclusively Democrats. In the [[116th United States Congress]], it is one of only eight states with an entirely Democratic delegation, five of which are in New England (the others are Delaware, Hawaii, and New Mexico).

==Transportation==
===Highways===

{{Main|New Hampshire Highway System}}

New Hampshire has a well-maintained, well-signed network of [[Interstate highways]], U.S. highways, and state highways. State highway markers still depict the [[Old Man of the Mountain]] despite that rock formation's demise in 2003. Several route numbers align with the same route numbers in neighboring states. State highway numbering is arbitrary, with no overall system as with U.S. and Interstate systems. Major routes include:
* [[File:I-89.svg|20px]] [[Interstate 89]] runs northwest from near [[Concord, New Hampshire|Concord]] to [[Lebanon, New Hampshire|Lebanon]] on the [[Vermont]] border.
* [[File:I-93.svg|20px]] [[Interstate 93]] is the main Interstate highway in New Hampshire and runs north from [[Salem, New Hampshire|Salem]] (on the Massachusetts border) to [[Littleton, New Hampshire|Littleton]] (on the Vermont border). I-93 connects the more densely populated southern part of the state to the Lakes Region and the White Mountains further to the north.
* [[File:I-95.svg|20px]] [[Interstate 95]] runs north–south briefly along New Hampshire's seacoast to serve the city of [[Portsmouth, New Hampshire|Portsmouth]], before entering [[Maine]]
* [[File:US 1.svg|20px]] [[U.S. Route 1]] runs north–south briefly along New Hampshire's seacoast to the east of and paralleling I-95.
* [[File:US 2.svg|20px]] [[U.S. Route 2]] runs east–west through [[Coos County, New Hampshire|Coos County]] from Maine, intersecting [[New Hampshire Route 16|Route 16]], skirting the [[White Mountain National Forest]] passing through [[Jefferson, New Hampshire|Jefferson]] and into Vermont.
* [[File:US 3.svg|20px]] [[U.S. Route 3]] is the longest numbered route in the state, and the only one to run completely through the state from the Massachusetts border to the Canada–U.S. border. It generally parallels [[Interstate 93]]. South of Manchester, it takes a more westerly route through [[Nashua, New Hampshire|Nashua]]. North of Franconia Notch, U.S.{{nbs}}3 takes a more easterly route, before terminating at the Canada–U.S. border.
* [[File:US 4.svg|20px]] [[U.S. Route 4]] terminates at the [[Portsmouth Traffic Circle]] and runs east–west across the southern part of the state connecting [[Durham, New Hampshire|Durham]], Concord, [[Boscawen, New Hampshire|Boscawen]] and Lebanon.
* [[File:NH Route 16.svg|20px]] [[New Hampshire Route 16]] is a major north–south highway in the eastern part of the state that generally parallels the border with [[Maine]], eventually entering Maine as Maine Route 16. The southernmost portion of NH 16 is a four-lane freeway, co-signed with U.S. Route{{nbs}}4.
* [[File:NH Route 101.svg|20px]] [[New Hampshire Route 101]] is a major east–west highway in the southern part of the state that connects [[Keene, New Hampshire|Keene]] with [[Manchester, New Hampshire|Manchester]] and the Seacoast region. East of Manchester, NH 101 is a four-lane, limited access highway that runs to [[Hampton Beach, New Hampshire|Hampton Beach]] and I-95.

===Air===

{{Main list|List of airports in New Hampshire}}

New Hampshire has 25 public-use airports, three with some scheduled commercial passenger service. The busiest airport by number of passengers handled is [[Manchester-Boston Regional Airport]] in Manchester and [[Londonderry, New Hampshire|Londonderry]], which serves the [[Greater Boston]] metropolitan area.
