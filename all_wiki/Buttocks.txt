The '''buttocks''' (singular: '''buttock''') are two rounded portions of the exterior anatomy of most [[mammals]], located on the posterior of the pelvic region. In humans, the buttocks are located between the lower back and the [[perineum]]. They are composed of a layer of exterior skin and  underlying [[subcutaneous tissue|subcutaneous]] fat superimposed on a left and right [[gluteus maximus muscle|gluteus maximus]] and [[gluteus medius muscle]]s. The two gluteus maximus muscles are the largest muscles in the  human body. They are responsible for achieving the upright posture when the body is bent at the waist; maintaining the body in the upright posture by keeping the hip joints extended; and propelling the body forward via further leg (hip) extension when walking or running.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.refrence.com/science/gluteus-maximus-543e8854558908e7 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2019-05-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190513141554/http://www.refrence.com/science/gluteus-maximus-543e8854558908e7 |archive-date=2019-05-13 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In the seated position, the buttocks bear the weight of the upper body and take that weight off the feet.

There are several connotations of buttocks in art, fashion, culture and humor. The English language is replete with many popular synonyms that range from polite colloquialisms ("posterior", "backside" or "bottom") to vulgar slang ([[wikt:arse#English|"arse,"]] [[wikt:ass#Etymology 2|"ass,"]] [[wikt:bum#English|"bum,"]] [[wikt:butt#English|"butt,"]] [[wikt:booty#Noun|"booty,"]] [[wikt:prat#Etymology 2|"prat"]]).

==Anatomy==
The buttocks are formed by the masses of the gluteal muscles or "glutes" (the [[gluteus maximus muscle]] and the [[gluteus medius muscle]]) superimposed by a layer of [[adipose tissue|fat]]. The superior aspect of the buttock ends at the [[iliac crest]], and the lower aspect is outlined by the [[horizontal gluteal crease]]. The gluteus maximus has two insertion points: {{Frac|1|3}} superior portion of the [[linea aspera]] of the [[femur]], and the superior portion of the iliotibial tractus. The masses of the gluteus maximus muscle are separated by an intermediate [[intergluteal cleft]] or "crack" in which the [[Human anus|anus]] is situated.

The buttocks allow primates to sit upright without needing to rest their weight on their feet as [[quadruped|four-legged animals]] do. Females of certain species of [[baboon]] have red buttocks that blush to attract males. In the case of humans, females tend to have proportionally wider and thicker buttocks due to higher [[subcutaneous fat]] and proportionally wider [[hip]]s. In humans they also have a role in propelling the body in a forward motion and aiding bowel movement.<ref>Foundations of Osteopathic Medicine, Page 586, Anthony G. Chila - 2010</ref><ref>Recent Advances in Pediatrics, 2013 Suraj Gupte, p 141</ref>

Some [[baboon]]s and all [[gibbon]]s, though otherwise [[fur]]-covered, have characteristic naked [[Callosity|callosities]] on their buttocks. While human children generally have smooth buttocks, mature males and females have varying degrees of hair growth, as on other parts of their body. Females may have hair growth in the gluteal cleft (including around the anus), sometimes extending laterally onto the lower aspect of the cheeks. Males may have hair growth over some or all of the buttocks.

===Connotations===
{{Main|Cultural history of the buttocks}}
[[Image:mooning.jpg|thumb|Students at [[Stanford University]] conduct a "mass-[[mooning]]" in May 1995]]

The English word of [[Greek language|Greek]] origin "[[wiktionary:callipygian|callipygian]]" indicates someone who has beautiful buttocks.
    
Depending on the context, exposure of the buttocks in non-intimate situations can cause feelings of embarrassment or humiliation, and embarrassment or amusement in an onlooker (see [[Debagging|pantsing]]). Willfully exposing one's own [[naked|bare]] buttocks as a protest, a provocation, or just for fun is called [[mooning]].

In many punitive traditions, the buttocks are a common target for [[corporal punishment]], which can be meted out with no risk of long-term physical harm compared with the dangers of applying it to other parts of the body, such as the hands, which could easily be damaged.<ref>Zeno Chicarilli, M.D. et al. [http://nospank.net/hands.htm "Corporal Punishment to Children's Hands: A Statement by Medical Authorities as to the Risks"]. NoSpank.net. 3 January 2002.</ref> Within the Victorian school system in England, the buttocks have been described as "the place provided by nature" for this purpose.<ref name="times18940322"/> A modern-day example can be seen in some Southeast Asian countries, such as Singapore. [[Caning in Singapore]] is widely used as a form of [[judicial corporal punishment]], with male convicts being sentenced to a [[caning]] on their bare buttocks.

In Western and some other cultures, many comedians, writers and others rely on the buttocks as a source of amusement, camaraderie and fun. There are numerous colloquial terms for the buttocks.

In [[American English]], phrases use the buttocks or synonyms (especially "butt" and "ass") as a [[synecdoche]] or [[pars pro toto]] for a whole person, often with a negative connotation. For example, terminating an employee may be described as "firing his ass". One might say "move your ass" or "haul ass" as an exhortation to greater haste or urgency. Expressed as a function of punishment, defeat or assault becomes "kicking one's ass". Such phrases also may suggest a person's characteristics, e.g. difficult people are termed "hard asses". In America an annoying person or any source of frustration may be termed "a pain in the ass" (a synonym for "a pain in the neck"). People deemed excessively puritanical or proper may be termed "tight asses" (in Australia and New Zealand, "tight arse" refers to someone who is excessively miserly).

Certain physical dispositions of the buttocks—particularly size—are sometimes identified, controversially, as a racial characteristic (see [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]]). A famous example was the case of [[Saartjie Baartman]], the so-called "Hottentot Venus".

The [[Latin]] name for the buttocks is ''nates'' (English pronunciation {{IPAc-en|ˈ|n|eɪ|t|iː|z}} {{respell|NAY|teez}},<ref>{{cite web|title=nates - Definitions from Dictionary.com|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=nates}}</ref> classical pronunciation ''nătes'' {{IPA-la|ˈnateːs|}}<ref>A New Dictionary of the Latin and English Languages, published Ward, Lock & Co., London, 1908</ref>) which is plural; the singular, ''natis'' (buttock), is rarely used. There are many colloquial terms to refer to them, including:

* Backside, posterior, behind and its derivates (hind-quarters, hinder or the childish diminutive "heinie" (US usage only), strictly the whole body behind the hind leg-trunk attachment), rear or [[wikt:rear-end|rear-end]], ''derrière'' (French for "behind")—all strictly positional descriptions, as the inaccurate use of [[rump (animal)|rump]] (as in 'rump roast', after a 'hot' spanking), thighs, upper legs; analogous are:
** [[Aft]], [[stern]] and [[poop deck|poop]], naval in origin; in  nautical jargon, buttocks also designates the aftermost portion of a [[Hull (watercraft)|hull]] above the [[water line]] and in front of the rudder, merging with the run below the water line
** [[Caboose]], originally a ship's galley in wooden cabin on deck; also the "rear end" car of a freight train, considered a cute synonym suitable for any audience
** Bottom (and the shortening "bot" as well as childish diminutives "bottie" or "botty"), but the use of similar-sounding "[[booty call|booty]]" or "bootie" may be related.
** [[Tail]] (strictly anatomically a [[zoomorphism]], humans only have a [[tail-bone]], yet the illogical "tail feather" was popularized by musicians. When used to refer to a woman or to women in general, the term is derogatory; also used for the even more sensual [[phallus]]) and ''tail-end''
** Trunk, in American English, particularly when describing large buttocks: "junk in the trunk"
* [[Apple]], referring to the similar shape of the fruit, derived from the 1970s. Also likened to an upside-down heart, attributed from various, popular ads of the 1970s.
* Arse or ass, [[arsehole]] or [[asshole]], and (butt-)hole: a ''[[pars pro toto]]'' (strictly only the actual body cavity and directly adjoining anal region); also used as an insult for a person. The term arse or ass is [[Old English language|Anglo-Saxon]], and over a thousand years old.
* Badonkadonk: [[onomatopoeia|onomatopoeic]] US slang meaning the voluptuously bouncing, large yet firm buttocks of a woman
*Batty: [[Jamaican Patois]], commonly used in certain communities within the UK and Canada.
* Booty, US slang, used in the popular slang expression "[[booty call]]".  It has been suggested that the word derives from a [[Bambara language|Bambara]] (West African) word for anus, ''buda''.<ref>Elijah Wald, ''Talking 'Bout Your Mama: The Dozens, snaps, and the deep roots of Rap'', Oxford University Press, 2012, p.206</ref>
* Breech, a metaphorical sense derived from on older form of the garment [[breeches]] (as the French ''culotte'' meaning pantoloons, via ''cul'' from Latin ''culus'' "butt"), so 'bare breech' means without breeches, ''i.e.'', trouserless butt
* Bum: in British English, used frequently in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and many other English-speaking Commonwealth countries, also historically in the United States, is a mild often humorous term for buttocks, not necessarily in a vulgar or sexual context: "I've a boil on my bum, thrice as large as my thumb" (''The Judge With The Sore Rump'', [[St. George Tucker]]). A [[bum boy]] is an insulting term for a male homosexual.
* Bumpy: a euphemistic term for the buttocks, used primarily with children
* [[Buns]], from Gaelic ''bun'' "bottom, base", [[mound]]s (cfr. [[Butte (disambiguation)|Butte]], a geographical mound, known since 1805 in American English, from (Old) French ''butte'' "mound, knoll") and orbs—shape-metaphors.
* Bund: derived from [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]]
* Bunda: [[Brazilian Portuguese]] slang for buttocks, from [[Kimbundu]] ''mbunda'', with same meaning.
* Butt: the common term for a pair of buttocks in the US (singular, as one body-part; cognate but neither its root nor an abbreviation), used in everyday speech.
* Cakes: slang word for buttocks
* Can (a container) had an unusual development: the slang meaning "toilet" is recorded c. 1900, said to be a shortening of piss-can, the meaning "buttocks" from c. 1910, and the verb meaning "fire an employee" (to flush=dump?) from 1905.
* [[Cheeks]], a shape-metaphor within human anatomy, but also used in the singular: left cheek and right cheek; sounds particularly naughty because of the homonym and the adjective cheeky, lending themselves to word puns
* Culo: (From [[Spanish language|Spanish]]/[[Italian language|Italian]]) slang, usually meaning a woman's voluptuous, round and firm buttocks. Derived from a term for booty; in Spanish the term is considered vulgar and offensive, but less so in Spain than in Latin America.
* Duffs: Ulster Irish origin
* Dumper sometimes denotes the buttocks, especially when they are large.
* Fanny: a socially acceptable term in print, in Canada and the United States at least, for many years before some of the bolder terms came along; and a subject of jokes, since "Fannie" can be a woman's name, diminutive of "Frances"; however, in [[British English]] ''fanny'' refers to the female genitals or [[vulva]] and is considered vulgar. The figure of a bare-bottomed lass named Fanny is ubiquitous in Provence (the southeast of France) wherever [[pétanque]] is played: traditionally when a player loses 13 to 0 it is said that “il est fanny” (he's fanny), and he has to kiss the bottom of a girl called Fanny; as there is rarely an obliging Fanny, there is always a substitute picture, woodcarving or pottery so that Fanny’s bottom is always available.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.laboulebleue.fr/fr/html/fanny.htm |title=Pétanque.

* Fourth point of contact: in military slang, because of the sequence of textbook [[Parachute landing fall|parachute jump landing]]
* Fundament (literally "foundation", not common in this general sense in English, but for the buttocks since 1297)
* Gand or Gaand: a Hindi derivative
* [[Hams]], like buttocks generally as a plural, after the meat cut from the analogous part of a [[Hog (swine)|hog]] <!-- coexistent, be it anatomically confusing, with the other meaning, as in hamstrings, similar to the [[tendon]]s of the [[muscle]]s in the upper back of the thigh, the [[hamstrings]]; in some cognate languages, e.g. Dutch, the only meaning is the (usual pork) buttock—see http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=ham and http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=ham&searchmode=none-->; ''pressed ham'' refers to mooning against a window; [[brawn]], a singular derived from the Frankish for ham or roast, is also used for both a muscular body part (but either on arms or legs) or boar meat, especially roast
* Hurdies: Scots, origin unknown, also applied to the whole rump
* [[Haunch]]es
* [[Moon]] was a common shape-metaphor for the butt in English since 1756, and the verb ''to moon'' meant 'to expose to (moon)light' since 1601, long before they were combined in US student slang in the verb (al expression) [[mooning]] "to flash the buttocks" in 1968.
* Prat (British English, origin unknown; as in [[Physical comedy|pratfall]], a [[vaudeville|music hall]] term; also a term of abuse for a person)
* Seat (of the trousers; or metaphorically): another long-standing socially acceptable term, referring to the use for sitting—but compare the sarcastic use of [[seat of wisdom]] and similar expressions, such as 'seat of learning', referring to use as target for an 'educational' [[spanking]].
* Sit-upon; has various independent counterparts in other languages, ''e.g.'', Dutch ''zitvlak'' ("sitting plain"), German ''Gesäß''  Italian ''sedere''
* Six; in military terminology, particularly in the [[United States Navy]], it refers to the term "six o'clock", ''i.e.'', a point directly behind the referenced person.
* Tuchis: Yiddish.
* Tush or tushy (from the [[Yiddish]] language "tuchis" or "tochis" meaning "under" or "beneath")
* [[Ultimatum]] (Latin, literally 'the furthest part') was used in slang c.1820s.

===Related terms===
* The word "callipygian" is sometimes used to describe someone with notably attractive buttocks. The term comes from the Greek ''kallipygos'', (first used for the [[Venus Kallipygos]]) which literally means "beautiful buttocks"; the prefix is also a root of "calligraphy" (beautiful writing) and "calliope" (beautiful voice); ''callimammapygian'' means having both beautiful breasts and buttocks.
* Both the English ''(in) tails'' and the Dutch ''billentikker'' ('tapping the buttocks') are ironic terms for very formal coats with a significantly longer tail end as part of festive (especially wedding party) dress
* ''Macropygia'' means 'heaving large buttocks, hindquarter', and occurs in biological species names,
* A ''pygopag(ous)'' (from the Greek ''pygè'' 'buttock' and ''pagein'' 'attached') was a monster in Ancient (Greek) mythology consisting of two bodies joint by common buttocks, now a medical term for [[Siamese twins#Types of conjoined twins|'Siamese' twins]] thus joint back-to-back
* ''[[Pygophilia]]'' is sexual arousal or excitement caused by seeing, playing with or touching the buttocks; people who have strong attraction to buttocks are called ''pygophilists''.
* ''Pygoscopia'' means observing someone's rear; ''pygoscopophobia'' a pathological fear to be its unwilling object
* ''Pygalgia'' is soreness in the buttocks, i.e. a pain in the rump.
* [[Steatopygia]] is a marked accumulation of fat in and around the buttocks.
* ''Uropygial'' in ornithology means situated on or belonging to the ''uropygium'', i.e. the rump of a bird.
* {{anchor|Bubble butt}}"Bubble butt" has at least two connotations, which are at odds with each other: either a small, round and firm pair of buttocks resembling a pair of soap bubbles next to each other, or a large rear end, seemingly about to burst from the strain. In both cases, the term implies an appealing shapeliness about the buttocks.

===Fashion===
[[File:Georges Seurat - A Sunday on La Grande Jatte -- 1884 - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb
|[[George Seurat]]'s 1884 painting ''[[A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte]]'' depicts a woman on the right with a prominent [[bustle]] under her dress.]]
The [[1880s in Western fashion|1880s]] were well known for the fashion trend among women called the [[bustle]], which made even the smallest buttocks appear huge. The popularity of this fashion is shown in the famous [[Georges Seurat]] painting ''[[A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte]]'' in the two women to the far left and right. Like long underwear with the ubiquitous "butt flap" (used to allow baring only the bottom with a simple gesture, as for hygiene), this clothing style was acknowledged in popular media such as cartoons and comics for generations afterward.

More recently, the [[Buttock cleavage|cleavage of the buttocks]] is sometimes exposed by some women, deliberately or accidentally, as fashion dictated trousers be worn lower, as with [[hip-hugger]] pants.

An example of another attitude in an otherwise hardly exhibitionist culture is the Japanese [[fundoshi]].

===In popular culture===

*In 1966 [[Yoko Ono]] made a roughly 90 minute-long experimental film called ''No. 4'', which is colloquially known as ''Bottoms''. It consists of footage of human buttocks in motion while the person walks on a turntable.
*The 1984 [[Heavy metal music]] [[mockumentary]] ''[[This Is Spinal Tap]]'' contained the song "Big Bottom" featuring the lyrics ''Big bottom, big bottom, Talk about bum cakes, my girl's got 'em, Big bottom drive me out of my mind, How could I leave this behind?'' The band performs the song using three simultaneous [[bass guitar]]s, a [[pun]] on the song title, as the bass is often colloquially referred to as the "bottom end" of the rock sound.
*Numerous songs have been released which glorify this body part.  As early as 1961, the American [[Folk music|Folk]] band [[The Limeliters]] recorded the song "Vicki Dougan" [sic], which pays a humorous tribute to the [[pin-up]] star [[Vikki Dougan]] who wore infamously low-cut, backless [[dress]]es. A risque song for the time, the lyrics  mention her "callipygian cleft" by name. Other English-language examples include:

** "[[Peaches (The Stranglers song)|Peaches]]" by [[The Stranglers]] (1977)

*''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine named the 1990s the "Decade of the Butt" because many buttock-related songs were released in that decade.
*In the [[United Kingdom]] there is an annual award given to the [[male]] and [[female]] winners of the [[celebrity]] voted to have the [[Rear of the Year]] for that year.  Past Winners have included [[Sarah Lancashire]] and [[Jane Danson]].
*In 2008, Hong Kong lifestyle retail store [[Goods of Desire|G.O.D.]] collaborated with [[Kee Wah Bakery]] to design [[mooncakes]] for the Chinese [[Mid-autumn festival|Mid-Autumn Festival]].
