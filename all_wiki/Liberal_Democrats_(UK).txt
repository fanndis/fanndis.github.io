The '''Liberal Democrats''' ('''Lib Dems''') are a [[Liberalism|liberal]] [[List of political parties in the United Kingdom|political party]] in the [[United Kingdom]]. The party has 11 [[Member of Parliament (UK)|Members of Parliament]] in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]], 89 members of the [[House of Lords]], five [[Members of the Scottish Parliament]] and one member in both the [[Welsh Parliament]] and the [[London Assembly]]. It formed a [[Conservative–Liberal Democrat coalition agreement|UK coalition government]] with the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] from 2010 to 2015. In [[Devolution|devolved governments]], the Liberal Democrats are in coalition with [[Welsh Labour]] in [[List of Welsh Governments|the devolved Welsh government]], and also served as the junior partner with [[Scottish Labour]] in the [[Scottish Government]] from 1999 to 2007.

In 1981, an [[SDP–Liberal Alliance|electoral alliance]] was established between the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]], a group which descended from the 18th-century [[Whigs (British political party)|Whigs]] and the [[Social Democratic Party (UK)|Social Democratic Party]] (SDP), a splinter group from the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]]. In 1988, the parties merged as the Social and Liberal Democrats, adopting their present name over a year later. Under the leadership of [[Paddy Ashdown]] and later [[Charles Kennedy]], the party grew during the 1990s and 2000s, focusing its campaigns on specific seats and becoming the third-largest party in the House of Commons. Under [[Nick Clegg]]'s leadership, the Liberal Democrats were junior partners in [[David Cameron]]'s [[Cameron–Clegg coalition|Conservative-led coalition government]] in which Clegg served as [[Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Deputy Prime Minister]]. Although it allowed them to implement some of their policies, the coalition damaged the Lib Dems' electoral prospects and it suffered many losses at the [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015 general election]] which relegated them to fourth-largest party in the House of Commons. Under the leaderships of [[Tim Farron]], [[Vince Cable]] and [[Jo Swinson]], it refocused itself as a party [[Pro-Europeanism|opposing]] [[Brexit]]. Since 2015 the party has failed to recapture its pre-coalition successes under Ashdown and Kennedy and a poor performance in the [[2019 United Kingdom general election|2019 general election]] saw Swinson lose her seat.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sloman|first=Peter|date=2020|title=Squeezed Out? The Liberal Democrats and the 2019 General Election|journal=The Political Quarterly|language=en|volume=91|issue=1|pages=35–42|doi=10.1111/1467-923X.12816|issn=1467-923X|doi-access=free}}</ref> 

Positioned in the [[Centrism|centre]] to [[Centre-left politics|centre-left]] of [[British politics]], the Liberal Democrats ideologically draw upon both liberalism and [[social democracy]]. Different factions have dominated the party at different times, each with its own ideological bent, some leaning towards the centre-left and others the centre. The party calls for constitutional reform, including a change from the [[first-past-the-post voting]] system to [[proportional representation]]. Emphasising stronger protections for [[civil liberties]], the party promotes [[Social liberalism|socially liberal]] approaches to issues like [[LGBT rights]], [[Drug liberalization|drug liberalisation]], [[Education in the United Kingdom|education policy]] and [[criminal justice]]. It favours a [[market economy|market-based economy]] supplemented with [[Welfare|social welfare]] spending. The party is [[Internationalism (politics)|internationalist]] and [[Pro-Europeanism|pro-European]], it supported the [[People's Vote]] for the continued UK membership of the [[European Union]] and greater [[European integration]], previously calling for adoption of the [[euro]] currency. The Lib Dems have promoted further environmental protections and opposed some UK military ventures like the [[Iraq War]].

The Liberal Democrats are historically strongest in northern Scotland, south-west London, south-west England and mid-Wales. Membership is primarily middle-class and more university educated than most UK parties. The party's partner in Northern Ireland is the [[Alliance Party of Northern Ireland]]. Internationally, the party is a member of the [[Liberal International]] and the [[Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Party]], with its MEPs formerly affiliated to the [[Renew Europe]] group in the European Parliament, until the UK left the EU on 31 January 2020.

== History ==
=== Origins (1977–1983) ===
The [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] had existed in different forms for over 300 years.{{sfn|Whiteley|Seyd|Billinghurst|2006|p=3}} During the 19th and early 20th century, it had been one of the United Kingdom's two dominant political parties, along with the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]]. Following [[World War I]], it was pushed into third place by the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] and underwent a gradual decline throughout the rest of the 20th century.{{sfn|Whiteley|Seyd|Billinghurst|2006|p=4}} In the 1970s, the Liberal leader [[David Steel]] began contemplating how an alliance with other parties could return it to political power.{{sfn|Cook|2010|p=163}} In 1977, he formed a pact with Labour Prime Minister [[James Callaghan]] to back Callaghan's government in a [[Motions of no confidence in the United Kingdom|motion of no confidence]]. This angered many Liberals and damaged them electorally.{{sfn|Cook|2010|pp=163–165}} In the [[1979 United Kingdom general election|1979 general election]], the Liberals lost three seats in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]]; the Conservatives, led by [[Margaret Thatcher]], won the election.{{sfn|Cook|2010|pp=166–167}}

Within Labour, many centrists were uncomfortable with the growing influence of the [[hard left]], who were calling for the UK to leave the [[European Economic Community]] and unilaterally disarm as a [[List of states with nuclear weapons|nuclear power]]. In January 1981, four senior Labour MPs—[[Bill Rodgers, Baron Rodgers of Quarry Bank|Bill Rodgers]], [[Shirley Williams]], [[Roy Jenkins]], and [[David Owen]], known as the "[[Gang of Four (SDP)|Gang of Four]]"—issued the [[Limehouse Declaration]] in which they announced their split from Labour. This led to the formal launch of the [[Social Democratic Party (UK)|Social Democratic Party]] (SDP) in March.{{sfn|Cook|2010|pp=167–168}} One of its first decisions was to negotiate an electoral arrangement with the Liberals, facilitated between Jenkins, who was the first SDP leader, and Steel.{{sfn|Cook|2010|p=168}}

The [[SDP–Liberal Alliance|new alliance]] initially did well in opinion polls.{{sfn|Cook|2010|pp=168–169}} The SDP and Liberals agreed to contest alternating by-elections; between 1981 and 1982, the SDP came close in [[1981 Warrington by-election|Warrington]] and won [[1981 Crosby by-election|Crosby]] and [[1982 Glasgow Hillhead by-election|Glasgow Hillhead]].{{sfn|Cook|2010|pp=169–170}} At the [[1983 United Kingdom general election|1983 general election]], the Liberals gained five additional seats although the SDP lost many that they had previously inherited from Labour.{{sfn|Cook|2010|pp=171–172}} After the 1983 election, Owen replaced Jenkins as head of the SDP.{{sfn|Cook|2010|p=175}} Several gains were made in subsequent by-elections: the SDP won in [[1984 Portsmouth South by-election|Portsmouth South]] and [[1987 Greenwich by-election|Greenwich]] and the Liberals in [[1985 Brecon and Radnor by-election|Brecon and Radnor]] and [[1986 Ryedale by-election|Ryedale]].{{sfn|Cook|2010|pp=177–182}}

=== Foundation and early years (1987–1992) ===
[[File:Social and Liberal Democrats logo.png|thumb|upright|The initial logo used by the Social and Liberal Democrats after their 1988 foundation]]
Both parties lost seats in the [[1987 United Kingdom general election|1987 general election]].{{sfn|Cook|2010|p=186–187}} In the wake of this, Steel called for the SDP and Liberals to merge into a single party.{{sfnm|1a1=Taylor|1y=2007|1p=22|2a1=Cook|2y=2010|2p=188}} At the grassroots, various local constituency groups had already ''de facto'' merged.{{sfn|Cook|2010|p=188}} In the SDP, Jenkins, Rodgers, Williams, and the MP [[Charles Kennedy]] supported the idea; Owen and the MPs [[Rosie Barnes]] and [[John Cartwright (British politician)|John Cartwright]] opposed it.{{sfn|Cook|2010|pp=188–189}} The SDP's membership was balloted on the idea: after it produced 57.4% in favour of the merger, Owen resigned as leader, to be replaced by [[Bob Maclennan]].{{sfnm|1a1=Taylor|1y=2007|1p=22|2a1=Cook|2y=2010|2pp=188–190}} A Liberal conference in September found delegates providing a landslide majority for the merger.{{sfn|Cook|2010|p=191}} Formal negotiations launched that month and in December it produced a draft constitution for the new party.{{sfn|Cook|2010|p=192}} In 1988, Liberal and SDP meetings both produced majorities for the merger;{{sfn|Cook|2010|pp=197–198}} finally, the memberships of both parties were balloted and both produced support for unification.{{sfn|Cook|2010|p=199}} Those in both parties opposed to unification split to form their own breakaway groups.{{sfnm|1a1=Whiteley|1a2=Seyd|1a3=Billinghurst|1y=2006|1p=45|2a1=Taylor|2y=2007|2p=23}}

The Social and Liberal Democrats were formally launched on 3 March 1988.{{sfn|Cook|2010|p=200}} Steel and Maclennan initially became joint interim leaders.{{sfnm|1a1=Taylor|1y=2007|1p=23|2a1=Cook|2y=2010|2p=200}} At the start, it claimed 19 MPs, 3,500 local councillors, and 100,000 members.{{sfn|Cook|2010|p=200}} In its first leadership election, [[Paddy Ashdown]] defeated [[Alan Beith]].{{sfn|Cook|2010|p=201}} Ashdown saw the Liberal Democrats as a radical, reforming force, putting forward policies for introducing home rule for Scotland and Wales, proportional representation, transforming the House of Lords into an elected Senate, and advancing environmental protections.{{sfn|Cook|2010|p=205}} At the September 1988 conference it adopted the short form name "the Democrats" and in October 1989 changed its name to "Liberal Democrats".{{sfnm|1a1=Taylor|1y=2007|1p=26|2a1=Cook|2y=2010|2p=202}}<ref name=30years>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/liberal-democrats-30-years-spd-lib-dem-liberal-coalition-nick-clegg-tim-farron-seats-commons-a8235791.html|title=Liberal Democrats at 30: How the third party went from Roy Jenkins to coalition government to the brink of extinction|author=Tom Peck|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|date=3 March 2018|accessdate=30 June 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190630190438/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/liberal-democrats-30-years-spd-lib-dem-liberal-coalition-nick-clegg-tim-farron-seats-commons-a8235791.html|archive-date=30 June 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> The bird of liberty was adopted as its logo.{{sfnm|1a1=Taylor|1y=2007|1pp=26–27|2a1=Cook|2y=2010|2p=205}} In 1989, its election results were poor: it lost 190 seats in the [[1989 United Kingdom local elections|May 1989 local elections]] and secured only 6.4% of the vote in the [[1989 European Parliament election in the United Kingdom|1989 European Parliament elections]], beaten to third position by the [[Green Party of England and Wales]].{{sfn|Cook|2010|pp=202–203}} This was the worst election result for an established third party since the 1950s.{{sfn|Cook|2010|p=204}} Its prospects were buoyed after it won the [[1990 Eastbourne by-election]], followed by-election victories in [[1991 Ribble Valley by-election|Ribble Valley]] and [[1991 Kincardine and Deeside by-election|Kincardine and Deeside]].{{sfnm|1a1=Taylor|1y=2007|1p=29|2a1=Cook|2y=2010|2pp=205–206}} In the [[1991 United Kingdom local elections|1991 local elections]] it secured a net gain of 520 seats.{{sfn|Cook|2010|p=207}} In the [[1992 United Kingdom general election|1992 general election]], it secured 17.8% of the vote and 20 seats in the House of Commons: 9 of these were in Scotland and 5 in Southwest England.{{sfn|Cook|2010|pp=209–212}}

=== Consolidation and growth (1992–1999) ===
[[File:PaddyAshdownCampaigning.jpg|thumb|[[Paddy Ashdown]], leader from 1988 to 1999]]
Between 1992 and 1997 the party underwent a period of consolidation, particularly on local councils.{{sfn|Cook|2010|p=213}} In the [[1994 United Kingdom local elections|1994 local elections]], it came second, pushing the Conservatives into third place.{{sfn|Cook|2010|p=219}} In the [[1994 European Parliament election in the United Kingdom|1994 European Parliament elections]], it gained two [[Members of the European Parliament]] (MEPs).{{sfn|Cook|2010|p=213}} In 1993, the party was damaged by allegations of racism on the Liberal Democrat-controlled council in Tower Hamlets;{{sfn|Cook|2010|p=219}} it faced additional problems as its distinctive centrist niche was threatened by the rise of [[Tony Blair]] and [[New Labour]], a project which pushed Labour to the centre.{{sfnm|1a1=Roberts|1y=1997|1p=463|2a1=Meadowcroft|2y=2000|2p=436|3a1=Cook|3y=2010|3p=213}} At the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997 general election]], it fielded 639 candidates,{{sfn|Cook|2010|p=232}} securing 46 MPs, the greatest number that the Liberals had had since 1929.{{sfn|Cook|2010|p=233}} These were concentrated in Southwest England, Southwest London, and areas of Scotland.{{sfn|Cook|2010|p=233}}

Although Blair's Labour won a landslide victory in 1997 and did not require a coalition government, Blair was interested in cooperation with the Lib Dems. In July 1997 he invited Ashdown and other senior Lib Dems to join a Cabinet Committee on constitutional affairs.{{sfn|Cook|2010|p=239}}<ref name="ashdownpact">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/522526.stm|title =Blair considered coalition after 1997|publisher =BBC|accessdate =23 March 2008|date =16 November 1999|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021223210743/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/522526.stm|archive-date =23 December 2002|url-status =live}}</ref> Privately, Blair offered the Liberal Democrats a coalition but later backed down amid fears that it would split his own Cabinet.{{sfn|Cook|2010|p=240}} The joint Committee launched the [[Jenkins Commission (UK)|Independent Commission on the Voting System]] in December;{{sfn|Cook|2010|p=241}} its report, published in October 1998, proposed the change from the [[first past the post]] electoral system to an [[Instant-runoff voting|alternative vote top-up system]]. This was not the Lib Dems preferred option—they wanted full [[proportional representation]]—although Ashdown hailed it as "a historic step forward".{{sfn|Cook|2010|p=243}} Many Lib Dems were concerned by Ashdown's growing closeness with Labour;{{sfn|Cook|2010|pp=239–240}} aware of this, he stepped down as party leader in 1999.{{sfn|Cook|2010|p=244}} Before he did so, the party took part in the 1999 elections for the Scottish Parliament and the Welsh Assembly. In both, the Lib Dems came fourth and became Labour's junior coalition partners.{{sfn|Cook|2010|pp=245–247}}

=== Charles Kennedy and Menzies Campbell (1999–2007) ===
The MP [[Simon Hughes]] was initially seen as Ashdown's most likely successor, but was defeated [[1999 Liberal Democrats leadership election|in the contest]] by [[Charles Kennedy]].{{sfn|Cook|2010|pp=249–250}} To reduce the impact of more leftist members who tended to dominate at conferences, Kennedy proposed that all members—rather than just conference delegates—should vote for the party's federal executive and federal policy committees.{{sfn|Cook|2010|p=252}} In 2001, Kennedy suspended the Joint Cabinet Committee with Labour.{{sfn|Cook|2010|p=261}} The media characterised him as "Inaction Man" and accused him of lacking a clear identity and political purpose;{{sfn|Cook|2010|pp=251, 255}} later criticism also focused on his alcoholism.{{sfn|Cook|2010|p=267}}<ref name="worstkeptsecret">{{cite web|year=2006|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/nickrobinson/2006/01/westminsters_wo.html|title=Westminster's worst kept secret?|publisher=BBC|accessdate=23 March 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316235629/http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/nickrobinson/2006/01/westminsters_wo.html |archive-date=16 March 2012 |url-status=dead}}</ref> In the [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001 general election]], the party fielded 639 candidates and made a net gain of 6, bringing its total of seats to 52.{{sfn|Cook|2010|p=257}}<ref name="2001generalelection">{{cite news|year=2001|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/vote2001/results_constituencies/default.stm|title=Results & Constituencies|publisher=BBC|accessdate=29 March 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080407095626/http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/vote2001/results_constituencies/default.stm|archive-date=7 April 2008|url-status=live}}</ref>

[[File:Charles Peter Kennedy.jpg|thumb|left|upright|225px|[[Charles Kennedy]], leader from 1999 to 2006]]
Following the [[11 September 2001]] attacks in the United States and the launch of the U.S.-led [[War on terror|War on Terror]], the Liberal Democrat MPs backed the government's decision to participate in the [[United States invasion of Afghanistan]].{{sfn|Cook|2010|pp=261–262}} The party was more critical of Blair's decision to participate in the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|U.S.-led invasion of Iraq]] in 2003; Kennedy joined the [[15 February 2003 anti-war protests#London|large anti-war march]] in London.{{sfn|Cook|2010|p=264}} With the Conservatives backing the Labour government's decision to go to war, the Lib Dems were the only major party opposing it.{{sfn|Cook|2010|p=264}} In following years, Lib Dem MPs increasingly voted against the Labour government on a range of issues.{{sfn|Cook|2010|p=274}} Much of this Lib Dem opposition to the government came from their members in the House of Lords.{{sfn|Cook|2010|p=274}} In the [[2003 United Kingdom local elections|2003 local elections]], the party secured about 30% of the vote, its highest ever result.{{sfn|Cook|2010|p=265}}

In 2004, ''[[The Orange Book: Reclaiming Liberalism|The Orange Book]]'' anthology was published. Written largely by centre-right economists in the party, it sparked discussions about Liberal Democrat philosophy and brought criticism from the party's social-liberal wing.{{sfn|Cook|2010|p=272}} In the [[2005 United Kingdom general election|2005 general election]], the Lib Dems secured 62 seats, the most the Liberals had had since 1923.{{sfn|Cook|2010|p=275}}<ref name="better2005election">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2005/apr/26/liberaldemocrats.election2005|title=Kennedy can still exploit this perfect political storm|work=The Guardian|accessdate=21 March 2008|location=London|first=Martin|last=Kettle|date=26 April 2005|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130829040759/http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2005/apr/26/liberaldemocrats.election2005|archive-date=29 August 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> Kennedy however faced growing calls to resign over his alcoholism; in January 2006 he did so.{{sfn|Cook|2010|pp=281–282}} In March, [[Menzies Campbell]] succeeded him as party leader.{{sfn|Cook|2010|pp=284–286}} Campbell was not popular with voters and faced a resurgent Conservative Party under [[David Cameron]];{{sfn|Cook|2010|p=287}} in the [[2007 United Kingdom local elections|May 2007 local elections]] the party experienced a net loss of nearly 250 seats.{{sfn|Cook|2010|pp=288–289}} In [[2007 Scottish Parliament election|that year's Scottish Parliament]] election, the [[Scottish National Party]] (SNP) secured the largest vote and the Lib Dem/Labour coalition ended.{{sfn|Cook|2010|p=289}} Campbell was frustrated at the constant media focus on the fact that he was in his late sixties; in October he resigned and [[Vince Cable]] became acting leader.{{sfn|Cook|2010|p=290}}<ref name="campbellquits">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/7045833.stm|title=Campbell quits as Lib Dem leader|publisher=BBC|accessdate=28 January 2008|date=15 October 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071016190036/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/7045833.stm|archive-date=16 October 2007|url-status=live}}</ref>

== Policy platform ==
=== Constitutional reform ===
[[File:Liberal Democrat Conference 2011.jpg|thumb|300px|upright|The 2011 Liberal Democrats conference]]
The Liberal Democrats support institutional reform in the United Kingdom, including the decentralisation of state power, reform of Parliament, and electoral reform.{{sfn|Whiteley|Seyd|Billinghurst|2006|p=26}} At its 1993 conference, the party put forward plans for the introduction of [[Fixed-term election|fixed term parliaments]],{{sfn|Cook|2010|p=218}} something it would later secure in the coalition government of 2010–2015.{{sfn|Cook|2010|p=321}} Also in 1993, it proposed state funding for political parties.{{sfn|Cook|2010|p=218}} The Liberal Democrats have long included a commitment to proportional representation in their manifestos.{{sfn|Cook|2010|p=256}} According to the ''[[New Statesman]]'', this is the "one policy with which the Liberal Democrats are identified in the minds of the public."<ref>{{cite news|last1=Bogdanor|first1=Verdon|title=Why the Lib Dems want electoral reform|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/uk-politics/2010/09/alternative-vote-liberal|accessdate=14 May 2015|work=[[New Statesman]]|date=21 September 2010|url-access=limited|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150722230631/http://www.newstatesman.com/uk-politics/2010/09/alternative-vote-liberal|archive-date=22 July 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> The Lib Dems calls for devolution or [[home rule]] for Scotland and Wales were enacted by Blair's Labour government in the late 1990s.{{sfn|Cook|2010|p=239}} The 1993 conference also called for the introduction of a [[bill of rights]] into the British constitution.{{sfn|Cook|2010|p=218}} Its 2001 manifesto included a commitment to lowering the voting age from 18 to 16.{{sfn|Cook|2010|p=256}}

According to a 1999 survey, two-thirds of party members supported retaining the monarchy.{{sfn|Whiteley|Seyd|Billinghurst|2006|pp=26–27}} In the 1990s, there was an anti-royalist contingent within the party;{{sfn|Cook|2010|p=225}} in 1993, the party conference announced support for removing the [[Royal prerogative in the United Kingdom|royal prerogative]],{{sfn|Cook|2010|p=218}} and the 2000 conference backed calls for the monarch to be removed as the [[Supreme Governor of the Church of England|Supreme Governor]] of the [[Church of England]].{{sfn|Cook|2010|p=255}} At its 2003 conference, the party's Youth and Student League put forward a motion calling for the abolition of the monarchy and the introduction of an elected [[head of state]].{{sfn|Cook|2010|p=267}} The 2000 party conference produced a call for the [[Act of Settlement 1701|1701 Act of Settlement]] to be reformed so as to allow the heir to the throne to marry a Roman Catholic,{{sfn|Cook|2010|p=255}} while the party's 2001 manifesto called for the disestablishment of the Church of England.{{sfn|Cook|2010|p=256}}

=== Economic and social welfare policy ===
[[File:LibDem posterboards Hornsey Wood Green 7 May 2015.jpg|thumb|Liberal Democrats campaigning stakeboards in [[Hornsey and Wood Green]] in 2015]]
The 1999 membership survey found that most favoured free markets and individual responsibility; they were nevertheless split on whether or not they regarded private enterprise as the best way to solve economic problems.{{sfn|Whiteley|Seyd|Billinghurst|2006|p=28}} Most were against either further privatisation or further nationalisation, although they were overwhelmingly favourable to increasing taxation and government spending.{{sfn|Whiteley|Seyd|Billinghurst|2006|p=29}} The membership was also heavily against additional restrictions on trade unions.{{sfn|Whiteley|Seyd|Billinghurst|2006|p=29}}

Liberal Democrat policy has generally been favourable to social welfare spending.{{sfn|Whiteley|Seyd|Billinghurst|2006|p=86}} During the 2000s, the party made pledges for major investment into health, education, and public services.{{sfn|Cook|2010|p=256}} In 1995, the party announced a plan to put £2&nbsp;billion into education, including nursery places for under fives,{{sfn|Cook|2010|p=228}} while its 2005 manifesto included a commitment to use £1.5&nbsp;billion to decrease class sizes in schools.{{sfn|Cook|2010|p=275}} In the 2000s, the party also pledged to abolish tuition fees for university students,{{sfn|Cook|2010|p=268}} and in the build-up to the 2010 general election, Clegg pledged that under a Lib Dem government this would be achieved over six years.{{sfn|Cook|2010|p=307}} In 2004, it pledged to add £25 a week to the [[state pension]] for people over the age of 75.{{sfn|Cook|2010|p=273}} In 2003, it outlined plans for devolving control of schools to local councils.{{sfn|Cook|2010|p=268}}

In the mid-1990s and early 2000s, it stated that such increases in education spending would be funded through higher taxes. These included a 50% tax on those earning over £100,000 a year,{{sfn|Cook|2010|pp=228, 256}} and raising the [[Income tax in the United Kingdom|basic rate]] of income tax by one penny in the pound.{{sfn|Cook|2010|pp=233, 256}} In 2003, the party's conference approved plans for a local income tax of 3.5 pence in the pound that would replace [[Council Tax|council tax]]; the party believed that this would result in 70% of the population paying less tax.{{sfn|Cook|2010|p=267}} In 2006, the party abandoned its plans for a 50% tax on the highest earners,{{sfn|Cook|2010|p=288}} and also put forward plans to cut income tax but balance the books by increasing tax on air travel and introducing a carbon tax.{{sfn|Cook|2010|p=288}}

Under Clegg, the party emphasised lowering taxes rather than raising them; it stated that a 4 pence reduction in the basic rate tax could be permitted by finding £20&nbsp;billion savings in Whitehall. This measure was opposed by the left of the party.{{sfn|Cook|2010|p=298}} Amid the 2008 recession, Clegg called for £20&nbsp;billion cuts to state spending, to be funded by measures like reducing the number of people eligible for [[tax credit]]s and scrapping road building schemes.{{sfn|Cook|2010|p=299}} In its 2010 manifesto, it pledged to end income taxes for those earning under £10,000 a year,{{sfn|Cook|2010|p=309}} something it introduced through the Cameron coalition government.{{sfn|Cook|2010|p=321}} Also in 2010, it stated that it would halve the national deficit over the course of four years.{{sfn|Cook|2010|p=307}} It had also specified that it would oppose any increases in VAT, although when in coalition announced an increase in VAT to 20%.{{sfn|Cook|2010|p=324}}

=== Foreign policy and the European Union ===
The Liberal Democrats supported the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|war in Afghanistan]] in 2001.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kriner|first=Douglas|date=2010|title=Elites, Events and British Support for the War in Afghanistan|url=https://ssrn.com/abstract=1644301|journal=APSA 2010 Annual Meeting Paper}}</ref> The party was the only of Britain's three major parties to oppose the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]].{{sfn|Whiteley|Seyd|Billinghurst|2006|pp=146–147}} The party's leadership stressed that this was not because the party was intrinsically anti-war, but because the invasion did not have support from the [[United Nations]].{{sfn|Grayson|2007|p=6}} In the wake of the invasion, the party's 2005 manifesto included a pledge that the UK would never again support a military occupation deemed illegal under international law.{{sfn|Cook|2010|p=275}} [[Menzies Campbell]] demanded the suspension of all future arms exports to [[Israel]] during the [[2006 Lebanon War]] and [[Operation Summer Rains]].<ref>{{cite news|title=British arms exports to Israel double in a year |date=25 July 2006|work=The Guardian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/israel/Story/0,,1828246,00.html | location=London | first=Richard | last=Norton-Taylor}}</ref>

Whiteley et al. noted that "like the Liberals before them, [the Liberal Democrats] have taken a strong positive position on internationalism", including the need for international cooperation, aid for the developing world, and European integration.{{sfn|Whiteley|Seyd|Billinghurst|2006|p=12}} In this they have always been more internationalist and pro-Europeanist than either Labour or the Conservatives.{{sfn|Whiteley|Seyd|Billinghurst|2006|p=12}}

[[File:Liberal Democrats "Bollocks to Brexit" campaigning 2019.jpg|thumb|Following the 2016 referendum which produced a majority in favour of Brexit, the Lib Dems campaigned against the decision with its somewhat controversial "Bollocks to Brexit" campaign]]
From its foundation, the Liberal Democrats were committed to the UK's membership of the [[European Union]].{{sfn|Cook|2010|p=205}} In 1993, it called for the UK to take a lead in seeking a timetable for the adoption of a pan-European currency, and also called for the formation of an autonomous European central bank.{{sfn|Cook|2010|p=218}} A 1999 survey of party members found they overwhelmingly backed European integration, and two thirds wanted the UK to adopt the [[euro]] currency.{{sfn|Whiteley|Seyd|Billinghurst|2006|p=27}} In its 1999 manifesto for the European Parliamentary elections, it called for completing the European single market, holding a referendum on the adoption of the euro currency, establishing an EU constitution, expanding the EU into Central and Eastern Europe, and encouraging an EU-wide clampdown on pollution and international crime.{{sfn|Cook|2010|p=247}} This attitude had been inherited from the Liberal Party which had originally proposing membership into the predecessor [[European Coal and Steel Community]].<ref name="Jones2007">{{cite book|author=Alistair Jones|title=Britain and the European Union|url=https://archive.org/details/britaineuropeanu0000jone|url-access=registration|year=2007|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|isbn=978-0-7486-2428-7|page=[https://archive.org/details/britaineuropeanu0000jone/page/137 137]|access-date=27 June 2016}}</ref> However, the Liberal Democrats oppose the [[Federalisation of the European Union|European federalism]] espoused by their counterparts.<ref name="Geddes2013">{{cite book|author=Andrew Geddes|title=Britain and the European Union|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NDsdBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA243|date=15 January 2013|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=978-1-137-29743-3|page=243|access-date=27 June 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170201080538/https://books.google.com/books?id=NDsdBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA243|archive-date=1 February 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

Despite its pro-European stance, the party has included [[Euroscepticism|Eurosceptics]] such as the MP [[Nick Harvey]].{{sfn|Cook|2010|p=249}} The 1999 membership survey found that 37% wanted the UK to remain in the EU but to have the latter's powers reduced while 5% of members wanted the UK to leave the EU altogether.{{sfn|Whiteley|Seyd|Billinghurst|2006|p=28}} Cook argued that whereas the Lib Dems were once "the most pro-European of all British parties", by 2008 it had "a vocal Eurosceptic element" who were opposed to the British ratification of the EU's [[Treaty of Lisbon|Lisbon Treaty]] without a referendum.{{sfn|Cook|2010|p=294}} Under Clegg, the party backed away from its hardline pro-EU position.{{sfn|Cook|2010|p=298}}

In June 2016, following the [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|United Kingdom European Union membership referendum]] in which 51.9% voted in favour of leaving the European Union, Tim Farron said that if Liberal Democrats were to be elected in the next parliamentary election, they would not follow through with triggering [[s:Consolidated version of the Treaty on European Union/Title VI: Final Provisions#Article 50|Article 50]] of the [[Treaty on European Union]] and [[Withdrawal from the European Union|leaving the EU]] ("Any Member State may decide to withdraw from the Union in accordance with its own constitutional requirements") but would instead keep UK part of the EU.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Stone|first1=Jon|title=Liberal Democrats pledge to ignore referendum result and keep Britain in the EU|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-eu-referendum-result-lib-dems-remain-liberal-democrats-live-policy-stay-leave-a7103186.html|accessdate=27 June 2016|work=The Independent|date=25 June 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160626233607/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-eu-referendum-result-lib-dems-remain-liberal-democrats-live-policy-stay-leave-a7103186.html|archive-date=26 June 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> Following this promise, the Liberal Democrats claim that their membership has increased by 10,000 since the referendum; at one point, the growth in the party was the equivalent of one person joining per minute.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Mortimer|first1=Caroline|title=Liberal Democrat membership surging with 'one person a minute joining' following party's pledge to fight Brexit|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/liberal-democrat-membership-brexit-latest-remain-tim-farron-london-stays-a7109906.html|accessdate=1 July 2016|work=The Independent|date=29 June 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160701132536/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/liberal-democrat-membership-brexit-latest-remain-tim-farron-london-stays-a7109906.html|archive-date=1 July 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> Campaigning for a second referendum regarding the exact goals of Brexit negotiation was one of the party's flagship policies in the [[2017 United Kingdom general election|2017 general election]] and the [[2019 United Kingdom general election|2019 general election]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.libdems.org.uk/europe |title=The Liberal Democrat Plan for Britain in Europe |publisher=Libdems.org.uk |date=6 September 2016 |accessdate=12 November 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180308045300/https://www.libdems.org.uk/europe |archive-date=8 March 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>

=== Environmentalism ===
The Liberal Democrats have strongly advocated for environmental protection and have typically taken more radical stances on environmental issues than either Labour or the Conservatives.{{sfn|Whiteley|Seyd|Billinghurst|2006|p=13}} In 1993, the party put forward proposals for an EU tax on energy use and CO2 emissions.{{sfn|Cook|2010|p=218}} That year, it also proposed that GDP should be redefined to take into account pollution and the depletion of natural resources.{{sfn|Cook|2010|p=219}} At its 2009 conference, the party introduced a commitment for Lib Dem controlled councils to cut their carbon emissions by 10% in 2010.{{sfn|Cook|2010|p=306}} Other policies included:

=== Human rights and individual liberty ===
[[File:Lib Dem Trafalgar Square Flashmob (4582025906).jpg|thumb|Members of a Lib Dems [[flash mob]] in London's [[Trafalgar Square]] in the build-up to the [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010 general election]]]]
The Liberal Democrats place greater emphasis on human rights and individual freedoms than the Conservatives or Labour.{{sfn|Whiteley|Seyd|Billinghurst|2006|p=14}} Conversely, the political scientist John Meadowcroft expressed the view that "the Liberal Democrats are a supposedly liberal party that does not believe in liberty."{{sfn|Meadowcroft|2008|p=93}} Commenting on the 1999 membership survey, Whiteley et al. noted that the majority of members took "a distinctly right of centre view" on many, although not all, moral and legal issues.{{sfn|Whiteley|Seyd|Billinghurst|2006|p=32}}

Its 1997 manifesto committed the party to lowering the [[age of consent]] for same-sex couples to 16, bringing it in line with that for mixed-sex couples.{{sfn|Cook|2010|p=233}} At its 2000 conference, party delegates backed calls for the government to provide legal recognition for same-sex relationships.{{sfn|Cook|2010|p=255}} In the 1999 membership survey, 57% believed that the government should discourage the growth of one-parent families.{{sfn|Whiteley|Seyd|Billinghurst|2006|p=32}} That same survey found just over half of the party membership expressing pro-choice views regarding abortion access.{{sfn|Whiteley|Seyd|Billinghurst|2006|p=31}}

At its 1997 conference, the party's delegates voted in favour of establishing a Royal Commission to examine the possibility of decriminalising [[voluntary euthanasia]].{{sfn|Cook|2010|p=240}}

At its 1994 conference, party delegates voted to end criminal prosecutions for cannabis possession, although the party's 23 MPs voted against the measure.{{sfn|Cook|2010|p=225}} The 1999 membership survey suggested a tougher stance on many law and order issues, with over half wanting longer sentencing and no option of parole for those serving life sentences.{{sfn|Whiteley|Seyd|Billinghurst|2006|p=32}} The 2004 party congress approved a ban on smoking in public places.{{sfn|Cook|2010|p=269}}

In March 2016, the Liberal Democrats became the first major political party in the UK to support the legalisation of cannabis. The party supports cannabis sale and possession to be legal for all UK adults aged 18-years-old and over, the set up of specialist licensed stores to sell cannabis, the legalisation of home cultivation of cannabis for personal use, small scale cannabis clubs to be licensed, and a new regulator to oversee the market.<ref>{{cite news |date= 8 March 2016 |title= Liberal Democrats become first major party to back cannabis legalisation |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35749080 |work= BBC News |accessdate= 28 August 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190828175757/https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35749080 |archive-date= 28 August 2019 |url-status= live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last= Leftly |first= Mark |date= 12 March 2016 |title= Liberal Democrats become first major party to back cannabis legalisation |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/cannabis-marijuana-legalisation-liberal-democrats-drug-policy-a6927936.html |work= The Independent |accessdate= 28 August 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190828154939/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/cannabis-marijuana-legalisation-liberal-democrats-drug-policy-a6927936.html |archive-date= 28 August 2019 |url-status= live }}</ref>

== Organisation and structure ==
{{see also|Federal Board (Liberal Democrats)|English Liberal Democrats|Scottish Liberal Democrats|Welsh Liberal Democrats}}
The Liberal Democrats are a [[Federation|federal]] party of the parties of England, Scotland, and Wales. The English and Scottish parties are further split into regions. The parliamentary parties of the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]], the [[House of Lords]], the [[Scottish Parliament]] and [[Welsh Assembly]] form semi-autonomous units within the party. The leaders in the House of Commons and the Scottish Parliament are the leaders of the federal party and the Scottish Party; the leaders in the other two chambers, and the officers of all parliamentary parties, are elected from their own number. Co-ordination of all party activities across all federated groups is undertaken through the Federal Board. Chaired by the party leader, its 30+ members includes representatives from each of the groups and democratically elected representatives.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.libdems.org.uk/party_organisations_detail.aspx?title=Federal_Executive&pPK=8dae9f78-9643-4cbd-a41e-1d3e37521826|title=Federal Executive|publisher=Liberal Democrats|accessdate=10 May 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100523102231/http://www.libdems.org.uk/party_organisations_detail.aspx?title=Federal_Executive&pPK=8dae9f78-9643-4cbd-a41e-1d3e37521826|archive-date=23 May 2010}}</ref>

== Support ==
In the 2005 general election, the party was endorsed by ''[[The Independent]]''.{{sfn|Cook|2010|p=275}} Cook noted that in the build-up to the 2010 election, most mainstream press—which was aligned with either the Conservatives or Labour—was "voraciously hostile" to the Lib Dems.{{sfn|Cook|2010|p=316}} In that election, it nevertheless attracted the endorsement of ''[[The Guardian]]'' and ''[[The Observer]]''.{{sfn|Cook|2010|p=310}}

=== Finances ===
Whereas Labour gained funding through its links to trade unions and the Conservatives through big business, the Liberal Democrats have relied on funds raised by the subscriptions and donations provided by its members.{{sfn|Whiteley|Seyd|Billinghurst|2006|p=173}} The party had some major donors, such as Lord Jacobs, who gave it around £1&nbsp;million over the course of twenty years until he resigned in 2008.{{sfn|Cook|2010|p=298}} In some years, it struggled to cover its costs; in 2008 for instance it made a loss of £670,000.{{sfn|Cook|2010|p=304}}

[[File:Birmingham's Bin-Brexit rally for the Conservative Party conference, September 30, 2018 25.jpg|thumb|250px|The Liberal Democrat contingent at an anti-Brexit rally in Birmingham in September 2018]]
In its early years, the caricature of Liberal Democrat members was that of "sandal-wearing, bearded eccentrics obsessed by the minutiae of electoral reform".{{sfn|Cook|2010|p=261}} Based on their 1999 survey of Liberal Democrat members, Whiteley noted that although party members shared many of the same attitudes as the party's voters, there were also "striking differences", namely in that members were "older, more middle-class and better educated" than the voters.{{sfn|Whiteley|Seyd|Billinghurst|2006|p=17}} Their survey found that party membership was 54% male;{{sfn|Whiteley|Seyd|Billinghurst|2006|pp=22–23}} and was dominated by middle-class people, with working-class individuals comprising only 5% of members (in contrast to 30% of Labour and 19% of Conservative members at that time).{{sfn|Whiteley|Seyd|Billinghurst|2006|pp=24–25}} The average age was 59, and 58% of members were aged 56 or over.{{sfn|Whiteley|Seyd|Billinghurst|2006|p=23}} A third were retired, and a third in full-time employment.{{sfn|Whiteley|Seyd|Billinghurst|2006|p=24}} A majority worked, or had previously worked, in the non-profit sector.{{sfn|Whiteley|Seyd|Billinghurst|2006|p=24}} 42% possessed a degree, which was higher than among Labour (30%) and Conservative (19%) members at that time.{{sfn|Whiteley|Seyd|Billinghurst|2006|p=23}} 65% of members considered themselves religious, with 70% of those being [[Anglicanism|Anglican]], 15% [[Methodism|Methodist]], and 11% [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholic]].{{sfn|Whiteley|Seyd|Billinghurst|2006|p=25}}

As of 1999, 43% of members had previously belonged to the Liberal Party, 14% to the Social Democratic Party, and 42% had joined with no previous political affiliation.{{sfn|Whiteley|Seyd|Billinghurst|2006|p=55}} 21% of members had joined because of their social contacts, such as friends, family, and colleagues, who were already members.{{sfn|Whiteley|Seyd|Billinghurst|2006|pp=68–69}} Around 40% of members stated that they joined because they agreed with the party's principles; a further 16% said they joined because of its policies.{{sfn|Whiteley|Seyd|Billinghurst|2006|p=69}} The majority of members were largely inactive in party activities, with only 22% of those polled indicating that they were willing to attend party meetings.{{sfn|Whiteley|Seyd|Billinghurst|2006|pp=71–72}}

The senior ranks of the party have long been heavily male-dominated; after the 1997 general election, for instance, only three of its 46 MPs were women.{{sfn|Whiteley|Seyd|Billinghurst|2006|p=22}} Reinforcing its "male, middle-class image", after the 2010 election, 40% of Liberal Democrat MPs were privately educated.{{sfn|Cook|2010|p=312}}

=== Voters ===
The 1997 British Election Study Survey found that the average Liberal Democrat voter was aged 47, with 52% between the ages of 18 and 45.{{sfn|Whiteley|Seyd|Billinghurst|2006|pp=36–37}} 16% of Lib Dem voters at that time possessed a degree.{{sfn|Whiteley|Seyd|Billinghurst|2006|pp=36–37}} 23% were working class or blue collar workers, a much higher percentage than was found among the party's membership.{{sfn|Whiteley|Seyd|Billinghurst|2006|pp=36–37}} The survey found that Liberal Democrat voters shared many attitudes with the members; these voters overwhelmingly desired proportional representation and 63% backed EU membership.{{sfn|Whiteley|Seyd|Billinghurst|2006|pp=37–38}} Where the voters differed from the members was on the issue of foreign aid; over half of members wanted to increase the UK's foreign aid budget, whereas only a third of Liberal Democrat voters agreed.{{sfn|Whiteley|Seyd|Billinghurst|2006|pp=41–42}}

Analysing voting patterns from the 1990s, Whiteley et al. argued that highly educated people were more likely than average to vote Liberal Democrat, that older people were less likely than average to vote Liberal Democrat, and that class, gender, or ethnicity had no impact on the tendency to vote for the party.{{sfn|Whiteley|Seyd|Billinghurst|2006|p=163}}

From the Liberal Party, the Liberal Democrats inherited a strong base in Wales and Scotland.{{sfn|Whiteley|Seyd|Billinghurst|2006|p=6}} In 2010, Cook noted that the party's safe seats "do not fit a very homogenous pattern", being scattered amidst rural, middle-class suburban, and inner city areas.{{sfn|Cook|2010|pp=313–314}} A key feature of the party's electoral strategy has been foregrounding community politics.{{sfn|Whiteley|Seyd|Billinghurst|2006|p=89}} Examining the survey evidence, Whiteley et al. argued that the strength of grassroots party activism in a particular area had a big impact on the vote share that the Liberal Democrats received there.{{sfn|Whiteley|Seyd|Billinghurst|2006|p=135}}

=== General elections ===
[[File:LibDem vote-seat %.PNG|thumb|350px|Liberal Democrats vote and seat share, 1983–2017]]
Throughout its history, the first past the post system has prevented the Liberal Democrats from receiving a share of parliamentary seats that reflects their share of the vote.{{sfn|Whiteley|Seyd|Billinghurst|2006|p=139}}

In the 1992 general election, the Lib Dems succeeded the SDP–Liberal Alliance as the third most popular party, behind Labour and the Conservatives.

The first elections to the newly created National Assembly for Wales were in 1999; the Liberal Democrats took six seats in the inaugural Assembly; [[Welsh Labour]] won a [[plurality (voting)|plurality]] of seats, but without an overall majority. In October 2000, following a series of close votes, the parties formed a [[Lib-Lab Pact|coalition]], with the Liberal Democrat leader in the assembly, [[Mike German, Baron German|Michael German]], becoming the [[Deputy First Minister for Wales|Deputy First Minister]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2000/oct/16/wales.devolution | title=Lib Dems agree Welsh Assembly power deal | newspaper=The Guardian | accessdate=9 June 2009 | location=London | first=Geoffrey | last=Gibbs | date=16 October 2000 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140509054010/http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2000/oct/16/wales.devolution | archive-date=9 May 2014 | url-status=live }}</ref> The deal lasted until the 2003 election, when Labour won enough seats to be able to govern outright.<ref name="2003waleselection">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/3007665.stm|title=Morgan pledges to govern alone|publisher=BBC|accessdate=21 March 2008|date=7 May 2003|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060323185420/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/3007665.stm|archive-date=23 March 2006|url-status=live}}</ref>

The party had polled consistently in the first four elections to the National Assembly, returning six representatives in the first three elections and five in the [[2011 National Assembly for Wales election|2011 Election]], thereby establishing itself as the fourth party in Wales behind Labour, the Conservatives and [[Plaid Cymru]], but fell to just one seat in 2016. Between 2008 and 2016, the leader of the [[Welsh Liberal Democrats]] was [[Kirsty Williams]], the assembly member for [[Brecon and Radnorshire (Assembly constituency)|Brecon & Radnorshire]], the Assembly's first female party leader.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/7771745.stm|title=Williams election breaks mould|publisher=BBC|accessdate=9 June 2009|date=8 December 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081211093241/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/7771745.stm|archive-date=11 December 2008|url-status=live}}</ref>

== Reception ==
In 2006, Whiteley et al. noted that the Liberal Democrats were "a major force in contemporary British politics".{{sfn|Whiteley|Seyd|Billinghurst|2006|p=170}} Although throughout its history, the party had been relegated to third party status, they argued that it had the capability of breaking through to become one of the country's main two parties if proportional representation (or something like it) was introduced, or if either the Conservatives or Labour were severely weakened by splitting in two.{{sfn|Whiteley|Seyd|Billinghurst|2006|pp=174–175}}
