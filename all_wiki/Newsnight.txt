It broadcasts on weekdays at 10:45pm (formerly 10:30pm before the [[COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom|coronavirus pandemic]]) on [[BBC Two]], and is also available on [[BBC iPlayer]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0by7q5m|title=Newsnight provides "in-depth investigation and analysis of the stories behind the day's headlines"|website=BBC|access-date=22 March 2019|archive-date=26 March 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190326073457/https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0by7q5m|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episodes/b006mk25/newsnight|title=Newsnight available on BBC iPlayer|website=BBC|access-date=22 March 2019|archive-date=26 March 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190326073449/https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episodes/b006mk25/newsnight|url-status=live}}</ref>

==History==
[[Image:BBC Newsnight.jpg|thumb|left|170px|The original 1980 opening titles]]
''Newsnight'' began on 28 January 1980 at 10.45pm, although a 15-minute news bulletin using the same title had run on BBC Two for a 13-month period from 1975 to 1976. Its launch was delayed by four months by the [[Association of Broadcasting Staff]], at the time the main BBC trade union.<ref name="Billen">Andrew Billen [http://www.newstatesman.com/node/136822 "Flagship sails on"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150427134023/http://www.newstatesman.com/node/136822 |date=27 April 2015 }}, ''New Statesman'', 7 February 2000</ref> ''Newsnight'' was the first programme to be made by means of a direct collaboration between BBC News, then at [[BBC Television Centre|Television Centre]], and the current affairs department, based a short distance away at the now defunct [[Lime Grove Studios]]. Staff feared job cuts. The newscast also served as a replacement for the current affairs programme ''[[Tonight (1957 TV series)|Tonight]]''.

Former presenters include [[Peter Snow]], a regular for 17 years, [[Donald MacCormick]], [[Charles Wheeler (journalist)|Charles Wheeler]], [[Adam Raphael]] and [[John Tusa]], later boss of the [[BBC World Service]]. In the early days each edition had an 'auxiliary presenter', a phenomenon pejoratively known at the time as the "Newsnight's wife syndrome".<ref name="Billen"/> Usually a woman, it was her job to read the news headlines and to introduce minor items. [[Olivia O'Leary]] in 1985 became the first principal female presenter; the programme has had a single presenter since 1987.<ref name="BBCa">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8072060.stm "A history of Newsnight"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121124164631/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8072060.stm |date=24 November 2012 }}, BBC News, 28 May 2009</ref> ''Newsnight'' is now wholly managed by [[BBC News]].<ref name="BBCa"/>

Until 1988, the start time of ''Newsnight'' was flexible, so BBC Two could screen a movie at 9:30pm to dovetail with the conclusion of the main news on BBC One. The fixed time slot of 10:30pm was established in the face of fierce objections from the then managing director of BBC TV, [[Bill Cotton]], otherwise in charge of all scheduling decisions. The very announcement was made without him even being informed. The affair sparked a widely reported row within the corporation. One protagonist said it would "destroy the BBC".<ref>Chris Horrie and Steve Clarke 'Fuzzy Monsters: Fear and Loathing at the BBC' (1994)</ref>  ''Newsnight'' moved to new facilities at [[Broadcasting House]] on 15 October 2012.

Between 1999 and 2014 on [[BBC Two Scotland]] the offshoot, ''[[Newsnight Scotland]]'', presented by [[Gordon Brewer]], replaced the final twenty minutes of the UK programme from Monday to Friday. From May 2014, ''Newsnight'' is again shown in full in Scotland, but delayed by half an hour to accommodate ''Newsnight Scotland'''s replacement, ''[[Scotland 2014]]''. In more recent years Scottish viewers have seen the full edition of the show without a separate programme. The flagship news programmes for BBC Scotland are now shown on their separate channel.

During the [[COVID-19 pandemic]], Newsnight reverted to a 10:45pm start time from 30 March 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tvhome.co.uk/bbc-two/2020/03/30/2245|title=BBC Two - Authoritative 1|website=tvhome.co.uk}}</ref> This was due to Newsnight temporarily sharing a studio with [[BBC News at Ten]] during the pandemic to cut footfall in Broadcasting House and allow  turnover in the studio, with News at Ten not finishing until 10:35. Further, during the pandemic, some editions presented by Kirsty Wark have been presented from [[BBC Scotland]]'s Pacific Quay headquarters in Glasgow. However, Wark still travelled to London during weeks she presented more episodes of the show (e.g. when main presenter Emily Maitlis was on holiday). It is expected that Newsnight will return to the normal scheduling when social distancing rules have been eased.

In October 2020 the show moved to a new studio, but continued to broadcast from 10.45 instead of reverting to its pre-pandemic time slot.

''Newsnight'''s [[theme music|signature tune]] was composed by [[George Fenton]]. Various arrangements have been used over the years.

==Notable interviews==
===Jeremy Paxman interviews Michael Howard MP===
[[File:Jeremy Paxman, Presenter, Newsnight; Author, Great Britain’s Great War (12638396983).jpg|thumb|170px|left|[[Jeremy Paxman]]]]
In May 1997, [[Jeremy Paxman]] pressed former [[Home Secretary]] [[Michael Howard]]  about a meeting with head of the [[Her Majesty's Prison Service|Prison Service]] Derek Lewis about the possible dismissal of the governor of [[Parkhurst (HM Prison)|Parkhurst Prison]]. Faced with what he considered evasive answers, Paxman put the same question– "Did you threaten to overrule him?" (i.e. Lewis)– twelve times in succession.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/newsnight/newsnight25/4182569.stm|title=Paxman versus Howard|website=BBC News|access-date=15 February 2006|archive-date=4 February 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090204222306/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/newsnight/newsnight25/4182569.stm|url-status=live}}</ref>

This has become the programme's best known interview. Later, during a twentieth anniversary edition of ''Newsnight'', Paxman told Howard that he'd simply been trying desperately to string out the interview because the next item in the running order had failed to materialise.<ref>Paxman's explanation was that "by the time I'd asked the question five or six times... it was clear... that you [Howard] weren't going to answer it... at which point a voice came in my ear and said "The next piece of tape isn't cut, you'd better carry on with this for a while" and I'm afraid I couldn't think of anything else to ask you."</ref> In 2004, Paxman raised the subject again with Howard, by then leader of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] to get a final answer.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/av/uk-politics-27916609/jeremy-paxman-takes-on-michael-howard-one-last-time|title=Jeremy Paxman takes on Michael Howard one last time|website=BBC News|access-date=2017-07-27}}</ref>{{Failed verification|date=April 2019}} This time, Howard laughed it off, saying that he had not threatened to overrule the head of the Prison Service.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} During Paxman's final show in June 2014, Howard briefly appeared in the studio once more, with Paxman simply asking "Did you?", to which Howard replied "No Jeremy, I didn't, but feel free to ask another 11 times."<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-27903226 ''Jeremy Paxman hosts his final Newsnight''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140619013149/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-27903226 |date=19 June 2014 }}, BBC News, 18 June 2014</ref>

===Emily Maitlis interviews Prince Andrew, Duke of York===
In November 2019, [[Emily Maitlis]] interviewed [[Prince Andrew, Duke of York]] about his relationship with [[conviction|convicted]] [[sex offender]] [[Jeffrey Epstein]], who was found dead in August whilst awaiting [[criminal procedure|trial]]. The interview was months in the making and Maitlis got the sign-off only 48 hours before.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Maitlis |first1=Emily |title=Emily Maitlis: ‘Prince Andrew was unleashed.

In the interview, the Duke of York denied having [[sexual intercourse|sex]] with [[Virginia Roberts Giuffre]] in March 2001, as she had accused, because he had been at home with his daughters, having taken his elder daughter [[Princess Beatrice of York|Beatrice]], to a party at [[PizzaExpress|Pizza Express]] in [[Woking]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Prince Andrew denies sex with 17-year-old because he was ‘at Pizza Express’ on night in question|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/prince-andrew-interview-pizza-express-virginia-roberts-guiffre-jeffrey-epstein-newsnight-a9205916.html|work=[[The Independent]]|date=16 November 2019|access-date=17 November 2019|archive-date=17 November 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191117014529/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/prince-andrew-interview-pizza-express-virginia-roberts-guiffre-jeffrey-epstein-newsnight-a9205916.html|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Prince Andrew denies sex with 17-year-old: 'I went to Pizza Express that day'|url=https://news.sky.com/story/prince-andrew-denies-sex-with-17-year-old-i-went-to-pizza-express-that-day-11862902|work=[[Sky News]]|date=16 November 2019|access-date=17 November 2019|archive-date=17 November 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191117013908/https://news.sky.com/story/prince-andrew-denies-sex-with-17-year-old-i-went-to-pizza-express-that-day-11862902|url-status=live}}</ref> The Duke said that he had "no recollection of ever meeting" Roberts Giuffre<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTaWzBBf6xo|title=Prince Andrew says he has "no recollection" of meeting Epstein accuser|via=www.youtube.com|access-date=17 November 2019|archive-date=17 November 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191117012002/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTaWzBBf6xo|url-status=live}}</ref> and that he had "absolutely no memory" of a photograph taken of him with Roberts Giuffre at [[Ghislaine Maxwell|Ghislaine Maxwell's]] house.

==Accusations of bias==
{{main|BBC bias}}
In April 2001, the [[Board of Governors of the BBC|BBC's governors]] ruled that ''Newsnight'''s coverage of [[Peter Mandelson]]'s resignation over [[Hinduja Group#2001 Hinduja affair|the Hinduja affair]] had been politically biased. The governors criticised the programme for only featuring [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] supporters on the panel discussing the issue, and no opposition politicians appeared at any stage of the 45-minute episode. The broadcast attracted an outcry in the media with one critic describing it as a whitewash worthy of a "[[one-party state]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1317114/BBC-admits-Labour-bias-on-Newsnight-broadcast.html|title=BBC admits Labour bias on Newsnight broadcast|website=The Daily Telegraph|access-date=2 April 2018|archive-date=1 June 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170601000146/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1317114/BBC-admits-Labour-bias-on-Newsnight-broadcast.html|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.questia.com/read/1G1-74928705|title=BBC Guilty of Bias over Mandelson|website=Questia}}</ref>

In May 2020, Newsnight presenter Emily Maitlis broke the BBC's rules on impartiality, by declaring as a fact at the start of the programme that Dominic Cummings had broken the coronavirus lockdown rules and that the country was universally outraged, despite this being a matter of opinion on which different people will disagree. The BBC said that while the programme contained fair, reasonable and rigorous journalism, it was not made clear that the remarks referred to the upcoming content of the programme.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-52824508 |title=Archived copy |access-date=29 May 2020 |archive-date=28 May 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200528230245/https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-52824508 |url-status=live }}</ref>

==Coverage of sexual abuse scandals==
{{main|Jimmy Savile sexual abuse scandal}}
In the weeks after the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] documentary ''[[Exposure (UK TV series)|Exposure]]: The Other Side of [[Jimmy Savile]]'' was broadcast on 3 October 2012, allegations were made that a ''Newsnight'' investigation into Savile by reporter [[Liz MacKean]] and producer [[Meirion Jones]] in December 2011 had been dropped shortly before transmission because it conflicted with tribute programmes prepared after Savile's death.  The BBC appointed [[Nick Pollard]], a former [[Sky News]] executive, to examine why the investigation was dropped.<ref>{{cite news |last=Mason |first=Rowena |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/9613014/BBCs-Jimmy-Savile-probe-to-be-led-by-Harold-Shipman-inquiry-judge.html |title=BBC's Jimmy Savile probe to be led by Harold Shipman inquiry judge |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |date=16 October 2012 |accessdate=16 October 2012 |location=London |archive-date=13 April 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190413164829/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/9613014/BBCs-Jimmy-Savile-probe-to-be-led-by-Harold-Shipman-inquiry-judge.html |url-status=live }}</ref> On 23 October, the [[Director-General of the BBC]], [[George Entwistle]], appeared before the Parliamentary [[Culture, Media and Sport Committee]], and stated that it had been a "catastrophic mistake" to cancel the ''Newsnight'' broadcast.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/jimmy-savile/9628228/Jimmy-Savile-George-Entwistle-heckled-by-BBC-reporters-after-brutal-grilling-from-MPs.html|title=Jimmy Savile: George Entwistle heckled by BBC reporters after brutal grilling from MPs|work=The Telegraph|date=23 October 2012|accessdate=23 October 2012|location=London|first=Rosa|last=Prince|archive-date=24 October 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121024150731/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/jimmy-savile/9628228/Jimmy-Savile-George-Entwistle-heckled-by-BBC-reporters-after-brutal-grilling-from-MPs.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

''Newsnight'' broadcast on 2 November 2012 a report falsely accusing (but not naming) a prominent Conservative, [[Alistair McAlpine, Baron McAlpine of West Green|Lord McAlpine]] of child abuse.

The Pollard report was published on 19 December 2012.

==''Newsnight Review''==
From 2000 until December 2009, on Friday evenings ''Newsnight'' gave way at 11:00pm to ''[[The Review Show|Newsnight Review]]'', a 35-minute consumer survey of the week's artistic and cultural highlights. [[Mark Lawson]] was the programme's main presenter in its ''Late Review'' incarnation, which began life as a strand of ''[[The Late Show (BBC TV series)|The Late Show]]''. He continued to chair the panel of guest reviewers when it reincarnated as ''Newsnight Review'' in 2000, up until December 2005. The programme was presented by [[Kirsty Wark]], [[Martha Kearney]], [[John Wilson (broadcaster)|John Wilson]], [[Tim Marlow]], [[Kwame Kwei-Armah]] and [[Hardeep Singh Kohli]]. Regular reviewers included [[Mark Kermode]], [[Tom Paulin]], [[Ekow Eshun]] and [[Germaine Greer]].

As part of the BBC's commitment to moving programmes out of London, ''Newsnight Review'' finished on 18 December 2009 with a special hour-long edition. The programme was replaced by ''[[The Review Show]]'', produced from Glasgow, which started on 22 January 2010.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/newsnight/review/default.stm|title=A decade of Newsnight Review|date=18 January 2010|work=Newsnight Review|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=22 January 2010|archive-date=15 February 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090215134014/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/newsnight/review/default.stm|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/newsnight/review/8413820.stm|title=Friday 18 December: The year in Review|date=17 December 2009|work=Newsnight Review|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=22 January 2010}}</ref> It had the same producer as ''Newsnight Review'' and was still presented by [[Kirsty Wark]] and [[Martha Kearney]].

==Frivolity==
Traditionally, there was a short stock market update at the end of each edition. In 2005, ''Newsnight's'' then editor, [[Peter Barron]], replaced it with a 30-second weather report, arguing that the market data was available on the internet and that a weather report would be more useful. The change provoked a flurry of complaints.

Paxman on one occasion adopted a sarcastic tone and announced: "So finally and controversially, tomorrow's weather forecast. It's a veritable smorgasbord. Sun, rain, thunder, hail, snow, cold, wind. Almost worth going to work."  On other occasions: "It's April, what do you expect?" and, "Take an umbrella with you tomorrow." He claimed, nonetheless, that he was happy presenting the weather. Gavin Esler also joined in, announcing: "As for the spring, you can forget about that until further notice."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/newsnight/4432141.stm|title=Weather or markets? You decide|website=BBC News|access-date=25 October 2007|archive-date=21 February 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060221002413/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/newsnight/4432141.stm|url-status=live}}</ref> The programme conducted a telephone poll. [[Michael Fish]], a former [[weather forecaster]], was seen arguing in favour of the weather report, while [[Norman Lamont]], a former [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]], argued for the market update. 62% of viewers voted in favour of the markets, and the update duly returned on Monday 18 April 2005.

Other stunts include: for a week at the end of January 2006, ''Newsnight'' played over its closing credits the so-called [[Radio 4 UK Theme]] which was facing the axe; the edition of 24 April 2006 played out to the signature tune of the soon-to-be-axed BBC sports programme, ''[[Grandstand (TV series)|Grandstand]]''.

Between January and June 2006 the programme included ''Gordaq'', a spoof [[stock market index]] measuring the political performance of [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] [[Gordon Brown]]. The index started at 100 and moved up or down depending on Brown's political situation, finishing at 101 on 30 June 2006.

In an [[early day motion]] of 3 November 2016, as a celebration of the [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|"Brexit" vote]] for [[Brexit|UK withdrawal]] from the [[European Union]], right-wing [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] MP [[Andrew Rosindell]] argued for a return to the broadcasting of "[[God Save the Queen]]" at the end of [[BBC One]] transmissions each day. The practice was dropped in 1997 (ostensibly due to BBC One adopting 24-hour broadcasting by simulcasting [[BBC News (TV channel)|BBC News 24]] overnight, rendering [[closedown]] obsolete).<ref>{{cite news|last=Hughes|first=Laura|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/11/03/tory-mp-calls-for-bbc-1-to-mark-brexit-with-national-anthem-at-t/|title=Tory MP calls for BBC 1 to mark Brexit with national anthem at the end of each day|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=3 November 2016|accessdate=3 November 2016|archive-date=3 November 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161103094333/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/11/03/tory-mp-calls-for-bbc-1-to-mark-brexit-with-national-anthem-at-t/|url-status=live}}</ref> That evening, ''Newsnight'' ended its broadcast with host of that night Kirsty Wark saying that they were "incredibly happy to oblige" Rosindell's request, before playing out to the video of the [[Sex Pistols]]' [[God Save the Queen (Sex Pistols song)|punk song of the same name]], much to Rosindell's discontent.<ref name="metro-gstq-troll">{{cite news | url = http://metro.co.uk/2016/11/04/bbc-just-trolled-a-conservative-mp-brilliantly-with-god-save-the-queen-6234486/ | title = BBC just trolled a conservative MP brilliantly with God Save the Queen | first = Simon | last = Robb | newspaper = [[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]] | date = 4 November 2016 | accessdate = 4 November 2016 | archive-date = 4 November 2016 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20161104204428/http://metro.co.uk/2016/11/04/bbc-just-trolled-a-conservative-mp-brilliantly-with-god-save-the-queen-6234486/ | url-status = live }}</ref>

==International edition and other media==
''Newsnight'' is available in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] on [[BBC iPlayer]] for up to thirty days after broadcast.  A weekly digest version of ''Newsnight'' is screened on [[BBC World News]], focusing on "the best of the week's films and discussions."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episodes/b006mk25/newsnight|title=Newsnight on BBC iPlayer|website=BBC|access-date=22 March 2019|archive-date=26 March 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190326073449/https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episodes/b006mk25/newsnight|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/n13xtmdh|title=BBC World News version of Newsnight|website=BBC|access-date=23 March 2019|archive-date=25 March 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190325043055/https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/n13xtmdh|url-status=live}}</ref>

[[BBC America]] axed its US version of ''Newsnight'' as part of a series of changes that included dropping its daily three-hour block of international news.

[[KCET]], an independent public television station in [[Los Angeles]], broadcasts the weekly digest version.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kcet.org/shows/bbc_newsnight|title=KCET version of Newsnight|website=KCET|access-date=31 July 2010|archive-date=11 August 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100811054642/http://www.kcet.org/shows/bbc_newsnight/|url-status=live}}</ref>
