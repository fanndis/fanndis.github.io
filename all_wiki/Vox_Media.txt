==History==

=== Founding and expansion in sports media ===
Vox Media was founded in 2005 as SportsBlogs Inc., the parent company of the sports [[blog]] network ''[[SB Nation]]'', by political strategist [[Jerome Armstrong]], freelance writer [[Tyler Bleszinski]], and [[Daily Kos]] creator [[Markos Moulitsas]].<ref name="auto" /> The site was a spin-off and expansion of Bleszinski's [[Oakland Athletics]]-focused blog ''Athletics Nation'', which sought to provide coverage of the baseball team from a fan's perspective.<ref name="bi-raidedaol" /> The popularity of the site led to other sports blogs being incorporated.<ref name="bi-raidedaol">{{cite news |title=The Raid On AOL: How Vox Pillaged Engadget And Founded An Empire |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/vox-2012-1 |access-date=January 20, 2016 |work=Business Insider |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6GLzmAn0n?url=http://www.businessinsider.com/vox-2012-1 |archive-date=May 4, 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref>

In 2008, SB Nation hired former [[AOL]] executive [[Jim Bankoff]] as CEO to assist in its growth. He showed interest in ''SB Nation''{{'s}} goal of building a network of niche-oriented sports websites.<ref name="bi-raidedaol" /><ref name="inc-interview">{{cite web |url=http://www.inc.com/news/articles/2010/08/interview-with-jim-bankoff-ceo-of-sbnation.html |title=Interview with Jim Bankoff, CEO of SBNation.com |work=Inc.com |access-date=September 4, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150828233602/http://www.inc.com/news/articles/2010/08/interview-with-jim-bankoff-ceo-of-sbnation.html |archive-date=August 28, 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref> By February 2009, the ''SB Nation'' network contained 185 blogs, and in November 2010, [[ComScore]] estimated that the site had attracted 5.8&nbsp;million unique visitors.<ref name=":0" /> The 208 percent increase in unique visitors over November 2009 made ''SB Nation'' the fastest-growing sports website the company tracked at the time.<ref name=":0">{{cite news |title=SB Nation's sports blogger collective sees bias as a plus |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/12/17/AR2010121706202.html |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=December 20, 2010 |access-date=January 8, 2010 |first=Steven |last=Overly |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141230231159/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/12/17/AR2010121706202.html |archive-date=December 30, 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref>

=== Continued growth and expansion into other content areas ===
In 2011, Bankoff hired a number of former writers from AOL's technology blog ''[[Engadget]]'', including former editor-in-chief [[Joshua Topolsky]], to build a new technology-oriented website that was in the same network as ''SB Nation''.<ref name="bi-raidedaol" />  These writers had originally left AOL following a series of conflicts between Topolsky and [[Michael Arrington]], author of ''[[TechCrunch]]'' (which AOL had recently acquired), and the leak of an internal training document that outlined a content strategy for AOL's blogs that prioritized profitability.<ref name=":1" /> Bankoff felt that a technology-oriented website would complement ''SB Nation'' due to their overlapping demographics.<ref name="inc-interview" /> In November, the renamed Vox Media officially launched ''[[The Verge]]'', with Topolsky as editor-in-chief.<ref name="inc-interview" /><ref name=":1">{{cite web |url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2383012,00.asp |title=Engadget's Topolsky, Former Editors Starting New Rival Tech Site |last1=Albanesius |first1=Chloe |date=April 4, 2011 |work=[[PC Magazine]] |publisher=[[Ziff Davis]] |access-date=May 4, 2013 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6GMBTfqpG?url=http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2383012,00.asp |archive-date=May 4, 2013 |url-status=live}}</ref>

In 2012, Vox Media launched a video gaming website, ''[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]'', led by former ''[[Joystiq]]'' editor Christopher Grant.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/briansolomon/2012/10/24/the-inside-story-of-polygon-the-verges-new-gaming-sister-site/ |title=The Inside Story Of Polygon, The Verge's New Gaming Sister-Site |author=Brian Solomon |work=Forbes |access-date=September 4, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140731022204/http://www.forbes.com/sites/briansolomon/2012/10/24/the-inside-story-of-polygon-the-verges-new-gaming-sister-site/ |archive-date=July 31, 2014 |url-status=live}}</ref> In November 2013, Vox Media acquired Curbed Network, which consisted of the [[real-estate]] blog network ''[[Curbed]]'', the food blog ''[[Eater (website)|Eater]]'', and the fashion blog ''Racked''.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/11/business/media/vox-media-buying-curbedcom-network-of-sites.html?smid=tw-share&_r=0 |title=Vox Media Buying Curbed.com Network of Sites |work=[[New York Times]] |date=November 10, 2013 |access-date=November 10, 2013 |author=Kaufman, Leslie |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131114144918/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/11/business/media/vox-media-buying-curbedcom-network-of-sites.html?smid=tw-share&_r=0 |archive-date=November 14, 2013 |url-status=live}}</ref>

In May 2015, Vox Media acquired ''[[Recode]]'', a technology industry news website that was founded by [[Walt Mossberg]] and [[Kara Swisher]], the former editors of ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''{{'}}s ''[[All Things Digital]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/27/business/media/vox-media-acquiring-recode.html?_r=1 |access-date=May 29, 2015 |title=Vox Media Adds ReCode to Its Stable of Websites |last1=Ember |first1=Sydney |date=May 26, 2014 |work=[[The New York Times]] |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6YpNXfmQl?url=http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/27/business/media/vox-media-acquiring-recode.html?_r=1 |archive-date=May 27, 2015 |url-status=live}}</ref>

In May 2017, Vox Media announced that it had entered into an agreement to provide technology and advertising sales for [[Bill Simmons]]' sports website ''[[The Ringer (website)|The Ringer]]'', as part of a revenue sharing agreement.<ref>{{cite web |title=Bill Simmons' The Ringer Inks Advertising, Tech Pact With Vox Media |url=https://variety.com/2017/digital/news/bill-simmons-vox-media-advertising-technology-1202447469/ |website=Variety |access-date=May 30, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170530122454/http://variety.com/2017/digital/news/bill-simmons-vox-media-advertising-technology-1202447469/ |archive-date=May 30, 2017 |url-status=live}}</ref>

In February 2018, it was reported that Vox Media would be laying off around 50 employees, particularly surrounding video production. CEO Jim Bankoff stated previously that the company planned to exit [[native video]] for [[Facebook]] due to "unreliable monetization and promotion". The memo announcing the layoffs argued that despite its success, native video "won't be viable audience or revenue growth drivers for us relative to other investments we are making", and that the company wanted to focus more on podcasting and Vox Entertainment.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/vox-media-laying-around-50-people-1086869 |title=Vox Media Laying Off Around 50 Staffers |work=The Hollywood Reporter |access-date=February 21, 2018 |language=en |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180221145119/https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/vox-media-laying-around-50-people-1086869 |archive-date=February 21, 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref> The layoffs represented around 5% of Vox's workforce.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://variety.com/2018/digital/news/vox-media-layoffs-50-employees-1202706362/ |title=Vox Media Lays Off 50 Staffers, or 5% of Workforce |last=Spangler |first=Todd |date=February 21, 2018 |work=Variety |access-date=March 13, 2018 |language=en-US |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180314104411/http://variety.com/2018/digital/news/vox-media-layoffs-50-employees-1202706362/ |archive-date=March 14, 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref>
