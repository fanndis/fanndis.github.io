He was first elected on 20 September 2014 and was re-elected in the 28 September 2019 presidential election. He was announced the winner after a protracted process in February 2020 and was sworn in for a second term on 9 March 2020. An [[Anthropology|anthropologist]] by education, he previously served as [[Ministry of Finance (Afghanistan)|Minister of Finance]] and the [[Chancellor (education)|Chancellor]] of [[Kabul University]].

Before returning to [[Afghanistan]] in 2002, Ghani was a professor of anthropology at numerous institutions (mostly [[Johns Hopkins University]]), and later started working with the [[World Bank]]. As the Finance Minister of Afghanistan between July 2002 and December 2004, he led Afghanistan's attempted economic recovery after the collapse of the [[Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan|Taliban government]].

He is the [[co-founder]] of the [[Institute for State Effectiveness]], an organization set up in 2005 to improve the ability of states to serve their citizens. In 2005 he gave a [[TED talk]], in which he discussed how to rebuild a broken state such as [[Islamic Republic of Afghanistan|Afghanistan]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ted.com/talks/ashraf_ghani_on_rebuilding_broken_states|title=Ashraf Ghani: How to rebuild a broken state - TED Talk - TED.com|author=Ashraf Ghani|work=ted.com|access-date=2 December 2015}}</ref> He is a member of the [[Commission on Legal Empowerment of the Poor]], an independent initiative hosted by the [[United Nations Development Programme]].

As a foreign exchange student, Ashraf attended [[Lake Oswego High School]] in [[Lake Oswego, Oregon|Lake Oswego]], [[Oregon]] and graduated with the class of 1967. He initially wanted to study Law but then changed his major to [[Cultural Anthropology]]. Ghani attended the [[American University in Beirut]] where he earned his bachelor's degree in 1973, and after that, attended [[Columbia University]], where he earned his master's degree in 1977, and a [[PhD]] degree in 1983. He met his future wife, [[Rula Ghani|Rula]], while studying there.<ref name="Britannica"/>

==Academic career==
Following his bachelor's degree, he served on the faculty of [[Kabul University]] (1973–77) and [[Aarhus University]] in [[Denmark]] (1977). Following his PhD degree, he was invited to teach at [[University of California, Berkeley]] in 1983, and then at [[Johns Hopkins University]] from 1983 to 1991. He has also attended the [[Harvard]]-[[INSEAD]] and [[World Bank]]-[[Stanford Graduate School of Business]]'s leadership training program. His academic research was on state-building and social transformation. In 1985, he completed a year of fieldwork researching [[Madrassas in Pakistan|Pakistani madrassas]] as a [[Fulbright Scholar]].<ref name="Britannica"/>

==World Bank==
He joined the [[World Bank]] in 1991, working on projects in [[East Asia|East]] and [[South Asia]] during the mid-1990s.<ref name="Britannica"/>

==Political career==
Returning to Afghanistan after 24 years in December 2001, Ghani left his posts at the UN and World Bank to join the new [[Politics of Afghanistan|Afghan government]] as the chief advisor to [[List of leaders of Afghanistan|President]] [[Hamid Karzai]] on 1 February 2002.

After leaving Kabul University, Ghani co-founded the [[Institute for State Effectiveness]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://isecenter.org|title=Institute for State Effectiveness|access-date=2 December 2015}}</ref> with [[Clare Lockhart]], of which he was Chairman. The Institute put forward a framework proposing that the state should perform ten functions in order to serve its citizens. This framework was discussed by leaders and managers of post-conflict transitions at a meeting sponsored by the UN and World Bank in September 2005. The program proposed that double compacts between the international community, government and the population of a country could be used as a basis for organizing aid and other interventions, and that an annual sovereignty index to measure state effectiveness be compiled.

Ghani was tipped as a candidate to succeed [[Kofi Annan]] as [[Secretary General of the United Nations]] at the end of 2006<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unic.un.org.pl/sekretarz/wybory.php |title=Sekretarz generalny ONZ. Wybory 2006 |publisher=Unic.un.org.pl |access-date=29 March 2013}}</ref> in a front-page report in [[The Financial Times]] that quoted him as saying, "I hope to win, through ideas." Carlos Pascual of the Brookings Institution was also quoted, praising Ghani's "tremendous intellect, talent and capacity."<ref>{{cite web|title=Ghani joins race to succeed Annan|url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/285df5a2-4673-11db-ac52-0000779e2340.html#axzz3IsFBjQMM|work=Financial Times|access-date=12 November 2014}}</ref>

In 2005, Ghani gave keynote speeches for meetings including the [[American Bar Association]]'s International Rule of Law Symposium, the Trans-Atlantic Policy Network, the annual meeting of the [[Norway|Norwegian]] Government's development staff, CSIS's meeting on UN reform, the UN–OECD–World Bank's meeting on Fragile States and TEDGlobal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://truetalk.typepad.com/truetalk/2005/07/ted_global__day_1.html|work=The TrueTalk Blog|title=Ted Global – Day 1|access-date=2 December 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151004060320/http://truetalk.typepad.com/truetalk/2005/07/ted_global__day_1.html|archive-date=4 October 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> He contributed to the ''[[Financial Times]]'', ''[[International Herald Tribune]]'', ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', and ''[[The Washington Post]]''.

===Finance Minister of Afghanistan===
He carried out extensive reforms, including issuing a new currency, computerizing treasury operations, instituting a single treasury account, adopting a policy of balanced budgets and using budgets as the central policy instrument, centralizing revenue collection, tariff reform and overhauling customs. He instituted regular reporting to the cabinet, the public and international stakeholders as a tool of transparency and accountability, and required donors to focus their interventions on three sectors, improving accountability with government counterparts and preparing a development strategy that held Afghans more accountable for their own future development.

Poverty eradication through wealth creation and the establishment of citizens' rights is the heart of Ghani's development approach. The [[Afghan National Solidarity Programme|National Solidarity Program]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nspafghanistan.org/|title=National Solidarity Program|access-date=14 September 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929075620/http://www.nspafghanistan.org/|archive-date=29 September 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref> covers 13,000 of the country's estimated 20,000 villages.

===Reconstruction===
On 28 January 2010, Ghani attended the [[International Conference on Afghanistan London 2010|International Conference on Afghanistan in London]], pledging his support to help rebuild their country. Ghani presented his ideas to Karzai as an example of the importance of cooperation among Afghans and with the international community, supporting Karzai's reconciliation strategy.

After none of the candidates managed to win more than 50% of the vote in the first round of the election, Ghani and Abdullah Abdullah, the two front runners from the first round, contested in a run-off election, which was held on 14 June 2014.

Initial results from the run-off elections showed Ghani as the overwhelming favourite to win the elections. However, allegations of electoral fraud resulted in a stalemate, threats of violence and the formation of a parallel government by the camp of his opponent, Abdullah Abdullah. On 7 August 2014 US Secretary of State John Kerry flew to Kabul to broker a deal that outlined an extensive audit of nearly 8 million votes and formation of a national unity government with a new role for a [[Chief Executive Officer (Afghanistan)|chief executive officer]] who would carry out meaningful functions within the president's administration. After a three-month audit process, which was supervised by the United Nations with financial support from the U.S. government, the Independent Election Commission announced Ghani as President after Ghani agreed to a national unity deal. Initially, the election commission said it would not formally announce specific results. It later released a statement that said Ghani managed to secure 55.4% and Abdullah Abdullah secured 43.5% of the vote, although it declined to release the individual vote results. In September 2019,  an explosion near an election rally attended by President Ashraf Ghani killed 24 people and injured 31 others, but Ghani was unhurt.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-afghanistan-election-blast-idUSKBN1W20UA|title=Blast kills 24 at Afghan election rally, aide says president unhurt|date=17 September 2019|work=Reuters|access-date=17 September 2019|language=en}}</ref>

=== Economy and trade ===
During his tenure, Ghani has strengthened ties with [[Central Asia]]n countries such as Uzbekistan, with which it has made deals to increase mutual trading.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://thediplomat.com/2017/12/ghani-and-mirziyoyev-meet-renew-afghan-uzbek-ties/|title=Ghani and Mirziyoyev Meet, Renew Afghan-Uzbek Ties|first=Catherine Putz, The|last=Diplomat}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://tashkenttimes.uz/economy/1038-uzbekistan-afghanistan-readying-agreement-on-trade-and-cooperation-in-transit-of-goods|title=Uzbekistan, Afghanistan readying agreement on trade and cooperation in transit of goods|last=akbaryusupov}}</ref> New trade routes have also been launched within the wider region.

===Relations with Pakistan===
Since his election, Ghani wanted to improve relations with [[Pakistan]], which in turn could pave the way for peace talks with the Taliban. He made his first visit to Pakistan on 14 November 2014, meeting Prime Minister [[Nawaz Sharif]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/nov/14/afghan-president-ashraf-ghani-islamabad-pakistan-taliban|title=Afghan president Ashraf Ghani arrives in Islamabad to build Pakistan ties|first=Agence France-Presse in|last=Islamabad|date=14 November 2014|website=the Guardian}}</ref> However, after many terror attacks in Afghanistan which were largely blamed on Pakistan, and failed Taliban peace talks, Ghani grew increasingly cold to Pakistan.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/183085-Ghani-and-Pakistan|title=Ghani and Pakistan|website=www.thenews.com.pk}}</ref> Ghani claimed that Pakistan had hit an "undeclared war of aggression" against Afghanistan.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-06-06/ghani-says-afghanistan-suffering-undeclared-war-from-pakistan|title=Ghani Says Afghanistan Hit by 'Undeclared War' From Pakistan|date=6 June 2017|via=www.bloomberg.com}}</ref> Following two deadly Taliban/[[Haqqani network|Haqqani]] attacks in Kabul in January 2018, Ghani called Pakistan the "center of the Taliban".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tolonews.com/index.php/afghanistan/pakistan-center-taliban-ghani-tells-nation|title=Pakistan Is The Center Of Taliban, Ghani Tells The Nation|publisher=TOLOnews}}</ref> [[Tolo News]] while quoting an unnamed source alleged that Ashraf Ghani had refused to take a call from the Pakistani prime minister, instead he sent a [[National Directorate of Security|NDS]] delegation to hand over evidence that the terrorists were supported by Pakistan.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/defence/afghan-president-speaks-to-modi-not-to-pakistan-pm/articleshow/62724174.cms|title=Afghan President speaks to Modi, not to Pakistan PM|date=16 April 2018|via=The Economic Times|access-date=2 February 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180203064049/https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/defence/afghan-president-speaks-to-modi-not-to-pakistan-pm/articleshow/62724174.cms|archive-date=3 February 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref> However, Afghan envoy [[Omar Zakhilwal]] rejected such reports regarding Ghani's phone call rejection with Pakistan prime minister.

==Controversy==
On 2 February 2020, Ashraf Ghani made controversial remarks while talking about [[Timur]] and [[Muhammad of Ghor]]<ref>{{cite news|url=https://8am.af/is-the-ethnic-look-correct-in-the-history-of-the-region/|title=Is the ethnic look correct in the history of the region?|newspaper=8am.af|lang=fa|access-date=2 February 2020}}</ref> which angered the [[Uzbeks|Uzbek]] population of Afghanistan.<ref name=remark2/> He made those remarks while delivering a speech to a group of Afghan students on History, Culture, and the National Identity.<ref name=remark2/><ref name=remark/> Ghani stated that Muhammad of Ghor destroyed Afghanistan’s central irrigation system while [[Genghis Khan]] demolished the irrigation system of the northern provinces. He also taunted Amir Timur by calling him ‘lame’ and stated that Timur wiped-out the irrigation system for Sistan, [[Farah Province|Farah]], and [[Helmand]] provinces.<ref name=remark/> His remarks regarding Timur were considered highly offensive to Uzbeks, according to experts, which drew wide spread condemnation from Afghanistan's [[Uzbeks]] population.<ref name=remark2/>

Following his remarks, residents of [[Faryab province]] staged protests and demanded an apology from Ashraf Ghani. The protesters threatened that they would take serious action if Ghani did not apologize for his remarks.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2189739958002031&id=1567827743526592|title=Faryab resident protest|lang=fa|date=2 February 2020|newspaper=Aamaj News}}</ref> [[Abdul Rashid Dostum]], former vice president of Afghanistan and an ethnic Uzbek, also demanded an apology from Ashraf Ghani. Bashir Ahmad Tahyanj, spokesperson of the National Islamic Movement of Afghanistan, said that "Ghani has a personal bias towards historic figures, honorable ethnicities, the history and culture of the people who live in Afghanistan. This is not his first time.”<ref name=remark2/> However, the Afghan government palace in a statement defended Ghani's remarks and stated that 'what Ghani said about Timur was not offensive or insulting'.<ref name=remark>{{cite news|url=https://www.khaama.com/ghanis-remarks-about-timur-gurkani-sparked-anger-among-afghanistans-uzbeks-789797909/|title=Ghani's remarks about Timur Gurkani spark anger among Afghanistan's Uzbeks|newspaper=Khaama Press|date=2 February 2020}}</ref><ref name=remark2>{{cite news|url=https://ariananews.af/insulting-any-tribe-ethnicity-group-is-offensive-by-law/|title=Insulting any tribe, ethnicity, group, is offensive by law|newspaper=Arina News|date=2 February 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://reporterly.net/live/newsfeed/sunday-february-2-2020/dustom-calls-on-president-ghani-to-apologize-for-his-remarks-about-uzbeks/|title=Dustom Calls on President Ghani to Apologize For His Remarks About Uzbeks|date=2 February 2020|publisher=Reporterly.net}}</ref>
