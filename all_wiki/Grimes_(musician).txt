According to the timestamps on her original [[Myspace]] page, Boucher began writing music under the name Grimes in 2007. Her performer name was chosen because at the time, MySpace allowed artists to list three musical genres. She listed [[Grime (music genre)|grime]] for all three, before knowing what grime music was.<ref name="seanmichaels">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/dec/22/grimes-admits-moniker-grime-genre-option-myspace|title=Grimes admits lifting moniker from grime genre option on Myspace|first=Sean|last=Michaels|work=the Guardian|access-date=May 8, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150524175427/http://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/dec/22/grimes-admits-moniker-grime-genre-option-myspace|archive-date=May 24, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://myspace.com/grimesgrime/music/album/lethe-2016469|title=lethe|date=December 18, 2007|access-date=May 7, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160611205916/https://myspace.com/grimesgrime/music/album/lethe-2016469|archive-date=June 11, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> Grimes is self-taught in music and visual art.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/grimes-the-triumph-of-a-self-made-oddball-20151105|title=Grimes: The Triumph of a Self-Made Oddball|work=Rolling Stone|access-date=August 23, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170820040853/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/grimes-the-triumph-of-a-self-made-oddball-20151105|archive-date=August 20, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.vogue.com/article/grimes-art-angels-album-hair-color-purple-beauty-makeup-personal-style|title=Grimes On Her New Scene-Stealing Look—And Why Instagram is Killing Her Hair Color Vibe|work=Vogue|access-date=August 23, 2017|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170823203901/http://www.vogue.com/article/grimes-art-angels-album-hair-color-purple-beauty-makeup-personal-style|archive-date=August 23, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

After the release of ''Halfaxa'', Boucher began publicly promoting Grimes and started touring beyond Montreal. In 2011 Boucher released five songs on her side of the split [[12"]] with [[d'Eon (musician)|d'Eon]], ''[[Darkbloom]]'' (through both [[Arbutus Records|Arbutus]] and [[Hippos in Tanks]]).
