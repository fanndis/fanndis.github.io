'''Xfinity''' is the [[trade name]] of '''Comcast Cable Communications, LLC''', a subsidiary of [[Comcast|Comcast Corporation]], used to market consumer [[cable television]], [[Cable Internet access|internet]], [[telephone]], and wireless services provided by the company. The brand was first introduced in 2010; prior to that, these services were marketed primarily under the Comcast name.

Its CEO is Dave Watson, its chairman is [[Brian L.

In February 2010, Comcast began to re-brand its consumer [[Triple play (telecommunications)|triple play]] service offerings under the name Xfinity; Comcast Digital Cable was renamed "Xfinity TV", Comcast Digital Voice became "Xfinity Voice", and Comcast High Speed Internet became "Xfinity Internet". The re-branding and an associated promotional campaign were scheduled to coincide with the [[2010 Winter Olympics]].<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.boston.com/business/technology/articles/2010/02/13/comcast_enters_rebranding_territory/ |title= Comcast enters rebranding territory |author=Bray, Hiawatha |newspaper=[[The Boston Globe]] |date= February 13, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Fernandez |first=Bob |url=http://www.philly.com/philly/business/technology/20100203_Comcast_4Q_profit_up_on_revenue_boost__tax_gain.html |title=Comcast unveils new brand name and logo |work=[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]] |date=February 3, 2010 |access-date=March 15, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100411070805/http://www.philly.com/philly/business/technology/20100203_Comcast_4Q_profit_up_on_revenue_boost__tax_gain.html |archive-date=April 11, 2010 }}</ref>

Comcast is the largest provider of [[cable internet access]] in the United States, servicing 40% of the market in 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.leichtmanresearch.com/press/031412release.html|title=3 MILLION ADDED BROADBAND FROM TOP CABLE AND TELEPHONE COMPANIES IN 2011|publisher=Leichtman Research Group|date=March 16, 2012|accessdate=March 10, 2014}}</ref> As of July 26, 2018, Comcast has 26.5 million high-speed internet customers.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://seekingalpha.com/news/3374316-comcast-plus-3_6-percent-internet-subs-spur-healthy-profit | title=Comcast +3.6% as Internet subs spur healthy profit| date=2018-07-26}}</ref>
Comcast began offering internet services in late 1996, when it helped found the [[@Home Network]], which sold internet service through Comcast's cable lines.

In 2011, Comcast launched its "Internet Essentials" program, which offers low-cost internet service to families with children who qualify for free or reduced price school lunches. The [[U.S. Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) required this budget service as a condition for allowing Comcast's acquisition of [[NBCUniversal]] in January 2011.<ref name=PCMagLaunch>{{cite web|url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2390592,00.asp|title=Comcast Launches Low-Cost Internet for Low-Income Families|publisher=PC Magazine|author=David Murphy|date=August 7, 2011|accessdate=February 14, 2014}}</ref> Of an estimated 2.60 million households eligible for the program, about 220,000 households participate in the program as of June 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://corporate.comcast.com/images/MB-10-56-C-NBCU-Annual-Compliance-Report-2013-2014-02-28.pdf|title=SECOND ANNUAL COMPLIANCE REPORT ON INTERNET ESSENTIALS(pp 10)|publisher=Comcast|date=July 31, 2013|accessdate=March 19, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://business.time.com/2012/09/20/why-arent-more-families-signing-up-for-cheap-internet-service/|title=Why Aren't More Families Signing Up for Cheap Internet Service?|publisher=Time|author=Brad Tuttle|date=September 20, 2012|accessdate=March 5, 2014}}</ref><ref name=NYT012013>{{cite news|title=Mixed Response to Comcast in Expanding Net Access|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/21/business/media/comcast-internet-essentials-brings-access-to-low-income-homes.html|accessdate=January 21, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=January 20, 2013|last=Chozick |first=Amy}}</ref> A similar program is available from other internet providers through the non-profit Connect2compete.org.<ref name=NYT012013 /><ref name = c2c >[http://www.connect2compete.org/ Homepage connect2compete.org] accessed January 21, 2013</ref> Comcast has stated that the program will accept new customers for a total of three years.<ref name=PCMagLaunch /> In March 2014, as he met with FCC concerning the Time Warner Cable merger, Comcast vice president David Cohen told reporters that the internet essentials program will be extended indefinitely.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-03-04/comcast-pledges-low-cost-web-as-it-meets-on-time-warner.html|title=Comcast Pledges Low-Cost Web as It Meets on Time Warner|publisher=Bloomberg L.P.|author=Todd Shields|date=March 4, 2014|accessdate=March 5, 2014}}</ref>

At the 2017 Consumer Electronics Show, Comcast unveiled a new software platform for its Arris 1682G and Cisco 3941T/3939 modems, which would offer a redesigned configuration interface, support for remote setup and management via an Xfinity mobile app, and enabling integration of supported [[smart home]] devices with other Xfinity platforms such as Xfinity TV. The new platform launched under the brand xFi in May 2017. Comcast also unveiled the xFi Advanced Gateway, a new router designed to facilitate faster Wi-Fi speeds, including support for [[802.11ac]] Wave 2, as well as internal support for [[Bluetooth Low Energy]], [[Thread (network protocol)|Thread]], and [[Zigbee]] for finer integration with [[Internet of things]] devices, and support for an accompanying line of [[Wi-Fi extender]]s (manufactured by Plume).<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.engadget.com/2017/12/06/comcast-xfi-advanced-gateway-available/|title=Comcast's xFi Advanced Gateway modem is now available nationwide|work=Engadget|access-date=May 23, 2018|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/5/8/15578424/comcast-xfi-app-router-announce|title=Comcast is trying to get in on the mesh router hype|work=The Verge|access-date=May 23, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/comcast-launches-xfinity-xfi/|title=Comcast launches Xfinity xFi, turning gateways into Wi-Fi systems|date=May 7, 2017|work=CNET|access-date=May 23, 2018|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/ces-2017-watch-out-wi-fi-systems-comcast-is-transforming-its-xfinity-gateway-to-a-smart-digital-home/|title=Watch out, Wi-Fi systems!

===Xfinity WiFi===
Comcast operates a network of public Wi-Fi hotspots for Xfinity internet subscribers known as Xfinity WiFi, which consists of a mixture of hotspots installed in public locations and businesses, and those generated by supported Xfinity home gateways on an opt-out basis. Users on the "Performance" tier or higher receive unlimited usage of these hotspots after signing in with their Xfinity Account. By default, all dual-band Xfinity home gateways operate both a private network, and a public network with the [[SSID]] "xfinitywifi." To conserve bandwidth, these hotspots are capped at 5 simultaneous users. Customers can opt out of providing Xfinity WiFi through either the Comcast website, or by installing a third-party router.<ref name="extech-wifi">{{cite web|title=Report: Comcast's public Xfinity WiFi program actually costs you money|url=https://www.extremetech.com/computing/185560-new-report-illustrates-how-comcasts-public-xfinity-wifi-program-actually-costs-you-money|website=ExtremeTech|accessdate=April 6, 2017}}</ref><ref name="pcw-wifi">{{cite web|title=To Xfinity WiFi we're all hotspots, but you don't have to be|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/2363389/to-xfinity-wifi-were-all-hotspots-but-you-dont-have-to-be.html|website=PC World|accessdate=April 6, 2017|date=2014-07-02}}</ref>

Comcast has received criticism for this practice, with critics arguing that the company was abusing customer resources (including bandwidth and electricity) to provide services for other customers, as well as concerns regarding security, and liability for actions performed by users while connected to these home hotspots; in 2014, a proposed class action lawsuit was filed in California, citing violations of the [[Computer Fraud and Abuse Act]] and similar state laws for these reasons. Comcast defended the service by stating that the public Wi-Fi is firewalled from devices connected to the in-home network, was designed to have minimal bandwidth impact to "support robust usage", and that customers would not be liable for the actions of other users, as abusers can be traced by means of the Xfinity account they used to sign into the network.<ref name="computerworld-">{{cite web|title=Comcast XFINITY WiFi: Just say no|url=http://www.computerworld.com/article/2476444/mobile-security/mobile-security-comcast-xfinity-wifi-just-say-no.html|website=Computerworld|accessdate=April 6, 2017|date=2014-06-28}}</ref><ref name="ars-wifilawsuit">{{cite web|title=Comcast sued by customers for turning routers into public hotspots|url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2014/12/comcast-sued-by-customers-for-turning-routers-into-public-hotspots/|website=Ars Technica|accessdate=April 6, 2017}}</ref> The lawsuit was taken to arbitration.<ref name="slate-homespot">{{cite web|title=It's Totally Possible That Your Router Is Broadcasting Public Wi-Fi Right Now|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2016/01/28/juniper_research_1_in_3_home_routers_will_also_produce_public_wifi_hotspots.html|website=Slate|accessdate=April 6, 2017|date=2016-01-28}}</ref>

===Data cap===
Initially, Comcast had a policy of terminating broadband customers who use "excessive bandwidth", a term the company refused to define in its terms of service, which once said only that a customer's use should not "represent (in the sole judgment of Comcast) an overly large burden on the network".<ref name="tos">[http://www.comcast.net/terms/use/ Comcast, '&#39;Comcast High-Speed Internet Acceptable Use Policy'&#39;].

Comcast introduced a 250&nbsp;GB monthly [[bandwidth cap]] to its broadband service on October 1, 2008,<ref>[http://www.broadbandreports.com/shownews/Comcast-250GB-Monthly-Cap-Goes-Live-October-1-97294 Comcast 250GB Cap Goes Live October 1].

On April 27, 2016, Comcast announced that it would raise its data threshold in trial markets to 1 TB by June 2016; the company stated that "more than 99 percent of our customers do not come close to using a terabyte." The decision to raise the cap came following implication of increased scrutiny surrounding them by the FCC: in its approval of [[Charter Communications]]' purchase of [[Time Warner Cable]], the Commission stipulated that Charter must not implement caps. As previously, a $10 overage fee is charged for every 50&nbsp;GB above the limit, and customers can purchase an add-on for "unlimited" data, but its price was increased to $50.<ref name="verge-1tbcap">{{cite web|title=Comcast is raising its monthly internet data cap to 1TB|url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/4/27/11521566/comcast-data-cap-raised-1-tb-limit|website=The Verge|publisher=Vox Media|accessdate=April 28, 2016|date=2016-04-27}}</ref> In October 2016, Comcast announced that bandwidth thresholds would be implemented in the majority of its markets (outside of New York and the northeast) beginning November 1, 2016.<ref name="verge-mostcustomers">{{cite web|title=Most Comcast customers now have a 1TB home internet data threshold|url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/6/13192832/comcast-xfinity-home-internet-data-caps-one-terabyte|website=The Verge|accessdate=October 7, 2016|date=2016-10-06}}</ref> The data usage plan does not currently apply to the Gigabit Pro tier of service, Business Internet customers, customers on Bulk Internet agreements, and customers with Prepaid Internet.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://dataplan.xfinity.com/faq/|title=XFINITY Data Usage Center - FAQ|website=Dataplan.xfinity.com|access-date=December 7, 2016}}</ref>

===Network management and peering===
In September 2007, a rumor emerged among tech blogs that Comcast was throttling or even blocking internet traffic transmitted via the [[BitTorrent protocol]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://torrentfreak.com/comcast-throttles-bittorrent-traffic-seeding-impossible/|title=Comcast Throttles BitTorrent Traffic, Seeding Impossible|publisher=TorrentFreak|author=Ernesto|date=August 17, 2007|accessdate=February 25, 2014}}</ref> Comcast vehemently denied the accusations of blocking traffic, stating that "Comcast does not, has not, and will not block any Web sites or online applications, including peer-to-peer services", and that "We engage in reasonable network management".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.internetnews.com/bus-news/article.php/3708751/Comcast+Again+Denies+P2P+Throttling.htm|title=Comcast Again Denies P2P Throttling|publisher=Internet News|author= Andy Patrizio|date=November 2, 2007|accessdate=February 25, 2014}}</ref> After more widespread confirmation that Comcast was throttling BitTorrent traffic,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/21376597/|title=Comcast Blocks Some Internet Traffic|author=Peter Svensson|date=November 19, 2007|accessdate=February 25, 2014}}</ref> Comcast said it occasionally delayed BitTorrent traffic in order to speed up other kinds of data, but declined to go into specifics.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/10/22/comcast-were-delaying-not-blocking-bittorrent-traffic/comment-page-3/|title=Comcast: We're Delaying, Not Blocking, BitTorrent Traffic|publisher=New York Times Bits|author=BRAD STONE|date=October 22, 2007|accessdate=February 25, 2014}}</ref> Following the announcement of an official investigation by the FCC,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2008/01/fcc-to-investigate-comcast-bittorrent-blocking/|title=FCC to investigate Comcast BitTorrent blocking|publisher=ArsTechnica|author=Ryan Paul|date=January 9, 2008|accessdate=February 25, 2014}}</ref> Comcast voluntarily ended the traffic discrimination.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/23831261/|title=Comcast and BitTorrent: Enemies Become "Net-Neutral" Friends|publisher=CNBC|author=Julia Boorstin|date=March 27, 2008|accessdate=February 25, 2014}}</ref> The FCC investigation concluded that Comcast's throttling policies were illegal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-13578_3-10004508-38.html#!|title=FCC formally rules Comcast's throttling of BitTorrent was illegal|publisher=Cnet|author=Declan McCullagh|date=August 1, 2008|accessdate=February 25, 2014}}</ref> However, after filing a lawsuit in September 2008,<ref>[http://www.multichannel.com/content/comcast-sues-fcc-over-network-management-finding Comcast sues FCC over network management finding].

In 2010, [[Netflix]] signed an agreement with [[Level 3 Communications]] to carry its data. Shortly after, Level 3 entered a heated dispute concerning whether Level 3 would have to pay Comcast to bridge their respective networks, in an agreement known as [[peering]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gigaom.com/2010/11/29/level-3-comcast-in-a-cat-fight-over-online-video/|title=Level 3, Comcast in a Cat Fight Over Online Video|publisher=Gigaom|author=Stacey Higginbotham|date=November 29, 2010|accessdate=February 25, 2014}}</ref> The disagreement continued as Netflix's current carrier, [[Cogent Communications]], explicitly placed blame for Netflix bottlenecks on Comcast and several other ISPs.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2014/02/21/netflix-cogent-verizon/|title=Netflix's internet provider claims Verizon, Comcast and Time Warner are causing streaming bottlenecks (update)|publisher=Endgadget|author=Ben Gilbert |date=February 21, 2014|accessdate=February 25, 2014}}</ref> In February 2014, after rumors surfaced that Comcast and Netflix had reached an unspecified agreement,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gigaom.com/2014/02/21/comcast-netflix-peering/|title=Sources: Netflix and Comcast have reached a peering agreement|publisher=Gigaom|author=Stacey Higginbotham|date=February 21, 2014|accessdate=February 25, 2014}}</ref> the companies confirmed that Netflix was paying Comcast to connect to its network.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/cotown/la-fi-ct-netflix-comcast-20140224,0,1476262.story|title=Netflix to pay Comcast for smoother online video streaming |work=LA Times|author=Dawn C.

==Land line telephone==
'''Xfinity Voice''' (formerly '''Comcast Digital Voice''') is a landline telephone service that was launched in 2005 in select markets,<ref name="Ben Charny">{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/Comcast-pushes-VoIP-to-prime-time/2100-7352_3-5519446.html|title=Comcast pushes VoIP to prime time|publisher=Cnet|author=Ben Charny |date=January 10, 2005|accessdate=February 17, 2014}}</ref> and to all of Comcast's markets in 2006. Comcast's older service, Comcast Digital Phone, continued to offer service for a brief period, until Comcast shut it down around late 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.courant.com/2007-10-17/business/0710170375_1_comcast-digital-voice-phone-service-comcast-customer-service|title=Comcast Ends Older Phone Service|publisher=Hartford Courant|author=MARK PETERS|date=October 17, 2007|accessdate=March 8, 2014}}</ref> In 2009, after completing transition from their old service, Comcast had 7.6 million voice customers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cmcsk.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=442388|title=Comcast Reports Fourth Quarter and Year End 2009 Results|date=February 3, 2010|accessdate=March 8, 2014}}</ref> As of the end of 2013, Comcast Digital Voice had reached 10.7 million subscribers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cmcsa.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=821438|title=Comcast Reports 4th Quarter and Year End 2013 Results|publisher=Comcast|date=January 28, 2014|accessdate=March 8, 2014}}</ref>

At the start of 2012, Comcast stood as the United States' third-largest residential telephone provider.<ref name=LRG>Leichtman Research Group, [http://www.leichtmanresearch.com/research/notes04_2012.pdf "Research Notes,"] First Quarter 2012, pg. 5. The company first gained status as the USA's third largest phone company in 2009. See: [http://www.dslreports.com/shownews/Comcast-Now-Third-Largest-Phone-Company-101317 Comcast Now Third Largest Phone Company], ''DSLreports.com'', March 11, 2009.</ref> At that time the company supplied 9.34 million residential telephone lines.<ref name=LRG />

Xfinity Voice allows communication over the internet using [[VoIP]], but uses a [[private network]] instead of a [[Public IP|public IP address]], which allows Comcast to prioritize the voice data during heavy traffic. In technical terms, on Comcast's [[Hybrid Fiber Coaxial]] network, calls are placed into individual Unsolicited Grant Service flows, based on [[DOCSIS]] 1.1 [[Quality of service]] standards. For the customer, this has the benefit of preventing network congestion from interfering with call quality. However, this separation of traffic into separate flows, or [[Smart pipe]], has been seen by some as a violation of [[net neutrality]], who call instead for equal treatment of all data, or [[dumb pipe]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.multichannel.com/internet-video/smart-pipes-dumb-pipes-and-qos/129650|title=Smart Pipes, Dumb Pipes and QoS|publisher=MultiChannel|author= Leslie Ellis|date=February 17, 2006|accessdate=March 8, 2014}}</ref> Other, non-Comcast VoIP services on Comcast's network must use the lower priority public IP addresses. The practice was questioned by the FCC in 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gigaom.com/2009/01/19/fcc-asks-if-comcast-slows-rivals-voip-traffic/|title=FCC Asks if Comcast Slows Rivals' VoIP Traffic|publisher=Gigaom|author=Stacey Higginbotham|date=January 19, 2009|accessdate=March 7, 2014}}</ref> In their response, Comcast stated that services that use [[telecommunication]]s are not necessarily [[telecommunications service]]s, and noted the FCC's current designation of Comcast Digital Voice as an [[information service]] exempted it from telecommunications service regulations. Comcast also said that because Comcast Voice was a separate service, it was unfair to directly compare the data for Comcast Voice with the data for other VoIP services.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://downloads.comcast.net/docs/january-30-2009-comcast-fcc-response.pdf |title=In the Matter of Formal Complaint of Free Press and Public Knowledge Against Comcast Corporation for Secretly Degrading Peer-to-Peer Applications, File No. EB-08-IH-1518|publisher=Comcast|author=Kathryn A.

Because telephone services over VoIP are not automatically tied to a physical address, Xfinity Voice utilizes [[E911]] to help [[9-1-1|911]] service operators to automatically locate the source of the 911 call.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/comcast-launches-comcast-digital-voicer-phone-service-in-santa-barbara-county-61850297.html|title=Comcast Launches Comcast Digital Voice(R) Phone Service in Santa Barbara County|publisher=PR Newswire|author=Comcast Corp.|accessdate=March 11, 2014}}</ref> Voice calls are delivered as a digital stream over the Comcast network, signal is converted to analog [[plain old telephone service]] lines at the cable modem, which outputs on standard analog [[RJ-11]] jacks.

==Cable television==
Comcast's cable television customers peaked in 2007, with about 24.8 million customers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cmcsa.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=385958|title=Comcast Reports Fourth Quarter and Year End Results|publisher=Comcast|date=February 18, 2009|accessdate=February 16, 2014}}</ref> Comcast had lost customers every year since 2007, with the first quarterly gain in customers since their peak occurring in the fourth quarter of 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.philly.com/2014-01-09/business/45995075_1_time-warner-cable-tv-subscribers-comcast-corp|title=Comcast reverses trend, gains TV subscribers|publisher=The Philadelphia Inquirer|author=Bob Fernandez|date=January 9, 2014|accessdate=February 17, 2014}}</ref> As of the end of 2013, Comcast serves a total of 21.7&nbsp;million cable customers.<ref name=Q42013>{{cite web|url=http://www.cmcsa.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=821438|title=Comcast Reports 4th Quarter and Year End 2013 Results|publisher=Comcast|date=January 28, 2014|accessdate=February 17, 2014}}</ref> The average cost Comcast's Digital Basic cable subscription has increased 72% from 2003 to 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/silicon-forest/index.ssf/2012/08/comcasts_annual_rate_hike_mode.html|title=Comcast moderates its annual cable TV rate hike, but the cost of Internet access is rising faster|publisher=The Oregonian|author= Mike Rogoway|date=August 22, 2012|accessdate=February 23, 2014}}</ref>  In Q4 2015, Comcast added 89,000 new video subscribers which was their best result in 8 years.<ref>{{cite web|title=Comcast shrugs off years of cord-cutting losses, adds 89K TV customers|url=https://arstechnica.com/business/2016/02/comcast-shrugs-off-years-of-cord-cutting-losses-adds-89k-tv-customers/|website=Ars Technica|accessdate=October 8, 2016}}</ref>

In addition to the prices of subscriptions, since July 2012, Comcast charges a Regulatory Recovery Fee of varying size in order to "recover additional costs associated with governmental programs."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stopthecap.com/2012/07/10/comcasts-nationwide-rate-increase-bill-padding-regulatory-recovery-fees-have-arrived/|title=Comcast's Nationwide Rate Increase: Bill Padding "Regulatory Recovery" Fees Have Arrived|publisher=Stop The Cap|author=Phillip Dampier|date=July 10, 2012|accessdate=February 17, 2014}}</ref> Beginning in January 2014, Comcast also charges a Broadcast TV Fee to "defray the rising costs of retransmitting broadcast television signals."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.multichannel.com/cable-operators/comcast-introduce-150-broadcast-tv-fee/146867|title=Comcast to Introduce $1.50 Broadcast TV Fee |publisher=MultiChannel|author=Mike Farrell|date=November 22, 2013|accessdate=February 17, 2014}}</ref>

In May 2012, Comcast soft launched X1 (codenamed "Xcalibur"), a new hardware and software platform for its television services, in Boston. It provides more extensive support for integrated internet content, as well as apps for video streaming services, and a remote control that accepts [[Speech recognition|voice recognition]] input.

===Retransmission fees===
Beginning in the mid-2000s, television stations increasingly required cable companies like Comcast to pay retransmission fees in exchange for [[Retransmission consent|permission to broadcast]] their content.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2013/07/14/tv-retrans-fees/2512233/|title=Retransmission fee race poses questions for TV viewers|publisher=USA Today|author=Roger Yu|date=August 2, 2013|accessdate=February 18, 2014}}</ref> (Historically, TV broadcasters made money almost exclusively through advertising.) These fees have been the subject of heated negotiation between broadcasters and distributors, with a few high-profile [[Blackout (broadcasting)|blackouts]] prompting the [[U.S. Federal Communications Commission]] to publicly express serious concern in 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.adweek.com/news/advertising-branding/fcc-consider-forcing-bcasters-distributors-play-nice-125284|title=FCC to Consider Forcing B'casters, Distributors to Play Nice|publisher=AdWeek|author=Katy Bachman|date=March 3, 2011|accessdate=February 18, 2014}}</ref> Comcast has ten year agreements with [[CBS]]<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/03/business/media/03cbs.html|title=CBS and Comcast Reach a 10-Year Deal on Fees|work=New York Times|author=BRIAN STELTER|date=August 2, 2010|accessdate=February 18, 2014}}</ref> and [[Disney]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/01/04/idUS230102746820120104|title=Disney-Comcast Make 10-Year Xfinity Multi-Platform Deal (Breaking)|publisher=Reuters|date=January 4, 2012|accessdate=February 18, 2014}}</ref> as well as deals with [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2415351,00.asp|title=Fox, Comcast Re-Up Xfinity Content Deal|publisher=PC Magazine|author=Damon Poeter|date=February 12, 2013|accessdate=February 17, 2014}}</ref> and others, but the financial details of these deals are not public.

Since the rise of retransmission fees, distributors like Comcast pay substantial fees for retransmitting [[broadcast television]], which is free over the air for consumers. Comcast has instated a $1.50 Broadcast TV Fee to cover part of the cost of getting permission from stations to retransmit the free stations, itemized separately for consumers. Comcast's subsidiary, [[NBCUniversal]], was one of several broadcasters party to [[American Broadcasting Cos. v. Aereo, Inc.]], over the question of whether [[Aereo]] is a retransmitter (which would require it to pay retransmission fees).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.philly.com/2014-01-06/business/45885511_1_retransmission-fees-tv-stations-similar-fees|title=Fight continues over cable retransmission fees|publisher=The Philadelphia Inquirer|author=Bob Fernandez|date=January 6, 2014|accessdate=February 18, 2014}}</ref>  The case was decided on June 25, 2014 in favor of the broadcasters in a 6-3 decision.<ref>''American Broadcasting Companies v.

==Home security and automation==
Comcast offers a home security and [[home automation]] service known as Xfinity Home, in some of its service areas. This service provides residential customers a monitored burglar and fire alarm, surveillance cameras, and home automation.  Critics of their technology found that "thieves can easily undermine the system to trick homeowners into thinking theyâ€™re protected when theyâ€™re not."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2016/01/06/hacking_comcast_xfinity_s_home_security_system_is_way_too_easy.html |work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] |title=Comcast Xfinity Home Security System Leaves Home-Owners Unsecured |first=Kim |last=Zetter |date=January 6, 2016 |accessdate=August 4, 2017}}</ref> Wired magazine reported the vulnerability has the potential to attract thieves, quoting security expert Tod Beardsley: "The sign that is designed to deter attackers can now become a sign that invites attackers.<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://www.wired.com/2016/01/xfinitys-security-system-flaws-open-homes-to-thieves/|accessdate=August 4, 2017 |first=Kim |last=Zetter |date=January 5, 2016 |title=Xfinity's Security System Flaws Open Homes to Thieves |journal=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]}}</ref>

In April 2017, Comcast launched '''Xfinity Mobile''', a [[mobile virtual network operator]] ([[MVNO]]) on the [[Verizon Wireless]] network. It is promoted as being part of a [[quadruple play]] with Xfinity television, internet, and home phone services.<ref name="fw-xfinitymobile">{{Cite web|url=https://www.fiercewireless.com/wireless/comcast-xfinity-mobile-a-no-frills-mvno-service-primarily-designed-to-prevent-churn|title=Editor's Cornerâ€”Comcast Xfinity Mobile is a no-frills MVNO service primarily designed to prevent churn|website=FierceWireless|language=en|access-date=2020-01-06}}</ref>

Xfinity Mobile provides [[Prepaid mobile phone|prepaid]] (with users able to purchase data in 1&nbsp;GB bundles) and monthly unlimited plans, with the latter throttled after 20&nbsp;GB of use. The service is sold exclusively to Comcast internet and television subscribers, with discounted pricing offered to Xfinity "Premier Double Play" and "Triple Play" subscribers. Access to Xfinity WiFi hotspots is also included, which is promoted as a means to help conserve bandwidth caps.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2017/04/06/comcast-wants-be-your-new-cellphone-carrier-heres-everything-you-need-to-know/ | title=Comcast wants to be your new cellphone carrier.

Comcast Business services used to be sold exclusively through direct sales employees. In March 2011, Comcast created an [[Sales outsourcing|indirect sales channel]] called the Solution Provider Program, a comprehensive indirect channel program that enables telecommunications consultants and [[system integrator]]s to sell Comcast's services such as Business Class Internet, Voice, and high-capacity [[Fiber-optic communication|Ethernet]] services to small and mid-market businesses. The program offers recurring commissions for sales partners based on monthly revenue, and Comcast will provide, install, manage and bill for these services. For the initial launch of the Solutions Provider Program, Comcast enlisted three national master representativesâ€”[[Telarus]], based in [[Salt Lake City, Utah]]; Intelisys, based in [[Petaluma, California]]; and Telecom Brokerage Inc (TBI), based in [[Chicago]]. Sub-agent sales partners must work with one of these three partners in the early stages of the program.<ref>{{cite news|last=Henderson|first=Khali|title=Comcast Launches Agent Program |url=http://www.channelpartnersonline.com/news/2011/03/comcast-launches-agent-program.aspx|accessdate=March 14, 2011|newspaper=Channel Partners|date=March 14, 2011}}</ref>
