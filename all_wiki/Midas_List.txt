== Criticism ==
The list has been criticised by [[Fortune (magazine)|''Fortune'' magazine]] for a number of reasons: its inclusion of people involved with new start-ups that may not have made any money yet; its focus on first-day market capitalisation rather than longer-term measures; and the fact that it relies partly on the subjective judgment of a panel of experts.<ref name=fortune/>
