==History==
Augusta National was founded in 1932 by Bobby Jones and Clifford Roberts on the 365-acre site of a former nursery called Fruitland (later Fruitlands). Jones sought to create a world-class winter golf course in his native state of Georgia. During the first decade of the club's existence, membership was low and finances were short due to the [[Great Depression]] and the relatively remote location of Augusta, forcing the duo to scrap future plans for a "ladies' course," squash and tennis courts, and various estates.<ref name="new-yorker-june-19"/>

Its first club professional was [[Ed Dudley]], who served in the role until 1957; Dudley was one of the top tournament professionals of his era, with 15 wins on the [[PGA Tour]].

The Masters were first held in 1934 in an attempt to attract crowds and players. Roberts persuaded Jones, then retired, to return to play in the tournament. (Jones initially was against the name ''Masters''.)<ref name="new-yorker-june-19"/>

In 1948, Dwight D. Eisenhower and his wife Mamie were personally invited to Augusta by Roberts. Eisenhower took a liking to the club, becoming a member, and hired Roberts as his executor and financial advisor, who had a house constructed for Eisenhower on the grounds. During his presidency, Eisenhower visited Augusta National 29 times.<ref name="new-yorker-june-19"/>

==Facilities and grounds==

[[File:AugustaNationalMastersLogoFlowers.jpg|thumb|left|The clubhouse and [[Masters Tournament|The Masters]] logo in flowers]]

Augusta is renowned for its well-maintained impeccable appearance: pine straw is imported, bird sounds are played on inconspicuous speakers, and even the ponds were once dyed blue.<ref name="new-yorker-june-19"/> The club is famed for its [[azalea]]s and [[dogwood]]s.<ref name="tolve-2007"/>

Rules and policies imposed on employees, club members, and visitors (referred to internally as "patrons") are notoriously strict. No cell phones or other electronic devices are permitted (except in the press building—spot checks are performed elsewhere); no running or loud talking is allowed; and spectators are not allowed to cheer when a player makes a mistake.<ref name="new-yorker-june-19"/> Security guards enforce these rules, and are traditionally provided by [[Pinkerton (detective agency)|Pinkerton]].<ref name="new-yorker-june-19"/> Rule-breakers are permanently banned, if not prosecuted when possible.<ref name="tolve-2007"/>

Other notable facilities include Butler Cabin, near hole 18, where tournament winners are presented with a green jacket; the clubhouse, near hole 1, which dates to the 1850s and has a well-stocked wine cellar; and a practice range.<ref name="new-yorker-june-19"/> Three large cabins on the property are reserved for tournament sponsors—as of 2020, [[Mercedes-Benz]], [[IBM]], and [[AT&T]].

The club's on-site press building has television studios, a complimentary restaurant and snack options, staffed bathrooms, and leather chairs.<ref name="new-yorker-june-19"/> Cameras placed throughout the course are directly connected to the press building's studios via underground cables.<ref name="tolve-2007"/>

===Course===
The course was formerly a [[plant nursery]],<ref>{{cite journal |last=Meyers |first=Christopher C. |title=Fruitland Nursery: A 'Horticultural Mecca' |journal=Georgia Historical Quarterly |date=2015 |volume=99 |issue=1 |page=48 |url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=a9h&AN=110131811&site=eds-live&scope=site |accessdate=February 14, 2018}}</ref> and each hole on the course is named after the tree or shrub with which it has become associated.

Unlike most other private or public golf courses in the US, Augusta National has never been [[Golf handicap#Course rating and slope|rated]].  During the [[1990 Masters Tournament]], a team of [[United States Golf Association|USGA]] raters, organized by ''[[Golf Digest]]'', evaluated the course and gave it an unofficial rating of 76.2. It was re-evaluated in 2009 and given an unofficial rating of 78.1.<ref name=rating>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.golfdigest.com/golf-tours-news/golf-masters/2010-04/how-tough-augusta-knuth |title=How Tough Is Augusta National? |magazine=[[Golf Digest]] |first=Dean |last=Knuth |date=April 2010 |access-date=April 9, 2013}}</ref>

The course's greens are meticulously maintained to provide a fast and hard golfing surface.<ref name="new-yorker-june-19"/> This firmness is assisted by an underground irrigation and ventilation system known as the SubAir System, developed and installed in 1994<ref name="matuszewski-2019"/> by course superintendent Marsh Benson.<ref name="new-yorker-june-19"/> SubAir soon evolved into its own company in nearby [[Graniteville, South Carolina]], designing and installing similar automatic water suction systems in venues such as [[Pebble Beach Golf Links|Pebble Beach]], [[East Lake Golf Club|East Lake]], [[Citi Field]], and [[Citizens Bank Park]].<ref name="tolve-2007"/><ref name="matuszewski-2019">{{cite magazine |last1=Matuszewski |first1=Erik |title=SubAir Technology Found At Augusta National Is Spreading Beyond Golf |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/erikmatuszewski/2019/04/10/subair-technology-found-at-augusta-national-is-spreading-beyond-golf/#78ba5fd969c6 |magazine=Forbes |accessdate=18 June 2019 |date=April 10, 2019}}</ref>

The [[Hazard (golf)#Bunker|bunker]]s are filled not with traditional sand but with granulated [[quartz]] (known as "Spruce Pine sand" and SP55<ref name="la-times-farmer-2020"/>) which is produced as a byproduct during work at [[feldspar]] mines in the [[Spruce Pine Mining District]] in and around [[Spruce Pine, North Carolina]].<ref name="new-yorker-june-19"/> Augusta has been using Spruce Pine sand to fill its forty-four bunkers since the early 1970s, when Clifford Roberts visited Linville Golf Club in [[Linville, North Carolina]], which used the material at the time. Since the mining company providing the sand refused payment, in exchange Roberts offered to host the company owner at Augusta at any time, and later gifted him six Masters passes.<ref name="la-times-farmer-2020">{{cite news |last=Farmer |first=Sam |title=The special ingredient of those brilliant white sand traps at the Masters |url=https://www.latimes.com/sports/story/2020-11-11/sand-traps-augusta-national-masters-tiger-woods-jim-nantz |newspaper=The Los Angeles Times |accessdate=15 November 2020 |date=11 November 2020}}</ref>

The golf course architecture website GolfClubAtlas.com has said, "Augusta National has gone through more changes since its inception than any of the world's twenty or so greatest courses. To call it a MacKenzie course is false advertising as his features are essentially long gone and his routing is all that is left." The authors of the site also add that MacKenzie and Jones were heavily influenced by the [[Old Course at St Andrews]], and intended that the ground game be central to the course. Almost from Augusta's opening, Roberts sought to make changes to minimize the ground game, and effectively got free rein to do so because MacKenzie died shortly after the course's opening and Jones went into inactivity due to World War II and then [[Syringomyelia|a crippling illness]]. The authors add that "[w]ith the ground game gone, the course was especially vulnerable to changes in technology, and this brought on a slew of changes from at least 15 different 'architects'."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://golfclubatlas.com/courses-by-country/usa/augusta-national-ga-usa |title=Augusta National |work=GolfClubAtlas.com |access-date=August 11, 2010}}</ref> Golf Course Histories has an aerial comparison of the architectural changes for Augusta National Golf Club for the year 1938 versus 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://golfcoursehistories.com/ANGC.html|title=Golf Course Histories: Augusta National Golf Club|author=|date=|website=GolfCourseHistories.com|access-date=May 17, 2017}}</ref>

Among the changes to the course were several made by architect [[Perry Maxwell]] in 1937, including an important alteration involving the current 10th hole. When Augusta National originally opened for play in January 1933, the opening hole (now the 10th) was a relatively benign par 4 that played just in excess of 400 yards. From an elevated tee, the hole required little more than a short iron or wedge for the approach. Maxwell moved the green in 1937 to its present location – on top of the hill, about 50 yards back from the old site – and transformed it into the toughest hole in Masters Tournament history. [[Ben Crenshaw]] referred to Maxwell's work on the 10th hole as "one of the great strokes in golf architecture".<ref name="Augusta">{{cite web |url=http://www.augusta.com/stories/2010/04/05/mas_572492.shtml |last=Boyette |first=John |title=Maxwell made No. 10 a monster |publisher=www.Augusta.com |access-date=March 15, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923181608/http://www.augusta.com/stories/2010/04/05/mas_572492.shtml |archive-date=September 23, 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

For the 1999 tournament, a short rough was instated around the fairways. Referred to as the ''second cut'',<ref name="new-yorker-june-19"/> it is substantially shorter than the comparable primary rough at other courses, with an average length of {{convert|1.625|in|cm}}. It is meant to reduce a player's ability to control the ball coming out of this lie, and encourage better accuracy for driving onto the fairway.<ref name="lat-secondcut">{{cite news |title=Augusta National Gets a Little Rough Around the Edges |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1999/mar/12/sports/sp-16552 |date=March 12, 1998 |work=Los Angeles Times |access-date=April 11, 2016}}</ref><ref name="wsj-secondcut">{{cite news |last=Newfort |first=John Paul |title=The 'Second Cut' at the Masters Still Draws Controversy, 10 Years On |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB120795106573908835 |access-date=April 11, 2016 |work=The Wall Street Journal |date=April 12, 2008}}</ref>

====Amen Corner====
The second shot at the 11th, all of the 12th, and the first two shots at the 13th hole at Augusta are nicknamed "Amen Corner". This term was first used in print by author [[Herbert Warren Wind]]<ref name="new-yorker-june-19"/> in his April 21, 1958, ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' article about the Masters that year.<ref name="siap58">{{cite magazine |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1002131/index.htm |magazine=Sports Illustrated |last=Wind |first=Herbert Warren |authorlink=Herbert Warren Wind |title=The fateful corner |date=April 21, 1958 |page=48 |access-date=December 3, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131213065150/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1002131/index.htm |archive-date=December 13, 2013}}</ref> In a ''Golf Digest'' article in April 1984, 26 years later, Wind told about its origin. He said he wanted a catchy phrase like baseball's "[[Third baseman|hot-corner]]" or American football's "[[Coffin corner punt|coffin-corner]]" to explain where some of the most exciting golf had taken place (the [[1958 Masters Tournament|Palmer-Venturi rules issue at twelve]], over an embedded ball ruling and how it was handled,<ref>{{cite news |title=50 years later, Palmer's first Masters win still remains controversial |url=http://www.espn.com/golf/masters08/columns/story?columnist=harig_bob&id=3321633 |work=[[ESPN]] |date=April 5, 2008 |last=Harig |first=Bob}}</ref> in particular). Thus "Amen Corner" was born. He said it came from the title of a jazz record he had heard in the mid-1930s by a group led by [[Chicago]]'s [[Mezz Mezzrow]], ''Shouting in that Amen Corner''.<ref>''The Making of the Masters'', by [[David Owen]], 1999</ref> In a ''Golf Digest'' article in April 2008, writer Bill Fields offered new updated information about the origin of the name. He wrote that Richard Moore, a golf and jazz historian from [[South Carolina]], tried to purchase a copy of the old Mezzrow 78 RPM disc for an "Amen Corner" exhibit he was putting together for his Golf Museum at [[Ahmic Lake, Ontario]]. After extensive research, Moore found that the record never existed. As Moore put it, Wind, himself a jazz buff, must have "unfortunately bogeyed his mind, 26 years later". While at Yale, he was no doubt familiar with, and meant all along, the popular version of the song (with the correct title, "Shoutin' in that Amen Corner" written by Andy Razaf), which was recorded by the [[Dorsey Brothers Orchestra]], vocal by Mildred Bailey (Brunswick label No. 6655) in 1935. Moore told Fields that, being a great admirer of Wind's work over the years, he was reluctant, for months, to come forth with his discovery that contradicted Wind's memory. Moore's discovery was first reported in ''[[Golf World]]'' magazine in 2007, before Fields' longer article in ''Golf Digest'' in 2008.

In 1958 [[Arnold Palmer]] outlasted [[Ken Venturi]] to win the tournament with heroic escapes at Amen Corner. Amen Corner also played host to Masters moments such as [[Byron Nelson]]'s birdie-eagle at 12 and 13 in 1937, and [[Sam Snead]]'s water save at 12 in 1949 that sparked him to victory.  On the flip side of fate, Jordan Spieth's quadruple bogey on 12 during Sunday's final round in 2016 cost him his 2-stroke lead and ultimately the championship.

Also known as the "Eisenhower Pine," a [[loblolly pine]] was located on the 17th hole, about 210 yards (192&nbsp;m) from the Masters tee. [[President of the United States|President]] [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], an Augusta National member, hit the tree so many times that, at a 1956 club meeting, he proposed that it be cut down.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://golf.about.com/od/majorchampionships/f/eisenhower-tree.htm |title=Eisenhower Tree: Where is it, and how did it get its name? |work=Golf.About.com}}</ref> Not wanting to offend the president, the club's chairman, [[Clifford Roberts]], immediately adjourned the meeting rather than reject the request. In February 2014, the Eisenhower Tree was removed after suffering extensive damage during an ice storm.<ref>{{cite news  |url=http://chronicle.augusta.com/sports/golf/2014-02-16/masters-landmark-ikes-tree-suffers-major-damage-removed?v=1392572685 |title=Masters landmark Ike's Tree suffers major damage, removed |first=John |last=Boyette |newspaper=The Augusta Chronicle |date=February 16, 2014}}</ref>

====Ike's Pond====
During a visit to Augusta National, then-General Eisenhower returned from a walk through the woods on the eastern part of the grounds, and informed Clifford Roberts that he had found a perfect place to build a dam if the club would like a [[fish pond]]. Ike's Pond was built for Eisenhower to fish in and named after him; the dam is located just where Eisenhower said it should be.<ref>{{cite news |last=Pavey |first=Rob |url=http://chronicle.augusta.com/stories/2009/04/12/pav_520049.shtml |title=In 60 years, little about Ike's Pond has changed |newspaper=The Augusta Chronicle |date=April 12, 2009 |accessdate=April 6, 2012}}</ref>

====Rae's Creek====
Rae's Creek cuts across the southeastern corner of the Augusta National property.  It flows along the back of the 11th green, in front of the 12th green, and ahead of the 13th tee.  This is the lowest point in elevation of the course.  The Hogan and Nelson Bridges cross the creek after the 12th and 13th tee boxes, respectively.  The [[stream|creek]] was named after former property owner John Rae, who died in 1789.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.masters.com/en_US/course/landmarks.html#Rae |title=The Course – Landmarks |accessdate=April 16, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090414012709/http://www.masters.com/en_US/course/landmarks.html |archivedate=April 14, 2009 }}</ref>

Rae's Creek runs in front of No. 12 green, has a tributary evident at No. 13 tee, and flows at the back of No. 11 green. It was Rae's house which was the farthest fortress up the Savannah River from Fort Augusta. The house kept residents safe during Indian attacks when the fort was out of reach.

===Real estate===
Over the decades, Augusta National has bought and redeveloped nearby land. From 1999 to 2019, the club spent about $200&nbsp;million to buy 100 separate properties totaling over 270 acres, some more than a mile distant from the club proper.<ref name="costa-wsj-2019">{{cite news |last1=Costa |first1=Brian |title=Augusta National Has Quietly Made a $200 Million Land Grab |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/augusta-nationals-makes-a-200-million-land-grab-11554897600 |newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |accessdate=18 June 2019 |date=April 10, 2019}}</ref> Most purchases are arranged via LLCs connected to Augusta National in order to obfuscate the transaction's details.<ref name="aug-chron">{{cite news |last1=Cline |first1=Damon |title=Scuttlebiz: Augusta National's land grab continues |url=https://www.augustachronicle.com/news/20190119/scuttlebiz-augusta-nationals-land-grab-continues |newspaper=[[The Augusta Chronicle]] |accessdate=18 June 2019 |date=January 19, 2019}}</ref> More than a dozen of these LLCs are known to exist, and up to five may be involved in a single purchase.<ref name="aug-chron"/> Augusta National ultimately purchases each LLC, acquiring its land holdings and keeping the real estate price away from public records.<ref name="costa-wsj-2019"/> Non-disclosure agreements are also commonly employed.<ref name="costa-wsj-2019"/>

==Membership==
Augusta National Golf Club has about 300 members at any given time. Membership is strictly by invitation: there is no application process.

===2002 membership controversy===
Augusta National and its then-Chairman Hootie Johnson are widely known for their disagreement, beginning in 2002, with [[Martha Burk]], then chair of the Washington-based [[National Council of Women's Organizations]]; the dispute arose over Augusta National's refusal to admit female members to the club.<ref name="nyt2003">{{cite news |title=Sports of The Times; Hootie Is Handling the Heat on the Eve of the Masters |newspaper=The New York Times |first=Dave |last=Anderson |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/10/sports/sports-of-the-times-hootie-is-handling-the-heat-on-the-eve-of-the-masters.html |date=April 10, 2003 |accessdate=April 25, 2010}}</ref> Burk said she found out about the club's policies in a ''USA Today'' column by Christine Brennan published April 11, 2002.

==Green jacket==
Every member of Augusta National receives a green [[sport coat]] with the club's logo on the left breast. Members are required to wear them during the tournament, and the jackets are not allowed to be removed from the grounds.<ref name="new-yorker-june-19"/> The idea of the green jacket originated with club co-founder Clifford Roberts. Many believe it is because he wanted patrons visiting during the tournament to be able to readily identify members. Since Sam Snead's victory in 1949, the winner of each year's Masters Tournament has received a green jacket, although he does not receive membership.  The jacket is presented to the new winner by the winner of the previous tournament. If the previous champion is either unavailable or has won consecutive tournaments, then the current chairman acts as the presenter. Until 1967, the jackets were manufactured by [[Brooks Brothers]] and since have been made by Hamilton of [[Cincinnati, Ohio]], with the imported wool produced at the Victor Forstmann plant in [[Dublin, Georgia]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.augusta.com/masters/history/ohio-firm-fashions-green-jackets-from-georgia-cloth |title=Ohio firm fashions green jackets from Georgia cloth |date=February 16, 2012 |accessdate=June 30, 2012}}</ref>

The current Masters champion is the only owner of a green jacket permitted to remove it from the grounds of Augusta National, and only for a period of one year.  Before this time limit was in place, the jacket of a few long-past Masters champions had been sold, after their deaths, to collectors.  Consequently, the members of Augusta National have gone to great lengths to secure the remaining examples. Now, two jackets remain outside the grounds of Augusta National with the club's permission.  When [[Gary Player]] first won the Masters in 1961, he brought his jacket home to [[South Africa]]. For years the board insisted that Player return the jacket but Player kept "forgetting" or coming up with humorous creative excuses why he did not return the jacket. After becoming something of a running joke,  Augusta National's members allowed him to keep it, where it is on display in his personal museum. The second jacket belongs to [[1938 Masters Tournament|1938]] champion [[Henry Picard]]. Before the traditions were well established, the jacket was removed by Picard from Augusta National. It is now currently on display in the "Picard Lounge" at [[Canterbury Golf Club]] in [[Beachwood, Ohio]].
