He began attending [[Bowdoin College]] in [[Brunswick, Maine]] in 1949 with plans to join the ministry<ref>{{Cite web | title=Ambassador Tom Pickering Lecture Introduction | website = Bowdoin College (Office of the President) | url=http://www.bowdoin.edu/president/speeches/2008/pickering-introduction.shtml | access-date=2009-09-21 | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110603234747/http://www.bowdoin.edu/president/speeches/2008/pickering-introduction.shtml | archive-date=2011-06-03 }}</ref> and graduated cum laude in 1953 with high honors in history and is a member of [[Theta Delta Chi]] and [[Phi Beta Kappa Society|Phi Beta Kappa]].

==Diplomatic career==
His four-decade-long career in [[United States Foreign Service|Foreign Service]] included ambassadorships in [[United States Ambassador to Russia|Russia]] (1993–1996); [[United States Ambassador to India|India]] (1992–1993); to the [[United States Ambassadors to the United Nations|United Nations]] (1989–1992); [[United States Ambassador to Israel|Israel]] (1985–1988); [[United States Ambassador to El Salvador|El Salvador]] (1983–1985); [[United States Ambassador to Nigeria|Nigeria]] (1981–1983); and [[United States Ambassador to Jordan|Jordan]] (1974–1978). Additionally, he served as [[Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs]] from 1997 to 2000.  He holds the rank of [[Diplomatic rank#United States Foreign Service|Career Ambassador]], the highest in the U.S. Foreign Service.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cfr.org/bios/299/thomas_r_pickering.html | title = Thomas R.

===Early career===
Early in his career, he was assigned to the U.S. embassy in [[Tanzania]] and later was Special Assistant to Secretaries of State [[William P. Rogers]] and [[Henry Kissinger]]. When Pickering served as [[United States Ambassador to Jordan]] in the mid-1970s, [[King Hussein]] declared him "the best American ambassador I've dealt with."<ref name="representative1">{{Cite news |title=Bush's Selections for the United Nations, the C.I.A. and Top Economic Posts; Thomas Reeve Pickering, U.S. Representative to the United Nations |newspaper = [[The New York Times]] |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE6D61E3EF934A35751C1A96E948260 |access-date=2009-02-19 |first=Charles |last=Mohr |date=1988-12-07}}</ref> From 1978 to 1981, he served as Assistant Secretary of State for Oceans and International Environmental and Scientific Affairs. He then spent time as the [[United States Ambassador to Nigeria]] before President [[Ronald Reagan]] surprisingly replaced the Ambassador to [[El Salvador]], [[Deane R. Hinton]], and put Pickering in his place.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Disappearing Act at Foggy Botton |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,955164-2,00.html|access-date=2009-02-20 |date=1983-08-08 |first1=Walter |last1=Isaacson |first2=Gregory H. |last2=Wierzynski}}</ref>

Pickering's time as [[United States Ambassador to El Salvador]] was particularly eventful. Only a year after having been appointed ambassador in 1984, Pickering was the subject of assassination threats from right-wing Salvadoran politicians.<ref name="representative1" /> The same year, Republican Senator [[Jesse Helms]] of [[North Carolina]] urged that Pickering be dismissed, arguing that he helped manipulate the country's elections.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Taking Sides? |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,955266-1,00.html |access-date=2009-02-19 |date=1984-05-14}}</ref> In both cases, President [[Ronald Reagan]] offered Pickering his full support and he secured him a job as [[United States Ambassador to Israel]] after his appointment in El Salvador. It was later noted when Pickering was nominated as U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations that he played a minor role in the [[Iran–Contra affair]] while Ambassador to El Salvador.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Bush's Choice for U.N. Carried Contra Appeal |newspaper = [[The New York Times]] |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE4D91538F93BA35751C1A96E948260&n=Top/Reference/Times%20Topics/People/P/Pickering,%20Thomas%20R.&scp=10&sq=Thomas%20Pickering&st=cse|access-date=2009-02-19 |date=1988-12-08}}</ref>

As Ambassador to Israel, Pickering led the United States' criticism of an Israeli policy that expelled Palestinians accused of instilling uprising.<ref>{{Cite news |title=U.S. Criticism Sets Off Furor In Israel |newspaper = [[The New York Times]] |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE1D7103EF936A1575BC0A96E948260&n=Top/Reference/Times%20Topics/People/P/Pickering,%20Thomas%20R.&scp=5&sq=Thomas%20Pickering%20Israel&st=cse |access-date=2009-02-19 |first=Joel |last=Brinkley |date=1988-08-25}}</ref> Pickering stressed to Israeli Prime Minister [[Yitzhak Shamir]] that the United States considered the actions illegal and unhelpful for peace efforts.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Middle East Trials and Errors |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,966430-3,00.html |access-date=2009-02-20 |date=1988-01-11}}</ref>

===United Nations and subsequent career===
President [[George H.W. Bush]]'s appointment of Pickering as [[United States Ambassador to the United Nations]] was approved almost unanimously in the [[United States Senate]] in 1989 with no dissentions and only one abstention.<ref>{{Cite news | title=Senate Backs U.N. Delegate | newspaper = [[The New York Times]] | url= https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DEEDE1539F93BA35750C0A96F948260&scp=5&sq=Thomas%20Pickering%20United%20Nations&st=cse| access-date=2009-02-19 | date=1989-03-08}}</ref>  Pickering played a critical role as Ambassador during the [[First Gulf War]], when he helped lead the [[United Nations Security Council]]'s response to [[Iraq]]'s invasion of [[Kuwait]].<ref>{{Cite news | title=MIDEAST TENSIONS; U.S. Envoy to U.N. on Center Stage | newspaper = [[The New York Times]] | url= https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE5DC1638F933A25752C1A966958260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=2| access-date=2009-02-19 | first=Paul | last=Lewis | date=1990-11-10}}</ref>  Bush's decision to move Pickering from the [[United Nations]] to become the [[United States Ambassador to India]] was highly criticized given Pickering's successful tenure.  The ''[[New York Times]]'' declared that Pickering was "arguably the best-ever U.S. representative to that body" <ref>{{Cite news | title=Foreign Affairs; End U.S. Dipbaloney | newspaper = [[New York Times]] | url= https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE5D8153BF930A35751C0A964958260&n=Top/Reference/Times%20Topics/People/P/Pickering,%20Thomas%20R.&scp=1&sq=Thomas%20Pickering%20United%20Nations%20India&st=cse| access-date=2009-02-19 | first=Leslie H. | last=Gelb | date=1992-02-03}}</ref> and that the move was made simply because he overshadowed Secretary of State [[James Baker|James A. Baker]] during the [[Gulf war|Persian Gulf Crisis]].<ref>{{Cite news | title=Jan 24-30: A Quick Study; A Diplomat's Diplomat Goes to Russia | url= https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE5D8153BF930A35751C0A964958260&n=Top/Reference/Times%20Topics/People/P/Pickering,%20Thomas%20R.&scp=1&sq=Thomas%20Pickering%20United%20Nations%20India&st=cse| access-date=2009-02-19 | newspaper = [[The New York Times]] | first=Leslie H. | last=Gelb | date=1992-02-03}}</ref>  Pickering's last ambassadorial appointment was made by President [[Bill Clinton]] who designated him [[United States Ambassador to Russia]].

Following the resignation of Secretary of State [[Warren Christopher]] in 1996, Pickering was reportedly a top contender for the post, but was ultimately passed over in favor of then-UN Ambassador [[Madeleine Albright]].<ref>[http://www.usembassy-israel.org.il/publish/press/usia/archive/november/us21121.htm] {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>

From 1997 to 2001, Pickering served as [[Under Secretary for Political Affairs|Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs]], the number-three position at the [[United States Department of State|State Department]]. When Albright appointed him to the post, [[Time (magazine)|Time magazine]] declared him the "[[five star general]] of the diplomatic corps".<ref>{{Cite magazine | title=The Many Lives of Madeleine| magazine = [[Time (magazine)|Time]] | url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,985910-5,00.html| access-date=2009-02-20 | date=1997-02-17}}</ref> In 1998, he was a special envoy to Nigeria and was meeting with imprisoned leader [[M. K. O. Abiola]] on the day of his release. In a BBC interview made at the time, Pickering recounted how during the meeting Abiola became ill, and died soon after.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/128491.stm | title= Abiola's death - an eyewitness account | date=July 7, 1998 | work = [[BBC News]] | access-date=May 11, 2012 | last = Turner | first = Martin | location=Abuja}}</ref>
