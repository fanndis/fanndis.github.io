"'''I Will Always Love You'''" is a song written and originally recorded in 1973 by American singer-songwriter [[Dolly Parton]].<ref name="songfacts.com">{{Cite web|url=http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=4941|title=I Will Always Love You by Dolly Parton Songfacts|website=www.songfacts.com|access-date=November 12, 2016}}</ref> Her [[Country music|country]] version of the track was released in 1974 as a single and was written as a farewell to her former partner and mentor of seven years, [[Porter Wagoner]], following Parton's decision to leave ''The Porter Wagoner Show'' and pursue a solo career.<ref name="songfacts.com"/><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.tennessean.com/story/entertainment/music/2015/12/26/dolly-parton-remembers-writing-always-love-you/77762172/|title=Dolly Parton remembers writing 'I Will Always Love You'|newspaper=The Tennessean|access-date=November 12, 2016}}</ref>

Parton's version of "I Will Always Love You" was a commercial success. It reached number one on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] chart twice. It first reached number one in June 1974, and then in October 1982, with her re-recording on the soundtrack of the movie version of ''[[The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas (film)|The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas]].''  Thus, she achieved a number one position twice with the same song, a rare feat that [[Chubby Checker]] had done previously with "The Twist" becoming number one in 1960 and again in 1962.

[[Whitney Houston]] recorded her version of the song for the 1992 film ''[[The Bodyguard (1992 film)|The Bodyguard]]''.

[[Country music]] singer-songwriter [[Dolly Parton]] wrote the song in 1973 for her one-time partner and mentor [[Porter Wagoner]], from whom she was separating professionally after a seven-year partnership.<ref>{{harvnb|Oldes|2007|p=145}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Cramer|2009|p=1084}}</ref> She recorded it in [[RCA Studio B]] in Nashville on June 12, 1973.<ref name=vinyl/> "I Will Always Love You" was issued on March 18, 1974, as the second single from Parton's thirteenth solo studio album, ''[[Jolene (album)|Jolene]]'' (1974). In 1982, Parton re-recorded the song, when it was included on the soundtrack to the film ''[[The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas (film)|The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/#/album/original-soundtrack/the-best-little-whorehouse-in-texas-original/64790|title=The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|access-date=June 16, 2011}}</ref> In addition to the 1982 re-recording for the soundtrack album, Parton's original 1974 recording of the song also appeared in [[Martin Scorsese]]'s film ''[[Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore]]'', and the 1996 film ''[[It's My Party (film)|It's My Party]].'' The song also won Parton Female Vocalist of the Year at the 1975 [[CMA Awards]].

Author Curtis W. Ellison stated that the song "speaks about the breakup of a relationship between a man and a woman that does not descend into unremitting domestic turmoil, but instead envisions parting with respect – because of the initiative of the woman".<ref name=el1>{{harvnb|Ellison|1995|p=195}}</ref> According to sheet music published at musicnotes.com by [[Hal Leonard Corporation]], the [[country (genre)|country]] [[ballad (music)|love]] track is set in a [[time signature]] of [[common time]] with a [[tempo]] of 66 [[beats per minute]].

Several times (long before Whitney Houston recorded the song), Dolly Parton suggested to singer [[Patti Labelle]] that she record "I Will Always Love You" because she felt Patti could have sung it so well. However, Patti admitted she kept putting off the opportunity to do so and later deeply regretted it after she heard Whitney Houston's rendition.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.iloveoldschoolmusic.com/patti-says-she-regrets-turning-down-these-2-major-hits-missing-millions/2/|title=Patti Says She Regrets Turning Down These 2 Major Hits, Missing Millions|date=July 1, 2015|website=I Love Old School Music|language=en-US|access-date=October 10, 2019}}</ref>

==Releases and reception==
During its original release in 1974, "I Will Always Love You" reached number four in Canada on the Canadian ''RPM'' Country Tracks chart and peaked at number one on the ''Billboard'' [[Hot Country Songs]] chart, becoming one of the best selling singles of 1974.<ref>{{harvnb|Dean|2003|p=477}}</ref>

When Parton re-recorded the song in 1982 for the soundtrack of the film ''The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas'', the track was issued as a single and once again charted at number one on Hot Country Songs – making her the first artist ever to earn a number one record twice with the same song.<ref name=el1/> The 1982 version also reached number 53 on Billboard's Hot 100 and number 17 on its adult contemporary charts. Parton's recording has sold 489,000 digital copies since becoming available for download.<ref>{{cite web |last=Bjorke |first=Matt |title=Top 30 Digital Country Songs: December 2, 2019 |url=http://roughstock.com/news/2019/12/44056-44056 |work=Rough Stock |date=December 2, 2019 |access-date=January 4, 2020}}</ref>

Parton recorded a duet with [[Vince Gill]] in 1995 for the album ''[[Something Special (Dolly Parton album)|Something Special]]'', the duet version of "I Will Always Love You" made the ''Billboard'' country chart and peaked at number 15.  Parton and Gill were awarded the CMA's "Vocal Event of the Year" award in 1996 for their recording of the song.<ref name="Hot Country Songs"/> Another duet version of the song was released in 2017 with [[Michael Bolton]] from his album [[Songs of Cinema]].

When the 1974 recording of the song was reaching number one on the country charts, [[Elvis Presley]] indicated that he wanted to cover the song. Parton was interested until Presley's manager, [[Colonel Tom Parker]], told her that it was standard procedure for the songwriter to sign over half of the publishing rights to any song Elvis recorded.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://kool.cbslocal.com/2016/06/08/this-day-in-music-history-june-8th/ |title=This Day in Music History – June 8th |website=kool.cbslocal.com |publisher=CBS Radio |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170303215240/http://kool.cbslocal.com/2016/06/08/this-day-in-music-history-june-8th/ |archive-date=March 3, 2017 |access-date=March 3, 2017}}</ref> Parton refused. She recalls:<blockquote>I said, 'I'm really sorry,' and I cried all night. I mean, it was like the worst thing. You know, it's like, Oh, my God ... Elvis Presley.' And other people were saying, 'You're nuts. It's Elvis Presley.' ...I said, 'I can't do that. Something in my heart says, 'Don't do that. And I just didn't do it... He would have killed it. But anyway, so he didn't. Then when Whitney [Houston's version] came out, I made enough money to buy Graceland.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.wideopencountry.com/the-greatest-country-love-song-of-all-time/ |title=The Surprising Backstory of Dolly Parton's 'I Will Always Love You' |website=wideopencountry.com |publisher=WOS Inc. |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170303220521/http://www.wideopencountry.com/the-greatest-country-love-song-of-all-time/ |archive-date=March 3, 2017 |access-date=March 3, 2017}}</ref></blockquote>

==Critical reception==
In Curtis W. Ellison's book, ''Country Music Culture: From Hard Times to Heaven'' (1995), he stated: "In the early 1990s, when ambiguity in romantic relationships accompanies changing expectations for both men and women, this song demonstrates Dolly Parton's appeal as a songwriter in the pop music market."<ref name=el1/> Ken Knight, author of ''The Midnight Show: Late Night Cable-TV "Guy-Flicks" of the '80s'' (2008), commented that Parton is the only singer who can sing "I Will Always Love You" and "make it memorable".<ref>{{harvnb|Knight|2008|p=36}}</ref> Writer Paul Simpson criticized the singer, stating that the track was only written to "soften the blow" of Parton and Wagoner's split.<ref>{{harvnb|Simpson|2003|p=241}}</ref>

Parton recorded the song in 1982 for ''[[The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas (film)|The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas]]'' [[The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas (soundtrack)|soundtrack]]. It was released on July 12, 1982, as the first single from the soundtrack. It would eventually peak at number one on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs|Hot Country Singles]] chart, thus Parton reached the number one position twice with the same song, a rare feat that Chubby Checker had previously achieved when "The Twist" reached number one in 1960 and again in 1962.

===Critical reception===
''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' gave a positive review which said, "The first single from ''The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas'' isn't the sort of brassy main theme normally used to launch a major movie musical: here Parton reinterprets one of her earliest exercises in pure pop writing, and while older fans may be divided over the breathier, more stylized reading she offers here, the song itself is still a lovely ballad with a soaring chorus."<ref>{{cite web |title=Top Single Picks |url=https://www.americanradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Music/Archive-Billboard-IDX/IDX/80s/1982/BB-1982-soul-OCR-Page-0191.pdf |website=American Radio History |publisher=Billboard |access-date=December 27, 2019 |page=63 |date=July 24, 1982}}</ref>

''[[Cashbox (magazine)|Cashbox]]'' also reviewed the single favorably, saying that "hoisted over a building arrangement, Parton's vocals have never been more convincing or moving. The single choice from her Hollywood flick, ''The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas'', the tune is sentiment wrapped in an appropriate package replete with strings, oboe and harp in addition to a delicate rhythm section."<ref>{{cite web |title=Reviews |url=https://www.americanradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Music/Archive-Cash-Box-IDX/80s/1982/CB-1982-07-24-OCR-Page-0050.pdf |website=American Radio History |publisher=Cashbox |access-date=December 27, 2019 |date=July 24, 1982}}</ref>

Following an August 26 performance of the duet at the [[Grand Ole Opry]] which aired on [[The Nashville Network|TNN]], radio stations began giving the duet unsolicited airplay, causing it to debut on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs|Hot Country Singles & Tracks]] chart at number 53. After a performance at the 29th Annual [[Country Music Association Awards|CMA Awards]], the song was officially released as a single in November 1995, peaking at number 15.

The song was nominated at the [[38th Annual Grammy Awards]] for [[Grammy Award for Best Country Collaboration with Vocals|Best Country Collaboration with Vocals]] and was named Vocal Event of the Year at the 30th Annual CMA Awards.

===Background===
In 1992, American singer [[Whitney Houston]] recorded a new arrangement of "I Will Always Love You" for [[The Bodyguard (soundtrack)|the soundtrack]] to ''[[The Bodyguard (1992 film)|The Bodyguard]]'', her film debut. The song has a saxophone solo by [[Kirk Whalum]]. She was originally to record [[Jimmy Ruffin]]'s "[[What Becomes of the Brokenhearted]]" as the lead single from ''The Bodyguard''. However, when it was discovered the song was to be used for ''[[Fried Green Tomatoes (film)|Fried Green Tomatoes]]'', Houston requested a different song. It was her co-star [[Kevin Costner]] who suggested "I Will Always Love You", playing her [[Linda Ronstadt]]'s 1975 version from her album ''[[Prisoner in Disguise]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cmt.com/news/1679096/whitney-houston-how-dolly-parton-song-landed-on-the-bodyguard-soundtrack/|title=Whitney Houston: How Dolly Parton Song Landed on The Bodyguard Soundtrack|website=CMT News|access-date=June 20, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.yahoo.com/music/bp/12-things-didn-t-know-always-love-192744564.html|title=12 Things You Didn't Know About 'I Will Always Love You'|website=www.yahoo.com|access-date=June 20, 2016}}</ref> Producer David Foster and Houston re-arranged the song as a [[Soul music|soul]] ballad.<ref name="soul">{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/rockandpopfeatures/9086771/Whitney-Houston-and-Dolly-Parton-why-I-Will-Always-Love-You-is-Whitneys-ultimate-song.html|title=Whitney Houston and Dolly Parton: why 'I Will Always Love You' is Whitney's ultimate song|newspaper=[[Daily Telegraph|Telegraph]]|last=Brown|first=Helen|date=February 16, 2012|access-date=October 20, 2017}}</ref> Her record company did not feel a song with an [[a cappella]] introduction would be as successful; however, Houston and Costner insisted on retaining it. When Parton heard that Houston was using Ronstadt's recording as a template, she called Foster to give him the final verse, which was missing from the Ronstadt recording, as she felt it was important to the song.

Houston's recording is not the only version of the song featured in the film. In a scene where she dances with Costner, a version by [[John Doe (musician)|John Doe]] can be heard playing on a jukebox.

===Critical reception===
Houston's version of "I Will Always Love You" received widespread acclaim from music critics, being now regarded as her "signature song". [[Larry Flick]] of ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' wrote that the song is "bolstered by a remarkably restrained (and ultimately effective) vocal by Houston. She builds to dramatic, heartfelt conclusion that makes sense, given the unusually slow-building created by producer [[David Foster]]."<ref>{{cite magazine|first= Larry |last= Flick |title= Single Reviews |magazine= [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |date= November 7, 1992 |page= 79 |access-date= October 25, 2020 |url= https://worldradiohistory.com/Archive-Billboard/90s/1992/Billboard-1992-11-07.pdf}}</ref> Randy Clark of ''[[Cashbox (magazine)|Cashbox]]'' noted that "the unstoppable voice and unquestionable talent of Whitney Houston will no doubt come roaring back onto the charts with this cover".<ref>{{cite magazine|first= Randy |last= Clark |title= Music Reviews: Singles |magazine= [[Cashbox (magazine)|Cashbox]] |date= November 14, 1992 |page= 5 |access-date= November 1, 2020 |url= https://worldradiohistory.com/Archive-All-Music/Cash-Box/90s/1992/CB-1992-11-14.pdf}}</ref> Amy Linden of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' said it "is artistically satisfying and uncharacteristically hip for the [[Middle of the road (music)|MOR]] songbird."<ref>{{cite web | author = Amy Linden | url = https://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,312588,00.html | title = Music Review: The Bodyguard Soundtrack | work = [[Entertainment Weekly]] | date = December 4, 1992 | access-date = September 25, 2010}}</ref> John Martinucci of ''[[Gavin Report]]'' asserted that Houston "delivers a powerful rendition that reminds us of her natural abilities as a singer with or without musical accompaniment."<ref>{{cite magazine|first= John |last= Martinucci |title= Urban: New Releases |magazine= [[Gavin Report]] |date= November 6, 1992 |page= 14 |access-date= October 17, 2020 |url= https://worldradiohistory.com/Archive-All-Music/Gavin-Report/90/92/Gavin-1992-11-06.pdf}}</ref> Chris Willman of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' commented that the singer "has the goods to deliver on the tune's haunting beauty and resists overpowering it – until the finale, when the key change and stratospheric notes drain all the heart-rending sadness out of the song and make it sound like just another anthem of survival."<ref>{{cite web | url=https://articles.latimes.com/1992-11-22/entertainment/ca-1891_1_whitney-houston|author = Chris Willman | title = Record Rock: Whitney Houston and Others; "The Bodyguard" original soundtrack | work = [[Los Angeles Times]] | date = November 22, 1992 | access-date = April 1, 2014}}</ref> [[Stephen Holden]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' called it a "magnificent rendition", commenting,<blockquote>Houston transforms a plaintive country ballad into a towering pop-gospel assertion of lasting devotion to a departing lover.

===Chart performance===
The single spent 14 weeks at the top of the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], which at the time was a record.<ref name="iwalyhot100">{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=KRAEAAAAMBAJ&pg=RA1-PA88 | title = ''Billboard'' Hot 100 Singles chart listing for the week of November 28, 1992 | publisher = Billboard | date = November 28, 1992 | access-date = September 24, 2010}}</ref><ref name="bb941119">{{cite book | author = Fred Bronson | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ZggEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA94 | title = Chart Beat: Another Lucky 13 For Boyz II Men | publisher = Billboard | date = November 19, 1994 | access-date = September 25, 2010}}</ref> It became Houston's longest run atop the chart, surpassing her previous record of three weeks with "[[The Greatest Love of All#Whitney Houston version|Greatest Love of All]]" in 1986. It is also the longest running number-one single from a soundtrack album.

It debuted at number 40 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100, and became Houston's tenth number-one entry two weeks later. It also dominated other ''Billboard'' charts, spending 14 weeks at the top of ''Billboard'' [[Hot 100 Single Sales]] chart, and 11 weeks at number one on its [[Hot 100 Airplay]] chart. The song also remained at number one for five weeks on the [[Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks]], and for 11 weeks on the [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs|Hot R&B Singles chart]] becoming the longest running number one on the R&B charts at the time; it remained in the top 40 for 24 weeks.<ref name="iwalyadultcontemporary">{{cite web | url = https://www.billboard.com/charts/1992-12-19/adult-contemporary | title = ''Billboard'' Hot Adult Contemporary chart listing for the week of December 19, 1992 | work = Billboard | date = December 19, 1992 | access-date = September 24, 2010}}</ref><ref name="iwalyhotrnb">{{cite web | url = https://www.billboard.com/charts/1992-12-05/r-b-hip-hop-songs | title = ''Billboard'' Hot R&B Singles chart listing for the week of December 5, 1992 | work = Billboard | date = December 5, 1992 | access-date = September 24, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | author = Fred Bronson | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=SAgEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA126 | title = Chart Beat – Ace Is Back On Top; Aaliyah Goes 'Forth' | publisher = Billboard | date = May 7, 1994 | access-date = September 24, 2010}}</ref> It became [[Arista Records]]' biggest hit.

The song stayed at number one in the United States throughout January and February 1993, making it the first time ''Billboard'' did not rank a new number-one single until March of the new year. Houston's "I Will Always Love You" was also the year-end single of 1993 in the US.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/bbcom/charts/yearend_chart_display.jsp?f=The+Billboard+Hot+100&g=Year-end+Singles&year=1993 |title=Information Not Found |work=Billboard |access-date=September 15, 2010}}</ref> Similarly, in the UK, Houston's version was ranked the number-one single of 1992, and then made the countdown again in 1993 where it was ranked number nine, marking the first time any musical act had the same single ranked in the top ten of the year-end review two years in a row.<ref name="uksinglesyearend">{{cite web | url = http://www.everyhit.com/chart5.html | title = Chart Archive – 1990s Singles | publisher = [[The Official Charts Company]] | access-date = September 24, 2010}}</ref> In Australia, it was the number 17 single of 1992 and the number two song of 1993.<ref name="1992ariayearend">{{cite web|url=http://www.aria.com.au/pages/aria-charts-end-of-year-charts-top-50-singles-1992.htm |title=ARIA Charts – End Of Year Charts – Top 50 Singles 1992 |publisher=[[Australian Recording Industry Association]] |access-date=September 24, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100728000557/http://www.aria.com.au/pages/aria-charts-end-of-year-charts-top-50-singles-1992.htm |archive-date=July 28, 2010 }}</ref><ref name="1993ariayearend">{{cite web|url=http://www.aria.com.au/pages/aria-charts-end-of-year-charts-top-50-singles-1993.htm |title=ARIA Charts – End Of Year Charts – Top 50 Singles 1993 |publisher=[[Australian Recording Industry Association]] |access-date=September 24, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100330203821/http://www.aria.com.au/pages/aria-charts-end-of-year-charts-top-50-singles-1993.htm |archive-date=March 30, 2010 }}</ref>

Only a few hours after Houston's death on February 11, 2012, "I Will Always Love You" topped the US [[iTunes]] charts. Also, in the week following her death, the single returned to the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 after almost twenty years, debuting at number seven, and becoming a posthumous top-ten single for Houston, the first one since 2001. The song eventually peaked at number three, two spots shy of becoming the first song to return to the top position after falling off the chart since [[Chubby Checker]]'s "[[The Twist (song)|The Twist]]".<ref>{{cite web|title=Whitney Houston's "I Will Always Love You" Back in Top 10 After 20 Years; Madonna Extends Her Lead in Most Top 10s|url=http://www.vintagevinylnews.com/2012/02/whitney-houstons-i-will-always-love-you.html|work=Vintage Vinyl News|access-date=February 16, 2012|date=February 15, 2012}}</ref> It debuted on the [[Hot Digital Songs|''Billboard'' Hot Digital Singles Chart]] at number three on the chart dated February 25, 2012, with over 195,000 copies downloaded.<ref>{{cite web|last=Caulfield|first=Keith|title=Adele's '21' Hits 20th Week at No. 1, Van Halen Debuts at No. 2|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/505646/adeles-21-hits-20th-week-at-no-1-van-halen-debuts-at-no-2|work=Billboard|access-date=February 16, 2012|date=February 15, 2012}}</ref> In the United Kingdom, the song charted at number ten the week of Houston's death.<ref>{{cite news|title=Whitney Houston songs race up music charts|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/02/15/us-whitneyhouston-music-idUSTRE81E1R120120215|work=Reuters|access-date=February 16, 2012|date=February 15, 2012}}</ref>

Houston's single sold approximately 400,000 copies in its second week at the top of the charts, making it the best-selling song in a single week surpassing [[Bryan Adams]]' "[[(Everything I Do) I Do It for You]]".

===Controversy===
After Whitney Houston's recording of the song became a hit in 1992, the [[Tabloid journalism|tabloid press]] began reporting on a 'feud' between the two performers, stemming from Dolly Parton allegedly reneging on an agreement that she would not perform the song for a number of months while Houston's version was on the charts, so as not to compete with Houston's recording. However, both Parton and Houston dismissed any rumors, speaking glowingly of one another in interviews.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0307/03/lkl.00.html |title=CNN.com – Transcripts |publisher=CNN |date=July 3, 2003 |access-date=September 15, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |newspaper=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=June 10, 1993 |first1=Anthony |last1=DeCurtis |author-link=Anthony DeCurtis |first2=Albert |last2=Watson |title=Down & Dirty}} From copy posted at {{cite web|url=http://www.classicwhitney.com/interview/rollingstone_1993.htm |title=Interview: Rolling Stone 1993 |publisher=classicwhitney.com |date=June 10, 1993 |access-date=September 15, 2010}}</ref> Houston praised Parton for writing a beautiful song. In return, Parton thanked Houston for bringing her song to a wider audience and increasing the amount of [[royalties]] for the song in the process. Dolly Parton also gave a live interview, confirming this.

When Houston won the Best Pop Vocal Performance, Female award at the 1994 Grammy Awards for her recording, Parton (along with [[David Foster]]) presented her with the award.

In a statement to ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' mourning Houston's death in February 2012, Parton said:<blockquote>Mine is only one of the millions of hearts broken over the death of Whitney Houston. I will always be grateful and in awe of the wonderful performance she did on my song and I can truly say from the bottom of my heart, 'Whitney, I will always love you. You will be missed.'<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/506200/dolly-parton-whitney-i-will-always-love-you |title=Dolly Parton: 'Whitney, I Will Always Love You' |work=Billboard |access-date=2014-03-31}}</ref></blockquote>

===Music video===
The single's music video is credited to [[Alan Smithee]] ([[Nick Brandt]] removed his name due to the way [[Clive Davis]] re-edited the video), and produced by Rob Newman. It begins with the performance of the song Houston gives at the end of ''The Bodyguard''. The video then cuts to the singer in a dark blue suit sitting in an empty theater with the spotlight shining on her, singing of her love, and when she starts her dramatic vocal final shout, the theater changes into open camp surrounded by snow, which is meant to be at Fallen Leaf Lake, California, where ''The Bodyguard''{{'}}s boat scene was filmed. The video is interspersed with scenes from the film and gives the viewer the experience of reliving the moments with Houston. At the time of the video's shooting the singer was pregnant with her daughter Bobbi Kristina, so she is shown only sitting in the theater scenes.<ref>{{cite web|last=Kaufman |first=Gil |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1679194/whitney-houston-greatest-videos.jhtml |title=Whitney Houston's Greatest Videos |publisher=MTV |date=February 14, 2012 |access-date=March 31, 2014}}</ref> On October 24, 2020, the video for "I Will Always Love You" reached one billion views on YouTube. It is the seventh music video of the 20th century, and the first by a solo artist, to reach the milestone.

===Tributes===
[[Jennifer Hudson]] performed the song in front of Houston, who received [[The BET Honors|The BET Honors Award]] for Entertainer Lifetime Achievement spanning over 25 years in the industry. The 2010 BET Honors Awards was held at the Warner Theatre in Washington, D.C. and aired on February 1, 2010.
Since Houston's death in 2012, many other artists have performed tributes to the late singer's version of the song, including on February 12, 2012, when Hudson performed the song as a tribute during the [[54th Annual Grammy Awards]], the day after Houston's death, alongside images of musicians who had died in 2011 and 2012, including [[Amy Winehouse]] and [[Etta James]]. The song was played at Houston's funeral as her casket was brought out of the church. Parton complimented Hudson on her performance, saying,<blockquote>I was brought to tears again last night, as I'm sure many were, when Jennifer Hudson sang "I Will Always Love You" on the Grammys in memory of Whitney. Like everybody else, I am still in shock. But I know that Whitney will live forever in all the great music that she left behind. I will always have a very special piece of her in the song we shared together and had the good fortune to share with the world. Rest in peace, Whitney. Again, we will always love you.<ref>{{cite web|title=Whitney Houston's 'I Will Always Love You': Behind The Song|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1679201/whitney-houston-i-will-always-love-you.jhtml|access-date=2 May 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Kaufman |first=Gil |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1679178/2012-grammy-ratings-jennifer-hudson-tribute-whitney-houston.jhtml |title=Grammy Ratings Up Thanks To Adele, Whitney Houston Tribute |publisher=MTV |date=2012-02-13 |access-date=2014-03-31}}</ref></blockquote>

British pop, [[electronic dance music|electronic dance]] and [[Hi-NRG]] singer Sarah Washington released a successful dance-[[cover version|cover]] of "'''I Will Always Love You'''" in 1993. It became her highest charting hit to date, reaching number 3 in Spain, number 12 in the United Kingdom,<ref name="officialcharts">[https://www.officialcharts.com/artists/ Artist discography] OfficialCharts.com. Retrieved March 31, 2009.</ref> number 15 in Ireland and number 32 in Sweden. On the [[Eurochart Hot 100]], it peaked at number 44 in September 1993.

The remake was released on [[Almighty Records]], which described Washington as "an eager young hopeful" and cited her "sensational studio performance" as being key to the ultimate success of the track, also giving credit to London radio station [[95.8 Capital FM]] and its heavy rotation of the song.<ref>[http://www.almightyrecords.com/product/ALMY033/ Sarah Washington: I Will Always Love You] Almighty Solar Site. Retrieved March 31, 2009.</ref> A black-and-white music video was made to accompany the song. In 2006, Almighty Records released an 11-mixes package of "I Will Always Love You".

===Critical reception===
[[Larry Flick]] from ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' commented on the song, "There are no less than nine dance music covers of the [[Whitney Houston]] megahit "I Will Always Love You". So far, only Sarah Washington's hi-NRG rendering on Almighty Records is worth a spin."<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rw8EAAAAMBAJ|title=DanceTRAX|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=March 6, 1993|access-date=February 22, 2020}}</ref>
