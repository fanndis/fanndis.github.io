In June 2010, Soubry met the transport minister [[Norman Baker]] and called for the £400,000,000 extension to the [[Nottingham Express Transit]] tram system to be scrapped, saying the money would be better spent on the [[A453 road]].

She expressed dismay at the time and cost of replying to each constituent when she had already discussed the issue with the [[Communication Workers Union (UK)|Communication Workers' Union]] (CWU).<ref name=octbeest/> Twelve days later, Soubry announced in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] that of the 700 postal workers in her constituency, to her knowledge, none had written to her opposing privatisation of Royal Mail and only two had come to London.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2010-10-27a.346.0&s=anna+soubry#g404.0 |title=Postal Services Bill House of Commons debates, 27 October 2010, 1:55 pm |website=TheyWorkForYou |date=27 October 2010 |accessdate=14 November 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121024231109/http://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2010-10-27a.346.0&s=anna+soubry#g404.0 |archivedate=24 October 2012}}</ref>

After complaints from the CWU, Soubry agreed she was wrong, but said that some of the letters had been misfiled and others had arrived late or were sent to the wrong MP, and that the CWU had been inefficient. She claimed she genuinely believed she was telling the truth, that the bill protected Royal Mail, its workers and the universal postal service, and said that was the only reason she supported it.<ref name="post">{{cite web |url=http://www.thisisnottingham.co.uk/news/Postal-workers-union-writes-Parliament-MP-s-statement/article-2851792-detail/article.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130505132256/http://www.thisisnottingham.co.uk/news/Postal-workers-union-writes-Parliament-MP-s-statement/article-2851792-detail/article.html |url-status=dead |archivedate=5 May 2013 |title=Postal workers' union writes to Parliament over MP's statement |last=Monk |first=Delia |date=9 November 2010 |website=This is Nottingham |accessdate=10 November 2010}}</ref>

====Support for Citizens' Advice Bureau====
In November 2010, Soubry appeared on the [[East Midlands]] version of ''[[The Politics Show]]'' to discuss her efforts to help the [[Citizens' Advice Bureau]]. The programme reviewed the current state of Nottinghamshire's CAB which was facing a 30% increase in enquiries plus cuts in its budget from local councils and the Ministry of Justice.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-nottinghamshire-11681945 |title=Nottinghamshire advice service faces funding crisis |publisher=BBC News |date=3 November 2010 |accessdate=29 November 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101107123317/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-nottinghamshire-11681945 |archivedate=7 November 2010 |url-status=live}}</ref> Soubry said she had asked the leader of Nottingham County Council and [[Kenneth Clarke]] to reconsider. Soubry later organised a meeting between the CAB, Midlands Women's Aid and charities minister [[Nick Hurd]] to make him aware of the effects of the proposed cuts in funding to these organisations.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.annasoubry.org.uk/sites/www.annasoubry.org.uk/files/newsletter_23rd_february_2011.pdf |date=23 February 2011 |title=Newsletter: Yes Minister? |website=Anna Soubry MP |accessdate=9 March 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130103060251/http://www.annasoubry.org.uk/sites/www.annasoubry.org.uk/files/newsletter_23rd_february_2011.pdf |archivedate=3 January 2013}}</ref>

====HS2 (High Speed Rail)====
In January 2013, Soubry welcomed the announcement of the proposed [[High Speed 2]] [[East Midlands Hub]] station at [[Toton TMD|Toton Sidings]] in the constituency, stating that it was "a very good news day for Broxtowe". She has held a number of public meetings on the issue.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.annasoubry.org.uk/sites/www.annasoubry.org.uk/files/28th_january_hs2_newsletter.pdf |first=Anna |last=Soubry |title=Newsletter: HS2 – investing in Broxtowe |website=Anna Soubry MP |date=28 January 2013 |accessdate=11 November 2017 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170611154532/https://www.annasoubry.org.uk/sites/www.annasoubry.org.uk/files/28th_january_hs2_newsletter.pdf |archivedate=11 June 2017}}</ref>

Soubry voiced criticism in August 2013 over plans to not hold a public consultation meeting in the constituency, calling on HS2 Ltd to hold an event in Toton where the proposed East Midlands Hub is to be built.<ref>{{cite news |last= |first= |url=http://www.thisisnottingham.co.uk/MP-Soubry-protests-lack-local-HS2-consultation/story-19637771-detail/story.html |title=MP Soubry protests at lack of local HS2 consultation events |newspaper=Nottingham Post |date=9 August 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140528013912/http://www.nottinghampost.com/MP-Soubry-protests-lack-local-HS2-consultation/story-19637771-detail/story.html |archivedate=28 May 2014}}</ref>

====Smoking====
In a [[Westminster Hall]] debate, Soubry emphasised the role advertising plays in encouraging young people to smoke.<ref name=pete>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/10283722/Anna-Soubry-I-took-up-smoking-as-a-teen-because-of-gorgeous-packets.html |title=Anna Soubry: I took up smoking as a teen because of 'gorgeous' packets |first=Peter |last=Dominiczak |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |location=London |date=3 September 2013 |accessdate=4 September 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130907212049/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/10283722/Anna-Soubry-I-took-up-smoking-as-a-teen-because-of-gorgeous-packets.html |archivedate=7 September 2013 }}</ref> She herself took up smoking as a teenager because of the attractive packaging and she compared [[Nicotine dependence|addiction to nicotine]] to [[Opioid use disorder|heroin dependence]]; though she had no direct experience of the latter.<ref name=pete/> According to ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', her comments raised questions about why the [[Cameron–Clegg coalition|Coalition]] dropped plans for plain packaging shortly after David Cameron employed [[Lynton Crosby]], who has worked for tobacco companies, as an election strategist.<ref name=pete/>

===Ministerial career===
Following her appointment as [[Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State]] for Public Health in September 2012, Soubry gave an interview with ''[[The Times]]'' in which she stated her support for assisted suicide for terminally ill people.<ref name=rtd>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-19527769 |title=Right-to-die law appalling, says Health Minister Anna Soubry |publisher=BBC News |date=8 September 2012 |accessdate=8 September 2012 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120910173935/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-19527769 |archivedate=10 September 2012}}</ref> Both the Department of Health and the Ministry of Justice denied there were plans for reform, though her [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]] colleague [[Norman Lamb]] welcomed discussion and said he expected a private members' bill to be introduced by [[Lord Falconer]] in 2013.<ref name=rtd/> Assisting suicide currently carries a maximum 14-year prison sentence.<ref name=rtd/>

On 14 September 2012, speaking at an [[NHS]] Leadership Academy conference, Soubry stated that the Coalition had "screwed up" in the way it dealt with the medical profession over the NHS reforms.<ref name=screw>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/9544095/We-screwed-up-health-minister-on-NHS-reforms.html |title='We screwed up' – health minister on NHS reforms |first=James |last=Kirkup |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date=14 September 2012 |accessdate=15 September 2012 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120915005957/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/9544095/We-screwed-up-health-minister-on-NHS-reforms.html |archivedate=15 September 2012 }}</ref>
Soubry later said that she fully supported the reforms but believed the benefits to patients could have been better explained and this would have won more support from health professionals.<ref name=screw/>

As Public Health Minister, Soubry criticised retailers who forced customers to pass "rows of unhealthy foods" on their way to the checkout and said that a new code of practice would urge retailers to stop this and also reduce deals on unhealthy food.<ref name=alice>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/10179235/Supermarkets-to-abolish-checkout-guilt-lanes.html |title=Supermarkets to abolish checkout 'guilt lanes' |first=Alice |last=Philipson |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |date=15 July 2013 |accessdate=29 July 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130802053912/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/10179235/Supermarkets-to-abolish-checkout-guilt-lanes.html |archivedate=2 August 2013 }}</ref>

Soubry was appointed Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Defence in David Cameron's October 2013 reshuffle, becoming the first elected female politician to be a Minister in the MoD. In the July 2014 reshuffle, Soubry was appointed [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Minister of State for Defence Personnel, Welfare and Veterans]].<ref name="p.uk">{{cite web |url=http://www.parliament.uk/biographies/commons/anna-soubry/3938 |title=Anna Soubry MP |website=Parliament.uk |accessdate=12 November 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141112200037/http://www.parliament.uk/biographies/commons/anna-soubry/3938 |archivedate=12 November 2014 }}</ref>

Following the 2015 general election, Soubry became Minister of State at the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills until 15 July 2016.

In September 2016, Soubry criticised members of [[Vote Leave]] when it became clear that the pledge "at the heart &hellip; of their message" of £350,000,000 a week of extra funding for the NHS was being dropped from post-Brexit plans.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/10/brexit-camp-abandons-350-million-pound-nhs-pledge |title=Brexit camp abandons £350M a week NHS funding pledge |newspaper=[[The Observer]] |last=Helm |first=Toby |date=10 September 2016 |accessdate=11 September 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160911084716/http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/10/brexit-camp-abandons-350-million-pound-nhs-pledge |archivedate=11 September 2016}}</ref> Following a leaked [[HM Treasury|Treasury]] report which claimed that the estimated annual cost to the UK Treasury of a "hard Brexit" would be between £38bn and £66bn per year after 15 years, Soubry referenced the loss of money for schools and hospitals and stated that Parliament should be involved in the principles guiding Brexit negotiations.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/10/11/revealed-hard-brexit-will-cost-britain-66billion-per-year/ |title='Hard Brexit' will cost Britain £66 billion per year, claims controversial leaked Treasury report |first=Michael |last=Wilkinson |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |date=11 October 2016 |accessdate=11 October 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161011094839/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/10/11/revealed-hard-brexit-will-cost-britain-66billion-per-year/ |archivedate=11 October 2016}}</ref>

They referred to her as "on the side of [[Adolf Hitler]]" and called her a traitor for her anti-Brexit stance.<ref>{{cite news |first=Mark |last=Townsend |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/dec/23/police-probe-far-right-yellow-vest-group-anna-soubry |title=Police probe far-right 'yellow vest' group that intimidated Anna Soubry |newspaper=The Guardian |date=23 December 2018 |accessdate=20 February 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190102202011/https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/dec/23/police-probe-far-right-yellow-vest-group-anna-soubry |archive-date=2 January 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first=Peter |last=Walker |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/dec/20/anna-soubry-accosted-pro-brexit-supporters-hitler |date=20 December 2018 |title='You're on the side of Hitler': Anna Soubry accosted by pro-Brexit supporters |newspaper=The Guardian |accessdate=20 February 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190221112113/https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/dec/20/anna-soubry-accosted-pro-brexit-supporters-hitler |archive-date=21 February 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> This was met with condemnation from MPs of all sides of the political spectrum, and by the [[Speaker of the House of Commons (United Kingdom)|Speaker of the House of Commons]], [[John Bercow]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-46789601 |title=Police under pressure over MP harassment |date=8 January 2019 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=12 January 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190112052649/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-46789601 |archive-date=12 January 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> In February 2019, James Goddard, one of the activists who accosted Soubry, was charged with harassment in connection with the incident in December 2018 and a separate incident outside Parliament in January 2019.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-47296821 |title=Soubry protester James Goddard charged with harassment |publisher=BBC News |date=19 February 2019 |accessdate=20 February 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190220191217/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-47296821 |archive-date=20 February 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>

===The Independent Group===
Soubry resigned from the Conservative Party on 20 February 2019, along with [[Heidi Allen]] and [[Sarah Wollaston]], and joined The Independent Group, later [[Change UK]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Three MPs quit Tory party to join breakaway group |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-47306022 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=20 February 2019 |date=20 February 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191130130843/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-47306022 |archive-date=30 November 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> Soubry stated that "the right wing, the hard-line anti-EU awkward squad" had hijacked the Conservative Party from top to toe.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/independent-group-tory-mps-anna-soubry-sarah-wollaston-heidi-allen-brexit-a8788391.html |title=Ex-Tory MP says battle for party is over because 'hardline, right-wing, awkward squad' has won |date=20 February 2019 |work=The Independent |accessdate=24 February 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190224232847/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/independent-group-tory-mps-anna-soubry-sarah-wollaston-heidi-allen-brexit-a8788391.html |archive-date=24 February 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Following the new party's failure to win at the [[2019 United Kingdom general election|December 2019 general election]], Soubry announced that the Independent Group for Change would be disbanded. All three of the party's MPs who sought re-election were defeated with Soubry coming "a distant third in Broxtowe". Soubry stated that while there was "a need for massive change in British politics," without representation in parliament "a longer-term realignment will have to take place in a different way".<ref name="BBCnews19122019">{{cite news |title=General election 2019: Anna Soubry disbands Independent Group for Change |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-50858811 |accessdate=19 December 2019 |work=BBC News |date=19 December 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191219195013/https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-50858811 |archive-date=19 December 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>
