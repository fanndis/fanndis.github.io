The '''National Gallery of Australia''' (originally the '''Australian National Gallery''') is the national [[art museum]] of Australia as well as one of the [[list of largest art museums|largest]] art museums in [[Australia]], holding more than 166,000 works of art.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nga.gov.au/AboutUs/Reports/NGA_AR_11-12.pdf |publisher=National Gallery of Australia|title= Annual Report 2011-12|access-date=8 June 2014}}</ref> Located in [[Canberra]] in the [[Australian Capital Territory]], it was established in 1967 by the [[Government of Australia|Australian government]] as a national public art museum.

== Establishment ==
Prominent Australian artist [[Tom Roberts]] had lobbied various Australian prime ministers, starting with the first, [[Edmund Barton]].  Prime Minister [[Andrew Fisher]] accepted the idea in 1910, and the following year Parliament established a bipartisan committee of six political leaders—the ''Historic Memorials Committee''.  The Committee decided that the government should collect portraits of Australian [[Governor-General of Australia|governors-general]], parliamentary leaders and the principal "fathers" of [[Federation of Australia|federation]] to be painted by Australian artists.  This led to the establishment of what became known as the ''Commonwealth Art Advisory Board'', which was responsible for art acquisitions until 1973.  Nevertheless, the ''Parliamentary Library Committee'' also collected paintings for the Australian collections of the ''Commonwealth Parliamentary Library'', including landscapes, notably the acquisition of Tom Roberts' ''[[Bourke Street (painting)|Allegro con brio, Bourke St West]]'' in 1918.  Prior to the opening of the Gallery these paintings were displayed around Parliament House, in Commonwealth offices, including diplomatic missions overseas, and State Galleries.

From 1912, the building of a permanent building to house the collection in Canberra was the major priority of the Commonwealth Art Advisory Board.  However, this period included two World Wars and a [[Great Depression|Depression]] and governments always considered they had more pressing priorities, including building the initial infrastructure of Canberra and [[Old Parliament House, Canberra|Old Parliament House]] in the 1920s and the rapid expansion of Canberra and the building of government offices, [[Lake Burley Griffin]] and the [[National Library of Australia]] in the 1950s and early 1960s.  In 1965 the Commonwealth Art Advisory Board was finally able to persuade Prime Minister [[Robert Menzies]] to take the steps necessary to establish the gallery.<ref>{{cite book  | last = Green | first = Pauleen (ed) | title = Building the Collection  | publisher = National Gallery of Australia  | year = 2003 | pages = 408 | isbn = 0-642-54202-3  }}, pp2-9</ref>  On 1 November 1967, Prime Minister [[Harold Holt]] formally announced that the Government would construct the building.

=== Location ===
The design of the building was complicated by the difficulty in finalising its location, which was affected by the layout of the [[Parliamentary Triangle, Canberra|Parliamentary Triangle]].  The main problem was the final site of the new [[Parliament House, Canberra|Parliament House]].  In Canberra's original [[Walter Burley Griffin|Griffin]] 1912 plan, Parliament House was to be built on Camp Hill, between Capital Hill and the [[Old Parliament House, Canberra|Provisional Parliament House]] and a ''Capitol'' was to be built on top of [[Capital Hill, Australian Capital Territory|Capital Hill]].  He envisaged the Capitol to be "either a general administration structure for popular receptions and ceremony or for housing archives and commemorating Australian Achievements".<ref>{{cite book  | title = Parliamentary Zone Development Plan| publisher = [[National Capital Development Commission]] | year = 1982| pages = 125 | isbn = 0-642-88974-0  }}, p12</ref>  In the early 1960s, the [[National Capital Development Commission]] (NCDC) proposed, in accordance with the 1958 and 1964 [[William Graham Holford|Holford]] plans for the Parliamentary Triangle, that the site for the new Parliament House be moved to the shore of Lake Burley Griffin, with a vast ''National Place'', to be built on its south side, to be surrounded by a large mass of buildings.  The Gallery would be built on [[Capital Hill, Australian Capital Territory|Capital Hill]], along with other national cultural institutions.<ref>''Parliamentary Zone Development Plan'', pp20-1</ref>

In 1968, [[Colin Madigan]] of Edwards Madigan Torzillo and Partners won the competition for the design, even though no design could be finalised, as the final site was now in doubt. Prime Minister [[John Gorton]] stated that,
:"The Competition had as its aim not a final design for the building but rather the selection of a vigorous and imaginative architect who would then be commissioned to submit the actual design of the Gallery."<ref>''Green'': p. 339</ref>

Gorton proposed to Parliament in 1968 that it endorse Holford's lakeside site for the new Parliament House, but it refused and sites at Camp Hill and Capital Hill were then investigated. As a result, the Government decided that the Gallery could not be built on Capital Hill.<ref>''Parliamentary Zone Development Plan'', p23</ref>  In 1971, the Government selected a {{convert|17|ha|adj=on}} site on the eastern side of the proposed ''National Place'', between King Edward Terrace and for the Gallery. Even though it was now unlikely that the lakeside Parliament House would proceed, a raised ''National Place'' (to hide parking stations) surrounded by national institutions and government offices was still planned.<ref>''Parliamentary Zone Development Plan'', pp23-4</ref> Madigan's brief included the Gallery, a building for the [[High Court of Australia]] and the precinct around them, linking to the raised ''National Place'' at the centre of the Land Axis of the Parliamentary Triangle, which then led to the National Library on the western side.

===Development of the design===
Madigan's final design was based on a brief prepared by the [[National Capital Development Commission]] (NCDC) with input from [[James Johnson Sweeney]] and [[James Mollison]].  Sweeney was director of the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum|Guggenheim Museum]] between 1952–1960 and director of [[The Museum of Fine Arts, Houston]] and had been appointed as a consultant to advise on issues concerning the display and storage of art.  Mollison said in 1989 that "the size and form of the building had been determined between Colin Madigan and J.J. Sweeney, and the National Capital Development Commission. I was not able to alter the appearance of the interior or exterior in any way...It's a very difficult building in which to make art look more important than the space in which you put the art".<ref>''Green'' : pp. 379–80</ref>  The construction of the building commenced in 1973, with the unveiling of a plaque by Prime Minister [[Gough Whitlam]]. Construction was managed by P.D.C. Constructions under the supervision of the National Capital Development Commission and it was officially opened by [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] in 1982, during the premiership of Whitlam's successor, [[Malcolm Fraser]]. The building cost $82 million.

In 1975, the NCDC abandoned the plan for the ''National Place'', leaving the precinct five metres above the natural ground level, without the previously proposed connections to national institutions <ref>{{cite web

  | access-date = 3 November 2006 }}</ref> and next to a vast space only partially taken up by [[Reconciliation Place]], which does not substitute for the grand mass of buildings originally envisaged.

===Appointment of an acting director===

The Commonwealth Art Advisory Board recommended that Laurie Thomas, a former director of the [[Art Gallery of Western Australia]] and of the [[Queensland Art Gallery]] be appointed director, but the Prime Minister [[John Gorton]] took no action on this recommendation, as he apparently favoured the appointment of [[James Johnson Sweeney]], although he was already 70.

[[James Mollison]] was exhibitions officer in the [[Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet (Australia)|Prime Minister's Department]] from 1969 and the Government's failure to appoint a director of the National Gallery of Australia required Mollison to become involved in the development of the design for the building with the architects led by Colin Madigan.  In November 1970, the Commonwealth Art Advisory Board recommended that he should be re-designated as assistant director (development).  In May 1971, following Gorton's fall from power, the Government endorsed Madigan's sketches for the building.  The new Prime Minister, [[William McMahon]] announced the appointment of Mollison as acting director of the National Gallery of Australia in October 1971.  Tenders for construction were called in November 1972, just before the McMahon government's defeat in the December 1972 election.<ref>''Green'' : pp14-17</ref>

=== Building ===
[[File:NGA Canberra-01JAC.jpg|thumb|right|Prior to renovations, in 2004]]
The National Gallery building is in the late 20th-century [[Brutalist]] style.  It is characterised by angular masses and raw concrete surfaces and is surrounded by a series of sculpture gardens planted with Australian native plants and trees.

The geometry of the building is based on a triangle, most obviously manifested for visitors in the coffered ceiling grids and tiles of the principal floor. Madigan said of this device that it was "the intention of the architectural concept to implant into the grammar of the design a sense of freedom so that the building could be submitted to change and variety but would always express its true purpose".  This geometry flows throughout the building, and is reflected in the triangular stair towers, columns and building elements.

The building is principally constructed of reinforced [[bush hammer]]ed concrete, which was also originally the interior wall surface.  More recently, the interior walls have been covered with painted wood, to allow for increased flexibility in the display of artworks.

The building has 23,000 m<sup>2</sup> of floor space. The design provides space for both the display and storage of works of art and to accommodate the curatorial and support staff of the Gallery. Madigan's design is based on Sweeney's recommendation that there should be a spiral plan, with a succession of galleries to display works of art of differing sizes and to allow flexibility in the way in which they were to be exhibited.

There are three levels of galleries.  On the principal floor, the galleries are large, and are used to display the Indigenous Australian and International (meaning European and American) collections. The bottom level also contains a series of large galleries, originally intended to house sculpture, but now used to display the Asian art collection. The topmost level contains a series of smaller, more intimate galleries, which are now used to display the Gallery's collection of Australian art. Sweeney had recommended that sources of natural light should not detract from the collections, and so light sources are intended to be indirect.

The High Court and National Gallery Precinct were added to the [[Australian National Heritage List]] in November 2007.<ref>[http://www.environment.gov.au/heritage/places/national/high-court-national-art-gallery/index.html Australian National Heritage listing for the High Court-National Gallery Precinct]</ref>

[[Image:Lobby of national art gallery.jpg|thumb|500px|center|Lobby area of the National Gallery of Australia in 2005, before the major extension completed in 2010.]]

===Later extensions===
The Gallery has been extended twice, the first of which was the building of new temporary exhibition galleries on the eastern side of the building in 1997, to house large-scale temporary exhibitions, which was designed by [[Andrew Andersons]] of [[PTW Architects]]. This extension includes a sculptural garden, designed by [[Fiona Margaret Hall|Fiona Hall]]. The 2006 enhancement project and new entrance was complemented by a large Australian Garden designed by [http://mcgregorcoxall.com/people/9#/people/9 Adrian McGregor] of [http://www.mcgregorcoxall.com McGregor Coxall] Landscape Architecture and Urban Design.

There have also been proposals, during the tenure of Director [[Brian Kennedy (Gallery director)|Brian Kennedy]], for the construction of a new "front" entrance, facing King Edward Terrace. Madigan made known his concerns about these proposals and their interference with his moral rights as the architect and also expressed concerns about these changes.<ref>{{cite news  | author = Lauren Martin |title = Gallery defiant over redesign |url = http://www.smh.com.au/news/arts/gallery-defiant-over-redesign/2005/10/18/1129401253238.html |work = [[Sydney Morning Herald]] |date = 19 October 2005 |access-date = 14 October 2006 }}</ref> A former director, [[Betty Churcher]], was particularly critical of Madigan, and told a journalist that "the dead hand of an architect cannot stay clamped on a building forever".<ref>{{cite news |last1=Meacham |first1=Steve |title=Designs on his landmark leave architect in distress |url=https://www.smh.com.au/national/designs-on-his-landmark-leave-architect-in-distress-20060925-gdogki.html |access-date=28 April 2019 |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |date=25 September 2006}}</ref> When Ron Radford became director, he expanded the brief to include a suite of new galleries to display the collection of indigenous art and a new Australian Garden fronting King Edward Terrace.

The Minister for the Arts and Sport, Senator [[Rod Kemp]], announced on 13 December 2006 that the Australian Government would provide $92.9 million for a major building enhancement project at the National Gallery of Australia, including around $20 million for previously approved building refurbishments. The building enhancements were designed to create new arrival and entrance facilities to improve public access to the Gallery's building and significantly increase display space, particularly for the collection of Australian Indigenous art.<ref>{{cite press release

Stage 1 of the indigenous galleries and new entrance project was officially opened on 30 September 2010 by [[Quentin Bryce]], [[Governor-General of Australia]].<ref name="NGA official website">{{cite web | url=http://nga.gov.au/AboutUs/building/index.cfm | title=National Gallery of Australia | access-date=2011-01-01}}</ref> According to well known architecture critic [[Elizabeth Farrelly]], the new extension had three main tasks: "how to dock amicably with the existing architecture; how to provide the resulting whole with a new street 'address'; how to create a logical, legible and deferential hanging space for the collection."<ref>{{cite news | title=Watch this space - Brutalism meets beauty in the National Gallery's new wing | author=Farrelly, Elizabeth | date=2010-10-09 | publisher=The Sydney Morning Herald. "Spectrum" section | pages=16–17}}</ref>

== Directorship ==
In 1976, the newly established ANG Council advertised for a permanent director to fill the position that [[James Mollison]] had been acting in since 1971.  The new Prime Minister [[Malcolm Fraser]] announced the appointment of Mollison as director in 1977.

===James Mollison===
[[James Mollison]] is notable for establishing the Gallery and building on the collection that had already been assembled of mainly Australian paintings by purchasing icons of modern western art, the best known were the 1974 purchases of ''[[Number 11, 1952 (painting)|Blue Poles]]'' by [[Jackson Pollock]] ($1.3m), and ''Woman V'' by [[Willem de Kooning]] ($650,000). These purchases were very controversial at the time, but are now generally considered to be visionary acquisitions.

He also built up the other collections, often with the help of donations.  Starting in 1973 Mollison secured funding from Philip Morris to acquire contemporary Australian photography for the ANG, though Ian North was not appointed Foundation Curator of Photography until 1980.<ref>{{Citation|author1=Philip Morris (Australia)|title=Australian photographers : the Philip Morris Collection|publication-date=1979|publisher=Philip Morris (Australia)Ltd|isbn=978-0-9500941-1-3|author2=Mollison, James, 1931-}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|author1=King, Natalie, 1966-, (editor.)|title=Up close : Carol Jerrems with Larry Clark, Nan Goldin and William Yang|publication-date=2010|publisher=Heide Museum of Modern Art : Schwartz City|isbn=978-1-86395-501-0|author2=Jerrems, Carol, 1949-1980, (photographer.)|author3=Clark, Larry, 1943-, (photographer.)|author4=Goldin, Nan, 1953-, (photographer.)|author5=Yang, William, 1943-, (photographer.)|author6=Heide Museum of Modern Art, (host institution.)}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://photocurating.net/?p=499|title=Ian North, Foundation Curator of Photography, National Gallery of Australia {{!}} Curating Photography|last=Interviews|first=Daniel Palmer-Published: 30/11/2016 – Category:|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-24}}</ref> In 1975, [[Arthur Boyd]] presented several thousand of his works to the Gallery.  In 1977 Mollison persuaded [[Sunday Reed]] to donate [[Sidney Nolan]]'s remarkable [[Ned Kelly]] series to the ANG.  Nolan had long disputed Reed's ownership of these paintings, but the donation resolved their dispute.<ref>{{cite book

He also arranged many touring exhibitions, most famously ''The Great [[Impressionist]] Exhibition'' of 1984.

His successor, [[Betty Churcher]] has said that when she took over in 1990, he "was of almost legendary stature [and] had single-handedly built a great and comprehensive collection from the ground up; indeed he had presided over the collection for more than twenty years with great flair, and over the institution for seven years — it was in the truest sense, his Gallery, his professional achievement."<ref>''Green'': p175</ref>

===Betty Churcher===
[[Betty Churcher]] became director in 1990. She had been formerly director of the [[Art Gallery of Western Australia]]. While director of the National Gallery, she was dubbed "Betty Blockbuster" because of her love of blockbuster exhibitions.

Churcher initiated the building of new galleries on the eastern side of the building, opened in March 1998, to house large-scale temporary exhibitions.  It was under her directorship that the name of the Gallery was changed from the Australian National Gallery to its current title.

During her period, the Gallery purchased, among many other artworks, ''[[Golden Summer, Eaglemont]]'' by [[Arthur Streeton]] for $3.5 million.  This was the last great [[Heidelberg School]] painting still in private hands.<ref>''Green'': p174</ref>

===Brian Kennedy===
[[Brian Kennedy (gallery director)|Brian Kennedy]] was appointed director in 1997.  He expanded the traveling exhibitions and loans program throughout Australia, arranged for several major shows of Australian art abroad, increased the number of exhibitions at the museum itself and oversaw the development of an extensive multi-media site. On the other hand, he discontinued the emphasis of his predecessor, Churcher, of showing ''blockbuster'' exhibitions.

During his directorship, the National Gallery of Australia gained government support for improving the building and significant private donations and corporate sponsorship. Private funding supported his notable acquisitions of [[David Hockney]]'s ''A Bigger Grand Canyon'' for $4.6 million in 1999, [[Lucian Freud]]'s ''After Cézanne'' for $7.4 million in 2001 and ''Pregnant Woman'' by [[Ron Mueck]] for $800,000.

He also introduced free admission to the gallery, except to major exhibitions. He campaigned for the construction of a new ''front'' entrance to the Gallery, facing King Edward Terrace, but this did not come to pass during his tenure.

Kennedy's cancellation of the [[Sensation exhibition]] (scheduled at the National Gallery of Australia from 2 June 2000 to 13 August 2000) was controversial, as it was seen by many as censorship. This exhibition was created by the [[Young British Artists]] of the [[Saatchi Gallery]]. Its most controversial work was [[Chris Ofili]]’s ''[[The Holy Virgin Mary]]'', a painting which used elephant dung and was accused of being blasphemous. The then Mayor of New York, [[Rudolph Giuliani]] campaigned against the exhibition, claiming it was "Catholic-bashing" and an "aggressive vicious, disgusting attack on religion." In November 1999, Kennedy cancelled the exhibition and stated that the events in New York had "obscured discussion of the artistic merit of the works of art."<ref>{{cite web| author = Valerie M. Arvidson |title = A Curator from the Outback
|url = http://www.dartmouth.edu/~thepress/read.php?id=774 |work = Dartmouth Free Press |year = 2006 |access-date = 14 October 2006 }}</ref>

Kennedy was also repeatedly under attack over allegations that the air-conditioning was exposing its staff to cancer. Despite his denials that there was any problem with the air-conditioning, claims that the issue had been 'swept under the carpet' persisted.  The air-conditioning was finally renovated in 2003.<ref>{{cite web|  title = Passing on a 'poisoned chalice' |url = http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/02/13/1076548217313.html?from=storyrhs |work = [[The Age]] |date = 14 February 2004 |access-date = 14 October 2006 }}</ref> Kennedy announced that he would not seek extension of his contract in 2002. He has denied that he was under any government pressure to do so.

===Ron Radford===
[[Ron Radford]] was appointed director in late 2004. He was formerly director of the [[Art Gallery of South Australia]].

Radford has lent out the Gallery's old masters collection (European art, prior to the 19th century) for long-term display to state galleries, noting  that he "considers the collection of less than 30 paintings, put together by Mollison to give context to the modern collection, as too small to make any impact on the public". He has been quoted as saying that the gallery should concentrate on its strengths – European art of the first half of the 20th century, 20th-century American art, photography, Asian art and the 20th-century drawing collection, and to fill the gaps in the Australian collection.<ref>{{cite web|  title = Radford to banish old masters from NGA |url = http://www.canberra.yourguide.com.au/detail.asp?class=news&subclass=local&story_id=472737&category=general%20news&m=4&y=2006 |work = [[The Canberra Times]] |date = 12 April 2006 |access-date = 21 October 2006 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060503084940/http://canberra.yourguide.com.au/detail.asp?class=news&subclass=local&story_id=472737&category=general%20news&m=4&y=2006 <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archive-date = 3 May 2006}}</ref>

In September 2005, there was considerable publicity about an offer to the gallery of ''Sketch for Deluge II'' by [[Wassily Kandinsky]] for $35 million. The gallery did not subsequently go through with the purchase.

Radford has been notable in securing funding and completing the building of the new entrance to the Gallery as well as an extension for Indigenous galleries, public and function areas. In developing the collection he has been notable for a series of acquisitions of indigenous art, in particular the largest collection of watercolours by [[Albert Namatjira]] and the [[James Turrell]] sculpture and installation ''{{vanchor|Within without}}'' (2010).

===Gerard Vaughan===
In October 2014, it was announced that [[Gerard Vaughan (art historian)|Gerard Vaughan]] would be the new director of the National Gallery of Australia from 10 November. He was formerly director of the [[National Gallery of Victoria]] from 1999 to 2012.<ref>Debbie Cuthbertson, "Gerard Vaughan named National Gallery of Australia director".

Retrieved 17 October 2014</ref>

===Nick Mitzevich===
In April 2018, it was announced that [[Nick Mitzevich]], the third of the NGA directors to be appointed from the Art Gallery of South Australia, would take over at the start of July.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/national/act/nick-mitzevich-confirmed-new-boss-for-national-gallery-20180409-p4z8mc.html|title=Nick Mitzevich confirmed new boss for National Gallery|first=Doug|last=Dingwell|work=Sydney Morning Herald|date=9 April 2017|access-date=2 July 2018}}</ref>
