The '''Progress Party''', initially known as the '''Workers Party''', was a minor [[political party in Australia]] in the mid-to-late 1970s. It was formed on 26 January ([[Australia Day]]) 1975, as a [[free-market]] [[right-libertarian]] and [[anti-socialist]] party, by businessmen [[John Singleton (Australian entrepreneur)|John Singleton]] and Sinclair Hill, in reaction to the economic policies of [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] prime minister [[Gough Whitlam]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cis.org.au/policy/summer01-02/PolicySummer01_4.html|title=CIS at Twenty-Five - Frank Devine talks to Greg Lindsay|publisher=Centre for Independent Studies|date=December 2001|accessdate=2008-07-16|url-status=dead|archiveurl=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20091009225700/http://www.cis.org.au/policy/summer01-02/PolicySummer01_4.html|archivedate=9 October 2009|df=dmy-all}}</ref> It operated and ran candidates in [[Western Australia]], the [[Northern Territory]], [[South Australia]], [[Queensland]] and [[New South Wales]], but it did not have a central federal structure. Its Western Australian affiliate, which advocated [[Secessionism in Western Australia|secession]] from the rest of Australia,<ref>{{cite book|title=Platform & policy and constitution|author=Westralian Progress Party|year=1977}} Accessed at [[Battye Library]], [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]].</ref><ref name=sawer>{{cite book|last=Sawer|first=Marian|title=Australia and the New Right|publisher=George Allen & Unwin|year=1982|isbn=0-86861-188-3|pages=5â€“7}}</ref> did particularly well in the area surrounding [[Geraldton, Western Australia|Geraldton]] in the state's [[Mid West (Western Australia)|Mid West]]. However, the party failed to win seats at any level of government and had gone out of existence by 1981.

The party's first electoral contest was the [[1975 Greenough state by-election|Greenough state by-election]], which took place following the retirement of former [[Premier of Western Australia|Premier]] [[David Brand]]. The candidate, Geoffrey McNeil, surprised most observers by attaining 12.96% of valid votes cast (only 0.66% less than the Labor candidate).<ref>{{cite journal |last= Penrose |first= Sandra |date=April 1976 |title= Australian Political Chronicle: July-December 1975 |journal= Australian Journal of Politics and History |volume= 22 |issue= 1 |pages= 112 |issn=0004-9522}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Election statistics : Legislative Assembly of Western Australia, 1890-1996|last=Black|first=David|author2=Prescott, Valerie |year=1997|publisher=Western Australian Parliamentary History Project|isbn=0-7309-8409-5|page=133}}</ref> Buoyed by that success, the Workers' Party ran three [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] and five [[Australian Senate|Senate]] candidates in Western Australia at the [[1975 Australian federal election|1975 federal election]].<ref>Penrose, p.114.</ref> Subsequently, the New South Wales party nominated candidates at 1976 by-elections in the seats of [[Electoral district of Pittwater|Pittwater]] and [[Electoral district of The Hills|The Hills]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/2069390|title= Records of the Workers Party (Australia), 1975-1981 (manuscript)|author=[[National Library of Australia]]|accessdate=2008-07-16}}</ref>

The party was renamed the Progress Party after objections to the name and constitution, and the Westralian Progress Party published its platform in 1977, ahead of the February [[1977 Western Australian state election|state election]], at which it contested the seats of [[Electoral district of Greenough|Greenough]] (achieving 16.81% of the vote), [[Electoral district of Geraldton|Geraldton]] (5.12%), [[Electoral district of Kalgoorlie|Kalgoorlie]] (6.43%), [[Electoral district of Mundaring|Mundaring]] (3.95%) and [[Electoral district of Yilgarn-Dundas|Yilgarn-Dundas]] (3.63%). At the August 1977 [[1977 Northern Territory general election|Northern Territory assembly elections]], the party picked up a territory-wide vote of 9.76%.

On 13 October 1977, sitting [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal]] MP [[Peter Richardson (politician)|Peter Richardson]] announced that he had defected to the Progress Party and would be its lead Senate candidate in Western Australia at the [[1977 Australian federal election|1977 federal election]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/110871777|title=WA Liberal resigns|newspaper=[[The Canberra Times]]|date=14 October 1977}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/110872064|title=Liberal Party member quits|newspaper=The Canberra Times|date=15 October 1977}}</ref> Another former Liberal MP, [[Wylie Gibbs]], also joined the party, but he did not run for office.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/110881744|title=Joined PP|newspaper=The Canberra Times|date=8 December 1977}}</ref> At the federal election, the Progress Party contested every Western Australian seat in the House of Representatives, but only managed to collect 2.83% of the statewide vote. Richardson was unsuccessful in his bid for the Senate, with the party polling just over 10,000 votes, or 1.7 percent of the state total.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://psephos.adam-carr.net/countries/a/australia/1977/1977senatewa.txt|title=1977 Senate - Western Australia|publisher=Australian Election Archive|access-date=2 May 2019}}</ref>

The party went on to contest the [[1980 Western Australian state election]], but achieved a significantly lower level of support.<ref>{{cite web|title=Political parties|work=Australian Government and Politics Database|publisher=[[University of Western Australia]]|url=http://elections.uwa.edu.au/partysearch3.lasso|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050616131219/http://elections.uwa.edu.au/partySearch3.lasso|url-status=dead|archive-date=2005-06-16|accessdate=2008-07-16 }}</ref> The party is believed to have disbanded after that, but academic [[Marian Sawer]] has credited it with attracting publicity for [[neoliberal]], [[economic rationalist]] ideals.<ref name=sawer/>
