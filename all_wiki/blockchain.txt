A '''blockchain''',{{R|te20151031|fortune20160515|nyt20160521}} originally '''block chain''',{{R|primer|obmh}} is a growing list of [[Record (computer science)|records]], called ''blocks'', that are linked using [[cryptography]].<ref name="te20151031" /><ref name="cryptocurrencytech">{{Cite book |last1=Narayanan |first1=Arvind |title=Bitcoin and cryptocurrency technologies: a comprehensive introduction |last2=Bonneau |first2=Joseph |last3=Felten |first3=Edward |last4=Miller |first4=Andrew |last5=Goldfeder |first5=Steven |date=2016 |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=978-0-691-17169-2 |location=Princeton}}</ref> Each block contains a [[Cryptographic hash function|cryptographic hash]] of the previous block,<ref name="cryptocurrencytech" /> a [[Trusted timestamping|timestamp]], and transaction data (generally represented as a [[Merkle tree]]).

By design, a blockchain is resistant to modification of its data. This is because once recorded, the data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively without alteration of all subsequent blocks. For use as a distributed ledger, a blockchain is typically managed by a [[peer-to-peer]] network collectively adhering to a [[Protocol (communication)|protocol]] for inter-node communication and validating new blocks.  Although blockchain records are not unalterable, blockchains may be considered [[secure by design]] and exemplify a distributed computing system with high [[Byzantine fault tolerance]]. The blockchain has been described as "an open, [[distributed ledger]] that can record [[transaction]]s between two parties efficiently and in a verifiable and permanent way".<ref name="hbr201701">{{Cite news |last1=Iansiti |first1=Marco |last2=Lakhani |first2=Karim R. |date=January 2017 |title=The Truth About Blockchain |work=[[Harvard Business Review]] |publisher=[[Harvard University]] |url=https://hbr.org/2017/01/the-truth-about-blockchain |url-status=live |access-date=2017-01-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170118052537/https://hbr.org/2017/01/the-truth-about-blockchain |archive-date=18 January 2017 |quote=The technology at the heart of bitcoin and other virtual currencies, blockchain is an open, distributed ledger that can record transactions between two parties efficiently and in a verifiable and permanent way. |df=dmy-all}}</ref>

The blockchain was invented by a person (or group of people) using the name [[Satoshi Nakamoto]] in 2008 to serve as the public transaction [[ledger]] of the [[cryptocurrency]] [[bitcoin]].{{R|te20151031}} The identity of Satoshi Nakamoto remains unknown to date.

== History ==
[[File:Confirmed Transactions Per Day.png|thumb|Right|220x220px|Bitcoin transactions (January 2009 – September 2017)]]
Cryptographer David Chaum first proposed a blockchain-like protocol in his 1982 dissertation "Computer Systems Established, Maintained, and Trusted by Mutually Suspicious Groups."<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Sherman |first1=Alan T. |last2=Javani |first2=Farid |last3=Zhang |first3=Haibin |last4=Golaszewski |first4=Enis |date=January 2019 |title=On the Origins and Variations of Blockchain Technologies |journal=IEEE Security Privacy |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=72–77 |arxiv=1810.06130 |doi=10.1109/MSEC.2019.2893730 |issn=1558-4046 |s2cid=53114747}}</ref> Further work on a cryptographically secured chain of blocks was described in 1991 by Stuart Haber and W.

The first blockchain was conceptualized by a person (or group of people) known as [[Satoshi Nakamoto]] in 2008. Nakamoto improved the design in an important way using a [[Hashcash]]-like method to [[Timestamp-based concurrency control|timestamp]] blocks without requiring them to be signed by a trusted party and introducing a difficulty parameter to stabilize rate with which blocks are added to the chain.{{r|cryptocurrencytech}} The design was implemented the following year by Nakamoto as a core component of the cryptocurrency [[bitcoin]], where it serves as the public [[ledger]] for all transactions on the network.{{R|te20151031}}

In August 2014, the bitcoin blockchain file size, containing records of all transactions that have occurred on the network, reached 20&nbsp;GB ([[gigabyte]]s).<ref name="hadi">{{Cite book |last1=Nian |first1=Lam Pak |title=Handbook of Digital Currency: Bitcoin, Innovation, Financial Instruments, and Big Data |last2=Chuen |first2=David LEE Kuo |publisher=Academic Press |year=2015 |isbn=978-0-12-802351-8 |editor-last=Chuen |editor-first=David LEE Kuo |page=319 |chapter=A Light Touch of Regulation for Virtual Currencies}}</ref> In January 2015, the size had grown to almost 30&nbsp;GB, and from January 2016 to January 2017, the bitcoin blockchain grew from 50&nbsp;GB to 100&nbsp;GB in size.

The words ''block'' and ''chain'' were used separately in Satoshi Nakamoto's original paper, but were eventually popularized as a single word, ''blockchain,'' by 2016.

According to [[Accenture]], an application of the [[diffusion of innovations]] theory suggests that blockchains attained a 13.5% adoption rate within financial services in 2016, therefore reaching the [[early adopter]]s phase.<ref name="tfob">{{Cite news |date=27 June 2016 |title=The future of blockchain in 8 charts |work=Raconteur |url=http://raconteur.net/business/the-future-of-blockchain-in-8-charts |url-status=live |access-date=3 December 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161202234125/http://raconteur.net/business/the-future-of-blockchain-in-8-charts |archive-date=2 December 2016}}</ref> Industry trade groups joined to create the Global Blockchain Forum in 2016, an initiative of the [[Chamber of Digital Commerce]].

[[File:Blockchain.svg|thumb|150px|Blockchain formation. The main chain (black) consists of the longest series of blocks from the genesis block (green) to the current block. Orphan blocks (purple) exist outside of the main chain.]]
A blockchain is a [[Decentralized computing|decentralized]], [[Distributed computing|distributed]], and oftentimes public, digital ledger consisting of records called ''blocks'' that is used to record transactions across many computers so that any involved block cannot be altered retroactively, without the alteration of all subsequent blocks.{{R|te20151031}}<ref name="wired20161107">{{Cite news |last=Armstrong |first=Stephen |date=7 November 2016 |title=Move over Bitcoin, the blockchain is only just getting started |work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |url=https://www.wired.co.uk/article/unlock-the-blockchain |url-status=live |access-date=2016-11-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161108130946/http://www.wired.co.uk/article/unlock-the-blockchain |archive-date=8 November 2016}}</ref> This allows the participants to verify and audit transactions independently and relatively inexpensively.<ref name=":1">{{Cite journal |last1=Catalini |first1=Christian |last2=Gans |first2=Joshua S. |date=23 November 2016 |title=Some Simple Economics of the Blockchain |url=http://www.nber.org/papers/w22952.pdf |url-status=live |doi=10.2139/ssrn.2874598 |ssrn=2874598 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200306014931/https://www.nber.org/papers/w22952.pdf |archive-date=6 March 2020 |access-date=16 September 2019 |s2cid=46904163}}</ref> A blockchain database is managed autonomously using a [[peer-to-peer]] network and a distributed timestamping server.

The use of a blockchain removes the characteristic of infinite [[Reproduction (economics)|reproducibility]] from a digital asset. It confirms that each unit of value was transferred only once, solving the long-standing problem of [[double spending]]. A blockchain has been described as a ''value-exchange protocol''.<ref name="bc2.0">{{Cite magazine |last=Bheemaiah |first=Kariappa |date=January 2015 |title=Block Chain 2.0: The Renaissance of Money |url=https://www.wired.com/insights/2015/01/block-chain-2-0/ |magazine=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161114001509/https://www.wired.com/insights/2015/01/block-chain-2-0/ |archive-date=14 November 2016 |access-date=13 November 2016 |url-status=live}}</ref> A blockchain can maintain [[title (property)|title rights]] because, when properly set up to detail the exchange agreement, it provides a record that compels [[offer and acceptance]].

===Blocks===
Blocks hold batches of valid [[Transaction processing|transactions]] that are hashed and encoded into a [[Merkle tree]].<ref name="te20151031" /> Each block includes the [[cryptographic hash]] of the prior block in the blockchain, linking the two. The linked blocks form a chain.<ref name=te20151031 /> This [[Iteration|iterative]] process confirms the integrity of the previous block, all the way back to the initial block, which is known as the '''''genesis block'''''<!-- bolded per [[WP:MOSBOLD]], as a redirect target -->.<ref name="hadc" />

Sometimes separate blocks can be produced concurrently, creating a temporary [[Fork (software development)|fork]]. In addition to a secure [[Hash-based cryptography|hash-based]] history, any blockchain has a specified algorithm for scoring different versions of the history so that one with a higher score can be selected over others. Blocks not selected for inclusion in the chain are called orphan blocks.<ref name="hadc" /> Peers supporting the database have different versions of the history from time to time. They keep only the highest-scoring version of the database known to them. Whenever a peer receives a higher-scoring version (usually the old version with a single new block added) they extend or overwrite their own database and retransmit the improvement to their peers. There is never an absolute guarantee that any particular entry will remain in the best version of the history forever. Blockchains are typically built to add the score of new blocks onto old blocks and are given incentives to extend with new blocks rather than overwrite old blocks. Therefore, the probability of an entry becoming superseded decreases exponentially<ref name="bsm">{{Cite web |last=Antonopoulos |first=Andreas |date=20 February 2014 |title=Bitcoin security model: trust by computation |url=http://radar.oreilly.com/2014/02/bitcoin-security-model-trust-by-computation.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161031132328/http://radar.oreilly.com/2014/02/bitcoin-security-model-trust-by-computation.html |archive-date=31 October 2016 |access-date=19 November 2016 |website=Radar |publisher=O'Reilly}}</ref> as more blocks are built on top of it, eventually becoming very low.{{R|te20151031}}{{r|t12|p=ch. 08}}{{r|paper}} For example, bitcoin uses a [[proof-of-work system]], where the chain with the most cumulative proof-of-work is considered the valid one by the network.

====Block time====
The ''block time'' is the average time it takes for the network to generate one extra block in the blockchain. Some blockchains create a new block as frequently as every five seconds.{{cn|date=November 2020}} By the time of block completion, the included data becomes verifiable. In cryptocurrency, this is practically when the transaction takes place, so a shorter block time means faster transactions. The block time for [[Ethereum]] is set to between 14 and 15 seconds, while for bitcoin it is on average 10 minutes.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Kumar |first1=Randhir |last2=Tripathi |first2=Rakesh |date=November 2019 |title=Implementation of Distributed File Storage and Access Framework using IPFS and Blockchain |journal=2019 Fifth International Conference on Image Information Processing (ICIIP) |publisher=IEEE |pages=246–251 |doi=10.1109/iciip47207.2019.8985677 |isbn=978-1-7281-0899-5 |s2cid=211119043}}</ref>

==== Hard forks ====
{{Excerpt|Fork (blockchain)|Hard fork}}

=== Decentralization ===
By storing data across its [[Peer-to-peer|peer-to-peer network]], the blockchain eliminates a number of risks that come with data being held centrally.{{R|te20151031}} The decentralized blockchain may use [[ad hoc]] [[message passing]] and [[distributed networking]].

Peer-to-peer blockchain networks lack centralized points of vulnerability that [[Security hacker|computer crackers]] can exploit; likewise, it has no central point of [[failure]]. Blockchain security methods include the use of [[public-key cryptography]].{{r|primer|p=5}} A ''public key'' (a long, random-looking string of numbers) is an address on the blockchain. Value tokens sent across the network are recorded as belonging to that address. A ''private key'' is like a password that gives its owner access to their digital assets or the means to otherwise interact with the various capabilities that blockchains now support. Data stored on the blockchain is generally considered incorruptible.{{R|te20151031}}

Every [[Node (networking)|node]] in a decentralized system has a copy of the blockchain. [[Data quality]] is maintained by massive database [[Replication (computing)|replication]]<ref name="decapp">{{Cite book |last=Raval |first=Siraj |url={{google books|fvywDAAAQBAJ|plainurl =yes}} |title=Decentralized Applications: Harnessing Bitcoin's Blockchain Technology |publisher=O'Reilly Media, Inc. |year=2016 |isbn=978-1-4919-2452-5 |pages=[{{google books|fvywDAAAQBAJ|page =1|plainurl =yes}} 1]–[{{google books |chapter=What Is a Decentralized Application? |oclc=968277125 |access-date=6 November 2016 |chapter-url={{google books|fvywDAAAQBAJ|page =1|plainurl =yes}} |via=Google Books |fvywDAAAQBAJ |plainurl=yes}} 2]}}</ref> and [[computational trust]].

=== Openness ===
Open blockchains are more [[usability|user-friendly]] than some traditional ownership records, which, while open to the public, still require physical access to view. Because all early blockchains were permissionless, controversy has arisen over the blockchain definition. An issue in this ongoing debate is whether a private system with verifiers tasked and authorized (permissioned) by a central authority should be considered a blockchain.{{R|t16|t10|t11|t8|t9}} Proponents of permissioned or private chains argue that the term "blockchain" may be applied to any '''data structure'''<!-- bolded per [[WP:MOSBOLD as a redirect target --> that batches data into time-stamped blocks. These blockchains serve as a distributed version of [[multiversion concurrency control]] (MVCC) in databases.{{R|t4}} Just as MVCC prevents two transactions from concurrently modifying a single object in a database, blockchains prevent two transactions from spending the same single output in a blockchain.<ref name="tapscott201605" />{{rp|30–31}} Opponents say that permissioned systems resemble traditional corporate databases, not supporting decentralized data verification, and that such systems are not hardened against operator tampering and revision.{{R|t16|t11}} Nikolai Hampton of ''[[Computerworld]]'' said that "many in-house blockchain solutions will be nothing more than cumbersome databases," and "without a clear security model, proprietary blockchains should be eyed with suspicion."<ref name=cw20160905/><ref name="MarTech">{{Cite news |last=Barry |first=Levine |date=11 June 2018 |title=A new report bursts the blockchain bubble |publisher=MarTech |url=https://martechtoday.com/a-new-report-bursts-the-blockchain-bubble-216959 |url-status=live |access-date=13 July 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180713232406/https://martechtoday.com/a-new-report-bursts-the-blockchain-bubble-216959 |archive-date=13 July 2018}}</ref>

==== Permissionless ====
The great advantage to an open, permissionless, or public, blockchain network is that guarding against bad actors is not required and no [[access control]] is needed.<ref name="bsm" /> This means that applications can be added to the network without the approval or trust of others, using the blockchain as a [[transport layer]].<ref name="bsm" />

Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies currently secure their blockchain by requiring new entries to include a proof of work. To prolong the blockchain, bitcoin uses [[Hashcash]] puzzles. While Hashcash was designed in 1997 by [[Adam Back]], the original idea was first proposed by [[Cynthia Dwork]] and [[Moni Naor]] and Eli Ponyatovski in their 1992 paper "Pricing via Processing or Combatting Junk Mail".

In 2016, [[venture capital]] investment for blockchain-related projects was weakening in the USA but increasing in China.<ref name="btt17" /> Bitcoin and many other cryptocurrencies use open (public) blockchains. {{asof|2018|04}}, bitcoin has the highest market capitalization.

==== Permissioned (private) blockchain ====

==== Disadvantages of private blockchain====
Nikolai Hampton pointed out in ''[[Computerworld]]'' that "There is also no need for a '51 percent' attack on a private blockchain, as the private blockchain (most likely) already controls 100 percent of all block creation resources. If you could attack or damage the blockchain creation tools on a private corporate server, you could effectively control 100 percent of their network and alter transactions however you wished."<ref name=cw20160905/> This has a set of particularly profound adverse implications during a [[financial crisis]] or [[debt crisis]] like the [[financial crisis of 2007–08]], where politically powerful actors may make decisions that favor some groups at the expense of others,<ref name="SalsmanTheFinancial13">{{Cite web |last=Salsman, R.M. |date=19 September 2013 |title=The Financial Crisis Was A Failure Of Government, Not Free Markets |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/richardsalsman/2013/09/19/the-financial-crisis-was-a-failure-of-government-not-free-markets/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180509081617/https://www.forbes.com/sites/richardsalsman/2013/09/19/the-financial-crisis-was-a-failure-of-government-not-free-markets/ |archive-date=9 May 2018 |access-date=8 May 2018 |website=Forbes}}</ref><ref name="OKeeffeThePolitical15">{{Cite web |last1=O'Keeffe, M. |last2=Terzi, A. |date=7 July 2015 |title=The political economy of financial crisis policy |url=http://bruegel.org/2015/07/the-political-economy-of-financial-crisis-policy/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180519025919/http://bruegel.org/2015/07/the-political-economy-of-financial-crisis-policy/ |archive-date=19 May 2018 |access-date=8 May 2018 |website=Bruegel}}</ref> and "the bitcoin blockchain is protected by the massive group mining effort.

=== Health Care ===

In response to the 2020 [[COVID-19 pandemic]], [[The Wall Street Journal]] reported that [[Ernst & Young]] was working on a blockchain to help employers, governments, airlines and others keep track of people who have had antibody tests and could be immune to the virus. Hospitals and vendors also utilized a blockchain for needed medical equipment. Additionally, blockchain technology was being used in [[China]] to speed up the time it takes for health insurance payments to be paid to health-care providers and patients.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Castellanos |first1=Sara |title=A Cryptocurrency Technology Finds New Use Tackling Coronavirus |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-cryptocurrency-technology-finds-new-use-tackling-coronavirus-11587675966 |website=The Wall Street Journal |accessdate=21 October 2020}}</ref>

=== Domain Names ===
Blockchain [[domain names]] are another use of blockchain on the rise. Unlike regular domain names, blockchain domain names are entirely an asset of the domain owner and can only be controlled by the owner through a private key.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Blockchain Domains: What Are They and How Are They Implemented? {{!}} Hacker Noon |url=https://hackernoon.com/blockchain-domains-what-are-they-and-how-are-they-implemented-hi2b30hu |access-date=2020-04-16 |website=hackernoon.com}}</ref> Blockchain domains pave the way to having sites that are more resistant to [[censorship]] and thus enable freedom of speech as there are no authorities or individuals that can intervene on controlling a domain except the private key holder.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2019-04-22 |title=Unstoppable Domains and the End of Internet Censorship |url=https://hedgetrade.com/unstoppable-domains-ending-internet-censorship/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191106154708/https://hedgetrade.com/unstoppable-domains-ending-internet-censorship/ |archive-date=6 November 2019 |access-date=2020-04-16 |website=HedgeTrade Blog |language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Commentary: Blockchain Could Be the Savior of Free Speech |url=https://fortune.com/2018/07/26/blockchain-technology-cryptocurrency-ethereum-censorship-free-speech/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191227052630/https://fortune.com/2018/07/26/blockchain-technology-cryptocurrency-ethereum-censorship-free-speech/ |archive-date=27 December 2019 |access-date=2020-04-16 |website=Fortune |language=en}}</ref> Again, they are a better option to replace the traditional [[cryptocurrency wallet]] addresses as one can easily memorize the domain and use it for receiving payments.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2020-03-06 |title=.Kred launches as dual DNS and ENS domain |url=https://domainnamewire.com/2020/03/06/kred-blockchain-domain/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200308175635/https://domainnamewire.com/2020/03/06/kred-blockchain-domain/ |archive-date=8 March 2020 |access-date=2020-04-16 |website=Domain Name Wire {{!}} Domain Name News |language=en-US}}</ref>

==Types==
Currently, there are at least four types of blockchain networks — public blockchains, private blockchains, [[consortium]] blockchains and hybrid blockchains.

===Public blockchains===
A public blockchain has absolutely no access restrictions. Anyone with an [[Internet]] connection can send [[Financial transaction|transactions]] to it as well as become a [[validator]] (i.e., participate in the execution of a [[Consensus (computer science)|consensus protocol]]).<ref name="Perfectial">{{Cite web |title=How Companies Can Leverage Private Blockchains to Improve Efficiency and Streamline Business Processes |url=https://perfectial.com/blog/leveraging-private-blockchains-improve-efficiency-streamline-business-processes/ |website=Perfectial}}</ref>{{sps|date=April 2018}} Usually, such networks offer [[Incentive|economic incentives]] for those who secure them and utilize some type of a [[Proof-of-stake|Proof of Stake]] or [[Proof-of-work system|Proof of Work]] algorithm.

Some of the largest, most known public blockchains are the bitcoin blockchain and the Ethereum blockchain.

===Private blockchains===
A private blockchain is permissioned.<ref name="btit" /> One cannot join it unless invited by the network administrators. Participant and validator access is [[Closed platform|restricted]]. To distinguish between open blockchains and other peer-to-peer decentralized database applications that are not open ad-hoc compute clusters, the terminology [[Distributed Ledger]] (DLT) is normally used for private blockchains.

===Hybrid blockchains===
A hybrid blockchain has a combination of centralized and decentralized features.<ref>[Distributed Ledger Technology: Hybrid Approach, Front-to-Back Designing and Changing Trade Processing Infrastructure, By Martin Walker, First published:, 24 OCT 2018 {{ISBN|978-1-78272-389-9}}]</ref> The exact workings of the chain can vary based on which portions of centralization decentralization are used.

===Sidechains===
A sidechain is a designation for a blockchain ledger that runs in parallel to a primary blockchain.<ref name="Raval2016">{{Cite book |last=Siraj Raval |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fvywDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA22 |title=Decentralized Applications: Harnessing Bitcoin's Blockchain Technology |date=18 July 2016 |publisher="O'Reilly Media, Inc." |isbn=978-1-4919-2452-5 |pages=22–}}</ref><ref name="Chowdhury2019">{{Cite book |last=Niaz Chowdhury |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_HatDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA22 |title=Inside Blockchain, Bitcoin, and Cryptocurrencies |date=16 August 2019 |publisher=CRC Press |isbn=978-1-00-050770-6 |pages=22–}}</ref> Entries from the primary blockchain (where said entries typically represent [[digital asset]]s) can be linked to and from the sidechain; this allows the sidechain to otherwise operate independently of the primary blockchain (e.g., by using an alternate means of record keeping, alternate [[Consensus (computer science)|consensus algorithm]], etc.).<ref>{{US patent|10438290}}</ref>


==Interoperability==

With the increasing number of blockchain systems appearing, even only those that support cryptocurrencies, '''blockchain interoperability''' is becoming a topic of major importance. The objective is to support transferring assets from one blockchain system to another blockchain system. Wegner{{R|wegner}} stated that "interoperability is the ability of two or more software components to cooperate despite differences in language, interface, and execution platform". The objective of blockchain interoperability is therefore to support such cooperation among blockchain systems, despite those kinds of differences.

There are already several blockchain interoperability solutions available.{{R|survey}} They can be classified in three categories: cryptocurrency interoperability approaches, blockchain engines, and blockchain connectors.

The IETF has a recent Blockchain-interop working group that already produced the draft of a blockchain interoperability architecture.{{R|ietf-draft}}



==Academic research==
[[File:BlockchainPanelDiscussionAtIEEETechIgnite2017.jpg|thumb|Blockchain panel discussion at the first [[IEEE Computer Society]] TechIgnite conference]]
In October 2014, the MIT Bitcoin Club, with funding from MIT alumni, provided undergraduate students at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] access to $100 of bitcoin. The adoption rates, as studied by Catalini and Tucker (2016), revealed that when people who typically adopt technologies early are given delayed access, they tend to reject the technology.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Catalini |first1=Christian |last2=Tucker |first2=Catherine E. |date=11 August 2016 |title=Seeding the S-Curve?

===Adoption decision===
Motivations for adopting blockchain technology have been investigated by researchers. Janssen et al. provided a framework for analysis.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Janssen |first1=Marijn |last2=Weerakkody |first2=Vishanth |last3=Ismagilova |first3=Elvira |last4=Sivarajah |first4=Uthayasankar |last5=Irani |first5=Zahir |year=2020 |title=A framework for analysing blockchain technology adoption: Integrating institutional, market and technical factors |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0268401219305067 |url-status=live |journal=International Journal of Information Management |publisher=Elsevier |volume=50 |pages=302–309 |doi=10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2019.08.012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200519043940/https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0268401219305067 |archive-date=19 May 2020 |access-date=16 April 2020 |doi-access=free}}</ref> Koens & Poll pointed out that adoption could be heavily driven by non-technical factors.<ref>{{Citation |last1=Koens |first1=Tommy |title=Euro-Par 2018: Parallel Processing Workshops |volume=11339 |pages=535–546 |year=2019 |series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science |chapter=The Drivers Behind Blockchain Adoption: The Rationality of Irrational Choices |doi=10.1007/978-3-030-10549-5_42 |isbn=978-3-030-10548-8 |last2=Poll |first2=Erik}}</ref> Based on behavioral models, Li<ref name="Li2020">Li, Jerry  (2020), "Blockchain technology adoption: Examining the Fundamental Drivers", ''Proceedings of the 2nd International Conference on Management Science and Industrial Engineering'', ACM Publication, April 2020, pp. 253–260. https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3396743.3396750 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200605023137/https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3396743.3396750 |date=5 June 2020 }}</ref> discussed the differences between adoption at individual level and at organization level.

=== Collaboration ===
Scholars in business and management have started studying the role of blockchains to support collaboration.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Hsieh |first1=Ying-Ying |last2=Vergne |first2=Jean-Philippe |last3=Anderson |first3=Philip |last4=Lakhani |first4=Karim |last5=Reitzig |first5=Markus |date=2019-02-12 |title=Correction to: Bitcoin and the rise of decentralized autonomous organizations |journal=Journal of Organization Design |volume=8 |issue=1 |pages=3 |doi=10.1186/s41469-019-0041-1 |issn=2245-408X |doi-access=free}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Felin |first1=Teppo |last2=Lakhani |first2=Karim |year=2018 |title=What Problems Will You Solve With Blockchain? |journal=MIT Sloan Management Review}}</ref> It has been argued that blockchains can foster both cooperation (i.e., prevention of opportunistic behavior) and coordination (i.e., communication and information sharing). Thanks to reliability, transparency, traceability of records, and information immutability, blockchains facilitate collaboration in a way that differs both from the traditional use of contracts and from relational norms.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Lumineau |first1=Fabrice |last2=Wang |first2=Wenqian |last3=Schilke |first3=Oliver |year=2020 |title=Blockchain Governance—A New Way of Organizing Collaborations? |journal=Organization Science|doi=10.1287/orsc.2020.1379 }}</ref> Contrary to contracts, blockchains do not directly rely on the legal system to enforce agreements. In addition, contrary to the use of relational norms, blockchains do not require trust or direct connections between collaborators.

The need for internal audit to provide effective oversight of organizational efficiency will require a change in the way that  information  is accessed in new formats.<ref>Hugh Rooney, Brian Aiken, & Megan Rooney. (2017). Q&A. Is Internal Audit Ready for Blockchain?
