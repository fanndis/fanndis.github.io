The '''United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit''' (in [[case citation]]s, '''D.C. Cir.''') is one of the thirteen [[United States Courts of Appeals]]. It has the smallest geographical jurisdiction of any of the U.S. federal appellate courts, and covers only one district court: the [[United States District Court for the District of Columbia|U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia]].{{efn|In some circumstances, it may also handle appeals that originate in [[American Samoa]], which has no local federal district court or [[United States territorial court|territorial court]], by way of the D.C. District court; the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|Ninth Circuit]] may also handle such cases by the [[United States District Court for the District of Hawaii|District of Hawaii]].<ref name="GAO_AS">https://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-08-1124T GAO (U.S. Government Accountability Office. AMERICAN SAMOA: Issues Associated with Some Federal Court Options. September 18, 2008. Retrieved September 7, 2019.</ref>}} It meets at the [[E. Barrett Prettyman United States Courthouse]], near [[Judiciary Square, Washington, D.C.]]

The D.C. Circuit's prominence and prestige among American courts is second only to the [[United States Supreme Court|U.S. Supreme Court]] because its jurisdiction contains the [[U.S. Congress]] and many [[Independent agencies of the United States government|U.S. government agencies]], and therefore it is the main appellate court for many issues of American [[administrative law]] and [[United States constitutional law|constitutional law]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Turner |first1=Julia |title=Explainer: What’s So Important About the Washington, D.C., Circuit Court of Appeals? |url=https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2003/02/the-second-highest-court-in-the-land.html |website=Slate Magazine |accessdate=24 July 2019 |language=en |date=7 February 2003}}</ref>  Three of the current nine justices on the Supreme Court were previously judges on the D.C. Circuit: [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] [[John Roberts]] and [[Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court|Associate Justices]] [[Clarence Thomas]] and [[Brett Kavanaugh]]. Former justices [[Fred M. Vinson]], [[Wiley Blount Rutledge]], [[Warren E. Burger]], [[Antonin Scalia]], and [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]] also served as judges on the D.C. Circuit before their appointments to the Supreme Court.

Because the D.C. Circuit does not represent any state, confirmation of nominees can be procedurally and practically easier than for nominees to the Courts of Appeals for the other geographical districts, as home-state senators have historically been able to hold up confirmation through the "[[blue slip#Senate|blue slip]]" process. However, in recent years, several nominees to the D.C. Circuit were stalled, and some were ultimately not confirmed because senators claimed that the court had become larger than necessary to handle its caseload.

When Congress established this court in 1893 as the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia, it had a Chief Justice, and the other judges were called Associate Justices, which was similar to the structure of the Supreme Court. The Chief Justiceship was a separate seat: the President would appoint the Chief Justice, and that person would stay Chief Justice until he left the court.

On June 25, 1948, 62 ''Stat.'' 869 and 62 ''Stat.'' 985 became law. These acts made the Chief Justice a Chief Judge. In 1954, another law, 68 ''Stat.'' 1245, clarified what was implicit in those laws: that the Chief Judgeship was not a mere renaming of the position but a change in its status that made it the same as the Chief Judge of other inferior courts.

{{ChiefJudge}}

== Succession of seats ==

The court has eleven seats for active judges after the elimination of seat seven under the Court Security Improvement Act of 2007. The seat that was originally the Chief Justiceship is numbered as Seat 1; the other seats are numbered in order of their creation. If seats were established simultaneously, they are numbered in the order in which they were filled. Judges who retire into [[senior status]] remain on the bench but leave their seat vacant. That seat is filled by the next circuit judge appointed by the [[President of the United States|President]].
