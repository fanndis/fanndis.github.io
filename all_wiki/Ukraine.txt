'''Ukraine''' ({{lang-uk|Україна|Ukrayina}}, {{IPA-uk|ʊkrɐˈjinɐ|pron|Uk-Україна (2).oga}}; {{lang-rus|Украина|Ukraina|ʊkrɐˈinə}}) is a country in [[Eastern Europe]]. It is bordered by [[Russia]] to the  east and north-east; [[Belarus]] to the north; [[Poland]], [[Slovakia]] and [[Hungary]] to the west; and [[Romania]], [[Moldova]], and the [[Black Sea]] to the south. Ukraine also borders [[Crimea]] to its south, which [[Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation|Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014]], though Ukraine [[territorial dispute|still continues to claim the territory]]. Including Crimea, Ukraine has an area of {{convert|603628|km²|0|abbr=on}}, making it the [[List of European countries by area|second-largest country by area]] in Europe after Russia, and the [[List of countries and dependencies by area|46th-largest country]] in the world. Excluding Crimea, Ukraine has a population of about 42 million, making it the [[List of European countries by population|eighth-most populous country]] in Europe, and the [[List of countries and dependencies by population|34th-most populous country]] in the world. Its capital and largest city is [[Kyiv]].<!--See [[Talk:Kiev/naming]] re Kiev/Kyiv. -->

The territory of modern Ukraine has been inhabited since 32,000 BC. During the [[Middle Ages]], the area was a key centre of [[East Slavs|East Slavic]] culture, with the powerful state of [[Kyivan Rus']] forming the basis of Ukrainian identity. Following its fragmentation in the 13th century, the territory was contested, ruled and divided by a variety of powers, including the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]], [[Austria-Hungary]], the [[Ottoman Empire]] and Russia. A [[Cossack Hetmanate|Cossack republic]] emerged and prospered during the 17th and 18th centuries, but its territory was eventually split between [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth|Poland]] and the [[Russian Empire]]. In the aftermath of the [[Russian Revolution]], a Ukrainian national movement for self-determination emerged and the internationally recognized [[Ukrainian People's Republic]] was declared on 23 June 1917. After [[World War II]] the western part of Ukraine merged into the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic]], and the whole country became a part of the [[Soviet Union]]. Ukraine gained its independence in 1991, following the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]].

Following its independence, Ukraine declared itself a [[neutral state]];<ref name="gska2.rada.gov.ua">{{cite web |url=http://gska2.rada.gov.ua:7777/site/postanova_eng/Declaration_of_State_Sovereignty_of_Ukraine_rev1.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927224650/http://gska2.rada.gov.ua:7777/site/postanova_eng/Declaration_of_State_Sovereignty_of_Ukraine_rev1.htm |archive-date=27 September 2007 |title=Declaration of State Sovereignty of Ukraine |access-date=24 December 2007 |website=[[Verkhovna Rada]] of Ukraine}}</ref> it formed a limited military partnership with Russia and other [[Commonwealth of Independent States|CIS countries]] while also establishing a [[Partnership for Peace|partnership with NATO]] in 1994. In 2013, after the government of President [[Viktor Yanukovych]] had decided to suspend the [[Ukraine–European Union Association Agreement]] and seek closer economic ties with Russia, a several-months-long wave of demonstrations and protests known as the [[Euromaidan]] began, which later escalated into the [[2014 Ukrainian revolution]] that led to the overthrow of Yanukovych and the establishment of a new government. These events formed the background for the [[annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation|annexation of Crimea by Russia]] in March 2014, and the [[War in Donbass]] in April 2014.

Beginning in the sixth century BC, colonies of [[Ancient Greece]], [[Ancient Rome]], and the [[Byzantine Empire]], such as [[Tyras]], [[Olbia, Ukraine|Olbia]], and [[Chersonesus]], were founded on the northeastern shore of the [[Black Sea]]. These colonies thrived well into the sixth&nbsp;century AD. The [[Goths]] stayed in the area, but came under the sway of the [[Huns]] from the 370s AD. In the seventh&nbsp;century AD, the territory that is now eastern Ukraine was the centre of [[Old Great Bulgaria]].

In the fifth and sixth centuries, the [[Antes (people)|Antes]] were located in the territory of what is now Ukraine. The Antes were the ancestors of [[Ukrainians]]: [[White Croats]], [[Severians]], [[Polans (eastern)|Polans]], [[Drevlyans]], [[Dulebes]], [[Ulichians]], and [[Tiverians]]. Migrations from Ukraine throughout the [[Balkans]] established many [[Southern Slavs|Southern Slavic]] nations. Northern migrations, reaching almost to the [[Lake Ilmen|Ilmen]] lakes, led to the emergence of the [[Ilmen Slavs]], [[Krivichs]], and [[Radimichs]], the groups ancestral to the [[Russians]]. After an Avar raid in 602 and the collapse of the Antes Union, most of these peoples survived as separate tribes until the beginning of the second millennium.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t124cP06gg0C&q=antes+avar&pg=PA42 |title=A History of Ukraine |first=Paul Robert |last=Magocsi |date=16 July 1996 |publisher=[[University of Toronto Press]] |access-date=16 July 2018 |via=Google Books |isbn=9780802078209}}</ref>

In the mid-14th&nbsp;century, upon the death of [[Bolesław Jerzy II of Mazovia]], king [[Casimir III of Poland]] initiated campaigns (1340–1366) to take Galicia-Volhynia. Meanwhile, the heartland of Rus', including Kyiv, became the territory of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, ruled by [[Gediminas]] and his successors, after the [[Battle on the Irpen' River]]. Following the 1386 [[Union of Krewo]], a [[dynastic union]] between Poland and Lithuania, much of what became northern Ukraine was ruled by the increasingly Slavicised local Lithuanian nobles as part of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. By 1392 the so-called [[Galicia–Volhynia Wars]] ended. Polish colonisers of depopulated lands in northern and central Ukraine founded or re-founded many towns. 

In the Black sea cities of modern-day Ukraine, the [[Republic of Genoa]] founded numerous colonies, from the mid-13th century to the late 15th century, including the cities of [[Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi]] ("Moncastro") and [[Kiliya]] ("Licostomo"), the colonies used to be large commercial centers in the region, and were headed by a consul (a representative of the Republic).<ref>{{Cite web|date=2018-02-05|title=Генуэзские колонии в Одесской области - Бизнес-портал Измаила|url=http://izm-biz.info/genuezskie-kolonii-v-odesskoj-oblasti/|access-date=2020-11-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180205001115/http://izm-biz.info/genuezskie-kolonii-v-odesskoj-oblasti/|archive-date=5 February 2018}}</ref>

=== Cossack Hetmanate ===

Khmelnytsky, deserted by his Tatar allies, suffered a crushing deafeat at the [[Battle of Berestechko]] in 1651, and turned to the Russian tsar for help. In 1654, Khmelnytsky was subject to the [[Pereyaslav Council]], forming a military and political alliance with Russia that acknowledged loyalty to the Russian tsar.

In 1657–1686 came "[[The Ruin (Ukrainian history)|The Ruin]]", a devastating 30-year war amongst Russia, Poland, the [[Crimean Khanate]], the [[Ottoman Empire]], and [[Cossacks]] for control of Ukraine, which occurred at about the same time as the [[Deluge (history)|Deluge]] of Poland. The wars escalated in intensity with hundreds of thousands of deaths. The "[[Treaty of Perpetual Peace (1686)|Treaty of Perpetual Peace]]" between Russia and Poland in 1686 divided the lands of the Cossack Hetmanate between them, reducing the portion over which Poland had claimed sovereignty.

In 1709, Cossack Hetman [[Ivan Mazepa]] (1639–1709) defected to [[Sweden]] against Russia in the [[Great Northern War]] (1700–1721). Eventually Tsar [[Peter the Great|Peter]] recognized that to consolidate and modernize Russia's political and economic power it was necessary to do away with the Cossack Hetmanate and Ukrainian and Cossack aspirations to autonomy. Mazepa died in exile after fleeing from the [[Battle of Poltava]] (1709), in which the Swedes and their Cossack allies suffered a catastrophic defeat.

The [[Constitution of Pylyp Orlyk]] or Pacts and Constitutions of Rights and Freedoms of the Zaporizhian Host was a 1710 constitutional document written by [[Hetman]] [[Pylyp Orlyk]], a Cossack of Ukraine, then within the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20100407082709/http://www.kyivpost.com/news/nation/detail/63202/ "300th anniversary of first Ukrainian constitution written by Pylyp Orlyk being celebrated"], ''[[Kyiv Post]]'', (5 April 2010)</ref> It established a standard for the [[separation of powers]] in government between the legislative, executive, and judiciary branches, well before the publication of [[Montesquieu]]'s ''[[The Spirit of the Laws]]''.

The [[Constitution of Pylyp Orlyk]] was unique for its period, and was one of the first state constitutions in Europe.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

The hetmanate was abolished in 1764; the [[Zaporozhian Sich]] was abolished in 1775, as Russia centralised control over its lands. As part of the [[Partitions of Poland]] in 1772, 1793 and 1795, the Ukrainian lands west of the Dnieper were divided between Russia and Austria. From 1737 to 1834, expansion into the northern Black Sea littoral and the eastern [[Danube]] valley was a cornerstone of Russian foreign policy.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

Lithuanians and Poles controlled vast estates in Ukraine, and were a law unto themselves. Judicial rulings from [[Kraków]] were routinely flouted, while peasants were heavily taxed and practically tied to the land as [[serfdom|serfs]]. Occasionally the landowners battled each other using armies of Ukrainian peasants. The Poles and Lithuanians were Roman Catholics and tried with some success to convert the Orthodox lesser nobility. In 1596, they set up the "Greek-Catholic" or [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church|Uniate Church]]; it dominates western Ukraine to this day. Religious differentiation left the Ukrainian Orthodox peasants leaderless, as they were reluctant to follow the Ukrainian nobles.<ref>Reid (2000) p 27–30</ref>

Cossacks led an uprising, called [[Koliyivshchyna]], starting in the Ukrainian borderlands of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1768. Ethnicity was one root cause of this revolt, which included the [[Massacre of Uman]] that killed tens of thousands of Poles and Jews. Religious warfare also broke out among Ukrainian groups. Increasing conflict between Uniate and Orthodox parishes along the newly reinforced Polish-Russian border on the [[Dnieper]] in the time of [[Catherine the Great]] set the stage for the uprising. As Uniate religious practices had become more Latinized, Orthodoxy in this region drew even closer into dependence on the [[Russian Orthodox Church]]. Confessional tensions also reflected opposing Polish and Russian political allegiances.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Skinner |first1=Barbara |year=2005 |title=Borderlands of Faith: Reconsidering the Origins of a Ukrainian Tragedy |journal=Slavic Review |volume=64 |issue=1 |pages=88–116 |doi=10.2307/3650068|jstor=3650068}}</ref>

World War I destroyed both empires. The [[Russian Revolution of 1917]] led to the founding of the Soviet Union under the [[Bolshevik]]s, and subsequent [[civil war in Russia]]. A Ukrainian national movement for self-determination emerged, with heavy Communist and Socialist influence. Several Ukrainian states briefly emerged: the internationally recognized [[Ukrainian People's Republic]] (''UNR'', the predecessor of modern Ukraine, was declared on 23 June 1917 proclaimed at first as a part of the Russian Republic; after the [[Bolshevik Revolution]], the Ukrainian People's Republic proclaimed its independence on 25 January 1918), the [[Ukrainian State|Hetmanate]], the [[Directorate of Ukraine|Directorate]] and the pro-Bolshevik [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic]] (or Soviet Ukraine) successively established territories in the former Russian Empire; while the [[West Ukrainian People's Republic]] and the [[Hutsul Republic]] emerged briefly in the Ukrainian lands of former Austro-Hungarian territory.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://riowang.blogspot.com/2014/05/the-hutsul-republic.html|title=The Hutsul Republic}}</ref>

The short lived [[Act Zluky]] (Unification Act) was an agreement signed on 22 January 1919 by the [[Ukrainian People's Republic]] and the [[West Ukrainian People's Republic]] on the [[Saint Sophia Cathedral in Kyiv|St. Sophia Square]] in [[Kyiv]].<ref name="Basilevsky2016">{{cite book|author=Alexander Basilevsky|title=Early Ukraine: A Military and Social History to the Mid–19th Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oa_uCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA9 |date=2016|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-9714-0|pages=9–}}</ref> This led to civil war, and an [[Anarchism|anarchist]] movement called the [[Black Guards|Black Army]] (later renamed to [[The Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine]]) developed in Southern Ukraine under the command of the anarchist [[Nestor Makhno]] during the [[Russian Civil War]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?linkPath=pages\M\A\MakhnoNestor.htm |title=Makhno, Nestor |author=Cipko, Serge |access-date=17 January 2008 |website=Encyclopedia of Ukraine}}</ref> They protected the operation of "[[Soviet (council)|free soviets]]" and [[libertarian socialism|libertarian]] [[communes]] in the [[Free Territory]], an attempt to form a [[Stateless society|stateless]] [[Anarchism|anarchist]] society from 1918 to 1921 during the [[Ukrainian War of Independence|Ukrainian Revolution]], fighting both the tsarist [[Armed Forces of South Russia|White Army]] under [[Anton Denikin|Denikin]] and later the [[Red Army]] under [[Leon Trotsky|Trotsky]], before being defeated by the latter in August 1921.

Poland defeated Western Ukraine in the [[Polish-Ukrainian War]], but failed against the Bolsheviks in [[Kyiv Offensive (1920)|an offensive against Kyiv]]. According to the [[Peace of Riga]], western Ukraine was incorporated into Poland, which in turn recognised the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic in March 1919. With establishment of the Soviet power, Ukraine lost half of its territory, while Moldavian autonomy was established on the left bank of the [[Dniester]] River.

The war in Ukraine continued for another two years; by 1921, however, most of Ukraine had been taken over by the Soviet Union, while Galicia and Volhynia (mostly today's [[West Ukraine]]) were incorporated into the [[Second Polish Republic]]. Modern-day [[Bukovina]] was annexed by Romania and [[Carpathian Ruthenia]] was admitted to the [[First Czechoslovak Republic|Czechoslovak Republic]] as an autonomy.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Ukraine|title=Ukraine - World War I and the struggle for independence|website=Encyclopedia Britannica}}</ref>

A powerful underground Ukrainian nationalist movement arose in eastern Poland in the 1920s and 1930s, which was formed by Ukrainian veterans of the [[Ukrainian-Soviet war]] (including [[Yevhen Konovalets]], [[Andriy Atanasovych Melnyk|Andriy Melnyk]], and [[Yuriy Tyutyunyk]]) and was transformed into the [[Ukrainian Military Organization]] and later the [[Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists|Organisation of Ukrainian Nationalists (OUN)]]. The movement attracted a militant following among students. Hostilities between Polish state authorities and the popular movement led to a substantial number of fatalities, and the autonomy which had been promised was never implemented. The pre-war Polish government also exercised [[anti-Ukrainian sentiment]]; it restricted rights of people who declared Ukrainian nationality, belonged to the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] and inhabited the [[Eastern Borderlands]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=imswAAAAIAAJ&q=ukrainophobia+poland|title=Polish Atrocities in Ukraine|first=Emil|last=Revyuk|date=8 July 1931|publisher=Svoboda Press|via=Google Books}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Wp1R2srxDGEC&q=ukrainophobia+poland&pg=PA54|title=For East is East: Liber Amicorum Wojciech Skalmowski|first=Wojciech|last=Skalmowski|date=8 July 2003|publisher=Peeters Publishers|via=Google Books|isbn=9789042912984}}</ref> The [[Ukrainian language]] was restricted in every field possible, especially in governmental institutions, and the term "Ruthenian" was enforced in an attempt to ban the use of the term "Ukrainian".<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l6IlAAAAMAAJ&q=ukrainophobia+poland+rights|title=The Communist Party of Western Ukraine, 1919-1929|first1=Janusz|last1=Radziejowski|first2=University of Alberta Canadian Institute of Ukrainian|last2=Studies|date=8 July 1983|publisher=Canadian Institute of Ukrainian Studies, University of Alberta|via=Google Books|isbn=9780920862254}}</ref> Despite this, a number of Ukrainian parties, the Ukrainian Catholic Church, an active press, and a business sector existed in Poland.

Largely the same groups were responsible for the mass killing operations during the civil war, collectivisation, and the [[Great Purge|Great Terror]]. These groups were associated with [[Yefim Yevdokimov]] (1891–1939) and operated in the Secret Operational Division within General State Political Administration ([[State Political Directorate|OGPU]]) in 1929–31. Yevdokimov transferred into Communist Party administration in 1934, when he became Party secretary for [[North Caucasus Krai]].

Following the death of [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] in 1953, [[Nikita Khrushchev]] became the new leader of the USSR. Having served as First Secretary of the [[Communist Party (Bolsheviks) of Ukraine|Communist Party of Ukrainian SSR]] in 1938–49, Khrushchev was intimately familiar with the republic; after taking power union-wide, he began to emphasize "the friendship" between the Ukrainian and Russian nations. In 1954, the 300th anniversary of the [[Treaty of Pereyaslav]] was widely celebrated. [[Crimean Oblast|Crimea]] was [[1954 transfer of Crimea|transferred]] from the [[Russian SFSR]] to the [[Ukrainian SSR]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iccrimea.org/historical/crimeatransfer.html |title=The Transfer of Crimea to Ukraine |access-date=25 March 2007 |date=July 2005 |website=International Committee for Crimea}}</ref>

By 1950, the republic had fully surpassed pre-war levels of industry and production.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-30084/Ukraine |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080115052626/http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-30084/Ukraine |archive-date=15 January 2008 |title=Ukraine – The last years of Stalin's rule |access-date=28 December 2007 |website=Encyclopædia Britannica (fee required) |url-status=dead}}</ref> During the 1946–1950 [[Five-Year Plan (USSR)|five-year plan]], nearly 20% of the Soviet budget was invested in Soviet Ukraine, a 5% increase from pre-war plans. As a result, the Ukrainian workforce rose 33.2% from 1940 to 1955 while industrial output grew 2.2 times in that same period.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

Soviet Ukraine soon became a European leader in industrial production,<ref>Magocsi, p. 644</ref> and an important centre of the Soviet [[arms industry]] and high-tech research. Such an important role resulted in a major influence of the local elite. Many members of the Soviet leadership came from Ukraine, most notably [[Leonid Brezhnev]]. He later ousted Khrushchev and became the Soviet leader from 1964 to 1982. Many prominent Soviet sports players, scientists, and artists came from Ukraine.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

To the southwest, the [[Danube Delta|delta]] of the [[Danube]] forms the border with Romania. Ukraine's various regions have diverse geographic features ranging from the highlands to the lowlands. The country's only mountains are the [[Carpathian Mountains]] in the west, of which the highest is the [[Hora Hoverla]] at {{convert|2061|m}}, and the [[Crimean Mountains]] on Crimea, in the extreme south along the coast.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-30093/Ukraine |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080115052701/http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-30093/Ukraine |archive-date=15 January 2008 |title=Ukraine – Relief |access-date=27 December 2007 |website=Encyclopædia Britannica (fee required) |url-status=dead}}</ref> However Ukraine also has a number of highland regions such as the [[Volhynian-Podolian Upland|Volyn-Podillia Upland]] (in the west) and the Near-Dnipro Upland (on the right bank of Dnieper); to the east there are the south-western spurs of the [[Central Russian Upland]] over which runs the border with the Russian Federation. Near the [[Sea of Azov]] can be found the Donets Ridge and the Near Azov Upland. The [[snow melt]] from the mountains feeds the rivers, and natural changes in altitude form sudden drops in elevation and give rise to [[waterfalls of Ukraine|waterfalls]].

Significant natural resources in Ukraine include iron ore, coal, manganese, natural gas, oil, salt, sulphur, graphite, titanium, magnesium, kaolin, nickel, mercury, timber and an abundance of arable land. Despite this, the country faces a number of major environmental issues such as inadequate supplies of potable water; air- and water-pollution and deforestation, as well as radiation contamination in the north-east from the [[Chernobyl disaster|1986 accident at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant]]. [[Hazardous Waste Recycling|Recycling toxic household waste]] is still in its infancy in Ukraine.<ref>{{cite news |author=Oksana Grytsenko |url=http://www.kyivpost.com/news/nation/detail/118498/ |title=Environment suffers from lack of recycling |newspaper=[[Kyiv Post]] |date=9 December 2011|url-status= dead|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120105012539/http://www.kyivpost.com/news/nation/detail/118498/ |archive-date=5 January 2012}}</ref>

=== Soil ===
[[File:Кінбурнська коса восени.jpg|thumb|right|[[Kinburn Spit|Kinburn sandbar]], [[Ochakiv]] Raion, [[Mykolaiv Oblast]]]]
From northwest to southeast the soils of Ukraine may be divided into three major aggregations:<ref name="britannica.com">{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/place/Ukraine |title=Ukraine |website=Encyclopædia Britannica}}</ref>
[[File:Поля під Касовою горою.jpg|thumb|Agricultural works in [[Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast]]]]
* a zone of sandy [[podzol]]ized soils
* a central belt consisting of the extremely fertile Ukrainian black earth ([[Chornozem|chernozems]])
* a zone of chestnut and [[soil salinity|salinized soils]]

As much as two-thirds of the country's surface land consists of the so-called black earth, a resource that has made Ukraine one of the most fertile regions in the world and well known as a "breadbasket".<ref>Magocsi, Paul R. ''A history of Ukraine: The land and its peoples''. University of Toronto Press, 2010.</ref> These soils may be divided into three broad groups:

* in the north a belt of the so-called deep chernozems, about {{convert|5|ft|m|abbr=off}} thick and rich in humus
* south and east of the former, a zone of prairie, or ordinary, chernozems, which are equally rich in humus but only about {{convert|3|ft|m|abbr=off}} thick
* the southernmost belt, which is even thinner and has still less humus

Interspersed in various uplands and along the northern and western perimeters of the deep chernozems are mixtures of gray forest soils and podzolized black-earth soils, which together occupy much of Ukraine's remaining area. All these soils are very fertile when sufficient water is available. However, their intensive cultivation, especially on steep slopes, has led to widespread soil erosion and gullying.

The smallest proportion of the soil cover consists of the chestnut soils of the southern and eastern regions. They become increasingly salinized to the south as they approach the Black Sea.<ref name="britannica.com" />

Ukraine falls into two main zoological areas. One of these areas, in the west of the country, is made up of the borderlands of Europe, where there are species typical of mixed forests, the other is located in eastern Ukraine, where steppe-dwelling species thrive. In the forested areas of the country it is not uncommon to find lynxes, wolves, wild boar and martens, as well as many other similar species; this is especially true of the [[Carpathian Mountains]], where many predatory mammals make their home, as well as a contingent of brown bears. Around Ukraine's lakes and rivers beavers, otters and mink make their home, whilst in the waters carp, bream and catfish are the most commonly found species of fish. In the central and eastern parts of the country, rodents such as hamsters and gophers are found in large numbers.

==== Fungi ====
More than 6,600 [[species]] of [[Fungus|fungi]] (including [[lichen]]-forming species) have been recorded from Ukraine,<ref>D.W. Minter and Dudka, I.O. "Fungi of Ukraine – a preliminary checklist".

The true total number of fungal species occurring in Ukraine, including species not yet recorded, is likely to be far higher, given the generally accepted estimate that only about 7% of all fungi worldwide have so far been discovered.<ref>Kirk, P.M., Cannon, P.F., Minter, D.W. and Stalpers, J. "Dictionary of the Fungi". Edn 10. CABI, 2008</ref> Although the amount of available information is still very small, a first effort has been made to estimate the number of fungal species endemic to Ukraine, and 2217 such species have been tentatively identified.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cybertruffle.org.uk/ukrafung/eng/endelist.htm |title=Fungi of Ukraine – potential endemics |publisher=cybertruffle.org.uk |access-date=13 July 2011}}</ref>

With the proclamation of its independence on 24 August 1991, and adoption of a constitution on 28 June 1996, Ukraine became a semi-presidential republic. However, in 2004, deputies introduced changes to the Constitution, which tipped the balance of power in favour of a [[parliamentary system]]. From 2004 to 2010, the legitimacy of the 2004 Constitutional amendments had official sanction, both with the Constitutional Court of Ukraine, and most major political parties.<ref name="1oct">{{cite web |author=Віталій Портников |url=http://www.radiosvoboda.org/content/article/2174109.html |title=Vitaly Portnykov. "Comment on the Constitutional Court of Ukraine on elimination of political reform in 2004 for Radio Liberty asked Nicholas Onischuk, former Justice Minister&nbsp;... 25 February 2008 the Constitutional Court came to the conclusion that this bill can not be subject to constitutional control, but now we see that the Constitutional Court concluded that it can". 1 October 2010 |publisher=Radiosvoboda.org |access-date=31 October 2011}}</ref> Despite this, on 30 September 2010 the Constitutional Court ruled that the amendments were null and void, forcing a return to the terms of the 1996 Constitution and again making Ukraine's political system more presidential in character.

The ruling on the 2004 Constitutional amendments became a major topic of political discourse. Much of the concern was based on the fact that neither the Constitution of 1996 nor the Constitution of 2004 provided the ability to "undo the Constitution", as the decision of the Constitutional Court would have it, even though the 2004 constitution arguably has an exhaustive list of possible procedures for constitutional amendments (articles 154–159). In any case, the current Constitution could be modified by a vote in Parliament.<ref name="1oct" /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tymoshenko.ua/en/article/3o3zxoz9 |title=Yulia Tymoshenko: October 1 marks the end of Ukraine's democracy and beginning of dictatorship |publisher=Tymoshenko.ua |date=1 October 2010 |access-date=31 October 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111009163812/http://www.tymoshenko.ua/en/article/3o3zxoz9 |archive-date=9 October 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first=Serhiy |last=Hrabovsky |url=http://www.radiosvoboda.org/content/article/2174129.html|script-title=uk:Судові абсурди, або Котляревський знову сміється|trans-title=Judicial absurdities, or Kotliarevsky is laughing again |language=uk |publisher=radiosvoboda.org |date=1 October 2010 |access-date=6 April 2016 |quote=(Translation) These words handed down on the decision of the Constitutional Court of Ukraine (CCU) regarding cancelling the political reforms of 2004 are worthy of being inscribed in the annals of world jurisprudence.

On 21 February 2014 an agreement between President Viktor Yanukovych and opposition leaders saw the country return to the 2004 Constitution. The historic agreement, brokered by the [[European Union]], followed protests that began in late November 2013 and culminated in a week of violent clashes in which scores of protesters were killed. In addition to returning the country to the 2004 Constitution, the deal provided for the formation of a coalition government, the calling of early elections, and the release of former Prime Minister [[Yulia Tymoshenko]] from prison.<ref name="Ukraine2014protests">{{cite news |title=President Yanukovych and Ukraine opposition sign early poll deal |url=http://www.europesun.com/index.php/sid/220190358 |date=21 February 2014 |work=europesun.com |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140228115026/http://www.europesun.com/index.php/sid/220190358 |archive-date=28 February 2014}}</ref> A day after the agreement was reached the Ukraine parliament dismissed Yanukovych and installed its speaker [[Oleksandr Turchynov]] as interim president<ref name="UkrainePresidentReplaced">{{cite news |title=Ukraine: Speaker Oleksandr Turchynov named interim president |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-26312008 |work=BBC News |location=Kyiv |date=23 February 2014 |access-date=6 April 2016}}</ref> and [[Arseniy Yatsenyuk]] as the [[Prime Minister of Ukraine]].<ref>{{cite news |first=Harriet |last=Salem |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/04/who-governing-ukraine-olexander-turchynov |title=Who exactly is governing Ukraine? |newspaper=The Guardian |date=4 March 2014 |access-date=6 April 2016}}</ref>

Laws, acts of the parliament and the cabinet, presidential decrees, and acts of the [[Verkhovna Rada of Crimea|Crimean parliament]] may be abrogated by the [[Constitutional Court of Ukraine|Constitutional Court]], should they be found to violate the constitution. Other normative acts are subject to judicial review. The [[Supreme Court of Ukraine|Supreme Court]] is the main body in the system of courts of general jurisdiction.
Local self-government is officially guaranteed. Local councils and city mayors are popularly elected and exercise control over local budgets. The heads of regional and district administrations are appointed by the President in accordance with the proposals of the Prime Minister. This system virtually requires an agreement between the President and the Prime Minister, and has in the past led to problems, such as when President Yushchenko exploited a perceived loophole by appointing so-called 'temporarily acting' officers, instead of actual governors or local leaders, thus evading the need to seek a compromise with the Prime Minister. This practice was controversial and was subject to Constitutional Court review.

Ukraine has many political parties, many of which have tiny memberships and are unknown to the general public.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} Small parties often join in multi-party coalitions (electoral blocs) for the purpose of participating in parliamentary elections.

=== Courts and law enforcement ===

The courts enjoy legal, financial and constitutional freedom guaranteed by Ukrainian law since 2002. Judges are largely well protected from dismissal (except in the instance of gross misconduct). Court justices are appointed by presidential decree for an initial period of five years, after which Ukraine's Supreme Council confirms their positions for life. Although there are still problems, the system is considered to have been much improved since Ukraine's independence in 1991. The Supreme Court is regarded as an independent and impartial body, and has on several occasions ruled against the Ukrainian government. The [[World Justice Project]] ranks Ukraine 66 out of 99 countries surveyed in its annual Rule of Law Index.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://data.worldjusticeproject.org/#/index/UKR|title=WJP Rule of Law Index® 2018-2019|website=data.worldjusticeproject.org}}</ref>

=== Foreign relations ===
{{Main|Foreign relations of Ukraine|International membership of Ukraine|Ukraine–European Union relations|The World Bank in Ukraine}}
In 1999–2001, Ukraine served as a non-permanent member of the [[UN Security Council]]. Historically, Soviet Ukraine joined the United Nations in 1945 as one of the original members following a Western compromise with the Soviet Union, which had asked for seats for all 15 of its union republics. Ukraine has consistently supported peaceful, negotiated settlements to disputes. It has participated in the quadripartite talks on the conflict in Moldova and promoted a peaceful resolution to conflict in the post-Soviet state of Georgia. Ukraine also has made a substantial contribution to UN [[peacekeeping]] operations since 1992.

The European Union (EU) has encouraged Ukraine to implement the PCA fully before discussions begin on an association agreement, issued at the EU Summit in December 1999 in [[Helsinki]], recognizes Ukraine's long-term aspirations but does not discuss association. On 31 January 1992, Ukraine joined the then-Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (now the [[Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe]] (OSCE)), and on 10 March 1992, it became a member of the [[North Atlantic Cooperation Council]].

=== Administrative divisions ===

{{Further|Political status of Crimea and Sevastopol|Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation}}
The system of Ukrainian subdivisions reflects the country's status as a [[unitary state]] (as stated in the country's constitution) with unified legal and [[Local government|administrative]] regimes for each unit.

Including Sevastopol and the Autonomous Republic of Crimea that were annexed by the Russian Federation in 2014, Ukraine consists of 27 regions: twenty-four [[oblast]]s (provinces), one [[autonomous republic]] ([[Autonomous Republic of Crimea]]), and two cities of special status – [[Kyiv]], the capital, and [[Sevastopol]]. The 24 oblasts and Crimea are subdivided into 136<ref>{{cite news |title=The council reduced the number of districts in Ukraine: 136 instead of 490|url= https://www.pravda.com.ua/news/2020/07/17/7259715/|work=[[Ukrainska Pravda]] |date=17 July 2020|language=uk}}</ref> {{lang|uk-Latn|[[raion]]s}} (districts) and city municipalities of regional significance, or second-level administrative units.

[[Populated places in Ukraine]] are split into two categories: urban and rural. Urban populated places are split further into cities and [[urban-type settlement]]s (a Soviet administrative invention), while rural populated places consist of villages and settlements (a generally used term). All cities have certain degree of self-rule depending on their significance such as national significance (as in the case of Kyiv and Sevastopol), regional significance (within each oblast or autonomous republic) or district significance (all the rest of cities). A city's significance depends on several factors such as its population, socio-economic and historical importance, infrastructure and others.

Ukraine took consistent steps toward reduction of conventional weapons. It signed the [[Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe]], which called for reduction of tanks, artillery, and armoured vehicles (army forces were reduced to 300,000).

Following independence, Ukraine declared itself a neutral state.<ref name="gska2.rada.gov.ua" /> The country has had a limited military partnership with Russian Federation, other CIS countries and a [[Partnership for Peace|partnership with NATO]] since 1994. In the 2000s, the government was leaning towards NATO, and a deeper cooperation with the alliance was set by the NATO-Ukraine Action Plan signed in 2002. It was later agreed that the question of joining NATO should be answered by a national referendum at some point in the future.<ref name="wbook06" /> Recently deposed [[Ukrainian President|President]] [[Viktor Yanukovych]] considered the current level of co-operation between [[Ukraine–NATO relations|Ukraine and NATO]] sufficient, and was against Ukraine joining NATO. During the [[2008 Bucharest summit]], NATO declared that Ukraine would eventually become a member of NATO when it meets the criteria for the accession.

In Soviet times, the economy of Ukraine was the second largest in the Soviet Union, being an important industrial and agricultural component of the country's [[planned economy]].<ref name=cia /> With the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|dissolution of the Soviet system]], the country moved from a planned economy to a [[market economy]].

Day-to-day life for the average person living in Ukraine was a struggle. A significant number of citizens in rural Ukraine survived by growing their own food, often working two or more jobs and buying the basic necessities through the [[barter economy]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-30078/Ukraine |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080418030322/http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-30078/Ukraine |archive-date=18 April 2008 |title=Independent Ukraine |access-date=12 September 2007 |website=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]}}</ref>

In 1991, the government liberalised most prices to combat widespread product shortages, and was successful in overcoming the problem. At the same time, the government continued to subsidise state-run industries and agriculture by uncovered monetary emission. The loose monetary policies of the early 1990s pushed inflation to [[hyperinflation]]ary levels. For the year 1993, Ukraine holds the world record for inflation in one calendar year.<ref>{{cite news |last=Skolotiany |first=Yuriy |title=The past and the future of Ukrainian national currency |url=http://www.mw.ua/2000/2040/54367/ |access-date=8 January 2014 |newspaper=[[Zerkalo nedeli]] |date=8 September 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080625041853/http://www.mw.ua/2000/2040/54367/ |archive-date=25 June 2008}}</ref> Those living on fixed incomes suffered the most.<ref name=Britannica /> Prices stabilised only after the introduction of new currency, the [[Ukrainian hryvnia|hryvnia]], in 1996. The country was also slow in implementing structural reforms. Following independence, the government formed a legal framework for [[privatisation]]. However, widespread resistance to reforms within the government and from a significant part of the population soon stalled the reform efforts. Many state-owned enterprises were exempt from privatisation.

Post [[World War II]] Ukraine's population gradually increased to a peak of 51.9 million in 1993. From 1993 to 2014, the last year the populations in Donbas and Crimea were included, population had decreased by 6.6 million, or 12.8%. The decline was caused by a reduction in birth rate, emigration, and a slight increase in death rate, largely attributed to poor living conditions and low-quality health care.<ref name=nw-20260217>{{cite news |url=https://www.newsweek.com/nolan-peterson-why-ukraine-population-shrinking-559697 |title=Why Is Ukraine's Population Shrinking? |last=Peterson |first=Nolan |newspaper=Newsweek |date=26 February 2017 |access-date=9 July 2019}}</ref><ref name=ukrstat-population>{{cite web |url=http://www.ukrstat.gov.ua/operativ/operativ2007/ds/nas_rik/nas_e/nas_rik_e.html |title=Population |publisher=State Statistics Service of Ukraine |access-date=9 July 2019}}</ref>

The [[Ukrainian Red Cross Society]] was established in April 1918 in [[Kyiv]] as an independent humanitarian society of the [[Ukrainian People's Republic]]. Its immediate tasks were to help refugees and prisoners of war, care for handicapped people and orphaned children, fight famine and epidemics, support and organize sick quarters, hospitals and public canteens. At present, society involves more than 6.3 million supporters and activists. Its Visiting Nurses Service has 3,200 qualified nurses. The organization takes part in more than 40 humanitarian programmes all over Ukraine, which are mostly funded by public donation and corporate partnerships. By its own estimates, the Society annually provides services to more than 105,000 lonely, elderly people, about 23,000 people disabled during the Second World War and handicapped workers, more than 25,000 war veterans, and more than 8,000 adults handicapped since childhood. Assistance for orphaned and disabled children is also rendered.

Ukraine's healthcare system is state subsidised and freely available to all Ukrainian citizens and registered residents. However, it is not compulsory to be treated in a state-run hospital as a number of private medical complexes do exist nationwide.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://bestofukraine.com/travel-essentials/medical-care.html |title=Medical Care in Ukraine.

All of the country's medical service providers and hospitals are subordinate to the [[Ministry of Healthcare (Ukraine)|Ministry of Healthcare]], which provides oversight and scrutiny of general medical practice as well as being responsible for the day-to-day administration of the healthcare system. Despite this, standards of hygiene and patient-care have fallen.<ref>{{cite web |author=Ukraine |url=http://europe-cities.com/destinations/ukraine/health/ |title=Health in Ukraine.

Hospitals in Ukraine are organised along the same lines as most European nations, according to the regional administrative structure; as a result most towns have their own hospital ''(Міська Лікарня)'' and many also have district hospitals ''(Районна Лікарня)''. Larger and more specialised medical complexes tend only to be found in major cities, with some even more specialised units located only in the capital, [[Kyiv]]. However, all [[Administrative divisions of Ukraine|oblasts]] have their own network of general hospitals which are able to deal with almost all medical problems and are typically equipped with major trauma centres; such hospitals are called 'regional hospitals' ''(Обласна Лікарня)''.

Ukraine currently faces a number of major public health issues and is considered to be in a demographic crisis because of its high death rate and low birth rate (the current Ukrainian birth rate is 11 births/1,000 population, and the death rate is 16.3 deaths/1,000 population). A factor contributing to the high death rate is a high [[mortality rate]] among working-age males from preventable causes such as [[alcohol poisoning]] and smoking.<ref name="worldbank1">{{cite web |url=http://www.worldbank.org/html/prddr/trans/julaug99/pgs3-4.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090720122016/http://www.worldbank.org/html/prddr/trans/julaug99/pgs3-4.htm |archive-date=20 July 2009 |title=What Went Wrong with Foreign Advice in Ukraine? |access-date=16 January 2008 |website=The World Bank Group}}</ref> In 2008, the country's population was one of the fastest declining in the world at −5% growth.<ref name="autogenerated2002">{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2002.html |title=Field Listing – Population growth rate |access-date=5 July 2008 |website=CIA World Factbook}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ukrstat.gov.ua/ |archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20020915155109/http://www.ukrstat.gov.ua/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=15 September 2002 |title=State Statistics Committee of Ukraine |publisher=Ukrstat.gov.ua |access-date=26 January 2014}}</ref> The UN warned that Ukraine's population could fall by as much as 10 million by 2050 if trends did not improve.<ref>{{cite web |title=World Population Prospects: The 2012 Revision |url=http://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/unpp/panel_population.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140320035709/http://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/unpp/panel_population.htm |archive-date=20 March 2014 |publisher=United Nations |access-date=8 January 2014}}</ref> In addition, obesity, systemic high blood pressure and the HIV endemic are all major challenges facing the Ukrainian healthcare system.

According to the [[Constitution of Ukraine|Ukrainian constitution]], access to free education is granted to all citizens. Complete general secondary education is compulsory in the state schools which constitute the overwhelming majority. Free higher education in state and communal educational establishments is provided on a competitive basis.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rada.kiev.ua/const/conengl.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19970415063610/http://rada.kiev.ua/const/conengl.htm |archive-date=15 April 1997 |title=Constitution of Ukraine, Chapter 2, Article 53. Adopted at the Fifth Session of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine on 28 June 1996}}</ref> There is also a small number of accredited private secondary and higher education institutions.

Because of the Soviet Union's emphasis on total access of education for all citizens, which continues today, the [[literacy rate]] is an estimated 99.4%.<ref name=cia /> Since 2005, an eleven-year school programme has been replaced with a twelve-year one: primary education takes four years to complete (starting at age six), middle education (secondary) takes five years to complete; upper secondary then takes three years.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.education.gov.ua/pls/edu/docs/common/secondaryeduc_eng.html |title=General secondary education |access-date=23 December 2007 |publisher=Ministry of Education and Science of Ukraine |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071016104343/http://education.gov.ua/pls/edu/docs/common/secondaryeduc_eng.html |archive-date=16 October 2007 |url-status=dead}}</ref> In the 12th grade, students take Government tests, which are also referred to as school-leaving exams. These tests are later used for university admissions.

The first higher education institutions (HEIs) emerged in Ukraine during the late 16th and early 17th centuries. The first Ukrainian higher education institution was the [[Ostroh Academy|Ostrozka School]], or Ostrozkiy Greek-Slavic-Latin Collegium, similar to Western European higher education institutions of the time. Established in 1576 in the town of [[Ostroh|Ostrog]], the Collegium was the first higher education institution in the [[East Slavic peoples|Eastern Slavic]] territories. The oldest university was the [[National University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy|Kyiv Mohyla Academy]], first established in 1632 and in 1694 officially recognised by the government of [[Imperial Russia]] as a higher education institution. Among the oldest is also the [[Lviv University]], founded in 1661. More higher education institutions were set up in the 19th century, beginning with universities in [[Kharkiv University|Kharkiv]] (1805), [[Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv|Kyiv]] (1834), [[Odessa University|Odessa]] (1865) and [[Chernivtsi University|Chernivtsi]] (1875) and a number of professional higher education institutions, e.g.: [[Nizhyn Pedagogical University|Nizhyn Historical and Philological Institute]] (originally established as the Gymnasium of Higher Sciences in 1805), a Veterinary Institute (1873) and a [[Kharkiv Polytechnical Institute|Technological Institute]] (1885) in [[Kharkiv]], a [[Igor Sikorsky Kyiv Polytechnic Institute|Polytechnic Institute]] in [[Kyiv]] (1898) and a Higher Mining School (1899) in [[Dnipro|Katerynoslav]]. Rapid growth followed in the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Soviet]] period. By 1988 a number of higher education institutions increased to 146 with over 850,000 students.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0014/001465/146552e.pdf |title=Higher education in Ukraine; Monographs on higher education; 2006 |access-date=30 December 2010}}</ref> Most HEIs established after 1990 are those owned by private organisations.

The Ukrainian higher education system comprises higher educational establishments, [[scientific]] and [[methodological]] facilities under national, [[municipal government|municipal]] and self-governing bodies in charge of education.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.education.gov.ua/pls/edu/docs/common/higher_educ_eng.html |title=System of Higher Education of Ukraine |access-date=23 December 2007 |publisher=Ministry of Education and Science of Ukraine |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071217073746/http://www.education.gov.ua/pls/edu/docs/common/higher_educ_eng.html |archive-date=17 December 2007 |url-status=dead}}</ref> The organisation of higher education in Ukraine is built up in accordance with the structure of education of the world's higher [[developed countries]], as is defined by [[UNESCO]] and the UN.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.education.gov.ua/pls/edu/docs/common/education_eng.html |title=System of the Education of Ukraine |access-date=23 December 2007 |publisher=Ministry of Education and Science of Ukraine |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071212111804/http://www.education.gov.ua/pls/edu/docs/common/education_eng.html |archive-date=12 December 2007 |url-status=dead}}</ref>
Ukraine has more than 800 higher education institutions and in 2010 the number of graduates reached 654,700 people.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://outsourcing-ukraine.org/2011/10/14/educational-system-ukraine-facilitates-development-outsourcing-sector/ |title=Educational system in Ukraine |publisher=Outsourcing-ukraine.org |date=14 October 2011 |access-date=26 January 2014}}</ref>

Ukraine produces the fourth largest number of [[Tertiary education|post-secondary graduates]] in Europe, while being ranked seventh in population. [[Higher education in Ukraine|Higher education]] is either state funded or private. Students that study at state expense receive a standard scholarship if their average marks at the end-of-term exams and differentiated test suffice; this rule may be different in some universities. For highest grades, the scholarship is increased by 25%. For most students the government subsidy is not sufficient to cover their basic living expenses. Most universities provide subsidised housing for out-of-city students. Also, it is common for libraries to supply required books for all registered students. Ukrainian universities confer two degrees: the bachelor's degree (4&nbsp;years) and the master's degree (5–6th&nbsp;year), in accordance with the [[Bologna process]]. Historically, [[Specialist degree]] (usually 5 years) is still also granted; it was the only degree awarded by universities in the Soviet times.

The Law of Ukraine ''On Higher Education'' came into force on 6 September 2014. It was approved in Ukrainian Parliament on 1 July 2014. The main changes in the system of higher education:<ref>{{cite web |title=16 змін у вищій освіті: новий закон почав діяти |url=http://osvita.ua/vnz/reform/42795/ |access-date=22 August 2015}}</ref> a separate collegiate body to monitor the quality of education was established (Ukrainian: Національне агентство із забезпечення якості вищої освіти); each higher education institution has the right to implement its own educational and research programs; role of the student government was increased; higher education institution has the right to freely administer own revenues; 5 following types of higher education qualifications were established: Junior Bachelor, Bachelor, Master, Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) and Doctor of Science; load on lecturers and students was reduced; academic mobility for faculty and students etc.

Similar historical cleavages also remain evident at the level of individual social identification.

The tradition of the [[Easter egg]], known as [[pysanky]], has long roots in Ukraine. These eggs were drawn on with wax to create a pattern; then, the dye was applied to give the eggs their pleasant colours, the dye did not affect the previously wax-coated parts of the egg. After the entire egg was dyed, the wax was removed leaving only the colourful pattern. This tradition is thousands of years old, and precedes the arrival of Christianity to Ukraine.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cs.unc.edu/~yakowenk/pysanky/index.html |title=Pysanky – Ukrainian Easter Eggs |access-date=28 July 2008 |publisher=[[University of North Carolina]]}}</ref> In the city of [[Kolomyia]] near the foothills of the [[Carpathian Mountains]] in 2000 was built the museum of Pysanka which won a nomination as the monument of modern Ukraine in 2007, part of the [[Seven Wonders of Ukraine]] action.

Ukrainian literature again began to develop in the 14th&nbsp;century, and was advanced significantly in the 16th&nbsp;century with the introduction of [[printing|print]] and with the beginning of the Cossack era, under both Russian and Polish dominance.<ref name=ualit /> The Cossacks established an independent society and popularized a [[Duma (epic)|new kind]] of [[epic poem]]s, which marked a high point of Ukrainian [[oral literature]].<ref name=ualitmsn /> These advances were then set back in the 17th and early 18th&nbsp;centuries, when publishing in the Ukrainian language was outlawed and prohibited. Nonetheless, by the late 18th&nbsp;century modern literary Ukrainian finally emerged.<ref name=ualit />

The 19th&nbsp;century initiated a [[vernacular]] period in Ukraine, led by [[Ivan Kotliarevsky]]'s work {{lang|uk-Latn|Eneyida}}, the first publication written in modern Ukrainian. By the 1830s, Ukrainian [[romanticism]] began to develop, and the nation's most renowned cultural figure, romanticist poet-painter [[Taras Shevchenko]] emerged. Where Ivan Kotliarevsky is considered to be the father of literature in the Ukrainian vernacular; Shevchenko is the father of a national revival.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?AddButton=pages\L\I\Literature.htm |title=Literature |author=Danylo Husar Sruk |access-date=17 January 2008 |website=Encyclopedia of Ukraine}}</ref>

Then, in 1863, use of the Ukrainian language in print was effectively [[Ems Ukaz|prohibited]] by the Russian Empire.<ref name=censor /> This severely curtailed literary activity in the area, and Ukrainian writers were forced to either publish their works in Russian or release them in Austrian controlled [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]]. The ban was never officially lifted, but it became obsolete after the revolution and the Bolsheviks' coming to power.<ref name=ualitmsn />

Ukrainian literature continued to flourish in the early Soviet years, when nearly all literary trends were approved (the most important literary figures of that time were [[Mykola Khvylovy]], [[Valerian Pidmohylny]], [[Mykola Kulish]], [[Mykhayl Semenko]] and some others). These policies faced a steep decline in the 1930s, when prominent representatives as well as many others were killed by [[NKVD]] as part of the [[Great Purge]]. In general around 223 writers were repressed by what was known as the [[Executed Renaissance]].<ref>{{cite web |author=Yuriy Lavrinenko |url=http://fmm51.org.ua/html_books/lavrinenko_rozstriliane_vidrodzhennia.htm|script-title=uk:Розстріляне відродження: Антологія 1917–1933|trans-title=The Executed Renaissance: Anthology 1917–1933 |language=uk |location=Kyiv |publisher=Smoloskyl |date=2004 |archive-date=13 December 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101213085603/http://fmm51.org.ua/html_books/lavrinenko_rozstriliane_vidrodzhennia.htm}}</ref> These repressions were part of Stalin's implemented policy of [[socialist realism]]. The doctrine did not necessarily repress the use of the Ukrainian language, but it required that writers follow a certain style in their works.

In post-Stalinist times literary activities continued to be somewhat limited under the Communist Party. The most famous figures of Ukrainian post-war Soviet literature were [[Lina Kostenko]], [[Dmytro Pavlychko]], [[Borys Oliynyk (poet)]], [[Ivan Drach]], [[Oles Honchar]], [[Vasyl Stus]], [[Vasyl Symonenko]].

Literary freedom grew in the late 1980s and early 1990s alongside the decline and collapse of the USSR and the reestablishment of Ukrainian independence in 1991.<ref name=ualit />

=== Architecture ===
{{Main|Ukrainian architecture}}
[[File:80-391-9007 Kyiv St.Michael's Golden-Domed Monastery RB 18.jpg|thumb|right|[[St. Michael's Golden-Domed Cathedral]] in [[Kyiv]], foremost example of [[Cossack Baroque]] and one of Ukraine's most recognizable landmarks]]

Ukrainian architecture includes the motifs and styles that are found in structures built in modern Ukraine, and by [[Ukrainians]] worldwide.
These include initial roots which were established in the [[Eastern Slavs|Eastern Slavic]] state of [[Kyivan Rus']]. Since the [[Christianization of Kyivan Rus']] for several ages Ukrainian architecture was influenced by the [[Byzantine architecture]]. After the [[Mongol invasion of Rus|12th century]], the distinct [[architectural history]] continued in the principalities of [[Galicia-Volhynia]]. During the epoch of the [[Zaporozhian Cossacks]], a new style unique to Ukraine was developed under the western influences of the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. After the union with the [[Tsardom of Russia]], many structures in the larger eastern, Russian-ruled area were built in the styles of [[Russian architecture]] of that period, whilst the western [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]] was developed under [[Architecture of Austria|Austro-Hungarian architectural influences]]. Ukrainian national motifs would finally be used during the period of the [[Soviet Union]] and in modern independent Ukraine.

The great [[Architecture of Kyivan Rus|churches of the Rus']], built after the [[Baptism of Kyivan Rus'|adoption of Christianity]] in 988, were the first examples of monumental architecture in the East Slavic lands. The architectural style of the Kyivan state was strongly influenced by the [[Byzantine architecture|Byzantine]]. Early [[Eastern Orthodox]] churches were mainly made of wood, with the simplest form of church becoming known as a [[cell church]]. Major cathedrals often featured scores of small domes, which led some art historians to take this as an indication of the appearance of pre-Christian pagan Slavic temples.

[[File:Curitiba Parque Tingui.jpg|thumb|left|Traditional Ukrainian village [[Ukrainian architecture|architecture]] in [[Curitiba]], Brazil, which has a large [[Ukrainian diaspora]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brasil.kiev.ua/index.php?option=com_content&view=category&id=45&layout=blog&Itemid=30&9856877558d17ec206d1a87e99fb1dce=3fab537243dff8dbaf45e8c8619a395b |title=Slavic community in Curitiba |publisher=Brasil.kiev.ua |access-date=7 March 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203110425/http://www.brasil.kiev.ua/index.php?option=com_content&view=category&id=45&layout=blog&Itemid=30&9856877558d17ec206d1a87e99fb1dce=3fab537243dff8dbaf45e8c8619a395b |archive-date=3 December 2013}}</ref>]]

Several examples of these churches survive; however, during the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries, many were externally rebuilt in the [[Ukrainian Baroque]] style (see below). Examples include the grand [[Saint Sophia's Cathedral, Kyiv|St. Sophia of Kyiv]]&nbsp;– the year 1017 is the earliest record of foundation laid, [[Church of the Saviour at Berestove]] – built from 1113 to 1125 and [[St. Cyril's Monastery, Kyiv|St. Cyril's Church]], circa 12th-century. All can still be found in the Ukrainian capital. Several buildings were reconstructed during the late-19th century, including the [[:File:WladimirWolynsk Uspenski Cathedral.jpeg|Assumption Cathedral]] in [[Volodymyr-Volynskyi]], built in 1160 and reconstructed in 1896–1900, the [[:File:AX Chernigiv Pyatnitska Church.jpg|Paraskevi church in Chernihiv]], built in 1201 with reconstruction done in the late 1940s, and the [[Golden Gate, Kyiv|Golden gates in Kyiv]], built in 1037 and reconstructed in 1982. The latter's reconstruction was criticised by some art and architecture historians as a revivalist fantasy. Unfortunately little secular or [[vernacular architecture]] of [[Kyivan Rus']] has survived.

As Ukraine became increasingly integrated into the [[Russian Empire]], Russian architects had the opportunity to realise their projects in the picturesque landscape that many Ukrainian cities and regions offered. [[St Andrew's Church, Kyiv|St. Andrew's Church of Kyiv]] (1747–1754), built by [[Bartolomeo Rastrelli]], is a notable example of [[Baroque]] architecture, and its location on top of the Kyivan mountain made it a recognisable monument of the city. An equally notable contribution of Rasetrelli was the [[Mariyinsky Palace]], which was built to be a summer residence to Russian Empress [[Elizabeth of Russia|Elizabeth]]. During the reign of the last [[Hetmans of Ukrainian Cossacks|Hetman of Ukraine]], [[Kirill Razumovsky]], many of the [[Cossack Hetmanate]]'s towns such as [[Hlukhiv]], [[Baturyn]] and [[Koselets]] had grandiose projects built by [[Andrey Kvasov]]. Russia eventually conquered the south of Ukraine and Crimea, and renamed them as [[New Russia]]. New cities such as [[Mykolayiv|Nikolayev]], [[Odessa]], [[Kherson]] and [[Sevastopol]] were founded. These would contain notable examples of Imperial Russian architecture.

[[File:Kryvyi Rih - apartment building2.jpg|thumb|right|An example of a [[Khrushchyovka]] in [[Kryvyi Rih]]. Such apartments were built throughout Ukraine during Soviet times and are found in every major city.]]

In 1934, the capital of Soviet Ukraine moved from [[Kharkiv]] to [[Kyiv]]. Previously, the city was seen as only a regional centre, hence received little attention. All of that was to change, at great price. The first examples of [[Stalinist architecture]] were already showing, and, in light of the official policy, a new city was to be built on top of the old one. This meant that much-admired examples such as the [[St. Michael's Golden-Domed Monastery]] were destroyed. Even the St. Sophia Cathedral was under threat. Also, the Second World War contributed to the wreckage. After the war, a new project for the reconstruction of central Kyiv transformed [[Khreshchatyk]] avenue into a notable example of Stalinism in Architecture. However, by 1955, the new politics of architecture once again stopped the project from fully being realised.

The task for modern Ukrainian architecture is diverse application of modern aesthetics, the search for an architect's own artistic style and inclusion of the existing historico-cultural environment. An example of modern Ukrainian architecture is the reconstruction and renewal of the [[Maidan Nezalezhnosti]] in central Kyiv. Despite the limit set by narrow space within the plaza, the engineers were able to blend together the uneven landscape, and use underground space for a new shopping centre.

A major project, which may take up most of the 21st century, is the construction of the Kyiv City-Centre on the [[Rybalskyi Peninsula]], which, when finished, will include a dense skyscraper park amid the picturesque landscape of the [[Dnieper River|Dnieper]].<ref name=gradsovet_05_12_07>{{cite web |url=http://archunion.com.ua/sovet-2005/gradsovet_05_12_07.shtml |script-title=ru:Архитекторы Киева – Градостроительное обоснование внесения изменений в генеральный план развития г.

=== Music ===
{{Main|Music of Ukraine}}
[[File:Cossack Mamay 1st half of 19th c (4).jpg|thumb|[[Cossack Mamay]] playing a [[kobza]]]]

Music is a major part of Ukrainian culture, with a long history and many influences. From traditional [[folk music]], to [[classical music|classical]] and [[modern rock]], Ukraine has produced several internationally recognised musicians including [[Kirill Karabits]], [[Okean Elzy]] and [[Ruslana]]. Elements from traditional Ukrainian folk music made their way into Western music and even into modern [[jazz]].

Ukrainian music sometimes presents a perplexing mix of exotic melismatic singing with chordal harmony. The most striking general characteristic of authentic ethnic Ukrainian folk music is the wide use of minor modes or keys which incorporate augmented 2nd intervals.

[[File:Лисенко Микола.jpg|thumbnail|left|upright|[[Mykola Lysenko]] is widely considered to be the father of Ukrainian classical music.]]

During the Baroque period, music was an important discipline for those that had received a higher education in Ukraine. It had a place of considerable importance in the curriculum of the [[Kyiv-Mohyla Academy]]. Much of the nobility was well versed in music with many Ukrainian Cossack leaders such as (Mazepa, Paliy, Holovatyj, Sirko) being accomplished players of the [[kobza]], [[bandura]] or [[torban]].

The first dedicated musical academy was set up in Hlukhiv, Ukraine in 1738 and students were taught to sing, play violin and bandura from manuscripts. As a result, many of the earliest composers and performers within the Russian empire were ethnically Ukrainian, having been born or educated in Hlukhiv, or had been closely associated with this music school.
See: [[Dmytro Bortniansky]], [[Maksym Berezovsky]] and [[Artemy Vedel|Artemiy Vedel]].

Ukrainian classical music falls into three distinct categories defined by whether the composer was of Ukrainian ethnicity living in Ukraine, a composer of non-Ukrainian ethnicity who was born or at some time was a citizen of Ukraine, or an ethnic Ukrainian living outside of Ukraine within the [[Ukrainian diaspora]]. The music of these three groups differs considerably, as do the audiences for whom they cater.

[[File:Rapid Trident 2014 06.jpg|thumb|Ukrainian dance ''[[hopak]]'']]

Since the mid-1960s, Western-influenced pop music has been growing in popularity in Ukraine. Folk singer and harmonium player [[Mariana Sadovska]] is prominent. Ukrainian pop and folk music arose with the international popularity of groups and performers like [[Vopli Vidoplyasova]], [[Dakh Daughters]], [[Dakha Brakha]], [[Ivan Dorn]] and [[Okean Elzy]].

Modern musical culture of Ukraine is presented both with academic and entertainment music. Ukraine has five conservatories, 6 opera houses, five houses of Chamber Music, Philharmony in all regional centers.

Ukraine hosted the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2005]] and the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2017]].

=== Cinema ===
{{Main|Cinema of Ukraine}}
Ukraine has had an influence on the history of the cinema. Ukrainian directors [[Alexander Dovzhenko]], often cited as one of the most important early Soviet filmmakers, as well as being a pioneer of [[Soviet montage theory]], [[Dovzhenko Film Studios]], and [[Sergei Parajanov]], Armenian film director and artist who made significant contributions to Ukrainian, Armenian and Georgian cinema. He invented his own cinematic style, Ukrainian poetic cinema, which was totally out of step with the guiding principles of socialist realism.

[[File:Muratova.jpg|upright|thumbnail|[[Kira Muratova]]]]

Other important directors including [[Kira Muratova]], [[Sergei Loznitsa]], [[Myroslav Slaboshpytskyi]], [[Larisa Shepitko]], [[Sergei Bondarchuk]], [[Leonid Bykov]], [[Yuri Ilyenko]], [[Leonid Osyka]], [[Ihor Podolchak]] with his [[Delirium (2013 film)|Delirium]] and [[Maryna Vroda]]. Many Ukrainian actors have achieved international fame and critical success, including: [[Vera Kholodnaya]], [[Bohdan Stupka]], [[Milla Jovovich]], [[Olga Kurylenko]], [[Mila Kunis]].

Despite a history of important and successful productions, the industry has often been characterised by a debate about its identity and the level of European and Russian influence. Ukrainian producers are active in international co-productions and Ukrainian actors, directors and crew feature regularly in Russian (Soviet in past) films. Also successful films have been based on Ukrainian people, stories or events, including [[Battleship Potemkin]], [[Man with a Movie Camera]], [[Winter on Fire: Ukraine's Fight for Freedom]], [[Everything Is Illuminated (film)|Everything Is Illuminated]].

Ukrainian State Film Agency owns [[National Oleksandr Dovzhenko Film Centre]], film copying laboratory and archive, takes part in hosting of the [[Odessa International Film Festival]], and [[Molodist]] is the only one [[FIAPF]] accredited International Film Festival held in Ukraine; competition program is devoted to student, first short and first full feature films from all over the world. Held annually in October.

Published mainly in Ukrainian with selected articles published in or translated to Russian and English, the newspaper has particular emphasis on the politics of Ukraine. Freedom of the press in Ukraine is considered to be among the freest of the post-Soviet states other than the Baltic states.
[[Freedom House]] classifies the Internet in Ukraine as "free" and the press as "partly free". Press freedom has significantly improved since the Orange Revolution of 2004. However, in 2010 Freedom House perceived "negative trends in Ukraine".

[[Kyiv]] dominates the media sector in Ukraine: the ''[[Kyiv Post]]'' is Ukraine's leading English-language newspaper. National [[List of newspapers in Ukraine|newspapers]] ''[[Den (newspaper)|Den]]'', ''[[Zerkalo Nedeli|Mirror Weekly]]'', tabloids, such as ''[[The Ukrainian Week]]'' or ''[[Focus (Ukrainian magazine)|Focus]]'' (Russian), and television and radio are largely based there, although [[Lviv]] is also a significant national media centre. The National News Agency of Ukraine, [[Ukrinform]] was founded here in 1918. The Ukraine publishing sector, including books, directories and databases, journals, magazines and business media, newspapers and news agencies, has a combined turnover. [[Sanoma]] publishes Ukrainian editions of such magazines as ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'', ''[[Harpers Bazaar]]'' and ''[[National Geographic Magazine]]''. [[BBC Ukrainian]] started its broadcasts in 1992.

Ukrainians listen to radio programming, such as [[Radio Ukraine]] or [[Radio Liberty]], largely commercial, on average just over two-and-a-half hours a day. Several television channels operate, and many websites are popular.

Among the Ukrainians who greatly influenced the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] in this period were [[Stephen Yavorsky]], [[Feofan Prokopovich]] and [[Dimitry of Rostov]].

'''b.'''{{Note label|B|b|none}} Estimates on the number of deaths vary. Official Soviet data is not available because the Soviet government denied the existence of the famine. See the [[Holodomor]] article for details. Sources differ on interpreting various statements from different branches of different governments as to whether they amount to the official recognition of the Famine as Genocide by the country. For example, after the statement issued by the Latvian Sejm on 13 March 2008, the total number of countries is given as 19 (according to ''Ukrainian [[BBC]]'': [http://www.bbc.com/ukrainian/domestic/story/2008/03/080313_latvia_holodomor_oh.shtml {{lang|uk|"Латвія визнала Голодомор ґеноцидом"}}]), 16 (according to ''[[Korrespondent]]'', Russian edition: [http://korrespondent.net/ukraine/politics/403002 {{lang|ru|"После продолжительных дебатов Сейм Латвии признал Голодомор геноцидом украинцев"}}]), "more than 10" (according to ''Korrespondent'', Ukrainian edition: [http://ua.korrespondent.net/ukraine/403780-latviya-viznala-golodomor-1932-33-rr-genocidom-ukrayinciv {{lang|uk|"Латвія визнала Голодомор 1932–33 рр. геноцидом українців"}}]) Retrieved 27 January 2008.

'''c.'''{{Note label|C|c|1}}{{Note label|C|c|2}} These figures are likely to be much higher, as they '''do not''' include Ukrainians of other nationalities or Ukrainian Jews, but only [[ethnic]] Ukrainians, from the Ukrainian SSR.

'''d.'''{{Note label|D|d|none}} This figure excludes [[POW]] deaths.

'''e.'''{{Note label|E|e|none}} Several countries with territory in Europe have a larger total area, but all of those also include territory outside of Europe. Only Russia's European territory is larger than Ukraine.

'''f.'''{{note label|F|f|1}}{{note label|F|f|2}}{{note label|F|f|3}} According to the official [[Ukrainian Census (2001)|2001 census]] data (by nationality;<ref>{{cite web |title=About number and composition population of Kyiv city by All-Ukrainian population census'2001 data |url=http://2001.ukrcensus.gov.ua/eng/results/general/nationality/Kyiv_city/ |publisher=State Statistics Committee of Ukraine |access-date=8 January 2014}}</ref> by language<ref>{{cite web |title=Про кількість та склад населення міста Київ за підсумками Всеукраїнського перепису населення 2001 року About number and composition population of Kyiv on the results of Census 2001 |url=http://2001.ukrcensus.gov.ua/results/general/language/city_kyiv/ |publisher=State Statistics Committee of Ukraine |access-date=8 January 2014 |language=uk}}</ref>) about 75&nbsp;percent of Kyiv's population responded 'Ukrainian' to the native language (ridna mova) census question, and roughly 25&nbsp;percent responded 'Russian'. On the other hand, when the question 'What language do you use in everyday life?' was asked in the 2003 sociological survey, the Kyivans' answers were distributed as follows: 'mostly Russian': 52&nbsp;percent, 'both Russian and Ukrainian in equal measure': 32&nbsp;percent, 'mostly Ukrainian': 14&nbsp;percent, 'exclusively Ukrainian': 4.3&nbsp;percent.<br />{{cite news |url=http://www.wumag.kiev.ua/index2.php?param=pgs20032/72 |title=What language is spoken in Ukraine? |publisher=Welcome to Ukraine |date=February 2003 |access-date=11 July 2008}}
