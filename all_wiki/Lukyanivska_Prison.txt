'''Lukyanivska Prison''' ({{lang-uk|Лук'янівська в'язниця, transliterated: "Luk'yanivs'ka v'yaznitsya"}}) is a famous historical [[prison]] in the [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] capital [[Kyiv]], located in the central [[Lukyanivka (neighborhood)|Lukyanivka]] neighborhood of the city. It is officially known as '''SIZO#13''' ({{lang-uk|Слідчий ізолятор№13, Slidchyi izolyator #13}}) which is a portmanteau for '''''S'''lidchyi '''IZO'''lyator'' ({{lang-uk|слідчий ізолятор}}).

Though the facility is now functioning as a pre-conviction [[Detention (Imprisonment)|detention]] center, it is still colloquially called a "prison". The compound now includes minor examples of the historical architecture. The prison is infamous for its poor condition.<ref name=Karpachova/><ref name=KBPab/><ref name=KBPa/> Since late February 2016 the complex is on sale; its buyer has to build a new detention facility outside Kyiv in exchange for the territory of Lukyanivska Prison.<ref name="Lukyanivska Prison OS">[http://www.kyivpost.com/article/content/ukraine-politics/infamous-kyiv-prison-goes-on-sale-408765.html Infamous Kyiv prison goes on sale], [[Kyiv Post]] (Feb. 24, 2016)<br>{{in lang|uk}} [http://ua.interfax.com.ua/news/general/323586.html Jail Lukyanivska in Kyiv will be put up for sale], [[Interfax-Ukraine]] (Feb. 10, 2016)</ref>

==History==
[[File:Lukyanivska1.jpg|thumb|Historic image of Lukyanivska Prison, 1900]]
The foundation of the prison dates back to early 19th century when it was built by the [[guberniya]] architect [[Mikhail Ikonnikov]] in 1859-1862. It was officially commissioned in 1863. In Soviet times the prison's church was converted to include extra holding cells. The prison contains several subterranean corridors that connect the prison's buildings with each other. During the [[Stalinism]] it was the prison of the [[OGPU]] Ministry of Internal Affairs of the [[Soviet Union]] during which time it accounted for more than 25,000 inmates.

The prison consists of several buildings that over the years were uniquely titled by the holdovers. The oldest building is known as ''Katenka''. It is the building that kept all of those sentenced to [[life imprisonment]]. The next oldest building is called ''Stolypinka'' which was named after the [[Russians|Russian]] [[Prime Minister]] [[Pyotr Stolypin|Stolypin]]. Later another two buildings were added to its structure: ''Brezhnivka'' (built after the war) and ''Kuchmovka'' (built at times of the Ukrainian independence). There is also a [[Juvenile delinquency|juvenile detention]] building known as ''Maloletka'' ("Underage") or ''Stalinka''. Other buildings are ''ZhK'' (female building), ''Bolnichka'' (Hospital).

[[Ombudsman#Ukraine|Ukrainian Ombudsman]] [[Nina Karpachova]] stated in September 2011 that while the facility was designed for 2,850 inmates, 3,800 were held there at the time; she also pointed out that 47 inmates with [[active tuberculosis]] threatened the health of other inmates and personnel.<ref name=Karpachova/> It is reported that there is no hot water in the facility.<ref name=Guar16102011>[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/oct/16/yulia-tymoshenko-daughter-yevhenia-carr?INTCMP=SRCH Yulia Tymoshenko's daughter: 'My mother's trial was a trial of revenge'], [[guardian.co.uk]] (16 October 2011)</ref> According to [[TVI (channel)|TVi]] constitutional rights of prisoners has been violated in the institute.<ref name=KBPa>[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/nation/detail/125790/ Pshonka orders checks on penal institutions in all regions in Ukraine], [[Kyiv Post]] (10 April 2012)</ref> In April 2012 Kyiv Prosecutor [[Anatoliy Melnyk]] stated the facility was and had been regularly overcrowded.<ref name=KBPab>[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/nation/detail/125792/ Kyiv prosecutor vows to solve the problem of overcrowding in Kyiv’s detention center], [[Kyiv Post]] (11 April 2012)</ref>

In order to improve the living conditions of inmates the [[Ukrainian Ministry of Justice]] put the Lukyanivska complex on sale late February 2016.<ref name="Lukyanivska Prison OS"/>  Its buyer has to build a new detention facility outside Kyiv in exchange for the territory of Lukyanivska Prison.<ref name="Lukyanivska Prison OS"/>
