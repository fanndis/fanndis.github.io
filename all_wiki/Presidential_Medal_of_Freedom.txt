The '''Presidential Medal of Freedom''' is an award bestowed by the [[president of the United States]] to recognize people who have made "an especially meritorious contribution to the security or national interests of the United States, world peace, cultural or other significant public or private endeavors". The Presidential Medal of Freedom and the [[Congressional Gold Medal]] are the highest [[Civilian decorations of the United States|civilian awards]] of the [[United States]]. The award is not limited to [[U.S. citizenship|U.S. citizens]] and, while it is a [[civilian]] award, it can also be awarded to [[military]] personnel and worn on the [[military uniform|uniform]].
It was established in 1963 by President [[John F. Kennedy]], superseding the [[Medal of Freedom (1945)|Medal of Freedom]] that was established by President [[Harry S. Truman]] in 1945 to honor civilian service during [[World War II]].

==History of the award==
[[File:PMOFwD1.jpg|thumb|left|160px|Graphical representation of the Presidential Medal of Freedom with Distinction as worn with [[white tie]]]]
Similar in name to the [[Medal of Freedom (1945)|Medal of Freedom]],<ref name="Executive Order 9586"/> but much closer in meaning and precedence to the [[Medal for Merit]], the Presidential Medal of Freedom is currently the supreme civilian decoration in precedence in the United States, whereas the Medal of Freedom was inferior in precedence to the Medal for Merit; the Medal of Freedom was awarded by any of three [[United States Cabinet|Cabinet]] secretaries, whereas the Medal for Merit was awarded by the president, as is the Presidential Medal of Freedom.<ref name="senate.gov">{{cite web|url=https://www.senate.gov/pagelayout/reference/two_column_table/Presidential_Medal_of_Freedom_Recipients.htm|title=U.S. Senate: Presidential Medal of Freedom Recipients|date=17 November 2015|access-date=6 May 2016}}</ref>

President [[John F. Kennedy]] established the current decoration in 1963 through {{Executive Order|11085}}, with unique and distinctive insignia, vastly expanded purpose, and far higher prestige.<ref name="Executive Order 11085"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.jfklibrary.org/Research/Research-Aids/Ready-Reference/JFK-Fast-Facts/Presidential-Medal-of-Freedom.aspx|title=President Kennedy's Executive Order 11085: Presidential Medal of Freedom - John F. Kennedy Presidential Library & Museum|website=www.jfklibrary.org|access-date=2017-08-29}}</ref> It was the first U.S. civilian [[neck order|neck decoration]] and, in the grade of Awarded With Distinction, is the only U.S. sash and star decoration (the Chief Commander degree of the [[Legion of Merit]]&mdash;which may only be awarded to foreign heads of state&mdash;is a star decoration but without a sash). The executive order calls for the medal to be awarded annually on or around July 4, and at other convenient times as chosen by the president,<ref name="senate.gov"/> but it has not been awarded every year (e.g., 2001, 2010). Recipients are selected by the president, either on the president's own initiative or based on recommendations. The order establishing the medal also expanded the size and the responsibilities of the [[Distinguished Civilian Service Awards Board]] so it could serve as a major source of such recommendations.

The medal may be awarded to an individual more than once; [[Colin Powell]] received two awards, his second being With Distinction;<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=47138|title = Remarks on the Retirement of General Colin Powell in Arlington, Virginia|date = September 30, 1993|access-date = September 18, 2016|last = Clinton|first = W.

And today, you became only the second American citizen in the history of the Republic to be the recipient of two Medals of Freedom.|publisher = The American Presidency Project|location = [[University of California, Santa Barbara]]}}</ref> [[Ellsworth Bunker]] received both of his awards With Distinction. It may also be awarded posthumously; examples (in chronological order) include [[John Wayne]], [[John F. Kennedy]], [[Pope John XXIII]], [[Lyndon Johnson]], [[Bear Bryant|Paul "Bear" Bryant]], [[Thurgood Marshall]], [[Cesar Chavez]], [[Walter Reuther]], [[Roberto Clemente]], [[Jack Kemp]], [[Harvey Milk]], [[James Chaney]], [[Andrew Goodman (activist)|Andrew Goodman]], [[Michael Schwerner]], [[Elouise Cobell]], [[Grace Hopper]],<ref name=twentysixteen>{{cite web|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2016/11/16/president-obama-names-recipients-presidential-medal-freedom/|title=President Obama Names Recipients of the Presidential Medal of Freedom |author=US White House|access-date=22 Nov 2016|date=November 16, 2016}}</ref> [[Antonin Scalia]], [[Elvis Presley]] and [[Babe Ruth]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/10/politics/trump-presidential-medal-of-freedom/index.html|title=Trump to award Medal of Freedom to Elvis, Babe Ruth, among others|last=Stracqualursi|first=Veronica|work=CNN|access-date=2018-11-11}}</ref> (Chaney, Goodman and Schwerner, civil rights workers murdered in 1964, were awarded their medals in 2014, 50 years later.)

In 2015, in response to questions about the medal awarded to [[Bill Cosby]] in 2002, President [[Barack Obama]] stated that there was no precedent to revoke Presidential Medals of Freedom.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bu7sq5qZQVU|title=Obama asked if Bill Cosby's Medal of Freedom will be revoked|website=PBS NewsHour}}</ref>

==Insignia==
[[File:presidential-medal-of-freedom.jpg|thumb|180px|Medal and accoutrements including undress ribbon, miniature, and lapel badge]]
The badge of the Presidential Medal of Freedom is in the form of a golden star with white [[Vitreous enamel|enamel]], with a red enamel [[pentagon]] behind it; the central disc bears thirteen gold stars on a blue enamel background (taken from the [[Great Seal of the United States]]) within a golden ring. Golden North American [[bald eagle]]s with spread wings stand between the points of the star. It is worn around the neck on a blue ribbon with white edge stripes. Women may choose to wear the award on a bow on the left chest (See award being given to Margaret Thatcher).

A special rarely given grade of the medal, known as the Presidential Medal of Freedom with Distinction,<ref>{{cite book | last1 = Torreon | first1 = Barbara Salazar | title = A Guide to Major Congressional and Presidential Awards | volume = RS20884 | work = CRS Report for Congress | publisher = Congressional Research Service â€“ Library of Congress (United States Government) | date = 31 Mar 2004 | location = Washington, DC | page = 4 | url = http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/crs/rs20884.pdf | access-date = 2011-02-09 | quote = There are two degrees of the Medal, the higher being the Presidential Medal of Freedom with distinction. | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20111010080016/http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/crs/rs20884.pdf | archive-date = 10 October 2011 | url-status = dead }}</ref> has a larger execution of the same medal design worn as a star on the left chest along with a sash over the right shoulder (similar to how the insignia of a [[Grand Cross]] is worn), with its [[Rosette (decoration)|rosette]] (blue with white edge, bearing the central disc of the medal at its center) resting on the left hip. When the medal With Distinction is awarded, the star may be presented descending from a neck ribbon and can be identified by its larger size than the standard medal (compare the size of medals in pictures below).

Both medals may also be worn in miniature form on a ribbon on the left chest, with a silver North American bald eagle with spread wings on the ribbon, or a golden North American bald eagle for a medal awarded With Distinction. In addition, the medal is accompanied by a [[service ribbon]] for wear on military service uniform, a miniature medal pendant for wear on [[mess dress]] or civilian [[formal wear]], and a [[lapel pin|lapel badge]] for wear on civilian clothes (all shown in the accompanying photograph of the full presentation set).
