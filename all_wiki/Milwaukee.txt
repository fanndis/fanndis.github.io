The first recorded inhabitants of the Milwaukee area are the [[Algonquin peoples|Algonquin]] and [[Ho-Chunk|Siouan]] peoples. [[Roman Catholicism in France|French Catholic]] [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]], who ministered to Native Americans and [[fur trade]]rs, were the first Europeans to pass through the area. In 1818, the French Canadian explorer [[Solomon Juneau]] established a permanent settlement, and in 1846, Juneau's town combined with two neighboring towns to incorporate as the city of Milwaukee. Large numbers of [[German people|German]] immigrants arrived during the late 1840s, after the German revolutions, with [[Poles]] and other [[immigrants]] from eastern Europe arriving in the following decades. Milwaukee is known for its [[brewing]] traditions that began with the German immigrants.

In the mid-twentieth century large numbers of African Americans moved to Milwaukee from southern states for work during the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]]. African Americans from Chicago descended from those who were part of the Great Migration  have continued to move to the north side of Milwaukee since then.  Milwaukee's east side has attracted a population of Russians and other Eastern Europeans who began migrating in the 1990s after the end of the Cold War.  Many Hispanics of mostly Puerto Rican and Mexican heritage live on the south side of Milwaukee.

Beginning in the early 21st century, the city has been undergoing its largest construction boom since [[History of Milwaukee#1960 to 1995|the 1960s]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.jsonline.com/story/money/real-estate/commercial/2017/03/04/extraordinary-building-boom-reshaping-milwaukees-skyline/98477354/|title=Extraordinary building boom is reshaping Milwaukee's skyline|newspaper=Milwaukee Journal Sentinel|access-date=2017-03-21}}</ref> Major new additions to the city in the past two decades include the [[Milwaukee Riverwalk]], the [[Wisconsin Center]], [[Miller Park (Milwaukee)|Miller Park]], [[The Hop (streetcar)|The Hop (streetcar system)]], an expansion to the [[Milwaukee Art Museum]], [[Milwaukee Repertory Theater]], and [[Discovery World|Pier Wisconsin]], as well as major renovations to the [[UW–Milwaukee Panther Arena]]. The [[Fiserv Forum]] opened in late 2018 and hosts sporting events and concerts. [[Summerfest]], the largest music festival in the world, is also a large economic engine and cultural attraction for the city. In 2018, Milwaukee was named "The Coolest City in the Midwest" by ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'' magazine.

==History==
{{Main|History of Milwaukee}}

=== Name ===
The name "Milwaukee" comes from an [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]] word {{lang|alg|millioke}}, meaning "good", "beautiful" and "pleasant land" (compare {{lang-pot|minwaking}}, {{lang-oj|ominowakiing}}) or "gathering place [by the water]" (compare {{lang-pot|manwaking|links=no}}, {{lang-oj|omaniwakiing|links=no}}).<ref name="namedef">{{cite book|last= Bruce |first= William George |year= 1936 |title= A Short History of Milwaukee |location= Milwaukee, Wisconsin |publisher= The Bruce Publishing Company |page= 15|lccn= 36010193 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.freelang.net/dictionary/ojibwe.html |title=Ojibwe Dictionary |publisher=Freelang |access-date=2007-03-25}}</ref> The name has a less pleasant connotation in the [[Menominee language]], where it is called ''Māēnāēwah,'' "some misfortune happens".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www4.uwsp.edu/museum/menomineeClans/places/chart.aspx|title=Menominee Place Names in Wisconsin|last=Hoffman|first=Mike|website=The Menominee Clans Story|access-date=2018-10-05}}</ref>

===Native American Milwaukee===
Indigenous cultures lived along the waterways for thousands of years. The first recorded inhabitants of the Milwaukee area are the historic [[Menominee]], [[Fox (tribe)|Fox]], [[Mascouten]], [[Sauk people|Sauk]], [[Potawatomi]], and [[Ojibwe]] (all Algic/Algonquian peoples); and [[Ho-Chunk]] (Winnebago, a Siouan people) [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribes. Many of these people had lived around [[Green Bay, Wisconsin|Green Bay]]<ref>{{cite book|last=White|first=Richard|title=The Middle Ground|year=1991|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=New York|page=146|isbn=9781139495684|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fHLfiOZVzmMC&pg=PA146}}</ref> before migrating to the Milwaukee area around the time of European contact.

In the second half of the 18th century, the Native Americans living near Milwaukee played a role in all the major European wars on the American continent. During the [[French and Indian War]], a group of "Ojibwas and Pottawattamies from the far [Lake] Michigan" (i.e., the area from Milwaukee to Green Bay) joined the French-Canadian [[Daniel Liénard de Beaujeu]] at the [[Battle of the Monongahela]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Fowler|first=William|title=Empires at War|year=2005|publisher=Walker & Company |location=New York|page=68|isbn=9780802719355|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XqukoiTFL_oC&pg=PA68}}</ref> In the [[American Revolutionary War]], the Native Americans around Milwaukee were some of the few groups to ally with the rebel Continentals.<ref>{{cite book|last=White|first=Richard|title=The Middle Ground|year=1991|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=New York|page=400|isbn=9781139495684|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fHLfiOZVzmMC&pg=PA400}}</ref>

After the Revolutionary War, the Native Americans fought the United States in the [[Northwest Indian War]] as part of the [[Council of Three Fires]]. During the [[War of 1812]], they held a council in Milwaukee in June 1812, which resulted in their decision to attack [[Chicago]]<ref>{{cite book|last=Keating|first=Ann|title=Rising Up from Indian Country|year=2012|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=137}}</ref> in retaliation against American expansion. This resulted in the [[Battle of Fort Dearborn]] on August 15, 1812, the only known armed conflict in the Chicago area. This battle convinced the American government that the Native Americans had to be removed from their land. After being attacked in the [[Black Hawk War]] in 1832, the Native Americans in Milwaukee signed the [[Treaty of Chicago#1833 Treaty of Chicago|Treaty of Chicago]] with the United States in 1833. In exchange for their ceding their lands in the area, they were to receive monetary payments and lands west of the Mississippi in [[Indian Territory]].

===Milwaukee since European settlement===
[[File:Solomon Juneau.jpg|thumb|left|Statue of [[Solomon Juneau]], who helped establish the city of Milwaukee]]

Europeans had arrived in the Milwaukee area prior to the 1833 Treaty of Chicago. French missionaries and traders first passed through the area in the late 17th and 18th centuries. Alexis Laframboise, in 1785, coming from Michilimackinac (now in Michigan) settled a trading post; and is considered the first resident of European descent in the Milwaukee region.<ref name="St-Pierre, T 1895">St-Pierre, T. ''Histoire des Canadiens du Michigan et du comté d'essex, Ontario''. ''Cahiers du septentrion'', vol. 17. Sillery, Québec: Septentrion. 2000; 1895.</ref> Early explorers called the Milwaukee River and surrounding lands various names: Melleorki, Milwacky, Mahn-a-waukie, Milwarck, and Milwaucki, in efforts to transliterate the native terms. For many years, printed records gave the name as "Milwaukie".{{cn|date=April 2020}}

One story on the origin of Milwaukee's name says,
{{quote|[O]ne day during the thirties of the last century [1800s] a newspaper calmly changed the name to Milwaukee, and Milwaukee it has remained until this day.<ref name="WGBruce">{{cite book|last= Bruce |first= William George |year= 1936 |title= A Short History of Milwaukee |location= Milwaukee, Wisconsin |publisher= The Bruce Publishing Company |pages= 15–16|lccn= 36010193 }}</ref>}}
The spelling "Milwaukie" lives on in [[Milwaukie]], [[Oregon]], named after the Wisconsin city in 1847, before the current spelling was universally accepted.{{cn|date=April 2020}}

Milwaukee has three "[[founding fathers]]": [[Solomon Juneau]], [[Byron Kilbourn]], and [[George H. Walker]]. Solomon Juneau was the first of the three to come to the area, in 1818. He founded a town called Juneau's Side, or Juneautown, that began attracting more settlers. In competition with Juneau, Byron Kilbourn established Kilbourntown west of the [[Milwaukee River]]. He ensured the roads running toward the river did not join with those on the east side. This accounts for the large number of angled bridges that still exist in Milwaukee today.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://emke.uwm.edu/entry/bridges/|title=Bridges {{!}} Encyclopedia of Milwaukee|website=emke.uwm.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-03}}</ref> Further, Kilbourn distributed maps of the area which only showed Kilbourntown, implying Juneautown did not exist or the river's east side was uninhabited and thus undesirable. The third prominent developer was George H. Walker. He claimed land to the south of the Milwaukee River, along with Juneautown, where he built a log house in 1834. This area grew and became known as Walker's Point.{{cn|date=April 2020}}

The first large wave of settlement to the areas that would later become Milwaukee County and the City of Milwaukee began in 1835, following removal of the tribes in the Council of Three Fires. Early that year it became known that Juneau and Kilbourn intended to lay out competing town-sites. By the year's end both had purchased their lands from the government and made their first sales. There were perhaps 100 new settlers in this year, mostly from New England and other Eastern states. On September 17, 1835, the first election was held in Milwaukee; the number of votes cast was 39.<ref>{{Citation-attribution|{{Cite book|title = Memoirs of Milwaukee County from the Earliest Historical Times ..., Vol. I|last = Watrous|first = Jerome A.|publisher = Western Historical Association|year = 1909|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=XD4VAAAAYAAJ&q=editions:Jqsw4p18KfAC|location = Madison, Wisconsin|pages = 265–267}}}}</ref>

By 1840, the three towns had grown, along with their rivalries. There were intense battles between the towns, mainly Juneautown and Kilbourntown, which culminated with the [[Milwaukee Bridge War]] of 1845. Following the Bridge War, town leaders decided the best course of action was to officially unite the towns. So, on January 31, 1846, they combined to incorporate as the City of Milwaukee and elected Solomon Juneau as Milwaukee's first mayor.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://192.159.83.40/SOS/pdf/THEOSOS_025/images/00014104.pdf |title=City of Milwaukee Incorporated, page 164, 1846; page 314, 1851 |access-date=April 8, 2007 |author=City of Milwaukee |publisher=Office of the Secretary of State of Wisconsin|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070605144656/http://192.159.83.40/SOS/pdf/THEOSOS_025/images/00014104.pdf <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archive-date = June 5, 2007}}</ref>

Milwaukee began to grow as a city as high numbers of immigrants, mainly [[Germans|German]], made their way to Wisconsin during the 1840s and 1850s. Scholars classify [[German immigration to the United States]] in three major waves, and Wisconsin received a significant number of immigrants from all three. The first wave from 1845 to 1855 consisted mainly of people from [[Southwestern Germany]], the second wave from 1865 to 1873 concerned primarily [[Northwestern Germany]], while the third wave from 1880 to 1893 came from [[Northeastern Germany]].<ref name="Bungert, Heike 2006">Bungert, Heike, Cora Lee Kluge and Robert C. Ostergren. ''Wisconsin German Land and Life''. Madison: [[Max Kade Institute]] for German-American Studies, 2006.</ref> In the 1840s, the number of people who left German-speaking lands was 385,434, in the 1850s it reached 976,072, and an all-time high of 1.4&nbsp;million immigrated in the 1880s. In 1890, the 2.78&nbsp;million first-generation German Americans represented the second-largest foreign-born group in the United States. Of all those who left the German lands between 1835 and 1910, 90 percent went to the United States, most of them traveling to the Mid-Atlantic states and the Midwest.<ref name="Bungert, Heike 2006" />

By 1900 34 percent of Milwaukee's population was of German background.<ref name="Bungert, Heike 2006" /> The largest number of German immigrants to Milwaukee came from [[Prussia]], followed by [[Bavaria]], [[Saxony]], [[Hanover]], and [[Hesse-Darmstadt]]. Milwaukee gained its reputation as the most German of American cities not just from the large number of German immigrants it received, but for the sense of community which the immigrants established here.<ref name="Conzen, Kathleen Neils 1860">Conzen, Kathleen Neils. ''Immigrant Milwaukee, 1836–1860''. Cambridge, Massachusetts and London, England: [[Harvard University Press]], 1976.</ref>

Most German immigrants came to Wisconsin in search of inexpensive farmland.<ref name="Conzen, Kathleen Neils 1860" /> However, immigration began to change in character and size in the late 1840s and early 1850s, due to the 1848 revolutionary movements in Europe.<ref>Conzen, Kathleen Neils. {{" '}}The German Athens' Milwaukee and the Accommodation of Its Immigrants 1836–1860." PhD diss., vol. 1, University of Wisconsin-Madison, 1972.</ref> After 1848, hopes for a united Germany had failed, and revolutionary and radical Germans, known as the "[[Forty-Eighters]]", turned their attention to the United States.{{cn|date=April 2020}}

One of the most famous "liberal revolutionaries" of 1848 was [[Carl Schurz]]. He later explained in 1854 why he came to Milwaukee,
<blockquote>"It is true, similar things [cultural events and societies] were done in other cities where the Forty-eighters {{sic}} had congregated. But so far as I know, nowhere did their influence so quickly impress itself upon the whole social atmosphere as in 'German Athens of America' as Milwaukee was called at the time."<ref>"[http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/Content.aspx?dsNav=Ny:True,Ro:0,N:4294963828-4294963788&dsNavOnly=Ntk:All%7cMilwaukee+and+Watertown+as+Seen+by+Schurz+in+1854%7c3%7c,Ny:True,Ro:0&dsRecordDetails=R:BA4176&dsDimensionSearch=D:Milwaukee+and+Watertown+as+Seen+by+Schurz+in+1854,Dxm:All,Dxp:3&dsCompoundDimensionSearch=D:Milwaukee+and+Watertown+as+Seen+by+Schurz+in+1854,Dxm:All,Dxp:3 Milwaukee and Watertown as Seen by Schurz in 1854]". ''The Milwaukee Journal'', October 21, 1941. Accessed February 5, 2013.</ref></blockquote>

Schurz was referring to the various clubs and societies Germans developed in Milwaukee. The pattern of German immigrants to settle near each other encouraged the continuation of the German lifestyle and customs. This resulted in [[German language]] organizations that encompassed all aspects of life; for example, singing societies and gymnastics clubs. Germans also had a lasting influence on the American school system. [[Kindergarten]] was created as a pre-school for children, and sports programs of all levels, as well as music and art were incorporated as elements of the regular school curriculum. These ideas were first introduced by radical-democratic German groups, such as the Socialist Turner Societies, known today as the [[American Turners]]. Specifically in Milwaukee, the American [[Turners]] established its own [[Normal College]] for teachers of physical education and a German-English Academy.<ref>Rippley, LaVern J. and Eberhard Reichmann, trans.

Milwaukee's German element is still strongly present today. The city celebrates its German culture by annually hosting a German Fest in July and an [[Oktoberfest]] in October. Milwaukee boasts a number of German restaurants, as well as a traditional German beer hall. A German language [[immersion school]] is offered for children in grades [[K-5 (education)|K-5]].<ref name=immersionschool>{{cite web|title=Milwaukee German Immersion School|url=http://www5.milwaukee.k12.wi.us/school/mgis/|website=5.milwaukee.k12.wi.us|access-date=April 24, 2015}}</ref>

Although the German presence in Milwaukee after the Civil War remained strong and their largest wave of immigrants had yet to land, other groups also made their way to the city. Foremost among these were [[Polish people|Polish]] immigrants. The Poles had many reasons for leaving their homeland, mainly poverty and political oppression. Because Milwaukee offered the Polish immigrants an abundance of low-paying entry level jobs, it became one of the largest [[Polish settlements in the USA]].{{cn|date=April 2020}}

For many residents, [[Neighborhoods of Milwaukee#Milwaukee's South Side|Milwaukee's South Side]] is synonymous with the [[#Polish immigrants|Polish community]] that developed here. The group maintained a high profile here for decades, and it was not until the 1950s and 1960s that families began to disperse to the southern suburbs.{{cn|date=April 2020}}

By 1850, there were seventy-five Poles in [[Milwaukee County, Wisconsin|Milwaukee County]] and the [[US Census]] shows they had a variety of occupations: grocers, blacksmiths, tavernkeepers, coopers, butchers, broommakers, shoemakers, draymen, laborers, and farmers. Three distinct Polish communities evolved in Milwaukee, with the majority settling in the area south of Greenfield Avenue. Milwaukee County's Polish population of 30,000 in 1890 rose to 100,000 by 1915. Poles historically have had a strong national cultural and social identity, maintained through the Catholic Church. A view of Milwaukee's South Side skyline is replete with the steeples of the many churches these immigrants built that are still vital centers of the community.{{cn|date=April 2020}}

[[St. Stanislaus Catholic Church (Milwaukee, Wisconsin)|St. Stanislaus Catholic Church]] and the surrounding [[Neighborhoods of Milwaukee|neighborhood]] was the center of [[Polish people|Polish]] life in Milwaukee. As the Polish community surrounding St. Stanislaus continued to grow, Mitchell Street became known as the "Polish Grand Avenue". As Mitchell Street grew more dense, the Polish population started moving south to the [[Lincoln Village, City of Milwaukee, Wisconsin|Lincoln Village neighborhood]], home to the [[Basilica of St. Josaphat]] and [[Lincoln Village, City of Milwaukee, Wisconsin#Kosciuszko Park|Kosciuszko Park]]. Other Polish communities started on the east side of Milwaukee. [[Neighborhoods of Milwaukee#Jones Island|Jones Island]] was a major [[commercial fishing]] center settled mostly by Poles from around the [[Baltic Sea]].{{cn|date=April 2020}}

Milwaukee has the fifth-largest Polish population in the U.S. at 45,467, ranking behind [[New York City]] (211,203), [[Chicago]] (165,784), [[Los Angeles]] (60,316) and [[Philadelphia]] (52,648).<ref name="factfinder2.census.gov">{{cite web|url=http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=ACS_12_3YR_B04003&prodType=table|archive-url=https://archive.today/20200212213036/http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=ACS_12_3YR_B04003&prodType=table|url-status=dead|archive-date=2020-02-12|title=American FactFinder – Results|author=Data Access and Dissemination Systems (DADS)}}</ref> The city holds [[Polish Fest]], an annual celebration of [[Polish culture]] and [[Polish food|cuisine]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.jsonline.com/story/entertainment/events/2018/06/13/polish-fest-100th-anniversary-poland/673094002/|title=Polish Fest celebrates the 100th anniversary of the rebirth of a nation|work=Milwaukee Journal Sentinel|access-date=2018-10-03|language=en}}</ref>

In addition to the Germans and Poles, Milwaukee received a large influx of other [[Europe]]an immigrants from [[Lithuania]], [[Italy]], [[Ireland]], [[France]], [[Russia]], [[Bohemia]] and [[Sweden]], who included [[American Jews|Jews]], [[Lutherans]], and [[Catholics]].

By 1925, around 9,000 [[Mexican Americans|Mexicans]] lived in Milwaukee, but the [[Great Depression]] forced many of them to move back south. In the 1950s, the Hispanic community was beginning to emerge. They arrived for jobs, filling positions in the manufacturing and agricultural sectors. During this time there were labor shortages due to the immigration laws that had reduced immigration from eastern and southern Europe. Additionally, strikes contributed to the labor shortages.<ref name="test">[http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/turningpoints/tp-052/?action=more_essay Wisconsinhistory.org], additional text.</ref>

During the first sixty years of the 20th century, Milwaukee was the major city in which the [[Socialist Party of America]] earned the highest votes. Milwaukee elected three [[mayor]]s who ran on the ticket of the Socialist Party: [[Emil Seidel]] (1910–1912), [[Daniel Hoan]] (1916–1940), and [[Frank Zeidler]] (1948–1960). Often referred to as "[[Sewer Socialism|Sewer Socialists]]", the Milwaukee Socialists were characterized by their practical approach to government and labor.{{cn|date=April 2020}}

===Historic neighborhoods===

[[File:Third Ward MKEa.jpg|thumb|The historic Third Ward]]

In 1892, [[Whitefish Bay, Wisconsin|Whitefish Bay]], [[South Milwaukee, Wisconsin|South Milwaukee]], and [[Wauwatosa, Wisconsin|Wauwatosa]] were incorporated. They were followed by [[Cudahy, Wisconsin|Cudahy]] (1895), North Milwaukee (1897) and East Milwaukee, later known as [[Shorewood, Wisconsin|Shorewood]], in 1900. In the early 20th century [[West Allis, Wisconsin|West Allis]] (1902), and [[West Milwaukee, Wisconsin|West Milwaukee]] (1906) were added, which completed the first generation of "inner-ring" suburbs.

In the 1920s, [[Chicago]] gangster activity came north to Milwaukee during the [[Prohibition era]]. [[Al Capone]], noted Chicago mobster, owned a home in the Milwaukee suburb [[Brookfield, Wisconsin|Brookfield]], where [[moonshine]] was made. The house still stands on a street named after Capone.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.brookfieldnow.com/news/102435199.html |date=November 11, 2010 |title=It's everyday life that keeps local historian fascinated: But the Hollywood- worthy moments aren't bad, either? |author=Nan Bialek}}</ref>

By 1960, Milwaukee had grown to become one of the largest cities in the United States. Its population peaked at 741,324. In 1960, the Census Bureau reported city's population as 91.1% white and 8.4% black.<ref>{{cite web|title=Race and Hispanic Origin for Selected Cities and Other Places: Earliest Census to 1990 |publisher=U.S. Census Bureau |url=https://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0076/twps0076.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120812191959/http://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0076/twps0076.html |archive-date=August 12, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

By the late 1960s, Milwaukee's population had started to decline as people moved to suburbs, aided by federal subsidies of highways. They moved to take advantage of new housing.<ref>Glabere, Michael. "Milwaukee:A Tale of Three Cities" in, ''From Redlining to Reinvestment: Community Responses to Urban Disinvestment'' edited by Gregory D. Squires. Philadelphia: Temple University Press, 2011; p. 151 and ''passim''</ref> Milwaukee had a population of 594,833 by 2010, while the population of the overall metropolitan area increased. Given its large immigrant population and historic neighborhoods, Milwaukee avoided the severe declines of some of its fellow "[[Rust Belt]]" cities.

[[File:Brady Street, Milwuakee, Wisconsin in 2007.jpg|thumb|Brady Street, Milwaukee]]

Since the 1980s, the city has begun to make strides in improving its economy, neighborhoods, and image, resulting in the revitalization of neighborhoods such as the [[Historic Third Ward, Milwaukee|Historic Third Ward]], [[Lincoln Village, City of Milwaukee, Wisconsin|Lincoln Village]], the [[East Side, Milwaukee|East Side]], and more recently Walker's Point and [[Bay View, Milwaukee|Bay View]], along with attracting new businesses to its downtown area. These efforts have substantially slowed the population decline and have stabilized many parts of Milwaukee.

Milwaukee's European history is evident today. Largely through its efforts to preserve its history, Milwaukee was named one of the "Dozen Distinctive Destinations" by the [[National Trust for Historic Preservation]] in 2006.<ref name="distinctive">{{cite web| url=http://www.preservationnation.org/travel-and-sites/sites/midwest-region/milwaukee-wi-2006.html| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100222174953/http://www.preservationnation.org/travel-and-sites/sites/midwest-region/milwaukee-wi-2006.html| archive-date=February 22, 2010| title=Dozen Distinctive Destinations – Milwaukee| publisher=[[National Trust for Historic Preservation]]| year=2006}}</ref>

==Geography==
[[File:Milwaukee aerial.jpg|thumb|Aerial view from the north – the [[Menomonee River]], [[Kinnickinnic River (Milwaukee River tributary)|Kinnickinnic River]], and [[Milwaukee River]] are visible in the foreground; [[Wind Point]] in the background.]]

Milwaukee lies along the shores and bluffs of [[Lake Michigan]] at the confluence of three rivers: the [[Menomonee River|Menomonee]], the [[Kinnickinnic River (Milwaukee River)|Kinnickinnic]], and the [[Milwaukee River|Milwaukee]]. Smaller rivers, such as the [[Root River (Wisconsin)|Root River]] and Lincoln Creek, also flow through the city.

Milwaukee's terrain is sculpted by the glacier path and includes steep bluffs along Lake Michigan that begin about a mile (1.6&nbsp;km) north of downtown. In addition, {{convert|30|mi|km}} southwest of Milwaukee is the Kettle Moraine and lake country that provides an industrial landscape combined with inland lakes.

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|96.80|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which, {{convert|96.12|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{convert|0.68|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is water.<ref name="Gazetteer files">{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010 |url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |access-date=November 18, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112090031/http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |archive-date=January 12, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> The city is overwhelmingly (99.89% of its area) in [[Milwaukee County, Wisconsin|Milwaukee County]], but there are two tiny unpopulated parts of it that extend into neighboring counties. The part in [[Washington County, Wisconsin|Washington County]] is bordered by the southeast corner of [[Germantown, Wisconsin|Germantown]], while the part in [[Waukesha County, Wisconsin|Waukesha County]] is bordered by the southeast corner of [[Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin|Menomonee Falls]], north of the village of [[Butler, Waukesha County, Wisconsin|Butler]]. Both were annexations done for industrial concerns, with the Waukesha County portion containing a [[Cargill]] plant for Ambrosia Chocolate, and the Washington County portion containing a [[Waste Management (corporation)|Waste Management]] facility.

North–south streets are numbered, and east–west streets are named. However, north–south streets east of 1st Street are named, like east–west streets. The north–south numbering line is along the Menomonee River (east of Hawley Road) and Fairview Avenue/Golfview Parkway (west of Hawley Road), with the east–west numbering line defined along 1st Street (north of Oklahoma Avenue) and Chase/Howell Avenue (south of Oklahoma Avenue). This numbering system is also used to the north by [[Mequon, Wisconsin|Mequon]] in [[Ozaukee County, Wisconsin|Ozaukee County]], and by some [[Waukesha County, Wisconsin|Waukesha County]] communities.

Milwaukee is crossed by [[Interstate 43]] and [[Interstate 94]], which come together [[Downtown Milwaukee|downtown]] at the [[Marquette Interchange]]. The [[Interstate 894]] bypass (which as of May 2015 also contains [[Interstate 41]]) runs through portions of the city's southwest side, and [[Interstate 794]] comes out of the Marquette interchange eastbound, bends south along the lakefront and crosses the harbor over the [[Hoan Bridge]], then ends near the [[Bay View, Milwaukee|Bay View]] [[Neighborhoods of Milwaukee|neighborhood]] and becomes the "Lake Parkway" ([[Wisconsin Highway 794|WIS-794]]).

One of the distinctive traits of Milwaukee's residential areas are the neighborhoods full of so-called [[Polish flat]]s. These are two-[[family]] [[home]]s with separate entrances, but with the units stacked one on top of another instead of side-by-side. This arrangement enables a family of limited means to purchase both a home and a modestly priced [[rental]] [[apartment]] unit. Since [[Polish-American]] immigrants to the area prized land ownership, this solution, which was prominent in their areas of settlement within the city, came to be associated with them.

The tallest building in the city is the [[U.S. Bank Center (Milwaukee)|U.S. Bank Center]].

===Climate===
{{seealso|Climate change in Wisconsin}}
Milwaukee's location in the [[Great Lakes region (North America)|Great Lakes Region]] often has rapidly changing weather, producing a [[humid continental climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Dfa''), with cold, windy, snowy winters, and warm, humid summers. The warmest month of the year is July, when the 24-hour average is {{convert|71.8|F|1}}, while January is the coldest month, with a 24-hour average of {{convert|22.3|F|1}}.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather.php3?s=004627| title=Historical Weather for Milwaukee, Wisconsin| publisher=Weatherbase| access-date=October 2, 2006}}</ref>

Because of Milwaukee's proximity to Lake Michigan, a convection current forms around mid-afternoon in light wind, resulting in the so-called "lake breeze" – a smaller scale version of the more common [[sea breeze]]. The lake breeze is most common between the months of March and July. This onshore flow causes cooler temperatures to move inland usually {{convert|5|to|15|mi|0}}, with much warmer conditions persisting further inland. Because Milwaukee's official climate site, [[Milwaukee Mitchell International Airport]], is only {{convert|3|mi}} from the lake, seasonal temperature variations are less extreme than in many other locations of the [[Milwaukee metropolitan area]].

As the sun sets, the convection current reverses and an offshore flow ensues causing a land breeze. After a land breeze develops, warmer temperatures flow east toward the lakeshore, sometimes causing high temperatures during the late evening. The lake breeze is not a daily occurrence and will not usually form if a southwest, west, or northwest wind generally exceeds {{convert|15|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}. The lake moderates cold air outbreaks along the lakeshore during winter months.

Aside from the lake's influence, overnight lows in downtown Milwaukee year-round are often much warmer than suburban locations because of the [[urban heat island effect]]. Onshore winds elevate daytime [[relative humidity]] levels in Milwaukee as compared to inland locations nearby.

Thunderstorms in the region can be dangerous and damaging, bringing [[hail]] and high winds. In rare instances, they can bring a [[tornado]]. However, almost all summer rainfall in the city is brought by these storms. In spring and fall, longer events of prolonged, lighter rain bring most of the [[precipitation]]. A moderate snow cover can be seen on or linger for many winter days, but even during meteorological winter, on average, over 40% of days see less than {{convert|1|in|cm|1}} on the ground.<ref name="NOAA txt" />

Milwaukee tends to experience highs that are {{convert|90|°F|0}} on or above seven days per year, and lows at or below {{convert|0|°F|0}} on six to seven nights.<ref name="NOAA txt" /> Extremes range from {{convert|105|F|C|abbr=on}} set on July 24, 1934 down to {{convert|−26|F|0}} on both January 17, 1982 and February 4, 1996.<ref name = NOAA /> The 1982 event, also known as [[Cold Sunday]], featured temperatures as low as {{convert|−40|°F|0}} in some of the [[suburb]]s as little as {{convert|10|mi}} to the north of Milwaukee.

==== Climate change ====
According to the United States' [[Environmental Protection Agency]], Milwaukee is threatened by ongoing [[climate change]] which is warming the planet. These risk include worsened heat waves because many of its residents do not possess [[air conditioner]]s, concerns about the water quality of Lake Michigan, and increased chances of flooding from intense rainstorms.<ref name="EPA">{{cite web|url=https://19january2017snapshot.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2016-09/documents/climate-change-wi.pdf|title=What Climate Change Means for Wisconsin|publisher=[[United States Environmental Protection Agency]]|date=August 2016}}</ref> In 2018, Milwaukee's mayor [[Tom Barrett (Wisconsin politician)|Tom Barrett]] announced that the city would uphold its obligations under the [[Paris Agreement]], despite the United States' withdrawal, and set a goal moving a quarter of the city's electricity sources to renewable energy by 2025. These have included expansions in the city's solar power-generating capacity and a [[wind turbine]]'s installation near the Port of Milwaukee.

===Water===
In the 1990s and 2000s, Lake Michigan experienced large [[algal bloom|algae blooms]], which can threaten aquatic life. Responding to this problem, in 2009 the city became an "Innovating City" in the [[United Nations Global Compact|Global Compact]] Cities Program. The Milwaukee Water Council was also formed in 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://thewatercouncil.com/wp-content/uploads/Our_History_Web_4-19-19.pdf|title= Our History|publisher = Milwaukee Water Council |website = Thewatercouncil.com}}</ref> Its objectives were to "better understand the processes related to freshwater systems dynamics" and to develop "a policy and management program aimed at balancing the protection and utilization of freshwater". The strategy used the [[Circles of Sustainability]] method. Instead of treating the water quality problem as a single environmental issue, the Water Council draws on the Circles method to analyze the interconnection among ecological, economic, political and cultural factors.<ref>[http://citiesprogramme.com/aboutus/our-approach/circles-of-sustainability Circles of Sustainability] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170702212539/http://citiesprogramme.com/aboutus/our-approach/circles-of-sustainability |date=July 2, 2017 }}.

The [[School Sisters of the Third Order of St Francis]] have their mother house in Milwaukee, and several other religious orders have a significant presence in the area, including the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]] and [[Franciscan]]s. Milwaukee, where [[Joseph Kentenich|Father Josef Kentenich]] was exiled for 14 years from 1952 to 1965, is also the center for the [[Schoenstatt Movement]] in the United States. [[St. Joan of Arc Chapel]], the oldest church in Milwaukee, is on the [[Marquette University]] campus. [[St. Josaphat Basilica]] was the first church to be given the Basilica honor in Wisconsin and the third in the United States. [[Holy Hill National Shrine of Mary, Help of Christians]], northwest of Milwaukee, in [[Hubertus, Wisconsin]], was also made a Basilica in 2006.

Milwaukee is home for several [[Lutheran]] synods, including the [[Greater Milwaukee Synod]] of the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America]]; the [[Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod]] (LCMS), which operates [[Concordia University Wisconsin]] in [[Mequon, Wisconsin|Mequon]] and [[Milwaukee Lutheran High School]], the nation's oldest Lutheran high school; and the [[Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod]] (WELS), which was founded in 1850 in Milwaukee.

==Economy==
===Early economy===
Milwaukee's founding fathers had a vision for the city: they knew it was perfectly situated as a port city, a center for collecting and distributing produce. Many of the new [[immigrants]] who were pouring into the new state of Wisconsin during the middle of the 19th century were wheat farmers. By 1860, Wisconsin was the second ranked [[wheat]]-growing state in the country and Milwaukee shipped more wheat than any place in the world. [[Rail transport|Railroads]] were needed to transport all this grain from the wheat fields of Wisconsin to Milwaukee's [[harbor]]. Improvements in railways at the time made this possible.

There was intense competition for markets with Chicago, and to a lesser degree, with [[Racine, Wisconsin|Racine]] and [[Kenosha, Wisconsin|Kenosha]]. Eventually Chicago won out due to its superior financial and transposition status, as well as being a hub on major railroad lines throughout the United States. Milwaukee did solidify its place as the commercial capital of Wisconsin and an important market in the Midwest.<ref name="milwaukeehistory.net" />

[[File:Menomonee Valley.jpg|thumb|[[Rail tracks]] along the industrial [[Menomonee Valley]], ancestral home of the [[Menominee]] Indians]]
Because of its easy access to Lake Michigan and other waterways, Milwaukee's [[Menomonee Valley]] has historically been home to [[manufacturing]], [[Meat packing industry|stockyards]], [[Rendering (food processing)|rendering plants]], [[shipping]], and other [[heavy industry]].

Reshaping of the valley began with the [[rail transport|railroads]] built by city co-founder [[Byron Kilbourn]] to bring product from Wisconsin's farm interior to the port. By 1862 Milwaukee was the largest shipper of [[wheat]] on the planet, and related industry developed. [[Grain elevator]]s were built and, due to Milwaukee's dominant [[German American|German immigrant population]], [[Brewery|breweries]] sprang up around the processing of [[barley]] and [[hops]]. A number of [[Tanning (leather)|tanneries]] were constructed, of which the [[Pfister & Vogel]] tannery grew to become the largest in America.

In 1843 George Burnham and his brother Jonathan opened a [[brickyard]] near 16th Street. When a durable and distinct cream-colored brick came out of the clay beds, other brickyards sprang up to take advantage of this resource. Because many of the city's buildings were built using this material it earned the nickname "Cream City", and consequently the brick was called [[Cream City brick]]. By 1881 the Burnham brickyard, which employed 200 men and peaked at 15&nbsp;million bricks a year, was the largest in the world.

[[Gristmill|Flour mills]], packing plants, breweries, railways and tanneries further industrialized the valley. With the [[marsh]]lands drained and the [[Kinnickinnic River (Milwaukee River)|Kinnickinnic]] and [[Milwaukee River]]s dredged, attention turned to the valley.

Along with the processing industries, bulk commodity storage and machining and manufacturing entered the scene. The valley was home to the [[Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad|Milwaukee Road]], [[Falk Corporation]], [[Cutler-Hammer]], [[Harnischfeger Corporation]], [[Chain Belt Company]], [[Nordberg Manufacturing Company]] and other industry giants.

Early in the 20th century, Milwaukee was home to several pioneer [[brass era]] [[automobile]] makers, including Ogren (1919–1922).<ref>{{cite book |last=Clymer |first=Floyd |title=Treasury of Early American Automobiles, 1877–1925 |location=New York |publisher=Bonanza Books |year=1950 |page=153 }}</ref>

===Brewing===
{{further|Beer in Milwaukee}}

Milwaukee became synonymous with [[Germans]] and [[beer]] beginning in the 1840s. The Germans had long enjoyed beer and set up breweries when they arrived in Milwaukee. By 1856, there were more than two dozen breweries in Milwaukee, most of them owned and operated by Germans. Besides making beer for the rest of the nation, Milwaukeeans enjoyed consuming the various beers produced in the city's breweries. As early as 1843, pioneer historian [[James Buck]] recorded 138 taverns in Milwaukee, an average of one per forty residents. Today, [[beer hall]]s and taverns are abundant in the city, but only one of the major breweries—[[Miller Brewing Company|Miller]]—remains in Milwaukee.<ref name="milwaukeehistory.net">{{cite web|url=http://www.milwaukeehistory.net/milwaukee_timeline/1800s.html |title=Milwaukee County Historical Society – Milwaukee Timeline 1800s |publisher=Milwaukeehistory.net |access-date=July 2, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100610215529/http://www.milwaukeehistory.net/milwaukee_timeline/1800s.html |archive-date=June 10, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

Milwaukee was once the home to four of the world's largest beer breweries ([[Joseph Schlitz Brewing Company|Schlitz]], [[Valentin Blatz Brewing Company|Blatz]], [[Pabst Brewing Company|Pabst]], and Miller), and was the number one beer producing city in the world for many years.

The historic Milwaukee Brewery in "Miller Valley" at 4000 West State Street, is the oldest functioning major brewery in the United States. In 2008, [[Coors Brewing Company|Coors]] beer also began to be brewed in Miller Valley. This created additional brewery jobs in Milwaukee, but the company's world headquarters moved from Milwaukee to Chicago.

In addition to Miller and the heavily automated [[Jacob Leinenkugel Brewing Company|Leinenkugel's]] brewery in the old Blatz 10th Street plant, other stand-alone breweries in Milwaukee include [[Milwaukee Ale House|Milwaukee Brewing Company]], a microbrewery in [[Neighborhoods of Milwaukee#Walker's Point|Walker's Point neighborhood]]; [[Lakefront Brewery, Inc.|Lakefront Brewery]], a [[microbrewery]] in Brewers Hill; and [[Sprecher Brewery]], a German brewery that also brews craft sodas.

Three beer brewers with Wisconsin operations made the 2009 list of the 50 largest beermakers in the United States, based on beer sales volume. Making the latest big-breweries list from Wisconsin is [[MillerCoors]] at No. 2. MillerCoors is a joint venture formed in 2008 by Milwaukee-based Miller Brewing Co. and Golden, Colorado-based [[Molson Coors Brewing Company]]. The [[Joseph Huber Brewing Company|Minhas Craft Brewery]] in [[Monroe, Wisconsin]], which brews Huber, Rhinelander and Mountain Crest brands, ranked No. 14 and [[New Glarus Brewing Company]], [[New Glarus, Wisconsin]], whose brands include Spotted Cow, Fat Squirrel and Uff-da, ranked No. 32.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://milwaukee.bizjournals.com/milwaukee/stories/2009/04/13/daily23.html |title=Three state breweries make largest list – The Business Journal of Milwaukee |publisher=Milwaukee.bizjournals.com |date=April 14, 2009 |access-date=July 2, 2010}}</ref>

==Government and politics==
{{Main|Government of Milwaukee}}
{{see also|List of mayors of Milwaukee}}

Milwaukee has a [[mayor-council]] form of government. With the election of Mayor [[John Norquist|John O. Norquist]] in 1988, the city adopted a cabinet form of government with the mayor appointing those department heads not otherwise elected or appointed—notably the Fire and Police Chiefs. While this gave the mayor greater control of the day-to-day operations of the city, the Common Council retains almost complete control over the city's finances and the mayor, with the exception of his proposed annual budget, cannot directly introduce legislation. The Common Council consists of 15 members, one from each district in the city. Milwaukee has a history of giving long tenures to its mayors; from [[Frank Zeidler]] to current mayor [[Tom Barrett (Wisconsin politician)|Tom Barrett]], the city has had only four mayors in the last 60 years. When 28-year incumbent [[Henry Maier]] retired in 1988, he held the record for longest term of service for a city of Milwaukee's size.

In addition to the election of a Mayor and Common Council on the city level, Milwaukee residents elect county representatives to the [[Milwaukee County]] [[Board of Supervisors]], as well as a Milwaukee County Executive. The current [[County Executive]] is [[Chris Abele]].

Milwaukee has been a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] stronghold for more than a century at the federal level.<ref>{{cite web |last1=O’Neill |first1=Joseph |title=How Milwaukee Could Decide the Next President |url=https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/what-wins-wisconsin-milwaukee-community-organizing?source=EDT_NYR_EDIT_NEWSLETTER_0_imagenewsletter_Daily_ZZ&bxid=5be9fceb2ddf9c72dc8994b7&cndid=30462369&esrc=&mbid= |website=The New Yorker |access-date=19 February 2020 |language=en}}</ref> At the local level, [[Socialist Party of America|Socialists]] frequently won the mayorship and (for briefer periods) other city and county offices during much of the first sixty years of the 20th century. The city is split between seven state Senate districts, each of which is composed of three Assembly districts. All but four state legislators representing the city are Democrats; the four [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]]—two in the [[Wisconsin State Assembly|State Assembly]] and two in the [[Wisconsin State Senate|State Senate]]—represent outer portions of the city that are part of districts dominated by heavily Republican suburban counties. In 2008, [[Barack Obama]] won Milwaukee with 77% of the vote.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://county.milwaukee.gov/ImageLibrary/Groups/cntyElectCommission/ElectionResults/2008/11408_Canvass_Pres___Vice_Pres.pdf|title=Tabular Statement of the Votes Given for President and Vice President at a Fall General Election Held in the Several Wards, Villages and Election Districts in the County of Milwaukee on the 4th Day of November, 2008|website=County.milwaukee.gov|access-date=26 July 2018}}</ref> [[Tim Carpenter]] (D), [[Lena Taylor]] (D), [[Robyn Vining]] (R), [[LaTonya Johnson]] (D), [[Chris Larson]] (D), [[Alberta Darling]] (R), and [[Mary Lazich]] (R) represent Milwaukee in the [[Wisconsin State Senate]], and [[Daniel Riemer]] (D), [[JoCasta Zamarripa]] (D), [[Marisabel Cabrera]] (D), [[David Bowen (Wisconsin)|David Bowen]] (D), [[Jason Fields]] (D), [[LaKeshia Myers]] (D), [[Rob Hutton]] (R), [[Dale P.

Milwaukee makes up the overwhelming majority of [[Wisconsin's 4th congressional district]]. The district is heavily Democratic, with the Democratic primary often being considered [[Tantamount to election|tantamount to the election]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=256664 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20070513171703/http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=256664 |url-status=dead |archive-date=May 13, 2007 |title=Editorial: 4th Congressional District: Moore, Hoze in primaries |newspaper=Milwaukee Journal Sentinel |date=September 4, 2004 |access-date=June 1, 2016}}</ref> The district is currently represented by Democrat [[Gwen Moore]]. A Republican has not represented a significant portion of Milwaukee in Congress since [[Charles J. Kersten]] lost his seat in the [[Wisconsin's 5th congressional district|5th district]] in 1954 to Democrat [[Henry S. Reuss]]. The small portions of the city extending into Waukesha and Washington counties are part of the [[Wisconsin's 5th congressional district|5th District]], represented by Republican [[Jim Sensenbrenner]].

A Mexican Consulate is also located in Milwaukee that serves a total of 65 counties in Wisconsin and the [[Upper Peninsula of Michigan]].<ref>Tom Daykin.

* '''Commuter rail''': Milwaukee currently has no commuter rail system. Previous efforts to develop one proposed a 0.5% sales tax in [[Milwaukee County, Wisconsin|Milwaukee]], [[Racine County, Wisconsin|Racine]] and [[Kenosha County, Wisconsin|Kenosha]] counties to fund an expansion of [[Metra]]'s [[Union Pacific / North Line]] from [[Kenosha, Wisconsin|Kenosha]] to Milwaukee Intermodal Station. However, Wisconsin repealed the legislation authorizing such efforts in June 2011, and the project is now defunct.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://maps.sewrpc.org/KRMonline/ |title=KRMonline – Home |publisher=Maps.sewrpc.org |date=October 5, 2009 |access-date=May 12, 2012}}</ref>

Three of Wisconsin's [[Interstate highway]]s intersect in Milwaukee. [[Interstate 94 in Wisconsin|Interstate 94]] (I-94) comes north from Chicago to enter Milwaukee and continues west to [[Madison, Wisconsin|Madison]]. The stretch of I-94 from Seven Mile Rd. to the [[Marquette Interchange]] in Downtown Milwaukee is known as the North-South Freeway. I-94 from Downtown Milwaukee west to Wisconsin 16 is known as the East-West Freeway.

[[Interstate 43|I-43]] enters Milwaukee from [[Beloit, Wisconsin|Beloit]] in the southwest and continues north along Lake Michigan to [[Green Bay, Wisconsin|Green Bay]] via [[Sheboygan, Wisconsin|Sheboygan]] and [[Manitowoc, Wisconsin|Manitowoc]]. I-43 southwest of I-41/I-894/US 41/US 45 [[Hale Interchange]] is known as the Rock Freeway. I-43 is cosigned with I-894 East and I-41/US 41 South to I-94 is known as the Airport Freeway. At I-94, I-43 follows I-94 to the [[Marquette Interchange]]. I-43 continues north known as the North-South Freeway to Wisconsin Highway 57 near Port Washington.

Approved in 2015, [[Interstate 41]] follows I-94 north from the state line before turning west at the [[Mitchell Interchange]] to the Hale Interchange and then north to Green Bay via [[Fond du Lac, Wisconsin|Fond du Lac]], [[Oshkosh, Wisconsin|Oshkosh]] and [[Appleton, Wisconsin|Appleton]]. I-41/US 41/US 45 from the Hale Interchange to Wisconsin Hwy 145 is known as the Zoo Freeway.

Milwaukee has two auxiliary Interstate Highways, [[Interstate 894|I-894]] and [[Interstate 794|I-794]].
I-894 bypasses Downtown Milwaukee on the west and south sides of the city from the [[Zoo Interchange]] to the Mitchell Interchange. I-894 is part of the Zoo Freeway and the Airport Freeway.
I-794 extends east from the [[Marquette Interchange]] to Lake Michigan before turning south over the [[Hoan Bridge]] toward Milwaukee Mitchell International Airport, turning into [[Wisconsin Highway 794|Highway 794]] along the way. This is known as the Lake Freeway.

Milwaukee is also served by three [[United States Numbered Highways|US Highways]]. [[U.S. Route 18 in Wisconsin|U.S. Highway 18]] (US&nbsp;18) provides a link from Downtown to points west heading to [[Waukesha, Wisconsin|Waukesha]] along Wells St, 17th/16th Sts, Highland Ave, 35th St, Wisconsin Ave and Blue Mound Rd. [[U.S. Route 41 in Wisconsin|US&nbsp;41]] and [[U.S. Route 45 in Wisconsin|US&nbsp;45]] both provide north–south freeway transportation on the western side of the city. The freeway system in Milwaukee carries roughly 25% of all travel in Wisconsin.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.wpr.org/report-nearly-1-200-wisconsin-bridges-deficient-condition|title=Report: Nearly 1,200 Wisconsin Bridges In 'Deficient' Condition|date=2018-02-02|work=Wisconsin Public Radio|access-date=2018-02-05|language=en}}</ref>

====Bicycle====
[[File:Oak leaf trail milwaukee.jpg|thumb|The [[Oak Leaf Trail]] on the [[East Side, Milwaukee|East Side]] ]]

Milwaukee has over {{convert|105|mi|km}} of bicycle lanes and trails, most of which run alongside or near its rivers and Lake Michigan. The [[Oak Leaf Trail]], a multi-use recreational trail, provides bicycle trails throughout the city and county. Still pending are the creation of bicycle lanes along major commuting routes, such as the Hoan Bridge connector between downtown and the suburbs to the south. The city has also identified over {{convert|250 |mi|km}} of streets on which bike lanes will fit. It has created a plan labeling {{convert|145|mi|km}} of those as high priority for receiving bike lanes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.city.milwaukee.gov/BikeLanesandBikeRout14143.htm |title=Bike Lanes and Bike Routes |access-date=March 22, 2008 |author=City of Milwaukee |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080619065548/http://www.city.milwaukee.gov/BikeLanesandBikeRout14143.htm |archive-date=June 19, 2008 }}</ref> As part of the city's Bicycle and Pedestrian Task Force's mission to "make Milwaukee more bicycle and pedestrian friendly", over 700 bike racks have been installed throughout the city.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.city.milwaukee.gov/BicycleTaskForce3727.htm |title=Bicycle and Pedestrian Task Force |access-date=March 22, 2008 |author=City of Milwaukee |url-status=dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080511200236/http://www.city.milwaukee.gov/BicycleTaskForce3727.htm |archive-date=May 11, 2008 }}</ref> The Bicycle Federation of Wisconsin<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bfw.org/|title=Wisconsin Bike Fed|access-date=January 25, 2015|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20190518105922/http://bfw.org/|archive-date=May 18, 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref> holds an annual Bike to Work Week.

In August 2014, Milwaukee debuted a [[bicycle sharing system]] called [[Bublr Bikes]], which is a partnership between the City of Milwaukee and a local non-profit Midwest Bike Share (dba Bublr Bikes).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.biztimes.com/article/20140806/ENEWSLETTERS02/140809877 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-08-07 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808055513/http://www.biztimes.com/article/20140806/ENEWSLETTERS02/140809877 |archive-date=August 8, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://urbanmilwaukee.com/2014/08/06/eyes-on-milwaukee-bublr-bike-share-system-is-launched/|title=Eyes on Milwaukee: "Bublr" Bike Share System Is Launched|work=Urban Milwaukee}}</ref> As of September 2016, the system operates 39 stations throughout downtown, the East Side, and the UW-Milwaukee campus area and near downtown neighborhoods. The City of Milwaukee installed another ten Bublr Bikes stations in October 2016, and the adjacent suburb of [[Wauwatosa, Wisconsin|Wauwatosa]] installed eight stations in September 2016, which will bring the system size to 58 stations by the end of 2016. More stations are scheduled for installation in the Village of [[Shorewood, Wisconsin|Shorewood]] and the City of [[West Allis, Wisconsin|West Allis]] in 2017. Future system expansion in the City of Milwaukee is also expected as the City was awarded a second federal Congestion Mitigation/Air Quality (CMAQ) program grant ($1.9&nbsp;million) to add more stations starting in 2018.<ref>{{cite web|title = Station Locations|url = https://bublrbikes.bcycle.com/station-locations|website = bublrbikes.bcycle.com|access-date = 2016-02-10}}</ref>

===City development===
On February 10, 2015, a streetcar connecting the Milwaukee Intermodal Station with the city's lower east side was approved by the Common Council, bringing if not to a halt then at least to a pause, decades of sometimes acrimonious debate. On a 9–6 vote, the council approved a measure that established the project's $124&nbsp;million capital budget, its estimated $3.2&nbsp;million operating and maintenance budget and its {{Convert|2.5|mi||abbr=|adj=on}} route, which includes a lakefront spur connecting the line to the proposed $122&nbsp;million, 44-story Couture.
