"'''The Edge of Glory'''" is a song by American singer [[Lady Gaga]] from her second studio album, ''[[Born This Way (album)|Born This Way]]'' (2011). The song was released on May 9, 2011 as the album's third single. Initially released as one of two promotional singles for ''Born This Way'', it shortly became a single following its success in digital outlets worldwide. The song was written and produced by Gaga and [[Fernando Garibay]], and is a [[Pop music|pop]], [[Electronic rock|electro-rock]], and [[disco]] song that speaks of the last moments of life.<ref name="bmi">{{cite web|url=http://repertoire.bmi.com/title.asp?blnWriter=True&blnPublisher=True&blnArtist=True&keyID=12871270&ShowNbr=0&ShowSeqNbr=0&querytype=WorkID|title=Edge of Glory (Legal Title)&nbsp;– BMI Work #12871270|access-date=May 21, 2011|publisher=[[Broadcast Music Incorporated]].

Alongside a [[saxophone]] solo played by [[Clarence Clemons]], the melody of the song resembles much of the musical works of [[Bruce Springsteen]], and contains several qualities similar to that of 1980s adult contemporary musical works.

"The Edge of Glory" received critical acclaim, with many reviewers deeming it as an album highlight. Much of the praise went to the song's chorus and the musical production. Reviewers also complimented Gaga's vocals, describing it as "soulful". The song was a commercial success worldwide, charting in the top ten in several major music markets, including Australia, Belgium, Canada, New Zealand, Norway, Spain and the United Kingdom. In the United States, it peaked at number three on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], becoming Gaga's tenth consecutive top-ten single in the United States.

A music video for the song was filmed in late May, co-directed by the singer and her production team, Haus of Gaga. The video is simple in contrast to much of Gaga's previous work, and portrays her dancing on a fire-escape and walking on a lonely street. Differences include the lack of intricate choreography and back-up dancers, as well as using only one outfit designed by [[Versace]]. Critics lauded the simplicity of the video, while comparing it to the works of [[Michael Jackson]], [[Janet Jackson]] and [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]. Live performances of the song include the [[American Idol (season 10)|tenth season of ''American Idol'']], the [[2011 MuchMusic Video Awards]], ''[[Good Morning America]]''{{'}}s "Summer Concert Series", and many of the singer's concert tours.

<blockquote>
"['The Edge of Glory'] was about how when my grandma was standing over my grandfather while he was dying. There was this moment where I felt like he had sort of looked at her and reckoned that he had won in life. Like, 'I'm a champion. We won. Our love made us a winner.' They were married 60 years. I thought about that idea, that the glorious moment of your life is when you decide that it's okay to go, you don’t have any more words to say, more business, more mountains to climb. You're on the cliff, you tip your hat to yourself and you go. That’s what it was for me in that moment when I witnessed it."<ref name="freedom"/>

More information in regards to "The Edge of Glory" was revealed by Gaga, in an interview with [[Google]] where she explained the song as being about one's final moments on Earth, before death.<ref name="google">{{cite AV media|title=Google Goes Gaga|medium=Transcription|time=25:36|quote="One of the songs, 'Edge of Glory', was inspired by my grandfather...|people=[[Lady Gaga]]|publisher=[[Google]]|date=March 13, 2011|location=New York}}</ref><ref name=rollingstone>{{Cite news|last=Perpetua|first=Matthew|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/preview-six-songs-from-lady-gagas-born-this-way-20110218|title=Preview Six Songs From Lady Gaga's "Born This Way"|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=February 18, 2011|access-date=February 20, 2011|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110223163431/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/preview-six-songs-from-lady-gagas-born-this-way-20110218|archive-date=February 23, 2011}}</ref> Another inspiration for the song was actor [[Sylvester Stallone]]'s 1976 film ''[[Rocky]]'', which is Gaga's favorite film.

==Critical reception==
The Edge of Glory was met with general acclaim from critics. While previewing the song Matthew Perpetua from ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' wrote a positive review: "This one sounds crazy in print [...], but somehow it all seems totally natural when you actually hear it." Perpetua added that there is an element of cheesiness in the song, but nevertheless, it is captivating and catchy when one listens to it.

===Background===
[[File:NYC - Buildings with fire exit ladders - 0200.jpg|thumb|upright|The video featured Gaga dancing outside a [[fire escape]], reminiscent of her early days in New York City.]]
At the [[Broadcast Music Incorporated|BMI Pop Music Awards]], Gaga's choreographer [[Laurieann Gibson]] said that they would be filming the [[music video]] for "The Edge of Glory" soon. While she did not reveal much about the music video concept, she added: "I just know that we'll be feeling very fishy."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.rap-up.com/2011/05/18/lady-gaga-preps-edge-of-glory-video-shoots-google-commercial/|title=Lady Gaga Preps 'Edge Of Glory' Video, Shoots Google Commercial|date=May 18, 2011|access-date=May 18, 2011|work=[[Rap-Up]]|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110521022110/http://www.rap-up.com/2011/05/18/lady-gaga-preps-edge-of-glory-video-shoots-google-commercial/|archive-date=May 21, 2011}}</ref> Gaga told [[MTV (UK and Ireland)|MTV UK]] that she had already written the treatment for the video, adding that it's her favorite.<ref name="mtvuk"/> [[E!

Other roles included a male or female on-air reporter, a doctor role reminiscent to the one in the American show ''[[Dr. 90210]]'', and a group of military men for scenes involving rifles.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1664635/lady-gaga-edge-of-glory-video.jhtml|title=Lady Gaga's "Edge Of Glory" Video Details Possibly Revealed|last=Vena|first=Jocelyn|date=May 26, 2011|access-date=May 29, 2011|publisher=MTV News|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110529002509/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1664635/lady-gaga-edge-of-glory-video.jhtml|archive-date=May 29, 2011}}</ref> The music video director was confirmed as [[Joseph Kahn]], but Interscope Records later confirmed that Kahn and Gaga parted ways due to collaborative misunderstandings. Gibson confirmed that there was "some issues on the set", which resulted in Kahn being replaced as the director.<ref>{{cite news|last=Vena|first=Jocelyn|date=June 17, 2011|access-date=June 17, 2011|publisher=MTV News|title=Lady GaGa 'Had Issues' With New Video Director|url=http://www.mtv.co.uk/artists/lady-gaga/news/277562-lady-gaga-the-edge-of-glory-joseph-kahn-twitter|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110619043741/http://www.mtv.co.uk/artists/lady-gaga/news/277562-lady-gaga-the-edge-of-glory-joseph-kahn-twitter|archive-date=June 19, 2011}}</ref>

Gaga's creative team Haus of Gaga were later chosen to direct the video instead. Chancler Haynes, Kahn's on-set editor revealed that the mermaid-themed performance of the song, on ''[[Le Grand Journal (Canal+)|Le Grand Journal]]'' was the actual theme of the video, and included sets built for a hospital scene, Brooklyn Bridge, and a big underwater mermaid scene.<ref name="nypostvideo"/> However, at the last minute before shooting, Gaga changed her mind regarding the whole concept, leading to a disagreement with Kahn, and hence it was cancelled. She then shot the scenes with [[Clarence Clemons]] in a New York City set.<ref name="nypostvideo"/> She later explained that her idea was to create a "sweater set of a video". She wanted to acknowledge herself and the success she had experienced in her music career, with a simplified video showing her dancing outside her New York apartment from her early days.<ref>{{cite AV media|people=Lady Gaga|title=Lady Gaga – Press conference – ''Born This Way''|date=July 9, 2011|format=Digital download|time=4:22|location=Singapore|medium=Transcoding}}</ref> The music video premiered on June 16, 2011, on the [[So You Think You Can Dance (season 8)|eighth season]] of US reality television show, ''[[So You Think You Can Dance (American TV series)|So You Think You Can Dance]]''.<ref>{{cite news|title=Lady Gaga To Premiere 'Edge Of Glory' Video On "So You Think You Can Danc"|last=Vena|first=Jocelyn|date=June 15, 2011|access-date=June 15, 2011|publisher=MTV News|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1665785/lady-gaga-edge-of-glory-video-sytycd.jhtml|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110616233421/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1665785/lady-gaga-edge-of-glory-video-sytycd.jhtml|archive-date=June 16, 2011}}</ref>

===Synopsis===
Gaga's wardrobe throughout the entire video primarily consists of only one outfit which was designed by [[Gianni Versace]]. The dress consists of a [[sadomasochism|S&M]]-inspired outfit, with heavy gold jewelry, studs on the leather, and vibrant nail polish and lipstick. Notable in the video is the absence of back-up dancers, elaborate choreography, or a symbolic plot: components that have all been predominant in Gaga's other music videos. Aside from Gaga herself, Clemons is the only other person to appear in the video.<ref name="slant-video"/>

The video begins with Gaga slowly appearing from behind a building on a deserted street corner. The whole scenario is bathed in red and violet lights, coming from the windows of the buildings and alleyways as steam billows out from the drains. When the first verse of the song begins, Gaga emerges from the window of an apartment onto the fire escape. A long take follows, of Gaga strutting through the red-lit district singing the line "I got a reason that you should take me home tonight", and a shock of black hair falls in her eyes. Gaga does not remove it and the shot spans to her walking backside, gesturing the viewer to follow.<ref name="slant-video"/> The video consists mostly of interchanging shots of Gaga dancing and singing on the street, on the fire escape, and on the steps in front of the apartment building with Clemons. Near the end of the video, after Clemons' saxophone solo, Gaga crouches in front of the building's steps and kisses the sidewalk. The video concludes with a close-up of Gaga's face, before she re-enters through the window into her smokey apartment.

}}
Both Jocelyn Vena from MTV and Christian Blauvelt from ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' commented on the similarity of the music video with the Broadway musical, ''[[Rent (musical)|Rent]]''.<ref name="mtvvideo"/> Vena also compared the visuals with those for [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]'s 1986 single "[[Papa Don't Preach]]" and [[Michael Jackson]]'s 1984 single, "[[Billie Jean]]". She concluded by saying that the music video "still manages to shine, mostly because of its simplicity".<ref name="mtvvideo">{{cite news|title=Lady Gaga's "Edge Of Glory" Video: Glory Days|last=Vena|first=Jocelyn|date=June 17, 2011|access-date=June 17, 2011|publisher=MTV News|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1665952/lady-gaga-edge-of-glory-video.jhtml|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110619215921/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1665952/lady-gaga-edge-of-glory-video.jhtml|archive-date=June 19, 2011}}</ref> In another review, James Montgomery from MTV, also found similarities between the video and the musicals ''Rent'' and ''[[West Side Story]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1665991/lady-gaga-edge-of-glory.jhtml|title=Lady Gaga's "Edge Of Glory": A Pop-Culture Cheat Sheet|first=James|last=Montgomery|date=June 17, 2011|access-date=June 17, 2011|publisher=MTV News|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110619214650/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1665991/lady-gaga-edge-of-glory.jhtml|archive-date=June 19, 2011}}</ref> Blauvelt was initially surprised to see the simplistic approach of the video, since her previous releases had provocative visuals. He added that the video seemed a "clear homage" to Gaga's inspirations like Madonna, concluding that "all the references in 'The Edge of Glory' are so overt, there's no way it could be shameless cribbing."<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://music-mix.ew.com/2011/06/16/lady-gaga-edge-of-glory-video-debut/|title=Lady Gaga debuts 'Edge of Glory' video: Watch her one-woman '80s time-warp fantasia here|last=Blauvelt|first=Christian|date=June 16, 2011|access-date=June 17, 2011|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110618023506/http://music-mix.ew.com/2011/06/16/lady-gaga-edge-of-glory-video-debut/|archive-date=June 18, 2011}}</ref>

Sal Cinquemani of ''Slant Magazine'' gave the video a positive review, calling it a "visual triumph", with "breathtaking" art direction, and a "gray-blue-black color palette carefully calibrated by Gaga's vibrant lipstick and nail polish, a red painted stripe on the curb, and the gold of her jewelry and the studs on her leather, not to mention Clarence Clemons's brass." The video was compared to Michael Jackson's "[[The Way You Make Me Feel]]," [[Janet Jackson]]'s "[[When I Think of You]]" and "[[The Pleasure Principle (song)|The Pleasure Principle]]", and the film, ''[[Crimes of Passion (1984 film)|Crimes of Passion]]'', all of them being 1980s videos and films. He did, however, criticize Gaga's "half-convincing" lip-synching.<ref name="slant-video">{{cite web|url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/house/2011/06/video-review-lady-gaga-the-edge-of-glory/|title=Video Review: Lady Gaga, "The Edge of Glory"|first=Sal|last=Cinquemani|date=June 17, 2011|access-date=June 17, 2011|work=Slant Magazine|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110619201613/http://www.slantmagazine.com/house/2011/06/video-review-lady-gaga-the-edge-of-glory/|archive-date=June 19, 2011}}</ref> Writing for ''The Washington Post'', Sarah Anne Hughes called the video "shockingly simple".<ref name=washpost>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/celebritology/post/lady-gagas-the-edge-of-glory-video-is-shockingly-simple/2011/06/17/AGpy9kYH_blog.html|title=Lady Gaga's "The Edge of Glory" video is shockingly simple|first=Sarah Anne|last=Hughes|date=June 17, 2011|access-date=June 17, 2011|work=[[The Washington Post]]|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112090635/http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/celebritology/post/lady-gagas-the-edge-of-glory-video-is-shockingly-simple/2011/06/17/AGpy9kYH_blog.html|archive-date=January 12, 2012}}</ref> Amos Barshad from ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' liked the straight approach Gaga took with the video, and although he called it boring compared to Gaga's previous efforts, he felt the video worked well because of the simplicity.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://nymag.com/daily/entertainment/2011/06/lady_gagas_bizarrely_straightf.html|title=Lady Gaga's Bizarrely Straightforward "Edge of Glory" Video Is Here|last=Barshad|first=Amos|date=June 18, 2011|access-date=June 18, 2011|work=[[New York (magazine)|New York]]|publisher=New York Media LLC|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110618142058/http://nymag.com/daily/entertainment/2011/06/lady_gagas_bizarrely_straightf.html|archive-date=June 18, 2011}}</ref>

Jarett Wieselman from ''New York Post'' tried to understand what actually went wrong with the production, and came to the conclusion that the mutual disagreements between Gaga and Kahn led to the video being a "piece of rubbish". He deemed the whole issue surrounding the production as "foolish", in the end agreeing that "it was foolish of us to expect that GaGa would never stumble because, despite the preternatural image constantly presented, she is only human after all."<ref name="nypostvideo">{{Cite news|url=http://www.nypost.com/p/blogs/popwrap/what_went_wrong_with_gaga_edge_of_wmc2lz5GRCoX6OoFiTbr4O|title=What went wrong with GaGa's "Edge of Glory" video?|last=Wieselman|first=Jarett|date=June 17, 2011|access-date=June 17, 2011|work=New York Post|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110619000818/http://www.nypost.com/p/blogs/popwrap/what_went_wrong_with_gaga_edge_of_wmc2lz5GRCoX6OoFiTbr4O|archive-date=June 19, 2011}}</ref> ''Rolling Stone''{{'}}s Daniel Kreps gave a mixed review of the video, calling the song "over-the-top" with a "lackluster" and "understated" video.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/videos/new-and-hot/lady-gaga-and-clarence-clemons-lackluster-video-for-edge-of-glory-20110617|title=Lady Gaga and Clarence Clemons: Lackluster video for "Edge of Glory"|date=June 17, 2011|access-date=June 17, 2011|work=Rolling Stone|last=Kreps|first=Daniel|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110620093638/http://www.rollingstone.com/videos/new-and-hot/lady-gaga-and-clarence-clemons-lackluster-video-for-edge-of-glory-20110617|archive-date=June 20, 2011}}</ref> ''[[Dose (magazine)|Dose]]''{{'}}s Leah Collins was more neutral in her review, questioning if Gaga was simply "swooning with nostalgia for other pop culture nuggets that have featured the same NYC backdrop of fire escapes and brown-stone steps" or just attempting to "be saving a metric buttload on the budget".<ref name="Dose">{{cite news|url=http://www.dose.ca/Watch+Lady+Gaga+Edge+Glory+Video+Stripped+Down+Messed/4964046/story.html|title=Watch Lady Gaga's "Edge of Glory" Video|first=Leah|last=Collins|date=June 17, 2011|access-date=June 17, 2011|work=[[Dose (magazine)|Dose]]|publisher=[[Postmedia Network]]|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/5zWumEUiw?url=http://www.dose.ca/Watch+Lady+Gaga+Edge+Glory+Video+Stripped+Down+Messed/4964046/story.html|archive-date=June 18, 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> While reviewing the video for ''[[The Vancouver Sun]]'', Collins compared Gaga's look in the video to a "hooker" from the 1982 American [[science fiction]] film, ''[[Blade Runner]]''.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://vancouversun.com/Gaga+pushes+retro+style+Edge/4969386/story.html|title=Gaga pushes retro style to The Edge|first=Leah|last=Collins|date=June 17, 2011|access-date=June 17, 2011|work=[[The Vancouver Sun]]|publisher=[[Postmedia Network]]|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/5zWugI9Nt?url=http://www.vancouversun.com/Gaga+pushes+retro+style+Edge/4969386/story.html|archive-date=June 18, 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref>
