The '''Brazilian Miracle''' ({{Lang-pt|milagre econômico brasileiro|links=no}}) was a period of exceptional economic growth in Brazil during the rule of the [[Brazilian military government]]. During this time the average annual GDP growth was close to 10%. The greatest economic growth was reached during the tenure of President [[Emílio Garrastazu Médici]] from 1969 to 1973.

Perception of the so-called ''Golden Age'' of Brazilian development was strengthened in 1970, when Brazil for the third time won the [[1970 FIFA World Cup|FIFA World Cup]], and the official adoption of the slogan "''Brasil, ame-o ou deixe-o''" ("Brazil, love it or leave it") by the Brazilian military government.

==Background==
During the presidency of [[João Goulart]], the economy was nearing a crisis, and the annual [[inflation]] rate reached 100%. After the [[1964 Brazilian coup d'état|1964 coup d'état]], the Brazilian military was more concerned with political control and left economic policy to a group of entrusted technocrats, led by [[Delfim Netto]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1975/06/08/archives/flying-high-in-rio-brazil.html|title=Plying High in Rio|last=Handler|first=Bruce|date=1975-06-08|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-04-18|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>

Brazil became an urban society, with 67% of its people living in cities. That was caused by a population shift from the poorer countryside to the booming cities, with [[São Paulo]] growing faster than the others.<ref>[https://www.insightguides.com/destinations/south-america/brazil/cultural-features/19681980-the-brazilian-miracle 1968–1980: the 'Brazilian Miracle']</ref>

==Successes==
The government became directly involved in the economy, as it invested heavily in new highways, bridges, and railroads. Steel mills, petrochemical factories, hydroelectric power plants, and nuclear reactors were built by the large state-owned companies [[Eletrobras]] and [[Petrobras]]. To reduce the dependency on imported oil, [[history of ethanol fuel in Brazil|ethanol industry]] was heavily promoted.

By 1980, 57% of Brazil's exports were industrial goods, compared with 20% in 1968.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K0Iv9CK1BIoC&q=brazilian+miracle&pg=PA95|title=Globalization, Urbanization, and the State: Selected Studies on Contemporary Latin America|last=Pattnayak|first=Satya R.|date=1996|publisher=University Press of America|isbn=9780761803539|language=en}}</ref>

In this period, the annual GDP growth rate jumped from 9.8% per year in 1968 to 14% in 1973 and inflation rose from 19.46% in 1968 to 34.55% in 1974.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Economia Brasileira Contemporânea|others=Giambiagi, Fabio,, Castro, Lavinia Barros de,, Hermann, Jennifer,, Villela, André|isbn=9788535238556|edition=[3. ed.]|location=Rio de Janeiro, Brasil|oclc=1049153964|date = 2017-04-13}}</ref>

==Problems==
To fuel its economic growth, Brazil needed more and more imported oil. The early years of the Brazilian Miracle had sustainable growth and borrowing. However, the [[1973 oil crisis]] made the military government increasingly borrow from international lenders, and the debt became unmanageable. By the end of the decade, Brazil had the largest debt in the world: about $US92 billion.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/11/26/business/brazil-s-economic-miracle-and-its-collapse.html|title=Brazil's Economic 'Miracle' and Its Collapse|last1=Kilborn|first1=Peter T.|date=1983-11-26|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-04-17|last2=Times|first2=Special to The New York|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>

Economic growth definitely ended with the [[1979 energy crisis]], which led to years of [[recession]] and [[hyperinflation in Brazil|hyperinflation]].
