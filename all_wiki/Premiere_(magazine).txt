'''''Premiere''''' was an [[United States|American]] film magazine based in [[New York City]] and published by [[Hachette Filipacchi Media U.S.]] between 1987 and 2010. The original version of the magazine, ''Première'', was established in France in 1976 and continues to be published there.

==History==
The French film magazine ''Première'' was launched in November 1976 by Jean-Pierre Frimbois and [[Marc Esposito]] and originally published by the [[Lagardère Group]]. From 2016, it has been published by Hildegarde.

The U.S. version of the magazine was launched in the United States with a July/August 1987 edition featuring [[Dan Aykroyd]] and [[Tom Hanks]] from ''[[Dragnet (1987 film)|Dragnet]]'' (1987) on the front cover. Their mission was to "reflect The Second Golden Age of the Movies".<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=Premiere|date=Autumn 1992|pages=70–79|title=The Very Best of Premiere}}</ref> The magazine originally had offices in [[New York City]] and [[Los Angeles]] and was published by [[Rupert Murdoch]]. The founding editor was [[Susan Lyne]]. Among those working for the magazine was [[Peter Biskind]], who spent a decade at the magazine as executive editor, later writing the film history ''[[Easy Riders, Raging Bulls]]''. He said that, early on, the magazine "gave us a lot of freedom to do hard-hitting, in-depth reporting."<ref name="LA">{{cite news | last = Welkos | first = Robert W. | title = Premiere magazine goes from 'it' read to has-been | work =[[Los Angeles Times]] | date = March 10, 2007 | url = http://articles.latimes.com/2007/mar/10/entertainment/et-premiere10 | accessdate=January 4, 2013}}</ref><ref name="renegade">{{cite news |date=April 6, 1998 |first=Robin |last=Pogrebin |title=Once a Renegade, Hachette Magazine Chief Gains Respect |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/04/06/business/once-a-renegade-hachette-magazine-chief-gains-respect.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |quote=The integrity of Mr. Pecker's various ventures has been questioned over the years, particularly after he killed an article for ''Premiere'' on behalf of the Revlon executive Ronald O.

Perelman was planning a venture with the restaurant at the time. Premiere's two top editors resigned over the incident.}}</ref>

Critic [[Glenn Kenny]] joined the staff in June 1996,<ref name="rockcriticsarchives.com">"[http://rockcriticsarchives.com/interviews/glennkenny/01.html Interview with Glenn Kenny]," ''rockcriticsarchives.com'', accessed February 19, 2017.</ref> and served as a critic and later as senior editor until it ceased publication.

[[News Corporation (1980–2013)|News Corporation]] sold the magazine to [[K-III]] (later Primedia) in 1991, and [[Hachette Filipacchi Media U.S.|Hachette]] reacquired the magazine in 1995. After Lyne left the magazine, [[Chris Connelly (journalist)|Chris Connelly]] became editor-in-chief in early 1996, while Nancy Griffin served as deputy editor. Both editors resigned suddenly in May of the same year after publisher Hachette Filipacchi's then president and chief executive, [[David Pecker]], told Connelly to not publish a column about [[Planet Hollywood]] because of its ties to billionaire [[Revlon]] owner [[Ronald Perelman]], who was also half-owner of ''Premiere''.<ref name="LA" /> James B. Meigs was listed as the editor-in-chief from the August 1996 issue.<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=Premiere|date=January 1999|title=Premiere|page=12}}</ref>

''Premiere's'' editor, Peter Herbst, was appointed senior vice president and group editorial director for Hachette Filipacchi Media U.S. in 2002. From 1995 to 2000, Herbst was editor-in-chief of ''[[Family Life (Wenner Media magazine)|Family Life]]'' magazine.

===Cancellation===
On March 5, 2007, publisher Hachette Filipacchi Media U.S. announced that it was shutting down the U.S. print edition of ''Premiere'' and that the magazine would survive as an online-only publication.

The last published issue was released in April 2007 and featured ''[[Blades of Glory]]'' star [[Will Ferrell]] on its cover. The final issue gave readers no warning that it would be the last. In late April, subscribers were mailed postcards advising them of the magazine's demise and telling them the balance of their subscriptions would be fulfilled with issues of the [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] [[gossip magazine]] ''[[Us Weekly]]''. Unhappy subscribers responded to the offer by posting negative comments on the magazine website's forum pages, and it was later announced that a cash refund would be made available for those who preferred one.

The online version only lasted for a few years, as the magazine's subscribers showed little interest in its new incarnation, and the magazine ceased all operations in 2010.

===Other international editions===
====Japan====
A Japanese edition was launched in 1990, published by [[Kadokawa Shoten]].

====UK====
In September 1992, a UK edition was released, published by [[Emap]] Metro and edited by [[Barry McIlheney]].<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=Premiere|date=Autumn 1992|page=9|title=Special Launch Issue}}</ref>

The February 1998 U.S. edition published in the United Kingdom incorporated a special UK film section.<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=Premiere|date=February 1998|pages=UK1-UK16|title=Over Here}}</ref> By the October 1998 edition, this was published as a separate supplement but had ceased by January 1999.<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=Premiere|date=October 1998|pages=UK1-UK20|title=Over Here}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=Premiere|date=January 1999|title=Premiere}}</ref>
