"'''We Are the World 25 for Haiti'''" is a [[charity single]] recorded by the [[supergroup (music)|supergroup]] Artists for Haiti in 2010. It is a remake of the 1985 hit song "[[We Are the World]]", which was written by American musicians [[Michael Jackson]] and [[Lionel Richie]], and was recorded by [[USA for Africa]] to benefit famine relief in Africa. Initially, in late 2009, it had been suggested to Richie and [[Quincy Jones]]—producer of the original "We Are the World"—that a re-cut version of the song be re-released under the title "Live 25". Following the [[moment magnitude scale|magnitude 7.0 M<sub>w</sub>]] [[2010 Haiti earthquake|earthquake]] in Haiti, which devastated the area and killed thousands of people, it was agreed that the song would be re-recorded by new artists, in the hope that it would reach a new generation and help benefit the people of Haiti.

The song was recorded in fourteen and a half hours by over eighty artists on February 1, 2010. It was produced by Quincy Jones, and executively produced by Lionel Richie, and [[Haitian Americans|Haitian-American]] musician [[Wyclef Jean]]. A music video directed by [[Paul Haggis]] was released to accompany and promote the song. The song was also recorded in Spanish by a Latin supergroup and was named [[Somos El Mundo 25 Por Haiti|Somos el Mundo]]. The song was directed by [[Emilio Estefan]] and his wife, [[Gloria Estefan]].

"We Are the World 25 for Haiti" is musically structured similar to "We Are the World", but includes a rap verse which was written by some of the song's [[hip hop]] artists. [[Michael Jackson]] [[death of Michael Jackson|died]] months before the song's release, but his material from the 1985 recording sessions was incorporated into the song and music video, as per the request of his mother, [[Katherine Jackson|Katherine]]. His sister [[Janet Jackson|Janet]] duets with him on the song, and his nephews Taj, TJ, and Taryll—collectively known as [[3T]]—feature on the track's chorus.

"We Are the World 25 for Haiti" was released on February 12, 2010, during the [[2010 Winter Olympics opening ceremony|opening ceremony of the 2010 Winter Olympics]], as a CD single and a music download. The song was critically panned by contemporary music reviewers, with criticism focused on the song's new musical additions, as well as the choice of artists who appear on the track. However, the song was commercially successful worldwide, charting within the top 20 in multiple countries.

== Background ==
{{main|We Are the World|2010 Haiti earthquake}}
In 1985, "[[We Are the World]]", a song and charity single originally recorded by [[USA for Africa]] was released. It was written by American musicians Michael Jackson and Lionel Richie, and produced by [[Quincy Jones]] and [[Michael Omartian]] for the album ''[[We Are the World (album)|We Are the World]]''. The song was well received by music critics and was the recipient of several awards. The song was a worldwide commercial success, as it topped music charts throughout the world and became the fastest-selling American pop single in history, as well as the first single to be certified multi-platinum by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]]. "We Are the World" was the best selling pop single of all time until it was eclipsed by [[Elton John]]'s [[Candle in the Wind 1997|1997 version]] of "[[Candle in the Wind]]".<ref name="1985sales">{{cite web |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/17854116.html?dids=17854116:17854116&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Oct+12%2C+1997&author=ANNE+BEATTS&pub=Los+Angeles+Times&desc=If+It's+a+Hit%2C+Why+Stop+There%3F&pqatl=google|title=If It's a Hit, Why Stop There? |first=Anne|last=Beatts |date=October 1, 1997|work=[[Los Angeles Times|LATimes.com]] |publisher=[[Tribune Company]] |accessdate=February 16, 2010}}</ref>
