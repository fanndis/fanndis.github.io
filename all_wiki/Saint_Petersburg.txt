In modern times, the city has the nickname of the "Northern Capital", and has the largest urban economy in Northern Europe, serving as a home to some federal government bodies such as the [[Constitutional Court of Russia]] and the [[Heraldic Council of the President of the Russian Federation]]. It is also a seat for the [[National Library of Russia]] and a planned location for the [[Supreme Court of Russia]], as well as the home to the headquarters of the [[Russian Navy]], and the [[Western Military District]] of the [[Russian Armed Forces]].

==Etymology==
A proponent of [[Westernization|westernising]] Russia, [[Peter the Great]], who established the city, originally named it '''Sankt-Pieter-Burch''' (Сан(к)т-Питер-Бурхъ) in Dutch manner and later its spelling was standardised as Sankt-Peterburg (Санкт-Петербургъ{{efn|name=orth|In the [[Reforms of Russian orthography#The post-revolution reform|pre-1918 Russian orthography]], these names were spelled {{lang|ru|Санктпетербург'''ъ'''}} and {{lang|ru|Петроград'''ъ'''}} with a trailing [[hard sign]].}}) under German influence.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/06/13/world/leningrad-petersburg-and-the-great-name-debate.html|title=Leningrad, Petersburg and the Great Name Debate|first=Serge|last=Schmemann}}</ref> (The Russian name lacks the letter ''s'' between ''Peter'' and ''burg''.)  On 1 September 1914, after the outbreak of [[World War I]], the Imperial government renamed the city '''Petrograd''' ({{lang-rus|links=no|Петроград{{efn|name=orth}}|p=pʲɪtrɐˈgrat}}),<ref name="vokrugsveta.ru">{{cite web|url=http://www.vokrugsveta.ru/encyclopedia/?title=%D0%9F%D0%B5%D1%82%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B3%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%B4|title=Петроград – Энциклопедия "Вокруг света"|website=www.vokrugsveta.ru}}</ref> meaning "Peter's city", in order to expunge the German words ''[[wikt:Sankt#German|Sankt]]'' and ''[[wikt:Burg#German|Burg]]''. On 26 January 1924, shortly after the death of [[Vladimir Lenin]], it was renamed to '''Leningrad''' ({{lang-rus|links=no|Ленинград|p=lʲɪnʲɪnˈgrat}}), meaning "Lenin's City". On 6 September 1991, the original name, Sankt-Peterburg, was returned by citywide referendum. Today, in English the city is known as "Saint Petersburg". Local residents often refer to the city by its shortened nickname, '''Piter''' ({{lang-rus|links=no|Питер|p=ˈpʲitʲɪr}}).

The city's traditional nicknames among Russians are the ''Window to the West'' and the ''Window to Europe''. The [[List of northernmost items|northernmost metropolis]] in the world, St. Petersburg is often called the ''[[Venice]] of the North'' or ''Russian Venice'' due to its many water corridors, as the city is built on swamp and water. Furthermore, St. Petersburg has strongly Western European-inspired architecture and culture, which is combined with the city's Russian heritage.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ecstudyabroad.net/stpetersburg/|title=St. Petersburg {{!}} European Council|language=en-US|access-date=15 April 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.russlanderleben.de/de/display_tour/discover_the_beauty_of_the_russian_venice.html|title=Entdecken Sie die Schönheit des Russischen Venedig - St. Petersburg (CB-02)}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.autentic-distribution.com/68/pid/255/Winter-in-St-Petersburg.htm|title=Winter in St. Petersburg|website=www.autentic-distribution.com|access-date=18 April 2019}}</ref> Another nickname of St. Petersburg is ''The City of White'' ''Nights'' because of a natural phenomenon which arises due to the closeness to the [[Polar regions of Earth|polar region]] and ensures that in summer the nights of the city do not get completely dark for a month.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Saint Petersburg : the city of the white nights|last=Doka, Konstantin Afanasʹevich.|date=1997|publisher=P-2 Art Publishers|others=Doka, Natalʹi︠a︡ Aleksandrovna., Vesnin, Sergeĭ., Williams, Paul.|isbn=5890910310|location=St. Petersburg|oclc=644640534}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://designcollector.net/likes/the-city-of-white-nights-saint-petersburg|title=The City of White Nights - Saint Petersburg|website=Designcollector|language=en-GB|access-date=13 June 2019}}</ref>

==History==
{{Main|History of Saint Petersburg|Timeline of Saint Petersburg}}

===Imperial era (1703–1917)===
[[File:Bronze Horseman 02.jpg|thumb|The ''[[Bronze Horseman]]'', monument to Peter the Great]]

Swedish colonists built [[Nyenschantz|Nyenskans]], a fortress at the mouth of the [[Neva]] River in 1611, in what was then called [[Ingria|Ingermanland]], which was inhabited by [[Baltic Finnic peoples|Finnic]] tribe of [[Ingrian Finns|Ingrians]]. The small town of Nyen grew up around it.

At the end of the 17th century, Peter the Great, who was interested in seafaring and maritime affairs, wanted Russia to gain a seaport to trade with the rest of Europe.<ref name="wilson82">{{cite book |title=Peter the Great |last=Wilson |first=Derek |publisher=Macmillan |isbn= 978-1429964678|page=82 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N-K6Fp445CIC&q=maritime&pg=PA150 |access-date=25 February 2012 |date=2010}}</ref> He needed a better seaport than the country's main one at the time, [[Arkhangelsk]], which was on the [[White Sea]] in the far north and closed to shipping during the winter.

The city was built by [[Serfdom|conscripted peasants]] from all over Russia; a number of Swedish [[Prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] were also involved in some years under the supervision of [[Alexander Danilovich Menshikov|Alexander Menshikov]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.swedenabroad.com/Page____41937.aspx |title=Consulate General of Sweden – Sweden and Saint Petersburg |publisher=Swedenabroad.com |date=17 October 2005 |access-date=6 January 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090108171800/http://www.swedenabroad.com/Page____41937.aspx |archive-date=8 January 2009  }}</ref> Tens of thousands of serfs died building the city.<ref>[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/st-petersburg-paris-of-the-north-or-city-of-bones-407069.html "St Petersburg: Paris of the North or City of Bones?"], ''The Independent''. 8 July 2006 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120120215411/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/st-petersburg-paris-of-the-north-or-city-of-bones-407069.html |date=20 January 2012 }}</ref> Later, the city became the centre of the [[Saint Petersburg Governorate]]. Peter moved the capital from Moscow to Saint Petersburg in 1712, 9 years before the [[Treaty of Nystad]] of 1721 ended the war; he referred to Saint Petersburg as the capital (or seat of government) as early as 1704.<ref name="wilson82"/>

[[File:Map spb 1744 high.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Map of Saint Petersburg, 1744]]
During its first few years, the city developed around Trinity Square on the right bank of the Neva, near the Peter and Paul Fortress. However, Saint Petersburg soon started to be built out according to a plan. By 1716 the [[Swiss Italian]] [[Domenico Trezzini]] had elaborated a project whereby the city centre would be on [[Vasilyevsky Island]] and shaped by a rectangular grid of canals. The project was not completed but is evident in the layout of the streets. In 1716, Peter the Great appointed Frenchman [[Jean-Baptiste Alexandre Le Blond]] as the [[Architecture|chief architect]] of Saint Petersburg.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.saint-petersburg.com/famous-people/jean-baptiste-le-blond/|title=Jean-Baptiste Le Blond, architect in St.&nbsp;Petersburg, Russia |publisher=saint-petersburg.com}}</ref>

The style of [[Petrine Baroque]], developed by Trezzini and other architects and exemplified by such buildings as the [[Menshikov Palace (Saint Petersburg)|Menshikov Palace]], [[Kunstkamera]], [[Saints Peter and Paul Cathedral, Saint Petersburg|Peter and Paul Cathedral]], [[Twelve Collegia]], became prominent in the city architecture of the early 18th century. In 1724 the [[Russian Academy of Sciences|Academy of Sciences]], [[Saint Petersburg State University|University]] and Academic Gymnasium were established in Saint Petersburg by Peter the Great.

In 1725, Peter died at age fifty-two. His endeavours to modernize Russia had met with opposition from the [[Russian nobility]]—resulting in several attempts on his life and a treason case involving his son.<ref>Matthew S. Anderson, ''Peter the Great'' (London: [[Thames & Hudson|Thames and Hudson]], 1978)</ref> In 1728, [[Peter II of Russia]] moved his seat back to Moscow. But four years later, in 1732, under Empress [[Anna of Russia]], Saint Petersburg was again designated as the capital of the [[Russian Empire]]. It remained the seat of the [[House of Romanov|Romanov dynasty]] and the Imperial Court of the [[List of Russian monarchs|Russian Tsars]], as well as the seat of the Russian government, for another 186 years until the [[Russian Revolution|communist revolution of 1917]].

In 1736–1737 the city suffered from catastrophic fires. To rebuild the damaged boroughs, a committee under [[Burkhard Christoph von Münnich]] commissioned a new plan in 1737. The city was divided into five boroughs, and the city centre was moved to the Admiralty borough, on the east bank between the Neva and [[Fontanka]].

[[File:Дворцовая_площадь_Санкт-Петербурга._Вид_из_Эрмитажа..JPG|thumb|[[Palace Square]] backed by the [[General Staff Building (Saint Petersburg)|General staff arch and building]], as the main square of the Russian Empire it was the setting of many events of historic significance]]

It developed along three radial streets, which meet at the [[Admiralty, Saint Petersburg|Admiralty building]] and are now one street known as [[Nevsky Prospect]] (which is considered the main street of the city), [[Gorokhovaya Street]] and [[Voznesensky Avenue]]. [[Baroque architecture]] became dominant in the city during the first sixty years, culminating in the Elizabethan Baroque, represented most notably by Italian [[Francesco Bartolomeo Rastrelli|Bartolomeo Rastrelli]] with such buildings as the [[Winter Palace]]. In the 1760s, Baroque architecture was succeeded by [[neoclassical architecture]].

Established in 1762, the Commission of Stone Buildings of Moscow and Saint Petersburg ruled no structure in the city can be higher than the Winter Palace and prohibited spacing between buildings. During the reign of [[Catherine the Great]] in the 1760s–1780s, the banks of the Neva were lined with [[granite]] embankments.

However, it was not until 1850 that the first permanent bridge across the Neva, [[Annunciation Bridge]], was allowed to open. Before that, only [[pontoon bridge]]s were allowed. [[Obvodny Canal]] (dug in 1769–1833) became the southern limit of the city.

The most prominent neoclassical and [[Empire style|Empire-style]] architects in Saint Petersburg included:
* [[Jean-Baptiste Vallin de la Mothe]] ([[Imperial Academy of Arts]], [[Hermitage Museum|Small Hermitage]], [[Great Gostiny Dvor|Gostiny Dvor]], [[New Holland Island|New Holland Arch]], [[Church of St. Catherine (Saint Petersburg)|Catholic Church of St. Catherine]])
* [[Antonio Rinaldi (architect)|Antonio Rinaldi]] ([[Marble Palace]])
* [[Yury Felten]] ([[Hermitage Museum|Old Hermitage]], [[Chesme Church]])
* [[Giacomo Quarenghi]] (Academy of Sciences, [[Hermitage Theatre]], [[Moika Palace|Yusupov Palace]])
* [[Andrey Voronikhin]] ([[Saint Petersburg Mining University|Mining Institute]], [[Kazan Cathedral, Saint Petersburg|Kazan Cathedral]])
* [[Andreyan Zakharov]] ([[Admiralty, Saint Petersburg|Admiralty building]])
* [[Jean-François Thomas de Thomon]] ([[Old Saint Petersburg Stock Exchange and Rostral Columns|Spit of Vasilievsky Island]])
* [[Carlo Rossi (architect)|Carlo Rossi]] ([[Yelagin Palace]], [[Russian Museum|Mikhailovsky Palace]], [[Alexandrinsky Theatre|Alexandrine Theatre]], [[Senate Square (Saint Petersburg)|Senate and Synod Buildings]], [[General Staff Building (Saint Petersburg)|General staff Building]], design of many streets and squares)
* [[Vasily Stasov]] ([[Moscow Triumphal Gate]], [[Trinity Cathedral, Saint Petersburg|Trinity Cathedral]])
* [[Auguste de Montferrand]] ([[Saint Isaac's Cathedral]], [[Alexander Column]])

[[File:Kolman decembrists.jpg|thumb|[[Decembrist revolt]] at the [[Senate Square (Saint Petersburg)|Senate Square]], 26 December 1825.]]

In 1810, [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I]] established the first engineering [[Higher education]], the [[Military Engineering-Technical University|Saint Petersburg Main military engineering School]] in Saint Petersburg. Many monuments commemorate the Russian victory over [[First French Empire|Napoleonic France]] in the [[French invasion of Russia|Patriotic War of 1812]], including the [[Alexander Column]] by Montferrand, erected in 1834, and the [[Narva Triumphal Arch]].

In 1825, the suppressed [[Decembrist revolt]] against [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicholas&nbsp;I]] took place on the [[Senate Square (Saint Petersburg)|Senate Square]] in the city, a day after Nicholas assumed the throne.

By the 1840s, neoclassical architecture had given way to various romanticist styles, which dominated until the 1890s, represented by such architects as [[Andrei Stackenschneider]] ([[Mariinsky Palace]], [[Beloselsky-Belozersky Palace]], [[Nicholas Palace]], [[Andrei Stackenschneider|New Michael Palace]]) and [[Konstantin Thon]] ([[Moskovsky railway station (Saint Petersburg)|Moskovsky railway station]]).

With the [[Emancipation reform of 1861|emancipation of the serfs]] undertaken by [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander&nbsp;II]] in 1861 and an [[Industrial Revolution]], the influx of former peasants into the capital increased greatly. Poor boroughs spontaneously emerged on the outskirts of the city. Saint Petersburg surpassed Moscow in population and industrial growth; it developed as one of the largest industrial cities in Europe, with a major naval base (in [[Kronstadt]]), river and sea port.

The names of Saints [[Saint Peter|Peter]] and [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]], bestowed upon [[Peter and Paul Fortress|original city's citadel]] and its [[Saints Peter and Paul Cathedral, Saint Petersburg|cathedral]] (from 1725—a [[Burial vault (tomb)|burial vault]] of Russian emperors) coincidentally were the names of the first two assassinated Russian Emperors, [[Peter III of Russia|Peter&nbsp;III]] (1762, supposedly killed in a conspiracy led by his wife, [[Catherine the Great]]) and [[Paul I of Russia|Paul&nbsp;I]] (1801, [[Nikolay Alexandrovich Zubov]] and other conspirators who brought to power [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander&nbsp;I]], the son of their victim). The third emperor's assassination took place in Saint Petersburg in 1881 when [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander&nbsp;II]] fell victim to [[Narodnaya Volya|terrorists]] (see the [[Church of the Savior on Blood]]).

The [[1905 Russian Revolution|Revolution of 1905]] began in Saint Petersburg and spread rapidly into the provinces.

On 1 September 1914, after the outbreak of [[World War I]], the Imperial government renamed the city ''Petrograd'',<ref name="vokrugsveta.ru" /> meaning "Peter's City", to remove the German words ''[[wikt:Sankt#German|Sankt]]'' and ''[[wikt:Burg#German|Burg]]''.

===Revolution and Soviet era (1917–1941)===
In March 1917, during the [[February Revolution]] Nicholas II abdicated for himself and on behalf of his son, ending the Russian monarchy and over three hundred years of [[Romanov dynasty|Romanov]] [[dynastic rule]].

In September and October 1917, German troops [[Operation Albion|invaded]] the [[West Estonian archipelago]] and threatened Petrograd with bombardment and invasion. On 12 March 1918, the Soviets transferred the government to Moscow, to keep it away from the state border. During the ensuing [[Russian Civil War|Civil War]], in 1919 general [[Nikolai Yudenich|Yudenich]] advancing from Estonia repeated the attempt to capture the city, but [[Leon Trotsky]] mobilized the army and forced him to retreat.

On 26 January 1924, five days after Lenin's death, Petrograd was renamed ''Leningrad''. Later some streets and other [[wikt:toponym|toponyms]] were renamed accordingly. The city has over 230 places associated with the life and activities of Lenin. Some of them were turned into museums,<ref name="Kann">{{cite book |author=Kann, Pavel Yakovlevich |title=Leningrad: A Short Guide|publisher=Foreign Languages Publishing House |location=Moscow |year=1963 |pages=132–133 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7TIaAAAAIAAJ&q=Lenin%20places%20in%20Leningrad |access-date=9 February 2011}}</ref> including the [[Russian cruiser Aurora|cruiser ''Aurora'']]—a symbol of the October Revolution and the oldest ship in the [[Russian Navy]].

In the 1920s and 1930s, the poor outskirts were reconstructed into regularly planned boroughs. [[Constructivist architecture]] flourished around that time. Housing became a government-provided [[social utility|amenity]]; many "bourgeois" apartments were so large that numerous families were assigned to what were called "communal" apartments (''[[kommunal apartment|kommunalkas]]''). By the 1930s, 68% of the population lived in such housing. In 1935 a new general plan was outlined, whereby the city should expand to the south. Constructivism was rejected in favour of a more pompous [[Stalinist architecture]]. Moving the city centre further from the border with Finland, [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] adopted a plan to build a new city hall with a huge adjacent square at the southern end of [[Moskovsky Prospekt]], designated as the new main street of Leningrad. After the [[Winter War|Winter (Soviet-Finnish) war]] in 1939–1940, the Soviet–Finnish border moved northwards. Nevsky Prospekt with Palace Square maintained the functions and the role of a city centre.

In December 1931, Leningrad was administratively separated from [[Leningrad Oblast]]. At that time it included the Leningrad Suburban District, some parts of which were transferred back to Leningrad Oblast in 1936 and turned into [[Vsevolozhsky District]], [[Krasnoselsky District, Saint Petersburg|Krasnoselsky District]], Pargolovsky District and Slutsky District (renamed Pavlovsky District in 1944).<ref name="autogenerated2">{{cite web|url=http://lenobltrans.narod.ru/adm1.html |title=Ленинградская область в целом: Административно-территориальное деление Ленинградской области |publisher=Lenobltrans.narod.ru |access-date=22 October 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090608000817/http://lenobltrans.narod.ru/adm1.html |archive-date=8 June 2009 }}

===World War II (1941–1945)===
{{Main|Siege of Leningrad}}

The [[Siege of Leningrad]] proved one of the longest, most destructive, and [[Most lethal battles in world history#Sieges and urban combat|most lethal sieges]] of a major city in [[modern history]]. It isolated the city from food supplies except those provided through the [[Road of Life]] across [[Lake Ladoga]], which could not make it through until the lake literally froze. More than one million civilians were killed, mainly from starvation. Many others escaped or were evacuated, so the city became largely depopulated.

On 1 May 1945 [[Joseph Stalin]], in his Supreme Commander Order No. 20, named Leningrad, alongside [[Stalingrad]], [[Sevastopol]], and [[Odessa]], [[Hero City|hero cities]] of the war. A law acknowledging the honorary title of "Hero City" passed on 8 May 1965 (the 20th anniversary of the victory in the Great Patriotic War), during the [[Leonid Brezhnev|Brezhnev era]]. The [[Presidium of the Supreme Soviet]] of the USSR awarded Leningrad as a Hero City the [[Order of Lenin]] and the [[Gold Star medal]] "for the heroic resistance of the city and tenacity of the survivors of the Siege". The [[Hero-City Obelisk]] bearing the [[Gold Star medal|Gold Star sign]] was installed in April 1985.

=== Post-war Soviet era (1945–1991) ===
[[File:Hammond Slides Leningrad 04.jpg|thumb|View of Lermontovski Prospekt, [[Egyptian Bridge]] and the [[Fontanka|Fontanka River]], 1972]]
In October 1946 some territories along the northern coast of the [[Gulf of Finland]], which had passed to the USSR from Finland in 1940 under the [[Moscow Peace Treaty|peace treaty]] following the [[Winter War]], were transferred from Leningrad Oblast to Leningrad and divided into [[Sestroretsk|Sestroretsky District]] and [[Kurortny District]]. These included the town of [[Zelenogorsk, Saint Petersburg|Terijoki]] (renamed [[Zelenogorsk]] in 1948).<ref name="autogenerated2"/> Leningrad and many of its suburbs were rebuilt over the post-war decades, partially according to pre-war plans. The 1948 general plan for Leningrad featured radial [[urban planning|urban development]] in the north as well as in the south. In 1953 Pavlovsky District in Leningrad Oblast was abolished, and parts of its territory, including Pavlovsk, merged with Leningrad. In 1954 the settlements [[Levashovo, Saint Petersburg|Levashovo]], [[Pargolovo]] and [[Pesochny, Russia|Pesochny]] merged with Leningrad.<ref name="autogenerated2"/>
[[File:Leningrad 1991 (4387699303).jpg|thumb|left|[[Griboedov Canal]] and the [[Church of the Saviour on Blood]], 1991]]
Leningrad gave its name to the [[Leningrad Affair]] (1949–1952), a notable event in the postwar political struggle in the [[USSR]]. It was a product of rivalry between Stalin's potential successors where one side was represented by the leaders of the city [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]] organization—the second most significant one in the country after Moscow. The entire elite leadership of Leningrad was destroyed, including the former mayor [[Alexey Kuznetsov|Kuznetsov]], the acting mayor Pyotr Sergeevich Popkov, and all their deputies; overall 23 leaders were sentenced to the death penalty, 181 to prison or exile (exonerated in 1954). About 2,000 ranking officials across the USSR were expelled from the party and the Komsomol and removed from leadership positions. They were accused of Russian [[nationalism]].<ref name="Zubkova">{{cite book |author=Zubkova, Elena Yurievna |title=Russia after the war: hopes, illusions, and disappointments, 1945–1957 |chapter=Chronology of Major Events |editor-first=Hugh |editor-last=Ragsdale |publisher=M.E.

The [[Saint Petersburg Metro|Leningrad Metro]] underground [[rapid transit|rapid transit system]], designed before the war, opened in 1955 with its first eight stations decorated with [[marble]] and [[bronze]]. However, after Stalin's death in 1953, the perceived ornamental excesses of the Stalinist architecture were abandoned. From the 1960s to the 1980s many new residential boroughs were built on the outskirts; while the [[functionalism (architecture)|functionalist]] apartment blocks were nearly identical to each other, many families moved there from ''kommunalkas'' in the city centre to live in separate apartments.

===Contemporary era (1991–present)===
[[File:Spb Views from Isaac Cathedral May2012 09.jpg|thumb|upright 1.1|left|View of the city from the [[Saint Isaac's Cathedral]]]]
On 12 June 1991, simultaneously with the [[1991 Russian presidential election|first Russian presidential elections]], the city authorities arranged for the mayoral elections and a referendum upon the name of the city, when the name reverted to Saint Petersburg. The turnout was 65%; 66.13% of the total count of votes went to [[Anatoly Sobchak]], who became the first directly elected [[list of heads of Saint Petersburg government|mayor of the city]].

Meanwhile, economic conditions started to deteriorate as the country tried to adapt to major changes. For the first time since the 1940s, food [[rationing]] was introduced, and the city received humanitarian [[World Food Programme|food aid]] from abroad.<ref name="Orttung"/> This dramatic time was depicted in photographic series of Russian photographer [[Alexey Titarenko]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Ollman |first=Leah |date=3 August 2001 |title=Russian Photos Trace Images of Mortality and Memory |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2001/aug/03/entertainment/ca-30027 |work=Los Angeles Times |access-date=25 August 2018  }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Dunne |first=Aiden |author-link=Aidan Dunne |date=17 May 2007 |title=Camera in a City of Shadows |url=https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/camera-in-a-city-of-shadows-1.1206242 |work=[[The Irish Times]] |location=Dublin |access-date=25 August 2018 }}</ref> Economic conditions began to improve only at the beginning of the 21st century.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://petrostat.gks.ru/wps/wcm/connect/rosstat_ts/petrostat/resources/58cc7e804f0a97d5bbddbb22524f7e0f/SPB15.pdf | title=CАНКТ ПЕТЕРБУРГ ВАЛОВОЙ РЕГИОНАЛЬНЫЙ ПРОДУКТ в 1998–2003 гг | language=ru | publisher=gks.ru | access-date=13 November 2018 }}</ref> In 1995 a northern section of the [[Line 1 of Saint Petersburg Metro|Kirovsko-Vyborgskaya Line]] of the [[Saint Petersburg Metro]] was cut off by underground flooding, creating a major obstacle to the city development for almost ten years.

In 1996, [[Vladimir Anatolyevich Yakovlev|Vladimir Yakovlev]] defeated [[Anatoly Sobchak]] in the elections for the head of the [[Saint Petersburg City Administration|city administration]]. The title of the city head was changed from "mayor" to "governor". In 2000 Yakovlev won re-election. His second term expired in 2004; the long-awaited restoration of the broken subway connection was expected to finish by that time. But in 2003 Yakovlev suddenly resigned, leaving the governor's office to [[Valentina Matviyenko]].

[[File:4A7A3069 Moika, Saint Petersburg (35468573803).jpg|thumb|upright 1.1|[[Moyka|Moyka River]], flowing through [[Central Saint Petersburg]]]]
The law on election of the City Governor was changed, breaking the tradition of democratic election by a universal suffrage. In 2006 the [[Legislative Assembly of Saint Petersburg|city legislature]] re-approved Matviyenko as governor. Residential building had intensified again; [[real estate pricing|real-estate prices]] inflated greatly, which caused many new problems for the preservation of the historical part of the city.

Although the central part of the city has a [[UNESCO]] designation (there are about 8,000 architectural monuments in Petersburg), the preservation of its historical and architectural environment became controversial.<ref>{{cite web|first=Sergey|last=Zagraevsky|author-link=Sergey Zagraevsky|title=Will Saint Petersburg share the same fate as Moscow? |date=2008 |url=http://zagraevsky.com/piter_engl.htm|publisher=Zagraevsky.com |access-date=16 November 2012}}</ref> After 2005, the demolition of older buildings in the historical centre was permitted.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://rusarch.ru/attn_spb3.htm |title=Photos of the violations of the historical environment of Saint Petersburg |publisher=Rusarch.ru |access-date=22 October 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110826114026/http://rusarch.ru/attn_spb3.htm |archive-date=26 August 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In 2006 [[Gazprom]] announced an ambitious project to erect a {{cvt|403|m}} skyscraper (the [[Okhta Center]]) opposite to [[Smolny]], which{{according to whom|date=April 2013}} could result in the loss of the unique line of Petersburg landscape.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} Urgent protests by citizens and prominent public figures of Russia against this project were not considered by Governor [[Valentina Matviyenko]] and the city authorities until December 2010, when after the statement of President [[Dmitry Medvedev]], the city decided to find a more appropriate location for this project. In the same year, the new location for the project was relocated to [[Lakhta, Saint Petersburg|Lakhta]], a historical area northwest of the city centre, and the new project would be named [[Lakhta Center]].

==Geography==
{{Main|Geography of Saint Petersburg}}
{{wide image|Panorama of Saint Petersburg from Palace Bridge.jpg|1200px|align-cap=center|The [[Neva|Neva River]] flows through much of the centre of the city.

[[File:Saint Petersburg, Russia by Planet Labs.jpg|thumb|upright 1.2|Satellite image of Saint Petersburg and its suburbs]]
The area of Saint Petersburg city proper is {{convert|605.8|km2|abbr=in}}. The area of the federal subject is {{cvt|1439|km2}}, which contains Saint Petersburg proper (consisting of eighty-one municipal ''[[okrug]]s''), nine municipal towns – ([[Kolpino]], [[Krasnoye Selo]], [[Kronstadt]], [[Lomonosov, Russia|Lomonosov]], [[Pavlovsk, Saint Petersburg|Pavlovsk]], [[Petergof]], [[Pushkin (town)|Pushkin]], [[Sestroretsk]], [[Zelenogorsk, Saint Petersburg|Zelenogorsk]]) – and twenty-one municipal settlements.

Petersburg is on the middle [[taiga]] lowlands along the shores of the [[Neva Bay]] of the [[Gulf of Finland]], and islands of the river delta. The largest are [[Vasilyevsky Island]] (besides the [[artificial island]] between Obvodny canal and [[Fontanka]], and [[Kotlin Island|Kotlin]] in the [[Neva Bay]]), [[Petrogradsky Island|Petrogradsky]], [[Dekabristov Island|Dekabristov]] and [[Krestovsky Island|Krestovsky]]. The latter together with [[Yelagin Island|Yelagin]] and [[Kamenny Island]] are covered mostly by parks. The [[Karelian Isthmus]], North of the city, is a popular [[Tourist destination|resort area]]. In the south Saint Petersburg crosses the [[Baltic Klint|Baltic-Ladoga Klint]] and meets the [[Izhora Plateau]].

The elevation of Saint Petersburg ranges from the sea level to its highest point of {{cvt|175.9|m}} at the Orekhovaya Hill in the [[Duderhof Heights]] in the south. Part of the city's territory west of [[Liteyny Prospekt]] is no higher than {{cvt|4|m}} [[above mean sea level|above sea level]], and has suffered from numerous floods. [[Floods in Saint Petersburg]] are triggered by a long wave in the [[Baltic Sea]], caused by meteorological conditions, winds and shallowness of the [[Neva Bay]]. The five most disastrous floods occurred in 1824 ({{cvt|4.21|m|ftin|disp=or}} above sea level, during which over 300 buildings were destroyed{{efn|The level of flooding is measured near [[Saint Petersburg Mining Institute]], which is normally {{cvt|11|cm}} above sea level}}), 1924 ({{cvt|3.8|m|ftin|disp=comma}}), 1777 ({{cvt|3.21|m|ftin|disp=comma}}), 1955 ({{cvt|2.93|m|ftin|disp=comma}}), and 1975 ({{cvt|2.81|m|ftin|disp=comma}}). To prevent floods, the [[Saint Petersburg Dam]] has been constructed.<ref>Nezhikhovsky, R.A. ''Река Нева и Невская губа'' [''The Neva River and Neva Bay''], Leningrad: Gidrometeoizdat, 1981.</ref>

Since the 18th century the city's terrain has been raised artificially, at some places by more than {{cvt|4|m}}, making mergers of several islands, and changing the hydrology of the city. Besides the Neva and its tributaries, other important rivers of the federal subject of Saint Petersburg are [[Sestra River (Leningrad Oblast)|Sestra]], [[Okhta River (Neva basin)|Okhta]] and [[Izhora River|Izhora]]. The largest lake is Sestroretsky Razliv in the north, followed by [[Lakhtinsky Razliv]], Suzdal Lakes and other smaller lakes.

Due to its northerly location at ca. 60° N [[latitude]] the [[day length]] in Petersburg varies across seasons, ranging from 5 hours 53 minutes to 18 hours 50 minutes. A period from mid-May to mid-July when twilight may last all night is called ''the [[Midnight sun|white nights]]''.

Saint Petersburg is about {{convert|165|km|abbr=in}} from the border with Finland, connected to it via the [[M10 highway (Russia)|M10 highway]].

===Climate===
{{Main|Climate of Saint Petersburg}}

Under the [[Köppen climate classification]], Saint Petersburg is classified as ''Dfb'', a [[humid continental climate]]. The distinct moderating influence of [[Baltic Sea]] cyclones results in warm, humid and short summers and long, moderately cold wet winters. The climate of Saint Petersburg is close to that of [[Helsinki]], although colder in winter and warmer in summer because of its more eastern location.

The average maximum temperature in July is {{convert|23|C}}, and the average minimum temperature in February is {{convert|-8.5|C}}; an extreme temperature of {{convert|37.1|C}} occurred during the [[2010 Northern Hemisphere summer heat wave]]. A winter minimum of {{convert|-35.9|C}} was recorded in 1883. The average annual temperature is {{convert|5.8|C}}. The Neva River within the city limits usually freezes up in November–December and break-up occurs in April. From December to March there are 118 days average with snow cover, which reaches an average snow depth of {{cvt|19|cm}} by February.<ref name= pogoda/> The frost-free period in the city lasts on average for about 135 days. Despite St. Petersburg's northern location, its winters are warmer than [[Moscow#Climate|Moscow's]] due to the [[Gulf of Finland]] and some [[Gulf Stream]] influence from Scandinavian winds that can bring temperature slightly above freezing. The city also has a slightly warmer climate than its suburbs. Weather conditions are quite variable all year round.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tutiempo.net/en/Climate/St_Peterburg/260630.htm |title=Climate St. Peterburg – Historical weather records |publisher=Tutiempo.net |access-date=16 November 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://rp5.ru/archive.php?wmo_id=26063 |title=Архив погоды в Санкт-Петербурге, Санкт-Петербург |publisher=Rp5.ru |access-date=16 November 2012}}</ref>

Average annual [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] varies across the city, averaging {{cvt|660|mm}} per year and reaching maximum in late summer. Soil moisture is almost always high because of lower [[evapotranspiration]] due to the cool climate. [[Relative humidity|Air humidity]] is 78% on average, and there are, on average, 165 [[overcast]] days per year.

===Toponymy===
The first and fairly rich chapter of the history of the local [[wikt:toponym|toponymy]] is the story of the city's name. The [[name day]] of [[Saint Peter|Peter I]] falls on 29 June,<!--https://www.ualberta.ca/~pogosjan/peter/paragraf1_2_3.html--> when the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] observes the memory of [[Saint]] [[Apostle (Christian)|Apostles]] [[Saint Peter|Peter]] and [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]]. The consecration of the small wooden church in their names (its construction began at the same time as the citadel) made them the heavenly patrons of the [[Peter and Paul Fortress]], while St.&nbsp;Peter at the same time became the [[eponym]] of the whole city. In June 1703 [[Peter the Great]] gave the site the name ''Sankt Pieter Burkh'' (an emulation of Dutch topographical suffix ''-burg'', which refers to fortified towns and places, as Peter was a [[Netherlands|Neerlandophile]]) which was subsequently [[Russification|russified]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/06/13/world/leningrad-petersburg-and-the-great-name-debate.html|title=Leningrad, Petersburg and the Great Name Debate|date=13 June 1991|work=The New York Times}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HeJzBgAAQBAJ&q=saint+petersburg+named+after+dutch&pg=PT395|title=Lonely Planet St Petersburg|first1=Tom|last1=Masters|first2=Simon|last2=Richmond|date=2015|publisher=[[Lonely Planet]]|via=Google Books|isbn=978-1743605035}}</ref>

[[File:Peter der-Grosse 1838.jpg|upright|thumb|right|While not originally named for Tsar [[Peter the Great]], during World War I the city was changed from the Germanic "Peterburg" to "Petrograd" in his honour]]
A 14- to 15-letter-long name, composed of the three [[word root|roots]] proved too cumbersome, and many shortened versions were used. The first General Governor of the city [[Aleksandr Danilovich Menshikov|Menshikov]] is maybe also the author of the first nickname of Petersburg which he called ''Петри'' (''Petri''). It took some years until the known Russian spelling of this name finally settled. In 1740s [[Mikhail Lomonosov]] uses a derivative of {{lang-el|link=no|Πετρόπολις}} (''Petropolis''; ''Петрополис'', ''Petropolis'') in a Russified form ''Petropol{{'}}'' (''Петрополь''). A combo ''Piterpol'' (''Питерпол'') also appears at this time.<ref name="nester">Nesterov, V. "''Знаешь ли ты свой город''" ("Do you know your city?"). Leningrad, 1958, p. 58.</ref> In any case, eventually the usage of prefix "''Sankt-''" ceased except for the formal official documents, where a three-letter abbreviation "СПб" (''SPb'') was very widely used as well.

In the 1830s [[Alexander Pushkin]] translated the "foreign" city name of "Saint Petersburg" to the more Russian ''Petrograd'' in one of his poems. However, it was only on {{OldStyleDate|31 August|1914|18 August}}, after [[World War I|the war]] with Germany had begun, that Tsar [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]] renamed the capital to Petrograd.

After the [[October Revolution]] the name ''Red Petrograd'' (''Красный Петроград'', ''Krasny Petrograd'') was often used in newspapers and other prints until the city was renamed ''Leningrad'' in January 1924.

A referendum on reversing the renaming of ''Leningrad'' was held on 12 June 1991, with 54.86% of voters (with a turnout of 65%) supporting "''Saint Petersburg''". Renaming the city ''Petrograd'' was not an option. This change officially took effect on 6 September 1991.<ref name="Orttung">{{cite book |last=Orttung |first=Robert W. |title=From Leningrad to Saint Petersburg |chapter=Chronology of Major Events |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |location=London and New York |year=1995 |isbn=978-0-312-12080-1 |pages=273–277 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UjbaxYyS2MYC&q=From+Leningrad+to+Saint+Petersburg}}</ref> Meanwhile, the oblast whose administrative center is also in Saint Petersburg is still named [[Leningrad Oblast|Leningrad]].

Having passed the role of capital to Petersburg, Moscow never relinquished the title of "capital", being called ''pervoprestolnaya'' ("first-throned") for 200 years. An equivalent name for Petersburg, the "Northern Capital", has re-entered usage today since several federal institutions were recently moved from Moscow to Saint Petersburg. Solemn descriptive names like "the city of three revolutions" and "the cradle of the [[October revolution]]" used in Soviet-era are reminders of the pivotal events in national history that occurred here. For their part, poetic names of the city, like the "[[Venice of the North]]" and the "Northern [[Palmyra]]" emphasize town-planning and architectural features contrasting these parallels to the northern location of this [[megalopolis (city type)|megalopolis]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/st-petersburg-the-venice-of-the-north-gets-its-own-fleet-of-gondolas-733899.html |title=St Petersburg, the 'Venice of the North', gets its own fleet of gondolas |work=[[The Independent]] |location=London |date=29 June 2004 |access-date=7 December 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111020191228/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/st-petersburg-the-venice-of-the-north-gets-its-own-fleet-of-gondolas-733899.html |archive-date=20 October 2011 }}</ref> ''Petropolis'' is a translation of a city name to Greek, and is also a kind of descriptive name: [[:el:Πέτρωμα|Πέτρ-]] is a Greek root for "stone", so the "city from stone" emphasizes the material that had been forcibly made obligatory for construction from the first years of the city.<ref name="nester"/> (Its official Greek name is ''Αγία Πετρούπολη''.)

During the 20th century, the city experienced dramatic population changes. From 2.4&nbsp;million residents in 1916, its population dropped to less than 740,000 by 1920 during the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution of 1917]] and [[Russian Civil War]].

People in urban Saint Petersburg lived mostly in apartments. Between 1918 and the 1990s, the Soviets [[Nationalization|nationalised]] housing and forced residents to share communal apartments (''[[communal apartment|kommunalkas]]''). With 68% living in shared flats in the 1930s, Leningrad was the city in the USSR with the largest number of ''kommunalkas''. Resettling residents of ''kommunalkas'' is now on the way out, albeit shared apartments are still not uncommon. As new boroughs were built on the outskirts in the 1950s–1980s, over half a million low-income families eventually received free apartments, and about an additional hundred thousand condos were purchased. While economic and social activity is concentrated in the [[Central Saint Petersburg|historic city centre]], the richest part of Saint Petersburg, most people live in [[Metropolitan area|commuter areas]].{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}

According to the federal law passed in 2004, heads of federal subjects, including the governor of Saint Petersburg, were nominated by the [[President of Russia]] and approved by local legislatures. Should the legislature disapprove the nominee, the President could dissolve it. The former governor, [[Valentina Matviyenko]], was approved according to the new system in December 2006.

Ten per cent of the world's power [[turbine]]s are made there at the [[Leningradsky Metallichesky Zavod|LMZ]], which built over two thousand turbines for [[power station|power plants]] across the world. Major local industries are [[Admiralty Shipyard]], [[Baltic Shipyard]], [[LOMO]], [[Kirov Plant]], [[Elektrosila]], [[Izhorskiye Zavody]]; also registered in Saint Petersburg are [[Sovcomflot|Sovkomflot]], [[Petersburg Fuel Company]] and [[Sibur|SIBUR]] among other major Russian and international companies.

Saint Petersburg has three large cargo [[ports of the Baltic Sea|seaports]]: Bolshoi Port Saint Petersburg, [[Kronstadt]], and [[Lomonosov, Russia|Lomonosov]]. International [[cruise ship|cruise liners]] have been served at the passenger port at Morskoy Vokzal on the south-west of [[Vasilyevsky Island]].

A complex system of riverports on both banks of the [[Neva River]] are interconnected with the system of seaports, thus making Saint Petersburg the main link between the [[Baltic Sea]] and the rest of Russia through the [[Volga–Baltic Waterway|Volga-Baltic Waterway]].

The [[Saint Petersburg Mint]] (Monetny Dvor), founded in 1724, is one of the largest [[mint (coin)|mints]] in the world, it mints [[Russian ruble|Russian coins]], medals and badges. Saint Petersburg is also home to the oldest and largest Russian foundry, Monumentskulptura, which made thousands of sculptures and statues that now grace public parks of Saint Petersburg, as well as many other cities. Monuments and [[bronze sculpture|bronze statues]] of the Tsars, as well as other important historic figures and dignitaries, and other world-famous monuments, such as the sculptures by [[Peter Clodt von Jürgensburg]], [[Paolo Troubetzkoy]], [[Mark Antokolsky]], and others, were made there.

In 2007, [[Toyota]] opened a [[Toyota Camry|Camry]] plant after investing 5&nbsp;billion roubles (approx. 200 mln dollars) in Shushary, one of the southern suburbs of Saint Petersburg. [[Opel]], [[Hyundai Motor Company|Hyundai]] and Nissan have also signed deals with the [[Politics of Russia|Russian government]] to build their automotive plants in Saint Petersburg. Automotive and auto-parts industry is on the rise there during the last decade.

Saint Petersburg has a large brewery and distillery industry. Known as Russia's "beer capital" due to the supply and quality of local water, its five large breweries account for over 30% of the country's domestic beer production. They include Europe's second largest brewery [[Baltika Breweries|Baltika]], Vena (both operated by BBH), [[Heineken International|Heineken Brewery]], [[Stenka Razin|Stepan Razin]] (both by [[Heineken Pilsener|Heineken]]) and [[Tinkoff brewery]] (SUN-[[InBev]]).

The city's many local [[distillery|distilleries]] produce a broad range of [[vodka]] brands. The oldest ones is [[:ru:Ливиз|LIVIZ]] (founded in 1897). Among the youngest is [[Russian Standard Vodka]] introduced in Moscow in 1998, which opened in 2006 a new $60&nbsp;million distillery in Petersburg (an area of {{convert|30000|m2|abbr=on}}, production rate of 22,500 bottles per hour).

==Cityscape==
{{Main|Landmarks of Saint Petersburg|Kronstadt}}
[[File:Gazprom tower (Lakhta Center) St Petersburg. Russia.jpg|thumb|left|[[Lakhta Center]], the tallest building in Europe]]
Saint Petersburg has three skyscrapers: Leader Tower (140 m), Alexander Nevsky (124 m) and Atlantic City (105 m) all far from the historical centre. Regulations forbid construction of tall buildings in the city centre. The {{convert|310|m|sp=us|adj=on}} tall [[Saint Petersburg TV Tower]] is the tallest completed structure in the city. However, there was a controversial project endorsed by the city authorities, and known as the [[Okhta Center]], to build a {{convert|396|m|sp=us}} [[list of tallest buildings and structures in the world|supertall]] skyscraper. In 2008, the [[World Monuments Fund]] included the Saint Petersburg historic skyline on the watch list of the 100 most endangered sites due to the expected construction, which threatens to alter it drastically.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wmf.org/watch2008/watch.php?id=S8352 |title=St. Petersburg Historic Skyline, Russian Federation |publisher=Wmf.org |access-date=22 October 2009}}</ref> The Okhta Center project was cancelled at the end of 2010 and the [[Lakhta Center]] project began in the city's outskirts. The complex includes {{convert|463|m|ft|abbr=off|adj=mid|-tall}} office skyscraper and several low rise mixed use buildings. The Lakhta Center project has caused much less controversy and, unlike the previous unbuilt project, is not seen by [[UNESCO]] as a potential threat to the city's cultural heritage because it is far from the historical centre. The skyscraper was completed in 2019, and at 462.5 metres, it is currently the [[List of tallest buildings in Europe|tallest in Russia and Europe]].
[[File:Kazan Cathedral - panoramio (1).jpg|thumb|[[Kazan Cathedral, Saint Petersburg|Kazan Cathedral]], an example of [[Neoclassical architecture]]]]
[[File:Saint Isaac's Square SPB (01).jpg|thumb|[[Saint Isaac's Square]]|left]]
Unlike in Moscow, the historic architecture of Saint Petersburg's city centre, mostly [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] and [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]]  buildings of the 18th and 19th centuries, has been largely preserved; although a number of buildings were demolished after the Bolsheviks' seizure of power, during the [[Siege of Leningrad]] and in recent years. {{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} The oldest of the remaining building is a wooden house built for [[Peter the Great|Peter I]] in 1703 on the shore of the [[Neva]] near Trinity Square. Since 1991 the [[Historic Centre of Saint Petersburg and Related Groups of Monuments]] in Saint Petersburg and Leningrad Oblast have been listed by [[UNESCO]] as a [[World Heritage Site]].

The ensemble of [[Peter and Paul Fortress]] with the [[Peter and Paul Cathedral]] takes a dominant position on [[Zayachy Island]] along the right bank of the [[Neva River]]. Each noon a cannon fires a blank shot from the fortress. The [[Saint Petersburg Mosque]], the largest mosque in Europe when opened in 1913, is on the right bank nearby. The [[Spit of Vasilievsky Island]], which splits the river into two largest armlets, the [[Bolshaya Neva]] and [[Malaya Neva]], is connected to the northern bank ([[Petrogradsky Island]]) via the [[Exchange Bridge]] and occupied by the [[Old Saint Petersburg Stock Exchange and Rostral Columns]]. The southern coast of [[Vasilyevsky Island]] along the Bolshaya Neva features some of the city's oldest buildings, dating from the 18th century, including the [[Kunstkamera]], [[Twelve Collegia]], [[Menshikov Palace]] and [[Imperial Academy of Arts]]. It hosts one of two campuses of [[Saint Petersburg State University]]. [[File:RUS-2016-Aerial-SPB-Peter and Paul Fortress 02.jpg|thumb|Aerial view of [[Peter and Paul Fortress]]]] On the southern, left bank of the Neva, connected to the spit of Vasilyevsky Island via the [[Palace Bridge]], lie the [[Admiralty building, Saint Petersburg|Admiralty building]], the vast [[Hermitage Museum]] complex stretching along the [[Palace Embankment]], which includes the Baroque [[Winter Palace]], former official residence of Russian emperors, as well as the neoclassical [[Marble Palace]]. The Winter Palace faces [[Palace Square]], the city's main square with the [[Alexander Column]].

[[Nevsky Prospekt]], also on the left bank of the [[Neva]], is the city's main avenue. It starts at the Admiralty and runs eastwards next to Palace Square. Nevsky Prospekt crosses the [[Moyka River|Moika]] ([[Green Bridge (Saint Petersburg)|Green Bridge]]), [[Griboyedov Canal]] ([[Kazansky Bridge]]), [[Sadovaya Street|Garden Street]], the [[Fontanka]] ([[Anichkov Bridge]]), meets [[Liteyny Prospekt]] and proceeds to [[Vosstaniya Square|Uprising Square]] near the [[Moskovsky Rail Terminal (Saint Petersburg)|Moskovsky railway station]], where it meets [[Ligovsky Prospekt]] and turns to the [[Alexander Nevsky Lavra]]. [[Passage (department store)|The Passage]], [[Catholic Church of St. Catherine (Saint Petersburg)|Catholic Church of St. Catherine]], [[Singer House|Book House]] (former [[Singer Corporation|Singer Manufacturing Company]] Building in the [[Art Nouveau]] style), [[Grand Hotel Europe]], [[Lutheran Church of Saint Peter and Saint Paul]], [[Great Gostiny Dvor]], [[National Library of Russia|Russian National Library]], [[Alexandrinsky Theatre|Alexandrine Theatre]] behind [[Mikhail Mikeshin|Mikeshin]]'s statue of [[Catherine the Great]], [[Kazan Cathedral, St. Petersburg|Kazan Cathedral]], [[Stroganov Palace]], [[Anichkov Palace]] and [[Beloselsky-Belozersky Palace]] are all along that avenue.
[[File:Nevsky Avenue 01.jpg|thumb|[[Nevsky Prospekt]]|left]] 
[[File:Saint Petersburg 2019.jpg|thumb|[[Palace Square]] during Christmas|left]]
The [[Alexander Nevsky Lavra]], intended to house the relics of [[Alexander Nevsky|St. Alexander Nevsky]], is an important centre of [[Religious studies|Christian education]] in Russia. It also contains the [[Tikhvin Cemetery]] with graves of many notable Petersburgers.

On the territory between the Neva and Nevsky Prospekt the [[Church of the Savior on Blood]], Mikhailovsky Palace housing the [[Russian Museum]], [[Field of Mars (Saint Petersburg)|Field of Mars]], [[Saint Michael's Castle|St. Michael's Castle]], [[Summer Garden]], [[Tauride Palace]], [[Smolny Institute]] and [[Smolny Convent]] are located.[[File:The Church of the Saviour on Spilled Blood (20956466968).jpg|thumb|[[Church of the Savior on Blood]], seen from [[Griboyedov Canal]]|left]] [[File:Smolny Cathedral SPB 02.jpg|thumb|[[Smolny Convent]], an example of [[Baroque architecture]]]]Many notable landmarks are to the west and south of the Admiralty Building, including the [[Trinity Cathedral, Saint Petersburg|Trinity Cathedral]], [[Mariinsky Palace]], [[Hotel Astoria (Saint Petersburg)|Hotel Astoria]], famous [[Mariinsky Theatre]], [[New Holland Island]], [[Saint Isaac's Cathedral]], the largest in the city, and [[Senate Square (Saint Petersburg)|Senate Square]], with the [[Bronze Horseman]], 18th century equestrian monument to [[Peter the Great]], which is considered among the city's most recognisable symbols.
Other symbols of Saint Petersburg include the [[weather vane]] in the shape of a small ship on top of the Admiralty's golden spire and the golden angel on top of the Peter and Paul Cathedral. The Palace Bridge [[drawbridge|drawn]] at night is yet another symbol of the city.

From April to November, 22 bridges across the Neva and main canals are drawn to let ships pass in and out of the Baltic Sea according to a schedule.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mr7.ru/info/most/|title=График разводки мостов на Неве в Санкт-Петербурге|access-date=3 October 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100827013819/http://www.mr7.ru/info/most/|archive-date=27 August 2010}}</ref> It was not until 2004 that the first high bridge across the Neva, which does not need to be drawn, [[Big Obukhovsky Bridge]], was opened. The most remarkable bridges of our days are Korabelny and Petrovsky cable-stayed bridges, which form the most spectacular part of the city toll road, [[Western High-Speed Diameter]]. There are hundreds of smaller [[List of bridges in Saint Petersburg|bridges in Saint Petersburg]] spanning numerous canals and distributaries of the Neva, some of the most important of which are the [[Moyka River|Moika]], [[Fontanka]], [[Griboyedov Canal]], [[Obvodny Canal]], [[Karpovka River|Karpovka]] and [[Smolenka River|Smolenka]]. Due to the intricate web of canals, Saint Petersburg is often called ''[[Venice of the North]]''. The rivers and canals in the city centre are lined with granite embankments. The embankments and bridges are separated from rivers and canals by [[granite]] or [[cast iron]] [[parapet]]s.

[[File:RUS-2016-Aerial-SPB-Peterhof Palace.jpg|thumb|Aerial view of [[Peterhof Palace]]]]
Southern suburbs of the city feature former imperial residences, including [[Petergof]], with majestic fountain cascades and parks, [[Tsarskoye Selo|Tsarskoe Selo]], with the baroque [[Catherine Palace]] and the neoclassical [[Alexander Palace]], and [[Pavlovsk Palace|Pavlovsk]], which has a domed palace of [[Paul I of Russia|Emperor Paul]] and one of Europe's largest English-style parks. Some other residences nearby and making part of the world heritage site, including a castle and park in [[Gatchina]], actually belong to [[Leningrad Oblast]] rather than Saint Petersburg. Another notable suburb is [[Kronstadt]] with its 19th-century fortifications and naval monuments, occupying the [[Kotlin Island]] in the Gulf of Finland.

Since around the end of the 20th century a great deal of active building and restoration works have been carried out in a number of the city's older districts.
The authorities have recently been compelled to transfer the ownership of state-owned private residences in the city centre to private lessors.
Many older buildings have been reconstructed to allow their use as apartments and penthouses.

Some of these structures, such as the [[Saint Petersburg Commodity and Stock Exchange]] have been recognised as town-planning errors.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bn.ru/articles/2008/12/03/39306.html|trans-title=Virtual protection of Petersburg |script-title=ru:Виртуальная защита Петербурга|last=Hudyakov |first=Artyom|date=12 March 2008|publisher=bn.ru/|language=ru|access-date=5 August 2009}}</ref>

===Parks===
[[File:Temple of Friendship in Pavlovsk Park 01.jpg|thumb|The "Temple of Friendship" in [[Pavlovsk Park]]]]
Saint Petersburg is home to many parks and gardens. Some of the most well-known are in the southern suburbs, including [[Pavlovsk Palace|Pavlovsk]], one of Europe's largest [[English garden]]s. [[Sosnovka]] is the largest park within the city limits, occupying 240 ha. The [[Summer Garden]] is the oldest, dating back to the early 18th century and designed in the regular style. It is on the Neva's southern bank at the head of the Fontanka and is famous for its cast iron railing and marble sculptures.

Among other notable parks are the [[Maritime Victory Park]] on [[Krestovsky Island]] and the Moscow Victory Park in the south, both commemorating the victory over [[Nazi Germany]] in the [[Second World War]], as well as the [[Central Scherbakov Park of Culture and Leisure|Central Park of Culture and Leisure]] occupying [[Yelagin Island]] and the Tauride Garden around the [[Tauride Palace]]. The most common trees grown in the parks are the [[Quercus robur|English oak]], [[Acer platanoides|Norway maple]], [[Fraxinus pennsylvanica|green ash]], [[Betula pendula|silver birch]], [[Siberian Larch]], [[Picea pungens|blue spruce]], [[Salix fragilis|crack willow]], [[Tilia|limes]], and [[Populus|poplars]]. Important [[Xylotheque|dendrological collections]] dating back to the 19th century are hosted by the [[Saint Petersburg Botanical Garden]] and the Park of the Forestry Academy.

In order to commemorate 300 years anniversary of Saint Petersburg a new park was laid out. The park is in the northwestern part of the city. The construction was started in 1995. It is planned to connect the park with the pedestrian bridge to the territory of [[Lakhta Center]]'s recreation areas. In the park 300 trees of valuable sorts, 300 decorative apple-trees, 70 limes. 300 other trees and bushes were planted. These trees were presented to Saint Petersburg by non-commercial and educational organizations of the city, its sister-cities, city of Helsinki, heads of other regions of Russia, German Savings Bank and other people and organizations.<ref>{{in lang|ru}}[http://www.apmtri.ru/projects/blagoustrojstvo_v_sanktpeterburge/park_300letija_s_peterburga] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140709132017/http://www.apmtri.ru/projects/blagoustrojstvo_v_sanktpeterburge/park_300letija_s_peterburga|date=9 July 2014}}</ref>

The 18th and 19th century architectural ensemble of the city and its environs is preserved in virtually unchanged form. For various reasons (including large-scale destruction during [[World War II]] and construction of modern buildings during the postwar period in the largest historical centres of Europe), Saint Petersburg has become a unique reserve of European architectural styles of the past three centuries. Saint Petersburg's loss of capital city status helped it retain many of its pre-revolutionary buildings, as modern architectural 'prestige projects' tended to be built in Moscow; this largely prevented the rise of mid-to-late-20th century architecture and helped maintain the architectural appearance of the historic city centre.

Saint Petersburg is inscribed on the [[UNESCO]] World Heritage list as an area with 36 historical architectural complexes and around 4000 outstanding individual monuments of architecture, history and culture. New tourist programs and sightseeing tours have been developed for those wishing to see Saint Petersburg's cultural heritage.
[[File:Andrey Zeest - Amber Room 2 (autochrome).jpg|thumb|The [[Amber Room]] in the [[Catherine Palace]]]]

The city has 221 museums, 2000 libraries, more than 80 theatres, 100 concert organizations, 45 galleries and exhibition halls, 62 cinemas and around 80 other cultural establishments. Every year the city hosts around 100 festivals and various competitions of art and culture, including more than 50 international ones.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

Despite the [[Economic history of the Russian Federation|economic instability of the 1990s]], not a single major theatre or museum was closed in Saint Petersburg; on the contrary many new ones opened, for example a private museum of puppets (opened in 1999) is the third museum of its kind in Russia, where collections of more than 2000 dolls are presented including 'The multinational Saint Petersburg' and Pushkin's Petersburg. The museum world of Saint Petersburg is incredibly diverse. The city is not only home to the world-famous [[Hermitage Museum]] and the [[Russian Museum]] with its rich collection of [[Russian art]], but also the palaces of Saint Petersburg and its suburbs, so-called small town museums and others like the museum of famous Russian writer [[Dostoyevsky]]; Museum of Musical Instruments, the museum of decorative arts and the museum of professional orientation.

The [[Music of Russia|musical life]] of Saint Petersburg is rich and diverse, with the city now playing host to a number of annual carnivals.

Ballet performances occupy a special place in the cultural life of Saint Petersburg. The Petersburg School of Ballet is named as one of the best in the world. Traditions of the Russian classical school have been passed down from generation to generation among outstanding educators. The art of famous and prominent Saint Petersburg dancers like [[Rudolf Nureyev]], [[Natalia Makarova]], [[Mikhail Baryshnikov]] was, and is, admired throughout the world. Contemporary Petersburg ballet is made up not only of traditional Russian classical school, but also ballets by those like [[Boris Eifman]], who expanded the scope of strict classical [[Russian ballet]] to almost unimaginable limits. Remaining faithful to the classical basis (he was a choreographer at the [[Vaganova Academy of Russian Ballet]]), he combined [[classical ballet]] with the [[avant-garde|avant-garde style]], and then, in turn, with acrobatics, rhythmic gymnastics, dramatic expressiveness, [[Cinema of Russia|cinema]], color, light, and finally with spoken word.

==Media and communications==
All major Russian newspapers are active in Saint Petersburg. The city has a developed telecommunications system. In 2014 [[Rostelecom]], the national operator announced it began a major modernization of the fixed-line network in the city.<ref>{{cite web| url =http://www.telecompaper.com/news/rostelecom-to-invest-rub-15-bln-in-st-petersburg--1011519| title =Rostelecom to invest RUB 15 bln in St Petersburg| work =Telecom Paper|date=2 May 2014| access-date = 3 May 2014}}</ref>

{{further|List of museums in Saint Petersburg}}
{{wide image|Hermitage Museum in Saint Petersburg.jpg|600px|The [[State Hermitage Museum]] ([[Hermitage Theatre]], Old Hermitage, Small Hermitage and [[Winter Palace]], all part of the current museum complex)}}
Saint Petersburg is home to more than two hundred museums, many of them in historic buildings. The largest is the [[Hermitage Museum]] that features the interiors of the former imperial residence and a vast collection of art. The [[Russian Museum]] is a large museum devoted to Russian fine art. The apartments of some famous Petersburgers, including [[Alexander Pushkin]], [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]], [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov]], [[Feodor Chaliapin]], [[Alexander Blok]], [[Vladimir Nabokov]], [[Anna Akhmatova]], [[Mikhail Zoshchenko]], [[Joseph Brodsky]], as well as some palace and park ensembles of the southern suburbs and notable architectural monuments such as St. Isaac's Cathedral, have also been turned into public museums.

The [[Kunstkamera]], with its collection established in 1714 by Peter the Great to collect curiosities from all over the world, is sometimes considered the first museum in Russia, which has evolved into the present-day [[Kunstkamera|Peter the Great Museum of Anthropology and Ethnography]]. The [[Russian Ethnography Museum]], which has been split from the Russian Museum, is devoted to the cultures of the people of Russia, the [[Post-Soviet states|former Soviet Union]] and Russian Empire.

A number of museums provide insight into the Soviet history of Saint Petersburg, including the Museum of the Blockade, which describes the [[Siege of Leningrad]] and the Museum of Political History, which explains many authoritarian features of the USSR.

Other notable museums include the [[Central Naval Museum]], and [[Zoological Museum of the Zoological Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences|Zoological Museum]], [[The Central Soil Museum by V. V. Dokuchaev|Central Soil Museum]], the [[Russian Railway Museum]], [[Suvorov Museum]], Museum of the Siege of Leningrad, [[Erarta|Erarta Museum of Contemporary Art]], the largest non-governmental Museum of contemporary art in Russia, [[Saint Petersburg Museum of History]] in the [[Peter and Paul Fortress]] and [[Military Historical Museum of Artillery, Engineers and Signal Corps|Artillery Museum]], which includes not only artillery items, but also a huge collection of other military equipment, uniforms and decorations.

===Music===
[[File:Mariinsky Theatre in Saint Petersburg.jpg|right|thumb|The main auditorium of the Mariinsky Theatre]]

Among the city's more than fifty theatres is the [[Mariinsky Theatre]] (formerly known as the Kirov Theatre), home to the [[Mariinsky Ballet]] company and opera. Leading ballet dancers, such as [[Vaslav Nijinsky]], [[Anna Pavlova]], [[Rudolf Nureyev|Rudolph Nureyev]], [[Mikhail Baryshnikov]], [[Galina Ulanova]] and [[Natalia Makarova]], were principal stars of the Mariinsky ballet.

The first music school, the [[Saint Petersburg Conservatory]], was founded in 1862 by the Russian pianist and composer [[Anton Rubinstein]]. The school alumni have included such notable composers as [[Pyotr Tchaikovsky]], [[Sergei Prokofiev]], [[Artur Kapp]], [[Rudolf Tobias]] and [[Dmitri Shostakovich]], who taught at the conservatory during the 1960s, bringing it additional fame. The renowned Russian composer [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov]] also taught at the conservatory from 1871 to 1905. Among his students were [[Igor Stravinsky]], [[Alexander Glazounov]], [[Anatoly Liadov]] and others. The former St. Petersburg apartment of Rimsky-Korsakov has been faithfully preserved as the [[Rimsky-Korsakov Apartment and Museum|composer's only museum]].

[[File:Shou alie parusa.jpg|left|thumb|[[Scarlet Sails (tradition)|Scarlet Sails]] celebration on the [[Neva|Neva River]]]]
Dmitri Shostakovich, who was born and raised in Saint Petersburg, dedicated his [[Symphony No. 7 (Shostakovich)|Seventh Symphony]] to the city, calling it the "Leningrad Symphony". He wrote the symphony while based in the city during the siege of Leningrad. It was premiered in Samara in March 1942; a few months later, it received its first [[Leningrad première of Shostakovich's Symphony No. 7|performance]] in the besieged Leningrad at the Bolshoy Philharmonic Hall under the baton of conductor [[Karl Eliasberg]]. It was heard over the radio and was said to have lifted the spirits of the surviving population.<ref>{{cite news|author=Close |url=https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2005/oct/16/classicalmusicandopera.russia.stpetersburg |title=Where a symphony silenced guns |work=The Guardian |location=London |date=16 October 2005|access-date=22 October 2009 }}</ref> In 1992, the 7th Symphony was performed by the 14 surviving orchestral players of the Leningrad premiere in the same hall as half a century before.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/life/story/0,6903,605454,00.html |title=Orchestral manoeuvres (part one) |newspaper=The Observer |date=25 November 2001|access-date=22 October 2009 |location=London |first=Ed |last=Vulliamy}}</ref> The [[Saint Petersburg Philharmonic Orchestra|Leningrad Philharmonic Orchestra]] remained one of the best known [[orchestra|symphony orchestras]] in the world under the leadership of conductors [[Yevgeny Mravinsky]] and [[Yuri Temirkanov]]. Mravinsky's term as artistic director of the Leningrad Philharmonic—a term that is possibly the longest of any conductor with any orchestra in modern times—led the orchestra from a little-known provincial ensemble to one of the world's most highly regarded orchestras, especially for the performance of Russian music.

The Imperial Choral Capella was founded and modelled after the royal courts of other European capitals.
[[File:Alexandrinsky Theatre.jpg|thumb|The [[Alexandrinsky Theatre]]]]

Saint Petersburg has been home to the newest movements in [[popular music]] in the country.

===Literature===
[[File:Spb Vasilievsky Island Pushkin House asv2019-09 img10.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Pushkin House]]]]
Saint Petersburg has a longstanding and world famous tradition in literature. [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky|Dostoyevsky]] called it "The most abstract and intentional city in the world", emphasizing its artificiality, but it was also a symbol of modern disorder in a changing Russia. It often appeared to [[List of Russian language writers|Russian writers]] as a menacing and inhuman mechanism. The grotesque and often nightmarish image of the city is featured in Pushkin's last poems, the Petersburg stories of [[Nikolai Gogol|Gogol]], the novels of [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky|Dostoyevsky]], the verse of [[Alexander Blok]] and [[Osip Mandelstam|Osip Mandelshtam]], and in the symbolist novel ''[[Petersburg (novel)|Petersburg]]'' by [[Andrei Bely|Andrey Bely]]. According to Lotman in his chapter, 'The Symbolism of Saint Petersburg' in ''Universe and the Mind'', these writers were inspired by symbolism from within the city itself. The effect of life in Saint Petersburg on the plight of the poor clerk in a society obsessed with hierarchy and status also became an important theme for authors such as [[Alexander Pushkin|Pushkin]], Gogol and Dostoyevsky. Another important feature of early Saint Petersburg literature is its mythical element, which incorporates [[urban legend]]s and popular [[ghost story|ghost stories]], as the stories of Pushkin and Gogol included ghosts returning to Saint Petersburg to haunt other characters as well as other fantastical elements, creating a surreal and abstract image of Saint Petersburg.

20th-century writers from Saint Petersburg, such as [[Vladimir Nabokov]], [[Ayn Rand]], Andrey Bely and [[Yevgeny Zamyatin]], along with his apprentices, The [[Serapion Brothers]] created entire new styles in literature and contributed new insights to the understanding of society through their experience in this city. [[Anna Akhmatova]] became an important leader for [[List of Russian language poets|Russian poetry]]. Her poem ''Requiem'' adumbrates the perils encountered during the Stalinist era. Another notable 20th-century writer from Saint Petersburg is [[Joseph Brodsky]], recipient of the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] (1987). While living in the United States, his writings in English reflected on life in Saint Petersburg from the unique perspective of being both an insider and an outsider to the city in essays such as, "A Guide to a Renamed City" and the nostalgic "In a Room and a Half".<ref>Joseph Brodsky. ''Less Than One: Selected Essays'', 1986</ref>

===Film===

The cult comedy ''[[The Irony of Fate|Irony of Fate]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://traveldk.com/st-petersburg/topten/films-set-in-st-petersburg|title=the irony of fate sat in st.petersburg|access-date=26 August 2009}}</ref> (also Ирония судьбы, или С лёгким паром!) is set in Saint Petersburg and pokes fun at Soviet city planning. The 1985 film ''[[White Nights (1985 film)|White Nights]]'' received considerable Western attention for having captured genuine Leningrad street scenes at a time when filming in the [[Soviet Union]] by Western production companies was generally unheard of. Other movies include ''[[GoldenEye]]'' (1995), ''[[Midnight in Saint Petersburg]]'' (1996), ''[[Brother (1997 film)|Brother]]'' (1997) and [[Tamil cinema|Tamil]] romantic [[thriller (genre)|thriller film]]-''[[Dhaam Dhoom]]'' (2008). ''[[Eugene Onegin#Film|Onegin]]'' (1999) is based on the [[Alexander Pushkin|Pushkin]] poem and showcases many [[tourist attraction]]s. In addition, the Russian romantic comedy, ''[[Piter FM]]'', intricately showcases the cityscape, almost as if it were a main character in the film.

Several international film festivals are held annually, such as the [[Festival of Festivals, Saint Petersburg]], as well as the Message to Man International Documentary Film Festival, since its inauguration in 1988 during the White Nights.<ref name="Message To Man">{{cite web|url=http://m2m.iffc.ru/index_E.htm |title=The XIX International "Message To Man" Film Festival |publisher=IFC Centaur |access-date=9 June 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090515190814/http://m2m.iffc.ru/index_E.htm |archive-date=15 May 2009 }}</ref>

The crime dynamic in Saint Petersburg is tightly associated with the general social situation in the country.

According to official sources the number of crimes committed by foreigners in Saint Petersburg in 2010 increased by 11.1%. Law enforcement authorities consider this was associated with an increased number of people from some [[Commonwealth of Independent States|CIS republics]] who live in Saint Petersburg illegally.<ref name="bare_url">{{cite web|url=http://gov.spb.ru/news7408.html |title=Crime preventing measures have made good results: An official portal of the administration of St. Petersburg |publisher=Gov.spb.ru |date=16 July 2012 |access-date=20 July 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324052941/http://gov.spb.ru/news7408.html |archive-date=24 March 2012 }}</ref> On the other hand, some media reported that in recent years there had been a notable increase in racially motivated violence, in particular towards [[International student|foreign students]].<ref name="Racist">[http://www.rferl.org/featuresarticle/2005/09/F799BAE9-D2BD-4994-AFEA-61DAD5A63BDD.html ''Russia: Racist Attacks Plague St. Petersburg''] [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty|Radio Free Europe]] 30 September 2005</ref> One of the notable [[white supremacy|white supremacist]] groups, ''Belaya Energia'' (White Energy, inspired by US "[[White Power]]" groups) has reportedly been one of the gangs involved in murdering foreign university students.<ref name="Racist"/>

The official portal of the Government of Saint Petersburg provided data on significant improvements in the crime situation.<ref name="bare_url"/> In particular, it was reported the number of crimes against tourists had fallen by more than half during 2009–2011.

In 2012, Canada's Department of Foreign Affairs warned LGBT travellers about a vaguely worded law in Saint Petersburg that came into effect on 17 March 2012, making it a criminal offence to publicize acts of male or female homosexuality, bisexuality, or transgenderism. The intention of the law is to protect minors. A Russian travel advisory on the Foreign Affairs website notes that while homosexuality is legal in Russia (it was decriminalized in 1993), LGBT Canadian travellers should avoid "displaying affection in public, as homosexuals can be targets of violence.... Public actions (including dissemination of information, statements, displays or conspicuous behaviour) contradicting or appearing to contradict this law may lead to arrest, prosecution and the imposition of a fine."<ref>{{cite news|author1=Postmedia News|title=Canada warns gay travellers to Russia on heels of law banning homosexual "propaganda"|url=http://news.nationalpost.com/news/canada/canada-warns-gay-travellers-to-russia-on-heels-of-law-banning-homosexual-propaganda|access-date=13 June 2017|work=National Post|date=16 March 2012}}</ref>
