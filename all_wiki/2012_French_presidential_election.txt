A '''presidential election''' was held in [[France]] on 22 April 2012 (or 21 April in some overseas departments and territories), with a second round [[Two-round system|run-off]] held on 6 May (or 5 May for those same territories) to elect the [[President of France]] (who is also ''ex officio'' one of the [[Co-Princes of Andorra|two joint heads of state]] of Andorra, a sovereign state). The incumbent [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] was running for a second successive and, under the terms of the [[Constitution of France|constitution]], final term in the election.

The first round ended with the selection of [[François Hollande]] and Nicolas Sarkozy as second round participants, as neither of them received a majority of votes cast in the first round. Hollande won the runoff with 51.64% of the vote to Sarkozy's 48.36%.<ref>Ministère de l'Interieur: [http://elections.interieur.gouv.fr/PR2012/FE.html Élection Présidentielle 2012, Résultats 2nd tour]</ref>

The presidential election was followed by a [[2012 French legislative election|legislative election]] in June.

[[Europe Écologie–The Greens]] (EELV) held a primary to choose its candidate. The vote was open to all members of the party and of the [[Independent Ecological Movement]]. There were four candidates. The first round was held on 29 June 2011. [[Eva Joly]], a member of EELV and a former [[examining magistrate]], obtained 49.75% of the vote, ahead of independent candidate and environmental campaigner [[Nicolas Hulot]] (40.22%). The other two candidates, [[Henri Stoll]] and [[Stéphane Lhomme]], obtained 5.02% and 4.44% respectively.

===Campaign===
The official campaign began on 20 March, but in the wake of the [[2012 Midi-Pyrénées shootings|shooting at the Ozar Hatorah day school]] in [[Toulouse]] the two leading candidates, Hollande and Sarkozy, suspended their campaigns.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/election-presidentielle-2012/article/2012/03/19/fusillade-de-toulouse-la-classe-politique-exprime-son-emotion_1671861_1471069.html|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120319171823/http://www.lemonde.fr/election-presidentielle-2012/article/2012/03/19/fusillade-de-toulouse-la-classe-politique-exprime-son-emotion_1671861_1471069.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=19 March 2012|title=Fusillade de Toulouse : pour le PS, "la campagne est suspendue"|work=Le Monde  |date=19 March 2012|language=French}}</ref> Although Jean-Luc Mélenchon argued that to continue with the campaign was "an act of moral, emotional and intellectual resistance."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ladepeche.fr/article/2012/03/20/1310690-toulouse-montauban-poursuivre-la-campagne-un-acte-de-resistance-pour-melenchon.html|title=Poursuivre la campagne, "un acte de résistance" pour Mélenchon|language=French}}</ref> In some parts of the media, Sarkozy and Le Pen were also criticised for misusing the [[2012 Midi-Pyrénées shootings|Midi-Pyrénées shootings]] as campaign fodder against "radical Islam."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/europe/2012/04/20124535636544797.html |title=Greek unrest over pensioner suicide |publisher=Al Jazeera English |accessdate=6 May 2012}}</ref>

====François Hollande====
{{main page|François Hollande presidential campaign, 2012}}
[[File:Hollande 089 (cropped).JPG|thumb|left|Hollande campaigning]]
[[François Hollande]], the candidate of the [[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist Party]] and the [[Radical Party of the Left]], topped the opinion polls throughout the campaign. He emphasised his promise to be a "normal" president, in contrast to Nicolas Sarkozy's sometimes controversial presidential style. He aimed to resorb France's national debt by 2017, notably by cancelling tax cuts for the wealthy and tax exemptions introduced by President Sarkozy. Income tax would be raised to 75% for incomes beyond one million euros; the retirement age would be brought back to 60 (with a full pension) for persons who have worked 42 years; 60 000 jobs cut by Nicolas Sarkozy in public education would be recreated. Homosexual couples would have the right to marry and adopt. Residents without European Union passports would be given the right to vote in local elections after five years of legal residency. On housing, he has promised to regulate rises in rent; to use punitive measures to compel towns and cities to apply the 2000 Law on Solidarity and Urban Renewal ([[:fr:Loi relative à la solidarité et au renouvellement urbains|French article on the law]]), which mandates the providing of social housing; and to provide public lands for the building of social housing. Hollande won the election, finishing first on the first balloting of ten candidates in April with 28.63% of the vote, and again finishing first on the runoff ballot between himself and Sarkozy with 51.64% against Sarkozy's 48.36%.<ref>[http://www.interieur.gouv.fr/Elections/Les-resultats/Presidentielles/elecresult__PR2012/%28path%29/PR2012/FE.html Résultats de l'élection présidentielle 2012, Ministère de l'Intérieur, official results]</ref>

====Nicolas Sarkozy====
Nicolas Sarkozy, the incumbent president and candidate of the [[Union for a Popular Movement]], was aiming for a second and last term in office. He was consistently second in opinion polls throughout the campaign, behind François Hollande. His reforms during his first term included a reform of universities, and of the retirement age; a reform enabling citizens to query the [[constitutionality]] of laws; and a reduction in the number of public sector employees. He argued that his reforms had helped steer France through a period of economic crisis.

[[File:Meeting Sarkozy, place de la Concorde, 15 avril 2012 (3).jpg|thumb|right|Sarkozy rally at [[Place de la Concorde]]]]
Sarkozy's campaign pledges for his potential second term are described by ''Le Monde'' as "anchored on the right". He has promised to reduce legal immigration by 50%; threatened to withdraw France from the [[Schengen Area]] unless it were revised to enable stricter border controls; promised to compel beneficiaries of the [[Revenu de solidarité active]] to accept certain jobs, in exchange for support in finding them; and opposed Hollande's proposals in favour of gay marriage and voting rights for foreign residents in local elections. He has also promised more frequent referenda, for citizens to be consulted on major issues.

Sarkozy admitted during the campaign that he did not visit [[Fukushima, Fukushima|Fukushima]] while in Japan after [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami|the previous year's earthquake and tsunami]], despite having previously said he had done so.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-17700791|title=France's Nicolas Sarkozy admits Fukushima nuclear gaffe|work=BBC News |publisher=BBC|date=13 April 2012|accessdate=13 April 2012}}</ref>

====Marine Le Pen====
{{main page|Marine Le Pen presidential campaign, 2012}}
[[File:Meeting 1er mai 2012 Front National, Paris (15) (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|Le Pen campaigning]]
[[Marine Le Pen]] is the candidate of the [[National Front (France)|National Front]], succeeding her father [[Jean-Marie Le Pen]], who was a candidate in five presidential elections. Aiming to reach the second round, as her father had done in 2002, she also attempted to provide a different image of the party, avoiding the controversial statements previously made by her father. She has advocated "national preference" for French citizens (over foreign residents) for access to jobs and social services, and a form of protectionism, as well as withdrawing from the euro and the European Union. She has advocated reducing legal immigration by 95%, abolishing the right to [[family reunification]], and reinstating the death penalty, abolished in 1981 by then president [[François Mitterrand]]. She held the third place in opinion polls for much of the campaign, occasionally rising into first and second place in 2011 or dipping to fourth behind Jean-Luc Mélenchon, but remained consistently behind Hollande and Sarkozy by 2012. She finished the 2012 balloting with 17.90% of the vote tally, placing her third in the final results.<ref>[http://www.interieur.gouv.fr/Elections/Les-resultats/Presidentielles/elecresult__PR2012/%28path%29/PR2012/FE.html Résultats de l'élection présidentielle 2012, Ministère de l'Intérieur, retrieved 7 November 2015]</ref>

====Jean-Luc Mélenchon====
[[File:Front de Gauche - Fête de l'Humanité 2012 - 002 (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|Mélenchon campaigning]]

[[Jean-Luc Mélenchon]] is the candidate of the [[Left Front (France)|Left Front]], which includes in particular the [[French Communist Party]] and the [[Left Party (France)|Left Party]]. (He is a member of the latter.) He has been described as the surprise or revelation of the campaign, with his level of support in opinion polls rising from 5% in October 2011 to around 15% (and sometimes up to 17%) by the end of the campaign. He finished in the first round of balloting with 11.10% of the national electorate, placing him fourth in the field of 10 ♠s.<ref>[http://www.interieur.gouv.fr/Elections/Les-resultats/Presidentielles/elecresult__PR2012/%28path%29/PR2012/FE.html Résultats de l'élection présidentielle 2012, Ministère de l'Interieur, Republic of France, retrieved 17 November 2015]</ref> He inaugurated the practice of giant open-air meetings, which the two leading candidates then adopted in turn. A former French teacher, he was noted for his eloquent style and oratory, but also for his argumentative relationship with journalists, and occasional insults; he notably described Marine Le Pen as "half-demented". He proposed raising the minimum wage to €1,700; setting a maximum wage differential of 1 to 20 in all businesses, so that employers wishing to increase their own salaries would also have to increase those of their employees; setting social and environmental norms which businesses would have to respect in order to receive public subsidies; supporting [[social enterprise]]s through [[government procurement]]; taxing imports which do not meet certain social and environmental norms; and reestablishing 60 as the legal retirement age with a full pension. There would be an "ecological planification" towards a [[green economy|green, sustainable economy]], backed by a "green rule" (''règle verte'') to be inscribed in the Constitution. On tax, he has proposed a progressive taxation, with higher taxes on the wealthy and a 100% tax rate beyond an income of €360,000 (thereby creating a [[maximum wage]]); expatriate French nationals established in a country with a lower tax rate than in France would pay the difference in tax in France. Businesses creating jobs, paying higher wages and/or providing training would receive tax cuts. Healthcare costs would be fully reimbursed by the state, and the [[right to die]] would be recognised. The right to abortion would be secured through inclusion in the Constitution. Homosexual couples would have the right to marry and adopt. Naturalisation of foreign residents would be facilitated, and foreign residents would have the right to vote in local elections. A [[Constitutional convention (political meeting)|constitutional convention]] would be assembled, with an aim in particular to increase the prerogatives of Parliament and diminish the powers of the President; all elections would be based on [[proportional representation]], with gender parity.

====François Bayrou====
[[File:Francois Bayrou-IMG 4432 (cropped).JPG|thumb|left|Bayrou campaigning]]
[[François Bayrou]] was the candidate of the [[Democratic Movement (France)|Democratic Movement]], which he founded in 2007. He is one of only two candidates to stand in both the 2007 and 2012 elections (the other being Nicolas Sarkozy); he obtained 18.57% of the vote in 2007, finishing third. In the 2012 election he received 9.13% of the vote in the first round of balloting, finishing fifth.<ref>[http://www.interieur.gouv.fr/Elections/Les-resultats/Presidentielles/elecresult__PR2012/%28path%29/PR2012/FE.html Résultats de l'élection présidentielle 2012, French Ministry of the Interior, retrieved Tuesday, 17 November 2015]</ref> He stands for an independent [[centrism|centre]] in politics, which he has sought to distinguish clearly both from the left and the right. Describing France as being "in a critical state", he has focused on reducing the country's national debt, through a public spending freeze, cuts to [[tax exemption]]s, and a raise in taxes ([[Value added tax]] and taxes on the wealthy). On education, he has proposed that half the time in primary school should be dedicated to the mastering of reading and writing.

====Eva Joly====
{{main page|Eva Joly presidential campaign, 2012}}
[[File:Eva Joly (6916945837) (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|Joly campaigning]]
[[Eva Joly]] was the candidate of [[Europe Écologie–The Greens]]. Before entering politics for this election, she was a known public figure, as the [[examining magistrate]] in criminal corruption cases involving powerful companies or individuals – notably the [[Elf Aquitaine]] oil company, the [[Crédit Lyonnais]] bank or businessman and politician [[Bernard Tapie]]. (See: [[Elf affair]] [[:fr:Affaire Elf|(fr)]].) She is also the first foreign-born person to stand for the French presidency; born in Norway, she is a naturalized French citizen. She focused her campaign not only on the environment but also on social issues, describing herself as the representative of the "reasonable" or "realistic" left, and on denouncing discrimination against ethnic and religious minorities. Homosexual couples would be given the right to marry and adopt, and foreign residents would have the right to vote in all elections. She suggested that the "[[green economy|ecological transformation of the economy]]" would create 600 000 jobs over the next five years. An agreement signed between her party and the Socialist Party contained a clause on the closing of nuclear reactors; in the final stages of the campaign, when François Hollande announced it would not be upheld, she expressed the hope she could still convince him. She also drew attention by accusing Nicolas Sarkozy of having obtained illicit funding for his previous campaign; critics accused her of ignoring the [[presumption of innocence]], and Sarkozy himself replied that he "despised" her accusations. Known for her bright red glasses, which she symbolically switched for bright green ones, she was described by the press as struggling with her campaign, barely reaching 3% in opinion polls.

====Nicolas Dupont-Aignan====
[[File:Discours à l'institut de la justice (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|Dupont-Aignan campaigning]]
[[Nicolas Dupont-Aignan]], described as an "anti-euro [[souverainism|souverainist]]", is the candidate of [[Arise the Republic]], a party he founded in 2008. He has advocated leaving the euro on grounds of economic well-being, and the [[European Union]] "in its current form", which he describes as "already dead" and leading to "economic ruin and social regression". He has called for an "intelligent protectionism", with tariffs on imports that result from "human slavery"; and tax cuts for businesses that reinvest their profits in France. He has described himself as a [[Gaullism|Gaullist]].

====Philippe Poutou====
[[File:Philippe Poutou 12 janvier (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|Poutou campaigning]]
[[Philippe Poutou]], a worker in a car factory, is the candidate of the [[New Anticapitalist Party]], succeeding [[Olivier Besancenot]]. For much of the campaign, he remained little known to the general public; he was described as lacking Besancenot's popularity, charisma and ease with words. Freely admitting that he did not particularly want to be a candidate, and that he did not aim to be elected (particularly as one of his policies was to abolish the function of president, in favour of a fully parliamentary system), he saw his profile and popularity increase somewhat in the late stages of the campaign, when all candidates obtained equal airtime in the media. In particular, his unconventional behaviour drew attention during the television programme ''Des paroles et des actes'' [[:fr:Des paroles et des actes|(fr)]], along with his unusual campaign clips – such as one based on the film ''[[The Artist (film)|The Artist]]''.<ref>[http://www.lemonde.fr/election-presidentielle-2012/article/2012/04/12/et-philippe-poutou-creva-soudain-l-ecran_1684105_1471069.html "Et Philippe Poutou creva soudain l'écran..."], ''Le Monde'', 12 April 2012</ref><ref>[http://www.ladepeche.fr/article/2012/04/20/1335356-philippe-poutou-est-the-anticapitaliste.html "Philippe Poutou est... "The Anticapitaliste""], ''La Dépêche'', 20 April 2012</ref> Like Nathalie Arthaud, his message was that improvements in workers' rights would come through workers' struggles and demands rather than through the ballot box.

[[Nathalie Arthaud]], a teacher of economics and management in a secondary school, is the candidate of [[Workers' Struggle]]. She succeeds famous [[perennial candidate]] [[Arlette Laguiller]], who represented the party in six consecutive presidential elections, from [[1974 French presidential election|1974]] to 2007. A [[Trotskyism|Trotskyist]], she has described herself as the "only communist candidate" in the election. She has stated that she does not aim to be elected, describing elections as "inessential", and considering that workers will obtain new rights only through their struggles rather than through the ballot box.

====Jacques Cheminade====
[[Jacques Cheminade]] is the candidate of his Solidarity and Progress movement, the French branch of the [[LaRouche movement]]. Described as a "conspiracy theorist" by the press, he drew some attention with his proposals for an expanded [[space programme]], and stagnated slightly above 0% in the opinion polls.

He also said that there would be a presumption of self-defense when police are involved in the killing of suspects and criticised the EU's lack of mention of Europe's Christian roots in its constitution. Many of the issues were similar to that of the National Front, from which Sarkozy's UMP gained votes between the [[2002 French presidential election|2002]] and [[2007 French presidential election|2007]] election.

;International effect
The campaign has led to a "certain degree of gridlock in EU‘s corridors of power". It's unclear who will be the head of the [[Euro Group]], who will join the Executive Board of the [[European Central Bank]] (ECB) and who will lead the [[European Stability Mechanism]] (ESM).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.europeonline-magazine.eu/gridlock-in-eus-corridors_207463.html|title=Gridlock in EU's corridors|work=Europe Online Magazine |date=4 May 2012}}</ref>

===Endorsements===
In the days before the election, editorials in the main newspapers expressed opinions about the two candidates. ''[[Le Monde]]'' did not explicitly support one or the other, but wrote that Hollande "has confirmed, between the two rounds, his consistency, albeit without addressing the vagueness of some of his own proposals", while Sarkozy "has demonstrated his inconsistency, first running after the National Front, crossing the red line which had been set at the turn of the 1980s, and respected since then in the ranks of the republican right, before moving back towards the centre to avoid a breakdown with his own side".<ref>[http://www.lemonde.fr/idees/article/2012/05/04/vivre-ensemble_1695879_3232.html "Editorial : "Vivre ensemble""], ''Le Monde'', 4 May 2012</ref> ''[[Libération]]'' supported Hollande:<ref>[http://www.liberation.fr/politiques/2012/05/04/votez_816553 "Votez"], ''Libération'', 4 May 2012</ref>
{{quote|On the right, Nicolas Sarkozy has kept up a strategy of tension, leading his side into a transgression of its founding values. Whatever the outcome of the vote, the political landscape will remain, as a consequence, marked by a lasting and dangerous change. On the left, François Hollande has demonstrated that another vision of politics, another way of conceiving the State, another European politics are not only possible but within sight. And that, to finish, justice must be the cardinal virtue of societies such as ours, marked by a deep crisis and anger.}}
''[[Le Figaro]]'' published an editorial in support of Sarkozy.<ref>[http://www.lefigaro.fr/mon-figaro/2012/05/04/10001-20120504ARTFIG00748-le-destin-de-la-france.php "Le destin de la France"], [[Etienne Mougeotte]], ''Le Figaro'', 4 May 2012</ref>

Of the candidates who went out in the first round, Bayrou, Joly and Cheminade all explicitly declared their support for Hollande in the second round, while Mélenchon and Poutou implicitly endorsed a vote for Hollande by urging their supporters to vote against Sarkozy. Dupont-Aignan backed Sarkozy, while Le Pen and Arthaud declined to support either candidate.

===Debates===
There was one televised debate between Hollande and Sarkozy, although Sarkozy said he would prefer three,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ntn24.com/news/news/hollande-rejects-sarkozy-chall-12749 |title=Hollande rejects Sarkozy challenge to hold three TV debates |publisher=NTN24.com |date=22 April 2012 |accessdate=26 April 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120430053618/http://www.ntn24.com/news/news/hollande-rejects-sarkozy-chall-12749 |archive-date=30 April 2012 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> an idea Hollande rejected.

==Voting in overseas departments and territories==
In [[overseas departments and territories of France]] located west of [[metropolitan France]] ([[Saint Pierre and Miquelon]], [[Collectivity of Saint Martin|Saint Martin]], [[Saint Barthélemy]], [[Guadeloupe]], [[Martinique]], [[French Guiana]], and [[French Polynesia]]), voting takes place a day early, so that citizens in those territories and departments do not find themselves voting after the initial announcement of results. This is also the case for French residents in foreign countries west of metropolitan France. Some of these communities are remote; [[French Guiana#Demographics|Amerindians in French Guiana]], who are French citizens, "sometimes live more than three hours away by canoe from their ballot box", particularly in the large remote [[communes of France|commune]] of [[Maripasoula]]. The electoral campaign papers sent to these voters, however, reportedly indicated 22 April as the day of the election, instead of 21 April.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.liberation.fr/politiques/2012/04/22/guyane-en-taxi-pirogue-vers-les-buraux-de-vote_813411 |title=Guyane: en taxi-pirogue vers les bureaux de vote |work=Libération |date=22 April 2012 |accessdate=6 May 2012}}</ref>

[[French law]] sets a [[Blackout (broadcasting)|blackout]] of the release of [[exit poll]]s until the last polling station is closed at 20:00, with fines of up to €75,000. However, the result was leaked on ''Twitter'', circumventing the law with code names: "[[Flan (pie)|Flan]]by" for Hollande, "le [[wikt:nain|nain]]" (midget) for Sarkozy, Titanic for Marine Le Pen, or [[tomato|Tomate]] for Mélenchon, as well as other humorous names and metaphors were also used such as Amsterdam (for Hollande), Budapest (for Sarkozy, who has Hungarian heritage), Berlin (for Le Pen, due to the Nazi past of Germany) and Moscow (for Mélenchon, due to the Communist past of Russia). The [[hashtag]] #RadioLondres was used as it recalls the coded messages from [[World War II]] sent by ''[[Radio Londres]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://leplus.nouvelobs.com/contribution/537611-presidentielle-radio-londres-quand-twitter-detourne-la-loi-electorale-avec-humour.html |work=Nouvelobs |title="Radio Londres": quand Twitter détourne la loi électorale avec humour |publisher=Leplus.nouvelobs.com |accessdate=22 April 2012}}</ref> EU-based media outlets not subject to the French blackout law reported early exit poll results before closure of the polls, in both rounds of the election.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.repubblica.it/esteri/2012/05/06/news/francia_risultati-34565294/|title=Francia, François Hollande è il nuovo presidente|date=6 May 2012|work=la Repubblica |language=Italian|trans-title=France, François Hollande is the new president}} (Content and title since updated).</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lesoir.be/dossiers_speciaux/special2/2012-05-06/francois-hollande-elu-president-de-la-republique-913937.php|title=François Hollande élu Président de la République|publisher=[[Le Soir]]|location=Belgium|language=French|date=6 May 2012|trans-title=François Hollande elected President of the Republic}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=Email Us |url=https://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/finance/2012/0426/1224315193035.html |title=Ban on French election exit polls ignored as digital media knows no frontiers – The Irish Times – Thu, Apr 26, 2012 |work=The Irish Times  |date=26 April 2012}}</ref> Olivier Cimelière reported that some people saw a risk of manipulating future elections.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://leplus.nouvelobs.com/contribution/537774-twitter-et-radio-londres-tricherie-electorale-ou-vrai-defi-democratique.html |work=Nouvelobs |title=Cheating or true democratical challenge? |publisher=Leplus.nouvelobs.com |accessdate=22 April 2012}}</ref>

Sarkozy called for UMP to "stay together. We must win the battle of the legislatives" and said that "in this new era, I will remain one of you, but my place will no longer be the same. My engagement with the life of my country will now be different, but time will never strain the bonds between us." Hollande then spoke at a victory rally in [[Tulle]] where he said:

{{cquote|To those who haven't voted for me, let them know that I hear them, and that I will be president to all. There is one France, united in the same destiny. We will never be apart, how beautiful life is tonight!}}

He then travelled to Paris, where supporters of the Socialist Party gathered outside the headquarters.<ref name="aljazresult">{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/europe/2012/05/201256172746159731.html |title=Hollande wins French presidency – Europe |publisher=Al Jazeera English |date=4 October 2011 |accessdate=6 May 2012}}</ref> He also said that "Europe is watching us.
