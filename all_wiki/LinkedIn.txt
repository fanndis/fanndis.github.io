On June 13, 2016, [[Microsoft]] announced that it would acquire LinkedIn for $196 a share, a total value of $26.2 billion and the largest [[List of mergers and acquisitions by Microsoft|acquisition made by Microsoft]] to date. The acquisition would be an all-cash, debt-financed transaction. Microsoft would allow LinkedIn to "retain its distinct brand, culture and independence", with Weiner to remain as CEO, who would then report to Microsoft CEO [[Satya Nadella]]. Analysts believed Microsoft saw the opportunity to integrate LinkedIn with its [[Microsoft Office|Office product suite]] to help better integrate the professional network system with its [[Product (business)|products]]. The deal was completed on December 8, 2016.<ref name="wsj ms">{{cite news |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/microsoft-to-acquire-linkedin-in-deal-valued-at-26-2-billion-1465821523 |title=Microsoft to Acquire LinkedIn for $26.2 Billion |date=June 13, 2016 |work=[[Wall Street Journal]] |last2=Steele |first2=Anne |first1=Jay |last1=Greene |accessdate=June 13, 2016}}</ref>

Soon after LinkedIn's acquisition by Microsoft, on January 19, 2017, LinkedIn's new desktop version was introduced.<ref name="LinkedIn Corporate Communications Team">LinkedIn Corporate Communications Team for LinkedIn Newsroom. Jan. 19, 2017 [https://press.linkedin.com/site-resources/news-releases/2017/introducing-the-new-linkedin-desktop Introducing the New LinkedIn Desktop]</ref> The new version was meant to make the user experience seamless across mobile and desktop. Some of the changes were made according to the feedback received from the previously launched mobile app. Features that were not heavily used were removed. For example, the contact tagging and filtering features are not supported any more.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/72331?lang=en|title=Filtering and Tagging Connections Feature – No Longer Available|date=February 2, 2017|website=LinkedIn Help Pages}}</ref>

Following the launch of the new [[user interface]] (UI), some users, complained about the missing features which were there in the older version, slowness, and bugs in it. The issues were faced by both free and premium users, and with both the desktop version and the mobile version of the site.

In 2019, LinkedIn launched globally the feature Open for Business<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ppc.land/linkedin-rolls-out-open-for-business-globally/|title=LinkedIn rolls out Open for Business globally|date=2019-11-04|website=PPC Land|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-05}}</ref> that enables freelancers to be discovered on the platform.

=== Perkins lawsuit ===
In 2013, a [[class action]] [[lawsuit]] entitled ''Perkins vs. LinkedIn Corp'' was filed against the company, accusing it of automatically sending invitations to contacts in a member's [[email address]] book without permission. The court agreed with LinkedIn that permission had in fact been given for invitations to be sent, but ''not'' for the two further reminder [[email]]s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pacermonitor.com/view/XKUTHYA/Perkins_et_al_v_LinkedIn_Corporation__candce-13-04303__0001.0.pdf |title=PacerMonitor Document View – 5:13-cv-04303 – Perkins et al v.

=== ''hiQ Labs v. LinkedIn'' ===
{{main|hiQ Labs v. LinkedIn}}

In May 2017, LinkedIn sent a Cease-And-Desist letter to hiQ Labs, a Silicon Valley startup that collects data from public profiles and provides analysis of this data to its customers. The letter demanded that hiQ immediately cease "scraping" data from LinkedIn's servers, claiming violations of the CFAA (Computer Fraud and Abuse Act) and the DMCA (Digital Millennium Copyright Act).

In response, hiQ sued LinkedIn in the Northern District of California in San Francisco, asking the court to prohibit LinkedIn from blocking its access to public profiles while the court considered the merits of its request. The court served a preliminary injunction against LinkedIn, which was then forced to allow hiQ to continue to collect public data. LinkedIn appealed this ruling; in September 2019, the appeals court rejected LinkedIn's arguments and the preliminary injunction was upheld.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.techburtoff.in/2020/04/linkedin-learning.html

== Platform and features ==

=== User profile network ===
====Basic functionality====
The basic functionality of LinkedIn allows users to create [[User profile|profiles]], which for employees typically consist of a [[curriculum vitae]] describing their work experience, education and training, skills, and a personal photo. Employers can list [[job]]s and search for potential candidates. Users can [[Job hunting|find jobs]], people and business opportunities recommended by someone in one's contact network. Users can save jobs that they would like to [[Application for employment|apply]] for. Users also have the ability to follow different companies.

The site also enables members to make "connections" to each other in an [[Online and offline|online]] [[social network]] which may represent real-world [[Business relations|professional relationships]]. Members can invite anyone to become a connection. Users can obtain introductions to the connections of connections (termed ''second-degree connections'') and connections of second-degree connections (termed ''third-degree connections'').

A member's list of connections can be used in a number of ways. For example, users can search for second-degree connections who work at a company they are interested in, and then ask a specific first-degree connection in common for an introduction.<ref name="SecondDegreeConnections">{{cite news |last=Spiegel |first=Linda |title=How Job Hunters Should Use LinkedIn Second-Degree Connections |url=https://blogs.wsj.com/experts/2016/06/01/how-job-hunters-should-use-linkedin-second-degree-connections/ |date=June 1, 2016 |work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |accessdate=June 27, 2016}}</ref> The "gated-access approach" (where contact with any professional requires either an existing relationship, or the intervention of a contact of theirs) is intended to build trust among the service's users. LinkedIn participated in the EU's [[International Safe Harbor Privacy Principles]].<ref name=":1">{{cite web |url=https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/62533/eu-data-transfers?lang=en |title=EU Data Transfers {{!}} LinkedIn Help|website=www.linkedin.com|language=en|access-date=2017-12-21}}</ref>

Users can interact with each other in a variety of ways:
* Connections can interact by choosing to "like" posts and "congratulate" others on updates such as birthdays, anniversaries and new positions, as well as by direct messaging.
* Users can share video with text and filters with the introduction of LinkedIn Video.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://blog.linkedin.com/2017/august/22/Introducing-LinkedIn-Video-Show-Your-Experience-and-Perspective |title=Introducing LinkedIn Video: Show Your Experience and Perspective |website=blog.linkedin.com |language=en-us |access-date=2017-12-01}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.adweek.com/digital/linkedin-just-launched-some-snapchat-like-features-for-video-creators/ |title=LinkedIn Just Launched Some Snapchat-Like Features for Video Creators |access-date=2018-03-20 |language=en-US}}</ref>
* Users can write posts and articles<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.linkedin.com/post/new |title=Linkedin Publishing |website=www.linkedin.com |access-date=2017-12-01}}</ref> within the LinkedIn platform to share with their network.

Since September 2012, LinkedIn has enabled users to "endorse" each other's skills. However, there is no way of flagging anything other than positive content.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.networkcomputing.com/networking/what-linkedin-endorsements-mean-to-you/a/d-id/1106795|title=What endorsements mean|publisher=NetworkComputing|accessdate=29 April 2014}}</ref> LinkedIn solicits endorsements using [[algorithm]]s that generate skills members might have. Members cannot opt out of such solicitations, with the result that it sometimes appears that a member is soliciting an endorsement for a non-existent skill.<ref>{{cite news|last=Taub|first=Eric A.|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/05/technology/personaltech/the-path-to-happy-employment-contact-by-contact-on-linkedin.html|title=The Path to Happy Employment, Contact by Contact on LinkedIn|date=December 4, 2013|work=The New York Times}}</ref>

=== Applications ===
LinkedIn 'applications' often refers to external third party applications that interact with LinkedIn's developer API. However, in some cases, it could refer to sanctioned applications featured on a user's profile page.

==== External, third party applications ====
On February 12, 2015, LinkedIn released an updated terms of use for their developer API.<ref>[https://developer.linkedin.com/legal/api-terms-of-use ''Terms of Use''], LinkedIn, February 12, 2015</ref> The developer API allows both companies and individuals the ability to interact with LinkedIn's data through creation of managed third party applications. Applications must go through a review process and request permission from the user before accessing a user's data.

Normal use of the API is outlined in LinkedIn's developer documents,<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://developer.linkedin.com/ |title = Developers &#124; Linkedin}}</ref> including:
* Sign into external services using LinkedIn
* Add items or attributes to a user profile
* Share items or articles to user's timeline

==== Embedded in profile ====
In October 2008, LinkedIn enabled an "applications platform" which allows external online services to be embedded within a member's profile page. Among the initial applications were an [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]] Reading List that allows LinkedIn members to display books they are reading, a connection to Tripit, and a [[Six Apart]], [[WordPress]] and [[TypePad]] application that allows members to display their latest blog postings within their LinkedIn profile.<ref>[http://www.businessweek.com/the_thread/techbeat/archives/2008/10/linkedin_launch.html ''Facebook in a Suit: LinkedIn Launches Applications Platform''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090123190641/http://www.businessweek.com/the_thread/techbeat/archives/2008/10/linkedin_launch.html |date=January 23, 2009 }}, Business Week, October 28, 2008</ref> In November 2010, LinkedIn allowed businesses to list products and services on company profile pages; it also permitted LinkedIn members to "recommend" products and services and write reviews.<ref>[http://www.clickz.com/clickz/news/1866328/linkedin-adopts-recommend "LinkedIn Adopts 'Recommend' Over 'Like'"], Clickz.com, November 2, 2010</ref> Shortly after, some of the external services were no longer supported, including Amazon's Reading List.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}

=== Mobile ===
A mobile version of the site was launched in February 2008 and made available in six languages: Chinese, English, French, German, Japanese and Spanish.<ref>{{cite news |publisher=tweakers.net |url=http://life.tweakers.net/nieuws/52094/social-networkingsite-linkedin-introduceert-mobiele-versie.html |title=Social-networking site LinkedIN introduces mobile version |accessdate=February 25, 2008}}</ref> In January 2011, LinkedIn acquired CardMunch, a [[mobile app]] maker that scans [[business card]]s and converts into contacts.<ref>[http://shoutex.com/blog/cardmunch-iphone-app-for-business-users/ ''CardMunch acquired by LinkedIn''], shoutEx.com Feb 2011</ref> In June 2013, CardMunch was noted as an available LinkedIn app.<ref name=hempel2013 /> In August 2011, LinkedIn revamped its mobile applications.

LinkedIn also supports the formation of interest groups, and as of March 29, 2012 there are 1,248,019 such groups whose membership varies from 1 to 744,662.<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite web |url=http://www.linkedin.com/groupsDirectory?results=&pplSearchOrigin=GLHD&keywords= |title=Groups Directory |publisher=LinkedIn |accessdate=December 8, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |publisher=i-newswire.com |url=http://www.i-newswire.com/world-s-largest-linkedin-group/160028 |title=World's Largest LinkedIn Group Breaks The 700,000 Member mark |accessdate=February 28, 2012}}</ref> Groups support a limited form of discussion area, moderated by the group owners and managers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://socialmediatoday.com/mark-lerner/2070731/how-avoid-linkedin-s-site-wide-automatic-moderation |title=How to Avoid LinkedIn's Site Wide Automatic Moderation (SWAM) |website=Socialmediatoday.com |accessdate=October 17, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140627130825/http://socialmediatoday.com/mark-lerner/2070731/how-avoid-linkedin-s-site-wide-automatic-moderation |archive-date=June 27, 2014 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all}}</ref> Groups may be private, accessible to members only or may be open to Internet users in general to read, though they must join in order to post messages.

=== Knowledge graph ===
LinkedIn maintains an internal knowledge graph of entities (people, organizations, groups) that helps it connect everyone working in a field or at an organization or network.  This can be used to query the neighborhood around each entity to find updates that might be related to it.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Building The LinkedIn Knowledge Graph|url=https://engineering.linkedin.com/blog/2016/10/building-the-linkedin-knowledge-graph|access-date=2020-07-01|website=engineering.linkedin.com|language=en}}</ref>
This also lets them train machine learning models that can infer new properties about an entity, or new information that may apply to it, for both summary views and for analytics.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Machine Learning in LinkedIn Knowledge Graph|url=https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/machine-learning-linkedin-knowledge-graph-qi-he|access-date=2020-07-01|website=www.linkedin.com|language=en}}</ref>

=== Discontinued features ===
In January 2013, LinkedIn dropped support for LinkedIn Answers and cited a new 'focus on development of new and more engaging ways to share and discuss professional topics across LinkedIn' as the reason for the retirement of the feature. The feature had been launched in 2007 and allowed users to post question to their network and allowed users to rank answers.

On September 1, 2014, LinkedIn retired InMaps, a feature which allowed you to visualize your professional network.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2014/09/01/linkedin-is-quietly-retiring-network-visualization-tool-inmaps/|title=LinkedIn Is Quietly Retiring Network Visualization Tool InMaps|accessdate=27 November 2017}}</ref> The feature had been in use since January 2011.

According to the company's website, LinkedIn Referrals will no longer be available after May 18, 2018.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Joel|first1=CHEESMAN|url=https://www.ere.net/linkedin-referrals-closing-down/|title=LinkedIn Referrals Set to Close Down Later This Month|date=May 1, 2018|work=ERE}}</ref>

LinkedIn allows professionals to build exposure for their personal brand within the site itself as well as in the World Wide Web as a whole. With a tool that LinkedIn dubs a ''Profile Strength Meter'', the site encourages users to offer enough information in their profile to optimize [[search engine optimization|visibility by search engines]].

===Job seeking===
LinkedIn is widely used by job seekers and employers. According to Jack Meyer, the site has become the "premier digital platform" for professionals to network online.<ref name="twsTheStreet111" /> In Australia, which has approximately twelve million working professionals, ten million of them are on LinkedIn, according to Anastasia Santoreneos, suggesting that the probability was high that one's "future employer is probably on the site."<ref name="twsYahooFinance113">{{cite web|url=https://au.finance.yahoo.com/news/how-to-use-linkedin-to-guarantee-you-get-the-job-022554090.html|title=How to use LinkedIn to guarantee you get your dream job|last=Santoreneos|first=Anastasia|date=August 1, 2019|publisher=Yahoo!

LinkedIn allows users to research companies, non-profit organizations, and governments they may be interested in working for. Typing the name of a company or organization in the search box causes pop-up data about the company or organization to appear. Such data may include the ratio of female to male employees, the percentage of the most common titles/positions held within the company, the location of the company's headquarters and offices, and a list of present and former employees. In July 2011, LinkedIn launched a new feature allowing companies to include an "Apply with LinkedIn" button on job listing pages.<ref name="Plugin">Colleen Taylor, GigaOm. "[http://gigaom.com/2011/07/25/apply-with-linkedin-button-launches/ LinkedIn launches job application plugin]." July 25, 2011.

LinkedIn's Profinder is a marketplace where freelancers can (for a monthly subscription fee) bid for project proposals submitted by individuals and small businesses .<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/columnist/stevenpetrow/2017/05/10/3-game-changing-linkedin-features/101032400/|title=3 overlooked LinkedIn features to find a better paying job|last=Petrow|first=Steven|date=2017-05-10|website=USA TODAY|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-18}}</ref> In 2017, it had around 60,000 freelancers in more than 140 service areas, such as headshot photography, bookkeeping or tax filing.<ref name=":2" />

The premise for connecting with someone has shifted significantly in recent years. Prior to the 2017 new interface being launched, LinkedIn encouraged connections between people who'd already worked together, studied together, done business together or the like. Since 2017 that step has been removed from the connection request process - and users are allowed to connect with up to 30,000 people. This change means LinkedIn is a more proactive networking site, be that for job applicants trying to secure a career move or for salespeople wanting to generate new client leads.<ref name="twsLong1212" />

=== Top Companies ===
[[LinkedIn Top Companies]] is a series of lists published by LinkedIn, identifying companies in the United States, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Japan, Mexico and the United Kingdom that are attracting the most intense interest from job candidates. The 2019 lists identified [[Google]]'s parent company, [[Alphabet Inc.|Alphabet]], as the most sought-after U.S. company, with [[Facebook]] ranked second and [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]] ranked third.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/linkedin-top-companies-2019-where-us-wants-work-now-daniel-roth/ |website=LinkedIn |title=LinkedIn Top Companies 2019: Where the U.S. wants to work now |date=April 3, 2019 |first=Daniel |last=Roth |author-link=Daniel Roth (writer)}}</ref> The lists are based on more than one billion actions by LinkedIn members worldwide.

== Reception ==
LinkedIn has been described by online [[trade publication]] ''[[TechRepublic]]'' as having "become the de facto tool for professional networking".<ref>"Five Benefits of LinkedIn for Organizations (and IT Pros) | TechRepublic." Web. May 9, 2011.</ref> LinkedIn has also been praised for its usefulness in fostering business relationships.<ref>"LinkedIn.com, a business-orientated networking site, can be an ideal way for professionals to present an online profile of themselves ... Unlike social networking sites, [with] LinkedIn you're outlining all your credentials; presenting the professional rather than the personal you. Considering the sheer vastness of the digital space, the potential for building up a solid base of contacts and fostering new business relationships is boundless." O'Sullivan, James (2011), "Make the most of the networking tools that are available", ''[[Evening Echo]]'', May 9, 2011. Pg 32. Note that the ''Evening Echo'' is located close to the European headquarters of LinkedIn</ref> "LinkedIn is, far and away, the most advantageous social networking tool available to job seekers and business professionals today," according to ''[[Forbes]]''.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/dailymuse/2012/07/06/your-linkedin-intervention-5-changes-you-must-make/ |work=Forbes |date=July 6, 2012 |title=Your LinkedIn Intervention: 5 Changes You Must Make |last=Foss |first=Jenny}}</ref> LinkedIn has inspired the creation of specialised professional networking opportunities, such as co-founder Eddie Lou's Chicago startup, [[Shiftgig]] (released in 2012 as a platform for hourly workers).<ref>{{Cite news|last=MacArthur|first=Kate|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/bluesky/originals/ct-bsi-shiftgig-new-ceo-20170918-story.html|title=Shiftgig hires LinkedIn vice president as new CEO|work=chicagotribune.com|access-date=2017-09-20|language=en-US}}</ref>

===Research on labor market effects===

In 2010, ''[[Social Science Computer Review]]'' published research by economists Ralf Caers and Vanessa Castelyns who sent an online questionnaire to 398 and 353 LinkedIn and [[Facebook]] users respectively in [[Belgium]] and found that both sites had become tools for [[Recruitment|recruiting]] job applicants for professional occupations as well as additional information about applicants, and that it was being used by recruiters to decide which applicants would receive interviews.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Caers|first1=Ralf|last2=Castelyns|first2=Vanessa|title=LinkedIn and Facebook in Belgium: The Influences and Biases of Social Network Sites in Recruitment and Selection Procedures|year=2011|journal=[[Social Science Computer Review]]|publisher=[[SAGE Publishing|SAGE Publications]]|volume=29|issue=4|pages=437–448|doi=10.1177/0894439310386567|s2cid=60557417|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258190136}}</ref> In May 2017, ''Research Policy'' published an analysis of PhD holders use of LinkedIn and found that PhD holders who move into industry were more likely to have LinkedIn accounts and to have larger networks of LinkedIn connections, were more likely to use LinkedIn if they had co-authors abroad, and to have wider networks if they moved abroad after obtaining their PhD.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Baruffaldi|first1=Stefano H.|last2=Di Maio|first2=Giorgio|last3=Landoni|first3=Paolo|title=Determinants of PhD holders' use of social networking sites: An analysis based on LinkedIn|year=2017|journal=Research Policy|publisher=[[Elsevier]]|volume=46|issue=4|pages=740–750|doi=10.1016/j.respol.2017.01.014|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0048733317300239|access-date=September 11, 2020}}</ref>

Also in 2017, sociologist Ofer Sharone conducted interviews with unemployed workers to research the effects of LinkedIn and Facebook as labor market intermediaries and found that [[social networking service]]s (SNS) have had a filtration effect that has little to do with evaluations of merit, and that the SNS filtration effect has exerted new pressures on workers to manage their careers to conform to the logic of the SNS filtration effect.<ref>{{cite book|last=Sharone|first=Ofer|editor-first=Steven|editor-last=Vallas|title=Emerging Conceptions of Work, Management and the Labor Market|chapter=LinkedIn or LinkedOut?

Rhee, Hwang, and Tan further found that referring employees in higher hierarchical positions than the job candidates were more likely to provide referrals and that gender [[homophily]] did not reduce the competition self-protection effect.<ref>{{cite document|last1=Rhee|first1=Melissa|last2=Hwang|first2=Elina|last3=Tan|first3=Yong|title=Social Hiring: The Right LinkedIn Connection that Helps You Land a Job|year=2018|ssrn=3261180|doi=10.2139/ssrn.3261180|s2cid=54436461|url=https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3261180|access-date=September 14, 2020}}</ref>

In July 2019, sociologists Steve McDonald, Amanda K. Damarin, Jenelle Lawhorne, and Annika Wilcox performed qualitative interviews with 61 [[Human resources|HR]] recruiters in two [[metropolitan area]]s in the [[Southern United States]] and found that recruiters filling low- and general-skilled positions typically posted advertisements on [[Employment website|online job boards]] while recruiters filling high-skilled or [[supervisor]] positions targeted passive candidates on LinkedIn (i.e. employed workers not actively seeking work but possibly willing to change positions), and concluded that this is resulting in a bifurcated [[winner-take-all market|winner-takes-all]] job market with recruiters focusing their efforts on poaching already employed high-skilled workers while active job seekers are relegated to hyper-competitive online job boards.<ref>{{cite book|last1=McDonald|first1=Steve|last2=Damarin|first2=Amanda K.|last3=Lawhorne|first3=Jenelle|last4=Wilcox|first4=Annika|editor-last1=Vallas|editor-first1=Steven|editor-last2=Kovalainen|editor-first2=Anne|title=Work and Labor in the Digital Age|series=Research in the Sociology of Work|chapter=Black Holes and Purple Squirrels: A Tale of Two Online Labor Markets|year=2019|place=[[Bingley]], [[United Kingdom|UK]]|publisher=[[Emerald Group Publishing|Emerald Publishing Ltd]]|volume=33|pages=93–120|isbn=978-1789735864|doi=10.1108/S0277-283320190000033006|url=https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/S0277-283320190000033006/full/html}}</ref>

In a September 2019 [[working paper]], economists Laurel Wheeler, Robert Garlick, and [[RTI International]] scholars Eric Johnson, Patrick Shaw, and Marissa Gargano ran a randomized evaluation of training job seekers in [[South Africa]] to use LinkedIn as part of job readiness programs. The evaluation found that the training increased the job seekers employment by approximately 10 percent by reducing [[Frictional unemployment|information frictions]] between job seekers and prospective employers, that the training had this effect for approximately 12 months, and that while the training may also have facilitated referrals, it did not reduce [[Job hunting|job search costs]] and the jobs for the [[treatment and control groups]] in the evaluation had equal probabilities of retention, promotion, and obtaining a permanent contract.<ref>{{citation|last1=Wheeler|first1=Laurel|last2=Garlick|first2=Robert|last3=Johnson|first3=Eric|last4=Shaw|first4=Patrick|last5=Gargano|first5=Marissa|contribution=LinkedIn(to) Job Opportunities: Experimental Evidence from Job Readiness Training|year=2019|title=Economic Research Initiatives at Duke|publisher=[[Duke University]]|ssrn=3452609|doi=10.2139/ssrn.3452249|s2cid=203525431|url=https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3452249|access-date=September 14, 2020}}</ref> In 2020, ''[[Applied Economics (journal)|Applied Economics]]'' published research by economists Steffen Brenner, Sezen Aksin Sivrikaya, and Joachim Schwalbach using LinkedIn demonstrating that high status individuals [[Self-selection|self-select]] into professional networking services rather than workers unsatisfied with their career status adversely selecting into the services to receive networking benefits.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Brenner|first1=Steffen|last2=Sivrikaya|first2=Sezen Aksin|last3=Schwalbach|first3=Joachim|title=Who is on LinkedIn?

== Criticism and controversies ==
LinkedIn has received criticism, primarily regarding e-mail address mining and auto-update.
Changing the description below a member's name is seen as a change in a job title, even if it is just a wording change or even a change to "unemployed". Unless a member opts to "turn off activity updates", an update is sent to all of that person's contacts, telling them to congratulate the member on the "new job".<ref>{{cite magazine |title=How LinkedIn can thwart your job search |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/nextavenue/2014/01/21/how-linkedin-is-thwarting-your-job-search/ |magazine=Forbes |accessdate=29 April 2014}}</ref>

The feature that allows LinkedIn members to "endorse" each other's skills and experience has been criticized as meaningless, since the endorsements are not necessarily accurate or given by people who have familiarity with the member's skills.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=All you need to know about endorsements |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/susanadams/2013/12/24/everything-you-need-to-know-about-linkedin-endorsements-2/ |magazine=Forbes |accessdate=29 April 2014}}</ref> In October 2016, LinkedIn acknowledged that it "really does matter who endorsed you" and began highlighting endorsements from "coworkers and other mutual connections" to address the criticism.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/linkedin-upgrades-skill-endorsements-2016-10 |title=LinkedIn is making its endorsements feature a lot smarter to help people find jobs |work=Business Insider |access-date=2017-03-26 |language=en}}</ref>

=== Use of e-mail accounts of members for spam sending ===
LinkedIn sends "invite emails" to Outlook contacts from its members' email accounts, without obtaining their consent. The "invitations" give the impression that the e-mail holder themself has sent the invitation. If there is no response, the answer will be repeated several times ("You have not yet answered XY's invitation.") LinkedIn was sued in the United States on charges of hijacking e-mail accounts and spamming. The company argued with the right to freedom of expression. In addition, the users concerned would be supported in building a network.<ref>[http://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/234555/linkedin-argues-it-has-free-speech-right-to-email.html LinkedIn argues it has free speech right to email] Mediapost.com in 19 September 2014.</ref><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20141016201936/http://www.courthousenews.com/2014/10/13/72394.htm LinkedIn 'Credit Reports' Give Job Seekers Trouble] Courthouse News Service in 13 October 2014.</ref><ref>[http://mic.com/articles/101236/linked-in-illegally-sold-your-professional-data-lawsuit-claims LinkedIn illegally sold your professional data lawsuit claims] News Mic in 13 October 2014.</ref>

The sign-up process includes a step for users to enter their email password (there is an opt-out feature). LinkedIn will then offer to send out contact invitations to all members in that address book or that the user has had email conversations with. When the member's email address book is opened it is opened with all email addresses selected and the member is advised invitations will be sent to "selected" email addresses, or to all. LinkedIn was sued for sending out another two follow-up invitations to each contact from members to link to friends who had ignored the initial, authorized, invitation.

In November 2014, LinkedIn lost a motion to dismiss the lawsuit, in a ruling that the invitations were advertisements not broadly protected by free speech rights that would otherwise permit use of people's names and images without authorization.<ref>[http://betanews.com/2014/06/15/linkedin-to-face-lawsuit-for-spamming-users-email-address-books/ LinkedIn to face lawsuit for spamming users' email address books], BetaNews</ref><ref>[http://gigaom.com/2013/09/21/linkedin-is-breaking-into-user-emails-spamming-contacts-lawsuit/ LinkedIn is "breaking into" user emails, spamming contacts – lawsuit], Gigaom.com</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/238275/judge-rejects-linkedins-free-speech-argument-in-b.html?|title=Judge Rejects LinkedIn's Free-Speech Argument In Battle Over Email Invitations|website=Mediapost.com|accessdate=July 3, 2015}}</ref> The lawsuit was eventually settled in 2015 in favor of LinkedIn members.<ref name="auto" />

=== Security and technology ===
{{Main|2012 LinkedIn hack}}
In June 2012, [[Cryptographic hash function|cryptographic hashes]] of approximately 6.4 million LinkedIn user [[password]]s were [[Computer crime|stolen]] by [[Yevgeniy Nikulin]] and other [[Hacker (computer security)|hackers]] who then published the stolen hashes online.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/257045/update_linkedin_confirms_account_passwords_hacked.html|title=LinkedIn Confirms Account Passwords Hacked|date=June 6, 2012|publisher=PC World.com|accessdate=June 6, 2012}}</ref> This action is known as the [[2012 LinkedIn hack]]. In response to the incident, LinkedIn asked its users to change their passwords. [[White hat (computer security)|Security experts]] criticized LinkedIn for not [[Salt (cryptography)|salting]] their password file and for using a single iteration of [[SHA-1]].<ref>{{cite news|author=Finkle, Jim and Jennifer Saba|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/06/06/linkedin-breach-idINL1E8H6CBC20120606|title=LinkedIn suffers data breach|date=June 6, 2012|work=Reuters|accessdate=June 7, 2012}}</ref> On May 31, 2013 LinkedIn added [[two-factor authentication]], an important [[Computer security|security]] enhancement for preventing hackers from gaining access to accounts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lifehacker.com/linkedin-just-added-two-factor-authentication-so-enabl-510680312|title=LinkedIn Just Added Two-Factor Authentication, So Enable It Now|date=2013-05-31|publisher=Lifehacker.com|accessdate=2015-10-06}}</ref> In May 2016, 117 million LinkedIn usernames and passwords were offered for sale online for the equivalent of $2,200.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mashable.com/2016/05/18/linkedin-hack//|title=LinkedIn resetting passwords after 117 million user credentials stolen|publisher=MashableUK|accessdate=2016-05-19}}</ref> These account details are believed to be sourced from the original 2012 LinkedIn hack, in which the number of user IDs stolen had been underestimated. To handle the large volume of emails sent to its users every day with notifications for messages, profile views, important happenings in their network, and other things, LinkedIn uses the Momentum email platform from Message Systems.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=The biggest email provider you've never heard of|url=http://fortune.com/2014/10/06/message-systems-email-provider/|magazine=Fortune.com|accessdate=2015-10-06}}</ref>

In 2014, Dell SecureWorks Counter Threat Unit (CTU) discovered that Threat Group-2889, an [[Iran]]-based group, created 25 fake LinkedIn accounts.

According to reporting by ''[[Le Figaro]]'', France's [[General Directorate for Internal Security]] and [[Directorate-General for External Security]] believe that Chinese spies have used LinkedIn to target thousands of business and government officials as potential sources of information.<ref>{{cite news|last=Samuel|first=Henry|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/10/23/chinese-online-spies-fool-hundreds-totally-unprepared-top-french/|title=Chinese spies fooled 'hundreds' of civil servants and executives, France reveals|date=October 23, 2018|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph|3=The Telegraph]]|access-date=26 October 2018|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181026222445/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/10/23/chinese-online-spies-fool-hundreds-totally-unprepared-top-french/|archive-date=26 October 2018|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

In 2017, Germany's [[Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution]] (BfV) published information alleging that [[China|Chinese]] intelligence services had created fake [[social media]] profiles on sites such as LinkedIn, using them to gather information on German politicians and government officials.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-germany-security-china/german-intelligence-unmasks-alleged-covert-chinese-social-media-profiles-idUSKBN1E40CA|title=German intelligence unmasks alleged covert Chinese social media profiles|date=December 10, 2017|work=[[Reuters]]|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171210151926/https://www.reuters.com/article/us-germany-security-china/german-intelligence-unmasks-alleged-covert-chinese-social-media-profiles-idUSKBN1E40CA|archive-date=10 December 2017|editor-last=Bigg|editor-first=Matthew Mpoke|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Grieshaber|first=Kirsten|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/germanys-intelligence-head-warns-of-increased-cyberspying-from-china/article37282135/|title=Germany's intelligence head warns of increased cyberspying from China|date=December 10, 2017|newspaper=[[The Globe and Mail]]|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171211040953/https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/germanys-intelligence-head-warns-of-increased-cyberspying-from-china/article37282135/|archive-date=11 December 2017|quote=Hans-Georg Maassen said his agency, known by its German acronym BfV, believes more than 10,000 Germans have been targeted by Chinese intelligence agents posing as consultants, headhunters or researchers, primarily on the social networking site LinkedIn.|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

=== Moving emails to LinkedIn servers ===
At the end of 2013, it was announced that the LinkedIn app intercepted users' emails and silently moved them to LinkedIn servers for full access.<ref name="New York Times">[http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/10/24/linkedins-new-mobile-app-called-a-dream-for-attackers/ LinkedIns new mobile app called a dream for attackers] New York Times in 24 October 2013.</ref> LinkedIn used man-in-the-middle attacks.<ref>[http://www.pcwelt.de/news/LinkedIn_liest_Ihre_E-Mails_mit-Intro-8281685.html LinkedIn liest Ihre Mails mit] [[PC-Welt]] in 28 October 2013.</ref>

=== Privacy policy ===
The German [[Stiftung Warentest]] has criticized that the balance of rights between users and LinkedIn is disproportionate, restricting users' rights excessively while granting the company far-reaching rights.<ref>[http://www.golem.de/1003/74091.html Stiftung Warentest kritisiert Facebook, LinkedIn und Myspace] ''golem.de'' (German) in 3 March 2018.</ref> It has also been claimed that LinkedIn does not respond to consumer protection center requests.<ref>[https://www.test.de/Soziale-Netzwerke-Datenschutz-oft-mangelhaft-1854798-0/?mc=kurzurl.netzwerke Soziale Netzwerke: Datenschutz oft mangelhaft] ''Stiftung Warentest'' (German) in 24 March 2014.</ref>

=== Potential 2018 breach, or extended impacts from earlier incidents ===
In July 2018, Credit Wise reported "dark web" email and password exposures from LinkedIn. Shortly thereafter, users began receiving extortion emails, using that information as "evidence" that users' contacts had been hacked, and threatening to expose pornographic videos featuring the users. LinkedIn asserts that this is related to the 2012 breach; however, there is no evidence that this is the case.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://it.trustpilot.com/review/www.linkedin.com?languages=all|title=User's recensions on Linkedin|website=[[Trustpilot]].com}}</ref>

== International restrictions ==
In 2009, [[Internet censorship in Syria|Syrian]] users reported that LinkedIn server stopped accepting connections originating from [[IP address]]es assigned to Syria. The company's customer support stated that services provided by them are subject to US export and re-export control laws and regulations and "As such, and as a matter of corporate policy, we do not allow member accounts or access to our site from Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Sudan, or Syria."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://advocacy.globalvoicesonline.org/2009/04/18/syria-linkedin-kicks-off-syrian-users/ |title=Syria: Linkedin Kicks Off Syrian Users! |publisher=Global Voices Advocacy |date=April 18, 2009 |accessdate=April 30, 2010}}</ref>

In February 2011, it was reported that LinkedIn was being [[Internet censorship in the People's Republic of China|blocked in China]] after calls for a "[[2011 Chinese pro-democracy protests|Jasmine Revolution]]". It was speculated to have been blocked because it is an easy way for dissidents to access [[Twitter]], which had been [[Censorship of Twitter|blocked]] previously.<ref>{{cite news |last=Ungerleider |first=Neal |title=China blocks access to LinkedIn |url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/TECH/social.media/02/25/china.blocks.linkedin.fastco/index.html?iref=NS1 |accessdate=February 25, 2011 |newspaper=Fast Company |date=February 25, 2011}}</ref> After a day of being blocked, LinkedIn access was restored in China.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/02/25/us-linkedin-idUSTRE71O5VY20110225 |last=Baker |first=Liana |title=LinkedIn website working again in China |date=February 25, 2011 |newspaper=Reuters}}</ref>

On 4 August 2016, a Moscow court ruled that LinkedIn must be blocked in Russia for violating a new [[data retention]] law, which requires the user data of Russian citizens to be stored on servers within the country. This ban was upheld on 10 November 2016, and all Russian ISPs began blocking LinkedIn thereafter. LinkedIn's mobile app was also banned from [[Google Play Store]] and [[iOS App Store]] in Russia in January 2017.<ref name="verge-linkedinapprus">{{cite web |title=Russia is erasing Linkedin from app stores |url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/1/6/14197030/russia-linkedin-blocked-app-store-ios-android |website=The Verge |publisher=Vox Media |accessdate=7 January 2017|date=January 7, 2017 }}</ref><ref name="moscowtimes-upheld">{{cite web |title=Moscow Court Upholds Decision to Ban LinkedIn in Russia |url=https://themoscowtimes.com/news/moscow-court-upholds-decision-to-ban-linkedin-in-russia-56086 |website=The Moscow Times |accessdate=10 November 2016|date=November 10, 2016 }}</ref>
