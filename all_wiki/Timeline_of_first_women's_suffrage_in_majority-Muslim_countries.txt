In most [[North Africa]] countries, women participated in the first national elections or soon following.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Caraway|first=Teri L.|date=2004|title=Inclusion and Democratization: Class, Gender, Race, and the Extension of Suffrage|jstor=4150170|journal=Comparative Politics|volume=36|issue=4|pages=443â€“460|doi=10.2307/4150170}}</ref> Some dates relate to regional elections and, where possible, the second date of general election has been included.
