'''Panfilo "Ping" Morena Lacson Sr.''' (born June 1, 1948) is a Filipino senator who served from 2001–2013 and again from 2016–present. He is a retired [[police officer]] who headed the [[Philippine National Police]] from 1999 to 2001.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Panfilo Lacson Resume on Senate Website|url=https://www.senate.gov.ph/senators/sen_bio/lacson_resume18th.asp|access-date=April 6, 2020|website=Senate of the Republic of the Philippines}}</ref>

As senator, Lacson earned a reputation as a "watchdog" of the national budget, calling out and pushing for the removal of dubious congressional insertions and appropriations locally referred to as pork barrel.

In December 2013, Lacson was appointed by then [[Philippines]] President [[Benigno Aquino III]] as Presidential Assistant for Rehabilitation and Recovery, to lead the management and rehabilitation efforts of the central provinces in the Philippines affected by [[Typhoon Haiyan]].<ref>[blogs.wsj.com/searealtime/2013/12/02/philippines-aquino-appoints-past-senator-to-helm-typhoon-rehab/   Wall Streel Journal, Philippines’ Aquino Appoints Past Senator to Helm Typhoon Rehab]</ref> Eight months into his job, Lacson secured the approval from Aquino of the phased implementation of the rehabilitation plan of six areas in the Super-Typhoon Yolanda destruction corridor, especially in the [[Eastern Visayas]] and [[Central Visayas]] [[Regions of the Philippines|regions]].

==Early Life and Academic Background==
Panfilo Morena Lacson was born in [[Imus]], [[Cavite]] on June 1, 1948.<ref name="senbio">{{cite web |url=http://www.senate.gov.ph/senators/sen_bio/lacson_bio.asp |title=Senator Panfilo M. Lacson  |publisher=[[Senate of the Philippines]] |access-date=May 23, 2010}}</ref> His late mother, Maxima,  was a disciplinarian who instilled distinctions between right and wrong with her children. This grew to be part of his motto, "What is right must be kept right; what is wrong must be set right."<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://politics.com.ph/this-woman-made-ping-cry/|title=Tough crime czar Ping Lacson weeps every time he remembers his mother. Here's why - Politiko|date=March 27, 2016|work=Politiko|access-date=July 10, 2017|language=en-US}}</ref>

He finished grade school at the Bayang Luma Elementary School in 1960 and high school at the [[Imus Institute]] in 1964. He completed his [[Philosophy|Bachelor of Arts in Philosophy]] degree at the [[Lyceum of the Philippines University]] before entering the [[Philippine Military Academy]] (PMA) in 1967.<ref name="senbio" /> Former senator and now [[Department of Information and Communications Technology|DICT]] Secretary [[Gregorio Honasan]] was his classmate.<ref>Cantos, J.

After his graduation in 1971, Lacson was commissioned in the [[Philippine Constabulary]] (PC), then a major service of the [[Armed Forces of the Philippines]] (AFP) responsible for maintaining peace and order and enforcement of laws in the country.<ref name="senbio" />

In 1996 he earned a postgraduate degree of Master in [[Public Administration|Government Management]] from the [[Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Maynila]].<ref name="senbio" />

==Police career==
Lacson worked at the PC Metropolitan Command (Metrocom), Intelligence and Security Group (MISG), from 1971 to 1986. The MISG was commanded by the late Colonel Rolando Abadilla. Lacson rose through the ranks, becoming lieutenant colonel in the mid-1980s. After the 1986 [[People Power Revolution]], he served at the PC-INP Anti-Carnapping Task Force as its commander from 1986 to 1988, as provincial commander of the Province of [[Isabela (province)|Isabela]] from 1988 to 1989, and as commander of the [[Metro Cebu|Cebu]] Metropolitan District Command (Metrodiscom) from 1989 to 1992. In 1991, he joined the then-newly created civilian [[Philippine National Police]], or PNP, formed as a result of the merger of the military Philippine Constabulary and the civilian [[Integrated National Police]] or INP. (The INP was formed in 1975 as an integration of all local police forces in the country then under operational control of the PC.) Soon Lacson became Provincial Director of the Province of [[Laguna province|Laguna]] from February to July 1992. Afterwards, he was appointed Chief of Task Force Habagat at the Presidential Anti-Crime Commission from 1992 to 1995. From 1996 to April 1997, he was given the task of project officer of "Special Project Alpha." Lacson was appointed Chief of the PNP on November 18, 1999.

=== Anti-Kidnap Achievements and No-Take Policy ===
While serving in the Philippine Constabulary's Metropolitan Command, Lacson solving crimes, including kidnap-for-ransom incidents. In 1981, Lacson was a Lieutenant Colonel with the PC-Metrocom, when he led a team that rescued now-tycoon Robina Gokongwei-Pe, daughter of businessman [[John Gokongwei|John Gokongwei Jr]]., from a kidnap-for-ransom gang.

Robina's family offered Lacson and his team a reward, but Lacson declined it, as part of his no-take policy. Lacson explained he does not want his men to have the mentality of not helping “gusgusin” (poor) complainants who may not afford to give them a reward. The Gokongweis eventually decided to show their gratitude by donating mobile patrol vehicles to the PC, coursing it through then PC chief Maj. Gen. [[Fidel Ramos]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pinglacson.net/2019/08/19/lacson-time-to-revisit-make-anti-graft-laws-more-implementable/|title=Lacson: Time to Revisit, Make Anti-Graft Laws More Implementable|date=2019-08-19|website=PANFILO 'PING' LACSON|language=en-US|access-date=2019-08-22}}</ref>

In a Twitter post, Lacson recalled advising the elder Gokongwei not to sound intimidated while negotiating with the kidnappers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/iampinglacson/status/1193321028245549056|title=In 1981, I instructed him not to sound intimidated while negotiating for Robina's ransom snapped at her kidnappers, "10M?

Lacson, who would later head the Philippine National Police from 1999 to 2001, founded the PNP Foundation in 2000, as a way for civic-minded people to give contributions for the benefit of the PNP as an institution.

During his stint in Cebu, Lacson rescued the scion of a Cebu-based retail magnate. The victim's family intended to give the money they prepared as ransom to Lacson and his operatives as a reward, but Lacson declined it. Lacson was said to have told the victim's family that a mere "thank you" was more than enough for him.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://mindanaotimes.com.ph/2019/08/19/rough-cuts-zozobrados-proposed-ordinance/|title=Rough Cuts {{!}} Zozobrado's proposed ordinance|date=2019-08-19|website=Mindanao Times|language=en-US|access-date=2019-08-22}}</ref>

In 1992, Lacson was recruited to the Presidential Anti-Crime Commission chaired by then Vice President [[Joseph Estrada]]. Lacson headed the PACC's Task Force Habagat, which would go on to solve several kidnap-for-ransom cases.

=== Anti-Jueteng Campaign ===
Aside from kidnap-for-ransom gangs, jueteng and other forms of illegal gambling were also in Lacson's sights when he was in the PC, and eventually in the Philippine National Police.

In 1992, he bared an attempt by local jueteng operators in Laguna to bribe him, initially to the tune of P1.2 million a month. He rejected the offer.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pinglacson.net/2017/05/24/sponsorship-speech-for-committee-report-77-for-senate-bill-909-an-act-increasing-the-penalties-for-other-illegal-gambling-activities/|title=Sponsorship Speech for Committee Report 77|date=2017-05-24|website=PANFILO 'PING' LACSON|language=en-US|access-date=2019-08-22}}</ref>

Lacson maintained an all-out effort against jueteng, even if in the process he crossed paths with eventual President [[Joseph Estrada]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pinglacson.net/2009/09/14/ang-dalawang-mukha-ng-sining/|title=Ang Dalawang Mukha ng Sining|date=2009-09-14|website=PANFILO 'PING' LACSON|language=en-US|access-date=2019-08-22}}</ref>

=== Chief, PNP (1999-2001) ===
As Chief PNP, Lacson eliminated the “Kotong culture” among the police officers. He rationalized the distribution of financial and logistical resources by downloading 85 percent to the police frontline units, retaining only 15 percent in the police headquarters. He imposed a strict physical fitness test on all PNP members, invoking a 34-inch maximum waistline for police officers.

Lacson refused to accept bribe money from illegal gambling operators and contractors and suppliers transacting business with the PNP, declining offers of monetary rewards from kidnap-for-ransom victims after rescuing them from their captors.<ref name="senate.gov.ph">{{Cite web|url=http://senate.gov.ph/senators/sen_bio/lacson_resume.asp|title=Legislative Agenda of Senator Lacson - Senate of the Philippines|website=senate.gov.ph|access-date=July 10, 2017}}</ref>

Under Lacson's leadership, the PNP achieved a 58% public approval rating, while Lacson got a 78% approval rating for himself.<ref name="senate.gov.ph"/>

=== Kuratong Baleleng Case ===
The Kuratong Baleleng of the 1990s was a criminal gang linked to a series of violent crimes that included kidnappings and bank robberies. In some of the robberies, the gang's members would gun down security guards and innocent bystanders.

In 1995, members of a composite task group assigned to stop robberies in Metro Manila were linked to the killing of 11 members of [[Kuratong Baleleng]] in Quezon City. The PACC was a part of the composite task force.

In 2003, the High Tribunal ordered the Quezon City Regional Trial Court to try the case against Lacson and 33 other police officials. The trial court dismissed the criminal case, finding absence of probable cause. The special prosecuting team later moved for new trial before the High Tribunal to remand case to the trial court to present new evidence against Senator Lacson, inter alia. On May 2, 2008, the [[Supreme Court of the Philippines]] resolved to take cognizance of the motion of the families of the slain Kuratong Baleleng members for revival of the murder case against police officials and Senator Panfilo Lacson.<ref>[http://www.gmanews.tv/story/93051/SC-defers-action-on-revival-of-Kuratong-case gmanews.tv/story, SC defers action on revival of Kuratong case]</ref>

On November 13, 2012, the Supreme Court in an en banc decision denied the government's motion to revive the case and affirmed the lower court's decision dismissing it.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://elibrary.judiciary.gov.ph/thebookshelf/showdocs/1/55328|title=G.R.

===Dacer–Corbito Murder Case===
On November 24, 2000, [[publicist]] [[Bubby Dacer|Salvador “Bubby” Dacer]] and his driver Emmanuel Corbito were abducted in [[Makati City]]. In April 2001, their burnt corpses were found by a creek in [[Indang]], [[Cavite]]. The [[Department of Justice (Philippines)|Department of Justice]] filed double murder charges against [[Philippine National Police|Police]] Senior Superintendent [[Michael Ray Aquino]] and other police officers, including Senior Superintendent Cezar Mancao II and Senior Superintendent Glenn Dumlao – all members of Presidential Anti-Organized Crime Task Force (PAOCTF) headed by then [[Philippine National Police|Police]] Director-General Panfilo Lacson.<ref>''GMA News Online''.

In his 2001 affidavit, Senior Superintendent Glenn Dumlao implicated then President [[Joseph Estrada]] and then Director-General Panfilo Lacson in the Dacer–Corbito Murder Case. Both Estrada and Lacson denied their involvement.<ref name="PDI_Dacer-Corbito" />

In 2009, former police senior superintendent Cezar Mancao II named Lacson as the mastermind of the murders of Salvador Dacer and Emmanuel Corbito. The allegations were made in an affidavit that Mancao signed on February 14, 2009. Mancao was allegedly present when Lacson gave the hit order to then Police Senior Superintendent Michael Ray Aquino sometime in October 2000.<ref name="PhilStarMancao">[https://archive.is/20120911105640/http://www.philstar.com/Article.aspx?articleId=449023 Ping gave hit order on Dacer - Mancao].

Lacson denied these allegations, stating that the [[Gloria Macapagal Arroyo|Office of the President]] had pressured Mancao to sign the affidavit.<ref name="PhilStarMancao" />

On January 5, 2010, Lacson left the Philippines on a [[Cathay Pacific]] flight to [[Hong Kong]], shortly before charges against him were filed in court.<ref>Dedace, Sophia (February 2, 2010).

Lacson was appointed by then President [[Joseph Estrada]] to head the Presidential Anti-Organized Crime Task Force (PAOCTF) and to serve as [[Philippine National Police Chief]].

=== First 2 Senate terms (2001-2013, 2016-present) ===
[[File:Lacson at PNP Crime Lab Anniv.jpg|alt=|thumb|Lacson at Camp Crame in 2019]]
Lacson ran for senator in the [[2001 Philippine general election|2001 elections]] under the [[Laban ng Demokratikong Pilipino]] (LDP), which was affiliated with Estrada's ''[[Puwersa ng Masa]]'' coalition. He won a seat in the Senate, finishing in tenth place.

In late 2006, Lacson said he might run as mayor of the city of [[Manila]] in the [[2007 Philippine general election|2007 midterm elections]]. However, he rescinded that decision and instead ran for a second Senate term under the [[Genuine Opposition]] coalition. He won reelection in the [[2007 Philippine Senate election|2007 senatorial elections]] senatorial elections, ranking third.

On March 11, 2003, Lacson delivered a speech entitled Living Without Pork, exposing the evils and temptations presented by the pork barrel system, and called for its total abolition.<ref name=":0">{{Citation|last=Ping Lacson|title=Privilege Speech: Living Without Pork {{!}} March 11, 2003|date=2017-07-16|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzzDrx6Wxxo&t=2s|access-date=2019-07-04}}</ref> During deliberations on the national budget, he stated he would make sure his PDAF allocation reverted to the National Treasury – in the process saving the government some PhP2.4 billion during his first 12 years in the Senate.

Lacson's advocacy against the pork barrel system and the corruption associated with him was cited by the [[Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Maynila]] when it conferred on him the degree of Doctor of Laws, Honoris Causa, on March 27, 2019.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=https://pinglacson.net/2019/03/28/doctorate-degree-and-speech-at-the-commencement-exercises-of-the-pamantasan-ng-lungsod-ng-maynila/|title=Doctorate Degree and Speech at the Commencement Exercises of the Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Maynila|date=2019-03-28|website=Panfilo "Ping" Lacson|language=en-US|access-date=2019-03-29}}</ref>

Lacson filed bills that aimed to improve public service, enhance reproductive health, promote investments, bolster the country's defense capabilities,

He was one of the main authors of two legislative measures of the Aquino administration, one of which was the Reproductive Health Act. The measure seeks to promote responsible parenthood and to protect the health of the mother and child by giving them access to reproductive health services. President Benigno Aquino III certified the bill as urgent, allowing Congress to pass it quickly. President Aquino signed it into law as Republic Act 10354 in December 2012.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2012/12/29/891258/copy-rh-law-signed-president-benigno-s.-aquino-iii|title=Copy of RH Law signed by President Benigno S.

Another legislative measure where Lacson was a main author was the Sin Tax Reform Act, which imposes higher taxes on tobacco and alcohol products to deter the public from buying such products. Those who buy such products will have to pay higher taxes, whose proceeds will go to the government's universal health program.

For the Sin Tax Reform Act, Lacson had filed Senate Bill No. 2763, which sought to restructure the excise tax on alcohol products; and Senate Bill No. 2764, which sought to restructure the excise tax on tobacco products. President Aquino signed the bill into law as Republic Act 10351.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2012/12/21/888415/sin-tax-bill-signed-law|title=Sin tax bill signed into law|last=Calica|first=Aurea|work=The Philippine Star|access-date=July 10, 2017}}</ref>

Lacson authored Senate Bill No. 2783, which strengthened further the Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2001.

Lacson filed Senate Bill No. 2945, which reapportioned the province of Cotabato into three legislative districts. The bill was passed into law as Republic Act 10177.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/2012/09/14/republic-act-no-10177/|title=Republic Act No. 10177|website=Official Gazette of the Republic of the Philippines|access-date=July 10, 2017}}</ref>

He filed resolutions that led to many officials being held accountable, whether incumbent or former. Among these were:

* Resolution No. 518: Directing the Blue Ribbon Committee to look into the alleged anomalous acquisition by the Philippine National Police of light operational helicopters in 2009. The resolution triggered an investigation that led to the filing of criminal charges against the officials and personalities linked to the questionable purchase. Some of them were dismissed from the service.
* Resolution No. 519: Directing the Senate Blue Ribbon Committee to look into corruption by the previous board of the Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office. Many of the officials linked to the irregularity – including former president Gloria Arroyo – have been charged before the graft court.
* Resolution No. 537: Directing the Blue Ribbon Committee to investigate electoral sabotage in the 2004 and 2007 elections, which triggered the charges that led to the arrest and detention of former officials, including former president Gloria Arroyo.

Another resolution, Resolution No. 660, seeks to congratulate new Cardinal and Manila Archbishop Luis Antonio Cardinal Tagle.

Lacson  filed resolutions commending members of the police and military for safeguarding Filipinos, including:

* Resolution No. 542: Resolution honoring The Outstanding Philippine Soldiers (TOPS) of 2011
* Resolution No. 562: Resolution commending the Country's Outstanding Policemen in Service (COPS) of 2011

===Presidential Bid, 2004===
{{Main|2004 Philippine presidential election}}
Lacson ran for [[President of the Philippines|President]] in the 2004 [[2004 Philippine general election|general election]] against the incumbent president, [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]]. His candidacy stirred disagreements with its party president, Senator [[Edgardo Angara]].<ref>Aravilla, Jose & Diaz, Jess (December 30, 2003). [http://www.philstar.com/headlines/233366/lacson-formalizes-2004-bid Lacson formalizes 2004 bid.] ''The Philippine Star''.</ref> The [[Commission on Elections (Philippines)|COMELEC]] decided to follow what was done in the [[1949 Philippine general election|Quirino-Avelino case]] splitting the certificates of votes into half. Angara appealed the case before the Supreme Court and reversed the COMELEC decision. Lacson resigned from the [[Laban ng Demokratikong Pilipino]] (LDP) upon hearing the news.<ref>Cervantes, Ding (May 17, 2004). [http://www.philstar.com/headlines/250321/angara-ldp-will-emerge-stronger-without-lacson Angara: LDP will emerge stronger without Lacson]. ''The Philippine Star''</ref>

After resigning from the LDP, Lacson continued campaigning as an [[Independent politician|independent]] candidate in the elections. He finished third with 10.88% of the vote, ahead of former senator [[Raul Roco]] and Bro. [[Eddie Villanueva]].<ref>Presidential Museum and Library.

===Aquino Cabinet (2013-2015)===
In the aftermath of Super Typhoon Yolanda, that caused widespread destruction, substantial damage and death in several areas in the country, particularly in the Visayas, President Aquino appointed Lacson as Presidential Assistant for Rehabilitation and Recovery (PARR) with the mandate of unifying the efforts of government and other agencies involved in the rehabilitation and recovery efforts. His office crafted the Yolanda Comprehensive Rehabilitation and Recovery Plan (CRRP) with a PhP167 billion proposed funding, which provides for an overall strategic vision and integrated short-term, medium-term and long-term programs in the Yolanda-affected areas. Lacson's efforts in the Yolanda rehabilitation led to the institutionalization of certain mechanisms on rehabilitation of calamity-affected communities.

In December 2014, Lacson tendered his irrevocable resignation as PARR which took effect in February 2015. He recommended the transition of his office's accomplishments and best practices to a permanent government agency. Lacson viewed the scheduled sunset review of Republic Act 10121, otherwise known as “Philippine Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Act of 2010”, as an opportune time to propose possible remedial measures that will help improve the effectiveness of the law, especially on the aspect of disaster rehabilitation and recovery.

Lacson pointed out that while his mandate as PARR was to develop a rehabilitation plan, he had no authority to implement or manage funds.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.manilatimes.net/an-unforgettable-chapter-in-my-public-service-career/464119/|title=An unforgettable chapter in my public service career|date=November 8, 2018|work=The Manila Times|access-date=November 8, 2018|language=en-US}}</ref>

== Anti-Pork Advocacy ==
In late 2016, Lacson discovered and moved to take out some P8.3 billion in "pork-like" insertions made by the House of Representatives. Lacson noted House members were allowed to identify P80 million worth of projects before the submission of the 2017 National Expenditure Program to Congress for deliberations – the pork barrel system already declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2016/12/01/1649240/senate-removes-p8.3-b-pork-dpwh-budget|title=Senate removes P8.3-B 'pork' from DPWH budget|last=Sy|first=Marvin|work=The Philippine Star|access-date=July 10, 2017|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161202101451/http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2016/12/01/1649240/senate-removes-p8.3-b-pork-dpwh-budget|archive-date=December 2, 2016}}</ref> This prompted the Senate to realign P8.3 billion in the proposed 2017 national budget to cover tuition of students in state colleges and universities.

For the 2019 budget, Lacson raised questions about the post-ratification tweaks made by the House leadership to the spending bill, saying this would violate the 1987 Constitution's Art. VI, Sec. 26, Paragraph 2: “Upon the last reading of a bill, no amendment thereto SHALL be allowed.” He also noted P72.319 billion was slashed from the DPWH's MFO 1 and 2, which covers the Duterte administration's “Build Build Build” program. The projects under the MFO (Major Final Output) had already been planned and vetted.

Meanwhile, in the proposed 2020 budget, Lacson cited information from some House members of a plan to give each district P700 million, and each of 22 deputy Speakers P1.5 billion. The plan was eventually scrapped.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://cebudailynews.inquirer.net/260136/plan-to-give-p1-5-billion-to-each-house-deputy-scrapped-lacson|title=Plan to give P1.5 billion to each House deputy scrapped – Lacson|work=Philippine Daily Inquirer|language=en|access-date=2019-09-27}}</ref> Lacson's revelations prompted some House members to demand an apology from Lacson,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://news.abs-cbn.com/news/09/25/19/solons-blast-lacson-demand-apology-over-claims-of-pork-in-proposed-2020-natl-budget|title=Solons blast Lacson, demand apology over claims of pork in proposed 2020 nat'l budget|work=ABS-CBN News|access-date=2019-09-27}}</ref>  but Lacson said there is nothing to apologize for, as he is guarding the budget.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1169471/lacson-stands-firm-spurns-solons-call-for-apology-over-pork-claims|title=Lacson stands firm, spurns solon's call for apology over 'pork' claims|last=Ager|first=Maila|work=Philippine Daily Inquirer|language=en|access-date=2019-09-27}}</ref> House members demanded that he named his sources, but Lacson refused,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1169639/lacson-reason-why-i-get-more-info-than-others-discipline-to-protect-sources|title=Lacson: Reason why I get more info than others?

== Exposing "Tara (payoffs)" System at the Bureau of Customs ==
On August 23, 2017, Lacson delivered a privilege speech at the Senate, where he narrated details of corruption at the [[Bureau of Customs]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT6kg00BgFc|title=Privilege Speech: Kita-Kita (sa Customs)|date=August 23, 2017|work=Panfilo "Ping" Lacson|access-date=September 28, 2017|language=en-US}}</ref> This led to Faeldon being cited in contempt by the Senate Blue Ribbon Committee after he refused to testify in the probe on illegal drugs.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://cnnphilippines.com/news/2017/09/07/Senate-cites-Faeldon-in-contempt-skipping-illegal-drugs-probe.html|title=Senate cites Faeldon in contempt for skipping probe on illegal drugs|work=CNN Philippines|access-date=September 28, 2017|language=en}}</ref>

On September 28, Lacson filed charges against Faeldon and several others before the Office of the Ombudsman over rice smuggling in March 2017.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://pinglacson.net/2017/09/28/first-of-many-cases-lacson-hales-faeldon-and-company-before-ombudsman-over-rice-smuggling/|title=First of many cases: Lacson hales Faeldon and company before Ombudsman over rice smuggling|date=September 28, 2017|work=Panfilo "Ping" Lacson|access-date=September 28, 2017|language=en-US}}</ref>

== Detailing "Conflict of Interest" at the DOH, PhilHealth ==
In a privilege speech on July 29, 2019, Lacson detailed how the [[Philippine Health Insurance Corporation|Philippine Health Insurance Corp. (PhilHealth)]] was spending beyond its means while its higher-ups "seem to turn a blind eye." He said this was due partly to the new reimbursement rates where PhilHealth "pays per case and not by actual expenses."<ref name="says">{{Cite web|url=https://pinglacson.net/2019/07/29/philwealth-and-department-of-wealth/|title=PhilWealth and Department of Wealth|last=says|first=Jonathan Clavacio|date=2019-07-29|website=PANFILO 'PING' LACSON|language=en-US|access-date=2019-07-31}}</ref>

Lacson also bared WellMed, a company suspended for making fake benefit claims, was still receiving payments from PhilHealth.<ref name="says"/>

Also, Lacson said the family of Health Secretary and ex-oficio PhilHealth chairman Francisco Duque III had entered into a lease agreement with PhilHealth's Region 1 office where the agency rented the building owned by the Duque family's EMDC in Dagupan City. Lacson said a General Information Sheet of EMDC showed Secretary Duque was among the stockholders of the company, thus indicating a conflict of interest.

In addition, Lacson said Doctors Pharmaceuticals Inc., a company owned by Secretary Duque's relatives, bids for government contracts with the DOH. The company was found in 2015 by the Food and Drug Administration of manufacturing for other companies, and was slapped a cease-and-desist order in June 2015. The FDA also ordered the recall of all drug products, but a tip that prompted an FDA inspection showed the firm was still operating. The FDA also found non-conformance with Good Manufacturing Practice.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pinglacson.net/2019/07/30/a-closer-look-doctors-pharmaceuticals-inc/|title=A Closer Look: Doctors Pharmaceuticals, Inc.|date=2019-07-30|website=PANFILO 'PING' LACSON|language=en-US|access-date=2019-07-31}}</ref>

== "Designated Survivor" Bill ==
On August 28, 2019, Lacson filed Senate Bill 982, an "Act Prescribing the Order of Presidential Succession."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pinglacson.net/2019/08/29/pingbills-lacson-files-designated-survivor-bill-to-ensure-govt-stability/|title=PingBills {{!}} Lacson Files 'Designated Survivor' Bill to Ensure Gov't Stability|date=2019-08-29|website=PANFILO 'PING' LACSON|language=en-US|access-date=2019-08-29}}</ref> The bill was also known as the "[[Designated Survivor (TV series)|Designated Survivor]]" bill due to its similarity to the US and [[Designated Survivor: 60 Days|Korean]] shows that featured a designated official being kept in a safe, remote area to act as president should the President and his/her successors be killed or incapacitated in a terrorist attack or major calamity. Lacson confirmed<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pinglacson.net/2019/08/29/pingsays-on-the-designated-survivor-bill-release-of-chinese-drug-lords-aug-29-2019/|title=#PingSays: On the 'Designated Survivor' Bill; Release of Chinese drug lords {{!}} Aug. 29, 2019|date=2019-08-29|website=PANFILO 'PING' LACSON|language=en-US|access-date=2019-08-29}}</ref> he drew inspiration from the [[Netflix]] show.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.spot.ph/newsfeatures/the-latest-news-features/78952/designated-survivor-bill-lacson-show-a4362-20190829|title=Yes, the "Designated Survivor" Bill Was Inspired By the Show|last=ago|first=Mia Rodriguez 2 hours|website=SPOT.PH|language=en|access-date=2019-08-29}}</ref>

== Proposed Philippine Building Act ==
In the wake of recent quakes that hit Mindanao, Lacson filed Senate Bill 1239, updating the 1977 National Building Code. "Experience tells us that there is an urgent need to strengthen the overall policy on how buildings and structures are built in the country. Not to mention the country’s geographical location along the boundary of major tectonic plates and at the center of the typhoon belt, coupled by its socially and economically vulnerable population, it becomes even more imperative to review our four-decade-old National Building Code," Lacson said.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pinglacson.net/2019/12/22/for-disaster-resiliency-lacson-bill-strengthens-building-safety-standards/|title=PingBills {{!}} For Disaster Resiliency: Lacson Bill Strengthens Building Safety Standards|date=2019-12-22|website=PANFILO 'PING' LACSON|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-10}}</ref>

== R&D Advocacy ==
Lacson pushed for bigger state investments in research and development, which he noted accounts for only 0.4 percent of the national budget from 2016 to 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pinglacson.net/2020/02/02/malaking-maitutulong-lacson-pushes-bigger-state-investment-in-r-d-for-disaster-preparedness/|title=Malaking Maitutulong: Lacson Pushes Bigger State Investment in R & D for Disaster Preparedness|date=2020-02-02|website=PANFILO 'PING' LACSON|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-16}}</ref> To remedy this, he proposed increases in the R&D budget of the Department of Science and Technology, including a P250M increase for the Office of the Secretary; P50M increase for the Science for Change Program: Niche Center in the Regions for Research and Development (NICER); P100M for the Space Technology and Applications Mastery, Innovation and Advancement (STAMINA4Space); and P100M for the Collaborative Research and Development to Leverage Philippine Economy (CRADLE) program.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pinglacson.net/2019/12/04/in-the-spirit-of-transparency-lacson-details-proposed-institutional-amendments-in-2020-budget/|title=In the Spirit of Transparency: Lacson Details Proposed Institutional Amendments in 2020 Budget|date=2019-12-04|website=PANFILO 'PING' LACSON|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-16}}</ref>

Lacson is one of the authors and the sponsor in the Senate of what is now Republic Act 11479, the [[Anti-Terrorism Act of 2020]],<ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-07-03|title=Read: RA 11479, The Anti-Terrorism Act of 2020|url=https://pinglacson.net/2020/07/03/read-ra-11479-the-anti-terrorism-act-of-2020/|access-date=2020-07-05|website=PANFILO 'PING' LACSON|language=en-US}}</ref> signed into law by President [[Rodrigo Duterte]] on July 3, 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Duterte signs anti-terror bill into law|url=https://www.msn.com/en-ph/news/national/duterte-signs-anti-terror-bill-into-law/ar-BB16i5oz?li=BBr8Mkn|access-date=2020-07-05|website=www.msn.com}}</ref> The law replaces the [[Human Security Act of 2007]] (RA 9372),<ref>{{Cite web|title=University of Minnesota Human Rights Library|url=http://hrlibrary.umn.edu/research/Philippines/RA_9372.html|access-date=2020-07-05|website=hrlibrary.umn.edu}}</ref> which he noted became a dead-letter law as some of its provisions - including a P500,000 daily penalty for the wrongful detention of a suspected terrorist - discouraged law enforcers from using it to charge suspected terrorists. In more than 10 years in effect, the 2007 law resulted in just one conviction and just one proscribed terrorist organization such as the Abu Sayyaf Group, he added.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Moaje |first1=Marita |title=Lacson, Esperon cite weaknesses of Human Security Act |url=https://www.pna.gov.ph/articles/1106241 |access-date=30 July 2020 |work=Philippine News Agency|date=17 June 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200712232541/https://www.pna.gov.ph/articles/1106241 |archive-date=12 July 2020 |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-06-04|title=To Protect, Not Destroy: Countering the Massive Disinformation Campaign Against the Anti-Terrorism Bill|url=https://pinglacson.net/2020/06/04/to-protect-not-destroy-countering-the-massive-disinformation-campaign-against-the-anti-terrorism-bill/|access-date=2020-07-05|website=PANFILO 'PING' LACSON|language=en-US}}</ref>

Shortly after assuming his Senate post in 2016, Lacson filed a bill providing free irrigation for farmers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.senate.gov.ph/lis/bill_res.aspx?congress=17&q=SBN-43|title=17th Congress - Senate Bill No. 43 - Senate of the Philippines|website=www.senate.gov.ph|access-date=February 13, 2018}}</ref> The bill was consolidated in '''Senate Bill 1465''', which along with House Bill 5670 were the basis for Republic Act 10969<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/cnnphilippines/status/961803199119212544|title=President Duterte signs RA 10969, which provides free irrigation service to farmers|last=Philippines|first=C.

=== Anti-hazing law (Republic Act 11053) ===
Lacson chaired a Senate committee investigation into the [[List of hazing deaths in the Philippines|fatal hazing]] of law student [[Horacio Castillo, III|Horacio "Atio" Castillo III]] in September 2017. The probe found indications of a cover-up attempt via Facebook chat<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://pinglacson.net/2017/10/18/at-a-glance-social-media-chat-among-members-of-the-aegis-juris-fraternity-regarding-the-death-of-atio-castillo-iii/|title=At a Glance: Social media chat among members of the Aegis Juris fraternity, regarding the death of 'Atio' Castillo III|date=October 18, 2017|work=Panfilo "Ping" Lacson|access-date=February 13, 2018|language=en-US}}</ref> by Aegis Jvris fraternity, the organization Castillo sought to join. The probe resulted in '''Senate Bill 1662''',<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.senate.gov.ph/lis/bill_res.aspx?congress=17&q=SBN-1662|title=17th Congress - Senate Bill No. 1662 - Senate of the Philippines|website=www.senate.gov.ph|access-date=February 13, 2018}}</ref> which updated the existing [[Anti-Hazing Act of 1995]] by imposing heavier penalties on hazing. The bill passed third and final reading in the Senate on February 12, 2018.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.senate.gov.ph/press_release/2018/0212_prib1.asp|title=Press Release - PRIB: Senate passes Lacson-sponsored anti-hazing bill|website=www.senate.gov.ph|access-date=February 13, 2018}}</ref> It also passed the bicameral conference committee on February 28, 2018. The bill finally became a law after President Rodrigo Duterte signed it on June 29, 2018.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://cnnphilippines.com/news/2018/07/11/Law-ban-hazing-Duterte-Atio-Castillo.html|title=Duterte signs new law banning hazing|work=CNN Philippines|access-date=July 12, 2018|language=en}}</ref>

Under the new law, the definition of hazing was expanded to include “physical or psychological suffering, harm or injury inflicted on a recruit, member, neophyte, or applicant” as a prerequisite for admission or for continued membership in an organization. Banned under the law are “all forms of hazing” not only in fraternities, sororities or organizations in schools, but also those in communities and even businesses and uniformed service learning institutions.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://pinglacson.net/2018/07/11/lacson-sponsored-measure-providing-heavier-penalties-vs-hazing-deaths-signed-into-law/#more-10137|title=Lacson-Sponsored Measure Providing Heavier Penalties vs Hazing Signed Into Law|date=July 11, 2018|work=Panfilo "Ping" Lacson|access-date=July 12, 2018|language=en-US}}</ref>

The law also requires schools to be “more active and proactive” in regulating school-based initiation rites, with schools required to exercise reasonable supervision and take proactive steps to protect students from danger of participating in activities that will involve hazing. Penalties include imprisonment of up to 40 years and fines of up to PHP3 million.

'''*''' Amendment to the Anti-Money Laundering Act to include casinos as covered persons.

=== National ID law (Republic Act 11055) ===
Lacson sponsored the bill seeking to establish a National ID system in the Philippines. In his sponsorship speech, Lacson said the National ID system seeks to harmonize, integrate and interconnect the "countless and redundant" government-issued ID cards.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://pinglacson.net/2018/03/12/sponsorship-speech-for-the-national-id-system-bill-march-12-2018/|title=Sponsorship Speech for the Philippine Identification System (National ID) Bill|date=March 12, 2018|work=Panfilo "Ping" Lacson|access-date=March 26, 2018|language=en-US}}</ref> The proposed measure – '''Senate Bill 1738''' – was approved in the Senate with a vote of 17–2 on March 19, 2018.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.senate.gov.ph/press_release/2018/0319_prib1.asp|title=Press Release - PRIB: Senate OKs Lacson bill on national ID system|website=www.senate.gov.ph|access-date=March 24, 2018}}</ref>

=== PNP rank classification law (Republic Act 11200) ===
On February 8, 2019, President Rodrigo Duterte signed into law '''Republic Act 11200''', which provides for a rank classification in the Philippine National Police.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/2019/02/08/republic-act-no-11200/|title=Republic Act No. 11200|website=Official Gazette of the Republic of the Philippines|language=en-US|access-date=2019-02-21}}</ref> Lacson said the new law, where he is the principal author<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pinglacson.net/2018/07/16/read-senate-bill-1869-an-act-providing-for-the-rank-classification-in-the-pnp/|title=Read: Senate Bill 1869, An Act Providing for the Rank Classification in the PNP|date=2018-07-16|website=Panfilo "Ping" Lacson|language=en-US|access-date=2019-02-22}}</ref> and sponsor,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pinglacson.net/2018/10/01/sponsorship-speech-committee-report-on-senate-bill-2031-rank-classification-in-the-pnp/|title=Sponsorship Speech: Committee Report on Senate Bill 2031 (Rank Classification in the PNP)|date=2018-10-01|website=Panfilo "Ping" Lacson|language=en-US|access-date=2019-02-22}}</ref> eliminates confusion on how PNP officers must be addressed, but more importantly, "allows for better coordination between the PNP and other law enforcement units in countering terrorism and other threats to national security." He added: "We cannot afford any delay in coordination in counter-terrorism operations and operations against other threats to national security."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pinglacson.net/2019/02/21/double-benefit-lacson-bill-on-pnp-rank-classification-signed-into-law/|title=Double Benefit: Lacson Bill on PNP Rank Classification Signed into Law|date=2019-02-21|website=Panfilo "Ping" Lacson|language=en-US|access-date=2019-02-21}}</ref>

=== Anti-Terrorism Act of 2020 (Republic Act 11479) ===
Lacson sponsored in the Senate what is now The Anti-Terrorism Act of 2020 (Republic Act 11479).<ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-07-03|title=Read: RA 11479, The Anti-Terrorism Act of 2020|url=https://pinglacson.net/2020/07/03/read-ra-11479-the-anti-terrorism-act-of-2020/|access-date=2020-07-05|website=PANFILO 'PING' LACSON|language=en-US}}</ref> In his sponsorship speech for the measure in October 2019, Lacson said the country needs "a legal framework for anti-terrorism that is clear, concise, balanced, and rational." He added the 2007 Human Security Act - which the 2020 anti-terror law replaced - had become a dead-letter law, with only one conviction in the more than 10 years it was in effect.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2019-10-02|title=Sponsorship Speech for the Anti-Terrorism Act of 2019 (18th Congress)|url=https://pinglacson.net/2019/10/02/sponsorship-speech-for-the-anti-terrorism-act-of-2019-18th-congress/|access-date=2020-07-05|website=PANFILO 'PING' LACSON|language=en-US}}</ref>

Also, Lacson pointed out the Anti-Terrorism Act of 2020 fills the gaps in the 2007 law by making punishable inchoate offenses - Section 6 penalizes planning, training, preparing and facilitating the commission of terrorism - as well as providing the mechanism allowing the freezing of assets used to finance terrorism.<ref name=":2" />

But he stressed the law is not meant to stifle dissent as claimed by some groups, as Section 4 makes clear it does not cover advocacy, protest, dissent, stoppage of work, industrial or mass action, and other similar exercises of civil and political rights that are not intended to cause death or serious physical harm to a person, to endanger a person's life, or to create a serious risk to public safety.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-07-03|title=Read: RA 11479, The Anti-Terrorism Act of 2020|url=https://pinglacson.net/2020/07/03/read-ra-11479-the-anti-terrorism-act-of-2020/|access-date=2020-07-05|website=PANFILO 'PING' LACSON|language=en-US}}</ref> Lacson said he is ready to closely monitor and call out potential abuses in the implementation of the law, adding he will not allow anyone to pervert the legislative intent of the measure that he had painstakingly sponsored on the Senate floor.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

He noted the bill had gone through the gauntlet in the legislative branch, with its provisions earning the nod of constitutionalists and legal heavyweights in both houses of Congress.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-06-14|title=Going All In on the Constitutionality of the Anti-Terrorism Act of 2020|url=https://pinglacson.net/2020/06/14/going-all-in-on-the-constitutionality-of-the-anti-terrorism-act-of-2020/|access-date=2020-07-05|website=PANFILO 'PING' LACSON|language=en-US}}</ref>
