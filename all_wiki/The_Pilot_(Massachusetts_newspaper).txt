'''''The Pilot''''' is the official newspaper of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Boston|Archdiocese of Boston]] and claims the title of "America's Oldest Catholic Newspaper", having been in continuous publication since its first issue on September 5, 1829.  Although the first Catholic newspaper in the United States, ''[[The Catholic Miscellany|The United States Catholic Miscellany]]'' of [[Charleston, South Carolina]], was founded seven years earlier in 1822, it ceased publication in 1861.

The paper was founded by Bishop [[Benedict Joseph Fenwick]], the second bishop of Boston, at a time of increased Irish immigration to the United States and rising anti-Catholic [[wiktionary:animus|animus]] to the newcomers' church. In its first edition, Bishop Fenwick wrote that the newspaper's purpose was to defend against the "crying calumnies and gross misrepresentations which in this section of the country have been so long, so unsparingly, so cruelly heaped upon the Church."<ref name="Pilot">[http://infowanted.bc.edu/history/briefhistory/ A Brief History of the ''Boston Pilot''], ''Information Wanted,'' Database of Irish immigrants, Boston College, accessed 16 April 2011</ref>

In 1834, Fenwick sold the publication to two laymen—Henry Devereux, the publisher, and [[Patrick Donahoe]], an employee who quickly became the newspaper's sole proprietor. In 1838, Donahoe became editor, and he maintained control of the newspaper until his death in 1891. During much of the 19th century, ''The Pilot'' acquired a reputation of being an Irish-American cultural newspaper.  The great majority of Boston's Catholics were originally immigrants from Ireland, with tens of thousands arriving during and after the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Famine]].  Notable editors linked to the movement for Irish independence include [[John Boyle O'Reilly]], [[James Jeffrey Roche]] and [[Thomas D'Arcy McGee]].<ref name="Pilot"/>

Archbishop [[William Henry O'Connell]] purchased the paper in 1908 and turned it into the official voice of Boston's [[archdiocese]]. He closely monitored its editorial policies and sought to promote its readership among local Catholic families. In 1979, ''The Pilot'' celebrated its 150th anniversary and featured special information about the newspaper's history. As of 2004, its circulation was of 23,039 printed copies.<ref name="Pilot"/>

In 2006, the newspaper launched its online edition, TheBostonPilot.com, which offers expanded content and multimedia features.

==Titles==
Beginning as '''''The Jesuit or Catholic Sentinel''''', the newspaper's name was changed several times in its first seven years. Titles included '''''The Jesuit''''', '''''The United States Catholic Intelligencer''''', and '''''The Literary and Catholic Sentinel'''''. By 1836, Patrick Donahoe changed the name of the newspaper to '''''The Boston Pilot''''', partly in tribute to the ''[[Dublin Pilot]]''.<ref name="Pilot"/>

In 1858, the newspaper's Old English nameplate ''The Pilot'' appeared for the first time, under the editorship of Father Joseph M. Finotti, along with the motto, "Be just and fear not, let all the ends thou aim'st at be thy God's, thy Country's and Truth's".<ref name="Pilot"/> Despite the fact that the name ''The Pilot'' and its logo have remained essentially unchanged for over 150 years, it is not uncommon for the newspaper to be referred to as ''The Boston Pilot'' to this day.
