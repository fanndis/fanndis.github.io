==Style and concepts==
Chukwuogo-Roy created paintings, prints and sculptures that are predominantly [[Figurative art|figurative]], in the genres of [[portrait]]ure, [[still-life]], [[landscape]] and narrative subjects.

However, she also created many works that, according to Sandra Gibson, writing for ''Nerve'', elicit "complex feelings of desperation, dread and aspiration".<ref>Sandra Gibson, [http://www.catalystmedia.org.uk/issues/misc/reviews/hawkins_co.php "Contemporary Arts Centre, Greenland Street, 7th March – 5th May 2008"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511191517/http://www.catalystmedia.org.uk/issues/misc/reviews/hawkins_co.php |date=11 May 2008 }} (review), Nerve.</ref> Notable among such works are her "Migrants" series and her "African Slave Trade" series.<ref>[http://www.ngrguardiannews.com/index.php?option=com_content&id=108896%3Achinwe-roy-queens-portraitist-passes-on&Itemid=492 "Chinwe Roy, Queen's Portraitist Passes On"], ''The Guardian'' (Nigeria), 29 December 2012.</ref>
