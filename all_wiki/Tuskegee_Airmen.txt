The '''Tuskegee Airmen''' {{IPAc-en|t|ʌ|s|ˈ|k|iː|ɡ|iː}}<ref>See [http://www.thefreedictionary.com/Tuskegee "Pronunciation of Tuskegee"], thefreedictionary.com; retrieved 3 October 2010.</ref>
were a group of primarily [[African-American]] military pilots (fighter and bomber) and airmen who fought in [[World War II]]. They formed the [[332d Expeditionary Operations Group|332nd Expeditionary Operations Group]] and the [[477th Fighter Group|477th Bombardment Group]] of the [[United States Army Air Forces]]. The name also applies to the navigators, bombardiers, mechanics, instructors, crew chiefs, nurses, cooks and other support personnel.

All black military pilots who trained in the United States trained at Griel Field, Kennedy Field, [[Moton Field]], Shorter Field and the Tuskegee Army Air Fields.<ref name=":1">{{Cite journal|last=Haulman|first=Daniel L.|date=June 2014|title=The Tuskegee Airmen Airfields|journal=Air Force Magazine|pages=63}}</ref>  They were educated at [[Tuskegee University|Tuskegee Institute]] (latterly Tuskegee University), located near [[Tuskegee, Alabama]].

The [[99th Pursuit Squadron]] (later the 99th Fighter Squadron) was the first black flying squadron, and the first to deploy overseas (to North Africa in April 1943, and later to Sicily and Italy). The [[332nd Fighter Group]], which originally included the 100th, 301st and 302nd Fighter Squadrons, was the first black flying group. It deployed to Italy in early 1944. Although the 477th Bombardment Group trained with [[North American B-25 Mitchell]] bombers, they never served in combat. In June 1944, the 332nd Fighter Group began flying heavy bomber escort missions and, in July 1944, with the addition of the 99th Fighter Squadron, it had four fighter squadrons.

The 99th Fighter Squadron was initially equipped with [[Curtiss P-40 Warhawk]] fighter-bomber aircraft. The 332nd Fighter Group and its 100th, 301st and 302nd Fighter Squadrons were equipped for initial combat missions with [[Bell P-39 Airacobra]]s (March 1944), later with [[Republic P-47 Thunderbolt]]s (June–July 1944) and finally with the aircraft with which they became most commonly associated, the [[North American P-51 Mustang]] (July 1944). When the pilots of the 332nd Fighter Group painted the tails of their P-47s red, the nickname "Red Tails" was coined. The red markings that distinguished the Tuskegee Airmen included red bands on the noses of P-51s as well as a red rudder; the P-51B and D Mustangs flew with similar color schemes, with red propeller spinners, yellow wing bands and all-red tail surfaces.

The Tuskegee Airmen were the first African-American military aviators in the United States Armed Forces. During World War II, black Americans in many U.S. states were still subject to the [[Jim Crow laws]]{{#tag:ref|U.S. state and local laws enacted between 1876 and 1965 that mandated ''de jure'' racial segregation in all public activities were collectively known as the "Jim Crow laws"; the name derivation from a contemporary pejorative for Black Americans.<ref>Woodward and McFeely (2001), p. 6.</ref>|group=N}} and the American military was [[Racial segregation in the United States|racially segregated]], as was much of the federal government. The Tuskegee Airmen were subjected to discrimination, both within and outside the army.

Before the Tuskegee Airmen, no African-American had been a U.S. military [[aviator|pilot]]. In 1917, African-American men had tried to become aerial observers but were rejected.<ref name="Francis pp. 38–29">Francis and Caso 1997, pp. 38–39.</ref> African-American [[Eugene Bullard]] served in the French air service during World War I because he was not allowed to serve in an American unit. Instead, Bullard returned to infantry duty with the French.<ref>Lloyd 2000, p. 176.</ref>

The racially motivated rejections of World War I African-American recruits sparked more than two decades of advocacy by African-Americans who wished to enlist and train as military aviators. The effort was led by such prominent [[civil rights]] leaders as [[Walter Francis White|Walter White]] of the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]], labor union leader [[A.&nbsp;Philip Randolph]] and Judge [[William&nbsp;H. Hastie]]. Finally, on 3 April 1939, Appropriations Bill Public Law 18 was passed by Congress containing an amendment by Senator [[Henry H. Schwartz|Harry H. Schwartz]] designating funds for training African-American pilots. The [[United States Department of War|War Department]] managed to put the money into funds of civilian flight schools willing to train black Americans.<ref name="Francis pp. 38–29"/>

War Department tradition and policy mandated the segregation of African-Americans into separate military units staffed by white officers, as had been done previously with the [[9th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|9th Cavalry]], [[10th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|10th Cavalry]], [[24th Infantry Regiment (United States)|24th Infantry Regiment]] and [[25th Infantry Regiment (United States)|25th Infantry Regiment]]. When the appropriation of funds for aviation training created opportunities for pilot cadets, their numbers diminished the rosters of these older units.<ref name="Moye 2010, p. 19">Moye 2010, p. 19.</ref> In 1941, the War Department and the Army Air Corps, under pressure — [[1941 in aviation#June|three months]] before its transformation into the [[USAAF]] — constituted the first all-black flying unit, the 99th Pursuit Squadron.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www2.gwu.edu/~erpapers/teachinger/glossary/tuskegee-airmen.cfm|title=The Tuskegee Airmen}}</ref>

Because of the restrictive nature of selection policies, the situation did not seem promising for African-Americans, since in 1940 the U.S. Census Bureau reported there were only 124 African-American pilots in the nation.<ref>Moye 2010, p. 25.</ref> The exclusionary policies failed dramatically when the Air Corps received an abundance of applications from men who qualified, even under the restrictive requirements. Many of the applicants already had participated in the [[Civilian Pilot Training Program]], unveiled in late December 1938 (CPTP). [[Tuskegee University]] had participated since 1939.<ref>Benton 1999, p. 43.</ref>

===Testing===
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2017}}
The U.S. Army Air Corps had established the [[List of psychological research methods|Psychological Research Unit 1]] at [[Maxwell Army Air Field]], [[Montgomery, Alabama]], and other units around the country for aviation cadet training, which included the identification, selection, education, and training of pilots, [[flight officer|navigators]] and [[bombardier (air force)|bombardiers]]. Psychologists employed in these research studies and training programs used some of the first [[standardized tests]] to quantify [[IQ]]<!---{{dubious|first IQ tests were Binet-Simon, which led to [[Stanford-Binet]], which led to [[Army Alpha]], which was in use in World War One|date=September 2011}}--->, dexterity and leadership qualities to select and train the best-suited personnel for the roles of bombardier, navigator, and pilot. The Air Corps determined that the existing programs would be used for all units, including all-black units. At Tuskegee, this effort continued with the selection and training of the Tuskegee Airmen. The War Department set up a system to accept only those with a level of flight experience or higher education which ensured that only the most able and intelligent African-American applicants were able to join.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Airman [[Coleman Young]], later the first African-American mayor of [[Detroit]], told journalist [[Studs Terkel]] about the process:
{{quote|They made the standards so high, we actually became an elite group. We were screened and super-screened. We were unquestionably the brightest and most physically fit young blacks in the country. We were super-better because of the irrational laws of Jim Crow. You can't bring that many intelligent young people together and train 'em as fighting men and expect them to supinely roll over when you try to fuck over 'em, right? (Laughs.)<ref>Terkel, Studs, American Dreams: Lost and Found, Patheon Books, 1080, pg. 359-360</ref>}}

===First Lady's flight===
The budding flight program at Tuskegee received a publicity boost when [[First Lady]] [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] inspected it on March 29, 1941, and flew with African-American chief civilian instructor [[C.&nbsp;Alfred "Chief" Anderson]]. Anderson, who had been flying since 1929 and was responsible for training thousands of rookie pilots, took his prestigious passenger on a half-hour flight in a [[Piper J-3 Cub]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.redtail.org/the-tuskegee-airmen/silver-wings-civil-rights|title=Mrs. Roosevelt Goes for a Ride - Red Tail Squadron|work=Red Tail Squadron|access-date=4 May 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160324113003/http://www.redtail.org/the-tuskegee-airmen/silver-wings-civil-rights/|archive-date=24 March 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> After landing, she cheerfully announced, "Well, you can fly all right."<ref name="Moye pp. 52–54">Moye 2010, pp. 52–54.</ref>

The subsequent brouhaha over the First Lady's flight had such an impact it is often mistakenly cited as the start of the CPTP at Tuskegee, even though the program was already five months old. Eleanor Roosevelt used her position as a trustee of the [[Julius Rosenwald Fund]] to arrange a loan of $175,000 to help finance the building of [[Tuskegee Airmen National Historic Site|Moton Field]].<ref name="Moye pp. 52–54"/>

On 22 March 1941, the [[99th Fighter Squadron|99th Pursuit Squadron]]{{#tag:ref|"Pursuit" being the U.S. term for "fighter" to May 1942.|group=N}} was activated without pilots at [[Chanute Field]] in [[Rantoul, Illinois]].<ref>Francis and Caso 1997, p. 15.</ref><ref>Moye 2010, pp. 26–37.</ref>{{#tag:ref|It may have been a lawsuit from a rejected candidate, that caused the USAAC to accept black applicants.

A cadre of 14 black non-commissioned officers from the 24th and 25th Infantry Regiments were sent to Chanute Field to help in the administration and supervision of the trainees. A white officer, Army Captain Harold R. Maddux, was assigned as the first commander of the 99th Fighter Squadron.<ref name=":2" /><ref name=":3">{{Cite book|last=Haulman|first=Daniel L.

While the enlisted men were in training, five black youths were admitted to the Officers Training School (OTS) at Chanute Field as aviation cadets.  Specifically, Elmer D. Jones, Dudley Stevenson and James Johnson of Washington, DC; Nelson Brooks of Illinois, and William R. Thompson of Pittsburgh, PA successfully completed OTS and were commissioned as the first Black Army Air Corps Officers.<ref name=":2" />

In June 1941, the 99th Pursuit Squadron was transferred to Tuskegee, Alabama and remained the only Black flying unit in the country, but did not yet have pilots.<ref name=":3" />  The famous airmen were actually trained at five airfields surrounding Tuskegee University (formerly Tuskegee Institute)--Griel, Kennedy, Moton, Shorter and Tuskegee Army Air Fields.<ref name=":1" />  The flying unit consisted of 47 officers and 429 enlisted men<ref>[http://www.nationalmuseum.af.mil/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=15469 "Fact sheet:Tuskegee Airmen"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101019085202/http://www.nationalmuseum.af.mil/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=15469 |date=19 October 2010 }}, National Museum of the United States Air Force website; retrieved 22 October 2010.</ref> and was backed by an entire service arm.

Consequently, Tuskegee Army Air Field became the only Army installation performing three phases of pilot training (basic, advanced, and transition) at a single location. Initial planning called for 500 personnel in residence at a time.<ref>Moye 2010, pp. 93–94.</ref>

By mid-1942, over six times that many were stationed at Tuskegee, even though only two squadrons were training there.<ref>Homan and Reilly, p. 68.</ref>

During training, Tuskegee Army Air Field was commanded first by Major James Ellison. Ellison made great progress in organizing the construction of the facilities needed for the military program at Tuskegee. However, he was transferred on 12 January 1942, reputedly because of his insistence that his African-American sentries and [[Military Police]] had police authority over local [[Caucasian race|Caucasian]] civilians.<ref>Francis and Caso 1997, p. 56.</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Jakeman, Robert J., 1948-|title=The Divided Skies Establishing Segregated Flight Training at Tuskegee, Alabama, 1934-1942|date=2015|publisher=University of Alabama Press|isbn=978-0-8173-9215-4|oclc=1132255062}}</ref>

His successor, Colonel [[Frederick von Kimble]], then oversaw operations at the Tuskegee airfield. Contrary to new Army regulations, Kimble maintained segregation on the field in deference to local customs in the state of Alabama, a policy that was resented by the airmen.<ref name="Francis p. 233"/> Later that year, the Air Corps replaced Kimble. His replacement had been the director of training at Tuskegee Army Airfield, Major [[Noel F. Parrish]].<ref name=amhert>Smith, Gene.

[[File:Airglasspilotcert-NPS.jpg|thumb|Instrument certificate for Tuskegee Airman Robert M. Glass, signed by Parrish]]
The strict racial segregation the U.S. Army required gave way in the face of the requirements for complex training in technical vocations. Typical of the process was the development of separate African-American [[flight surgeon]]s to support the operations and training of the Tuskegee Airmen.<ref name=FlightSurgeon>Jones, D.R., L.P. Gross and R. Marchbanks-Robinson. [http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/7973 "United States Army Aeromedical Support to African Fliers, 1941–1949: The Tuskegee Flight Surgeons"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091130014406/http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/7973 |date=30 November 2009 }}, ''SAM-FE-BR-TR-2007-0001: US Air Force School of Aerospace Medicine'' (2007); retrieved 20 March 2010.</ref> Before the development of this unit, no U.S. Army flight surgeons had been black.

Training of African-American men as aviation medical examiners was conducted through correspondence courses until 1943, when two black physicians were admitted to the U.S. Army School of Aviation Medicine at [[Randolph Field, Texas]]. This was one of the earliest racially integrated courses in the U.S. Army. Seventeen flight surgeons served with the Tuskegee Airmen from 1941-49. At that time, the typical tour of duty for a U.S. Army flight surgeon was four years. Six of these physicians lived under field conditions during operations in North Africa, Sicily, and Italy. The chief flight surgeon to the Tuskegee Airmen was [[Vance H. Marchbanks, Jr.]], MD, a childhood friend of Benjamin Davis.<ref name=FlightSurgeon/>

The accumulation of washed-out cadets at Tuskegee and the propensity of other commands to "dump" African-American personnel on the post exacerbated the difficulties of administering Tuskegee. A shortage of jobs for them made these enlisted men a drag on Tuskegee's housing and culinary departments.<ref name="Francis 1997, p. 214">Francis and Caso 1997, p. 214.</ref>

Trained officers were also left idle, as the plan to shift African-American officers into command slots stalled, and white officers not only continued to hold command, but were joined by additional white officers assigned to the post. One rationale behind the non-assignment of trained African-American officers was stated by the commanding officer of the Army Air Forces, General [[Henry "Hap" Arnold]]: "Negro pilots cannot be used in our present Air Corps units since this would result in Negro officers serving over white enlisted men creating an impossible social situation."<ref>Moye 2010, pp. 93–95.</ref>

==Combat assignment==

The 99th was finally considered ready for combat duty by April 1943. It shipped out of Tuskegee on 2 April, bound for North Africa, where it would join the 33rd Fighter Group and its commander, Colonel [[William Momyer|William W. Momyer]]. Given little guidance from battle-experienced pilots, the 99th's first combat mission was to attack the small strategic volcanic island of [[Pantelleria]], code name [[Operation Corkscrew]], in the [[Mediterranean Sea]] to clear the sea lanes for the [[Allied invasion of Sicily]] in July 1943. The air assault on the island began 30 May 1943.

By the end of February 1944, the all-black [[332nd Fighter Group]] had been sent overseas with three fighter squadrons: The [[100th Fighter Squadron|100th]], [[301st Fighter Squadron|301st]] and [[302d Fighter Squadron|302nd]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nationalmuseum.af.mil/Visit/Museum-Exhibits/Fact-Sheets/Display/Article/195963/escort-excellence/|title=Escort Excellence|website=National Museum of the US Air Force|language=en-US|access-date=31 December 2018}}</ref>

Under the command of Colonel Davis, the squadrons were moved to mainland Italy, where the 99th Fighter Squadron, assigned to the group on 1 May 1944, joined them on 6 June at [[Ramitelli Airfield]], nine kilometers south-southeast of the small city of [[Campomarino]], on the [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic coast]]. From Ramitelli, the 332nd Fighter Group escorted [[Fifteenth Air Force]] heavy strategic bombing raids into Czechoslovakia, Austria, Hungary, Poland and Germany.<ref name="332d"/>

Flying escort for heavy bombers, the 332nd earned an impressive combat record.

In May 1942, the 99th Pursuit Squadron was renamed the 99th Fighter Squadron. It earned three [[Distinguished Unit Citation#Army and Air Force|Distinguished Unit Citations]] (DUC) during World War II. The DUCs were for operations over Sicily from 30 May–11 June 1943, Monastery Hill near [[Battle of Monte Cassino|Cassino]] from 12–14 May 1944, and for successfully fighting off German jet aircraft on 24 March 1945.

==Tuskegee Airmen bomber units==
===Formation===
With African-American fighter pilots being trained successfully, the Army Air Force now came under political pressure from the [[NAACP]] and other civil rights organizations to organize a bomber unit. There could be no defensible argument that the quota of 100 African-American pilots in training at one time,<ref name="Moye p. 123">Moye 2010, p. 123.</ref> or 200 per year out of a total of 60,000 American aviation cadets in annual training,<ref>Francis and Caso 1997, p. 219.</ref> represented the service potential of 13 million African-Americans.{{#tag:ref|The physical requirements that made it possible to fit in a fighter's cockpit with a height less than 70 inches, weight under 170 pounds, precluded many larger African-American men from eligibility.<ref name="Moye p. 123"/>|group=N}}

On 13 May 1943, the 616th Bombardment Squadron was established as the initial subordinate squadron of the [[477th Fighter Group|477th Bombardment Group]], an all-white group. The squadron was activated on 1 July 1943, only to be inactivated on 15 August 1943.<ref name="Francis 1997, p. 214"/><ref name=":4">{{Cite book|last=Maurer, Maurer.|title=Air Force combat units of World War II|date=1994|publisher=Chartwell Books|isbn=0-7858-0194-4|oclc=30111671}}</ref><ref name=":5">{{Cite journal|title=477th Bombardment Group Lineage and Honors History|journal=Air Force Historical Research Agency}}</ref><ref name=":6">{{Cite journal|title=477th Bombardment Group Histories for 1943 and 1944|journal=Air Force Historical Research Agency}}</ref> By September 1943, the number of washed-out cadets on base had surged to 286, with few of them working. In January 1944, the 477th Bombardment Group was reactivated—an all-Black group.<ref name=":4" /><ref name=":5" /><ref name=":6" /> At the time, the usual training cycle for a bombardment group took three to four months.<ref>Moye 2010, pp. 94, 124.</ref>

The 477th would eventually contain four medium bomber squadrons. Slated to comprise 1,200 officers and enlisted men, the unit would operate 60 [[North American B-25 Mitchell]] bombers.{{#tag:ref|Each B-25 bomber cost $175,000. Overall cost of the entire group was estimated at $20,000,000.<ref>Homan and Reilly 2001, p. 177.</ref>|group=N}} The 477th would go on to encompass three more bomber squadrons–the 617th Bombardment Squadron, the 618th Bombardment Squadron, and the 619th Bombardment Squadron.<ref>Francis and Caso 1997, p. 457.</ref> The 477th was anticipated to be ready for action in November 1944.<ref>Homan and Reilly 2001, p. 186.</ref>

The home field for the 477th was [[Selfridge Field]], located outside Detroit, however, other bases would be used for various types of training courses. Twin-engine pilot training began at Tuskegee while transition to multi-engine pilot training was at [[Mather AFB|Mather Field, California]]. Some ground crews trained at Mather before rotating to [[Inglewood, California|Inglewood]]. Gunners learned to shoot at [[Eglin AFB|Eglin Field, Florida]]. Bombers-navigators learned their trades at [[Hondo Army Air Field]] and [[Midland Air Field|Midland Air Field, Texas]] or at [[Roswell, New Mexico]]. Training of the new African-American crewmen also took place at [[Sioux Falls, South Dakota]], [[Lincoln, Nebraska]], and [[Scott Air Force Base|Scott Field, Belleville, Illinois]]. Once trained, the air and ground crews would be spliced into a working unit at Selfridge.<ref>Francis and Caso 1997, p. 207.</ref><ref>Homan and Reilly, pp. 180–82.</ref>

===Command difficulties===
The new group's first commanding officer was Colonel [[Robert Selway]], who had also commanded the 332nd Fighter Group before it deployed for combat overseas.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Haulman|first=Daniel L.|date=Summer 2018|title=A Tale of Two Commanders|journal=Air Power History|volume=65|pages=45{{en dash}}49}}</ref> Like his ranking officer, Major General [[Frank O'Driscoll Hunter]] from Georgia, Selway was a racial segregationist. Hunter was blunt about it, saying such things as, "...racial friction will occur if colored and white pilots are trained together."<ref name=":0">Homan & Reilly 2001 pp. 184, 187</ref> He backed Selway's violations of Army Regulation 210-10, which forbade segregation of air base facilities. They segregated base facilities so thoroughly that they even drew a line in the base theater and ordered separate seating by races. When the audience sat in random patterns as part of "Operation Checkerboard," the movie was halted to make men return to segregated seating.<ref>Homan and Reilly 2001, pp. 185–86.</ref> African-American officers petitioned base [[Commanding Officer]] William Boyd for access to the only [[Military officers' club|officer's club]] on base.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=B13CGJMiyOIC&pg=PA158|title=Strength for the Fight: A History of Black Americans in the Military|last=Nalty|first=Bernard C.|date=1989|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=9780029224113|page=158|language=en}}</ref><ref>Moye, 2010 p. 126</ref> Lieutenant Milton Henry entered the club and personally demanded his club rights; he was court-martialed for this.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=x8GSDgAAQBAJ&pg=PP163|title=Facing the Rising Sun: African Americans, Japan, and the Rise of Afro-Asian Solidarity|last=Horne|first=Gerald|date=16 January 2018|publisher=NYU Press|isbn=9781479854936|language=en}}</ref>

Subsequently, Colonel Boyd denied club rights to African-Americans, although General Hunter stepped in and promised a separate but equal club would be built for black airmen.<ref>Moye 2010, pp. 126–27.</ref> The 477th was transferred to [[Godman Field]], Kentucky before the club was built. They had spent five months at Selfridge but found themselves on a base a fraction of Selfridge's size, with no air-to-ground gunnery range and deteriorating runways that were too short for B-25 landings. Colonel Selway took on the second role of commanding officer of Godman Field. In that capacity, he ceded Godman Field's officers club to African-American airmen. Caucasian officers used the whites-only clubs at nearby Fort Knox, much to the displeasure of African-American officers.<ref>Moye 2010, pp. 128–29.</ref>

Another irritant was a professional one for African-American officers. They observed a steady flow of white officers through the command positions of the group and squadrons; these officers stayed just long enough to be "promotable" before transferring out at their new rank. This seemed to take about four months. In an extreme example, 22-year-old Robert Mattern was promoted to [[Captain (United States O-3)|captain]], transferred into squadron command in the 477th days later, and left a month later as a [[Major (United States)|major]]. He was replaced by another Caucasian officer. Meanwhile, no Tuskegee Airmen held command.<ref>Moye 2010, pp. 131–32.</ref>

On 15 March 1945,<ref name="Homan and Reilly p. 187">Homan and Reilly 2001, p. 187.</ref> the 477th was transferred to [[Freeman Field]], near [[Seymour, Indiana|Seymour]], Indiana. The white population of Freeman Field was 250 officers and 600 enlisted men. Superimposed on it were 400 African-American officers and 2,500 enlisted men of the 477th and its associated units. Freeman Field had a firing range, usable runways, and other amenities useful for training. African-American airmen would work in proximity with white ones; both would live in a public housing project adjacent to the base.<ref>Moye 2010, p. 132</ref><ref name=":0" />

Colonel Selway turned the noncommissioned officers out of their club and turned it into a second officers club. He then classified all white personnel as cadre and all African-Americans as trainees. One officers club became the cadre's club. The old [[Non-Commissioned Officer]]s Club, promptly sarcastically dubbed "Uncle Tom's Cabin", became the trainees' officers club. At least four of the trainees had flown combat in Europe as fighter pilots and had about four years in service. Four others had completed training as pilots, bombardiers and navigators and may have been the only triply qualified officers in the entire Air Corps. Several of the Tuskegee Airmen had logged over 900 flight hours by this time. Nevertheless, by Colonel Selway's fiat, they were trainees.<ref name="Homan and Reilly p. 187"/><ref>Moye 2010, pp. 132–33.</ref>

Off base was no better; many businesses in Seymour would not serve African-Americans. A local laundry would not wash their clothes and yet willingly laundered those of [[German prisoners of war in the United States|captured German soldiers]].<ref name="Homan and Reilly p. 187"/>

In early April 1945, the 118th Base Unit transferred in from Godman Field; its African-American personnel held orders that specified they were base cadre, not trainees. On 5 April, officers of the 477th peaceably tried to enter the whites-only officer's club. Selway had been tipped off by a phone call and had the assistant [[provost marshal]] and base billeting manager stationed at the door to refuse the 477th officers entry. The latter, a major, ordered them to leave and took their names as a means of arresting them when they refused. It was the beginning of the [[Freeman Field Mutiny]].<ref>Moye 2010, p. 133.</ref>

In the wake of the Freeman Field Mutiny, the 616th and 619th were disbanded and the returned 99th Fighter Squadron assigned to the 477th on 22 June 1945; it was redesignated the 477th Composite Group as a result. On 1&nbsp;July 1945, Colonel Robert Selway was relieved of the Group's command; he was replaced by Colonel [[Benjamin&nbsp;O. Davis, Jr.]] A complete sweep of Selway's white staff followed, with all vacated jobs filled by African-American officers. The war ended before the 477th Composite Group could get into action. The 618th Bombardment Squadron was disbanded on 8 October 1945. On 13 March 1946, the two-squadron group, supported by the 602nd Engineer Squadron (later renamed 602nd Air Engineer Squadron), the 118th Base Unit, and a band, moved to its final station, [[Lockbourne Field]]. The 617th Bombardment Squadron and the 99th Fighter Squadron disbanded on 1&nbsp;July 1947, ending the 477th Composite Group. It would be reorganized as the [[332nd Air Expeditionary Wing|332nd Fighter Wing]].<ref>Homan and Reilly 2001, pp. 206–08.</ref><ref>Francis and Caso. 1997, p. 263.</ref>

This statement was repeated for many years, and not publicly challenged, partly because the mission reports were classified for a number of years after the war.

Alan Gropman, a professor at the [[National Defense University]], disputed the initial refutations of the no-loss myth, and said he researched more than 200 Tuskegee Airmen mission reports and found no bombers were lost to enemy fighters.<ref name="An uneasy question."/> Dr. Daniel Haulman of the [[Air Force Historical Research Agency]] conducted a reassessment of the history of the unit in 2006 and early 2007.

This total included 15 B-17s of the [[483rd Bombardment Group]] shot down during a particularly savage air battle with an estimated 300 German fighters on 18 July 1944 that also resulted in nine kill credits and the award of five Distinguished Flying Crosses to members of the 332nd.<ref>Haulman, Dr. Daniel L.

Contrary to negative predictions from some quarters, Tuskegee Airmen were some of the best pilots in the U.S. Army Air Forces due to a combination of pre-war experience and the personal drive of those accepted for training.<!--measured how? see below--> Nevertheless, the Tuskegee Airmen continued to have to fight [[racism]]. Their combat record did much to quiet those directly involved with the group, but other units continued to harass these airmen.<ref name="Tuskegee Airmen Combat record">[http://www.tuskegeeairmen.org/Tuskegee_Airmen_History.html "Tuskegee Airmen History"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101130165710/http://tuskegeeairmen.org/Tuskegee_Airmen_History.html |date=30 November 2010 }}, Tuskegee airmen; retrieved 11 October 2010.</ref>
In 1949, the 332nd entered the annual U. S. Continental Gunnery Meet in Las Vegas, Nevada. The competition included shooting aerial targets, shooting targets on the ground and dropping bombs on targets. Flying the long range Republic P-47N Thunderbolt (built for the long range escort mission in the [[Pacific War|Pacific theatre of World War II]]), the 332nd Fighter Wing took first place in the conventional fighter class. The pilots were Capt. Alva Temple, Lts. Harry Stewart, James Harvey III and Herbert Alexander. Lt. Harvey said, "We had a perfect score. Three missions, two bombs per plane. We didn't guess at anything, we were good."<ref>''Aviation History Magazine'', March 2012.</ref><!--needs article title, author, page number---> They received congratulations from the Governor of Ohio, and Air Force commanders across the nation.<ref>Francis and Caso 1997, pp. 402–04.</ref>

[[Thurgood Marshall]], the future Supreme Court justice, got his start defending Tuskegee bomber trainees. The 477th Bombardment Group was formed in 1944 to extend the so-called "Tuskegee experiment" by allowing black aviators to serve on bomber crews. The aim was to send pilots—many of them veterans of the original Tuskegee fighter group—back to the States for training on B-25 bombers. While in Indiana, some of the African-American officers were arrested and charged with mutiny after entering an all-white officers' club. Marshall, then a young lawyer, represented the 100 black officers who had landed in jail as a result of the confrontation. The men were soon released (although one was later convicted of violent conduct and fined).<ref name="Facts">[http://www.history.com/news/the-tuskegee-airmen-5-fascinating-facts "History in the Headlines: The Tuskegee Airmen: 5 Fascinating Facts"], History.com, 20 January 2012; retrieved 9 July 2012.</ref>

Daniel "Chappie" James Jr. started his career in the early 1940s at Tuskegee, joining the Army Air Corps in July 1943. After the war ended, James stayed in what became the Air Force and flew missions in both Korea and Vietnam. In 1969, James was put in command of [[Wheelus Air Base]] outside of Tripoli.<ref name="Facts"/>

Four Tuskegee airmen went on to become generals. For keeping his cool in the face of Qaddafi's troops, James was appointed a brigadier general by President Nixon.
