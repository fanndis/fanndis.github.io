The '''Ludwig von Mises Institute for Austrian Economics''', or '''Mises Institute''', is a [[nonprofit]] [[think-tank]] located in [[Auburn, Alabama|Auburn]], [[Alabama]], [[United States]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/26/us/politics/rand-pauls-mixed-inheritance.html |title=Rand Paul's Mixed Inheritance |author=Sam Tanenhaus and Jim Rutenberg |newspaper=New York Times |date=25 January 2014 |accessdate=20 February 2014}}</ref>  It is named after [[Austrian School]] economist [[Ludwig von Mises]] (1881–1973).

The Mises Institute was founded in 1982 by [[Lew Rockwell]], [[Burton Blumert]], and [[Murray Rothbard]], following a split between the [[Cato Institute]] and Rothbard, who had been one of the founders of the Cato Institute. The Institute was funded by [[Ron Paul]].<ref name=WSJ-home />

The Ludwig von Mises Institute was established in 1982 in the wake of a dispute which occurred in the early 1980s between [[Murray Rothbard]] and the [[Cato Institute]], another libertarian organization co-founded by Rothbard.

Early after its founding, the Mises Institute was located at the business department offices of [[Auburn University]], and relocated nearby to its current site in 1998. According to ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', the [[Southern United States]] is a "natural home" for the Institute, as "Southerners have always been distrustful of government," with the founding of the Institute making the "Heart of Dixie a wellspring of sensible economic thinking."<ref name=WSJ-home>Wingfield, Kyle. "Auburnomics: Von Mises finds a sweet home in Alabama." ''Wall Street Journal''. August 11, 2006. [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB115526621313033079]</ref>

==Views espoused by founders and organization scholars==

The Institute is founded in Misesian [[praxeology]] ('the logic of action'), that holds that economic science is a deductive science rather than an empirical science. Developed by Ludwig von Mises, following the ''[[Methodenstreit]]'' opined by [[Carl Menger]], it is a self-conscious opposition to the mathematical modeling and hypothesis-testing used to justify knowledge in neoclassical economics. Externally, this economic method usually is considered a form of [[heterodox economics]].<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1111/j.1536-7150.2010.00751.x|title = Research Quality Rankings of Heterodox Economic Journals in a Contested Discipline|journal = American Journal of Economics and Sociology|volume = 69|issue = 5|pages = 1409–1452|year = 2010|last1 = Lee|first1 = Frederic S.|last2 = Cronin|first2 = Bruce C.|last3 = McConnell|first3 = Scott|last4 = Dean|first4 = Erik}}</ref>

==Criticisms==
A 2000 "Intelligence Report" by the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]] categorized the Institute as [[Neo-Confederate]], "devoted to a radical libertarian view of government and economics."<ref>{{cite web|title=The Neo-Confederates|work=Intelligence Report|publisher=[[Southern Poverty Law Center]]|date=Summer 2000| issue =99|url=https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/2000/neo-confederates}}</ref>

In 2003, [[Chip Berlet]] of the Southern Poverty Law Center described the Mises Institute as "a major center promoting libertarian political theory and the Austrian School of free market economics", also noting Rothbard's opposition to [[child labor laws]] and the anti-immigrant views of other Institute scholars.<ref>{{cite web|last=Berlet|first=Chip|title=Into the Mainstream|url=http://www.splcenter.org/get-informed/intelligence-report/browse-all-issues/2003/summer/into-the-mainstream?page=0,1#11|work=Intelligence Report |issue=110|publisher=[[Southern Poverty Law Center]]|accessdate=September 24, 2013|author-link=Chip Berlet|date=Summer 2003}}</ref>

In 2017, the president of the Mises Institute, Jeff Deist, gave a speech at the Mises University conference, where in his concluding remarks he stated that the ideas of "blood and soil and God and nation still matter to people".<ref>{{cite web|title=For a New Libertarian|url=https://mises.org/wire/new-libertarian}}</ref> Deist's use of the phrase [[blood and soil]], originally used by the [[Nazi party]] as a call for racial nationalism, was alleged by some to be an explicit signal to [[Neo-Nazi]]'s and other [[white nationalist]] groups. <ref>{{citation|url=http://www.unkochmycampus.org/los-ch2-part-4-the-ideas-austrian-economics-aka-classical-liberalism-a-gateway-to-extremism#part4|title=Austrian Economics: A Gateway to Extremism|accessdate=August 31, 2020}}</ref> In particular, [[Nicholas Sarwark]] and [[Arvin Vohra]], then the chair and vice-chair of the [[United States Libertarian Party]], condemned Deist's speech, with Vohra stating that "the Mises Institute has been turned into a sales funnel for the White Nationalist branch of the Alt Right". Vohra further accused the Mises Institute as a whole of being "authoritarian, racist, nazi".<ref>{{cite news | first = Matt | last = Welch | title = Libertarian Party Rebuffs Mises Uprising | url = https://reason.com/2018/07/04/libertarian-party-rebuffs-mises-uprising/ | work = Reason Magazine | date = July 4, 2018 | access-date = September 18, 2020 }}</ref>
