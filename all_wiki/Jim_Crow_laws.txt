In practice, Jim Crow laws mandated racial segregation in all public facilities in the states of the former [[Confederate States of America]] and in some others, beginning in the 1870s. Jim Crow laws were upheld in 1896 in the case of ''[[Plessy vs. Ferguson]]'', in which the U.S. Supreme Court laid out its "[[separate but equal]]" legal doctrine for facilities for African Americans. Moreover, [[State school|public education]] had essentially been segregated since its establishment in most of the South after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] in 1861–65.

The legal principle of "separate but equal" racial segregation was extended to public facilities and transportation, including the coaches of interstate trains and buses. Facilities for African Americans were consistently inferior and underfunded compared to facilities for [[white Americans]]; sometimes, there were no facilities for the black community.<ref name="tperd">{{cite web |last1=Perdue |first1=Theda |title=Legacy of Jim Crow for Southern Native Americans |url=https://www.c-span.org/video/?302379-1/legacy-jim-crow-southern-native-americans |website=C-SPAN |publisher=[[C-SPAN]] |accessdate=27 November 2018 |date=October 28, 2011}}</ref><ref name="jimlu">{{cite book |last1=Lowery |first1=Malinda Maynor |title=Lumbee Indians in the Jim Crow South: Race, Identity, and the Making of a Nation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vLY3XbAqDUwC|publisher=Univ of North Carolina Press |accessdate=27 November 2018 |pages=0–339 |date=January 1, 2010|isbn=9780807833681 }}</ref> As a body of law, Jim Crow institutionalized economic, educational, and social disadvantages for African Americans living in the South.<ref name="tperd"/><ref name="jimlu"/><ref name="jewolf">{{cite journal |last1=Wolfley |first1=Jeanette |title=Jim Crow, Indian Style: The Disenfranchisement of Native Americans |journal=Indian Law Review |date=1990 |volume=16 |issue=1 |pages=167–202 |url=http://health-equity.lib.umd.edu/567/1/JimCrowAIStyle.pdf |accessdate=27 November 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190412011616/http://health-equity.lib.umd.edu/567/1/JimCrowAIStyle.pdf |archive-date=April 12, 2019 |url-status=dead |doi=10.2307/20068694 |jstor=20068694 |hdl=1903/22633 }}</ref>

Jim Crow laws and Jim Crow state constitutional provisions mandated the segregation of public schools, public places, and public transportation, and the segregation of restrooms, restaurants, and drinking fountains between white and black people. [[Segregation in the United States Armed Forces|The U.S. military was already segregated]].

==Etymology==
The phrase "Jim Crow Law" can be found as early as 1892 in the title of a ''New York Times'' article about Louisiana requiring segregated railroad cars.<ref name=scjc7/><ref>{{cite news |url= https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9E05EEDB1F31E033A25752C2A9649D94639ED7CF |title=Louisiana's 'Jim Crow' Law Valid|quote=New Orleans, Dec 20. – The Supreme Court yesterday declared constitutional the law passed two years ago and known as the 'Jim Crow' law, making it compulsory on railroads to provide separate cars for black people.|work=The New York Times |date=December 21, 1892 |location=New York |issn=0362-4331 |accessdate=February 6, 2011}}</ref> The origin of the phrase "Jim Crow" has often been attributed to "[[Jump Jim Crow]]", a song-and-dance [[caricature]] of black people performed by white actor [[Thomas D. Rice]] in [[blackface]], which first surfaced in 1828 and was used to satirize [[Andrew Jackson]]'s populist policies. As a result of Rice's fame, "[[Jim Crow (character)|Jim Crow]]" by 1838 had become a pejorative expression meaning "Negro". When southern legislatures passed laws of racial segregation directed against [[black people]] at the end of the 19th century, these statutes became known as Jim Crow laws.<ref name=scjc7>Woodward, C. Vann and McFeely, William S. (2001), ''The Strange Career of Jim Crow''. p. 7</ref>

==Origins of Jim Crow laws==
{{Main|Disenfranchisement after the Reconstruction Era}}
In January 1865, an amendment to the Constitution to abolish slavery in the United States was proposed by Congress, and on December 18, 1865, it was ratified as the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]] formally abolishing slavery.<ref name="Jaynes2005">{{cite book|author=Gerald D.

During the [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]] period of 1865–1877, federal laws provided civil rights protections in the [[Southern United States|U.S. South]] for [[freedmen]], African Americans who had formerly been slaves, and the minority of black people who had been free before the war. In the 1870s, [[Southern Democrats|Democrats]] gradually regained power in the Southern legislatures,<ref name="Milewski2017">{{cite book|author=Melissa Milewski|title=Litigating Across the Color Line: Civil Cases Between Black and White Southerners from the End of Slavery to Civil Rights|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zXo7DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA47|date=1 November 2017|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-024919-9|pages=47–}}</ref> after having used [[insurgent]] [[paramilitary]] groups, such as the [[White League]] and the [[Red Shirts (Southern United States)|Red Shirts]], to disrupt Republican organizing, run Republican officeholders out of town, and intimidate black people to suppress their voting.<ref name="Perman2009">{{cite book|author=Michael Perman|title=Pursuit of Unity: A Political History of the American South|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jVHODYI1fNUC&pg=PA138|year=2009|publisher=Univ of North Carolina Press|isbn=978-0-8078-3324-7|pages=138–}}</ref> Extensive voter fraud was also used. In one instance, an outright coup or [[Wilmington insurrection of 1898|insurrection in coastal North Carolina]] led to the violent removal of democratically elected non-Democratic party executive and representative officials, who were either hunted down or hounded out. [[Gubernatorial]] elections were close and had been disputed in [[Louisiana]] for years, with increasing violence against black people during campaigns from 1868 onward.

In 1877, a [[Compromise of 1877|compromise]] to gain Southern support in the presidential election (a [[corrupt bargain]]) resulted in the government's withdrawing the last of the federal troops from the South. White Democrats had regained political power in every Southern state.<ref name=scjc6>Woodward, C. Vann, and McFeely, William S. ''The Strange Career of Jim Crow''. 2001, p.&nbsp;6.</ref> These Southern, white, Democratic [[Redeemers|Redeemer]] governments legislated Jim Crow laws, officially segregating black people from the white population. Jim Crow laws were a manifestation of [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] rule specifically directed at one racial group.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Parker|first1=Christopher Sebastian|last2=Towler|first2=Christopher C.|date=2019-05-11|title=Race and Authoritarianism in American Politics|url=https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-polisci-050317-064519|journal=Annual Review of Political Science|language=en|volume=22|issue=1|pages=503–519|doi=10.1146/annurev-polisci-050317-064519|issn=1094-2939|doi-access=free}}</ref>

Blacks were still elected to local offices throughout the 1880s in local areas with large black population, but their voting was suppressed for state and national elections. Democrats passed laws to make voter registration and electoral rules more restrictive, with the result that political participation by most black people and many poor white people began to decrease.<ref name="Michael Perman 2001">Michael Perman.''Struggle for Mastery: Disfranchisement in the South, 1888–1908''. Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 2001, Introduction.</ref><ref name="ReferenceA">J. Morgan Kousser.''The Shaping of Southern Politics: Suffrage Restriction and the Establishment of the One-Party South'', New Haven: Yale University Press, 1974.</ref> Between 1890 and 1910, ten of the eleven former [[Confederate States of America|Confederate states]], starting with [[Mississippi]], passed new constitutions or amendments that effectively [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disenfranchised]] most black people and tens of thousands of poor white people through a combination of [[poll tax (United States)|poll taxes]], [[literacy tests|literacy]] and comprehension tests, and residency and record-keeping requirements.<ref name="Michael Perman 2001"/><ref name="ReferenceA"/> [[Grandfather clause]]s temporarily permitted some illiterate white people to vote but gave no relief to most black people.

Voter turnout dropped drastically through the South as a result of such measures. In Louisiana, by 1900, black voters were reduced to 5,320 on the rolls, although they comprised the majority of the state's population. By 1910, only 730 black people were registered, less than 0.5% of eligible black men. "In 27 of the state's 60 parishes, not a single black voter was registered any longer; in 9 more parishes, only one black voter was."<ref name="Pildes"/> The cumulative effect in [[North Carolina]] meant that black voters were completely eliminated from voter rolls during the period from 1896 to 1904. The growth of their thriving middle class was slowed. In North Carolina and other Southern states, black people suffered from being made invisible in the political system: "[W]ithin a decade of disfranchisement, the [[white supremacy]] campaign had erased the image of the [[black middle class]] from the minds of white North Carolinians."<ref name="Pildes">Richard H.

Those who could not vote were not eligible to serve on juries and could not run for local offices. They effectively disappeared from political life, as they could not influence the state legislatures, and their interests were overlooked. While public schools had been established by Reconstruction legislatures for the first time in most Southern states, those for black children were consistently underfunded compared to schools for white children, even when considered within the strained finances of the postwar South where the decreasing price of cotton kept the agricultural economy at a low.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TUjFAAAAQBAJ&q=underfunded+jim+crow+schools&pg=PA145|title=History, Education, and the Schools|last=Reese|first=W.|date=2010-01-04|publisher=Springer|isbn=9780230104822|pages=145|language=en}}</ref>

Like schools, public libraries for black people were underfunded, if they existed at all, and they were often stocked with secondhand books and other resources.<ref name="jimlu"/><ref>Buddy, J., & Williams, M.

In [[Oklahoma]], for instance, anyone qualified to vote before 1866, or related to someone qualified to vote before 1866 (a kind of "[[grandfather clause]]"), was exempted from the literacy requirement''';''' but the only persons who had the franchise before that year were white, or European-American males.  European Americans were effectively exempted from the literacy testing, whereas black Americans were effectively singled out by the law.<ref>Tomlins, Christopher L.

[[Woodrow Wilson]] was a Democrat elected from New Jersey, but he was born and raised in the South, and was the first Southern-born president of the post-[[American Civil War|Civil War]] period. He appointed Southerners to his [[Cabinet of the United States|Cabinet]].  Some quickly began to press for segregated workplaces, although the city of Washington, D.C., and federal offices had been integrated since after the Civil War. In 1913, for instance, [[Secretary of the Treasury]] [[William Gibbs McAdoo]]&nbsp;– an appointee of the President&nbsp;– was heard to express his opinion of black and white women working together in one government office: "I feel sure that this must go against the grain of the white women. Is there any reason why the white women should not have only white women working across from them on the machines?"<ref>King, Desmond.

In sharp contrast to Wilson, a ''[[Washington Bee]]'' editorial wondered if the "reunion" of 1913 was a reunion of those who fought for "the extinction of slavery" or a reunion of those who fought to "perpetuate slavery and who are now employing every artifice and argument known to deceit" to present emancipation as a failed venture.<ref name=blight /> Historian [[David W.

In [[Texas]], several towns adopted residential segregation laws between 1910 and the 1920s. Legal strictures called for segregated water fountains and restrooms.<ref name=blight /> Jim Crow laws were a product of what had become the [[Solid South|solidly Democratic South]] due to the disfranchisement of black people.

== Historical development ==

===Early attempts to break Jim Crow===
[[File:JimCrowInDurhamNC.jpg|thumb|Sign for the "colored" waiting room at a bus station in [[Durham, North Carolina]], May 1940]]
The [[Civil Rights Act of 1875]], introduced by [[Charles Sumner]] and [[Benjamin F. Butler]], stipulated a guarantee that everyone, regardless of race, color, or previous condition of servitude, was entitled to the same treatment in public accommodations, such as inns, public transportation, theaters, and other places of recreation. This Act had little effect in practice.<ref>''New York Times'', 30 March 1882: 'COLORED METHODISTS INDIGNANT OVER THE EXPULSION OF THEIR SENIOR BISHOP FROM A FLORIDA RAILWAY CAR. : ... Colored men of spirit and culture are resisting the conductors, who attempt to drive them into the "Jim Crow cars," and they sometimes succeed ... '</ref> An 1883 Supreme Court decision ruled that the act was unconstitutional in some respects, saying Congress was not afforded control over private persons or corporations. With white southern Democrats forming a solid voting bloc in Congress, due to having outsize power from keeping seats apportioned for the total population in the South (although hundreds of thousands had been disenfranchised), Congress did not pass another civil rights law until 1957.<ref name="usgov">{{cite web|title=Constitutional Amendments and Major Civil Rights Acts of Congress Referenced in Black Americans in Congress|url=http://history.house.gov/Exhibitions-and-Publications/BAIC/Historical-Data/Constitutional-Amendments-and-Legislation/|website=History, Art & Archives|publisher=US House of Representatives|accessdate=27 January 2018}}</ref>

In 1887, [[William H. Heard (ambassador)|Rev. W. H. Heard]] lodged a complaint with the [[Interstate Commerce Commission]] against the [[Georgia Railroad and Banking Company|Georgia Railroad]] company for discrimination, citing its provision of different cars for white and black/colored passengers.  The company successfully appealed for relief on the grounds it offered "separate but equal" accommodation.<ref>''New York Times'', 30 July 1887: 'NO "JIM CROW" CARS. :"... The answer further avers that the cars provided for the colored passengers are equally as safe, comfortable, clean, well ventilated, and cared for as those provided for whites. The difference, it says, if any, relates to matters aesthetical only ..."</ref>

In 1890, Louisiana passed a law requiring separate accommodations for colored and white passengers on railroads. Louisiana law distinguished between "white", "black" and "colored" (that is, people of mixed European and African ancestry). The law had already specified that black people could not ride with white people, but colored people could ride with white people before 1890. A group of concerned black, colored and white citizens in [[New Orleans]] formed an association dedicated to rescinding the law. The group persuaded [[Homer Plessy]] to test it; he was a man of color who was of fair complexion and one-eighth "Negro" in ancestry.<ref name="lou">{{cite web|title=Plessy v. Ferguson|url=http://www.knowlouisiana.org/entry/plessy-v-ferguson|website=Know Louisiana|publisher=Louisiana Endowment for the Humanities|accessdate=27 January 2018}}</ref>

In 1892, Plessy bought a first-class ticket from New Orleans on the East Louisiana Railway. Once he had boarded the train, he informed the train conductor of his racial lineage and took a seat in the whites-only car. He was directed to leave that car and sit instead in the "coloreds only" car. Plessy refused and was immediately arrested. The Citizens Committee of New Orleans fought the case all the way to the United States Supreme Court.  They lost in ''[[Plessy v. Ferguson]]'' (1896), in which the Court ruled that "separate but equal" facilities were constitutional.  The finding contributed to 58 more years of legalized discrimination against black and colored people in the United States.<ref name="lou" />

In 1908 Congress defeated an attempt to introduce segregated streetcars into the capital.<ref>Congress rejected by a majority of 140 to 59 a transport bill amendment proposed by [[James Thomas Heflin]] (Ala.) to introduce racially segregated streetcars to the capital's transport system.

===Racism in the United States and defenses of Jim Crow===
[[File:JimCrowCar2.jpg|left|thumb|1904 caricature of "White" and "Jim Crow" rail cars by [[John T. McCutcheon]]. Despite Jim Crow's legal pretense that the races be "separate but equal" under the law, non-whites were given inferior facilities and treatment.<ref>John McCutheon. The Mysterious Stranger and Other Cartoons by John T. McCutcheon, New York, McClure, Phillips & Co. 1905.</ref>]]

White Southerners encountered problems in learning free labor management after the end of slavery, and they resented African Americans, who represented the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]]'s [[United States Civil War|Civil War]] defeat: "With [[white supremacy]] being challenged throughout the South, many whites sought to protect their former status by threatening African Americans who exercised their new rights."<ref>[[Henry Louis Gates|Gates, Henry Louis]] and [[Kwame Anthony Appiah|Appiah, Anthony]]. ''Africana: The Encyclopedia of the African and African American Experience''. 1999, p. 1211.</ref>  White Democrats used their power to segregate public spaces and facilities in law and reestablish social dominance over black people in the South.

One rationale for the systematic exclusion of African Americans from southern public society was that it was for their own protection. An early 20th-century scholar suggested that allowing black people to attend white schools would mean "constantly subjecting them to adverse feeling and opinion", which might lead to "a morbid race consciousness".<ref>Murphy, Edgar Gardner. ''The Problems of the Present South''. 1910, p. 37</ref> This perspective took anti-black sentiment for granted, because [[bigotry]] was widespread in the South after slavery became a racial [[caste]] system.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

===World War II and post-war era===

In 1944, [[Associate Justice]] [[Frank Murphy]] introduced the word "racism" into the lexicon of U.S. Supreme Court opinions in ''[[Korematsu v. United States]]'', [[Case citation|323 U.S. 214]] (1944).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&vol=323&invol=214 |title=Full text of Korematsu v. United States opinion |publisher=Findlaw}}</ref> He stated that by upholding the forced relocation of [[Japanese American]]s during World War II, the Court was sinking into "the ugly abyss of racism". This was the first time that "racism" was used in Supreme Court opinion (Murphy used it twice in a concurring opinion in ''[[Steele v Louisville & Nashville Railway Co]]'' [[Case citation|323 192]] (1944) issued that day).<ref>[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/cgi-bin/getcase.pl?court=us&vol=323&invol=192 Steele v. Louisville], Findlaw.</ref>  Murphy used the word in five separate opinions, but after he left the court, "racism" was not used again in an opinion for two decades.  It next appeared in the landmark decision of ''[[Loving v. Virginia]]'', {{ussc|388|1|1967}}.

Numerous boycotts and demonstrations against segregation had occurred throughout the 1930s and 1940s. The [[NAACP]] had been engaged in a series of litigation cases since the early 20th century in efforts to combat laws that disenfranchised black voters across the South. Some of the early demonstrations achieved positive results, strengthening political activism, especially in the post-World War II years. Black veterans were impatient with social oppression after having fought for the United States and freedom across the world. In 1947 [[K.

After World War II, people of color increasingly challenged segregation, as they believed they had more than earned the right to be treated as full citizens because of their military service and sacrifices.  The [[Civil Rights Movement]] was energized by a number of flashpoints, including the 1946 police beating and blinding of World War II veteran [[Isaac Woodard]] while he was in U.S. Army uniform. In 1948 President [[Harry S. Truman]] issued [[Executive Order 9981]], desegregating the armed services.<ref name="Truman9881">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8qS8gCz6gHAC&q=Executive%20Order%209981&pg=PA159|title=Freedom to Serve: Truman, Civil Rights, and Executive Order 9981|last=Taylor|first=Jon E.|pages=159|isbn=978-0-415-89449-4|date=2013-05-02}}</ref>

As the Civil Rights Movement gained momentum and used federal courts to attack Jim Crow statutes, the white-dominated governments of many of the southern states countered by passing alternative forms of restrictions.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

== Decline and removal ==
Historian [[William Chafe]] has explored the defensive techniques developed inside the African-American community to avoid the worst features of Jim Crow as expressed in the legal system, unbalanced economic power, and intimidation and psychological pressure. Chafe says "protective socialization by black people themselves" was created inside the community in order to accommodate white-imposed sanctions while subtly encouraging challenges to those sanctions. Known as "walking the tightrope," such efforts at bringing about change were only slightly effective before the 1920s.

However, this did build the foundation for later generations to advance racial equality and de-segregation. Chafe argued that the places essential for change to begin were institutions, particularly black churches, which functioned as centers for community-building and discussion of politics. Additionally, some all-black communities, such as Mound Bayou, Mississippi and Ruthville, Virginia served as sources of pride and inspiration for black society as a whole. Over time, pushback and open defiance of the oppressive existing laws grew, until it reached a boiling point in the aggressive, large-scale activism of the 1950s civil rights movement.<ref>William H.

===Integrating collegiate sports===
Racial integration of all-white collegiate sports teams was high on the Southern agenda in the 1950s and 1960s. Involved were issues of equality, racism, and the alumni demand for the top players needed to win high-profile games.  The [[Atlantic Coast Conference]] (ACC) of flagship state universities in the Southeast took the lead. First they started to schedule integrated teams from the North. Finally ACC schools--typically under pressure from boosters and civil rights groups--integrated their teams.<ref> Charles H. Martin, "The Rise and Fall of Jim Crow in Southern College Sports: The Case of the Atlantic Coast Conference." ''North Carolina Historical Review'' 76.3 (1999): 253-284. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/23522657 online]</ref>  With an alumni base that dominated local and state politics, society and business, the ACC schools were successful in their endeavor--as Pamela Grundy argues, they had learned how to win:
: The widespread admiration that athletic ability inspired would help transform athletic fields from grounds of symbolic play to forces for social change, places where a wide range of citizens could publicly and at times effectively challenge the assumptions that cast them as unworthy of full participation in U.S. society. While athletic successes would not rid society of prejudice or stereotype—black athletes would continue to confront racial slurs...[minority star players demonstrated] the discipline, intelligence, and poise to contend for position or influence in every arena of national life.<ref>Pamela Grundy, ''Learning to win: Sports, education, and social change in twentieth-century North Carolina'' (U of North Carolina Press, 2003) p 297[https://www.questia.com/read/101457616/learning-to-win-sports-education-and-social-change online]. </ref>

===Public arena===
In 1955, [[Rosa Parks]] refused to give up her seat on a city bus to a white man in [[Montgomery, Alabama]].  This was not the first time this happened — for example Parks was inspired by 15-year-old [[Claudette Colvin]] doing the same thing nine months earlier<ref>[https://www.democracynow.org/2013/3/29/the_other_rosa_parks_now_73 The Other Rosa Parks: Now 73, Claudette Colvin Was First to Refuse Giving Up Seat on Montgomery Bus]</ref> — but the Parks act of [[civil disobedience]] was chosen, symbolically, as an important catalyst in the growth of the [[Civil Rights Movement]]; activists built the [[Montgomery bus boycott]] around it, which lasted more than a year and resulted in desegregation of the privately run buses in the city. Civil rights protests and actions, together with legal challenges, resulted in a series of legislative and court decisions which contributed to undermining the Jim Crow system.<ref name="vcu">{{cite web|title=Jim Crow Laws and Racial Segregation|url=https://socialwelfare.library.vcu.edu/eras/civil-war-reconstruction/jim-crow-laws-and-racial-segregation/|website=VCU Libraries Social Welfare History Project|publisher=Virginia Commonwealth University|accessdate=27 January 2018}}</ref>

===End of legal segregation===
[[File:Lyndon Johnson signing Civil Rights Act, July 2, 1964.jpg|thumb|President Johnson signs the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]]]]

The decisive action ending segregation came when Congress in bipartisan fashion overcame Southern filibusters to pass the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] and the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]].  A complex interaction of factors came together unexpectedly in the period 1954–1965 to make the momentous changes possible. The Supreme Court had taken the first initiative in [[Brown v. Board of Education]] (1954) making segregation of public schools unconstitutional. Enforcement was rapid in the North and border states, but  was deliberately stopped in the South by the movement called [[Massive Resistance]], sponsored by rural segregationists who largely controlled the state legislatures. Southern liberals, who counseled moderation, were shouted down by both sides and had limited impact. Much more significant was the [[Civil Rights Movement]], especially the [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]] (SCLC) headed by [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]]. It largely displaced the old, much more moderate NAACP in taking leadership roles. King organized massive demonstrations, that seized massive media attention in an era when network television news was an innovative and universally watched phenomenon. <ref>Graham Allison, [https://www.amazon.com/Framing-South-Hollywood-Television-Struggle/dp/0801866154/ ''Framing the South: Hollywood, television, and race during the Civil Rights Struggle'' (2001).]</ref>  SCLC, student activists and smaller local organizations staged demonstrations across the South. National attention focused on Birmingham, Alabama, where protesters deliberately provoked [[Bull Connor]] and his police forces by using young teenagers as demonstrators – and Connor arrested  900 on one day alone. The next day Connor unleashed billy clubs, police dogs, and high-pressure water hoses to disperse and punish the young demonstrators with a brutality that horrified the nation. It was very bad for business, and for the image of a modernizing progressive urban South. President John F. Kennedy, who had been calling for moderation, threatened to use federal troops to restore order in Birmingham. The result in Birmingham was  compromise by which the new mayor opened the library, golf courses, and other city facilities to both races, against the backdrop of church bombings and assassinations. <ref>Diane McWhorter, ''Carry Me Home: Birmingham, Alabama: The Climactic Battle of the Civil Rights Revolution'' (2001) [https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780743217729 online free to borrow]</ref> In summer 1963, there were 800 demonstrations in 200 southern cities and towns, with over 100,000 participants, and 15,000 arrests. In Alabama  in June 1963 Governor [[George Wallace]] escalated the crisis by defying  court orders to admit the first two black students to the University of Alabama. <ref>Dan T. Carter,''The politics of rage: George Wallace, the origins of the new conservatism, and the transformation of American politics'' (LSU Press, 2000).</ref> Kennedy responded by sending Congress a comprehensive civil rights bill, and ordered Attorney General Robert Kennedy to file federal lawsuits against segregated schools, and to deny funds for discriminatory programs. Doctor King launched a massive march on Washington in August, 1963, bringing out 200,000 demonstrators  in front of the Lincoln Memorial, the largest political assembly in the nation's history. The Kennedy administration now gave full-fledged support to the civil rights movement, but powerful southern congressmen blocked any legislation. <ref>Robert E. Gilbert, "John F. Kennedy and civil rights for black Americans." ''Presidential Studies Quarterly'' 12.3 (1982): 386-399. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/27547837 Online] </ref> After Kennedy was assassinated President Lyndon Johnson called for immediate passage of Kennedy civil rights legislation as a memorial to the martyred president. Johnson formed a coalition with Northern Republicans that led to passage in the House, and with the help of Republican Senate leader [[Everett Dirksen]] with passage in the Senate early in 1964. For the first time in history, the southern filibuster was broken and The Senate finally passed its version on June 19 by vote of 73 to 27. <ref>Garth E. Pauley, "Presidential rhetoric and interest group politics: Lyndon B. Johnson and the Civil Rights Act of 1964." ''Southern Journal of Communication'' 63.1 (1997): 1-19.</ref> The Civil Rights Act of 1964 was the most powerful affirmation of equal rights ever made by Congress. It guaranteed access to public accommodations such as restaurants and places of amusement, authorized the Justice Department to bring suits to desegregate facilities in schools, gave new powers to the [[Civil Rights Commission]]; and allowed federal funds to be cut off in cases of discrimination. Furthermore, racial, religious and gender discrimination was outlawed for businesses with 25 or more employees, as well as apartment houses. The South resisted until the last moment, but as soon as the new law was signed by President Johnson on July 2, 1964, it was widely accepted across the nation. There was only a scattering of diehard opposition, typified by restaurant owner [[Lester Maddox]] in Georgia.<ref>Dewey W. Grantham, ''The South in Modern America '' (1994) 228-245.</ref>

In January 1964, President [[Lyndon Johnson]] met with civil rights leaders. On January 8, during his first [[State of the Union address]], Johnson asked Congress to "let this session of Congress be known as the session which did more for civil rights than the last hundred sessions combined." On June 21, civil rights workers [[Michael Schwerner]], [[Andrew Goodman (activist)|Andrew Goodman]], and [[James Chaney]] [[Murders of Chaney, Goodman, and Schwerner|disappeared]] in [[Neshoba County, Mississippi]], where they were volunteering in the registration of African-American voters as part of the [[Freedom Summer]] project. The disappearance of the three activists captured national attention and the ensuing outrage was used by Johnson and civil rights activists to build a coalition of northern and western Democrats and Republicans and push Congress to pass the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]].<ref name=cra64>{{cite web|url=http://finduslaw.com/civil_rights_act_of_1964_cra_title_vii_equal_employment_opportunities_42_us_code_chapter_21|title=Civil Rights Act of 1964 - CRA - Title VII - Equal Employment Opportunities - 42 US Code Chapter 21|access-date=October 2, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111229033506/http://finduslaw.com/civil_rights_act_of_1964_cra_title_vii_equal_employment_opportunities_42_us_code_chapter_21|archive-date=December 29, 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref>

United States]]'' 379 US 241 (1964).<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-30274716_ITM |author=Lopez, Ian F.

By 1965, efforts to break the grip of state disenfranchisement by education for voter registration in southern counties had been under way for some time, but had achieved only modest success overall. In some areas of the Deep South, white resistance made these efforts almost entirely ineffectual. The murder of the three voting-rights activists in Mississippi in 1964 and the state's refusal to prosecute the murderers, along with numerous other acts of violence and terrorism against black people, had gained national attention. Finally, the [[Selma to Montgomery marches#First Selma-to-Montgomery March|unprovoked attack on March 7, 1965]], by county and state troopers on peaceful Alabama marchers crossing the [[Edmund Pettus Bridge]] en route from Selma to the state capital of [[Montgomery, Alabama|Montgomery]], persuaded the President and Congress to overcome Southern legislators' resistance to effective voting rights enforcement legislation. President Johnson issued a call for a strong voting rights law and hearings soon began on the bill that would become the Voting Rights Act.<ref>[http://www.usdoj.gov/crt/voting/intro/intro_b.htm "Introduction To Federal Voting Rights Laws"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070304111738/http://www.usdoj.gov/crt/voting/intro/intro_b.htm |date=March 4, 2007 }}. United States Department of Justice.</ref>

The [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]] ended legally sanctioned state barriers to voting for all federal, state and local elections. It also provided for federal oversight and monitoring of counties with historically low minority voter turnout. Years of enforcement have been needed to overcome resistance, and additional legal challenges have been made in the courts to ensure the ability of voters to elect candidates of their choice. For instance, many cities and counties introduced [[at-large]] election of council members, which resulted in many cases of diluting minority votes and preventing election of minority-supported candidates.<ref> Patterson, '' Brown v. Board of Education: A Civil Rights Milestone and Its Troubled Legacy'' (2002)</ref>

In 2013, the [[Shelby_County_v._Holder | Roberts Court ]] removed the requirement established by the Voting Rights Act that Southern states needed Federal approval for changes in voting policies.  Several states immediately made changes in their laws restricting voting access. <ref>Vann R Newkirk II,  ''How Shelby County v. Holder Broke America'' https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2018/07/how-shelby-county-broke-america/564707/ (2018)</ref>

== Influence and aftermath ==
=== African-American life ===
[[File:ColoredDrinking.jpg|thumb|An African-American man drinking at a "colored" drinking fountain in a streetcar terminal in [[Oklahoma City]], Oklahoma, 1939]]

The Jim Crow laws and the high rate of [[lynching]]s in the South were major factors which led to [[Great Migration (African American)|the Great Migration]] during the first half of the 20th century. Because opportunities were so limited in the South, African Americans moved in great numbers to cities in Northeastern, Midwestern, and Western states to seek better lives.

Despite the hardship and prejudice of the Jim Crow era, several black entertainers and literary figures gained broad popularity with white audiences in the early 20th century. They included luminaries such as tap dancers [[Bill "Bojangles" Robinson]] and the [[Nicholas Brothers]], jazz musicians such as [[Louis Armstrong]], [[Duke Ellington]] and [[Count Basie]], and the actress [[Hattie McDaniel]]. In 1939 McDaniel was the first black person to receive an [[Academy Award]] when she won the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] Oscar for her performance as Mammy in ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]''.<ref>{{cite news |last=Lewis |first=Hilary |date=2016-02-27 |title=Oscars: A Look Back at the African-American Winners

African-American athletes faced much discrimination during the Jim Crow period. White opposition led to their exclusion from most organized sporting competitions. The boxers [[Jack Johnson (boxer)|Jack Johnson]] and [[Joe Louis]] (both of whom became [[world heavyweight boxing championship|world heavyweight boxing champions]]) and track and field athlete [[Jesse Owens]] (who won four gold medals at the [[1936 Summer Olympics]] in Berlin) earned fame during this era. In baseball, a [[baseball color line|color line]] instituted in the 1880s had informally barred black people from playing in the [[Major League Baseball|major leagues]], leading to the development of the [[Negro league baseball|Negro Leagues]], which featured many fine players. A major breakthrough occurred in 1947, when [[Jackie Robinson]] was hired as the first African American to play in Major League Baseball; he permanently broke the color bar. Baseball teams continued to integrate in the following years, leading to the full participation of black baseball players in the Major Leagues in the 1960s.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}
=== Interracial marriage ===
{{main|Anti-miscegenation laws in the United States}}
{{see also|Interracial marriage in the United States}}

Although sometimes counted among "Jim Crow laws" of the South, statutes such as [[Anti-miscegenation laws in the United States|anti-miscegenation laws]] were also passed by other states. Anti-miscegenation laws were not repealed by the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]], but were declared [[unconstitutional]] by the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] (the [[Warren Court]]) in a unanimous ruling ''[[Loving v. Virginia]] (1967)''.<ref name=cra64/><ref>{{Cite book|title=Interracialism black-white intermarriage in American history, literature, and law|last=Sollers|first=Werner|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2000|isbn=1-280-65507-0|location=New York; Oxford|pages=26–34}}</ref><ref name=":3">{{Cite web|url=https://www.oyez.org/cases/1966/395|title=Loving v.

=== Jury trials ===
The [[Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] required individuals on criminal convictions to be tried by a jury of their peers. While federal law required that convictions could only granted from a unanimous jury vote for federal crimes, states were free to decide on this process for themselves. All but two states, Oregon and Louisiana, had opted for the same unanimous jury conviction requirements. Both Oregon and Louisiana allowed jury votes of at least 10–2 to decide a criminal conviction. Louisiana's law was eventually changed to require unanimous jury votes for criminal convictions for crimes after 2019, but before that point, the law was seen as a remnant of Jim Crow laws, since it allowed minority voices on a jury to be marginalized. In 2020, the Supreme Court found in ''[[Ramos v. Louisiana]]'' that unanimous jury votes are required for criminal convictions at state levels, nullifying Oregon's remaining law and overturning previous cases in Louisiana.<ref name="vox">{{cite news |last1=Lopez |first1=German |title=Louisiana votes to eliminate Jim Crow jury law with Amendment 2 |url=https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/11/6/18052540/election-results-louisiana-amendment-2-unanimous-jim-crow-jury-law |accessdate=20 April 2020 |work=Vox |date=6 November 2018 |language=en}}</ref>

=== Later court cases ===

In 1971, the U.S. Supreme Court (the [[Burger Court]]), in ''[[Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education]]'', upheld [[desegregation busing]] of students to achieve integration.

Interpretation of the Constitution and its application to minority rights continues to be controversial as Court membership changes. Observers such as Ian F. Lopez believe that in the 2000s, the Supreme Court has become more protective of the status quo.<ref>Lopez, Ian F.
