In doubles, Stosur (formerly ranked No. 1) partnered [[Rennae Stubbs]], ranked No. 5 at the time; however, the pair were unseeded because the ITF determined the seedings for the doubles competition based on both singles and doubles rankings standings. The pair lost in the second round to the Spanish team of [[Anabel Medina Garrigues]] and [[Virginia Ruano Pascual]], who were then ranked No. 2.

At the [[2008 US Open (tennis)|US Open]], Stosur lost in the first round of singles to seventh seed Venus Williams.

At the same tournament, Stosur and Stubbs defeated Black and Huber in the semifinals but lost to [[Nuria Llagostera Vives]] and [[María José Martínez Sánchez]] in the final. With these results, Stosur improved her ranking to a career-high No. 15 in singles just in time for the [[2009 US Open – Women's Singles|US Open]], where she was seeded accordingly. She opened with a three-set win over Ai Sugiyama before losing to American wildcard [[Vania King]] in the second round. Stosur entered the [[2009 US Open – Women's Doubles|doubles event]] with compatriot Stubbs. As the third seeds, they made the semifinals without dropping a set, where they faced first seeds Black and Huber. They won the first set, but lost the next two after a two-day rain interruption.

At the [[2009 Toray Pan Pacific Open|Pan Pacific Open]], Stosur won her opening round over [[Alexa Glatch]] but was defeated by [[Maria Sharapova]] in the second round with Sharapova dropping just one game. Seeded 15th at the [[2009 China Open (tennis)|China Open]], Stosur lost a three-setter to Alizé Cornet. Stosur then played in [[2009 HP Open|Osaka]] as the third seed. Stosur reached final after defeating [[Alexandra Panova]], [[Akiko Morigami]], [[Jill Craybas]] and Wozniacki.

She also qualified for the [[2009 WTA Tour Championships – Doubles|doubles event]], partnering compatriot Stubbs. They lost a hard-fought semifinals match against No. 1 seeds Black and Huber. Stosur was one of only two players on tour who played at both year-end championships. The other one was María José Martínez Sánchez, who was in Stosur's group at Bali for the round-robin stage with [[Ágnes Szávay]]. Stosur won her first match against Szávay in three sets but lost her second to Martínez Sánchez. This loss cost her the semifinals spot, as Martínez Sánchez won both her round-robin matches.

===2010: World's top ten and first singles Grand Slam final===
{{BLP sources section|date=March 2016}}
Alongside [[Lleyton Hewitt]], Stosur represented Australia at the [[2010 Hopman Cup|Hopman Cup]]. The Australians were the top seeds. Their first tie was against Romania, where Stosur lost to Sorana Cîrstea in a three-setter, and then lost in the mixed doubles. The next tie was against the US, where Stosur beat [[Melanie Oudin]] in straight sets. Hewitt also won his singles match against [[John Isner]], sealing the tie. In mixed doubles, Hewitt-Stosur lost. To advance to the final, Australia needed to win their tie against Spain 3–0. This result was, however, reversed, Australia losing to Spain 0–3. Stosur's last preparation tournament prior to the Australian Open was the [[2010 Medibank International Sydney|Medibank International]] where she lost to Flavia Pennetta in the first round. Stosur was guaranteed a seeding of 13 for the [[2010 Australian Open|Australian Open]]. She lost against world No. 1 and defending champion, Serena Williams, in two sets. Despite the loss, she moved up to a career-high ranking of No. 11. She played with Nadia Petrova in the doubles event of the [[2010 Australian Open – Women's Doubles|Australian Open]]. They were seeded fifth, but lost to another Russia-Australian duo, [[Vera Dushevina]] and [[Anastasia Rodionova]] in the first round. She then travelled to Adelaide to represent Australia at the [[2010 Fed Cup World Group II|Fed Cup]] alongside Alicia Molik, Casey Dellacqua and Rennae Stubbs against Spain. Stosur won both of her singles matches by beating María José Martínez Sánchez and Anabel Medina Garrigues. Stosur and Stubbs also won their doubles match, gifting Australia a 3–2 win in the tie.

Her next tournament was the Dubai Championships where she was seeded ninth. Stosur was defeated in the opening round, at the hands of veteran [[Tathiana Garbin]]. She had better success in the doubles partnering Petrova. The pair was seeded fourth and reached the semifinals after receiving a first-round bye, then a walkover, and a win against fifth seeds [[Alisa Kleybanova]] and Francesca Schiavone. Seeded eighth at the BNP Paribas Open, Stosur received a first-round bye. In the quarterfinals, she defeated 12th seed and defending champion Vera Zvonareva, to move through to her first semifinal at the tournament, where she lost to eventual champion [[Jelena Janković]] in straight sets, with Stosur making 47 unforced errors in the match. With her success, she reached a career-high ranking of No. 10, making her only the third Australian woman to achieve this feat in ten years, after Jelena Dokić reached No. 4 in 2002 and Alicia Molik reached No. 8 in 2005. In doubles, Stosur was third seed with Petrova. They had a comfortable route to the final, dropping only one set, where they lost to Květa Peschke and Katarina Srebotnik. Stosur's next tournament was the [[2010 Sony Ericsson Open|Miami Masters]], where she was seeded ninth which allowed her a bye in the first round. She lost in the quarterfinals to eventual champion [[Kim Clijsters]]. In the doubles draw, Stosur and Petrova were seeded third and reached the final without dropping a set. However, Stosur and Petrova were defeated in the second straight final, losing in a super-tiebreak 7–10 to [[Gisela Dulko]] and Pennetta.

[[File:Samantha Stosur, Round 1, Roland Garros, 2010.jpg|thumb|left|Stosur reached her first singles Grand Slam final at Roland Garros]]
Stosur began her clay-court season at the [[2010 Family Circle Cup|Family Circle Cup]], where she was seeded fourth. In the final, she defeated Zvonareva in straight sets, for her fifth consecutive victory over the Russian. With this, she won her second and biggest WTA title, which put her back inside the top ten at world No. 10. She is the only Australian woman to have won this title. Stosur competed in the [[2010 Fed Cup World Group Play-offs|World Group Play-offs]] in Ukraine. After the first day, the Aussies had a commanding lead, going 2–0 against Ukraine. This was helped by a win from Stosur against [[Mariya Koryttseva]], and Anastasia Rodionova's win over [[Alona Bondarenko]]. Stosur then secured victory for Australia with a two-sets win over [[Lyudmyla Kichenok]]. Because of this, Australia played in the [[2011 Fed Cup|World Group]] in 2011 against the top-seed [[Italy Fed Cup team|Italy]]. Stosur then competed at the [[2010 Porsche Tennis Grand Prix|Porsche Grand Prix]] in Stuttgart. Her 11-game winning streak was ended by former world No. 1, Justine Henin, in the final in three sets. Despite this result, Stosur reached a new career-high ranking of world No. 8.

Her next scheduled tournament was the [[2010 Internazionali BNL d'Italia|Rome Masters]]; however, Stosur had to withdraw due to fatigue. With this, her next scheduled tournament was the [[2010 Mutua Madrileña Madrid Open|Madrid Open]]. In the quarterfinals, Stosur was broken multiple times by Venus Williams, losing 3–6, 3–6. In doubles, Stosur resumed her partnership with Petrova as third seeds with a first-round bye. However, they were knocked out in the second round by Anastasia Rodionova and Patty Schnyder. Coming into the [[2010 French Open|French Open]], Stosur was seeded seventh and was one of the favourites to win the title, due to her semifinal run in 2009 and her tour-best 14–2 record on clay in 2010. She was drawn in the same quarter as Henin, Maria Sharapova and Serena Williams, which was dubbed the toughest section of the draw. Becoming the first Australian woman to reach a Grand Slam singles final since [[Wendy Turnbull]] at the 1980 Australian Open, she was the favourite for the title, by dispatching three consecutive former world No. 1s and favorites for the title Henin, Serena Williams and Jelena Janković) but was upset by Francesca Schiavone in the final.

In doubles, Stosur and her partner Petrova were the fourth seeds. They defeated [[Irina Pavlovic]] and Laura Thorpe in the first round, and [[Vania King]] and [[Michaëlla Krajicek]] in the second round. Their run came to an end at the hands of Ukrainian sisters [[Alona Bondarenko]] and [[Kateryna Bondarenko]], when the fourth seeds retired trailing 1–6, 0–1. At the Aegon International in Eastbourne, Stosur was defeated in the semifinal by eventual champion [[Ekaterina Makarova]], despite leading the first set 3–0 and having a chance to serve for that set at 5–3. But with her semifinals appearance she attained a new career high of world No. 6; also, she was ranked No. 1 in the race to the WTA Championships in Doha. Her next tournament was the [[2010 Wimbledon Championships|Wimbledon Championships]]. As the sixth seed, Stosur fell in the first round to [[Kaia Kanepi]] in straight sets, after saving three match points. As the [[2010 French Open|French Open]] champion Schiavone also lost in the first round, Stosur and Schiavone were the first two women in history who reached the French Open final, but failed to win a match at Wimbledon. Despite not winning a match, she received a new career-high ranking of world No. 5, due to Dementieva's withdrawal from the tournament due to injury. Stosur also played in the doubles event, hoping to have success similar to the previous year with then-partner Stubbs. She played with her 2010 partner Petrova as the third seeds, but lost in the third round to eventual champions, Vania King and Yaroslava Shvedova. She also competed in the mixed doubles event as first seeds with [[Nenad Zimonjić]]. They received a bye in the first round, and in the second round, they defeated [[Colin Fleming]] and [[Sarah Borwell]]. They then faced the Belgium duo [[Xavier Malisse]] and Clijsters, but lost in two sets.

[[File:Samantha Stosur at the 2010 US Open 07.jpg|thumb|right|175px|Stosur at the 2010 US Open]]
Stosur's next scheduled tournament was the [[2010 Bank of the West Classic|Bank of the West Classic]] in Stanford, where she was the top-seed, but lost in a semifinal match-up with Victoria Azarenka. She then participated in the [[2010 Mercury Insurance Open|Mercury Insurance Open]] in San Diego. As the second seed, she lost in the quarterfinals to Pennetta. Due to a shoulder injury, she withdrew from the [[2010 Western & Southern Financial Group Masters and Women's Open|Cincinnati Open]] and the [[2010 Rogers Cup|Rogers Cup]] in Montreal. This meant that Stosur had only taken part in one of the five Premier-5 tournaments of the year. After taking time off to recover from her injury, she took part in the [[2010 Pilot Pen Tennis|Pilot Pen Tennis]] tournament at New Haven, in hopes of regaining some of the lost ranking points and in preparation for the US Open. Stosur lost to Petrova in the quarterfinals. At the [[2010 US Open (tennis)|US Open]], Stosur was seeded fifth. In her first US Open quarterfinal, she was up a break in the third set, before falling to defending champion and second seed Clijsters in three sets. Stosur announced that she would not take part in the 2010 Commonwealth Games. Instead, she competed at the final Premier Mandatory event of the year, the [[2010 China Open (tennis)|China Open]], where she lost in the first round to qualifier [[Anastasija Sevastova]] in three sets. Stosur qualified in singles for the year-ending [[2010 WTA Tour Championships|WTA Championships]] in Doha for the first time in her career, following the withdrawal of Venus Williams.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sonyericssonwtatour.com/news/20101006/schiavone-stosur-qualify-for-doha_2256076_2177109 |title=WTA &#124; News &#124; Latest News &#124; Schiavone & Stosur Qualify For Doha |publisher=Sonyericssonwtatour.com |accessdate=28 January 2012}}</ref>

Stosur then attempted to defend her title at the [[2010 HP Open|HP Open]] as the top-seed, her only International tournament of the year. She lost against [[Kimiko Date-Krumm]] in the quarterfinals in a final-set tie-break, becoming the first top-ten player in WTA history to lose to an opponent over the age of 40. Stosur competed at the WTA Championships, where she was seeded fifth. Stosur was drawn in the Maroon Group alongside world No. 1, Caroline Wozniacki, world No. 6, Francesca Schiavone, and world No. 9, Elena Dementieva, seeded first, fourth and seventh, respectively, due to the Williams sisters' withdrawal. In her first match against Schiavone, she avenged her Roland Garros final loss to the Italian by defeating her in straight sets, coming back from a 0–4 deficit in the first set. Her next opponent was world No. 1, Wozniacki. Stosur continued her dominant showing, recording a straight-sets win to secure her spot in the semifinals. She then fell to Elena Dementieva, but secured her spot in the semifinals by winning one set. Stosur finished in first position in her round-robin group, but lost to three-time US Open champion and world No. 4, Clijsters, in the semifinals. Stosur ended her year ranked No. 6. In addition, she was the only player in 2010 to defeat both current world No. 1 players, Serena Williams and Wozniacki. She also had the best percentage of points scored on second serve amongst her peers.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

Stosur suffered two second-round losses at the [[2011 Toray Pan Pacific Open|Pan Pacific Open]] and the [[2011 China Open (tennis)|China Open]], both to Maria Kirilenko.

In addition, Stosur has won six of her last seven matches against current top-2 players. (The only loss against a current top-2 player at that time was against world No. 1, Serena Williams, in the 2010 Australian Open.)

They reached the quarterfinals together, but lost to crowd favorites [[Andy Murray]] and [[Laura Robson]], who were competing for Great Britain.

At the [[2012 Western & Southern Open|Western & Southern Open]] in Cincinnati, Stosur entered the tournament as the third seed. Stosur had a bye in the first round, and she played Anabel Medina Garrigues in the second round winning in three sets. She played [[Ekaterina Makarova]] in the second round, comfortably prevailing in two sets. In the quarterfinals, Stosur played wildcard and former world No. 1, Venus Williams, who won in three sets. Defending a [[2011 US Open – Women's Singles|Grand Slam title]] for the first time, Stosur comfortably made it through the first three rounds at the [[2012 US Open – Women's Singles|US Open]] against Petra Martić, [[Edina Gallovits-Hall]], and 31st seed Varvara Lepchenko. Stosur only lost 13 games in the first three rounds. She was then up against rising star Laura Robson. Robson had defeated Kim Clijsters and Li Na en route to the fourth round. Stosur comfortably defeated Robson in straight sets but lost in the quarterfinals to world No. 1, Victoria Azarenka, in a thrilling three-set showdown, which is regarded as the match of the championships. She succumbed seven points to five in the final-set tiebreaker and was two points away from clinching victory. It was the first time Stosur had ever taken a set of Azarenka. Despite not defending the title, Stosur did win the inaugural US Open Sportsmanship Award.

Her next tournament was the [[2012 Toray Pan Pacific Open – Singles|Pan Pacific Open]]. As the eighth seed, Stosur had a bye in the first round, and played Francesca Schiavone in the second round, winning in a three-set battle. She defeated 12th seed Dominika Cibulková in the third round in two sets. In the quarterfinals, she beat world No. 2, Maria Sharapova, in straight sets, causing a huge upset—considering Stosur had only beaten Sharapova once in eleven matches. However, Stosur lost the semifinal to former doubles partner and eventual champion Petrova, in straight sets.

===2013: Struggles with form===
She started her year at the [[2013 Brisbane International – Women's Singles|Brisbane International]] where she was seeded seventh.

But it is Stosur who has won their most important match, the [[2011 US Open (tennis)|2011 US Open]] final; she prevailed 6–2, 6–3 even if Williams went into the match as the clear favorite. That match had its share of controversy when Williams was docked a point for violating the hindrance rule. Williams avenged the defeat at the 2012 Miami Masters, 7–5, 6–3. They next met a week later at the [[2012 Family Circle Cup]], where Williams again defeated Stosur 6–1, 6–1.

Both players have held match points against the other in matches that they have gone on to lose. Examples include Stosur having four match points at the [[2009 Medibank International Sydney]], but eventually losing. Another example was the [[2010 French Open]] where Williams had a match point, but Stosur won.

The only time they didn't play a complete match was at the [[2011 Western & Southern Open]] in the second round where Williams withdrew from the match due to a toe injury.

===Stosur v Schiavone===
Currently, Stosur leads 9–4 in head-to-head matches. Their important matches include the 2009 final of [[2009 HP Open|HP Open]] in Osaka, where Stosur lifted her first WTA singles title, and the [[2010 French Open]] final. It was both players' first ever Grand Slam final, with Schiavone coming out on top.

===Stosur v Zvonareva===
Currently, Stosur leads 8–2 in their head-to-head matches. Zvonareva won their first two meetings. After that, Stosur has won the following eight matches, including the [[2010 Family Circle Cup]] final and the [[2011 US Open (tennis)|2011 US Open]] quarterfinal match.

===Stosur v Sharapova===
Maria Sharapova leads 15–2 in their head-to-head matches. Sharapova won their first nine meetings, prevailing in straight sets at their most recent meeting at the 2015 French Open. Sharapova retired in 2020.

===Stosur v Li===
Stosur leads 6–1 in head-to-head matches. Stosur won the first six meetings, five of them being in straight sets, including an overwhelming 6–1, 6–0 victory against [[Li Na (tennis)|Li Na]] at the [[WTA Finals|WTA Championships]] in 2011. [[Li Na]] then retired in 2014.

===Stosur v Šafářová===
Šafářová leads their head-to-head 11–4. Their first meeting was in Charleston, when Šafářová won 5–7, 6–1, 6–4. After next two Šafářová's wins, Stosur won their fourth match in Miami and then again in Dubai. After that Šafářová won two times in two tie-breaks, in Montreal and in Ostrava during [[2013 Fed Cup]] competition. Šafářová beat Stosur even three-times in 2013, in Eastbourne, Tokyo in the third round and following week in Beijing in the first round. In 2014, they met in Charleston third round, where Šafářová won again, but in 2015, Stosur won in Sydney in three sets, but Šafářová got revenge in Doha.
They met again in 2016 in the final in Prague, which Šafářová won in three sets. Stosur then beat her at the [[2016 French Open]] in three sets.

==Coaching==
Stosur has had several coaches through the years. David Taylor coached her from 2008 to 2013 and 2015 to 2016, and [[Miles Maclagan]] was her coach in 2013 and 2014. Others include Simon Rea (2014–2015) and [[Joshua Eagle]] (2017–2018).<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.tennisworldusa.org/tennis/news/WTA_Tennis/62602/sam-stosur-part-ways-with-josh-eagle-after-two-years/ | title=Sam Stosur part ways with Josh Eagle after two years | accessdate=8 December 2018}}</ref> In November 2018 Stosur began working with Nick Watkins.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.tennis.com/pro-game/2018/11/stosur-reunites-childhood-coach-aims-rebuild-singles-ranking/78204/ | title=Stosur reunites with childhood coach | accessdate=8 December 2018}}</ref> In 2019 she began working with [[Rennae Stubbs]].
