The '''price of oil''', or the '''oil price''', generally refers to the [[spot price]] of a [[Oil barrel|barrel]] of [[benchmark crude oil]]—a reference price for buyers and sellers of crude oil such as [[West Texas Intermediate]] (WTI), [[Brent Crude]], [[Dubai Crude]], [[OPEC Reference Basket]], [[Tapis crude]], [[Bonny Light]], [[Urals oil]], [[Isthmus-34 Light|Isthmus]] and [[Western Canadian Select]] (WCS).<ref name="Benchmarks_2011">{{citation |title=International Crude Oil Market Handbook |date=2011 |work= Energy Intelligence Group }}</ref><ref name="pricingdifferences">{{cite web |url=http://tonto.eia.doe.gov/ask/crude_types1.html |title=Pricing Differences Among Various Types of Crude Oil |access-date=17 February 2008 |work=EIA |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101113164128/http://tonto.eia.doe.gov/ask/crude_types1.html |archive-date=13 November 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref> There is a differential in the price of a barrel of oil based on its grade—determined by factors such as its specific gravity or [[API gravity]] and its sulfur content—and its location—for example, its proximity to [[tidewater (marketing)|tidewater]] and refineries. Heavier, [[sour crude oil]]s lacking in tidewater access—such as Western Canadian Select—are less expensive than lighter, [[Sweet crude oil|sweeter oil]]—such as WTI.

The price of oil rose dramatically from US$50 in early 2007, to a peak of US$147 in July 2008, before plunging to US$34 in December 2008, as the [[financial crisis of 2007–2008]] took hold.<ref name="AB_Evans_2009"/>{{rp|46}}

According to a January 2020 EIA report, the average price of Brent crude oil in 2019 was $64 per barrel compared to $71 per barrel in 2018.

The substantial decrease in the price of oil was caused by two main factors: the [[2020 Russia–Saudi Arabia oil price war]]<ref name="Kellogg"/> and the [[COVID-19 pandemic]], which lowered demand for oil because of lockdowns around the world.<ref name="Kellogg"/> In the fall of 2020, against the backdrop of the resurgent pandemic, the [[U.S. Energy Information Administration]] (EIA) reported that global oil inventories remained "quite high" while demand for gasoline—particularly in the United States—was "particularly worrisome."<ref name="Bloomberg_Rigzone_20201021"/> The price of oil was about US$40 by mid-October.<ref name="BNNbloomberg_20201017"/>

==Analyses of oil price fluctuations ==
[[File:El Saharara oil field, Libya.jpg|thumb|Weekly reports on crude oil inventories or total stockpiles in storage facilities like these tanks have a strong bearing on oil prices]]
Global oil prices are determined by the forces of [[supply and demand]],<ref name="IEA_20040614">{{cite web|url=http://www.iea.org/Textbase/Papers/2004/High_Oil_Prices.pdf|title=Publications|access-date=5 January 2015 |date= June 14, 2005}}</ref> according to the classical economic model of price determination in microeconomics. The demand for oil is highly dependent on global macroeconomic conditions.<ref name="IEA_20040614"/> According to the [[International Energy Agency]], high oil prices generally have a large negative impact on global [[economic growth]].<ref name="IEA_20040614"/> 

In response to the 1973 oil crisis, in 1974, the [[RAND Corporation]] presented a new economic model of the global oil market that included four sectors—"crude production, transportation, refining, and consumption of products" and these regions—United States, Canada, Latin America, Europe, the Middle East and Africa, and Asia.<ref name="RAND_Kennedy_1974">{{Cite journal| doi = 10.2307/3003120| issn = 0005-8556| volume = 5| issue = 2| pages = 540| last = Kennedy| first = Michael| title = An Economic Model of the World Oil Market| journal = The Bell Journal of Economics and Management Science| access-date = 27 October 2020| date = 1974| url = https://www.jstor.org/stable/3003120?origin=crossref| jstor = 3003120}}</ref> The study listed exogenous variables that can affect the price of oil: "regional supply and demand equations, the technology of refining, and government policy variables". Based on these exogenous variables, their proposed economic model would be able to determine the "levels of consumption, production, and price for each commodity in each region, the pattern of world trade flows, and the refinery capital structure and output in each region".<ref name="RAND_Kennedy_1974"/>

A system dynamics economic model of oil price determination "integrates various factors affecting" the dynamics of the price of oil, according to a 1992 ''[[European Journal of Operational Research]]'' article.<ref name="Morecroft_19920526">{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1016/0377-2217(92)90009-X| issn = 0377-2217| volume = 59| issue = 1| pages = 102–122| last1 = Morecroft| first1 = John D.

A widely cited 2008 ''[[The Review of Economics and Statistics]]'', article by Lutz Killian, examined the extent to which "exogenous oil supply shocks"—such as  the Iranian revolution (1978/79), Iran-Iraq War (1980-1988), Persian Gulf War (1990/91), Iraq War (2003), Civil unrest in Venezuela (2002/03), and perhaps the Yom Kippur War/Arab oil embargo (1973/74)"—explain changes in the price of oil."<ref name="Kilian_200080418">{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1162/rest.90.2.216| issn = 0034-6535| volume = 90| issue = 2| pages = 216–240| last = Kilian| first = Lutz| title = Exogenous Oil Supply Shocks: How Big Are They and How Much Do They Matter for the U.S. Economy?| journal = The Review of Economics and Statistics| access-date = 27 October 2020| date = 18 April 2008| url = https://doi.org/10.1162/rest.90.2.216}}</ref> Killian stated that, by 2008, there was "widespread recognition" that "oil prices since 1973 must be considered endogenous with respect to global macroeconomic conditions,"<ref name="Kilian_200080418"/> but Kilian added that these "standard theoretical models of the transmission of oil price shocks that maintain that everything else remains fixed, as the real price of imported crude oil increases, are misleading and must be replaced by models that allow for the endogenous determination of the price of oil."

In a 2014 ''[[Journal of International Money and Finance]]'' article, Lutz said described different types of shocks that affected the real price of oil—shocks to the "flow supply of oil", to the "flow demand for crude oil that reflect the state of the global business cycle," and to the "speculative demand for oil stocks above the ground", and "on other more idiosyncratic oil demand shocks".<ref name="JIMF_Lutz_201404">{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1016/j.jimonfin.2013.08.005| issn = 02615606| volume = 42| pages = 71–87| last1 = Kilian| first1 = Lutz| last2 = Lee| first2 = Thomas K.| title = Quantifying the speculative component in the real price of oil: The role of global oil inventories| journal = Journal of International Money and Finance| access-date = 27 October 2020| date = April 2014| url = https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0261560613001071}}</ref> In this article he examined how one of the challenges for researchers was to identify problems and quantify "speculative oil demand shocks."<ref name="JIMF_Lutz_201404"/>

By 2016, despite improved understanding of oil markets, predicting oil price fluctuations remained a challenge for economists, according to a 2016 article in the ''Journal of Economic Perspectives'' , which was based on an extensive review of academic literature by economists on "all major oil price fluctuations between 1973 and 2014".<ref name="JEP_Baumeister_20160101">{{Cite journal|title = Forty Years of Oil Price Fluctuations: Why the Price of Oil May Still Surprise Us|journal = The Journal of Economic Perspectives|date = 1 January 2016|pages = 139–160|volume = 30|issue = 1|doi = 10.1257/jep.30.1.139|first = Christiane|last = Baumeister|first2 = Lutz|last2 = Kilian|doi-access = free}}</ref>

In North America the benchmark price refers to the [[spot price]] of [[West Texas Intermediate]] (WTI), also known as Texas Light Sweet, a type of crude oil used as a benchmark in oil pricing and the underlying commodity of New York Mercantile Exchange's oil futures contracts. WTI is a light [[crude oil]], lighter than [[Brent Crude]] oil. It contains about 0.24% sulfur, rating it a sweet crude, sweeter than Brent.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://rbnenergy.com/the-cost-of-crude-at-cushing-wti-and-the-cma|title=The Cost Of Crude At Cushing – WTI And The NYMEX CMA|access-date=5 April 2020}}</ref> Its properties and production site make it ideal for being refined in the United States, mostly in the Midwest and Gulf Coast regions.

In Europe and some other parts of the world, the price of the oil benchmark is [[Brent Crude]] as traded on the [[Intercontinental Exchange]] (ICE, into which the [[International Petroleum Exchange]] has been incorporated) for delivery at [[Sullom Voe]]. Brent oil is produced in coastal waters ([[North Sea]]) of UK and Norway.

==Oil-storage trade (contango)==
{{main|Oil-storage trade}}
[[File:Bateaux comparaison3.png|thumb|upright=1.8|The [[Seawise Giant|Knock Nevis]] (1979–2010), a ULCC supertanker compared to the longest ships ever built]]

The oil-storage trade, also referred to as contango, a market strategy in which large, often vertically-integrated oil companies purchase oil for immediate delivery and storage—when the price of oil is low— and hold it in storage until the price of oil increases. Investors bet on the future of oil prices through a [[financial instrument]], [[oil futures]] in which they agree on a contract basis, to buy or sell oil at a set date in the future. Crude oil is stored in salt mines, tanks and oil tankers.<ref name="oil_glut" />

Investors can choose to take profits or losses prior to the oil-delivery date arrives. Or they can leave the contract in place and physical oil is "delivered on the set date" to an "officially designated delivery point", in the United States, that is usually [[Cushing, Oklahoma|Cushing]], Oklahoma. When delivery dates approach, they close out existing contracts and sell new ones for future delivery of the same oil. The oil never moves out of storage. If the forward market is in "[[contango]]"—the [[forward price]] is higher than the current [[spot price]]—the strategy is very successful.

Scandinavian Tank Storage AB and its founder Lars Jacobsson introduced the concept on the market in early 1990.<ref name="Yglesias_2014">{{citation |title=Why speculators are stashing vast quantities of crude oil on tanker ships |first=Matthew |last=Yglesias |date=25 December 2014 |access-date=21 January 2015 |url=https://www.vox.com/2014/12/25/7443569/contango-oil-storage |work=[[Vox (website)|VOX]]}}</ref> But it was in 2007 through 2009 the oil storage trade expanded,<ref name=NPR>{{cite web|first=Michele|last=Norris|date=17 December 2008|title=Contango In Oil Markets Explained|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=98410267}}</ref> with many participants—including [[Wall Street]] giants, such as [[Morgan Stanley]], [[Goldman Sachs]], and [[Citicorp]]—turning sizeable profits simply by sitting on tanks of oil.<ref name=WSJ6oct2007>{{cite news|title=Where Has All The Oil Gone?

By the end of October 2009 one in twelve of the largest oil tankers was being used more for temporary storage of oil, rather than transportation.<ref name=FT2009>{{cite journal|date=17 November 2009|title=Tankers store oil as futures prices rocket|first=Robert |last=Wright|journal=Financial Times|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/29a6663e-d3af-11de-8caf-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2QV1AuRl4|location=London, UK}}</ref>

From June 2014 to January 2015, as the price of oil dropped 60% and the supply of oil remained high, the world's largest traders in crude oil purchased at least 25 million barrels to store in supertankers to make a profit in the future when prices rise. [[Trafigura]], [[Vitol]], [[Gunvor (company)|Gunvor]], [[Koch Industries|Koch]], [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]] and other major energy companies began to book oil storage supertankers for up to 12 months. By 13 January 2015 At least 11 [[Oil tanker#Size categories|Very Large Crude Carriers (VLCC) and Ultra Large Crude Carriers (ULCC)]]" have been reported as booked with storage options, rising from around five vessels at the end of last week.

In 2015 as global capacity for oil storage was out-paced by global oil production, and an oil glut occurred. Crude oil storage space became a [[tradable commodity]] with [[CME Group]]— which owns [[NYMEX]]— offering [[oil-storage futures]] contracts in March 2015.<ref name="oil_glut" /> Traders and producers can buy and sell the right to store certain types of oil.<ref>{{citation |title= LOOP Sour Crude Oil Storage futures |url=https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/energy/files/loop-storage-futures-wdm-fact-card.pdf |access-date=3 May 2020 }}</ref><ref>{{citation |title= Permian WTI Storage Future |url=https://www.theice.com/products/71090497/Permian-WTI-Storage-Future |access-date=3 May 2020 }}</ref>

By 5 March 2015, as oil production outpaces oil demand by 1.5 million bpd, storage capacity globally is dwindling.<ref name="oil_glut" /> In the United States alone, according to data from the [[Energy Information Administration]], U.S. crude-oil supplies are at almost 70% of the U.

==Future projections==
{{Main|Oil depletion|Peak oil}}
Peak oil is the period when the maximum rate of global [[petroleum]] [[extraction of petroleum|extraction]] is reached, after which the rate of production enters terminal decline. It relates to a long-term decline in the available supply of petroleum.  This, combined with increasing demand, will significantly increase the worldwide prices of petroleum derived products. Most significant will be the availability and price of liquid fuel for transportation.<ref name="journal"/>

The US Department of Energy in the [[Hirsch report]] indicates that "The problems associated with world oil production peaking will not be temporary, and past "energy crisis" experience will provide relatively little guidance."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.netl.doe.gov/publications/others/pdf/Oil_Peaking_NETL.pdf|title=DOE Hirsch Report|website=doe.gov|access-date=25 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091215043338/http://www.netl.doe.gov/publications/others/pdf/Oil_Peaking_NETL.pdf|archive-date=15 December 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The macroeconomics impact on lower oil prices is lower inflation. A lower inflation rate is good for the consumers. This means that the general price of a basket of goods would increase at a bare minimum on a year to year basis. Consumer can benefit as they would have a better purchasing power, which may improve real gdp.<ref name="auto">{{cite web|last1=Pettinger|first1=Tevjan|title=Impact of falling oil prices|url=https://www.economicshelp.org/blog/11738/oil/impact-of-falling-oil-prices/|website=Economics Org|access-date=5 October 2017}}</ref> However, in recent countries like Japan, the decrease in oil prices may cause deflation and it shows that consumers are not willing to spend even though the prices of goods are decreasing yearly, which indirectly increases the real debt burden.<ref name="auto"/> Declining oil prices may boost consumer oriented stocks but may hurt oil-based stocks.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/102054596|title=What the impact of plunging oil prices really means|first=Alex|last=Rosenberg|date=5 October 2014|website=cnbc.com|access-date=25 March 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/goldman-consumer-stocks-to-benefit-from-low-oil-prices-2014-11|title=Goldman Consumer Stocks To Benefit From Low Oil Prices—Business Insider|date=17 November 2014|work=Business Insider|access-date=17 October 2015}}</ref> It is estimated that 17–18% of S&P would decline with declining oil prices.

It has also been argued that the collapse in oil prices in 2015 should be very beneficial for developed western economies, who are generally oil importers and aren't over exposed to declining demand from China.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://seekingalpha.com/article/3845256-opportunity-decline-oil-price |title=Opportunity From The Decline In Oil Price |first=Edward Pearce |last=Gould|date=28 January 2016 |website=seekingalpha.com|access-date= 25 March 2018}}</ref> In the Asia-Pacific region, exports and economic growth were at significant risk across economies reliant on commodity exports as an engine of growth. The most vulnerable economies were those with a high dependence on fuel and mineral exports to China, such as: Korea DPR, Mongolia and Turkmenistan—where primary commodity exports account for 59–99% of total exports and more than 50% of total exports are destined to China. The decline in China's demand for commodities also adversely affected the growth of exports and GDP of large commodity-exporting economies such as Australia (minerals) and the Russian Federation (fuel). On the other hand, lower commodity prices led to an improvement in the trade balance—through lower the cost of raw materials and fuels—across commodity importing economies, particularly Cambodia, Kyrgyzstan, Nepal and other remote island nations (Kiribati, Maldives, Micronesia (F.S), Samoa, Tonga, and Tuvalu) which are highly dependent on fuel and agricultural imports.<ref>{{citation |ssrn=2617542 |date= 2015|title= Commodity Price Crash: Risks to Exports and Economic Growth in Asia-Pacific LDCs and LLDCs |publisher=United Nations ESCAP |author1=Saggu, A. |author2=Anukoonwattaka, W. |name-list-style=amp }}</ref>

It shows the GDP increase between 0.5% to 1.0% for India, USA and China, and a decline of greater than 3.5% from Saudi Arabia and Russia. A stable price of $60 would add 0.5 percentage point to global gross domestic product.

Katina Stefanova has argued that falling oil prices do not imply a recession and a decline in stock prices.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/katinastefanova/2014/12/31/do-falling-oil-prices-foreshadow-a-slump-in-the-stock-market-in-2015/|title=Do Falling Oil Prices Foreshadow a Slump in the Stock Market in 2015?|first=Katina|last=Stefanova|work=Forbes|access-date=17 October 2015}}</ref> Liz Ann Sonders, Chief Investment Strategist at Charles Schwab, had earlier written that  that  positive impact on consumers and businesses outside of the energy sector, which is a larger portion of the US economy will outweigh the negatives.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.schwab.com/public/schwab/nn/articles/Black-Dog-Are-Plunging-Oil-Prices-a-Positive-or-a-Negative|title=Black Dog: Are Plunging Oil Prices a Positive or a Negative?, Liz Ann Sonders, November 3, 2014|website=schwab.com|access-date=25 March 2018|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141220084048/http://www.schwab.com/public/schwab/nn/articles/Black-Dog-Are-Plunging-Oil-Prices-a-Positive-or-a-Negative|archive-date=20 December 2014}}</ref>

While President Trump said in 2018, that the lower price of oil was like a "big Tax Cut for America and the World",<ref name="CNN_Egan_2018121"/> ''[[The Economist]]'' said that rising oil prices had a negative impact on oil-importing countries in terms of international trade.<ref name="economist_20180929_oil"/> Import prices rise in relation to their exports.<ref name="economist_20180929_oil"/> The importing country's [[Current account (balance of payments)|current account]] deficits widen because "their exports pay for fewer imports".<ref name="economist_20180929_oil"/>

==Speculative trading and crude oil futures==
In the wake of the 1970s oil crisis, speculative trading in crude oil and crude oil futures in the [[commodity market]]s emerged.<ref name="Qiang_201307"/><ref name="Ji_Qiang_201312"/>

NYMEX launched crude oil futures contracts in 1983, and the IPE launched theirs in  June 1988.<ref name="Petroleum Science_Tian_20191201"/> Global crude oil prices began to be published through NYMEX and IPE  crude oil futures market.<ref name="Petroleum Science_Tian_20191201"/> Volatility in crude oil prices can cause problems for the global economy. These crude oil futures contracts helped mitigate the "economic hazards of international crude oil spot price fluctuations".<ref name="Petroleum Science_Tian_20191201"/> By 2019, NYMEX and ICE had become "representative of the world crude oil futures market"—an important factor in the world economy.<ref name="Petroleum Science_Tian_20191201"/> Crude oil futures bring some uncertainty to the market and contribute to crude oil price fluctuations. <ref name="Petroleum Science_Tian_20191201"/> 

By 2008, there were a number of widely traded oil futures market listings.<ref name="Bloomberg_2008">{{cite news |url= https://www.bloomberg.com/markets/commodities/energyprices.html|title= Bloomberg Energy Prices|access-date=11 June 2008|publisher= Bloomberg.com}}</ref>

===Speculation during the 2007-2008 financial crisis===
According to a U.S. [[Commodity Futures Trading Commission]] (CFTC) 29 May 2008 report the "Multiple Energy Market Initiatives" was launched in partnership with the United Kingdom [[Financial Services Authority]] and [[IntercontinentalExchange|ICE Futures Europe]] in order to expand surveillance and information sharing of various futures contracts.  Part 1 is "Expanded International Surveillance Information for Crude Oil Trading."<ref name=CFTC_2008 />  This announcement received wide coverage in the financial press, with speculation about oil futures price manipulation.<ref name="ftgateway_2008" /><ref name="washingtonpost_2008" /><ref name="money_2008" /> In June 2008 ''Business Week'' reported that the surge in oil prices prior to the financial crisis of 2008 had led some commentators to argue that at least some of the rise was due to [[speculation]] in the [[Futures exchange|futures markets]].<ref name=Wallace2008 /> The July 2008 interim report by the Interagency Task Force found that found that [[speculation]] had not caused significant changes in oil prices and that the [[Oil price increases since 2003|increase in oil prices]] between January 2003 and June 2008 [were] largely due to fundamental supply and demand factors."<ref name="ITF_200807">{{Cite journal| pages = 48| title = Interim Report on Crude Oil |work=Interagency Task Force on Commodity Markets |location=Washington, D.C. |url=https://www.cftc.gov/sites/default/files/idc/groups/public/@newsroom/documents/file/itfinterimreportoncrudeoil0708.pdf |date= July 2008 |access-date=27 October 2020}}</ref>{{rp|3}}  The report found that the primary reason for the price increases was that the [[world economy]] had [[economic expansion|expanded]] at its fastest pace in decades, resulting in substantial increases in the demand for oil, while the [[oil production]] grew sluggishly, compounded by production shortfalls in oil-exporting countries.<ref name="ITF_200807"/>{{rp|3}}

The report stated that as a result of the imbalance and low [[price elasticity]], very large price increases occurred as the [[Market (economics)|market]] attempted to balance scarce [[price elasticity of supply|supply]] against growing [[price elasticity of demand|demand]], particularly from 2005 to 2008.<ref name="ITF_200807"/>{{rp|14}} The report forecast that this imbalance would persist in the future,<ref name="ITF_200807"/>{{rp|4}} leading to continued upward pressure on oil prices, and that large or rapid movements in oil prices are likely to occur even in the absence of activity by speculators.<ref name="ITF_200807"/>{{rp|4}} 

===Hedging using oil derivatives===
The use of [[hedge (finance)|hedging]] using commodity [[derivative (finance)|derivative]]s as a risk management tool on price exposure to liquidity and earnings, has been long established in North America. Chief Financial Officers (CFOS) use derivatives to dampen, remove or mitigate price uncertainty.<ref name="ogfj_2012">{{cite web | url=http://www.ogfj.com/articles/print/volume-9/issue-11/features/etrm/hedging-is-an-effective-risk-management.html | title=Hedging Is An Effective Risk Management Tool For Upstream Companies | publisher=Oil and Gas Financial Journal | date=1 November 2012 | access-date=17 February 2016 | author=Price, Kevin | location=London}}</ref> Bankers also use hedge funds to more "safely increase leverage to smaller oil and gas companies."<ref name="ogfj_2012" /> However, when not properly used, "derivatives can multiply losses"<ref name="ogfj_2012" /> particularly in North America where investors are more comfortable with higher levels of risk than in other countries.<ref name="ogfj_2012" />

With the large number of bankruptcies as reported by Deloitte<ref name="fortune_2016">{{cite magazine | url=http://fortune.com/2016/02/16/oil-companies-bankrupt/ | title=One-Third of Oil Companies Could Go Bankrupt this Year | magazine=Fortune | date=16 February 2016 | access-date=17 February 2016 | author=Zillman, Claire}}</ref> "funding [for upstream oil industry] is shrinking and hedges are unwinding."<ref name="G&M_Deloitte_2016" /> "Some oil producers are also choosing to liquidate hedges for a quick infusion of cash, a risky bet."<ref name="reuters_2016_Feb16" />

According to John England, the Vice-Chairman Deloitte LLP, "Access to capital markets, bankers' support and derivatives protection, which helped smooth an otherwise rocky road, are fast waning...The roughly 175 companies at risk of bankruptcy have more than $150 billion in debt, with the slipping value of secondary stock offerings and asset sales further hindering their ability to generate cash."<ref>{{citation |first=John |last=England |work=Deloitte LLP |title=Statement |date=16 February 2016}}</ref>

To finance exploration and production of the unconventional oil industry in the United States, "hundreds of billions of dollars of capital came from non-bank participants [non-bank buyers of bank energy credits] in leveraged loans] that were thought at the time to be low risk.<ref name="ft_2015">{{cite news | url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/5bb59df2-9808-11e4-b4be-00144feabdc0.html#axzz40SbjUYQ2 | title=Lesson from history on perils facing oil and gas investors | newspaper=Financial Times | date=9 January 2015 | access-date=17 February 2016 | author=Dizard, John}}</ref> However, with the oil glut that continued into 2016, about a third of oil companies are facing bankruptcy.<ref name="fortune_2016"/> While investors were aware that there was a risk that the operator might declare bankruptcy, they felt protected because "they had come in at the 'bank' level, where there was a senior claim on the assets [and] they could get their capital returned."<ref name="ogfj_2012" />

According to a 2012 article in ''Oil and Gas Financial Journal'', "the combination of the development of large resource plays in the US and the emergence of business models designed to ensure consistent dividend payouts to investors has led to the development of more aggressive hedging policies in companies and less restrictive covenants in bank loans."<ref name="ogfj_2012" />

===Institutional investors divesting from oil industry===
At the fifth annual World Pensions Forum in 2015, [[Jeffrey Sachs]] advised [[institutional investor]]s to divest from carbon-reliant [[oil industry]] firms in their [[pension fund]]'s portfolio.<ref name="Sachs_2015">{{cite news|first1=Andrew |last1=Pearce|title= Jeffrey Sachs: Fund Managers Have a Duty to Dump Fossil Fuels|url=http://www.efinancialnews.com/story/2015-12-07/sachs222 |access-date=30 December 2015|work=Financial News|date=6 December 2015}}</ref>
