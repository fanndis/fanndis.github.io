'''Regency Enterprises''' (commonly referred to as '''Regency''' onscreen and credited as '''Regency Enterprises (USA), Inc.''' (in the U. S.) and '''Monarchy Enterprises S.á.r.l.''' (overseas)) is an American entertainment company formed by [[Arnon Milchan]]. It was founded in 1982 as the successor to '''Regency International Pictures''' formerly known as '''Embassy International Pictures N.V.'''.

== History ==
=== Origins (1982–1991) ===
Arnon Milchan founded his company as Embassy International Pictures N.V. which held the name for 7 years until the named changed to Regency International Pictures. This company originally had no distribution deal producing films with various studios such as [[The Ladd Company]], [[Columbia Pictures]], [[TriStar Pictures]], [[Warner Bros.]], [[Touchstone Pictures]], [[Vestron Pictures]], [[Universal Pictures]] and [[20th Century Fox]]. This company produced films such as ''[[Once Upon a Time in America]]'' and ''[[Q&A (film)|Q&A]]''. This company was shut down in 1991.

=== Regency Enterprises and New Regency Branding (1991–present) ===
Arnon Milchan rebranded Regency International Pictures and renamed it to Regency Enterprises. In addition to signing a distribution deal with Warner Bros., a subsidiary company '''New Regency Productions''' was also created.<ref>''Billboard'' (September 3, 2005), page 85.</ref> Formerly with offices on the Warner Bros. lot, New Regency is currently located on the [[20th Century Studios]] lot. New Regency primarily produces movies, and has at least 100 movies to its credit. New Regency produced 2013's ''[[12 Years a Slave (film)|12 Years a Slave]]'', 2014's ''[[Birdman (film)|Birdman]]'', and 2015's ''[[The Revenant (2015 film)|The Revenant]]'', which earned the company two [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Academy Awards for Best Picture]] in a row, and three nominations.

Founder Arnon Milchan's daughter Alexandra Milchan headed their offshoot "Regency Vision," originally intended as a competitor to companies like [[New Line Cinema]]'s Fine Line Features, a "specialty features" division.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thewrap.com/alexandra-milchan-exits-new-regency-post-signs-first-look-deal-company-exclusive/|title=Alexandra Milchan Exits New Regency Post, Signs First-Look Deal with Company (Exclusive)|date=2013-11-06}}</ref>

In 1999, New Regency executive David Matalon joined the supervisory board of Puma AG, an international sports company. At the time, Regency was the largest single shareholder in Puma, with more than a 25% stake.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/1999/biz/news/puma-picks-pic-pair-1117492614/ |title=Puma picks pic pair |date=1999-03-24|work=Variety }}</ref>  Arnon Milchan also owned Puma stock, which he later sold for $676 million in May 2003.<ref>Los Angeles Magazine, May 2003</ref>

In September 1997, Milchan signed a 15-year distribution pact with [[20th Century Fox]] (now [[20th Century Studios]]) worldwide in all media outside of foreign television rights, ending a previous association with [[Warner Bros.]] (1991–1999). Fox's parent company [[News Corporation (1980–2013)|News Corporation]] (now [[Walt Disney Studios (division)|Walt Disney Studios]]) funneled $200 million in New Regency, in exchange for a 20% stake in the company.<ref name="Eller" /> In 2011, Fox and New Regency extended the pact, to expire in 2022.<ref name="Jan2011">{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2011/01/fox-to-distribute-new-regency-thru-2022-97400/|title=Fox To Distribute New Regency Thru 2022|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|first=Nikki|last=Finke|date=January 17, 2011}}</ref>
