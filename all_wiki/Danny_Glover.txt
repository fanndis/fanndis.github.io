==Career==
[[file:Danny Glover 1997.jpg|thumb|upright|Glover in 1997]]
Glover originally worked in city administration working on community development{{citation needed|date=April 2011}} before transitioning to theater. He has said:

<blockquote>I didn't think it was a difficult transition. Acting is a platform that can become a conveyer for ideas. Art is a way of understanding, of confronting issues and confronting your own feelings—all within that realm of the capacity it represents. It may have been a leap of faith for me, given not only my learning disability ([[dyslexia]]) but also the fact that I felt awkward. I felt all the things that someone that's 6′3″ or 6′4″ feels and with my own diminished expectations of who I could be [and] would feel. Whether it's art, acting or theater that I've devoted myself to I put more passion and more energy into it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abilitymagazine.com/glover_interview.html|work=[[Ability (magazine)|Ability Magazine]] | title=Actor and Activist, Danny Glover|access-date=April 6, 2012}}</ref></blockquote>

His first theater involvement was with the ''American Conservatory Theater'', a regional training program in San Francisco.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.act-sf.org/content/dam/act/pressreleases/ACT%20Season%20Gala%202015%20Announcement%20Release_FINAL.pdf |title=COME GET STRANDED! |publisher=American Conservatory Theater |access-date=August 7, 2017}}</ref> Glover also trained with Jean Shelton at the [[Shelton Studios|Shelton Actors Lab]] in San Francisco. In an interview on ''[[Inside the Actors Studio]]'', Glover credited Jean Shelton for much of his development as an actor. Deciding that he wanted to be an actor, Glover resigned from his city administration job and soon began his career as a stage actor. Glover then moved to Los Angeles for more opportunities in acting, where he would later go on to co-found the [[Robey Theatre Company]] with actor [[Ben Guillory]] in honor of the actor and concert singer [[Paul Robeson]] in Los Angeles in 1994.{{citation needed|date=April 2011}}

Glover has had a variety of film, stage, and television roles, and is best known for playing Los Angeles police Sergeant [[Roger Murtaugh]] in the ''[[Lethal Weapon]]'' series of action films, starring alongside [[Mel Gibson]], and [[Joe Pesci]]. Later he once again starred with [[Gary Busey]] in the blockbuster ''[[Predator 2]]''. He also starred as the husband to [[Whoopi Goldberg]]'s character Celie in the celebrated literary adaptation ''[[The Color Purple (film)|The Color Purple]]'', and as Lieutenant James McFee in the film ''[[Witness (1985 film)|Witness]]''. In 1994 he made his directorial debut with the [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] channel short film ''[[Override (film)|Override]]''.

Also in 1994, Glover and actor [[Ben Guillory]] founded the [[Robey Theatre Company]] in Los Angeles, focusing on theatre by and about black people. During his career, he has made several cameos, appearing, for example, in the [[Michael Jackson]] video "[[Liberian Girl]]" of 1987. Glover earned top billing for the first time in ''[[Predator 2]]'', the sequel to the [[science fiction]] action film ''[[Predator (film)|Predator]]''. That same year he starred in [[Charles Burnett (director)|Charles Burnett]]'s ''[[To Sleep with Anger]]'', for which he won the [[Independent Spirit Award for Best Male Lead]].

In common with [[Humphrey Bogart]], [[Elliott Gould]], and [[Robert Mitchum]], who have played [[Raymond Chandler]]'s private eye detective [[Philip Marlowe]], Glover played the role in the episode "Red Wind" of the Showtime network's 1995 series ''[[Fallen Angels (American TV series)|Fallen Angels]]''. In 1997, under his former production company banner Carrie Films, Glover executive produced numerous films of first time directors including Pamm Malveaux's ''[[neo-noir]]'' short film ''Final Act starring Joe Morton'', which aired on the [[Independent Film Channel]]. In addition, Glover has been a voice actor in many children's movies. Glover was featured in the popular 2001 film ''[[The Royal Tenenbaums]]'', also starring [[Gwyneth Paltrow]], [[Anjelica Huston]], [[Ben Stiller]], and [[Owen Wilson]].

In 2004, he appeared in the low-budget horror film ''[[Saw (2004 film)|Saw]]'' as [[Detective David Tapp]]. In 2005, Glover and Joslyn Barnes announced plans to make ''No FEAR'',<ref>{{IMDb title|1846984|No Fear}}</ref> a film about Dr. [[Marsha Coleman-Adebayo]]'s experience. Coleman-Adebayo won a 2000 jury trial against the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)]]. The jury found the EPA guilty of violating the civil rights of Coleman-Adebayo on the basis of race, sex, color and a hostile work environment, under the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]]. Coleman-Adebayo was terminated shortly after she revealed the environmental and human disaster taking place in the [[Brits, North West|Brits, South Africa]], [[vanadium]] mines. Her experience inspired passage of the Notification and Federal Employee Anti-discrimination and Retaliation Act of 2002 ([[No-FEAR Act]]). {{As of|2013}} the ''No Fear'' title has not appeared but ''The Marsha Coleman-Adebayo Story'' was announced as the next major project of No Fear Media Productions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marshacoleman-adebayo.com/no-fear-the-film.html|title=Coming Soon to a Theater Near You: The Marsha Coleman-Adebayo Story|publisher=Marsha Coleman-Adebayo|access-date=February 25, 2013}}</ref> 

Glover portrayed David Keaton in the film ''[[The Exonerated]]''—a real-life story of Keaton's experience of being arrested, jailed and then freed from death row.

In 2009, Glover performed in ''[[The People Speak (film)|The People Speak]]'', a documentary feature film that uses dramatic and musical performances of the letters, diaries, and speeches of everyday Americans, based on historian [[Howard Zinn]]'s ''[[A People's History of the United States]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thepeoplespeak.com/pages/credits/ |title=Bringing History to Life &#124; Voices of a People's History in the US |website=Thepeoplespeak.com |access-date=July 31, 2016 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100713025528/http://www.thepeoplespeak.com/pages/credits/ |archive-date=July 13, 2010 |df=mdy}}</ref>

Glover played President Wilson, the President of the United States in ''[[2012 (film)|2012]]'', a disaster film directed by [[Roland Emmerich]] and released in theaters November 13, 2009. In 2010, Glover participated in a Spanish film called ''[[I Want to Be a Soldier]]''. In 2012, he starred in the film ''[[Donovan's Echo]]''.

Glover co-starred in the science fiction comedy film ''[[Sorry to Bother You (film)|Sorry to Bother You]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2017/07/sorry-to-bother-you-movie-danny-glover-david-cross-patton-oswalt-boots-riley-1202136106/|title=Danny Glover, David Cross and Patton Oswalt Join 'Sorry to Bother You'|last=Busch|first=Anita|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|date= July 26, 2017|access-date=May 19, 2018}}</ref> which was released in theaters on July 6, 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/news/watch-lakeith-stanfield-in-wild-sorry-to-bother-you-trailer-w520411|title=Watch Lakeith Stanfield Make Millions With 'White Voice' in Wild 'Sorry to Bother You' Trailer|last=Blistein|first=Jon|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|date= May 17, 2018|access-date=May 19, 2018}}</ref>

===Planned directorial debut===
{{outdated section|date=August 2019}}
Glover sought to make a film biography of [[Toussaint Louverture]] for his directorial debut. In May 2006, the film had included cast members [[Wesley Snipes]], [[Angela Bassett]], [[Don Cheadle]], [[Jonathan Rhys Meyers]], [[Chiwetel Ejiofor]], [[Roger Guenveur Smith]], [[Mos Def]], [[Isaach de Bankolé]], and [[Richard Bohringer]].

While attending [[San Francisco State University]] (SFSU), Glover was a member of the Black Students' Union,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sfsu.edu/~news/prsrelea/fy98/069.htm |title=Actor and activist Danny Glover to be honored by San Francisco State University |publisher=Sfsu.edu |access-date=October 25, 2008}}</ref> which, along with the Third World Liberation Front and the [[American Federation of Teachers]], collaborated in a five-month student-led strike to establish a Department of [[Black Studies]].

Hari Dillon, current president of the [[Vanguard Public Foundation]], was a fellow striker at SFSU. Glover later co-chaired Vanguard's board. He is also a board member of the [[Algebra Project]], the Black AIDS Institute, Walden House and [[Cheryl Byron]]'s ''Something Positive Dance Group''.

In 1999, he used his leverage as a former San Francisco cab driver to raise awareness about African Americans being passed over for white passengers. In response, Rudolph Giuliani launched Operation Refusal, which suspended the licenses of cab drivers who favored white passengers over black ones.

Glover's long history of union activism includes support for the [[United Farm Workers]], [[UNITE HERE]], and numerous service unions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20080124/glover_trespass_080124/20080124?hub=Entertainment|title=Danny Glover convicted of trespassing in Ontario|website=Ctv.ca|access-date=July 31, 2016|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216125531/http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20080124/glover_trespass_080124/20080124?hub=Entertainment|archive-date=December 16, 2008|df=mdy-all}}</ref> In March 2010, Glover supported 375 Union workers in Ohio by calling upon all actors at the 2010 Academy Awards to boycott [[Hugo Boss]] suits following announcement of Hugo Boss's decision to close a manufacturing plant in Ohio after a proposed pay decrease from $13 to $8.30 an hour was rejected by the Workers United Union.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=124399061|title=NPR}}</ref>

On the foreign policy of the Obama administration, Glover said: "I think the Obama administration has followed the same playbook, to a large extent, almost verbatim, as the Bush administration. I don't see anything different... On the domestic side, look here: What's so clear is that this country from the outset is projecting the interests of wealth and property. Look at the bailout of Wall Street. Why not the bailout of Main Street? He may be just a different face, and that face may happen to be black, and if it were [[Hillary Clinton]], it would happen to be a woman.... But what choices do they have within the structure?"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://newsone.com/nation/news-one-staff/danny-glover-i-see-no-difference-between-bush-and-obama-policies|title=Danny Glover: I See No Difference Between Bush And Obama Policies|publisher=News One}}</ref>

====Caribbean and Haiti====
On January 13, 2010, Glover compared the scale and devastation of the [[2010 Haiti earthquake]] to the predicament other island nations may face as a result of the failed [[2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference|Copenhagen summit]] the previous year. Glover said: "the threat of what happens to Haiti is a threat that can happen anywhere in the Caribbean to these island nations&nbsp;... they're all in peril because of global warming&nbsp;... because of climate change&nbsp;... when we did what we did at the climate summit in Copenhagen, this is the response, this is what happens".<ref>{{cite web|date=January 13, 2010 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2ft5JkNWJA |title=GRITtv: Danny Glover and Marie St. Cyr on Haiti |publisher=YouTube |access-date=August 7, 2017}}</ref> In the same statement, he called for a new form of international partnership with Haiti and other Caribbean nations and praised Venezuela, Brazil, and Cuba, for already accepting this partnership.

====Iraq War====
Danny Glover had been an outspoken critic of the Iraq War before the war began in March 2003. In February 2003, he was one of the featured speakers at [[Justin Herman Plaza]] in San Francisco where other notable speakers included names such as author [[Alice Walker]], singer [[Joan Baez]], [[United Farm Workers]] co-founder [[Dolores Huerta]] and Rep. [[Barbara Lee]], D-Oakland.
Glover was a signatory to the April 2003 anti-war letter "To the Conscience of the World" that criticized the unilateral American invasion of Iraq that led to "massive loss of civilian life" and "devastation of one of the cultural patrimonies of humanity".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.solidarity-us.org/current/node/615 |title=Archived copy |access-date=May 25, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100627221148/http://www.solidarity-us.org/current/node/615 |archive-date=June 27, 2010 |df=mdy}}</ref>
During an anti-war demonstration in Downtown Oakland in March 2003, Glover praised the community leaders for their anti-war efforts saying that "They're on the front lines because they are trying to make a better America.&nbsp;... The world has come together and said 'no' to this war – and we must stand with them."

====Venezuela====
In January 2006, [[Harry Belafonte]] led a delegation of activists, including Glover and activist/professor [[Cornel West]], in a meeting with [[President of Venezuela]] [[Hugo Chávez]]. In 2006, Glover had begun working on a film about [[Toussaint Louverture]], who led the 18th century revolt in Haiti and, it was reported, that Chavez supported the film, "hoping the historical epic will sprinkle Hollywood stardust on his effort to mobilise world public opinion against imperialism and western oppression."<ref name="GUARDIAN">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/may/21/film.venezuela|title=Venezuela giving Danny Glover $18m to direct film on epic slave revolt|date=May 20, 2007|agency=[[The Guardian]]|last1=Carroll|first1=Rory|access-date=August 22, 2015}}</ref><ref name=NYDAILYNEWS>{{cite news|last1=Prensa|first1=Asociada|title=Danny Glover recibe nuevo crédito en Venezuela|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/latino/danny-glover-recibe-nuevo-credito-en-venezuela-article-1.278743|access-date=January 28, 2017|agency=[[New York Daily News]]|date=April 10, 2008}}</ref> In 2007, Glover agreed with Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez that the Touissant Louverture film would be financed by Venezuela. On May 19, 2007, the National Assembly of Venezuela approved giving Glover $18,000,000 for the film.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/may/21/film.venezuela|title=Venezuela giving Danny Glover $18m to direct film on epic slave revolt|last=Carroll|first=Rory|date=2007-05-21|website=[[The Guardian]]|language=en|access-date=2018-04-20}}</ref> The following year, on April 9, 2008, the National Assembly of Venezuela, at the request of the Chávez, approved another $9,000,000 to be handed to Glover in order to "continue" the filming of the film about Touissant. Surprisingly, in an interview dated January 5, 2015, published in ''Filmmaker'' magazine, Glover says, “The film that we always missed is a movie on the Haitian revolution and Toussaint Louverture. The company is fortuitously named after him and that was the movie that I wanted to do. We’ve developed a script. We thought we were going to get it done four years ago. We thought we were going to be making it right now. But also there are other kinds of things that intrigue me”. As of 2015, the film had not been made.<ref name="Filmmaker">{{cite news|url=http://filmmakermagazine.com/88801-i-can-make-this-happen-danny-glover-on-producing/|title='I Can Make This Happen': Danny Glover on Producing|last=Anderson|first=Ariston|date=January 15, 2015|work=Filmmaker|access-date=16 August 2017}}</ref>

Glover was also a board member of [[TeleSUR]], a media network primarily funded by the Venezuelan government.<ref name="GUARDIAN"/> During the beginning of the [[2014 Venezuela Protests]], Glover shared his support to Chávez's successor, President [[Nicolás Maduro]], calling members of his government "the stewards" of Venezuela's democracy. Glover also told Venezuelan government supporters to go fight for the sovereignty of Maduro's government.<ref name=NP2014>{{cite news|title=Actor Danny Glover voices support for Venezuelan president during visit to honour Hugo Chavez as anti-government protests continue|url=http://news.nationalpost.com/scene/actor-danny-glover-supports-venezuelan-government-during-visit-to-honour-hugo-chavez|access-date=August 22, 2015|agency=[[National Post]]|date=March 7, 2014}}</ref> Through the [[crisis in Bolivarian Venezuela]], Glover continued to show his support for the Bolivarian government and President Maduro's administration.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.lapatilla.com/site/2018/04/18/pura-risa-y-nada-de-la-millonada-danny-glover-y-el-teniente-escalona-en-miraflores-foto/|title=Pura risa y nada de la millonada… Danny Glover y el teniente Escalona en Miraflores (Foto)|website=[[La Patilla]]|language=es-ES|access-date=2018-04-20}}</ref>

[http://www.looktothestars.org/charity/301-jazz-foundation-of-america Jazz Foundation of America]. Accessed: January 19, 2010.</ref> He became involved with The Jazz Foundation in 2005, and has been a featured host for their annual benefit ''A Great Night in Harlem''<ref name="Danny Glover at the JFA">[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-144569283.html "Danny Glover Joins the Jazz Foundation of America (JFA) to Kick Off 5th Annual 'Great Night in Harlem' Benefit"]{{dead link|date=February 2019|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}, PR Newswire, April 17, 2006</ref> for several years, as well appearing as a celebrity MC at other events for the foundation. In 2006, Britain's leading African theatre company [[Tiata Fahodzi]] appointed Glover as one of its three Patrons, joining [[Chiwetel Ejiofor]] and [[Jocelyn Jee Esien]] opening the organization's tenth-anniversary celebrations (February 2, 2008) at the [[Theatre Royal Stratford East]], London.

==Honors and awards==

In 2010, Glover delivered the Commencement Address and was awarded an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters degree from [[Utah State University]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/700030728/Danny-Glover-urges-USU-graduates-to-be-informed-engaged.html|title=Danny Glover urges USU graduates to be informed, engaged|author=Wendy Leonard|work=Deseret News}}</ref>

Also in 2010, [[Starr King School for the Ministry]] awarded the Doctorate of Humane Letters (Litterarum Humanarum Doctor), in absentia, to Mr. Glover. His call to humanity to see itself as the recipient of a legacy of caring and commitment that began with prior parental and religious communities and that it should carry on for the sake of those who will follow are in alignment with Starr King's values.
Mr. Glover was awarded the doctorate specifically for his long history of passionate activism, including support for the United Farm Workers, UNITE HERE, The Algebra Project, The Black AIDS Institute, as well as his humanitarian efforts on behalf of the Haiti earthquake victims, literacy and civil rights and his fight against unjust labor practices. Mr. Glover is co-founder and CEO of Louverture Films, dedicated to the development and production of films of historical relevance, social purpose, commercial value and artistic integrity; we honored his commitment to using film to lift up and advance social justice issues, such as his then recently released project "Trouble the Water", a documentary about New Orleans in the aftermath of hurricane Katrina. Glover has had a close association with Starr King School through his role as guest lecturer in its course on Non Violent Social Change and lending his support and presence to events sponsored by Starr King's Masters of Arts in Social Change (MASC) program.

He was also the recipient of a tribute paid by the Deauville American Film Festival in France on September 7, 2011.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

Glover was awarded the Cuban National [[Medal of Friendship]] by the [[Cuban Council of State]] on December 29, 2016 in a ceremony in [[Havana]] for his solidarity with the [[Cuban 5]] during their time of incarceration in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?act=url&depth=1&hl=en&ie=UTF8&prev=_t&rurl=translate.google.com&sl=es&sp=nmt3&tl=en&u=http://www.icap.cu/noticias-del-dia/2016-12-29-reciben-medalla-de-la-amistad-danny-glover-estela-y-ernesto-bravo.html&usg=ALkJrhjzOmUrFPV14J3xu9JmeiOSEtzMrA|title=Google Translate}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://radiohc.cu/noticias/nacionales/117018-cuba-entregan-medalla-de-la-amistad-a-danny-glover-estela-y-ernesto-bravo|title=Radio Habana Cuba - Cuba: Entregan Medalla de la Amistad a Danny Glover, Estela y Ernesto Bravo}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.plenglish.com/index.php?o=rn&id=7541&SEO=cuba-decorates-danny-glover-estela-and-ernesto-bravo|title=Cuba Decorates Danny Glover, Estela and Ernesto Bravo}}</ref>
