The '''Reith Lectures''' is a series of annual [[radio]] [[lecture]]s given by leading figures of the day, commissioned by the [[BBC]] and broadcast on [[BBC Radio 4]] and the [[BBC World Service]]. The lectures were inaugurated in 1948 by the [[BBC]] to mark the historic contribution made to public service broadcasting by [[John Reith, 1st Baron Reith|Lord Reith]], the corporation's first director-general.

Reith maintained that broadcasting should be a public service which enriches the intellectual and cultural life of the nation. It is in this spirit that the BBC each year invites a leading figure to deliver a series of lectures on radio. The aim is to advance public understanding and debate about significant issues of contemporary interest.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/features/the-reith-lectures/about/ |title=Radio 4 - The Reith Lectures - About Reith |publisher=BBC |date=1970-01-01 |accessdate=2013-11-02}}</ref>

The first Reith lecturer was the philosopher and [[Nobel laureate]], [[Bertrand Russell]]. The first female lecturer was [[Margery Perham|Dame Margery Perham]] in 1961, who spoke on the impact of colonialism in her series of talks entitled ''The Colonial Reckoning''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00h9lb4|title=Margery Perham: The Colonial Reckoning: 1961, The Reith Lectures - BBC Radio 4|website=BBC}}</ref> The youngest Reith Lecturer was [[Colin Blakemore]], who was 32 years old in 1976 when he broadcast six lectures on the brain and consciousness, titled ''Mechanics of the Mind''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00gmw6w|title=Colin Blakemore: Mechanics of the Mind: 1976, The Reith Lectures - BBC Radio 4|website=BBC}}</ref>
