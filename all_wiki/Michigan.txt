The area was first occupied by a succession of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribes over thousands of years. Inhabited by Natives, [[Métis]], and French explorers in the 17th century, it was claimed as part of [[New France]] colony. After France's defeat in the [[French and Indian War]] in 1762, the region came under British rule. Britain ceded the territory to the newly independent United States after Britain's defeat in the [[American Revolutionary War]]. The area was part of the larger [[Northwest Territory]] until 1800, when western Michigan became part of the [[Indiana Territory]]. [[Michigan Territory]] was formed in 1805, but some of the northern border with Canada was not agreed upon until after the [[War of 1812]]. Michigan was admitted into the Union in 1837 as the 26th state, a free one. It soon became an important center of industry and trade in the Great Lakes region and a popular émigré destination in the late 19th and early 20th centuries; [[immigration]] from many [[Europe|European countries]] to Michigan was also the busiest at that time, especially for those who emigrated from [[Finland]], [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] and the [[Netherlands]].<ref>{{cite book |first = Reed |last = Ueda |title = America's Changing Neighborhoods: An Exploration of Diversity through Places |publisher = Greenwood |year = 2017 |isbn = 978-1-4408-2864-5 }}</ref>

Although Michigan developed a diverse economy, it is widely known as the center of the U.S. [[automotive industry]], which developed as a major economic force in the early 20th century. It is home to the country's [[Big Three (automobile manufacturers)|three major automobile companies]] (whose headquarters are all in Metro Detroit). While sparsely populated, the Upper Peninsula is important for tourism due to its abundance of natural resources,<ref>{{Cite web |url = https://www.smithsonianmag.com/travel/the-wonderful-wilderness-of-michigans-upper-peninsula-1803122/ |title = The Wonderful Wilderness of Michigan's Upper Peninsula |last = Kandell |first = Jonathan |website = Smithsonian |language = en |access-date = February 28, 2019 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20190301135912/https://www.smithsonianmag.com/travel/the-wonderful-wilderness-of-michigans-upper-peninsula-1803122/ |archive-date = March 1, 2019 |url-status = live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url = https://www.nmu.edu/upperpeninsulastudies/environmental-history-upper-peninsula-michigan |title = An Environmental History of the Upper Peninsula of Michigan: An Outline |publisher = NMU Center for U.P.

==History==

{{See also|Timeline of Michigan history|History of Michigan}}

When the first European explorers arrived, the most populous tribes were [[Algonquian peoples]], which include the [[Anishinaabe]] groups of [[Ojibwe]] (referred to as "Chippewa" in the United States), [[Ottawa (tribe)|Odaawaa/Odawa (Ottawa)]], and the [[Potawatomi|Boodewaadamii/Bodéwadmi (Potawatomi)]]. The three nations co-existed peacefully as part of a loose confederation called the [[Council of Three Fires]]. The Ojibwe, whose numbers are estimated to have been between 25,000 and 35,000, were the largest.

The Ojibwe were established in Michigan's Upper Peninsula and [[northern Michigan|northern]] and [[central Michigan]], and also inhabited [[Ontario]] and southern [[Manitoba]], Canada; and northern [[Wisconsin]], and northern and north-central [[Minnesota]]. The Ottawa lived primarily south of the [[Straits of Mackinac]] in northern, [[western Michigan|western]] and [[southern Michigan]], but also in southern Ontario, northern Ohio and eastern Wisconsin. The Potawatomi were in southern and western Michigan, in addition to northern and central Indiana, northern Illinois, southern Wisconsin, and southern Ontario. Other Algonquian tribes in Michigan, in the south and east, were the [[Mascouten]], the [[Menominee]], the [[Miami (tribe)|Miami]], the [[Sac people|Sac]] (or Sauk), and the [[Meskwaki|Meskwaki (Fox)]]. The [[Wyandot people|Wyandot]] were an Iroquoian-speaking people in this area; they were historically known as the Huron by the French.

French ''[[voyageurs]]'' and ''[[Coureur des bois|coureurs des bois]]'' explored and settled in Michigan in the 17th century. The first Europeans to reach what became Michigan were those of [[Étienne Brûlé]]'s expedition in 1622. The first permanent European settlement was founded in 1668 on the site where Père [[Jacques Marquette]] established [[Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan]], as a base for Catholic missions.<ref>{{cite web |title = Chronology of Michigan History |url = http://www.legislature.mi.gov/documents/publications/manual/2003-2004/2003-mm-0003-0019-Chron.pdf |page = 3 |access-date = September 30, 2009 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110721045242/http://www.legislature.mi.gov/documents/publications/manual/2003-2004/2003-mm-0003-0019-Chron.pdf |archive-date = July 21, 2011 |url-status = live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title = Sault Ste Marie Pure Michigan |url = http://www.saultstemarie.com/soo-area-and-great-waters-region/our-local-history/ |website = Sault Ste Marie |access-date = June 9, 2016 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160612002509/http://www.saultstemarie.com/soo-area-and-great-waters-region/our-local-history/ |archive-date = June 12, 2016 |url-status = dead }}</ref> Missionaries in 1671–75 founded outlying stations at [[Saint Ignace, Michigan|Saint Ignace]] and [[Marquette, Michigan|Marquette]]. Jesuit missionaries were well received by the area's Indian populations, with few difficulties or hostilities. In 1679, [[Robert Cavelier, Sieur de la Salle]] built [[Fort Miami (Michigan)|Fort Miami]] at present-day [[St. Joseph, Michigan|St. Joseph]]. In 1691, the French established a trading post and Fort St. Joseph along the St. Joseph River at the present-day city of [[Niles, Michigan|Niles]].

[[File:Michigan 1718.jpg|thumb|Approximate area of Michigan highlighted in [[Guillaume de L'Isle]]'s 1718 map]]

In 1701, French explorer and army officer [[Antoine de la Mothe Cadillac]] founded [[Fort Pontchartrain du Détroit]] or "Fort Pontchartrain on-the-Strait" on the strait, known as the [[Detroit River]], between lakes [[Lake Saint Clair (North America)|Saint Clair]] and [[Lake Erie|Erie]]. Cadillac had convinced [[Louis XIV of France|King Louis XIV's]] chief minister, [[Louis Phélypeaux (1643-1727)|Louis Phélypeaux, Comte de Pontchartrain]], that a permanent community there would strengthen French control over the upper Great Lakes and discourage [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] aspirations.

The hundred soldiers and workers who accompanied Cadillac built a fort enclosing one [[arpent]]<ref name=tbaytel>{{cite web |url = http://my.tbaytel.net/bmartin/cadillac.htm |title = Cadillac's Village or Detroit under Cadillac |access-date = January 5, 2007 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20061209205600/http://my.tbaytel.net/bmartin/cadillac.htm |archive-date = December 9, 2006 |url-status = live }}</ref><ref name=histdet>{{cite web |url = http://www.historydetroit.com/places/fort_ponchartrain.asp |title = History Detroit 1701–2001 |access-date = January 5, 2007 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20061209065758/http://www.historydetroit.com/places/fort_ponchartrain.asp |archive-date = December 9, 2006 |url-status = live }}</ref> (about {{convert|0.85|acre|m2}}, the equivalent of just under {{convert|200|ft|m}} per side) and named it [[Fort Pontchartrain]]. Cadillac's wife, Marie Thérèse Guyon, soon moved to Detroit, becoming one of the first European women to settle in what was considered the wilderness of Michigan. The town quickly became a major [[fur trade|fur-trading]] and shipping post. The ''[[Ste. Anne de Detroit Catholic Church|Église de Saint-Anne]]'' (Church of Saint Ann) was founded the same year. While the original building does not survive, the congregation remains active. Cadillac later departed to serve as the French governor of Louisiana from 1710 to 1716. French attempts to consolidate the fur trade led to the [[Fox Wars]] involving the Meskwaki (Fox) and their allies versus the French and their Native allies.

At the same time, the French strengthened [[Fort Michilimackinac]] at the Straits of Mackinac to better control their lucrative fur-trading empire. By the mid-18th century, the French also occupied forts at present-day Niles and Sault Ste. Marie, though most of the rest of the region remained unsettled by Europeans. France offered free land to attract families to Detroit, which grew to 800 people in 1765, and was the largest city between Montreal and New Orleans.<ref>{{cite web |url = https://www.archives.gov.on.ca/ENGLISH/exhibits/franco_ontarian/detroit.htm |title = French Ontario in the 17th and 18th centuries: Detroit |publisher = Archives of Ontario |date = July 14, 2008 |access-date = July 23, 2008 |url-status = dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20040824111504/http://www.archives.gov.on.ca/ENGLISH/exhibits/franco_ontarian/detroit.htm |archive-date = August 24, 2004 }}</ref> French settlers also established small farms south of the Detroit River opposite the fort, near a Jesuit mission and Huron village.

From 1660 until the end of French rule, Michigan was part of the Royal Province of [[New France]].<ref group=lower-alpha>The Province included the modern states of Wisconsin, eastern Minnesota, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Kentucky, Tennessee, Mississippi, Alabama, two-thirds of Georgia, and small parts of West Virginia, Pennsylvania, New York, Vermont, and Maine</ref> In 1760, [[Montreal]] fell to the British forces ending the [[French and Indian War]] (1754–1763). Under the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|1763 Treaty of Paris]], Michigan and the rest of New France east of the Mississippi River passed to Great Britain.<ref>{{cite book |title = The Encyclopædia Britannica |page = 158 |edition = 11th |year = 1910 }}</ref> After the [[Quebec Act]] was passed in 1774, Michigan became part of the British [[Province of Quebec (1763-1791)|Province of Quebec]]. By 1778, Detroit's population was up to 2,144 and it was the third-largest city in Quebec.<ref>{{cite book |first1 = Jacqueline |last1 = Peterson |first2 = Jennifer S.H. |last2 = Brown |name-list-style = amp |title = Many Roads to Red River |year = 2001 |page = 69 }}{{full citation needed|date= July 2015}}</ref>

During the [[American Revolutionary War]], Detroit was an important British supply center. Most of the inhabitants were French-Canadians or Native Americans, many of whom had been allied with the French because of long trading ties. Because of imprecise cartography and unclear language defining the boundaries in the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|1783 Treaty of Paris]], the British retained control of Detroit and Michigan after the [[American Revolution]]. When Quebec split into Lower and Upper Canada in 1791, Michigan was part of [[Kent County, Ontario|Kent County]], Upper Canada. It held its first democratic elections in August 1792 to send delegates to the new provincial parliament at Newark (now [[Niagara-on-the-Lake, Ontario|Niagara-on-the-Lake]]).<ref name=SFarmer>{{Cite book |last = Farmer |first = Silas |title = The History of Detroit and Michigan; or, The Metropolis Illustrated; A Full Record of Territorial Days in Michigan, and the Annals of Wayne County |orig-year = 1889 |url = http://name.umdl.umich.edu/bad1459.0001.001 |access-date = June 15, 2006 |year = 2005 |via = University of Michigan Library |page = 94 |chapter = Legislatures and Laws |chapter-url = http://www.hti.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=micounty;cc=micounty;rgn=full%20text;idno=BAD1459.0001.001;didno=BAD1459.0001.001;view=image;seq=00000152 }}</ref>

Under terms negotiated in the 1794 [[Jay Treaty]], Britain withdrew from Detroit and Michilimackinac in 1796. It retained control of territory east and south of the Detroit River, which are now included in Ontario, Canada. Questions remained over the boundary for many years, and the United States did not have uncontested control of the Upper Peninsula and [[Drummond Island]] until 1818 and 1847, respectively.

During the [[War of 1812]], the United States forces at Fort Detroit surrendered [[Michigan Territory]] (effectively consisting of Detroit and the surrounding area) after a nearly bloodless [[Siege of Detroit|siege]] in 1812. A US attempt to retake Detroit resulted in a severe American defeat in the [[River Raisin Massacre]]. This battle, still ranked as the bloodiest ever fought in the state, had the highest number of American casualties of any battle in the war.

Michigan was recaptured by the Americans in 1813 after the [[Battle of Lake Erie]]. They used Michigan as a base to launch an invasion of Canada, which culminated in the [[Battle of the Thames]]. But the more northern areas of Michigan were held by the British until the peace treaty restored the old boundaries. A number of forts, including [[Fort Wayne (Detroit)|Fort Wayne]], were built by the United States in Michigan during the 19th century out of fears of renewed fighting with Britain.

The population grew slowly until the opening in 1825 of the [[Erie Canal]] through the Mohawk Valley in New York, connecting the Great Lakes to the Hudson River and New York City. The new route attracted a large influx of settlers to the Michigan territory. They worked as farmers, lumbermen, shipbuilders, and merchants and shipped out grain, lumber, and iron ore. By the 1830s, Michigan had 80,000 residents, more than enough to apply and qualify for statehood.

A Constitutional Convention of Assent, led by [[G. Mott Williams|Gershom Mott Williams]], was held to lead the territory to statehood.<ref name="Progress">{{cite book |title = Men of Progress: Embracing Biographical Sketches of Representative Michigan Men with an Outline History of the State |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=lPlAAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA313 |year = 1900 |publisher = Evening News Assoc. |page = 313 |access-date = October 31, 2016 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180818082123/https://books.google.com/books?id=lPlAAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA313 |archive-date = August 18, 2018 |url-status = live }}</ref>
In October 1835 the people approved the Constitution of 1835, thereby forming a state government, although [[United States Congress|Congressional]] recognition was delayed pending resolution of a boundary dispute with [[Ohio]] known as the [[Toledo War]]. Congress awarded the "Toledo Strip" to Ohio. Michigan received the western part of the Upper Peninsula as a concession and formally entered the Union as a free state on January 26, 1837. The Upper Peninsula proved to be a rich source of lumber, iron, and copper. Michigan led the nation in lumber production from the 1850s to the 1880s. [[History of railroads in Michigan|Railroads]] became a major engine of growth from the 1850s onward, with [[History of Detroit|Detroit the chief hub]].

A second wave of French-Canadian immigrants settled in Michigan during the late 19th to early 20th century, working in lumbering areas in counties on the Lake Huron side of the Lower Peninsula, such as the Saginaw Valley, Alpena, and Cheboygan counties, as well as throughout the Upper Peninsula, with large concentrations in Escanaba and the [[Keweenaw Peninsula]].<ref>{{cite book |last1 = Dulong |first1 = John |title = French Canadians in Michigan |date = 2001 |publisher = Michigan State University Press |location = Lansing, Michigan |isbn = 9780870135828 |pages = 3–5 }}</ref> This was also a period of development of the [[gypsum]] industry in [[Alabaster, Michigan]], which became nationally prominent.

The first statewide meeting of the [[History of the United States Republican Party|Republican Party]] took place July 6, 1854, in [[Jackson, Michigan]], where the party adopted its platform. The state was heavily Republican until the 1930s. Michigan made [[Michigan in the American Civil War|a significant contribution]] to the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] in the [[American Civil War]] and sent more than forty regiments of volunteers to the federal armies.

Modernizers and boosters set up systems for public education, including founding the [[University of Michigan]] (1817, moved to [[Ann Arbor, Michigan|Ann Arbor]] in 1837) for a classical academic education; and Michigan State Normal School (1849), now [[Eastern Michigan University]], for the training of teachers. It adopted this model from the German educational system. In 1899, Michigan State became the first normal college in the nation to offer a four-year curriculum. Michigan Agricultural College (1855), now [[Michigan State University]] in [[East Lansing, Michigan|East Lansing]], was founded as the pioneer [[land-grant college]], a model for those authorized under the [[Morrill Act]] (1862). Many private colleges were founded as well, and the smaller cities established high schools late in the century.<ref>{{cite book |last1 = Dunbar |last2 = May |title = Michigan: A History of the Wolverine State |url = https://archive.org/details/michiganhistoryo01dunb |url-access = registration |chapter = Chapter 14 |year = 1980 |name-list-style = amp }}</ref>

Michigan's economy underwent a transformation at the turn of the 20th century. Many individuals, including [[Ransom E. Olds]], [[John Francis Dodge|John]] and [[Horace Elgin Dodge|Horace Dodge]], [[Henry Leland]], [[David Dunbar Buick]], [[Henry Bourne Joy|Henry Joy]], [[Charles Brady King|Charles King]], and [[Henry Ford]], provided the concentration of engineering know-how and technological enthusiasm to develop the [[History of the automobile|automotive industry]].<ref>{{cite book |first = John B. |last1 = Rae |author-link = John B.

Like the [[steamship]] and railroad, mass production of automobiles was a far-reaching development. More than the forms of public transportation, the affordable automobile transformed private life. Automobile production became the major industry of Detroit and Michigan, and permanently altered the socio-economic life of the United States and much of the world.

With the growth, the auto industry created jobs in Detroit that attracted immigrants from Europe and migrants from across the United States, including both blacks and whites from the rural [[Southern United States|South]]. By 1920, Detroit was the fourth-largest city in the US. Residential housing was in short supply, and it took years for the market to catch up with the population boom. By the 1930s, so many immigrants had arrived that more than 30 languages were spoken in the public schools, and [[ethnic]] communities celebrated in annual heritage festivals. Over the years immigrants and migrants contributed greatly to Detroit's diverse urban culture, including popular music trends. The influential [[Motown|Motown Sound]] of the 1960s was led by a variety of individual singers and groups.

[[Grand Rapids, Michigan|Grand Rapids]], the second-largest city in Michigan, is also an important center of manufacturing. Since 1838, the city has been noted for its furniture industry. In the 21st century, it is home to five of the world's leading office furniture companies. Grand Rapids is home to a number of major companies including [[Steelcase]], [[Amway]], and [[Meijer]]. Grand Rapids is also an important center for [[GE Aviation Systems]].

Michigan held its first [[United States presidential primary]] election in 1910. With its rapid growth in industry, it was an important center of industry-wide union organizing, such as the rise of the [[United Auto Workers]].

In 1920 [[WWJ (AM)]] in Detroit became the first radio station in the United States to regularly broadcast commercial programs. Throughout that decade, some of the country's largest and most ornate [[List of tallest buildings in Detroit|skyscrapers]] were built in the city. Particularly noteworthy are the [[Fisher Building]], [[Cadillac Place]], and the [[Guardian Building]], each of which has been designated as a [[National Historic Landmark]] (NHL).

In 1927 a school bombing took place in [[Clinton County, Michigan|Clinton County]]. The [[Bath School disaster]], perpetrated by an adult man, resulted in the deaths of 38 schoolchildren and constitutes the deadliest mass murder in a school in U.S. history.

Michigan converted much of its manufacturing to satisfy defense needs during World War II; it manufactured 10.9 percent of the United States military armaments produced during the war, ranking second (behind [[New York (state)|New York]]) among the 48 states.<ref>{{cite book |author1-link = Whiz Kids (Department of Defense) |last1 = Peck |first1 = Merton J. |author2-link = Frederic M.

Detroit continued to expand through the 1950s, at one point doubling its population in a decade. After [[World War II]], housing was developed in suburban areas outside city cores to meet demand for residences. The federal government subsidized the construction of [[Interstate Highway System|interstate highways]], which were intended to strengthen military access, but also allowed commuters and business traffic to travel the region more easily. Since 1960, modern advances in the auto industry have led to increased automation, high-tech industry, and increased suburban growth.

===State government===

{{Main|Government of Michigan}}

Michigan is governed as a republic, with three [[separation of powers|branches of government]]: the [[executive branch]] consisting of the [[Governor of Michigan]] and the other independently elected constitutional officers; the [[legislative branch]] consisting of the [[Michigan State House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] and [[Michigan Senate|Senate]]; and the [[judicial branch]]. The [[Michigan Constitution]] allows for the direct participation of the electorate by statutory [[initiative]] and [[referendum]], [[recall election|recall]], and constitutional initiative and [[ratification|referral]] (Article II, § 9,<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.legislature.mi.gov/printDocument.aspx?objName=mcl-article-ii-9&version=txt |title = Article II, § 9 of State Constitution |publisher = Michigan Legislature |access-date = June 27, 2012 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130117041635/http://www.legislature.mi.gov/(S(dmjr2jejmjc0at2whhlicz55))/printDocument.aspx?objName=mcl-article-ii-9&version=txt |archive-date = January 17, 2013 |url-status = live }}</ref> defined as "the power to propose laws and to enact and reject laws, called the initiative, and the power to approve or reject laws enacted by the legislature, called the referendum. The power of initiative extends only to laws which the legislature may enact under this constitution"). [[Lansing, Michigan|Lansing]] is the [[list of capitals in the United States|state capital]] and is home to all three branches of state government.

The governor and the other state constitutional officers serve four-year terms and may be re-elected only once. The current governor is [[Gretchen Whitmer]]. Michigan has two official [[Michigan Governor's Residence|Governor's Residences]]; one is in Lansing, and the other is at [[Mackinac Island]]. The other constitutionally elected executive officers are the [[Lieutenant Governor of Michigan|lieutenant governor]], who is elected on a joint ticket with the governor, the [[Secretary of State of Michigan|secretary of state]], and the [[Attorney General of Michigan|attorney general]]. The lieutenant governor presides over the Senate (voting only in case of a tie) and is also a member of the cabinet. The secretary of state is the chief elections officer and is charged with running many licensure programs including motor vehicles, all of which are done through the branch offices of the secretary of state.

The [[Michigan Legislature]] consists of a 38-member Senate and 110-member House of Representatives. Members of both houses of the legislature are elected through [[first past the post]] elections by single-member electoral districts of near-equal population that often have boundaries which coincide with county and municipal lines. Senators serve four-year terms concurrent to those of the governor, while representatives serve two-year terms. The [[Michigan State Capitol]] was dedicated in 1879 and has hosted the executive and legislative branches of the state ever since.

The Michigan judiciary consists of two courts with primary jurisdiction (the Circuit Courts and the District Courts), one intermediate level appellate court (the [[Michigan Court of Appeals]]), and the [[Michigan Supreme Court]]. There are several administrative courts and specialized courts. District courts are trial courts of [[limited jurisdiction]], handling most traffic violations, small claims, [[misdemeanor]]s, and civil suits where the amount contended is below $25,000. District courts are often responsible for handling the preliminary examination and for setting bail in felony cases. District court judges are elected to terms of six years. In a few locations, municipal courts have been retained to the exclusion of the establishment of district courts. There are 57 circuit courts in the State of Michigan, which have [[original jurisdiction]] over all civil suits where the amount contended in the case exceeds $25,000 and all criminal cases involving [[felony|felonies]]. Circuit courts are also the only trial courts in the State of Michigan which possess the power to issue [[equitable remedies]]. Circuit courts have [[appellate jurisdiction]] from district and municipal courts, as well as from decisions and decrees of state agencies. Most counties have their own circuit court, but sparsely populated counties often share them. Circuit court judges are elected to terms of six years. State appellate court judges are elected to terms of six years, but vacancies are filled by an appointment by the governor. There are four divisions of the Court of Appeals in Detroit, Grand Rapids, Lansing, and Marquette. Cases are heard by the Court of Appeals by panels of three judges, who examine the application of the law and not the facts of the case unless there has been grievous error pertaining to questions of fact. The Michigan Supreme Court consists of seven members who are elected on non-partisan ballots for staggered eight-year terms. The Supreme Court has original jurisdiction only in narrow circumstances but holds appellate jurisdiction over the entire state judicial system.

Michigan voters commonly elect candidates from both major parties, and it is generally regarded as a "swing" state which can be won by either [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] or [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] presidential candidates. Governors since the 1970s have alternated between the two parties, and statewide offices including [[Michigan Attorney General|attorney general]], [[Michigan Secretary of State|secretary of state]], and [[United States Senate|senator]] have been held by members of both parties in varying proportion. The Republican Party holds a majority in both the House and Senate of the Michigan Legislature. The state's [[United States congressional delegations from Michigan|congressional delegation]] is commonly split, with one party or the other typically holding a narrow majority.

Republican strongholds of the state include rural areas of Western and Northern Michigan, the [[Upper Peninsula]], the suburbs around Grand Rapids, and [[Livingston County, Michigan|Livingston County]]. Areas of Democratic strength include the cities of [[Detroit]], Ann Arbor, Lansing, [[Flint, Michigan|Flint]], urban Grand Rapids, and [[Muskegon, Michigan|Muskegon]]. Much of suburban Detroit—which includes parts of [[Oakland County, Michigan|Oakland]], [[Macomb County, Michigan|Macomb]], and [[Wayne County, Michigan|Wayne counties]]—is politically competitive between the two parties.

Historically, the first county-level meeting of the Republican Party took place in Jackson on July 6, 1854,<ref>{{cite sign |author=Michigan Historical Marker Program |url=http://www.jacksonmich.com/markers/mark1.htm |title=Under the Oaks |location=Jackson |publisher=[[Michigan Department of Natural Resources]] |date=February 18, 1956 |access-date = July 25, 2010 |medium=Michigan Historical Marker |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101008104420/http://jacksonmich.com/markers/mark1.htm |archive-date=October 8, 2010 |url-status=live}}</ref> and the party thereafter dominated Michigan until the [[Great Depression]]. In the [[1912 United States presidential election|1912 election]], Michigan was one of the six states to support progressive Republican and third-party candidate [[Theodore Roosevelt]] for president after he lost the Republican nomination to [[William Howard Taft]].

Michigan remained fairly reliably Republican at the presidential level for much of the 20th century. It was part of Greater New England, the northern tier of states settled chiefly by migrants from New England who carried their culture with them. The state was one of only a handful to back [[Wendell Willkie]] over [[Franklin Roosevelt]] in [[1940 United States presidential election|1940]], and supported [[Thomas E. Dewey]] in his losing bid against [[Harry S. Truman]] in [[1948 United States presidential election|1948]]. Michigan went to the Democrats in presidential elections during the 1960s and voted for the Republican candidate in every election from 1972 to 1988. Between 1992 and 2012 it supported the Democrats; early on in 2016, it was pegged as a [[swing state]], and was narrowly won by the GOP candidate, [[Donald Trump]].

Michigan was the home of [[Gerald Ford]], the 38th president of the United States.

===Administrative divisions===

{{Main|Administrative divisions of Michigan}}
{{See also|List of Michigan county seats|List of counties in Michigan|List of municipalities in Michigan (by population)}}

State government is decentralized among three tiers—statewide, county and [[Civil township|township]]. Counties are administrative divisions of the state, and townships are administrative divisions of a county. Both of them exercise state government authority, localized to meet the particular needs of their jurisdictions, as provided by state law. There are 83 [[List of counties in Michigan|counties in Michigan]].

Cities, [[State university system|state universities]], and villages are vested with [[home rule]] powers of varying degrees. Home rule cities can generally do anything not prohibited by law. The fifteen state universities have broad power and can do anything within the parameters of their status as educational institutions that is not prohibited by the state constitution. Villages, by contrast, have limited home rule and are not completely autonomous from the county and township in which they are located.

There are two types of township in Michigan: ''general law'' township and ''charter''. [[Charter township]] status was created by the Legislature in 1947 and grants additional powers and stream-lined administration in order to provide greater protection against annexation by a city. {{as of|2001|April}}, there were 127 charter townships in Michigan. In general, charter townships have many of the same powers as a city but without the same level of obligations. For example, a charter township can have its own fire department, water and sewer department, police department, and so on—just like a city—but it is not ''required'' to have those things, whereas cities ''must'' provide those services. Charter townships can opt to use county-wide services instead, such as deputies from the county sheriff's office instead of a home-based force of ordinance officers.

The Great Lakes that border Michigan from east to west are Lake Erie, [[Lake Huron]], [[Lake Michigan]] and [[Lake Superior]]. The state is bounded on the south by the states of Ohio and [[Indiana]], sharing land and water boundaries with both. Michigan's western boundaries are almost entirely water boundaries, from south to north, with [[Illinois]] and Wisconsin in Lake Michigan; then a land boundary with Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula, that is principally demarcated by the [[Menominee River|Menominee]] and [[Montreal River (Wisconsin-Michigan)|Montreal Rivers]]; then water boundaries again, in Lake Superior, with Wisconsin and Minnesota to the west, capped around by the Canadian province of Ontario to the north and east.

The surface on either side of this range is rugged. The state's highest point, in the [[Huron Mountains]] northwest of Marquette, is [[Mount Arvon]] at {{convert|1979|ft|m}}. The peninsula is as large as Connecticut, Delaware, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island combined but has fewer than 330,000 inhabitants. They are sometimes called "Yoopers" (from "U.P.'ers"), and their speech (the "[[Yooper dialect]]") has been heavily influenced by the numerous [[Scandinavia]]n and Canadian immigrants who settled the area during the lumbering and [[Copper mining in Michigan|mining boom]] of the late 19th century.

The surface of the peninsula is generally level, broken by conical hills and glacial [[moraine]]s usually not more than a few hundred feet tall. It is divided by a low water divide running north and south. The larger portion of the state is on the west of this and gradually slopes toward Lake Michigan. The highest point in the Lower Peninsula is either Briar Hill at {{convert|1705|ft|m}}, or one of several points nearby in the vicinity of [[Cadillac, Michigan|Cadillac]]. The lowest point is the surface of Lake Erie at {{convert|571|ft|m}}.

The geographic orientation of Michigan's peninsulas makes for a long distance between the ends of the state. [[Ironwood, Michigan|Ironwood]], in the far western Upper Peninsula, lies {{convert|630|mi|abbr=off|sp=us}} by highway from [[Lambertville, Michigan|Lambertville]] in the Lower Peninsula's southeastern corner. The geographic isolation of the Upper Peninsula from Michigan's political and population centers makes the U.P. culturally and economically distinct. Occasionally U.P. residents have called for [[secession]] from Michigan and establishment as a new state to be called "[[Superior (proposed U.S. state)|Superior]]".

A feature of Michigan that gives it the distinct shape of a mitten is the Thumb. This peninsula projects out into Lake Huron and the [[Saginaw Bay]]. The geography of the Thumb is mainly flat with a few rolling hills. Other peninsulas of Michigan include the Keweenaw Peninsula, making up the [[Copper Country]] region of the state. The [[Leelanau County, Michigan|Leelanau Peninsula]] lies in the Northern Lower Michigan region. ''See Also [[List of regions of the United States#Michigan|Michigan Regions]]''

Michigan has a [[humid continental climate|continental climate]], although there are two distinct regions. The southern and central parts of the Lower Peninsula (south of Saginaw Bay and from the Grand Rapids area southward) have a warmer climate ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Dfa'') with hot summers and cold winters. The northern part of Lower Peninsula and the entire Upper Peninsula has a more severe climate (Köppen ''Dfb''), with warm, but shorter summers and longer, cold to very cold winters. Some parts of the state average high temperatures below freezing from December through February, and into early March in the far northern parts. During the winter through the middle of February, the state is frequently subjected to heavy [[lake-effect snow]]. The state averages from {{convert|30|to|40|in|cm}} of precipitation annually; however, some areas in the northern lower peninsula and the upper peninsula average almost {{convert|160|in}} of snowfall per year.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.crh.noaa.gov/apx/snow/snowfallAvg.php |title = Mean Annual Snowfall |author = NWS Gaylord Region |date = August 31, 2010 |publisher = National Weather Service |access-date = June 1, 2011 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20111109014721/http://www.crh.noaa.gov/apx/snow/snowfallAvg.php |archive-date = November 9, 2011 |url-status = live }}</ref> Michigan's highest recorded temperature is {{convert|112|F|C}} at [[Mio, Michigan|Mio]] on July 13, 1936, and the coldest recorded temperature is {{convert|-51|F|C}} at [[Vanderbilt, Michigan|Vanderbilt]] on February 9, 1934.<ref name="netstate">{{cite web |url = http://www.netstate.com/states/geography/mi_geography.htm |title = The Geography of Michigan |publisher = netstate.com |access-date = March 20, 2011 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110321154823/http://www.netstate.com/states/geography/mi_geography.htm |archive-date = March 21, 2011 |url-status = live }}</ref>

The state averages 30 days of thunderstorm activity per year. These can be severe, especially in the southern part of the state. The state averages 17 [[tornado]]es per year, which are more common in the state's extreme southern section. Portions of the southern border have been almost as vulnerable historically as states further west and in [[Tornado Alley]]. For this reason, many communities in the very southern portions of the state have tornado sirens to warn residents of approaching tornadoes. Farther north, in Central Michigan, Northern Michigan, and the Upper Peninsula, tornadoes are rare.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://geo.msu.edu/extra/geogmich/tornades.html |title = Tornadoes |website = geo.msu.edu |access-date = April 12, 2015 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150706174930/http://geo.msu.edu/extra/geogmich/tornades.html |archive-date = July 6, 2015 |url-status = live }}</ref><ref name="Thunderstorm hazards">{{cite web |url = http://www.srh.noaa.gov/key/HTML/tstmhazards.htm |title = Thunderstorm hazards |publisher = srh.noaa.gov |access-date = November 1, 2006 |url-status = dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20061015060809/http://www.srh.noaa.gov/key/HTML/tstmhazards.htm |archive-date = October 15, 2006 }}</ref>{{Clear}}

===Geology===

The geological formation of the state is greatly varied, with the [[Michigan Basin]] being the most major formation. Primary boulders are found over the entire surface of the Upper Peninsula (being principally of primitive origin), while Secondary deposits cover the entire Lower Peninsula. The Upper Peninsula exhibits Lower [[Silurian]] sandstones, limestones, copper and iron bearing rocks, corresponding to the Huronian system of [[Canada]]. The central portion of the Lower Peninsula contains coal measures and rocks of the [[Pennsylvanian (geology)|Pennsylvanian]] period. [[Devonian]] and sub-Carboniferous deposits are scattered over the entire state.

Michigan rarely experiences [[earthquake]]s, thus far mostly smaller ones that do not cause significant damage. A 4.6-magnitude earthquake struck in August 1947. More recently, a 4.2-magnitude earthquake occurred on Saturday, May 2, 2015, shortly after noon, about five miles south of [[Galesburg, Michigan]] (9 miles southeast of [[Kalamazoo]]) in central Michigan, about 140 miles west of Detroit, according to the Colorado-based [[U.S. Geological Survey]]'s [[National Earthquake Information Center]]. No major damage or injuries were reported, according to Governor [[Rick Snyder]]'s office.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.freep.com/story/news/local/2015/05/02/michigan-earthquake/26773069/ |title = No injuries reported after earthquake rattles Michigan |access-date = May 3, 2015 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150503111513/http://www.freep.com/story/news/local/2015/05/02/michigan-earthquake/26773069/ |archive-date = May 3, 2015 |url-status = live }}</ref>

==State symbols and nicknames==

[[File:Dwarf Lake Iris.jpg|thumb|[[Dwarf lake iris]]]]

Michigan is traditionally known as "The Wolverine State", and the University of Michigan takes the wolverine as its mascot. The association is well and long established: for example, many Detroiters volunteered to fight during the American Civil War and [[George Armstrong Custer]], who led the Michigan Brigade, called them the "Wolverines". The origins of this association are obscure; it may derive from a busy trade in wolverine furs in Sault Ste. Marie in the 18th century or may recall a disparagement intended to compare early settlers in Michigan with the vicious mammal. Wolverines are, however, extremely rare in Michigan. A sighting in February 2004 near [[Ubly, Michigan|Ubly]] was the first confirmed sighting in Michigan in 200 years.<ref name="msnbc">{{cite news |title = First Michigan wolverine spotted in 200 years |url = http://www.nbcnews.com/id/4374309 |last = Runk |first = David |date = February 25, 2004 |agency = Associated Press |publisher = NBC News |access-date = December 23, 2008 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130218042651/http://www.nbcnews.com/id/4374309 |archive-date = February 18, 2013 |url-status = live }}</ref> The animal was found dead in 2010.<ref>{{Cite news |last = Bell |first = Dawson |date = March 15, 2010 |title = Only known wolverine in the Michigan wild dies |newspaper = Detroit Free Press |url = http://www.freep.com/article/20100315/NEWS06/100315027/1318/Only-wolverine-in-Mich.-wild-dies |url-status = dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150706133328/http://www.freep.com/article/20100315/NEWS06/100315027/1318/Only-wolverine-in-Mich.-wild-dies |archive-date = July 6, 2015 }}</ref>
