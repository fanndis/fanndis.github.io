'''Fuse''' is an American [[pay television]] channel that first launched in 1994 and was originally dedicated to music. After merging with the [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Latino-oriented]] [[NuvoTV]] in 2015, Fuse shifted its focus to general entertainment and lifestyle programming targeting multicultural young adults.

As of February 2015, Fuse was available to approximately 71,491,000 pay television households (61.4% of households with television) in the United States.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2015/02/22/list-of-how-many-homes-each-cable-network-is-in-as-of-february-2015/366230/|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150223220414/http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2015/02/22/list-of-how-many-homes-each-cable-network-is-in-as-of-february-2015/366230/|url-status= dead|archive-date= February 23, 2015|title=List of how many homes each cable network is in as of February 2015 |last=Seidman |first= Robert |work= TV by the Numbers |publisher= Zap2it |date= February 22, 2015 |accessdate= March 14, 2015}}</ref> With the loss of carriage on [[Xfinity]] and [[Verizon Fios]] on January 1, 2019 and a number of cable operators discontinuing their carriage since 2015, it currently has an availability of around 38 million pay television households.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/2018/tv/news/fuse-comcast-jennifer-lopez-drops-channel-1203096848/|title=Comcast to Drop Jennifer Lopez-Owned Fuse Music Channel|last=Littleton|first=Cynthia|date=30 December 2018|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|accessdate=1 January 2019}}</ref>

==History==

===As MuchMusic USA===
The channel originally launched on July 1, 1994, as '''[[MuchMusic]] USA'''; it was founded as a [[joint venture]] between Rainbow Media (currently known as [[AMC Networks]]), a division of New York-based [[Cablevision]] and [[Toronto]]-based [[CHUM Limited]]. (CHUM also launched a [[Bravo (Canada)|Canadian counterpart]] to then-Rainbow owned arts network [[Bravo (American TV channel)|Bravo]] around a year later, though since then the two networks' programming have completely diverged.) CHUM would later sell its 50% stake in the network to Cablevision in 2000, but allowed the continued use of the "MuchMusic" name under a [[brand licensing]] agreement. Initially, the network mirrored the schedule of its [[MuchMusic|Canadian equivalent]] with U.S. advertising, but with [[French language|French-language]] programming and programs licensed from [[MTV]] and [[VH1]] blacked out and replaced with reruns of other programs or with infomercials.

However, through its early years, the channel suffered from a lack of carriage; outside of Cablevision's own systems (mostly in the New York City metro area, and at the time, Boston and Cleveland), as well as satellite providers [[DirecTV]] (which carried it as, at the time, fellow satellite provider [[United States Satellite Broadcasting|USSB]], with which it shared transponders and equipment, had the exclusive rights to all Viacom-owned channels, including MTV and VH1; these channels would eventually move to DirecTV shortly before USSB merged with them)  and now-defunct [[PrimeStar]] (which added the channel as part of an expansion to their lineup on April 20, 1997; due to limited bandwidth on their FSS platform, MuchMusic was a part-time channel running from 2:00 AM to 5:00 PM EST on weekdays, and from 12:00 PM to 5:00 PM on the weekends<ref>{{Citation|title=Primestar Promos and Commercials (1997-2000)|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWrtgubbRgE|language=en|access-date=2020-01-08}}</ref>), not many providers carried the network, an exception being Continental Cablevision (later [[MediaOne]])'s systems in New England, Ohio and Florida. Beginning in 1996, Rainbow began an effort to include US-produced original programming and music video blocks on the network's lineup, partially as a way of alleviating criticism for the channel's Canadian origins.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YA8EAAAAMBAJ&q=muchmusic+cablevision&pg=PA104|title=Billboard|last=Inc|first=Nielsen Business Media|date=1996-03-16|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|language=en}}</ref> Certain Cablevision systems in major markets also experimented with locally oriented music countdown shows, typically produced in cooperation with a local radio station (such as Cablevision's Boston system producing the ''MuchMusic Boston Countdown'' together with radio station [[WFNX (101.7 FM)|WFNX]]).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.multichannel.com/news/muchmusic-tries-local-angle-woo-ops-145818|title=MuchMusic Tries Local Angle to Woo Ops|last=Moss|first=Linda|website=Multichannel|language=en-us|access-date=2020-01-05}}</ref>

Programming from the network was also carried by two low-power television stations: W53AV (currently [[WDNI-CD]]) in [[Indianapolis|Indianapolis, IN]], and W24BW (currently [[WMYO-CD]]) in [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville, KY]]. Rainbow also aired MuchMusic programming on their Philadelphia-area sports/movies pay service [[PRISM (TV channel)|PRISM]] during that channel's final few months of operation in 1997.

In 1998, the network also began to be included in a sub-unit of Rainbow focused upon live pay-per-view events taking place at New York's world-famous [[Radio City Music Hall]] and [[Madison Square Garden]] (both also owned by Cablevision's founding Dolan family), ''Radio City Networks''.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JwoEAAAAMBAJ&q=muchmusic+cablevision&pg=PA96|title=Billboard|last=Inc|first=Nielsen Business Media|date=1998-10-17|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|language=en}}</ref>

By 2001, MuchMusic USA began to diverge from its Canadian parent; it introduced a new logo identifying itself as '''MMUSA''', and began to air its own original programming and music video blocks, often featuring user-submitted videos; the network's new direction centered around viewer interactivity via the Internet, with the "mmusa.tv" website being the focal point of the interaction.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HBQEAAAAMBAJ&q=muchmusic+cablevision&pg=PA8|title=Billboard|last=Inc|first=Nielsen Business Media|date=2001-06-09|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.amcnetworks.com/press-releases/muchmusic-usa-changes-the-face-of-music-programming-with-new-interactive-shows/|title=MuchMusic USA Changes the Face of Music Programming with New Interactive Shows|date=2001-06-01|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-05}}</ref>

Carriage of the network began to expand with the rise of [[digital cable]], with [[Time Warner Cable]] and [[Comcast]] beginning to carry the channel around this time.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RxQEAAAAMBAJ&q=muchmusic+cablevision&pg=PA92|title=Billboard|last=Inc|first=Nielsen Business Media|date=2001-03-17|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|language=en}}</ref> By December 2002, MMUSA had replaced almost the entirety of its schedule with domestically produced programming, with the only MuchMusic program remaining being ''[[RapCity]]''. An interactive TV component was also launched as part of Cablevision's [[IO Digital Cable|iO digital cable]] service in the New York area.

After CHUM revoked its licensing agreement for the U.S. channel to use the MuchMusic brand, Cablevision and Time Warner announced that it would relaunch MMUSA as '''Fuse''' in 2003.<ref>[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-99766477.html Article: muchmusic usa Becomes Fuse; Total Convergence Music Programming `Fuses' Online, TV & Interactive Game Play.]{{dead link|date=February 2019|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}} HighBeam Research</ref>

===As Fuse===
[[File:Fuse-studios1.jpg|thumb|275px|left|Fuse studios on [[Seventh Avenue (Manhattan)|Seventh Avenue]] across from [[Madison Square Garden]].]]
The channel officially relaunched as Fuse on May 19, 2003, with the debut of the critically acclaimed hip-hop comedy series ''[[Kung Faux]]''. Fuse originally focused on more [[Underground music|underground]] and [[Indie rock|indie]] music genres. Overtime, the channel would cover a much broader range of music genres such as [[Pop music|pop]], [[Urban contemporary|urban]], [[Punk rock|punk]], and [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] while still encompassing [[Underground music|underground]] [[Indie rock|indie]] music scenes and [[popular culture]].

In its early days, Fuse programming was very music-intensive. The network indirectly bashed [[MTV]] with a slogan touting Fuse as the channel "where the music went." Fuse's advertising in this period, by New York-based [[Amalgamated Advertising|Amalgamated]], generated controversy both through its more direct criticism of MTV, and through its parodies, particularly that of the [[iPod advertising|iPod ad campaign]].<ref>{{cite news |last= Mucha |first= Thomas |url= https://money.cnn.com/magazines/business2/business2_archive/2005/03/01/8253115/index.htm |title= They Want Their Fuse TV - March 1, 2005 |publisher= Money.cnn.com |date= 2005-03-01 |accessdate= 2010-06-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=dabitch |url= http://adland.tv/content/fuse-fuel-fury-mtv-doesnt-their-tone |title= Fuse is fuel for fury.

====2008–2011====
In 2008, Fuse became the exclusive television partner for some major music events, including signing a three-year deal to air the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.multichannel.com/article/135315-Fuse_Gets_Rock_Hall_of_Fame_Telecasts_In_Three_Year_Deal.php |title=Fuse Gets Rock Hall of Fame Telecasts In Three-Year Deal - 2008-11-03 06:00:00 &#124; Multichannel News |publisher=Multichannel.com |accessdate=2010-06-25}}</ref> and the [[Bonnaroo Music and Arts Festival]]. Fuse also works with the [[Van's Warped Tour]], [[Voodoo Experience]], and [[Lollapalooza]], airing interviews and live news from the festivals. The same year, as part of a corporate reorganization, Cablevision moved Fuse from its [[Rainbow Media]] division to its [[The Madison Square Garden Company|Madison Square Garden]] unit – aligning it with a group of co-owned music venues across New York City. In 2009, Fuse debuted a two-minute music news program called ''The Daily Noise'' which is updated courtesy of ''[[Billboard Magazine]]''.

In April 2010, Cablevision's MSG unit, including Fuse, was spun off as a separate publicly traded company, [[The Madison Square Garden Company]].<ref name=bloomberg-msgspinoff>{{cite news|last=Riddell|first=Kelly|title=Cablevision Spins Off MSG to Focus on Cable Franchise|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=aUfjsSRs6HNw|publisher=Bloomberg|accessdate=18 January 2013|date=2010-02-10}}</ref>

On June 20, 2010, Fuse simulcast the [[2010 MuchMusic Video Awards]], marking its first broadcast of MuchMusic programming since its relaunch as Fuse.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ctvmedia.ca/muchmusic/releases/release.asp?id=12635 |title=CTV Media Site – MuchMusic |publisher=Ctvmedia.ca |date=2010-06-08 |accessdate=2010-06-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719081356/http://www.ctvmedia.ca/muchmusic/releases/release.asp?id=12635 |archive-date=2011-07-19 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Other MuchMusic programming would return in 2011, including ''[[The Wedge (Canadian TV series)|The Wedge]]'' and ''[[Video on Trial]]'' (which would also gain an American version).

[[Blink-182]] and former [[+44 (band)|+44]] singer/bassist [[Mark Hoppus]] began hosting his own weekly television series on Fuse that year, titled ''[[Hoppus on Music]]''.<ref name="fusenews">{{cite web|url=http://fuse.tv/ontv/shows/a-different-spin/|title=Coming to Fuse This Fall: A Different Spin with Mark Hoppus|publisher=Fuse.tv|date=2010-06-22|accessdate=2010-06-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100625042833/http://fuse.tv/ontv/shows/a-different-spin/|archive-date=2010-06-25|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name="press">{{cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/fuse-announces-new-weekly-show-a-different-spin-with-mark-hoppus-96907219.html|title=Fuse Announces New Weekly Show 'Hoppus on Music'|publisher=PR Newswire|date=2010-06-22|accessdate=2010-06-22}}</ref> The show has featured a star-studded lineup of guests, including [[Alice Cooper]], [[Rob Zombie]], [[Foo Fighters]], [[Kid Rock]], [[Linkin Park]], [[Snoop Dogg]], [[Phil Collins]], [[Ben Folds]], [[Kid Cudi]], [[Angels and Airwaves]], [[Simple Plan]] and [[Ozzy Osbourne]].

On June 28, 2011, [[Vevo]] and Fuse entered into a video syndication and content partnership. As part of the partnership, Fuse.tv syndicates Vevo's music video and entertainment programming, including exclusive music video premieres, live music events, and originally produced series.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://fuse.tv/global/vevo-press-release.html |title=VEVO Press Release Media Site – Fuse |publisher=Fuse.tv |date=2011-06-28 |accessdate=2011-07-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930012254/http://fuse.tv/global/vevo-press-release.html |archive-date=2011-09-30 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Through its ''Fuse Presents'' series, the network has also presented live concerts from various venues, primarily from those owned by MSG. These have included:

* July 25, 2008: [[Fall Out Boy]] live from the [[Chicago Theatre]]
* June 1, 2009: [[Dave Matthews Band]] live from the [[Beacon Theatre (New York City)|Beacon Theatre]]
* September 11, 2009: [[Jay-Z]] concert live from [[Madison Square Garden]].

====2012–2014====
In the fall of 2012, Fuse refocused itself with a new on-air branding campaign<ref>[http://www.loyalkaspar.com/project/fuse-rebrand/ ]</ref> created by design agency LoyalKaspar, and focused more of its website, fuse.tv, on trending music news stories. During music video programming, the channel runs a ticker which features the latest news stories from Fuse News and [[Twitter]]. That winter, Fuse launched a [[mobile app]] for [[Android (operating system)|Android]] and [[iOS]] devices. In November 2012, Fuse announced the launch of ''Fuse News'',<ref>{{cite news |url=http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/09/04/fuse-introduces-fuse-news-with-some-recognizable-hosts/ |title= Fuse Introduces 'Fuse News,' with Some Recognizable Hosts |work= The New York Times |first=Dave |last= Itzkoff |date= September 4, 2012 |accessdate= 2013-12-18}}</ref> a daily news update program which debuted in February 2013, along with additional newsworthy programming including ''Trending 10''. The channel continues to focus on music but has also diversified with [[reality shows]] such as ''Off Beat'' and ''Ex-wives of Rock''. ''Top 100 Playlist'' aired in 2012 presenting various artists and bands.

In March 2013, anonymous sources leaked news that MSG was planning to sell all or part of Fuse, as the network had been struggling, and was facing growing competition from digital outlets such as [[Vevo]].<ref>{{cite news |last= Atkinson |first= Claire |url= https://nypost.com/2013/03/22/msg-could-be-at-the-end-of-its-fuse/ |title= MSG could be at the end of its Fuse |newspaper= The New York Post |date=2013-03-22 |accessdate= 2013-12-18}}</ref>

On April 4, 2014, MSG and SiTV Media, the parent company of the Latino-oriented entertainment network [[NuvoTV]], announced that SiTV would acquire Fuse for $226 million.<ref>{{cite press release |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title= NUVOtv Parent Company SiTV Media to Acquire Fuse Network From The Madison Square Garden Company |url= https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2014/04/04/624629/10075477/en/NUVOtv-Parent-Company-SiTV-Media-to-Acquire-Fuse-Network-From-The-Madison-Square-Garden-Company.html  |location= New York, NY |publisher= MSG Networks Inc. |date= 2014-04-14 |access-date=2019-11-25}}</ref> SiTV outbid Revolt, who had made a $200 million offer to acquire Fuse. As part of the deal, the Madison Square Garden Company would take a 15% stake in SiTV. Prior to the official announcement, [[Benny Medina]] (manager of [[Jennifer Lopez]], the network's chief creative officer) stated that if SiTV were to acquire Fuse, there were no immediate plans to make any major changes to the network's programming, emphasizing that Fuse and NuvoTV would be "two different companies with two different identities, audiences and goals."<ref name="deadline1">{{cite web |first= David |last=Liberman |url= https://www.deadline.com/2014/04/parent-of-jennifer-lopez-nuvotv-agrees-to-buy-fuse-from-msg/ |title= JLo Outbids Sean Combs for Fuse TV; Snaps Up for $226 million |website=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |date= April 2014 |accessdate= 2014-04-05}}</ref> However, on May 1, ''Fuse News'' was cancelled with immediate effect, with the entire staff let go, along with other cuts throughout the network.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.mediabistro.com/tvnewser/the-ticker-fuse-daytime-emmys-tapper_b223494|title=The Ticker: Fuse, Oliver, Tapper |last=Charlton|first=Jordan|date=1 May 2014|publisher=[[TVNewser]]|accessdate=2 May 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.deadline.com/2014/05/fuse-nuvotv-merger-msg-merger-layoffs-jennifer-lopez/ |title=Fuse Readies For NuvoTV Merger By Shedding Some Staff |last=Staff|first=Report|date=1 May 2014|website=Deadline Hollywood |accessdate=2 May 2014}}</ref>

Towards the end of 2018, both [[Comcast]] and [[Verizon]] announced that Fuse and FM would be dropped from [[Xfinity]] and [[Verizon Fios|Fios]] on January 1, 2019, reasoning that the networks' lack of viewership and Fuse's channel drift towards a sitcom and film repeat-heavy lineup did not justify continued carriage of the networks. Then-Fuse Media CEO Michael Schwimmer made the claim the networks were being dropped as Comcast's [[Department of Justice]] consent decree for their acquisition was relaxed regarding channel diversity and a commitment to independent channel operators, giving them an out from carrying the network. In reality, the decree remains in full effect and Fuse's ''de facto'' replacement, [[TV One (U.S. TV network)|TV One]] sister network [[Cleo TV]], launched broadly on Comcast systems on January 19 under the same decree.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.multichannel.com/news/fuse-dropped-by-comcast-blasts-operator|title=Fuse, Dropped by Comcast, Blasts Operator|last=Lafayette|first=John|date=31 December 2018|work=[[MultiChannel News]]|accessdate=1 January 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite press release|title=TV One Launches New Entertainment Network CLEO TV on January 19, 2019|publisher=TV Week|date=21 November 2018|url=https://www.tvweek.com/in-depth/2018/11/tv-one-launches-new-entertainment-network-cleo-tv-on-january-19-2019/|accessdate=1 January 2019}}</ref>

In April 2019, Fuse's parent company, Fuse Media, filed for [[Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection]], citing its lost coverage on Comcast and Verizon systems, as well as defaulting on a loan.<ref>{{cite news|title=Jennifer Lopez-Owned Fuse Media Files For Chapter 11 Bankruptcy Protection|publisher=Deadline|date=23 April 2019|url=https://deadline.com/2019/04/jennifer-lopez-owned-fuse-media-files-for-chapter-11-bankruptcy-protection-1202600336/|accessdate=25 April 2019}}</ref>
