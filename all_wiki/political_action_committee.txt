In the [[United States]], a '''political action committee''' ('''PAC''') is a [[527 organization]] that pools campaign contributions from members and donates those funds to [[political campaign|campaigns]] for or against candidates, [[Ballot initiative#United States|ballot initiatives]], or [[legislation]].<ref>{{Cite book |last=Janda |first=Kenneth |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KZEDnrzMHFIC&pg=PA309 |title=The Challenge of Democracy: American Government in a Global World |last2=Berry |first2=Jeffrey M. |last3=Goldman |first3=Jerry |date=2008-12-19 |publisher=Cengage Learning |isbn=978-0547204543 |edition=10th |location=[[Boston]] |page=309 |access-date=2013-05-13}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=2010-12-20 |title=Civics Glossary |url=http://www.sos.ky.gov/kids/civics/glossary.htm |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130607160220/http://www.sos.ky.gov/kids/civics/glossary.htm |archive-date=2013-06-07 |access-date=2012-01-04 |website=Kentucky Secretary of State}}</ref> 
The legal term PAC has been created in pursuit of [[campaign finance reform in the United States]]. This term is quite specific to all activities of [[campaign finance in the United States]]. Democracies of other countries use different terms for the units of campaign spending or spending on political competition (see [[political finance]]). At the U.S. federal level, an organization becomes a PAC when it receives or spends more than $1,000 for the purpose of influencing a federal election, and registers with the [[Federal Election Commission]] (FEC), according to the [[Federal Election Campaign Act]] as amended by the [[Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act]] of 2002 (also known as the McCain-Feingold Act).<ref>{{USC|52|30101}}{{Cite web |title=&#91;USC02&#93; 52 USC 30101: Definitions |url=http://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title52-section30101&num=0&edition=prelim |access-date=2017-06-03}}</ref> At the state level, an organization becomes a PAC according to the state's [[election law]]s.

Contributions from corporate or labor union treasuries are illegal, though they may sponsor a PAC and provide financial support for its administration and fundraising. Union-affiliated PACs may only solicit contributions from members. Independent PACs may solicit contributions from the general public and must pay their own costs from those funds.<ref>{{Cite web |date=May 2008 |title=FEC Campaign Guide for Nonconnected Committees |url=https://www.fec.gov/resources/cms-content/documents/nongui.pdf |website=Federal Election Committee}}</ref>

==Overview==
Federal multi-candidate PACs may contribute to candidates as follows:
* $5,000 to a candidate or candidate committee for each election (primary and general elections count as separate elections);
* $15,000 to a political party per year; and
* $5,000 to another PAC per year.
* PACs may make unlimited expenditures independently of a candidate or political party

In its 2010 case ''[[Citizens United v. FEC]]'', the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] overturned sections of the [[Campaign Reform Act of 2002]] (also known as the McCain-Feingold Act) that had prohibited corporate and union political independent expenditures in political campaigns.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Ely, Jr. |first=James W. |title=The Oxford Companion to the Supreme Court of the United States |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |year=2012 |isbn=9780199916467 |editor-last=Hall |editor-first=Kermit L. |editor-link=Kermit L.

==Categorization==
{{further|List of political action committees}}
Federal law formally allows for two types of PACs: connected and non-connected.  Judicial decisions added a third classification, independent expenditure-only committees, which are colloquially known as "Super PACs".

===Connected PACs===
Most of the 4,600 active, registered PACs, named "connected PACs", sometimes also called "corporate PACs", are established by businesses, non-profits, labor unions, trade groups, or health organizations. These PACs receive and raise money from a "restricted class", generally consisting of managers and shareholders in the case of a corporation or members in the case of a non-profit organization, labor union or other interest group. As of January 2009, there were 1,598 registered corporate PACs, 272 related to labor unions and 995 to trade organizations.<ref name="FEC">{{Cite web |date=March 9, 2009 |title=Number of Federal PACs Increases |url=http://www.fec.gov/press/press2009/20090309PACcount.shtml |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303221753/http://www.fec.gov/press/press2009/20090309PACcount.shtml |archive-date=3 March 2016 |access-date=13 January 2016 |website=Federal Election Commission}}</ref>

===Non-connected PACs===
Groups with an ideological mission, single-issue groups, and members of Congress and other political leaders may form "non-connected PACs". These organizations may accept funds from any individual, connected PAC, or organization. As of January 2009, there were 1,594 non-connected PACs, the fastest-growing category.<ref name=FEC/>

===Leadership PACs===
Elected officials and political parties cannot give more than the federal limit directly to candidates. However, they can set up a Leadership PAC that makes [[independent expenditure]]s. Provided the expenditure is not coordinated with the other candidate, this type of spending is not limited.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Kurtzleben |first=Danielle |date=September 27, 2010 |title=DeMint's PAC Spends $1.5 Million in Independent Expenditures |url=http://politics.usnews.com/news/articles/2010/09/27/demints-pac-spends-15-million-in-independent-expenditures.html |website=[[U.S. News & World Report]]}}</ref>

Under the FEC (Federal Election Commission) rules, leadership PACs are non-connected PACs, and can accept donations from individuals and other PACs. Since current officeholders have an easier time attracting contributions, Leadership PACs are a way dominant parties can capture seats from other parties. A leadership PAC sponsored by an elected official cannot use funds to support that official's own campaign.  However, it may fund travel, administrative expenses, consultants, polling, and other non-campaign expenses.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Stern |first=Marcus |last2=LaFleur |first2=Jennifer |date=September 26, 2009 |title=Leadership PACs: Let the Good Times Roll |url=https://www.propublica.org/feature/leadership-pacs-let-the-good-times-roll-925 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091220011916/http://www.propublica.org/feature/leadership-pacs-let-the-good-times-roll-925 |archive-date=December 20, 2009 |access-date=December 10, 2009 |website=[[ProPublica]]}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Leadership PACs and Sponsors |url=http://www.fec.gov/data/Leadership.do?format=html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310000223/http://www.fec.gov/data/Leadership.do?format=html |archive-date=2012-03-10 |website=Federal Election Commission}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Congress 101: Political Action Committees (PAC) |url=http://corporate.cqrollcall.com/wmspage.cfm?parm1=233 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708200810/http://corporate.cqrollcall.com/wmspage.cfm?parm1=233 |archive-date=2011-07-08 |website=[[Congressional Quarterly|CQ's]] Congress A to Z Online Edition}}</ref>

In the 2018 election cycle, leadership PACs donated more than $67 million to federal candidates.<ref>{{Cite web |year=2018 |title=Leadership PACs |url=http://www.opensecrets.org/pacs/industry.php?txt=Q03&cycle=2018 |access-date=2019-12-27 |website=OpenSecrets.org |publisher=Center for Responsive Politics}}</ref>

====Controversial use of leadership PACs====
* Former Rep. [[John Doolittle]]'s (R) leadership PAC paid 15% to a firm that employed only his wife.  Payouts to his wife's firm were $68,630 in 2003 and 2004, and $224,000 in 2005 and 2006. The Doolittle home was raided in 2007.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Seidman |first=Joel |date=April 19, 2007 |title=FBI raids U.S. Rep.

* One Leadership PAC purchased $2,139 in gifts from [[Bose Corporation]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Political Action Committees |url=http://www.opensecrets.org/pacs/expend.asp?strID=C00317511&Cycle=2006 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080318122110/http://www.opensecrets.org/pacs/expend.asp?strID=C00317511&Cycle=2006 |archive-date=2008-03-18 |access-date=2012-01-04 |website=OpenSecrets.org |publisher=Center for Responsive Politics}}</ref>

===Super PACs===
{{split section|Super PAC|date=February 2020|discuss=Talk:Political action committee#Proposed merge with Hybrid PAC}}
Super PACs, officially known as "independent expenditure-only political action committees," may engage in unlimited political spending (on, for example, ads) independently of the campaigns, but are not allowed to either coordinate or make contributions to candidate campaigns or party coffers. Unlike traditional PACs, Super PACs can raise funds from individuals, corporations, unions, and other groups without any legal limit on donation size.<ref name="opensecret">{{Cite web |title=Outside Spending (2010) |url=http://www.opensecrets.org/outsidespending/index.php |website=OpenSecrets.org |publisher=Center for Responsive Politics}}</ref>

Super PACs were made possible by two judicial decisions in 2010: the aforementioned ''[[Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission]]'' and, two months later, ''Speechnow.org v. FEC''. In ''Speechnow.org'', the federal [[Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit]] held that PACs that did not make contributions to candidates, parties, or other PACs could accept unlimited contributions from individuals, unions, and corporations (both for profit and not-for-profit) for the purpose of making independent expenditures.

The result of the ''Citizens United'' and ''SpeechNow.org'' decisions was the rise of a new type of political action committee in 2010, popularly dubbed the "super PAC".<ref>{{Cite news |last=Cordes |first=Nancy |author-link=Nancy Cordes |date=June 30, 2011 |title=Colbert gets a Super PAC; So what are they? |work=[[CBS News]] |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2011/06/30/eveningnews/main20075941.shtml |access-date=2011-08-11}}</ref> In an open meeting on July 22, 2010, the FEC approved two Advisory Opinions to modify FEC policy in accordance with the legal decisions.<ref>{{Cite web |date=July 22, 2010 |title=FEC Approves Two Advisory Opinions On Independent Expenditure-Only Political Committees |url=http://www.fec.gov/press/press2010/20100722OpenMtng.shtml |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304035832/http://www.fec.gov/press/press2010/20100722OpenMtng.shtml |archive-date=4 March 2016 |access-date=13 January 2016 |website=FEC}}</ref> These Advisory Opinions were issued in response to requests from two existing PACs, the conservative [[Club for Growth]], and the liberal Commonsense Ten (later renamed Senate Majority PAC). Their advisory opinions gave a sample wording letter which all Super PACs must submit to qualify for the deregulated status, and such letters continue to be used by Super PACs up to the present date. FEC Chairman [[Steven T. Walther]] dissented on both opinions and issued a statement giving his thoughts. In the statement, Walther stated "There are provisions of the Act and Commission regulations ''not addressed by the court in SpeechNow'' that continue to prohibit Commonsense Ten from soliciting or accepting contributions from political committees in excess of $5,000 annually or any contributions from corporations or labor organizations" (emphasis in original).<ref>{{Cite web |date=July 20, 2010 |title=Advisory Opinion: Statement of Commissioner Steven T. Walther |url=http://saos.fec.gov/aodocs/1144645.pdf |website=FEC}}</ref>

The term "Super PAC" was coined by reporter Eliza Newlin Carney.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Corley |first=Matt |date=March 14, 2012 |title=Political Scientist Morris Fiorina Used The Term Super PAC In 2002 |url=http://mattcorley.wordpress.com/2012/03/14/morris-fiorina-super-pac-2002/ |website=Component Parts}}</ref> According to ''Politico'', Carney, a staff writer covering lobbying and influence for ''[[CQ Roll Call]]'', "made the first identifiable, published reference to 'super PAC' as it's known today while working at ''[[National Journal]]'', writing on June 26, 2010, of a group called Workers' Voices, that it was a kind of {{"'}}super PAC' that could become increasingly popular in the post-Citizens United world."<ref>{{Cite web |last=Levinthal |first=Dave |date=January 10, 2012 |title=Genesis of a super name |url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0112/71285.html |website=Politico}}</ref>

According to FEC [[Advisory opinion|advisories]], Super PACs are not allowed to coordinate directly with candidates or political parties. This restriction is intended to prevent them from operating campaigns that complement or parallel those of the candidates they support or engaging in negotiations that could result in ''[[quid pro quo]]'' bargaining between donors to the PAC and the candidate or officeholder. However, it is legal for candidates and Super PAC managers to discuss campaign strategy and tactics through the media.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Grier |first=Peter |date=January 18, 2012 |title=Will Jon Stewart go to jail for running Stephen Colbert's super PAC? |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Elections/Vox-News/2012/0118/Will-Jon-Stewart-go-to-jail-for-running-Stephen-Colbert-s-super-PAC |newspaper=The Christian Science Monitor}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=McGlynn |first=Katla |date=January 18, 2012 |title=Jon Stewart, Stephen Colbert Expose More Super PAC Loopholes Without 'Coordinating' |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/01/18/jon-stewart-stephen-colbert-expose-super-pac-loopholes_n_1212670.html |website=The Huffington Post}}</ref>

====2012 presidential election====
Super PACs may support particular candidacies. In the 2012 presidential election, Super PACs played a major role, spending more than the candidates' election campaigns in the Republican primaries.<ref name="crankocracy">{{Cite magazine |last=Noah |first=Timothy |date=29 March 2012 |title=Crankocracy In America.

In the 2012 election campaign, most of the money given to super PACs came from wealthy individuals, not corporations.<ref name=crankocracy /> According to data from the [[Center for Responsive Politics]], the top 100 individual super PAC donors in 2011â€“2012 made up just 3.7% of contributors, but accounted for more than 80% of the total money raised,<ref>{{Cite web |last=Riley |first=Charles |date=March 26, 2012 |title=Can 46 rich dudes buy an election? |url=https://money.cnn.com/2012/03/26/news/economy/super-pac-donors/index.htm |website=CNN Money}}</ref> while less than 0.5% of the money given to "the most active Super PACs" was donated by [[Public company|publicly traded corporations]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Palmer |first=Anna |last2=Phillip |first2=Abby |date=2012-08-03 |title=Corporations don't pony up for super PACs |url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0312/73804.html |website=Politico}}</ref>

As of February 2012, according to Center for Responsive Politics, 313 groups organized as Super PACs had received $98,650,993 and spent $46,191,479.  This means early in the 2012 election cycle, PACs had already greatly exceeded total receipts of 2008.  The leading Super PAC on its own raised more money than the combined total spent by the top 9 PACS in the 2008 cycle.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Super PACs |url=http://www.opensecrets.org/pacs/superpacs.php?ql3 |access-date=2012-02-04 |website=OpenSecrets.org |publisher=Center for Responsive Politics}}</ref>

Super PACs have been criticized for relying heavily on negative ads.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Mooney |first=Brian C. |date=February 2, 2012 |title=Super PACs fueling GOP attack ads |work=The Boston Globe |url=http://articles.boston.com/2012-02-02/news/31018056_1_super-pacs-negative-ads-newt-gingrich |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120609033911/http://articles.boston.com/2012-02-02/news/31018056_1_super-pacs-negative-ads-newt-gingrich |archive-date=2012-06-09}}</ref>

By January 2010, at least 38 states and the federal government required  [[election law|disclosure]] for all or some independent expenditures or [[Political campaign|electioneering]] communications.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Unknown |url=http://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1082&context=ylsspps_papers |url-access=registration |access-date=13 January 2016 |website=Yale Law School}}</ref> These disclosures were intended to deter potentially or seemingly corrupting [[Campaign finance|donations]].<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Briffault |first=Richard |year=2010 |title=Campaign Finance Disclosure 2.0 |journal=Election Law Journal: Rules, Politics, and Policy |volume=9 |issue=4 |pages=273â€“303 |doi=10.1089/elj.2010.9408}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Krishnakumar |first=Anita S. |date=February 18, 2007 |title=Towards a Madisonian, interest-group-based, approach to lobbying regulation |url=http://www.law.ua.edu/pubs/lrarticles/Volume%2058/Issue%203/krishnakumar.pdf |website=University of Alabama School of Law |page=10}}</ref>
