'''Enigma''' is a [[concert residency]] held at the [[Park Theater (Las Vegas)|Park Theater]], [[Park MGM]] in [[Las Vegas]], United States, by American singer and songwriter [[Lady Gaga]]. The residency consists of two types of shows: Enigma, which focuses on theatricality and includes the singer's biggest hits, and Jazz and Piano, which involves songs from the [[Great American Songbook]] and stripped-down versions of Gaga's songs. The Enigma residency show opened on December 28, 2018, and the Jazz and Piano show opened on January 20, 2019. It was praised by critics, and became the highest grossing Las Vegas concert residency of 2019. With Enigma's gross, Gaga also became the fifth woman to pass the half-billion career total as per ''Billboard'' Boxscore.

The singer released a promotional poster accompanying the announcement, colored in [[Day-Glo Color Corp.|day-glo]] paint. She wore a neon green [[Tulle (netting)|tulle]] dress by designers Laurence & Chico, and latex gloves and swim cap from Vex Clothing. The image was photographed by [[Inez and Vinoodh]] and styled by Gaga's longtime collaborator [[Nicola Formichetti]]. Matt Moen from ''[[Paper (magazine)|Paper]]'' felt that the poster hearkened back to Gaga's fashion choices during ''[[The Fame Monster]]'' (2009) era, suggesting the singer's return to avant-garde looks. He also found Las Vegas [[Electronic dance music|EDM]] and [[rave]] influences in the poster, likening it to an [[Electric Daisy Carnival]].<ref name="paper">{{cite magazine|url=http://www.papermag.com/lady-gaga-formichetti-enigma-look-2593726973.html|title=Lady Gaga Is a Day-Glo Fantasy in 'Enigma' Poster|last=Moen|first=Matt|date=August 7, 2018|accessdate=August 7, 2018|magazine=Paper|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180808180653/http://www.papermag.com/lady-gaga-formichetti-enigma-look-2593726973.html|archivedate=August 8, 2018}}</ref> Formichetti also worked on creating the costumes for the concert series.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.out.com/fashion/2018/11/13/lady-gagas-creative-director-gives-advice-young-people-fashion|title=Lady Gaga's Creative Director Gives His Best Advice for Young People in the Fashion Industry|last=Mercado|first=Jillian|date=November 13, 2018|accessdate=November 14, 2018|work=[[Out (magazine)|Out]]}}</ref> On December 4, 2018, Gaga shared a video from the rehearsal on her Instagram account showing her in a bodysuit with dots on it, utilizing [[motion capture]] while the song "[[Aura (song)|Aura]]" played in the background.<ref name="bbaura">{{cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/8488088/lady-gaga-shares-behind-the-scenes-clip-enigma-reharsal|title=Lady Gaga Shares Behind-the-Scenes Clip From 'Enigma' Rehearsals: Watch|last=Reitman|first=Shelby|date=December 4, 2018|accessdate=December 6, 2018|magazine=Billboard}}</ref> She also assumed a titular new identity in one of the videos, referring herself as Enigma.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://uproxx.com/music/lady-gaga-enigma-alter-ego-las-vegas/|title=Lady Gaga Teases A New Alter Ego Called 'Enigma' Ahead Of Her Las Vegas Residency|last=Rossignol|first=Derrick|date=December 11, 2018|accessdate=December 17, 2018|website=[[Uproxx]]}}</ref>

== Concert synopsis ==
=== Enigma ===
[[File:Lady Gaga Enigma during "The Fame" (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|left|Gaga performing her song "The Fame"]]
The show starts with an introduction where Enigma, a [[motion capture]]d character who is Gaga's [[alter ego]], welcomes the crowd. Shortly after, the singer appears suspended to the roof of the theater and performs "[[Just Dance (song)|Just Dance"]] as she plays the [[keytar]]. After joining the stage, Gaga and her dancers perform "[[Poker Face (Lady Gaga song)|Poker Face]]" and "[[LoveGame]]". Then, she meets Enigma, who explains her who she is and that she's going to show Gaga the future through a simulation. After an interlude, the singer returns on stage wearing a fluorescent suit and a manga inspired wig, and performs "[[Dance in the Dark]]" and "[[Beautiful, Dirty, Rich]]". Gaga takes her jacket off and plays an instrument which includes a keyboard and guitar strings, while singing "The Fame". After performing "[[Telephone (song)|Telephone]]" and "[[Applause (Lady Gaga song)|Applause]]", Gaga realizes that in the simulation, paparazzi are dangerous and want to capture her. She performs "[[Paparazzi (Lady Gaga song)|Paparazzi]]" up in the air in an orb-like cage, but quickly after, the paparazzi catch her and she performs "[[Aura (song)|Aura]]" while they torture her.

[[File:Lady Gaga Enigma Bad Romance.jpg|thumb|upright|Gaga performing "[[Bad Romance]]" in a latex suit]]
The third act opens with Gaga riding a giant mechanical robot, wearing a light-up catsuit by futuristic designer [[Asher Levine]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vogue.com/article/lady-gaga-asher-levine-enigma-tour-costumes|title=Meet the Designer Behind Lady Gaga’s Mesmerizing Sci-Fi Costumes|last=Bowles|first=Hamish|website=[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]|date=January 14, 2019|accessdate=October 27, 2019}}</ref> while singing "[[Scheiße (song)|Scheiße]]". Pyrotechnic effects accompany the performance. The song transitions to "[[Judas (Lady Gaga song)|Judas]]", in which Gaga performs a long electric guitar solo. Later she performs "[[Government Hooker]]" with changed lyrics to address the current US administration.<ref>{{cite news|last=Barlow|first=Eve|title=A Star Is Born Again: Lady Gaga’s Vegas Residency Dazzles|url=https://www.vulture.com/2018/12/lady-gagas-vegas-residency-reviewed.html|accessdate=December 1, 2019|work=[[New York (magazine)#Digital expansion and blogs|Vulture.com]]|date=December 30, 2018}}</ref> After that, Gaga covers [[David Bowie]]'s "[[I'm Afraid of Americans]]" while standing  in a circular keyboard console.

Following an interlude in which Enigma explains to Gaga that she must heal, "[[The Edge of Glory]]" and "[[Alejandro (song)|Alejandro]]" are performed. Gaga sits down at piano at the end of the catwalk to sing "[[Million Reasons]]" and "[[You and I (Lady Gaga song)|You and I]]", where she is joined by her guitarists. The last act opens with "[[Bad Romance]]", performed in a cream latex suit on the catwalk while Gaga's dancers execute the choreography on the main stage. Enigma tells Gaga it is now time for her to leave, but Gaga insists to perform for her one last time. "[[Born This Way (song)|Born This Way]]" follows, and after Gaga and her crew leave the stage, she comes back to sing "[[Shallow (Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper song)|Shallow]]" on her piano as the encore.

=== Jazz and Piano ===
The singer's Jazz and Piano engagement does not involve a comprehensive narrative as the Enigma show, but it is divided into four segments, each of them preceded by costume change and black-and-white interlude films. In the videos, Gaga talks about her love of Jazz and American classics, and gives shout outs to performers who inspired her, including [[Billie Holiday]], [[Etta James]] and [[Dinah Washington]].<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Sheckells|first=Melinda|title=Lady Gaga Kicks Off Jazz & Piano Engagements With Classic Las Vegas Vibes, Support From Tony Bennett|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/8494270/lady-gaga-jazz-piano-las-vegas-tony-bennett-review|accessdate=February 10, 2019|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=January 21, 2019}}</ref>

Chris Willman from ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' called the Enigma show a "back-to-roots move for the superstar", as it focused on her "art and artifice of being spectacular", and complimented Gaga for singing live for the entirety of the two hours.<ref>{{cite news|last=Willman|first=Chris|title=Concert Review: Lady Gaga Kicks Off a Very Good Romance With Vegas|url=https://variety.com/2018/film/news/review-lady-gaga-las-vegas-residency-opening-1203096661/|accessdate=January 23, 2019|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=December 29, 2018}}</ref> Mark Gray from ''[[People (magazine)|People]]'' thought that the show was "highly energetic", which "lived up to the hype", and praised the theatricality of the show and the singer's connection with the audience.<ref>{{cite news|last=Gray|first=Mark|title=Lady Gaga Kicks Off Las Vegas Residency with Star-Studded Affair — Including Katy Perry!|url=https://people.com/music/lady-gaga-begins-las-vegas-residency-enigma/|accessdate=January 23, 2019|work=[[People (magazine)|People]]|date=December 29, 2018}}</ref> Andreas Hale from ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' thought that the "set pieces were just as grandiose and over-the-top as the performances themselves" and the outfits were "outrageously unique". At the end of his review, he concluded that "it was obvious that Gaga was more than comfortable on the Vegas stage where many all-time greats cut their teeth. Simply put, she was born to do this."<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Hale|first=Andreas|title=Lady Gaga Delivers the Show She Was Born to Perform With 'Enigma'|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/8491731/lady-gaga-enigma-opening-night-review|accessdate=January 23, 2019|magazine=Billboard|date=December 29, 2018}}</ref> John Katsilometes, from the ''[[Las Vegas Review-Journal]]'' praised the singer's vocal and piano skills, saying that "she is dazzling dancing around the stage, a slim figure in a mirrored one-piece to open the night, but her heartfelt playing on the keyboards shows she can move a crowd subtly, too."<ref>{{cite news|last=Katsilometes|first=John|title=Lady Gaga opens Las Vegas Strip residency to sold-out crowd|url=https://www.reviewjournal.com/entertainment/entertainment-columns/kats/lady-gaga-opens-las-vegas-strip-residency-to-sold-out-crowd-1561552/|accessdate=January 24, 2019|work=[[Las Vegas Review-Journal]]|date=December 29, 2018}}</ref> Writing for ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', Brittany Spanos highlighted the variety of the setlist and the use of props, while saying that "the best moments are the ones that feel improvised".

Randy Lewis from the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' thought that Gaga was "in full pop star mode", and while he appreciated the "gigantic" set pieces and the inclusion of the singer's biggest hits, he found the show "disjointed", with "little sense of narrative flow". He also added that the choreography "offers little in the way of physical expression or amplification of her songs’ lyrics or music", although he noted that it showcased "plenty of wild, kinetic energy".<ref>{{cite news|last=Lewis|first=Randy|title=Commentary: A pop star is reborn: Lady Gaga introduces Las Vegas to her new show Enigma|url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/music/la-et-ms-lady-gaga-las-vegas-20181220-story.html|accessdate=January 23, 2019|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=December 30, 2018}}</ref> ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' journalist Marc Snetiker called the show "on the whole, rather nutty, (...) but Enigma the show is a damn good time, and it’s admirable in its attempts to elevate a greatest-hits gathering into something striving for more, something that perhaps even galvanized an artist in the peak of her career to take a Vegas residency in the first place."<ref>{{cite news|last=Snetiker|first=Marc|title=In Vegas, a weird, wonderful Lady Gaga is reborn|url=https://ew.com/concerts/2018/12/29/lady-gaga-vegas-enigma-review/|accessdate=January 24, 2019|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=December 29, 2018}}</ref>

=== Jazz and Piano ===
[[File:Lady Gaga Jazz & Piano 3.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Gaga performing during one of the Jazz & Piano shows]]
''Variety'' magazine journalist Chris Willman thought that the Jazz & Piano arrangement was even better than the singer's other show, calling it "the best shot we’re going to get at (...) time travel" as "this show recalls peak Vegas", and complimented the singer"s "real emotion" showcased throughout this performance.<ref>{{cite news|last=Willman|first=Chris|title=Concert Review: Lady Gaga Outdoes Her Other Vegas Show With Masterful ‘Jazz & Piano’|url=https://variety.com/2019/music/news/lady-gaga-jazz-and-piano-las-vegas-concert-review-1203113496/|accessdate=January 23, 2019|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=January 21, 2019}}</ref> Mikael Wood from the ''Los Angeles Times'' also compared it to Enigma, saying that "for all their differences in style and repertoire, both shows feel indelibly Gaga, linked by the unifying force of her wacky personality and her raw vocal talent." He further noticed, that "for her, the two Vegas performances aren’t opposed but complementary — part of the same determination to use artifice to say something real."<ref>{{cite news|last=Wood|first=Mikael|title=Review: In Las Vegas, Lady Gaga solves the problem of 'A Star Is Born'|url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/music/la-et-ms-lady-gaga-enigma-jazz-piano-las-vegas-review-20190121-story.html|accessdate=January 23, 2019|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=January 21, 2019}}</ref>

Individual show grosses ranged from $1.41–$1.48&nbsp;million, with the total audience rounding out at 59,162 tickets. According to the magazine's Eric Frankenberg, the total gross was "an electrifying opening pace for Gaga's Vegas residency", since the singer "outperformed" the opening grosses of all previous residencies by other artists—including [[Britney Spears]], [[Jennifer Lopez]], the [[Backstreet Boys]], [[Shania Twain]] and [[Gwen Stefani]]. With the gross, Gaga also became the fifth woman to pass the half-billion career total as per ''Billboard'' Boxscore.<ref name="bbgross1">{{cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/8500242/lady-gaga-touring-earnings-pass-half-billion-mark|title=Lady Gaga's Touring Earnings Pass Half-Billion Mark as 'Enigma' Grosses Roll in|last=Frankenberg|first=Eric|date=February 27, 2019|accessdate=February 28, 2019|magazine=Billboard}}</ref> In 2019, the residency grossed $53,868,719 million for an average of $1,584,374 per concert, and  sold 185,019 tickets for an average of 5,442 per concert.
