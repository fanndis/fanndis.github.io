'''Westbury''' is an affluent [[village]] in [[Nassau County, New York|Nassau County]], [[New York (state)|New York]], United States. The population was 15,404 at the 2020 census. The '''Incorporated Village of Westbury''' is in the [[North Hempstead, New York|Town of North Hempstead]]. It is located about {{convert|18|mi|km}} east of Manhattan.

==History==
The first settlers arrived in 1658 in the region known as the [[Hempstead Plains]]. Many of the early settlers were [[Quakers]].

Westbury's [[New York State Route 25|Jericho Turnpike]], which provides connection to [[Mineola, New York|Mineola]] and [[Syosset, New York|Syosset]] as well as to the [[Interstate 495 (New York)|Long Island Expressway]] (or LIE), was once a trail used by the Massapequa Indians. As far back as the 17th century, it served as a divider between the early homesteads north of the Turnpike and the [[Great Plains]] to its south. Today, it serves as a state highway complex.

In 1657, Captain John Seaman purchased {{convert|12000|acre|km2}} from the Algonquian Tribe of the Massapequa Indians. In 1658, Richard Stites and his family built their homestead in this area.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} Theirs was the only family farm until an English Quaker, Edmond Titus, and his son Samuel joined them and settled in an area of Hempstead Plains, known today as the Village of Westbury. In 1675 Henry Willis, also an English Quaker, named the area "Westbury", after [[Westbury, Wiltshire]], his hometown in England.<ref>Richard Panchyk, ''A History of Westbury, Long Island'' (The History Press, 2007), p. 14</ref> Other Quaker families who were also seeking a place to freely express their religious beliefs joined the Tituses and Willises. The first Society of Friends meeting house was built in 1700. The early history of Westbury and that of the Friends are so interconnected that they are essentially the same.

These settlers, like many other landowners throughout the colonies, owned slaves. In 1775, compelled by their religious beliefs, the Quakers freed all 154 African-Americans that they owned. Many of these freed men and women built their own homesteads on the open land near the sheep grazing pastures. Their new community consisted of farms and dairies. In 1834, with Quaker assistance, they and their descendants built the New Light Baptist Church. In 1867 the congregation moved to 247 Grand Boulevard, and in 1892 changed their name to Westbury A.M.E. Zion Church.<ref name="Abraham" /> In 2014, the congregation celebrated its 180th anniversary.<ref name="Abraham">{{cite news |last1=Abraham |first1=Betsy |title=A.M.E.

The outbreak of the American Revolution disrupted Westbury's tranquility. From the beginning of the war until 1783, British soldiers and German-speaking mercenaries occupied local homes, confiscated livestock, and cleared the woods for firewood for the troops. With the close of the war, Westbury received its third group of settlers, the Hessians, mostly from [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel|Hesse-Cassel]] in the [[Holy Roman Empire]], who chose not to return to their home country. Instead, they remained in an area now known as [[New Cassel, New York|New Cassel]], a name chosen in honor of the part of Hesse from which most had come.<ref name=p40>Panczyk (2007), p. 40</ref>

By 1837, the [[Long Island Rail Road]] had built through Westbury. Schedules from March 1837 mention a stop at [[Westbury (LIRR station)|Westbury]], but by June list [[Carle Place (LIRR station)|Carle Place]] instead,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://arrts-arrchives.com/UCRT,TCRT2.html |title=Union Course Race track}}</ref> with schedules from 1842 listing both.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://arrts-arrchives.com/atlaverr1.html |title=Brooklyn and Jamaica RailRoad}}</ref>
In 1840, the first public school was built. The railroad made it easier for Italian and Irish immigrants to work Westbury's farms and in 1857, St. Brigid's Parish was founded.

At the same time more African-American families came to the area via the Underground Railroad. For some, Westbury was only one stop on the way to Canada, but several stayed in this area after being harbored in secret rooms in the homes of the Quakers. In the years after the Civil War, until near the turn of the century, the few stores that comprised the small village around the railroad depot, were mainly black owned.

The Village moved from its agricultural setting in the late 19th century when the very wealthy began to settle and build mansions. This area is now known as [[Old Westbury]]. Post Avenue soon became a commerce center to serve the surrounding estates. Various estate workers began to move in as well. Streets were mapped out and constructed. Post Avenue received electricity in 1902 and in 1914 a water company was founded.

From the 1850s to the 1900s, Westbury's population and ethnic diversity began to rise as many people of Irish and Italian origins continued to settle. New Cassel began to be developed in the first quarter of the 20th century.<ref name=p40/>

In 1927, Charles Lindbergh took off from Roosevelt Field, a couple of hundred yards south of downtown, for the history-making flight to Paris, marking probably the most famous event tied to Westbury.<ref>The Spirit of St. Louis, Scribner 1953, Chapter 5</ref>

In response to a rumor that northern Westbury planned to incorporate, thereby leaving the southern part without a name,{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} residents{{who|date=January 2012|reason=of where? south westbury? salisbury?}} collected enough petitions for third class{{clarify|date=January 2012}} incorporation in 1932. The Village included Grantsville, the section south of Union Avenue around A.M.E. Zion church, but did not take in New Cassel, since the few families that lived there thought it would only unnecessarily increase their taxes.

In 1938, the [[Northern State Parkway]] was constructed and in 1940, Roosevelt Raceway. In 1941, the Second World War began. Westbury sent 1,400 persons to serve the country. This was 20% of the community's population, making it the highest percentage of any comparable community in the United States.

In the mid-1950s, Westbury virtually ran out of undeveloped land and with it came the end of the building boom. In 1940, Westbury listed its population at 4,525. By 1960, Westbury's population had grown to 14,757, according to the census data for that year. Many Caribbean and Latin American families began to settle during this time and in the decades that followed.

On 8 September 1974, [[Crosby, Stills & Nash]] performed at the Roosevelt Raceway.

As the birth rate declined, people married at a later age and the high cost of buying a home prevented many people from assuming a mortgage in the 1970s, Westbury again underwent change. Becoming more urban and city like over time.

==Geography==
Westbury is located at {{coord|40.758930|-73.588173|type:city_region:US|format=dms|display=inline}}.<ref name="GR1">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref>

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the village has a total area of {{convert|2.3|sqmi|km2}}, all of it land.

In addition to Westbury Village itself, unincorporated regions surrounding its borders also use the Westbury name, including [[New Cassel, New York|New Cassel]], [[Salisbury, Nassau County, New York|Salisbury]] (South Westbury) and parts of [[Jericho, New York|Jericho]]. For example, the  [[Westbury Music Fair]] performing venue (now known as the NYCB Theatre at Westbury), located in the Westbury postal zone, is part of the Jericho hamlet.

The region is grouped under the name Greater Westbury, a region that also includes organizations with common interests, such as those in [[New Cassel, New York]]. The school districts that serve the Greater Westbury region, based on the boundaries, are Westbury (including New Cassel)(Westbury Union District) and East Meadow (Clark District). The only homes zoned for East Meadow Schools are actually located in the Hamlet of [[Salisbury, Nassau County, New York|Salisbury]], which is in the Town of Hempstead.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nyhomeshowcase.com/salisbury_new_york.htm|title=New York Home Showcase|author=|date=|website=nyhomeshowcase.com|accessdate=9 April 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.city-data.com/city/Salisbury-New-York.html|title=Salisbury, New York (NY 11590) profile: population, maps, real estate, averages, homes, statistics, relocation, travel, jobs, hospitals, schools, crime, moving, houses, news, sex offenders|author=|date=|website=www.city-data.com|accessdate=9 April 2018}}</ref>
