"'''Bad Romance'''" is a song by American singer [[Lady Gaga]] from her third extended play, ''[[The Fame Monster]]'' (2009). It was written and produced by [[RedOne|Nadir "RedOne" Khayat]] and Lady Gaga. Lyrically, "Bad Romance" explores Gaga's attraction to individuals with whom romance never works, her preference for lonely relationships and the paranoia she experienced while on tour. Following an illegal demo leak, Gaga showcased the final product at [[Alexander McQueen]]'s show at the [[Paris Fashion Week]] in October 2009, followed by the release of the single's cover art. Musically, "Bad Romance" features a spoken [[bridge (music)|bridge]], a full-throated [[chorus effect|chorus]] and sung lyrics about being in love with one's best friend. The song, which is imbued with elements of German-esque [[house music|house]] and [[techno]], as well as music from the 1980s and 1990s, was touted by Gaga as an experimental pop record. During the bridge Gaga sings a part of the chorus ("I want your love and I want your revenge") in [[French language|French]].

Most commentators praised "Bad Romance", calling it one of the highlights of the album. It was included in the 'best-of' lists in several media outlets such as ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' and [[Pitchfork Media]], and won two [[Grammy Awards]] for [[Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance|Best Female Pop Vocal Performance]] and [[Grammy Award for Best Short Form Music Video|Best Short Form Music Video]]. In the US, "Bad Romance" peaked at number two on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], and it has been certified 11-times platinum by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA), having sold 5.9&nbsp;million digital downloads as of February 2019. It topped the charts in more than 20 countries and sold 12&nbsp;million copies worldwide, becoming [[List of best-selling singles|one of the best-selling singles of all time]].

The accompanying music video of "Bad Romance" features Gaga inside a surreal white [[Public bathing|bathhouse]]. There, she gets kidnapped by a group of supermodels who drug her and sell her to the [[Russian mafia]] for [[sexual slavery]]. The video ends with Gaga burning alive the man who bought her. It garnered massive acclaim from critics, who complimented the risqué and symbolic nature of the plot, as well as its artistic direction and vivid imagery. It was chosen as the best music video of the 21st century by ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/list/8466543/100-greatest-music-videos-of-the-21st-century|title=The 100 Greatest Music Videos of the 21st Century: Critics' Picks|website=Billboard|access-date=2019-05-17}}</ref> At the [[2010 MTV Video Music Awards]], it was nominated for ten awards, where Gaga won seven, including [[MTV Video Music Award for Video of the Year|Video of the Year]].

According to Gaga, the song was one of her initial efforts among the songs that she wrote in 2009 while [[touring (band)|touring]]. The songs composed during that time were about the various abstract "monsters"—metaphors for her paranoias—that she faced during the tour. One of these concepts became the inspiration behind "Bad Romance".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/lady-gaga-explores-seamy-side-of-fame-on-monster-re-release-20091009|title=Lady Gaga Explores Seamy Side of Fame on "Monster" Re-Release|date=October 11, 2009|accessdate=September 1, 2013|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130202084703/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/lady-gaga-explores-seamy-side-of-fame-on-monster-re-release-20091009|archivedate=February 2, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/jun/11/lady-gaga-bad-romance|title=Lady Gaga writes Bad Romance on the bus|date=June 11, 2011|accessdate=September 1, 2013|last=Robinson|first=Peter|work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=Guardian News and Media|location=London|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131030001128/http://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/jun/11/lady-gaga-bad-romance|archivedate=October 30, 2013}}</ref> Gaga explained that she generally felt lonely when she was involved in a relationship and that she was attracted to men with whom romance never works.<ref name="vfair">{{cite journal|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/online/daily/2010/08/lady-gaga-september-issue|last=Robinson|first=Lisa|date=September 2010|issn=0733-8899|title=Lady Gaga On Sex, Fame, Drugs, and Her Fans|journal=Vanity Fair|page=34|accessdate=July 28, 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140713084800/http://www.vanityfair.com/online/daily/2010/08/lady-gaga-september-issue|archivedate=July 13, 2014}}</ref> "Bad Romance" explores her preference for such lonely relationships and her poor choice in men.<ref name="vfair"/> Gaga wrote the lyrics in Norway on her tour bus.

<blockquote>I was in Russia, then Germany, and spent a lot of time in Eastern Europe. There is this amazing German house-techno music, so I wanted to make a pop experimental record. I kind of wanted to leave the '80s a little bit, so the chorus is a '90s melody, which is what the inspiration was. There was certainly some whisky involved in the writing of the record.

==Critical reception==
[[File:Lady Gaga BR GMA.jpg|thumb|Gaga opening her 2011 ''[[Good Morning America]]'' set with "Bad Romance"|alt=Gaga in a red bodysuit and hood, dancing at the center flanked by her dancers.]]
"Bad Romance" received universal acclaim from music critics. In a 2011 review for the song, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' declared it  the best song in Gaga's discography.

Gaga described her experience of working with Lawrence:

<blockquote>I wanted somebody with a tremendous understanding of how to make a pop video, because my biggest challenge working with directors is that I am the director and I write the treatments and I get the fashion and I decide what it's about and it's very hard to find directors that will relinquish any sort of input from the artist ... But Francis and I worked together ... It was collaborative. He's a really pop video director and a filmmaker ... I knew he could execute the video in a way that I could give him all my weirdest, most psychotic ideas ... But it would come across to and be relevant to the public.<ref name="MTV News"/></blockquote>

The concept of the music video was a joint collaboration between Gaga and Lawrence.<ref name=mtvexplosion/> The video was initially planned to be shot in New York City, with more elaborate sets, including sets outdoors.<ref name=mtvexplosion/> This idea was later scrapped, as the budget for the video was low and there was no product placement.<ref name=mtvexplosion/> Because of Gaga's schedule, it was shot in Los Angeles over a two-day period.<ref name="mtvexplosion">{{cite web|last1=Rosenberg|first1=Adam|title=Lady Gaga's 'Bad Romance' Director Recalls Video's 'Explosion'|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1647757/lady-gagas-bad-romance-director-recalls-videos-explosion/|publisher=MTV News|accessdate=April 3, 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170713164245/http://www.mtv.com/news/1647757/lady-gagas-bad-romance-director-recalls-videos-explosion/|archivedate=July 13, 2017}}</ref> Lawrence described Gaga's work ethic and creativity during the video shoot: "She loves the art form of music videos and she is a real creative partner and has great ideas and really cool and unique tastes."

===Synopsis===
[[File:Gagabadromancevideo.jpg|thumb|left|Gaga's choreography from "Bad Romance" drew comparisons to the choreography from ''[[Michael Jackson's Thriller (music video)|Michael Jackson's Thriller]].'']]
The main idea behind the video is that of Gaga getting kidnapped by a group of supermodels who drug her and then sell her off to the [[Russian mafia]] for a million [[Russian ruble|ruble]]s. It takes place in a fluorescent white bathhouse.<ref name="MTV News"/><ref name="fans">{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1625978/20091110/lady_gaga.jhtml|title=Lady Gaga Fans React To 'Bad Romance' Video|last=Dinh|first=James|date=November 11, 2009|publisher=MTV (MTV Networks)|accessdate=November 11, 2009|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091114060711/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1625978/20091110/lady_gaga.jhtml|archivedate=November 14, 2009}}</ref> The video begins with Gaga sitting on a white throne in a brightly-lit white room with [[Johann Sebastian Bach]]'s Fugue No. 24 from [[WTC (Bach)|WTC Book I]] BWV 869 playing in the background. The scene shows her wearing the razor-blade glasses and surrounded by people and a harlequin [[Great Dane]]. She has her finger on the mute button of an [[iPod]] speaker, and as she releases it, "Bad Romance" begins to play and a dimly-lit bathhouse is shown. A bright light pans across the walls, activating fluorescent lighting, which shines through a sign reading "Bath Haus of GaGa". As the first hook of the song begins, a group of female dancers wearing white long-sleeved leotards with knee-high boots and matching crowns crawl out of white, [[coffin]]-like pods. The center pod has "Mons†er" written on it, and Gaga emerges wearing an outfit similar to those worn by the others, who begin to dance behind her. A pastiche of ensuing scenes alternates between Gaga singing to herself in front of a mirror and lying in a bathtub.

When the chorus of the song begins, two women pull Gaga out of the bathtub, rip her top clothing off and force her to drink a glass of [[vodka]]. As the second verse begins, Gaga, wearing a diamond-covered outfit topped with a crown, seductively dances for a group of men [[Human trafficking|bidding for her]]. She straddles one of the men, played by Slovenian model [[Yuri Bradac|Jurij Bradač]],<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.si/novice/jurij-bradac-in-lady-gaga|title=Jurij Bradač in Lady Gaga|date=November 11, 2009|language=Slovenian|publisher=MTV|accessdate=February 26, 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100330051448/http://www.mtv.si/novice/jurij-bradac-in-lady-gaga|archivedate=March 30, 2010}}</ref> and performs a [[lap dance]] for him. Afterwards, the man raises his bid and becomes the highest bidder for her. When the chorus is played for the third time, Gaga is shown wearing a faux-[[polar bear]] hide jacket. She walks towards the man, who is sitting on a bed and unbuttoning his shirt, while drinking a glass of vodka. Gaga has a look of indifference on her face and removes her jacket and sunglasses. Suddenly, the bed spontaneously combusts with the man still sitting on it, and Gaga sings in a sinister way in front of the flames. The video ends with her lying beside a smoldering skeleton, on top of the destroyed bed, covered in ashes. With soot smeared across her body, she calmly smokes a cigarette while her [[Pyrotechnics|pyrotechnic]] bra activates.

Jocelyn Vena from MTV believed that the video was symbolic and portrayed how "the old Gaga is over, here's the brand-new Gaga: the one who seems to delight in pushing the boundaries and exploring all manner of sexual proclivities". She further believed that the video was a testament to Gaga's brilliance "as an artist that uses the video art form as the jump-off point for the next leg of their career".<ref name="next">{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1625927/20091110/lady_gaga.jhtml|title=Lady Gaga Launches Her Next Phase With Eye-Grabbing 'Bad Romance Video|last=Vena|first=Jocelyn|date=November 11, 2009|publisher=MTV (MTV Networks)|accessdate=November 11, 2009|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091113084909/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1625927/20091110/lady_gaga.jhtml|archivedate=November 13, 2009}}</ref> In 2011, Claire Suddath of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' said that although later Gaga videos were more elaborate, "Bad Romance" was Gaga at her best.<ref name=clawsout/> In ''Lady Gaga: Behind the Fame'', Emily Herbert drew comparisons between the underlying theme of the video and the theme of ''The Fame Monster''—the relationship with fame.<ref name=behindfame/> She wrote, "Was this the price that Gaga had to pay for the fame she so desired?

The themes were all based around sex, decadence, and corruption; alcohol and even cigarettes, twenty-first century society's biggest no-no, were present, and so by implication ... drugs."<ref name=behindfame/>  ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' noted Gaga as one of the few pop stars of the present time who really understood spectacle, fashion, shock, choreography—all the things that Madonna and [[Michael Jackson]] were masters of in the 1980s.<ref name="wsj"/>

The video and its choreography also drew many comparisons to ''[[Michael Jackson's Thriller (music video)|Michael Jackson's Thriller music video]]'', as both feature robotic, zombie-like arm movements and morbid themes.
