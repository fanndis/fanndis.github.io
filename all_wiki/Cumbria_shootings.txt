}}

The '''Cumbria shootings''' was a [[shooting spree]] which occurred on 2 June 2010 when a lone gunman, taxi driver Derrick Bird, killed twelve people and injured eleven others before committing [[suicide]] in [[Cumbria]], England, United Kingdom. Along with the 1987 [[Hungerford massacre]] and the 1996 [[Dunblane school massacre]], it is one of the worst criminal acts involving firearms in British history. The shootings ended when Bird was found dead in a wooded area after abandoning his car in the village of [[Boot, Cumbria|Boot]].

The shootings began in mid-morning in [[Lamplugh]] and moved to [[Frizington]], [[Whitehaven]], [[Egremont, Cumbria|Egremont]], [[Gosforth, Cumbria|Gosforth]], and [[Seascale]], sparking a major manhunt by the [[Cumbria Constabulary]], with assistance from [[Civil Nuclear Constabulary]] officers. Thirty [[crime scene]]s were investigated.

Queen [[Elizabeth II]] paid tribute to the victims, and the [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince of Wales]] later visited Whitehaven in the wake of the tragedy. [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[David Cameron]] and [[Home Secretary]] [[Theresa May]] also visited West Cumbria. A memorial fund was set up to aid victims and affected communities.

==Timeline==

===Targeted shootings===
In the early hours of 2 June, Derrick Bird left his home in [[Rowrah]], [[Cumbria]], drove his [[Citroën Xsara Picasso]] to his twin brother David's home in [[Lamplugh]],<ref>{{Cite news | title = Cumbria Shootings – Interactive Map | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/10232051.stm | publisher=BBC News | date = 3 June 2010 | accessdate = 4 June 2010}}</ref> and shot him eleven times in the head and body with a [[.22 Long Rifle|.22 calibre]] [[rifle]], killing him.

Bird then drove to [[Frizington]], arriving at the home of the family [[solicitor]], Kevin Commons. Bird prevented Commons from driving away by firing twice with a [[double-barreled shotgun]], hitting him once in the shoulder. Commons staggered out of his car and onto the entrance to his farmyard, where Bird killed him with two rifle shots to the head.<ref name="Operation Bridge: Cumbria Shootings Report"/><ref name="Cumbria shootings: Timeline of Derrick Bird's rampage">{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/10259982|title=Cumbria shootings: Timeline of Derrick Bird's rampage|publisher=BBC News|date=25 March 2011}}</ref><ref name="skynewsvictims">{{Cite news|url=http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/UK-News/Cumbria-Shootings-The-Victims-Are-Named/Article/201006115642616?f=rss |title=Cumbria Shootings: Derrick Bird's Victims |last=Rowley |first=Emma |date=3 June 2010 |publisher=Sky News |accessdate=3 June 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100606115502/http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/UK-News/Cumbria-Shootings-The-Victims-Are-Named/Article/201006115642616?f=rss |archivedate=6 June 2010 }}</ref><ref name=bbc10216179>{{Cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/10216179.stm| title = Gunman kills 12 people in Cumbria rampage| publisher=BBC News| accessdate=2 June 2010|date=2 June 2010}}</ref> At 10:20 [[British Summer Time|BST]], the police were telephoned. Bird then moved on towards [[Whitehaven]].<ref name="BBC10222188">{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/10222188.stm|title=Family dispute theory over Cumbria rampage|publisher=BBC News|date=3 June 2010|accessdate=3 June 2010}}</ref> A witness called the [[Cumbria Constabulary]] to report the Commons shooting, although her call was delayed by several minutes after she asked neighbours what she should do. She also erroneously described Bird as being armed with an [[air rifle]] despite being able to hear the gunshots.<ref name="Operation Bridge: Cumbria Shootings Report"/>

After killing Commons, Bird went to a friend's residence to retrieve a [[shotgun]] he had loaned, although he was answered by the friend's wife, who didn't have access to it.<ref name="Operation Bridge: Cumbria Shootings Report"/> Afterwards, at 10:33, Bird drove to a [[Taxicab stand|taxi rank]] on Duke Street, Whitehaven.<ref name=bbc10214661>{{Cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/10214661.stm| title = Cumbria shooting rampage suspect's 'body found'| accessdate=2 June 2010|date=2 June 2010|publisher=BBC News}}</ref><ref name=telegraph>{{Cite news | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/7797376/Cumbria-shooting-police-hunt-gunman-after-several-shot-dead.html| work=The Daily Telegraph| accessdate=2 June 2010| date=2 June 2010|title = Cumbria shooting: police hunt gunman after 'several shot dead'|first=Murray|last=Wardrup| location=London}}</ref><ref name="Cumbria shootings: Timeline of Derrick Bird's rampage"/> There, he called over Darren Rewcastle, another taxi driver who was previously known to Bird; Bird had conflicts with Rewcastle over his behaviour, his practice of poaching fares, and an incident wherein Rewcastle damaged the tyres on Bird's taxi and openly boasted about it. When Rewcastle approached Bird's taxi, he was shot twice at [[point-blank range]] with the rifle, hitting him in the lower face, chest, and abdomen. Rewcastle died of his injuries, becoming the only person to die in Whitehaven during the attacks.<ref name="Operation Bridge: Cumbria Shootings Report"/><ref name="Cumbria shootings: Timeline of Derrick Bird's rampage"/><ref name="skynewsvictims"/>

Soon after killing Rewcastle, Bird drove alongside another taxi driver, Donald Reid, and shot him in the back, wounding him. Bird then made a loop back to the taxi rank and fired twice at Reid as he waited for emergency personnel, missing him. Next, Bird drove away from the taxi rank and stopped alongside another taxi driver named Paul Wilson as he walked down Scotch Street, and called him over to his vehicle as he did with Rewcastle; when Wilson answered his call, Bird shot him in the right side of his face with the shotgun, severely wounding him. As a result of the shootings, unarmed officers at the local police station were informed and began following Bird's taxi as it drove onto Coach Road. There, Bird fired his shotgun at a passing taxi, injuring the male driver, Terry Kennedy, and the female passenger, Emma Percival. Bird was then able to flee the officers after he aimed his shotgun at two of them, forcing them to take cover. However, he did not fire; he instead took advantage of the officers' distraction to escape.<ref name="Operation Bridge: Cumbria Shootings Report"/>

===Random shootings===
In the wake of the Whitehaven shootings, residents there and in the neighbouring towns of [[Egremont, Cumbria|Egremont]] and [[Seascale]] were urged to stay indoors.<ref>{{Cite news | url = https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/jun/02/gunman-sought-person-shot-dead-whitehaven| work=The Guardian| accessdate=2 June 2010|date=2 June 2010| title = Gunman sought after person shot dead and several injured in Whitehaven| first=James | last=Meikle | location=London}}</ref> A massive [[manhunt (law enforcement)|manhunt]] for Bird was launched by the Cumbria Constabulary, which was assisted by [[Civil Nuclear Constabulary]] officers.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/jun/04/cumbria-shootings-police-response-bird | location=London | work=[[The Guardian]] | title=Cumbria shootings: A frantic pursuit before police found the killer's body | first1=Owen | last1=Bowcott | first2=Rajeev | last2=Syal | first3=Paul | last3=Lewis | first4=Caroline | last4=Davies | date=4 June 2010}}</ref> Bird proceeded to drive through several local towns, firing apparently at random, and calling a majority of the victims over to his taxi before shooting them.

Near Egremont, Bird tried to shoot Jacqueline Williamson as she walked her dog, but she managed to escape without injury. Upon arriving in Egremont, he stopped alongside Susan Hughes as she walked home from shopping, and shot her in the chest and abdomen with the shotgun. He then got out of his taxi and got into a struggle with Hughes before fatally shooting her in the back of the head with his rifle. Then, after driving a short distance onto Bridge End, Bird fired the shotgun at Kenneth Fishburn as he walked in the opposite direction; Fishburn suffered fatal wounds to the head and chest.<ref name="Operation Bridge: Cumbria Shootings Report"/><ref name="Cumbria shootings: Timeline of Derrick Bird's rampage"/><ref name="skynewsvictims" /> This was followed by the shooting of Leslie Hunter, who was called over to Bird's taxi before being shot in the face at close range with the shotgun, then a second time in the back after he turned away to protect himself. Hunter survived his injuries.

Bird then went south towards [[Thornhill, Cumbria|Thornhill]], where he fired his shotgun at Ashley Glaister, a teenage girl; however, he missed her. He then passed [[Drigg and Carleton|Carleton]] and travelled onto the village of [[Wilton, Cumbria|Wilton]], where he tried to visit Jason Carey, a member of a diving club Bird also belonged to, but Bird left when Carey's wife came to the door. Soon afterward, Bird shot Jennifer Jackson once in the chest with his shotgun and twice in the head with his rifle, killing her. Bird then drove past Town Head Farm, but turned back towards it and fired his shotgun, fatally hitting Jackson's husband James in the head and wounding a woman named Christine Hunter-Hall in the back. He then drove back to Carleton and killed Isaac Dixon, a mole-catcher who was talking to a farmer in a field when he was fatally shot twice at close range by Bird's shotgun.<ref name="Operation Bridge: Cumbria Shootings Report"/><ref name="Cumbria shootings: Timeline of Derrick Bird's rampage"/><ref name="skynewsvictims" /> A former semi-professional [[Rugby league|rugby]] player, [[Garry Purdham]], was soon shot and killed while working in a field outside the Red Admiral Hotel at Boonwood, near [[Gosforth, Cumbria|Gosforth]].<ref name="Operation Bridge: Cumbria Shootings Report"/><ref name="Cumbria shootings: Timeline of Derrick Bird's rampage"/><ref name="skynewsvictims" /><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.whitehaven-news.co.uk/cumbria-shootings-the-victims-named-1.715720?referrerPath=cumbrian-gunman-derrick-bird-killed-12-and-injured-25-in-shooting-1.715529|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130505143606/http://www.whitehaven-news.co.uk/cumbria-shootings-the-victims-named-1.715720?referrerPath=cumbrian-gunman-derrick-bird-killed-12-and-injured-25-in-shooting-1.715529|url-status=dead|archive-date=5 May 2013|title=Cumbria shootings: The victims named|work=The Whitehaven News|publisher=CN Group|date=4 June 2010|accessdate=16 January 2011}}</ref>

Bird then drove towards Seascale. Along the way, he began driving slowly and waved other motorists to pass him. He shot a motorist named James "Jamie" Clark, who died of a shotgun wound to the head, although it was not clear at first whether he died from the gunshot wound or the subsequent car crash.<ref name="Operation Bridge: Cumbria Shootings Report"/><ref name="Cumbria shootings: Timeline of Derrick Bird's rampage"/><ref name="skynewsvictims" /> Bird then encountered another motorist named Harry Berger at a narrow, one-way passage underneath a railway bridge. When Berger allowed Bird to enter first, Bird fired at him as he passed by, shooting him twice and causing severe injury to his right arm. Three [[armed response vehicle]]s attempting to pursue Bird were later blocked out of the tunnel by Berger's vehicle; it had to be pushed away to let them pass.

Meanwhile, Bird had driven on to Drigg Road, where he fired twice at Michael Pike, a retired man who was cycling in front of him; the first shot missed, but the second hit Pike in the head and killed him. Seconds later, while on the same street, Bird fatally shot Jane Robinson in the neck and head with his shotgun at point-blank range after apparently calling her over.<ref name="Operation Bridge: Cumbria Shootings Report"/><ref name="Cumbria shootings: Timeline of Derrick Bird's rampage"/>

After the killing of Robinson, who was the last fatality in the shootings, witnesses described Bird as driving increasingly erratically down the street. At 11:33, [[Police constable|Police Constables]] Phillip Lewis and Andrew Laverack spotted Bird as his car passed by their vehicle. They attempted to pursue him, but were delayed in roadworks and lost sight of him a minute later. Soon afterward Bird drove into [[Eskdale, Cumbria|Eskdale valley]], where he wounded Jackie Lewis in the neck with his rifle as she was out walking. At this point, his route had become clearer to police during their search for him. Next, Bird stopped alongside Fiona Moretta, who leaned into his passenger window, believing he was going to ask her for directions. Instead, he injured her in the chest with the rifle, then continued onward towards the village of [[Boot, Cumbria|Boot]].

Arriving in Boot, Bird briefly stopped at a business premises called Sims Travel and fired his rifle at nearby people, but missed. Continuing further into the village, he continued firing at random people and missing. Bird eventually fired his rifle at two men, hitting and severely wounding Nathan Jones in the face. This was shortly followed by a couple who had stopped their car to take a photo; Samantha Chrystie suffered severe wounds to the face from a rifle bullet. Chrystie's partner, Craig Ross, fled upon Bird's instruction and was then fired at, but escaped uninjured.<ref name="Operation Bridge: Cumbria Shootings Report"/>

===Suspect's suicide===
Shortly after firing at two cyclists, Bird crashed his taxi into several vehicles and a stone wall, damaging a tyre.<ref name="Operation Bridge: Cumbria Shootings Report"/> Briefly continuing onward, he abandoned his car at a beauty spot near Boot, called Doctor Bridge, when the damaged tyre deflated. A nearby family of four, who were unaware of the shootings, offered assistance to Bird, but were quickly turned down and advised to leave.<ref name="Cumbria shootings: Timeline of Derrick Bird's rampage"/><ref name=times/> Bird removed the rifle from his taxi and walked over a bridge leading into Oak How Woods.<ref name="Operation Bridge: Cumbria Shootings Report"/> He was last seen alive at 12:30; shortly afterward, police confirmed that there had been fatalities and that they were searching for a suspect. Police later announced they were searching for the driver of a dark-grey Citroën Xsara Picasso<ref name=bbc10214661/> driven by the suspect, who was identified as Bird.<ref name="bbc10216179"/> At around 12:36, armed police officers and dog handlers arrived at the scene of Bird's abandoned taxi and began a search in and around the wooded area.<ref name="Operation Bridge: Cumbria Shootings Report"/>

At 14:00, Deputy Chief Constable Stuart Hyde<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cumbria.police.uk/about-us/who-we-are/deputy-chief-constable--stuart-hyde |title=Biography&nbsp;– Deputy Chief Constable&nbsp;– Stuart Hyde |publisher=Cumbria Constabulary |accessdate=2 June 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100521030823/http://www.cumbria.police.uk/about-us/who-we-are/deputy-chief-constable--stuart-hyde |archivedate=21 May 2010 }}</ref> announced that Bird's body had been found in a wooded area, along with a rifle. Police confirmed shortly afterwards that members of the public who had taken shelter during the incident could now resume their normal activities.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{Cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/10216179.stm| title = Gunman kills several in Cumbria: Timeline| publisher=BBC News| accessdate=2 June 2010|date=2 June 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cumbria.police.uk/news/latest-news/urgent-public-message-shots-fired-in-whitehaven |publisher=Cumbria Constabulary |title=Urgent public message: shots fired in Whitehaven |date=2 June 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5qC03byJm?url=http://www.cumbria.police.uk/news/latest-news/urgent-public-message-shots-fired-in-whitehaven |archivedate=2 June 2010 |url-status=dead |df=dmy }}</ref>

During the manhunt, the gates of the nearby [[Sellafield]] [[nuclear reprocessing]] plant were closed as a precaution, and the afternoon shift was told not to come to work. This was the first lock-down in the history of the plant.<ref name=bbc10214661/>

===Aftermath===
At 15:00, during his first session of [[Prime Minister's Questions]], [[David Cameron]] confirmed that "at least five" people had died, including the gunman.<ref name=guardian-updates>{{Cite news | url = https://www.theguardian.com/uk/blog/2010/jun/02/whitehaven-shooting-live-updates| work=The Guardian| accessdate=2 June 2010|date=2 June 2010| title = Whitehaven shooting&nbsp;– live updates | location=London | first=Matthew | last=Weaver}}</ref> Over the next few hours, Bird's shooting of his brother and solicitor was announced. Later that evening, a police press conference in Whitehaven announced that twelve people had been killed, that a further eleven people were injured, three of them critically,<ref name=guardian-updates /> and that the suspect had [[suicide|killed himself]]. They also confirmed that two weapons (a double-barrelled shotgun and a .22-calibre rifle with a [[Telescopic sight|scope]] and [[Silencer (firearms)|silencer]]) had been used by the suspect in the attacks and that thirty crime scenes were being investigated.<ref name=bbc10214661/> The shootings were considered the worst mass-casualty shooting incident in the UK since the 1996 [[Dunblane school massacre]], which left eighteen people dead.<ref>BBC News Special, [[BBC One]], 2 April 2010</ref> A report later determined that Bird fired at least forty-seven rounds during the shootings (twenty-nine from his shotgun, eighteen from his .22 rifle). Six live .22 rounds were also found on Bird's body, while an additional eight were found held inside the rifle. A search in Bird's home later recovered over 750 rounds of live .22 ammunition, 240 live shotgun shells, and a large amount of financial paperwork.<ref name="Operation Bridge: Cumbria Shootings Report"/>

The police stated that the shootings took place along a {{convert|24|km|mi}} stretch of the Cumbrian coastline.<ref name=times>{{Cite news | url = http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article7142413.ece| title = Police identify man wanted over drive-by shootings in Cumbria|work=The Times | accessdate=2 June 2010|date=2 June 2010|first= Adam|last=Fresco | location=London}}</ref> Helicopters from neighbouring [[Police forces of the United Kingdom|police forces]] were used in the manhunt,<ref name=bbc10214661/> while those from the [[RAF Search and Rescue Force]] and the [[Yorkshire Air Ambulance]] responded to casualties.

Bird had been a licensed firearms holder, and the incident sparked debate about further [[gun control in the United Kingdom]]; the previous Dunblane and [[Hungerford massacre|Hungerford shootings]] had led to increased firearms controls.<ref name=BBC10220974>{{Cite news|last=Casciani|first=Dominic|title=Gun control and ownership laws in the UK|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/10220974.stm|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=3 June 2010 | date=3 June 2010}}</ref>

===Possible motives===
There has been speculation that Bird may have had a grudge against people associated with the Sellafield nuclear power plant that he worked for as a [[joiner]], resigning in 1990 due to an allegation of theft of wood from the plant. Bird was subsequently convicted and given a twelve-month [[suspended sentence]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/10216923.stm |title=BBC profile |publisher=BBC News |date=3 June 2010 |accessdate=26 June 2010}}</ref> Three of the dead were former employees, although there is no evidence that any were involved with his resignation.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Cumbria shootings: Derrick Bird left Sellafield after theft claims |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/7804857/Cumbria-shootings-Derrick-Bird-left-Sellafield-after-theft-claims.html |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date=5 June 2010}}</ref>

Terry Kennedy, a fellow taxi driver who described himself as one of Bird's best friends, and was wounded by Bird, has claimed that he had a relationship with a Thai girl he met on holiday in [[Pattaya]], Thailand. It has been further claimed by another friend of Bird that he had sent [[Pound sterling|£]]1,000 to the girl, who subsequently ended their relationship via a text message; he added that Bird had been "made a fool out of".<ref>{{Cite news |title=Cumbria gunman Derrick Bird 'dumped by Thai lover after sending £1,000' |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/7806587/Cumbria-gunman-Derrick-Bird-dumped-by-Thai-lover-after-sending-1000.html |author=Rebecca Lefort |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date=6 June 2010}}</ref>

It has also been speculated that Bird had been involved with a family dispute over his father's [[will (law)|will]]. The speculation was heightened when it was revealed that he had targeted and killed both his twin, David, and the family's solicitor, Kevin Commons, in his attacks.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/10222188.stm "Family dispute theory over Cumbria rampage"] BBC News.

Police investigating the killings have also found that Bird was the subject of an ongoing tax investigation by HM Revenue and Customs for [[tax evasion]] and the threat of possible future prosecution and punishment might have contributed to his action.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/10244223.stm "Cumbria killer Derrick Bird 'probed over tax"] BBC News.
