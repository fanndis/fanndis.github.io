'''Hurricane Katrina''' was a large [[List of Category 5 Atlantic hurricanes|Category 5 Atlantic hurricane]] which caused over 1,800 deaths and $125 billion in damage in August 2005, particularly in the city of [[New Orleans]] and the surrounding areas. It was at the time the costliest tropical cyclone on record, and is now tied with 2017's [[Hurricane Harvey]]. The storm was the twelfth [[tropical cyclone]], the fifth hurricane, and the third [[major hurricane]] of the [[2005 Atlantic hurricane season]], as well as the fourth-most intense [[Atlantic hurricane]] on record to make landfall in the [[contiguous United States]].

Katrina originated on August 23, 2005 as a tropical depression from the merger of a [[tropical wave]] and the remnants of [[Tropical Depression Ten (2005)|Tropical Depression Ten]]. Early the following day, the depression intensified into a [[tropical storm]] as it headed generally westward toward [[Florida]], strengthening into a hurricane two hours before making landfall at [[Hallandale Beach, Florida|Hallandale Beach]] on August 25. After briefly weakening to tropical storm strength over southern Florida, Katrina emerged into the [[Gulf of Mexico]] on August 26 and began to [[Rapid intensification|rapidly intensify]]. The storm strengthened into a [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale#Category 5|Category 5]] hurricane over the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico<ref>{{cite news|title=NASA – Heat in the Gulf|url=https://www.nasa.gov/vision/earth/lookingatearth/katrina_seaheight.html|work=www.nasa.gov|date=September 16, 2005|language=en|access-date=April 27, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170614144513/https://www.nasa.gov/vision/earth/lookingatearth/katrina_seaheight.html|archive-date=June 14, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> before weakening to Category 3 strength at its second landfall on August 29 over southeast [[Louisiana]] and [[Mississippi]].

The emergency response from federal, state and local governments was widely criticized, resulting in the resignations of [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] (FEMA) director [[Michael D. Brown]] and [[New Orleans Police Department]] (NOPD) Superintendent [[Eddie Compass]]. Many other government officials were criticized for their responses, especially New Orleans Mayor [[Ray Nagin]], Louisiana Governor [[Kathleen Blanco]], and President [[George W. Bush]], while several agencies, including the [[United States Coast Guard]] (USCG), [[National Hurricane Center]] (NHC), and [[National Weather Service]] (NWS), were commended for their actions. The NHC was especially applauded for providing accurate forecasts well in advance.<ref name="CongressInvestigation" /> Katrina was the earliest 11th named storm on record before being surpassed by [[Tropical Storm Kyle (2020)|Tropical Storm Kyle]] on August 14, 2020.{{Citation needed|date=December 2020}}

==Meteorological history==
{{Main|Meteorological history of Hurricane Katrina}}
{{storm path|Katrina 2005 track.png}}
Hurricane Katrina formed as Tropical Depression Twelve over the southeastern Bahamas on August 23, 2005, as the result of the merger of a [[tropical wave]] and the remnants of [[Tropical Depression Ten (2005)|Tropical Depression Ten]] four days earlier. The storm strengthened into [[Tropical cyclone#Tropical storm|Tropical Storm]] Katrina on the morning of August 24. The tropical storm moved towards Florida and became a hurricane only two hours before making [[landfall (meteorology)|landfall]] between [[Hallandale Beach, Florida|Hallandale Beach]] and [[Aventura, Florida|Aventura]] on the morning of August 25. The storm weakened over land, but it regained hurricane status about one hour after entering the Gulf of Mexico, and it continued strengthening over open waters. On August 27, the storm reached Category 3 intensity on the [[Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale]], becoming the third [[Tropical cyclone scales#Atlantic and East Pacific|major hurricane]] of the season. An [[eyewall replacement cycle]] disrupted the intensification but caused the storm to nearly double in size.<ref name="KatrinaTCR">{{cite report|url={{NHC TCR url|id=AL122005_Katrina}}|title=Hurricane Katrina: August 23–30, 2005|author=Knabb, Richard D|author2=Rhome, Jamie R|date=December 20, 2005|publisher=United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Weather Service|author3=Brown, Daniel P|author4=National Hurricane Center|access-date=January 8, 2016|format=PDF|type=Tropical Cyclone Report}}</ref> Thereafter, Katrina [[rapid deepening|rapidly intensified]] over the "unusually warm" waters of the [[Loop Current]] from a Category 3 hurricane to a Category 5 hurricane in just nine hours.<ref>{{cite web|author1=Leben, Robert |author2=Born, George |author3=Scott, Jim |url=http://www.colorado.edu/news/releases/2005/358.html|title=CU-Boulder Researchers Chart Katrina's Growth In Gulf Of Mexico|publisher=[[University of Colorado at Boulder]]|date=September 15, 2005|access-date=May 20, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090301014255/http://www.colorado.edu/news/releases/2005/358.html|archive-date=March 1, 2009}}</ref>

[[File:NOAA-Hurricane-Katrina-Aug28-05-2145UTC.jpg|thumb|right|Katrina on August 28, nearing the [[Gulf Coast]].]]
After attaining Category 5 status on the morning of August 28, Katrina reached its peak strength at 1800 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]], with maximum sustained winds of {{convert|175|mph|km/h|-1|abbr=on}} and a minimum central [[atmospheric pressure|pressure]] of {{convert|902|mbar|inHg|abbr=on|lk=on}}. The pressure measurement made Katrina the fifth most intense Atlantic hurricane on record at the time, only to be surpassed by Hurricanes [[Hurricane Rita|Rita]] and [[Hurricane Wilma|Wilma]] later in the season; it was also the strongest hurricane ever recorded in the [[Gulf of Mexico]] at the time, before Rita broke the record.<ref name="KatrinaTCR"/> The hurricane subsequently weakened due to another eyewall replacement cycle, and Katrina made its second landfall at 1110 UTC on August 29, as a Category 3 hurricane with sustained winds of 125&nbsp;mph (205&nbsp;km/h), near [[Buras-Triumph, Louisiana]]. At landfall, hurricane-force winds extended outward {{convert|120|mi|km}} from the center and the storm's central pressure was {{convert|920|mbar|inHg|abbr=on}}. After moving over southeastern Louisiana and [[Breton Sound]], it made its third and final landfall near the Louisiana–Mississippi border with {{convert|120|mph|km/h|-1|abbr=on}} sustained winds, still at Category 3 intensity.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://weather.com/storms/hurricane/news/atlantic-hurricane-category-five-history-0|title=Monsters of the Atlantic: The Basin's Category 5 Hurricanes|work=The Weather Channel|access-date=September 11, 2017|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170906093016/https://weather.com/storms/hurricane/news/atlantic-hurricane-category-five-history-0|archive-date=September 6, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> Katrina maintained strength well into Mississippi, finally losing hurricane strength more than {{convert|150|mi|km}} inland near [[Meridian, Mississippi]]. It was downgraded to a tropical depression near [[Clarksville, Tennessee]]; its remnants were absorbed by a [[cold front]] in the eastern [[Great Lakes]] region on August 31. The resulting [[extratropical]] storm moved rapidly to the northeast and affected eastern Canada.<ref name="KatrinaTCR"/>

Hurricane Katrina first made landfall between [[Hallandale Beach, Florida|Hallandale Beach]] and [[Aventura, Florida]] on August 25. The storm dropped heavy rainfall in portions of the [[Miami metropolitan area]], with a peak total of {{convert|16.43|in|mm|abbr=on}} in [[Perrine, Florida|Perrine]]. As a result, local flooding occurred in [[Miami-Dade County, Florida|Miami-Dade County]], damaging approximately 100&nbsp;homes. Farther south in the Florida Keys, a [[tornado]] was spawned in [[Marathon, Florida|Marathon]] on August 26. The tornado damaged a hangar at the airport there and caused an estimated $5 million in damage.<ref name="Marathon Tornado">Devenas, Andy "[https://web.archive.org/web/20060624012057/http://www.srh.noaa.gov/key/HTML/Marathon_Report.pdf Marathon Tornado Survey Report]." ''[[National Weather Service]] Forecast Office [[Key West, Florida]]'' Retrieved on June 5, 2006.</ref> The rains caused flooding, and the combination of rains and winds downed trees and power lines, leaving 1.45&nbsp;million people without power. Damage in South Florida was estimated at $523 million, mostly as a result of crop damage. Twelve deaths occurred in South Florida, of which three were caused by downed trees in Broward County, three from drowning in Miami-Dade County, three were from carbon monoxide poisoning caused by generators, one was due to a vehicle accident, one occurred during debris cleanup, and one was associated with a lack of electricity.

Significant impacts were also reported in the [[Florida Panhandle]]. Although Katrina moved ashore in Louisiana and Mississippi, its outer periphery produced a 5.37&nbsp;ft (1.64&nbsp;m) storm surge in [[Pensacola, Florida|Pensacola]].

On August 29, 2005, Hurricane Katrina made landfall near [[Buras-Triumph, Louisiana]], with {{convert|125|mph|km/h|-1|abbr=on}} winds, a strong Category 3 storm. Although the storm surge to the east of the path of the eye in Mississippi was higher, a significant surge affected the Louisiana coast. The height of the surge is uncertain because of a lack of data, although a tide gauge in [[Plaquemines Parish]] indicated a storm tide in excess of {{convert|14|ft|m|1}}, and a {{convert|12|ft|m|1|adj=on}} storm surge was recorded in [[Grand Isle, Louisiana|Grand Isle]].

Hurricane Katrina also brought heavy rain to Louisiana, with {{convert|8|-|10|in|mm}} falling on a wide swath of the eastern part of the state. In the area around [[Slidell, Louisiana|Slidell]], the rainfall was even higher, and the highest rainfall recorded in the state was approximately 15 inches (380&nbsp;mm). As a result of the rainfall and storm surge the level of [[Lake Pontchartrain]] rose and caused significant flooding along its northeastern shore, affecting communities from Slidell to [[Mandeville, Louisiana|Mandeville]].

As the eye of Hurricane Katrina swept to the northeast, it subjected the city to hurricane conditions for hours. Although power failures prevented accurate measurement of wind speeds in New Orleans, there were a few measurements of hurricane-force winds; based on this information, the NHC concluded that much of the city likely experienced sustained winds of Category 1 or 2 strength.

Katrina's storm surge caused 53 levee breaches in the [[Flood Control Act of 1965|federally built levee system]] protecting metro New Orleans and the failure of the 40 Arpent Canal levee. Failures occurred in New Orleans and surrounding communities, especially St. Bernard Parish. The [[Mississippi River Gulf Outlet]] (MR-GO) breached its levees in approximately 20 places, flooding much of eastern New Orleans, most of [[Saint Bernard Parish, Louisiana|St. Bernard Parish]] and the East Bank of [[Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana|Plaquemines Parish]]. The major levee breaches in the city included breaches at the [[17th Street Canal]] levee, the [[London Avenue Canal]], and the wide, navigable [[Industrial Canal]], which left approximately 80% of the city flooded.<ref>Murphy, Verity.

An [[Oil platform|oil rig]] under construction along the [[Mobile River]] broke its moorings and floated {{convert|1.5|mi|km}} northwards before striking the Cochrane Bridge just outside Mobile. No significant damage resulted to the bridge and it was soon reopened. The damage on [[Dauphin Island]] was severe, with the surge destroying many houses and cutting a new canal through the western portion of the island. An offshore oil rig also became grounded on the island. As in Mississippi, the storm surge caused significant beach erosion along the Alabama coastline.<ref name="KatrinaTCR"/> More than 600,000 people lost power in Alabama as a result of Hurricane Katrina and two people died in a traffic accident in the state.

Within the United States and as delineated in the [[National Response Plan]], disaster response and planning is first and foremost a local government responsibility. When local government exhausts its resources, it then requests specific additional resources from the county level. The request process proceeds similarly from the county to the state to the federal government as additional resource needs are identified. Many of the problems that arose developed from inadequate planning and back-up communication systems at various levels.<ref name="usgovwh"/>

Some [[disaster recovery]] response to Katrina began before the storm, with the [[Federal Emergency Management Agency of the United States|Federal Emergency Management Agency]] (FEMA) preparations that ranged from logistical supply deployments to a [[mortuary]] team with refrigerated trucks.

===Criticism of government response===
{{Main|Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina}}
[[File:USNS Comfort.jpg|thumb|upright|[[USNS Comfort|USNS ''Comfort'']] takes on supplies at [[Mayport, Florida]], en route to the Gulf Coast.]]
The criticisms of the government's response to Hurricane Katrina primarily consisted of criticism of [[Administrative incompetence|mismanagement]] and lack of [[leadership]] in the relief efforts in response to the storm and its aftermath. More specifically, the criticism focused on the delayed response to the flooding of New Orleans, and the subsequent state of chaos in the city.<ref name="thevenot" /> The [[neologism]] ''Katrina[[-gate|gate]]'' was coined to refer to this controversy, and was a runner-up for "2005 word of the year."<ref>Clark, Heather. "[https://web.archive.org/web/20060325135124/http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory?id=1480616 Linguists Vote 'Truthiness' Word of 2005]." ''ABC News.'' January 6, 2006. Retrieved on April 14, 2010.</ref>

Within days of Katrina's August 29 landfall, public debate arose about the local, state and federal governments' role in the [[Preparations for Hurricane Katrina|preparations]] for and response to the hurricane. Criticism was initially prompted by televised images of visibly shaken and frustrated political leaders, and of residents who remained stranded by flood waters without [[drinking water|water]], [[food]], or shelter. Deaths from [[thirst]], [[Fatigue (medical)|exhaustion]] and [[violence]] days after the storm had passed fueled the criticism, as did the dilemma of the evacuees at facilities such as the Louisiana Superdome and the New Orleans Civic Center. Some alleged that [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[social class|class]], and other factors could have contributed to delays in government response. For example, during ''[[A Concert for Hurricane Relief]]'', a benefit concert for victims of the hurricane, rapper [[Kanye West]] veered off script and harshly criticized the government's response to the crisis, stating that "George Bush doesn't care about [[black people]]."<ref>{{cite news|last=de Moraes|first=Lisa|title=Kanye West's Torrent of Criticism, Live on NBC|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/09/03/AR2005090300165.html|work=The Washington Post|date=September 3, 2005|access-date=September 1, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080806153052/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/09/03/AR2005090300165.html|archive-date=August 6, 2008|url-status=live}}</ref>

In accordance with federal law, President George W.

However, the President and Secretary Chertoff initially came under harsh criticism for what some perceived as a lack of planning and coordination.

Politicians, activists, pundits, and journalists also directed criticism at the local and state governments headed by Mayor Nagin of New Orleans and Louisiana Governor Blanco. Nagin and Blanco were criticized for failing to implement New Orleans' evacuation plan and for ordering residents to a shelter of last resort without any provisions for food, water, security, or sanitary conditions. Perhaps the most important criticism of Nagin was that he delayed his emergency evacuation order until 19 hours before landfall, which led to hundreds of deaths of people who could not find any way out of the city.<ref name="CongressInvestigation"/>

The destruction wrought by Hurricane Katrina raised other, more general public policy issues about [[emergency management]], [[environmental policy]], [[poverty]], and [[unemployment]]. The discussion of both the immediate response and of the broader public policy issues may have affected [[elections]] and [[legislation]] enacted at various [[Executive (government)|levels of government]]. The storm's devastation also prompted a Congressional investigation, which found that FEMA and the Red Cross "did not have a logistics capacity sophisticated enough to fully support the massive number of Gulf coast victims." Additionally, it placed responsibility for the disaster on all three levels of government.<ref name="CongressInvestigation"/> An ABC News [[Opinion poll|poll]] conducted on September 2, 2005, showed more blame was being directed at state and local governments (75%) than at the Federal government (67%), with 44% blaming Bush's leadership directly.<ref name="abcnewspoll">Langer, Gary.

According to a modeling exercise conducted by the [[U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]] (USACE), two-thirds of the deaths in [[Greater New Orleans]] were due to levee and [[flood wall]] failure.<ref>Charles F.

American Society of Civil Engineers. Retrieved July 25, 2016.</ref> On April 5, 2006, months after independent investigators had demonstrated that levee failures were not caused by natural forces beyond intended design strength, Lieutenant General [[Carl Strock]], [[Chief of Engineers]] and Commander of the Corps of Engineers, testified before the United States Senate Subcommittee on Energy and Water that "We have now concluded we had problems with the design of the structure."<ref>Staff Writers "[https://web.archive.org/web/20080527010320/http://www.unregisterednews.com/content/view/184/53/ Problems with the design of levees]."

A June 2007 report released by the [[American Society of Civil Engineers]] determined that the failures of the levees and flood walls in New Orleans were found to be primarily the result of system design and construction flaws.<ref name="ASCE HKERP report"/> The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers had been federally mandated in the [[Flood Control Act of 1965]] with responsibility for the conception, design, and construction of the region's flood-control system. All of the major studies in the aftermath of Katrina concluded that the USACE was responsible for the failure of the levees. This was primarily attributed to a decision to use shorter steel sheet pilings during construction in an effort to save money.<ref name="Robertson"/> According to a report published in August 2015 in the official journal of the [[World Water Council]], the Corps misinterpreted the results of a 1985 study and wrongly concluded that sheet piles in the flood walls needed to be driven to depths of only {{convert|17|ft|0}} instead of between {{convert|31|and|46|ft|0}}. That decision saved approximately US$100 million, but significantly reduced overall engineering reliability.<ref>{{cite news |page=707 |author1=J. David Rogers |author2=G.

In January 2008, Judge [[Stanwood Duval]] of the U.S. District Court ruled that despite the Corps' role in the flooding, the agency<ref name="Nossiter"/> could not be held financially liable because of [[sovereign immunity]] in the [[Flood Control Act of 1928]]. Exactly ten years after Katrina, J. David Rogers, lead author of a new report in the official journal of the World Water Council, concluded that the flooding during Katrina "could have been prevented had the corps retained an external review board to double-check its flood-wall designs."<ref>{{cite news|last=Stoltz|first=Mary Helen|title=Flood damage after Katrina could have been prevented, S&T expert says|publisher=Missouri S&T|date=August 24, 2015|access-date=February 22, 2016|url=http://news.mst.edu/2015/08/flood-damage-after-katrina-could-have-been-prevented-st-expert-says/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160220034916/http://news.mst.edu/2015/08/flood-damage-after-katrina-could-have-been-prevented-st-expert-says/|archive-date=February 20, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>

Other factors may have contributed to the flooding. According to the authors of ''Catastrophe in the Making'' (Island Press, 2009), the straight design and lack of outward flow into the Gulf allowed the [[Mississippi River-Gulf Outlet Canal]] to become "the perfect shortcut for salt-water intrusion" which damaged buffering cypress forests and wetlands which historically had protected New Orleans from storm surge.<ref>{{cite book|page=120|author1=Freudenburg, William R.|first2=Robert|last2=Gramling|title=Catastrophe in the Making|publisher=Island Press|year=2009|access-date=October 15, 2015|url=https://www.islandpress.org/book/catastrophe-in-the-making|display-authors=etal|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160105121505/https://www.islandpress.org/book/catastrophe-in-the-making|archive-date=January 5, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> The Army Corps of Engineers built and maintained the canal. Furthermore, according to storm surge researcher Hassan Mashriqui:

Initially ten or more miles apart, these two channels meet, and when they do, the water building between their levees is squeezed into a single channel – the Funnel – only 260 yards wide, constrained by levees 14 feet to 16 feet high….In concert with the denuded marshes, it could increase the local storm surge hitting the Intracoastal Waterway by 20 percent to 40 percent – a critical and fundamental flaw.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZNroiySUreQC|title=The Storm: What Went Wrong and Why During Hurricane Katrina&nbsp;– the Inside Story from One Louisiana Scientist|first1=Ivor van|last1=Heerden|first2=Mike|last2=Bryan|date=May 18, 2006|publisher=Penguin|via=Google Books|isbn=9781101201701|access-date=October 30, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160428000452/https://books.google.com/books?id=ZNroiySUreQC|archive-date=April 28, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>}}

Congress ordered the MRGO closed as a direct result.

Many of the levees have been reconstructed since Katrina. In reconstructing them, precautions were taken to bring the levees up to modern building code standards and to ensure their safety. For example, in every situation possible, the Corps of Engineers replaced I-walls with T-walls, which have a horizontal concrete base that protects against soil erosion underneath the flood walls.<ref name=Walls>{{cite news | first=Matt | last=Crenson | agency=Associated Press | url=http://www.constructionequipmentguide.com/story.asp?story=6589 | title=Levee Repairs to Be Finished By First Day of Hurricane Season | date=February 2, 2006 | access-date=May 12, 2008 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060207184213/http://www.constructionequipmentguide.com/story.asp?story=6589 | archive-date=February 7, 2006 | url-status=live }}</ref>

Funding battles continue over the remaining levee improvements. In February 2008, the Bush administration requested that the state of Louisiana pay about $1.5 billion of an estimated $7.2 billion for Corps of Engineers levee work (in accordance with the principles of local cost sharing required by Congress as early as the [[Flood Control Act of 1928]]), a proposal which angered many Louisiana leaders.<ref name=funding>{{cite news | title=White House Budget for Levee Work Riles Many Louisiana Elected Officials | agency=Associated Press | first=Cain | last=Burdeau | url=http://www.cegltd.com/story.asp?story=10045 | date=February 12, 2008 | access-date=May 12, 2008}}</ref> On May 2, 2008, Louisiana Governor [[Bobby Jindal]] used a speech to The National Press Club to request that President Bush free up money to complete work on Louisiana's levees.

===Media involvement===
{{Main|Media coverage of Hurricane Katrina}}
Many representatives of the [[news media]] reporting on the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina became directly involved in the unfolding events, instead of simply reporting. Because of the loss of most means of communication, such as land-based and cellular telephone systems, field reporters in many cases became conduits for information between victims and authorities. The authorities, who monitored local and network news broadcasts, as well as internet sites, would then attempt to coordinate rescue efforts based on the reports. One illustration was when [[Geraldo Rivera]] of [[Fox News]] tearfully pleaded for authorities to either send help or evacuate the thousands of evacuees stranded at the [[Ernest N. Morial Convention Center]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Geraldo Rivera & Shepard Smith Unleashed |url=http://www.spike.com/video-clips/gmidjv/geraldo-rivera-shepard-smith-unleashed |website=Spike.com |access-date=January 4, 2016 |date=September 5, 2005 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160314143006/http://www.spike.com/video-clips/gmidjv/geraldo-rivera-shepard-smith-unleashed |archive-date=March 14, 2016 }}</ref> The role of AM radio was also of importance to the hundreds of thousands of persons with no other ties to news, providing emergency information regarding access to assistance for hurricane victims. Immediately after Katrina, [[WWL-AM]] was one of the few area radio stations in the area remaining on the air. This emergency service, simulcasted on shortwave outlet [[WHRI]], was named "[[United Radio Broadcasters of New Orleans|The United Radio Broadcasters of New Orleans]]." Their ongoing nighttime broadcasts continued to be available up to {{convert|500|mi|km|abbr=on}} away. Announcers continued to broadcast from improvised studio facilities after the storm damaged their main studios.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://radio.about.com/gi/o.htm?zi=1/XJ&zTi=1&sdn=radio&cdn=gadgets&tm=58&f=00&su=p504.1.336.ip_&tt=2&bt=0&bts=0&st=23&zu=http://www.mediaweek.com/mw/news/recent_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1001052023|title=Local Media Outlets Struggle to Carry On Post Katrina|date=August 31, 2005|access-date=April 14, 2010|first1=Katy|last1=Bachman|first2=Tony|last2=Sanders|magazine=Billboard Radio Monitor}}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> The [[cellular phone]] antenna network was severely damaged and completely inoperable for several months.

The storm also brought a dramatic rise in the role of [[Website|Internet sites]]—especially [[blogging]] and [[community journalism]]. One example was the effort of ''NOLA.com'', the web affiliate of New Orleans' ''[[The Times-Picayune|Times-Picayune]]''. A group of reporters were awarded the Breaking News [[Pulitzer Prize]]<ref name="Pulitzer BN">{{cite web | author = The Pulitzer Board | title = 2006 Pulitzer Prize Winners – Breaking News Reporting | year = 2006 | access-date = November 15, 2008 | url = http://www.pulitzer.org/citation/2006,Breaking+News+Reporting | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090110190152/http://www.pulitzer.org/citation/2006,Breaking+News+Reporting | archive-date = January 10, 2009 | url-status = live }}</ref> and shared the Public Service Pulitzer with the Biloxi-based ''[[The Sun Herald|Sun Herald]]''.<ref name="Pulitzer PS">{{cite web | author = The Pulitzer Board | title = 2006 Pulitzer Prize Winners – Public Service | year = 2006 | access-date = November 15, 2008 | url = http://www.pulitzer.org/citation/2006,Public+Service | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20081219132758/http://www.pulitzer.org/citation/2006,Public+Service | archive-date = December 19, 2008 | url-status = live }}</ref> The newspaper's coverage was carried for days only on NOLA's blogs, as the newspaper lost its presses and evacuated its building as water rose around it on August 30. The site became an international focal point for news by local media, and also became a vital link for rescue operations and later for reuniting scattered residents, as it accepted and posted thousands of individual pleas for rescue on its blogs and forums. NOLA was monitored constantly by an array of rescue teams—from individuals to the Coast Guard—which used information in rescue efforts. Much of this information was relayed from trapped victims via the SMS functions of their cell phones, to friends and relatives outside the area, who then relayed the information back to NOLA.com. The aggregation of community journalism, user photos, and the use of the internet site as a collaborative response to the storm attracted international attention and was called a watershed moment in journalism.<ref name="OJR NOLA">{{cite web|first=Mark |last=Glaser |title=NOLA.com blogs and forums help save lives after Katrina |date=September 13, 2005 |publisher=Online Journalism Review |access-date=August 2, 2006 |url=http://www.ojr.org/ojr/stories/050913glaser/ |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060720085133/http://www.ojr.org/ojr/stories/050913glaser/ |archive-date=July 20, 2006 }}</ref> In the wake of these online-only efforts, the Pulitzer Committee for the first time opened all its categories to online entries.<ref name="Pulitzer speech">{{cite web | first = Paul | last = Steiger | title = Remarks at Pulitzer Prize luncheon | date = May 22, 2006 | access-date = November 15, 2008 | publisher = The Pulitzer Board | url = http://www.pulitzer.org/2006_luncheon_steiger | author-link = Paul Steiger | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090110190421/http://www.pulitzer.org/2006_luncheon_steiger | archive-date = January 10, 2009 | url-status = live }}</ref>

As the U.S. military and rescue services regained control over the city, there were restrictions on the activity of the media. On September 9, the military leader of the relief effort announced that reporters would have "zero access" to efforts to recover bodies in New Orleans. Immediately following this announcement, CNN filed a [[lawsuit]] and obtained a temporary [[restraining order]] against the ban. The next day the government backed down and reversed the ban.<ref name="Media Ban">Staff Writer.

===Retirement===
{{See also|List of retired Atlantic hurricane names}}
Because of the large death toll and destruction of property along the [[Gulf Coast]], the name Katrina was officially retired on April 6, 2006, by the [[World Meteorological Organization]] at the request of the U.S. government. The name will never again be used for another [[North Atlantic hurricane]]. It was replaced by [[Hurricane Katia|Katia]] on List III of the [[Atlantic hurricane naming lists]], which was used in the [[2011 Atlantic hurricane season]].<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.noaanews.noaa.gov/stories2006/s2607.htm|title = Dennis, Katrina, Rita, Stan, and Wilma "Retired" from List of Storm Names|access-date = August 28, 2006|date = April 6, 2006|publisher = NOAA|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20171224105328/http://www.noaanews.noaa.gov/stories2006/s2607.htm|archive-date = December 24, 2017|url-status = live}}</ref>

=== Studies concerning post-Katrina victims ===
An article published in the ''Community Mental Health Journal'' from January 2016 revealed information about a recent study on the psychosocial needs of Hurricane Katrina evacuees that temporarily resided in Dallas, Texas. More than one-fourth of the sample met the criteria for major depressive disorder (MDD). About one-third of the individuals received a referral to mental health services for meeting symptom criteria for incident MDD and PTSD.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=King|first1=Richard V.|last2=Polatin|first2=Peter B.|last3=Hogan|first3=David|last4=Downs|first4=Dana L.|last5=North|first5=Carol S.|date=January 1, 2016|title=Needs Assessment of Hurricane Katrina Evacuees Residing Temporarily in Dallas|journal=Community Mental Health Journal|volume=52|issue=1|pages=18–24|doi=10.1007/s10597-015-9938-5|issn=1573-2789|pmid=26507550|s2cid=9817578}}</ref>

In a study published in ''[[Maternal and Child Health Journal]]'', five-to seven years after the disaster, 308 New Orleans pregnant women were interviewed about their exposure to Katrina. Researchers found that there were associations between experiencing damage during Katrina and birthweight, thus researchers concluded that natural disasters may have long-term effects on pregnancy outcomes. Furthermore, it was concluded that women who are most vulnerable to disaster may be more vulnerable to poor pregnancy outcome.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Harville|first1=Emily W.|last2=Giarratano|first2=Gloria|last3=Savage|first3=Jane|last4=Barcelona de Mendoza|first4=Veronica|last5=Zotkiewicz|first5=TrezMarie|date=November 1, 2015|title=Birth Outcomes in a Disaster Recovery Environment: New Orleans Women After Katrina|journal=Maternal and Child Health Journal|volume=19|issue=11|pages=2512–2522|doi=10.1007/s10995-015-1772-4|issn=1573-6628|pmc=4596760|pmid=26122255}}</ref>

From a September 2015 journal of ''Current Psychology'', a study examined the attitudes of older, long-term residents of Baton Rouge, Louisiana toward displaced newcomers to their community. After using multiple tests, analyses, and descriptive statistics, the study suggested residents grew to become more patient, tolerant, and friendly towards newcomers.  The study also suggests, however, that residents felt more fearful and suspicious of the evacuees, as well as the fact that they were being taken advantage of more.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Kamo|first1=Yoshinori|last2=Henderson|first2=Tammy L.|last3=Roberto|first3=Karen A.|last4=Peabody|first4=Kimberly L.|last5=White|first5=Jamikka K.|date=August 2, 2015|title=Perceptions of Older Adults in a Community Accepting Displaced Survivors of Hurricane Katrina|journal=Current Psychology|language=en|volume=34|issue=3|pages=551–563|doi=10.1007/s12144-015-9356-4|s2cid=146488181|issn=1046-1310}}</ref>

==Reconstruction==

[[File:FEMA - 21590 - Photograph by Marvin Nauman taken on 01-21-2006 in Louisiana.jpg|thumb|Volunteers from [[AmeriCorps]] in New Orleans, January 2006]]
Reconstruction of each section of the southern portion of Louisiana has been addressed in the Army Corps LACPR (Louisiana Coastal Protection and Restoration) Final Technical Report, which identifies areas to not be rebuilt and areas where buildings need to be elevated.<ref name="The LACPR Home Page">{{cite web|url=http://www.lacpr.usace.army.mil/ |title=The LACPR Home Page |author=United States Army Corps of Engineers |publisher=[[United States Army]] |year=2009 |access-date=August 9, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090825084458/http://www.lacpr.usace.army.mil/ |archive-date=August 25, 2009  |author-link=United States Army Corps of Engineers }}</ref>

The Technical Report includes:
* locations of possible new levees to be built
* suggested existing levee modifications
* "Inundation Zones", "Water depths less than 14 feet, Raise-In-Place of Structures", "Water depths greater than 14 feet, Buyout of Structures", "Velocity Zones" and "Buyout of Structures" areas for five different scenarios.

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers submitted the report to the U.S. Congress for consideration, planning, and response in mid-2009.

==Records==
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2020}}
Katrina is the costliest tropical cyclone on record, tying with [[Hurricane Harvey]] in [[2017 Atlantic hurricane season|2017]]. The storm was the fourth-most intense [[Atlantic hurricane]] on record to make landfall in the [[contiguous United States]], behind the [[1935 Labor Day hurricane]], [[Hurricane Camille]] in 1969, and [[Hurricane Michael]] in 2018. Katrina was also the earliest eleventh named storm in the Atlantic until [[2020 Atlantic hurricane season#Tropical Storm Kyle|Tropical Storm Kyle]] surpassed it on August 14, 2020, beating Katrina by 10 days as it was named on August 24, 2005.
