==History==
The initial proposal to establish a stock exchange for high-tech firms in China came in August 1999, which was a time when internet stocks were highly popular in the US. However, the plans were shelved for a long time, potentially due to the burst of the [[dot-com bubble]] in 2000 and the lost confidence in internet and technology stocks. ChiNext was finally inaugurated in Shenzhen on 23 October 2009.<ref>[http://www.szse.cn/main/en/chinext/ Shenzhen Stock Exchange official page about ChiNext]</ref>

The shares of the first batch of 28 firms made their debut on ChiNext on October 30, 2009, with a Total Market Cap value of nearly 11 billion RMB and a Total Negotiable Cap. Value of 7.8 billion RMB. Trading in each of these stocks had to be temporarily suspended on this day due to their prices reaching change limits.<ref>[http://english.people.com.cn/90001/90778/90859/6799005.html All stocks trigger suspensions on China's Nasdaq-style board under price-rise rules on first day]</ref> The second batch contained eight firms whose shares started trading on December 25, 2009. At the end of 2009 there were 36 firms listed on ChiNext. In 2010, a further 117 firms went public, increasing the total number of listed firms to 153. 128 and 74 firms went public in 2011 and 2012 respectively. As a result, there were 355 firms listed by the end of 2012.

The [[IPO]] market was closed in China throughout 2013. Therefore, no new listings took place on ChiNext during that year. In January 2014, there were 24 new listings following the decision of [[CSRC]] to reopen the IPO market. In May 2014, CSRC announced a change in rules that eased profitability requirements for firms seeking a listing on ChiNext.<ref>[http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/business/2014-05/17/content_17514780.htm China eases ChiNext Board IPO restrictions]</ref>
