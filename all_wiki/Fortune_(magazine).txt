==History==
''Fortune'' was founded by The Atlantic Monthly Company co-founder Henry Luce in 1929 as "the Ideal Super-Class Magazine", a "distinguished and de luxe" publication "vividly portraying, interpreting and recording the Industrial Civilization".<ref>Fortune prospectus. By Henry Luce. Fortune, September 1929, Volume One, Number Zero.</ref> [[Briton Hadden]], Luce's business partner, was not enthusiastic about the idea – which Luce originally thought to title ''Power'' – but Luce went forward with it after Hadden's sudden death on February 27, 1929.<ref>Henry Luce & His Time by Joseph Epstein, ''[[Commentary (magazine)|Commentary]]'', Vol. 44, No. 5, November 1967.</ref>

In late October 1929, the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]] occurred, marking the onset of the [[Great Depression]]. In a memo to the [[Time Inc.]] board in November 1929, Luce wrote: "We will not be over-optimistic. We will recognize that this business slump may last as long as an entire year."<ref name=works>{{cite news |title=How the World Really Works |author=[[Daniel Okrent|Okrent, Daniel]] |work=Fortune |date=September 19, 2005 |url=http://archive.fortune.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2005/09/19/8272901/index.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808034103/http://archive.fortune.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2005/09/19/8272901/index.htm |archive-date=August 8, 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref> The publication made its official debut in February 1930. Its editor was Luce, managing editor Parker Lloyd-Smith, and art director [[Thomas Maitland Cleland]].<ref>"Current Magazines". ''[[The New York Times]]''. February 2, 1930.</ref>
Single copies of the first issue cost US$1 (${{Inflation|US|1|1930|r=2|fmt=c}} in {{Inflation-year|US}}).<ref name=works /> An urban legend says that Cleland mocked up the cover of the first issue with the $1 price because no one had yet decided how much to charge; the magazine was printed before anyone realized it, and when people saw it for sale, they thought that the magazine must really have worthwhile content. In fact, there were 30,000 subscribers who had already signed up to receive that initial 184-page issue. By 1937, the number of subscribers had grown to 460,000, and the magazine had turned half million dollars in annual profit.<ref>{{cite news |title=Fortune |first=Laura |last=Massey |newspaper=Peter Harrington London |date=December 11, 2010 |url=http://www.peterharrington.co.uk/blog/fortune/ |access-date=August 10, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140812205608/http://www.peterharrington.co.uk/blog/fortune/ |archive-date=August 12, 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref>

At a time when business publications were little more than numbers and statistics printed in black and white, ''Fortune'' was an oversized 11"×14", using creamy heavy paper, and art on a cover printed by a special process.<ref name=uva>[http://xroads.virginia.edu/~1930s/Print/fortune/background.html Background] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170729045717/http://xroads.virginia.edu/~1930s/print/fortune/background.html |date=July 29, 2017 }}.</ref> ''Fortune'' was also noted for its photography, featuring the work of [[Margaret Bourke-White]], [[Ansel Adams]], and others. [[Walker Evans]] served as its photography editor from 1945 to 1965.

During the Great Depression, the magazine developed a reputation for its [[social conscience]], for [[Walker Evans]] and [[Margaret Bourke-White]]'s color photographs, and for a team of writers including [[James Agee]], [[Archibald MacLeish]], [[John Kenneth Galbraith]], and [[Alfred Kazin]], hired specifically for their writing abilities. The magazine became an important leg of Luce's media empire;{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}} after the successful launch of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' in 1923 and ''Fortune'' in 1930, Luce went on to launch ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' in 1936 and ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' in 1954.

From its launch in 1930 to 1978, ''Fortune'' was published monthly. In January 1978, it began publishing biweekly. In October 2009, citing declining [[advertising]] revenue and [[newspaper circulation|circulation]], ''Fortune'' began publishing every three weeks.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/10/23/fortune-magazine-will-drop-from-25-to-18-issues-a-year/ |title= Fortune Magazine Will Drop From 25 to 18 Issues a Year |author= [[Richard Pérez-Peña|Pérez-Peña, Richard]] |date= October 23, 2009 |work= [[The New York Times]] |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110324113155/http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/10/23/fortune-magazine-will-drop-from-25-to-18-issues-a-year/ |archive-date= March 24, 2011 |url-status= live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/10/23/fortune-magazine-will-drop-from-25-to-18-issues-a-year/ |title=Fortune Media Kit |date=October 23, 2009 |work=[[The New York Times]] |author=[[Richard Pérez-Peña|Pérez-Peña, Richard]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110324113155/http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/10/23/fortune-magazine-will-drop-from-25-to-18-issues-a-year/ |archive-date=March 24, 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref> As of 2018, ''Fortune'' is published 14 times a year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://subscription.fortune.com/storefront/subscribe-to-fortune/site/fo-bundletest2trm0118-tpl.html?link=1022055&fpa_oc=FO+0218+AA+Test+OWN|title=Fortune Magazine Subscription|website=subscription.fortune.com|access-date=2018-02-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180207182902/https://subscription.fortune.com/storefront/subscribe-to-fortune/site/fo-bundletest2trm0118-tpl.html?link=1022055&fpa_oc=FO+0218+AA+Test+OWN|archive-date=February 7, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>
