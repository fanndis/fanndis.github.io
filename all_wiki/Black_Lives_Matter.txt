[[File:Police killings in the USA in 2018.svg|thumb|250px|right|Map depicting rates of police killings by state in the United States in 2018.]]

According to a study from the [[Bureau of Justice Statistics]] from 2002 to 2011, among those who had contact with the police, "blacks (2.8%) were more likely than whites (1.0%) and Hispanics (1.4%) to perceive the threat or use of nonfatal force was excessive."<ref>{{Cite web |date=November 2015 |title=Police Use of Nonfatal Force, 2002-11 |url=https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/punf0211_sum.pdf|website=Bureau of Justice Statistics}}</ref>

According to ''[[The Washington Post]]'', police officers shot and killed 1,001 people in the United States in 2019. About half of those killed were white, and one quarter were black, making the rate of deaths for black Americans (31 fatal shootings per million) more than twice as high as the rate for white Americans (13 fatal shootings per million).<ref name=":1">{{Cite web |title=Fatal Force: Police shootings database |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/investigations/police-shootings-database/|access-date=June 19, 2020 |website=The Washington Post |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=People shot to death by U.S. police, by race 2020 |url=https://www.statista.com/statistics/585152/people-shot-to-death-by-us-police-by-race/|access-date=June 19, 2020 |website=Statista |language=en}}</ref> ''The Washington Post'' also counts 13 unarmed black Americans shot dead by police in 2019.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Stellino |first=Molly |title=Fact check: Police killed more unarmed Black men in 2019 than conservative activist claimed |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2020/06/23/fact-check-how-many-unarmed-black-men-did-police-kill-2019/5322455002/|access-date=August 27, 2020 |website=USA TODAY |language=en-US}}</ref>

A 2019 study by Cesario et al. published in ''[[Social Psychological and Personality Science]]'' found that after adjusting for crime, there was "no systematic evidence of anti-black disparities in fatal shootings, fatal shootings of unarmed citizens, or fatal shootings involving misidentification of harmless objects".<ref>{{cite journal |title=Is There Evidence of Racial Disparity in Police Use of Deadly Force? Analyses of Officer-Involved Fatal Shootings in 2015–2016 |journal=Social Psychological and Personality Science |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/325752754 |accessdate=July 9, 2020}}</ref> However, a 2020 study by Ross et al. criticizes the data analysis used in the Cesario et al. study. Using the same data set, Ross et al. conclude that there is significant racial bias in police shooting cases involving unarmed black suspects. This bias is not seen when suspects were armed.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Racial Disparities in Police Use of Deadly Force Against Unarmed Individuals Persist After Appropriately Benchmarking Shooting Data on Violent Crime Rates |journal=Social Psychological and Personality Science |year=2020 |doi=10.1177/1948550620916071 |last1=Ross |first1=Cody T. |last2=Winterhalder |first2=Bruce |last3=McElreath |first3=Richard |doi-access=free}}</ref>

A study by Harvard economist Roland Fryer found that blacks and Hispanics were 50% more likely to experience non-lethal force in police interactions, but for officer-involved shootings there were "no racial differences in either the raw data or when contextual factors are taken into account".<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Fryer |first=Roland |title=An Empirical Analysis of Racial Differences in Police Use of Force |url=https://scholar.harvard.edu/fryer/publications/empirical-analysis-racial-differences-police-use-force |journal=Journal of Political Economy }}</ref>

A study in ''[[PLOS One]]'' found "significant bias in the killing of unarmed black Americans relative to unarmed white Americans" by police. The average bias measure was that unarmed African Americans had 3.49 times the probability of being shot compared to unarmed whites, although in some jurisdictions the risk could be as much as 20 times higher. The study also found that the documented racial bias in police shootings could not be explained by differences in local crime rates.<ref>{{Cite journal |title=A Multi-Level Bayesian Analysis of Racial Bias in Police Shootings at the County-Level in the United States, 2011–2014 |first=Cody T. |last=Ross |date=November 5, 2015 |journal=PLOS ONE |volume=10 |issue=11 |pages=e0141854 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0141854 |pmid=26540108 |pmc=4634878|bibcode=2015PLoSO..1041854R |doi-access=free}}</ref>

A since retracted study in ''[[PNAS]]'' claimed that black people were actually less likely than white people to be killed by police, based on the death rates in police encounters.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Johnson|first1=David J.|last2=Tress|first2=Trevor|last3=Burkel|first3=Nicole|last4=Taylor|first4=Carley|last5=Cesario|first5=Joseph|date=2019-08-06|title=Officer characteristics and racial disparities in fatal officer-involved shootings|url=https://www.pnas.org/content/116/32/15877|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|language=en|volume=116|issue=32|pages=15877–15882|doi=10.1073/pnas.1903856116|issn=0027-8424|pmid=31332014|pmc=6689929}}</ref> A study published in the journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' that found such conclusions were erroneous due to [[Simpson's paradox]]. The ''Nature'' paper showed that it was true that white people were more likely to be killed in a police encounter, overall black people were still being discriminated against because they had far more interactions with the police due to structural racism. The paper noted that black people have far more interactions with the police per capita than white people, and that black people tend to get stopped for more petty crimes or for no crime at all. Conversely, white people tend to interact with police in situations more rarely, and often in more serious crimes such as shootings, where police are more likely to use force. Thus while it appears that white people are killed at a higher rate, the datasets are not comparable in such a simple fashion. The ''Nature'' paper also backed up the findings of Ross and Fryer, and concluded that overall rate of death was a much more useful statistic than the rate of death in encounters.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ross |first1=Cody T. |last2=Winterhalder |first2=Bruce |last3=McElreath |first3=Richard |date=June 5, 2018 |title=Resolution of apparent paradoxes in the race-specific frequency of use-of-force by police |url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-018-0110-z |journal=Palgrave Communications |language=en |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=1–9 |doi=10.1057/s41599-018-0110-z |issn=2055-1045|doi-access=free}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |date=June 11, 2020 |first=Aubrey |last=Clayton |title=The statistical paradox of police killings |newspaper=[[The Boston Globe]] |url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/06/11/opinion/statistical-paradox-police-killings/ |accessdate=July 9, 2020}}</ref>

== Structure and organization ==
=== Loose structure ===
The phrase "Black Lives Matter" can refer to a [[Twitter]] [[hashtag]], a [[slogan]], a social movement, a [[political action committee]],<ref>{{cite news |last1=By Janell Ross |title=Black Lives Matter launches a political action committee. But it's not an easy fit. |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/10/27/black-lives-matter-goes-official-with-a-political-action-committee-but-its-not-an-easy-fit/?arc404=true |accessdate=August 23, 2020 |work=[[Washington Post]]}}</ref> or a loose confederation of groups advocating for racial justice. As a movement, Black Lives Matter is [[grassroots]] and decentralized, and leaders have emphasized the importance of local organizing over national leadership.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Miller |first1=Ryan W. |title=Black Lives Matter: A primer on what it is and what it stands for |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2016/07/11/black-lives-matter-what-what-stands/86963292/ |accessdate=July 13, 2016 |work=USA Today |date=July 12, 2016 |ref=USA_BLM}}</ref><ref name=clayton>{{cite journal |last=Clayton |first=Dewey M. |title=Black Lives Matter and the Civil Rights Movement: A Comparative Analysis of Two Social Movements in the United States |journal=[[Journal of Black Studies]] |date=2018 |volume=49 |issue=5 |pages=448–480 |doi=10.1177/0021934718764099 |s2cid=148805128}}</ref> The structure differs from previous black movements, like the [[Civil Rights Movement]].

In 2013, [[Patrisse Cullors]], [[Alicia Garza]], and [[Opal Tometi]] formed the Black Lives Matter Network. Garza described the network as an online platform that existed to provide activists with a shared set of principles and goals. Local Black Lives Matter chapters are asked to commit to the organization's list of guiding principles but operate without a central structure or hierarchy.

==== Fake manifesto ====
In June 2020, an unknown party created a website at BLMManifesto.com purporting to be the manifesto of the BLM movement. The text mimics a 1919 Italian Fascist Manifesto, modified to relate to racial injustice. According to [[Snopes]], the website appears intended to discredit the BLM movement.<ref>MacGuill, Dan (September 17, 2020).

=== Insufficient focus on women ===
Women from within the Black Lives Matter movement, including professor and civil rights advocate Treva B. Lindsey, have argued that BLM has sidelined black women's experiences in favor of black men's experiences.
