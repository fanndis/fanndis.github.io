|quote = "The most vital lesson [Reid has] learned from 22 years working at record companies? 'That you keep the doors open and the lights on and a star will walk in,' he says. 'I learned to stay in business. People are still buying music, dancing to it and dressing like it. They're using it to sell cars and CoverGirl makeup, so we sell product lines with our artists. The popularity of music is at an all-time high. How we monetize it is sometimes a moving target.'"

In May 2000, Edmonds and Reid sold their remaining 50% stake in [[LaFace]] to parent company [[Bertelsmann Music Group|BMG]].

In 2000, [[LaFace]] was merged into [[Arista Records]] with Reid being promoted to president and CEO of [[Arista Records]]. In 1997 Reid attended the [[Harvard Business School]] six-week Advanced Management Program, in preparation to become CEO of [[Arista Records]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2000/may/03/business/fi-25917 |title=BMG Chief Strauss Zelnick Sens Reid back to school |publisher=Articles.latimes.com |date=May 3, 2000 |accessdate=December 23, 2011 |first=Chuck |last=Philips}}</ref> In 2000, Reid signed his first unknown artists, Havana Mena Latin/hip hop and pop/rocker [[Avril Lavigne]], to [[Arista Records|Arista]].

Following the merger of [[Sony]] and [[Bertelsmann Music Group|BMG]], L.A. Reid was released from his contract at Arista in 2004 and became the chairman and CEO of [[The Island Def Jam Music Group]] in February 2004. Reid is noted for bringing [[Mariah Carey]]'s career back to prominence with her multi-platinum 2005 album ''[[The Emancipation of Mimi]]'' after her career had stalled from 2001 to 2003 with less than stellar sales and general lack of public interest for her two previous projects, ''[[Glitter (soundtrack)|Glitter]]'' and ''[[Charmbracelet]]''.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

Reid also played a role in the successes of artists such as [[Kanye West]], [[Rihanna]], [[Bon Jovi]], and [[Justin Bieber]] and was credited for the musical comeback of [[Jennifer Lopez]] with her 2011 album ''[[Love?]]''.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} Reid stepped down as Chairman/CEO of Island Def Jam in March 2011.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

Reid was assigned the Boys category throughout the competition, aided by friend and singer [[Rihanna]] at the Judges' Houses stage of the competition in [[The Hamptons]]. His final four acts were [[Marcus Canty]], [[Chris Rene]], [[Astro (rapper)|Astro]] and Phillip Lomax. Lomax was eliminated on week one of the Live Shows, with Astro being eliminated on week six. [[Marcus Canty]] came fourth in the competition and was eliminated by the public vote in the semi-final (week eight). [[Chris Rene]] was Reid's most successful act who came third overall in the competition, bested by [[Josh Krajcik]] (who was mentored by [[Nicole Scherzinger]]) in second place and [[Melanie Amaro]] (mentored by Simon Cowell) who won the show. After the season ended, Reid worked with [[Astro (rapper)|Astro]], [[Marcus Canty]] and [[Chris Rene]] on their music careers.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}
