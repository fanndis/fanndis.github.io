'''''Too Big to Fail''''' is an American [[Biographical film|biographical]] [[Drama (film and television)|drama]] [[television film]] first broadcast on [[Home Box Office|HBO]] on May 23, 2011 based on [[Andrew Ross Sorkin]]'s non-fiction book ''[[Too Big to Fail: The Inside Story of How Wall Street and Washington Fought to Save the Financial Systemâ€”and Themselves]]'' (2009). The film was directed by [[Curtis Hanson]]. It received 11 nominations at the [[63rd Primetime Emmy Awards#Most nominated shows|63rd Primetime Emmy Awards]]; [[Paul Giamatti]]'s portrayal of [[Ben Bernanke]] earned him the [[Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Miniseries or Television Movie]] at the [[18th Screen Actors Guild Awards]].

==Plot summary==
''Too Big to Fail'' chronicles the [[Late-2000s financial crisis#Credit markets and the shadow banking system|2008 financial meltdown]], focusing on the actions of [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|U.S. Treasury Secretary]] [[Henry Paulson]] ([[William Hurt]]) and [[Ben Bernanke]] ([[Paul Giamatti]]), Chairman of the [[Federal Reserve System]], to contain the problems during the period of August 2008 to October 13, 2008. The film starts with clips of news reports about the mortgage industry crisis and the forced sale of the troubled [[Bear Stearns]] to [[JPMorgan Chase]], with Fed guarantees.

With Bear Stearns out of the picture, [[Short (finance)|short sellers]] have turned their attention on [[Lehman Brothers]]. In need of capital, CEO [[Dick Fuld]] ([[James Woods]]) reluctantly fires COO Joe Gregory and CFO Erin Callan, naming Bart McDade as the new president and COO. McDade negotiates a deal with Korean investors, but the deal falls through when Fuld interrupts the negotiations and tries to convince the Koreans that they are undervaluing the [[Toxic asset|toxic]] real estate assets.

Paulson is adamant that the government will not subsidize any more acquisitions, but it becomes clear the most promising buyer for Lehman, [[Bank of America]], is uninterested without Fed involvement. Paulson and [[President of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York]] [[Timothy Geithner]] ([[Billy Crudup]]) gather the leaders of the biggest banks, including [[Goldman Sachs]] CEO [[Lloyd Blankfein]] ([[Evan Handler]]), [[JPMorgan Chase]] CEO [[Jamie Dimon]] ([[Bill Pullman]]), and [[Morgan Stanley]] CEO [[John J. Mack|John Mack]] ([[Tony Shalhoub]]), to convince them to underwrite the deal themselves. During a break in negotiations, another threatened firm, [[Merrill Lynch]], approaches Bank of America to buy them instead, which Paulson tacitly okays. With Bank of America purchasing Merrill Lynch, the only other buyer is British firm [[Barclays]], but their involvement is blocked by [[Financial Services Authority|British banking regulators]]. Lehman collapses and is forced into [[bankruptcy]]. Meanwhile, insurance firm [[AIG]] also begins to fail.

Lehman's collapse affects the entire financial market, and the stock market goes into freefall. Blankfein, Mack, and [[General Electric]] CEO [[Jeffrey Immelt]] inform Paulson they are unable to do business, and [[Minister of the Economy, Finances and Industry (France)|French Finance Minister]] [[Christine Lagarde]] warns him that he must not allow AIG to fail. Unlike Lehman, the Treasury rescues AIG with an $85 billion loan.

Bernanke argues that the [[United States Congress|Congress]] must pass legislation to authorize any continued intervention by the Fed or the Treasury. With the availability of [[credit (finance)|credit]] drying up, Paulson's plan is to buy the [[toxic assets]] from the banks to take the risk off their books and increase their cash reserves. Bernanke and Paulson lobby Congress, with Bernanke emphasizing the potential of fallout worse than the [[Great Depression]] if they fail to act. Paulson threatens [[U.S. Senator]] and Presidential candidate [[John McCain]] not to interfere and begs [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] [[Nancy Pelosi]] not to back away from the negotiations. After a wave of panic and personal haranguing from [[U.S. President|President]] [[George W. Bush]], the [[Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008|legislation passes]] on a second attempt and the [[Troubled Asset Relief Program]] (TARP) is created.

Paulson's team realizes that buying toxic assets will take too long, leaving direct capital injects into the banks as their only option to use TARP to get credit flowing again. Along with [[FDIC]] Chair [[Sheila Bair]], Paulson informs the banks that they will receive mandatory capital injections. The banks eventually agree, but Paulson's staff laments that the parties who caused the crisis are being allowed to dictate the terms of how they should use the billions with which they are being bailed out. An epilogue notes that bank mergers continued in the wake of the crisis, and that now only ten financial institutions hold 77% of all U.S. banking assets and have been declared [[too big to fail]].
