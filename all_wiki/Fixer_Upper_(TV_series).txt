Thanks to the show's popularity, the homes featured on the show have become desirable to either purchase or rent. At least six of the homes are available to rent through [[Airbnb]] or [[VRBO]]. Owners are renting them for anywhere from $250 to $350 a night.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Hoover |first1=Carl |title='Fixer Upper' houses becoming popular vacation rentals around Waco |url=https://www.wacotrib.com/news/business/fixer-upper-houses-becoming-popular-vacation-rentals-around-waco/article_8c38ba57-31db-5b22-8fe6-a8b46fc92f82.html |website=Waco Tribune-Herald |publisher=Waco Tribune-Herald |accessdate=1 August 2018}}</ref>

Selling the homes renovated by the Gaineses has also become a way for show participants to make a profit. The Bicycle House featured in Season 1, Episode 12 went up for sale in 2016 for $350,000 after being purchased for less than $50,000.

== Legal issues ==
On April 27, 2017, Chip Gaines was named in a fraud lawsuit filed by former business partners. The former partners alleged that the Gaineses persuaded them to sell their interest in Magnolia Realty to him for $2,500 each without disclosing plans that had been in the works to develop the ''Fixer Upper'' reality television show.<ref>{{cite web|author=By TOMMY WITHERSPOON twitherspoon@wacotrib.com |url=http://www.wacotrib.com/news/business/former-magnolia-partners-allege-fraud-sue-chip-gaines/article_7103f606-e1cb-5520-b430-1da8e816cf56.html |title=Former Magnolia partners allege fraud, sue Chip Gaines &#124; Business |publisher=wacotrib.com |date= |accessdate=2017-04-28}}</ref>

His attorney, Jordan Mayfield, told [[KWTX-TV]], the [[CBS]] [[television station]] in [[Waco, Texas]], "We are confident that these claims will be found to be meritless, and it is disappointing to see people try to take advantage of the hard work and success of Chip and Joanna Gaines."<ref>Carroll,

In another matter, in June 2017, it was announced that they "settled with the United States Environmental Protection Agency over allegations that they violated rules for the safe handling of lead paint during home renovations." They paid $40,000 in fines and will comply with such regulations going forward, and "remain committed to raising awareness in our community and our industry."<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/07/us/chip-joanna-gaines-fixer-upper-lead-paint.html|title=HGTV's Chip and Joanna Gaines Will Pay Fine Over Lead Paint Violations|access-date=2018-11-26|language=en}}</ref>
