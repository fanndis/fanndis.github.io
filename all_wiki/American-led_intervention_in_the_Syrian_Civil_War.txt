The '''American-led intervention in the Syrian Civil War''' refers to the [[United States]]-led support of the [[Syrian rebels]] and the [[Syrian Democratic Forces]] (SDF) during the course of the [[Syrian Civil War]], including [[Combined Joint Task Force - Operation Inherent Resolve]] (CJTF-OIR), the active military operation led by the United States, and involving the militaries of the [[United Kingdom]], [[France]], [[Jordan]], [[Turkey]], [[Canada]], [[Australia]], and others against the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] (ISIL) and [[al-Nusra Front]] since 2014. Since early 2017, the U.S. and its partners have also [[List of United States attacks on Syria during the Syrian Civil War|targeted]] the [[Syrian government]] and its allies via airstrikes and aircraft shoot-downs.

During the Syrian Civil War, which began in 2011, the U.S. initially supplied the rebels of the [[Free Syrian Army]] with non-lethal aid (e.g. food rations and pickup trucks), but quickly began providing training, money, and intelligence to selected Syrian rebel commanders. At least two U.S. programs attempted to assist the Syrian rebels, including a 2014 [[The Pentagon|Pentagon]] program that planned to [[Syrian Train and Equip Program|train and equip]] 15,000 rebels to fight ISIL, which was canceled in 2015 after spending $500 million and producing only a few dozen fighters.<ref name=nyt-3-8-17/> A simultaneous $1 billion covert program called [[Timber Sycamore]] ran by the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) was more successful, but was decimated by [[Russian military intervention in the Syrian Civil War|Russian bombing]], and canceled in mid-2017 by the [[Presidency of Donald Trump|Trump administration]].<ref name=nyt-3-8-17/> The [[Presidency of Barack Obama#Syrian Civil War|Obama administration]] began surveillance missions on Islamic State positions in Syria in September 2014.<ref name=whitehouse60002/> On 22 September 2014, the U.S., [[Bahrain]], [[Jordan]], [[Qatar]], [[Saudi Arabia]], and the [[United Arab Emirates]] (UAE) began to attack ISIL forces inside Syria,<ref name="abc22sept"/><ref name=saul70002/> as well as the [[Khorasan group]] in the [[Idlib Governorate]] west of [[Aleppo]], and the al-Nusra Front around [[Raqqa]],<ref name="US begins airstrikes in Syria"/><ref name=miklaszewski80002/> as part of the [[international military intervention against ISIL]]. By late 2015, CJTF-OIR planes were dropping or launching an average of 67 bombs or missiles a day.<ref name=time99002/> By August 2017, the coalition had flown 168,000 sorties in both Syria and Iraq (mostly against ISIL).<ref name="Airstrikes in Iraq and Syria 0814" />

The [[2017 Shayrat missile strike|U.S. missile strike on Shayrat Airbase]] on 7 April 2017 was the first time the U.S. deliberately attacked Syrian government forces,<ref name=jacobs21117/> and marked the start of a series of [[List of United States attacks on Syria during the Syrian Civil War|direct military actions by U.S. forces]] against the Syrian government and its allies that occurred during the periods of May–June 2017 and [[Battle of Khasham|February 2018]]. In mid-January 2018, the Trump administration indicated its intention to maintain an open-ended military presence in Syria to counter [[Iranian involvement in the Syrian Civil War|Iran's influence]] and oust Syrian president [[Bashar al-Assad]].<ref name="guardianopenend"/> In early September 2018, the U.S. began implementing a new strategy that sought to indefinitely extend its military effort, launching a major diplomatic push to achieve American objectives in Syria.<ref name=washingtonpost31117/> However, on 19 December, President Trump unilaterally ordered the withdrawal of the 2,000–2,500 American ground troops in Syria, which was initially set to take place in a 90-day period, and to be completed in 2019.<ref name=NYT2018-12-19a/><ref name=Time2018-12-19a/><ref name=Guardian2018-12-20a/> With proliferating concerns over a potential power vacuum, the U.S. announced on 22 February 2019 that instead of a total withdrawal, a [[Contingency plan|contingency force]] of around 400 American troops would remain [[garrison]]ed in Syria indefinitely, and that their withdrawal would be gradual and conditions-based, marking a return to a policy of open-ended American military presence in the country.<ref name=ahval41117/><ref name=cbs90009/> By the end of 2018, the SDF, assisted by [[CJTF-OIR]], had liberated over 20,000 square kilometers of territory, and three million Syrian civilians from the Islamic State.<ref name=usdof51117/>

In 2019, the coalition saw decisive results in its intervention against ISIL, when it [[Deir ez-Zor campaign (2017–19)|lost its last remaining territory]] in Syria in the March 2019 [[Battle of Baghuz Fawqani]].<ref name="battleover"/> ISIL leader [[Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi]] was killed during in a [[U.S. special forces]] [[Death of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi#Operation Kayla Mueller|raid]] in [[Barisha, Harem District|Barisha]], [[Idlib Governorate|Idlib]] in October 2019.<ref name=politico61117/> The Trump administration ordered all U.S. forces to withdraw from [[Rojava]] in early October ahead of a [[Turkish involvement in the Syrian Civil War|Turkish]] [[2019 Turkish offensive into north-eastern Syria|incursion]] into the region, a controversial move widely seen as a reneging of the U.S.'s alliance with the SDF in favor of [[NATO]] ally [[Turkey]].<ref name=bbc71117/> However, the decision was partially reversed by November 2019, as U.S. troops repositioned to eastern Syria, reinforcing their presence in the [[Al-Hasakah Governorate|al-Hasakah]] and [[Deir ez-Zor Governorate|Deir ez-Zor]] governorates, with the subordinate mission of securing SDF-controlled oil and gas infrastructure from the [[Eastern Syria insurgency (2017–present)|ISIL insurgency]] and the Syrian government.<ref name=ap81117/>

On 23 November 2019, the head of [[U.S. Central Command]] stated there was no "end date" on the U.S.'s intervention in Syria.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/11/25/no-end-date-for-u-s-troops-in-syria/|title=No 'End Date' for U.S. Troops in Syria|date=25 November 2019|access-date=6 December 2019}}</ref>

== Background ==
{{Further|Middle Eastern foreign policy of the Barack Obama administration#Syria|Arab Spring|Arab Winter|Syrian Civil War}}

[[United States diplomatic cables leak|United States diplomatic cables]] leaked by [[WikiLeaks]] have been seen as showing that [[United States involvement in regime change#2006–present: Syria|regime change in Syria]] may have been a covert foreign policy goal of the U.S. government in the years leading up to the civil war, even during the period when President [[Barack Obama]] was publicly engaging with Syria's [[Bashar Al-Assad]]. A 2006 memorandum by U.S. diplomat [[William Roebuck]] of the embassy in Damascus stated:<blockquote>We believe Bashar's weaknesses are in how he chooses to react to looming issues, both perceived and real, such as...the potential threat to the regime from the increasing presence of transiting Islamist extremists. This cable summarizes our assessment of these vulnerabilities and suggests that there may be actions, statements and signals that the [[United States Government|USG]] can send that will improve the likelihood of such opportunities arising. These proposals will need to be fleshed out and converted into real actions and we need to be ready to move quickly to take advantage of such opportunities.  Many of our suggestions underline using Public Diplomacy and more indirect means to send messages that influence the inner circle.</blockquote>According to [[Seymour Hersh]] and activist [[Robert Naiman (activist)|Robert Naiman]], Roebuck, who went on to be [[Chargé d'affaires|charge d'affairs]] of the Libyan embassy under Obama, also considered the advantages of promoting religious sectarianism in Syria.<ref name=naiman91117/><ref name=hersh01117/>

Following the start of the [[Arab Spring]] in 2011, [[Civil uprising phase of the Syrian Civil War|protests]] in Syria against the Assad administration were violently suppressed and a civil war began.<ref name="ISW-2011-12"/> By 2012 there were several armed opposition groups operating in the country, including the [[Free Syrian Army]], formed in July 2011 by officers who defected from the [[Syrian Armed Forces]]. In 2012, the [[al-Nusra Front]] was established by the [[Islamic State of Iraq]] as the official branch of ''al-Qaeda in Syria''. The al-Nusra Front was eclipsed by its own creator, and [[al-Qaeda]] severed its ties to the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] in February 2014, after an eight-month power struggle.<ref name="Politico-2014-5-23"/>

=== Pre-coalition arming and training of the Syrian opposition ===
{{Further|Timber Sycamore|CIA activities in Syria|Foreign involvement in the Syrian Civil War#United States}}

At the direction of U.S. President [[Barack Obama]], the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) was put in charge of operations worth about $1 billion annually to arm anti-government forces in Syria,<ref name="covert"/><ref name="trim"/><ref name="syria-aid-fears"/><ref name="larger"/> an operation which formally began in 2013, more than two years after the start of the civil war in 2011. Prior to 2013, the CIA only supplied certain rebel groups of the [[Free Syrian Army]] with non-lethal aid, but later began providing training, funding, and intelligence to selected rebel commanders.<ref name="autogenerated2"/><ref name="telegraph1"/><ref name="frontline-2014-05-26"/> Although a former intelligence adviser who spoke to journalist [[Seymour Hersh]] claimed the CIA had been facilitating the flow of arms from [[Libya]] to Syria in collaboration with "the UK <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[United Kingdom]]<nowiki>]</nowiki>, [[Saudi Arabia]] and [[Qatar]]" since 2012 or 2011,<ref name="Hersh"/> the first confirmed CIA weapons arrived in Spring 2014: "There were just a handful, delivered to only one rebel group carefully vetted by the CIA". The group, [[Harakat Hazm]], or the Steadfast Movement, showed off the new weapons system by posting the first successful strike on [[YouTube]] in April.<ref name="NPR17sept"/> Another of the groups being vetted was the [[Islamist]] [[Army of Mujahedeen]], formed in January 2014 specifically to combat ISIL.<ref name="NPR17sept"/><ref name=alarabiya13334/> However, there were indications that the Army of Mujahedeen was still being vetted in September 2014.<ref name="reuters30sept"/>

In addition to the covert CIA program,<ref name="WSJ_Feb172015" /> on 17 September 2014 the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] voted to authorize the executive branch to overtly [[Syrian Train and Equip Program|train and equip]] Syrian rebels against ISIL forces, at a cost of $500 million.<ref name=nypost23334/><ref name=zengerle53334/><ref name=mcbride63334/>

=== July 2014 rescue mission ===
{{Main|2014 American rescue mission in Syria}}
<!--Summarize and condense. Main article already included-->
Following the abduction of a number of foreigners in Syria, on 4 July 2014, the U.S. carried out an operation to rescue foreign hostages being held by ISIL. U.S. airstrikes were conducted against an ISIL military base known as the "Osama bin Laden Camp" while at the same time, two dozen [[US special forces]] soldiers parachuted from helicopters near an ISIL-held building, thought to be for high-value prisoners. No prisoners were found in the building and the soldiers were quickly engaged by ISIL forces dispatched from [[Raqqa]], which started a three-hour firefight.<ref name="telegraph.co.uk"/> U.S. forces concluded that the hostages were no longer at the site and abandoned the rescue attempt. At least five ISIL fighters were killed and one U.S. soldier was wounded. Jordanian forces were also reportedly involved in the operation, with one Jordanian soldier reportedly wounded, but Jordanian involvement was not confirmed. Later on, it was reported that the hostages had been moved 24 hours before the attempted rescue.<ref name="telegraph.co.uk"/> Following the mission, it was still unclear whether the operation failed due to bad intelligence or whether ISIL forces were alerted in advance of the mission.<ref name=hennigan73334/>

In the aftermath of the rescue mission, and purportedly as a response to airstrikes in Iraq, ISIL beheaded three hostages over a one-month period: Americans [[James Foley (journalist)|James Foley]]<ref name="telegraph.co.uk"/> and [[Steven Sotloff]] on 19 August and 2 September respectively,{{citation needed|date=November 2019}} and Briton [[David Cawthorne Haines|David Haines]] on 13 September.<ref name=botelho83334/>

=== Surveillance flights over Syria ===
On 26 August 2014, the U.S. began sending [[Aerial reconnaissance|surveillance flights]], including [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|drones]], over Syria to gather intelligence on ISIL targets. The flights began gathering intelligence that would aid future airstrikes even though airstrikes were not yet authorized at that point.<ref name=pace93334/> No approval was sought from the Assad government for flights entering Syrian airspace.<ref name=nissenbaum03334/>

== U.S.-led coalition against ISIL ==
{{main| Military intervention against ISIL#International coalitions against ISIS}}
The United States had since 2014 led efforts to establish a global coalition to counter ISIL.<ref name=eurparlcoal/>

On 5 September, 15 September<ref name=franceinthenews15556/> and 3 December 2014, various sets of countries came together to discuss concerted action against ISIL. Present at all three meetings were the United States, United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, Canada, [[Turkey]] and [[Denmark]].

The coalition of 5 September (10 countries) decided to support anti-ISIL forces in Iraq and Syria.<ref name=TIME5Sep/> On 10 September 2014, U.S. president Barack Obama announced a ″comprehensive″ strategy to counter ISIL that ″in concert with
coalition partners <...> will defeat ISIL and deny them safe haven″.<ref name=archives25556/>

The coalition of 3 December 2014 (sixty countries) that styled itself as the ''Global Coalition to Counter the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL)''<ref name=USstate,3Dec/> agreed on a many-sided strategy against ISIL, including cutting off ISIL's financing and funding and exposing ISIL's true nature.<ref name="USstate,3Dec" /> As of March 2015, the U.S.-led coalition comprised over sixty countries, that contributed in various ways to the effort.<ref name="eurparlcoal" />

===Support for Kurdish-led ground forces===
As the [[Siege of Kobanî]] continued there were growing calls to also arm the [[People's Protection Units|YPG]], also known as the People's Protection Units, a Kurdish fighting force in Syria heavily involved in the defense of Kobanî.<ref name=zaman35556/> On 20 October 2014, the Turkish [[List of Ministers of Foreign Affairs (Turkey)|foreign minister]], [[Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu]] announced that the Turkish government would be allowing [[Peshmerga]] from the [[Kurdistan Regional Government|Iraqi Kurdistan Regional Government]] to cross their border into Kobanî to support Kurdish fighters.<ref name=beck45556/> The change in policy came after the Turkish government had refused to allow Kurdish fighters and supplies to pass through the border to [[People's Protection Units|YPG]] units in Kobanî, as it viewed the YPG as an offshoot of the [[Kurdistan Workers' Party|PKK]].<ref name=pandey55556/> On 28 October, [[Peshmerga]] from the [[Kurdistan Regional Government|Iraqi Kurdistan Regional Government]] departed [[Erbil]] to travel to [[Turkey]] and eventually to Kobanî.<ref name="peshmergaerbil"/> A total of 152 soldiers were deployed starting with forty vehicles carrying weapons, artillery, and machine guns, along with 80 Peshmerga forces, who crossed the border into Turkey by land with the heavy weapons and then drove to the border near Kobanî.<ref name="peshmergaerbil" /> The other 72 soldiers in the contingent flew to Turkey and rejoined the rest of the contingent on 29 October.<ref name="peshmergaerbil" /> By the start of November, 152 Kurdish Peshmerga from Iraq and 50 [[Free Syrian Army]] fighters had crossed the border into Kobanî with heavy weapons, small arms, and ammunition.<ref name="nytpeshmerga"/><ref name="bbcpeshmerga"/>

On 20 October 2014, the United States began airdropping supplies to [[Syrian Kurdistan|Syrian Kurdish]] forces, including the [[People's Protection Units|YPG]], that were besieging ISIL-controlled Kobanî.<ref name="CNNairdrop"/> Prior to 20 October, the United States and its anti-ISIL coalition partners in Syria had not provided any supplies to Kurdish forces in their fight against the jihadist group.<ref name=CNNairdrop/> Much of the reason for the U.S. airdropping supplies was due to the Turkish government's refusal to allow supplies to pass through their border into Kobanî. The U.S. specifically airdropped weapons, ammunition, and medical supplies supplied by [[Iraqi Kurdistan]] intended to supply the Kurdish forces in Syria.<ref name=CNNairdrop/> On 21 October, a video was released by ISIL showing what it claimed was a bundle of airdropped small arms, ammunition, and other supplies from the United States. The Pentagon said it was analyzing the video and could not at the time confirm whether the video was authentic but that the materials were similar; the video would subsequently be analyzed by the Department of Defense to verify its authenticity.<ref name=bbc65556/> On 22 October, the Pentagon confirmed that one of its airdrops had been intercepted by ISIL elements but downplayed the incident, saying that it most likely would not give ISIL any real advantage in their overall operations.<ref name=defense75556/>

=== Coalition arming and training of the Syrian opposition ===
{{Main|Syrian Train and Equip Program}}
In October 2014, the Turkish government agreed to help train and equip some moderate Syrian rebels in [[Turkey]].<ref name=entous05556/> By January 2015, the United States was set to send 400 troops and hundreds of support staff to countries neighboring Syria in order to train 5,000 opposition soldiers a year for the next three years.<ref name=a85556/> The countries taking part in the train-and-equip program were to include Jordan, Qatar and Saudi Arabia, as well as Turkey.<ref name=Reuters_Feb2015/> The groups that were expected to be armed and trained by the U.S. government included fighters from the [[Free Syrian Army]].<ref name=mcclam95556/>  [[The Pentagon]] confirmed that it had selected 1,200 Syrian opposition members to begin training in March 2015, with 3,000 to complete training by the end of 2015.<ref name="Reuters_Feb2015"/>

The successful experience in [[Siege of Kobanî|Kobanî]] had informed U.S. policy in regard to arming Syrian opposition groups other than the Kurdish [[People's Protection Units|YPG]], with plans to give other groups [[Technical (vehicle)|technicals]] equipped with radio and [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] equipment to call in airstrikes.<ref name="WSJ_Feb172015"/> [[John R.

However, only about 200 rebel fighters actually began training, the majority of whom left after being required to agree to fight only against ISIL and not the Assad government.<ref name=syrianobserver57774/> By mid-2015, only a group of 54 such fighters ([[Division 30]]) had been deployed &ndash; which was quickly routed in an ambush by [[al-Nusra]]<ref name=startribune67774/> &ndash; and a further 100 had been thus far finished training in Jordan.<ref name=sabah_20150715/> In September 2015, it was reported that a further 100-120 were being trained in a second wave,<ref name="small number"/> with 75 more Division 30 fighters reported to have re-entered Syria at the end of the month; they were immediately attacked by al-Nusra.<ref name="betray"/>

''[[Jane's Defence Weekly]]'' reported that in December 2015 the U.S. shipped 994 tonnes of weapons and ammunition (including packaging and container weight), generally of Soviet-type equipment from Eastern Europe, to Syrian rebel groups under the ongoing CIA [[Timber Sycamore]] operation.

In his address to the nation on 10 September 2014, U.S. President Obama announced his intention to bomb ISIL targets in Syria and called on Congress to authorize a program to train and arm rebels who were fighting ISIL and the Syrian forces of [[Bashar al-Assad]].<ref name=aljazeera07774/> For the first time, he authorized direct attacks against the militant group in Syria. In his address, he said the United States were going on offensive, launching "a steady, relentless effort to take out" the group "wherever they exist." Obama also announced creating of a broader coalition against ISIL.<ref name=zake12345/>

Commenting on Obama's address, Russian [[Foreign Ministry]] spokesman {{Interlanguage link multi|Alexander Lukashevich|2=ru|3=Лукашевич, Александр Казимирович|preserve=1}} opposed the U.S. intervention against ISIL in Syria "without the consent of the legitimate government" and said that "this step, in the absence of a UN Security Council decision, would be an act of aggression, a gross violation of international law". [[Ali Haidar (politician)|Ali Haidar]], Syrian minister of national reconciliation, said that "any action of any kind without the consent of the Syrian government would be an attack on Syria".<ref name="russiasyr"/>

On 17 September, the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]] approved Obama's plan to train and arm the Syrian rebels in their fight against ISIL. In a statement following the House vote, Obama said that the United States would not send military troops to Syria.<ref name=keefe22345/> The [[United States Senate|Senate]] gave final congressional approval to Obama's proposal the next day.<ref name=carter32345/>

The U.S. did not request permission from the Syrian government, nor did it coordinate its actions with the Syrian government, provide direct notification to the Syrian military or give indication of timing on specific targets, but it did notify the Syrian U.N. representative, which the Syrian government confirmed.<ref name="voasyriaairstrikes"/>

Before the airstrikes began, the United States also informed [[Iran]], the Assad government's largest regional ally, of their intention to launch airstrikes. It did not share specific timing or targets of strikes with the Iranian government but reportedly assured it that the US would not strike any Syrian government targets.<ref name=mohammed42345/>

One of the groups targeted by U.S. airstrikes was the [[Khorasan (Islamist group)|Khorasan Group]], an [[Islamic extremism|extremist]] group of suspected al-Qaeda "core" members who were alleged to have been plotting an attack against the U.S. and other Western nations.<ref name=voasyriaairstrikes/> The strikes targeted Khorasan training camps, explosives and munitions production facilities, communications facilities, as well as command and control facilities. The group has been claimed to possess advanced bomb making skills and their plot is claimed to involve a bomb made of a nonmetallic device such as a toothpaste container or clothes dipped in explosive material.<ref name="khorasanairstrikes"/> The group is reportedly led by [[Muhsin al-Fadhli]], a leader of [[al-Qaeda]] and <span>a close confidant of </span>[[Osama bin Laden]].<ref name=khorasanairstrikes/> Intelligence officials expressed concern that the group may include militants who were taught by [[Ibrahim al-Asiri]], the chief bomb maker for [[al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula]], who is known for his sophisticated bomb making techniques that nearly downed two Western airliners.<ref name=khorasanairstrikes/>

Later statements by government officials indicated that the threat of a plot may have been less severe than initially reported.<ref name="nyt_mazzetti"/><ref name="guardian_ackerman"/> One official indicated that "there did not yet seem to be a concrete plan in the works",<ref name=nyt_mazzetti /> while another told ''[[The Guardian]]'' that "there was no indication of an imminent domestic threat from the group" at the time the United States began bombing.<ref name=guardian_ackerman />

On 6 November, a second round of airstrikes was launched against Khorasan and al-Nusra in northwestern Syria, along with [[Ahrar ash-Sham]] at its headquarters in [[Idlib]], whose leadership had been infiltrated by al-Qaeda.<ref name="edition.cnn.com"/> On 13 November 2014, the US launched a third set of airstrikes against Khorasan.<ref name=yah54645/> On 19 November, the US carried out another airstrike on Khorasan near [[Hazm, Hama|Hazm]], which struck and destroyed a storage facility associated with the group.<ref name="US carries out 4th raid on Khorasan terrorists" /> On 1 December, the US carried out another airstrike on Khorasan near Aleppo.<ref name="5thKhorasan" />

On 24 March 2015, it was revealed that the US airstrikes on Khorasan had killed 17 militants from the group.<ref name="Nusra Front quietly rises"/>

On 8 July 2015, a US airstrike near the town of [[Sarmada]] in [[Idlib Governorate|Idlib]], Syria, killed [[Muhsin al-Fadhli]], the leader of Khorasan.<ref name="bno" />

== Ground operations ==
{{see also|Al-Tanf (U.S. military base)|List of United States special forces raids during the Syrian Civil War}}
During the beginning of the coalition interventions, leaders, including U.S. President Obama, said coalition ground forces would not be used in the fight against ISIL either in Iraq or Syria unless they were local coalition forces.<ref name=wp64645/> While in Iraq thousands of coalition troops from the United States and other nations had been deployed in an advisory capacity, in Syria no ground troops from the coalition intervening in Syria were deployed in the beginning of the intervention.<ref name=cnn74645/><ref name=usat84645/>

===2015–16===
[[File:BatailledeManbij2.jpg|300px|thumb|right|[[Syrian Democratic Forces]] soldiers in [[Manbij]], 2016]]
In November 2015, the Obama administration began the deployment of U.S. special forces to Syria, on the mission of assisting rebel forces in their fight against ISIL, President Obama then ordered several dozen Special Operations troops into [[Rojava]] in northern Syria to assist local fighters battling ISIL, authorizing the first open-ended mission by American ground forces into the country.<ref name=nyt94645/>

ISIL's deputy leader in Syria, [[Abu Ali al-Anbari]], was killed by [[Joint Special Operations Command|JSOC]] special forces operatives in March 2016, in eastern Syria near the Syrian–Iraqi border, while he and three other ISIL members were traveling in a vehicle coming from [[Raqqa]]. The US Special Forces ordered him to exit the vehicle, intending to arrest him. When he refused and pulled out an assault rifle instead, US forces fired at the vehicle, killing him and the other passengers on board. US commandos also seized electronics and other documents during the operation for intelligence purposes.<ref name=wsj04645/>

In March 2016, [[Abdullah II of Jordan|King Abdullah of Jordan]] said that British forces had helped in the building up of a mechanized battalion in southern Syria, consisting of tribal fighters to combat the [[Syrian Army]].<ref name=tele15645/>

On 17 March 2016, the day after the declaration of the [[Rojava|Federation of Northern Syria]], U.S. Defense Secretary [[Ashton Carter]] praised the [[Syrian Democratic Forces]] as having "proven to be excellent partners of ours on the ground in fighting ISIL. We are grateful for that, and we intend to continue to do that, recognizing the complexities of their regional role."<ref name=hurri25645/>

[[File:US Special Forces in Raqqa, May 2016.jpg|thumb|right|[[Special Forces (United States Army)|U.S. Army Special Forces]] in [[Raqqa]], May 2016; one is wearing a Kurdish [[Women's Protection Units|YPJ]] patch]]
During the SDF's May 2016 offensive against ISIL in Northern Raqqa, [[Special Forces (United States Army)|U.S. Special Forces]] were widely reported and photographed to be present, with some of them wearing badges of the Kurdish YPG and YPJ on their uniforms.<ref name=db35645/> On 21 May, [[Joseph Votel]], commanding general of [[United States Central Command|U.S. Central Command]], completed a secret hours-long trip to northern Syria to visit several locations where there were U.S. special operations forces and meet with local forces the U.S. was helping train to fight ISIL. The visit came as the first of 250 additional U.S. special operations forces were beginning to arrive in Syria to work with local forces. The commander overseeing the war in [[Syria]], at the end of a long Saturday spent touring SDF bases, said "We do, absolutely, have to go with what we've got".<ref name=wpo45645/>

In September 2016, the U.S. spokesman for the [[Combined Joint Task Force – Operation Inherent Resolve]] (CJTF–OIR) confirmed that the SDF, including the YPG, is also part of the "vetted forces" in the train and equip program and would be supplied with weapons. The [[President of Turkey]], [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]], condemned this and claimed that the SDF are "endangering our future".<ref name=ara55645/>

In October 2016, U.S. Army Lt. Gen. [[Stephen J. Townsend]], the commander of the international coalition against ISIL, said that the SDF would lead the impending assault on [[Raqqa]], ISIL's then-stronghold and capital, and that SDF commanders would plan the operation with advice from American and coalition troops.<ref name=str55645/> From November 2016, more than 300 U.S. Special Operations Forces were embedded to train and advise SDF fighters in the [[Northern Raqqa offensive (November 2016)|Raqqa offensive]].<ref name=nyt65645/>

[[File:DVIDS - Video - Coalition supports SDF fight against ISIS.webm|thumb|U.S. Marines and Army Special Forces operating in support of the SDF in Syria, October 2018]]
In March 2017, the [[Trump administration]] deployed an additional 400 [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marines]] to Syria to expand the fight against ISIL in the [[Northern Raqqa offensive (November 2016)|Raqqa offensive]] where they could provide artillery support for U.S.-backed local forces that were preparing an assault on Raqqa to liberate the city from IS militants. The deployment marked a new escalation in the U.S.'s war in Syria, and put more conventional U.S. troops in the battle that, until then, had primarily used Special Operations units. The 400 Marines were part of the [[11th Marine Expeditionary Unit|11th MEU]] from the Battalion Landing Team [[1st Battalion, 4th Marines]]. They manned an artillery battery of M-777 Howitzers whilst additional infantrymen from the unit provided security; resupplies were handled by part of the expeditionary force's combat logistics element.<ref name=sal75645/> During the [[Raqqa campaign (2016–2017)|Raqqa campaign]] alone, this small artillery battalion fired over 40,000 shells (including 34,033 155mm), more than were used in the entire [[2003 invasion of Iraq]] and only 20,000 fewer than all those fired by the U.S. military in [[Operation Desert Storm]].<ref name=marc85645/>

In March 2018, SDF press secretary in Deir ez-Zor Mehdi Kobani reportedly told [[Sputnik News|Sputnik Turkiye]] that U.S. forces were building a "large military base" in the oil-rich al-Omar region of Deir ez-Zor as new equipment had been reportedly arriving to U.S. bases in Syria. The al-Omar oilfield is the largest oil deposit in Syria, and was captured by the SDF during their campaign against ISIL in October 2017.<ref name=almas95645/><ref name=oil05645/>

On 8 April 2018, U.S. President Donald Trump called Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad "Animal Assad", following suspected chemical attack carried out in the Syrian city of [[Douma, Syria|Douma]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2018/04/08/politics/donald-trump-syria-assad/index.html|title=Trump blames Putin, Obama for 'Animal Assad,' tweets 'big price' after reports of Syrian chemical attack|website=CNN|date=9 April 2018}}</ref> On 14 April, the United States, France, and the United Kingdom carried out [[2018 missile strikes against Syria|missile strikes against Syria]].

It was reported in June 2018 that the [[441st Air Expeditionary Squadron]] reportedly maintained an unpaved [[runway]] in [[Sarrin]], [[Raqqa Governorate]].<ref name=twitte16645/><ref name=def26645/><ref name=mura36645/>

===2019 drawdown of U.S. ground forces===
On 19 December 2018, President [[Donald Trump]] announced that he ordered the pullout of all 2,000–2,500 U.S. troops operating in Syria, though no clear timetable was given.<ref name=twitte46645/> A day later, after failing to convince Trump to reconsider his decision to withdraw all American troops from Syria, [[Jim Mattis]] announced his resignation as Secretary of Defense.<ref name=nytimes20190102/> On 3 January 2019, Trump described Syria as "sand and death" in defense of troop withdrawal.<ref name=independent20190103/> U.S. operations in [[Al-Tanf (U.S. military base)|al-Tanf]] continued into 2019.<ref name=ral56645/>

On 16 January 2019, a [[2019 Manbij bombing|suicide bombing]] claimed by ISIL in the SDF-controlled town of [[Manbij]] killed four U.S. personnel and injured three servicemen, making it the deadliest attack on Coalition forces in the country since the intervention.<ref name=nbc66645/><ref name=cbs76645/><ref name=bbc86645/> The ISIL attack drew a second round of criticism of the U.S. president's withdrawal order, with critics linking the attack with an emboldening of ISIL terror and insurgent tactics due to the announcement of a U.S. pullout, despite the group's continued loss of territory in Syria.<ref name=cnbc96645/> President Trump offered condolences to the families of the slain American citizens on 17 January while he reaffirmed his policy of withdrawing troops.<ref name=wp06645/> Trump paid tribute to the fallen Americans during a trip to [[Dover Air Force Base]] in the U.S. state of [[Dover, Delaware|Delaware]] on 19 January, where their remains were received.<ref name=a17645/>

On 21 January, an ISIL [[car bomb|SVBIED]] targeted a U.S. convoy accompanied by SDF troops on the [[Al-Shaddadah|Shadadi]]-[[Al-Hasakah]] road in [[Al-Hasakah Governorate|Al-Hasakah province]], killing five SDF personnel. Witnesses said the SVBIED rammed into an SDF vehicle by a checkpoint held by Kurdish forces a dozen kilometers outside Shadadi as the U.S. convoy drove past. No Americans were harmed.<ref name=arabn27645/>

[[CNN]] reported on 24 January that additional U.S. troops were moved to Syria to help provide security for the pullout of equipment and personnel as they are moved out via air and land routes. U.S. [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] officials said the additional security forces would move around Syria to different locations as needed and may move in and out of the country at times. Troop numbers would also fluctuate as American presence gradually declines. Defense officials declined to give specifics on numbers, locations, or timetables, citing security concerns.<ref name=cnn37645/> Local sources reported to [[Anadolu Agency]] on 28 January that around 600 U.S. troops had allegedly entered eastern Syria from western Iraq to help with the withdrawal process, arriving at discreet bases in Harab Isk and [[Sarrin]] villages set to be used as main evacuation centers during the withdrawal. The news agency added that the American-controlled airfields in [[Abu Hajar Airport|Rmeilan]] and [[Tell Beydar]] would be used to airlift heavy weapons and equipment from the country; the Coalition itself did not confirm these reports.<ref name=almas47645/>

By the end of January 2019, according to two U.S. officials, more than 10 percent of American equipment and supplies had been removed from Syria, with 3,000 additional personnel brought into the country to facilitate the draw-down of forces. By 9 February, hundreds of U.S. airstrikes and ground support for the SDF continued as the Kurdish-led force began its [[Deir ez-Zor campaign (September 2017–present)#Final assault|final assault]] on the last ISIL holdouts trapped in a small cluster of hamlets in eastern Syria (including [[Al-Baghuz Fawqani]] and southern [[Al-Marashidah]]) no larger than a few square miles. U.S. officials, including President [[Donald Trump]], believed the SDF would be able to defeat the remaining diehard ISIL fighters “in days”, bringing an end to ISIL's claim of a territorial caliphate.<ref name=abc57645/>

On 18 February, [[Commander-in-Chief]] of the SDF [[Mazlum Kobane]] expressed hopes the U.S. would halt its total pullout. Kobane said there were discussions about perhaps French and British troops supporting them, but demanded 1,000–1,500 U.S. troops stay in Syria to provide "air cover, air support and a force on the ground" to help the SDF in its ongoing fight against ISIL. CENTCOM commander Gen. [[Joseph Votel]] reiterated the U.S. withdrawal was continuing.<ref name="auto1"/>

With the general withdrawal continuing, the [[White House]] announced late on 21 February that 200 residual U.S. troops would remain in Syria as a "peacekeeping force". The peacekeeping deployment would be indefinite.<ref name=nbc67645/> The next day it was revealed the actual number was 400 troops, not 200, as half would be based in [[Rojava]] and half at al-Tanf. Officials stated it was a part of an initiative to get NATO allies to commit to a multinational observer force that would establish a "safe zone" in Rojava to keep the Kurds and Turks from clashing, to prevent pro-Syrian government forces from attacking the Kurds, and to keep up pressure to prevent an ISIL resurgence. The U.S. is not seeking a [[United Nations]] mandate for the deployment and currently does not envision asking NATO to sponsor the mission, an administration official said, adding that the troops would not technically be "[[Peacekeeping|peacekeepers]]," a term that carries restricted [[rules of engagement]].<ref name=observerforce/>

On 7 March, Gen. Joseph Votel confirmed that U.S. forces were in no rush to pullout by a specific date, instead saying the completion of the withdrawal was conditional on ISIL no longer posing a security threat to U.S. forces and their allies.<ref name=alj77645/> By late March, the U.S. continued to stretch the timetable for the pullout. On 29 March, U.S. officials reportedly said the Pentagon's latest plans called for cutting its combat force in northeastern Syria roughly in half by early May 2019, or to about 1,000 troops, and would then pause pullout operations. The military would then reduce the number of forces every six months, depending on conditions on the ground, until it reaches the 400 troops previously approved by the president. Under this plan, the lowest troop numbers would not be reached until autumn 2020. The longer timetable would provide the U.S. more time to negotiate and work out details over the planned multinational safe zone along Turkey's border. Officials cautioned that the timetable was open-ended and still subject to change, with factors  ranging from allied troop contributions to new orders from the president himself.<ref name=nyt87645/>

In early May, video emerged online of U.S. forces firing upon an alleged Syrian government barge ferrying oil supplies in the Middle Euphrates River Valley. The video was posted on Facebook by the pro-SDF "Deir Ezzor Media Center".<ref name=almas97645/>

====Withdrawal from north Syria====
Following the collapse of the August–October 2019 [[Northern Syria Buffer Zone]] agreement and subsequent [[2019 Turkish offensive into north-eastern Syria|Turkish offensive]], U.S. ground forces began deliberately withdrawing from many of their bases, outposts, and camps in north Syria around 6 October, including [[Manbij]]<ref name=nyt07645/> and the [[Lafarge (company)|Lafarge]] cement factory, upon "precipitous" orders from the [[Presidency of Donald Trump|Donald Trump administration]].<ref name=wsj18645/> Senior U.S. military officials said that troops abandoned bases as far south as [[Al-Thawrah|Tabqah]] and [[Raqqa]] and consolidated all personnel and essential equipment near Kobanî to await airlifts and convoys out of the country throughout coming weeks.<ref name=CNNwithdrawal1/> A U.S. official said the ~1,000 U.S. troops being withdrawn will mostly reposition in western [[American-led intervention in Iraq (2014–present)|Iraq]] but also possibly [[List of United States Army installations in Kuwait|Kuwait]] and [[Jordanian intervention in the Syrian Civil War|Jordan]]. From Iraq, U.S. forces could conduct cross-border operations against ISIL in Syria, as they had done so in the past.<ref name=cbs28645/>

[[File:DVIDS - Video - US forces retrograde from Syria.webm|thumb|left|U.S. soldiers remove equipment and prepare to retrograde from their base at the [[Lafarge (company)|Lafarge]] cement factory in north Syria, 15 October 2019]]
During the withdrawal, which was described in news media as a "scramble", reports emerged showing that U.S. and SDF troops had hastily stripped their camps and bases of sensitive materials but left fortifications in place, many of which became immediately occupied by Syrian government and Russian forces as they quickly moved into the region as part of a protection deal, established on 13 October, between the Assad government and [[Rojava]]. Video emerged online of Russian forces reportedly at an abandoned U.S. outpost near Manbij.<ref name=CNNwithdrawal1/><ref name=milit38645/> On 16 October, two [[Operation Inherent Resolve]] F-15 jets bombed their section of the Lafarge cement factory base, located between [[Kobanî]] and [[Ayn Issa]], "to destroy an ammunition cache and reduce the facility's military usefulness" as Turkish-backed militias advanced towards the area. "The location had been the headquarters of the de facto Defeat-ISIS coalition in Syria," Inherent Resolve spokesman Col. Myles Caggins III said, adding that "No U.S. forces or equipment were ever in jeopardy and remain within separate, secure facilities." SDF personnel burned their part of the base before departing.<ref name=fox48645/> On the same day, President Trump commented on the developments by describing the Kurds as "no angels", and about Syria, he said: "Syria may have some help with Russia, and that's fine. It's a lot of sand. They've got a lot of sand over there. So there's a lot of sand there that they can play with".<ref name="washingtonpost20191016"/>

On 18 October, after a "[[2019 Turkish offensive into north-eastern Syria#120 hour ceasefire|ceasefire]]" between Turkish and Kurdish forces was declared a day prior, U.S. Defense Secretary [[Mark Esper]] stated that the withdrawal was continuing and that the U.S. would continue to communicate with both Turkey and the SDF. A senior defense official stated that U.S. aircraft would continue to conduct intelligence missions over northeast Syria to monitor the situation there.<ref name=defone58645/> In late October, Esper said the U.S. forces leaving Syria would head into western Iraq. But after Iraqi leaders said those troops can't stay there, Esper said they will be deployed in Iraq only temporarily before returning to the U.S.<ref name="oil"/> According to ''[[The New York Times]]'', citing [[United States Department of Defense|U.S. Defense Department]] officials, by 30 October at least half of the original ~1,000 U.S. troops in Syria had withdrawn and was expected to be reduced to roughly 250 personnel, largely concentrated in the Deir ez-Zor region.<ref name=comeandgo/>

On 31 October, Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad called President Trump as the "best American president", because he is the most transparent foe, due to his audacity to take the Syrian oil.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/trump-bashar-al-assad-syria-war-sdf-troop-withdrawal-a9183221.html|title=Assad praises Trump as 'most transparent president' after Syria troop withdrawal|website=The Independent|date=3 November 2019}}</ref>

On 3 November 2019 U.S. and coalition forces departed their strategic military base near the town of [[Sarrin]]. U.S. forces removed all their equipment and were seen leaving the base in a convoy of tens of trucks. The base was one of the largest U.S. bases in Syria, a logistics hub that assisted in the anti-ISIL intervention.<ref name=isw68645/> On 10 November, U.S. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff [[Mark A. Milley|Mark Milley]] stated that at least 500-600 U.S. troops would remain in Syria and will not exceed 1,000 personnel.

By mid-November, Russian and Syrian government forces had quickly filled the power vacuum left behind by the U.S. in much of northern Syria.

The former Deputy Defense Secretary for the Middle East [[Mick Mulroy]] told [[Foreign Policy]] in an interview that the United States should’ve done absolutely everything they could to support the SDF and their continuation of our common goal in fighting ISIS and that the Department of Defense was totally opposed to the Turkish invasion. He said specifically, "my concern now is that our partners have to believe that we are in it thick and thin. It's not good to have it as a transactional relationship, like a business deal that ends just based on the advantage of one partner at that particular time. That's not how to most effectively be a partner in these common fights.

By 20 October 2019,<ref name=comeandgo/> after backlash from the [[U.S. Congress]], the Trump administration had conducted a partial reversal of its 6 October order to pullout 1,000 troops from Syria, instead confirming a newly dedicated mission to guard oil and gas fields and infrastructure in SDF-controlled eastern Syria from ISIL insurgent attacks. While U.S. forces continued to reduce its [[Sphere of influence|presence]] in northern Syria by the hundreds to avoid [[2019 Turkish offensive into north-eastern Syria|Syrian-SDF and Turkish fighting]], the U.S. simultaneously shifted more resources south and east into the oil-rich [[Deir ez-Zor Governorate]].<ref name=comeandgo/> Defense Secretary Mark Esper confirmed on 25 October that the U.S. will "maintain a reduced presence in Syria and deny ISIS access to oil revenue"<ref name=comeandgo/> and, in support of the mission, [[Mechanized infantry|mechanized]] and armored units would be deployed to eastern Syria to reinforce the U.S.'s presence there.<ref name="oil"/> Throughout late October-early November 2019, this contingent was reinforced with hundreds of new infantry troops joined by mechanized infantry [[Brigade combat team#Armored Brigade Combat Team|Armored Brigade Combat Teams]] (ABCTs) in [[M2 Bradley|Bradley IFVs]] and—according to unnamed sources—potentially tanks, redeployed from Iraq and [[Kuwait]], which was estimated to raise the number of U.S. troops in eastern Syria to around 500 at the time.

== Turkish involvement ==
{{Main|Turkish involvement in the Syrian Civil War}}
[[File:Combined Joint U.S., Turkey Patrols2.jpg|thumb|U.S. and Turkish soldiers conduct joint patrols, [[Manbij]] outskirts, 1 November 2018]]
[[Turkey]], a [[NATO]] member, [[Turkish involvement in the Syrian Civil War|has been involved]] in the [[Syrian Civil War]] since the beginning of hostilities. Turkey has trained and armed the Free Syrian Army and [[Al-Nusra Front]] ([[al-Qaeda]] in Syria),<ref name=inde98645/><ref name=ahram08645/> has been involved in certain [[Spillover of the Syrian Civil War#Turkey|spillover incidents]], been repeatedly accused of [[Collaboration with ISIL#Turkey|collaboration with ISIL]], and since 2016, [[Turkish occupation of northern Syria|occupied large sections of Syrian territory]] along the [[Syria-Turkey border]].

In October 2014, the Turkish Parliament authorized direct military action in both [[Iraq]] and [[Syria]], including using military force, as well as allowing [[Combined Joint Task Force – Operation Inherent Resolve]] members to use bases in Turkey.<ref name=alarab19645/><ref name="ReferenceA"/><ref name=cntv29645/><ref name=fox39645/> The same month, US Vice President [[Joe Biden]] accused Turkey of funding al-Nusra and al Qaeda, and said that Turkish President [[Recep Erdoğan]] had expressed regret to him for allowing thousands of [[jihadist]] [[Foreign fighters in the Syrian Civil War|foreign fighters]] to transit through Turkey on their way to Syria.<ref name=fp49645/> Erdoğan demanded an apology, adding that if no apology was made, Biden would become "history to me."<ref name=cnn59645/> Biden subsequently apologized.<ref name=bbc69645/>

Turkey also holds sovereignty over the [[Tomb of Suleyman Shah]], an [[exclave]] which had been located {{convert|27|km|mi}} inside Syria, where it maintained a small garrison of 38 [[Turkish special forces]].<ref name=bi79645/> In February 2015, the [[Turkish Army]] launched [[Operation Shah Euphrates]] across the border to evacuate its soldiers from the Tomb of Suleyman Shah and relocate the tomb. The Turkish convoy of 572 troops in 39 tanks and 57 armoured vehicles was given permission to transit through the [[People's Protection Units]]-held city of [[Kobanî]] ''en route'' to the tomb. One Turkish soldier was killed in what the [[government of Turkey]] described as an accident.<ref name=bbc89645/>

[[Anti-Americanism|Anti-American sentiment]] in Turkey has increased since the start of the [[Operation Olive Branch|Turkish invasion of northern Syria]] in January 2018 aimed at ousting the [[Syrian Democratic Forces]] from the enclave of [[Afrin District]]. A poll conducted in Turkey during the operation revealed that 90% of respondents believed that the United States is "behind" the [[Kurdistan Workers Party]] (PKK) and People's Protection Units (YPG).<ref name=wp99645/> After the start of the Turkish invasion, U.S. Secretary of Defense [[Jim Mattis]] stated that "Turkey is a NATO ally. It's the only NATO country with an active insurgency inside its borders. And Turkey has legitimate security concerns."<ref name=hurri09645/> Turkish Deputy Prime Minister [[Bekir Bozdag]] urged the United States to end its support for the YPG, saying: "Those who support the terrorist organization will become a target in this battle."<ref name=alj10645/>

===Third Turkish invasion===
{{Main|2019 Turkish offensive into north-eastern Syria}}
[[File:Turkish patrol.jpg|thumb|left|U.S. and Turkish soldiers rendezvous in the [[Northern Syria Buffer Zone]], 4 October 2019.]]
On 15 January 2019, the Turkish President [[Recep Tayyip Erdogan]] said he agreed with setting up a {{convert|35|km|mi|abbr=on}} "safe zone" in northern Syria, after engaging with U.S. President [[Donald Trump]] a few days prior.<ref name=alj20645/>

On 7 August 2019, after months of negotiations, Turkey and the U.S. reached a deal to create a {{convert|115|km|mi|abbr=on}} [[Northern Syria Buffer Zone|buffer zone]] in northern Syria along the [[Syria–Turkey border]] between the [[Tigris]] and [[Euphrates]] rivers. Separate from Turkey's own [[Turkish occupation of northern Syria|occupation zone]] in northern Syria, the deal was reached partly to prevent a potential future Turkish ground incursion into [[Rojava]] against U.S.-backed Kurdish forces. Under the framework of the deal, the U.S. and Turkey conducted joint troop patrols, and Turkish reconnaissance aircraft would be allowed to monitor the zone. Kurdish [[YPG]] and [[YPJ]] forces along the Turkish border dismantled their border fortifications, withdrew to a "security belt" alongside regular SDF forces, and removed all heavy weapons from the area. In turn, Turkey was not to conduct airstrikes or establish military observation posts in northern Syria, and was not to "occupy" the region, as administrative and civil rule was to be relegated to [[Syrian Democratic Forces military councils|SDF military councils]] and the Kurdish [[Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria]]. According to the SDF, the majority of the zone was not to include any cities or towns.<ref name=nyt30645/>

The buffer zone agreement was proven to be short-lived and collapsed on 7 October, after U.S. President Donald Trump gave his approval for a Turkish ground offensive into Rojava, and ordered the withdrawal of U.S. troops from northern Syria. The agreement was rendered fully obsolete on 9 October, when Turkey launched a [[2019 Turkish offensive into north-eastern Syria|ground incursion into Rojava]].<ref name=toi40645/> In response to the offensive, U.S. Senator [[Lindsey Graham]] warned that he would “introduce bipartisan sanctions against Turkey if they [[Operation Peace Spring|invade Syria]].” He said he would also “call for their suspension from [[NATO]] if they attack [[People's Protection Units|Kurdish forces]] who assisted the U.S. in the destruction of the ISIS Caliphate.”<ref name=inde50645/>

As a response to President Donald Trump withdrawing American troops from the Turkey-Syria border, former Middle East policy chief for the [[United States Department of Defense|U.S. Department of Defense]], [[Mick Mulroy|Michael "Mick" Mulroy]], stated that the United States “should’ve had long discussions; we should’ve done absolutely everything we could to support [the Syrian Democratic Forces] and their continuation of our common goal in fighting ISIS.”<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|last=Seligman|first=Lara|date=20 December 2019|title=We Just Capitulated|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/12/20/michael-mulroy-interview-pentagon-middle-east-iran-syria/|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=5 October 2020|website=Foreign Policy}}</ref> Mulroy expressed his opposition to both Trump's decision and Turkey's aggression by disclosing: “It was almost universal in the DoD that we were against the Turkish incursion.”<ref name=":0" /> Mulroy had said specifically: “My concern now is that our partners have to believe that we are in it thick and thin.

== Reports of civilian casualties and war crimes==
[[File:Coalition Airstrike on ISIL position in Kobane.jpg|thumb|right|A coalition airstrike on ISIL positions in Kobanî.]]
On 29 September 2014, several groups including the [[Syrian Observatory for Human Rights]] (SOHR), the Aleppo Media Center, and the [[Local Coordination Committees of Syria|Local Coordination Committees]] reported that U.S. strikes hit a grain silo in the ISIL-controlled town of [[Manbij]] in northern Syria, killing two civilians.<ref name=fox60645/>

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported ten airstrikes, also targeting various parts of the [[Idlib Governorate|province of Idlib]], killed at least one child and six other civilians. The group said at least 19 civilians had been killed in coalition airstrikes at that time.<ref name=alj70645/> The Pentagon reported it had no evidence of any civilian casualties from airstrikes targeting militants in Syria.<ref name=hill80645/> The United States has also acknowledged that its rules to avoid civilian casualties are looser in Syria than those for drone strikes elsewhere.<ref name="The Economist"/>

The SOHR and other activist groups reported that seven civilians were killed when an air strike hit a gas distribution facility near the town of al-Khasham is the eastern Deir al-Zor province on 17 October 2014 and three civilians were killed in an air strike on 16 October 2014 in the north east province of al-Hassakah. According to their reports, most of the civilians killed were fuel tanker drivers.<ref name=huffp90645/>

According to [[Reuters]], 50 civilians were killed in Syria by US-led airstrikes, from the start of the campaign in late September 2014 to mid-November.<ref name=reuters11745/> On 28 December 2014, a U.S. airstrike in the northern Syrian town of [[Al-Bab]] killed more than 50 civilians.<ref name="jail"/>

On 21 May 2015, the United States admitted it "probably" killed two children in bombings near [[Harem, Syria|Harem]] on 4 and 5 November 2014. These are the first such admissions of the campaign, and followed a military investigation. A similar investigation regarding an event in Syria is underway, and two regarding events in Iraq.<ref name=bbc21745/> Two adult civilians were also minorly injured in the Harem strikes. The deaths and injuries are attributed by the military investigation to unintentional secondary explosions, after the bombers hit their intended targets, linked to the [[Khorasan (Islamist group)|Khorasan]].<ref name=reuters31745/>
On 19 July 2016 a coalition led airstrike on the ISIL controlled villages of Tokhar and Hoshariyeh reportedly killed at least 56 civilians, including 11 children.<ref name=cabs41745/> On 3 August 2016, dozens of civilians were killed after an airstrike in [[Al-Qa'im (town)|al-Qa'im]], some sources claiming that 30 were killed.<ref name=in51745/>

[[Airwars]], which "maintains an extensive database of all known allegations in which civilians and friendly forces have been reported killed by the Coalition since August 2014", reports between 503 and 700 civilians were killed by Coalition airstrikes in Syria as of April 2016.<ref name="airwars.org"/>

[[File:Destroyed neighborhood in Raqqa.png|thumb|left|A destroyed neighborhood in [[Raqqa]] in August 2017]]
According to a report by [[Amnesty International]], the U.S.-led Coalition has provided falsified data to conceal the actual number of civilian deaths resulting from their bombing campaigns and is "deeply in denial" about civilian casualties in Raqqa. After an investigation by Amnesty International in June 2018, the U.S.-led Coalition confirmed that "coalition air strikes killed 70 civilians, mostly women and children – including 39 members of a single family."<ref name=amnsety81745/>

According to Airwars,<ref name=smh91745/> the strikes of U.S.-led coalition killed as many as 6,000 civilians in Syria and Iraq in 2017.<ref name=wp01745/>

On 2 May 2018, Britain's [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defense]] admitted for the first time that a civilian was "unintentionally" killed in an anti-ISIL [[General Atomics MQ-9 Reaper|drone]] strike on 26 March 2018. According to the MoD, the civilian was on a motorbike and entered the target area at the last minute. [[Secretary of State for Defence|Defense Secretary]] [[Gavin Williamson]] said the incident was "deeply regrettable".<ref name=bbc12745/><ref name=guard22745/>

On 25 April 2019 a joint investigation by [[Amnesty International]] and ''[[Airwars]]'' of over 200 strike sites reported that anti-ISIL Coalition bombing during the 2017 [[Battle of Raqqa (2017)|Battle of Raqqa]] had killed 1,600 civilians alone. [[CJTF-OIR]] reported the month prior that its 4-year operations over both Iraq and Syria amounted to 1,257 civilian casualties overall. "Coalition forces razed [[Raqqa]]...Amnesty International and Airwars call upon the Coalition forces to end their denial about the shocking scale of civilian deaths and destruction caused by their offensive in Raqqa," the investigators said in a joint statement. The Coalition responded that they "continue to employ thorough and deliberate targeting and strike processes to minimize the impact of our operations on civilian populations and infrastructure."<ref name=milit32745/>

By April 2020, ''Airwars'' estimated 8,267–13,168 civilian deaths in Iraq and Syria due to Coalition airstrikes, including 1,755–2,346 children and 3,609 named victims. The Coalition's own estimate of civilian deaths was 1,377.<ref name="Airwars 2018"/>

The U.S.-led air campaign inflicted heavy losses on the Islamic State and, alongside special forces operations, artillery strikes, and material and intelligence support to the SDF, catalyzed the loss of the bulk of [[ISIL]]'s Syrian territory.

According to CJTF-OIR, by May 2016, ISIL had lost 25 percent of the territory it possessed in Syria since the campaign began, mostly due to advances by YPG/SDF forces with heavy Coalition air support.<ref name=usat42745/> Overall, by the end of 2016 the U.S.-led air campaign against ISIL in both Iraq and Syria was estimated by the Pentagon to have struck 32,000 targets (including 164 tanks, 400 Humvees, and 2,638 pieces of oil infrastructure) and killed 50,000 militants, with approximately 1/3 of these losses taking place in Syria.<ref name="Airstrikes in Iraq and Syria 0814" /><ref name=cnn52745/> By December 2017, the Pentagon increased the estimate to 80,000 ISIL fighters killed by coalition airstrikes between Iraq and Syria.<ref name="once promised"/>

By 23 March 2019, the day of ISIL's territorial collapse in Syria, CJTF-OIR and partner forces had liberated nearly 110,000 square kilometers (42,471 square miles) from the Islamic State; as a result, 7.7 million people no longer lived under ISIL's "caliphate".<ref name=ih62745/>

== Reactions ==
=== Domestic U.S. approval ===
The intervention was conducted with strong domestic U.S. support; according to [[Gallup (company)|Gallup]] polling in 2014, 61% of Americans supported intervention against ISIL in both Iraq and Syria, while 30% were opposed, and 9% undecided.<ref name=gall82745/> A larger [[Chicago Council on Global Affairs|CCGA]] poll taken in 2016 showed that 72% of Americans supported "conducting airstrikes against violent Islamic extremist groups in Syria", while 58% also supported "sending special operations forces into Syria to fight violent Islamic extremist groups." Additionally, a slim majority (52%) supported "enforcing a no-fly zone over parts of Syria, including bombing Syrian air defenses." However, only 26% supported "sending arms and other supplies to anti-government rebel groups in Syria."<ref name=tcc92745/>

A [[CNN]] poll conducted between 17–20 October 2019, showed that 75% of Americans were generally concerned about the situation in Syria, with 43% saying they were "very concerned". 51% thought the U.S. had a responsibility to remain involved in the Syrian conflict (seven months after ISIL's final Syrian settlement had fallen), while 43% did not.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/24/politics/cnn-poll-syria-concern/index.html|title=CNN Poll: Most Americans are concerned about Syria and think it's likely ISIS will reemerge|work=CNN|date=24 October 2019|access-date=10 December 2019}}</ref>

=== Syrian reactions ===
* {{flag|Syria}} – A week before the first airstrikes, [[Ali Haidar (politician)|Ali Haidar]], the Syrian Minister of National Reconciliation, said that "any action of any kind without the consent of the Syrian government would be an attack on Syria".<ref name="russiasyr"/> However, despite Haidar's original statement, after the coalition campaign began, the Syrian government struck a more conciliatory tone with Foreign Minister [[Walid al-Moallem]] suggesting the airstrikes were an indication that Syria and the anti-ISIL coalition were on the same side.<ref name=bi02745/> Among the general Syrian population, a July 2015 poll by ORB International surveying 1,365 adults in all of Syria's 14 governorates found that 47% supported U.S.-led airstrikes on ISIL while 50% opposed them.<ref name=tcc13745/> Opposition to American airstrikes was strongest in ISIL-held territory, where 92% were opposed; support was strongest in YPG-held territory and government-held territory, where 87% and 55% respectively supported American strikes on ISIL.<ref name=opinion23745/>
* {{flagicon|Syrian National Coalition}} [[Syrian opposition]] – Hadi Bahra, the leader of the [[National Coalition for Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces]] called for airstrikes against ISIL before the intervention began. The coalition is recognized by 20 countries, the European Union, and the Arab league as the legitimate representative of Syria in opposition to the [[Bashar al-Assad|Assad]] government. Bahra said strikes were needed to weaken ISIL, a faction in the [[inter-rebel conflict during the Syrian Civil War]], so that the [[Free Syrian Army]] and other moderate opposition forces could oppose Assad more effectively.<ref name=big33745/> Despite Bahra's support, many Syrian rebel groups have criticized U.S. airstrikes for targeting only ISIL who are enemies of the Assad government, while not also targeting Assad government forces, the results of which could help government forces gain more ground.<ref name="The Economist"/> Meanwhile, jihadist groups within the opposition have portrayed the coalition as an anti-Sunni stooge of the Syrian regime,<ref name=thec43745/> while many Sunnis in Syria are angered that only extremist Sunnis are being targeted while mostly Shiite Assad forces are not targeted.<ref name=thec53745/> Some rebels defected to extremist groups as a result of the U.S. decision to strike jihadist groups other than ISIL, such as the [[al-Nusra Front]].<ref name=thec63745/>

=== International reactions ===
In a Pew poll taken in 2015, a median of 62% of people across the nations polled said they support American military efforts against the Islamic State group in Iraq and Syria, while a median of 24% were opposed. Among those in support were 78% of Lebanese, 77% of Jordanians, 48% of Turks, 53% of Palestinians, and 84% of Israelis, as well as 81% of French, 66% of British, and 62% of Germans.<ref>[https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2015/06/23/1-americas-global-image/#support-for-u-s-against-isis America's Global Image].

* {{flagu|Canada}} – [[Stephen Harper]], the [[Prime Minister of Canada]], said in October 2014 Canada would strike ISIL targets in Syria if the Assad government gave approval.<ref name=huffp93745/> New Prime Minister [[Justin Trudeau]] called President Obama almost immediately after coming into office to inform him that Canada will be ceasing air operations in coordination with Americans. Trudeau did not give a time frame.<ref name=cnn03745/>
* {{flagu|Czech Republic}} – [[Lubomír Zaorálek]], the [[Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Czech Republic]] supported the intervention against the Islamic State and said that it is important to keep supporting the ground forces in the battle against ISIS and the Czech Republic will keep providing military support to the [[Iraqi army]] and to the Kurdish Peshmerga. He also noted that air strikes would not defeat Islamic State. The [[Czech government]] said that ISIS is enemy not only for safety in the [[Middle East]], but also for security and stability in the [[Czech Republic]] and [[Europe]].<ref name=vlad14745/>
* {{flagu|Ecuador}} – The Ecuadorian government opposed the airstrikes in Syria without the consent of the Syrian government.<ref name=econ24745/>
* {{flagu|Egypt}} – Egyptian [[President of Egypt|President]] [[Abdel Fattah el-Sisi]] expressed his government's support for the international campaign against ISIL, and a spokesperson for the Egyptian foreign ministry echoed his statements by reiterating the Egyptian government's willingness to back the war against ISIL.<ref name=wp34745/><ref name=wp44745/>
* {{flagu|Germany}} – [[Minister for Foreign Affairs (Germany)|German foreign minister]] [[Frank-Walter Steinmeier]] questioned whether President Obama's plan was adequate in order to combat ISIL and said Germany had not been asked to participate in airstrikes nor would it participate if asked.<ref name="ISISspeech"/>
* {{flagu|Iran}} – Iranian [[President of Iran|President]] [[Hassan Rouhani]] condemned ISIL's actions but also called the airstrikes in Syria "illegal" because they were conducted without the consent of the Syrian government.<ref name=inde54745/> Iran's deputy foreign minister [[Hossein Amir Abdollahian]] was reported in Iranian media as saying that Iran had warned the United States that [[Israel]] would be at risk should the US and its allies seek to topple Syrian president Bashar al-Assad while fighting ISIL in Syria.<ref name=guard64745/>

* {{flagu|Netherlands}} – [[Mark Rutte]], the [[Prime Minister of the Netherlands]], showed understanding for the intervention against ISIL in Syria and said that his government was exploring options to contribute in the fight against ISIL.<ref name=dvhn84745/>
* {{flagu|Russia}} – Alexander Lukashevich, Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman, opposed the military intervention "without the consent of the legitimate government" and said that "this step, in the absence of a UN Security Council decision, would be an act of aggression, a gross violation of international law".<ref name="russiasyr"/> On 14 October, Russian Foreign Minister [[Sergey Lavrov]] questioned the motives of the intervention, saying "Maybe their stated goal is not entirely sincere? Maybe it is [[regime change]]?" He also questioned the effectiveness of the year long campaign "With, as far as I know, 25,000 sorties they [US-led air campaign] could have smashed the entire [country of] Syria into smithereens," continuing to remark that "positive results 'on the ground' are not visible". He also criticized the continued supply of arms to rebels, saying "I want to be honest, we barely have any doubt that at least a considerable part of these weapons will fall into the terrorists' hands." He continued to call for the countries involved to join a coalition made up of Russian, Syrian, Iranian, Iraqi, Jordanian and Hezbollah forces against what Russia claims is solely ISIL and al Qaeda, but the US has asserted is primarily non-jihadist opposition forces.<ref name=guard04745/>

: Dmitry Peskov, spokesman for the Russian President Vladimir Putin, described the US air strikes on the Shayrat airbase as "an act of aggression against a sovereign state delivered in violation of international law under a far-fetched pretext.... a serious blow to Russian-US relations, which are already in a poor state".<ref name="bbc.co.uk"/>

: Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov referred to the Sharyat attack as "an act of aggression under a completely invented pretext". He compared events in April 2017 to "the situation of 2003, when the USA, the UK and several of their allies invaded Iraq without the UN Security Council's approval - a grave violation of international law - but at that point they at least tried to show some material evidence."<ref name="bbc.co.uk"/>

* {{flagu|Turkey}} – The [[2015 interim election government of Turkey|Davutoglu Government]] called on the [[Grand National Assembly of Turkey]] to approve measures that would grant extensive authority to the President to launch military operations in both Syria [[American-led intervention in Iraq|and Iraq]], including the authority to send troops across the border, although it is unclear whether the Turkish leadership intends to act on that authority. President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has urged the establishment of a [[no-fly zone]] by coalition forces in northern Syria.<ref name=wsj15745/>
* {{flagu|United Kingdom}} – A spokesperson for [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]] [[David Cameron]] said the UK would not rule out airstrikes in Syria against ISIL.<ref name="ISISspeech"/> On 26 September 2014 Parliament voted 524 to 43 to approve action inside Iraq.<ref name=guard25745/> While visiting [[Iraqi Kurdistan]] in mid October, British [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] [[Philip Hammond]] said he saw no immediate demand from U.S. and Arab militaries for Britain to extend its airstrikes to Syria.<ref name=dstar35745/> British Defense Minister Michael Fallon said on 21 October that British Reaper drones and Rivet Joint surveillance aircraft would be starting intelligence-gathering missions in Syria "very shortly." <ref name="UKdrones"/>
* {{flagu|United States}} – In November 2019, President [[Donald Trump]] ordered U.S. troops to secure the [[Petroleum industry in Syria|oil fields in eastern Syria]], then said any remaining U.S. troops in Syria were there "only for the oil", and that the U.S. was "keeping the oil".<ref name="syriaoil">{{cite news |last1=Baldor |first1=Lolita |title=Trump OKs wider Syria oil mission, raising legal questions |url=https://apnews.com/251062e322ab4bba99251fe59c90540a |work=[[AP News]] |date=November 6, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Tharoor |first1=Ishaan |title=Trump's perplexing insistence on 'keeping' Middle Eastern oil |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2019/11/15/trumps-perplexing-insistence-keeping-middle-eastern-oil/ |access-date=June 14, 2020 |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=November 15, 2019}}</ref>
