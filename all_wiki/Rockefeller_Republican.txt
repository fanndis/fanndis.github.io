The '''Rockefeller Republicans''', also called '''Moderate'''{{sfn|Stebenne|2006|p=38}} or '''Liberal Republicans''', were members of the [[History of the Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] (GOP) in the 1930s–1970s who held [[moderate]] to [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] views on domestic issues, similar to those of [[Nelson Rockefeller]], [[Governor of New York]] (1959–1973) and [[Vice President of the United States]] (1974–1977). Rockefeller Republicans were most common in the Northeast and the West Coast with their larger liberal constituencies while they were rare in the South and Midwest.<ref>Reiter (1981)</ref> However Geoffrey Kabaservice states that they were part of a separate political ideology, aligning on certain issues and policies with liberals, while on others with conservatives and on many with neither.{{refn|group=nb|"In fact, moderate Republicanism was a separate political and ideological viewpoint that found adherents in all parts of the country, among members of all racial and ethnic groups, and along all points of the socioeconomic spectrum. It overlapped on some issues with liberals, on others with conservatives, and on still others with neither."{{sfn|Kabaservice|2012|p=xvii}}}} They often saw themselves as champions of "[[good government]]", contrasting themselves to the often corrupt [[Political machine|machine politics]] of the Democratic Party, particularly in large cities.

Rockefeller Republicanism has been described as the last phase of the "'''Eastern Establishment'''" of the GOP which had been led by New York governor [[Thomas E. Dewey]]. The group's powerful role in the GOP came under heavy attack during the [[Republican Party presidential primaries, 1964|1964 primary campaign]] between Rockefeller and [[Barry Goldwater]]. At a discouraging point before the California primary, political operative [[Stuart Spencer (political consultant)|Stuart Spencer]] called on Rockefeller to "summon that fabled nexus of money, influence, and condescension  known as the Eastern Establishment." Rockefeller replied, "You are looking at it, buddy, I am all that is left".{{sfn|Smith|2014|p=xxi}}

[[Michael Lind]] contends that the ascendancy of the more [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] [[Fusionism|fusionist-wing]] of the Republican Party,{{sfn|Lind|1997|pp=53-54}} beginning in the 1960s with Goldwater and culminating in the [[Reagan Revolution]] in 1980, prevented the establishment of a [[Benjamin Disraeli|Disraelian]] [[one-nation conservatism]] in the United States.{{sfn|Lind|1997|pp=45-46}}{{sfn|Lind|1997|pp=55}} In its current usage, the term refers to "[a] member of the Republican Party holding views likened to those of Nelson Rockefeller; a moderate or liberal Republican".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/rockefeller_republican|title=Rockefeller Republican {{!}} Definition of Rockefeller Republican in English by Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries {{!}} English|access-date=2017-10-31}}</ref>

The phrase "Rockefeller Republican" has come to be used in a pejorative sense by [[Movement conservatism|modern conservatives]], who use it to deride those in the Republican Party that are perceived to have views which are too liberal, especially on major social issues.{{sfn|Coffey|2015|p=63}} The term was adopted mostly because of Nelson Rockefeller's vocal support of civil rights and lavish spending policies.{{sfn|Coffey|2015|p=63}} However, historian Justin P. Coffey has stated that Rockefeller's liberalism is a myth,{{sfn|Coffey|2015|p=64}} with former Vice President [[Spiro Agnew]] pointing out that the reality was quite different, stating that: "A lot of people considered Rockefeller very liberal and very dovish on foreign policy, but he was not. He was harder than Nixon, and a lot more hawkish about the mission of America in the world".{{sfn|Coffey|2015|p=64}}

On a national level, the last significant candidate for president from the liberal wing of the party was [[John B. Anderson|John Anderson]], who ran as an independent in 1980 and  garnered 6.6% of the popular vote.  Locally, especially in the Northeast, liberal Republican officeholders have continued to win elections, including [[Bill Weld]] and [[Charlie Baker]] of Massachusetts, [[Phil Scott (politician)|Phil Scott]] of Vermont,[[Chris Sununu]] of New Hampshire, and [[Larry Hogan]] of Maryland.

== Political positions ==
In domestic policy, Rockefeller Republicans vehemently rejected [[American conservatism|conservatives]] like [[Barry Goldwater]] and the Economic [[Neoliberalism]] of [[Milton Friedman]] while holding beliefs in social policies that were often [[Cultural liberalism|culturally liberal]]. They typically favored a [[Social safety net]] and a continuation of [[New Deal]] programs and sought to run these programs more efficiently than the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]]. Nevertheless, Rockefeller Republicans also opposed [[socialism]] and [[government ownership]] and were strong supporters of [[big business]] and [[Wall Street]]. But rather than increasing regulation of business, they advocated for developing a mutually beneficial relationship between public interests and private enterprise to both fund economic growth and also promote a better society with increased investments in [[environmentalism]], [[healthcare]], [[higher education]], and infrastructure improvements. They were strong supporters of expanded educational opportunities, such as trade schools, state colleges, and universities with low tuition and large research budgets. They also welcomed an increased public role for engineers, doctors, scientists, economists, and businessmen over politicians in crafting policies and programs. As a result, many Rockefeller Republicans were major figures in private enterprise, such as auto executive [[George W. Romney]] and investment banker [[C. Douglas Dillon]]. Reflecting Nelson Rockefeller's tradition of technocratic problem solving, most Rockefeller Republicans were not committed to any particular ideology, having a pragmatic and interdisciplinary approach to problem solving and governance while advocating for a broad consensus rather than a consolidation of support. While Rockefeller Republicans are publicly regarded as moderate to [[center-right]],{{sfn|Libby|2013|p=77}} historians have generally struggled to place them on the American political spectrum, noting more similarities with the French [[Dirigisme]] or Japanese [[Developmental state]].{{sfn|Baldi|2012|p=51}}  

A critical element was their support for [[labor union]]s and especially the [[building trades]] appreciated the heavy spending on [[infrastructure]]. In turn, the unions gave these politicians enough support to overcome the [[anti-union]] rural element in the Republican Party. As the unions weakened after the 1970s, so too did the need for Republicans to cooperate with them. This transformation played into the hands of the more [[Timeline of modern American conservatism|conservative]] Republicans, who did not want to collaborate with labor unions in the first place and now no longer needed to do so to carry statewide elections.<ref>Rae. ''Decline and Fall of the Liberal Republicans: 1952 to the Present'' (1989)</ref>

In foreign policy, they tended to be [[Alexander Hamilton|Hamiltonian]], espousing [[internationalism (politics)|internationalist]] and [[Realism (international relations)|realist]] policies, supporting the [[United Nations]] and promoting American business interests abroad. Most wanted to use American power in cooperation with allies to fight against the spread of [[Soviet communism]] and help American business expand abroad. [[Richard Nixon]], a moderate [[political establishment|establishment]] Republican within the party's contemporary ideological framework, was influenced by this tradition.

== History ==
[[Thomas E. Dewey]], the [[Governor of New York]] from 1943 to 1954 and the Republican presidential nominee in 1944 and 1948, was the leader of the moderate-wing of the Republican Party in the 1940s and early 1950s, battling conservative Republicans from the Midwest led by Senator [[Robert A. Taft]] of Ohio, known as "Mr. Republican". With the help of Dewey, General [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] defeated Taft for the 1952 presidential nomination and became the leader of the moderates. Eisenhower coined the phrase "Modern Republicanism" to describe his moderate vision of Republicanism. After Eisenhower, [[Nelson Rockefeller]], the Governor of New York, emerged as the leader of the moderate-wing of the Republican Party, running for President in 1960, 1964 and 1968. Rockefeller Republicans suffered a crushing defeat in 1964 when conservatives captured control of the Republican Party and nominated Senator [[Barry Goldwater]] of Arizona for president.

Other prominent figures in the GOP's Rockefeller-wing included Connecticut Senator [[Prescott Bush]], Pennsylvania Governor [[Raymond P. Shafer]], Pennsylvania Senator [[Hugh Scott]], Illinois Senator [[Charles H. Percy]], Oregon Senator [[Mark Hatfield]], Maine Senator [[Margaret Chase Smith]], New York Senator [[Jacob Javits]], Arkansas Governor [[Winthrop Rockefeller]], Nelson's younger brother (who was somewhat of an aberration in the [[Conservative Democrat|conservative, heavily Democratic]] South), [[Edward Brooke]] of Massachusetts<ref>Gregory Giroux, "Edward Brooke Served in a Very Different Era of Senate Politics," 'Bloomberg News,' January 4, 2015 https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-01-04/edward-brooke-served-in-a-different-era-of-senate-politics</ref>, [[John Chafee]] of Rhode Island and [[Lowell Weicker]] of Connecticut.<ref>Alan Silverleib, "Analysis: An autopsy of liberal Republicans" CNN, May 6, 2009 https://www.cnn.com/2009/POLITICS/05/06/liberal.republicans/</ref> Some also include President [[Richard Nixon]].<ref>[[Halberstam, David]] (1993). ''[[The Fifties (book)|The Fifties]]''. The Random House Publishing Group. New York. {{ISBN|0-449-90933-6}}. pp. 312–315.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.alternet.org/newsandviews/article/641730/if_nixon_were_alive_today,_he_would_be_far_too_liberal_to_get_even_the_democratic_nomination|title=If Nixon Were Alive Today, He Would Be Far Too Liberal to Get Even the Democratic Nomination|date=2011-07-29|website=Alternet.org|access-date=2016-02-23}}</ref> Although Nixon ran against Rockefeller from the right in the 1968 primaries and was widely identified with the [[cultural right]] of the time, he adopted several Rockefeller Republican policies during his time as President, for instance setting up the [[Environmental Protection Agency]], supporting expanded welfare programs, imposing [[wage control|wage]] and [[price control]]s and in 1971 announcing he was a [[Keynesian economics|Keynesian]].{{sfn|Reeves|2002|p=295}} The men had previously reached the so-called [[Treaty of Fifth Avenue]] during the presidential primaries of 1960, whereby Nixon and Rockefeller agreed to support certain policies for inclusion in the 1960 Republican Party Platform.

Barry Goldwater crusaded against the Rockefeller Republicans, beating Rockefeller narrowly in the California primary of 1964. That set the stage for a conservative resurgence, based in the South and West in opposition to the Northeast Rockefeller wing. However, the moderate contingent recaptured control of the party and nominated Richard Nixon in 1968. Easily reelected in 1972, after his resignation Nixon was replaced as President by the moderately conservative Republican [[Gerald Ford]]. After Vice President Rockefeller left the national stage in 1976, this faction of the party was more often called "moderate Republicans" or Nixonians in contrast to the conservatives who rallied to [[Ronald Reagan]]. Four years after nearly toppling the incumbent Ford in the 1976 presidential primaries, conservative [[Ronald Reagan]] won the party's presidential nomination at the [[1980 Republican National Convention]] and served two terms in the White House.

By 1988, the Republicans had chosen [[Prescott Bush]]'s son [[George H. W. Bush]] as its presidential candidate on a conservative platform. Bush's [[1988 Republican National Convention|national convention]] pledge to stave off new taxation were he elected president ([[Read my lips: no new taxes|"Read my lips: no new taxes!"]]) marked the candidate's full conversion to the conservative movement and perhaps the political death knell for Rockefeller Republicanism as a prevailing force within party politics.

Ethnic changes{{clarify|date=May 2017}} in the Northeast may have led to the demise of the Rockefeller Republican.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} Many Republican leaders associated with this title were [[White Anglo-Saxon Protestant]]s like [[Charles Mathias]] of [[Maryland]]. Liberal New York Republican Senator Jacob Javits, who had an [[Americans for Democratic Action]] rating above 90% and an [[American Conservative Union]] rating below 10%, was Jewish. As time went on, the local Republican parties in the Northeast tended to nominate [[Catholic]] candidates who appealed to [[middle class]] social values-laden concerns, such as [[George Pataki]], [[Rudy Giuliani]], [[Al D'Amato]], [[Rick Lazio]], [[Tom Ridge]], [[Chris Christie]] and others, who in many cases represented the party's diversity more on the basis of religion and were often otherwise like their Protestant conservative counterparts on policy.

With their power decreasing in the final decades of the 20th century, many moderate Republicans were replaced by conservative and moderate Democrats, such as those from the [[Blue Dog Coalition|Blue Dog]] or [[New Democrat Coalition|New Democrat]] coalitions. [[Michael Lind]] contends that by the mid-1990s the liberalism of President [[Bill Clinton]] and the [[New Democrats]] were in many ways to the right of [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|Eisenhower]], Rockefeller, and [[John Lindsay]], the Republican mayor of New York City in the late 1960s.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Up From Conservatives|last=Lind|first=Michael|pages=263}}</ref> In 2009, [[CNN]] published an analysis describing how liberal and moderate Republicans had declined by the start of the 21st century.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/POLITICS/05/06/liberal.republicans/|title=Analysis: An autopsy of liberal Republicans|last=Silverleib|first=Alan|website=cnn.com|access-date=2018-07-08}}</ref> In 2010, [[Scott Brown (politician)|Scott Brown]] was elected to the Senate to fill the seat once held by Democratic Senator Edward Kennedy.

=== Challenged by the Tea Party ===
In 2010, several moderate Republicans lost their primaries or were challenged by the [[Tea Party movement]].  In [[2010 United States Senate elections|Alaska]], Senator [[Lisa Murkowski]], the ranking member of the [[Energy and Natural Resources Committee]], lost her GOP primary to conservative Tea Party challenger [[Joe Miller (Alaska politician)|Joe Miller]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/senate-races/116703-sen-murkowski-concedes-defeat-to-tea-party-backed-miller|title=Sen.

[[Mike Castle]], a moderate former Governor and Representative of Delaware, lost his primary to conservative "insurgent" [[Christine O'Donnell]], who depicted Castle as being too liberal.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/15/us/politics/15elect.html|title=G.O.P.

In upstate New York, GOP-nominated [[Dede Scozzafava]] was opposed by national conservatives within the Republican Party during her election bid for a congressional district: "National PACs upset with Scozzafava's support of the federal stimulus, EFCA, same-sex marriage and abortion rights poured on money and attacks".<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://observer.com/2009/11/the-collapse-of-dede-scozzafava-moderate-republican/|title=The Collapse of Dede Scozzafava, Moderate Republican|date=2009-11-01|work=Observer|access-date=2018-07-08}}</ref> She was pressured to drop out of the race, and when she did the [[Republican National Committee]] endorsed Tea Party-backed [[Doug Hoffman]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/01/nyregion/01upstate.html|title=Dede Scozzafava, Republican, Quits House Race in Upstate New York|last=Peters|first=Adam Nagourney and Jeremy W.|access-date=2018-07-08}}</ref>

=== Revival in the Northeast ===
"Liberal to moderate Northeastern Republicans were once as much a part of the political landscape as today's liberals from Massachusetts."<ref name=":0" /> According to ''[[National Review]]'', "At the state level, however, a kind of Rockefeller Republicanism seems to be rising once again in recent years" in New England and the Northeast.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nationalreview.com/2018/06/new-england-republicans-popular-conservative-roots/|title=Popular Republicans: The New England Enigma|date=2018-06-27|website=National Review|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-12}}</ref>

== Modern usage ==
The term "Rockefeller Republican" has become somewhat archaic since Nelson Rockefeller died in 1979. ''[[The Atlantic]]'' has referred to the election of Northeastern Republicans as being similar to "Rockefeller-style liberal Republicanism", even though the label is not necessarily used by the candidates themselves.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2015/03/the-bluest-republican/384969/|title=The Bluest Republican|last=Ball|first=Molly|author-link=Molly Ball|work=The Atlantic|access-date=2017-11-21}}</ref> The Rockefeller Republican label has sometimes been applied to modern politicians, such as [[Lincoln Chafee]] of [[Rhode Island]], who served as a Republican in the Senate, was elected that state's governor as an independent, and later became a Democrat and briefly sought [[2016 Democratic Party presidential primaries|that party's 2016 presidential nomination]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2006/0814/p01s02-uspo.html|title=Trouble for centrists: Is the Hill headed for a sharper split?|date=2006-08-14|website=CSMonitor.com|access-date=2016-02-23}}</ref> Some more conservative members of the Republican Party use the label in a derisive manner, along with other labels such as [[Republican In Name Only|RINOs]], i.e. Republicans in Name Only,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/09/donald-trump-2016-rockefeller-republican-214260|title=Take It from a Rockefeller (Republican), We Can Revive the GOP|work=POLITICO Magazine|access-date=2017-10-31}}</ref> The Establishment,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2010/09/17/rockefeller_republicans_107193.html|title=Rockefeller Republicans|last=Buchanan|first=Pat|access-date=2018-07-08|website=RealClearPolitics}}</ref> or "Acela Republicans," a reference to the [[Acela Express]] running along the eastern seaboard.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thefederalist.com/2015/07/02/a-field-guide-to-acela-republicans/|title=A Field Guide To Acela Republicans|last=2016|date=2015-07-02|website=The Federalist|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-11}}</ref>
