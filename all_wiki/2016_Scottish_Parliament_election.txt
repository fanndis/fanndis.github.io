The '''2016 Scottish parliament election''' was held on Thursday, 5 May 2016<ref name=fixed>[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2011/14/section/4/enacted Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011] section 4</ref> to elect 129 members to the [[Scottish Parliament]]. It was the fifth [[Next Scottish Parliament election|election held]] since the devolved parliament was established in 1999. It was the first parliamentary election in Scotland in which 16 and 17 year olds were eligible to vote, under the provisions of the Scottish Elections (Reduction of Voting Age) Act.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-33173488|title=Cut in Scottish voting age passed unanimously|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=18 June 2015|accessdate=27 April 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aboutmyvote.co.uk/register-to-vote/voting-age-in-scotland-lowered-to-16 |title=Voting age in Scotland lowered to 16 |publisher=About my vote |accessdate=27 April 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160729032025/http://www.aboutmyvote.co.uk/register-to-vote/voting-age-in-scotland-lowered-to-16 |archive-date=29 July 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref> It was also the first time the three largest parties were led by women.

Parliament went into dissolution on 24 March 2016, allowing the official period of campaigning to get underway. Five parties had MSPs in the previous parliament: [[Scottish National Party]] (SNP) led by [[First Minister of Scotland|First Minister]] [[Nicola Sturgeon]], [[Scottish Labour]] led by [[Kezia Dugdale]], [[Scottish Conservatives]] led by [[Ruth Davidson]], [[Scottish Liberal Democrats]] led by [[Willie Rennie]], [[Scottish Greens]], led by their co-conveners [[Patrick Harvie]] and [[Maggie Chapman]]. Of those five parties, four changed their leader since the [[2011 Scottish Parliament election|2011 election]].

During the campaign, a series of televised debates took place, including party leaders of the elected parties. [[BBC Scotland]] held the first leaders’ debate on 24 March, [[STV (TV channel)|STV]] broadcast the next on 29 March, and BBC Scotland hosted the final debate on 1 May.

The Scottish National Party won the election and a third term in government, but fell two seats short of securing a second consecutive overall majority.<ref name = "results">{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2016-scotland-36243712 |title=New MSPs to arrive at Holyrood for first day |work=BBC News |publisher=BBC |date=9 May 2016 |accessdate=9 May 2016}}</ref><ref name = "map">{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2016-36215186 |title=Election 2016: Before-and-after and party strength maps |work=BBC News |publisher=BBC |date=6 May 2016 |accessdate=9 May 2016}}</ref> The Conservatives saw a significant increase in support and replaced the Labour Party as the second-largest party and main opposition in the Scottish Parliament.

Although the SNP had lost their majority, it was still by far the largest single party in the Scottish Parliament, with more than double the seats of the Conservatives. Accordingly, Sturgeon announced she would form a minority SNP government. She was voted in for a second term as First Minister on 17 May.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-36300892|title=Sturgeon wins first minister vote|date=17 May 2016|via=www.bbc.com}}</ref>

==Date==
Under the [[Scotland Act 1998]], an ordinary election to the Scottish Parliament would normally have been held on the first Thursday in May four years after the [[2011 Scottish Parliament election|2011 election]], i.e. in May 2015.<ref name="ScotlandAct1">{{cite web |url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/ACTS/acts1998/80046--a.htm#2 |title=Scotland Act 1998 – Section 2 Ordinary General Elections |publisher=Office of Public Sector Information |accessdate=8 May 2007}}</ref> In May 2010, the [[Cameron–Clegg coalition|new UK Government]] stated in its [[Conservative – Liberal Democrat coalition agreement|coalition agreement]] that the [[2015 United Kingdom general election|next United Kingdom general election]] would also be held in May 2015.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/may/12/fixed-five-year-parliamentary-term|title=Fixed five-year parliamentary term will tie both leaders' hands|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=13 May 2010|accessdate=7 May 2011|first=Alan|last=Travis}}</ref> This proposal was criticised by the Scottish National Party and Labour, as it had been recommended after the [[2007 Scottish Parliament election|2007 election]] that elections with different voting systems should be held on separate days: a recommendation which all of the political parties had then accepted.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.snp.org/node/17079|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100711071635/http://www.snp.org/node/17079|url-status=dead|archive-date=11 July 2010|publisher=[[Scottish National Party]]|date=31 May 2010|accessdate=7 May 2011|title=Coalition asked to respect Scottish elections}}</ref> In response to this criticism, Deputy Prime Minister [[Nick Clegg]] offered the right to vary the date of the Scottish Parliament election by a year either way.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-12497498|title=UK government offers Holyrood five-year terms|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=17 February 2011|accessdate=7 May 2011}}</ref> All the main political parties then stated their support for delaying the election by a year.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-12507734|title=Salmond back Scotland 2015 election delay|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=18 February 2011|accessdate=7 May 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/news/Holyrood-set-for-a-fiveyear.6720783.jp|title=Holyrood set for a five-year term to avoid clash with general election|work=[[The Scotsman]]|date=19 February 2011|accessdate=7 May 2011|first=Scott|last=McNab|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110222062419/http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/news/Holyrood-set-for-a-fiveyear.6720783.jp|archive-date=22 February 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> The [[Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011]], a statute of the UK Parliament, moved the date of the Scottish Parliament election to 5 May 2016.<ref name=fixed/>

The date of the poll may be varied by up to one month either way by the [[British monarchy|monarch]], on the proposal of the [[Presiding Officer of the Scottish Parliament|Presiding Officer]].<ref name="ScotlandAct1"/>

If Parliament itself resolves that it should be dissolved, with at least two-thirds of the [[Members of the Scottish Parliament|Members]] (i.e. 86 Members) voting in favour, the Presiding Officer proposes a date for an extraordinary election and the Parliament is dissolved by the monarch by [[royal proclamation]].

It does not necessarily require a two-thirds majority to precipitate an extraordinary election, because under the Scotland Act Parliament is also dissolved if it fails to nominate one of its members to be [[First Minister of Scotland|First Minister]] within certain time limits, irrespective of whether at the beginning or in the middle of a parliamentary term. Therefore, if the First Minister resigned, Parliament would then have 28 days to elect a successor (s46(2)b and s46(3)a). If no new First Minister was elected then the Presiding Officer would ask for Parliament to be dissolved under s3(1)a. This process could also be triggered if the First Minister lost a [[vote of confidence]] by a [[Majority|simple majority]] (i.e. more than 50%), as s/he must then resign (Scotland Act 1998 s45(2)). To date the Parliament has never held a vote of no confidence in a First Minister.

No extraordinary elections have been held to date. Any extraordinary elections would be in addition to ordinary elections, unless held less than six months before the due date of an ordinary election, in which case they supplant it. The subsequent ordinary election reverts to the first Thursday in May, a multiple of four years after 1999.<ref name="ScotlandAct3">{{cite web |url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/ACTS/acts1998/80046--a.htm#3 |title=Scotland Act 1998 – Section 3 Extraordinary General Elections |publisher=Office of Public Sector Information |accessdate=8 May 2007}}</ref>

It was envisaged that the election would still have taken place as scheduled if Scotland had voted in favour of [[2014 Scottish independence referendum|independence]] in 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2012/01/1006/6|title=Your Scotland – Your Referendum – A Consultation Document|first=Scottish Government, St. Andrew's House, Regent Road, Edinburgh EH1 3DG Tel:0131 556 8400|last=ceu@scotland.gsi.gov.uk|date=25 January 2012}}</ref>

===Deselected MSPs===

Changes to the SNP's selection procedures the previous year in order to ensure gender balance of candidates meant that any incumbent constituency MSP who chose to retire would  have their replacement selected from an all woman shortlist. The only ways for a new male candidate to receive a constituency nomination would be to stand in a constituency currently held by an opposition MSP or to run a de-selection campaign against a sitting MSP. For that reason there were far more challenges than normal within the SNP, but only two were successful:

==Election system, seats, and regions==
{{main|Scottish Parliament constituencies and regions from 2011}}
The total number of [[Members of the Scottish Parliament]] (MSPs) elected to the Parliament is 129.

The First Periodical Review of the [[Scottish Parliament constituencies and regions|Scottish Parliament's constituencies and regions]] by the [[Boundary Commission for Scotland]], was announced on 3 July 2007. The Commission published its provisional proposals for the regional boundaries in 2009.

The Scottish Parliament uses an [[Additional Members System]], designed to produce approximate [[proportional representation]] for each region. There are 8 regions, each sub-divided into smaller constituencies. There are a total of 73 [[Scottish Parliament constituencies and regions|constituencies]]. Each constituency elects one MSP by the [[Plurality voting system|plurality]] ([[first past the post]]) system of election. Each region elects 7 additional MSPs using an [[Mixed member proportional representation|additional member]] system. 
A modified [[D'Hondt method]], using the constituency results, is used to elect these additional MSPs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/2840087.stm |title=Electoral system: How it works, 02 April 2003 |work=[[BBC News Online]] |date=2003-04-02 |accessdate=2011-05-06}}</ref><ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/democracylive/hi/guides/newsid_8227000/8227617.stm D'Hondt system], ''[[BBC News Online]]'', 28 September 2009. Accessed 4 May 2011</ref>

The Scottish Parliament constituencies have not been coterminous with [[Scottish Westminster constituencies]] since the [[2005 United Kingdom general election|2005 general election]], when the 72 former UK Parliament constituencies were replaced with a new set of 59, generally larger, constituencies (see [[Scottish Parliament (Constituencies) Act 2004]]). The boundaries used for the Scottish Parliament elections were then revised for the 2011 election. The Boundary Commission also recommended changes to the electoral regions used to elect "list" members of the Scottish Parliament,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bcomm-scotland.gov.uk/1st_holyrood/rev_rec_regions/regions_revised_recommendations_map_A2.pdf |title=Revised Recommendations |publisher=Boundary Commission for Scotland |accessdate=26 April 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110612043941/http://www.bcomm-scotland.gov.uk/1st_holyrood/rev_rec_regions/regions_revised_recommendations_map_A2.pdf |archive-date=12 June 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> which were also implemented in 2011.
