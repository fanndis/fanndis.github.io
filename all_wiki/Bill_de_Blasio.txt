'''Bill de Blasio''' ({{IPAc-en|d|ɪ|ˈ|b|l|ɑː|z|i|oʊ}}; born '''Warren Wilhelm Jr.''', May 8, 1961) is an American politician serving as the [[List of mayors of New York City|109th]] [[mayor of New York City]] since 2014.

De Blasio was born in a [[Manhattan]] hospital after his parents drove down from their [[Norwalk, Connecticut]] home for his birth,<ref name=":1"/> and was primarily raised in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]]. He graduated from [[New York University]] and [[Columbia University]] before a brief stint as a [[campaign manager]] for [[Charles Rangel]] and [[Hillary Clinton]]. De Blasio started his career as an elected official on the [[New York City Council]], representing the 39th district in [[Brooklyn]] from 2002 to 2009. After serving one term as public advocate, he was elected [[mayor of New York City]] in [[2013 New York City mayoral election|2013]] and reelected in [[2017 New York City mayoral election|2017]].

De Blasio's policy initiatives have included new [[de-escalation]] training for officers, reduced prosecutions for [[Legality of cannabis|cannabis possession]], implementation of police [[Body worn video|body cameras]], and ending the post-[[September 11 attacks|9/11]] surveillance program of Muslim residents. In his first term, he implemented free universal [[Pre-kindergarten|Pre-K]] in the city. De Blasio has called attention to what he calls stark economic inequality in New York City, which he described as a "[[A Tale of Two Cities|tale of two cities]]" during his first campaign. He has supported [[Social liberalism|socially liberal]] and [[Progressive Era|progressive]] policies in regard to [[Economy of New York City|the city's economy]], urban planning, public education, police relations, and [[privatization]].

De Blasio ran in the [[2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries|Democratic primaries]] for the [[2020 United States presidential election|2020 presidential election]]. After registering low poll numbers and failing to qualify for the third round of primary debates, he suspended his campaign on September 20, 2019, and endorsed [[Bernie Sanders]] five months later.

}}In November 2008, de Blasio announced his candidacy for [[New York City Public Advocate]], entering a crowded field of candidates vying for the Democratic nomination that included former Public Advocate [[Mark J. Green]]. ''[[The New York Times]]'' endorsed de Blasio, praising his efforts to improve public schools and "[help] many less-fortunate New Yorkers with food stamps, housing, and children's health" as a councilmember. The paper declared de Blasio the best candidate for the job "because he has shown that he can work well with [[Michael Bloomberg|Mayor Bloomberg]] when it makes sense to do so while vehemently and eloquently opposing him when justified."<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/29/opinion/29sat4.html | title=For New York City Public Advocate | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=August 29, 2009 | accessdate=August 13, 2013}}</ref> His candidacy was endorsed by then Public Advocate [[Betsy Gotbaum]], former [[New York City Mayor|Mayor]] [[Ed Koch]], former [[New York Governor|Governor]] [[Mario Cuomo]], and [[Al Sharpton|Reverend Al Sharpton]].<ref name="nyt-sharpton">{{cite news | url=http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/07/16/snubbing-green-gently-sharpton-backs-de-blasio/ | title=Snubbing Green (Gently), Sharpton Backs de Blasio | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=July 16, 2009 | accessdate=November 6, 2013 | author=David W.

===Tenure===
====Affordable housing====
In June 2010, de Blasio opposed a [[New York City Housing Authority]] decision to cut the number of [[Section 8 (housing)|Section 8]] vouchers issued to low-income New Yorkers. The cut was announced after the NYCHA discovered it could not pay for approximately 2,600 vouchers that had already been issued.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/public-advocate-bill-de-blasio-section-8-housing-subsidies-cuts-cost-city-article-1.183500 | title=Public Advocate Bill de Blasio: Section 8 housing Subsidies Cuts Will Cost City | work=New York Daily News | date=June 20, 2010 | accessdate=August 11, 2015 | author=Einhorn, Erin}}</ref> Two months later, he launched an online "NYC's Worst Landlords Watchlist" to track landlords who failed to repair dangerous living conditions.

De Blasio has criticized ''[[Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission|Citizens United]]'', the January 2010 U.S. [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] decision that overturned parts of the [[Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act|2002 McCain-Feingold Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act]].

====Education====
As public advocate, de Blasio repeatedly criticized Bloomberg's education policies. He called for [[Cathie Black]], Bloomberg's nominee for [[New York City Schools Chancellor]], to take part in public forums and criticized her for sending her own children to private schools.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.nydailynews.com/blogs/dailypolitics/bill-de-blasio-unimpressed-cathie-black-hedging-public-school-do-over-kids-blog-entry-1.1682072 | title=Bill de Blasio Unimpressed With Cathie Black's Hedging On A Public School Do-Over For Her Kids | work=[[New York Daily News]] | date=December 8, 2010 | accessdate=January 11, 2015 | author=Celeste Katz}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20101115/manhattan/public-advocate-wants-cathie-black-hold-open-meeting-with-parents-administrators | title=Public Advocate Wants Cathie Black to Hold Open Meeting With Parents, Administrators | work=DNAinfo New York | date=November 15, 2010 | accessdate=October 16, 2013 | author=Jill Colvin | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021212015/http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20101115/manhattan/public-advocate-wants-cathie-black-hold-open-meeting-with-parents-administrators | archive-date=October 21, 2013 | df=mdy-all }}</ref> In March 2010, he spoke against an [[Metropolitan Transportation Authority|MTA]] proposal to eliminate free MetroCards for students, arguing the measure would take a significant toll on school attendance.<ref>{{cite press release | url=http://pubadvocate.nyc.gov/news/2010-02-18/protests-against-mta-continue-effort-save-student-metrocards | title=Protects Against the MTA Continue in Effort to Save Student MetroCards | publisher=Office of the Public Advocate | date=February 18, 2010 | access-date=May 8, 2012 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017024431/http://pubadvocate.nyc.gov/news/2010-02-18/protests-against-mta-continue-effort-save-student-metrocards | archive-date=October 17, 2013 | url-status=dead }}</ref> Three months later, he voiced opposition to the mayor's proposed budget containing more than $34 million in cuts to childcare services.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://archive.advocate.nyc.gov/daycare | title=Public Advocate de Blasio & NYC Parents Fight to Protect City's Daycare Centers | publisher=Office of the Public Advocate}}</ref> In June 2011, de Blasio outlined a plan to improve the process of school co-location, by which multiple schools are housed in one building.

He outlined eight solutions to improve the process and incorporate community opinion into the decision-making process.<ref>{{cite press release | url=http://archive.advocate.nyc.gov/news/2011-07-20/consensus-reform-plan-collaborative-school-co-locations | title=Consensus for Reform: A Plan for Collaborative School Co-Locations | publisher=Office of the Public Advocate | date=July 20, 2011}}</ref> The same month, he also criticized a Bloomberg administration proposal to lay off more than 4,600 teachers to balance the city's budget; de Blasio organized parents and communities against the proposed cuts and staged a last-minute call-a-thon.

A key focus of de Blasio's mayoral tenure has been to build more affordable housing, with a goal of 200,000 units.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www1.nyc.gov/site/housing/problem/problem.page|title=Problem – NYC Housing Plan|website=www1.nyc.gov|access-date=2017-05-04}}</ref> His plan passed the City Council,<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20161019/EXPERT/161019847/why-mayor-bill-de-blasios-affordable-housing-plan-is-in-trouble-as-opponents-of-rezoning-such-as-council-member-ydanis-rodriguez-and-critics-like-jimmy-van-bremer-mount-opposition|title=Why de Blasio's affordable housing plan is in trouble [in 5 steps]|last=Anuta|first=Joe|work=Crain's New York Business|access-date=2017-05-04}}</ref> but has been controversial.

[[Atlantic Avenue (New York City)|Atlantic Avenue]], in the [[East New York]] neighborhood of [[Brooklyn]], which has been scarred by decades of poverty and crime, was the first test and focus of de Blasio's strategy on affordable housing, one of the policy initiatives central to his platform of reducing inequality. Since 2012, city planners have been working to bring residents to forums to consult on the process. The plan is to "invite developers to build up local streets in exchange for more units of affordable housing." They will invest in new trees, parks, sidewalks, schools, shops, and restaurants that will lead to better services.<ref name="NYT_2015">{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/04/nyregion/an-obstacle-to-mayor-de-blasios-affordable-housing-plan-neighborhood-resistance.html?smid=tw-nytimes | title=Some See Risk in de Blasio's Bid to Add Housing | work=New York Times | date=February 3, 2015 | accessdate=February 8, 2015 | location=New York | pages=A1 | first2=Mireya | last2=Navarro | first1=Vivian | last1=Yee}}</ref>

Opposition to [[Stop-and-frisk in New York City|the NYPD's "stop and frisk" policy]] was a centerpiece of De Blasio's campaign.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://nation.time.com/2014/01/30/stop-and-frisk-bill-de-blasio-michael-bloomberg-appeal-crime |title=New NYC Mayor Drops Stop-and-Frisk Appeal |work=[[Time Magazine]] |date= January 30, 2014 |author=Eliana Dockterman}}</ref> The practice had been challenged by civil rights groups in federal court, where it was [[Floyd v.

De Blasio selected [[Bill Bratton]] for [[New York City Police Commissioner]], a position he had held under Mayor [[Rudy Giuliani]].

In February 2014, de Blasio came under criticism{{By whom|date=June 2020}} for calling the police shortly after one of his supporters was detained by police. Pastor Bishop Orlando Findlayter—the founder of the New Hope Christian Fellowship Church, and a friend of de Blasio—was pulled over for failing to signal on a left turn. Findlayter was then detained by police on outstanding warrants and driving with a suspended license.<ref name=Bishop1>{{cite news|url=https://nytimes.com/2014/02/12/nyregion/mayors-call-did-not-prompt-pastors-release-police-say.html |title=Mayor's Call Did Not Prompt Pastor's Release Police Say |work=[[The New York Times]]|author=Joseph Goldstein|date=February 12, 2014 |accessdate=March 30, 2014}}</ref> De Blasio is alleged to have called the police on Findlayter's behalf.

On December 3, 2014, following a [[Grand juries in the United States|grand jury]] decision not to indict NYPD officer Daniel Pantaleo in the [[death of Eric Garner]], de Blasio said in a speech that he and his [[African American]] wife, [[Chirlane McCray]], had had many conversations<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2014/dec/21/mayor-bill-de-blasio-police-two-nypd-officers-shot-dead|title=De Blasio at Centre of Police Storm After Two NYPD Officers Shot Dead|author=Amanda Holpuch|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=December 21, 2014|accessdate=December 22, 2014}}</ref> with their biracial son about taking "special care in any encounters he has with the police officers who are there to protect him."<ref name=Garner>{{cite news|author=Erin Durkin|title=De Blasio Talks of Worries for Son Dante After Grand Jury Declines to Indict Cop in Eric Garner Death|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/de-blasio-talks-biracial-son-eric-garner-grand-jury-article-1.2032253|newspaper=[[New York Daily News]]|date=December 3, 2014|accessdate=December 15, 2014}}</ref> De Blasio also "offered qualified support for protesters after the grand jury decision not to charge the officer involved in the chokehold death of Eric Garner in New York City".<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-police-idUSKBN0KD06A20150104|title=Hundreds of police turn backs on NYC mayor at slain officer's funeral|last=Malo|first=Sebastien|date=2015-01-04|work=Reuters|access-date=2019-01-02|language=en}}</ref>

Following the murder of New York City police officer Miosotis Familia in July 2017, de Blasio received further criticism for not attending Familia's vigil. Many officers again turned their backs on him when he spoke at a service for Familia.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_S3KauQWqk|title=NYPD officers turn their backs on Mayor de Blasio at slain officer's funeral|first=Fox|last=News|publisher=YouTube|date=12 July 2017|accessdate=14 May 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.politico.com/states/new-york/city-hall/story/2017/07/11/de-blasio-greeted-by-turned-backs-at-familia-funeral-113318|title=Protesters turn their backs on de Blasio at officer's funeral|first=Gloria|last=Pazmino|website=Politico PRO}}</ref>

In November 2019, de Blasio criticized former mayor Michael Bloomberg's apology for the [[stop and frisk]] policy, tweeting, "This is LONG overdue and the timing is transparent and cynical.

Along with Governor Cuomo, de Blasio supported moving [[Amazon (company)|Amazon's]] [[headquarters]] to [[Long Island City]] in the [[Amazon HQ2]] search, and worked with Cuomo to develop a benefits package from New York City and State funds totaling $2.988 billion.<ref name="auto">{{cite web |last1=Raskin |first1=Sam |title=Amazon's HQ2 deal with New York, explained |url=https://ny.curbed.com/2018/11/16/18098589/amazon-hq2-nyc-queens-long-island-city-explained |website=Curbed New York |accessdate=23 May 2019}}</ref> In November 2018, Long Island City was selected as one of two sites for HQ2, along with [[Crystal City, Arlington, Virginia|Crystal City]] in Virginia, directly outside of [[Washington, D.C.|Washington, D.C]].<ref name="auto"/> Long Island City's selection as a site for Amazon's HQ2 was controversial before and after it happened, and was protested by local residents, community organizations, and politicians.

====Transportation====
In 2014, de Blasio released a report dedicated to "better transit for New York City." Some of the ideas brought up in the report were to rebuild [[Pennsylvania Station (New York City)|Penn Station]]/[[Madison Square Garden]], create more [[bus rapid transit]] routes,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dnwssx4l7gl7s.cloudfront.net/deblasio/default/page/-/One%20New%20York%2C%20Rising%20Together%20-%20Transit.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150524211041/http://dnwssx4l7gl7s.cloudfront.net/deblasio/default/page/-/One%20New%20York%2C%20Rising%20Together%20-%20Transit.pdf|url-status=dead|title=Better Transit for New York City|archive-date=May 24, 2015}}</ref> and a "Vision Zero" initiative to reduce traffic-related deaths in the city.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/19/nyregion/de-blasio-unveils-plans-to-eliminate-traffic-deaths.html|title=De Blasio Outlines Steps to Eliminate Traffic Deaths|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|author=Matt Flegenheimer|date=February 18, 2014|accessdate=May 20, 2014}}</ref>

While the de Blasio administration planned on increasing the rate at which bicycle racks were added in the city, the annual rate has instead fallen by 42 percent compared to the Bloomberg administration, reaching a new average of 1,633 new racks per year.{{When|date=October 2019}} Jon Orcutt, a spokesman for Bike New York, said "Everybody's talking about [[Citi Bike]]s and scooters but it's the humble bike rack that needs more attention."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amny.com/transit/bike-racks-nyc-1.27886025|title=Competition is fierce as bike rack installations slow|website=am New York}}</ref>

Despite his large margins of victory during his mayoral races, polls found de Blasio to be largely unpopular.

De Blasio attempted to position himself as a progressive in contrast to the at-the-time front-runner, former [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Joe Biden]].
