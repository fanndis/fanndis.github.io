{{Politics of the Philippines}}

The '''government of the Philippines''' ({{lang-fil|Pamahalaan ng Pilipinas}}) is the [[Central government|national government]] of the [[Philippines]]. It is governed as a [[unitary state]] under a [[presidential system|presidential]] [[representative democracy|representative and democratic]] and a [[Constitution of the Philippines|constitutional]] [[republic]] where the [[President of the Philippines|President]] functions as both the [[head of state]] and the [[head of government]] of the country within a [[Diversity (politics)|pluriform]] [[multi-party system]].

The government has three interdependent branches: the legislative branch, the executive branch, and the judicial branch. The powers of the branches are vested by the [[Constitution of the Philippines]] in the following: [[Legislature|Legislative power]] is vested in the two-chamber [[Congress of the Philippines]]—the [[Senate of the Philippines|Senate]] is the upper chamber and the [[House of Representatives of the Philippines|House of Representatives]] is the lower chamber.<ref>{{cite executive order

[[Executive (government)|Executive power]] is exercised by the [[government]] under the leadership of the President. [[Judiciary|Judicial power]] is vested in the courts with the [[Supreme Court of the Philippines]] as the highest judicial body.

==Legislative power==
The legislative power is vested in the Congress of the Philippines which consists of the Senate of the Philippines and the [[House of Representatives of the Philippines|House of Representatives]]. The upper house is located in Pasay City, while the lower house is located in Quezon City. Both are in Metro Manila. The district and sectoral representatives are elected for a term of three years. They can be re-elected but they may not run for a fourth consecutive term.

Senators are elected to a term of six years. They can be re-elected but may not run for a third consecutive term. The House of Representatives may opt to pass for a vacancy of a legislative seat, which leads to a special election. The winner of the special election will serve the unfinished term of the previous district representative, and will be considered as one elective term. The same rule also applies in the Senate, however it only applies if the seat was vacated before a regular legislative election.

The current [[President of the Senate of the Philippines|President of the Senate]] is Vicente Sotto, III, while the current [[Speaker of the House of Representatives of the Philippines|Speaker of the House of Representatives]] is Lord Allan Velasco.

If there is a vacancy in the position of vice-president, the President will appoint any member of Congress (usually a party member) as the new Vice President. The appointment must then be validated by a three-fourths vote of the Congress.<ref>[https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/about/gov/ Philippine Government]</ref>
