'''Jacqueline Jill Smith''' (born 3 November 1962) is a British broadcaster, political commentator and former [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] politician. She was the [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] for [[Redditch (UK Parliament constituency)|Redditch]] from [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997]] until [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010]], the first female [[Home Secretary]] and the third woman to hold one of the [[Great Offices of State]], after [[Margaret Thatcher]] ([[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]]) and [[Margaret Beckett]] ([[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]]).

She resigned as Home Secretary on 5 June 2009 following her involvement in the [[United Kingdom parliamentary expenses scandal]] in which she had falsely claimed that a room in her sister's house was her main home. Smith, the most high-profile figure involved in the scandal, then lost her seat as Member of Parliament for Redditch in the [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010 general election]]. After leaving the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]], she remained in public life as a political pundit and took up roles in various other sectors, such as health and media.

==Early life==
Jacqui Smith was born in [[Malvern, Worcestershire]]. She attended [[Dyson Perrins CE Sports College|Dyson Perrins High School]] in Malvern. Her parents were teachers, and both [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] councillors, although her mother briefly joined the [[Social Democratic Party (UK)|SDP]]. Her local MP, [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] backbencher [[Michael Spicer]], recalled in Parliament in 2003 how he had first met her when he addressed the [[sixth form]] at [[The Chase (school)|The Chase School]], where her mother was a teacher;<ref>[http://archive.thisisworcestershire.co.uk/2001/6/8/322752.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090608040534/http://archive.thisisworcestershire.co.uk/2001/6/8/322752.html |date=8 June 2009}}</ref> he joked: "So great was my eloquence that she immediately rushed off and joined the Labour Party."<ref>[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmhansrd/vo030401/debtext/30401-25.htm House of Commons Hansard] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170919234229/https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmhansrd/vo030401/debtext/30401-25.htm |date=19 September 2017}}, 1 April 2003, column 876: Michael Spicer on Jacqui Smith.</ref> Smith read [[Philosophy, Politics and Economics|PPE]] at [[Hertford College, Oxford]], and gained a [[Postgraduate Certificate in Education|PGCE]] from [[Worcester College of Higher Education]].{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

Working as a school teacher, Smith taught Economics at [[Arrow Vale High School]] in Redditch from 1986 to 1988<ref>[http://www.uktransplant.org.uk/ukt/newsroom/bulletin/archive_bulletins/bulletins38-41_2001/bulletin40.pdf New Minister of State for Health] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120216083755/http://www.uktransplant.org.uk/ukt/newsroom/bulletin/archive_bulletins/bulletins38-41_2001/bulletin40.pdf |date=16 February 2012 }}, UK Transplant Bulletin, Autumn 2001.</ref> and at [[Worcester Sixth Form College]], before becoming Head of Economics and [[GNVQ]] Co-ordinator at [[Haybridge High School]], [[Hagley]], in 1990.

==Political career==

===Member of Parliament===
Having failed to be elected as a Labour MP for the safe Conservative seat of [[Mid Worcestershire (UK Parliament constituency)|Mid Worcestershire]] in [[1992 United Kingdom general election|1992]], despite achieving a 4.9% swing, Smith was selected through an [[all-women shortlist]] in the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997 general election]] as the Labour candidate for [[Redditch (UK Parliament constituency)|Redditch]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.parliament.uk/commons/lib/research/briefings/snpc-05057.pdf |archive-url=https://www.webarchive.org.uk/wayback/archive/20090730031914/http://www.parliament.uk/commons/lib/research/briefings/snpc-05057.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=30 July 2009 |title=All women shortlists |publisher=House of commons library |access-date=4 August 2009}}</ref>

She won the seat as part of a (then) record number of female MPs elected to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] who were dubbed "[[Blair Babe]]s". Smith was re-elected in [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001]] and [[2005 United Kingdom general election|2005]]; following the 2005 election she had a majority of just 2,716 (6.7% of the vote), owing to boundary changes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ukpollingreport.co.uk/guide/seat-profiles/Redditch |title=UKPollingReport Election Guide 2010 » Redditch |website=Ukpollingreport.co.uk |access-date=2016-01-10 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160128064327/http://ukpollingreport.co.uk/guide/seat-profiles/Redditch/ |archive-date=28 January 2016 |df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article6871725.ece |work=The Times |location=London |title=Jacqui Smiths career facing ruin after devastating expenses verdict |date=13 October 2009 |access-date=5 May 2010 |first1=Sam |last1=Coates |first2=Russell |last2=Jenkins |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100529135111/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article6871725.ece |archive-date=29 May 2010 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>

Smith entered the Government in July 1999, as a [[Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State]] at the [[Department for Education and Employment]], working with the Minister for School Standards [[Estelle Morris]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Education ministers change in reshuffle |date=29 July 1999 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/406923.stm |work=BBC News |access-date=15 May 2008 |location=London}}</ref> She then became a [[Minister of State]] at the [[Department of Health (United Kingdom)|Department of Health]] following the [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001 general election]]. She was appointed as the Government's deputy [[Minister for Women (United Kingdom)|Minister for Women]] in 2003, working alongside [[Secretary of State]] [[Patricia Hewitt]]. In this role she published the Government's proposals for [[Civil partnership in the United Kingdom|Civil Partnerships]], a system designed to offer same-sex couples an opportunity to gain legal recognition for their relationship with an associated set of rights and responsibilities.

===Minister for Schools===
Following the [[2005 United Kingdom general election|2005 general election]], Smith was appointed to serve as the [[Minister of State]] for [[School]]s in the [[Department for Education and Skills (United Kingdom)|Department for Education and Skills]], replacing [[Stephen Twigg]] who had lost his seat.<ref>{{cite news |title=Adviser Adonis made a minister |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/4530433.stm |work=BBC News |access-date=15 May 2008 |date=10 May 2005 |location=London |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060219041454/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/4530433.stm |archive-date=19 February 2006 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> Teacher [[trade union]] sources stated that Smith "talked to us on our level".<ref name='Tears'/>

===Government Chief Whip===
In the 2006 [[Cabinet shuffle|reshuffle]] she was appointed as the Government's [[Chief Whip]]. In a period when supporters of [[Gordon Brown]] were pushing [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Tony Blair]] to resign, she was successfully able to calm the situation down.<ref name='Tears'/> The [[BBC]]'s political editor [[Nick Robinson (journalist)|Nick Robinson]] described her as being effective at "making peace between the warring Blair and Brown factions".<ref>{{cite news |title=Profile: Jacqui Smith |date=19 July 2007 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/6906150.stm |work=BBC News |access-date=15 May 2008 |location=London |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070903221645/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/6906150.stm |archive-date=3 September 2007 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>

Smith was regarded as a loyal [[Blairism|Blairite]] during [[Premiership of Tony Blair|Tony Blair's premiership]], a position reflected in her voting record,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.publicwhip.org.uk/mp.php?mpn=Jacqui_Smith&mpc=Redditch |title=Voting Record — Jacqui Smith MP, Redditch (10549) — The Public Whip |website=Publicwhip.org.uk |access-date=2016-01-10 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303203236/http://www.publicwhip.org.uk/mp.php?mpn=Jacqui_Smith&mpc=Redditch |archive-date=3 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> and she was brought to tears by Blair's farewell appearance in the House of Commons.<ref name='Tears'>{{cite news| title=First woman at the Home Office: Jacqui Smith| date=29 June 2007| url=http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/politics/article2720095.ece| work=[[The Independent]]| access-date=22 January 2008| location=London| first1=Nigel| last1=Morris| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071223193040/http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/politics/article2720095.ece| archive-date=23 December 2007| df=dmy-all}}</ref>

===Home Secretary===
Smith was appointed [[Home Secretary]] in [[Gordon Brown]]'s [[Brown ministry|first Cabinet reshuffle]] of 28 June 2007. Just one day into her new job [[2007 London car bombs|bombs were found]] in London and a [[Glasgow Airport attack|terrorist attack]] took place in [[Glasgow]] the following day.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Townsend|first1=Mark|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/jul/01/terrorism.world2|title=Terror threat 'critical' as Glasgow attacked|date=2007-07-01|work=The Observer|access-date=2020-03-08|last2=Revill|first2=Jo|language=en-GB|issn=0029-7712|last3=Kelbie|first3=Paul}}</ref>

On 24 January 2008, she announced new powers for the police, including the proposal to permit law enforcement services to hold terrorist suspects or those linked to terrorism for up to [[Counter-Terrorism Bill 2008|42 days]] without charging them.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7130072.stm|title=smith plans 42-day terror limit|publisher=bbc online|access-date=4 August 2009|date=6 December 2007|location=London|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090407082856/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7130072.stm|archive-date=7 April 2009|df=dmy-all}}</ref> In the same month Smith said that she would not feel safe on the streets of London at night.

When Conservative MP [[Damian Green]] was arrested in his Commons office, Smith stated that she was not informed of the impending arrest. The Metropolitan Police said that Green was "arrested on suspicion of conspiring to commit misconduct in a public office and aiding and abetting, counselling or procuring misconduct in a public office". A junior Home Office official, Christopher Galley, was later arrested regarding the same alleged offences as Green, and was released on bail. He was not charged, but he was suspended from his Home Office job while the investigation continued. He was later dismissed from his position for gross misconduct. Green did not dispute having dealings with the Home Office official.<ref name="Grieve criticism">Philippe Naughton [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article5286281.ece "MPs' fresh fury as Jacqui Smith defends Home Office over leaks"], ''The Times'', 4 December 2008</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/apr/24/damian-green-civil-servant-sacked|title=damian-green-civil-servant-sacked|access-date=2 June 2009|publisher=guardian online|date=24 April 2009|location=London|first=Deborah|last=Summers|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140914073541/http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/apr/24/damian-green-civil-servant-sacked|archive-date=14 September 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

In March 2009, at the height of the expenses furore, a leaked poll of Labour Party members revealed that Smith was considered to be the worst performing member of the cabinet, with only 56% of her party believing she was doing a good job.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ukpollingreport.co.uk/blog/archives/1968 |title=UK Polling Report |publisher=UK Polling Report |date=2009-03-07 |access-date=2016-01-10 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150912112047/http://ukpollingreport.co.uk/blog/archives/1968 |archive-date=12 September 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/labour/4953559/Harriet-Harman-less-popular-than-Peter-Mandelson-among-Labour-members.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Patrick | last=Hennessy | title=Harriet Harman less popular than Peter Mandelson among Labour members | date=7 March 2009 | url-status=live | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090312042736/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/labour/4953559/Harriet-Harman-less-popular-than-Peter-Mandelson-among-Labour-members.html | archive-date=12 March 2009 | df=dmy-all }}</ref>

In October 2018 Chief Prosecutor in [[North West England]], [[Nazir Afzal]], alleged on [[BBC Radio 4]] that the Home Office had issued a memo to all police forces in 2008, informing that the child victims of Pakistani [[Child grooming#Localised grooming|grooming gangs]] had made an "informed choice" and "it's not for you police officers to get involved in". Smith ran the Home Office at the time of this alleged instruction.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNmyMc26YUc Nazir Afzal - Radio 4 (19th Oct 2018) - YouTube<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

==== National identity legislation ====
{{main|Identity Cards Act 2006}}
In May 2009, Smith announced that the cost of introducing the National Identity Card project (a scheme abandoned by the incoming Liberal-Conservative coalition government in May 2010), had risen to an estimated [[pound sterling|£]]5.3 billion, and that it would first become compulsory for foreign students and airport staff. It was planned that the cards would be made available from high-street shops at an estimated cost of [[£]]60.<ref name="Smith ID comments 'beggar belief'">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7714998.stm "Smith ID comments 'beggar belief'"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090203221305/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7714998.stm |date=3 February 2009 }}, ''BBC News'', 7 November 2008.

==== Drug policy ====
On 19 July 2007, Smith admitted to smoking [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] a few times in Oxford in the 1980s. "I did break the law... I was wrong... drugs are wrong", she said.

In February 2009, Smith was accused by Nutt of making a political decision in rejecting the scientific advice to downgrade ecstasy from a class A drug. The advisory council on the misuse of drugs (ACMD) report on ecstasy, based on a 12-month study of 4,000 academic papers, concluded that it is nowhere near as dangerous as other class A drugs such as heroin and crack cocaine, and should be downgraded to class B alongside amphetamines and cannabis.

On 8 February 2009, it was reported in the media that Smith had designated a house in London owned by her sister as her main residence in order to claim a parliamentary allowance for her house in [[Redditch]] as a secondary home, despite explicitly stating on her website that she "lives in Redditch".<ref>[http://www.jacquismithmp.labour.co.uk/biography ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080917164426/http://www.jacquismithmp.labour.co.uk/biography |date=17 September 2008}}</ref> When asked whether it was fair that she made claims believed to have been made for items such as a flat-screen TV and scatter cushions, she said that analyses of her receipts had been very particular.

It was also reported that Smith had claimed expenses for a telecoms bill that contained two [[pornographic film]]s and two other [[pay-per-view]] films. Smith said it was a mistake, and she would repay the amount. The reports made clear that the films had been viewed in the family home at a time when Smith was not present, and that she had given her husband, Richard Timney, a "real ear-bashing" over the incident.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7970492.stm |title=Smith 'sorry' for expenses claim |access-date=29 March 2009 |work=BBC News |date=29 March 2009 |location=London |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090401140349/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7970492.stm |archive-date=1 April 2009 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> This and other cases prompted calls for reform of the additional costs allowance and a new system of payments to be introduced.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7973075.stm|title=Scrap second home allowance – PM|publisher=BBC News|date=30 March 2009|access-date=30 March 2009|location=London|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090331214215/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7973075.stm|archive-date=31 March 2009|df=dmy-all}}</ref>  [[Gordon Brown]] supported her and said she had done nothing wrong.<ref>{{cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7971221.stm|title= Brown backs Smith in expenses row|date= 30 March 2009|access-date= 5 June 2009|work= BBC News|location= London|url-status= live|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090404130821/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7971221.stm|archive-date= 4 April 2009|df= dmy-all}}</ref> However, [[Alistair Graham|Sir Alistair Graham]], the former Chairman of the [[Committee on Standards in Public Life]] was critical of her actions stating that naming her sister's spare bedroom as her main home was "near fraudulent".<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/may/10/mps-expenses-jacqui-smith Taxmen to probe MPs over profits from home sales | Politics | The Guardian<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Smith was the most high-profile politician caught out in the expenses scandal<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/mps-expenses/9617963/MPs-expenses-scandal-Independent-regulator-blocks-expenses-publication.html MPs' expenses scandal: Independent regulator blocks expenses publication - Telegraph<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> and citing the impact on her family life she later resigned.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Women of Westminster : the MPs who changed politics|last=Reeves, Rachel, 1979-|isbn=978-1-78831-677-4|location=London|oclc=1084655208|date = 7 March 2019}}</ref>

In October 2009, it was reported that the Standards Commissioner, [[John Lyon (commissioner)|John Lyon]], had looked into complaints over her expense claims. He concluded that, although her London home was a genuine home and she had spent more nights there than in her Redditch home, her constituency home was in fact her main home, and that she was in breach of Commons rules, despite "significant mitigating circumstances". The claims for pay-per-view films were also found to be in breach. Ms Smith was not asked to repay any money, but was told to "apologise to the House by means of a personal statement." Smith reacted by saying that she was "disappointed that this process has not led to a fairer set of conclusions, based on objective and consistent application of the rules as they were at the time.".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/smith-ordered-to-apologise-over-expenses-1801530.html|title=Smith ordered to apologise|publisher=The Independent|access-date=12 October 2009|location=London|first1=Andrew|last1=Woodcock|date=12 October 2009|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091013163953/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/smith-ordered-to-apologise-over-expenses-1801530.html|archive-date=13 October 2009|df=dmy-all}}</ref>
