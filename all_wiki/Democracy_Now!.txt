=== Studios ===
''Democracy Now!'' began as a radio program broadcast from the studios of WBAI, a local Pacifica Radio station in [[New York City]]. In early September 2001, amid a months-long debate over the mission and management of Pacifica, ''Democracy Now!'' was forced out of the WBAI studios. Goodman took the program to the [[Downtown Community Television Center]] located in a converted firehouse building in New York City's [[Chinatown, Manhattan|Chinatown]], where the program began to be televised.<ref name="Common Dreams">{{cite web |last1=Ratner |first1=Lizzy |title=Amy Goodman's 'Empire' How a prospective biochemist became a muckraker and champion of media reform |url=http://www.commondreams.org/views05/0506-22.htm |website=commondreams.org |accessdate=July 23, 2014 |date=May 6, 2005}}</ref><ref name="Amy Goodman and Juan Gonzalez">{{cite web |title=Farewell to the Firehouse: After 8 Years at Downtown Community Television Landmark, Democracy Now!

On that day Goodman and colleagues continued reporting beyond their scheduled hour-long time slot in what became an eight-hour marathon broadcast. Following [[9/11]], in addition to radio and television, ''Democracy Now!'' expanded their multimedia reach to include [[cable television|cable]], [[satellite radio]], [[Internet]], and [[podcasts]].<ref name="Common Dreams" />

As she yelled "Press!" she was knocked down and told to put her face in the ground while another officer dragged her backward by her leg across the pavement. The video footage of the incident was immediately posted on the Internet, leading to a large public outcry against her arrest. When a second producer, Kouddous, approached, he too was arrested, and charged with a [[felony]]. According to a press release by ''Democracy Now!'', Goodman herself was arrested after confronting officers regarding the arrest of her colleagues. The officers had established a line of "crowd control," and ordered Goodman to move back. Goodman claims she was arrested after being pulled through the police line by an officer, and subsequently (as well as Kouddous) had her press credentials for the convention physically stripped from her by a [[secret service]] agent.<ref name="Q&A" /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/44/2008/09/democracy-now-host-and-produce.html |title=Democracy Now!
