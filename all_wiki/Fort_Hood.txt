'''Fort Hood''' is a [[United States Army]] [[Military installation|post]] located in [[Killeen, Texas]]. Named after [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] General [[John Bell Hood]], it is located halfway between [[Austin, Texas|Austin]] and [[Waco, Texas|Waco]], about {{convert|60|mi}} from each, within the [[U.S. state]] of [[Texas]]. The post is the headquarters of [[III Corps (United States)|III Corps]] and [[First Army Division West]] and is home to the [[1st Cavalry Division (United States)|1st Cavalry Division]] and [[3rd Cavalry Regiment (United States)|3rd Cavalry Regiment]], among others.  It is one of ten U.S. Army bases [[List of U.S. Army installations named for Confederate soldiers|named after former Confederate generals]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Levenson|first=Michael|title=These Are the 10 U.S. Army Installations Named for Confederates|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/11/us/military-bases-confederates.html|access-date=14 June 2020|newspaper=The New York Times|date=11 June 2020}}</ref>

Its origin was the need for wide-open space to test and train with World War II [[Tank destroyer|tank destroyers]]. The [[United States Department of War|War Department]] announced the location in January 1942, and the initial completion was set for that August. As originally constructed, Fort Hood had an area of {{convert|158706|acre}}, with billeting for 6,007 officers and 82,610 enlisted personnel. The main [[cantonment]] of Fort Hood had a total population of 53,416 as of the 2010 U.S. Census. Fort Hood is the most populous [[United States military deployments|U.S. military installation]] in the world.<ref>{{cite news |title=Tested by tragedy, Fort Hood family of civilians and soldiers deserve Texan of the Year honor |author=James Ragland |url=http://www.dallasnews.com/news/columnists/james-ragland/20091206-Tested-by-tragedy-Fort-Hood-2933.ece |newspaper=The Dallas Morning News|date=6 December 2009 |access-date=4 May 2013}}<br/>{{cite news |title=Bangor native to head leadership group  |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=5BA9AAAAIBAJ&dq=fort%20hood%20most%20populous%20world&pg=1099%2C4334436 |newspaper=Bangor Daily News |date=10 April 1985 |access-date=4 May 2013}}</ref> The main business area is in [[Bell County, Texas|Bell County]], with the training countryside area of the post in [[Coryell County, Texas|Coryell County]].

==History==

===Foundation===
During [[World War II]], [[tank destroyer]]s were developed to counter German mobile armored units. These were mobile anti-[[tank]] guns on armored [[Half-track|halftracks]] or specially developed tanks. Wide-open space was needed for the tank destroyer testing and training, which Texas had in abundance. [[Andrew Davis Bruce|Andrew Davis (A.D.) Bruce]] was assigned to organize a new Tank Destroyer Tactical and Firing Center, and he chose Killeen, Texas for the new camp.<ref name="historicalmarker">{{cite web|title=Lt. Gen Andrew Davis Bruce |work=Texas Historical Marker Atlas |publisher=Texas Archival Resources Online |year=2000 |url=http://atlas.thc.state.tx.us/shell-kword.htm |access-date=25 June 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714113229/http://atlas.thc.state.tx.us/shell-kword.htm |archive-date=14 July 2014}}</ref> The War Department announced the selection on 15 January 1942. An initial acquisition of {{Convert|180000|acre|km2|abbr=on}} was made, and it was estimated that the camp would cost $22.8 million for the land, facilities, and development of utilities. The date of completion was set for 15 August 1942.

About 300 families had to move from their homes to make room for the camp area and the communities of [[Clear Creek, Texas|Clear Creek]], [[Elijah, Texas|Elijah]], and [[Antelope, Texas (Bell County)|Antelope]] were demolished to facilitate construction of the base. The old Sugar Loaf community, historically called the "Cradle of Killeen," provided the city with many of its first citizens in 1882. All that remains of the community is the mountain from which it took its name, located in the Fort Hood area. To lessen the burden of moving, the Army agreed to allow land to be used for grazing for a nominal grazing fee. This grazing arrangement still continues today.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

In mid-August, the camp was occupied and the official opening took place on 18 September 1942. Camp Hood was named in February for the Confederate General [[John Bell Hood]], who commanded Hood's [[Texas Brigade]] during the [[American Civil War]],{{Sfn|Willbanks|2001|p=186}} part of a series of new training camps named for distinguished military leaders together with [[Camp Carson|Camps Carson]], [[Camp Campbell|Campbell]] and [[Camp Atterbury|Atterbury]].<ref>{{Cite news|date=22 February 1942|title=Army Names New Camps; Outstanding Soldiers Honored|page=3|work=Chicago Tribune|agency=AP|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/53443189/army-names-new-camps/|via=[[Newspapers.com]]}}</ref> 

The original facilities provided housing and training sites for nearly 38,000 troops. In January 1943, an additional {{Convert|16000|acre|km2}} in Bell County and {{Convert|34943|acre|km2}} in [[Coryell County]] near [[Gatesville, Texas]] were purchased. The site near Gatesville was known as the sub-camp and later as [[North Camp Hood]]. During the war years, North Camp Hood housed nearly 40,000 troops and 4,000 prisoners of war, and was the site for the southern branch of the [[United States Disciplinary Barracks]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

At the end of 1942, there were about 45,000 troops living and training at Camp Hood and in late June 1943 it peaked at almost 95,000 troops,{{Sfn|Willbanks|2001|p=186}} which was maintained until early 1944.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

In 1944, the number of tank destroyer battalions in training at Camp Hood declined rapidly. [[Field artillery]] battalions and the Infantry Replacement Training Center replaced them in March 1944. By September, the Infantry Center was the largest activity on post with 31,545 troops. The total camp population on the last day of 1944 was 50,228.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

During the last year of World War II Camp Hood's mission shifted and its population drastically decreased. As the war came to an end, troop training slowed and equipment reclamation and demobilization were prioritized.{{Sfn|Willbanks|2001|p=186}} A separation center was established in September 1945, and as the year ended, post strength had fallen to 1,807 prisoners and about 11,000 troops.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} The Infantry Replacement Training Center was officially shut down on 7 January 1946.

===Cold War===
The [[2nd Armored Division (United States)|2nd]] and [[20th Armored Division (United States)|20th Armored Divisions]] were sent to Camp Hood after returning from Europe in January 1946, but the 20th was soon inactivated, leaving less than 5,000 at the post. The 2nd Armored would remain at the post until its inactivation at the end of the Cold War.{{Sfn|Willbanks|2001|p=186}} Camp Hood was retained postwar as an armored training center and on 15 April 1950 was officially renamed Fort Hood as a result of its permanent status.<ref>{{Cite news|date=7 May 1950|title='Fort Hood' Now Name of Army Camp|page=13|work=Fort Worth Star-Telegram|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/53444879/fort-hood-renamed-from-camp-hood/|via=Newspapers.com}}</ref> 

In mid-1954, [[III Corps (United States)|III Corps]] moved from [[California]] to Fort Hood. The Corps supervised the training of combat units at Fort Hood and other Fourth Army stations from 1954 to 1959 when III Corps was inactivated. Probably the most famous trainee to come through Fort Hood was [[Elvis Presley]], arriving on 28 March 1958. Other than receiving record amounts of mail (3–4 bags per day), he was treated like all other trainees. On 19 September, Presley shipped out for Germany.
During this period, the [[4th Armored Division (United States)|4th Armored Division]] was reactivated and deployed to Germany as part of the "[[Operation Gyroscope|Gyroscope]]" concept of unit movement.

In September 1961, Fort Hood again became the home for the III Corps, and in February 1962, III Corps was assigned as part of the U.S. Army [[Strategic Army Corps]] (STRAC). At the same time, the basing of the [[1st Armored Division (United States)|1st Armored Division]] there made it a two-division post.{{Sfn|Willbanks|2001|p=186}} On 15 June 1963 [[West Fort Hood|Killeen Base]] was turned over to the Army.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

===Vietnam War ===
During the late 1960s, Fort Hood trained and deployed a number of units and individuals for duty in [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]]. As the United States ended its role in the conflict, thousands of returning soldiers completed their active duty with one of the divisions. During this time, the post was modernized. On 13 September 1965, Darnall Hospital opened. In 1970, construction began on Palmer Theater and Venable Village was dedicated. Modern barracks were springing up around post. The wood buildings of Fort Hood were replaced with brick structures.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

In April 1968, more than forty [[Fort Hood 43|African American GIs]], who objected to being sent to occupy [[1968 Chicago riots|riot-damaged Black neighborhoods in Chicago]] following the assassination of [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], were court martialed and jailed by the US Army. Many of the soldiers were decorated and wounded veterans who had completed tours of duty in Vietnam.<ref>{{cite web|first=Catalinotto|last=John|title=50 years ago Black GIs at Fort Hood jailed for protesting riot-control duty|website=International Action Center|date=20 August 2018|url=https://iacenter.org/2018/08/21/50-years-ago-black-gis-at-fort-hood-jailed-for-protesting-riot-control-duty/}}</ref>

In October 1969, Killeen Base was designated as [[West Fort Hood]] and the airfield's name was designated as Robert Gray Army Airfield. The base was named after a Killeen native who was a pilot of a B-25 bomber on the famous [[Doolittle Raid]] in Tokyo in 1942. He was killed later in World War II flying combat missions. With the redesignation came a change in mission at West Fort Hood. Nuclear weapons were removed; they had been secretly kept there since 1947.<ref>Fort Hood: The Great Place to Call Home, Fort Hood's Official Post Guide, Fort Hood History, page 72. Marcoa Publishing Inc., 2004, under contract with Fort Hood. Editorial content edited and prepared by the Public Affairs Office of Fort Hood.</ref>

In 1971, the colors of the [[1st Cavalry Division (United States)|1st Cavalry Division]] came to Fort Hood from Vietnam, resulting in the reflagging of the [[1st Armored Division (United States)|1st Armored Division]], the colors of which were sent to Germany to reflag the 4th Armored Division.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

From 23 December 1972, to 19 January 1973, elements of the 13th Support Brigade deployed to the [[1972 Nicaragua earthquake]] to assist in disaster relief serving at Camp Christine, Managua, Nicaragua.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

===Proving grounds===
Since the early 1970s, Fort Hood has played a major role in the training, testing, and introduction of new equipment, tactics, and organizations. The U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command's Test and Experimentation Command (now the U.S. Army Operational Test Command), located at West Fort Hood has been a primary player. Fort Hood fielded the [[M1 Abrams]] tank, [[Bradley Fighting Vehicle|M2/3 Bradley Infantry/Cavalry Fighting Vehicle]], the Multiple Launch rocket System (MLRS), and the AH-64 Apache helicopter.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

In January 1975, the 1st Cavalry Division was reorganized, as the Army's newest armored division. Since fielding the M-1 Abrams in 1980, force modernization has continued as a major focus. The 1st Cavalry became the first division to field the AH-64 Apache attack helicopter, M2 Bradley Fighting Vehicle, the [[Humvee]], the [[M270 Multiple Launch Rocket System|Multiple Launch Rocket System]] and [[Mobile Subscriber Equipment]] (MSE) tactical communications.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

===1990–2000 Army deployments===
In August 1990, Fort Hood was alerted for deployments to Southwest Asia as part of the joint forces participating in [[Gulf War|Operation Desert Shield]]. The deployment to [[Saudi Arabia]] began in September, extending into mid-October.

On 21 May 1991, with the reactivation of its 3rd Brigade ("Greywolf") the 1st Cavalry Division became the largest division in the Army upon its return to the United States. In October 1992, the Engineer Brigade, 1st Cavalry Division was reactivated. Through the Engineer Restructuring Initiative, the nucleus of the brigade was formed around the [[8th Engineer Battalion (United States)|8th Engineer Battalion]]. The [[20th Engineer Battalion]] was brought from Fort Campbell, KY, to join the brigade, and the [[91st Engineer Battalion (United States)|91st Engineer Battalion]] was activated to complete the brigade.

In November 1992, the unit designations for the battalions remaining from the former "Tiger" Brigade of the 2nd Armored Division were returned prior to the activation of the division at Fort Hood on 2 December 1992. This action was done to realign the historical designations of units to their parent divisions. On 29 November 1992, the 3rd Battalion, 41st Infantry was designated as the 1st Battalion, 9th Cavalry; 1st Battalion, 67th Armor to 3rd Battalion, [[8th Cavalry Regiment|8th Cavalry]], and 1st Battalion, [[3rd Field Artillery Regiment (United States)|3rd Field Artillery]] to 2nd Battalion, [[82nd Field Artillery Regiment|82nd Field Artillery]]. On 16 December 1992, 1st Cavalry Division units designated to accomplish realignments for historical purposes and included the 1st Battalion, 32nd Armor reflagged as 2nd Battalion, 12th Cavalry; 3rd Battalion, 32nd Armor to 1st Battalion, 12th Cavalry; and Battery A, [[333rd Field Artillery Regiment|333rd Field Artillery]] to Battery B, [[26th Field Artillery Regiment (United States)|26th Field Artillery]].

During the post war periods called [[Operation Desert Farewell|Operation Desert Calm]] and [[Operation Provide Comfort]], Fort Hood units continued to serve in the [[Persian Gulf]] area. From December 1992 to May 1993, Fort Hood soldiers deployed to [[Somalia]] for [[Unified Task Force|Operation Restore Hope]] to command and control the Joint Task Force Support Command. In the fall of 1994, Fort Hood units participated in the largest deployment since Operation Desert Shield and Desert Storm executed split base operations in the Caribbean Basin, Central America and Southwest Asia, in support of Operations Vigilant Warrior and Sea Signal V, as well as other contingency operations.

13th Corps Support Command Commander Brig. Gen. Billy K. Solomon deployed along with a portion of the headquarters in December 1992 to [[Mogadishu]] to serve as the nucleus of [[Joint Task Force Support Command]]. Their major units included the 593rd Support Group ([[Fort Lewis]]), 36th Engineer Group ([[Fort Benning]]), [[7th Transportation Brigade (United States)|7th Transportation Group]] ([[Fort Eustis]]), and 62d Medical Group (Fort Lewis). The command headquarters returned to Fort Hood in May 1993.

As a result of the [[Base Realignment and Closure]] Commission (BRAC) reductions, the [[5th Infantry Division (United States)|5th Infantry Division (Mechanized)]], then located at [[Fort Polk]] Louisiana, was reflagged as the [[2nd Armored Division (United States)|2nd Armored Division]] in late 1992. By mid-1993, the division at Fort Hood had completed changes of unit names to those associated with the 5th Division, and began participation in the early stages of the Army's Experimental Force, [[Transformation of the United States Army|Force XXI]].

In 1995, the 2nd Armored Division was reflagged as the [[4th Infantry Division (United States)|U.S. 4th Infantry Division]]. Twenty-five years after making its home in Colorado, the 4th Infantry Division was again restationed to meet the Army's requirements but this move would be quite different from others. It became a split-based organization with six brigades and three separate battalions stationed at Fort Hood and the 3rd Brigade Combat Team remaining at [[Fort Carson]]. By December 1995, the 4th Infantry Division (Mechanized) assumed responsibility as the Army's Experimental Force (Force XXI), and on 15 December 1995, its colors were unfurled for the first time over central Texas and Fort Hood.

Since the 1990s, Fort Hood units have supported [[Implementation Force|Operation Joint Endeavor]] in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. In October 1998, The 1st Cavalry Division was the first United States division to assume authority of the Multinational Division (North) area of operation in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The mission was to conduct operations to enforce the military provisions set forth by the Dayton Peace Accords.

In 1998, the Ironhorse Division was designated to be the Army's first Multi-Component unit. The main objective being to enhance Total Force integration, optimize the unique capabilities of each component, and improve the overall readiness of the Army. The program was developed to leverage the strengths of the Army's three components (active, reserve and National Guard). As such, 515 positions within the division have been designated as reserve component. These positions include individuals, a unit from the [[Wyoming National Guard]] and dual-mission units from the [[Texas Army National Guard]].

In addition to peacekeeping efforts, Fort Hood units routinely participate in national and international disaster relief efforts. Hours after the [[1985 Mexico City earthquake]], III Corps units were ready to move out to provide assistance. Fort Hood units also aided [[Managua]], [[Nicaragua]], after an earthquake ravaged the city.

During the 1990s, Fort Hood continued an extensive building program to modernize the post. This modernization continues today{{when|date=October 2015}}, with emphasis on quality of life, force projection and training. The Robertson Blood Center, Soldier Development Center, and a new commissary at Warrior Way have been completed. Many other improvements were made to improve the Power Projection Mission of the post such as improvements to the railhead and the runway at Gray Army Airfield. Training ranges have been upgraded.

===2000–2009 Army deployments===
At the beginning of the 21st century, the Army's modernization was in full swing. Some of these new advances in technology and war fighting included the fielding of the M1A2 Abrams Main Battle Tank, the M2A2 [[Gulf War|Operation Desert Storm]] (ODS) Bradley Infantry Fighting Vehicle, the [[M109 howitzer|M109A6 Paladin howitzer]], the [[Bell OH-58 Kiowa|OH-58D Kiowa Warrior]], the [[Boeing AH-64 Apache|AH-64D Apache Longbow Helicopter]], and the [[Bradley Fighting Vehicle#M6 Linebacker|M6 Bradley Linebacker]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

Fort Hood was the first installation selected to privatize post housing under the residential communities initiative. Under this initiative, new housing units, remodeled housing and community improvements will be added to the post.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

In 2001, the [[War on Terror]] became a prime focus. Fort Hood transitioned from an open to a closed post with the help of military police from reserve units. The 1st Cavalry sent additional troops to [[Kuwait]] to protect against possible aggressive actions from Iraq. The 4003rd Garrison Support Reserve unit fills vacancies left by deploying units at Fort Hood. Fort Hood has a key role as a training base for mobilizing Reserve and National Guard units to support the Homeland Defense effort.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

Many Fort Hood units have deployed to [[Afghanistan]] for [[Operation Enduring Freedom]], and to [[Iraq]] for [[Iraq War|Operation Iraqi Freedom]]. In December 2003, the 4th Infantry Division captured [[Saddam Hussein]]. In the spring of 2004, the 1st Cavalry Division followed the 4th Infantry Division deploying to Iraq. [[Task Force ODIN]] was created at Ft. Hood.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

In September 2005, 13th COSCOM and key enablers were called to support Joint Task Force [[Hurricane Katrina|Katrina]]/[[Hurricane Rita|Rita]] hurricane relief and went on to serve as the senior joint logistical support command for JTF Katrina. 13th COSCOM eventually provided one hundred million rations, collected human remains with dignity, executed emergency engineering operations, transported, distributed and stored over one billion dollars in humanitarian relief from both non-governmental and federal sources from across the nation.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

In 2009, Fort Carson, [[Colorado]]'s First Army Division West re-stationed to Fort Hood in order to consolidate its mission to conduct [[Reserve components of the United States Armed Forces|reserve component]] mobilization training and validation for deployment, switching places with 4th Infantry Division, which relocated to Fort Carson.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.army.mil/-newsreleases/2009/04/03/19239-force-structure-actions-at-fort-hood-and-other-installations |title=Force Structure Actions at Fort Hood |publisher=U.S. Army Public Affairs. |access-date=5 June 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090619212120/http://www.army.mil/-newsreleases/2009/04/03/19239-force-structure-actions-at-fort-hood-and-other-installations/ |archive-date=19 June 2009}}.  8 June 2009.</ref>

===2007 navigation exercise incident===
On 12 June 2007, the body of Lawrence George Sprader, Jr was found at about 8:30&nbsp;p.m. in a brushy area located within the Central Texas Army post's training ground. He had gone missing for days while conducting an exercise for testing basic map-reading and navigation skills. A massive search had been conducted, with over 3,000 parties scouring the countryside. According to autopsy records, he had died from hyperthermia and dehydration.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/19207170|title=Hyperthermia, dehydration killed Fort Hood GI|date=13 June 2007|publisher=NBC News}}</ref> According to an Army investigatory report, there were "a multitude of procedural violations, judgment errors and alleged acts of misconduct by Army trainers that not only contributed to Sprader's death but put some 300 other soldiers in danger that day, including about two dozen who required medical attention."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2007-08-28-cell-phone-soldier_N.htm|title=AP: Report faults trainers in soldier's death|author=Angela K.

{{main|2009 Fort Hood shooting}}

On 5 November 2009 a gunman, whom regarded himself as a Mujahideen waging "jihad" against the United States, opened fire in the Soldier Readiness Center of Fort Hood and killed 13 people while wounding 32 others. [[Nidal Hasan|Nidal Malik Hasan]], a [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] [[Major (United States)|Major]] and [[psychiatrist]], was the gunman.

==Anti-war activity==
Fort Hood has served as a hub for anti-war activity during both the Vietnam War (e.g. the "[[Fort Hood Three]]" incident) and the [[War on Terror]].

From 1968 to 1973, the [[Oleo Strut (coffeehouse)|Oleo Strut]] was a [[GI Coffeehouses|G.I. coffeehouse]] located near post in Killeen, Texas.<ref name="uth">{{cite web |url=http://www.underthehoodcafe.org/history.html |title=Under the Hood - Oleo Strut History |publisher=Underthehoodcafe.org |date=4 July 1968 |access-date=2012-07-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090903130244/http://www.underthehoodcafe.org/history.html |archive-date=3 September 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The coffee house was featured in the documentary ''[[Sir!

In 2009, the tradition of the Oleo Strut continued when the [[Under the Hood Café]] opened. The location serves as an outreach center for antiwar activists to reach out to area soldiers, and provide them with support.<ref name="uth" /> Under the Hood Café announced on 10 November 2014 that it would close by the end of the year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://underthehoodcafe.org/2014/11/goodbye-to-college-street/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-02-08 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150208024533/http://underthehoodcafe.org/2014/11/goodbye-to-college-street/ |archive-date=8 February 2015}}</ref>

Fort Hood is one of the largest United States military installations in the world, and is the home of [[III Corps (United States)|III Corps]], [[1st Cavalry Division (United States)|1st Cavalry Division]], [[13th Sustainment Command (Expeditionary)|13th Sustainment Command]], [[First United States Army|First Army Division West]], [[3rd Cavalry Regiment (United States)|3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment]], [[1st Medical Brigade (United States)|1st Medical Brigade]] and many other Forces Command and other units.

The [[4th Infantry Division (United States)|4th Infantry Division]] completed its move from Fort Hood to [[Fort Carson]], [[Colorado]], exchanging positions with several units. The 4th Infantry Division Museum closed at Fort Hood for the last time on 29 May 2009 to complete its move to Colorado although most of the outdoor pieces remained at Fort Hood as part of the new 3CR Museum.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dvidshub.net/?script=news/news_show.php&id=33688|title=Ivy Division museum preparing for move to Fort Carson|publisher=dvidshub}}</ref>

Before the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|breakup of the Soviet Union]], Fort Hood was billed as the largest military base in the free world ([[Fort Benning]] is larger in personnel, [[Fort Bliss]] in land area). During peacetime, Fort Hood is a gated post, with the 1st Cavalry Division Museum, the Belton Lake Outdoor Recreation Area (BLORA), and a number of other facilities that are open to the public. Access to the cantonments became restricted starting in July 2001. However, passes are available to visit the two museums on post, and the lake area remains open to the public without restriction since it is outside the cantonments. Various events, including the annual Independence Day celebration, which has one of the largest fireworks displays in the country, are open to the public.

Shortly after the 2000 census, responsibility for post housing was turned over to privatized partnership with [http://www.actuslendlease.com Actus Lend Lease]. Under the terms of the contract, most of the housing has been remodeled or rebuilt, and hundreds of new units have been built or are in the process of being built, operating as [http://www.forthoodfh.com Fort Hood Family Housing]. The nine schools on Fort Hood are part of the [[Killeen Independent School District]].

Fort Hood consists of three sections: the main cantonment, [[West Fort Hood]], and [[North Fort Hood]]. The main cantonment is bounded by Killeen on the east and [[Copperas Cove, Texas|Copperas Cove]] on the west. The Fort Hood main cantonment area, otherwise referred to as Main post, holds its own airfield, [[Hood Army Airfield]]. North Fort Hood is bounded by Gatesville to the northwest. West Fort Hood, bounded by Killeen and Copperas Cove, includes Fort Hood's second airfield, [[Robert Gray Army Airfield]], which has been expanded for civilian use ([[Killeen–Fort Hood Regional Airport]] (GRK)) and additional training areas. To the east and southeast, the reservation is bounded by [[Harker Heights, Texas|Harker Heights]], [[Nolanville, Texas|Nolanville]], [[Belton, Texas|Belton]], and [[Morgan's Point Resort, Texas|Morgan's Point Resort]].
