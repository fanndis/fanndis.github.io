'''Hussain Muhammad Ershad''' ({{lang-bn|হুসেইন মুহাম্মদ এরশাদ}}; 1 February 1930 – 14 July 2019) was a Bangladeshi [[Army Chief of Bangladesh|Army Chief]] and politician who served as the [[President of Bangladesh]] from 1983 to 1990,<ref name=bpedia/> a time many consider to have been a military dictatorship.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/election/2018/11/03/ershad-will-join-dialogue-with-al-with-no-condition|title=Ershad: We have no specific demand at dialogue with PM|date=2018-11-03|website=Dhaka Tribune|access-date=2018-12-27}}</ref><ref name=":1">{{Cite news|url=https://bdnews24.com/11thparliamentaryelection/2018/12/01/ershad-shows-tk-2.8m-cash-says-wife-raushon-has-tk-262m-in-election-affidavit|title=Ershad shows Tk 2.8m cash, says wife Raushon has Tk 262m in election affidavit|work=bdnews24.com|access-date=2018-12-27}}</ref><ref name=":2">{{Cite journal|last=Maniruzzaman|first=Talukder|date=1992|title=The Fall of the Military Dictator: 1991 Elections and the Prospect of Civilian Rule in Bangladesh|journal=Pacific Affairs|volume=65|issue=2|pages=203–224|doi=10.2307/2760169|issn=0030-851X|jstor=2760169}}</ref>

Ershad founded the [[Jatiya Party (Ershad)|Jatiya Party]] in 1986 and became a Member of Parliament for that party in the constituency of [[Rangpur-3]] in 1991, with successful re-election in all subsequent general elections.

During his tenure Ershad pursued [[devolution]] reforms, privatization of nationalised industries; the expansion of the national highway system; and the founding of [[SAARC]]; he committed his nation's forces as an ally to the United States in the [[Gulf War]]. He contributed to developments in infrastructure and socio-economic growth, divesting key nationalised industries. He restored the [[command hierarchy|chain of command]] in the Bangladesh Armed Forces after the turmoil following the [[Assassination of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman|Mujib assassination]].<ref name="codron" /> In 1989, Ershad pushed parliament to make Islam the [[state religion]], in a sharp departure from Bangladesh's original secular constitution.<ref>https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/03/bangladesh-court-upholds-islam-religion-state-160328112919301.html</ref>

Ershad was commissioned into the [[Pakistan Army]] in 1952 from officers training school in [[Kohat]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/15/world/asia/hm-ershad-former-president-of-bangladesh-is-dead-at-89.html|title=H.M.

==Bangladesh Liberation War and independence==
[[File:Hussain Muhammad Ershad.jpg|thumb|left|Ershad in [[Bangabhaban]] (1986)]]

From the beginning of the [[Bangladesh Liberation War]], Ershad was interned along with other Bengali officers stationed in West Pakistan, and held as a [[prisoner of war]].<ref name=encyclopedia/> In 1973 he and the others were repatriated to the new nation of Bangladesh in accordance with the [[Simla Agreement]] between India's [[Indira Gandhi]] and Pakistan's [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]].<ref name=encyclopedia>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-3404702034.html|title=Hussain Mohammad Ershad|encyclopedia=encyclopedia.com|access-date=21 September 2015}}</ref>

After his return, Ershad was appointed [[Adjutant General]] of the [[Bangladesh Army]] by President of Bangladesh [[Sheikh Mujibur Rahman]], the first president of independent Bangladesh. The different experiences during the war of the professional and paramilitary officers and soldiers in Bangladesh, together with the country's diverse cultures and Muslim majority, created instabilities in the years after independence. The members of the army who had been imprisoned or otherwise out of the country during the liberation war later tended to form different political alliances than those who had participated in the war. This long influenced the instability of national politics and the armed forces.<ref name=codron/> Ershad was sent for advanced military courses to the [[National Defence College, India|National Defence University]] (NDU), [[India]].

On 15 August 1975, [[assassination of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman|Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was assassinated]]. Although [[Major General|Maj. Gen.]] [[Ziaur Rahman]] was arrested in a counter-coup on 3 November 1975, he was restored to power in a coup led by Lt. Colonel [[Abu Taher]] on [[National Revolution and Solidarity Day|7 November 1975]]. The [[Chief Justice of Bangladesh]], [[Abu Sadat Mohammad Sayem]], succeeded to the presidency on 7 November 1975 during martial law. At that time, Zia Rahman was appointed as the Deputy [[Chief Martial Law Administrator]]. General Ziaur Rahman was appointed Army Chief by President of Bangladesh [[Khondaker Mostaq Ahmad]]. Rahman appointed Ershad as the Deputy Chief of Army Staff in 1975.

Ziaur Rahman assumed the presidency after legalising the military coups. He revived the multi-party system through the Fifth Amendment of the Bangladesh Constitution. He appointed Ershad as the new [[Chief of Army Staff of the Bangladesh Army|Chief of Army Staff]], promoting him to the rank of lieutenant general.<ref name=bpedia/> Viewed as a professional officer and having a talent for [[Bengali language|Bengali]] speech writing, Ershad soon became the closest politico-military counselor of Ziaur Rahman.<ref name=encyclopedia/>

After the [[assassination of Ziaur Rahman]] on 30 May 1981, Ershad remained loyal to the government.<ref>{{cite news |title=BBC On This Day &#124; 1981: Bangladeshi president assassinated |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/may/30/newsid_4401000/4401129.stm |work=BBC News |date=30 May 1981 |access-date=15 January 2009}}</ref> He ordered the army to suppress the coup attempt by Major General [[Abul Manzoor]].

Ershad came to power in a [[1982 Bangladesh coup d'état|bloodless coup]] on 24 March 1982 as Chief Martial Law Administrator (CMLA). President [[Justice]] [[Abdus Sattar (president)|Sattar]] was replaced with [[A. F. M.

Ershad supported the ''Land Reforms Ordinance of 1984,''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+bd0112) |title=Bangladesh |publisher=Lcweb2.loc.gov |date=24 March 1982}}</ref> which granted important rights to tenants for the first time in the history of Bangladesh. A plan for the divestment of government industries promised to move the country away from socialism.

Ershad played a key role during the founding summit of the countries of the [[South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation]] (SAARC) in 1985, which was held in [[Dhaka]]. Member states of South Asian States agreed to cooperate in politics and economics.<ref>{{cite news |title=SAARC Summit opens in Dhaka |url=http://in.rediff.com/news/2005/nov/12saarc.htm |work=Rediff.com |date=12 November 2005}}</ref> Ershad brought together the leaders of India and Pakistan, [[Rajiv Gandhi]] and [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq]], respectively.

As president, Ershad approved amendments to the [[constitution of Bangladesh]] which declared Islam the state religion, abandoning state [[secularism]].

Ershad imitated his predecessor President Zia in many ways.<ref name="Politics loses its Ershad factor">{{Cite web|url=https://www.thedailystar.net/opinion/tribute/news/politics-loses-its-ershad-factor-1771927|title=Politics loses its Ershad factor|date=2019-07-16|website=The Daily Star|language=en|access-date=2019-09-06}}</ref> Initially, he too installed a civilian president, [[A. F. M. Ahsanuddin Chowdhury|Abul Fazal Muhammed Ahsanuddin Chowdhury]] (March 1982‐December 1983), and became the President only on 11 December 1983. He also floated a state‐sponsored political party, [[Jatiya Party (Ershad)|Jatiya Party]] (JP), composed of various factions from leftist and rightist political parties to support his regime. Like his predecessor, he allowed political parties to be active.{{Original research inline|date=June 2018}}

Jatiyo Party nominated Ershad in the Presidential Election of 1986, which was organised by his government. The only significant opposition candidates were [[Hafezzi Huzur]] and [[Syed Faruque Rahman]], a retired colonel who had been accused in 15 August [[Assassination of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman]]<ref>{{cite book |last=Rahim |first=Enayetur |date=2001 |chapter=Electoral Politics in Bangladesh, 1975–88 |editor-last=Ahmed |editor-first=Rafiuddin |title=Religion, Identity & Politics: Essays on Bangladesh |location=Colorado Springs, CO |publisher=International Academic Publishers |page=104 |isbn=978-1-58868-080-8 |quote="Syed Faruk Rahman, a retired colonel, known to be a key figure in the assassination plot of Sheikh Mujib ...

Main contenders for the parliamentary seats were the Jatiya (People's) Party, formed on 1 January 1986 when the nationwide ban on political activity was lifted, and comprising the five parties which had together formed the pro-government National Front in July 1985 and the opposition leftist Awami League, led by [[Sheikh Hasina]]. The largest political party of the second Parliament, BNP decided to boycott the poll. Election day was held in a climate of unrest and was marked by opposition charges of voting fraud and malpractices. On 10 May, polling was suspended in 109 constituencies. Following re-elections in 37 constituencies on 19 May, final results giving JP an absolute parliamentary majority were announced ten days later. Ershad's JP was declared the winner with 153 seats out of 300. There were 115 opposition and 32 independent members. However, the inaugural House session was boycotted by 119 opposition and independent MPs. The same day, a new cabinet was sworn in. Ershad was elected as President on 15 October 1986.<ref>{{cite web |title=Historical Archive of Parliamentary Election Results: Bangladesh 1986 |url=http://www.ipu.org/parline-e/reports/arc/BANGLADESH_1986_E.PDF |date=1986 |website=Inter-Parliamentary Union |access-date=8 March 2014}}</ref>

However, Ershad faced increasing mass demonstrations on the streets mobilised by both the AL led by Sheikh Hasina and the BNP led by Khaleda Zia. The BNP boycotted the 1986 parliamentary election, but the AL which contested in the parliamentary election, later resigned from the parliament.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Parliament of Bangladesh: Representation and Accountability |url=http://www.cpd.org.bd/pub_attach/CPD_CMI_WP2.pdf |website=Centre for Policy Dialogue (CPD) |access-date=7 March 2014}}</ref>

On 6 December 1987, Ershad dissolved the parliament in the midst of an opposition campaign calling for his and his government's resignation, and a nationwide state of emergency, which had been declared on 27 November. He stated that he wished to pave the way for fresh elections to receive the people's mandate on various national issues. The polling date was originally set for 28 February before being postponed.

Polling day was marked by violence and a boycott by the three leading opposition groups - the Awami League (an eight-party alliance) headed by Sheikha Hasina Wajed, the Moslem Jammai-i-Islami and the right-wing BNP, all of which alleged electoral fraud. In this context, the ruling Jatiya Dal, or Nationalist Party, reportedly increased its parliamentary majority to 251 seats (including 18 unopposed), independents captured 25 seats and several minor parties shared the rest. On 27 March, a new Council of Ministers headed by Mr. Ershad was sworn in. The Prime Minister is Mr. Moudud Ahmed.<ref>{{cite web |title=Historical Archive of Parliamentary Election Results: Bangladesh 1988 |url=http://www.ipu.org/parline-e/reports/arc/BANGLADESH_1988_E.PDF |date=1988 |website=Inter-Parliamentary Union}}</ref>

Ershad's regime has sometimes been characterised{{By whom|date=January 2011}} as the longest autocratic rule in Bangladesh. The two general elections were widely criticised by the opposition parties. BNP boycotted the election in 1986. The government gained legitimacy by the participation of the other major opposition party, Awami League, and [[Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami|Jamaat-e-Islami]], the largest Islamist party in the nation.

===Achievements===
Ershad stabilized the Bangladesh Armed Forces, which had struggled with a series of coups and counter coups since the nation achieved independence in 1971. These arose in part because of the division in the Army between those who had participated in the Bangladesh Liberation War of 1971, and those who had been interned or voluntarily stayed in West Pakistan during the conflict. As those men were repatriated and the Armed Forces needed their participation, they were welcomed back, but complained of discrimination in favour of the freedom fighters.<ref name=codron/> The repatriated officers comprised 60% of the officers and a sizeable interest group.<ref name=codron/> The freedom fighters, part of the development of Bangladesh from the beginning, tended to identify with the Awami League. The repatriated officers tended to identify with the BNP as the opposition. They carried out their rivalries in part through coups.<ref name=codron/>

The Bangladesh Armed Forces did not attempt any coups from Ershad's takeover in 1982 until the fall of the BNP government in 1996.<ref name=codron/> The Awami League in alliance with Jatiya Party won the [[June 1996 Bangladeshi general election|June 1996 general election]].<ref name=codron>{{cite journal

It is also a fact that people often forget to mention the infrastructural development undertaken during his regime specially in the rural and semi-rural areas.

===Issues===
Both the BNP and the Awami League boycotted the [[1988 Bangladeshi general election|1988 general election]]. There were reports of violence, human rights abuse and corruption during Ershad's tenure, which have been continuing problems in the country.

On 15 May 2011, Supreme Court declared the military rule of Ershad illegal in a verdict that also said the actions taken by his regime will remain effective until their fate is decided by parliament. "All proclamations, Martial Law Regulations, Martial Law Orders, made/promulgated during the period between 24 March 1982 and the date of commencement of the Constitution (Seventh Amendment) Act, 1986 (Act 1 of 1986) are hereby declared illegal and void....," the SC said in its brief verdict.<ref>{{cite news|last=Ahmed|first=Siddique|title=Ershad's military rule illegal|url=http://archive.thedailystar.net/newDesign/news-details.php?nid=185874|newspaper=The Daily Star|access-date=25 February 2014}}</ref>

=== Legacy and honours ===
[[File:Jamuna Shetu.jpg|thumb|[[Jamuna Bridge]]]]

The Jamuna Multipurpose Bridge Authority (JMBA) was set up by an ordinance promulgated by the then President Ershad on 3 July 1985 to implement the project. For mobilisation of domestic resources, another ordinance was promulgated by which a Jamuna Bridge surcharge and levy were introduced. A total of Tk 5.08 billion was mobilised in the process till its abolition.

He was honoured twice as a United Nations Laureate during his presidency:
* UN Population Award (1987)<ref name="laureates1"/>

, in recognition of the campaign for an international convention on the protection and conservation of climate, and other contributions.

== Pressure for democracy ==
A wide umbrella of political parties united against Ershad. Khaleda Zia led the BNP, which allied with the Awami League, led by Sheikh Hasina, and [[Jamaat-e-Islami Bangladesh]]. Other Islamic parties and alliances joined the opposition ranks. They called for strikes and protests that paralysed{{explain|date=June 2018}} the state and its economy. Although the parliament was dissolved, fresh elections were boycotted by the opposition, including Awami League and Jamaat. Students launched an intensifying opposition campaign, which ultimately forced Ershad to step down on 6 December 1990. The West, which had backed him for almost a decade, no longer supported him in light of the effective end of Cold War. Lieutenant General [[Nuruddin Khan]] as Chief of the Army Staff, unlike his predecessor Lt Gen [[Atiqur Rahman]], did not back the President.

Ershad appointed Justice [[Shahabuddin Ahmed]] to form an acceptable neutral [[caretaker government]] and prepare for democratic elections. This was an innovation that was not provided for in the constitution. {{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}. Shahabuddin immediately placed Ershad under arrest and detained him, an action declared illegal in 1998 in a case appealed to the nation's [[Supreme court|Supreme Court]].<ref name="news.bbc.co.uk">{{cite news |title=Detention of Bangladeshi leader declared illegal |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/low/world/s/w_asia/61135.stm |work=BBC News |date=1 March 1998 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090606052930/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/low/world/s/w_asia/61135.stm |archive-date=6 June 2009 |access-date=15 January 2009}}</ref>

In 1996, the newly elected government of the Awami League selected Shahabuddin as the President and appointed Lt Gen [[Nuruddin Khan]] as the Energy Minister. After a period, he was demoted to minister without portfolio for gross mismanagement.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/s/w_asia/71207.stm BBC Online]{{dead link|date=May 2013}}{{cbignore}}</ref>

Although anti-Ershad sentiment was strong, Ershad contested the 1996 election from jail and still won all five different constituencies he had contested from in 1991.<ref name="Politics loses its Ershad factor"/> The new government led by the BNP's Khaleda Zia instituted a number of corruption charges. Ershad was convicted in two charges till date, while all others were dismissed and thrown out of court.

In the 1991 and 1996 elections, during when he was in jail, Ershad won from five different constituencies. In 1996, he provided his support to the Awami League and helped form a government of consensus although his party sat on the opposition side of the parliament.

Ershad was released from jail on 9 January 1997 by the government, but only after he provided unconditional support to the Awami League. In March 1998, he was approached by a NY, USA based lobby group to get ready for next election. Somehow he ignored that opportunity and referred the lobby group to Brig. Gen. Illias for further negotiation, thereby losing his opportunity to gain the optimum power to come back in the limelight during 2001 election. It is assumed{{according to whom|date=June 2018}}, during 1998 till mid of 2001, he was guided by JP politicians with very little exposure of international lobbies that made him suffer till 1st quarter of 2013.

In 2008, Ershad supported the Awami League in the December election. It was rumored{{clarify|date=June 2018}} that the party had committed to making him president, but did not.

==Political career since 1991==
Ershad, is the only high-profile politician to be convicted of corruption and serve a prison sentence. Legal complexities tend to prolong the investigation and settlement of the corruption cases against senior politicians in Bangladesh." We really don't know what will be the fate of these cases", lawyer Shahdeen Malik told the BBC.<ref>{{cite news |title=Ex-Bangladesh PM faces court action |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/2705905.stm |work=BBC News |date=29 January 2003 |access-date=15 January 2009}}</ref>

Ershad lost his membership in parliament owing to his conviction on charges of corruption when his relations with the ruling Awami League subsequently deteriorated. He switched his support to his one-time political adversary and main opposition leader, Khaleda Zia forming an anti-government coalition.<ref name="online1">{{cite news |title=Bangladesh general back in jail |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/low/south_asia/1032550.stm |work=BBC News |date=20 November 2000 |access-date=15 January 2009}}</ref> Thus, the questionable court verdict followed.

Both Khaleda Zia of BNP and Sheikh Hasina of Awami League allied together to oust Ershad. Ironically both of these two top parties also allied with him and his Jatiya Party in time of their need to suit their purpose.<ref>{{cite news |last=Ahsan |first=Zayadul |date=31 July 2006 |title=Come polls, come shame |url=http://archive.thedailystar.net/2006/07/31/d6073101033.htm |newspaper=The Daily Star |access-date=15 January 2009}}</ref>

Ershad called President [[Iajuddin Ahmed]] three times along with [[Kazi Zafar Ahmed]] twice on 23 December not to extend two days time for filing nominations for scheduled 22 January 2007 elections when Awami League and its allies decided to join that elections after long parley of [[Mukhlesur Rahman Chowdhury]] with Sheikh Hasina. However, for the sake of continuation of democratic process Chowdhury convinced all concerned that without both Awami League and [[Bangladesh Nationalist Party|BNP]] the election will not be credible.

On 30 June 2007, Ershad stepped down temporarily from the post of Party chairman, indicating an end to his political career.<ref>{{cite news |title=Ershad quits party post: Hands rein to Anisul Islam for reforms in JP |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/2007/07/01/d7070101011.htm |newspaper=The Daily Star |date=1 July 2007 |access-date=15 January 2009}}</ref> It is speculated that he stepped down under pressure as the Caretaker Government started a series of prosecution and arrest for corruption and criminal charges against political leaders of Awami League and BNP including Sheikh Hasina,<ref>{{cite news |title=Police arrest Bangladeshi ex-PM |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/6900177.stm |work=BBC News |date=16 July 2007 |access-date=15 January 2009}}</ref> Khaleda Zia<ref>{{cite news |title=Ex-PM sued on corruption charges in Bangladesh |url=http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/09/02/asia/AS-GEN-Bangladesh-Ex-Prime-Minister.php |newspaper=International Herald Tribune |agency=Associated Press |date=2 September 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090212031648/http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/09/02/asia/AS-GEN-Bangladesh-Ex-Prime-Minister.php |archive-date=12 February 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Bangladesh former PM is arrested |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/6975340.stm |work=BBC News |date=3 September 2007 |access-date=15 January 2009}}</ref> and Zia's son [[Tareq Rahman]]<ref>{{cite news |title=Khaleda Zia's son is refused bail |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/6446065.stm |work=BBC News |date=13 March 2007 |access-date=15 January 2009}}</ref> among others.<ref>{{cite news |title=Those shameless corrupts in Bangladesh |url=http://www.asiantribune.com/index.php?q=node/427 |newspaper=Asian Tribune |access-date=15 January 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=More Confession: Babar cut $10m Warid deal for Koko |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/2007/06/01/d7060101011.htm |newspaper=The Daily Star |date=1 June 2007 |access-date=15 January 2009}}</ref>

===Arrest===
On 1 March 1998, the [[Supreme Court of Bangladesh]] ruled that President Ershad's original arrest in 1990 by the caretaker government, led by Justice Shahabuddin Ahmed, was illegal.<ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"/> This ruling would have permitted Ershad to sue the government for wrongful arrest. Ershad was convicted on a separate and unrelated charge eleven years after this arrest.

=== Charges and convictions ===

Ershad has been convicted and served time for only one case that has been upheld by the Supreme Court of the nation – [[Janata Tower Case]]. When his relations with the ruling Awami League subsequently deteriorated as he joined hands with the other main opposition BNP of Khaleda Zia.

He was found guilty in the Janata corruption case and was sentenced by the trial court to seven years imprisonment. Later the High Court Division affirmed the conviction but reduced the sentence to five years. The people were charged with building the Janata. It involved two charges – abuse of power in allotting land in Dhaka, which took place after Ershad colluded with [[M. M. Rahmat Ullah]]; and possessing unaccounted money. The [[Chief Justice of Bangladesh|Justice]] in his 91-page verdict found Ershad guilty under the Prevention Act.

Ershad was sentenced in corruption case on 20 November 2000. He was released on bail, on 9 April 2001 after serving four months in jail in Dhaka. As a result, he could not contest the [[2001 Bangladeshi general election|2001 elections]].

At the time of his death there were still a few other pending cases against him but most had been thrown out of the court or had cleared him of any wrongdoing. The most famous case that the BNP Government at the time falsely implicated him by was a gold smuggling case.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bangladeshnews.com.bd/2006/11/22/bnp-govt-falsely-implicated-him-in-gold-smuggling-case-in-1991 |url-status=dead |title=BNP govt falsely implicated him in gold smuggling case in 1991 |publisher=Bangladeshnews.com.bd |access-date=15 January 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080830042337/http://www.bangladeshnews.com.bd/2006/11/22/bnp-govt-falsely-implicated-him-in-gold-smuggling-case-in-1991/ |archive-date=30 August 2008}}</ref> This was later thrown out by a Dhaka Court<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bangladeshnews.com.bd/2007/09/19/ershad-gets-acquitted/ |url-status=dead |title=Ershad gets acquitted |publisher=Bangladeshnews.com.bd |access-date=15 January 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205033442/http://www.bangladeshnews.com.bd/2007/09/19/ershad-gets-acquitted/ |archive-date=5 December 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bangladeshnews.com.bd/2006/09/21/case-against-ershad-witnesses-now-know-nothing-about-gold-smuggling/ |url-status=dead |title=Case Against Ershad: Witnesses now know nothing about gold smuggling |publisher=Bangladeshnews.com.bd |access-date=15 January 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090215044449/http://www.bangladeshnews.com.bd/2006/09/21/case-against-ershad-witnesses-now-know-nothing-about-gold-smuggling/ |archive-date=15 February 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allvoices.com/news/882352-ershad-nizami |url-status=dead |title=Bangladesh court acquits Ershad of graft charge |publisher=allvoices.com |access-date=15 January 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110521102800/http://www.allvoices.com/news/882352-ershad-nizami |archive-date=21 May 2011}}</ref>

===Return===

In 2006, he protested against the controversial Election Commissioner (CEC) MA Aziz decisions on holding polls.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bangladeshnews.com.bd/2006/11/21/ershads-jp-now-to-join-street-movement-for-cecs-removal/ |url-status=dead |title=Ershad's JP now to join street movement for CEC's removal |publisher=Bangladeshnews.com.bd |date=21 November 2006 |access-date=15 January 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090407005248/http://www.bangladeshnews.com.bd/2006/11/21/ershads-jp-now-to-join-street-movement-for-cecs-removal/ |archive-date=7 April 2009 |df=dmy }}</ref>

In 2006, as the BNP's term was ending Ershad joined the party's 4-Party Alliance after meetings with Tarique and Babar, which were followed by meeting with Khaleda Zia at her Mainul Road House. However, in late October 2006, he said he was not in the 4-Party Alliance, reversing his position the following day. Then he went into hiding for 3 days and joined the Awami League's Grand Alliance at Paltan Maidan with Sheikh Hasina. 

But Hasina later breached the agreement between the two which promised to make Ershad the President for at least six months. Moeen also committed to make him President before 11 January 2007, but did not. Earlier, Ershad had been offered the position of head of the Government in 1991 by Sheikh Hasina while he was in jail, as well as by Khaleda Zia in 1996 just before the Awami League formed the government after a period of 21 years.<ref>{{cite news|script-title=bn:এরশাদের ভারতপ্রেম রাজনীতিতে নতুন ছক! |url=http://banglanews24.com/detailsnews.php?nssl=5c0b22ae24d0082d80a0d52feb219798&nttl=22082012134014 |url-status=dead |language=bn |work=Banglanews24.com |date=22 August 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140110130004/http://www.banglanews24.com/detailsnews.php?nssl=5c0b22ae24d0082d80a0d52feb219798&nttl=22082012134014 |archive-date=10 January 2014}}</ref> Then, Ershad had joined the 4-Party alliance after the 1996 elections, but left later.

On 8 April 2008, Ershad took charge of his Jatiya Party once again.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bangladeshnews.com.bd/2008/04/08/ershad-claims-party-top-post-again |url-status=dead |title=Ershad claims party top post again. |publisher=Bangladeshnews.com.bd |access-date=15 January 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081204145622/http://www.bangladeshnews.com.bd/2008/04/08/ershad-claims-party-top-post-again/ |archive-date=4 December 2008 |df=dmy }}</ref> On 19 November 2008, Jatiya Party and Awami League agreed to contest the elections jointly under the Caretaker Government to be held on 29 December 2008. Out of the 300 constituencies in the parliament, Ershad's Jatiya Party contested from 49 (later 42 as Awami League did not pull back its candidates from few seats as agreed earlier) seats and Awami League and members of a leftist Fourteen Party Coalition from the rest 250 seats.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bangladeshnews.com.bd/2008/11/19/jp-aboard-al-polls-boat |url-status=dead |title=JP aboard AL polls boat |publisher=Bangladesh News |date=19 November 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810005427/http://www.bangladeshnews.com.bd/2008/11/19/jp-aboard-al-polls-boat/ |archive-date=10 August 2011}}</ref> Thus, the Grand Alliance emerged in Bangladesh.

Ershad contested the [[Bangladesh Parliamentary Election 2008]] from three constituencies. According to Bangladesh electoral laws, a person is allowed to contest from three places, but can retain only one seat and two are to have by-elections after formation of government. These constituencies included Rangpur ([[Rangpur-3]] and [[Kurigram-2]]), and [[Dhaka-17]], the capital's diplomatic zone, where he resides. He won all three seats in the election.

The 2014 Election was a controversial election for Jatiya Party where Ershad's spokesperson [[Bobby Hajjaj]] had first publicly declared that Jatiya Party would not participate in the election. After the 2014 election, Ershad became the special envoy of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in the Awami League-led government. Jatiya Party became the opposition party and [[Rowshan Ershad]], Ershad's wife, became the leader of the opposition.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://bdnews24.com/bangladesh/2017/03/27/new-high-court-bench-assigned-to-hear-ershads-appeal-in-1991-graft-case|title=New High Court bench assigned to hear Ershad's appeal in 1991 graft case|work=bdnews24.com|date=27 March 2017}}</ref> Despite being in the opposition party some leaders of Jatiya Party were also in the government cabinet.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://en.prothom-alo.com/opinion/news/142079/Dangers-of-inter-and-intra-party-violence |url-status=dead |title=Dangers of inter and intra party violence|work=Prothom Alo|date=13 March 2017|access-date=17 August 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170817162655/http://en.prothom-alo.com/opinion/news/142079/Dangers-of-inter-and-intra-party-violence|archive-date=17 August 2017}}</ref> In January 2016, Ershad's brother, [[GM Quader]], was made the vice chairman of the party.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://bdnews24.com/politics/2016/01/17/ershad-makes-brother-gm-quader-jatiya-party-co-chairman|title=Ershad makes brother GM Quader Jatiya Party co-chairman|work=bdnews24.com|date=17 January 2016}}</ref> In April 2016, Ershad appointed Rowshan as the vice-chairman of the party.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://bdnews24.com/politics/2016/04/28/ershad-makes-raushon-senior-co-chairman-of-jatiya-party|title=Ershad makes Raushon senior co-chairman of Jatiya Party|work=bdnews24.com|date=28 April 2016}}</ref> In March 2017, Ershad indicated he might form a new political alliance with 14 other parties.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thedailystar.net/backpage/jatiya-party-float-new-alliance-soon-1372636|title=Jatiya Party to float new alliance soon|date=8 March 2017|work=The Daily Star}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://en.prothom-alo.com/bangladesh/news/143823/Will-form-another-grand-alliance-Ershad |url-status=dead |title=Will form another grand alliance: Ershad|work=Prothom Alo|date=30 March 2017|access-date=17 August 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170817163157/http://en.prothom-alo.com/bangladesh/news/143823/Will-form-another-grand-alliance-Ershad|archive-date=17 August 2017}}</ref> For the next general election, the Jatiya Party under Ershad formed a 58 party grand alliance of its own.
