A '''gay icon''' is a public figure who is highly regarded and beloved by the [[LGBT]] community. A gay icon can either be a part of the LGBT community or heterosexual, but heterosexual gay icons are often highly supportive of their fans within the community and the rights of LGBT people. Organizations such as [[GLAAD]] routinely recognize public figures for their contributions and support for the LGBT community. Gay icons exist across cultures, most prominently in North and South America, Europe, and Asia.

Many gay icons are celebrities in the entertainment industry, but can also include figures in politics, history, sports, literature, and other mediums. Prominent entertainers considered to be gay icons often incorporate themes of acceptance, self-love, and sexuality in their work. Gay icons of all orientations have acknowledged the role that their gay fans have played in their success, including [[Lady Gaga]], [[Bette Midler]], [[Liza Minnelli]], [[Cher]], [[Diana Ross]], [[Madonna]], [[Janet Jackson]], [[Kylie Minogue]], [[Mariah Carey]], [[Spice Girls]], [[Britney Spears]], [[Cheryl (singer)|Cheryl]], [[Marina Diamandis]], [[Christina Aguilera]], and [[Lana Del Rey]]. Politicians considered to be gay icons typically attain their status in the LGBT community for consistently supporting and advocating for LGBT rights.

[[Marie Antoinette]] was an early lesbian icon. Rumors about her relationships with women circulated in pornographic detail by anti-royalist pamphlets before the [[French Revolution]]. In [[Victorian era|Victorian England]], biographers who idealized the [[Ancien Régime]] made a point of denying the rumours, but at the same time romanticised Marie Antoinette's "sisterly" friendship with the [[Princesse de Lamballe]] as—in the words of an 1858 biography—one of the "rare and great loves that Providence unites in death."<ref name="afraser" /> By the end of the 19th century, she was a cult icon of "[[Terminology of homosexuality#Sapphism|sapphism]]." Her execution, seen as tragic martyrdom, may have added to her appeal.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

Allusions to her appearance were made in early 20th century [[lesbian literature]]—most notably [[Radclyffe Hall]]'s ''[[The Well of Loneliness]]''—where the gay playwright Jonathan Brockett describes Marie Antoinette and de Lamballe as "poor souls... sick to death of the subterfuge and pretenses."<ref name="Castle">{{cite book |last=Castle |first=Terry |title=The Apparitional Lesbian: Female Homosexuality and Modern Culture |publisher=[[Columbia University Press]] |year=1993 |location=New York |pages=126–149 and 261n56 |isbn=0-231-07652-5}}</ref> She had crossover appeal as a gay icon, as well, at least for French novelist, playwright, poet, essayist, and political activist [[Jean Genet]], who was fascinated by her story.

==Modern==
[[File:James Dean-cigarette-full.jpg|upright|left|thumb|[[James Dean]] became an icon for lesbians in the 1950s]]
Modern gay icons in entertainment include film stars and musicians, most of whom have strong, distinctive personalities, and many of whom died young or under tragic circumstances. For example, Greek-American opera singer [[Maria Callas]]—who reached her peak in the 1950s—became a gay icon because the uniquely compelling qualities of her stage performances were allied to a tempestuous private life, a sequence of unhappy love affairs, and a lonely premature death in Paris after her voice had deserted her.

Lesbian icons, sometimes called "dykons" (a [[portmanteau]] of the words "dyke" and "icon") are most often powerful women who are, or are rumored to be, lesbian or bisexual.<ref name=Dykon>Euan Ferguson, [https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2003/feb/16/features.review147 Daniela's still dying for it]; February 16, 2003; Retrieved February 8, 2007: ''All over the South-East men fell in lust with the idea of a fast lippy sexy Scot, and I'm told she also became something of a dykon, a female gay icon.''</ref><ref name="POP">{{cite web |url=https://www.popmatters.com/pm/column/gay-icons-judy-who/ |title=Queer, Isn't It?: Gay Icons: Judy Who? |date=November 16, 2006 |accessdate=August 1, 2007 |first=Michael |last=Abernethy |work=[[PopMatters]]}}</ref> However, a few male entertainers have also had iconic status for lesbian people.

Gay icons may be homosexual or heterosexual, out or [[Coming out|in the closet]], male or female. The women most commonly portrayed by [[drag queen]]s are usually gay icons. The definition of what it means to be a "gay icon" has come under criticism in recent years for a lack of substance. [[Paul Flynn (politician)|Paul Flynn]] of ''[[The Guardian]]'' wrote, "The concept of gay icon is a cheap ticket...[and] the idea of gay iconography itself is currently replaceable with the idea of popularity and the ability to carry a strong, identifiable, [[trademark look|signature look]]."<ref name=EYE>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2006/may/16/bypaulflynn |title=Margaret Thatcher: gay icon |last=Flynn |first=Paul |work=The Guardian |location=London|date=May 16, 2006 |accessdate=April 17, 2017}}</ref> Author [[Michael Thomas Ford]] depicts a similar attitude in his work of fiction ''Last Summer''.

====1930s–1940s====
The 1930s saw a number of writers, political activists, and celebrities garner reputations as gay icons. Poet and satirical writer [[Dorothy Parker]] had a large gay following. The phrase "[[friend of Dorothy]]" was code for gay and is attributed to both Parker and the popular Judy Garland role in ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard Of Oz]]'' (1939).

The expression "Is he a friend of Dorothy?" was slang for "Is he gay?"<ref name="Gayle" /> The character Dorothy meets an odd group of friends during her journey through Oz—the Tin Man, the Cowardly Lion and the Scarecrow—and so referring to an individual as a "friend of Dorothy" meant that they were "unusual or odd" and, therefore, "queer".<ref name="Gayle" /> Though Garland has been noted for her embodiment of [[camp (style)|camp]] in her acting roles, Bronski argues that she was the "antithesis of camp" and "made a legend of her pain and oppression."<ref name="Culture Clash" /> As Bronski observes, the bleak setting of 1950s Hollywood had replaced the "sauciness of the [1930s] and the independence of the [1940s]."<ref name="Culture Clash" /> Garland, as well as [[Lana Turner]], epitomized the idea that "suffering was the price of glamor...[and] the women stars of the [1950s] reflected the condition of many gay men: they suffered, beautifully".<ref name="Culture Clash" />

Garland's daughter, [[Liza Minnelli]], would later follow in her mother's footsteps as a gay icon, as would fellow musical artist [[Barbra Streisand]].<ref name="POP" /><ref name="terra.com.ar"/> [[Joan Crawford]] has been described as the "ultimate gay icon—the martyr who suffered for her art and, therefore, enabled herself to bond with this all-important faction of her fanbase."<ref name="Joan Crawford">{{cite book |last=Bret |first=David |title=Joan Crawford: Hollywood Martyr |publisher=Da Capo Press |year=2008 |pages=192, 287 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-cf2gT2bRG8C |isbn=978-0-306-81624-6}}</ref> In ''Joan Crawford: The Essential Biography'', author [[Lawrence J.

Bret explains that seeing the actress' red hair, dark eyes and "Victory Red" lips linked her to "gaydom's other sirens: Dietrich, Garland, [[Tallulah Bankhead|Bankhead]], [[Édith Piaf|Piaf]], and new recruits [[Marilyn Monroe]] and Maria Callas."<ref name="Joan Crawford" />

Actress [[Lucille Ball]] was also a prominent icon from this period.

====1970s====
During the late 1970s, many female comedians appeared, joining the ranks of what had stereotypically been a male profession, including [[Joan Rivers]], who began appearing on ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]''. Rivers gained a strong gay following after performing in [[Greenwich Village]], an LGBT friendly area of New York, from the early days of her career. Rivers' frank and sharp use of wit and insults (largely turned toward herself) made her an instant gay icon.

Singer [[Sylvester (singer)|Sylvester]] became a gay icon after releasing his [[Hi-NRG]] single "[[You Make Me Feel (Mighty Real)]]" in 1978. Sylvester often made appearances in [[Drag queen|drag]], and often described as a disco diva because of his [[falsetto]] voice and flamboyant appearance. He also influenced the gay nightclub scene in the late seventies and eighties.

Singer [[Cass Elliot]] became known as a gay icon, both during her solo career and as a member of [[The Mamas & the Papas]]. Her musical impact became known through her camp fashion and lyrics praising individuality (such as "[[Make Your Own Kind of Music (song)|Make Your Own Kind of Music]]" and "Different") and free love. Her music was later featured in the acclaimed gay film ''[[Beautiful Thing (film)|Beautiful Thing]]'' (1996), adapted from the play of the same name.

Singer and actress [[Bette Midler]] became recognized as a gay icon in the 1970s. After performing on Broadway, Midler began performing at the [[Continental Baths]], a [[gay bathhouse]] in the city, where she became close to her piano accompanist [[Barry Manilow]], who produced her first major album ''[[The Divine Miss M]]'' (1973). "Despite the way things turned out [with the AIDS crisis], I'm still proud of those days [singing at gay bathhouses]. I feel like I was at the forefront of the gay liberation movement, and I hope I did my part to help it move forward.

In the mid- to late-1980s, [[Oprah Winfrey]] emerged as an icon for the gay community with an intimate confessional communication style that altered the cultural landscape. According to the book ''Freaks Talk Back'' by Yale sociologist [[Joshua Gamson]], the [[tabloid talk show]] genre popularized by Oprah Winfrey and [[Phil Donahue]], did more to make gay people mainstream and socially acceptable than any other development of the 20th century by providing decades of high-impact media visibility for sexual nonconformists.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.press.uchicago.edu/presssite/metadata.epl?mode=synopsis&bookkey=40916 |title=Freaks Talk Back: Tabloid Talk Shows and Sexual Nonconformity, Gamson |publisher=Press.uchicago.edu |accessdate=April 9, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Coming after Oprah: Cultural Fallout in the Age of the TV Talk Show (9780879727529): Vicki Abt, Leonard Mustazza: Books |url=https://archive.org/details/comingafteroprah00abtv |url-access=registration |isbn = 0879727527|last1 = Abt|first1 = Vicki|last2 = Mustazza|first2 = Leonard|year = 1997}}</ref>

Fellow gay icon [[Ellen DeGeneres]] cast Winfrey to play the therapist she comes out of the closet to on the controversial episode of her ''[[Ellen (TV series)|Ellen]]'' sitcom. Though Winfrey abandoned her tabloid talk show format in the mid-1990s as the genre became flooded by more extreme clones like [[Ricki Lake]], [[Jenny Jones (presenter)|Jenny Jones]] and [[Jerry Springer]], she continued to broadcast shows that were perceived as gay-friendly. Her show ''[[Oprah's Big Give]]'' was the first reality TV show with an openly gay host [[Nate Berkus]]. Her own show has been nominated several times for [[GLAAD Media Award]]s, and another in 2010 for an interview with Ellen DeGeneres and her wife [[Portia de Rossi]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.queerty.com/glaad-glad-name-media-award-nominees-20080121/ |title=GLAAD Glad Name Media Award Nominees / Queerty |publisher=Queerty.com |date=January 21, 2008 |accessdate=April 9, 2012}}</ref> winning one in 2007<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.keithboykin.com/arch/2007/03/27/patti_labelle_w |first1=Keith |last1=Boykin |title=Patti LaBelle Wins GLAAD Media Award |work=Keithboykin.com |date=March 27, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081121222209/http://www.keithboykin.com/arch/2007/03/27/patti_labelle_w |archive-date=November 21, 2008 |url-status=dead |accessdate=October 1, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/arts/media/story/2010/03/14/glaad-media-awards.html |title=Cynthia Nixon, Joy Behar win gay media awards – Arts & Entertainment – CBC News |publisher=CBC |location=Canada |date=March 14, 2010 |accessdate=April 9, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100317132740/http://www.cbc.ca/arts/media/story/2010/03/14/glaad-media-awards.html |archive-date=March 17, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Oprah Winfrey also co-produced the Oscar-winning film ''[[Precious: Based on the Novel "Push" by Sapphire|Precious]]'' (2009), which was honored by GLAAD for portraying a lesbian couple as heroines.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.moviefone.ca/2010/01/13/precious-a-single-man-among-glaad-nominees/ |title='Precious,' 'A Single Man' Among GLAAD Nominees |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706185853/http://www.moviefone.ca/2010/01/13/precious-a-single-man-among-glaad-nominees/ |archive-date=July 6, 2011 |accessdate=October 1, 2016}}</ref>

Winfrey's iconic status among gay males has entered the popular culture.

==Fictional==
Various fictional characters have been regarded as gay icons, including cartoon figures. [[Bugs Bunny]], a fictional [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] rabbit appearing in animation by [[Warner Bros. Cartoons]] during the [[Golden Age of American animation]]—dubbed the greatest cartoon character of all time by ''[[TV Guide]]''—has been declared a "queer cultural icon [and] parodic diva" due to his "cross-dressing antics" and camp appeal.<ref>{{cite news|title=Bugs Bunny tops greatest cartoon characters list |url=http://archives.cnn.com/2002/SHOWBIZ/TV/07/30/cartoon.characters/index.html |publisher=CNN |date=July 30, 2002 |accessdate=February 27, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080208043937/http://archives.cnn.com/2002/SHOWBIZ/TV/07/30/cartoon.characters/index.html |archive-date=February 8, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Murray |first=Raymond |title=Images in the Dark: An Encyclopedia of Gay and Lesbian Film and Video |publisher=TLA Publications |year=1994 |page=[https://archive.org/details/imagesindarkency00murr/page/455 455] |url=https://archive.org/details/imagesindarkency00murr |url-access=registration |isbn=1-880707-01-2}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=McGowan |first=Kate |title=The Year's Work in Critical and Cultural Theory: 1995 |publisher=Blackwell Publishing |year=1998 |page=129 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T7pSf0PZteEC |isbn=0-631-20896-8}}</ref>

Some comic book characters are considered gay icons. Homosexual interpretations of [[Batman]] and the original [[Robin (comics)|Robin]], [[Dick Grayson]], have been of interest in cultural and academic study, due primarily to psychologist [[Fredric Wertham]]'s ''[[Seduction of the Innocent]]'' (1954).<ref name="The Complete History">{{cite book |last=Daniels |first=Les |first2=Chip |last2=Kidd |title=Batman: The Complete History |publisher=Chronicle Books |year=2004 |page=69 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=73wknu2cVIkC |isbn=0-8118-4232-0}}</ref> In the mid-1950s, Wertham led a national campaign against comic books, convincing Americans that they were responsible for corrupting children and encouraging them to engage in acts of sex and violence.<ref name="The Complete History" /> In relation to Batman and Robin, Wertham asserted "the Batman type of story helps to fixate homoerotic tendencies by suggesting the form of an adolescent-with-adult or [[Ganymede (mythology)|Ganymede]]-[[Zeus]] type of love-relationship".<ref name="Seduction">{{cite book |last=Bosmajian |first=Haig A. |title=Burning Books |publisher=McFarland |year=2006 |page=202 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UkAXPuObVBUC |isbn=0-7864-2208-4}}</ref>

In ''Containing America: Cultural Production and Consumption in Fifties America'', authors Nathan Abrams and Julie Hughes point out that homosexual interpretations of Batman and Robin existed prior to Wertham's ''Seduction of the Innocent''.<ref name="Fifties America">{{cite book |last=Abrams |first=Nathan |first2=Julie|last2=Hughes|title=Containing America: Cultural Production and Consumption in Fifties America |publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group |year=2005 |page=163 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qhLZsBLjV28C |isbn=1-902459-06-7}}</ref> Wertham claimed his book was, in fact, prompted by the earlier research of a California psychiatrist.<ref name="Fifties America" /> The relationship between Batman and arch villain the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]] has also been interpreted by many as homoerotic. [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]], author of ''[[The Dark Knight Returns]]'', has described the relationship between Batman and the Joker as a "homophobic nightmare," and views the character as sublimating his sexual urges into crime fighting, concluding, "He'd be much healthier if he were gay."<ref name=batman>{{cite book |last=Sharrett |first=Christopher |chapter=Batman and the Twilight of the Idols: An Interview with Frank Miller |title=The Many Lives of the Batman: Critical Approaches to a Superhero and His Media |publisher=Routledge |location=London |year=1991 |isbn=0-85170-276-7 |pages=37–38}}</ref>

One TV series that appeals most to [[LGBT culture]] is the 1960s sitcom ''[[Bewitched]]''. Aside from the campy characterizations, it contained three gay cast members ([[Dick Sargent]], [[Paul Lynde]] and—allegedly—[[Agnes Moorehead]]). Star [[Elizabeth Montgomery]] and Sargent were grand marshals of a Los Angeles [[gay pride parade]] in the early 1990s. Another example is [[Bianca Montgomery]] of ''[[All My Children]]''.<ref name="WWW.afterellen.com">{{cite web|first=Lisa |last=Yimm |title=Olga Sosnovska, AMC's Unlikely Lesbian Icon |publisher=[[AfterEllen.com]] |date=April 2004 |accessdate=April 7, 2008 |url=http://www.afterellen.com/archive/ellen/TV/amc-olga.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080116110907/http://www.afterellen.com/archive/ellen/TV/amc-olga.html |archive-date=January 16, 2008 |df=mdy }}</ref>

In 2016, several [[Tumblr]] users joked that the titular character of [[The Babadook]], a 2014 [[psychological horror]] film directed by [[Jennifer Kent]], was gay.

Many celebrities have responded positively to being regarded as gay icons, several noting the loyalty of their gay fans. [[Eartha Kitt]] and [[Cher]] credited gay fans with keeping them going at times when their careers had faltered.<ref name=gbl>{{cite book |last=Rutledge |first=Leigh W. |title=The Gay Book of Lists, 3rd Edition |publisher=[[Alyson Publications]] |year=2003 |location=Los Angeles, CA |pages=87–88 |isbn=1-55583-740-9}}</ref> [[Kylie Minogue]] has acknowledged the perception of herself as a gay icon and has performed at such events as the [[Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras]]. Asked to explain the reason for her large gay fanbase, Minogue replied, "It's always difficult for me to give the definitive answer because I don't have it. My gay audience has been with me from the beginning ... they kind of adopted me." She noted that she differed from many gay icons who were seen as tragic figures, with the comment, "I've had a lot of tragic hairdos and outfits.

Others have been more ambivalent. [[Mae West]], a gay icon from the early days of her career, supported [[gay rights]] but bristled when her performance style was referred to as camp.<ref name="maewest">{{cite book |last=Watts |first=Jill |title=Mae West: An Icon in Black and White |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]], USA |year=2001 |location=New York |page=300 |isbn=0-19-510547-8}}</ref>
