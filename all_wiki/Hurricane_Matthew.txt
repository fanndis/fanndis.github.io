'''Hurricane Matthew''' was the first [[List of Category 5 Atlantic hurricanes|Category&nbsp;5 Atlantic hurricane]] since [[Hurricane Felix|Felix]] in [[2007 Atlantic hurricane season|2007]]. Matthew caused catastrophic damage and a [[humanitarian crisis]] in [[Haiti]], as well as widespread devastation in the [[southeastern United States]]. The deadliest [[Atlantic hurricane]] since [[Hurricane Stan]] in [[2005 Atlantic hurricane season|2005]], Matthew was the thirteenth [[tropical cyclone naming|named storm]], fifth [[hurricane]] and second [[major hurricane]] of the [[2016 Atlantic hurricane season]]. It caused extensive damage to landmasses in the [[Greater Antilles]], and severe damage in several islands of the [[Bahamas]] which were still recovering from [[Hurricane Joaquin|Joaquin]], which had pounded such areas nearly a year earlier. At one point, the hurricane even threatened to be the first storm of [[major hurricane|Category 3 or higher]] intensity to strike the [[United States]] since [[Hurricane Wilma|Wilma]] in 2005, but Matthew stayed just offshore, paralleling the [[Florida]] coastline.

Originating from a [[tropical wave]] that emerged off Africa on September&nbsp;22, Matthew developed into a [[tropical storm]] just east of the [[Lesser Antilles]] on September&nbsp;28. It became a hurricane north of [[Venezuela]] and [[Colombia]] on September&nbsp;29, before undergoing [[rapid intensification|explosive intensification]], ultimately reaching Category&nbsp;5 intensity on October&nbsp;1 at just 13.4°N latitude – the lowest latitude ever recorded for a storm of this intensity in the Atlantic basin, breaking the record set by [[Hurricane Ivan]] in 2004.<ref name="TCR"/> Matthew weakened slightly and fluctuated in intensity while making a northward turn toward the [[Greater Antilles]], remaining a strong Category&nbsp;4 hurricane as it made its first [[landfall]] over Haiti's [[Tiburon Peninsula]] early on October&nbsp;4, and then a second one in [[Cuba]] later that day. Matthew weakened somewhat but re-intensified as it tracked northwest, making landfall in the northern [[Bahamas]]. The storm then paralleled the coast of the southeastern United States over the next 36 hours, gradually weakening while remaining just offshore before making its fourth and final landfall over the [[Cape Romain National Wildlife Refuge]] near [[McClellanville, South Carolina|McClellanville]], [[South Carolina]] as a Category&nbsp;1 hurricane on the morning of October&nbsp;8. Matthew re-emerged into the Atlantic shortly afterward, eventually completing its transition into an [[extratropical cyclone]] as it turned away from [[Cape Hatteras, North Carolina|Cape Hatteras]], [[North Carolina]] on October&nbsp;9. The remnants of Matthew continued to accelerate towards [[Canada]] where it was absorbed by a cold front.<ref name="TWC Storm History">{{cite web|url=https://weather.com/storms/hurricane-central/matthew-2016/AL142016|date=October 3, 2016|publisher=[[The Weather Channel]]|accessdate=16 October 2016|title=Matthew Storm History}}</ref>

Widespread effects were felt from Matthew across its destructive path, however, [[Effects of Hurricane Matthew in Haiti|the most significant impacts were felt in Haiti]], with [[United States dollar|US$]]2.8&nbsp;billion in damage and 546&nbsp;deaths, making Matthew the worst disaster to affect the nation since the [[2010 Haiti earthquake|2010 earthquake]]. The combination of flooding and high winds disrupted telecommunications and destroyed extensive swaths of land; around 80% of [[Jérémie]] sustained significant damage. Four people were killed in Cuba due to a bridge collapse, and total losses in the country amounted to US$2.58&nbsp;billion, most of which occurred in the Guantánamo Province. Passing through the Bahamas as a major hurricane, Matthew spread damage across several islands.  [[Grand Bahama]] was hit directly, where most homes sustained damage in the townships of Eight Mile Rock and Holmes Rock. Preparations began in earnest across the southeastern United States as Matthew approached, with several states declaring [[state of emergency|states of emergencies]] for either entire states or coastal counties; widespread evacuations were ordered for extensive areas of the coast because of predicted high wind speeds and flooding, especially in the [[Jacksonville]] Metropolitan Area. In Florida, over 1&nbsp;million lost power as the storm passed to the east, with 478,000&nbsp;losing power in Georgia and South Carolina. While damage was primarily confined to the coast in Florida and Georgia, torrential rains spread inland in the [[Carolinas]] and [[Virginia]], causing widespread flooding.

==Meteorological history==
{{main|Meteorological history of Hurricane Matthew}} 
{{storm path|Matthew 2016 track.png}}
A vigorous [[tropical wave]] moved off the coast of [[Africa]] on September 22 and moved rapidly across the Atlantic, being monitored by the [[National Hurricane Center]] (NHC) for possible [[tropical cyclogenesis]]. Despite possessing tropical-storm winds as it approached the [[Lesser Antilles]] on September&nbsp;27, the wave could not initially be classified as a tropical cyclone, as reconnaissance aircraft could not find a closed center. However, by 12:00&nbsp;UTC on September 28, the wave developed a closed circulation while located near [[Barbados]], hence becoming a tropical storm, and was assigned the name ''Matthew''. Continuing westward under the influence of a mid-level ridge, the storm steadily intensified to attain hurricane intensity by 18:00&nbsp;UTC on September&nbsp;29. The effects of southwesterly wind shear unexpectedly abated late that day, and Matthew began a period of [[rapid intensification|explosive intensification]]; during a 24-hour period beginning at 00:00&nbsp;UTC on September&nbsp;30, the cyclone's maximum winds more than doubled, from 80&nbsp;mph (130&nbsp;km/h) to 165&nbsp;mph (270&nbsp;km/h), making Matthew a Category 5 hurricane,<ref name="TCR">{{cite techreport|url={{NHC TCR url|id=AL142016_Matthew}}|title=Tropical Cyclone Report: Hurricane Matthew|author=Stewart, Stacy R|date=April 3, 2017|accessdate=April 5, 2017|publisher=United States National Hurricane Center|format=PDF}}</ref> the first since [[Hurricane Felix|Felix]] in 2007;<ref>{{cite report|author=Lixion A.

Due to [[upwelling]] of cooler waters, Matthew weakened to a Category&nbsp;4 hurricane later on October&nbsp;1, before attaining a secondary peak intensity with winds of 155&nbsp;mph (250&nbsp;km/h) late on October&nbsp;2.<ref name="TCR"/>

Slowly rounding the ridge, Matthew fluctuated in intensity within the Category&nbsp;4 range from October&nbsp;1–5. Intensification resumed again late on October 3 and culminated when Matthew made landfall near [[Les Anglais]], [[Haiti]], around 11:00&nbsp;UTC on October&nbsp;4 with winds of 150&nbsp;mph (240&nbsp;km/h) and a pressure of {{convert|934|mbar|inHg}}, making it the strongest to hit Haiti since [[Hurricane Cleo|Cleo]] in 1964. Continuing northward, the hurricane struck [[Maisí]] in Cuba early on October&nbsp;5 as a slightly weaker storm. Cuba's and Haiti's mountainous terrain weakened Matthew to Category&nbsp;3 status, as it began to accelerate northwestwards through [[the Bahamas]]. Restrengthening occurred as Matthew's circulation became better organized, with the storm becoming a Category&nbsp;4 hurricane again while passing [[Freeport, Bahamas|Freeport]]. However, Matthew began to weaken again as an [[eyewall replacement cycle]] took place. The storm significantly weakened while closely paralleling the coasts of Florida and Georgia, the western portion of the outer eyewall came ashore in Florida as a Category&nbsp;3 hurricane, while the inner eyewall remained just offshore. Matthew weakened to a Category&nbsp;2 hurricane late on October&nbsp;7 and then to a Category&nbsp;1 hurricane by 12:00&nbsp;UTC on October&nbsp;8.<ref name="TCR"/>

Around 15:00&nbsp;UTC on October&nbsp;8, the hurricane made landfall at [[Cape Romain National Wildlife Refuge]], near [[McClellanville, South Carolina]], with winds of 85&nbsp;mph (140&nbsp;km/h) and a central pressure of {{convert|963|mbar|inHg|abbr=on}}, which made it the strongest to strike the United States in terms of pressure since [[Hurricane Irene|Irene]] in 2011, and the first hurricane to make landfall north of Florida in October since [[Hurricane Hazel]] in 1954.{{refn|group=nb|Although [[Hurricane Sandy]] was significantly deeper and made landfall much farther north in late October 2012, it was an [[extratropical cyclone]] at the time of landfall.}}<ref>{{cite web|url=https://webcms.colostate.edu/tropical/media/sites/111/2016/10/matthew.pdf|title=Hurricane Matthew Records/Notable Facts Recap (through October 8)|work=[[Colorado State University]]|date=October 8, 2016|accessdate=March 25, 2017}}</ref><ref name="TCR"/> Convection became displaced from the center as Matthew pulled away from land due to increasing wind shear, with the NHC declaring the system an [[extratropical cyclone]] about 200&nbsp;mi (320&nbsp;km) east of [[Cape Hatteras, North Carolina]], on October&nbsp;9. The remnants persisted for another day, before they were absorbed by a [[cold front]].<ref name="TCR"/>

===Records===
Matthew set several records during its long and destructive journey. Matthew intensified into a Category&nbsp;5 hurricane at a [[latitude]] of 13.4&nbsp;degrees north, breaking the record set by [[Hurricane Ivan|Ivan]] in 2004, which had reached that intensity at a latitude of 13.7&nbsp;degrees north.<ref name="TCR"/> Matthew also maintained at least Category&nbsp;4 status for the longest duration on record for the month of October, according to Phil Klotzbach of [[Colorado State University]], doing so for roughly 5 days.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/philklotzbach/status/783288907022475264|title=Philip Klotzbach on Twitter|work=twitter.com|accessdate=April 10, 2017}}</ref>

===Retirement===
{{See also|List of retired Atlantic hurricane names}}
On March&nbsp;26, 2017, it was announced by the [[World Meteorological Organization]] that the name ''Matthew'' was retired, due to the extensive damage and loss of life it caused along its track, particularly in Haiti, Cuba, and the United States, and will never again be used to name an [[Atlantic hurricane]]. It will be replaced with ''Martin'' for the 2022 Atlantic hurricane season.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.noaa.gov/media-release/world-meteorological-organization-retires-storm-names-matthew-and-otto|title=World Meteorological Organisation retires storm names Matthew and Otto|work=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]|date=27 March 2017|accessdate=27 March 2017}}</ref>

=== Response efforts ===
[[Direct Relief]], an emergency response organization, delivered a large emergency medical aid airlift to Haiti. The organization used a 757 plane, donated by FedEx, that contained 16.7 tons of medicine and medical supplies.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.crowdrise.com/direct-relief-hurricane-matthew-relief/fundraiser/DirectRelief|title=Click here to support Direct Relief - Hurricane Matthew Relief by Direct Relief|website=CrowdRise|language=en|access-date=2019-06-21}}</ref>
