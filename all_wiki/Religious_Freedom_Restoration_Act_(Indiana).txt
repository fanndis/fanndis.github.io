Indiana's Attorney General [[Greg Zoeller]] has written [[Amicus curiae|amicus]] briefs supporting same-sex marriage bans in ''[[Hollingsworth v. Perry]]'' and ''[[United States v.

Indiana, unlike neighboring Illinois, does not have a state-wide anti-discrimination ordinance, and the majority of the state does not have local ordinances against discrimination against LGBT people. When a reporter asked [[Speaker of the Indiana House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] [[Brian Bosma]] whether it would be against the law for a business to put up a "no gays allowed" sign, he stated that "it would depend" on whether the business was in "a community that had a human rights ordinance."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2015/03/watch-indiana-gop-leader-admits-no-gays-allowed-sign-would-be-legal-in-most-of-the-state/|title=WATCH: Indiana GOP leader admits 'No Gays Allowed' sign would be legal in most of the state|work=The Raw Story|first=Eric|last=Dolan|date=March 30, 2015}}</ref><ref name="journalgazette">{{cite news|url=http://www.journalgazette.net/news/local/indiana/Leaders-intend-to-clarify-bill-5843366|title=Leaders intend to clarify bill – Say discrimination not intent|first=Niki|last=Kelly|newspaper=The Journal Gazette}}</ref>

In 1993, the [[Religious Freedom Restoration Act]] was passed by the U.S. Congress and signed into law by President [[Bill Clinton]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.volokh.com/2013/12/02/1a-religious-freedom-restoration-act/|title=1A. What Is the Religious Freedom Restoration Act?|work=The Volokh Conspiracy|accessdate=October 10, 2014}}</ref> Originally, the federal law was intended to apply to federal, state, and local governments.  In 1997, the U.S. Supreme Court in ''[[City of Boerne v. Flores]]'' held that the Religious Freedom Restoration Act only applies to the federal government, but not states and other local municipalities within them. As a result, 21 states passed [[State Religious Freedom Restoration Acts|state RFRAs]] before 2014.

In 2014, the United States Supreme Court handed down a landmark decision in ''[[Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc.]]'' recognizing a for-profit corporation's claim of religious belief. Nineteen members of Congress who signed the original RFRA stated in a submission to the Supreme Court that they "could not have anticipated, and did not intend, such a broad and unprecedented expansion of RFRA".<ref name="columbialaw">{{cite web|url=http://web.law.columbia.edu/sites/default/files/microsites/gender-sexuality/law_professors_letter_on_indiana_rfra.pdf|title=Re: Religious Freedom Restoration Act|date=February 27, 2015|publisher=Columbia School of law}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jacksonfreepress.com/news/2014/mar/19/hobby-lobby-wages-war-birth-control/|title=Hobby Lobby Wages War on Birth Control|date=March 19, 2014}}</ref> The members further stated that RFRA "extended free-exercise rights only to individuals and to religious, non-profit organizations. No Supreme Court precedent had extended free-exercise rights to secular, for-profit corporations." Following this decision, many states have proposed expanding state RFRA laws to include for-profit corporations,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/11/16/rfra-madness-what-s-next-for-anti-democratic-religious-exemptions.html|title=RFRA Madness: What's Next for Anti-Democratic 'Religious Exemptions'|work=The Daily Beast|date=November 16, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/03/27/indianas-religious-freedom-bill-and-the-ghost-of-hobby-lobby/|title=How Hobby Lobby paved the way for Indiana's 'religious freedom' bill|work=Washington Post|date=March 27, 2015|first=Terrence|last=McCoy}}</ref> including in Arizona where [[Arizona SB 1062|SB 1062]] was passed but was vetoed by Governor [[Jan Brewer]] in 2014.<ref name="Aljazeera"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2014/02/26/politics/arizona-brewer-bill/|title=Arizona Gov.

==Content==
As signed into law, Indiana SB 101 stipulates that "a governmental entity may not substantially burden a person's exercise of religion... [unless it] (1) is in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest; and (2) is the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling governmental interest." The bill defines a "person" to include any individual, organization, or "a partnership, a limited liability company, a corporation, a company, a firm, a society, a joint-stock company, an unincorporated association", or another entity driven by religious belief that can sue and be sued, "regardless of whether the entity is organized and operated for profit or nonprofit purposes."<ref name="politifactpence"/> A "person," as defined by the bill, would be permitted to cite violation of this law as a defense in legal proceedings. While the bill explicitly states that no government entity need be involved in the legal proceeding to invoke such a defense, it also states that "the governmental entity has an unconditional right to intervene in order to respond to the person's invocation of this chapter."

===Signing===
The bill was approved by a vote of 40–10. The Governor signed the approved bill into law three days later, and the law became effective on July 1, 2015.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/chi-indiana-religious-freedom-bill-sb101-pence-20150326-story.html |title=Indiana Gov.
