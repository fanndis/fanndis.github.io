'''''Loud''''' is the fifth [[studio album]] by Barbadian singer [[Rihanna]]. It was released on November 12, 2010, by [[Def Jam Recordings]] and SRP Records. The album was recorded between February and August 2010, during the singer's [[Last Girl on Earth]] tour and the filming of her first feature film ''[[Battleship (film)|Battleship]]'' (2012). Rihanna and [[L.A. Reid]] were the executive producers of ''Loud'' and worked with various record producers, including [[Stargate (record producers)|Stargate]], [[Sandy Vee]], [[The Runners (production duo)|The Runners]], [[Tricky Stewart]] and [[Alex da Kid]]. The album features several guest vocalists, including rappers [[Drake (rapper)|Drake]], [[Nicki Minaj]] and [[Eminem]], who is featured on the sequel to "[[Love the Way You Lie]]", titled "[[Love the Way You Lie (Part II)]]".

A [[dance-pop]] and [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] album, ''Loud'' differs from Rihanna's previous record, ''[[Rated R (Rihanna album)|Rated R]]'' (2009), which incorporates a prominently foreboding and angry tone and dark themes. ''Loud'' features [[up-tempo]] songs, and marks the return to [[dancehall]]; a genre prominent on her first two albums ''[[Music of the Sun]]'' (2005) and ''[[A Girl like Me (Rihanna album)|A Girl like Me]]'' (2006). It also uses [[Rock music|rock]] in "[[California King Bed]]" and [[reggae]] in the [[Caribbean]]-inspired "[[Man Down (song)|Man Down]]".

''Loud'' received generally positive reviews from music critics, who complimented its upbeat material and Rihanna's vocal performances, while others stated that although the songs were solid, they were unfocused to each other. The album was a commercial success; it debuted at number three on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart, with sales of 207,000 copies, the highest first-week sales of her career at the time. The album peaked at number one on the [[Canadian Albums Chart|Canadian]], [[Swiss Albums Chart|Swiss]] and the [[UK Albums Chart|UK]] album charts. According to the [[International Federation of the Phonographic Industry]] (IFPI), ''Loud'' was the eighth global best-selling album of 2011.<ref name="IFPI 1">{{cite web|url=http://www.snepmusique.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/RIN-2012-SNEP-copie.pdf|title=Global Music Report 2012|publisher=[[International Federation of the Phonographic Industry]]|accessdate=June 8, 2012|page=34|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140727140246/http://www.snepmusique.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/RIN-2012-SNEP-copie.pdf|archive-date=July 27, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> Since its release, it has sold over 8 million copies worldwide.

The album produced seven singles, including the international hits "[[Only Girl (In the World)]]", "[[What's My Name? (Rihanna song)|What's My Name?]]", and "[[S&M (song)|S&M]]". All three singles reached number one on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart. "S&M" was Rihanna's tenth number one song in the US, making Rihanna the youngest recording artist to accumulate the plateau in the shortest time, surpassing [[Mariah Carey]]. "Only Girl (In the World)" won the [[Grammy Award for Best Dance Recording]] in February 2011; additionally, the album was nominated for three more Grammy Awards, including for [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]]. To support the album, Rihanna embarked on her third worldwide concert tour, entitled the [[Loud Tour]].
