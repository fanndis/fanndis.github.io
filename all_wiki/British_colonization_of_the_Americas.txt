The British colonization of the Americas was the history of  establishment of control, settlement, and [[decolonization]] of the continents of the Americas by [[Kingdom of England|England]], [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]] and (after 1707) [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]]. Colonization efforts began in the 16th century with failed attempts by England to establish permanent colonies in North America. The first permanent British colony was established in [[Jamestown, Virginia]] in 1607. Over the next several centuries more colonies were established in North America, Central America, South America, and the Caribbean. Though most British colonies in the Americas eventually gained independence, some colonies have opted to remain under Britain's jurisdiction as [[British Overseas Territories]].

Evidence supports North America had been inhabited by [[Settlement_of_the_Americas|people who migrated]] across the North Atlantic ice shelf 18–20,000 years ago [[Solutrean hypothesis|from the area]] that is now France and Spain, and later from far East Russia/[[Siberia]] across the [[Bering Strait]] 12,500-13,500 years ago ( Northern Native Americans retain [[Genetic history of indigenous peoples of the Americas|mixed DNA profiles]] today).{{cn|date=October 2020}} The first documented Norse-European settlement (since excavated) was established along coastal Canada by [[Leif Erikson]] of Greenland in 1000 AD named [[Vinland]], lasting 3 years. Later European exploration of North America resumed with [[Christopher Columbus]]'s 1492 expedition sponsored by Spain. English exploration began almost a century later. Sir [[Walter Raleigh]] established the short-lived [[Roanoke Colony]] in 1585. The 1607 settlement of the [[Jamestown colony]] grew into the [[Colony of Virginia]] and ''Virgineola'' (settled unintentionally by the shipwreck of the Virginia Company's [[Sea Venture]] in 1609) quickly renamed ''The Somers Isles'' (though the older Spanish name of [[Bermuda]] has resisted replacement). In 1620, a group of [[Puritans]] established a second permanent colony on the coast of Massachusetts. Several other English colonies were established in North America during the 17th and 18th centuries. With the authorization of a royal charter, the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] established the territory of [[Rupert's Land]] in the [[Hudson Bay drainage basin]]. The English also established or conquered several colonies in the [[Caribbean]], including [[Barbados]] and [[Jamaica]].

England captured the Dutch colony of [[New Netherland]] in the [[Anglo-Dutch Wars]] of the mid-17th century, leaving North America divided amongst the English, [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]], and [[French colonial empire|French empires]]. After decades of warring with France, Britain took control of the [[Canada (New France)|French colony of Canada]], as well as several Caribbean territories, in 1763. With the assistance of France and Spain, many of the North American colonies gained independence from Britain through victory in the [[American Revolutionary War]], which ended in 1783. Historians refer to the British Empire after 1783 as the "Second British Empire"; this period saw Britain increasingly focus on Asia and Africa instead of the Americas, and increasingly focus on the expansion of trade rather than territorial possessions. Nonetheless, Britain continued to colonize parts of the Americas in the 19th century, taking control of [[British Columbia]] and establishing the colonies of the [[Falkland Islands]] and [[British Honduras]]. Britain also gained control of several colonies, including [[Trinidad]] and [[British Guiana]], following the 1815 defeat of France in the [[Napoleonic Wars]].

In the mid-19th century, Britain began the process of granting self-government to its remaining colonies in North America. Most of these colonies joined the Confederation of [[Canada]] in the 1860s or 1870s, though [[Newfoundland]] would not join Canada until 1949. Canada gained full autonomy following the passage of the [[Statute of Westminster 1931]], though it retained various ties to Britain and still recognizes the British monarch as [[head of state]]. Following the onset of the [[Cold War]], most of the remaining British colonies in the Americas gained independence between 1962 and 1983. Many of the former British colonies are part of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], a political association chiefly consisting of former colonies of the British Empire.

==Background: early exploration and colonization of the Americas==
{{Further|Pre-Columbian era|Age of Discovery|European colonization of the Americas}}
[[File:Spanish Empire in 1598.png|thumb|upright=1.0|By the end of the 16th century, the [[Iberian Union]] of [[Spain]] and [[Portugal]] had colonized much of the [[Americas]], but other parts of the Americas had not yet been colonized by European powers]]

Following the first voyage of [[Christopher Columbus]] in 1492, [[Spain]] and [[Portugal]] established colonies in the [[New World]], beginning the [[European colonization of the Americas]].<ref>Richter (2011), pp. 69-70</ref> [[France]] and [[England]], the two other major powers of 15th-century [[Western Europe]], employed explorers soon after the return of Columbus's first voyage. In 1497, King [[Henry VII of England]] dispatched an expedition led by [[John Cabot]] to explore the coast of North America, but the lack of precious metals or other riches discouraged both the Spanish and English from permanently settling in North America during the early 16th century.<ref>Richter (2011), pp. 83-85</ref> Later explorers such as [[Martin Frobisher]] and [[Henry Hudson]] sailed to the New World in search of a [[Northwest Passage]] between the Atlantic Ocean and Asia, but were unable to find a viable route.<ref>Richter (2011), pp. 121-123</ref> Europeans established [[Cod fishing in Newfoundland|fisheries]] in the [[Grand Banks of Newfoundland]], and traded metal, glass, and cloth for food and fur, beginning the [[North American fur trade]].<ref>Richter (2011), pp. 129-130</ref> During mid-1585 [[Bernard Drake]] launched an [[Newfoundland expedition (1585)|expedition to Newfoundland]] which crippled the Spanish and Portuguese fishing fleets there from which they never recovered. This would have consequences in terms of English colonial expansion and settlement.{{cn|date=April 2020}} Meanwhile, in the [[Caribbean Sea]], English sailors defied Spanish trade restrictions and preyed on [[Spanish treasure fleet|Spanish treasure ships]].<ref>James (1997), pp. 16–17</ref>

In the late sixteenth century, [[Protestant]] England became embroiled in a [[Anglo-Spanish War (1585–1604)|religious war]] with [[Catholicism|Catholic]] Spain. Seeking to weaken Spain's economic and military power, English [[privateer]]s such as [[Francis Drake]] and [[Humphrey Gilbert]] harassed Spanish shipping.<ref>Richter (2011), pp. 98-100</ref> Gilbert proposed the colonization of North America on the Spanish model, with the goal of creating a profitable English empire that could also serve as a base for the privateers. After Gilbert's death, [[Walter Raleigh]] took up the cause of North American colonization, sponsoring an expedition of 500 men to [[Roanoke Island]]. In 1584, the colonists established the first permanent English colony in North America,<ref>Richter (2011), pp. 100-102</ref> but the colonists were poorly prepared for life in the New World, and by 1590, the colonists had disappeared. There are a variety of theories as to what happened to the colonists there. The most popular theory is that the colonists left in search of a new area to settle in the Chesapeake, leaving stragglers to integrate with local Native American tribes. <ref>Richter (2011), pp. 103-107</ref> A separate colonization attempt in [[Newfoundland]] also failed.<ref>James (1997), p. 5</ref> Despite the failure of these early colonies, the English remained interested in the colonization of North America for economic and military reasons.<ref>Richter (2011), p. 112</ref>

==Early colonization, 1607–1630==

[[File:James I of England 404446.jpg|thumb|Jamestown, the first permanent English settlement in North America, was established during the reign of King [[James VI and I|James I of England]]]]

In 1606, King [[James VI and I|James I of England]] granted charters to both the [[Plymouth Company]] and the [[London Company]] for the purpose of establishing permanent settlements in North America. In 1607, the London Company established a permanent colony at [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]] on the [[Chesapeake Bay]], but the Plymouth Company's [[Popham Colony]] proved short-lived. The colonists at Jamestown faced extreme adversity, and by 1617 there were only 351 survivors out of the 1700 colonists who had been transported to Jamestown.<ref>Richter (2011), pp. 113-115</ref> After the Virginians discovered the profitability of growing [[tobacco]], the settlement's population boomed from 400 settlers in 1617 to 1240 settlers in 1622. The London Company was bankrupted in part due to frequent warring with nearby American Indians, leading the English crown to take direct control of the [[Colony of Virginia]], as Jamestown and its surrounding environs became known.<ref>Richter (2011), pp. 116-117</ref>

In 1609, the [[Sea Venture]], flagship of the English [[London Company|London Company, better known as the Virginia Company]], bearing Admiral Sir [[George Somers]] and the new Lieutenant-Governor for Jamestown, Sir [[Thomas Gates (governor)|Thomas Gates]],  was deliberately driven onto the reef off the archipelago of [[Bermuda]] to prevent its foundering during a hurricane on the of 25 July. The 150 passengers and crew crew built two new ships, the ''Deliverance'' and ''Patience'' and most departed Bermuda again for Jamestown on 11 May, 1610. Two men remained behind, and were joined by a third after the Patience returned again, then departed for England (it had been meant to return to Jamestown after gathering more food in Bermuda), ensuring that Bermuda remained settled, and in the possession of England and the London Company from 1609 to 1612, when more settlers and the first [[Governor of Bermuda|Lieutenant-Governor]] arrived from England following the extension of the Royal Charter of the London Company to officially add Bermuda to the territory of Virginia.

The archipelago was officially named ''Virgineola'', though this was soon changed to ''The Somers Isles'', which remains an official name though the archipelago had already long been infamous as ''Bermuda'', and the older Spanish name has resisted replacement. The Lieutenant-Governor and settlers who arrived in 1612 briefly settled on Smith's Island, where the three left behind by the Sea Venture were thriving, before moving to [[St. George's Island, Bermuda|St. George's Island]] where they established the town of ''New London'', which was soon renamed to [[St. George's, Bermuda|St. George's Town]] (the first actual town successfully established by the English in the New World as Jamestown was really ''James Fort'', a rudimentary defensive structure, in 1612).<ref>{{cite web |title=Bermuda - History and Heritage |url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/travel/bermuda-history-and-heritage-14340790/ |website=Smithsonian.com |accessdate=6 September 2019}}</ref>

Bermuda was soon more populous, self-sufficient and prosperous than Jamestown and a second company, the ''Company of the City of London for the Plantacion of The Somers Isles'' (better known as The [[Somers Isles Company]]) was spun-off from the London Company in 1615, and continued to administer Bermuda after the London Company's Royal Charter was revoked in 1624 (The Somers Isles Company's Royal Charter was similarly revoked in 1684). Bermuda pioneered tobacco cultivation as the engine for its economic growth, but as Virginia's tobacco agriculture outstripped it in the 1620s, and new colonies in the West Indies also emulated its tobacco industry, the price of Bermudian tobacco fell and the colony became unprofitable for many of the company's shareholders, who mostly had remained in England while managers or tenants farmed their land in Bermuda with the labour of indentured servants. Bermuda's [[House of Assembly of Bermuda|House of Assembly]] held its first session in 1620 (Virginia's [[House of Burgesses]] having held its first session in 1619), but with no landowners resident in Bermuda there was consequently no [[property qualification]], unlike the case with the [[House of Commons]].

As the bottom fell out of tobacco, many absentee shareholders (or ''Adventurers'') sold their shares to the occupying managers or tenants, with the agricultural industry quickly shifting towards family farms that grew subsistence crops instead of tobacco. Bermudians soon found they could sell their excess foodstuffs in the West Indies where colonies like Barbados grew tobacco to the exclusion of subsistence crops. As the company's magazine ship would not carry their food exports to the West Indies, Bermudians began to build their own ships from [[Bermuda cedar]], developing the speedy and nimble [[Bermuda sloop]] and the [[Bermuda rig]].

Between the late 1610s and the American Revolution, the British shipped an estimated 50,000 to 120,000 convicts to their American colonies.<ref>James Davie Butler, "British Convicts Shipped to American Colonies," ''American Historical Review'' (1896) 2#1 pp. 12–33 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1833611 in JSTOR]; Thomas Keneally, ''The Commonwealth of Thieves'', Random House Publishing, Sydney, 2005.</ref>

Meanwhile, the [[Plymouth Council for New England]] sponsored several colonization projects, including a colony established by a group of English [[Puritans]], known today as the [[Pilgrims (Plymouth Colony)|Pilgrims]].<ref>Richter (2011), pp. 152-153</ref> The Puritans embraced an intensely emotional form of [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] Protestantism and sought independence from the [[Church of England]].<ref>Richter (2011), pp. 178-179</ref> In 1620, the ''[[Mayflower]]'' transported the Pilgrims across the Atlantic, and the Pilgrims established [[Plymouth Colony]] in [[Cape Cod]]. The Pilgrims endured an extremely hard first winter, with roughly fifty of the one hundred colonists dying. In 1621, Plymouth Colony was able to establish an alliance with the nearby [[Wampanoag]] tribe, which helped the Plymouth Colony adopt effective agricultural practices and engaged in the trade of fur and other materials.<ref>Richter (2011), pp. 153-157</ref> Farther north, the English also established [[Newfoundland Colony]] in 1610, which primarily focused on [[cod]] fishing.<ref>James (1997), pp. 7–8</ref>

The [[Caribbean]] would provide some of England's most important and lucrative colonies,<ref name="james17"/> but not before several attempts at colonization failed. An attempt to establish a colony in [[British Guiana|Guiana]] in 1604 lasted only two years and failed in its main objective to find gold deposits.<ref>Canny (1998), p. 71</ref> Colonies in [[Saint Lucia|St Lucia]]&nbsp;(1605) and [[Grenada]]&nbsp;(1609) also rapidly folded.<ref>Canny (1998), p. 221</ref> Encouraged by the success of Virginia, in 1627 King [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] granted a charter to the Barbados Company for the settlement of the uninhabited Caribbean island of [[Barbados]].

===West Indies colonies===
{{Further|History of the British West Indies}}

The success of colonization efforts in Barbados encouraged the establishment of more Caribbean colonies, and by 1660 England had established Caribbean sugar colonies in [[St. Kitts]], [[Antigua]], [[Nevis]], and [[Montserrat]],<ref name="james17"/> English colonization of [[the Bahamas]] began in 1648 after a Puritan group known as the [[Eleutheran Adventurers]] established a colony on the island of [[Eleuthera]].{{citation needed|date=September 2019}} England established another sugar colony in 1655 following the successful [[invasion of Jamaica]] during the [[Anglo-Spanish War (1654–1660)|Anglo-Spanish War]].<ref>James (1997), pp. 30–31</ref> Spain acknowledged English possession of Jamaica and the [[Caiman Islands]] in the 1670 [[Treaty of Madrid (1670)|Treaty of Madrid]].{{citation needed|date=September 2019}} England captured [[Tortola]] from the Dutch in 1670, and subsequently took possession of the nearby islands of [[Anegada]] and [[Virgin Gorda]]; these islands would later form the [[British Virgin Islands]].{{citation needed|date=September 2019}} During the 17th century, the sugar colonies adopted the system of [[Plantation|sugar plantations]] successfully used by the Portuguese in [[Colonial Brazil|Brazil]], which depended on slave labour.<ref>Lloyd (1996), pp.&nbsp;22–23.</ref> Until the abolition of its slave trade in 1807, Britain was responsible for the transportation of 3.5&nbsp;million African slaves to the Americas, a third of all [[Atlantic slave trade|slaves transported across the Atlantic]].<ref>Ferguson (2004), p. 62</ref> Many of the slaves were captured by the [[Royal African Company]] in [[West Africa]], though others came from [[Madagascar]].<ref>James (1997), p. 24</ref> These slaves soon came to form the majority of the population in Caribbean colonies like Barbados and Jamaica, where strict [[slave codes]] were established partly to deter [[slave rebellion]]s.<ref>James (1997), pp. 42–43</ref>

===Establishment of the Thirteen Colonies===
{{Further|Colonial history of the United States}}

====New England Colonies====

Following the success of the Jamestown and Plymouth Colonies, several more English groups established colonies in the region that became known as [[New England]]. In 1629, another group of Puritans led by [[John Winthrop]] established the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]], and by 1635 roughly ten thousand English settlers lived in the region between the [[Connecticut River]] and the [[Kennebec River]].<ref>Richter (2011), pp. 157-159</ref> After defeating the [[Pequot]] in the [[Pequot War]], Puritan settlers established the [[Connecticut Colony]] in the region the Pequots had formerly controlled.<ref>Richter (2011), pp. 161-167</ref> The [[Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations]] was founded by [[Roger Williams]], a Puritan leader who was expelled from the Massachusetts Bay Colony after he advocated for a formal split with the [[Church of England]].<ref>Richter (2011), pp. 196-197</ref> As New England was a relatively cold and infertile region, the [[New England Colonies]] relied on fishing and long-distance trade to sustain the economy.<ref name="Taylor 2016, p. 19">Taylor (2016), p. 19</ref>

A "History of New England" would not be complete without discussing [[John Hull (merchant)|John Hull]], [[the pine tree shilling]], his central role in the establishment of the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] and the [[Old South Church]]. In 1652 the [[Massachusetts legislature]] authorized [[John Hull (merchant)|John Hull]] to produce coinage ([[Moneyer|mintmaster]]). "The Hull Mint produced several denominations of silver coinage, including the pine tree shilling, for over 30 years until the political and economic situation made operating the mint no longer practical." Mostly political for [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] deemed the "Hull Mint" [[high treason in the United Kingdom]] which had a punishment of [[Hanging, drawing and quartering]]. "On April 6, 1681, [[Edward Randolph (colonial administrator)]] petitioned the king, informing him the colony was still pressing their own coins which he saw as high treason and believed it was enough to void the charter. He asked that a writ of Quo warranto (a legal action requiring the defendant to show what authority they have for exercising some right, power, or franchise they claim to hold) be issued against [[Massachusetts]] for the violations."<ref>https://historyofmassachusetts.org/massachusetts-bay-colony-charter-revoked
</ref>

====Southern Colonies====

In 1632, [[Cecil Calvert, 2nd Baron Baltimore]] founded the [[Province of Maryland]] to the north of Virginia.<ref>Richter (2011), pp. 262-263</ref> Maryland and Virginia became known as the [[Chesapeake Colonies]], and experienced similar immigration and economic activities.<ref>Richter (2011), pp. 203-204</ref> Though Baltimore and his descendants intended for the colony to be a refuge for Catholics, it attracted mostly Protestant immigrants, many of whom scorned the Calvert family's policy of religious toleration.<ref>Richter (2011), pp. 303-304</ref> In the mid-17th century, the Chesapeake Colonies, inspired by the success of slavery in Barbados, began the mass [[History of slavery in Virginia|importation of African slaves]]. Though many early slaves eventually gained their freedom, after 1662 Virginia adopted policies that passed [[Partus sequitur ventrem|enslaved status from mother to child]] and granted slave owners near-total domination of their human property.<ref>Richter (2011), p. 272</ref>

640 miles East-South-East of [[Cape Hatteras]], in the Virginia Company's other former settlement, the Somers Isles, alias the Islands of Bermuda, where the spin-off Somers Isles Company still administered, the company and its shareholders in England only earned profits from the export of tobacco, placing them increasingly at odds with Bermudians for whom tobacco had become unprofitable to cultivate. As only those landowners who could attend the company's annual meetings in England were permitted to vote on company policy, the company worked to suppress the developing maritime economy of the colonists and to force the production of tobacco, which required unsustainable farming practices as more was required to be produced to make up for the diminished value.

As many of the class of moneyed businessmen who were adventurers in the company were aligned to the Parliamentary cause during the [[English Civil War]], Bermuda was one of the [[English overseas possessions in the Wars of the Three Kingdoms|colonies that sided with the Crown during the war]], being the first to recognise [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] after the execution of his father. With control of their Assembly and the militia and volunteer [[coastal artillery]], the Royalist majority deposed the company-appointed Governor (by the 1630s, the company had ceased sending Governors to Bermuda and had instead appointed a succession of prominent Bermudians to the role, including religious Independent and Parliamentarian [[William Sayle]]) by force of arms and elected John Trimingham to replace him. Many of Bermuda's religious Independents, who had sided with Parliament, were forced into exile.  Although some of the newer continental colonies settled largely by anti-episcopalian Protestants sided with Parliament during the war, Virginia and other colonies like Bermuda supported the Crown and were subjected to the measures laid out in [[An Act for prohibiting Trade with the Barbadoes, Virginia, Bermuda and Antego]] until Parliament was able to force them to acknowledge its sovereignty.

Bermudian anger at the policies of the Somers Isles Company ultimately saw them take their complaints to the Crown after [[The Restoration]], leading to the Crown revoking the Royal Charter of the Somers Isles Company and taking over direct administration of Bermuda in 1684. From that date, Bermudians abandoned agriculture, diversifying their maritime industry to occupy many niches of inter-colonial trade between North America and the West Indies. Bermudians limited landmass and high birth rate meant that a steady outflow from the colony contributed about 10,000 settlers to other colonies, notably the southern continental colonies (including [[Carolina Province]], which was settled from Bermuda in 1670), as well as West Indian settlements, including the [[Providence Island colony]] in 1631, the [[Bahamas]] (settled by [[Eleutheran Adventurers]], Parliament-allied Civil War exiles from Bermuda, under William Sayle in the 1640s), and the seasonal occupation of the [[Turks and Caicos Islands|Turks Islands]] from 1681.

Encouraged by the apparent weakness of Spanish rule in [[Spanish Florida|Florida]], Barbadian planter [[John Colleton]] and seven other supporters of [[Charles II of England]] established the [[Province of Carolina]] in 1663.<ref>Richter (2011), pp. 236-238</ref> Settlers in the Carolina Colony established two main population centers, with many Virginians settling in the north of the province and many English Barbadians settling in the southern port city of [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charles Town]].<ref>Richter (2011), p. 319</ref> In 1729, following the [[Yamasee War]], Carolina was divided into the crown colonies of [[Province of North Carolina|North Carolina]] and [[Province of South Carolina|South Carolina]].<ref>Richter (2011), pp. 323-324</ref> The colonies of Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, and South Carolina (as well as the [[Province of Georgia]], which was established in 1732) became known as the [[Southern Colonies]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=The Southern Colonies [ushistory.org]|url=https://www.ushistory.org/us/5.asp|access-date=2020-09-15|website=www.ushistory.org}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Settling the Southern Colonies {{!}} Boundless US History|url=https://courses.lumenlearning.com/boundless-ushistory/chapter/settling-the-southern-colonies/|access-date=2020-09-15|website=courses.lumenlearning.com}}</ref>

====Middle Colonies====

[[File:James II (1685).jpg|thumb|[[James II of England|James II]] established the [[Colony of New York]] and the [[Dominion of New England]]. He succeeded his brother as King of England in 1685 but was overthrown in the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688]]

Beginning in 1609, Dutch traders had established fur trading posts on the [[Hudson River]], [[Delaware River]], and [[Connecticut River]], ultimately creating the Dutch colony of [[New Netherland]], with a capital at [[New Amsterdam]].<ref>Richter (2011), pp. 138-140</ref> In 1657, New Netherland expanded through conquest of [[New Sweden]], a [[Sweden|Swedish]] colony centered in the [[Delaware Valley]].<ref>Richter (2011), p. 262</ref> Despite commercial success, New Netherland failed to attract the same level of settlement as the English colonies.<ref>Richter (2011), pp. 215-217</ref> In 1664, during a [[Anglo-Dutch Wars|series of wars]] between the English and Dutch, English soldier [[Richard Nicolls]] captured New Netherland.<ref>Richter (2011), pp. 248-249</ref> The Dutch briefly regained control of parts of New Netherland in the [[Third Anglo-Dutch War]], but surrendered its claim to the territory in the 1674 [[Treaty of Westminster (1674)|Treaty of Westminster]], ending the Dutch colonial presence in North America.<ref>Richter (2011), p. 261</ref> In 1664, the [[Duke of York]], later known as [[James II of England]], was granted control of the English colonies north of the Delaware River.

Charles II rewarded [[William Penn]], the son of distinguished [[William Penn (Royal Navy officer)|Admiral William Penn]], with the land situated between Maryland and the Jerseys. Penn named this land the [[Province of Pennsylvania]].<ref>Richter (2011), p. 373</ref> Penn was also granted a lease to the [[Delaware Colony]], which gained its own legislature in 1701.<ref name="richter251"/> A devout [[Quaker]], Penn sought to create a haven of [[religious toleration]] in the New World.<ref name="richter251">Richter (2011), p. 251</ref> Pennsylvania attracted Quakers and other settlers from across Europe, and the city of [[Philadelphia]] quickly emerged as a thriving port city.<ref>Richter (2011), pp. 357</ref> With its fertile and cheap land, Pennsylvania became one of the most attractive destinations for immigrants in the late 17th century.<ref>Richter (2011), pp. 358</ref> New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Delaware became known as the [[Middle Colonies]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Economy of British America, 1607-1789|last1=McCusker|first1=John J.|last2=Menard|first2=Russell R.|date=1991|publisher=University of North Carolina Press|doi=10.5149/9781469600000_mccusker.16|jstor=10.5149/9781469600000_mccusker|doi-broken-date=11 November 2020}}</ref>

===Hudson's Bay Company===

In 1670, [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] incorporated by [[royal charter]] the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] (HBC), granting it a monopoly on the [[North American fur trade|fur trade]] in the area known as [[Rupert's Land]]. Forts and trading posts established by the HBC were frequently the subject of attacks by the French.<ref>Bucker (2008), p. 25</ref>

===Darien scheme===
In 1695, the [[Parliament of Scotland]] granted a charter to the [[Company of Scotland]], which established a settlement in 1698 on the [[Isthmus of Panama]]. Besieged by neighbouring Spanish colonists of [[New Kingdom of Granada|New Granada]], and afflicted by [[malaria]], the colony was abandoned two years later. The [[Darien scheme]] was a financial disaster for Scotland—a quarter of Scottish capital<ref>Magnusson (2003), p. 531</ref> was lost in the enterprise—and ended Scottish hopes of establishing its own overseas empire. The episode also had major political consequences, persuading the governments of both England and Scotland of the merits of a union of countries, rather than just crowns.<ref>Macaulay (1848), p. 509</ref> This occurred in 1707 with the [[Treaty of Union]], establishing the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]].

===Settlement and expansion in North America===

[[File:North America 1748.PNG|thumb|right|upright=1.0|The Thirteen Colonies and neighboring polities in 1748]]

After succeeding his brother in 1685, King James II and his lieutenant, [[Edmund Andros]], sought to assert the crown's authority over colonial affairs.<ref>Richter (2011), pp. 290-294</ref> James was deposed by the new joint monarchy of [[William III of England|William]] and [[Mary II of England|Mary]] in the [[Glorious Revolution]],<ref>Richter (2011), pp. 300-301</ref> but William and Mary quickly reinstated many of the James's colonial policies, including the [[Mercantilism|mercantilist]] Navigation Acts and the [[Board of Trade]].<ref>Richter (2011), pp. 310-311, 328</ref> The Massachusetts Bay Colony, Plymouth Colony and the [[Province of Maine]] were incorporated into the [[Province of Massachusetts Bay]], and New York and the Massachusetts Bay Colony were reorganized as royal colonies, with a governor appointed by the king.<ref>Richter (2011), pp. 314-315</ref> Maryland, which had experienced a [[Protestant Revolution (Maryland)|revolution]] against the Calvert family, also became a royal colony, though the Calverts retained much of their land and revenue in the colony.<ref>Richter (2011), p. 315</ref> Even those colonies that retained their charters or proprietors were forced to assent to much greater royal control than had existed before the 1690s.<ref>Richter (2011), pp. 315-316</ref>

Between immigration, the importation of slaves, and natural population growth, the colonial population in [[British North America]] grew immensely in the 18th century. According to historian Alan Taylor, the population of the [[Thirteen Colonies]] (the British North American colonies which would eventually form the United States) stood at 1.5 million in 1750.<ref>Taylor (2016), p. 20</ref> More than ninety percent of the colonists lived as farmers, though cities like Philadelphia, New York, and [[Boston]] flourished.<ref>Taylor (2016), p. 23</ref> With the defeat of the Dutch and the imposition of the Navigation Acts, the British colonies in North America became part of the global British trading network. The colonists traded foodstuffs, wood, tobacco, and various other resources for Asian tea, West Indian coffee, and West Indian sugar, among other items.<ref>Richter (2011), pp. 329-330</ref> Native Americans far from the Atlantic coast supplied the Atlantic market with beaver fur and deerskins, and sought to preserve their independence by maintaining a balance of power between the French and English.<ref>Richter (2011), pp. 332-336</ref> By 1770, the economic output of the Thirteen Colonies made up forty percent of the [[gross domestic product]] of the British Empire.<ref>Taylor (2016), p. 25</ref>

Prior to 1660, almost all immigrants to the English colonies of North America had migrated freely, though most paid for their passage by becoming [[indentured servant]]s.<ref>James (1997), pp. 10–11</ref> Improved economic conditions and an easing of religious persecution in Europe made it increasingly difficult to recruit labor to the colonies in the 17th and 18th centuries. Partly due to this shortage of free labor, the population of slaves in British North America grew dramatically between 1680 and 1750; the growth was driven by a mixture of forced immigration and the reproduction of slaves.<ref>Richter (2011), pp. 346-347</ref> In the Southern Colonies, which relied most heavily on slave labor, the slaves supported vast plantation economies lorded over by increasingly wealthy elites.<ref>Richter (2011), pp. 346–347, 351-352</ref> By 1775, slaves made up one-fifth of the population of the Thirteen Colonies but less than ten percent of the population of the Middle Colonies and New England Colonies.<ref>Taylor (2016), p. 21</ref> Though a smaller proportion of the English population migrated to British North America after 1700, the colonies attracted new immigrants from other European countries,<ref>Taylor (2016), pp. 18-19</ref> including Catholic settlers from [[Ireland]]<ref>Richter (2011), pp. 360</ref> and Protestant Germans.<ref>Richter (2011), pp. 362</ref> As the 18th century progressed, colonists began to settle far from the Atlantic coast. Pennsylvania, Virginia, Connecticut, and Maryland all lay claim to the land in the [[Ohio River]] valley, and the colonies engaged in a scramble to expand west.<ref>Richter (2011), pp. 373-374</ref>

Following the 1684 revocation of the Somers Isles Company's Royal Charter, seafaring Bermudianses established an inter-colonial trade network, with [[Charleston, South Carolina]] (settled from Bermuda in 1670 under William Sayle, and on the same latitude as Bermuda, although Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, is the nearest landfall to Bermuda) forming a continental hub for their trade (Bermuda itself produced only ships and seamen).<ref>Jarvis, Michael (2010).

The Glorious Revolution and the succession of William III, who had long resisted French hegemony as the [[Stadtholder]] of the [[Dutch Republic]], ensured that England and its colonies would come into conflict with the [[French colonial empire|French empire]] of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] after 1689.<ref>Richter (2011), pp. 296-298</ref> Under the leadership of [[Samuel de Champlain]], the French had established [[Quebec City]] on the St Lawrence River in 1608, and it became the center of French colony of [[Canada (New France)|Canada]].<ref>Richter (2011), pp. 130-135</ref> France and England engaged in a proxy war via Native American allies during and after the [[Nine Years' War]], while the powerful [[Iroquois]] declared their neutrality.<ref>Richter (2011), pp. 317-318</ref> War between France and England continued in [[Queen Anne's War]], the North American component of the larger [[War of the Spanish Succession]]. In the 1713 [[Treaty of Utrecht]], which ended the War of Spanish Succession, the British won possession of the French territories of [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] and [[Acadia]], the latter of which was renamed [[Nova Scotia]].<ref name="Taylor 2016, p. 19"/> In the 1730s, [[James Oglethorpe]] proposed that the area south of the Carolinas be colonized to provide a buffer against Spanish Florida, and he was part of a group of trustees that were granted temporary proprietorship over the [[Province of Georgia]]. Oglethorpe and his compatriots hoped to establish a utopian colony that banned slavery, but by 1750 the colony remained sparsely populated, and Georgia became a crown colony in 1752.<ref>Richter (2011), pp. 358-359</ref>

In 1754, the Ohio Company started to build a fort at the confluence of the [[Allegheny River]] and the [[Monongahela River]]. A larger French force initially chased the Virginians away, but was forced to retreat after the [[Battle of Jumonville Glen]].<ref>Richter (2011), pp. 385-387</ref> After reports of the battle reached the French and British capitals, the [[Seven Years' War]] broke out in 1756; the North American component of this war is known as the [[French and Indian War]].<ref>Richter (2011), pp. 388-389</ref> After the [[Thomas Pelham-Holles, 1st Duke of Newcastle|Duke of Newcastle]] returned to power as Prime Minister in 1757, he and his foreign minister, [[William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham|William Pitt]], devoted unprecedented financial resources to the transoceanic conflict.<ref>Taylor (2016), p. 45</ref> The British won a series of victories after 1758, [[Conquest of 1760|conquering]] much of New France by the end of 1760.

==The Americans break away, 1763–1783==
{{Further|American Revolution|American Revolutionary War}}
[[File:Non-Native Nations Claim over NAFTA countries 1783.png|right|thumb|upright=1.0|North America after the 1783 Treaty of Paris]]

The British subjects of North America believed the [[Constitution of the United Kingdom|unwritten British constitution]] protected their rights and that the governmental system, with the [[House of Commons of Great Britain|House of Commons]], the [[House of Lords]], and the monarch sharing power found an ideal balance among democracy, oligarchy, and tyranny.<ref>Taylor (2016), pp. 31-35</ref> However, the British were saddled with huge debts following the French and Indian War. As much of the British debt had been generated by the defense of the colonies, British leaders felt that the colonies should contribute more funds, and they began imposing taxes such as the [[Sugar Act]] of 1764.<ref>Taylor (2016), pp. 51-53, 94–96</ref> Increased British control of the Thirteen Colonies upset the colonists and upended the notion many colonists held: that they were equal partners in the British Empire.<ref>Taylor (2016), pp. 51-52</ref> Meanwhile, seeking to avoid another expensive war with Native Americans, Britain issued the [[Royal Proclamation of 1763]], which restricted settlement west of the [[Appalachian Mountains]]. However it was effectively replaced five years later thanks to the [[Treaty of Fort Stanwix]].<ref>Taylor (2016), pp. 60-61</ref> The Thirteen Colonies became increasingly divided between [[Patriot (American Revolution)|Patriots]] opposed to Parliamentary taxation without representation, [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalists]] who supported the king. In the British colonies nearest to the Thirteen Colonies, however, protests were muted, as most colonists accepted the new taxes. These provinces had smaller populations, were largely dependent on the British military, and had less of a tradition of self-rule.<ref>Taylor (2016), pp. 102-103, 137-138.</ref>

At the [[Battles of Lexington and Concord]] in April 1775, the Patriots repulsed a British force charged with seizing militia arsenals.<ref>Taylor (2016), pp. 132-133</ref> The [[Second Continental Congress]] assembled in May 1775 and sought to coordinate armed resistance to Britain. It established an impromptu government that recruited soldiers and printed its own money.  Announcing a permanent break with Britain, the delegates adopted a [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] on 4 July 1776 for the United States of America.<ref>Taylor (2016), pp. pp. 139-141, 160-161</ref> The French formed a military alliance with the United States in 1778 following the British defeat at the [[Battle of Saratoga]]. Spain joined France in order to regain Gibraltar from Britain.<ref>Taylor (2016), pp. 187-191</ref> A combined Franco-American operation trapped a British invasion army at [[Yorktown, Virginia]], forcing them to surrender in October 1781.<ref>Taylor (2016), pp. 293-295</ref> The surrender shocked Britain. The king wanted to keep fighting but he lost control of Parliament and peace negotiations began.<ref>Taylor (2016), pp. 295-297</ref> In the 1783 [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]], Britain ceded all of its North American territory south of the [[Great Lakes]], except for the two Florida colonies, which were ceded to Spain.<ref>Taylor (2016), pp. 306-308</ref>

With their close ties of blood and trade with the continental colonies, especially Virginia and South Carolina, Bermudians leaned towards the rebels during the [[American War of Independence]], supplying them with privateering ships and gunpowder, but the power of the [[Royal Navy]] on the surrounding Atlantic left no possibility of their joining the rebellion, and they eventually availed themselves of the opportunities of [[Privateer#Bermudians|privateering]] against their former kinsmen. Although often mistaken for being in the West Indies, Bermuda is nearer to Canada (and was initially grouped within [[British North America]], retaining close links especially with the Nova Scotia and Newfoundland until the continental colonies were confederated into [[Canada]]) than to the West Indies, and the nearest landfall is North Carolina. Following the independence of the United States, this would make Bermuda of supreme importance to Britain's strategic control of the region, including its ability to protect its shipping in the area and its ability to project its power against the Atlantic seaboard of the United States, as was to be shown during the [[American War of 1812]].

Having defeated a combined Franco-Spanish naval force at the decisive 1782 [[Battle of the Saintes]], Britain retained control of Gibraltar and all its pre-war Caribbean possessions except for Tobago.<ref>James (1997), pp. 80–82</ref> Economically the new nation became a major trading partner of Britain.

==Second British Empire, 1783–1945==
[[File:British Empire 1921.png|thumb|upright=1.9|The British Empire in 1921]]
{{see also|New Imperialism}}

The loss of a large portion of [[British America]] defined the transition between the "first" and "second" empires, in which Britain shifted its attention away from the Americas to Asia, the Pacific, and later Africa.<ref name="canny92">Canny (1998), p. 92</ref> Influenced by the ideas of [[Adam Smith]], Britain also shifted away from mercantile ideals and began to prioritize the expansion of trade rather than territorial possessions.<ref name="james119165">James (1997), pp. 119–121, 165</ref> During the nineteenth century, some observers described Britain as having an "unofficial" empire based on the export of goods and financial investments around the world, including the newly independent republics of Latin America. Though this unofficial empire did not require direct British political control, it often involved the use of [[gunboat diplomacy]] and military intervention to protect British investments and ensure the free flow of trade.<ref>James (1997), pp. 173–174, 177</ref>

From 1793 to 1815, Britain was almost constantly at war, first in the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] and then in the [[Napoleonic Wars]].<ref>James (1997), p. 151</ref> During the wars, Britain took control of many French, Spanish, and Dutch Caribbean colonies.<ref>James (1997), p. 154</ref> Tensions between Britain and the United States escalated during the Napoleonic Wars, as the United States took advantage of its neutrality to undercut the British embargo on French-controlled ports, and Britain tried to cut off that American trade with France. The Royal Navy, which was desperately short of trained seamen and constantly losing deserters who sought better-paid work under less draconian discipline aboard American merchant vessels, boarded American ships to search for deserters, sometimes resulting in the [[Impressment]] of American sailors into the Royal Navy. The United States, at the same time, coveted the acquisition of Canada, which Britain could ill afford to lose as its naval and merchant fleets had been constructed largely from American timber before United States independence, and from Canadian timber thereafter. Taking advantage of Britain's absorption in its war with France, the United States began the [[American War of 1812]] with the invasion of the Canadas, but the British Army mounted a successful defence with minimal regular forces, supported by militia and native allies, while the Royal Navy blockaded the United States of America's Atlantic coastline from Bermuda, strangling its merchant trade, and carried out amphibious raids including the [[Chesapeake Campaign]] with its [[Burning of Washington]]. As the United States failed to make any gains before British victory against France in 1814 freed British forces from Europe to be wielded against it, and as Britain had no aim in its war with its former colonies other than to defend its remaining continental territory, the war ended with the pre-war boundaries reaffirmed by the 1814 [[Treaty of Ghent]], ensuring Canada's future would be separate from that of the United States.<ref>Jeremy Black, ''The War of 1812 in the Age of Napoleon'' (2009) pp 204–37.</ref>

Following the final defeat of French Emperor [[Napoleon]] in 1815, Britain gained ownership of [[Trinidad]], Tobago, [[British Guiana]], and Saint Lucia, as well as other territories outside of the Western Hemisphere.<ref>James (1997), p. 165</ref> The [[Treaty of 1818]] with the United States set a large portion of the [[Canada–United States border]] at the [[49th parallel north|49th parallel]] and also established a joint U.S.–British occupation of [[Oregon Country]].<ref name=JMforeign>{{cite web|title=James Monroe: Foreign Affairs|url=https://millercenter.org/president/monroe/foreign-affairs|publisher=Miller Center of Public Affairs, University of Virginia|accessdate=25 February 2017|date=4 October 2016}}</ref> In the 1846 [[Oregon Treaty]], the United States and Britain agreed to split Oregon Country along the 49th parallel north with the exception of [[Vancouver Island]], which was assigned in its entirety to Britain.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}

After warring throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries in both Europe and the Americas, the British and French reached a lasting peace after 1815. Britain would fight only one war (the [[Crimean War]]) against a European power during the remainder of the nineteenth century, and that war did not lead to territorial changes in the Americas.<ref>James (1997), pp. 179–182</ref> However, the British Empire continued to engage in wars such as the [[First Opium War]] against China; it also put down rebellions such as the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]], the Canadian [[Rebellions of 1837–1838]], and the Jamaican [[Morant Bay rebellion]] of 1865.<ref>James (1997), pp. 190, 193</ref> A strong [[Abolitionism in the United Kingdom|abolition movement]] had emerged in the United Kingdom in the late-eighteenth century, and Britain abolished the slave trade in 1807.<ref>James (1997), pp. 185–186</ref> In the mid-nineteenth century, the economies of the British Caribbean colonies would suffer as a result of the [[Slavery Abolition Act 1833]], which abolished slavery throughout the British Empire, and the [[Sugar Duties Act 1846|1846 Sugar Duties Act]], which ended preferential tariffs for sugar imports from the Caribbean.<ref>James (1997), pp. 171–172</ref> To replace the labor of former slaves, British plantations on Trinidad and other parts of the Caribbean began to hire indentured servants from [[India]] and China.<ref>James (1997), p. 188</ref>

===Establishing the Dominion of Canada===

Despite its defeat in the American Revolutionary War and shift towards a new form of imperialism during the nineteenth century,<ref name="canny92"/><ref name="james119165"/> the British Empire retained numerous colonies in the Americas after 1783. During and after the American Revolutionary War, between 40,000 and 100,000 defeated [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalists]] migrated from the United States to Canada.<ref>Zolberg (2006), p. 496</ref> The 14,000 Loyalists who went to the [[Saint John River (New Brunswick)|Saint John]] and [[Saint Croix River (Maine – New Brunswick)|Saint Croix river]] valleys, then part of [[Nova Scotia]], felt too far removed from the provincial government in Halifax, so London split off [[New Brunswick]] as a separate colony in 1784.<ref>Kelley & Trebilcock (2010), p. 43</ref> The [[Constitutional Act of 1791]] created the provinces of [[Upper Canada]] (mainly English-speaking) and [[Lower Canada]] (mainly [[French language|French-speaking]]) to defuse tensions between the French and British communities, and implemented governmental systems similar to those employed in Britain, with the intention of asserting imperial authority and not allowing the sort of popular control of government that was perceived to have led to the American Revolution.<ref name="smith2829">Smith (1998), p. 28</ref> In 1815, Lieutenant-General Sir [[George Prevost]] was ''Captain-General and Governor-in-Chief in and over the Provinces of Upper-Canada, Lower-Canada, Nova-Scotia, and New~Brunswick, and their several Dependencies, Vice-Admiral of the same, Lieutenant-General and Commander of all His Majesty’s Forces in the said Provinces of Lower Canada and Upper-Canada, Nova-Scotia and New-Brunswick, and their several Dependencies, and in the islands of Newfoundland, Prince Edward, Cape Breton and the Bermudas, &c. &c. &c.'' Beneath Prevost, the staff of the British Army in ''the Provinces of Nova-Scotia, New-Brunswick, and their Dependencies, including the Islands of Newfoundland, Cape Breton, Prince Edward and Bermuda'' were under the Command of Lieutenant-General Sir [[John Coape Sherbrooke]]. Below Sherbrooke, the [[Bermuda Garrison]] was under the immediate control of the Lieutenant-[[Governor of Bermuda]], Major-General [[George Horsford]] (although the Lieutenant-Governor of Bermuda was eventually restored to a full civil Governorship, in his military role as Commander-in-Chief of Bermuda he remained subordinate to the Commander-in-Chief in Halifax, and naval and ecclesiastic links between Bermuda the [[Maritimes]] also remained; The military links were severed by Canadian confederation at the end of the 1860s, which resulted in the removal of the British Army from Canada and its Commader-in-Chief from Halifax when the Canadian Government took responsibility for the defence of Canada; The naval links remained until the Royal Navy withdrew from Halifax in 1905, handing its dockyard there over to the [[Royal Canadian Navy]]; The established [[Anglican Church of Bermuda|Church of England in Bermuda]], within which the Governor held office as [[Ordinary (church officer)|Ordinary]], remained linked to the colony of [[Newfoundland]] under the same [[Diocese of Newfoundland|Bishop]] until 1919).<ref>''The Quebec Almanack'', 1815</ref>

In response to the Rebellions of 1837–1838,<ref name="smith2829"/> Britain passed the [[Act of Union 1840|Act of Union]] in 1840, which united Upper Canada and Lower Canada into the [[Province of Canada]]. [[Responsible government]] was first granted to [[Nova Scotia]] in 1848, and was soon extended to the other British North American colonies. With the passage of the [[British North America Act, 1867]] by the [[British Parliament]], Upper and Lower Canada, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia were formed into the confederation of [[Canada]].<ref>Porter (1998), p.&nbsp;187</ref> Rupert's Land (which was divided into [[Manitoba]] and the [[Northwest Territories]]), British Columbia, and Prince Edward Island joined Canada by the end of 1873, but Newfoundland would not join Canada until 1949.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}} Like other British [[dominions]] such as [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], and [[South Africa]], Canada enjoyed autonomy over its domestic affairs but recognized the British monarch as [[head of state]] and cooperated closely with Britain on defense issues.<ref>James (1997), pp. 311–312, 341</ref> After the passage of the 1931 [[Statute of Westminster 1931|Statute of Westminster]],<ref>Rhodes, Wanna & Weller (2009), pp. 5–15</ref> Canada and other dominions were fully independent of British legislative control; they could nullify [[Law of the United Kingdom|British laws]] and Britain could no longer pass laws for them without their consent.<ref>Turpin & Tomkins, p. 48</ref>

United States independence, and the closure of its ports to British trade, combined with growing peace in the region which reduced the risk to shipping (resulting in smaller evasive merchantmen, such as those that Bermudian shipbuilders turned out, losing favour to larger [[Clipper|clippers]]), and the advent of metal hulls and steam engines, were to slowly strangle Bermuda's maritime economy, while its newfound importance as a Royal Navy and British Army base from which the [[North America and West Indies Station]] could be controlled meant increasing interest from the British Government in its governance.

Bermuda was grouped with British North America, especially Nova Scotia and Newfoundland (its closest British neighbours), following United States Independence. When war with France followed the [[French Revolution]], a [[Royal Naval Dockyard, Bermuda|Royal Naval Dockyard]] was established at Bermuda in 1795, which was to alternate with [[Royal Naval Dockyard, Halifax]] (Bermuda during the summers and Halifax during the winters) as the Royal Navy [[Admiralty House, Bermuda|headquarters]] and main base for the ''River St. Lawrence and Coast of America Station'' (which was to become the ''North America Station'' in 1813, the ''North America and Lakes of Canada Station'' in 1816, the ''North America and Newfoundland Station'' in 1821, the [[North America and West Indies Station]] about 1820, and finally the ''America and West Indies Station'' from 1915 to 1956) before becoming the year-round headquarters and main base from about 1818.

The regular [[Bermuda Garrison|army garrison]] (established in 1701 but withdrawn in 1784) was re-established in 1794 and grew during the Nineteenth Century to be one of the British Army's largest, relative to Bermuda's size. The blockade of the Atlantic seaboard ports of the United States and the [[Chesapeake Campaign]] (including the [[Burning of Washington]]) were orchestrated from Bermuda during the [[American War of 1812]]. Preparations for similar operations were carried out in Bermuda when the [[Trent Affair]] nearly brought Britain to war with the United States during the [[American Civil War]] (Bermuda had already been serving as the primary tran-shipment point for British and European manufactured arms which were smuggled into [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] ports, especially Charleston, South Carolina, by [[Blockade runner|blockade runners]]; cotton was brought out from the same ports by the blockade runners to be traded at Bermuda for the war materiel), and Bermuda played important roles (as a naval base, trans-Atlantic convoy forming-up point, as a connecting point in the [[Cable & Wireless plc|Cable and Wireless]] Nova Scotia-to-British West Indies submarine telegraph cable, as a wireless station, and from the 1930s as a site for airbases used as a staging point for trans-Atlantic flights and for operating anti-submarine air patrols over the North Atlantic) in the Atlantic theatre of the [[First World War]] and in the [[Battle of the Atlantic]] during the [[Second World War]], when the already existing Royal Navy, British Army, and Royal Air Force bases were joined by a Royal Canadian Navy base and naval and air bases of the allied United States. It remained a vital air and naval base during the Cold War, with American and Canadian bases existing alongside the British ones from the Second World War until 1995.

===British Honduras and Falkland Islands===

In the early 17th century, English sailors had begun cutting [[logwood]] in parts of coastal [[Central America]] over which the Spanish exercised little control. By the early 18th century, a small British settlement had been established on the [[Belize River]], though the Spanish refused to recognize British control over the region and frequently evicted British settlers. In the 1783 Treaty of Paris and the 1786 [[Convention of London (1786)|Convention of London]], Spain gave Britain the right to cut logwood and [[mahogany]] in the area between the [[Hondo River (Belize)|Hondo River]] and the Belize River, but Spain retained sovereignty over this area. Following the 1850 [[Clayton–Bulwer Treaty]] with the United States, Britain agreed to evacuate its settlers from the [[Bay Islands Department|Bay Islands]] and the [[Mosquito Coast]], but it retained control of the settlement on the Belize River. In 1862, Britain established the crown colony of the [[British Honduras]] at this location.<ref name=cs>Bolland, Nigel. "Belize: Historical Setting".

==Decolonization and overseas territories, 1945-present==
===Successful independence movements===
{{see also|Decolonization of the Americas}}
[[File:Member states of the Commonwealth of Nations.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|The [[Commonwealth of Nations]] consists of former territories of the British Empire in the Americas and elsewhere]]

With the onset of the [[Cold War]] in the late 1940s, the British government began to assemble plans for the independence of the empire's colonies in Africa, Asia, and the Americas. British authorities initially planned for a three-decades-long process in which each colony would develop a self-governing and democratic parliament, but unrest and fears of Communist infiltration in the colonies encouraged the British to speed up the move towards self-governance.<ref>James (1997), p. 538–539</ref> Compared to other European empires, which experienced wars of independence such as the [[Algerian War]] and the [[Portuguese Colonial War]], the British post-war process of decolonization in the Caribbean and elsewhere was relatively peaceful.<ref>James (1997), pp. 588–589</ref>

In an attempt to unite its Caribbean colonies, Britain established the [[West Indies Federation]] in 1958. The federation collapsed following the loss of its two largest members, Jamaica and Trinidad, each of which attained independence in 1962; Trinidad formed a union with Tobago to become the country of [[Trinidad and Tobago]].<ref name="knight14">Knight & Palmer (1989), pp. 14–15.</ref> The eastern Caribbean islands, as well as the Bahamas, gained independence in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s.<ref name="knight14"/> [[Guyana]] achieved independence in 1966. Britain's last colony on the American mainland, [[British Honduras]], became a [[self-governing colony]] in 1964 and was renamed [[Belize]] in 1973, achieving full independence in 1981. A [[Belizean-Guatemalan territorial dispute|dispute with Guatemala]] over claims to Belize was left unresolved.<ref>Lloyd (1996), pp.&nbsp;401, 427–29.</ref>

===Remaining territories===
{{main|British Overseas Territories}}

Historically, colonials shared the same citizenship (although the [[Magna Carta]] had effectively created English citizenship, citizens were still termed ''subjects of the King of England'' or ''English subjects''. With the union of the Kingdoms of England and Scotland, this was replaced with ''British Subject'', which encompassed citizens throughout the sovereign territory of the British Government, including the colonies) as Britons. Although historically all British Subjects had the right to vote for candidates, or to themselves stand for election, to the [[House of Commons]] (providing that they were male, prior to [[Women's suffrage|women's sufferage]], and met the [[property qualification]], when it applied). The British Government (as with the Government of the Kingdom of England before it) has never assigned seats in the [[House of Commons]] to any colony, effectively disenfranchising colonials at the Sovereign level of their government. There has also never been Peer in the House of Lords representing any colony. Colonials were therefore not consulted, or required to give their consent, to a series of Acts that passed by the Parliament of the United Kingdom between 1968 and 1982, which were to limit their rights and ultimately change their citizenship.

When several colonies were elevated before the [[Second World War]] to [[Dominion]] status, collectively forming the old [[Commonwealth of Nations#Adoption and formalisation of the Commonwealth|British Commonwealth]] (as distinct from the United Kingdom and its dependent colonies), their citizens remained British Subjects, and in theory, any British Subject born anywhere in the World had the same basic right to enter, reside, and work in the United Kingdom as a British Subject born in the United Kingdom whose parents were also both British Subjects born in the United Kingdom (although many governmental policies and practices acted to thwart the free exercise of these right by various demographic groups of colonials, including Greek Cypriots).

When the Dominions and an increasing number of colonies began choosing complete independence from the United Kingdom after the Second World War, the Commonwealth was transformed into a community of independent nations, each recognising the British monarch as their own head of state (creating separate monarchies with the same person occupying all of the separate Thrones; the exception being republican India). ''British Subject'' was replaced by the [[British Nationality Act 1948]] with ''Citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies'' for the residents of the United Kingdom and its colonies, as well as the Crown Dependencies. however, as it was desired to retain free movement for all Commonwealth Citizens throughout the Commonwealth, ''British Subject'' was retained as a blanket nationality shared by Citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies as well as the citizens of the various other Commonwealth realms.

The inflow of [[People of colour|coloured]] people to the United Kingdom during the 1940s and 1950s from both remaining colonies and newly independent Commonwealth nations was responded to with a racist backlash that led to the passing of the [[Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1962]], which restricted the rights of Commonwealth nationals to enter, reside and work in the United Kingdom. This Act also allowed certain colonials (primarily ethnic-Indians in African colonies) to retain Citizenship of the United Kingdom and Colonies if their colonies became independent, intended as a measure to ensure these persons did not become [[Statelessness|stateless]] if they were denied the citizenship of their newly independent nation.

Many ethnic-Indians did find themselves marginalised in newly-independent nations (notably [[Kenya]]) and relocated to the United Kingdom, in response to which the [[Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1968]] was rapidly passed, stripping all British Subjects (including Citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies) who were not born in the United Kingdom, and who did not have a Citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies parent born in the United Kingdom or some other qualification (such as existing residence status), of the rights to freely enter, reside and work in the United Kingdom.

This was followed by the [[Immigration Act 1971]], which effectively divided ''Citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies'' into two types, although their citizenship remained the same: Those from the United Kingdom itself, who retained the rights of free entry, abode, and work in the United Kingdom; and those born in the colonies (or in foreign countries to British Colonial parents), from whom those rights were denied.

The [[British Nationality Act 1981]], which entered into force on 1 January 1983<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1982/933/made |title=The British Nationality Act 1981 (Commencement) Order 1982 |access-date=18 March 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190401134239/http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1982/933/made |archive-date=1 April 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>}}, abolished ''British Subject'' status, and stripped colonials of their full British ''Citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies'', replacing it with ''British Dependent Territories Citizenship'', which entailed no right of abode or to work anywhere (other categories with even fewer rights were created at the same time, including [[British Overseas Citizen]] for former Citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies born in ex-colonies).

The exceptions were the [[Gibraltar]]ians (permitted to retain British Nationality in order to retain [[Citizenship of the European Union]]) and the [[Falkland Islands|Falkland Islanders]], who were permitted to retain the same new ''British Citizenship'' that became the default citizenship for those from the United Kingdom and the [[Crown dependencies]]. As the Act was widely understood to have been passed in preparation for the 1997 handover of [[British Hong Kong|Hong Kong]] to the [[Peoples' Republic of China]] (in order to prevent ethnic-Chinese British nationals from migrating to the United Kingdom), and given the history of neglect and racism those colonies with sizeable ''non-European'' (to use the British Government's parlance) populations had endured from the British Government since the ''end of Empire'', the application of the Act only to those colonies in which the citizenship was changed to ''British Dependent Territories Citizenship'' has been perceived as a particularly egregious example of the racism of the British Government.

The stripping of birth rights from at least some of the colonial CUKCs in 1968 and 1971, and the change of their citizenships in 1983, actually violated the rights granted them by [[Royal Charter]]s at the founding of the colonies. [[Bermuda]] (fully ''The Somers Isles or Islands of Bermuda''), by example, had been settled by the [[London Company]] (which had been in occupation of the archipelago since the 1609 wreck of the [[Sea Venture]]) in 1612, when it received its Third Royal Charter from [[James VI and I|King James I]], amending the boundaries of the [[Virginia Colony|First Colony of Virginia]] far enough across the Atlantic to include Bermuda. The citizenship rights guaranteed to settlers by King James I in the original Royal Charter of the 10 April, 1606, thereby applied to Bermudians:

{{quote|''Alsoe wee doe, for us, our heires and successors, declare by theise presentes that all and everie the parsons being our subjects which shall dwell and inhabit within everie or anie of the saide severall Colonies and plantacions and everie of theire children which shall happen to be borne within the limitts and precincts of the said severall Colonies and plantacions shall have and enjoy all liberties, franchises and immunites within anie of our other dominions to all intents and purposes as if they had been abiding and borne within this our realme of Englande or anie other of our saide dominions''.}}<ref>[https://www.gutenberg.org/files/36181/36181-h/36181-h.htm ''THE THREE CHARTERS OF THE VIRGINIA COMPANY OF LONDON: THE FIRST CHARTER April 10, 1606'', with an introduction by Samuel M. Bemiss, President, Virginia Historical Society. Virginia 350th Anniversary Celebration Corporation, Williamsburg, Virginia 1957. Transcribed by Project Gutenberg]</ref>

These rights were confirmed in the Royal Charter granted to the London Company's spin-off, the [[Somers Isles|Company of the City of London for the Plantacion of The Somers Isles]], in 1615 on Bermuda being separated from Virginia:

{{quote|And wee doe for vs our heires and successors declare by these Pnts, that all and euery persons being our subjects which shall goe and inhabite wthin the said Somer Ilandes and every of their children and posterity which shall happen to bee borne within the limits thereof shall haue and enjoy all libertyes franchesies and immunities of free denizens and natural subjectes within any of our dominions to all intents and purposes, as if they had beene abiding and borne wthin this our Kingdome of England or in any other of our Dominions<ref>Letters Patent of King James I, 1615.

In regards to former CUCKs of [[Saint Helena|St. Helena]], Lord Beaumont of Whitley in the [[House of Lords]] debate on the ''British Overseas Territories Bill'' on the 10 July, 2001, stated:

{{quote|Citizenship was granted irrevocably by Charles I.

Some Conservative Party backbenchers stated that it was the unpublished intention of the Conservative British Government to return to a single citizenship for the United Kingdom and all of the remaining territories once Hong Kong had been handed over to China. Whether this was so will never be known as by 1997 the Labour Party was in Government. The Labour Party had declared prior to the election that the colonies had been ill-treated by the British Nationality Act 1981, and it had made a promise to return to a single citizenship for the United Kingdom and the remaining territories part of its election manifesto. Other matters took precedence, however, and this commitment was not acted upon during Labour's first term in Government. The House of Lords, in which many former colonial Governors sat, lost patience and tabled and passed its own bill, then handed it down to the House of Commons to confirm. As a result, the British Dependent Territories were renamed the [[British Overseas Territory|British Overseas Territories]] in 2002 (the term ''dependent territory'' had caused much ire in the former colonies, such as well-heeled Bermuda that had been largely self-reliant and self-governed for nearly four centuries, as it implied not only that they were ''other than British'', but that their relationship to Britain and to ''real British people'' was both inferior and parasitic).<ref name=FAC>[[#refFAC|House of Commons Foreign Affairs Committee Overseas Territories Report]], pp.&nbsp;145–47</ref><ref>[https://john-warwick.blogspot.com/2007/09/race-and-development-of-immigration.html ''Race and the development of Immigration policy during the 20th century'', by Professor John Warwick, Monday, 24 September 2007]</ref><ref>[https://socialistworker.co.uk/art/46509/Windrush+scandal+shows+how+Britishness+stinks ''Windrush scandal shows how ‘Britishness’ stinks'', by Yuri Prasad. Socialist Worker]</ref>

At the same time, although Labour had promised a return to a single citizenship for the United Kingdom, Crown dependencies, and all remaining territories, ''British Dependent Territories Citizenship'', renamed ''British Overseas Territories Citizenship'', remained the default citizenship for the territories, other than the Falkland Islands and Gibraltar (for which ''British Citizenship'' is still the default citizenship). The bars to residence and work in the United Kingdom that had been raised against holders of ''British Dependent Territories Citizenship'' by The British Nationality Act 1981 were, however, removed, and ''British Citizenship'' was made attainable by simply obtaining a second British passport with the citizenship recorded as ''British Citizen'' (requiring a change to passport legislation as prior to 2002, it had been illegal to possess two British Passports).<ref>[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/lords/2001/jul/10/british-overseas-territories-bill-hl ''British Overseas Territories Bill [H.L.&#93;'']; House of Lords Debate, 10 July 2001. Volume 626, cc1014-37. UK Parliament website</ref>

Prior to 2002, all British Passports obtained in a British Dependent Territory were of a design modified from those issued in the United Kingdom, lacking the ''European Union'' name on the front cover, having the name of the specific territorial government noted on the front cover below "British Passport", and having the request on the inside of the front cover normally issued by the Secretary of State on behalf of The Queen instead issued by the Governor of the territory on behalf of The Queen. Although this design made it easier for United Kingdom Border Control to distinguish a colonial from a 'real' British citizen, these passports were issued within the territory to the holder of any type of British citizenship with the appropriate citizenship stamped inside. The ''normal'' British passports issued in the United Kingdom and by British consulates in Commonwealth and foreign countries were similarly issued to holders of any type of British citizenship with the appropriate citizenship, or ''citizenships'', stamped inside. From 2002, the thenceforth local governments of the British Overseas Territories in which British Overseas Territories Citizenship was the default citizenship were no longer allowed to issue or replace any British Passport except the type for their own territory only with British Overseas Territories Citizen recorded inside (and a stamp from the local government showing the holder has legal status as a local (in Bermuda, by example, the stamp records "the holder is registered as a Bermudian"), as neither British Dependent Territories Citizenship nor British Overseas Territories Citizenship actually entitles the holder to any more rights in any territory than in the United Kingdom, simply serving to enable colonials to be distinguished from ''real British people'' for the benefit of United Kingdom Border Control.

Since 2002, only the United Kingdom Government has issued ''normal'' British Passports with the citizenship stamped as ''British Citizen''. Since June, 2016, only the Passport Office in the United Kingdom is permitted to issue any type of British Passport. Local governments of territories can still accept passport applications, but must forward them to the Passport Office. This means that the territorial pattern of British Passport is no longer available, with all passports issued since then being of the standard type issued in the United Kingdom, with the appropriate type of British Citizenship recorded inside; a problem for Bermudians as they have always enjoyed freer entry into the United States than other British Citizens, but the United States had updated its entry requirements (prior to the 2001 terrorist attacks on New York City and Washington DC, Bermudians did not need a passport to enter the  US, and Americans did not need a passport to enter Bermuda. Since then, anyone entering the US, including US citizens, must present a passport) to specify that, in order to be admitted as a Bermudian the passport must be of the territorial type specific to Bermuda, with the country code inside being that used for Bermuda as distinct from other parts of the British Realm, with the citizenship stamped as ''British Dependent Territories Citizenship'' or ''British Overseas Territories Citizenship'', and the stamp from Bermuda Immigration showing the holder has Bermudian status. From the point of view of Bermuda Immigration, only the stamp showing the holder has Bermudian status indicates the holder is Bermudian, and that can be entered into any type of British Passport with any type of British citizenship recorded, so the United States requirements are more stringent than Bermuda's, and impossible to meet with any British Passport issued to a Bermudian since the end of June, 2016.<ref>[https://bm.usconsulate.gov/u-s-immigration-policy-related-bermuda-passports/ ''U.S. immigration policy related to Bermuda Passports '', website of the United States Consulate General in Bermuda]</ref><ref>[https://www.royalgazette.com/news/article/20190812/government-working-to-resolve-passport-issues/ ''Government working to resolve passport issues'', by Tim Smith, News Editor. the Royal Gazette, City of Hamilton, Pembroke, Bermuda. 12 August, 2019]</ref><ref>[https://socialistworker.co.uk/art/46580/A+British+passport+to++prejudice ''A British passport to prejudice'', Socialist Worker, Issue No. 2604.
