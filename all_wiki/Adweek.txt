==Blog network==
On January 15, 2015, following the acquisition of their previous parent, [[Mecklermedia|Mediabistro]], by Prometheus Global Media, ''Adweek'' formed the "Adweek Blog Network"—which consists of several [[Business-to-business|B2B]] blogs focusing on aspects of the mass media industry. They include ''[[Mediabistro (website)|AgencySpy]]'', which focuses on advertising agencies, ''Fishbowl DC'', a blog focusing on politics and the media, ''Fishbowl NY'', which focuses on [[New York City]] media, ''Galley Cat'', which focuses on publishing, ''LostRemote'', which focuses on [[social television]], ''PRNewser'', which focuses on public relations, ''SocialTimes'', and ''TVSpy'', which focuses on local television. While it operated alongside its parent publication, the blog network was kept separate from ''Adweek''{{'}}s main blog ''AdFreak''.<ref name="adweek-blognetlaunch">{{cite web|url=http://www.adweek.com/news/press/9-popular-sites-become-core-new-adweek-blog-network-162328|title=9 Popular Sites Become Core of New Adweek Blog Network|last=Griner|first=David|date=January 13, 2015|work=Adweek|access-date=16 January 2015}}</ref>

The most notable member of the blog network is ''TVNewser'', which focuses on the [[United States|American]] [[news media]] and broadcast industry.

Editor Kevin Allocca was hired in July 2009, and [[Alissa Krinsky]] serves as a contributor to the site. ''TVNewser'' is highly-read within the broadcasting industry: ''[[The New York Times]]'' characterized the site as being "read religiously by network presidents, media executives, producers and publicists ... because it provides a quick snapshot of the industry on any given day."<ref name="NYT-tvnewser">{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/20/business/media/20newser.html|title=The Kid With All the News About the TV News|last=Bosman|first=Julie|date=November 20, 2006|work=The New York Times|access-date=2006-10-22}}</ref> [[Brian Williams (news anchor)|Brian Williams]], then anchor of [[NBC Nightly News]], described the blog as "the closest thing to the bible of what's going on in [the news broadcasting] industry". [[CNN|CNN's]] [[Miles O'Brien (journalist)|Miles O'Brien]] felt that the site "makes me feel like I'm in the middle of a cocktail party of all people who know what's going on in my business."
