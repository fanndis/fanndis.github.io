The term "'''drag'''" refers to the performance of [[masculinity]], [[femininity]] or other forms of [[gender expression]]. A [[drag queen]] is someone (usually male) who performs femininity and a [[drag king]] is someone (usually female) who performs masculinity.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Rupp|first1=Leila J.|last2=Taylor|first2=Verta|author2-link= Verta Taylor |last3=Shapiro|first3=Eve Ilana|date=2010-06-01|title=Drag Queens and Drag Kings: The Difference Gender Makes|journal=Sexualities|language=en|volume=13|issue=3|pages=275–294|doi=10.1177/1363460709352725|s2cid=145721360|issn=1363-4607}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|last1=Rupp|first1=Leila J.|title=Drag Queens and Drag Kings|date=2016|encyclopedia=The Blackwell Encyclopedia of Sociology|pages=1–4|publisher=American Cancer Society|language=en|doi=10.1002/9781405165518.wbeosd087.pub2|isbn=978-1-4051-6551-8|last2=Taylor|first2=Verta|author2-link= Verta Taylor}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Gender Renegades: Drag Kings Are Too Radical for Prime Time|url=https://www.vogue.com/projects/13541679/drag-kings/|last=Mitchell|first=Nicole Phelps, Stef|date=2018-03-08|website=Vogue|language=en-US|access-date=2020-05-10}}</ref> The term may be used as a noun as in the expression ''in drag'' or as an adjective as in ''[[drag show]]''.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Abate |first1=Frank R. |last2=Jewell |first2=Elizabeth |title=The New Oxford American Dictionary |title-link=NOAD |year=2001 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |location=New York |isbn=978-0-19-511227-6 |page=[https://archive.org/details/newoxfordamerica0000unse/page/515 515] |oclc=959495250}}</ref>

==Etymology==
{{further|Drag queen#Terminology, scope and etymology}}
[[File:Drag Queens at High Heel Drag Race.jpg|thumb|Participants of the High Heel Drag Race in Washington, D.C.]]
The use of "drag" in this sense appeared in print as early as 1870<ref name="ReferenceA">Oxford English Dictionary 2012 (Online version of 1989 2nd. Edition) Accessed 11 April 2012</ref><ref>'I know what "in drag" means; it is the slang for going about in women's clothes.': ''The Times'' (London), 30 May 1870, p. 13, "The Men in Women's Clothes'</ref> but its origin is uncertain. One suggested etymological root is 19th-century theatre slang, from the sensation of long skirts trailing on the floor.<ref>[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=drag] Online Etymology Dictionary: Drag</ref>

==In folk custom==
Men dressed or disguised as women have featured in traditional customs and rituals for centuries. For example, the characters of some regional variants of the traditional [[mummers play]], which were traditionally always performed by men, include Besom Bet(ty); numerous variations on Bessy or Betsy; Bucksome Nell; Mrs Clagdarse; Dame Dolly; Dame Dorothy; Mrs Finney; Mrs Frail; and many others.<ref>[http://www.folkplay.info/Texts/CastIndex_.htm Master Mummers website: Character Name Index to Folk Play Scripts, Compiled by Peter Millington] Accessed 1 Dec 2011</ref>

The variant performed around [[Plough Monday]] in Eastern England is known as the Plough Play<ref name='Hole'>Hole, Christina (1978). ''A Dictionary of British Folk Customs'', p. 238, Paladin Granada, {{ISBN|0-586-08293-X}}</ref> (also Wooing Play or Bridal Play)<ref>[http://www.folkplay.info/Notts/Td00023.htm Folkplay Info: ''Bibliography of Nottinghamshire Folk Plays & Related Customs'', E.C.

"Maid Marian" of the [[Abbots Bromley Horn Dance]] is played by a man, and the Maid Marians referred to in old documents as having taken part in May Games and other festivals with [[Morris dance]]rs would most probably also have been men. The "consort" of the [[Castleton, Derbyshire|Castleton]] [[Castleton Garland Day|Garland King]] was traditionally a man (until 1956, when a woman took over the role) and was originally simply referred to as "The Woman".<ref>Hole, Christina (1978). ''A Dictionary of British Folk Customs,'' p. 114, Paladin Granada, {{ISBN|0-586-08293-X}}. "Until 1956, 'she' was always a man in female dress, veiled and riding side-saddle—the Man-Woman of tradition."</ref>

==Theatre==
{{See also|History of cross-dressing#On stage and on the screen}}
Cross-dressing elements of performance traditions are widespread cultural phenomena. In England, [[actor]]s in [[Shakespeare]]an [[Play (theatre)|plays]], and all Elizabethan theatre, were all male; female parts were played by young men in drag. Shakespeare used the conventions to enrich the gender confusions of ''[[As You Like It]],'' and [[Ben Jonson]] manipulated the same conventions in ''[[Epicœne, or The silent woman|Epicœne, or The Silent Woman]],'' (1609). The plot device of the film ''[[Shakespeare in Love]]'' (1998) turns upon this Elizabethan convention. During the reign of Charles II the rules were relaxed to allow women to play female roles on the London stage, reflecting the French fashion, and the convention of men routinely playing female roles consequently disappeared. However, in current-day [[Pantomime|British pantomime]], the [[pantomime dame]] is a traditional role played by a man in drag, while the [[principal boy]], such as [[Prince Charming]] or [[Dick Whittington#Dick Whittington—stage character|Dick Whittington]], is played by a girl.

Within the dramatic fiction, a [[double standard]] historically affected the uses of drag. In male-dominated societies where active roles were reserved to men, a woman might dress as a man under the pressures of her dramatic predicament. In these societies a man's position was above a woman's, causing a rising action that suited itself to tragedy, sentimental melodrama and comedies of manners that involved confused identities. A man dressed as a woman was thought to be a falling action only suited to broad low comedy and burlesque. [[Les Ballets Trockadero de Monte Carlo]] are an all-male ballet troupe where much of the humor is in seeing male dancers ''[[en travesti]];'' performing roles usually reserved to females, wearing tutus and dancing ''en pointe'' with considerable technical skill.

These conventions of male-dominated societies were largely unbroken before the 20th century, when rigid gender roles were undermined and began to dissolve. This evolution changed drag in the last decades of the 20th century. Among contemporary drag performers, the theatrical drag queen or street queen may at times be seen less as a "[[female impersonator]]" per se, but simply as a [[drag queen]], and the role of the queen existing as an identity based in neither mainstream male nor mainstream female conventions. Examples include [[The Cockettes]], [[Danny La Rue]] or [[RuPaul]].
 
In the 1890s the slapstick drag traditions of undergraduate productions (notably [[Hasty Pudding Theatricals]] at [[Harvard College]], annually since 1891 and at other [[Ivy League]] schools like [[Princeton University]]'s [[Triangle Club]] or the [[University of Pennsylvania]]'s [[Mask and Wig]] Club) were permissible fare to the same middle-class American audiences that were scandalized to hear that in [[New York City]], rouged young men in skirts were standing on tables to dance the [[can-can]] in [[Bowery]] dives like The Slide.{{cn|date=June 2020}} [[Drag show]]s were popular night club entertainment in New York in the 20s, then were forced underground, until the "Jewel Box Revue" played Harlem's Apollo Theater in the 1950s: "49 men and a girl". The girl received a roar of applause, when she was revealed as the same smart young man in dinner clothes who had been introducing each of the evening's acts.

== Ball culture ==
[[File:Voguing Masquerade Ball (30354045202).jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.75|Contestant in a ball at the [[National Museum of African Art]], 2016]]

{{Main|Ball culture}}
Ballroom culture (also known as "ball culture", and other names) is an underground [[LGBT culture|LGBT subculture]] that originated in 1920s New York<ref name="Hughes-2001">{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/collectedworksof0008hugh_h87ra |url-access=registration |page=[https://archive.org/details/collectedworksof0008hugh_h87ra/page/208 208] |title=The Collected Works of Langston Hughes |last=Hughes |first=Langston |date=2001 |publisher=[[University of Missouri Press]] |isbn=978-0-8262-1410-2 |oclc=45500326 |accessdate=4 December 2019}}</ref> in which people "walk" (i.e., compete) for [[Trophy|trophies]], prizes, and glory at events known as balls.

The culture extends beyond the extravagant formal events as many participants in ball culture also belong to groups known as "[[house (ball culture)|house]]s", a longstanding tradition in LGBT communities, and racial minorities, where chosen families of friends live in households together, forming relationships and community to replace families of origin from which they may be estranged.<ref name="HIV/AIDS risk reduction strategies for">{{cite web|last=Podhurst |first=L. |author2=Credle J. |title=HIV/AIDS risk reduction strategies for Gay youth of color in the 'house' community.

Ball culture first gained exposure to a mainstream audience in 1990 when its [[voguing]] dance style was featured in [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]'s song "[[Vogue (Madonna song)|Vogue]]", and in [[Jennie Livingston]]'s documentary ''[[Paris Is Burning (film)|Paris is Burning]]'' the same year.

==Opera==
In Baroque opera, where soprano roles for men were sung by [[castrato|castrati]], [[Handel]]'s heroine Bradamante, in the opera ''[[Alcina]],'' disguises herself as a man to save her lover, played by a male soprano; contemporary audiences were not the least confused. In Romantic [[opera]], certain roles of young boys were written for alto and soprano voices and acted by women ''en travestie'' (in English, in "[[trouser role]]s").<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bohemianopera.com/roles_af.htm|title=Bohemian Opera Resources and Information|website=www.bohemianopera.com|accessdate=27 March 2018}}</ref> The most familiar trouser role in pre-Romantic opera is Cherubino in [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]'s ''[[Marriage of Figaro]]'' (1786). Romantic opera continued the convention: there are trouser roles for women in drag in Rossini's ''Semiramide'' (Arsace), Donizetti's ''Rosamonda d'Inghilterra'' and ''Anna Bolena,'' [[Hector Berlioz|Berlioz]]'s ''Benvenuto Cellini,'' and even a page in Verdi's ''Don Carlo.'' The convention was beginning to die out with Siebel, the ingenuous youth in [[Charles Gounod]]'s ''Faust'' (1859) and the gypsy boy Beppe in Mascagni's ''L'Amico Fritz,'' so that Offenbach gave the role of Cupid to a real boy in ''Orphée aux Enfers.'' But [[Sarah Bernhardt]] played Hamlet in tights, giving French audiences a glimpse of Leg (the other in fact being a prosthesis) and Prince Orlovsky, who gives the ball in ''[[Die Fledermaus]],'' is a [[mezzo-soprano]], to somewhat androgynous effect. The use of ''travesti'' in [[Richard Strauss]]'s ''Rosenkavalier'' (1912) is a special case, unusually subtle and evocative of its 18th-century setting, and should be discussed in detail at ''[[Der Rosenkavalier]].''

==Film and television==
{{Main|Cross-dressing in film and television}}

The self-consciously risqué bourgeois high jinks of Brandon Thomas' ''[[Charley's Aunt]]'' (London, 1892) were still viable theatre material in ''[[La Cage aux Folles (film)|La Cage aux Folles]]'' 1978, which was remade, as ''[[The Birdcage]],'' as late as 1996.

[[Dame Edna Everage|Dame Edna]], the drag persona of Australian actor [[Barry Humphries]], is the host of several specials, including ''The Dame Edna Experience.'' Dame Edna also tours internationally, playing to sell-out crowds, and has appeared on TV's ''[[Ally McBeal]].'' Dame Edna represents an anomalous example of the drag concept. Her earliest incarnation was unmistakably a man dressed (badly) as a suburban housewife. Edna's manner and appearance became so feminised and glamorised that even some of her TV show guests appear not to see that the Edna character is played by a man. The furor surrounding Dame Edna's "advice" column in ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' magazine suggests that one of her harshest critics, actress [[Salma Hayek]], was unaware Dame Edna was a female character played by a man.

In 2009, [[RuPaul's Drag Race|Rupaul's Drag Race]] first premiered as a television show in the United States. The show has gained mainstream and global appeal, and it has exposed multiple generations of audiences to drag culture.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Drag Race Inc.: What's Lost When a Subculture Goes Pop?|url=https://www.vulture.com/2019/06/drag-race-inc-whats-lost-when-a-subculture-goes-pop.html|last=Jung|first=E.

===United States===
In the United States, early examples of drag clothing can be found in [[gold rush]] saloons of [[California]]. The [[Barbary Coast, San Francisco|Barbary Coast]] district of [[San Francisco]] was known for certain saloons, such as Dash, which attracted female impersonator patrons and workers.<ref name=":0" />

[[William Dorsey Swann]] was the first person to call himself "queen of drag." He was a former [[Slavery in the United States|slave]], who was freed after the [[American Civil War]], from Maryland. By the 1880s, he was organizing and hosting drag balls in [[Washington, D.C.]]. The balls included folk dances, such as the [[cakewalk]], and the male guests often dressed in female clothing.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Joseph|first=Channing Gerard|date=2020-01-31|title=The First Drag Queen Was a Former Slave|journal=The Nation|language=en-US|url=https://www.thenation.com/article/society/drag-queen-slave-ball/|access-date=2020-05-09|issn=0027-8378}}</ref>

In the early 20th century, drag—as an art form and culture—began to flourish with [[minstrel show]]s and [[vaudeville]]. Performers such as [[Julian Eltinge]] and [[Bothwell Browne]] were drag queens and vaudeville performers. The Progressive Era brought a decline in vaudeville entertainment, but drag culture began to grow in nightclubs and bars, such as [[Finocchio's Club|Finnochio's Club]] and [[Black Cat Bar]] in [[San Francisco]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|last=Boyd|first=Nan Alamilla|title=Wide Open Town: A History of Queer San Francisco to 1965|publisher=University of California Press|year=2003|isbn=0-520-24474-5}}</ref>

During this period, Hollywood films included examples of drag. While drag was often used as a last-resort tactic in situational farce (its only permissible format at the time), some films provided a more empathetic lens than others. In 1919, Bothwell Browne appeared in [[Yankee Doodle in Berlin]].<ref>{{Citation|title=Yankee Doodle in Berlin|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0010925/|access-date=2020-05-09}}</ref> In 1933, [[Victor and Victoria|Viktor und Viktoria]] came out in Germany, which later inspired [[First a Girl]] (1935) in the United States. That same year, [[Katharine Hepburn|Katherine Hepburn]] played a character who dressed as a male in [[Sylvia Scarlett]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=10 great drag films|url=https://www.bfi.org.uk/news-opinion/news-bfi/lists/10-great-drag-films|website=British Film Institute|language=en|access-date=2020-05-09}}</ref> In 1959, drag made a big Hollywood splash in ''[[Some Like It Hot]]'' (1959).<ref>{{Citation|title=Some Like It Hot|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0053291/|access-date=2020-05-09}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|last=Nicholas Barber|title=Why Some Like It Hot is the greatest comedy ever made|language=en|url=http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20170817-why-some-like-it-hot-is-the-greatest-comedy-ever-made|access-date=2020-05-09}}</ref>

In the 1960s, [[Andy Warhol]] and his [[The Factory|Factory]] scene included superstar drag queens, such as [[Candy Darling]] and [[Holly Woodlawn]], both immortalized in the [[Lou Reed]] song "[[Walk on the Wild Side (Lou Reed song)|Walk on the Wild Side]]."<ref>{{Cite web|title=Andy Warhol's Superstars Define 15 Minutes Of Fame|url=https://theculturetrip.com/north-america/usa/new-york/new-york-city/articles/andy-warhols-superstars/|last=Scarisbrick|first=Sean|website=Culture Trip|access-date=2020-05-09}}</ref>

By the early 1970s, drag was influenced by the [[psychedelic rock]] and [[hippie]] culture of the era. The San Francisco drag troupe, [[The Cockettes]] (1970–72), performed with glitter eyeshadow and gilded mustaches and beards. The troupe also coined the term "[[genderfuck]]."<ref>{{Cite web|title=The Cockettes: Rise and fall of the acid queens|url=https://www.salon.com/2000/08/23/weissman/|date=2000-08-23|website=Salon|language=en|access-date=2020-05-09}}</ref> Drag broke out from underground theatre in the persona of [[Glen Milstead|Divine]] in [[John Waters (filmmaker)|John Waters]]' ''[[Pink Flamingos]]'' (1972): see also [[Charles Pierce (female impersonator)|Charles Pierce]]. The [[Cult movie|cult hit]] movie musical, ''[[The Rocky Horror Picture Show]]'' (1975), inspired several generations of young people to attend performances in drag, although many of these fans would not call themselves drag queens or transvestites.<ref>{{Cite web|title=After 40 Years, 'Rocky Horror' Has Become Mainstream|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2015/09/after-40-years-rocky-horror-has-become-mainstream/407491/|last=Schwab|first=Katharine|date=2015-09-26|website=The Atlantic|language=en-US|access-date=2020-05-09}}</ref>

For many decades, American [[network television]], only the broadest slapstick drag tradition was generally represented. Few American TV comedians consistently used drag as a comedy device, among them [[Milton Berle]], [[Flip Wilson]] and [[Martin Lawrence]], although drag characters have occasionally been popular on sketch TV shows like ''[[In Living Color]]'' (with [[Jim Carrey]]'s grotesque female bodybuilder) and ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' (with the [[Gap Girls]], among others). On the popular 1960s military sitcom, ''[[McHale's Navy]],'' Ensign Parker ([[Tim Conway]]) sometimes had to dress in drag (often with hilarious results) whenever McHale and/or his crew had to disguise themselves in order to carry out their elaborate schemes. ''[[Gilligan's Island]]'' occasionally features men dressing in women's clothes, though this was not considered drag since it was not for a performance. The popular Canadian comedy group [[The Kids in the Hall]] also used drag in many of their skits.

On stage and screen, the actor-playwright-screenwriter-producer [[Tyler Perry]] has included his drag character of Madea in some of his most noted productions, such as the stage play ''[[Diary of a Mad Black Woman (play)|Diary of a Mad Black Woman]]'' and the [[Diary of a Mad Black Woman|feature film he based upon it]].

Maximilliana and [[RuPaul]] co-star together in the TV show ''[[Nash Bridges]]'' starring [[Don Johnson]] and [[Cheech Marin]] during the two-part episode "'Cuda Grace". Maximilliana, [[passing (gender)|looking passable]], leads one of the investigators to believe he is "real" and sexually advances only to learn that he is, in fact, male, much to his chagrin.

===United Kingdom===
In the United Kingdom, drag has been more common in comedy, on both film and television. [[Alastair Sim]] plays the headmistress Miss Millicent Fritton in ''[[The Belles of St Trinian's]]'' (1954) and ''[[Blue Murder at St Trinian's]]'' (1957). He played the role straight; no direct joke about the actor's true gender is made. However, Miss Fritton is quite non-feminine in her pursuits of betting, drinking and smoking. The gag is that whilst her school sends out girls into a merciless world, it is the world that need beware. Despite this, or perhaps because of Sim's portrayal, subsequent films in the series went on to use actresses in the headmistress role ([[Dora Bryan]] and [[Sheila Hancock]] respectively). The 21st century re-boot of the series however reverted to drag, with [[Rupert Everett]] in the role.

On television, [[Benny Hill]] portrayed several female characters, the [[Monty Python]] troupe and [[The League of Gentlemen (comedy)|The League of Gentlemen]] often played female parts in their skits. The League of Gentlemen are also credited with the first ever portrayal of "nude drag," where a man playing a female character is shown naked but still with the appropriate female anatomy, like fake breasts and a [[merkin]]. Within the conceit of the sketch/film, they are actually women: it is the audience who are in on the joke.

Monty Python women, whom the troupe called [[List of recurring Monty Python's Flying Circus characters#The Pepperpots|pepperpots]], are random middle-aged working/lower middle class typically wearing long brown coats that were common in the 1960s. Save for a few characters played by [[Eric Idle]], they looked and sounded very little like actual women with their caricatural outfits and shrill falsettos. However, when a sketch called for a "real" woman, the Pythons almost always called on [[Carol Cleveland]]. The joke is reversed in the Python film ''[[Life of Brian]]'' where "they" are pretending to be men, including obviously false beards, so that they can go to the stoning. When someone throws the first stone too early the [[Pharisee]] asks "who threw that," and they answer "she did, she did,..." in high voices. "Are there any women here today?" he says, "No no no" they say in gruff voices.

In the 1970s the most familiar drag artist on British television was [[Danny La Rue]]. La Rue's act was essentially a [[music hall]] one, following on from a much older, and less sexualised tradition of drag. His appearances were often in [[variety show]]s such as ''[[The Good Old Days (UK TV series)|The Good Old Days]]'' (itself a pastiche of music hall) and ''[[Sunday Night at the London Palladium]]''. Such was his popularity that he made a film, ''[[Our Miss Fred]]'' (1972). Unlike the "St Trinians" films, the plot involved a man having to dress as a woman.

[[Kenny Everett]] dragged up in his TV show as an over-the-top screen star called [[Cunt#Spoonerisms|Cupid Stunt]]. Kenny was particularly unconvincing as a woman because he had a beard to which a lot of flesh-tone makeup was applied. However she says "all in the best possible taste" as she exposed her knickers as she re-crossed her legs. She is in more of the Dame Edna genre. [[David Walliams]] and (especially) [[Matt Lucas]] often play female roles in the television comedy ''[[Little Britain]]'';  Walliams plays Emily Howard—a "rubbish transvestite," who makes an unconvincing woman.

In the UK, non-comedic representations of drag acts are less common, and usually a subsidiary feature of another story. A rare exception is the television play (1968) and film (1973), ''[[The Best Pair of Legs in the Business]]''. In the film version [[Reg Varney]] plays a holiday camp comedian and drag artist whose marriage is failing.

==Music==
The world of [[popular music]] has a venerable history of drag. [[Marlene Dietrich]] was a popular actress and singer who sometimes performed dressed as a man, such as in the films ''[[Der blaue Engel|Blue Angel]]'' and ''[[Morocco (1930 film)|Morocco]].'' In the [[glam rock]] era many male performers (such as [[David Bowie]] and [[The New York Dolls]]) donned partial or full drag. This tradition waned somewhat in the late 1970s but was revived in the [[New wave music|new wave]] era of the 1980s, as pop singers [[Boy George]] (of [[Culture Club]]), [[Pete Burns]] (of [[Dead or Alive (band)|Dead or Alive]]), and  [[Philip Oakey]] (of [[The Human League]]), frequently appeared in a sort of semi-drag, while female musicians of the era dabbled in their own form of [[androgyny]], with performers like [[Annie Lennox]], Phranc and The Bloods sometimes performing as drag kings.  The male [[grunge]] musicians of the 1990s sometimes performed wearing deliberately ugly drag—that is, wearing dresses but making no attempt to look feminine, not wearing makeup and often not even shaving their beards. ([[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] did this several times, notably in the [[In Bloom]] video.) However, possibly the most famous drag artist in music in the 1990s was [[RuPaul]]. In Japan there are several musicians in the [[visual kei]] scene, such as [[Mana (Japanese musician)|Mana]] ([[Moi dix Mois]] and [[Malice Mizer]]), [[Kaya (Japanese musician)|Kaya]] ([[Schwarz Stein]]), [[Hizaki]] and [[Jasmine You]] (both [[Versailles (band)|Versailles]]), who always or usually appear in full or semi-drag. Maximilliana worked with RuPaul in the ''Nash Bridges'' episode "Cuda Grace" and was a regular at the now defunct Queen Mary Show Lounge in Studio City, California until the very end. Max (short for Maximilliana) is most well known for her performance as Charlie/Claire in ''[[Ringmaster: the Jerry Springer Movie]].'' Max has also appeared in other movies including ''[[Shoot or Be Shot]]'' and ''[[10 Attitudes]]'' as well as on television shows including ''Nash Bridges'' as mentioned above, ''[[Clueless (TV series)|Clueless]],'' ''[[Gilmore Girls]],'' ''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno]],'' ''[[Mas Vale Tarde with Alex Cambert]],'' ''[[MadTV]],'' ''[[The Tyra Banks Show]],'' ''[[The Tom Joyner Show]],'' ''[[America's Got Talent]],'' and many others.

A [[drag queen]] (first use in print, 1941) is a man that dresses in drag, either as part of a performance or for personal fulfillment. Though many of these men are in fact [[cisgender]], the term "drag queen" distinguishes such men from [[transvestites]], [[transsexuals]] or [[transgender]] people. Those who "perform drag" as comedy do so while wearing dramatically heavy and often elaborate makeup, wigs, and prosthetic devices (breasts) as part of the performance costume.
Women who dress as men and perform as [[hypermasculine]] men are sometimes called [[drag king]]s; however, ''drag king'' also has a much wider range of meanings. It is currently most often used to describe entertainment (singing or lip-synching) in which there is no necessarily firm correlation between a performer's deliberately macho onstage persona and offstage gender identity or sexual orientation, just as  [[cisgender|cis]] men who do female drag for the stage may or may not identify as being either gay or female in their real-life personal identities.
