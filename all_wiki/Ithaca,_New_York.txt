'''Ithaca''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɪ|θ|ə|k|ə}} is a city in the [[Finger Lakes]] region of [[New York (state)|New York]], United States. It is the seat of [[Tompkins County, New York|Tompkins County]], as well as the largest community in the Ithaca–Tompkins County [[metropolitan area]]. This area contains the municipalities of the [[Ithaca (town), New York|Town of Ithaca]], the [[Village (New York)|village]] of [[Cayuga Heights, New York|Cayuga Heights]], and other towns and villages in [[Tompkins County, New York|Tompkins County]]. The city of Ithaca is located on the southern shore of [[Cayuga Lake]], in [[Central New York]], about {{convert|45|mi|km}} south-west of [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]].

== History ==

=== Early history ===
[[File:Cascadilla Gorge.jpg|thumb|left|Cascadilla Creek gorge]]
Native Americans lived in this area for thousands of years. When discovered by Europeans, this area was controlled by the [[Cayuga tribe]] of Indians, one of the Five Nations of the ''[[Haudenosaunee]]'' or [[Iroquois League]]. [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] [[missionaries]] from [[New France]] (Quebec) are said to have had a mission to convert the Cayuga as early as 1657.<ref name=first>{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Tk5IAAAAYAAJ&q=History+of+Ithaca%2C+New+York&pg=PA160|title=History of the First Presbyterian Church of Ithaca, New York, During One Hundred Years: The Anniversary Exercises, January Twenty-first to Twenty-fourth, 1904|first1=Ithaca (N Y. ) First Presbyterian|last1=church|first2=Ithaca, N.

[[Saponi]] and [[Tutelo]] peoples, Siouan-speaking tribes, later occupied lands at the south end of [[Cayuga Lake]]. Dependent tributaries of the Cayuga, they had been permitted to settle on the tribe's hunting lands at the south end of Cayuga Lake, as well as in Pony (originally Sapony) Hollow of what is known as present-day [[Newfield, New York]]. Remnants of these tribes had been forced from [[Virginia]] and [[North Carolina]] by tribal conflicts and European colonial settlement. Similarly, the [[Tuscarora people]], an Iroquoian-speaking tribe from the Carolinas, migrated after defeat in the [[Yamasee War]]; they settled with the [[Oneida people]] and became the sixth nation of the Haudenosaunee, with chiefs stating the migration was complete in 1722.

[[File:Ithaca, N.Y. LOC 95685698.tif|thumb|[[Perspective map]] of Ithaca published in 1882]]
During the Revolutionary War, four of the then six Iroquois nations helped the British attempt to crush the revolution, although bands made decisions on fighting in a highly decentralized way. Conflict with the rebel colonists was fierce throughout the Mohawk Valley and western New York. In retaliation for conflicts to the east and resentment at the savage way in which the Iroquois made war, the 1779 [[Sullivan Expedition]] was conducted against the Iroquois in the west of the state, destroying more than 40 villages and stored winter crops and forcing their retreat from the area.<ref name=dhs>"Ithaca: History", The DeWitt Historical Society of Tompkins County Library & Archive</ref> It destroyed the Tutelo village of Coregonal, located near what is now the junction of state routes [[New York State Highway 13|13]] and [[New York State Route 13A|13A]] just south of the Ithaca city limits. Most Iroquois were forced from the state after the Revolutionary War, but some remnants remained. The state sold off the former Iroquois lands to stimulate development and settlement by Americans; lands were also granted as payment to veterans of the war.

Within the current boundaries of the City of Ithaca, Native Americans maintained only a temporary hunting camp at the base of Cascadilla Gorge. In 1788, eleven men from [[Kingston, New York]] came to the area with two [[Delaware people]] (Lenape) guides, to explore what they considered wilderness. The following year Jacob Yaple, Isaac Dumond, and Peter Hinepaw returned with their families and constructed log cabins.<ref name=first /> That same year Abraham Bloodgood of Albany obtained a patent from the state for 1,400 acres, which included all of the present downtown west of Tioga Street.<ref name=Daniel>{{Cite web |url=http://tcpl.org/local-history/documents/ithaca-tc/Ithaca_and_its_Past/001to48.pdf |title=Snodderly, Daniel R., "Ithaca and its Past", DeWitt Historical Society of Tompkins County, 1982 |access-date=August 10, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160113164659/http://tcpl.org/local-history/documents/ithaca-tc/Ithaca_and_its_Past/001to48.pdf |archive-date=January 13, 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In 1790, the federal government and state began an official program to grant land in the area, known as the [[Central New York Military Tract]], as payment for service to the American soldiers of the Revolutionary War, as the government was cash poor. Most local land titles trace back to these Revolutionary war grants.

=== Partition of the Military Tract ===
As part of this process, the [[Central New York Military Tract]], which included northern Tompkins County, was surveyed by [[Simeon De Witt]], Bloodgood's son-in-law. De Witt was also the nephew of Governor [[George Clinton (vice president)|George Clinton]]. The Commissioners of Lands of New York State (chairman Gov. George Clinton) met in 1790. The Military Tract township in which proto-Ithaca was located was named the [[Ulysses, New York|Town of Ulysses]]. A few years later De Witt moved to Ithaca, then called variously "The Flats," "The City," or "Sodom";<ref name=first /><ref name=facts /> he renamed it for the Greek island home of Ulysses in the spirit of the multitude of settlement names in the region derived from [[classical literature]], such as [[Aurelius, New York|Aurelius]], [[Ovid, New York|Ovid]], and especially of [[Ulysses, New York]], the town that contained Ithaca at the time.<ref name=dhs />

Around 1791 De Witt surveyed what is now the downtown area into lots and sold them at modest prices. That same year John Yaple built a grist mill on Cascadilla Creek. The first frame house was erected in 1800 by Abram Markle.<ref name=first /> In 1804 the village had a postmaster and in 1805 a tavern.<ref name=Kammen>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cU0kI2ShQa8C&q=Ithaca%2C+New+York|title=Kammen, Carol.

=== Growth ===
Ithaca became a transshipping point for salt from curing beds near [[Salina, New York]] to buyers south and east. This prompted construction in 1810 of the Owego Turnpike.<ref name=Kammen /> When the [[War of 1812]] cut off access to Nova Scotia [[gypsum]], used for fertilizer, Ithaca became the center of trade in Cayuga gypsum.<ref name=Daniel /> The Cayuga Steamboat Company was organized in 1819 and in 1820 launched the first [[steamboat]] on Cayuga Lake, the ''Enterprise.''<ref name=Daniel /> In 1821, the village was incorporated at the same time the Town of Ithaca was organized and separated from the parent Town of Ulysses. In 1834, the [[Ithaca and Owego Railroad]]'s first horse-drawn train began service,<ref name=dhs /> connecting traffic on the east–west [[Erie Canal]] (completed in 1825) with the [[Susquehanna River]] to the south to expand the trade network.

With the depression of 1837, the railroad was re-organized as the Cayuga & Susquehanna. It was re-engineered with switchbacks in the late 1840s; in the late 20th century a short section of this route in the city and town of Ithaca was used for the [[Trails in Ithaca, New York#South Hill Recreation Way|South Hill Recreation Way]].

However, easier railroad routes were constructed, such as that of the Syracuse, Binghamton & New York (1854). In the decade following the Civil War, railroads were built from Ithaca to surrounding points ([[Geneva, New York|Geneva]]; [[Cayuga, New York|Cayuga]]; [[Cortland, New York|Cortland]]; and [[Elmira, New York]]; and [[Athens, Pennsylvania]]), mainly with financing from [[Ezra Cornell]]. The geography of the city, on a steep hill by the lake, has prevented it from being directly connected to a major transportation artery.  When the [[Lehigh Valley Railroad]] built its main line from Pennsylvania to [[Buffalo, New York]] in 1890, it bypassed Ithaca (running via eastern [[Schuyler County, New York|Schuyler County]] on easier grades), as the [[Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad]] had done in the 1850s.

[[File:Ithaca-guns 1916 a-oakley.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Ithaca Gun Co. - [[Annie Oakley]] gun, 1916]]
In the late 19th century, more industry developed in Ithaca. In 1883 William Henry Baker and his partners started the [[Ithaca Gun Company]], making shotguns. The original factory was located in the Fall Creek neighborhood of the city, on a slope later known as Gun Hill, where the nearby waterfall supplied the main source of energy for the plant. The company became an icon in the hunting and shooting world, its shotguns famous for their fine decorative work. Wooden gunstocks with knots or other imperfections were donated to the high school woodworking shop to be made into lamps.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Johnson |first=Kirk |date=October 15, 2000 |title=Ithaca Journal: Sweet Fishing and a Gorgeous Gorge, if You Don't Mind All That Old Lead |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/10/15/nyregion/ithaca-journal-sweet-fishing-gorgeous-gorge-if-you-don-t-mind-all-that-old-lead.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=March 2, 2016}}</ref> [[John Philip Sousa]] and [[Exhibition shooting|trick-shooter]] [[Annie Oakley]] favored Ithaca guns. In 1937 the company began producing the Ithaca 37, based on a 1915 patent by noted firearms designer [[John Browning]]. Its 12-gauge shotguns were the standard used for decades by the [[New York City Police Department]] and [[Los Angeles Police Department]].<ref name="nyt thai">{{Cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990DE0DB123BF933A05755C0A964948260|title=Ithaca Gun Co.

In 1885, Ithaca Children's Home was established on West Seneca Street. The orphanage had two programs at the time: a residential home for both orphaned and destitute children, and a day nursery.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.fcsith.org/history/ |title="History", Family & Children's Service of Ithaca |access-date=August 11, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150815021311/http://fcsith.org/history/ |archive-date=August 15, 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The village established its first trolley in 1887. Ithaca developed as a small manufacturing and retail center and was incorporated as a city in 1888. The largest industrial company in the area was Morse Chain, elements of which were absorbed into [[Emerson Electric Company|Emerson]] Power Transmission on South Hill and [[BorgWarner|Borg Warner Automotive]] in [[Lansing (town), New York|Lansing, New York]].

Ithaca claims to be the birthplace of the [[Sundae|ice cream sundae]], created in 1892 when fountain shop owner [[Chester Platt]] "served his local priest vanilla ice cream covered in cherry syrup with a dark candied cherry on top.

In 1903 a [[typhoid]] [[epidemic]], resulting from poor sanitation infrastructure, devastated the city. One out of ten citizens fell ill or died.

In 1900 Cornell anatomy professor G.S. Moler made an early movie using frame-by-frame technology. For ''The Skeleton Dance,'' he took single-frame photos of a human skeleton in varying positions, giving the illusion of a dancing skeleton. During the early 20th century, Ithaca was an important center in the [[silent film]] industry. These films often featured the local natural scenery. Many of these films were the work of [[Leopold Wharton]] and his brother [[Theodore Wharton|Theodore]]; their [[The Whartons Studio|studio]] was on the site of what is now [[Stewart Park (Ithaca, New York)|Stewart Park]].<ref name=facts>{{Cite web|url=https://www.visitithaca.com/facts-trivia|title=Facts About Ithaca, NY &#124; Visit Ithaca, NY|website=www.visitithaca.com|accessdate=August 2, 2019}}</ref>

The Star Theatre on East Seneca Street was built in 1911 and became the most popular vaudeville venue in the region. Wharton movies were also filmed and shown there.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.whartonstudiomuseum.org/history/ithaca-silent-movie-history/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150808055532/http://www.whartonstudiomuseum.org/history/ithaca-silent-movie-history/|url-status=dead|title=Simmons-Lynch, Julie.

Few of the silent films made in Ithaca have been preserved.

After World War II, the Langmuir Research Labs of [[General Electric]] developed as a major employer; the defense industry continued to expand. GE's headquarters were in Schenectady, New York, to the east in the Mohawk Valley.

For decades, the [[Ithaca Gun Company]] tested their shotguns behind the plant on Lake Street; the shot fell into the [[Fall Creek (New York)|Fall Creek]] gorge at the base of [[Ithaca Falls]]. Lead accumulated in the soil in and around the factory and gorge. A major lead clean-up effort sponsored by the United States [[Superfund (environmental law)|Superfund]] took place from 2002 to 2004, managed through the [[Environmental Protection Agency]].<ref>[http://yosemite.epa.gov/opa/admpress.nsf/b1ab9f485b098972852562e7004dc686/1d33c848fd4ada78852571220072d73d!OpenDocument "EPA Finishes $4.8 Million Cleanup at Ithaca Gun"], United States Environmental Protection Agency, October 29, 2004.

== Geography and climate ==

=== Geography ===
[[File:Ithaca Hemlock Gorge.JPG|thumb|left|Hemlock Gorge along Fall Creek before emptying into Beebe Lake on Cornell's campus]]
The valley in which Cayuga Lake is located is long and narrow with a north–south orientation. Ithaca is located at the southern end (the "head") of the lake, but the valley continues to the southwest behind the city. Originally a river valley, it was deepened and widened by the action of Pleistocene ice sheets over the last several hundred thousand years. The lake, which drains to the north, formed behind a dam of glacial [[moraine]]. The rock is predominantly [[Devonian]] and, north of Ithaca, is relatively fossil rich. [[Glacial erratic]]s can be found in the area. The world-renowned fossils found in this area can be examined at the [[Museum of the Earth]].

Ithaca was founded on flat land just south of the lake—land that formed in fairly recent geological times when silt filled the southern end of the lake. The city ultimately spread to the adjacent hillsides, which rise several hundred feet above the central flats:  East Hill, West Hill, and South Hill. Its sides are fairly steep, and a number of the streams that flow into the valley from east or west have cut deep canyons, usually with several [[waterfall]]s.

The natural vegetation of the Ithaca area, seen in areas unbuilt and not been farmed on, is northern [[Temperate broadleaf and mixed forests|temperate broadleaf forest]], dominated by [[deciduous plant|deciduous trees]].

According to the [[Köppen climate classification]] method, Ithaca experiences a warm-summer [[humid continental climate]], also known as a hemiboreal climate (''Dfb''). Summers are warm but brief, and it is cool-to-cold the rest of the year, with long, snowy winters; an average of {{Convert|67|in|cm|abbr=on}} of snow falls per year. In addition, frost may occur any time of year except mid-summer.

Winter is typically characterized by freezing temperatures, cloudy skies, and light-to-moderate snows, with some heavier falls; the largest snowfall in one day was {{Convert|26.0|in|cm|abbr=on}} on February 14, 1914. But the season is also variable; there can be short mild periods with some rain, but also outbreaks of frigid air with night temperatures down to {{convert|-10|°F|0}} or lower. Summers usually bring sunshine, along with moderate heat and humidity, but also frequent afternoon thunderstorms. Nights are pleasant and sometimes cool. Occasionally, there can be heatwaves, with temperatures rising into the {{Convert|90|°F}} to {{Convert|95|°F}} range, but they tend to be brief.

The average date of the first freeze is October 5, and the average date of the last freeze is May 15, giving Ithaca a [[growing season]] of 141 days. The average date of the first and last snowfalls are November 12 and April 7, respectively. Extreme temperatures range from {{Convert|−25|°F|0}} as recently as February 2, 1961 up to {{Convert|103|°F|0}} on July 9, 1936.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://w2.weather.gov/climate/xmacis.php?wfo=bgm |title=NowData – NOAA Online Weather Data |publisher=NOAA |accessdate=December 14, 2011}}</ref>

The valley flatland has slightly cooler weather in winter, and occasionally Ithaca residents experience simultaneous snow on the hills and rain in the valley.  The phenomenon of mixed precipitation (rain, wind, and snow), common in the late fall and early spring, is known tongue-in-cheek as ''ithacation'' to many of the local residents.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.tompkinsready.org/disaster/winter.html |title=Winter Weather |publisher=TompkinsREADY |accessdate=December 30, 2010}}</ref>

Due to the [[microclimate]]s created by the impact of the lakes, the region surrounding Ithaca ([[Finger Lakes]] [[American Viticultural Area]]) experiences a short but adequate growing season for winemaking similar to the Rhine Valley wine district of Germany.  As such, the region is home to many wineries.

== Local government ==
[[File:Ithaca City Hall, Green Street.jpg|thumb|left|Ithaca City Hall at 108 East Green Street]]

There are two governmental entities in the area: the [[Ithaca (town), New York|Town of Ithaca]] and the [[Ithaca (city), New York|City of Ithaca]]. The Town of Ithaca is one of the nine towns comprising Tompkins County. The City of Ithaca is surrounded by, but legally independent of, the Town.

The City of Ithaca has a [[mayor–council government]]. The charter of the City of Ithaca provides for a full-time mayor and city judge, each independent and elected [[at-large]]. Since 1995, the mayor has been elected to a four-year term, and since 1989, the city judge has been elected to a six-year term.

Since 1983, the city has been divided into five wards. Each elects two representatives to the city council, known as the Common Council, for staggered four-year terms. In March 2015, the Common Council unanimously adopted a [[Resolution (law)|resolution]] recognizing freedom from [[domestic violence]] as a fundamental [[human right]].<ref>{{Cite web|last1=Hill |first1=David|title=City: Freedom from domestic violence is a human right|url=http://www.ithacajournal.com/story/news/local/2015/03/15/council-backs-fighting-domestic-violence/70297186/|website=www.ithacajournal.com|publisher=Ithaca Journal|accessdate=March 15, 2015}}</ref>

Since students won the right to vote where they attend colleges, some have become more active in local politics. In 2004, [[Gayraud Townsend]], a 20-year-old senior in Cornell's School of Industrial and Labor Relations, was sworn in as alderman of the city council, representing the 4th Ward. He is the first black male to be elected to the council and was then the youngest African American to be elected to office in the United States.<ref name="american" /> He served his full term and has mentored other young student politicians.<ref name="cornell" /> In 2011, Cornell graduate [[Svante Myrick]] was elected Mayor of the City of Ithaca, becoming the youngest mayor in the city's history.<ref name="svante" />

In December 2005, the City and Town governments began discussing opportunities for increased government consolidation, including the possibility of joining the two into a single entity. This topic had been previously discussed in 1963 and 1969. [[Cayuga Heights, New York|Cayuga Heights]], a village adjacent to the city on its northeast, voted against annexation into the city of Ithaca in 1954.

=== Politics ===
Politically, the majority of city's voters (many of them students) have supported [[American liberalism|liberalism]] and the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]. A November 2004 study by [[ePodunk]] lists it as New York's most liberal city.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.epodunk.com/top10/liberal/index.html |title=Most liberal places in America |publisher=ePodunk.com |accessdate=April 30, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150408142929/http://www.epodunk.com/top10/liberal/index.html |archive-date=April 8, 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref> This contrasts with the more [[American conservatism|conservative]] leanings of the generally rural Upstate New York region; the city's voters are also more liberal than those in the rest of [[Tompkins County]]. In 2008, [[Barack Obama]], running against New York State's US Senator Hillary Clinton, won Tompkins County in the Democratic Presidential Primary, the only county that he won in New York State.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.elections.ny.gov/NYSBOE/Elections/2008/Primary/PP-DEM-PRES-2008.pdf|title=2008 presidential general election results|publisher=New York State Board of Elections|accessdate=April 30, 2015}}</ref> Obama won Tompkins County (including Ithaca) by a wide margin of 41% over his opponent [[John McCain]] in the November 2008 election.

== Education ==
[[File:Cornell University from McGraw Tower.JPG|thumb|left|Cornell University from McGraw Tower]]

===Colleges===
Ithaca is a major educational center in [[Central New York]]. The two major post-secondary educational institutions located in Ithaca were each founded in the late nineteenth century. In 1865, Ezra Cornell founded [[Cornell University]], which overlooks the town from East Hill. It was opened as a [[coeducational]] institution. Women first enrolled in 1870.

== Economy ==
[[File:Ithaca Farmers Market, Steamboat Landing, Ithaca NY.jpg|thumb|right|Ithaca Farmer's market at Steamboat Landing]]
The economy of Ithaca is based on education, and further supported by agriculture, technology, and tourism. As of 2006, Ithaca has continued to have one of the few expanding economies in New York State outside New York City. It draws commuters for work from the neighboring rural counties of [[Cortland County, New York|Cortland]], [[Tioga County, New York|Tioga]], and [[Schuyler County, New York|Schuyler]], as well as from the more urbanized [[Chemung County, New York|Chemung County]].

Ithaca has tried to maintain its traditional downtown shopping area with its pedestrian orientation; this includes the [[Ithaca Commons]] pedestrian mall and Center Ithaca, a small mixed-use complex built at the end of the urban renewal era. Another commercial center, Collegetown, is located next to the Cornell campus. It features a number of restaurants, shops, and bars, and an increasing number of high-rise apartments. It is primarily frequented by Cornell University students.

Ithaca has many of the businesses characteristic of small American university towns: bookstores, art house cinemas, craft stores, and vegetarian-friendly restaurants. The collective [[Moosewood Restaurant]], founded in 1973, published a number of vegetarian cookbooks.<ref name=facts /> ''[[Bon Appetit]]'' magazine ranked it among the thirteen most influential restaurants of the 20th century.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.newyorkupstate.com/ithaca/2016/01/moosewood_ithacas_nationally_known_vegetarian_restaurant_destination_photos.html|title=Moosewood: Ithaca's acclaimed vegetarian restaurant destination (photos)|last=Schild|first=Scott|date=January 14, 2016|website=New York Upstate|access-date=April 9, 2020}}</ref>  Ithaca has many local restaurants and chains both in the city and town with a range of ethnic foods and has been regarded as having more restaurants per capita than New York City.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2018/nov/20/ithaca-college-town-new-york-state-usa-bars-restaurants-music-theatre|title=The best towns and small cities in the US: Ithaca, New York state|first=Emma|last=John|date=November 20, 2018|accessdate=August 2, 2019|via=www.theguardian.com}}</ref> It has become a destination and residence for retirees.

[[File:TompkinsConsolidatedAreaTransitBus2.JPG|thumb|A TCAT bus]]
[[File:Voyager golden record 103 highway.gif|thumb|Route 13 in Ithaca as photographed for an image included on the [[Voyager Golden Record]]]]
Ithaca is in the rural Finger Lakes region about {{Convert|225|mi|km}} northwest of New York City; the nearest larger cities, [[Binghamton, New York|Binghamton]] and [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]], are an hour's drive away by car, [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]] and [[Scranton, Pennsylvania|Scranton]] are two hours, [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]] and [[Albany, New York|Albany]] are three. [[New York City]], [[Philadelphia]], [[Toronto]], and [[Ottawa]] are about four hours away.

Ithaca lies at over a half hour's drive from any [[interstate highway]], and all car trips to Ithaca involve some driving on two-lane state rural highways.  The city is at the convergence of many regional two-lane state highways: Routes [[New York State Route 13|13]], [[New York State Route 13A|13A]], [[New York State Route 34|34]], [[New York State Route 79|79]], [[New York State Route 89|89]], [[New York State Route 96|96]], [[New York State Route 96B|96B]], and [[New York State Route 366|366]]. These are usually not congested except in Ithaca proper. However, Route 79 between the I-81 access at Whitney Point and Ithaca receives a significant amount of Ithaca-bound congestion right before Ithaca's colleges reopen after breaks.

In July 2008, a non-profit called Ithaca Carshare began a [[carsharing]] service in Ithaca. Ithaca Carshare has a fleet of vehicles shared by over 1500 members as of July 2015 and has become a popular service among both city residents and the college communities. Vehicles are located throughout Ithaca downtown and the two major institutions. With Ithaca Carshare as the first locally run carsharing organization in New York State, others have since launched in [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]], Albany, NY, and [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]].

Rideshare services to promote carpooling and vanpooling are operated by ZIMRIDE and VRIDE. A community mobility education program, Way2Go is operated by Cornell Cooperative Extension of Tompkins County.  Way2Go's website provides consumer information and videos. Way2Go works collaboratively to help people save money, stress less, go green and improve mobility options.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ccetompkins.org/community/way2go#sthash.IocP71mT.dpuf |title=Cornell Cooperative Extension &#124; Way2Go |publisher=Ccetompkins.org |date=April 16, 2015 |accessdate=April 30, 2015}}</ref> The 2-1-1 Tompkins/Cortland Help line connects people with services, including transportation, in the community, by telephone and web on a 24/7 basis.

As a growing urban area, Ithaca is facing steady increases in levels of vehicular traffic on the city grid and on the state highways. Outlying areas have limited bus service, and many people consider a car essential. However, many consider Ithaca a walkable and bikeable community. One positive trend for the health of downtown Ithaca is the new wave of increasing [[urban density]] in and around the Ithaca Commons. Because the downtown area is the region's central business district, dense mixed-use development that includes housing may increase the proportion of people who can walk to work and recreation, and mitigate the likely increased pressure on already busy roads as Ithaca grows. The downtown area is also the area best served by frequent public transportation. Still, traffic congestion around the Commons is likely to progressively increase.

=== Bus ===
There is frequent intercity bus service by [[Greyhound Lines]], New York Trailways, [[OurBus]], and Shortline (Coach USA), particularly to Binghamton and New York City, with limited service to Rochester, [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]] and Syracuse, and (via connections in Binghamton) to Utica and Albany. OurBus also provides limited holiday services to [[Allentown, Pennsylvania]], [[Philadelphia]], and [[Washington, DC]]. Cornell University runs a premium campus to campus bus between its Ithaca campus and its medical school in [[Manhattan, New York City]] which is open to the public. Starting September 2019, intercity buses serving Ithaca operated from the downtown bus stop at 131 East Green Street, as the former [[Ithaca Bus Station|Greyhound bus station]] on West State Street closed due to staff retirement and building maintenance issues.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://locations.greyhound.com/bus-stations/us/ny/ithaca/bus-station-150898|title=Ithaca NY Bus Station {{!}} Greyhound|website=locations.greyhound.com|access-date=2019-12-05}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ithaca.com/news/future-of-ithaca-s-bus-depot-in-the-air/article_c53fcc16-7ee1-11e8-8d06-4b99a57d66db.html|title=Future of Ithaca's bus depot in the air|last=Reynolds|first=Mark H.

(TCAT, Inc.) is a not-for-profit corporation that provides public transportation for Tompkins County, New York. TCAT was reorganized as a non-profit corporation in 2004 and is primarily supported locally by Cornell University, the City of Ithaca and Tompkins County. TCAT's ridership increased from 2.7 million in 2004 to 4.4 million in 2013.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.tcatbus.com/files/all/tcat_2013_yearbook_-_final.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141027015210/http://www.tcatbus.com/files/all/tcat_2013_yearbook_-_final.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-date=October 27, 2014|date=October 27, 2014|accessdate=August 2, 2019}}</ref> TCAT operates 34 routes, many running seven days a week.

In 2019 the Ithaca Central Railroad, a [[Watco]] subsidiary, took over the operation of the [[Norfolk Southern]] Ithaca Secondary line from [[Sayre, Pennsylvania]] to the Lake Ridge site of the [[AES Corporation|AES]] Cayuga, a coal power plant (known as Milliken Station during NYSEG ownership). Unit trains of coal, delivered at [[Sayre, Pennsylvania]] from the [[Norfolk Southern]] are now rare. The main traffic is salt from the Cargill salt mine on the east shore of Cayuga Lake near Myers Point. The Norfolk Southern tracks headed north on the Auburn and Ithaca Branch, include in Ithaca a distinctive section that runs along the side of Fulton St. (NY13 southbound), although not in the street itself.
