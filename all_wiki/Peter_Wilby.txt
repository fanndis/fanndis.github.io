==''New Statesman'' editor==
Wilby was the editor of the ''[[New Statesman]]'' from 1998 to 2005.

In February 2002, Wilby apologised and took personal responsibility for running the cover of the 14 January 2002 issue.<ref>{{cite news |last=Hodgson |first=Jessica |url= https://www.theguardian.com/media/2002/feb/07/pressandpublishing.politics |title=Editor apologises for 'Kosher Conspiracy' furore |work=The Guardian |location= London |date=7 February 2002 |accessdate=31 May 2018}}</ref><ref name="Wilby110202">{{cite news |last=Wilby |first=Peter |url= https://www.newstatesman.com/node/194341 |title=Editorial |work=New Statesman |date=11 February 2002 |accessdate=31 May 2018}}</ref> It featured the headline, "A Kosher Conspiracy" promoting articles by Dennis Sewell and [[John Pilger]] respectively concerning the alleged [[Zionist lobby in Britain]] and [[Tony Blair]]'s appointment of [[Michael Levy, Baron Levy|Michael Levy]] as his special envoy in the Middle East.<ref>{{cite book |last=Rich |first=Dave |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=L07RDAAAQBAJ&pg=PT143 |title=The Left's Jewish Problem: Jeremy Corbyn, Israel and Anti-Semitism |location=London |publisher=Biteback |year=2016 |page=143 |isbn=9781785901515}}</ref> The ''NS'' cover was denounced by [[David Triesman, Baron Triesman|David Triesman]], then general secretary of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], as being [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]].<ref name="Lister070202">{{cite news |last=Lister |first=David |url= https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/new-statesman-admits-mistake-over-kosher-conspiracy-cover-9130124.html |title=''New Statesman'' admits mistake over Kosher Conspiracy cover |work=The Independent |location= London |date=7 February 2002 |accessdate=31 May 2018}}</ref> Wilby, in his apology, wrote that the cover was "not intended to be anti-Semitic".<ref name="Wilby110202"/><ref name="Lister070202"/>

"I don't accept that there's such a thing as New Labour", Wilby told David Lister of ''[[The Independent]]'' in July 2002. He described the term as being "an invention of the marketing people close to the Labour leader".<ref name="Lister">{{cite news |last=Lister |first=David |url= https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/left-field-183403.html |title=Left Field |work=The Independent |location= London |date=8 July 2002 |accessdate=31 May 2018}}</ref> A scoop Wilby was fond of at the time concerned an interview with the Physician, Professor and Labour peer [[Robert Winston]], whose comparison of the [[National Health Service]] (NHS) with [[Health care in Poland|health provision in Poland]], Wilby said had changed government policy.<ref name="Lister"/>

[[Julia Langdon]] wrote in the ''[[British Journalism Review]]'' around the same time that the ''NS'' under Wilby had a reputation in the "political trade" for "being either dull, or silly". With Wilby as editor, it had become "ever more critical of the Government, notably with the anti-American line he took after September 11".<ref>{{cite news|last=Langdon|first=Julia|url=http://www.bjr.org.uk/data/2002/no2_langdon|title=Is the bell tolling for the weeklies?|work=British Journalism Review|volume=13|issue=2|year=2002|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160127110444/http://www.bjr.org.uk/data/2002/no2_langdon|archive-date=27 January 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> A ''New Statesman'' article in autumn 2004 by [[Robert Service (historian)|Robert Service]], then Professor of Russian History at [[University of Oxford|Oxford University]], and in particular the cover illustration, portrayed [[Tony Blair]] as the modern equivalent of [[Joseph Stalin]].<ref name="Lloyd2005">{{cite news |last=Lloyd |first=John |url= https://www.ft.com/content/eb58d028-e39a-11d9-b6f0-00000e2511c8 |title=Happy-slap politics |work=Financial Times |location= London |date=24 June 2005 |accessdate=31 May 2018}}</ref><ref name="Cathcart2004">{{cite news |last=Cathcart |first=Brian |url= https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/if-circulation-is-low-have-a-row-just-ask-cristina-and-peter-how-749994.html |title=If circulation is low, have a row.

Wilby's deputy, [[Cristina Odone]], resigned in early November 2004 for unconnected reasons, although she did object to the cover.<ref>{{cite news|last=Byrne|first=Ciar|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/plots-paranoia-and-politics-at-new-statesman-18445.html|title=Plots, paranoia and politics at ''New Statesman''|work=The Independent|date=3 November 2004|accessdate=31 May 2018}}</ref> Odone and Wilby praised each other in the media and denied having had a row,<ref name="Cathcart2004"/> although claims of such professional disagreements were made in the press quoting Odone herself.<ref>{{cite news |url= https://www.scotsman.com/news/uk/new-left-is-up-to-its-old-tricks-1-561176 |title=New Left is up to its old tricks |work=The Scotsman |location= Edinburgh |date=4 November 2004|accessdate=31 May 2018}}</ref> Wilby, she said, was "the old-fashioned socialist who" remained "true to his ideals".<ref>{{cite news |last=Smith |first=David |url= https://www.theguardian.com/business/2004/nov/07/politicsandthemedia.politics |title=An unstatesmanlike affair |work=The Observer |location= London |date=7 November 2004 |accessdate=31 May 2018}}</ref>

Wilby himself was dismissed from the post of editor in 2005 by then owner [[Geoffrey Robinson]].<ref name="Lloyd2005"/> As a result of the magazine being unsympathetic to [[New Labour]], Cristina Odone wrote in ''[[The Observer]]'' that she believed Wilby was pushed out of his post in preparation for [[Gordon Brown]] becoming prime minister.<ref>{{cite news|last=Odone|first=Cristina|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2005/may/16/mondaymediasection7|title=Why Wilby was pushed|work=The Observer|date=16 May 2005|accessdate=31 May 2018}}</ref> Wilby was the longest serving editor of the ''New Statesman'' since [[Kingsley Martin]], who had retired from the post in 1960.<ref name="Wilby2005a">{{cite news|last=Wilby|first=Peter|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2005/sep/12/pressandpublishing.politicsandthemedia|title=Statesman-like regrets|work=The Guardian|date=12 September 2005|accessdate=31 May 2018}}</ref><ref name="Wilby2005b">{{cite news|last=Wilby|first=Peter|url=http://www.bjr.org.uk/data/2005/no3_wilby|title=Swimming (weakly) against the tide|work=British Journalism Review|volume=16|issue=3|year=2005|archive-url=https://archive.is/20121223221809/http://www.bjr.org.uk/data/2005/no3_wilby|archive-date=23 December 2012|pages=23–30|url-status=dead}}</ref>

While circulation was much the same when he assumed the role as when he relinquished it in 2005, Wilby wrote in an article for the ''British Journalism Review'' that he managed to turn "a substantial financial loss into a healthy operating profit".<ref name="Wilby2005a"/><ref name="Wilby2005b"/>

==Later career==
Wilby continues to write a weekly "First Thoughts" column for the ''Statesman''. He also writes for ''[[The Observer]]'' and ''[[The Guardian]]''.
