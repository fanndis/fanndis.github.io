It is one of the two [[Major party|major]] contemporary political parties in Germany along with the [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany]] (CDU).

Established in 1863, the SPD is by far the oldest existing political party represented in the Bundestag and was one of the first [[Marxist]]-influenced parties in the world. From the 1890s through the early 20th century, the SPD was Europe's largest Marxist party and was consistently the most popular party in Germany.<ref>Christopher R. Browning, ''The Origins of the Final Solution:  The Evolution of Nazi Jewish Policy, September 1939-March 1942'' (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 2004), p. 7.</ref> During the [[First World War]], the party split between a pro-war mainstream and the anti-war [[Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany|Independent Social Democratic Party]], of which some members went on to form the [[Communist Party of Germany]] (KPD). The SPD played a leading role in the [[German Revolution of 1918–1919]] and was chiefly responsible for the foundation of the [[Weimar Republic]]. SPD politician [[Friedrich Ebert]] served as the first [[President of Germany]] and the SPD was the strongest party until 1932. After the rise of the [[Nazi Party]] to power, it was banned in 1933 and operated in exile as the [[Sopade]].

After the [[Second World War]], the SPD was re-established. In [[East Germany]], it [[Merger of the Communist Party of Germany and the Social Democratic Party of Germany|unwillingly merged with the KPD]] to form the [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany]]. In [[West Germany]], the SPD became one of two major parties alongside the CDU/CSU. In the [[Godesberg Program]], the SPD dropped its commitment to Marxism, becoming a [[big tent]] party of the centre-left. The SPD led the federal government from 1969 to 1982 and again from 1998 to 2005. It served as a junior partner to the CDU/CSU from 1966 to 1969, 2005 to 2009 and again since 2013. [[Saskia Esken]] and [[Norbert Walter-Borjans]] have been the party's leaders since the [[2019 Social Democratic Party of Germany leadership election|2019 leadership election]]. It is the second-largest party in the [[Bundestag]] with 152 out of 709 seats, having won 20.5% of votes cast at the [[2017 German federal election|2017 federal election]]. The SPD is a junior member of the [[Fourth Merkel cabinet|federal government]] along with the [[CDU/CSU]] which was first formed after the [[2013 German federal election|2013 election]] and renewed in 2017. The SPD is a member of 11 of the 16 German [[States of Germany|state]] governments and is a leading partner in seven of them.

The SPD is a member of the [[Party of European Socialists]] and sits with the [[Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats]] group in the [[European Parliament]]. With 16 [[MEPs]], it is the third largest party in the group. The SPD was a founding member of the [[Socialist International]], but the party left in 2013 after criticising its acceptance of authoritarian parties. The SPD subsequently founded the [[Progressive Alliance]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/progressive-alliance-sozialdemokraten-gruenden-weltweites-netzwerk-a-901352.html|title=Progressive Alliance: Sozialdemokraten gründen weltweites Netzwerk|date=22 May 2013|work=[[Der Spiegel]]|location=Hamburg, Germany|accessdate=10 May 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/sozialdemokratie-progressive-alliance-gegruendet-12191286.html|title=Sozialdemokratie: "Progressive Alliance" gegründet|date=22 May 2013|work=[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]]|accessdate=10 May 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.n-tv.de/politik/SPD-gruendet-Progressive-Alliance-article10689571.html|title=Sozialistische Internationale hat ausgedient: SPD gründet "Progressive Alliance"|date=22 May 2013|accessdate=10 May 2015}}</ref> and was joined by numerous other parties around the world.

== History ==
{{main article|History of the Social Democratic Party of Germany}}
[[File:SPD Mitgliederentwicklung.svg|thumb|upright=1.15| SPD membership statistics (in thousands) since 1945]]
The SPD finds its origins in the [[General German Workers' Association]], founded in 1863, and the [[Social Democratic Workers' Party of Germany|Social Democratic Workers' Party]], founded in 1869. The two groups merged in 1875 to create the Socialist Workers' Party of Germany ({{lang|de|Sozialistische Arbeiterpartei Deutschlands}}). From 1878 to 1890, the [[Anti-Socialist Laws]] banned any grouping or meeting that aimed at spreading [[socialist]] principles, but the party still gained support in elections. In 1890, when the ban was lifted and it could again present electoral lists, the party adopted its current name. The SPD was the largest Marxist party in Europe and consistently the most popular party in German federal elections from 1890 onwards, although it was surpassed by other parties in terms of seats won in the [[Reichstag (German Empire)|Reichstag]] due to the electoral system.<ref>Christopher R. Browning, ''The Origins of the Final Solution: The Evolution of Nazi Jewish Poicy, September 1939-March 1942'' (Lincoln, NB:  University of Nebraska Press and Jerusalem: Yad Vashem, 2004), p. 7.</ref>

In the years leading up to [[World War I]], the SPD remained ideologically [[Political radicalism|radical]] in official principle, although many party officials tended to moderation in everyday politics. According to Roger Eatwell and Anthony Wright, the SPD became a party of reform, with [[social democracy]] representing "a party that strives after the socialist transformation of society by the means of democratic and economic reforms". They emphasise this development as central to understanding 20th-century social democracy, of which the SPD was a major influence.<ref>Eatwell, Roger; Wright, Anthony (1999). Contemporary Political Ideologies (2nd ed.). London: Continuum. p. 87. {{ISBN|9781855676053}}.</ref> In the [[1912 German federal election|1912 federal election]], the SPD won 34.8% of votes and finally became the largest party in the Reichstag with 110 seats, although it was still excluded from government.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://germanhistorydocs.ghi-dc.org/docpage.cfm?docpage_id=3215|title=GHDI|publisher=Nohlen & Stöver}}</ref> Despite the [[Second International]]'s agreement to oppose militarism,<ref>In, for example, the [[International Socialist Congress, Stuttgart 1907]].</ref> the SPD supported the German war effort and adopted ''[[Burgfriedenspolitik]]'', refraining from calling strikes or criticising the government.<ref>V. R. Berghahn, ''Germany and the Approach of War in 1914'' (1974) pp 178-85</ref><ref>Dieter Groh, "The 'Unpatriotic Socialists' and the State." ''Journal of Contemporary History'' 1.4 (1966): 151-177. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/259895 online].</ref> Internal opposition to the policy grew throughout the war. Anti-war members were expelled in 1916 and 1917, leading to the formation of the [[Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (USPD).<ref>Winkler, ''Der lange Weg nach Westen'', Beck Verlag Munich, 2000, p. 362</ref>

The SPD played a key role in the [[German Revolution of 1918–1919]]. On 9 November 1918, leading SPD member [[Friedrich Ebert]] was appointed Chancellor and fellow Social Democrat [[Philipp Scheidemann]] proclaimed Germany a republic.<ref>{{cite book|last=Haffner|first=Sebastian|title=Die deutsche Revolution 1918/19 (German)|publisher=Kindler|year=2002|isbn=3-463-40423-0}}</ref> The government introduced a large number of reforms in the following months, introducing various [[civil liberties]] and [[labor rights]].<ref>The Social Democratic Party of Germany 1848–2005 by Heinrich Potthoff and Susanne Miller</ref> The SPD government, committed to [[parliamentary]] [[liberal democracy]], utilised military force against uprisings involving more radical [[communist]] groups, leading to a permanent split between the SPD and the USPD (later the [[Communist Party of Germany]]).<ref>{{cite book|last1=Heiden|first1=Konrad|title=Der Fuehrer: Hitler's Rise to Power|url=https://archive.org/details/derfuehrerhitler00heid|url-access=registration|date=1944|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Company|location=Boston, MA|pages=[https://archive.org/details/derfuehrerhitler00heid/page/23 23-24]}}</ref> The SPD was the largest party during the first 13 years of the new [[Weimar Republic]]. It decisively won the [[1919 German federal election|1919 federal election]] with 37.9% of votes, and Ebert became the first [[President of Germany|President]] in February.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kolb|first=Eberhard|title=The Weimar Republic|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EZp9wxPsi_sC&pg=PA226|accessdate=10 February 2012|year=2005|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-415-34441-8|page=226}}</ref> The position of Chancellor was held by Social Democrats until the [[1920 German federal election|1920 federal election]], when the SPD lost a substantial portion of its support, falling to 22% of votes. After this, the SPD yielded the Chancellery to other parties, although it remained part of the government until 1924. Ebert died in 1925 and was succeeded by conservative [[Paul von Hindenburg]]. After making gains in the [[1928 German federal election|1928 federal election]], the SPD's [[Hermann Müller (politician)|Hermann Müller]] became Chancellor.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.deutsche-biographie.de/sfz66522.html|title=Biografie Hermann Müller(-Franken) (German)|publisher=Bayerische Nationalbibliothek|accessdate=16 December 2013}}</ref>

Germany was struck hard by the [[Great Depression]] and, unable to negotiate an effective response to the crisis, Müller resigned in 1930. The SPD was politically sidelined as the [[Nazi Party]] gained popularity and conservatives dominated the government, assisted by President von Hindenburg's frequent use of emergency powers. The ''[[Reichsbanner Schwarz-Rot-Gold]]'', the SPD's paramilitary wing, was frequently involved in violent confrontations with the Nazi [[Sturmabteilung]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Die Eiserne Front|url=http://reichsbanner.de/reichsbanner-geschichte/kampf-um-die-republik/eiserne-front/|website=reichsbanner.de|accessdate=10 October 2017}}</ref> The Nazis overtook the SPD as the largest party in [[July 1932 German federal election|July 1932]] and [[Adolf Hitler]] was appointed Chancellor in January 1933. Of the parties present in the Reichstag during the passage of the [[Enabling Act of 1933]], the SPD was the only one to vote against; most of the Communist deputies had been arrested ahead of the vote.<ref>Kitson, Alison. ''Germany, 1858–1990: Hope, Terror, and Revival'', pages 153–154 (Oxford U. Press 2001).</ref> The SPD was formally banned in June.

In exile, the party used the name [[Sopade]].<ref>William Shirer, ''The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich'' (Touchstone Edition) (New York: Simon & Schuster, 1990)</ref>

After the end of [[World War II]], the re-establishment of the SPD was permitted in the [[Allied-occupied Germany|Western occupation zones]] in 1945. In the [[Soviet occupation zone]], the SPD was forcibly merged with the Communist Party in 1946 to form the [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany]] (SED). The SED became the ruling party of [[East Germany]] until 1989.<ref>Entscheidung für die SED 1946 – ein Verrat an sozialdemokratischen Idealen?, in: ''[[Jahrbuch für Forschungen zur Geschichte der Arbeiterbewegung]]'', No. I/2004.</ref> In [[West Germany]], the SPD became one of two major parties, alongside the Christian Democratic Union (CDU). In the inaugural [[1949 West German federal election|1949 federal election]], it placed second with 29.2% of votes and led the opposition to the CDU government.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bundeswahlleiter.de/en/bundestagswahlen/fruehere_bundestagswahlen/btw1949.html|publisher=Federal Returning Officer}}</ref> In its 1959 [[Godesberg Program]], the party dropped its commitment to Marxism and sought to appeal to [[middle-class]] voters, becoming a [[big tent]] party of the [[centre-left]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://germanhistorydocs.ghi-dc.org/pdf/eng/Parties%20WZ%203%20ENG%20FINAL.pdf|title=Godesberg Program in English (PDF)|publisher=German History Documents}}</ref>

After 17 years in opposition, the SPD became the junior partner in a [[Grand coalition (Germany)|grand coalition]] with the CDU/CSU which lasted from 1966 to 1969. After the [[1969 West German federal election|1969 federal election]], the SPD's [[Willy Brandt]] became Chancellor in a coalition with the liberal [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] (FDP). His government sought to normalise relations with East Germany and the [[Eastern Bloc]], a policy known as ''[[Ostpolitik]]''.<ref>Hofmann, Arne. ''The emergence of détente in Europe: Brandt, Kennedy and the formation of Ostpolitik.'' (Routledge, 2007).</ref> The party achieved its best ever result of 45.8% in [[1972 West German federal election|1972]], one of only three occasions in which it formed the largest [[Bundestag]] faction.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bundeswahlleiter.de/en/bundestagswahlen/fruehere_bundestagswahlen/btw1972.html|publisher=Federal Returning Officer}}</ref> After Brandt's resignation in 1974, his successor [[Helmut Schmidt]] served as Chancellor until 1982, when the SPD returned to opposition.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bundestag.de/dokumente/textarchiv/2012/40797914_kw40_misstrauensvotum_kalenderblatt/209576|title=Deutscher Bundestag – Das Misstrauensvotum gegen Helmut Schmidt|author=Jan Eisel|date=28 September 2012}}</ref> During the [[Peaceful Revolution]] in East Germany, the [[Social Democratic Party in the GDR|East German SPD]] was refounded.

== Party platform ==
The SPD was established as a [[Marxism|Marxist]] party in 1875. However, the Social Democrats underwent a major shift in policies reflected in the differences between the Heidelberg Program of 1925 which called for "the transformation of the capitalist system of private ownership of the means of production to social ownership"<ref>Brustein, William (1996). ''Logic of Evil: The Social Origins of the Nazi Party 1925–1933''. New Haven, Connecticut: Yale University Press. p. 131.</ref> and the [[Godesberg Program]] of 1959 which aimed to broaden its voter base and move its political position toward the centre.<ref>Cooper, Alice Holmes. ''Paradoxes of Peace: German Peace Movements since 1945''. Ann Arbor, Michigan: University of Michigan Press. p. 85.</ref> After [[World War II]], the SPD under the leadership of [[Kurt Schumacher]] re-established itself as a socialist party representing the interests of the [[working class]] and the [[trade union]]s. With the Godesberg Program, the party evolved from a socialist working-class party to a modern social-democratic party working within liberal capitalism. The SPD's latest Hamburg Programme of 2007 describes [[democratic socialism]] as "an order of economy, state and society in which the civil, political, social and economic fundamental rights are guaranteed for all people, all people live a life without exploitation, oppression and violence, that is in social and human security" and as a "vision of a free, just and solidary society", the realization of which is emphasized as a "permanent task". [[Social democracy]] serves as the "principle of action".<ref>Social Democratic Party of Germany (28 October 2007).

The current [[party platform]] of the SPD espouses the goal of [[social democracy]], which is seen as a vision of a societal arrangement in which [[freedom]] and [[social justice]] are paramount. According to the party platform, [[Political freedom|freedom]], [[justice]] and [[social solidarity]] form the basis of social democracy. The coordinated [[social market economy]] should be strengthened and its output should be distributed fairly. The party sees that economic system as necessary in order to ensure the affluence of the entire population. The SPD also tries to protect the society's poor with a [[welfare state]]. Concurrently, it advocates a sustainable [[fiscal policy]] that does not place a burden on future generations while eradicating budget deficits. In [[social policy]], the Social Democrats stand for [[civil and political rights]] in an [[open society]]. In [[foreign policy]], the party aims at ensuring global peace by balancing global interests with democratic means and [[European integration]] is one of the main priorities of the party. The SPD supports economic regulations to limit potential losses for banks and people. They support a common European economic and financial policy and to prevent speculative bubbles as well as environmentally sustainable growth.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spd.de/themen/76382/unser_europa.html;jsessionid=B478975DB326963FC52815B6169D48E1|title=Archived copy|accessdate=28 October 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121029102124/http://www.spd.de/themen/76382/unser_europa.html|archivedate=29 October 2012}} </ref>

=== Internal factions ===
The SPD is mostly composed of members belonging to either of the two main wings, namely the [[Keynesian economics|Keynesian]] social democrats and [[Third Way (Centrism)|Third Way]] 'moderate' social democrats belonging to the [[Seeheimer Kreis]]. While the more moderate Seeheimer Kreis generally support the [[Agenda 2010]] programs introduced by Chancellor [[Gerhard Schröder]], the Keynesian social democrats continue to defend classical left-wing policies and the welfare state. The classical left-wing of the SPD claims that in recent years the welfare state has been curtailed through reform programs such as the Agenda 2010, [[Hartz concept|Hartz IV]] and the more [[economic liberal]] stance of the SPD which were endorsed by centrist social democrats.<ref name="Centrist">{{cite web|first=Jeremy|last=Cliffe|url=https://www.newstatesman.com/world/europe/2019/12/spd-s-new-left-wing-leadership-could-prove-just-jolt-germany-needs|title=The SPD's new left-wing leadership could prove just the jolt Germany needs|publisher=[[New Statesman America]]|date=1 December 2019}}</ref><ref name="Left-wing">{{cite web|first=Ben|last=Knight|url=https://www.dw.com/en/collectivization-remarks-split-german-social-democrats/a-48578188|title=Collectivization remarks split German Social Democrats|publisher=[[Deutsche Welle]]|date=2 May 2019}}</ref> As a reaction to the Agenda 2010, there was in 2005 the ascension of an inner party dissident movement which led ultimately to the foundation of the new party [[Labour and Social Justice – The Electoral Alternative]] (''Arbeit & soziale Gerechtigkeit – Die Wahlalternative'', WASG). The WASG was later merged into [[The Left (Germany)|The Left]] (''Die Linke'') in 2007.<ref>Nils Schnelle (2007). ''Die WASG – Von der Gründung bis zur geplanten Fusion mit der Linkspartei''. Munich.</ref>

== Base of support ==
=== Social structure ===
Before World War II, as the main non-revolutionary left-wing party the Social Democrats fared best among non-[[Catholic]] workers as well as intellectuals favouring [[Social progressivism|social progressive]] causes and increased economic equality. Led by [[Kurt Schumacher]] after World War II, the SPD initially opposed both the [[social market economy]] and [[Konrad Adenauer]]'s drive towards Western integration fiercely, but after Schumacher's death it accepted the social market economy and Germany's position in the Western alliance in order to appeal to a broader range of voters. It still remains associated with the economic causes of unionised employees and working class voters. In the 1990s, the left and moderate wings of the party drifted apart, culminating in a secession of a significant number of party members which later joined the socialist party [[Labour and Social Justice – The Electoral Alternative|WASG]], which later merged into [[The Left (Germany)|The Left]] (''Die Linke'').

=== Geographic distribution ===
[[File:Btw17spd.svg|thumb|upright|[[2017 German federal election|2017 federal election]] SPD results]]
Geographically, much of the SPD's current-day support comes from large cities, especially of northern and western Germany and [[Berlin]]. As of 2019, 10 of the country's 15 biggest cities are led by SPD mayors. The metropolitan area of the [[Ruhr Area]], where [[coal mining]] and [[steel]] production were once the biggest sources of revenues, have provided a significant base for the SPD in the 20th century. In the [[Bremen (state)|Free Hanseatic City of Bremen]], the SPD has governed without interruption since 1949. In southern Germany, the SPD typically garners less support except in the largest cities. At the [[2009 German federal election|2009 federal election]], the party lost its only constituency in the entire state of [[Bavaria]] (in [[Munich]]). 

Small town and rural support comes especially from the traditionally [[Protestantism|Protestant]] areas of northern Germany and [[Brandenburg]] (with notable exceptions such as [[Western Pomerania]] where CDU leader [[Angela Merkel]] has her constituency) and a number of university towns. A striking example of the general pattern is the traditionally Catholic [[Emsland]], where the Social Democrats generally gain a low percentage of votes, whereas the [[Reformed churches|Reformed Protestant]] region of [[East Frisia]] directly to the north, with its strong traditional streak of [[anti-Catholicism]], is one of their strongest constituencies. Further south, the SPD also enjoys solid support in northern [[Hesse]], parts of [[Palatinate (region)|Palatinate]] and the [[Saarland]]. The social democrats are weakest in the south-eastern states of Bavaria, [[Saxony]] and [[Thuringia]], where the party's percentage of votes dropped to single-digit figures in the 2018 and 2019 elections.

== Election results ==
[[File:German parliamentary elections diagram de.svg|thumb|upright|Election results and governments since 1949]]

=== General German elections ===
The SPD, at times called SAPD, participated in general elections determining the members of parliament. For the elections until 1933, the parliament was called Reichstag, except of the one of 1919 which was called the National Assembly and since 1949 the parliament is called Bundestag. Note that changes in borders (1871, 1919, 1920, 1949, 1957 and 1990) varied the number of eligible voters whereas electoral laws also changed the ballot system (only constituencies until 1912, only party lists until 1949 and a mixed system thereafter), the suffrage (women vote since 1919; minimum active voting age was 25 till 1918, 20 till 1946, 21 till 1972 and 18 since), the number of seats (fixed or flexible) and the length of the legislative period (three or four years). The list begins after the SPD was formed in 1875, when labour parties unified to only form the SPD (then SAPD, current name since 1890).
