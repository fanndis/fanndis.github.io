'''Thomas Baptiste Morello''' (born May 30, 1964) is an American musician, singer, songwriter, actor, and political activist. He is best known for his tenure with the [[Rock music|rock]] band [[Rage Against the Machine]] and then with [[Audioslave]]. Between 2016 and 2019, Morello was a member of the [[supergroup (music)|supergroup]] [[Prophets of Rage]]. Morello was also a touring musician with [[Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ultimateclassicrock.com/tom-morello-interview-springsteen-high-hopes-2014/|title=Exclusive: Tom Morello on Touring and Recording with Bruce Springsteen|website=Ultimate Classic Rock}}</ref> He is also known for his acoustic solo act, [[the Nightwatchman]], and [[Street Sweeper Social Club]]. Morello also co-founded [[Axis of Justice]], which airs a monthly program on [[Pacifica Radio]] station [[KPFK]] (90.7 FM) in Los Angeles.

Born in [[Harlem, New York]], and raised in [[Libertyville, Illinois]], Morello became interested in music and politics while in high school. He attended [[Harvard University]] and earned a Bachelor of Arts degree from the [[Committee on Degrees in Social Studies]]. After his previous band [[Lock Up (American band)|Lock Up]] disbanded, Morello met [[Zack de la Rocha]]. The two founded Rage Against the Machine together, going on to become one of the most popular and influential rock acts of the 1990s.

He is best known for his unique and creative guitar playing style, which incorporates feedback noise, unconventional picking, and [[tapping]], as well as heavy use of guitar effects. Morello is also known for his socialist political views and activism; creating the Nightwatchman offered an outlet for his views while playing apolitical music with Audioslave. He was ranked number 40 in ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine's list of the "100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time".<ref name="rolling-stone-100-greatest-guitarists">{{cite magazine | url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-greatest-guitarists-20111123/tom-morello-20111122 | title=100 Greatest Guitarists | magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] | date=November 23, 2011 | accessdate=November 23, 2015 |author1=Browne, David |author2=Doyle, Patrick |author3=Fricke, David |author4=Hermes, Will |author5=Hiatt, Brian |author6=Light, Alan |author7=Tannenbaum, Rob |author8=Wolk, Douglas }}</ref>

==Early life==
Morello was born on May 30, 1964, in [[Harlem, New York]], to [[Ngethe Njoroge]] and [[Mary Morello]]. Morello, an only child, is the son of an American mother of Italian and Irish descent and a [[Kikuyu people|Kikuyu Kenyan]] father. His mother was a schoolteacher from [[Marseilles, Illinois]], who earned a [[Master of Arts]] at [[Loyola University, Chicago]] and traveled to Germany, Spain, Japan, and Kenya as an English language teacher between 1977 and 1983.<ref name="aof_episode_06">{{cite web|title= The Mary Morello and Cindy Sheehan Show| at=episode 6|publisher=Axis of Justice|date=August 6, 2007|url=http://www.axisofjustice.org/MM_080607.htm|accessdate=January 9, 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071211052444/http://www.axisofjustice.org/MM_080607.htm|archivedate=December 11, 2007}}</ref>

His father, [[Ngethe Njoroge]], participated in the [[Mau Mau Uprising]] (1952–1960) and was Kenya's first [[Permanent Representative to the United Nations|ambassador to the United Nations]].<ref name="rage">{{cite book|title=Rage Against the Machine|last=Devenish|first=Colin|year=2001|publisher=[[St. Martin's Press]]|isbn=0-312-27326-6|page=13}}</ref> Morello's paternal great-uncle, [[Jomo Kenyatta]], was the first elected president of Kenya.<ref name="rage"/> His aunt, [[Jemimah Gecaga]], was the first woman to serve in the legislature of Kenya; and his uncle [[Njoroge Mungai]] was a Kenyan Cabinet Minister, Member of Parliament, and was considered one of the founding fathers of modern Kenya. His parents met in August 1963 while attending a pro-democracy protest in [[Nairobi, Kenya]].<ref name="oneman">[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/tom-matlack/tom-morello-one-man-revol_b_245035.html Tom Morello:One Man Revolt] by ''[[The Huffington Post]]'', July 21, 2009</ref> After discovering her pregnancy, Mary returned to the United States with Njoroge in November and married in New York City.<ref>{{Cite web|title=My Life Story: Tom Morello|url=https://www.loudersound.com/features/my-life-story-tom-morello|last=November 2006|first=Malcolm Dome01|website=Metal Hammer Magazine|language=en|access-date=2020-05-24}}</ref>

When Morello was 16 months old, Njoroge returned to his native Kenya and denied his paternity of his son.<ref name="oneman"/><ref name="phoenix_nt_1996">{{cite web|last=Holthouse|first=David|title=Bottled Anger ''Rage Against the Machine guitarist Tom Morello pours forth the vitriol''|website=Phoenix New Times|date=September 26, 1996|url=http://search.phoenixnewtimes.com/1996-09-26/music/bottled-anger|accessdate=January 9, 2008}}</ref> Morello was raised by his mother in [[Libertyville, Illinois]] and attended [[Libertyville High School]], where his mother was a U.S. history teacher. She was the homeroom teacher for Morello's classmate and fellow guitarist [[Adam Jones (musician)|Adam Jones]], later of the band [[Tool (band)|Tool]]. Morello sang in the school choir and was active in speech and drama club; a prominent role was [[Oberon]] in ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]''.

{{anchor|highschool}}Morello developed left-leaning political proclivities early, and has described himself as having been "the only anarchist in a conservative high school", and has since identified as a nonsectarian socialist. In the 1980 mock elections at Libertyville, he campaigned for a fictitious anarchist "candidate" named Hubie Maxwell, who came in fourth place in the election. He also wrote a piece headlined "South Africa: Racist Fascism That We Support" for the school alternative newspaper, ''The Student Pulse''.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

{{anchor|harvard}}Morello graduated from high school with honors in June 1982 and enrolled at [[Harvard University]] as a [[political science]] student that autumn. Morello graduated in 1986 with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in [[social studies]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cjZzoSz2bw |title=Tom Morello: From Harvard to Hollywood |publisher=YouTube |date=June 16, 2009 |accessdate=July 18, 2011}}</ref> He moved to [[Los Angeles]], where he supported himself, first by working as a stripper.<ref name="Tom Morello Used To Be A Stripper">{{cite web|last=Harper|first=Kate|url=http://www.chartattack.com/news/76346/tom-morello-used-to-be-a-stripper |title=Tom Morello Used To Be A Stripper|website=Chartattack.com|date=November 3, 2009|accessdate=November 15, 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100826122644/http://www.chartattack.com/news/76346/tom-morello-used-to-be-a-stripper|archivedate=August 26, 2010}}</ref><blockquote>"When I graduated from Harvard and moved to Hollywood, I was unemployable. I was literally starving, so I had to work menial labor and, at one point, I even worked as an exotic dancer. 'Brick House' (by [[the Commodores]]) was my jam!

{{anchor|cranston}}From 1987 to 1988, Morello worked in the office of United States Senator [[Alan Cranston]] (D-CA);<ref name="Tom Morello Used To Be A Stripper"/> however, this proved to be a negative experience for Morello, who decided never to pursue a career in politics.<blockquote>"I never had any real desire to work in politics but if there was any ember burning in me, it was extinguished working in that job because of two things: one of them was the fact that 80 per cent of the time I spent with the Senator, he was on the phone asking rich people for money. It just made me understand that the whole business was dirty. He had to compromise his entire being every day. The other was the time a woman phoned up to the office and wanted to complain that there were Mexicans moving into her neighborhood. I said to her, 'Ma'am, you're a damn racist', and she was indignant. I thought I was representing our cause well, but I got yelled at for a week by everyone for saying that! I thought to myself that if I'm in a job where I can't call a damn racist a damn racist, then it's not for me."<ref name="Tom Morello Used To Be A Stripper"/></blockquote>

== Musical influences ==
At age 13, Morello joined his first band, a cover band called Nebula, as the lead singer; Nebula covered material by bands including [[Led Zeppelin]], [[Steve Miller Band]], and [[Bachman–Turner Overdrive]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLZ0OTtPimI|title=Tom Morello - Wikipedia: Fact or Fiction?|last=Loudwire|date=October 17, 2018|accessdate=November 27, 2018|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}</ref> At this same age, Morello purchased his first guitar. Around 1982, Morello first started studying the guitar seriously. He had formed a band in the same year called the Electric Sheep, featuring future [[Tool (band)|Tool]] guitarist Adam Jones on bass.<ref name="rage"/> He wrote original material for the band that included politically charged lyrics. He has said that he was profoundly influenced by [[Run-D.M.C]], and [[Jam Master Jay]] in particular. This influence can be heard in songs like "[[Bulls on Parade]]" where his guitar solos mimic a DJ scratching. Additionally, the [[The Bomb Squad|Bomb Squad]] and [[Public Enemy (group)|Public Enemy]] has had a large impact on his musical style.

At the time, Morello's musical tastes lay in the direction of hard rock and heavy metal, particularly [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]] and [[Iron Maiden]]. As he stated in ''[[Iron Maiden: Flight 666|Flight 666]]'', he is a huge fan of ''[[Piece of Mind]]'', [[Alice Cooper]], [[Led Zeppelin]], and [[Black Sabbath]]. He cited [[Tony Iommi]] of Black Sabbath as one of his biggest influences as a riff writer.<ref>Jon Wiederhorn, Katherine Turman, ''Louder Than Hell: The Definitive Oral History of Metal'', HarperCollins, 2013</ref> Morello developed his own unique sound through the electric guitar. Later, his musical style and politics were greatly influenced by punk rock bands like [[the Clash]], [[the Sex Pistols]], and [[Devo]], and artists such as [[Bruce Springsteen]] and [[Bob Dylan]].

==Recording career==

===Rage Against the Machine (1991–2000; 2007–2011, 2019-present)===
{{Main|Rage Against the Machine}}
In 1991, Morello was looking to form a new band after Lock Up disbanded. Morello was impressed by [[Zack de la Rocha]]'s freestyle rapping and asked him to join his band. He also drafted drummer [[Brad Wilk]], who he knew from Lock Up, where Wilk unsuccessfully auditioned for a drumming spot. The band's lineup was completed when Zack convinced his childhood friend [[Tim Commerford]] to play bass. After frequenting the L.A. club circuit, Rage Against the Machine signed a record deal with [[Epic Records]] in 1992. That same year, the band released their [[Rage Against the Machine (album)|self titled debut]]. They achieved a considerable amount of mainstream success and released three more studio albums.

In August 2000 in Los Angeles during the Democratic National Convention, Rage Against the Machine performed outside the [[Staples Center]] to a crowd numbering in the thousands while the Convention took place inside.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/rageagainstthemachine/articles/story/5923647/rage_wage_battle_of_los_angeles_at_dnc |title= Rage Wage Battle of Los Angeles at DNC  |accessdate=December 16, 2008 |last= Asch |first= Andrew |date= August 15, 2000 |work=Rolling Stone }}</ref> After several audience members began to throw rocks, the Los Angeles Police Department turned off the power and ordered the audience to disperse, firing rubber bullets and pepper spray into the crowd.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://edition.cnn.com/2000/ALLPOLITICS/stories/08/15/campaign.protests/index.html |title= Thousands take to the streets outside Democratic convention |accessdate=December 16, 2008 |date= August 15, 2000 |publisher= CNN|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070311040905/http://edition.cnn.com/2000/ALLPOLITICS/stories/08/15/campaign.protests/index.html |archivedate = March 11, 2007}}</ref>

[[File:tommorello01.jpg|thumb|left|Morello performing with [[Rage Against the Machine]] at the [[Reading festival#2008|2008 Reading Festival]]]]

In late 2000, amid disagreements on the band's direction and [[MTV Video Music Awards#2000s|Commerford's stunt at the VMA's]], the disgruntled de la Rocha quit the band. On September 13, 2000, Rage Against the Machine performed their last concert at the [[Grand Olympic Auditorium]] in Los Angeles. Although Rage Against the Machine officially disbanded in October 2000, their fourth studio album, ''[[Renegades (Rage Against the Machine album)|Renegades]]'', became a collection of cover songs from artists such as [[Bob Dylan]], [[MC5]], [[Bruce Springsteen]] and [[Cypress Hill]]. 2003 saw the release of their last album, titled ''[[Live at the Grand Olympic Auditorium]]'', an edited recording of the band's final two concerts on September 12 and 13, 2000 at the Grand Olympic Auditorium in Los Angeles. It was accompanied by an expanded DVD release of the last show and included a previously unreleased music video for "Bombtrack".

After disbanding, Morello, Wilk, and Commerford went on to form Audioslave with then-former [[Soundgarden]] singer [[Chris Cornell]] and released three albums and a DVD from the band's concert in Cuba. De la Rocha started working on a solo album collaboration with [[DJ Shadow]], [[Company Flow]], and [[the Roots]]' [[Questlove]], but the project was dropped in favor of working with [[Nine Inch Nails]]' [[Trent Reznor]]. Recording was completed, but the album will probably never be released.<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=February 11, 2009|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1501617/20050510/reznor_trent.jhtml|title=Reznor Says Collabos With De La Rocha, Keenan May Never Surface|publisher=MTV News}}</ref> So far, only two tracks have been released: "We Want It All" was featured on "Songs and Artists that Inspired [[Fahrenheit 9/11]]", and "Digging For Windows" was released as a single.

====Reunion====
{{Main|Rage Against the Machine reunion tour}}
On April 29, 2007, Rage Against the Machine reunited at the [[Coachella Music Festival]]. The band played in front of an [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation|EZLN]] backdrop to the largest crowds of the festival. The performance was initially thought to be a one-off, but this turned out not to be the case. The band played seven more shows in the United States in 2007 (including their first non-festival concert in seven years at the [[Alpine Valley Music Theater]] in [[East Troy, Wisconsin]]), and in January 2008, they played their first shows outside the US since re-forming as part of the [[Big Day Out]] Festival in Australia and New Zealand. In August 2008 they headlined nights at the Reading and Leeds festivals.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,23082231-5006786,00.html|title=Silverchair in an even bigger day out |accessdate=November 12, 2008 |last= Shedden |first= Iain |date= January 21, 2008 |work=The Australian}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://tvnz.co.nz/view/page/423466/1548409 |title= BDO revellers get ready for heat |accessdate=November 12, 2008 |date= January 18, 2008 |publisher= [[Television New Zealand]]}}</ref>

The band has since continued to tour around the world, headlining many large festivals in Europe and the United States, including [[Lollapalooza]] in Chicago. In 2008 the band also played shows in [[Denver, Colorado]] and [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]] to coincide with the [[2008 Democratic National Convention|Democratic National Convention]] and [[2008 Republican National Convention|Republican National Convention]], respectively. In July 2011, Rage Against the Machine played at L.A. Rising, a concert formed by the band in Los Angeles, in which they headlined and played with other artists including [[Muse (band)|Muse]] and [[Rise Against]].

On November 1, 2019, it was reported that Rage Against the Machine were reuniting for their first shows in nine years in the spring of 2020, including two appearances at that year's [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival]].<ref name="forbesreunion">{{cite web|first=Steve|last=Baltin|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevebaltin/2019/11/01/confirmed-rage-against-the-machine-to-reunite-in-2020-headline-coachella/#25bcbbac12b1|title=Confirmed: Rage Against The Machine To Reunite In 2020, Headline Coachella|website=Forbes|date=November 1, 2019|accessdate=November 1, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|first=Graham|last=Hartmann|url=https://loudwire.com/rage-against-the-machine-2020-reunion-rumors/|title=Rage Against the Machine Announce 2020 Reunion|website=Loudwire|date=November 1, 2019|accessdate=November 1, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|first=Dave|last=Brooks|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/rock/8542057/rage-against-the-machine-reuniting-2020-coachella|title=Rage Against the Machine to Reunite for 2020 Coachella|website=Billboard|date=November 1, 2019|accessdate=November 1, 2019}}</ref> The summer 2020 planned tour was postponed due to the [[COVID-19 pandemic in the United States|COVID-19 pandemic]].

===Audioslave (2001–2007, 2017)===
{{Main|Audioslave}}
[[File:Tom Morello Montreux Jazz Festival 2005.jpg|thumb|170px|Morello with [[Audioslave]] at the [[Montreux Jazz Festival]] in 2005.]]
After de la Rocha left Rage Against the Machine, the remaining bandmates began collaborating with former [[Soundgarden]] vocalist [[Chris Cornell]] at the suggestion of producer [[Rick Rubin]]. The new group was first rumored to be called the Civilian Project, but the name Audioslave was confirmed before their first album was released.

The band released their eponymous debut album on November 19, 2002. It was a critical and commercial success, attaining triple-platinum status.

The band released their second album, ''[[Out of Exile]]'', on May 24, 2005. It debuted at number 1 on the Billboard charts and attained platinum status. In the same year, they released a DVD documenting their trip as the first American rock band to play a free show in Cuba. The band's third album, ''[[Revelations (Audioslave album)|Revelations]]'', was released in the fall of 2006. As of February 15, 2007, Audioslave have broken up as a result of frontman Cornell's departure due to "irresolvable personality conflicts". The band reunited with Zack de la Rocha and resumed their previous band, Rage Against the Machine.

Audioslave reunited for only one show in January 2017, and there were talks about a reunion tour. However, Chris Cornell's death on May 18, 2017 eliminated such possibility.

===The Nightwatchman (2003–present)===
{{Main|The Nightwatchman}}
Morello writes and performs [[folk music]] under the alias the Nightwatchman. He has explained:

{{quote|"The Nightwatchman is my political folk alter ego. I've been writing these songs and playing them at open mic nights with friends for some time. This is the first time I've toured with it. When I play open mic nights, it's announced as The Nightwatchman. There will be kids there who are fans of my electric guitar playing, and you see them there scratching their heads.

But it's something that I enjoy doing. I look at it more as an extension of my politics. Then again, some of the songs are not explicitly political. It really helped me grow as an artist and songwriter. Once you prick the vein you never know what is going to come out. You could aim for all union songs and you find yourself in other territory."}}

In November 2003 the Nightwatchman joined artists [[Billy Bragg]], [[Lester Chambers]] of [[the Chambers Brothers]], [[Steve Earle]], [[Jill Sobule]], [[Boots Riley]] of [[the Coup]] and [[Mike Mills]] of [[R.E.M.]] on the Tell Us the Truth Tour. The thirteen-city tour was supported by unions, environmental and media reform groups including Common Cause, Free Press and A.F.L.-C.I.O. with the ultimate goal of "informing music fans, and exposing and challenging the failures of the major media outlets in the United States."<ref>{{cite web| last1=Portner |first1=Matt |last2=Heller |first2=Sarah |url=http://www.thestudentunderground.org/article.php?id=91&issue=46 |title=Tell Us the Truth Tour |work=The Boston Underground |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071113020551/http://www.thestudentunderground.org/article.php?id=91&issue=46 |archive-date=November 13, 2007 |access-date=December 14, 2007}}</ref> Morello explained: <blockquote> "Media consolidation needs smashing and globalization needs unmasking. When presidents and politicians lie, it is the job of the press to expose those lies. When the press fails, the gangstas come out from hiding. The lie becomes the law. The point of the Tell Us the Truth Tour is to help others make connections, and to show them that activism can change the policies of this country."<ref>{{cite web |last=Nichols |first=John |url=http://www.thenation.com/blogs/thebeat?pid=1069 |title=Tell Us The Truth! |work=The Nation |access-date=14 December 2007}}</ref>
</blockquote>

One of his many songs, "No One Left", which compares the aftermath of [[September 11, 2001 attacks|September 11]] to that of a U.S. attack on Iraq, appears on the album ''[[Songs and Artists that Inspired Fahrenheit 9/11]]''.

The Nightwatchman also appeared on the album/DVD ''[[Axis Of Justice: Concert Series Volume 1]]'', contributing the songs "Until the End", "The Road I Must Travel", and "Union Song".

Morello, as the Nightwatchman, released his debut solo album, ''[[One Man Revolution]]'', on April 24, 2007.

The Nightwatchman joined the [[Dave Matthews Band]] for its short European tour in May 2007. As well as opening for the Dave Matthews Band, he was invited to guest on a couple of songs each night. The last night of this Morello/DMB arrangement was May 30, 2007 at [[Wembley Arena]] in London, on Morello's birthday.

The Nightwatchman is currently supporting [[Ben Harper]] on tour. During this tour, Morello has been joining Harper onstage for a cover of [[Bob Dylan]]'s "[[Masters of War]]", on which he plays the electric guitar in the style for which he's best known.

Morello has presided over a [[Hotel Café]] residency in L.A. since November 2007, which has featured many of his musical cohorts, including Serj Tankian, [[Perry Farrell]], [[Jon Foreman]] of [[Switchfoot]], [[Shooter Jennings]], [[Nuno Bettencourt]], [[Sen Dog]] of Cypress Hill, [[Jill Sobule]], [[Boots Riley]], [[Alexi Murdoch]], [[Wayne Kramer (guitarist)|Wayne Kramer]] of [[MC5]] and others.

On October 10, 2008, the Nightwatchman appeared on ''[[The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson]] as a musical guest, promoting his new album ''[[The Fabled City]]''.

On December 17, 2011, Morello performed a live set for "[[Guitar Center]] Sessions" on [[DirecTV]]. The episode included an interview with program host, [[Nic Harcourt]].<ref>[http://sessions.guitarcenter.com/tom-morello/ Guitar Center Sessions with host Nic Harcourt] Retrieved October 18, 2013.</ref>

On February 2, 2019, Morello made a guest appearance at the Foo Fighters pre-Super Bowl 53 concert in Atlanta, along with Zac Brown, for a cover of Black Sabbath's “War Pigs”.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/foo-fighters-super-bowl-atlanta-concert-789252/|title=See Foo Fighters Perform Black Sabbath Classic With Zac Brown, Tom Morello|last=Kreps|first=Daniel|date=2019-02-03|website=Rolling Stone|language=en-US|access-date=2019-02-04}}</ref>

Morello, as the Night Watchman, contributed a version of "Blind Willie McTell" on the "Chimes Of Freedom: The Songs Of Bob Dylan Honoring 50 Years Of Amnesty International" tribute album released in 2012.

=== Street Sweeper Social Club (2006–present) ===
{{Main|Street Sweeper Social Club}}
Following Audioslave's breakup in 2007, Morello met up with [[Boots Riley]] of [[the Coup]], suggesting that they start a band which Morello had named Street Sweeper. After giving Riley a tape of various songs to write to, the two created the duo Street Sweeper Social Club.

Street Sweeper Social Club opened for Nine Inch Nails and Jane's Addiction in May 2009.

=== Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band (2008–2015) ===
{{Main|Bruce Springsteen}}

In April 2008, Morello made two guest appearances with [[Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band]] at the [[Honda Center]] in Anaheim. They performed an extended electric version, featuring guitar solos, of "[[The Ghost of Tom Joad (song)|The Ghost of Tom Joad]]" (which had previously been covered by Rage Against the Machine on ''[[Renegades (Rage Against the Machine album)|Renegades]]''). One of these performance was included on Springsteen's ''[[Magic Tour Highlights]]'' EP as an audio track or video download.

On October 29, 2009, Morello performed at the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame#25th anniversary concert|25th Anniversary Rock & Roll Hall of Fame Concert]] at [[Madison Square Garden]]. He performed "The Ghost of Tom Joad", "[[London Calling (song)|London Calling]]", "[[Badlands (Bruce Springsteen song)|Badlands]]", and "[[(Your Love Keeps Lifting Me) Higher and Higher]]" with Springsteen and the E Street Band.

Morello appears on two songs on Springsteen's 2012 album ''[[Wrecking Ball (Bruce Springsteen album)|Wrecking Ball]]''. He joined Springsteen, the E Street Band, and [[the Roots]] on ''[[Late Night with Jimmy Fallon]]'' to preview the album prior to its release. On December 4, 2012, Morello again joined Springsteen and the E Street Band for five songs during a concert in Anaheim.<ref>{{cite news|last=Wener|first=Ben|title=Bruce Springsteen turns in an epic in Anaheim|url=http://www.ocregister.com/entertainment/one-379719-night-springsteen.html|accessdate=December 5, 2012|newspaper=The OC Register}}</ref>

On January 17, 2013, it was announced that Morello would temporarily join Springsteen and the E Street Band on the March 2013 Australian leg of their ''[[Wrecking Ball Tour]]'', filling in for longtime E Street Band guitarist [[Steve Van Zandt]], who had scheduling conflicts filming the TV series ''[[Lilyhammer]]'' in [[Norway]]. During the tour, Morello joined the band in the studio to record new music.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/tom-morello-to-join-bruce-springsteen-on-australian-tour-20130117|title=Tom Morello to Join Bruce Springsteen on Tour|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]}}</ref>

The material Morello recorded with Springsteen appeared on Springsteen's 18th studio album, ''[[High Hopes (Bruce Springsteen album)|High Hopes]]'', which was released in January 2014. Morello appears on eight of the album's 11 tracks and shares lead vocals with Springsteen on a re-recording of "The Ghost of Tom Joad". It was Morello who originally suggested that Springsteen perform the [[High Hopes (Bruce Springsteen song)|title track]] during a concert for the first time in March 2013. Springsteen had previously recorded the song in 1995, and the 2013 performance led to its re-recording, which subsequently developed into the album of the same name. Springsteen heavily credits Morello as being a major inspiration for the album by saying he was "my muse" and "he pushed the rest of this project to another level". Morello subsequently appeared alongside Springsteen and the E Street Band during a January 2014 appearance on ''Late Night with Jimmy Fallon'' and then on the ensuing ''[[High Hopes Tour]]'' which came to an end in May 2014. With Springsteen taking the remainder of the year off from touring, it is unknown if Morello will be involved in the touring lineup when Springsteen decides to tour again.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://brucespringsteen.net/news/2013/bruce-onhigh-hopes|title=Bruce on 'High Hopes'|website=Brucespringsteen.net}}</ref> Springsteen announced on December 4, 2015 that his upcoming ''[[The River Tour 2016]]'' would be downsizing the touring lineup and would not include Morello.

Morello made a surprise appearance during Springsteen and the E Street Band's ''The River Tour 2016'' show on August 25, 2016, at [[MetLife Stadium]] in [[New Jersey]], where he joined them on "[[Death to My Hometown]]", "[[American Skin (41 Shots)]]", "The Ghost of Tom Joad" and "Badlands".

==Guitar playing technique==
Morello is famed for his guitar style, which consists of [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]]/[[punk music|punk]] hybrid [[riff]]s and [[hip hop music|hip hop]]-inspired sounds. A 1993 ''[[Melody Maker]]'' live review of a Rage Against The Machine gig, said "Guitarist Tom Morello wears his guitar high up to wring every sound out of it. Falling bombs, police sirens, scratching - he can do them all."<ref>Melody Maker - May 29, 1993 issue</ref>

To produce his guitar sounds, Morello chooses various effects pedals. During his tenure in RATM, he used a [[Dunlop Cry Baby]], a [[DigiTech Whammy|DigiTech WH-1 Whammy]], a [[Boss Corporation|Boss]] DD-2 Digital Delay, a DOD EQ pedal (set flat and just used to boost the volume during guitar solos or particular rocking moments), and an Ibanez DFL Flanger. Around the time of ''[[The Battle of Los Angeles (album)|The Battle of Los Angeles]]'' he added a Boss TR-2 Tremolo pedal (which can be heard on "Guerrilla Radio"). For Audioslave, Morello replaced the Ibanez Flanger with an [[MXR Phase 90]]. His amplifier of choice has always been a 50-watt [[Marshall Amplification|Marshall]] JCM 800 2205 and a [[Peavey Electronics|Peavey]] 4x12 cabinet. While the Marshall amplifier has two channels, he only uses the overdrive channel, and simply lowers the volume on his guitar to get cleaner sounds.

In the studio, Morello uses the same setup for the bulk of the guitar tracks. For ''The Battle of Los Angeles'', he also used a few other amplifiers, such as a Line 6 as heard on the clean, spacey intro of "Mic Check", plus a Pignose mini-amplifier and a MusicMan "Twin" style amplifier.<ref>Tom Morello [http://www.musicfanclubs.org/rage/articles/testify.htm Radical Shriek]. musicfanclubs.org.</ref> During the recording of Audioslave's last album, ''[[Revelations (Audioslave album)|Revelations]]'', Morello experimented with different amplifier setups. For the title track's solo he split his signal to his standard Marshall 2205 head and Peavey cabinet and a 100 watt [[Fender Bassman]] head and an [[Orange Music Electronic Company|Orange cabinet]]. With delay sent to one while the other is unaffected the sound is being "ping-ponged" between the two amplifiers. He also borrowed a [[Vox AC30]] amplifier from producer Brendan O'Brien for some tracks.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.guitarworld.com/article/tom_morello_science_friction?page=0%2C3 |title=Tom Morello: Science Friction |magazine=Guitar World |accessdate=November 15, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090415025323/http://www.guitarworld.com/article/tom_morello_science_friction?page=0%2C3 |archivedate=April 15, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

Morello's unique technique and talent led to him being voted the fifth greatest guitarist of the past 30 years in a 2010 BBC poll.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/8611997.stm |work=BBC News | title=Chilis star is modern guitar hero | date=April 9, 2010 | accessdate=May 25, 2010}}</ref>

==Politics==
===Activism===
Morello, with fellow members of Rage Against the Machine, protested the  "[[Parental Advisory]]" sticker on explicit albums and singles on the part of the [[Parents Music Resource Center]], spearheaded by [[Tipper Gore]]. The protest consisted of the band refusing to perform at [[Lollapalooza]] 1993.  They took the stage naked, mouths covered in duct tape, and bodies painted with the organization's abbreviation, PMRC.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Fletcher|first=Dan|title=Top 10 Music-Festival Moments|url=http://entertainment.time.com/2010/03/18/top-10-music-festival-moments/slide/rage-against-the-machine-at-lollapalooza-1993/|magazine=Time Magazine|accessdate=December 17, 2013|date=March 18, 2010}}</ref> Instead of performing, the band allowed their instruments to feedback for 14 minutes.

In October 2009, Morello, among a number of musicians, sued the U.S. government for the declassification of all documents relating to the use of music in interrogations at the [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp]]. He stated, "Guantanamo is known around the world as one of the places where human beings have been tortured - from waterboarding to stripping, hooding and forcing detainees into humiliating sexual acts - playing music for 72 hours in a row at volumes just below that to shatter the eardrums. Guantanamo may be [[Dick Cheney]]'s idea of America, but it's not mine.

===Axis of Justice===
{{Main|Axis of Justice}}

Morello and Serj Tankian of [[System of a Down]] are the co-founders of Axis of Justice, a political group whose declared purpose is "to bring together musicians, fans of music, and grassroots political organizations to fight for social justice together." They "aim to build a bridge between fans of music around the world and local political organizations to effectively organize around issues of peace, human rights, and economic justice."<ref>[http://www.axisofjustice.net/mission.htm Mission]. Axis of Justice.</ref> The group has worked for such causes as [[immigration|immigrant rights]] and [[Death penalty|death-penalty]] abolition. Its recommended book list includes such authors as [[Karl Marx]], [[Che Guevara]], [[George Orwell]], [[Noam Chomsky]], [[Mumia Abu-Jamal]] and [[Grant Morrison]].<ref>[http://www.axisofjustice.net/books.htm Books]. Axis of Justice.</ref>

Morello and Tankian, together with a handful of other artists, including [[Maynard James Keenan]], [[Wayne Kramer (guitarist)|Wayne Kramer]] of the MC5, the hip hop group [[Jurassic 5]], and [[Michael "Flea" Balzary]] of the [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]], released a live recording of covers and original songs, titled ''The Axis of Justice Concert Series Volume 1''.

On April 6, 2006, Morello was honored with the Eleanor Roosevelt Human Rights Award for his support of worker's rights and for his AOJ work.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://action.americanrightsatwork.org/aaraw/events/er2006/details.tcl |title=2006 Eleanor Roosevelt Human Rights Awards Celebration |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928145358/http://action.americanrightsatwork.org/aaraw/events/er2006/details.tcl |archive-date=September 28, 2007 |work=americanrightsatwork.org}}</ref> Morello has worked on numerous labor campaigns: the Guess sweatshop boycott, the LA janitors strike, the Taco Bell boycott, the southern California grocery workers strike and lockout, and others.

Morello was a strong supporter of the [[2006 United States immigration reform protests]] around the US. Morello played as the Nightwatchman at [[MacArthur Park]] in Los Angeles and has featured many articles on AOJ.<ref name="auto1"/> On September 28, 2006, Morello was one of 400 protesters arrested protesting in support of immigrant hotel workers' rights, in what organizers called "the largest act of civil disobedience in the history of Los Angeles".<ref>Moss, Corey with Chris Harris [http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1542001/20060928/audioslave.jhtml?headlines=true Tom Morello Arrested At Protest, Spends Night In Lockup]. MTV.com, September 2006</ref> Morello knew he was going to be arrested; he wore bright yellow signs, and gave the LAPD his driver's license number a few days before the march. Morello told MTV:

{{quote|"In these political dark ages, it's important for us to stand up for one another. These hotel workers by the airport make 20% less wages than the hotel workers around the rest of Los Angeles. We are here to express our solidarity with them, to help them unionize and help them close the gap between their sub-poverty wages and the millions and millions of dollars the people who own these hotels make."}}

===Shining Path===
Controversially, Morello has on occasion expressed endorsement of the militant Peruvian communist organisation [[Shining Path]]. For example, he carries a sticker of the organisation on one of his guitars and in at least one interview he defends the group by deflecting reports on alleged atrocities.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1999-11-23-9911230083-story.html|title=Rage Against The Machine Fights the Power -- and Storms the Pop Charts|website=CHICAGOTRIBUNE|language=en-US}}</ref> 
 
{{quote|"If there were instances in which the Shining Path committed atrocities, we're absolutely opposed to that. That is something to be condemned. But would (critics of Rage's stance) be as vehement about the U.S. bombing Belgrade, the Sudan and Afghanistan? It's shocking that people can rationalize one sort of violence but not another."}}

==Equipment==

===Guitars===
Morello uses heavily modified guitars from various manufacturers. As of recent, Fender have released a replica of his “Soul Power” Stratocaster.

* Mongrel Custom "Arm The Homeless" - Morello's most famous guitar, and his main guitar for standard tuning since 1986. The original guitar was made for Morello by ''Performance Guitar USA'' to his exact specifications. It featured a Stratocaster body with a Performance Corsair neck, two [[Seymour Duncan]] JB pickups and a chrome original [[Floyd Rose]] tremolo. However, when he got the guitar he hated everything about it and completely reassembled it. Since then just about everything has been changed countless times and the only thing that remains from the original guitar is the body. The body is finished in light blue with the words "Arm The Homeless" written on it in black and red. It has a 3-way pickup selector toggle switch mounted on the lower horn, two volume knobs and one tone knob, four [[Hippopotamus|hippo]]s painted on the front, one large hippo painted upside down on the back, and a [[hammer and sickle]] symbol sticker. The neck is a graphite [[Kramer Guitars|Kramer]] knock-off of unknown make with a 22 fret rosewood fretboard and a "banana" or "hockey stick" headstock. The guitar also has [[Gotoh Hardware|Gotoh]] Crownhead tuners, an [[EMG 85]]/EMG H [[Pick up (music technology)|pickup]] set and an [[Ibanez]] Edge double-locking Tremolo. The guitar is tuned to [[Standard tuning#Plucked strings|standard E]]. This guitar is available in the video game ''[[Guitar Hero 3:Legends of Rock|Guitar Hero 3: Legends of Rock]]''.
* [[Fender Stratocaster]] "Soul Power" - A Fender Aerodyne Stratocaster originally made as a Factory Special Run for Guitar Center. Morello found it on the rack and really liked the look of it. It has a black finished body with white binding and a color-matched headstock. It also has a mirror pickguard, Ibanez Edge double-locking Tremolo, a 2-way on/off toggle switch wired as a kill switch on the lower horn, a Seymour Duncan Hotrails pickup in the bridge and two [[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation|Fender Noiseless]] pickups in the middle and neck positions. It has the words "Soul Power" on the top of the body in silver paint and is his main guitar in Audioslave for songs that are in standard E tuning. In 2020, Fender released replicas of the guitar signed by Morello as part of their 2020 Artist Series collection.
*[[Fender Telecaster]], "[[Sendero Luminoso]]" - A stock black 1982 American-made Standard Telecaster. This is Morello's main guitar for use in [[Drop D tuning|drop-D]] in Rage Against the Machine, Audioslave, Street Sweeper Social Club and Prophets of Rage. He got this guitar in a trade with his roommate, in which Morello traded a [[Marshall Amplification|Marshall]] amplifier head for the Telecaster. The guitar has various pictures taped on its body and most notably has the words "Sendero Luminoso" named after the terrorist group of Peru, classified by the Peruvian government, the [[United States]], the [[European Union]], and [[Canada]] as a terrorist organization,<ref>US Department of State, April 30, 2007. [https://2001-2009.state.gov/s/ct/rls/crt/2006/82738.htm "Terrorist Organizations"].

Also with a small red hammer and sickle communist party sticker.
*Fender Telecaster 2. Black with white binding, mirror pick guard, Fender noiseless pickups and toggle switch on the lower horn. Morello used this guitar when he played with "Fistful of Mercy" on ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]''.
*[[Ibanez]] Artstar Hollowbody (Custom) - Made especially for Morello by Ibanez, this guitar is based on an old [[Vox (musical equipment)|Vox]] Ultrasonic. It contains several on-board effects (wah, echo, dist, treble/bass boost) and is painted in a red and black "split" design that runs over the whole guitar. Used live on the song "Guerrilla Radio" with Rage Against the Machine but rarely seen anywhere else, until it was used in the video clip (and presumably on the studio recording) for [[Cypress Hill]]'s "Rise Up".
*St. George MP-3 "Creamy" - Morello bought this guitar at a Canadian pawnshop for $40 Canadian (about $30 American). It has been modified with a [[DiMarzio]] rail pickup in the bridge position. A toggle switch was also added that is dead in the middle position, resulting in a "hummingbird chirp" when toggled. Used as a [[Drop D tuning]] guitar for some songs on the RATM record ''Evil Empire''. Used in Rage Against the Machine, Audioslave. Notably used for RATM songs "Calm Like a Bomb" and "Tire Me", the latter of which won the band their first [[Grammy Award|Grammy]]. Morello stated in a 2012 video for [[Musician's Friend]] that he recorded "Tire Me" with the St. George and a 20-watt solid state amp; he also said he's "not even sure it's made of wood" in the same video.
*[[Ibanez]] Talman (Custom) - Has three single coil "lipstick" pickups, an Ibanez Lo-Pro Edge tremolo, a killswitch and a custom [[Flag of Kenya|Kenyan flag]] finish. Morello used this guitar on "Revolver", "[[How I Could Just Kill a Man]]", and "Pistol Grip Pump" for RATM and "[[Exploder]]" for Audioslave. The guitar has a faulty internal pickup that makes odd feedback noises, which Morello can adjust by adjusting the tone knob and using the guitar's tremolo. This technique can be heard at the beginning of RATM's "Revolver", Audioslave's "Exploder", and the live version of Street Sweeper Social Club's "Promenade". In addition to this effect, Morello also uses this guitar for Drop D tuning songs that require a killswitch. Morello also owns a second Talman in a white finish, with two mini-humbuckers.
*[[Gibson EDS-1275]] (Double Neck SG) - Cherry finish. Tuned to drop D on both necks. Used live on "[[The Ghost of Tom Joad (song)|The Ghost of Tom Joad]]" with RATM. Since 2017, with Prophets of Rage, Morello uses it again twice for "Rock Superstar" and on most live renditions of "How I Could Just Kill a Man".
*[[Gibson Guitar Corporation|Gibson]] "Budweiser" [[Les Paul (guitar)|Les Paul]] - Given to him in 2006 by [[Brendan O'Brien (record producer)|Brendan O'Brien]] for the recording of Audioslave's third album, ''[[Revelations (Audioslave album)|Revelations]]'', used throughout the whole record. Originally bearing an orange [[Budweiser (Anheuser-Busch)|Budweiser]] logo that Morello hated and burned off with a lighter. He liked the new appearance and modified the guitar with [[DiMarzio]] pickups.
*[[Gibson Les Paul#Standard|Gibson Les Paul Standard]] - Orange burst finish. Tuned to [[Drop B tuning|drop B]] for use in Audioslave and Street Sweeper Social Club. Morello also owns two other Les Pauls, one in a Tobacco burst finish used with Street Sweeper Social Club (it can be seen in the video for "100 Little Curses") and another in a Cherry Red finish (which he calls his "Taco Bell Les Paul"), tuned to drop D and used with Audioslave for [[Soundgarden]] covers.
*[[James Trussart Custom Guitars|James Trussart Steelcaster]] - A [[Fender Telecaster|Telecaster]] style guitar with a body made in steel, finished with a red star graphic over a holey front. Has Seymour Duncan pickups (Alnico pro II in neck and a Hot rails in bridge) and a killswitch on the lower horn. Seen occasionally on the [[Rage Against the Machine reunion tour]] and most recently on the High Hopes tour with Bruce Springsteen. Morello also owns one with polished finish that was used on early tours.
* Ibanez custom guitar "Arm The Homeless duplicate"- Morello's backup guitar for "Arm The Homeless". It has all the same specs as Arm The Homeless (light blue finish, Edge trem, toggle switch on the bottom horn, EMG pickups) but has several small hippos instead of the four larger ones seen on the original guitar. This guitar can be seen briefly in the "[[Sleep Now in the Fire]]" music video, and is often used live with Prophets of Rage on a few standard tuning songs like Know Your Enemy.
*[[Ovation Breadwinner]] - Tuned to standard E, used for "[[Ashes in the Fall]]" for RATM. Also used with a [[Music Man (company)|Music Man]] amplifier and Tone Bender pedal to capture the Korean radio station audio heard at the end of "[[Sleep Now in the Fire]]". Morello owns two other Breadwinners and confines them to the studio because he thinks they look ugly, although he did use one of them in the video for [[Travis Barker]]'s "Carry It", which he is featured in, and in the video for Prophets of Rage's "Living on the 110".
*[[Music Man (company)|Music Man St Vincent]] - Given to him by bandmate [[Tim Commerford]] as a gift in 2018.
*"Whatever It Takes" guitar - A custom Ibanez Galvador classical acoustic guitar he uses during concerts as the Nightwatchman. Plain body with 'Whatever It Takes' and a star (★) written to left of the bridge.
*"Black Spartacus" guitar - A black [[Gibson J-45]] steel string acoustic guitar Morello uses for The Nightwatchman, used prominently on the World Wide Rebel Songs album. Has Morello's own symbol on the left of the bridge which combines the Kenyan, Italian and American flags along with the hammer and sickle symbols and "Black Spartacus" in white on the top of the guitar. Morello says he wrote song "Black Spartacus Heart Attack Machine" as a love song for this new guitar, which appears in the music video for this song.
*Tanglewood Acoustic Guitar.
*[[Gibson Explorer]] II - In a gold finish with gold hardware. This was Morello's main guitar in college, although he claims he ruined its sound by installing a [[Kahler Tremolo System]].
*Kay guitar - Morello's first electric guitar. He bought it for US$50 while his mother bought him an amplifier. It has an [[Gibson SG|SG]] style body and is finished in cherry red. As of 2012, the guitar is still in Morello's possession and he refers to it as "a good, old friend".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kayguitar.com/products/ke2cr.htm|title=Double Cutaway Electric with 2 Humbuckers|first=Jon|last=Norris|website=Kayguitar.com}}</ref>

===Effects and amplifiers===
Morello's amplifier and effects setup has remained practically the same throughout his career in Rage Against the Machine, Audioslave, Street Sweeper Social Club and Prophets of Rage.

Although unconfirmed, it is believed that Morello runs all of his pedals through the effects loop on his Marshall.
*[[Boss Corporation|Boss]] [[Electronic tuner|TU-3 Chromatic Tuner]]
*[[DigiTech]] [[DigiTech Whammy|Whammy WH-1]]
*[[Dunlop Cry Baby]] Classic GCB-95F
*[[Boss Corporation|Boss]] [[Delay (audio effect)|DD-3 Digital Delay]] (most recently seen with two DD-3s: one for a dedicated long delay setting for solos, and the other to go between a short, "slapback" setting and an eighth note "ping-pong" long setting)
*[[DOD Electronics|DOD]] [[Equalization (audio)|FX40b Equalizer]] (Set flat across as a clean volume boost for guitar solos)
*[[MXR]] [[Phaser (effect)|Phase 90]] M-101 (Replaced Morello's Ibanez Flanger around the time Audioslave was formed, now only used for the intro of ''Killing in the Name'')
* Digitech XP-300 "Space Station" (Digitech created this pedal – which imitates a lot of Morello's sounds – after the initial success of Rage Against the Machine. 2019 "Rig Rundown" with ''Premier Guitar'' that he only uses a couple of the Space Station's settings)<ref name="auto">{{cite web|url=https://www.premierguitar.com/articles/28598-rig-rundown-tom-morello|title=Rig Rundown: Tom Morello|first1=Chris Kies|last1=February 13|last2=2019|website=www.premierguitar.com}}</ref>

;Past Effects:
*[[Dunlop Cry Baby]] Original GCB-95 (Morello states that his original Cry Baby is an early 80's model. Retired from the stage, but may still be used in the studio)
*[[Boss Corporation|Boss]] [[Delay (audio effect)|DD-2 Digital Delay]] (used in early Rage Against the Machine)
*[[Ibanez]] [[Flanging|DFL Digital Flanger]] (used in Rage Against the Machine 1991-2000)
*[[Boss Corporation|Boss]] [[Tremolo|TR-2 Tremolo]] (used in Audioslave 2002–2007, also heard on [[Guerrilla Radio]] with Rage Against the Machine)

;Amplification:
*[[Marshall Amplification|Marshall]] JCM800 2205 50-watt head (with the Marshall logo blocked out to avoid endorsement proposals)
*[[Peavey Electronics|Peavey]] VTM 4x12 Cabinet (fitted with four Celestion G12K-85 speakers)
Morello said in his "Rig Rundown" that after his gear was stolen one Valentine's Day years ago, he bought the Marshall head and the Peavey cabinet because he had a session the next weekend and had to "get what [the music store] had." He also removed the Peavey logo from the front of the cabinet because at the time, Hollywood musicians "couldn't be seen with Peavey."<ref name="auto"/>
