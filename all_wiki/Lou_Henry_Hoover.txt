'''Lou Hoover''' ([[née]] '''Henry'''; March 29, 1874 – January 7, 1944) was the wife of [[President of the United States|President]] [[Herbert Hoover]] and served as the [[First Lady of the United States]] from 1929 to 1933.

Marrying her [[geologist]] and [[mining engineering|mining engineer]] husband in 1899, she traveled widely with him, including to [[Shanghai]], China, and became a cultivated scholar and [[linguist]]. She made extensive study of languages including [[Latin]], [[Mandarin Chinese]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[German language|German]], [[Italian language|Italian]] and [[French language|French]]. She oversaw construction of the presidential retreat at [[Rapidan Camp]] in [[Madison County, Virginia]]. She was the first First Lady to make regular nationwide radio broadcasts.

==Early life and education==

Lou Henry was born in [[Waterloo, Iowa]], to Florence Ida ([[Maiden and married names|''née'']] Weed) and Charles Delano Henry who was a banker by trade.<ref name="Allen">Allen</ref><ref name="Hart">Hart, pp. 129–33</ref> Lou grew up something of a tomboy in Waterloo, as well as [[Whittier, California]], and [[Monterey, California]].<ref name="Allen"/> Charles Henry took his daughter on camping trips in the hills—her greatest pleasures in her early teens.<ref name="Allen"/> Lou became a fine horsewoman; she hunted and preserved specimens with the skill of a taxidermist; she developed an enthusiasm for rocks, minerals, and mining.<ref name="Allen"/>

Hoover's postsecondary schooling began at the Los Angeles Normal School, now known as the [[University of California, Los Angeles]]. She later transferred to and graduated from [[San Jose Normal School]], now known as [[San Jose State University]], with a teaching credential in 1893. She then went to [[Stanford University]] where she met Herbert Hoover, who was then a senior. In 1898 she graduated—as the school's only female [[geology]] major at the time—with a B.A. in Geology.<ref name="NFLLbio">{{cite web|title=First Lady Biography: Lou Hoover|url=http://www.firstladies.org/biographies/firstladies.aspx?biography=32|publisher=[[National First Ladies' Library]]|accessdate=20 January 2018}}</ref>

==Marriage and travels==
[[File:Lou Henry Hoover-TIME-1924.jpg|thumb|''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' Cover, 21 Apr 1924]]
When Herbert Hoover graduated from Stanford in June 1895, he and Lou had decided to delay wedding plans while she continued her education and he pursued his engineering career in Australia. In 1898, the year Lou graduated from Stanford, Hoover [[Telegraphy|cabled]] a marriage proposal, which she promptly accepted by return wire.

Both Herbert and Lou were 24 years old when they married on February 10, 1899, at the home of the bride's parents in Monterey, California. Although raised an [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopalian]], Miss Henry decided to become a [[Quaker]].<ref>Gummere, pp. 6, 520–21, 571; Hart, pp. 129–33; Hill, pp. 829–32; Hynes, pp. 2–10.<br>The Quaker heritage of Lou Henry is extensive: beginning with William Woolman (1632–1692); passing to his son, John Woolman (1655–1718), and his wife, Elizabeth Borton (1664–1718); passing to their daughter, Elizabeth Woolman (1685–1755), aunt of Quaker preacher [[John Woolman]] (1720–1772), and her husband, Robert Hunt (died 1716); passing to their son, Robert Hunt (1709–1764), and his wife, Abigail Wood (1715–1747); passing to their son, Robert Hunt (1745–1805), and his wife, Abigail Pancoast (1743–1827); and finally passing to their daughter, Abigail Hunt (1781–1843), and her husband, William Henry (1777–1862), a member of the Methodist Episcopal church.</ref> But because there was no Quaker Meeting in Monterey, they were married in a [[civil ceremony]] performed by Father Ramon Mestres, a [[Roman Catholic priest]] of the [[Cathedral of San Carlos Borromeo]].

===China===
The day after their marriage, the Hoovers sailed from [[San Francisco]] for [[Shanghai]], China, where they spent four days in the [[Astor House Hotel (Shanghai)|Astor House Hotel]].<ref>Allen, p. 23</ref> The newlyweds soon settled into their first home, a large house in [[Tianjin]].  They lived in China from April 1899 until August 1900.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wais.stanford.edu/HooverInstitute/hooverinstit_herberthooverandchina112101.html |title=Herbert Hoover and China |language=en|publisher=World Association for International Studies|quote=The Hoovers arrived in China in April 1899 and lived through the siege of Tienjin. Being an engineer, Mr. Hoover and his detail were responsibie for maintaining the battleworks; Mrs. Hoover worked as a nurse. Although both Hoovers knew how to fire a gun, there is no evidence that they ever shot at the boxers. They left China in August 1900.|date=21 November 2001|accessdate=13 January 2018}}</ref> Hoover's job required extensive travel throughout remote and dangerous areas, which they did together.<ref>Preston</ref> Mrs.&nbsp;Hoover was present with her husband during the [[Boxer Rebellion]].

Mrs.&nbsp;Hoover studied [[Mandarin Chinese]] while living in China. Her [[Chinese name]] was 'Hoo Loo' (古鹿; [[Pinyin]]: Gǔ Lù【胡潞，Hú Lù】) derived from the sound of her name in English. In the White House, at times, she would speak to her husband in it to foil eavesdroppers.<ref name="NFLLbio"/> To date, she is the only First Lady to speak an Asian language.

Mrs.&nbsp;Hoover was also well versed in [[Latin]]; she collaborated with her husband in translating [[Georg Agricola|Agricola's]] ''[[De Re Metallica]]'', a 16th-century encyclopedia of mining and [[metallurgy]]. The Hoover translation was published in 1912, and remains in print today as the standard English translation. During [[World War&nbsp;I]], she assisted her husband in providing relief for [[Belgian]] [[Rape of Belgium|refugees]]. For her work she was decorated in 1919 by King [[Albert&nbsp;I of Belgium]]. She was also involved with the [[American Women’s War Relief Fund|American Women's War Relief Fund]], which provided ambulances, funded two hospitals and provided economic opportunities for women during WWI.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.history.com/topics/first-ladies/lou-hoover|title=Lou Hoover|website=history.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180309201255/https://www.history.com/topics/first-ladies/lou-hoover|archive-date=9 March 2018|access-date=2018-04-26}}</ref><ref name=":2">{{Cite news|url=https://americanwomeninwwi.wordpress.com/2017/01/09/helping-in-britain-the-american-womens-war-relief-fund/|title=Helping in Britain: The American Women's War Relief Fund.|date=2017-01-09|work=American Women in World War I|access-date=2018-04-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170927022703/https://americanwomeninwwi.wordpress.com/2017/01/09/helping-in-britain-the-american-womens-war-relief-fund/|archive-date=27 September 2017|language=en-US}}</ref>

==As First Lady (1929–1933)==
===Radio broadcasts===
[[File:Lou-Henry-Hoover-WH-Portrait.jpg|thumb|A portrait of Lou Henry Hoover by Richard Marsden Brown hangs in the [[Vermeil Room]] of the [[White House]].]]
Mrs.&nbsp;Hoover distinguished herself by becoming the first First Lady to broadcast on a regular and nationwide basis. Although she did not have her own radio program, she participated as a guest speaker on a number of occasions between 1929 and 1933, often advocating for volunteerism, or discussing the work of the Girl Scouts. Radio critics praised her for having an excellent radio voice and for speaking with confidence.<ref>For example, see Larry Wolters, "First Lady to Give First Talk At White House" in the ''Chicago Tribune'', March 22, 1931, G9.</ref>

===Presidential traditions===
As First Lady, she discontinued the New Year's Day reception, the annual open house observance begun by [[Abigail Adams]] in 1801.

She played a critical role in designing and overseeing the construction of a rustic presidential retreat at [[Rapidan Camp]] in [[Madison County, Virginia|Madison County]], [[Virginia]]. It was a precursor of the current presidential retreat, [[Camp David]].

==Family life==
The Hoovers had two sons:
* '''[[Herbert Hoover, Jr.|Herbert Charles Hoover]]''' (1903–1969)  – engineer, diplomat. Born in [[London]], by age two, he had been around the world twice with his globetrotting parents. He graduated from [[Stanford University]] in 1925 and began working as an aircraft engineer. He taught briefly, from 1928 to 1929, at [[Harvard Business School]]. Eventually, he turned to [[Geophysics|geophysical]] engineering, founding the United Geophysical Company in 1935 to develop new electronic instruments to [[Hydrocarbon exploration|discover oil]]. He served as mediator during the 1953–1954 [[Mohammad Mosaddegh#Support for oil nationalization|oil dispute]] between Britain and [[Iran]]. He was appointed [[Under Secretary of State]] for Middle Eastern affairs 1954–1957 by President Eisenhower. He died in [[Pasadena, California]].
* '''[[Allan Hoover|Allan Henry Hoover]]''' (1907–1993) – mining engineer and financier. Born in London, he graduated in economics from [[Stanford University]] in 1929 and earned a master's degree from the [[Harvard Business School]] in 1931. He went into banking and operated a ranch in California for a time, but eventually he, too, became a mining engineer. A private man, he shunned publicity throughout his career. He died in [[Portola Valley, California]].

==Later life and death==

Lou Henry Hoover died of a [[heart attack]] in New York City on January 7, 1944. She was found dead in her bedroom by her husband, who came to kiss her good night. She was originally buried in [[Palo Alto, California]]. Her husband was devastated by her death and never considered remarrying.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9uD4DAAAQBAJ&q=lou|title=Herbert Hoover: A Life|last1=Jeansonne|first1=Glen|last2=Luhrssen|first2=David|date=2016|publisher=Penguin|isbn=9781101991008|language=en}}</ref> Following Herbert Hoover’s death in 1964, she was reinterred next to the former president at [[West Branch, Iowa]].

==Activities==
