The '''Met Gala''', formally called the '''Costume Institute Gala''' or the '''Costume Institute Benefit''' and also known as the '''Met Ball''', is an annual fundraising [[festival|gala]] for the benefit of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]'s [[Costume Institute]] in [[New York City]]. It marks the opening of the Costume Institute's annual fashion exhibit.<ref name="metmuseum.org">{{Cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/about-the-met/curatorial-departments/the-costume-institute|title=The Costume Institute {{!}} The Metropolitan Museum of Art|website=www.metmuseum.org|access-date=May 17, 2016}}</ref> Each year's event celebrates the theme of that year's Costume Institute exhibition, and the exhibition sets the tone for the formal dress of the night, since guests are expected to choose their fashion to match the theme of the exhibit.

The Met Gala was established in 1948 as a way to raise money for the newly-founded Costume Institute and mark the opening of its annual exhibit. The first Gala was a midnight dinner and tickets were fifty dollars each.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.metmuseum.org/blogs/now-at-the-met/2018/met-gala-costume-institute-benefit-brief-history|title=The Met Gala: From Midnight Suppers to Superheroes and Rihanna|first=Nancy|last=Chilton|website=www.metmuseum.org|date=April 30, 2018|access-date=January 3, 2019}}</ref> Based upon the legacy left by former ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'' editor-in-chief [[Diana Vreeland]] as "special consultant" to the Costume Institute, since 1973 the Met Gala has become well known as a luxurious, [[blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]] event and is considered "the jewel in New York City's social crown".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.townandcountrymag.com/the-scene/parties/a9551568/met-gala-history/|title=The Met Ball Was So Much Better Before All the Celebrities Showed Up|date=May 3, 2018|work=Town & Country|access-date=December 2, 2018|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.architecturaldigest.com/gallery/the-met-galas-history-and-decor-throughout-the-years/all|title=A Look Back At The Met Gala's History And Decor Throughout The Years {{!}} Architectural Digest|work=Architectural Digest|access-date=December 2, 2018|language=en}}</ref>

== History ==
The Met Gala was established in 1948 by fashion publicist [[Eleanor Lambert]] as a way to raise money for the newly-founded Costume Institute and mark the opening of its annual exhibit. The first gala was a dinner and tickets were fifty dollars each.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.metmuseum.org/blogs/now-at-the-met/2018/met-gala-costume-institute-benefit-brief-history|title=The Met Gala: From Midnight Suppers to Superheroes and Rihanna|first=Nancy|last=Chilton|website=www.metmuseum.org|date=April 30, 2018|access-date=January 3, 2019}}</ref> For the first few decades of its existence the gala was simply one of many annual benefits held for New York [[charitable organization|charitable institutions]]. Accordingly, the attendees of the early galas were almost entirely members of New York [[high society (social class)|high society]] or the city's [[New York  Fashion Week|fashion industry]]. From 1948 to 1971, the event was held at venues including the [[Waldorf Astoria New York|Waldorf-Astoria]], [[Central Park]], and the [[Rainbow Room]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.architecturaldigest.com/gallery/the-met-galas-history-and-decor-throughout-the-years/all|title=A Look Back At The Met Gala's History And Decor Throughout The Years {{!}} Architectural Digest|work=Architectural Digest|access-date=December 1, 2018|language=en}}</ref>

When Diana Vreeland became consultant to the Costume Institute in 1972, the Gala began to evolve into a more glamorous affair, although one that was still aimed at the societal set.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.townandcountrymag.com/the-scene/parties/a9551568/met-gala-history/|title=The Met Ball Was So Much Better Before All the Celebrities Showed Up|date=May 3, 2018|work=Town & Country|access-date=December 1, 2018|language=en-US}}</ref> The event started to become more celebrity-oriented with attendees like [[Elizabeth Taylor]], [[Andy Warhol]], [[Bianca Jagger]], [[Diana Ross]], [[Elton John]], [[Liza Minnelli]] and [[Cher]] intermixing with the city's elite.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.architecturaldigest.com/gallery/the-met-galas-history-and-decor-throughout-the-years/all|title=A Look Back At The Met Gala's History And Decor Throughout The Years {{!}} Architectural Digest|work=Architectural Digest|access-date=December 1, 2018|language=en}}</ref> It was during the Vreeland years that the Gala was first held at the Met and that Gala themes were introduced.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.architecturaldigest.com/gallery/the-met-galas-history-and-decor-throughout-the-years/all|title=A Look Back At The Met Gala's History And Decor Throughout The Years {{!}} Architectural Digest|work=Architectural Digest|access-date=December 1, 2018|language=en}}</ref>

== Controversy ==
Models [[Naomi Campbell]] and [[Stephanie Seymour]] pulled out of attending the 2009 Gala at the last minute, in a show of support for designer [[Azzedine Alaïa]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://runway.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/05/04/alaia-pulls-his-dresses-from-the-met-gala/|title=Alaïa Pulls His Dresses From the Met Gala|last=Horyn|first=Cathy|date=2009-05-04|website=On the Runway Blog|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-20}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://runway.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/05/04/met-gala-stephanie-seymour-will-stay-home-too/|title=Met Gala: Stephanie Seymour Will Stay Home, Too|last=Horyn|first=Cathy|date=2009-05-04|website=On the Runway Blog|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-20}}</ref> After he found out that none of his work was included in the Costume Institute exhibit, Alaïa asked the models not to wear the dresses he had designed for them to the gala and they chose not to attend altogether. Alaïa was well-known for his close relationships with models so his exclusion from the "Model as Muse" exhibit was seen as a snub.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thecut.com/2009/05/naomi_campbell_didnt_show_at_a.html|title=Naomi Campbell Didn't Attend Anna Wintour's Big Ball Because Azzedine Alaïa Got Snubbed|website=The Cut|language=en-us|access-date=2020-04-20}}</ref> He criticized Wintour (with whom he had a longtime feud)<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.harpersbazaar.co.uk/fashion/fashion-news/why-we-love-azzedine-alaia-paris-fashion-week|title=Why we love Azzedine Alaia|last=Cope|first=Rebecca|date=2013-09-26|website=Harper's BAZAAR|language=en-GB|access-date=2020-04-20}}</ref> for having "too much power over this museum."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://runway.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/05/04/alaia-pulls-his-dresses-from-the-met-gala/|title=Alaïa Pulls His Dresses From the Met Gala|last=Horyn|first=Cathy|date=2009-05-04|website=On the Runway Blog|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-20}}</ref>

In 2014, when the Met Gala announced a [[dress code]] requiring [[white tie]], a number of media outlets pointed out the difficulty and expense of obtaining traditional white tie, even for the [[celebrity]] guests.<ref>{{Cite news|author-last=Trebay|author-first=Guy|title=At the Met Gala, a Strict Dress Code|work=New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/24/fashion/at-the-met-gala-a-strict-dress-code.html?_r=2|date=April 23, 2014|accessdate=September 29, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|title=The Met Ball Is White Tie This Year—But What Does That Even Mean?|author-last=Rothman|author-first=Lily|url=http://time.com/83217/white-tie-costume-institute-gala/|work=Time|date=May 5, 2014|accessdate=September 29, 2015}}</ref>

In 2015, the theme "China: Through the Looking Glass" was previously named "Chinese Whispers: Tales of the East in Art, Film and Fashion".<ref name="au.complex.com">{{Cite web|url=http://au.complex.com/style/2015/05/met-gala-2015-asian-appropriation-china-through-the-looking-glass|title=The China-Themed Met Gala Wasn't Totally Offensive, But Still Problematic|website=Complex AU|access-date=May 17, 2016}}</ref> The same year's theme was met with critics saying it was "A reminder of the subtle institutionalised racism that's been compounded by centuries of Asian isolationism across the board, and enduring Western stereotypes exacerbated by ignorance and the meme-able nature of social media."<ref name="au.complex.com"/>

In 2016, [[Madonna]], whilst channeling the theme "Manus x Machina: Fashion in an Age of Technology", provided one of the most controversial outfits in the gala's history. She appeared in an ensemble designed by [[Givenchy]] creative director [[Riccardo Tisci]] exposing both her breasts and buttocks.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/celebrity-style/red-carpet/madonnas-peekaboob-met-gala-moment/news-story/8210214260ffc6e6080d3c4b91398ad0|title=Madonna's peek-a-boob Met Gala moment|website=NewsComAu|access-date=May 17, 2016}}</ref> Madonna hit back on her official social media channels by stating "We have fought and continue to fight for civil rights and gay rights around the world. When it comes to women’s rights we are still in the dark ages. My dress at the Met Ball was a political statement as well as a fashion statement".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/celebrity-style/red-carpet/madonna-slams-ageist-and-sexist-met-gala-outfit-critics/news-story/62dae2042c15284ae704a2439b9ae158|title=Madonna slams 'ageist and sexist' Met Gala outfit critics|website=NewsComAu|access-date=May 17, 2016}}</ref>

The 2018 Gala had a [[Roman Catholic]] theme, and included [[Rihanna]] wearing a papal [[mitre]]. Critics on social media called it "blasphemous" and "sacrilegious cosplay", even though the Catholic Church lent more than forty [[papal vestment]]s from the [[Holy See|Vatican]], and Cardinal [[Timothy M. Dolan]] attended.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Quinn|first1=Dave|title=The Met Gala's 'Catholic Imagination' Theme Called 'Blasphemous' and 'Sacrilegious' by Critics|url=http://people.com/style/met-gala-2018-critics-call-catholic-theme-blasphemous/|accessdate=May 9, 2018|work=[[People (magazine)|People]]|date=May 8, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Syme|first1=Rachel|title=Pope Rihanna and Other Revelations from the Catholic-Themed 2018 Met Gala|url=https://www.newyorker.com/culture/on-and-off-the-avenue/pope-rihanna-and-other-revelations-from-the-catholic-themed-2018-met-gala|accessdate=May 9, 2018|work=[[The New Yorker]]|date=May 8, 2018}}</ref> [[Kyle Smith (critic)|Kyle Smith]] argued that the Catholic Church was in fact "abetting the mockery of its symbols".<ref>{{cite news|last1=Smith|first1=Kyle|author-link=Kyle Smith (critic)|title=Red-Carpet Catholicism Is a Loss for the Church|url=https://www.nationalreview.com/2018/05/met-gala-red-carpet-mocks-catholic-symbols|accessdate=May 9, 2018|work=[[National Review]]|date=May 9, 2018}}</ref>

As of 2018, Wintour announced that guests may not be allowed to attend the gala before the age of 18.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/met-gala-has-new-18-age-restriction-maddie-ziegler-reveals-1108774|title=Met Gala Has New Age Restriction for Attendees|work=The Hollywood Reporter|access-date=November 30, 2018|language=en}}</ref>
