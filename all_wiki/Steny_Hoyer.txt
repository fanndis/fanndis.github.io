===Elections===
Fifth district Congresswoman [[Gladys Spellman]] fell into a [[coma]] three days before the 1980 election. She was reelected, but it soon became apparent that she would never regain consciousness, and Congress declared her seat vacant by resolution in February 1981. Hoyer narrowly won a crowded seven-way Democratic [[primary election|primary]], beating Spellman's husband Reuben by only 1,600 votes. He then defeated a better-funded [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], Audrey Scott, in the May 19 [[special election]] by 56%–44%, earning himself the nickname of "boy wonder".<ref name="washingtonpost.com">Shailagh Murray [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/11/16/AR2006111601524.html "Political Pragmatism Carried Hoyer to the Top"].

Hoyer is a prolific fundraiser for House Democrats. He has been the top giver to fellow party members in the House. In the 2008 election cycle, he contributed more than $1 million to the party and individual candidates as of July 14, 2008.<ref>{{cite news |title=Hoyer Is a Giver |work=[[Congressional Quarterly]] |date=July 14, 2008 |url=http://www.cq.com/document/display.do?dockey=/cqonline/prod/data/docs/html/news/110/news110-000002916307.html@allnews&pub=news&print=true}}</ref>

===Party leadership===
Hoyer has served as chairman of the [[Democratic Caucus of the United States House of Representatives|Democratic Caucus]], the fourth-ranking position among House Democrats, from 1989 to 1994; the former co-chair (and a current member) of the Democratic Steering Committee; and as the chief candidate recruiter for House Democrats from 1995 to 2000. He also served as Deputy Majority [[Whip (politics)|Whip]] from 1987 to 1989.<ref name="MD Archives" />

When [[David E. Bonior]] resigned as Minority Whip in early 2002, Hoyer ran but lost to [[Nancy Pelosi]]. After the 2002 midterm elections, Pelosi ran to succeed [[Dick Gephardt]] as Minority Leader, leaving the Minority Whip post open again.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://politics.blogs.foxnews.com/2010/11/05/hoyer-has-won-contested-leadership-races |work=Fox News |title=Hoyer has won contested leadership races before - FoxNews.com |date=November 5, 2010}}</ref> On November 14, 2002, Hoyer was unanimously elected by his colleagues in the Democratic Caucus to serve as the Minority Whip, the second-highest-ranking position among House Democrats.<ref name="Hoyer official bio" />

Pelosi became the [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] in January 2007. Hoyer was elected by his colleagues to be House Majority Leader for the 110th Congress, defeating [[John Murtha]] of [[Pennsylvania]] by a vote of 149–86 within the [[House Democratic Caucus|caucus]], despite Pelosi endorsing Murtha.<ref name="reuters20061116"/><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/POLITICS/11/08/congress.new.leader/|title=CNN: Scramble is on to replace Congressional leaders|date=November 9, 2006|work=CNN|accessdate=2006-11-09}}</ref> Hoyer is the first Marylander to become Majority Leader.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://democraticleader.house.gov/about_the_whip/about_steny_hoyer/bio.cfm |title=About the Majority Leader |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070115074025/http://democraticleader.house.gov/about_the_whip/about_steny_hoyer/bio.cfm |archive-date=2007-01-15 |website=Office of the House Democratic Majority Leader}}</ref> and became the highest-ranking federal lawmaker in Maryland history.<ref name="Hoyer official bio" /> In this post, Hoyer was the floor leader of the House Democrats and ranked second in the leadership after the Speaker who is the actual head of the majority party in the house.

The day after the 2010 midterm elections in which the Democrats lost control of the House, Hoyer had a private conversation with Pelosi and stated that he would not challenge her bid for Minority Leader (for Pelosi to remain Democratic House Leader).<ref>{{cite news|last1=Murphy|first1=Patricia|url=http://www.politicsdaily.com/2010/11/03/nancy-pelosi-has-no-regrets-following-midterm-rout/|title=Nancy Pelosi Has 'No Regrets' Following Midterm Rout|department=The Capitolist|work=[[Politics Daily]]|date=3 November 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101104233827/http://www.politicsdaily.com/2010/11/03/nancy-pelosi-has-no-regrets-following-midterm-rout/|archivedate=4 November 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref> He ran for minority whip, but was challenged by outgoing Majority Whip [[Jim Clyburn]] (the top House Democrats wanted to remain in the leadership, but the minority party in the House has one less position). Hoyer is moderate while Pelosi and Clyburn are more liberal, and a significant number of Hoyer's would-be supporters in the House who were moderate and conservative Democrats had been defeated for reelection.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/onpolitics/post/2010/11/steny-hoyer-james-clyburn-democratic-leadership-/1 |work=USA Today |first=Catalina |last=Camia |title=Democrats Hoyer, Clyburn fight for leadership post |date=November 8, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/postpartisan/2010/11/hire_hoyer.html |work=The Washington Post |title=Hire Hoyer}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2010/11/08/hoyer-clyburn-an-impromptu-leadership-fight/ |work=The Wall Street Journal |first=Patrick |last=O'Connor |title=Hoyer, Clyburn: An Impromptu Leadership Fight |date=November 8, 2010}}</ref> The [[Congressional Black Caucus]] backed Clyburn, while 30 House Democrats have supported Hoyer, and Hoyer has also raised money and campaigned for many candidates.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com/2010/11/high-profile-dems-back-hoyer-in-whip-race.php|title=High Profile Dems Back Hoyer In Whip Race|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/darcy-burner/the-progressive-case-for_b_779979.html |work=Huffington Post |first=Darcy |last=Burner |title=The Progressive Case for Steny Hoyer as Minority Whip |date=May 25, 2011}}</ref> Hoyer received further support from outgoing Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman [[Howard L.

Hoyer and the DCCC have been criticized for picking their preferred candidates through an undemocratic process. In 2018, it was reported that Hoyer sought to alter the outcome of the primary race in [[Colorado's 6th congressional district]]. Hoyer was recorded urging progressive candidate [[Levi Tillemann]] to drop out of the race. Hoyer acknowledged that the DCCC had already identified its choice candidate and discouraged a candid discussion about his weaknesses.<ref name=intercept>{{cite news |last=Fang |first=Lee |date=April 26, 2018 |title=SECRETLY TAPED AUDIO REVEALS DEMOCRATIC LEADERSHIP PRESSURING PROGRESSIVE TO LEAVE RACE |url=https://theintercept.com/2018/04/26/steny-hoyer-audio-levi-tillemann/?link_id=1&can_id=1ba27d10330c5ba97dcdb8dc6623001a&source=email-secret-audio-of-steny-hoyer&email_referrer=email_343049&email_subject=secret-audio-of-steny-hoyer |work=The Intercept |access-date=April 26, 2018 }}</ref> On November 28, 2018, Hoyer was selected to return as House Majority Leader.<ref name=nov28 /><ref name=bsnov28 />
