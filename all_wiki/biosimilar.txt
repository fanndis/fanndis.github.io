{{short description|A variant of a biopharmaceutical that is marketed following the expiry of the original patent.}}
A '''biosimilar''' is a [[biopharmaceutical|biologic medical product]] (also known as biologic) highly similar to another already approved biological medicine (the 'reference medicine'). Biosimilars are approved according to the same standards of pharmaceutical quality, safety and efficacy that apply to all biological medicines.<ref name="EU overview">{{cite web | title=Biosimilar medicines: Overview | website=[[European Medicines Agency]] (EMA) | url=https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/human-regulatory/overview/biosimilar-medicines-overview | access-date=21 April 2020}}</ref> Biosimilars are officially approved versions of original "innovator" products and can be manufactured when the original product's [[chemical patent|patent]] expires.<ref name="biosimilars2012" /> Reference to the innovator product is an integral component of the approval.

Unlike with [[generic drug]]s of the more common [[small molecule|small-molecule]] type, biologics generally exhibit high molecular complexity and may be quite sensitive to changes in manufacturing processes. Despite that heterogeneity, all [[biopharmaceutical]]s, including biosimilars, must maintain consistent quality and clinical performance throughout their lifecycle.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Lamanna WC, Holzmann J, Cohen HP, Guo X, Schweigler M, Stangler T, Seidl A, Schiestl M | title = Maintaining consistent quality and clinical performance of biopharmaceuticals | journal = Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy | volume = 18 | issue = 4 | pages = 369–379 | date = April 2018 | pmid = 29285958 | doi = 10.1080/14712598.2018.1421169 | doi-access = free }}</ref> A biosimilar is not regarded as a generic of a biological medicine. This is mostly because the natural variability and more complex manufacturing of biological medicines do not allow an exact replication of the molecular micro-heterogeneity.<ref name="EU overview" />
Drug-related authorities such as the EU's [[European Medicines Agency]] (EMA), the US's [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA), and the [[Health Products and Food Branch]] of [[Health Canada]] hold their own guidance on requirements for demonstration of the similar nature of two biological products in terms of safety and efficacy. According to them, analytical studies demonstrate that the biological product is highly similar to the reference product, despite minor differences in clinically inactive components, animal studies (including the assessment of toxicity), and a clinical study or studies (including the assessment of [[immunogenicity]] and [[pharmacokinetics]] or [[pharmacodynamics]]). They are sufficient to demonstrate safety, purity, and potency in one or more appropriate conditions of use for which the reference product is licensed and is intended to be used and for which licensure is sought for the biological product.

The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) published its "Guidelines for the evaluation of similar biotherapeutic products (SBPs)" in 2009. The purpose of this guideline is to provide an international norm for evaluating biosimilars with a high degree of similarity with an already licensed, reference biotherapeutic medicine.<ref>{{cite report|url=https://www.who.int/biologicals/areas/biological_therapeutics/BIOTHERAPEUTICS_FOR_WEB_22APRIL2010.pdf|title=Guidelines on evaluation of similar Biotherapeutic Products (SBPs)|year=2009|publisher=[[World Health Organization]] (WHO)}}</ref><ref>{{cite report | title=Guidelines on evaluation of similar Biotherapeutic Products (SBPs), Annex 2, Technical Report Series No. 977 | publisher=[[World Health Organization]] (WHO) | year=2013 | url=https://www.who.int/biologicals/publications/trs/areas/biological_therapeutics/TRS_977_Annex_2.pdf?ua=1 }}</ref><ref>{{cite report | title=WHO Questions and Answers: Similar Biotherapeutic Products | publisher=[[World Health Organization]] (WHO) | year=2018 | url=https://www.who.int/biologicals/expert_committee/QA_for_SBPs_ECBS_2018.pdf?ua=1 }}</ref><ref>{{cite report | title=Guidelines on evaluation of monoclonal antibodies as similar biotherapeutic products (SBPs), Annex 2, Technical Report Series No. 1004 | publisher=[[World Health Organization]] (WHO) | year=2017 | url=https://www.who.int/biologicals/biotherapeutics/WHO_TRS_1004_web_Annex_2.pdf?ua=1 }}</ref>

The European Union was the first region in the world to develop a legal, regulatory, and scientific framework for approving biosimilar medicines. The EMA has granted a marketing authorization for more than 50 biosimilars since 2006 (first approved biosimilar Somatropin(Growth hormone)). The first biosimilar of a [[monoclonal antibody]] to be approved worldwide was a biosimilar of [[infliximab]] in the EU in 2013.<ref name="EU overview" /> On March 6, 2015, the FDA approved the United States's first biosimilar product, the biosimilar of [[filgrastim]] called filgrastim-sndz (trade name Zarxio) by [[Sandoz]].

==Approval processes ==
Approval of medicines in the EU relies on a solid legal framework, which in 2004, introduced a dedicated route for the approval of biosimilars. The EU has pioneered the regulation of biosimilars since the approval of the first one (the growth hormone somatropin) in 2006.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}} Since then, the EU has approved the highest number of biosimilars worldwide,{{citation needed|date=December 2019}} and consequently has the most extensive experience of their use and safety.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}} All medicines produced using biotechnology and those for specific indications (e.g. for cancer, neurodegeneration and auto-immune diseases) must be approved in the EU through the EMA (via the so-called 'centralised procedure'). Nearly all biosimilars approved for use in the EU have been approved centrally, as they use biotechnology for their production. Some biosimilars may be approved at national level, such as some low-molecular weight heparins derived from porcine intestinal mucosa. When a company applies for marketing authorization at EMA, data are evaluated by EMA's scientific committees on human medicines and on safety (the CHMP and PRAC), as well as by EU experts on biological medicines (Biologics Working Party) and specialists in biosimilars (Biosimilar Working Party). The review by EMA results in a scientific opinion, which is then sent to the European Commission, which ultimately grants an EU-wide marketing authorization.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/leaflet/biosimilars-eu-information-guide-healthcare-professionals_en.pdf}}</ref>

In the United States, the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) held that new legislation was required to enable them to approve biosimilars to those biologics originally approved through the PHS Act pathway.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://judiciary.senate.gov/testimony.cfm?id=1239&wit_id=3623|title=US Senate Committee on the Judiciary, Testimony of Dr. Lester Crawford, Acting Commissioner, FDA June 23, 2004|access-date=October 8, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161228003407/http://www.judiciary.senate.gov/testimony.cfm?id=1239&wit_id=3623|archive-date=December 28, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>  Additional Congressional hearings have been held.<ref>[http://energycommerce.house.gov/cmte_mtgs/110-he-hrg.050207.Biosimilar.shtml Hearing: Assessing the Impact of a Safe and Equitable Biosimilar Policy in the United States.

The FDA gained the authority to approve biosimilars (including interchangeables that are substitutable with their reference product) as part of the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] signed into law by President Obama on March 23, 2010.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}

The FDA has previously approved biologic products using comparability, for example, [[Omnitrope]] in May 2006, but this like [[Enoxaparin]] was also to a reference product, [[Genotropin]], originally approved as a [[biologic drug]] under the FD&C Act.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fda.gov/ohrms/dockets/dockets/04P0231/04P-0231-pdn0001.pdf|title=FDA Response to three Citizen Petitions against biosimilars}}</ref>

On March 6, 2015, [[Zarxio]] obtained the first approval of FDA.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm436648.htm|title=FDA page on "FDA approves first biosimilar product Zarxio"}}</ref> Sandoz's Zarxio is biosimilar to Amgen's Neupogen (filgrastim), which was originally licensed in 1991. This is the first product to be passed under the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (BPCI Act), which was passed as part of the Affordable Healthcare Act. But Zarxio was approved as a biosimilar, not as an interchangeable product, the FDA notes. And under the BPCI Act, only a biologic that has been approved as an "interchangeable" may be substituted for the reference product without the intervention of the health care provider who prescribed the reference product. The FDA said its approval of Zarxio is based on review of evidence that included structural and functional characterization, animal study data, human pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics data, clinical immunogenicity data and other clinical safety and effectiveness data that demonstrates [[Zarxio]] is biosimilar to Neupogen.

In March 2020, most protein products that were approved as drug products (including every insulin currently on the market {{as of|December 2019|lc=yes}}) are scheduled to open up to biosimilar and interchangeable competition in the United States.<ref name="FDA Statement">{{cite web | title=Statement on low-cost biosimilar and interchangeable protein products | website=U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) | date=17 December 2019 | url=https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/statement-low-cost-biosimilar-and-interchangeable-protein-products | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191218020741/https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/statement-low-cost-biosimilar-and-interchangeable-protein-products | archive-date=18 December 2019 | url-status=live | access-date=17 December 2019}} {{PD-notice}}</ref> However, "chemically synthesized polypeptides" are excluded from this transition, which means that a product that falls within this category won't be able to come to market as a biosimilar or interchangeable product, but will have to come to the market under a different pathway.<ref name="FDA Statement" />

==Background==
Cloning of human genetic material and development of in vitro biological production systems has allowed the production of virtually any [[recombinant DNA]] based biological substance for eventual development of a drug. [[Monoclonal antibody]] technology combined with recombinant DNA technology has paved the way for tailor-made and targeted medicines. [[gene therapy|Gene-]] and [[cell therapy|cell-based]] therapies are emerging as new approaches.

Recombinant therapeutic [[proteins]] are of a complex nature (composed of a long chain of amino acids, modified amino acids, derivatized by sugar moieties, folded by complex mechanisms). These proteins are made in living cells (bacteria, yeast, animal or human cell lines). The ultimate characteristics of a drug containing a recombinant therapeutic protein are to a large part determined by the process through which they are produced: choice of the cell type, development of the genetically modified cell for production, production process,  purification process, formulation of the therapeutic protein into a drug.

After the expiry of the patent of approved recombinant drugs (e.g., [[insulin]],  human [[growth hormone]], [[interferons]], [[erythropoietin]], monoclonal antibodies and more) any other biotech company can develop and market these [[biologic medical product|biologics]] (thus called biosimilars).
Every biological (or biopharmaceutical products) displays a certain degree of variability, even between different batches of the same product, which is due to the inherent variability of the biological expression system and the manufacturing process.<ref name="pmid25298038">{{cite journal | vauthors = Weise M, Kurki P, Wolff-Holz E, Bielsky MC, Schneider CK | title = Biosimilars: the science of extrapolation | journal = Blood | volume = 124 | issue = 22 | pages = 3191–6 | date = November 2014 | pmid = 25298038 | doi = 10.1182/blood-2014-06-583617 | url = http://www.bloodjournal.org/content/early/2014/10/08/blood-2014-06-583617 | doi-access = free }}</ref> Any kind of reference product has undergone numerous changes in its manufacturing processes, and such changes in the manufacturing process (ranging from a change in the supplier of cell culture media to new purification methods or new manufacturing sites) was substantiated with appropriate data and was approved by the EMA. In contrast, it is mandatory for biosimilars to take a both non-clinical and clinical test that the most sensitive clinical models are asked to show to enable detection of differences between the two products in terms of human [[pharmacokinetics]] (PK) and [[pharmacodynamics]] (PD), efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity.

The current concept of development of biosimilar mAbs follows the principle that an extensive state of the art physicochemical, analytical and functional comparison of the molecules is complemented by comparative non-clinical and clinical data that establish equivalent efficacy and safety in a clinical "model" indication that is most sensitive to detect any minor differences (if these exist) between biosimilar and its reference mAb also at the clinical level.

The [[European Medicines Agency]] (EMA) has recognized this fact, which has resulted in the establishment of the term "biosimilar" in recognition that, whilst biosimilar products are similar to the original product, they are not exactly the same.<ref>[http://www.emea.europa.eu/pdfs/human/biosimilar/043704en.pdf  EMEA  guideline on similar biological medicinal products] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070630132050/http://www.emea.europa.eu/pdfs/human/biosimilar/043704en.pdf |date=June 30, 2007 }}</ref>
Every biological displays a certain degree of variability. However, provided that structure and function(s), pharmacokinetic profiles and pharmacodynamic effect(s) and/or efficacy can be shown to be comparable for the biosimilar and the reference product, those adverse drug reactions which are related to exaggerated pharmacological effects can also be expected at similar frequencies.

Originally the complexity of biological molecules led to requests for substantial efficacy and safety data for a biosimilar approval. This has been progressively replaced with a greater dependence on assays, from quality through to clinical, that show assay sensitivity sufficient to detect any significant difference in dose.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Warren JB | title = Generics, chemisimilars and biosimilars: is clinical testing fit for purpose? | journal = British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology | volume = 75 | issue = 1 | pages = 7–14 | date = January 2013 | pmid = 22574725 | pmc = 3555041 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2125.2012.04323.x }}</ref> However, the safe application of biologics depends on an informed and appropriate use by healthcare professionals and patients. Introduction of biosimilars also requires a specifically designed [[pharmacovigilance]] plan. It is difficult and costly to recreate biologics because the complex proteins are derived from living organisms that are genetically modified. In contrast, small molecule drugs made up of a chemically based compound can be easily replicated and are considerably less expensive to reproduce. In order to be released to the public, biosimilars must be shown to be as close to identical to the parent innovator biologic product based on data compiled through clinical, animal, analytical studies and conformational status.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = http://www.bioprocessintl.com/manufacturing/biosimilars/higher-order-structure-comparability/|title = Higher-Order Structure Comparability: Case Studies of Biosimilar Monoclonal Antibodies|last = Wang|first = X.|date = June 1, 2014|journal = BioProcess International|issue = 6|volume = 12|pages=32–37}}</ref><ref name="pmid23286777">{{cite journal | vauthors = Declerck PJ | title = Biosimilar monoclonal antibodies: a science-based regulatory challenge | journal = Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy | volume = 13 | issue = 2 | pages = 153–6 | date = February 2013 | pmid = 23286777 | doi = 10.1517/14712598.2012.758710 | doi-access = free }}</ref>

Generally, once a drug is released in the market by the FDA, it has to be re-evaluated for its safety and efficacy once every six months for the first and second years. Afterward, re-evaluations are conducted yearly, and the result of the assessment should be reported to authorities such as FDA. Biosimilars are required to undergo pharmacovigilance (PVG) regulations as its reference product. Thus biosimilars approved by the EMA (European Medicines Agency) are required to submit a risk management plan (RMP) along with the marketing application and have to provide regular safety update reports after the product is in the market. The RMP includes the safety profile of the drug and proposes the prospective pharmacovigilance studies.

Several PK studies, such as studies conducted by Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP), have been conducted under various ranges of conditions; Antibodies from an originator's product versus antibodies from an biosimilar; combination therapy and monotherapy; various diseases, etc. on the purpose to verify comparability in pharmacokinetics of the biosimilar with the reference medicinal product in a sufficiently sensitive and homogeneous population. Importantly, provided that structure and function(s), pharmacokinetic profiles and pharmacodynamic effect(s) and/or efficacy can be shown to be comparable for the biosimilar and the reference product, those adverse drug reactions which are related to exaggerated pharmacological effects can also be expected at similar frequencies.

==European Union approvals of biosimilars==
The European Union has the largest number of approved biosimilar medicines up to date.{{when|date=December 2019}}{{citation needed|date=December 2019}} The EMA's scientific committees evaluate the majority of marketing authorization applications for biosimilar medicines before they can be approved and marketed in the EU. The EMA evaluates biosimilars according to the same standards of pharmaceutical quality, safety and efficacy that apply to all biological medicines approved in the EU.

===BPCI Act===
The [[Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009|Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act]] of 2009 (BPCI Act) was originally sponsored and introduced on June 26, 2007, by Senator [[Ted Kennedy|Edward Kennedy]] (D-MA).  It was formally passed under the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] (PPAC Act), signed into law by President Barack Obama on March 23, 2010. The BPCI Act was an amendment to the Public Health Service Act (PHS Act) to create an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products that are demonstrated to be highly similar (biosimilar) to a [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) approved biological product. The BPCI Act is similar, conceptually, to the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (also referred to as the "Hatch-Waxman Act") which created biological drug approval through the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFD&C Act). The BPCI Act aligns with the FDA's longstanding policy of permitting appropriate reliance on what is already known about a drug, thereby saving time and resources and avoiding unnecessary duplication of human or animal testing. The FDA has released a total of four draft guidelines related to biosimilar or follow-on biologics development. Upon the release of the first three guidance documents the FDA held a public hearing on May 11, 2012.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Epstein MS, Ehrenpreis ED, Kulkarni PM | title = Biosimilars: the need, the challenge, the future: the FDA perspective | journal = The American Journal of Gastroenterology | volume = 109 | issue = 12 | pages = 1856–9 | date = December 2014 | pmid = 24957160 | doi = 10.1038/ajg.2014.151 | s2cid = 19274464 | url = http://gi.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/FDA_Biosimilars_December_2014.pdf | access-date = 2016-09-25 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20161006151227/http://gi.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/FDA_Biosimilars_December_2014.pdf | archive-date = 2016-10-06 | url-status = dead }}</ref>

In 2018, the FDA released a Biosimilars Action Plan to implement regulations from the BPCI, including limiting the abuse of the Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) system for [[evergreening]] and transitioning insulin and human growth hormone to regulation as biologics rather than drugs.<ref>{{Cite press release|url=https://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm628121.htm|title=Statement from FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, M.D., on new actions advancing the agency's biosimilars policy framework |website=U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA)|access-date=2018-12-16}}</ref>

=== Nomenclature ===
In Europe no unique identifier of a biosimilar medicine product is required, same rules are followed as for all biologics. For identifying and tracing biological medicines in the EU, medicines have to be distinguished by the tradename and batch number and this is particularly important in cases where more than one medicine with the same INN exists on the market. This ensures that, in line with EU requirements for ADR reporting, the medicine can be correctly identified if any product-specific safety (or immunogenicity) concern arises.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Biosimilars in the EU: Information guide for healthcare professionals |url = https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/leaflet/biosimilars-eu-information-guide-healthcare-professionals_en.pdf|access-date = 2019-08-02}}</ref>
The report 1 of the May 2017 WHO Expert Consultation on Improving Access to and Use of Similar Biotherapeutic Products, published in October 2017, revealed on page 4, that following the outcome arising from the meeting: "No consensus was reached on whether WHO should continue with the BQ...WHO will not be proceeding with this at present."<ref>{{Cite web|title = WHO Report on the Expert Consultation on Improving Access to and Use of Similar Biotherapeutic Products |url = https://www.who.int/medicines/access/biotherapeutics/FINAL_Report-improving-access-to-and-use-of-biotherapeutics_October2017.pdf|access-date = 2019-08-02}}</ref>
On 14 February 2019, Health Canada announced the decision that both the brand name and non-proprietary name should be used throughout the medication use process. Biologics that share the same non-proprietary name can be distinguished by their unique brand names .<ref>{{Cite web|title = Notice to Stakeholders - Policy Statement on the Naming of Biologic Drugs |url = https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/drugs-health-products/biologics-radiopharmaceuticals-genetic-therapies/biosimilar-biologic-notice-to-stakeholders-drugs-naming-of-biologics.html|access-date = 2019-08-02}}</ref>
The US decided on a different approach, being only jurisdiction requiring the assignment of a four character alphabetic suffix to the nonproprietary name of the original product to distinguish between innovator drugs and their biosimilars.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Nonproprietary Naming of Biological Products; Draft Guidance for Industry; Availability|url = https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/nonproprietary-naming-biological-products-update-guidance-industry|website = U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA)|access-date = 2018-08-02 }}</ref>

=== Proposed reforms ===
In the United States, biosimilars have not had the expected impact on prices, leading a 2019 proposal to price regulate instead after an exclusivity period.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.statnews.com/2019/04/15/peter-bachs-latest-crazy-idea-give-up-on-biosimilars-regulate-drug-prices-instead/|title=Peter Bach's crazy idea: Give up on biosimilars.

In 2019, the proposed Biologic Patent Transparency Act would help address [[evergreening]] "[[patent thicket]]s" by requiring that all patents protecting a biosimilar be disclosed.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.natlawreview.com/article/will-biologic-patent-transparency-act-shrink-biosimilar-patent-dance-floor|title=Will The Biologic Patent Transparency Act Shrink The Biosimilar Patent Dance Floor?|website=The National Law Review|access-date=2019-05-16}}</ref>

The legal requirements of approval pathways, together with the costly manufacturing processes, escalates the developing costs for biosimilars that could be between $75–$250 million per molecule.<ref name=biosimilars>{{cite journal | vauthors = Calo-Fernández B, Martínez-Hurtado JL | title = Biosimilars: company strategies to capture value from the biologics market | journal = Pharmaceuticals | volume = 5 | issue = 12 | pages = 1393–408 | date = December 2012 | pmid = 24281342 | pmc = 3816668 | doi = 10.3390/ph5121393 }}</ref> This market entry barrier affects not only the companies willing to produce them but could also delay availability of inexpensive alternatives for public healthcare institutions that subsidize treatment for their patients. Even though the biosimilars market is rising, the price drop for biological drugs at risk of patent expiration will not be as great as for other generic drugs; in fact it has been estimated that the price for biosimilar products will be 65%-85% of their originators.<ref name=biosimilars /> Biosimilars are drawing market's attention since there is an upcoming [[patent cliff]], which will put nearly 36% of the $140 billion market for biologic drugs at risk (as of 2011), this considering only the top 10 selling products.<ref name=biosimilars />

The global biosimilars market was {{US$|1.3 billion}} in 2013 and is expected to reach {{US$|35 billion}} by 2020 driven by the [[patent expiration]] of additional ten blockbuster biologic drugs.<ref name="urlBiosimilars and Follow-on-Biologics Market to Hit $35 Billion Globally by 2020 | Pharmaceutical Technology">{{cite web | url = http://www.pharmtech.com/biosimilars-and-follow-biologics-market-hit-35-billion-globally-2020 | title = Biosimilars and Follow-on-Biologics Market to Hit $35 Billion Globally by 2020 | work = Pharmaceutical Technology | date = 28 August 2015 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.clinicalleader.com/doc/important-considerations-when-sourcing-reference-products-for-biosimilar-studies-0001|title=Important Considerations When Sourcing Reference Products For Biosimilar Studies|last=Bali|first=Vikram|date=May 25, 2017|work=Clinical Leader|access-date=17 Dec 2019|publisher=VertMarkets|quote=As a  slew of the most important, most widely-used and accepted biologics have their patents expire this decade, the biosimilar market is predicted to leap from $1.36 billion in 2013 to over $35 billion by 2020 (Allied Market Research).}}</ref>{{clear}}

== Companies ==

Certain companies (in some cases subsidiaries) tend to operate as [[:Category:Generic drug manufacturers|generic drug manufacturers]], with major ones including [[Teva Pharmaceutical Industries|Teva]], [[Mylan]], and Sandoz<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thebalance.com/top-generic-drug-companies-2663110|title=What Are the Top Generic Drug Companies?|last=Stone|first=Kathlyn|website=The Balance|access-date=2019-05-18}}</ref> and may also extend that focus to biosimilars. Sandoz, for example, introduced the first biosimilar in the United States, and plans to introduce another in 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.biopharma-reporter.com/Article/2019/02/11/Sandoz-readies-insulin-biosimilars-for-US|title=Biosimilar entry into US insulin market will see 'millions more patients treated'|last=biopharma-reporter.com|website=biopharma-reporter.com|access-date=2019-05-18}}</ref> Newer companies such as India-based [[Cadila Pharmaceuticals]], [[Sun Pharmaceutical|Sun Pharma]], [[Aurobindo Pharma]], and [[Dr. Reddy's Laboratories]] as well as Canada-based [[Apotex]] have taken share in traditional generics, which has led older companies to shift their focus to complex drugs such as biosimilars.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fiercepharma.com/pharma/generics-old-guard-pack-yields-u-s-scripts-lead-to-next-6-led-by-indian-firms-analyst|title='Old guard' generics players yield U.S. lead to Indian up-and-comers: analyst|website=FiercePharma|access-date=2019-05-18}}</ref>
