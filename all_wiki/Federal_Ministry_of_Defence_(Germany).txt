==History==
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2009}} 
{{see also|Ministry of the Reichswehr}}

From the [[Unification of Germany]] in 1871 until the end of [[World War I]], the [[German Empire]] did not have a national [[Ministry of War]]. Instead the larger German states (such as the kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]], [[Kingdom of Bavaria|Bavaria]], [[Kingdom of Saxony|Saxony]] and [[Kingdom of Württemberg|Württemberg]]), insisting on their autonomy, each had an own war ministry. According to the military agreements the Prussian minister president [[Otto von Bismarck]] had forged with the South German states on the eve of the [[Franco-Prussian War]] of 1870/71, the major states were responsible also for the defence of the smaller states. However, the [[Kaiserliche Marine|Imperial Navy]] from 1889 was overseen by a federal department, the [[German Imperial Naval Office|Imperial Naval Office]].
[[File:Berlin, Tiergarten, Reichpietschufer, Bendler-Block 02.jpg|thumb|left|Bendlerblock, Berlin-Tiergarten, secondary seat since 1993]]
After the war and the [[German Revolution of 1918–19]], the [[Weimar Constitution]] provided for a unified, national ministry of defence, which was created largely from the [[Prussian Minister of War|Prussian Ministry of War]] and the Imperial Naval Office. The [[Ministry of the Reichswehr]] was established in October 1919, and had its seat in the [[Bendlerblock]] building.

In the context of the [[Treaty of Versailles]] and the "Law for the Creation of a provisional [[Reichswehr]]" of March 1919, the Reichspräsident became the Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces, whilst the Reich Minister of Defence exercised military authority. Only in the [[Free State of Prussia]] did military authority remain with the State Minister of War. After the Weimar Constitution came into force, the remaining war ministries in the states of Bavaria, Saxony, Württemberg and Prussia were abolished and military authority was concentrated in the [[German Reich|Reich]] Minister of Defence. Command was exercised respectively by the Chief of the ''Heeresleitung'' (Army Command) and the Chief of the ''Marineleitung'' (Navy Command, see ''[[Reichsmarine]]''). In 1929 a third office was established: the Ministerial Office, whose Chief functioned as the political representative of the Minister. The role of the General Staff was filled by the ''Truppenamt''.

The [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic]] politician [[Gustav Noske]] became the first Minister of Defence of Germany. After the Nazi ''[[Machtergreifung]]'', when the ''Reichswehr'' was recreated as the [[Wehrmacht]] in 1935, the ministry was renamed ''Reichskriegsministerium'' (Reich Ministry of War); also, the ''Heeresleitung'' became the [[Oberkommando des Heeres]] (OKH), the ''Marineleitung'' became the [[Oberkommando der Marine]] (OKM) and the [[Oberkommando der Luftwaffe]] (OKL) was newly created. The ''Ministeramt'' (Ministerial Office) was renamed the ''Wehrmachtsamt''.

In 1938, following the [[Blomberg-Fritsch Affair]], Hitler himself exercised the functions of the Reich War Minister. The ''Wehrmachtsamt'' was turned into the [[Oberkommando der Wehrmacht]] (OKW; High Command of the Armed Forces), which formally existed until the end of [[World War II]]. The High Command was not a government ministry, but a military command, however.

After World War II, [[West Germany]] started with preparations for rearmament (''[[Wiederbewaffnung]]'') in 1950, as ordered by Chancellor [[Konrad Adenauer]]. After the outbreak of the [[Korean War]], the [[United States]] called for a West German contribution to the defence of Western Europe (against the [[Soviet Union]]). Initially [[Gerhard Graf von Schwerin]], a former Wehrmacht General, advised the Chancellor on these issues and led the preparations, but after Count Schwerin had talked to the press about his work, he was replaced by [[Theodor Blank]], who was appointed as "Special Representative" of the Chancellor. As the rearmament plans met with harsh opposition by a wide circle within the West German population and contradicted the [[occupation statute]], the government office responsible for the rearmament acted secretly, unofficially known as ''Amt Blank''. By 1955, the number of employees had surpassed 1,300. On 7 June 1955 the office became the Ministry of Defence, or ''Bundesministerium für Verteidigung'' in German. The [[Bundeswehr]] was established and Germany joined the [[NATO]] the same year. In 1956, Germany reintroduced [[Conscription in Germany|conscription]], and the German military force quickly became the largest conventional military force in Western Europe. To confirm the ministry's importance, it was renamed ''Bundesministerium '''der''' Verteidigung'' on 30 December 1961, similar to the German names of the "classic" ministries of [[Federal Ministry of Finance (Germany)|Finance]], [[Federal Ministry of the Interior (Germany)|the Interior]] and [[Federal Ministry of Justice (Germany)|Justice]] &mdash; though the federal minister is still denoted as ''Bundesminister '''für''' Verteidigung'' in Article 65a of the German Constitution.

Until 1960, the ministry had its seat in the Ermekeil barracks in Bonn. From 1960 onwards, it was moved to a new building complex at Hardthöhe. After [[German reunification]], the Bendlerblock, former seat of its Weimar Republic predecessor, became the secondary seat of the ministry in 1993.

The German military has become increasingly engaged in international operations since the early 1990s, and saw combat in the 1999 [[1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia|Kosovo War]] against [[Yugoslavia]]. Currently, Germany has a large deployment in [[Afghanistan]] and other deployments around the world.
