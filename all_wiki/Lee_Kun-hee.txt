'''Lee Kun-hee''' ({{Korean|hangul = 이건희 |hanja={{Lang|ko|李健熙}}}}, {{IPA-ko|iːɡʌnɣi|lang}}; 9 January 1942{{spnd}}25 October 2020) was a South Korean businessman who served as chairman of the [[Samsung Group]] from 1987 to 2008 and from 2010 to 2020, and is credited with the transformation of Samsung to the world's largest manufacturer of smartphones, televisions, and memory chips. He was also a member of the [[International Olympic Committee]]. He was the third son of Samsung founder [[Lee Byung-chul]]. With an estimated net worth of US$21&nbsp;billion at the time of his death, he was the richest person in South Korea, a position that he had held since 2007.

He was convicted twice, once in 1996 and subsequently in 2008, for corruption and tax evasion charges, but was pardoned on both instances. In 2014, Lee was named the world's 35th most powerful person and the most powerful Korean by ''Forbes''<nowiki/>'s [[Forbes list of The World's Most Powerful People|list of the world's most powerful people]] along with his son, [[Lee Jae-yong (businessman)|Lee Jae-yong]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/powerful-people/list/#tab:overall|title=The World's Most Powerful People|publisher=|access-date=2 September 2017 |archive-date=25 December 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181225092237/https://www.forbes.com/powerful-people/list/#tab:overall|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Career==

===First period at Samsung===
Lee joined the [[Samsung Group]] in 1966 with the [[Tongyang Broadcasting Company]], and later went on to work for Samsung's construction and trading company.<ref name=":1" />

He took over the chairmanship of the conglomerate on 24 December 1987, two weeks after the death of his father, [[Lee Byung-chul]].<ref name="Founded">{{Cite web |url=https://www.theverge.com/2012/11/30/3709688/samsung-25-years-lee-kun-hee |title=King of Samsung: a chairman's reign of cunning and corruption |last=Byford |first=Sam |date=30 November 2012 |access-date=27 September 2018 |archive-date=2 December 2012  |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121202005425/https://www.theverge.com/2012/11/30/3709688/samsung-25-years-lee-kun-hee |url-status=live }}</ref> In 1993, believing that [[Samsung Group]] was overly focused on producing large quantities of low-quality goods and was not prepared to compete in quality, Lee famously said, "Change everything except your wife and kids".<ref>{{Cite web|last=Moore|first=James|date=8 October 2011|title=The business on...Lee Kun-hee, Chairman, Samsung|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/analysis-and-features/the-business-onlee-kun-hee-chairman-samsung-2367402.html|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180225042305/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/analysis-and-features/the-business-onlee-kun-hee-chairman-samsung-2367402.html|archive-date=25 February 2018 |access-date=25 October 2020|website=[[The Independent]]|language=en}}</ref> This call was an attempt to drive innovation at the company and to face up to the competition at that time from rivals like [[SONY Corporation|Sony Corporation]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|date=25 October 2020|title=Lee Kun-hee, Korean Icon Who Transformed Samsung, Dies at 78|language=en|work=Bloomberg.com|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-25/samsung-electronics-says-chairman-lee-kun-hee-has-died|access-date=25 October 2020}}</ref> In a declaration now known as the '[[Frankfurt]] Declaration', he had his executives gather in the German city in 1993 and called for a change in the company's approach to quality, even if it meant lower sales. The company went on to become the largest manufacturer of televisions beating Sony corporation in 2006.<ref name=":0" />

===Scandals and controversies===
Lee was convicted for having paid bribes to president [[Roh Tae-woo]] in 1996. He was subsequently pardoned by president [[Kim Young-sam]].<ref name=":0" />

On 14 January 2008, Korean police raided Lee's home and office in an ongoing probe into accusations that Samsung was responsible for a slush fund used to bribe influential prosecutors, judges, and political figures in South Korea.<ref>[http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/01/14/business/samsung.php] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080117233025/http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/01/14/business/samsung.php |date=17 January 2008}}</ref> On 4 April 2008, Lee denied allegations against him in the scandal.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://english.hani.co.kr/arti/english_edition/e_national/281425.html |title=Samsung chairman hints at possible resignation : National : Home |language=ko |publisher=English.hani.co.kr |date= |accessdate=28 December 2010 |archive-date=6 March 2009  |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090306001212/http://english.hani.co.kr/arti/english_edition/e_national/281425.html |url-status=live}}</ref> After a second round of questioning by the South Korean prosecutors, on 11 April 2008, Lee was quoted by reporters as saying, "I am responsible for everything.

On 16 July 2008, ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported the Seoul Central District Court had found Lee guilty on charges of financial wrongdoing and tax evasion. Prosecutors requested that Lee be sentenced to seven years in prison and fined 350&nbsp;billion won (approximately US$312&nbsp;million). The court fined him 110&nbsp;billion won (approximately US$98&nbsp;million) and gave him a three-years suspended sentence. However, on 29 December 2009, South Korean president [[Lee Myung-bak]] pardoned Lee, stating that the intent of the pardon was to allow Lee to remain on the [[International Olympic Committee]].<ref name="The Verge" /> In Lee Myung-bak's corruption trial, this pardon was revealed to have been in exchange for bribes; further bribery and other political corruption between former President Lee and Lee Kun-hee was also exposed.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Sang-Hun |first1=Choe |title=Former South Korean President Gets 15 Years in Prison for Corruption |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/05/world/asia/lee-myung-bak-south-korea-convicted.html |accessdate=31 October 2019 |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=5 October 2018 |archive-date=3 November 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191103084240/https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/05/world/asia/lee-myung-bak-south-korea-convicted.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

''Think Samsung'', a 2010 book by Kim Yong-chul, former Samsung legal counsel, alleged that Lee was guilty of corruption. In particular, it claimed that he stole up to 10&nbsp;trillion won (approximately US$8.9&nbsp;billion) from Samsung subsidiaries, tampered with evidence, and bribed government officials to guarantee his son would succeed him.<ref name="The Verge" />

===Return to Samsung===
On 24 March 2010, Lee announced his return to Samsung Electronics as its chairman.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/tech/2019/05/693_62923.html|title=Lee Kun-hee Returns to Samsung Helm|date=24 March 2010|website=koreatimes|accessdate=13 May 2019|archive-date=13 May 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190513225040/http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/tech/2019/05/693_62923.html|url-status=live}}</ref> He continued in this position until 2014, when he suffered an incapacitating heart attack and his son, Lee Jae-yong, became the Samsung group's de facto leader.<ref>"[https://www.britannica.com/biography/Lee-Kun-Hee Lee Kun-hee] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150918213215/https://www.britannica.com/biography/Lee-Kun-Hee |date=18 September 2015}}". Encyclopedia Britannica. Retrieved 5 April 2020.</ref> He is credited with having transformed Samsung into the world's largest manufacturer of smartphones, televisions, and memory chips.<ref name=":0" /> At the time of his death, the company was worth US$300&nbsp;billion, and with an estimated net worth US$20.7&nbsp;billion per Bloomberg's billionaire index, he was the richest person in South Korea; a position that he had held since 2007.<ref>{{Cite news|date=25 October 2020|title=Lee Kun-hee, Korean Icon Who Transformed Samsung, Dies at 78|language=en|work=Bloomberg.com|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-25/samsung-electronics-says-chairman-lee-kun-hee-has-died|access-date=25 October 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Chung|first=Grace|title=Lee Kun-Hee, Legendary Head Of Samsung And Korea’s Richest Man, Dies At 78|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/gracechung/2020/10/24/lee-kun-hee-legendary-head-of-samsung-and-koreas-richest-man-dies-at-78/|access-date=25 October 2020|website=Forbes|language=en}}</ref>

Following his death, Lee's heirs are expected to face an estate tax of around US$10&nbsp;billion, which might potentially result in dilution of the family's stake in the conglomerate. This stems from South Korea's high [[estate tax]] of 50% for estates larger than US$3&nbsp;billion, which is second only to Japan, amongst the [[OECD|OECD countries.]]<ref name=":0" />
