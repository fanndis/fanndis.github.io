==Reception==

===Critical reception===
"Run This Town" received mixed reviews from music critics. Following the leak of the song, Tom Breihan, [[Pitchfork (website)|''Pitchfork'']] gave a positive review. "The new Jay-Z/Rihanna/Kanye West track from 'The Blueprint 3', leaked this morning, and it bangs. Jay's '[[D.O.A. (Death of Auto-Tune)]]' left the impression that The Blueprint 3 might be a cantankerous grumpy-old-man rap album, but 'Run This Town' totally obliterates that. Thanks to a molten motivational Rihanna chorus, it's pop-friendly as hell, without compromising Jay's fundamental hardness. And Jay is actually rapping like he cares, something he's only done intermittently over the last few years. Still, Kanye gets the hottest line on the song: 'What you think I rap for, to push a fuckin' RAV 4?'"<ref>{{cite web|url= http://pitchfork.com/news/36023-listen-jay-z-run-this-town-ft-rihanna-kanye-west/ | title= Listen: Jay-Z: "Run This Town [ft. Rihanna & Kanye West]|work=Pitchfork Media|date=2012-04-09 |accessdate=2009-07-24}}</ref> Following the album's release, Pitchfork made another review of the song, again praising the track. "There's something for everybody: Jay [-Z] sounds engaged in a way he rarely has since unretiring, [[Rihanna]] coos those "ay ay"s the radio loves, and Kanye West, as you may have read, once again upstages the guy he's producing. Rihanna's hook may not be Auto-Tune'd, but it's definitely autopilot."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/11416-run-this-town-ft-rihanna-and-kanye-west | title=Run This Town Music Review|work=Pitchfork Media|date=2009-09-19 |accessdate=2009-09-19}}</ref>

[[About.com]] felt that Jay-Z lacked presence, writing, "It looks like someone finally got tired of being bullied by '[[Big Brother (Kanye West song)|Big Brother]]'. Roc Nation dropped the ball on the song credit though; it was supposed to read 'Kanye West Featuring Rihanna,' because 'Ye murdered Jay on his own track. But that's not saying much because Jay was running this race on one foot. In other words, Kanye didn't win, Jay lost".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rap.about.com/od/songreviews/gr/JayZRunThisTown.htm|title= Top 25 Pop Artists Right Now|publisher=About.com|date=2009-09-19 |accessdate=2009-09-19}}</ref> [[Digital Spy]] gave a mixed review of the song. "Boasting three of the biggest stars from the worlds of hip-hop and R&B, 'Run This Town' was never going to be a flop, but neither is it a roaring success. Kanye's slick rapping ("Reebok baby, you need to try some new things, have you ever had shoes without shoestrings?") and Rihanna's "hey-hey" chorus hook make Jay-Z seem surplus to requirements, which surely can't have been the aim. The chaotic military march beats are impressive – and hats off to Jigga for snubbing Auto-Tune – but this track still doesn't seem fitting of an artist considered a groundbreaking rap legend.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/a175370/jay-z-ft-rihanna-kanye-west-run-this-town.html | title=Run This Town|publisher=DigitalSpy|date=2009-09-19 |accessdate=2009-09-19}}</ref>

===Accolades===
Most notably, "Run This Town" was nominated for [[Grammy Award for Best Rap Song|Best Rap Song]] and [[Best Rap/Sung Collaboration]] at the [[52nd Grammy Awards]] in 2010. It eventually won both awards, marking Jay-Z's tenth and Rihanna's third and Kanye West's fourteenth win at the ceremony awards in total. The song also managed to win an [[Emmy Awards|Emmy Award]] for 'Outstanding Music Composition/Direction/Lyrics', during [[Super Bowl XLIV]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://m.complex.com/music/2011/05/jay-z-emmy-run-this-town | title=Jay-Z Wins Emmy for "Run This Town"|publisher=complex.com|date=2011-05-03}}</ref>

==Music video==
===Background===
The video for "Run This Town" was directed by [[Anthony Mandler]] and was filmed on August 6, 2009 at [[Fort Totten (New York)|Fort Totten]] Park in [[New York City]]. Mandler explained the production behind the video saying:

<blockquote>"There's a tone and feeling to the song, there's a militia, a march and a kind of rambunctious energy to it that, for me, I immediately wanted to tap into. I showed [Jay] some references from the classic rebellious zones of the world. We live in very orderly society in America, but when you get into Brazil, you get into the Middle East, you get into Africa, you get into Eastern Europe, when you get into places like that, there's a different sort of 'we run this town' [going on]. There's less order and more chaos. So we looked at a lot of those references, new photos and historical photos, to capture that kind of falling-apart feeling." "We wanted you to feel uneasy throughout the piece," he said. "We wanted there to be a constant layer of tension through the piece. Even in the way I shot — where the camera comes by Jay, it doesn't stop on him, it goes to Rihanna — there's kind of this chaos of revealing and covering and concealing. And things happen offscreen that you don't see. I think people are really gonna flip on this".</blockquote>

The video was leaked on August 19, 2009, by [[MTV Germany]]. It premiered officially on August 20 on [[MTV]], as well other MTV channels across the world. The video was released to iTunes on August 25, 2009.

===Synopsis and reception===
The music video involves crowds of protesters in masks, holding torches whilst walking. Rihanna takes a bandanna from covering her mouth and performs the intro of the song in a park area with explosions firing around her. Jay-Z then begins the second verse while in a temple-like area. Kanye West sings his verse in a cave-like area holding a torch and having a bandanna cover his face like Jay-Z and Rihanna. Throughout the video, the trio are on a stage platform with the mob of protesters previously shown surrounding them.

Daniel Kreps of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' called the video, "a civilization that takes Jigga's lyrical motif of 'all black everything' very seriously." He further added, "When we first heard 'Run This Town', we pictured Jay-Z and his posse staging a siege on [[Manhattan]], or at least going to all the VIP spots most civilians only dream about like in the "[[D.O.A. (Death of Auto-Tune)|D.O.A. (Death of Autotune)]]" video. Instead, we're introduced to a [[Mad Max]]-like landscape full of proto-biker gear, torches, face scarves and bombed-out buildings. Jay-Z and his gang of ruffians actually look like they're on a mission to slay Auto-Tune. Also, according to the video, Rihanna is the only female to survive the apocalypse, and West's verse about [[Reebok]]s, [[Rav4]]s and girls with two bee stings seem starkly out of place in the dismal future."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/jay-z-rihanna-kanye-wests-dark-run-this-town-video-debuts-20090820|title=Jay-Z, Rihanna, Kanye West's Dark "Run This Town" Video Debuts|publisher=Rolling Stone.
