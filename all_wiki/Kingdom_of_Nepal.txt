During this period, [[Nepal]] was formally under the rule of the [[Shah dynasty]], which exercised varying degrees of power during the kingdom's existence.

After the invasion of [[Tibet]] and plundering of Digarcha by Nepali forces under [[Bahadur Shah of Nepal|Prince Regent Bahadur Shah]] in 1792, the [[8th Dalai Lama|Dalai Lama]] and Chinese Ambans reported to the Chinese administration for military support. The Chinese and Tibetan forces under [[Fuk'anggan]] attacked Nepal but went for negotiations after failure at Nuwakot.<ref name="nepalarmythree">{{Cite web|url=http://www.nepalarmy.mil.np/history.php?page=three|title=Nepal and Tibetan conflict|publisher=Official website of Nepal Army}}</ref> ''Mulkaji'' [[Damodar Pande]], who was the most influential among the four [[Kaji (Nepal)|Kajis]], was appointed after removal of Bahadur Shah.

However, on 4 March 1804, the former king came back and took over as ''[[Mukhtiyar]]'' (premier) and Damodar Pande was then beheaded in Thankot.<ref>[http://countrystudies.us/nepal/10.htm Nepal:The Struggle for Power] (Sourced to [[U.S. Library of Congress]])</ref> The [[1806 Bhandarkhal massacre]] instigated upon the death of Rana Bahadur Shah, set forth the rise of authoritative ''Mukhtiyar'' [[Bhimsen Thapa]],{{sfn|Acharya|2012|pp=71-72}} who became the ''de facto'' ruler of [[Nepal]] from 1806 to 1837.{{sfn|Whelpton|1991|p=21}} During the early nineteenth century, however, the expansion of the [[East India Company]]'s [[Company rule in India|rule in India]] led to the [[Anglo-Nepalese War]] (1814–1816), which resulted in Nepal's defeat. Under the [[Treaty of Sugauli]], the kingdom retained its independence, but in exchange for territorial concessions marking the rivers [[Mechi River|Mechi]] and [[Sharda River|Mahakali]] as the boundary of Nepalese territories.<ref name="nepalarmytwo"/> The territory of the kingdom before the Sugauli treaty is sometimes referred to as ''[[Greater Nepal]]''. In the political scenario, the death of ''Mukhtiyar'' [[Mathabarsingh Thapa|Mathbar Singh]] ended the [[Thapa dynasty|Thapa hegemony]] and set the stage for The [[Kot massacre]].{{sfn|Acharya|2012|pp=11–12}} This resulted in the ascendancy of the [[Rana dynasty]] of [[Chhetri|Khas Rajput (Chhetri)]] and made the office of the [[Prime Minister of Nepal]] hereditary in their family for the next century, from 1843 to 1951. Beginning with [[Jung Bahadur Rana|Jung Bahadur]], the first Rana ruler, the Rana dynasty reduced the Shah monarch to a figurehead role. Rana rule was marked by tyranny, debauchery, economic exploitation and religious persecution.<ref>{{cite news|last=Dietrich|first=Angela|title=Buddhist Monks and Rana Rulers: A History of Persecution|url=http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-BH/bh117536.htm|access-date=17 September 2013|newspaper=Buddhist Himalaya: A Journal of Nagarjuna Institute of Exact Methods|year=1996|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131001124156/http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-BH/bh117536.htm|archive-date=1 October 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last= Lal |first=C.

In July 1950, the newly independent [[India|republic of India]] signed a [[1950 Indo-Nepal Treaty of Peace and Friendship|friendship treaty]] in which both nations agreed to respect the other's sovereignty. In November of the same year, India played an important role in supporting [[Tribhuvan of Nepal|King Tribhuhvan]], whom the Rana leader [[Mohan Shumsher Jang Bahadur Rana]] had attempted to depose and replace with his infant grandson [[Gyanendra of Nepal|King Gyanendra]]. With Indian support for a new government consisting largely of the [[Nepali Congress]], King Tribhuvan ended the Rana regime in 1951.

Unsuccessful attempts were made to implement reforms and adopt a constitution during the 1960s and 1970s. An economic crisis at the end of the 1980s led to a popular movement which brought about parliamentary elections and the adoption of a constitutional monarchy in 1990. The 1990s saw the beginning of the [[Nepalese Civil War]] (1996–2006), a conflict between government forces and the insurgent forces of the [[Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist Centre)|Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist)]]. The situation for the Nepalese monarchy was further destabilised by the 2001 [[Nepalese royal massacre]]. [[Dipendra of Nepal|Crown Prince Dipendra]] reportedly shot and killed ten people, including his father [[Birendra of Nepal|King Birendra]], and was himself mortally wounded by an alleged, self-inflicted gunshot.

As a result of the massacre, King Gyanendra returned to the throne. His imposition of direct rule in 2005 provoked a [[2006 Nepalese revolution|protest movement]] unifying the [[Maoism|Maoist]] insurgency and pro-democracy activists. He was eventually forced to restore the [[House of Representatives (Nepal)|House of Representatives]], which in 2007 adopted an interim constitution greatly restricting the powers of the Nepalese monarchy. Following an [[2008 Nepalese Constituent Assembly election|election held the next year]], the [[1st Nepalese Constituent Assembly|Nepalese Constituent Assembly]] formally abolished the kingdom in its first session on 28 May 2008, declaring the [[Nepal|Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal]] in its place.

Until the abolition of the monarchy, Nepal was the world's only country to have [[Hinduism]] as its [[state religion]]; since becoming a republic, the country is now formally a [[secular state]].<ref>[http://www.theindiapost.com/2009/10/28/why-monarchy-is-necessary-in-nepal/ Why Monarchy is necessary in Nepal?]</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.religiousintelligence.co.uk/news/?NewsID=1471 |date= 18 January 2008 |author=George Conger |work=Religious Intelligence |title=Nepal moves to become a secular republic |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090130031409/http://www.religiousintelligence.co.uk/news/?NewsID=1471 |archive-date=30 January 2009}}</ref>

The actual historical process however by which this migration took place and the history of the Gorkhalis' ultimate conquest of Nepal span a couple of centuries and are drastically different from what Chauhan{{Who|date=August 2020}} proposes. More importantly, Chauhan's overall thesis claiming the existence of a Gurkha identity way before the Shahs came to the Nepali hills is not supported by historical evidence available in Nepal. In Nepal the warrior people are not referred to as 'Gurkhas', they are called 'Gorkhalis', meaning the 'inhabitants of Gorkha.' Their famed battle cry is ''<nowiki/>'Ayo Gorkhali''', meaning 'the Gorkhalis have come.'{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

The etymology of the geographical name 'Gorkha' is indeed related to the Hindu mendicant-saint [[Gorakshanath|Gorakhnath]]. In the village of Gorkha is situated a temple dedicated to Gorakhnath as well as another dedicated to Gorakhkali, a corresponding female deity. The Nepali geographical encyclopedia ''<nowiki/>'Mechi dekhi Mahakali''' (From Mechi to Mahakali) published in [[Vikram Samvat|B.S.]] 2013 (1974-75 AD) by the authoritarian Panchayat government to mark the coronation of King Birendra Shah agrees with the association of the name of the place with the saint but does not add any further detail.<ref name="Mechi-dekhi Mahakali p. 70">'Mechi-dekhi Mahakali, Vol. 3, Paschimanchal Bikas Kshetra' p. 70</ref> The facts regarding when the temples were built and the place named after the saint are lost in the sweeping winds of time. We may guess that these developments took place in the early part of the second millennium of the Common Era following the rise of the Nath sect. In fact, the pilgrimage circuit of the sect across the northern Indian sub-continent also spans a major part of present-day Nepal including Kathmandu Valley. The [[Newar people|Newars]] of Medieval Nepal have a couple of important temples and festivals dedicated to the major Nath teachers. Immediately before the rule of Gorkha by the Shahs, Gorkha was inhabited by both Aryan and Mongoloid ethnic groups and ruled by the Khadkas, who were probably of [[Khas people|Khas]] origin. Dravya Shah defeated the Khadkas in 1559 AD and commenced Shah rule over the principality.<ref name= "Mechi-dekhi Mahakali p. 70"/> Prithvi Narayan Shah belonged to the ninth generation of the Shahs in Gorkha. He took the reins of power in 1742 AD.<ref>Sharma, Devi Prasad, ''Adhunik Nepal-ko Itihas (1742–1961 AD).'' [[Ratna Pustak Bhandar]]. Kathmandu. 1995.</ref>

===Battle of Nuwakot===
[[File:Bamshidhar Kalu Pande.jpg|thumb|''Kaji'' [[Kalu Pande|Vamshidhar "Kalu" Pande]]; commander of Gorkhali forces at victorious battle of Nuwakot]]
The first battle by Gorkhali forces united under King Prithvi Narayan Shah was the Battle of Nuwakot. The first army commander was ''Kaji'' Kalu Pande of the Pande noble family of Gorkha. Pande put up tactics to attack Nuwakot, a strategic fort of [[Malla (Kathmandu Valley)|Malla king of Kathmandu]], from multiple sides by surprise. On 26 September 1744, Pande with a contingent of soldiers climbed from the northern side of Nuwakot city at Mahamandal. He led the surprise attack with a Gorkhali war cry of ''"Jai [[Kali]], Jai [[Gorakhnath]], Jai [[Manakamana Temple|Manakamana]]"''.{{sfn|Hamal|1995|p=98}} The panicked soldiers of Nuwakot under commander Shankha Mani tried to defend but lost after their commander was killed by the 13-year-old [[Dal Mardan Shah|Prince Dal Mardan Shah]], brother of the king.<ref name="nepalarmy">https://www.nepalarmy.mil.np/page/history</ref> The second contingent of Gorkhali forces led by ''Chautariya'' Mahoddam Kirti Shah (also a brother of the king) passed Dharampani and faced strong tussle but ultimately won over the defenders.<ref name="nepalarmy"/> The third part of the forces, led by the king himself, advanced to the fort of Nuwakotgadhi after the capture of Mahamandal. The soldiers panicked by death of their commander fled to Belkot from the Nuwakot fort and Nuwakot was annexed by Gorkha.<ref name="nepalarmy"/>

===Battle of Kirtipur===
{{Main|Battle of Kirtipur}}
[[File:Gorkha3.jpg|thumb|Gorkhali soldiers preparing war against Kathmandu Valley]]
Despite his initial resentment that the valley kings were well prepared and the Gorkhalis were not, ''Kaji'' Kalu Pande agreed for a battle against the kingdom of [[Kirtipur]] in the [[Kathmandu valley]] on being insisted by the king. The Gorkhalis had set up a base in Naikap to mount their assaults on Kirtipur. They were armed with swords, bows and arrows and [[musket]]s.<ref>Vansittart, Eden (1896). ''Notes on Nepal''. Asian Educational Services. {{ISBN|978-81-206-0774-3}}. Page 34.</ref> The two forces fought on the plain of ''Tyangla Phant'' in the northwest of Kirtipur. Surapratap Shah, the king's brother, lost his right eye to an arrow while scaling the city wall.

In response, the three kings of the valley joined forces and sent their troops to the relief of Kirtipur, but they could not dislodge the Gorkhalis from their positions. A noble of Lalitpur named Danuvanta crossed over to Shah's side and treacherously let the Gorkhalis into the town.<ref name="Kirkpatrick 1811"/><ref>{{cite news|title= The city of good deeds |url= http://nepalitimes.com/issue/18/Culture/9018|access-date=18 October 2012|newspaper= Nepali Times |date=24–30 November 2000}}</ref>

===Annexation of Makwanpur & Hariharpur===
King Digbardhan Sen and his minister Kanak Singh Baniya had already sent their families to safer grounds before the encirclement of their fortress. The Gorkhalis launched an attack on 21 August 1762. The battle lasted for eight hours. King Digbardhan and Kanak Singh escaped to Hariharpurgadhi. Makawanpur was thus annexed by the Gorkhali forces.<ref name="nepalarmy"/>

After occupying the Makawanpurgadhi fort, the Gorkhali forces started planning for an attack on Hariharpurgadhi, a strategic fort on a mountain ridge of the [[Lower Himalayan Range|Mahabharat range]] south of Kathmandu. It controlled the route to the Kathmandu valley. At the dusk of 4 October 1762, the Gorkhalis launched an attack. The soldiers at Hariharpurgadhi fought valiantly against the Gorkhali forces, but were ultimately forced to vacate the ''Gadhi'' (fort) after mid-night. About 500 soldiers of Hariharpur died in the battle.<ref name="nepalarmy"/> [[Mir Qasim]], the [[Nawabs of Bengal and Murshidabad|Nawab of Bengal]] extended his help to kings of Kathmandu valley with his forces to attack the Gorkhali forces.

===Tibetan conflict===
{{See|Sino-Nepalese War}}
After the death of Prithvi Narayan Shah, the Shah dynasty began to expand their kingdom into what is present day [[North India]]. Between 1788 and 1791, Nepal invaded Tibet and robbed [[Tashi Lhunpo Monastery]] of [[Shigatse]]. Tibet sought Chinese help and the [[Qianlong Emperor]] of the Chinese [[Qing dynasty|Qing Dynasty]] appointed [[Fuk'anggan]] commander-in-chief of the Tibetan campaign. Heavy damages were inflicted on both sides. The Nepali forces retreated step by step back to Nuwakot to stretch Sino-Tibetan forces uncomfortably. Chinese launched uphill attack during the daylight and failed to succeed due to strong counterattack with [[Kukri|khukuri]] at Nuwakot.<ref name="nepalarmythree"/> The Chinese army suffered a major setback when they tried to cross a monsoon-flooded Betrawati, close to the Gorkhali palace in Nuwakot.<ref>Stiller, L.F., "The Rise of the House of Gorkha."

[[Damodar Pande]] was appointed as one of the four Kajis by [[Rana Bahadur Shah|King Rana Bahadur Shah]] after removal of ''Chautariya'' Bahadur Shah in 1794.{{sfn|Pradhan|2012|p=12}} Pande was the most influential and dominant amongst the court factions inspite of the post of ''Mulkaji'' being held by [[Kirtiman Singh Basnyat]].{{sfn|Pradhan|2012|p=12}} Pandes were the most dominant noble family. Later due to continuous irrational behaviour of King Rana Bahadur Shah, situation of civil war arose where Damodar was the main opposition to the King.{{sfn|Acharya|2012|pp=28-32}} He was forced to flee to the British-controlled city of [[Varanasi]] in May 1800 after the military parted with influential ''Kaji'' Damodar Pande.{{sfn|Pradhan|2012|p=13}}{{sfn|Acharya|2012|pp=28–32}} After [[Raj Rajeshwari Devi|Queen Rajrajeshwari]] finally managed to assume the regency on 17 December 1802,{{sfn|Pradhan|2012|p=14}}{{sfn|Acharya|2012|pp=36–37}} later in February she appointed Damodar Pande as the ''Mulkaji''.{{sfn|Acharya|2012|p=43}}

After Rana Bahadur's reinstatement to power, he ordered Damodar Pande, along with his two eldest sons, who were completely innocent, to be executed on 13 March 1804; similarly some members of his faction were tortured and executed without any due trial, while many others managed to escape to India. Among those who managed to escape to India were Damodar Pande's sons [[Karbir Pande]] and [[Rana Jang Pande]].{{sfn|Acharya|2012|p=54}}{{sfn|Acharya|2012|p=54}}{{sfn|Nepal|2007|p=57}} After Damodar Pande's execution, [[Ranajit Pande]] who was his paternal cousin, was appointed ''Mulkaji'' along with Bhimsen Thapa as second ''Kaji'', Sher Bahadur Shah as ''Mul Chautariya'' and [[Ranganath Paudel]] as ''Raj Guru'' (Royal Preceptor).{{sfn|Nepal|2007|p=58}}{{sfn|Acharya|2012|p=55}}

===Anglo-Gurkha War===
{{Main|Anglo-Nepalese War}}
[[File:Lost territories of Nepal after Treaty of Sugauli.jpg|thumb|Territories lost by Nepal after the Treaty of Sugauli|alt=]]
Rivalry between Nepal and the [[East India Company]]—over the princely states bordering Nepal and India—eventually led to the [[Anglo-Nepalese War]] (1814–16). The [[Treaty of Sugauli]] was signed in 1816, ceding large parts of the Nepali territories of the Terai and [[Kingdom of Sikkim|Sikkim]], which accounted to nearly one third of the country, to the British in exchange for Nepalese [[Autonomous entity|autonomy]]. As the territories were not restored to Nepal by the British when freedom was granted to the people of [[British Raj|British India]], most of these lands later became a part of the [[India|Republic of India]]. Sikkim remained independent, until annexed into India in 1975, when it become [[Sikkim|the 22nd state of the Republic of India]]. However, in 1860 the British returned the authority over some of Nepal's land in the Terai back to Nepal (known as ''[[Naya Muluk]]'', new country) as an act of gratitude for supporting Britain during various Indian uprisings, such as the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857|Sepoy mutiny]].

===Rana Regime===
{{Main|Rana dynasty}}
[[File:Chandra_Shamsher_and_sons.jpg|thumb|Maharaja of Kaski and Lamjung and [[Prime Minister of Nepal]] [[Chandra Shamsher Jang Bahadur Rana]] and his 8 sons who were one of the most powerful factions of Ranas of Nepal]]
Factionalism among the royal family led to a period of instability after the war. In 1846, [[Rajya Lakshmi Devi|Queen Rajya Lakshmi Devi]] plotted to overthrow [[Jung Bahadur Rana|Jang Bahadur Rana]], a fast-rising military leader who was presenting a threat to her power. The plot was uncovered and the queen had several hundred princes and chieftains executed after an armed clash between military personnel and administrators loyal to the queen. This came to be known as the [[Kot Massacre]]. However, Jung Bahadur emerged victorious eventually and founded the [[Rana dynasty]]; the monarch was made a titular figure, and the post of Prime Minister was made powerful and hereditary, held by the Ranas.

===Third Nepalese Tibet War ===
{{main|Nepalese-Tibetan War}}
[[Jung Bahadur Rana]] sent forces under his brothers [[Bam Bahadur Kunwar]] and [[Dhir Shamsher Rana]] to attack Tibet again to achieve complete victory. His forces succeeded on defeating Tibetan forces on two sides. The Tibetan team arrived on January 1856 to sign a treaty. After a month, the [[Treaty of Thapathali]] was signed which was more favourable to Nepal.<ref name="nepalarmythree"/>

=== Nepal and the British ===
The Rana regime, a tightly centralized [[autocracy]], pursued a policy of isolating Nepal from external influences. This policy helped Nepal maintain its national independence during the [[British Empire|British colonial era]], but it also impeded the country's economic development and modernisation. The Ranas were staunchly pro-British and assisted the British during the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]] and later in both [[World war|World Wars]]. At the same time, despite Chinese claims, the British supported Nepalese independence at the beginning of the twentieth century.<ref>{{cite journal|author = Matteo Miele|title = British Diplomatic Views on Nepal and the Final Stage of the Ch'ing Empire (1910–1911)|journal= Prague Papers on the History of International Relations|date = October 2017|issue=1|url = https://sites.ff.cuni.cz/praguepapers/wp-content/uploads/sites/16/2017/09/Matteo_Miele_90-101.pdf|pages = 90–101|access-date = 10 October 2017}}</ref>

In December 1923, Britain and Nepal formally signed a [[Nepal–Britain Treaty of 1923|treaty of perpetual peace and friendship]] superseding the Sugauli Treaty of 1816 and upgrading the British resident in Kathmandu to an envoy. Slavery was abolished in Nepal in 1924.<ref>Tucci, Giuseppe. (1952). ''Journey to Mustang, 1952''.

===Democratic reform===
{{Main|Democracy movement in Nepal}}

Popular dissatisfaction against the family rule of the Ranas had started emerging from among the few educated people, who had studied in various Indian schools and colleges, and also from within the Ranas, many of whom were marginalised within the ruling Rana hierarchy. Many of these Nepalese in exile had actively taken part in the Indian Independence struggle and wanted to liberate Nepal as well from the internal autocratic Rana occupation. The political parties such as the ''[[Nepal Praja Parishad|Praja Parishad]]'' and [[Nepali Congress]] were already formed in exile by leaders such as [[B. P. Koirala|B.P. Koirala]], [[Ganesh Man Singh]], [[Subarna Shamsher Rana]], [[Krishna Prasad Bhattarai]], [[Girija Prasad Koirala]] and many other patriotic-minded Nepalis who urged the military and popular political movement in Nepal to overthrow the autocratic Rana Regime. Among the prominent martyrs to die for the cause, executed at the hands of the Ranas, were [[Dharma Bhakta Mathema]], [[Shukraraj Shastri]], [[Gangalal Shrestha]] and [[Dashrath Chand|Dasharath Chand]]. This turmoil culminated in [[Tribhuvan of Nepal|King Tribhuvan]], a direct descendant of Prithvi Narayan Shah, fleeing from his 'palace prison' in 1950, to the newly independent India, touching off an armed revolt against the Rana administration. This eventually ended in the return of the Shah family to power and the appointment of a non-Rana as prime minister. A period of quasi-constitutional rule followed, during which the monarch, assisted by the leaders of fledgling political parties, governed the country. During the 1950s, efforts were made to frame a constitution for Nepal that would establish a representative form of government, based on a British model.

In early 1959, Tribhuvan's son [[Mahendra of Nepal|King Mahendra]] issued a new constitution, and the first democratic elections for a national assembly were held. The Nepali Congress, a moderate socialist group, gained a substantial victory in the election. Its leader, B.P. Koirala, formed a government and served as prime minister. After a period of power wrangling between the king and the elected government, Mahendra dissolved the democratic experiment in 1960.

===King Mahendra's new constitution===
{{main|Panchayat (Nepal)}}
Declaring the contemporary parliament a failure, King Mahendra in 1960 dismissed the Koirala government, declared that a "partyless" [[Panchayat (Nepal)|Panchayat]] system would govern Nepal, and promulgated another new constitution on 16 December 1962.

Subsequently, the Prime Minister, members of parliament and hundreds of democratic activists were arrested. In fact, this trend of arrest of political activists and democratic supporters continued for the entire 30-year period of partyless Panchayat system under King Mahendra and then his son, [[Birendra of Nepal|King Birendra]].

The new constitution established a "partyless" system of panchayats (councils), which King Mahendra considered to be a democratic form of government, closer to Nepalese traditions. As a pyramidal structure, progressing from village assemblies to a [[Rastriya Panchayat]] (National Parliament), the panchayat system constitutionalised the absolute power of the monarchy and kept the King as head of state with sole authority over all governmental institutions, including the cabinet (council of ministers) and the parliament. One-state-one-language became the national policy, and all other languages suffered at the cost of the official language, [[Nepali language|Nepali]], which was the king's language.

King Mahendra was succeeded by his 27-year-old son, King Birendra, in 1972. Amid student demonstrations and anti-regime activities in 1979, King Birendra called for a [[1980 Nepalese governmental system referendum|national referendum]] to decide on the nature of Nepal's government: either the continuation of the panchayat system with democratic reforms or the establishment of a multiparty system. The referendum was held in May 1980, and the Panchayat system won a narrow victory. The king carried out the promised reforms, including selection of the prime minister by the Rastriya Panchayat.

==End of Panchayat system==
There was resentment against the authoritarian regime and the curbs on the freedom of the political parties. There was widespread feeling of the palace being non-representative of the masses, especially when the [[Marich Man Singh Shrestha|Marich Man Singh]] government faced political scandals on charges of misappropriation of funds allotted for the victims of the [[1988 Nepal earthquake|earthquake in August 1998]] or when it reshuffled the cabinet instead of investigating the deaths of the people in a stampede in the national sports complex in a hailstorm. Also the souring of the [[India–Nepal relations|India-Nepal trade relations]] affected the popularity of the Singh government.

In April 1987, Nepal had introduced the work permit for Indian workers in three of its districts, and in early 1989, Nepal provided 40% duty concession to Chinese goods and later withdrew duty concessions from Indian goods in such a manner that the Chinese goods became cheaper than the Indian goods. This led to the souring of relations which were already strained over the purchase of Chinese arms by Nepal in 1988. India refused to renew two separate Treaties of Trade and Transit and insisted on a single treaty dealing with the two issues, which was not acceptable to Nepal. A deadlock ensued and the Treaties of Trade and Transit expired on 23 March 1989. The brunt of the closure of the trade and transit points was mainly faced by the lower classes in Nepal due to the restricted supply of consumer goods and petroleum products such as petrol, aviation fuel and kerosene. The industries suffered because of their dependence on India for resources, trade and transit. The Government of Nepal tried to deal with the situation by depending on foreign aid from the US, UK, Australia and China. However, the government's strategy to manage the crisis could not satisfy those people who desired negotiations with India rather than dependence on foreign aid as a solution.{{Citation needed|date=August 2020}}

Taking advantage of the uneasiness amongst some people against the government and the strained India-Nepal relations, the Nepali Congress (NC) and the left-wing parties blamed the government for perpetuating the crisis and not taking any serious measures to solve it. In December 1989, the NC tried to utilize B.P. Koirala's anniversary by launching a people's awareness program. The left-wing alliance known as the United Left Front (ULF) extended its support to the NC in its campaign for a party system. On 18–19 January 1990, the NC held a conference in which leaders from various countries and members of the foreign Press were invited. Leaders from India attended the conference; Germany, Japan, Spain, Finland supported the movement; and the Embassies of the US and West Germany were present on the occasion. Inspired by the international support and the democratic movements occurring throughout the world after the disintegration of the Soviet Union in 1989, the NC and the ULF launched a mass movement on 18 February to end the Panchayat regime, and the installation of an interim government represented by various parties and people.{{Citation needed|date=August 2020}}

On 6 April the Marich Man Singh government was dismissed and Lokendra Bahadur Chand became the Prime Minister on the same day. However, the agitating mob was not satisfied with the change of government as they were not against the Singh government per se but against the party-less system. On 16 April the Chand government was also dismissed and a Royal Proclamation was issued the next day which dissolved the National Panchayat, the Panchayat policy and the evaluation committee and the class organizations. Instead, the proclamation declared "functioning of the political parties" and maintained that "all political parties will always keep the national interest uppermost in organizing themselves according to their political ideology."''{{Citation needed|date=August 2020}}''

During this protest many civilians were killed: after the end of the Panchayat rule they were seen as 'undeclared martyrs'. One of those martyrs is Ram Chandra Hamal, member of the Nepali Congress and killed during his imprisonment.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/nepal/60.htm|title=Nepal - The Panchayat System|website=countrystudies.us|access-date=6 August 2017}}</ref>

==1990 People's Movement==
{{Main|1990 Nepalese revolution}}
People in rural areas had expected that their interests would be better represented after the adoption of parliamentary democracy in 1990. The [[Nepali Congress]] with support of "Alliance of leftist parties" decided to launch a decisive agitational movement, [[1990 Nepalese revolution|Jana Andolan]], which forced the monarchy to accept constitutional reforms and to establish a multiparty parliament. In May 1991, Nepal held its first parliamentary elections in nearly 50 years. The Nepali Congress won 110 of the 205 seats and formed the first elected government in 32 years.

===Civil strife===
In 1992, in a situation of economic crisis and chaos, with spiralling prices as a result of implementation of changes in policy of the new Congress government, the radical left stepped up their political agitation. A Joint People's Agitation Committee was set up by the various groups.<ref>The organisers of the Committee were the [[Samyukta Janamorcha Nepal]], the [[Communist Party of Nepal (Unity Centre)]], [[Communist Party of Nepal (Masal)]], the [[Nepal Communist League]] and the [[Communist Party of Nepal (Marxist-Leninist-Maoist)]].</ref> A [[hartal|general strike]] was called for 6 April.

Violent incidents began to occur on the evening before of the strike. The Joint People's Agitation Committee had called for a 30-minute 'lights out' in the capital, and violence erupted outside [[Bir Hospital]] when activists tried to enforce the 'lights out'. At dawn on 6 April, clashes between strike activists and police, outside a police station in Pulchok (Patan), left two activists dead.

Later in the day, a mass rally of the Agitation Committee at [[Tundikhel]] in the capital Kathmandu was attacked by police forces. As a result, riots broke out and the [[Nepal Telecom]]munications building was set on fire; police opened fire at the crowd, killing several persons. The Human Rights Organisation of Nepal estimated that 14 persons, including several onlookers, had been killed in police firing.<ref>Hoftun, Martin, William Raeper and John Whelpton. People, politics and ideology: Democracy and Social Change in Nepal. Kathmandu: Mandala Book Point, 1999. p. 189</ref>

When promised land reforms failed to appear, people in some districts started to organize to enact their own land reform and to gain some power over their lives in the face of usurious landlords. However, this movement was repressed by the Nepali government, in Operation Romeo and Operation Kilo Sera II, which took the lives of many of the leading activists of the struggle. As a result, many witnesses to this repression became radicalised.

===Nepalese Civil War===
{{Main|Nepalese Civil War}}
In February 1996, one of the [[Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist Centre)|Maoist]] parties started a bid to replace the parliamentary monarchy with a people's new democratic republic, through a Maoist revolutionary strategy known as the [[people's war]], which led to the [[Nepalese Civil War]]. Led by [[Baburam Bhattarai|Dr. Baburam Bhattarai]] and [[Pushpa Kamal Dahal]] (better known by his ''[[nom de guerre]]'' "Prachanda"), the insurgency began in five districts in Nepal: [[Rolpa]], [[Rukum]], [[Jajarkot District|Jajarkot]], [[Gorkha District|Gorkha]], and [[Sindhuli]]. The Maoists declared the existence of a provisional "people's government" at the district level in several locations.

===Palace massacre===
{{Main|Nepalese royal massacre}}
[[File:Narayanhiti Palace Museum.jpg|thumb|400px|The Narayanhiti Palace where the royal massacre occurred]]
On 1 June 2001, Crown Prince [[Dipendra of Nepal|Dipendra]] allegedly went on a [[Nepalese royal massacre|shooting-spree]], assassinating 9 members of the royal family, including [[Birendra of Nepal|King Birendra]] and [[Queen Aishwarya of Nepal|Queen Aishwarya]], before shooting himself. Due to his survival he temporarily became king before dying of his wounds, after which [[Gyanendra of Nepal|Prince Gyanendra]] (Birendra's brother) inherited the throne, according to tradition. The massacre shattered the aura of mythology that still surrounded the Royal Family, exposing their far too human intrigues.

Meanwhile, the Maoist rebellion escalated, and in October 2002 the king temporarily deposed the government and took complete control of it.<ref>{{citation | editor = Mahendra Lawoti and Anup K. Pahari |title =  The Maoist Insurgency in Nepal | year = 2012 | publisher = Routledge | isbn = 9780415777179}}</ref> A week later he reappointed another government, but the country was still very unstable because of the civil war with the Maoists, the various clamouring political factions, the king's attempts to take more control of the government, and worries about the competence of Gyanendra's son and heir, [[Paras Shah|Prince Paras]].

===Suspension of responsible government===
In the face of unstable governments and a Maoist siege on the Kathmandu Valley in August 2004, popular support for the monarchy began to wane. On 1 February 2005, Gyanendra dismissed the entire government and took to exercising his executive powers without ministerial advice, declaring a "[[state of emergency]]" to quash the Maoist movement. Politicians were placed under [[house arrest]], phone and internet lines were cut, and freedom of the press was severely curtailed.

===2006 democracy movement===
{{Main|2006 Nepalese revolution}}

The king's new regime made little progress in his stated aim of suppressing the insurgents. The [[European Union]] described the municipal elections of February 2006 as "a backward step for democracy", as the major parties [[election boycott|boycotted the election]] and the army forced some candidates to run for office.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/comment/story/0,,1699935,00.html The Guardian]</ref> In April 2006 [[2006 Nepalese revolution|strikes and street protests in Kathmandu]] forced the king to reinstate the parliament. A seven-party coalition resumed control of the government and stripped the king of most of his powers. As of 15 January 2007, a [[Unicameralism|unicameral legislature]] under an interim constitution governed Nepal.

===Abolition of the monarchy===
The [[1st Nepalese Constituent Assembly|Constituent Assembly]] came to fruition on 24 December 2007 when it was announced that the monarchy would be abolished in 2008 after the [[2008 Nepalese Constituent Assembly election|Constituent Assembly election]]s;<ref name=abolish>{{cite news| title =Nepalese monarchy to be abolished| publisher =BBC| date =24 December 2007| url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/7158670.stm| access-date =25 December 2007}}</ref> and on 28 May 2008, Nepal was declared a ''Federal Democratic Republic''.

==Geography==
{{Main|Geography of Nepal|Geology of Nepal}}
[[Image:Nepal topo en.jpg|thumb|Topographic map of Nepal]]
[[Image:KaliGandaki.jpg|thumb|The arid and barren Himalayan landscape]]

The Kingdom of Nepal was of roughly trapezoidal shape, 800&nbsp;kilometres (500&nbsp;[[Mile|mi]]) long and 200&nbsp;kilometres (125&nbsp;mi) wide, with an area of 147,181&nbsp;[[square kilometre]]s (56,827&nbsp;[[Square mile|sq&nbsp;mi]]). Nepal was commonly divided into three physiographic areas: the Mountain, [[Hill Region|Hill]], and [[Terai Region]]s. These ecological belts run east-west and are bisected by Nepal's major river systems. The kingdom was roughly the same size as the [[U.S. state]] of [[Arkansas]] or the country of [[England]].

The Madhesi Plains bordering India are part of the northern rim of the [[Indo-Gangetic plains]]. They were formed and are fed by three major rivers: the [[Koshi River|Koshi]], the [[Gandaki River|Narayani]] (Gandak River), and the [[Ghaghara|Karnali]]. This region has a hot, humid climate.

The Hill Region (''Pahad'') abuts the mountains and varies from 1,000 to 4,000 metres (3,300&ndash;13,125&nbsp;[[Foot (unit of length)|ft]]) in altitude. Two low mountain ranges, the [[Mahabharat Lekh]] and [[Siwalik Hills|Shiwalik Range]] (also called the Churia Range) dominate the region. The hilly belt includes the Kathmandu Valley, the country's most fertile and urbanised area. Unlike the valleys Called Inner Tarai (Bhitri Tarai Uptyaka) elevations above 2,500 metres (8,200&nbsp;ft) are sparsely populated.

The Mountain Region contains the highest region in the world. The world's highest mountain, [[Mount Everest]] (''Sagarmatha'' in Nepali) at 8,850 metres (29,035&nbsp;ft) is located on the border with [[China]]. Eight more of the world's [[Eight-thousander|ten highest mountains]] are located in Nepal: [[Lhotse]], [[Makalu]], [[Cho Oyu]], [[Kanchenjunga]], [[Dhaulagiri]], [[Annapurna]] and [[Manaslu]]. Deforestation is a major problem in all regions, with resulting erosion and degradation of ecosystems.

Nepal has five climatic zones, broadly corresponding to altitude. The [[tropical]] and subtropical zones lie below 1,200 metres (3,940&nbsp;ft), the [[temperate]] zone 1,200 to 2,400 metres (3,900&ndash;7,875&nbsp;ft), the cold zone 2,400 to 3,600 metres (7,875&ndash;11,800&nbsp;ft), the subarctic zone 3,600 to 4,400 metres (11,800&ndash;14,400&nbsp;ft), and the Arctic zone above 4,400 metres (14,400&nbsp;ft). Nepal experiences five seasons: summer, [[monsoon]], autumn, winter and spring. The Himalaya blocks cold winds from [[Central Asia]] in winter, and forms the northern limit of the monsoon wind patterns.

Although Nepal shares no boundary with [[Bangladesh]], the two countries are separated by a narrow strip of land about 21 kilometre (13&nbsp;mi) wide, called the [[Siliguri Corridor|Chicken's Neck]]. Efforts are underway to make this area a free-trade zone.

Situated in the Great Himalayan Range in northern part of Nepal, [[Mount Everest]] has the highest [[altitude]] of any mountain in the world. Technically, the south-east ridge on the Nepali side of the mountain is easier to climb, so most climbers travel to Everest through Nepal. The [[Annapurna]] mountain range also lies in Nepal.

==Zones, districts, and regions==
{{Main|Zones of Nepal|Districts of Nepal|Regions of Nepal}}
[[Image:Nepal zones.png|thumb|Nepalese zones]]

Nepal was divided into 14 [[Zones of Nepal|zones]] and 75 [[Districts of Nepal|districts]], grouped into 5 [[Regions of Nepal|development regions]]. Each district was headed by a fixed chief district officer responsible for maintaining law and order and coordinating the work of field agencies of the various government ministries. The 14 zones are:

==Economy==
{{Main|Economy of Nepal}}
[[Image:Nepal landscape 1.jpg|thumb|Terraced farming on the foothills of the Himalayas]]

Agriculture sustains 76% of the population and accounts for about 39% of the [[Gross Domestic Product|GDP]]; services comprise 41%, and industry 22%. Nepal remains isolated from the world's major land, air and sea transport routes though air traffic is frequent. Hilly and mountainous terrain in the northern two-thirds of the country has made the building of roads and other infrastructure difficult and expensive. There were just over 8,500&nbsp;km of paved roads, and one 59&nbsp;km railway line in the south in 2003. There is only one reliable road route from India to the Kathmandu Valley. The only practical seaport of entry for goods bound for Kathmandu is Kolkata in India. Internally, the poor state of development of the road system (22 of 75 administrative districts lack road links) makes volume distribution unrealistic.

Aviation is in a better state, with 48 airports, ten of them with paved runways. There is less than one telephone per 19 people; landline telephone services are not adequate nationwide but concentrated in cities and district headquarters; mobile telephony is in a reasonable state in most parts of the country with increased accessibility and affordability. There were around 175,000 Internet connections in 2005, but after the imposition of the "state of emergency", intermittent losses of service were reported. Uninterrupted Internet connections have resumed after the brief period of confusion as Nepal's second major people's revolution took place to overthrow the King's absolute power.<ref name="CIA_World_Factbook">{{cite web |title=Nepal |work=[[CIA World Factbook]] |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/np.html |access-date=23 September 2005}}</ref>

The country receives foreign aid from [[India]], [[Japan]], the [[United Kingdom]], the [[United States]], the [[European Union]], [[PRC|China]], [[Switzerland]], and [[Scandinavia]]n countries. The government's budget is about US$1.153 billion, with expenditures of $1.789bn (FY05/06). The [[inflation]] rate has dropped to 2.9% after a period of higher inflation during the 1990s. The [[Nepali Rupee]] has been tied to the [[Indian Rupee]] at an exchange rate of 1.6 for many years. Since the loosening of exchange rate controls in the early 1990s, the black market for foreign exchange has all but disappeared. A long-standing economic agreement underpins a close relationship with India.

The [[distribution of wealth]] among the Nepali is consistent with that in many developed and developing countries: the highest 10% of households control 39.1% of the national wealth and the lowest 10% control only 2.6%.

Nepal's workforce of about 10 million suffers from a severe shortage of skilled labour. Agriculture employs 81% of the workforce, services 16% and manufacturing/craft-based industry 3%. Agricultural produce—mostly grown in the Terai region bordering India—includes rice, corn, wheat, sugarcane, root crops, milk, and water buffalo meat. Industry mainly involves the processing of agricultural produce, including [[jute]], sugarcane, tobacco, and grain. The spectacular landscape and deep, exotic culture of Nepal represents considerable potential for tourism, but growth in this export industry has been stifled by recent political events. The [[unemployment rate|rate of unemployment and underemployment]] approaches half of the working-age population. Thus many Nepali citizens move to India in search of work, the Gulf countries and Malaysia being new sources of work. Poverty is acute.<ref name="Sexual_Exploitation_Factbook">{{cite web|title=Nepal |work=Factbook on Global Sexual Exploitation |url=http://www.uri.edu/artsci/wms/hughes/nepal.htm |access-date=23 September 2005 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051230080519/http://www.uri.edu/artsci/wms/hughes/nepal.htm |archive-date=30 December 2005 }}</ref> Nepal receives US$50 million a year through the [[Gurkha]] soldiers who serve in the [[Indian Army|Indian]] and [[British Army|British]] armies and are highly esteemed for their skill and bravery. The total remittance value is worth around US$1 billion, including money sent from Persian Gulf and Malaysia, who combined employ around 700,000 Nepali citizens.

Nepal's GDP for the year 2005 is estimated at just over US$39 billion (adjusted to [[Purchasing Power Parity]]), making it the 83rd-largest economy in the world. Per-capita income is less than US$300. Nepal's exports of mainly carpets, clothing, leather goods, [[jute]] goods and grain total $822 million. Import commodities of mainly gold, machinery and equipment, petroleum products and fertilizer total US$2 bn. India (53.7%), the US (17.4%), and [[Germany]] (7.1%) are its main export partners. Nepal's import partners include India (47.5%), the [[United Arab Emirates]] (11.2%), China (10.7%), [[Saudi Arabia]] (4.9%), and [[Singapore]] (4%).<ref>CIA World Factbook</ref>

==Government and politics==
{{Main|Politics of Nepal}}

Until 1990, Nepal was an [[absolute monarchy]] running under the executive control of the king. Faced with a people's movement against the absolute monarchy, King Birendra, in 1990, agreed to large-scale political reforms by creating a [[parliamentary monarchy]] with the king as the [[head of state]] and a prime minister as the [[head of the government]].

Nepal's legislature was [[bicameral]] consisting of a [[Nepal House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] and a [[National Council of Nepal|National Council]]. The House of Representatives consists of 205 members directly elected by the people. The National Council had sixty members, ten nominated by the king, thirty-five elected by the House of Representatives and the remaining fifteen elected by an electoral college made up of chairs of villages and towns. The legislature had a five-year term, but was dissolvable by the king before its term could end. All Nepali citizens 18 years and older became eligible to vote.

The executive comprised the King and the [[Council of Ministers]] (the [[Cabinet (government)|Cabinet]]). The leader of the coalition or party securing the maximum seats in an election was appointed as the Prime Minister. The Cabinet was appointed by the king on the recommendation of the Prime Minister. Governments in Nepal have tended to be highly unstable; no government has survived for more than two years since 1991, either through internal collapse or parliamentary dissolution by the monarch on the recommendation of prime minister according to the constitution.

The movement in April 2006 brought about a change in the nation. The autocratic King was forced to give up power. The dissolved House of Representatives was restored. The House of Representatives formed a government which had successful peace talks with the Maoist Rebels. An interim constitution was promulgated and an interim House of Representatives was formed with Maoist members. The number of seats were also increased to 330. The peace process in Nepal made a giant leap in April 2007, when the [[List of communist parties in Nepal|Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist)]] joined the interim government of Nepal. The peace process seems to be in jeopardy after Maoists decided to leave coalition government on 18 September 2007, demanding the declaration of a republic before the scheduled constituent assembly.

The [[Nepalese Police Force]] is the civilian police and the [[Armed Police Force Nepal]]<ref>[http://www.apf.gov.np/introduction/introduction.php Official Website of Armed Police Force Nepal] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070710190154/http://www.apf.gov.np/introduction/introduction.php |date=10 July 2007 }}</ref> is the paramilitary force. Service is voluntary and the minimum age for enlistment is 18 years. Nepal spends $99.2 million (2004) on its military—1.5% of its GDP. Most of the equipment and arms are supplied by [[India]].{{ref|arms}}

Nepal has close ties with both of its neighbours, India and China. In accordance with a long-standing treaty, Indian and Nepalese citizens may travel to each other's countries without a [[passport]] or [[visa (document)|visa]]. Nepalese citizens may work in India without legal restriction. Although Nepal and India typically have close ties, from time to time Nepal becomes caught up in the problematic Sino-Indian relationship. India considers Nepal as part of its realm of influence, and views Chinese aid with concern. Some Indians consider Nepal to be part of a greater pan-Indian state, an attitude that has caused Nepalese antagonism towards India. In 2005, after King Gyanendra took over, Nepalese relations with India, the US, and the UK worsened. These three foreign countries were vociferous opponents to the crackdown on civil liberties in Nepal.

The median age is 20.07 (19.91 for males and 20.24 for females). There are 1,060 males for every 1,000 females. Life expectancy is 59.8 years (60.9 for males and 59.5 for females). Total [[Literacy|literacy rate]] is 53.74% (68.51% for males and 42.49% for females).

Groups are the [[Brahman-Hill]] 12.5%, [[Magar people|Magar]] 7%, [[Tharu people|Tharu]] 6.6%, [[Tamang]] 5.5%, [[Newar]] 5.4%, [[Kami (caste)|Kami]] 3.9%, [[Yadav]] 3.9%, other 32.7%, Nepali White 2.8%.

Differences between Hindus and Buddhists have been in general very subtle and academic in nature due to the intermingling of Hindu and Buddhist beliefs. Both share common temples and worship common deities and many of Nepal's Hindus could also be regarded as Buddhists and [[vice versa]].<ref>Library of Congress, Religion and Society</ref> [[Gurkhas]] are from Nepal. Buddhism was relatively more common among the Newar. Among the other natives of Nepal, those most influenced by Hinduism were the [[Magar people|Magar]], [[Sunwar]], [[Limbu people|Limbu]] and [[Rai people|Rai]]. Hindu influence is less prominent among the [[Gurung]], [[Bhutia]], and [[Thakali people|Thakali]] groups, who employ Buddhist monks for their religious ceremonies.<ref name="CIA_World_Factbook"/><ref name="Library_of_Congress">{{cite web|title=A Country Study: Nepal|work=Federal Research Division, [[Library of Congress]]|url=http://memory.loc.gov/frd/cs/nptoc.html| access-date =23 September 2005}}</ref>

The northern mountains are sparsely populated. A majority of the population live in the central highland despite the migration of a significant section of the population to the fertile Terai belt in recent years. Kathmandu, with a population of around 800,000 (Metropolitan area: 1,5 million) is the largest city in the country.

==Culture==
{{Main|Culture of Nepal}}

Nepalese culture is diverse and it reflects people of different ethnic origins. A typical Nepalese meal is ''dal-bhat'', a kind of a lentil soup served with rice and vegetables. However, the Newar community has its own unique cuisine. It consists of non-vegetarian and vegetarian items as well as alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages. Mustard oil and a host of spices, such as cumin, sesame seeds, turmeric, garlic, ginger, methi (fenugreek), bay leaves, cloves, cinnamon, pepper, chili, mustard seeds, vinegar, etc. are used in cooking. The cuisine served in the festivals is considered as the best diet cuisine.

Folklore is an integral part of Nepalese society. Traditional stories are rooted in the reality of day-to-day life—tales of love, affection, battles, and demons and ghosts; they reflect and explain local lifestyles, cultures and belief systems. Many Nepalese folktales are enacted in dance and music. The Newar community is very rich in cultural diversity. Most of the festivals observed in the Kthmandu valley are in the Newar community. The Newars are also well known for their music and dance. The Newar Music consists mainly of percussion instruments. Wind instruments such as flutes and similar instruments are also used. String instruments are very rare. There are songs pertaining to particular seasons and festivals. Paahan chare music is most probably the fastest played music whereas the Dapa the slowest. The dhimay music are the loudest ones. There are certain musical instruments such as Dhimay and Bhusya which are played as instrumental only and are not accompanied with songs. The Newar Dance can be broadly classified as masked dance and dance without the use of masks. The most representative of Newari dance is Lakhey dance. Almost all the settlements of Newar have Lakhey dance at least once a year. Almost all of these Lakhey dances are held in the Goonlaa month. So, they are called Goonlaa Lakhey. However, the most famous Lakhey dance is the Majipa Lakhey dance. It is performed by the Ranjitkars of Kathmandu. The dance takes place for a week during the week containing the full moon of Yenlaa month. The Lakhey are considered as the saviors of children. Likewise, in hills people enjoy their own kind of music, playing saarangi (string instrument), madal and flute. They also have many popular folk songs like ''lok geet'' and ''lok dohari''.

The Nepali year begins in mid-April and is divided into 12 months. Saturday is the official weekly holiday. Main holidays include the National Day (birthday of the king) 28 December, Prithvi Jayanti, (11 January), and Martyr's Day (18 February) and a mix of Hindu and Buddhist festivals such as [[dashai]] in autumn, and ''[[tihar (festival)|tihar]]'' late autumn. During tihar, the Newar community celebrates its New Year as per local calendar (Nepal Sambat).

Most houses in rural Nepal are made up of a tight bamboo framework with mud and cow-dung walls. These dwellings remain cool in summers and retain warmth in winters. Dwellings in higher latitudes are mostly timber based.
