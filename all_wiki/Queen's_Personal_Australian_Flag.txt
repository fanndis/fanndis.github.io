The '''Queen's Personal Australian Flag''' is the personal flag of [[Elizabeth II of Australia|Queen Elizabeth II]] in her role as [[Monarchy in Australia|Queen of Australia]]. The flag was approved for use in 1962. It is only used by the Queen when she is in [[Australia]], or attending an event abroad in her role as head of state of Australia. The Queen's representative, the [[Governor-General of Australia]] has a [[Flag of the Governor-General of Australia|separate flag]].

The flag consists of a banner of the [[Coat of Arms of Australia|coat of arms of Australia]], defaced with a gold seven-pointed federation [[Commonwealth Star|star]] with a blue disc containing the letter E below a crown, surrounded by a garland of golden roses.

Each of the six sections of the flag represents the [[heraldic badge]] of the [[States and territories of Australia|Australian states]], and the whole is surrounded by an [[Ermine (heraldry)|ermine]] border representing the federation of the states:<ref>[http://www.anbg.gov.au/oz/arms.html Government of Australia: Department of the Environment and Water Resources]</ref>

:*The '''Upper Left''' represents [[New South Wales]] and bears a red [[St George's Cross]], upon which is a gold lion in the centre and a gold star on each arm.
:*The '''Upper Middle''' represents [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] and contains a Crown and five white stars on a blue field.
:*The '''Upper Right''' represents [[Queensland]] and consists of a blue [[Maltese cross]], bearing a Crown, on a white field.
:*The '''Lower Left''' represents [[South Australia]] and includes a [[piping shrike]] on a gold field.
:*The '''Lower Middle''' represents [[Western Australia]] and consists of a [[black swan]] on a gold field.
:*The '''Lower Right''' represents [[Tasmania]] and contains a red lion on a white field.

The gold seven-pointed star (the [[Commonwealth Star]]), represents the [[States and territories of Australia|states]] and the [[States and territories of Australia|territories]]. The blue disc is taken from the [[Personal Flag of Queen Elizabeth II|Queen's Personal Flag]] as used for duties within the [[Commonwealth of Nations]].

The flag is used in two ratios, 1:2 and 22:31. The 1:2 ratio ensures the flag maintains visual integrity with other naval flags, which are 1:2. A 22:31 ratio gives simple dimensions for the flag elements, with a border of 2 units thick, and central squares of dimensions 9Ã—9.

== Coronation Standards ==
During the coronation ceremony of the monarch at Westminster Abbey, the "standards" of various countries are carried by various officials in the procession inside the abbey. These flags are the country's coat of arms as a [[banner of arms]]. For Australia, similar standards based on the current and previous coat of arms were used thrice: at the coronations of [[Coronation of George V and Mary|King George V]], [[Coronation of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth|King George VI]] and [[Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] in 1911, 1937, and 1953, respectively.{{fact|date=August 2015}} The banner of the 1908-1912 coat of arms was used in 1911<ref>{{Cite news|date=1911-05-15|title=CORONATION STANDARDS.|pages=5|work=Northern Star (Lismore, NSW : 1876 - 1954)|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article72278988|access-date=2020-08-18}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Alfred Pearse (c.1854-1933) - Coronation of George V: Standard bearers|url=https://www.rct.uk/collection/923166/coronation-of-george-v-standard-bearers|access-date=2020-08-18|website=www.rct.uk|language=en}}</ref>, with the banner of the current arms used in 1937 and 1953<ref>{{Cite news|date=1953-05-23|title=Australian Standard For Coronation|pages=2|work=Advertiser (Adelaide, SA : 1931 - 1954)|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article48278293|access-date=2020-08-18}}</ref>.
