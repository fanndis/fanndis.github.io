'''Andy Kerr''' (born 17 March 1962) is a Scottish politician who served as [[Cabinet Secretary for Finance|Minister for Finance and Public Services]] from 2001 to 2004 and [[Cabinet Secretary for Health and Sport|Minister for Health and Community Care]] from 2004 to 2007. A member of the [[Scottish Labour|Scottish Labour Party]], he was [[Member of the Scottish Parliament]] (MSP) for the [[East Kilbride (Scottish Parliament constituency)|East Kilbride]] constituency from [[1999 Scottish Parliament election|1999]] to [[2011 Scottish Parliament election|2011]].

==Early years==
Born in [[East Kilbride]], Kerr was educated at [[Claremont High School (East Kilbride)|Claremont High School]] in [[East Kilbride]] and obtained a [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] in [[Social Sciences]] at [[Glasgow Caledonian University]]. Prior to being elected to the [[Scottish Parliament]], he was a senior officer in [[Glasgow City Council]] land services department and served as an adviser in the Leader's office. He was also founder and managing director of ''Achieving'', a quality assurance consultancy.

== Parliamentary career ==
He was convener of the [[Scottish Parliament]]'s Transport and Environment [[Scottish Parliament#Committees|Committee]] and served on the [[Confederation of British Industry]] working group designed to bring [[Member of the Scottish Parliament|Members of the Scottish Parliament]] (MSP) and business closer together as well as being on the cross-party group on ageing and the elderly.

Kerr is considered to be an ally of [[Motherwell and Wishaw (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Motherwell and Wishaw]] MSP [[Jack McConnell]], working with him on his two successive bids for the leadership of Scottish Labour and the position of First Minister.

Kerr was first appointed [[List of Scottish Executive Ministerial Teams|Minister for Finance and Public Services]] in the [[Scottish Executive]] in November 2001 and moved to become Minister for Health and Community Care in October 2004, replacing [[Malcolm Chisolm]]. As Health Minister, Kerr oversaw significant NHS restructuring.

He was also responsible for the Scottish ban on [[smoking ban in public places]] which was introduced on 26 March 2006. In November 2006, he won the [[Scottish Politician of the Year]] award in recognition of his work to bring in the smoking ban.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/north_east/6156548.stm Deportation campaign wins award], ''[[BBC News]]'', 17 November 2006</ref> Kerr retained the health portfolio in McConnell's shadow cabinet upon the [[Scottish National Party]]'s victory at the [[2007 Scottish Parliament election|2007 election]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Scottish Parliament Factsheet - MINISTERS, LAW OFFICERS AND MINISTERIAL PARLIAMENTARY AIDES, BY CABINET: SESSION 2|url=http://www.parliament.scot/ResearchBriefingsAndFactsheets/Ministers_Law_Officers_Ministerial_Parliamentary_Aides_by_Cabinet_Session_2.pdf|last=Public Information Service|first=|date=8 June 2008|website=[[Scottish Parliament]]|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>

Having ruled himself out of contention as a successor for Jack McConnell, Kerr voted for Wendy Alexander to become leader of the Scottish Labour Party. On 17 September 2007 he was appointed Shadow Cabinet Secretary for Public Services and Local Government. With [[Wendy Alexander]]'s resignation as leader of the Labour Party in Scotland, Kerr stood for election as the next leader. However, following the victory of Iain Gray in the leadership election, Kerr was appointed Shadow Cabinet Secretary for Finance and Sustainable Growth.

At the [[2011 Scottish Parliament election]], Kerr was one of many Labour casualties, losing his seat after 12 years to [[Linda Fabiani]] of the SNP.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-13305003|title=Labour 'class of '99' lose to SNP|date=6 May 2011|publisher=BBC}}</ref> Kerr did not stand on the regional list, so therefore did not return as an MSP.

== Personal life ==
Kerr lives in [[Strathaven]] with his wife and three daughters.

On 11 July 2011, it was announced that Andy had been appointed to the vacant CEO position at Scottish Charity Organisation, [[Sense Scotland]].<ref>http://www.sensescotland.org.uk/news/new-ceo-announcement.php{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>
