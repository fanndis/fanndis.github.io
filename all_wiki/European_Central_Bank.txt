[[File:Frankfurt EZB-Neubau.20130909.jpg|upright=1.2|thumb|[[Seat of the European Central Bank]]]]

The '''European Central Bank''' ('''ECB''') is the [[central bank]] of the [[Eurozone]], a [[monetary union]] of 19 [[Member state of the European Union|EU member states]] which employ the [[euro]]. Established by the [[Treaty of Amsterdam]], the ECB is one of the world's [[Big Four (banking)#International use|most important central banks]] and serves as one of seven [[institutions of the European Union]], being enshrined in the [[Treaty on European Union]] (TEU). The bank's capital stock is owned by all 27 central banks of each EU member state.<ref name="capital" /> The current [[President of the European Central Bank|President of the ECB]] is [[Christine Lagarde]]. [[Seat of the European Central Bank|Headquartered]] in [[Frankfurt]], Germany, the bank formerly occupied the [[Eurotower (Frankfurt am Main)|Eurotower]] prior to the construction of its new seat.

The primary objective of the ECB, mandated in Article 2 of the Statute of the ECB,<ref name=ecbst>[http://www.ecb.int/ecb/legal/pdf/en_statute_from_c_11520080509en02010328.pdf Statute of the ECB]</ref> is to maintain [[price stability]] within the [[Eurozone]]. Its basic tasks, set out in Article 3 of the Statute,<ref name=ecbst/> are to set and implement the [[monetary policy]] for the Eurozone, to conduct foreign exchange operations, to take care of the [[foreign reserve]]s of the [[European System of Central Banks]] and operation of the financial market infrastructure under the [[TARGET2]] payments system and the technical platform (currently being developed) for settlement of securities in Europe ([[TARGET2 Securities]]). The ECB has, under Article 16 of its Statute,<ref name=ecbst/> the exclusive right to authorise the issuance of [[euro banknotes]]. Member states can issue [[euro coins]], but the amount must be authorised by the ECB beforehand.

The ECB is governed by European law directly, but its set-up resembles that of a corporation in the sense that the ECB has shareholders and stock capital. Its capital is €11 billion held by the national central banks of the member states as shareholders.<ref name="capital"/> The initial capital allocation key was determined in 1998 on the basis of the states' population and GDP, but the capital key has been adjusted.<ref name="capital"/> Shares in the ECB are not transferable and cannot be used as collateral.

The ECB formally replaced the EMI on 1 June 1998 by virtue of the [[Treaty on European Union]] (TEU, Treaty of Maastricht), however it did not exercise its full powers until the [[introduction of the euro]] on 1 January 1999, signalling the third stage of EMU.<ref name="autogenerated1"/> The bank was the final institution needed for EMU, as outlined by the EMU reports of [[Pierre Werner]] and [[President of the European Commission|President]] [[Jacques Delors]].

There had also been tension over the ECB's [[Executive Board of the European Central Bank|Executive Board]], with the former member  state United Kingdom demanding a seat even though it had not joined the Single Currency.<ref name="ENA EMU3"/> Under pressure from France, three seats were assigned to the largest members, France, Germany, and Italy; Spain also demanded and obtained a seat. Despite such a system of appointment the board asserted its independence early on in resisting calls for interest rates and future candidates to it.<ref name="ENA EMU3"/>

When the ECB was created, it covered a [[Eurozone]] of eleven members. Since then, Greece joined in January 2001, Slovenia in January 2007, Cyprus and Malta in January 2008, Slovakia in January 2009, Estonia in January 2011, Latvia in January 2014 and Lithuania in January 2015, enlarging the bank's scope and the membership of its Governing Council.<ref name="autogenerated2"/>

=== Response to the European debt crisis ===
{{main|European debt crisis}}{{Cleanup reorganize|date=November 2017}}<!-- We need a section here about the ECB's intervention in the early days of the GFC. -->

From late 2009 a handful of mainly southern eurozone member states started being unable to repay their national Euro-denominated [[government debt]] or to finance the bail-out of troubled financial sectors under their national supervision without the assistance of third parties. This so-called ''[[European debt crisis]]'' began after Greece's new elected government stopped masking its true indebtedness and budget deficit and {{Citation needed span|text=openly communicated|date=September 2018|reason=}} the imminent danger of a Greek [[sovereign default]].

Foreseeing a possible sovereign default in the eurozone, the general public, international and European institutions, and the financial community reassessed the economic situation and creditworthiness of some Eurozone member states, in particular Southern countries. Consequently, sovereign bonds yields of several Eurozone countries started to rise sharply. This provoked a self-fulfilling panic on financial markets: the more Greek bonds yields rose, the more likely a default became possible, the more bond yields increased in turn.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSLDE61F0W720100216|title=Peripheral euro zone government bond spreads widen|author=George Matlock|date=16 February 2010|access-date=28 April 2010|agency=Reuters}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/16009099|title=Acropolis now|date=29 April 2010|work=The Economist|access-date=22 June 2011}}</ref><ref name="wsj">{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704041504575045743430262982|title=Global Markets Shudder: Doubts About U.S. Economy and a Debt Crunch in Europe Jolt Hopes for a Recovery|author1=Brian Blackstone|date=5 February 2010|work=The Wall Street Journal|access-date=10 May 2010|author2=Tom Lauricella|author3=Neil Shah}}</ref><ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/06/world/europe/geir-haarde-former-iceland-leader-goes-on-trial-for-role-in-financial-crisis.html "Former Iceland Leader Tried Over Financial Crisis of 2008"], ''The New York Times'', 5 March 2012.

This panic was also aggravated because of the inability of the ECB to react and intervene on sovereign bonds markets for two reasons. First, because the ECB's legal framework normally forbids the purchase of sovereign bonds (Article 123. TFEU),<ref>Bagus, ''The Tragedy of the Euro'', 2010, p.75.</ref> This prevented the ECB from implementing [[quantitative easing]] like the Federal Reserve and the Bank of England did as soon as 2008, which played an important role in stabilizing markets. Secondly, a decision by the ECB made in 2005 introduced a minimum credit rating (BBB-) for all Eurozone sovereign bonds to be eligible as collateral to the ECB's open market operations. This meant that if a private rating agencies were to downgrade a sovereign bond below that threshold, many banks would suddenly become illiquid because they would lose access to ECB refinancing operations. According to former member of the governing council of the ECB [[Athanasios Orphanides]], this change in the ECB's collateral framework "planted the seed" of the euro crisis.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://voxeu.org/article/how-ecb-planted-seeds-euro-area-crisis|title=Monetary policy and fiscal discipline: How the ECB planted the seeds of the euro area crisis|last=Orphanides|first=Athanasios|date=9 March 2018|website=VoxEU.org|access-date=22 September 2018}}</ref>

Faced with those regulatory constraints, the ECB led by Jean-Claude Trichet in 2010 was reluctant to intervene to calm down financial markets. Up until 6 May 2010, Trichet formally denied at several press conferences<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2010/html/is100506.en.html|title=Introductory statement with Q&A|last=Bank|first=European Central|website=European Central Bank|language=en|access-date=3 October 2018}}</ref> the possibility of the ECB to embark into sovereign bonds purchases, even though Greece, Portugal, Spain and Italy faced waves of [[credit rating]] downgrades and increasing interest rate spreads.

==== Securities Market Programme ====
[[File:ECB SMP Bond Purchases.png|thumb|upright=0.9|ECB Securities Markets Programme (SMP) covering bond purchases since May 2010]]
On 10 May 2010, the ECB announced<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pr/date/2010/html/pr100510.en.html|title=ECB decides on measures to address severe tensions in financial markets|last=Bank|first=European Central|website=European Central Bank|language=en|access-date=22 September 2018}}</ref> the launch of a "Securities Market Programme" (SMP) which involved the discretionary purchase of sovereign bonds in secondary markets. Extraordinarily, the decision was taken by the Governing Council during a teleconference call only three days after the ECB's usual meeting of 6 May (when Trichet still denied the possibility of purchasing sovereign bonds). The ECB justified this decision by the necessity to "address severe tensions in financial markets." The decision also coincided with the EU leaders decision of 10 May to establish the European Financial Stabilisation mechanism, which would serve as a crisis fighting fund to safeguard the euro area from future sovereign debt crisis.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://euobserver.com/economic/30048|title=Mixed support for ECB bond purchases|access-date=22 September 2018|language=en}}</ref>

The ECB's bond buying focused primarily on Spanish and Italian debt.<ref>{{cite news |first1=John |last1=McManus |first2=Dan |last2=O'Brien |title=Market rout as Berlin rejects call for more EU action |journal=Irish Times |date=5 August 2011 }}</ref> They were intended to dampen international speculation against those countries, and thus avoid a contagion of the Greek crisis towards other Eurozone countries. The assumption is that speculative activity will decrease over time and the value of the assets increase.

Although SMP did involve an injection of new money into financial markets, all ECB injections were "sterilized" through weekly liquidity absorption. So the operation was neutral for the overall money supply.<ref name="Euro debt working paper" />{{Citation needed|reason=Reference does not mention 'sterilized injections' or 'liquidity absorption'. Add page number, or different source.|date=April 2019}}

When the ECB buys bonds from other creditors such as European banks, the ECB does not disclose the transaction prices. Creditors profit of bargains with bonds sold at prices that exceed market's quotes.

As of 18 June 2012, the ECB in total had spent €212.1bn (equal to 2.2% of the Eurozone GDP) for bond purchases covering outright debt, as part of  the Securities Markets Programme.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.commbank.com.au/corporate/research/publications/economics/economic-issues/international/2012/180612-ECB.pdf|title=The ECB's Securities Market Programme (SMP) – about to restart bond purchases?|work=Global Markets Research – International Economics|publisher=Commonwealth Bank|date=18 June 2012|access-date=21 April 2013}}</ref> Controversially, the ECB made substantial profits out of SMP, which were largely redistributed to Eurozone countries.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.positivemoney.eu/2018/07/ecb-smp-profits-billions-lost-for-greece/|title=How Greece lost billions out of an obscure ECB programme|date=25 July 2018|work=Positive Money Europe|access-date=25 September 2018|language=en-GB}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.guengl.eu/news/article/the-ecb-as-vulture-fund-how-central-banks-speculated-against-greece-and-won|title=The ECB as vulture fund: how central banks speculated against Greece and won big – GUE/NGL – Another Europe is possible|website=guengl.eu|language=en|access-date=25 September 2018}}</ref> In 2013, the [[Eurogroup]] decided to refund those profits to Greece, however the payments were suspended over 2014 until 2017 over the conflict between [[Yanis Varoufakis]] and ministers of the Eurogroup. In 2018, profits refunds were reinstalled by the Eurogroup. However, several NGOs complained that a substantial part of the ECB profits would never be refunded to Greece.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.positivemoney.eu/2018/10/petition-eurogroup-return-ecb-profits-to-greece/|title=Unfair ECB profits should be returned to Greece, 117,000 citizens demand|date=19 October 2018|work=Positive Money Europe|access-date=21 October 2018|language=en-GB}}</ref>

====Reaction to the Irish banking crisis ====
In November 2010, it became clear that Ireland would not be able to afford to bail out its failing banks, and [[Anglo Irish Bank]] in particular which needed around 30 billion euros, a sum the government obviously could not borrow from financial markets when its bond yields were soaring to comparable levels with the Greek bonds. Instead, the government issued a 31bn EUR "promissory note" (an IOU) to Anglo – which it had nationalized. In turn, the bank supplied the promissory note as collateral to the [[Central Bank of Ireland]], so it could access emergency liquidity assistance (ELA). This way, Anglo was able to repay its bondholders. The operation became very controversial, as it basically shifted Anglo's private debts onto the government's balance sheet.

It became clear later that the ECB played a key role in making sure the Irish government did not let Anglo default on its debts, in order to avoid a financial instability risks. On 15 October and 6 November 2010, the ECB President [[Jean-Claude Trichet]] sent two secret letters<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/html/irish-letters.en.html|title=Irish letters|last=Bank|first=European Central|website=European Central Bank|language=en|access-date=3 October 2018}}</ref> to the Irish finance Minister which essentially informed the Irish government of the possible suspension of ELA's credit lines, unless the government requested a financial assistance programme to the [[Eurogroup]] under condition of further reforms and fiscal consolidation. Over 2012 and 2013, the ECB repeatedly insisted that the promissory note should be repaid in full, and refused the Government's proposal to swap the notes with a long-term (and less costly) bond until February 2013.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.thejournal.ie/reuters-report-ecb-promissory-note-bond-770857-Jan2013/|title=Report: ECB rules out long-term bond to replace promissory note|last=Reilly|first=Gavan|work=TheJournal.ie|access-date=3 October 2018|language=en}}</ref> In addition, the ECB insisted that no debt restructuring (or [[bail-in]]) should be applied to the nationalized banks' bondholders, a measure which could have saved Ireland 8 billion euros.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/business/financial-services/chopra-ecb-refusal-to-burn-bondholders-burdened-taxpayers-1.2347861|title=Chopra: ECB refusal to burn bondholders burdened taxpayers|work=The Irish Times|access-date=3 October 2018|language=en-US}}</ref>

In short, fearing a new financial panic, the ECB took extraordinary measures to avoid at all cost debt restructuring in Ireland, which resulted in higher public debt in Ireland.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.thejournal.ie/anglo-promissory-notes-ecb-775366-Feb2013/|title=Everything you need to know about the promissory notes, but were afraid to ask|last=O'Connell|first=Hugh|work=TheJournal.ie|access-date=3 October 2018|language=en}}</ref>

Soon after [[Mario Draghi]] took over the presidency of the ECB, the bank announced on 8 December 2011 a new round of 1% interest loans with a term of three years (36 months) – the '''Long-term Refinancing operations (LTRO)'''.

Thanks to this operation, 523 Banks tapped as much as €489.2 bn (US$640 bn).

====Outright Monetary Transactions====
In July 2012, in the midst of renewed fears about sovereigns in the eurozone, Draghi stated in a panel discussion in London that the ECB "...is ready to do ''whatever it takes'' to preserve the Euro. And believe me, it will be enough."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/key/date/2012/html/sp120726.en.html|title=Verbatim of the remarks made by Mario Draghi|last=Bank|first=European Central|website=European Central Bank|language=en|access-date=25 September 2018}}</ref> This statement led to a steady decline in bond yields for eurozone countries, in particular Spain, Italy and France.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.ft.com/content/93b358ba-c1d4-11e0-bc71-00144feabdc0|title=Itay and Spain respond to ECB treatment|date=8 August 2011|work=Financial Times|access-date=28 December 2019}}</ref> In light of slow political progress on solving the eurozone crisis, Draghi's statement has been seen as a key turning point in the fortunes of the eurozone.

Following up on Draghi's speech, the Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) announced on 2 August 2012, that it "may undertake outright open market operations of a size adequate to reach its objective"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2012/html/is120802.en.html|title=Introductory statement to the press conference (with Q&A)}}</ref> in order to "safeguarding an appropriate monetary policy transmission and the singleness of the monetary policy". The technical framework of these operations was formulated on 6 September 2012 when the ECB announced the launch of the '''[[Outright Monetary Transactions]] programme (OMT)'''.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/07/business/global/european-central-bank-leaves-interest-rates-unchanged-at-0-75-percent.html?pagewanted=all|title=Europe's Central Bank Moves Aggressively to Ease Euro Crisis|last1=Ewing|first1=Jack|date=6 September 2012|work=The New York Times|last2=Erlanger|first2=Steven}}</ref> On the same date, the bank's [[#Bond purchase|Securities Markets Programme]] (SMP) was terminated.

While the duration of the previous SMP was temporary,<ref>European Central Bank [http://www.ecb.int/ecb/legal/pdf/l_12420100520en00080009.pdf Decision of the ECB of 14 May 2010].</ref> OMT has no [[ex-ante]] time or size limit.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ecb.int/press/pressconf/2012/html/is120906.en.html|title=ECB press conference, 6 September 2012|access-date=14 September 2014}}</ref> However, the activation of the purchases remains conditioned to the adherence by the benefitting country to an adjustment programme to the ESM. To date, OMT was never actually implemented by the ECB. However it is considered that its announcement (together with the "whatever it takes" speech) significantly contributed in stabilizing financial markets and ended the sovereign debt crisis.

==== Quantitative easing ====
Although the sovereign debt crisis was almost solved by 2014, the ECB started to face a repeated decline<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://calrev.org/2019/05/04/on-the-causes-of-european-political-instability/|title=On the Causes of European Political Instability|last=Henderson|first=Isaiah M.|date=4 May 2019|website=The California Review|language=en-US|access-date=19 July 2019}}</ref> in the Eurozone inflation rate, indicating that the economy was going towards a deflation. Responding to this threat, the ECB announced on 4 September 2014 the launch of two bond buying purchases programmes: the Covered Bond Purchasing Programme (CBPP3) and Asset-Backed Securities Programme (ABSPP).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2014/html/is140904.en.html|title=Introductory statement to the press conference (with Q&A)|last=European Central Bank|website=European Central Bank|language=en|access-date=25 September 2018}}</ref>

On 22 January 2015, the ECB announced an extension of those programmes within a full-fledge "quantitative easing" programme which also included sovereign bonds, to the tune of 60 billion euros per month up until at least September 2016. The programme was started on 9 March 2015. The program was repeatedly extended to reach about €2,500 billions and is currently expected to last until at least end of 2018.<ref>{{cite news |title=Draghi fends off German critics and keeps stimulus untouched |url=https://www.ft.com/content/efece562-2b30-11e7-bc4b-5528796fe35c |newspaper=Financial Times |date=27 April 2017}}</ref>

On 8 June 2016, the ECB added euro-denominated corporate bonds to its asset purchases portfolio with the launch of the corporate sector purchase programme (CSPP).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ecb.europa.eu/ecb/legal/pdf/celex_32016d0016_en_txt.pdf?0240957ff3a5d0b909a9482628799777|title=DECISION (EU) 2016/948 OF THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK of 1 June 2016 on the implementation of the corporate sector purchase programme (ECB/2016/16)}}</ref> Under this programme, it conducted net purchase of corporate bonds until January 2019 to reach about €177 billion.

=== Response to the COVID-19 crisis ===
In 2020, the ECB formulated a response to the [[COVID-19 recession|COVID-19 crisis]].
This response included:
* the € 1350 billion Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme (PEPP) which aimed to lower borrowing costs and increase lending in the euro area.<ref name="rldt">{{cite news |last1=Lynch |first1=Russell |title=France slams 'dangerous' Italian pleas to cancel Covid debts |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2020/11/27/france-slams-dangerous-italian-pleas-cancel-covid-debts/ |publisher=Telegraph Media Group Limited |date=27 November 2020}}</ref> The PEPP was extended to cover an additional € 500 billion in December 2020.<ref name=rldt/>
* keeping key interest rates at historically low levels

* offering immediate borrowing options at favourable rates for solvent banks to solve temporary funding issues
* being temporarily less strict about the amount of funds, or “capital”, that banks are required to hold as a buffer for difficult times and giving banks more flexibility on supervisory timelines, deadlines and procedures.
* reactivating currency swap lines and enhanced existing swap lines with central banks across the globe<ref>[https://www.ecb.europa.eu/home/search/coronavirus/html/index.en.html Our response to the coronavirus pandemic]</ref>

==Mandate and inflation target==
[[File:Zahlungsmittel.JPG|thumb|[[Euro banknotes]]]]
Unlike many other central banks, the ECB does not have a ''dual mandate'' where it has to pursue two equally important objectives such as price stability and full employment (like the [[Federal Reserve System|US Federal Reserve System]]). The ECB has only one primary objective – price stability – subject to which it may pursue secondary objectives.

=== Primary mandate ===
The primary objective of the European Central Bank, set out in Article 127(1) of the [[Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union]], is to maintain [[price stability]] within the [[Eurozone]].<ref>[[s:Consolidated version of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union/Title VIII: Economic and Monetary Policy#CHAPTER 2: MONETARY POLICY|wikisource consolidation]]</ref> However the EU Teaties do not specify exactly how the ECB should pursue this objective. The European Central Bank has ample discretion over the way it purses its price stability objective, as it can self-decide on the inflation target, and may also influence the way it measures the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP).

The Governing Council in October 1998<ref name="HANSPETER K 2006, page 81">THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK HISTORY, ROLE AND FUNCTIONS BY HANSPETER K. SCHELLER SECOND REVISED EDITION 2006, {{ISBN|92-899-0022-9}} (print) {{ISBN|92-899-0027-X}} (online) page 81 at the pdf online version</ref> defined price stability as inflation of under 2%, “a year-on-year increase in the [[Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices]] (HICP) for the euro area of below 2%” and added that price stability ”was to be maintained over the medium term”.<ref name="ENA Pow">{{cite web |title=Powers and responsibilities of the European Central Bank |publisher=European Central Bank |url=http://www.ecb.int/ecb/orga/tasks/html/index.en.html |access-date=10 March 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-date=16 December 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216083913/http://www.ecb.int/ecb/orga/tasks/html/index.en.html}}</ref> 

In May 2003, following a thorough review of the ECB's monetary policy strategy, the Governing Council clarified that “in the pursuit of price stability, it aims to maintain inflation rates '''<u>below, but close to</u>''', 2% over the medium term”.<ref name="HANSPETER K 2006, page 81" /> 

Since 2016, the European Central Bank's President has further adjusted its communication, by introducing the notion of "symmetry" in its definition of its target,<ref>{{Cite web|last=Draghi|first=Mario|date=2016-06-02|title=Delivering a symmetric mandate with asymmetric tools: monetary policy in a context of low interest rates|url=https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/key/date/2016/html/sp160602.en.html|access-date=2020-11-28|website=European Central Bank|language=en}}</ref> thus making it clear that the ECB should respond both to inflationary pressure to deflationary pressures. As [[Mario Draghi|Draghi]] once said "symmetry meant not only that we would not accept persistently low inflation, but also that there was no cap on inflation at 2%."<ref>{{Cite web|last=Bank|first=European Central|date=2019-06-18|title=Twenty Years of the ECB’s monetary policy|url=https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/key/date/2019/html/ecb.sp190618~ec4cd2443b.en.html|access-date=2020-11-28|website=European Central Bank|language=en}}</ref>

=== Secondary mandate ===
Without prejudice to the objective of price stability, the Treaty (127 TFEU) also provides room for the ECB to pursue other objectives:<blockquote>"Without prejudice to the objective of price stability, the ESCB shall support the general economic policies in the Union with a view to contributing to the achievement of the objectives of the Union as laid down in Article 3 of the Treaty on European Union."<ref>{{cite web|title=ECB: Monetary Policy|url=http://www.ecb.int/ecb/tasks/html/index.en.html|access-date=14 September 2014}}</ref></blockquote>This legal provision is often considered to provide a "secondary mandate" to the ECB, and offers ample justifications for the ECB to also prioritize other considerations such as full employment or environmental protection,<ref>Blot, C., Creel, J., Faure, E. and Hubert, P., [https://www.europarl.europa.eu/cmsdata/207721/OFCE_FINAL2%20online.pdf Setting New Priorities for the ECB’s Mandate], Study for the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, Policy Department for Economic, Scientific and Quality of Life Policies, European Parliament, Luxembourg, 2020.</ref> which are mentioned in the Article 3 of the Treaty on the European Union. At the same time, economists and commentators are often divided on whether and how the ECB should pursue those secondary objectives, in particular the environmental impact.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.igmchicago.org/surveys/objectives-of-the-european-central-bank/|access-date=2020-11-25|website=www.igmchicago.org}}</ref> ECB official have also frequently pointed out the possible contradictions between those secondary objectives.<ref>"Certainly, the protection of the environment is not the only transversal objective assigned to EU institutions and hence to the ECB. Under the Treaty one could equally ask, for example, why the ECB should not promote industries that promise the strongest employment growth, irrespective of their ecological footprint. But equally importantly, the ECB is subject to the Treaty requirement to “act in accordance with the principle of an open market economy with free competition”. – [https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/key/date/2018/html/ecb.sp181108.en.html "Monetary policy and climate change], Speech from Benoit Cœuré, November 2018</ref> To better guide the ECB's action on its secondary objectives, it has been suggested that closer consultation with the European Parliament would be warranted.<ref>{{Cite web|title=How Can the European Parliament Better Oversee the European Central Bank? {{!}} Bruegel|url=https://www.bruegel.org/2020/09/how-can-the-european-parliament-better-oversee-the-european-central-bank/|access-date=2020-11-28|language=en-US}}</ref>

===Tasks===
{{one source|section|date=December 2015}}
To carry out its main mission, the ECB's tasks include:

* Defining and implementing '''monetary policy'''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/other/monetarypolicy2011en.pdf?4004e7099b3dcdbf58d0874f6eab650e|title=Monetary policy}}</ref>

* '''Financial stability and prudential policy'''
* '''Banking supervision:''' since 2013, the ECB has been put in charge of supervising systemically relevant banks.

===Monetary policy tools===
{{expand section|date=January 2016}}

The principal monetary policy tool of the European central bank is collateralised borrowing or repo agreements.<ref name="Euro debt crisis">{{cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/business/slide-show/slide-show-1-all-about-european-debt-crisis-in-simple-terms/20110819.htm |title=All about the European debt crisis: In SIMPLE terms|date=19 August 2011|access-date=28 October 2011|work=rediff business|publisher=rediff.com}}</ref> These tools are also used by the United States [[Federal Reserve Bank]], but the Fed does more direct purchasing of financial assets than its European counterpart.<ref name="US Open Market operations">{{cite web | url=http://www.newyorkfed.org/aboutthefed/fedpoint/fed32.html | title=Open Market Operation&nbsp;– Fedpoints&nbsp;– Federal Reserve Bank of New York | publisher=newyorkfed.org | work=Federal Reserve Bank of New York | date=August 2011 | access-date=29 October 2011}}</ref> The collateral used by the ECB is typically high quality public and private sector debt.<ref name="Euro debt crisis" />

All lending to credit institutions must be collateralised as required by Article 18 of the Statute of the ESCB.<ref>THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK HISTORY, ROLE AND FUNCTIONS BY HANSPETER K. SCHELLER SECOND REVISED EDITION 2006, {{ISBN|92-899-0022-9}} (print) {{ISBN|92-899-0027-X}} (online) page 87 at the pdf online version</ref> 

The criteria for determining "high quality" for public debt have been preconditions for membership in the European Union: total debt must not be too large in relation to gross domestic product, for example, and deficits in any given year must not become too large.<ref name="Euro debt working paper">{{cite web|url=http://unipub.lib.uni-corvinus.hu/304/1/wp_2011_1_darvas.pdf |title=WOrking paper 2011 / 1 A Comprehensive approach to the EUro-area debt crisis|date=February 2011|access-date=28 October 2011|work=Zsolt Darvas|publisher=Corvinus University of Budapest }}</ref> Though these criteria are fairly simple, a number of accounting techniques may hide the underlying reality of fiscal solvency—or the lack of same.<ref name="Euro debt working paper" />

In [[central banking]], the privileged status of the central bank is that it can make as much money as it deems needed.<ref name="Bernanke" /> In the [[Federal Reserve Bank|United States Federal Reserve Bank]], the Federal Reserve buys assets: typically, bonds issued by the Federal government.<ref name="Bernanke" /> There is no limit on the bonds that it can buy and one of the tools at its disposal in a financial crisis is to take such extraordinary measures as the purchase of large amounts of assets such as [[commercial paper]].<ref name="Bernanke" /> The purpose of such operations is to ensure that adequate liquidity is available for functioning of the financial system.<ref name="Bernanke">{{cite web|title=Federal Reserve Policies in the Financial Crisis|url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bernanke20081201a.htm|publisher=Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System|access-date=23 October 2011|author=Ben S. Bernanke|location=Greater Austin Chamber of Commerce, Austin, Texas|format=Speech|date=1 December 2008|quote=To ensure that adequate liquidity is available, consistent with the central bank's traditional role as the liquidity provider of last resort, the Federal Reserve has taken a number of extraordinary steps.}}</ref>

===Regulatory reliance on credit ratings===
Think-tanks such as the World Pensions Council have also argued that European legislators have pushed somewhat dogmatically for the adoption of the [[Basel II]] recommendations, adopted in 2005, transposed in European Union law through the [[Capital Requirements Directive]] (CRD), effective since 2008. In essence, they forced European banks, and, more importantly, the European Central Bank itself (e.g. when gauging the [[solvency]] of financial institutions) to rely more than ever on standardised assessments of [[credit risk]] marketed by two non-European private agencies: Moody's and S&P.

===Difference with US Federal Reserve===
In the United States, the [[Federal Reserve System]] purchases Treasury securities in order to inject liquidity into the economy. The [[Eurosystem]], on the other hand, uses a different method. There are about 1,500 eligible banks which may bid for short-term [[repurchase agreement|repo contracts]] of two weeks to three months duration.<ref>In practice, 400–500 banks participate regularly. <br />{{citation|author=Samuel Cheun|title=The collateral frameworks of the Eurosystem, the Federal Reserve System and the Bank of England and the financial market turmoil|date=December 2009|url=http://www.ecb.int/pub/pdf/scpops/ecbocp107.pdf|publisher=ECB|access-date=24 August 2011|author2=Isabel von Köppen-Mertes|author3=Benedict Weller}}</ref>

The banks in effect borrow cash and must pay it back; the short durations allow interest rates to be adjusted continually. When the repo notes come due the participating banks bid again. An increase in the quantity of notes offered at auction allows an increase in liquidity in the economy. A decrease has the contrary effect. The contracts are carried on the asset side of the European Central Bank's balance sheet and the resulting deposits in member banks are carried as a liability. In layman terms, the liability of the central bank is money, and an increase in deposits in member banks, carried as a liability by the central bank, means that more money has been put into the economy.{{efn|The process is similar, though on a grand scale, to an individual who every month charges $10,000 on his or her credit card, pays it off every month, but also withdraws (and pays off) an additional $10,000 each succeeding month for transaction purposes. Such a person is operating "net borrowed" on a continual basis, and even though the borrowing from the credit card is short term, the effect is a stable increase in the money supply. If the person borrows less, less money circulates in the economy. If he or she borrows more, the money supply increases. An individual's ability to borrow from his or her credit card company is determined by the credit card company: it reflects the company's overall judgment of its ability to lend to all borrowers, and also its appraisal of the financial condition of that one particular borrower. The ability of member banks to borrow from the central bank is fundamentally similar.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} }}

To qualify for participation in the auctions, banks must be able to offer proof of appropriate collateral in the form of loans to other entities. These can be the public debt of member states, but a fairly wide range of private banking securities are also accepted.<ref name="The ECB and the Eurosystem">{{cite journal|last=Bertaut|first=Carol C.|year=2002|title=The European Central Bank and the Eurosystem|url=http://www.bos.frb.org/economic/neer/neer2002/neer202e.pdf|journal=New England Economic Review|issue=2nd quarter|pages=25–28}}</ref>  The fairly stringent membership requirements for the European Union, especially with regard to [[sovereign debt]] as a percentage of each member state's gross domestic product, are designed to ensure that assets offered to the bank as collateral are, at least in theory, all equally good, and all equally protected from the risk of inflation.<ref name="The ECB and the Eurosystem" />

==Organization==
The ECB has four decision-making bodies, that take all the decisions with the objective of fulfilling the ECB's mandate:
* the Executive Board,
* the Governing Council,
* the General Council, and
* the Supervisory Board.

===Capital subscription===
{{Politics of the European Union}}
The ECB is governed by European law directly, but its set-up resembles that of a corporation in the sense that the ECB has shareholders and stock capital. Its initial capital was supposed to be €5 billion<ref>Article 28.1 of the ESCB Statute</ref> and the initial capital allocation key was determined in 1998 on the basis of the member states' populations and GDP,<ref name="capital"/><ref>Article 29 of the ESCB Statute</ref> but the key is adjustable.<ref>Article 28.5 of the ESCB Statute</ref> The euro area NCBs were required to pay their respective subscriptions to the ECB's capital in full. The NCBs of the non-participating countries have had to pay 7% of their respective subscriptions to the ECB's capital as a contribution to the operational costs of the ECB. As a result, the ECB was endowed with an initial capital of just under €4&nbsp;billion.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} The capital is held by the national central banks of the member states as shareholders. Shares in the ECB are not transferable and cannot be used as collateral.<ref>Article 28.4 of the ESCB Statute</ref> The NCBs are the sole subscribers to and holders of the capital of the ECB.

Today, ECB capital is about €11 billion, which is held by the national central banks of the member states as shareholders.<ref name="capital"/> The NCBs’ shares in this capital are calculated using a capital key which reflects the respective member's share in the total population and gross domestic product of the EU. The ECB adjusts the shares every five years and whenever the number of contributing NCBs changes. The adjustment is made on the basis of data provided by the European Commission.

All national central banks (NCBs) that own a share of the ECB capital stock as of 1 February 2020 are listed below. Non-Euro area NCBs are required to pay up only a very small percentage of their subscribed capital, which accounts for the different magnitudes of Euro area and Non-Euro area total paid-up capital.<ref name="capital">{{cite web|title=Capital Subscription|url=http://www.ecb.int/ecb/orga/capital/html/index.en.html|publisher=European Central Bank|access-date=1 February 2020}}</ref>

===Reserves===
In addition to capital subscriptions, the NCBs of the member states participating in the euro area provided the ECB with foreign reserve assets equivalent to around €40&nbsp;billion. The contributions of each NCB is in proportion to its share in the ECB's subscribed capital, while in return each NCB is credited by the ECB with a claim in euro equivalent to its contribution. 15% of the contributions was made in gold, and the remaining 85% in US dollars and UK pound Sterlings.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

===Languages===
The internal working language of the ECB is generally English, and press conferences are usually held in English. External communications are handled flexibly: English is preferred (though not exclusively) for communication within the ESCB (i.e. with other central banks) and with financial markets; communication with other national bodies and with EU citizens is normally in their respective language, but the ECB website is predominantly English; official documents such as the Annual Report are in the official languages of the EU.<ref>{{cite news|title=Translation Adds Complexity to European Central Bank's Supervisory Role: ECB Wants Communication in English, But EU Rules Allow Use of Any Official Language|first=Todd|last=Buell|date=29 October 2014|access-date=11 October 2015|newspaper=The Wall Street Journal|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/translation-adds-complexity-to-european-central-banks-supervisory-role-1414580925}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|page=26|title=The Application of multilingualism in the European Union Context|publisher=ECB|date=February 2006|access-date=11 October 2015|url=http://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scplps/ecblwp2.pdf|first=Phoebus|last= Athanassiou}}</ref>

===Independence===
The European Central Bank (and by extension, the Eurosystem) is often considered as the "most independent central bank in the world".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/key/date/1997/html/sp970513.en.html|title=The European Central Bank: independent and accountable|last=Bank|first=European Central|website=European Central Bank|language=en|access-date=5 November 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/key/date/1999/html/sp990504.en.html|title=The role of the Central Bank in the United Europe|last=Bank|first=European Central|website=European Central Bank|language=en|access-date=5 November 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Papadia|first1=Francesco|last2=Ruggiero|first2=Gian Paolo|date=1 February 1999|title=Central Bank Independence and Budget Constraints for a Stable Euro|journal=Open Economies Review|language=en|volume=10|issue=1|pages=63–90|doi=10.1023/A:1008305128157|s2cid=153508547|issn=0923-7992}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB902443500523452500|title=Is the ECB Too Independent?|last=Wood|first=Geoffrey|work=WSJ|access-date=5 November 2017|language=en-US}}</ref> In general terms, this means that the Eurosystem tasks and policies can be discussed, designed, decided and implemented in full autonomy, without pressure or need for instructions from any external body. The main justification for the ECB's independence is that such an institutional setup assists the maintenance of price stability.<ref name="Independence">{{cite web |url=http://www.ecb.int/ecb/orga/independence/html/index.en.html |title=Independence |publisher=European Central Bank |access-date=1 December 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ecb.europa.eu/explainers/tell-me-more/html/ecb_independent.en.html |title=Why is the ECB independent? |last=Bank |first=European Central |website=European Central Bank |language=en |access-date=5 November 2017}}</ref>

In practice, the ECB's independence is pinned by four key principles:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://transparency.eu/ecb|title=Transparency International EU – The global coalition against corruption in Brussels |last=EU |first=Transparency International |website=transparency.eu |language=en |access-date=5 November 2017 |date=28 March 2017}}</ref>

* '''Operational and legal independence''': the ECB has all required competences to achieve its price stability mandate{{Citation needed|date=August 2020}} and thereby can steer monetary policy in full autonomy and by means of high level of discretion. The ECB's governing council deliberates with a high degree of secrecy, since individual voting records are not disclosed to the public (leading to suspicions that Governing Council members are voting along national lines.<ref>Friedrich Heinemann and Felix Huefner (2004) 'Is the view from the Eurotower purely European? National divergence and ECB interest rate policy', ''Scottish Journal of Political Economy'' 51(4):544–558.</ref><ref>Jose Ramon Cancelo, Diego Varela and Jose Manuel Sanchez-Santos (2011) 'Interest rate setting at the ECB: Individual preferences and collective decision making', ''Journal of Policy Modeling'' 33(6): 804–820. [[doi:10.1016/j.jpolmod.2011.08.017|DOI]].</ref>) In addition to monetary policy decisions, the ECB has the right to issue legally binding regulations, within its competence and if the conditions laid down in Union law are fulfilled, it can sanction non-compliant actors if they violate legal requirements laid down in directly applicable Union regulations. The ECB's own legal personality also allows the ECB to enter into international legal agreements independently from other EU institutions, and be party of legal proceedings. Finally, the ECB can organise its internal structure as it sees fit. 
* '''Personal independence:''' the mandate of ECB board members is purposefully very long (8 years) and Governors of national central banks have a minimum renewable term of office of five years.<ref name="Independence" /> In addition, ECB board members and are vastly immune from judicial proceedings.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scplps/ecblwp4.pdf?581a2ecf674a6554f5af698f5bf54019|title=PRIVILEGES AND IMMUNITIES OF THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK|date=2007|website=European Central Bank}}</ref> Indeed, removals from office can only be decided by the [[Court of Justice of the European Union]] (CJEU), under the request of the ECB's Governing Council or the Executive Board (i.e. the ECB itself). Such decision is only possible in the event of incapacity or serious misconduct. National governors of the Eurosystem' national central banks can be dismissed under national law (with possibility to appeal) in case they can no longer fulfil their functions or are guilty of serious misconduct.
* '''Financial independence''': the ECB is the only body within the EU whose statute guarantees budgetary independence through its own resources and income. The ECB uses its own profits generated by its monetary policy operations and cannot be technically insolvent. The ECB's financial independence reinforces its political independence. Because the ECB does not require external financing and symmetrically is prohibited from direct financing to public institutions, this shields it from potential pressure from public authorities.
*'''Political independence''': The Community institutions and bodies and the governments of the member states may not seek to influence the members of the decision-making bodies of the ECB or of the NCBs in the performance of their tasks. Symmetrically, EU institutions and national governments are bound by the treaties to respect the ECB's independence. It is the latter which is the subject of much debate.

===Democratic accountability===
In return to its high degree of independence and discretion, the ECB is accountable to the [[European Parliament]] (and to a lesser extent to the European Court of Auditors, the European Ombudsman and the Court of Justice of the EU (CJEU)). Although no interinstitutional agreement exists between the European Parliament and the ECB to regulate the ECB's accountability framework, it has been inspired by a resolution of the European Parliament adopted in 1998<ref>{{Cite web|title=Report on democratic accountability in the third phase of European Monetary Union – Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy – A4-0110/1998|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?type=REPORT&reference=A4-1998-0110&language=EN|access-date=8 October 2018|website=europarl.europa.eu|language=en}}</ref> which was then informally agreed with the ECB and incorporated into the Parliament's rule of procedure.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Bank|first=European Central|title=The evolution of the ECB's accountability practices during the crisis|url=https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/economic-bulletin/articles/2018/html/ecb.ebart201805_01.en.html|access-date=8 October 2018|website=European Central Bank|language=en}}</ref>

The accountability framework involves five main mechanisms:<ref>{{Cite web|last=Bank|first=European Central|title=Accountability|url=https://www.ecb.europa.eu/ecb/orga/accountability/html/index.en.html|access-date=2020-11-25|website=European Central Bank|language=en}}</ref>

* '''Annual report:''' the ECB is bound to publish reports on its activities and has to address its annual report to the [[European Parliament]] , the [[European Commission]] , the [[Council of the European Union]] and the [[European Council]] .<ref name="ECB Acc">{{cite web|title=Accountability|url=http://www.ecb.int/ecb/orga/accountability/html/index.en.html|access-date=15 October 2007|publisher=European Central Bank}}</ref> In return, the European Parliament evaluates the past activities to the ECB via its annual report on the European Central Bank (which is essentially a non legally-binding list of resolutions).

In 2013, an interinstitutional agreement was reached between the ECB and the European Parliament in the context of the establishment of the ECB's Banking Supervision. This agreement sets broader powers to the European Parliament than the established practice on the monetary policy side of the ECB's activities. For example, under the agreement, the Parliament can veto the appointment of the Chair and Vice-Chair of the ECB's supervisory board, and may approve removals if requested by the ECB.<ref>{{cite web|title=Interinstitutional Agreement between the European Parliament and the European Central Bank on the practical modalities of the exercise of democratic accountability and oversight over the exercise of the tasks conferred on the ECB within the framework of the Single Supervisory Mechanism|url=https://www.ecb.europa.eu/ecb/legal/pdf/celex_32013q113001_en_txt.pdf}}</ref>

=== Transparency ===
In addition to its independence, the ECB is subject to limited transparency obligations in contrast to EU Institutions standards and other major central banks. Indeed, as pointed out by [[Transparency International]], "The Treaties establish transparency and openness as principles of the EU and its institutions. They do, however, grant the ECB a partial exemption from these principles. According to Art. 15(3) TFEU, the ECB is bound by the EU’s transparency principles “only when exercising [its] administrative tasks” (the exemption – which leaves the term “administrative tasks” undefined – equally applies to the Court of Justice of the European Union and to the European Investment Bank)."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://transparency.eu/ecb/ |title=Transparency International EU – The global coalition against corruption in Brussels |last=EU |first=Transparency International |website=transparency.eu |language=en |access-date=5 November 2017|date=28 March 2017}}</ref>

In practice, there are several concrete examples where the ECB is less transparent than other institutions:
* '''Voting secrecy''' : while other central banks publish the voting record of its decision makers, the ECB's Governing Council decisions are made in full discretion. Since 2014, the ECB has published "accounts" of its monetary policy meetings,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pr/date/2014/html/pr140703_1.en.html |title=ECB to adjust schedule of meetings and to publish regular accounts of monetary policy discussions in 2015 |last=Bank |first=European Central |website=European Central Bank |language=en |access-date=5 November 2017}}</ref> but those remain rather vague and do not include individual votes.
* '''Access to documents''' : The obligation for EU bodies to make documents freely accessible after a 30-year embargo applies to the ECB. However, under the ECB's Rules of Procedure the Governing Council may decide to keep individual documents classified beyond the 30-year period.<!-- Art. 23.3 Rules of Procedure. See also CJEU in joined cases T-3/00 and T-337/04 -->
* '''Disclosure of securities:''' The ECB is less transparent than the Fed when it comes to disclosing the list of securities being held in its balance sheet under monetary policy operations such as QE.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://bruegel.org/2017/11/the-eurosystem-too-opaque-and-costly/|title=The Eurosystem – Too opaque and costly? {{!}} Bruegel|website=bruegel.org|language=en-US|access-date=7 November 2017}}</ref>

== Debates surrounding the ECB ==

=== Debates on ECB independence ===
{{Essay-like|section|date=May 2020}}

==== The arguments in favour of this independence ====
The debate on the independence of the ECB has its origins in the preparatory stages of the construction of the EMU. The German government agreed to go ahead if certain crucial guarantees were respected, such as a European Central Bank independent of national governments and shielded from political pressure along the lines of the German central bank. The French government, for its part, feared that this independence would mean that politicians would no longer have any room for manoeuvre in the process. A compromise was then reached by establishing a regular dialogue between the ECB and the Council of Finance Ministers of the euro area, the Eurogroupe.

The founding model of the ECB, as advocated by the German government, is explained in an article published in 1983 by two economists, Robert Barro and David Gordon.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Barro|first1=Robert|last2=Gordon|first2=David|date=February 1983|title=Rules, Discretion and Reputation in a Model of Monetary Policy|location=Cambridge, MA|doi=10.3386/w1079|doi-access=free}}</ref> According to them, the best way to combat the inflationary bias is for central banks to be credible. This credibility would be all the more important if the central banks were independent, so that decisions are not "contaminated" by politics. For economists, central banks should then have only one objective: to maintain a low inflation rate. For this system to work, it would then be necessary to assume that a monetary policy conducted in this way would have no effect on the real economy.

Since that publication, it has often been accepted that an independent institution to manage monetary policy can help to limit chronic inflation. This model was generalised in various variations at the national levels before being adopted at the European level.<ref name="Barbier-Gauchard, Amélie 1978-....">{{Cite book|last=Barbier-Gauchard, Amélie (1978–....).|title=La gouvernance économique de la zone euro : réalités et perspectives|date=15 May 2018|others=Sidiropoulos, Moïse., Varoudakis, Aristomène (1958–....)., De Grauwe, Paul (1946–....).|isbn=978-2-8073-2010-9|location=Louvain-la-Neuve|oclc=1041143371}}</ref>

The original European project, as intended by the founding fathers, did not attract the passions and favours of the European peoples. And rightly so. This project is thought out openly on purely technical subjects that are of little or no interest to public opinion. As a result, the founding fathers hoped that economic and ethical rationality could be exercised in all its fullness without political, ideological or historical obstacles. It is this rational messianism that the radical left has always fought against.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bouillaud|first=Christophe|date=2018|title=Bernard Bruneteau, Combattre l'Europe. De Lénine à Marine Le Pen, Paris, CNRS Éditions, 2018, 303 pages|url=http://www.cairn.info/revue-politique-europeenne-2018-4-page-186.htm?ref=doi|journal=Politique Européenne|language=fr|volume=N° 62|issue=4|pages=186|doi=10.3917/poeu.062.0186|issn=1623-6297}}</ref> Moreover, this project is presented as heir to the Enlightenment and Reason, the reign of human rights, a modernist and voluntarist project stemming from the tradition of the 18th century.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bouillaud|first=Christophe|date=2018|title=Bernard Bruneteau, Combattre l'Europe.

It is difficult, if not impossible, for them to conceive of a democratisation of the ECB by attaching to it a share of political control in its operation without distorting the "European Project", this bible, this unique political reason which has guided professionals in Europe for generations.

In this same idea, we can find in the "European Project" the Kantian tradition with a model of successful subordination of political power to the law, leading to what Habermas calls "the civilising force of democratic legalification". This Habermatian theory leads us once again to isolate supranational institutions from political games. Indeed, for Habermas, European politics, like national politics for that matter, finds it impossible to define ONE uniform people, but at best a pluriform people in constant opposition, each component against the other. For this author, popular sovereignty is illusory, as is the concept of "government by the people". He prefers the search for a broad consensus legitimized by the majority of democratically elected representatives of the people.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Dialogues avec Jürgen Habermas|others=Aubert, Isabelle, 1979–, Kervégan, Jean-François|isbn=978-2-271-11596-6|location=Paris|oclc=1065711045}}</ref> This explains his attachment to deflecting the influence of popular emotions from technical institutions, such as the ECB.

==== The arguments against too much independence ====

===== An independence that would be the source of a democratic deficit. =====
'''Demystify the independence of central bankers''' :According to Christopher Adolph (2009),<ref name="Adolph, Christopher, 1976–2013">{{Cite book|last=Adolph, Christopher, 1976–|title=Bankers, bureaucrats, and central bank politics : the myth of neutrality|date=2013|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-61681-2|location=New York|oclc=844940155}}</ref> the alleged neutrality of central bankers is only a legal façade and not an indisputable fact . To achieve this, the author analyses the professional careers of central bankers and mirrors them with their respective monetary decision-making. To explain the results of his analysis, he utilizes he uses the "''principal-agent''" theory.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Elgie|first=Robert|date=January 2002|title=The politics of the European Central Bank: principal-agent theory and the democratic deficit|url=http://doras.dcu.ie/65/2/ECB_JEPP.pdf|journal=Journal of European Public Policy|language=en|volume=9|issue=2|pages=186–200|doi=10.1080/13501760110120219|issn=1350-1763|s2cid=53073648}}</ref> To explain that in order to create a new entity, one needs a delegator or ''principal'' (in this case the heads of state or government of the euro area) and a delegate or ''agent'' (in this case the ECB). In his illustration, he describes the financial community as a "''shadow principale''"<ref name="Adolph, Christopher, 1976–2013"/>  which influences the choice of central bankers thus indicating that the central banks indeed act as interfaces between the financial world and the States. It is therefore not surprising, still according to the author, to regain their influence and preferences in the appointment of central bankers, presumed conservative, neutral and impartial according to the model of the [[Independent Central Bank (ICB)]],<ref>{{Cite book|last=Johnson, Peter A. (Peter Andrew)|title=The government of money : monetarism in Germany and the United States|date=15 May 2019|isbn=978-1-5017-4453-2|location=Ithaca, N.Y.|oclc=1112670669}}</ref> which eliminates this famous "''[[temporal inconsistency]]''".<ref name="Adolph, Christopher, 1976–2013"/> Central bankers had a professional life before joining the central bank and their careers will most likely continue after their tenure. They are ultimately human beings. Therefore, for the author, central bankers have interests of their own, based on their past careers and their expectations after joining the ECB, and try to send messages to their future potential employers.

'''The crisis: an opportunity to impose its will and extend its powers''' :

– ''Its participation in the [[European troika|troika]]'' : Thanks to its three factors which explains its independence, the ECB took advantage of this crisis to implement, through its participation in the troika, the famous structural reforms in the Member States aimed at making, more flexible the various markets, particularly the labour market, which are still considered too rigid under the [[ordoliberal concept]].<ref name="Delaume 2015 75">{{Cite journal|last=Delaume|first=Coralie|date=2015|title=Où va la Banque centrale européenne ?: De la technique à la politique, sans la démocratie|url=http://www.cairn.info/revue-le-debat-2015-5-page-75.htm|journal=Le Débat|language=fr|volume=187|issue=5|pages=75|doi=10.3917/deba.187.0075|issn=0246-2346}}</ref>

- ''[[Macro-prudential supervision]]'' : At the same time, taking advantage of the reform of the financial supervision system, the Frankfurt Bank has acquired new responsibilities, such as macro-prudential supervision, in other words, supervision of the provision of financial services.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Fontan|first=Clément|date=2010|title=Chantiers de recherche transfert d'idée et résistances au changement : le cas de la banque centrale européenne après la crise.: Questionnement scientifique et objectifs de la thèse|url=http://www.cairn.info/revue-politique-europeenne-2010-1-page-225.htm|journal=Politique Européenne|language=fr|volume=30|issue=1|pages=225|doi=10.3917/poeu.030.0225|issn=1623-6297}}</ref>

-''Take liberties with its mandate to save the Euro'' : Paradoxically, the crisis undermined the ECB's ordoliberal discourse "because some of its instruments, which it had to implement, deviated significantly from its principles. It then interpreted the paradigm with enough flexibly to adapt its original reputation to these new economic conditions. It was forced to do so as a last resort to save its one and only raison d'être: the euro. This Independent was thus obliged to be pragmatic by departing from the spirit of its statutes, which is unacceptable to the hardest supporters of ordoliberalism, which will lead to the resignation of the two German leaders present within the ECB: the governor of the Bundesbank, Jens WEIDMANN<ref>{{Cite web|last=Raymond|first=Grégory|title=Jens Weidmann, l'homme qui dit "non" à toute l'Europe|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.fr/2012/08/30/jens-weidmann-bundesbank-draghi-merkel-euro_n_1843003.html?utm_hp_ref=economie|website=huffingtonpost.fr}}</ref> and the member of the Executive Board of the ECB, Jürgen STARK.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Reuters|date=11 September 2011|title=La démission de Jürgen Stark de la BCE vient au pire moment|url=https://www.lexpress.fr/archives/economie/2011/09/11/|website=lexpansion.lexpress.fr/}}</ref>

– ''Regulation of the financial system'' :  The delegation of this new function to the ECB was carried out with great simplicity and with the consent of European leaders, because neither the Commission nor the Member States really wanted to obtain the monitoring of financial abuses throughout the area. In other words, in the event of a new financial crisis, the ECB would be the perfect scapegoat.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lebaron|first=Frédéric|date=2014|title=Quand le gardien du Temple devient le sauveur des marchés financiers|url=http://www.cairn.info/revue-savoir-agir-2014-1-page-5.htm|journal=Savoir/Agir|language=fr|volume=27|issue=1|pages=5|doi=10.3917/sava.027.0005|issn=1958-7856}}</ref>

- ''Capturing exchange rate policy'' : The event that will most mark the definitive politicization of the ECB is, of course, the operation launched in January 2015: the [[quantitative easing]] (QE) operation. Indeed, the Euro is an overvalued currency on the world markets against the dollar and the Euro zone is at risk of deflation. In addition, Member States find themselves heavily indebted, partly due to the rescue of their national banks. The ECB, as the guardian of the stability of the euro zone, is deciding to gradually buy back more than EUR 1 100 billion Member States' public debt. In this way, money is injected back into the economy, the euro depreciates significantly, prices rise, the risk of deflation is removed, and Member States reduce their debts. However, the ECB has just given itself the right to direct the exchange rate policy of the euro zone without this being granted by the Treaties or with the approval of European leaders, and without public opinion or the public arena being aware of this.<ref name="Delaume 2015 75"/>

In conclusion, for those in favour of a framework for ECB independence, there is a clear concentration of powers. In the light of these facts, it is clear that the ECB is no longer the simple guardian of monetary stability in the euro area, but has become, over the course of the crisis, a "''multi-competent economic player, at ease in this role that no one, especially not the agnostic governments of the euro Member States, seems to have the idea of challenging''".<ref name="Delaume 2015 75"/> This new political super-actor, having captured many spheres of competence and a very strong influence in the economic field in the broad sense (economy, finance, budget...).  This new political super-actor can no longer act alone and refuse a counter-power, consubstantial to our liberal democracies.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Béland|first=Daniel|date=May 2010|title=The Idea of Power and the Role of Ideas|journal=Political Studies Review|language=en|volume=8|issue=2|pages=145–154|doi=10.1111/j.1478-9302.2009.00199.x|issn=1478-9299|s2cid=145108543}}</ref> Indeed, the status of independence which the ECB enjoys by essence should not exempt it from a real responsibility regarding the democratic process.

===== The arguments in favour of a counter power =====
In the aftermath of the euro area crisis, several proposals for a countervailing power were put forward, to deal with criticisms of a democratic deficit. For the German economist German Issing (2001) the ECB as a democratic responsibility and should be more transparent. According to him, this transparence could bring several advantages as the improvement of the efficiency and of the credibility by giving to the public adequate information. Others think that the ECB should have a closer relationship with the European Parliament which could play a major role in the evaluation of the democratic responsibility of the ECB.<ref name="Barbier-Gauchard, Amélie 1978-...."/> The development of new institutions or the creation of a minister is another solution proposed:

'''A minister for the Eurozone ?'''

The idea of a eurozone finance minister is regularly raised and supported by certain political figures, including Emmanuel Macron, as well as German Chancellor Angela Merkel,<ref>SEIBT Sébastien, Ministre des finances de la zone euro, Merkel ne dit pas non, France 24, 13/07/[https://www.france24.com/fr/20170713-merkel-macron-ministre-finances-commun-zone-euro-economie-ue 2017]</ref> former President of the ECB Jean-Claude Trichet and former European Commissioner Pierre Moscovici. For the latter, this position would bring "''more democratic legitimacy''" and "''more efficiency''" to European politics. In his view, it is a question of merging the powers of Commissioner for the Economy and Finance with those of the President of the Eurogroup.<ref>{{Cite news|date=2 October 2017|title=Ministre des Finances zone euro : "je connais bien le job" (Moscovici)|work=Le Figaro|url=https://www.lefigaro.fr/flash-eco/2017/10/02/97002-20171002FILWWW00065-ministre-des-finances-zone-euro-je-connais-bien-le-job-moscovici.php|access-date=28 March 2020}}</ref>

The main task of this minister would be to "represent a strong political authority protecting the economic and budgetary interests of the euro area as a whole, and not the interests of individual Member States". According to the Jacques Delors Institute, its competences could be as follows:

* Supervising the coordination of economic and budgetary policies
* Enforcing the rules in case of infringement
* Conducting negotiations in a crisis context
* Contributing to cushioning regional shocks
* Representing the euro area in international institutions and fora<ref>{{Cite web|last=Enderlein|first=Henrik|date=October 2015|title=QUEL SERAIT LE RÔLE D'UN MINISTRE EUROPÉEN DES FINANCES ? UNE PROPOSITION|url=https://hertieschool-f4e6.kxcdn.com/fileadmin/user_upload/MinistreFinancesEurropeen_JDI-B_FR1.pdf|access-date=28 March 2020}}</ref>

For Jean-Claude Trichet, this minister could also rely on the Eurogroup working group for the preparation and follow-up of meetings in euro zone format, and on the Economic and Financial Committee for meetings concerning all Member States. He would also have under his authority a General Secretariat of the Treasury of the euro area, whose tasks would be determined by the objectives of the budgetary union currently being set up <ref>{{Citation|last1=Chopin|first1=Thierry|title=Europe — Afterwards.

This proposal was nevertheless rejected in 2017 by the Eurogroup, its President, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, spoke of the importance of this institution in relation to the European Commission.<ref>{{Cite news|date=7 December 2017|title=L'Eurogroupe rejette l'idée d'un ministre européen des Finances|work=Ouest France|url=https://www.ouest-france.fr/economie/banques-finance/zone-euro/l-eurogroupe-rejette-l-idee-d-un-ministre-europeen-des-finances-5430414|access-date=28 March 2020}}</ref>

'''Towards democratic institutions ?'''

The absence of democratic institutions such as a Parliament or a real government is a regular criticism of the ECB in its management of the euro area, and many proposals have been made in this respect, particularly after the economic crisis, which would have shown the need to improve the governance of the euro area. For Moïse Sidiropoulos, a professor in economy: “The crisis in the euro zone came as no surprise, because the euro remains an unfinished currency, a stateless currency with a fragile political legitimacy”.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2019|title=L'euro reste une monnaie inachevée|url=http://www.recherche.unistra.fr/index.php?id=30096|website=Université de Strasbourg}}</ref>

French economist Thomas Piketty wrote on his blog in 2017 that it was essential to equip the euro zone with democratic institutions. An economic government could for example enable it to have a common budget, common taxes and borrowing and investment capacities. Such a government would then make the euro area more democratic and transparent by avoiding the opacity of a council such as the Eurogroup.

Nevertheless, according to him "''there is no point in talking about a government of the euro zone if we do not say to which democratic body this government will be accountable''", a real parliament of the euro zone to which a finance minister would be accountable seems to be the real priority for the economist, who also denounces the lack of action in this area.<ref>{{Cite news|last=PIKETTY|first=Thomas|date=1 February 2017|title=Pour un gouvernement enfin démocratique de la zone euro|work=Le Monde|url=https://www.lemonde.fr/blog/piketty/2017/02/01/pour-un-vrai-gouvernement-de-la-zone-euro/|access-date=28 March 2020}}</ref>

The creation of a sub-committee within the current European Parliament was also mentioned, on the model of the Eurogroup, which is currently an under-formation of the ECOFIN Committee. This would require a simple amendment to the rules of procedure and would avoid a competitive situation between two separate parliamentary assemblies. The former President of the European Commission had, moreover, stated on this subject that he had "no sympathy for the idea of a specific Eurozone Parliament".<ref>{{Cite web|date=September 2014|title=RÉFORMER LA " GOUVERNANCE " EUROPÉENNE POUR UNE FÉDÉRATION D'ÉTATS NATIONS PLUS LÉGITIME ET PLUS EFFICACE|url=https://institutdelors.eu/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/reformergouvernanceue-bertoncini-vitorino-ne-ijd-sept14.pdf|website=Institut Jacques Delors}}</ref>
