'''Tobacco''' is the common name of several plants in the ''[[Nicotiana]]'' [[genus]] and the [[Solanaceae]] (nightshade) [[Family (biology)|family]], and the general term for any product prepared from the [[curing of tobacco|cured]] [[leaves]] of the tobacco plant. [[Nicotiana#Species|More than 70 species]] of tobacco are known, but the chief commercial crop is [[Nicotiana tabacum|''N. tabacum'']]. The more potent variant [[Nicotiana rustica|''N. rustica'']] is also used around the world.

Tobacco contains the highly addictive [[stimulant]] [[alkaloid]] [[nicotine]] as well as [[harmala alkaloid]]s.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Rudgley|first1=Richard|title=Tobacco: from The Encyclopedia of Psychoactive Substances|url=https://www.biopsychiatry.com/tobacco/|website=Biopsychiatry|publisher=Little, Brown and Company (1998)|access-date=November 26, 2017}}</ref> Dried tobacco leaves are mainly used for [[Tobacco smoking|smoking]] in [[cigarette]]s and [[cigar]]s, as well as [[pipe smoking|pipes]] and [[Mu'assel|shishas]]. They can also be consumed as [[Snuff (tobacco)|snuff]], [[chewing tobacco]], [[dipping tobacco]] and [[snus]].

Tobacco use is a cause or risk factor for many diseases; especially those affecting the [[heart]], [[liver]], and [[lungs]], as well as [[Health effects of tobacco#Cancer|many cancers]]. In 2008, the [[World Health Organization]] named tobacco use as the world's single greatest preventable cause of death.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.who.int/tobacco/mpower/mpower_report_forward_summary_2008.pdf|title=WHO Report on the global tobacco epidemic, 2008 (foreword and summary)|publisher=[[World Health Organization]]|year=2008|page=8|quote=Tobacco is the single most preventable cause of death in the world today.}}</ref>

==Etymology==
The English word ''tobacco'' originates from the Spanish and Portuguese word "tabaco". The precise origin of this word is disputed, but it is generally thought to have derived at least in part, from [[Taíno language|Taíno]], the [[Arawakan]] language of the [[Caribbean]]. In Taíno, it was said to mean either a roll of tobacco leaves (according to [[Bartolomé de las Casas]], 1552), or to ''tabago'', a kind of L-shaped pipe used for sniffing tobacco smoke (according to Oviedo, with the leaves themselves being referred to as ''cohiba'').<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wais.stanford.edu/Cuba/cuba_ColumbusDiscoversCuba(110503).html|title=World Association of International Studies, Stanford University}}</ref><ref name="Ernst">{{cite journal|last1=Ernst|first1=A.|title=On the etymology of the word tobacco|journal=The American Anthropologist|date=1889|volume=A2|issue=2|pages=133–142|doi=10.1525/aa.1889.2.2.02a00020|url=https://zenodo.org/record/1448956}}</ref>

However, perhaps coincidentally, similar words in Spanish, Portuguese and Italian were used from 1410 for certain medicinal [[herb]]s. These probably derived from the Arabic {{lang|ar|طُبّاق|rtl=yes}} {{transl|ar|ṭubbāq}} (also {{lang|ar|طُباق|rtl=yes}} {{transl|ar|ṭubāq}}), a word reportedly dating to the 9th century, referring to various herbs.<ref>[http://ejtaal.net/aa/#hw4=h660,ll=1916,ls=5,la=2636,sg=645,ha=438,pr=97,vi=240,mgf=549,mr=381,mn=839,aan=360,kz=1457,ulq=1133,uqa=265,uqw=990,umr=652,ums=546,umj=489,uqq=210,bdw=549,amr=392,asb=593,auh=947,dhq=338,mht=549,msb=147,tla=68,amj=481,ens=1,mis=1311 Lane's Lexicon]. page 1879.</ref><ref>The word {{transl|ar|ṭubāq}} no longer refers to various herbs, but has come to refer, in some dialects, specifically to tobacco.

===Traditional use===

[[File:Rajput (Jodhpur) (8411728143).jpg|thumb|An [[Indian people|Indian]] man smoking tobacco on [[hookah]], [[Rajasthan, India]].]]
Tobacco has long been used in the Americas, with some cultivation sites in Mexico dating back to 1400–1000 BC.<ref>Goodman, Jordan. ''Tobacco in History and Culture: An Encyclopedia'' (Detroit: Thomson Gale, 2005).</ref> Many Native American tribes traditionally grow and use tobacco. Historically, people from the [[Indigenous peoples of the Northeastern Woodlands|Northeast Woodlands cultures]] have carried tobacco in pouches as a readily accepted trade item. It was smoked both socially and [[Ceremonial pipe|ceremonially]], such as to seal a peace treaty or trade agreement.<ref>e.g. Heckewelder, ''History, Manners and Customs of the Indian Nations who Once Inhabited Pennsylvania'', p. 149 ff.</ref><ref>"They smoke with excessive eagerness&nbsp;... men, women, girls and boys, all find their keenest pleasure in this way." - Dièreville describing the [[Mi'kmaq people|Mi'kmaq]], ''circa'' 1699 in ''Port Royal''.</ref> In some Native cultures, tobacco is seen as a gift from the [[Creator deity|Creator]], with the ceremonial tobacco smoke carrying one's thoughts and prayers to the Creator.<ref>Jack Jacob Gottsegen, ''Tobacco: A Study of Its Consumption in the United States'', 1940, p. 107.</ref>

===Popularization===
[[File:A Smoking Club.jpeg|thumb|An illustration from [[Frederick William Fairholt]]'s ''Tobacco, its History and Association'', 1859]]
[[File:KITLV - 26868 - Kleingrothe, C.J. - Medan - Tobacco plant and tobacco leaf, Deli - circa 1905.tif|thumb|Tobacco plant and tobacco leaf from the [[Deli Company|Deli plantations]] in Sumatra, 1905]]
Following the arrival of the Europeans to the Americas, tobacco became increasingly popular as a trade item. [[Hernández de Boncalo]], Spanish chronicler of the Indies, was the first European to bring tobacco seeds to the [[Old World]] in 1559 following orders of King [[Philip II of Spain]]. These seeds were planted in the outskirts of [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]], more specifically in an area known as "Los Cigarrales" named after the continuous plagues of cicadas (''cigarras'' in Spanish). Before the development of the lighter Virginia and white burley strains of tobacco, the smoke was too harsh to be inhaled. Small quantities were smoked at a time, using a pipe like the ''[[midwakh]]'' or ''[[kiseru]],'' or newly invented waterpipes such as the [[bong]] or the [[hookah]] (see [[Nicotiana rustica#Thuốc lào|thuốc lào]] for a modern continuance of this practice). Tobacco became so popular that the English colony of Jamestown used it as currency and began exporting it as a cash crop; tobacco is often credited as being the export that saved Virginia from ruin.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Relentless Revolution: A History of Capitalism|last=Appleby|first=Joyce|publisher=W.W. Norton & Company|year=2010|pages=131}}</ref>

The alleged benefits of tobacco also contributed to its success. The astronomer [[Thomas Harriot]], who accompanied [[Sir Richard Grenville]] on his 1585 expedition to [[Roanoke Island]], thought that the plant "openeth all the pores and passages of the body" so that the bodies of the natives "are notably preserved in health, and know not many grievous diseases, wherewithal we in England are often times afflicted." <ref>Harriot, Thomas, A Brief and True Report of the New Found Land of Virginia, 1590, http://www.gutenberg.org/files/4247/4247-h/4247-h.htm</ref> 

Production of tobacco for smoking, chewing, and snuffing became a major industry in Europe and its colonies by 1700.<ref>Eric Burns, ''The Smoke of the Gods: A Social History of Tobacco'' (2006), A popular history focused on the US.</ref><ref>Jordan Goodman, ''Tobacco in History: The Cultures of Dependence'' (1993), A scholarly history worldwide.</ref>

Tobacco has been a major [[cash crop]] in Cuba and in other parts of the Caribbean since the 18th century. Cuban cigars are world-famous.<ref>Charlotte Cosner, ''The Golden Leaf: How Tobacco Shaped Cuba and the Atlantic World'' (Vanderbilt University Press; 2015)</ref>

In the late 19th century, cigarettes became popular. [[James Bonsack]] invented a machine to automate cigarette production. This increase in production allowed tremendous growth in the [[tobacco industry]] until the health revelations of the late 20th century.<ref>Richard Kluger, ''Ashes to Ashes: America's Hundred-Year Cigarette War'' (1996)</ref><ref>Allan Brandt, ''The Cigarette Century: The Rise, Fall, and Deadly Persistence of the Product That Defined America'' (2007)</ref>

===Contemporary===
{{See also|Tobacco control|Tobacco in the United States}}
Following the scientific revelations of the mid-20th century, tobacco was condemned as a health hazard, and eventually became recognized as a cause of cancer, as well as other respiratory and circulatory diseases. In the United States, this led to the [[Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement]], which settled the many lawsuits by the U.S. states in exchange for a combination of yearly payments to the states and voluntary restrictions on advertising and marketing of tobacco products.

In the 1970s, [[Brown & Williamson]] cross-bred a strain of tobacco to produce [[Y1 (tobacco)|Y1]], a strain containing an unusually high nicotine content, nearly doubling from 3.2-3.5% to 6.5%. In the 1990s, this prompted the [[Food and Drug Administration]] to allege that [[tobacco industry|tobacco companies]] were intentionally manipulating the nicotine content of [[cigarette]]s.

In 2003, in response to growth of tobacco use in developing countries, the World Health Organization<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.who.int/fctc/en/index.html|title=WHO &#124; WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC)|publisher=Who.int|access-date=September 18, 2008}}</ref> successfully rallied 168 countries to sign the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control. The convention is designed to push for effective legislation and enforcement in all countries to reduce the harmful effects of tobacco. 

The desire of many addicted smokers to quit has led to the development of [[nicotine replacement therapy|tobacco cessation products]].

[[File:Native American tobacco flower.jpg|thumb|upright|Tobacco (''[[Nicotiana rustica]]'') flower, leaves, and buds]]
Many species of tobacco are in the genus of herbs ''Nicotiana''. It is part of the nightshade [[family (biology)|family]] ([[Solanaceae]]) indigenous to [[North America|North]] and [[South America]], [[Australia]], south west [[Africa]], and the [[Oceania|South Pacific]].<ref name="Lewis">{{cite journal|last1=Lewis|first1=Albert|title=Tobacco in New Guinea|journal=The American Anthropologist|date=1931|volume=33|issue=1|pages=134–139|doi=10.1525/aa.1931.33.1.02a00290}}</ref>

Most nightshades contain varying amounts of [[nicotine]], a powerful [[neurotoxin]] to [[insect]]s. However, tobaccos tend to contain a much higher concentration of nicotine than the others. Unlike many other Solanaceae species, they do not contain [[tropane alkaloid]]s, which are often poisonous to humans and other animals.

Despite containing enough nicotine and other compounds such as [[germacrene]] and [[anabasine]] and other [[piperidine]] alkaloids (varying between species) to deter most [[herbivore]]s,<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Panter |first1=KE |last2=Keeler |first2=RF |last3=Bunch |first3=TD |last4=Callan |first4=RJ |year=1990 |title=Congenital skeletal malformations and cleft palate induced in goats by ingestion of Lupinus, Conium and Nicotiana species  |journal=Toxicon |pages=1377–1385 |volume=28 |issue=12 |pmid=2089736|doi=10.1016/0041-0101(90)90154-Y }}</ref> a number of such animals have [[evolution|evolve]]d the ability to feed on ''Nicotiana'' species without being harmed. Nonetheless, tobacco is unpalatable to many species due to its other attributes. For example, although the [[cabbage looper]] is a generalist pest, tobacco's gummosis and trichomes can harm early larvae survival.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Elsey|first1=K. D.|last2=Rabb|first2=R.

===Types===
{{Main|Types of tobacco}}

The types of tobacco include:

* [[Types of tobacco#Aromatic Fire-cured|Aromatic fire-cured]] is cured by smoke from open fires. In the United States, it is grown in northern middle Tennessee, central Kentucky, and [[Virginia]]. Fire-cured tobacco grown in [[Kentucky]] and [[Tennessee]] is used in some chewing tobaccos, moist snuff, some cigarettes, and as a condiment in pipe tobacco blends. Another fire-cured tobacco is [[Latakia (tobacco)|Latakia]], which is produced from oriental varieties of ''N. tabacum''. The leaves are cured and smoked over smoldering fires of local hardwoods and aromatic shrubs in [[Cyprus]] and [[Syria]].
* [[Types of tobacco#Brightleaf tobacco|Brightleaf tobacco]] is commonly known as "Virginia tobacco", often regardless of the state where it is planted. Prior to the [[American Civil War]], most tobacco grown in the US was fire-cured dark-leaf. Sometime after the [[War of 1812]], demand for a milder, lighter, more aromatic tobacco arose. [[Ohio]], [[Pennsylvania]] and [[Maryland]] all innovated with milder varieties of the tobacco plant. Farmers discovered that Bright leaf tobacco needs thin, starved soil, and those who could not grow other crops found that they could grow tobacco. Confederate soldiers traded it with each other and Union soldiers, and developed quite a taste for it. At the end of the war, the soldiers went home and a national market had developed for the local crop.
* [[Burley (tobacco)|Burley tobacco]] is an air-cured tobacco used primarily for [[cigarette]] production. In the U.S., burley tobacco plants are started from pelletized seeds placed in polystyrene trays floated on a bed of fertilized water in March or April.
* [[Cavendish tobacco|Cavendish]] is more a process of curing and a method of cutting tobacco than a type. The processing and the cut are used to bring out the natural sweet taste in the tobacco. Cavendish can be produced from any tobacco type, but is usually one of, or a blend of Kentucky, Virginia, and burley, and is most commonly used for pipe tobacco and cigars.
* [[Criollo tobacco]] is primarily used in the making of [[cigar]]s. It was, by most accounts, one of the original [[Cuba]]n tobaccos that emerged around the time of [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]].
* [[Dokha]] is a tobacco originally grown in [[Iran]], mixed with leaves, bark, and herbs for smoking in a ''[[midwakh]]''.
* [[Turkish tobacco]] is a sun-cured, highly aromatic, small-leafed variety (''[[Nicotiana tabacum]]'') grown in [[Turkey]], [[Greece]], [[Bulgaria]], and [[North Macedonia]]. Originally grown in regions historically part of the [[Ottoman Empire]], it is also known as "oriental". Many of the early brands of cigarettes were made mostly or entirely of Turkish tobacco; today, its main use is in blends of pipe and especially cigarette tobacco (a typical American cigarette is a blend of bright Virginia, burley, and Turkish).
* [[Perique]] was developed in 1824 through the technique of pressure-fermentation of local tobacco by a farmer, Pierre Chenet. Considered the [[truffle]] of [[smoking pipe (tobacco)|pipe]] tobaccos, it is used as a component in many blended pipe tobaccos, but is too strong to be smoked pure. At one time, the freshly moist Perique was also chewed, but none is now sold for this purpose. It is typically blended with pure Virginia to lend spice, strength, and coolness to the blend.
* [[Types of tobacco#Shade tobacco|Shade tobacco]] is cultivated in [[Connecticut]] and [[Massachusetts]]. Early Connecticut [[colonist]]s acquired from the Native Americans the habit of smoking tobacco in pipes, and began cultivating the plant commercially, though the [[Puritans]] referred to it as the "evil weed". The [[Connecticut shade tobacco|Connecticut shade]] industry has weathered some major [[Disaster|catastrophes]], including a devastating [[hail]]storm in 1929, and an epidemic of brown spot fungus in 2000, but is now in danger of disappearing altogether, given the increase in the value of land.
* [[Types of tobacco#White Burley|White burley]] air-cured leaf was found to be more mild than other types of tobacco. In 1865, George Webb of [[Brown County, Ohio]] planted red [[Burley (tobacco)|burley]] seeds he had purchased, and found a few of the seedlings had a whitish, sickly look, which became white burley.
* [[Types of tobacco#Wild Tobacco|Wild tobacco]] is native to the southwestern United States, [[Mexico]], and parts of [[South America]]. Its botanical name is ''Nicotiana rustica''.

===Cultivation===
{{Main|Cultivation of tobacco}}
[[File:Nicotiana Tobacco Plants 1909px.jpg|thumb|upright|Tobacco plants growing in a field in [[Intercourse, Pennsylvania|Intercourse]], [[Pennsylvania]].]]

Tobacco is cultivated similarly to other agricultural products. [[Seed]]s were at first quickly scattered onto the soil. However, young plants came under increasing attack from [[flea beetle]]s (''Epitrix cucumeris'' or ''E. pubescens''), which caused destruction of half the tobacco crops in United States in 1876. By 1890, successful experiments were conducted that placed the plant in a frame covered by thin cotton fabric. Today, tobacco seeds are sown in [[cold frame]]s or hotbeds, as their [[germination]] is activated by light.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Garner |first1=W. W. |title=Tobacco Culture |journal=Farmers' Bulletin |date=February 27, 1914 |issue=571 |pages=3–4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_MX4JEAVPi4C&pg=RA21-PA1 |access-date=22 March 2020 |publisher=United States Department of Agriculture}}</ref> In the United States, tobacco is often fertilized with the mineral [[apatite]], which partially starves the plant of [[Biological role of nitrogen|nitrogen]], to produce a more desired flavor.

After the plants are about {{convert| 8| inch|cm}}  tall, they are transplanted into the fields. Farmers used to have to wait for rainy weather to plant. A hole is created in the tilled earth with a tobacco peg, either a curved wooden tool or deer antler. After making two holes to the right and left, the planter would move forward two feet, select plants from his/her bag, and repeat. Various mechanical tobacco planters like Bemis, New Idea Setter, and New Holland Transplanter were invented in the late 19th and 20th centuries to automate the process: making the hole, watering it, guiding the plant in — all in one motion.<ref>{{cite book|last1=van Willigen|first1=John|last2=Eastwood|first2=Susan|title=Tobacco Culture: Farming Kentucky's Burley Belt|date=2015|publisher=University Press of Kentucky|isbn=9780813148083|page=91|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JIkfBgAAQBAJ|access-date=February 2, 2018}}</ref>

Tobacco is cultivated annually, and can be [[Harvest|harvested]] in several ways. In the oldest method, still used today, the entire plant is harvested at once by cutting off the stalk at the ground with a tobacco knife; it is then speared onto sticks, four to six plants a stick, and hung in a curing barn. In the 19th century, bright tobacco began to be harvested by pulling individual leaves off the stalk as they ripened. The leaves ripen from the ground upwards, so a field of tobacco harvested in this manner entails the serial harvest of a number of "primings", beginning with the ''volado'' leaves near the ground, working to the ''seco'' leaves in the middle of the plant, and finishing with the potent ''[[ligero]]'' leaves at the top. Before harvesting, the crop must be ''topped'' when the pink flowers develop. Topping always refers to the removal of the tobacco flower before the leaves are systematically harvested. As the industrial revolution took hold, the harvesting wagons which were used to transport leaves were equipped with man-powered stringers, an apparatus that used twine to attach leaves to a pole. In modern times, large fields are harvested mechanically, although topping the flower and in some cases the plucking of immature leaves is still done by hand.

In the U.S., [[North Carolina]] and [[Kentucky]] are the leaders in tobacco production, followed by [[Tennessee]], [[Virginia]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[South Carolina]] and [[Pennsylvania]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://quickstats.nass.usda.gov/|title=USDA/NASS QuickStats Ad-hoc Query Tool|website=quickstats.nass.usda.gov|date=2019|access-date=July 1, 2020}}</ref>

===Curing===
{{Main|Curing of tobacco}}
[[File:Tobacco barn.JPG|thumb|Tobacco barn in [[Simsbury, Connecticut]] used for air curing of shade tobacco]]
[[File:Tobacco drying iran.jpg|thumb|Sun-cured tobacco, [[Bastam]], [[Iran]]]]

Curing and subsequent aging allow for the slow [[oxidation]] and degradation of [[carotenoid]]s in tobacco leaf. This produces certain compounds in the tobacco leaves and gives a sweet hay, [[tea]], [[rose oil]], or fruity aromatic flavor that contributes to the "smoothness" of the smoke. Starch is converted to sugar, which [[glycation|glycates]] protein, and is oxidized into [[advanced glycation endproduct]]s (AGEs), a [[caramelization]] process that also adds flavor. Inhalation of these AGEs in tobacco smoke contributes to [[atherosclerosis]] and [[cancer]].<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Cerami C, Founds H, Nicholl I, Mitsuhashi T, Giordano D, Vanpatten S, Lee A, Al-Abed Y, Vlassara H, Bucala R, Cerami A |title=Tobacco smoke is a source of toxic reactive glycation products|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|volume=94|issue=25|year=1997|pages=13915–20|doi=10.1073/pnas.94.25.13915|pmid=9391127|pmc=28407|bibcode=1997PNAS...9413915C}}</ref> Levels of AGEs are dependent on the curing method used.

Tobacco can be cured through several methods, including:

* '''[[Curing of tobacco#Air|Air-cured]]''' tobacco is hung in well-ventilated barns and allowed to dry over a period of four to eight weeks. Air-cured tobacco is low in sugar, which gives the tobacco smoke a light, mild flavor, and high in nicotine. Cigar and burley tobaccos are 'dark' air-cured.<ref>"tobacco curing." The Hutchinson Unabridged Encyclopedia with Atlas and Weather guide. Abington: Helicon, 2010. Credo Reference. Web. September 26, 2012.</ref>
* '''[[Curing of tobacco#Fire|Fire-cured]]''' tobacco is hung in large barns where fires of hardwoods are kept on continuous or intermittent low smoulder, and takes between three days and ten weeks, depending on the process and the tobacco. Fire curing produces a tobacco low in sugar and high in nicotine. Pipe tobacco, chewing tobacco, and snuff are fire-cured.
* '''[[Curing of tobacco#Flue|Flue-cured]]''' tobacco was originally strung onto tobacco sticks, which were hung from tier poles in curing barns (Aus: [[kiln]]s, also traditionally called 'oasts'). These barns have flues run from externally fed fire boxes, heat-curing the tobacco without exposing it to smoke, slowly raising the temperature over the course of the curing. The process generally takes about a week. This method produces cigarette tobacco that is high in sugar and has medium to high levels of nicotine. Most cigarettes incorporate flue-cured tobacco, which produces a milder, more inhalable smoke. It is estimated that 1 tree is cut to flue-cure every 300 cigarettes, resulting in serious environmental consequences.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Tobacco and its environmental impact: an overview|others=World Health Organization|isbn=9789241512497|location=[Geneva, Switzerland?]|oclc=988541317|last1 = Organization|first1 = World Health|year = 2017}}</ref>
* '''[[Curing of tobacco#Sun|Sun-cured]]''' tobacco dries uncovered in the sun. This method is used in Turkey, Greece, and other Mediterranean countries to produce oriental tobacco. Sun-cured tobacco is low in sugar and nicotine and is used in cigarettes.

Some tobaccos go through a second stage of curing, known as ''[[Fermentation (food)|fermenting]]'' or ''sweating''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Tobacco Leaf Harvesting, Curing, and Fermenting|url=https://www.leafonly.com/tobacco-harvesting-curing-fermenting.php|website=Leaf Only|access-date=April 20, 2017}}</ref> [[Cavendish Tobacco|Cavendish]] undergoes fermentation pressed in a ''casing'' solution containing sugar and/or flavoring.<ref>{{cite web|title=Pipe Tobacco|url=http://www.tobacconistuniversity.org/tobacco-college/pipe-special-types2.asp |access-date=April 20, 2017 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017001708/http://www.tobacconistuniversity.org/tobacco-college/pipe-special-types2.asp |archive-date=October 17, 2013 }}</ref>

Every year, about 6.7 million tons of tobacco are produced throughout the world. The top producers of tobacco are China (39.6%), India (8.3%), Brazil (7.0%) and the United States (4.6%).<ref>US Census Bureau-Foreign Trade Statistics, (Washington DC; 2005)</ref>

=====China=====
Around the peak of global tobacco production, 20 million rural Chinese households were producing tobacco on 2.1 million hectares of land.<ref name="ReferenceA">Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. "Issues in the Global Tobacco Economy."</ref> While it is the major crop for millions of Chinese farmers, growing tobacco is not as profitable as cotton or sugarcane, because the Chinese government sets the market price. While this price is guaranteed, it is lower than the natural market price, because of the lack of market risk. To further control tobacco in their borders, China founded a [[State Tobacco Monopoly Administration]] (STMA) in 1982. The STMA controls tobacco production, marketing, imports, and exports, and contributes 12% to the nation's national income.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.cn/english/2005-10/03/content_74295.htm |title=People's Republic of China. "''State Tobacco Monopoly Administration'' |publisher=Gov.cn |date=September 15, 2005 |access-date=October 3, 2013}}</ref> As noted above, despite the income generated for the state by profits from state-owned tobacco companies and the taxes paid by companies and retailers, China's government has acted to reduce tobacco use.<ref>USC U.S.-China Institute, "Talking Points, February 3–17, 2010: http://china.usc.edu/ShowArticle.aspx?articleID=1992</ref>

=====India=====
[[India]]'s Tobacco Board is headquartered in [[Guntur]] in the state of [[Andhra Pradesh]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tobaccoboard.com/ |title=Tobacco Board, Guntur |publisher=Tobaccoboard.com |access-date=April 21, 2014}}</ref> India has 96,865 registered tobacco farmers<ref name="Shoba 2002">Shoba, John and Shailesh Vaite. Tobacco and Poverty: Observations from India and Bangladesh. Canada, 2002.</ref> and many more who are not registered. In 2010, 3,120 tobacco product manufacturing facilities were operating in all of India.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://india.anythingresearch.com/Tobacco-Product-Manufacturing.html|title=Tobacco Manufacturing in India}}</ref> Around 0.25% of India's cultivated land is used for tobacco production.<ref>3.Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. "Issues in the Global Tobacco Economy."</ref>

Since 1947, the [[Indian government]] has supported growth in the tobacco industry. India has seven tobacco research centers, located in [[Tamil Nadu]], [[Andhra Pradesh]], [[Punjab, India|Punjab]], [[Bihar]], [[Mysore]], and [[West Bengal]] houses the core research institute.

=====Brazil=====
In Brazil, around 135,000 family farmers cite tobacco production as their main economic activity.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> Tobacco has never exceeded 0.7% of the country's total cultivated area.<ref name="ReferenceB">{{cite book|last1=International Tobacco Growers' Association|title=Tobacco farming: sustainable alternatives? Volume 2|date=n.d.|publisher=ITGA|location=East Sussex|isbn=978-1872854021|url=http://www.tobaccoleaf.org/UserFiles/file/Why_Grow_Tobacco/tobacco_farming.pdf}}</ref> In the southern regions of Brazil, Virginia, and Amarelinho, flue-cured tobacco, as well as burley and Galpão Comum air-cured tobacco, are produced. These types of tobacco are used for cigarettes. In the northeast, darker, air- and sun-cured tobacco is grown. These types of tobacco are used for cigars, twists, and dark cigarettes.<ref name="ReferenceB"/>
Brazil's government has made attempts to reduce the production of tobacco but has not had a successful systematic antitobacco farming initiative. Brazil's government, however, provides small loans for family farms, including those that grow tobacco, through the ''Programa Nacional de Fortalecimento da Agricultura Familiar''.<ref>High Level Commission on Legal Empowerment of the Poor. "Report from South America." 2006.</ref>

===Problems in production===

====Child labor====
{{main|Child labor}}
The International Labour Office reported that the most child-laborers work in agriculture, which is one of the most hazardous types of work.<ref name="ReferenceC">ILO. International Hazard Datasheets on Occupations: Field Crop Worker</ref>{{Failed verification|date=July 2017|talk=Child labor and failed verification}} The tobacco industry houses some of these working children. Use of children is widespread on farms in Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Malawi, and Zimbabwe.<ref>UNICEF, The State of the World's Children 1997 (Oxford, 1997); US Department of Agriculture By the Sweat and Toil of Children Volume II: The Use of Child Labor in US Agricultural Imports & Forced and Bonded Child Labor (Washington, 1995); ILO Bitter Harvest: Child Labour in Agriculture (Geneva, 1997); ILO Child Labour on Commercial Agriculture in Africa (Geneva 1997)</ref> While some of these children work with their families on small, family-owned farms, others work on large plantations.
In late 2009, reports were released by the London-based human-rights group [[Plan International]], claiming that child labor was common on Malawi (producer of 1.8% of the world's tobacco<ref name="United Nations 2010"/>) tobacco farms. The organization interviewed 44 teens, who worked full-time on farms during the 2007-8 growing season. The child-laborers complained of low pay and long hours, as well as physical and sexual abuse by their supervisors.<ref>Plan International. ''Malawi Child Tobacco Pickers' '50-a-day habit'' http://plan-international.org/about-plan/resources/media-centre/press-releases/malawi-child-tobacco-pickers-50-a-day-habit/?searchterm=tobacco</ref> They also reported suffering from [[Green tobacco sickness]], a form of nicotine poisoning. When wet leaves are handled, nicotine from the leaves gets absorbed in the skin and causes nausea, vomiting, and dizziness. Children were exposed to levels of nicotine equivalent to smoking 50 cigarettes, just through direct contact with tobacco leaves. This level of nicotine in children can permanently alter brain structure and function.<ref name="ReferenceC"/>{{Failed verification|date=July 2017|talk=Child labor and failed verification}}

====Economy====
[[File:MRO Cuba Harvest 01.jpg|thumb|Tobacco harvesting, [[Viñales Valley]], Cuba]]
Major tobacco companies have encouraged global tobacco production. [[Altria Group|Philip Morris]], [[British American Tobacco]], and [[Japan Tobacco]] each own or lease tobacco-manufacturing facilities in at least 50 countries and buy crude tobacco leaf from at least 12 more countries.<ref>"International Cigarette Manufacturers," Tobacco Reporter, March 2001</ref> This encouragement, along with government subsidies, has led to a glut in the tobacco market. This surplus has resulted in lower prices, which are devastating to small-scale tobacco farmers. According to the World Bank, between 1985 and 2000, the inflation-adjusted price of tobacco dropped 37%.<ref>{{cite web |title=Golden Leaf, Barren Harvest: The Costs of Tobacco Farming |url=http://www.ash.org.uk/files/documents/ASH_330.pdf |author=The Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids |date=November 2001 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130406112907/http://www.ash.org.uk/files/documents/ASH_330.pdf |archive-date=April 6, 2013 }}</ref> Tobacco is the most widely [[smuggling|smuggled]] legal product.<ref name=ICLJTU>{{cite news|title=Tobacco Underground|url=http://www.icij.org/project/tobacco-underground|access-date=November 26, 2012|newspaper=The International Consortium of Investigative Journalists}}</ref>

====Environment====
Tobacco production requires the use of large amounts of [[pesticide]]s. Tobacco companies recommend up to 16 separate applications of pesticides just in the period between planting the seeds in greenhouses and transplanting the young plants to the field.<ref name="Taylor, Peter 1994">{{cite book|last=Taylor|first=Peter|title=Smoke Ring: The Politics of Tobacco|publisher=Panos Briefing Paper|location=London|date=September 1994}}</ref> Pesticide use has been worsened by the desire to produce larger crops in less time because of the decreasing market value of tobacco. Pesticides often harm tobacco farmers because they are unaware of the health effects and the proper safety protocol for working with pesticides. These pesticides, as well as fertilizers, end up in the soil, waterways, and the food chain.<ref>{{cite book|title=FAO Yearbook, Production, Volume 48|year=1995}}</ref> Coupled with child labor, pesticides pose an even greater threat. Early exposure to pesticides may increase a child's lifelong cancer risk, as well as harm his or her nervous and immune systems.<ref>{{cite book|title=Pesticides in the Diets of Infants and Children|year=1995|publisher=National Academy Press|author=National Research Council}}</ref>

As with all crops, tobacco crops extract nutrients (such as [[phosphorus]], [[nitrogen]], and [[potassium]]) from soil, decreasing its fertility.<ref name=wwf.panda>{{cite web|title=Tobacco Free Initiative: Environmental issues|url=https://www.who.int/tobacco/research/economics/rationale/environment/en/|author=World Health Organization}}</ref>

Furthermore, the wood used to cure tobacco in some places leads to deforestation. While some big tobacco producers such as China and the United States have access to petroleum, coal, and natural gas, which can be used as alternatives to wood, most developing countries still rely on wood in the curing process.<ref name="wwf.panda"/> Brazil alone uses the wood of 60 million trees per year for curing, packaging, and rolling cigarettes.<ref name="Taylor, Peter 1994"/>

In 2017 WHO released a study on the environmental effects of tobacco.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://www.who.int/tobacco/publications/environmental-impact-overview/en/ |title=Tobacco and its environmental impact: an overview |work=World Health Organization |date=2017 |isbn=978-92-4-151249-7 |last1=Organization |first1=World Health }}</ref>

===Research===
Several tobacco plants have been used as [[model organism]]s in [[genetics]]. [[Tobacco BY-2 cells]], derived from ''N. tabacum'' [[cultivar]] 'Bright Yellow-2', are among the most important research tools in plant [[cell biology|cytology]].<ref>{{cite journal | author = Ganapathi TR |display-authors=etal | year = 2004 | title = Tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.) – A model system for tissue culture interventions and genetic engineering | url = http://nopr.niscair.res.in/bitstream/123456789/7722/1/IJBT%203(2)%20171-184.pdf | journal = Indian Journal of Biotechnology | volume = 3 | pages = 171–184 }}</ref> Tobacco has played a pioneering role in [[Callus (cell biology)|callus]] culture research and the elucidation of the mechanism by which [[kinetin]] works, laying the groundwork for modern agricultural [[biotechnology]].

===Genetic modification===
Because of its importance as a research tool, transgenic tobacco was the first GM crop to be tested in field trials, in the United States and France in 1986; China became the first country in the world to approve commercial planting of a GM crop in 1993, which was tobacco.<ref name="James 1996">{{cite web|last=James|first=Clive|title=Global Review of the Field Testing and Commercialization of Transgenic Plants: 1986 to 1995|url=http://www.isaaa.org/kc/Publications/pdfs/isaaabriefs/Briefs%201.pdf|publisher=The International Service for the Acquisition of Agri-biotech Applications|access-date=July 17, 2010|year=1996}}</ref>

====Field trials====
Many varieties of transgenic tobacco have been intensively tested in field trials. Agronomic traits such as resistance to pathogens (viruses, particularly to the tobacco mosaic virus (TMV); fungi; bacteria and nematodes); weed management via herbicide tolerance; resistance against insect pests; resistance to drought and cold; and production of useful products such as pharmaceuticals; and use of GM plants for [[bioremediation]], have all been tested in over 400 field trials using tobacco.<ref name=GMOCompass>{{cite web |url=http://www.gmo-compass.org/eng/database/plants/304.tobacco.html |title=Tobacco |publisher=GMO Compass |access-date=October 3, 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002090217/http://www.gmo-compass.org/eng/database/plants/304.tobacco.html |archive-date=October 2, 2013 }}</ref>

==Consumption==
{{Further|Tobacco products}}

Tobacco is consumed in many forms and through a number of different methods. Some examples are:

* '''[[Beedi]]''' are thin, often flavoured cigarettes from India made of tobacco wrapped in a [[Diospyros melanoxylon|tendu]] leaf, and secured with coloured thread at one end.
* '''[[Chewing tobacco]]''' is the oldest way of consuming tobacco leaves. It is consumed orally, in two forms: through sweetened strands ("chew" or "chaw"), or in a shredded form ("dip"). When consuming the long, sweetened strands, the tobacco is lightly chewed and compacted into a ball. When consuming the shredded tobacco, small amounts are placed at the bottom lip, between the gum and the teeth, where it is gently compacted, thus it can often be called dipping tobacco. Both methods stimulate the salivary glands, which led to the development of the [[spittoon]].
* '''[[Cigar]]s''' are tightly rolled bundles of dried and fermented tobacco, which are ignited so their smoke may be drawn into the smokers' mouths.
* '''[[Cigarette]]s''' are a product consumed through inhalation of smoke and manufactured from cured and finely cut tobacco leaves and reconstituted tobacco, often combined with other additives, then rolled into a paper cylinder.
* '''[[Creamy snuff]]''' is tobacco paste, consisting of tobacco, clove oil, glycerin, spearmint, menthol, and camphor, and sold in a toothpaste tube. It is marketed mainly to women in India, and is known by the brand names Ipco (made by Asha Industries), Denobac, Tona, and Ganesh. It is locally known as ''mishri'' in some parts of Maharashtra.
* '''[[Dipping tobacco]]s''' are a form of [[smokeless tobacco]]. Dip is occasionally referred to as "chew", and because of this, it is commonly confused with [[chewing tobacco]], which encompasses a wider range of products. A small clump of dip is 'pinched' out of the tin and placed between the lower or upper lip and gums. Some brands, as with snus, are portioned in small, porous pouches for less mess.
* '''[[Gutka]]''' is a preparation of crushed betel nut, tobacco, and sweet or savory flavorings. It is manufactured in India and exported to a few other countries. A mild stimulant, it is sold across India in small, individual-sized packets.
* '''[[Heat-not-burn product]]s''' heat rather than burn tobacco to generate an aerosol that contains nicotine.
* '''[[Dokha]]''' is a middle eastern tobacco with high nicotine levels grown in parts of Oman and Hatta, which is smoked through a thin pipe called a medwakh. It is a form of tobacco which is dried up and ground and contains little to no additives excluding spices, fruits, or flowers to enhance smell and flavor.
* '''[[Hookah]]''' is a single- or multistemmed (often glass-based) water pipe for smoking. Hookahs were first used in India and Persia;<ref>American Lung Association. February 2007 [http://www.lungusa2.org/embargo/slati/Trendalert_Waterpipes.pdf An Emerging Deadly Trend: Waterpipe Tobacco Use]</ref> the hookah has gained immense popularity, especially in the Middle East. A hookah operates by water filtration and indirect heat. It can be used for smoking herbal fruits or [[moassel]], a mixture of tobacco, flavouring, and [[honey]] or [[glycerin]].
* '''[[Kreteks]]''' are cigarettes made with a complex blend of tobacco, cloves, and a flavoring "sauce". They were first introduced in the 1880s in Kudus, Java, to deliver the medicinal [[eugenol]] of cloves to the lungs.
* '''[[Roll-your-own]]''', often called 'rollies' or 'roll-ups', are relatively popular in some European countries. These are prepared from loose tobacco, cigarette papers, and filters all bought separately. They are usually cheaper to make.
* '''[[Snuff (tobacco)|Snuff]]''' is a ground smokeless tobacco product, inhaled or "snuffed" through the nose. If referring specifically to the orally consumed moist snuff, see [[dipping tobacco]].
* '''[[Snus]]''' is a steam-pasteurized moist powdered tobacco product that is not fermented, and induces minimal salivation. It is consumed by placing it (loose or in little pouches) against the upper gums for an extended period of time. It is somewhat similar to dipping tobacco but does not require spitting and is significantly lower in [[Tobacco-specific nitrosamines|TSNA]]s.
* '''Tobacco edibles''', often in the form of an infusion or a spice, have gained popularity in recent years.
* '''[[Tobacco pipe|Tobacco pipes]]''' typically consist of a small chamber (the bowl) for the combustion of the tobacco to be smoked and a thin stem (shank) that ends in a mouthpiece (the bit). Shredded pieces of tobacco are placed in the chamber and ignited.
* '''[[Tobacco smoke enema]]s''' were employed by the [[indigenous peoples of the Americas#North America|indigenous peoples of North America]] to stimulate respiration,, injecting the smoke with a rectal tube.<ref>{{Citation |last1 = Hurt |first1 = Raymond |last2 = Barry |first2 = J.

==Impact==

===Social===
Smoking in public was, for a long time, reserved for men, and when done by women was sometimes associated with [[promiscuity]]; in Japan, during the [[Edo period]], prostitutes and their clients often approached one another under the guise of offering a smoke. The same was true in 19th-century Europe.<ref name="Screech-Smoke">{{cite book |isbn=9781861892003 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mM5bYb_uVcwC&pg=PA92 |pages=92–99 |first=Timon |last=Screech |title = Smoke: A Global History of Smoking|year = 2004}}</ref>

{{quotation|In the judgment of The Allegheny Wesleyan Methodist Connection (Original Allegheny Conference), the use of tobacco is a great evil, unbecoming a Christian, a waste of the Lord’s money, and a defilement of the body, which should be the temple of the Holy Ghost. We do, therefore, most earnestly require our members to refrain from its cultivation, manufacture, and sale, and to abstain from its use in all forms, for Jesus’ sake. We will not receive as members into our churches nor will we ordain or license to preach or to exhort, persons who use, cultivate, manufacture, or sell tobacco. Using tobacco by a member of a church or of the Conference after being received from this date (June 28, 1927) is a violation
of the law of the church, and the offending party should be dealt with according to the judiciary rules.<ref name="AWMC2014">{{cite book|title=The Discipline of the Allegheny Wesleyan Methodist Connection (Original Allegheny Conference)|year=2014|publisher=[[Allegheny Wesleyan Methodist Connection]]|location=[[Salem, Ohio|Salem]]|language=en|page=44}}</ref>}}

===Harmful effects of tobacco and smoking===
{{Main|Health effects of tobacco}}
{{See also|List of additives in cigarettes}}
Tobacco smoking endangers health due to the inhalation of poisonous chemicals in tobacco smoke, such as [[carbon monoxide]], [[cyanide]], and [[carcinogens]], which have been proven to cause heart and lung diseases and cancer.
Thousands of different substances in cigarette smoke, including [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons]] (such as [[benzopyrene]]), [[formaldehyde]], [[cadmium]], [[nickel]], [[arsenic]], [[tobacco-specific nitrosamines]], and [[phenols]] contribute to the harmful effects of smoking.<ref name="tobaccocontrol.bmj.com">{{cite journal|author=Proctor Robert N|year=2012|title=The history of the discovery of the cigarette-lung cancer link: evidentiary traditions, corporate denial, global toll|url=http://tobaccocontrol.bmj.com/content/21/2/87.full.pdf|journal=Tobacco Control|volume=21|issue=2|pages=87–91|doi=10.1136/tobaccocontrol-2011-050338|pmid=22345227|s2cid=2734836}}</ref>

The harms caused by inhalation of tobacco smoke include diseases of the [[heart]] and [[lung]]s, with smoking being a major risk factor for [[myocardial infarction|heart attacks]], [[stroke]]s, [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]] (emphysema), and [[cancer]] (particularly cancers of the [[Lung cancer|lungs]], [[Cancer of the larynx|larynx, mouth]], and [[pancreatic cancers|pancreas]]). Cancer is caused by inhaling carcinogenic substances in tobacco smoke.

Inhaling secondhand tobacco smoke (which has been exhaled by a smoker) can cause lung cancer in nonsmoking adults. In the United States, about 3,000 adults die each year due to lung cancer from secondhand smoke exposure. Heart disease caused by secondhand smoke kills around 46,000 nonsmokers every year.<ref>[http://betobaccofree.hhs.gov/health-effects/secondhand-smoke/index.html Secondhand Smoke] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140920231625/http://betobaccofree.hhs.gov/health-effects/secondhand-smoke/index.html |date=September 20, 2014 }} by BeTobaccoFree.gov</ref>

===Advertising===
{{Main|Tobacco advertising}}

The tobacco industry advertises its products through a variety of media, including sponsorship, particularly of sporting events. Because of the health risks of these products, this is now one of the most highly regulated forms of marketing. Some or all forms of tobacco advertising are banned in many countries.
