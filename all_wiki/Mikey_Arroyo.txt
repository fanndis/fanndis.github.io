In August 2009, [[Vera Files]], a group of veteran Filipino journalists, reported that Arroyo "''has failed to declare in his Statement of Assets, Liabilities and Networth (SALN) for the last two years a $1.32 million or P63.7 million beachfront property in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] in [[California]], which he bought and then transferred to his wife Angela in 2006''." The house is located in Beach Park Blvd in [[Foster City]] in [[San Mateo County]]. He defended himself by saying that the money he used in acquiring these properties came from cash gifts he received for his wedding as well as from campaign contributions.<ref>{{cite news |work=Philippine Daily Inquirer|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/nation/view/20090903-223295/Mikey-Arroyo-under-fire-on-YouTube |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-04-27 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100724211045/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net//inquirerheadlines//nation//view//20090903-223295//Mikey-Arroyo-under-fire-on-YouTube |archivedate=2010-07-24 }}</ref>

Nearly two years later, the [[Bureau of Internal Revenue (Philippines)|Bureau of Internal Revenue]] filed [[tax evasion]] charges against Arroyo and his wife Angela for not filing income tax returns for the years 2005, 2008 and 2009. BIR Chief Kim Jacinto-Henares mentioned that based on the documents her agency had obtained, the couple owes the government P73.85 million in unpaid taxes. Arroyo lawyer Ruy Rondain questioned the timing of the filing of these charges.<ref>http://www.philstar.com/Article.aspx?articleId=673941&publicationSubCategoryId=63{{Dead link|date=April 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

On July 10, 2020, Arroyo is among the 70 representatives who voted "yes" to [[ABS-CBN franchise renewal controversy|reject the franchise renewal]] of [[ABS-CBN]], the Philippine's largest television network.<ref>{{cite news|title=List of lawmakers who voted for and against ABS-CBN franchise renewal |work=[[Philippine Star|Philstar.com]] |url=https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2020/07/10/2027049/list-lawmakers-who-voted-and-against-abs-cbn-franchise-renewal |date=July 10, 2020 |accessdate=July 22, 2020 |last=Perez-Rubio |first=Bella}}</ref> Two months later, he proposed the suggestion to postpone the [[2022 Philippine presidential election|2022 Philippine elections]] due to the [[COVID-19 pandemic in the Philippines|COVID-19 pandemic]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1339789/mikey-arroyo-raises-idea-of-postponing-2022-polls-due-to-pandemic|title=Mikey Arroyo raises idea of postponing 2022 polls due to pandemic|work=Philippine Daily Inquirer|date=2020-09-24}}</ref>
