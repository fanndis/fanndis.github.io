'''Monica Samille Lewinsky''' (born July 23, 1973)<ref name="cnn-whois"/> is an American activist, television personality, fashion designer, and former [[White House]] intern. [[President of the United States|President]] [[Bill Clinton]] admitted to having had an affair with Lewinsky while she worked at the [[White House]] in 1995–1996. The affair and its repercussions (which included [[impeachment of Bill Clinton|Clinton's impeachment]]) became known later as the [[Clinton–Lewinsky scandal]].

As a result of the public coverage of the political scandal, Lewinsky gained international celebrity status. She subsequently engaged in a variety of ventures that included designing a line of handbags under her name, being an advertising spokesperson for a [[Dieting|diet]] plan, and working as a television personality. Lewinsky later decided to leave the public spotlight to pursue a master's degree in [[psychology]] in [[London]]. In 2014, she returned to public view as a social activist speaking out against [[cyberbullying]].

Lewinsky stated that she had nine sexual encounters in the [[Oval Office]] with President [[Bill Clinton]] between November 1995 and March 1997. According to her testimony, these involved [[fellatio]] and other sexual acts, but not sexual intercourse.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/politics/2008-03-19-852575883_x.htm |title=Lewinsky and the first lady |date=March 19, 2008 |agency=Associated Press |access-date=January 19, 2010 |work=USA Today |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100412161707/http://www.usatoday.com/news/politics/2008-03-19-852575883_x.htm |archive-date=April 12, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

Clinton had previously been confronted with allegations of sexual misconduct during his time as Governor of Arkansas. Former Arkansas state employee [[Paula Jones]] filed a civil lawsuit against him alleging that he had sexually harassed her. Lewinsky's name surfaced during the discovery phase of Jones' case, when Jones' lawyers sought to show a pattern of behavior by Clinton which involved inappropriate sexual relationships with other government employees.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Xq9fAAAAIBAJ&sjid=mOYFAAAAIBAJ&pg=3866,13572 |title=Paula Jones' lawyers want Lewinsky evidence |agency=[[Associated Press]] |newspaper=[[Gettysburg Times]] |date=April 1, 1998 |page=A3}}</ref>

In April 1996, Lewinsky's superiors transferred her from the White House to the Pentagon because they felt that she was spending too much time around Clinton.<ref name="WashpoProfile" /> At the Pentagon, she worked as an assistant to chief Pentagon spokesman [[Kenneth Bacon]].<ref name="WashpoProfile" /> Lewinsky told co-worker [[Linda Tripp]] about her relationship with Clinton, and Tripp began secretly recording their telephone conversations beginning in September 1997.

Tripp gave the tapes to Independent Counsel [[Kenneth Starr]], adding to his on-going investigation into the [[Whitewater (controversy)|Whitewater controversy]]. Starr then broadened his investigation beyond the Arkansas land use deal to include Lewinsky, Clinton, and others for possible perjury and subornation of perjury in the Jones case. Tripp reported the taped conversations to literary agent [[Lucianne Goldberg]]. She also convinced Lewinsky to save the gifts that Clinton had given her during their relationship and not to dry clean a blue dress that was stained with Clinton's semen. Under oath, Clinton denied having had "a sexual affair", "sexual relations", or "a sexual relationship" with Lewinsky.<ref name="starr">[http://icreport.access.gpo.gov/report/6narrit.htm#L1 Starr Report: ''Nature of President Clinton's Relationship with Monica Lewinsky''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20001203073600/http://icreport.access.gpo.gov/report/6narrit.htm |date=December 3, 2000 }} Retrieved December 18, 2006.</ref>

News of the Clinton–Lewinsky relationship broke in January 1998. On January 26, 1998, Clinton stated, "I did not have sexual relations with that woman, Miss Lewinsky" in a nationally televised White House news conference.<ref name="ls-nh" /> The matter instantly occupied the news media, and Lewinsky spent the next weeks hiding from public attention in her mother's residence at the [[Watergate complex]].<ref name="mworld" /> News of Lewinsky's affair with Andy Bleiler, her former high school drama instructor, also came to light, and he turned over to Starr various souvenirs, photographs, and documents that Lewinsky had sent him and his wife during the time that she was in the White House.<ref name="wapo-bleiler" /><ref name="cnn-know" />

In October 2017, Lewinsky tweeted the [[Me Too (hashtag)|#MeToo hashtag]] to indicate that she was a victim of sexual harassment and/or sexual assault, but did not provide details.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/10/18/monica-lewinsky-tweets-metoo.html|agency=[[Fox News]]|date=October 18, 2017|title=Monica Lewinsky tweets '#MeToo'}}</ref> She wrote an essay in the March 2018 issue of ''Vanity Fair'' in which she did not directly explain why she used the #MeToo hashtag in October. She did write that looking back at her relationship with Bill Clinton, although it was consensual, because he was 27 years older than her and in a position with a lot more power than she had, in her opinion the relationship constituted an "abuse of power" on Clinton's part. She added that she had been diagnosed with [[post-traumatic stress disorder]] due to the experiences involved after the relationship was disclosed.<ref name="vanityfairemergingfrom">{{cite news|last1=Lewinsky|first1=Monica|title=Emerging from "The House of Gaslight" in the age of #MeToo|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/02/monica-lewinsky-in-the-age-of-metoo|access-date=February 26, 2018|work=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]|date=March 2018|quote=To be blunt, I was diagnosed several years ago with post-traumatic stress disorder, mainly from the ordeal of having been publicly outed and ostracized back then.}}</ref> In May 2018, Lewinsky was disinvited from an event hosted by ''[[Town & Country (magazine)|Town & Country]]'' when Bill Clinton accepted an invitation to the event.<ref>{{cite news |last=Peck |first=Emily |first2=Maxwell |last2=Strachan |date=9 May 2018 |title=Town & Country Magazine Uninvited Monica Lewinsky From An Event Because Of Bill Clinton |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/monica-lewinsky-town-country-bill-clinton_us_5af34667e4b04d3b2c901b74 |work=Huffington Post |access-date=9 May 2018  }}</ref>

In September 2018, Lewinsky spoke at a conference in [[Jerusalem]]. Following her speech, she sat for a Q&A session with the host, journalist [[Yonit Levi]]. The first question Levi asked was whether Lewinsky thinks that Clinton owes her a private apology. Lewinsky refused to answer the question, and walked off the stage. She later tweeted that the question was posed in a pre-event meeting with Levi, and Lewinsky told her that such a question was off limits. A spokesman for the [[Israel Television News Company]], which hosted the conference and is Levi's employer, responded that Levi had kept all the agreements she made with Lewinsky and honored her requests.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2018/09/04/monica-lewinsky-walks-off-stage-jerusalem-conference-when-asked-about-bill-clinton/|newspaper=[[Washington Post]]|title= Monica Lewinsky walks off the stage at a Jerusalem conference when asked about Bill Clinton|date=September 4, 2018|first=Ruth| last=Eglash}}</ref>

In 2019, she was interviewed by [[John Oliver]] on his HBO show ''[[Last Week Tonight with John Oliver]]'', where they discussed the importance of solving the problem of [[public humiliation|public shaming]] and how her situation may have been different if social media had existed at the time that [[Clinton–Lewinsky scandal|the scandal]] broke in the late 1990s.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2019/03/john-oliver-blasts-jay-lenos-scolding-of-late-night-tv-for-lack-of-civility-1202577196/|title=John Oliver Blasts Jay Leno's Scolding Of Late-Night TV For Lack Of "Civility"|first1=Lisa |last1=de Moraes|date=March 18, 2019}}</ref>
