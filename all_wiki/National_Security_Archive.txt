The '''National Security Archive''' is a [[501(c)(3)]] [[non-governmental]], non-profit research and archival institution located on the campus of the [[George Washington University]] in Washington, D.C. Founded in 1985 to check rising government secrecy, the National Security Archive is an [[investigative journalism]] center, open government advocate, [[International relations|international affairs]] research institute, and the largest repository of declassified U.S. documents outside the federal government.<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite web |url=http://www2.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/nsa/the_archive.html |title=About the National Security Archive |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |website=The National Security Archive}}</ref> The National Security Archive has spurred the declassification of more than 10 million pages of government documents by being the leading non-profit user of the [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|U.S. Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)]], filing a total of more than 50,000 FOIA and declassification requests in its over 30 years of history.

==Organization history and accolades==
[[File:Nixon-Presley Meeting.gif|thumb|Of all the requests made each year to the U.S. National Archives, one item has been requested more than any other: the December 21, 1970, photograph of Elvis Presley and Richard M. Nixon shaking hands during Presley's visit to the White House.]]

Journalists and historians founded the National Security Archive in 1985 to enrich research and public debate about [[National Security of the United States|national security policy]].<ref name="autogenerated1"/> The National Security Archive continues to challenge national security secrecy by advocating for open government, utilizing the FOIA to compel the release of previously secret government documents, and analyzing and publishing its collections for the public.

As a prolific FOIA requester, the National Security Archive has obtained a host of seminal government documents, including: the most requested still image photograph at the U.S. National Archives – a December 21, 1970 picture of President [[Richard Nixon]]'s meeting with [[Elvis Presley]];<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www2.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/nsa/elvis/elnix.html |title=The Nixon-Presley Meeting |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |website=The National Security Archive }}</ref> the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]]'s "[[Family Jewels (Central Intelligence Agency)|Family Jewels]]" list that documents decades of the agency's illegal activities;<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www2.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB222/index.htm |title=The CIA's Family Jewels |author=Thomas Blanton |website=The National Security Archive}}</ref> the [[National Security Agency]]'s (NSA) description of its watch list of 1,600 Americans that included notable Americans such as civil rights leader [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], boxer [[Muhammad Ali]], and politicians [[Frank Church]] and [[Howard Baker]];<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nsarchive.wordpress.com/2013/09/25/foia-request-filed-for-national-security-agency-watch-list-that-included-threats-mlk-muhammad-ali-and-senator-church/ |title=FOIA Request Filed for National Security Agency Watch List that Included "Threats" MLK, Muhammad Ali, and Senator Church |author=Nate Jones |website=Unredacted |date=25 September 2013}}</ref> the first official CIA confirmation of [[Area 51]];<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www2.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB434/ |title=The Secret History of the U-2 — and Area 51 |author=Jeffrey T.

Journalismdegree.org includes Freedominfo.org on its list of Best Sites for Journalists in 2012. From 2003–2014 the Archive has received 54 citations from the University of Wisconsin's Internet Scout Report recognizing "the most valuable and authoritative resources online."

Knight Foundation]], the [[John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation]], and the [[Open Society Foundations]], for its $3 million yearly budget. The National Security Archive receives no government funding.<ref name="autogenerated1"/> Incorporated as an independent Washington, D.C. non-profit organization, the National Security Archive is recognized by the Internal Revenue Service as a tax-exempt public charity.

==Program areas==

The National Security Archive operates eight program areas, each with dedicated funding.

The National Security Archive regularly publishes Electronic Briefing Books <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/index.html |title=Electronic Briefing Books |publisher=.gwu.edu |accessdate=2015-04-30}}</ref> of newsworthy documents on major topics in international affairs on the Archive's website, which attracts more than 2 million visitors each year who download more than 13.3 gigabytes per day. There are currently over 500 briefing books available.

The National Security Archive also frequently posts about declassification and news on its blog, Unredacted.

==Lawsuits==

The National Security Archive has participated in over 50 Freedom of Information lawsuits against the U.S. government. The suits have forced the declassification of documents ranging from the Kennedy-Khrushchev letters during the Cuban Missile Crisis<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/01/07/world/the-cuba-missile-crisis-kennedy-left-a-loophole.html |title=The Cuba Missile Crisis: Kennedy Left a Loophole |author=Robert Pear |date=January 7, 1992 |website=The New York Times }}</ref> to the previously censored photographs of homecoming ceremonies <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB152/ |title=Return of the Fallen |publisher=.gwu.edu |accessdate=2015-04-30}}</ref> with flag-draped caskets for U.S. casualties of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.

In April 2017 the National Security Archive, with the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University and Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW), filed a FOIA lawsuit against the Department of Homeland Security for the release of the White House visitor logs in the federal District Court for the Southern District of New York on April 14, 2017. In 2017 the Archive was also a co-plaintiff with CREW in a federal suit<ref>{{cite web|url=https://s3.amazonaws.com/storage.citizensforethics.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/22122345/Complaint.pdf |title=CREW and National Security Archive v Trump |date=2017-06-22 |accessdate=2017-06-24}}</ref> against Donald Trump for alleged violations of the [[Presidential Records Act]].

The National Security Archive has also settled two seminal lawsuits regarding the preservation of White House emails. The original White House e-mail lawsuit<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/white_house_email/ |title=National Security Archive/White House E-Mail |publisher=.gwu.edu |accessdate=2015-04-30}}</ref> against presidents Ronald Reagan, George H. W. Bush, and Bill Clinton found that e-mail had to be treated as government records, consequently leading to the preservation of more than 30 million White House e-mail messages from the 1980s and 1990s. The [[Bush White House email controversy|second White House e-mail lawsuit]], filed in 2007 and settled in 2009,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.citizensforethics.org/pages/untold-story-of-the-bush-white-house-emails |title=Untold Story of the Bush White House Emails |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |website=Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington |url-status=dead |archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20140106205444/http%3A//www.citizensforethics.org/pages/untold%2Dstory%2Dof%2Dthe%2Dbush%2Dwhite%2Dhouse%2Demails |archive-date=2014-01-06 }}</ref> sought the recovery and preservation of more than 5 million White House e-mail messages that were deleted from White House computers between March 2003 and October 2005.

As of October 2018, the National Security Archive and Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington have a pending case<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.newsweek.com/trump-lawsuit-watchdog-group-records-signal-confide-twitter-destroy-628281|title=Trump Sued for Deleting Tweets and White House use of Encrypted Messaging Apps |last=Saul|first=Josh|date=June 22, 2017|website=Newsweek}}</ref> in the [[United States District Court for the District of Columbia]] against the [[Donald Trump|Donald J. Trump]] administration's use of messaging applications that can delete conversations or records of conversations which goes against the [[Presidential Records Act]]. The suit, ''[[CREW and National Security Archive v. Trump and EOP|Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington et al. v. Trump et al.]]'',  was filed on June 22, 2017. In March 2017, U.S. District Court Judge [[Christopher R. Cooper]] ruled that the act gives the president a "substantial degree of discretion" in deciding what should be preserved as a permanent records and it allows the president to destroy records that no longer have "administrative, historical, informational or evidentiary value." The case is currently under appeal.

==Audits==

Since 2002, the Archive has carried out annual FOIA audits that are designed after the California Sunshine Survey. These FOIA audits evaluate whether government agencies are in compliance with open-government laws. The surveys include:

==Rosemary Award==

Every year the National Security Archive nominates a government agency for the Rosemary Award for worst open government performance. The award is named after [[Richard Nixon|President Nixon's]] secretary, [[Rose Mary Woods]], who erased {{frac|18|1|2}} minutes of a crucial [[Watergate scandal|Watergate]] tape. Past "winners" include the Department of Justice, the Federal Chief Information Officer's Council, the FBI, the Department of the Treasury, the Air Force, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, the Secret Service, the White House and the CIA.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Federal Chief Information Officers (CIO) Council Wins Rosemary Award|url=http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/news/20150318/|publisher=National Security Archive}}</ref>

== Conferences ==

The Archive has organized, sponsored, or co-sponsored a dozen major conferences. These include the historic conferences held in Havana in 2002 and in Budapest in 1996 respectively. For the Havana conference, which took place during the 40th anniversary of the Cuban Missile Crisis, Cuban president [[Fidel Castro]] and former US secretary of defense [[Robert McNamara]] discussed newly declassified documents showing that US president John F. Kennedy, in meetings with Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev's son-in-law Adzhubei in January 1962, compared the US failure at the [[Bay of Pigs]] to the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Soviet invasion of Hungary in 1956]]. The Budapest conference of 1996, carried out by the Archive's "Openness in Russia and East Europe Project" in collaboration with [[Cold War International History Project]] and Russian and Eastern European partners, focused on the 1956 uprising was a featured subject at an international conference which the Archive, CWIHP, and the Zentrum für Zeithistorische Forschung organized in Potsdam on "The Crisis Year 1953 and the Cold War in Europe." Oxford University historian [[Timothy Garton Ash]] called the conference "not ordinary at all.... this dramatic confrontation of documents and memories, of written and oral history...."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www2.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/flashpoints/praise.html |title=Praise and Comments about the Openness Project |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |website=The National Security Archive}}</ref>

Other noteworthy conferences the National Security Archive took part in include a conference held in Hanoi in 1997, during which Defense Secretary Robert McNamara met with his Vietnamese counterpart, Gen. [[Võ Nguyên Giáp]], and a series of conferences on [[Iran–United States relations|U.S.-Iranian relations]].

In December 2016 the Archive, with the Carnegie Corporation, the Nuclear Threat Initiative, and the Carnegie Endowment, hosted a conference on the 25th anniversary of the Nunn-Lugar nuclear threat reduction legislation, which helped secure post-Soviet nuclear weapons. The conference, attended by Senators Sam Nunn and Richard Lugar as well as other Nunn-Lugar veterans including Russians, Kazakhs, and Americans, was held in the Kennedy Caucus Room of the U.S. Senate and discussed the future of mutual security and U.S.-Russian relations.
