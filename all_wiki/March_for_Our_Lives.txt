On March 21, [[NRATV]] host Grant Stinchfield stated that "March for Our Lives is backed by radicals with a history of violent threats, language and actions"; fact-checker [[PolitiFact]] has rated this statement as being "without merit" and "[[wiktionary:liar liar pants on fire|Pants on Fire]]" indicating that it is a "ridiculous claim".<ref>{{cite web|last1=Greenberg|first1=Jon|title=NRA says violent radicals are behind the March for Our Lives|url=http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/mar/23/national-rifle-association/nra-says-violent-radicals-are-behind-march-our-liv/|publisher=[[PolitiFact]]|access-date=March 25, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Holan|first1=Angie|title=The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter: PolitiFact's methodology for independent fact-checking|url=http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2018/feb/12/principles-truth-o-meter-politifacts-methodology-i/#Truth-O-Meter%20ratings|publisher=[[PolitiFact]]|access-date=March 25, 2018}}</ref>

While the march was occurring, the [[National Rifle Association|NRA]] posted a membership drive video on their Facebook page, declaring that the "protests aren't spontaneous. Gun-hating billionaires and Hollywood elites are manipulating and exploiting children as part of their plan to DESTROY the [[Second Amendment to the United States Constitution|Second Amendment]]". Another video dubbed "A March for Their Lies" was uploaded to [[YouTube]] featuring [[Colion Noir]], in which he described the planned rally as a "carnival of a march". Noir also said in the video that there is an "agenda that's a million times bigger than the guns".<ref>{{cite web|last1=Griggs|first1=Brandon|title=Here's what the NRA had to say today about the March for Our Lives|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2018/03/24/us/nra-march-response-trnd/index.html|publisher=[[CNN]]|access-date=27 March 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/march-for-our-lives-nra-responds/|title="March for Our Lives": NRA posts membership drive, YouTube video about march|work=CBS|first=Caroline |last=Linton|date=March 24, 2018|access-date=March 26, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Boggioni|first1=Tom|title='No one would know your names': NRA host taunts Parkland teens over their dead classmates on eve of DC march|url=https://www.rawstory.com/2018/03/no-one-know-names-nra-host-taunts-parkland-teens-dead-classmates-eve-dc-march/|publisher=[[The Raw Story]]|access-date=March 25, 2018}}</ref>

On the day of the protests, Florida [[Republican party of the United States|Republican]] senator [[Marco Rubio]] responded by stating: "However, many other Americans do not support a gun ban" and "view banning guns as an infringement on the Second Amendment rights of law abiding citizens that ultimately will not prevent these tragedies". He called for protesters to find "common ground with those who hold opposing views" for change to happen.

Former Republican senator and presidential candidate [[Rick Santorum]] criticized the Parkland activists, suggesting during an interview with [[CNN]] that students should be learning ways to respond to a shooter rather than asking lawmakers "to solve their problem"; Santorum advised students to take classes in [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation|CPR]] rather than marching in Washington.<ref name="twsPolitico5544">{{cite web |work=Politico |first=Kevin |last=Robillard |date=March 25, 2018 |url=https://www.politico.com/story/2018/03/25/santorum-cpr-parkland-students-guns-484543 |title=Santorum: Parkland students should learn CPR instead of marching |access-date=March 25, 2018 |quote=...

On social media, fake pictures and [[GIF]]s of [[Emma González]] tearing up a copy of the [[U.S. Constitution]] were circulated in an effort to discredit the march.

== Use of social media ==

Previously, protests had occurred for multiple [[Mass shootings in the United States|shootings in the United States]], such as the 2015 [[Charleston church shooting]], but never had they amassed more than several hundred participants. With social media, more information was relayed to a larger audience in quicker time, giving more people awareness of what was happening across the nation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.crimsonhexagon.com/blog/march-for-our-lives-was-born-on-social-media/|title=March for Our Lives was Born on Social Media|last=Hexagon|first=Crimson|website=www.crimsonhexagon.com|language=en-US|access-date=2019-04-02}}</ref> By National Walkout Day on April 20, 2018, the social medias had followings over 1.3 million people and in Washington D.C. alone, 200,000 people attended the March For Our Lives protest, whom many younger adults attributed to the big social media presence.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/march-for-our-lives-crowd-size-estimated-200000-people-attended-d-c-march/|title=How many people attended March for Our Lives?

=== Twitter ===

The use of [[Twitter]] started when this movement originated after the [[Stoneman Douglas High School shooting|Parkland shooting]] in Florida, where 17 individuals lost their lives.<ref>{{ Cite web| url=https://marchforourlives.com/mission-statement|title=Archived copy|access-date=10 April 2019|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20190410065136/https://marchforourlives.com/mission-statement |archive-date=10 April 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref> During the shooting, multiple students used Twitter, including freshman Aidan Minoff, who tweeted, "I am in a school shooting right now..."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/02/18/us/parkland-florida-school-shooting-accounts/index.html|title=Inside the Florida school massacre, moment by moment|author=Ray Sanchez|website=CNN|access-date=2019-04-10}}</ref> Twitter allowed others around the world to suddenly be aware of what was happening in real time and showing the raw emotion of these students. Twitter was a more "formal" news platform that supported greater two-way communication between the organization and the audience.

The March For Our Lives Twitter started in February 2018, with the Twitter handle, @AMarch4OurLives. Up to date, the Twitter account has 450,000 followers and are a student-run organization with a large social media presence.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://twitter.com/amarch4ourlives|title=March For Our Lives (@AMarch4OurLives) {{!}} Twitter|website=twitter.com|language=en|access-date=2019-04-02}}</ref> The March For Our Lives Twitter has real time, up to date tweets about the movement.

=== Facebook ===

The March For Our Lives movement employs [[Facebook]] as another social media platform to spread awareness of its campaigns and messages to people around the world. As of March 5th 2019, nineteen days before the one yer anniversary of the protests, the MFOL Facebook page has garnered more than 300,000 followers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/marchforourlives/|title=Facebook MOFL Page|website=facebook|language=en-US|access-date=2019-04-01}}</ref> The page is mainly used to provide updates on national policies regarding gun laws, as well as coverage of various politicians who advocate for more gun safety. Similar to other media platforms, the Facebook page frequently employs popular hashtags such as #MarchForOurLives and #NeverAgain in its posts. Although other social media platforms such as Twitter and Instagram often make posts to increase awareness, Facebook is more often used to organize people in nearby marches or demonstrations in major cities, and this has seen great success.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thecut.com/2018/03/march-for-our-lives-for-gun-control-will-be-on-march-24.html|title= Everything You Need to Know About the March for Our Lives|website= The Cut|language=en-US|access-date=2019-04-01}}</ref> For example, Facebook played a role in the March 24th 2018 March For Our Lives and Never Again collaboration gathering in Washington D.C., where more than 47,000 people marked themselves as "going," and where more than 89 to 100,000 people nation and worldwide marked themselves as "interested" on the Facebook events posting.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/events/pennsylvania-avenue-between-3rd-street-and-12th-street-nw/march-for-our-lives-dc-official/157161255003456/|title= March For Our Lives in D.C.|website= Facebook|language=en-US|access-date=2019-04-01}}</ref> This shows the magnitude of Facebook as a platform for organizing unrelated people to gather together for the same cause.
