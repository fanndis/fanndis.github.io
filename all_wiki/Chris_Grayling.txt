[[File:Chris Grayling.JPG|thumb|Grayling as Shadow Home Secretary in 2009]]
'''Christopher Stephen Grayling''' (born 1 April 1962) is a British [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] politician and author who served as [[Secretary of State for Transport]] from 2016 to 2019. He has served as [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] (MP) for [[Epsom and Ewell (UK Parliament constituency)|Epsom and Ewell]] since [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001]]. Grayling previously worked in the television and film industry.

Grayling was born in London and studied History at [[Cambridge University]].  He wrote a number of books as well as working for the [[BBC]] and [[Channel 4]] before going into politics. A member of the [[Social Democratic Party (UK)|Social Democratic Party]] until 1988, he then joined the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]]. First elected to [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] in the [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001 general election]] for [[Epsom and Ewell (UK Parliament constituency)|Epsom and Ewell]], he was appointed to the [[Shadow Cabinet of David Cameron]] in 2005 as [[Shadow Secretary of State for Transport]]. In 2007, he became the [[Shadow Secretary of State for Work and Pensions]], and in 2009 he was appointed [[Shadow Home Secretary]].

Following the [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010 general election]] and the formation of the [[Cameron–Clegg coalition]], Grayling was made [[Minister of State]] [[Department for Work and Pensions|for Employment]]. In September 2012, he was appointed to the [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|Cabinet]] as [[Lord Chancellor]] and [[Secretary of State for Justice]] and served until 2015. He was the first non-lawyer to have served as Lord Chancellor for at least 440 years. He was [[Leader of the House of Commons]] and the [[Lord President of the Council]] from 2015 to 2016. In the [[First May ministry|majority]] and [[Second May ministry|minority May governments]], Grayling served as [[Secretary of State for Transport]].

Grayling was stood down from the Cabinet when [[Boris Johnson]] became Prime Minister in July 2019. Johnson hoped for Grayling to become Chair of the [[Intelligence and Security Committee of Parliament|Intelligence and Security Committee]] by being voted in by the Conservative majority on the committee. However, fellow Conservative [[Julian Lewis]] defeated Grayling in the ballot by using opposition votes to secure a majority, in what was seen as a blow to Johnson and his adviser [[Dominic Cummings]]. Six weeks later, Grayling resigned from the committee apparently due to his failure to become chair.

==Early life and career==
Grayling was born in [[London]] and grew up in [[Buckinghamshire]], where he was educated at the [[Royal Grammar School, High Wycombe]]. He then went to [[Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge]], where he graduated with an upper-second class [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in history in 1984.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/0/who-is-chris-grayling-meet-the-new-transport-secretary/|title=Who is Chris Grayling?

Grayling joined [[BBC News]] in 1985 as a trainee, becoming a [[television producer|producer]] in 1986. He left the BBC in 1988 to join [[Channel 4]] as an [[editing|editor]] on its ''[[Business Daily (TV programme)|Business Daily]]'' television programme. He rejoined the BBC in 1991 as a business development manager on [[BBC Select]]. On leaving the BBC again in 1993, he briefly joined Charterhouse Productions as Managing Director before leaving several months later as it was wound up for failing to pay VAT.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Armstrong |first=Ashley |date=3 August 2016 |title=BHS saga shows why files must be retained |url=https://www.pressreader.com/uk/the-daily-telegraph/20160803/282802125718600 |magazine=The Daily Telegraph |location=Print |publisher=Press Reader |accessdate=6 March 2019 }}</ref> He ran several television production companies from late 1993, including managing the corporate communications division of Workhouse Ltd from 1992 to 1995 and [[Services Sound and Vision Corporation|SSVC Group]] in [[Gerrards Cross]] from 1995 to 1997.

Grayling became a public relations consultant in 1997 with [[Burson Marsteller]], where he remained until his election to [[House of Commons (UK)|Parliament]]. Prior to joining the Conservative Party, Grayling was a member of the [[Social Democratic Party (UK)|Social Democratic Party]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.libdemvoice.org/are-there-more-exsdp-members-on-the-tory-frontbench-than-the-lib-dem-frontbench-10833.html|title=Are there more ex-SDP members on the Tory front-bench than the Lib Dem front-bench?|publisher=Libdemvoice.org|date=30 January 2009|access-date=2 May 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161001205656/http://www.libdemvoice.org/are-there-more-exsdp-members-on-the-tory-frontbench-than-the-lib-dem-frontbench-10833.html|archive-date=1 October 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Grayling held the seat with a majority of 10,080 and has been returned as MP there since. He made his [[maiden speech]] on 25 June 2001.<ref>{{cite web|author=Department of the Official Report (Hansard), House of Commons, Westminster|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200102/cmhansrd/vo010625/debtext/10625-20.htm#10625-20_spnew1|title=House of Commons Hansard Debates for 25 Jun 2001 (pt 20)|publisher=Publications.parliament.uk|date=25 June 2001|access-date=2 May 2010}}</ref>

Grayling also challenged [[Tony Blair]] and his wife [[Cherie Blair|Cherie]] over the money they made from lectures while Blair was Prime Minister.  He also challenged [[Minister (government)|minister]] [[Stephen Byers]] over his handling of the [[Railtrack]] collapse.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article582876.ece |title="Cherie in trouble again" October 2005 |publisher=Timesonline.co.uk |access-date=29 July 2016}}</ref>

====Comparing Moss Side to ''The Wire''====
As Shadow Home Secretary, Grayling provoked controversy in August 2009 when he compared [[Manchester]]'s [[Moss Side]] area to the American TV crime drama ''[[The Wire]]''. His comments received an angry response from some Manchester locals and criticism from the police.<ref name="men260809">{{cite news|date=26 August 2009|title=Grayling's comments on Moss Side condemned|first= Chris|last= Osuh |url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/s/1133692_graylings_comments_on_moss_side_condemned|work=[[Manchester Evening News]]|access-date=12 December 2009}}</ref><ref name="bbc01">{{cite news|date=25 August 2009|title=Anger at Tory's Wire comparison |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/manchester/8221231.stm|work=[[BBC News]]|access-date=12 December 2009}}</ref> Having been out on patrol for a day with the police, observing the results of a shooting at a house, he described himself as having witnessed an "urban war".  Police responded that gang-related shootings in [[Greater Manchester]] had fallen by 82 percent from the previous year and that to speak of "urban war" was "sensationalistic".<ref name="men260809"/>

A local councillor, Roy Walters, complained of Moss Side unfairly being a "negative target" due to historical associations.<ref name="men260809"/> Defending his comments, Grayling said, "I didn't say Moss Side equals Baltimore.  What I said is that we have in Moss Side symptoms of a gang conflict in this country which I find profoundly disturbing."<ref name="bbc01" /> Baltimore, with a population of about 600,000, was noted as having 191 gun related murders in the previous year, in comparison to Moss Side, population 17,537, which had none.<ref name="men260809"/>

====Statistics controversy====
Grayling came under criticism as [[Her Majesty's Most Loyal Opposition (United Kingdom)|Shadow Home Secretary]] over the Conservative Party's use of statistics on violent crime.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/lies-damn-lies-and-tory-crime-statistics-1889927.html |title=Lies, damn lies and Tory crime statistics |date=5 February 2010 |access-date=7 April 2010 | location=London | work=The Independent | first=Andy | last=McSmith}}</ref> In February 2010, the Conservative Party issued press releases to every constituency in the UK claiming that crime had "risen sharply" in the UK.  They failed, however, to take into account the more rigorous system for recording crime. The chairman of the [[UK Statistics Authority]], [[Michael Scholar|Sir Michael Scholar]], said that the figures Grayling was using were "likely to mislead the public" and "likely to damage public trust in official statistics" as the way in which crime was calculated had been changed in 2002.<ref name=tele9mar10>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/7402232/Full-scale-of-violent-crime-revealed.html |title=Full scale of violent crime revealed|work=The Daily Telegraph|date= 9 March 2010|access-date= 24 May 2013}}</ref>

A Conservative-commissioned report by the independent House of Commons library suggested that, depending on how figures were calculated, Grayling's claims may have been justifiable and that violent crime may have risen in the period between 1998 and 2009.<ref name=tele9mar10/> The incumbent Home Secretary, [[Alan Johnson]], called Grayling's use of crime statistics "dodgy" and said that the British Crime Survey clearly showed that violent crime had reduced by 41% over the same period.<ref name=tele9mar10/>

====Gay couples in B&Bs controversy====
In March 2010, Grayling was recorded at an open meeting of the [[Centre for Policy Studies]] think tank saying that during the debates on civil liberties under the Labour Government, he had felt that Christians should have the right to live by their consciences and that Christian owners of [[bed and breakfast]]s should have the right to turn away gay couples.<ref>''[[BBC News]]'', 4 April 2010, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8602371.stm "Grayling suggests B&Bs should be able to bar gay guests", BBC News.]</ref> Grayling said:
<blockquote>"I personally always took the view that, if you look at the case of should a Christian hotel owner have the right to exclude a gay couple from a hotel, I took the view that if it's a question of somebody who's doing a B&B in their own home, that individual should have the right to decide who does and who doesn't come into their own home. If they are running a hotel on the high street, I really don't think that it is right in this day and age that a gay couple should walk into a hotel and be turned away because they are a gay couple, and I think that is where the dividing line comes."<ref>''The Observer'', 3 April 2010, [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/apr/03/tory-tape-gays-bed-breakfast Secret tape reveals Tory backing for ban on gays]</ref>

Anastasia Beaumont-Bott, founder of [[LGBTory (United Kingdom)|LGBTory]], a gay rights group which campaigns for the Conservatives, announced that she would be voting for [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]], not the Conservatives, in response to Grayling's comments. She said, "I feel guilty because as a gay woman affected by LGBT rights I am on record saying you should vote Conservative, and I want to reverse that. I want to go on record to say don't vote Conservative. I'd go as far to say that I'll vote Labour at this general election."<ref>''The Independent'', 8 April 2010, [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/im-voting-labour-founder-of-tory-gay-rights-group-says-1938700.html I'm voting Labour, founder of Tory gay rights group says]</ref> Beaumont-Bott was joined in defecting from the Conservatives to Labour a week later by gay rights campaigner David Heathcote.<ref>{{cite web|work=Pink News|date= 14 April 2010|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2010/04/14/video-david-miliband-welcomes-former-tories-who-have-quit-party-over-gay-rights/ |title=David Miliband welcomes former Tories who have quit party over gay rights}}</ref> Grayling's comments were defended by a number of commentators, including the [[Today (BBC Radio 4)|''Today Programme'']] presenter and gay broadcaster [[Evan Davis]] and leading Christian groups.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.christian.org.uk/news/bbcs-evan-davis-grayling-comments-not-homophobic/|title=BBC's Evan Davis: Grayling comments not 'homophobic'|work=The Christian Institute|date=28 April 2010}}</ref>

Grayling apologised on 9 April 2010, saying: "I am sorry if what I said gave the wrong impression, I certainly didn't intend to offend anyone... I voted for gay rights, I voted for [[Equality Act (Sexual Orientation) Regulations|this particular measure]]."

==Minister of State for Employment==
{{BLP sources section|date=December 2016}}
On 13 May 2010, Grayling was appointed [[Department for Work and Pensions|Minister of State for Employment]] and was sworn into the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]] on 28 May.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.number10.gov.uk/news/topstorynews/2010/05/her-majestys-government-49840 |title=Her Majesty's Government |publisher=Number10.gov.uk |date=19 May 2010 |access-date=13 November 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100515034600/http://www.number10.gov.uk/news/topstorynews/2010/05/her-majestys-government-49840 |archive-date=15 May 2010  }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.number10.gov.uk/news/peerages-honours-and-appointments/ |title=Peerages, honours and appointments Number 10 |publisher=Number10.gov.uk |date=28 May 2010 |access-date=7 November 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://privycouncil.independent.gov.uk/privy-council/privy-council-members/privy-counsellors/#g |title=Privy Counsellors &#124; Privy Council |publisher=Privycouncil.independent.gov.uk |access-date=7 November 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111221115352/http://privycouncil.independent.gov.uk/privy-council/privy-council-members/privy-counsellors/#g |archive-date=21 December 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> As minister at DWP he was responsible for jobcentres. Measures were introduced to reduce costs, leaving 100,000 staff redundant in offices around the country. In the context of a "Broken Society" he accused some families of being habitually unemployed, generation after generation, living in sink council estates in the inner cities. Government cuts were made to the DWP budgets in order to constrain welfare spending.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}

The policy later informed treatment of prisoners, refusing the right to vote, and clamping down on abusive behaviours in jails. He announced work programs for prisoners, encouraged an end to the "something for nothing culture". More people than ever were found fit to work as part of a package of measures in a £5&nbsp;billion program to make work for the long-term unemployed.<ref>{{cite news|last=Peacock |first=Louisa |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/jobs/9434461/Employment-Minister-Chris-Grayling-moves-to-push-more-people-on-benefits-back-into-work.html |title=Back to Work program |work=The Daily Telegraph |access-date=29 July 2016}}</ref>

== Secretary of State for Justice and Lord Chancellor ==
Grayling was promoted to the [[Cabinet (United Kingdom)|Cabinet]] on 4 September 2012, as [[Lord Chancellor]] and [[Secretary of State for Justice]]. Sworn in as Lord Chancellor on 1 October 2012 at Westminster Abbey,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.justice.gov.uk/news/features/chris-grayling-sworn-in-as-lord-chancellor|title=Chris Grayling sworn in as Lord Chancellor|work=justice.gov.uk|date=1 October 2012 }}</ref> he was elected an [[Bencher|Honorary Bencher]] of [[Gray's Inn]] on 11 December 2012, due in part to his lack of legal qualifications. He was the first non-lawyer to have served as Lord Chancellor for at least 440 years. (It was reported that the last such non-lawyer was the [[Anthony Ashley Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury|Earl of Shaftesbury]] in 1672–73;<ref name="scots">{{cite web|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/queen-s-speech-sketch-ceremony-changes-1-2923263|title=Queen's speech sketch: ceremony changes|work=scotsman.com}}</ref> but the Earl was admitted to [[Lincoln's Inn]] in 1638.<ref name="HOP">{{cite web|url=http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1660-1690/member/cooper-sir-anthony-ashley-1621-83|title=COOPER, Sir Anthony Ashley, 2nd Bt.

=== Prisoner reforms ===
One of Grayling's first acts at the [[Ministry of Justice]] (MoJ) was to commence a project to change the way offenders were rehabilitated in an effort to cut reoffending rates. Under a system of "payment by results", private companies as well as [[charities]] were to play a greater role in looking after offenders on licence in the community.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/rehabilitation-revolution-the-next-steps|title=Rehabilitation revolution: the next steps|work=www.gov.uk}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-22886395 | work=BBC News | title=Prison payment-by-results schemes see reoffending cut | date=13 June 2013}}</ref>

Grayling's ban on books being sent into [[Her Majesty's Prison Service|UK prisons]] was widely criticised by the [[Howard League for Penal Reform]] and the literary establishment, including [[Philip Pullman]], [[Mark Haddon]], [[Anthony Horowitz]], [[Susan Hill]] and [[Emma Donoghue]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/news/authors-blast-chris-graylings-vindictive-act-of-banning-prisoners-from-receiving-books-9212921.html|title=Authors blast Chris Grayling's 'vindictive act' of banning prisoners from receiving books|first=Chris |last=Green|date=24 March 2014|work=The Independent}}</ref> The ban was described as obscene by [[Shaun Attwood]] of the TV show ''[[Banged Up Abroad]]'' who read over a thousand books in prison and credited books for being the lifeblood of rehabilitation.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}
The move was defended as being not about a ban on books being sent into prison, but about parcels being sent in, as giving prisons access to the latter would almost certainly increase the amount of contraband getting into the prison estate.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/law-and-order/10742660/Nasty-Chris-Grayling-is-fighting-to-bring-the-justice-blob-to-book.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Isabel | last=Hardman | title=Nasty Chris Grayling is fighting to bring the justice 'blob' to book | date=3 April 2014}}</ref> The [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] ruled the ban illegal in December 2015.<ref name=Jessica>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jul/26/from-court-fees-to-a-books-ban-chris-grayling-short-lived-justice-policies|title=From court fees to a books ban: Chris Grayling's short-lived justice policies|first=Jessica |last=Elgot|work=Guardian newspapers|date=26 July 2017|access-date=21 January 2019}}</ref>

On stepping down from his role as [[Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Prisons]] Nick Harding criticised Grayling for "robustly" interfering with the contents of reports and Grayling's department for using financial controls to influence what was inspected, thereby threatening the independence of the Inspector's role.<ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/nick-hardwick-prisons-inspector-steps-down-with-attack-on-chris-grayling-for-trying-to-influence-his-a6824041.html|title= Nick Hardwick: Prisons inspector steps down with attack on Chris Grayling for trying to influence his work|work=The Independent|date= 20 January 2016|access-date=30 January 2016}}</ref>

In March 2019, the UK [[National Audit Office (United Kingdom)|National Audit Office]] issued a report on the reforms of the probation system in England and Wales initiated by Grayling during his tenure at the MoJ<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nao.org.uk/report/transforming-rehabilitation-progress-review/|title=Transforming Rehabilitation: Progress review - National Audit Office (NAO) Report|website=National Audit Office|access-date=3 March 2019}}</ref> stating that the Ministry had "set itself up to fail" through the "rushed implementation" of the reforms. As a result, the MoJ's aim of delivering cuts in reoffending had not been achieved, with reoffending rates having "increased significantly", at a cost £467 million higher than predicted.<ref name=guardian-20190301>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/mar/01/watchdog-slams-extremely-costly-probation-changes |title=Watchdog slams Grayling's 'costly' probation changes |last=Walker |first=Amy |newspaper=The Guardian |date=1 March 2019 |access-date=1 March 2019}}</ref><ref name=ph-20190301>{{cite news |url=https://www.politicshome.com/news/uk/home-affairs/justice-system/news/102186/spending-watchdogs-slam-chris-graylings-extremely |title=Spending watchdogs slam Chris Grayling's 'extremely costly' probation reforms |last=Schofield |first=Kevin |website=PoliticsHome |date=1 March 2019 |access-date=1 March 2019}}</ref> In May 2019 incumbent Justice Secretary, [[David Gauke]], announced offender supervision in England and Wales is to be returned to government control, under the management of the [[National Probation Service]], reversing Grayling's policy.

=== Prison benchmarking and staff cuts ===
A prison "benchmarking" programme was introduced in 2012 by Grayling to reduce the costs of [[Her Majesty's Prison Service|public sector prisons]] to match comparable private sector prisons, along with associated new core standards intended to result in prisoners having similar amounts of time spent outside their cells across similar prisons.<ref name="guardian-20140429">{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/apr/29/prisons-ordered-cust-costs-149-million-a-year |title=Prisons governors ordered to cut costs by £149m a year |first=Alan |last=Travis|first2= Steven |last2=Morris |newspaper=The Guardian |date=29 April 2014 |access-date=17 November 2016}}</ref> Prison officer numbers were reduced from about 23,000 in 2012 to about 18,000 in 2015.<ref name="bbc-20161103">{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-37854358 |title=Prisons to get 'biggest overhaul in a generation' |work=BBC News |date=3 November 2016 |access-date=17 November 2016}}</ref>

In 2015 the [[Justice Select Committee]], following a year long prison inquiry, were critical of Justice ministers for apparent complacency about a 38% rise in prison deaths since 2012.

=== A 'tough justice' agenda: court reforms ===
Grayling's proposed cuts to legal aid were widely criticised by the legal profession.

=== Justice department security failure ===
In January 2015, data relating to three fatal police shootings including details of marksmen and the deceased's family were lost in the post by the Justice Department.

In December 2016, Grayling blocked a move by the [[Mayor of London]] [[Sadiq Khan]] to give control of the metro services run by [[Southeastern (train operating company)|Southeastern]] to [[Transport for London]]. A leaked 2013 letter revealed Grayling had previously written to then-London mayor [[Boris Johnson]] saying he opposed such a move because it could put those services "in the clutches of a Labour mayor". The leak led to Grayling being accused of putting his party's political interests over those of the public and commuters, as well as members of his own party calling for his resignation.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Mason|first1=Rowena|title=Rail letter leak: Chris Grayling accused of putting politics over people|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/dec/07/chris-grayling-accused-of-putting-politics-over-people-in-rail-letter-leak|access-date=17 December 2016|work=The Guardian|date=7 December 2016}}</ref>

[[Eurotunnel]], operator of the [[Channel Tunnel]], initiated legal action against the Department for Transport, claiming that the awarding of ferry contracts for the event of a no-deal Brexit had been "secretive and flawed", and that Eurotunnel, which also operates freight services across the English Channel, had not had the opportunity to compete.

===Delays and cost overruns to introduction of Class 800 trains===
In March 2019, [[Andrew Adonis, Baron Adonis|Lord Adonis]], former Labour transport minister, was critical of the delay in implementing services on the [[East Coast Main Line|East Coast Mainline]], using [[British Rail Class 800|Class 800]] trains.
