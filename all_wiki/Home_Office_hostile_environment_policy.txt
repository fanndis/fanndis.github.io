==Origin of the term==
In 2012 [[Theresa May]], who was the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] [[Home Secretary]] at the time, introduced the Hostile Environment Policy saying that: "The aim is to create, here in Britain, a really hostile environment for illegal immigrants".<ref name=":0"/> In May 2007 [[Liam Byrne]], who was the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] [[Minister of State for Immigration|immigration minister]] at the time, had referred to a "hostile environment" in an announcement of a consultation document: "We are trying to create a much more hostile environment in this country if you are here illegally".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/may/16/immigration.immigrationandpublicservices|title=Officials launch drive to seek out illegal migrants at work |last=Travis|first=Alan|date=2007-05-16|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|language=en|access-date=2019-08-10}}</ref>

== Policy ==

In October 2013 May stated, "we will extend the number of non-suspensive appeals so that, where there is no risk of serious and irreversible harm, we can deport first and hear appeals later".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=22 Oct 2013|title=Oral Answers to Questions|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131022/debtext/131022-0001.htm|journal=Parliamentary Business|volume=Column 131|pages=|via=Parliament home page}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/theresa-boasted-home-secretary-would-12398544|title=Theresa May boasted she would 'deport first and hear appeals later'|first=Nicola|last=Bartlett|date=20 April 2018|website=Mirror.co.uk|accessdate=13 February 2019}}</ref>

The policy also implemented a more complicated application process to get 'leave to remain' based on the principle of 'deport first, appeal later', whilst encouraging voluntary deportation though strategies including [["Go Home" vans]] as part of "Operation Vaken", as well as adverts in newspapers, shops, and charity and faith buildings used by ethnic minorities.{{sfn|Grierson|2018}}<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/av/uk-politics-43831563/windrush-what-is-the-hostile-environment-immigration-policy|title=What is the 'hostile environment' policy?|website=BBC News|access-date=2018-04-19}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/may/16/footage-emerges-of-distressing-home-visit-by-immigration-officers|title=Footage emerges of 'distressing' home visit by immigration officers|last1=Gentleman|first1=Amelia|last2=Bannock|first2=Caroline|date=2018-05-16|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|language=en|access-date=2018-05-16}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/may/18/jimmy-thoronka-sierra-leonean-athlete-leave-to-remain-uk|title=Sierra Leonean athlete can stay in UK after three-year legal fight|last=Siddique|first=Haroon|date=2018-05-18|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|language=en|access-date=2018-05-19}}</ref>

<blockquote>Long drawn-out legal processes are traumatic for anyone, let alone those who have fled persecution.

A 2018 governmental review revealed that the Home Office had tried to deport at least 300 highly skilled migrants (including teachers, doctors, lawyers, engineers and IT professionals) under the 322(5) provision, at least 87 successfully. This mostly affected people who had lived in the UK for more than 10 years and had children born in the UK. Many were given only 14 days to leave the UK and were made ineligible to apply for visas to return. The review found that 65% of 322(5) decisions were overturned by an upper tribunal and 45% of applicants for judicial review were successful (28% of judicial reviews found in favour of the defendant). Additionally the review found that 32% of "complex cases" were wrongly decided.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/nov/23/home-office-tried-to-deport-300-skilled-migrants-under-terrorism-law|title=Home Office tried to deport 300 skilled migrants under terrorism law|last=Hill|first=Amelia|date=2018-11-23|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|language=en|access-date=2018-11-23}}</ref>

== Criticism ==

The policy has been criticised for being unclear, has led to many incorrect threats of deportation and has been called "Byzantine" by the [[Court of Appeal (England and Wales)|England and Wales Court of Appeal]] for its complexity.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/government-s-hostile-environment-policy-too-open-to-error-and-risks-undermining-credibility-of-a8158656.html|title=Britain's immigration system 'too open to error', MPs warn|date=2018-01-14|work=The Independent|access-date=2018-04-16|language=en-GB}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/home-office-immigration-checks-bank-accounts-mps-campaign-groups-urge-stop-caroline-lucas-david-a8118251.html|title=Home Office urged to stop 'inhumane' immigration checks on bank accounts|date=2017-12-19|work=The Independent|access-date=2018-04-16|language=en-GB}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.the3million.org.uk/hostile-environment|title=the3million {{!}} preserving the rights of EU citizens living in the UK|website=The3million.org.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-04-16}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/04/disabled-briton-held-immigration-removal-centre-four-months|title=Disabled Briton held in immigration removal centre for four months|last=Taylor|first=Diane|date=2018-04-04|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|language=en|access-date=2018-04-16}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/blog/home-office-must-drop-hostile-environment-approach-brexit|title=The Home Office must drop 'hostile environment' approach for Brexit|date=2018-04-13|work=The Institute for Government|access-date=2018-04-16|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.politics.co.uk/comment-analysis/2017/11/22/the-fightback-against-may-s-hostile-environment-has-begun|title=The fightback against May's hostile environment has begun|work=politics.co.uk|access-date=2018-04-16|language=en}}</ref><ref>Colin Yeo, '[https://www.freemovement.org.uk/how-complex-are-the-uk-immigration-rules-and-is-this-a-problem/ How complex is UK immigration law and is this a problem?]' (24/01/18) on Free Movement</ref> 

The immigration lawyer and campaigner Colin Yeo described the effect of the policy as: "the creation of an illegal underclass of foreign, mainly ethnic minority workers and families who are highly vulnerable to exploitation and who have no access to the social and welfare safety net."<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://neweuropeans.net/article/1927/hostile-environment-what-it-and-who-does-it-affect|title=The hostile environment: what is it and who does it affect?|last=Ward|first=Jon|date=2017-06-03|access-date=2018-05-01|language=en}}</ref>

In December 2018, it emerged that enforcement of the "hostile environment" policy in one part of the UK government – the Home Office – was dooming to failure initiatives championed and funded by other parts of the UK government.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/dec/16/uk-efforts-to-tackle-iraq-war-aftermath-hampered-by-hostile-immigration-policy|title=UK efforts in Iraq 'hindered by hostile immigration policy'|first=Matthew|last=Weaver|date=16 December 2018|website=Theguardian.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jan/02/women-forced-into-marriage-overseas-asked-to-repay-cost-of-return-to-uk|title=Women forced into marriage overseas asked to repay cost of return to UK|last=Busby|first=Mattha|date=2019-01-02|work=The Guardian|access-date=2019-01-02|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>

A September 2020 report on the Hostile Environment by the [[Institute for Public Policy Research]] found that the policy had "contributed to forcing many people into destitution, has helped to foster racism and discrimination, and has erroneously affected people with the legal right to live and work in the UK."<ref>https://www.ippr.org/research/publications/access-denied</ref>

A Equality and Human Rights Commission report released in November 2020 found that the Home Office had broken its public sector equality duty with the Hostile Environment policy and that the Office, including its senior leadership, routinely ignored the negative consequences of the policy.<ref>https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/nov/25/home-office-broke-equalities-law-with-hostile-environment-measures</ref>

===Police===
Out of the 45 UK territorial police forces, over half acknowledged handing over the details of migrant victims and witnesses of crimes to the Home Office for immigration enforcement, while only 3 denied doing so.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Nye |first1=Catrin |last2=Bloomer |first2=Natalie |last3=Jeraj |first3=Samir |title=Victims of serious crime face arrest over immigration status |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-44074572 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191202173818/https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-44074572 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2019-12-02 |accessdate=2020-02-05 |work=BBC News |date=2018-05-14}}</ref>

Several cases of victims of serious crimes, including rape, being arrested upon reporting the crime have been uncovered.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Siddique |first1=Haroon |last2=Rawlinson |first2=Kevin |title=Rape victim arrested on immigration charges after going to police |url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/nov/28/victim-arrested-on-immigration-charges-after-going-to-police |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191208074330/https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/nov/28/victim-arrested-on-immigration-charges-after-going-to-police |url-status=dead |archive-date=2019-12-08 |accessdate=2020-02-06 |work=The Guardian |date=2017-11-28}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/may/14/victims-crime-handed-over-police-immigration-enforcement|title=Victims of crime being handed over to immigration enforcement|last=Taylor|first=Diane|date=2018-05-14|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|language=en|access-date=2018-05-14}}</ref> Step Up Migrant Women Campaign, a coalition of dozens of organisations working with migrant victims of domestic abuse, was formed in response to this trend.<ref>{{cite web |title=Step Up Migrant Women |url=https://stepupmigrantwomen.org/}}</ref>

Amid criticisms, the [[National Police Chiefs’ Council]] issued a guidance in December 2018 which declares that "the fundamental principle must be for the police to first and foremost treat [the person reporting a crime] as a victim" and advises against systematic checking of victims' immigration status for the purpose of sharing that information with immigration enforcement. In addition, while the guidance states that, upon discovering irregular immigration status, "it is wholly appropriate that the officer in the case should contact immigration enforcement at the appropriate juncture", it does posit that no enforcement action beyond information-sharing should be taken by police outside of safeguarding concerns.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Dodd |first1=Vikram |title=Police to stop passing on immigration status of crime victims |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/dec/07/police-to-stop-passing-on-immigration-status-of-victims |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191101120835/https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/dec/07/police-to-stop-passing-on-immigration-status-of-victims |url-status=dead |archive-date=2019-11-01 |accessdate=2020-02-06 |work=The Guardian |date=2018-12-07}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.npcc.police.uk/releases/new-guidance-for-officers-on-sharing-information-with-immigration-enforcement|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200206103157/https://news.npcc.police.uk/releases/new-guidance-for-officers-on-sharing-information-with-immigration-enforcement|url-status=dead|archive-date=2020-02-06|title=New guidance for officers on sharing information with Immigration Enforcement|date=2018-12-07|accessdate=2020-02-05|website=npcc.police.uk}}</ref>

The practice is thought to lead to the under-reporting of crime against undocumented people in the UK due to a fear of arrest and deportation of the victims.<ref name=":1" /><ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-16/may-s-past-bites-her-as-minister-admits-wrongful-deportations |title=May's Past Bites Her as Minister Admits Wrongful Deportations |date=2018-04-16 |work=Bloomberg.com |access-date=2018-04-16 |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-43726976|title='Windrush generation' deportation threat|date=2018-04-11|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-04-16|language=en-GB}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/16/theresa-may-caribbean-representatives-windrush-immigration |title=Amber Rudd pledges action to resolve status of Windrush citizens |last1=Gentleman |first1=Amelia |last2=Crerar |first2=Pippa |date=2018-04-16 |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |language=en |access-date=2018-04-16}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.holyrood.com/articles/inside-politics/no-recourse-public-funds-how-uks-hostile-environment-policy-driving-people|title=No recourse to public funds: How the UK's hostile environment policy is driving people into destitution|date=2018-01-17|work=Holyrood Magazine|access-date=2018-04-16|language=en}}</ref> Deeming the NPCC's guidance insufficient to provide protection to victims, various charities called for the implementation of a firewall, a complete ban on information-sharing, between police and immigration officials.

===Housing===
{{Expand section|date=February 2020}}

In January 2019, it emerged that tight restrictions on the right to rent (i.e. the right to become a tenant), under the "hostile environment" policy, had caused homelessness for some British citizens living in Britain.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/british-man-rent-property-home-office-right-to-rent-hostile-environment-homeless-a8754216.html|title=British man and family made homeless by Home Office after it blocks them from renting property|date=30 January 2019|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|accessdate=30 January 2019}}</ref>

===Deportation of people at risk of murder or torture===
{{Expand section|date=February 2019}}
The Home Office has been strongly criticised for its deportation, under the hostile environment policy, of people to countries where they are known to be at particular risk of being tortured or killed, such as Afghanistan and Zimbabwe. This practice is prohibited by [[Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights]], which forms part of UK law as part of the [[Human Rights Act 1998]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/feb/12/home-office-criticised-for-accelerating-removals-to-zimbabwe|title=Home Office criticised for accelerating removals to Zimbabwe|first=Frances|last=Perraudin|date=12 February 2019|accessdate=13 February 2019|website=Theguardian.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/afghanistan-turyalai-khaksar-bomb-theresa-may-deport-uxbridge-a8322396.html|title=Man injured in bomb blast as a child waiting to hear whether Theresa May can deport him to Afghanistan|date=25 April 2018|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|accessdate=13 February 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/feb/12/i-can-hardly-sleep-the-zimbabweans-facing-deportation-from-uk|title='I can hardly sleep': the Zimbabweans facing deportation from UK|first=Frances|last=Perraudin|date=12 February 2019|accessdate=13 February 2019|website=Theguardian.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/10/i-fear-for-my-life-uk-urged-not-to-deport-zimbabwean-activist|title='I fear for my life': UK urged not to deport Zimbabwean activist|first=Amelia|last=Hill|date=10 September 2018|accessdate=13 February 2019|website=Theguardian.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/feb/25/afghanistan-gay-asylum-seekers-home-office-illegal-homosexuality|title=Deported gay Afghans told to 'pretend to be straight'|first=Emma|last=Graham-Harrison|date=26 February 2017|accessdate=13 February 2019|website=Theguardian.com}}</ref> In 2017, the Home Office under [[Amber Rudd]] deported a refugee back to Afghanistan in spite of a High Court order not to, was found in contempt of court<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/sep/14/home-secretary-ignores-court-order-sends-asylum-seeker-kabul-samim-bigzad|work=The Guardian|title=Home secretary ignores court order and sends asylum seeker to Kabul|first=Diane|last=Taylor|date=14 September 2017|accessdate=27 May 2019|quote="The second [court order] states that the home secretary, Amber Rudd, is in contempt of court for breaching the first order not to remove [Samim] Bigzad."}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.lawcareers.net/Information/News/Amber-Rudd-in-contempt-of-court-for-ignoring-judges-order-not-to-deport-asylum|work=LawCareers.net|title=Amber Rudd in contempt of court for ignoring judge's order not to deport asylum seeker to Afghanistan|date=20 September 2017|accessdate=27 May 2019|quote="Home Secretary Amber Rudd is in contempt of court after ignoring the orders of successive judges not to deport an asylum seeker [Samim Bigzad] to Afghanistan (...)."}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/19/home-secretary-courts-amber-rudd-deport-samim-bigzad|work=The Guardian|title=If Amber Rudd can't explain why she defied the courts, she should go|first=Charles|last=Falconer|date=19 September 2017|accessdate=27 May 2019|quote="[Mr Justice Jay] said that the Home Office was already “prima facie” in contempt (...)."}}</ref> and on review was ordered to return him.

===Mistreatment of trafficking victims===

In comments seen by the press as distancing himself from his predecessor as Home Secretary, Theresa May, Javid told Parliament that "I don't like the phrase hostile.
