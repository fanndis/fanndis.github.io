The '''Nashville Symphony''' is an American symphony orchestra, based in [[Nashville, Tennessee]].  The orchestra is resident at the [[Schermerhorn Symphony Center]].

==History==
In 1920, prior to the 1946 founding of the Nashville Symphony, a group of amateur and professional musicians established an orchestral ensemble in Nashville, electing ''Nashville Banner'' music critic and [[Vanderbilt University]] professor George Pullen Jackson to serve as their president and manager.  Despite steady growth over the next decade, that organization fell victim to [[The Depression]]. In 1945, World War II veteran and Nashville native Walter Sharp returned home from the war intent on establishing a new symphony for Middle Tennessee.<ref>{{cite web | author=Young, Stephen E. | title=Nashville | url=http://www.grovemusic.com/shared/views/article.html?section=music.41665 | work=Grove Music Online ed | publisher=Oxford University Press | date= | accessdate=2008-02-06 }}{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>  With the assistance of a small number of fellow music lovers, he convinced community leaders of this need and the Nashville Symphony was founded.

Sharp retained [[William Strickland (conductor)|William Strickland]], a young conductor from New York, to serve as its first music director and conductor.  The orchestra performed its first concert in the fall of 1946 at War Memorial Auditorium in downtown Nashville. Over the ensuing five seasons, Strickland was responsible for setting the high performance standards that the orchestra and its conductors have maintained to this day.  Guy Taylor (1951–1959), [[Willis Page]] (1959–1967), [[Thor Johnson]] (1967–1975) and Michael Charry (1976–1982) were successive music directors.  During Charry's tenure, the symphony moved its subscription series from War Memorial Auditorium to Jackson Hall in the [[Tennessee Performing Arts Center]].

Beginning in 1983, Music Director and Principal Conductor [[Kenneth Schermerhorn]] led the Nashville Symphony for 22 years, until his death in April 2005.  The orchestra's profile increased during his tenure through recordings, television broadcasts and an East Coast tour, which culminated in a performance at Carnegie Hall on September 25, 2000.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.playbillarts.com/news/article/1867.html | title=Kenneth Schermerhorn, Longtime Nashville Symphony Conductor, Dies at 75 | work=Playbill Arts | author=Ben Mattison | date=19 April 2005 | accessdate=2007-09-08}}</ref>  Following Schermerhorn's death, in April 2006, [[Leonard Slatkin]] was named the orchestra's artistic advisor, for a contract of three years, through 2009.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.playbillarts.com/news/article/5109.html | title=Leonard Slatkin Joins Nashville Symphony as Artistic Advisor While Music Director Search Continues | work=Playbill Arts | author=Vivien Schweitzer | date=24 August 2006 | accessdate=2007-09-08}}</ref>

==Education and Community Engagement==
Music education has been an integral part of the Nashville Symphony's mission for much of its existence. Early in the orchestra's history, ensembles of musicians visited local schools. The orchestra has also offered free concerts for Nashville-area students since at least the 1970s. Most recently, the orchestra launched the Accelerando program, which is designed to create opportunities for young musicians from ethnic communities underrepresented in American orchestras. The program has received funding from the [[Andrew W. Mellon Foundation]].
