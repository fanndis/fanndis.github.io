'''Prime Minister's Questions''' ('''PMQs''', officially known as '''Questions to the Prime Minister''', while colloquially known as '''Prime Minister's Question Time''') is a [[constitutional convention (political custom)|constitutional convention]] in the [[United Kingdom]], currently held as a single session every Wednesday at noon when the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] is sitting, during which the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] answers questions from [[Member of Parliament|Members of Parliament]] (MPs).<ref name="PMQ">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/a-z_of_parliament/p-q/82556.stm | title=Prime Minister's Questions|date=24 January 2006| work =[[BBC News Online]]}}</ref>

== History ==
Although prime ministers have answered questions in parliament for centuries, until the 1880s, questions to the prime minister were treated the same as questions to other [[Ministers of the Crown]]: asked without notice, on days when ministers were available in whatever order MPs rose to ask them.<ref name="Bercow">{{cite web |url=http://www.parliament.uk/business/news/2010/07/speaker-delivers-speech-on-prime-ministers-questions/speech-new-parliament-new-opportunity/ |title=Speech: New Parliament, New Opportunity |last=Bercow |first=John |author-link=John Bercow |date= 6 July 2010 |work=[[House of Commons Library]] |publisher=parliament.uk  |access-date=22 July 2010}}</ref> In 1881 fixed time-limits for questions were introduced and questions to the prime minister were moved to the last slot of the day as a courtesy to the 72-year-old prime minister at the time, [[William Gladstone]], so he could come to the Commons later in the day. In 1953, when [[Winston Churchill]] (in his late 70s at the time) was prime minister, it was agreed that questions would be submitted on fixed days (Tuesdays and Thursdays).<ref name="Bercow"/>

A [[Procedure Committee]] report in 1959 recommended that questions to the prime minister be taken in two fixed-period, 15-minute slots on Tuesday and Thursday afternoons. The recommendations were put into practice under [[Harold Macmillan]] during a successful experiment from 18 July 1961 to the end of the session on 4 August.<ref>{{cite hansard |title=Questions to the Prime Minister |jurisdiction=United Kingdom |url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1961/jul/18/questions-to-the-prime-minister |house=House of Commons |date=18 July 1961 |column_start=1052 |column_end=1052 }}</ref> The very first question was delivered by [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] MP [[Fenner Brockway]], asking to which Minister the [[List of High Commissioners of the United Kingdom to South Africa#Ambassadors|UK Ambassador to South Africa]] would be responsible.<ref name="Hansard 1961">{{cite hansard |title=Ambassador to South Africa |jurisdiction=United Kingdom |url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1961/jul/18/ambassador-to-south-africa |house=House of Commons |date=18 July 1961 |column_start=1052 |column_end=1053 }}</ref> In response to the Prime Minister's answer, Brockway said "May I express our appreciation of this new arrangement for answering Questions and the hope that it will be convenient for the Prime Minister as well as useful to the House?"<ref name="Hansard 1961" /> PMQs were made permanent in the following parliamentary session, with the first of these on 24 October 1961.<ref name="Bercow"/><ref>{{cite hansard |title=Questions to the Prime Minister |jurisdiction=United Kingdom |url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1961/oct/24/questions-to-the-prime-minister |house=House of Commons |date=24 October 1961 |column_start=740 |column_end=747 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://number10.gov.uk/page1232 |archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20080909000758/number10.gov.uk/page1232 |url-status=dead |archive-date=9 September 2008 |title=What are Prime Minister's Questions? |date=21 January 2004 |publisher=number10.gov.uk |access-date=22 July 2010}}</ref>

The style and culture of PMQs has changed gradually over time. According to [[Speaker of the House of Commons (United Kingdom)|Speaker]] [[Selwyn Lloyd]], the now famous disorderly behaviour of MPs during PMQs first arose as a result of the personal animosity between [[Harold Wilson]] and [[Edward Heath]]; before this PMQs had been lively but comparatively civilised.<ref name="Bercow"/><ref>{{cite book |title=Mr. Speaker, sir |last=Lloyd |first=Selwyn |author-link=Selwyn Lloyd |year=1976 |isbn=978-0-224-01318-5}}</ref> In the past, prime ministers often opted to transfer questions to the relevant minister, and [[Leader of the Opposition (United Kingdom)|Leaders of the Opposition]] did not always take their allocated number of questions in some sessions, sometimes opting not to ask any questions at all. This changed during the [[premiership of Margaret Thatcher]], when the prime minister chose not to transfer any questions to other members of her [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|Cabinet]], and [[Leader of the Labour Party (UK)|Labour leader]] [[Neil Kinnock]] began asking more questions than his predecessors. His successor, [[John Smith (Labour Party leader)|John Smith]], established the precedent of always taking his full allocation of questions.<ref name="Bercow"/>
[[File:Prime Minister's Questions (Full Chamber).jpg|thumb|The chamber is much busier than at most other times.]]

One of [[Tony Blair]]'s first acts as prime minister was to replace the two 15-minute sessions with a single 30-minute session on Wednesdays, initially at 3 p.m. but since 2003 at noon.<ref name="Bercow"/> The allocated number of questions in each session for the Leader of the Opposition was doubled from three to six, and the leader of the third-largest party in the Commons was given two questions as opposed to one question beforehand. The first PMQs to use this new format took place on 21 May 1997.<ref>{{cite hansard |title=Questions to the Prime Minister |jurisdiction=United Kingdom |url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm199798/cmhansrd/vo970521/debtext/70521-18.htm |house=House of Commons |date=21 May 1997 |column_start=702 |column_end=712}}</ref>

During the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]]-[[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]] [[Cameron–Clegg coalition|coalition government]] from 2010–2015, the [[List of leaders of the Liberal Democrats|leader of the Liberal Democrats]], as a member of the government, did not ask questions during PMQs.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4115878.stm |title=What is Prime minister's questions?|date=2 June 2010 |publisher=[[BBC News]]}}</ref> Instead, the leader of the second largest parliamentary opposition party at the time, [[Nigel Dodds]] of the [[Democratic Unionist Party]] (DUP), usually asked a single question later in the session, followed by at least one MP from another smaller party such as the [[Scottish National Party]] or [[Plaid Cymru]].

== Practice ==
[[File:British House of Commons Order Paper (24 June 2009).JPG|thumb|right|The [[Order Paper]] for Wednesday, 24 June 2009.]]
[[Backbencher|Backbench]] MPs wishing to ask a question must enter their names on the [[Order Paper]]. The names of entrants are then shuffled in a ballot to produce a random order in which they will be called by the Speaker. The Speaker will then call on MPs to put their questions, usually in an alternating fashion: one MP from the government benches is followed by one from the opposition benches. MPs who are not selected may be chosen to ask a supplementary question if they "catch the eye" of the Speaker, which is done by standing and sitting immediately before the prime minister gives an answer.

The [[Leader of the Opposition (United Kingdom)|Leader of the Opposition]] usually asks six questions at PMQs, either as a whole block or in two separate groups of three. If the first question is asked by a government backbencher, the Leader of the Opposition is the second MP to ask questions. If the first question is asked by an opposition MP, this will be followed by a question from a government MP and then by the questions from the Leader of the Opposition. The leader of the third largest parliamentary party (the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] from 1988–2010 and the [[Scottish National Party]] from 2015) would then ask two questions.

The first formal question on the Order Paper, posed by simply saying "Number one, Mr. Speaker", is usually to ask the Prime Minister "if s/he will list his/her engagements for the day". The Prime Minister usually replies:{{bquote|This morning I had meetings with ministerial colleagues and others. In addition to my duties in this House, I shall have further such meetings later today.<ref>{{cite hansard |title=Questions to the Prime Minister | jurisdiction=United Kingdom | url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm198889/cmhansrd/1989-11-14/Orals-3.html  | house=House of Commons | date=1989-11-14 | column_start=178 | column_end=179 }}</ref><ref>{{cite hansard |title=Questions to the Prime Minister | jurisdiction=United Kingdom | url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm199091/cmhansrd/1990-12-18/Orals-2.html | house=House of Commons | date=1990-12-18 | column_start=150 | column_end=151 }}</ref><ref>{{cite hansard |title=Questions to the Prime Minister | jurisdiction=United Kingdom | url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm199798/cmhansrd/vo971119/debtext/71119-20.htm#71119-20_sbhd4 | house=House of Commons | date=1997-11-19 | column_start=318 | column_end=319 }}</ref><ref>{{cite hansard |title=Questions to the Prime Minister | jurisdiction=United Kingdom | url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm071010/debtext/71010-0002.htm#07101031000010 | house=House of Commons | date=2007-10-10 | column_start=286 | column_end=287 }}</ref><ref>{{cite hansard |title=Questions to the Prime Minister | jurisdiction=United Kingdom | url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm100630/debtext/100630-0002.htm#10063036000007 | house=House of Commons | date=2010-06-30 | column_start=852 | column_end=853 }}</ref><ref>{{cite hansard |title=Questions to the Prime Minister | jurisdiction=United Kingdom | url=https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2016-10-12/debates/B2183E5C-B667-4130-8499-CDB2E7D60B7B/Engagements#contribution-E2111243-FC22-4338-8AF9-807CEFAE31A0 | house=House of Commons | date=2016-10-12 | column_start=293| column_end=294}}</ref><ref>{{cite hansard |title=Questions to the Prime Minister | jurisdiction=United Kingdom | url=https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2020-01-15/debates/2CA2C0F3-F47F-4201-AFB2-3D951B3C2F29/Engagements#contribution-4708148B-57EB-47D9-B81C-12B0C4BA77A6 | house=House of Commons | date=2020-01-15 | column_start=1013| column_end=1014}}</ref>}}

The reason for such a question is that, historically, the Prime Minister may be questioned only as to those matters for which he or she is directly responsible.  Such matters are relatively few in number, because many substantive matters are handled by the other Ministers in the Cabinet.  By requiring the Prime Minister to list his or her engagements, the members may then inquire whether the Prime Minister ought to be engaged in some other activity or be taking some other action.<ref>Biffen, John (1989) ''Inside the House of Commons: Behind the Scenes at Westminster''. London: Grafton. {{isbn|0246134798}}</ref>

Before listing the day's engagements, the Prime Minister sometimes extends condolences or offers congratulations after significant events. During the [[Iraq War]], [[Tony Blair]] introduced the practice of naming any British military personnel who had been killed in service since the last time he addressed the House. This practice was continued by Blair's successors as prime minister. After this, the MP may ask a supplementary question about any subject which might occupy the Prime Minister's time. Most MPs [[Table (parliamentary procedure)#Example of Anglo.E2.80.90American confusion|table]] the same engagements question and so after it has been asked for the first time, any other MPs who have tabled the same question are simply called to ask an untabled question, meaning that the Prime Minister will not know what questions will be asked.<ref name="Question Time">{{cite web |url=http://www.parliament.uk/about/how/business/questions/ |title=Question Time |work=[[House of Commons Library]] |publisher=parliament.uk  |access-date=25 July 2010}}</ref>

Occasionally the first question tabled is on a specific area of policy, not the engagements question. This, though, is quite rare as it would allow the Prime Minister to prepare a response in advance; the non-descript question allows some chance of catching him or her out with an unexpected supplementary question.<ref name="Question Time"/>

At times of national or personal tragedy or crisis, PMQs have been temporarily suspended. The last such suspension occurred on 25 February 2009 when the Speaker, at the request of Prime Minister [[Gordon Brown]], suspended the Commons until 12:30&nbsp;p.m. as a mark of respect following the unexpected death of Opposition leader [[David Cameron]]'s son. Prime Minister's Questions was also suspended after the sudden death of the leader of the Labour Party, [[John Smith (Labour Party leader)|John Smith]], in 1994.<ref>{{cite news |authors=Andrew Grice |title=Politics put on hold as House mourns death of leader's son |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/politics-put-on-hold-as-house-mourns-death-of-leaders-son-1632389.html |work=[[The Independent]] |publisher=independent.co.uk |date=26 February 2009 |access-date=2009-02-26 }}</ref>

=== Absence of the Prime Minister or Leader of the Opposition === 
If the Prime Minister is away on official business when PMQs is scheduled, their role is usually filled by the [[Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Deputy Prime Minister]].<ref name="12 March">{{cite web|title=Prime Minister's Questions: 12 March 2014|url=http://www.parliament.uk/business/news/2014/march/prime-ministers-questions-12-march-2014/|publisher=UK Parliament|access-date=27 April 2015}}</ref> If this office is not occupied or the Deputy Prime Minister is not available, the next most senior member of [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|the Cabinet]] will receive questions (such as the [[First Secretary of State]] or the Deputy Leader of the government party).<ref>{{cite web|last1=Williamson|first1=David|title=In a PMQs without the PM, William Hague and Harriet Harman join forces to love-bomb the Scots|url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/pmqs-without-pm-william-hague-7749254|publisher=Wales Online|access-date=27 April 2015}}</ref> In the absence of the Leader of the Opposition, the opposition questions will be usually led by the next highest ranking member of the Shadow Cabinet. From 1992 to 2020, a convention was in place so that if either the Prime Minister or the Leader of the Opposition is absent, the other faction would nominate someone to stand, meaning that both sides were stood in for.<ref name="12 March" /> This precedent was broken at [[Keir Starmer|Sir Keir Starmer]]'s first PMQs as [[Leader of the Opposition]], as Prime Minister [[Boris Johnson]] was hospitalised due to illness with [[COVID-19]]. [[First Secretary of State]] [[Dominic Raab]] stood in for the Prime Minister.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.parliament.uk/business/news/2020/april1/prime-ministers-questions-wednesday-22-april/|title=Prime Minister's Questions 22nd April 2020|publisher=Parliament.uk|access-date=25 July 2020}}</ref> On 16 September 2020, a member of Starmer's household displayed [[COVID-19]] symptoms, meaning he was self-isolating. As a result, [[Deputy Leader of the Labour Party (UK)|Deputy Leader of the Labour Party]] and [[Shadow First Secretary of State]], [[Angela Rayner]] stood in for him putting questions to Johnson. Before 1992, the replacement would often question the Prime Minister or vice versa. For example, [[Roy Hattersley]], the [[Deputy Leader of the Labour Party (UK)|Deputy Leader of the Labour Party]] between 1983–92, stood in for [[Neil Kinnock]] facing [[Margaret Thatcher]] on 38 occasions between February 1984 and July 1990.<ref>https://api.parliament.uk/historic-hansard/people/mr-roy-hattersley/index.html</ref>

[[Boris Johnson]] also became the first prime minister taking PMQs outside the chamber virtually after having been told to isolate by NHS Test and Trace as he met with [[Lee Anderson (British politician)|Lee Anderson]] who later tested positive for covid-19.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-54956076|title=Covid-19: Boris Johnson and six Tory MPs self-isolating after No 10 meeting|work=BBC News|date=17 November 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.sky.com/story/self-isolating-boris-johnson-not-held-back-by-virtual-pmqs-but-still-gets-told-off-12135634|title=Self-isolating Boris Johnson not held back by virtual PMQs - but still gets told off|work=Sky News|date=18 November 2020|first=Aubrey|last=Allegretti}}</ref>

During the [[Cameron–Clegg coalition]], [[Nick Clegg]] answered 15 PMQs and [[William Hague]] twice, opposite [[Harriet Harman]].{{efn|20 June 2012 and 10 September 2014}}<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00sxprs/episodes/guide?page=1|website=BBC|title=Deputy Prime Minister's Questions|access-date=2018-09-16}}</ref> During the [[Second Cameron ministry]], [[George Osborne]] answered thrice, opposite [[Angela Eagle]].{{efn|17 June 2015, 9 December 2015 and 25 May 2016}}<ref name="YouTube UK Parliament">{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/user/UKParliament/videos|title=UK Parliament|website=YouTube|access-date=2018-09-16}}</ref> In the [[Second May ministry]], [[Damian Green]] replied twice,{{efn|12 July 2017 and 29 November 2017}} opposite [[Emily Thornberry]], while [[David Lidington]] did so six times, opposite Thornberry and [[Rebecca Long-Bailey]].{{efn|7 December 2016, 31 January 2018, 11 July 2018, 6 February 2019, 24 April 2019 and 5 June 2019}}<ref name="YouTube UK Parliament" /> On 2 October 2019, [[Diane Abbott]] became the first black MP to stand for PMQS and ask the six main questions when she challenged the [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]], [[Dominic Raab]], in his capacity as [[First Secretary of State|First Secretary]].

== Leaders at the dispatch box since 1961 ==
The most high-profile contributors at Prime Minister's questions are the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition, who speak opposite each other at the [[despatch box|dispatch box]]. Regular, fixed sessions have taken place since 1961, and the list below outlines the prime ministers since 1961 and Opposition party leaders they faced across the floor of the House of Commons, as well as the secondary opposition leader since 1997 (usually the leader of third largest party within the House of Commons):
