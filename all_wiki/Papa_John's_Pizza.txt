==History==
[[File:Papa John's Pizza logo.svg|thumb|Previous logo]]
The Papa John's restaurant was founded in 1984 when "Papa" [[John Schnatter]] knocked out a broom closet in the back of his father's tavern, Mick's Lounge, in [[Jeffersonville, Indiana]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Wolfson|first1=Andrew|title=The real Papa John: Pizza entrepreneur John Schnatter makes no apologies for wealth, success, Obamacare remarks {{!}} Math whiz mixed pizza passion, finance |url=https://www.courier-journal.com/story/money/2013/01/13/the-real-papa-john-pizza-entrepreneur-john-schnatter-m/28936389/ |accessdate=March 22, 2017 |work=[[The Courier-Journal]]|date=January 13, 2013}}</ref> He then sold his [[Chevrolet Camaro (second generation)|1971 Camaro Z28]] to purchase [[US$]]1,600 worth of used pizza equipment and began selling pizzas to the tavern's customers out of the converted closet.<ref name="PJStory" /> His pizzas proved sufficiently popular that a year later he moved into an adjoining space.

On July 11, 2018, news outlets reported that during a conference call with Papa Johns' marketing agency Laundry Service, Schnatter had used the word "nigger" by saying "[[Colonel Sanders]] called blacks niggers and Sanders never faced public backlash." Schnatter alleged that referencing the quote by the [[KFC]] founder was meant to convey his dislike for racism.<ref>{{cite news |first=Noah|last=Kirsch |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/noahkirsch/2018/07/11/papa-johns-founder-john-schnatter-allegedly-used-n-word-on-conference-call/ |title=Papa John's Founder Used N-Word On Conference Call|work=[[Forbes]]|publisher=[[Forbes Media]]|location=New York City|date=July 11, 2018}}</ref> After the call, the owner of the marketing agency moved to end their contract with Papa John's.

On July 26, 2018, [[John Schnatter]] filed a [[lawsuit]] against Papa John's Pizza to give him access to the company's [[financial statements|books]] and records after they fired him from the company after the teleconference call scandal. He describes the company's procedures as an "unexplained and heavy-handed way" to cut ties between him and the company that he founded. In addition to preventing him from accessing information, the corporation has also implemented a [[Shareholder rights plan|poison pill strategy]] in order to limit Schnatter's chances of buying back a [[majority stake]] in the company.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jul/26/papa-john-schnatter-lawsuit-racial-slur |title='Papa John' files lawsuit against Papa John's pizza chain |date=July 26, 2018 |newspaper=[[The Guardian]]}}</ref>

==Litigation==
In 1997, [[Pizza Hut]] filed a lawsuit against Papa John's based on a series of advertisements that compared the ingredients of Papa John's and its competitors. Pizza Hut successfully argued that Papa John's slogan did not constitute statements of literal fact – that "fresher ingredients" do not necessarily account for a "better" pizza. This ruling was overturned in 2000 when Papa John's appealed the decision. Although the jury's decision on the misleading advertising was upheld, the appeals court determined that Pizza Hut failed to prove, under the requirements of the [[Lanham Act]], that the misleading advertising and [[puffery]] had a material effect on consumers' purchasing decisions.

In 2012, the company was the subject of a [[class action|class-action lawsuit]] for allegedly sending over 500,000 unwanted text messages to customers.<ref name="latimes 2012">{{cite news| last= Hsu| first=Tiffany| title=Papa John's faces $250-million class action spam lawsuit | work=[[Los Angeles Times]] | date=14 November 2012 | url=http://articles.latimes.com/2012/nov/14/business/la-fi-mo-papa-johns-spam-lawsuit-appreciation-20121114 | access-date=15 March 2019}}</ref> The suit sought over $250 million in damages, though the company settled to pay $16.5 million, awarding claimants up to $50 in damages, and a free, large, one-topping pizza.<ref>{{cite news |title=Papa John's Agrees to $16.5M Text Spam Class Action Settlement |first=Sarah |last=Mirando |date=May 20, 2013 |work=Top Class Actions |url=http://www.topclassactions.com/lawsuit-settlements/lawsuit-news/4146-papa-john-s-agrees-to-16-5m-text-spam-class-action-settlement |accessdate=January 17, 2015}}</ref>

In August 2015, Papa John's agreed to pay $12.3 million to settle a class-action lawsuit in which the company was accused of undercompensating 19,000 delivery drivers in the states of [[Arizona]], [[Florida]], [[Illinois]], [[Maryland]], [[Missouri]] and [[North Carolina]].
