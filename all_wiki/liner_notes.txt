'''Liner notes''' (also '''sleeve notes''' or '''album notes''') are the writings found on the sleeves of [[LP record]] albums and in booklets which come inserted into the [[compact disc]] [[jewel case]] or the equivalent packaging for vinyl records and cassettes.

==Origin==
Liner notes are descended from the program notes for musical concerts, and developed into notes that were printed on the inner sleeve used to protect a traditional 12-inch vinyl record, i.e., [[long playing]] or [[gramophone record]] [[album]]. The term descends from the name "record liner" or "[[album liner]]". Album liner notes survived format changes from vinyl LP to cassette to CD.<ref>Dean Biron, Writing and Music: Album Liner Notes, ''Portal: International Journal of Multidisciplinary Studies'' (Vol 8, No 1), 2011.</ref>  These notes can be sources of information about the contents of the recording as well as broader cultural topics.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Designed for Hi-Fi LIving: The Vinyl LP in Midcentury America|last=Borgerson|first=Janet|last2=Schroeder|first2=Jonathan|publisher=MIT Press|year=2017|isbn=978-0262036238|location=Cambridge, MA}}</ref>

==Contents==

===Common material===
Such notes often contained a mix of factual and anecdotal material, and occasionally a [[discography]] for the artist or the issuing [[record label]]. Liner notes were also an occasion for thoughtful signed essays on the artist by another party, often a sympathetic [[music journalist]], a custom that has largely died out. However, the liner note ''essay'' has survived in retrospective compilations, particularly in box sets. It is also a tradition in Japan, especially for foreign artist releases. Many CD liner notes include complete song lyrics for the album.

===Biographies===
Liner notes now usually include [[information]] about the [[musician]], [[lyrics]], a personnel list, and other [[credit (creative arts)|credits]] to people the musicians want to thank and people or [[record label|companies]] involved in the [[Record producer|production]] of the [[music]]. They also can give details on the extent of each musical piece, and sometimes place them in historical or social context.  Liner notes for [[European Classical Music|classical music]] recordings often provide information in several languages; if the piece includes vocal parts, they will often include a [[libretto]], possibly also translated into several languages.

===Metadata===
Liner notes sometimes provide [[metadata]] that can help when cataloguing private or public collections of sound recordings. However, the information provided on liner notes varies considerably depending on the studio or label which produced the record.

==Digital liner notes==
Increasingly and due to the rise of digital downloads, a [[digital booklet]] is being introduced to compensate for the lack of a physical booklet. [[Apple Inc.]] also introduced [[iTunes LP]] which features interactive menus instead of simple pages.

==Awards==
A [[Grammy Award for Best Album Notes]] has been given annually since 1964.
