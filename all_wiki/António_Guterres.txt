'''António Manuel de Oliveira Guterres''' {{Post-nominals|list=[[Order of Christ (Portugal)|GCC]] [[Order of Liberty|GCL]]}} ({{IPAc-en|g|ʊ|ˈ|t|ɛr|ə|s}}; {{IPA-pt|ɐ̃ˈtɔnju ɡuˈtɛʁɨʃ|eu}}; born 30 April 1949) is a [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] politician and diplomat serving as the ninth [[secretary-general of the United Nations]]. A member of the [[Socialist Party (Portugal)|Portuguese Socialist Party]], he served as [[prime minister of Portugal]] from 1995 to 2002.

Guterres served as secretary-general of the [[Socialist Party (Portugal)|Socialist Party]] from 1992 to 2002. He was elected [[List of Prime Ministers of Portugal|prime minister of Portugal]] in 1995 and resigned in 2002 after the Socialist Party was defeated in the [[2001 Portuguese local elections]]. After six years governing without an absolute majority and with a bad economy, the Socialist Party did worse than expected because of losses in Lisbon and Porto, where polls showed it with a solid lead. [[Eduardo Ferro Rodrigues]] assumed the Socialist Party leadership, but the [[2002 Portuguese legislative election|general election]] was lost to the [[Social Democratic Party (Portugal)|Social Democratic Party]], led by [[José Manuel Barroso]].

Guterres served as president of the [[Socialist International]] from 1999 to 2005.

==Early life==
Guterres was born and raised in [[Lisbon]], [[Portugal]], the son of Virgílio Dias Guterres (1913–2009) and Ilda Cândida de Oliveira (born 1923).

He attended the Camões [[Lyceum]] (now [[Camões Secondary School]]), where he graduated in 1965, winning the National Lyceums Award (''Prémio Nacional dos Liceus'') as the best student in the country. He studied physics and electrical engineering at [[Instituto Superior Técnico]] – [[University of Lisbon]] in Lisbon. He graduated in 1971 and started an academic career as an assistant professor teaching systems theory and telecommunications signals, before leaving academic life to start a political career.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://24.sapo.pt/article/sapo24-blogs-sapo-pt_2016_02_02_1858416979_antonio-guterres--catolico--socialista-e-politico-por-acrescimo|title=António Guterres: católico, socialista e político por acréscimo - Atualidade - SAPO 24|last=SAPO|work=sapo.pt|access-date=15 October 2016|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161011064325/http://24.sapo.pt/article/sapo24-blogs-sapo-pt_2016_02_02_1858416979_antonio-guterres--catolico--socialista-e-politico-por-acrescimo|archive-date=11 October 2016|df=dmy-all|language=pt}}</ref>

==Political career==
Guterres's political career began in 1974, when he became a member of the [[Socialist Party (Portugal)|Socialist Party]]. Shortly thereafter, he quit academic life and became a full-time politician. In the period following the [[Carnation Revolution]] of 25 April 1974 that put an end to [[Marcelo Caetano#Prime minister|Caetano's dictatorship]], Guterres became involved in Socialist Party leadership and held the following offices:

* Leader of the parliamentary bench of the Socialist Party, succeeding [[Jorge Sampaio]] (1988){{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}

Guterres was a member of the team that negotiated the terms of Portugal's entry into the [[European Union]] in the late 1970s.<ref>[http://www.politico.eu/article/master-of-dialogue/ Master of dialogue] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161021120625/http://www.politico.eu/article/master-of-dialogue/ |date=21 October 2016 }} ''[[European Voice]]'', 5 January 2000.</ref> He was a founding member of the Portuguese Refugee Council in 1991.<ref name="nytimes.com">{{cite news|first=Warren|last=Hoge|date=May 25, 2005|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/25/world/former-portuguese-premier-chosen-to-lead-un-refugee-agency.html|title=Former Portuguese Premier Chosen to Lead U.N.

His election represented a break with tradition for the Socialists: not only was Guterres not associated with either the faction around then-president and former prime minister [[Mário Soares]] or the party's left wing led by Guterres's predecessor Sampaio, but he was also a devout Catholic, running counter to the party's historical secularism. He consulted with Portugal's civil society in formulating policy, meeting a range of intellectuals, scientists and entrepreneurs from across the country and the political spectrum in the run-up to the next general election.<ref name=ecpr />

===Prime Minister of Portugal===
[[Aníbal Cavaco Silva]] did not seek a fourth term as prime minister of Portugal (in order to run for the [[1996 Portuguese presidential election|1996 Presidential election]]) and the Socialist Party won the [[1995 Portuguese legislative election|1995 parliamentary election]]. President Soares appointed Guterres as prime minister<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Antonio-Guterres|title=António Guterres {{!}} Biography|work=[[Encyclopedia Britannica]]|access-date=November 20, 2018|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181120182141/https://www.britannica.com/biography/Antonio-Guterres|archive-date=20 November 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> and his Cabinet took the oath of office on 28 October that year.

Guterres ran on a platform of keeping a tight hold on budget spending and inflation in a bid to ensure that Portugal met the [[Euro convergence criteria]] by the end of the decade, as well as increasing rates of participation in the labor market, especially among women, improving tax collection and cracking down on tax evasion, increased involvement of the [[Mutualism (movement)|mutual]] and [[Voluntary sector|nonprofit]] sectors in providing welfare services, a means-tested [[guaranteed minimum income]] (known as the ''Rendimento Minimo Garantido''), and increased investment in education.<ref name=ecpr /> He was then one of seven Social Democratic prime ministers in the [[European Union]], joining political allies in Spain, Denmark, Finland, Sweden, Greece and the Netherlands.<ref>{{cite journal|first=Rory|last=Watson|date=October 4, 1995|url=http://www.politico.eu/article/socialists-prepare-to-govern/|title=Socialists prepare to govern|journal=[[European Voice]]|access-date=15 October 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161021115112/http://www.politico.eu/article/socialists-prepare-to-govern/|archive-date=21 October 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>

====First term (1995–1999)====

With a style markedly different from that of his predecessor, and based on dialogue and discussion with all sections of society, Guterres was a popular prime minister in his first years in office. Portugal was enjoying an economic expansion that allowed the Socialists to reduce budget deficits while increasing welfare spending and creating new [[conditional cash transfer]] programs.<ref name="ft.com">{{cite magazine|first=Peter|last=Wise|date=October 6, 2016|url=https://www.ft.com/content/43ff2174-8bc7-11e6-8aa5-f79f5696c731|title=5 things to know: Portuguese who said no to EU but yes to UN|magazine=[[Financial Times]]|publisher=[[Nikkei, Inc.]]|location=London, England|access-date=18 October 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171222052351/https://www.ft.com/content/43ff2174-8bc7-11e6-8aa5-f79f5696c731|archive-date=22 December 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> His government also accelerated the program of privatizations that Cavaco Silva's government had begun: 29 companies were privatized between 1996 and 1999, with proceeds from privatizations in 1996–97 greater than those of the previous six years, and the public sector's share of GDP halved from 11% in 1994 to 5.5% five years later. Share ownership was also widened, with 800,000 people investing in [[Portugal Telecom]] upon its privatization in 1996 and 750,000 applying for shares in [[Electricidade de Portugal]].<ref name=ecpr />

In 1998, Guterres presided over [[Expo 98]] in Lisbon, commemorating the 500th anniversary of the voyage of [[Vasco da Gama]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.economist.com/node/249433|title=Antonio Guterres, a Portuguese on the move|date=14 October 1999|magazine=[[The Economist]]|publisher=[[Economist Group]]|location=London, England|access-date=15 October 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161018211632/http://www.economist.com/node/249433|archive-date=18 October 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> Also in 1998, two nationwide referenda were held. The [[1998 Portuguese abortion referendum|first one]] was held in June and asked voters whether [[Abortion in Portugal|abortion]] rules should be liberalized. The Socialist Party split over the issue of liberalization, and Guterres led the pro-life side, which eventually won the referendum.<ref name="ft.com"/> A [[1998 Portuguese regionalisation referendum|second referendum]] was held in November, this time over the regionalization of the [[Mainland Portugal|mainland]]. Both Guterres and his party supported such an administrative reform, but the voters rejected it.

Contrary to his party stance and following the removal of [[homosexuality]] from the list of mental illnesses by the [[World Health Organization]] in 1990, Guterres said, in 1995, that "he did not like homosexuality" and that it was "something that bothered him".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jn.pt/domingo/interior/a-longa-marcha-dos-direitos-homossexuais-1576266.html|title=A longa marcha dos direitos homossexuais|author=Nuno Miguel Ropio|date=23 May 2010|access-date=27 October 2016|via=Jornal de Notícias|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161027193447/http://www.jn.pt/domingo/interior/a-longa-marcha-dos-direitos-homossexuais-1576266.html|archive-date=27 October 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>

[[File:António Guterres.jpg|thumb|right|150px|António Guterres in 2003]]
On foreign policy, Guterres campaigned for United Nations intervention in [[East Timor]] in 1999, after it was virtually destroyed by Indonesian-backed militias when [[1999 East Timorese independence referendum|it voted for independence]].<ref name="nytimes.com"/> He also finalized the 12-year negotiations on the [[transfer of sovereignty over Macau]], which had been a [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese colony]], to Chinese control in 1999.<ref name="Somini Sengupta 2016">Somini Sengupta (13 October 2016),  [https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/14/world/americas/united-nations-un-antonio-guterres.html António Guterres, Known for Nerve and Deal Making, Will Need Both at U.N.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161215225202/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/14/world/americas/united-nations-un-antonio-guterres.html |date=15 December 2016 }} ''The New York Times''</ref>

====Second term (1999–2002)====
In the [[1999 Portuguese legislative election|1999 parliamentary election]] the Socialist Party and the opposition won exactly the same number of MPs (115). Guterres was reappointed to office and from January to July 2000 occupied the six-month rotating presidency of the [[European Council]]. His second term in government was not as successful, however. Internal party conflicts, an economic slowdown, and the [[Hintze Ribeiro disaster|Hintze Ribeiro Bridge disaster]] damaged his authority and popularity. Nevertheless, some long-lasting measures were taken during his second term: in October 2000, the Parliament approved the [[Drug policy of Portugal|decriminalization of drug use]] (effective 1 July 2001)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sicad.pt/BK/Institucional/Legislacao/Lists/SICAD_LEGISLACAO/Attachments/525/lei_30_2000.pdf|title=Lei n.º 30/2000, de 29 de Novembro|date=29 November 2000|access-date=19 October 2016|language=pt|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220201802/http://www.sicad.pt/BK/Institucional/Legislacao/Lists/SICAD_LEGISLACAO/Attachments/525/lei_30_2000.pdf|archive-date=20 December 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> and in March 2001, same-sex [[civil unions]] were legalized.<ref name="Somini Sengupta 2016"/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://dre.pt/application/dir/pdf1sdip/2001/05/109A00/27972798.pdf|title=Lei n.º 7/2001, de 11 de Maio|date=7 May 2001|access-date=18 October 2016|language=pt|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180820234847/https://dre.pt/application/dir/pdf1sdip/2001/05/109A00/27972798.pdf|archive-date=20 August 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

In December 2001, following a disastrous defeat for the Socialist Party in local elections, Guterres resigned<ref name=":0" /> to "prevent the country from falling into a political swamp".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/01/will-antonio-guterres-be-the-uns-best-ever-secretary-general|title=Will António Guterres be the UN's best ever secretary general?|last1=Chrisafis|first1=Angelique|last2=Borger|first2=Julian|date=2017-01-01|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-11-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181120180242/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/01/will-antonio-guterres-be-the-uns-best-ever-secretary-general|archive-date=20 November 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> President [[Jorge Sampaio]] dissolved Parliament and called for elections. [[Eduardo Ferro Rodrigues]], until then Minister for Social Security, assumed the Socialist Party leadership, but the [[2002 Portuguese legislative election|general election]] was lost to the [[Social Democratic Party (Portugal)|Social Democratic Party]] of [[José Manuel Durão Barroso]], who later became [[President of the European Commission]].

===President of Socialist International===

Guterres was elected president of [[Socialist International]] in November 1999,<ref name=si_meeting/> overlapping with his second term as prime minister of Portugal until his resignation from the latter post in December 2001. He remained president of the Socialist International until June 2005.<ref name=si_meeting/>

==Diplomatic career==
In 2005, following Guterres's proposal, [[George Papandreou]] was elected vice president of the [[Socialist International]]; in 2006, Papandreou succeeded him as president of the Socialist International.

In May 2005, Guterres was elected [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees|High Commissioner for Refugees]] for a five-year term by the UN General Assembly, replacing [[Ruud Lubbers]].<ref>Warren Hoge (25 May 2005), [https://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/25/world/former-portuguese-premier-chosen-to-lead-un-refugee-agency.html Former Portuguese Premier Chosen to Lead U.N.

In a February 2007 [[NPR]] interview devoted mainly to the plight of Iraqi refugees, Guterres said that this was one of the greatest refugee crises in the Middle East since 1948.

The UN's role in the [[2010–13 Haiti cholera outbreak|Haiti cholera outbreak]] was widely discussed and criticized<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ijdh.org/advocacies/our-work/cholera-advocacy/|title=Advocacy Cholera Accountability|access-date=27 June 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160707173825/http://www.ijdh.org/advocacies/our-work/cholera-advocacy/|archive-date=7 July 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> after the Ban Ki-moon administration denied the issue for several months. According to the Boston-based [[Institute for Justice & Democracy in Haiti]] as well as numerous conclusive scientific studies, the UN is the proximate cause for bringing cholera to Haiti. Peacekeepers sent to Haiti from Nepal in 2010 were carrying asymptomatic cholera and failed to treat their waste properly before dumping it into one of Haiti's main water streams.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ijdh.org/advocacies/our-work/cholera-advocacy/|title=Advocacy Cholera Accountability|publisher=IJDH|access-date=5 October 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160707173825/http://www.ijdh.org/advocacies/our-work/cholera-advocacy/|archive-date=7 July 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> During his UNSG informal dialogue, Jamaica, on behalf of the Caribbean Community, asked if the UN should assume liability for any deaths within local populations that result from the introduction of infectious disease by its peacekeepers.

"All of us together—states and UN—must do our utmost to ensure that any kind of action of this type is severely punished," he said.<ref name="webtv.un.org"/> The United States raised the question of international tribunals to try peacekeepers for their crimes. Guterres responded by saying an independent jurisdiction would be excellent but that "the only way to get there is through a new compact with all key parties—true contributors, financial contributors—and to make sure that there is an adjustment in the relation between countries, the UN, and the support those that are contributing with troops receive, in order to be able to do it much better."<ref name="webtv.un.org"/> He also indicated that there is a gap between theoretical zero tolerance and the ineffective zero tolerance that actually exists on the ground and needs to be overcome.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}
