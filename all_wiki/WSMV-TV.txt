'''WSMV-TV''', [[virtual channel]] 4 ([[very high frequency|VHF]] [[digital terrestrial television|digital]] channel 10), is an [[NBC]]-[[network affiliate|affiliated]] [[television station]] [[city of license|licensed]] to [[Nashville, Tennessee]], United States. The station is owned by the Meredith Local Media subsidiary of [[Des Moines, Iowa]]-based [[Meredith Corporation]]. WSMV's studios and transmitter are located on Knob Road in West Nashville.

==History==

===Early years===
WSMV first signed on the air as '''WSM-TV''' on September 30, 1950, at 1:10&nbsp;p.m. It was Nashville's first television station and the second in Tennessee, behind fellow NBC affiliate WMCT (now [[WMC-TV]], then also on channel 4) in [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]]. As a result of the WSM-TV sign-on, WMCT was forced to switch to channel 5 to avoid co-channel interference. WSM-TV was owned by WSM, Inc., a subsidiary of the locally based [[National Life and Accident Insurance Company]], which also owned WSM radio ([[WSM (AM)|650 AM]] and [[WSM-FM|95.5 FM]]); the AM station is renowned for broadcasts of the [[country music]] show ''The [[Grand Ole Opry]]'', which has been heard on the station since 1925. The station took its call letters from its parent's slogan, "<u>W</u>e <u>S</u>hield <u>M</u>illions."

The television station has been an NBC affiliate from its sign-on, although it also carried some programming from [[CBS]], [[DuMont Television Network|DuMont]], and [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]. Its secondary affiliation with CBS ended in 1953, when WSIX-TV (channel 8, now [[WKRN-TV]] on channel 2) signed on as a primary CBS affiliate. WSM-TV shared ABC programming with WSIX-TV for a year until WLAC-TV (channel 5, now [[WTVF]]) signed on in 1954 as the market's new primary CBS affiliate, leaving WSIX-TV to take the ABC affiliation. During the first few years of operation, [[AT&T]] would not run telephone lines for WSM-TV to receive network programming until there was another TV station in town. This problem was solved by the station running a private microwave relay transmission from fellow NBC affiliate [[WAVE (TV)|WAVE-TV]] in [[Louisville, Kentucky]].

===Growth into the 1960s and 1970s===
WSM-TV's studios were originally located at 15th Avenue South and Compton Avenue in south Nashville, near the present [[Belmont University]]. In 1957, the station attempted to a build a larger tower in west Nashville, near Charlotte Avenue. During the construction process, the new tower's supporting wires failed. This caused the tower to collapse, which took the lives of several people. Afterward, WSM-TV purchased its present property on Knob Road (farther west than the previous site, and allowable since WMCT, Memphis had switched to Channel 5 from Channel 4) and built a tower there in a forested section away from potential damage to life and property.

WSM-TV shared its broadcast facilities with [[non-commercial educational station|non-commercial station]] WDCN-TV (channel 2, now [[WNPT (TV)|WNPT]] on channel 8) beginning in 1962. In 1963, National Life and Accident Insurance built new studios for WSM-AM-FM-TV adjacent to the transmission tower on Knob Road. This left WDCN-TV as the sole occupant of the south Nashville building, where that station remained until 1976. In 1974, NL&AI reorganized itself as a [[holding company]], NLT Corporation, with the WSM stations as a major subsidiary.

===Ownership changes===
Beginning in 1980, [[Houston]]-based insurer [[American International Group|American General]]–which owned the WLAC stations until 1975–began purchasing blocks of NLT stock, eventually becoming NLT's largest shareholder and setting the stage for an outright takeover. However, American General was not interested in NLT's non-insurance businesses. It opted to sell off the broadcasting interests, the Grand Ole Opry, the then-decrepit [[Ryman Auditorium]], and [[Opryland USA]]. Gillett Broadcasting (operated by [[George N. Gillett Jr.]]) bought WSM-TV on November 3, 1981, and changed the station's callsign to '''WSMV''' on the same day (officially modified to '''WSMV-TV''' on July 15, 1982).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://licensing.fcc.gov/cgi-bin/ws.exe/prod/cdbs/pubacc/prod/call_hist.pl?Facility_id=41232&Callsign=WSMV-TV |title=WSMV-TV Call Sign History |publisher=Federal Communications Commission |accessdate=August 19, 2014}}</ref> The new callsign allowed channel 4 to continue trading on the well-known WSM calls while at the same time separating it from its former radio sisters. The change was brought on due to an FCC rule in place at that time forbidding TV and radio stations in the same city but with different owners from sharing the same call letters. However, channel 4 would later engage in news department cross promotions with WSM-AM-FM.

[[Ryman Hospitality Properties|Gaylord Entertainment Company]] purchased the remainder of WSM, Inc. nearly two years later, in 1983. Soon afterward, the radio stations moved out of the Knob Road facility into new studios on the [[Opryland Hotel]] campus.

WSMV-TV was sold on June 8, 1989, to Cook Inlet Television Partners, an [[Alaska]]-based company which was a subsidiary of [[Cook Inlet Region, Inc.]], an [[Alaska Native Regional Corporation]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/02/10/business/the-media-business-wsmv-tv-is-to-be-sold.html |department=The Media Business |title=WSMV-TV Is to Be Sold |work=[[The New York Times]] |agency=Associated Press |volume=138 |issue=47777 |page=D17 |date=February 10, 1989}}

===Meredith Corporation ownership===
[[File:WSMV-TV 4 logo.png|thumb|right|WSMV's former logo, variations of which have been used since its introduction in 1978. This particular variation was first seen in 1994 and would be used until May 2020, when the golden 4 would be retired. The new 4 logotype is solid white or black, depending on the background contrast.]]

Cook Inlet sold WSMV on January 5, 1995, to the [[Meredith Corporation]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/20/business/company-news-meredith-to-acquire-tv-station-from-cook-inlet.html |department=Company News |title=Meredith to Acquire TV Station From Cook Inlet |work=[[The New York Times]] |agency=Bloomberg News |volume=143 |issue=49794 |page=39 |date=August 20, 1994}}</ref> WSMV was not part of the affiliation deal between several Meredith stations and CBS (however, Meredith's only other NBC affiliate at the time, [[WNEM-TV]] in [[Bay City, Michigan]], was) because the purchase was announced seven months after the affiliation deal had been finalized. As a result, WSMV became the only NBC affiliate in Meredith's present-day station group.

In early March 2009, it was announced that WSMV's master control operations would be hubbed at Meredith-owned sister station [[WGCL-TV]] in [[Atlanta]]. The new hub operation launched in summer 2009.

On September 8, 2015, [[Media General]] announced that it would acquire Meredith for $2.4 billion, with the combined group to be renamed Meredith Media General. Because Media General owned WKRN-TV, and the two stations rank among the four highest-rated stations in the Nashville market in total day viewership, the companies would have been required to sell either WSMV-TV or WKRN to comply with FCC ownership rules as well as recent changes to those rules regarding same-market television stations that restrict [[local marketing agreement|sharing agreements]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.tvnewscheck.com/article/88230/media-general-acquiring-meredith-for-24b |title=Media General Acquiring Meredith For 2.4 Billion |website=TVNewsCheck |publisher=NewsCheck Media |date=September 8, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://variety.com/2015/tv/news/tv-station-meredith-media-general-merger-1201587744/ |title=TV Station Mega Merger: Media General Sets $2.4 Billion Acquisition of Meredith Corp. |periodical=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |first=Cynthia |last=Littleton |date=September 8, 2015 |accessdate=September 9, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite press release |url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/media-general-meredith-to-combine-to-create-meredith-media-general-a-new-powerful-multiplatform-and-diversified-media-company-300138841.html |title=Media General, Meredith To Combine To Create Meredith Media General: A New Powerful Multiplatform And Diversified Media Company |agency=[[PR Newswire]] |publisher=[[Meredith Corporation]] |date=September 8, 2015}}</ref> On January 27, 2016, [[Nexstar Media Group|Nexstar Broadcasting Group]] announced that it had reached an agreement to acquire Media General.

==Subchannels==
===WSMV-DT2===
'''WSMV-DT2''' is the [[Escape (TV network)|Escape]]-affiliated second digital subchannel of WSMV-TV, broadcasting in [[16:9]] [[widescreen]] [[standard-definition television|standard definition]] on VHF channel 10.2 (or virtual channel 4.2 via PSIP).

====As Telemundo Nashville====
The subchannel launched in the summer of 2006 as an affiliate of NBC-owned [[Spanish language in the United States|Spanish-language]] television network [[Telemundo]] since the Nashville market lacked a standalone Telemundo affiliate of its own. The second subchannel was branded as Telemundo Nashville. The subchannel went defunct on December 31, 2010, leaving Nashville with only one Spanish-language television station, [[WLLC-LP]] (Channel 42), the area’s Telefutura (now [[UniMás]]) outlet. (WLLC-LP has since added [[Univision]] as their primary affiliation on 42.1, with UniMás moving to 42.2.) The subchannel's spectrum would be used for purposes other than over-the-air broadcasting once the subchannel went dark.

====As The Nashville Network/Heartland====
WSMV-DT2 relaunched on November 1, 2012 when it became the flagship station of the new re-incarnation of [[The Nashville Network]]. This move reflected the history of [[WSM (AM)|WSM radio]], the former radio sister of WSMV, as it was one of the original founders of the original pay-TV-exclusive TNN when it launched in 1983.<ref name=tnn12>{{cite press release |url=http://www.prweb.com/releases/2012/10/prweb10068084.htm |title=Nashville's WSMV Named Flagship Affiliate For The Nashville Network |agency=PRWeb |date=October 29, 2012}}</ref> The network was renamed [[Heartland (TV network)|Heartland]] in October 2013.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wsmv.com/category/250310/wsmv-tnn |title=WSMV 4.2 - The Heartland Network - WSMV Channel 4 |publisher=WSMV |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140822083151/http://www.wsmv.com/category/250310/wsmv-tnn |archivedate=August 22, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://nashvilledtvnews.info/post/TNN_is_Now_Heartland |title=TNN is Now Heartland |website=NashvilleTVNews.info |publisher=Nashville DTV News |date=October 16, 2013 |accessdate=August 3, 2020}}</ref> WSMV-DT2 continued to serve as the flagship station of Heartland, with some of the operations of the network still based in Nashville, while the rest of the operations were based in Chattanooga, Tennessee (where Heartland's owner, [[Luken Communications]], has their headquarters).

====As Escape/Court TV Mystery====
On November 1, 2016, WSMV's contract with Luken Communications to carry Heartland expired, and Heartland was replaced by Escape, a television channel aimed towards a female audience; the channel also shows crime drama programs & movies aimed towards women. WSMV-DT2 has cleared all of Escape's programming since the switch occurred. Escape can also be seen on [[Charter Communications]] [[cable television|cable]] channel 180, and [[Xfinity|Comcast Xfinity]] cable channel 230. The name changed to Court TV Mystery on September 29, 2019.

===WSMV-DT3===
'''WSMV-DT3''' is the [[Cozi TV]]-affiliated third digital subchannel of WSMV-TV, broadcasting in 16:9 widescreen standard definition on VHF channel 10.3 (or virtual channel 4.3 via PSIP).

On March 23, 2015, the Web site TVNewsCheck.com reported that eight stations owned by Meredith Corp. had reached an agreement to add the [[NBCUniversal]]-owned Cozi TV to their multicast channels.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://tvnewscheck.com/article/83934/cozi-tv-diginet-adds-eight-stations/ |title=Cozi TV Diginet Adds Eight Stations |work=TVNewsCheck |date=March 23, 2015}}</ref> Included in the list of stations was WSMV. The Web site Rabbitears.info indicates that WSMV is broadcasting Cozi TV on the DT3 subchannel, which began broadcasting on May 28, 2015.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rabbitears.info/market.php?request=print_station&facility_id=41232 |title=WSMV-TV Nashville, TN |website=RabbitEars.info}}</ref>

===WSMV-DT4===
'''WSMV-DT4''' is the [[Court TV]]-affiliated fourth digital subchannel of WSMV-TV, broadcasting in 16:9 widescreen standard definition on VHF channel 10.4 (or virtual channel 4.4 via PSIP).

On May 9, 2019, WSMV signed on a fourth subchannel to carry the recently relaunched Court TV.

===WSMV-DT5===
'''WSMV-DT5''' is the [[Circle (TV network)|Circle]]-affiliated fifth digital subchannel of WSMV-TV, broadcasting in 16:9 widescreen standard definition on VHF channel 10.5 (or virtual channel 4.5 via PSIP).

In January 2020, WSMV signed on a fifth subchannel to carry the country music and lifestyle multicast network Circle, a joint venture of [[Gray Television]] and Opry Entertainment Group.

===Analog-to-digital conversion===
WSMV-TV shut down its analog signal, over [[Very high frequency|VHF]] channel 4, on June 12, 2009, the official date in which full-power television stations in the United States [[Digital television transition in the United States|transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts]] under federal mandate. The station's digital signal remained on its pre-transition VHF channel 10.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://hraunfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DA-06-1082A2.pdf |title=DTV Tentative Channel Designations for the First and Second Rounds |publisher=Federal Communications Commission |accessdate=March 24, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130829004251/http://hraunfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DA-06-1082A2.pdf |archivedate=August 29, 2013}}</ref><ref name="FCCForm387">{{cite web |url=https://licensing.fcc.gov/cgi-bin/ws.exe/prod/cdbs/forms/prod/cdbsmenu.hts?context=25&appn=101231951&formid=387&fac_num=41232 |title=DTV Transition Status Report |publisher=Federal Communications Commission |date=February 4, 2008 |accessdate=July 1, 2008}}</ref> Through the use of [[Program and System Information Protocol|PSIP]], digital television receivers display the station's [[virtual channel]] as its former VHF analog channel 4.

==Programming==
In addition to the NBC network schedule, [[Broadcast syndication|syndicated]] programs on WSMV include ''[[Tamron Hall (talk show)|Tamron Hall]]'', ''[[Rachael Ray (talk show)|Rachael Ray]]'' and ''[[Access Hollywood]]'', among others.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tvlistings.zap2it.com/tvlistings/ZCSGrid.do?stnNum=32685&channel=4.1&aid=zap2it |title=WSMVDT (WSMV-DT) TV Listings, TV Shows, and Schedule |website=Zap2It.com |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160821200944/http://tvlistings.zap2it.com/tvlistings/ZCSGrid.do?stnNum=32685&channel=4.1&aid=zap2it |archivedate=August 21, 2016}}</ref>

===Country music programming===
The WSM stations' close ties to Nashville's country music business has meant that the Knob Road facility and/or its personnel was, from time to time, used for the recording of network and syndicated programs featuring Nashville-based performers. This was especially the case during the 1960s and 1970s. Most if not all of these shows were packaged by Show Biz, Inc., headquartered in Nashville and a subsidiary of [[Holiday Inn]]. Show Biz, Inc. produced ''The [[Porter Wagoner]] Show'', ''[[That Nashville Music]]'', ''The [[Bill Anderson (singer)|Bill Anderson]] Show'', ''[[Dolly!]]'' and several other programs seen throughout the U.S., especially on stations in the [[Southern United States|Southern]] and rural [[Midwestern United States|Midwestern U.S.]] The company dissolved in the late 1970s when its president, Jane Grams, became vice president and general manager of [[WTVC-TV]] in [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]]. However, the Show Biz programs were seen on some stations well into the early 1980s.

===Sports programming===
Since 2006, channel 4 airs any ''[[NBC Sunday Night Football|Sunday Night Football]]'' games that involve the market's [[National Football League|NFL]] team, the [[Tennessee Titans]]. The station also airs [[Nashville Predators]] games via [[NHL on NBC|NBC]]'s broadcast contract with the [[National Hockey League|NHL]]; this includes the team's appearance in the [[2017 Stanley Cup Final]].

From 1987 until March 2002, WSMV-TV was the Nashville home to syndicated [[Southeastern Conference]] [[college football|football]] and men's [[college basketball|basketball]] games originating from [[Jefferson Pilot Sports]], but sharing some broadcasts with WXMT (channel 30, now [[MyNetworkTV]] affiliate [[WUXP]]).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://raycomsports.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/SECslick.pdf |title=Southeastern Conference Football |publisher=[[Raycom Sports]] |date=October 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150315052256/http://raycomsports.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/SECslick.pdf |archivedate=March 15, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jpsports.com/sec/tvschedule.html |title=JP Sports 1999 SEC football broadcast schedule |publisher=Jefferson Pilot Sports |date=1999 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000311234528/http://www.jpsports.com/sec/tvschedule.html |archivedate=March 11, 2000}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jpsports.com/sec_sch.htm#secnetwk |title=Schedules: SEC Football Game of the Week, 1996 Television Network |publisher=Jefferson Pilot Sports |date=1996 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19970105070602/http://www.jpsports.com/sec_sch.htm#secnetwk |archivedate=January 5, 1997}}</ref> Those games moved to WUXP in 2002, and stayed with that station until 2009, when [[Raycom Sports]] lost the syndication rights to [[ESPN Events|ESPN Plus]]. WUXP carried ESPN Plus-oriented [[SEC TV]] until 2014, when the [[SEC Network]] was launched.

===Past programming preemptions and deferrals===
In the mid-1980s, WSMV dropped the ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson|Tonight Show]]'' to air sitcom reruns such as ''[[Three's Company]]'', ''[[Alice (American TV series)|Alice]]'', ''[[Barney Miller]]'', ''[[Family Ties]]'', and ''Rosie''. NBC was able to get the show on in Nashville on then-[[independent station (North America)|independent station]] (now [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] affiliate) [[WZTV]] (channel 17).

In early 2006, WSMV attracted some attention by becoming the largest NBC affiliate in terms of market size to refuse to carry the controversial NBC show ''[[The Book of Daniel (television)|The Book of Daniel]]'' on its schedule, after the premiere episode. This action, along with that of several smaller affiliates in the Midwest and South, as well as low ratings, prompted NBC to cancel the series after only three episodes.

==News operation==
{{More citations needed section|date=September 2014}}
WSMV-TV broadcasts 40½ hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with 6½ hours each weekday and four hours each on Saturdays and Sundays); in regards to the number of hours devoted to news programming, it is the highest local newscast output among all broadcast television stations in the Nashville market.

Beginning in the mid-1970s, WSM-TV developed a strong news division that, in the 1980s, won numerous regional and national awards ([[Peabody Award]]s among them) for in-depth and investigative reporting. Mike Kettenring was the [[news director]] for much of that period. For most of the last two decades, WSMV has been a solid runner-up to WTVF in the Nashville ratings. Generally speaking, the station takes a softer approach to news than WTVF. The reverse was true in the 1980s, as WSMV earned awards for hard-hitting investigative stories, while WTVF took a more cautious approach. While WTVF usually leads the way in the city of Nashville itself, WSMV generally leads in Nashville's more conservative suburbs, as well as outlying rural parts of the market, many of whose residents recall readily the station's past association with WSM-AM. In recent years, however, ABC affiliate WKRN has steadily increased their ratings, particularly in the evening and late newscasts. In the November 2017 sweeps, WKRN passed WSMV as runner-up in the 5 p.m. and 6 p.m. newscasts, and tied WSMV for second place in the 10 p.m. newscast.<ref name="Scene">{{cite news |title=Anchor Down: How WSMV Walked Away From Demetria |url=https://www.nashvillescene.com/news/cover-story/article/20990725/anchor-down-how-wsmv-walked-away-from-demetria-kalodimos |work=Nashville Scene |last1=Cavendish |first1=Steve |volume=36 |issue=52 |date=February 1, 2018 |accessdate=February 1, 2018}}</ref>

On March 5, 1973, the [[Vanderbilt Television News Archive]] recorded off the air of WSM-TV a special broadcast of ''[[Today (U.S. TV program)|Today]]'' aimed toward veterans of the [[Vietnam War]] returning home to the U.S.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://tvnews.vanderbilt.edu/broadcasts/659421 |title=NBC Special (Re: Vietnam War POWs Release) |work=[[Today (U.S. TV program)|Today]] |via=Vanderbilt Television News Archive |date=March 5, 1973}}</ref> Two months later, on May 1, another broadcast of ''Today'' was recorded concerning the [[Watergate scandal]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://tvnews.vanderbilt.edu/broadcasts/659422 |title=NBC Special (Re: Watergate) |work=[[Today (U.S. TV program)|Today]] |via=Vanderbilt Television News Archive |date=May 1, 1973}}</ref> On both of these broadcasts, [[Pat Sajak]], who had recently joined the WSM radio and TV staff, anchored the five-minute cut-in local newscasts. As it was not the general policy of the Archive to record special programs such as these or local Nashville programming, these probably represent the only known broadcasts of WSM-TV news before 1980 or so available for public viewing, prior to the widespread popularity of [[video cassette recorders]] in the late 1970s. The only other ones were local cut-ins to NBC coverage of national elections. Because of the equipment at the time, though, the broadcasts were recorded in black and white. The Archive, prior to the advent of satellite technology in the 1980s, taped all NBC News broadcasts from the airwaves of WSM(V).

In September 1973, WSM-TV decided to fill the 6:30–7 p.m. time slot opened up by the [[Prime Time Access Rule]] in 1971 by expanding its 6 p.m. newscast to one hour. This has proven so successful that to this day WSMV programs a newscast from 6 to 7 p.m. (although it is now broken up into two 30-minute segments). Upon the success of the expanded 6 p.m. newscast on channel 4 (and after years of low-rated syndicated offerings in the 6:30 slot), WTVF followed suit in 1989 by expanding its 6 p.m. newscast to one hour. WSMV and WTVF are among the few stations in the [[Central Time Zone]] to run newscasts at 6:30 (stations elsewhere have attempted it since the 1970s with varying degrees of success). WKRN is the only traditional network affiliate in the Nashville market to run only a half-hour of news at 6 p.m., with ''[[Wheel of Fortune (U.S. game show)|Wheel of Fortune]]'' (hosted by former WSM personality Pat Sajak) airing at 6:30.

In the early 1980s, WSMV introduced the Snowbird character, a scarf- and earmuff-wearing [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] [[penguin]], as a brand for its weather-related school closing reports. Snowbird appears on-air in both [[animation|animated]] and [[puppet]] form. Snowbird reports are shown on the station primarily in the winter, but the branding is also used for unexpected school closings caused by other natural and man-made events, not necessarily limited to snow and ice. Due to the character's popularity, Snowbird serves as a year-round mascot for the station, with a {{convert|6|ft|m|spell=in|adj=on}}-tall costumed version making appearances at community events and station promotions. The station has also engaged in [[sweepstake|giving away]] Snowbird-themed apparel and [[tchotchke]]s as prizes during sweeps promotions. The Snowbird character has since been licensed to television stations in other markets, including [[WMC-TV]] in [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], [[WRCB]] in [[Chattanooga, Tennessee|Chattanooga]], [[WBOY-TV]] in [[Clarksburg, West Virginia|Clarksburg]], [[West Virginia]], and [[WTOV-TV]] in [[Steubenville, Ohio|Steubenville]], [[Ohio]], all NBC affiliates.

During the May sweeps period that began on April 26, 2007, WSMV debuted its own news helicopter known as ''Air 4'', becoming the second station in Nashville to do so ([[WTVF]]'s news helicopter ''Sky 5'' debuted a year earlier, in 2006). On September 15, 2008, beginning with the 5:00&nbsp;p.m. newscast, WSMV became the second television station in Nashville (after [[WTVF]]) to begin broadcasting its local newscasts in [[high-definition television|high definition]].

On May 26, 2011, WSMV debuted an hour-long 4 p.m. newscast, serving as a replacement for ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'', which ended its 25-year run the day before; this came on the heels of the expansion of other non-news local programming such as ''More at Midday'' and ''Better Nashville,'' indicating a decreased reliance on syndicated programming.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.wsmv.com/news/27978668/detail.html |title=Channel 4 News at 4:00 Starts Thursday |publisher=WSMV |date=May 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110526044121/http://www.wsmv.com/news/27978668/detail.html |archivedate=May 26, 2011}}</ref> On January 25, 2014, WSMV was the first station to expand its weekend morning newscast to 5:00&nbsp;a.m. in the Nashville TV market.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.adweek.com/tvspy/wsmv-expands-weekend-morning-newscasts/114193 |title=WSMV Expands Weekend Morning Newscasts |work=TVSpy |first=Merrill |last=Knox |date=January 15, 2014 |accessdate=February 1, 2018}}</ref>

On July 17, 2017, WSMV changed their newscast branding from ''Channel 4 News'' to ''News 4''. In January 2018, the station's news graphics and music were updated.

===Past on-air staff===
The station's former staff include [[Pat Sajak]] ([[continuity announcer|announcer]] and weekend weatherman from 1974 to 1977), [[Robin Roberts (sportscaster)|Robin Roberts]] (sports anchor and reporter from 1986 to 1988), [[John Tesh]] ([[News presenter|news anchor]] from 1975 to 1976), [[John Seigenthaler Jr.]] (weekend anchor in the late 1980s) and [[Huell Howser]] (features reporter in the 1970s).

[[Ralph Emery]], the longtime country music [[disc jockey]] on WSM radio for many years, hosted morning (and at times, afternoon) shows on channel 4 from the mid-1960s until 1993; for much of that time, ''The Ralph Emery Show'' was the highest-rated locally produced early morning shows on American television. Although the show included regular news briefs, its main focus was on general entertainment, including a heavy emphasis on live country music performed in studio. It featured acts by prominent country stars like [[Tex Ritter]] and current star [[Lorrie Morgan]]; also, the studio band consisted of top-notch [[Music Row]] session musicians. Emery would achieve widespread fame by hosting a national version of the show, entitled ''[[Nashville Now]]'', weeknights on The Nashville Network from 1983 to 1993. Upon Emery's retirement, WSMV briefly produced a local version of NBC's ''Today'' to serve as a lead-in to the national show. As ''Nashville Today'' failed to live up to expectations, WSMV finally programmed full-scale newscasts in early mornings, becoming the last of the three major Nashville stations to do so.

[[Larry Munson]], WSM-TV's sports director from 1956 to 1967 and later known as the play-by-play announcer for radio broadcasts of [[Georgia Bulldogs football]] (and, for a time, the NFL's [[Atlanta Falcons]]), created and hosted a long-running [[hunting]] and [[fishing]] show called ''The Rod & Gun Club''. [[Paul Eells]] replaced Munson as sports director in 1967. Like his predecessor, Eells served as the voice of the [[Vanderbilt Commodores]] football team during his time at WSM. Eells left to become the sports director at [[KATV]] in [[Little Rock, Arkansas]] in 1978. There, he also served as radio play-by-play announcer for the [[Arkansas Razorbacks]] for 28 years until his death in 2006. Munson died in 2011.

[[Dan Miller (television journalist/personality)|Dan Miller]] was co-anchor of the main evening newscasts for nearly 40 years, except from August 1986 to March 1995. During this period, Miller spent time in [[Los Angeles]] as a news anchor at [[KCBS-TV]], and as sidekick to friend and former WSM-TV colleague Pat Sajak on his short-lived CBS [[late-night talk show]] ''[[The Pat Sajak Show]]''. Miller returned to WSMV in 1992 to host ''5 O'Clock with Dan Miller'', which ran from 1992 to 1993. Miller returned to anchoring duties for the evening newscasts in March 1995, and continued until his sudden death in 2009.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.wsmv.com/news/19135962/detail.html |title=WSMV Achor Dan Miller Dead at 67 |publisher=WSMV |date=April 9, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090703131413/http://www.wsmv.com/news/19135962/detail.html |archivedate=July 3, 2009}}</ref>

In 1974, Bill Hall joined the staff as a weather reporter and morning news anchor. He briefly worked as a weekend news anchor in 1976 before moving into his role leading the weather team in 1977. His unique style and personality made him one of Middle Tennessee's most well known local television personalities. He punctuated his weather discussions with comments about gardening, cooking, and hunting and fishing. During his channel 4 career, Hall also hosted ''Land and Lakes,'' an outdoors show focusing on local hunting and fishing adventures. Hall retired in 2005, and later died on December 23, 2011.<ref name=MetroRS2006-1126>{{cite web |url=http://www.nashville.gov/mc/resolutions/term_2003_2007/rs2006_1126.htm |title=Resolution No. RS2006-1126: A resolution recognizing and commending Bill Hall for his outstanding contributions to Nashville and Davidson County as he retires after thirty-one years on television. |publisher=Council of the Metropolitan Government of Nashville and Davidson County |date=January 9, 2006 |accessdate=May 20, 2011}}</ref><ref name=About.com2005-1129>{{Cite news |url=http://nashville.about.com/b/2005/11/29/nashvilles-favorite-weatherman-bill-hall-is-retiring-from-channel-4-this-week.htm |title=Nashville's Favorite Weatherman, Bill Hall is Retiring From Channel 4 this Week |website=About.com |last=Duke |first=Jan |date=November 29, 2005 |accessdate=May 20, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928213714/http://nashville.about.com/b/2005/11/29/nashvilles-favorite-weatherman-bill-hall-is-retiring-from-channel-4-this-week.htm |archivedate=September 28, 2011}}</ref><ref name=NCP2005-1130>{{Cite news |url=http://nashvillecitypaper.com/content/city-news/bill-hall-hangs-his-weather-hat |title=Bill Hall hangs up his weather hat |work=Nashville City Paper |date=November 30, 2005 |accessdate=May 20, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100203215822/http://nashvillecitypaper.com/content/city-news/bill-hall-hangs-his-weather-hat |archivedate=February 3, 2010}}</ref>

Rudy Kalis began anchoring the morning newscasts in 2014 after working in the sports department for 40 years. He was the second sportscaster in Nashville to move to anchoring the morning news in the past year.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.tennessean.com/story/sports/2014/11/25/kalis-leaves-sports-news/70080936/ |title=Rudy Kalis leaves sports for morning news at Channel 4 |work=[[The Tennessean]] |first=Mike |last=Organ |date=November 25, 2014 |accessdate=September 18, 2016}}</ref> He retired in November 2017, after 43 years with channel 4.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.wsmv.com/news/rudy-kalis-retires-after-43-years-at-wsmv/article_be67db1e-49db-5502-8ef0-50a7e88aaed1.html |title=Rudy Kalis retires after 43 years at WSMV |publisher=WSMV |first=Terry |last=Bulger |date=November 29, 2017}}</ref>

==Out-of-market coverage==

===South-central Kentucky=== 
For its first 60 years on the air, WSMV was the default NBC affiliate for the [[Bowling Green, Kentucky|Bowling Green]] [[media market]] in south-central [[Kentucky]]. It had a decades-long monopoly in providing NBC programming for that area from its September 1950 inception until March 27, 2001, when WKNT (now [[WNKY]] channel 40) in Bowling Green was forced to dropped its [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] network affiliation due to violation of the terms in their affiliation agreement. Immediately after losing Fox, WNKY signed up with NBC. The station remains on [[Mediacom]] cable systems serving the [[Morgantown, Kentucky|Morgantown]] ([[Butler County, Kentucky|Butler County]]) and [[Brownsville, Kentucky|Brownsville]] ([[Edmonson County, Kentucky|Edmonson County]]) areas.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://mediacomtoday-lineup.com/lineup/321/morgantown_brownsville_butler_co__and_edmonson_co_.aspx |title=Mediacom Channel Lineup: Brownsville, Butler Co., Edmonson Co. & Morgantown, KY |publisher=Mediacom |date=July 13, 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170823022505/https://mediacomtoday-lineup.com/lineup/321/morgantown_brownsville_butler_co__and_edmonson_co_.aspx |archivedate=August 23, 2017}}</ref> Even after WNKY switched to NBC in 2001, the Glasgow Electric Plant Board did not drop WSMV and its associated subchannels from their lineup until late 2017 when WNKY claimed market exclusivity on that system in terms of NBC and CBS affiliates.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.glasgow-ky.com/cable_lineup.pdf |title=Glasgow EPB Cable Channel Lineup |publisher=Glasgow Electric Plant Board |date=January 11, 2016 |accessdate=February 1, 2018}}{{dead link|date=July 2020|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>

Mediacom also carries WSMV on its systems in [[Hart County, Kentucky|Hart]] and [[Metcalfe County, Kentucky|Metcalfe Counties]] (including [[Munfordville, Kentucky|Munfordville]] and [[Edmonton, Kentucky|Edmonton]], respectively).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mediacomtoday-lineup.com/lineup/322/munfordville_bonnieville_and_hart_co_.aspx |title=Mediacom Channel Lineup: Munfordville, Bonnieville & Hart Co., KY |publisher=Mediacom |date=February 13, 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150224211828/http://www.mediacomtoday-lineup.com/lineup/322/munfordville_bonnieville_and_hart_co_.aspx |archivedate=February 24, 2015}}</ref>

===Western Kentucky=== 
In addition to the station's cable coverage in south central Kentucky, WSMV-TV, and the other two "[[Big Three television networks|Big Three]]" stations are also carried in [[Murray, Kentucky]], in the [[Paducah, Kentucky|Paducah, KY]]–[[Cape Girardeau, Missouri|Cape Girardeau, MO]]–[[Harrisburg, Illinois|Harrisburg, IL]] media market, via Murray Electric Systems. WK&T Cable also carries both WSMV and WTVF on its cable lineup for its customers in [[Calloway County, Kentucky|Calloway County]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.mywkt.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Calloway-County-Channel-Line-Up-February-2020.pdf |title=Channel Lineup: Calloway County, Kentucky |publisher=WK&T |date=February 2020}}</ref> WSMV, along with WTVF, are also available to Mediacom’s customers in [[Caldwell County, Kentucky|Caldwell]] and [[Crittenden County, Kentucky|Crittenden Counties]], respectively including the communities of [[Princeton, Kentucky|Princeton]] and [[Marion, Kentucky|Marion]], along with the town of [[Fredonia, Kentucky|Fredonia]]. All of those areas are also within the Paducah/Cape Girardeau market, which is the home market to fellow NBC affiliate [[WPSD-TV]].

WSMV was also previously available in some southern areas of the [[Evansville, Indiana]] media market, mainly including northwestern Kentucky towns such as [[Madisonville, Kentucky|Madisonville]], [[Central City, Kentucky|Central City]], [[Beaver Dam, Kentucky|Beaver Dam]], and [[Owensboro, Kentucky|Owensboro]] and their corresponding counties. The Owensboro ''[[Messenger-Inquirer]]'' still lists WSMV on its TV listings page. Cable systems in those areas have since dropped the station making Evansville NBC affiliate [[WFIE]] the sole NBC affiliate on cable and over-the-air in those areas.

===West Tennessee===
WSMV, along with WMC-TV in Memphis, was historically carried on cable systems in the [[Jackson, Tennessee]] market on EPlus Broadband Cable by the Jackson Energy Authority. In November 2014, WSMV was dropped from that cable system when [[WNBJ-LD]] signed on as that area's own NBC affiliate.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.jacksonsun.com/story/money/business/columnists/2014/10/01/nbc-affiliate-wnbj-channel-arrives-jackson/16556887/ |title=NBC affiliate WNBJ channel 39 arrives in Jackson |work=[[The Jackson Sun]] |first=David |last=Thomas |date=October 1, 2014 |accessdate=June 12, 2015}}</ref> WNBJ replaced WSMV on JEA channel 4, with WMC-TV being left intact. In spite of the existence of WNBJ-LD in Jackson, WSMV remains on WK&T Telecom's cable system in [[Gibson County, Tennessee|Gibson County]], in the northernmost area of the Jackson market.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.mywkt.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Gibson-County-Channel-Line-Up-February-2020.pdf |title=Channel Lineup: Gibson County, Tennessee |publisher=WK&T |date=February 2020}}</ref> WSMV is also still available on cable in [[Carroll County, Tennessee|Carroll County]] as well.

===Huntsville/Northern Alabama=== 
At sometime from 1957 until the 1980s, cable systems in northern Alabama, including Knology (now [[Wide Open West]]) and [[TelePrompTer Corporation|TelePrompTer]] (later [[Group W Cable]], now [[Comcast]]), carried all of Nashville's Big Three stations, only to be dropped due to the increase of new cable channels launching during the 1980s and early 1990s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.huntsvillerewound.com/HSVtvhistory |title=Huntsville TV Market History |website=HuntsvilleRewound.com |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091115102208/http://www.huntsvillerewound.com/HSVtvhistory |archivedate=November 15, 2009}}</ref> The Nashville stations were once seen as far south as [[Decatur, Alabama|Decatur]].
