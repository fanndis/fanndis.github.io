"'''I'm with You'''" is a song by Canadian singer-songwriter [[Avril Lavigne]] for her debut album, ''[[Let Go (Avril Lavigne album)|Let Go]]''. It was released on November 19, 2002 by [[Arista Records]] as the album's third single. The song was Lavigne's first ballad released as a single. It was the second Lavigne song to be nominated for a Grammy in the categories [[Grammy Award for Song of the Year|Song of the Year]] and [[Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance|Best Female Pop Vocal Performance]] at the [[46th Annual Grammy Awards]].

The song reached number four on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], as well as reaching the top ten in nine other countries, thus making it Lavigne's third single to reach the top ten. "I'm with You" received radio and television airplay in Australia, but it was not officially released there.

==Reception==
===Critical reception===
The song received critical acclaim from music critics. The arrangement of singles from ''Let Go'', with "I'm with You" as the third, was regarded as "controversial choices", given that "I'm with You" was "thought by some to be the biggest potential smash on the album", and could have established Lavigne as a more mature artist if it was released first. According to Reid, "Some people just really didn't get that. And with the first video, there was some concern that maybe because it's so young and so playful, it might alienate more serious music lovers."{{r|WillmanBoy}} ''[[KidsWorld]]'' called it "the perfect song to drown your sorrows to when that guy from your class breaks your heart."{{r|kidsworld}}

===Chart performance===
"I'm with You" became Lavigne's third top 10 song when it peaked at number four on [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] in 2003 during its ninth week on the chart.{{r|bb100}} The song spent ten consecutive weeks on the top 10 and twenty-seven weeks on the Hot 100 making it Lavigne's second-longest staying song on this chart, surpassed by her debut single "[[Complicated (Avril Lavigne song)|Complicated]]" which stayed on the chart for 31 weeks.{{r|bblistings|bbhistory}} "I'm with You" ranked at number 18 on the [[Billboard Year-End Hot 100 singles of 2003|''Billboard'' Year-End Hot 100 singles of 2003]] and number 13 on the [[Canadian Singles Chart]].{{r|vnuemedia}} The song was certified gold by [[Recording Industry Association of America]] in 2006 for sales of over 500,000 copies in the United States.{{r|RIAA}} As of July 2013, ''I'm with You'' had sold 556,000 digital copies in the US.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/1569263/ask-billboard-why-do-some-songs-fade-out-and-others-end-cold?page=0%2C3 |title=Sales updates on Avril Lavigne |publisher=Billboard |date=5 July 2013 |accessdate=9 July 2013}}</ref> As a double A-side [[DVD single]], the "I'm with You"/"[[Sk8er Boi]]" video single was certified gold and platinum in 2003.{{r|RIAA}}

==Music video==
[[File:IkTEshR.png|240px|right|thumbnail|Lavigne in a pub in the song's music video.]]
The single's [[music video]], directed by renowned photographer [[David LaChapelle]], involves Lavigne, who is seen alone, trying to find someone, whilst her band members play the song alone in the streets. Showing her originally at a party, the video also sees Lavigne pushing a guy when he tries to get with her straight after making out with another woman. Most of the video is shown in slow motion but Lavigne's mouth movements are in sync with the song's vocals. This was achieved by recording the footage while the song was played twice as fast. The video also sees Lavigne walking on the streets and wearing a black jacket. Through the video, she is seen standing behind a snowy bank. At the end of the video, Lavigne walks out of the club with her coat on, kicks out the door and walks away. [[Much Music]] named the video one of the "Top 100 Best Videos of All Time".{{r|mmusic}} The music video was originally meant to end with Lavigne walking out of the club to her bandmates, who then greet her and walk off together into the distance, but this ending was removed during post-production, ending the video with her leaving alone.<ref>{{cite web|title=Avril Lavigne - Making of I'm With You (B Roll) 8/11/2002|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp5IgPvdFcs}}</ref> An alternative version of the video leaked online to the internet, comprising alternate shots, slightly longer sequences and featuring the originally filmed ending.

It was at least partly filmed in [[Los Angeles]]. The street shots were filmed on [[Broadway (Los Angeles)|Broadway]], and the [[Orpheum Theatre (Los Angeles)|Orpheum Theatre]] is seen.
