==History==
[[File:The Chen Clan's Academy.jpg|thumb|The [[Chen Clan Academy]] in [[Guangzhou]], China]]
Chen descends from the legendary sage king [[Emperor Shun]] from around 2200 BC via the surname [[Gui (ancestral surname)|Gui]] ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|媯}}}}).{{sfn|Yang|2003|p=121}}{{sfn|Han|2010|pp=2776–7}}

A millennia after Emperor Shun, when [[King Wu of Zhou]] established the [[Zhou dynasty]] (c. 1046 BC), he enfeoffed his son-in-law [[Gui Man]], also known as [[Duke Hu of Chen]] or [[Chen Hugong]] (陈胡公). Chen Hugong, a descendant of Emperor Shun, found the [[State of Chen]] in modern [[Huaiyang County]], [[Henan]] Province.{{sfn|Yang|2003|p=121}}{{sfn|Han|2010|pp=2776–7}} In 479 BC, Chen was absorbed by [[Chu (state)|Chu]] and became the Chu capital. The people of Chen adopted the name of their former state as their surname.{{sfn|Yang|2003|p=121}}{{sfn|Han|2010|pp=2776–7}}

At the end of the Qin dynasty, [[Chen Sheng]] initiated the [[Chen Sheng Wu Guang Uprising]] that overthrew the Qin and paved the way for the [[Han dynasty]], one of China's golden ages.<ref>{{cite book|author=Hong Liu|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LbgkCwAAQBAJ&q=Dazexiang+uprising&pg=PA145|title=The Chinese Strategic Mind|publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing|year=2015|page=145|isbn = 9781783474141}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Joshua Zhang, James D.

During this period, the [[nomad]]ic [[Xianbei]] people had systematically assimilated into China's [[agrarian society|agrarian]] culture and adopted Han Chinese surnames under the state directives of [[Emperor Xiaowen of Northern Wei]]. The Xianbei subjects whose surname of "侯莫陳" (Hóumòchén) were converted to "陳" (Chen).<ref>{{cite web|title=Web.archive.org|url=http://www.fortunecity.com/victorian/twain/1279/royalhouse/xianbei/xianbeiname.htm|url-status=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040910153654/http://www.fortunecity.com/victorian/twain/1279/royalhouse/xianbei/xianbeiname.htm|archivedate=10 September 2004}}</ref>

Some descendants of Chen migrated to Vietnam (Dai Viet) and established the [[Trần dynasty]], a golden age in Vietnam. Their original home was [[Fujian]], and they migrated under Trần Kinh (陳京 Chén Jīng). [[Trần Thái Tông]] (陈太宗 Chen Taizong) became the founding emperor of the Tran dynasty, and his descendants would rule Vietnam for more than a century, expanding Vietnam's territory and promoting developments in language, [[Chữ Nôm|chu nom]], culture, and art. Certain members of the clan could still speak Chinese, like when a [[Yuan dynasty]] envoy had a meeting with the Chinese-speaking Tran Prince [[Trần Quốc Tuấn]] in 1282.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=6UHi9JXNokEC&pg=PA120&q=tran%20fujian Taylor 2013], p. 120.</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=6UHi9JXNokEC&pg=PA103#v=onepage Taylor 2013], p. 103.</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=gyPjBevBHxcC&pg=PA159 ed.
