'''''Talking Points Memo''''' (or '''''TPM''''') is a political news and opinion website created and run by [[Josh Marshall]] that debuted on November 12, 2000. The name is a reference to the memo (short list) with the issues (points) discussed by one's side in a debate or used to support a position taken on an issue.<ref>See "[[talking point]]"</ref> By 2007, ''TPM'' received an average of 400,000 page views every weekday.<ref name='cjr-josh-marshall-plan'>{{cite news | url=https://www.cjr.org/feature/the_josh_marshall_plan.php | publisher=[[Columbia Journalism Review]] | title=The (Josh) Marshall Plan | last=Glenn | first=David | date=Septemberâ€“October 2007 | accessdate=September 8, 2007}}</ref>

[[Robert W. McChesney]] and [[John Nichols (journalist)|John Nichols]] describe the site as taking a "more raucous and sensational" tone than traditional news media.  This includes coining phrases such as "Bamboozlepalooza" to describe [[George W. Bush]]'s efforts to [[Social Security debate in the United States|privatize Social Security]], which the blog opposed.  McChesney and Nichols compare this to the [[muckraking]] of [[Upton Sinclair]].  The more social aspects of the site, which invite [[crowdsourcing]], were compared to ''[[La Follette's Weekly]]''.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Death and Life of American Journalism|last1=McChesney|first1=Robert W.|last2=Nichols|first2=John|publisher=[[PublicAffairs]]|year=2010|isbn=978-1-56858-700-4|page=91|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g85l-l-CnbIC&pg=PA91}}</ref>

Guest bloggers have included [[Matthew Yglesias]], [[Robert Reich]], [[Dean Baker]], [[Michael Crowley (journalist)|Michael Crowley]], and, briefly, Vice-Presidential candidate [[John Edwards]]. Beginning in the summer of 2006, many weekend postings were provided by [[anonymous blogger]] ''DK.'' On November 11, 2006, ''DK'' was revealed to be lawyer David Kurtz, who now openly posts under his name.

On July 10, 2007, the site had a major overhaul, adding much content from its related sites to the main page. It is part of the effort to have more original reporting on the website.

In 2007, ''TPM'' won a [[Polk Award]] for its coverage of the 2006 [[Dismissal of U.S. attorneys controversy|U.S. Attorneys scandal]], becoming the only blog so far to win the award.<ref>[http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/02/24/business/blogger.php "A Web-only news operation gets its due"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', 24 February 2008</ref>
