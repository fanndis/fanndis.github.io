Once known for its sexualized ad campaigns, the company has toned down its imagery and no longer displays nearly nude models in their advertisements. According to then-Chairman Arthur Martinez, these changes were implemented to show that the company is evolving along with its consumers.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/abercrombie-and-fitch-then-and-now-2016-1/#abercrombie-used-to-feature-naked-people-1|title=These before-and-after photos show how much Abercrombie & Fitch has changed|newspaper=Business Insider|access-date=2016-11-04}}</ref> It is now targeting an older consumer, from ages 21 and up.<ref>{{cite press release|url=https://finance.yahoo.com/news/abercrombie-fitch-launches-fully-integrated-154601271.html|title=Abercrombie & Fitch Launches New Fully Integrated Campaign: "This is the Time"|date=19 October 2017}}</ref>

=== 1892-1997 ===
The company was founded in 1892 in the [[Manhattan]] [[borough (New York City)|borough]] of New York City, New York, by [[David T. Abercrombie]] as an [[outfitter]] for the elite [[outdoorsman]]. [[Ezra Fitch]]—a wealthy lawyer and real estate developer, and devoted customer of the Abercrombie Company—bought a significant interest in the business in 1900.<ref name="BIhist">{{cite web |last1=Schlossberg |first1=Mallory |title=The bizarre history of Abercrombie & Fitch — and how the retailer is transforming yet again |url=https://www.businessinsider.com/abercrombie-fitch-crazy-history-2011-4#abercrombie-was-the-place-to-go-for-hunters-in-the-early-1900s-1 |website=Business Insider |publisher=Insider Inc. |access-date=27 February 2020 |date=12 January 2016 }}</ref>  In 1904, it was incorporated and renamed "Abercrombie & Fitch Co."  Fitch eventually bought Abercrombie's share of the business becoming the sole owner from 1907 to 1928.<ref name="BIhist" />  The company was an elite outfitter of sporting and excursion goods, particularly noted for its expensive [[shotgun]]s, [[fishing rod]]s, fishing boats, and tents<ref name="BIhist" /> At one time it had outfitted [[Theodore Roosevelt]]'s safari and Adm. [[Richard E. Byrd]]'s expedition to [[Antarctica]].  [[Ernest Hemingway]] was also a regular customer and following the writer's death in 1961 his wife placed several of his guns on [[consignment]] with Abercrombie and Fitch.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Calabi |first1=Silvio |last2=Helsley |first2=Steve |last3=Sanger |first3=Roger |title=Hemingway's Beretta |url=https://www.americanrifleman.org/articles/2011/1/13/hemingways-beretta/ |website=American Rifleman |publisher=[[National Rifle Association]] |access-date=27 February 2020 |date=13 January 2011 }}</ref> 

==== 1970s: Bankruptcy ====
By the 1970s, the business was struggling with lower priced competition while trying to maintain its image.  It was known for holding an extensive inventory of lavish items but operating expenses forced them to shed the most expensive items, such as an $18,000 ($80,000 in 2018) gold and onyx chess set.  Cash flow problems forced them to also cut inventory on moderate priced items.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1976/08/07/archives/abercrombie-fitch-in-bankruptcy-step-abercrombie-fitch-planning-to.html |title=Abercrombie & Fitch in Bankruptcy Step |last=Barmash |first=Isadore |date=August 7, 1976 |website=The New York Times |access-date=20 August 2018}}</ref> 

In 1976, it filed for [[Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 11 bankruptcy]], finally closing its flagship store at [[Madison Avenue]] and East 45th Street in 1977.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/Abercrombie-amp;-Fitch-Co-Company-History.html |title=Abercrombie & Fitch Co. History |publisher=Funding Universe |access-date=July 8, 2015}}</ref>

==== 1978:  Revival ====
Shortly thereafter the name was revived in 1978; [[Oshman's Sporting Goods]], a [[Houston]]-based chain owned by Jake Oshman,<ref>''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', 1978{{full citation needed|date=July 2015}}</ref> bought the defunct firm's name and mailing list for $1.5 million<ref name="NYMag">[http://nymag.com/thecut/2014/02/why-abercrombie-is-losing-its-shirt.html "Why Abercrombie Is Losing Its Shirt"].

It also opened shops in Beverly Hills, Dallas, and (by the mid-1980s) New York City. 

==== 1988: The Limited acquisition ====
Finally, in 1988, Oshman's sold the company name and operations to [[Limited Brands|The Limited]], a clothing-chain operator based in [[Columbus, Ohio]]. It gradually shifted its focus to young adults, first as a subsidiary of Limited Brands and then as a separate, [[publicly traded company]];<ref>{{cite news| url=http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/business/companies/abercrombie-and-fitch-co/index.html | title=Company Information | work=[[The New York Times]] | first=Isadore | last=Barmash}}</ref> and grew to become one of the largest apparel firms in the United States.<ref name="Portfolio">{{cite web|url=http://www.portfolio.com/resources/company-profiles/3375 |title=Top Company Profiles – Abercrombie & Fitch |access-date=July 19, 2007 |last=Banay |first=Sophia |publisher=[[Portfolio.com]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070622124955/http://www.portfolio.com/resources/company-profiles/3375 |archive-date=June 22, 2007 |url-status=live |df=mdy }}</ref>

Since 1997, the company has kept a high profile due to its advertising, its philanthropy, and its involvement in legal conflicts over branding, clothing style and employment practices. In the first decade of the 21st century, the [[Great Recession]] battered the company's business as teenagers looked to lower-priced [[fast fashion]] brands like [[H&M]] and [[Forever 21]] for fashion. 

=== 2007-Present ===
The company's stock price dropped from an all-time high of $84.23 in October 2007 to a low of $14.64 in November 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://finance.yahoo.com/q/hp?s=ANF |title=ANF Historical Prices &#124; Abercrombie & Fitch Company Com Stock |publisher=Yahoo!

[[File:Abercrombie & Fitch store in New York City.jpg|thumb|Abercrombie & Fitch store in New York City]]
To combat heavy competition from fast-fashion retailers like Forever 21 and H&M, the company announced key changes to its image. It aims to reduce emphasis on sexualized advertising and focus more on customer service and diversity. Among the changes announced are eliminating sexualized advertising, no longer having shirtless models at new store openings, and eliminating sexualized pictures and advertising on bags, gift cards, and in stores. They are changing the name of store employees from "models" to "brand representatives", and will allow a more individualistic dress code. "Brand representatives" will also focus more on customer service by offering to help serve customers, as opposed to past policies of aloofness. They also aim to promote more diversity among store employees and executives as well. The company is signaling it will be implementing changes quickly.{{when|date=January 2020}}<ref name="models"/>

As of May 2015, the changes were apparent in stores. All "permanent marketing" images at the cash wrap and fitting rooms have been removed. Also, store models are no longer dressed in Abercrombie clothes.<ref name="models"/>

[[Governor of West Virginia|West Virginia Governor]] [[Bob Wise]] spoke out against the company for depicting "an unfounded, negative [[stereotype]] of West Virginia", but the shirts were not removed.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/03/23/national/23WVA.html|title=T-Shirt Slight Has West Virginia in Arms|author=Dao, James|date=March 22, 2004|work=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=October 28, 2011}}</ref> Later, another T-shirt that said "L is for Loser" next to a picture of a male gymnast on the rings gathered publicity.

In 2005, the [[Women and Girls Foundation]] of Southwest Pennsylvania launched a "[[boycott|Girlcott]]" of the store to protest the sale of T-shirts displaying messages such as "Who needs brains when you have these?", "Available for parties," and "I had a nightmare I was a brunette." The campaign received national coverage on ''[[Today (NBC program)|The Today Show]]'', and the company pulled the shirts from stores on November 5, 2005.<ref>{{cite news |title=Abercrombie & Fitch to pull tees after 'girl-cott' |url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20051106/us_nm/retail_abercrombiefitch_dc |access-date=27 February 2020 |work=Yahoo News |agency=Reuters |date=6 November 2005 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051109155924/https://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20051106/us_nm/retail_abercrombiefitch_dc |archive-date=9 November 2005}}</ref> Five days after this media coverage, the company pulled two of the shirts from its shelves, released an apology to girls for producing the T-shirts, and agreed to have corporate executives meet with the "Girlcott" girls at the company's headquarters.<ref>Staff (October 25, 2005).

In November 2010, the [[Southampton|Southampton, England]], store prevented 18-year-old Harriet Phipps from wearing a [[remembrance poppy]], which is worn as part of the [[Remembrance Day]] commemorations in the United Kingdom and Canada every November.  The official reason for the refusal was reported to be that the poppy is not considered part of the corporate approved uniform, and is therefore prohibited.<ref>Staff (November 8, 2010).

Our company policy is to allow associates to wear a poppy as a token of this appreciation on Remembrance Day.

In 2017, the company began remodeling stores in selected locations into a new prototype design. The design features a complete revamp of the store entrance including removing the gender-specific sides of the store and majority of the interior walls. Lighting is also brighter throughout the store and the cologne amount sprayed has been reduced. The prototype stores also feature suite-style changing rooms, which include lighting and music volume control specific for the suite and oversized mirrors.

==Brands==
The company has operated four concept brands apart from its namesake over the years; they have been referred to as [[subsidiary|subsidiaries]], but operate as divisions under the company's umbrella.

===Lawsuits against other parties===
In 2002, the company filed a lawsuit against [[American Eagle Outfitters]], claiming that American Eagle copied the company's garment designs, among other things. The lawsuit was based on a [[trade dress|trade-dress]] claim, stating that American Eagle had very closely mimicked the company's products' visual appearance and packaging. Specifically, it claimed that American Eagle copied particular articles of clothing, in-store displays and advertisements, and even its product catalog. Despite the admission that American Eagle might have utilized very similar materials, designs, in-store displays, symbols, color combinations, and patterns as A&F, the court ruled that there was not an excessive level of similarity to confuse potential customers, and therefore the court ruled in favor of American Eagle.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.audiocasefiles.com/acf_cases/9996-abercrombie-fitch-stores-inc-v-american-eagle-outfitters |title=Abercrombie & Fitch Stores, Inc. v.
