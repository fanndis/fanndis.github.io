<!-- Definition and symptoms -->

Two exit routes of ''M. leprae'' from the human body often described are the skin and the nasal mucosa, although their relative importance is not clear.

== Mechanism ==
Most leprosy complications are the result of nerve damage. The nerve damage occurs due to direct invasion by the ''M. leprae'' bacteria and a person's immune response resulting in inflammation.<ref name="Rei2019"/> The molecular mechanism underlying how ''M. leprae'' produces the symptoms of leprosy is not clear,<ref name=Rod2011/> but ''M. leprae'' has been shown to bind to [[Schwann cell]]s, which may lead to nerve injury including [[demyelination]] and a loss of nerve function (specifically a loss of [[axon]]al conductance).<ref name=":10">{{cite journal |last1=Bhat |first1=Ramesh Marne |last2=Prakash |first2=Chaitra |date=2012 |title=Leprosy: An Overview of Pathophysiology |journal=Interdisciplinary Perspectives on Infectious Diseases |volume=2012 |pages=181089 |doi=10.1155/2012/181089 |pmid=22988457 |pmc=3440852 |issn=1687-708X}}</ref> Numerous molecular mechanisms have been associated with this nerve damage including the presence of a [[laminin]]-binding [[protein]] and the glycoconjugate (PGL-1) on the surface of ''M. leprae'' that can bind to laminin on [[peripheral nerves]].<ref name=":10"/>

As part of the human immune response, [[white blood cell]]-derived [[macrophage]]s may engulf ''M. leprae'' by [[phagocytosis]].<ref name=":10"/>

In the initial stages, small sensory and autonomic nerve fibers in the skin of a person with leprosy are damaged.<ref name="Rei2019"/> This damage usually results in hair loss to the area, a loss of the ability to sweat, and numbness (decreased ability to detect sensations such as temperature and touch). Further peripheral nerve damage may result in skin dryness, more numbness, and muscle weaknesses or paralysis in the area affected.<ref name="Rei2019"/> The skin can crack and if the skin injuries are not carefully cared for, there is a risk for a secondary infection that can lead to more severe damage.<ref name="Rei2019"/>

== Diagnosis ==
[[File:Monofilament_testing.jpg|alt=|thumb|right|Testing for loss of sensation with monofilament]]
In countries where people are frequently infected, a person is considered to have leprosy if they have one of the following two signs:

* Skin lesion consistent with leprosy and with definite sensory loss.<ref name=":4">"Diagnosis of Leprosy." WHO. from {{cite web|url=https://www.who.int/lep/diagnosis/en/|title=WHO &#124; Diagnosis of leprosy|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140605091219/http://www.who.int/lep/diagnosis/en/|archive-date=2014-06-05|url-status=live|access-date=2014-07-14}} accessed on 14 July 2014.</ref>
* Positive skin smears.<ref name=":4" />

Skin lesions can be single or many, and usually [[Hypopigmentation|hypopigmented]], although occasionally reddish or copper-colored.<ref name=":4" /> The lesions may be flat ([[macule]]s), raised ([[papule]]s), or solid elevated areas ([[nodule (medicine)|nodular]]).<ref name=":4" /> Experiencing sensory loss at the skin lesion is a feature that can help determine if the lesion is caused by leprosy or if the lesion is caused by another disorder such as [[tinea versicolor]].<ref name=":4" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.internationaltextbookofleprosy.org/sites/default/files/ITL_2_3%20FINAL.pdf|title=International Textbook of Leprosy|last1=Moschella|first1=Samuel L|last2=Garcia-Albea|first2=Victoria|date=September 2016|website=Differential Diagnosis of Leprosy|page=3, Section 2.3|access-date=July 4, 2019}}</ref> Thickened nerves are associated with leprosy and can be accompanied by loss of sensation or muscle weakness, but without the characteristic skin lesion and sensory loss, muscle weakness is not considered a reliable sign of leprosy.<ref name=":4" />

In some cases, acid-fast leprosy [[bacilli]] in skin smears are considered diagnostic; however, the diagnosis is typically made without laboratory tests, based on symptoms.<ref name=":4" /> If a person has a new leprosy diagnosis and already has a visible disability due to leprosy, the diagnosis is considered late.<ref name="Rei2019" />

In countries or areas where leprosy is uncommon, such as the United States, diagnosis of leprosy is often delayed because healthcare providers are unaware of leprosy and its symptoms.<ref name="hrsa.gov" /> Early diagnosis and treatment prevent nerve involvement, the hallmark of leprosy, and the disability it causes.<ref name="WHO2014" /><ref name="hrsa.gov">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Health Resources and Services Administration.

=== Classification ===
Several different approaches for classifying leprosy exist. There are similarities between the classification approaches.

Early detection of the disease is important, since physical and neurological damage may be irreversible even if cured.<ref name="WHO2014" /> Medications can decrease the risk of those living with people who have leprosy from acquiring the disease and likely those with whom people with leprosy come into contact outside the home.<ref name="Rod2011" /> The WHO recommends that preventive medicine be given to people who are in close contact with someone who has leprosy.<ref name="WHO2018Tx" /> The suggested preventive treatment is a single dose of rifampicin (SDR) in adults and children over 2 years old who do not already have leprosy or tuberculosis.<ref name="WHO2018Tx" /> Preventive treatment is associated with a 57% reduction in infections within 2 years and a 30% reduction in infections within 6 years.<ref name="WHO2018Tx" />

[[File:MDTRegimens.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|MDT antileprosy drugs: standard regimens from 2010]]

===Anti-leprosy medication===
A number of [[leprostatic agent]]s are available for treatment. A 3-drug regimen of [[rifampicin]], [[dapsone]] and [[clofazimine]] is recommended for all people with leprosy, for 6 months for paucibacillary leprosy and 12 months for multibacillary leprosy.<ref name="WHO2018Tx" />

Multidrug therapy (MDT) remains highly effective, and people are no longer infectious after the first monthly dose.<ref name="WHO2014" /> It is safe and easy to use under field conditions due to its presentation in calendar blister packs.<ref name="WHO2014" /> Post-treatment relapse rates remain low.<ref name="WHO2014" /> Resistance has been reported in several countries, although the number of cases is small.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.who.int/lep/mdt/resistance/en/|title=WHO {{!}} MDT and drug resistance|website=WHO|access-date=2019-07-22}}</ref> People with rifampicin-resistant leprosy may be treated with second line drugs such as [[fluoroquinolones]], [[minocycline]], or [[clarithromycin]], but the treatment duration is 24 months due to their lower [[Bactericide|bactericidal]] activity.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Reibel|first1=F.|last2=Cambau|first2=E.|last3=Aubry|first3=A.|date=2015-09-01|title=Update on the epidemiology, diagnosis, and treatment of leprosy|journal=Médecine et Maladies Infectieuses|volume=45|issue=9|pages=383–393|doi=10.1016/j.medmal.2015.09.002|pmid=26428602|issn=0399-077X}}</ref> Evidence on the potential benefits and harms of alternative regimens for drug-resistant leprosy is not yet available.<ref name="WHO2018Tx" />

== History ==

[[File:Gerhard Armauer Hansen.jpg|thumb|[[Gerhard Armauer Hansen|G. H. A. Hansen]], discoverer of ''[[Mycobacterium leprae|M. leprae]]'']]
Using comparative genomics, in 2005, geneticists traced the origins and worldwide distribution of leprosy from East Africa or the Near East along human migration routes. They found four strains of ''M. leprae'' with specific regional locations. Strain 1 occurs predominantly in Asia, the Pacific region, and East Africa; strain 4, in West Africa and the Caribbean; strain 3 in Europe, North Africa, and the Americas; and strain 2 only in Ethiopia, [[Malawi]], Nepal, north India, and [[New Caledonia]].

On the basis of this, they offer a map of the dissemination of leprosy in the world. This confirms the spread of the disease along the migration, colonisation, and slave trade routes taken from East Africa to India, West Africa to the New World, and from Africa into Europe and vice versa.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Monot |first1=Marc |last2=Honoré |first2=Nadine |last3=Garnier |first3=Thierry |last4=Araoz |first4=Romul |last5=Coppée |first5=Jean-Yves |last6=Lacroix |first6=Céline |last7=Sow |first7=Samba |last8=Spencer |first8=John S. |last9=Truman |first9=Richard W. |last10=Williams |first10=Diana L. |last11=Gelber |first11=Robert |last12=Virmond |first12=Marcos |last13=Flageul |first13=Béatrice |last14=Cho |first14=Sang-Nae |last15=Ji |first15=Baohong |last16=Paniz-Mondolfi |first16=Alberto |last17=Convit |first17=Jacinto |last18=Young |first18=Saroj |last19=Fine |first19=Paul E. |last20=Rasolofo |first20=Voahangy |last21=Brennan |first21=Patrick J. |last22=Cole |first22=Stewart T. |title=On the Origin of Leprosy |journal=Science |volume=308 |issue=5724 |pages=1040–1042 |date=13 May 2005 |doi=10.1126/science/1109759 |pmid=15894530|s2cid=86109194 |url=https://hal-pasteur.archives-ouvertes.fr/pasteur-00204117/document }}</ref>

Although retrospectively identifying descriptions of leprosy-like symptoms is difficult, what appears to be leprosy was discussed by [[Hippocrates]] in 460 BC. In 1846, Francis Adams produced ''The Seven Books of Paulus Aegineta'' which included a commentary on all medical and surgical knowledge and descriptions and remedies to do with leprosy from the Romans, Greeks, and Arabs.<ref>Francis Adams, ''The Seven Books of Paulus Aegineta: Translated from the Greek with Commentary Embracing a Complete View of the Knowledge Possessed by the Greeks, Romans and Arabians on all Subjects Connected with Medicine and Surgery'', 3 vols.

Skeletal remains from the second millennium BCE, discovered in 2009, represent the oldest documented evidence for leprosy. Located at Balathal, in Rajasthan, northwest India, the discoverers suggest that if the disease did migrate from Africa to India, during the third millennium BCE "at a time when there was substantial interaction among the Indus Civilization, Mesopotamia, and Egypt, there needs to be additional skeletal and molecular evidence of leprosy in India and Africa so as to confirm the African origin of the disease."<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Robbins |first1=Gwen |last2=Tripathy |first2=V.

[[British Raj|British India]] enacted the Leprosy Act of 1898 which institutionalized those affected and segregated them by sex to prevent reproduction.  The act was difficult to enforce but was repealed in 1983 only after multidrug therapy had become widely available.  In 1983, the National Leprosy Elimination Programme, previously the National Leprosy Control Programme, changed its methods from surveillance to the treatment of people with leprosy.

The Hebraic root tsara or [[tsaraath]] (צָרַע,—tsaw-rah'—to be struck with leprosy, to be leprous) and the Greek (λεπρός—lepros), are of broader classification than the more narrow use of the term related to Hansen's Disease.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Grzybowski|first1=Andrzej|last2=Nita|first2=Małgorzata|date=2016-01-01|title=Leprosy in the Bible|journal=Clinics in Dermatology|volume=34|issue=1|pages=3–7|doi=10.1016/j.clindermatol.2015.10.003|pmid=26773616|issn=0738-081X}}</ref> Any progressive skin disease (a whitening or splotchy bleaching of skin, raised manifestations of scales, scabs, infections, rashes, etc....) as well as generalized molds and surface discoloration of any clothing, leather, or discoloration on walls or surfaces throughout homes all came under the "law of leprosy" (Leviticus 14:54–57).<ref>[See:  Orr, James, M.A., D.D.

==== Norway ====
Norway was the location of a progressive stance on leprosy tracking and treatment and played an influential role in European understanding of the disease. In 1832, Dr. JJ Hjort conducted the first leprosy survey, thus establishing a basis for epidemiological surveys. Subsequent surveys resulted in the establishment of a national leprosy registry to study the causes of leprosy and for tracking of the rate of infection.

Early leprosy research throughout Europe was conducted by Norwegian scientists [[Daniel Cornelius Danielssen]] and [[Carl Wilhelm Boeck]]. Their work resulted in the establishment of the National Leprosy Research and Treatment Center. Danielssen and Boeck believed the cause of leprosy transmission was hereditary. This stance was influential in advocating for the isolation of those infected by sex to prevent reproduction.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Genetic susceptibility to leprosy|last=Alter|first=Andrea|year=2010|isbn=978-0-494-72613-6|location=McGill University (Canada)}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=  https://snl.no/Daniel_Cornelius_Danielssen|title=  Daniel Cornelius Danielssen|publisher=  Store norske leksikon|author=  Svein Atle Skålevåg|access-date=  January 1, 2017|url-status=  live|archive-url=  https://web.archive.org/web/20170113154202/https://snl.no/Daniel_Cornelius_Danielssen|archive-date=  January 13, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= https://snl.no/Carl_Wilhelm_Boeck|title= Carl Wilhelm Boeck|publisher= Store norske leksikon|author= Svein Atle Skålevåg|access-date= January 1, 2017|url-status=live|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170113170144/https://snl.no/Carl_Wilhelm_Boeck|archive-date= January 13, 2017|date= 2014-09-28}}</ref>

==== Colonialism and imperialism ====
[[File:Father Damien on his deathbed.jpg|thumb|[[Father Damien]] on his deathbed in 1889]]
Though leprosy in Europe was again on the decline by the 1860s, Western countries embraced isolation treatment out of fear of the spread of disease from [[Developing country|developing countries]], minimal understanding of bacteriology, lack of diagnostic ability or knowledge of how contagious the disease was, and missionary activity.<ref name=":1">{{Cite book|title=Leprosy, Racism, and Public Health|last=Gussow|first=Zachary|publisher=Westview Press|year=1989|isbn=978-0-8133-0674-2|location=Boulder, Colorado}}</ref>  Growing [[imperialism]] and pressures of the [[Industrial Revolution|industrial revolution]] resulted in a Western presence in countries where leprosy was endemic, namely the [[British Raj|British presence in India]].  Isolation treatment methods were observed by Surgeon-Mayor [[Henry Vandyke Carter]] of the British Colony in India while visiting Norway, and these methods were applied in India with the financial and logistical assistance of religious [[missionaries]].  [[Colonialism|Colonial]] and religious influence and associated stigma continued to be a major factor in the treatment and public perception of leprosy in endemic developing countries until the mid-twentieth century.<ref name=":1" />

=== Stigma ===
{{See also|Leprosy stigma}}
Despite effective treatment and education efforts, leprosy stigma continues to be problematic in developing countries where the disease is common. Leprosy is most common amongst impoverished or marginalized populations where social stigma is likely to be compounded by other social inequities. Fears of ostracism, loss of employment, or expulsion from family and society may contribute to a delayed diagnosis and treatment.

Folk beliefs, lack of education, and religious connotations of the disease continue to influence social perceptions of those afflicted in many parts of the world. In [[Brazil]], for example, folklore holds that leprosy is transmitted by dogs, it is a disease associated with sexual promiscuity, and is sometimes thought to be a punishment for sins or moral transgressions (distinct from other diseases and misfortunes in general being accorded to the will of [[God]]).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=White|first=Cassandra|date=2005|title=Explaining a Complex Disease Process: Talking to Patients about Hansen's Disease (Leprosy) in Brazil|jstor=3655365|journal=Medical Anthropology Quarterly|issn=0745-5194|pmid=16222964|volume=19|issue=3|pages=310–330|doi=10.1525/maq.2005.19.3.310}}</ref> Socioeconomic factors also have a direct impact. Lower-class domestic workers who are often employed by those in a higher socioeconomic class may find their employment in jeopardy as physical manifestations of the disease become apparent. Skin discoloration and darker pigmentation resulting from the disease also have social repercussions.

In extreme cases in northern India, leprosy is equated with an "untouchable" status that "often persists long after individuals with leprosy have been cured of the disease, creating lifelong prospects of divorce, eviction, loss of employment, and ostracism from family and social networks."<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Barret|first=Ronald|date=June 2005|title=Self-Mortification and the Stigma of Leprosy in Northern India|jstor=3655487|journal=Medical Anthropology Quarterly|issn=1548-1387|pmid=15974328|volume=19|issue=2|pages=216–230|doi=10.1525/maq.2005.19.2.216}}</ref>

=== Programs and treatment ===
The WHO states that diagnosis and treatment with multidrug therapy are easy and effective, and a 45% decline in disease burden has occurred since multidrug therapy has become more widely available. The organization emphasizes the importance of fully integrating leprosy treatment into public health services, effective diagnosis and treatment, and access to information.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.who.int/lep/en/|title=Leprosy elimination: World Health Organization|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140314203445/http://www.who.int/lep/en/|archive-date=2014-03-14|url-status=live|access-date=2019-07-03}}</ref>

In some instances in India, community-based rehabilitation is embraced by local governments and NGOs alike.  Often, the identity cultivated by a community environment is preferable to reintegration, and models of self-management and collective agency independent of NGOs and government support have been desirable and successful.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Staples|first=James|date=2014|title=Communities of the afflicted: constituting leprosy through place in South India |journal=Medical Anthropology: Cross-Cultural Studies in Health and Illness|doi=10.1080/01459740.2012.714021|pmid=24383749 |volume=33|issue=1|pages=6–20|s2cid=24595253|url=https://zenodo.org/record/890651}}</ref>
