'''''A River Runs Through It and Other Stories''''' is a [[autobiographical novel|semi-autobiographical]] [[anthology|collection]] of three stories by American author [[Norman Maclean]] (1902–1990) published in 1976. It was the first work of fiction published by the [[University of Chicago Press]].

The collection contains the [[novella]] "A River Runs Through It" and two [[short story|short stories]], "Logging and Pimping and 'Your pal, Jim'" and "USFS 1919: The Ranger, the Cook, and a Hole in the Sky", which precede the events of the novella. It received widespread acclaim upon its publication and was nominated for the [[Pulitzer Prize]] in Letters in 1977, but the selection committee ultimately did not award the prize in that category that year. Two of the stories were later adapted into feature films.

=="A River Runs Through It"==

[[File:Montana - locations in River runs through it.svg|thumb|Locations in western [[Montana]] from "A River Runs Through It"]]
"A River Runs Through It" is a semi-autobiographical account of Maclean's relationship with his brother Paul and their upbringing in an early [[20th-century]] [[Montana]] family in which "there was no clear line between religion and [[fly fishing]]." Pete Dexter, in a 1981 profile of Maclean in [[Esquire (magazine)|''Esquire'' magazine]], described the novella:

{{quote|text=It is a story about Maclean and his brother, Paul, who was beaten to death with a gun butt in 1938. It is about not understanding what you love, about not being able to help. It is the truest story I ever read; it might be the best written. And to this day it won’t leave me alone. I thought for a while it was the writing that kept bringing it around. That’s the way it comes back to me: I hear the sound of the words, then I see them happen. I spent four hours one afternoon picking out three paragraphs to drop into a column I was writing about the book, and in the end they didn’t translate, because except for the first sentence—'In our family, there was no clear line between religion and fly-fishing'—there isn’t anything in it that doesn’t depend on what comes before it for its meaning.<ref>{{cite news

As he describes his brother's [[alcoholism]] and [[gambling addiction]], Maclean also explores how both afflictions have always followed the history of his family, even back to their earliest origins among [[Scottish Gaelic]]-speaking [[Presbyterian]]s on the [[Isle of Mull]].

The story is noted for using detailed descriptions of fishing and the [[Montana]] landscape to engage with a number of profound [[metaphysical]] questions.<ref>Cooper, David B. - "Hooked on Fly-Fishing, Good Writing". - ''[[Akron Beacon Journal]]''. - August 12, 1990.<br>—Reed, Leonard. - "Filming the Beauty of Words". - [[The Record (Bergen County)|''The Record'']]. - October 13, 1992.<br>—Judd, Ron. - "Fishing Prose Hooks Readers". - ''[[The Seattle Times]]''. - April 13, 1995.</ref> In a review for the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', critic [[Alfred Kazin]] stated: "There are passages here of physical rapture in the presence of unsullied primitive America that are as beautiful as anything in [[Thoreau]] and [[Ernest Hemingway|Hemingway]]".<ref>Kazin, Alfred. - "Frontiers of True Feeling - Norman Maclean's Montana Classic". - ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''. - August 6, 1989.</ref>

=="Logging and Pimping and 'Your pal, Jim'"==

"Logging and Pimping and 'Your pal, Jim'" tells the story of Maclean working as a logger for the Anaconda Company at a logging camp on the [[Blackfoot River (Montana)|Blackfoot River]] during the summer of 1928, when he was 25 and in graduate school. At the end of the previous summer working at the camp (1927), Maclean had made an arrangement to work the next summer with the camp's best logger, Jim Grierson.<ref name=MacleanN-pp115-135>Maclean, Norman (1992). - "Logging and Pimping and 'Your pal, Jim'". - ''A River Runs Through It and Other Stories''. -  New York, New York: Pocket Books (Simon & Schuster). - pp.115-135. - {{ISBN|0-671-77697-5}}.</ref> Maclean describes how Grierson would work the logging season at a camp, then find a town with a nice [[Carnegie library|Carnegie Public Library]], get a library card, find a whore, preferably from the [[Southern United States|South]], and spend the off-season reading, drinking, and having a relationship with the prostitute.<ref name=MacleanN-pp115-135 />

=="USFS 1919: The Ranger, the Cook, and a Hole in the Sky"==

"USFS 1919: The Ranger, the Cook, and a Hole in the Sky" tells of part of the summer of Maclean's seventeenth year, 1919. He spent that summer, as he had the previous two, working for the [[United States Forest Service]], this time at Elk Summit, [[Idaho]], west of [[Blodgett Canyon]] and approximately {{convert|34|mi|km}} walking distance almost due west-northwest of [[Hamilton, Montana]], near White Sand Creek, and north of East Fork Moose Creek.<ref name=MacleanN-pp137-237>Maclean, Norman (1992). - "USFS 1919: The Ranger, the Cook, and a Hole in the Sky". - ''A River Runs Through It and Other Stories''. -  New York, New York: Pocket Books (Simon & Schuster). - pp.137-237. - {{ISBN|0-671-77697-5}}.</ref>

Working for the Forest Service in a very remote part of the [[Selway-Bitterroot Wilderness]] in the Selway National Forest (now [[Clearwater National Forest]]), Maclean had to extinguish wildfires, build trails (with sledgehammer, chisel and dynamite), pack horses and mules, spend time alone on lookout duty at {{convert|7424|ft|m}} Grave Peak, and string telephone wire.<ref name=MacleanN-pp137-237 />

The Elk Summit Work Center is located at the junction of Horse Creek and Hoodoo Creek, north-northwest of Hoodoo Mountain and north-northeast of Hoodoo Lake, at {{coord|46|19|36|N|114|38|51|W|type:landmark_region:US-ID}} (46.3265874, -114.6476053)<ref name="GR1">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/gazette.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref> and an elevation of {{convert|5748|ft|m}}.

==Publishing history==

''A River Runs Through It and Other Stories'' was first published by the [[University of Chicago Press]] in May 1976, and has since been published in several formats: as a collection of short stories, bearing a title starting with that of the novella, and as a standalone novella, usually as an art book with many photographs or with many illustrations such as [[woodcut]]s. For much of its publishing history it was purposely not advertised, its publicity depending on [[word of mouth]] and critical mention. Talk of the "never advertised" book generated a considerable amount of publicity.

A hardcover illustrated version issued in [[Chicago]] by the University of Chicago Press in 1989 with {{ISBN|0-226-50060-8}} is still in print. The anthology of short stories with the novella, ''A River Runs Through It and Other Stories'', was issued as a paperback by the University of Chicago Press in 2003 with {{ISBN|0-226-50066-7}}.

==Pulitzer Prize==
In 1977, the [[Pulitzer Prize]] committee for [[Pulitzer Prize for Fiction|Fiction]] (a.k.a. "fiction jury") recommended ''A River Runs Through It'' be awarded the prize for that year. The Pulitzer Prize Board, which has final say for awarding the prize, chose to override their recommendation and decided not to award for fiction that year.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/05/11/books/publishing-pulitzer-controversies.html|last=McDowell|first=Edwin|title=Publishing: Pulitzer Controversies|publisher=NYtimes.com|date=May 11, 1984|accessdate=2009-02-28}}</ref> [[Pete Dexter]] wrote in 1981 that the jury called it "a lean year for fiction" but speculated about their true reasons: "I know just enough about the Pulitzer people to guess that what happened was that one of them noticed the trees too."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://classic.esquire.com/article/1981/6/1/the-old-man-and-the-river|title=The Old Man and the River &#124; Esquire &#124; JUNE 1981|first=PETE|last=DEXTER|website=Esquire &#124; The Complete Archive|accessdate=Dec 4, 2020}}</ref>

:“At that moment I knew, surely and clearly, that I was witnessing perfection.
