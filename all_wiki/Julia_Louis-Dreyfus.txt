As part of her comedic training, Louis-Dreyfus appeared in [[The Second City]], one of Chicago's best-known improvisational theatre groups, whose alumni include [[Alan Arkin]], [[Steve Carell]], [[Stephen Colbert]], [[Tina Fey]], [[Amy Poehler]], [[Shelley Long]], [[John Belushi]], [[Dan Aykroyd]], [[Bill Murray]], [[John Candy]], [[Chris Farley]], [[Bob Odenkirk]] and many, many others who went on to become successful comedians and pop culture icons. It was her performance with [[The Practical Theatre Company]] at their "Golden 50th Anniversary Jubilee" that led to her being asked to join the cast of [[NBC]]'s ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' at the age of 21.

Louis-Dreyfus subsequently became a cast member on ''Saturday Night Live'' from 1982 to 1985, the youngest female cast member in the history of the program at that time.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.insider.com/where-are-they-now-snl-cast-members-2019-7|title= WHERE ARE THEY NOW: All 152 cast members in 'Saturday Night Live' history|website= [[Insider Inc.]]|accessdate= May 11, 2020}}</ref> During her time on ''SNL'', she appeared alongside several actors who would later rise to prominence, such as [[Eddie Murphy]], [[Jim Belushi]], [[Billy Crystal]], and [[Martin Short]].

In 1987 Louis-Dreyfus appeared in the NBC sitcom pilot ''The Art of Being Nick'', an intended spin-off from ''[[Family Ties]]'' starring [[Scott Valentine (actor)|Scott Valentine]]. When the pilot did not make it to series, Louis-Dreyfus was retained by producer [[Gary David Goldberg]] for a role on his new sitcom ''[[Day by Day (American TV series)|Day by Day]]'', as the sarcastic and materialistic neighbor, Eileen Swift. Premiering in early 1988, ''Day by Day'' aired for two seasons on NBC before being cancelled.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aoltv.com/2008/05/08/short-lived-shows-day-by-day-video/|url-status=dead|title=Short-Lived Shows: Day By Day - VIDEO|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016155552/http://www.aoltv.com/2008/05/08/short-lived-shows-day-by-day-video/ |archive-date=October 16, 2015|date=May 8, 2008|website=AOL TV|last=Sassone|first=Bob}}</ref>

===1989–1998: ''Seinfeld'' and widespread recognition===
[[File:Julia Louis-Dreyfus (2078586922).jpg|thumb|upright|left|Louis-Dreyfus at the [[47th Primetime Emmy Awards|47th Emmy Awards ceremony]] in September 1995]]
In the early 1990s, Louis-Dreyfus became famous for the role of [[Elaine Benes]] on NBC's ''[[Seinfeld]]''. She played the role for nine seasons, appearing in all but three episodes.<ref name="actors"/> One of the episodes that she did not appear in was the pilot episode, "[[The Seinfeld Chronicles]]", because her character was not initially intended to be a part of the series. It was only after the first episode that [[NBC]] executives felt the show was too male-centric, and demanded that creators [[Larry David]] and [[Jerry Seinfeld]] add a woman to the cast. It was revealed in the commentary on the DVD package that the addition of a female character was the condition for commissioning the show. Louis-Dreyfus won the role over several other actresses who would also eventually enjoy their own TV success, including [[Patricia Heaton]] and [[Megan Mullally]].<ref>[http://au.askmen.com/entertainment/special_feature_150/164_special_feature.html "5 Things You Didn't Know: Seinfeld"] Askmen.com</ref>

On the "Notes About Nothing" featurette on the [[DVD]] package, Seinfeld says that Louis-Dreyfus' ability to eat a peanut [[M&M's|M&M]] without breaking the peanut aptly describes the actress: "She cracks you up without breaking your nuts."

Louis-Dreyfus garnered critical acclaim for her performance on the series, and she was a regular winner and nominee at television award shows throughout the 1990s. Her performance earned her two [[Golden Globe Award]] nominations, winning once in 1994, nine [[Screen Actors Guild Award]] nominations, winning one in 1995 and two in both 1997 and 1998, and seven [[American Comedy Awards]], winning five times in 1993, 1994, 1995, 1997 and 1998. In 1996, she won the [[Primetime Emmy Award]]<ref>[http://www.emmys.com/celebrities/julia-louis-dreyfus Julia Louis-Dreyfus Emmy Nominated]. Emmys.com.</ref> for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series, an award she was nominated for on seven occasions from 1992 to 1998. After receiving the award, Louis-Dreyfus claimed the win was a "shocker", and that after being in both positions, it was "much better to win than to lose."<ref>[http://www.people.com/people/julia_louis-dreyfus/biography Bio] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304061010/http://www.people.com/people/julia_louis-dreyfus/biography |date=March 4, 2016 }} Celebrity Central/Top 25 Celebs, ''People''</ref>

In 1998, Jerry Seinfeld decided to end the series after nine seasons. The [[The Finale (Seinfeld)|series finale]] aired on May 14 and was one of the most-watched TV events in history, with over 76 million viewers tuning in.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/05/16/arts/rating-for-seinfeld-finale-grazed-super-bowl-country.html | work=The New York Times | first=Bill | last=Carter | title=Rating for 'Seinfeld' Finale Grazed Super Bowl Country | date=May 16, 1998}}</ref>

During her time on ''Seinfeld'' she appeared in several films, including ''[[Fathers' Day (1997 film)|Fathers' Day]]'', opposite [[Robin Williams]] and [[Billy Crystal]], and [[Woody Allen]]'s Oscar-nominated ''[[Deconstructing Harry]]''.

===1999–2004: Post-''Seinfeld''===
Following a voice role in the highly successful [[Pixar]] film ''[[A Bug's Life]]'', Louis-Dreyfus lent her voice as [[Snake (The Simpsons)|Snake]]'s girlfriend Gloria in ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode "[[A Hunka Hunka Burns in Love]]". In 2001, she made several special guest appearances on ''Seinfeld'' co-creator [[Larry David]]'s show ''[[Curb Your Enthusiasm]]'', playing herself fictionally trying to break the "curse" by planning to star in a show in which she would play an actress affected by a ''Seinfeld''-like curse.

After several years away from a regular TV job, Louis-Dreyfus began a new single-camera sitcom, ''[[Watching Ellie]]'', which premiered on NBC in February 2002. The series was created by husband [[Brad Hall]], and co-starred [[Steve Carell]] and Louis-Dreyfus' half-sister [[Lauren Bowles]]. The initial premise of the show was to present viewers with a "slice of life" from the goings-on and happenings of the life of Ellie Riggs, a Southern California jazz singer. The first season included a 22-minute countdown kept digitally in the lower left-hand corner of the screen, which many critics panned, claiming it was useless and "did nothing for the show."<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.variety.com/review/VE1117917072 | work=Variety | first=Phil | last=Gallo | title=Watching Ellie | date=February 23, 2002}}</ref> Overall, the show received mixed reviews, but debuted strongly with over 16 million viewers tuning in for the series premiere, and maintained an average audience of about 10 million viewers per week.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/television/2002/2002-05-28-year-end-chart.htm|title=How did your favorite show rate?|work=[[USA Today]]|date=28 May 2002}}</ref>

When the series returned for a second season in the spring of 2003, it suffered a decline in viewership, averaging around eight million viewers per week. The show had undergone a drastic stylistic change between production of seasons one and two. The first season was filmed in the single-camera format, but the second season was presented as a traditional multicamera sitcom filmed in front of a live studio audience.<ref name=op>[http://old.post-gazette.com/tv/20030414owen0414fnp4.asp "TV Review: NBC's retooled 'Ellie' vastly more watchable"] April 14, 2003, ''Post Gazette''</ref> With dwindling viewership and failing to retain the numbers from its ''[[Frasier]]'' lead-in, the series was cancelled by NBC in May 2003.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.seattlepi.com/ae/tv/article/NBC-s-fall-lineup-is-looking-a-lot-like-its-1114511.php | work=Seattle Post-Intelligencer | first1=Melanie | last1=Mcfarland | title=NBC's fall lineup is looking a lot like its current one | date=November 5, 2003}}</ref>

Following NBC's cancellation of ''Watching Ellie'', the media began circulating rumors of a so-called "[[Seinfeld curse]]", which claimed that none of the former ''Seinfeld'' actors could ever achieve success again in the television industry. Louis-Dreyfus dismissed the rumor as "a made-up thing by the media",<ref name=op/> while ''Seinfeld'' co-creator Larry David asserted that the curse was "completely idiotic."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.gregbaerg.com/articles/David.html|title='Curb's' Larry David: 'Seinfeld' Curse 'Idiotic'|first=Greg|last=Baerg|publisher=Zap2It.com|agency=[[Knight Ridder]] / [[Tribune Content Agency|Tribune News Service]] September 7, 2001)|via=Gregbaerg.com|archive-date=January 3, 2013|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130103003650/http://www.gregbaerg.com/articles/David.html|url-status=live|access-date=July 12, 2012}}</ref>

Louis-Dreyfus was interested in the role of [[Susan Mayer]] on ''[[Desperate Housewives]]'', the role that ultimately went to [[Teri Hatcher]].<ref>[http://www.aoltv.com/2006/05/04/desperate-networks-is-a-must-read-for-tv-fans/ "Desperate Networks is a must-read for TV fans"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016155552/http://www.aoltv.com/2006/05/04/desperate-networks-is-a-must-read-for-tv-fans/ |date=October 16, 2015 }} May 4, 2006, ''The Huffington Post''</ref> Instead, Louis-Dreyfus scored a recurring guest role as Maggie Lizer, the deceitful prosecutor and love interest of [[Michael Bluth]] on the Emmy-winning comedy ''[[Arrested Development (TV series)|Arrested Development]]'', from 2004 to 2005.
