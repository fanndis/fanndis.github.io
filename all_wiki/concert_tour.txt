A '''concert tour''' (or simply '''tour''') is a series of [[concert]]s by an artist or group of artists in different cities, countries or locations.  Often concert tours are named to differentiate different tours by the same artist and to associate a specific tour with a particular album or product.  Especially in the popular music world, such tours can become large-scale enterprises that last for several months or even years, are seen by hundreds of thousands or millions of people, and bring in millions of dollars in ticket revenues. A performer who embarks on a concert tour is called a '''touring artist'''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/photos/live/488653/hot-tours-roger-waters-mana-bob-dylan|title=Hot Tours: Roger Waters, Mana, Bob Dylan|website=Billboard|access-date=2018-05-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180523041441/https://www.billboard.com/articles/photos/live/488653/hot-tours-roger-waters-mana-bob-dylan|archive-date=2018-05-23|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/7271843/madonna-extends-record-highest-grossing-solo-touring-artist |title=Madonna Extends Record as Highest-Grossing Solo Touring Artist |publisher=Billboard |date=2016-03-23 |access-date=2019-05-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181204051754/https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/7271843/madonna-extends-record-highest-grossing-solo-touring-artist |archive-date=2018-12-04 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Different segments of longer concert tours are known as "legs".<ref>{{cite web|title=What is a Concert Tour?|url=http://tourbeat.com/news-and-announcements/what-is-a-concert-tour|publisher=[[TourBeat]]|access-date=10 January 2015|quote=A concert tour is an opportunity for musicians to perform over longer periods of time across several cities, which are differentiated by segments known as "legs." Legs of tours of can be denoted by a series of dates that have no long break between them, by geographical regions or destinations, or by different opening acts. Each city or region may have the same opening act for each leg, or they may change opening acts at each city.|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150113003358/http://tourbeat.com/news-and-announcements/what-is-a-concert-tour|archive-date=13 January 2015|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The different legs of a tour are denoted in different ways, dependent on the artist and type of tour, but the most common means of separating legs are dates (especially if there is a long break at some point), countries and/or continents, or different opening acts.  In the largest concert tours it has become more common for different legs to employ separate touring production crews and equipment, local to each geographical region.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}  Concert tours are often administered on the local level by concert promoters or by [[performing arts presenters]]. Usually, small concert tours are managed by a [[road manager]] whereas large concert tours are managed by a [[tour manager]].

==Logistics==
The main challenge in concert tours is how to move the performance's logistics from one venue to another venue, especially for a transcontinental tour. Tour logistics should be very organized and everything has to happen on time and in the right order as planned.<ref name="inbound">{{cite web|url=http://www.inboundlogistics.com/cms/article/taking-the-show-on-the-road/|title=Taking the Show on the Road - Inbound Logistics|website=www.inboundlogistics.com|access-date=4 December 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201050950/http://www.inboundlogistics.com/cms/article/taking-the-show-on-the-road/|archive-date=1 December 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> ''[[Autoweek]]'' magazine estimated 30 to 50 trucks were required by [[Taylor Swift]]'s [[1989 World Tour]] to bring all the stage, sound equipment, instruments, props, and clothes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://autoweek.com/article/car-news/how-many-trucks-does-it-take-put-taylor-swift-show|title=How many trucks does it take to put on a Taylor Swift show?|website=autoweek.com|access-date=4 December 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201044551/http://autoweek.com/article/car-news/how-many-trucks-does-it-take-put-taylor-swift-show|archive-date=1 December 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> When [[Beyoncé]] visited the United Kingdom with her 2016 [[Formation World Tour]], it took seven [[Boeing 747]] air freighters and a fleet of more than 70 trucks to get her stage set and other gear to the venues.

The mobility of concert tours requires a lot of costs, times, and energy.
