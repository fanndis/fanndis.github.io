{{Politics of New Zealand |expanded=Executive}}
The '''prime minister of New Zealand''' ('''PM'''; {{lang-mi|Te pirimia o Aotearoa}}) is the [[head of government]] of [[New Zealand]]. The {{as of | 2018 | alt = incumbent}} prime minister, [[Jacinda Ardern]], leader of the [[New Zealand Labour Party]], took office on 26 October 2017.<ref name="NZHeraldConfidence">{{Cite news |url= http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=11934957 |title= Green Party ratifies confidence and supply deal with Labour |date= 19 October 2017 |work= [[The New Zealand Herald]] |access-date= 24 October 2017}}</ref><ref name="GG">{{Cite press release |title= The Governor-General's role in a General Election |publisher=The Governor-General of New Zealand |url= https://www.gg.govt.nz/publications/governor-generals-role-general-election}}</ref>

The prime minister ranks as the most senior [[Ministers in the New Zealand Government|government minister]]. They are responsible for chairing meetings of [[Cabinet of New Zealand|Cabinet]]; allocating posts to ministers within the [[New Zealand Government|government]]; acting as the spokesperson for the government; and providing [[advice (constitutional)|advice]] to the [[monarchy of New Zealand|sovereign]] or the sovereign's representative, the [[Governor-General of New Zealand|governor-general]]. They also have ministerial responsibility for the [[Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet (New Zealand)|Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet]].

The office exists by a long-established [[constitutional convention (political custom)|convention]], which originated in New Zealand's former colonial power, the then [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]]. The convention stipulates that the governor-general must select as prime minister the person most likely to command the support, or confidence, of the [[New Zealand House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]. This individual is typically the [[parliamentary leader]] of the [[List of political parties in New Zealand|political party]] that holds the largest number of seats in that house.{{efn|Convention merely requires that the prime minister's government can survive a [[motion of no-confidence]]. As a practical necessity, the head of government is usually the leader of the party with a [[Plurality (voting)|plurality]] of seats in the House of Representatives. However, on rare occasion, she or he may lead a [[coalition government]] that outnumbers the single largest party.|group=notes}} The prime minister and Cabinet are collectively [[political accountability|accountable]] for their actions to the governor-general, to the House of Representatives, to their political party, and ultimately to the national electorate.

Originally the head of government was titled [[Colonial Secretary of New Zealand|"colonial secretary"]] or "[[first minister]]". This was changed in 1869 to "[[premier]]". That title remained in use for more than 30 years, until [[Richard Seddon]] informally changed it to "[[prime minister]]" in 1901 during his tenure in the office.<ref name="title"/> Following the declaration of New Zealand as a [[Dominion of New Zealand|Dominion]] in 1907, the title of Prime Minister has been used exclusively in English. In Māori, the title ''{{lang|mi|pirimia}}'', meaning "premier", continues to be used.<ref>{{citation |editor1-last=Moorfield |editor1-first=John C |title=Pirimia |url=https://maoridictionary.co.nz/search?idiom=&phrase=&proverb=&loan=&histLoanWords=&keywords=pirimia |website=Te Aka Online Māori Dictionary |publisher=[[Pearson plc|Pearson]] |accessdate=16 November 2018}}</ref> New Zealand prime ministers are [[Style (manner of address)|styled]] as "[[The Right Honourable]]", a privilege they retain for life.<ref name="rt_hon">{{cite web|url= http://www.dpmc.govt.nz/honours/overview/rthon|title= The Right Honourable |publisher=[[Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet (New Zealand)|Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet]]|accessdate= 13 October 2012|language=en-NZ}}</ref>

==Appointment and tenure==
The governor-general appoints a prime minister, like other [[Ministers in the New Zealand Government|ministerial positions]], on behalf of the [[monarchy of New Zealand|monarch]]. By the conventions of [[responsible government]], the governor-general will call to form a government the individual most likely to receive the support, or confidence, of a majority of the elected [[Member of parliament#New Zealand|members of parliament]] (MPs).<ref name="cabinetmanual_pm">{{cite web|url= http://cabinetmanual.cabinetoffice.govt.nz/2.2|title=Prime Minister|work= Cabinet Manual|publisher=[[Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet (New Zealand)|Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet]]|year= 2008|accessdate= 21 September 2011}}</ref> In making this appointment, convention requires the governor-general to act on the outcome of the [[elections in New Zealand|electoral process]] and subsequent discussions between political parties by which the person who will lead the government as prime minister is identified.<ref name="cabinetmanual_pm"/> In practice, the position typically falls to an MP who is the [[parliamentary leader]] of the largest political party among those forming the government.<ref name="te ara">{{cite encyclopedia|first= Gavin|last= McLean|title= Premiers and prime ministers – The role of prime minister|url= http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/premiers-and-prime-ministers/page-1|encyclopedia= Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand|date= 1 December 2016|accessdate= 4 September 2016}}</ref>{{efn|The aftermath of the [[1931 New Zealand general election]] proved an exception.|group= notes}} The prime minister may lead a [[coalition government]] and/or a [[minority government]] dependent on support from smaller parties during [[confidence-and-supply]] votes.<ref>{{cite web|title= Parties and Government|url= https://www.parliament.nz/en/visit-and-learn/how-parliament-works/parliamentary-practice-in-new-zealand/chapter-8-parties-and-government/|publisher=New Zealand Parliament|accessdate= 20 December 2017|language= en}}</ref>

==Responsibilities and powers==
{{See also|New Zealand Government|Constitution of New Zealand}}
[[File:New Zealand Cabinet October 2017.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2 |The prime minister chairs meetings of Cabinet, where government policy is formulated.]]
The office is not defined by [[Codification (law)|codified]] laws, but by unwritten customs known as [[constitutional convention (political custom)|constitutional conventions]] which developed in Britain and were replicated in New Zealand. These conventions are for the most part founded on the underlying principle that the prime minister and fellow ministers must not lose the confidence of the democratically elected component of parliament, the House of Representatives. The prime minister is leader of the [[New Zealand Cabinet|Cabinet]] (itself a body existing by convention), and takes a coordinating role.<ref name="te ara" />

The ''[[Cabinet Manual (New Zealand)|Cabinet Manual]]'' provides an outline of the prime minister's powers and responsibilities.<ref name="cabinetmanual_pm"/>

=== Principal adviser to the sovereign ===
By constitutional convention, the prime minister holds formal power to [[Advice (constitutional)|advise]] the sovereign. This means that as long as the prime minister has the confidence of parliament, they alone may advise the monarch on:<ref name="cabinetmanual_pm"/>
* Appointment or [[wikt:Recall|recall]] of the governor-general.{{efn|group=notes|name=recall|The power of recall has never been exercised by a prime minister in New Zealand. Three governors were recalled during the colonial period, but on the advice of British ministers.}}
* Amendments to the [[Letters Patent Constituting the Office of Governor-General of New Zealand|Letters Patent Constituting the Office of Governor-General]], which most recently occurred in 2006.
* The conferment of [[New Zealand Royal Honours System|New Zealand honours]] (except for honours in the personal gift of the monarch).

===Principal adviser to the governor-general===
As head of government, the prime minister alone has the right to advise the governor-general to:
* Appoint, dismiss, or accept the resignation of ministers.<ref name="cabinetmanual_pm"/>
* Call general elections by advising the governor-general to [[dissolution of parliament|dissolve]] parliament.{{efn|group=notes|The prime minister is obligated to do so within three years of the previous election.}}<ref name="cabinetmanual_pm"/> The governor-general may reject the advice to dissolve parliament if the prime minister has recently lost a vote of confidence (that is, the governor-general would be using their [[reserve power]]s), but so far none have done so.<ref>{{cite web|title=Chapter 8 Parties and Government|url=https://www.parliament.nz/en/visit-and-learn/how-parliament-works/parliamentary-practice-in-new-zealand/chapter-8-parties-and-government/|publisher=New Zealand Parliament|accessdate=16 May 2018|language=en}}</ref>

===Head of government===
The prime minister is regarded by convention as "[[first among equals]]".<ref name="te ara"/> They do hold the most senior post in government, but are also required to adhere to any decisions taken by Cabinet, as per the convention of [[Cabinet collective responsibility|collective ministerial responsibility]]. The actual ability of a prime minister to give direct orders is largely limited; most of the position's power comes about through other means, such as:
* The ability to set the Cabinet agenda, thereby controlling items for discussion.<ref name="cabinetmanual_pm"/>{{efn|group=notes|Some political scientists have gone so far as to describe the Cabinet as the prime minister's '[[focus group]]'.<ref name="Cross">{{cite book|last1=Cross|first1=William P.|last2=Blais|first2=André|title=Politics at the Centre: The Selection and Removal of Party Leaders in the Anglo Parliamentary Democracies|date=2012|isbn=9780199596720|page=2}}</ref>}}
* The ability to appoint and dismiss ministers, and allocate [[wikt:portfolio|portfolios]].{{efn|group=notes|name=ministers|The extent to which this power can be exercised varies between parties; the [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour Party]], for example, places most of this responsibility in the hands of the [[caucus]], leaving the prime minister only with the power to choose which portfolios a minister is given.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Dowding |first1=Keith |last2=Dumont |first2=Patrick |title=The Selection of Ministers around the World |date=2014 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=9781317634454 |page=27 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UStHBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA27|language=en}}</ref> Furthermore, [[Electoral system of New Zealand|the MMP electoral system]] has complicated this, as a prime minister may have to consult with another party leader.}}
* The influence a prime minister is likely to have as leader of the dominant party. These powers may give more direct control over subordinates than is attached to the prime minister's role.<ref name="Cross"/>
* The power gained simply from being central to most significant decision-making, and from being able to comment on and criticise any decisions taken by other ministers.

Since the introduction of [[Electoral system of New Zealand|the MMP electoral system]], there has been an increased need for the prime minister to be able to negotiate and maintain relationships with support parties, which places some constraints on their abilities.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title=New Zealand Government and Politics|last=Hayward|first=Margaret|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2015|isbn=978-0-19-558525-4|location=Auckland|pages=371–373}}</ref>

=== Other roles and functions ===

Prime Minister John Key addresses the nation live on television following the earthquake that devastated Christchurch on 22 February 2011. Providing reassurance and leadership at times of national crisis is the traditional responsibility of the prime minister.
}}

The prime minister is also expected to take on additional portfolios.<ref name="te ara"/> Historically, the prime minister looked after colonial and revenue portfolios. As New Zealand expanded, the role of [[Minister of Finance (New Zealand)|minister of finance]] became too big; Prime Minister [[Robert Muldoon|Sir Robert Muldoon]] was criticised for taking on the finance portfolio during his time in office as it resulted in a large concentration of power in one individual.<ref name="te ara"/>

Before 1987, it was also common for prime ministers to take the role of [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (New Zealand)|minister of foreign affairs]], so they could represent New Zealand on an international stage.<ref name=":0" /> More recent prime ministers have taken portfolios relevant to their interests, or to promote specific areas they saw as important. For example, [[David Lange]] took the education portfolio in his second term; [[Helen Clark]] took the role of [[Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage]]; [[John Key]] was [[Minister of Tourism (New Zealand)|Minister for Tourism]]; and [[Jacinda Ardern]] is Minister for Child Poverty Reduction.<ref name="te ara"/>

Although no longer likely to be the minister of foreign affairs, the prime minister is still responsible for welcoming foreign heads of government, visiting leaders overseas, and attending [[Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting]]s.<ref name=":0" />

Conventionally, the prime minister is the responsible minister for the [[Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet (New Zealand)|Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet]] (DPMC), which is tasked with supporting the policy agenda of Cabinet through policy advice and the coordination of the implementation of key government programmes.<ref name=":0" /><ref name="Support">{{cite encyclopedia|title=Premiers and prime ministers – Support Services and Statues|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/premiers-and-prime-ministers/page-5|encyclopedia=Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand|accessdate=4 December 2016}}</ref> Under the [[Fifth National Government of New Zealand|Fifth National Government]] the DPMC expanded to give prime ministers greater supervision of [[national security|security]] and intelligence. The prime minister was also responsible for the [[New Zealand Security Intelligence Service|New Zealand Security and Intelligence Service]] (NZSIS) and the [[Government Communications Security Bureau]] (GCSB).<ref name=":0" />

==Salary and perquisites==
Under the Remuneration Authority Act 1977, and the Members of Parliament (Remuneration and Services) Act 2013, a prime minister's salary is determined annually by the Remuneration Authority, an independent body established by parliament to set salaries for members of parliament and other government officials.<ref>{{cite web|title=Clients' remuneration: Members of Parliament, including the Prime Minister and Ministers|url=http://remauthority.govt.nz/clients-remuneration/remuneration-for-members-of-parliament-including-the-prime-minister-and-ministers/|publisher=The Remuneration Authority|accessdate=4 December 2016}}</ref> MPs' salaries have been temporarily reduced during the [[COVID-19 pandemic in New Zealand]]—the prime minister's salary {{update after|2021|01|01||reason=these are temporary provisions|text=currently}} is [[NZ$]]376,840.<ref>{{cite web |title=Parliamentary Salaries and Allowances (Temporary Reduction—COVID-19) Determination 2020 (LI 2020/114) |url=http://www.legislation.govt.nz/regulation/public/2020/0114/latest/whole.html#LMS353922 |website=www.legislation.govt.nz |publisher=New Zealand Parliamentary Counsel Office |date=2020 |accessdate=11 August 2020}}</ref> In addition, like all other ministers and MPs, the prime minister receives annual allowances for travel and lodging, as do the prime minister's spouse and children.<ref>{{cite web|title=Members of Parliament (Accommodation Services for Members and Travel Services for Family Members and Former Prime Ministers) Determination 2014|url=http://www.legislation.govt.nz/regulation/public/2014/0287/latest/whole.html?search=ts_act%40bill%40regulation%40deemedreg_members+of+parliament_resel_25_a&p=1#DLM6243434|website=New Zealand Legislation|publisher=Parliamentary Counsel Office|accessdate=4 December 2016}}</ref>

The separate Private Office of the Prime Minister provides advice and support on political party matters.<ref name="Support"/>

The [[style (manner of address)|style]] of "[[The Right Honourable]]" (abbreviated to "The Rt Hon") is always granted to the prime minister upon taking office. Former prime ministers retain this style for the remainder of their lives.<ref name="rt_hon"/> The written form of address for the head of government should use their full parliamentary title as applicable: ''The Right Honourable [name], [post-nominal letters], Prime Minister of New Zealand''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Titles and styles of knights and dames|url=https://www.dpmc.govt.nz/our-programmes/new-zealand-royal-honours/honours-lists-and-recipients/information-honours-recipients/titles-styles-knights-dames|publisher=The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet.|accessdate=21 December 2017|language=en-NZ}}</ref> It is also traditional for the monarch to bestow a [[knighthood]] on prime ministers after they leave office,<ref>{{cite news |title=Editorial: John Key knighthood follows long tradition of honouring PMs |url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/opinion/93327810/editorial-john-key-knighthood-follows-long-tradition-of-honouring-pms |accessdate=14 September 2019 |work=[[Stuff (website)|Stuff]] |date=5 June 2017 |language=en}}</ref> and two prime ministers were knighted while still in office (namely [[Keith Holyoake|Sir Keith Holyoake]] in 1970,<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=45119 |date=5 June 1970 |page=6405 |supp=y }}</ref> and [[Robert Muldoon|Sir Robert Muldoon]] in 1983<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=49584 |date=30 December 1983 |page=33 |supp=y}}</ref>).

Should a serving or former prime minister die, she or he is accorded a [[state funeral]] (subject to the approval of the family). Two prime ministers who died in office were buried in mausoleums: [[William Massey]] (died 1925) in the [[Massey Memorial]] in [[Wellington]], and [[Michael Joseph Savage]] (died 1940) in the Savage Memorial at [[Bastion Point]] in [[Auckland]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Savage Memorial|url=https://mch.govt.nz/nz-identity-heritage/national-monuments-war-graves/savage-memorial|publisher=Ministry for Culture and Heritage|accessdate=15 May 2018}}</ref>

==Protection==
The [[Diplomatic Protection Service]] is a special branch of the New Zealand Police that is charged with protecting the prime minister (and their family) and other senior government officials, as well as diplomats.<ref>{{cite web |title=Diplomatic Protection Service |url=https://www.police.govt.nz/about-us/structure/police-teams-and-units/diplomatic-protection-service |publisher=[[New Zealand Police]] |accessdate=1 January 2020 |language=en}}</ref>

==History==
[[File:Henry Sewell, ca 1872.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Henry Sewell]], regarded as New Zealand's first premier]]

Assuming that [[Henry Sewell]] is counted as the first prime minister, [[List of Prime Ministers of New Zealand|40 individuals]] have held the office since it was established. Some of these people have held it on several occasions, with the record for maximum number of times being shared between [[William Fox (politician)|William Fox]] and [[Harry Atkinson]] (both of whom served four times). The longest that anyone has served in the office is 13 years, a record set by [[Richard Seddon]]. The first holder of the office, Henry Sewell, led the country for the shortest total time; his only term lasted just 13 days. The shortest term belonged to Harry Atkinson, whose third term lasted only seven days, but Atkinson served longer in total than did Sewell.<ref name="trivia">{{cite web|title=Prime ministerial trivia|url=https://nzhistory.govt.nz/politics/premiers-and-pms/trivia|publisher=Ministry for Culture and Heritage|accessdate=15 May 2018}}</ref> The youngest was [[Edward Stafford (politician)|Edward Stafford]], who was appointed premier in 1856, at 37 years, 40 days old.<ref name="Coulter">{{cite web|last1=Coulter|first1=Martin|title=New Zealand gets its third female Prime Minister, aged 37|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/world/new-zealand-gets-its-third-female-prime-minister-and-jacinda-ardern-is-just-37-a3662496.html|work=Evening Standard|accessdate=15 May 2018|date=19 October 2017}}</ref> The oldest was [[Walter Nash]], who was 78 years old when he left office in 1960 (and 75 upon taking office in 1957).<ref name="trivia"/>

===Early leaders===
On becoming the [[Colony of New Zealand]] in 1841, New Zealand was directly governed by a [[Governor-General of New Zealand|governor]], appointed by the [[Colonial Office]] in Britain. [[Self-government]] was established in 1853, following the [[New Zealand Constitution Act 1852]], and the [[1st New Zealand Parliament|First Parliament]] met on 24 May 1854.<ref>{{cite web|title=The House of Representatives – First sitting, 1854|url=https://nzhistory.govt.nz/politics/history-of-parliament/first-sitting-1854|publisher=Ministry for Culture and Heritage|accessdate=15 May 2018|date=19 August 2015}}</ref>

The origins of the office of prime minister are disputed. Use of the words "[[prime minister]]" as a descriptive term date back to the First Parliament, where they are applied to [[James FitzGerald (New Zealand politician)|James FitzGerald]] and [[Thomas Forsaith]].<ref name="McLean">{{cite book|last1=McLean|first1=Gavin|title=The Governors: New Zealand's Governors and Governors-General|date=2006|publisher=Otago University Press|page=354|isbn=9781877372254|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-IOOAAAAMAAJ|language=en}}</ref> FitzGerald and Forsaith had no official titles, however, and New Zealand had not yet obtained self-government. As such, they are not usually considered prime ministers in any substantive sense.<ref name="McLintock1966">{{cite web|last1=McLintock|first1=Alexander Hare|last2=Foster|first2=Bernard John|last3=Taonga|title=The First Premier|url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/1966/prime-ministers-of-new-zealand|website=[[An Encyclopaedia of New Zealand]]|publisher=New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage|accessdate=15 May 2018|language=en|date=1966}}</ref>

The first person to be formally appointed to a position of executive leadership was [[Henry Sewell]],<ref name="McLintock1966"/> who formed a brief [[Ministry (collective executive)|ministry]] in April 1856, at the beginning of the [[2nd New Zealand Parliament|Second Parliament]]. Despite his formal leadership role, however, his only actual title was "[[Colonial Secretary of New Zealand|colonial secretary]]",<ref name="McLean"/> a position comparable to a [[Minister of Internal Affairs (New Zealand)|minister of internal affairs]]. His successor, [[William Fox (politician)|William Fox]], was also given a formal leadership role, but was not colonial secretary. When [[Frederick Weld]] became the sixth person appointed to formal leadership, a substantive leadership title, "premier", appeared. Weld's successor, [[Edward Stafford (politician)|Edward Stafford]], briefly changed the title to "first minister", but it was soon restored to premier during the second tenure of Fox.<ref name="title">{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/1966/prime-ministers-of-new-zealand/page-2|last1=McLintock|first1=Alexander Hare|title=Prime Minister: The Title 'Premier'|encyclopedia=[[An Encyclopaedia of New Zealand]]|date=1966|accessdate=5 January 2015}}</ref> From that point, the term "premier" was used almost exclusively for the remainder of the 19th century. Nevertheless, in the Schedule of the [[Civil List]] of 1873, provision was made for the salary of the head of government, referred to as the "Prime Minister".<ref name="title"/>

Initially, premiers acted as mere advisers to the governor—with the governor at times a very active partner. This began to change during the first tenure of Edward Stafford. Stafford met with his ministers and made decisions outside of the Executive Council, thus establishing the modern convention of [[cabinet government]].<ref>{{Cite book |first=Edward |last=Bohan |title=Edward Stafford, New Zealand's first statesman|place = [[Christchurch]], New Zealand |publisher=Hazard Press |year=1994 |isbn=0-908790-67-8 }}</ref> Stafford also clashed with the governor over control of [[Māori people|native]] affairs, which was eventually to fall within the premier's powers.<ref name="governors">{{citation|first=Gavin|last=McLean|title=The Governors, New Zealand Governors and Governors-General|publisher=Otago University Press|url=http://www.otago.ac.nz/press/booksauthors/2006/governors.html|isbn= 978-1-877372-25-4|date=October 2006}}</ref>

===Party leadership===
[[File:RichardSeddon1905.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Richard Seddon]] styled himself "Prime Minister" in 1901]]
The political position of the premier was enhanced by the development of modern [[List of political parties in New Zealand|political parties]]; premier [[John Ballance]] organised the first formal party in New Zealand, forming the [[Liberal Government of New Zealand|Liberal Government]] in 1891.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/1966/political-parties/page-9|last1=McLintock|first1=Alexander Hare|title=The Rise of the Liberal Party|encyclopedia=[[An Encyclopaedia of New Zealand]]|date=1966|accessdate=5 January 2015}}</ref> (Subsequent governments were led by prime ministers from the [[Reform Party (New Zealand)|Reform]], [[United Party (New Zealand)|United]], [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour]] and [[New Zealand National|National]] parties). Although not every government would have a large majority, the [[party system]] and tight control of party members by [[whip (politics)|whips]] helped heads of government to direct the passage of legislation in the House of Representatives. In 1893, the premier gained the ability to restrict the term of appointments to the [[New Zealand Legislative Council|Legislative Council]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Parliamentary Debates, Volume 289|date=1950|publisher=New Zealand Parliament|page=642|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tooLAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA642|language=en}}</ref>

The title of "prime minister" was used by [[Richard Seddon]] after 1901,<ref name="title"/> following New Zealand's self-exclusion from the [[Federation of Australia]]. Seddon's immediate successor, [[William Hall-Jones]], was the first to be sworn-in as "prime minister", in 1906.<ref>{{cite web |title=Hall-Jones, William |url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/biographies/2h7/hall-jones-william |publisher=[[Dictionary of New Zealand Biography]] |accessdate=27 June 2018 |date=1993}}</ref>

The expanding power of the prime minister was kept in check by the need to build consensus with other leading members of Cabinet and of the governing party, including those who represented various ideological wings of the party. Other institutions, including Parliament itself and the wider state bureaucracy, also acted as limits on prime ministerial power; in 1912 [[Thomas Mackenzie]] was the last prime minister to lose power through an unsuccessful [[motion of no confidence|confidence motion]] in the House of Representatives.<ref name="trivia"/>

===Towards modern leadership===
One change brought about by the [[First World War]] was direct participation in governing the British Empire. Previously, New Zealand prime ministers had attended occasional colonial and imperial conferences, but they otherwise communicated with London through the governor (a position then appointed by the British government). In 1917, however, British prime minister [[David Lloyd George]] offered the New Zealand prime minister a seat in the [[Imperial War Cabinet]], the British Empire's wartime coordinating body. In 1919, [[Bill Massey]] signed the [[Treaty of Versailles]] on behalf of New Zealand, signalling both prestige within the empire as well as a new independence for the country.<ref name="party leadership">{{cite encyclopedia |title=Party leadership |url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/premiers-and-prime-ministers/page-3 |encyclopedia=Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand|accessdate=13 June 2018|date=1 December 2016}}</ref>

Constitutional conventions adopted in 1930, following the [[1930 Imperial Conference|Imperial Conference]] held that year, increased the domestic and international prestige of the prime minister. The [[Statute of Westminster 1931]] confirmed that Dominions had exclusive power to make their laws. New Zealand initially resisted greater autonomy and did not [[Statute of Westminster Adoption Act 1947|adopt the statute until 1947]]. Increasingly, however, New Zealand began to act independently in foreign affairs. During the 1940s the prime minister's profile rose as New Zealand signed a number of international treaties.<ref name="party leadership"/> In 1967, [[Keith Holyoake]] became the first New Zealand prime minister to select candidates for the position of governor-general without any involvement of the British government. Holyoake advised the monarch, [[Queen Elizabeth II]], to appoint [[Arthur Porritt, Baron Porritt|Sir Arthur Porritt]], the first New Zealand-born governor-general.<ref name="governors" />

After the [[mixed-member proportional]] (MMP) system was [[electoral reform in New Zealand|introduced in 1996]], prime ministers have had to manage minority governments. The skill of MMP management was exemplified by [[Helen Clark]]'s nine years as prime minister (1999–2008), when her Labour government remained in power thanks to a range of [[confidence-and-supply]] agreements with five smaller parties.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|last1=McLean|first1=Gavin|title=Premiers and prime ministers - Towards modern leadership|url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/premiers-and-prime-ministers/page-4|encyclopedia=Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand|accessdate=16 May 2018|date=1 December 2016}}</ref>

Until the premiership of Helen Clark, it was customary for senior members of the legislature, executive and judiciary—including the prime minister—to be appointed to the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|British Privy Council]], granting them the style "Right Honourable". This practice was discontinued at the same time as the abolition of knighthoods and damehoods in 2000 from the [[Orders, decorations, and medals of New Zealand|New Zealand honours system]]. National's [[John Key]] became prime minister in 2008 and moved to restore titular honours,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/honoured-new-zealanders/news/article.cfm?c_id=513&objectid=10560600|title=Titles of Dames, Knights to be restored – Key|work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|date=8 March 2009}}</ref> but did not resume appointments to the Privy Council, meaning Key was styled "The Honourable". However, on 3 August 2010 the Queen granted the prime minister, along with the governor-general, [[Speaker of the New Zealand House of Representatives|speaker of the House of Representatives]] and [[Chief Justice of New Zealand|chief justice]], the style "Right Honourable" upon appointment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PA1008/S00014/new-rules-for-use-of-the-right-honourable.htm|title=New rules for use of the Right Honourable|publisher=The Royal Household |via=[[Scoop.co.nz]]|date=3 August 2010}}</ref>

On 21 June 2018, Labour's [[Jacinda Ardern]] became the first prime minister of New Zealand (and second elected head of government in the world) to give birth while in office.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-44568537|title=Ardern and Bhutto: Two different pregnancies in power|last=Khan|first=M Ilyas|date=21 June 2018|work=BBC News|access-date=22 June 2018|quote=Now that New Zealand's Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has hit world headlines by becoming only the second elected head of government to give birth in office, attention has naturally been drawn to the first such leader – Pakistan's late two-time Prime Minister [[Benazir Bhutto]].}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=It's a girl!

== Deputy Prime Minister ==
{{Main|Deputy Prime Minister of New Zealand}}
A position officially titled deputy prime minister has existed since 1954. The deputy typically holds important ministerial portfolios and, by convention, becomes [[acting prime minister]] in the absence or incapacity of the prime minister. The deputy is commonly a member of the same party as the prime minister, but not necessarily so; in coalition governments the parliamentary leader of a junior party may be offered the post.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Small|first1=Vernon|title=Labour leader looks to outsiders for deputy|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/8052977/Labour-leader-looks-to-outsiders-for-deputy|accessdate=14 May 2018|work=Stuff.co.nz|date=8 December 2012|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Mulgan |first1=R.
