A '''diplomat''' (from {{lang-grc|δίπλωμα}}; [[romanization|romanized]] diploma) is a person appointed by a [[state (polity)|state]] or an intergovernmental institution such as the [[United Nations]] or the [[European Union]] to conduct [[diplomacy]] with one or more other States or [[international organization]]s.

The main functions of diplomats are: representation and protection of the interests and nationals of the sending State; initiation and facilitation of strategic agreements; treaties and conventions; promotion of information; trade and commerce; technology; and friendly relations. Seasoned diplomats of international repute are used in international organizations (for example, the [[United Nations]], the world's largest diplomatic forum) as well as multinational companies for their experience in management and [[Negotiation|negotiating]] skills. Diplomats are members of foreign services and diplomatic corps of various nations of the world. The sending state is required to get the consent of the receiving state for a person proposed to serve in key diplomatic positions such as an ambassador, also referred to as the head of the mission. The receiving state of the proposed diplomat may accept the diplomat or refuse to accept the diplomat without having to provide reasons for its refusal or acceptance of the person. While the head of the mission or any member of the diplomatic staff is already on duty in the receiving state, the receiving may still decide at anytime that the person is no longer wanted in the state and is considered personal non grata, when this happens the sending state may discharge the person.<ref>{{Cite web|title=United Nations Treaty Collection|url=https://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=IND&mtdsg_no=III-3&chapter=3&clang=_en|access-date=2020-11-12|website=treaties.un.org|language=EN}}</ref>

Diplomats are the oldest form of any of the [[foreign policy]] institutions of a state, predating by centuries [[foreign minister]]s and ministerial offices. They usually have [[diplomatic immunity]], and in their official travels they usually use a [[diplomatic passport]] or, for UN officials, a [[United Nations laissez-passer]].

==Terminology==

The regular use of permanent diplomatic representation began between the States of fifteenth century Italy. However the terms "diplomacy" and "diplomat" appeared in the French Revolution. "Diplomat" is derived from the Greek διπλωμάτης (''diplōmátēs''), the holder of a [[diploma]], referring to diplomats' documents of [[Diplomatic accreditation|accreditation]] from their sovereign.<ref>{{cite book|author=S. Anderson, Matthew|title=The Rise of Modern Diplomacy, 1450–1919|date=1993|page=6}}</ref>

Diplomats themselves and historians often refer to the foreign ministry by its address: the Ballhausplatz (Vienna), the Quai d’Orsay (Paris), the Wilhelmstraße (Berlin); [[Itamaraty Palace|Itamaraty]] (from the former Itamaraty Palace in Rio de Janeiro, now transferred to Brasília since 1970) and Foggy Bottom (Washington). For imperial Russia to 1917 it was the Choristers' Bridge (St Petersburg). The Italian ministry was called "the Consulta."<ref>David Stevenson, "The Diplomats" in Jay Winter, ed. ''The Cambridge History of the First World War: Volume II: The State'' (2014) vol 2 p 68.</ref>

== Career diplomats and political appointees ==
Though any person can be appointed by the State's national government to conduct said state's relations with other States or international organizations, a number of States maintain an institutionalized group of career diplomats—that is, public servants with a steady professional connection to the country's [[Foreign minister|foreign ministry]]. The term ''career diplomat'' is used worldwide<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.independentdiplomat.org/about-us/our-staff/paul-whiteway |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-01-21 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150121044208/http://www.independentdiplomat.org/about-us/our-staff/paul-whiteway |archivedate=2015-01-21 }}</ref><ref name="xinhuanet.com">{{cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/europe/europe/2014-11/25/c_133811052.htm|title=Career diplomat Aurescu becomes Romanian new FM|work=xinhuanet.com|accessdate=18 November 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160822120941/http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/europe/europe/2014-11/25/c_133811052.htm|archive-date=22 August 2016|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/02/world/europe/john-f-tefft-a-career-diplomat-will-go-to-russia.html|title=John F.

[[Figurehead|Ceremonial heads of state]] commonly act as diplomats on behalf of their nation, usually following instructions from their head of Government.

==Diplomatic ranks==
{{main|Diplomatic rank}}

Whether being a career diplomat or a political appointee, every diplomat, while posted abroad, will be classified in one of the ranks of diplomats (secretary, counselor, minister, [[ambassador]], [[Diplomacy|envoy]], or ''[[chargé d'affaires]]'') as regulated by international law (namely, by the [[Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations]] of 1961).

Diplomats can be contrasted with [[Consul (representative)|consuls]] and [[attaché]]s, who represent their State in a number of administrative ways, but who don't have the diplomat's political functions, or with international officers of the [[United Nations]].

== Function ==
Diplomats in posts collect and report information that could affect national interests, often with advice about how the home-country government should respond. Then, once any policy response has been decided in the home country's capital, posts bear major responsibility for implementing it. Diplomats have the job of conveying, in the most persuasive way possible, the views of the home government to the governments to which they are accredited and, in doing so, of trying to convince those governments to act in ways that suit home-country interests. In this way, diplomats are part of the beginning and the end of each loop in the continuous process through which [[foreign policy]] develops.

In general, it has become harder for diplomats to act autonomously. Diplomats have to seize secure communication systems, emails, and mobile telephones can be tracked down and instruct the most reclusive head of mission. The same technology in reverse gives diplomats the capacity for more immediate input about the policy-making processes in the home capital.

[[Email encryption|Secure email]] has transformed the contact between diplomats and the ministry. It is less likely to leak, and enables more personal contact than the formal [[Telegraphy|cablegram]], with its wide distribution and impersonal style.

=== Advocacy ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2015}}
The home country will usually send instructions to a diplomatic post on what foreign policy goals to pursue, but decisions on tactics – who needs to be influenced, what will best persuade them, who are potential allies and adversaries, and how it can be done - are for the diplomats overseas to make.

In this operation, the intelligence, integrity, cultural understanding, and energy of individual diplomats become critical. If competent, they will have developed relationships grounded in trust and mutual understanding with influential members of the country in which they are accredited. They will have worked hard to understand the motives, thought patterns and [[culture]] of the other side.

=== Negotiation ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2015}}
The diplomat should be an excellent negotiator but, above all, a catalyst for peace and understanding between people. The diplomat's principal role is to foster peaceful relations between states. This role takes on heightened importance if war breaks out. Negotiation must necessarily continue – but within significantly altered contexts.

== Training ==
Most career diplomats have [[university]] [[academic degree|degrees]] in [[international relations]], [[political science]], [[history]], [[economics]], or [[law]].<ref>Stuart Seldowitz, "The Psychology of Diplomatic Conflict Resolution", in H. J. Langholtz and C. E.Stout, Eds. ''The Psychology of Diplomacy'' (Westport: Praeger, 2004), pp. 47–58.</ref> "Emotional intelligence" has recently become a component of many foreign service training programs.<ref>PT210 Advanced Leadership Skills, Foreign Service Institute Training, at fsitraining.state.gov/Catalog/CourseDetails/PT210</ref>

== Status and public image ==
Diplomats have generally been considered members of an exclusive and prestigious profession. The public image of diplomats has been described as "a caricature of pinstriped men gliding their way around a never-ending global cocktail party".<ref>Allan Gyngell and Michael Wesley, ''Making Australian Foreign Policy'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2003), pp. 106.</ref> J. W. Burton has noted that "despite the absence of any specific professional training, diplomacy has a high professional status, due perhaps to a degree of secrecy and mystery that its practitioners self-consciously promote."<ref>J. W. Burton, ''Systems, States, Diplomacy and Rules'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1968), p. 206.</ref> The state supports the high status, privileges, and [[self-esteem]] of its diplomats in order to support its own international status and position.

The high regard for diplomats is also due to most countries' conspicuous selection of diplomats, with regard to their professionalism and ability to behave according to a certain [[etiquette]], in order to effectively promote their interests. Also, [[international law]] grants diplomats extensive privileges and [[diplomatic immunity|immunities]], which further distinguishes the diplomat from the status of an ordinary [[citizen]].

== Psychology and loyalty ==
{{Further|Clientitis}}

While posted overseas, there is a danger that diplomats may become disconnected from their own country and culture. Sir [[Harold Nicolson]] acknowledged that diplomats can become "denationalised, internationalised and therefore dehydrated, an elegant empty husk".<ref>Harold Nicolson, ''The Evolution of Diplomacy'' (New York: Collier, 1962) at 107.</ref> Nicolson also claimed that personal motives often influenced the diplomatic pursuit of the national interest. For example, he wrote: "Nobody who has not actually watched statesmen dealing with each other can have any real idea of the immense part played in human affairs by such unavowable and often unrecognisable causes as lassitude, affability, personal affection or dislike, misunderstanding, deafness or incomplete command of a foreign language, vanity, social engagements, interruptions and momentary health."<ref>Harold Nicolson, ''The Congress of Vienna: A Study in Allied Unity, 1812-1822'' (New York: Harcourt, Brace and Co., 1946), 19.</ref>

To prevent disconnection and apathy from their own state, many foreign services mandate their employees to return to their home countries in between period serving abroad.

==International Day of Diplomats==
Diplomats have started celebrating [[International Day of Diplomats]] on October 24 since 2017.<ref>[https://www.business-standard.com/article/news-ani/first-international-day-of-diplomats-celebrated-in-brasilia-117102500158_1.html First International Day of Diplomats celebrated in Brasilia ] Business Standard, October 25, 2017</ref> The idea of celebrating International Day of Diplomats on the day the [[United Nations]] was founded was proposed by Indian diplomat [[Abhay Kumar]] to mark the occasion as diplomacy becoming the principal means of resolving disputes.<ref>[https://www.dailyo.in/voices/ifs-indian-foreign-service-diplomats-diplomacy-united-nations/story/1/20024.html Why the world needs International Day of Diplomats, our everyday peacekeepers] Daily O, 12 October 2017</ref>
