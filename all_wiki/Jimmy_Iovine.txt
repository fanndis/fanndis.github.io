By 1973, Iovine was on staff at the New York studio the [[Record Plant]],<ref>{{cite web|title=The Record Plant|url=http://www.recordplant.com/rphistory1.html|publisher=The Record Plant|access-date=13 March 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120817020147/http://www.recordplant.com/rphistory1.html|archive-date=17 August 2012}}</ref> where he worked on Springsteen's ''[[Born to Run]]'' and Meat Loaf's ''[[Bat Out of Hell]]'' albums. He came to prominence via his work on the 1978 [[Patti Smith]] album ''[[Easter (Patti Smith Group album)|Easter]]'', which included her [[Top 40]] hit "[[Because the Night]]". He teamed with [[Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers]] on ''[[Damn the Torpedoes (album)|Damn the Torpedoes]]'' and [[U2]] on ''[[Rattle and Hum]]''. Iovine also produced ''[[Bella Donna (album)|Bella Donna]]'' (the first solo album for [[Stevie Nicks]]), ''[[Making Movies]]'' for [[Dire Straits]], and ''[[Get Close]]'' for [[The Pretenders]].

Iovine served as sound engineer for the [[Voyager Golden Record]]s, a pair of phonograph records which were launched aboard the [[Voyager program|Voyager space probes]] in 1977.<ref name="Ferris">{{cite news|last1=Ferris|first1=Timothy|title=How the Voyager Golden Record Was Made|url=https://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/voyager-golden-record-40th-anniversary-timothy-ferris|access-date=15 November 2017|publisher=The New Yorker|date=20 August 2017}}</ref>

Iovine was also responsible for supervising the music used in the 1984 romance film ''[[Sixteen Candles]]'' and the 1988 comedy film ''[[Scrooged]]''.

In 1990, Iovine co-founded Interscope Records, which became [[Interscope Geffen A&M]] after a merger in 1999.<ref>{{cite web|title=Corporate Profile: Interscope Geffen A&M|url=http://profileengine.com/groups/profile/433108559/interscope-geffen-am-records|publisher=Profile Engine|access-date=13 March 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171114124912/http://profileengine.com/groups/profile/433108559/interscope-geffen-am-records|archive-date=14 November 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>
 
Iovine signed [[Tupac Shakur]] to a recording contract as one of the first hip-hop acts on the Interscope label in 1991.

Iovine was also responsible for providing distribution, initial funding and financial oversight for the highly successful [[Death Row Records]] hip-hop label in the 1990s.

In 2002, Iovine co-produced the [[Academy Award for Best Original Song#2000s|Academy Award]]-winning Eminem movie, ''[[8 Mile (film)|8 Mile]]'', which opened at #1 at the box office and went on to gross more than $240 million worldwide.<ref>{{cite web|title=8 Mile Box Office|url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=8mile.htm|publisher=Box Office Mojo|access-date=13 March 2013}}</ref> Additionally, Iovine executive produced the 2009 [[LeBron James]] documentary ''[[More than a Game]]''<ref>{{cite web|last=Turan|first=Kenneth|title=More Than A Game|url=https://articles.latimes.com/2009/oct/02/entertainment/et-game2|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=13 March 2013|date=2009-10-02}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Jimmy Iovine at IMDb|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0409666/|publisher=IMDb|access-date=13 March 2013}}</ref> and 50 Cent's ''[[Get Rich or Die Tryin' (film)|Get Rich or Die Tryin']]''.<ref>{{cite web|last=Goldstein|first=Patrick|title=Has He Got Next?|url=https://articles.latimes.com/2005/nov/08/entertainment/et-goldstein8/2|date=November 8, 2005|access-date=15 March 2013}}</ref>

==Personal life==
Relationships:
* While producing her album ''[[Bella Donna (album)|Bella Donna]]'', Iovine entered into a relationship with singer [[Stevie Nicks]]. The two split in 1982. Nicks wrote the song "Straight Back", included in the [[Fleetwood Mac]] album ''[[Mirage (Fleetwood Mac album)|Mirage]]'', about him{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}.  According to Nicks, Iovine was an inspiration for one of her signature songs, "[[Edge of Seventeen]]".  According to Nicks, Iovine's despondence from the death of his good friend [[John Lennon]] overwhelmed Nicks, and eventually led to the end of their relationship.  However, the strong emotion of the time led to the creation of "Edge of Seventeen."  <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.inherownwords.com/edge.htm|title=Stevie Nicks on Edge of 17|website=Inherownwords.com}}</ref>
