==History==
[[Image:The Icebergs (Frederic Edwin Church), 1861 (color).jpg|thumb|left|300px|[[Frederic Edwin Church]], ''[[The Icebergs]]'', 1861]]
The museum's history began with the establishment in 1903 of the Dallas Art Association, which initially exhibited paintings in the [[Dallas Public Library]]. [[Frank Reaugh]], a Texas artist, saw in the new library the opportunity to display works of art.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dm-art.org/AboutUs/MuseumHistory/index.htm |title=Museum History |accessdate=3 July 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120301142158/http://www.dm-art.org/AboutUs/MuseumHistory/index.htm |archive-date=1 March 2012 }}</ref> This idea was championed by [[May Dickson Exall]], who was the first president of the Dallas Public Library. Her intention was the following: “to offer art interest and education through exhibitions and lectures, to form a permanent collection, to sponsor the work of local artists, to solicit support of the arts from individuals and businesses, and to honor citizens who support the arts.”

The museum's collections started growing from this moment on. It soon became necessary to find a new permanent home. The museum, renamed the Dallas Museum of Fine Arts in 1932, relocated to a new art deco facility within [[Fair Park]] in 1936, on the occasion of the [[Texas Centennial Exposition]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.texascentennial.com/|title=Default Parallels Plesk Page|accessdate=3 July 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150704173332/http://www.texascentennial.com/|archive-date=4 July 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref>  This new facility was designed by a consortium of Dallas architects in consultation with [[Paul Cret]] of Philadelphia. It is still possible to visit this building.

In 1943, [[Jerry Bywaters]] became the director of the museum, a position he held for the next twenty-one years.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fby14|title=Bywaters, Williamson Gerald (Jerry)|accessdate=3 July 2015|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150922043056/https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fby14|archive-date=22 September 2015}}</ref> Artist, art critic, and teacher, Bywaters gave a sense of identity and community to the museum.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://smu.edu/meadowsmuseum/about_Bywaters.htm|title=Meadows Museum at Southern Methodist University, Dallas, Texas: Exhibitions<!-- Bot generated title -->|accessdate=3 July 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121107081350/http://smu.edu/meadowsmuseum/about_Bywaters.htm|archive-date=7 November 2012}}</ref> [[File:Fox In The Snow - Courbet (1860).JPG|thumb|right|300px|[[Gustave Courbet]], ''Fox in the Snow'', 1860]]Under Bywaters' tenure, impressionist, abstract, and contemporary masterpieces were acquired and the [[Texas]] identity of the museum was emphasized. This identity is today represented by works by [[Alexandre Hogue]], Olin Herman Travis, Bywaters himself, and others.

In 1963, the Dallas Museum of Fine Arts merged with the Dallas Museum of Contemporary Art,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://dallasmuseumofart.org/idc/groups/public/documents/web_content/dma_295634.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-11-02 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101027175106/http://dallasmuseumofart.org/idc/groups/public/documents/web_content/dma_295634.pdf |archive-date=2010-10-27 }}</ref> whose director for the previous four years had been Douglas MacAgy. In 1964 Merrill C. Rueppel became the director of the newly merged Museum. The permanent collections of the two museums were then housed within the DMFA facility, suddenly holding significant works by [[Paul Gauguin]], [[Odilon Redon]], [[Henri Matisse]], [[Piet Mondrian]], [[Gerald Murphy]], and [[Francis Bacon (artist)|Francis Bacon]]. In 1965, the museum held an exhibition called ''The Art of Piet Mondrian'' and one entitled ''Sculpture: Twentieth Century''.<ref name=autogenerated1 />

By the late 1970s, the greatly enlarged permanent collection and the ambitious exhibition program fostered a need for a new museum facility. Under Harry Parker's direction, the museum was able to move once again, to its current venue, at the northern edge of the city's business district (the now designated Dallas Arts District). The $54 million facility, designed by New York architect [[Edward Larrabee Barnes]], was financed by a 1979 City bond election, together with private donations. The project was galvanized by the slogan “A Great City Deserves a Great Museum,” and the new building opened in January 1984.<ref>[http://www.dm-art.org/PressRoom/dma_262208 Dallas Museum of Art<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100428035238/http://www.dm-art.org/PressRoom/dma_262208 |date=2010-04-28 }}</ref>

==Collections==
The museum's collections<ref>’’Dallas Museum of Art, A Guide to the Collection’’ Managing Editor: Debra Wittrup (1997)</ref> include more than 24,000 works of art from around the world ranging from ancient to modern times. They are conceived as a celebration of the human power of creation.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.dma.org/collection |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-12-14 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160120213026/https://www.dma.org/collection |archive-date=2016-01-20 }}</ref>

===African===
Objects in the museum's '''[[African art|African collection]]''' come from [[West Africa]] and [[Central Africa]]. The objects date primarily from the 16th to the 20th centuries, although the earliest object is a Nok terracotta bust from Nigeria that dates from somewhere between 200 BC to 200 AD. Some works in the collection were created as [[symbols of leadership]] and status, while others express concepts related to the cycle of life.  Highlights of the collection include a [[Benin]] plaque of copper alloy over wood depicting a warrior chief, a carved wood Senufo rhythm pounder from southeastern [[Mali]], and a [[Kingdom of Kongo|Congo]] standing power figure studded with ritually embedded iron nails or blades.

===American===
The '''[[Visual art of the United States|American art]]''' collection includes paintings, sculptures, and works on paper from the United States from the [[Colonial history of the United States|colonial period]] to [[World War II]], and art from Mexico, and Canada. Among the highlights of the collection are ''Duck Island'' (1906) by [[Childe Hassam]], ''Lighthouse Hill'' (1927) by [[Edward Hopper]], ''That Gentleman'' (1960) by [[Andrew Wyeth]], ''Bare Tree Trunks with Snow'' (1946) by [[Georgia O'Keeffe]] and ''Razor'' and ''Watch'' by [[Gerald Murphy]] (1924, 1925). One of the most important pieces in the collection is ''The Icebergs'' (1861) by [[Frederic Edwin Church]]. This painting had long been referred to as a lost masterpiece. The painting was given to the museum in 1979 by Norma and [[Lamar Hunt]]. The Dallas Museum of Art also has one of the most thorough collections of Texas art. This is in great part thanks to Jerry Bywaters, director of the DMA from to 1943 to 1964, who was also one of the Dallas Nine, an influential group of Texas artists. In addition to paintings by Bywaters, the DMA has works by [[Robert Jenkins Onderdonk]], [[Julian Onderdonk]], [[Alexandre Hogue]], [[Clara McDonald Williamson]], [[David Bates (American artist)|David Bates]], Dorothy Austin, Michael Owen, and Olin Herman Travis.

===Ancient Mediterranean===
The Dallas Museum of Art collection of '''Ancient Mediterranean art''' includes Cycladic, Egyptian, Greek, Roman, Etruscan, and Apulian objects. Highlights of [[Egyptian art]] is a painted limestone ''Relief of a Procession of Offering Bearers from the Tomb of Ny-Ank-Nesut'' from 2575-2134 BC. The more extensive Greek collection includes a marble ''Figure of a man from a funerary relief'' from 300 BC, bronze sculptures, decorative objects, and gold jewelry. The art of [[ancient Rome]] is represented by a ''Figure of a woman'' from the 2nd century AD and a marble sarcophagus carved in high relief with a battle scene, c. 190 AD.

===Asian===
The museum's collections of '''South [[Asian art]]''' range from Gandharan [[Buddhist art]] of the 2nd to 4th centuries AD to the arts of the [[Mughal Empire]] in India from the 15th to the 19th century. Highlights include a 12th-century bronze Shiva Nataraja and a 10th-century sandstone representation of the god [[Vishnu]] as the boar-headed Varaha. The arts of [[Tibet]], [[Nepal]], and [[Thailand]] are also represented.

===Contemporary===
Many important artistic trends since 1945 are represented in the museum's vast collection of [[contemporary art]],<ref>''Fast Forward: Exhibition Catalogue. Contemporary Collections for the Dallas Museum of Art'', Edited by Maria de Corral and John R. Lane, 2007</ref> from [[abstract expressionism]] to pop and [[op Art]], and from [[minimalism]], and [[conceptualism]] to [[installation art]], [[assemblage (art)|assemblage]], and [[video art]]. Contemporary artists within the collection whose reputations are well established include [[Jackson Pollock]], [[Mark Rothko]], [[Franz Kline]], [[Jasper Johns]], [[Robert Rauschenberg]], [[Bruce Nauman]], and [[Robert Smithson]]. Among photographers represented in the collection are [[Cindy Sherman]], [[Nic Nicosia]], [[Thomas Struth]], and [[Lynn Davis (photographer)|Lynn Davis]]. When the current Museum facility opened in the mid-1980s, several artists were commissioned to create site-specific works especially for the Dallas Museum of Art: [[Ellsworth Kelly]], [[Sol LeWitt]], [[Richard Fleischner]], and [[Claes Oldenburg]] with [[Coosje van Bruggen]]. In recent years, the museum has shown a strong interest in collecting the work of contemporary German artists such as [[Gerhard Richter]], [[Sigmar Polke]], and [[Anselm Kiefer]].

===Decorative Arts And Design===
The expansive collections of '''Decorative Arts and Design''' feature over 8,000 works mostly from Europe and America in various media including furniture, ceramics, glass, textiles, and metalware. Among the earliest works in the collection are 16th-century Spanish textiles, 17th century [[Chinese export porcelain]], and European metalware, including the Hoblitzelle Collection of English and Irish [[silver]]. Two exceptional early silver objects are a cup and cover (1742) by silversmith [[Paul de Lamerie]] and a massive wine cistern (1761–62) by [[Abraham Portal]] for [[Francis Hastings, 10th Earl of Huntingdon|Francis Hastings]], the 10th Earl of Huntingdon.  American 18th-century furniture forms the core of the Faith P. and Charles L. Bybee Collection, featuring seating and case pieces from Boston, Connecticut, New York, Philadelphia and other regions. The internationally renowned 19th- and 20th-century American silver collection is among the very finest of its type, with major examples by the leading firms of the last two centuries including [[Tiffany & Co.]], [[Gorham Manufacturing Company]], [[Reed & Barton]], and International Silver Co. In addition to a unique solid silver dressing table (1899) made by Gorham for the [[Exposition Universelle (1900)|Paris Exposition]] Universelle of 1900 other highlights include a [[Gothic revival]] bed (c.1844) made for [[Henry Clay]], a [[Herter Brothers]] [[sideboard]] (c. 1881-82) for [[William Henry Vanderbilt]], a pair of [[Louis Comfort Tiffany]] stained glass windows (c.1885-95) depicting an undersea scene and a collection of [[Arts and Crafts movement]] and early modern designs by [[Gustav Stickley]], [[Charles Rohlfs]], [[Christopher Dresser]], [[Louis Majorelle]], [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] and others. The contemporary design holdings include exceptional works by [[Ettore Sottsass]], [[Zaha Hadid]], [[Richard Meier]], the [[Campana brothers]], and a newly formed collection of jewelry.

===European===
The Dallas Museum of Art's collection of '''[[European art]]''' starts in the 16th century. Some of the earlier works include paintings by [[Giulio Cesare Procaccini]] (''Ecce Homo'', 1615–18), [[Pietro Paolini]] (''Bacchic Concert'', 1630), and [[Nicolas Mignard]] (''The Shepherd Faustulus Bringing Romulus and Remus to His Wife'', 1654). Art of the 18th century is represented by artists like [[Canaletto]] (''A View from the Fondamenta Nuova'', 1772), [[Jean-Baptiste Marie Pierre]] (''The Abduction of Europa'', 1750), and [[Claude-Joseph Vernet]] (''Mountain Landscape with Approaching Storm'', 1775).

The loan of the Michael L. Rosenberg collection brings an added depth to the museum's 18th-century French collection.<ref>[http://www.dm-art.org/PressRoom/Archives/dma_205781 Dallas Museum of Art<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726001950/http://www.dm-art.org/PressRoom/Archives/dma_205781 |date=2011-07-26 }}</ref> The 19th and beginning of the 20th century collection of French art also stands out. Among significant works in this collection are ''Silence'' by sculptor [[Auguste Preault]], ''Fox in the Snow'' by [[Gustave Courbet]] (1860), ''The Seine at Lavacourt'' by [[Claude Monet]] (1880), ''I Raro te Oviri'' by [[Paul Gauguin]] (1891), ''Interior'' (1902), ''Les Marroniers ou le Vitrail'' (1894) by [[Édouard Vuillard]], and ''The Harbor'' (''Le Port''), 1912, by [[Jean Metzinger]].<ref>[https://collections.dma.org/ Search the collection]</ref>

The sculpture collection from the first part of the 20th century includes important works such as ''Constructed Head n°2'' by [[Naum Gabo]], ''Three men Walking'' by [[Alberto Giacometti]], 1936, ''White Relief'' by [[Ben Nicholson]], and ''Beginning of the World'' by [[Constantin Brâncuși]] (1920). The collection of works by [[Piet Mondrian]] is noteworthy, with works like ''The Windmill'' (1908), ''Self-Portrait'' (1942), and ''Place de la Concorde'' (1938–43).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.absolutearts.com/artsnews/2001/08/20/29010.html|title=The Transatlantic Paintings: Work by Piet Mondrian - Dallas Museum of Art - Absolutearts.com|accessdate=3 July 2015|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150510074115/http://www.absolutearts.com/artsnews/2001/08/20/29010.html|archive-date=10 May 2015}}</ref>

===Wendy and Emery Reves Collection===
'''The Wendy and Emery Reves Collection.'''<ref>“The Wendy and Emery Reeves Collection”, Richard R. Bretell (1995)</ref><ref>{{cite journal |jstor=882521}}</ref> In 1985 the Dallas Museum of Art received a gift from [[Wendy Reves]] in honor of her late husband, the publisher [[Emery Reves]]. The Reves collection is housed in an elaborate 15,000-square-foot (1,400 m²) reproduction of the couple' home in France, the Villa [[La Pausa]], where the works were originally displayed [[in situ]]. La Pausa was built by the fashion designer [[Coco Chanel]] in 1927, and some of the original furniture is kept in its context. Among the 1,400 paintings, sculptures, and works on paper Emery Reves had collected are works from leading impressionist, post-impressionist, and early modernist artists, including [[Paul Cézanne]], [[Honoré Daumier]], [[Edgar Degas]], [[Paul Gauguin]], [[Édouard Manet]], [[Claude Monet]], [[Camille Pissarro]], [[Auguste Renoir]], [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]], and [[Vincent van Gogh]]. An extremely fine collection of [[Auguste Rodin]] sculptures include very fine bronze casts, rare marble like the first version of the ''Sirens'', a unique piece ''The poet and contemplative life'' from the Fenaille family, and even an unusual original wax piece. An extensive accompanying collection of decorative arts works includes Chinese export porcelain; European furniture; Oriental and European carpets; iron, bronze, and silver work; European glass; and rare books.
