"'''Green Light'''" is a song recorded by American singer [[Beyoncé]]. The song was  written by Beyoncé, [[Sean Garrett]], and [[Pharrell Williams|Pharrell]] for Beyoncé's second solo studio album, ''[[B'Day]]'' (2006). Produced by [[The Neptunes]], it was released as the fifth UK and seventh overall single on July 30, 2007 through [[Columbia Records]]. "Green Light" is an R&B-[[funk]] song with lyrics detailing a break-up song in which the female protagonist gives her [[Romantic interest|love interest]] the permission to move out. The song also finds Beyoncé using fairly aggressive tone. A remix of the song features American rapper [[Young Buck]], and was produced by [[Swizz Beatz]].

"Green Light" was well received by music critics who universally praised the beat, bass, groove, and angry tone used by Beyoncé in the song. The single performed moderately on charts, peaking at number 12 on the [[UK Singles Chart]] and at number 46 in Ireland. The [[freemasons (band)|Freemasons]] remix of the track peaked at number eighteen on the [[Dutch Top 40]] chart. The single's accompanying music video was directed by  [[Melina Matsoukas]] and co-directed by Beyoncé. It is inspired by [[Robert Palmer (singer)|Robert Palmer]]'s 1985 music video "[[Addicted to Love (song)|Addicted to Love]]". Beyoncé considered the video, which is her second to feature her all-female tour band called the Suga Mama, her toughest shoot. The song was a part of the [[set list]] on her world tour [[The Beyoncé Experience]] (2007).
