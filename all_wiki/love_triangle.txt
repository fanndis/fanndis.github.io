A '''love triangle''' (also called a '''romantic love triangle''' or a '''romance triangle''' or an '''eternal triangle''') is usually a [[Intimate relationship|romantic relationship]] involving three or more people. While it can refer to two people independently romantically linked with a third, it usually implies that each of the three people has some kind of relationship to the other two. 
The 1994 book ''Beliefs, Reasoning, and Decision Making'' states, "Although the romantic love triangle is formally identical to the friendship triad, as many have noted their actual implications are quite different....Romantic love is typically viewed as an exclusive relationship, whereas friendship is not."<ref>R. P. Abelson/R. C. Schank, ''Beliefs, Reasoning, and Decision-Making'' (1994), p. 223.</ref> Statistics suggest that, in Western society, "willingly or not, most adults have been involved in a love triangle".<ref>A. Pam/J. Pearson, ''Splitting Up'' (1998), p. 149.</ref>

==History and definitions==
[[Image:Gianciotto Discovers Paolo and Francesca Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres.jpg|thumb|250px|"[[Gianciotto Malatesta|Gianciotto]] Discovers [[Paolo Malatesta|Paolo]] and [[Francesca da Rimini|Francesca]]" by [[Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres]]; it depicts [[the Divine Comedy]].|alt=]]

The term "love triangle" generally connotes an arrangement unsuitable to one or more of the people involved.  One person typically ends up feeling betrayed at some point (e.g., "Person A is [[Jealousy|jealous]] of Person C who is having a relationship with Person B who, in Person A's eyes, is 'his/her' person.").<ref>David Cooper, ''The Death of the Family'' (Penguin 1974) p. 49</ref> A similar arrangement that is agreed upon by all parties is sometimes called a [[triad (relationship)|triad]], which is a type of ''[[polyamory]]'' even though polyamory usually implies sexual relations. Within the context of [[monogamy]], love triangles are inherently unstable, with [[unrequited love]] and jealousy as common themes. In most cases, the jealous or rejected first party ends a friendship—and sometimes even starts a fight with—the second party over the third-party love interest. Though rare, love triangles have been known to lead to [[murder]] or [[suicide]] committed by the actual or perceived rejected lover.

[[Psychoanalysis]] has explored "the theme of erotic love triangles and their roots in the [[Oedipus complex|Oedipal]] triangle".<ref name="auto">Johnson, p. 6</ref> Experience suggests that "a repeated pattern of forming or being caught in love triangle can be much dissolved by beginning to analyse the patterns of the childhood relationship to each parent in turn and to both parents as a couple".<ref name="auto"/> In such instances, "you find men who are attracted only by married woman but who can't sustain the relationship if it threatens to become more than an affair. They ''need'' the husband to protect them from a ''full'' relationship...as women who repeatedly get involved with married men need the wives".<ref>Robin Skynner/John Cleese, ''Families and How to Survive Them'' (1994) pp. 268–269</ref>

===Common themes===
{{or-section|date=May 2019}}
A common love triangle is one in which the hero or heroine is torn between two suitors of radically contrasting personalities; one of a [[girl next door]] or [[nice guy]] type, and the other as a [[physical attractiveness|physically attractive]] but potentially hazardous person.  Alternatively, the hero or heroine has a choice between a seemingly perfect lover and an imperfect but endearing person.  In this case, the "too-good-to-be-true" person is often revealed to have a significant flaw, such as hidden insensitivity or [[lechery|lecherousness]], causing the other person to become the more desirable partner.

===Eternal triangle===
{{Other uses|Eternal triangle (disambiguation)}}
"In geometric terms, the eternal triangle can be represented as comprising three points – a jealous mate (A) in a relationship with an unfaithful partner (B) who has a lover (C)...A feels ''abandoned'', B is ''between'' two mates, and C is a ''catalyst'' for crisis in the union A-B".<ref>Pam/Pearson, p. 148</ref>

It has been suggested that "a collusive network is always needed to keep the triangle eternal".<ref name="auto1">Pam/Pearson, p. 166</ref> This may take a tragic form – "I saw no prospect of its ending except with death – the death of one of three people"<ref>Rose Macaulay, ''The Towers of Trebizond'' (1990) p. 66</ref> – or alternately a comic one: "A man at the funeral of a friend's wife, with whom he has been carrying on an affair, breaks into tears and finally becomes hysterical, while the husband remains impassive. 'Calm yourself,' says the husband, 'I'll be marrying again'."<ref>G. Legman, ''Rationale of the Dirty Joke'', Vol, II (1973), p. 400.</ref>

===Homosociality===
It has been suggested that if men "share a sense of brotherhood and they allow a woman into their relationship, an [[isosceles triangle]] is created" automatically, as "in [[Truffaut]]'s film ''[[Jules et Jim]]''{{-"}}.<ref>Rebecca L. Copeland ed., ''Woman Critiqued'' (2006) p. 228</ref> [[René Girard]] has explored the role of envy and [[mimetic desire]] in such relationships, arguing that often the situation "subordinates a desired ''something'' to the ''someone'' who enjoys a privileged relationship with it".<ref>René Girard, ''A Theatre of Envy'', (Oxford 1991) p. 4.</ref> In such cases, 'it cannot be fair to blame the quarrel of the mimetic twins on a woman....She is their common scapegoat'.<ref>Girard, p. 323-4</ref>

===Marital breakup===
When a love triangle results in the breakup of a marriage, it may often be followed by what has been called "the imposition of a 'defilement taboo'...the emotional demand imposed by a jealous ex-mate...to eschew any friendly or supportive contact with the rival in the triangle".<ref>Pam/Pearson, p. 168</ref> The result is often to leave children gripped by "shadows from the past...they often take sides. Their loyalties are torn", and – except in the best of cases – "the one left 'injured' can easily sway the feelings of the children against acknowledging this new relationship".<ref>Virginia Satir, ''Peoplemaking'' (1983), pp. 181–184.</ref>

As to gender responsibility, evidence would seem to indicate that in [[late modernity]] both sexes may equally well play the part of the "Other Person" – that "men and women love with equivalent passion as well as folly"<ref name="auto1"/> and that certainly there is nothing to "suggest that a man is better able to control himself in a love triangle than a woman".<ref>Copeland, p. 47</ref> Stereotypically, the person at the center of a rivalrous love triangle is a woman, whereas for a split-object love triangle it is a man, due to the same reasons that [[polygyny]] is far more common than [[polyandry]].

Those who find themselves tempted to become the Other Man may, however, still find a cynic's advice from the 1930s pertinent on "the emotional position of the adulterer, and why to avoid it...''Did I know what a mug's game was? – No. – 'A mug's game,' he told me, 'is breaking your back at midnight, trying to make another man's wife come''{{-"}}.<ref>Legman, pp. 432–433.</ref>

==In entertainment==
Love triangles are a popular theme in entertainment, especially romantic fiction, including [[opera]], [[romance novel]]s, [[soap opera]]s, [[romantic comedy|romantic comedies]], [[manga]], [[tabloid talk shows]], and [[popular music]].

===Fiction===
[[Eric Berne]] termed that conflictual aspect of the love triangle "Let's You and Him Fight"; and considered "the psychology is essentially feminine. Because of its dramatic qualities, LYAHF is the basis of much of the world's literature, both good and bad".<ref>Eric Berne, ''Games People Play'' (Penguin), p. 108.</ref>

[[List of highest-grossing films|Three of the highest grossing movies of all time]] adjusted for inflation (''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]'', ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'' and ''[[Doctor Zhivago (film)|Doctor Zhivago]]'') are [[Romantic epic|romantic epics]] that feature a love triangle at its core. [[Young adult literature]] has seen a rise in the popularity of the love triangle story structure (such as ''[[Twilight (novel series)|Twilight]]'' or ''[[The Selection]]''). But the love triangle story structure has been around since before early classic writers like [[William Shakespeare]] and [[Alexandre Dumas]]. Shakespeare's famous play ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' featured a love triangle between Juliet, Romeo, and Paris. Although more subtle, Dumas's classics ''[[The Count of Monte Cristo]]'' and ''[[The Three Musketeers]]'' also feature love triangles strong enough to seek revenge and start a war.

Love triangles can either be relatively balanced, in which the two candidates each have a fair chance of ending up with the protagonist, or they can be lopsided, in which the hero or heroine has an obvious romantic interest in one of the candidates, and considers the other candidate as "[[platonic love|just a friend]]", but withholds a confession to avoid hurting feelings. An example of this is in the Broadway hit musical ''[[Wicked (musical)|Wicked]]'', in which dim-witted Fiyero first displays affection for [[Glinda the Good Witch]], but then falls for [[Elphaba]], the supposedly [[Wicked Witch of the West|Wicked Witch]]. But in this latter case, to provide necessary tension and drama, the second platonic candidate is also very often the hero or heroine's long-term [[boyfriend]] or [[girlfriend]].{{citation needed|date=August 2011}}

A less permanent love triangle occurs when a former lover of the main character makes an unexpected appearance to win back the character's heart, provoking feelings of jealousy from the main character's steady partner.  However, this situation is usually not considered an actual love triangle since there is little possibility of the main character breaking up with a longtime partner to pursue a just-introduced character, and it is often used as only a test of the true depth of the main character's devotion to their partner.  In these cases, the long-term partner has usually been guilty of neglect toward the main character and in the end the relationship remains intact with the long-term partner having learned some valuable lesson.

===Television===
Usually, a love triangle will end with the hero or heroine confiding their feelings in the suitor they feel is most virtuous or has the most interest in them. (As in ''[[Twilight (novel series)|Twilight]]''.) The other suitor usually steps aside to allow the couple to be happy, or comes to terms with their feelings, often claiming they could not love the main character as much.  Sometimes they are written out of the love equation entirely by falling in love with someone else, or being killed off or otherwise eliminated.  While love triangles can be accused of being [[clichéd]], if done well, they provide insight into the complexity of love and what is best to pursue in a romantic relationship.

In television shows, a love triangle is often prolonged, delaying final declarations of love between the pursued character and suitors that may prematurely end this dynamic or displease fans. Some examples of these include ''[[Dos mujeres, un camino]]'', ''[[90210 (TV series)|90210]]'', ''[[Friends]]'', ''[[The O.C.]]'', ''[[How I Met Your Mother]]'', ''[[One Tree Hill (TV series)|One Tree Hill]]'', ''[[The Vampire Diaries]]'' and ''[[Grey's Anatomy]]''. Love triangles also featured prominently on [[soap operas]], and can span more than a decade, as famously shown by [[Taylor Hamilton]], [[Ridge Forrester]] and [[Brooke Logan]] on ''[[The Bold and the Beautiful]]''. Another famous soap opera love triangle was the one that occurred on ''[[General Hospital]]'' between [[Luke Spencer]], [[Laura Spencer (General Hospital)|Laura Spencer]], and [[Scotty Baldwin]]. Similarly, [[romance film]]s also sustain this set-up until near the film's end, although they tend to establish a more clear-cut conclusion to the romantic entanglements than in long-running TV shows.{{citation needed|date=August 2011}}

==Related terms==

===Ménage à trois===
A love triangle should not be confused with a [[ménage à trois]], a three-way relationship in which either all members are romantically involved with each other, or one member has relations with two others who are reconciled to the situation instead of being in conflict. Ménage à trois is French and directly translates to "household for three" meaning it is usually composed of a "married couple and a lover...who live together while sharing sexual relations". This differs from a love triangle because each participant is equally motivated purely by sexual desires.  The ménage à trois may be considered a subset of 'The Sandwich...a straight three-handed operation...which may be operated with any assortment of sexes: three men, three women, two men and a woman ("''Ménage à trois''"), or two women and a man ("The Tourist Sandwich")'.<ref>Eric Berne, ''Sex in Human Loving'' (1970) p. 173</ref>

There is also the possibility of 'a ''ménage à trois'' powered by the passion of hatred'.<ref>Belinda Sterling, ''The Journal of Dora Damage'' (London 2007) p. 190</ref>{{elaboration needed|date=May 2017}}
