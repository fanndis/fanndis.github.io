'''Ethical Culture Fieldston School''' ('''ECFS'''), also referred to as '''Fieldston''',  is a private [[independent school]] in [[New York City]]. The school is a member of the [[Ivy Preparatory School League]]. The school serves approximately 1,700 students with 480 faculty and staff.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ecfs.org/about-ecfs/general-faq/index.aspx |title=Ethical Culture Fieldston School: General FAQ |publisher=Ecfs.org |date=November 19, 2015 |accessdate=December 1, 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151025233138/http://www.ecfs.org/about-ecfs/general-faq/index.aspx |archive-date=October 25, 2015 }}</ref> Jessica L.

'''Ethical Culture''', located on the [[Upper West Side]] of Manhattan, and '''Fieldston Lower''', located on the Fieldston campus in the Riverdale section of the Bronx, serve Pre-K through 5th grade.  The two lower schools feed into '''Fieldston Middle''' (6th–8th grades) and '''Fieldston Upper''' (9th–12th grades)—also located on the Fieldston campus in Riverdale. Ethical Culture is headed by Principal Rob Cousins, Fieldston Lower is headed by Principal Joe McCauley, Fieldston Middle is headed by Principal Chia-Chee Chiu, and Fieldston Upper is headed by Principal Nigel Furlonge. Tuition and fees for ECFS were $52,993 for the 2019–2020 school year.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ecfs.org/admissions/tuition-and-fees |title=Ethical Culture Fieldston School: Tuition and Fees |publisher=Ecfs.org |date=August 25, 2019 |accessdate=August 25, 2019}}</ref><ref name="ecfs.org">{{cite web |title=Frequently Asked Questions About Our Admissions Process |url=https://www.ecfs.org/en/frequently-asked-questions-about-our-admissions-process/ |publisher=ECFS |accessdate=6 November 2019}}</ref>

== History ==
[[File:301 WORKINGMEN'S SCHOOL, SOCIETY FOR ETHICAL CULTURE, 54 WEST 54TH STREET.jpg|thumb|Workingmens school, in 1893]]
[[File:33 Central Park West (Ethical Culture School) by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|Ethical Culture in New York City]]
[[File:Felix-Adler-Hine.jpeg|thumb|Felix Adler, circa 1913]]
The school opened in 1878 as a free [[kindergarten]], founded by [[Felix Adler (professor)|Felix Adler]] at the age of 24. In 1880, elementary grades were added, and the school was then called the Workingman's School. At that time, the idea that the children of the poor should be educated was innovative. By 1890 the school's academic reputation encouraged many more wealthy parents to seek it out, and the school was expanded to accommodate the upper-class as well, and began charging tuition; in 1895 the name changed to "The Ethical Culture School", and in 1903 the New York [[Society for Ethical Culture]] became its sponsor. Fieldston awards over $15 million in tuition-based financial aid to 22% of the student body.<ref>[http://www.ecfs.org/admissions/financial-aid/index.aspx]</ref><ref name="ecfs.org"/>

The school moved into its landmark Manhattan building at 33 Central Park West in 1904. The entire school was located in that building until 1928 when the high school division (Fieldston) moved to its 18-acre (73,000 m²) campus on Fieldston Road in the exclusive Fieldston section of [[Riverdale, Bronx|Riverdale]]; the Manhattan branch of the Lower School remained there, and  in 1932 a second Lower School was opened on the Riverdale campus. In 2007, a new middle school was opened on the same Riverdale campus, for the 6th, 7th, and 8th grades.

One of the early faculty members was the famous documentary photographer [[Lewis Hine]].

In March 1970, about 60 students occupied the administration building in protest to demand that more Black and Puerto Rican students be admitted to the school. They also aimed to have a greater number of minority courses, teachers, advisors, employees. The school agreed to some of the student demands.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Webster |first1=Bayard |title=60 Students Seize Fieldston School |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1970/03/24/archives/60-students-seize-fieldston-school.html |website=The New York Times |accessdate=6 November 2019 |date=24 March 1970}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Fieldston Board Threatens Expulsion of Protesters for Future Disruptions of the School |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1970/04/08/archives/fieldston-board-threatens-expulsion-of-protesters-for-future.html |website=The New York Times |date=8 April 1970}}</ref>

=== Recent developments ===

Beginning in 2015, the school began segregating children into "affinity groups" based on their self-identified race.  These "affinity groups", which are mandatory for all children beginning in third grade, meet weekly to discuss issues of race and bias. <ref>https://www.thecut.com/2015/05/can-fieldston-un-teach-racism.html</ref><ref>https://www.tabletmag.com/sections/news/articles/pride-and-prejudice-at-fieldston</ref>

In February 2019, a video that is believed to be created years previously was discovered by administrators after it was shared during a dispute between students. The students in the video use derogatory and racist language.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nypost.com/2019/02/25/bronx-private-school-students-caught-using-racist-homophobic-language-on-video/|title=Bronx private school students caught using racist, homophobic language on video|last=Algar|first=Selim|date=February 25, 2019|website=New York Post|language=en|access-date=March 18, 2019}}</ref> Students involved who were still enrolled in the school were punished, however some 100 students who thought the actions were not enough staged a sit-in reminiscent of the 1970 protest.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nypost.com/2019/03/14/protest-over-racist-private-school-video-ends-in-student-victory/|title=Protest over racist private school video ends in student victory|last=Algar|first=Selim|date=March 14, 2019|website=New York Post|language=en|access-date=March 18, 2019}}</ref> The students presented the administrators with twenty demands that included increased racial bias training, more faculty of color, the recruitment of more students of color, and a required ethnic studies course; the students' demands were agreed to and are planned to be implemented over the course of 2–3 years.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://newyork.cbslocal.com/2019/03/14/ethical-culture-fieldston-school-students-of-color-matter-bronx-riverdale/|title=Peaceful Demonstrations Lead To Big Victory For Students At Elite Ethical Culture Fieldston School|date=March 14, 2019|language=en|access-date=March 18, 2019}}</ref>[[File:WTM NewYorkDolls 002.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Fieldston Middle]]

The school also attracted attention in November 2019 after it hosted a guest speaker who engaged in [[antisemitic]] rhetoric.<ref>Hirsch, Ammiel and Joshua Davidson.

==Academics==
Fieldston dropped its participation in the [[Advanced Placement Program]] in 2002 to give its faculty the freedom to offer more innovative, challenging, and thought-provoking material. Students can take AP exams, but the school no longer officially sponsors such courses. While there was some concern that college admissions could be negatively affected, Fieldston's college office worked closely with admissions officers of schools across the country to explain the change and to assure that its students would be evaluated on the quality of its courses, even without the AP designation.<ref>{{cite web|last=Zhao |first=Yilu |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/02/01/nyregion/high-school-drops-its-ap-courses-and-colleges-don-t-seem-to-mind.html |title=High School Drops Its A.P.

==Athletics==
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2019}}
Fieldston's athletic program includes 62 teams covering 23 sports. The teams, known as the "Fieldston Eagles," play in the [[Ivy Preparatory School League]] against other private schools in the region. The school's hockey team as well as the girls and boys ultimate frisbee teams, however, do not play in the league and schedule their own games.
