====Foreign Affairs and Security Policy====
[[File:AshtonClinton.jpg|thumb|Ashton with U.S. Secretary of State [[Hillary Clinton]]]]
{{further|High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy#Ashton}}
On 19 November 2009, Ashton was appointed the EU's first [[High Representative]] of the Union for [[Foreign Affairs]] and [[Security policy]]. Her appointment was agreed at a summit by 27 European Union leaders in Brussels. Having initially pushed for former British Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]] to become President of the [[European Council]], [[Gordon Brown]] eventually relented on the condition that the post of [[High Commissioner|High Representative]] be awarded to a Briton.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8367589.stm|title=Belgian PM named as EU president|date=19 October 2009|work=BBC News|accessdate=20 March 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://uk.news.yahoo.com/18/20091119/tuk-uk-drops-blair-picks-ashton-for-eu-r-a7ad41d_1.html|title=UK drops Blair, picks Ashton for EU role|accessdate=20 March 2015|publisher=[[Yahoo News]]}}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

Ashton's relative obscurity prior to her appointment prompted comment in the media. ''[[The Guardian]]'' newspaper reported that her appointment as High Representative had received a "cautious welcome... from international relations experts".<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/nov/20/lady-ashton-eu-reaction Catherine Ashton: 'As trade commissioner she had a good reputation': British peer receives cautious welcome as EU foreign minister from international relations experts]{{spaced ndash}} ''The Guardian'', Friday 20 November 2009.</ref> ''[[The Economist]]'' described her as being a virtual unknown with paltry political experience, having no foreign-policy background and never having been elected to anything. The magazine credited her, however, with piloting the Lisbon Treaty through the House of Lords, handling the European Commission's Trade Portfolio without disagreement with her colleagues, and being suited to consensus-building.<ref>page12 ''The Economist'', 28 November–4 December 2009.</ref>

Critics predicted she would be out of her depth. [[Nile Gardiner]] of the [[Heritage Foundation]], who is on record as opposed to a European Union role in foreign and security policy on principle,<ref>See, for example, [http://www.heritage.org/research/reports/2010/05/four-key-principles-for-a-conservative-british-foreign-policy "Four Key Principles for a Conservative British Foreign Policy"], Web Memo 2911, The Heritage Foundation, 21 May 2010.

By contrast, former Home Secretary [[Charles Clarke]] said: "I have seen Cathy in action. I have great respect for her. She is excellent at building good relations with people and a good negotiator". [[Shami Chakrabarti]], the director of [[Liberty (pressure group)|Liberty]], a human-rights [[pressure group]], said: "people underestimate Cathy at their peril. She is not a great big bruiser. She is a persuader and a charmer.

Notable events of her term included:
* Establishing the [[European External Action Service]] (1 December 2010), which merged the external relations departments of the European Commission and the Council of the European Union, and was to have diplomats seconded from national foreign services. Throughout the first half of 2010 Ashton sought agreement between the Council, the Parliament and the Commission over the shape of the EEAS. Parliament agreed to the plan on 8 July, when MEPs approved the service by 549 votes for and 78 against with 17 abstentions. The Council approved the transfer of departments to the EAS on 20 July. Until the EEAS became operational, Ashton had been supported by a staff of about 30 people.<ref>Rettman, Andrew (8 July 2010) [http://euobserver.com/9/30448 EU takes 'historic' step on new diplomatic service], ''EUobserver''.

====Serbia-Kosovo====
In April 2013, after two years of negotiations, the governments of [[Serbia]] and [[Kosovo]] reached agreement to normalise their relations. Although Serbia did not formally recognise Kosovo as an [[independent state]], it did "in effect – concede that the government in Pristina has legal authority over the whole territory, including Serb-majority areas of northern Kosovo".<ref name="bbc.co.uk">Morris, Chris.

The agreement, which among other things removed obstacles to Serbia and Kosovo joining the European Union, followed Ashton's mediation of 10 rounds of talks between Serbia's Prime Minister, [[Ivica Dacic]], and Kosovo Prime Minister [[Hashim Thaci]].
A cross-party committee of the U.S. House of Representatives nominated Ashton and her fellow negotiators Dacic and Thaci for the Nobel Peace Prize.<ref>https://blogs.wsj.com/brussels/2013/12/24/a-nobel-peace-prize-for-catherine-ashton-in-2014/</ref> A similar nomination came from the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament<ref>http://www.socialistsanddemocrats.eu/newsroom/open-letter-nobel-peace-prize-nomination-sd-group-president-hannes-swoboda</ref>

====Iran====
After the November 2013 negotiation of an interim agreement with Iran over its nuclear programme, the ''[[Financial Times]]''  wrote that Ashton was "no longer the diplomatic dilettante". A senior French diplomat was quoted as saying, "I tip my hat to her.... She truly played a decisive role".  The report continued that, after initially insisting on negotiating only with other foreign ministers, by the latter stages of the negotiations the Iranian foreign minister [[Mohammad Javad Zarif]] "now... wanted to deal only with Lady Ashton". Said a western diplomat, "That the others agreed to this was significant. For China and Russia to be outside while she was in the room negotiating details was quite remarkable".<ref>Spiegeleisen, Peter. "Ashton no longer the diplomatic dilettante".  ''Financial Times'', 27 November 2013.</ref>

====Ukraine====

In December 2013 Ashton visited Kyiv. She said she was impressed by the "determination of Ukrainians demonstrating for the European perspective of their country" and observed "with sadness that police used force to remove peaceful people from the center of Kyiv... Dialogue with political forces and society and the use of arguments is always better than the argument of force".<ref name="europa.eu"/> Subsequently, Russian Deputy Prime Minister [[Dmitry Rogozin]] criticised Ashton's categorisation of the anti-government protests in [[Kyiv]] as peaceful in nature, pointing to the death of a number of police officers.<ref>[http://english.pravda.ru/news/world/21-02-2014/126897-rogozin_ashton-0 "If these are peaceful protests, then Ashton is a ballerina."], pravda.ru. Retrieved 20 March 2015.</ref>

At the beginning of March a recording of a conversation between Ashton and the Estonian foreign minister [[Urmas Paet]] was released. In the call, Paet said he had been told by a woman doctor named Olga that snipers responsible for killing police and civilians in Kyiv last month were protest movement provocateurs rather than supporters of then-president Viktor Yanukovych. Ashton responds: "I didn't know … Gosh." "So there is a stronger and stronger understanding that behind snipers it was not Yanukovych, it was somebody from the new coalition", Paet says. Ashton replies: "I think we do want to investigate. I didn't pick that up, that's interesting. Gosh", she says. The Estonian foreign ministry confirmed the accuracy of the leak but clarified that "Foreign Minister Paet was giving an overview of what he had heard in Kyiv and expressed concern over the situation on the ground. We reject the claim that Paet was giving an assessment of the opposition's involvement in the violence."<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/05/ukraine-bugged-call-catherine-ashton-urmas-paet "Ukraine bugged call"], 5 March 2014. Retrieved 20 March 2015.</ref> The woman doctor, Dr Olga Bogomolets, said in an interview reported by Paul Waldie of ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' that, in her conversation with the Estonian minister, "she did not indicate that protesters used snipers. She simply relayed to the Estonian minister what she saw that day – protesters shot in the head and heart. 'What I saw were people who were killed by snipers and only on [protesters'] side.'"<ref>Waldie, Paul.

On 28 March 2014 Ashton issued a news release condemning violence by members of the Ukrainian nationalist political party [[Right Sector]], stating, "I strongly condemn the pressure by activists of the Right Sector who have surrounded the building of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine. Such an intimidation of the parliament is against ... democratic principles and [the] rule of law. I call on the Right Sector and other parties in Ukraine to refrain from the use or threat of violence.

====Russia====

President Putin signed the new treason law on 12 November 2012. Ashton expressed concern at the new law "potentially penalizing contacts with foreign nationals with up to 20 years in prison" and reducing "the burden of proof for charges of treason and espionage". The [[United Nations Committee Against Torture]] stated that the new law could prohibit sharing information on the human rights situation in Russia with the United Nations human rights organs. According to Ashton, the March 2013 inspection wave in Russia seemed aimed at "undermining civil society activities".<ref>[https://www.hrw.org/node/115059 "Laws of Attrition: Crackdown on Russia's Civil Society after Putin's Return to the Presidency"], Human Rights Watch pdf report, 24 April 2013.

====Early phase as EU High Representative====
Ashton was questioned by Members of the European Parliament in 2009 about her role as national treasurer in the British [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]] in the 1980s, amid claims by its opponents that it may have had financial links to the [[Soviet Union]]. Ashton responded that she had not taken any "direct money from communist countries". Much of the organisation's funds had been "collected in buckets" at marches and demonstrations, she said, adding that she was the first to order an audit of CND's finances.<ref>[http://www.theinformationdaily.com/2009/12/03/eus-new-high-representative-catherine-ashton-says-that-she-would-help-europe-punch-its-weight-politically "EU's new High Representative Catherine Ashton says that she would help Europe 'punch its weight' politically"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131204034615/http://www.theinformationdaily.com/2009/12/03/eus-new-high-representative-catherine-ashton-says-that-she-would-help-europe-punch-its-weight-politically |date=4 December 2013 }}, theinformationdaily.com, 3 December 2009.

In February 2011, Ashton received the lowest grade in a survey rating the performance of European Commissioners. The survey, carried out by lobbying and PR company [[Burson-Marsteller]], asked 324 Brussels policy-makers to rate the European Commissioners with a grade of A to E (A being the highest).

In counterpoint to earlier criticism of Ashton for not travelling enough, in September 2012 ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' criticised her for not being present in Brussels for enough European Commission meetings, reporting that Ashton had missed 21 out of 32 regular weekly meetings held so far that year. To the paper's complaint that Ashton's absences were "leaving Britain without a voice" at such meetings, European diplomatic officials said that, under EU treaties, commissioners serve as representatives not of individual member countries but of the European interest. Ashton's staff also pointed to her personal involvement in nuclear negotiations with Iran as among the international responsibilities that had kept her away from Commission meetings.<ref>{{cite news|title=Baroness Ashton absent from two-thirds of European Commission meetings|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/eu/9555578/Baroness-Ashton-absent-from-two-thirds-of-European-Commission-meetings.html|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|date=20 September 2012|location=London|first=Bruno|last=Waterfield|accessdate=20 March 2015}}</ref>

The Polish Minister for European and Economic Affairs, [[Mikolaj Dowgielewicz]], stated in 2011 that criticism of Ashton was "a lot of hot air" and that "she has an impossible job to do and she is doing it well. At the end of her time in office, people will be more positive about what she has done. She will leave a real legacy."<ref name="PSE">Carroll, Dean.

Ashton was said in February 2010 to be angry over what she perceived as the "latent sexism" among some of her European peers that underpinned some of the criticisms aimed at her.<ref name="independent.co.uk"/> She told the press that her work was sometimes hampered by the limited resources provided to her.

====Later phase as EU High Representative====
The tone of public comment on Ashton's performance in office was subsequently to be influenced especially by her contributions to negotiations over Kosovo and Iran. In October 2013, ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' wrote of her:<blockquote>But now the 57-year-old baroness is suddenly at the center of world diplomacy. And whenever she is mentioned, she earns praise for her hard-nosed negotiating skills, her stamina and her diplomatic talents. It is said that U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry has much faith in her. "She is discrete and perceptive, but also tenacious.  That makes her an ideal negotiator", says Alexander Graf Lamsdorff, the head of Germany's business-friendly Free Democratic Party (FDP) in the European Parliament and a member of its Committee on Foreign Affairs.<ref>Schmitz, Gregor Peter and Christoph Schult.

Retrieved 20 March 2015.</ref></blockquote>

One of the critics of Ashton's appointment came to concede her effectiveness in office. In September 2013, [[Peter Oborne]], the chief political commentator of ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', wrote:<blockquote>Well, let's admit we were all completely wrong. It is now obvious that Catherine Ashton has been a success. In her unobtrusive but determined way, she can boast real achievement. Last year a peace deal was struck between Serbia and Kosovo. Nobody had thought it possible. It was a massive step towards healing ancient hatreds and building economic prosperity. It was brokered by Baroness Ashton.... I have never met Baroness Ashton but I guess that one of her secrets is that she keeps her head down, does not flaunt her ego, and allows others to take the credit. It takes little imagination to envisage how a male politician from any of the main parties would have exploited the Kosovo peace-deal, or the Morsi visit. She just kept her head down and quietly got on with her job.<ref>Oborne, Peter. [http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/peteroborne/100238311/we-were-all-wrong-about-baroness-ashton-she-may-save-the-iran-nuclear-talks "We were all wrong about Baroness Ashton. She may save the Iran nuclear talks".], ''The Daily Telegraph'', 27 September 2013. Retrieved 20 March 2015.</ref></blockquote>

In July 2014, as discussions took place on the selection of Ashton's successor, Paul Taylor of [[Reuters]] wrote in ''[[The New York Times]]'', as part of a larger critique of the political nature of appointments to the European Commission:<blockquote>While Ms. Ashton had some successes, brokering a first accord between Serbia and Kosovo and leading negotiations for an interim nuclear deal between Iran and world powers, critics say she has too often been missing in action closer to home.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/22/business/international/european-union-has-a-strange-way-of-picking-leaders.html?_r=0 EU has a strange way of picking leaders], ''The New York Times''. Retrieved 20 March 2015.</ref></blockquote>

Reflecting on her record, in July 2014, Adam Boulton in the UK's Sunday Times concluded:
<blockquote> As the European Union's high representative for foreign affairs and security policy, Catherine Ashton still bestrides the international stage four years after Gordon Brown, the man who gave her the job, was expelled from the corridors of power. She was a surprise nominee to everyone including herself, and few would have expected then that her successor as Britain's commissioner would struggle to match Baroness Ashton in calibre and clout.<ref>[http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/comment/columns/adamboulton/article1433571.ece]</ref></blockquote>
