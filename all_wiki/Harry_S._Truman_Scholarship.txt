The '''Harry S. Truman Scholarship''' is the premier graduate fellowship in the United States for public service leadership.<ref>https://www.truman.gov/our-mission/who-we-are</ref> It is a federally funded [[scholarship]] granted to U.S. undergraduate students for demonstrated leadership potential, academic excellence, and a commitment to public service.<ref>https://www.truman.gov/</ref> It is administered by the Harry S. Truman Scholarship Foundation, an independent federal agency based in [[Washington, D.C.]]

[[United States Congress|Congress]] created the scholarship in 1975 as a living [[memorial]] to [[Harry S Truman|the 33rd president of the United States]]. Instead of a statue, the Truman Scholarship is the official federal memorial to its namesake president. According to the ''[[Washington Post]]'', the Truman Scholarship's "sole aim is to pick out people with potential to become leaders—then provide support to help them realize their aspirations."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/08/27/AR2006082700747.html|title=Present Scholars, Future Leaders|first=Anushka|last=Asthana|date=28 August 2006|publisher=|via=washingtonpost.com}}</ref> The scholarship supports public service oriented graduate study in the amount of $30,000.

Each year, between 50 and 60 university nominated candidates in their junior year are named Truman Scholars following a rigorous application process involving essays, recommendations, and an interview.<ref name="truman.gov">{{cite web|url=https://www.truman.gov/candidates/faq-candidates/|title=FAQ – Candidates – The Harry S. Truman Scholarship Foundation|publisher=}}</ref> Scholarships have historically been awarded to one individual from each U.S. state.<ref>https://www.truman.gov/candidates/how-become-truman-scholar</ref> Each university in the United States may only nominate four candidates annually, who represent the most accomplished nominees from that university.<ref>https://www.truman.gov/candidates/how-become-truman-scholar</ref>

== History ==
On May 30, 1974, Senator [[Stuart Symington]] of [[Missouri]] sponsored S.3548,<ref>[https://www.congress.gov/bill/93rd-congress/senate-bill/3548 S.3548]</ref> formally titled "A bill to establish the Harry S. Truman Memorial Scholarships." Symington held the same [[List of United States Senators from Missouri|Class 1 Senate seat]] that Truman had held from 1935–1945 before becoming [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]]. The [[United States Senate|Senate]] passed the bill on August 2, and the [[United States House of Representatives|House]] followed suit on December 17. Two similar House bills, H.R.15138<ref>[https://www.congress.gov/bill/93rd-congress/house-bill/15138 H.R.15138]</ref> sponsored by [[William J. Randall]] of [[Missouri]] and H.R.17481<ref>[https://www.congress.gov/bill/93rd-congress/house-bill/17481 H.R.17481]</ref> sponsored by [[James G. O'Hara]] of [[Michigan]], were set aside in favor of Symington's bill.

The bill was signed by [[President of the United States|President]] [[Gerald Ford]] and enacted as Public Law 93-642 on January 4, 1975 and entered the [[United States Statutes at Large]] as 88 Stat. 2276–2280, and the [[United States Code]] as 20 U.S.C. 2001–2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode20/usc_sup_01_20_10_42.html|title=20 U.S. Code Chapter 42 – HARRY S TRUMAN MEMORIAL SCHOLARSHIPS|publisher=}}</ref> It now operates as Program 85.001, governed by 45 CFR 1801<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.access.gpo.gov/nara/cfr/waisidx_04/45cfr1801_04.html|title=Public Welfare|publisher=|access-date=2006-07-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060928173137/http://www.access.gpo.gov/nara/cfr/waisidx_04/45cfr1801_04.html|archive-date=2006-09-28|url-status=dead}}</ref> as published in the [[Code of Federal Regulations]] in the [[Federal Register]].

== Governance ==
[[File:Truman Foundation logo.jpg|thumb|Harry S. Truman Scholarship Foundation]]
The Truman Scholarship is administered by the Harry S. Truman Scholarship Foundation, an independent federal executive branch agency. It is governed by a 13-member Board of Trustees headed by President [[Madeleine Albright]], who says the foundation "serves as a gateway for America's public service leaders" and "does a remarkable job of identifying future change agents." <ref>[http://www.truman.gov/about/about_list.htm?cat_id=467 Truman Scholarship Foundation members] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060710182014/http://www.truman.gov/about/about_list.htm?cat_id=467 |date=2006-07-10 }}</ref> The Foundation's operations<ref>https://www.truman.gov/officers-board-trustees</ref> are overseen by full-time Executive Secretary [[Terry Babcock-Lumish]].  Its endowment, which takes the form of a federal trust fund held in the [[U.S. Department of the Treasury]], is $55 million. Current Board members include Senator [[Roy Blunt]], Senator [[Brian Schatz]], Secretary of Education [[Betsy DeVos]], Congressman [[Kay Granger]], and Congressman [[Ted Deutch]].

== Qualifications ==
The scholarship is awarded to between 50 and 60 U.S. college juniors each year on the basis of four criteria:<ref>[http://www.truman.gov/faq/faq_show.htm?doc_id=249095 Primary selection criteria for scholarship] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060924030815/http://www.truman.gov/faq/faq_show.htm?doc_id=249095 |date=2006-09-24 }}</ref> service on campus and in the community, commitment to a career in public service (government, uniformed services, research, education, or public interest/advocacy organizations), communication ability and aptitude to be a "change agent," and academic talent that would assure acceptance to a first-rate graduate school.  More broadly, Truman Scholars possess intellect, leadership skills, and passion that would make them a likely force for the public good in any field.<ref>[http://www.truman.gov/faq/faq_show.htm?doc_id=246879 Who are Truman Scholars?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060924030913/http://www.truman.gov/faq/faq_show.htm?doc_id=246879 |date=2006-09-24 }}</ref>

== Application process ==
In order to apply for the scholarship, students must first win the nomination of their undergraduate university. Each undergraduate institution in the United States is allowed to nominate up to four students who have attended since freshman year. After nomination, annually the Foundation receives 900 applications, of whom between 50 and 60 will be selected each year.<ref name="truman.gov" /> Each nominated application is then examined by a regional review panel, which selects finalists to interview. The interviews are conducted by panels of former Truman scholars, trustees of the board, and notable national public servants. These panelists then make final selections of scholarship winners, generally attempting to choose one from each of the 50 states and American territories. No particular career, service interest, or policy field is preferred during the process.  Each year, the Truman Scholarship is awarded to one or two students from institutions that have never had a Truman Scholar.<ref>[http://www.truman.gov/faq/faq_show.htm?doc_id=249198 There has never been a Truman Scholar from my school. Do I have a chance?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060924030632/http://www.truman.gov/faq/faq_show.htm?doc_id=249198 |date=2006-09-24 }}</ref>

== Benefits ==
[[File:TSA LOGO.jpg|thumb|150px|Truman Scholars Association]]
Scholars currently receive an award of $30,000 going toward up to three years of graduate education leading to a career in the public service.<ref>[http://www.truman.gov/faq/faq_show.htm?doc_id=244611 What benefits do Truman Scholars receive?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060924031037/http://www.truman.gov/faq/faq_show.htm?doc_id=244611 |date=2006-09-24 }}</ref> Winners also benefit from a network of other scholars through the [http://www.trumanscholars.org/ Truman Scholars Association] and lasting friendship, which is encouraged by the Truman Scholars Leadership Week at [[William Jewell College]] in [[Liberty, Missouri]], and the [[Harry S. Truman Presidential Library and Museum|Truman Library]] in [[Independence, Missouri]], during which new scholars collaborate on policy projects. Scholars accept a 10-week Summer Institute internship in [[Washington, D.C.]], which features additional professional development training. Of this group, a small number continue federal agency jobs for a full year as part of the Truman Albright Fellows program.

Certain graduate and professional schools, including the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs, give some degree of priority and funding to applicants who are Truman Scholars. Truman Scholars are exempt from taking the written section of the [[United States Foreign Service|U.S. Foreign Service Exam]]. Scholars also automatically become part of the [[Truman Scholars Association]], independent  non-profit that works to foster additional opportunities and networking for Scholars.
