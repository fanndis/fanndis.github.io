==History==
[[File:Evanston Skyline 4.JPG|thumb|A part of downtown Evanston, as seen in October 2005]]

Prior to the 1830s, the area now occupied by Evanston was mainly uninhabited, consisting largely of wetlands and swampy forest. However, [[Potawatomi]] Indians used trails along higher lying ridges that ran in a general north–south direction through the area, and had at least some semi-permanent settlements along the trails.

French explorers referred to the general area as "Grosse Pointe" after a point of land jutting into Lake Michigan about {{convert|13|mi|0}} north of the mouth of the [[Chicago River]]. After the first non-Native Americans settled in the area in 1836, the names "Grosse Point Territory" and "Gross Point voting district" were used through the 1830s and 1840s, although the territory had no defined boundaries.<ref name="Currey-ISHS">{{Cite book| last1 = Illinois State Historical Society | last2 = Currey | first2 = Seymour | title = Transactions of the Illinois State Historical Society for the year 1908 | chapter = Chicago's North Shore | publisher = Illinois State Historical Library | year = 1909 | location = Springfield, Illinois | pages = 101–109 | chapter-url = https://books.google.com/books?id=-EXWAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA109 | accessdate = August 26, 2010 }}</ref><ref name="LWV">"This is Evanston," League of Women Voters of Evanston, 2000, {{ISBN|0-9676994-0-1}} {{cite web|url=http://www.lwve.org/pdf/Complete-ThisIsEvanston.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=February 6, 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325113813/http://www.lwve.org/pdf/Complete-ThisIsEvanston.pdf |archivedate=March 25, 2009 }} pp. 8–18</ref> The area remained only sparsely settled, supporting some farming and lumber activity on some of the higher ground, as well as a number of taverns or "hotels" along the ridge roads. Grosse Pointe itself steadily eroded into the lake during this period.

In 1850, a [[Civil township|township]] called [[Ridgeville Township, Illinois|Ridgeville]] was organized, extending from [[Graceland Cemetery]] in Chicago to the southern edge of the [[Antoine Ouilmette|Ouilmette Reservation]], along what is now [[Central Street (Evanston, Illinois)|Central Street]], and from Lake Michigan to [[Western Avenue (Chicago)|Western Avenue]] in Chicago. The 1850 census shows a few hundred settlers in this township,<ref name="LWV"/> and a post office with the name of Ridgeville was established at one of the taverns. However, no municipality yet existed.

In 1851, a group of [[Methodism|Methodist]] business leaders founded [[Northwestern University]] and [[Garrett Biblical Institute]].  Unable to find available land on the north shore up to Lake Forest, the committee was ready to purchase farmland to the west of the city when [[Orrington Lunt]] insisted on one final visit to the present location.<ref name="The Story of Evanston">{{cite book |last=Willard |first=Frances|authorlink=Frances Willard |date=1891 |title=A Classic Town: The Story of Evanston |publisher=Woman's Temperance Publishing Association |edition=1st |url=https://archive.org/details/aclassictownsto00willgoog |page=[https://archive.org/details/aclassictownsto00willgoog/page/n27 19] |access-date=February 17, 2006}}</ref> They chose a bluffed and wooded site along the lake as Northwestern's home, purchasing several hundred acres of land from Dr. John Foster, a Chicago farm owner.

Evanston was formally incorporated as a [[Town (Illinois)|town]] on December 29, 1863, but declined in 1869 to become a city despite the Illinois legislature passing a bill for that purpose. Evanston expanded after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] with the annexation of the village of North Evanston. Finally, in early 1892, following the annexation of the village of South Evanston, voters elected to organize as a city.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia | last = | first = | author = | authorlink = |authors= | editor = Newton Bateman |editor2=Paul Selby | encyclopedia = Historical Encyclopedia of Illinois | title = Evanston | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=lxoVAAAAYAAJ&q=Northwestern+University+founders+railroad&pg=PA159 | accessdate = December 14, 2008 | edition = | year = 1917 | publisher = Munsell Publishing Co. | volume = 1 | location = Chicago | id = | doi = | pages = 160 | quote = }}</ref> The 1892 boundaries are largely those that exist today.

In August 1954, Evanston hosted the second assembly of the [[World Council of Churches]], still the only WCC assembly to have been held in the United States. President [[Dwight Eisenhower]] welcomed the delegates, and [[Dag Hammarskjöld]], secretary-general of the [[United Nations]], delivered an important address entitled "An instrument of faith".<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www2.wcc-coe.org/pressreleasesen.nsf/index/Feat-04-40.html | title = Evanston After Fifty Years | accessdate = December 18, 2008 | last = Hjelm | first = Norman A. | date = September 14, 2004 | publisher = World Council of Churches | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080704071257/http://www2.wcc-coe.org/pressreleasesen.nsf/index/Feat-04-40.html | archivedate = July 4, 2008 | df = mdy-all }}</ref>

Evanston first received power in April 1893.  Many people lined the streets on Emerson St. where the first appearance of street lights were lined and turned on. Today, the city is home to Northwestern University, [[Music Institute of Chicago]], and other educational institutions, as well as headquarters of [[Alpha Phi]] International women's [[fraternity]], [[Rotary International]], the [[National Merit Scholarship Corporation]], the National [[Lekotek]] Center, the [[Sigma Alpha Epsilon]] fraternity, the [[Sigma Chi]] fraternity and the [[Woman's Christian Temperance Union]].

Evanston is the birthplace of [[Tinkertoy]]s, and is the one of the locations having originated the ice cream [[sundae]].<ref>History Channel - Modern Marvels - "Ice Cream Tech" - (2008)</ref> Evanston was the home of the Clayton Mark and Company, which for many years supplied the most jobs.<ref>{{cite news | title = Clayton Mark Products Used Throughout the World | newspaper = Evansbriar Review | date = May 7, 1953}}</ref>

Evanston was a [[dry town|dry community]] from 1858 until 1972, when the City Council voted to allow restaurants and hotels to serve liquor on their premises. In 1984, the Council voted to allow retail liquor outlets within the city limits.<ref>Foerstner, Abigail. "Evanston liquor store to close door on era." ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''. July 6, 1984. p.

==Government and politics==
The City of Evanston became sister cities with the [[Dniprovskyi District, Kyiv|Dnieprovsky District]] of the City of [[Kyiv]], Ukraine in 1988, and sister cities with [[Belize City|Belize City, Belize]] in 1992.

Evanston has a [[Council&ndash;manager government|council-manager]] system of government and is divided into nine wards, each of which is represented by an Alderman, or member of the Evanston City Council.  Businessman [[Steve Hagerty]] was elected mayor in April 2017, replacing [[Elizabeth Tisdahl]], who had served since 2009.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://evanstonnow.com/story/government/bill-smith/election-2017/2017-04-08/77346/hagerty-lead-shrinks-as-late-vote-count|title=Hagerty lead shrinks as late-vote count continues|last=Smith|first=Bill|date=April 8, 2017|work=Evanston Now|access-date=April 13, 2017|language=en-US}}</ref> Hagerty, who won election by a margin of only 111 votes,<ref>{{cite web|title=Suburban Cook County Election Results April 04, 2017 Consolidated General Election|url=http://results417.cookcountyclerk.com/summary.aspx?eid=40417|publisher=Cook County Clerk|accessdate=April 14, 2017}}</ref> was sworn into office on May 8.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Bookwalter|first1=Genevieve|title=Candidate concedes in Evanston mayoral race|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/suburbs/evanston/news/ct-evr-tendam-concedes-mayoral-race-tl-0413-20170410-story.html|accessdate=April 14, 2017|work=chicagotribune.com}}</ref>

Evanston was heavily [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] in voter identification from the time of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] up to the 1960s. [[Richard Nixon|Nixon]] carried Evanston in the 1968 presidential election.<ref>{{cite news | title = Affluent Settled Evanston, Illinois | date = March 15, 1971 | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,904827,00.html | work = Time | accessdate = September 18, 2011}}</ref> The city began trending [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] in the 1960s, though it did not elect a Democratic mayor until 1993. The city swung particularly heavily to the Democrats in the 1990s, along with many other Chicago suburbs, and now almost exclusively identifies with Democrats in elections on all levels of government.

===Lorraine H. Morton===
{{main|Lorraine H. Morton}}
Lorraine Hairston Morton (December 8, 1918 – September 8, 2018) was Evanston's longest serving mayor. In 1993, Morton ran for mayor of Evanston under the campaign slogan "Morton for Mayor," which accompanied images of trains and lists of people who were "on board" with her campaign. After a run-off election against Ann Rainey, alderman of Evanston's Eighth Ward, Morton was elected Evanston's first African-American and first Democratic mayor. 

Morton was in office for sixteen years (until 2009), becoming Evanston's longest-serving mayor. During her long mayoral tenure, Morton attempted to improve the town-gown relationship between Northwestern University and the greater population of Evanston. She was able to form a close friendship with Northwestern University president [[Henry Bienen]] and ameliorate the tension between Evanston and the University given her status as both the Mayor of Evanston and a proud alumna of Northwestern. 

Mayor Morton also worked with local community leaders and churches to create a safe zone and a ("time out") period of time that gangs would call a truce. During this time, (Friday and Saturday nights, a time of would-be heightened gang activity) the community, including gang members were invited to play basketball at Evanston's [[Robert Crown Center]]. Morton would often be seen cheering from the sidelines. Evanston's civic center was renamed for Morton at the time of her retirement in 2009 and is now known as the [[Lorraine H. Morton Civic Center]]. In addition to being Evanston's first African-American, Democratic, and longest-serving mayor, Morton is also notable for spearheading the desegregation of Evanston's public schools as a teacher and school principal.

==Education==

===Public schools===

====High school====
[[File:Evanston Township High School front.jpg|thumb|[[Evanston Township High School]]]]
Most of Evanston (and a small part of the village of [[Skokie, Illinois|Skokie]]) is within the boundaries of Evanston Township High School District 202.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.eths.k12.il.us//cms/lib/IL01903927/Centricity/Domain/220/ETHS%20School%20Profile%202018-19.pdf|title=EVANSTON TOWNSHIP HIGH SCHOOL 2018-19 School Profile|publisher=Evanston Township High School|accessdate=2019-07-17}}</ref> The school district has a single high school, [[Evanston Township High School]], with an enrollment of just over 4,000, covering grades 9 through 12.

====Primary schools====
[[Evanston-Skokie Community Consolidated School District 65]], covering all of Evanston and a small part of Skokie, provides [[primary education]] from pre-[[kindergarten]] through grade 8. The district has ten elementary schools (kindergarten through fifth grade), three [[middle school]]s (grades 6 through 8), two [[magnet school]]s (K through 8), two special schools or centers, and an early childhood school.

===Tertiary===
In 2006, [[National-Louis University]] closed its former main site, which had {{convert|6.5|acre|ha}} of land, with about 33%<!--one third as per source--> in Evanston; the majority of the land was in [[Wilmette, Illinois|Wilmette]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Brachear, Manya A.|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-2004-05-07-0405070268-story.html|title=National-Louis to move campus|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|date=2004-05-07|accessdate=2019-07-31}}</ref>

===University===
Founded in 1855, Evanston is home to [[Northwestern University]], one of the nation's leading research universities. Located along Lake Michigan, Northwestern's [[Campus of Northwestern University|campus]] spans 240 acres with an estimated 250 buildings.

==Transportation==
[[File:Evanston 1170.jpg|thumb|right|Shops along Davis Street, looking west, August 2006. The Davis Street [[Metra]] stop is visible in the lower half of the photograph.]]
Evanston's growth occurred largely because of its accessibility from Chicago by rail. The Northwestern founders did not finalize their commitment to siting the university there until they were assured the [[Chicago & Milwaukee Railway]] line would run there. C&M trains began stopping in Evanston in 1855.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.library.northwestern.edu/about/welcome/history-the-library-0 | title = History of Northwestern University Library | accessdate = December 14, 2008 | date = March 3, 2001 | publisher = Northwestern University Library | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110709015418/http://www.library.northwestern.edu/about/welcome/history-the-library-0 | archivedate = July 9, 2011 | df = mdy-all }}</ref> Evanston later experienced rapid growth as one of the first [[streetcar suburb]]s. The [[Chicago North Shore and Milwaukee Railroad|North Shore Line]], the interurban railroad that gave the area its [[North Shore (Chicago)|nickname]], ran through Evanston and continued to [[Waukegan, Illinois|Waukegan]] and [[Milwaukee]].

The city is still connected to Chicago by rail transit. The [[Chicago Transit Authority|CTA]]'s [[Purple Line (CTA)|Purple Line]], part of the [[Chicago 'L']] system, runs through Evanston. From its terminal at [[Howard (CTA station)|Howard]] in Chicago, the line heads north to the [[South Boulevard (CTA station)|South Boulevard]], [[Main (CTA station)|Main]], [[Dempster (CTA Purple Line station)|Dempster]], [[Davis (CTA station)|Davis]], [[Foster (CTA station)|Foster]], [[Noyes (CTA station)|Noyes]], and [[Central (CTA Purple Line station)|Central]] stations, before terminating at the [[Linden (CTA station)|Linden]] station in [[Wilmette, Illinois]]. [[Metra]]'s [[Union Pacific/North Line]] also serves Evanston, with stations at [[Evanston Main Street (Metra)|Main Street]], [[Evanston Davis Street (Metra)|Davis Street]] and [[Evanston Central Street (Metra)|Central Street]], the first two being adjacent to Purple Line stations. The CTA's [[Yellow Line (CTA)|Yellow Line]] also runs through the city, though it does not stop there. Evanston is served by six CTA bus routes as well as four [[Pace (transit)|Pace]] bus routes.

Automobile routes from Chicago to Evanston include [[Lake Shore Drive]], the [[Edens Expressway]] ([[Interstate 94|I-94]]), and McCormick Boulevard, although the first two of those do not extend to Evanston itself and require driving through [[Rogers Park, Chicago|Rogers Park]] (via Sheridan Road or Ridge Avenue) and Skokie, respectively. The main routes from the north are the Edens, Green Bay Road, and Sheridan Road. Active modes of transportation include miles of sidewalks and bicycle lanes.

==Economy==
Companies based in Evanston include [[ZS Associates]].
