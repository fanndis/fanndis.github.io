'''Martin Schulz''' (born 20 December 1955)<ref name=Munzinger/> is a German politician who served as [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Leader of the Social Democratic Party]] 2017 to 2018, and has served as a Member of the [[Bundestag]] (MdB) since 2017. Previously he was [[President of the European Parliament]] from 2012 to 2017, Leader of the [[Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats]] from 2004 to 2012 and a [[Member of the European Parliament]] (MEP) from [[Germany]] from 1994 to 2017.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://online.wsj.com/articles/german-socialist-martin-schulz-elected-president-of-european-parliament-1404216532|access-date=1 July 2014|title=German Socialist Martin Schulz Re-Elected as European Parliament President|newspaper=Wall Street Journal|date=July 2014|last1=Dalton|first1=Matthew}}</ref>

In November 2016, Schulz announced he would not seek a third term as President of the European Parliament, but instead would [[2017 German federal election|stand in 2017 as the SPD candidate]] for the [[Chancellor of Germany|German Chancellorship]]. In January 2017, [[Sigmar Gabriel]] announced he would not stand for re-election as party leader and as the SPD candidate for the German Chancellorship, Gabriel recommended Schulz as his replacement.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://euobserver.com/tickers/136652|title=Martin Schulz to be candidate for German chancellor}}</ref>

After the elections of September 2017, which resulted in a postwar low for the SPD, Schulz declared the end of the existing Grand coalition under Angela Merkel and explicitly refused to serve in a Merkel government. On 7 February 2018, coalition talks concluded and Schulz announced he would succeed Sigmar Gabriel as Foreign minister and leave his party chairmanship to [[Andrea Nahles]]. After heavy public and internal criticism, Schulz decided not to enter the new cabinet. On 13 February 2018 Schulz stepped down as party chair.

==Early life==
Martin Schulz was born in the village of Hehlrath, which is now a part of [[Eschweiler]]<ref name=Munzinger/> in western Rhineland, near the Dutch and Belgian borders, as one of five children. His father, Albert Schulz, was a local policeman and belonged to a social democratic family; his mother, Clara, belonged to a conservative Catholic family and was active in the [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|Christian Democratic Union]]. Having grown up in the border area between Germany, [[Belgium]] and the [[Netherlands]], Schulz has relatives in all three countries.<ref name="auto">Markus Feldenkirchen and Horand Knaup (25 November 2016), [http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/eu-parliament-president-schulz-could-shake-up-german-politics-a-1123130.html Schulz Heads to Berlin: The Man Who Could Shake Up German Politics] ''[[Spiegel Online]]''.</ref>

After four years at primary school, from 1962 to 1966, Schulz attended the [[Gymnasium (Germany)|Heilig-Geist (Holy Spirit) gymnasium]], a private Roman Catholic school run by the [[Holy Ghost Fathers]] (or Spiritans),<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://hgg-broich.de/informationen |title=Archived copy |access-date=27 April 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130422224342/http://hgg-broich.de/informationen/ |archive-date=22 April 2013 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> in Broich (now [[Würselen]]), a district of the town of Broichweiden, for nine years.<ref name="latimesaplainspokengermanpopulist">{{cite news|last1=Kirschbaum|first1=Erik|title=A plain-spoken German populist may have a shot at ousting Angela Merkel|url=http://www.latimes.com/world/europe/la-fg-germany-shulz-2017-story.html|access-date=10 February 2017|work=The Los Angeles Times|date=8 February 2017}}</ref> As a teenager, he went to France on a school exchange programme.<ref name=Munzinger/> He left school without passing his [[Abitur]] after failing the 11th grade twice.<ref name=Spiegel>{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/martin-schulz-could-present-serious-challenge-to-angela-merkel-in-german-election-a-1132362.html |title=Martin Schulz could present serious challenge to Angela Merkel in German election|date=1 February 2017|publisher=[[Der Spiegel]]}}</ref>

From 1975 to 1977 Schulz then trained to be a bookseller.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/meps/de/1911/Martin_SCHULZ.html|access-date=30 January 2012|title=Martin Schulz MEP}}</ref> The next two years he worked for a number of publishing houses and bookshops. Schulz suffered from [[alcoholism]] and tried to commit suicide on 26 June 1980. After a successful [[Drug rehabilitation|rehab]] Schulz opened his own bookshop in Würselen in 1982.<ref name=Spiegel/>

==Early career in municipal politics, 1987–1998==
In 1974, at the age of 19, Schulz joined the [[SPD]], became involved with the [[Young Socialists in the SPD|Young Socialists]] and in 1984 was elected to the Würselen Municipal Council, remaining a member for just over two electoral terms, to 1998, from 1987 onwards as mayor.<ref name="fttheveteranmep">{{cite news|last1=Wagstyl|first1=Stefan|title=Martin Schulz, the veteran MEP challenging for Merkel's crown|url=https://www.ft.com/content/78e5471a-eeb9-11e6-930f-061b01e23655|access-date=10 February 2017|work=Financial Times|date=10 February 2017}}</ref> At 31,<ref name="latimesaplainspokengermanpopulist"/> he was then the youngest mayor in [[North Rhine-Westphalia]].

==Member of the European Parliament (MEP), 1994–2017==
[[File:14-02-04-strasbourgh-napolitano-RalfR-26.jpg|thumb|Martin Schulz with Italian President [[Giorgio Napolitano]] in 2014.]]

In the [[1994 European Parliament election in Germany|1994 European elections]] Schulz was elected to the European Parliament and between 2000 and 2004 was chair of the SPD delegation. Schulz has served on a number of committees, including the [[European Parliament Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs|Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs]] and the [[European Parliament Subcommittee on Human Rights|Subcommittee on Human Rights]]. He led the German delegation of the Socialist group (SPD members) from 2000 and was also a vice-chair of the Socialist Group in the EP. He was elected group leader in 2004, of the PSE Group, succeeding the Spaniard [[Enrique Barón Crespo]], a position held until he was elected EP president. Since 2009, Schulz has also acted as the representative for European Affairs for Germany's SPD party and his views have deeply influenced his party's pro-European politics.

In 2004 as Leader of the S&D group, Schulz introduced a motion in the European Parliament to refuse to give approval/consent to the [[Barroso Commission]] on the basis of the proposed appointment of Italian nominee [[Rocco Buttiglione]] and his publicly expressed homophobic views. A large majority of MEPs from the other political groups followed and consequently Buttiglione was withdrawn and replaced by [[Franco Frattini]].

By 2008, SPD chairman [[Kurt Beck]] has said he wanted Schulz to succeed [[Günter Verheugen]] as Germany's EU commissioner following the [[2009 European Parliament election in Germany|2009 European elections]]; the post eventually went to [[Günther Oettinger]].<ref>Florian Gathmann (1 May 2008), [http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/spiegel-online-interview-with-mep-martin-schulz-it-s-an-honor-to-be-considered-for-eu-commissioner-a-550941.html SPIEGEL ONLINE Interview with MEP Martin Schulz 'It's an Honor to Be Considered for EU Commissioner'] ''[[Spiegel Online]]''.</ref>

===President of the European Parliament, 2012–2017===
[[File:Remise du Prix Sakharov à Aung San Suu Kyi Strasbourg 22 octobre 2013-14.jpg|right|thumb|The ceremony of the [[Sakharov Prize]] awarded to [[Aung San Suu Kyi]] by Schulz, inside the [[European Parliament]]'s Strasbourg hemicycle, in 2013]]
Following the [[2009 European Parliament election in Germany|2009 European elections]] Schulz came to public attention when he insisted that his group should not immediately approve a second term of office for [[European Commission]] President [[Jose Manuel Barroso]] and instead, together with the Chair of the [[The Greens–European Free Alliance|Green Group]] in the European Parliament, [[Daniel Cohn-Bendit]], proposed the Belgian Liberal [[Guy Verhofstadt]] as a candidate for that office.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.euractiv.com/eu-elections/support-growing-verhofstadt-replace-barroso/article-183074|access-date=30 January 2012|title=Support for Verhofstadt as Barroso's successor grows }}</ref> Following reassurances by Barroso, Schulz dropped his categorical opposition to him, insisting only that he should make certain [[concession (politics)|political concessions]] to the Social Democrats.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.euractiv.com/de/eu-wahlen/spe-uneins-namensnderung-barroso/article-183701|access-date=30 January 2012|title=Socialists split over name change, Barroso }}</ref> As a result, the majority of the group abstained on the confidence vote to Barroso.

[[File:Selahattin Demirtaş and Martin Schulz.jpg|230px|thumbnail|Schulz meeting with the Turkish opposition politician [[Selahattin Demirtaş]], who was later arrested]]
On 15 September 2011, members of the [[Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats]] in the European Parliament unanimously nominated Schulz as their candidate for the President of the European Parliament. On 17 January 2012, Schulz was elected as President of the European Parliament, with 387 votes in favour out of 670 cast.<ref name=ep_election>{{cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/news-room/content/20120113IPR35350/html/Martin-Schulz-elected-President-of-the-European-Parliament|title=Martin Schulz elected President of the European Parliament – News – European Parliament|date=17 January 2012}}</ref> Other candidates were [[Nirj Deva]] (142 votes) and [[Diana Wallis]] (141 votes).<ref name=ep_election/>

Together with EU Commission President Barroso and EU Council President [[Herman van Rompuy]], Schulz collected the [[2012 Nobel Peace Prize]] on behalf of the European Union. The Prize, honoring "over six decades [having] contributed to the advancement of peace and reconciliation, democracy and human rights in Europe", was awarded by a unanimous decision of the Norwegian [[Nobel Committee]].

As president of European Parliament, Schulz proved extremely adept at delicate diplomatic missions, such as his visit with Turkish President [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]] following the [[2016 Turkish coup d'état attempt|2016 coup attempt]] and his visit with Iranian President [[Hassan Rohani]] in November 2015 to "intensify dialogue" between the EU and Iran a few months after the signing of the [[Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action]].<ref name="auto"/>

In November 2016, Schulz announced that he would not run for a third term in January 2017, and instead return to German politics.<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-eu-germany-schulz-idUSKBN13J0M2|title=EU's Schulz steps down, fuelling German, EU reshuffles|last=Macdonald|first=Alastair|date=24 November 2016|last2=Blenkinsop|first2=Philip|newspaper=Reuters|access-date=24 November 2016}}</ref> He resigned his seat on 10 February 2017, leaving the European Parliament after more than twenty-two years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/meps/en/1911/MARTIN_SCHULZ_history.html|title=Martin Schulz – History of Parliamentary Service|access-date=12 February 2017}}</ref>

===Candidacy for President of the European Commission===
On 6 November 2013, Schulz was nominated as "candidate designate" by the Party of European Socialists – at the time the second-largest group in the 750-seat parliament –, with the aim to become the first candidate to be elected President of the European Commission by democratic elections.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pes.eu/en/news/european-socialists-elect-martin-schulz-candidate-commission-president|title=Party of European Socialists}}</ref> He was [[Party of European Socialists presidential primaries, 2014|unopposed]], as no other candidate stepped forward to challenge him in the race to be the socialist campaign figurehead.<ref>Laurens Cerulus (7 November 2013), [http://www.euractiv.com/eu-elections-2014/schulz-unopposed-socialist-front-news-531552 Schulz unopposed as socialist frontrunner for Commission presidency] ''[[EurActiv]]''.</ref> This kicked off a tour to all member states and particularly all member parties.

On 1 March 2014, Schulz accepted the nomination of the [[Party of European Socialists]] in Rome. He was elected by 368 PES members out of 404, with only 2 votes against him. Prior to the vote, in what was widely seen as a clear signal to its European partners on the left that there are limits to their support for the EU, Britain's [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] had publicly spoken out against Schulz as the left's candidate, instead favouring [[Helle Thorning-Schmidt]] of Denmark's [[Social Democrats (Denmark)|Social Democrats]]. Schulz launched his European campaign on 17 April in front of 1,600 socialist activists in Paris, promising to tackle taxes and social dumping.<ref>Cécile Barbière (18 April 2014), [http://www.euractiv.com/sections/eu-elections-2014/martin-schulz-launches-european-campaign-paris-301660 Martin Schulz launches European campaign in Paris] ''[[EurActiv]]''.</ref> He ran against Conservative [[Jean-Claude Juncker]], then [[List of Prime Ministers of Luxembourg|Prime Minister]] of Luxembourg, and Liberal [[Guy Verhofstadt]].

However, when the Socialists came second in the European election behind the centre-right European People's Party (EPP), Germany's [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democrats]] announced that they would accept one of [[Chancellor of Germany|Chancellor]] [[Angela Merkel]]'s conservatives taking the German post on the [[European Commission]] if Schulz remained president of the European Parliament.<ref>Stephen Brown, Holger Hansen and Michelle Martin (20 June 2014), [https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/06/20/eu-candidates-germany-idUSL6N0P138320140620 German SPD ready to cede EU top job if they keep parliament post] ''[[Reuters]]''.</ref> The decision to back Juncker for the Commission's presidency instead was later endorsed at an informal meeting in Paris of eight Social Democratic leaders, including Thorning-Schmidt, [[Sigmar Gabriel]] of Germany and [[Werner Faymann]] of Austria.<ref>Mark John and Elizabeth Pineau (21 June 2014), [https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/06/21/us-eu-juncker-idUSKBN0EW0GH20140621 European left-wingers back Juncker for EU Commission] ''[[Reuters]]''.</ref> Accordingly, Schulz did not join the European Commission but remained in his current position.

==Domestic politics==
Since 1999, Schulz has been part of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]] leadership under party chairmen [[Gerhard Schröder]] (1999–2004), [[Franz Müntefering]] (2004–05 and 2008–09), [[Matthias Platzeck]] (2005–06), [[Kurt Beck]] (2006–08) and [[Sigmar Gabriel]] (2009–17). Within the party, he serves as co-chairman of the Commission for International Politics, alongside [[Niels Annen]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Kommission Internationale Politik: Vorstand|url=http://www.spd.de/spd_organisationen/internationalepolitik/Kommission_Internationale_Politik/Vorstand/|website=SPD-Fraktion|access-date=12 June 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150626100019/http://www.spd.de/spd_organisationen/internationalepolitik/Kommission_Internationale_Politik/Vorstand/|archive-date=26 June 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Schulz was an SPD delegate to the [[Federal Convention (Germany)|Federal Convention]] for the purpose of electing the [[President of Germany]] in 2004, 2009, 2010 and 2012. In the negotiations to form a [[coalition government]] following the [[2013 German federal election|2013 federal elections]], he was part of the wider leadership circle chaired by [[Angela Merkel]], [[Horst Seehofer]] and [[Sigmar Gabriel]]. He also led the SPD delegation in the working group on European affairs; his co-chair of the CDU/CSU was fellow MEP [[Herbert Reul]].

During his 2014 campaign for the Presidency of the European Commission, Schulz established himself as a regular presence in German media on issues unconnected to the European Parliament elections that year.<ref>Toby Vogel (14 April 2014), [http://www.politico.eu/article/if-germany-changes-europe-changes/ If Germany changes, Europe changes] ''[[European Voice]]''.</ref> By 2015, German newspapers speculated that Schulz was interested in running for the chancellorship of Germany in the [[2017 German federal election|2017 federal elections]].<ref>Tara Palmeri (5 May 2015), [http://www.politico.eu/article/martin-schulz-president-for-life-2/ Martin Schulz: President-for-life?] ''[[Politico Europe]]''.</ref> In May 2016, he told weekly newspaper ''[[Welt am Sonntag]]'' that he would not enter the race to succeed Angela Merkel.<ref>Andrea Bonanni, Jurek Kuczkiewicz, Christoph B.

On 24 January 2017, Schulz was confirmed as the Social Democrats' candidate for chancellor.<ref name="sueddeutsche1">{{cite web|url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/eil-martin-schulz-wird-kanzlerkandidat-der-spd-1.3346814|title=Bundestagswahl: Martin Schulz wird Kanzlerkandidat der SPD|via=Sueddeutsche.de}}</ref>

===2017 federal election===

[[File:20170920 Martin Schulz in Gelsenkirchen 07.jpg|thumb|Schulz in [[Gelsenkirchen]], 20 September 2017]]
On 24 January 2017, Schulz became the Social Democrats' candidate for chancellor in that year's Federal election.<ref name="sueddeutsche1"/> In March he was unanimously chosen as official head of the party, the first time in post-war Germany a leader of the SPD received no dissenting vote.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/martin-schulz-mit-100-prozent-zum-parteichef-der-spd-gewaehlt-a-1139478.html|title=Schulz mit 100 Prozent zum SPD-Parteichef gewählt|date=2017-03-19|work=Spiegel Online|access-date=2018-03-05}}</ref> Following the announcement of his nomination, his party gained an average of ten percentage points in public opinion polls. For a short period of time the SPD was close to the Union parties of Chancellor Merkel, during this time political observers regarded it possible that Schulz could unseat Merkel in the federal election on 24 September 2017. Polls also showed Schulz leading Merkel if Germans could elect their chancellor directly.

With unemployment hitting new lows each month during the campaign, Schulz later struggled to gain traction with a message focusing on the ills of [[inequality in Germany]]. Shortly before the election, he refocused his campaign on the risk of a rekindled [[European migrant crisis]].<ref>Thomas Escritt (27 July 2017), [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-russia-economy-sanctions-idUSKBN1AC1K8 Economic euphoria propels Merkel towards fourth term] ''[[Reuters]]''</ref><ref>Isla Binnie (27 July 2017), [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-germany-election-schulz-idUSKBN1AC254 Schulz turns to immigration to revive flagging campaign] ''[[Reuters]]''</ref> In July 2017, illness forced Schulz's campaign manager and friend Markus Engels to step down.<ref>Guy Chazan (September 15, 2017) [https://www.ft.com/content/7a0c299e-99ed-11e7-b83c-9588e51488a0?mhq5j=e6 Knives out for Martin Schulz as SPD faces Germany poll defeat] ''[[Financial Times]]''.</ref>

===Aftermath of the 2017 federal election===
Within an hour of the first exit poll, Schulz confirmed statements by other senior party figures that the SPD would not renew its [[Grand coalition (Germany)|Grand coalition]] with the CDU under Angela Merkel but head into opposition.<ref>Jon Henley (September 24, 2017) [https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2017/sep/24/german-elections-2017-angela-merkel-cdu-spd-afd-live-updates German elections 2017: Angela Merkel wins fourth term but AfD makes gains – as it happened] ''[[The Guardian]]''.</ref> Schulz explicitly refused to serve in a Merkel government.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article169028979/Frage-zu-Merkel-bringt-Schulz-voellig-aus-dem-Konzept.html|title=Frage zu Merkel bringt Schulz völlig aus dem Konzept|date=2017-09-25|work=Die Welt|access-date=2018-03-05}}</ref>
However, after the attempt to form a "Jamaica coalition" between CDU/CSU, FDP and Greens failed in November 2017 and President [[Steinmeier]] asked him to reconsider, Schulz reverted his position and began coalition talks with the CDU/CSU parties.

In February 2018, these coalition talks concluded successfully and Schulz announced he would succeed incumbent Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel as Foreign minister. After heavy public and internal criticism, Schulz stepped down as SPD Leader on 13 February 2018 and proposed [[Andrea Nahles]] as his replacement; and shortly thereafter he also gave up his attempt to become Foreign minister. The attempt to install Nahles as acting party leader faced severe criticism from several regional party associations as well as experts in constitutional law.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.zeit.de/news/2018-02/13/nahles-und-die-kommissarische-spd-fuehrung-180213-99-55434|title=Nahles und die kommissarische SPD-Führung|date=2018-02-13|work=Die Zeit|access-date=2018-03-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180322080606/http://www.zeit.de/news/2018-02/13/nahles-und-die-kommissarische-spd-fuehrung-180213-99-55434|archive-date=22 March 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref> The party executive nominated Nahles as the new leader, with [[Olaf Scholz]], as the longest-serving deputy, taking over as acting party leader until the party conference on 22 April 2018.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/spd-martin-schulz-tritt-als-chef-ab-andrea-nahles-soll-uebernehmen-olaf-scholz-uebernimmt-kommissarisch-a-1193348.html|title=SPD-Vorsitz: Schulz schlägt Nahles als Nachfolgerin vor, kommissarisch soll Scholz übernehmen|date=2018-02-13|work=Spiegel Online|access-date=2018-02-13}}</ref>

Schulz is widely considered an ardent EU supporter.<ref>Matthew Dalton (1 July 2014), [https://www.wsj.com/articles/german-socialist-martin-schulz-elected-president-of-european-parliament-1404216532 German Socialist Martin Schulz Re-Elected as European Parliament President] ''[[Wall Street Journal]]''.</ref> He has hailed European unification as being civilization's greatest achievement over the past century.<ref name="auto" /> In 2014, however, he argued it was also essential that responsibility was delegated away from Brussels and down to national, regional and local authorities, allowing the EU to focus on the big issues.<ref>Luke Baker, Robin Emmott and John O'Donnell (20 February 2014), [https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/02/20/us-eu-schulz-idUSBREA1J1LY20140220 Germany's Schulz details plans for EU Commission presidency bid] ''[[Reuters]]''.</ref> As a result of Schulz's [[pro-Europeanism]], both supporters and detractors have linked him with the slogan "MEGA" – "Make Europe Great Again" – as a parody of US President [[Donald Trump]]'s "[[Make America Great Again]]".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dw.com/en/finance-minister-sch%C3%A4uble-slams-schulz-fans-for-make-europe-great-again-slogan/a-37500808|title=Finance Minister Schäuble slams Schulz fans for 'Make Europe Great Again' slogan|date=10 February 2017|access-date=13 February 2017|publisher=Deutsche Welle}}</ref>

Schulz is committed to strengthening Europe and the European institutions. In 2016, he presented a ten-point plan for a reform of the EU with Vice Chancellor [[Sigmar Gabriel]]. It calls for a "streamlining" of European structures and the establishment of a strong European government under the control of the European Parliament.<ref name="zeit-juli-2016">[http://www.zeit.de/news/2016-07/02/parteien-spd-diskutiert-ueber-europa-nach-dem-brexit-votum-02084007 ''Parteien: Gabriel: Brexit kann Chance für Europa sein.''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160724084835/http://www.zeit.de/news/2016-07/02/parteien-spd-diskutiert-ueber-europa-nach-dem-brexit-votum-02084007 |date=24 July 2016 }} In: ''[[Die Zeit]].'' 2. Juli 2016 ([[Deutsche Presse-Agentur|DPA]]-Meldung).</ref>

Schulz has often emphasised that the European Union is the best way to banish the "demons of the twentieth century", such as racism, xenophobia and antisemitism.<ref>{{cite web|title=Schulz: Verbannt geglaubte Dämonen kehren zurück|periodical=[[EurActiv]]|url=http://www.euractiv.de/section/wahlen-und-macht/news/schulz-verbannt-geglaubte-damonen-kehren-zuruck/|access-date=9 February 2017|date=20 March 2012|language=de}}</ref> The ''Jerusalem Post'' criticised his words on antisemitism as "meaningless condemnations".<ref>{{Cite web |last=Gerstenfeld |first=Manfred |title=European Parliament: More words replace an anti-Semitism task force |work=[[The Jerusalem Post]] |access-date=9 February 2017 |date=30 December 2014 |url=http://www.jpost.com/Opinion/European-Parliament-More-words-replace-an-anti-Semitism-task-force-386199}}</ref>

After the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union in a [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|membership referendum]], Schulz warned in mid-2016: "If we break the instruments with which we banish the demons, we will set them free again."<ref name="zeit-juli-2016" /> He is one of the 27 initiators of the Charter of Digital Fundamental Rights published in November 2016 Of the European Union.<ref>digitalcharta.eu: [https://digitalcharta.eu/intiatorinnen-und-initiatoren/ Liste der Initiatoren]</ref>

In December 2017, Schulz called for a new constitutional treaty for a "[[United States of Europe]]".<ref name=Schulz>[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/07/martin-schulz-united-states-of-europe-germany-sdp  Martin Schulz wants 'United States of Europe' within eight years] - [[The Guardian]], 7 December 2017</ref>  He proposed that this constitution should be written by "a convention that includes civil society and the people" and that any state that declined to accept this proposed constitution should have to leave the bloc.<ref name=Schulz /> His proposal is "likely to be met with some resistance from [[Angela Merkel|Merkel]] and other EU leaders".<ref name=Schulz />

===Security policy===
In front of the [[European Council]] on 19 December 2013, Schulz took responsibility for the initiation of the Cox-Kwaśniewski mission to Ukraine.<ref name=spbysc>{{cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/the-president/en/press/press_release_speeches/speeches/sp-2013/sp-2013-december/html/address-to-the-european-council-by-the-president-of-the-european-parliament-martin-schulz|title="Address to the European Council by the President of the European Parliament Martin Schulz" 19 Dec 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140412075119/http://www.europarl.europa.eu/the-president/en/press/press_release_speeches/speeches/sp-2013/sp-2013-december/html/address-to-the-european-council-by-the-president-of-the-european-parliament-martin-schulz|archive-date=12 April 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref> In the same speech, he noted that Europe was still militarily dependent on the US, and that in many cases Europe would be quite incapable of carrying out a military operation without the support of the USA.

Schulz was quoted in a newspaper report of his speech as having said: "If we wish to defend our values and interests, if we wish to maintain the security of our citizens, then a majority of MEPs consider that we need a headquarters for civil and military missions in Brussels and deployable troops,"<ref name=water>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/eu/10528852/David-Cameron-flies-to-Brussels-determined-to-fight-EU-drones-programme.html|title=David Cameron fights off EU army plan|date=19 December 2013|last1=Waterfield|first1=Bruno}}</ref> The [[External Action Service]] of [[High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy|HRUFASP]] [[Catherine Ashton]] had prepared a proposal, which was supported by France, Spain, Italy, Poland and Germany who together have [[Qualified majority voting|QMV]] majority, to create a European Air Force composed of surveillance drones, heavy transport airplanes, and air-to-air refuelling planes.<ref name=water/> The debate was joined with a view presented by [[NATO]] Secretary General [[Anders Fogh Rasmussen]], who maintained that "Nato will remain the bedrock of Euro-Atlantic security."<ref name=water/> Rasmussen's view prevailed on the Council at this time because QMV does not take effect in decisions of the European Council until 1 November 2014.

===Economy===
Schulz believes that dignified work is a value in itself. For that reason, he says, he is not a proponent of the concept of [[unconditional basic income]]. However, Schulz is much in favour of decent wage agreements, secure and lasting jobs, employee participation in decision-making and the examination of the social justification for claims and payments.<ref>[http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/interview-with-german-chancellor-candidate-martin-schulz-a-1133475.html SPIEGEL Interview with Martin Schulz] 8 February 2017</ref>

===Foreign affairs===
In an effort to improve relations between Europe and [[Cuba]], Schulz led a European Parliament delegation to [[Havana]] for talks with [[Carlos Lage Dávila]] on lifting EU sanction against the countries in 2008.<ref>Ralf Beste (14 February 2008), [http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/brussels-man-in-havana-eu-seeks-deal-with-cuba-a-535227.html Brussels' Man in Havana: EU Seeks Deal with Cuba] ''[[Spiegel Online]]''.</ref>

In 2014, Schulz delivered a speech to the Israeli [[Knesset]], in which he criticised Israel for denying Palestinians a fair share of water resources in the occupied [[West Bank]]. The speech sparked a walk-out by several lawmakers from the far-right [[The Jewish Home|Jewish Home]] party, and drew a public rebuke from Prime Minister [[Benjamin Netanyahu]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Harsh reaction to Knesset speech surprises EU leader|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/harsh-reaction-to-knesset-speech-surprises-eu-leader/|website=The Times of Israel|access-date=26 January 2016|last=Ahren|first=Raphael|date=13 February 2014}}<br/>Alistair Lyon (14 February 2014), [https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2014/02/12/world/middleeast/12reuters-palestinians-israel-european.html Euro Parliament Chief Creates Waves in Israel] ''[[New York Times]]''.</ref>

In 2015, amid the [[Ukrainian crisis]], Schulz suspended a committee made up of Russian and EU lawmakers that meets several times a year to improve ties.<ref>[http://www.euractiv.com/sections/europes-east/european-parliament-retaliates-over-russia-entry-ban-315080 European Parliament retaliates over Russia entry ban] ''[[EurActiv]]'', 3 June 2015.</ref> When Russia barred entry to two politicians from the EU who had planned to attend the funeral in 2015 of murdered opposition figure [[Boris Nemtsov]], Schulz criticised the barring as "a high affront to EU–Russia relations and the work of democratic institutions".<ref>Christian Lowe and Alastair Macdonald (3 March 2015), [https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/03/03/us-russia-nemtsov-foreigners-idUSKBN0LZ1GL20150303 Russia bars two EU politicians from Nemtsov funeral] ''[[Reuters]]''.</ref>

In 2016, Schulz stated that [[Donald Trump]] is a problem "for the whole world," and linked the Trump phenomenon to [[far-right]] populism in Europe. He called Trump an "irresponsible man" who "boasts about not having a clue".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/09/16/trump-is-a-problem-for-the-whole-world-says-top-e-u-politician/|title='Trump is a problem for the whole world,' says top EU politician}}</ref>

==Controversy==

===Berlusconi incident===

On 2 July 2003, one day after Italy taking over the rotating [[Presidency of the Council of the European Union|Presidency of the Council of the EU]], Schulz criticized Prime Minister [[Silvio Berlusconi]] of Italy of his [[domestic policy]]. Berlusconi replied:
{{quote|''Signor Schulz, so che in Italia c'è un produttore che sta montando un film sui campi di concentramento nazisti: la suggerirò per il ruolo di kapò. Lei è perfetto!''
In English: Mister Schulz, I know of a film-producer in Italy who is making a film about Nazi concentration-camps. I will recommend you for the part of a [[Kapo (concentration camp)|Kapo]] [concentration-camp inmate appointed as supervisor]. You are perfect!}}
Berlusconi later claimed he was referring to the comedy-series ''[[Hogan's Heroes]]'', where a slow-witted character named Sgt. Hans Georg Schultz, played by [[John Banner]], starred.  Even though Berlusconi insisted that he was just being ironic,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.repubblica.it/online/esteri/semestredue/litigio/litigio.html|title=La Repubblica/esteri: Il duello verbale Schulz-Berlusconi}}</ref> his comparisons with the Nazis caused a brief diplomatic rift between the two.

===Incident with Godfrey Bloom===
On 24 November 2010 the British MEP [[Godfrey Bloom]] caused a row in the European Parliament when he interrupted a speech by Martin Schulz, heckling him with the Nazi propaganda slogan [[Führer#Ein Volk, ein Reich, ein Führer|Ein Volk, ein Reich, ein Führer]] ('one people, one empire, one leader') and accusing him of being an 'undemocratic fascist'. Bloom later stated that he was referring to the fact that the indoctrination of the German people under the Nazi regime has long-lasting effects; "some Germans still find it difficult to accept diversity in Europe and differences of opinion". In the debate on the future of the [[Stability and Growth Pact|Euro Stability Pact]] Schulz had criticised the role played by the United Kingdom, which was involved in the discussions despite not being a member of the eurozone, and said that some eurosceptics would take pleasure in the collapse of the European Union. Following the incident, the President of Parliament, [[Jerzy Buzek]], excluded Bloom from the Chamber.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/politik/ausland/0,1518,730906,00.html|access-date=30 January 2012|title=Uproar in the European Parliament Briton attacked SPD members with Nazi slogan }}</ref> The Dutch MEP [[Barry Madlener]], from the right-wing populist [[Partij voor de Vrijheid]] (PVV – Freedom Party), then protested against that decision, on the grounds that Schulz himself had recently described the PVV MEP [[Daniël van der Stoep]] as a fascist, but had not been excluded from the Chamber.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elsevier.nl/web/Nieuws/Europese-Unie/282157/Europarlementarier-uit-debat-gezet-na-naziuitspraak.htm|access-date=30 January 2012|title=MEP put off debate after Nazi rule }}</ref>

===Campaign-related issues===
Schulz received criticism after having transformed the Twitter account that his staff had built up for his European Parliament presidency into his own personal account in order to use it as part of his candidature to the EU Commission.<ref name="euobserver.com">{{cite web|url=http://euobserver.com/institutional/123732|title=EU parliament chief censors report criticising his actions}}</ref>

During his time as President of the European Parliament, Schulz removed a paragraph critical of his stewardship in a key committee report set for debate on 2 April 2014, thereby attracting a lot of negative attention.<ref name="euobserver.com"/> As a consequence, a large majority of the European Parliament voted on 4 April 2014 to invite Schulz to resign so that he would be able to campaign for the European elections.<ref>[http://www.euractiv.com/sections/eu-elections-2014/meps-cry-foul-schulz-stunt-avoid-resignation-301371 MEPs cry foul at Schulz’ stunt to avoid resignation] ''[[EurActiv]]'', April 2014.</ref><ref>[http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?type=TA&language=EN&reference=P7-TA-2014-0428 "The President's political activities"], in European Parliament resolution of 16 April 2014 with observations forming an integral part of its Decision (1) on discharge in respect of the implementation of the general budget of the European Union for the financial year 2012, Section I – European Parliament (COM(2013)0570 – C7-0274/2013 – 2013/2196(DEC)), 16 April 2014.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/oeil/popups/ficheprocedure.do?lang=en&reference=2013/2196(DEC)|title=Procedure File: 2013/2196(DEC) – 2012 discharge: EU general budget | work = Legislative Observatory |publisher= European Parliament}}</ref>

Lastly, Schulz was criticized about the tax-free daily allowance of €304 the President of the Parliament received, until 18 April 2014, which he received while he was campaigning to become President of the commission. This was paid for 365 days a year, in addition to his salary of 200 thousand [[euro]]s per year. A member of parliament receives this daily allowance only for attending.<ref>[https://www.welt.de/debatte/henryk-m-broder/article127902587/Ueppiges-Tagegeld-stellt-Schulz-Versprechen-infrage.html Üppiges Tagegeld stellt Schulz' Versprechen infrage], Die Welt, 12 May 2014.</ref><ref>[http://www.swr.de/report/presse/eu-tagegeld/-/id=1197424/did=13302262/nid=1197424/gc8skf/index.html Parlamentspräsident Martin Schulz erhielt an 365 Tagen pro Jahr Tagegelder des EU-Parlaments], SWR, 29 April 2014.</ref><ref>[http://www.swr.de/report/ueppige-pauschalen-die-fragwuerdigen-tagegelder-von-eu-parlamentariern/-/id=233454/did=13081536/nid=233454/3ogy9l/index.html Die fragwürdigen Tagegelder von EU-Parlamentariern], Report Mainz, 5 May 2014.</ref>

=== Allegation of favoring close employees ===
In April 2017, the European Parliament, as part of its decision to discharge the financial year 2015, criticized two personnel matters where Schulz had been responsible for as President of Parliament. An employee of the parliament received an [[expatriate|expatriation allowance]] of around 20,000 euros, even though his center of life had previously been in Berlin. The employee was a confidant of Schulz and later worked for the SPD as its campaign manager. Schulz was also accused of signing irregular promotions of close associates in a presidential decree that would have secured them financially advantageous posts beyond his departure. Schulz described the complaint as an election maneuver by "anti-Europeans, conservatives and Greens" and referred a decision of the [[European Anti-Fraud Office]] not to initiate an official investigation.<ref>European Parliament: [http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?type=TA&reference=P8-TA-2017-0146&language=DE&ring=A8-2017-0153 Discharge 2015: EU general budget - European Parliament, Section I (2016/2152 DEC)], Decision of 27 April 2017</ref><ref>[http://www.sueddeutsche.de/1.3481630 "Europäisches Parlament rügt Schulz wegen Personalentscheidungen"], ''Süddeutsche Zeitung'', 27.

April 2017.</ref>

=== Foreign Minister debate ===
On the day of the [[2017 German federal election|2017 Federal Election]], Schulz said he would under no circumstances become a minister of a government led by [[Angela Merkel]] or negotiate to form a [[Grand Coalition (Germany)|Grand Coalition]]. After the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]] and [[CDU/CSU|Union parties]] finished their coalition talks on 6 February 2018, he made his intentions clear that he wanted to be [[Federal Foreign Office|Foreign Minister]] in the next government. This was met by heavy criticism from the party base, as Schulz was abandoning his word for a second time—the first being his vow not to enter coalition talks with Angela Merkel. The harshest criticism came from the incumbent Foreign Minister and his predecessor as SPD leader, [[Sigmar Gabriel]]. He accused Schulz and the Party leadership of not showing him the respect he deserves and being rude towards him. This public attack, coupled with internal pressure from the party leadership, led Schulz to retract prior statements and on 9 February 2018 he released a statement saying he would not enter into the new government;<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=313AuNCV_Rw Betrunken?

==Personal life==
Schulz is married and has two children, Nico and Lina.<ref name="fttheveteranmep"/><ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.mz-web.de/politik/martin-schulz-was-sie-ueber-den-spd-kanzlerkandidaten-wissen-sollten-25642976 | title=Martin Schulz: Was Sie über den SPD-Politiker wissen sollten| date=25 September 2017}}</ref> He was raised [[Roman Catholic]] and is a [[lapsed Catholic]].<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/erasmus/2016/05/eu-and-religious-freedom
