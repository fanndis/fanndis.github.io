'''''Exploring the Reef with Jean-Michel Cousteau''''' (also simply referred to as '''''Exploring the Reef''''') is a [[live action]]/[[Computer Animation|computer animated]] [[Short film|short]] [[documentary film]] included on the [[fullscreen (filmmaking)|fullscreen]] version of [[Disk storage|Disc]] 2 of the ''[[Finding Nemo]]'' 2-Disc [[Special Edition#Collector's Edition|Collector's Edition]] [[DVD]].<ref>[http://disneydvd.disney.go.com/finding-nemo.html Finding Nemo | Now On DVD & Movie Download | Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091009201824/http://disneydvd.disney.go.com/finding-nemo.html |date=2009-10-09 }}</ref> It features [[Jean-Michel Cousteau]] in a documentary film he is trying to make about coral reefs, but [[Finding Nemo#Cast and characters|Marlin, Dory]] and [[Nemo (Finding Nemo)|Nemo]] keep interrupting him.

==Plot==
Cousteau is narrating about the ocean. As he starts talking about [[coral reef]]s, Dory starts bothering him by entering the frame. The scene then cuts to an [[anemone]] that Nemo and Marlin come out of and Cousteau sighs for not being able to do his documentary. The scene cuts to real [[cuttlefish]]es, which Dory tries to speak to. When Cousteau tells Dory to stop it, the scene cuts to a live [[Spanish dancer]]. This makes Marlin think of dancing and soon all three animated fish are dancing to some music. This infuriates Cousteau so much that he yells "Stop!" and proceeds to make a quick rant about the [[water cycle]], concluding that "Everyone, everywhere, affects the ocean!". Dory expresses amazement and at first, Cousteau is satisfied, but when it is revealed that she was listening to the [[Echo (phenomenon)|echo]] inside a [[conch]] shell, Cousteau loses his temper and starts ranting in [[French language|French]]. For about six seconds, a [[cartoon]] still image of Cousteau shrugging in a [[swimming suit]] appears while [[Elevator music|Musak]]-style [[music]] plays on a title card which reads "Please Stand By".

When Cousteau comes back, however, he has calmed down and talks with the three fish about [[coral]] that have suffered from [[coral bleaching]], while the whitened coral appears on screen. The next topic is [[Coral#Reproduction|coral reproduction]]. Dory frantically swims to every new egg to say "Happy Birthday", Marlin paternally covers Nemo's eyes and Cousteau talks about how there are so many eggs, that even the hungriest fish cannot possibly eat all of them. He concludes by talking all about how we must all work hard in order to preserve the beauty of the [[coral reef]]. Suddenly, Nemo and the other two fish interrupt him, inadvertently summarizing the message of the entire film during their arguing. Jean-Michel gets mad again and the camera cuts to him aboard his boat by night. Humiliated that he has been "up-staged by fish", Cousteau mutters that "this would have never happened to [[Jacques Cousteau|Papa]]." In a before-credits scene, Nemo tells the viewer about Jean-Michel Cousteau's website: ''oceanfutures.org''.<ref name="YouTube">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uy-fi0RvqMA|title=Exploring the Reef with Jean-Michel Cousteau|publisher=}}</ref>
