{{Politics of Syrian Opposition}}

The '''Syrian opposition''' ({{lang-ar|المعارضة السورية}} ''{{transl|ar|al-Muʻaraḍatu s-Sūrīyah}}'', {{IPA-ar|almʊˈʕaːɾadˤɑtu s.suːˈɾɪj.ja|}}) is the political structure represented by the [[Syrian National Coalition]] and associated Syrian anti-government groups with certain territorial control as an [[Syrian Interim Government|alternative Syrian government]].

The Syrian opposition evolved since the beginning of the Syrian conflict from groups calling for the overthrow of the Assad government in [[Syria]] and who have opposed its [[Council of Ministers (Syria)|Ba'athist government]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/10338256|title=Bashar al-Assad: Facing down rebellion|date=2018-09-03|work=BBC News|access-date=2020-01-29|language=en-GB}}</ref> Prior to the [[Syrian Civil War]], the term "opposition" ({{lang-ar|المعارضة }}) had been used to refer to traditional political actors, for example the [[National Coordination Committee for Democratic Change]]; that is, groups and individuals who have had a history of dissidence against the Syrian state.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://carnegie-mec.org/2013/04/03/syrian-opposition-s-leadership-problem-pub-51373|title=The Syrian Opposition's Leadership Problem|last=Sayigh|first=Yezid|website=Carnegie Middle East Center|language=en|access-date=2020-01-29}}</ref>

The first opposition structures to form in the [[Civil uprising phase of the Syrian Civil War|Syrian uprising]] were local protest-organizing committees. These formed in April 2011, as protesters graduated from spontaneous protests to protests organized by meetings beforehand.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-13168276|title=Syria's spontaneously organised protests|last=Ghattas|first=Kim|date=2011-04-22|work=BBC News|access-date=2020-01-29|language=en-GB}}</ref>

The [[Civil uprising phase of the Syrian Civil War|Syrian uprising phase]], from March 2011 until the start of August 2011, was characterized by a consensus for nonviolent struggle among the uprising's participants.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/how-syrian-revolution-became-militarized/|title=How the Syrian Revolution Became Militarized|last=Kouddous|first=Sharif Abdel|journal=The Nation|date=2012-08-23|access-date=2020-01-29|language=en-US|issn=0027-8378}}</ref> Thus the conflict could not have been yet characterized as a "civil war", until army units defected in response to government reprisals against the protest movement<ref>{{Cite web|title=Asad's Armed Opposition: The Free Syrian Army|url=https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/view/asads-armed-opposition-the-free-syrian-army|access-date=2020-09-19|website=www.washingtoninstitute.org|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|date=2011-11-11|title=We Live as in War|url=https://www.hrw.org/report/2011/11/11/we-live-war/crackdown-protesters-governorate-homs-syria|access-date=2020-09-19|website=Human Rights Watch|language=en}}</ref>.This occurred 2012, allowing the conflict to meet the definition of "civil war."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/event/Syrian-Civil-War|title=Syrian Civil War {{!}} Facts & Timeline|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|access-date=2020-01-29}}</ref>

A broader opposition umbrella group, the [[National Coalition for Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces]], was formed in November 2012 and has gained recognition as the "legitimate representative of the Syrian people" by the [[Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf]] (CCASG) and as a "representative of aspirations of Syrian people" by the [[Arab League]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Syria's newly-formed opposition coalition draws mixed reaction|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/world/2012-11/13/c_131970585.htm|accessdate=25 January 2013|newspaper=Xinhua|date=13 November 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121116024459/http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/world/2012-11/13/c_131970585.htm|archive-date=16 November 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> The Syrian National Coalition was subsequently considered to take the seat of Syria in the Arab League, with the Syrian government representative suspended that year.

==Background==
Syria has been an independent republic since 1946 after the expulsion of the [[French Third Republic|French forces]]. For decades, the country was partially stable with a series of coups until the [[Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party – Syria Region|Ba'ath Party]] seized power in Syria in 1963 after a [[1963 Syrian coup d'état|''coup d'état'']]. The head of state since 1971 has been a member of the [[al-Assad family]], beginning with [[Hafez al-Assad]] (1971{{ndash}}2000). Syria was under [[State of emergency|emergency law]] from the time of the 1963 Syrian coup d'état until 21 April 2011, when it was rescinded by [[Bashar al-Assad]], Hafez's eldest surviving son and the current [[President of Syria]].<ref>[http://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/insidestory/2011/04/201141811610800805.html Syria's state of emergency] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130524170237/http://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/insidestory/2011/04/201141811610800805.html |date=24 May 2013 }}, [[Al Jazeera]], 17 April 2011.</ref> As the [[revolutionary wave]] commonly referred to as the [[Arab Spring]] began to take shape in early 2011, Syrian protesters began consolidating opposition councils.

==History==
The [[Istanbul Meeting for Syria]], the first convention of the Syrian opposition, took place on 26 April 2011, during the [[Civil uprising phase of the Syrian Civil War|Syrian civil uprising]]. There followed the [[Antalya Conference for Change in Syria]] or ''Antalya Opposition Conference'', a three-day [[convention (meeting)|conference]] of representatives of the Syrian opposition held from 31 May until 3 June 2011 in [[Antalya]], Turkey.

Organized by [[Ammar al-Qurabi]]'s ''National Organization for Human Rights in Syria'' and financed by the wealthy Damascene Sanqar family, it led to a final statement refusing compromise or reform solutions, and to the election of a 31-member leadership.

After the Antalya conference, a follow-up meeting took place two days later in [[Brussels]], then another gathering in Paris that was addressed by [[Bernard Henri Levy]].<ref name=Aita302f>{{cite book |author= [[Samir Aita]] |chapter= Syria |chapterurl= {{Google book|uildCgAAQBAJ |page= 302|plainurl= y}} |editor= [[I.

==Political groups==
The Syrian opposition does not have a definitive political structure. In December 2015, members of the Syrian opposition convened in [[Riyadh]], Saudi Arabia: 34 groups attended the convention, which aimed to produce a unified delegation for negotiations with the Syrian government.<ref name=bbc08122015>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-35035232 |title=Syrian opposition seeks unified front at Riyadh conference |date=8 December 2015 |website=bbc.com |access-date= 22 June 2018|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20181219185337/https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-35035232|archive-date= 19 December 2018|url-status= live}}</ref> Notable groups present included:

* the [[National Coordination Committee for Democratic Change]], which called for negotiations on a peaceful transition
* armed groups:
** [[Jaysh al-Islam]]
** [[Ahrar al-Sham]]
** the [[Southern Front of the Free Syrian Army|Southern Front]]

The [[National Coalition for Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces]] is a coalition of opposition groups and individuals, mostly exilic, who support the Syrian revolution side and oppose the Assad government ruling Syria. It formed on 11 November 2012 at a conference of opposition groups and individuals held in [[Doha]], [[Qatar]]. It has relations with other opposition organizations such as the Syrian National Council, the previous iteration of an exilic political body attempting to represent the grassroots movement; the union of the two was planned,{{by whom|date=February 2019}} but has failed to realize. Moderate Islamic preacher [[Moaz al-Khatib]], who had protested on the Syrian street in the early nonviolent phase of the uprising, served a term as the president of the coalition, but soon resigned his post, frustrated with the gap between the body and the grassroots of the uprising inside Syria.<ref>{{cite web |last= Kahf |first= Mohja |url= http://forusa.org/blogs/mohja-kahf/lack-us-peace-movement-solidarity-syrian-uprising-no-good-guys-excuse/12622 |archive-url= https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20140422221645/http://forusa.org/blogs/mohja-kahf/lack-us-peace-movement-solidarity-syrian-uprising-no-good-guys-excuse/12622 |url-status= dead |archive-date= 22 April 2014 |title= Lack of U.S. Peace Movement Solidarity with Syrian Uprising and the "No Good Guys Excuse" &#124; Fellowship of Reconciliation |publisher= Forusa.org |access-date= 21 January 2014 }}</ref> [[Riad Seif]] and [[Suheir Atassi]], both of whom had also protested on the street in Syria early in the uprising, were elected as vice presidents.

===Syrian Democratic Council===
{{main|Syrian Democratic Council}}
The Syrian Democratic Council was established on 10 December 2015 in [[al-Malikiyah]]. It was co-founded by prominent human rights activist [[Haytham Manna]] and was intended as the political wing of the [[Syrian Democratic Forces]]. The council includes more than a dozen blocs and coalitions that support [[federalism]] in Syria, including the [[Movement for a Democratic Society]], the [[Kurdish National Alliance in Syria]], the [[Law–Citizenship–Rights Movement]], and since September 2016 the [[Syria's Tomorrow Movement]]. The last group is led by former National Coalition president and Syrian National Council [[Ahmad Jarba]]. In August 2016 the SDC opened a public office in [[al-Hasakah]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.hawarnews.com/inauguration-of-the-1st-msd-office/|title=Inauguration of the 1st MSD office|publisher=[[Hawar News Agency]]|date=1 August 2016|access-date=3 August 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160804030218/http://en.hawarnews.com/inauguration-of-the-1st-msd-office/|archive-date=4 August 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The Syrian Democratic Council was invited to participate in the international [[Geneva peace talks on Syria (2016)|Geneva III peace talks on Syria]] in March 2016. However, it rejected the invitations because no representatives of the [[Movement for a Democratic Society]], led by the [[Democratic Union Party (Syria)|Democratic Union Party]], were invited.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

==Territorial control==

{{Syrian Civil War map}}
Various Syrian opposition groups have at least some presence in seven Syrian governorates, though none is fully under the control of the entity. Governorates with partial opposition control include:

*[[Idlib Governorate]] - 
*[[Hama Governorate]] - Limited Control on Northern areas next to Idlib.
*[[Aleppo Governorate]]

Governorates under partial control of opposition groups aligned with the Syrian Democratic Council:
*[[Hasakah Governorate]]
*[[Raqqa Governorate]]
*[[Aleppo Governorate]]
*[[Deir ez-Zor Governorate]]

===Turkish-Controlled territories and territories controlled by the Syrian Interim Government===
In April 2015, after the [[Second Battle of Idlib]], the interim seat of the Syrian Interim Government was proposed to be Idlib, in the Idlib Governorate. However, this move was rejected by the [[al-Nusra Front]] and [[Ahrar al-Sham]]-led [[Army of Conquest]], which between them controlled Idlib.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/politics/2015/04/syria-opposition-idlib-nusra-government-in-exile.html|title=Will Syrian opposition move interim government to Idlib? – Al-Monitor: the Pulse of the Middle East|work=Al-Monitor|date=7 April 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161226065604/http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/politics/2015/04/syria-opposition-idlib-nusra-government-in-exile.html|archive-date=26 December 2016}}</ref> According to the Syrian National Coalition, in 2017 there were 404 opposition-aligned local councils operating in villages, towns, and cities controlled by rebel forces.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2017/02/russia-syria-value-local-councils-shift-damascus.html|title=Why Moscow now sees value in Syrian local councils|work=Al-Monitor: the Pulse of the Middle East|author=Anton Mardasov|date=20 February 2017|access-date=21 February 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170222053228/http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2017/02/russia-syria-value-local-councils-shift-damascus.html|archive-date=22 February 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> In 2016, the Syrian Interim Government became established within the [[Turkish Control of Northern Syria|Turkish Controlled areas]].

The Salvation Government extends authority mostly in the Idlib Governorate.

==Recognition and foreign relations==
{{main|Foreign relations of the Syrian Opposition|International recognition of the Syrian National Council}}
The [[foreign relations of the Syrian Opposition]] refers to the external relations of the self-proclaimed oppositional Syrian Arab Republic, which sees itself as the genuine Syria. The region of control of Syrian opposition affiliated groups is not well defined. The Turkish government recognizes Syrian opposition as the genuine Syrian Arab Republic and hosts several of its institutions on its territory. The seat of Syria in the Arab League is reserved for the Syrian opposition since 2014, but not populated.

The opposition as a whole is characterised as "terrorist" by [[Iran]],<ref>https://ctc.usma.edu/irans-unwavering-support-to-assads-syria/</ref> [[Russia]]<ref>https://english.alaraby.co.uk/english/news/2015/11/10/world-powers-drawing-up-syrian-rebel-terrorist-red-list</ref> and Syria.<ref>https://www.refworld.org/docid/5bcf1f6dc.html</ref>


==Military forces==
{{main|Syrian Revolutionary Command Council}}
Initially, the [[Free Syrian Army]] was perceived as the ultimate military force of the Syrian Opposition, but with the collapse of many FSA factions and emergence of powerful Islamist groups, it became clear to the opposition that only a cooperation of secular military forces and moderate Islamists could form a sufficient coalition to battle both the Syrian Government forces and radical Jihadists such as ISIL and in some cases al-Nusra Front.

In 2014, the military forces associated with the Syrian Opposition were defined by the [[Syrian Revolutionary Command Council]], which in turn was mainly relying on the [[Free Syrian Army]] (with links to [[Syrian National Coalition]]) and the [[Islamic Front (Syria)]]. Members of the Syrian Revolutionary Command Council:
