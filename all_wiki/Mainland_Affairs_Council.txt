The '''Mainland Affairs Council''' ('''MAC''') is a [[Cabinet (government)|cabinet]]-level administrative agency under the [[Executive Yuan]] of the [[Republic of China]] in Taiwan.

The MAC is responsible for the planning, development, and implementation of the [[cross-strait relations]] policy which targets [[mainland China]], [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]].<ref name=tail>{{cite book |last=Chi |first=Su |title=Taiwan's relations with Mainland China |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hdTMuHG2hXcC&q=mainland+affairs+council&pg=PA88 |accessdate=August 28, 2017 |language= |year=2009 |publisher=Routledge |location=London and New York |isbn=978-0-415-46454-3 |chapter=Conciliation in cross-strait relations |pages=4 }}</ref>

The MAC's counterpart body in the [[People's Republic of China]] is the [[Taiwan Affairs Office]]. Both states officially claim each other's territory, however the Republic of China controls only Taiwan and surrounding islands, and therefore is usually known as "Taiwan", sometimes referred to as the "[[Free area of the Republic of China|Free Area]]" of the Republic of China by the [[Constitution of the Republic of China]]. The People's Republic of China controls [[mainland China]] as well as [[Hong Kong]], [[Macau]], [[Hainan]], and other islands and is therefore usually known simply as "[[China]]". Therefore, the affairs related to the PRC belongs to the MAC, not the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Taiwan)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]].

The Mainland Affairs Council is administered by a [[Executive Yuan|cabinet level]] Minister. The current Minister is [[Chen Ming-tong]].

The council plays an important role in setting policy and development of [[cross-strait relations]] and advising the central government.<ref name=tail /> The agency funds and indirectly administers the [[Straits Exchange Foundation]] which is the official intermediary with the PRC.

==History==
In November 1987, relations between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait have improved considerably after [[Government of the Republic of China|ROC government]] began to allow family-related visits to Mainland China. The [[Executive Yuan]] therefore established the '''Inter-Agency Mainland Affairs Committee''' in August 1988 as a taskforce to handle mainland-related affairs among the authorities. In April 1990, the ROC government drafted the Organization Act for the Mainland Affairs Council to strengthen Mainland China policy making and to enhance policy making efficiency. The third reading of the act was passed by the [[Legislative Yuan]] on 18 January 1991. On 28 January 1991, the act was promulgated by [[President of the Republic of China|President]] [[Lee Teng-hui]] thus officially authorized the '''Mainland Affairs Council''' to be the agency for the overall planning and handling of affairs towards Mainland China.<ref name="autogenerated1"/><ref name=tail /> In 2017, some of the responsibilities of the [[Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission]] (MTAC) were absorbed into the MAC's Department of Hong Kong and Macao Affairs, creating the expanded Department of Hong Kong, Macao, Inner Mongolia, and Tibet Affairs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.scmp.com/news/china/policies-politics/article/2106907/taiwan-calls-time-mongolia-and-tibet-affairs-commission|title=Taiwan calls time on Mongolia and Tibet affairs commission|date=2017-08-16|website=South China Morning Post|language=en|access-date=2020-04-26}}</ref>
