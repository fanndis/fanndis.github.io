==Classification==
Dyslexia is divided into developmental and acquired forms. This article is primarily about ''developmental dyslexia'', i.e., dyslexia that begins in early childhood.<ref>Oxford English Dictionary. 3rd ed. "[https://oed.com/view/Entry/331223 dyslexia, ''n'']. Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press, 2012 ("a learning disability specifically affecting the attainment of literacy, with difficulty esp. in word recognition, spelling, and the conversion of letters to sounds, occurring in a child with otherwise normal development, and now usually regarded as a neurodevelopmental disorder with a genetic component.")</ref> Acquired dyslexia occurs subsequent to neurological insult, such as [[traumatic brain injury]] or [[stroke]]. People with acquired dyslexia exhibit some of the signs or symptoms of the developmental disorder, but requiring different assessment strategies and treatment approaches.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Woollams|first=Anna M.|date=2014-01-19|title=Connectionist neuropsychology: uncovering ultimate causes of acquired dyslexia|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|language=en|volume=369|issue=1634|pages=20120398|doi=10.1098/rstb.2012.0398|issn=0962-8436|pmc=3866427|pmid=24324241}}</ref>

==Signs and symptoms==

In early childhood, symptoms that correlate with a later diagnosis of dyslexia include [[speech delay|delayed onset]] of speech and a lack of phonological awareness.<ref name=Handler2011/> A common myth closely associates dyslexia with mirror writing and reading letters or words backwards.<ref name="LilienfeldLynn2011">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8DlS0gfO_QUC&pg=PT88|title=50 Great Myths of Popular Psychology: Shattering Widespread Misconceptions about Human Behavior|last2=Lynn|first2=Steven Jay|last3=Ruscio|first3=John|last4=Beyerstein|first4=Barry L.|date=15 September 2011|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=978-1-4443-6074-5|pages=88–89|last1=Lilienfeld|first1=Scott O.|author-link1=Scott Lilienfeld|author-link4=Barry Beyerstein|accessdate=19 May 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170109130327/https://books.google.com/books?id=8DlS0gfO_QUC&pg=PT88|archive-date=9 January 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref> These behaviors are seen in many children as they learn to read and write, and are not considered to be defining characteristics of dyslexia.<ref name=Handler2011/>

Problems persist into adolescence and adulthood and may include difficulties with summarizing stories, memorization, reading aloud, or learning foreign languages. Adults with dyslexia can often read with good comprehension, though they tend to read more slowly than others without a learning difficulty and perform worse in [[spelling]] tests or when reading nonsense words–a measure of phonological awareness.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Jarrad|first1=Lum|title=Procedural learning is impaired in dyslexia: evidence from a meta-analysis of serial reaction time studies|journal=Research of Developmental Disabilities|date=October 2013|pages=3460–76|pmid=23920029|pmc=3784964|doi=10.1016/j.ridd.2013.07.017|volume=34|issue=10}}</ref>

The cerebellar theory of dyslexia proposes that impairment of cerebellum-controlled muscle movement affects the formation of words by the tongue and facial muscles, resulting in the [[fluency]] problems that some people with dyslexia experience. The cerebellum is also involved in the [[Autonomic nervous system|automatization]] of some tasks, such as reading.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Cain|first1=Kate|title=Reading development and difficulties|date=2010|publisher=TJ International|page=134|edition=1st|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FT6RALjOr9QC&q=cerebellar+theory+of+dyslexia&pg=PA134|accessdate=21 March 2015|isbn=9781405151559}}</ref> The fact that some children with dyslexia have motor task and balance impairments could be consistent with a cerebellar role in their reading difficulties.

===Genetics===
Research into potential genetic causes of dyslexia has its roots in post-autopsy examination of the brains of people with dyslexia.<ref name="Stein2014" /> Observed anatomical differences in the [[language center]]s of such brains include microscopic [[cerebral cortex|cortical]] malformations known as [[wikt:ectopia|ectopias]], and more rarely, [[blood vessel|vascular]] micro-malformations, and [[microgyrus]]—a smaller than usual size for the gyrus.<ref name="Faust2012">{{cite book|author=Faust, Miriam|title=The Handbook of the Neuropsychology of Language|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UEWVqdNFL4cC&pg=PA941|year=2012|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=978-1-4443-3040-3|pages=941–43|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170109200538/https://books.google.com/books?id=UEWVqdNFL4cC&pg=PA941|archive-date=9 January 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The previously cited studies and others<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Benitez|first1=A|title=Neurobiology and neurogenetics of dyslexia|journal=Neurology (In Spanish)|date=November 2010|pmid=21093706|doi=10.1016/j.nrl.2009.12.010|volume=25|issue=9|pages=563–81|doi-access=free}}</ref> suggest that abnormal cortical development, presumed to occur before or during the sixth month of [[fetal]] brain development, may have caused the abnormalities.

===Gene–environment interaction===
The contribution of gene–environment interaction to reading disability has been intensely studied using [[twin studies]], which estimate the proportion of variance associated with a person's environment and the proportion associated with their genes. Both environmental and genetic factors appear to contribute to reading development. Studies examining the influence of environmental factors such as parental education<ref>{{Cite journal |title=Parental Education Moderates Genetic Influences on Reading Disability |journal=Psychol.

As environment plays a large role in learning and memory, it is likely that [[epigenetic]] modifications play an important role in reading ability. Measures of [[gene expression]], [[Histone#Histone modification|histone modifications]], and [[methylation]] in the human periphery are used to study epigenetic processes; however, all of these have limitations in the extrapolation of results for application to the human brain.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Roth |first1=Tania L. |last2=Roth |first2=Eric D. |last3=Sweatt |first3=J.

==Pathophysiology==
[[File:Gray733.png|thumb|140px|Corpus callosum view, front part at top of image]]

Most people who are right-hand dominant have the left hemisphere of their brain specialize more in language processing. In terms of the mechanism of dyslexia, fMRI studies suggest that this specialization may be less pronounced or even absent in cases with dyslexia. Additionally, anatomical differences in the [[corpus callosum]], the bundle of nerve fibers that connects the left and right hemispheres, have been linked to dyslexia via different studies.<ref name="habi">{{cite book |last1=Habib |first1=Michael |title=Pediatric Neurology Part I |volume=111 |chapter=Dyslexia |date=2013 |pages=229–235 |chapter-url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780444528919000233 |accessdate=19 December 2018 |language=en|doi=10.1016/B978-0-444-52891-9.00023-3 |pmid=23622168 |series=Handbook of Clinical Neurology |isbn=9780444528919 }}</ref>

====Assessment tests====
There is a wide range of tests that are used in clinical and educational settings to evaluate the possibility that a person might have dyslexia.<ref name="testing">{{cite web|url=http://dyslexiahelp.umich.edu/dyslexics/learn-about-dyslexia/dyslexia-testing/tests|title=Tests for Dyslexia and Learning Disabilities|publisher=University of Michigan|accessdate=15 March 2015|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150313000802/http://dyslexiahelp.umich.edu/dyslexics/learn-about-dyslexia/dyslexia-testing/tests|archive-date=13 March 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref> If initial testing suggests that a person might have dyslexia, such tests are often followed up with a full diagnostic assessment to determine the extent and nature of the disorder.<ref name="PeerReid2013p">{{cite book|author1=Peer, Lindsay|author2=Reid, Gavin|title=Introduction to Dyslexia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OTiAAAAAQBAJ&pg=PT35|year=2013|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=978-1-135-37290-3|pages=35–40|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170109134343/https://books.google.com/books?id=OTiAAAAAQBAJ&pg=PT35|archive-date=9 January 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Some tests can be administered by a teacher or computer; others require specialized training and are given by psychologists.<ref name=balexia/> Some test results indicate how to carry out teaching strategies.<ref name="balexia">{{cite web|title=Screening and assessment|url=http://www.bdadyslexia.org.uk/educator/screening-and-assessment|website=British Dyslexia Association|accessdate=11 March 2015|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150330101403/http://www.bdadyslexia.org.uk/educator/screening-and-assessment|archive-date=30 March 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Fletcher|first1=Jack|title=Dyslexia: the evolution of a scientific concept|journal=Journal of International Neuropsychology Society|date=2009|pages=501–508|pmc=3079378|pmid=19573267|doi=10.1017/S1355617709090900|volume=15|issue=4}}</ref> Because a variety of different cognitive, behavioral, emotional, and environmental factors all could contribute to difficultly learning to read, a comprehensive evaluation should consider these different possibilities.

* General measures of cognitive ability, such as the [[Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children]], [[Woodcock–Johnson Tests of Cognitive Abilities|Woodcock-Johnson Tests of Cognitive Abilities]], or [[Stanford–Binet Intelligence Scales|Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scales]]. Low general cognitive ability would make reading more difficult. Cognitive ability measures also often try to measure different cognitive processes, such as verbal ability, nonverbal and spatial reasoning, working memory, and processing speed. There are different versions of these tests for different age groups. Almost all of these require additional training to give and score correctly, and are done by psychologists. According to Mather and Schneider (2015), a confirmatory profile and/or pattern of scores on cognitive tests confirming or ruling-out reading disorder has not yet been identified.<ref>Mather, N., & Schneider, D.

* Screening or evaluation for mental health conditions: Parents and teachers can complete rating scales or behavior checklists to gather information about emotional and behavioral functioning for younger people. Many checklists have similar versions for parents, teachers, and younger people old enough to read reasonably well (often 11 years and older) to complete. Examples include the Behavioral Assessment System for Children, and the [[Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire]]. All of these have nationally representative norms, making it possible to compare the level of symptoms to what would be typical for the younger person's age and biological sex. Other checklists link more specifically to psychiatric diagnoses, such as the [[Vanderbilt ADHD diagnostic rating scale|Vanderbilt ADHD Rating Scales]] or the [[Screen for child anxiety related disorders|Screen for Child Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders (SCARED)]]. [[Screening (medicine)|Screening]] uses brief tools that are designed to catch cases with a disorder, but they often get false positive scores for people who do not have the disorder. Screeners should be followed up by a more accurate test or diagnostic interview as a result. Depressive disorders and anxiety disorders are two-three times higher in people with dyslexia, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder is more common, as well.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Collett |first1=Brent R. |last2=Ohan |first2=Jeneva L. |last3=Myers |first3=Kathleen M. |title=Ten-Year Review of Rating Scales.

* Review of academic achievement and skills: Average spelling/reading ability for a dyslexic is a percentage ranking <16, well below normal. In addition to reviewing grades and teacher notes, standardized test results are helpful in evaluating progress. These include group administered tests, such as the [[Iowa Tests of Educational Development]], that a teacher may give to a group or whole classroom of younger people at the same time. They also could include individually administered tests of achievement, such as the [[Wide Range Achievement Test]], or the [[Woodcock–Johnson Tests of Cognitive Abilities|Woodcock-Johnson]] (which also includes a set of achievement tests).

==Screening==
Screening procedures seek to identify children who show signs of possible dyslexia. In the preschool years, a family history of dyslexia, particularly in biological parents and siblings, predicts an eventual dyslexia diagnosis better than any test.<ref>Catherine Christo, John M. Davis, and Stephen E. Brock, ''Identifying, Assessing, and Treating Dyslexia at School'' (New York: Springer Science+Business Media, 2009), 56. {{ISBN|9780387885995}}</ref> In primary school (ages 5–7), the ideal screening procedure consist of training primary school teachers to carefully observe and record their pupils' progress through the phonics curriculum, and thereby identify children progressing slowly.<ref>Margaret J.

In the medical setting, child and adolescent psychiatrist M. S. Thambirajah emphasizes that "[g]iven the high prevalence of developmental disorders in school-aged children, all children seen in clinics should be systematically screened for developmental disorders irrespective of the presenting problem/s." Thambirajah recommends screening for developmental disorders, including dyslexia, by conducting a brief developmental history, a preliminary psychosocial developmental examination, and obtaining a school report regarding academic and social functioning.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Developmental assessment of the school-aged child with developmental disabilities : a clinician's guide|last=Thambirajah, M.

Since at least the 1960s in the UK, the children diagnosed with developmental dyslexia have consistently been from privileged families.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|last=Kale|first=Sirin|date=2020-09-17|title=The Battle over Dyslexia|url=http://www.theguardian.com/news/2020/sep/17/battle-over-dyslexia-warwickshire-staffordshire|access-date=2020-09-28|website=The Guardian|language=en}}</ref> Although half of prisoners in the UK have significant reading difficulties, very few have ever been evaluated for dyslexia.<ref name=":0" /> Access to some special educational resources and funding is contingent upon having a diagnosis of dyslexia.<ref name=":0" />  As a result, when [[Staffordshire]] and [[Warwickshire]] proposed in 2018 to teach reading to all children with reading difficulties, using techniques proven to be successful for most children with a diagnosis of dyslexia, without first requiring the families to obtain an official diagnosis, dyslexia advocates and parents of children with dyslexia were fearful that they were losing a privileged status.<ref name=":0" />
