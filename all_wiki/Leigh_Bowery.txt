'''Leigh Bowery''' (26 March 1961 – 31 December 1994) was an [[Australian people|Australian]] [[performance artist]], [[club promoter]], and [[fashion designer]]. Bowery was known for his flamboyant and outlandish costumes and makeup as well as his (sometimes controversial) performances. Based in London for much of his adult life, he was a significant model and muse<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2002/jul/21/features.review27|title=Leigh Bowery, ideal husband|last=Ellen|first=Barbara|date=20 July 2002|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=25 July 2017|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> for the English painter [[Lucian Freud]]. Bowery's friend and fellow performer [[Boy George]] said he saw Bowery's outrageous performances a number of times, and that it "never ceased to impress or revolt".<ref name="Richardson, John 1995">Richardson, John.

== Early life and early years in London ==
Bowery was born and raised in [[Sunshine, Victoria|Sunshine]], a [[suburb]] of [[Melbourne]], Australia. From an early age, he studied music, played [[piano]], and went on to study fashion and design at RMIT for a year.<ref>Bowery, Leigh. Hannover, Kunstverein, editor. Zechlin, René, ed. Stuffer, Ute, ed. ''Leigh Bowery''. Kehrer Publications (2008) {{ISBN|978-3-86828-033-3}}</ref> He moved to London in 1980: 'I was so itchy to see new things and to see the world that I just left', he said in 1987.<ref>Jillian Burt 'Night Owl Spreads His Wings' Melbourne Age 11 February 1987 p. 18</ref> There he found himself part of the [[New Romantic]] [[club scene]]. He worked in a clothing shop and appeared in commercials for Pepe jeans. He soon became an influential and lively figure in the underground clubs of London and New York, as well as in art and fashion circles. He attracted attention by wearing wildly outlandish and creative outfits that he made himself. He became friends and roommates with Guy Barnes (known as "Trojan") and David Walls: Bowery created costumes for them to wear, and the trio became known in the clubs as the Three Kings.<ref>"Leigh Bowery, 33, Artist and Model". ''The New York Times''. 7 January 1995.</ref>
In 2005 The National Portrait Gallery of Australia acquired a portrait of Bowery in his infamous fur coat by photographer David Gwinnutt. In 2007 The National Portrait Gallery, London purchased the David Gwinnutt portrait of Leigh Bowery and Trojan (Guy Barnes) which also appears in the Violette Editions book.

== Taboo ==
He was known as a [[club promoter]], and created the club called Taboo, which began as an underground party, and then opened as a club in 1985.<ref name=ThGrdn1382018>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/aug/13/sex-sin-and-sausages-the-debauched-brilliance-of-leigh-bowery|title=Sex, sin and sausages: the debauched brilliance of Leigh Bowery|last=Cochrane|first=Lauren|date=13 August 2018|work=The Guardian|accessdate=13 August 2018}}</ref> Taboo soon became "the place to be" with long [[queue area|queues]] for those waiting to get in. Drugs, particularly [[MDMA|ecstasy]], became a part of the dancing scene for the attendees. The club was known for defying sexual convention, for embracing "[[polysexual]]ism", for creating a wild atmosphere, and for playing unexpected song selections.<ref>Bowery, Leigh. Hannover, Kunstverein, editor. Zechlin, René, ed. Ute StufferLeigh, Ute, ed. ''Leigh Bowery''. Kehrer Publications (2008) {{ISBN|978-3-86828-033-3}}</ref>

== Fashion and costume design ==
As a [[fashion designer]] he had several collections and shows in London, [[New York City|New York]] and [[Tokyo]]. He has influenced designers and artists. He was known for wildly creative [[costume]]s, [[makeup]], [[wig]]s and [[headgear]], all of which combined to be striking and inventive and often kitschy or beautiful.<ref name=Grdn1112015>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/nov/01/the-night-i-put-leigh-bowery-on-the-catwalk-iain-r-webb|title=The night I put Leigh Bowery on the catwalk – and he stole the show|work=The Guardian|date=1 November 2015|author=Iain R Webb}}</ref>

He also designed costumes for the [[Michael Clark (dancer)|Michael Clark]] Dance Company. When that company performed at the [[Brooklyn Academy of Music]] in 1987, Bowery won a [[Bessie Award]] for his work on ''No Fire Escape in Hell''.<ref name=Grdn1112015/><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2002/jul/21/features.review27|title=Leigh Bowery, ideal husband|work=The Guardian|date=20 July 2002|author=Barbara Ellen}}</ref>

== Performance artist ==
As a [[performance artist]] he enjoyed creating the costumes, and often shocking audiences. He first appeared at the Anthony D'Offay Gallery in London in 1988. In a signature performance, he would appear on stage in outlandish drag or other costume, looking very huge. He would sing and dance about. Then suddenly, much to the audience's surprise, he would drop onto his back and simulate giving [[birth]] to a petite and naked young woman, who was his friend, assistant, and later wife Nicola Bateman. She had been hidden for the first part of the performance by being strapped to Leigh's belly with her face in his crotch. Then she would slip out of her harness and appear to pop out of Bowery's belly along with a lot of [[stage blood]] and links of sausages, while Bowery wailed.  Bowery would then bite off the umbilical cord and the two would take a bow. [[Boy George]] said he saw it a number of times, and that it "never ceased to impress or revolt".<ref name="Richardson, John 1995"/><ref name=IntMag/>

== Lucian Freud's model ==
In London in 1988, Bowery met the noted painter [[Lucian Freud]] in his club Taboo. They were introduced by a friend they had in common, the artist [[Cerith Wyn Evans]]. Freud had seen Bowery perform at Anthony d'Offay Gallery, in London. In Bowery's first public appearance in the context of fine art, Bowery posed behind a one-way mirror in the gallery dressed in the flamboyant costumes he was known for.

Bowery used his body and manipulation of his flesh to create personas. This involved almost masochistically taping his torso and piercing his cheeks with pins in order to hold masks, as well as wearing outlandish makeup.  Freud said, "the way he edits his body is amazingly aware and amazingly abandoned". In return, Bowery said of Freud: "I love the psychological aspect of his work – in fact, I sometimes felt as if I had been undergoing psychoanalysis with him ... His work is full of tension. Like me, he is interested in the underbelly of things".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/freud-leigh-bowery-t06834|title=Lucian Freud, Leigh Bowery (1991)|website=Tate Britain|date=March 2003|author=Elizabeth Manchester}}</ref> Bowery posed for a number of large full-length paintings that are considered among Freud's best work. The paintings tend to exaggerate Bowery's 6-foot 3inch, and 17 stone physique to monumental proportions. The paintings had a strong impact as part of Freud's exhibition at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in 1994. Freud said he found him "perfectly beautiful", and commented, "His wonderfully buoyant bulk was an instrument I felt I could use, especially those extraordinary dancer's legs". Freud noted that Leigh by nature was a shy and gentle man, and his flamboyant persona was in part a form of self-defence.<ref>Hauser, Kitty. "Leigh Bowery and Lucian Freud: the model and the artist".

Jonathan Jones, writing for ''[[The Guardian]]'' describes Freud's portrait, ''Leigh Bowery (seated)'':<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2000/nov/18/art|title=Leigh Bowery (Seated), Lucian Freud (1990)|work=The Guardian|date=18 November 2000|author=Jonathan Jones|accessdate=13 August 2018}}</ref>

{{Quote|text=Bowery is a character out of Renaissance art - perhaps Silenus, the companion of Dionysus. His flesh is a magnificent ruin, at once damaged and riotously alive. Who knew skin was so particoloured? To count the hues of even one of his feet is impossible: purple, grey, yellow, brown, the paint creamy, calloused, bulging. In a velvet chair tilted down towards us on the raked stage of the wooden studio floor, his mass looms up and dwarfs us. Walk close your eyes are probably the height of his penis. Bowery's violet-domed, wrinkly tube hangs between thighs marked with sinister spots or cuts his knees are massive. Bowery is a painted monument who quietly contemplates his existence inside this flesh.}}

[[File:THE LEGEND OF LEIGH BOWERY.jpg|thumb|250px|Promotional still from the documentary ''The Legend of Leigh Bowery''.]]
In 1993, Bowery formed the [[Romo]]/art-pop<ref>https://rockshotmagazine.com/legendary-art-pop-icons-minty-reissue-open-wide/</ref> band Minty with friend [[knitwear]] designer Richard Torry, Nicola Bateman, and Matthew Glammore.

In November 1994, Minty began a two-week-long show at London's Freedom Cafe, including audience member [[Alexander McQueen]], but it was too much for [[Westminster City Council]], who closed down the show after only one night. This was to be Bowery's last performance. The show was documented by photographer [[A.M. Hanson]] with imagery subsequently published in books about Bowery<ref>{{cite book|author1=Robert Violette|author2=Leigh Bowery|year=1998|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j9I3AQAAIAAJ|title=Leigh Bowery|publisher=Violette Editions|isbn=978-3-86828-033-3}}</ref><ref>''Leigh Bowery Verwandlungskünstler,'' ed: Angela Stief (Piet Meyer Verlag) 2015</ref> and McQueen.<ref>''Alexander McQueen The Life and The Legacy'', Judith Watt (Harper Design) 2012</ref><ref>''Alexander McQueen Blood Beneath the Skin'', Andrew Wilson (Simon & Schuster) 2015</ref> Minty was a financial loss and represented a low point in Bowery's colourful career. After his death, the band continued under the leadership of Bateman and Glammore up until the release of album ''Open Wide''. This 1997 album was released on Candy Records and featured the singles "Useless Man"<ref>https://www.resident-music.com/productdetails&product_id=69126</ref> and "That's Nice". A spin-off band called The Offset later formed including artist Donald Urquhart.<ref name="DUUM">{{cite journal|journal=[[Out (magazine)|Out]]|title=Back in the Gay|first=Donald|last=Urquhart|date=February 2009|issn=1062-7928}}</ref>

In 2020, ''Open Wide'' was re-issued by Candy Records in association with The state51 Conspiracy, while "Useless Man" received a remix by Boy George and a new promo video directed by Torry and Glammore.<ref>https://rockshotmagazine.com/legendary-art-pop-icons-minty-reissue-open-wide/</ref>

== Personal life ==
Although Bowery was known to be and always described himself as gay, he married his long-time female companion Nicola Bateman on 13 May 1994 in [[London Borough of Tower Hamlets|Tower Hamlets]], [[London]], in "a personal art performance". Although he had been [[HIV positive]] for six years, very few of those who knew him guessed that; he typically explained his public absence by saying he had gone to Papua New Guinea.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituaries-leigh-bowery-1566637.html|title=Obituaries Leigh Bowery|work=[[The Independent]]|date=5 January 1995|author=Phillip Hoare|accessdate=13 August 2018}}</ref> His wife did not know that Bowery had the virus until he was admitted to hospital. He died 7 months after his marriage, on New Year's Eve 1994 (the date has been disputed by his father, who says he actually died in the early hours of New Year's Day, 1995),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://meanjin.com.au/blog/a-dilettantes-31-dot-points-on-the-unveiling-of-the-bowery-theatre-st-albans/|title=A Dilettante's 31 Dot Points on the Unveiling of the Bowery Theatre, St Albans|website=[[Meanjin]]|date=21 September 2017|author=Michael Winkler|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170926100338/https://meanjin.com.au/blog/a-dilettantes-31-dot-points-on-the-unveiling-of-the-bowery-theatre-st-albans/|archivedate=26 September 2017}}</ref> from an [[AIDS]]-related illness at the [[Middlesex Hospital]], [[City of Westminster|Westminster]], London, five weeks after his admission.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/a-bizarre-body-of-work-1574885.html|title=A Bizarre Body of Work {{!}} The night-clubs of Eighties London were full of posers; none could pose like Leigh Bowery, who died on New Year's Eve.

Did he eventually succeed? line standfirst|work=The Independent|date=26 February 1995|author=Ian Parker|accessdate=13 August 2018}}</ref> Lucian Freud paid for Bowery's body to be flown back to Australia.

== ''Taboo'', the musical ==
[[Boy George]] was the creative force, the [[lyricist]] and performer in the [[Musical theatre|musical]] ''[[Taboo (musical)|Taboo]]'', which was loosely based on Bowery's club. The musical was produced in 2002 on the [[West End of London|West End]] in London, and then opened on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]. As a performer, Boy George played a character named "Leigh Bowery".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/4727348/Mad-about-the-Boy.html|title=Mad About the Boy|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=31 January 2002|author=Charles Spencer}}</ref>

In an interview conducted by [[Mark Ronson]] for ''[[Interview Magazine]]'' Boy George said that Bowery would sometimes speak with a [[Upper class|posh]] English accent, and one didn't always know if he was sincere or mocking: He seemed to be "in character" at all times. Bowery decorated his flat in a style that was similar to the way he dressed, with [[Star Trek]]-themed wallpaper, mirrors and a large [[piano]]. He was a ringleader of misbehaviour, and with his club, he created a place where there were no rules. In the clubs at the peak of his fame, he would distort his body in various ways so that he would appear deformed, or pregnant or with breasts. Bowery once said, "Flesh is my most favourite fabric".<ref name=IntMag/>

== In popular culture ==
Bowery influenced other artists and designers including Meadham Kirchhoff, [[Alexander McQueen]], [[Lucian Freud]], [[Vivienne Westwood]], [[Boy George]], [[Antony and the Johnsons]], [[Lady Gaga]], [[John Galliano]], [[Scissor Sisters]], [[David LaChapelle]], [[Lady Bunny]], [[RuPaul's Drag Race (season 8)|Acid Betty]], [[Shea Couleé]], plus numerous [[new Rave|Nu-Rave]] bands and nightclubs in London and New York City.

Bowery was the main inspiration for the [[Tranimal]] [[Drag queen|drag]] movement, which emphasized an animalistic and post-modern take on drag.<ref>{{cite web|last=Romano|first=Tricia|title=How to Become a Tranimal|url=http://www.bbook.com/how-to-become-a-tranimal/|work=[[BlackBook]]|date=1 December 2009|accessdate=8 May 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Clifton|first=Jamie|title=Why Be a Tranny When You Can Be a Tranimal?|url=https://www.vice.com/en_uk/read/tranimals-jer-ber-jones|work=[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]|date=26 June 2012|accessdate=23 April 2013}}</ref>

The look of the character Vulva in the third episode of British TV comedy series ''[[Spaced]]'' was inspired by Leigh Bowery.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spaced-out.org.uk/episode-guides/series-one/official/e3.shtml|title=Episode Guide: Series One: Official: Episode Three|work=Spaced Out}}</ref>

In ''[[Noel Fielding's Luxury Comedy]]'' season 2 episode 2, Noel is advised to give his ''fantasy block'' a physical/visual form.  He describes it as ''...rotund but kind of stylish, like a Leigh Bowery creation.'' Bowery had been an influence on Fielding's outlandish costume characters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/programmes/noel-fieldings-luxury-comedy/profiles/all/fantasy-block|title=Noel Fielding's Luxury Comedy - Profiles - All 4|website=[[Channel 4]]|accessdate=31 July 2017}}</ref>

Bowery was the subject of a [[contemporary dance]], [[physical theatre]] and [[circus]] show in August 2018 at the [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe|Edinburgh fringe festival]], put on by Australian choreographer Andy Howitt.<ref name=ThGrdn1382018/><ref>{{cite news|url=https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/sunshine-boy|title=Sunshine Boy|work=Edinburgh Festival Fringe|accessdate=13 August 2018}}</ref>
