Lorak became known outside of the [[Post-Soviet states|former Soviet Union]] after she represented Ukraine at the [[Ukraine in the Eurovision Song Contest 2008|Eurovision Song Contest 2008]] with the song "[[Shady Lady (Ani Lorak song)|Shady Lady]]", coming in second place behind [[Dima Bilan]] from [[Russia]].<ref>[http://www.unian.net/eng/news/news-237988.html UNIAN - Ani Lorak to sing song of Kirkorov in Eurovision<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/7401447.stm [[BBC]] Ukraine's 2008 Eurovision song (including [[videoclip]])]</ref>

==Early life==
Ani Lorak had a notably tough childhood. Born in Kitsman Western Ukraine, speaking Ukrainian as her native language, Karolina was raised by a single mother. At the age of 6, she and her brothers were placed in a foster home. One of her brothers later died when fighting in Afghanistan.<ref>http://www.kyivpost.com/guide/all/the-amazing-ani-lorak-story-87142.html</ref> Karolina Kuiek developed the desire to become a singer as early as the age of four. She often performed at various school vocal competitions. In 1992, she took part in the popular contest 'Pervotsvit' and was the winner. It was here where she met her ex-producer Yuriy Falyosa. As a result, at the age of 14 she signed her first professional contract. Kuiek became known as Ani Lorak in March 1995 when she took part in a contest at the television program "Morning Star" in [[Moscow]], [[Russia]]. There was a Russian singer with the same name already enrolled in that competition so Kuiek had to invent a stage name. ''Ani Lorak'' is the name ''Karolina'' read backwards. Ani Lorak moved to [[Kyiv]] in 1995. By that time her name was well known in Ukrainian show business. She became even more popular after winning the "Big Apple Music 1996 Competition" in [[New York City]]. She was named "Discovery of the Year" at the popular Ukrainian festival "Tavria Games" in 1996. The same year she released her first album "I Want to Fly".

==1997–2011==

Lorak continued recording new songs in 1997. Her two videos "The Model" and "My God" were filmed and the latter became a soundtrack to the movie "The Right to Choose". In the spring of 1998 her new video "I will be back" was shot and in December Lorak's second album "I will be back" was released. Mastering of this album took place in New York. Simultaneously her two music videos "Oh my love" and "A Stranger's City" were filmed to accompany her new album. At the outset of 1999 she started extensive touring, performing in the US, [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Hungary]], and her concerts took place in every major city of Ukraine. In 1999 she earned the title of the [[Honoured Artist of Ukraine]].<ref>{{in lang|ru}} [http://www.focus.ua/dossier/73573 Ани Лорак] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111222309/http://www.focus.ua/dossier/73573 |date=2013-11-11 }}, [[Focus (Ukrainian magazine)|Focus]]</ref>

In the spring of 2000 Ani Lorak recorded the soundtrack for an advert for the Chocolate "[[Korona (chocolate)|Korona]]" at the [[London]] studio "Astoria". Here, the singer met [[United Kingdom|British]] composers [[Burrie Guard]] and [[Josh Phillips (composer)|Josh Phillips]]. Also, in London Lorak recorded new songs. In 2004-2005 Ani Lorak was a [[UN]] Good Will Ambassador in Ukraine for [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]].

In October 2009, Lorak was ranked 41st in a top 100 of "most influential women in Ukraine" compiled by experts for the Ukrainian magazine [[Focus (Ukrainian magazine)|Focus]].<ref>{{in lang|ru}} [http://focus.ua/charts/73740 Рейтинг Фокуса: 100 самых влиятельных женщин и 100 деталей о них] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140227220327/http://focus.ua/charts/73740 |date=2014-02-27 }}, [[Focus (Ukrainian magazine)|Focus]]</ref>

==Business ventures==

In 2005, Ani Lorak and her fiancé Murat opened the Angel Lounge, a restaurant that specializes in Mediterranean cuisine in the center of [[Kyiv]].<ref>[http://www.kievtown.net/eng/kiev_restaurants/restaurant_angel_lounge.htm]</ref>  In 2009, they opened a Ukrainian travel agency called "Holiday Travel", which is a sub-division of "Turtess Travel", a company Murat works for.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.anilorak.com/en/news/3573.html |accessdate=July 9, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110919102828/http://www.anilorak.com/en/news/3573.html |archivedate=September 19, 2011 }}</ref> In 2010, Lorak became an Oriflame advert. She participated in several catalogues and developed a new fragrance called Chiffon by Ani Lorak.<ref>[http://www.je-taime.org.ua/novinki-duhov/chiffon-by-ani-lorak.html Шифон от Ани Лорак] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110211212821/http://www.je-taime.org.ua/novinki-duhov/chiffon-by-ani-lorak.html |date=February 11, 2011 }}</ref>

In 2011, Lorak was announced the fifth richest singer in Ukraine, with her team's revenues amounting to $2.35 million that year. Her typical fee is $25,000-$40,000 per concert.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blacks.com.ua/blackswave/news/116.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-06-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110812130446/http://blacks.com.ua/blackswave/news/116.html |archivedate=2011-08-12 }}</ref>

In 2014 the singer was criticised in Ukraine for having accepted awards in [[Russia]] while Ukraine had conflicts with Russia. Lorak then told reporters that she was a true Ukrainian patriot and loved her country dearly, advising her critics to “go and join [the] Anti-Terror Operation”

== Personal life ==
On 21 August 2009 Lorak married her longtime [[Turkish people|Turkish]] fiancé and manager Murat Nalçacıoğlu, whom she met in 2003 when vacationing in Turkey.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20090822123918/http://www.esctoday.com/news/read/14251 Ani Lorak married]</ref> Murat Nalçacıoğlu, is a Turkish hotel manager and travel agent.

==Eurovision==
[[File:Ani Lorak cropped.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Lorak in Serbia at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2008]], Semi-final.]]

===2005===
In 2005, Ani Lorak made her first attempt to perform at the [[Eurovision Song Contest]] and was virtually certain to sing the home country's entry in [[Kyiv]], but ultimately failed to be selected. Her narrow defeat in the 2005 national pre-selection competition was particularly controversial, given that the winners, [[GreenJolly]], did not have to qualify for the final by winning one of the fifteen preliminary heats (unlike her). Lorak finished in second place in the Ukrainian national final with the song ''A Little Shot Of Love''.

===2008===
Having come close to singing the home country's entry in 2005, when [[Ukraine]] staged the [[Eurovision Song Contest]], Ukrainian television [[National Television Company of Ukraine|NTU]] announced in late December that Ani Lorak, one of the country's most successful singers would represent the country at Eurovision in [[Belgrade]] and that the public and a jury would choose the song.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://gazeta.ua/ru/articles/culture-newspaper/_ani-lorak-poedet-na-evrovidenie-bez-konkursa/199550 | title = Ani Lorak will go to Eurovision without a contest | date=2007-12-25 |language=ru | work = gazeta.ua|accessdate=2020-05-25}}</ref> On 23 February, Ani performed five potential entries, in a special show and the winner, chosen by both the public and by the jury was "[[Shady Lady (Ani Lorak song)|Shady Lady]]",<ref>Clip of performance of "Shady Lady" at the preselection {{cite web|url=http://tabloid.pravda.com.ua/focus/47c2d697d2a78/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-05-22 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080329202613/http://tabloid.pravda.com.ua/focus/47c2d697d2a78/ |archivedate=2008-03-29 |language=uk}}</ref> written by Greek composer and producer [[Dimitris Kontopoulos]], also known in the Eurovision bubble.

She also recorded a [[Russian language|Russian]] version of her [[Eurovision]] song "Shady Lady" with the title "S neba v nebo". Ani had visited other countries to present her song, like [[Malta]], [[Russia]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Spain]] and [[Germany]]. At the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2008|2008 Eurovision Song Contest]] in Belgrade, she sang the song "Shady Lady" in the second semi final on 23 May 2008, winning a place in the final. She took the second place in the final after Dima Bilan. She was awarded a prize for being the Best Artist at the contest from the media. Italian designer [[Roberto Cavalli]] designed a dress for Ani Lorak performance at the festival. The ornate dress was made with [[Swarovski]] [[Diamonds]], and her choreography produced by [[Fokas Evangelinos]] who designed the stage show for her entry. He also arranged the stage shows of Greece 2005, Russia 2006 and Belarus 2007.

== Charity ==

Lorak spends a lot of time on charitable activities. Since 2004-2005 Lorak has been a UN Goodwill Ambassador on [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]] in Ukraine. [[UNICEF]] and [[United Nations|UN]] in Ukraine have awarded a commendation to Lorak for assistance and help to HIV positive citizens of Ukraine. In 2005, Lorak was conferred with [[Order of Saint Stanislaus|the St. Stanislav Order]] of the 4th degree and the Officer's Cross "for strengthening the international authority of Ukraine, for the high professionalism, great creative achievements, charity and adherence to the ideals of chivalry".<ref>[http://www.anilorak.com/en/biography/ Biography (Official website)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110114095613/http://www.anilorak.com/en/biography/ |date=January 14, 2011 }}</ref>
