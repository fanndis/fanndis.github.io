'''Donald Francis McGahn II''' ({{IPAc-en|d|ɒ|n|_|m|ə|ˈ|g|æ|n}}; born June 16, 1968) is an American lawyer who served as [[White House Counsel]] for U.S. President [[Donald Trump]], from the day of Trump's inauguration through October 17, 2018, when McGahn resigned. Previously, McGahn served on the [[Federal Election Commission]] for over five years. In November 2019, McGahn received a court order to testify before the U.S House of Representatives.

McGahn assembled a team of lawyers to oversee filling all judicial vacancies.

In November 2018 it was reported that in spring 2018, Trump told McGahn that he wanted the Justice Department to prosecute [[Hillary Clinton]] and [[James Comey]]. McGahn told Trump that he had no authority to order a prosecution and that while he could request an investigation, that too could prompt accusations of abuse of power. McGahn had White House lawyers write a memo to Trump warning that if he asked law enforcement to investigate his rivals, he could face possible impeachment.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/20/us/politics/president-trump-justice-department.html|title=Trump Wanted to Order Justice Dept. to Prosecute Comey and Clinton|first1=Michael S.|last1=Schmidt|first2=Maggie|last2=Haberman|date=November 20, 2018|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}</ref>

On November 25, 2019, U.S. District Judge [[Ketanji Brown Jackson]] ruled that McGahn, who the Trump administration ordered not to cooperate with the investigation, must cooperate with the investigation and comply with a House of Representatives subpoena to testify.<ref name="courtsubpoena">{{cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2019/11/25/782705643/federal-judge-rules-that-mcgahn-must-testify-delivering-blow-to-white-house|title=In Blow To White House, Federal Judge Rules That Don McGahn Must Testify|first=Bobby|last=Allyn|publisher=NPR|date=November 25, 2019|accessdate=November 25, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pacermonitor.com/public/case/29458255/COMMITTEE_ON_THE_JUDICIARY_OF_THE_US_HOUSE_OF_REPRESENTATIVES_v_MCGAHN_II|title=COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY OF THE U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES v.
