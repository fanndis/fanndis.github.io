"'''Gypsy'''" is a song recorded by American singer [[Lady Gaga]], for her third studio album ''[[Artpop]]'' (2013). It was written and produced by Gaga with French DJ [[Madeon]], with additional writing credits from [[RedOne]] and [[DJ White Shadow|Paul "DJ White Shadow" Blair]]. The song was developed with Madeon after Gaga's [[Born This Way Ball]] tour performance in France. "Gypsy" was described by Gaga as ''Artpop''{{'}}s most personal song; she elaborated that it was about travelling the world and the loneliness associated with it. A [[Europop]] and [[electropop]] song, "Gypsy" is a 1980s style "anthemic" track with piano and guitar instrumentation, and lyrically talks about Gaga's fans as being the people she feels closest to. The track was mistakenly assumed to be the third single from the album when [[Interscope Records]] listed it on their [[SoundCloud]] page reserved for future releases.

"Gypsy" received generally positive reviews from music critics who praised the composition, the simplicity of the production, the anthemic nature, as well as it being reminiscent of Gaga's own song, "[[The Edge of Glory]]". Gaga first performed the song during a listening party for ''Artpop'' in Berlin, while wearing a mustache. Subsequent performances happened at her [[ArtRave]] album release event, on the ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' television show, the ''[[Lady Gaga and the Muppets' Holiday Spectacular]]'' Thanksgiving special, as well as the encore on her 2014 [[ArtRave: The Artpop Ball]] world tour.

==Background and development==
Development of Lady Gaga's third studio album, ''[[Artpop]]'', began shortly after the release of her second one, ''[[Born This Way (album)|Born This Way]]'' in 2011, and by the following year, the album's concepts were "beginning to flourish" as Gaga collaborated with producers [[Fernando Garibay]] and [[DJ White Shadow]].<ref name=":1">{{cite news|last=Shewey|first=Don|date=July 30, 2013|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/eight-things-we-know-about-lady-gagas-artpop-20130730|title=Lady Gaga's 'ARTPOP': What We Know So Far|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|accessdate=February 21, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161212141658/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/eight-things-we-know-about-lady-gagas-artpop-20130730|archive-date=December 12, 2016}}</ref><ref name="DJWS">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1675019/lady-gaga-next-album-tour/|title=Lady Gaga 'Doing Prep' for Tour, Next Album|last=Vena|first=Jocelyn|date=November 28, 2011|accessdate=January 17, 2012|publisher=[[MTV News]]|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141211093036/http://www.mtv.com/news/1675019/lady-gaga-next-album-tour/|archive-date=December 11, 2014}}</ref><ref name="albumname">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1675458/lady-gaga-next-album/|title=Lady Gaga Says Next Album Is 'Beginning to Flourish'|last=Vena|first=Jocelyn|date=December 6, 2011|accessdate=January 17, 2012|publisher=MTV News|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140507183044/http://www.mtv.com/news/1675458/lady-gaga-next-album/|archive-date=May 7, 2014}}</ref> As Gaga travelled the world for her [[Born This Way Ball]] tour, she also collaborated with producer [[RedOne]], working remotely with each other. "We've been sending ideas.

In January 2014, [[Interscope Records]] had uploaded "Gypsy" to their [[SoundCloud]] account under the list of [[single (music)|singles]] they would send for [[airplay|radio play]].

==Recording and composition==
[[File:Madeon 2015.jpg|thumb|left|[[Madeon]] co-wrote the song with Gaga after visiting her at the Paris performance of the [[Born This Way Ball]] tour. He also co-produced the track with the singer.]]

Gaga did not spare any free time for the song's recording and would usually start the sessions after the Born This Way Ball show performances were over. Madeon noted: "She would still give everything – even on the demo take! She's really impressive."<ref name="gigwise"/> Madeon's production on ''Artpop'' differs from his usual work. According Dylan Farella of ''Dancing Astronaut'', the song "take[s] the mood of ''Artpop'' from ballad to anthem".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dancingastronaut.com/2013/11/editorial-what-every-electronic-music-fan-should-know-about-lady-gagas-artpop/|title=Editorial: What every electronic music fan should know about Lady Gaga's 'Artpop'|last=Farella|first=Dylan|date=November 6, 2013|accessdate=November 28, 2016|work=Dancing Astronaut|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161129024343/http://www.dancingastronaut.com/2013/11/editorial-what-every-electronic-music-fan-should-know-about-lady-gagas-artpop/|archive-date=November 29, 2016}}</ref> On French radio [[Les Indés Radios#Fully independent|Hit West]], Madeon recalled that in September 2012 he had gone to see Gaga at her Born This Way Ball show at Paris' [[Stade de France]]. After the performance, Gaga took Madeon to her hotel room. He played her some chords he had been working on for sometime. Gaga immediately started singing the main melody of "Gypsy", and then the main song "flowed out", leading them to write a [[demo (music)|demo]] the same night. Since Madeon had brought his computer with him, he recorded the ideas developed with Gaga so he would not forget them. Afterwards, the song went through various changes, and more musicians were added for the final version on the album.<ref>{{cite AV media|people=Madeon|date=November 28, 2013|title=J'ai Joue Avec Coldplay et Lady Gaga|medium=streaming|language=fr |time=20:00|location=Paris|publisher=[[Les Indés Radios#Fully independent|Hit West]]}}</ref>

"Gypsy" was written and produced by Gaga and Madeon, with additional songwriting by RedOne and White Shadow. It was [[sound recording and reproduction|recorded]] by Dave Russell, Bill Malina, Ghazi Hourani and Benjamin Rice at the [[Record Plant]] Studios, with additional recording carried out by Malina at CRC Studio in Hollywood, California. Andrew Robertson and Daniel Zaidenstadt assisted Rice in the recording sessions, while Steve Faye assisted Malina. Gaga did the guitar and piano [[arrangement]]s for the song alongside Tim Stewart, who worked on the acoustic guitars. Gaga also added the background vocals on "Gypsy" with Nicole and Natalie Ganther, and Lyon Gray. The song was [[audio mixing (recorded music)|mixed]] by Manny Marroquin at Larrabee North Studios; further mixing was done by Madeon at Popcultur Studio in France. Gene Grimaldi [[audio mastering|mastered]] the song at Oasis Mastering Studios, in Burbank, California.<ref name="liner"/>

"Gypsy" is the kind of arena anthem that already sounds like it's being belted in the middle of a sold-out [[Madison Square Garden]].
