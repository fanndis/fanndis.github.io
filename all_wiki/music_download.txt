A '''music download''' is the [[digital music|digital transfer of music]] via the [[Internet]] into a device capable of decoding and playing it, such as a [[personal computer]], [[portable media player]], [[MP3 player]] or [[smartphone]]. This term encompasses both legal [[download]]s and downloads of [[copyright]]ed material without permission or legal payment. According to a [[Nielsen Company|Nielsen]] report, downloadable music accounted for 55.9% of all [[music sales]] in the US in 2012.<ref group="nb">"All music sales" refers to albums plus track equivalent
 albums. A track equivalent album equates to 10 tracks.</ref><ref>{{cite web |title = Download Me Maybe: U.S. Music Market Up By 3.1%, Fuelled By 1.3B Digital Track Sales In 2012, Says Nielsen |first = Ingrid |last = Lunden |url = https://techcrunch.com/2013/01/04/download-me-maybe-u-s-music-market-up-by-3-1-fuelled-by-1-3b-digital-track-sales/ |work = [[TechCrunch]] |date = 4 January 2013 |access-date = 21 January 2013 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130106225037/http://techcrunch.com/2013/01/04/download-me-maybe-u-s-music-market-up-by-3-1-fuelled-by-1-3b-digital-track-sales/ |archive-date = 6 January 2013 |url-status=live |df = dmy-all }}</ref> By the beginning of 2011, Apple's [[iTunes Store]] alone made {{USD}}1.1 billion of revenue in the first quarter of its fiscal year.<ref>[http://www.fiercemobilecontent.com/story/apples-itunes-revenues-top-11-billion-q1/2011-01-19 Apple's iTunes revenues top $1.1 billion in Q1] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110512201333/http://www.fiercemobilecontent.com/story/apples-itunes-revenues-top-11-billion-q1/2011-01-19 |date=12 May 2011 }}, ''FierceMobileContent'' 19 January 2011</ref> Music downloads are typically encoded with [[modified discrete cosine transform]] (MDCT) [[audio data compression]], particularly the [[Advanced Audio Coding]] (AAC) format used by iTunes as well as the [[MP3]] [[audio coding format]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hwang |first1=Jenq-Neng |title=Multimedia Networking: From Theory to Practice |date=2009 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=9780521882040 |page=50 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5q2g7LkcNSkC&pg=PA50}}</ref>

Paid downloads are sometimes encoded with [[digital rights management]] that restricts copying the music or playing purchased songs on certain digital audio players. They are almost always [[Data compression|compressed]] using a [[lossy compression|lossy]] [[codec]] (usually MPEG-1 Layer 3, Windows Media, or AAC), which reduces file size and bandwidth requirements. These music resources have been created as a response to expanding technology and needs of customers who wanted easy, quick access to music. Their business models respond to the "download revolution" by making legal services attractive for users.

Even legal music downloads have faced a number of challenges from artists, record labels and the [[Recording Industry Association of America]]. In July 2007, the Universal Music Group decided not to renew their long-term contracts with iTunes. This decision was primarily based on the issue of pricing of songs, as Universal wanted to be able to charge more or less depending on the artist, a shift away from iTunes' standard—at the time—99 cents per song pricing. Many industry leaders feel that this is only the first of many show-downs between [[Apple Inc.]] and the various record labels.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/02/business/media/02universal.html|title=Universal in Dispute With Apple Over iTunes|first=Jeff|last=Leeds}}</ref>

According to research by the website [[TorrentFreak]], 38% of Swedish artists support file share downloading and claim that it helps artists in early career stages. Artists, including Swedish rock group Lamont, have profited from file sharing.<ref>[http://torrentfreak.com/sweden-artists-filesharing-080401/ "Swedish artists want to legalize filesharing"] 17 October 2011</ref>

==RIAA against illegal downloading==
The [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) oversees about 85% of published music production, distribution and manufacturing in the United States. They work to protect musicians while supporting the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] rights. Their stated goal is to support artists' creativity and help them not be cheated out of money by illegal downloading.<ref name=RIAA>{{cite web|title=For Students Doing Reports|url=https://www.riaa.com/faq.php|publisher=RIAA|access-date=30 April 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120410034407/http://www.riaa.com/faq.php|archive-date=10 April 2012}}</ref> The Recording Industry Association of America launched its first lawsuits on 8 September 2003, against individuals who illegally downloaded music files from the [[Kazaa]] [[FastTrack]] network.

Two years after it began, the campaign survived at least one major legal challenge.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}} The RIAA said it filed 750 suits in February 2006<ref name="Riaa Announces New Round of Music Theft Lawsuits">{{cite web|url=https://www.riaa.com/newsitem.php?news_month_filter=2&news_year_filter=2006&resultpage=&id=F7ED251F-6E08-52D9-A805-22662F5E4D4F|title=Riaa Announces New Round Of Music Theft Lawsuits}}</ref> against individuals downloading music files without paying for them in hopes of putting an end to Internet [[music piracy]]. The RIAA hopes their campaign will force people to respect the copyrights of music labels and eventually minimize the number of illegal downloads.<ref>Jason Krause. "Breaking up downloading".

The [[Official Charts Company]] began to incorporate downloads in the [[UK Singles Chart]] on 17 April 2005, at which time Radio 1 stopped broadcasting the separate download chart,{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} although the chart is still compiled. Initially this was on condition that the song must have a physical media release at the same time; this rule was fully lifted on 1 January 2007, meaning all download sales are now eligible in the chart.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}
