"'''Me!'''" (stylized in [[all caps]]) is a song by American singer-songwriter [[Taylor Swift]] featuring [[Brendon Urie]], the vocalist of [[Panic! at the Disco]], released on April 26, 2019, through [[Republic Records]]. As Swift's first single after signing with Republic Records,   the song was revealed and released at the end of a thirteen-day countdown, as the lead single from her seventh studio album, ''[[Lover (album)|Lover]]'' (2019). It was written by Swift, [[Joel Little]] and Urie, and produced by Swift and Little. The song was recorded at [[Electric Lady Studios]], New York City and Golden Age West in Auckland, New Zealand in 2018. "Me!" is a cheery, [[campy]] [[bubblegum pop]] and [[synth-pop]] [[duet]], driven by a [[marching band]] [[drumline]]. It is about [[Individualism|embracing one's individuality]], with lyrics on [[self-affirmation]] and [[self-love]].  

"Me!" debuted at number 100 on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] before surging up to number 2 the next week, breaking the record for the [[List of Billboard Hot 100 chart achievements and milestones#Biggest single-week upward movements|biggest single-week jump]] in the chart's history. The song reached the top three in several other countries. It broke four [[Amazon Music]] records, including the most first-day streams, most first-week streams and most on-demand voice requests with [[Amazon Alexa|Alexa]] of a single debut on the platform. Upon release, the song received mixed reviews from music critics, who were favorable towards the bubbly production and the duo's vocal chemistry, but divided over the lyrics—some complimented the "[[tongue-in-cheek]]" songwriting, while others called it "weak". In July 2019, "Me!" was certified [[RIAA certification|Platinum]] by [[Recording Industry Association of America]], for selling over 1 million copies in the US. In 2020, the single won the [[Hito Music Awards|Hito Music Award]] for Best Western Song. A live version of the song recorded at Swift's 2019 ''[[Lover (album)#City of Lover concert|City of Lover]]'' [[Lover (album)#City of Lover concert|concert]] in Paris was released for digital download and streaming on May 17, 2020, after the premiere of the concert film on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]. 

The "Me!" music video, directed by Swift and [[Dave Meyers (director)|Dave Meyers]], accompanied the song's release. Encompassing a number of [[Easter egg (media)|easter eggs]], the colorful video is a symbolic departure from the previous album ''[[Reputation (Taylor Swift album)|Reputation]]'' (2017), welcoming into the ''Lover'' era. It has been described as a "[[Phantasmagoria|phantasmagorical]] delight" that induces an instant "sugar rush" in a "bubblegum [[psychedelia]]". The video amassed over 65.2 million views within its first day of release, breaking the [[24-Hour Vevo Record|24-hour Vevo record]] previously held by [[Ariana Grande]]'s "[[Thank U, Next (song)|Thank U, Next]]", also surpassing Swift's personal record set in 2017 with the "[[Look What You Made Me Do]]" music video, which garnered 43.2 million views in its first day. The video scored several accolades; it won a [[Video Music Awards|VMA]] for [[MTV Video Music Award for Best Visual Effects|Best Visual Effects]] at the [[2019 MTV Video Music Awards]], the [[MTV Europe Music Award for Best Video|Best Video]] at the [[2019 MTV Europe Music Awards]] and the Best Female International Artist Video at the [[2019 MTV Video Music Awards Japan]].

The video also broke Swift's personal record set in 2017 with the "[[Look What You Made Me Do]]" music video, which garnered 43.2 million views on August 28, 2017. The music video also became the most-viewed video in 24 hours by female artist, a record that was later surpassed by [[Blackpink]]'s "[[How You Like That]]" video in June 2020.

Swift has stated that there are multiple [[Easter egg (media)|Easter eggs]] in the video, and that there are three levels of them in the video, from most obvious to least obvious, which point to clues about the upcoming album, single, and tour. It was revealed that "[[You Need to Calm Down]]", a line Urie says to Swift at the beginning in French, would be the second single, and an "old-timey, 1940s-sounding instrumental version" of the song plays in the background in the same scene.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.vogue.com/article/taylor-swift-cover-september-2019|title=Taylor Swift on Sexism, Scrutiny, and Standing Up for Herself|first=Abby|last=Aguirre|magazine=Vogue|date=August 8, 2019|accessdate=August 10, 2019|archive-date=August 10, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190810081937/https://www.vogue.com/article/taylor-swift-cover-september-2019?verso=true|url-status=dead}}</ref> The album title ''[[Lover (album)|Lover]]''<ref>{{cite web |last=Iasimone |first=Ashley |title=All the Easter Eggs in Taylor Swift's 'ME!'

=== Synopsis ===
[[File:Taylor Swift & Brendon Urie - Me! (music video screenshot).png|thumb|Swift sits on a unicorn-shaped eave as the dress turns into a waterfall. The word "Lover" in the background was an example of [[Easter egg (media)|Easter eggs]] that Swift placed in the video, as it was later revealed to be the [[Lover (album)|album title]].]]
The setting of the video seems to be set within a [[chrysalis]].<ref name="mv-bbc" /> The music video opens with a snake slithering on a floor which then explodes into a group of colourful butterflies, a probable benchmark to note the end of her previous era, ''[[Reputation (Taylor Swift album)|Reputation]]'', where snakes were a motif, and welcoming the inception of the upcoming one.<ref name="mv-bbc">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-48063952|title=All the references in Taylor Swift's Me! video|last=Savage|first=Mark|work=[[BBC]]|date=April 26, 2019|accessdate=May 14, 2019|archive-date=May 2, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190502033322/https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-48063952|url-status=live}}</ref> The video pans up to show Swift and Urie engaging in an argument in French, with subtitles provided, in an apartment unit, in which Swift refers to her cats Meredith and Olivia as her "daughters". Swift is wearing a black and white tule dress with floral accents. Swift then leaves the room without Urie and starts singing the song upon closing the door in the hallway. Swift walks down the hallway, and the camera briefly cuts onto a group of framed artwork hung on the apartment of chicks in sunglasses and a portrait of [[The Chicks]] during the line "and there's a lot of cool chicks out there". Swift is then seen walking to the lobby accompanied with several thunderclouds, one of which is in the form of a snake that tries to swallow her up but turns to dust upon doing so. The video cuts to a scene where a suit-clad Swift dances with her backup dancers, who are holding office bags. Urie looks out onto the street from the apartment and jumps down the balcony on an umbrella [[Mary Poppins (character)|Mary Poppins]]-style wearing a floral print suit.

He lands on the roof of a building with a unicorn-shaped [[eave]], where Swift is seen sitting at the edge with a pink dress that turns to a waterfall. This is where the ''Lover'' sign is spotted. Urie then tries and fails to win Swift over with classic and banal items such as a bouquet of flowers and a ring. He then awes her by presenting a cat, which Taylor later adopted as her third pet and named Benjamin Button. The camera cuts to Urie opening his heart, which is revealed to be a [[kaleidoscope]]. Swift has revealed on an [[Instagram]] [[live streaming|livestream]] that this is a reference to her 2014 song, "[[Welcome to New York (song)|Welcome to New York]]", where she sings "kaleidoscope of loud heartbeats under coats".<ref name="instagram-live">{{cite web|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/ryanschocket2/10-things-we-learned-from-taylor-swift-and-brendon-uries|title=10 Things We Learned From Taylor Swift And Brendon Urie's Instagram Live|work=[[BuzzFeed]]|last=Schocket|first=Ryan|date=April 28, 2019|accessdate=May 14, 2019|archive-date=May 14, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190514105248/https://www.buzzfeed.com/ryanschocket2/10-things-we-learned-from-taylor-swift-and-brendon-uries|url-status=live}}</ref> Urie and Swift then sing on a heart-shaped pinkish-orange stage, joined with a band of angels and go-go dancers wearing 1960s mod style clothing. As the bridge plays, Swift and Urie don blue marching band uniforms and dance with a group of dancers in the same attire, but pink. The video then cuts to a scene of the duo dancing on a floating window with a psychedelic-esque background. The last scene then depicts Swift in a blue attire that melts into what seems to be liquid bubblegum while a running Urie summons the same rain-like pastel liquid around the street. The video ends with the duo entering the same apartment building with an umbrella as the bubblegum rain continues on the street in the night.

In her [[Netflix]] docmentary ''[[Miss Americana]]'', Swift describes the concept of the music video to be related the song's message of individualism and self-empowerment by demonstrating hobbies and characteristics that make herself and Urie unique: [[emo]] kids and musical theatre for Urie and cats, gay pride, and cowboy boots for Swift.{{cn||date=July 2020}}
