==History==

The first mention of the town is in 1158. Ksniatyn was named after Kostiantyn Stroslavich, a [[boyar]] and general of [[Yaroslav Osmomysl]]. The town was given the [[Magdeburg Rights]] in 1448. As a result of the first of [[Partitions of Poland]] (Treaty of St-Petersburg dated 5 July 1772, Sniatyn (and Galicia) was attributed to the Habsburg Monarchy.<ref>Atlas des peuples d'Europe centrale, André et Jean Sellier, 1991, p.88</ref>

In 1939 Sniatyn was the temporary seat of American embassy in Poland, as the diplomatic personnel abandoned Warsaw after the first German Nazi bombings.

Nearly all of Sniatyn's [[Jewish]] population was murdered during the [[Holocaust]].  Many were shot and buried in the local forest.  Some died from disease and starvation in the ghetto.  Approximately 1,500 people were sent to [[Belzec extermination camp|Belzec]].
