'''Parole''' is the early release of a [[prisoner]] who agrees to abide by certain conditions, originating from the French word ''[[wikt:parole#French|parole]]'' ("speech, spoken words" but also "promise"). The term became associated during the [[Middle Ages]] with the release of prisoners who gave their word.

This differs greatly from [[pardon]], [[amnesty]] or [[commutation of sentence]] in that parolees are  still considered to be serving their sentences, and may be returned to prison if they violate the conditions of their parole.

==Development of modern parole==
[[Alexander Maconochie (penal reformer)|Alexander Maconochie]], a Scottish geographer and captain in the [[Royal Navy]], introduced the modern idea of parole when, in 1840, he was appointed superintendent of the British penal colonies in [[Norfolk Island]], Australia. He developed a plan to prepare them for eventual return to society that involved three grades. The first two consisted of promotions earned through good behaviour, labour, and study. The third grade in the system involved conditional liberty outside of prison while obeying rules. A violation would return them to prison and they would start all over again through the ranks of the three-grade process.<ref>{{cite book | author=Joel Samaha | title=Criminal Justice | publisher=[[Thomson/Wadsworth]] | place=Belmont, CA | date=2006 | isbn=9780534645571 | oclc=61362411 }}</ref><ref name=barry>John V.

In an instance of [[multiple discovery]], in 1846, [[Arnould Bonneville de Marsangy]] proposed the idea of parole (which he termed "preparatory liberations") to the Civil Tribunal at [[Reims]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Normandeau |first=André |title=Pioneers in Criminology: Arnould Bonneville de Marsangy (1802-1894) |journal=[[The Journal of Criminal Law, Criminology, and Police Science]] |year=1969 |publisher=[[Northwestern University School of Law]] |volume=60 |issue=1 |pages=28–32 |doi=10.2307/1141732 |jstor=1141732 |url=http://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=5565&context=jclc |quote=Historical innovations are often created independently and almost simultaneously. This seems to be the case about the origins of parole, especially in view of factors of time and means of communication. In effect, Maconochie developed his scheme in the years 1840-1844 as governor of Norfolk Island, a famous penal colony east of Australia, whereas Bonneville's ideas came out in the years 1846-1847. Our knowledge of the slowness of communications at the time, especially in such a sector of activity, leaves us with the impression that Bonneville really did not know about Maconochie's proposal.}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Twenty-Third Annual Report of the Executive Committee of the Prison Association of New York for 1867 |date=January 29, 1868 |publisher=C.

==Canada==
In general, in Canada, prisoners are eligible to [[Parole Board of Canada|apply for full parole]] after serving one-third of their sentences.<ref>{{cite web|date=12 March 2019|title=Types of Release - Fact Sheet|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/parole-board/corporate/publications-and-forms/types-of-release-fact-sheet.html|access-date=8 November 2020|website=Government of Canada}}</ref> Prisoners are also eligible to apply for [[day parole]],<ref>{{Cite web|date=2014-12-01|title=Types of Release|url=http://www.csc-scc.gc.ca/parole/002007-0003-eng.shtml|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130628193359/http://www.csc-scc.gc.ca/parole/002007-0003-eng.shtml|archive-date=June 28, 2013|access-date=2016-07-06|publisher=Correctional Services Canada}}</ref> and can do this before being eligible to apply for full parole.

Any prisoner whose sentence is less than two years is sent to a correctional [[Provincial correctional services in Canada|facility in the province or territory where they were convicted]], whilst anyone sentenced to serve no less than two years will be sent to a [[Correctional Service of Canada|federal correctional facility]] and will thus have to deal with the [[Parole Board of Canada]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.csc-scc.gc.ca/media-room/009-0002-eng.shtml |title=Frequently Asked Questions|website=Correctional Service Canada }}</ref>

Parole is an option for most prisoners. However, parole is not guaranteed, particularly for prisoners serving life or indeterminate sentences. In cases of first-degree murder, one can apply for parole after 25 years if convicted of a single murder. However, if convicted of multiple murders, either of the first or second-degree, the sentencing judge has the discretion to make parole ineligibility periods consecutive - thereby extending parole ineligibility beyond 25 years and, in rare cases, beyond a normal life-span.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.nationalpost.com/2014/10/31/justin-bourque-gets-unprecedented-five-life-sentences-for-moncton-shootings/|title=Justin Bourque handed harshest sentence since Canada's last execution more than 50 years ago|first=Michael|last=MacDonald|date=31 October 2014|work=[[National Post]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalpost.com/news/canada/winnipeg-killing-machine-who-targeted-homeless-men-gets-three-life-sentences-no-parole|title=Winnipeg 'killing machine' who targeted homeless men gets three life sentences, no parole|date=28 June 2016|website=nationalpost.com|access-date=15 April 2018}}</ref>

==China==
In [[China]], prisoners are often granted medical parole or [[compassionate release]], which releases them on the grounds that they must receive medical treatment which cannot be provided for in prison. Occasionally, medical parole is used as a less public way of releasing a wrongly convicted prisoner.<ref>{{cite news|title=China Grants Convicted Scholars Medical Parole|newspaper=[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]]|url=http://chronicle.com/weekly/v47/i47/47a04501.htm|url-status=dead|access-date=2008-01-13|archive-url=http://archive.today/2012.07.16-003850/http://chronicle.com/article/China-Grants-Convicted/6081|archive-date=July 16, 2012}}</ref><!-- 404

The Chinese legal code has no explicit provision for exile, but often dissidents are released on the grounds that they need to be treated for a medical condition in another country, and with the understanding that they will be reincarcerated if they return to China. Dissidents who have been released on medical parole include [[Ngawang Chophel]], [[Ngawang Sangdrol]], [[Phuntsog Nyidron]], [[Takna Jigme Zangpo]], [[Wang Dan (dissident)|Wang Dan]], [[Wei Jingsheng]], [[Gao Zhan (alleged spy)|Gao Zhan]] and [[Fang Lizhi]].

== Israel ==
Until 2001, parole in Israel was possible only after the prisoner had served two thirds of their sentence. On 13 February 2001 the [[Knesset]] passed a bill, brought forward by [[Reuven Rivlin]] and [[David Libai]], which allowed the early release of prisoners who had served half of their prison term (the so-called "Deri Law"<ref>{{cite web |last1=Kra |first1=Baruch |title=Will Deri Benefit From the Deri Law'? |url=https://www.haaretz.com/1.5488524 |website=Haaretz |access-date=22 October 2019}}</ref>). The law was originally intended to help ease overcrowding in prisons.

==Italy==
{{main|Libertà condizionata}}
''Libertà condizionata'' is covered by Article 176 of the Italian Penal Code. A prisoner is eligible if he has served at least 30 months (or 26 years for life sentences), and the time remaining on his sentence is less than half the total (normally), a quarter of the total (if previously convicted or never convicted) or five years (for sentences greater than 7.5 years). In 2006, 21 inmates were granted ''libertà condizionata''.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

==New Zealand==
{{see also|New Zealand Parole Board}}
In New Zealand, inmates serving a short-term sentence (up to two years) are automatically released after serving half their sentence, without a parole hearing{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}. Inmates serving sentences of more than two years are normally seen by the New Zealand Parole Board after serving one-third of the sentence, although the judge at sentencing can make an order for a minimum non-parole period of up to two-thirds of the sentence. Inmates serving [[Life imprisonment in New Zealand|life sentence]]s usually serve a minimum of 10 years, or longer depending on the minimum non-parole period, before being eligible for parole.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.paroleboard.govt.nz/about-us/cases-and-eligibility.html |title=Cases and Eligibility |publisher=Paroleboard.govt.nz |access-date=2012-04-27 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120505131850/http://www.paroleboard.govt.nz/about-us/cases-and-eligibility.html |archive-date=2012-05-05 }}</ref> Parole is not an automatic right and it was declined in 71 percent of hearings in the year ending 30 June 2010.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.paroleboard.govt.nz/__data/assets/pdf_file/0011/477515/NZPB_Annual_Report_09_10.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-06-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004235056/http://www.paroleboard.govt.nz/__data/assets/pdf_file/0011/477515/NZPB_Annual_Report_09_10.pdf |archive-date=2011-10-04 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Many sentences include a specific non-parole period.

==United Kingdom==
{{See also|Parole Board for England and Wales|Parole Board for Scotland}}
The Parole Board in the UK is only involved in the release of prisoners with specific sentences. Indeterminate sentences (life imprisonment and [[imprisonment for public protection]]) are always handled by the Parole Board because they have no fixed release date. Some determinate or "fixed" sentences, such as extended determinate sentences, are also handled by the Parole Board, but for the majority of prisoners the Parole Board will not be involved in their release.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/guidance/our-work|title=An outline of the parole process|publisher=gov.uk|access-date=28 December 2019}}</ref>

The conditions of release are called a licence, and parole is called ''released on licence''. There are seven standard licence conditions for all prisoners:<ref>{{Cite news|last1=Gianquitto |first1=Lisa |last2=Rule |first2=Philip |date=1 February 2012 |title=Licences and Licence conditions |newspaper=InsideTime |url=https://insidetime.org/licences-and-licence-conditions/ |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/70FSHvnGT?url=https://insidetime.org/licences-and-licence-conditions/ |archive-date=17 June 2018 |url-status=live |df=dmy}}</ref><ref name="pblicence">{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/licence-conditions-and-how-the-parole-board-use-them|title=Licence Conditions and how the Parole Board use them|publisher=gov.uk|access-date=28 December 2019}}</ref>

# receive visits from the supervising officer in accordance with instructions given by the supervising officer;
# reside permanently at an address approved by the supervising officer and obtain the prior permission of the supervising officer for any stay of one or more nights at a different address;
# not undertake work, or a particular type of work, unless it is approved by the supervising officer and notify the supervising officer in advance of any proposal to undertake work or a particular type of work;
# not travel outside the United Kingdom, the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man except with the prior permission of your supervising officer or for the purposes of immigration deportation or removal.

When a prisoner does not have to have their release approved by the Parole Board, further "additional licence conditions" may be suggested by the Probation Service and set by prison governors.<ref name="NOMS">{{Cite web|title=Licence conditions, licences and licence and supervision notices |date=23 March 2015 |publisher=National Offender Management Service |url=https://www.justice.gov.uk/downloads/offenders/psipso/psi-2015/psi-12-2015-licences-conditions-supervision.pdf |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/70FRY3UOT?url=https://www.justice.gov.uk/downloads/offenders/psipso/psi-2015/psi-12-2015-licences-conditions-supervision.pdf |archive-date=17 June 2018 |url-status=live |df=dmy}}</ref> When the Parole Board is involved, the Probation Service may suggest additional conditions, but the Parole Board is responsible for determining which additional conditions will be added to the licence.<ref name="pblicence"/> If an offender breaks any of these conditions, they can be "recalled" or returned to prison.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/guide-to-probation/being-taken-back-to-prison|title=Being taken back to prison|publisher=gov.uk|access-date=28 December 2019}}</ref>

===Early history===
[[Penologist]] [[Zebulon Brockway]] introduced parole when he became superintendent of [[Elmira Correctional Facility|Elmira Reformatory]] in [[Elmira, New York]]. To manage prison populations and rehabilitate those incarcerated, he instituted a two-part strategy that consisted of indeterminate sentences and parole releases.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o0rjRPnO7K4C&q=history+of+parole&pg=PA408 |title=Criminal Justice - Joel Samaha - Google Books |isbn=9780534645571 |access-date=2012-04-27|last1=Samaha |first1=Joel |year=2006 }}</ref> This was significant in prison reform due to its implication that prisoners began their rehabilitation during incarceration, which would be recognizable by a [[parole board]].<ref name=":12">{{Cite journal|last1=Reitz|first1=Kevin R.|last2=Rhine|first2=Edward E.|date=2020-01-13|title=Parole Release and Supervision: Critical Drivers of American Prison Policy|url=https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-criminol-011419-041416|journal=Annual Review of Criminology|volume=3|issue=1|pages=281–298|doi=10.1146/annurev-criminol-011419-041416|issn=2572-4568|doi-access=free}}</ref> It also provided newfound emphasis on prisoners' protection from cruel and unusual punishment.

===Modern history===
In the United States, courts may specify in a sentence how much time must be served before a prisoner is eligible for parole. This is often done by specifying an indeterminate sentence of, say, "5 to 15 years", or "15 years to life". The latter type is known as an indeterminate life sentence; in contrast, a sentence of "life without the possibility of parole" is known as a determinate life sentence.<ref>''In re Jeanice D.'', [http://online.ceb.com/calcases/C3/28C3d210.htm 28 Cal. 3d 210] (1980) ("25 years to life" is indeterminate life sentence implying that minor convicted of first-degree murder was eligible for commitment to California Youth Authority rather than determinate life sentence which would require incarceration in regular prison).</ref>

On the federal level, Congress abolished parole in the [[Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984]] (Pub. L. No. 98-473 § 218(a)(5), 98 Stat. 1837, 2027 [repealing 18 U.S.C.A. § 4201 et seq.]). Federal prisoners may, however, earn a maximum of 54 days good time credit per year against their sentence (18 U.S.C.A. § 3624(b)). At the time of sentencing, the federal judge may also specify a post-imprisonment period of supervised release.<ref name="US-legal">{{Cite web|title=Supervised Release Law and Legal Definition |publisher=US Legal |url=https://definitions.uslegal.com/s/supervised-release/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100823060226/https://definitions.uslegal.com/s/supervised-release/ |archive-date=23 August 2010 |url-status=live |df=dmy}}</ref> The U.S. Parole Commission still has jurisdiction over parole for those prisoners convicted of felonies in the District of Columbia and who are serving their sentences there, as well as over certain federally incarcerated military and international prisoners.<ref>{{Cite web|title=United States Parole Commission |date=February 2012 |publisher=United States Department of Justice |url=https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/jmd/legacy/2013/10/18/fy13-uspc-justification.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160313033033/https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/jmd/legacy/2013/10/18/fy13-uspc-justification.pdf |archive-date=13 March 2016 |url-status=live |df=dmy}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|date=May 2003|title=History of the Federal Parole System|url=http://www.fedcure.org/information/TheHistoryOfTheFederalParoleSystem-2003.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171026004400/http://www.fedcure.org/information/TheHistoryOfTheFederalParoleSystem-2003.pdf|archive-date=26 October 2017|access-date=17 June 2018|publisher=United States Parole Commission|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

In most states, the decision of whether an inmate is paroled is vested in a paroling authority such as a parole board. Mere good conduct while incarcerated in and of itself does not necessarily guarantee that an inmate will be paroled. Other factors may enter into the decision to grant or deny parole, most commonly the establishment of a permanent residence and immediate, gainful employment or some other clearly visible means of self-support upon release (such as [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] if the prisoner is old enough to qualify). Many states now permit sentences of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole (such as for [[murder]] and [[espionage]]), and any prisoner not sentenced to either this or the [[death penalty]] will eventually have the [[right to petition]] for release (one state{{spaced ndash}}[[Alaska]]{{spaced ndash}}maintains neither the death penalty nor life imprisonment without parole as sentencing options).

Before being granted the privilege of parole, the inmate meets with members of the parole board and is interviewed, The parolee also has a psychological exam. The inmate must first agree to abide by the conditions of parole set by the paroling authority. While in prison, the inmate signs a parole certificate or contract. On this contract are the conditions that the inmate must follow. These conditions usually require the parolee to meet regularly with his or her parole officer or community corrections agent, who assesses the behavior and adjustment of the parolee and determines whether the parolee is violating any of his or her terms of release (typically these include being at home during certain hours which is called a curfew, maintaining steady employment, not [[wikt:Appendix:Glossary of legal terms#Abscond|absconding]], refraining from illicit drug use and, sometimes, abstaining from [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]]), attending drug or alcohol counseling, and having no contact with their victim. The inmate gives an address which is verified by parole officers as valid before the inmate is released to parole supervision.

Upon release, the parolee goes to a parole office and is assigned a parole officer.  Parole officers make unannounced visits to parolees' houses or apartments to check on them. During these home visits officers look for signs of drug or alcohol use, guns or illegal weapons, and other illegal activities. Should parolees start to use drugs or alcohol, they are told to go to drug or alcohol counseling and [[Narcotics Anonymous]] or [[Alcoholics Anonymous]] meetings. Should they not comply with conditions on the parole certificate (including [[Felony disenfranchisement in the United States|abstention from voting]]) a warrant is issued for their arrest. Their parole time is stopped when the warrant is issued and starts only after they are arrested. They have a [[Morrissey Hearing|parole violation hearing]] within a specified time, and then a decision is made by the parole board to revoke their parole or continue the parolee on parole. In some cases, a parolee may be discharged from parole before the time called for in the original sentence if it is determined that the parole restrictions are no longer necessary for the protection of society (this most frequently occurs when elderly parolees are involved).

Service members who commit crimes while in the [[US military|U.S. military]] may be subject to [[court martial]] proceedings under the [[Uniform Code of Military Justice]] (UCMJ). If found guilty, they may be sent to [[Federal prison|federal]] or [[military prisons]] and upon release may be supervised by U.S. [[Federal Probation]] officers.

Parole in the United States has proven to be politically divisive. Beginning from the initiation of [[War on drugs|the war on drugs]] in the 1970s, politicians began to advertise their “tough on crime” stances, encouraging a tightening of penal policy and resulting in longer sentences for what were previously referred to as minor drug violations.<ref name=":2">{{Cite journal|last=Angle|first=Roland E.|date=2014|title=Build a Mass Movement: Abolish the Probation & Parole Systems to Attack the Foundation of the U.S. Police State|journal=Race, Gender & Class|volume=21|issue=1/2|pages=236–245|issn=1082-8354|jstor=43496972}}</ref> During elections, politicians whose administrations parole any large number of prisoners (or, perhaps, one notorious criminal) are typically attacked by their opponents as being "soft on crime". According to the [[U.S. Department of Justice]], at least sixteen states have removed the option of parole entirely, and four more have abolished parole for certain violent offenders.<ref>{{Cite news|date=17 August 1997|title=Quality of snitches declining as result of sentencing laws|page=6|newspaper=Arizona Republic}}</ref><ref>{{Cite magazine|date=2 May 2007|title=Parole system in transition assailed as unfair|url=http://www.newsday.com/news/local/wire/newyork/ny-bc-ny--parolequestioned0505may05,0,1199416.story|magazine=Newsday|df=dmy}}{{Dead link|date=June 2018}}</ref> However, during the rise of mass incarceration in the 1970s, the states that continued to use parole and indeterminate sentencing contributed more to rising incarceration rates than those without parole boards. Said states implemented a dramatic decrease of parole releases, which inevitably resulted in longer sentences for more prisoners. From 1980 to 2009, indeterminate sentencing states made up nine of the ten states with the highest incarceration rate.<ref name=":12"/>

Starting in the 1980s, parole was revisited as a method once again to manage prison populations and as financial motivation to prevent further budget straining. The new approach to parole release was accompanied with the growth of a [[mass surveillance]] state. The supervision practices of increased drug testing, intensive supervision, unannounced visits and home confinement are widely used today.<ref name=":12" /> Additionally, a growing condition of parole was to assume the role of informant towards frequently surveilled communities.<ref name=":3">{{Cite journal|last=SCHOENFELD|first=HEATHER|date=2016|title=A Research Agenda on Reform: Penal Policy and Politics across the States|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/24756113|journal=The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science|volume=664|pages=155–174|doi=10.1177/0002716215601850|jstor=24756113|s2cid=155248074|issn=0002-7162}}</ref>

The [[Great Recession in the United States|Great Recession]] of 2008 coupled with the [[September 11 attacks|Twin Towers attack]] on September 11, 2001 contributed to the public emphasis on the [[war on terror]] and eventually led to a trend of lowering incarceration. In fact, presidential politics between 2001 and 2012 were, for the first time in ten years, not focused on domestic crime control and even saw the promotion of the [[Second Chance Act (2007)|Second Chance Act]] by George W. Bush, who used the act to pledge federal money for reentry as a symbol of his "compassionate conservatism".<ref name=":3" />

=== Debates and reform efforts on parole ===
Since the 1990s, parole and indeterminate sentencing have been the focus of debate in the United States with some emphasizing reform of the parole system and others calling for its abolishment altogether. These debates are fueled by a growing scholarship that criticizes U.S. parole boards and also the parole system more broadly.

Parole boards themselves are seen as lacking in efficient qualifications and too politicized in the appointment process.<ref name=":3" /> The decision for granting parole has been criticized for neglecting the due process of prisoners on a case-by-case basis.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Reingold|first=Paul|date=2017|title=From Grace to Grids: Rethinking Due Process Protection for Parole|url=https://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=7602&context=jclc|journal=Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology|volume=107|pages=213–251}}</ref> Additionally, the process for being granted a commutation has been criticized, as many prisoners have been denied a commutation for not showing the right amount of "remorse" or proving substantially that they were ready to contribute again, which are aspects that many argue are too normative and subjective.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=De Giorgi|first=Alessandro|date=2017|title=Back to Nothing: Prisoner Reentry and Neoliberal Neglect|journal=Social Justice|volume=44|pages=83–120|via=ProQuest}}</ref>

Most agree that, as was originally intended, the parole system puts a necessary focus on rehabilitation, despite its current problems which are widely debated. Critics note that it is becoming more and more expensive to the taxpayer, with little evidence of successful rehabilitation for prisoners. The conditions of parole themselves are often attacked as well, critiqued for being overwhelmingly criminogenic and perpetuating mass surveillance and a permanent state of imprisonment that does little to ensure a smooth reentry into society.<ref name=":2" /> Critics note that greater discretion is required to decide which parolees requite costly supervisory resources and which ones do not, rather than placing digital, physical, and structural restrictions on every parolee.<ref name=":12" />

The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) stated in 2005 that about 45% of parolees completed their sentences successfully, while 38% were returned to prison, and 11% absconded. These statistics, the DOJ says, are relatively unchanged since 1995; even so, some states (including [[New York (state)|New York]]) have abolished parole altogether for violent felons, and the federal government abolished it in 1984 for all offenders convicted of a federal crime, whether violent or not. Despite the decline in jurisdictions with a functioning parole system, the average annual growth of parolees was an increase of about 1.6% per year between 1995 and 2002.

A variant of parole is known as "[[time off for good behavior]]", or, colloquially, "good time". Unlike the traditional form of parole{{spaced ndash}}which may be granted or denied at the discretion of a parole board{{spaced ndash}}time off for good behavior is automatic absent a certain number (or gravity) of infractions committed by a convict while incarcerated (in most jurisdictions the released inmate is placed under the supervision of a parole officer for a certain amount of time after being so released). In some cases "good time" can reduce the original sentence by as much as one-third. It is usually not made available to inmates serving life sentences, as there is no release date that can be moved up.

===Difference between parole and mandatory supervision===
Some states in the United States have what is known as "mandatory supervision", whereby an inmate is released before the completion of their sentence due to legal technicalities which oblige the offender justice system to free them. In the federal prison system,<ref>"[http://famm.org/projects/federal/us-congress/good-time-credit-for-federal-prisoners/ “Good Time Credit” for Federal Prisoners] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170614143028/http://famm.org/projects/federal/us-congress/good-time-credit-for-federal-prisoners/# |date=2017-06-14 }}." [[Families Against Mandatory Minimums]]. Retrieved on May 10, 2017.</ref> and in some states such as Texas, inmates are compensated with "[[good conduct time|good time]]", which is counted towards time served. For example, if an inmate served five years of a ten-year prison term, and also had five years of "good time", they will have completed their sentence "on paper", obliging the state to release them unless deemed a threat to society in writing by the parole board. Where parole is granted or denied at the discretion of a parole board, mandatory supervision does not involve a decision making process: one either qualifies for it or does not. Mandatory supervision tends to involve stipulations that are more lenient than those of parole, and in some cases place no obligations at all on the individual being released.

===US immigration law===

In US [[immigration law]], the term ''parole'' has two meanings related to allowing persons to enter or leave the United States without the normally required documentation.

==Impact==
According to a review of the academic literature by economist [[Jennifer Doleac]], reductions in parole supervision was one of the most cost-effective ways to improve the reintegration and rehabilitation of the formerly-incarcerated.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Doleac|first=Jennifer L.|date=2018-07-02|title=Study after study shows ex-prisoners would be better off without intense supervision|url=https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2018/07/02/study-after-study-shows-ex-prisoners-would-be-better-off-without-intense-supervision/|access-date=2020-08-03|website=Brookings|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Doleac|first=Jennifer L.|date=2018-06-16|title=Strategies to Productively Reincorporate the Formerly-Incarcerated into Communities: A Review of the Literature|url=https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=3198112|language=en|location=Rochester, NY|ssrn=3198112}}</ref>

==Prisoners of war==
Parole is "the agreement of persons who have been taken prisoner by an enemy that they will not again take up arms against those who captured them, either for a limited time or during the continuance of the war."<ref>2 Bouvier's Law Dictionary 2459 (1914)</ref> The [[US Department of Defense]] defines parole more broadly: "Parole agreements are promises given the captor by a [[POW]] to fulfill stated conditions, such as not to bear arms or not to escape, in consideration of special privileges, such as release from captivity or lessened restraint."<ref>US Department of Defense Directive 1300.7, Training and Education Measures Necessary to Support the Code of Conduct (23 December 88).</ref>

The practice of paroling enemy troops began thousands of years ago, at least as early as the time of [[Carthage]].<ref>Herbert C. Fooks, Prisoners of War 297 (1924).</ref> Parole allowed the prisoners' captors to avoid the burdens of having to feed and care for them while still avoiding having the prisoners rejoin their old ranks once released; it could also allow the captors to recover their own men in a [[prisoner exchange]]. [[Hugo Grotius]], an early international lawyer, favorably discussed prisoner of war parole.<ref>[[Hugo Grotius]], ''[[De Jure Belli ac Pacis]]'' (1625), reprinted in 2 Classics of International Law 853-54 (J. Scott ed. 1925).</ref> During the [[American Civil War]], both the [[Dix–Hill Cartel]] and the [[Lieber Code]] set out rules regarding prisoner of war parole.<ref>[[James M. McPherson]], ''[[Battle Cry of Freedom (book)|Battle Cry of Freedom]]'' 791 (1988); U.S. Army General Orders No. 100 (24 April 1863), reprinted in R. S. Hartigan, Lieber's Code and the Law of War 45–71 (1983).</ref> [[Francis Lieber]]'s thoughts on parole later reappeared in the Declaration of Brussels of 1874, the [[Hague Conventions (1899 and 1907)|Hague Convention]], and the Geneva Convention Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War.<ref>Annex to Hague Convention IV Respecting the Laws and Customs of War on Land, Art. 10 (1907) and Geneva Convention Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War, Art. 21 (1949), both reprinted in Documents on the Laws of War 216 (A. Roberts & R. Guelff (ed.), 1982).</ref>

In the United States, current policy prohibits US military personnel who are prisoners of war from accepting parole. The [[Code of the United States Fighting Force]] states: "I will accept neither parole nor special favors from the enemy."<ref>Code of Conduct for Members of the Armed Forces of the United States, Exec. Order No. 10,631, 20 Fed. Reg. 6057, 3 C.F.R. 1954–58 Comp. 266 (1955), as amended by Exec. Order No. 12,017, 42 Fed. Reg. 57941 (1977); and Exec. Order No. 12,633, 53 Fed. Reg. 10355 (1988).</ref> The position is reiterated by the Department of Defense. "The United States does not authorize any Military Service member to sign or enter into any such parole agreement."<ref>DoD Directive 1300.7, Enclosure 2, Para. B3a(5).</ref>
