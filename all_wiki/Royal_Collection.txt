The '''Royal Collection''' of the [[British Royal family]] is the largest private art collection in the world.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2002/nov/21/art.artsfeatures1|title=Kindness of strangers|author=Stuart Jeffries|date=21 November 2002|accessdate=15 July 2016|work=The Guardian}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/style/article191927.ece|newspaper=The Sunday Times|date=2 April 2006|title=The great British art swindle|author=Jerry Brotton|author-link1=Jerry Brotton|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161202035905/http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/style/article191927.ece|archive-date=2 December 2016|quote=Some people know that this is perhaps the finest, and certainly what the royal palaces website proudly calls "the largest private collection of art in the world".}}</ref>

Spread among 13 occupied and historic [[List of British royal residences|royal residences]] in the United Kingdom, the collection is owned by [[Elizabeth&nbsp;II]] and overseen by the [[Royal Collection Trust]]. The Queen owns some of the collection in right of [[the Crown]] and some as a private individual. It is made up of over one million objects,<ref name="faqs">{{cite web|url=https://www.royalcollection.org.uk/about/frequently-asked-questions|title=FAQs about the Royal Collection|publisher=Royal Collection Trust|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160404032434/https://www.royalcollection.org.uk/about/frequently-asked-questions|archive-date=4 April 2016}}</ref> including 7,000 paintings, over 150,000 works on paper,<ref>[https://www.rct.uk/about/working-for-us/our-roles/curating/jeremy-curator-of-prints-and-drawings "Jeremy, Curator of Prints and Drawings"], RC website</ref> this including 30,000 [[watercolour]]s and drawings,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/theroyalfamily/11412879/Secrets-of-the-Queens-paintings.html|title=Secrets of the Queen's paintings|work=The Telegraph|date=15 February 2015|accessdate=21 March 2016}}</ref> and about 450,000 photographs,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rct.uk/collection/about-the-collection/photographs|title=About the Collection: Photographs|website=Royal Collection Trust|accessdate=4 March 2019}}</ref> as well as tapestries, furniture, ceramics, textiles, carriages, weapons, armour, jewellery, clocks, musical instruments, tableware, plants, manuscripts, books, and sculptures.

Some of the buildings which house the collection, like [[Hampton Court Palace]], are open to the public and not lived in by the Royal Family, whilst others, like [[Windsor Castle]] and [[Kensington Palace]], are both residences and open to the public. The [[Queen's Gallery]] at [[Buckingham Palace]] in London was built specially to exhibit pieces from the collection on a rotating basis. There is a similar [[Queen's Gallery, Edinburgh|art gallery]] next to the [[Palace of Holyroodhouse]] in [[Edinburgh]], and a Drawings Gallery at [[Windsor Castle]]. The [[Crown Jewels of the United Kingdom|Crown Jewels]] are on public display in the [[Jewel House]] at the [[Tower of London]].

About 3,000 objects are on loan to museums throughout the world, and many others are lent on a temporary basis to exhibitions.<ref name="faqs"/>

==History==
Few items from before [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] survive. The most important additions were made by [[King Charles I of England|Charles I]], a passionate collector of Italian paintings and a major patron of [[Van Dyck]] and other Flemish artists. He purchased the bulk of the [[Gonzaga collection]] from the [[Duchy of Mantua]]. The entire Royal Collection, which included 1,500 paintings and 500 statues,<ref name="newstatesman">{{cite web|url=https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/art-design/2018/01/cavalier-collector-how-charles-i-gained-and-lost-some-world-s-best-art|title=The cavalier collector: how Charles I gained (and lost) some of the world's best art|author=Michael Prodger|website=New Statesman|date=22 January 2018|accessdate=4 March 2019}}</ref> was sold after Charles's execution in 1649. The 'Sale of the Late King's Goods' at [[Somerset House]] raised £185,000 for the [[English Republic]]. Other items were given away in lieu of payment to settle the king's debts.<ref name="prodger">{{cite magazine|title=The Royals' Treasures|author=Michael Prodger|magazine=Culture|publisher=The Sunday Times|date=17 December 2017|pages=44–45}}</ref> A number of pieces were recovered by [[King Charles II of England|Charles II]] after the [[English Restoration|Restoration]] of the monarchy in 1660, and they form the basis for the collection today. The [[Dutch Republic]] also presented Charles with the [[Dutch Gift]] of 28 paintings, 12 sculptures, and a selection of furniture. He went on to buy many paintings and other works.

[[File:Johannes Vermeer - Lady at the Virginal with a Gentleman, 'The Music Lesson' - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright=1.14|[[Johannes Vermeer]], ''[[The Music Lesson]]'', {{circa|1660}}, was acquired by George&nbsp;III in 1762.<ref>{{Royal Collection|405346|Lady at the Virginals with a Gentleman}}</ref>]]

[[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]] was mainly responsible for forming the collection's outstanding holdings of [[Old Master]] drawings; large numbers of these, and many Venetian paintings including over 40 [[Canaletto]]s, joined the collection when he bought the collection of Joseph "[[Consul Smith]]", which also included a large number of books.<ref>Lloyd (1991), 143, 164, 166</ref>  Many other drawings were bought from [[Alessandro Albani]], cardinal and art dealer in Rome.<ref>[https://www.rct.uk/collection/people/george-iii-king-of-the-united-kingdom-1738-1820#/type/subject "George III"], Royal Collection</ref>

[[George IV of the United Kingdom|George IV]] shared Charles I's enthusiasm for collecting, buying up large numbers of [[Dutch Golden Age painting]]s and their Flemish contemporaries.  Like other English collectors, he took advantage of the great quantities of French decorative art on the London market after the [[French Revolution]], and is mostly responsible for the collection's outstanding holdings of 18th-century French furniture and porcelain, especially [[Manufacture nationale de Sèvres|Sèvres]].  He also bought much contemporary English silver, and many recent and contemporary English paintings.<ref>[https://www.rct.uk/collection/people/george-iv-king-of-the-united-kingdom-1762-1830#/type/subject "King George IV"], Royal Collection; Lloyd (1991), 143</ref> [[Queen Victoria]] and her husband [[Albert, Prince Consort|Albert]] were keen collectors of contemporary and [[old master]] paintings. 

Many objects have been given from the collection to museums, especially by George&nbsp;III and Victoria and Albert. In particular, the [[King's Library]] formed by George III with the assistance of his librarian [[Frederick Augusta Barnard]], consisting of 65,000 printed books, was given to the [[British Museum]], now the [[British Library]], where they remain as a distinct collection.<ref>[https://www.bl.uk/collection-guides/the-kings-library "The King's Library], [[British Library]]</ref>  He also donated the "Old Royal Library" of some 2,000 manuscripts, which are still segregated as the [[Royal manuscripts, British Library|Royal manuscripts]].<ref>[https://www.bl.uk/collection-guides/royal-manuscripts "Royal manuscripts"], [[British Library]]</ref>  The core of this collection was the purchase by [[James I of England|James&nbsp;I]] of the related collections of [[Humphrey Llwyd]], [[John Lumley, 1st Baron Lumley|Lord Lumley]], and the [[Henry FitzAlan, 19th Earl of Arundel|Earl of Arundel]].<ref name=ODNB>R. Brinley Jones, ‘[[Llwyd, Humphrey (1527–1568)]]’, [[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]], Oxford University Press, Sept 2004</ref>  Prince Albert's will requested the donation of a number of mostly early paintings to the [[National Gallery, London]], which Queen Victoria fulfilled.<ref>[https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/research/prince-albert-and-the-gallery "Prince Albert and the Gallery"], National Gallery</ref>

===Modern era===
Throughout the reign of [[Elizabeth II]] (1952–present), there have been significant additions to the collection through judicious purchases, bequests, and gifts from nation states and official bodies.<ref>Sir Hugh Roberts in Roberts, pp. 25 and 391.</ref> Since 1952, approximately 2,500 works have been added to the Royal Collection.<ref name="prodger"/> The [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] is strongly represented in this manner: an example is 75 contemporary Canadian [[watercolours]] that entered the collection between 1985 and 2001 as a gift from the [[Canadian Society of Painters in Water Colour]].<ref>Jackson, p. 59.</ref> Modern art acquired by Elizabeth II includes pieces by Sir [[Anish Kapoor]] and [[Andy Warhol]].<ref name="prodger"/>

In 1987 a new department of the [[Royal Household]] was established to oversee the Royal Collection, and it was financed by the commercial activities of Royal Collection Enterprises, a [[limited company]]. Before then, it was maintained using the monarch's official income paid by the [[Civil List]]. Since 1993 the collection has been funded by entrance fees to Windsor Castle and Buckingham Palace.<ref>Hall, p. 660.</ref>

A computerised inventory of the collection was started in early 1991,<ref>{{Cite Hansard |jurisdiction=United Kingdom |house=House of Commons |title=Works of Art | url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1993/jan/11/works-of-art#S6CV0216P0_19930111_CWA_132 |date=11 January 1993 |volume=216 |column=540W }}</ref> and it was completed in December 1997.<ref>{{Cite Hansard |jurisdiction=United Kingdom |house=House of Commons |title=Royal Collection | url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1998/jul/07/royal-collection#S6CV0315P0_19980707_CWA_49 |date=7 July 1998 |volume=315 |column=429W }}</ref> The full inventory is not available to the public, though catalogues of parts of the collection – especially paintings – have been published, and a searchable database on the Royal Collection website is increasingly comprehensive,<ref>Hardman, p. 102.</ref> with "271,697 items found" by late 2020.<ref>[https://www.rct.uk/collection/search#/page/1 "Explore the Collection"], Royal Collection, accessed 1 October 2020</ref>

About a third of the 7,000 paintings in the collection are on view or stored at buildings in London which fall under the remit of the [[Historic Royal Palaces]] agency: the [[Tower of London]], [[Hampton Court Palace]], [[Kensington Palace]], [[Banqueting House, Whitehall|Banqueting House (Whitehall)]], and [[Kew Palace]].<ref>{{Cite Hansard |jurisdiction=United Kingdom |house=House of Commons |title=Art Collections|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1993/feb/19/art-collections#column_366w |date=19 February 1993 |volume=219 |column=366W }}</ref> The [[Jewel House]] and Martin Tower at the Tower of London also house the [[Crown Jewels of the United Kingdom|Crown Jewels]].

Some works are on long-term or permanent loan to museums and other places; the most famous of these are the [[Raphael Cartoons]], in the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] in London since 1865.<ref>Clayton and Whitaker, pp. 12 and 16.</ref>

===Paintings, prints and drawings===
The collection's holdings of Western fine art are among the largest and most important assemblages in existence, with works of the highest quality, and in many cases artists whose works cannot be fully understood without a study of the holdings contained within the Royal Collection.  There are over 7,000 paintings, spread across the Royal residences and palaces. The collection does not claim to provide a comprehensive, chronological survey of Western fine art but it has been shaped by the individual tastes of kings, queens and their families over the last 500 years.

The prints and drawings collection is based in the [[Print Room, Windsor]], and is exceptionally strong, with famous holdings of drawings by [[Leonardo da Vinci]] (550), [[Raphael]], [[Michelangelo]] and [[Hans Holbein the Younger]] (85).  A large part of the [[Old Master]] drawings were acquired by George III.<ref>{{cite web |title=Drawings, Watercolours, and Prints |url=https://www.rct.uk/collection/about-the-collection/drawings-watercolours-and-prints |website=Royal Collection Trust |access-date=16 November 2020}}</ref> Starting in early 2019, 144 of Leonardo daVinci's drawings from the Collection went on display in 12 locations in the UK.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rct.uk/collection/themes/exhibitions/leonardo-da-vinci-a-life-in-drawing-0 |title=LEONARDO DA VINCI: A LIFE IN DRAWING |date=8 February 2019 |publisher=RCT |access-date=29 November 2019 |quote=A nationwide celebration during 2019}}</ref> From May to October that year, 200 of the drawings were on display in the [[Queen's Gallery]] at [[Buckingham Palace]].<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/2019/05/leonardo-da-vinci-artistic-brilliance-endures-500-years-after-death/ |title=Leonardo da Vinci's Artistic Brilliance Endures 500 Years After His Death |date=1 May 2019 |magazine=National Geographic |url-access=subscription |access-date=29 November 2019 }}</ref>

===Costume===
The collection has a number of items of clothing, including those worn by members of the Royal family, especially female members, some going back to the early 19th century. These include ceremonial dress and several wedding dresses, including that of Queen Victoria (1840).<ref>[https://www.rct.uk/collection/search#/14/collection/71975/queen-victorias-wedding-dress "Queen Victoria's wedding dress, 1840"], Royal Collection</ref>  There are also servant's livery uniforms, and a number of exotic pieces presented over the years, going back to a "war coat" of [[Tipu Sultan]] (d. 1799).<ref>[https://www.rct.uk/collection/search#/11/collection/67213/war-coat-of-tipu-sultan "War coat of Tipu Sultan, 1785-90"], Royal Collection</ref>  In recent years these have featured more prominently in displays and exhibitions, and are popular with the public.

===Gems and Jewels===
A collection of 277 [[Cameo (carving)|cameo]]s, [[Engraved gem|intaglio]]s, badges of insignia, snuffboxes and pieces of jewellery known as the Gems and Jewels are kept at Windsor Castle. Separate from [[Elizabeth II's jewels]] and the Crown Jewels, 24 pre-date the [[Renaissance]] and the rest were made in the 16th–19th centuries. In 1862, it was first shown publicly at the South Kensington Museum, now the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]]. Several objects were removed and others added in the second half of the Victorian period. An inventory of the collection was made in 1872, and a catalogue, ''Ancient and Modern Gems and Jewels in the Collection of Her Majesty The Queen'', was published in 2008 by the Royal Collection Trust.<ref>Piacenti and Boardman, p. 11.</ref>

==Ownership==
The Royal Collection is privately owned, although some of the works are displayed in areas of palaces and other royal residences open to visitors for the public to enjoy.<ref>Lloyd, p. 11. "It is, therefore, a private collection, although its sheer size (some 7,000 pictures) and its display in palaces and royal residences (several of which are open to the public) give it a public dimension".</ref> Some of the collection is owned by the monarch personally,<ref>{{Cite Hansard |jurisdiction=United Kingdom |house=House of Commons |title=Royal Taxation|url=https://api.parliament.uk/historic-hansard/written-answers/2000/jun/07/royal-taxation#S6CV0351P0_20000607_CWA_212|date=7 June 2000 |volume=351 |column=273W |quote=There is a computerised inventory of the Royal Collection which identifies assets held by the Queen as Sovereign and as a private individual.}}</ref> and everything else is described as being held in trust by the monarch in right of [[the Crown]]. It is understood that works of art acquired by monarchs up to the death of [[Queen Victoria]] in 1901 are [[heirloom]]s which fall into the latter category. Items the [[British royal family]] acquired later, including official gifts,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/force-the-royal-family-to-declare-gifts-say-mps-7259318.html|title=Force the Royal Family to declare gifts, say MPs|date=30 January 2007|accessdate=26 November 2016|newspaper=Evening Standard|location=London}}</ref> can be added to that part of the collection by a monarch at his or her discretion. Ambiguity surrounds the status of objects that have come into the possession of [[Elizabeth II]] during her reign.<ref name="morton">Morton, p. 156.</ref> The [[Royal Collection Trust]] has confirmed that all pieces left to the Queen by the [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother|Queen Mother]], which include works by [[Monet]], [[Paul Nash (artist)|Nash]], and [[Fabergé]], belong to her personally.<ref>McClure, pp. 209–210.</ref> It has also been confirmed that she owns the [[Royal Philatelic Collection|Royal stamp collection]], inherited from her father George VI, as a private individual.<ref>McClure, p. 20.</ref>

Non-personal items are said to be [[Restraint on alienation|inalienable]] as they can only be willed to the monarch's successor. The legal accuracy of this claim has never been substantiated in court.<ref name="paxman">Paxman, p. 165.</ref> According to [[Cameron Cobbold]], then [[Lord Chamberlain]], speaking in 1971, minor items have occasionally been sold to help raise money for acquisitions, and duplicates of items are given away as presents within the Commonwealth.<ref name="morton"/> In 1995, [[Iain Sproat]], then [[Secretary of State for National Heritage]], told the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] that selling objects was "entirely a matter for the Queen".<ref>{{Cite Hansard |jurisdiction=United Kingdom |house=House of Commons |title=Ethiopian Manuscripts|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1995/jul/19/ethiopian-manuscripts#S6CV0263P2_19950719_CWA_1348|date=19 July 1995 |volume=263 |column=1463W }}</ref> In a 2000 television interview, the [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Duke of Edinburgh]] said that the Queen was "technically, perfectly at liberty to sell them".<ref name="guardian"/>

Hypothetical questions have been asked in [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] about what should happen to the collection if the UK ever becomes a [[republic]].<ref>{{Cite Hansard |jurisdiction=United Kingdom |house=House of Commons |title=Royal Finances |url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/westminster_hall/2002/jul/09/royal-finances#column_221wh |date=9 July 2002 |volume=388 |column=221WH }}</ref> In other European countries, the art collections of deposed monarchies usually have been taken into [[state ownership]] or become part of other national collections held in trust for the public's enjoyment.<ref>Lloyd, p. 12.</ref> Under the [[European Convention on Human Rights]], incorporated into British law in 1998, the monarch may have to be compensated for the loss of any assets held in right of the Crown unless he or she agreed to surrender them voluntarily.<ref>Cahill, p. 77.</ref>

==Management==
[[File:Royal Collection Trust.png|thumb|right|Royal Collection Trust]]

A registered charity, the '''Royal Collection Trust''' was set up in 1993 after the [[1992 Windsor Castle fire|Windsor Castle fire]] with a mandate to conserve the works and enhance the public's appreciation and understanding of art.<ref>Hardman, p. 43.</ref> It employs around 500 staff and is one of the five departments of the [[Royal Households of the United Kingdom|Royal Household]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.royalcollection.org.uk/about/working-for-us#/|title=Working for us|publisher=Royal Collection Trust|accessdate=21 March 2016}}</ref> Buildings do not come under its remit.
