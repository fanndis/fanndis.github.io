<!-- Clinical significance -->
Decreased or absent insulin activity results in diabetes mellitus, a condition of high blood sugar level (hyperglycaemia). There are two types of the disease. In [[Diabetes mellitus type 1|type 1 diabetes mellitus]], the beta cells are destroyed by an [[autoimmunity|autoimmune reaction]] so that insulin can no longer be synthesized or be secreted into the blood.<ref name="urlInsulin Injection - PubMed Health">{{cite web | url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0000729 | title = Insulin Injection  | author = American Society of Health-System Pharmacists  | date = 2009-02-01 | work = PubMed Health | publisher = National Center for Biotechnology Information, U.S. National Library of Medicine | access-date = 2012-10-12 }}</ref> In [[Diabetes mellitus type 2|type 2 diabetes mellitus]], the destruction of beta cells is less pronounced than in type 1 diabetes, and is not due to an autoimmune process. Instead, there is an accumulation of [[amyloid]] in the pancreatic islets, which likely disrupts their anatomy and physiology.<ref name=koeslag /> The [[pathogenesis]] of type 2 diabetes is not well understood but reduced population of islet beta-cells, reduced secretory function of islet beta-cells that survive, and peripheral tissue insulin resistance are known to be involved.<ref name="Biochemistry"/> Type 2 diabetes is characterized by increased glucagon secretion which is unaffected by, and unresponsive to the concentration of blood glucose. But insulin is still secreted into the blood in response to the blood glucose.<ref name=koeslag /> As a result, glucose accumulates in the blood.

<!-- Structure -->
The human insulin protein is composed of 51 [[amino acid]]s, and has a [[molecular mass]] of 5808 [[Dalton (unit)|Da]]. It is a hetero[[protein dimer|dimer]] of an A-chain and a B-chain, which are linked together by [[disulfide bond]]s. Insulin's structure varies slightly between [[species]] of animals. Insulin from animal sources differs somewhat in effectiveness (in [[carbohydrate metabolism]] effects) from human insulin because of these variations. [[Pig|Porcine]] insulin is especially close to the [[human]] version, and was widely used to treat type 1 diabetics before human insulin could be produced in large quantities by [[Recombinant DNA#Applications of recombinant DNA technology|recombinant DNA]] technologies.<ref name=recombination>Drug Information Portal NLM – Insulin human USAN http://druginfo.nlm.nih.gov/drugportal/</ref><ref name="urlGenentech">{{cite web|url=http://www.gene.com/media/press-releases/4160/1978-09-06/first-successful-laboratory-production-o|title=First Successful Laboratory Production of Human Insulin Announced | date=1978-09-06 |publisher=Genentech |work=News Release|access-date=2016-09-26}}</ref><ref name="urlRecombinant DNA technology in the synthesis of human insulin">{{cite web | url = http://www.littletree.com.au/dna.htm | title = Recombinant DNA technology in the synthesis of human insulin | author = Tof I  | year = 1994 | publisher = Little Tree Publishing | access-date = 2009-11-03 }}</ref><ref name="pmid23222785">{{cite journal | vauthors = Aggarwal SR | title = What's fueling the biotech engine-2011 to 2012 | journal = Nature Biotechnology | volume = 30 | issue = 12 | pages = 1191–7 | date = December 2012 | pmid = 23222785 | doi = 10.1038/nbt.2437 | s2cid = 8707897 }}</ref>

The amino acid sequence of insulin is [[conserved sequence|strongly conserved]] and varies only slightly between species. [[Cow|Bovine]] insulin differs from human in only three [[amino acid]] residues, and [[Pig|porcine]] insulin in one. Even insulin from some species of fish is similar enough to human to be clinically effective in humans. Insulin in some invertebrates is quite similar in sequence to human insulin, and has similar physiological effects. The strong homology seen in the insulin sequence of diverse species suggests that it has been conserved across much of animal evolutionary history. The C-peptide of [[proinsulin]], however, differs much more among species; it is also a hormone, but a secondary one.<ref name=":1" />

Insulin is produced and stored in the body as a hexamer (a unit of six insulin molecules), while the active form is the monomer. The hexamer is about 36000 Da in size. The six molecules are linked together as three dimeric units to form symmetrical molecule. An important feature is the presence of zinc atoms (Zn<sup>2+</sup>) on the axis of symmetry, which are surrounded by three water molecules and three histamine residues at position B10.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" />

The hexamer is an inactive form with long-term stability, which serves as a way to keep the highly reactive insulin protected, yet readily available. The hexamer-monomer conversion is one of the central aspects of insulin formulations for injection. The hexamer is far more stable than the monomer, which is desirable for practical reasons; however, the monomer is a much faster-reacting drug because diffusion rate is inversely related to particle size. A fast-reacting drug means insulin injections do not have to precede mealtimes by hours, which in turn gives people with diabetes more flexibility in their daily schedules.<ref name="pmid16158220">{{cite journal | vauthors = Dunn MF | title = Zinc-ligand interactions modulate assembly and stability of the insulin hexamer -- a review | journal = Biometals | volume = 18 | issue = 4 | pages = 295–303 | date = August 2005 | pmid = 16158220 | doi = 10.1007/s10534-005-3685-y | s2cid = 8857694 }}</ref> Insulin can aggregate and form [[fibrillar]] interdigitated [[beta-sheet]]s.

== Synthesis, physiological effects, and degradation ==

=== Synthesis ===
Insulin is produced in the [[pancreas]] and the Brockmann body (in some fish), and released when any of several stimuli are detected. These stimuli include the rise in plasma concentrations of amino acids and glucose resulting from the digestion of food.<ref name=MedicalPhysiology>{{cite book|last1=Rhoades|first1=Rodney A.|last2=Bell|first2=David R.| name-list-style = vanc | title=Medical physiology : principles for clinical medicine|date=2009|publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins|location=Philadelphia|isbn=978-0-7817-6852-8|pages=644–47|edition= 3rd}}</ref> [[Carbohydrate]]s can be polymers of simple sugars or the simple sugars themselves. If the carbohydrates include glucose, then that glucose will be absorbed into the bloodstream and blood glucose level will begin to rise. In target cells, insulin initiates a [[signal transduction]], which has the effect of increasing [[glucose]] uptake and storage. Finally, insulin is degraded, terminating the response.

Production and secretion are largely independent; prepared insulin is stored awaiting secretion. Both C-peptide and mature insulin are biologically active.

In mammals, insulin is synthesized in the pancreas within the beta cells. One million to three million pancreatic islets form the [[endocrine]] part of the pancreas, which is primarily an [[exocrine]] [[gland]]. The endocrine portion accounts for only 2% of the total mass of the pancreas. Within the pancreatic islets, beta cells constitute 65–80% of all the cells.{{citation needed|date=July 2020}}

Insulin consists of two polypeptide chains, the A- and B- chains, linked together by disulfide bonds. It is however first synthesized as a single polypeptide called [[preproinsulin]] in beta cells. Preproinsulin contains a 24-residue [[signal peptide]] which directs the nascent polypeptide chain to the rough [[endoplasmic reticulum]] (RER).  The signal peptide is cleaved as the polypeptide is translocated into lumen of the RER, forming [[proinsulin]].<ref>{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=ohgjG0qAvfgC&pg=PA66 |title= Joslin's Diabetes Mellitus | vauthors = Kahn CR, Weir GC | author-link = C.

Proinsulin undergoes maturation into active insulin through the action of cellular endopeptidases known as [[prohormone convertase]]s ([[Proprotein convertase 1|PC1]] and [[proprotein convertase 2|PC2]]), as well as the exoprotease [[carboxypeptidase E]].<ref name="pmid16591494">{{cite journal | vauthors = Steiner DF, Oyer PE | title = The biosynthesis of insulin and a probable precursor of insulin by a human islet cell adenoma | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 57 | issue = 2 | pages = 473–80 | date = February 1967 | pmid = 16591494 | pmc = 335530 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.57.2.473 | bibcode = 1967PNAS...57..473S }}</ref>  The endopeptidases cleave at 2 positions, releasing a fragment called the [[C-peptide]], and leaving 2 peptide chains, the B- and A- chains, linked by 2 disulfide bonds.

=== Release ===
{{See also|Blood glucose regulation}}

[[Beta Cell|Beta cells]] in the [[islets of Langerhans]] release insulin in two phases. The first-phase release is rapidly triggered in response to increased blood glucose levels, and lasts about 10 minutes. The second phase is a sustained, slow release of newly formed vesicles triggered independently of sugar, peaking in 2 to 3 hours. Reduced first-phase insulin release may be the earliest detectable beta cell defect predicting onset of [[Diabetes mellitus type 2|type&nbsp;2 diabetes]].<ref name="pmid11815469">{{cite journal | vauthors = Gerich JE | title = Is reduced first-phase insulin release the earliest detectable abnormality in individuals destined to develop type 2 diabetes? | journal = Diabetes | volume = 51 | issue = Suppl 1 | pages = S117–21 | date = February 2002 | pmid = 11815469 | doi = 10.2337/diabetes.51.2007.s117| doi-access = free }}</ref> First-phase release and [[Insulin resistance|insulin sensitivity]] are independent predictors of diabetes.<ref name="pmid20805282">{{cite journal | vauthors = Lorenzo C, Wagenknecht LE, Rewers MJ, Karter AJ, Bergman RN, Hanley AJ, Haffner SM | title = Disposition index, glucose effectiveness, and conversion to type 2 diabetes: the Insulin Resistance Atherosclerosis Study (IRAS) | journal = Diabetes Care | volume = 33 | issue = 9 | pages = 2098–103 | date = September 2010 | pmid = 20805282 | pmc = 2928371 | doi = 10.2337/dc10-0165 }}</ref>

The description of first phase release is as follows:
* Glucose enters the β-cells through the [[glucose transporters]], [[GLUT2]]. These glucose transporters have a relatively low affinity for glucose, ensuring that the rate of glucose entry into the β-cells is proportional to the extracellular glucose concentration (within the physiological range). At low blood sugar levels very little glucose enters the β-cells; at high blood glucose concentrations large quantities of glucose enter these cells.<ref name=schuit>{{cite journal | vauthors = Schuit F, Moens K, Heimberg H, Pipeleers D | title = Cellular origin of hexokinase in pancreatic islets | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 274 | issue = 46 | pages = 32803–09 | date = November 1999 | pmid = 10551841 | publication-date = 1999 | doi=10.1074/jbc.274.46.32803| doi-access = free }}</ref>
* The glucose that enters the β-cell is phosphorylated to [[glucose-6-phosphate]] (G-6-P) by [[glucokinase]] ([[Hexokinase#Types of mammalian hexokinase|hexokinase IV]]) which is not inhibited by G-6-P in the way that the hexokinases in other tissues (hexokinase I – III) are affected by this product. This means that the intracellular G-6-P concentration remains proportional to the blood sugar concentration.<ref name=koeslag /><ref name=schuit />
* Glucose-6-phosphate enters [[Glycolysis|glycolytic pathway]] and then, via the [[pyruvate dehydrogenase]] reaction, into the [[Krebs cycle]], where multiple, high-energy [[adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] molecules are produced by the oxidation of [[acetyl CoA]] (the Krebs cycle substrate), leading to a rise in the ATP:ADP ratio within the cell.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Schuit F, De Vos A, Farfari S, Moens K, Pipeleers D, Brun T, Prentki M | title = Metabolic fate of glucose in purified islet cells.

* An increased intracellular ATP:ADP ratio closes the ATP-sensitive SUR1/[[Kir6.2]] [[potassium channel]] (see [[sulfonylurea receptor]]). This prevents potassium ions (K<sup>+</sup>) from leaving the cell by facilitated diffusion, leading to a buildup of intracellular potassium ions. As a result, the inside of the cell becomes less negative with respect to the outside, leading to the depolarization of the cell surface membrane.
* Upon [[depolarization]], voltage-gated [[calcium channels|calcium ion (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) channels]] open, allowing calcium ions to move into the cell by facilitated diffusion.
* The cytosolic calcium ion concentration can also be increased by calcium release from intracellular stores via activation of ryanodine receptors.<ref name="SP2015">{{cite journal | vauthors = Santulli G, Pagano G, Sardu C, Xie W, Reiken S, D'Ascia SL, Cannone M, Marziliano N, Trimarco B, Guise TA, Lacampagne A, Marks AR | title = Calcium release channel RyR2 regulates insulin release and glucose homeostasis | journal = The Journal of Clinical Investigation | volume = 125 | issue = 5 | pages = 1968–78 | date = May 2015 | pmid = 25844899 | doi = 10.1172/JCI79273 | pmc=4463204}}</ref>
* The calcium ion concentration in the cytosol of the beta cells can also, or additionally, be increased through the activation of [[phospholipase|phospholipase C]] resulting from the binding of an extracellular [[ligand]] (hormone or neurotransmitter) to a [[G protein]]-coupled membrane receptor. Phospholipase C cleaves the membrane phospholipid, [[phosphatidyl inositol 4,5-bisphosphate]], into [[inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate]] and [[diglyceride|diacylglycerol]]. Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) then binds to receptor proteins in the plasma membrane of the [[endoplasmic reticulum]] (ER). This allows the release of Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions from the ER via IP3-gated channels, which raises the cytosolic concentration of calcium ions independently of the effects of a high blood glucose concentration. [[Parasympathetic nervous system|Parasympathetic]] stimulation of the pancreatic islets operates via this pathway to increase insulin secretion into the blood.<ref name=stryer1>{{cite book |last1= Stryer |first1= Lubert | name-list-style = vanc | title = Biochemistry. |edition=  Fourth |location= New York |publisher= W.H.

* The significantly increased amount of calcium ions in the cells' cytoplasm causes the release into the blood of previously synthesized insulin, which has been stored in intracellular [[secretion|secretory]] [[vesicle (biology)|vesicles]].

This is the primary mechanism for release of insulin. Other substances known to stimulate insulin release include the amino acids arginine and leucine, parasympathetic release of [[acetylcholine]] (acting via the phospholipase C pathway), [[sulfonylurea]], [[cholecystokinin]] (CCK, also via phospholipase C),<ref name="pmid19922535">{{cite journal | vauthors = Cawston EE, Miller LJ | title = Therapeutic potential for novel drugs targeting the type 1 cholecystokinin receptor | journal = British Journal of Pharmacology | volume = 159 | issue = 5 | pages = 1009–21 | date = March 2010 | pmid = 19922535 | pmc = 2839260 | doi = 10.1111/j.1476-5381.2009.00489.x }}</ref> and the gastrointestinally derived [[incretins]], such as [[glucagon-like peptide-1]] (GLP-1) and [[glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide]] (GIP).

Release of insulin is strongly inhibited by [[norepinephrine]] (noradrenaline), which leads to increased blood glucose levels during stress.  It appears that release of [[catecholamines]] by the [[sympathetic nervous system]] has conflicting influences on insulin release by beta cells, because insulin release is inhibited by α<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptors<ref name="pmid6252481">{{cite journal | vauthors = Nakaki T, Nakadate T, Kato R | title = Alpha 2-adrenoceptors modulating insulin release from isolated pancreatic islets | journal = Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Archives of Pharmacology | volume = 313 | issue = 2 | pages = 151–53 | date = August 1980 | pmid = 6252481 | doi = 10.1007/BF00498572 | s2cid = 30091529 }}</ref> and stimulated by β<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptors.<ref name="Layden_2010">{{cite journal | vauthors = Layden BT, Durai V, ((Lowe WL Jr)) | title = G-Protein-Coupled Receptors, Pancreatic Islets, and Diabetes | journal = Nature Education | volume = 3 | issue = 9 | page = 13 | year = 2010 | url = http://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/g-protein-coupled-receptors-pancreatic-islets-and-14257267  }}</ref> The net effect of [[norepinephrine]] from sympathetic nerves and [[epinephrine]] from adrenal glands on insulin release is inhibition due to dominance of the α-adrenergic receptors.<ref name="sabyasachi">{{cite book  | vauthors = Sircar S | title = Medical Physiology | publisher = Thieme Publishing Group | location = Stuttgart | year = 2007 | pages = 537–38 | isbn = 978-3-13-144061-7  }}</ref>

When the glucose level comes down to the usual physiologic value, insulin release from the β-cells slows or stops. If the blood glucose level drops lower than this, especially to dangerously low levels, release of hyperglycemic hormones (most prominently [[glucagon]] from islet of Langerhans alpha cells) forces release of glucose into the blood from the liver glycogen stores, supplemented by [[gluconeogenesis]] if the glycogen stores become depleted. By increasing blood glucose, the hyperglycemic hormones prevent or correct life-threatening hypoglycemia.

Evidence of impaired first-phase insulin release can be seen in the [[glucose tolerance test]], demonstrated by a substantially elevated blood glucose level at 30 minutes after the ingestion of a glucose load (75 or 100 g of glucose), followed by a slow drop over the next 100 minutes, to remain above 120&nbsp;mg/100 ml after two hours after the start of the test. In a normal person the blood glucose level is corrected (and may even be slightly over-corrected) by the end of the test. An insulin spike is a 'first response' to blood glucose increase, this response is individual and dose specific although it was always previously assumed to be food type specific only.

=== Signal transduction ===
The effects of insulin are initiated by its binding to a receptor, [[Insulin receptor|the insulin receptor (IR)]], present in the cell membrane. The receptor molecule contains an α- and β subunits. Two molecules are joined to form what is known as a homodimer. Insulin binds to the α-subunits of the homodimer, which faces the extracellular side of the cells. The β subunits have tyrosine kinase enzyme activity which is triggered by the insulin binding. This activity provokes the autophosphorylation of the β subunits and subsequently the phosphorylation of proteins inside the cell known as insulin receptor substrates (IRS). The phosphorylation of the IRS activates a signal transduction cascade that leads to the activation of other kinases as well as transcription factors that mediate the intracellular effects of insulin.<ref name="diabetesincontrol.com">{{cite news|url=http://www.diabetesincontrol.com/handbook-of-diabetes-4th-edition-excerpt-4-normal-physiology-of-insulin-secretion-and-action/|title=Handbook of Diabetes, 4th Edition, Excerpt #4: Normal Physiology of Insulin Secretion and Action|date=2014-07-28|work=Diabetes In Control.

The cascade that leads to the insertion of GLUT4 glucose transporters into the cell membranes of muscle and fat cells, and to the synthesis of glycogen in liver and muscle tissue, as well as the conversion of glucose into triglycerides in liver, adipose, and lactating mammary gland tissue, operates via the activation, by IRS-1, of phosphoinositol 3 kinase ([[phosphoinositide 3-kinase|PI3K]]). This enzyme converts a [[phospholipid]] in the cell membrane by the name of  [[phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate]] (PIP2), into [[Phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate|phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate]] (PIP3), which, in turn, activates [[AKT|protein kinase B]] (PKB).

Insulin binds to its receptor (1), which starts many protein activation cascades (2). These include translocation of Glut-4 transporter to the [[plasma membrane]] and influx of glucose (3), [[glycogen]] synthesis (4), [[glycolysis]] (5) and triglyceride synthesis (6).]]

[[File:Signal Transduction Diagram- Insulin.svg|thumb|400px|The insulin signal transduction pathway begins when insulin binds to the insulin receptor proteins. Once the transduction pathway is completed, the GLUT-4 storage vesicles becomes one with the cellular membrane. As a result, the GLUT-4 protein channels become embedded into the membrane, allowing glucose to be transported into the cell.]]

The actions of insulin on the global human metabolism level include:
* Increase of cellular intake of certain substances, most prominently glucose in muscle and [[adipose tissue]] (about two-thirds of body cells)<ref name="pmid21864752">{{cite journal | vauthors = Dimitriadis G, Mitrou P, Lambadiari V, Maratou E, Raptis SA | title = Insulin effects in muscle and adipose tissue | journal = Diabetes Research and Clinical Practice | volume = 93 Suppl 1 | pages = S52–59 | date = August 2011 | pmid = 21864752 | doi = 10.1016/S0168-8227(11)70014-6 }}</ref>
* Increase of [[DNA replication]] and [[protein synthesis]] via control of amino acid uptake
* Modification of the activity of numerous [[enzymes]].

The actions of insulin (indirect and direct) on cells include:
* Stimulates the uptake of glucose –  Insulin decreases blood glucose concentration by inducing [[cellular glucose intake|intake of glucose]] by the cells. This is possible because Insulin causes the insertion of the GLUT4 transporter in the cell membranes of muscle and fat tissues which allows glucose to enter the cell.<ref name="diabetesincontrol.com"/>
* Increased [[Fatty acid metabolism#Glycolytic endy products are used in the conversion of carbohydrates into fatty acids|fat synthesis]] – insulin forces fat cells to take in blood glucose, which is converted into [[triglyceride]]s; decrease of insulin causes the reverse.<ref name="pmid21864752" />
* Increased [[esterification]] of fatty acids – forces adipose tissue to make neutral fats (i.e., [[triglycerides]]) from fatty acids; decrease of insulin causes the reverse.<ref name="pmid21864752" />
* Decreased [[lipolysis]] – forces reduction in conversion of fat cell lipid stores into blood fatty acids and glycerol; decrease  of insulin causes the reverse.<ref name="pmid21864752" />
* Induce glycogen synthesis – When glucose levels are high, insulin induces the formation of glycogen by the activation of the hexokinase enzyme, which adds a phosphate group in glucose, thus resulting in a molecule that cannot exit the cell. At the same time, insulin inhibits the enzyme glucose-6-phosphatase, which removes the phosphate group. These two enzymes are key for the formation of glycogen. Also, insulin activates the enzymes phosphofructokinase and glycogen synthase which are responsible for glycogen synthesis.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vivo.colostate.edu/hbooks/pathphys/endocrine/pancreas/insulin_phys.html|title=Physiologic Effects of Insulin|website=www.vivo.colostate.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-06-01}}</ref>
* Decreased [[gluconeogenesis]] and [[glycogenolysis]] – decreases production of glucose from noncarbohydrate substrates, primarily in the liver (the vast majority of endogenous insulin arriving at the liver never leaves the liver); decrease of insulin causes glucose production by the liver from assorted substrates.<ref name="pmid21864752" />

=== Degradation ===
Once an insulin molecule has docked onto the receptor and effected its action, it may be released back into the extracellular environment, or it may be degraded by the cell. The two primary sites for insulin clearance are the liver and the kidney. The liver clears most insulin during first-pass transit, whereas the kidney clears most of the insulin in systemic circulation. Degradation normally involves [[endocytosis]] of the insulin-receptor complex, followed by the action of [[insulin-degrading enzyme]]. An insulin molecule produced endogenously by the beta cells is estimated to be degraded within about one hour after its initial release into circulation (insulin [[biological half-life|half-life]] ~ 4–6&nbsp;minutes).<ref name="pmid">{{cite journal | vauthors = Duckworth WC, Bennett RG, Hamel FG | title = Insulin degradation: progress and potential | journal = Endocrine Reviews | volume = 19 | issue = 5 | pages = 608–24 | date = October 1998 | pmid = 9793760 | doi = 10.1210/edrv.19.5.0349 | doi-access = free }}</ref><ref name="urlCarbohydrate and insulin metabolism in chronic kidney disease">{{cite web | url = http://www.uptodate.com/contents/carbohydrate-and-insulin-metabolism-in-chronic-kidney-disease | title = Carbohydrate and insulin metabolism in chronic kidney disease |vauthors=Palmer BF, Henrich WL | work = UpToDate, Inc }}</ref>

=== Regulator of endocannabinoid metabolism ===
Insulin is a major regulator of [[Endocannabinoids|endocannabinoid]] (EC) [[metabolism]] and insulin treatment has been shown to reduce [[intracellular]] ECs, the [[2-Arachidonoylglycerol|2-arachidonylglycerol]] (2-AG) and [[anandamide]] (AEA), which correspond with insulin-sensitive expression changes in enzymes of EC metabolism. In insulin-resistant [[adipocyte]]s, patterns of insulin-induced enzyme expression is disturbed in a manner consistent with elevated EC [[Biosynthesis|synthesis]] and reduced EC degradation. Findings suggest that [[Insulin resistance|insulin-resistant]] adipocytes fail to regulate EC metabolism and decrease intracellular EC levels in response to insulin stimulation, whereby [[Obesity|obese]] insulin-resistant individuals exhibit increased concentrations of ECs.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = D'Eon TM, Pierce KA, Roix JJ, Tyler A, Chen H, Teixeira SR | title = The role of adipocyte insulin resistance in the pathogenesis of obesity-related elevations in endocannabinoids |language=en | journal = Diabetes | volume = 57 | issue = 5 | pages = 1262–68 | date = May 2008 | pmid = 18276766 | doi = 10.2337/db07-1186 | doi-access = free }}</ref><ref name="pmid26374449">{{cite journal | vauthors = Gatta-Cherifi B, Cota D | title = New insights on the role of the endocannabinoid system in the regulation of energy balance | journal = International Journal of Obesity | volume = 40 | issue = 2 | pages = 210–19 | date = February 2016 | pmid = 26374449 | doi = 10.1038/ijo.2015.179 | s2cid = 20740277 }}</ref> This dysregulation contributes to excessive [[Adipose tissue|visceral fat]] accumulation and reduced [[adiponectin]] release from abdominal adipose tissue, and further to the onset of several cardiometabolic risk factors that are associated with obesity and [[Diabetes mellitus type 2|type 2 diabetes]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Di Marzo V | title = The endocannabinoid system in obesity and type 2 diabetes | journal = Diabetologia | volume = 51 | issue = 8 | pages = 1356–67 | date = August 2008 | pmid = 18563385 | doi = 10.1007/s00125-008-1048-2 | doi-access = free }}</ref>

[[Hypoglycemia]], also known as "low blood sugar", is when [[blood sugar]] decreases to below normal levels.<ref name=NIH2008/> This may result in a variety of [[symptoms]] including clumsiness, trouble talking, confusion, [[loss of consciousness]], [[seizures]] or death.<ref name=NIH2008/> A feeling of hunger, sweating, shakiness and weakness may also be present.<ref name=NIH2008/> Symptoms typically come on quickly.<ref name=NIH2008>{{cite web|title=Hypoglycemia|url=http://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/health-topics/Diabetes/hypoglycemia/Pages/index.aspx|website=National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases|access-date=28 June 2015|date=October 2008|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150701034430/http://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/health-topics/Diabetes/hypoglycemia/Pages/index.aspx|archive-date=1 July 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

== Diseases and syndromes ==
There are several conditions in which insulin disturbance is pathologic:
* [[Diabetes mellitus]] – general term referring to all states characterized by hyperglycemia. It can be of the following types:<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Macdonald IA | title = A review of recent evidence relating to sugars, insulin resistance and diabetes | journal = European Journal of Nutrition | volume = 55 | issue = Suppl 2 | pages = 17–23 | date = November 2016 | pmid = 27882410 | pmc = 5174139 | doi = 10.1007/s00394-016-1340-8 }}</ref>
**[[Diabetes mellitus type 1|Type 1]] – autoimmune-mediated destruction of insulin-producing β-cells in the pancreas, resulting in absolute insulin deficiency
** [[Diabetes mellitus type 2|Type 2]] – either inadequate insulin production by the β-cells or [[insulin resistance]] or both because of reasons not completely understood.
*** there is correlation with [[Diet (nutrition)|diet]], with sedentary lifestyle, with [[obesity]], with age and with [[metabolic syndrome]]. Causality has been demonstrated in multiple model organisms including mice and monkeys; importantly, non-obese people do get Type 2 diabetes due to diet, sedentary lifestyle and unknown risk factors.
*** it is likely that there is genetic susceptibility to develop Type 2 diabetes under certain environmental conditions
** Other types of impaired glucose tolerance (see the [[Diabetes]])
* [[Insulinoma]] – a tumor of beta cells producing excess insulin or [[reactive hypoglycemia]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Guettier JM, Gorden P | title = Insulin secretion and insulin-producing tumors | journal = Expert Review of Endocrinology & Metabolism | volume = 5 | issue = 2 | pages = 217–227 | date = March 2010 | pmid = 20401170 | pmc = 2853964 | doi = 10.1586/eem.09.83 }}</ref>
* [[Metabolic syndrome]] – a poorly understood condition first called syndrome X by [[Gerald Reaven]]. It is not clear whether the syndrome has a single, treatable cause, or is the result of body changes leading to type 2 diabetes. It is characterized by elevated blood pressure, dyslipidemia (disturbances in blood cholesterol forms and other blood lipids), and increased waist circumference (at least in populations in much of the developed world). The basic underlying cause may be the insulin resistance that precedes type 2 diabetes, which is a diminished capacity for [[#Physiological effects|insulin response]] in some tissues (e.g., muscle, fat). It is common for morbidities such as essential [[hypertension]], [[obesity]], type 2 diabetes, and [[cardiovascular disease]] (CVD) to develop.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Saklayen MG | title = The Global Epidemic of the Metabolic Syndrome | journal = Current Hypertension Reports | volume = 20 | issue = 2 | pages = 12 | date = February 2018 | pmid = 29480368 | pmc = 5866840 | doi = 10.1007/s11906-018-0812-z }}</ref>
* [[Polycystic ovary syndrome]] – a complex syndrome in women in the reproductive years where [[anovulation]] and [[androgen]] excess are commonly displayed as [[hirsutism]]. In many cases of PCOS, insulin resistance is present.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = El Hayek S, Bitar L, Hamdar LH, Mirza FG, Daoud G | title = Poly Cystic Ovarian Syndrome: An Updated Overview | journal = Frontiers in Physiology | volume = 7 | pages = 124 | date = 2016-04-05 | pmid = 27092084 | pmc = 4820451 | doi = 10.3389/fphys.2016.00124 }}</ref>

Several analogs of human insulin are available. These [[insulin analog]]s are closely related to the human insulin structure, and were developed for specific aspects of glycemic control in terms of fast action (prandial insulins) and long action (basal insulins).<ref>[[Insulin analog]]</ref> The first biosynthetic insulin analog was developed for clinical use at mealtime (prandial insulin), [[Humalog]] (insulin lispro),<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Vecchio|first1=Ignazio|last2=Tornali|first2=Cristina|last3=Bragazzi|first3=Nicola Luigi|last4=Martini|first4=Mariano|date=2018-10-23|title=The Discovery of Insulin: An Important Milestone in the History of Medicine|journal=Frontiers in Endocrinology|volume=9|pages=613|doi=10.3389/fendo.2018.00613|pmc=6205949|pmid=30405529}}</ref> it is more rapidly absorbed after subcutaneous injection than regular insulin, with an effect 15&nbsp;minutes after injection.

Fast acting insulins do not require the injection-to-meal interval previously recommended for human insulin and animal insulins. The other type is long acting insulin; the first of these was [[Lantus]] (insulin glargine). These have a steady effect for an extended period from 18 to 24&nbsp;hours. Likewise, another protracted insulin analogue ([[Levemir]]) is based on a fatty acid acylation approach. A [[myristic acid]] molecule is attached to this analogue, which associates the insulin molecule to the abundant serum albumin, which in turn extends the effect and reduces the risk of hypoglycemia. Both protracted analogues need to be taken only once daily, and are used for type 1 diabetics as the basal insulin. A combination of a rapid acting and a protracted insulin is also available, making it more likely for patients to achieve an insulin profile that mimics that of the body's own insulin release.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Ulrich|first1=Heather|last2=Snyder|first2=Benjamin|last3=K Garg|first3=Satish|date=2007|title=Combining insulins for optimal blood glucose control in type 1 and 2 diabetes: Focus on insulin glulisine|journal=Vascular Health and Risk Management|volume=3|issue=3|pages=245–254|pmc=2293970|pmid=17703632}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Silver|first1=Bahendeka|last2=Ramaiya|first2=Kaushik|last3=Andrew|first3=Swai Babu|last4=Fredrick|first4=Otieno|last5=Bajaj|first5=Sarita|last6=Kalra|first6=Sanjay|last7=Charlotte|first7=Bavuma M.|last8=Claudine|first8=Karigire|last9=Makhoba|first9=Anthony|date=2018|title=EADSG Guidelines: Insulin Therapy in Diabetes|journal=Diabetes Therapy|language=en|volume=9|issue=2|pages=449–492|doi=10.1007/s13300-018-0384-6|pmc=6104264|pmid=29508275}}</ref>

Insulin is usually taken as [[subcutaneous injection]]s by single-use [[syringe]]s with [[hypodermic needle|needles]], via an [[insulin pump]], or by repeated-use [[insulin pen]]s with disposable needles. [[Inhaled insulin]] is also available in the U.S. market now.

Synthetic insulin can trigger adverse effects, so some people with diabetes rely on animal-source insulin.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.iddt.org/diabetic-commonsense/the-great-debate-natural-animal-or-artificial-human-insulin|title=The Great Debate: Natural Animal or Artificial 'Human' Insulin?}}</ref>

Unlike many medicines, insulin cannot be taken [[Oral administration|by mouth]] because, like nearly all other proteins introduced into the [[Human gastrointestinal tract|gastrointestinal tract]], it is reduced to fragments, whereupon all activity is lost. There has been some research into ways to protect insulin from the digestive tract, so that it can be administered orally or sublingually.<ref name="pmid27364922">{{cite journal | vauthors = Wong CY, Martinez J, Dass CR | title = Oral delivery of insulin for treatment of diabetes: status quo, challenges and opportunities | journal = The Journal of Pharmacy and Pharmacology | volume = 68 | issue = 9 | pages = 1093–108 | year = 2016 | pmid = 27364922 | doi = 10.1111/jphp.12607 | doi-access = free }}</ref><ref name="pmid27014614">{{cite journal | vauthors = Shah RB, Patel M, Maahs DM, Shah VN | title = Insulin delivery methods: Past, present and future | journal = International Journal of Pharmaceutical Investigation | volume = 6 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–9 | year = 2016 | pmid = 27014614 | pmc = 4787057 | doi = 10.4103/2230-973X.176456 }}</ref>

== History of study ==

=== Discovery ===
In 1869, while studying the structure of the [[pancreas]] under a [[microscope]], [[Paul Langerhans]], a medical student in [[Berlin]], identified some previously unnoticed tissue clumps scattered throughout the bulk of the pancreas.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Sakula|first=A|title=Paul Langerhans (1847–1888): a centenary tribute|journal=Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine|date=July 1988|volume=81|pmc=1291675|pmid=3045317|issue=7|pages=414–15|doi=10.1177/014107688808100718}}</ref> The function of the "little heaps of cells", later [[eponym|known as]] the ''[[islets of Langerhans]]'', initially remained unknown, but [[Édouard Laguesse]] later suggested they might produce secretions that play a regulatory role in digestion.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://musee.chru-lille.fr/Memoire/Medecins/48029.html |title=Edouard Laguesse (1861–1927) |last=Petit |first=Henri |language=fr |website=Museum of the Regional Hospital of Lille |access-date=2018-07-25 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> Paul Langerhans' son, Archibald, also helped to understand this regulatory role.

In 1889, the physician [[Oskar Minkowski]], in collaboration with [[Joseph von Mering]], removed the pancreas from a healthy dog to test its assumed role in digestion. On testing the urine, they found sugar, establishing for the first time a relationship between the pancreas and diabetes. In 1901, another major step was taken by the American physician and scientist [[Eugene Lindsay Opie]], when he isolated the role of the pancreas to the islets of Langerhans: "Diabetes mellitus when the result of a lesion of the pancreas is caused by destruction of the islands of Langerhans and occurs only when these bodies are in part or wholly destroyed".<ref name="Johns Hopkins Hosp.

Over the next two decades researchers made several attempts to isolate the islets' secretions. In 1906 [[George Ludwig Zuelzer]] achieved partial success in treating dogs with pancreatic extract, but he was unable to continue his work. Between 1911 and 1912, [[Ernest Lyman Scott|E.L. Scott]] at the [[University of Chicago]] tried aqueous pancreatic extracts and noted "a slight diminution of glycosuria", but was unable to convince his director of his work's value; it was shut down. [[Israel Kleiner (biochemist)|Israel Kleiner]] demonstrated similar effects at [[Rockefeller University]] in 1915, but [[World War I]] interrupted his work and he did not return to it.<ref name="J.

In 1916, [[Nicolae Paulescu]] developed an [[aqueous]] [[Pancreas|pancreatic]] extract which, when injected into a [[Diabetes|diabetic]] dog, had a normalizing effect on [[blood sugar|blood-sugar]] levels. He had to interrupt his experiments because of [[World War I]], and in 1921 he wrote four papers about his work carried out in [[Bucharest]] and his tests on a diabetic dog.

The name "insulin" was coined by [[Edward Albert Sharpey-Schafer]] in 1916 for a hypothetical molecule produced by pancreatic islets of Langerhans (Latin ''insula'' for islet or island) that controls glucose metabolism. Unbeknown to Sharpey-Schafer, Jean de Meyer had introduced very similar word "insuline" in 1909 for the same molecule.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=de Leiva|first1=Alberto|last2=Brugués|first2=Eulàlia|last3=de Leiva-Pérez|first3=Alejandra | name-list-style = vanc |date=2011|title=The discovery of insulin: Continued controversies after ninety years|journal=Endocrinología y Nutrición (English Edition)|language=en|volume=58|issue=9|pages=449–456|doi=10.1016/j.endoen.2011.10.001}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Vecchio|first1=Ignazio|last2=Tornali|first2=Cristina|last3=Bragazzi|first3=Nicola Luigi|last4=Martini|first4=Mariano | name-list-style = vanc |date=2018-10-23|title=The Discovery of Insulin: An Important Milestone in the History of Medicine|journal=Frontiers in Endocrinology|volume=9|pages=613|doi=10.3389/fendo.2018.00613|pmc=6205949|pmid=30405529}}</ref>

=== Extraction and purification ===

In October 1920, Canadian [[Frederick Banting]] concluded that the digestive secretions that Minkowski had originally studied were breaking down the islet secretion, thereby making it impossible to extract successfully. A surgeon by training, Banting knew that blockages of the pancreatic duct would lead most of the pancreas to atrophy, while leaving the islets of Langerhans intact. He reasoned that a relatively pure extract could be made from the islets once most of the rest of the pancreas was gone. He jotted a note to himself: "Ligate pancreatic ducts of the dog. Keep dogs alive till acini degenerate leaving islets. Try to isolate internal secretion of these and relieve glycosuria."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://insulin.library.utoronto.ca/islandora/object/insulin%3AN10002|title=Note dated Oct 31/20 from loose leaf notebook 1920/21|last=Banting|first=Frederick G.|date=31 October 1920|website=University of Toronto Libraries}}</ref><ref name="rosenfeld2002">{{cite journal | vauthors = Rosenfeld L | title = Insulin: discovery and controversy | journal = Clinical Chemistry | volume = 48 | issue = 12 | pages = 2270–88 | date = December 2002 | pmid = 12446492 | doi = 10.1093/clinchem/48.12.2270 | doi-access = free }}</ref>

In the spring of 1921, Banting traveled to [[Toronto]] to explain his idea to [[John James Rickard Macleod|J.J.R. Macleod]], Professor of Physiology at the [[University of Toronto]]. Macleod was initially skeptical, since Banting had no background in research and was not familiar with the latest literature, but he agreed to provide lab space for Banting to test out his ideas. Macleod also arranged for two undergraduates to be Banting's lab assistants that summer, but Banting required only one lab assistant. [[Charles Herbert Best|Charles Best]] and Clark Noble flipped a coin; Best won the coin toss and took the first shift. This proved unfortunate for Noble, as Banting kept Best for the entire summer and eventually shared half his Nobel Prize money and credit for the discovery with Best.<ref name="pmid12473641">{{cite journal | vauthors = Wright JR | title = Almost famous: E.

Banting and Best presented their results to Macleod on his return to Toronto in the fall of 1921, but Macleod pointed out flaws with the experimental design, and suggested the experiments be repeated with more dogs and better equipment. He moved Banting and Best into a better laboratory and began paying Banting a salary from his research grants. Several weeks later, the second round of experiments was also a success, and Macleod helped publish their results privately in Toronto that November. Bottlenecked by the time-consuming task of duct-tying dogs and waiting several weeks to extract insulin, Banting hit upon the idea of extracting insulin from the fetal calf pancreas, which had not yet developed digestive glands. By December, they had also succeeded in extracting insulin from the adult cow pancreas. Macleod discontinued all other research in his laboratory to concentrate on the purification of insulin. He invited biochemist [[James Collip]] to help with this task, and the team felt ready for a clinical test within a month.<ref name="rosenfeld2002"/>

Banting and Best never worked well with Collip, regarding him as something of an interloper, and Collip left the project soon after. Over the spring of 1922, Best managed to improve his techniques to the point where large quantities of insulin could be extracted on demand, but the preparation remained impure. The drug firm [[Eli Lilly and Company]] had offered assistance not long after the first publications in 1921, and they took Lilly up on the offer in April. In November, Lilly's head chemist, [[George B. Walden]] discovered [[Protein precipitation#Isoelectric precipitation|isoelectric precipitation]] and was able to produce large quantities of highly refined insulin. Shortly thereafter, insulin was offered for sale to the general public.

=== Patent ===
Toward the end of January 1922, tensions mounted between the four "co-discoverers" of insulin and Collip briefly threatened to separately [[patent]] his purification process. [[John G. FitzGerald]], director of the non-commercial public health institution [[Connaught Laboratories]], therefore stepped in as peacemaker. The resulting agreement of 25 January 1922 established two key conditions: 1) that the collaborators would sign a contract agreeing not to take out a patent with a commercial pharmaceutical firm during an initial working period with Connaught; and 2) that no changes in research policy would be allowed unless first discussed among FitzGerald and the four collaborators.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://insulin.library.utoronto.ca/islandora/object/insulin%3AW10033|title=Memorandum in reference to the co-operation of the Connaught Antitoxin Laboratories in the researches conducted by Dr. Banting, Mr. Best and Dr. Collip under the general direction of Professor J.J.R. Macleod to obtain an extract of pancreas having a specific effect on blood sugar concentration|last=University of Toronto Board of Governors Insulin Committee|date=25 Jan 1922|website=University of Toronto Libraries}}</ref> It helped contain disagreement and tied the research to Connaught's public mandate.

Initially, Macleod and Banting were particularly reluctant to patent their process for insulin on grounds of medical ethics. However, concerns remained that a private third-party would hijack and monopolize the research (as [[Eli Lilly and Company]] had hinted<ref>{{cite book |last=Bliss | first = Michael | name-list-style = vanc |title=The discovery of insulin |date=2007|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=9780226058993|edition= 25th anniversary |location=Chicago|pages=132|oclc=74987867|quote=The Lilly company would be delighted to work with Toronto, [[George Henry Alexander Clowes|Clowes]] wrote, and hinted, perhaps intentionally, perhaps not, that Toronto could be bypassed: "I have thus far refrained from starting work in our laboratories on the field of this question as I was anxious to avoid in any way intruding on the field of yourself and your associates until you had published your results. I feel, however, that the matter is now one of such immediate importance that we should take up the experimental end of the question without delay, preferably cooperating with you and your associates..."}}</ref>), and that safe distribution would be difficult to guarantee without capacity for quality control. To this end, [[Edward Calvin Kendall]] gave valuable advice. He had isolated [[thyroxin]] at the [[Mayo Clinic]] in 1914 and patented the process through an arrangement between himself, the brothers Mayo, and the [[University of Minnesota]], transferring the patent to the public university.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://insulin.library.utoronto.ca/islandora/object/insulin%3AL10262|title=Letter to Dr. J.

The first genetically engineered, synthetic "human" insulin was produced using [[Escherichia coli|''E. coli'']] in 1978 by [[Arthur Riggs (geneticist)|Arthur Riggs]] and [[Keiichi Itakura]] at the [[Beckman Research Institute]] of the [[City of Hope National Medical Center|City of Hope]] in collaboration with [[Herbert Boyer]] at [[Genentech]].<ref name="urlGenentech" /><ref name="urlRecombinant DNA technology in the synthesis of human insulin" /> Genentech, founded by Swanson, Boyer and [[Eli Lilly and Company]], went on in 1982 to sell the first commercially available biosynthetic human insulin under the brand name [[Humulin]].<ref name="urlRecombinant DNA technology in the synthesis of human insulin"/> The vast majority of insulin used worldwide is biosynthetic recombinant "human" insulin or its analogues.<ref name="pmid23222785" /> Recently, another approach has been used by a pioneering group of Canadian researchers, using an easily grown [[safflower]] plant, for the production of much cheaper insulin.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ctvnews.ca/new-source-of-insulin-blossoming-on-the-prairies-1.479043|title=Safflowers may provide new insulin source {{!}} CTV News|website=www.ctvnews.ca|access-date=2019-11-12|date=February 2010}}</ref>

Recombinant insulin is produced either in yeast (usually ''[[baker's yeast|Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'') or ''E. coli''.<ref name="pmid11030562">{{cite journal | vauthors = Kjeldsen T | title = Yeast secretory expression of insulin precursors | journal = Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology | volume = 54 | issue = 3 | pages = 277–86 | date = September 2000 | pmid = 11030562 | doi = 10.1007/s002530000402 | s2cid = 9246671 | url = http://w3.ualg.pt/~jvarela/biotecnol/pdf/humaninsulin.pdf | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170927000623/http://w3.ualg.pt/~jvarela/biotecnol/pdf/humaninsulin.pdf | archive-date = 2017-09-27 }}</ref> In yeast, insulin may be engineered as a single-chain protein with a KexII endoprotease (a yeast homolog of PCI/PCII) site that separates the insulin A chain from a C-terminally truncated insulin B chain.  A chemically synthesized C-terminal tail is then grafted onto insulin by reverse proteolysis using the inexpensive protease trypsin; typically the lysine on the C-terminal tail is protected with a chemical protecting group to prevent proteolysis.  The ease of modular synthesis and the relative safety of modifications in that region accounts for common insulin analogs with C-terminal modifications (e.g. lispro, aspart, glulisine).  The Genentech synthesis and completely chemical synthesis such as that by [[Bruce Merrifield]] are not preferred because the efficiency of recombining the two insulin chains is low, primarily due to competition with the precipitation of insulin B chain.

=== Nobel Prizes ===

[[File:C. H. Best and F. G. Banting ca. 1924.png|thumb|[[Frederick Banting]] (right) joined by [[Charles Herbert Best|Charles Best]] 1924]]

The [[Nobel Prize]] committee in 1923 credited the practical extraction of insulin to a team at the [[University of Toronto]] and awarded the Nobel Prize to two men: [[Frederick Banting]] and [[John James Rickard Macleod|J.J.R. Macleod]].<ref name="urlThe Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1923">{{cite web | url = http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1923/ | title = The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1923 | publisher = The Nobel Foundation }}</ref> They were awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] in 1923 for the discovery of insulin. Banting, incensed that Best was not mentioned,<ref>{{cite web | first = Adam | last = Felman | name-list-style = vanc | date = 22 November 2018 | title = Who discovered insulin? | work = Medical News Today | url = https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/323774.php}}</ref> shared his prize with him, and Macleod immediately shared his with [[James Collip]]. The patent for insulin was sold to the [[University of Toronto]] for one dollar.

Two other Nobel Prizes have been awarded for work on insulin. British molecular biologist [[Frederick Sanger]], who determined the [[primary structure]] of insulin in 1955, was awarded the 1958 [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]].<ref name="Stretton_2002">{{cite journal | vauthors = Stretton AO | title = The first sequence. Fred Sanger and insulin | journal = Genetics | volume = 162 | issue = 2 | pages = 527–32 | date = October 2002 | pmid = 12399368 | pmc = 1462286 }}</ref> [[Rosalyn Sussman Yalow]] received the 1977 Nobel Prize in Medicine for the development of the [[radioimmunoassay]] for insulin.

Several Nobel Prizes also have an indirect connection with insulin. [[George Minot]], co-recipient of the 1934 Nobel Prize for the development of the first effective treatment for [[pernicious anemia]], had [[diabetes mellitus]].  Dr. [[William Bosworth Castle|William Castle]] observed that the 1921 discovery of insulin, arriving in time to keep Minot alive, was therefore also responsible for the discovery of a cure for [[pernicious anemia]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Castle WB | title = The Gordon Wilson Lecture. A Century of Curiosity About Pernicious Anemia | journal = Transactions of the American Clinical and Climatological Association | volume = 73 | pages = 54–80 | year = 1962 | pmid = 21408623 | pmc = 2249021 | author-link = William Bosworth Castle }}</ref> [[Dorothy Hodgkin]] was awarded a Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1964 for the development of [[crystallography]], the technique she used for deciphering the complete molecular structure of insulin in 1969.<ref name=":2" />

==== Controversy ====
[[File:Nicolae Paulescu - Foto03.jpg|thumb|100px|[[Nicolae Paulescu]]]]

The work published by Banting, Best, Collip and Macleod represented the preparation of purified insulin extract suitable for use on human patients.<ref name="pmid20314060">{{cite journal | vauthors = Banting FG, Best CH, Collip JB, Campbell WR, Fletcher AA | title = Pancreatic Extracts in the Treatment of Diabetes Mellitus | journal = Canadian Medical Association Journal | volume = 12 | issue = 3 | pages = 141–46 | date = March 1922 | pmid = 20314060 | pmc = 1524425 }}</ref> Although Paulescu discovered the principles of the treatment, his saline extract could not be used on humans; he was not mentioned in the 1923 Nobel Prize. Professor Ian Murray was particularly active in working to correct "the historical wrong" against [[Nicolae Paulescu]]. Murray was a professor of physiology at the Anderson College of Medicine in [[Glasgow]], [[Scotland]], the head of the department of Metabolic Diseases at a leading Glasgow hospital, vice-president of the British Association of Diabetes, and a founding member of the [[International Diabetes Federation]]. Murray wrote:

<blockquote>Insufficient recognition has been given to Paulescu, the distinguished [[Romania]]n scientist, who at the time when the Toronto team were commencing their research had already succeeded in extracting the antidiabetic hormone of the pancreas and proving its efficacy in reducing the hyperglycaemia in diabetic dogs.<ref name="pmid4560502">{{cite journal | vauthors = Drury MI | title = The golden jubile of insulin | journal = Journal of the Irish Medical Association | volume = 65 | issue = 14 | pages = 355–63 | date = July 1972 | pmid = 4560502 }}</ref>
</blockquote>

In a private communication, Professor [[Arne Tiselius]], former head of the Nobel Institute, expressed his personal opinion that Paulescu was equally worthy of the award in 1923.<ref name="pmid4930788">{{cite journal | vauthors = Murray I | title = Paulesco and the isolation of insulin | journal = Journal of the History of Medicine and Allied Sciences | volume = 26 | issue = 2 | pages = 150–57 | date = April 1971 | pmid = 4930788 | doi = 10.1093/jhmas/XXVI.2.150 }}</ref>
