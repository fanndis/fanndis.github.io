A '''monetary hawk''', or hawk for short, is someone who advocates keeping [[inflation]] low as the top priority in [[monetary policy]]. In contrast, a '''monetary dove''' is someone who emphasizes other issues, especially low [[unemployment]], over low inflation.

The two terms are commonly used in the [[United States]] to describe members and nominees to the [[Federal Reserve Board of Governors]], who have major influence on [[United States monetary policy]] in their roles as Federal Reserve Governors and as members of the [[Federal Open Market Committee]].<ref name=Gura>{{cite news|last=Gura|first=David|title=The economic shorthand of hawks and doves|url=http://www.marketplace.org/topics/economy/economic-shorthand-hawks-and-doves|accessdate=13 March 2014|newspaper=Marketplace.org|date=13 November 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140313072743/http://www.marketplace.org/topics/economy/economic-shorthand-hawks-and-doves|archive-date=13 March 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=BI>{{cite news|last=Kawa|first=Lucas|title=HAWKS & DOVES: Meet The 12 People Who Will Control America's Monetary Policy In 2013|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/the-2013-fomc-member-profiles-2013-1?op=1|accessdate=13 March 2014|newspaper=Business Insider|date=10 January 2013}}</ref> The terms are also used outside of the [[United States]], in places such as the [[United Kingdom]]<ref name=BBC>{{cite news|title=Bank of England MPC: Who sets UK interest rates?|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-12997437|accessdate=13 March 2014|newspaper=BBC|date=23 November 2011}}</ref> and [[India]].<ref name=ET>{{cite news|last=ET Bureau|title=RBI a vigilant owl, neither a dove, nor a hawk: Raghuram Rajan on monetary policy|url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2014-01-29/news/46782674_1_core-inflation-inflation-targeting-policy-rates|accessdate=13 March 2014|newspaper=The Economic Times|date=29 January 2014}}</ref> The term "pigeon" has been used to describe individuals who take positions between those of hawks and doves,<ref name=Gura/> although the term "centrist" is also used.

Doves generally are more in favor of expansionary [[monetary policy]], including low [[interest rates]], while hawks tend to favor "tight" monetary policy. For example, doves in the United States tend to favor [[quantitative easing]], seeing it as a way to stimulate the economy,<ref name=Yellen>{{cite news|last=GI|title=A new hand on the tiller| url = https://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2013/10/federal-reserve|accessdate=12 March 2014|newspaper=Economist|date=9 October 2013}}</ref> while hawks tend to oppose quantitative easing, seeing it as a distortion of asset markets.<ref name=Gura/> Additionally, hawks tend to project higher future inflation, and hence see more risk from inflation and a greater need for tight monetary policies, while doves tend to predict lower future inflation, and hence see more need for expansionary monetary policies.<ref name=EconoMonitor>{{cite news|last=Duy|first=Tim|title=On Labels, Dove vs. Hawk|url=http://www.economonitor.com/blog/2012/04/on-labels-dove-vs-hawk/|accessdate=13 March 2014|newspaper=EconoMonitor|date=17 April 2012}}</ref>

An individual can be a hawk in some cases and a dove in others.<ref name=EconoMonitor/> For example, [[Janet Yellen]] was described as a hawk during the economic boom of the 1990s, but was usually described as a dove when she was nominated to the position of [[Chair of the Federal Reserve]].<ref name=Atlantic>{{cite news|last=O'Brien|first=Matthew|title=Fed Favorite Janet Yellen Is No Dove—and That's a Good Thing|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2013/09/fed-favorite-janet-yellen-is-no-dove-and-thats-a-good-thing/279775/|accessdate=13 March 2014|newspaper=The Atlantic|date=17 September 2013}}</ref> Additionally, the label of "hawk" and "dove" may be applied differently depending on the point of view.<ref name=RA>{{cite news|last=RA|title=Of doves and dovishness|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2013/10/monetary-policy-1|accessdate=13 March 2014|newspaper=The Economist|date=14 October 2013}}</ref>

The hawk–dove dichotomy has been criticized as overly simplistic, especially in times of [[deflation]] or low inflation. For example, [[Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis]] President [[James B. Bullard|James Bullard]] has been described as a "deflation hawk" for favoring policies that would raise inflation to a target of 2 percent per year. ''[[Washington Post]]'' columnist Neil Irwin used the term "bubble hawk" to describe those who focus on using monetary policy to fight [[Economic bubble|financial bubbles]].<ref name=Irwin>{{cite news|last=Irwin|first=Neil|title=Why we shouldn’t think of central bankers as hawks and doves|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/07/30/why-we-shouldnt-think-of-central-bankers-as-hawks-and-doves/|accessdate=13 March 2014|newspaper=Washington Post|date=30 July 2013}}</ref>
