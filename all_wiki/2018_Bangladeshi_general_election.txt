==Background==
The [[2014 Bangladeshi general election|previous general elections]] in January 2014 were [[election boycott|boycotted]] by the main opposition alliance, led by the [[Bangladesh Nationalist Party]] (BNP) and three-time former Prime Minister [[Khaleda Zia]]. As a result, the [[Awami League]] led by Prime Minister [[Sheikh Hasina]] won a landslide victory, taking 234 of the 300 seats in an election that saw 153 seats uncontested.<ref name=bdnews1>[http://bdnews24.com/bangladesh/2014/01/06/re-election-in-8-constituencies Repolls ordered in 8 constituencies] BD News 24,  14 September 2013</ref>

In July 2017, the BNP stated that it was ready to contest the next general elections if parliament was dissolved and the election commission consisted of non-partisan members.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/politics/2017/07/25/fakhrul-election-level-playing-field/|title=Fakhrul: General elections will not be allowed without a level playing field|date=25 July 2017}}</ref> On 14 September 2017 the Official Chief Election Commissioner confirmed that the BNP would contest the elections.<ref>[https://en.prothomalo.com/bangladesh/news/159399/BNP-will-join-national-polls-CEC BNP will join national polls: CEC] Prothom Alo, 14 September 2017</ref> However, following the conviction of BNP chair [[Khaleda Zia]] for corruption,<ref>[https://www.thedailystar.net/politics/news/zia-charitable-trust-case-supreme-court-bangladesh-directs-dhaka-court-deliver-verdict-bnp-chairperson-khaleda-zia-1653295 Zia Charitable Trust Graft Case: Khaleda jailed for 7 years] The Daily Star, 30 October 2018</ref> the [[High Court of Bangladesh]] ruled that Zia was ineligible to run for office.<ref>[https://www.thedailystar.net/politics/khaleda-zia-cannot-contest-bangladesh-national-election-2018-1665847 HC ruling apparently a blow to Khaleda] The Daily Star, 28 November 2018</ref> As such her role is unclear in any potential government which contained the BNP.

==Campaign==
In August 2017, [[Jatiya Party (Ershad)]] chairman and former [[President of Bangladesh|President]] Hussain Ershad indicated that he wanted his party to leave the [[Awami League]]-led [[Grand Alliance (Bangladesh)|Grand Alliance]] and join a new alliance with democratic left and Islamic democratic parties.<ref>[http://m.bdnews24.com/en/detail/politics/1374318 Ershad hopes PM will allow Jatiya Party ministers to resign] BD News 24, 4 August 2017</ref>{{failed verification|date=December 2018}} In November 2018 the party announced that it would join the Awami League-led alliance.<ref>[https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/politics/2018/11/05/jatiya-party-will-join-al-as-ally Jatiya Party to join AL-led alliance] Dhaka Tribune, 5 November 2018</ref> On 28 December, Ershad announced [[Jatiya Party (Ershad)|Jatiya Party]] candidates contesting from “open seats” would support the ruling Awami League-led grand alliance candidates and extended his support to "my [his] 'sister' Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina".<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=https://www.thedailystar.net/bangladesh-national-election-2018/news/ershad-steps-out-election-race-dhaka-17-1679506|title=I am back for sister Hasina|date=28 December 2018|work=The Daily Star|language=en|access-date=28 December 2018}}</ref> Ershad personally withdrew from contesting the [[Dhaka-17]] seat in favour of the Awami League candidate.<ref name=":1" /> Ershad said however that “strong candidates” of his party would stay in the race.<ref name=":1" />
