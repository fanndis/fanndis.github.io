'''Blues rock''' is a [[music genre|fusion genre]] combining elements of [[blues]] and [[Rock music|rock]]. It is mostly an electric ensemble-style music with instrumentation similar to electric blues and rock: electric guitar, electric bass guitar, and drums, sometimes with keyboards and harmonica. From its beginnings in the early to mid-1960s, blues rock has gone through several stylistic shifts and along the way it inspired and influenced [[hard rock]], [[Southern rock]], and early [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]]. Blues rock continues to be an influence in the 2020s, with performances and recordings by popular artists.

Blues rock started with rock musicians in the [[UK]] and the [[US]] performing American blues songs. They typically recreated electric [[Chicago blues]] songs, such as those by [[Muddy Waters]], [[Jimmy Reed]], [[Howlin' Wolf]], and [[Albert King]], at faster tempos and with a more aggressive sound common to rock. In the UK, the style was popularized by groups like [[the Rolling Stones]], [[the Yardbirds]], and [[the Animals]], who placed several blues songs into the pop charts. In the US, [[Lonnie Mack]], the [[Paul Butterfield Blues Band]], and [[Canned Heat]] were among the earliest exponents and later "attempted to play long, involved improvisations which were commonplace on jazz records".<ref name="amg">

}}</ref> [[John Mayall & the Bluesbreakers]] and [[Peter Green (musician)|Peter Green]]'s [[Fleetwood Mac]] also developed this more instrumental, but traditional-based style in the UK, while late 1960s and early 1970s groups, including [[Ten Years After]], [[Savoy Brown]], the [[Climax Blues Band]] and [[Foghat]] became more hard rock oriented. In the US, [[Johnny Winter]], [[the Allman Brothers Band]], and [[ZZ Top]] represented a hard rock trend.

Along with hard rock, blues rock songs became the core of the music played on [[album-oriented rock]] radio, and later the [[classic rock]] format birthed in the 1980s.<ref>Pareles, Jon (June 18, 1986). [https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/18/arts/oldies-on-rise-in-album-rock-radio.html "Oldies on Rise in Album-Rock Radio"]. ''[[The New York Times]]''. Retrieved April 19, 2019.</ref>

Although around this time, the differences between blues rock and hard rock lessened,<ref name="amg"/> there was also a return to more traditional blues styles in the 1980s, when [[the Fabulous Thunderbirds]] and [[Stevie Ray Vaughan]], recorded their best-known works and the 1990s saw guitarists [[Gary Moore]], [[Jeff Healey]], and [[Kenny Wayne Shepherd]] become popular concert attractions. Groups such as the [[Jon Spencer Blues Explosion]] and [[the White Stripes]], brought an edgier, more diverse style into the 2000s, while [[the Black Keys]] returned to basics.

==Characteristics==
Blues rock can be characterized by bluesy [[Improvisation#Music|improvisation]], the [[twelve-bar blues]], extended [[boogie]] [[jam session|jams]] typically focused on the electric guitar player, and often a heavier, [[riff]]-oriented sound and feel to the songs than found in typical [[Chicago blues|Chicago-style blues]]. Blues rock bands "borrow[ed] the idea of an instrumental combo and loud amplification from rock & roll".<ref name="amg" /> It is also often played at a fast tempo, again distinguishing it from the blues.<ref name="amg" />

===Instrumentation===
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2018}}
The core blues rock sound is created by the electric guitar, bass guitar and drums.  The electric guitar is usually amplified through a tube guitar amplifier or using an [[Distortion (music)|overdrive]] effect. Two guitars are commonplace in blues rock bands: one guitarist focused on [[rhythm guitar]], playing riffs and chords as accompaniment; and the other focused on [[lead guitar]], playing melodic lines and solos.

While 1950s-era blues bands sometimes used the [[double bass|upright bass]], the blues rock bands of the 1960s used the electric bass, which was easier to amplify to loud volumes.  [[Electronic keyboard|Keyboard]] instruments, such as the piano and [[Hammond organ]], are also occasionally used. As with the electric guitar, the sound of the Hammond organ is typically amplified with a tube amplifier, which gives a growling, "overdriven" sound quality to the instrument.

Vocals also typically play a key role, although the vocals may be equal in importance or even subordinate to the lead guitar playing. As well, a number of blues rock pieces are instrumental-only. Sometimes bands also included a [[Richter-tuned harmonica]] or "harp".

===Structure===
Blues rock pieces often follow typical blues structures, such as [[twelve-bar blues]], [[sixteen-bar blues]], etc. They also use the [[Tonic (music)|I]]-[[Subdominant|IV]]-[[Dominant (music)|V]] progression, though there are exceptions, some pieces having a "B" section, while others remain on the I. [[The Allman Brothers Band]]'s version of "[[Stormy Monday]]", which uses [[chord substitution]]s based on [[Bobby "Blue" Bland]]'s 1961 rendition, adds a solo section where "the rhythm shifts effortlessly into an uptempo 6/8-time jazz feel".<ref name="Poe">

One notable difference is the frequent use of a straight eighth-note or rock rhythm instead of [[Tuplet#Triplets|triplets]] usually found in blues. An example is [[Cream (band)|Cream]]'s "[[Cross Road Blues#Eric Clapton/Cream interpretation|Crossroads]]". Although it was adapted from [[Robert Johnson (musician)|Robert Johnson]]'s "[[Cross Road Blues]]", the bass "combines with drums to create and continually emphasize continuity in the regular metric drive".<ref name="Covach">{{cite book | title=Understanding Rock: Essays in Musical Analysis | url=https://archive.org/details/understandingroc00cova | url-access=limited | publisher=Oxford University Press | author=Covach, John | year=1997 | pages=[https://archive.org/details/understandingroc00cova/page/n81 63]–71 | isbn=978-0-19510-0051}}</ref> Cream also uses some of the lyrics from "[[Traveling Riverside Blues]]" to create their own interpretation of the song.

Rock and blues have historically always been closely linked, with driving rhythms and [[electric guitar]] techniques such as [[distortion (music)|distortion]] and [[power chord]]s already used by 1950s blues guitarists, particularly [[Memphis blues]]men such as [[Joe Hill Louis]], [[Willie Johnson (guitarist)|Willie Johnson]] and [[Pat Hare]].<ref name="palmer">Robert Palmer, "Church of the Sonic Guitar", pp. 13–38 in Anthony DeCurtis, ''Present Tense'', Duke University Press, 1992, pp. 24–27. {{ISBN|0-8223-1265-4}}.</ref><ref name="rolling_memphis">{{cite book|last=Miller|first=Jim|title=The Rolling Stone illustrated history of rock & roll|year=1980|publisher=[[Rolling Stone]]|location=New York|isbn=0394513223|url=https://archive.org/details/rollingstoneillu00mill|url-access=registration|access-date=5 July 2012|quote=Black country bluesmen made raw, heavily amplified boogie records of their own, especially in Memphis, where guitarists like Joe Hill Louis, Willie Johnson (with the early Howlin' Wolf band) and Pat Hare (with Little Junior Parker) played driving rhythms and scorching, distorted solos that might be counted the distant ancestors of heavy metal.}}</ref> Characteristics that blues rock adopted from [[electric blues]] include its dense texture, basic blues band instrumentation,<ref>Michael Campbell & James Brody, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=RK-JmVbv4OIC&pg=PA80 Rock and Roll: An Introduction], pages 80–81</ref> rough declamatory vocal style, heavy guitar [[riff]]s, string-bending blues-scale guitar solos, strong beat, thick riff-laden texture, and posturing performances.<ref>Michael Campbell & James Brody (2007), ''Rock and Roll: An Introduction'', [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=XTo8AAAAQBAJ&pg=PA201 page 201]</ref> Precursors to blues rock included the Chicago blues musicians [[Elmore James]], [[Albert King]], and [[Freddie King]], who began incorporating rock and roll elements into their blues music during the late 1950s to early 1960s.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1Mdf4BOnI9IC&pg=PA102|title=Blues Singers: Elmore James entry|access-date=2013-06-02|author=Dicaire, David|publisher=[[McFarland & Company|McFarland]]|year=1999|isbn=9780786406067}}</ref><ref>John Morthland (2013), [http://www.wonderingsound.com/spotlight/how-elmore-james-invented-metal/ How Elmore James Invented Metal] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304094851/http://www.wonderingsound.com/spotlight/how-elmore-james-invented-metal/ |date=2016-03-04 }}, ''Wondering Sound'', [[eMusic]]</ref><ref>[https://rockhall.com/inductees/elmore-james/bio/ Elmore James Biography], [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]</ref><ref>[[The Grammy Museum|Robert Santelli]] (1997), ''The Best of the Blues: The 101 Essential Albums'', [https://books.google.co.uk/books?ei=UKZiVYbxJcj5Usm-gMgC&id=vHvuAAAAMAAJ&q=%22blues+rock%22 page 377-378], [[Penguin Books]]</ref>

1963 marked the appearance of American rock guitar soloist [[Lonnie Mack]], whose idiosyncratic, fast-paced electric blues guitar style<ref>Guterman, The Best Rock 'N' Roll Records of All Time, 1992, Citadel Publishing, p. 34.</ref> came to be identified with the advent of blues rock as a distinct genre. His instrumentals from that period were recognizable as blues or [[rhythm and blues]] tunes, but he relied heavily upon fast-picking techniques derived from traditional American [[Country music|country]] and [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]] genres. The best-known of these are the 1963 [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']] hit singles "[[Memphis, Tennessee (song)|Memphis]]" and "Wham!".<ref>P. Prown, H. P. Newquist, J. F. Eiche, ''Legends of rock guitar: the essential reference of rock's greatest guitarists'' (Hal Leonard, 1997), p. 25.</ref>  Around the same time, the [[Paul Butterfield Blues Band]] was formed. Fronted by [[blues harp]] player and singer Paul Butterfield, it included two members from Howlin' Wolf's touring band, bassist [[Jerome Arnold]] and drummer [[Sam Lay]], and later two electric guitarists, [[Mike Bloomfield]] and [[Elvin Bishop]].<ref name="Erlewine">

[[AllMusic]]'s [[Michael Erlewine]] commented, "Used to hearing blues covered by groups like the Rolling Stones, that first album had an enormous impact on young (and primarily White) rock players."<ref name="Erlewine"/> The second album ''[[East-West (The Butterfield Blues Band album)|East West]]'' (1966) introduced extended soloing – the 13 minute instrumental title track included jazz and Indian [[raga]] influences – that served as a model for [[Psychedelic rock|psychedelic]] and [[acid rock]].<ref name="Erlewine"/>  In 1965, avid blues collectors [[Bob Hite]] and [[Alan Wilson (musician)|Alan Wilson]] formed [[Canned Heat]].  Their early recordings focused heavily on electric versions of [[Delta blues]] songs, but soon began exploring long [[musical improvisation]]s ("[[jam session|jams]]") built around [[John Lee Hooker]] songs.<ref name="Erlewine"/> Other popular mid-1960s groups, such as [[the Doors]] and [[Big Brother and the Holding Company]] with [[Janis Joplin]], also adapted songs by blues artists to include elements of rock.  Butterfield, Canned Heat, and Joplin performed at the [[Monterey Pop Festival|Monterey]] (1967) and [[Woodstock]] (1969) festivals.

In the UK, several musicians honed their skills in a handful of British blues bands, primarily those of [[Cyril Davies]] and [[Alexis Korner]].<ref name=Allmusicp700>V. Bogdanov, C. Woodstra, S. T.

The electric guitar playing of [[Jimi Hendrix]] (a veteran of many American [[rhythm and blues]] and [[Soul music|soul]] groups from the early-mid-1960s) and his [[power trios]], [[the Jimi Hendrix Experience]] and [[Band of Gypsys]], had a broad and lasting influence on the development of blues rock, especially for guitarists.<ref name=Allmusicp700/> Clapton continued to explore several musical styles and contributed to bringing blues rock into the mainstream.<ref name=Allmusicp700/>  In the late 1960s, [[Jeff Beck]], with his band the [[Jeff Beck Group]], developed blues rock into a form of heavy rock.<ref name=Allmusicp700/> [[Jimmy Page]], who replaced Beck in the Yardbirds, followed suit with [[Led Zeppelin]] and became a major force in the 1970s heavy metal scene.<ref name=Allmusicp700/> Other blues rock musicians in the 1970s include [[Dr. Feelgood (band)|Dr. Feelgood]], [[Rory Gallagher]] and [[Robin Trower]].

Beginning in the early 1970s, American bands such as [[Aerosmith]] fused blues with a hard rock edge. Blues rock grew to include [[Southern rock]] bands, like [[the Allman Brothers Band]], [[ZZ Top]] and [[Lynyrd Skynyrd]], while the British scene, except for the advent of groups such as [[Status Quo (band)|Status Quo]] and [[Foghat]], became focused on [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] innovation.<ref>P.
