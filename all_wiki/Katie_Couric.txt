==Television career==

===Career beginnings===
Couric's first job in 1979 was at the ABC News bureau in Washington, D.C., later joining [[CNN]] as an assignment editor. Between 1984 and 1986, she worked as a general-assignment reporter for the then-CBS affiliate [[WTVJ]] in [[Miami, Florida]].
During the following two years, she reported for [[WRC-TV]], the NBC owned- and -operated station in Washington, D.C., work which earned her an [[Associated Press]] award and an [[Emmy Award|Emmy]].<ref>Weller, ''The News Sorority'' (2015) pp. 110–29.</ref>

===NBC===

Couric joined ''[[NBC News]]'' in 1989 as Deputy [[The Pentagon|Pentagon]] Correspondent. From 1989 to 1991, Couric was an anchor substitute. She filled in for [[Bryant Gumbel]] as host of ''[[Today (NBC program)|Today]]'', [[Jane Pauley]], and [[Deborah Norville]] as co-anchor of ''Today'', [[Garrick Utley]], [[Mary Alice Williams]], and [[Maria Shriver]] as co-host of Sunday ''Today'', and [[John Palmer (TV journalist)|John Palmer]], Norville, and [[Faith Daniels]] as anchor of the former NBC News program ''[[NBC News at Sunrise]]''.

Couric returned to NBC to co-host the [[2018 Winter Olympics]] opening ceremonies with [[Mike Tirico]], and to provide additional Winter Olympic coverage and athlete interviews. During the opening ceremony she suggested, erroneously, that the Dutch use their skates as a normal mode of transportation during wintertime, prompting criticism and bemusement from the U.S. Embassy in the [[Netherlands]] and others. Couric apologized that her intended compliment didn't "come out" as intended, which the Embassy accepted, and invited her to the Netherlands for a tour.<ref>[https://www.cbssports.com/olympics/news/winter-olympics-katie-couric-apologizes-for-implying-that-the-dutch-skate-to-work/ Winter Olympics: Katie Couric apologizes for implying that the Dutch skate to work]; Kevin Skiver; [[CBS Sports]]; February 13, 2018</ref><ref>[https://www.cbssports.com/olympics/news/winter-olympics-2018-katie-couric-to-co-host-opening-ceremony-for-nbc/ 2018 Winter Olympics: Katie Couric to co-host Opening Ceremony for NBC]; Kevin Skiver; [[CBS Sports]]; January 17, 2018</ref>

On June 17, 1997, Couric asked the ''Washington Post''’s [[Bob Woodward]] about the [[Chinagate|Clinton "Chinagate" scandal]]: "Are members of the media, do you think, Bob, too scandal-obsessed, looking for something at every corner?"<ref>{{cite news |title=Not All Foreign-Influence Scandals Are Created Equal |url=https://www.nationalreview.com/2017/07/chinese-illegally-donated-bill-clinton-reelection-campaign-media-downplayed/ |work=[[National Review]] |date=July 16, 2017}}</ref>

Couric hosted or worked on a number of news specials, like ''Everybody's Business: America's Children'' in 1995. Similar entertainment specials were ''Legend to Legend Night: A Celebrity Cavalcade'' in 1993, and ''Harry Potter: Behind the Magic'' in 2001. Couric has also co-hosted the opening ceremonies of the [[Olympic Games]]. She has broadcast with [[Bob Costas]], beginning with the [[2000 Summer Olympics]].

Couric has interviewed many international political figures and celebrities, including presidents [[Gerald Ford]], [[Jimmy Carter]], [[George H. W. Bush]], [[Bill Clinton]] and [[George W. Bush]], and First Lady [[Barbara Bush]]. [[John F. Kennedy Jr.]] gave Couric his first and last interviews.

Couric has won multiple television reporting awards throughout her career, including the prestigious [[Peabody Award]] for her series ''Confronting Colon Cancer''.<ref>[http://www.peabodyawards.com/award-profile/katie-couric-confronting-colon-cancer 60th Annual Peabody Awards] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006133128/http://www.peabodyawards.com/award-profile/katie-couric-confronting-colon-cancer |date=October 6, 2014 }}, May 2001.</ref> Couric has also interviewed former British Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]], U.S. Secretary of State [[Hillary Rodham Clinton]] (her first television interview), [[Harry Potter]] author [[J.K.

On May 28, 2008, Couric made a return visit to ''[[Today (NBC program)|Today]]'' since leaving almost two years to the very day back on May 31, 2006. She made this appearance alongside her evening counterparts, [[NBC Nightly News]]' [[Brian Williams]] & [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] [[World News with Charles Gibson|World News]]' [[Charles Gibson]], to promote an organization called ''[[Stand Up to Cancer]]'' and raise cancer awareness on all three major television networks; [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], [[CBS]] & [[NBC]].

Couric was the lead reporter for two ''[[CBS Reports]]'' series, which aired across all [[CBS News]] platforms. The first series, "CBS Reports: Children of the Recession", highlighted the pain suffered by the youngest of the then ongoing Great Recession's victims. The series won the [[Columbia School of Journalism]]'s [[Alfred DuPont Award for Excellence in Journalism]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.journalism.columbia.edu/cs/ContentServer/jrn/1165270069766/page/1175295284582/JRNSimplePage2.htm |title=The Alfred I. duPont-Columbia University Awards&nbsp;– The Journalism School Columbia University |publisher=www.journalism.columbia.edu |accessdate=January 18, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100119041004/http://www.journalism.columbia.edu/cs/ContentServer/jrn/1165270069766/page/1175295284582/JRNSimplePage2.htm |archivedate=January 19, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> The second series, which aired in early 2010, was "CBS Reports: Where America Stands", which featured veteran CBS News correspondents reporting on major issues facing the United States in the decade ahead with research by the CBS News Polling Unit.

===Return to ABC News===

====ABC News (2011–2013)====
Couric was a special correspondent for [[ABC News]], based in New York, a role she has incorporated into her talk show. Her first appearance on the network was a [[Sarah Jessica Parker]] interview on ''[[Nightline]]''. Couric co-anchored coverage of the 10th anniversary of the [[September 11 attacks]], alongside [[Diane Sawyer]], [[Christiane Amanpour]], [[Barbara Walters]], [[Elizabeth Vargas]], [[George Stephanopoulos]], and [[Robin Roberts (newscaster)|Robin Roberts]]. Couric was hosting ''Today'' on ''[[NBC]]'' at the time of the attacks, and led [[CBS News]]'s coverage of the 5th anniversary. Couric also guest co-hosted ''[[The View (U.S. TV series)|The View]]'' and ''[[Live! with Kelly and Michael|Live! with Regis and Kelly]]''. Couric interviewed [[Lady Gaga]] in primetime on Thanksgiving as part of ''A Very Gaga Thanksgiving''. In November 2011, Couric hosted a special primetime ABC news program highlighting [[Regis Philbin]]'s retirement, after Philbin's 25-year tenure at ABC.

Similar to colleague [[Barbara Walters]], Couric anchors specials for the network and for the [[newsmagazine]] ''[[20/20 (U.S. TV series)|20/20]]''. While she contributes to the news program all throughout the year, in 2011, Couric created her newly annual special ''The Year with Katie Couric'', which is a program that marks the end of the year and covers some of the biggest newsmakers and news events of that year. This is a collaboration with ''[[People (magazine)|People]]'' magazine, which also reflects events in the world of news, sports, politics, and major headlines that helped shape the world. This is very similar to that of Walters's iconic ''Barbara Walters' 10 Most Fascinating People'', a year end program that marks the end of the year and acknowledges the people that had the most impact on the year at hand with interviews on their perspective of the year. As part of the special, Couric interviews fellow members of the media that can provide some insight on some events that occurred.

From April 2 to 6, 2012, Couric substituted for co-anchor Robin Roberts on ABC's ''[[Good Morning America]]'', her first stint at hosting a morning news show since leaving ''Today''.

====''Katie'' (2012–2014)====

The extended partnership secured Couric as having a spot in the ABC News division, as a special contributor.

In June 2017, after Verizon purchased Yahoo! and combined it into [[Verizon_Media | Oath]], Couric decided to end her contract at Yahoo!

Couric was dubbed "America's Sweetheart" largely due to her co-anchor role for 15 years on ''[[Today (NBC program)|The Today Show]]''.<ref>Katie Couric: Groundbreaking TV Journalist — Life Portraits; Rachel A. Koestler-Grack; Published by Gareth Stevens, 2009; p. 88</ref> On May 12, 2003, Couric guest-hosted ''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno]]'' as part of a swap campaign, and had 45 percent more viewers than on other nights.
