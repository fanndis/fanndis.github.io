The '''[[Academy of Country Music]] Awards''', also known as the '''ACM Awards''', were first held in 1966, honoring the industry's accomplishments during the previous year. It was the first [[country music]] awards program held by a major organization. The Academy's signature "hat" trophy was first created in 1968. The awards were first televised in 1972 on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]. In 1979, the Academy joined with [[Dick Clark Productions]] to produce the show. [[Dick Clark]] and [[Al Schwartz (producer)|Al Schwartz]] served as producers while Gene Weed served as director. Under their guidance, the show moved to [[NBC]] and finally to [[CBS]], where it remains today.<ref name="Mission">{{cite web|url=http://www.acmcountry.com/mission.html|title=Academy of Country Music Mission|work=acmcountry.com|accessdate=April 4, 2012}}</ref>

The Academy adopted a sleeker, modern version of the "hat" trophy in 2003, which is now made by the New York City firm [[Society Awards]]. In 2004, the organization implemented online awards voting for its professional members, becoming the first televised awards show to do so. [[Academy of Country Music Award for Entertainer of the Year|Entertainer of the Year]] was a fan-voted award for eight years, until 2016, when the ACM announced its decision to abandon Internet-voting for it and the three new-artist categories.

== Voting process ==
Voting members of the Academy of Country Music elect the nominees. In 2016, after an eight-year experiment intended to improve consumer engagement, the ACM announced its decision to abandon fan-voting for [[Academy of Country Music Award for Entertainer of the Year|Entertainer of the Year]] and its three new-artist categories, thanks to the cost of participation and several rifts that had developed among artists. The program was controversial from the start and included the web [[ballot stuffing]] encouragement infamous among awards of the same type presented in other ceremonies. [[Kenny Chesney]], after winning the first fan vote for entertainer in 2008, criticized the process backstage, complaining that instead of acknowledging artists' hard work, the vote had devolved into a marketing contest that rewarded people for "seeing how hard you can push people's buttons on the Internet." The winner, for example, of entertainer will now be voted on by the same people who select the male or female vocalist winner.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/country/6897296/acm-awards-fan-voting-removed-details-academy-music | title=Inside the ACM Awards' Decision to Abandon Fan Voting: Bickering Artists, Crafty Fans & 6-Figure Label Campaigns | work=Billboard | date=March 2, 2016 | accessdate=March 2, 2016 | author=Roland, Tom}}</ref>

==Awards==
The most prestigious awards are for "Artist of the Decade" and "Entertainer of the Year." There are a number of other awards to recognize male and female vocalists, albums, videos, songs, and musicians. The awards are typically presented in April or May and recognize achievement for the previous year.
