'''Sylvia Brustad''' (born 19 December 1966, in [[Elverum]]) is a former [[Norway|Norwegian]] politician for the [[Norwegian Labour Party]].

Brustad graduated from high school in 1983, and attended the media courses at the [[folk high school]] in [[Ringsaker]] until 1985. She then worked as a journalist, among other publications she worked for ''LO-aktuelt'', the news publication of the [[Norwegian Confederation of Trade Unions]].

Brustad was elected to a county council seat in [[Hedmark]] following the local elections of 1987. In the [[1989 Norwegian parliamentary election|1989 election]], she was elected to a seat in the [[Storting|Norwegian Parliament]] and left county politics.

In [[cabinet Jagland]] which held office between 1996 and 1997, she was [[Minister for Children and Family Affairs (Norway)|Minister for Children and Family Affairs]]. She was later [[Minister of Local Government and Regional Development (Norway)|Minister for Local Government and Regional Development]] in the [[first cabinet Stoltenberg]] between 2000 and 2001. Following the electoral victory of the [[2005 Norwegian parliamentary election|2005 elections]], Brustad became [[Minister of Health and Care Services (Norway)|Minister of Health and Care Services]] in the second cabinet Stoltenberg. She was moved to the post of Minister of Trade and Industry in June 2008 and left the government in October 2009.

Brustad became known for her role as Minister for Child and Family Affairs in 1996 when a law restricting the opening hours of shops on Sundays, holidays and after nine in the evening was passed. Only stores smaller than 100 square metres were allowed to remain open, such shops were somewhat disparagingly nicknamed ''"Brustadbuer"'' ("Brustad shacks"), until the law was quietly repealed in 2003.<ref>[http://onlinemagasinet.no/artikkel.php?KatID=1&ArtID=1106 Ingen har merket at Brustadbua forsvant] (Nobody noticed that the Brustadbu disapperared, onlinmagasinet.no, published 11 June 2003</ref> Brustad herself claimed that she had not personally advocated the law, but that she was required to follow through on a decision within the Labour Party.<ref>[http://www.aftenposten.no/nyheter/iriks/politikk/article364165.ece Brustad angrer "Brustad-bua"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604032250/http://www.aftenposten.no/nyheter/iriks/politikk/article364165.ece |date=2011-06-04 }} (Brustad regrets the ''Brustadbua'') Aftenposten 15 July 2002</ref>
