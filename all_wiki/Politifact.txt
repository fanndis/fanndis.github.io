'''PolitiFact.com''' is a [[Nonprofit organization|nonprofit project]] operated by the [[Poynter Institute]] in [[St. Petersburg, Florida]], with offices there and in [[Washington, D.C.]] It began in 2007 as a project of the ''[[Tampa Bay Times]]'' (then the ''St. Petersburg Times''), with reporters and editors from the [[newspaper]] and its affiliated news media partners reporting on the accuracy of statements made by elected officials, candidates, their staffs, lobbyists, interest groups and others involved in [[U.S. politics]].<ref>{{cite news |title=PolitiFact.com |newspaper=St. Petersburg Times |url=http://www.politifact.com |accessdate=August 16, 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100815184905/http://www.politifact.com/ |archivedate=August 15, 2010}}</ref> Its journalists evaluate original statements and publish their findings on the PolitiFact.com website, where each statement receives a "Truth-O-Meter" rating. The ratings range from "True" for statements the journalists deems as accurate to "Pants on Fire" (from the taunt "Liar, liar, pants on fire") for claims the journalists deems as false or ludicrous.

'''PunditFact''', a related site that was also created by the ''Times''{{'}} editors, is devoted to [[fact-checking]] claims made by [[political pundit]]s.<ref>{{cite web |last=Adair |first=Bill |title=Principles of PolitiFact, PunditFact and the Truth-O-Meter |url=http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2013/nov/01/principles-politifact-punditfact-and-truth-o-meter/ |work=PolitiFact |accessdate=April 12, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140418155938/http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2013/nov/01/principles-politifact-punditfact-and-truth-o-meter/ |archivedate=April 18, 2014 }}</ref> Both PolitiFact and PunditFact were funded primarily by the ''Tampa Bay Times'' and ad revenues generated on the website until 2018, and the ''Times'' continues to sell ads for the site now that it is part of Poynter, a non-profit organization that also owns the newspaper.

PolitiFact has won several awards, and has been both praised and criticized by independent observers, conservatives and liberals alike.

== History ==
PolitiFact.com was started in August 2007 by ''Times'' Washington Bureau Chief [[Bill Adair (journalist)|Bill Adair]], in conjunction with the ''[[Congressional Quarterly]]''. 

In January 2010, PolitiFact.com expanded to its second newspaper, the [[Cox Enterprises]] –owned ''[[Austin American-Statesman]]'' in [[Austin, Texas]]; the feature, called PolitiFact Texas, covers issues that are relevant to Texas and the Austin area.

In March 2010, the Times and its partner newspaper, ''[[The Miami Herald]]'', launched PolitiFact Florida, which focuses on Florida issues. The Times and the Herald share resources on some stories that relate to Florida.

Since then, PolitiFact.com expanded to other papers, such as ''[[The Atlanta Journal-Constitution]]'', ''[[The Providence Journal]]'', ''[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]]'', ''[[The Plain Dealer]]'', ''[[Richmond Times-Dispatch]]'', the ''[[Knoxville News Sentinel]]'' and ''[[The Oregonian]]''.
The ''[[Knoxville News Sentinel]]'' ended its relationship with PolitiFact.com after 2012.<ref>{{cite web |last=McElroy |first=Jack |title=News Sentinel dropping out of PolitiFact |url=http://blogs.knoxnews.com/editor/2012/12/news-sentinel-dropping-politif.shtml |work=Knoxnews.com |publisher=The E.W.

In 2013, Adair was named Knight Professor of the Practice of Journalism and Public Policy at [[Duke University]], and stepped down as Bureau Chief at the ''Times'' and as editor at PolitiFact.com.<ref name="duke">[http://today.duke.edu/2013/04/adair Bill Adair, PolitiFact Editor, Named Knight Professor at Duke] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170405174656/https://today.duke.edu/2013/04/adair |date=April 5, 2017 }}; April 5, 2013</ref> The ''Tampa Bay Times''' senior reporter, Alex Leary, succeeded Bill Adair as Bureau Chief on July 1, 2013,<ref name="duke" /> and Angie Drobnic Holan was appointed editor of PolitiFact in October 2013.

In 2014, ''The Plain Dealer'' ended its partnership with PolitiFact.com after they reduced their news staff and were unwilling to meet "the required several PolitiFact investigations per week".<ref>{{cite web |last=Diadiun |first=Ted |title=Coming: Truth squad reporting without the gimmicks |url=http://www.cleveland.com/readers/index.ssf/2014/01/coming_truth_squad_reporting_w.html#incart_river |work=Cleveland Plain Dealer |publisher=Northeast Ohio Media Group LLC |accessdate=April 12, 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140413124640/http://www.cleveland.com/readers/index.ssf/2014/01/coming_truth_squad_reporting_w.html#incart_river |archivedate=April 13, 2014}}</ref>

== "Lie of the Year" ==
Since 2009, PolitiFact.com has declared one political statement from each year to be the "Lie of the Year."

; 2009
In December 2009, they declared the Lie of the Year to be [[Sarah Palin]]'s assertion that the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] of 2009 would lead to government "[[death panel]]s" that dictated which types of patients would receive treatment.<ref>[http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2009/dec/18/politifact-lie-year-death-panels/ PolitiFact's Lie of the Year: 'Death panels'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091222005854/http://politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2009/dec/18/politifact-lie-year-death-panels/ |date=December 22, 2009 }}, Angie Drobnic Holan, ''PolitiFact.com'', December 18, 2009</ref>

; 2010
In December 2010, PolitiFact.com dubbed the Lie of the Year to be the contention among some opponents of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act that it represented a "government takeover of healthcare". PolitiFact.com argued that this was not the case, since all health care and insurance would remain in the hands of private companies.<ref>[http://politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2010/dec/16/lie-year-government-takeover-health-care/ PolitiFact's Lie of the Year: 'A government takeover of health care'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101219102053/http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2010/dec/16/lie-year-government-takeover-health-care/ |date=December 19, 2010 }}, Bill Adair and Angie Drobnic Holan, ''PolitiFact.com'', December 16, 2010</ref>

; 2011
PolitiFact's Lie of the Year for 2011 was a statement by the [[Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee]] (DCCC) that a 2011 budget proposal by Congressman [[Paul Ryan]], entitled ''[[The Path to Prosperity]]'' and voted for overwhelmingly by Republicans in the House and Senate, meant that "Republicans voted to end [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]]".<ref>[http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2011/dec/20/lie-year-democrats-claims-republicans-voted-end-me/ Lie of the Year 2011: 'Republicans voted to end Medicare'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170815214802/http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2011/dec/20/lie-year-democrats-claims-republicans-voted-end-me/ |date=August 15, 2017 }}, ''PolitiFact.com'', December 20, 2011</ref> PolitiFact determined that, though it is true the Republican plan would change Medicare fundamentally by forcing the elderly to use private health plans - the very thing Medicare was intended to substitute for - a radically transformed program could still be termed "Medicare" so it was not technically true that "Republicans voted to end Medicare". PolitiFact had originally labeled nine similar statements as "false" or "pants on fire" since April 2011.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/apr/20/democratic-congressional-campaign-committee/democrats-say-republicans-voted-end-medicare-and-c/ |title=Democrats say Republicans voted to end Medicare and charge seniors $12,000 |publisher=PolitiFact |date=April 20, 2011 |accessdate=December 22, 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111212233805/http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/apr/20/democratic-congressional-campaign-committee/democrats-say-republicans-voted-end-medicare-and-c/ |archivedate=December 12, 2011}}</ref>

PolitiFact.com was awarded the [[Pulitzer Prize for National Reporting]] in 2009 for "its fact-checking initiative during the 2008 presidential campaign that used probing reporters and the power of the World Wide Web to examine more than 750 political claims, separating rhetoric from truth to enlighten voters".<ref>[http://www.pulitzer.org/citation/2009-National-Reporting The 2009 Pulitzer Prize Winners] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090919173210/http://www.pulitzer.org/citation/2009-National-Reporting |date=September 19, 2009 }} Retrieved August 16, 2010.</ref>

A ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' opinion editorial by [[Joseph Rago]] in December 2010 called PolitiFact "part of a larger journalistic trend that seeks to recast all political debates as matters of lies, misinformation and 'facts,' rather than differences of world view or principles".<ref name="politifiction">{{cite news |date=December 23, 2010 |title=PolitiFiction: True 'Lies' about Obamacare |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703886904576031630593433102 |url-status=live |newspaper=The Wall Street Journal |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150201174133/http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703886904576031630593433102 |archive-date=February 1, 2015 |quote=PolitiFact's decree is part of a larger journalistic trend that seeks to recast all political debates as matters of lies, misinformation and 'facts,' rather than differences of world view or principles. ...

TV critic [[James Poniewozik]] at ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' characterized PolitiFact as having the "hard-earned and important position as referee in the mudslinging contest—a 'truth vigilante,' as it were", and "PolitiFact is trying to do the right thing here. And despite the efforts of partisans to work the refs by complaining about various calls they’ve made in the past, they’re generally doing a hard, important thing well. They often do it better than the rest of the political media, and the political press owes them for doing it." Poniewozik also suggested, "they need to improve their rating system, to address the irresponsible, the unprovable, the dubious. Otherwise, they’re doing exactly what they were founded to stop: using language to spread false impressions."<ref name="poniewozik">{{cite news |last=Poniewozik |first=James |date=August 8, 2012 |title=PolitiFact, Harry Reid's Pants, and the Limits of Fact-Checking |url=http://entertainment.time.com/2012/08/08/politifact-harry-reids-pants-and-the-limits-of-fact-checking/ |magazine=Time |quote=But if their rating system—designed, ironically, to abet the truth by making it as easy to spread via catchphrase as a lie—is sending false messages, then they need to improve their rating system, to address the irresponsible, the unprovable, the dubious.

Mark Hemingway of ''[[The Weekly Standard]]'' criticized all fact-checking projects by news organizations, including PolitiFact, the [[Associated Press]] and the ''[[Washington Post]]'', writing that they "aren't about checking facts so much as they are about a rearguard action to keep inconvenient truths out of the conversation".<ref>[http://www.weeklystandard.com/articles/lies-damned-lies-and-fact-checking_611854.html?nopager=1 Lies, Damned Lies, and ‘Fact Checking’] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120105035815/http://www.weeklystandard.com/articles/lies-damned-lies-and-fact-checking_611854.html?nopager=1 |date=January 5, 2012 }}, Mark Hemingway, ''[[The Weekly Standard]]'', December 19, 2011</ref>

In February 2011, [[University of Minnesota]] political science professor Eric Ostermeier analyzed 511 PolitiFact stories issued from January 2010 through January 2011. He found that the number of statements analyzed from Republicans and from Democrats was comparable, but Republicans have been assigned substantially harsher grades, receiving 'false' or 'pants on fire' more than three times as often as Democrats. Ostermeier suggested that this may indicate a bias in the selection of statements to analyze, concluding: "The question is not whether PolitiFact will ultimately convert skeptics on the right that they do not have ulterior motives in the selection of what statements are rated, but whether the organization can give a convincing argument that either a) Republicans in fact do lie much more than Democrats, or b) if they do not, that it is immaterial that PolitiFact covers political discourse with a frame that suggests this is the case."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://editions.lib.umn.edu/smartpolitics/2011/02/10/selection-bias-politifact-rate/ |title=Selection Bias?

In December 2011, [[Northeastern University]] journalism professor Dan Kennedy wrote in the ''[[Huffington Post]]'' that the problem with fact-checking projects was "there are only a finite number of statements that can be subjected to thumbs-up/thumbs-down fact-checking".<ref>[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dan-kennedy/politifact-and-the-limits_b_1144876.html PolitiFact and the Limits of Fact-Checking] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120317165414/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dan-kennedy/politifact-and-the-limits_b_1144876.html |date=March 17, 2012 }}, Dan Kennedy, ''[[Huffington Post]]'', December 13, 2011.</ref>

[[Matt Welch]], in the February 2013 issue of ''[[Reason (magazine)|Reason]]'' magazine, criticized PolitiFact and other media fact-checkers for focusing much more on statements by politicians about their opponents, rather than statements by politicians and government officials about their own policies, thus serving as "a check on the exercise of rhetoric" but not "a check on the exercise of power".<ref>{{cite web |first=Matt |last=Welch |url=http://reason.com/archives/2013/01/07/the-truth-hurts/1 |title=The ‘Truth’ Hurts: How the fact-checking press gives the president a pass |work=Reason |date=February 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130120170109/http://reason.com/archives/2013/01/07/the-truth-hurts/1 |archivedate=January 20, 2013}}</ref>
