'''Powerade''' is  a [[sports drink]] created, manufactured and marketed by [[The Coca-Cola Company]]. Its primary competitor is [[Gatorade]], made by [[PepsiCo]].

==History==
{{refimprove section|date=May 2010}}
In 1988, Powerade became the official sports drink of the [[Olympic Games|Olympics]], alongside [[Aquarius (sports drink)|Aquarius]], another sports drink made by Coca-Cola. It is a rival of another sports drink, Gatorade.<ref name="cocacola españa">[http://www.conocepepsecola.com/default.cfm Coca-Cola English&nbsp;– Productos] {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>
In July 2001, The Coca-Cola Company launched a new formula for Powerade including vitamins B<sub>3</sub>, B<sub>6</sub> and B<sub>12</sub>, which play a role in energy metabolism.<ref name="foodaq">{{cite web|url=http://www.foodaq.com/html/Non-Alcoholic-Drinks/36447.html|title=Powerade vs. soda? - FoodAQ|work=foodaq.com|accessdate=6 April 2015}}</ref>

In July 2002, The Coca-Cola Company updated the bottles of the standard Powerade (previous logo styling) to a new sport-grip [[bottle]].

In 2002, The Coca-Cola Company introduced Powerade Option to the [[United States]], in response to Gatorade's popular [[Propel Fitness Water|Propel]]. Option is a "low Calorie sports drink" that is colorless and sweetened with [[high fructose corn syrup]], [[sucralose]], and [[acesulfame potassium]], to provide sugar-conscious consumers with another rehydration choice. Powerade Option took 36% of the Fitness Water category behind Propel's 42%.

In 2007, Powerade Zero was released,  a sports drink with [[electrolytes]], which contains no sugar, no calories and no carbohydrates.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://avenueform.com/best-sports-drinks/|title=Best Sports Drinks|author=Kristin Goett|date=June 9, 2016|accessdate=June 23, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160811063724/http://avenueform.com/best-sports-drinks/|archive-date=August 11, 2016|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref name="USA Today article">{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/food/2008-05-06-powerade-zero_N.htm|title=PowerAde's zero-calorie sports drink takes on Gatorade&nbsp;— USATODAY.com|work=usatoday.com|accessdate=6 April 2015}}</ref> Powerade Option was subsequently discontinued.<ref name="adweek">{{cite web|url=http://www.adweek.com/aw/content_display/news/client/e3i43f8401a4817748c80be9b9e19d11174|title=Adweek: How Powerade Downed Gatorade in Court, August 6, 2009|publisher=|accessdate=28 October 2017}}</ref>

In June 2009, The Coca-Cola Company bought [[Glacéau]], owner of brands such as VitaminWater and SmartWater, for $4.1 billion, a price tag that signaled the company's seriousness in pursuing growth of non-carbonated beverages. Since then, the company has also given its Glacéau management team control of its Powerade sports drink brand.{{citation needed|date=May 2020}}

==Competition==
Powerade's main competition is [[Gatorade]] marketed by the [[Quaker Oats Company]], a division of [[PepsiCo]].  Gatorade, which was branded at the University of Florida in 1965, was the first commercially available sports drink in the United States. It now holds a commanding share of the market. As of 2011, Gatorade held a 70% market share to Powerade's 28.5%.<ref name="AdAge Article">{{cite web|url=http://adage.com/article/news/watch-spot-2-powerade-launches-underdog-campaign/233082/|title=Watch the Spot: No. 2 Powerade Launches 'Underdog' Campaign - News - Advertising Age|author=Shareen Pathak.|date=2 March 2012|work=adage.com|accessdate=6 April 2015}}</ref>

[[All Sport]] is a competitor marketed by All Sport, Inc. and distributed by the Dr. Pepper Snapple Group. All Sport was marketed by PepsiCo until 2001, when Gatorade's maker, the [[Quaker Oats Company]] was acquired by PepsiCo. All Sport was sold to the Monarch Beverage Company soon after. Powerade and All Sport have each been distributed through their own direct store deliver channels.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Assessing the Consequences of a Channel Switch|jstor = 40057143|journal = Marketing Science|date = 2008-05-01|pages = 398–416|volume = 27|issue = 3|first1 = Xinlei (Jack)|last1 = Chen|first2 = George|last2 = John|first3 = Om|last3 = Narasimhan|doi=10.1287/mksc.1070.0311}}</ref> It was subsequently purchased by Gary Smith, the Chairman & CEO of All Sport, Inc. of Austin, Texas.

Outside the United States, the [[Lucozade]] [[energy drink]] (manufactured since 1927 by the pharmaceutical company now known as [[GlaxoSmithKline]]) competes with Powerade. Lucozade's formulation differs in that it uses primarily [[glucose]] and contains caffeine. The more direct competitor to Powerade and Gatorade is Lucozade Sport.

==Criticism==
Like its main competitor, Gatorade, Powerade is made with sugar, syrups and salt.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/22/business/22soda.html?ex=1186372800&en=6331daea5be3b848&ei=5070|title=Critics Say Soda Policy for Schools Lacks Teeth|author=Melanie Warner|work=New York Times|date=August 22, 2005}}</ref>
One Powerade [[ad campaign]] saying that Powerade ION4 is superior to Gatorade has been accused of being deceptive and false by Pepsi, the parent owner of [[Gatorade]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0603/21/sitroom.02.html| work=CNN|title=CNN.com}}</ref> The courts ruled in favor of Powerade as of August 2009.
