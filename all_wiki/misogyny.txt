'''Misogyny''' ({{IPAc-en|m|ɪ|ˈ|s|ɒ|dʒ|ɪ|n|i}}) is the hatred of, contempt for, or prejudice against [[Woman|women]] or [[girl]]s. It enforces [[sexism]] by punishing those who reject an inferior status for women and rewarding those who accept it. Misogyny manifests in numerous ways, including [[social exclusion]], [[sex discrimination]], [[hostility]], [[androcentrism]], [[patriarchy]], [[male privilege]], belittling of women, disenfranchisement of women, [[violence against women]], and [[sexual objectification]].<ref name="Code2000">{{cite book|last=Code|first=Lorraine|title=Encyclopedia of Feminist Theories|year=2000|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=978-0-415-13274-9|edition=1st|page=[https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaoffe0000unse/page/346 346]|url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaoffe0000unse/page/346}}</ref><ref name="Kramarae2000">{{cite book|last=Kramarae|first=Cheris|title=Routledge International Encyclopedia of Women|year=2000|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=978-0-415-92088-9|pages=1374–1377}}</ref>

Misogyny has existed throughout history. It was noted as a disease in [[Classical Greece]].<ref name="Cicero" /> It became a common term in the English language in 2012.<ref name=":1" /> Misogyny can be found within [[Religious text|sacred texts]] of [[religion]]s, [[Mythology|mythologies]], and [[Western philosophy]]<ref name="Code2000" /><ref name="Clack1999" /> and [[Eastern philosophy]]. Many misogynstic ideas have also been documented through the work of different western thinkers, such as [[Aristotle]].<ref name="Smith 467–478" />

Misogyny can lead to both physical and psychological violence. Physical violence instances include misogynist terrorism and [[domestic violence]], as well as a relationship between misogyny and [[white supremacy]].<ref name="Valenti2018" /><ref name=":3" /><ref name=":4" /> Misogyny on the [[Internet]] has also increased over time, often in the form of coordinated attacks.<ref name="jane" /> There is also a trend in similar, stereotyping language being used in this online misogyny.<ref name="jane" /> Psychological violence, such as internalized misogyny, [[abuse]], and [[harassment]], also correlate with misogyny.<ref name=":5" /><ref name="autogenerated1" /> Misogyny has been criticized in various ways, such as the interpretation of misogyny in [[second-wave feminism]],<ref name=":10" /> and the idea that men fear women instead of hating them.<ref name=":11" /> It is the opposite of [[philogyny]].<ref name=":12" />

[[Feminist theory]] touches on different aspects of misogyny, such as the notion of "good" versus "bad" women, the patriarchal bargain, and contempt for the feminine. "Good" versus "bad" women is a concept used to control women and further the misogyny they experience by categorizing women based on their response to their own [[oppression]].<ref name=":6" /> 

== Definitions ==
According to sociologist [[Allan G. Johnson]], "misogyny is a cultural attitude of hatred for females because they are female". Johnson argues that:
{{quote|Misogyny .... is a central part of sexist prejudice and ideology and, as such, is an important basis for the [[oppression]] of females in male-dominated societies. Misogyny is manifested in many different ways, from jokes to pornography to violence to the self-contempt women may be taught to feel toward their own bodies.<ref>{{Cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=V1kiW7x6J1MC&q=allan+johnson+misogyny&pg=PA197 | title = The Blackwell dictionary of sociology: A user's guide to sociological language | isbn = 978-0-631-21681-0 | last1 = Johnson | first1 = Allan G | year = 2000 | accessdate = November 21, 2011}}, ("ideology" in all small capitals in original).</ref>}}

Sociologist [[Michael Flood]] at the [[University of Wollongong]] defines misogyny as the hatred of women, and notes:
{{quote|Though most common in men, misogyny also exists in and is practiced by women against other women or even themselves. Misogyny functions as an ideology or belief system that has accompanied patriarchal, or male-dominated societies for thousands of years and continues to place women in subordinate positions with limited access to power and decision making. […] Aristotle contended that women exist as natural deformities or imperfect males […] Ever since, women in [[Western culture]]s have internalised their role as societal scapegoats, influenced in the twenty-first century by multimedia objectification of women with its culturally sanctioned self-loathing and fixations on plastic surgery, anorexia and bulimia.<ref>{{Cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=EUON2SYps-QC&q=michael+flood+misogyny&pg=PA444 | title = International encyclopedia of men and masculinities | isbn = 978-0-415-33343-6 | last1 = Flood | first1 = Michael | date = July 18, 2007}}</ref>}}

[[File:Seated Euripides Louvre Ma343.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Euripides]]]]

In his book ''City of Sokrates: An Introduction to Classical Athens'', J.W. Roberts argues that older than tragedy and comedy was a misogynistic tradition in Greek literature, reaching back at least as far as [[Hesiod]].<ref>{{Cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=73kTsV4FdrQC&q=Sokrates+misogyny+misogynist&pg=PA22 | title = City of Sokrates: An Introduction to Classical Athens | isbn = 978-0-203-19479-9 | last1 = Roberts | first1 = J.W | date = 2002-06-01}}</ref> The term ''misogyny'' itself comes directly into English from the Ancient Greek word ''misogunia'' ({{lang|grc|μισογυνία}}), which survives in several passages.

The earlier, longer, and more complete passage comes from a moral tract known as ''On Marriage'' (''c''. 150 BC) by the [[Stoicism|stoic]] philosopher [[Antipater of Tarsus]].<ref>The ''[[editio princeps]]'' is on page 255 of volume three of ''[[Stoicorum Veterum Fragmenta]]'' (''SVF'', Old Stoic Fragments), see [[#External links|External links]].</ref><ref name="Deming">A recent critical text with translation is in [https://books.google.com/books?id=u_6a-sMDv6AC&pg=PA221&lpg=PA221&dq=appendix+a+antipater+of+tarsus&source=web&ots=JlCnsyRBGf&sig=7zsKzMVEBnV3tHag9z7E4cWCeLs&hl=en Appendix A] to Will Deming, ''Paul on Marriage and Celibacy: The Hellenistic Background of 1 Corinthians 7'', pp. 221–226.

''Misogunia'' appears in the [[accusative case]] on page 224 of Deming, as the fifth word in line 33 of his Greek text.
It is split over lines 25–26 in von Arnim.</ref> Antipater argues that marriage is the foundation of the state, and considers it to be based on divine ([[Polytheism|polytheistic]]) decree. He uses ''misogunia'' to describe the sort of writing the tragedian [[Euripides]] eschews, stating that he "reject[s] the hatred of women in his writing" (ἀποθέμενος τὴν ἐν τῷ γράφειν μισογυνίαν).  He then offers an example of this, quoting from a lost play of Euripides in which the merits of a dutiful wife are praised.<ref name="Deming" /><ref>38-43, fr. 63, in von Arnim, J. (ed.). ''Stoicorum Veterum Fragmenta.'' Vol. 3. Leipzig: Teubner, 1903.</ref> 

The other surviving use of the original Greek word is by [[Chrysippus]], in a fragment from ''On affections'', quoted by [[Galen]] in ''[[Hippocrates]] on Affections''.<ref>''SVF'' 3:103. ''Misogyny'' is the first word on the page.</ref> Here, ''misogyny'' is the first in a short list of three "disaffections"—women (''misogunia''), wine (''misoinia'', μισοινία) and humanity (''misanthrōpia'', μισανθρωπία). Chrysippus' point is more abstract than Antipater's, and Galen quotes the passage as an example of an opinion contrary to his own. What is clear, however, is that he groups hatred of women with hatred of humanity generally, and even hatred of wine. "It was the prevailing medical opinion of his day that wine strengthens body and soul alike."<ref name=Tieleman>Teun L. Tieleman, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=BBiw96gj8gkC&printsec=frontcover&dq=chrysippus+on+affections&sig=6f6Y84rR_VZzorWxiGfFMYViuvM Chrysippus' on Affections:] Reconstruction and Interpretations'', (Leiden: [[Brill Publishers]], 2003), p. 162. {{ISBN|90-04-12998-7}}</ref> So Chrysippus, like his fellow stoic Antipater, views misogyny negatively, as a [[disease]]; a dislike of something that is good. It is this issue of conflicted or alternating emotions that was philosophically contentious to the ancient writers. Ricardo Salles suggests that the general stoic view was that "[a] man may not only alternate between philogyny and misogyny, philanthropy and misanthropy, but be prompted to each by the other."<ref>Ricardo Salles, ''Metaphysics, Soul, and Ethics in Ancient Thought: Themes from the Work of Richard Sorabji'', (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 2005), 485.</ref>

[[Aristotle]] has also been accused of being a misogynist; he has written that women were inferior to men. According to [[Cynthia Freeland]] (1994):

{{quote|Aristotle says that the courage of a man lies in commanding, a woman's lies in obeying; that 'matter yearns for form, as the female for the male and the ugly for the beautiful'; that women have fewer teeth than men; that a female is an incomplete male or 'as it were, a deformity': which contributes only matter and not form to the generation of offspring; that in general 'a woman is perhaps an inferior being'; that female characters in a tragedy will be inappropriate if they are too brave or too clever[.]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminism-femhist/#Mis |title=Feminist History of Philosophy (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy) |publisher=Plato.stanford.edu |accessdate=2013-10-01}}</ref>}}

In the ''Routledge philosophy guidebook to Plato and the Republic'', Nickolas Pappas describes the "problem of misogyny" and states:

{{quote|In the ''Apology'', Socrates calls those who plead for their lives in court "no better than women" (35b)... The ''Timaeus'' warns men that if they live immorally they will be reincarnated as women (42b-c; cf. 75d-e). The ''Republic'' contains a number of comments in the same spirit (387e, 395d-e, 398e, 431b-c, 469d), evidence of nothing so much as of contempt toward women. Even Socrates' words for his bold new proposal about marriage... suggest that the women are to be "held in common" by men. He never says that the men might be held in common by the women... We also have to acknowledge Socrates' insistence that men surpass women at any task that both sexes attempt (455c, 456a), and his remark in Book 8 that one sign of democracy's moral failure is the sexual equality it promotes (563b).<ref>{{Cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=VujWajIWxkUC&q=Socrates+misogyny+misogynist&pg=PA109 | title = Routledge philosophy guidebook to Plato and the Republic | isbn = 978-0-415-29996-1 | last1 = Pappas | first1 = Nickolas | date = 2003-09-09}}</ref>}}

''Misogynist'' is also found in the Greek—''misogunēs'' ({{lang|grc|μισογύνης}})—in ''Deipnosophistae'' (above) and in [[Plutarch]]'s ''Parallel Lives'', where it is used as the title of [[Heracles]] in the history of [[Phocion]]. It was the title of a play by [[Menander]], which we know of from book seven (concerning [[Alexandria]]) of [[Strabo]]'s 17 volume ''[[Geographica|Geography]]'',<ref name="Liddell">[[Henry George Liddell]] and [[Robert Scott (philologist)|Robert Scott]], ''[[A Greek–English Lexicon]]'' (''LSJ''), revised and augmented by Henry Stuart Jones and Roderick McKenzie, (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1940). {{ISBN|0-19-864226-1}}</ref><ref>[[Strabo]],''[[Geographica (Strabo)|Geography]]'', Book 7 [Alexandria] Chapter 3.</ref> and quotations of Menander by [[Clement of Alexandria]] and [[Stobaeus]] that relate to marriage.<ref>[[Menander]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=JC11wYBkrhkC&pg=PA268&dq=The+Misogynist+(Misogynes)&sig=y98In1TUseOWVGHrcOOMQ0Vx1dU ''The Plays and Fragments''], translated by Maurice Balme, contributor [[Peter G.

[[File:CiceroBust.jpg|thumb|[[Cicero|Marcus Tullius Cicero]]]]
Cicero reports that Greek philosophers considered misogyny to be caused by [[gynophobia]], a fear of women.<ref name="Cicero">[[Cicero|Marcus Tullius Cicero]], ''[[Tusculanae Quaestiones]]'', Book 4, Chapter 11.</ref>

{{quote|It is the same with other diseases; as the desire of glory, a passion for women, to which the Greeks give the name of ''philogyneia'': and thus all other diseases and sicknesses are generated. But those feelings which are the contrary of these are supposed to have fear for their foundation, as a hatred of women, such as is displayed in the ''Woman-hater'' of Atilius; or the hatred of the whole human species, as Timon is reported to have done, whom they call the Misanthrope. Of the same kind is inhospitality. And all these diseases proceed from a certain dread of such things as they hate and avoid.<ref name="Cicero" />|Cicero|''[[Tusculanae Quaestiones]]'', 1st century BC.}}

In summary, Greek literature considered misogyny to be a [[disease]]—an [[anti-social behaviour|anti-social]] condition—in that it ran contrary to their perceptions of the value of women as wives and of the family as the foundation of society. These points are widely noted in the secondary literature.<ref name="Deming" />

[[File:Julia_Gillard_2010.jpg|thumb|left|[[Julia Gillard]]]]

According to the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] the word entered English because of an anonymous [[proto-feminist]] play, ''[[Swetnam the Woman-Hater]]'', published in 1620 in England.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |title=misogynist |encyclopedia=Oxford English Dictionary |publisher=Oxford University Press |url=https://www.oed.com/view/Entry/119828?redirectedFrom=misogynist }}</ref> The play is a criticism of anti-woman writer [[Joseph Swetnam]], who it represents with the pseudonym Misogynos.

The term was fairly rare until the mid-1970s. The publication of [[feminist]] [[Andrea Dworkin]]'s 1974 critique ''[[Woman Hating]]'' popularized the idea. The term misogyny entered the lexicon of [[second-wave feminism]]. Dworkin and her contemporaries used the term to include not only a hatred or contempt of women, but the practice of controlling women with violence and punishing women who reject subordination.<ref name="Aron2019" />

Misogyny was discussed worldwide in 2012 because of a [[viral video]] of a speech by Australian Prime Minister [[Julia Gillard]]. Her parliamentary address is known as the [[Misogyny Speech]]. In the speech, Gillard powerfully criticized her opponents for holding her policies to a [[double standard|different standard]] than those of male politicians, and for speaking about her in crudely sexual terms.<ref name=":1">{{cite news |last=Lester |first=Amelia |date=October 9, 2012 |title=Ladylike: Julia Gillard's Misogyny Speech |work=The New Yorker |url=https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/ladylike-julia-gillards-misogyny-speech|access-date=July 27, 2020 }}</ref>

Gillard's usage of the word "misogyny" promoted re-evaluations of the word's published definitions. The ''[[Macquarie Dictionary]]'' revised its definition in 2012 to better match the way the word has been used over the prior 30 years.<ref>{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |agency=Reuters |date=October 17, 2012 |title=Dictionary changes 'misogyny' definition after Australian PM's furious attack on conservative leader |url=https://nationalpost.com/news/dictionary-changes-definition-of-misogyny-after-australian-pms-furious-attack-on-conservative-leader |work=[[National Post]] |access-date=August 17, 2020 }}</ref> The book ''[[Down Girl]]'', which reconsidered the definition using the tools of [[analytic philosophy]], was inspired in part by Gillard.<ref name="Manne2019" />{{rp|83}}

=== Ancient Greek ===
In ''Misogyny: The World's Oldest Prejudice'', [[Jack Holland (writer)|Jack Holland]] argues that there is evidence of misogyny in the [[mythology]] of the ancient world. In [[Greek mythology]] according to Hesiod, the human race had already experienced a peaceful, autonomous existence as a companion to the gods before the creation of women. When [[Prometheus]] decides to steal the secret of fire from the gods, [[Zeus]] becomes infuriated and decides to punish humankind with an "evil thing for their delight". This "evil thing" is [[Pandora]], the first woman, who carried a jar (usually described—incorrectly—as a box) which she was told to never open. [[Epimetheus (mythology)|Epimetheus]] (the brother of Prometheus) is overwhelmed by her beauty, disregards Prometheus' warnings about her, and marries her. Pandora cannot resist peeking into the jar, and by opening it she unleashes into the world all evil; [[childbirth|labour]], [[Illness|sickness]], [[old age]], and [[death]].<ref>Holland, J: ''Misogyny: The World's Oldest Prejudice'', pp. 12–13.

In his book ''The Power of Denial: Buddhism, Purity, and Gender'', professor Bernard Faure of [[Columbia University]] argued generally that "Buddhism is paradoxically neither as sexist nor as egalitarian as is usually thought." He remarked, "Many feminist scholars have emphasized the misogynistic (or at least androcentric) nature of Buddhism" and stated that Buddhism morally exalts its male monks while the mothers and wives of the monks also have important roles. Additionally, he wrote:
{{quote|While some scholars see Buddhism as part of a movement of emancipation, others see it as a source of oppression. Perhaps this is only a distinction between optimists and pessimists, if not between idealists and realists...

Differences in tradition and interpretations of scripture have caused sects of [[Christianity]] to differ in their beliefs with regard to their treatment of women.

In ''The Troublesome Helpmate'', Katharine M. Rogers argues that Christianity is misogynistic, and she lists what she says are specific examples of misogyny in the [[Pauline epistles]]. She states:

{{quote|The foundations of early Christian misogyny — its guilt about sex, its insistence on female subjection, its dread of female seduction — are all in St. Paul's epistles.<ref>Rogers, Katharine M. ''The Troublesome Helpmate: A History of Misogyny in Literature,'' 1966.</ref>}}

In K. K. Ruthven's ''Feminist Literary Studies: An Introduction'', Ruthven makes reference to Rogers' book and argues that the "legacy of Christian misogyny was consolidated by the so-called 'Fathers' of the Church, like [[Tertullian]], who thought a woman was not only 'the gateway of the devil' but also 'a temple built over a sewer'."<ref>{{Cite book | url = https://archive.org/details/feministliterary0000ruth_w8e4 | url-access = registration | page = [https://archive.org/details/feministliterary0000ruth_w8e4/page/83 83] | quote = christian misogyny. | title = Feminist literary studies: An introduction | publisher = Cambridge University Press | isbn = 978-0-521-39852-7 | last1 = Ruthven | first1 = K.

However, some other scholars have argued that Christianity does not include misogynistic principles, or at least that a proper interpretation of Christianity would not include misogynistic principles. David M. Scholer, a biblical scholar at [[Fuller Theological Seminary]], stated that the verse [[Galatians 3:28]] ("There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is neither male nor female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus") is "the fundamental Pauline theological basis for the inclusion of women and men as equal and mutual partners in all of the ministries of the church."<ref name=CBMW>{{cite web|title=Galatians 3:28 – prooftext or context?|url=http://cbmw.org/staff/|publisher=The council on biblical manhood and womanhood|accessdate= January 6, 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150206045217/http://cbmw.org/staff/|archive-date= February 6, 2015}}</ref><ref>Hove, Richard.

In ''Christian Men Who Hate Women'', clinical psychologist Margaret J. Rinck has written that Christian social culture often allows a misogynist "misuse of the biblical ideal of submission".

Dahlia Eissa, "[http://www.wluml.org/node/443#_ftn42 Constructing the Notion of Male Superiority over Women in Islam]: The influence of sex and gender stereotyping in the interpretation of the Qur'an and the implications for a modernist exegesis of rights", Occasional Paper 11 in ''Occasional Papers'' (Empowerment International, 1999).</ref>
The verse reads: "Men are the maintainers of women because Allah has made some of them to excel others and because they spend out of their property; the good women are therefore obedient, guarding the unseen as Allah has guarded; and (as to) those on whose part you fear desertion, admonish them, and leave them alone in the sleeping-places and beat them; then if they obey you, do not seek a way against them; surely Allah is High, Great."

In his book ''Popular Islam and Misogyny: A Case Study of Bangladesh'', Taj Hashmi discusses misogyny in relation to Muslim culture (and to [[Bangladesh]] in particular), writing:

{{quote|[T]hanks to the subjective interpretations of the Quran (almost exclusively by men), the preponderance of the misogynic mullahs and the regressive Shariah law in most "Muslim" countries, Islam is synonymously known as a promoter of misogyny in its worst form. Although there is no way of defending the so-called "great" traditions of Islam as libertarian and egalitarian with regard to women, we may draw a line between the Quranic texts and the corpus of avowedly misogynic writing and spoken words by the mullah having very little or no relevance to the Quran.<ref>Hashmi, Taj.

In his book ''[[No god but God: The Origins, Evolution, and Future of Islam|No god but God]]'', [[University of Southern California]] professor [[Reza Aslan]] wrote that "misogynistic interpretation" has been persistently attached to An-Nisa, 34 because commentary on the Quran "has been the exclusive domain of Muslim men".<ref name=issue>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/10/20/AR2006102001261.html|newspaper=Washington Post|title=Clothes Aren't the Issue|date=October 22, 2006|first=Asra Q.|last=Nomani}}</ref>

Scholars William M. Reynolds and Julie A.

In his book ''Scientology: A New Slant on Life'', [[L. Ron Hubbard]] wrote the following passage:
{{quote|A society in which women are taught anything but the management of a family, the care of men, and the creation of the [[future generation]] is a society which is on its way out.</blockquote>}}

In the same book, he also wrote:

{{quote|The historian can peg the point where a society begins its sharpest decline at the instant when women begin to take part, on an equal footing with men, in political and business affairs, since this means that the men are decadent and the women are no longer women. This is not a sermon on the role or position of women; it is a statement of bald and basic fact.</blockquote>}}

These passages, along with other ones of a similar nature from Hubbard, have been criticised by Alan Scherstuhl of ''[[The Village Voice]]'' as expressions of hatred towards women.<ref>{{cite news|title=The Church of Scientology does not want you to see L.

=== Aristotle ===
{{Main article|Aristotle's views on women}}
Aristotle believed women were inferior and described them as "deformed males".<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|edition = Spring 2016|title = Feminist History of Philosophy|url = http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2016/entries/feminism-femhist/|date = 2016-01-01|first1 = Charlotte|last1 = Witt|first2 = Lisa|last2 = Shapiro|editor-first = Edward N.|editor-last = Zalta}}</ref><ref name="Smith 467–478">{{Cite journal|title = Plato and Aristotle on the Nature of Women|url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/236725862|journal = Journal of the History of Philosophy|pages = 467–478|volume = 21|issue = 4|doi = 10.1353/hph.1983.0090|first = Nicholas D.|last = Smith|year = 1983|s2cid = 170449773}}</ref> In his work ''[[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]'', he states 

<blockquote>as regards the sexes, the male is by nature superior and the female inferior, the male ruler and the female subject 4 (1254b13-14).<ref name="Smith 467–478"/></blockquote>

Another example is ''Cynthia's catalog'' where Cynthia states "Aristotle says that the courage of a man lies in commanding, a woman's lies in obeying; that 'matter yearns for form, as the female for the male and the ugly for the beautiful'; that women have fewer teeth than men; that a female is an incomplete male or 'as it were, a deformity'.<ref name=":0" /> Aristotle believed that men and women naturally differed both physically and mentally. He claimed that women are "more mischievous, less simple, more impulsive ... more compassionate[,] ... more easily moved to tears[,] ... more jealous, more querulous, more apt to scold and to strike[,] ... more prone to despondency and less hopeful[,] ... more void of shame or self-respect, more false of speech, more deceptive, of more retentive memory [and] ... also more wakeful; more shrinking [and] more difficult to rouse to action" than men.<ref>History of Animals, 608b. 1–14</ref>

=== Jean-Jacques Rousseau ===
[[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] is well known for his views against equal rights for women for example in his treatise ''[[Emile, or On Education|Emile]]'', he writes: "Always justify the burdens you impose upon girls but impose them anyway... . They must be thwarted from an early age... . They must be exercised to constraint, so that it costs them nothing to stifle all their fantasies to submit them to the will of others." Other quotes consist of "closed up in their houses", "must receive the decisions of fathers and husbands like that of the church".<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Rousseau and Feminist Revision|journal = Eighteenth-Century Life|pages = 51–54|volume = 34|issue = 3|doi = 10.1215/00982601-2010-012|first = C.|last = Blum|year = 2010|s2cid = 145091289}}</ref>

=== Arthur Schopenhauer ===
[[Arthur Schopenhauer]] has been noted as a misogynist by many such as the philosopher, critic, and author Tom Grimwood.<ref name=":2">{{Cite journal|title = The Limits of Misogyny: Schopenhauer, "On Women"|url = http://philpapers.org/rec/GRITLO|journal = Kritike: An Online Journal of Philosophy|date = 2008-01-01|pages = 131–145|volume = 2|issue = 2|first = Tom|last = Grimwood|doi=10.3860/krit.v2i2.854|doi-access = free}}</ref> In a 2008 article published in the philosophical journal of ''Kritique,'' Grimwood argues that Schopenhauer's misogynistic works have largely escaped attention despite being more noticeable than those of other philosophers such as Nietzsche.<ref name=":2" /> For example, he noted Schopenhauer's works where the latter had argued women only have "meagre" reason comparable that of "the animal" "who lives in the present". Other works he noted consisted of Schopenhauer's argument that women's only role in nature is to further the species through childbirth and hence is equipped with the power to seduce and "capture" men.<ref name=":2" /> He goes on to state that women's cheerfulness is chaotic and disruptive which is why it is crucial to exercise obedience to those with rationality. For her to function beyond her rational subjugator is a threat against men as well as other women, he notes. Schopenhauer also thought women's cheerfulness is an expression of her lack of morality and incapability to understand abstract or objective meaning such as art.<ref name=":2" /> This is followed up by his quote "have never been able to produce a single, really great, genuine and original achievement in the fine arts, or bring to anywhere into the world a work of permanent value".<ref name=":2" /> Arthur Schopenhauer also blamed women for the fall of King Louis XIII and triggering the French Revolution, in which he was later quoted as saying:<ref name=":2" />

"At all events, a false position of the female sex, such as has its most acute symptom in our lady-business, is a fundamental defect of the state of society. Proceeding from the heart of this, it is bound to spread its noxious influence to all parts."<ref name=":2" />

Schopenhauer has also been accused of misogyny for his essay "On Women" (Über die Weiber), in which he expressed his opposition to what he called "Teutonico-Christian stupidity" on female affairs. He argued that women are "by nature meant to obey" as they are "childish, frivolous, and short sighted".<ref name="Clack1999" /> He claimed that no woman had ever produced great art or "any work of permanent value".<ref name="Clack1999" /> He also argued that women did not possess any real beauty:<ref>{{cite book|last1=Durant|first1=Will|title=The Story of Philosophy|date=1983|publisher=Simon and Schuster|location=New York, N.Y.|isbn=978-0-671-20159-3|page=[https://archive.org/details/storyofphilosophdura00dura/page/257 257]|url=https://archive.org/details/storyofphilosophdura00dura/page/257}}</ref>
{{quote|It is only a man whose intellect is clouded by his sexual impulse that could give the name of the ''fair sex'' to that under-sized, narrow-shouldered, broad-hipped, and short-legged race; for the whole beauty of the sex is bound up with this impulse.

== Violence ==

===Misogynist terrorism===
{{Main|Misogynist terrorism}}
[[Misogynist terrorism]] is an extreme form of misogynist violence. Certain mass murderers, often identifying as [[Incel|incels]], have explained their killings as anti-feminist acts, describing an attitude of entitlement to sex with attractive women, a desire to seek vengeance for the perception of being rejected, and a drive to put women "in their place."<ref name="Valenti2018">{{cite news |last=Valenti |first=Jessica |date=April 26, 2018 |title=When Misogynists Become Terrorists |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/26/opinion/when-misogynists-become-terrorists.html |work=The New York Times |access-date=July 22, 2020 }}</ref> (Misogyny is common among mass killers, even when it is not the primary motivation.)<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/10/us/mass-shootings-misogyny-dayton.html |title=A Common Trait Among Mass Killers: Hatred Toward Women |first1=Julie |last1=Bosman |first2=Kate |last2=Taylor |first3=Tim |last3=Arango |date=August 10, 2019 |work=The New York Times |access-date=July 23, 2020 }}</ref>

As is typical of terrorism, these acts are intended to cause widespread fear. Any woman may reasonably be unsettled about the potential of being targeted, notes Kate Manne, because often victims of these killings are treated as interchangeable. Women are targeted merely because they fit a certain type rather than because they have any particular relationship to the killer.<ref name="Manne2019" />{{rp|109}}

Since 2018 counter-terrorism professionals such as [[International Centre for Counter-Terrorism|ICCT]] and [[National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism|START]] describe this form of terrorism as a "rising threat" and include misogyny or male supremacy among the ideologies they track.<ref name="DiBranco2020">{{cite web |url=https://icct.nl/publication/male-supremacist-terrorism-as-a-rising-threat/ |title=Male Supremacist Terrorism as a Rising Threat |first=Alex |last=DiBranco |date=February 10, 2020 |website=International Centre for Counter-Terrorism |publisher=The Hague |access-date=July 23, 2020 }}</ref> Feminist [[Jessica Valenti]] was influential in recognizing these acts as misogynist terrorism.<ref name="Valenti2018" />

=== White supremacy ===
The [[Anti-Defamation League|ADL]] reports that "a deep-seated loathing of women acts as a connective tissue between many [[white supremacy|white supremacists]], especially those in the [[alt-right]], and their lesser-known brothers in hate like [[Incel|incels]], [[Men's rights movement|MRAs]], and [[Pickup artist|PUAs]]."<ref name=":4">{{Cite web|title=When Women are the Enemy: The Intersection of Misogyny and White Supremacy|url=https://www.adl.org/resources/reports/when-women-are-the-enemy-the-intersection-of-misogyny-and-white-supremacy|access-date=2020-10-21|website=Anti-Defamation League|language=en}}</ref>

Andrew Anglin uses the white supremacist website ''[[The Daily Stormer]]'' as a platform to promote misogynistic conspiracy theories, claiming that politically active “[w]hite women across the Western world” are pushing for liberal immigration policies “to ensure an endless supply of Black and Arab men to satisfy their depraved sexual desires.”<ref name="nbcnews">{{cite news|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/alt-right-fueled-toxic-masculinity-vice-versa-ncna989031|title=The 'alt-right' is fueled by toxic masculinity — and vice versa|author=Futrelle, David|publisher=[[NBC News]]|date=April 1, 2019|accessdate=November 5, 2020}}</ref> In July 2018, Anglin summarized his misogynistic views, writing: “Look, I hate women.

===Domestic violence===

The majority of [[Domestic violence]] and [[Intimate partner violence]] targets women and is committed by men. In particular, men with a rigid, narrow view of how to be a man are more likely to commit or tolerate this form of violence. The belief that men should be forceful and dominant in relationships and households makes a man more likely to hit, abuse, coerce, and sexually harass a woman. On the other hand, flexible and egalitarian ideas about manhood typically lead to less violence.<ref name=":3">{{cite web |url=https://theconversation.com/forceful-and-dominant-men-with-sexist-ideas-of-masculinity-are-more-likely-to-abuse-women-125873 |title=Forceful and dominant: men with sexist ideas of masculinity are more likely to abuse women |last=Flood |first=Michael |date=November 6, 2019 |website=The Conversation |publisher=Queensland University of Technology |access-date=July 23, 2020 }}</ref>

=== Coordinated attacks ===
[[File:Anita_Sarkeesian_headshot.jpg|thumb|right|[[Anita Sarkeesian]] was the target of a coordinated misogynistic attack because of her feminist work.]]
The most likely targets for misogynistic attacks by coordinated groups are women who are visible in the public sphere, women who speak out about the threats they receive, and women who are perceived to be associated with [[feminism]] or feminist gains. Authors of misogynistic messages are usually anonymous or otherwise difficult to identify. Their rhetoric involves misogynistic epithets and graphic or sexualized imagery. It centers on the women's physical appearance, and prescribes sexual violence as a corrective for the targeted women. Examples of famous women who spoke out about misogynistic attacks are [[Anita Sarkeesian]], [[Laurie Penny]], [[Caroline Criado Perez]], [[Stella Creasy]], and [[Lindy West]].<ref name=jane />

These attacks do not always remain online only. The government of [[Brazil]] makes misogynistic attacks against [[Patrícia Campos Mello]] and other female journalists in conjunction with street-level threats and violence.<ref>{{cite news |last=Mello |first=Patrícia Campos |date=August 4, 2020 |title=Brazil's Troll Army Moves Into the Streets |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/04/opinion/bolsonaro-office-of-hate-brazil.html |work=The New York Times |access-date=August 4, 2020 }}</ref> [[Swatting]] was used to bring Gamergate attacks into the physical world.<ref>{{cite news |last=Robertson |first=Adi |date=January 4, 2015 |title='About 20' police officers sent to Gamergate critic's former home after fake hostage threat |url=https://www.theverge.com/2015/1/4/7490539/fake-hostage-threat-sends-police-to-gamergate-critic-home |work=The Verge |access-date=August 4, 2020 }}</ref>

=== Language used ===

The insults and threats directed at different women tend to be very similar. [[Sady Doyle]] who has been the target of online threats noted the "overwhelmingly impersonal, repetitive, stereotyped quality" of the abuse, the fact that "all of us are being called the same things, in the same tone".<ref name=jane />

A 2016 study conducted by the [[Demos (UK think tank)|think tank Demos]] found that the majority of [[Twitter]] messages containing the words "whore" or "slut" were advertisements for pornography. Of those that are not, a majority used the terms in a non-aggressive way, such a discussion of [[slut-shaming]]. Of those that used the terms "whore" or "slut" in an aggressive, insulting way, about half were women and half were men. Twitter users most frequently targeted by women with aggressive insults were celebrities, such as [[Beyoncé Knowles]].<ref>[https://demosuk.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Misogyny-online.pdf The use of misogynistic terms on Twitter]</ref>

A 2020 study published in the journal New Media & Society also discusses how language on the internet can contribute to online misogyny. The authors specifically criticize [[Urban Dictionary]], claiming the language used in the definitions are misogynistic and anti-feminist, rather than simply being a collaborative dictionary.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ging|first=Debbie|last2=Lynn|first2=Theodore|last3=Rosati|first3=Pierangelo|date=2019-08-30|title=Neologising misogyny: Urban Dictionary’s folksonomies of sexual abuse|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1461444819870306|journal=New Media & Society|volume=22|issue=5|pages=838–856|doi=10.1177/1461444819870306|issn=1461-4448}}</ref>

== Feminist theory ==

==="Good" versus "bad" women===

Many feminists have written that the notions of "good" women and "bad" women are imposed upon women in order to control them. Women who are easy to control, or who advocate for their own oppression, may be told they are good. The categories of bad and good also cause fighting among women; [[Helen Lewis (journalist)|Helen Lewis]] identifies this "long tradition of regulating female behavior by defining women in opposition to one another" as the architecture of misogyny.<ref name=":6">{{cite magazine |last=Lewis |first=Helen |date=January 16, 2020 |title=Meghan, Kate, and the Architecture of Misogyny |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2020/01/meghan-markle-kate-middleton-royals-culture-war/604981/ |magazine=The Atlantic |access-date=July 14, 2020 }}</ref>

The ''[[Madonna–whore complex|Madonna–whore]] dichotomy'' or ''virgin/whore dichotomy'' is the perception of women as either good and chaste or as bad and promiscuous. Belief in this [[dichotomy]] leads to misogyny, according to the feminist perspective, because the dichotomy appears to justify policing women's behavior. Misogynists seek to punish "bad" women for their sexuality.<ref>{{cite journal |first1=Rotem |last1=Kahalon |first2=Orly |last2=Bareket |first3=Andrea C. |last3=Vial |first4=Nora |last4=Sassenhagen |first5=Julia C. |last5=Becker |first6=Nurit |last6=Shnabel |date=May 2, 2019 |title=The Madonna-Whore Dichotomy Is Associated With Patriarchy Endorsement: Evidence From Israel, the United States, and Germany |journal=Psychology of Women Quarterly |volume=43 |issue=3 |pages=348–367 |doi=10.1177/0361684319843298 |s2cid=155434624 }}</ref> Author [[Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie]] observes that when women describe being harassed or assaulted (as in the [[#MeToo movement]]) they are viewed as deserving sympathy only if they are "good" women — nonsexual, and perhaps helpless.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Marchese |first=David |date=July 9, 2018 |title=Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie: The novelist on being a "feminist icon," Philip Roth's humanist misogyny, and the sadness in Melania Trump. |url=https://www.vulture.com/2018/07/chimamanda-ngozi-adichie-in-conversation.html |magazine=Vulture |publisher=Vox Media |access-date=July 15, 2020 }}</ref>

In her 1974 book ''[[Woman Hating]]'', [[Andrea Dworkin]] uses traditional [[fairy tales]] to illustrate misogyny. Fairy tales designate certain women as "good", for example [[Sleeping Beauty]] and [[Snow White]], who are inert, passive characters. Dworkin observed that these characters "never think, act, initiate, confront, resist, challenge, feel, care, or question. Sometimes they are forced to do housework." In contrast, the "evil" women who populate fairy tales are queens, witches, and other women with power. Further, men in fairy tales are said to be good kings and good husbands irrespective of their actions. For Dworkin, this illustrates that under misogyny only powerless women are allowed to be seen as good. No similar judgement is applied to men.<ref>{{cite book |last=Dworkin |first=Andria |author-link=Andrea Dworkin |date=1974 |title=Woman Hating |url=https://www.feministes-radicales.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Andrea-DWORKIN-Woman-Hating-A-Radical-Look-at-Sexuality-1974.pdf |location=New York |publisher=Penguin Group |isbn=9780525474234}}

In her book ''[[Andrea Dworkin#Right-Wing Women|Right-Wing Women]]'', Dworkin adds that powerful women are tolerated by misogynists provided women use their power to reenforce the power of men and to oppose feminism. Dworkin gives [[Phyllis Schlafly]] and [[Anita Bryant]] as examples of powerful women tolerated by [[Antifeminism|antifeminists]] only because they advocated for their own oppression. Women may even be worshiped or called superior to men if they are sufficiently "good", meaning obedient or inert.<ref>{{cite book |last=Dworkin |first=Andria |author-link=Andrea Dworkin |date=1983 |title=Right-Wing Women |url=https://archive.org/details/rightwingwomen00dwor/ |location=New York |publisher=Perigee Books |isbn=9780399506710}}</ref>

Philosopher [[Kate Manne]] argues that the word "misogyny" as used by modern feminists [[Denotation|denotes]] not a generalized hatred of women, but instead the system of distinguishing good from bad women. Misogyny is like a police force, Manne writes, that rewards or punishes women based on these judgements.<ref name="Manne2019" />{{rp|79}}

===The patriarchal bargain===

In the late 20th century, [[second-wave feminism|second-wave feminist]] theorists argued that misogyny is both a cause and a result of [[Patriarchy|patriarchal]] [[social structure]]s.<ref>E.g., Kate Millet's ''Sexual Politics'', adapted from her doctoral dissertation is normally cited as the originator of this viewpoint; though Katharine M Rogers had also published similar ideas previously.</ref>

Economist [[Deniz Kandiyoti]] has written that [[colonialism|colonizers]] of the Middle East, Africa, and Asia kept conquered armies of men under control by offering them complete power over women. She calls this the "patriarchal bargain." Men who were interested in accepting the bargain were promoted to leadership by colonial powers, causing the colonized societies to become more misogynistic.<ref name=":7">{{cite magazine |last=Fisher |first=Max |date=April 25, 2012 |title=The Real Roots of Sexism in the Middle East (It's Not Islam, Race, or 'Hate') |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2012/04/the-real-roots-of-sexism-in-the-middle-east-its-not-islam-race-or-hate/256362/ |magazine=The Atlantic |access-date=July 14, 2020 }}</ref>

Sociologist [[Michael Flood]] has argued that "misandry lacks the systemic, trans-historic, institutionalized, and legislated antipathy of misogyny".<ref>{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=EUON2SYps-QC&q=michael+flood+misandry&pg=PA442 | title = International encyclopedia of men and masculinities | isbn = 978-0-415-33343-6 | last1 = Flood | first1 = Michael | date = 2007-07-18}}</ref>

===Contempt for the feminine===

[[Julia Serano]] defines misogyny as not only hatred of women per se, but the "tendency to dismiss and deride femaleness and femininity." In this view, misogyny also causes [[homophobia]] against gay men because gay men are stereotyped as feminine and weak; misogyny likewise causes anxiety among straight men that they will be seen as unmanly.<ref name=":8">{{cite magazine |last=Berlatsky |first=Noah |date=June 5, 2014 |title=Can Men Really Be Feminists? |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2014/06/men-can-be-feminists-too/372234/ |magazine=The Atlantic |access-date=July 14, 2020}}</ref> Serano's book ''[[Whipping Girl]]'' argues that most anti-trans sentiment directed at [[trans women]] should be understood as misogyny. By embracing femininity, the book argues, trans women cast doubt on the superiority of masculinity.<ref>{{cite book |last=Serano |first=Julia |author-link=Julia Serano |date=2007 |title=Whipping Girl |location=Berkeley |publisher=Seal Press |page=15 |isbn=978-1580051545}}</ref>

== British legal situation ==
In recent years, there has been increasing discussion in the UK of misogyny being added to the list of aggravating factors that are commonly referred to by the media as “[[hate crime]]s”. Aggravating factors in criminal sentencing currently include hostility to a victim due to characteristics such as sexuality, race or disability.<ref name=":9">{{cite web | url = https://www.sentencingcouncil.org.uk/explanatory-material/item/aggravating-and-mitigating-factors/ |title= Aggravating and mitigating factors | publisher= Sentencing Council}}</ref>

In 2016, Nottinghamshire Police began a pilot project to record misogynistic behaviour as either hate crime or hate incidents, depending on whether the action was a criminal offence.<ref>{{cite news|last = Brooks| first = Libby | url = https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/09/uk-police-chiefs-urged-to-adopt-harassment-of-women-as-hate |title= UK police chiefs urged to adopt harassment of women as hate crime | work = The Guardian |date=9 July 2018}}</ref> Over two years (April 2016-March 2018) there were 174 reports made, of which 73 were classified as crimes and 101 as incidents.<ref>{{cite news | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-nottinghamshire-44740362 |title= Misogyny hate crime in Nottinghamshire gives 'shocking' results | work = BBC News |date=9 July 2018}}</ref>

In September 2018, it was announced that the [[Law Commission (England and Wales)|Law Commission]] would conduct a review into whether misogynistic conduct, as well as hostility due to [[ageism]], [[misandry]] or towards groups such as [[goth subculture|goths]], should be treated as a hate crime.<ref>{{cite news | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-45423789|title= Misogyny could become hate crime as legal review is announced | work = BBC News |date=6 September 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last = Grierson| first = Jamie | url = https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/oct/16/review-of-uk-hate-law-to-consider-misogyny-and-ageism |title= Review of UK hate crime law to consider misogyny and ageism | work = The Guardian |date=16 October 2018}}</ref>

In October 2018, two senior police officers, [[Sara Thornton (police officer)|Sara Thornton]], chair of the National Police Chiefs' Council, and [[Cressida Dick]], Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, stated that police forces should focus on more serious crimes such as burglary and violent offences, and not on recording incidents which are not crimes.<ref>{{cite news|last = Tobin| first = Olivia | url = https://www.standard.co.uk/news/crime/met-police-chief-cressida-dick-backs-top-cop-sara-thornton-on-tackling-burglars-and-violence-not-a3978526.html |title= Met chief Cressida Dick backs senior police officer Sara Thornton on tackling burglars and violence ahead of hate crimes | work = Evening Standard |date=2 November 2018}}</ref> Thornton said that "treating misogyny as a hate crime is a concern for some well-organised campaigning organisations", but that police forces "do not have the resources to do everything".<ref>{{cite news | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-46053069|title= Focus on violent crime not misogyny, says police chief | work = BBC News |date=1 November 2018}}</ref>

In September 2020 the [[Law Commission (England and Wales)|Law Commission]] proposed that sex or gender be added to the list of protected characteristics.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.lawcom.gov.uk/reforms-to-hate-crime-laws-to-make-them-fairer-and-to-protect-women-for-the-first-time/|title=Reforms to hate crime laws to make them fairer, and to protect women for the first time|website=www.lawcom.gov.uk |date=23 September 2020}}</ref> At the time of the Law Commission's proposals seven police forces in England and Wales classed misogyny as a hate crime, but that definition had not been adopted across the board. The commission plans to make its official recommendations to the government in 2021.<ref>{{cite news|last = Scott| first = Jennifer | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-54254541|title= Misogyny: Women 'should be protected' under hate crime laws | work = BBC News |date=23 September 2020 |access-date=23 September 2020}}</ref>

== Criticism of the concept ==

[[Camille Paglia]], a self-described "dissident feminist" who has often been at odds with other academic feminists, argues that there are serious flaws in the [[Marxism]]-inspired<ref name=":10">"Marxist feminists reduced the historical cult of woman’s virginity to her property value, her worth on the male marriage market.", Paglia, 1991, ''Sexual Persona'', p. 27.</ref> interpretation of misogyny that is prevalent in [[second-wave feminism]]. In contrast, Paglia argues that a close reading of historical texts reveals that men do not ''hate'' women but ''fear'' them.<ref name=":11">Paglia, Camille (1991). ''[[Sexual Personae]]'', NY: Vintage, Chapter 1 and passim.</ref> Christian Groes-Green has argued that misogyny must be seen in relation to its opposite which he terms philogyny. Criticizing [[R. W. Connell]]'s theory of hegemonic masculinities, he shows how philogynous masculinities play out among youth in Maputo, Mozambique.<ref name=":12">{{Cite journal |last=Groes-Green |first=Christian |date=2011 |title=Philogynous Masculinities: Contextualizing Alternative Manhood in Mozambique |journal=Men and Masculinities |language=en |volume=15 |issue=2 |pages=91–111 |doi=10.1177/1097184x11427021|s2cid=145337308 }}</ref>
