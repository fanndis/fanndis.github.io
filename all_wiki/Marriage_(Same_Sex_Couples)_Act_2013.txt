The '''Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Act 2013''' (c. 30) is an Act of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] which introduced [[same-sex marriage in the United Kingdom|same-sex marriage in England and Wales]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/bills/cbill/2012-2013/0126/cbill_2012-20130126_en_1.htm|title=Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Bill|publisher=House of Commons|date=25 January 2013|accessdate=28 January 2013}}</ref>

== Background ==
[[File:Equal Marriage Wedding Cake.jpg|thumbnail|left|The Government's equal marriage promotion]]
[[Civil partnership]]s were [[Civil partnership in the United Kingdom|introduced in the United Kingdom]] in 2004, allowing same-sex couples and couples of whom one spouse had [[gender change|changed gender]] to live in legally-recognised intimate partnerships similar to marriage. It also compelled opposite-sex couples to end their marriage if one or both spouses underwent gender change surgery, or if the couple was not recognised in law as having male and female [[gender]].

Following the [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010 General Election]], in September 2011, [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]] [[Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State|Minister for Equalities]] [[Lynne Featherstone]] launched a consultation in March 2012 on how to introduce civil marriage for same sex couples in England and Wales.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lynnefeatherstone.org/2011/09/lynne-featherstone-mp-announces-government-consultation-on-equal-marriage.htm|title=Lynne Featherstone MP announces government consultation on equal marriage|publisher=lynnefeatherstone.org|date=21 September 2011|accessdate=28 January 2013}}</ref> The consultation closed in June 2012 and, in December 2012, the new [[Minister for Women and Equalities]], [[Maria Miller]], stated that the Government would be introducing legislation "within the lifetime of this Parliament" and that they were "working towards this happening within this Parliamentary Session".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/publications/about-us/consultations/equal-civil-marriage/consultation-response?view=Binary|title=Equal marriage: The Government's response|publisher=HM Government|accessdate=28 January 2013}}</ref> The Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Bill was introduced into Parliament on 24 January 2013. The leaders of the three main political parties in the United Kingdom gave their members a free vote in Parliament on the legislation, meaning they would not be whipped to vote for or against it.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2012/12/17/lib-dem-mp-gordon-birtwistle-gay-marriage-is-just-not-on/|title=Lib Dem MP Gordon Birtwistle: 'Gay marriage is just not on'|publisher=www.pinknews.co.uk|date=17 December 2010|accessdate=28 January 2013}}</ref>

The Bill was welcomed by many, including the gay rights campaigning group [[Stonewall (charity)|Stonewall]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stonewall.org.uk/what_we_do/parliamentary/5714.asp|title=Help Stonewall push for Marriage Equality|publisher=Stonewall (charity)}}</ref> The organisation Labour Humanists said there was "no credible ethical reason" to oppose gay marriage<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.labourhumanists.org.uk/backing-equal-marriage/|title=Backing equal marriage|publisher=Labour Humanists|date=28 May 2012|accessdate=28 January 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130330103340/http://www.labourhumanists.org.uk/backing-equal-marriage/|archive-date=30 March 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> and [[Minister for Women and Equalities]], [[Maria Miller]], told the House of Commons that the proposals "will strengthen, not weaken" the institution of marriage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.culture.gov.uk/news/ministers_speeches/9609.aspx|title=Parliamentary statement on equal civil marriage|first=Maria|last=Miller|publisher=Department for Culture, Media and Sport|date=11 December 2012|accessdate=28 January 2013}}</ref>

==== Report Stage ====

The Bill was examined by the House of Commons as a whole during the Report Stage on 20 and 21 May 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://services.parliament.uk/calendar/#!/calendar/Commons/MainChamber/2013/5/20/week.html|title=Parliamentary business for the week beginning Monday 20 May 2013|publisher=parliament.uk|date=9 May 2013|accessdate=9 May 2013}}</ref> During the Report Stage, a number of amendments were made to the Bill:

* A new clause was inserted which makes clear that chaplains who are employed by a non-religious organisation (such as in a hospital or a university) who refuse to conduct a same sex marriage will not contravene anti-discrimination legislation. 
* Clause 8 was amended to state that if the Governing Body of the Church in Wales makes clear that it wishes to conduct same sex marriages, the Lord Chancellor must make an order allowing it to do so, rather than simply having the power to do so.
* Following pressure on the government to open up access to civil partnerships for opposite-sex couples, a new clause was inserted which will require there to be a review of the operation and future of the Civil Partnership Act 2004 in England and Wales as soon as practicable.

==== Third Reading ====

The Bill received its Third Reading in the House of Commons on 21 May 2013, passing with a majority of 366 to 161.<ref name="3rd">{{cite news |title=Gay marriage: Commons passes Cameron's plan |publisher=BBC |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-22605011 |accessdate=21 May 2013 |date=21 May 2013 }}</ref>

The bill was therefore expected to be faced with a difficult hurdle, including strong, vocal opposition. A rarely used "wrecking" motion was tabled by [[Lord Dear]], to effectively reject the bill in full, in place of its second reading.

==== Committee Stage ====
The Bill underwent its Committee Stage in the House of Lords on 17, 19 and 24 June 2013.<ref name="timetable">{{cite news |title=Bill stages — Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Bill 2012-13 to 2013-14 |publisher=UK Parliament |url=http://services.parliament.uk/bills/2013-14/marriagesamesexcouplesbill/stages.html |accessdate=26 June 2013 |year=2013 }}</ref> A number of government amendments to the Bill were agreed during the Committee Stage:

* Clause 5 was amended to detail the relevant governing authorities for giving consent to same-sex marriages according to the rights and usages of the Jewish religion;
* Schedule 7 would now also amend the [[Marriage Act 1949]] to make clear that a same-sex marriage carried out by the Church of England, or by a religious organisation that had not opted in to solemnising same sex marriages would be void;
* Schedule 7 would now also amend the [[Public Order Act 1986]]. Part 3A of the 1986 Act prohibits stirring up hatred against people based on their sexual orientation. Part 3A would be amended to make clear that any discussion or criticism of marriage which concerns the sex of the parties to marriage shall not be taken of itself to be threatening or intended to stir up hatred.

==== Report Stage ====
The Bill underwent its Report Stage in the House of Lords on 8 and 10 July 2013.<ref name="timetable"/> A number of government amendments to the Bill were agreed during the Report Stage:
* Clause 2 was amended to define more specifically what is meant by the term "compelled";
* Schedule 5 was amended to provide for a new fast-track procedure for granting applications for gender recognition for those in protected marriages who transitioned over six years ago;
* A new clause was inserted which would allow the government to make secondary legislation permitting belief-based organisations (such as [[humanists]]) to solemnise marriages, following a public consultation.

==== Third Reading ====
The Bill had its Third Reading on 15 July 2013, and was passed by a simple [[voice vote]].<ref name="timetable"/>

The amended Bill returned to the House of Commons for approval of the amendments on 16 July 2013, which the House approved on the same day.

===Royal Assent===
The Queen granted [[Royal Assent]] to the Bill on 17 July 2013, thereby becoming the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Act 2013.<ref name="BBC23338279">{{cite news|work=BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-23338279|title=Same-sex marriage set to enter law later this week |date=16 July 2013|accessdate=16 July 2013 }}</ref>

=== 31 October 2013: Power to Make Subordinate Legislation ===
[[File:Save the Date.jpg|thumb|right|Date for introduction of same sex marriage in England and Wales]]
The Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Act 2013 (Commencement No. 1) Order 2013 brought into force various provisions of the Act on 31 October 2013:

* Section 4 and schedule 1 but only to the extent that these provisions conferred or related to the power to make subordinate legislation. Section 4 and schedule 1 allow religious organisations to perform same sex marriages if they opt in to do so. Subordinate legislation was required to provide details on the application procedure for religious buildings to register to conduct same-sex marriages;
* Paragraphs 5, 8 and 14 of schedule 4 but only to the extent that these provisions conferred or related to the power to make subordinate legislation. Paragraphs 5 and 8  amended the Domicile and Matrimonial Proceedings Act 1973 to set out the jurisdiction of courts in proceedings for orders relating to the ending of a marriage (divorce, judicial separation, nullity of marriage or because one of the couple is dead) and orders relating to declarations of validity of the marriage. Subordinate legislation was required to set out the jurisdiction of the courts to deal with divorce, judicial separation and nullity cases and about the recognition of such orders for a married same sex couple where one of the couple is or has been habitually resident in a [[Member State of the European Union]] (EU), or is an EU national, or is domiciled in a part of the UK or the Republic of Ireland. The subordinate legislation brought the jurisdiction in line with that contained within EU law which applies to opposite-sex couples. Paragraph 14 amended the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992 so that subordinate legislation could be made to provide a particular retirement benefit - the graduated retirement benefit - is available to surviving spouses in same-sex marriages in the same way it is available to widows, widowers and surviving civil partners;
* Section 14;
* Sections 17(1) to (3);
* Sections 18, 19 and 20;
* Paragraphs 1 and 2(2) of schedule 2. Paragraphs 1 and 2(2) allow for subordinate legislation to be made which provides that same-sex marriages conducted in England and Wales are to be recognised in Scotland (until same-sex marriage is permitted in Scotland) and Northern Ireland as civil partners; and
* Paragraphs 27(3) and (4) of schedule 4. Paragraphs 27(3) and (4) allow for subordinate legislation to be made which contains exceptions to the equivalence in law between opposite-sex marriages and same-sex marriages.

=== 13 March 2014: Same-Sex Marriage ===

The Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Act 2013 (Commencement No. 2 and Transitional Provision) Order 2014 brought into force the vast majority of the provisions which allowed same-sex couples to marry on 13 March 2014.

An exception was where the Registrar General has waived the notice period because one member of the couple was seriously ill and not expected to recover. Such marriages could take place at any time after 13 March 2014.<ref>https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/270230/140107_M_SSC__Act_factsheet_.pdf</ref> Same-sex couples who married abroad under foreign law and who were previously treated as civil partners were recognised as married as of 13 March 2014.<ref name="gov.uk">{{cite news|work=Government of the United Kingdom|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/first-same-sex-weddings-to-happen-from-29-march-2014|title=First Same Sex weddings to happen from 29 March 2014 (Department for Culture, Media and Sport) |date=10 December 2013|accessdate=14 December 2013 }}</ref><ref name="guardian20140626">{{cite news|work=The Guardian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/jun/26/civil-partnerships-convert-marriages-december-transgender-same-sex|title=Civil partnerships can be converted to marriages from December |date=26 June 2014|accessdate=8 July 2014 }}</ref> The provisions which came into force on 13 March 2014 were:
