A '''personal union''' is the combination of two or more [[State (polity)|states]] that have the same [[monarch]] while their boundaries, laws, and interests remain distinct.<ref name="oppenheim1">{{Cite book|last=Oppenheim|first=Lassa|author2=Roxbrough, Ronald|title=International Law: A Treatise|publisher=The Lawbook Exchange|year=2005|isbn=978-1-58477-609-3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vxJ1Jwmyw0EC&pg=PA154|accessdate=13 June 2013}}</ref> A [[real union]], by contrast, would involve the constituent states being to some extent interlinked, such as by sharing some limited governmental institutions. Unlike the personal union, in a [[federation]] and a [[unitary state]], a central (federal) government spanning all member states exists, with the degree of self-governance distinguishing the two. The ruler in a personal union does not need to be a hereditary monarch.<ref>In the Holy Roman Empire, many [[prince-bishop]]s had themselves elected to separate [[prince-bishopric]]s, which they ruled in a personal union. For example, [[Joseph Clemens von Bayern]] (1671–1723) was [[Prince-Bishop of Freising]] (1685–1694), [[Prince-Bishop of Regensburg]] (1685–1694), [[Prince-Elector of Cologne]] (1688–1723), [[Prince-Bishop of Liège]] (1694–1723) and [[Prince-Bishop of Hildesheim]] (1702–1723).</ref>

The term was coined by German jurist [[Johann Stephan Pütter]], introducing it into ''Elementa iuris publici germanici'' (Elements of German Public Law) of 1760.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qT7z4MZIB0wC&pg=PA8|title=Hanover and the British Empire, 1700-1837|last=Harding|first=Nick|date=2007|publisher=Boydell & Brewer|isbn=9781843833000|language=en}}</ref>

Personal unions can arise for several reasons, ranging from coincidence (a woman who is already married to a [[king]] becomes [[queen regnant]], and their child inherits the crown of both countries; the King of one country inherits the crown of another country) to virtual [[annexation]] (where a personal union sometimes was seen as a means of preventing uprisings). They can also be [[Codification (law)|codified]] (i.e., the constitutions of the states clearly express that they shall share the same person as head of state) or non-codified, in which case they can easily be broken (e.g., by the death of the monarch when the two states have different [[Order of succession|succession laws]]).

Because presidents of republics are ordinarily chosen from within the citizens of the state in question, the concept of personal union has almost never crossed over from monarchies into republics, with the rare exception of the president of France being a [[co-prince of Andorra]]. In 1860 [[Marthinus Wessel Pretorius]] was simultaneously elected as the president of [[South African Republic|Transvaal]] and [[Orange Free State]] and he tried to unify the two countries but his mission failed and led to the [[Transvaal Civil War]].

Note: The point at issue in the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] was the fear that the succession to the Spanish throne dictated by Spanish law, which would devolve on [[Louis, Dauphin of France (1661–1711)|Louis, ''le Grand Dauphin'']] &mdash; already heir to the throne of France &mdash; would create a personal union that would upset the European [[balance of power in international relations|balance of power]]; France had the most powerful military in Europe at the time, and Spain the largest empire.

== Goryeo ==
* Personal union with [[Shenyang]] in the [[Mongols|Mongol]]-led [[Yuan dynasty]] of China (1308–1313; [[Chungseon of Goryeo|King Chungseon]])
** As King of Goryeo (高麗國王) and King of Shenyang (瀋陽王) in 1308–1310
** As King of Goryeo and King of Shen (瀋王) in 1310–1313

King Chungseon reigned as King of Goryeo in 1298 and 1308–1313 and as King of Shenyang or King of Shen from 1307 (according to the ''[[History of Yuan]]'') or 1308 (according to ''[[Goryeosa]]'') to 1316. At that time, Goryeo had already become a vassal of Yuan dynasty and the Yuan imperial family and the Goryeo royal family had close relationship by marriages of convenience. Because he was a very powerful man during [[Külüg Khan|Emperor Wuzong]]'s reign, he could become the King of Shenyang where many Korean people lived in China. However, he lost his power in the Yuan imperial court after the death of the Emperor Wuzong. Because the Yuan dynasty made Chungseon abdicate the crown of the Goryeo in 1313, the personal union was ended. [[Chungsuk of Goryeo|King Chungsuk]], Chungseon's eldest son, became the new King of Goryeo. In 1316, the Yuan dynasty made Chungseon abdicate the crown of Shen in favour of [[Wang Go]], one of his nephews, resulting in him becoming the new King of Shen.
