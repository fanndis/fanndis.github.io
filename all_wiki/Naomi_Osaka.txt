{{Nihongo|'''Naomi Osaka'''|大坂 なおみ|Ōsaka Naomi{{noitalics|, {{IPA-ja|o̞ːsäkä näo̞mi}}}}|extra=born October 16, 1997}} is a Japanese professional [[tennis]] player. Osaka has been [[List of WTA number 1 ranked tennis players|ranked No. 1]] by the [[Women's Tennis Association]] (WTA), and is the first Asian player to hold the top ranking in singles. She is a three-time [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] singles champion, and is the reigning champion at the [[2020 US Open (tennis)|US Open]]. Her six WTA titles on the WTA Tour also include two at the Premier Mandatory level. At the [[2018 US Open (tennis)|2018 US Open]] and the [[2019 Australian Open]], Osaka won her first two Grand Slam singles titles in back-to-back Grand Slam tournaments, and is the first player to achieve this feat since [[Jennifer Capriati]] in 2001.

Born in Japan to a Haitian father and a Japanese mother, Osaka has lived and trained in the United States since she was three years old. She came to prominence at the age of sixteen when she defeated former US Open champion [[Samantha Stosur]] in her WTA Tour debut at the [[2014 Bank of the West Classic|2014 Stanford Classic]]. Two years later, she reached her first WTA final at the [[2016 Toray Pan Pacific Open|2016 Pan Pacific Open]] in Japan to enter the top 50 of the WTA rankings. Osaka made her breakthrough into the upper echelon of women's tennis in 2018 when she won her first WTA title at the [[2018 BNP Paribas Open|Indian Wells Open]]. Later in the year, she defeated 23-time Grand Slam singles champion [[Serena Williams]] in the [[2018 US Open – Women's Singles final|final]] of the [[2018 US Open (tennis)|US Open]] to become the first Japanese player to win a Grand Slam singles title. From 2018 through 2020, she has won a Grand Slam singles title in three consecutive years.

Osaka is one of the most marketable athletes in the world, building on her status as a Grand Slam singles champion, her multi-ethnic background, and her candid personality. She was the highest-earning female athlete of all time by annual income in 2020, and ranked 8th among all athletes in endorsement income. On the court, Osaka has an aggressive playing style with a powerful [[Serve (tennis)|serve]] that can reach {{Convert|200|km/h|mph|sigfig=3}}. She was included on [[Time (magazine)|''Time'']]'s annual list of the [[Time 100|100 most influential people in the world]] in both 2019 and 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Naomi Osaka: The 100 Most Influential People of 2019|url=https://time.com/collection/100-most-influential-people-2019/5567714/naomi-osaka/|access-date=2020-09-22|website=TIME|language=en-us}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Naomi Osaka: The 100 Most Influential People of 2020|url=https://time.com/collection/100-most-influential-people-2020/5888802/naomi-osaka-icon/|access-date=2020-09-23|website=Time}}</ref>

==Early life and background==
Naomi Osaka was born on October 16, 1997, in [[Chūō-ku, Osaka|Chūō-ku]], Osaka in Japan to Tamaki Osaka and Leonard François.<ref name="wta-profile">{{cite web |title=Naomi Osaka |url=http://www.wtatennis.com/players/player/319998/title/naomi-osaka-0 |website=WTA Tennis |accessdate=November 3, 2018}}</ref> Her mother is from [[Hokkaido]], Japan, and her father is from [[Jacmel]], Haiti. She has an older sister named [[Mari Osaka|Mari]] who is also a professional tennis player. The two girls were given their mother's maiden name in accordance with Japanese law that requires children with one foreign parent to take the last name of their Japanese parent in order to be included in their ''[[koseki]]'', or family registry. Osaka's parents met when her father was visiting Hokkaido while he was a college student in New York.<ref name="ny-times">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/23/magazine/naomi-osakas-breakthrough-game.html|title=Naomi Osaka's Breakthrough Game|last=Larmer|first=Brook|date=August 23, 2018|work=The New York Times|access-date=August 27, 2018}}</ref><ref name="washington-post">{{cite web |last1=Noori Farzan |first1=Antonia |title=Japanese, Haitian, and now a Grand Slam winner: Naomi Osaka's historic journey to the U.S. Open |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2018/09/10/japanese-haitian-and-now-a-grand-slam-winner-naomi-osakas-historic-journey-to-the-u-s-open/ |website=Washington Post |date=September 10, 2018 |accessdate=September 11, 2018}}</ref>

When Osaka was three years old, her family moved from Japan to [[Valley Stream, New York]] on [[Long Island]] to live with her father's parents. Osaka's father was inspired to teach his daughters how to play tennis by watching the [[Williams sisters]] compete at the [[1999 French Open]]. Having little experience as a tennis player himself, he sought to emulate how [[Richard Williams (tennis coach)|Richard Williams]] trained his daughters to become two of the best players in the world, despite having never played the sport. François remarked that, "The blueprint was already there. I just had to follow it," with regard to the detailed plan Richard had developed for his daughters. He began coaching Naomi and Mari once they settled in the United States.<ref name="ny-times"/> In 2006, Osaka's family moved to Florida when Naomi was eight or nine years old so that they would have better opportunities to train. Naomi practiced on the [[Pembroke Pines, Florida|Pembroke Pines]] public courts.<ref name="ny-times"/> When she was 15{{nbsp}}years old, she began working with Patrick Tauma at the ISP Academy.<ref name=tauma>{{cite web |title=Naomi Osaka Tennis Biography |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiorXvLYxpE |website=Patrick Tauma |accessdate=November 3, 2018}}</ref> In 2014, she moved to the [[Harold Solomon]] Tennis Academy.<ref name="solomon">{{cite web |title=Naomi Osaka: Japanese Firepower |url=http://www.tennisviewmag.com/tennis-view-magazine/article/naomi-osaka-japanese-firepower |first1 = Tom | last1 = Downs|website=Tennis View Magazine |accessdate=November 3, 2018}}</ref> She later trained at the ProWorld Tennis Academy.<ref name="wsj"/>

Although Osaka was raised in the United States, her parents decided that their daughters would represent Japan. They said, "We made the decision that Naomi would represent Japan at an early age. She was born in Osaka and was brought up in a household of Japanese and Haitian culture. Quite simply, Naomi and her sister Mari have always felt Japanese so that was our only rationale. It was never a financially motivated decision nor were we ever swayed either way by any national federation."<ref name=wsj>{{cite web |title=Naomi Osaka: The Tennis Star Who Was Overlooked by Everyone |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/naomi-osaka-the-tennis-star-who-was-overlooked-by-everyone-1536773788 |website=Wall Street Journal |accessdate=November 3, 2018 | first1 = Tom | last1 = Perrota}}</ref> This decision may have also been motivated by a lack of interest from the [[United States Tennis Association]] (USTA) when Naomi was still a young player.<ref name="ny-times"/> The USTA later offered Naomi the opportunity to train at their national training center in Boca Raton when she was 16 years old, but she declined.<ref name=wsj/>

==Professional career==

[[File:Osaka with Serena Williams.jpg|alt=A reporter holding a microphone to Osaka with Williams to the side smiling|thumb|240px|Osaka interviewed at the 2014 Stanford Classic alongside [[Serena Williams]]]]
Osaka never competed on the [[ITF Junior Circuit]], the premier international junior tour, and only played in a small number of junior tournaments at any age level.<ref name="core-tennis">{{cite web |title=Naomi Osaka Statistics |url=https://www.coretennis.net/tennis-player/naomi-osaka/13854/stats.html |website=Core Tennis |accessdate=October 30, 2018}}</ref> She instead skipped to the [[ITF Women's Circuit]] and played her first qualifying match in October 2011 on her 14th birthday.<ref name="japanese-interview-2016">{{cite web |last1=Uchida |first1=Akira |title=大坂なおみが18年間を振り返る「お姉ちゃんこそ最大のライバル」| trans-title=Naomi Osaka looks back over 18 years: 'My sister is my biggest rival' |language = Japanese|url=https://sportiva.shueisha.co.jp/clm/otherballgame/tennis/2016/10/05/18_split/index_4.php |website=Sportiva |accessdate=October 30, 2018}}</ref> She then made her professional main draw debut in doubles at her next tournament in March with her sister Mari. Meanwhile, she did not qualify for her first singles main draw until July in her seventh such attempt. Her best result of the 2012 season came at the ITF $10K event in [[Amelia Island]], where she lost to her sister in the semifinals.<ref name="itf-profile">{{cite web |title=Naomi Osaka |url=https://www.itftennis.com/procircuit/players/player/profile.aspx?playerid=100194114 |website=ITF Tennis |accessdate=October 30, 2018}}</ref> Osaka has never won a title at the ITF level, only managing to finish runner-up on four occasions.<ref name="itf-profile"/> Her first two finals came at the $25K level, one of which was in June 2013 in [[El Paso, Texas]]. The other was in March 2014 in Irapuato, Mexico and included a victory over her sister.<ref name="itf-profile"/>

In September 2013, Osaka turned professional shortly before turning 16 years old.<ref>{{cite news |title=Naomi Osaka: US Open champion's career in pictures |url=https://edition.cnn.com/2018/09/11/tennis/gallery/naomi-osaka-us-open-career-spt-intl/index.html |accessdate=October 9, 2018 |work=CNN |date=September 11, 2018}}</ref> She entered her first two qualifying draws on the WTA Tour that same month at the [[2013 Challenge Bell|Challenge Bell]] in Québec and the [[2013 Toray Pan Pacific Open|Pan Pacific Open]] in Tokyo. The latter event was her first opportunity to compete professionally in Japan.<ref name="itf-profile"/> The following summer, Osaka qualified for her first WTA main draw at the [[2014 Bank of the West Classic|2014 Stanford Classic]]. In her tour level debut, she upset world {{abbr|No.|number}} 19 [[Samantha Stosur]] in a tight match where she saved a match point in the second set tiebreak and came back from a 5–3 deficit in the third set.

Despite not winning another WTA main draw singles match in 2015, Osaka continued to climb up the rankings.<ref name=core-tennis/><ref name=wta-rankings/> She reached her two highest level ITF finals, the first at the $75K [[2015 Kangaroo Cup|Kangaroo Cup]] in Japan and the second at the $50K [[2015 Aegon Surbiton Trophy|Surbiton Trophy]] in the United Kingdom.<ref name=itf-profile/> Following these runner-up results, Osaka was ranked high enough to enter qualifying at the last two Grand Slam singles events of the year, [[2015 Wimbledon Championships|Wimbledon]] and the [[2015 US Open (tennis)|US Open]]. She won her first match at the US Open, but was unable to qualify for either main draw.<ref name=itf-profile/> Nonetheless, Osaka had a strong finish to the year. In October during the [[2015 WTA Finals|WTA Finals]], she won the Rising Stars Invitational four-player exhibition tournament, defeating heavy favorite and world No. 35 [[Caroline Garcia]] in the final.<ref name="rising-star">{{cite web |title=Osaka Wins WTA Rising Stars Invitational |url=http://www.wtatennis.com/content/osaka-wins-wta-rising-stars-invitational-0 |website=WTA Tennis |accessdate=October 30, 2018}}</ref> Continuing to play in November, Osaka then reached the biggest final of her career at the [[WTA 125K series|WTA 125K]] [[2015 Hua Hin Championships|Hua Hin Championships]] in Thailand. After a semifinal at a [[2015 Dunlop World Challenge|$75K event]] in Japan, she finished the year ranked No. 144.<ref name=wta-rankings/>

[[File:Naomi Osaka (33948760861) (cropped) 3.jpg|alt=Osaka ready to serve|thumb|upright=0.9|Osaka at the 2016 French Open]]
Osaka began the season playing three tournaments in Australia. Her results during this stretch were good enough to bring her near the top 100,<ref name=wta-rankings/> which allowed her to play in WTA Tour-level events all year.<ref name=core-tennis/> Most notably, she qualified for her first Grand Slam main draw at the [[2016 Australian Open – Women's Singles|Australian Open]] and made it to the third round. In particular, she upset No. 21 [[Elina Svitolina]] in straight sets in the second round before losing to No. 16 [[Victoria Azarenka]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.si.com/tennis/2016/01/23/australian-open-day-azarenka-wawrinka-raonic-muguruza|title=Australian Open Day 6: Keys beats Ivanovic after scare; Muguruza exits|last=Lisanti|first=Jamie|date=January 23, 2016 |work=Sports Illustrated| access-date=September 11, 2018}}</ref> Back in the United States, Osaka received a wild card into the [[2016 Miami Open|Miami Open]], her first Premier Mandatory main draw.

In the clay court events leading up the [[2016 French Open|French Open]], Osaka needed to qualify for every event she entered. She only managed to do so at a single event, the [[2016 Volvo Car Open|Charleston Open]], where she lost her only match in the main draw.<ref name=itf-profile/> Nonetheless, Osaka was ranked high enough to be directly accepted into the main draw of the French Open.

Osaka returned to tennis in the middle of July.<ref name=itf-profile/> At the [[2016 US Open (tennis)|US Open]] in August, she reached the third round at a Grand Slam event for the third time this year.

===2017: Slight regression, two top 10 victories===
After her huge improvement the previous year, Osaka was unable to set a new career high ranking in 2017. Nonetheless, she maintained a steady ranking throughout the season, rising no higher than No. 44 while falling no lower than No. 68, her year-end ranking.<ref name=wta-rankings/> She did not win more than two main draw matches at any event all year.<ref name=itf-profile/>

Osaka's best tournament result of the season came at the [[2017 Rogers Cup|Canadian Open]], where she reached the round of sixteen as a qualifier. During the event, she upset No. 16 [[Anastasija Sevastova]] before needing to retire against world No. 1 [[Karolína Plíšková]] due to an abdominal injury.

==National representation==
===Fed Cup===
Osaka made her [[Fed Cup]] debut for [[Japan Fed Cup team|Japan]] in 2017, while the team was competing in the [[2017 Fed Cup Asia/Oceania Zone|Asia/Oceania Zone Group I]]. Japan won all nine of their rubbers to advance out of their round robin pool. Although Osaka won her singles match in the [[2017 Fed Cup Asia/Oceania Zone Group I – Play-offs|play-off]] against [[Kazakhstan Fed Cup team|Kazakhstan]], the team lost their other two matches and was not able to advance.<ref>{{cite web |title=Kazakhstan seals World Group II play-offs berth |url=https://www.fedcup.com/en/news/253484.aspx |website=Fed Cup |accessdate=November 3, 2018}}</ref> The following year with Osaka absent, Japan was able to defeat Kazakhstan in the [[2018 Fed Cup Asia/Oceania Zone|same group]] to advance to the [[2018 Fed Cup World Group II Play-offs|2018 World Group II Play-offs]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Japan books place in World Group II play-offs |url=https://www.fedcup.com/en/news/280901.aspx |website=Fed Cup |accessdate=November 3, 2018}}</ref> In this stage, they hosted [[Great Britain Fed Cup team|Great Britain]] in a usual five rubber tie.

Japan won that final rubber to earn promotion to World Group II in 2019.<ref>{{cite web |title=Japan books its place among the world's elite for 2019 |url=https://www.fedcup.com/en/news/283697.aspx |website=Fed Cup |accessdate=November 3, 2018}}</ref>

===Hopman Cup===
Osaka made her [[Hopman Cup]] debut in [[2018 Hopman Cup|2018]] with [[Yūichi Sugita]]. Japan was making their first appearance at the exhibition tournament since [[2001 Hopman Cup|2001]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Hopman Cup Group B Preview: Japan vs Switzerland |url=https://www.vavel.com/en-us/tennis-usa/2017/12/29/862660-hopman-cup-group-b-preview-japan-vs-switzerland.html |website=Vavel |accessdate=November 3, 2018| first1 = Don | last1 = Han|date=December 29, 2017 }}</ref> They were grouped with Switzerland, the United States, and Russia, and lost all three of their ties.

Osaka credited improving her mental approach and cutting down on unforced errors for her breakthrough season in 2018. At the Wuhan Open towards the end of the year, she noted, "I think my biggest improvement is mental. My game is more consistent, there are not so many unforced errors.

==Personal life==
Osaka has a multi-ethnic background, with her father being born in Haiti and her mother being from Japan. She has said, "My dad's Haitian, so I grew up in a Haitian household in New York. I lived with my grandma. And my mom's Japanese and I grew up with the Japanese culture too, and if you're saying American, I guess because I lived in America, I also have that too."<ref name="washington-post"/> Her Haitian grandparents only spoke to her in [[Haitian Creole|Creole]] because they did not know English, while her mother conversed with her in Japanese.<ref name=ny-times/> Osaka decided to relinquish her US citizenship in 2019 so that she could represent Japan at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics and also in accordance with Japan's Nationality Act, which requires dual citizens to choose a nationality by the age of 22.<ref>{{cite web |title=Tennis star Naomi Osaka gives up her U.S. citizenship to play for Japan in Tokyo Olympics |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2019/10/10/tennis-star-naomi-osaka-gives-up-her-us-citizenship-play-japan-tokyo-olympics/ |website=The Washington Post |accessdate=November 24, 2019}}</ref> Osaka can understand Japanese, but is not very confident speaking the language.

Osaka's background is particularly unusual given that she represents Japan, a country that perceives itself as being very racially homogeneous.

This led to her parents relocating from Hokkaido to the city of Osaka, where she and her sister were born. As a result, her mother had no contact with her family for nearly 15{{nbsp}}years and Osaka did not get the chance to return to Japan until she was 11 years old, nor did her grandparents initially support her parents for building their daughters' lives around tennis.<ref name=ny-times/> However, they later began to support Osaka as a tennis player following her unexpected upset of Sam Stosur in her WTA Tour debut.<ref name=ny-times/> They were also proud of her in particular for winning the 2018 US Open.<ref>{{cite web |title=Naomi Osaka's grandfather in Hokkaido safe and proud |url=http://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/AJ201809100017.html |website=The Asahi Shimbun |accessdate=November 3, 2018| first1 = Masafumi | last1 = Kamimura}}</ref>
