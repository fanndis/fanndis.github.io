The '''13th President and Vice President election of the Republic of China''' ({{zh|t=中華民國第十三任總統、副總統選舉}}) was held on 14 January 2012.<ref>{{cite web |title=Central Election Commission:::Presidential Elections::: |url=https://web.cec.gov.tw/english/cms/pe |website=Central Election Commission |accessdate=9 January 2020 |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Presidential, legislative poll set tentatively for Jan. 14 |author=Angella Tsai and Lilian Wu |url=http://focustaiwan.tw/ShowNews/WebNews_Detail.aspx?Type=aIPL&ID=201104210021 |newspaper=Central News Agency |date=21 April 2011 |accessdate=27 April 2011}}</ref> The election was held concurrently with [[2012 Taiwanese legislative election|legislative elections]]. It was the fifth [[direct election]] for the [[President of the Republic of China]]. Prior to 1996, the President was elected by the [[National Assembly of the Republic of China|ROC's National Assembly]] and not directly by the people.

Incumbent [[Ma Ying-jeou]] was re-elected as [[President of the Republic of China|President]] with 51.6% of the vote. DPP challenger Tsai Ing-wen resigned her post as chairperson of the DPP following her election defeat.<ref>[http://focustaiwan.tw/ShowNews/WebNews_Detail.aspx?Type=aALL&ID=201201140030 "Tsai steps down as DPP chair after election defeat"] ''Focus Taiwan News Channel''. 2012.01.14</ref>

==Background==
The [[Kuomintang]] (KMT or Chinese Nationalist Party) ticket won a landslide victory in 2008 over the incumbent Democratic Progressive Party, with a 2.2 million vote margin on 58% of the valid votes.<ref>{{cite web|title=USCI Symposium on 2008 Taiwanese presidential election|url=http://china.usc.edu/ShowArticle.aspx?articleID=986|publisher=USC US-China Institute|accessdate=7 August 2011}}</ref>

The administration of [[Ma Ying-jeou]] has been friendlier in policy towards the People's Republic of China and also signed the [[Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement]] (ECFA), a preferential trade agreement between the governments of the PRC and the ROC.

The Democratic Progressive Party was hit hard with former president Chen Shui-bian's corruption revelations, but new chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen rebuilt the party, leading to a series of victories in legislative by-elections and local elections.
	
One big election topic appears to be the "[[1992 consensus]]", a term describing the declared outcome of a meeting in 1992 between the semi-official representatives of mainland China and Taiwan. The KMT agrees that this consensus should be the basis for negotiations with the PRC and supports it during the election,<ref>{{cite web|title=黃金十年|url=http://www.taiwanbravo.tw/p/blog-page_27.html|publisher=Kuomintang|accessdate=9 January 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120101140853/http://www.taiwanbravo.tw/p/blog-page_27.html|archivedate=1 January 2012}}</ref> while the DPP believes that no such consensus was reached<ref name="無92共識" /> and that as a policy it is equivalent to the [[One-China policy|One-China principle]], which the DPP opposes. Instead, the DPP has advocated that a "[[Taiwan consensus]]" be produced in a democratic way, by the legislature and a referendum of the people of Taiwan.<ref name="無92共識">{{cite news|title=蔡：無92共識 推台灣共識|url=http://www.libertytimes.com.tw/2011/new/aug/24/today-t1.htm|work=The Liberty Times|accessdate=9 January 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=【十年政綱】一、國家安全戰略|url=http://10.iing.tw/2011/08/blog-post_9219.html|publisher=Democratic Progressive Party|accessdate=9 January 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110926081048/http://10.iing.tw/2011/08/blog-post_9219.html|archivedate=26 September 2011}}</ref>

==Candidates==
As determined by a random draw, the DPP's Tsai-Su ticket was listed first on Election Day ballots; the incumbent KMT's Ma-Wu ticket was listed second; and the [[People First Party (Taiwan)|People First Party]] (PFP)'s Soong-Lin ticket, third.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://focustaiwan.tw/ShowNews/WebNews_Detail.aspx?Type=aALL&ID=201112090007 |title=Cna English News |publisher=Focustaiwan.tw |accessdate=14 January 2012}}</ref>

===Democratic Progressive Party===
{{main|2011 Democratic Progressive Party presidential primary}}
Incumbent chairperson [[Tsai Ing-wen]] was the DPP nominee. She was designated the party’s candidate in April 2011 following a primary by opinion polls. Candidates for the DPP primary were Tsai, former premier [[Su Tseng-chang]] and former chairman [[Hsu Hsin-liang]]. Former Vice President [[Annette Lu|Annette Lu Hsiu-lien]] announced her intention to run but withdrew. On 9 September 2012 candidate Tsai chose DPP secretary-general [[Su Jia-chyuan]] as her running mate.<ref>{{Citation | title = Su Jia-chyuan picked as DPP vice-presidential candidate | date = 9 September 2011 | url = http://focustaiwan.tw/ShowNews/WebNews_Detail.aspx?Type=aALL&ID=201109090011 | accessdate =9 September 2011}}</ref>

===People First Party===
PFP chairman [[James Soong|James Soong Chu-yu]] launched the party's first-ever Presidential bid on 20 September 2011. Soong had stated, however, that his candidacy is contingent on the success of a nationwide million signature drive. He has vowed to run and keep his candidacy active through the election if his campaign garners one million signatures throughout Taiwan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.asiaone.com/News/Latest%2BNews/Asia/Story/A1Story20110921-300649.html |title=James Soong announces Taiwan presidential bid |publisher=Asiaone.com |date=21 September 2011 |accessdate=14 January 2012}}</ref>

Soong chose [[National Taiwan University]] professor emeritus [[Lin Ruey-shiung]], a career scientist and academic with no political experience, to be his running mate.

Soong contended that the Taiwanese people desire a third choice outside the two main parties (KMT and DPP), despite concerns that his decision may split the Pan-Blue coalition vote to hand victory to the Pan-Green candidate as may have happened in the [[2000 Taiwanese presidential election|2000 Presidential election]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lowyinterpreter.org/post/2011/10/04/Deja-vu-in-Taiwan.aspx|title=Articles - The Interpreter|website=lowyinterpreter.org}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/China/MJ04Ad01.html |title=Asia Times Online :: China News, China Business News, Taiwan and Hong Kong News and Business |work=Asia Times|date=4 October 2011 |accessdate=14 January 2012}}</ref>

== Polls ==

After initially trailing, Ma started to pick up the lead, without Soong as a candidate, after September, 2011 in most opinion polls. However, Tsai benefited from the debates in the later stages.
