'''Google.org''', founded in October 2005, is the charitable arm of [[Google]], a multinational technology company.<ref name="founding">{{cite web|url=https://www.boston.com/business/technology/articles/2005/10/12/google_commits_1_billion_to_charity/
|title=Google commits $1 billion to charity: Firm makes good on IPO pledge
|publisher=Boston.com
|accessdate=2013-11-20}}</ref> The organization has committed roughly [[United States dollar|US$]]100 million in investments and grants to nonprofits annually.

The organization is noted for several significant grants to nonprofits using technology and data in innovative ways to support racial justice, educational opportunity, crisis response after health epidemics and natural disasters, and issues affecting the San Francisco Bay Area community where it is headquartered. It also hosts regular challenges around the world to stimulate innovative uses of technologies to address local challenges.

==Overview ==
The mission and approach of Google.org has seen multiple iterations over the years, an approach that mirrors other divisions within Google in its effort to reallocate resources towards the most significant and effective methods. The organization's general strategy involves funding the use of technology, data, and user-centered design to make a better world, faster.

Google.org is considered a part of Google, as opposed to an Alphabet organization, under the formation of the Alphabet parent company in 2016. To fund the organization, Google granted three million shares during their [[initial public offering]] (IPO).{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}} In 2014, the corporation stated on its website that it donates $100,000,000 in grants, 200,000 hours, and $1 billion in products each year.

== Major initiatives ==
As of 2016, Google has focused a majority of its efforts on a few key topics, based upon a premise of equality and opportunity.  
* '''Racial Justice.''' It is the first major corporate philanthropy organization to allocate funding to combat against racial inequality in the United States,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2016/02/26/google-org-awards-3-million-to-racial-justice-organizations-in-sf-bay-area/|title=Google.org Awards $3 Million To Racial Justice Organizations In SF Bay Area|last=Dickey|first=Megan Rose|website=TechCrunch|access-date=2016-09-27}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.govtech.com/budget-finance/Google-Tackles-Racial-Injustice.html|title=Google Tackles Racial Injustice|website=www.govtech.com|access-date=2016-09-27}}</ref> and as funded organizations such as Bryan Stevenson's Equal Justice Initiative, the ACLU, the Ella Baker Center, and Beyond12. In 2017, Google pledged $11 million in grants to several organizations in connection with racial bias.<ref>{{cite web|title=Google Just Dropped $11,000,000 to Make Sure #BlackLivesMatter|url=https://www.theroot.com/google-just-dropped-11-000-000-million-to-make-sure-b-1792711820|accessdate=22 September 2017}}</ref>
* '''Education and Digital Skills.''' In addition, Google.org funds education, economic development, and digital literacy related projects in a number of regions. 
* '''Disabilities.''' In previous years, Google has funded a number of other areas.  In 2015 they announced a $20M effort<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.google.org/impactchallenge/disabilities/|title=Announcing a more inclusive future for everyone|access-date=2016-09-27}}</ref> to use technology to improve opportunity and equality for people with disabilities, one of the few portfolios focused on this segment of the population.  Some noted as a unique lens to philanthropy, and a subject area that affects roughly 1 in 7 people across the world.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/05/29/google-challenge-disabilities_n_7469866.html|title=Google Commits $20 Million To Make The World More Accessible For People With Disabilities|last1=Editor|first1=Eleanor Goldberg|last2=Impact|first2=HuffPost|date=2015-05-29|website=The Huffington Post|access-date=2016-09-27}}</ref> The grantmaking initiative resulted in a diverse array of grants, including 3D printed prosthetics for landmine victims and children with limb differences, beacon-powered navigation tools for the visually impaired, data analytics projects to surface better tools and aids for people with cognitive disabilities, and better bracing and compliance systems for children with clubfoot. This portfolio ended in 2015.
* '''Crisis Response.''' Google.org has also responded to crises around the world, with giving initiatives addressing challenges with the [[European migrant crisis|European refugee crisis]] in 2016, the Ebola crisis in 2014, and the Nepal earthquake in 2015. In many instances, it has been one of the largest corporate donors. The organization also gave $250,000 to organizations working to serve residents affected by the Flint water crisis.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2016/05/03/google-org-announces-250000-in-grants-for-the-flint-michigan-water-crisis/|title=Google.org announces $250,000 in grants for the Flint, Michigan water crisis|last=Burns|first=Matt|website=TechCrunch|access-date=2016-09-27}}</ref> In August 2017, the company donated $250,000 to the Red Cross relief fund for Hurricane Harvey.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Yurieff|first1=Kaya|title=Businesses donate over $157 million to Harvey relief efforts|url=https://money.cnn.com/2017/08/30/news/companies/hurricane-harvey-corporate-donations/index.html|website=CNNMoney}}</ref>

Google.org and Google in general has also been supportive of a number of causes, including LGBTQ rights, veterans affairs, digital literacy, and refugee rights.

== Previous initiatives ==
Previous incarnations of Google.org took different approaches, usually focused on technology applied to social sphere, in keeping with the company's brand around technology and innovation.

Among its first projects was a mass-produced [[plug-in hybrid]] [[electric vehicle]] that can attain 100 [[miles per gallon|mpg]] (miles per [[gallon]]) (see [[vehicle-to-grid]]).<ref name="plugin">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/14/technology/14google.html|title=Philanthropy Google's Way: Not the Usual|last=Hafner|first=Katie|date=2006-09-14|work=New York Times|accessdate=2008-01-07}}</ref>

In November 2007, Google.org announced ''RE<C'' (Renewable Energy Cheaper Than Coal), a project that will invest several hundred million dollars in order to produce renewable energy at a profit from [[wind energy|wind]] and [[solar energy|solar]] sources, particularly [[solar thermal energy]]. ''RE<C'' has the ultimate goal of creating more than a [[gigawatt]] of power (enough to power a city the size of [[San Francisco]]) from renewable sources that would be cheaper than energy produced from [[coal]].<ref name="REC">{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/corporate/green/energy/|title=Powering a clean energy revolution|date=2007-11-27|accessdate=2008-03-31}}</ref>

The director from 2006 until 2009 was Dr. [[Larry Brilliant]].<ref name="director">{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/press/pressrel/brilliant.html|title=Google Names Larry Brilliant as Executive Director of Google.org|publisher=Google, Inc.|accessdate=2008-01-07}}</ref> Upon stepping down, Brilliant was replaced by [[Megan Smith]], Google's Vice-President of new business development, and the organization began focusing on creating engineering solutions to global problems with projects such as Google Flu Trends and Crisis Response, an effort to respond to natural disasters.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/24/technology/companies/24google.html?_r=1&ref=business|title=Google Chief for Charity Steps Down on Revamp|date=2009-02-24|work=Nytimes.com|accessdate=2012-12-12}}</ref> Megan Smith later left to join the office of the CTO under the Obama administration, at which point Google.org began focusing exclusively on its charitable giving initiatives under the stewardship of Jacquelline Fuller, who currently runs the organization.

In 2010, Google gave over $145 million to non-profits and academic institutions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2011/01/tech-for-good-catching-up-on-googleorg.html|title=Tech for good - catching up on Google.org|date=|publisher=Googleblog.blogspot.com|accessdate=2012-12-12}}</ref> In the same year, Google was named the Bay Area's top corporate philanthropist by the [[San Francisco Business Times]] for giving $27.6 million to Bay Area charities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/news/2011/07/22/google-is-top-bay-area-philanthropist.html|title=Google named Bay Area's top corporate philanthropist|date=2011-07-22|publisher=Bizjournals.com|author=San Francisco Business Times|accessdate=2012-12-12}}</ref> The company has won the same award for a number of years since, including as recently as 2016<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/news/2016/07/21/top-80-bay-area-corporate-philanthropists.html|title=The Top 80 Bay Area Corporate Philanthropists 2016 - San Francisco Business Times|access-date=2016-09-27}}</ref>  Charitable funds come from Google.org, the Google Foundation and the company itself.[[File:Prius RechargeIT 03 2008 at Google's campus.jpg|thumb|[[RechargeIT]] [[plug-in hybrid]]s converted [[Toyota Prius]] at [[Google]]'s [[Mountain View, California|Mountain View]] campus.]]

Pre-2012 Google.org projects included:

*Develop [[renewable energy]] cheaper than [[coal]] (RE<C): create utility-scale electricity from clean renewable energy sources that is cheaper than electricity produced from coal.  This project began in 2007 and was dropped in 2011.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2012/07/12/google-zero-carbon/ |title=Google's zero-carbon quest - Fortune Tech |publisher=Tech.fortune.cnn.com |accessdate=2013-06-15 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130526062530/http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2012/07/12/google-zero-carbon/ |archivedate=2013-05-26 }}</ref>  Though technical advancements resulted,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.google.org/rec.html |title=RE<C – |publisher=Google.org |accessdate=2013-06-15 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130629173557/http://www.google.org/rec.html |archivedate=2013-06-29 }}</ref> it did not meet its ambitious goal.
