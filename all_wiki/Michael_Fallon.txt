'''Sir Michael Cathel Fallon''' {{postnominals|country=GBR|KCB}} (born 14 May 1952) is a British politician who served as [[Secretary of State for Defence]] from 2014 to 2017. A member of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], Fallon served as the [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] (MP) for [[Sevenoaks (UK Parliament constituency)|Sevenoaks]] from 1997 to 2019, having previously served as the MP for [[Darlington (UK Parliament constituency)|Darlington]] from 1983 to 1992. 

Fallon served as Deputy [[Chairman of the Conservative Party]] from 2010 to 2012 and [[Department for Business, Innovation and Skills|Minister of State for Business and Enterprise]] from 2012 to 2014. He served as [[Minister of State at the Department of Energy and Climate Change]] from 2013 to 2014 and [[Minister for Portsmouth|Minister of State for Portsmouth]] in 2014, before serving as Defence Secretary under [[David Cameron]] and [[Theresa May]]. He resigned after being implicated in the [[2017 Westminster sexual misconduct allegations]].

==Early life and career==
Fallon was born in [[Perth, Scotland]]. His father was an Irish-born surgeon, Dr Martin Fallon, who was educated in Dublin and became a high-ranking medical officer in the British Army. Dr Fallon received the [[OBE|Officer of the Order of the British Empire]] for services to the wounded including at Arnhem.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/bridge-of-sighs-frank-mcnally-on-the-contrasting-role-of-two-dubliners-in-an-infamous-battle-of-the-second-world-war-1.4021341 |title=Bridge of Sighs – Frank McNally on the contrasting role of two Dubliners in an infamous battle of the second World War |work=The Irish Times |date=2019-09-17}}</ref> Michael Fallon was educated at [[Craigflower Preparatory School]] near [[Dunfermline]] and at [[Epsom College]], an [[Independent school (United Kingdom)|independent boys' school]] in [[Surrey]]. He then read [[Classics]] and [[Ancient History]] at the [[University of St Andrews]], graduating in 1974 with a [[Master of Arts (Scotland)|Master of Arts (MA Hons)]] degree, the equivalent of a BA at the oldest Scottish universities.

As a student, Fallon was active in the [[European Movement]] and the [[1975 United Kingdom European Communities membership referendum|"Yes" youth campaign in the 1975 referendum]]. After university he joined the [[Conservative Research Department]], working first for [[Peter Carington, 6th Baron Carrington|Lord Carrington]] in the [[House of Lords]] until 1977 and then as European Desk Officer until 1979. He became Research Assistant to [[Diana Elles, Baroness Elles|Baroness Elles]] in 1979, around the time that she became an [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]].

==Parliamentary career==
He was selected as the Conservative parliamentary candidate for [[Darlington (UK Parliament constituency)|Darlington]] in July 1982, and fought the [[1983 Darlington by-election|Darlington by-election]] on 24 March 1983, which was held after the Labour MP [[Edward Fletcher (politician)|Ted Fletcher]] had died. Although Fallon lost to Labour's [[Oswald O'Brien|Ossie O'Brien]] by 2,412 votes, he defeated O'Brien 77 days later by 3,438 votes in the [[1983 United Kingdom general election|1983 general election]]. He remained MP for Darlington until the [[1992 United Kingdom general election|1992 general election]], when he lost to Labour's [[Alan Milburn]] by a margin of 2,798 votes.

He re-entered [[Palace of Westminster|Parliament]] at the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997 general election]], holding the safe Conservative constituency of [[Sevenoaks (UK Parliament constituency)|Sevenoaks]] following the retirement of the sitting Tory MP, [[Mark Wolfson]].

Fallon was appointed as the [[Parliamentary Private Secretary]] to the [[Secretary of State for Energy]] [[Cecil Parkinson]] following the [[1987 United Kingdom general election|1987 general election]], and in 1988 joined the government of [[Margaret Thatcher]] as an Assistant Whip, becoming a [[HM Treasury#Whips|Lord Commissioner to the Treasury]] in 1990. Fallon, alongside [[Michael Portillo]] and [[Michael Forsyth, Baron Forsyth of Drumlean|Michael Forsyth]], visited Thatcher on the eve of her resignation in a last-ditch and ultimately unsuccessful attempt to persuade her to reconsider her decision.<ref>[http://margaretthatcher.org/speeches/displaydocument.asp?docid=109189 "Extract from Margaret Thatcher The Downing Street Years"], Margaret Thatcher Foundation, London 1993, Retrieved on 18 April 2016</ref>

===Junior Minister in the Department for Education and Science===
Thatcher appointed Fallon [[Parliamentary Under Secretary of State]] for the [[Department for Education and Skills (United Kingdom)|Department for Education and Science]] in July 1990, a position he continued to hold under the new [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|premiership]] of [[John Major]]. In this office Fallon headed legislation that led to the local management of schools,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2010-09-09b.571.0&s=speaker%3A10194#g571.2|title=Secondary Schooling|date=9 September 2010|work=They Work for You|access-date=18 April 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107112621/https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2010-09-09b.571.0&s=speaker:10194#g571.2|archive-date=7 November 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> which among other changes gave schools a greater degree of financial independence, including control of their own bank accounts and cheque books.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=1991-07-19a.641.4&s=michael+fallon+cheque+book#g648.3|title=Schools: 19 July 1991|date=19 July 1991|work=They Work for You|access-date=18 April 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107060242/https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=1991-07-19a.641.4&s=michael+fallon+cheque+book#g648.3|archive-date=7 November 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> He remained in that office until his 1992 general election defeat.

===Return to the House of Commons===
Following his return to Parliament in 1997, he was appointed Opposition Spokesman for [[Department of Trade and Industry (United Kingdom)|Trade and Industry]] and then [[Shadow]] [[Financial Secretary to the Treasury]], but he resigned from the frontbench owing to ill health in October 1998, and remained on the backbenches until his promotion as Deputy Chairman of the Party.

From 1999 he was a member of the [[Treasury Select Committee]], and chairman of its Sub-Committee (2001–10). He also served as a [[1922 Committee]] executive between 2005–07.

In September 2012, he was made [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Councillor]]<ref>{{cite news |last=Watt |first=Holly |date=5 September 2012 |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/9520858/Michael-Fallon-becomes-business-minister.html |title=Michael Fallon becomes business minister |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |access-date=26 October 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141027044319/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/9520858/Michael-Fallon-becomes-business-minister.html |archive-date=27 October 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref> upon his appointment as [[Minister (government)|Minister]] for [[Department for Business, Innovation and Skills|Business and Enterprise]].

Fallon has been a director at [[Tullett Prebon]], a leading brokerage firm in the City of London, and one of the biggest supporters of the [[privatisation]] of [[Royal Mail]].<ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2013-02-07a.411.8|title = Debate on Royal Mail Privatisation|access-date = 26 October 2014|website = TheyWorkForYou|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20141027005448/http://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2013-02-07a.411.8|archive-date = 27 October 2014|url-status = live}}</ref>

In January 2014, Fallon was appointed [[Minister for Portsmouth]],<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-hampshire-25753398|title=Minister for Portsmouth to be Michael Fallon|work=[[BBC News]]|access-date=26 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141002214710/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-hampshire-25753398|archive-date=2 October 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> subsequently being promoted to the Cabinet, on 15 July 2014, as Secretary of State for Defence.

In December 2016, Fallon admitted that UK-supplied internationally banned [[cluster munition]]s had been used in [[Saudi Arabia]]'s bombing campaign in [[Yemen]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Cowburn |first=Ashley |date=19 December 2016 |title=British manufactured cluster bombs have been used in Yemen by Saudi Arabia, Michael Fallon admits |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/michael-fallon-confirms-british-made-cluster-bombs-have-been-used-by-saudis-in-yemen-conflict-a7485106.html |newspaper=The Independent |access-date=9 November 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171110063135/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/michael-fallon-confirms-british-made-cluster-bombs-have-been-used-by-saudis-in-yemen-conflict-a7485106.html |archive-date=10 November 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>

In April 2017, Fallon confirmed that the UK would use [[Nuclear weapons and the United Kingdom|its nuclear weapons]] in a "[[Pre-emptive nuclear strike|pre-emptive initial strike]]" in "the most extreme circumstances" on BBC Radio's ''[[Today (BBC Radio 4)|Today]]'' programme.<ref>{{cite news |last=Merrick |first=Rob |date=24 April 2017 |title=Theresa May would fire UK's nuclear weapons as a 'first strike', says Defence Secretary Michael Fallon |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/theresa-may-nuclear-weapons-first-strike-michael-fallon-general-election-jeremy-corbyn-trident-a7698621.html |newspaper=The Independent |access-date=24 April 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170425031826/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/theresa-may-nuclear-weapons-first-strike-michael-fallon-general-election-jeremy-corbyn-trident-a7698621.html |archive-date=25 April 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>

In 2017, Fallon warned that [[Russia]]'s [[Zapad 2017 exercise]] in [[Belarus]] and Russia's [[Kaliningrad Oblast]] was "designed to provoke us". Fallon falsely claimed that number of Russian troops taking part in exercise could reach 100,000.<ref>{{cite news |title=Russia was the target of Nato's own fake news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/russia-zapad-2017-putin-west-fake-news-us-world-war-three-ukraine-belarus-nato-a7961856.html |work=The Independent |date=22 September 2017 |access-date=9 September 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190930234354/https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/russia-zapad-2017-putin-west-fake-news-us-world-war-three-ukraine-belarus-nato-a7961856.html |archive-date=30 September 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>

====European Union====
In an interview in ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' in 2016, before the [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|European Union (EU) membership referendum]], Fallon described himself as [[Euroscepticism|Eurosceptic]] and critical of many aspects of the [[European Union|EU]], but said that he wanted Britain to remain in the EU, in the face of multiple threats from Russia's president [[Vladimir Putin]], crime, and international terrorism.<ref>{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=20 February 2016 |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/eureferendum/12166767/Strength-in-numbers-Michael-Fallon-backs-staying-with-Europe.html |title=Strength in numbers: Michael Fallon backs staying with Europe |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |access-date=1 November 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107074216/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/eureferendum/12166767/Strength-in-numbers-Michael-Fallon-backs-staying-with-Europe.html |archive-date=7 November 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>

====Run-up to the 2015 general election====
During the run-up to the [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015 general election]], Fallon wrote an article in ''[[The Times]]'' saying that [[Ed Miliband]] had stabbed his brother [[David Miliband]] in the back to [[2010 Labour Party leadership election (UK)|become Labour leader]] and he would also stab Britain in the back to become prime minister. Fallon subsequently declined the opportunity to describe Miliband as a decent person and his comments embarrassed some Conservative supporters. Miliband gave a response, saying that Fallon had fallen below his usual standards and demeaned himself, which the ''[[New Statesman]]'' asserted was dignified, contrasting with Fallon's counter-productive personal attack.<ref>{{cite news |last=Eaton |first=George |date=9 April 2015 |title=Michael Fallon's attack backfires, leaving Miliband to emerge as the decent man |url=https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2015/04/fallons-attack-backfires-miliband-emerges-decent-man |newspaper=[[New Statesman]] |author-link=George Eaton (journalist) |access-date=20 April 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150412020804/http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2015/04/fallons-attack-backfires-miliband-emerges-decent-man |archive-date=12 April 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref>

====Expenses scandal====
According to ''The Daily Telegraph'' Fallon, Deputy Chairman of the Treasury Select Committee, claimed for mortgage repayments on his Westminster flat in their entirety. MPs are only allowed to claim for interest charges.<ref name="expenses">{{cite news |last=Swaine |first=Jon |date=21 May 2009 |title=MPs' expenses: Michael Fallon claimed £8,300 too much in mortgage expenses |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/mps-expenses/5358001/MPs-expenses-Michael-Fallon-claimed-8300-too-much-in-mortgage-expenses.html |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |access-date=26 October 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141027022509/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/mps-expenses/5358001/MPs-expenses-Michael-Fallon-claimed-8300-too-much-in-mortgage-expenses.html |archive-date=27 October 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Between 2002 and 2004, Fallon regularly claimed £1,255 per month in capital repayments and interest, rather than the £700–£800 for the interest component alone.<ref name="expenses" /> After his error was noticed by staff at the Commons Fees Office in September 2004, he asked: "Why has no one brought this to my attention before?" <ref name="expenses" /> He repaid £2,200 of this over-claim, but was allowed to offset the remaining £6,100 against his allowance. After realising they had failed to notice the excessive claims, Commons staff reportedly suggested Fallon submit fresh claims which would "reassign" the surplus payments to other costs he had legitimately incurred.<ref name="expenses" />

====Allegations of sexual harassment, inappropriate behaviour and resignation====
In late October 2017 it was reported that Fallon had repeatedly and inappropriately touched journalist [[Julia Hartley-Brewer]]'s knee during a dinner in 2002.<ref>{{cite news|last=Rayner|first=Gordon|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/10/31/defence-secretary-sir-michael-fallon-admits-touching-female/|title=Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon admits touching female radio presenter's knee at a dinner|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=31 October 2017|access-date=1 November 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171102085206/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/10/31/defence-secretary-sir-michael-fallon-admits-touching-female/|archive-date=2 November 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> Hartley-Brewer recalled that after Fallon kept putting his hand on her knee, she "calmly and politely explained to him, that if he did it again, I would punch him in the face".<ref>{{cite news |title=Michael Fallon 'apologised for touching journalist's knee' |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-41812281 |work=BBC News |date=31 October 2017}}</ref> Fallon resigned two days later believing his "previous conduct" towards women had "fallen below" what is acceptable.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-41838682|title=Fallon resigns as Defence Secretary over behaviour claims|work=BBC News|date=1 November 2017|access-date=1 November 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171101193505/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-41838682|archive-date=1 November 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> Hartley-Brewer expressed shock at the resignation, saying: "I didn't feel it was something that needed any further dealing with".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/insane-absurd-and-ridiculous-journalist-julia-hartleybrewer-touched-on-knee-by-michael-fallon-a3674196.html|title=Journalist touched on knee by Fallon calls resignation 'insane'|work=Evening Standard|access-date=2018-04-22|language=en-GB|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180423040620/https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/insane-absurd-and-ridiculous-journalist-julia-hartleybrewer-touched-on-knee-by-michael-fallon-a3674196.html|archive-date=23 April 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

It was subsequently reported Fallon had been forced to resign in part due to an allegation of inappropriate and lewd comments towards fellow Conservative MP [[Andrea Leadsom]] when they both sat on the Treasury Select Committee.
