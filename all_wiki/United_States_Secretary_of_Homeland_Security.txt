The '''United States secretary of homeland security''' is the head of the [[United States Department of Homeland Security]], the [[United States federal executive departments|federal department]] tasked with ensuring [[public safety]] in the [[United States]]. The secretary is a member of the [[Cabinet of the United States]]. The position was created by the [[Homeland Security Act]] following the [[September 11 attacks|attacks of September 11, 2001]]. 

The new department consisted primarily of components transferred from other Cabinet departments because of their role in homeland security, such as the [[United States Coast Guard|Coast Guard]], the [[Federal Protective Service (United States)|Federal Protective Service]], [[U.S. Customs and Border Protection]] (which includes the [[United States Border Patrol]]), [[U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement]] (which includes Homeland Security Investigations), the [[United States Secret Service]] and the [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]]. It does not, however, include the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] or the [[Central Intelligence Agency]].<ref>[[Homeland Security Act]], {{USPL|107|296}}</ref>

The current acting secretary of homeland security is [[Chad Wolf]], who began in that role on November 13, 2019.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/chad-wolf-sworn-in-as-acting-department-of-homeland-security-chief-fifth-under-trump/2019/11/13/6633a614-0637-11ea-8292-c46ee8cb3dce_story.html|title=Chad Wolf sworn in as acting Department of Homeland Security chief, fifth under Trump|last=Miroff|first=Nick|date=November 13, 2019|website=The Washington Post|url-status=live|access-date=November 13, 2019}}</ref>

==Inclusion in the presidential line of succession==
Traditionally, the order of the [[United States presidential line of succession|presidential line of succession]] is determined (after the [[Vice President of the United States|vice president]], [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|speaker of the House]], and [[President pro tempore of the United States Senate|president pro tempore of the Senate]]) by the order of the creation of the cabinet positions, and the list as mandated under {{usc|3|19}} follows this tradition.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

On March 7, 2006, 43rd president [[George W. Bush]] signed {{USBill|109|HR|3199}} as {{USPL|109|177}}, which renewed the [[USA Patriot Act|Patriot Act]] of 2001 and amended the [[Presidential Succession Act]] of 1947 to include the newly created presidential Cabinet position of Secretary of Homeland Security in the line of succession after the previously authorized [[Secretary of Veterans Affairs|secretary of veterans affairs]] (§ 503) (which are listed and designated in the order that their departments were created). In the [[109th United States Congress|109th Congress]], legislation was introduced to place the secretary of homeland security into the line of succession after the attorney general but that bill expired at the end of the 109th Congress and was not re-introduced.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

==List of secretaries of homeland security==
Prior to the establishment of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, there existed an assistant to the president for the Office of Homeland Security, which was created following the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001.

[[George W. Bush]] nominated [[Bernard Kerik]] for the position in 2004.

During a July 16, 2013, interview, President Obama referred generally to the "bunch of strong candidates" for nomination to head the [[Department of Homeland Security]], but singled out Kelly as "one of the best there is" and "very well qualified for the job".<ref>[http://www.politico.com/politico44/2013/07/obama-would-consider-ray-kelly-to-replace-janet-napolitano-168507.html "Obama would consider Ray Kelly to replace Janet Napolitano"], by Jennifer Epstein, ''Politico'', July 16, 2013, retrieved July 17, 2013.</ref>

Later in July 2013, the online internet news website/magazine ''[[Huffington Post]]'' detailed "a growing campaign to quash the potential nomination of New York City Police commissioner Raymond Kelly as the next secretary of the Department of Homeland Security" amid claims of "divisive, harmful, and ineffective policing that promotes stereotypes and profiling".<ref>[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/08/01/muslims-oppose-raymond-kelly-homeland-security_n_3691876.html "Muslims Oppose Raymond Kelly Bid For Homeland Security Secretary"], by Omar Sacirbey, ''Huffington Post'', August 1, 2013, retrieved August 4, 2013.</ref> Days after that article, Kelly penned a statistics-heavy ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' [[opinion article]] defending the NYPD's programs, stating "the average number of stops we conduct is less than one per officer per week" and that this and other practices have led to "7,383 lives saved—and... they are largely the lives of young men of color."<ref>[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324448104578616333588719320 "Ray Kelly: The NYPD: Guilty of Saving 7,383 Lives"], by Ray Kelly, ''Opinion: The Wall Street Journal'', July 22, 2013, retrieved August 4, 2013.</ref>

Kelly was also featured because of his NYPD retirement and unusually long tenure there in a long segment on the [[CBS News]] program ''[[CBS News Sunday Morning|Sunday Morning]]'' in December 2013, especially raising the question of the controversial "stop and frisk" policy in [[New York City]] and the long decline and drop of various types of crimes committed.
