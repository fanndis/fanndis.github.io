'''Generation name''' (variously '''zibei''' or '''banci''' in Chinese; '''tự bối''', '''ban thứ''' or '''tên thế hệ''' in Vietnamese; '''hangnyeolja''' in Korea) is one of the characters in a traditional [[Chinese given name|Chinese]], [[Vietnamese name|Vietnamese]] and [[Korean name|Korean]] given name, and is so called because each member of a generation (i.e. [[sibling]]s and paternal [[cousin]]s of the same generation) share that character.

Where used, generation names were usually given only to males,{{cn|date=September 2018}} although this varies from [[lineage (anthropology)|lineage]] to lineage and has changed over time.

== Generation poem ==
The sequence of generation names is typically prescribed and kept in record by a '''generation poem''' ({{lang-zh|t=班次聯}} {{transliteration |zh|pinyin|bāncì lián}} or {{lang-zh|t=派字歌}} {{Transliteration |zh|pinyin|pàizì gē}}) specific to each lineage. While it may have a [[Mnemonic device|mnemonic function]], these poems can vary in length from around a dozen characters to hundreds of characters. Each successive character becomes the generation name for successive generations.<ref>{{cite book | last = Michener | first = James A. | authorlink = James A.

Generation poems were usually composed by a committee of family elders whenever a new lineage was established through geographical emigration or social elevation. Thus families sharing a common generation poem are considered to also share a common ancestor and have originated from a common geographical location.

Important examples are the generation poems of the descendants of the [[Four Sages]] ([[Confucius]], [[Mencius]], [[Yan Hui]], [[Zengzi]]): the [[Kong (surname)|Kong]], [[Meng (surname) |Meng]], [[Yan (surname) |Yan]], and [[Zeng]] families (the Four Families, [[w:zh:四氏|四氏]]). During the [[Ming dynasty]],  [[Jianwen Emperor|Emperor Jianwen]] respected [[Confucius]] and [[Mencius]] so much that he honored their families with generation poems. These generation poems were extended with the permission of the [[Chongzhen Emperor]] of the Ming dynasty, the [[Tongzhi Emperor]] of the [[Qing dynasty]], and the Ministry of Interior of the [[Beiyang government]].<ref>{{in lang|zh}} [http://www.ndcnc.gov.cn/datalib/2004/HundredName/DL/DL-20031203183333/ 孔姓 (The Kong family, descendants of Confucius)] {{webarchive |url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110903010033/http://www.ndcnc.gov.cn/datalib/2004/HundredName/DL/DL-20031203183333/ |date= September 3, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{in lang|zh}} [http://www.ndcnc.gov.cn/datalib/2004/HundredName/DL/DL-20040216142301 孟姓 (The Meng family, descendants of Mencius)] {{webarchive |url= https://web.archive.org/web/20060116060231/http://www.ndcnc.gov.cn/datalib/2004/HundredName/DL/DL-20040216142301 |date= January 16, 2006}}</ref>

The generation poem used by the [[Song dynasty]] [[House of Zhao]] was "若夫，元德允克、令德宜崇、師古希孟、時順光宗、良友彥士、登汝必公、不惟世子、與善之從、伯仲叔季、承嗣由同。"<ref>http://blog.sina.com.cn/zjf895</ref><ref name="梁永樂、趙公梃2014">{{cite book |author=梁永樂、趙公梃|title=八爪魚家長──孩子愛玩不是罪 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=5Y9gBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA107 |date=1 July 2014 |publisher=明窗 |isbn= 978-988-8287-38-3 |pages= 107–}}</ref><ref name= "Chaffee1999">{{cite book | last = Chaffee | first = John W |author-link = John W.

Another notable generation poem is the [[Nguyễn dynasty]]'s ''[[:s:vi:Đế hệ thi|Đế hệ thi]]'' (帝係詩 'Poem of the Generations of the Imperial Family'), created by Emperor [[Minh Mạng]].

== Practice ==
Generation names may be the first or second character in a given name, and normally this position is kept consistent for the associated lineage. However some lineages alternate its position from generation to generation. This is quite common for [[Korean name|Korean names]]. Sometimes lineages will also share the same [[radical (Chinese)|radical]] in the non-generation name.

A related custom is the practice of naming two children from the characters of a common word. In Chinese, most words are composed of two or more characters. For example, by taking apart the word ''jiàn-kāng'' {{Zh|c=|s=|t={{linktext|健康}}|labels=no}} ('healthy'), the Wang family might name one son Wáng Jiàn (王健) and the other Wáng Kāng (王康). Another example would be ''měi-lì'' {{Zh|c=|s=|t={{linktext|美丽}}|labels=no}} ('beautiful'). Daughters of the Zhous might be named Zhōu Měi (周美) and Zhōu Lì (周丽).

Besides the [[Han Chinese|Han]] majority, the Muslim [[Hui people|Hui Chinese people]]{{#tag:ref|Some authors consider the Hui people to be a Han Chinese subgroup.|group="N.B."}} has also widely employed generation names, which they call ''lunzi paibie''; <!-- ? ?派別--> for instance, in the [[Nasr al-Din (Yunnan)|Na family]], the five most recent generations used the characters Wan, Yu, Zhang, Dian, and Hong.  This practice is slowly fading since the government began keeping public records of genealogy.<ref>{{cite book |url= https://archive.org/details/chinaoffcenterma0000unse |url-access= registration |quote= ma surname hui. |title=China off center: mapping the margins of the middle kingdom |authors=Susan Debra Blum, Lionel M.

== Affiliation character ==
In place of a biological generation, the character could be used as an indicator of seniority and peer groups in  religious lineages. Thus, in the lay [[Chinese Buddhism |Buddhist]] circles of Song and Yuan times, it could be Dào ([[wikt:道|道]] '[[Dharma#Buddhism |dharma]]'), Zhì ([[wikt:智|智]] '[[Prajñā (Buddhism)|prajñā]], wisdom'), Yuán ([[wikt:圓|圓]] 'complete, all-embracing'<ref name= Soothill>[[William Edward Soothill]] & [[Lewis Hodous]], 1937, [http://mahajana.net/texts/kopia_lokalna/soothill-hodous.html ''A Dictionary of Chinese Buddhist Terms''].</ref>{{#tag:ref|圓 corresponds to ''pūrṇa'' ('teeming, filled') in Sanskrit, as in the [[Sutra of Perfect Enlightenment|Complete Enlightenment]] (Pūrṇabuddha 圓覺).|group="N.B."}}), Pǔ ([[wikt:普|普]] 'universal'{{#tag:ref|普 is the equivalent of ''viśva'' in Sanskrit.<ref name=Soothill/>|group="N.B."}}), Jué ([[wikt:覺|覺]] '[[bodhi]], enlightenment'), Shàn ([[wikt:善|善]] 'skillful, virtuous'<ref name=Muller>[[A. Charles Muller]], ''Digital Dictionary of Buddhism''.</ref>). The characters demonstrated belonging to a devotionalist group with a social status close to the family one. The affiliation character Miào ([[wikt:妙|妙]] 'profound, marvelous') usually was used by women, relating them to [[Guanyin]], as [[Guanyin#Legend of Miao Shan|Miàoshàn]] (妙善) was her name at birth.

In a same way, taking the monastic vows meant the break with the family lineage, which was shown by application of the surname Shì ([[wikt:釋|釋]], [[Thich|Thích]] in Vietnam) in one's [[Dharma name]], the first character of [[Gautama Buddha]]'s title in Chinese: ''Shìjiāmóuní'' (釋迦牟尼, 'Śākyamuni', {{abbr|lit.|literally}} 'Sage of the Śakyas').
