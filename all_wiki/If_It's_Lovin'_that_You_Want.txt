"'''If It's Lovin' that You Want'''" is a song recorded by Barbadian singer [[Rihanna]], from her debut studio album ''[[Music of the Sun]]'' (2005). It was written by Samuel Barnes, [[Scott La Rock]], [[Makeba Riddick]], Jean-Claude Oliver, [[KRS-One|Lawrence Parker]], and produced by [[Trackmasters|Poke & Tone]]. It was released on August 16, 2005, as the second and final single from the album. The lyrics revolve around "basically telling a guy, 'If it's lovin' that you want, you should make me your girl because I've got what you need".<ref name="MTVNews1"/>

The song received mixed reviews from [[Music journalism|music critics]], many of whom praised and criticised Rihanna's vocal performance; its composition was also complimented. "If It's Lovin' that You Want" achieved moderate success around the world, reaching the top forty in few European countries, while reaching the top ten in Australia, Ireland and New Zealand. In the United States, the song failed to match the commercial success of Rihanna's previous single, "[[Pon de Replay]]", peaking at number 36 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart. It managed, however, to reach number nine on the [[Mainstream Top 40 (Pop Songs)|Pop Songs]] chart. The song's accompanying [[music video]], directed by [[Marcus Raboy]], was shot on a beach in California, and features the singer enjoying several activities, such as dancing and riding [[jet ski]]s with her friends.

The [[music video]] for the song was shot on a stretch of beach on the coast of [[California]] in [[Malibu, California|Malibu]] and directed by [[Marcus Raboy]].<ref name="MTVNews1"/> In an interview with MTV News, Rihanna spoke about the development of the shoot for the video, saying "The water was so cold&nbsp;... but oh my gosh, we had so much fun&nbsp;... We were bumping each other off the Jet Skis and just had a ball".<ref name="MTVNews1"/> During the interview, the singer elaborated further upon the content of the video and the meaning behind it, saying "This video is about having fun, giving off the vibe of the Caribbean&nbsp;... we did some mermaid-looking stuff down on the sand&nbsp;...and I'm just [performing] to the camera as if it were my boyfriend. Now we're going to do [some scenes with] the Tiki torches. It's going to be incredible".<ref name="MTVNews1"/>  The dance routines in the video were [[Choreography|choreographed]] by noted choreographer [[Fatima Robinson]].<ref name="MTVNews1"/>

The video begins with scenes of Rihanna dancing and walking along the beach and riding [[jet ski]]{{'}}s with her friends during the first chorus and continues into the first verse.<ref name="MTVNews1"/> Halfway through the first verse, a new scene of the singer is introduced, where she is dancing on a platform with four other female dancers, wearing a "short, flowing white skirt and a cropped tee",<ref name="MTVNews1"/>  with the ocean as the backdrop behind her. During the second chorus, the previous scenes are intercut with each other, and continue into the second verse, where a new scene of the singer wearing a different outfit and lying on the beach, whilst also choreographing with some male extras. For the third chorus, which is repeated twice, another new scene of Rihanna is shown with four other female dancers who [[belly dance]] in the middle of a [[Tiki culture|Tiki torch]] circle during the night.<ref name="MTVNews1"/>
