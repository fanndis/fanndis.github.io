</ref>{{Rp|7|date=November 2012}} A forcing is something that is imposed externally on the [[climate system]].

The climate system will show internal variability both in the presence and absence of forcings imposed on it, (see images opposite). This internal variability is a result of complex interactions between components of the climate system, such as the [[coupling (physics)|coupling]] between the atmosphere and ocean (see also the later section on [[Attribution of recent climate change#Internal climate variability and global warming|Internal climate variability and global warming]]).<ref>Albritton ''et al.'', [http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/010.htm Technical Summary], [http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/011.htm#box1 Box 1: What drives changes in climate?], in {{Harvnb|IPCC TAR WG1|2001}}.</ref> An example of internal variability is the [[El Niño–Southern Oscillation]].

Detection and attribution of climate signals, as well as its common-sense meaning, has a more precise definition within the climate change literature, as expressed by the IPCC.<ref>Mitchell ''et al.'', [http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/439.htm Chapter 12: Detection of Climate Change and Attribution of Causes], [http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/443.htm#1211 Section 12.1.1: The Meaning of Detection and Attribution], in {{Harvnb|IPCC TAR WG1|2001}}.</ref> Detection of a climate signal does not always imply significant attribution. The IPCC's [[IPCC Fourth Assessment Report|Fourth Assessment Report]] says "it is ''extremely likely'' that human activities have exerted a substantial net warming influence on climate since 1750," where "extremely likely" indicates a probability greater than 95%.<ref>{{harvnb|IPCC AR4 WG1|2007}}, chapter "[https://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/tssts-6.html TS.6 Robust Findings and Key Uncertainties] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181102212300/http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/tssts-6.html |date=2 November 2018 }}"</ref> ''Detection'' of a signal requires demonstrating that an observed change is [[Statistical significance|statistically significantly]] different from that which can be explained by natural internal variability.

''Attribution'' requires demonstrating that a signal is:
* unlikely to be due entirely to internal variability;
* consistent with the estimated responses to the given combination of anthropogenic and natural forcing
* not consistent with alternative, physically plausible explanations of recent climate change that exclude important elements of the given combination of forcings.

</ref> Deforestation both reduces the amount of carbon dioxide absorbed by deforested regions and releases greenhouse gases directly, together with aerosols, through [[slash and burn|biomass burning]] that frequently accompanies it.

Some of the causes of climate change are, generally, not connected with it directly in the [[media coverage of global warming|media coverage]]. For example, the harm done by humans to the populations of Elephants and Monkeys contributes to deforestation therefore to climate change.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Cimons |first1=Marlene |title=Elephants and Monkeys Are Working to Protect You From Climate Change |url=https://www.ecowatch.com/elephants-monkeys-climate-change-2639742120.html |accessdate=11 August 2019 |agency=Ecowatch |date=9 August 2019}}</ref>

A second reason that climate change has been attributed to land use is that the [[albedo|terrestrial albedo]] is often altered by use, which leads to [[radiative forcing]]. This effect is more significant locally than globally.<ref name="Technical Summary"/>

Over the past 150 years human activities have released increasing quantities of [[greenhouse gas]]es into the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]]. This has led to increases in mean global temperature, or [[global warming]]. Other human effects are relevant—for example, sulphate [[aerosol]]s are believed to have a cooling effect. Natural factors also contribute. According to the [[historical temperature record]] of the last century, the Earth's near-surface air temperature has risen around 0.74 [[Plus–minus sign|±]] 0.18&nbsp;°Celsius (1.3 ± 0.32&nbsp;°Fahrenheit).<ref>[https://www2.ucar.edu/climate/faq/how-much-has-global-temperature-risen-last-100-years UCAR FAQ: How much has global temp. risen over the past 100 years?]</ref>

A historically important question in climate change research has regarded the relative importance of human activity and non-[[human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] causes during the period of [[instrumental temperature record|instrumental record]]. In the 1995 [[IPCC Second Assessment Report|Second Assessment Report]] (SAR), the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|IPCC]] made the widely quoted statement that "The balance of evidence suggests a discernible human influence on global climate". The phrase "balance of evidence" suggested the (English) common-law standard of proof required in civil as opposed to criminal courts: not as high as "beyond reasonable doubt". In 2001 the [[IPCC Third Assessment Report|Third Assessment Report]] (TAR) refined this, saying "There is new and stronger evidence that most of the warming observed over the last 50 years is attributable to human activities".<ref name="WG1-2001-SPM"/> The 2007 [[IPCC Fourth Assessment Report|Fourth Assessment Report]] (AR4) strengthened this finding:
* "Anthropogenic warming of the climate system is widespread and can be detected in temperature observations taken at the surface, in the free atmosphere and in the oceans. Evidence of the effect of external influences, both anthropogenic and natural, on the climate system has continued to accumulate since the TAR."<ref>Solomon ''et al.'', [http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/ts.html Technical Summary], [http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/wg1/ar4-wg1-ts.pdf p. ?].{{page needed|date=September 2011}} in {{Harvnb|IPCC AR4 WG1|2007}}.</ref>

Other findings of the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report include:

In the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report, the following scale is used to quantify uncertainty: "virtually certain" >99%; "extremely likely" >95%; "very likely" >90%; "likely" >66%; "more likely than not" >50%; "about as likely as not" 33 to 66%; "unlikely" <33%; "very unlikely" <10%; "extremely unlikely" <5%; "exceptionally unlikely" <1%. {{citation

Over the past five decades there has been a global warming of approximately 0.65&nbsp;°C (1.17&nbsp;°F) at the Earth's surface (see [[historical temperature record]]). Among the possible factors that could produce changes in global mean temperature are internal variability of the climate system, external forcing, an increase in concentration of greenhouse gases, or any combination of these. Current studies indicate that the increase in greenhouse gases, most notably {{CO2}}, is mostly responsible for the observed warming. Evidence for this conclusion includes:

* Estimates of internal variability from climate models, and reconstructions of past temperatures, indicate that the warming is unlikely to be entirely natural.
* Climate models forced by natural factors ''and'' increased greenhouse gases and aerosols reproduce the observed global temperature changes; those forced by natural factors alone do not.<ref name="WG1-2001-SPM">IPCC, [http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/007.htm Summary for Policymakers].{{page needed|date=September 2011}} in {{Harvnb|IPCC TAR WG1|2001}}.</ref>

===Details on attribution===
Recent scientific assessments find that most of the warming of the Earth's surface over the past 50 years has been caused by human activities (see also the section on [[Attribution of recent climate change#Scientific literature and opinion|scientific literature and opinion]]). This conclusion rests on multiple lines of evidence. Like the warming "signal" that has gradually emerged from the "noise" of natural climate variability, the scientific evidence for a human influence on global climate has accumulated over the past several decades, from many hundreds of studies. No single study is a "[[smoking gun]]." Nor has any single study or combination of studies undermined the large body of evidence supporting the conclusion that human activity is the primary driver of recent warming.<!-- Most of the preceding paragraph drawn from the following reference: --><ref name=":0">{{Harvnb|Karl|others|2009}}, page 19.</ref>

The first line of evidence is based on a physical understanding of how greenhouse gases trap heat, how the climate system responds to increases in greenhouse gases, and how other human and natural factors influence climate. The second line of evidence is from indirect estimates of climate changes over the last 1,000 to 2,000 years. These records are obtained from living things and their remains (like [[tree ring]]s and [[coral]]s) and from physical quantities (like the ratio between lighter and heavier [[isotope]]s of [[oxygen]] in [[ice core]]s), which change in measurable ways as climate changes. The lesson from these data is that global surface temperatures over the last several decades are clearly unusual, in that they were higher than at any time during at least the past 400 years. For the [[Northern Hemisphere]], the recent temperature rise is clearly unusual in at least the last 1,000 years (see graph opposite).<!-- The preceding paragraph is from the following reference: --><ref name=":0" />

The third line of evidence is based on the broad, qualitative consistency between observed changes in climate and the computer model simulations of how climate would be expected to change in response to human activities. For example, when climate models are run with historical increases in greenhouse gases, they show gradual warming of the Earth and ocean surface, increases in ocean heat content and the temperature of the lower atmosphere, a [[current sea level rise|rise]] in global sea level, retreat of [[sea ice]] and snow cover, cooling of the [[stratosphere]], an increase in the amount of atmospheric water vapor, and changes in large-scale [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] and [[atmospheric pressure|pressure patterns]]. These and other aspects of modelled climate change are in agreement with observations.<!-- The preceding paragraph is from the following reference: --><ref name=":0" />

Human-caused forces have increasingly dominated.]]
Finally, there is extensive statistical evidence from so-called "fingerprint" studies. Each factor that affects climate produces a unique pattern of climate response, much as each person has a unique fingerprint. Fingerprint studies exploit these unique signatures, and allow detailed comparisons of modelled and observed climate change patterns. Scientists rely on such studies to attribute observed changes in climate to a particular cause or set of causes. In the real world, the climate changes that have occurred since the start of the [[Industrial Revolution]] are due to a complex mixture of human and natural causes. The importance of each individual influence in this mixture changes over time. Of course, there are not multiple Earths, which would allow an experimenter to change one factor at a time on each Earth, thus helping to isolate different fingerprints. Therefore, climate models are used to study how individual factors affect climate. For example, a single factor (like greenhouse gases) or a set of factors can be varied, and the response of the modelled climate system to these individual or combined changes can thus be studied.<!-- The preceding paragraph was copied from the following reference: --><ref name=":0" />

For example, when climate model simulations of the last century include all of the major influences on climate, both human-induced and natural, they can reproduce many important features of observed climate change patterns. When human influences are removed from the model experiments, results suggest that the surface of the Earth would actually have cooled slightly over the last 50 years. The clear message from fingerprint studies is that the observed warming over the last half-century cannot be explained by natural factors, and is instead caused primarily by human factors.<!-- The preceding paragraph was copied from the following reference: --><ref name=":0" />

Another fingerprint of human effects on climate has been identified by looking at a slice through the layers of the atmosphere, and studying the pattern of temperature changes from the surface up through the stratosphere (see the section on [[Attribution of recent climate change#Solar activity|solar activity]]). The earliest fingerprint work focused on changes in surface and atmospheric temperature. Scientists then applied fingerprint methods to a whole range of climate variables, identifying human-caused climate signals in the heat content of the oceans, the height of the [[tropopause]] (the boundary between the [[troposphere]] and [[stratosphere]], which has shifted upward by hundreds of feet in recent decades), the geographical patterns of precipitation, drought, surface pressure, and the [[surface runoff|runoff]] from major [[river basin]]s.<!-- The preceding paragraph was copied from the following reference: --><ref name=":1">{{Harvnb|Karl|others|2009}}, page 20.</ref>

Studies published after the appearance of the [[IPCC Fourth Assessment Report]] in 2007 have also found human fingerprints in the increased levels of atmospheric [[moisture]] (both close to the surface and over the full extent of the atmosphere), in the decline of [[Arctic sea ice]] extent, and in the patterns of changes in [[Arctic]] and [[Antarctic]] surface temperatures.<!-- The preceding paragraph was copied from the following reference: --><ref name=":1" />

The message from this entire body of work is that the climate system is telling a consistent story of increasingly dominant human influence – the changes in temperature, ice extent, moisture, and [[Atmospheric circulation|circulation]] patterns fit together in a physically consistent way, like pieces in a complex puzzle.<!-- The preceding paragraph was copied from the following reference: --><ref name=":2">{{Harvnb|Karl|others|2009}}, page 21.</ref>

Increasingly, this type of fingerprint work is shifting its emphasis. As noted, clear and compelling scientific evidence supports the case for a pronounced human influence on global climate. Much of the recent attention is now on climate changes at continental and regional scales, and on variables that can have large impacts on societies. For example, scientists have established causal links between human activities and the changes in [[snowpack]], maximum and minimum ([[Diurnal temperature variation|diurnal]]) temperature, and the seasonal timing of runoff over mountainous regions of the western United States. Human activity is likely to have made a substantial contribution to ocean surface temperature changes in [[hurricane]] formation regions. Researchers are also looking beyond the physical climate system, and are beginning to tie changes in the distribution and seasonal behaviour of plant and animal species to human-caused changes in temperature and precipitation.<!-- The preceding paragraph was copied from the following reference: --><ref name=":2" />

For over a decade, one aspect of the climate change story seemed to show a significant difference between models and observations. In the tropics, all models predicted that with a rise in greenhouse gases, the troposphere would be expected to warm more rapidly than the surface. Observations from weather balloons, satellites, and surface thermometers seemed to show the opposite behaviour (more rapid warming of the surface than the troposphere). This issue was a stumbling block in understanding the causes of climate change. It is now largely resolved. Research showed that there were large uncertainties in the [[satellite]] and [[weather balloon]] data. When uncertainties in models and observations are properly accounted for, newer observational data sets (with better treatment of known problems) are in agreement with climate model results.<!-- The preceding paragraph was copied from the following reference: --><ref name=":2" />

This does not mean, however, that all remaining differences between models and observations have been resolved. The observed changes in some climate variables, such as Arctic sea ice, some aspects of precipitation, and patterns of surface pressure, appear to be proceeding much more rapidly than models have projected. The reasons for these differences are not well understood. Nevertheless, the bottom-line conclusion from climate fingerprinting is that most of the observed changes studied to date are consistent with each other, and are also consistent with our scientific understanding of how the climate system would be expected to respond to the increase in heat-trapping gases resulting from human activities.<!-- The preceding paragraph was copied from the following reference: --><ref>{{Harvnb|Karl|others|2009}}, page 22.</ref>

The IPCC Fourth Assessment Report (2007), concluded that attribution was possible for a number of observed changes in the climate (see [[effects of global warming]]). However, attribution was found to be more difficult when assessing changes over smaller regions (less than continental scale) and over short time periods (less than 50 years).<ref name="hegerl 2007 executive summary">Hegerl ''et al.'', [http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/ch9.html Chapter 9: Understanding and Attributing Climate Change], [http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/ch9s9-es.html Executive Summary], in
{{Harvnb|IPCC AR4 WG1|2007}}.</ref>
Over larger regions, averaging reduces natural variability of the climate, making detection and attribution easier.

* In 1996, in a paper in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' titled "A search for human influences on the thermal structure of the atmosphere", [[Benjamin D. Santer]] et al. wrote: "The observed spatial patterns of temperature change in the free atmosphere from 1963 to 1987 are similar to those predicted by state-of-the-art climate models incorporating various combinations of changes in carbon dioxide, anthropogenic sulphate aerosol and stratospheric ozone concentrations. The degree of pattern similarity between models and observations increases through this period. It is likely that this trend is partially due to human activities, although many uncertainties remain, particularly relating to estimates of natural variability."
* A 2002 paper in the ''[[Journal of Geophysical Research]]'' says "Our analysis suggests that the early twentieth century warming can best be explained by a combination of warming due to increases in greenhouse gases and natural forcing, some cooling due to other anthropogenic forcings, and a substantial, but not implausible, contribution from internal variability. In the second half of the century we find that the warming is largely caused by changes in greenhouse gases, with changes in sulphates and, perhaps, volcanic aerosol offsetting approximately one third of the warming."<ref>{{Cite journal|author1=Tett SFB |authorlink1=Simon Tett |title=Estimation of natural and anthropogenic contributions to twentieth century temperature change |journal=J.

==Solar activity==
[[File:Solar irradiance and temperature 1880-2018.jpeg|thumb|upright=1.35|alt=The graph shows the solar irradiance without a long-term trend. The 11-year solar cycle is also visible. The temperature, in contrast, shows an upward trend.|Solar irradiance (yellow) plotted together with temperature (red) over 1880 to 2018.]]
[[File:Evidence of human-induced global warming - patterns of temperature change produced by various atmospheric factors, 1958-1999 (USGCRP).png|thumb|upright=1.35|Modeled simulation of the effect of various factors (including GHGs, Solar irradiance) singly and in combination, showing in particular that solar activity produces a small and nearly uniform warming, unlike what is observed.]]
[[Solar sunspot maximum]] occurs when the magnetic field of the Sun collapses and reverse as part of its average 11-year [[solar cycle]] (22 years for complete North to North restoration).

The role of the Sun in recent climate change has been looked at by climate scientists. Since 1978, [[solar variation|output from the Sun]] has been measured by [[satellite]]s<ref name=nrc2008/>{{Rp|6|date=November 2012}} significantly more accurately than was previously possible from the surface. These measurements indicate that the Sun's total [[solar irradiance]] has not increased since 1978, so the warming during the past 30 years cannot be directly attributed to an increase in total solar energy reaching the Earth (see graph above, left). In the three decades since 1978, the combination of solar and [[volcanic activity]] probably had a slight cooling influence on the climate.<ref>Global Climate Change, in {{Harvnb|Karl|others|2009}}, pp. 15–16.</ref>

Climate models have been used to examine the role of the Sun in recent climate change.<ref>Hegerl, ''et al''., [http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/ch9.html Chapter 9: Understanding and Attributing Climate Change], [http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/faq-9-2.html Frequently Asked Question 9.2: Can the Warming of the 20th century be Explained by Natural Variability?], in {{Harvnb|IPCC AR4 WG1|2007}}.</ref>
Models are unable to reproduce the rapid warming observed in recent decades when they only take into account variations in total solar irradiance and volcanic activity. Models are, however, able to simulate the observed 20th century changes in temperature when they include all of the most important external forcings, including human influences and natural forcings. As has already been stated, Hegerl ''et al.'' (2007) concluded that greenhouse gas forcing had "very likely" caused most of the observed global warming since the mid-20th century. In making this conclusion, Hegerl ''et al.'' (2007) allowed for the possibility that climate models had been underestimated the effect of solar forcing.<ref>Hegerl, ''et al''., [http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/ch9.html Chapter 9: Understanding and Attributing Climate Change], [http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/ch9s9-es.html Executive Summary], in

Models and observations (see figure above, middle) show that greenhouse gas results in warming of the lower atmosphere at the surface (called the [[troposphere]]) but cooling of the upper atmosphere (called the [[stratosphere]]).<ref>Hegerl ''et al.'', [http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/ch9.html Chapter 9: Understanding and Attributing Climate Change], [http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/faq-9-2.html Frequently Asked Question 9.2: Can the Warming of the 20th century be Explained by Natural Variability?], in {{Harvnb|IPCC AR4 WG1|2007}}. <!-- Hegerl --></ref> [[ozone depletion|Depletion]] of the [[ozone layer]] by chemical [[refrigerant]]s has also resulted in a cooling effect in the stratosphere. If the Sun was responsible for observed warming, warming of the troposphere at the surface and warming at the top of the stratosphere would be expected as increase solar activity would replenish ozone and [[Nitrogen oxide|oxides of nitrogen]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Karl|others|2009}}, p. 20.</ref> The stratosphere has a reverse temperature gradient than the troposphere so as the temperature of the troposphere cools with altitude, the stratosphere rises with altitude. [[Hadley cells]] are the mechanism by which equatorial generated ozone in the tropics (highest area of UV irradiance in the stratosphere) is moved poleward. Global climate models suggest that climate change may widen the Hadley cells and push the jetstream northward thereby expanding the tropics region and resulting in warmer, dryer conditions in those areas overall.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Celeste M.

(2009):<ref>{{harvnb|Duplissy|others|2009}}</ref><blockquote>The CLOUD experiments at [[CERN]] are interesting research but do not provide conclusive evidence that cosmic rays can serve as a major source of cloud seeding. Preliminary results from the experiment (Duplissy et al., 2009) suggest that though there was some evidence of ion mediated nucleation, for most of the nucleation events observed the contribution of ion processes appeared to be minor. These experiments also showed the difficulty in maintaining sufficiently clean conditions and stable temperatures to prevent spurious aerosol bursts. There is no indication that the earlier Svensmark experiments could even have matched the controlled conditions of the CERN experiment. We find that the Svensmark results on cloud seeding have not yet been shown to be robust or sufficient to materially alter the conclusions of the assessment literature, especially given the abundance of recent literature that is skeptical of the cosmic ray-climate linkage</blockquote>
