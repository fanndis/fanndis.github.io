=== Achievements ===
Major achievements of SpaceX are in the reuse of orbital-class launch vehicles and cost reduction in the space launch industry. Most notable of these being the continued landings and relaunches of the first stage of Falcon 9. As of August 2020, SpaceX has used a single first-stage booster, [[Falcon 9 booster B1049|B1049]], at most six times.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.teslarati.com/spacex-100th-launch-rocket-reuse-milestone/|title=SpaceX's 99th Falcon launch checks off new rocket booster reuse record [updated]|author=Eric Ralph|date=August 18, 2020|publisher=Teslarati|access-date=August 20, 2020|archive-date=August 19, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200819144328/https://www.teslarati.com/spacex-100th-launch-rocket-reuse-milestone/|url-status=live}}</ref> SpaceX is defined as a private space company and thus its achievements can also be counted as firsts by a private company.

===Accidents===

In March 2013, a [[SpaceX Dragon|Dragon spacecraft]] in [[orbit]] developed issues with its thrusters that limited its control capabilities. SpaceX engineers were able to remotely clear the blockages within a short period, and the spacecraft was able to successfully complete its mission to and from the [[International Space Station]].

In late June 2015, [[SpaceX CRS-7|CRS-7]] launched a [[SpaceX Dragon|Cargo Dragon]] atop a [[Falcon 9]] to resupply the [[International Space Station]]. All [[telemetry]] readings were nominal until 2 minutes and 19 seconds into the flight when a loss of helium pressure was detected and a cloud of vapor appeared outside the second stage. A few seconds after this, the second stage exploded. The first stage continued to fly for a few seconds before disintegrating due to [[Dynamic pressure|aerodynamic forces]]. The capsule was thrown off and survived the explosion, transmitting data until it was destroyed on impact.<ref name="Stephen Clark for spaceflightnow.com">{{cite web|url=https://spaceflightnow.com/2015/07/20/support-strut-probable-cause-of-falcon-9-failure/|title=Support strut probable cause of Falcon 9 failure|date=July 20, 2015|publisher=Spaceflight Now|author=Stephen Clark|accessdate=March 1, 2017|archive-date=February 17, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170217222505/http://spaceflightnow.com/2015/07/20/support-strut-probable-cause-of-falcon-9-failure/|url-status=dead}}</ref> Later it was revealed that the capsule could have landed intact if it had [[software]] to deploy its parachutes in case of a launch mishap.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spacex.com/news/2015/07/20/crs-7-investigation-update|title=CRS-7 Investigation Update|date=July 20, 2015|publisher=SpaceX|accessdate=March 1, 2017|archive-date=March 26, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170326154026/http://www.spacex.com/news/2015/07/20/crs-7-investigation-update|url-status=dead}}</ref> The problem was discovered to be a failed 2-foot-long steel strut purchased from a supplier<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/atoms/files/public_summary_nasa_irt_spacex_crs-7_final.pdf|title=NASA Independent Review Team [IRT] SpaceX CRS-7 Accident Investigation Report Public Summary|publisher=NASA|accessdate=March 12, 2018|archive-date=May 7, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180507102503/https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/atoms/files/public_summary_nasa_irt_spacex_crs-7_final.pdf|url-status=live}} "… the key technical finding by the IRT with regard to this failure was that it was due to a design error: SpaceX chose to use an industrial grade (as opposed to aerospace grade) 17-4 PH SS (precipitation-hardening stainless steel) cast part (the “Rod End”) in a critical load path under cryogenic conditions and strenuous flight environments. The implementation was done without adequate screening or testing of the industrial grade part, without regard to the manufacturer’s recommendations for a 4:1 factor of safety when using their industrial grade part in an application, and without proper modeling or adequate load testing of the part under predicted flight conditions.

Congressional testimony by SpaceX in 2017 suggested that the NASA [[Space Act Agreement]] process of "setting only a [[Requirement#Types of requirement|high-level requirement]] for cargo transport to the space station [while] leaving the details to industry" had allowed SpaceX to design and develop the Falcon 9 rocket on its own at a substantially lower cost. According to [[NASA|NASA's]] own independently verified numbers, SpaceX's total development cost for both the Falcon 1 and Falcon 9 rockets was estimated at approximately {{USD|390 million}}. In 2011, NASA estimated that it would have cost the agency about {{USD|4 billion}} to develop a rocket like the Falcon 9 booster based upon NASA's traditional contracting processes, about ten times more.<ref name=":5">{{Cite web|url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20170008895.pdf|title=An Assessment of Cost Improvements in the NASA COTS/CRS Program and Implications for Future NASA Missions|last=Zapata|first=Edgar|date=|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190617200937/https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20170008895.pdf|archive-date=June 17, 2019|url-status=live|access-date=}}</ref>

SpaceX is developing a super-heavy lift launch system, [[SpaceX Starship|Starship]]. Starship is a [[reusable launch vehicle|fully reusable]] [[second stage]] and [[space vehicle]] intended to replace all of the company's existing launch vehicle hardware by the early 2020s; plus ground infrastructure for rapid launch and relaunch and zero-gravity propellant transfer technology in [[low Earth orbit]] (LEO).

SpaceX initially envisioned a 12-meter-diameter ITS concept in 2016 which was solely aimed at Mars transit and other interplanetary uses. In 2017, SpaceX articulated a smaller 9-meter-diameter BFR to replace all of SpaceX launch service provider capabilities—Earth-orbit, lunar-orbit, interplanetary missions, and potentially, even intercontinental passenger transport on Earth—but do so on a fully reusable set of vehicles with a markedly lower cost structure.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.engadget.com/2017/09/29/space-x-mars-bfr-elon-musk/|title=Elon Musk's Mars dream hinges on a giant new rocket|work=Engadget|access-date=March 29, 2018|language=en-US|archive-date=March 2, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180302123318/https://www.engadget.com/2017/09/29/space-x-mars-bfr-elon-musk/|url-status=live}}</ref> A large portion of the components on Starship are made of 301 [[stainless steel]].

The company purchased the McGregor facilities from [[Beal Aerospace]], where it refitted the largest test stand for [[Falcon 9]] engine testing. SpaceX has made a number of improvements to the facility since purchase and has also extended the acreage by purchasing several pieces of adjacent farmland. In 2011, the company announced plans to upgrade the facility for launch testing a VTVL rocket,<ref name=satspot20110926/> and then constructed a half-acre concrete launch facility in 2012 to support the Grasshopper test flight program.<ref name=sfn20120709/> {{as of|2012|10}}, the McGregor facility had seven test stands that are operated "18 hours a day, six days a week"<ref name="wired20121010">{{cite web |author=Jason Paur |title=Inside SpaceX's Texas Rocket-Testing Facility |url=https://www.wired.com/2012/10/spacex-texas-rocket-test/ |publisher=Wired |date=October 10, 2012 |accessdate=March 1, 2017 |archive-date=March 6, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170306034148/https://www.wired.com/2012/10/spacex-texas-rocket-test/ |url-status=live }}</ref> and is building more test stands because production is ramping up and the company has a large [[List of Falcon 9 launches#Launch Manifest|manifest]] in the next several years. {{update after|2013}}
