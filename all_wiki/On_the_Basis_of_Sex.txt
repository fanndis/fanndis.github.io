'''''On the Basis of Sex''''' is a 2018 American [[Biographical film|biographical]] [[legal drama]] film based on the life and early cases of Supreme Court Justice [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]], who became the second woman to serve on the [[United States Supreme Court]]. Directed by [[Mimi Leder]] and written by Daniel Stiepleman, it stars [[Felicity Jones]] as Ginsburg, with [[Armie Hammer]], [[Justin Theroux]], [[Jack Reynor]], [[Cailee Spaeny]], [[Sam Waterston]], and [[Kathy Bates]] in supporting roles.

The film had its world premiere at the [[AFI Fest]] on November 8, 2018, and was theatrically released in the United States on December 25, 2018, by [[Focus Features]]. The film received generally favorable reviews from critics, who praised Jones' performance; some critics praised the film's intricacy and pacing at a dramatic level, other critics regarded the film as a whole predictable, over-packaged, and hagiographic.<ref>{{cite web|title=On the Basis of Sex review roundup: What the critics are saying about the Felicity Jones-starring Ruth Bader Ginsburg biopic|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/on-the-basis-of-sex-review-roundup-felicity-jones-ruth-bader-ginsburg-biopic-a8693906.html|author=Jack Shepard|website=[[The Independent]]|date=December 21, 2018|accessdate=December 25, 2018}}</ref>

== Plot ==

In 1956, [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]] is a first-year student at [[Harvard Law School]]. When her husband [[Martin D. Ginsburg|Martin]], a second-year student, is diagnosed with [[testicular cancer]], she attends both her classes and his, taking notes and transcribing lectures while caring for Martin and their infant daughter [[Jane C. Ginsburg|Jane]]. Two years later, Martin, his cancer in remission, is hired by a firm in New York. Ruth petitions [[Erwin Griswold|Harvard Law School Dean Griswold]] to allow her to complete her Harvard law degree with classes at [[Columbia Law School]] in New York, but he insists on following [[Harvard University]] policies at the time and denies her request, so she transfers to Columbia. In spite of graduating at the top of her class, she is unable to find a position with a law firm because none of the firms she applies to want to hire a woman. She takes a job as a professor at [[Rutgers Law School]], teaching "Sex Discrimination and the Law".

In 1970, Martin brings ''[[Moritz v. Commissioner]]'', a tax law case, to Ruth's attention. Charles Moritz is a man from [[Denver]] who had to hire a nurse to help him care for his aging mother so he could continue to work. Moritz was denied a tax deduction for the nursing care because at the time Section 214 of the [[Internal Revenue Code]] specifically limited the deduction to "a woman, a widower or divorcée, or a husband whose wife is incapacitated or institutionalized". The court ruled that Moritz, a man who had never married, did not qualify for the deduction. Ruth sees in this case an opportunity to begin to challenge the many laws enacted over the years that assume that men will work to provide for the family, and women will stay home and take care of the husband and children. She believes that if she could set a precedent ruling that a man was unfairly discriminated against on the basis of sex, that precedent could be cited in cases challenging laws that discriminate against women{{mdash}}and she believes that an appellate court composed entirely of male judges would find it easier to identify with a male appellant.

Ruth meets with Mel Wulf of the [[American Civil Liberties Union|ACLU]] to try to enlist their help, but he turns her down. Ruth flies to Denver to meet with Moritz, who agrees to let the Ginsburgs and ACLU represent him ''pro bono'' after Ruth convinces him that millions of people could potentially benefit.  After reading the draft of the brief, [[Dorothy Kenyon]], who was cold to the idea at first, meets with Wulf in his office and convinces him to sign on. The Ginsburgs and Wulf file an appeal of Moritz's denial with the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit|Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals]]. Department of Justice Attorney James H. Bozarth asks to be the lead counsel for the defense. He does a computer search to find all of the sections of the US Code that deal with gender. His defense will contend that, if section 214 is ruled unconstitutional, that will open the door to challenge all of America's gender-based laws. Ruth, having no courtroom experience, does poorly in a moot court, and Wulf convinces her to let Martin lead off arguing the tax law, with Ruth following up with [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|equal protection]] arguments.

The government offers Moritz a settlement of one dollar. Ruth makes a counter-proposal: the government will pay Moritz the sum he claimed as a deduction and make a declaration that he did nothing wrong, and also enter into the record that the gender-based portion of section 214 is unconstitutional. The government declines this proposal because of the constitutionality element. At the oral argument in the Court of Appeals, Martin takes more of their side's allotted time than he had intended. Ruth is nervous but makes several key points and reserves four minutes of her time for rebuttal. Bozarth frames his side's argument as defending the American way of life, implying that the Ginsburgs and ACLU want "radical social change" and maybe Moritz "just doesn't want to pay his taxes". In her rebuttal, Ruth is much more confident.  She states that societal roles that existed one hundred years ago, or even twenty years ago, no longer apply. She does not ask the court to change society, but to keep the law up with social change that has already taken place.  To a judge's objection that the Constitution does not contain the word "woman", she responds vigorously that neither does it contain the word "freedom".<ref>"Freedom of speech, or of the press" appears in the First Amendment to the Constitution, which is not in the body of the text itself but in an amendment.  [[First Amendment#Text|First Amendment]].</ref>

Outside the courthouse, judgment being reserved, Wulf, Moritz and the Ginsburgs celebrate that, win or lose, Ruth has finally found her voice as a lawyer. Titles over the closing scene indicate that the Court of Appeals found unanimously in Moritz's favor. Ruth went on to co-found the Women's Rights Project at the ACLU, which struck down many of the gender-based laws Bozarth identified, and in 1993 the Senate voted 96 to 3 for her to become an associate justice of the United States Supreme Court. The final scene shows the real-life Ginsburg walking up the steps of the Supreme Court building.

[[A. O. Scott]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' noted that the film stays close to the true story of Ginsburg's emergence as a leading women's rights attorney and wrote: "That the movie may leave you wanting more — more history, more personality, more complicated emotion, more ideological contention — doesn't necessarily count against it. Historical narratives are best when they pique curiosity as well as satisfy it..."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/24/movies/on-the-basis-of-sex-review.html|title=On the Basis of Sex' Review: How Ruth Bader Ginsburg Became 'Notorious'|author= A, O, Scott|work=New York Times|date=December 24, 2018|accessdate=January 22, 2019|quote=The real Justice Ginsburg has said that the only thing the movie gets factually wrong is that it portrays her at a momentary loss for words as she addresses the court for the first time.}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Grady |first=Constance |url=https://www.vox.com/2015/6/29/8853365/rbg-ginsburg-gay-marriage |title=Notorious RBG: Ruth Bader Ginsburg's journey from ACLU lawyer to pop culture icon |publisher=Vox |date=June 29, 2015 |accessdate=January 22, 2019}}</ref>
