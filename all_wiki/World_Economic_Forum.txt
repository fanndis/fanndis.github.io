The '''World Economic Forum''' ('''WEF'''), based in [[Cologny]], [[Geneva Canton]], [[Switzerland]], is an [[International non-governmental organization|international NGO]], founded in 1971. The WEF's mission is stated as "committed to improving the state of the world by engaging business, political, academic, and other leaders of society to shape global, regional, and industry agendas".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.weforum.org/about/world-economic-forum|title=World Economic Forum: Our Mission}}</ref>

The WEF hosts an annual meeting at the end of January in [[Davos]], a mountain resort in [[Graubünden]], in the eastern [[Alps]] region of Switzerland. The meeting brings together some 3,000 business leaders, international political leaders, [[economist]]s, celebrities and journalists for up to five days to discuss [[global issues]], across 500 sessions.

The organization also convenes some six to eight regional meetings each year in locations across Africa, East Asia, Latin America, and India and holds two further annual meetings in China and the [[United Arab Emirates]]. Beside meetings, the organization provides a platform for leaders from all stakeholder groups from around the world – business, government and [[civil society]] – to collaborate on multiple projects and initiatives.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.weforum.org/platforms|title=World Economic Forum: Our Platforms}}</ref> It also produces a series of reports and engages its members in sector-specific initiatives.<ref name="Pigman p41-42">Pigman. pp. 41–42.</ref>

The World Economic Forum and its annual meeting in Davos are criticised regarding the public cost of security, the formation of a wealthy [[global elite]] without attachment to the broader societies, [[#Undemocratic decision making|undemocratic]] decision processes, [[#Gender debate|gender issues]] and a lack of [[#Lack of financial transparency|financial transparency]].

The WEF was founded in 1971 by [[Klaus Schwab]], a business professor at the [[University of Geneva]].<ref>Pigman. pp. 6–22.</ref> First named the '''European Management Forum''', it changed its name to the World Economic Forum in 1987 and sought to broaden its vision to include providing a platform for resolving international conflicts.

In the summer of 1971, Schwab invited 444 executives from [[Western European]] firms to the first European Management Symposium held in the [[Davos Congress Centre]] under the patronage of the [[European Commission]] and European industrial associations, where Schwab sought to introduce European firms to American management practices. He then founded the WEF as a nonprofit organization based in Geneva and drew European business leaders to Davos for the annual meetings each January.<ref>Kellerman. p. 229.</ref>

Events in 1973, including the collapse of the [[Bretton Woods system|Bretton Woods]] fixed-exchange rate mechanism and the [[Yom Kippur War]], saw the annual meeting expand its focus from management to economic and social issues, and, for the first time, political leaders were invited to the annual meeting in January 1974.<ref>{{Registration required|date=January 2011}} [http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/0304411c-c5e8-11dc-8378-0000779fd2ac,dwp_uuid=01b19234-b4b2-11dc-990a-0000779fd2ac.html?nclick_check=1 "Interview: Klaus Schwab"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090604034329/http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/0304411c-c5e8-11dc-8378-0000779fd2ac%2Cdwp_uuid%3D01b19234-b4b2-11dc-990a-0000779fd2ac.html?nclick_check=1 |date=4 June 2009 }}.''[[Financial Times]]''. 22 January 2008.

Political leaders soon began to use the annual meeting as venue for promoting their interests. The ''Davos Declaration'' was signed in 1988 by Greece and Turkey, helping them turn back from the brink of war. In 1992, South African President [[F. W. de Klerk]] met with [[Nelson Mandela]] and [[Mangosuthu Buthelezi|Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi]] at the annual meeting, their first joint appearance outside South Africa. At the 1994 annual meeting, Israeli Foreign Minister [[Shimon Peres]] and [[Chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization|PLO chairman]] [[Yasser Arafat]] reached a draft agreement on [[Gaza City|Gaza]] and [[Jericho]].<ref>Lowe, Felix (14 January 2008).

In October 2004, the World Economic Forum gained attention through the resignation of its CEO<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2004/10/ceo_resigns/|title=CEO resigns}}</ref> and executive director [[José María Figueres]] over the undeclared receipt of more than USD 900,000 in consultancy fees from the French telecommunications firm [[Alcatel-Lucent|Alcatel]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/wef-director-resigns-over-undeclared-fees/4171240|title=WEF director resigns over undeclared fees}}</ref>

In January 2006, the WEF published an article in its Global Agenda magazine titled ”Boycott Israel”, which was distributed to all 2,340 participants of the Annual Meeting.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fastcompany.com/673871/scandal-davos|title=Scandal At Davos}}</ref> Following the publication, the WEF excused the publication as "an unacceptable failure in the editorial process".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2006-01-25/the-scandal-at-davos|title=Scandal At DavosThe Scandal at Davos|first=Bruce|last=Nussbaum}}</ref>

In late 2015, the invitation was extended to include a North Korean delegation for the 2016 WEF, "in view of positive signs coming out of the country", the WEF organizers noted. North Korea has not been attending the WEF since 1998. The invitation was accepted but after the [[January 2016 North Korean nuclear test]] on 6 January, the invitation was revoked, and the country's delegation was made subject to "existing and possible forthcoming sanctions".<ref>Keaten Jamey, ''AP'' (13 January 2016).

In 2017, the WEF in Davos attracted considerable attention when for the first time, a head of state from the [[China|People's Republic of China]] was present at the alpine resort. With the backdrop of [[Brexit]], an incoming [[protectionist]] US administration and significant pressures on [[free trade zone]]s and [[trade agreement]]s, [[Paramount leader]] [[Xi Jinping]] defended the global economic scheme, and portrayed China as a responsible nation and a leader for environmental causes. He sharply rebuked the current populist movements that would introduce tariffs and hinder global commerce, warning that such protectionism could foster isolation and reduced economic opportunity.<ref>P.

In 2018, Indian Prime Minister [[Narendra Modi]] gave the plenary speech, becoming the first head of state from India to deliver the inaugural keynote for the annual meet at Davos. Modi highlighted [[global warming]] (climate change), terrorism and protectionism as the three major global challenges, and expressed confidence that they can be tackled with collective effort.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.livemint.com/Politics/zoGD1tD80dF755GW9xZkyJ/Narendra-Modi-in-Davos-LIVE-PM-to-address-World-Economic-Fo.html|title=WEF Davos 2018 highlights: Narendra Modi warns of three global threats|last=Livemint|date=2018-01-23|work=livemint.com/|access-date=2018-02-08}}</ref>

In 2019, Brazilian President [[Jair Bolsonaro]] gave the keynote address at the plenary session of the conference. On his first international trip to Davos, he emphasized liberal economic policies despite his populist agenda, and attempted to reassure the world that [[Brazil]] is a protector of the [[rain forest]] while utilizing its resources for food production and export. He stated that "his government will seek to better integrate Brazil into the world by mainstreaming international best practices, such as those adopted and promoted by the [[OECD]]".<ref>[http://www.itamaraty.gov.br/en/speeches-articles-and-interviews/president-of-the-federative-republic-of-brazil-speeches/19992-discurso-del-presidente-de-la-republica-jair-bolsonaro-durante-la-sesion-plenaria-del-foro-economico-mundial-davos-suiza-22-de-enero-de-2020 Speech by the President of the Republic, Jair Bolsonaro, at the Plenary Session of the World Economic Forum – Davos, Switzerland, January 22, 2019].

In 2020, the Swiss police made the public aware that two "Russian spies", one of which was disguised as a plumber, had travelled to Davos with diplomatic passports prior to the Annual Meeting.

==Organization==
Headquartered in Cologny, the WEF also has offices in New York, Beijing and Tokyo. In January 2015 it was designated an NGO with "other international body" status by the Swiss Federal Government under the Swiss Host-State Act.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.weforum.org/press/2015/01/world-economic-forum-gains-formal-status-in-switzerland|title=Press Release: World Economic Forum Gains Formal Status in Switzerland|date=23 January 2015}}</ref> 

On October 10, 2016, the WEF announced the opening of its new Center for the Fourth Industrial Revolution in San Francisco. According to the WEF, the center will "serve as a platform for interaction, insight and impact on the scientific and technological changes that are changing the way we live, work and relate to one another".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.weforum.org/press/2016/10/new-forum-center-to-advance-global-cooperation-on-fourth-industrial-revolution/|title=New Forum Center to Advance Global Cooperation on Fourth Industrial Revolution|website=World Economic Forum|access-date=2016-11-20}}</ref>

The World Economic Forum claims to be [[impartial]] and that it is not tied to any political, [[partisan (political)|partisan]], or national interests.  Until 2012, it had [[observer status]] with the [[United Nations Economic and Social Council]], when it was revoked; it is under the supervision of the [[Swiss Federal Council]]. The foundation's highest governance body is the foundation board.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.weforum.org/content/leadership-team |title=The Leadership Team &#124; World Economic Forum-The Leadership Team |publisher=Weforum.org |access-date=22 January 2012}}</ref>

The WEF is chaired by Founder and Executive Chairman Professor [[Klaus Schwab]] and is guided by a Board of Trustees that is made up of leaders from business, politics, academia and civil society. Members of the Board of Trustees include: [[Mukesh Ambani]], [[Marc Benioff]], [[Peter Brabeck-Letmathe]], [[Mark Carney]], [[Laurence D.

===Membership===
The foundation is funded by its 1,000 member companies, typically global enterprises with more than five billion dollars in turnover (varying by industry and region). These enterprises rank among the top companies within their industry and/or country and play a leading role in shaping the future of their industry and/or region. Membership is stratified by the level of engagement with forum activities, with the level of membership fees increasing as participation in meetings, projects, and initiatives rises.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.weforum.org/members |title=Members &#124; World Economic Forum-Members |publisher=Weforum.org |access-date=22 January 2012}}</ref> In 2011 an annual membership cost $52,000 for an individual member, $263,000 for "Industry Partner" and $527,000 for "Strategic Partner".

"A white badge means you're one of the delegates – you might be the chief executive of a company or the leader of a country (although that would also get you a little holographic sticker to add to your badge), or a senior journalist.

In the beginning of the 21st century, the forum began to increasingly deal with environmental issues.<ref>{{cite web |title=Environment and Natural Resource Security |url=https://www.weforum.org/agenda/archive/environment-and-natural-resource-security |website=World Economic Forum |publisher=World Economic Forum |access-date=3 May 2020}}</ref> In the Davos Manifesto 2020 it is said that a company among other: 

"acts as a steward of the environmental and material universe for future generations. It consciously protects our biosphere and champions a circular, shared and regenerative economy." 

"responsibly manages near-term, medium-term and long-term value creation in pursuit of sustainable shareholder returns that do not sacrifice the future for the present." 

"is more than an economic unit generating wealth. It fulfils human and societal aspirations as part of the broader social system. Performance must be measured not only on the return to shareholders, but also on how it achieves its environmental, social and good governance objectives."<ref>{{cite web |last1=Schwab |first1=Klaus |title=Davos Manifesto 2020: The Universal Purpose of a Company in the Fourth Industrial Revolution |url=https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/12/davos-manifesto-2020-the-universal-purpose-of-a-company-in-the-fourth-industrial-revolution/ |website=World Economic Forum |publisher=World Economic Forum |access-date=3 May 2020}}</ref>

The Environmental Initiative covers climate change and water issues. Under the [[2005 G8 Summit|Gleneagles Dialogue on Climate Change]], the [[government of the United Kingdom|U.K. government]] asked the World Economic Forum at the [[31st G8 summit|G8 Summit in Gleneagles in 2005]] to facilitate a dialogue with the business community to develop recommendations for reducing [[greenhouse gas emissions]].

In 2016 WEF published an article in which it is said, that in some cases reducing consumption can increase the life level. In the article is mentioned that in [[Costa Rica]] the GDP is 4 times smaller than in many countries in Western Europe and North America, but people live longer and better. An American study shows that when the income is higher than 75,000$, an increase in profits does not increase well being. For better measuring the well being, the New Economics Foundation’s has launched the [[Happy Planet Index]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Belton |first1=Teresa |title=Why becoming a 'happily modest consumer' could help save the planet |url=https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/12/want-to-protect-the-planet-pursue-personal-happiness |website=World Economic Forum |access-date=24 May 2020}}</ref>.

In January 2017, WEF launched the 'Platform for Accelerating the Circular Economy' (PACE), which is a global [[public private partnership]] seeking to scale [[circular economy]] innovations.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.weforum.org/projects/circular-economy/|title=Circular Economy|website=World Economic Forum}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://toplink.weforum.org/knowledge/insight/a1Gb0000000pTDMEA2/explore/summary|title=TopLink|website=toplink.weforum.org}}</ref> PACE is co-chaired by [[Frans van Houten]] (CEO of [[Philips]]), Naoko Ishii (CEO of the [[Global Environment Facility]], and the head of [[United Nations Environment Programme]] (UNEP).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.acceleratecirculareconomy.org/|title=Platform for Accelerating the Circular Economy|website=Platform for Accelerating the Circular Economy}}</ref> The [[Ellen MacArthur Foundation]], the [[International Resource Panel]], Circle Economy and [[Accenture]] serve as knowledge partners.

The Forum emphasized its 'Environment and Natural Resource Security Initiative' for the 2017 meeting to achieve inclusive economic growth and sustainable practices for global industries. With increasing limitations on [[International trade|world trade]] through national interests and trade barriers, the WEF has moved towards a more sensitive and socially-minded approach for global businesses with a focus on the reduction of [[carbon emission]]s in China and other large industrial nations.<ref>[https://www.weforum.org/system-initiatives/environment-and-natural-resource-security ''Shaping the Future of Environment and Natural Resource Security''] The World Economic Forum Davos 2017.

The World Economic Forum is working to eliminate plastic pollution, stating that by the year 2050 it will consume 15% of the global [[Emissions budget|carbon budget]] and will pass by its weight fishes in the world's oceans.

The theme of 2020 World Economic Forum annual meeting was "Stakeholders for a Cohesive and Sustainable World". Climate change and sustainability were central themes of discussion. Many argued that GDP is failed to represent correctly the wellbeing and that fossil fuel subsidies should be stopped. Many of the participants said that a better capitalism is needed. [[Al Gore]] summarized the ideas in the conference as: “I don’t want to be naive, but I want to acknowledge that the center of the global economy is now saying things that many of us have dreamed they might for a long time,” "“The version of capitalism we have today in our world must be reformed,”.<ref>{{cite news |last1=WORLAND |first1=JUSTIN |title=How Davos Became a Climate Change Conference |url=https://time.com/5771889/davos-climate-change/ |access-date=31 January 2020 |agency=Times |date=27 January 2020}}</ref> 

In this meeting the World Economic Forum:

* Launched the [[Trillion Tree Campaign]] an initiative aiming to "grow, restore and conserve 1 trillion trees over the next 10 years around the world - in a bid to restore [[biodiversity]] and help fight [[climate change]]". [[Donald Trump]] joined the initiative. The forum stated that: "Nature-based solutions – locking-up carbon in the world’s forests, grasslands and wetlands – can provide up to one-third of the emissions reductions required by 2030 to meet the Paris Agreement targets," adding that the rest should come from the heavy industry, finance and transportation sectors. One of the targets is to unify existing [[reforestation]] projects<ref>{{cite web |last1=Pomeroy |first1=Robin |title=One trillion trees - World Economic Forum launches plan to help nature and the climate |url=https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/01/one-trillion-trees-world-economic-forum-launches-plan-to-help-nature-and-the-climate |website=World Economic Forum |access-date=12 March 2020}}</ref>

* Discussed the issue of climate change and called to expanding [[Renewable energy|renewable energy]], [[efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] change the patterns of [[Resource consumption|consumption]] and remove carbon from the atmosphere. The forum claimed that the climate crisis will become a climate apocalypse if the temperature will rise by 2 degree. The forum called to fulfill the commitments in [[Paris Agreement]]. [[Jennifer Morgan executive director of Greenpeace international|Jennifer Morgan]] the executive director of [[Greenpeace]] said that as to the beginning  of the forum, fossil fuels still get 3 times more money than climate solutions<ref>{{cite web |last1=Pomeroy |first1=Robin |title=What you need to know about Davos 2020: How to save the planet |url=https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/01/how-to-save-the-planet-davos-climate-pollution-what-to-know/ |website=World Economic Forum |publisher=World Economic Forum |access-date=3 May 2020}}</ref>
===== Coronavirus and Green recovery =====
In April 2020, the forum published an article that postulates that the [[COVID-19 pandemic]] is linked to the destruction of nature. The number of emerging diseases is rising and this rise is linked to [[Deforestation]] and [[Species loss]]. In the article, there are multiple examples of the degradation of ecological systems caused by humans. It is also says that half of the global [[GDP]] is moderately or largely dependent on nature. The article concludes that the recovery from the pandemic should be linked to nature recovery.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Quinney |first1=Marie |title=COVID-19 and nature are linked.

{{main|The Great Reset}}
In May 2020, the WEF and the [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince of Wales]]'s Sustainable Markets Initiative launched "The Great Reset" project, a five-point plan concerned with enhancing sustainable economic growth following the global recession caused by the [[COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/03/pandemic-is-chance-to-reset-global-economy-says-prince-charles|title=Pandemic is chance to reset global economy, says Prince Charles|newspaper=The Guardian|first=Phillip|last=Inman|date=3 June 2020|access-date=3 June 2020}}</ref> "The Great Reset" will be the theme of WEF's Annual Meeting in January 2021.<ref>[https://www.weforum.org/great-reset/about 'The Great Reset: A Unique Twin Summit to Begin 2021'], website WEF, 3 June 2020.</ref> In November&nbsp;2020, a conspiracy theory spread alleging a cabal of elites planned for a pandemic so they could secure greater levels of global economic control, and possibly societal control, like the [[New World Order (conspiracy theory)|New World Order]].<ref name="contheory1120">{{cite news |last1=Alba |first1=Davey |title=The baseless ‘Great Reset’ conspiracy theory rises again. |url=https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/11/17/world/covid-19-coronavirus#the-baseless-great-reset-conspiracy-theory-rises-again |access-date=November 18, 2020 |work=The New York Times |date=November 2020}}</ref><ref name="dot111620">{{cite news |last1=Goforth |first1=Claire |title=Trudeau speech reignites conspiracy theory fervor over 'Great Reset' |url=https://www.dailydot.com/debug/great-reset-conspiracy-theory/ |access-date=November 16, 2020 |work=The Daily Dot |date=November 16, 2020}}</ref>

==Criticism==
{{undue|section|date=November 2020}}
[[File:Demo-gegen-wef.jpg|thumb|Protest march against the WEF in [[Basel]], 2006.]]

During the late 1990s the foundation, along with the [[G7]], [[World Bank]], [[World Trade Organization]], and [[International Monetary Fund]], came under heavy criticism by [[anti-globalization]] activists who claimed that capitalism and globalization were increasing poverty and destroying the environment. Ten thousand demonstrators disrupted a regional meeting of the World Economic Forum in [[Melbourne]], obstructing the path of two hundred delegates to the meeting.<ref>Barret, Bernard (15 November 2000). [http://www.australianpolitics.com/pg/groups/barrett-s11-report-2000.shtml "Beating Up – A Report on Police Batons and the News Media at the World Economic Forum, Melbourne, September 2000"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110926220221/http://www.australianpolitics.com/pg/groups/barrett-s11-report-2000.shtml |date=26 September 2011 }}.

After 2014, the protest movement against the World Economic Forum largely died down, and [[Swiss police]] noted a significant decline in attending protesters, 20 at most during the meeting in 2016. While protesters are still more numerous in large Swiss cities, the protest movement itself has undergone significant change.<ref>C. Thumshirn (2017).

===Growing wealth gaps===
A number of NGOs have used the World Economic Forum to highlight growing inequalities and [[wealth gap]]s. [[Winnie Byanyima]], the executive director of the anti-poverty confederation [[Oxfam International]] co-chaired the 2015 meeting, where she presented a critical report of global wealth distribution based on statistical research by the [[Credit Suisse|Credit Suisse Research Institute]]. In this study, the richest one percent of people in the world own forty-eight percent of the world's wealth.<ref>Vara, Vauhini (January 2015).

Retrieved 27 January 2019.</ref> At the 2019 meeting, she presented another report claiming that the gap between rich and poor has only increased. The report “Public Good or Private Wealth” stated that 2,200 billionaires worldwide saw their wealth grow by 12 percent while the poorest half saw its wealth fall by 11 percent. Oxfam calls for a global tax overhaul to increase and harmonise global tax rates for corporations and wealthy individuals.<ref>Taylor, Chloe (January 2019).

===Public cost of security===
In September 2018, the city of Davos approved by popular vote to increase the security budget for the yearly meeting to CHF 1.125 million. Later that month, the Swiss house of representatives (Nationalrat) also agreed to increase police and military expenditures to CHF 39 million while the Kanton of [[Graubünden]] contributes CHF 2.25 million, the same amount the WEF is paying for security costs.<ref>[https://www.srf.ch/news/schweiz/abstimmungen/abstimmungen/abstimmungen-davos/davos-stimmt-ab-mehr-geld-fuer-das-wef Davos stimmt ab - Mehr Geld für das WEF](in German) SRF.ch.

===Private vs public meetings===
Since the annual meeting in January 2003 in Davos, an ''[[Open Forum Davos]]'',<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.openforumdavos.ch/ |title=Open Forum Davos, Schweizerischer Evangelischer Kirchenbund |publisher=Openforumdavos.ch |access-date=7 March 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100202022348/http://www.openforumdavos.ch/ |archive-date=2 February 2010 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> which was co-organized by the [[Swiss Reformed Church|Federation of Swiss Protestant Churches]], is held concurrently with the Davos forum, opening up the debate about globalization to the general public. The Open Forum has been held in the local high school every year, featuring top politicians and business leaders. It is open to all members of the public free of charge.<ref>Pigman. p. 130.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/view_play_list?p=78AB043A344C2C6A |title=Open Forum |publisher=YouTube |access-date=7 March 2010}}</ref>

==="Davos Man"===
"Davos Man" is a [[neologism]] referring to the global elite of wealthy (predominantly) men, whose members view themselves as completely "international". According to political scientist [[Samuel P. Huntington]], who is credited with inventing the phrase "Davos Man",<ref>Timothy Garton Ash. [https://www.theguardian.com/comment/story/0,,1404411,00.html Davos man's death wish]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080821094256/http://www.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0%2C%2C1404411%2C00.html |date=21 August 2008 }}, ''[[The Guardian]]'', 3 February 2005</ref> they are people who "have little need for national loyalty, view national boundaries as obstacles that thankfully are vanishing, and see national governments as residues from the past whose only useful function is to facilitate the élite's global operations". In his 2004 article "Dead Souls: The Denationalization of the American Elite", Huntington argues that this international perspective is a minority elitist position not shared by the nationalist majority of the people.<ref>Samuel Huntington. [http://nationalinterest.org/article/dead-souls-the-denationalization-of-the-american-elite-620 "Dead Souls: The Denationalization of the American Elite"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160914184047/http://nationalinterest.org/article/dead-souls-the-denationalization-of-the-american-elite-620 |date=14 September 2016 }}, ''[[The National Interest]]'', Spring 2004</ref>

In 2019, the ''[[Manager Magazin]]'' journalist Henrik Müller argued that the "Davos Man" had already decayed into different groups and camps. He sees three central drivers for this development:<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl=de&u=https://www.manager-magazin.de/politik/weltwirtschaft/wef-in-davos-weltwirtschaftsforum-und-seine-probleme-a-1248970.html&prev=search|title="Davos Man" and his successors|first=Henrik|last=Müller}}</ref>
* Ideologically: the liberal western model is no longer considered a universal role model that other countries strive for (with China's digital totalitarianism or the traditional absolutism in the Persian Gulf as counter-proposals, all of which are represented by government members in Davos).
* Socially: societies increasingly disintegrate into different groups, each of which evokes its own identity (e.g. embodied through the Brexit vote or congressional blockades in the USA).
* Economically: the measured economic reality largely contradicts the established ideas of how the economy should actually work (despite economic upswings, wages and prices e.g. barely rise).

===Gender debate===
{{see|gender bias}}
Since 2011, the World Economic Forum has been addressing its very own [[Women in government#Quotas|gender quota]], to introduce at least one woman for every five senior executives that attended. Female participation increased from 9% to 15% between 2001 and 2005. In 2016, 18% of the WEF attendees were female; this number increased to 21% in 2017, and 24% in 2020, five years of growth.<ref>A. Gibbs (2017). [https://www.cnbc.com/2017/01/16/as-world-leaders-descend-upon-wef-2017-in-davos-the-gender-debate-rumbles-on.html As world leaders descend upon Davos, the gender debate rumbles on] CNBC News.

Several women have since shared their personal impressions of the Davos meetings in media articles, highlighting that issues were more profound than "a quota at Davos for female leaders or a session on diversity and inclusion".<ref>BuzzFeedNews, Retrieved 19 May 2020.

===Undemocratic decision making===
According to the [[European Parliament]]'s [[Think Tank]], critics see the WEF as an instrument for political and business leaders to 'take decisions without having to account to their electorate or shareholders'.<ref>{{cite web| url = https://www.europarl.europa.eu/thinktank/en/document.html?reference=EPRS_BRI(2016)573928 | title = The World Economic Forum: Influential and controversial | publisher = European Parliament Think Tank | date= 19 January 2016 | access-date= 19 May 2020}}</ref>

=== Lack of financial transparency ===
{{see|financial transparency}}
In 2017, the former [[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung| FAZ-Journalist]] Jürgen Dunsch criticized that financial reports of the WEF were not very transparent since neither income nor expenditures were broken down. In addition, he outlined that the foundation capital was not quantified while the apparently not insignificant profits would be reinvested.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sueddeutsche.de/wirtschaft/davos-das-weltwirtschaftsforum-ist-zu-einer-geldmaschine-geworden-1.3334817|title=Weltwirtschaftsforum ist zu einer Geldmaschine geworden|first=Caspar|last=Busse|website=Süddeutsche.de}}</ref> Recent annual reports published by the WEF include a more detailed breakdown of its financials and indicate revenues of SFr 349 million for the year 2019 with reserves of SFr 310 million and a foundation capital of SFr 34 million. There are no further details provided to what asset classes or individual names the WEF allocates its financial assets of SFr 261 million.<ref>http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_Annual_Report_18-19.pdf</ref>

=== COVID-19 pandemic coverage ===
{{Globalize|section|date=May 2020}}
The WEF has a broad coverage of the [[COVID-19 pandemic]] by reflecting on scientific findings, government strategies as well as general pandemic and health advice.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.weforum.org/search/|title=Search|website=World Economic Forum}}</ref> Some articles published by the WEF at an early stage of the pandemic were written in a very favorable tone regarding the Chinese management of the health crisis. In March 2020, the WEF issued a text highlighting that "China has done an incredible job at slowing the spread of the virus" and that the WEF's Director for China was "impressed to see the delicate balancing act the Chinese government is doing between getting the economy growing again and protecting public health."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/03/chinas-response-shows-how-bold-decision-making-can-contain-coronavirus/|title=China's response shows how bold decision-making can contain coronavirus|website=World Economic Forum}}</ref> This was in contrast with criticism elsewhere of the Chinese government's COVID-19 information policy and data accuracy, which had been publicly flagged by a number of Western officials in February.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/14/coronavirus-china-not-being-honest-says-us-as-wartime-measures-widened|title=Coronavirus outbreak: senior US official accuses China of lack of transparency|date=14 February 2020|via=www.theguardian.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/02/15/coronavirus-xi-jinping-chinas-incompetence-endangered-the-world/|title=How China's Incompetence Endangered the World|first=Laurie|last=Garrett}}</ref>
