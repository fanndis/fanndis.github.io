The '''1968 United States presidential election'''  was the 46th quadrennial [[United States presidential election|presidential election]], held on Tuesday, November 5, 1968. The [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] nominee, former [[Vice President of the United States|vice president]] [[Richard Nixon]], defeated the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] nominee, incumbent vice president [[Hubert Humphrey]], and the [[American Independent Party]] nominee, Governor [[George Wallace]]. Analysts have argued the election of 1968 was a major [[realigning election]] as it permanently disrupted the [[New Deal coalition]] that had dominated presidential politics since [[1932 United States presidential election|1932]].

Incumbent president [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] had been the early front-runner for the Democratic Party's nomination, but withdrew from the race after narrowly winning the [[New Hampshire primary]]. [[Eugene McCarthy]], [[Robert F. Kennedy]], and Humphrey emerged as the three major candidates in [[1968 Democratic Party presidential primaries|the Democratic primaries]] until Kennedy [[Assassination of Robert F. Kennedy|was assassinated]]. Humphrey won the nomination, sparking numerous anti-war protests. Nixon entered [[1968 Republican Party presidential primaries|the Republican primaries]] as the front-runner, defeating [[Nelson Rockefeller]], [[Ronald Reagan]], and other candidates to win his party's nomination. Alabama governor [[George Wallace]] ran on the [[American Independent Party]] ticket, campaigning in favor of [[Racial segregation in the United States|racial segregation]].

The election year was tumultuous; it was marked by the [[assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.]] and [[King assassination riots|subsequent riots]] across the nation, the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy, and widespread [[Opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War|opposition to the Vietnam War]] across university campuses. Nixon ran on a campaign that promised to restore [[Law and order (politics)|law and order]] to the nation's cities and provide new leadership in the Vietnam War. A year later, he would popularize the term "[[silent majority]]" to describe those he viewed as being his target voters. He also pursued a "[[Southern strategy]]" designed to win conservative Southern white voters who had traditionally supported the Democrats. Humphrey promised to continue Johnson's [[war on poverty]] and to support the [[civil rights movement]]. Humphrey trailed significantly in polls taken in late August but narrowed Nixon's lead after Wallace's candidacy collapsed and Johnson suspended bombing in the Vietnam War.

Nixon won a plurality of the popular vote by a narrow margin, but won by a large margin in the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]], carrying most states outside of the [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]]. Wallace won five states in the [[Deep South]] and ran well in some [[ethnic enclave]] industrial districts in the North; he is the most recent [[third party (United States)|third party]] candidate to win a state.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.270towin.com/historical-presidential-elections/|title=Historical U.S. Presidential Elections 1789-2016|website=www.270towin.com|access-date=2019-02-01}}</ref> It was the first presidential election after the passage of the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]], which had led to mass enfranchisement of [[Race and ethnicity in the United States|racial minorities]] throughout the country, especially in the South.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.history.com/topics/black-history/voting-rights-act|title=Voting Rights Act of 1965|website=HISTORY|language=en|access-date=2019-02-01}}</ref> Nixon's victory marked the start of a period of Republican dominance in presidential elections, as Republicans won four of the next five elections.

==Historical background==
In the [[1964 United States presidential election|election of 1964]], incumbent [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[President of the United States|United States President]] [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] won the largest popular vote landslide in [[U.S. Presidential election]] history over [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[United States Senate|United States Senator]] [[Barry Goldwater]]. During the presidential term that followed, Johnson was able to achieve many political successes, including the passage of the [[Great Society]] domestic programs (including "War on Poverty" legislation), landmark [[civil rights]] legislation, and the continued exploration of space. Despite making significant achievements, his popular support would be short-lived. At the same time, the country endured large-scale race riots in the streets of its larger cities, along with a generational revolt of young people and violent debates over foreign policy. The emergence of the [[hippie]] [[Counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]], the rise of [[New Left]] activism, and the emergence of the [[Black Power]] movement exacerbated social and cultural clashes between classes, generations, and races. Adding to the national crisis, on April 4, 1968, [[Civil rights movement|civil rights leader]] Rev. [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], was [[Assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.|assassinated]] in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], igniting further mass rioting and chaos, including [[Washington, D.C.]], where there was rioting within just a few blocks of the White House and machine guns were stationed on the Capitol steps to protect it.<ref>Thomas Adams Upchurch, ''Race relations in the United States, 1960–1980'' (2008) pp. 7–50.</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/timeline-seismic-180967503/|title=A Timeline of 1968: The Year That Shattered America|website=Smithsonian|language=en|access-date=2019-02-01}}</ref>

The primary reason for the precipitous decline of President Lyndon B. Johnson's popularity was the [[Vietnam War]], which he greatly escalated during his time in office. By late 1967, over 500,000 American soldiers were fighting in Vietnam.  Draftees made up 42 percent of the military in Vietnam, but suffered 58% of the casualties as nearly 1000 Americans a month were killed and many more were injured.<ref>{{cite book|author=James Westheider|title=Fighting in Vietnam: The Experience of the US Soldier|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M9jS16CZh0YC&pg=PA136|year=2011|publisher=Stackpole Books|pages=136–38|isbn=978-0-8117-0831-9}}</ref> Johnson's position was particularly damaged when the national [[news media]] began to focus on the high costs and ambiguous results of escalation, despite his repeated efforts to downplay the seriousness of the situation.

In early January 1968, [[Secretary of Defense Employer Support Freedom Award|Secretary of Defense]] [[Robert McNamara]] stated that the war would be winding down as the North Vietnamese were losing their will to fight, but shortly thereafter, they launched the [[Tet Offensive]], in which they and Communist [[Vietcong]] forces launched simultaneous attacks on all government strongholds in South Vietnam. Though a U.S. military victory, Tet led many Americans to ponder whether the war was winnable or worth it. In addition, voters felt they could not trust their government's assessment and reporting of the war effort. The Pentagon called for sending several hundred thousand more soldiers to Vietnam. Johnson's approval ratings fell below 35%, and the [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] refused to let the president make public appearances on the campuses of American colleges and universities, due to his extreme unpopularity among college students. The Secret Service also prevented Johnson from appearing at the [[1968 Democratic National Convention protest activity|1968 Democratic National Convention]] in [[Chicago|Chicago, Illinois]], because it could not guarantee his safety from assassination.<ref>{{cite book|author=Ben J.

===Primaries===

[[File:NIXONcampaigns.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Richard Nixon campaign rally, July 1968]]
The [[front-runner]] for the Republican nomination was former [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Richard Nixon]], who formally began campaigning in January 1968.<ref name="N&O">{{cite news|title=Another Race To the Finish |newspaper=[[The News & Observer]] |date=November 2, 2008 |url=http://www.newsobserver.com/news/q/story/1278451.html |accessdate=November 24, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090115040630/http://www.newsobserver.com/news/q/story/1278451.html |archive-date=January 15, 2009 }}</ref> Nixon had worked tirelessly behind the scenes and was instrumental in Republican gains in Congress and governorships in the 1966 midterm elections. Thus, the party machinery and many of the new congressmen and governors supported him. Still, there was wariness in the Republican ranks over Nixon, who had lost the 1960 election and then lost the 1962 California gubernatorial election. Some hoped a more "electable" candidate would emerge. To a great extent the story of the 1968 Republican primary campaign and nomination is the story of one Nixon opponent after another entering the race and then dropping out. Nixon was always clearly the front runner throughout the contest because of his superior organization, and he easily defeated the rest of the field.

Nixon's first challenger was [[List of governors of Michigan|Michigan Governor]] [[George W. Romney]]. A Gallup poll in mid-1967 showed Nixon with 39%, followed by Romney with 25%. However, Romney, after a fact finding trip to Vietnam, told Detroit talk show host [[Lou Gordon (journalist)|Lou Gordon]] that he had been "brainwashed" by the military and the [[diplomatic corps]] into supporting the Vietnam War; the remark led to weeks of ridicule in the national [[news media]]. Since he had turned against American involvement in Vietnam, Romney planned to run as the anti-war Republican version of Eugene McCarthy.<ref>''The New York Times'', February 18, 1968</ref> However, following his "brainwashing" comment, Romney's support faded steadily, and with polls showing him far behind Nixon he withdrew from the race on February 28, 1968.<ref>''The New York Times'', February 29, 1968</ref>

[[United States Senate|United States Senator]] [[Charles H. Percy|Charles Percy]] was considered another potential threat to Nixon even before Romney's withdrawal, and had planned on potentially waging an active campaign after securing a role as Illinois's [[favorite son]]. Later however, Percy declined to have his name presented on the ballot for the Illinois presidential primary, and while he never disclaimed his interest in the presidential nomination, he no longer actively sought it either.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1967/09/26/archives/percy-shunning-active-68-role-wants-to-stay-off-ballot-in.html |title=PERCY SHUNNING ACTIVE '68 ROLE – Wants to Stay Off Ballot in Presidential Primaries  |accessdate=August 25, 2015|newspaper=The New York Times |date=1967-09-26 }}</ref>

Nixon won a resounding victory in the important New Hampshire primary on March 12, with 78% of the vote. Anti-war Republicans wrote in the name of [[Governor of New York|New York Governor]] [[Nelson Rockefeller]], the leader of the Republican Party's liberal wing, who received 11% of the vote and became Nixon's new challenger. Rockefeller had originally not intended to run, having discounted a campaign for the nomination in 1965 and planned on making [[United States Senate|United States Senator]] [[Jacob K. Javits|Jacob Javits]] the [[favorite son]], either in preparation of a presidential campaign or to secure him the second spot on the ticket; as Rockefeller warmed to the idea of entering the race again however, Javits moved his attentions back towards seeking a third term in the Senate.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1967/09/29/archives/javits-says-favoriteson-choice-for-68-is-still-an-open-matter.html |title=Javits Says Favorite-Son Choice For '68 Is Still an Open Matter  |date=September 29, 1967 |accessdate=August 25, 2015}}</ref> Nixon led Rockefeller in the polls throughout the primary campaign, and though Rockefeller defeated Nixon and [[Governor of Massachusetts|Governor]] [[John A. Volpe|John Volpe]] from [[Massachusetts]] primary on April 30, he otherwise fared poorly in state primaries and conventions, having declared too late to place his name on state ballots.

By early spring, [[Governor of California|California Governor]] [[Ronald Reagan]], the leader of the Republican Party's conservative wing, had become Nixon's chief rival. In the Nebraska primary on May 14, Nixon won with 70% of the vote to 21% for Reagan and 5% for Rockefeller. While this was a wide margin for Nixon, Reagan remained Nixon's leading challenger. Nixon won the next primary of importance, Oregon, on May 15 with 65% of the vote, and won all the following primaries except for California (June 4), where only Reagan appeared on the ballot. Reagan's victory in California gave him a plurality of the nationwide primary vote, but his poor showing in most other state primaries left him far behind Nixon in the actual delegate count.

===Republican Convention===
{{Main|1968 Republican National Convention}}
{{See also|1968 Miami riot}}
As the [[1968 Republican National Convention]] opened in [[Miami Beach, Florida]], the [[Associated Press]] estimated that Nixon had 656 delegate votes – only 11 short of the number he needed to win the nomination. His only remaining obstacles were Reagan and Rockefeller, who were planning to unite their forces in a "stop-Nixon" movement.

Because Goldwater had done well in the [[Deep South]], delegates to the [[1968 Republican National Convention]] would be more Southern and conservative than past conventions. There was a real possibility that the conservative Reagan would be nominated if there was no victor on the first ballot. Nixon narrowly secured the nomination on the first ballot, with the aid of South Carolina [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Strom Thurmond]], who had switched parties in 1964.{{sfn|Perlstein|2008}}{{page needed|date=March 2013}} He selected [[dark horse]] Maryland Governor [[Spiro Agnew]] as his running mate, a choice which Nixon believed would unite the party, appealing to both Northern moderates and Southerners disaffected with the Democrats.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.upi.com/Audio/Year_in_Review/Events-of-1968/1968-Presidential-Election/12303153093431-2/ | title=1968 Year In Review | publisher=UPI | accessdate=June 17, 2010}}</ref> It was also reported that Nixon's first choice for running mate was his longtime friend and ally  [[Robert Finch (American politician)|Robert Finch]], who was the [[Lieutenant Governor of California]] at the time. Finch declined that offer,  but would later serve as the [[United States Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare|Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare]] in Nixon's Administration. With Vietnam also a key issue, Nixon strongly considered tapping his 1960 running mate, [[Henry Cabot Lodge Jr.]], who was a former U.S. senator, ambassador to the UN, and ambassador twice to [[South Vietnam]].

===Enter Eugene McCarthy===

Because Lyndon B. Johnson had been elected to the presidency only once, in 1964, and had served less than two full years of the term before that, the [[22nd Amendment]] did not disqualify him from running for another term.<ref>{{cite news|title=Johnson Can Seek Two Full Terms|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=November 24, 1963|page=A2}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Law Permits 2 Full Terms for Johnson|first=William|last=Moore|newspaper=The Chicago Tribune|date=November 24, 1963|page=7}}</ref> As a result, it was widely assumed when 1968 began that President Johnson would run for another term, and that he would have little trouble winning the Democratic nomination.

Despite growing opposition to Johnson's policies in Vietnam, it appeared that no prominent Democratic candidate would run against a sitting president of his own party.  It was also accepted at the beginning of the year that Johnson's record of domestic accomplishments would overshadow public opposition to the Vietnam War and that he would easily boost his public image after he started campaigning.<ref name=johnman1967>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,712057,00.html|title=Man Of The Year: Lyndon B. Johnson, The Paradox of Power|magazine=Time Magazine|date=January 5, 1968|accessdate=June 22, 2013}}</ref>  Even [[United States Senate|United States Senator]] [[Robert F. Kennedy]] from [[New York (state)|New York]], an outspoken critic of Johnson's policies with a large base of support, publicly declined to run against Johnson in the primaries.  Poll numbers also suggested that a large share of Americans who opposed the Vietnam War felt the growth of the anti-war [[hippie movement]] among younger Americans was not helping their cause.<ref name=johnman1967 />  On January 30, however, claims by the Johnson administration that a recent troop surge would soon bring an end to the war were severely discredited when the [[Tet Offensive]] broke out. Although the American military was eventually able to fend off the attacks, and also inflict heavy losses among the communist opposition, the ability of the North Vietnamese Army and Viet Cong to launch large scale attacks during the Tet Offensive's long duration greatly weakened American support for the military draft and further combat operations in Vietnam.<ref name=tetl>{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/tet-offensive-shakes-cold-war-confidence|title=Jan 30, 1968: Tet Offensive shakes Cold War confidence|publisher =History.com:This Day In History|accessdate=June 22, 2013}}</ref> A recorded phone conversation which Johnson had with [[Mayor of Chicago|Chicago mayor]] [[Richard J. Daley]] on January 27 revealed that both men had become aware of Kennedy's private intention to enter the Democratic presidential primaries and that Johnson was willing to accept Daley's offer to run as Humphrey's vice president if he were to end his re-election campaign.<ref name=jan27 /> Daley, whose city would host the [[1968 Democratic National Convention protest activity|1968 Democratic National Convention]], also preferred either Johnson or Humphrey over any other candidate and stated that Kennedy had met him the week before, and that he was unsuccessful in his attempt to win over Daley's support.<ref name=jan27>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tc0wT9P7nc&t=367s</ref>

In time, only [[United States Senate|United States Senator]] [[Eugene McCarthy]] from [[Minnesota]] proved willing to challenge Johnson openly. Running as an anti-war candidate in the [[New Hampshire primary]], McCarthy hoped to pressure the Democrats into publicly opposing the Vietnam War. Since New Hampshire was the first presidential primary of 1968, McCarthy poured most of his limited resources into the state. He was boosted by thousands of young college students led by youth coordinator [[Sam Brown (activist)|Sam Brown]],<ref>[https://archive.is/20120714020341/http://openvault.wgbh.org/catalog/org.wgbh.mla:df96b4fbdd72ece621c2511b70c51217025f3845 Sam Brown discussing his involvement in the "Clean for Gene" campaign.] WGBH Open Vault. Retrieved July 20, 2010.</ref> who shaved their beards and cut their hair to be "Clean for Gene". These students organized get-out-the-vote drives, rang doorbells, distributed McCarthy buttons and leaflets, and worked hard in New Hampshire for McCarthy. On March 12, McCarthy won 42 percent of the primary vote to Johnson's 49 percent, a shockingly strong showing against an incumbent president, which was even more impressive because Johnson had more than 24 supporters running for the Democratic National Convention delegate slots to be filled in the election, while McCarthy's campaign organized more strategically, McCarthy won 20 of the 24 delegates. This gave McCarthy's campaign legitimacy and momentum.

Sensing Johnson's vulnerability, Senator Robert F. Kennedy announced his candidacy four days after the New Hampshire primary. Thereafter, McCarthy and Kennedy engaged in a series of state primaries. Despite Kennedy's high profile, McCarthy won most of the early primaries, including Kennedy's [[Massachusetts|native state of Massachusetts]] and some primaries in which he and Kennedy were in direct competition.<ref name="Rising1997">{{cite book|author=George Rising|title=Clean for Gene: Eugene McCarthy's 1968 Presidential Campaign|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RiO3P6SVttYC&pg=PA122|year=1997|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-275-95841-1|pages=122–}}</ref><ref>https://potus-geeks.livejournal.com/955258.html</ref> Following his victory in the key battleground state of [[Oregon]], it was assumed that McCarthy was the preferred choice among the young voters.<ref>https://www.oregonlive.com/history/2016/05/robert_kennedy_eugene_mccarthy.html</ref>

==={{anchor|Johnson withdraws}}Johnson withdraws===

On March 31, 1968, following the New Hampshire primary and Kennedy's entry into the election, the president announced to the nation in a televised speech that he was suspending all bombing of North Vietnam in favor of peace talks. Johnson concluded his speech and startled the nation by announcing "With America's sons in the fields far away, with America's future under challenge right here at home, with our hopes and the world's hopes for peace in the balance every day, I do not believe that I should devote an hour or a day of my time to any personal partisan causes or to any duties other than the awesome duties of this office—the presidency of your country. Accordingly, [[Shermanesque statement|I shall not seek, and I will not accept, the nomination of my party for another term as your President]]." Not discussed publicly at the time was Johnson's concern he might not survive another term—Johnson's health was poor, and he had suffered a serious [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] in 1955 while serving in the U.S. Senate. Indeed, he died on January 22, 1973, only two days after the new presidential term concluded. Bleak political forecasts also contributed to Johnson's withdrawal; internal polling by Johnson's campaign in Wisconsin, the next state to hold a primary election, showed the President trailing badly.<ref>https://time.com/5682760/incumbent-presidents-primary-challenges/</ref>

Johnson]], and General [[Creighton Abrams]] in a [[Cabinet Room (White House)|Cabinet Room]] meeting in March 1968]]
Historians have debated just why Johnson quit a few days after his weak showing in New Hampshire. [[Jeff Shesol]] says Johnson wanted out of the White House but also wanted vindication; when the indicators turned negative he decided to leave.<ref>{{cite book|author=Jeff Shesol|title=Mutual Contempt: Lyndon Johnson, Robert Kennedy, and the Feud that Defined a Decade|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bVrRvYV7i78C&pg=PA545|year=1998|publisher=W W Norton |pages=545–47|isbn=978-0-393-31855-5}}</ref> Lewis L. Gould maintains that Johnson had neglected the party, was hurting it by his Vietnam policies, and underestimated McCarthy's strength until the last minute, when it was too late for Johnson to recover.<ref>{{cite book|author=Lewis L. Gould|title=1968: The Election That Changed America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0yPdDZsjjJ4C&pg=PA16|year=2010|publisher=Government Institutes|pages=16–18|isbn=978-1-56663-910-1}}</ref> Randall Bennett Woods said Johnson realized he needed to leave in order for the nation to heal.<ref>{{cite book|author=Randall Bennett Woods|title=LBJ: architect of American ambition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Sb8W_Ba3jkkC&pg=PA834|year=2007|publisher=Harvard University Press|pages=834–35|isbn=978-0-674-02699-5}}</ref>  [[Robert Dallek]] writes that Johnson had no further domestic goals, and realized that his personality had eroded his popularity.  His health was not good, and he was preoccupied with the Kennedy campaign; his wife was pressing for his retirement and his base of support continued to shrink.  Leaving the race would allow him to pose as a peacemaker.<ref>{{cite book|author=Robert Dallek|title=Flawed Giant:Lyndon Johnson and His Times, 1961–1973|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G_J3PEegwdYC&pg=PA524|year=1998|publisher=Oxford University Press|pages=518–25|isbn=978-0-19-982670-4}}</ref>  Anthony J. Bennett, however, claims Johnson "had been forced out of a re-election race in 1968 by outrage over his policy in Southeast Asia".<ref>{{cite book|author=Anthony J. Bennett|title=The Race for the White House from Reagan to Clinton: Reforming Old Systems, Building New Coalitions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XH4Os4Cjr-cC&pg=PT160|year=2013|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|page=160|isbn=978-1-137-26860-0}}</ref>

It has also been reported that Johnson decided to wind down his re-election bid after popular and influential CBS News anchor [[Walter Cronkite]] turned against the president's policy in Vietnam and recommended peace negotiations during a CBS News editorial which aired on February 27.<ref name="Moore">{{cite news

With Johnson's withdrawal, the Democratic Party quickly split into four factions.
* The first faction consisted of labor unions and big-city party bosses (led by Mayor [[Richard J. Daley]]). This group had traditionally controlled the Democratic Party since the days of President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], and they feared loss of their control over the party. After Johnson's withdrawal this group rallied to support Hubert Humphrey, Johnson's vice-president; it was also believed that President Johnson himself was covertly supporting Humphrey, despite his public claims of neutrality.
* The second faction, which rallied behind Senator Eugene McCarthy, was composed of college students, intellectuals, and upper-middle-class whites who had been the early activists against the war in Vietnam; they perceived themselves as the future of the Democratic Party.
* The third group was primarily composed of Catholics, blacks and other minorities as well as several anti-war groups; these groups rallied behind Senator Robert F. Kennedy.
* The fourth group consisted of white Southern Democrats. Some older men, remembering the [[New Deal]]'s positive impact upon the rural South, supported Vice-President Humphrey. Many would rally behind the third-party campaign of former Alabama Governor [[George Wallace]] as a "law and order" candidate.

Since the Vietnam War had become the major issue that was dividing the Democratic Party, and Johnson had come to symbolize the war for many liberal Democrats, Johnson believed that he could not win the nomination without a major struggle, and that he would probably lose the election in November to the Republicans. However, by withdrawing from the race he could avoid the stigma of defeat, and he could keep control of the party machinery by giving the nomination to Humphrey, who had been a loyal vice-president.<ref>Dallek (1998); Woods (2006); Gould (1993).</ref>  Milne (2011) argues that, in terms of foreign-policy in the Vietnam War, Johnson at the end wanted Nixon to be president rather than Humphrey, since Johnson agreed with Nixon, rather than Humphrey, on the need to defend South Vietnam from communism.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = David | year = 1968 | title = Paris peace negotiations: a two level game? | journal = Review of International Studies | volume = 37 | issue = 2| pages = 577–599 }}</ref> However, Johnson's telephone calls show that Johnson believed the Nixon camp was deliberately sabotaging the [[Paris Peace Accords|Paris peace talks]]. He told Humphrey, who refused to use allegations based on illegal wiretaps of a presidential candidate. Nixon himself called Johnson and denied the allegations. Dallek concludes that Nixon's advice to Saigon made no difference, and that Humphrey was so closely identified with Johnson's unpopular policies that no last-minute deal with Hanoi could have affected the election.<ref>Robert Dallek, ''Nixon and Kissinger'' (2009) p 77</ref>

===Contest===

[[File:1968DemocraticPresidentialPrimaries.png|thumb|400px|Statewide contest by winner: Red = Kennedy, Orange = Smathers, Yellow = Young, Green = Johnson, Blue = McCarthy, Grey = No primary]]
After Johnson's withdrawal, [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] Hubert Humphrey announced his candidacy. Kennedy was successful in four state primaries (Indiana, Nebraska, South Dakota, and California) and McCarthy won six (Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, Oregon, New Jersey, and Illinois). However, in primaries where they campaigned directly against one another, Kennedy won three primaries (Indiana, Nebraska, and California) and McCarthy won one (Oregon).<ref>{{cite book |last= Cook |first= Rhodes |title=United States Presidential Primary Elections 1968–1996: A Handbook of Election Statistics |publisher=CQ Press |year=2000 |location= Washington, D.C. |pages=12–13 |isbn= 978-1-56802-451-6}}</ref> Humphrey did not compete in the primaries, leaving that job to [[favorite son]]s who were his surrogates, notably [[United States Senate|United States Senator]] [[George A. Smathers]] from [[Florida]], [[United States Senate|United States Senator]] [[Stephen M. Young]] from [[Ohio]], and [[Governor of Indiana|Governor]] [[Roger D. Branigin]] of [[Indiana]]. Instead, Humphrey concentrated on winning the delegates in non-primary states, where party leaders such as [[Mayor of Chicago|Chicago Mayor]] [[Richard J. Daley]] controlled the delegate votes in their states. Kennedy defeated Branigin and McCarthy in the Indiana primary, and then defeated McCarthy in the Nebraska primary. However, McCarthy upset Kennedy in the Oregon primary.

After Kennedy's defeat in Oregon, the California primary was seen as crucial to both Kennedy and McCarthy. McCarthy stumped the state's many colleges and universities, where he was treated as a hero for being the first presidential candidate to oppose the war. Kennedy campaigned in the [[ghetto]]s and [[barrio]]s of the state's larger cities, where he was mobbed by enthusiastic supporters. Kennedy and McCarthy engaged in a television debate a few days before the primary; it was generally considered a draw. On June 4, Kennedy narrowly defeated McCarthy in California, 46%–42%. However, McCarthy refused to withdraw from the race and made it clear that he would contest Kennedy in the upcoming New York primary, where McCarthy had much support from anti-war activists in New York City. The New York primary quickly became a moot point, however, for [[Assassination of Robert F. Kennedy|Kennedy was assassinated]]  shortly after midnight on June 5; he died twenty-six hours later at [[Good Samaritan Hospital (Los Angeles)|Good Samaritan Hospital]]. Kennedy had just given his victory speech in a crowded ballroom of the [[Ambassador Hotel (Los Angeles)|Ambassador Hotel]] in Los Angeles; he and his aides then entered a narrow kitchen pantry on their way to a banquet room to meet with reporters. In the pantry Kennedy and five others were shot by [[Sirhan Sirhan]], a 24-year-old [[Rosicrucian]] [[Palestinians|Palestinian]] of [[Palestinian Christian|Christian background]] and [[Jordan]]ian citizenship, who hated Kennedy because of his support for Israel. Sirhan admitted his guilt, was convicted of murder, and is still in prison.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Abbe A. Debolt|author2=James S.

Political historians still debate whether Kennedy could have won the Democratic nomination had he lived. Some historians, such as [[Theodore H. White]] and [[Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr.]], have argued that Kennedy's broad appeal and famed [[charisma]] would have convinced the party bosses at the Democratic Convention to give him the nomination. Jack Newfield, author of ''RFK: A Memoir'', stated in a 1998 interview that on the night he was assassinated, "[Kennedy] had a phone conversation with Mayor Daley of Chicago, and Mayor Daley all but promised to throw the Illinois delegates to Bobby at the convention in August 1968. I think he said to me, and [[Pete Hamill]], 'Daley is the ball game, and I think we have Daley.{{'"}}<ref>Jack Newfield, interview with Terry Gross, ''[[Fresh Air]] from WHYY'', National Public Radio, WHYY, Philadelphia, June 4, 1998. [https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=91151292 Excerpt] rebroadcast on June 4, 2008.</ref> However, other writers such as [[Tom Wicker]], who covered the Kennedy campaign for ''[[The New York Times]]'', believe that Humphrey's large lead in delegate votes from non-primary states, combined with Senator McCarthy's refusal to quit the race, would have prevented Kennedy from ever winning a majority at the Democratic Convention, and that Humphrey would have been the Democratic nominee even if Kennedy had lived. The journalist [[Richard Reeves (American writer)|Richard Reeves]] and historian [[Michael Beschloss]] have both written that Humphrey was the likely nominee, and future Democratic National Committee chairman [[Larry O'Brien]] wrote in his memoirs that Kennedy's chances of winning the nomination had been slim, even after his win in California.

At the moment of RFK's death, the delegate totals were:
*[[Hubert Humphrey]] 561
*[[Robert F. Kennedy]] 393
*[[Eugene McCarthy]] 258

===Democratic Convention and antiwar protests===

Robert Kennedy's death altered the dynamics of the race. Although Humphrey appeared the presumptive favorite for the nomination, thanks to his support from the traditional power blocs of the party, he was an unpopular choice with many of the [[antiwar|anti-war]] elements within the party, who identified him with Johnson's controversial position on the Vietnam War. However, Kennedy's delegates failed to unite behind a single candidate who could have prevented Humphrey from getting the nomination. Some of Kennedy's support went to McCarthy, but many of Kennedy's delegates, remembering their bitter primary battles with McCarthy, refused to vote for him. Instead, these delegates rallied around the late-starting candidacy of Senator [[George McGovern]] of South Dakota, a Kennedy supporter in the spring primaries who had presidential ambitions himself. This division of the anti-war votes at the Democratic Convention made it easier for Humphrey to gather the delegates he needed to win the nomination.

When the [[1968 Democratic National Convention]] opened in Chicago, thousands of young activists from around the nation gathered in the city to [[1968 Democratic National Convention protest activity|protest the Vietnam War]]. On the evening of August 28, in a clash which was covered on live television, Americans were shocked to see Chicago police brutally beating anti-war protesters in the streets of Chicago in front of the Conrad Hilton Hotel. While the protesters chanted "[[the whole world is watching]]", the police used clubs and [[tear gas]] to beat back or arrest the protesters, leaving many of them bloody and dazed. The tear gas wafted into numerous hotel suites; in one of them Vice President Humphrey was watching the proceedings on television. The police said that their actions were justified because numerous police officers were being injured by bottles, rocks, and broken glass that were being thrown at them by the protestors. The protestors had also yelled insults at the police, calling them "pigs" and other [[epithets]]. The anti-war and police riot divided the Democratic Party's base: some supported the protestors and felt that the police were being heavy-handed, but others disapproved of the violence and supported the police. Meanwhile, the convention itself was marred by the strong-arm tactics of Chicago's mayor Richard J. Daley (who was seen on television angrily cursing Senator [[Abraham Ribicoff]] from Connecticut, who made a speech at the convention denouncing the excesses of the Chicago police). In the end, the nomination itself was anti-climactic, with Vice-President Humphrey handily beating McCarthy and McGovern on the first ballot.

After the delegates nominated Humphrey, the convention then turned to selecting a vice-presidential nominee. The main candidates for this position were Senators [[Edward M. Kennedy]] from Massachusetts, [[Edmund Muskie]] from Maine, and [[Fred R. Harris]] from Oklahoma; Governors [[Richard J. Hughes|Richard Hughes]] of New Jersey and [[Terry Sanford]] of North Carolina; Mayor [[Joseph Alioto]] of San Francisco, California; former Deputy Secretary of Defense [[Cyrus Vance]]; and Ambassador [[Sargent Shriver]] from Maryland. Another idea floated was to tap Republican Governor [[Nelson Rockefeller]] of New York, one of the most liberal Republicans.  Ted Kennedy was Humphrey's first choice, but the senator turned him down. After narrowing it down to Senator Muskie and Senator Harris, Vice-President Humphrey chose Muskie, a moderate and [[environmentalist]] from [[Maine]], for the nomination. The convention complied with the request and nominated Senator Muskie as Humphrey's running mate.

The publicity from the anti-war riots crippled Humphrey's campaign from the start, and it never fully recovered.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=58481 |title=White, pp. 377–378 |publisher=Ourcampaigns.com |accessdate=June 17, 2010}}</ref> Before 1968 the city of Chicago had been a frequent host for the political conventions of both parties; since 1968 only one national convention has been held there (the [[1996 Democratic National Convention|Democratic convention of 1996]], which nominated [[Bill Clinton]] for a second term).

The [[American Independent Party]], which was established in 1967 by [[Bill Shearer|Bill]] and Eileen Shearer, nominated former Alabama Governor [[George Wallace]] – whose pro-[[racial segregation]] policies had been rejected by the mainstream of the Democratic Party – as the party's candidate for president. The impact of the Wallace campaign was substantial, winning the electoral votes of several states in the [[Deep South]]. He appeared on the ballot in all fifty states, but not the District of Columbia. Although he did not come close to winning any states outside the South, Wallace was the most popular 1968 presidential candidate among young men.<ref name="'70s">{{cite book|title= How We Got Here: The '70s|last= Frum|first= David|author-link= David Frum|year= 2000|publisher= Basic Books|location= New York|isbn= 978-0-465-04195-4|page= xxi|url= https://archive.org/details/howwegothere70sd00frum}}</ref> Wallace also proved to be popular among [[blue-collar]] workers in the North and Midwest, and he took many votes which might have gone to Humphrey.<ref>{{cite book|author1=B. Dan Wood|author2=Soren Jordan|title=Party Polarization in America: The War Over Two Social Contracts|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=diAzDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA165|year=2017|page=165|isbn=9781108171212}}</ref>

Wallace was not expected to win the election – his strategy was to prevent either major party candidate from winning a preliminary majority in the [[U.S. Electoral College|Electoral College]]. Although Wallace put considerable effort into mounting a serious general election campaign, his presidential bid was also a continuation of Southern efforts to elect [[unpledged electors]] that had taken place in every election from [[1956 United States presidential election|1956]] - he had his electors promise to vote not necessarily for him but rather for whomever he directed them to support – his objective was not to move the election into the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] where he would have had little influence, but rather to give himself the bargaining power to determine the winner. Wallace's [[running mate]] was retired four star General [[Curtis LeMay]].

Prior to deciding on LeMay, Wallace gave serious consideration to former U.S. senator, governor, and Baseball Commissioner A.B. [[Happy Chandler]] of Kentucky as his running mate.<ref>{{cite journal|title=A. B. "Happy" Chandler, George C. Wallace, and the Presidential Election of 1968 |date=December 16, 2002 |doi=10.1111/1540-6563.00010 |volume=64 |issue=34 |journal=The Historian |pages=667–685|last1=Hill |first1=John Paul |s2cid=145329893 }}</ref> Chandler and Wallace met a number of times; however, Chandler said that he and Wallace were unable to come to an agreement regarding their positions on racial matters. Paradoxically, Chandler supported the segregationist [[Dixiecrat]]s in the 1948 presidential elections. However, after being reelected [[Governor of Kentucky]] in 1955, he used [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]] troops to enforce school integration.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/105414/Happy-Chandler |title=Happy Chandler &#124; biography – American politician and baseball commissioner |encyclopedia=Britannica.com |date=June 15, 1991 |accessdate=August 25, 2015}}</ref>

LeMay embarrassed Wallace's campaign in the fall by suggesting that [[nuclear weapons]] could be used in Vietnam.

===Other parties and candidates===
Also on the ballot in two or more states were black activist [[Eldridge Cleaver]] (who was ineligible to take office, as he would have only been 33 years of age on January 20, 1969) for the [[Peace and Freedom Party (United States)|Peace and Freedom Party]]; [[Henning A. Blomen|Henning Blomen]] for the [[Socialist Labor Party of America|Socialist Labor Party]]; [[Fred Halstead]] for the [[Socialist Workers Party (United States)|Socialist Workers Party]]; [[E. Harold Munn]] for the [[Prohibition Party]]; and [[Charlene Mitchell]] – the first African-American woman to run for president, and the first woman to receive valid votes in a general election – for the [[Communist Party USA|Communist Party]]. Comedians [[Dick Gregory]] and [[Pat Paulsen]] were notable [[write-in candidate]]s. A facetious presidential candidate for 1968 was a pig named [[Pigasus (politics)|Pigasus]], as a political statement by the [[Yippies]], to illustrate their premise that "one pig's as good as any other."<ref name="Perlstein">{{cite book|first=Rick| last=Perlstein|title=Nixonland: The Rise of a President and the Fracturing of America|year=2008| title-link=Nixonland: The Rise of a President and the Fracturing of America}}</ref>{{page needed|date=March 2013}}

==General election==

===Campaign strategies===
Nixon developed a "[[Southern strategy]]" that was designed to appeal to conservative white southerners, who traditionally voted Democratic, but were opposed to Johnson and Humphrey's support for the [[Civil and political rights|civil rights]] movement, as well as the rioting that had broken out in the ghettos of most large cities. Wallace, however, won over many of the voters Nixon targeted, effectively splitting the conservative vote. Indeed, Wallace deliberately targeted many states he had little chance of carrying himself in the hope that by splitting the conservative vote with Nixon he would give those states to Humphrey and, by extension, boost his own chances of denying both opponents an Electoral College majority.<ref>Joseph A. Aistrup, ''The southern strategy revisited: Republican top-down advancement in the South'' (2015).</ref>

Since he was well behind Nixon in the polls as the campaign began, Humphrey opted for a slashing, fighting campaign style. He repeatedly – and unsuccessfully – challenged Nixon to a televised debate, and he often compared his campaign to the successful underdog effort of President [[Harry Truman]], another Democrat who had trailed in the polls, in the 1948 presidential election. Humphrey predicted that he, like Truman, would surprise the experts and win an upset victory.<ref>{{cite book|author=Daniel S. Margolies|title=A Companion to Harry S.

Nixon campaigned on a theme to restore "[[Law and order (politics)|law and order]],"<ref name="hnn greenberg">{{cite news |title= Civil Rights: Let 'Em Wiretap!|last= Greenberg|first= David|author-link= David Greenberg (historian)|date=October 22, 2001|publisher= History News Network|url= http://hnn.us/articles/366.html}}</ref> which appealed to many voters angry with the hundreds of violent riots that had taken place across the country in the previous few years. Following the murder of [[Martin Luther King Jr.|Martin Luther King]] in April 1968, there was [[King-assassination riots|massive rioting in inner city areas]]. The police were overwhelmed and President Johnson had to call out the U.S. Army. Nixon also opposed [[Desegregation busing|forced busing to desegregate schools]].<ref name="'70s 265">{{cite book|title= How We Got Here: The '70s|last= Frum|first= David|author-link= David Frum|year= 2000|publisher= Basic Books|location= New York, New York|isbn= 978-0-465-04195-4|page= [https://archive.org/details/howwegothere70sd00frum/page/265 265]|url= https://archive.org/details/howwegothere70sd00frum/page/265}}</ref> Proclaiming himself a supporter of civil rights, he recommended education as the solution rather than militancy. During the campaign, Nixon proposed government tax incentives to African Americans for small businesses and home improvements in their existing neighborhoods.<ref>Conrad Black, (2007), p. 525.</ref>

During the campaign, Nixon also used as a theme his opposition to the decisions of Chief Justice [[Earl Warren]]. Many conservatives were critical of Chief Justice Warren for using the Supreme Court to promote liberal policies in the fields of [[civil rights]], [[civil liberties]], and the [[separation of church and state]]. Nixon promised that if he were elected president, he would appoint justices who would take a less-active role in creating social policy.<ref name="abe fortas">{{cite book| title = Abe Fortas | author = Laura Kalman| publisher = [[Yale University Press]]| year = 1990 | url = https://archive.org/details/abefortasbiograp00kalm | url-access = registration | accessdate = October 20, 2008 | isbn = 978-0-300-04669-4 }}</ref> In another campaign promise, he pledged to end the [[Conscription in the United States|draft]].<ref name="evans">{{cite web | url=http://www.shsu.edu/~his_ncp/VolArm.html | title=The All-Volunteer Army After Twenty Years: Recruiting in the Modern Era | author=Thomas W.

Humphrey, meanwhile, promised to continue and expand the [[Great Society]] welfare programs started by President Johnson, and to continue the Johnson Administration's "[[War on poverty|War on Poverty]]." He also promised to continue the efforts of Presidents Kennedy and Johnson, and the Supreme Court, in promoting the expansion of civil rights and civil liberties for minority groups. However, Humphrey also felt constrained for most of his campaign in voicing any opposition to the Vietnam War policies of President Johnson, due to his fear that Johnson would reject any peace proposals he made and undermine his campaign. As a result, early in his campaign Humphrey often found himself the target of anti-war protestors, some of whom heckled and disrupted his campaign rallies.

===Humphrey's comeback and the October surprise===
After the Democratic Convention in late August, Humphrey trailed Nixon by double digits in most [[Historical polling for U.S. Presidential elections#1968 United States presidential election|polls]], and his chances seemed hopeless. Many within Humphrey's campaign saw their real goal as avoiding the potential humiliation of finishing behind Wallace in the electoral college vote (if not necessarily the popular vote), rather than having any serious chance of defeating Nixon. According to ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine, "The old Democratic coalition was disintegrating, with untold numbers of blue-collar workers responding to Wallace's blandishments, Negroes threatening to sit out the election, liberals disaffected over the Vietnam War, the South lost. The war chest was almost empty, and the party's machinery, neglected by Lyndon Johnson, creaked in disrepair."<ref>''Time'' November 15, 1968</ref> Calling for "the politics of joy," and using the still-powerful [[Trade union|labor unions]] as his base, Humphrey fought back. In order to distance himself from Johnson and to take advantage of the Democratic plurality in voter registration, Humphrey stopped being identified in ads as "Vice-President Hubert Humphrey," instead being labelled "Democratic candidate Hubert Humphrey." Humphrey attacked Wallace as a racist bigot who appealed to the darker impulses of Americans. Wallace had been rising in the polls, and peaked at 21% in September, but his momentum stopped after he selected [[Curtis LeMay]] as his running mate. Curtis LeMay's suggestion of tactical nuclear weapons being used in Vietnam conjured up memories of the [[Barry Goldwater presidential campaign, 1964|1964 Goldwater campaign]].{{sfn|Perlstein|2008}} Labor unions also undertook a major effort to win back union members who were supporting Wallace, with substantial success. Polls that showed Wallace winning almost one-half of union members in the summer of 1968 showed a sharp decline in his union support as the campaign progressed. As election day approached and Wallace's support in the North and Midwest began to wane, Humphrey finally began to climb in the polls.

In October, Humphrey—who was rising sharply in the polls due to the collapse of the Wallace vote—began to distance himself publicly from the Johnson administration on the Vietnam War, calling for a bombing halt. The key turning point for Humphrey's campaign came when President Johnson officially announced a bombing halt, and even a possible peace deal, the weekend before the election. The "Halloween Peace" gave Humphrey's campaign a badly needed boost. In addition, Senator Eugene McCarthy finally endorsed Humphrey in late October after previously refusing to do so, and by election day the polls were reporting a dead heat.<ref>Theodore H. White, ''The Making of the President, 1968'' (1970)</ref>

===Nixon campaign sabotage of peace talks===
The Nixon campaign had anticipated a possible "[[October surprise]]," a peace agreement produced by the Paris negotiations; as such an agreement would be a boost to Humphrey, Nixon thwarted any last-minute chances of a "Halloween Peace." Nixon told campaign aide and his future [[White House Chief of Staff]] [[H. R. Haldeman]] to put a "monkey wrench" into an early end to the war.<ref name=PBaker>{{cite news |last=Baker |first= Peter |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/02/us/politics/nixon-tried-to-spoil-johnsons-vietnam-peace-talks-in-68-notes-show.html?mcubz=0 |newspaper= New York Times |title= Nixon Tried to Spoil Johnson's Peace Talks in '68, Notes Show}}</ref> Johnson was enraged and said that Nixon had "blood on his hands" and that [[Senate Minority Leader]] [[Everett Dirksen]] agreed with Johnson that such action was "treason."<ref>Mark Lisheron.

===Election===
The election on November 5, 1968, proved to be extremely close, and it was not until the following morning that the television news networks were able to declare Nixon the winner. The key states proved to be California, Ohio, and Illinois, all of which Nixon won by three percentage points or less. Had Humphrey carried all three of these states, he would have won the election. Had he carried only two of them or just California among them, George Wallace would have succeeded in his aim of preventing an electoral college majority for any candidate, and the decision would have been given to the House of Representatives, at the time controlled by the Democratic Party. Nixon won the popular vote with a plurality of 512,000 votes, or a victory margin of about one percentage point. In the electoral college Nixon's victory was larger, as he carried 32 states with 301 electoral votes, compared to Humphrey's 13 states and 191 electoral votes and Wallace's five states and 46 electoral votes.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/national.php?year=1968|title=1968 Presidential General Election Results|last=Leip|first=David|website=David Leip's Atlas of Presidential Elections}}</ref>

Out of all the states that Nixon had previously carried in 1960, Maine and Washington were the only two states that did not vote for him again; Nixon carried them during his re-election campaign in 1972. He also carried eight states that voted for John F. Kennedy in 1960: Illinois, New Jersey, Missouri, North Carolina, South Carolina, New Mexico, Nevada and Delaware. This was the last time until 1988 that the state of Washington voted Democratic and until 1992 that Connecticut, Maine, and Michigan voted Democratic in the general election. Nixon was also the last Republican candidate to win a presidential election without carrying Alabama, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas. This is the first time which the Republican candidate captured the White House without carrying Michigan, Minnesota, Maine and Pennsylvania. He would be the last Republican candidate to carry Minnesota (four years later, in 1972), as of 2016.<ref name=":0" /> This is also the first time since 1916 that Minnesota voted for the candidate who did not eventually win.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.270towin.com/1916_Election/?m=In+1916,+Woodrow+Wilson+won+the+election+while+losing+Minnesota|title=Presidential Election of 1916|website=www.270towin.com|access-date=2019-02-01}}</ref>

Remarkably, Nixon won the election despite winning only two of the six states ([[Arizona]] and [[South Carolina]]) won by Republican Barry Goldwater four years earlier. He remains the only presidential candidate to win in spite of defending such a low number of his own party's states. All of the remaining four States carried by Goldwater were carried by Wallace in 1968. They would be won by Nixon in 1972.<ref name=":1" /><ref name=":0" />

Of the 3,130 counties/districts/independent cities making returns, Nixon won in 1,859 (59.39%) while Humphrey carried 693 (22.14%). Wallace was victorious in 578 counties (18.47%), all of which (with one exception of [[Pemiscot County, Missouri]])  were located in the [[Southern United States|South]].<ref name=":1" />

Nixon said that Humphrey left a gracious message congratulating him, noting, "I know exactly how he felt. I know how it feels to [[1960 United States presidential election|lose a close one]]."<ref name="1968 Year In Review, UPI.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.upi.com/Audio/Year_in_Review/Events-of-1968/1968-Presidential-Election/12303153093431-2/ |title=1968 Year In Review |publisher=UPI|accessdate=June 17, 2010}}</ref>

[[File:1968 Presidential Election, Results by Congressional District.png|thumb|right|250px|Results by congressional district.]]
Nixon's victory is often considered a [[realigning election]] in American politics. From 1932 to 1964, the Democratic Party was undoubtedly the majority party, winning seven out of nine presidential elections, and their agenda influenced policies undertaken by the Republican [[Eisenhower administration]]. The 1968 election reversed the situation completely. From 1968 until 2004, Republicans won seven out of ten presidential elections, and its policies clearly affected those enacted by the Democratic [[Clinton administration]] via the [[Third Way]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2008/10/a_realigning_election.html|title=A Realigning Election? {{!}} RealClearPolitics|website=www.realclearpolitics.com|access-date=2019-02-01}}</ref><ref name=":0" />

The election was a seismic event in the long-term realignment in Democratic Party support, especially in the South.<ref name="Misunderstanding the Southern Realignment">{{cite web|url=http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2010/09/09/misunderstanding_the_southern_realignment_107084.html |title=Misunderstanding the Southern Realignment |publisher=RealClearPolitics.com|accessdate=March 19, 2014}}</ref> Nationwide, the bitter splits over civil rights, the new left, the Vietnam War, and other "culture wars" were slow to heal. Democrats could no longer count on white Southern support for the presidency, as Republicans made major gains in suburban areas and areas filled with Northern migrants.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Silent Majority: Suburban Politics in the Sunbelt|last=Lassiter|first=Matthew|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2007|pages=2, 17}}</ref> The rural Democratic "[[courthouse clique]]s" in the South lost power. While Democrats controlled local and state politics in the South, Republicans usually won the presidential vote. In 1968, Humphrey won less than ten percent of the white Southern vote, with two-thirds of his vote in the region coming from blacks, who now voted in full strength.<ref>Gould (1993) p 165; White (1969) p 401</ref>

From 1968 until 2004, only two Democrats were elected president, both native Southerners – [[Jimmy Carter]] of Georgia and Bill Clinton of Arkansas. Not until 2008 did a Northern Democrat, [[Barack Obama]] of Illinois, again win a presidential election.<ref name=":0" /><ref>Michael A. Cohen, ''American Maelstrom: The 1968 Election and the Politics of Division'' (2016)</ref>

Another important result of this election was that it led to several reforms in how the Democratic Party chose its presidential nominees. In 1969, the [[McGovern–Fraser Commission]] adopted a set of rules for the states to follow in selecting convention delegates. These rules reduced the influence of party leaders on the nominating process and provided greater representation for minorities, women, and youth. The reforms led most states to adopt laws requiring primary elections, instead of party leaders, to choose delegates.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://poliscinews.wordpress.com/tag/mcgovern-fraser-commission/|title=McGovern-Fraser Commission {{!}} Politics Matters|language=en|access-date=2019-02-01}}</ref>

After 1968, the only way to win the party's presidential nomination became through the primary process; Humphrey turned out to be the last nominee of either major party to win his party's nomination without having directly competed in the primaries.

This remains most recent presidential election in which a sitting president eligible for re-election did not seek another term (and one of only two such elections to occur under the [[Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-second Amendment]], the first being the [[1952 United States presidential election|1952 election]]), and also the last election in which any third party candidate won an entire state's electoral votes, with Wallace carrying five states.<ref name=":0" />

This election was the last time until 1992 that the Democratic nominee won Connecticut, Maine, and Michigan and the last until 1988 when Washington voted Democrat, and the last time a Republican won the presidency without winning Alabama, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas.<ref name=":0" /> It was also the first time since 1888 that [[bellwether]] [[Coös County, New Hampshire]] did not support the winning candidate,<ref>The Political Graveyard; [http://politicalgraveyard.com/geo/NH/CO-votes.html Coös County Votes for President]<br />David Leip's Atlas of US Presidential Elections; [http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/state.php?year=2016&fips=33&f=0&off=0&elect=0 Presidential Election, 2016 in New Hampshire]</ref> which has occurred again only in [[2004 United States presidential election|2004]].

This was the first time since 1928 that North Carolina voted for a Republican, and the first since 1912 (only the second time since 1852 and as of 2016, the last time) that Maine and Vermont did not support same party. Similarly, it is the last time that Oregon and Washington did not support the same party, meaning the two neighbouring states have only voted for different candidates twice in 100 years.

Despite the narrow (0.7%) difference in the popular vote, Humphrey took only 35.5% of the electoral vote. This disparity prompted the introduction of the [[Electoral College (United States)#Bayh–Celler amendment|Bayh–Celler amendment]] in Congress, which would have replaced the Electoral College with a direct election of the presidency. The effort was not successful and the Electoral College is still in force.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/13012/first-and-last-serious-challenge-electoral-college-system|title=The First (And Last) Serious Challenge to the Electoral College System|date=2014-12-06|website=mentalfloss.com|language=en|access-date=2019-02-01}}</ref>
