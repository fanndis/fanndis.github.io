'''Del Mar''' is a beach city in [[San Diego County, California]], United States, incorporated on July 15, 1959. Del Mar is Spanish for "of the sea" or "by the sea," which reflects its location on the coast of the [[Pacific Ocean]]. The Del Mar Horse Races are hosted on the [[Del Mar racetrack]] every summer. 
In 1885, Colonel Jacob Taylor purchased {{convert|338|acre|km2}} from Enoch Talbert, with visions of building a seaside resort for the rich and famous.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.delmarhistoricalsociety.org/history.html |title=Del Mar city history |publisher=Delmarhistoricalsociety.org |date= |access-date=February 8, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081027094334/http://www.delmarhistoricalsociety.org/history.html |archive-date=October 27, 2008 |df=mdy }}</ref>  The [[United States Navy]] operated a [[U.S. Naval Air Facility Del Mar|Naval Auxiliary Air Facility]] for [[blimp]]s at Del Mar during [[World War II]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USN/ref/USN-Act/CA.html|title=U.S. Naval Activities World War II by State|publisher=Patrick Clancey|access-date=March 19, 2012}}</ref> The population was estimated at 4,347 in 2018, up from 4,161 at the 2010 census.<ref name="USCensusEst2018">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=October 22, 2019}}</ref>

==Geography==
Del Mar is one of only two locations where the [[Torrey Pine]] tree naturally occurs. The Torrey Pine is the rarest [[pine]] in the United States; only two populations of this [[endangered species]] exist, in Del Mar and on Santa Rosa Island.<ref>C. Michael Hogan (2008).

At the southern edge of Del Mar is the [[Los Peñasquitos Lagoon]]. To the north is the [[San Dieguito Lagoon State Marine Conservation Area|San Dieguito Lagoon]] and the [[San Dieguito River]], which empties into the Pacific Ocean at  Del Mar. The bluffs along Del Mar's south beach are subject to collapse.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2019-08-03/encinitas-beach-cliff-bluff-collapse-california-coast-erosion |title=Encinitas beach cliff collapse that killed 3 women part of larger California coast crisis |date=2019-08-03 |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |first=Alex |last=Riggins |first2=Gary |last2=Warth |first3=Shelby |last3=Grad |access-date=2020-07-20 |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20190804181327/https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2019-08-03/encinitas-beach-cliff-bluff-collapse-california-coast-erosion |archivedate=2019-08-04 |df=mdy-all |url-status=unfit}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2019-08-08/encinitas-cliff-collapse-erosion-california-coast|title=A cliff collapse.

That station provides [[Coaster commuter rail]] and Amtrak's [[Pacific Surfliner]] service.

The [[Surf Line|railroad tracks]] were built adjacent to coastal bluffs some {{convert|40 |feet}} above the beach. [[San Diego Association of Governments]] (SANDAG) is conducting a $3 million study on relocating the rail line farther inland through the city.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Little|first=Joe|date=September 22, 2020|title=Steel Beams Installed to Reinforce Del Mar Beach Bluffs|url=https://www.nbcsandiego.com/news/local/steel-beams-installed-to-reinforce-del-mar-beach-bluffs/2410679/ |access-date=2020-09-24|work=NBC 7 San Diego|language=en-US}}</ref> On August 16, 2020, the [[California Coastal Commission]] emphasized the need to move the railroad tracks inland due to the persistent coastal erosion which eats away at the bluff each year. The accelerating rate of [[sea level rise]] due to [[global warming]] adds urgency to the issue. A tunnel under Del Mar which would cost more than $3 billion is being considered.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Diehl|first=Phil|date=2020-08-16|title=State Coastal Commission says Del Mar train tracks need to move inland|url=https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/communities/north-county/del-mar/story/2020-08-16/state-coastal-commission-says-del-mar-train-tracks-need-to-move-inland|access-date=2020-08-16|work=San Diego Union-Tribune|language=en-US}}</ref>
