The '''third Merkel cabinet''' ([[German language|German]]: ''Kabinett Merkel III'') was the [[Cabinet of Germany|Government]] of the [[Germany|Federal Republic of Germany]] during the 18th legislative session of the [[Bundestag]]. Installed after the [[2013 German federal election|2013 federal election]], it left office on 14 March 2018. It was preceded by the [[second Merkel cabinet]] and succeeded by the [[fourth Merkel cabinet]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.bundestag.de/dokumente/textarchiv/2013/48311241_kw51_kanzlerwahl_nachher/214202 | title = Bundeskanzlerin und Bundeskabinett vereidigt | publisher = [[Deutscher Bundestag]] |trans-title=Federal Chancellor and cabinet sworn in| language  = German| accessdate = 16 June 2014}}</ref> Led by Chancellor [[Angela Merkel]], it was supported by a [[Coalition government|coalition]] of the [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany|Christian Democratic Union]] (CDU), the [[Christian Social Union of Bavaria]] (CSU), and the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democrats]] (SPD).<ref>based on Artikel 60 III of the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|Basic Law]]: [https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/gg/art_69.html Full text]</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.bundestag.de/dokumente/textarchiv/2013/48311241_kw51_kanzlerwahl_nachher/214202 | title = Bundeskanzlerin und Bundeskabinett vereidigt | publisher = [[Deutscher Bundestag]] |trans-title=Federal Chancellor and cabinet sworn in| language  = German| accessdate = 16 June 2014}}</ref>

The CDU received five ministries in addition to the positions of Chancellor, as well as Chancellery Chief of Staff and Minister for Special Affairs. The SPD controlled six ministries and the CSU three. Although the CSU received a disproportionate share of ministries relative to its weight in the Bundestag, the six most powerful ministries were divided equally between the CDU and the SPD: the CDU controls the ministries for finance, internal affairs, and defense, while the SPD controls the ministries for foreign affairs, economics and energy, and justice and consumer protection.<ref>Stephan Wallace (April 29, 2014), [http://www.aicgs.org/issue/ministry-for-economic-cooperation-and-development/ Commentary: Merkel’s Third Government – Return of the Grand Coalition] American Institute for Contemporary German Studies (AICGS) Washington, D.C.</ref>

The term of office of the third Merkel cabinet officially ended with the constitution of the 19th Bundestag on Tuesday, 24 October 2017. Merkel and her cabinet ministers received their discharge papers from the Federal President [[Frank-Walter Steinmeier]] on the same day. In accordance with Article 69 of the [[German constitution]] and at the request of the [[President of Germany]], the cabinet remained in office as the [[caretaker government]] until a new government is formed.<ref>{{Cite web |language=English |url=https://www.bundeskanzlerin.de/Content/EN/Artikel/2017/09_en/2017-09-25-nach-der-bundestagswahl_en.html |title=Government continues as acting government |access-date=14 January 2018 |date=24 October 2017 }}</ref>

==Caretaker government following the 2017 election== 
After the [[2017 German federal election|German federal election held on Sunday, 24 September 2017]], SPD leader [[Martin Schulz]] declared that the SPD had decided to be a part of the opposition during the next legislation period.<ref>Stefan Kuzmany / spiegel.de: [http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/opinion-a-new-germany-a-1169634.html ''A New Germany''], Spiegel.de.</ref> However, after coalition talks between the Union ([[CDU/CSU]]), [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|FDP]] and [[Alliance 90/The Greens|the Greens]] failed, SPD politicians reconsidered, leading to coalition negotiations between the CDU/CSU and the SPD. On 8 February 2018, the negotiations resulted in a provisional agreement to form a grand coalition,<ref>{{Cite news |website=Spiegel Online|access-date=8 February 2018 |date=7 February 2018 |title=Merkel Makes Painful Concessions to Form New Government |url= http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/breakthrough-merkel-makes-concessions-to-form-government-a-1192319.html}}</ref> which was approved by the party members of the SPD and led to the formation of the new government on 14 March 2018.
