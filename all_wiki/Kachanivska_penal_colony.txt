==History==
In 1927 the former estate of Russian landowner Kachanov was transformed into an affiliate of the Kharkiv "house of forced labor" (BUPR).<ref name=PSUKharkiv>{{in lang|uk}} [http://www.depkvs.kh.ua/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=278:kachanivskavk&catid=49:2011-03-31-20-05-37&Itemid=2 Penitentiary Service of Ukraine in Kharkiv] {{Webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/68m96xqKH?url=http://www.depkvs.kh.ua/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=278:kachanivskavk&catid=49:2011-03-31-20-05-37&Itemid=2 |date=2012-06-29 }}</ref> In the building were installed a shoe repair shop and a forge for the manufacture of agricultural tools. In 1941 when Kharkiv was occupied by [[Nazi Germany]] BUPR was evacuated to the east. After the liberation of the city, the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukrainian SSR in October 1943 re-established the prison as an industrial labor colony. The first party of convicts was accepted in February 1944. In 1948 the colony was reorganized as a juvenile colony.

In 1957 it became a "female labor colony".<ref name=PSUKharkiv/>
