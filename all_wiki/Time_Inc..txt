'''Time Inc.''' was an American worldwide [[mass media]] corporation founded on November 28, 1922, by [[Henry Luce]] and [[Briton Hadden]] and based in [[New York City]]. It owned and published over 100 magazine brands, including its namesake ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'', ''[[Travel + Leisure]]'', ''[[Food & Wine]]'', ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'', ''[[People (magazine)|People]]'', ''[[InStyle]]'', ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'', ''[[Golf Magazine]]'', ''[[Southern Living]]'', ''[[Essence (magazine)|Essence]]'', ''[[Real Simple]]'', and ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''. It also had subsidiaries which it co-operated with the UK magazine house Time Inc. UK (which later sold and since has been rebranded to [[TI Media]]), whose major titles include ''[[What's on TV]]'', ''[[NME]]'', ''[[Country Life (magazine)|Country Life]]'', and ''[[Wallpaper (magazine)|Wallpaper]]''. Time Inc. also co-operated over 60 websites and digital-only titles including ''MyRecipes'', ''Extra Crispy'', ''TheSnug'', [[HelloGiggles]], and ''MIMI''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20151019005413/en/Time-Acquires-HelloGiggles-Leading-Mobile-Social-Millennial|title=Time Inc.

In 1990, Time Inc. merged with Warner Communications to form the media conglomerate Time Warner (now [[AT&T]]-owned [[WarnerMedia]]).

==History==
===Beginnings===
Nightly discussions of the concept of a news magazine led its founders [[Henry Luce]] and [[Briton Hadden]], both age 23, to quit their jobs in 1922. Later that same year, they formed Time Inc. Having raised $86,000 of a $100,000 goal, the first issue of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' was published on March 3, 1923, as the first weekly news magazine in the United States.<ref name="History of TIME">{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/archive/collections/0,21428,c_time_history,00.shtml|title=History of TIME|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|publisher=Time Inc.|location=[[New York City]]|access-date=June 6, 2016}}</ref> Luce served as business manager while Hadden was editor-in-chief. Luce and Hadden annually alternated year-to-year the titles of president and secretary-treasurer. Upon Hadden's sudden death in 1929, Luce assumed Hadden's position.

Luce launched the business magazine ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'' in February 1930 and created/founded the pictorial ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine in 1936, and launched ''House & Home'' in 1952 and ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' in 1954. He also produced ''[[The March of Time]]'' [[The March of Time (radio program)|radio]] and newsreel series. By the mid-1960s, Time Inc. was the largest and most prestigious magazine publisher in the world. ([[Dwight Macdonald]], a ''Fortune'' staffer during the 1930s, referred to him as "Il Luce", a play on the Italian dictator [[Benito Mussolini]], who was called "[[Il Duce]]".) Once ambitious to become [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] in a Republican administration, Luce penned a famous article in ''Life'' magazine in 1941, called "[[The American Century]]", which defined the role of American foreign policy for the remainder of the 20th century, and perhaps beyond.<ref name=TIME-Obit-1967-03-10 />

President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], aware that most publishers were opposed to him, issued a decree in 1943 that blocked all publishers and media executives from visits to combat areas; he put General [[George Marshall]] in charge of enforcement. The main target was Luce, who had long opposed FDR.  Historian [[Alan Brinkley]] argues the move was "badly mistaken", for had Luce been allowed to travel, he would have been an enthusiastic cheerleader for American forces around the globe.  But stranded in New York City, Luce's frustration and anger expressed itself in hard-edged partisanship.{{sfn|Brinkley|2010|pages=302–303}}  Luce, supported by Editor [[T. S. Matthews]], appointed [[Whittaker Chambers]] as acting Foreign News editor in 1944, despite the feuds Chambers had with reporters in the field.{{sfn|Brinkley|2010|pages=322–393}}

In 1963, recommendations from Time Inc. executive David Brumbaugh based on how it delivered magazines led to the introduction of [[ZIP code]]s by the [[United States Post Office]]. In the 1950s, Brumbaugh made presentations to the Post Office Department to explain how Time Inc. was using a zoning system to speed the delivery of its magazines. Although the Post Office Department had instated zones in 1943, they were inconsistently applied. As cited in FYI, Time Inc.’s internal newsletter “‘Fewer than 40% of the cities were properly zoned,’ he recalls. ‘I went to the Post Office Department and showed them how we were making the zone system work.’”<ref>{{cite web |url=https://postalmuseum.si.edu/americasmailingindustry/Time-Inc.html |title=Time, Inc. |access-date=March 29, 2018 }}</ref>

Luce, who remained editor-in-chief of all his publications until 1964, maintained a position as an influential member of the [[History of the United States Republican Party|Republican Party]].<ref name=TIME-Obit-1967-03-10>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,836722,00.html|title=Henry R.

An instrumental figure behind the so-called "[[China Lobby]]", he played a large role in steering American foreign policy and popular sentiment in favor of [[Kuomintang|Nationalist]] leader [[Chiang Kai-shek]] and his wife [[Soong Mei-ling]] in their war against the Japanese. (The Chiangs appeared in the cover of ''Time'' eleven times between 1927 and 1955.<ref name="Time Magizine search">{{cite web|url=http://search.time.com/results.html?N=46&Ntt=Chiang|title=Time magazine historical search|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|publisher=Time Inc.|location=[[New York City]]|access-date=June 19, 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120630081514/http://search.time.com/results.html?N=46&Ntt=Chiang|archive-date=June 30, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref>)

===Merger with Warner Communications===
The merger of Time Inc. and Warner Communications was announced on March 4, 1989.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/03/05/us/time-inc-and-warner-to-merge-creating-largest-media-company.html|title=Time Inc. and Warner to Merge, Creating Largest Media Company|date=March 5, 1989|work=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]}}</ref> During the summer of that same year, [[Paramount Communications]] (formerly [[Gulf+Western]]) launched a $12.2 billion [[hostile bid]] to acquire Time Inc. in an attempt to end a [[stock swap]] merger deal between Time and Warner Communications. This caused Time to raise its bid for Warner to $14.9 billion in cash and stock. Paramount responded by filing a lawsuit in a Delaware court to block the Time/Warner merger. The court ruled twice in favor of Time, forcing Paramount to drop both the Time acquisition and the lawsuit, and allowing the formation of the two companies' merger which was completed on January 10, 1990. However, instead of the companies becoming defunct, the impact of the merger and its resultant financial shock wave gave off a new corporate structure, resulting in the new combined company being called "Time Warner".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://fortune.com/2018/02/02/the-healthiness-of-renewal/?xid=gn_editorspicks |title=On Groundhog Day, A Meditation on the Healthiness of Renewal |last=Leaf |first=Clifton |magazine=Fortune |date=February 2, 2018 |access-date=October 8, 2018}}</ref><ref>Bill Saporito,[http://fortune.com/2012/11/21/the-insde-story-of-time-warner/ "The Inside Story of Time Warner",''Fortune'',November 20,1989]</ref>

==Leadership==
In the early years, when the company was just ''Time'' magazine, Luce served as business manager while Hadden was editor-in-chief, and they annually alternated the positions of president and secretary-treasurer. On Hadden's sudden death in 1929 Luce took his position and business management was entrusted to Roy E. Larsen, who had been one of their first hires. Luce cultivated a philosophy of "church and state", where the editorial and business management were separate up to the board of directors level. (This was functionally ended with the departure of McManus from the Time Warner board, and formally by Ripp in 2013).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://adage.com/article/media/time-editors-report-business-side-shakeup/245046/|title=Time Inc.

On the merger with [[Warner Communications]] Munro and then Nicholas were co-CEOs of Time Warner with [[Steve Ross (businessman)|Steve Ross]] until 1992 when Ross squeezed Nicholas out.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://articles.latimes.com/1992-02-21/business/fi-2743_1_time-warner|title=Co-CEO Nicholas Ousted in Clash at Time Warner :  * Communications: New President Gerald M.

===Heads of Time within a parent===
The Time, Inc.

As the distinction between the overall corporation and the magazine operation grew, the position that had been "Group Vice President, Magazines" or "Executive Vice President, Magazines" became president and chief executive of a "magazine group" in 1985<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1985/11/21/Time-Inc-Thursday-announced-a-restructuring-of-its-magazine/4090501397200/ |title=Time Inc.

Meyers as chairman). In 1992, Time Warner reorganized so that the non-magazine parts of Time Inc. came directly under the parent and the Time Inc. name was downgraded to only include the magazine company, so the officers of the "Magazine Company" became the officers of what was now Time Inc. Later that year, CEO Brack shifted to chairman with [[Don Logan]] as president; he stepped down in favor of Logan as CEO in 1994 and chairman in 1997.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/1997/scene/vpage/brack-to-exit-slot-as-time-inc-chair-1117434387/|title=Brack to exit slot as Time Inc. chair|last=Levin|first=Gary|date=1997-04-23|work=Variety|access-date=2018-08-06|language=en-US}}</ref> Logan moved up to a group oversight position including additional Time Warner operations in 2002 ([[Ann S. Moore]] succeeding him at the magazine operation) and left the company in 2005. Leaders after Moore are noted above.
