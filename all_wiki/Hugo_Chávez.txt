'''Hugo Rafael Chávez Frías''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|tʃ|æ|v|ɛ|z}}, {{IPA-es|ˈuɣo rafaˈel ˈtʃaβes ˈfɾi.as|-|ES - Hugo Chávez.ogg}}; 28 July 1954&nbsp;– 5 March 2013) was a Venezuelan politician who was [[president of Venezuela]] from 1999 until his death in 2013 except for a brief period in April 2002. Chávez was also leader of the [[Fifth Republic Movement]] political party from its foundation in 1997 until 2007, when it merged with several other parties to form the [[United Socialist Party of Venezuela]] (PSUV), which he led until 2012.

Following the adoption of a new [[1999 Venezuelan Constitution|constitution in 1999]], Chávez focused on enacting social reforms as part of the [[Bolivarian Revolution]]. Using record-high oil revenues of the 2000s, his government [[nationalized]] key industries, created participatory democratic [[Venezuelan Communal Councils|Communal Councils]] and implemented social programs known as the [[Bolivarian missions]] to expand access to food, housing, healthcare and education.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://news.yahoo.com/venezuela-vote-puts-chavismo-critical-test-172039207.html | title=Venezuela vote puts 'Chavismo' to critical test | publisher=Yahoo | date=4 October 2012 | accessdate=2 February 2013 | first=Ian |last=James | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141205183325/http://news.yahoo.com/venezuela-vote-puts-chavismo-critical-test-172039207.html | url-status=live | archivedate=5 December 2014}}</ref><ref name="ECLAC">{{cite book|title=Social Panorama of Latin America 2014|publisher=[[ECLAC]]|date=March 2014|pages=91–92|url=http://repositorio.cepal.org/bitstream/handle/11362/37627/S1420728_en.pdf?sequence=4|accessdate=15 June 2015}}</ref><ref name=ENedu>{{cite news|last=Montilla K.|first=Andrea|title=Hoy se inicia consulta nacional para el currículo educativo|url=http://www.el-nacional.com/sociedad/Hoy-consulta-nacional-curriculo-educativo_0_395960640.html|accessdate=24 April 2014|newspaper=El Nacional|date=23 April 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140424094406/http://www.el-nacional.com/sociedad/Hoy-consulta-nacional-curriculo-educativo_0_395960640.html|archivedate=24 April 2014}}</ref><ref name="Márquez">{{cite web|last=Márquez|first=Humberto|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402112614/http://www.ipsnoticias.net/2005/10/educacion-venezuela-se-declara-libre-de-analfabetismo/|archivedate=2 April 2015|url-status=dead|title=Venezuela se declara libre de analfabetismo|publisher=[[Inter Press Service]]|url=http://ipsnoticias.net/nota.asp?idnews=35621|date=28 October 2005|accessdate=29 December 2006|language=es}}</ref><ref name="ECONread">{{cite news | url=http://www.economist.com/node/10766504 | title=Propaganda, not policy | date=28 February 2008 | accessdate=3 May 2014 | newspaper=The Economist| archivedate=25 August 2014 | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140825044345/http://www.economist.com/node/10766504}}</ref><ref name=RevistedHouseholds>{{cite web|title='Illiteracy' Revisited: What Ortega and Rodríguez Read in the Household Survey|url=http://www.cepr.net/documents/publications/literacy_2008_05.pdf|accessdate=3 May 2014|last1=Weisbrot|last2=Rosnick|first1=Mark|first2=David|date=May 2008}}</ref> The high oil profits coinciding with the start of Chavez's presidency<ref name=FPpoverty>{{cite news|last1=Cristóbal Nagel|first1=Juan|title=Poverty Shoots Up in Venezuela|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2014/06/04/poverty-shoots-up-in-venezuela/|accessdate=26 October 2015|agency=[[Foreign Policy]]|date=4 June 2014}}</ref> resulted in temporary improvements in areas such as poverty, literacy, income equality and quality of life between primarily 2003 and 2007,<ref name="UN"/><ref name=FPpoverty/><ref name=IACHRRequests/> though extensive changes in [[structural inequality|structural inequalities]] did not occur.<ref name="NACLAcrimeREV">{{cite journal|last1=Smilde|first1=David|title=Crime and Revolution in Venezuela|journal=[[NACLA Report on the Americas]]|date=14 September 2017|volume=49|issue=3|pages=303–08|doi=10.1080/10714839.2017.1373956|s2cid=158528940|issn=1071-4839|quote=Finally, it is important to realize that the reductions in poverty and inequality during the Chávez years were real, but somewhat superficial.

Internationally, Chávez aligned himself with the [[Marxism–Leninism|Marxist–Leninist]] governments of [[Fidel Castro|Fidel]] and then [[Raúl Castro]] in [[Cuba]], as well as the socialist governments of [[Evo Morales]] in [[Bolivia]], [[Rafael Correa]] in [[Ecuador]] and [[Daniel Ortega]] in [[Nicaragua]].

==Early life==
{{Main|Early life of Hugo Chávez}}
[[File:Hugo Chávez adolescent.png|thumb|left|130px|Chávez as an adolescent]]

==Military career==
===Military academy===
Aged 17, Chávez studied at the [[Venezuelan Academy of Military Sciences]] in Caracas, following a curriculum known as the [[Andrés Bello]] Plan, instituted by a group of progressive, nationalistic military officers. This new curriculum encouraged students to learn not only military routines and tactics but also a wide variety of other topics, and to do so civilian professors were brought in from other universities to give lectures to the military cadets.<ref name="Cannon 2009. p. 55">[[#Can09|Cannon 2009]]. p. 55.</ref><ref>[[#Mar07|Marcano and Tyszka 2007]]. p. 30.</ref><ref>[[#Jon07|Jones 2007]]. p. 38.</ref>
[[File:Hugo Chávez military academy.png|alt=|left|thumb|249x249px|Chávez as a student in the military academy]]

In Peru, Chávez heard the leftist president, General [[Juan Velasco Alvarado]] (1910–1977), speak, and inspired by Velasco's ideas that the military should act in the interests of the working classes when the ruling classes were perceived as corrupt,<ref name="Marcano and Tyszka. p. 36">[[#Mar07|Marcano and Tyszka 2007]]. p. 36.</ref> he "drank up the books [Velasco had written], even memorising some speeches almost completely".<ref>Chávez quoted in [[#Jon07|Jones 2007]]. pp. 40–47.</ref>

Befriending the son of Maximum Leader [[Omar Torrijos]], the leftist dictator of Panama, Chávez visited Panama, where he met with Torrijos, and was impressed with his land reform program that was designed to benefit the peasants.

| source = —Hugo Chávez<ref>Chávez quoted in [[#Jon07|Jones 2007]] pp. 54–55.</ref>
}}

Following his graduation, Chávez was stationed as a communications officer at a [[counterinsurgency]] unit in Barinas,<ref>[[#Mar07|Marcano and Tyszka 2007]]. p. 38.</ref> although the [[Marxist–Leninist]] insurgency which the army was sent to combat had already been eradicated from that state.<ref>[[#Jon07|Jones 2007]]. pp. 57–59.</ref> At one point he found a stash of Marxist literature that apparently had belonged to insurgents many years before. He went on to read these books, which included titles by [[Karl Marx]], [[Vladimir Lenin]], and [[Mao Zedong]], but his favorite was a work entitled ''The Times of Ezequiel Zamora'', written about [[Ezequiel Zamora|the 19th-century federalist general]] whom Chávez had admired as a child.<ref>[[#Jon07|Jones 2007]]. p. 59.</ref> These books further convinced Chávez of the need for a leftist government in Venezuela: "By the time I was 21 or 22, I made myself a man of the left".<ref name="Chávez p. 59">Chávez, quoted in [[#Jon07|Jones 2007]]. p. 59.</ref>

In 1977, Chávez's unit was transferred to [[Anzoátegui]], where they were involved in battling the [[Red Flag Party]], a Marxist–[[Hoxhaist]] insurgency group.<ref>[[#Mar07|Marcano and Tyszka 2007]]. p. 39.</ref> After intervening to prevent the beating of an alleged insurgent by other soldiers,<ref name="Marcano and Tyszka p.41">[[#Mar07|Marcano and Tyszka 2007]]. p. 41.</ref> Chávez began to have his doubts about the army and their methods in using torture.<ref name="Chávez p. 59"/> At the same time, he was becoming increasingly critical of the corruption in the army and in the civilian government, coming to believe Venezuela's poor were not benefiting from the oil wealth, and began to sympathize with the Red Flag Party and their cause and their violent methods.<ref>Chávez, quoted in [[#Jon07|Jones 2007]]. pp. 60–64.</ref>

In 1977, he founded a revolutionary movement within the armed forces, in the hope that he could one day introduce a leftist government to Venezuela: the Venezuelan People's Liberation Army (''{{lang|es|Ejército de Liberación del Pueblo de Venezuela}}'', or ELPV), consisted of him and a handful of his fellow soldiers who had no immediate plans for direct action, though they knew they wanted a middle way between the right-wing policies of the government and the far-left position of the Red Flag.<ref name="Marcano and Tyszka p.41"/><ref>[[#Jon07|Jones 2007]]. pp. 63–65.</ref><ref>[[#Wil07|Wilpert 2007]]. p. 15.</ref> Nevertheless, hoping to gain an alliance with civilian leftist groups in Venezuela, Chávez set up clandestine meetings with various prominent Marxists, including Alfredo Maneiro (the founder of the [[Radical Cause]]) and [[Douglas Bravo]].<ref>[[#Can09|Cannon 2009]]. p. 54.</ref><ref>[[#Jon07|Jones 2007]]. pp. 65–77.</ref> At this time, Chávez married a working-class woman named Nancy Colmenares, with whom he had three children: Rosa Virginia (born September 1978), [[María Gabriela Chávez|María Gabriela]] (born March 1980) and Hugo Rafael (born October 1983).<ref>[[#Jon07|Jones 2007]]. p. 634.</ref>

===Bolivarian Revolutionary Army-200===
[[File:Hugo Chávez military.png|thumb|Chávez while serving in the [[Venezuelan Army]]]]
Five years after his creation of the ELPV, Chávez went on to form a new secretive cell within the military, the [[Revolutionary Bolivarian Movement-200|Bolivarian Revolutionary Army-200]] (EBR-200), later redesignated the Revolutionary Bolivarian Movement-200 (MBR-200).<ref name="Cannon 2009. p. 55"/><ref>[[#Mar07|Marcano and Tyszka 2007]]. pp. 48–49, 56.</ref><ref>[[#Wil07|Wilpert 2007]]. p. 16.</ref> He was inspired by [[Ezequiel Zamora]] (1817–1860), [[Simón Bolívar]] (1783–1830) and [[Simón Rodríguez]] (1769–1854), who became known as the "three roots of the tree" of the MBR-200.<ref>[[#Got05|Gott 2005]]. pp. 23–24.</ref><ref>[[#Can09|Cannon 2009]]. p. 56.</ref> Later, Chávez said that "the Bolivarian movement that was being born did not propose political objectives... Its goals were imminently internal. Its efforts were directed in the first place to studying the military history of Venezuela as a source of a military doctrine of our own, which up to then didn't exist".<ref>Chávez, quoted in [[#Jon07|Jones 2007]]. p. 80.</ref> However, he always hoped for the Bolivarian Movement to become a politically dominant party that would "accept all kinds of ideas, from the right, from the left, from the ideological ruins of those old capitalist and communist systems".<ref>Chávez, quoted in [[#Jon07|Jones 2007]]. p. 81.</ref> Indeed, Irish political analyst Barry Cannon noted that the MBR's early ideology "was a doctrine in construction, a heterogeneous amalgam of thoughts and ideologies, from universal thought, capitalism, Marxism, but rejecting the neoliberal models currently being imposed in Latin America and the discredited models of the old Soviet Bloc".<ref name="Cannon2009 58">[[#Can09|Cannon 2009]]. p. 58.</ref>

In 1981, Chávez, by now a captain, was assigned to teach at the military academy where he had formerly trained. Here he introduced new students to his so-called "Bolivarian" ideals and recruited some of them. By the time they had graduated, at least thirty out of 133 cadets had joined his cause.<ref>[[#Jon07|Jones 2007]]. pp. 83–85.</ref> In 1984 he met [[Herma Marksman]], a recently divorced history teacher with whom he had an affair that lasted several years.<ref>[[#Mar07|Marcano and Tyszka 2007]]. pp. 51–53.</ref><ref>[[#Jon07|Jones 2007]]. pp. 86–90.</ref> During this time [[Francisco Arias Cárdenas]], a soldier interested in [[liberation theology]], also joined MBR-200.<ref>[[#Jon07|Jones 2007]]. pp. 92–93.</ref> Cárdenas rose to a significant position within the group, although he came into ideological conflict with Chávez, with Chávez believing that they should begin direct military action in order to overthrow the government, something Cárdenas thought was reckless.<ref>Cárdenas, quoted in [[#Jon07|Jones 2007]]. pp. 92–93.</ref>

After some time, some senior military officers became suspicious of Chávez and reassigned him so that he would not be able to gain any more fresh new recruits from the academy. He was sent to take command of the remote barracks at [[Elorza]] in [[Apure State]],<ref>[[#Mar07|Marcano and Tyszka 2007]]. p. 50.</ref> where he organized social events for the community and contacted the local indigenous tribal peoples, the [[Cuiva]] and [[Yaruro people|Yaruro]]. Distrustful as they were because of the mistreatment at the hands of the Venezuelan army in previous decades, Chávez gained their trust by joining the expeditions of an [[anthropology|anthropologist]] to meet with them. Chávez said his experiences with them later led him to introduce laws protecting the rights of indigenous tribal peoples.<ref>[[#Jon07|Jones 2007]]. pp. 98–102.</ref> In 1988, after being promoted to the rank of major, the high-ranking General Rodríguez Ochoa took a liking to Chávez and employed him to be his assistant at his office in Caracas.<ref>[[#Jon07|Jones 2007]]. pp. 105, 108.</ref>

Beginning 27 February 1999, the tenth anniversary of the ''[[Caracazo]]'', Chávez set into motion a social welfare program called [[Plan Bolívar 2000]]. He said he had allotted $20.8&nbsp;million for the plan, though some say that the program cost $113&nbsp;million. The plan involved 70,000 soldiers, sailors and members of the air force repairing roads and hospitals, removing stagnant water that offered breeding areas for disease-carrying mosquitoes, offering free medical care and vaccinations, and selling food at low prices.<ref name=USb2000>{{cite web

===Second presidential term: 10 January 2001 – 10 January 2007===
[[File:HugoChavez1820.jpeg|thumb|right|Chávez visiting [[Porto Alegre]], Brazil in 2003]]
Under the new constitution, it was legally required that new elections be held in order to re-legitimize the government and president. This [[2000 Venezuelan presidential election|presidential election in July 2000]] would be a part of a greater "megaelection", the first time in the country's history that the president, governors, national and regional congressmen, mayors and councilmen would be voted for on the same day.<ref>[[#Mar07|Marcano and Tyszka 2007]]. p. 140.</ref><ref>[[#Koz06|Kozloff 2006]]. p. 88.</ref><ref name="Cannon2009 63">[[#Can09|Cannon 2009]]. p. 63.</ref> Going into the elections, Chávez had control of all three branches of government.<ref name=Nelson1/> For the position of president, Chávez's closest challenger proved to be his former friend and co-conspirator in the 1992 coup, [[Francisco Arias Cárdenas]], who since becoming governor of Zulia state had turned towards the political centre and begun to denounce Chávez as autocratic.<ref name="Cannon2009 42">[[#Can09|Cannon 2009]]. p. 42.</ref> Although some of his supporters feared that he had alienated those in the middle class and the Roman Catholic Church hierarchy who had formerly supported him, Chávez was re-elected with 60% of the vote (the equivalent of 3,757,000 people), a larger majority than his 1998 electoral victory,<ref name="ReferenceC">[[#Mar07|Marcano and Tyszka 2007]]. p. 141.</ref><ref name="Ramírez 2005. p. 79">[[#Ram05|Ramírez 2005]]. p. 79.</ref> again primarily receiving his support from the poorer sectors of Venezuelan society.<ref>[[#Can09|Cannon 2009]]. pp. 42–44.</ref>

That year, Chávez helped to further cement his geopolitical and ideological ties with the Cuban government of Fidel Castro by signing an agreement under which Venezuela would supply Cuba with 53,000 barrels of oil per day at preferential rates, in return receiving 20,000 trained Cuban medics and educators. In the ensuing decade, this would be increased to 90,000 barrels a day (in exchange for 40,000 Cuban medics and teachers), dramatically aiding the Caribbean island's economy and standard of living after its "[[Special Period]]" of the 1990s.<ref>[[#Koz08|Kozloff 2008]]. pp. 23–24.</ref> However, Venezuela's growing alliance with Cuba came at the same time as a deteriorating relationship with the United States: in late 2001, just after the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|American-led invasion of Afghanistan]] in retaliation for [[11 September attacks]] against the U.S. by Islamist militants, Chávez showed pictures of Afghan children killed in a bomb attack on his television show. He commented that "They are not to blame for the terrorism of [[Osama Bin Laden]] or anyone else", and called on the American government to end "the massacre of the innocents. Terrorism cannot be fought with terrorism." The U.S. government responded negatively to the comments, which were picked up by the media worldwide<ref>[[#Mar07|Marcano and Tyszka 2007]]. pp. 208–09.</ref> and recalled its ambassador for "consultations".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/11/03/world/us-irritated-by-criticism-calls-envoy-home-from-venezuela.html|title=U.S., Irritated by Criticism, Calls Envoy Home From Venezuela|last=Rohter|first=Larry|date=3 November 2001|work=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref>

[[File:Mision robinson wayuu by Franklin Reyes.png|thumb|left|Chávez's second term in office saw the implementation of social missions, such as this one to eliminate illiteracy in Venezuela]]

Meanwhile, the 2000 elections had led to Chávez's supporters gaining 101 out of 165 seats in the Venezuelan National Assembly, and so in November 2001 they voted to allow him to pass 49 social and economic decrees.<ref name="InternationalCrisisGroup07"/><ref>[[#Mar07|Marcano and Tyszka 2007]]. p. 143.</ref> This move antagonized the opposition movement particularly strongly.<ref name="Cannon2009 63"/>

At the start of the 21st century, Venezuela was the world's fifth largest exporter of [[crude oil]], with oil accounting for 85% of the country's exports, therefore dominating the country's economy.<ref name="Kozloff08 18-23">[[#Koz08|Kozloff 2008]]. pp. 18–23.</ref><ref name="Cannon2009 32">[[#Can09|Cannon 2009]]. p. 32.</ref> Previous administrations had sought to privatize this industry, with U.S. corporations having a significant level of control, but the Chávez administration wished to curb this foreign control over the country's natural resources by nationalising much of it under the state-run oil company, [[Petróleos de Venezuela S.A.]] (PDVSA). In 2001, the government introduced a new Hydrocarbons Law through which they sought to gain greater state control over the oil industry: they did this by raising royalty taxes on the oil companies and also by introducing the formation of "mixed companies", whereby the PdVSA could have joint control with private companies over industry. By 2006, all of the 32 operating agreements signed with private corporations during the 1990s had been converted from being primarily or solely corporate-run to being at least 51% controlled by PDVSA.<ref name="Kozloff08 18-23"/> Chávez had also removed many of the managers and executives of PdVSA and replaced them with political allies, stripping the state-owned company expertise.<ref name=":6">{{cite web|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/07/16/how-venezuela-struck-it-poor-oil-energy-chavez/|title=How Hugo Chávez Blew Up Venezuela's Oil Patch|last=Johnson|first=Keith|date=16 July 2018|website=[[Foreign Policy]]|language=en|access-date=21 July 2018|quote=The fuse for the bomb that is now blowing up Venezuela’s oil industry – and the country along with it – was deliberately lit and fanned by ... the strongman Hugo Chávez ...}}</ref>

====Opposition and the CD====
During Chávez's first term in office, the opposition movement had been "strong but reasonably contained, [with] complaints centering mainly on procedural aspects of the implementation of the constitution".<ref name="Cannon2009 63"/> However, much of Chávez's opposition originated from the response to the "cubanization" of Venezuela.<ref name=Nelson1/> Chávez's popularity dropped due to his relationship with Fidel Castro and Cuba, with Chávez attempting to make Venezuela in Cuba's image.<ref name=Nelson1/> Chávez, following Castro's example, consolidated the country's [[bicameral legislature]] into a single [[National Assembly (Venezuela)|National Assembly]] that gave him more power<ref name=CONS/> and created community groups of loyal supporters allegedly trained as paramilitaries.<ref name=Nelson1/> Such actions created great fear among Venezuelans who felt like they were tricked and that Chávez had dictatorial goals.<ref name=Nelson1/>

The first organized protest against the Bolivarian government occurred in January 2001, when the Chávez administration tried to implement educational reforms through the proposed Resolution 259 and Decree 1.011, which would have seen the publication of textbooks with a heavy Bolivarian bias. Parents noticed that such textbooks were really Cuban books filled with [[Bolivarian propaganda|revolutionary propaganda]] outfitted with different covers. The protest movement, which was primarily by middle class parents whose children went to privately run schools, marched to central Caracas shouting out the slogan ''Con mis hijos no te metas'' ("Don't mess with my children"). Although the protesters were denounced by Chávez, who called them "selfish and individualistic", the protest was successful enough for the government to retract the proposed education reforms and instead enter into a consensus-based educational program with the opposition.<ref name=Nelson1/><ref>[[#Mar07|Marcano and Tyszka 2007]]. pp. 143–45.</ref>

Later into 2001, an organization known as the ''{{lang|es|Coordinadora Democrática de Acción Cívica}}'' (CD) was founded, under which the Venezuelan opposition political parties, corporate powers, most of the country's media, the [[Venezuelan Federation of Chambers of Commerce]], the Institutional Military Front and the [[Central Workers Union]] all united to oppose Chávez's regime.<ref name="InternationalCrisisGroup07">[[#Int07|International Crisis Group 2007]]. p. 7.</ref><ref>[[#Ram05|Ramírez 2005]]. p. 80.</ref> The prominent businessman [[Pedro Carmona]] (1941–) was chosen as the CD's leader.<ref name="InternationalCrisisGroup07"/> [[File:Hugo Chávez on USS Yorktown.jpg|thumb|right|Chávez visiting the [[USS Yorktown (CG-48)|USS ''Yorktown'']], a U.S. Navy ship docked at [[Curaçao]] in the [[Netherlands Antilles]], in 2002]] The CD and other opponents of Chávez's Bolivarian government accused it of trying to turn Venezuela from a democracy into a dictatorship by centralising power amongst its supporters in the Constituent Assembly and granting Chávez increasingly autocratic powers. Many of them pointed to Chávez's personal friendship with Cuba's Fidel Castro and the [[Politics in Cuba|one-party socialist government in Cuba]] as a sign of where the Bolivarian government was taking Venezuela.<ref name="InternationalCrisisGroup07"/> Others did not hold such a strong view but still argued that Chávez was a "free-spending, authoritarian [[populism|populist]]" whose policies were detrimental to the country.<ref>[[#Can09|Cannon 2009]]. p. 1.</ref>

Chávez's response was to moderate his approach,{{Disputed inline|date=April 2020}} implementing a new economic team that appeared to be more centrist and reinstated the old board of directors and managers of the state oil company [[Petróleos de Venezuela S.A.]] (PDVSA), whose replacement had been one of the reasons for the coup.<ref>[[Hugo Chávez#Mar07|Marcano and Tyszka 2007]]. p. 185.</ref><ref>[[Hugo Chávez#Wil07|Wilpert 2007]]. p. 24.</ref> At the same time, the Bolivarian government began to increase the country's military capacity, purchasing 100,000 [[AK-47]] assault rifles and several helicopters from Russia, as well as a number of [[Super Tucano]] light attack and training planes from Brazil. Troop numbers were also increased.<ref>[[Hugo Chávez#Koz08|Kozloff 2008]]. p. 71.</ref>

The 1999 constitution had introduced the concept of a recall referendum into Venezuelan politics, so the opposition called for such a referendum to take place. A [[2004 Venezuelan recall referendum|2004 referendum to recall Chávez]] was defeated. 70% of the eligible Venezuelan population turned out to vote, with 59% of voters deciding to keep the president in power.<ref name="Ramírez 2005. p. 79"/><ref name="Cannon2009 64">[[#Can09|Cannon 2009]]. p. 64.</ref> Unlike his original 1998 election victory, this time Chávez's electoral support came almost entirely from the poorer working classes rather than the middle classes, who "had practically abandoned Chávez" after he "had consistently moved towards the left in those five and a half years".<ref>[[#Wil07|Wilpert 2007]]. p. 19.</ref>

===="Socialism of the 21st century"====
The various attempts at overthrowing the Bolivarian government from power had only served to further radicalize Chávez.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} In January 2005, he began openly proclaiming the ideology of "[[socialism of the 21st century]]", something that was distinct from his earlier forms of [[Bolivarianism]], which had been [[Social democracy|social democratic]] in nature, merging elements of capitalism and socialism. He used this new term to contrast the [[democratic socialism]], which he wanted to promote in Latin America, from the Marxist–Leninist socialism that had been spread by socialist states like the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China during the 20th century, arguing that the latter had not been truly democratic, suffering from a lack of participatory democracy and an excessively authoritarian governmental structure.<ref name="Cannon2009 58"/>

In May 2006, Chávez visited Europe in a private capacity, where he announced plans to supply cheap Venezuelan oil to poor working class communities in the continent. The Mayor of London [[Ken Livingstone]] welcomed him, describing him as "the best news out of Latin America in many years".<ref>[[#Obs06|''The Observer'' 2006]].</ref>

On 15 December 2006, Chávez publicly announced that those leftist political parties who had continually supported him in the Patriotic Pole would unite into one single, much larger party, the [[United Socialist Party of Venezuela]] (''Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela'', PSUV).<ref name="Cannon2009 59"/> In the speech which he gave announcing the PSUV's creation, Chávez declared that the old parties must "forget their own structures, party colours and slogans, because they are not the most important thing for the fatherland".<ref name="Cannon2009 59"/> According to political analyst Barry Cannon, the purpose of creating the PSUV was to "forge unity amongst the disparate elements [of the Bolivarian movement], providing grassroots input into policy and leadership formation, [and] uniting the grassroots and leadership into one single body".<ref name="Cannon2009 60">[[#Can09|Cannon 2009]]. p. 60.</ref> It was hoped that by doing so, it would decrease the problems of clientelism and corruption and also leave the movement less dependent on its leadership:<ref name="Cannon2009 60"/> as Chávez himself declared, "In this new party, the bases will elect the leaders.

In 2007, the Bolivarian government set up a constitutional commission in order to review the 1999 constitution and suggest potential amendments to be made to it. Led by the prominent pro-Chávez intellectual [[Luis Britto García]], the commission came to the conclusion that the constitution could include more socially progressive clauses, such as the shortening of the working week, a constitutional recognition of [[Afro Venezuelans]] and the elimination of discrimination on the grounds of [[sexual orientation]].<ref name="Cannon2009 64" /> It also suggested measures that would have increased many of the president's powers, for instance increasing the presidential term limit to seven years, allowing the president to run for election indefinitely and centralizing powers in the executive.<ref name="Cannon2009 64" /> The government put the suggested changes to a [[2007 Venezuelan constitutional referendum|public referendum in December 2007]].<ref name="reuters20070816">{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUSN1526395420070816|title=Venezuela's Chávez calls for end to term limits|accessdate=16 August 2007|work=Reuters|date=16 August 2007|last=Ellsworth |first=Brian}}</ref> Abstention rate was high however, with 44% of registered voters not turning out, and in the end the proposed changes were rejected by 51% of votes.<ref name="Cannon2009 64" /><ref>{{Cite news|url= https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/04/world/americas/04venezuela.html |title= Venezuela Vote Sets Roadblocks on Chávez Path |work= The New York Times|date = 4 December 2007 |accessdate=26 February 2010 |last=Romero |first=Simon}}</ref> This would prove to the first electoral loss that Chávez had faced in the thirteen electoral contests held since he took power,<ref name="Cannon2009 64" /> something analysts argued was due to the top-down nature of the changes, as well as general public dissatisfaction with "the absence of internal debate on its content, as well as dissatisfaction with the running of the social programmes, increasing street crime, and with corruption within the government".<ref name="Cannon2009 64-65">[[#Can09|Cannon 2009]]. pp. 64–65.</ref>

The inauguration of Chávez's new term was scheduled for 10 January 2013, but as he was undergoing medical treatment at the time in Cuba, he was not able to return to Venezuela for that date. The National Assembly president [[Diosdado Cabello]] proposed to postpone the inauguration and the Supreme Court decided that, being just another term of the sitting president and not the inauguration of a new one, the formality could be bypassed. The [[Roman Catholicism in Venezuela|Venezuelan Bishops Conference]] opposed the verdict, stating that the constitution must be respected and the Venezuelan government had not been transparent regarding details about Chávez's health.<ref>{{cite news |title=Church warns Venezuela govt on constitution |agency=[[Agence France-Presse]] |url=http://www.france24.com/en/20130107-church-warns-venezuela-govt-constitution |newspaper=France 24 |date=7 January 2013 |accessdate=8 January 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130111082713/http://www.france24.com/en/20130107-church-warns-venezuela-govt-constitution |archivedate=11 January 2013}}</ref>

| quote = Democracy is impossible in a capitalist system. Capitalism is the realm of injustice and a tyranny of the richest against the poorest. [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]] said, 'Between the powerful and the weak all freedom is oppressed. Only the rule of law sets you free.' That's why the only way to save the world is through socialism, a democratic socialism... [Democracy is not just turning up to vote every four or five years], it's much more than that, it's a way of life, it's giving power to the people... it is not the government of the rich over the people, which is what's happening in almost all the so-called democratic Western capitalist countries.

Chávez propagated what he called "socialism for the 21st century", but according to the pro-Chavez academic [[Gregory Wilpert]], "Chávez has not clearly defined twenty-first century socialism, other than to say that it is about establishing [[liberty]], [[Egalitarianism|equality]], [[social justice]], and [[solidarity]]. He has also indicated that it is distinctly different from [[state socialism]]", as implemented by the governments of the [[Soviet Union]] and the People's Republic of China.<ref>[[#Wil07|Wilpert 2007]] p. 07.</ref> As a part of his socialist ideas, he emphasised the role of "[[participatory democracy]]", which he said increased democratic participation, and was implemented through the foundation of the [[Venezuelan Communal Councils]] and [[Bolivarian Circles]] which he cited as examples of grassroots and participatory democracy.<ref>Sojo, Cleto A.

===Bolivarianism===

Hugo Chávez defined his political position as [[Bolivarianism]], an ideology he developed from that of [[Simón Bolívar]] (1783–1830) and others. Bolívar was a 19th-century general who led the fight against the [[colonialism|colonialist]] Spanish authorities and who is widely revered across Latin America today. Along with Bolívar, the other two primary influences upon Bolivarianism are [[Simón Rodríguez]] (1769–1854), a philosopher who was Bolívar's tutor and mentor, and [[Ezequiel Zamora]], (1817–1860), the Venezuelan Federalist general.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Cameron|first=Maxwell|year=2001|title=Venezuela's Hugo Chávez: Savior or Threat to Democracy?|journal=Latin American Research Review|volume=36|issue=3|page=263}}.

In many ways this is not a particularly different set of principles and ideas to those of any other [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] or national liberation thinker."<ref>[[#Wil07|Wilpert 2007]] p. 16.</ref> The fact that Chávez's ideology originated from Bolívar has also received some criticism because Chávez had occasionally described himself as being influenced by [[Karl Marx]], a critic of Bolívar.<ref name="marx">{{cite web

===Marxism===
Chávez's connection to [[Marxism]] was a complex one, though he had described himself as a Marxist on some occasions.<ref name="en.ria.ru">{{cite web|url=http://en.ria.ru/world/20100116/157569985.html|title=Hugo Chavez admits to being Marxist, just like Christ &#124; World &#124; RIA Novosti|date=16 January 2010|publisher=En.ria.ru|accessdate=19 May 2014}}</ref><ref name=BBCmarx/><ref name=N24marx/><ref name=ABCmarx/><ref name=CLARINmarx/> In May 1996, he gave an interview with Agustín Blanco Muñoz in which he remarked, "I am not a Marxist, but I am not anti-Marxist.

I am a Trotskyist', and I said, 'well, what is the problem? I am also a Trotskyist!

In 2010, Chávez supported the construction of 184 [[communes]], housing thousands of families, with $23&nbsp;million in government funding. The communes produced some of their own food, and were able to make decisions by popular assembly of what to do with government funds.<ref>Pearson, Tamara [http://venezuelanalysis.com/news/5123 184 Communes Currently in Formation in Venezuela], ''Venezuela Analysis''</ref> In September 2010, Chávez announced the location of 876&nbsp;million bolivars ($203&nbsp;million) for community projects around the country, specifically communal councils and the newly formed communes.

In the first few years of Chavez's office, his newly created social programs required large payments in order to make the desired changes. On 5 February 2003, the government created [[CADIVI]], a currency control board charged with handling foreign exchange procedures. Its creation was to control [[capital flight]] by placing limits on individuals and only offering them so much of a foreign currency.<ref>CADIVI, [http://www.cadivi.gov.ve/cadivi/cadivi.html CADIVI, una medidia necesaria] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205143924/http://www.cadivi.gov.ve/cadivi/cadivi.html |date=5 December 2008 }}</ref> This limit to foreign currency led to a creation of a currency [[black market]] economy since Venezuelan merchants rely on foreign goods that require payments with reliable foreign currencies. As Venezuela printed more money for their social programs, the bolívar continued to devalue for Venezuelan citizens and merchants since the government held the majority of the more reliable currencies.<ref>{{cite web |last=Hanke |first=Steve |title=The World's Troubled Currencies |url=http://www.marketoracle.co.uk/Article41552.html |publisher=The Market Oracle |accessdate=26 January 2014}}</ref>

The implied value or "black market value" is what Venezuelans believe the [[Bolivar Fuerte]] is worth compared to the [[United States dollar]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Venezuela's black market rate for US dollars just jumped by almost 40% |url=http://qz.com/192395/venezuelas-black-market-rate-for-us-dollars-just-jumped-by-almost-40/#/h/56869,3/ |accessdate=27 March 2014 |newspaper=Quartz |date=26 March 2014}}</ref> The high rates in the black market make it difficult for businesses to purchase necessary goods since the government often forces these businesses to make price cuts.

Chávez supporters stated that the Bolivarian National Police has reduced crime and also said that the states with the highest murder rates were controlled by the opposition.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://stream.aljazeera.com/story/violence-venezuela |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111003632/http://stream.aljazeera.com/story/violence-venezuela |archivedate=11 November 2013 |title=Violence in Venezuela |work=The Stream |publisher=Al Jazeera English |date=6 August 2011 |accessdate=14 April 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The Stream – Violence in Venezuela|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTTvZcuaJQQ|website=YouTube|publisher=Al Jazeera|accessdate=22 February 2015}}</ref>

====Prisons====
During Chávez's presidency, there were reports of prisoners having easy access to firearms, drugs, and alcohol. Carlos Nieto—head of Window to Freedom—alleges that heads of gangs acquire military weapons from the state, saying: "They have the types of weapons that can only be obtained by the country's armed forces. ... No one else has these." Use of internet and mobile phones are also a commonplace where criminals can take part in street crime while in prison. One prisoner explained how, "If the guards mess with us, we shoot them" and that he had "seen a man have his head cut off and people play [[Soccer|football]] with it".<ref>{{cite news|last=Gupta|first=Girish|title=In Venezuela's prisons, inmates are the wardens|url=http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/regions/americas/venezuela/120511/inside-violent-venezuelan-prison-la-planta|accessdate=20 April 2014|newspaper=Global Post|date=14 May 2012}}</ref>

Edgardo Lander, a sociologist and professor at the Central University of Venezuela with a PhD in sociology from Harvard University explained that Venezuelan prisons were "practically a school for criminals" since young inmates come out "more sort of trained and hardened than when they went in". He also explained that prisons are controlled by gangs and that "very little has been done" to control them.<ref>{{cite news|last=Jay|first=Paul|title=The Modern History of Venezuela, Why Still So Much Crime? – Edgardo Lander on Reality Asserts Itself (7/9)|url=http://therealnews.com/t2/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=31&Itemid=74&jumival=11760|accessdate=20 April 2014|newspaper=The Real News|date=19 April 2014}}</ref>

=== Elections under Chávez ===
[[File:Hugo-Chavéz Vota.jpg|thumb|Chávez voting in December 2007]]
The electoral processes surrounding Venezuela's democracy under Chávez were often observed controversially. According to [[Bloomberg News|''Bloomberg'']], he changed Venezuela from a democracy to "a largely [[authoritarian]] system".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/quicktake/venezuela-price-revolution|title=Venezuela's Collapse|date=14 May 2018|publisher=[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]]|access-date=22 May 2018|language=en}}</ref>

According to the cables, Hugo Chávez used "practically unlimited state resources" for propaganda activities, and high oil prices facilitated his success. The opposition, on the contrary, was divided into different parties, which ran for the same office, and the limited financial resources were badly invested. During his re-election campaigns, Chávez, through food, health, and literacy programs for the poor, handed money to prospective voters.<ref name=whywon /> He reportedly mobilized the lower class Venezuelan voters who had historically abstained from elections for years,<ref name=whywon/> providing both undocumented Venezuelans and foreigners with identity cards; 200,000 foreigners were naturalized before August 2004 and around 3,000–4,000 foreigners per year that might have been naturalized thereafter. Most of them purportedly voted for him.<ref name=whywon />

According to the same cable, Chávez had control over the CNE (National Electoral Council) "and, by extension, the international observer missions".<ref name=whywon/> Moreover, "The CNE's decision to use fingerprinting machines 'cazahuellas' to verify a voter's identity led to the widespread belief that a person's vote would not be secret".<ref name=whywon />

Finally, Chávez allegedly used the judiciary in order to detain or intimidate opposition politicians or NGOs accused of receiving money from the [[United States]] (through the National Endowment for Democracy – NED) purportedly in order to overthrow the government.<ref name=sumatedirec>{{cite web|url=https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/06CARACAS339_a.html|title=Sumate Directors Harassed, Facing Possible Detention|accessdate=3 August 2017|via=WikiLeaks PlusD}}</ref><ref name=genpetroleo>{{cite web|url=https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/04CARACAS2033_a.html|title=The Next Round of Arrests?|accessdate=3 August 2017|via=WikiLeaks PlusD}}</ref> According to the same source, the received money amounts to $30,000.<ref name=sumatedirec /> He reportedly also put pressure in the attorney general's office in order to replace three key employees and have any case that might damage the government or Chávez himself undisclosed.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/04CARACAS620_a.html|title=Advancing the Revlution: Bringing the Attorney General's Office T Heel|accessdate=3 August 2017|via=WikiLeaks PlusD}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/04CARACAS2702_a.html|title=Venezuelan Mayor Carpriles (still) Held for Trial|accessdate=3 August 2017|via=WikiLeaks PlusD}}</ref>

In December 1998, Hugo Chávez declared three goals for the new government; "convening a constituent assembly to write a new constitution, eliminating government corruption, and fighting against social exclusion and poverty". However, during Hugo Chávez's time in power, corruption has become widespread throughout the government due to impunity towards members of the government, bribes and the lack of transparency.<ref name=CATOhc>{{cite web|last=Coronel|first=Gustavo|title=Corruption, Mismanagement, and Abuse of Power in Hugo Chávez's Venezuela|url=http://www.cato.org/publications/development-policy-analysis/corruption-mismanagement-abuse-power-hugo-chavezs-venezuela|publisher=Cato Institute}}</ref> In 2004, Hugo Chávez and his allies took over the Supreme Court, filling it with supporters of Chávez and made new measures so the government could dismiss justices from the court.<ref name=HRW2012>{{cite web|title=World Report 2012: Venezuela|url=https://www.hrw.org/world-report-2012/world-report-2012-venezuela|work=Report|publisher=Human Rights Watch|accessdate=18 March 2014}}</ref> According to the [[libertarian]] ''[[Cato Institute]]'', the [[National Electoral Council of Venezuela]] was under control of Chávez where he tried to "push a constitutional reform that would have allowed him unlimited opportunities for reelection".<ref name=CATOcorruption>{{cite web|last=Coronel|first=Gustavo|title=The Corruption of Democracy in Venezuela|url=http://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/corruption-democracy-venezuela|publisher=Cato Institute|accessdate=18 March 2014}}</ref> The [[Corruption Perceptions Index]], produced annually by the Berlin-based NGO [[Transparency International]] (TNI), reported that in the later years of Chávez's tenure, corruption worsened; it was 158th out of 180 countries in 2008, and 165th out of 176 (tied with [[Burundi]], [[Chad]], and [[Haiti]]).<ref name=2012Index>{{cite news|title=Factbox: Transparency International's global corruption index|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/12/05/us-corruption-transparency-global-idUSBRE8B406G20121205|accessdate=5 December 2012|newspaper=Reuters|date=5 December 2012|first=David|last=Cutler}}</ref> Most Venezuelans believed the government's effort against corruption was ineffective; that corruption had increased; and that government institutions such as the judicial system, parliament, legislature, and police were the most corrupt.<ref>{{cite web|title=Global Corruption Barometer 2010/11|url=http://www.transparency.org/country#VEN_PublicOpinion|publisher=Transparency International|accessdate=26 February 2014}}</ref>

In [[Gallup Poll]]'s 2006 Corruption Index, Venezuela ranked 31st out of 101 countries according to how widespread the population perceive corruption as being in the government and in business. The index listed Venezuela as the second least corrupt nation in Latin America, behind Chile.<ref>{{cite web |first1=Steve |last1=Crabtree |first2=Nicole |last2=Naurath |url=http://www.hra.am/file/gallup_corruption.htm |title=Gallup Launches Worldwide Corruption Index |publisher=Gallup Poll News Service |accessdate=21 December 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071124180011/http://www.hra.am/file/gallup_corruption.htm |archivedate=24 November 2007}}</ref> Some criticism came from Chávez's supporters, as well. Chávez's own political party, [[Fifth Republic Movement]] (MVR), had been criticized as being riddled with the same cronyism, political patronage, and corruption that Chávez alleged were characteristic of the old "Fourth Republic" political parties. Venezuela's trade unionists and indigenous communities participated in peaceful demonstrations intended to impel the government to facilitate labor and land reforms. These communities, while largely expressing their sympathy and support for Chávez, criticized what they saw as Chávez's slow progress in protecting their interests against managers and mining concerns, respectively.<ref>Fuentes, F.

====Aiding FARC====
[[File:Raulreyesfarc.png|thumb|[[Raúl Reyes]]]]
According to the [[International Institute for Strategic Studies]] (IISS), "Chavez's government funded [[FARC]]'s office in Caracas and gave it access to Venezuela's intelligence services" and said that during the 2002 coup attempt that "FARC also responded to requests from [Venezuela's intelligence service] to provide training in urban terrorism involving targeted killings and the use of explosives". The IISS continued saying that "the archive offers tantalizing but ultimately unproven suggestions that FARC may have undertaken assassinations of Chavez's political opponents on behalf of the Venezuelan state". Venezuelan diplomats denounced the IISS' findings saying that they had "basic inaccuracies".<ref>{{cite news|last=Martinez|first=Michael|title=Study: Colombian rebels were willing to kill for Venezuela's Chavez|url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/americas/05/10/venezuela.farc.documents/index.html|accessdate=21 April 2014|newspaper=CNN|date=10 May 2011}}</ref>

In 2007, authorities in [[Colombia]] claimed that through laptops they had seized on a raid against [[Raúl Reyes]], they found in documents that Hugo Chávez offered payments of as much as $300&nbsp;million to the FARC "among other financial and political ties that date back years" along with other documents showing "high-level meetings have been held between rebels and Ecuadorean officials" and some documents claiming that FARC had "bought and sold [[uranium]]".<ref name="Padgett">{{cite news|last=Padgett|first=Tim|title=Chávez and the Cash-Filled Suitcase|url=http://content.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1838145,00.html|accessdate=28 March 2014|newspaper=TIME|date=3 September 2008}}</ref><ref name=USATODAYfarc>{{cite news|title=Colombia: Chavez funding FARC rebels|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/world/2008-03-02-venezuelacolombia_N.htm?csp=34|accessdate=21 April 2014|newspaper=USA Today|date=4 March 2008}}</ref>

In 2015, Chávez's former bodyguard [[Leamsy Salazar]] stated in ''Bumerán Chávez'' that Chávez met with the high command of FARC in 2007 somewhere in rural Venezuela. Chávez created a system in which the FARC would provide the Venezuelan government with drugs that would be transported in live cattle and the FARC would receive money and weaponry from the Venezuelan government. According to Salazar, this was done in order to weaken Colombian President [[Álvaro Uribe]], an enemy of Chávez.<ref name=ROTTENstate>{{cite news|last1=Cristóbal Nagel|first1=Juan|title=Something Is Rotten in the State of Venezuela|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2015/04/28/something-is-rotten-in-the-state-of-venezuela-chavez-maduro-cabello-salazar-farc/|accessdate=17 May 2015|agency=[[Foreign Policy]]|date=28 April 2015}}</ref>

====1999 Venezuelan Constitution====
In the 1999 [[Constitution of Venezuela|Venezuelan constitution]], 116 of the 350 articles were concerned with human rights; these included increased protections for indigenous peoples and women, and established the rights of the public to education, housing, healthcare, and food. It called for dramatic democratic reforms such as ability to recall politicians from office by popular referendum, increased requirements for government transparency, and numerous other requirements to increase localized, participatory democracy, in favor of centralized administration. It gave citizens the right to timely and impartial information, community access to media, and a right to participate in acts of civil disobedience.<ref name="new-const">[[#Wil03|Wilpert 2003]].</ref><ref name="Embassy of Venezuela in the US">{{cite web|year = 2000|title = Bolivarian Constitution of Venezuela|url = http://www.embavenez-us.org/constitution/intro.htm|accessdate = 30 December 2006|publisher = Embassy of Venezuela in the US|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120717012249/http://www.embavenez-us.org/constitution/intro.htm|archive-date = 17 July 2012|url-status = dead}}</ref>

===Media and the press===
[[File:ProtestosRCTV.jpg|200px|thumbnail|right|Venezuelans protesting against the closing of RCTV]]
Under Chávez, press freedom declined while [[censorship in Venezuela]] increased. He used state-run bodies to silence the media and to disseminate [[Bolivarian propaganda]]. Other actions included pressuring media organizations to sell to those related to his government or to face closure.<ref name=":02">{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/as-it-slides-toward-authoritarianism-venezuela-targets-one-of-its-last-independent-newspapers/2018/07/03/9cb5fe22-7a2d-11e8-ac4e-421ef7165923_story.html|title=As it slides toward authoritarianism, Venezuela targets one of its last independent newspapers|date=5 July 2018|website=[[The Washington Post]]|language=en|access-date=6 July 2018}}</ref>

| quote = Venezuela’s hybrid regime, after Chávez’s death, became more selectively accommodating on the inside and more explicitly repressive on the outside. This allowed the regime to survive, but not to thrive. Regime survival was purchased at the cost of policy immobilism. And policy immobilism has left Venezuela with the deepest economic crisis in Venezuela’s history.
