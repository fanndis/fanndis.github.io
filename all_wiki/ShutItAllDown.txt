'''ShutItAllDown''' is a wave of ongoing Gender Based Violence protests across [[Namibia]] aimed at stopping the spread of rape and killing of women. The protests which began on 6 October followed the killing of 22 year old Shannon Wasserfall whose remains were reportedly found buried in a shallow grave near [[Walvis Bay]], 6 months after she went missing.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.essence.com/feature/shut-it-all-down-shannon-wasserfall-namibia/|title=Police Use Tear Gas To Disperse Gender-Based Violence Protests|website= essence.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.trtworld.com/africa/dozens-arrested-in-namibia-s-anti-femicide-protests-40467|title=Dozens arrested in Namibia's anti-femicide protests|website=trtworld.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.africanews.com/2020/10/11/namibia-police-disperse-gender-based-violence-protest/ |website=Africanews|title=&#124; Namibia: Police Disperse Gender-Based Violence Protest}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://citizen.co.za/news/news-africa/2368953/namibian-anti-femicide-protesters-met-with-teargas/|title= Namibian anti-femicide protesters met with teargas |website=The Citizen}}</ref>

==Background==
On 10 April 2020, 21 year old Shannon Wasserfall went missing in the coastal town of Walvis Bay. Following her disappearance, communities rallied together using social media in search of her. After 6 months of her disappearance, her father received an announymous text message informing him that his daughter was buried in a grave kilometres away from the town. He later informed the Namibia Police who went to dig out the remains. Two days later, one woman and her boyfriend were arrested in connection to Wasserfall's murder.

Young people used the hashtag #ShutItAllDown to mobilise themselves on social media platform [[Twitter]] and took to the streets to denounce Gender Based Violence.<ref>https://www.namibian.com.na/95436/read/Devastated-community-marches-for-Shannon-Wasserfall | Devastated community marches for Shannon Wasserfall - The Namibian</ref>

This followed an almost violent confrontation between protesters and the police alongside the Sam Nujoma Drive in the Windhoek City Centre. The arrested protesters took to social media to decry police treatment. They were later charged and released. On Monday 12 October they appeared before the Windhoek Margistrates Court where several protesters joined them to continue the protests.<ref>https://www.namibian.com.na/95528/read/Anti-GBV-protests-draw-international-concern | Anti-GBV protests draw international concern - The Namibian</ref>
