'''Orcas Island''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɔːr|k|ə|s}}) is the largest of the [[San Juan Islands]] of the [[Pacific Northwest]], which are located in the northwestern corner of [[Washington state]] in [[San Juan County, Washington]], [[United States]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.visitsanjuans.com/about-the-islands/orcas-island|title=Orcas Island|date=2015-05-24|work=San Juan Islands Washington Visitors Bureau {{!}} Orcas Island {{!}} Lopez Island {{!}} Friday Harbor {{!}} San Juan Island|access-date=2017-08-17|language=en}}</ref>

==History and naming of the island==
The name "Orcas" is a shortened form of ''Horcasitas,'' or [[Juan Vicente de Güemes Padilla Horcasitas y Aguayo, 2nd Count of Revillagigedo]], the Viceroy of Mexico who sent an exploration expedition under [[Francisco de Eliza]] to the Pacific Northwest in 1791. During the voyage, Eliza explored part of the San Juan Islands. He did not apply the name Orcas specifically to Orcas Island, but rather to part of the archipelago. In 1847, [[Henry Kellett]] assigned the name Orcas to Orcas Island during his reorganization of the British Admiralty charts. Kellett's work eliminated the patriotically American names that [[Charles Wilkes]] had given to many features of the San Juans during the [[United States Exploring Expedition|Wilkes Expedition]] of 1838–1842. Wilkes had named Orcas Island "Hull Island", after Commodore [[Isaac Hull]]. Other features of Orcas Island named by Wilkes include "Ironsides Inlet" for East Sound and "Guerrier Bay" for [[West Sound, Washington|West Sound]].  One of the names Wilkes gave remains: Mount Constitution. Wilkes' names follow a pattern: Isaac Hull was the commander of "Old Ironsides" (the ''{{USS|Constitution}}'') and won fame after capturing the British warship ''[[HMS Guerriere (1806)|Guerriere]]'' in the War of 1812.<ref>{{cite book |last= Phillips |first= James W. |title= Washington State Place Names |url= https://archive.org/details/washingtonstatep00phil |url-access= registration |year= 1971 |publisher= University of Washington Press |isbn= 0-295-95158-3}}</ref> The islands were first claimed by Spain, then by Britain, who agreed that all below the 49th parallel was part of the US, in the treaty signed after the War of 1812. The Oregon territory, which then included Washington state and this island, was used jointly by the US and Britain until 1848, but border disputes specifically concerning the [[San Juan Islands#History|San Juan Islands]], including the [[Pig War (1859)]], were not settled until 1871.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/sajh/historyculture/the-pig-war.htm|title=The Pig War - San Juan Island|website=National Park Service|access-date=16 August 2017}}</ref> The similarity to the name of the [[orca]], which is popularly associated with coastal Washington state, is coincidental.

==Geography==
With a land area of 57.3 square miles (148.4&nbsp;km²) and a population of 5,387 ([[2010 United States Census|2010 census]]), Orcas Island is slightly larger, but less populous, than neighboring [[San Juan Island]]. Orcas is shaped like a pair of saddlebags, separated by [[fjord]]-like Eastsound, and 2 prominent bays, Westsound and Deer Harbor, on the southwest side. At the northern end of the island is the village of [[Eastsound, Washington|Eastsound]], the largest population center on Orcas and the second largest in San Juan County. 

Other, smaller hamlets on the island include [[Orcas Village, Washington|Orcas Landing]] (where the [[Washington State Ferries|inter-island/mainland ferry]] lands), [[West Sound, Washington|West Sound]] (with [[Eastsound, Washington|Eastsound]] addresses), [[Deer Harbor, Washington|Deer Harbor]], Rosario (with [[Eastsound, Washington|Eastsound]] addresses), [[Olga, Washington|Olga]] and [[Doe Bay, Washington|Doe Bay]]. There are a number of former settlements that no longer exist, which were mostly built up around the lime kiln and fruit growing industries.

==Island access== 
The state supports island access through the [[Washington State Ferries]] system.  In addition, the island can be accessed through a variety of air, seaplane and sea charter services. Private watercraft can use public docks located near the villages around the island, and various public shoreline access points. During the summer season, there is an island shuttle van that runs from the ferry landing to Eastsound and other points.

==Museums==
* The Orcas Island Historical Museum is located down town Eastsound and is the only object-based, interpretive heritage facility for the island, with a permanent collection containing approximately 6000 objects, paper documents and photographs.
