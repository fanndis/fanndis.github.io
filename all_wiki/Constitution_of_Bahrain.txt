{{Politics of Bahrain}}
[[Bahrain]] has had two '''[[constitution]]s''' in its modern history. The first one was promulgated in 1973, and the second one in 2002.

==1973 Constitution==
{{main|1973 Constitution of Bahrain}}
The constitution of 1973 was written shortly after Bahrain's independence from [[United Kingdom|Britain]] in 1971. In 1972, the then ruler Shaikh [[Isa bin Salman Al Khalifa]] issued a [[Amiri decree|decree]] providing for the election of a Constituent Assembly to draft and ratify a constitution. The electorate of the constituent assembly was native-born male citizens aged twenty years or older. The Constituent Assembly consisted of twenty-two elected delegates, plus the twelve members of the Council of Ministers and eight members directly appointed by Shaikh Isa.<ref name="FRD">[https://books.google.com/books?id=OsSPaxEpUS4C&lpg=PP1&pg=PA97#v=onepage&q&f=false Bahrain], [[Federal Research Division]], 2004, [[Kessinger Publishing]], pp 97 - 98</ref>

The draft constitution provided for a [[unicameral]] legislature (the [[National Assembly of Bahrain|National Assembly]]) consisting of 44 members, 30 elected by "universal suffrage" (though franchise was restricted to males), plus 14 royally-appointed government ministers who were [[ex officio member]]s. The constitution was enacted by decree in December 1973.<ref name="FRD" />

The [[1973 Bahraini general election]] was the only election held under the 1973 Constitution, before it was abrogated by Shaikh Isa in 1975. The country was governed under emergency laws from 1975 to 2002.<ref name="FRD" />

== 2002 Constitution ==
{{wikisourcepar|Constitution of the Kingdom of Bahrain (2002)}}
After the death of the Amir Shaikh Isa bin Salman Al Khalifa in 1999, his throne was taken over by his son Shaikh [[Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa]]. Seeking to bring an end to the [[1990s uprising in Bahrain]], he announced a new set of democratic reforms, including a promise to return to constitutional rule.

In 2001 Emir Hamad put forward the [[National Action Charter of Bahrain|National Action Charter]] which would return the country to constitutional rule. However the opposition was opposed to the Charter's call for an amendment to the 1973 Constitution, changing the legislature from [[unicameral]] to [[bicameral]]. The Charter stated that "the legislature will consist of two chambers, namely one that is constituted through free, direct elections whose mandate will be to enact laws, and a second one that would have people with experience and expertise who would give advice as necessary." The opposition groups argued this statement to be too ambiguous, and remained opposed to the Charter. Also as part of the new Constitution the country was raised in status from an Emirate to a Kingdom.

Emir Hamad responded by holding a highly publicised meeting with the spiritual leaders of the Shia Islamist opposition. He signed a document clarifying that only the elected lower house of the parliament would have legislative power, while the appointed upper house would have a strictly advisory role. Upon this assurance, the main opposition groups accepted the Charter and called for a 'Yes' vote in the national referendum. The Charter was accepted in the 2001 referendum with 98.4% voting 'Yes' for it.

However, in 2002 Emir (now King) Hamad promulgated the 2002 Constitution, without any public consultation, in which both the elected and the royally-appointed chambers of parliament were given equal legislative powers, going back on his public promise of 2001. As a result, the [[2002 Bahraini general election|parliamentary elections]] due to be held later that year were boycotted by four political societies; [[Al Wefaq]], a Shia Islamist group, thought to be the most popular political society in the country, [[National Democratic Action]], the largest Leftist political society, [[Islamic Action Society]], a marginal Shia Islamist society, and the [[Nationalist Democratic Rally Society]], a marginal Arab Nationalist society.

==Executive branch==
{{See also|Cabinet of Bahrain}}
According to [[Wikisource:Constitution of the Kingdom of Bahrain (2002)#Article 32 .5BSeparation of Powers.5D|Article 32 (b)]] of the [[Constitution of Bahrain#Constitution of 2002|2002 Constitution]], "executive authority is vested in the [[King of Bahrain|King]] together with the Council of Ministers and Ministers". The Council of Ministers ([[Cabinet (government)|Cabinet]]) is appointed directly by the King (Article 33d).

Bahrain has had only one [[Prime Minister of Bahrain|Prime Minister]] since the country's independence in 1971, [[Khalifah ibn Sulman al-Khalifah]], the uncle of the reigning King [[Hamad ibn Isa al-Khalifah]]. As of 2010, roughly half of the cabinet ministers have been selected from the [[Al Khalifa family|Al Khalifa royal family]],<ref>[http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2010/03/2010356756685605.html Bahrain Shia demand cabinet change], [[Aljazeera.net]], 5 March 2010</ref> including the Minister of Defence, Minister of Interior, Minister of Foreign Affairs, Minister of Finance, and Minister of Justice and Islamic Affairs.

===Political societies and elections===
{{elect|List of political parties in Bahrain|Elections in Bahrain}}
Political parties are illegal in Bahrain, de facto political parties operate and are known as 'political societies'

==Judicial branch==
{{main|Judiciary of Bahrain}}
The Judiciary of Bahrain is divided into two branches: the Civil Law Courts and the Shari'a Law Courts. The Civil Law Courts deal with all commercial, civil, and criminal cases, as well disputes related to the [[personal status]] of non-Muslims. The Shariâ€™a Law Courts have jurisdiction over all issues related to the personal status of Muslims.<ref name="POGAR">{{cite web| title =Country Theme: Judiciary: Bahrain| publisher =[[United Nations Development Program|UNDP]]-Programme on Governance in the Arab Region| url =http://www.undp-pogar.org/countries/theme.aspx?cid=2&t=9| accessdate =2011-010-02| archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20120307132123/http://www.undp-pogar.org/countries/theme.aspx?t=9&cid=2| archive-date =2012-03-07| url-status =dead}}</ref>

Judges of the middle and lower courts are nominated by the Ministry of Justice and appointed by decree by the [[Prime Minister of Bahrain|prime minister]]. The Supreme Judicial Council, chaired by the [[King of Bahrain|King]], appoints the members of the Constitutional Court.<ref name="POGAR" />

Many of the high-ranking judges in Bahrain are either members of the [[Al Khalifa|ruling family]] or non-Bahrainis (mainly Egyptians) with 2-year renewable contracts. To secure renewal of these contracts, judges may be prone to consider it necessary to take decisions not unfavourable to the wishes or interests of the Government.<ref>{{cite news|title=Attacks on Justice 2002 - Bahrain|url=http://www.icj.org/download/database/pdf/bahrain.pdf|newspaper=[[International Commission of Jurists]]|date=22 August 2003|access-date=26 May 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120403024422/http://www.icj.org/download/database/pdf/bahrain.pdf|archive-date=3 April 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>
