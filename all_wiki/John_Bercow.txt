'''John Simon Bercow''' {{Post-nominals|country=UK|PC}} ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|ɜr|k|oʊ}}<!-- Please review [[Help:IPA for English]] before changing -->; born 19 January 1963)<ref>{{cite news|url=https://membership.theguardian.com/event/john-bercow-in-conversation-86799360223|title=John Bercow in conversation|newspaper=The Guardian|access-date=12 January 2020}}</ref> is a British politician who served as [[Speaker of the House of Commons (United Kingdom)|Speaker of the House of Commons]] from 2009 to 2019, and as [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] (MP) for [[Buckingham (UK Parliament constituency)|Buckingham]] between 1997 and 2019. He was the first MP who was elected Speaker without previously serving as a Deputy Speaker since [[Selwyn Lloyd]] in 1971. Prior to his election as Speaker, he was a [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] MP.

He served as a councillor in the [[London Borough of Lambeth]] from 1986 to 1990 and unsuccessfully contested parliamentary seats in the [[UK general election, 1987|1987]] and [[UK general election, 1992|1992 general elections]], before being elected for Buckingham in 1997. Promoted to the [[Shadow Cabinet]] in 2001, Bercow held posts under [[Iain Duncan Smith]] and [[Michael Howard]]. In November 2002, he resigned over a dispute concerning his support for [[Adoption and Children Act 2002|same-sex adoption]], but returned a year later, only to be dismissed from the Shadow Cabinet in 2004. Having initially been strongly associated with the [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]] faction of his party, his views shifted over time; by 2009 there were rumours that he would defect to the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], although Bercow denied these.<ref name="jbstory"/>

Following the resignation of Speaker [[Michael Martin, Baron Martin of Springburn|Michael Martin]] in June 2009, Bercow stood in the [[2009 Speaker of the British House of Commons election|election to replace him]] and was successful. He went on to be re-elected Speaker unopposed at the start of the new Parliaments in 2010, 2015 and 2017.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-32784978 |title=John Bercow to continue as Commons Speaker with MPs' backing |work=BBC News |date=18 May 2015 |access-date=18 May 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150521010040/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-32784978 |archive-date=21 May 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref> This made him the first Speaker since the [[Second World War]] to have been elected four times, as well as the first since then to have served alongside four Prime Ministers.<ref>{{cite news |last1=McGillivray |first1=Kate |last2=Vartanian |first2=Talin |date=4 October 2019 |title=Speaker John Bercow reflects on 10 years of keeping British parliamentarians in line |url=https://www.cbc.ca/radio/thesundayedition/the-sunday-edition-for-october-6-2019-1.5308786/speaker-john-bercow-reflects-on-10-years-of-keeping-british-parliamentarians-in-line-1.5308791 |access-date=22 October 2019 |quote=After being elected for four consecutive terms as Speaker, and serving under four prime ministers, Bercow is exiting at a time of high drama and tension in the U.K. |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191021191801/https://www.cbc.ca/radio/thesundayedition/the-sunday-edition-for-october-6-2019-1.5308786/speaker-john-bercow-reflects-on-10-years-of-keeping-british-parliamentarians-in-line-1.5308791 |archive-date=21 October 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Tominey |first=Camilla |date=9 September 2019 |title=John Bercow: the Speaker dogged by claims of bullying and bias who was a thorn in the side of his own party |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2019/09/09/john-bercow-speaker-became-thorn-side-party/ |access-date=22 October 2019 |quote=Bercow is the longest-serving Speaker since Edward FitzRoy served 15 years in post between 1928 and 1943, and the first Speaker since FitzRoy to serve under four Prime Ministers. |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191022162228/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2019/09/09/john-bercow-speaker-became-thorn-side-party/ |archive-date=22 October 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> In September 2019, Bercow declared that he would stand down as Commons Speaker and MP on 31 October; he remained Speaker until being appointed to the [[Manor of Northstead]] on 4 November 2019.<ref>Rowena Mason [https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/09/john-bercow-to-step-down-as-speaker-by-31-october "John Bercow to step down as Speaker by 31 October"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190930172235/https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/09/john-bercow-to-step-down-as-speaker-by-31-october |date=30 September 2019 }}, ''The Guardian'', 9 September 2019</ref> Having served 10 years as Speaker, Bercow became the longest-serving Speaker since [[Edward FitzRoy]], who served nearly 15 years in post between 1928 and 1943.

After graduating from the University of Essex, Bercow was elected as the last national chairman of the [[Federation of Conservative Students]] (FCS), 1986–87.<ref name="Essex"/> The FCS was then broken up by the [[chairman of the Conservative Party]], [[Norman Tebbit]], after one of its members had accused previous Tory PM [[Harold Macmillan]] of [[war crimes]] in [[Repatriation of Cossacks after World War II|extraditing Cossacks to the Soviet Union]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=yapWAAAAIBAJ&pg=4507,3865568|title=Tories sue student editor over Macmillan war crimes charges|author=John Stevens|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|page=9|date=21 August 1986}}</ref> Bercow attracted the attention of the Conservative leadership, and in 1987 he was appointed by Tebbit as vice-chairman of the [[Conservative Collegiate Forum]] (the successor organisation of the FCS) to head the campaign for student support in the run-up to the [[1987 United Kingdom general election|1987 general election]].

After a spell in [[merchant banking]], Bercow joined the lobbying firm Rowland Sallingbury Casey (part of [[Saatchi & Saatchi]]) in 1988, becoming a board director within five years. With fellow Conservative [[Julian Lewis (MP)|Julian Lewis]], Bercow ran an advanced speaking and campaigning course for over 10 years, which trained over 600 Conservatives (including several current MPs) in campaigning and communication techniques.

== Political career ==
=== Councillor ===
In 1986, Bercow was elected as a Conservative councillor in the [[London Borough of Lambeth]], and served for four years representing the [[St Leonard's (ward)|Streatham, St Leonard's]] ward. In 1987, he was appointed the youngest deputy group leader in the United Kingdom.<ref name="johnbercowstory">{{cite news|last=Wheeler|first=Brian|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8114399.stm|title=The John Bercow story|work=BBC News|date=24 June 2009|access-date=30 November 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170829211602/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8114399.stm|archive-date=29 August 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

=== Special adviser ===
In 1995, Bercow was appointed as a [[Special advisers (UK government)|special adviser]] to the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, [[Jonathan Aitken]]. After Aitken's resignation to fight a libel action, Bercow served as a special adviser to the Secretary of State for National Heritage, [[Virginia Bottomley]].

=== Parliamentary career ===
[[File:John Bercow Senate of Poland 02.JPG|thumb|right|Bercow in [[Poland]] in 2010]]
Bercow was an unsuccessful Conservative candidate in the [[1987 United Kingdom general election|1987 general election]] in [[Motherwell South (UK Parliament constituency)|Motherwell South]], and again at the [[1992 United Kingdom general election|1992 general election]] in [[Bristol South (UK Parliament constituency)|Bristol South]]. In 1996 he paid £1,000 to charter a helicopter so that he could attend the selection meetings for two safe Conservative parliamentary seats on the same day – [[Buckingham (UK Parliament constituency)|Buckingham]] and [[Surrey Heath (UK Parliament constituency)|Surrey Heath]] – and was selected as the candidate for Buckingham. He has referred to the hiring of the helicopter as "the best £1,000 I have ever spent".<ref name="johnbercowstory"/>

Bercow was first elected to parliament in the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997 general election]] as the MP for Buckingham with a majority of 12,386. He then increased his majority at the [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001 general election]] being elected by a margin of 18,129 votes. He was re-elected at the [[2005 United Kingdom general election|2005 general election]], but with a reduced majority of 12,529.

Bercow rose quickly through the opposition's junior offices. He was appointed a frontbench spokesman for Education and Employment in June 1999, and then a frontbench spokesman for Home Affairs in July 2000, before being brought into the shadow cabinet in 2001 by the Conservative leader [[Iain Duncan Smith]]. He served as Shadow [[Chief Secretary to the Treasury]] from September 2001 to July 2002, and as Shadow [[Department for Work and Pensions|Minister for Work and Pensions]] from July to November 2002.

=== Opposition MP of the Year ===
In 2005, Bercow won the Channel Four/Hansard Society Political Award for 'Opposition MP of the Year'. He said:
<blockquote>In addition to pursuing a wide variety of local issues, I have attempted to question, probe and scrutinise the Government in the House of Commons on important national and international topics which concern people. Over the last 12 months, I have constantly pressed the case for reform of world trade rules to give the poorest people on the planet a chance to sell their products and improve their quality of life. The plight of the people of Darfur, Western Sudan, has also been a regular theme. They have suffered too much for too long with too little done about the situation. I shall go on arguing for Britain to take the lead in the international community in seeking decisive action for peace and justice.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.buckinghamconservative.co.uk/ourmp_opposition.htm|title=Opposition MP of the Year for 2005|work=Buckingham Conservative Association|date=8 February 2005|access-date=24 November 2007}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref></blockquote>

=== Rumours of defection ===
Following the defection of Conservative MP [[Quentin Davies]] to the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] in June 2007, there were persistent rumours that Bercow was likely to be the next Conservative MP to leave the party.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://conservativehome.blogs.com/torydiary/2007/07/bercow-defectio.html|title=Bercow defection is expected at time of maximum embarrassment|work=ConservativeHome.com|date=14 July 2007|access-date=24 November 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927123235/http://conservativehome.blogs.com/torydiary/2007/07/bercow-defectio.html|archive-date=27 September 2011|url-status=live}}</ref>

Bercow did not defect to Labour, but in September 2007, accepted an advisory post on [[Gordon Brown]]'s government's review of support for children with speech, language and communication special needs. The Conservative Party chairman, [[Caroline Spelman]], confirmed that this appointment was with the consent of the Conservative Party.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/6975708.stm|title=Mercer and Bercow to advise Brown|work=BBC News|date=3 September 2007|access-date=24 November 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170905170145/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/6975708.stm|archive-date=5 September 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> Bercow had a long-term interest in this topic, as his son Oliver has been diagnosed with [[autism]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080201/debtext/80201-0004.htm|title=House of Commons Hansard Debates for 1 Feb 2008 (pt 0004)|publisher=Parliament of the United Kingdom|date=1 February 2008|access-date=30 November 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101015031445/http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080201/debtext/80201-0004.htm|archive-date=15 October 2010|url-status=live}}</ref>

=== Bercow review ===
In 2008, Bercow was asked by Labour cabinet members [[Ed Balls]] and [[Alan Johnson]] to produce a substantial review of children and families affected by speech, language and communication needs (SLCN). After the report, the government pledged £52&nbsp;million to raise the profile of SLCN within the education field.

The review looks at the extreme consequences to which communication problems can lead; from initial frustration at not being able to express oneself, to bullying or being bullied at school, fewer job prospects and even a descent into criminality.<ref name="DCSF_main">{{cite web | url = http://www.dcsf.gov.uk/slcnaction/bercow-review.shtml | title = The Bercow Review | access-date = 11 February 2011 | url-status=dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100610094142/http://www.dcsf.gov.uk/slcnaction/bercow-review.shtml | archive-date = 10 June 2010 | df = dmy-all }}</ref><ref name="Bercow_Report">{{cite book | last1 = Bercow | first1 = John | title = The Bercow Report | publisher = Department for Education (UK) | year = 2008 | url = http://www.education.gov.uk/publications/standard/publicationdetail/page1/DCSF-00632-2008 | access-date = 11 February 2011 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110207134847/https://www.education.gov.uk/publications/standard/publicationDetail/Page1/DCSF-00632-2008 | archive-date = 7 February 2011 | url-status = live }}</ref>

The interim report highlighted a number of core issues: that speech, language and communication are not only essential life skills but fundamental human rights; that early identification of problems and intervention is important to avoid social problems later on; and that the current system of treatment is patchy, i.e. there is a need for services to be continually provided for children and families from an early age.<ref name="DCSF_interim_press">{{cite web | url = http://www.dcsf.gov.uk/pns/DisplayPN.cgi?pn_id=2008_0056 | title = Bercow Review: Speech, Language & Communication Services for Children and Young People Must Improve | access-date = 11 February 2011 | publisher = Department for Children, Schools and Families | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20101008190852/http://www.dcsf.gov.uk/pns/DisplayPN.cgi?pn_id=2008_0056 | archive-date = 8 October 2010 | url-status = live }}</ref><ref name="interim_report2008">{{cite book | last1 = Bercow | first1 = John | title = Bercow Review of Services for Children and Young people (0–19) with Speech, Language and Communication Needs – Interim Report | publisher = Department for Education (UK) | year = 2008 | url = http://www.education.gov.uk/publications/standard/publicationdetail/page1/D16-7520-0308 | access-date = 11 February 2011 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110207172420/https://www.education.gov.uk/publications/standard/publicationDetail/Page1/D16-7520-0308 | archive-date = 7 February 2011 | url-status = live }}</ref>

=== Role in expenses scandal ===
Until 2008/09 Bercow usually claimed the maximum available amount for the 'Additional Costs Allowance' to pay for the cost of staying away from his main home. In 2007/08 and 2008/09 his total expenses were amongst the lowest claimed by MPs (coming 631st and 640th, respectively, out of 645 and 647).{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}

During the [[United Kingdom parliamentary expenses scandal|2009 expenses scandal]], it was revealed that Bercow changed the designation of his second home on more than one occasion – meaning that he avoided paying [[capital gains tax]] on the sale of two properties. He also claimed just under £1,000 to hire an accountant to fill in his tax returns. Bercow denied any wrongdoing, but agreed to pay £6,508 to cover any tax that he may have had to pay to HM Revenue and Customs.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/mps-expenses/5606352/Speaker-election-John-Bercows-expenses-claims-back-in-spotlight.html|work=The Daily Telegraph|title=Speaker election: John Bercow's expenses claims back in spotlight|first=Gordon|last=Rayner|date=23 June 2009|access-date=6 May 2010|location=London|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100430161543/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/mps-expenses/5606352/Speaker-election-John-Bercows-expenses-claims-back-in-spotlight.html|archive-date=30 April 2010|url-status=live}}</ref>

It was revealed in 2014 that the House of Commons authorities had destroyed all evidence of MPs' expenses claims prior to 2010. Bercow faced accusations that he had presided over what had been dubbed a "fresh cover-up" of the expenses scandal.<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/mps-expenses/11204405/MPs-to-escape-expenses-investigations-after-paperwork-destroyed-by-Parliament.html MPs to escape expenses investigations after paperwork destroyed by Parliament] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180327051420/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/mps-expenses/11204405/MPs-to-escape-expenses-investigations-after-paperwork-destroyed-by-Parliament.html |date=27 March 2018 }}, Matthew Holehouse, ''The Daily Telegraph'', 20 November 2014</ref>

In July 2015, Bercow was again criticised for the amount of his expenses, including a claim of £172 for a 0.7-mile chauffeur-driven journey. Andy Silvester, campaign director at the [[TaxPayers' Alliance]], said: "This is an obscene waste of money and shows appalling judgment from whoever made the arrangements."<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/mps-expenses/conservative-mps-expenses/11760106/Speaker-John-Bercow-claims-172-for-0.7-mile-journey.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Michael | last=Wilkinson | title=George Osborne's deputy slams John Bercow for claiming £172 for 0.7-mile journey | date=24 July 2015 | access-date=2 April 2018 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170730231616/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/mps-expenses/conservative-mps-expenses/11760106/Speaker-John-Bercow-claims-172-for-0.7-mile-journey.html | archive-date=30 July 2017 | url-status=live }}</ref>

In the first round of the election on 22 June, Bercow received 179 votes – more than any other candidate, but short of the majority required for victory.

Bercow's election as Speaker was controversial because he is believed to have had the support of very few MPs from his former party.{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}} Conservative MPs generally viewed Bercow with distrust because of his changing political views (having moved over the years from being very right-wing to become more socially liberal, leading to clashes with past party leaders),{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}} his acceptance of an advisory role from the Labour government (a party he had often been rumoured to be on the verge of joining),{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}} his general lack of good relations with fellow MPs from the Conservatives,{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}} and his vigorous campaigning for the Speaker's job.{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}} Thought{{by whom|date=September 2019}} to have received the votes of as few as three of his fellow Conservative MPs,{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}} he succeeded on the back of a large number of Labour votes, many MPs being driven by the perception that Michael Martin had been hounded out of the job and wanting his replacement to be someone who was not a Conservative Party favourite.<ref>[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article6565099.ece Farewell to tights as new Speaker John Bercow presides over Commons], ''The Times'', 24 June 2009</ref><ref>[http://www.economist.com/world/britain/displaystory.cfm?story_id=13919553 Laws, sausages, speakers] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090629105514/http://www.economist.com/world/britain/displaystory.cfm?story_id=13919553 |date=29 June 2009 }}, ''The Economist'', 25 June 2009</ref>

==== Speaker's residence refurbishment ====
Within weeks of taking office as Speaker, Bercow ordered a redecoration and refurbishment of the Speaker's [[grace and favour]] apartment in the Palace of Westminster, partly with the objective of making it child-friendly; the work cost £20,659 and was paid for by Parliament. It followed extensive work on the apartment under the previous Speaker.<ref name=telegraph>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/mps-expenses/5974009/MPs-expenses-speaker-John-Bercows-20000-bill-for-apartment.html|work=The Daily Telegraph|title=MPs' expenses: speaker John Bercow's £20,000 bill for apartment|first=Andrew|last=Porter|date=4 August 2009|access-date=6 May 2010|location=London|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100521052004/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/mps-expenses/5974009/MPs-expenses-speaker-John-Bercows-20000-bill-for-apartment.html|archive-date=21 May 2010|url-status=live}}</ref>

==== Youth Parliament ====
In October 2009, Bercow chaired the [[United Kingdom Youth Parliament]]'s first annual sitting in the [[House of Commons]], making them the only group except members of parliament to sit in the chamber. He chaired every subsequent sitting and attended every annual conference until his resignation in 2019, addressing and supporting Members of Youth Parliament from across the UK.

=== 2010 general election and second term ===
The Speaker of the House of Commons is traditionally seen as outside party politics, and is often not challenged by the main parties at general elections, including the [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010 general election]]. In September 2009, [[Nigel Farage]] resigned his leadership of the [[UK Independence Party]] (UKIP) to stand for Bercow's Buckingham seat, asserting, "This man represents all that is wrong with British politics today. He was embroiled in the expenses saga and he presides over a Parliament that virtually does nothing."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spectator.co.uk/coffeehouse/5304556/farage-to-stand-against-bercow.thtml|title=Farage to stand against Bercow|work=The Spectator|access-date=30 November 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605035252/http://www.spectator.co.uk/coffeehouse/5304556/farage-to-stand-against-bercow.thtml|archive-date=5 June 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/farage-to-stand-against-speaker-bercow-1781152.html|work=The Independent|title=Farage to stand against speaker Bercow|first=Jon|last=Smith|date=3 September 2009|access-date=6 May 2010|location=London|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090906083236/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/farage-to-stand-against-speaker-bercow-1781152.html|archive-date=6 September 2009|url-status=live}}</ref> [[John Stevens (English politician)|John Stevens]], another candidate, found support for his campaign from the former Independent MP [[Martin Bell]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/in-buckingham-the-bell-tolls-for-blair-1946381.html|title=In Buckingham, the Bell tolls for Blair|work=The Independent|access-date=20 April 2010|date=16 April 2010|location=London|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100418073833/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/in-buckingham-the-bell-tolls-for-blair-1946381.html|archive-date=18 April 2010|url-status=live}}</ref> Bercow also faced opposition from the [[British National Party]] and the [[Christian Party (UK)|Christian Party]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/shared/election2010/results/constituency/a79.stm|work=BBC News|title=Buckingham|access-date=6 May 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100503195304/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/shared/election2010/results/constituency/a79.stm|archive-date=3 May 2010|url-status=live}}</ref>

As Bercow lacked a party endorsement and therefore a campaign team, he sought to build one. A group of his supporters known as 'Friends of Speaker Bercow' solicited donations for the campaign, aiming to raise £40,000. When one of their letters was received by a member of UKIP, the recipient referred it to the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards, complaining that it appeared that Bercow's fundraising campaign was operating from the Speaker's Office, which is required to remain politically neutral.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article7040324.ece|work=The Times|title=Complaint over fundraising letter from Friends of Speaker Bercow|date=25 February 2010|access-date=6 May 2010|first1=Suzy|last1=Jagger|first2=Tom|last2=Baldwin|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604230202/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article7040324.ece|archive-date=4 June 2011|url-status=live}}</ref> The Commissioner declined to launch an investigation because of the lack of evidence.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bucksherald.co.uk/generalelection/No-inquiry-into-actions-of.6155541.jp|title=No inquiry into actions of Friends of Speaker Bercow|work=Bucks Herald|access-date=30 November 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100323032327/http://www.bucksherald.co.uk/generalelection/No-inquiry-into-actions-of.6155541.jp|archive-date=23 March 2010|url-status=live}}</ref>

==== Speaker's Lectures ====
To mark the centenary of the [[Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949|Parliament Act 1911]], Bercow commissioned a series of lectures about the main political figures of the century. The [[Speaker's Lectures]] continue with a variety of topics such as historic parliamentarians and current affairs.

=== 2015 general election and third term ===
Bercow was returned as an MP in the [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015 general election]]. The election was notable for the 1,289 [[Spoilt vote|spoilt ballot papers]], an issue he addressed in his victory speech.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.buckinghamtoday.co.uk/news/more-news/election-2015-john-bercow-addresses-spoilt-ballot-papers-issue-after-election-victory-1-6733177|title=ELECTION 2015: John Bercow addresses spoilt ballot papers issue after election victory|work=Buckingham and Winslow Advertiser|access-date=8 May 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150511003003/http://www.buckinghamtoday.co.uk/news/more-news/election-2015-john-bercow-addresses-spoilt-ballot-papers-issue-after-election-victory-1-6733177|archive-date=11 May 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>

On 26 March 2015, the House of Commons defeated a government motion (introduced by former Conservative party leader and then leader of the House of Commons [[William Hague]]) to require there to be a secret ballot vote on whether Bercow remain speaker after the [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015 general election]]. A number of MPs described it as an underhand plot to oust Bercow, largely based on the timing of the motion just before the dissolution of Parliament, when some Labour MPs expected to oppose it had already returned to their constituencies.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-32061097|title=Bid to change Speaker rules defeated amid emotional scenes|date=26 March 2015|work=BBC News|access-date=21 June 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180405211953/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-32061097|archive-date=5 April 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/mar/26/tory-backbench-rebellion-defeats-hagues-attempt-to-unseat-speaker-john-bercow|title=Tory backbench rebellion defeats Hague's attempt to unseat Speaker|first=Patrick Wintour Political|last=editor|date=26 March 2015|newspaper=The Guardian|access-date=14 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191019072445/https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/mar/26/tory-backbench-rebellion-defeats-hagues-attempt-to-unseat-speaker-john-bercow|archive-date=19 October 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/david-cameron/11497740/Sour-end-to-Parliament-for-Tories-as-plot-against-Bercow-is-routed.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Matthew | last=Holehouse | title=Sour end to Parliament for Tories as 'plot' against Bercow is routed | date=26 March 2015 | access-date=2 April 2018 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180302103941/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/david-cameron/11497740/Sour-end-to-Parliament-for-Tories-as-plot-against-Bercow-is-routed.html | archive-date=2 March 2018 | url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/john-bercow-governments-squalid-plot-to-oust-the-speaker-fails-10137132.html | location=London | work=The Independent | first=Oliver | last=Wright | title=John Bercow: Government's 'squalid' plot to oust the Speaker fails | date=26 March 2015 | access-date=1 September 2017 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170615182136/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/john-bercow-governments-squalid-plot-to-oust-the-speaker-fails-10137132.html | archive-date=15 June 2017 | url-status=live }}</ref> In the event, Bercow was re-elected unopposed as Speaker following the general election.

In May 2018, Bercow's former private secretary Angus Sinclair alleged on the [[BBC]]'s ''[[Newsnight]]'' programme that Bercow had repeatedly bullied him while at work.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-43963788|title=Bercow accused of bullying private secretary|first=Chris Cook and Lucinda|last=Day|date=2 May 2018|work=BBC News|access-date=25 May 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180505210429/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-43963788|archive-date=5 May 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> Sinclair said that he was told to sign a [[non-disclosure agreement]] when he left his post, to prevent him revealing Bercow's bullying.

In January 2020, [[Robert Rogers, Baron Lisvane|Lord Lisvane]], who served as [[Clerk of the House of Commons]] under Bercow, submitted a formal complaint to the [[Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards]].

==== Brexit ====
In January 2019, Bercow broke with convention, allowing a vote on an amendment to a government business motion. The amendment, tabled by [[Dominic Grieve|Dominic Grieve MP]], required the Prime Minister ([[Theresa May]]) to table a motion within three days on proposed alternative plans if her [[Brexit]] deal was rejected by Parliament.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/brexit-bercow-vote-grieve-amendment-conservatives-tory-party-theresa-may-plan-b-eu-a8722691.html|title='John Bercow has shown he will play a pivotal role in the Brexit endgame – here's how'|date=11 January 2019|website=The Independent|access-date=12 January 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190113071218/https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/brexit-bercow-vote-grieve-amendment-conservatives-tory-party-theresa-may-plan-b-eu-a8722691.html|archive-date=13 January 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

On 18 March 2019, Bercow, in a statement to the House, pre-empted a move by the Government to bring the UK/EU Withdrawal Agreement for a third vote. Citing a convention which dates back to 1604, Bercow stated that he would not allow a vote on a motion which was "substantially the same" as a previously rejected motion.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-47614074|title=Third Brexit vote must be different – Speaker|date=18 March 2019|access-date=25 March 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190327160430/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-47614074|archive-date=27 March 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>
