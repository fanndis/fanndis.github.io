'''Hunan''' (<!-- details in infobox -->{{zh|c={{Audio|zh-Hunan.ogg|湖南|help=no}}|labels=no}}) is a landlocked [[Provinces of China|province]] of the People's Republic of [[China]], part of the [[South Central China]] region. Located in the middle reaches of the [[Yangtze]] watershed, it borders the [[Administrative divisions of China|province-level divisions]] of [[Hubei]] to the north, [[Jiangxi]] to the east, [[Guangdong]] and [[Guangxi]] to the south, [[Guizhou]] to the west and [[Chongqing]] to the northwest. Its capital and largest city is [[Changsha]], which also abuts the Xiang River. With a population of just over 67&nbsp;million {{As of|lc=y|2014}} residing in an area of approximately {{convert|210000|km2|abbr=on}}, it is China's [[List of Chinese administrative divisions by population|7th most populous]] province by population and the [[List of Chinese administrative divisions by area|10th most extensive]] province by area. Its 2018 [[Gross domestic product#Nominal GDP and adjustments to GDP|nominal GDP]] was more than US$500 billion, which is among the top 30 [[List of country subdivisions by GDP over 200 billion USD|largest sub-national economies in the world]] with its [[Purchasing power parity|PPP GDP]] being over US$1 trillion.

== History ==
{{more citations needed section|date=February 2014}}
[[File:Fenghuang old town.JPG|thumb|Fenghuang, a traditional town of Hunan]]
Hunan's primeval forests were first occupied by the ancestors of the modern [[Miao people|Miao]], [[Tujia people|Tujia]], [[Dong people|Dong]] and [[Yao people]]s. The province entered written [[history of China|Chinese history]] around 350 BC, when under the kings of the [[Zhou dynasty]], the province became part of the [[State of Chu]]. After [[Qin (state)|Qin]] conquered the Chu heartland in 278 BC, the region came under the control of Qin, and then the [[Changsha Kingdom]] during the [[Han dynasty]]. At this time, and for hundreds of years thereafter, the province was a magnet for settlement of [[Han Chinese]] from the north, who displaced and assimilated the original indigenous inhabitants, cleared forests and began farming rice in the valleys and plains.<ref>Harold Wiens. Han Expansion in South China. (Shoe String Press, 1967).</ref> The agricultural colonization of the lowlands was carried out in part by the Han empire, which managed river dikes to protect farmland from floods.<ref>Brian Lander. State Management of River Dikes in Early China: New Sources on the Environmental History of the Central Yangzi Region . T'oung Pao 100.4-5 (2014): 325–362</ref> To this day many of the small villages in Hunan are named after the Han families who settled there. Migration from the north was especially prevalent during the [[Eastern Jin dynasty]] and the [[Northern and Southern dynasties]] periods, when nomadic invaders pushed these peoples south.

During the [[Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period]], Hunan was home to its own independent regime, [[Chu (Ten Kingdoms)|Ma Chu]].

Hunan and [[Hubei]] became a part of the province of [[Huguang]] until the [[Qing dynasty]]. Hunan province was created in 1664 from Huguang, renamed to its current name in 1723.

Hunan became an important communications center due to its position on the [[Yangzi River]]. It was an important centre of scholarly activity and [[Confucian]] thought, particularly in the [[Yuelu Academy]] in [[Changsha]]. It was also on the Imperial Highway constructed between northern and southern China. The land produced grain so abundantly that it fed many parts of China with its surpluses. The population continued to climb until, by the nineteenth century, Hunan became overcrowded and prone to peasant uprisings. Some of the uprisings, such as the ten-year [[Miao Rebellion 1795-1806|Miao Rebellion of 1795–1806]], were caused by ethnic tensions. The [[Taiping Rebellion]] began in the south in [[Guangxi]] Province in 1850. The rebellion spread into Hunan and then further eastward along the Yangzi River valley. Ultimately, it was a Hunanese army under [[Zeng Guofan]] who marched into [[Nanjing]] to put down the uprising in 1864. [[File:Type 92 Heavy Machine Gun2.jpg|thumb|Japanese invading soldiers firing across the [[Miluo River]] during the [[Battle of Changsha (1939)|Battle of Changsha]] of the WWII in Asia|222x222px]]

In 1920, a famine raged throughout Hunan and killed an estimated 2 million Hunanese civilians.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wGKZDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA134|title=Political Routes to Starvation: Why Does Famine Kill?|isbn=9781622735082|last1=Dianda|first1=Bas|date=15 March 2019}}</ref> This sparked the [[Autumn Harvest Uprising]] of 1927. It was led by Hunanese native [[Mao Zedong]], and established a short-lived Hunan Soviet in 1927. The Communists maintained a guerrilla army in the mountains along the Hunan-[[Jiangxi]] border until 1934. Under pressure from the Nationalist [[Kuomintang]] (KMT) forces, they began the [[Long March]] to bases in [[Shaanxi]] Province. After the departure of the Communists, the KMT army fought against the Japanese in the [[second Sino-Japanese war]]. They defended Changsha until it fell in 1944. Japan launched [[Operation Ichigo]], a plan to control the railroad from [[Wuchang, Hubei|Wuchang]] to [[Guangzhou]] ([[Yuehan Railway]]). Hunan was relatively unscathed by the civil war that followed the defeat of the Japanese in 1945. In 1949, the Communists returned once more as the Nationalists retreated southward.

As Mao Zedong's home province, Hunan supported the [[Cultural Revolution]] of 1966–1976 {{Citation needed|reason= This is a fairly bold claim. It would be useful frame of reference establishing "support". Was it more supportive than other regions? How is that measured or established. "Support" seems vague. |date=July 2018}}. However, it was slower than most provinces in adopting the reforms implemented by [[Deng Xiaoping]] in the years that followed Mao's death in 1976.

In addition to [[Mao Zedong]], a number of other first-generation communist leaders were also from Hunan: [[President of the People's Republic of China|President]] [[Liu Shaoqi]]; [[Secretary-general of the Communist Party of China|Secretary-generals]] [[Ren Bishi]] and [[Hu Yaobang]]; Marshals [[Peng Dehuai]], [[He Long]], and [[Luo Ronghuan]]; [[Wang Zhen (general)|Wang Zhen]], one of the [[Eight Elders of the Communist Party of China|Eight Elders]]; [[Xiang Jingyu]], the first female member of the party's central committee; Senior General [[Huang Kecheng]]; and veteran diplomat [[Lin Boqu]]. An example of a more recent leader from Hunan is former Premier [[Zhu Rongji]].

== Geography ==
{{expand section|date=July 2014}}
{{main|Geography of Hunan}}
Hunan is located on the south bank of the [[Yangtze River]], about half way along its length, situated between 108° 47'–114° 16' east [[longitude]] and 24° 37'–30° 08' north [[latitude]]. Hunan covers an area of {{convert|211800|km2|abbr=off}}, making it the [[List of People's Republic of China administrative divisions by area|10th largest]] provincial-level division. The east, south and west sides of the province are surrounded by mountains and hills, such as the [[Wuling Mountains]] to the northwest, the [[Xuefeng Mountains]] to the west, the [[Nanling Mountains]] to the south, and the [[Luoxiao Mountains]] to the east. Mountains and hills occupy more than 80% of the province, and plains less than 20%. At 2115.2 meters above sea level, the highest point in Hunan province is Lingfeng ({{lang|zh-hans-cn|酃峰}}).<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.sohu.com/a/162119207_698908 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2018-04-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180408141501/http://www.sohu.com/a/162119207_698908 |archive-date=2018-04-08 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.hn.xinhuanet.com/2013-09/26/c_117523544.htm |script-title=zh:湖南"新高度"——酃峰 |work=[[Xinhua]] Hunan |date=2013-09-26 |accessdate=2015-07-29}} {{Dead link|date=January 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.xxcb.cn/hxdl/texie/2016-01-30/9045785.html |script-title=zh:最美的山峰：酃峰海拔2115.2米湖南第一高峰 |script-work=zh:潇湘晨报 |last1=Wang |first1=Shuo (王砚) |editor-last1=Pei |editor-first1=Li (裴力) |date=2016-01-30 |access-date=2018-04-08 |archive-date=2018-04-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180408141247/http://www.xxcb.cn/hxdl/texie/2016-01-30/9045785.html |url-status=dead }}</ref>

The [[Xiang River|Xiang]], the [[Zi River|Zi]], the [[Yuan River|Yuan]] and the [[Lishui River|Lishui]] Rivers converge on the Yangtze River at [[Lake Dongting]] in the north of Hunan. The center and northern parts are somewhat low and a U-shaped basin, open in the north and with Lake Dongting as its center. Most of Hunan lies in the basins of four major tributaries of the Yangtze River.

[[Dongting Lake|Lake Dongting]] is the largest lake in the province and the second largest freshwater lake of China.

The [[Xiaoxiang]] area and Lake Dongting figure prominently in Chinese poetry and paintings, particularly during the Song dynasty when they were associated with officials who had been unjustly dismissed.<ref>{{cite book|author=Alfreda Murck|title=Poetry and Painting in Song China: The Subtle Art of Dissent|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1eGqk66tvsQC&pg=PP1|year=2000|publisher=Harvard Univ Asia Center|isbn=978-0-674-00782-6|access-date=2016-10-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170110082823/https://books.google.com/books?id=1eGqk66tvsQC&pg=PP1|archive-date=2017-01-10|url-status=live}}</ref>

Changsha (which means "long sands") was an active ceramics district during the [[Tang dynasty]], its tea bowls, ewers and other products mass-produced and shipped to China's coastal cities for export abroad. An Arab dhow dated to the 830s and today known as the [[Belitung Shipwreck]] was discovered off the small island of Belitung, Indonesia with more than 60,000 pieces in its cargo. The salvaged cargo is today housed in nearby Singapore.

Hunan's climate is [[subtropical]], and, under the [[Köppen climate classification]], is classified as being [[humid subtropical]] (Köppen ''Cfa''), with short, cool, damp winters, very hot and humid summers, and plenty of rainfall. January temperatures average {{convert|3|to|8|°C|°F}} while July temperatures average around {{convert|27|to|30|°C|°F}}. Average annual precipitation is {{convert|1200|to|1700|mm}}.
The [[Furongian]] Epoch in the [[Cambrian]] Period of geological time is named for Hunan; Furong ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|芙蓉}}}}) means "[[lotus (genus)|lotus]]" in Mandarin and refers to Hunan which is known as the "lotus state".<ref>{{cite journal|last=Peng|first=Shanchi|author2=Babcock, Loren|author3= Robison, Richard|author4= Lin, Huanling|author5= Rees, Margaret|author6= Saltzman, Matthew|title=Global Standard Stratotype-section and Point (GSSP) of the Furongian Series and Paibian Stage (Cambrian)|journal=Lethaia|date=30 November 2004|volume=37|issue=4|pages=365–379|doi=10.1080/00241160410002081|url=http://www.stratigraphy.org/GSSP/file43.pdf|accessdate=14 September 2012}}</ref>

==Politics==
{{main|Politics of Hunan|List of provincial leaders of the People's Republic of China}}
[[File:Young Mao Zedong statue 5.jpg|thumb|[[Young Mao Zedong statue]] in Changsha]]
The politics of Hunan is structured in a dual party-government system like all other governing institutions in [[mainland China]].

The [[Governor of Hunan]] is the highest-ranking official in the People's Government of Hunan. However, in the province's dual party-government governing system, the Governor has less power than the Hunan [[Communist Party of China]] Provincial Committee Secretary, colloquially termed the "Hunan [[CPC Party Chief]]".

== Economy ==
As of the mid 19th century, Hunan exported [[rhubarb]], musk, honey, tobacco, [[hemp]], and birds.<ref name=Roberts1>{{cite book|last=Roberts|first=Edmund|title=Embassy to the Eastern Courts of Cochin-China, Siam, and Muscat|year=1837|publisher=Harper & Brothers|location=New York|page=123|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/7317/view/1/123/|access-date=2013-10-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131016074209/http://www.wdl.org/en/item/7317/view/1/123/|archive-date=2013-10-16|url-status=live}}</ref> The [[Lake Dongting]] area is an important center of [[ramie]] production, and Hunan is also an important center of tea cultivation. Aside from agricultural products, in recent years Hunan has grown to become an important center for steel, machinery and electronics production, especially as China's manufacturing sector moves away from coastal provinces such as [[Guangdong]] and [[Zhejiang]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thechinaperspective.com/topics/province/hunan-province/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-10-31 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008045908/http://thechinaperspective.com/topics/province/hunan-province/ |archive-date=2011-10-08 }}</ref>

The [[Lengshuijiang]] area is noted for its [[stibnite]] mines, and is one of the major centers of [[antimony]] extraction in China. {{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

Hunan is also well known for a few global makers of construction equipment such as [[concrete pumps]], [[crane (machine)|cranes]], etc. These companies include [[Sany Group]], [[Zoomlion]] and [[Sunward Intelligent Equipment|Sunward]]. Sany is one of the world's major players. The city of [[Liuyang]] is the world's top center for manufacturing [[fireworks]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.enghunan.gov.cn/|title=Hunan Government Website International-enghunan.gov.cn|first=Hunan|last=Government|website=www.enghunan.gov.cn|access-date=2009-02-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090208211939/http://enghunan.gov.cn/|archive-date=2009-02-08|url-status=live}}</ref>
