'''Saint-Louis University, Brussels''' or '''UCLouvain Saint-Louis Brussels'''<ref>{{Cite book|last=|first=|title=Marque UCLouvain - Argumentaire|date=16 May 2018|publisher=[[UCLouvain|University of Louvain]]|year=2018|isbn=|location=[[Louvain-la-Neuve]]|pages=1|language=French}}</ref> (officially, in French '''Université Saint-Louis – Bruxelles''') is a [[public university]] in [[Brussels]], belonging to the [[French Community of Belgium]] and specialized in [[Social science|social]] and [[human science]]s.

Prior to 2012 it was known as the '''Facultés universitaires Saint-Louis''' (abbreviated '''FUSL'''). From September 2018 on, the university uses the name '''UCLouvain''', together with the [[Université catholique de Louvain|University of Louvain]], in the context of a merger between both universities.

==History==
When the [[Catholic University of Mechelen|Catholic University of Belgium]] moved from [[Mechelen]] to [[Leuven]] in 1835, the unused buildings were used to host the newly founded ''École de Commerce et d'Industrie'' (School of Trade and Industry), which was inaugurated in 1838.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Vaesen|first=Joost|last2=Wayens|first2=Benjamin|date=23 April 2014|title=Higher Education and Brussels|journal=Brussels Studies|volume=76|pages=4|doi=10.4000/brussels.1219|doi-access=free}}</ref>

The school moved to Brussels in 1858 and became the ''Institut Saint-Louis'' (a diocesan secondary school), where the Philosophy Department was founded, which eventually grew to become a university. This was the result of the [[Catholic clergy]]'s and [[Pope Pius IX]]'s wish to have a Catholic institution in Brussels teaching [[philosophy]]. The department prepared candidates for the higher [[liberal arts]] certification that would qualify them to enroll for a university law degree.<ref name=":0">[http://www.usaintlouis.be/sl/915.html A Short History of Saint-Louis], University Website. Accessed 20 February 2016.</ref>

In 1891, with the recognition of non-state universities, the institution became recognized as an autonomous ('free') university, instead of being a private institution, which was confirmed in 1929.

Over time, the Faculties developed and expanded, and a Faculty of Law was added to the Faculty of Philosophy and Letters.

In 1925, the university founded {{ill|Haute École groupe ICHEC - ISC Saint-Louis - ISFSC|fr|lt=HEC Saint-Louis}} (''Hautes études commerciales''), Belgium's first independent business school, together with its [[Dutch language|Dutch-speaking]] counterpart, [[EHSAL]] (''St. Aloysius College of Economics''). Also, the university established the world-renowned School of Philosophical and Religious Sciences, founded by [[Désiré-Joseph Mercier|Cardinal Mercier]].

In 1948, the Philosophy and Arts section separated from the ''Institut Saint-Louis'', and continued independently as a non-profit university under the name "Faculté universitaire Saint-Louis". It was not until 1960 that the administrative split was fully effective and the buildings separated.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.usaintlouis.be/sl/915.html|title=A short history of Saint-Louis|website=Université Saint-Louis - Bruxelles|access-date=28 February 2019}}</ref>

In 1965, the Faculty of Economic, Social and Political Sciences (ESPO) was established and the university's name was later changed to the plural ''Facultés universitaires Saint-Louis''.

In 1969, Saint-Louis starts giving lectures to [[Dutch language|Dutch-speaking]] students, in addition to lessons at EHSAL/HEC, but the Dutch-speaking department would leave the ''Facultés universitaires Saint-Louis'' in 1973, to create the independent ''Universitaire Faculteiten Sint-Aloysius'' (UFSAL). This later became the [[Catholic University of Brussels]] (K.U.Brussel). Both UFSAL and EHSAL merged to create the [[Hogeschool-Universiteit Brussel]] (HUB), together with other [[Flemish Community|Flemish]] institutions like [[Vlekho]], which originated from the Saint-Louis-linked ''[[Institut libre Marie Haps]]''. In 2013, HUB was reorganized and today comprises the ''KU Leuven campus Brussel'', and the vocational college [[Odisee]]. Both are still located in the same street as Saint-Louis University, the ''rue du Marais/Broekstraat''.

French-speaking HEC Saint-Louis, which was renamed to ISC Saint-Louis (''Institut Supérieur de Commerce''), co-founded the "ICHEC - ISC Saint-Louis - ISFSC" Consortium of Schools in 1995, and ''[[de facto]]'' integrated the [[ICHEC Brussels Management School|Institut catholique des Hautes Études commerciales]] (ICHEC) in 2004. Saint-Louis University, Brussels still organises degrees in economics, management and business engineering, on the same site as the ISC Saint-Louis, within its Faculty of Economics, Politics, Social and Communication Sciences (ESPO).

Between 2004 and 2013, Saint-Louis University and the three other Belgian French-speaking historically Catholic universities; the [[Université de Namur|University of Namur]], the [[Université catholique de Louvain]] and the [[UCLouvain FUCaM Mons|Facultés universitaires catholiques de Mons]] (now a part of UCLouvain) made up the [[Académie universitaire Louvain]] network.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.academielouvain.beview.php3?include=355&pere=132|title=Académie universitaire Louvain / English / Members}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> This notably meant the integration of Saint-Louis' economics and management programmes into the [[Louvain School of Management]]. After the reform of [[List of universities in Belgium|Belgian French-speaking universities]] in 2013, Saint-Louis became a founding member of the ''Pôle académique de Bruxelles'', along with the [[Université libre de Bruxelles]] and, by decree, was renamed from ''Facultés universitaires Saint-Louis'' to ''Université Saint-Louis - Bruxelles''.

In May 2017, Saint-Louis University, Brussels and the [[Université catholique de Louvain|University of Louvain]] (primarily based in [[Louvain-la-Neuve]] and which has 2 campuses in Brussels: [[UCLouvain Brussels Woluwe|Woluwe]] and [[UCLouvain Faculty of Architecture, Architectural Engineering and Urban Planning|Saint-Gilles]]) officially announced that the two universities were merging in a single institution named UCLouvain, with Saint-Louis becoming 'UCLouvain Saint-Louis - Bruxelles'.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://uclouvain.be/fr/decouvrir/actualites/l-ucl-et-l-usl-b-en-route-vers-la-fusion.html|title=L'UCL et l'USL-B : en route vers la fusion {{!}} UCLouvain|website=uclouvain.be|language=fr|access-date=2017-11-21}}</ref> Both institutions have started using the name UCLouvain in September 2018.

Saint-Louis' main campus is located on the northern edge of the historic inner city, opposite the [[Botanical Garden of Brussels]] across the [[small ring]] road. In 2015, the department and programmes of translation and interpreting of the [[Institut libre Marie Haps]] were transferred to the newly established [[Marie Haps Faculty of Translation and Interpreting]] at Saint-Louis University, Brussels.<ref>Isabelle Lemaire, [http://www.lalibre.be/actu/belgique/l-ucl-et-saint-louis-cooptent-marie-haps-54ea0b5f35701001a1dfe5a0 L'UCL et Saint-Louis cooptent Marie Haps], ''[[La Libre Belgique]]'' 22 February 2015; updated 23 February 2015. Accessed 20 February 2016.</ref> This fifth Faculty is located in buildings along the ''rue d'Arlon'', near the [[Espace Léopold|European Parliament]].

In 2004, a fire destroyed offices and a large part of the library was flooded following the intervention of the fire brigade. A new library was built and inaugurated in 2005, some elements of the old library remain (including part of the imposing wooden staircase). The university's main library is installed on the third and fourth floors of the new Ommegang building in 2018.

In 2015, the university acquired an office building belonging to [[Belfius|Belfius bank]], the Ommegang, next to the University's establishment located at 109 rue du Marais, in order to relieve the institution's infrastructure, whose number of students has tripled in fifteen years.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://louisdewaele.be/realisations/ommegang/?rid=2867&generatepdf_nonce=19205f9c36|title=OMMEGANG - Les Entreprises Louis De Waele|website=Les Entreprises Louis De Waele}}</ref> New [[Lecture hall|lecture theatres]] were built, including the institution's largest auditorium, a new library, a new multi-purpose room for 1300 people, and a residence with about 100 student apartments. The new facilities are accessible since the 2017 academic year, increasing the surface area of the main Saint-Louis campus from 25,000 m² to 47,000 m².<ref name=":2">{{Cite news|url=http://www.lalibre.be/regions/bruxelles/st-louis-s-etend-au-centre-ville-54c2bb173570af82d50999fc|title=St-Louis s'étend au centre-ville|last=Laporte|first=Christian|date=|work=La Libre|access-date=}}</ref>

Most Master's diplomas and university certificates are double degrees with one or more [[Belgium|Belgian]] or foreign universities.

===Research centers===
Since its foundation, Saint-Louis has distinguished itself by its university character, which is to produce knowledge in addition to offering it. The first research centres were set up at the end of the 19th century. In 1995, the decree organizing higher education granted the University the right to organize doctoral theses, further contributing to the expansion of research.

The university organises research through three research institutes:

* Interdisciplinarity and Society Network (RIS)
* Interdisciplinary Research Institute on Brussels (IRIB), formed in 1980, fifteen years before the creation of the [[Brussels|Brussels-Capital Region]], as the Centre for Interdisciplinary Studies of the Brussels Region (CERB).

and various [[research center]]s:

* The Belgian Centre for Burgundian Studies 1400-1600
* Centre for Anthropology, Sociology and Psychology: Studies and Research (CASPER)
* Private Law Centre (CePri)
* Research Centre in Economics (CEREC)
* Centre for Research in Political Science (CReSPo)
* Centre for Research in the History of Law, Institutions and Society (CRHiDI)
* Centre for the Study of Environmental Law (CEDRE)
* Centre for Sociological Studies (CES)
* Centre for Innovation and Intellectual Property (CIPI)
* Interdisciplinary Research Centre for Constitutional and Administrative Law (IARC)
* Inter-University Centre for Mobility Studies

Saint-Louis University, Brussels has also founded the Brussels Studies Institute together with the two other Brussels universities: [[Université libre de Bruxelles]] and [[Vrije Universiteit Brussel]].

===School of Philosophical and Religious Sciences===
The School of Philosophical and Religious Sciences, founded in 1925 by [[Désiré-Joseph Mercier|cardinal Mercier]], is not a research center nor a faculty, but continues to teach and study philosophy, theology and social and human sciences, to which it has been a major contributor. Chairs of the School of Philosophical and Religious Sciences are always public and have included [[Paul Ricœur]], [[Michel Serres]], [[Philippe Lacoue-Labarthe]], [[Cornelius Castoriadis]], [[Jean-Luc Nancy]], [[Jacques Lacan]], [[Tzvetan Todorov]], [[Alain Touraine]] or [[Pierre Bourdieu]].
