'''Thomas Ludwig John D'Alesandro Jr.''' (August 1, 1903 – August 23, 1987) was an [[United States|American]] [[politician]] who was a [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] from [[Maryland's 3rd congressional district]] (1939–47) and subsequently the mayor of [[Baltimore, Maryland]] (1947–59). He was the father of [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives]] [[Nancy Pelosi|Nancy Patricia Pelosi]], the first female Speaker of the House, and [[Thomas D'Alesandro III]], also a mayor of Baltimore.

==Early life==
D'Alesandro was born in Baltimore on August 1, 1903.  He was the son of Maria Petronilla (née Foppiani) and Tommaso G. D'Alesandro, who were born in [[Montenerodomo]], [[Abruzzo]], [[Italy]].  D'Alesandro attended Calvert Business College in Baltimore. Before beginning his political career, he worked as an insurance and real estate broker.<ref name="history.house.gov">{{Cite web|url=https://history.house.gov/People/Listing/D/D-ALESANDRO,-Thomas,-Jr--(D000007)/|title=D'ALESANDRO, Thomas, Jr. {{!}} US House of Representatives: History, Art & Archives|website=history.house.gov|language=en|access-date=2019-01-24}}</ref>

==Career==
A [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]], D'Alesandro served as a member of the [[Maryland House of Delegates|Maryland State House of Delegates]] from 1926 to 1933.  After serving in [[Annapolis, Maryland|Annapolis]], D'Alesandro was then appointed as General Deputy Collector of Internal Revenue, a post in which he served during 1933–1934. He then was elected to serve on the [[Baltimore City Council]] from 1935 to 1938.

D'Alesandro was then elected to the [[76th United States Congress|76th Congress]] and to the four succeeding Congresses, serving from January 3, 1939, until he resigned on May 16, 1947. While in Congress, D'Alesandro strongly supported the [[Bergson Group#Bergson Group|Bergson Group]], a "[[political action committee]] set up to challenge the [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Roosevelt Administration's]] policies on the [[Jewish refugees|Jewish refugee issue]] during the [[Holocaust]], and later lobbied against [[British Mandate for Palestine (legal instrument)|British control of Palestine]]" despite his equally strong support for Roosevelt's other policies.<ref>Medoff, Rafael, [https://www.jpost.com/Opinion/Op-Ed-Contributors/Pelosis-father-and-the-Holocaust "Pelosi's father and the Holocaust."] ''[[Jerusalem Post]]''.  April 11, 2007.  April 16, 2007.</ref>{{Better source|date=January 2019}}

Following his service in Congress he was [[List of Baltimore Mayors|Mayor of Baltimore]] for 12 years from May 1947 to May 1959.<ref name="auto">{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/local/1987/08/24/baltimore-political-patriarch-thomas-j-dalesandro-jr-dies/5a3118d9-ea15-43c1-9433-cfe8f68b99e4/|title=BALTIMORE POLITICAL PATRIARCH THOMAS J.

Kennedy]]<ref name="history.house.gov"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.jfklibrary.org/asset-viewer/archives/JFKPOF/078a/JFKPOF-078a-006|title=Federal Renegotiation Board {{!}} JFK Library|website=www.jfklibrary.org|access-date=2019-01-24}}</ref>

===Political campaigns===
D'Alesandro was a strong contender for [[Governor of Maryland]] in [[1954 Maryland gubernatorial election|1954]], but was forced to drop out due to being implicated in receiving undeclared money from Dominic Piracci, a parking garage owner convicted of fraud, conspiracy, and conspiracy to obstruct justice.<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,860626,00.html "The Little World of Tommy" ],''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''. April 26, 1954.</ref> Piracci was the father of D'Alesandro's oldest son and namesake [[Thomas D'Alesandro III]]'s wife, Margie Piracci D'Alesandro. Mayor D'Alesandro was later exonerated and never indicted. Rather than lose the election, D'Alesandro withdrew and tacitly supported [[University of Maryland]] President [[Curley Byrd]] who would go on to lose by 54.5% to 45.5% to the Republican incumbent and D'Alesandro's predecessor as [[Mayor of Baltimore]] [[Theodore McKeldin]]. McKeldin would later defeat the man who defeated D'Alesandro for Mayor and then would be succeeded as mayor by D'Alesandro's son, who was married to the aforementioned Mr. Piracci's daughter.

[[1958 United States Senate election in Maryland|In 1958]], D'Alesandro ran for the [[United States Senate]] in a bid to defeat [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] incumbent [[J. Glenn Beall]] who in 1952 defeated perennial candidate/contractor [[George P. Mahoney]]. D'Alesandro had to first spend money and time dispatching the fiery Mahoney in the Democratic primary. D'Alesandro then ran a strong and close, but eventually unsuccessful campaign, against Beall. This was the first time D'Alesandro ever lost an election.<ref name="auto"/>

[[1959 Baltimore mayoral election|In 1959]], D'Alesandro was defeated in a bid for another term for [[Mayor of Baltimore]] by [[J. Harold Grady]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2002-01-10/news/0201100220_1_chief-judge-judge-grady-mayor-thomas-j|title=J.

===Criticism===

{{POV section|date=July 2019}}

In 2017, [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] commentators noted that in 1948, D'Alesandro dedicated the [[Stonewall Jackson and Robert E. Lee Monument]] in his capacity as [[Mayor of Baltimore]], along with the then-[[Governor of Maryland]], [[William Preston Lane Jr.]]<ref name="nypostnancypelosisdadhelpededicate">{{cite news|last1=Singman|first1=Brooke|title=Nancy Pelosi's dad helped dedicate Confederate statue|url=https://nypost.com/2017/08/24/nancy-pelosis-dad-helped-dedicate-confederate-statue/|access-date=August 26, 2017|work=The New York Post|date=August 24, 2017}}</ref> His son, [[Thomas D'Alesandro III]], who later served as Mayor of Baltimore from 1967 to 1971, said about his father "His whole life was politics. He was not what you would call a flaming [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]], but he was a progressive."<ref name="auto"/>

==Personal life==
He was married to Annunciata M. ("Nancy") Lombardi (1909-1995).<ref>''Baltimore Sun'', October 1, 1928, p. 20.</ref> Together, the couple had six children, five sons and a daughter, including:

* [[Thomas D'Alesandro III|Thomas L. J. D'Alesandro III]] (1929-2019), who also served as Mayor of Baltimore from 1967 to 1971.
* [[Nancy Pelosi|Nancy Patricia D'Alesandro Pelosi]] (born 1940), who is a Representative from [[California]], who served as the House of Representatives [[House Minority Leader]] between 2003 and 2007 and from 2011 to 2019, and as the [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] from January 4, 2007 until January 3, 2011 and again from January 3, 2019 to present.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Hirschfeld Davis |first1=Julie |title=Nancy Pelosi Elected Speaker as Democrats Take Control of House |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/03/us/politics/nancy-pelosi-speaker-116th-congress.html |website=The New York Times |publisher=The New York Times |accessdate=3 January 2019}}</ref>
