==Early life==
Michael Chertoff was born on November 28, 1953 in [[Elizabeth, New Jersey|Elizabeth]], [[New Jersey]]. His father was [[Rabbi]] Gershon Baruch Chertoff (1915–96), a [[Talmud]] scholar and the former leader of the Congregation B'nai Israel in Elizabeth. His mother is Livia Chertoff (née Eisen), an [[Israeli citizen]] and the first flight attendant for [[El Al Israel Airlines|El Al]].<ref>Kitaeff, Jack [https://books.google.com/books?id=7lfJVNXzBDQC&pg=PT95&dq=Livia+Chertoff&hl=en&sa=X&ei=x7UlUdyELYO-8ASzhIGYCg&ved=0CDUQ6AEwAQ Jews in Blue: The Jewish American Experience in Law Enforcement]</ref> His paternal grandparents are Rabbi Paul Chertoff<ref>Marek, Angie C.[https://www.usnews.com/usnews/news/articles/050718/18chertoff_2.htm "A New Sheriff in Town"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130510114149/http://www.usnews.com/usnews/news/articles/050718/18chertoff_2.htm |date=2013-05-10 }}, ''[[U.S. News & World Report]]'', July 10, 2005. Accessed May 16, 2008. "A rabbi's son, he was born in blue-collar Elizabeth, N.J. Worshipers from Elizabeth's former Congregation Bnai Israel remember Chertoff's father, Gershon Chertoff, as a man with a vast collection of books and a keen interest in current events. Michael's grandfather Paul Chertoff, also a rabbi, was a professor of the Talmud, the collected writings that constitute Jewish civil and religious law."</ref> and Esther Barish Chertoff.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1129&dat=19660112&id=eZ5RAAAAIBAJ&pg=7191,1640797 |title=Pittsburgh PostGazette Jan 12, 1966 |date=1966-01-12 |accessdate=2013-08-28}}</ref>

Chertoff attended the [[Jewish Educational Center]] in Elizabeth as well as the [[Pingry School]]. He graduated from [[Harvard College]] with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in 1975. During his sophomore year, he studied abroad at the [[London School of Economics and Political Science]]. He then attended [[Harvard Law School]], where he worked as a research assistant for [[John Hart Ely]] on his book ''Democracy and Distrust.'' After receiving a [[Juris Doctor]] ''[[magna cum laude]]'' in 1978, Chertoff served as a law clerk to Judge [[Murray Gurfein]] of the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit]] and later for [[United States Supreme Court]] Justice [[William J. Brennan, Jr.]] from 1979 to 1980.

He worked in private practice with [[Latham & Watkins]] from 1980 to 1983 before being hired as a prosecutor by [[Rudolph Giuliani]], then the [[United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York]]. Chertoff worked on [[American Mafia|Mafia]] and [[political corruption]]–related cases. In the mid-1990s, Chertoff returned to Latham & Watkins for a brief period, founding the firm's office in [[Newark, New Jersey]].

Chertoff has been a resident of [[Westfield, New Jersey|Westfield]], New Jersey.<ref>Corbin, Horace. [http://www.goleader.com/misc/services/photos/past/2010/10mar31_Chertoff/ "A Night With Michael Chertoff"], ''The Westfield Leader'', March 31, 2010. Accessed October 26, 2015. "Born in Elizabeth, N.J. and a former Westfield resident, Michael Chertoff returned to his Jersey roots last Wednesday night for dinner at Echo Lake Country Club, sponsored by Asm. Jon Bramnick."</ref>

== Public service ==
In September 1986, together with [[United States Attorney]] for the Southern District of New York [[Rudolph Giuliani]], Chertoff was instrumental in the crackdown on organized crime in the [[Mafia Commission Trial]].

In 1990, Chertoff was appointed by President [[George H. W. Bush]] as [[United States Attorney for the District of New Jersey]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.usdoj.gov/usao/nj/about/history.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081230012025/http://www.usdoj.gov/usao/nj/about/history.html|title=U.S. Attorney's Office District of New Jersey, A Rich History of Service|archive-date=December 30, 2008}}</ref> Among his most important cases, in 1992 Chertoff achieved conviction of second-term [[Jersey City, New Jersey|Jersey City]] mayor [[Gerald McCann]] on charges of [[fraud|defrauding]] money from a [[savings and loan]] scam. McCann served two years in federal prison.<ref name="msnbc"/>

In 1993, he was a prosecutor in the fraud case against Eddie Antar, founder of the Crazy Eddie's electronics store chain.

Chertoff was asked to stay in his position when the [[Clinton administration]] took office in 1993, at the request of [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] Senator [[Bill Bradley]].<ref name="msnbc">{{cite news|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/6813011|title=Chertoff called 'consummate professional'|date=2005-01-11|publisher=NBC News |via=[[Associated Press]]|accessdate=2008-10-15}}</ref> He was the only United States Attorney who was not replaced due to the change in administrations. He continued to work with the U.S. Attorney's office until 1994, when he entered private practice, returning to [[Latham & Watkins]] as a partner.<ref name="msnbc" />

Despite his friendly relationship with some Democrats, Chertoff was appointed as the special counsel for the [[Senate Whitewater Committee]] studying allegations against President Clinton and his wife in what was known as the [[Whitewater scandal|Whitewater]] investigation. No charges were brought against the Clintons.

In 2000, Chertoff worked as special counsel to the [[New Jersey Senate]] Judiciary Committee, investigating [[racial profiling]] in New Jersey. He also did some fundraising for [[George W. Bush]]<ref>{{cite news|last=Eskow|first=Richard|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/rj-eskow/in-clumsy-pr-move-banks-u_b_857868.html|title=Green Alert: Banks Use Bush Terror Team, Threat Tactics to Push Debit Card Fees|work=[[Huffington Post]]|date=May 5, 2011|accessdate=May 21, 2015}}</ref> and other Republicans{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} during the [[2000 U.S. presidential election|2000 election cycle]]. He advised Bush's presidential campaign on [[criminal justice]] issues. Chertoff was appointed by Bush to head the criminal division of the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]], serving from 2001 to 2003. He led the federal prosecution's case against suspected [[terrorist]] [[Zacarias Moussaoui]].

Chertoff also led the prosecution's case against accounting firm [[Arthur Andersen]] for destroying documents relating to the [[Enron]] collapse. The prosecution of Arthur Andersen was controversial, as the firm was effectively dissolved, resulting in the loss of 26,000 jobs. The United States [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] overturned the conviction, and the case has not been retried.

On March 5, 2003, Chertoff was nominated by President Bush to a seat on the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit]] vacated by [[Morton I. Greenberg]]. He was confirmed by the Senate 88–1 on June 9, 2003, with Senator Hillary Clinton of New York casting the lone dissenting vote; he received his commission the following day. Senator Clinton said that she had dissented to register her protest for the way Chertoff's staff mistreated junior White House staffers during the Whitewater investigation.<ref name="observe">{{cite news|url=http://observer.com/2005/01/hillarys-nemesis-mean-mike-chertoff-is-up-for-homeland/|title=Hillary's Nemesis, Mean Mike Chertoff, Is Up for Homeland|last=Ratner|first=Lizzy|date=2005-01-16|publisher=The New York Observer|accessdate=2008-10-15}}</ref>

==Secretary of Homeland Security and subsequent career==
[[File:Bush delivers statement at Mexican border.jpg|thumb|President Bush discussing [[Mexico–United States border|border]] security with Chertoff near [[El Paso, Texas]], November 2005]]
In late 2004, [[Bernard Kerik]] was forced to decline President Bush's offer to replace [[Tom Ridge]], the outgoing Secretary of Homeland Security. After a lengthy search to find a suitable replacement, Bush nominated Chertoff to the post in January 2005, citing his experience with post-9/11 terror legislation. He was unanimously approved for the position by the [[United States Senate]] on February 15, 2005.<ref name="newchief">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4165507.stm|title= Bush names new US security chief|date=2005-01-11|publisher=BBC|accessdate=2008-10-15}}</ref>

[[Hurricane Katrina]] occurred while Chertoff was Secretary of Homeland Security. The Department was criticized for its lack of preparation in advance of the well-forecast hurricane; most criticism was directed toward the [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]].<ref>[http://www.gpoaccess.gov/katrinareport/execsummary.pdf Executive Summary, Select Bipartisan Committee to Investigate the Preparation for and Response to Hurricane Katrina] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120211115815/http://www.gpoaccess.gov/katrinareport/execsummary.pdf |date=2012-02-11 }}, 2006-2-15, Retrieved 2007-6-11</ref> DHS in general, and Chertoff in particular, were criticized for responding poorly to the disaster, ignoring crucial information about the catastrophic nature of the storm and devoting little attention to the federal response to what became the most costly disaster in American history.<ref>Christopher Cooper and Robert Block. 2006. ''Disaster : Hurricane Katrina and the Failure of Homeland Security.'' New York: Times Books, 2006.</ref>

Chertoff was the Bush administration's point man for pushing the comprehensive immigration reform bill, a measure that stalled in the Senate in June 2007.<ref>[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=10876256 "Chertoff, Bush Look for Next Move on Immigration"], NPR, 8 June 2007</ref>

Chertoff was asked by the [[presidency of Barack Obama|Obama administration]] to stay in his post until 9 a.m. on January 21, 2009, (one day after President Obama's inauguration) "to ensure a smooth transition".<ref>"[http://voices.washingtonpost.com/44/2009/01/19/bush_homeland_security_officia.html?wprss=44 Bush Homeland Security Officials to Stay on Till Weds.]", Washington Post, 2009-01-19 (accessed 2009-01-21).</ref>

He formed The Chertoff Group (TCG) on February 2, 2009 to work on crisis and risk management. The firm is also led by Chad Sweet; he served as the Chief of Staff of Homeland Security while Chertoff was Secretary and also had a two-year stint at the Directorate of Operations for the CIA. They also employ [[Charles E. Allen]], Larry Castro, [[Jay M. Cohen]], [[Michael Hayden (general)|General Michael V. Hayden]] and other former high-ranking government employees and appointees.

Chertoff is also a member of the [https://www.atlanticcouncil.org Atlantic Council's]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/about/board-of-directors/|title=Board of Directors|website=Atlantic Council|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-11}}</ref> Board of Directors.

In a July 2020 ''New York Times'' opinion piece, Chertoff wrote of his concerns that the Trump administration was hijacking the DHS for political purposes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/28/opinion/homeland-security-portland-trump.html|title=Opinion &#124; The Hijacking of Homeland Security|first=Michael|last=Chertoff|date=July 28, 2020|via=NYTimes.com}}</ref>

==Views==

===Construction of border fence===
In April 2008, Chertoff was criticized in ''[[The New York Times]]'' editorial for waiving the [[Endangered Species Act]], the [[Clean Water Act]], and other [[environmental protection]] legislation to construct a {{convert|700|mi|km|adj=on}} fence along the [[Mexico–United States border]]. The ''Times'' wrote: "To the long list of things the Bush administration is willing to trash in its rush to appease immigration hard-liners, you can now add dozens of important environmental laws and hundreds of thousands of acres of fragile habitat on the southern border."<ref name="op-ed">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/03/opinion/03thu3.html|title=Michael Chertoff's Insult |last=Editorial|date=April 3, 2008|work=The New York Times|accessdate=2008-10-15}}</ref>

According to ''[[The New York Times]]'' columnist [[Adam Liptak]], Chertoff had excluded the Department of Homeland Security from having to follow laws "protecting the environment, [[endangered species]], [[migratory bird]]s, the [[bald eagle]], antiquities, farms, deserts, forests, [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] graves and religious freedom."<ref name="liptack">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/08/us/08bar.html |title=Power to Build Border Fence Is Above U.S. Law|last=Liptak|first=Adam|date=2008-04-08|work=The New York Times|accessdate=2008-10-15}}</ref>

A report issued by the [[Congressional Research Service]], the non-partisan research division of the [[Library of Congress]], said that the unchecked delegation of powers to Chertoff was unprecedented:

<blockquote>After a review of federal law, primarily through electronic database searches and consultations with various CRS experts, we were unable to locate a waiver provision identical to that of §102 of H.R. 418—i.e., a provision that contains 'notwithstanding' language, provides a secretary of an executive agency the authority to waive all laws such secretary determines necessary, and directs the secretary to waive such laws.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/pdf/national/20080408_CRS_report.pdf |title=Plaintiffs' Exhibit 2 | work=[[The New York Times]] | accessdate=May 12, 2010}}</ref></blockquote>

===Actions regarding illegal immigration===
In September 2007, Chertoff told a [[United States House of Representatives|House]] committee that the DHS would not tolerate interference by [[Sanctuary city|sanctuary cities]] that would block the "Basic Pilot Program," which requires some types of employers to validate the legal status of their workers.<ref>[https://www.dhs.gov/xprevprot/programs/gc_1185221678150.shtm#1 DHS - EVerify] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110309034700/http://www.dhs.gov/xprevprot/programs/gc_1185221678150.shtm#1 |date=2011-03-09 }} "DHS website" December 1, 2007</ref> He said that the DHS was exploring its legal options and intended to take action to prevent any interference with the law.<ref>[http://www.newsmax.com/newsfront/chertoff_illegals/2007/09/06/30532.html Chertoff Warns Sanctuary Cities on Illegals]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} "NewsMax" September 6, 2007</ref>

In 2008 it was reported that the residential housekeeping company Chertoff had hired to clean his house employed undocumented immigrants.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2008/12/11/chertoff-used-cleaning-company-hired-illegal-immigrants/ | work=Fox News | title=Chertoff Used Cleaning Company That Hired Illegal Immigrants | date=December 11, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.upi.com/Top_News/2008/12/11/Illegal-immigrants-cleaned-Chertoffs-home/UPI-55761229009653/ |title=UPI.com |publisher=UPI.com |date=2008-12-11 |accessdate=2013-08-28}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/12/10/AR2008121003524.html | work=The Washington Post | title=Cleaning Service Used by Chertoff Calls Immigration Laws Unfair | first=Spencer S. | last=Hsu | date=December 11, 2008 | accessdate=May 12, 2010}}</ref>

===Globalization===
At the Global Creative Leadership Summit in 2009, Chertoff described globalization as a double-edged sword. Although globalization may help raise the standard of living for people around the world, Chertoff claimed that it can also enable terrorists and transnational criminals.<ref>[http://www.creativeleadershipsummit.org/?q=node/730 Global Futures, Global Risks] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160110014558/http://www.creativeleadershipsummit.org/?q=node%2F730 |date=2016-01-10 }} 2009 Global Creative Leadership Summit.</ref>

===Body scanners===
Chertoff has been an advocate of enhanced technologies, such as [[full body scanner]]s.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dhs.gov/xnews/testimony/testimony_0035.shtm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101019200855/https://www.dhs.gov/xnews/testimony/testimony_0035.shtm|title=DHS.gov|archive-date=October 19, 2010}}</ref> His lobbying firm Chertoff Group (founded 2009) represents manufacturers of the scanners.<ref>{{cite web |author=12/30/09 9:33pm 12/30/09 9:33pm |url=http://gawker.com/5437499/why-is-michael-chertoff-so-excited-about-full+body-scanners |title=Why Is Michael Chertoff So Excited About Full-Body Scanners? |publisher=Gawker.com |accessdate=2013-08-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130827141800/http://gawker.com/5437499/why-is-michael-chertoff-so-excited-about-full+body-scanners |archive-date=2013-08-27 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=RonPaul.com on November 17, 2010 |url=http://www.ronpaul.com/2010-11-17/ron-paul-to-tsa-stop-radiating-our-bodies-and-fondling-our-children/ |title=Ron Paul to TSA: Stop Irradiating Our Bodies! |publisher=Ron Paul .com |date=2010-11-17 |accessdate=2013-08-28}}</ref>

===Climate change===
Chertoff co-signed the preface to the report "National Security and the Accelerating Risks of [[Climate Change]]" published in 2014 where he stated that "projected climate change is a complex multi-decade challenge. Without action to build resilience, it will increase security risks over much of the planet. It will not only increase threats to developing nations in resource-challenged parts of the world, but it will also test the security of nations with robust capability, including significant elements of our National Power here at home."<ref>CNA Military Advisory Board, May 2014. "National Security and the Accelerating Risks of Climate Change" http://templatelab.com/CNA-MAB-2014-REPORT/</ref>

===Political endorsements===
For the [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 presidential election]], Chertoff, who was involved as special counsel investigating Bill and Hillary Clinton for Whitewater in the 1990s, endorsed [[Hillary Clinton]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2016/10/06/496749561/once-clintons-prosecutor-during-whitewater-now-a-clinton-supporter|title=Once A Clinton Nemesis During Whitewater, Now A Clinton Supporter|publisher=NPR|date=October 6, 2016|accessdate=October 6, 2016}}</ref>
