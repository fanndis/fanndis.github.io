[[Geography of Kosovo|Geographically]] defined in an area of {{convert|10887|sqkm|abbr=on}}, Kosovo is [[landlocked]] in the center of the [[Balkans]] and bordered by the uncontested territory of Serbia to the north and east, [[North Macedonia]] to the southeast, [[Albania]] to the southwest and [[Montenegro]] to the west. It possesses remarkable varied and diverse landscapes for its size by [[Climate of Kosovo|climate]] along with [[geology]] and [[hydrology]]. Most of central Kosovo is dominated by the vast plains and fields of [[Metohija]] and [[Kosovo field (Kosovo)|Kosovo]]. The rugged [[Prokletije]] and [[Šar Mountains]] rise in the southwest and southeast, respectively.

Archaeological research has shown that the earliest known settlements in the territory of present-day Kosovo were linked to the [[Neolithic Europe|Neolithic]] [[Starčevo culture]] and the material culture groupins which succeeded it. The Bronze Age was marked by the arrival of [[Paleo-Balkan languages|Indo-European tribes]] and the appearance of [[tumuli]], a typical feature of Indo-European material culture, in existing and new sites. In classical antiquity, the central tribe which emerged in the territory of Kosovo was that of the [[Dardani]] who formed an independent polity known as the [[Kingdom of Dardania]] in the 4th century BCE. Dardania was annexed by the [[Roman Empire]] by the 1st century BCE and was later part of the provinces of [[Praevalitana]] and [[Dardania (Roman province)|Dardania]]. Kosovo remained part of the [[Byzantine Empire|eastern Roman Empire]] for over a thousand years. Byzantine administration was eroded by Slavic invasions beginning in the 6th-7th century AD. In the centuries thereafter control of the area alternated between the Byzantines and the [[First Bulgarian Empire]]. By the 13th century, Kosovo became part of [[medieval Serbia]]. The [[Battle of Kosovo]] of 1389 is considered to be one of the defining moments in Serbian medieval history. The region was the core of the Serbian medieval state, which has also been the seat of the [[Serbian Orthodox Church]] from the 14th century, when its status was upgraded to a [[patriarchate]].<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jLfX1q3kJzgC |title=Ethnic Groups and Population Changes in Twentieth-Century Central-Eastern Europe |page=364 |last=Sharpe |first=M.E |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170803211910/https://books.google.rs/books?id=jLfX1q3kJzgC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage |archive-date=3 August 2017 |isbn=9780765618337 |year=2003 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=RFE/RL Research Report: Weekly Analyses from the RFE/RL Research Institute, Том 3 |publisher=Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty}}</ref> The [[fall of the Serbian Empire]] in the late 14th century saw a quick succession of regional rulers until the 15th century when it became part of the [[Ottoman Empire]] until the early 20th century.

In the late 19th century, it was the centre of the [[Albanian National Awakening]]. Following their defeat in the [[Balkan Wars]], the Ottomans [[Treaty of London (1913)|ceded]] Kosovo to Serbia and Montenegro. Both countries joined [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] after [[World War I]], and following a period of [[Yugoslavism|Yugoslav unitarianism]] in the Kingdom, the post-World War II [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] constitution established the [[Socialist Autonomous Province of Kosovo|Autonomous Province of Kosovo and Metohija]] within the Yugoslav constituent republic of Serbia. Tensions between Kosovo's Albanian and Serb communities simmered through the 20th century and occasionally erupted into major violence, culminating in the [[Kosovo War]] of 1998 and 1999, which resulted in the withdrawal of the Yugoslav army, the establishment of the [[United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo]] and the declaration of independence in 2008. Serbia does not recognize Kosovo as a sovereign state, although with the [[Brussels Agreement (2013)|2013 Brussels Agreement]], it has accepted its state institutions.<ref name=":0">{{cite web |title=7 Years of Kosovo Howard Smith of Geelong |url=https://hsog.tk/2015/03/7-years-of-kosovo/ |access-date=13 April 2015 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20150413201519/https://hsog.tk/2015/03/7-years-of-kosovo/ |archive-date=13 April 2015 |url-status=dead}}</ref> While Serbia recognises administration of the territory by Kosovo's elected government, it continues to claim it as the [[Autonomous Province of Kosovo and Metohija]].<ref>{{cite magazine |first=Nikolas K. |last=Gvosdev |title=Kosovo and Serbia Make a Deal |url=https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/kosovo/2013-04-24/kosovo-and-serbia-make-deal |date=24 April 2013 |magazine=Foreign Affairs |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305041508/https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/kosovo/2013-04-24/kosovo-and-serbia-make-deal |archive-date=5 March 2016}}</ref>

The entire region that today corresponds to the territory is commonly referred to in English simply as ''Kosovo'' and in [[Albanian language|Albanian]] as ''Kosova'' ([[Albanian grammar|definite form]], {{IPA-sq|kɔˈsɔːva}}) or ''{{lang|sq|Kosovë}}'' ("indefinite" form, {{IPA-sq|kɔˈsɔːv}}). In Serbia, a formal distinction is made between the eastern and western areas; the term ''{{lang|sr-Latn|Kosovo}}'' ({{lang|sr|Косово}}) is used for the eastern part centred on the historical [[Kosovo field (region)|Kosovo Field]], while the western part is called ''[[Metohija]]'' ({{lang|sr|Метохија}}) (known as ''Dukagjini'' in Albanian).<ref name="constitution-serbia">{{cite web|url=http://www.parlament.gov.rs/content/eng/akta/ustav/ustav_ceo.asp|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101127021637/http://www.parlament.gov.rs/content/eng/akta/ustav/ustav_ceo.asp|archive-date=27 November 2010 |title=Constitution of the Republic of Serbia |publisher=Parlament.gov.rs |access-date=2 January 2011}}</ref>

''Kosovo'' ({{lang-sr-cyr|Косово}}, {{IPA-sr|kôsoʋo}}) is the Serbian neuter [[possessive adjective]] of ''kos'' (кос) "[[Common blackbird|blackbird]]", an [[ellipsis (linguistics)|ellipsis]] for ''Kosovo Polje'', 'blackbird field', the name of [[Kosovo field (region)|a plain]] situated in the eastern half of today's Kosovo and the site of the 1389 [[Battle of Kosovo|Battle of Kosovo Field]].<ref name="Inc.2015">{{cite book|author=IBP, Inc.|title=Kosovo Country Study Guide Volume 1 Strategic Information and Developments|year= 2015

Albanians also refer to Kosovo as [[Kingdom of Dardania|Dardania]], the name of an ancient kingdom and later [[Dardania (Roman province)|Roman province]], which covered the territory of modern-day Kosovo. The name is derived from the ancient tribe of the [[Dardani]], possibly related to a Proto-Albanian word ''dardā'', which means "pear".<ref>Albanian Etymological Dictionary, V.Orel, Koninklijke Brill, Leiden Boston Köln 1998, p. 56</ref> The former Kosovo President [[Ibrahim Rugova]] had been an enthusiastic backer of a "Dardanian" identity and the Kosovan flag and presidential seal refer to this national identity. However, the name "Kosova" remains more widely used among the Albanian population.

The current borders of Kosovo were drawn while part of Yugoslavia in 1945, when the [[Autonomous Region of Kosovo and Metohija (1945–1963)]] was created as an administrative division of the new [[People's Republic of Serbia]]. In 1963, it was raised from the level of an autonomous region to the level of an autonomous province as the [[Autonomous Province of Kosovo and Metohija (1963–1968)]]. In 1968, the dual name "Kosovo and Metohija" was reduced to a simple "Kosovo" in the name of the ''Socialist Autonomous Province of Kosovo''.

The strategic position including the abundant natural resources were favorable for the development of human settlements in Kosovo, as is highlighted by the hundreds of archaeological sites identified throughout its territory. The first archaeological expedition in Kosovo was organized by the Austro-Hungarian army during the [[World War I]] in the [[Illyrians|Illyrian]] [[tumuli]] burial grounds of Nepërbishti within the [[district of Prizren]].<ref name="SchermerShukriu">{{cite book |last1=Schermer |first1=Shirley |last2=Shukriu |first2=Edi |last3=Deskaj |first3=Sylvia |editor1-last=Marquez-Grant |editor1-first=Nicholas |editor2-last=Fibiger |editor2-first=Linda |title=The Routledge Handbook of Archaeological Human Remains and Legislation: An International Guide to Laws and Practice in the Excavation and Treatment of Archaeological Human Remains |date=2011 |publisher=Taylor & Francis |isbn=978-1136879562 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Lzi4N-74QmAC |page=235}}</ref> Since 2000, the increase in archaeological expeditions has revealed many, previously unknown sites. The earliest documented traces in Kosovo are associated to the [[Stone Age]], namely there are indications that cave dwellings might have existed, as for instance the Radivojce Cav close the spring of the [[Drin (river)|Drin River]], then there are some indications at Grnčar Cave in the [[Vitina (town)|municipality of Vitina]] and the Dema and Karamakaz Caves in [[Peja|municipality of Peja]] and others. 

Human settlement during the [[Paleolithic]] has not yet been confirmed by archaeological expeditions. The earliest archaeological evidence of organized settlement, which have been found in Kosovo, belong to the [[Neolithic]] [[Starčevo culture|Starčevo]] and [[Vinča culture|Vinča]] cultures.<ref name="Berisha">{{cite web |last=Berisha |first=Milot |title=Archaeological Guide of Kosovo |url=https://www.mkrs-ks.org/repository/docs/drafti_i_guides_-anglisht_final.pdf |year=2012 |publisher=Ministry of Culture of Kosovo |pages=17–18}}</ref> [[Vlashnjë]] and [[Runik]] are important sites of the [[Neolithic sites in Kosovo|Neolithic era]].

Therefore, until arguments of Paleolithic and Mesolithic man are confirmed, Neolithic man, respectively the Neolithic sites are considered as the chronological beginning of population in Kosovo. From this period until today Kosovo has been inhabited, and traces of activities of societies from prehistoric, ancient and up to medieval time are visible throughout its territory.

The [[Dardani]] were the most important [[Paleo-Balkan languages|Paleo-Balkan]] tribe in the region of Kosovo. A wide area which consists of Kosovo, parts of Northern Macedonia and eastern Serbia was named [[Kingdom of Dardania|Dardania]] after them in classical antiquity. The eastern parts of the region were at the [[Thraco-Illyrian]] contact zone. In archaeological research, Illyrian names are predominant in western Dardania (present-day Kosovo), while Thracian names are mostly found in eastern Dardania (present-day south-eastern Serbia). 

Thracian names are absent in western Dardania; some Illyrian names appear in the eastern parts. Thus, their identification as either an [[Illyrians|Illyrian]] or [[Thracians|Thracian]] tribe has been a subject of debate; the ethnolinguistic relationship between the two groups being largely uncertain and debated itself as well. The correspondence of Illyrian names - including those of the ruling elite - in Dardania with those of the southern Illyrians suggests a "thracianization" of parts of Dardania.<ref>{{cite book|last=Wilkes|first=John|title=The Illyrians|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4Nv6SPRKqs8C|year=1996|orig-year=1992|publisher=Wiley|isbn=978-0-631-19807-9|page=85}}{{quote|Whether the Dardanians were an Illyrian or a Thracian people has been much debated and one view suggests that the area was originally populated with Thracians who then exposed to direct contact with Illyrians over a long period. [..] The meaning of this state of affairs has been variously interpreted, ranging from notions of Thracianization' (in part) of an existing Illyrian population to the precise opposite. In favour of the latter may be the close correspondence of Illyrian names in Dardania with those of the southern 'real' lllyrians to their west, including the names of Dardanian rulers, Longarus, Bato, Monunius and Etuta, and those on later epitaphs, Epicadus, Scerviaedus, Tuta, Times and Cinna.}}</ref> The Dardani retained an individuality and succeeded to maintain themselves as a community after Roman conquest and they played an important role in the formation of new groupings in the Roman era.<ref name="Papazoglou">{{Cite book|last=Papazoglu|first=Fanula|author-link=Fanula Papazoglu|title=The Central Balkan Tribes in pre-Roman Times: Triballi, Autariatae, Dardanians, Scordisci and Moesians|year=1978|location=Amsterdam|publisher=Hakkert|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Up4JAQAAIAAJ|page=131|isbn=9789025607937}}</ref> 

The Roman state annexed Dardania by the first century CE. The importance of the area lay in its mining potential (''metalla Dardana'') which was heavily exploited in the CE centuries as highlighted by the large mining complex of [[Municipium Dardanorum]] and the designation of part of the region as an imperial mining district. Kosovo was part of two provinces, [[Praevalitana]] and [[Dardania (Roman province)|Dardania]].

In the next centuries, Kosovo was a frontier province of the [[Byzantine Empire]]. The region was exposed to an increasing number of raids from the 4th century AD onward, culminating with the [[Slavic migrations]] of the 6th and 7th centuries. The [[First Bulgarian Empire]] acquired Kosovo by the mid 9th century, but Byzantine control was [[Byzantine conquest of Bulgaria|restored]] by the late 10th century. In 1072, the leaders of the Bulgarian [[Uprising of Georgi Voiteh]] traveled from their center in [[Skopje]] to Prizren and held a meeting in which they invited [[Mihailo Vojislavljević]] of [[Duklja]] to send them assistance. Mihailo sent his son, [[Constantine Bodin]] with 300 of his soldiers.

Kosovo was part of the [[Ottoman Empire]] from 1455 to 1912, at first as part of the ''[[Subdivisions of the Ottoman Empire|eyalet]]'' of [[Rumelia]], and from 1864 as a separate [[Kosovo Province, Ottoman Empire|province]] (''[[vilayet]]''). During this time, [[Islam]] was introduced to the population. The [[Vilayet of Kosovo]] was an area much larger than today's Kosovo; it included all today's Kosovo territory, sections of the [[Sandžak]] region cutting into present-day [[Šumadija and Western Serbia]] and [[Montenegro]] along with the [[Kukës]] municipality, the surrounding region in present-day northern [[Albania]] and also parts of north-western North Macedonia with the city of [[Skopje]] (then Üsküp), as its capital. Between 1881 and 1912 (its final phase), it was internally expanded to include other regions of present-day North Macedonia, including larger urban settlements such as [[Štip]] (''İştip''), [[Kumanovo]] (''Kumanova'') and [[Kratovo, Macedonia|Kratovo]] (''Kratova''). According to some historians, Serbs likely formed a majority of Kosovo from the 8th to the mid-19th century.{{sfn|Banac|p=42}}<ref>''The Balkans: A Post-Communist History'', I Jeffries, R Bideleux 2007, p. 513</ref> Nevertheless, this claim is difficult to prove, as historians who base their works on Ottoman sources of the time give solid evidence that at least the western and central parts of Kosovo had an Albanian majority. The scholar Fredrick F. Anscombe shows that Prizren and [[Vučitrn]] (''Vulçitrin'') had no Serbian population in early 17th century. Prizren was inhabited by a mix of Catholic and Muslim Albanians, while Vučitrn had a mix of Albanian and Turkish speakers, followed by tiny a Serbian minority. [[Gjakova]] was founded by Albanians in the 16th century, and [[Peja]] (''İpek'') had a continuous presence of the Albanian Kelmendi tribe. Central Kosovo was mixed, but large parts of the [[Drenica|Drenica Valley]] were ethnically Albanian. Central Kosovo, as well as the cities of Prizren, Gjakova, and the region of [[Has (region)|Has]] regularly supplied the Ottoman forces with levies and mercenaries.<ref name="Anscombe">Anscombe, Frederick F.

Anscombe casts doubt on the fact that this exodus affected Kosovo, since there is no evidence that parts of Kosovo were depopulated. Evidence of depopulation can only be found in areas between [[Niš]] and Belgrade. Some Albanians from Skopje and other regions were displaced in order to fill some areas around Niš, but there is no evidence that such events took place in Kosovo.<ref>''The Serbs'', Sima Cirkovic.

Although initially stout opponents of the advancing Turks, Albanian chiefs ultimately came to accept the Ottomans as sovereigns. The resulting alliance facilitated the mass conversion of Albanians to Islam. Given that the Ottoman Empire's subjects were divided along religious (rather than ethnic) lines, Islamisation greatly elevated the status of Albanian chiefs. Prior to this, they were organised along simple tribal lines, living in the mountainous areas of modern Albania (from Kruje to the Šar range).<ref>Fine (1994), p. 51: "The Albanians were not to create any structure resembling a state until the fifteenth century. However, organised in tribes under their own chieftains, the Albanians dominated the mountains of most of what we today think of as Albania."</ref> Soon, they expanded into a depopulated Kosovo,<ref>Cirkovic. p. 244 "In Kosovo there were visible signs of ethnic change which had accumulated since the [[Middle Ages]] with the immigration of Albanian cattle farmers. In addition to the continual flow of settlers and the Islamicisation of urban centres, changes in the population were also caused by political events ... Serbs left territories still under the Sultan's control."</ref> as well as northwestern Macedonia, although some might have been autochthonous to the region.{{sfn|Banac|p=46}} However, Banac favours the idea that the main settlers of the time were Vlachs.{{sfn|Banac|p=42}} Centuries earlier, Albanians of Kosovo were predominantly Christian and Albanians and Serbs for the most part co-existed peacefully. The Ottomans appeared to have a more deliberate approach to converting the Roman Catholic population of whom were mostly Albanians as compared to adherents of Eastern Orthodoxy who were mostly Serbs, as they viewed the former less favorably due to its allegiance to Rome, a competing regional power.<ref name="Cohen" />

Many Albanians gained prominent positions in the Ottoman government. "Albanians had little cause of unrest", according to author Dennis Hupchik. "If anything, they grew important in Ottoman internal affairs."<ref name="hupchik">''The Balkans. From Constantinople to Communism'', Dennis Hupchik</ref> In the 19th century, there was an [[Rise of nationalism under the Ottoman Empire|awakening]] of [[ethnic nationalism]] throughout the Balkans.

In 1878 the [[League of Prizren]] ({{lang|sq|Lidhja e Prizrenit}}) was formed.
This was a political organisation that sought to unify all the Albanians of the Ottoman Empire in a common struggle for autonomy and greater cultural rights,<ref>''Kosovo: What Everyone Needs to Know'' by Tim Judah, Publisher [[Oxford University Press]], US, 2008 {{ISBN|0-19-537673-0|978-0-19-537673-9}} p. 36</ref> although they generally desired the continuation of the Ottoman Empire.<ref>Cirkovic. p. 244 "Since Islamicised Albanians represented a significant portion of the Ottoman armed forces and administration, they did not give up the Empire easily."</ref> The League was dis-established in 1881 but enabled the awakening of a [[nation|national identity]] among Albanians.<ref>George Gawlrych, ''The Crescent and the Eagle,'' (Palgrave/Macmilan, London, 2006), {{ISBN|1-84511-287-3}}</ref> Albanian ambitions competed with those of the Serbs.

The [[Young Turk]] movement took control of the Ottoman Empire after a coup in 1912 which deposed Sultan [[Abdul Hamid&nbsp;II]]. The movement supported a centralised form of government and opposed any sort of autonomy desired by the various nationalities of the Ottoman Empire. An allegiance to [[Ottomanism]] was promoted instead.<ref>Erik Zurcher, Ottoman sources of Kemalist thought, (New York, Routledge, 2004), p. 19.</ref> An Albanian uprising in 1912 exposed the empire's northern territories in Kosovo and [[Novi Pazar]], which led to an invasion by the [[Kingdom of Montenegro]].

The Albanians threatened to march all the way to [[Salonika]] and reimpose Abdul Hamid.<ref>Noel Malcolm, A short history of Kosovo, (London, 1998), p. 248.</ref>

A wave of Albanians in the [[Military of the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman army]] ranks also deserted during this period, refusing to fight their own kin. In September 1912, a joint Balkan force made up of Serbian, Montenegrin, Bulgarian and Greek forces drove the Ottomans out of most of their European possessions. The rise of nationalism hampered relations between Albanians and [[Serbs in Kosovo]], due to influence from Russians, Austrians and Ottomans.<ref>See: Isa Blumi, ''Rethinking the Late Ottoman Empire: A Comparative Social and Political History of Albania and Yemen, 1878–1918''

In the winter of 1915–16, during [[World War I]], Kosovo saw the retreat of the Serbian army as Kosovo was occupied by [[Bulgaria]] and [[Austria–Hungary|Austria-Hungary]]. In 1918, the Allied Powers pushed the [[Central Powers]] out of Kosovo. After the end of World War I, the Kingdom of Serbia was transformed into the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenians]] on 1 December 1918.

Kosovo was split into four counties, three being a part of Serbia ([[Zvečan]], Kosovo and southern [[Metohija]]) and one of Montenegro (northern Metohija). However, the new administration system since 26 April 1922 split Kosovo among three districts ([[oblast]]) of the Kingdom: Kosovo, Raška and Zeta. In 1929, the country was transformed into the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] and the territories of Kosovo were reorganised among the [[Zeta Banovina|Banate of Zeta]], the [[Morava Banovina|Banate of Morava]] and the [[Vardar Banovina|Banate of Vardar]]. In order to change the [[Demographics of Kosovo|ethnic composition of Kosovo]], between 1912 and 1941 a [[Colonisation of Kosovo|large-scale Serbian re-colonisation of Kosovo]] was undertaken by the Belgrade government. Meanwhile, Kosovar Albanians' right to receive education in their own language was denied alongside other non-Slavic or unrecognised Slavic nations of Yugoslavia, as the kingdom only recognised the Slavic Croat, Serb, and Slovene nations as constituent nations of Yugoslavia, while other Slavs had to identify as one of the three official Slavic nations while non-Slav nations were only deemed as minorities.<ref name = "Schabnel 2001 20"/>

After the [[Axis invasion of Yugoslavia]] in 1941, most of Kosovo was assigned to Italian-controlled Albania, with the rest being controlled by Germany and Bulgaria. A three-dimensional conflict ensued, involving inter-ethnic, ideological, and international affiliations, with the first being most important. Nonetheless, these conflicts were relatively low-level compared with other areas of Yugoslavia during the war years, with one Serb historian estimating that 3,000 Albanians and 4,000 Serbs and Montenegrins were killed, and two others estimating war dead at 12,000 Albanians and 10,000 Serbs and Montenegrins.<ref>Malcolm, Noel ''Kosovo: A Short History'', p. 312</ref> An official investigation conducted by the Yugoslav government in 1964 recorded nearly 8,000 war-related fatalities in Kosovo between 1941 and 1945, 5,489 of whom were Serb and Montenegrin and 2,177 of whom were Albanian.<ref>{{cite book|last = Frank|first = Chaim|editor1-last = Petersen|editor1-first = Hans-Christian|editor2-last = Salzborn|editor2-first = Samuel|year = 2010|title = Antisemitism in Eastern Europe: History and Present in Comparison|publisher = Peter Lang|location = [[Bern]]|isbn = 978-3-631-59828-3|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=k6sqlTGHpsAC|pages = 97–98|url-status=live|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151016003257/https://books.google.com/books?id=k6sqlTGHpsAC|archive-date = 16 October 2015|df = dmy-all}}</ref> It is not disputed that between 1941 and 1945 tens of thousands of Serbs, mostly recent colonists, fled from Kosovo.

=== Communist Yugoslavia ===
{{Main|Socialist Autonomous Province of Kosovo}}
[[File:Flag of SFR Yugoslav Albanian Minority.svg|thumb|240px|The flag of the Albanian Minority of Kosovo in the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]]
The province as in its outline today first took shape in 1945 as the ''Autonomous Kosovo-Metohian Area''. Until World War II, the only entity bearing the name of Kosovo had been a political unit carved from the former [[vilayet]] which bore no special significance to its internal population. In the [[Ottoman Empire]] (which previously controlled the territory), it had been a vilayet with its borders having been revised on several occasions. When the [[Kosovo Province, Ottoman Empire|Ottoman province]] had last existed, it included areas which were by now either ceded to [[Albania]], or found themselves within the newly created Yugoslav republics of [[SR Montenegro|Montenegro]], or [[SR Macedonia|Macedonia]] (including its previous capital, [[Skopje]]) with another part in the [[Sandžak]] region of southwest Serbia.

Tensions between ethnic Albanians and the Yugoslav government were significant, not only due to ethnic tensions but also due to political ideological concerns, especially regarding relations with neighbouring Albania.<ref name="Kosovo. 2000.

After the ouster of Ranković in 1966, the agenda of pro-decentralisation reformers in Yugoslavia, especially from Slovenia and Croatia, succeeded in the late 1960s in attaining substantial decentralisation of powers, creating substantial autonomy in Kosovo and Vojvodina, and recognising a [[Bosniaks|Muslim Yugoslav]] nationality.<ref name="Melissa Katherine Bokovoy 1992.

[[File:SocialistYugoslavia en.svg|240px|thumb|Republics and provinces of the SFR Yugoslavia.]]
In the aftermath of the 1974 constitution, concerns over the rise of Albanian nationalism in Kosovo rose with the widespread celebrations in 1978 of the 100th anniversary of the founding of the [[League of Prizren]].<ref name="Kosovo. 2000.

Due to very high [[birth rate]]s, the proportion of Albanians increased from 75% to over 90%. In contrast, the number of Serbs barely increased, and in fact dropped from 15% to 8% of the total population, since many Serbs departed from Kosovo as a response to the tight economic climate and increased incidents with their Albanian neighbours. While there was tension, charges of "genocide" and planned harassment have been debunked as an excuse to revoke Kosovo's autonomy. For example, in 1986 the [[Serbian Orthodox Church]] published an official claim that Kosovo Serbs were being subjected to an Albanian program of 'genocide'.<ref name="books.google.com">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ap8wa_YmT2QC&pg=PA215 |title=Religion and the Creation of Race and Ethnicity: An Introduction |publisher=New York University Press |access-date=20 July 2009 |isbn=978-0-8147-6701-6 |editor-last=Prentiss |editor-first=Craig R |year=2003}}</ref>

====Kosovar language====
After the [[Tito–Stalin split|Tito-Stalin rift]] in 1948, the relations between Stalinist Albania and Yugoslavia were also broken. [[Language policy]] was of utmost importance in communist Yugoslavia, which after World War II was reorganised as a [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|federation of ethnolinguistically defined nations]], in emulation of the [[Korenizatsiya|interwar Soviet nationalities policy]]. For instance, in 1944, the [[Macedonian language]] was proclaimed for the sake of distancing former [[Vardar Banovina]], which was [[World War II in Yugoslav Macedonia|incorporated into wartime Bulgaria]], from [[Bulgarian language]] and culture. Likewise, in postwar Yugoslavia's [[Socialist Autonomous Province of Kosovo]], the local [[Albanian language]] was distanced from Albania's standard steeped in [[Tosk Albanian|Tosk]], by basing it on the Kosovar dialect of [[Gheg Albanian|Gheg]]. As a result, a standard Kosovar language was formed. However, after the rapprochement between Albania and Yugoslavia at the turn of the 1970s, Belgrade adopted Albania's Tosk-based standard of the Albanian language, which ended the brief flourishing of the Gheg-based Kosovar language.<ref>[https://www.academia.edu/29940833/The_Idea_of_a_Kosovan_Language_in_Yugoslavia_s_Language_Politics_pp_217-237_._International_Journal_of_the_Sociology_of_Language._Vol_242._DOI_10.1515_ijsl-2016-0040 Tomasz Kamusella. 2016.

On 10 June 1999, the UN Security Council passed [[UN Security Council Resolution 1244]], which placed Kosovo under transitional UN administration (UNMIK) and authorised [[Kosovo Force]] (KFOR), a NATO-led peacekeeping force. Resolution 1244 provided that Kosovo would have autonomy within the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, and affirmed the [[territorial integrity]] of Yugoslavia, which has been legally succeeded by the Republic of Serbia.<ref>{{cite news |title=Resolution 1244 (1999) |date=17 June 1999 |work=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/371562.stm |access-date=19 February 2008 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080407233507/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/371562.stm |archive-date=7 April 2008}}</ref>

International negotiations began in 2006 to determine the final status of Kosovo, as envisaged under [[UN Security Council Resolution 1244]]. The UN-backed talks, led by UN [[Diplomatic rank|Special Envoy]] [[Martti Ahtisaari]], began in February 2006.

In February 2007, Ahtisaari delivered a draft status settlement proposal to leaders in Belgrade and Pristina, the basis for a draft [[United Nations Security Council Resolution|UN Security Council Resolution]] which proposed 'supervised independence' for the province.

After many weeks of discussions at the UN, the United States, United Kingdom and other European members of the Security Council formally 'discarded' a draft resolution backing Ahtisaari's proposal on 20 July 2007, having failed to secure Russian backing. Beginning in August, a "[[wikt:troika|Troika]]" consisting of negotiators from the European Union ([[Wolfgang Ischinger]]), the United States ([[Frank G.

The Serb minority of Kosovo, which largely opposes the declaration of independence, has formed the [[Community of Serb Municipalities|Community Assembly of Kosovo and Metohija]] in response.

On 8 October 2008, the UN General Assembly resolved, on a proposal by Serbia, to ask the International Court of Justice to render an advisory opinion on the legality of Kosovo's declaration of independence. The advisory opinion, which is not binding over decisions by states to recognise or not recognise Kosovo, was rendered on 22 July 2010, holding that Kosovo's declaration of independence was not in violation either of general principles of international law, which do not prohibit unilateral declarations of independence, nor of specific international law&nbsp;– in particular UNSCR 1244&nbsp;– which did not define the final status process nor reserve the outcome to a decision of the Security Council.<ref name="icj-cij">{{cite web|url=http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/index.php?p1=3&p2=4&code=kos&case=141&k=21|title=Advisory Proceedings&nbsp;&#124;&nbsp;International Court of Justice|publisher=icj-cij.org|access-date=3 March 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140208141833/http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/index.php?p1=3&p2=4&code=kos&case=141&k=21|archive-date=8 February 2014}}</ref>

Kosovo is a [[multi-party system|multi-party]] [[parliamentary system|parliamentary]] [[representative democracy|representative democratic]] [[parliamentary republic|republic]]. It is governed by [[legislative]], [[Executive (government)|executive]] and [[Judiciary|judicial]] institutions, which derive from the [[Constitution of Kosovo|constitution]], although, until the [[Brussels Agreement (2013)|Brussels Agreement]], North Kosovo was in practice largely controlled by institutions of Serbia or parallel institutions funded by Serbia. Legislative functions are vested in both the [[Assembly of Kosovo|Parliament]] and the ministers within their competencies. The [[Government of Kosovo|Government]] exercises the executive power and is composed of the [[Prime Minister of Kosovo|Prime Minister]] as the [[head of government]], the Deputy Prime Ministers and the Ministers of the various ministries.

The judiciary is composed of the Supreme Court and subordinate courts, a [[Constitutional Court of Kosovo|Constitutional Court]], and independent prosecutorial institutions. There also exist multiple independent institutions defined by the constitution and law, as well as local governments. It specifies that Kosovo is a "[[secular state]]" and neutral in matters of religious beliefs. Freedom of belief, conscience and religion is guaranteed with religious autonomy ensured and protected. All citizens are equal before the law and [[gender equality]] is ensured by the constitution.<ref name="ReferenceA">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WX4hAwAAQBAJ&q=kosovo%20no%20official%20religion&pg=PA167|title=The Road to Independence for Kosovo: A Chronicle of the Ahtisaari Plan|first=Henry H. |last=Perritt Jr|date=2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|via=Google Books|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180216082458/https://books.google.com/books?id=WX4hAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA167&lpg=PA167#v=onepage&q=kosovo%20no%20official%20religion|archive-date=16 February 2018|isbn=9781139479431}}</ref><ref name="ReferenceB">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R1vU9p9ftlsC&q=kosovo%20constitution%20article%207&pg=PA235|title=Legislating for Equality: A Multinational Collection of Non-Discrimination Norms.

The [[President of Kosovo|president]] serves as the [[head of state]] and represents the unity of the people, elected every five years, indirectly by the parliament through a [[secret ballot]] by a two-thirds majority of all deputies. The head of state invested primarily with representative responsibilities and powers. The president has the power to return draft legislation to the parliament for reconsideration and has a role in foreign affairs and certain official appointments.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.constituteproject.org/constitution/Kosovo_2016.pdf |title=Kosovo's Constitution of 2008 (with Amendments through 2016), chapter V |via=constituteproject.org}}</ref> The [[Prime Minister of Kosovo|Prime Minister]] serves as the [[head of government]] elected by the parliament.

Corruption is a major problem and an obstacle to the development of democracy in the country. Those in the judiciary appointed by the government to fighting corruption are often government associates. Moreover, prominent politicians and party operatives who commit offences are not prosecuted due to the lack of laws and political will. Organized crime also poses a threat to the economy due to the practices of bribery, extortion and racketeering.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Phillips |first1=David L. |title=Liberating Kosovo: Coercive Diplomacy and U.

Kosovo scored better in the area of militarization, which is affected negatively by the purchase of armament and militarization.<ref>{{cite book |title=Global Peace Index 2020: Measuring Peace in a Complex World |url= http://visionofhumanity.org/reports |format=PDF |publisher=Institute for Economics & Peace |place=Sydney |year=2020 }}</ref>

{{See also|EULEX}}

[[File:KP-PK During Kosovo Independence Parade.JPG|thumb|The [[Kosovo Police|Kosovan Police]] (''Policia e Kosovës'') is the main law enforcement agency in Kosovo.]]

The judicial system of Kosovo is a civil law system divided between courts with regular civil and criminal jurisdiction and administrative courts with jurisdiction over litigation between individuals and the public administration. As of the [[Constitution of Kosovo]], the judicial system is composed of the Supreme Court, which is the highest judicial authority, a [[Constitutional Court of Kosovo|Constitutional Court]], and an independent prosecutorial institution. All of them are administered by the [[Kosovo Judicial Council|Judicial Council]] located in [[Pristina]]. The [[Kosovo Police]] is the main state law enforcement agency in the nation. After the Independence of Kosovo in 2008, the force became the governmental agency. The agency carries nearly all general police duties such as criminal investigation, patrol activity, traffic policing, border control.

The [[Ahtisaari Plan]] envisaged two forms of international supervision of Kosovo after its independence such as the [[International Civilian Office]] (ICO), which would monitor the implementation of the Plan and would have a wide range of veto powers over legislative and executive actions, and the [[EULEX|European Union Rule of Law Mission to Kosovo]] (EULEX), which would have the narrower mission of deploying police and civilian resources with the aim of developing the Kosovo Police and judicial systems but also with its own powers of arrest and prosecution.
The declaration of independence and subsequent Constitution granted these bodies the powers assigned to them by the Ahtisaari Plan. Since the Plan was not voted on by the UN Security Council, the ICO's legal status within Kosovo was dependent on the de facto situation and Kosovo legislation; it was supervised by an [[International Steering Group]] (ISG) composed of the main states which recognised Kosovo. It was never recognised by Serbia or other non-recognising states. EULEX was also initially opposed by Serbia, but its mandate and powers were accepted in late 2008 by Serbia and the UN Security Council as operating under the umbrella of the continuing UNMIK mandate, in a status-neutral way, but with its own operational independence. The ICO's existence terminated on 10 September 2012, after the ISG had determined that Kosovo had substantially fulfilled its obligations under the Ahtisaari Plan. EULEX continues its existence under both Kosovo and international law; in 2012 the Kosovo president formally requested a continuation of its mandate until 2014.

Defined in a total area of {{convert|10887|km2|0|abbr=off}}, Kosovo is landlocked and located in the center of the [[Balkan Peninsula]] in [[Southeastern Europe]].

Most of the borders of Kosovo are dominated by mountainous and high terrain. The most noticeable [[Topography|topographical]] features are the [[Prokletije]] and the [[Šar Mountains]]. The Prokletije, are a geological continuation of the [[Dinaric Alps]]. The mountains run laterally through the west along the border with [[Albania]] and [[Montenegro]]. The southeast is predominantly the Šar Mountains, which constitute the border with [[North Macedonia]]. Besides the mountain ranges, Kosovo's territory consists mostly of two major plains, the [[Kosovo Plain]] in the east and the [[Metohija|Metohija Plain]] in the west.

Kosovo's hydrological resources are relatively small. The longest rivers of Kosovo include the [[White Drin]], the [[South Morava]] and the [[Ibar River|Ibar]]. [[Sitnica]], a tributary of Ibar, is the largest river lying completely within Kosovo's territory. River [[Nerodimka (river)|Nerodimka]] represents Europe's only instance of a river bifurcation flowing into the [[Black Sea]] and [[Aegean Sea]].

Albanians, steadily increasing in number, may have constituted a majority in Kosovo since the 19th century, although the region's historical ethnic composition is disputed.

[[Christianity in Kosovo|Christianity]] has a long and continuous history in Kosovo which can be traced back to the [[State church of the Roman Empire|Roman]] invasion of the region. During the early and late Middle Ages, the entire [[Balkan Peninsula]] had been [[Christianised]] initially by the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] and subsequently by the [[Byzantine Empire]]. Followers of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] are predominantly Albanians with ethnic Serbs following the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]. In 2008, Protestant pastor Artur Krasniqi, primate of the Kosovo Protestant Evangelical Church, claimed that "as many as 15,000" Kosovar Albanians had converted to Protestantism since 1985.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/europe/2008/12/30/conversion-rate|title=Conversion rate|date=30 December 2008|work=The Economist|access-date=25 December 2018|issn=0013-0613}}</ref>

The relations between the Albanian Muslim and Albanian Roman Catholic communities in Kosovo are considered good, however both communities have few or no relations with the [[Serbian Orthodox Church|Serbian Orthodox]] community. In general, the Albanians define their [[ethnicity]] by [[language]] and not by religion, while religion reflects a distinguishing identity feature among the Slavs of Kosovo and elsewhere.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Religion in Kosovo |date=2001 |location=Pristina and Brussels |page=3 |edition=International Crisis Group |language=de}}</ref>

The [[economy of Kosovo]] is a transitional economy. It suffered from the combined results of political upheaval, the Serbian dismissal of Kosovo employees and the following [[Yugoslav Wars]]. Despite declining foreign assistance, the GDP has mostly grown since its declaration of independence. This was despite the [[financial crisis of 2007–2008]] and the subsequent [[European debt crisis]]. Additionally, the [[inflation rate]] has been low. Most economic development has taken place in the trade, retail and construction sectors. Kosovo is highly dependent on remittances from the [[Albanian diaspora|diaspora]], [[Foreign direct investment|FDI]] and other capital inflows.<ref name="IMF Country Report No 12/100"> '' IMF Country Report No 12/100 '' {{cite web |url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/scr/2012/cr12100.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=4 October 2012 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924054059/http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/scr/2012/cr12100.pdf |archive-date=24 September 2015}} "Unemployment, around 40% of the population, is a significant problem that encourages outward migration and black market activity."</ref> Kosovo is one of the poorest countries in Europe.

[[File:Brezovica run.jpg|thumb|[[Brezovica ski resort]] is one of the most visited winter tourist destinations in Kosovo.]]

The natural values of Kosovo represent quality tourism resources. The description of Kosovo's potential in tourism is closely related to its geographical location, in the center of the [[Balkan Peninsula]] in [[Southeastern Europe]]. It represents a crossroads which historically dates back to [[Classical antiquity|antiquity]]. Kosovo serves as a link in the connection between [[Central Europe|Central]] and [[Southern Europe]] and the [[Adriatic Sea]] and [[Black Sea]]. The mountainous west and southeast of Kosovo has great potential for winter tourism. Skiing takes place at the winter resort of [[Brezovica ski resort|Brezovica]] within the [[Šar Mountains]].<ref name=turizmi>{{cite web|title= Investing in Kosovo|url= http://www.eciks.org/english/publications/InvestinginKosovo_2011_Web.pdf|page= 15|access-date= 27 February 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20131104072918/http://www.eciks.org/english/publications/InvestinginKosovo_2011_Web.pdf|archive-date= 4 November 2013|df= dmy-all}}</ref>

Kosovo is generally rich in various topographical features, including high [[mountain]]s, [[lake]]s, [[canyon]]s, steep [[rock formation]]s and [[river]]s.<ref name=turizmi /> [[Brezovica ski resort]], with the close proximity to the [[Pristina Airport]] (60&nbsp;km) and [[Skopje International Airport]] (70&nbsp;km), is a possible destination for international tourists. Other major attractions include the capital, [[Pristina]], the historical cities of [[Prizren]], [[Peja]] and [[Gjakova]] but also [[Ferizaj]] and [[Gjilan]].

[[File:Prishtina International Airport "Adem Jashari" Limak Kosovo.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Pristina International Airport]] (PRN) handles more than 2.1&nbsp;million passengers per year.]]

Currently, there are two main motorways in Kosovo: the [[Albania–Kosovo Highway|R7]] connecting Kosovo with [[Albania]] and the [[R6 Motorway (Kosovo)|R6]] connecting [[Pristina]] with the Macedonian border at [[Elez Han]]. The construction of the new [[R7.1 Motorway (Kosovo)|R7.1 Motorway]] began in 2017.

The [[R7 Motorway (Kosovo)|R7 Motorway]] (part of [[Albania-Kosovo Highway]]) links Kosovo to [[Albania]]'s [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]] coast in [[Durrës]]. Once the remaining [[European route E80|European route (E80)]] from [[Pristina]] to [[Merdare]] section project will be completed, the motorway will link Kosovo through the present [[European route E80|European route (E80)]] highway with the [[Pan-European corridor X]] ([[European route E75|E75]]) near [[Niš]] in Serbia. The [[R6 Motorway (Kosovo)|R6 Motorway]] is currently under construction. Forming part of the [[European route E65|E65]], it is the second motorway constructed in the region and it links the capital [[Pristina]] with the border with North Macedonia at [[Elez Han]], which is about {{convert|20|km|abbr=on}} from [[Skopje]]. Construction of the motorway started in 2014 and it is going to be finished in 2018.

The nation hosts two airports, [[Gjakova Airport]] and [[Pristina International Airport]]. Gjakova Airport was built by the [[Kosovo Force]] (KFOR) following the [[Kosovo War]], next to an existing airfield used for agricultural purposes, and was used mainly for military and humanitarian flights. The local and national government plans to offer Gjakova Airport for operation under a public-private partnership with the aim of turning it into a civilian and commercial airport.<ref>{{cite web|title=Aktivitetet e Ministrisë së Tregtisë dhe Industrisë: Themelohet Ndërmarrja Publike 'Aeroporti i Gjakovës'|url=http://www.mti-ks.org/sq/Aktivitetet-e-MTI-se/Themelohet-Ndermarrja-Publike-Aeroporti-i-Gjakoves-2882-2882|publisher=Ministria e Tregtisë dhe Industrisë|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150227170445/http://www.mti-ks.org/sq/Aktivitetet-e-MTI-se/Themelohet-Ndermarrja-Publike-Aeroporti-i-Gjakoves-2882-2882|archive-date=27 February 2015}}</ref> Pristina International Airport is located southwest of [[Pristina]].

{{see also|Education in Kosovo}}
[[File:Academy of Sciences and Arts of Kosovo February 2013.jpg|thumb|The [[Academy of Sciences and Arts of Kosovo|Academy of Sciences and Arts]] in [[Pristina]]. Honorary members include the [[Albanian Americans|Albanian-American]] Nobel Prize winner [[Ferid Murad]] and the [[Albanians in the Republic of Macedonia|Albanian]] [[Roman Catholic]] nun [[Mother Teresa]].]]

Education for primary, secondary, and tertiary levels is predominantly public and supported by the state, run by the [[Ministry of Education, Science and Technology (Kosovo)|Ministry of Education]]. Education takes place in two main stages: primary and secondary education and higher education.

The primary and secondary education is subdivided into four stages: preschool education, primary and low secondary education, high secondary education and special education. Preschool education is for children from the ages of one to five. Primary and secondary education is obligatory for everyone. It is provided by gymnasiums and vocational schools and also available in languages of recognised minorities in Kosovo, where classes are held in [[Albanian language|Albanian]], Serbian, [[Bosnian language|Bosnian]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]] and [[Croatian language|Croatian]]. The first phase (primary education) includes grades one to five, and the second phase (low secondary education) grades six to nine. The third phase (high secondary education) consists of general education but also professional education, which is focused on different fields. It lasts four years. However, pupils are offered possibilities of applying for higher or university studies. According to the [[Ministry of Education, Science and Technology (Kosovo)|Ministry of Education]], children who are not able to get a general education are able to get a special education (fifth phase).<ref>{{cite web|title=Elementary and secondary education|url=https://www.rks-gov.net/en-US/Qytetaret/Edukimi/Pages/ArsimiFillorDheMesem.aspx|website=rks-gov.net|language=en|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160818111807/https://www.rks-gov.net/en-US/Qytetaret/Edukimi/Pages/ArsimiFillorDheMesem.aspx|archive-date=18 August 2016|access-date=14 April 2017}}</ref>

Higher education can be received in universities and other higher-education institutes. These educational institutions offer studies for [[Bachelor's degree|Bachelor]], [[Master's degree|Master]] and [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] degrees. The students may choose full-time or part-time studies.

[[File:Prishtina and the great Hamam.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Great Hamam of Pristina]] was built in the 15th century and was part of the [[Imperial Mosque (Pristina)|Imperial Mosque]] in [[Pristina]].]]

The architecture of Kosovo dates back to the [[Neolithic]], [[Bronze Age|Bronze]] and [[Middle Age]]s. It has been influenced by the presence of different civilisations and religions as evidenced by the structures which have survived to this day.

Kosovo is home to many [[Monastery|monasteries]] and churches from the 13th and 14th centuries that represent the [[Serbian Orthodox Church|Serbian Orthodox]] legacy. Architectural heritage from the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Period]] includes mosques and [[Turkish bath|hamams]] from the 15th, 16th and 17th centuries. Other historical architectural structures of interest include [[Monuments of Kosovo|kullas]] from the 18th and 19th centuries, as well as a number of bridges, urban centers and fortresses. While some [[Vernacular architecture|vernacular buildings]] are not considered important in their own right, taken together they are of considerable interest. During the [[Kosovo War|1999 conflict in Kosovo]], many buildings that represent this heritage were destroyed or damaged.<ref name=":1">{{cite journal|title=Prioritized Intervention List|journal=Regional Programme for Cultural and Natural Heritage in South-east Europe|date=23 January 2009|page=8|url=http://www.coe.int/t/dg4/cultureheritage/cooperation/see/countries/kosovo_en.asp|access-date=2 March 2014|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140302202142/http://www.coe.int/t/dg4/cultureheritage/cooperation/see/countries/kosovo_en.asp|archive-date=2 March 2014}}</ref><ref name="unesco.org">{{cite journal|title=Cultural Heritage in South-East: Kosovo|journal=United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|page=5|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/venice/culture/safeguarding-cultural-heritage/capacity-building/cultural-heritage-kosovo/|access-date=2 March 2014|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322132708/http://www.unesco.org/new/en/venice/culture/safeguarding-cultural-heritage/capacity-building/cultural-heritage-kosovo/|archive-date=22 March 2014}}</ref> In the Dukagjini region, at least 500 kullas were attacked, and most of them destroyed or otherwise damaged.<ref name=":0" />

In 2004, [[UNESCO]] recognised the [[Visoki Dečani|Visoki Dečani monastery]] as [[World Heritage Site]] for its outstanding universal value. Two years later, the site of patrimony was extended as a serial nomination, to include three other religious monuments: [[Patriarchate of Peć (monastery)|Patriarchate of Peja]], [[Our Lady of Ljeviš]] and [[Gračanica monastery]] under the name of [[Medieval Monuments in Kosovo]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Medieval Monuments in Kosovo|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/724|publisher=[[UNESCO]]|date=2006|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150513120313/https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/724/|archive-date=13 May 2015}}</ref> It consists of four [[Serbian Orthodox Church|Serbian Orthodox]] churches and [[Serbian monasteries|monasteries]], which represent the fusion of the eastern Orthodox [[Byzantine architecture|Byzantine]] and the western [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] ecclesiastical architecture to form the Palaiologian Renaissance style. The construction was founded by members of [[Nemanjić dynasty]], the most important dynasty of [[Serbia in the Middle Ages]].

These monuments have come under attack, especially during the [[2004 unrest in Kosovo|2004 ethnic violence]].

Kosovan art was unknown to the international public for a very long time, because of the regime, many artists were unable to display their art in art galleries, and so were always on the lookout for alternatives, and even resorted to taking matters into their own hands. Until 1990, artists from Kosovo presented their art in many prestigious worldwide renowned centers. They were affirmed and evaluated highly because of their unique approach to the arts considering the circumstances in which they were created, making them distinguished and original.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dmu.ac.uk/about-dmu/news/2015/august/photography-academic-invited-by-president-to-attend-ceremony-for-popstar-rita-ora.aspx|title=Photography academic invited by President to attend ceremony for popstar Rita Ora|website=www.dmu.ac.uk|language=en-gb|access-date=9 May 2018}}</ref><ref name="Congress2010">{{cite book|author=Library of Congress|title=Library of Congress Subject Headings|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ij47KwlCAykC&pg=PA4303|year=2010|publisher=Library of Congress|pages=4303–}}</ref>

In February 1979, the [[Kosova National Art Gallery]] was founded. It became the highest institution of visual arts in Kosovo.

=== Cuisine ===
{{main|Kosovan cuisine}}

[[File:Ushqim Tradicional Flija.JPG|thumb|right|[[Flia]] is one of the most favored dishes of the traditional [[Albanian cuisine]] in Kosovo.]]

The [[Kosovan cuisine]] is mixed with influences of the [[Kosovo Albanians|Albanian]] and [[Kosovo Serbs|Serbian]] origins of its majority population. Located at the crossroad of [[Albanian people|Albanian]], [[Ottoman people|Ottoman]], [[Italic peoples|Romance]] and [[Slavic people|Slavic]] cultures, Kosovo has enriched its own cuisine adopting and maintaining some of their cooking traditions and techniques.

Food is an important component in the social life of the people of Kosovo particularly during [[religious holiday]]s such as [[Christmas]], [[Easter]] and [[Ramadan]]. For festive occasions, [[Baklava]], [[Turkish delight|Lokum]] and [[Halva]] are traditionally prepared in almost every household throughout Kosovo and the [[Balkans]] regardless of ethnicity or cultural identity.<ref>http://rebibneenun.blogdetik.com/embelsira-kosovare/{{Dead link|date=February 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

Perhaps the most prominent and traditional examples of Kosovan food include the [[Flia]] and Pite which are served with assorted [[vegetable]]s, [[fruit preserves]], honey and [[yogurt]]. Flia is composed of multiple layered [[crepe]] and is predominantly brushed with cream while Pite are filled with a mixture of salty [[cheese]], [[meat]], [[potato]]es or [[leek]].

The cuisine of Kosovo features a wide range of fresh [[fruit]]s, [[vegetable]]s and [[herb]]s such as [[salt]], [[Bell pepper|red]] and [[black pepper]] and vegeta.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.podravka.com/company/markets/kosovo/tab-cuisine-of-kosovo |title=Cuisine of Kosovo |website=Podravka |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130528131108/http://www.podravka.com/company/markets/kosovo/tab-cuisine-of-kosovo |archive-date=28 May 2013 |access-date=6 June 2013}}</ref>{{Better source|reason=Citation is a food company website.|date=November 2019}} The people of Kosovo enjoy a wide variety of meat and [[fish]] products among other [[chicken]], [[beef]], [[kebab]], [[Sujuk]] and [[Lamb and mutton|lamb]] which is considered to be the traditional meat for religious occasions due to its religious connections.

[[Tea]] such as Albanian-style [[Sideritis|mountain tea]] or Russian and Turkish-style [[black tea]] are a widely consumed beverage throughout Kosovo and particularly served at cafés, restaurants or at home. [[Coffee]] is another popular drink although Kosovo is steeped in culture and their coffee culture is a big part of the modern society.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://kosovotwopointzero.com/en/coffee-culture-rooted-society/ |title=Coffee Culture Is Rooted in Our Society |last=Ondozi |first=Qerim |date=25 December 2017 |website=kosovotwopointzero.com |language=en}}</ref>{{Better source|reason=Citation is an opinion piece.|date=November 2019}}

Sport is a significant component of the society and culture of Kosovo. The most prominent sports in Kosovo include [[association football|football]], [[basketball]], [[judo]], [[boxing]], [[volleyball]] and [[handball]]. The [[Olympic Committee of Kosovo]] became a full member of the [[International Olympic Committee]] in 2014.<ref name="Olympic recognition">{{Cite news |url=http://www.olympic.org/news/127th-ioc-session-comes-to-close-in-monaco/242155 |title=127th IOC Session comes to close in Monaco |date=9 December 2014 |work=olympic.org |access-date=9 December 2014 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150104235120/http://www.olympic.org/news/127th-ioc-session-comes-to-close-in-monaco/242155 |archive-date=4 January 2015}}</ref> It participated at the [[2015 European Games]] in [[Azerbaijan]], [[2019 European Games]] in [[Minsk]] and the [[2016 Summer Olympics]] in [[Brazil]].

During the [[Cold War]] era from 1945 until 1991, football in [[former Yugoslavia]] advanced so rapidly that in 1946, the [[Football Federation of Kosovo|Federation of Kosovo]] was formed as a subsidiary of the Federation of Yugoslavia. Prishtina were the nation's most successful club during that period, spending five years in the top-tier [[Yugoslav First League]] and reaching the semi-finals of the [[1987-88 Yugoslav Cup]]. In 1991, an unsanctioned Kosovar league system known as the ''Liga e Pavarur e Kosovës'' ("Independent League of Kosovo") was set up, running parallel to the official Yugoslav leagues; in 1999, in the wake of the [[Kosovo War]], this became [[Ipko Superliga|Kosovo's official league system]].<ref name="History of Football in Kosovo">{{Cite web |url=http://korneri.net/?p=60042 |title=Historia e futbollit në Kosovë! |date=20 November 2013 |website=Korneri.net |language=sq |trans-title=History of Football in Kosovo |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140302195907/http://korneri.net/?p=60042 |archive-date=2 March 2014 |access-date=2 March 2014}}</ref>

The film industry of Kosovo dates from the 1970s. In 1969, the parliament of Kosovo established ''Kosovafilm'', a state institution for the production, distribution and showing of films. Its initial director was the actor Abdurrahman Shala, followed by writer and noted poet Azem Shkreli, under whose direction the most successful films were produced. Subsequent directors of Kosovafilm were Xhevar Qorraj, Ekrem Kryeziu and Gani Mehmetaj. After producing seventeen feature films, numerous short films and documentaries, the institution was taken over by the Serbian authorities in 1990 and dissolved. Kosovafilm was reestablished after [[FR Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] withdrawal from the region in June 1999 and has since been endeavoring to revive the film industry in Kosovo.

The International [[Dokufest|Documentary and Short Film Festival]] is the largest film event in Kosovo. The Festival is organised in August in [[Prizren]], which attracts numerous international and regional artists. In this annually organised festival, films are screened twice a day in three open-air cinemas as well as in two regular cinemas.
