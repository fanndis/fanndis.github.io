In the United Kingdom and the [[Crown dependencies]], any household watching or recording live television transmissions as they are being broadcast (terrestrial, satellite, cable, or Internet) is required to hold a [[television licence]]. Businesses, hospitals, schools and a range of other organisations are also required to hold television licences to watch and record live TV broadcasts.<ref name= "business">{{cite web |url=http://www.tvlicensing.co.uk/check-if-you-need-one/business-and-organisations/tv-in-the-workplace-policy-aud24 |title=Businesses and organisations |publisher=TV Licensing |access-date=14 March 2014}}</ref> The licence, originally a radio licence, was first introduced by the Wireless Telegraphy Act 1923 in November of that year at a cost of ten shillings (£0.50) per annum. The licence was extended to televisions at a cost of £2 in June 1946. The radio part was abolished in February 1971.<ref>{{cite web |title=Select Committee on Culture, Media and Sport - First Report. 5 BBC Funding |url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmselect/cmcumeds/82/8208.htm |website=Publications & records |publisher=UK Parliament |access-date=23 October 2020}}</ref> A television licence is also required to receive [[video on demand]] programme services provided by the [[BBC]] (British Broadcasting Corporation) on the iPlayer catch-up service.

Since April 2020, the annual cost is £157.50 for a colour licence and £53 for a black and white licence. Income from the licence is primarily used to fund the television, radio and online services of the BBC. The total income from licence fees was £3.83 billion in 2017–18,<ref name="Financial Statements">{{cite web|url=http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/aboutthebbc/insidethebbc/reports/pdf/bbc_annualreport_201718.pdf|title=BBC Annual Report and Accounts 2017/18|publisher=BBC|access-date= 18 September 2017}}</ref> of which £655.3 million or 17.1% was provided by the government through concessions for those over the age of 75. Thus, the licence fee made up the bulk (75.7%) of the BBC's total income of £5.0627 billion in 2017–2018.<ref name="Financial Statements"/>

In May 2016, the government's [[white paper]] announced that the licence fee would rise with inflation for the first five years of the [[BBC Charter|Charter]] period, from 1 April 2017.

==Operation of the licensing system==

===Licence fee collection and use===
The TV licence fee is collected by the [[BBC]] and primarily used to fund the radio, television and online services of the BBC itself. Licence fee collection is the responsibility of the BBC's Finance and Business division.<ref name="Trust statement 2013"/> 
[[File:BBC.svg|200px|thumb|right| The BBC also operates as the TV Licensing Authority in the UK, as one of its trade names]]

Although the money is raised for its own use and collected by the BBC itself, the BBC does not directly use the collected fees. The money received is first paid into the government's [[Consolidated Fund]]. It is subsequently included in the 'vote' for the [[Department of Culture, Media and Sport]] in that year's [[Appropriation Act]], and passed back to the BBC for the running of the BBC's own services (free from [[Television commercial|commercial advertisements]]). The money also finances programming for [[S4C]] and the [[BBC World Service]], and included the running costs of [[BBC Monitoring]] at Caversham until it was relocated to London and the property sold in May 2018.

===Legal framework===
In 1991, the BBC assumed the role of TV Licensing Authority with responsibility for the collection and enforcement of the licence fee.<ref name="legal framework">{{cite web |url=http://www.tvlicensing.co.uk/about/foi-legal-framework-AB16|title=Legal framework
|access-date=20 October 2014 |publisher=TV Licensing}}</ref>

The BBC is authorised by the [[Communications Act 2003]] to collect and enforce the TV licence fee. Section 363 of the Act makes it against the law to install or use a television receiver to watch or record any television programmes as they are being broadcast without a TV Licence. Section 365 of the same Act requires the payment of the TV licence fee to the BBC.<ref name="legal framework"/>

The licence fee is formally set by the [[Department for Culture, Media and Sport|Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport]] by the use of [[statutory instruments]]. The relevant statutory instruments are the Communications (Television Licensing) Regulations 2004<ref name = "Regulations 2004">{{cite web |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2004/692/contents/made|title= The Communications (Television Licensing) Regulations 2004|access-date=4 November 2014 |publisher=www.legislation.gov.uk}}</ref> and amendments since that time such as the Communications (Television Licensing) (Amendment) Regulations 2010.<ref name="regulations 2010">{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2010/640/pdfs/uksi_20100640_en.pdf|title=SI 2010/640 ''The Communications (Television Licensing) (Amendment) Regulations 2010''|publisher=HM Stationery Office|access-date=18 January 2013}}</ref> As well as prescribing the fees, the regulations also define "television receiver" for the purposes of the law.

For people living in the Channel Islands and Isle of Man, TV licensing law is extended to their areas by [[Order in Council|Orders in Council]] made by agreement with their own governments.<ref name ="Ask script channel">{{cite web|url=https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/copy_of_ask_help_script#incoming-571034|title=Copy of Ask Help script|publisher=Whatdotheyknow.com |page=376|access-date=12 February 2015}}</ref><ref name="Perry">{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/403561/15_02_12_Consultation_document_-_TV_Licence_Enforcement_Review__2_.pdf|title=TV Licence Enforcement Review|publisher=Department for Media Culture & Sport|access-date=16 February 2015}}</ref><ref name="Tynwald">{{cite web|url=http://www.tynwald.org.im/business/pp/Reports/2011-PP-0108.pdf|title=SELECT COMMITTEE OF TYNWALD ON THE TELEVISION LICENCE FEE REPORT 2010/11|publisher=Tynwald, Isle of Man|access-date=17 February 2015}}</ref>

As part of its [[Television licensing in the United Kingdom#Licence fee enforcement|enforcement]] regime, the BBC is authorised to carry out surveillance using powers defined by the [[Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000]] and the Regulation of Investigatory Powers (British Broadcasting Corporation) Order 2001. The BBC is permitted by the latter order to use surveillance equipment to detect unlicensed use of television receivers.<ref name = "RIPA TV">{{cite web |url=http://www.tvlicensing.co.uk/about/foi-administering-the-licence-fee-AB20|title= Administering the licence fee|access-date=7 May 2015 |publisher=TV Licensing}}</ref>

As the public body responsible for issuing TV licences, licensing information held by the BBC and on the BBC's behalf by TV licensing contractors is subject to the [[Freedom of Information Act 2000]]. The BBC withholds some information on licence enforcement using exemptions under the Act; in particular, under section 31, which permits the withholding of information on crime prevention grounds and under section 43(2), which allows the BBC to retain information judged commercially sensitive.<ref name = "FOI Act">{{cite web |url=http://www.tvlicensing.co.uk/about/freedom-of-information-act-foi-AB14|title= Freedom of Information Act|access-date=7 May 2015 |publisher=TV Licensing}}</ref>

===Reclassification as a tax===
In January 2006, the [[Office for National Statistics]] (ONS) changed the classification of the licence fee from a service charge to a tax.<ref name="Select Committee 20060303">{{cite web |url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200506/ldselect/ldbbc/128/128i.pdf |title=Further Issues for BBC Charter Review |access-date=15 August 2008 |work=House of Lords Session Report |publisher=The Stationery Office Limited |date=3 March 2006 }}</ref> Explaining the change, the ONS said: "in line with the definition of a tax, the licence fee is a compulsory payment which is not paid solely for access to
BBC services. A licence is required to receive ITV, Channel 4, Channel 5, satellite, or cable". A briefing paper from the House of Commons Library described the licence fee as a [[hypothecated tax]] (i.e. one raised for a particular defined purpose).<ref name="hypothecated">{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/briefing-papers/SN01480.pdf|title=British House of Commons: Hypothecated taxation}}</ref>

===TV Licensing Management Team===
The TV Licence Management Team, which is part of the [[BBC Finance & Business|Finance and Business]] division of the BBC, oversees the TV Licensing system.<ref name="about us">{{cite web |url=http://www.tvlicensing.co.uk/about/foi-about-tv-licensing-AB15|title=About TV Licensing
|access-date=23 April 2015 |publisher=TV Licensing}}</ref> The TV Licence Management Team is based in the BBC buildings at [[White City Place]] in London. The majority of TV licensing administration and enforcement activities are carried out under contract by private companies. The TV Licence Management Team oversees the performance of the contractors.

===''TV Licensing'' brand===
The BBC pursues its licence fee collection and enforcement under the trading name ''TV Licensing'', but contracts much of the task to commercial organisations.<ref name="Who we are">{{cite web |url=http://www.tvlicensing.co.uk/about/who-we-are-AB4|title=Who we are
|access-date=20 October 2014 |publisher=TV Licensing}}</ref> ''TV Licensing'' is a trademark of the BBC used under licence by companies contracted by the BBC that administer the television licensing system.<ref name="Who we are"/> Concerning the relationship of the BBC brand with the TV Licensing brand, the BBC's position is stated as: "The TV Licensing brand is separate from the BBC brand. No link between the two brands should be made in customer facing communications, in particular, use of the BBC name and logo".<ref name="TVL letters"/> However, it also states that the rules for internal communications and communications with suppliers are different: "the name BBC TV Licensing may also be used within department names or job titles for BBC employees".<ref name="TVL letters"/>

===TV Licensing contractors and subcontractors===

====Capita====
A major contractor is [[Capita]]<ref name="IPPR"/>.

====Havas Media====

====Other contractors====
Other contractors involved in TV Licensing include [[PayPoint]] which provides over-the-counter services in the UK, and the post offices which provide the same services in the [[Isle of Man Post Office|Isle of Man]] and Channel Islands.<ref name="Trust statement 2013"/> Also involved are: AMV BBDO Inc.<ref name="proximity"/> who provide advertising services, and Fishburn Communications Inc.<ref name= "Fishburn">{{cite web|url=http://www.thisisfishburn.com/our-work/bbc|title=BBC|access-date=10 September 2014|publisher=Fishburn}}</ref> who carry out public relations.

===Duration of a TV licence===
A TV licence, once issued, is normally valid for a maximum of 12 months. The period of its validity depends on the exact day of the month it is purchased; this is because TV licences always expire at the end of a calendar month. If a licence were to be obtained in September 2014, for example, it would expire on 31 August 2015. Thus the period of validity would vary between 11 and 12 months depending how early in the month it was bought.<ref name="Duration">{{cite web|url=http://www.tvlicensing.co.uk/faqs/FAQ25|author=TV Licensing|title=How long does a TV Licence last?|access-date=8 August 2014}}</ref> If an existing licence is renewed on time, the new licence will last the full 12 months.

The BBC sometimes issues 'short dated' licences in situations when a licence is renewed after the expiry date of the previous licence. The BBC does this as it assumes that TV was being watched in the interim period between expiry and renewal. Short dated licences are set to expire 12 months after the previous expiry date.<ref name="Trust report 2011">{{cite web|title=British Broadcasting Corporation Television Licence Fee Trust Statement for the Year Ending 31 March 2011|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/247334/1234.pdf|website=www.gov.uk|publisher=UK Government|access-date=25 August 2015}}</ref>

If a UK resident aged 74 years wishes to purchase a TV Licence, they can apply for a short-term TV Licence to cover the time until they reach 75 when they become eligible for a free licence in the UK. Short-term licences for 74-year-olds are also available on the Isle of Man and [[Bailiwick of Guernsey|Guernsey]].
	 	
If a TV licence is no longer needed for an address it is possible to cancel a licence and apply for a partial refund.<ref name="cancel">{{cite web|url=http://www.tvlicensing.co.uk/check-if-you-need-one/topics/cancellations-and-refunds-top7|author=TV Licensing|title=Cancellations and refunds|access-date=8 August 2014}}</ref> The amount refunded will depend on the time left to the expiry date. Normally only full quarters (that is three consecutive calendar months) of unexpired licence period are refunded.<ref name="legislation and policy"/>
	 
The BBC may also revoke a licence under certain circumstances.<ref name="legislation and policy">{{cite web|url=http://www.tvlicensing.co.uk/about/legislation-and-policy-AB9|author=TV Licensing|title=Legislation and policy|access-date=8 August 2014}}</ref>

===Cost of a licence===
The level of the fee is decided following periodic negotiations between the UK Government and the [[BBC Trust]].<ref name="negotiations">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/bbctrust/our_work/strategy/licence_fee/licence_fee.html |title= Licence Fee |access-date=29 April 2013 |publisher=BBC Trust |date=May 2012}}</ref> 
From 1988 to 2010, the licence fee was increased annually each April<ref name ="Ask script3">{{cite web|url=https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/copy_of_ask_help_script#incoming-571034|title=Copy of Ask Help script|publisher=Whatdotheyknow.com |page=429|access-date=6 November 2014}}</ref>
Before 1988, increases in the licence fee happened at irregular intervals, sometimes a few years passing between changes. Between April 2010 and April 2017 the licence fee remained constant at £145.50 per year.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-11572171|title=TV licence frozen for six years|date=20 October 2010|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref> As of 1 April 2020, it costs £157.50 for a colour and £53 for a black and white TV Licence.

===Payment methods===
The BBC allows the following forms of payment of the licence fee:<ref name="Payment methods">{{cite web|url=http://www.tvlicensing.co.uk/pay-for-your-tv-licence/payment-methods|author=TV Licensing|title=TV Licensing – All payment methods|access-date=31 July 2014}}</ref>
* [[Direct debit]]. Payments may be made annually, quarterly or monthly.
* Debit or credit card. Annual payment.
* [[PayPoint]]. Annual payments may be made at PayPoint outlets (usually situated in shops) by cash or debit card. Monthly or weekly payments may also be made by holders of a TV Licensing payment card (see below)
* TV Licensing payment card. Holders of this card will have a payment plan showing when and how much they need to pay. Payments may be made weekly or monthly at PayPoint outlets. Payments may also be made online, by phone or by text message (with credit or debit card).
* TV Licensing savings card. This is a way for a licence fee holder to save for a subsequent licence. If enough money for the new licence is saved up, a new licence is sent automatically. Otherwise the balance has to be paid for.
* [[Cheques|Cheque]] and [[postal order]]s. Annual payments may be made by post by these methods.
* [[BACS]] electronic transfer. Annual payments for renewal licences only.

[[File:Smith Street Post Office, St. Peter Port, Guernsey.jpg|thumb|right|A Post Office in Guernsey. Unlike in the UK, TV Licences may still be purchased at Post Offices on Guernsey, Jersey and the Isle of Man.]]
The payment methods mean that the licence fee is paid for either completely or partially in advance. Annual payments require complete payment in advance. For monthly direct debit, a new licence is paid off in 6 monthly installments of just over £24 a month. Renewal licences are paid for in 12 monthly installments starting 6 months before expiry of the licence in force i.e. starting 6 months before the renewal date.<ref name="Payment methods"/> Quarterly payments made using direct debit carry an additional cost of £5.00 per year, or £1.25 a quarter, which is included in the licence fee total. This addition is described as "a small charge" in the generic letter issued by TV Licensing to those paying by direct debit, and on the TV Licensing website it is justified with: "By paying quarterly the majority of your licence is paid for as you use it. This differs from our other instalment schemes, where at least half of the licence fee is collected in advance. As a result, quarterly payments incur a small premium of £1.25 per quarter which is included in your payment."<ref name="Payment methods" /> Typically, direct debit schemes in the UK for major utilities or publicly provided services operate in a reverse way, granting a discount to direct debit payers.

In the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man, over the counter services are provided by the Post Office rather than by PayPoint outlets.<ref name="PayPoint">{{cite web|url=https://www.tvlicensing.co.uk/pay-for-your-tv-licence/payment-methods/paypoint-pay5|author=TV Licensing|title=PayPoint|access-date=3 June 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150602143223/https://www.tvlicensing.co.uk/pay-for-your-tv-licence/payment-methods/paypoint-pay5|archive-date=2 June 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Concessions===

====Over 75s ====
Between November 2000 and April 2018, TV licences were provided to people over the age of 75, through full funding by central government.<ref name="HoC Briefing 2019">{{Cite journal|last=Woodhouse|first=John|date=2019-06-13|title=Free TV licences for the over-75s|url=https://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/SN04955|publisher=House of Commons Library}}</ref> This concession covered the whole household, so that even if just one member of the household was over 75, then a free TV licence could be applied for to cover all the residents.<ref>{{cite web|title=Over 75 TV Licence|url=http://www.tvlicensing.co.uk/check-if-you-need-one/for-your-home/aged-74-and-over-aud3|access-date=31 July 2017|website=TV Licensing}}</ref> Following a 2016 funding agreement between the [[Second Cameron ministry|Conservative government]] and the BBC, this funding was phased out between April 2018 and April 2020, after which time no further government funding was available for the scheme:<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/bbctrust/assets/files/pdf/about/how_we_govern/2016/agreement.pdf|title=Broadcasting An Agreement Between Her Majesty's Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport and the British Broadcasting Corporation|date=December 2016|website=downloads.bbc.co.uk/|publisher=UK Government|page=33}}</ref> free TV licences based solely on age ended in August 2020 (previously planned to be June 2020 but extended as of the coronavirus [COVID-19] outbreak).<ref name="HoC Briefing 2019" /> It has been estimated that if full funding had been maintained, it would have contributed £745m to the BBC's 2020/21 budget.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/jul/06/bbc-pay-cost-free-tv-licences-over-75s-fee-deal|title=BBC to take on £750m cost of subsidy for over-75s in licence fee deal|newspaper=The Guardian|access-date=26 April 2016}}</ref> The BBC held a [[public consultation]] in November 2018 to decide whether the concession to the over-75s should continue after 2020 and, if so, in what form.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-46274054|title=BBC launches consultation on TV licence fee for over-75s|publisher=BBC|access-date=27 November 2018}}</ref> The response to the BBC's questionnaire, 48% were in favour of retaining the existing concessionary system, 37% preferred reforming the concession and 17% preferred the option of abolition of the concession.<ref name="AGE-RELATED TV LICENCE POLICY">{{cite web |title=AGE-RELATED TV LICENCE POLICY |url=http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/aboutthebbc/reports/consultation/age/decision-document.pdf |website=bbc.co.uk |publisher=BBC |access-date=19 June 2019}}</ref>

There are schemes for elderly residents of the [[Channel Islands]], but they vary in detail and eligibility. Residents of the islands of Guernsey, Alderney and Herm (parts of the [[Bailiwick of Guernsey]]) who are over 75 can apply for a free TV licence to cover their household. In addition, over-65s in receipt of state benefits may be eligible for the concession. However, no over-75 concessions are available for residents of [[Sark]], which is part of the Bailiwick of Guernsey. On the island of Jersey, the concessionary licences are available on a means-tested basis.

TV licence sales figures were quoted by the BBC to be 25.562 million in the year 2014/15, including 4.502 million concessionary licences for the over 75s,<ref name="BBC Trust 2015">{{cite web|title=British Broadcasting Corporation Television Licence Fee Trust Statement for the Year Ending 31 March 2015|url=http://www.tvlicensing.co.uk/ss/Satellite?blobcol=urldata&blobheadername1=content-type&blobheadervalue1=application%2Fpdf&blobkey=id&blobtable=MungoBlobs&blobwhere=1370006280827&ssbinary=true|website=www.tvlicensing.co.uk|publisher=TV Licensing|access-date=6 October 2015}}</ref> which were paid for by the UK government.

In 2014/15, the BBC estimated that there were 26.916 million licensable properties in the UK (defined as premises where live TV was being watched),<ref name="BBC Trust 2015"/> indicating that if the BBC estimates are correct, around 95% of properties are correctly licensed.
The total income generated from licence fees was £3.8302 billion in 2017–18.<ref name="Financial Statements"/>

The vast majority of TV licences are for colour TV. For example, there were 10,461 black and white TV licences in force on 31 August 2014, compared to 25,460,801 colour TV licences. The BBC has also stated that during the financial year 2013–14, a total of 41,483 blind concessionary (half-price) licences were issued in the UK of which 29 were blind concessionary black and white licences.<ref name ="Black and White">{{cite web|url=https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/active_tv_licenses#incoming-567857 |title=Active TV Licenses|publisher=www.whatdotheyknow.com |access-date=25 April 2015}}</ref>

====Channel Islands====
In January 2012, there were 36,261 colour licences in force in Jersey<ref name="evasion spreadsheet">{{Cite web|url=https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/evasion_rate_spreadsheet#comment-30327|title=Evasion rate spreadsheet - a Freedom of Information request to British Broadcasting Corporation|date=2012-07-26|access-date=2016-09-22}}</ref> as compared to 77,480 addresses (residential properties, businesses and

The comparable figures for Guernsey are 23,673 licences in force in January 2012<ref name="evasion spreadsheet"/> and 40,263 addresses on the database at the end of December 2011.<ref name="Total Channel"/> Thus there were around 41% unlicensed properties in Guernsey at the beginning of 2012.

{{See also|British Broadcasting Company|BBC}}

[[File:TV Licence 1946-2012 at NPV.png|500px|right|TV Licence 1946–2016 at 2015 prices]]  When television broadcasts in the UK were resumed after a break due to the Second World War, it was decided to introduce a television licence fee in order to fund the service. When first introduced on 1 June 1946, the licence covering the monochrome-only single-channel BBC television service cost £2 (equivalent to £{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|2|1946|{{Inflation-year|UK}}|r=2}}}} as of {{Inflation-year|UK}}).{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}} The licence was originally issued by the [[General Post Office]] (GPO), which was then the regulator of public communications within the UK. The GPO also issued licences for home radio receivers powered by mains electricity<ref name="radio licence">{{cite web|url=http://www.radiolicence.org.uk/index.html|title=The history of the UK radio licence|access-date=5 August 2014|publisher=www.radiolicence.org.uk|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140528074002/http://radiolicence.org.uk/index.html|archive-date=28 May 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> as well as non removable vehicle mounted radios and was mandated by laws beginning with the [[Wireless Telegraphy Act 1904]], to administer the licensing system; however, the TV licence also covered radio reception.

The BBC started regular colour TV broadcasts in the summer of 1967.<ref name= "history of bbc">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/historyofthebbc/wherenext/index.shtml|title=Where Next?|access-date=5 August 2014 |work=BBC Web Site |publisher=BBC}}</ref> On 1 January 1968, a "colour supplement" of £5 was added to the existing £5 monochrome licence fee; the £10 colour fee was the equivalent of £{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|10|1968|{{Inflation-year|UK}}|r=2}}}} in {{Inflation-year|UK}}. The licence fee increases with inflation; on 1 April 2019 it rose to £154.50 for colour TV and £52 for monochrome TV.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/faqs/general/licence_fee |title=Where can I find information about the licence fee?|website=BBC FAQs|date=1 April 2019  }}</ref>
The radio-only licence was abolished on 1 February 1971, when it was  £1-5s-0d (£1.25 in decimal UK currency) or the equivalent of £{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|1.25|1968|{{Inflation-year|UK}}|r=2}}}} at {{Inflation-year|UK}} prices.<ref name ="Ask script3"/>

On 1 April 1991, the BBC took over the administration of television licensing in the UK, assuming the responsibility of licence fee collection and enforcement.<ref name="legal framework"/><ref name="legal framework2">{{cite web|url=https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/legal_framework_of_licence_fee_e#incoming-185647 |title=Legal framework of Licence Fee enforcement activity|publisher=www.whatdotheyknow.com |access-date=30 December 2014}}</ref> Since this date, the BBC has been the [[statutory authority]] for issuing television licences (before April 1991, the statutory authority was the UK [[Home Office]]), although the UK Government retains certain powers and responsibilities with regards to TV licences.<ref name="legal framework2"/>

In July 2002, the BBC awarded [[Capita]] the contract to manage the TV Licensing system, replacing the Post Office (which had been renamed "Consignia" at this time).<ref name="capita contract">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2002/02_february/08/capitasigns.shtml|title=Capita Signs BBC contract for TV Licensing Account |publisher=BBC|access-date=7 April 2015}}</ref>

In January 2006 the Office of National Statistics classified the licence fee as a tax;<ref name="Select Committee 20060303"/> previously it had been classified as a service charge.

==Licence fee expenditure==
{{Further|BBC}}
The [[BBC Trust]] gives the following information for expenditure of licence fee income during the year 2009–10 of £3.56 billion<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/aboutthebbc/licencefee/ |title=How the licence fee was spent in 2009/2010 |access-date=8 April 2011 |work=BBC Web Site |publisher=BBC Trust}}</ref> (expressed here in percentage terms):

*66% – All TV
*17% – National and local radio
*6% – Online e.g. BBC websites, iPlayer
*11% – Other e.g. transmission and licence fee collection costs*

Since April 2014, the [[BBC World Service]] on radio and [[BBC Arabic Television]] have been funded from the licence fee. Prior to this date they were funded by a grant from the government's [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]]. The World Service cost the BBC £268 million in the 2017/18 financial year.<ref name="Financial Statements"/>

The BBC also paid in 2017/18 contributions to: broadband rollout (£80 million); partial funding of the Welsh channel (£74.8 million), [[S4C]] (which is also funded by the [[Department of Culture, Media and Sport]]); and a contribution towards the costs of local TV (£4.7 million).<ref name="Financial Statements"/>

[[BBC World News]] and the BBC's other international television channels are operated commercially and will continue to not receive licence fee money. The revenues they generate supplement the licence fee in financing the UK services.

In addition, the [[BBC Alba]] [[Scottish Gaelic|Gaelic language]] television service is predominantly funded by [[MG Alba]], an organisation funded by the [[Scottish Government]].

(*) During 2007/2008, the BBC stated that 3.6% of the licence fee was spent on collection.<ref name= "bbctrust2009" />

== TV licence legal requirements==

===When a TV licence is required===
According to section 363 of the [[Communications Act 2003]], a TV licence must be obtained for any device that is "installed or used"<ref>{{cite web|title=Communications Act 2003, Section 363(1)|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2003/21/section/363|publisher=The National Archives|access-date=28 February 2018}}</ref> for "receiving a television programme at the same time (or virtually the same time) as it is received by members of the public".<ref name="commregs">{{cite web|title=The Communications (Television Licensing) Regulations 2004, Regulation 9|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2004/692/regulation/9/made|publisher=The National Archives|access-date=28 February 2018}}</ref>

According to TV Licensing, "You need a TV Licence to use any television receiving equipment such as a TV set, digital box, DVD or video recorder, PC, laptop or mobile phone to watch or record television programmes as they're being shown on TV".<ref name="TVLInterpretation">{{cite web|author=TV Licensing|title=Do I need a TV Licence?|url=http://www.tvlicensing.co.uk/information/index.jsp#link1|access-date=3 August 2008}}</ref> Portable televisions and similar equipment such as laptops and mobile phones powered by internal batteries are covered for use anywhere under a licence held for their owner's residence.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/8285474.stm | work=BBC News | title=Firms issued TV licence warning | date=1 October 2009 | access-date=25 May 2010 | first=Harriet | last=Oliver}}</ref>

On 1 September 2016 the conditions under which a television licence is required changed to include receiving [[video on demand]] programme services provided by the BBC,<ref>[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2016/704/made The Communications (Television Licensing) (Amendment) Regulations 2016], S.I. 2016 No. 704, Reguluation 9: Modification of the Communications Act 2003</ref> on the [[iPlayer]] catch-up service.<ref name="iPlayer">{{cite web|url=http://www.tvlicensing.co.uk/check-if-you-need-one/topics/bbc-iplayer-and-the-tv-licence|title=Official TV Licensing website - BBC iPlayer and the TV Licence|website=www.tvlicensing.co.uk}}</ref>

However, there are a few [[Television licensing in the United Kingdom#Exceptions to the TV licensing regime|exceptional cases]] when live TV may be watched without a licence.

* listening to BBC radio programmes over the internet via [[BBC Sounds]].

A (free) licence is required for non-exempt premises even when no fee is payable, e.g. premises with residents over 75.

A recorded programme watched on unlicensed equipment is outside the scope of the Communications (Television Licensing) Regulations 2004, because it is not "received at the same time (or virtually the same time) as it is received by members of the public,"<ref name="commregs" /><ref name="BBCMobilePhones" /> although such recordings may infringe [[copyright]].

TV Licensing offers the following advice to those who have a TV but 'who wish to make it clear that they do not need a licence':<ref name="TV checks">{{cite web|url= http://www.parliament.uk/briefing-papers/SN01148.pdf|title=Television Licence Checks|publisher=House of Commons Library|access-date=2 September 2013}}</ref> 
* remove the television from the aerial;
* cover the aerial socket so that it can't be used;
* ensure that when channels on the television are selected no television signal is received.
However, TV Licensing also says that it is not compulsory to follow this advice. To listen to digital radio on a TV, for example, it would be necessary to attach the TV to an aerial and tune the TV to different channels. The BBC has made it clear that it is legal to listen to digital radio using a TV without holding a TV licence.<ref name="TVLExclusion3"/>

According to [[Ofcom]], TV transmissions over the Internet are a grey area<ref>{{cite web|author=The Digital TV Group|date=28 February 2005|title=BBC 'to lose in internet TV loophole'|url=http://dtg.org.uk/news/news.html?class=countries&subclass=193&id=695|access-date=18 June 2006}}{{dead link|date=July 2020|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> which in future might make fees based on television possession redundant. In 2005, a Green Paper by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport<ref name="review2005" /> included suggestions of "either a compulsory levy on all households or even on ownership of PCs as well as TVs".<ref>{{cite news|author=The Times|date=5 March 2005|title=Computer tax set to replace TV licence fee|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2-1508650,00.html|access-date=18 June 2006 | location=London}}</ref> However, TV Licensing later stated that use of any device (including a computer or mobile phone) receiving transmissions at or about the same time as they appear on TV requires a licence.<ref name="TVLInterpretation" /><ref name="BBCMobilePhones">{{cite news|author=BBC News|date=13 February 2006|title=Fine warning over TV on mobiles|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/4708170.stm|access-date=18 June 2006}}</ref> The BBC is aware that new technology represents a threat to its revenue.

Televisions receiving a transmission from outside the UK (e.g. broadcast from Germany, Italy, Greece, Turkey and the Netherlands via the [[Astra 1A|Astra satellite]], on which many channels are [[free-to-air]]) did not need a licence<ref name="Visiting proc"/> until the Communications Act 2003, which required a TV licence for the reception of television from any source.

===Exceptions to the TV licensing regime===

There are a few exceptions to the TV licensing regime where live TV may be watched without a TV licence being held for that property. These cases are:

* Crown immunity. According to the BBC: "neither the Communications Act 2003 nor the Communications (Television Licensing) Regulations 2004 bind the Crown. Thus, the Crown is not subject to the TV Licensing regime."<ref name="Crown Immunity">{{cite web|url=https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/exemptions_tv_licence#incoming-654950|title=Exemptions - TV Licence|publisher=Whatdotheyknow.com |access-date=1 June 2015}}</ref> Prison authorities can assert Crown immunity to allow prisoners to watch TV without a TV licence.<ref name="HMP">{{cite web|url=https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/tv_licence_in_prisons#incoming-654468|title=TV Licence in Prisons|publisher=Whatdotheyknow.com |access-date=3 June 2015}}</ref> In 2012, the BBC recognized that the UK Parliament is exempt from the TV licensing regime, and so the Parliamentary Estate stopped purchasing TV licences from this date.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.parliament.uk/site-information/foi/foi-and-eir/commons-foi-disclosures/estates-information/tv-licenses/|title=TV Licenses (2014)|website=UK Parliament|language=en|access-date=2019-05-20}}</ref>
* Events of national importance. The BBC can grant a dispensation for the temporary use of TV sets away from the licensed address in what it calls 'exceptional circumstances'. One example of this was the screening of the Queen's Diamond Jubilee celebrations in 2012. There are well defined criteria for when this exception is valid.<ref name ="Nat importance">{{cite web|url=https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/copy_of_ask_help_script#incoming-571034|title=Copy of Ask Help script|publisher=Whatdotheyknow.com |page=766|access-date=1 June 2015}}</ref>
* Foreign ships.

===Number of licences required per address===
A licence is required to watch live TV transmissions anywhere, including residential and business premises.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/5081350.stm |title=Q&A: The TV licence and your PC |access-date=20 July 2008 |work=BBC Web Site |publisher=BBC |date=15 June 2006 }}</ref>

For residential premises, only one licence is required per household per address, regardless of the number of licensed devices or the number of members of the household.<ref>[http://www.tvlicensing.co.uk/faqs/FAQ108/ Do I need a TV Licence for every TV in my household?], TV Licensing, 2011</ref> However, the licence itself is always held in the name of an individual.<ref name= "FS50165472">{{cite web |url=http://www.ico.org.uk/~/media/documents/decisionnotices/2009/FS_50165472.ashx |title=Freedom of Information Act 2000 (Section 50) Decision Notice |access-date=20 November 2013  |publisher=ICO |date=31 March 2009 }}</ref>

A rented property in multiple occupation by a joint [[tenancy]] agreement is considered by TV Licensing as one household and requires only one licence, but a rented property with multiple, separate tenancy agreements is not considered a single household and each tenant may require a separate licence.<ref>[http://www.tvlicensing.co.uk/faqs/FAQ35/ Do I need a licence if I live in a shared house and it's not my TV?], TV Licensing, 2011</ref> For example, a [[house in multiple occupation]] may have private bedrooms and shared communal areas: if five occupants share such a property with individual tenancy agreements then they may require up to five television licences if each private room contains a television receiver, while a similar property housing five occupants under a joint tenancy agreement may require only one television licence.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvlicensing.co.uk/check-if-you-need-one/for-your-home/students-aud1/#Box1 |title=Students |publisher=TV Licensing |date=27 August 2009 |access-date=12 July 2011}}</ref>

===Television use away from home===
Use of television in a [[mobile home|static caravan]] is covered by the licence held for the user's main address, provided there is no simultaneous use of television at both places, and the use of television in a [[travel trailer|touring caravan]] is always covered by the user's main home licence.<ref name="TVLABOUT">{{cite web |url=http://www.tvlicensing.co.uk/pdfs/40115_BBC_Freedom_of_Info.pdf |title=TV Licensing, "About TV Licensing" |publisher=Tvlicensing.co.uk |access-date=12 July 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718225033/http://www.tvlicensing.co.uk/pdfs/40115_BBC_Freedom_of_Info.pdf |archive-date=18 July 2011 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The use of a television set which is powered solely by its own internal batteries is covered for any address by the user's main home licence, but requires a separate licence if it is plugged into the mains or other external power source, such as a car battery;<ref name="TVLABOUT" /> this also applies to TV-enabled mobile telephones.<ref name="BBCMobilePhones" />

Students during term-time may not need a separate TV licence if one is held at their permanent home-address if they watch TV on a device powered solely by its own internal batteries.  Specifically, in order to be able to watch TV without a licence at their term-time address, the following must be true:<ref name="students">{{cite web|url=http://www.tvlicensing.co.uk/check-if-you-need-one/for-your-home/students-aud1|title=Students |publisher=TV Licensing |access-date=3 February 2015}}</ref>

* The out-of-term address must be covered by a TV licence
* Any TV receiving equipment used must be powered solely by its own internal batteries
* The TV equipment must not be connected to an aerial or plugged into the mains.

People living exclusively in a mobile dwelling such as a touring caravan or a constantly cruising canal boat, who do not have a static address, are not legally able to watch a television as they cannot purchase a licence without such an address.

==Licence fee enforcement==

===TV licence evaders===
A person who watches or records live TV without being in possession of a TV licence is referred to by the BBC as a 'TV licence evader'.<ref name="Trust statement 2013"/> Each year the BBC estimates the evasion rate (expressed as a percentage of total 'licensable properties') and publishes the value in its Annual Report and Accounts.

The basic formula for estimating the evasion rate is:<ref name="Trust report 2011"/>

::<math>1-\frac{L}{{{(Ho)}{(PR)}+{NDL}}}</math> &nbsp;&nbsp;
where:

''{{serif|L}}'': number of TV Licences in force

''{{serif|Ho}}'': number of domestic households

''{{serif|PR}}'': penetration rate of TVs into households

''{{serif|NDL}}'': non-domestic licences required

The figure for the number of licences in force is taken from the [[television licensing in the United Kingdom#LASSY database|BBC's database]]. The other variables used to calculate the evasion rates are estimates. The data for the number of domestic households is taken from the [[Department of Communities and Local Government]] figures. The [[Broadcasters' Audience Research Board]] survey is used to estimate the rate of penetration of TV sets into domestic households. Non-domestic licences include licences required for students, military accommodation, hotels and businesses. Various sources are used to estimate this figure.<ref name="Trust statement 2013"/>

The most recent published figures for 2018/19 state that the evasion rate is between 6 and 7%.<ref name="TVL Annual Report 2018/19">{{cite web|title=TV Licensing Annual Review 2018/19|url=https://www.tvlicensing.co.uk/ss/Satellite?blobcol=urldata&blobheadername1=content-type&blobheadervalue1=application%2Fpdf&blobkey=id&blobtable=MungoBlobs&blobwhere=1370006520458&ssbinary=true|website=www.tvlicensing.co.uk|publisher=TV Licensing|access-date=5 April 2020}}</ref> For the year 2005–6, TV Licensing reported that they "reduced estimated evasion to a record low of 4.7%".<ref name="TVL2005/6">{{cite web |url=http://www.tvlicensing.co.uk/pdfs/AnnualReview_en2006.pdf?r_exit_link=d_pdf_download |title=TV Licensing Annual Review, 2005/6 |publisher=Tvlicensing.co.uk |access-date=12 July 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718224946/http://www.tvlicensing.co.uk/pdfs/AnnualReview_en2006.pdf?r_exit_link=d_pdf_download |archive-date=18 July 2011 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> However, this figure rose during the following year to 5.1%<ref name="TVL2006/7" /> and remained at 5.1% during 2007–8.<ref name="BBCTrustReview" /> For the year 2010/2011 the evasion rate is stated as 5.2%.<ref name="TVL2010/11">{{cite web|url=http://www.tvlicensing.co.uk/resources/library/BBC/OUR_PERFORMANCE/TVL_Annual_Review_Eng_2011.pdf|title=2010/11 Annual Review|publisher=www.tvlicensing.co.uk|access-date=12 July 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130722155857/http://www.tvlicensing.co.uk/resources/library/BBC/OUR_PERFORMANCE/TVL_Annual_Review_Eng_2011.pdf|archive-date=22 July 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref> According to the BBC "the published rate of evasion has increased marginally to 5.5% in 2012/13".<ref name="Trust statement 2013" /> The evasion rate is far from uniform across the UK, with Scotland having a far higher rate than the UK as a whole.<ref name="Scotland evasion">{{cite news|url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/revealed-britains-capital-for-tv-licence-1032982 |title=Revealed: Britain's capital for TV licence fee evasion is.. Glasgow |newspaper=Daily Record  |access-date=7 November 2012}}</ref>
One reason given by the BBC for evasion is lack of money in a household. For example, in the BBC Full Financial Statement 2012/13 the BBC says: 'as household budgets come under pressure, we are starting to see an increase in licence fee evasion
rates over their prior year level'.<ref name="Financial Statements2013">{{cite web|url=http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/annualreport/pdf/2012-13/bbc-full-financial-statements-2012-13.pdf|title=BBC Full Financial Statements 2012/13|publisher=BBC|access-date= 23 July 2014}}</ref> However, this is not the only reason given for TV licence evasion, since according to a submission made by the BBC to the Information Commissioner's Office: 'the BBC said that it is also aware that a growing number of individuals deliberately evade the licence fee due to dissatisfaction with the BBC'.<ref name= "ICO">{{cite web|url=http://www.ico.org.uk/~/media/documents/decisionnotices/2008/FS_50154106.ashx |title=Freedom of Information Act 2000 (Section 50) Decision Notice |publisher=Information Commissioner's Office|access-date=29 July 2013}}</ref>

According to a [[National Audit Office (United Kingdom)|National Audit Office]] report from 2002: "Areas with high evasion rates are most likely to have, for example, a higher than average proportion of younger people, low income households, and students and single parent families, and a level of [[County Court (England and Wales)|County Court]] judgments 50 per cent above the national average".<ref name = "NAO"/> However, according to the BBC, 'evasion is spread across all socioeconomic groups'.<ref name="TVL2006/7"/> The BBC has also claimed that the 'TV Licensing evader profile' could be characterised by the distribution by [[social grade]] of 1.3m properties that were not licensed on 31 March 2007. The profile was given as follows: AB 20.1%, C1 29.1%, C2 13.6%, D 18.9%, E 18.3%.<ref name="TVL2006/7"/>

The [[Broadcasters' Audience Research Board]] estimated that of June 2004, 2.3% of UK households do not have television,<ref name="BBC16FEB2006">[https://www.bbc.co.uk/foi/docs/freedom_of_information/selected_requests_and_responses/2006/SR2006000097_Population_without_Television.pdf BBC response to Freedom of Information Request, 16/02/2006]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080528025124/http://www.bbc.co.uk/foi/docs/freedom_of_information/selected_requests_and_responses/2006/SR2006000097_Population_without_Television.pdf |date=28 May 2008 }}</ref> and in September 2008, the BBC reported that some one million people do not need a TV licence.<ref name="BBCTrustReview" /> Alleged excuses given by householders for not having a licence include loss of mail, being "too busy" and suffering from [[polymorphous light eruption]] (sun allergy).<ref name="bbc licence excuses">{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-14975564 | title=TV licence excuses include postman affairs and sunlight | work=[[BBC News]] | date=20 September 2011 | access-date=20 September 2011 | quote=The top ten excuses as defined by TV Licensing were: "Since I had a bit of a fling with the postman I haven't been receiving my mail so I didn't get my TV Licence reminder"; [...] "I never got the reminders because my two-year-old hides all my post in her toy box"; [...] "I'm getting married and am too busy picking flowers, colours and things to buy a TV Licence."; "I cannot go out to buy a licence because I am allergic to the sun."}}</ref> The results of market research carried out on self-identified evaders concluded that roughly half were 'opportunistic delayers' who were [[gaming the system|playing the system]] to avoid immediate payment and that the others were 'deliberate evaders' who were trying to 'cheat the system'. Nearly one fifth of respondents claimed never to have bought a TV licence.<ref name = "NAO"/>

===LASSY database===
Since it is not possible to prevent a person buying and using TV receiving equipment without being in possession of a licence, the TV licence system is enforced by first identifying TV licence evaders and then attempting to sell them a licence and, in some cases, prosecuting them.<ref name="Visiting proc"/> The critical method of detecting TV licence evaders is through the use of a database system known as ''LASSY'',<ref name="NatAud2002">{{cite web|author=National Audit Office|date=15 May 2002|title=The BBC: Collecting the television licence fee|url=http://www.nao.org.uk/publications/0102/the_bbc_collecting_the_televi.aspx|access-date=18 June 2006}}</ref> which contains 29.5 million<ref name="TVL2006/7">{{cite web|url=http://www.tvlicensing.co.uk/ss/Satellite?blobcol=urldata&blobheadername1=content-type&blobheadervalue1=application%2Fpdf&blobkey=id&blobtable=MungoBlobs&blobwhere=1370006225058&ssbinary=true|title=TV Licensing Annual Review, 2006/7 |publisher=Tvlicensing.co.uk |access-date=12 July 2011}}</ref> addresses in the UK. LASSY is an acronym of 'Licence Administration and Support System'.<ref name= "bbctrust2009" /> According to the National Audit Office: "The database holds records of potentially licensable properties and basic details (such as the name of the licence holder and the licence expiry date) of those for which valid licences are held".<ref name = "NAO"/> This database is routinely updated with licence holders' details. Until 25 June 2013, dealers in television receiving equipment were required by law to provide TV Licensing with identifying information about everyone who buys or rents such equipment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvlicensing.co.uk/check-if-you-need-one/business-and-organisations/tv-dealers-aud18/?WT.mc_id=r033|title=Official TV Licensing website - TV dealers|website=www.tvlicensing.co.uk}}</ref> However this requirement has been lifted by the [[Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Act 2013]].<ref name="Enterprise Bill">{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/bills/cbill/2012-2013/0007/en/13007en.pdf|title=Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Bill  |publisher=UK Parliament|access-date=4 July 2013}}</ref> TV Licensing maintains permanent contact with every address in the database that is recorded as not having a TV licence<ref name="BBC04AUG2006">[https://www.bbc.co.uk/foi/docs/freedom_of_information/selected_requests_and_responses/2006/SR2006000443_Cost_of_TV_Licence_Notice_Letters.pdf BBC response to Freedom of Information Request, 04/08/2006]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080528025143/http://www.bbc.co.uk/foi/docs/freedom_of_information/selected_requests_and_responses/2006/SR2006000443_Cost_of_TV_Licence_Notice_Letters.pdf |date=28 May 2008 }}</ref> until a licence is purchased for that address or until TV Licensing confirm that the household does not need a licence. If it is confirmed that a household does not watch or record live TV, the address is put into the NLCC (No Licence Needed Claim Confirmed) category. Residential properties put into this category are not visited or contacted for a period of two years from the time that the claim was confirmed. Business properties on the other hand, are exempted from visits or mailings for three years after confirmation.<ref name="Visiting proc" />

===TV Licensing letters and telephone calls===
TV Licensing may make initial contact by letter<ref name ="TVL letters">{{cite web|url=https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/wording_and_approval_of_tv_licen#incoming-247162|title=Wording and Approval of TV Licensing Letters
|publisher=Whatdotheyknow.com |access-date=16 January 2014}}</ref> or by phone with occupants of addresses for which there is no current licence.<ref name= "bbctrust2009" /> During the financial year 2012–13, approximately 21.5 million letters were sent to unlicensed addresses. The average postage cost to post one standard TV Licensing letter in the financial year 2012/13 was stated to be £0.2059.<ref name="TVL letters number">{{cite web|url=https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/letters_sent_out#incoming-476482|title=Letters sent out|publisher=Whatdotheyknow.com |access-date=18 November 2014}}</ref> The methods by which an occupant can reply are in writing, by telephone or by filling in an online form. If there is no reply to the first letter and a TV licence is not bought by the occupant, then TV Licensing continues to write regularly to the address and "the tone of the letters progressively becomes stronger to encourage a reply".<ref name="TVLExclusion3" /> For example, one of its standard letters includes the phrase: "Official warning: We have opened an investigation". This warning was included in 940,615 letters sent in January/February 2013.<ref name ="warning letters">{{cite web|url=https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/the_bbcs_use_of_the_term_investi#incoming-377031|title=The BBC's use of the term "Investigation"

Three basic tones of voice are used in TV Licensing letters: "Customer Service", "Collections" and "Enforcement".<ref name ="TVL letters"/> According to the BBC: "Customer service is the brand experience we create for customers who are currently licensed, unknowingly unlicensed or who don’t need a licence", whereas "Collections is the brand experience we create for those customers whose TV licence has expired and whom TV Licensing wants to motivate to renew." Finally, the enforcement tone is used for households who have been unlicensed for a longer period. This period is not specified in freely available documents but TV Licensing suggests it could be used, for example, for the third and fourth renewal reminder.<ref name ="TVL letters"/> Each of these 'tones' involves letters with a different colour palette. For example, green is used in 'Customer Service' letters and red may be used in 'Collections' and 'Enforcement' letters. In all cases, the vocabulary and format used in the letters is strictly defined.<ref name ="TVL letters"/>

If a business or household is not obliged to have a TV licence then TV Licensing will request written confirmation of this, even though no such information is required to be given in law.<ref name="BBC08FEB2006">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/foi/docs/freedom_of_information/selected_requests_and_responses/2007/SR2007000351_Search_Warrant_Procedure.pdf|title=Internet Archive: Scheduled Maintenance|date=13 April 2008|url-status=bot: unknown|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080413163408/http://www.bbc.co.uk/foi/docs/freedom_of_information/selected_requests_and_responses/2007/SR2007000351_Search_Warrant_Procedure.pdf|archive-date=13 April 2008|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>Confirmed by [[Shaun Woodward]] (Parliamentary Under-Secretary, Department for Culture, Media and Sport) in response to a request for clarification from a constituent [https://www.theyworkforyou.com/wrans/?id=2006-05-15b.69812.h#g69812.r0]</ref>

According to the BBC, it is not possible to opt out of receiving TVL mailings since they 'are not advertising or marketing material'.<ref name ="Ask script opt out">{{cite web|url=https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/copy_of_ask_help_script#incoming-571034|title=Copy of Ask Help script|publisher=Whatdotheyknow.com |page=246|access-date=8 April 2015}}</ref> Similarly, householders who do not have a licence cannot exclude themselves from unsolicited calls from TV Licensing by registering with the [[Telephone Preference Service]].<ref name ="Ask script opt out tel">{{cite web|url=https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/copy_of_ask_help_script#incoming-571034|title=Copy of Ask Help script|publisher=Whatdotheyknow.com |page=320|access-date=10 April 2015}}</ref>

In 2014, a householder invoiced TV Licensing £40 as a 'processing fee' for 'opening, reading and filing' a TV Licensing letter. Because TV Licensing did not pay the charge, the householder took the claim to the County Court, eventually winning the case and receiving the fee plus other costs incurred.<ref name ="TVL sued">{{cite web|url=http://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/tv_licensing_successfully_sued|title=TV Licensing successfully sued

=== Enquiry officer visits===
If a colour TV licence is not purchased for an address, TV Licensing agents—known as "visiting officers", "enquiry officers" or "enforcement officers"—make unannounced visits to the address. In August 2013, there were reported to be 334 enquiry officers<ref name="radiotimes">{{cite magazine|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2013-09-27/do-tv-detector-vans-exist-leaked-document-suggests-they-could-be-a-ruse|title=Do TV Detector Vans Exist?|magazine=Radio Times|access-date=31 October 2013}}</ref> all employees of the BBC's main enforcement contractor, Capita. Enquiry officers make around four million visits a year to households in the UK and Crown dependencies.{{cn|date=December 2019}} Each week an enquiry officer may upload a number of unlicensed addresses onto their "handheld device".<ref name="VO - the role">{{cite web|title=The Role|url=http://visitingofficers.co.uk/the-role/|website=http://visitingofficers.co.uk/|publisher=Capita|access-date=20 October 2015}}</ref> The enquiry officer is only allowed to visit the addresses on this list, which are normally within a thirty-minute travelling distance from their home postcode. Enquiry officers do not visit addresses in their own postcode, however.<ref name="VO - the role"/>

Although TV Licensing enforces the BBC's statutory obligation to ensure that every address where a television licence is required is correctly licensed, its agents have no special right of access and, like any other member of the public, rely on an implied right of access to reach the front door. A householder may withdraw the implied right of access to TV Licensing personnel by contacting the BBC and informing them that this right has been revoked; the BBC says they respect such requests (although could still seek a warrant to search the property), except in Scotland.<ref name="WOIRA Scotland">{{cite web|title=Policy Change for Scottish Residents regarding access withdrawal|url=https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/policy_change_for_scottish_resid#incoming-651942|website=WhatDoTheyKnow|publisher=WhatDoTheyKnow|access-date=18 August 2015}}</ref> As of March 2014, 7299 households had withdrawn the implied right of access.{{cn|date=December 2019}} This figure had increased to over 20,000 by December 2015.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/implied_right#incoming-759168|title=Implied Right - a Freedom of Information request to British Broadcasting Corporation|date=2015-12-27|newspaper=WhatDoTheyKnow|access-date=2016-12-12}}</ref>

Upon visiting a property, enquiry officers ask a set of predetermined questions to whoever answers the door when they visit."<ref name="Visiting proc">{{cite web|url=https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/information_about_tv_licensing_i#incoming-498625|title=Information about TV Licensing induction and training|publisher=Whatdotheyknow.com|access-date=6 May 2015}}</ref> They first try to find out if the person who responds to the enquiry officer is an "appropriate person" to interview (i.e. an adult who lives at the property). They then try to find out if that person has been receiving TV without a licence. If they suspect that this is the case, they issue an official caution to the person that whatever they say may be used against them in court. They then take a prosecution statement and ask the interviewee to sign it. The enquiry officer may ask permission to enter the property and may examine any TV receiving equipment found there. According to the visiting procedures: 'circumstantial evidence of use should be noted on the Record of Interview whenever visible (e.g. sky dish, aerial lead plugged into TV, remote control on settee) as this provides supporting evidence for potential prosecution and may be vital if the confession should later be challenged.'<ref name="Visiting proc" />. However, the occupant is well within his/her rights to deny answering any questions (remain silent) and  is under no obligation to allow entry into the property.

If an agent has evidence that television is being watched or recorded illegally but is denied entry by the occupants so that they cannot verify the suspicion, then TV Licensing may apply to a [[magistrate]] for a [[search warrant]].<ref name="TVL2006/7" /> The BBC states that a search warrant would never be applied for solely on the basis of non-cooperation with TV Licensing<ref name="BBC25AUG2006">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/foi/docs/freedom_of_information/selected_requests_and_responses/2006/SR2006000476_TV_Licence_Search_Warrants.pdf|title=Internet Archive: Scheduled Maintenance|date=13 April 2008|url-status=bot: unknown|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080413163405/http://www.bbc.co.uk/foi/docs/freedom_of_information/selected_requests_and_responses/2006/SR2006000476_TV_Licence_Search_Warrants.pdf|archive-date=13 April 2008|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name="BBC13APR2007">[https://www.bbc.co.uk/foi/docs/freedom_of_information/selected_requests_and_responses/2007/SR2007000351_Search_Warrant_Procedure.pdf BBC response to Freedom of Information Request, 13/04/2007]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080528025108/http://www.bbc.co.uk/foi/docs/freedom_of_information/selected_requests_and_responses/2007/SR2007000351_Search_Warrant_Procedure.pdf |date=28 May 2008 }}</ref> and that in the event of being denied access to unlicensed property will use detection equipment rather than a search warrant.<ref name="BBC18SEP2007">[https://www.bbc.co.uk/foi/docs/freedom_of_information/selected_requests_and_responses/2007/SR2007000748_Legislation_for_TV_licence.pdf BBC response to Freedom of Information Request, 18/09/2007]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080528025110/http://www.bbc.co.uk/foi/docs/freedom_of_information/selected_requests_and_responses/2007/SR2007000748_Legislation_for_TV_licence.pdf |date=28 May 2008 }}</ref>

===Detection technology===

====TV detector vans====
[[File:BLW TV Detector Van.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Leyland Sherpa]] television detector van]]

[[TV detector van]]s have in the past featured heavily in TV Licensing publicity,<ref name="colombo">{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/films/1964to1979/filmpage_tv.htm |title=TV Licence – Columbo |publisher=The National Archives |access-date=27 September 2012}}</ref> highlighting that technology capable of detecting signals from operating TV sets could be employed.<ref name="press release 2003">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2003/06_june/24/licensing_detector_vans.shtml |title=Press Office – New generation of television detector vans |publisher=BBC |access-date=12 July 2011}}</ref> Detector vans date from the 1950s, when the Post Office van converted [[Hillman Minx]] and [[Morris Oxford MO|Morris Oxford]] estate cars, which had large aerials attached to their roofs.{{cn|date=December 2019}} Subsequently [[Commer]]s were introduced. In the 1980s, vans were supplied by [[Dodge]] and [[British Leyland|Leyland]]. In the 1990s, [[Ford Transit]]s were introduced. In 2003, TVL launched its tenth generation of detector vans. It was stated that these vans had removable branding so that they could operate covertly.<ref name="new generation">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2003/06_june/24/licensing_detector_vans.shtml|title=New generation of television detector vans hit the streets|publisher=BBC|access-date=3 June 2014}}</ref>
[[File:Dodge detector van.JPG|thumb|right|A [[Dodge]] television detector van]]
Few technical details of the detectors used have been released. In a press release from 2003, the BBC stated that:<ref name="press release 2003"/> "the new vans are so powerful they can tell if a TV is in use in as little as 20 seconds". It was also stated that the equipment has a range of up to 60 metres and "can pinpoint the actual room that the television set is in." However, on TV Licensing's own site in 2015, no information on range or accuracy of the equipment is given. It says that "a range of detection tools at our disposal in our vans". It is also stated that the available equipment has been developed in secrecy and that "engineers working on specific detection methods work in isolation – so not even they know how the other detection methods work."<ref name= "How do they work">{{cite web|url=http://www.tvlicensing.co.uk/faqs/FAQ73/|title=How do the detector vans work? |publisher=TV Licensing|access-date=21 October 2013}}</ref>

Although no technical details of the TV detectors used in these vans have been made public, it is thought that they operate by detecting electromagnetic radiation given off by a TV.<ref name="New Scientist TV Detectors">{{cite magazine|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg14719887.500-deceptor-vans.html|title=Deceptor vans|magazine=New Scientist|access-date=19 May 2014}}</ref> The most common suggested method is the detection of a signal from the TV's [[local oscillator]].<ref name="US patent - local oscillator">{{cite web|last1=Douglass|first1=Ralph G.|title=Tuned signal detector for use with a radio frequency receiver - US Patent 5,404,161|url=http://www.patents.com/us-5404161.html|website=http://www.patents.com|publisher=www.patents.com|access-date=17 November 2015}}</ref>

It has been suggested in the media that TV detector vans do not actually exist. An 2013 article in the ''[[Radio Times]]'' reported that a leaked BBC document on the collection of the licence fee "makes no mention of detector vans – but it does contain plenty of other facts and figures".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2013-09-27/do-tv-detector-vans-exist-leaked-document-suggests-they-could-be-a-ruse|title=Do TV detector vans exist?

====Hand-held detectors====
Hand-held TV detectors have also been developed by the BBC.<ref name="TVL2006/7" /> In the ''Birmingham Mail'' for the same year, the detectors were described as 'little bigger than a torch', weighing 280g (10oz), which made a beeping noise when they detect a TV.<ref name= "handheld">{{cite web|url=http://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/local-news/new-weapon-to-catch-tv-licence-43362|title=New weapon to catch TV licence cheats|publisher=www.birminghammail.co.uk|date= 1 August 2007|access-date= 9 January 2015}}</ref>

====Optical detectors====
In 2013 it was revealed that the BBC had used optical TV detectors to apply for a search warrant. Although few technical details were given, it was stated in an application for a search warrant that: "the optical detector in the detector van uses a large lens to collect that light and focus it on to an especially sensitive device, which converts fluctuating light signals into electrical signals, which can be electronically analysed. If a receiver is being used to watch broadcast programmes then a positive reading is returned."

The BBC states that such technology used in conjunction with targeted advertising acts as a [[deterrence (psychological)|deterrent]]: its use may make it easier for TV Licensing agents to establish that an offence is likely to be taking place but they would still need to secure further evidence for successful prosecution.<ref name="NatAud2002"/><ref name="BBC14MAR2007" /> Furthermore, such technology is restricted in its use by the meaning of "surveillance and covert human intelligence sources" in the [[Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000]]<ref name="TVL2006/7" /> and the Regulation of Investigatory Powers (British Broadcasting Corporation) Order 2001.<ref name="BBC08AUG2006">[https://www.bbc.co.uk/foi/docs/freedom_of_information/selected_requests_and_responses/2006/SR2006000444_Number_of_Licence-Fee_Evaders.pdf BBC response to Freedom of Information Request, 08/08/2006]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080413163411/http://www.bbc.co.uk/foi/docs/freedom_of_information/selected_requests_and_responses/2006/SR2006000444_Number_of_Licence-Fee_Evaders.pdf |date=13 April 2008 }}</ref><ref name="Statute2001/1057">{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si2001/20011057.htm |title=Home Office – The Regulation of Investigatory Powers (British Broadcasting Corporation) Order 2001 |publisher=Opsi.gov.uk |date=4 July 2011 |access-date=12 July 2011}}</ref> 
Like other public bodies that undertake covert surveillance, the BBC is subject to the scrutiny of the Office of Surveillance Commissioners, which inspects the BBC every other year.<ref name="OSC">{{cite web|url=https://osc.independent.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/OSC-Annual-Report-2012-13.pdf|title=Annual Report of the Chief Surveillance Commissioner|publisher=The Stationery Office|access-date=30 September 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160115105034/https://osc.independent.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/OSC-Annual-Report-2012-13.pdf|archive-date=15 January 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> A number of official inspection reports on the BBC's detection methods have been made available following freedom of information requests<ref name="OSC inspection">{{cite web|url=https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/office_of_the_surveillance_commi#incoming-436439|title=Office of the Surveillance Commissioner's Report, 2008 |publisher=Whatdotheyknow.com |access-date=12 January 2014}}</ref> These reports give an outline of the process of authorisation of the use of detection equipment. Briefly, applications for authorisation are made in the name of the Detection Manager of Capita. Correspondence between TV Licensing and the affected householder may be attached to the completed application forms which pass via a quality control 'gatekeeper' to the authorising officers (AOs) at the BBC. In 2012 there were two designated AOs at the BBC. To be authorised, an application must be shown to be 'necessary and proportionate'. AOs sometimes reject applications. Once approved, the authorisation lasts for a duration of eight weeks.

TV Licensing states "detection equipment will only be used if other less intrusive and more cost effective routes have been exhausted",<ref name="TVL Our Roles">{{cite web |url=http://www.tvlicensing.co.uk/about/our-roles-and-responsibilities-AB3|title=Our roles and responsibilities|access-date=30 October 2014 |publisher=TV Licensing}}</ref> and the BBC has stated that "Detection technology is generally used to obtain search warrants".<ref name="BBC14MAR2007">[https://www.bbc.co.uk/foi/docs/freedom_of_information/selected_requests_and_responses/2007/SR2007000205_Detection_of_TV_Usage.pdf BBC response to Freedom of Information Request, 14/03/2007]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080528025115/http://www.bbc.co.uk/foi/docs/freedom_of_information/selected_requests_and_responses/2007/SR2007000205_Detection_of_TV_Usage.pdf |date=28 May 2008 }}</ref> 
In a reply to a FOI request in 2011, the BBC stated "I can confirm that TVL has not, to date, used detection evidence in Court". The BBC also wrote that such evidence "is unnecessary" because "TVL uses detection evidence when applying for search warrants. If, following service of the warrant an individual is found to be evading payment of the TV Licence, then the evidence obtained via the search warrant is used in court, not the detection evidence.<ref name="evidence in court">{{cite web|url=https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/evidence_from_tv_detection_equip#outgoing-109179|title=Evidence from TV Detection Equipment}}</ref>

===Search warrants===
In some cases, TV Licensing may apply to a magistrate (or a sheriff in Scotland) for a search warrant as part of the enforcement process.<ref name="FOI: Administering the TV Licensing system part 2">{{cite web |url=http://www.tvlicensing.co.uk/about/foi-administering-the-tv-licensing-system-part-2-AB20 |title=FOI: Administering the TV Licensing system part 2 |publisher=Tvlicensing.co.uk |access-date=14 August 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120730190145/http://www.tvlicensing.co.uk/about/foi-administering-the-tv-licensing-system-part-2-AB20/ |archive-date=30 July 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> According to TV Licensing such an application may only be made 'when there is good reason to believe that an offence has been committed, evidence of the commission of that offence is likely to be found, and conditions regarding access to the property warrant the granting of a search warrant'.<ref name="FOI: Administering the TV Licensing system part 2"/> The same source also states that 'The BBC contracts Capita Business Services Ltd to carry out television licensing enforcement activities, including applying for and executing search warrants.'  The BBC's contractor uses powers granted by Section 366 of the Communications Act 2003 to apply for and exercise search warrants.<ref name="section 366">{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2003/21/section/366|title=Communications Act 2003
|publisher=www.legislation.gov.uk|access-date=13 February 2014}}</ref> The Act specifies that the search warrant is valid for a month after being granted. According to the BBC, such warrants are usually executed in the presence of police officers.<ref name="FOI: Administering the TV Licensing system part 2"/> The TV Licensing Visiting Procedures state: 'To minimise the impact on normal operations Enforcement Managers accompanied by an EO should in normal circumstances execute search warrants. On no account must the warrant be executed without two officers being present. Normally the two officers must be accompanied by a Police Officer'.<ref name="Visiting proc"/> The warrant provides an authorisation to search a premises, and to examine and test any television receiver found. However, there is no power to seize any apparatus.<ref name="search warrant powers">{{cite web|url=https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/request_for_documents_and_clarif#incoming-498605|publisher=Whatdotheyknow.com |title= Request for documents and clarification of Visiting Procedures|access-date=28 March 2014}}</ref> According to the BBC Search Warrant Policy "force must not be used by TV Licensing to gain entry to a property".<ref name="Warrant Policy">{{cite web|url=https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/tv_licensing_search_warrant_info#incoming-524768|title=TV licensing Search warrant information

Data on the number of search warrants executed per year in the whole of the UK are not collated or held centrally by the various judicial bodies of the state. However, the BBC, itself, holds the information some of which has become available due to FOI requests.<ref name="Monthly Packs">{{cite web|title=Monthly Performance Pack|url=https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/monthly_performance_pack_2#comment-70446|website=www.whatdotheyknow.com|publisher=WhatDoTheyKnow|access-date=13 July 2016}}</ref> For example, in the financial year 2014/15, TV Licensing applied for 256 warrants to serve in the UK. 167 warrants were granted by the courts of which 115 were executed. In the same year in Scotland no warrants were applied for or served whilst in Northern Ireland 12 warrants were granted and 7 executed in the year.<ref name="Monthly Packs"/>

Some idea of the frequency at which warrants are used may also be taken from the result of a recent FOI request.<ref name="Sheffield warrants">{{cite web|url=https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/instances_of_evidence_submitted |title=Instances of evidence submitted for TVL to obtain search warrants |publisher=Whatdotheyknow.com |access-date=24 February 2014}}</ref> It was revealed that Sheffield Magistrates granted TV Licensing a total of six search warrants in the years 2011, 2012 and 2013, whilst in Northampton (including Wellingborough and Kettering) only two were granted in this period.

Information provided by the [[Scottish Court Service]] suggests that TV Licensing search warrant applications in Scotland are virtually non-existent. In their response to a FOI request the Scottish Court Service confirmed that no search warrant applications were made to courts in Scotland's two largest cities, [[Glasgow]] and [[Edinburgh]], in the three-and-a-half years between 1 January 2011 and 21 July 2014.<ref name="SCS29JULY14">{{cite web|url=https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/220893/response/544139/attach/2/FoI+Jones+summary+warrants+Jul14.pdf|title=TV Licensing Search Warrant Applications - a Freedom of Information request to Scottish Courts and Tribunals Service|date=21 July 2014}}</ref>

Licence evaders are liable for prosecution and a fine of up to £1,000 in the UK.<ref name="UKGOV">{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/tv-licence|title=TV Licence|publisher=www.gov.uk|access-date=20 February 2014}}</ref> However, because the licensing regime covers six different jurisdictions, the legal processes and penalties for the crime of TV licence evasion differ markedly across the UK and Crown dependencies.

TV licence evasion is not punishable by a period of imprisonment ''per se'', but if convicted evaders refuse to pay the fine they were ordered to pay, or are incapable of paying it, a period of imprisonment may be imposed as a "last resort". The length of stay is decided by the amount owed. In England and Wales, 5 people were given an average of 19 days in 2018<ref name ="DCMS Consultation 2020">{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/consultation-on-decriminalising-tv-licence-evasion/consultation-on-decriminalising-tv-licence-evasion|title=Consultation on decriminalising TV licence evasion|publisher=UK Government|access-date=5 April 2020}}</ref> (compared to 20 days in 2014, 32 in 2013 and 51 in 2012).<ref name="heraldscotland.com"/> There were no custodial sentences imposed during the five-year period 2009–10 to 2013–14 in Scotland or in Jersey.

The British Government proposed decriminalising licence evasion, but the proposition was turned down by a House of Lords vote by 178 to 175 in February 2015.<ref name=RTS>{{cite web|title=House of Lords blocks attempt to decriminalise licence fee non-payment|url=https://rts.org.uk/article/house-lords-blocks-attempt-decriminalise-licence-fee-non-payment|website=rts.org.uk|publisher=Royal Television Society|access-date=9 September 2015}}</ref> Behavioural research conducted for the BBC predicted that if TV licence evasion was decriminalised and the £1,000 maximum fine was replaced by a civil penalty of over £300, evasion rates would increase.

[[File:Pontefract Magistrates' Court.JPG|thumb|right|Pontefract Magistrates' Court. In England and Wales, cases involving TV licence evasion are held at magistrates' courts]]
In England and Wales, prosecutions are the responsibility of the BBC and are carried out by its contractor, Capita, in magistrates' courts<ref name ="TVL Briefing"/> In England and Wales TV Licensing has a maximum of 26 weeks to lay information to court after receiving information regarding unlicensed use of a TV from its enquiry officers.<ref name ="Prosecution flow">{{cite web|url=https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/tv_licensing_prosecution_time_li#incoming-533065|title=TV Licensing Prosecution Time Limits|publisher=whatdotheyknow.com |access-date=18 March 2015}}</ref> During this period, and a maximum of 24 hours before a decision to prosecute a householder is taken, TV Licensing will check if a licence has been purchased. The decision to prosecute usually takes place 12–14 weeks from receiving the enquiry officer's report. TV Licensing serves documents on defendants four to six weeks prior to a court hearing. A final check to see if a TV licence has been purchased is made a maximum of two days before the hearing.

Licence fee evasion makes up around one-tenth of all cases prosecuted in magistrates' courts<ref name="Full Fact Licence Fee">{{cite web|url=https://fullfact.org/news/do-tv-licence-offences-account-one-ten-court-cases/ |title=Do TV licence offences account for one in ten court cases |publisher=Full Fact |access-date=5 April 2020}}</ref> and 0.3% of court time.<ref name="Perry reference BBC">{{cite web| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2019-50800128 |title=BBC: TV licence fee decriminalisation being considered |publisher=bbc.co.uk |access-date=5 April 2020}}</ref> Proceedings for TV Licence evasion form a high percentage of all prosecutions carried out against women – over a third of all cases against women in England and Wales in 2013 were for this offence.<ref name ="Number of TV prosecutions">{{cite web|url=https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/numbers_of_prosecutions_for_tv_l#incoming-543026|title=Numbers of prosecutions for TV licensing issues|publisher=whatdotheyknow.com |access-date=29 July 2014}}</ref> By comparison, TV licence evasion made up around 5% of prosecutions against men in 2013 in England and Wales.<ref name ="Number of TV prosecutions"/>

The maximum [[fine (penalty)|fine]] for this offence of up to £1,000 is frequently publicised by TV Licensing to maximise deterrence.<ref name="press office">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/keyfacts/stories/licencefee2.shtml|title=TV Licence Fee: briefing|publisher=BBC|access-date=20 February 2014}}</ref> In reality, magistrates rarely impose the maximum fines allowed to them by law.

According to a 2013 TV Licensing briefing document, the level of fines and costs imposed by magistrates' courts vary considerably between different regions of England and Wales.<ref name ="TVL Briefing"/> In North Wales average fines and costs were stated to be £108.90 whilst offenders in the English Midlands area of "Black Country, Staffordshire & West Mercia" were required to pay £197.70.

Magistrates take into account the financial situation of the defendant when imposing fines.<ref name="magistrates sentencing">{{cite web|url=http://sentencingcouncil.judiciary.gov.uk/docs/MCSG_Update9_October_2012.pdf|title=Magistrates' Court Sentencing Guidelines|publisher=Sentencing Guidelines Council|access-date=4 March 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140304163220/http://sentencingcouncil.judiciary.gov.uk/docs/MCSG_Update9_October_2012.pdf|archive-date=4 March 2014|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> They also take into account: whether it is a first offence; if a TV licence has been purchased and the length of time a defendant was unlicensed. The following are regarded as 'factors indicating lower culpability' which can result in mitigation of the sentence:<ref name="magistrates sentencing"/>
* Accidental oversight or belief licence held
* Confusion of responsibility
* Licence immediately obtained
A guilty plea may also result in a lower fine.

According to TV Licensing: "many evaders claim that an enquiry officer told them they would not be prosecuted if they bought a licence". However, it is also pointed out that "it is a disciplinary offence for an enquiry officer to say or suggest this".<ref name ="TVL Briefing"/> Nevertheless, the same TV Licensing briefing does say that: "first-time evaders may escape prosecution if they purchase a licence immediately".<ref name ="TVL Briefing">{{cite web|url=https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/tv_licensing_briefing_court_trai|title=TV Licensing briefing – court training time, costs and information|publisher=whatdotheyknow.com |access-date=20 February 2014}}</ref>

In Northern Ireland, prosecutions are the responsibility of the BBC and are carried out by its contractor, Capita, in magistrates' courts.<ref name="Northern Ireland">{{cite web|url=http://www.courtsni.gov.uk/en-GB/Publications/Public_Consultation/Documents/Costs%20in%20criminal%20cases%20(magistrates’%20courts)%20-%20Summary%20of%20responses%20to%20the%20consultation/Summary%20of%20responses%20to%20costs%20consultation.pdf|title=Magistrates' Courts Rules Committee Costs in criminal cases (magistrates' courts)|publisher=Northern Ireland Courts and Tribunals Service |access-date=22 July 2014}}</ref> The prosecution process is very similar to that of England and Wales.<ref name ="Prosecution flow"/>

In 2008, 5,272 people in Northern Ireland were prosecuted for non-payment of the television licence fee of which 4,118 were fined. The corresponding figures for 2007 were 5,901 people prosecuted and 4,464 fines imposed.<ref name="NI prosecutions">{{cite web|title=Parliamentary Business|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100203/text/100203w0016.htm|website=www.parliament.uk|publisher=UK Government|access-date=11 August 2015}}</ref>

In Scotland, the [[Crown Office|Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Office]] undertakes prosecutions for TV licence evasion.<ref name="Procurator">{{cite web|url=http://www.copfs.gov.uk/involved-in-a-case/involved-in-a-case|title=Involved in a case|publisher=Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Office |access-date=21 July 2014}}</ref> Very few cases in Scotland come to court.

Instead of prosecution, in Scotland, TV licence fee evaders are usually asked by the Procurator Fiscal to pay a [[fiscal fine]] and a small number are simply given a warning. For example, in 2013–2014, just ten cases reached the courts whereas 12,969 people were asked to pay a fiscal fine, no action was taken in 275 cases, and 174 people were sent a warning. In addition, two people were asked to pay compensation and one person was offered the chance to pay a combination of fiscal fine and compensation.<ref name="fiscal fines">{{cite web|url=http://www.copfs.gov.uk/foi/responses-we-have-made-to-foi-requests/839-tv-licence-fiscal-fines|title=TV Licence – Fiscal Fines |publisher=COPFS|access-date=21 October 2014}}</ref> In 2013–14, almost all of the fiscal fines (12,603 out of 12,969) were at the level 2 rate of £75.<ref name="fiscal fines"/> In 2014–15, 13% of all fiscal fines in Scotland were issued for Communications Act offences, stated to be mainly TV licensing offences.

In the years 2016/17 and 2017/18, prosecutions against suspected licence fee evaders were reduced to single figures. In 2016/17, 5 people were prosecuted of which 4 were found guilty.

Initial investigations into licence fee evasion are carried out by Capita employees as in the UK. However, prosecutions are carried out by police and law officers.

==Opinions on the licence fee==

===Opinion polls===
In 2004, the BBC reported that "Almost 70% of people in the UK want changes to the way the BBC is funded", following an [[ICM (polling)|ICM]] poll for their current affairs programme ''[[Panorama (TV series)|Panorama]]'', which showed that 31% were in favour of the existing licence fee system, 36% said the BBC should be paid for by a subscription and 31% wanted advertising to pay for the programmes.<ref name=ICMpoll>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/3537567.stm |title=Majority 'want change to TV fee' |access-date=14 August 2008 |work=BBC News |publisher=BBC |date=6 March 2004 }}</ref>

In August 2008, the ''Guardian'' newspaper reported that "The BBC is facing an uphill battle to maintain support for the licence fee", stating that according to an [[Ipsos MORI]] poll the newspaper had commissioned, 41% agreed that the licence fee is an "appropriate funding mechanism" and 37% disagreed but when asked whether the licence fee is "good value for money", 47% disagreed, with more than half of them disagreeing strongly. The poll also showed that there is no longer a majority believing that the licence fee assured them of distinctive programming not available elsewhere ― which, the newspaper said, had long been one of the arguments for its existence: 41% of the population disagreed with only 30% agreeing. The poll also showed that opinion was split by a growing north–south and socio-economic divide.<ref name="Guardian2008-08-18">{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/aug/18/bbc.television3 |title=Broadcasting: Survey blow to BBC as public question case for licence fee |access-date=18 August 2008 |author=Owen Gibson |date=18 August 2008 |newspaper=The Guardian | location=London}}</ref>

In September 2009, the ''Guardian'' reported an ICM poll showing an increase in support for the licence fee to 43%; "The fee is backed by 43%, against 24% who think advertising should foot the bill and 30% who think people should pay to subscribe if they want to see BBC programmes. In 2004, only 31% backed the licence fee, 12 points lower than today.".<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/sep/04/bbc-icm-poll-james-murdoch |title=Public rejects Murdoch view of BBC, says ICM poll |access-date=20 December 2010 | location=London |work=The Guardian |first=Julian |last=Glover |date=4 September 2009}}</ref>

In 2013, according to an ICM poll for the ''Sunday Telegraph'', 70% stated that the BBC licence fee should be abolished or cut. 49% of those polled believed the fee should be scrapped altogether.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/bbc/10423117/BBC-licence-fee-should-be-cut-or-scrapped-poll-finds.html|title=BBC licence fee should be cut or scrapped, poll finds|first=Tim|last=Ross|date=2 November 2013|via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}</ref>

===Views of official bodies and policy institutes===
Previous inquiries, such as the parliamentary [[Peacock Committee]] in 1986 and the internal [[Gavyn Davies|Davies committee]] in 2000, recommended continuing the licence fee, with conditions. In 2001, an [[Ofcom]] report found that the vast majority of those it interviewed, including owners of digital television equipment, supported the principle of a licence fee to fund public service television and radio. The advantages of such funding listed by those interviewed included diversity, high quality, education, innovation, entertainment, information, original productions, [[Cultural pluralism|pluralism]], accessibility, inclusion of minorities and free access.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ofcom.org.uk/static/archive/itc/research/public_service_broadcasting.pdf |title=Public Service Broadcasting: What Viewers Want |access-date=13 August 2008 |work=ITC Research Publication |publisher=Independent Television Commission |date=January 2001 }}</ref> Another reason given in a response to Ofcom by the National Union of Journalists was that the licence fee allows the BBC to "retain independence" from both commercial and political pressures.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://media.gn.apc.org/creatorsrights/bbc-nuj-ofcom.html |title=Ofcom Review of Public Service Broadcasting: Response by National Union of Journalists |access-date=13 August 2008 |work=Creators' Rights Alliance web site |publisher=Creators' Rights Alliance <!--|date=Undated, after 5 December 2003--> }}</ref>

Nonetheless, having surveyed public opinion during December 2003, a finding of the Department for Culture, Media and Sport was that "the way the licence fee is set and collected raised issues about fairness".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbccharterreview.org.uk/publications/CR_PUBS/pub_wysabbc.html |title=What you said about the BBC |work=Review of the BBC's Royal Charter |access-date=12 August 2008 |publisher=Department for Culture, Media and Sport |date=July 2004 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081026051044/http://www.bbccharterreview.org.uk/publications/CR_PUBS/pub_wysabbc.html |archive-date=26 October 2008 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Further criticisms, embodied in a 2005 [[Green Paper]],<ref name="review2005">{{cite news|author=Department for Culture, Media, and Sport|year=2005|title=Review of the BBC's Royal Charter (Green Paper)|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/bsp/hi/pdfs/02_03_05_bbcgreen.pdf|access-date=18 June 2006 | work=BBC News}}</ref> included cost, value for money, whether or not the BBC should be publicly funded, the high cost of collection and enforcement and the [[Television licensing in the United Kingdom#Licence fee enforcement|methods used]].

Meanwhile, in 2004, the [[Institute for Public Policy Research]] criticised the TV licence fee for its regressive impact, pointing out that it represents a much higher proportion of income for poor households, that evaders are most likely to be single parents, lone tenants, pensioners and the economically inactive and that the difficulties they have in paying the licence fee are compounded by the penalties enforced for non-payment.<ref name="IPPR">{{cite web |url=http://www.ippr.org.uk/pressreleases/archive.asp?id=762&fID=60 |title=BBC Review should consider licence fee concessions |access-date=13 August 2008 |work=Press Release |publisher=Institute for Public Policy Research |date=27 December 2003 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080629022755/http://www.ippr.org.uk/pressreleases/archive.asp?id=762&fID=60 |archive-date=29 June 2008 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

Other technologies for receiving visual media, such as [[mobile phones]] and computers connected to the Internet, has led to questions over whether or not a licence fee based on television receiver ownership can continue to be justified when a television receiver is no longer the sole medium over which the BBC distributes its content;<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.economist.com/displaystory.cfm?story_id=3719919 |title=Reforming the BBC |access-date=16 August 2008 |date=3 March 2005 |newspaper=The Economist }}</ref> and these technological changes led the Department for Culture, Media and Sport to state in 2005 that the collection of a fixed charge based on television ownership may become difficult to sustain.<ref name="review2005" />

In 2006, the [[House of Lords]] [[Select committee (United Kingdom)|select committee]] on BBC Charter Review criticised the reclassification of the licence fee as a tax, pointing out that the BBC was in consequence reclassified as a central government body, with "significant implications for the BBC's independence".<ref name="Select Committee 20060303"/>

In a debate in the UK Parliament in October 2013, the licence fee was referred to as 'a flat-rate poll tax' and as 'probably the UK's most regressive tax'<ref name="Parliament debate">{{cite web |url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131021/debtext/131021-0002.htm#1310215000001|title=Future of the BBC

Some critics{{who|date=March 2014}} claim that the licensing system interferes with the freedom to receive information and contend that this is a contravention of Article 10 of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] (the right to [[freedom of expression]]).<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/article811195.ece |title=Mean fields: Naked into the TV courtroom |access-date=15 September 2008 |author=Jonathan Miller |date=12 January 2003 |work=Sunday Times |publisher=Times Newspapers Ltd | location=London}}</ref> In a case dealing with the German [[Television licence#Germany|radio licence]], the [[ECHR]] in Application No. 26907/95 stated "Such an undertaking cannot be successfully accomplished unless it is grounded in the principle of [[Cultural pluralism|pluralism]], of which the State is the ultimate guarantor." and "The interference complained of was, therefore, [[necessary in a democratic society]].

The group was featured on [[Dan Wootton|Dan Wootton's]] [[Talkradio|talkRADIO]] show and currently has over 90,000 Twitter followers.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/1294308/BBC-News-Campaign-Defund-the-BBC-licence-fee-payments |title=New campaign to ‘Defund the BBC’ sees explosion in support after launch |publisher=[[Daily Express]] |access-date=7 July 2020 |date=11 June 2020}} </ref>

===Opinions on collection and enforcement methods===
In September 2008, the BBC's governing body, the BBC Trust, launched a review of TV Licensing's methods,<ref name= "bbctrust2009">{{cite web |url=http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/bbctrust/assets/files/pdf/review_report_research/tvl/tvl_report.pdf |title=Trust review of licence fee collection |access-date=5 May 2015 |publisher=BBC Trust |date= March 2009 }}</ref> following complaints about "heavy-handed" and "intimidating" tactics<ref name="BBCTrustReview">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7603258.stm |title=Review of TV licence fee tactics |access-date=8 September 2008 |date=8 September 2008 |work=BBC News Web Site |publisher=BBC}}</ref> and during December 2008, it was reported by the press that the chairman of the all-party Commons Culture, Media and Sport committee had accused TV Licensing of behaving "like the [[Gestapo]]", employing "tactics that are outrageous", saying: "The tactics used by TV Licensing in their letters are intimidatory and cause genuine distress. Their records are not always correct, but they write letters that assume members of the public are criminals".<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/3741846/BBC-sacks-contractor-over-licence-fee-warning-letters-containing-false-statistics.html |title=BBC sacks contractor over licence fee warning letters containing false statistics |access-date=18 December 2008 |author=Alex Singleton |date=14 December 2008 |work=Daily Telegraph |publisher=Telegraph Media Group Limited | location=London}}</ref>

In 2008, the former BBC television star, [[Noel Edmonds]], stated that he had stopped paying his TV licence in a protest at the tone of BBC adverts aimed at TV licence evaders.<ref name="Noel Edmonds">{{cite news|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/showbiz/noel-edmonds-i-wont-pay-tv-licence-because-of-threatening-bbc-adverts-6820313.html|title=Noel Edmonds: 'I won't pay TV licence because of 'threatening' BBC adverts |newspaper=London Evening Standard  |access-date=18 April 2013}}</ref>

===Isle of Man===
The licensing system remains controversial in the Isle of Man due to the fact that the licence fee remains the same as in the UK and Channel Islands, even though the BBC provides neither a local television news service for the Isle of Man (similar to [[BBC Channel Islands News|BBC Channel Islands]]) nor any BBC [[BBC Local Radio|local radio]] or national radio opt-out station.  The BBC has sought to redress the lack of coverage by improving its [[BBC News Online|online news service]] for the Isle of Man, with permanent BBC staff based at the [[Manx Radio]] studios in [[Douglas, Isle of Man|Douglas]].  A [[Select committee (United Kingdom)|select committee]] of [[Tynwald]] was established in 2009 to investigate the value for money of the licensing system for the Isle of Man, and the feasibility of the Isle of Man withdrawing from it.

==The future of the licence fee==

The current Royal Charter for the BBC expires on 31 December 2027<ref name= "Charter">{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/bbc-charter-and-framework-agreement|title=BBC Charter and Framework Agreement|publisher=GOV.UK  |access-date=16 January 2016}}</ref> and the TV licence fee itself was fixed at £145.50 until March 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/77800/Lyons_BBC.pdf|title=BBC Funding Settlement |publisher=UK Government|access-date=24 June 2013}}</ref> After this time, the fee will increase in line with inflation for five years until 2022;<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.itv.com/news/update/2016-05-12/bbc-licence-fee-to-rise-in-line-with-inflation/|title=BBC licence fee to rise 'in line with inflation'|newspaper=ITV News|access-date=2017-01-16}}</ref> the price was raised to £147.<ref name="guardian-freezeraise">{{cite web|title=Television licence fee increases to £147 in first rise since 2010|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/mar/01/television-licence-fee-increases-147|website=The Guardian|access-date=16 May 2017}}</ref><ref name="bbc-uklicinflat">{{cite web|title=TV licence fee to rise to £147 in April, government announces|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-39130964|website=BBC News|access-date=17 May 2017}}</ref>

The government stated that "while the current licence fee collection system is in operation, the current system of criminal deterrence and prosecution should be maintained".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/553380/InformationSheet-Funding_2016_09_15.pdf|title=BBC Charter Review 2016 Information Sheet - Funding|website=GOV.UK|publisher=UK Government|access-date=16 January 2017}}</ref>

In June 2019, it was announced that free TV licences that are funded by the Government for all over-75s would be abolished in June 2020. 

The TV Licensing website states that, "From 1 June 2020, there will be a new scheme. Under the new scheme, anyone aged 75 or over who receives Pension Credit will still be eligible for a free TV Licence which the BBC will pay for. Households where there is no one aged 75 or over that receives Pension Credit will need to buy a licence if one is needed." This has now been delayed to 1 August 2020, in part due to the [[Covid-19 pandemic]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tvlicensing.co.uk/age?wt.mc_id=bbc_pr_o75_english}}</ref>

During the [[2019 UK general election|2019 general election campaign]], [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Boris Johnson]] said the government would consider decriminalising non-payment of the television licence, a move which the BBC warned could cost it £200 million a year.<ref>{{cite web|title=BBC: TV licence fee decriminalisation being considered |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2019-50800128|website=[[BBC News]] |date=15 December 2019 |access-date=7 July 2020}}</ref>

==Notes==
The Communications (Television Licensing) Regulations 2004<ref name="commregs"/> gives the following definition:

* "television receiver" means any apparatus installed or used for the purpose of receiving (whether by means of wireless telegraphy or otherwise) any television programme service, whether or not it is installed or used for any other purpose.
* any reference to receiving a television programme service includes a reference to receiving by any means any programme included in that service, where that programme is received at the same time (or virtually the same time) as it is received by members of the public by virtue of its being broadcast or distributed as part of that service.
