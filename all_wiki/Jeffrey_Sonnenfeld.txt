== Biography ==
===Early life===
Born in [[Philadelphia]], April 1, 1954, Jeffrey Sonnenfeld is the son of Burton Sonnenfeld, a men's clothing retailer, and Rochelle Sonnenfeld, a healthcare planner and community leader, who came to the US as a refugee immigrant from Russian pogroms. Sonnenfeld attended public schools in Cheltenham and [[Abington Senior High School|Abington]] [[Abington Township, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania|townships]] in suburban [[Montgomery County, Pennsylvania]] and was an active school leader. While his summers were spent working in the community as an [[Eagle Scout (Boy Scouts of America)|Eagle Scout]] counselor, he worked through the year in his parents’ retail clothing store in nearby Hatboro, Pennsylvania.  He earned his AB, MBA, and doctorate at [[Harvard University]], and during his undergraduate days, he was President of WHRB, the college radio station, as well as an oarsmen.  At age 26, he joined the faculty of the [[Harvard Business School]] where he taught for 10 years.<ref name=rifkin/>

===Early career - corporate societal impact===
As a professor at the Harvard Business School, he was the founding faculty sponsor of the Harvard-Radcliffe Women's Leadership Forum. He published his first two articles in the [[Harvard Business Review]] at age 24.  In “[http://hbr.org/1978/07/why-do-companies-succumb-to-price-fixing/ar/1 Why Do Companies Succumb to Price Fixing?]” he interviewed leaders as they left prison for illegal collusion, to understand their justification for knowingly committing white collar crimes. In “Dealing with an Aging Work force,” he explored the gaps between the changing labor demography and related corporate retirement policies,<ref>Yale School of Management, Faculty Publications, http://qn.som.yale.edu/faculty-research/faculty-directory/selected-publications/8268</ref> and subsequently served on the board of the National Council on Aging and the President's Advisory Council of the AARP.

===Midcareer - CEO leadership===
His later books focused on executive careers and succession studies.  His work on strategic staffing presented a model of four types of cultures: baseball teams; clubs; academies; and fortresses.  His book on [[CEO succession]], ''The Hero's Farewell: What Happens when CEOs Retire'' (Oxford University Press, 1988) was the first systematic study of the impact of the exiting incumbent leader upon their organization. In studying the succession of a generation of prominent business leaders, he revealed two frequently misunderstood motives of leaders, in late career:  Heroic Mission - a quest for immortal legacy and Heroic Stature - a quest for renown identity. He also developed a typology of departure styles labeled: monarchs; ambassadors; generals; and governors. Based upon this work, Sonnenfeld was asked to head the Blue Ribbon Commission on CEO Succession of the National Association of Corporate Directors.<ref>Oxford University Press, http://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-heros-farewell-9780195065831?cc=us&lang=en&tab=reviews</ref>

Following the publication of ''The Hero's Farewell,'' he left Harvard in 1989 to launch the first school for incumbent CEOs at Emory University, now known as Yale Chief Executive Leadership Institute. These events produced many firsts such as the first educational forum for media leaders which unified entertainment; journalism, technology, and telecom leaders and the first financial services leadership events to unite insurance, banking, mutual funds, investment banks, and savings and loan leaders with top government regulators. Leaders in converging fields such as Sumner Redstone of Viacom; Michael Dell; Steve Case of AOL; and Ted Turner of Turner Broadcasting met each other at these programs. While at Emory, Sonnenfeld was heavily involved in the Atlanta community, working as an advisor to the leadership of the Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games; a member of the Governor's Personnel Review Commission; and a commissioner of the local county economic development council.

===Move to Yale University===
After a decade at Emory University, Sonnenfeld joined the faculty at Yale, bringing with him the CEO College and launching the Chief Executive Leadership Institute, where it still resides.<ref>Yale School of Management, Chief Executive Leadership Institute, CEO College, {{cite web |url=http://celi.som.yale.edu/ceo-college |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-05-20 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130720102943/http://celi.som.yale.edu/ceo-college |archive-date=2013-07-20 |df= }}</ref> At Yale, he built a new department of Executive Programs, offering 35 programs a year to roughly 2,000 top leaders with sessions in New Haven, New York, Beijing, Delhi, Mumbai, and Shanghai, and opened Yale University's first outpost in Washington, DC in 2011 with support from [[Lynn Tilton]] of Patriarch Partners and Leslie Miller Saointz.

His 2007 book, ''Firing Back'' (with Andrew Ward, Harvard Business School Press), studies the paths to resilience for felled CEOs, as well as victims from natural disasters, warfare, and other forms of disruption and adversity. ''Firing Back'' looks at various societal and psychological barriers to recovery and offers guidelines for getting lives back on track with a focus on how tragedy is critical for defining heroic careers. At Yale he teaches courses on leading strategic change and executive careers.

At Yale SOM, Sonnenfeld teaches the popular course "Strategic Leadership Across Sectors", which is consistently the school's most popular and oversubscribed course. Sonnenfeld's previous students from Harvard, Emory, and Yale have gone on to become CEOs, political leaders, and leaders in a wide variety of fields.<ref name=rifkin/>

Sonnenfeld continues to be active in the local community, as a director of Art Space New Haven, a leader in the United Way annual campaign, and a director of the Calvin Hill School. His older brother, Marc Sonnenfeld, is a partner at Morgan, Lewis & Bockius in Philadelphia.<ref>Marc Sonnenfeld (bio).
