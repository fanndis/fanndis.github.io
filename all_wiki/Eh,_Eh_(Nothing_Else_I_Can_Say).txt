"'''Eh, Eh (Nothing Else I Can Say)'''" is a song by American singer [[Lady Gaga]], from her debut album, ''[[The Fame]]'' (2008). It was released as the third [[Single (music)|single]] from the album in Australia, New Zealand and selected European countries, and the fourth single in France. The song is a [[Calypso music|calypso]]-styled, mid-tempo ballad, and is about breaking up with one's old partner and finding someone new. "Eh, Eh (Nothing Else I Can Say)" received mixed reviews from US-based critics, who denoted it as "dry and lifeless", blaming it for halting the "bad-girl party atmosphere" of ''The Fame''.

Failing to match the popularity of her previous singles, the song peaked at number fifteen on the Australian [[ARIA Charts]] and at number nine on the [[Recording Industry Association of New Zealand|RIANZ charts]] of New Zealand. It proved to be successful in Sweden, where it managed to peak at number two on the [[Sverigetopplistan]] chart, as well as in the Czech Republic, France, and Hungary, where it reached the top-ten of their respective charts. "Eh, Eh (Nothing Else I Can Say)" received Gold certifications for its sales in Australia, Denmark, New Zealand, and the United States.

The accompanying [[Italian-American]] 1950s-themed music video portrayed Gaga and her friends roaming around the streets of an Italian neighborhood, Gaga riding a [[Vespa]] and also singing the song while at home with her boyfriend. The video was noted for its contrasting portrayal of Gaga doing feminine work, as compared to her previous endeavours. She performed "Eh, Eh (Nothing Else I Can Say)" on her first headlining concert tour, [[The Fame Ball Tour]], wearing a black-and-white [[leotard]], and during the first legs of [[The Monster Ball Tour]], while standing inside a giant [[gyroscope]].

==Background and composition==
"Eh, Eh" was written by Gaga with [[Martin Kierszenbaum]], who also produced the track. It was recorded at Cherrytree Recording Studios in [[Santa Monica, California]].<ref name="liner"/> In 2005, Kierszenbaum founded [[Cherrytree Records]] along with [[Jimmy Iovine]], then chairman of [[Interscope Records]]. After signing a number of artists, he worked with then-unknown Gaga on her debut album, ''[[The Fame]]'', producing and writing four songs with her, including the title track. One of these songs was "Eh, Eh (Nothing Else I Can Say)". During recording the track, Gaga fashioned a nickname for Kierszenbaum, called "Cherry Cherry Boom Boom". They kept the nickname in all the four songs they had worked on. Kierszenbaum later carried on the nickname in all his future projects.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cherrycherryboomboom.com/main/about/ |title=The Cherry Cherry Boom Boom Decoder |publisher=[[Cherrytree Records]] Official site.

The video starts out showing [[Arthur Avenue, Bronx|Little Italy]], an icon of the [[Madonna (art)|Madonna and Child]], and then Gaga riding a Vespa. The first twenty seconds are mainly full of camera shots of different men, Gaga, and the city. The singer roams around with some friends, laughing and joking in a restaurant, while she stands on the seat.<ref name=popeater/> Gaga then comes from around the block walking with her friends in pace and singing in the camera. Next, she is shown sleeping in a bed, and waking up to reveal pink high-heeled shoes. She sings and cooks for a man in a house while dancing.<ref name=popeater/> She irons clothes while the man is on phone screaming at someone. The two [[harlequin]] [[Great Danes]] who appear at the start of her "[[Poker Face (Lady Gaga song)|Poker Face]]" music video, also appear in this one. Finally she lies on a sofa with her legs up on the man. One of the last scene shows her in a yellow dress made of flowers and wearing a yellow watch while singing to the song with a unique hairstyle which shows her hair pulled up and folded over. Then the camera quickly goes back to her in bed.<ref name=popeater/>

David Balls from [[Digital Spy]] noted Gaga's homage to her Italian-American roots in the video, but wondered if Gaga would "overexpose herself" with the video.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/thesound/a145553/eh-eh-its-another-lady-gaga-video.html#~oWDVzLlhj6bkzT|title=Eh Eh... It's another Lady GaGa video!|last=Balls|first=David|date=February 4, 2009|accessdate=November 25, 2014|website=[[Digital Spy]]|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924170234/http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/thesound/a145553/eh-eh-its-another-lady-gaga-video.html#~oWDVzLlhj6bkzT|archivedate=September 24, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Like his review of the single, Moralde found the video to be complementing the simplistic composition of the song. He believed that with the videos for previous singles, "Just Dance" and "Poker Face", Gaga's persona was established, but with the video for "Eh, Eh" she traversed her persona from the original Stefani Germanotta that she was born, to the character Lady Gaga.<ref name="popate"/> He explained: "What's striking about it is how much it feels like Lady Gaga is playacting: the video has a nostalgic, dreamlike tone. Set in a stylized pastel 1950s Little Italy, the video plays heavily with stereotypical and historical shorthand as it displays moustached chefs, macho men in wife beaters, cute Vespas, and spaghetti and meatballs." He noted that with all of these activities, Gaga created an essential fashion dollhouse, by playing feminine characters.<ref name="popate"/>

But Gaga addressed the viewer directly in the video while singing the song, which led Moralde to deduce that "She's not in the moment, but is instead playing a feminized role in a dreamlike space; this quality is accentuated by the bright and blown-out color palette, and the numerous shots of Gaga in bed or sleeping. The cumulative effect is that it asserts the Lady Gaga of the previous videos to be the real one, and the Gaga in 'Eh, Eh' is a character that she is playing."<ref name="popate"/> His view was shared by Chris Kingston from ''[[The Harvard Crimson]]'' who noted during the release of the music video for Gaga's 2010 single "[[Telephone (song)|Telephone]]", that the video shows "the crazy party girl we know [...] actually has a weirdly girlish, domestic side."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2010/3/23/lady-gaga-telephone-popscreen/|title=POPSCREEN: Lady Gaga ft.

The personality portrayed in the "Eh, Eh" video was named as "Friendly Peer" archetype; someone with a girl-next-door image and approachable behavior.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Oxford Handbook of Sound and Image in Digital Media|page=541|first=Carol|last= Vernallis|first2= Amy |last2=Herzog|first3=John |last3=Richardson|year=2014|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|isbn=9780199757640}}</ref>

Gaga also performed the song at the [[Glastonbury Festival 2009|2009 Glastonbury Festival]]. Although the show was part of The Fame Ball Tour, many elements were different than on usual tour dates.
