==Career as foreign minister==
Tarasyuk served as deputy of foreign minister from 9 March 1992 until 16 September 1995.
In 1995 – 1998 he was ambassador in Belgium, Luxembourg, Netherlands and Ukraine representative in [[NATO]].
He became foreign minister for the first time from 17 April 1998 until 29 September 2000. He later broke with President [[Leonid Kuchma]], and became a foreign relations adviser to [[Viktor Yushchenko]], the main opposition candidate in the [[2004 Ukrainian presidential election|2004 presidential elections]]. After Ukraine's [[Orange Revolution]], Tarasyuk became foreign minister again on 4 February 2005, and served in the Cabinets of [[Yulia Tymoshenko]], [[Yuriy Yekhanurov]], and [[Viktor Yanukovych]]. Tarasyuk favors Ukrainian integration with the [[European Union]].

Tarasyuk was formally dismissed by the [[Verkhovna Rada]] on 1 December 2006. He disputed this dismissal in Kyiv [[Shevchenkivskyi District, Kiev|Shevchenkivskyi District]] court, and on 5 December parliament's decision was reversed on the grounds that it violated Ukrainian law. On the same day, Yushchenko issued a decree that Tarasyuk must keep his job.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.president.gov.ua/news/data/6_12314.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20070423040331/http://www.president.gov.ua/news/data/6_12314.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=23 April 2007 |title=Shevchenkivskyi district court ruled that the Verkhovna rada dismissal of Tarasyuk is ineffective |accessdate=21 May 2007 |work=Official website of the [[President of Ukraine]] |language=Ukrainian }}</ref>

Despite this court order and presidential decree, he was not allowed to enter [[Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine|cabinet]] meetings and this caused political conflict based on interpretations of amendments to [[Constitution of Ukraine|Constitution]]. On 30 January 2007 Tarasyuk announced his resignation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/01/30/news/ukraine.php |title=Ukraine president loses one of his last remaining cabinet allies |date= 30 January 2007 |work=International Herald Tribune |language=Ukrainian}}</ref> In 2009, he served as the Chairman of the [[Committee of the Verkhovna Rada on issues of European integration]].

==Institute for Euro-Atlantic Cooperation==

Borys Tarasyuk is the founder of the [[Institute for Euro-Atlantic Cooperation]] (''IEAC''), a [[political action committee]] established to campaign for [[NATO]]- and [[European Union]] memberships in Ukraine. The group is funded by [[Dollar diplomacy|Western donations]] and is open about its goals. The IEAC' logo juxtaposes the [[flag of Ukraine]] with the logos of NATO and the European Union. Polls cited by Tarasyuk showed that only between 18% and 22% of Ukraine's population supported NATO-membership in 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.csdr.org/2005book/tarasyuk.htm |title=The Orange Revolution: Six Months Later |date=10–12 June 2007 |work=Center for Strategic Decision Research }}</ref> The percentage has increased to 47% by 2014.<ref>Goncharenko, Roman. "[http://www.dw.de/what-ukraine-wants-from-nato/a-17896198 What Ukraine wants from NATO]". ''DW''. 3 September 2014. Retrieved 5 November 2014.</ref>

The Institute for Euro-Atlantic Cooperation has influenced Ukraine state policy in the past.  For example, a report produced by the Institute titled ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20060529033413/http://moldova.org/download/eng/510/ Trilateral Plan for Solving the Transnistrian Issue]'' recommended changes to the customs regime relating to Transnistria. Less than five weeks after the report's publication, the recommendations were implement and signed into law.  [[Ukraine-Transnistria border customs conflict]] followed on 3 March 2006. The [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] (''OSCE''), the [[European Union]], and the United States backed the legislation, while Russia opposed it.
