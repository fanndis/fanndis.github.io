The '''2010 United Kingdom student protests''' were a series of [[Demonstration (people)|demonstrations]] in November and December 2010 that took place in several areas of the country, with the focal point of protests being in [[central London]]. Largely student-led, the protests were held in opposition to planned spending cuts to [[further education]] and an increase of the cap on [[Tuition fees in the United Kingdom|tuition fees]] by the [[Cameron–Clegg coalition|Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government]] following their [[Browne Review|review into higher education funding]] in England. Student groups said that the intended cuts to education were excessive, would damage higher education, give students higher debts, and broke campaign promises made by politicians.

The first major demonstration occurred on 10 November, jointly organised by the [[National Union of Students (United Kingdom)|National Union of Students]] (NUS) and the [[University and College Union]] (UCU). It involved between 30,000 and 50,000 demonstrators marching through central London, with several hundred branching off to attack and occupy the Conservative Party headquarters. This measure brought condemnation from the establishment and a divide within the student movement over the appropriateness of such tactics. The [[Student Left Network|National Campaign Against Fees and Cuts]] (NCAFC) called for a mass walk-out and demonstration on 24 November, with occupations taking place at campuses throughout the UK. A march in central London was [[kettling|kettled]] in [[Whitehall]], resulting in violent confrontation with protesters. Further demonstrations were held in central London on 30 November, when police clashed with protesters and kettled them in [[Trafalgar Square]], while other protests took place throughout the country. Another central London protest took place on 9 December, the day that the proposed reforms were passed into law, with protesters clashing with police and being kettled in [[Parliament Square]].

The student protests were unsuccessful in their aim of preventing the government's reforms. The demonstrations had been highly controversial in the UK, being condemned for instances of violence and vandalism by both the establishment and by protestors. The behaviour of the [[Metropolitan Police]] in dealing with the protests was also widely criticised for alleged instances of untruthfulness and excessive use of force.

== Background ==

===The Browne Report and proposed reforms===
[[File:Clegg Victory for the Gurkhas.jpg|300px|thumb|right|Prime Minister [[David Cameron]] (left) and Deputy Prime Minister [[Nick Clegg]] (right) were at the heart of much student anger]]

In November 2009, the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] government of Prime Minister [[Gordon Brown]] commissioned a study into higher education funding in England. Chaired by [[John Browne, Baron Browne of Madingley|Lord Browne of Madingley]], the former chief executive of [[BP]], the report was to be titled the [[Browne Review]].<ref>{{cite news|author=Polly Curtis|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2009/nov/09/tuition-fees-rise-review-universities |title=Former BP head to run tuition fees review &#124; Education |work=The Guardian |location=London |date= 9 November 2009|accessdate=16 May 2010}}</ref>
In the build up to the [[2010 United Kingdom general election|United Kingdom General Election in May 2010]], the leader of the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]], [[Nick Clegg]], [[Vote for Students pledge|pledged]] that he would vote against any proposed increase in tuition fees if elected to Parliament.<ref name="Clegg">{{Cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-11732787 |title=Nick Clegg regrets signing anti-tuition fees pledge |publisher=BBC News |date=11 November 2010| accessdate=11 November 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101113230950/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-11732787| archivedate= 13 November 2010| url-status= live}}</ref>

Following the election and resulting [[hung parliament]], Clegg made an agreement with the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] to form a [[Cameron–Clegg coalition|coalition government]] in which Conservative leader [[David Cameron]] became Prime Minister and Clegg became Deputy Prime Minister. The Browne Review was subsequently published in October 2010, and contained the suggestion that the government should remove outright the existing cap of £3,290 on [[Tuition fees (UK)|tuition fees]]. The government rejected this proposal, instead choosing to keep a cap but increasing it to £9,000.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-11483638 |title=Q&A: University funding |publisher=BBC |date=9 December 2010|accessdate=13 December 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101216044737/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-11483638| archivedate= 16 December 2010| url-status= live}}</ref>

[[David Willetts]], the Minister of State for Universities and Science, stated that the measures were "a very progressive package" and "at the end of this we will have a better university system than we have at the moment."<ref name="Student tuition"/> Contravening his pre-election pledge, Clegg expressed support for the rise in the cap on tuition fees, which would result in future students paying higher fees for their university education.<ref name="Nick Clegg">{{Cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-11724842 |title=Nick Clegg under fire in Commons over tuition fee rise |publisher=BBC News |date=10 November 2010| accessdate=11 November 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101111070753/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-11724842| archivedate= 11 November 2010| url-status= live}}</ref>

===Student opposition===

Student union leaders were critical of the cuts. The [[National Union of Students (United Kingdom)|National Union of Students]] (NUS) feared that the increased cap on tuition fees would prevent potential students from poorer backgrounds from attending university.<ref name="Cameron's response">{{Cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-11732264|title=Tuition fees protest 'unacceptable' says PM |publisher=BBC News |date=11 November 2010| accessdate=11 November 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101111080607/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-11732264| archivedate= 11 November 2010| url-status= live}}</ref>
Many protesters focused in particular on Clegg's campaign promise that he would oppose any rise in tuition fees. David Barclay, the president of the [[University of Oxford]]'s student union, said: "This is the day a generation of politicians learn that though they might forget their promises, students won't."<ref name="Student tuition"/> Rahul Mansigani, the students' union president for the [[University of Cambridge]], said: "Large numbers of students voted for the Liberal Democrats, and there is no question that the pledge is a binding commitment."<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/letters/8062185/Oxford-and-Cambridge-students-oppose-fee-increase.html |title=Oxford and Cambridge students oppose fee increase |work=The Telegraph|date=14 October 2010| accessdate=11 November 2010|location=London| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101030150622/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/letters/8062185/Oxford-and-Cambridge-students-oppose-fee-increase.html| archivedate= 30 October 2010| url-status= live}}</ref>

Two weeks before, on 28 October, a protest was held in the University of Oxford to coincide with a visit from the Liberal Democrat minister and Business Secretary [[Vince Cable]]. Cable cancelled his visit after taking advice from the police about the protest.<ref>{{cite news|last=Harrison |first=Angela |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-11646976 |title=BBC News – Oxford students stage tuition fees protest |publisher=BBC |date=28 October 2010|accessdate=4 December 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101102070736/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-11646976| archivedate= 2 November 2010| url-status= live}}</ref> Several days later, on 3 November, there was a [[2010 student protest in Dublin|student protest in Dublin]].

At the end of the march, a [[political rally|rally]] took place outside [[Tate Britain]] where demonstrators were addressed by the UCU general secretary Sally Hunt, who introduced a series of clips displayed on a giant plasma screen featuring Clegg giving a series of promises to the electorate on tuition fees, all of which he had subsequently broken.<ref name="Channel 4"/> Hunt stated that making the public university system in Britain "the most expensive in the world" was unfair, that discouraging young people from going to college was not progressive, and that the increase in tuition fees represented further debts for students.<ref name="promote" /> The rally was also addressed by NUS President [[Aaron Porter]] and the [[Trades Union Congress]] Deputy general secretary [[Frances O'Grady]].<ref name="promote" /> O'Grady offered the message to the government that: "Don't you dare tell us we're all in this together.

=== Response to the Millbank occupation ===

====Students and unions====
NUS President Aaron Porter condemned the occupation of 30 Millbank, claiming that it was caused by "those who are here to cause trouble" and that he was "disgusted that the actions of a minority of idiots are trying to undermine 50,000 who came to make a peaceful protest."<ref name="Student Protest"/> General Secretary of UCU Sally Hunt also condemned the occupation, declaring that "the overwhelming majority of staff and students on the march came here to send a clear and peaceful message to the politicians.... The actions of a minority, out of 50,000 people, is regrettable."<ref name="NI students"/> Oxford University's Student Union (OUSU) President David Barclay issued a statement declaring that "OUSU supports the rights of students to protest non-violently. It is hugely unfortunate that some people yesterday were injured and that arrests were made."<ref name="Youth Revolt">{{Cite news |url=http://www.cherwell.org/content/11006|title=Student protest: youth in revolt |publisher=Cherwell |date=12 November 2010| accessdate=12 November 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101115050149/http://www.cherwell.org/content/11006| archivedate= 15 November 2010| url-status= live}}</ref>

Contrastingly, other student leaders, trade unionists, and academics expressed support for elements of the occupation of 30 Millbank. Amongst others, the president of University of London Union [[Clare Solomon]], the Education Officer of the London School of Economics, Ashok Kumar, the Education and Campaigns Officer at University College London, Michael Chessum, the National Union of Students' black students' officer Kanjay Sesay, the NUS' LGBT students' officers Vicki Baars and Alan Bailey, the President of the [[National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers|RMT]] trade union Alex Gordon and the playwright [[Lee Hall (playwright)|Lee Hall]] all signed a statement declaring that:

<blockquote>We reject any attempt to characterise the Millbank protest as small, "extremist" or unrepresentative of our movement. We celebrate the fact that thousands of students were willing to send a message to the Tories that we will fight to win.

====Government and press====
[[File:Tory Scum.jpg|300px|thumb|right|Anti-Conservative graffiti scrawled during the protest.]]
The Metropolitan Police Service admitted that they were unprepared to deal with the occupation of 30 Millbank, something which they had not been expecting. [[Paul Stephenson (police officer)|Sir Paul Stephenson]], the Metropolitan Police's Commissioner, told the press that he was "embarrassed" by how police had lost control of the situation, and condemned what he saw as "thuggish, loutish behaviour by criminals."<ref name="Met"/> Stephenson remarked that "the one thing I would say is that it must have been an awful time for the people trying to go about their daily business in those buildings. I feel terribly sorry that they have had to go through what must have been quite a traumatic experience… We are determined to make sure that sort of thing does not happen again on our streets. I'm clear on that, the Met is clear on that."<ref name="Met"/> His views were echoed by [[Mayor of London]] [[Boris Johnson]], who stated: "This is intolerable and all those involved will be pursued and they will face the full force of the law… The Metropolitan Police commissioner has assured me that there will be a vigorous post-incident investigation. He will also be reviewing police planning and response."<ref name="Met"/>

Prime Minister [[David Cameron]] condemned the occupation of Millbank, stating that he would not abandon his position on the issue of education cuts. Speaking from the [[2010 G-20 Seoul summit]] in South Korea, Cameron said the occasion had been "extremely serious" and praised the "bravery" of the police officers. He also stated that the actions of the protesters were "unacceptable" and that "I was worried for the safety of the people in the building because I know people who work there".<ref name="Cameron's response"/> The following morning, Clegg went on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]'s ''[[Daybreak (2010 TV programme)|Daybreak]]'' to state: "I should have been more careful perhaps in signing that pledge [to not increase tuition fees]... At the time [prior to his election] I really thought we could do it. I just didn't know, of course, before we came into government, quite what the state of the finances were."<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.itv.com/daybreak/news/nickcleggdefendsthecoalition|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120903211504/http://www.itv.com/daybreak/news/nickcleggdefendsthecoalition|url-status=dead|archive-date=3 September 2012|publisher=ITV |date=11 November 2010|title=ITV Daybreak Interview |accessdate=11 November 2010}}</ref>

A reporter from ''The Daily Telegraph'' commented that the "anarchic behaviour" of those occupying Millbank was "counter-productive" to the students' cause, and that it was the photographs of "a few hundred vicious hotheads" that would "linger" in the public imagination rather than that of the main march.<ref name="Infantile behaviour">{{Cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/universityeducation/8124531/Student-tuition-fee-protest-Infantile-behaviour.html|title=Student tuition fee protest: Infantile behaviour|work=The Telegraph Online |date=10 November 2010| accessdate=10 November 2010|location=London| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101112073344/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/universityeducation/8124531/Student-tuition-fee-protest-Infantile-behaviour.html| archivedate= 12 November 2010| url-status= live}}</ref> The ''[[Financial Times]]'' reported that an anonymous vice-chancellor from a London university had told them that the violence would undermine the campaign, and that it "could not have gone better for the government.

Several thousand protesters, most of whom were students or school children, gathered in [[Trafalgar Square]], central London, late in the morning. They proceeded toward Whitehall shouting the slogan, "fuck David Cameron".<ref name="Second day"/> Believing that there had been a lack of officers at 10 November demonstration, the Metropolitan Police drafted in 1000 police officers from across [[Greater London]] to oversee the event, almost five times the number at 10 November.{{cn|date=June 2020}} Police informed press that they planned to monitor fringe elements within the demonstration whom they believed planned to encourage "vandalism and violence".<ref name="Second day"/>

At Whitehall, just before 1&nbsp;pm, police prevented the protesters from reaching [[Parliament Square]] and the Houses of Parliament, setting up a line of riot police to kettle the protesters. A reporter ''The Guardian'' described the crowd at this point as being "predominantly good natured, although very noisy". Nonetheless, the demonstrators tried to push through the police line, leading to clashes. An unoccupied police van which had been left in the midst of the crowd was vandalised; protesters rocked it back and forth, climbed on its roof, smashed its windows, wrote [[graffiti]] on it and threw a [[smoke bomb]] inside.<ref name="students stage day of protests" /><ref name="Second day"/> A group of school girls encircled the van, urging people not to vandalise it.

During the Whitehall incident, the Metropolitan Police publicly defended their use of kettling, with Chief Inspector Jane Connors claiming that they had only used it as "a last resort". She stated: "it's a valid tactic. Police officers came under attack and we needed to make sure the violence didn't spread out across the London streets."<ref name="Second day"/> The police came under increasing criticism however, particularly as there were large numbers of children and young teenagers in the crowd, who were held for nearly ten hours in near-zero temperatures.<ref name="Second day"/><ref name="Battle lines"/> Green Party MP [[Caroline Lucas]] brought up the topic in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] that afternoon, stating: "there are many hundreds of students and school children who have been kettled for over four hours and are going to be out there for another several hours, according to the police, in the freezing cold… whatever one thinks of the student protest, [holding people against their will in the contained crowd was] neither proportionate, nor, indeed, effective."<ref name="Second day"/>

At a meeting of the Metropolitan Police Authority the following day, the Metropolitan Police's Commissioner [[Sir Paul Stephenson]] defended the tactics. He condemned the protest.

=== Catford protest ===
[[File:Cambridge University, Combination Room, 2010 student occupation.jpg|upright|thumb|Cambridge [[Old Schools]] Combination Room during an eleven-day occupation.]]

The night before, on 28 November, a crowd of two to three hundred protesters gathered outside of [[Lewisham]] Town Hall in [[Catford]], south London, where a council meeting was then in progress, to protest against wider public sector cuts.  Several Youtube videos of the incident were shown on national news, including the BBC. Many of the protesters had come from nearby sixth forms (due to potential [[Education Maintenance Allowance]] cuts) and also from [[Goldsmiths College]]. Demonstrators, playing music and political slogans from [[boombox]]es forced their way into the building, where a smoke bomb was let off, while another protester climbed onto the roof and unfurled a banner. Several more flares were set off outside and windows smashed, with riot police from the Territorial Support Group close by, were called and several arrests were made.<ref name="Lewisham" /><ref name="Rachel H">{{cite news | last = H | first = Rachel | title = Demonstrators Rush Lewisham Town Hall To Protest Against Cuts| work =Londonist | date = 30 November 2010| url = http://londonist.com/2010/11/demonstrators-rush-lewisham-town-hall-to-protest-against-cuts.php| accessdate =1 December 2010| location=London| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101214202727/http://londonist.com/2010/11/demonstrators-rush-lewisham-town-hall-to-protest-against-cuts.php| archivedate= 14 December 2010| url-status= live}}</ref><ref name="LewishamBBC" /> One of the protesters, Sue Luxton, a former Green Party councillor who had subsequently become a teacher, told the press that "I wanted to peacefully express my anger at the cuts...

On Thursday 9 December, the day of the scheduled vote on education reform in the Houses of Parliament, two separate protests were organised in central London; one led by the [[National Union of Students (United Kingdom)|National Union of Students]] (NUS), the other jointly by the University of London Union (ULU) and the NCAFC, with an expected 40,000 people attending.<ref name="Guardian: Student protests, as they happened">{{cite news | title = Student protests – as they happened|work=The Guardian |location=London | date = 9 December 2010| url = https://www.theguardian.com/education/blog/2010/dec/09/student-protests-live-coverage?INTCMP=SRCH| accessdate =12 December 2010| first1=Peter | last1=Walker | first2=Jonathan | last2=Paige}}</ref> ULU members handed out green [[hard hats]] with the words "Tax the banks, not the students" on them, whilst a rally was held in [[Bloomsbury]] at midday, where ULU President Solomon addressed the crowd.<ref name="Guardian: Student protests, as they happened" /> The Metropolitan Police had positioned lines of riot police and police vans along the Houses of Parliament, to prevent any protesters gaining access to it. Superintendent Julia Pendry issued a statement saying: "Protesters will be allowed sight and sound of parliament. However, there is evidence to suggest a number of people will come to London intent on causing violence and disorder. They are jumping on the bandwagon of these demonstrations with no intention to protest or interest in student tuition fees… those who are intent on committing crime will also be dealt with and they will suffer the consequences of their actions."<ref name="Guardian: Student protests, as they happened"/>

The protesters marched from Bloomsbury to Parliament Square in the afternoon, where they pushed down metal barriers and occupied the Square.<ref name="Guardian: Student protests, as they happened" /> Around 3:30&nbsp;pm, police kettled those several thousand protesters in the square, preventing them from leaving, stating that it was necessary "due to the level of violence that our officers are facing."<ref name="Guardian: Student protests, as they happened" /> Mounted police charged into the crowd on one side of the Square in an attempt to disperse them. A field hospital was set up on the green providing emergency first aid to protesters as well as tea and food within the containment area. Around 30 protesters were treated, most for head injuries.<ref name="Observer">{{cite news |last=Townsend |first=Mark |title=Kettle tactics risk Hillsborough-style tragedy – doctor |work=The Observer |location=London |date=19 December 2010|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/dec/19/police-kettle-risk-crush-hillsborough?INTCMP=SRCH |accessdate=15 December 2010}}</ref>

At 5:41&nbsp;pm, news reached the protesters that the government had voted to support the proposals. Clashes ensued between the crowd and the police, and the protesters pulled along metal fencing to separate themselves from riot police, who were trying to push them all into the centre of the Square.<ref name="Guardian: Student protests, as they happened" /> Later on in the evening, with the protesters still kettled in the Square, protesters smashed all of the windows on the ground floor of [[Her Majesty's Treasury]].<ref name="BBC: Heather Sharp, protesters">{{cite news | last =Sharp | first =Heather | title = Protesters mount their last stand as fees vote nears|work=BBC News | date = 9 December 2010| url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-11959950| accessdate =12 December 2010| location=London| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101210050236/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-11959950| archivedate= 10 December 2010| url-status= live}}</ref> At 21:15, the protest was forced onto Westminster Bridge where it was kettled until approximately 23:30.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

===Protests elsewhere in central London===

Due to the Parliament Square protest being kettled, many other demonstrators could not enter the Square and so disseminated across much of the rest of central London. Some were separately kettled around [[Cenotaph#The Cenotaph, London|The Cenotaph]], where Charlie Gilmour, the adopted son of [[Pink Floyd]] guitarist [[David Gilmour]] and a student at [[Girton College, Cambridge]], was pictured swinging from a [[Union Flag]] on the memorial; he later apologised, claiming that he "did not realise" it was the Cenotaph.<ref name="BBC: David Gilmour's son">{{cite news | title = Pink Floyd star David Gilmour's son climbed Cenotaph|work=BBC News | date = 10 December 2010| url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-11972814| accessdate =12 December 2010| location=London| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101216072927/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-11972814| archivedate= 16 December 2010| url-status= live}}</ref>

Meanwhile, many of those students who remained around the area of Trafalgar Square continued to protest, with about 150 holding a sit-in in the adjacent National Gallery, while others attempted to set fire to the [[Trafalgar Square Christmas tree]].<ref name="BBC: Royal car attacked">{{cite news | title = Royal car attacked in protest after MPs' fee rise vote|work=BBC News | date = 10 December 2010| url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-11954333| accessdate =12 December 2010| location=London| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101210045010/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-11954333| archivedate= 10 December 2010| url-status= live}}</ref>

=== Response ===
Home Secretary Theresa May issued a statement in which she "utterly condemned" the actions of the protesters, and declared that "What we are seeing in London tonight, the wanton vandalism, smashing of windows, has nothing to do with peaceful protest... Attacks on police officers and property show that some of the protesters have no respect for London or its citizens."<ref name="BBC: Royal car attacked"/>

Nearly 50 people complained to the [[Independent Police Complaints Commission|IPCC]] about police behaviour during the various protests held around the country, with the majority directed against the Metropolitan Police, including complaints of violence used against protesters.<ref>{{cite news|last=Sawer |first=Patrick |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/law-and-order/8196630/Police-dragged-me-from-wheelchair-twice-during-protests-says-demonstrator.html |title=Police dragged me from wheelchair twice during protests, says demonstrator |work=The Telegraph|date=12 December 2010|accessdate=23 December 2010|location=London| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101213073003/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/law-and-order/8196630/Police-dragged-me-from-wheelchair-twice-during-protests-says-demonstrator.html| archivedate= 13 December 2010| url-status= live}}</ref>

Street medics treated student protesters during the parliament square protest on Thursday 9 December, the day of the scheduled vote to raise university tuition fees. A field tent was set up on the green providing emergency first aid to protesters as well as tea and food within the containment area. Around 30 protesters were treated, most for head injuries.<ref name="Observer"/>

{{Expand section|date=February 2014}}
On 30 November, following the third main day of protesting, the [[Welsh Assembly]] announced that it would not permit an increase in fees for Welsh students. A reporter from the BBC noted that this meant that if the plans went through in England, "it would mean that an English student at a university in England could pay more than £17,000 more for a three-year degree than a Welsh student on the same course." .<ref name="Standoff BBC" />

A writer in British newspaper ''The Guardian'', writing several hours before the government vote on the topic, noted that "It seems likely the tuition fees bill will pass but I'd still argue that – whatever your view on the merits of the new fees system – the protests have been a success at least in calling politicians to account for broken pledges, something you see rarely theses [sic] days."<ref name="Guardian: Student protests, as they happened"/>

In July 2011, three school children will challenge the kettling of children at the 24 November 2010 protest. They will seek a Judicial Review in the High Court, arguing in particular that children had a right to protest and that their safety was jeopardised, breaking the laws of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]], the [[Convention on the Rights of the Child|United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child]] and the [[Children Act 2004]],<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-13679665 |title=Kettling of children at tuition fees protest challenged |publisher=BBC London |date= 7 June 2011|accessdate=10 June 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110607112625/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-13679665| archivedate= 7 June 2011| url-status= live}}</ref>

In November 2012, two years after the 2010 demonstrations, protests ignited again from the student movement. Organised by the NUS, around 10,000 demonstrators marched in central London.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-20412792 |title=Students march in London protest |date=21 November 2012|publisher=BBC News }}</ref>

After a five-day trial in the [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] in June 2012, 27-year-old assistant tutor Luke Cooper, reported to be completing a PhD in [[international relations]] at the [[University of Sussex]], was awarded £35,000 over a front page ''[[Evening Standard]]'' article and £25,000 over a follow-up piece in the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' that implied he was the "ringleader" of the protesters who invaded the Conservative Party's headquarters. Cooper complained that the allegations were untrue, threatened his future academic prospects and left his reputation "as badly trashed" as the [[Millbank Tower]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/feedarticle/10302854|title=Tutor wins damages after cuts march|work=The Guardian|location=London|date=23 June 2012|accessdate=23 June 2012}}</ref>

The years following the student protests saw a leftward shift in the politics of the NUS. In 2014 the NUS Conference voted in support of free education, reversing the union's previous policy of advocating a [[graduate tax]] as a replacement for tuition fees, which it had adopted in the late 2000s. The [[Student Broad Left]] made progressive gains in the mid-2010s, culminating in the election of SBL candidate [[Malia Bouattia]] as NUS President. Participants in the protests went on to be involved in a number of left-wing causes, such as the [[Trade unions in the United Kingdom|trade union movement]], the [[climate movement]], [[Palestinians|Palestinian]] and [[Kurds|Kurdish]] solidarity, [[Alternative media in the United Kingdom|alternative media]] (such as Aaron Bastani, co-founder of [[Novara Media]]), migrant and refugee solidarity campaigns, and [[Momentum (organisation)|Momentum]] and the Labour Party under the leadership of [[Jeremy Corbyn]] (such as [[James Schneider]], who served as Corbyn's head of strategic communications).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.plutobooks.com/blog/2010-uk-student-movement-research-project/ |title=2010 and the UK Student Movement Research Project |last=Hudson |first=Carlus  |website=[[Pluto Books]] |access-date=17 November 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://tribunemag.co.uk/2020/11/the-millbank-revolt-10-years-on |title=The Millbank Revolt, 10 Years On |last=Myers |first=Matt |date=10 November 2020 |website=[[Tribune (magazine)]] |access-date=17 November 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.jacobinmag.com/2018/01/student-revolt-austerity-uk-corbyn-momentum |title=The Corbyn Generation |last=Earle |first=Samuel |date=19 January 2018 |website=[[Jacobin (magazine)]] |access-date=17 November 2020}}</ref>
