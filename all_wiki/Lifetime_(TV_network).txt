===Cable Health Network===
[[Lifetime Entertainment Services#Cable Health Network|Cable Health Network]] was launched as a full-time channel in June 1982 with a range of health-related programming. In November 1983, Cable Health Network adopted a new name, Lifetime Medical Television.<ref name=idc/>

==History==
===Hearst/ABC-Viacom Entertainment Services===
Lifetime was established on February 1, 1984 as the result of a merger of Hearst/ABC's Daytime and [[Viacom (original)|Viacom]]'s Lifetime Medical Television.<ref name="nyt"/><ref name=idc/>  A board for the new network was formed with equal representation from Hearst, ABC, and Viacom, and the board elected Thomas Burchill as the new network's first CEO.<ref name=":4">Meehan, Eileen and Jackie Byars. "Telefeminism: How Lifetime Got Its Groove: 1984–1997." [https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Television_Studies_Reader.html?id=pf5QEQkbePsC The Television Studies Reader]. [[Psychology Press]], 2004.</ref> It was not an initial success, reportedly losing $36 million in its first two years of operation, and did not become profitable until 1986.<ref name=":1">Hammer, Joshua. "Programmer Revives Lifetime Cable Channel" [https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=sLUeAAAAIBAJ&sjid=0M4EAAAAIBAJ&pg=1722%2C3422359 (Page 1)], [https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=sLUeAAAAIBAJ&sjid=0M4EAAAAIBAJ&pg=2229%2C3446794 (Page 2)], ''[[Spartanburg Herald-Journal]]'' (South Carolina), July 13, 1991. Retrieved July 7, 2013.</ref> The channel suffered from low viewership, with a poll reportedly finding that some TV viewers erroneously believed it carried religious content.<ref name=":1" />

In 1985, Lifetime started branding itself as "Talk Television" with a nightly lineup of talk shows and call-in programs hosted by people including [[Regis Philbin]] and [[Dr. Ruth Westheimer]]. In the process, the creators dropped the apple from the logo.

In 1988, Lifetime hired Patricia Fili as its head of programming. In the first three years of her tenure, she changed 60 percent of Lifetime's programming, by her own estimate.<ref name=":1" /> In addition to overhauling Lifetime's signature talk show, ''[[Attitudes (TV series)|Attitudes]]'', by hiring a new producer and refocusing it on current women's issues, Fili acquired the rights to syndicated network hits like ''[[Moonlighting (TV series)|Moonlighting]]'' and ''[[L.A. Law]]''. She also oversaw the production of the first Lifetime movies ever made, along with carrying the final three seasons of the [[Blair Brown]]–starring [[dramedy]] ''[[The Days and Nights of Molly Dodd]]'' from [[NBC]] after the network canceled it. The network also showed movies from the portfolios of its owners, Hearst, ABC, and Viacom.<ref name=":4" /> In 1991, reporter Joshua Hammer stated, "Considered one of cable TV's backwaters, [...] Lifetime network was replete with annoying gabfests for housewives and recycled, long-forgotten network television series, such as ''[[Partners in Crime (U.S. TV series)|Partners in Crime]]'' and ''[[MacGruder and Loud]]''. [...] Under Fili's direction, Lifetime has gone a long way toward shedding its low-rent image."<ref name=":1" />

Lifetime began airing a limited amount of women's sports coverage, including the [[WNBA]] and the [[America's Cup]], in which it sponsored the first women's crew team to compete. McCormick also strengthened the network's ties with women's organizations such as the [[National Organization for Women]], and began airing [[public service announcement]]s about women's issues, such as [[breast cancer]] awareness. Lifetime also adopted a new tagline. "Lifetime – Television for Women."<ref name=":4" />

Meanwhile, the channel's original programming was aimed not just at women aged 24–44, but these women's spouses, who research showed watched the network in the evenings with their wives. This was done by making the male characters in Lifetime's original programming – such as the film series ''[[Spencer for Hire]]'' – more appealing to men by making them more masculine. These roles were more stereotypical than previous Lifetime movies, which usually featured women protagonists on their own. This helped Lifetime take advantage of a known bias in the [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen ranking system]] that favored "upscale" couples who shared a television set. By January 1995, Lifetime was the sixth most-highly rated subscription network by Nielsen.<ref name=":4" />

===Lifetime Entertainment Services===
In 1996, [[Tele-Communications Inc.|TCI]], one of the United States' largest subscription providers, announced that it would no longer carry Lifetime in certain markets to make room for the soon-to-be-launched [[Fox News Channel]], in which TCI held a financial stake.<ref name=":10">Carter, Bill. [https://www.nytimes.com/1996/09/14/business/plan-to-cut-tv-channel-angers-women-s-groups.html "Plan to Cut TV Channel Angers Women's Groups]." ''The New York Times'', September 14, 1996. Retrieved July 7, 2013.</ref> According to Lifetime executives, the network stood to lose up to one million subscribers due to TCI's move.<ref name=":10" /> However, Lifetime published advertisements in some of the markets that would be affected – including [[Eugene, Oregon]] and [[Newport, Rhode Island]] – informing customers that TCI was removing the only network that was made for women.<ref name=":4" /> After TCI customers called the company to complain, TCI cut back the number of homes that would lose Lifetime to approximately 300,000. Still, women's groups and politicians rallied behind Lifetime.<ref name=":10" /> Colorado representative [[Patricia Schroeder]] called TCI's decision a "power play" between TCI chief executive [[John Malone]] and Fox executive [[Rupert Murdoch]], and said, "Women kind of feel like they're being rolled over so that the guys who run these companies can make more money."<ref name=":10" />

Massachusetts Congressman [[Barney Frank]] said that the decision showed that Fox "might have an agenda of its own that is anti-woman."<ref name=":10" /> TCI executives were surprised and angry about the public's reaction. TCI's vice president of programming was quoted in ''[[The New York Times]]'' as saying, "I resent the implication that they are the women's network. Other networks come in to us and say Lifetime is not telling the truth. Lifetime is a women's channel only in name and advertising. [...] It programs for ratings." TCI senior vice president Robert Thomson stated that the reaction was "laughably out of scale," based on the fact that less than 10 percent of Lifetime's audience would be affected. TCI executives chalked the politicians' reactions up to lobbying by Lifetime and it being an election year, and suggested to the ''Times'' that in retaliation, Disney (one of Lifetime's parent companies), may have trouble launching a new network on TCI.<ref name=":10" /> In 1997, it was reported that Lifetime had 67.7 million subscribers.<ref name=":7">Winfrey, Lee.

In the past, Lifetime used to air several game shows in [[daytime television|daytime]] and early evenings, including ''[[Supermarket Sweep]]'', ''[[Shop 'til You Drop]]'', ''[[Rodeo Drive (game show)|Rodeo Drive]]'', ''[[Born Lucky]]'', and ''[[Debt (game show)|Debt]]''. Lifetime also produced one original game show (''Who Knows You Best?'', starring Gina St. John), with a format based on ''[[The Newlywed Game]]''; it was canceled after one season. The network has also previously produced scripted dramas, such as ''[[Devious Maids]]'' and ''[[Witches of East End (TV series)|Witches of East End]]''.

The network currently airs a mix of second-run syndicated series (such as ''[[How I Met Your Mother]]'' and ''[[Grey's Anatomy]]'') during the daytime hours.  In the past, Lifetime has revived several programs that originally aired on other networks. In 1988, it bought the rights to the existing 26 episodes of ''[[The Days and Nights of Molly Dodd]]'' from its original broadcaster [[NBC]], and produced 39 additional episodes of the series. Lifetime did not renew the show reportedly because of low ratings and the high cost to produce the program.<ref name=":1" /> In late 2011, the network began to air new episodes of ''[[America's Most Wanted]]'', a program canceled in series form by [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] at the end of the 2010–11 season,<ref name=":3">Goldberg, Lesley.

'''LRW''' ('''Lifetime Real Women''') is an American [[pay television]] channel which is intended as a complementary service to the main Lifetime network. It was launched in August 2001, mainly as a response to Lifetime's challenges from the then-launching [[WE tv]] and [[Oxygen (TV channel)|Oxygen]] networks for the women's network market.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/television/2001-04-11-lifetime-real-women.htm|title=Lifetime adds 'Real Women' to its networks|last=Levin|first=Gary|date=11 April 2001|work=[[USA Today]]|accessdate=8 January 2014}}</ref> LRW is available in over 10 million homes via [[Verizon FiOS]], and [[AT&T U-verse]]. The network has a mixture of comedies, dramas, how-to, game shows and reality programming that had once aired or is currently airing on the main Lifetime network, and formerly imported series with rights held by Lifetime but no carriage due to the main network's current format. LRW also features no original series or films, deferring from Lifetime and LMN, though it did [[burning off|burn off]] the 2011 Lifetime reality series ''Love Handles: Couples in Crisis'', which only aired twice on the main network.

DirecTV carried the network until July 2007. Currently the network is available on satellite through OrbyTV.<ref>{{cite web|title=Channel Lineup|url=https://orbytv.com/channel-lineup/|website=Orby TV|accessdate=29 July 2019|date=July 2019}}</ref>

Cable carriage has declined as providers choose instead to carry high definition networks rather than standard definition-only channels such as LRW without original programming.

==Lifetime Movie Club==
On July 2, 2015, Lifetime launched a streaming service branded as Lifetime Movie Club (LMC). The service offers over 2,000 titles, both originally-produced & acquired by Lifetime.
