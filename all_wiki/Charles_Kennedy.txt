'''Charles Peter Kennedy''' (25 November 1959 – 1 June 2015) was a British [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]] politician who was [[Leader of the Liberal Democrats]] from 1999 to 2006, and a [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] (MP) from [[1983 United Kingdom general election|1983]] to [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015]].

Kennedy was elected to the [[House of Commons]] in [[1983 United Kingdom general election|1983]], and after the [[SDP–Liberal Alliance|Alliance]] parties merged, became [[President of the Liberal Democrats]] and, following the resignation of [[Paddy Ashdown]], [[Leader of the Liberal Democrats]]. He led the party through two general elections, increasing its number of seats in the House of Commons to their highest level since 1923, and led his party's [[opposition to the Iraq War]]. A charismatic and affable speaker in public, he appeared extensively on television during his leadership.

During the latter stages of Kennedy's leadership, there was concern about both his leadership and his health. From December 2005, some within the party were openly questioning his position and calling for a leadership election. On 5 January 2006, he was informed that [[ITN]] would be reporting that he had received treatment for [[alcoholism]]; he pre-empted the broadcast by admitting that he had had treatment, and resigned as leader the following day. After [[Menzies Campbell]] succeeded him as leader, Kennedy remained in office as a backbench MP, where he voted against the formation of the [[Cameron–Clegg coalition]]. He died less than a month after being unseated from the House of Commons in [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015]].

Kennedy moved into frontbench politics in 1989, becoming the party's spokesperson for Health. After retaining his seat in the [[1992 United Kingdom general election|1992 general election]] he served as the spokesperson for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs during the 1992–97 parliament. He retained his seat in the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997 general election]] and served on the Standards and Privileges select committee from 1997 to 1999.<ref name="UKParliament" />

He was [[President of the Liberal Democrats|Liberal Democrat Party President]] from 1990 to 1994, and Liberal Democrat spokesperson for the office of the Leader of the House of Commons from 1997 to 1999.<ref name="UKParliament" />

== Leader of the Liberal Democrats ==
Kennedy was elected leader of the Liberal Democrats on 9 August 1999, after the retirement of [[Paddy Ashdown]]. He won 57% of the transferred vote under the [[Instant-runoff voting|Alternative Vote]] system, beating the runner-up [[Simon Hughes]] (43% of the transferred vote), [[Malcolm Bruce]], [[Jackie Ballard]] and [[David Rendel]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Charles Kennedy elected leader of Lib Dems |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1999/aug/09/libdemleadership.liberaldemocrats1 |website=the Guardian |language=en |date=9 August 1999}}</ref> In October of the same year he was sworn in as a Member of the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Charles Kennedy: 'I'm like a football manager.

Kennedy's style of leadership was regarded as "conversational and companionable".<ref>{{cite web |last1=Taylor |first1=Brian |title=Charles Kennedy: A political contact and a chum |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-32980640 |website=BBC News |date=2 June 2015}}</ref> He was labelled "Chatshow Charlie" by some observers as a result of his appearances on the [[Satire|satirical]] [[panel game]] ''[[Have I Got News for You]]''.<ref>{{cite web |title=Lib Dem chief defends TV quiz |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/2555987.stm |website=BBC NEWS |date=8 December 2002}}</ref>

In Kennedy's first campaign as Leader, the [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001 general election]], the Liberal Democrats won 52 seats with an 18.3% share of the vote; this was a 1.5% improvement in vote share (and an improvement of six seats) over the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997 election]], but smaller than the 25.4% vote share the SDP/Liberal Alliance had achieved in 1983, which won it 23 seats.<ref name="bbc.com"/> Kennedy led his party's opposition to the [[Iraq War]], with all Liberal Democrats voting against or abstaining in the vote for the invasion of Iraq—the largest British party to do so.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/commentators/john-whitelegg-the-myth-of-mr-kennedys-opposition-to-the-war-730741.html|title=John Whitelegg: The myth of Mr Kennedy's opposition to the war|last=Whitelegg|first=John|date=2 June 2004|website=[[The Independent]]|accessdate=2 October 2019}}</ref>

In April 2005, the launch of his party's manifesto for the [[2005 United Kingdom general election|2005 general election]] was delayed because of the birth of his first child, with [[Menzies Campbell]] taking temporary charge as acting leader and covering Kennedy's campaign duties. At the manifesto launch, on his first day back on the campaign trail after the birth, Kennedy struggled to remember the details of a key policy (replacing the [[Council Tax]] with a local [[income tax]]) at an early morning press conference, which he later blamed on a lack of sleep due to his new child.<ref>{{cite news|title=Profile: Charles Kennedy|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4527622.stm|accessdate=2 June 2015|date=7 January 2006|work=BBC News|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202134855/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4527622.stm|archive-date=2 December 2008|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Sawer|first1=Patrick|title=Funeral absence hinted at Charles Kennedy marriage split|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/liberaldemocrats/7946193/Funeral-absence-hinted-at-Charles-Kennedy-marriage-split.html|accessdate=1 June 2015|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=14 August 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150602063443/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/liberaldemocrats/7946193/Funeral-absence-hinted-at-Charles-Kennedy-marriage-split.html|archive-date=2 June 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>

[[File:Charles Peter Kennedy.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Kennedy during the [[2005 United Kingdom general election|2005 election]] campaign]]In his last general election as leader, in May 2005, he extended his strategy from the 2001 election of targeting the seats held by the most senior and/or highly regarded Conservative MPs, dubbed a "decapitation" strategy.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/libdems/page/0,,1049679,00.html |title=The 'Decapitators' |work=The Guardian |access-date=2 June 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150602194434/http://www.theguardian.com/politics/libdems/page/0%2C%2C1049679%2C00.html |archive-date= 2 June 2015 |url-status=live |date=September 2003 }}</ref> The Liberal Democrats also hoped to capture marginal [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] seats, attracting (particularly [[Islam in the United Kingdom|Muslim]]) Labour voters who were dissatisfied because of the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|invasion of Iraq]], which Kennedy's party had opposed.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Branigan |first1=Tania |last2=correspondent |first2=political |title=Lib Dems ready to play the anti-war card |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2005/apr/22/uk.iraq1 |website=The Guardian |date=22 April 2005}}</ref>

Just before the election, it had been anticipated by the media and opinion polls that the Liberal Democrats could win up to 100 seats and place themselves close to the Conservatives in terms of seats as well as votes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.epolitix.com/latestnews/article-detail/newsarticle/top-ten-lib-dem-breakthrough-moments/ |title=Top Ten: Lib Dem 'breakthrough moments' |publisher=ePolitix.com |date=24 April 2010 |accessdate=9 December 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100512171830/http://www.epolitix.com/latestnews/article-detail/newsarticle/top-ten-lib-dem-breakthrough-moments/ |archive-date=12 May 2010}}</ref> They won 62 seats and 22.1% of the vote,<ref>{{cite web |title=2005 Results |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/vote_2005/constituencies/default.stm |website=news.bbc.co.uk}}</ref> their greatest number of seats since their Liberal Party predecessor won 158 seats in [[1923 United Kingdom general election|1923]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.independent.ie/world-news/europe/former-leading-british-politician-charles-kennedy-found-dead-31271429.html |title=Former leading British politician Charles Kennedy found dead |work=[[Irish Independent]] |accessdate=2 June 2015 |date=2 June 2015}}</ref>

Kennedy heralded the Liberal Democrats, who now had a total of 62 seats, as the "national party of the future",<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/vote_2005/frontpage/4518803.stm |work=BBC News |title=Kennedy hails 'party of future' |date=6 May 2005 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150521222536/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/vote_2005/frontpage/4518803.stm |archive-date=21 May 2015 |url-status=live |access-date=2 June 2015}}</ref> but in the wake of the general election, Kennedy's leadership came under increased criticism from those who felt that the Liberal Democrats could have surged forward, with the official opposition Conservative Party having been relatively weak. Many pointed the finger of blame at Kennedy for failing to widen the party's appeal. Others, like the former Deputy Chairman of the Federal Liberal Democrat Party, Donnachadh McCarthy, resigned, citing the party's shift to the right of the political spectrum under Kennedy in pursuit of Conservative votes.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/commentators/donnachad-mccarthy-the-shameful-truth-behind-the-lib-dems-demise-402608.html |title=The shameful truth behind the Lib Dems' demise |work=The Independent |date=17 September 2007 |accessdate=2 June 2015 |first=Donnachad |last=McCarthy |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150602170947/http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/commentators/donnachad-mccarthy-the-shameful-truth-behind-the-lib-dems-demise-402608.html |archive-date=2 June 2015 |url-status=live}}</ref>

=== Leadership concerns ===
After the election of [[David Cameron]] as Leader of the Conservative Party in December 2005, it was widely reported that senior members of the Liberal Democrats had told Kennedy that he must either "raise his game" or resign.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4525442.stm |title=Anti-Kennedy briefings 'cowardly'|date=14 December 2005 |work=BBC News |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060221132528/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4525442.stm |archive-date=21 February 2006 |url-status=live |access-date=2 June 2015}}</ref> Speculation surrounding the leadership of the Liberal Democrats was widespread in late 2005, with the journalist [[Andrew Neil]] claiming to speak "on good authority" that Kennedy would announce his resignation at the 2006 spring conference of the Liberal Democrats.

=== Resignation ===
[[File:Charles Kennedy, October 2007.jpg|thumb|250px|Kennedy in October 2007.]]
On 6 January 2006, Kennedy was informed that [[ITN]] would be reporting that he had received treatment for a drinking problem. He decided to pre-empt the broadcast, called a sudden news conference, and made a personal statement that over the past eighteen months he had been coming to terms with a drinking problem, but had sought professional help. He told reporters that recent questions among his colleagues about his suitability as leader were partly as a result of the drinking problem but stated that he had been dry for the past two months and would be calling a leadership contest, in which he would stand, to resolve the issues surrounding his authority once and for all.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4582930.stm |title=Kennedy admits battling alcohol |date=5 January 2006 |work=BBC News |access-date=2 June 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080726223634/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4582930.stm |archive-date=26 July 2008 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.libdems.org.uk/news/kennedy-calls-for-leadership-election.html |title=Kennedy calls for leadership election |date=5 January 2006 |website=[[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060516033026/http://www.libdems.org.uk/news/kennedy-calls-for-leadership-election.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=16 May 2006}}</ref> It was later claimed that the source for ITN's story was his former press secretary turned [[ITV News]] correspondent, [[Daisy McAndrew]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://scotlandonsunday.scotsman.com/comment/How-Chatshow-Charlie-was-left.2740419.jp|title=How Chatshow Charlie was left high and dry|date=8 January 2006 |work=[[The Scotsman]]|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131013124611/http://www.scotsman.com/news/how-chatshow-charlie-was-left-high-and-dry-1-1406995|archive-date=13 October 2013|access-date=2 June 2015}}</ref>

On 7 January 2006, Kennedy called another press conference, at which he announced that while he was buoyed by the supportive messages he had received from grass root members, he felt that he could not continue as leader because of the lack of confidence from the parliamentary party. He said he would not be a candidate in the leadership election and was standing down as leader "with immediate effect", with [[Menzies Campbell]] to act as interim leader until a new leader was elected.<ref>{{cite web |last1=King |first1=Oliver |title=Kennedy resigns |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2006/jan/07/liberaldemocrats.politics1 |website=The Guardian |date=7 January 2006}}</ref> He also confirmed in his resignation statement that he did not expect to remain on the [[Liberal Democrat Frontbench Team]]. He pledged his loyalty to a new leader as a [[backbencher]], and said he wished to remain active in the party and in politics. Campbell went on to win the resulting [[2006 Liberal Democrats leadership election|leadership election]], and Kennedy subsequently gave his successor full public support.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/4768088.stm |title=Support for new Lib Dems leader |date=2 March 2006 |work=BBC News |access-date=2 June 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060531213007/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/4768088.stm |url-status=live |archive-date=31 May 2006}}</ref> His leadership had lasted slightly less than six years and five months.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4590688.stm |title=Embattled Kennedy quits as leader |date=7 January 2006 |work=BBC News |access-date=2 June 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061219123040/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4590688.stm |archive-date=19 December 2006 |url-status=live}}</ref>

== Later political career ==

=== Backbencher ===
[[File:Charles kennedy feb 2009.jpg|thumb|200px|Charles Kennedy attending a debate at the [[Glasgow University Union]] on 10 February 2009]]
After resigning as party leader, Kennedy remained in office as a backbench MP. His first major political activity was to campaign in the [[2006 Dunfermline and West Fife by-election|Dunfermline and West Fife by-election]], which the Liberal Democrats went on to win, taking the seat from Labour.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/4671042.stm |title=Kennedy joins by-election drive |date=2 February 2006 |work=BBC News |access-date=2 June 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060212161016/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/4671042.stm |archive-date=12 February 2006 |url-status=live}}</ref>

On 22 June 2006, Kennedy made his first appearance in the national media after stepping down as party leader when he appeared on the BBC's ''[[Question Time (TV programme)|Question Time]]''. One of the questions on the show was about his possible return as leader, which he declined to rule out.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/5108254.stm |title=Kennedy not ruling out his return |date=22 June 2006 |work=BBC News |access-date=2 June 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060925100041/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/5108254.stm |archive-date=25 September 2006 |url-status=live}}</ref>

On 4 August 2006, he hosted a documentary on [[Channel 4]] about what he saw as the increasing disenchantment felt by voters towards the main parties in British politics because of their hesitation to discuss the big issues, especially at election time, and the ruthless targeting of swing-voters in key constituencies at the expense of the majority. He also contributed an article covering the same issues to ''The Guardian''{{'}}s Comment Is Free section.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/story/0,,1837015,00.html|title=How we lost people's trust|date=4 August 2006|first=Charles|last=Kennedy|access-date=2 June 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150528073656/http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2006/aug/04/comment.politics|archive-date=28 May 2015|url-status=live|work=The Guardian}}</ref>

After Campbell resigned as Liberal Democrat leader on 15 October 2007, Kennedy said that it was "highly unlikely" that he would try to return as party leader, but he did not rule it out completely.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/7048748.stm |title=Kennedy 'unlikely to run again' |date=17 October 2007 |work=BBC News |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071019015642/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7048748.stm |archive-date=19 October 2007 |url-status=live |access-date=2 June 2015}}</ref>

=== Conservative–Liberal Democrat coalition (2010–2015) ===
At the [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010 general election]], Kennedy was re-elected to parliament with a majority of 13,070.<ref name="UKParliament" /><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/constituency/1256/ross-skye-and-lochaber |title=Ross, Skye and Lochaber – Constituency profile |work=The Guardian |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141104032840/http://www.theguardian.com/politics/constituency/1256/ross-skye-and-lochaber |archive-date=4 November 2014 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

Kennedy voted against the [[2010 United Kingdom government formation|Conservative–Liberal Democrat coalition]] in May 2010,<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/jun/02/charles-kennedy-made-two-momentous-stands-that-resonate-to-this-day |title=Charles Kennedy made two momentous stands that resonate to this day |last=Watt |first=Nicholas |date=2 June 2015 |work=[[The Guardian]] |access-date=2 June 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150602161923/http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/jun/02/charles-kennedy-made-two-momentous-stands-that-resonate-to-this-day |archive-date=2 June 2015 |url-status=live}}</ref> explaining in an article for ''The Observer'' that he "did not subscribe to the view that remaining in opposition ourselves, while extending responsible '[[Confidence and supply]]' requirements to a minority Conservative administration, was tantamount to a 'do nothing' response". Finally, Kennedy warned of the risks of "a subsequent assimilation within the Conservative fold", adding: "[[David Cameron]] has been here often before: from the early days of his leadership he was happy to describe himself as a '[[Liberal conservatism|liberal Conservative]]'. And we know he dislikes the term Tory. These ongoing efforts at appropriation are going to have to be watched".<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/may/16/charles-kennedy-coalition-views |title=Why I couldn't support Clegg's deal with the Tories |date=16 May 2010 |work=[[The Observer]] |last=Kennedy |first=Charles |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120209215915/http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2010/may/16/charles-kennedy-coalition-views |archive-date=9 February 2012 |url-status=live |access-date=2 June 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Charles Kennedy to be European Movement President |newspaper=Euromove |pages=1–2 |date=Autumn 2007}}</ref>
