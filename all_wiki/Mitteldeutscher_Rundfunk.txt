== History ==
===Origins===
[[Image:MIRAG-Logo 1924.svg|thumb|right|MIRAG Logo (1924)]]
The Mitteldeutsche Rundfunk AG (MIRAG) was founded on 22 January 1924 in [[Leipzig]]. It aired its first program on 1 March 1924 at 14:30 CET.<ref name="mirag">{{cite web |url=https://www.mdr.de/unternehmen/organisation/20jahremdr/artikel43044_zc-fc69a5f4_zs-2e055184.html|title=Mit der Mirag fing es an |publisher=Mitteldeutscher Rundfunk |language=German |date=29 May 2011|accessdate=15 May 2020}}</ref>

During the ''[[Gleichschaltung]]'' in the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] era, the MIRAG was transferred to the "Reichssender Leipzig" in 1934.<ref name="reichssender">{{cite web |url=https://www.mdr.de/unternehmen/artikel76572.html|title=70 Jahre Rundfunk in Leipzig |publisher=Mitteldeutscher Rundfunk |language=German |date=31 January 2007|accessdate=15 May 2020}}</ref>

After the end of the Second World War, the [[Soviet Military Administration in Germany]] temporarily licensed "Radio Leipzig" in 1945, which only existed for a few months until the Mitteldeutscher Rundfunk was founded again. In 1946 the new program "Mitteldeutscher Rundfunk, Sender Leipzig" started in the Springerstrasse broadcasting house.

In September 1952, the "Sender Leipzig" program was converted to the "Berlin III" entertainment program. In 1956 the regional program of Radio DDR (English: Radio [[East Germany|GDR]]), "Sender Leipzig", was introduced.
