'''Belinda Bencic''' ({{lang-sk|Belinda Benčičová}}, {{IPA-sk|ˈbɛlinda ˈbɛntʃitʃɔʋaː|pron}}; born 10 March 1997)<ref name=aktuality>{{cite web|url=http://sport.aktuality.sk/c/168449/belinda-bencicova-svajciarka-hrda-na-svoj-slovensky-povod|title=Belinda Benčičová, Švajčiarka hrdá na svoj slovenský pôvod|date=29 May 2014|website = sport.sk |language=Slovak}}</ref> is a Swiss professional [[tennis]] player. She has a career-high [[Women's Tennis Association]] (WTA) ranking of No. 4 in the world which she reached in February 2020. Bencic has won four singles and two doubles titles on the WTA Tour.

Born in Switzerland to Slovak parents at a time when Slovak-Swiss player [[Martina Hingis]] was one of the best tennis players in the world, Bencic began playing tennis at the age of two. Her father arranged for her to train with Hingis's mother and coach Melanie Molitor daily from the age of seven. By the time she was 16, Bencic became the No. 1 ranked junior in the world and won two junior Grand Slam singles titles at the [[2013 French Open|French Open]] and [[2013 Wimbledon Championships|Wimbledon]]. On the professional tour, she made her top 100 debut shortly after turning 17. Her first big breakthrough came at the [[2014 US Open (tennis)|2014 US Open]], where she became the youngest quarterfinalist since Hingis in 1997. Bencic won her first two WTA titles in 2015, including the [[2015 Rogers Cup|Canadian Open]] where she defeated four of the top six players in the world. She then made her top 10 debut the following year while still 18 years old.

From 2016 through 2018, Bencic struggled with a variety of injury issues, most notably needing to have wrist surgery in 2017 that kept her out for five months and saw her ranking drop outside the top 300. Nonetheless, she rebounded quickly and rose back into the top 50 within a year of her comeback. She then posted her best season to date in 2019, winning her second Premier 5 title at the [[2019 Dubai Tennis Championships|Dubai Tennis Championships]] reaching her first Grand Slam semifinal at the [[2019 US Open (tennis)|US Open]], qualifying for her first [[2019 WTA Finals|WTA Finals]] where she reached the semifinals, and finishing the year inside the top 10 for the first time, which helped her win the [[WTA Comeback Player of the Year]] award.

==Early life and background==
Bencic was born on 10 March 1997 in [[Flawil]] in northeastern Switzerland to Dana and Ivan Benčič. Her parents were both born in [[Czechoslovakia]], but her father's family emigrated to Switzerland in 1968 to flee the [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia|Warsaw Pact invasion]] by the Soviet Union.<ref name="nyt-lob">{{cite web |last1=Clarey |first1=Christopher |title=Belinda Bencic Is a Phenom Who Loves to Lob |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/23/sports/tennis/precocious-belinda-bencic-is-a-phenom-who-loves-to-lob-australian-open.html |website=New York Times |accessdate=19 May 2019}}</ref> Her father was a professional hockey player in the Swiss [[National League (ice hockey)|National League A]] and [[Swiss League|National League B]] before becoming an insurance broker.<ref>{{cite web |title=Ivan Bencic |url=https://www.eliteprospects.com/player/200087/ivan-bencic |website=Elite Prospects |accessdate=19 May 2019}}</ref> Her mother was a high-level [[team handball|handball]] player.<ref name=wunderkind/> Bencic hit her first tennis balls at the age of two and began training with her father, who was also a recreational tennis player, for one hour per day at the age of four.<ref name=wunderkind>{{cite web | url=http://www.tagesanzeiger.ch/sport/tennis/Ein-Wunderkind-wird-erwachsen/story/10783218 | title=Ein "Wunderkind" wird erwachsen | first=René | last=Stauffer | work=[[Tages-Anzeiger]] | date=4 May 2012 | accessdate=13 January 2014 | language=German}}</ref><ref name="nyt-lob"/> She entered her first national tournament at that age, losing to an opponent six years older in straight sets without winning a game. Bencic would regularly face much older opponents as a child and was encouraged by her father to try to win two games per set.<ref name=si-2014>{{cite web |title=Get to know the youngest player left in the U.S. Open, 17-year-old Bencic |url=https://www.si.com/tennis/2014/08/30/belinda-bencic-qa-us-open |website=Sports Illustrated |accessdate=19 May 2019 |last = Nguyen | first = Courtney}}</ref>

When Bencic was five years old, her father contacted fellow Czechoslovak immigrant Melanie Molitor, the mother and coach of world No. 1 Swiss tennis player [[Martina Hingis]], for coaching advice.<ref name="nyt-lob"/> Hingis becoming the top player in the world around the time Bencic was born was also one reason her father was inspired to introduce her to the sport of tennis.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.nzz.ch/aktuell/sport/tennis/familienangelegenheit-1.18109786 | title=Familienangelegenheit |  first=Daniel| last=Germann | work=[[Neue Zürcher Zeitung]] | date=3 July 2013 | accessdate=13 January 2014 | language=German}}</ref> Molitor agreed to gauge Bencic's abilities, which led to Bencic working with Molitor once a week for about a year.<ref name="Pluska">{{cite web  |url=http://www.pluska.sk/sport/tenis/otec-vitazky-juniorky-parizi-belindy-bencicovej-doma-hovorime-po-slovensky.html | title=Otec víťazky juniorky v Paríži Belindy Bencicovej: Doma hovoríme po slovensky! | first=Leonard | last=Popovič | work=Pluska | date=17 June 2013 | accessdate=7 April 2014 | language=Slovak}}</ref> At the age of six, Bencic also spent six months at [[Nick Bollettieri]]'s academy in Florida in the United States, winning several under-10 tournaments.<ref name=wunderkind/> Around this time, her father also asked [[Marcel Niederer]], a childhood friend and fellow hockey player who had become an entrepreneur, if he could help sponsor his daughter's career. Niederer agreed to invest in Bencic, which gave her father the ability to quit his job so he could spend more time traveling with and coaching his daughter while she competed at tournaments.<ref name=nyt-lob/> In 2004 when Bencic was seven years old, her family moved to [[Wollerau]], where Molitor had just opened up her own academy, so that she could train there every day.<ref>{{cite web |title=Interview with Belinda Bencic:"I’m having a great summer" |url=https://www.sportskeeda.com/tennis/interview-with-belinda-bencicim-having-a-great-summer |website=Sports Keeda |accessdate=19 May 2019 | first = Anand|  last = Datla}}</ref> She continued to work with Molitor through her teenage years, and has also occasionally worked with Hingis.<ref name="nyt-lob"/>

[[File:Bencic MA14 (1) (14403183076).jpg|thumb|Bencic serving]]
Bencic is regularly compared to former world No. 1 Martina Hingis, as both players are Swiss, of Slovak descent, and have been coached by Hingis's mother. Hingis has compared herself with Bencic, saying, "The technique, my mom puts a lot of attention to that. So the game, I mean, [Bencic has] got a great backhand as well. But also she’s stronger, so she can work with other weapons than I had. I mean, maybe I was more maybe a little better mover, but when she hits a shot it can be a winner. Like she’s hitting a lot more winners than did I. So it’s different a little bit."<ref name="nyt-line">{{cite web |last1=Rothenberg |first1=Ben |title=Latest in Line of Elite Swiss Players: A 17-Year-Old With Ties to Hingis |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/31/sports/tennis/belinda-bencic-continuing-her-rise-at-us-open.html |website=New York Times |accessdate=20 May 2019}}</ref> Bencic excels at hitting the ball early or on the rise. Tennis coach [[Günter Bresnik]] has called her an "unbelievably smart player” and noted that, “She understands the game really well and knows exactly how to throw the other player off." Bencic possesses the ability to hit powerful [[groundstroke]] winners, but prefers to hit lob winners when presented with both options.<ref name=nyt-lob/> When playing with Roger Federer at the Hopman Cup, he praised her prowess at returning serve.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Rothenberg |first1=Ben |title=Filling a Weak Spot in Women’s Tennis: The Serve |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/03/sports/tennis/us-open-wta-tour-serving.html |website=New York Times |accessdate=20 May 2019}}</ref> Bencic is capable of turning defense into offense and excels at redirecting cross-court shots down the line.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Alberto |first1=Noel |title=WTA Indian Wells second round preview: Belinda Bencic vs Jelena Ostapenko |url=https://www.vavel.com/en-us/tennis-usa/2018/03/08/888971-wta-indian-wells-second-round-preview-belinda-bencic-vs-jelena-ostapenko.html |website=Vavel |accessdate=20 May 2019}}</ref>
