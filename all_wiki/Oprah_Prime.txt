==Background==
''Oprah Prime'' is an interview program that allows [[Oprah Winfrey]] to step "outside of the studio for some riveting, enlightening in-depth conversations with newsmakers, celebrities, thought leaders and real-life families."<ref name="oprah">[http://www.oprah.com/pressroom/OWN-Announces-the-Premiere-of-Oprahs-Next-Chapter 'OWN Announces the Premiere of Oprah's Next Chapter'] ''Oprah.com'' November 18, 2011</ref> The decision to launch ''Oprah Prime'' was made after Oprah reflected on her 25 years on television. "After 25 years I got myself out of the studio chairs. I moved into the next chapter, and I am having more fun than ever – moving around the country and the world talking to people I’m really interested in getting to know and I think viewers will be, too," said Winfrey. "It is so energizing to be out and about in the world exploring new people, new places and new ideas."<ref>[http://dailyvenusdiva.com/2012/01/03/oprah-winfrey-closes-one-chapter-opens-another/ 'Oprah Winfrey Closes One Chapter and Opens Another'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120211054301/http://dailyvenusdiva.com/2012/01/03/oprah-winfrey-closes-one-chapter-opens-another/ |date=2012-02-11 }} ''Daily Venus Diva'' January 3, 2012</ref>

==Reception==

===Critical reception===
''Oprah's Next Chapter'' debuted to generally positive reviews. Sara Vilkomerson of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' stated that the premiere with Steven Tyler showcased Winfrey's trademark skills as "a master interviewer. It’s easy to take for granted, but Winfrey has both an innate ability to get celebrities to open up to her, and zero hesitation over asking tough questions." Vilkomerson further praised the show's behind-the-scenes segments and noted that the show has a more relaxed feel than ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'', which might take some time for viewers to adjust to.<ref>[http://popwatch.ew.com/2012/01/01/oprahs-next-chapter-new-network-new-series-same-oprah/ 'New Network, New Series, Same Oprah'] ''Entertainment Weekly'' January 1, 2012</ref>

[[Piers Morgan]] also praised the show on his Facebook page, saying that it was "fantastic" and that Winfrey was "the undisputed Queen of chat".<ref>https://www.facebook.com/piersmorgan/posts/137097366406205</ref>

Further, Steve Johnson of ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' declared that Winfrey "knows how to steer a celebrity chat" and that her discussion with Tyler in the premiere was "fascinating". On the other hand, Johnson criticized the show's tendency to focus too much on the host; he posits that producers use the behind-the-scenes segments to reveal that Winfrey is the "orchestrator and validator" of the program's revealing conversations.<ref>[https://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/tv/chi-oprah-next-chapter-steven-tyler-20120103,0,5080778.column 'Oprah Begins Next Chapter'] ''Chicago Tribune'' January 3, 2012</ref>

===Ratings===
The two-hour premiere of ''Oprah's Next Chapter'' gave OWN its highest ratings for a Sunday premiere since the network's January 2011 launch weekend, scoring a 1.1 rating in the network's target women 25-54 demographic and 1.1 million total viewers. To put these numbers in context, the ''Oprah's Next Chapter'' premiere represented a 463 percent increase in the demo over the network's December 2011 average in that time period. Only the premiere of ''[[Season 25: Oprah Behind The Scenes]]'', which aired on January 1, 2011, has scored better than the ''Next Chapter'' premiere, drawing a 1.11 in the demo and 1.2 million total viewers."<ref>[https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/01/04/us-oprah-ratings-idUSTRE80300320120104 '"Oprah's Next Chapter" premiere gives OWN ratings boost'] ''Reuters'' January 3, 2012</ref>

According to affiliate ratings, the second week, featuring Winfrey's interview with pastor [[Joel Osteen]], "brought in an audience of 1.6 million during its Sunday night broadcast. It marks a 45 percent growth from the series premiere, and now holds the network record of being the most-watched broadcast since its 2011 launch. It also improved among the women 25-54 demographic, adding 18 percent from the previous episode for a 1.3 rating. The series also built on its audience in the second half-hour, growing from 1.5 million to 1.6 million."<ref>[https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/oprah-winfrey-next-chapter-ratings-joel-osteen-280188 'Oprah Winfrey's ''Oprah's Next Chapter''  Climbs 45 Percent'] ''Hollywood Reporter'' January 10, 2012</ref>

The third week of the show saw a steep decline in viewership as Winfrey's interview with [[Chris Christie]] drew in only 500,000 viewers on OWN - down over 1 million viewers from the week before.<ref>[http://www.nypost.com/p/entertainment/tv/starr_report_3neuOWs0bAGFqwmmIqXmYK 'Starr Report'] ''NYPost'' January 19, 2012</ref> However the following week's interview with [[George Lucas]] saw a slight increase, with 557,000 viewers on OWN.<ref name="hollywoodreporter.com"/>

An interview with [[Whitney Houston]]'s family, including her daughter [[Bobbi Kristina Brown]], attracted 3.5 million viewers. Until the fifth episode of the second season of ''[[The Haves and the Have Nots (TV series)|The Haves and the Have Nots]]'' (3.6 million viewers), it was OWN's highest-rated program to date.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2014/tv/news/owns-haves-and-the-have-nots-surges-to-series-highs-1201088345/|title=OWN’s ‘Haves and the Have Nots’ Surges to Series Highs|last=Kissell|first=Rick|date=2014-02-05|work=Variety|access-date=2018-11-20|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>[https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/03/12/oprahs-next-chapter-bobbi-kristina-whitney-houston-ratings_n_1339825.html 'Oprah's Next Chapter Interview Brings in Record Ratings'] ''Huffington Post'' March 12, 2012</ref>
