The '''Supreme Court''' ({{lang-fil|Kataas-taasang Hukuman}}; colloquially referred to as the '''''Korte Suprema''''') is the highest court in the [[Philippines]]. The Supreme Court was established by the [[Second Philippine Commission]] on June 11, 1901 through the enactment of its Act No. 136,<ref>{{Cite act|type=Section|index=38&ndash;39 of Act No. 136|date=11 June 1901|article=2|article-type=Chapter|legislature=[[Second Philippine Commission]]|title=An act providing for the organization of courts in the Philippine Islands|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t6lEAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA295&lpg=PA295}}</ref> an Act which abolished the ''[[Real Audiencia of Manila|Real Audiencia de Manila]]'', the predecessor of the Supreme Court.<ref name="Gazette 1">{{Cite web |url=https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/about/gov/judiciary/sc/ |title=The Supreme Court {{!}} History of the Supreme Court |website=[[Official Gazette (Philippines)|Official Gazette of the Republic of the Philippines]] |language=en-US |access-date=March 6, 2019}}</ref><ref name="SC 1">{{Cite web |url=http://sc.judiciary.gov.ph/aboutsc/history/index.php |title=A Constitutional History of the Supreme Court of the Philippines |website=Supreme Court of the Philippines |access-date=March 6, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://news.mb.com.ph/2017/06/13/the-supreme-court-at-center-stage |title=The Supreme Court at center stage |last=Brion |first=J.

==History==
===Pre-hispanic period===
Prior to the conquest of Spain, the islands of the Philippines were composed of independent [[barangay state|barangay]]s, each of which is community composed of 30 to 100 families. Typically, a barangay is headed by a ''[[datu]]'' or a local chief who exercises all functions of government—executive, legislative and judicial; he is also the commander-in-chief in times of war. Each barangay has its own laws. Laws may be oral laws, which are the traditions and customs of the locality handed down from a generation to generation, or written laws as promulgated by the ''datu'' who is typically aided by a group of elders. In a confederation of barangays, the laws are promulgated by a superior ''datu'' with the aid of the inferior ''datus''.<ref name="IDE">{{Cite web |url=https://ir.ide.go.jp/index.php?active_action=repository_view_main_item_detail&page_id=39&block_id=158&item_id=33140&item_no=1 |title=I. Overview of the Philippine Judicial System |last=Pangalangan  |first=Raul C.  |date=December 20, 2016 |website=[[Institute of Developing Economies]] |publisher=[[Institute of Developing Economies]]–[[Japan External Trade Organization]] |pages=1–5 |language=ja |access-date=December 20, 2016}}</ref>

In a resolution of dispute, the ''datu'' acts as a judge while a group of elders sits as a jury. If a dispute is between ''datus'' or between members of different barangays, the dispute is settled through arbitration with some other ''datus'' or elders, serving as arbiters or mediators, from other barangays. All trials are held public. When a ''datu'' is in doubt if who between the parties are guilty, the trial is resorted to [[trial by ordeal]]—a common practice in criminal cases. An accused who was innocent was always perceived to be always successful in such ordeals, because the deities or gods of these pre-Hispanic people made the said accused do so.<ref name="IDE"/>

===Hispanic period===
In the royal order of August 14, 1569, [[Miguel López de Legazpi]] was confirmed as the [[Governor-General of the Philippines|Governor]] and [[Captain general of the Navy|Captain-General]] of the Philippines. He was empowered to administer [[civil justice|civil]] and [[criminal justice]] in the islands. Under the same order, Legazpi had original and appellate jurisdiction in all suits and constituted in his person all authority of a department of justice, with complete administrative and governmental control of all judicial offices. In subsequent ''[[decree|cédulas]]'' and royal orders, it was made the duty of all officials to enforce all laws and ordinances issued for the benefits of the locals, but these were not made to have been done. In a 1583 letter written by [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Manila|Bishop]] [[Domingo de Salazar]] to [[Philip II of Spain|King Philip II]], Bishop Salazar noted the different acts of oppression and injustice committed against the native Filipinos and that the decrees of the King, which were designed to protect them, were generally disregarded by the Governor-General and his subordinates.<ref name="Census 1">{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=POAXAAAAYAAJ&q=Royal%2520Order%2520of%2520August%252014%252C%25201569&pg=PA389 |title=Census of the Philippine Islands: Taken Under the Direction of the Philippine Commission in the Year 1903, in Four Volumes. |date=1905 |publisher=[[U.S. Government Printing Office]] |pages=389–410 |language=en |access-date=March 7, 2019 |agency=[[United States Census Bureau]]}}</ref>

As a result of these developments, the first ''[[Real Audiencia|real audiencia]]'' (which is the ''[[Real Audiencia of Manila]]'') or high court was established in the Philippines through the royal decree of May 5, 1583. The decree stated that "the court is founded in the interests of good government and the administration of justice, with the same authority and preeminence as each of the royal audiencias in the town of [[Real Audiencia y Chancillería de Valladolid|Valladolid]] and the city of [[Granada]].<ref name="Census 1" /> The audiencia was composed of a president, three ''[[oidores]]'' or auditors, a fiscal or prosecuting attorney, and the necessary auxiliary officials, such as the court's secretaries and clerks.<ref name="IDE"/><ref name="Census 1" /> The first president was Governor-Captain General [[Santiago de Vera]].<ref name="Census 1" />

The ''Real Audiencia of Manila'' had a jurisdiction covering [[Luzon]] and the rest of the archipelago. It was given an appellate jurisdiction over all civil and criminal cases decided by the governors, ''alcaldes mayores'' and other magistrates of the islands. The ''audiencia'' may only take cognizance of a civil case in its first instance when, on account of its importance, the amount involved and the dignity of the parties might be tried in a superior court; and of criminal cases which may arise in the place where the ''audiencia'' might meet. The decisions of the audiencia in both civil and criminal cases were to be executed without any appeal, except in civil cases were the amount was so large as to justify an appeal to the King; such appeal to the King must be made within one year. All cases were to be decided by a majority vote, and in case of a tie, an advocate was chosen for the determination of the case.<ref name="Census 1" />

The ''audiencia'' would later on be dissolved through the royal ''cédula'' of August 9, 1589. The ''audiencia'' would later on be reestablished through the royal decree of May 25, 1596, and on May 8, 1598, it had resumed its functions as a high court. By its reestablishment, the ''audiencia'' was composed of a president as represented by the governor, four associate justices, prosecuting attorney with the office of protector of the Indians, the assistant prosecuting officers, a reporter, clerk and other officials.<ref name="Census 1" /> By a royal order of March 11, 1776, the ''audiencia'' was reorganized; it consisted of the president, a regent, the immediate head of the ''audiencia'', five ''oidores'' or associate justices, two assistant prosecuting attorneys, five subordinate officials, and two reporters. It had also been allowed to perform the duties of a probate court in special cases. When the high court is acting as administrative or advisory body, the ''audiencia'' acted under the name of ''real acuerdo''. Later on the governor-general was removed as the president of the ''audiencia'' and the ''real acuerdo'' was abolished by virtue of the royal decree of July 4, 1861.<ref name="Census 1" /> The same royal decree converted the court to a pure judicial body, with its decisions appealable to the Supreme Court of Spain.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/about/gov/judiciary/ |title=The Judicial Branch |website=[[Official Gazette (Philippines)|Official Gazette]] |language=en-US |access-date=March 7, 2019}}</ref> By the royal decree of October 24, 1870, the ''audiencia'' was branched into two chambers; these two branches were later renamed as ''sala de lo civil'' and ''sala de lo criminal'' by virtue of royal decree of May 23, 1879.<ref name="Census 1" />

On February 26, 1886, the territorial ''audiencia'' of [[Cebu]] was established through a royal decree, and covers the jurisdiction of the islands of Cebu, [[Negros Island|Negros]], [[Panay]], [[Samar]], [[Palawan|Paragua]], [[Calamian Islands|Calamianes]], [[Masbate]], [[Ticao Island|Ticao]], [[Leyte]], [[Jolo]] and [[Balabac]], including the smaller and adjacent islands of aforementioned islands. By January 5, 1891, a royal decree had established the territorial ''audiencias'' of Manila and Cebu. By virtue of a royal decree, the territorial audiencia in Cebu continued until May 19, 1893 when it ceased to be territorial; its ''audiencia'' for criminal cases, however, was retained.<ref name="Census 1" /> From the same royal decree, the ''audiencia'' in Vigan was established and covers criminal cases in Luzon and [[Batanes]]. These courts decisions are not considered final as they are still appealable to the ''Audiencia Territorial of Manila'' and those of the audiencia to the [[Supreme Court of Spain]].<ref name="IDE"/> These ''audiencias'' would still continue to operate even until the outbreak of the Filipino rebellion in 1896.<ref name="Census 1" />

===American period===
From the start of the American occupation on August 13, 1898, the ''audiencias'' of Cebu and Vigan ceased to function as the judges fled for safety. The following day, [[Wesley Merritt]], the first American [[Governor-General of the Philippines|Military Governor]], ordered the suspension of the territorial jurisdiction of the colonial [[Real Audiencia of Manila]], and of other minor courts in the Philippines. All trial of committed crimes and offenses were transferred to the jurisdiction of the [[United States Military Government of the Philippine Islands|court-martial or military commissions of the United States]]. On October 7, 1898, the civil courts throughout the islands that were constituted under Spanish laws prior to August 13 were permitted to resume their civil jurisdiction but subject to supervision of the American military government. Later on in January 1899, the civil jurisdiction of the ''audiencia'' in Manila was suspended but was restored in May 1899 after it was reestablished as the '''Supreme Court of the Philippine Islands'''. The criminal jurisdiction was also restored to the newly reformed civil high court.<ref name="Census 1"/>

On June 11, 1901, the current Supreme Court was officially established through enactment of Act No. 136, otherwise known as the [[Judiciary Law]] of the Second [[Philippine Commission]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://lawyerly.ph/laws/view/l2739 |title=Act No. 136, (1901-06-11) |date=June 11, 1901 |website=Lawyerly |language=en |access-date=March 18, 2019}}</ref> The said law reorganized the judicial system and vested the judicial power to the Supreme Court, Courts of First Instance and [[Justice of the Peace]] courts. The said law also provided for the early composition of the said High Court, having one Chief Justice and six Associate Justices—all appointed by the commission.<ref name="IDE"/><ref name="Census 1"/> The [[Philippine Organic Act (1902)|Philippine Organic Act of 1902]] and the [[Jones Law (Philippines)|Jones Act of 1916]], both passed by the [[U.S. Congress]], ratified the jurisdiction of the Courts vested by Act No. 136. The Philippine Organic Act of 1902 further provides that the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court and its six Associate Justices shall be appointed by the [[President of the United States]] with the consent and advice of the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]].<ref name="IDE"/>

The enactment of the Administrative Code of 1917 made the Supreme Court the highest tribunal. It also increased the total membership of the Supreme Court, having one Chief Justice and eight Associate Justices.<ref name="MB 1">{{Cite web |url=https://news.mb.com.ph/2018/06/10/supreme-court-day |title=Supreme Court Day |last=Han Dong-Man |date=June 10, 2018 |website=[[Manila Bulletin]] |language=en-US |access-date=March 23, 2019}}</ref>

===Commonwealth period===
With the establishment of the [[Commonwealth of the Philippines]] through the ratification of the [[Constitution of the Philippines|1935 Constitution]], the Supreme Court's composition was increased to eleven, with one Chief Justice and ten Associate Justices.{{ref|n|[n]}} The 1935 Constitution provided for the independence of the judiciary, the security of tenure of its members, prohibition on diminution of compensation during their term of office, and the method of removal of the justices through [[impeachment]]. The Constitution also transferred the rule-making of the legislature to the Supreme Court on 
the power to promulgate rules concerning pleading, practice, court procedures, and admission to the practice of law.<ref name="IDE"/>

===Japanese occupation===
[[File:Chief Justice Jose Abad Santos.jpg|thumb|José Abad Santos, the fifth Chief Justice of the Supreme Court.]]
Within the brief [[Japanese occupation of the Philippines]], the Court remained with no substantial changes in its organizational structure and jurisdiction. However, some acts and outlines of the Court were required to be approved first by the Military Governor of the [[Empire of Japan|Imperial Japanese Force]].<ref name="IDE"/> In 1942, [[José Abad Santos]]—the fifth Chief Justice of the Supreme Court—was executed by Japanese troops after refusing to collaborate with the Japanese military government. He was captured on April 11, 1942 in the province of [[Cebu (province)|Cebu]] and was executed on May 7, 1942 in the town of [[Parang, Maguindanao|Parang]] in [[Mindanao]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/about/gov/judiciary/sc/cj/jose-abad-santos/the-execution-of-jose-abad-santos/ |title=The execution of José Abad Santos |website=[[Official Gazette (Philippines)|Official Gazette of the Republic of the Philippines]] |language=en-US |access-date=March 19, 2019}}</ref>

===Independence and postwar period===
After the end of the Japanese occupation during World War II, Philippines was granted its independence on July 4, 1946 from the United States. The grant of independence was made through the [[Treaty of Manila (1946)|Treaty of Manila of 1946]]. In the said treaty, it provides that:
{{quote|'''ARTICLE V.''' – ''The Republic of the Philippines and the United States of America agree that all cases at law concerning the Government and people of the Philippines which, in accordance with section 7 (6) of the Independence Act of 1934, are pending before the Supreme Court of the United States of America at the date of the granting of the independence of the Republic of the Philippines shall continue to be subject to the review of the Supreme Court of the United States of America for such period of time after independence as may be necessary to effectuate the disposition of the cases at hand. The contracting parties also agree that following the disposition of such cases the Supreme Court of the United States of America will cease to have the right of review of cases originating in the Philippine Islands''.{{ref|o|[o]}}}}

In effect of the treaty, the United States Supreme Court ceased to have appellate power to review cases originating from the Philippines after its independence, with exception of those cases pending before the United States Supreme Court filed prior to the country's independence.

On June 17, 1948, the Judiciary Act of 1948 was enacted. The law grouped cases together over which the high court could exercise its exclusive jurisdiction to review on appeal, ''certiorari'', or writ of error.<ref name="SC 1"/>

In 1973, the 1935 Constitution was revised and was replaced by the 1973 Constitution. Under the said Constitution, the membership of the court was increased to its current number, which is fifteen.{{ref|p|[p]}} All members are said to be appointed by the President alone, without consent, approval, or recommendation of a body or officials.{{ref|q|[q]}} The 1973 Constitution also vested in the Supreme Court administrative supervision over all lower courts which heretofore was under the [[Department of Justice (Philippines)|Department of Justice]].<ref>{{Cite document |last=Davide |first=Hilario Jr. |author-link=Hilario Davide Jr. |date=November 22, 2004 |title=''The Philippine Judiciary: Its Independence and Transformation''}}</ref>

The martial law period brought in many legal issues of transcendental importance and consequence: some of which were the [[Ratification Cases|legality of the ratification]] of the 1973 Constitution, the assumption of the totality of government authority by President Marcos, the power to review the factual basis for a declaration of Martial Law by the Chief Executive.<ref name="SC 1"/>

===Post–EDSA revolution and present===
After the overthrow of [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Ferdinand Marcos]] in 1986, President [[Corazon Aquino]], using her emergency powers, promulgated a transitory charter known as the "Freedom Constitution" which did not affect the composition and powers of the Supreme Court. The Freedom Charter was replaced by the 1987 [[Constitution of the Philippines|Constitution]] which is the fundamental charter in force in the Philippines at present.
Under the current Constitution, it retained and carried the provision in the 1935 and 1973 Constitutions that "judicial power is vested in one Supreme Court and in such lower courts as may be established by law." However, unlike the previous Constitutions, the current Constitution expanded the Supreme Court's judicial power by defining it in the second paragraph of Section 1, Article VIII as:
{{quote|'''SECTION 1. —''' xxx ''Judicial power includes the duty of the courts of justice to settle actual controversies involving rights which are legally demandable and enforceable, and to determine whether or not there has been a grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction on the part of any branch or instrumentality of the Government''.{{ref|r|[r]}}}}

The definition, in effect, diluted the [[political question]] doctrine, that it is best to submit specific questions or issues specific questions to the political wisdom of the people, and thus, as a result, are beyond the review of the courts.<ref name="SC 1"/>

Furthermore, the present Constitution provided for safeguards to ensure the independence of the Judiciary. It also provided for the [[Judicial and Bar Council]], a constitutionally-created body that recommends appointees for vacancies that may arise in the composition of the Supreme Court and other lower courts.<ref name="SC 1"/>

==Overview==
===Qualifications===
According to the Constitution, for a person to be appointed to the Supreme Court, he must be:
# a [[Philippine nationality law#Citizenship by birth|natural-born citizen]] of the Philippines; 
# at least forty years of age, and 
# have been for fifteen years or more a judge of a lower court or engaged in the practice of law in the Philippines.{{ref|d|[d]}}

An additional constitutional requirement, though less precise in nature, is that a judge "must be a person of proven competence, integrity, probity, and independence."{{ref|e|[e]}}

===Composition and manner of appointment===
Pursuant to [[Constitution of the Philippines#Article VIII – Judicial Department|Article VIII]] of the [[Constitution of the Philippines|1987 Constitution of the Philippines]], the Court is composed of the [[Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the Philippines|Chief Justice]] and of the fourteen Associate Justices,{{ref|a|[a]}} all of whom are appointed by the [[President of the Philippines|President]] from a list of nominees made by the [[Judicial and Bar Council]].{{ref|b|[b]}}  An appointment to the Supreme Court needs no confirmation of the [[Commission on Appointments]] as the nomination is already vetted by the [[Judicial and Bar Council]], a constitutionally-created body which recommends appointments within the judiciary.{{ref|b|[b]}}{{ref|c|[c]}}

Upon a vacancy in the Court, whether for the position of [[Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the Philippines|Chief Justice]] or [[Associate Justices of the Supreme Court of the Philippines|Associate Justice]], the [[President of the Philippines|President]] fills the vacancy by appointing a person from a list of at least 3 nominees prepared by the [[Judicial and Bar Council]].{{ref|b|[b]}}

===Retirement===
The 1987 [[Constitution of the Philippines]] provides that:
{{quote|"'''SECTION 11.''' ''The Members of the Supreme Court'' xxx ''shall hold office during good behavior until they reached the age of seventy years or become incapacitated to discharge the duties of their office.''"{{ref|g|[g]}}}}

Supreme Court Justices are obliged to retire upon reaching the mandatory retirement age of 70.{{ref|f|[f]}} Some Justices have opted to retire before reaching the age of 70, such as Florentino Feliciano, who retired at 67 to accept appointment to the [[Appellate Body]] of the [[World Trade Organization]] and [[Alicia Austria-Martinez]] who retired at 68 due to health reasons.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/748232/retired-sc-justice-florentino-feliciano-passes-away-at-87 |title=Justice Florentino Feliciano passes away at 87 |last=Torres-Tupas |first=Tetch |date=December 16, 2015 |website=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]] |language=en |access-date=March 6, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.balita.ca/2012/08/14/a-chief-justice-sereno-is-win-win-for-p-noy/ |title=A Chief Justice Sereno is win-win for P-Noy |date=August 14, 2012 |website=Balita |language=en-US |access-date=March 6, 2019}}</ref>

Since 1901, only [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the Philippines|Associate Justice]] Austria-Martinez has so far resigned for health reasons. In September 2008, Austria-Martinez, citing health reasons, filed a letter to the Court through Chief Justice [[Reynato Puno]], tendering her [[resignation]] effective April 30, 2009, or 15 months before her compulsory retirement on December 19, 2010.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://news.abs-cbn.com/nation/09/30/08/exclusive-sc-justice-alicia-martinez-retire-early |title=Exclusive: SC Justice Alicia Martinez to retire early |last=Rufo |first=Aries |date=September 30, 2008 |website=[[ABS-CBN News]] |access-date=March 6, 2019}}</ref> This was followed by Justice [[Martin Villarama Jr.]], who resigned in January 2016 due to health reasons.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/543087/news/nation/sc-justice-villarama-seeks-early-retirement-due-to-deteriorating-health/ |title=SC Justice Villarama seeks early retirement due to deteriorating health |last=Merueñas |first=Mark |date=November 4, 2015 |website=[[GMA News]] |language=en-US |access-date=March 6, 2019}}</ref>

[[File:Supreme_Court_of_the_Philippines_building_in_Baguio.JPG|thumb|right|Supreme Court Building, Baguio City]]
The Supreme Court currently meets at the New Supreme Court Building along [[Padre Faura Street]], adjacent to the location of [[Department of Justice (Philippines)|Department of Justice]] and within the area occupied by the [[University of the Philippines Manila]].

The Supreme Court first met in 1901 at the [[Ayuntamiento de Manila]] in [[Plaza Roma]], [[Intramuros]] with the Salas De Sessiones serving as the Session Hall. The Court eventually transferred to the [[Old Legislative Building]] together with [[Congress of the Philippines|Philippine Legislature]] in 1941 under Chief Justice [[José P. Laurel]].

During [[World War II]], the Court temporarily transferred to Mabini Hall of the [[Malacañang Palace]] due to the destruction of  the Old Legislative Building and the Ayuntamiento.

In 1951, the Court transferred back to the Old Supreme Court Building, originally built as part of the Manila campus of the University of the Philippines. The façade of the Old Supreme Court Building displays the busts of the first nine Chief Justices of the Supreme Court and the statues of [[Lady Justice]] and [[Moses]] at its entrance. The Court transferred to its current address in 1991, after the [[Department of Foreign Affairs (Philippines)|Department of Foreign Affairs]], which previously occupied the area, transferred to [[Roxas Boulevard]].

The current building of the Supreme Court was designed by the Filipino architect Antonio Toledo in accordance to the [[Capital of the Philippines#1905 Burnham Plan of Manila|1905 Burnham Plan of Manila]]. The four pillars of the façade of the Supreme Court represent the four levels of the hierarchy of the judiciary. The bronze statues of the seated figures of Chief Justices [[Cayetano Arellano]] and [[José Abad Santos]] are guarding each side of the entrance to the Court. Upon entering the Supreme Court Building, the main lobby, with the logo of the Court, will be found at its center. To the right is the Dignitaries' Lounge and to the left is the Division Hearing Room. The second floor of the building is where the gallery of the portraits of the chief justices and the ''en banc'' session hall is located.<ref>[http://sc.judiciary.gov.ph/files/benchmark/2018_BM%201-2.pdf Benchmark Volume 1, June 2018]</ref>

Since 1948, The Supreme Court has held its summer sessions in [[Baguio]] during the whole month of April.<ref>[https://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/iq/200482-reasons-supreme-court-justices-baguio-every-april Why Supreme Court Justices go to Baguio every April]</ref>

The Court will move to the [[Supreme Court Building Complex, Fort Bonifacio]], [[Bonifacio Global City]], [[Taguig City]] upon its completion.

==Language==
Since the courts' creation, English had been used in court proceedings. But for the first time in Philippine judicial history on August 22, 2007, three [[Malolos City]] regional trial courts in [[Bulacan]] announced that will use only [[Filipino language|Filipino]] in court proceedings to promote the national language. Twelve [[stenographers]] from Branches 6, 80 and 81, as model courts, had undergone training at Marcelo H. del Pilar College of Law of [[Bulacan State University]] College of Law following a directive from the Supreme Court of the Philippines. Chief Justice [[Reynato Puno]] envisioned to implement the policy in other areas such as [[Laguna (province)|Laguna]], [[Cavite]], [[Quezon]], [[Nueva Ecija]], [[Batangas]], [[Rizal]], and [[Metro Manila]].<ref>[http://globalnation.inquirer.net/news/news/view_article.php?article_id=84080 Inquirer.net, 3 Bulacan courts to use Filipino in judicial proceedings] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080521190134/http://globalnation.inquirer.net/news/news/view_article.php?article_id=84080 |date=May 21, 2008 }}</ref>

[[Spanish language|Spanish]] has also been used in court proceedings, particularly in the years prior to Philippine independence, with a number of cases having decisions written in the language. Although Spanish is no longer used in the court system, the language has influenced existing [[List of Philippine legal terms|Philippine legal terminology]].

{{listen|type=speech|filename=Supreme Court of the Philippines session beginning announcement.flac|title=Supreme Court session opening announcement|description=The [[court crier]] speaks the opening announcement. This recording took place before the oral argument by the petitioners in ''[[Disini v. Secretary of Justice]]''.}}
The wording of the session opening announcement, below, is similar to that used by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]]. Notable, however, is the use of the more familiar term "[[hear ye]]" over the archaic [[Law French]] term [[oyez]].

<blockquote>The honorable, the Chief Justice and the Associate Justices of the Supreme Court of the Philippines. Hear ye, hear ye, hear ye! All persons having business before the honorable Supreme Court of the Philippines shall give their attention, for the Court is now in session.<ref name="Disinioralarg"/></blockquote>

After the announcement, the Chief Justice bangs the [[gavel]], and typically, first calls the [[clerk of court]], who describes the first case on the calendar and calls the attorneys who will be making oral arguments to speak.<ref name="Disinioralarg">Oral argument in ''[[Disini v. Secretary of Justice]]'': [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Disini_v._Secretary_of_Justice,_oral_arguments_by_petitioners,_2013-01-15.mp3]</ref>

==Powers and jurisdiction==

===Adjudicatory powers===
{{see also|Judicial review in the Philippines}}
The powers of the Supreme Court are defined in Article VIII of the [[Constitution of the Philippines|1987 Constitution]]. These functions may be generally divided into two—[[judiciary|judicial functions]] and [[management|administrative functions]]. The administrative functions of the Court pertain to the supervision and control over the Philippine judiciary and its employees, as well as over members of the [[Philippine Bar Examination|Philippine bar]]. Pursuant to these functions, the Court is empowered to order a change of venue of trial in order to avoid a miscarriage of justice and to appoint all officials and employees of the judiciary.{{ref|h|[h]}} The Court is further authorized to promulgate the rules for admission to the practice of law, for legal assistance to the underprivileged, and the procedural rules to be observed in all courts.{{ref|h|[h]}}

The more prominent role of the Court is located in the exercise of its judicial functions. Section 1 of Article VIII contains definition of judicial power that had not been found in previous constitutions. The judicial power is vested in "one Supreme Court and in such lower courts as may be established by law."{{ref|i|[i]}} This judicial power is exercised through the judiciary's primary role of adjudication, which includes the "duty of the courts of justice to settle actual controversies involving rights which are legally demandable and enforceable, and to determine whether or not there has been a grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction on the part of any branch or instrumentality of the government."{{ref|i|[i]}}

The definition reaffirms the power of the Supreme Court to engage in [[Judicial review#Judicial review in the Philippines|judicial review]], a power that had traditionally belonged to the Court even before this provision was enacted. Still, this new provision effectively dissuades from the easy resort to the [[political question]] doctrine as a means of declining to review a law or state action, as was often done by the Court during the rule of [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Ferdinand Marcos]].<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3WzdhH8P1pYC&q=The+1987+Constitution+of+the+Republic+of+the+Philippines:+A+Commentary+Bernas+1996+ed |title=The 1987 Constitution of the Republic of the Philippines: A Commentary |last=Bernas |first=Joaquin G. |publisher=Rex Book Store |year=1996 |isbn=9789712320132 |pages=831 |language=en |author-link=Joaquin Bernas}}</ref> As a result, the existence of "grave abuse of discretion" on the part of any branch or instrumentality of the government is sufficient basis to nullify state action.

===Original jurisdiction===
The other mode by which a case reaches the Supreme Court is through an original petition filed directly with the Supreme Court, in cases that the [[Constitution of the Philippines|Constitution]] establishes "original jurisdiction" with the Supreme Court. Under Section 5(1), Article VIII of the Constitution, they are "cases affecting ambassadors, other public ministers and consuls, and over petitions for certiorari, prohibition, mandamus, quo warranto, and habeas corpus." Resort to ''[[certiorari]]'', [[prohibition (writ)|prohibition]] and ''[[mandamus]]'' may be availed of only if "there is no appeal, or any plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law."{{ref|j|[j]}}

However, notwithstanding the grant of original jurisdiction, the Court has, through the years, assigned to lower courts such as the [[Philippine Court of Appeals|Court of Appeals]] the power to hear petitions for certiorari, prohibition, mandamus, [[quo warranto]] and [[habeas corpus]]. As a result, the Court has considerable discretion to refuse to hear these petitions filed directly before it on the ground that such should have been filed instead with the Court of Appeals or the appropriate lower court. Nonetheless, cases that have attracted wide public interest or for which a speedy resolution is of the essence have been accepted for decision by the Supreme Court without hesitation.

In cases involving the original jurisdiction of the Court, there must be a finding of "grave abuse of discretion" on the part of the respondents to the suit to justify favorable action on the petition. The standard of "grave abuse of discretion", a markedly higher standard than "error of law", has been defined as "a capricious and whimsical exercise of judgment amounting to lack of jurisdiction."{{ref|k|[k]}}

===Appellate review===
Far and away the most common mode by which a case reaches the Supreme Court is through an [[appeal]] from a decision rendered by a lower court. Appealed cases generally originate from [[lawsuits]] or [[indictment|criminal indictments]] filed and tried before the trial courts. These decisions of the trial courts may then be elevated on appeal to the [[Philippine Court of Appeals|Court of Appeals]], or more rarely, directly to the Supreme Court if only “questions of law” are involved. Apart from decisions of the Court of Appeals, the Supreme Court may also directly review on appeal decisions rendered by the [[Sandiganbayan]] and the [[Philippine Court of Tax Appeals|Court of Tax Appeals]]. Decisions rendered by administrative agencies are not directly appealable to the Supreme Court, they must be first challenged before the Court of Appeals. However, decisions of the [[Commission on Elections (Philippines)|Commission on Elections]] may be elevated directly for review to the Supreme Court, although the procedure is not, strictly speaking, in the nature of an appeal.

Review on appeal is not as a matter of right, but "of sound judicial discretion and will be granted only when there are special and important reasons therefor".{{ref|l|[l]}} In the exercise of appellate review, the Supreme Court may reverse the decision of lower courts upon a finding of an "error of law". The Court generally declines to engage in review the findings of fact made by the lower courts, although there are notable exceptions to this rule. The Court also refuses to entertain cases originally filed before it that should have been filed first with the trial courts.

===Rule-making power===
The Supreme Court has the exclusive power to promulgate rules concerning the protection and enforcement of constitutional rights, pleading, practice, and
procedure in all courts, the admission to the practice of law, the integrated bar, and legal assistance to the underprivileged. Any such rules shall provide a simplified and inexpensive procedure for the speedy disposition of cases, shall be uniform for all courts of the same grade, and shall not diminish, increase, or modify substantive rights. Rules of procedure of special courts and quasi‐judicial bodies shall remain effective unless disapproved by the Supreme Court. (Art. VIII, §54(5))

====Writs of ''amparo'' and ''habeas data''====
{{main|Writ of Amparo and Habeas Data (Philippines)}}

The Supreme Court approved the Writ of Amparo on September 25, 2007.<ref>[http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view_article.php?article_id=90626 Inquirer.net, SC approves use of writ of amparo] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017222159/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view_article.php?article_id=90626 |date=October 17, 2007 }}</ref> The writ of amparo (Spanish for protection) strips the military of the defense of simple denial. Under the writ, families of victims have the right to access information on their cases—a constitutional right called the "''habeas data''" common in several Latin American countries. The rule is enforced retroactively. Chief Justice Puno stated that "If you have this right, it would be very, very difficult for State agents, State authorities to be able to escape from their culpability."<ref>[http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view_article.php?article_id=83222 Inquiret.net, Military can’t shrug off killings—Chief Justice]</ref><ref>[http://www.gmanews.tv/story/56476/SC-ready-with-writ-of-amparo-by-September---Puno ABS-CBN Interactive, SC ready with writ of amparo by Sept – Puno]</ref>

Puno also stated that the court will soon issue rules on the writ of [[Habeas Data]] and the implementing guidelines for [[Habeas Corpus]]. The petition for the writ of amparo may be filed "''on any day and at any time''" with the Regional Trial Court, or with the [[Sandiganbayan]], the Court of Appeals, and the Supreme Court. The interim reliefs under amparo are: temporary protection order (TPO), inspection order (IO), production order (PO), and witness protection order (WPO, RA 6981).<ref>[http://www.gmanews.tv/story/61889/SC-approves-rule-on-writ-of-amparo-vs-extralegal-killings GMA NEWS.TV,  SC approves rule on writ of amparo vs extralegal killings]</ref>

The [[Asian Human Rights Commission]] (AHRC) has criticized the [[Writ of Amparo and Habeas Data (Philippines)|Writ of Amparo and Habeas Data]] for being insufficient, saying further action must be taken, including enacting laws for protection against torture, [[enforced disappearance]], and laws to provide legal remedies to victims. AHRC said the [[writ]] failed to protect non-witnesses, even if they too face threats.<ref>[http://www.gmanews.tv/story/62409/Writ-of-amparo-not-enough--Hong-Kong-rights-group GMA NEWS.TV, Writ of amparo not enough – Hong Kong rights group]</ref>

On August 30, 2007, Puno vowed to institute the ''writ of habeas data'' as a new legal remedy to the [[extrajudicial killing]]s and enforced disappearances. Puno explained that the ''writ of amparo'' denies to authorities defense of simple denial, and ''habeas data'' can find out what information is held by the officer, rectify or even the destroy erroneous data gathered.<ref>[http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view_article.php?article_id=85617 Inquirer.net,  Habeas data: SC’s new remedy vs killings, disappearances]</ref>

On January 22, 2008, the Supreme Court en banc approved the rules for the writ of [[Habeas Data]] ("to protect a person’s right to privacy and allow a person to control any information concerning them"), effective on February 2, the Philippines’ Constitution Day.<ref>[http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view/20080122-114091/Supreme-Court-okays-rules-of-habeas-data newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews, Supreme Court okays rules of ‘habeas data’]</ref>

==Divisions==
The Court is authorized to sit either ''[[en banc]]'' or in divisions of three, five or seven members. Since 1987, the Court has divided itself into 3 divisions with 5 members each. A majority of the cases are heard and decided by the divisions, rather than the Court ''en banc''. However, the Constitution requires that the Court hear ''en banc'' "[a]ll cases involving the constitutionality of a treaty, international or executive agreement, as well as "those involving the constitutionality, application, or operation of presidential decrees, proclamations, orders, instructions, ordinances, and other regulations". The Court ''en banc'' also decides cases originally heard by a division when a majority vote cannot be reached within the division. The Court also has the discretion to hear a case ''en banc'' even if no constitutional issue is involved, as it typically does if the decision would reverse precedent or presents novel or important questions.

Formerly under the 1935, 1973 and the 1986 Freedom Constitutions, the Court is authorized only to sit either ''en banc'' or in divisions of two.

==Public perception==
===Judicial corruption===
On January 25, 2005, and on December 10, 2006, [[Philippines]] [[Social Weather Stations]] released the results of its two surveys on corruption in the [[judiciary]]; it published that: a) like 1995, 1/4 of [[lawyers]] said many/very many [[judge]]s are corrupt. But (49%) stated that judges received bribes, just 8% of lawyers admitted they reported the [[bribery]], because they could not prove it. [Tables 8–9];  judges, however,  said, just 7% call many/very many judges as corrupt[Tables 10–11];b) "Judges see some corruption; proportions who said – many/very many corrupt judges or justices: 17% in reference to RTC judges, 14% to MTC judges, 12% to Court of Appeals justices, 4% i to Shari'a Court judges, 4% to [[Sandiganbayan]] justices and 2% in reference to Supreme Court justices [Table 15].<ref>[http://www.sws.org.ph/pr061210.htm www.sws.org.ph, New Diagnostic Study Sets Guideposts for Systematic Development of the Judiciary] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150517073044/http://www.sws.org.ph/pr061210.htm |date=May 17, 2015 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.sws.org.ph/pr050125.htm www.sws.org.ph, New SWS Study of the Judiciary and the Legal Profession Sees Some Improvements, But Also Recurring Problems] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150517072913/http://www.sws.org.ph/pr050125.htm |date=May 17, 2015 }}</ref>

The September 14, 2008, Political and Economic Risk Consultancy ([[Political and Economic Risk Consultancy|PERC]]) survey, ranked the [[Philippines]] 6th (6.10)  among corrupt Asian judicial systems. PERC stated that "despite India and the Philippines being democracies, expatriates did not look favourably on their judicial systems because of corruption." PERC reported [[Hong Kong]] and [[Singapore]] have the best judicial systems in [[Asia]], with Indonesia and Vietnam the worst: Hong Kong's judicial system scored 1.45 on the scale (zero representing the best performance and 10 the worst); Singapore with a grade of 1.92, followed by Japan (3.50), South Korea (4.62), Taiwan (4.93), the [[Philippines]] (6.10), Malaysia (6.47), India (6.50), Thailand (7.00), China (7.25), Vietnam's (8.10) and Indonesia (8.26).<ref>[http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5gIkKvk-YnNQ1HVb2n_HUUMhncDLA afp.google.com/article, Hong Kong has best judicial system in Asia: business survey] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110521100223/http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5gIkKvk-YnNQ1HVb2n_HUUMhncDLA |date=May 21, 2011 }}</ref><<ref>[http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/world/09/15/08/hong-kong-has-best-judicial-system-asia-business-survey www.abs-cbnnews.com, Hong Kong has best judicial system in Asia: business survey]</ref>

In 2014, [[Transparency International]] Corruption Perceptions Index (global [[Statistical survey|survey]] ranking countries in terms of perceived corruption), the Philippines ranked 85th out of 175 countries surveyed, an improvement from placing 94th in 2013. It scored 38 on a scale of 1 to 100
in the Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI).<ref>[http://globalnation.inquirer.net/115053/ph-improves-rank-in-global-corruption-index PH improves rank in global corruption index]</ref>

The Philippines jumped nine places in the recently published [[World Justice Project]] (WJP) Rule of Law Index 2015, making it one of the most improved countries in terms of global rankings. It ranked 51st out of 102 countries on the ROLI, a significant jump from last year when the country ranked 60th out of 99 countries. This makes the Philippines the most improved among ASEAN member nations. "Results showed that the country ranked high in terms of constraints on government powers (39th); absence of corruption (47th), and open government (50th)."

"The Philippines, however, fell to the bottom half of the global rankings in terms of regulatory enforcement (52nd); order and security (58th); criminal justice (66th); fundamental rights (67th), and civil justice (75th)."<ref>[http://business.inquirer.net/193172/ph-is-most-improved-in-rule-of-law-index Inquirer.net PH is most improved in rule of law index]</ref>

"Watch the Supreme Court" [[coalition]] was launched at the Training Center, Ground Floor, Supreme Court Centennial Bldg on November 17, 2008, "to ensure the fair and honest selection of the 7 [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the Philippines|Associate Justices of the Supreme Court]] on 2009." Members of “Bantay Korte Suprema” include retired Philippine presidents, retired Supreme Court justices, legislators, legal practitioners, the academe, the business community and the media. former Senate President [[Jovito Salonga]], UP Law Dean [[Marvic Leonen]], Senate Majority Leader and [[Judicial and Bar Council (Philippines)|Judicial and Bar Council]] member [[Kiko Pangilinan]], the [[Philippine Bar Association]], [[Artemio Panganiban]], and Rodolfo Urbiztondo, of the 48,000-strong [[Integrated Bar of the Philippines]] (IBP), and the chambers of commerce, witnessed the landmark event. BKS will neither select nor endorse a candidate, “but if it receive information that makes a candidate incompetent, it will divulge this to the public and inform the [[Judicial and Bar Council (Philippines)|JBC]]." At the BKS launching, the [[memorandum of understanding]] (MOU) on the public monitoring of the selection of justices to the SC was signed.

Meanwhile, the Supreme Court Appointments Watch (SCAW) coalition of law groups and civil society to monitor the appointment of persons to judicial positions was also re-launched.
