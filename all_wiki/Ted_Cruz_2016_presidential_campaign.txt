The '''2016 presidential campaign of Ted Cruz''', the junior [[United States Senate|United States Senator]] from [[Texas]], was announced on March 23, 2015. He was a candidate for the Republican Party's 2016 presidential nomination and won the second-most state contests and delegates. Cruz themed his campaign around being an outsider and a strict conservative. In the crowded early field, he chose not to directly confront the leading candidate, [[Donald Trump]], who was also viewed as an outsider candidate. His cordial and sympathetic tone towards Trump contrasted with the more critical approach of rivals such as [[Jeb Bush]], [[Marco Rubio]], and [[Rand Paul]]. Had Cruz been elected, he would have been the first Cuban American U.S. president and the first U.S. president born outside of the [[United States]] or the [[Thirteen Colonies]].

As the field narrowed, Cruz's position in the race strengthened, owing to his debate performances and strong field infrastructure. He won the Iowa Caucuses in February, the first contest of the race. But as the field narrowed and less-viable candidates dropped out, Republican support concentrated around Trump rather than Cruz. Trump beat Cruz handily on Super Tuesday and in most subsequent primaries. At this point, with the race essentially narrowed to one between Cruz and Trump, the two candidates began to openly criticize each other (whereas they had previously been notably cordial). Trump repeatedly called Cruz "Lyin' Ted" and on one occasion retweeted a deprecating tweet regarding the physical appearance of Cruz's wife. Trump also parroted a story in the ''[[National Enquirer]]'' claiming that Cruz's father, [[Rafael Cruz]], was involved in the [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|Assassination of President John F. Kennedy]]. Cruz called Trump a chronic liar, "completely amoral", and questioned whether he was a genuine conservative.

In late April, while trailing Trump heavily in the delegate count, Cruz announced that his vice presidential running mate would be former-candidate [[Carly Fiorina]]. A week later, he lost the [[2016 Indiana Republican primary|Indiana primary]], which he had called pivotal to stopping Trump from clinching the nomination. Having become mathematically disqualified from achieving a majority of delegates prior to the first convention vote, he suspended his campaign the same night.

Cruz journeyed to the southern states in the days following the debate, eight of which being slated to cast ballots on March 1 on a day monikered the "SEC Primary". He courted voters while going on bus tours, his rivals spending time campaigning in Iowa. "Like the SEC does two-a-days, we're doing two-a-days here right now," Cruz campaign manager Jeff Roe said.

The second Republican presidential debate took place on September 16, at the [[Ronald Reagan Presidential Library and Museum]] in [[Simi Valley, California]]. As with the first debate, Cruz did not participate in the "verbal combat" between the other candidates, only criticizing former Presidents [[George H. W. Bush]] and [[George W.

=== Post-CNBC debate ===
[[File:Ted Cruz by Gage Skidmore 7.jpg|thumb|right|Cruz speaking at an event hosted by the Iowa Republican Party in October 2015]]
Cruz was a participant in the [[CNBC]] Republican presidential debate on October 28. In his opening statement, he stressed his willingness to govern properly, and later in the debate charged the moderators with asking bait questions. Cruz's performance was well-received, as he had "effectively articulated" his strategy of being the second choice for voters, enough of which would give him "the broadest base of support left when the dust clears."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/president-ted-cruz_563225bfe4b0631799111c1c|title=Ted Cruz Is Looking Surprisingly Good|date=October 29, 2015|work=The Huffington Post}}</ref> Cruz was also seen as having won the debate.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ted-cruz-won-republican-debate_5632529ee4b063179911600d|title=Face It: Ted Cruz Won The Republican Debate|work=The Huffington Post|first=Zach|last=Carter}}</ref> Cruz was the most discussed of all candidates on [[Facebook]] the night of the debate and came in second to Donald Trump on [[Twitter]] for the most-talked about.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2015/10/29/ted-cruz-wins-gop-debate-on-facebook/|title=Ted Cruz Wins GOP Debate on Facebook|date=October 29, 2015|work=The Wall Street Journal|first=Natalie|last=Andrews}}</ref>

As a result of many candidates feeling the CNBC debate was not balanced, some candidates signed a list of debate demands.

Establishment favorite [[Jeb Bush]] also had his hopes of a late surge dimmed by his reputation as a moderate on immigration. In contrast, Rubio and Cruz, who had publicly taken hardline positions on both topics, saw their polls rise. By the end of November, poll averages showed Rubio in second place and Cruz in a close third place nationally.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/poll-carson-collapses-rubio-surges-in-n.h./article/2576694|title=Poll: Carson collapses, Rubio surges in N.H.|work=Washington Examiner|access-date=December 2, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Cruz Surges in Iowa Poll After Paris Attacks|url=http://time.com/4125097/ted-cruz-iowa-polling-paris-attacks/|work=Time|access-date=December 2, 2015}}</ref>

On February 1, 2016, Cruz won the first Republican nomination contest, the [[Iowa]] Republican caucus.

February 9's New Hampshire primary, barely a week later, did not provide shocks; Cruz finished with 12% of the vote, behind Trump and Kasich, and ahead of Bush and Rubio. Owing to the fact that Kasich and Bush had invested significantly in the New Hampshire race - hoping to win it and consolidate the moderate "lane" - the underwhelming results did not provide a boost to their campaigns. 

Ahead of the February 20 South Carolina primary, Cruz and Rubio became entangled in a heated exchange in a CBS-hosted debate. Cruz referred to an interview of Rubio on [[Univision]] and alleged that Rubio had stated a different position on immigration from his public stance, in effect accusing him of pandering to the Hispanic audience. Rubio then responded with the accusation that Cruz could not speak Spanish and hence could not have understood his remarks. Cruz, agitated, asked in spoken Spanish for Rubio to continue his own statement in Spanish. Rubio brushed off the exchange and accused Cruz of frequent dishonesty, pointing to the controversy over the Iowa caucus in particular. The exchange became highly discussed in social media and was notable as the first instance of Spanish being spoken in an American major party presidential debate; [[Beto O'Rourke]] later did the same in a 2019 Democratic debate.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/02/14/politics/marco-rubio-ted-cruz-lies/|title=Marco Rubio accuses Ted Cruz of lying|date=February 14, 2016|publisher=CNN|first=Eric|last=Bradner}}</ref> 

In the subsequent [[2016 United States presidential election in South Carolina|South Carolina Republican primary]], Cruz narrowly finished 3rd behind Rubio by a tiny margin of 0.15%.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-wins-south-carolina-bush-drops-out-of-gop-race/2016/02/20/16f80c9a-d655-11e5-be55-2cc3c1e4b76b_story.html|title=Trump wins South Carolina; Bush drops out of GOP race|date=February 21, 2016|newspaper=Washington Post}}</ref> The following day, Bush dropped out of the presidential race, while Cruz declared that he and Rubio had "effectively tied" for 2nd behind Trump, with the implication that both were vying for the status as the mainstream conservative challenger to Trump.<ref name=effectivelytied>{{cite news|url=https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/ted-cruz-effectively-tied-marco-rubio-south-carolinas/story?id=37092860|title=Ted Cruz Says He 'Effectively Tied' Marco Rubio in South Carolina's Republican Primary|date=February 20, 2016|publisher=ABC News}}</ref>

===Super Tuesday===

Prior to the evening of the Iowa Caucus, the Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz campaigns used the published state voter roster entries to send a targeted mailing to past Iowa voters. The mailing envelopes were designed to appear to originate from an election authority, with large wording announcing "VOTER VIOLATION" on the exterior in a bold red box.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/ted-cruzs-iowa-mailers-are-more-fraudulent-than-everyone-thinks|title=Ted Cruz's Iowa Mailers Are More Fraudulent Than Everyone Thinks|author=Lizza, Ryan |date=January 31, 2016|work=The New Yorker}}</ref> Some recipients stated they were intimidated by the content, which revealed their past voter participation and their adjacent neighbors' participation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailywire.com/news/3099/no-cruz-didnt-win-iowa-cheating-heres-why-trumps-ben-shapiro|title=No, Cruz Didn't Win Iowa By Cheating.

During caucus evening in Iowa, news reports from CNN reporters indicated correctly that Carson's itinerary was to go home to Florida before the night's caucus results and then to Washington, DC prayer breakfast, not New Hampshire or South Carolina; the Cruz campaign began to reference these reports in news interviews and Twitter posts, misrepresenting them as reporting indicating that Carson was planning to withdraw from the campaign.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mediaite.com/online/cnn-cruz-heres-why/|title=CNN, Cruz & Carson Campaigns All Deserve Blame for Iowa Misinformation Missteps; Here's Why|access-date=February 11, 2016|publisher=[[Mediaite]]|date=February 4, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2016/02/07/fact-checking-the-eighth-gop-debate/|title=Fact Checking the Eighth GOP Debate|access-date=February 11, 2016|newspaper=Washington Post|date=February 7, 2016}}</ref>{{clarify|date=March 2016}} Cruz apologized via a direct phone call to Dr. Ben Carson later and repeated the apology in a CNN interview.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mediaite.com/tv/ted-cruz-apologizes-to-ben-carson-for-spreading-rumor-he-was-dropping-out/ |title=Ted Cruz Apologizes to Ben Carson For Spreading Rumor He Was Dropping Out |publisher=Mediaite |date=2016-02-02 |access-date=2016-04-22}}</ref> Campaign surrogate Peter King defended his part in the events, and Cruz said that he would not punish any of his staff for spreading rumors of Carson's exit from the campaign.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/268051-steve-king-i-had-obligation-to-tell-iowa-voters-about |title=Rep.

At the New Hampshire ABC debate Donald Trump accused the Cruz campaign of "dirty tricks" for targeting Dr. Ben Carson during the caucusing in Iowa. Afterwards, Cruz's communications director, Rick Tyler, publicized a video with inaccurate subtitle captions portraying Marco Rubio criticizing the ''Bible''. The next day, February 22, Tyler apologized to Rubio on his Facebook page for publishing the video. Shortly after that, Cruz requested Tyler's resignation.<ref>{{cite news|title=Ted Cruz Fires Communications Director Rick Tyler Over Falsified Rubio Video|url=http://insider.foxnews.com/2016/02/22/ted-cruz-fires-communications-director-rick-tyler-over-falsified-rubio-video|access-date=February 22, 2016|publisher=[[Fox News]]|date=February 22, 2016}}</ref>

After Tyler's resignation, Marco Rubio called Cruz "a liar" during the Houston CNN/Telemundo debate held February 25; Donald Trump repeated the "a liar" phrase targeting Cruz in that CNN debate and the two campaigns attributed the threads of alleged past deceit in Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Super Tuesday directly to Cruz, downplaying the Tyler resignation.<ref>{{cite news|title=How Marco Rubio Blunted Ted Cruz and Boosted Donald Trump|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2016-02-24/how-marco-rubio-blunted-ted-cruz-and-boosted-donald-trump|access-date=February 24, 2016|publisher=[[Bloomberg News]]|date=February 24, 2016}}</ref>

Analyzing the internal exit polling of the primary results, the impact of these accusations affected the evangelical Christian voters in the South Carolina candidate selection. Self-identified evangelicals did not agree with the candidate values of Donald Trump closely matching their values, but selected Donald Trump in a higher percentage than Cruz, the likely favored candidate among this group.<ref>{{cite news|title=South Carolina Exit Polls|url= http://www.cnn.com/election/primaries/polls/sc/Rep|access-date=March 3, 2016|publisher=CNN|date=March 1, 2016}}</ref>

This was one day after he lost a series of primaries in the northeast and later dropped out of the race. The Cruz campaign would later attribute their loss to not having selected Rubio as running mate, as hypothetical polling showed Cruz defeating Trump by a large margin with Rubio as the vice presidential candidate. However, Rubio denounced any interest at the time, which convinced the campaign to not approach him.<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.cnn.com/2016/05/08/politics/republican-officials-donald-trump-marco-rubio-ted-cruz/index.html|title=Cruz campaign: We could have stopped Trump if Rubio became running mate|date=May 8, 2016|publisher=CNN}}</ref> On April 30, Former [[Governor of California]] [[Pete Wilson]] endorsed Cruz during a joint appearance at the state Republican Party's convention.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2016/04/30/pete-wilson-of-california-backs-ted-cruz-and-warns-of-donald-trump/|title=Pete Wilson of California Backs Ted Cruz and Warns of Donald Trump|date=April 30, 2016|newspaper=New York Times}}</ref> The same day, it was reported that 10 of the 13 [[Virginia]] delegates at that state's Republican convention were loyal to Cruz.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/cruz-wins-the-most-delegates-at-virginia-gop-convention/2016/04/30/f6b9ea9a-0efb-11e6-8ab8-9ad050f76d7d_story.html|title=Ted Cruz wins the most delegates at Virginia GOP convention|date=April 30, 2016|newspaper=Washington Post}}</ref>

While unusual, it was not completely unprecedented for Cruz to announce a running mate without securing the nomination.

The May 3 [[Indiana Republican primary, 2016|Indiana primary]] was widely seen as make or break for the Cruz campaign by commentators and pundits who speculated a loss for Cruz would mean a nomination for Trump.

The Kennedy family has spoken out condemning the claims with open letters to the media regarding the positions of Kennedy and Cruz.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/01/ted-cruz-john-f-kennedy-213545|last=Schlossberg|first=Jack|date=2016-01-20|title=Ted Cruz Is No Jack Kennedy|newspaper=[[Politico]]|access-date=2016-02-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.people.com/article/jfk-grandson-ted-cruz-no-jack-kennedy|last=McAfee|first=Tierney|title=JFK's Grandson Skewers Ted Cruz: He 'Is No Jack Kennedy'|website=people.com|publisher=Time|access-date=2016-02-17|date=2016-01-21}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boston.com/news/politics/2016/01/21/jfk-grandson-ted-cruz-claim-that-jfk-would-republican-today-absurd/C7LW0rT7XnKDGvzIcZPqyH/story.html|last=Levenson|first=Eric|title=JFK's grandson: Ted Cruz's claim that JFK would be Republican today is 'absurd'|website=boston.com|publisher=Boston Globe Media Partners|access-date=2016-02-17|date=2016-01-21}}</ref>

In April 2016, the campaigns of Cruz and [[John Kasich]] agreed to "split up" some of the remaining primaries in an effort to block [[Donald Trump]] from gaining the 1,237 delegates necessary to clinch the GOP nomination. However, the pact proved challenging; for example, though Cruz was intended to focus on the Indiana primary, Kasich said that his supporters should still vote for him there.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/04/25/politics/ted-cruz-john-kasich-joined-forces/|title=How Cruz and Kasich joined forces|date=April 25, 2016|publisher=CNN}}</ref> And days later, Cruz clarified that there is "no alliance" but, rather, he and Kasich "made a determination where to focus [the campaigns'] energies."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/04/28/politics/john-kasich-ted-cruz-alliance/index.html|title=Ted Cruz on John Kasich: 'There is no alliance'|date=April 28, 2016|publisher=CNN}}</ref>

=== Garnering supporters from other candidates ===
With Rick Perry's exit from the race on September 11, David Johnson, one of Perry's backers in Iowa, reported being approached by Cruz Iowa state director Bryan English who asked if he would consider "another Texan for president". Additionally, Doug Deason, the son of a $5 million donor to Perry's super PAC, mentioned at the time of his dropping out that he had dined with Cruz "a few evenings ago" and was contacted by Cruz finance director Willie Langston.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/09/11/politics/rick-perry-2016-campaign-suspended/|title=Rick Perry drops out of presidential race|date=September 11, 2015|first=Theodore|last=Schleifer}}</ref>

After Scott Walker dropped out of the race on September 21, Cruz's campaign website announced its signing of all three of Walker's Georgia grassroots co-chairmen.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tedcruz.org/news/cruz-signs-up-all-three-walker-ga-statewide-co-chair/|title=Cruz Signs Up All Three Walker Ga Statewide Grassroots Co-Chairs|publisher=tedcruz.org}}</ref> In early November, Cruz's campaign was joined by former Walker Iowa strategist David Polyansky.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/gop-primaries/259459-cruz-picks-up-former-walker-strategist|title=Cruz picks up former Walker strategist|first=Jordan|last=Fabian|date=November 7, 2015|newspaper=The Hill}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/trackers/2015-11-06/former-scott-walker-strategist-joins-cruz-campaign|title=Former Scott Walker Strategist Joins Cruz Campaign|date=November 6, 2015|first=John|last=McCormick|publisher=Bloomberg}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.wdsu.com/politics/top-walker-strategist-joins-cruzs-campaign/36309948|title=Top Walker strategist joins Cruz's campaign|first=Theodore|last=Schleifer|date=November 6, 2015|publisher=wdsu.com}}</ref>

On September 28, Cruz released a video showing eight former supporters of [[Ron Paul]] who had begun backing him and announced that [[Bob Barr]] would chair the coalition of the Cruz campaign composed of libertarian-leaning Republicans. Katie Zezima of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' wrote that the former Ron Paul supporters would have been inclined to support his son Rand Paul's presidential campaign.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/09/29/ted-cruz-snags-former-ron-paul-supporters/|title=Ted Cruz snags former Ron Paul supporters|date=September 29, 2015|work=The Washington Post|first=Katie|last=Zezima}}</ref> On January 10, Sam Pimm, who worked for the Ben Carson campaign in New Hampshire, publicly announced he was withdrawing from Carson's campaign to support Cruz. Pimm expressed his belief that Carson could not win the nomination and viewed Cruz as having a higher probability of doing so.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/11/politics/ben-carson-ted-cruz-sam-pimm-defect/index.html|title=Ben Carson's New Hampshire PAC staff defects to Cruz|date=January 11, 2016|first=Tal|last=Kopan|publisher=CNN}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2016/01/sam-pimm-ted-cruz-217567|title=Former head of pro-Carson super PAC now supporting Cruz|first=Katie|last=Glueck|date=January 11, 2016|publisher=POLITICO}}</ref>

=== Relationship with Donald Trump ===
On August 10, Cruz cautioned rival Republican presidential candidates from dismissing Trump, citing that he was attracting large crowds and doing so would not help Republicans reclaim the White House.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2015/08/ted-cruz-foolish-for-gop-to-criticize-trump-121241|title=Cruz: 'Foolish' for GOP to criticize Trump|date=August 10, 2015|first=Katie|last=Glueck}}</ref>
On September 9, Cruz and Trump made a joint appearance at a rally opposing the [[2015 international nuclear agreement with Iran]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/09/09/politics/donald-trump-ted-cruz-2016-iran/index.html|title=Donald Trump, Ted Cruz join forces on Iran|date=September 9, 2015|publisher=CNN}}</ref> On November 17, Trump named Cruz when asked about a potential running mate, citing that he liked Cruz and that the senator had backed everything he had said.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/260492-trump-names-cruz-when-asked-about-vp-spot|title=Trump names Cruz when asked about VP spot|first=Mark|last=Hensch|newspaper=The Hill|date=November 17, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/trump-cruz-2016-ticket-gop-frontrunner-article-1.2438829|title=A Donald Trump-Ted Cruz 2016 ticket?

Tied with Marco Rubio, the poll was said to "poked a hole in the narrative" along with Ben Carson's support rising from 23% to 33% in a poll without Trump while Cruz only went up from 11% to 13%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/ted-cruz-donald-trump-theory-holes-2015-11|title=There's a problem with a common theory about Donald Trump and Ted Cruz|first=Maxwell|last=Tani|website=Business Insider|date=November 5, 2015}}</ref> The day following the Fox Business debate, Cruz outlined his differences from Trump.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2015/11/11/ted-cruz-contrasts-himself-with-donald-trump-let-me-point-out/|title=Ted Cruz Contrasts Himself With Donald Trump: 'Let Me Point Out…'|first=Oliver|last=Darcy|publisher=TheBlaze|date=November 11, 2015}}</ref> It was noted by commentators that although Cruz could gain the supporters of Trump should he drop out, there was also the possibility that he would not, which would lead to this effort being for naught.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/11/19/six-reasons-ted-cruz-is-in-trouble/|title=Six reasons Ted Cruz is in trouble|first=Jennifer|last=Rubin|work=The Washington Post|date=November 19, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.salon.com/2015/11/23/ted_cruz_has_a_donald_trump_problem_hes_waiting_for_a_trump_collapse_that_may_never_happen/|title=Ted Cruz has a Donald Trump problem: He's waiting for a Trump collapse that may never happen|first=Simon|last=Maloy|date=November 23, 2015|work=Salon}}</ref>

In private remarks to donors that were leaked, former President [[George W. Bush]] reportedly said that he did not like Cruz and found him to be opportunistic toward Trump, also stressing his belief that Cruz would be a "pretty formidable candidate" to Jeb Bush around the south. Though the Cruz campaign initially declined commenting on the rumors, Cruz released a public statement where he expressed his "great respect" for the former president and that he would "always be grateful to him" since he met his wife while working on his presidential campaign in 2000. Cruz reasoned that Bush's remarks were made to support his brother, the cause of his additional commenting on other candidates, though Cruz refused to "reciprocate" any attacks.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2015/10/jeb-bush-george-bush-donors-ted-cruz-214933|title=George W. Bush unleashes on Ted Cruz|date=October 19, 2015|publisher=Politico|first=Eli|last=Stokols}}</ref>

On December 11, during an appearance in Iowa, Trump admitted to liking Cruz, but mentioned that "not a lot of evangelicals come out of [[Cuba]]". The comment was seen as a reference to Cruz's father [[Rafael Cruz]], who had escaped from Cuba in his early adulthood and was viewed as Trump's first attack on Cruz.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/12/11/politics/donald-trump-ted-cruz-iowa-ethanol/index.html|title=Donald Trump launches first attacks against Ted Cruz|date=December 11, 2015|first=Theodore|last=Schleifer|publisher=CNN}}</ref> Following those remarks, on December 13, Trump went on to say that he had "far better judgement" than Cruz, citing his opposition to the [[Iraq War]] as an example.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/12/13/politics/donald-trump-ted-cruz-judgment/|title=Trump: 'I have far better judgment' than Cruz|date=December 13, 2015|first=Eugene|last=Scott|publisher=CNN}}</ref>

Trump was involved in questioning of Cruz's [[Natural born citizen clause|eligibility for the presidency]] in January and claimed he was trying to help Cruz, who argued that in politics, "it's fairly unusual for your opponents who are running for the same position to be actually trying to help you".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/campaign-2016-ted-cruz-hits-back-at-donald-trump-over-citizenship/|title=Ted Cruz hits back at Donald Trump over citizenship|publisher=CBS News|date=January 7, 2016|first=Major|last=Garrett}}</ref>  Cruz responded to Trump on January 12 with the assertion that he and [[Hillary Clinton]] knew each other well and that "it's interesting that Hillary Clinton's key supporters are doing everything they can to echo Donald's attacks on me."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/ted-cruz-donald-trump-canada-polls-2016-1|title=TED CRUZ: Polls show Donald Trump 'loses to Hillary — and loses by a pretty big margin'|date=January 12, 2016|first=Colin|last=Campbell}}</ref> After Cruz and Trump had several exchanges in the Fox Business debate on January 14, Trump said after the debate that he believed "the [[bromance]]" between the pair had ended.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/14/politics/republican-debate-2016-highlights/index.html?eref=rss_latest|title=GOP debate: Trump-Cruz 'bromance' is over|first=MJ|last=Lee|date=January 15, 2016|publisher=CNN}}</ref> On January 17, Trump acknowledged Cruz had been "so nice to me" before dubbing him "a nasty guy" and adding: "Nobody likes him, nobody in Congress likes him, nobody likes him anywhere once they get to know him."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2016/01/donald-trump-ted-cruz-nasty-guy-217896|title=Trump brands Cruz a 'nasty guy'|date=January 17, 2016|publisher=POLITICO|first=Isaac|last=Arnsdorf}}</ref> Cruz said on January 25 that Trump potentially could become "unstoppable" if he were to win Iowa, at the same time mentioning his substantial lead in New Hampshire and arguing that his campaign was the only one that could defeat Trump in Iowa.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/25/politics/ted-cruz-donald-trump-iowa/|title=Cruz: Trump 'could be unstoppable' if he wins Iowa|date=January 26, 2016|first=Jeremy|last=Diamond|publisher=CNN}}</ref>

With Trump declining to participate in the January 28 Fox News debate, Cruz invited him to a one-on-one debate, saying he would like to invite Trump if the latter was afraid of [[Megyn Kelly]] and launching a website seeking support of those in favor of a debate between the two candidates.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://money.cnn.com/2016/01/26/media/donald-trump-ted-cruz-debate/|title=Ted Cruz invites Donald Trump to go mano a mano in debate|date=January 27, 2016|publisher=CNN|first=Dylan|last=Byers}}</ref> Trump's campaign responded by saying Trump would debate Cruz if the two became the last candidates in the race.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/donald-trump-responds-ted-cruzs-debate-challenge/story?id=36537602|title=Donald Trump Responds to Ted Cruz's Debate Challenge|first=Jessica|last=Hopper|publisher=ABC News}}</ref> Cruz lampooned Trump at the Fox News debate, saying, "Now, secondly, let me say I'm a maniac and everyone on this stage is stupid, fat, and ugly.

The mailer was designed to look like an official document that accused the recipient of a "VOTING VIOLATION" for failure to turn out in past elections. The mailer was promptly condemned by Iowa Secretary of State [[Paul Pate]] who said the mailer "misrepresents the role of my office, and worse, misrepresents Iowa election law."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2016/01/ted-cruz-mailer-iowa-official-slams-218459#ixzz3yrYi5f6T/|title=Trump rips 'dishonest' and 'deceptive' Cruz mailer|publisher=POLITICO|date=January 31, 2016}}</ref>
