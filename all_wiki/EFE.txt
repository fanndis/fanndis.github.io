Agencia EFE is a news agency that covers all areas of information in the news media of the [[Newspaper|press]], [[radio]], [[television]] and [[Internet]]. It distributes around three million news per year, thanks to its 3,000 journalist from 60 nationalities, operating 24/7 from more than 180 cities in 120 countries and with four editing tables in three continents: [[Madrid]], [[Bogotá]], [[Cairo]] (Arabic), and [[Rio de Janeiro]] (Portuguese).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rtve.es/noticias/20090102/efe-cumple-70-anos-difundiendo-su-vision-espanola-actualidad/214509.shtml|title=Efe cumple 70 años difundiendo su visión española de la actualidad|date=2009-01-02|website=RTVE.es|language=es|access-date=2019-01-31|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180911191325/http://www.rtve.es/noticias/20090102/efe-cumple-70-anos-difundiendo-su-vision-espanola-actualidad/214509.shtml|archive-date=11 September 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

Employees in Spain are represented by several labor unions. EFE has about 40 employees in the [[United States]] who voted on 29 September 2005 to be represented by the [[News Media Guild]]. Workers ratified a first labor contract in December 2006, marking the first time the company had ever reached such an agreement outside Spain.

The agency organized the second News Agencies World Congress (NAWC) in 2007.<ref>{{cite news |title=News agencies embrace information technology |url=http://www.arabnews.com/news/480331 |accessdate=8 February 2014 |newspaper=[[Arab News]] |date=20 November 2013 |last=Hassan |first=Rashid |location=Riyadh |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140125093412/http://www.arabnews.com/news/480331 |archive-date=25 January 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref>

==History==
===Background===
The agency dates back to 1865, when the «Correspondents Center» was created - the first news agency in Spain - and promoted by journalist Nilo María Fabra. In 1870 a cooperation agreement was signed with the French agency [[Havas]]. With this agreement, the "Corresponsales Center" reserved the distribution rights in Spain of Havas' international news.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.agenciaefe.es/historia-de-efe/|title=Historia de EFE|website=Agencia EFE|language=es-ES|access-date=2019-01-31|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190201013529/https://www.agenciaefe.es/historia-de-efe/|archive-date=1 February 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

In 1919 the Fabra news agency was created, when Havas became part of the shareholding of the "Correspondents Center". Havas withdrew from the shareholding in 1926 at the same time that the Central Bank (a private entity), [[Santander Group|Santander Bank]] and Hispanic-American Bank entered into the partnership (these three banks merged at the end of the 20th century into [[Banco Santander Central Hispano]]).

===Foundation and early years===
EFE was officially founded in the city of [[Burgos]] in 1939. The city of Burgos was the headquarters of dictator [[Francisco Franco]].<ref name=RTVE>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rtve.es/noticias/20090102/desde-nacimiento-burgos-1939-hasta-era-digital/214687.shtml|title=Desde el nacimiento en Burgos en 1939 hasta la era digital|date=2009-01-02|website=RTVE.es|language=es|access-date=2019-01-31|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181002215158/http://www.rtve.es/noticias/20090102/desde-nacimiento-burgos-1939-hasta-era-digital/214687.shtml|archive-date=2 October 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> Its founder, Interior Minister [[Ramón Serrano Suñer]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2003/09/01/espana/1062432517.html|title=elmundo.es - Fallece Ramón Serrano Súñer, el ministro de Interior y de Asuntos Exteriores de Franco|website=www.elmundo.es|access-date=2019-01-31|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190201013227/https://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2003/09/01/espana/1062432517.html|archive-date=1 February 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> brother-in-law of Franco asked journalist Vicente Gallego (first director of the extinct ''Ya'' newspaper) to initiate the project.<ref name=CNICE>{{Cite web|url=http://recursos.cnice.mec.es/media/prensa/bloque7/pag5.html|title=MEDIA - Prensa > 7 Las agencias de información > 7.5 Efe, primera agencia de habla hispana|website=recursos.cnice.mec.es|access-date=2019-01-31|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190216063259/http://recursos.cnice.mec.es/media/prensa/bloque7/pag5.html|archive-date=16 February 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

On January 3, 1939, the Marquis of Torrehoyos Celedonio de Noriega Ruiz and journalist Luis Amato de Ibarrola - both legal representatives of the Fabra agency - declared before the notary José María Hortelano, that they have agreed to set up a commercial company of an anonymous nature, with the name of ''Agencia EFE S.A.'' The Fabra agency contributed with its rights and its name. In this way, the new agency could be admitted to the Club of the Allied Agencies, constituted at that time by some thirty agencies and whose statutes showed that only one agency per country can be a member of the association.<ref name=CNICE/><ref>{{Cite book|title=News Agencies from Pigeon to Internet|last=Shrivastava|first=K. M.|publisher=Sterling Publishers Pvt. Ltd.|year=2007|isbn=9781932705676|language=en}}</ref> In addition to the actions of the Fabra Agency to the new agency, technical and human elements of the missing agencies Faro and Febus were incorporated.<ref name=RTVE/>

===Controversy over the origin of the name===
On the grounds of the denomination "EFE" there is controversy. Contrary to some popular belief, it is not an [[acronym]]. The former president and director of the agency Luis María Anson said in an article published in the Ya newspaper that the name of EFE (pronunciation of letter F in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]) was due to the participation of the old agencies Fabra, Febus and Faro in the new agency.

However, Ramón Serrano Suñer acknowledged in a letter sent to Antonio Herrero Losada, director of the news agency Europa Press, that the EFE agency was named in this way because «F was the initial letter of Falange and Fe, which was the newspaper of Falange combat». He also added that «there was no mention that it was also a reason for the name of Efe that this letter was Franco's initial. This would come later.»<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://elpais.com/diario/1982/12/27/sociedad/409791603_850215.html|title=El nombre de la agencia Efe es la inicial de Falange, según Serrano Súñer|last=País|first=Ediciones El|date=1982-12-27|work=El País|access-date=2019-01-31|language=es|issn=1134-6582|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190201102955/https://elpais.com/diario/1982/12/27/sociedad/409791603_850215.html|archive-date=1 February 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

Herrero Losada, linked to the Fabra agency, denied Ansón recalling that since 1938, in the middle of a civil war, EFE was transmitting news to the media on the Francoist side, where editors of the Fabra agency were being persecuted for their activity. Previously, and another one of those mentioned, Febus, continued his informative service in the republican sector. For his part, José Antonio Giménez Arnáu assured that it was he who provided Serrano Suñer with the idea of creating the agency and drafted its statutes, that EFE had nothing to do with the initial of [[Falange]] or Franco, since according to some sources it occupied the building of the Editorial Spanish Falange, from whose initials it took the name, and that it had a proof that will only be known after its death something that happened three years after the controversy without any revelation.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://elpais.com/diario/1985/01/30/agenda/475887601_850215.html|title=José Antonio Giménez-Arnau y Gran, diplomático y escritor|last=País|first=Ediciones El|date=1985-01-30|work=El País|access-date=2019-01-31|language=es|issn=1134-6582|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190530062042/https://elpais.com/diario/1985/01/30/agenda/475887601_850215.html|archive-date=30 May 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

===First headquarters and services===
The first headquarters of Agencia EFE was installed on a floor of a modern building of six heights, inaugurated the previous year, which currently corresponds to number 10 -the 9th in the old numbering- of Victoria Street, [[Burgos]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.eldiario.es/economia/Burgos-homenaje-Agencia-EFE-nacio_0_233777450.html|title=Burgos rinde homenaje a la Agencia EFE en el lugar donde nació hace 75 años|last=EFE|website=eldiario.es|language=es|access-date=2019-01-31|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190201013514/https://www.eldiario.es/economia/Burgos-homenaje-Agencia-EFE-nacio_0_233777450.html|archive-date=1 February 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Its first President was Celedonio Noriega, Marquis of Torrehoyos and its first Managing Director Vicente Gállego Castro.

In 1940, EFE moved its headquarters to a house at number 5 on Ayala Street in [[Madrid]] and opened a delegation in [[Barcelona]]. The same year Jesús Pabón replaced Noriega as president and four years later, in 1944, the then-Deputy-Director Pedro Gómez Aparicio replaced Vicente Gállego in the direction of the agency.

In 1946, the Comtelsa economic service was created in collaboration, at 50%, with the US agency [[Reuters]]. It is known that, at least since this same year, Federico Vélez González, famous and prestigious photographer from Burgos, has been working as a graphic correspondent.

In 1951, EFE installed its first telephotography receiver. In 1958 Gómez Aparicio was replaced in his position by [[Manuel Aznar Zubigaray]], who will leave office 2 years later. The direction was assumed by the president and the executives of the company for 3 years, until in 1963 the journalist and correspondent abroad, Carlos Sentís, is appointed Managing Director.

===1960s to 1980s: Internationalization===
In 1965 it was open the [[Buenos Aires]] delegation, the first delegation for the [[Americas]] and the next year starts the foreign informative service to distribute news through [[Ibero-America]] and more delegations were open in other [[South America]]n countries. In 1967, Miguel Mateu Pla was appointed EFE President. In September of the following year Manuel Aznar will take care of the presidency and in 1969 Alexander Armesto is appointed Managing Director.

In 1968, EFE acquired the Fiel news agency and in 1969 started small news services in English and [[French language|French]]. In 1972, EFE joined forces with several [[Central America]]n media to create the Central American News Agency (ACAN), based in [[Panama]]. Its expansion through the Americas takes Agencia EFE in 1979 to enter like a full member in the [[Inter American Press Association]].

In February 1976, José María Alfaro Polanco is named president of EFE and in September the presidency is assumed by Luis María Anson, who will also be Director-General. That same year the first Stylebook of Agencia EFE for the homogeneous writing of the information services of all the world is published, under the direction and advising of the professor and academic [[Fernando Lázaro Carreter]].

In 1977, EFE moved its headquarters to number 32 Espronceda Street, Madrid. That same year, all the information services of the agency went on to use the name EFE, which until then was reserved for international information, so that the division of Cifra, Cifra-Gráfica and Alfil disappeared. That same year, the EFE Journalism Awards are also created, which in 1983 will be replaced by the King of Spain Awards.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://elpais.com/diario/1983/05/12/sociedad/421538409_850215.html|title=Convocados los Premios de Periodismo Rey de España|last=País|first=Ediciones El|date=1983-05-12|work=El País|access-date=2019-01-31|language=es|issn=1134-6582|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190511102633/https://elpais.com/diario/1983/05/12/sociedad/421538409_850215.html|archive-date=11 May 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

In 1981, Efe and the Institute for Ibero-American Cooperation will create the Department of Urgent Spanish (DEU) with the participation of philologists and prominent academics of the language, with the mission of ensuring the correct use of Spanish in its information services. In 1983, journalist Ricardo Utrilla was appointed President and CEO and an agreement was signed with the US agency [[UPI]] to promote the Radio department. The services "Great Signatures" and "End of Century Chronicles" are also created to distribute articles of outstanding intellectuals in [[Spain]] and [[Latin America]].

In 1984, EFE formally joins the [[European Pressphoto Agency]] (EPA), the first European telephotography agency,<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=https://elpais.com/sociedad/2009/01/02/actualidad/1230850801_850215.html|title=Reportaje {{!}} Agencia Efe: 70 años de noticias|last=ELPAÍS.com|date=2009-01-02|work=El País|access-date=2019-01-31|last2=EFE|language=es|issn=1134-6582|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190711131834/https://elpais.com/sociedad/2009/01/02/actualidad/1230850801_850215.html|archive-date=11 July 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> with 20% of the capital of the company. In 1986, EFE changed its logo<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://elpais.com/diario/1986/01/17/sociedad/506300404_850215.html|title=La agencia Efe estrena logotipo para hacer frente a su nueva etapa|last=País|first=Ediciones El|date=1986-01-17|work=El País|access-date=2019-01-31|language=es|issn=1134-6582|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190711132010/https://elpais.com/diario/1986/01/17/sociedad/506300404_850215.html|archive-date=11 July 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> and journalist Alfonso Sobrado Palomares was named President-Director-General.

In 1988, the Efe Data service was launched, the first Spanish news data bank, and in March of that same year the Efe Foundation was created to promote research, development and study of information and technology, as well as the granting of training scholarships for students in any of the branches of Information Sciences. In 1989, Efe began distributing its information services to its customers via satellites. This same year the 50th anniversary of the Agencia EFE was celebrated with an itinerant graphic exhibition called ''Ephemerides''. The Press Association of Madrid awards the Rodríguez Santamaría Award to Efe for its work.

== Urgent Spanish Department ==
In 1980 the Department of Urgent Spanish was created to combine criteria and norms, as well as to avoid linguistic dispersion and the indiscriminate use of [[neologism]]s in Spanish. The department is made up of [[Linguistics|linguists]] and [[philologists]] together with the Style Advisory Council, composed of members of the [[Spanish Royal Academy]], professors of Philology and journalists. Its main tool is the Urgent Spanish Manual (MEU), the Agencia EFE style manual, which is a very popular Spanish user manual. It began to be published in 1976.

In 2005, the Urgent Spanish Department was replaced by the Urgent Spanish Foundation, commonly known as [[Fundéu BBVA]].
