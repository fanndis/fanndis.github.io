Kaepernick played [[college football]] for the [[Nevada Wolf Pack football|Nevada Wolf Pack]], where he was named the [[Western Athletic Conference]] (WAC) Offensive Player of the Year twice and became the only player in [[NCAA Division I FBS]] history to amass 10,000 passing yards and 4,000 rushing yards in a career. After graduating, he was selected by the 49ers in the second round of the [[2011 NFL Draft]]. Kaepernick began his professional football career as a backup quarterback to [[Alex Smith]],  and became the 49ers' starter in the middle of the [[2012 San Francisco 49ers season|2012 season]] after Smith suffered a [[concussion]]. He then remained the team's starting quarterback for the rest of the season, leading the team to their first [[Super Bowl XLVII|Super Bowl]] appearance since [[Super Bowl XXIX|1994]]. During the [[2013 San Francisco 49ers season|2013 season]], his first full season as a starter, Kaepernick helped the 49ers reach the [[2013–14 NFL playoffs#NFC Championship Game: Seattle Seahawks 23, San Francisco 49ers 17|NFC Championship Game]]. Over the next three seasons, Kaepernick lost and won back his starting job, with the 49ers missing the playoffs for three years consecutively.

In the 49ers' third preseason game in [[2016 San Francisco 49ers season|2016]], Kaepernick sat during the playing of the [[The Star-Spangled Banner|U.S. national anthem]] prior to the game, rather than stand as is customary, as a protest against [[Racism in the United States|racial injustice]], police brutality and systematic oppression in the country.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000691077/article/colin-kaepernick-explains-why-he-sat-during-national-anthem |title=Colin Kaepernick explains why he sat during national anthem |work=NFL.com |access-date=August 20, 2017 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170820000932/http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000691077/article/colin-kaepernick-explains-why-he-sat-during-national-anthem |archive-date=August 20, 2017  }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/football/ct-colin-kaepernick-stand-national-anthem-20170302-story.html |title=Colin Kaepernick reportedly will now stand during the national anthem |last=Boren |first=Cindy |work=Chicago Tribune |access-date=August 20, 2017 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170820202254/http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/football/ct-colin-kaepernick-stand-national-anthem-20170302-story.html |archive-date=August 20, 2017  }}</ref> The following week, and throughout the regular season, Kaepernick kneeled during the anthem. The protests received highly polarized reactions, with some praising him and his stand against racism and others denouncing the protests.

Kaepernick withdrew the grievance in February 2019 after reaching a confidential settlement with the NFL. His protests received renewed attention in 2020 amid the [[George Floyd protests]] against police brutality and racism but, {{asof|2020|November|lc=yes}}, remains unsigned by any professional football team.
