'''The New York Times Building''' is a [[skyscraper]] at 620 Eighth Avenue, on the west side of [[Midtown Manhattan]], [[New York City]]. Its chief tenant is [[The New York Times Company]], [[publisher]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' as well as the ''[[International New York Times]]'', and other newspapers. The building is {{convert|1046|ft|m|1|abbr=on}} tall to its pinnacle, with a roof height of {{convert|748|ft|m|0|abbr=on}}, and contains 52 stories.

The building was erected from 2003 to 2007 as the Times' headquarters at a cost of $850 million. The structure was designed by [[Renzo Piano]] Building Workshop in association with [[FXFOWLE Architects]]. Construction was undertaken by a joint venture of The New York Times Company, [[Forest City Ratner]] ([[Forest City Enterprises]]'s New York subsidiary), and [[ING Group|ING Real Estate]]. {{As of|2018}}, The New York Times Building is tied with the [[Chrysler Building]] as the [[List of tallest buildings in New York City|eleventh-tallest building in the city]].

==History==
[[File:Nytimesbldg1904.jpg|left|thumb|Image of building taken in 1904]]

===Previous sites===
{{see also|New York Times Building (41 Park Row)#Previous buildings}}
The original newspaper headquarters in 1851 were at 113 Nassau Street, then a few years later at 138 Nassau Street. In 1858, the Times moved to a five-story edifice at [[41 Park Row#Previous buildings|41 Park Row]]; thirty years later, partially in response to [[New York Tribune Building|a new tower]] erected by the competing ''[[New-York Tribune]]'', it commissioned [[41 Park Row|a new 13-story building at the same site]], one that remains in use by [[Pace University]] with some modifications.<ref name="nyt20011114"/>

In 1904, again partially in response to the [[Herald Square]] headquarters of the ''[[New York Herald]]'', the paper moved to perhaps its most famous location, the [[One Times Square|Times Tower]], on the site of the [[Pabst Hotel]]. The name of the surrounding area changed from [[Longacre Square]] to [[Times Square]]. The paper outgrew the slender tower within a decade and, in 1913, moved into the Times Annex at [[229 West 43rd Street]], where it remained for almost a century.<ref name="nyt20011114">{{Cite news|last=Dunlap|first=David W.|date=November 14, 2001|title=150th Anniversary: 1851-2001; Six Buildings That Share One Story|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/11/14/news/150th-anniversary-1851-2001-six-buildings-that-share-one-story.html|access-date=July 15, 2020|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>

===New building ===

[[File:NY Height Comparison.png|thumb|left|alt=Height comparison of New York City buildings|Height comparison of New York City buildings, with the New York Times Building on the right]]

====Construction====
The project was announced on December 13, 2001, as a 52-story tower on the east side of [[Eighth Avenue (Manhattan)|Eighth Avenue]] between 40th and 41st Street across from the [[Port Authority of New York & New Jersey Bus Terminal]]. The project, in conjunction with the [[Hearst Tower (Manhattan)|Hearst Tower]], represented the further westward expansion of Midtown along Eighth Avenue, a corridor that had seen no construction since the 1989 completion of [[One Worldwide Plaza]]. The new building—called by many New Yorkers "The New Times Tower"—also kept the paper in the [[Times Square]] area, its namesake.

The site for the building was obtained by the [[Empire State Development Corporation]] (ESDC) through [[eminent domain]]. With a mandate to acquire and redevelop [[urban decay|blighted]] properties in Times Square, ten buildings were condemned by the ESDC and purchased from their owners. Some owners sued, asserting that the area was no longer blighted, but lost in court.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Dunlap|first=David W.|date=October 25, 2001|title=Blight to Some Is Home to Others; Concern Over Displacement by a New Times Building|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/10/25/nyregion/blight-some-home-others-concern-over-displacement-new-times-building.html|access-date=July 15, 2020|issn=0362-4331}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news | last=Moses | first=Paul | title=The Paper of Wreckage | newspaper=[[The Village Voice]] | date=June 17, 2002 | url=http://www.villagevoice.com/news/0225,moses,35773,1.html|access-date=July 15, 2020}}</ref> Once the {{convert|80000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} site was assembled, it was leased to The New York Times Company and Forest City Ratner for $85.6 million over 99 years (considerably below market value).<ref name=NYTHQDeal>{{Cite news|last=Bagli|first=Charles V.|date=February 28, 2001|title=Deal Reached to Acquire Land for The Times's Headquarters|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/02/28/nyregion/deal-reached-to-acquire-land-for-the-times-s-headquarters.html|access-date=July 15, 2020|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> Additionally, The New York Times Company received $26.1 million in tax breaks.<ref name="NYTHQDeal" />

====Occupancy====

Shortly after completion, in 2009 the ''Times'' sold their ownership stake in the tower's leasehold to [[W. P. Carey]] for $225 million.<ref name="TRD">{{cite news |url=https://therealdeal.com/2018/02/01/new-york-times-will-buy-back-its-hq-leasehold/ |title=New York Times will buy back its HQ leasehold |work=[[The Real Deal (magazine)|The Real Deal]]|date=February 1, 2018}}</ref> In exchange, the ''Times'' would lease back their floors for $24 million a year for 10 years, a price far below the market value of the space.

==Design==
The tower was designed by [[Renzo Piano]] Building Workshop and [[FXFOWLE Architects]], with [[Gensler]] providing interior design. The lighting design for the building's nighttime identity was designed by the Office for Visual Interaction Inc. The tower rises {{convert|748|ft|m|0}} from the street to its roof, with the exterior curtain wall extending {{convert|92|ft|m|0}} higher to {{convert|840|ft|m|0}}, and a mast rising to {{convert|1046|ft|m|1}}.<ref name=skyscraperCenter>{{cite web |url=https://skyscrapercenter.com/building/new-york-times-tower/423 |title=New York Times Tower – The Skyscraper Center |work=Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat}}</ref><ref name="Emporis">{{cite web | publisher=Emporis | title=New York Times Tower | url=http://www.emporis.com/building/newyorktimestower-newyorkcity-ny-usa | access-date=July 15, 2020}}</ref> {{As of|2018}}, The New York Times Building is the [[List of tallest buildings in New York City|eleventh-tallest building in the city]], tied with the [[Chrysler Building]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.amny.com/real-estate/tallest-buildings-in-nyc-1.9216740|title=12 tallest skyscrapers in New York City|work=am New York|access-date=February 20, 2018|language=en}}</ref>

The [[steel-framed building]], [[cruciform]] in plan, has a screen of {{frac|1|5|8}}" (41.3&nbsp;mm) ceramic rods mounted on the exterior of the glass curtain wall on the east, west and south facades. The rod spacing increases from the base to the top, adding transparency as the building rises. The steel framing and bracing is exposed at the four corner "notches" of the building.<ref name="gostructural_20040615">{{Cite news | title=A statement in steel: The New York Times Building | newspaper=GoStructural.com | date=June 15, 2004 | url=http://www.gostructural.com/article.asp?id=603 | accessdate=November 29, 2007}}</ref>

=== Sustainability ===
The new building is promoted as a [[Sustainability|green]] structure. The design incorporates numerous environmentally sustainable features for increased energy efficiency. The double-skin curtain wall, automated louver shading system, dimmable lighting system, [[Underfloor air distribution|underfloor air distribution system]] and [[cogeneration]] are the main sustainable design features.<ref name="sciencebeat_20040217">{{Cite news | title=The New York Times Building: Designing for Energy Efficiency Through Daylighting Research | newspaper=Science Beat | date=February 17, 2004 | url=http://www.lbl.gov/Science-Articles/Archive/sb-EETD-NYT-building.html | accessdate=November 29, 2007}}</ref><ref name="CTBUH Technical Paper">{{cite journal |last=Jambhekar |first=S.|date=October 10, 2004|title=Times Square Skyscrapers: Sustainability Reaching New Heights |url=http://ctbuh.org/Portals/0/Repository/Jambhekar_2004_TimesSquareSkyscrapers.587097b5-3224-45e1-8b38-fb1110b12bf4.pdf|publisher=CTBUH Conference, Seoul|accessdate=October 10, 2004}}</ref>

====Double-skin curtain wall====

The use of floor-to-ceiling glass maximizes light and views for people inside and outside the building. The horizontal white ceramic rods on the building facade, which are spaced to allow occupants to have unobstructed views while both seated and standing, act as an aesthetic veil and a sun shade. They are made of aluminum silicate, an extremely dense and high-quality ceramic chosen for its durability and cost-effectiveness. Glazed with a finish similar to the material used on terracotta to reflect light, self-clean, and resist weather, the rods change color with the sun and weather. Additionally, the automated louver shades move in response to the position of the sun and inputs from sensors, blocking light to reduce glare or allowing it to enter at times of less direct sunlight. The movable shades reduce energy consumption about 13% by reducing solar heat gain by 30%.<ref name="sciencebeat_20040217" /><ref name="CTBUH Technical Paper"/>

====Lighting system====

In a normal office building, lights usually consume about 44% of total energy. The New York Times Building uses less, because its design, lighting, and shading systems allow the sun to be the main source of light. Each of the more than 18,000 [[electrical ballast]]s in the lighting system contains a computer chip, allowing each room's lights to brighten or dim depending on whether a room is occupied and how bright the sun is.<ref>{{Cite web|title=New York Times Building |publisher= Greenhome NYC|url=https://greenhomenyc.org/building/new-york-times-building/|access-date=2020-07-16|website=greenhomenyc.org}}</ref>

====Underfloor air distribution====

The New York Times Company utilizes an [[Underfloor air distribution|underfloor air distribution system]] (UFAD) which strives for better [[indoor air quality]], [[thermal comfort]] as well as energy saving. The conditioned air from the air handler is delivered through an air highway system that circumnavigates the service core and then into the six zoned off underfloor low pressure zones for distribution across the floor plate to all floor diffusers. Around each perimeter a series of fan power boxes control the temperature in the space. If heating is required then the fans turn on delivering heat via a hot water coil. In cooling mode, the fans operate to give increased ventilation around the perimeter spaces. Fresh air is supplied by two air handling units on the 28th floor sending fresh treated outside air to each floor where a constant volume VAV controls the amount of air entering the system. The air is then conditioned for proper cooling and humidity before being sent to the air highway. The New York Times Building also benefits from other general UFAD advantages. In the open plan office space that was implemented in occupied space from 2nd to 21st floors to enhance daylighting and outdoor views, the system provides flexibility to place the required equipment anywhere on the raised integrated service plenum. When departments or occupants needed to be reconfigured, the raised floor also enables maintenance to carry out changes at relatively lower expense.<ref name="POE" /><ref name="UFAD">{{cite report |title=Underfloor Air Distribution in a Commercial High Rise:The New York Times Headquarters |publisher=National Conference on Building Commissioning |date=May 2007| url=http://www.bcxa.org/ncbc/2007/proceedings/English_NCBC2007.pdf|access-date=July 15, 2020}}</ref>

====Cogeneration on site====

The New York Times Building incorporates a [[cogeneration]] plant to supply its 24-7 operation and 40% of the power used. Located in a mechanical room at the far end of the podium's top floor, the plant consists of two natural gas fired reciprocating engine driven generators with a total generating capacity of 1.5 MW of electrical power. It recovers the heat produced by combustion and converts the heat into usable energy in the form of hot water. The recovered hot water serves as the building's heating loop to provide warmth during the winter and functions as a refrigeration machine to provide cooling during the summer. The power from the grid is solely used by the building as a backup source.<ref name="CTBUH Technical Paper" />

====Other features====

In excess of 95% of the structural steel was recycled. The building, like many in [[Midtown Manhattan]], has no on-site parking, with most employees arriving by [[public transit]] (the [[New York City Subway]]'s [[Times Square–42nd Street/Port Authority Bus Terminal station|Times Square station]] and the [[Port Authority Bus Terminal]] are in the immediate vicinity).<ref>{{cite web | last=Naparstek | first=Aaron | title=New York Times Employees Say Renzo Forgot the Bike Parking | website=Streetsblog New York City | date=December 6, 2007 | url=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2007/12/06/new-york-times-employees-say-renzo-forgot-the-bike-parking/ | access-date=July 15, 2020}}</ref>

====Overall performance====

A team of researchers at the [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory|Lawrence Berkeley National Lab]] and [[Center for the Built Environment]] monitored the building's performance for a year and compared the results with buildings that meet with the standard building efficiency codes. They found that the New York Times Building significantly reduced annual electricity, cut heating energy use by more than 50% and decrease the peak electric demand as well. "It is essential to start with a sound, integrated building design, and then to pay attention to details such as procurement of building equipment, and verifying the proper performance of the equipment after it is installed. The Times Company did its homework in 2004, well before construction began on the building, evaluating and optimizing the shading and daylighting technologies," concluded the Berkeley researchers.<ref name="POE">{{cite report |title=A Post-Occupancy Monitored Evaluation of the Dimmable Lighting, Automated Shading, and Underfloor Air Distribution System in The New York Times Building |publisher=Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and University of California Berkeley|date=January 2013| url=http://buildings.lbl.gov/sites/all/files/lbnl-6023e.pdf|access-date=July 15, 2020}}</ref><ref name="Why the New York Times Building Is Saving So Much Energy">{{Cite news | title=Why the New York Times Building Is Saving So Much Energy | date=2013 | url=http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/look-at-how-much-energy-the-new-york-times-building-saved|access-date=July 15, 2020}}</ref>

==Climbers==

In mid-2008, three men illegally climbed the external facade of The New York Times Building within a month of each other, the first two on the same day; the three climbers were not associated with one another.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Eligon|first=John|date=December 1, 2008|title=Times Building Climber Is Sentenced to Three Days of Community Service|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/02/nyregion/02climber.html|access-date=July 15, 2020|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> On June 5, 2008, professional climber [[Alain Robert]], dubbed "The French Spiderman", climbed the north side of The New York Times Building. He was able to scale the building from first floor all the way to the roof. During his climb, Robert attached a fluorescent green neon sign to the building that read "Global warming kills more people than a 9/11 every week". Robert also wore a [[t-shirt]] promoting the website "The Solution is Simple". Robert was met on the roof by the NYPD emergency service unit team where he was put in a harness to ensure he did not fall and placed under arrest.<ref>{{cite news |work=[[Reuters]] |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-french-spiderman/french-spiderman-scales-new-york-times-building-idUSN0534354520080605 |title=French 'Spiderman' scales New York Times building |first=Marcy |last=Nicholson |date=June 5, 2008 |accessdate=June 5, 2008}}</ref><ref name="nyt20080606"/> Later that day, a second climber scaled the western face of the building.<ref>{{cite news|title=2nd Man Climbs West Side Building in Copycat Stunt |work=[[New York Post]] |date=June 4, 2008 |url=http://www.nypost.com/seven/06042008/news/regionalnews/2nd_man_climbs_west_side_building_in_cop_114131.htm |accessdate=September 4, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090414202655/http://www.nypost.com/seven/06042008/news/regionalnews/2nd_man_climbs_west_side_building_in_cop_114131.htm |archivedate=April 14, 2009 }}</ref><ref name="nyt20080606">{{Cite news|last=Barron|first=James|date=June 6, 2008|title=2 Men Scale New York Times Building Hours Apart|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/06/nyregion/06climber.html|access-date=July 15, 2020|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> He also was arrested for climbing the building facade after reaching the roof.

The third climber in mid-2008 was David Malone, 29, from [[Connecticut]], who also scaled the west side of the building on July 9, 2008. Unlike the two previous climbers, Malone did not attempt to make it to the roof. He hung a banner around the fifth floor upon the first "T" of The New York Times sign, that had a picture of [[Osama Bin Laden]] holding Bush like a [[puppet]]—"Bin Laden's Plan" (the title of his book and website). He then climbed higher, stopping at the 11th floor, and remained hanging on the building for four hours before being arrested. Malone said he was protesting Al Qaeda's "crusader baiting", and "intentional provocation of the U.S."<ref>{{cite news|last=Cruz|first=Wil|last2=Coffey|first2=Jill|title=Times climb – again!
