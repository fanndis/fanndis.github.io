The second incarnation of the '''CBS Corporation''' (the first being a short-lived rename of the [[Westinghouse Electric Corporation]]) was an American [[Multinational corporation|multinational]] [[media conglomerate]] with interests primarily in [[commercial broadcasting]], [[publishing]], and [[television]] [[Production company|production]] which was formed as the legal successor to the [[Viacom (1952–2006)|first incarnation of Viacom]] on January 1, 2006. It was one of two companies which succeeded the first Viacom, alongside the [[Viacom (2005–2019)|second incarnation of Viacom]]; both were controlled by [[National Amusements]], a theater company controlled by billionaire [[Sumner Redstone]]. The spin-off was structured so that CBS Corporation would be the legal successor to the first Viacom, with the second Viacom being an entirely separated company.<ref name="autogenerated2">{{cite web|url=http://www.cbscorporation.com/media/pdf/CleanShareholderletterS.pdf |title=Certain Federal Income Tax Information Regarding the Separation of Viacom Inc. |format=PDF |date=January 12, 2006 |publisher=CBS Corporation|accessdate=November 30, 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080625000756/http://www.cbscorporation.com/media/pdf/CleanShareholderletterS.pdf |archivedate = June 25, 2008}}</ref>

== Background ==
The [[Viacom (1952–2006)|first incarnation of Viacom]] was created in 1952 as the television [[Broadcast syndication|syndication]] division of [[CBS]], and was spun off in 1971. However, in 1999, Viacom acquired its former parent, by this time also named CBS Corporation, formerly [[Westinghouse Electric Corporation (1886)|Westinghouse Electric]]. The prior CBS Corporation also owned [[Country Music Television|CMT]] and [[Spike (TV channel)|The Nashville Network]] (now [[Paramount Network]]), which remained Viacom properties after the 2005 split, but the prior CBS did not own [[UPN]], Showtime, Paramount Television, Paramount Parks, or Simon and Schuster.

== History ==
{{ViacomCBS evolution}}

=== Early history ===
In March 2005, Viacom announced plans of looking into splitting the company into two publicly traded companies, amid issues of the stock price stagnating (although it was alleged that another main force behind the split was the [[Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show controversy]]{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}, which led to MTV not being allowed to produce any more halftime shows, they had also produced the show for [[Super Bowl XXXV]], the first Super Bowl CBS aired since regaining [[NFL]] rights and becoming MTV's corporate sibling).

[[File:Viacom-old.svg|thumb|Old separate [[Viacom (1952–2006)|Viacom]] logo (1990–2006)]]
On June 14, 2005, the Viacom board of directors approved the split of the company into two firms.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/15/business/media/15viacom.html|title=viacom board agrees to split of company|last=Fabrikant |first=Geraldine|date=June 15, 2005|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|accessdate=July 28, 2014}}</ref> The CBS Corporation name would be revived for one of the companies, to be headed by longtime television executive (and Viacom co-President) [[Les Moonves]], and would include the namesake television network [[CBS]], [[UPN]], Infinity Broadcasting, Viacom Outdoor, [[Showtime Networks]], and Paramount's television studio.

The split was structured such that [[Viacom (2005–2019)|the second Viacom]] was spun off from the first Viacom, which was renamed CBS Corporation. In a sense, this was a repeat of the 1971 spinoff. However, in this case, CBS retained virtually all of the prior firm's broadcast television assets, including its various syndication companies.

With the split, the two companies began trading on the [[New York Stock Exchange]] on January 3, 2006. Investors anticipated Viacom benefiting from the split, but instead, it dropped approximately 20 percent, while CBS Corporation rose 9 percent, that same year, [[Paramount Parks]] became a wholly owned theme park unit of CBS Corporation.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/22/business/media/22viacom.html?pagewanted=all|title=a surprise after the split: Viacom struggles as CBS holds its own|last=Fabrikant|first=Geraldine|date=July 22, 2006|newspaper=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|accessdate=July 28, 2014}}</ref>

=== Subsequent developments ===
Announced in January 2006, CBS and [[DIC Entertainment]] signed a multi-year deal in which DIC bought the Saturday morning airtime as "CBS's Saturday Morning Secret Slumber Party". In June 2006, DiC added a production partner AOL's KOL. Thus, this block would be called "[[Cookie Jar TV|KOL's Saturday Morning Secret Slumber Party on CBS]]".<ref>{{cite web|first=John |last=Consoli |url=http://www.mediaweek.com/mw/news/networktv/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1002725721 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060713195740/http://www.mediaweek.com/mw/news/networktv/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1002725721 |archivedate=July 13, 2006 |title=DIC, KOL to Produce On CBS |date=June 21, 2006 |publisher=MediaWeek |accessdate=November 30, 2008}}</ref>

[[File:The CW.svg|right|200px|thumb|The CW logo]]
On January 24, 2006, CBS Corporation and [[Warner Bros.]] announced that they were to create a new broadcast network, [[The CW]]. The network officially debuted on September 18, 2006. The network formally debuted on September 20 with the 2-hour premiere of [[America's Next Top Model]]. The network is the result of a merger of [[The WB]] (a Warner Bros. holding) and UPN (a CBS Corporation holding). CBS Corporation and [[WarnerMedia|Time Warner]] each own 50% of the network. [[Tribune Broadcasting]] (which previously owned a 25% stake on The WB) and CBS Corporation will contribute its stations as new network affiliates.

Three days after the announcement of The CW, on January 27, CBS announced that it was selling its Paramount Parks division. On May 23, 2006, CBS Corporation sold Paramount Parks to the [[Cedar Fair Entertainment Company]]. With this acquisition, Cedar Fair became the third-largest theme park operator.<ref>{{cite news|title=CBS to Sell Amusement Parks to Cedar Fair|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/23/business/23park.html|work=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=May 23, 2006}}</ref> On June 30, 2006, Cedar Fair announced that it has completed its acquisition of Paramount Parks from CBS Corporation in a cash transaction valued at US$1.24 billion.  The transaction included a 10-year license that allowed Cedar Fair to use the Paramount name in the parks through the 2017 season.<ref>{{cite news|author=Cedar Fair, L.P.|title=Cedar Fair, L.P.

CBS is swapping the stations and US$170 million in cash for 7.59 million shares of CBS common stock held by Liberty Media.

On February 26, 2007, CBS announced that it will invest in Electric Sheep, which is a virtual world content developer. CBS hired Electric Sheep to develop some projects, including the creation of "The L-Word in Second Life". CBS also shot a commercial within the virtual world [[Second Life]] to promote its show ''[[Two and a Half Men]]''. Another project that Electric Sheep was working on for CBS was a ''[[Star Trek]]''-themed area in Second Life. By investing in Electric Sheep, CBS hoped to expand its activity "beyond the living room".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usb4ever.com/cbs-investment-p.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070726224522/http://www.usb4ever.com/cbs-investment-p.html|archivedate=July 26, 2007|title=CBS Invests in Virtual World Content Developer}}</ref> On March 20, CBS/CSTV had acquired [[MaxPreps]], an online high school sports network.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cbscorporation.com/news-article.php?id=425 |title=CBS Corporation acquires MaxPreps, the leading nationwide high school sports network online; business to be part of CSTV: College Sports Television |date=March 20, 2007 |publisher=CBS Corporation |accessdate=January 2, 2012}}</ref> On April 12, CBS Corporation announced the creation of the CBS Interactive Audience Network.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cbscorporation.com/news-article.php?id=373 |title=CBS Corporation announces the creation of the CBS Interactive Audience Network |date=April 12, 2007 |publisher=CBS Corporation |accessdate=January 2, 2012}}</ref> On May 30, 2007, [[CBS Interactive]] bought [[Last.fm]] for £140 million.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/6701863.stm Music site Last.fm bought by CBS], ''BBC'', May 30, 2007</ref>
