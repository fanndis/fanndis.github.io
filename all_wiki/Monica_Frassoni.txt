==Biography==
Monica Frassoni is a Political Science graduate from the [[University of Florence]] Cesare Alfieri. Her political career started in 1983, when she became actively involved in the [[European Federalist Movement]]. In 1987, she moved to Brussels, having been elected as Secretary General of the European organisation of [[Young European Federalists]] (“JEF Europe”).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.jef.eu/about-jef/history/|title=JEF Europe: History|website=jef.eu|access-date=2017-10-02}}</ref>

Her involvement in youth policies continued when she was appointed president of the European Co-Coordinating Bureau of Youth NGOs, position she held from 1991 to 1993.

'''1990-2009: the European Parliament years '''

In 1990, Monica Frassoni started working for the [[Greens–European Free Alliance|Greens/EFA]] Group in the [[European Parliament]] in charge of constitutional matters, rule of law, procedures and immunities. In that capacity, she worked closely with Adelaide Aglietta, Alexander Langer and Paul Lannoye and was heavily involved in the implementation of the European Parliament's new legislative competences, subsequent to the institutional reforms culminating in the Treaties of Maastricht, Amsterdam and Nice. In 1999, she was elected as a member of the European Parliament for her first mandate with [[Ecolo]], becoming the first non-Belgian politician to be elected in a Belgian political party and the first Italian national to be elected abroad. During her first legislation, she was active in constitutional affairs and human rights issues, closely following the negotiations for enlarging the EU to include Cyprus and for reform of the EU. She also became involved in several specific environmental issues with a clear European dimension in terms of EU law, such as protection of the Ebro River in Spain, high-speed infrastructures like the Lyon-Turin tunnel, waste in Naples, etc.

From 2002 to 2009, she was co-chair alongside [[Daniel Cohn-Bendit]] of the [[Greens–European Free Alliance|Green/EFA group]] which by then had grown into the fourth largest group in the European Parliament in terms of number of MEPs. To this day, the Group includes Green, regionalist and progressive political parties.

In June 2004, Monica Frassoni was re-elected for a second term with the Italian [[Federation of the Greens]]. During this period, she was a member of the Legal Affairs Committee and a substitute member of the Committees on Constitutional Affairs and on Environment, Public Health and Food Safety. She was part of the delegation for relations with Mercosur, the delegation for relations with Iran, and the Parliamentary Assembly of the Mediterranean. For three years, she was also draftsperson for the yearly report of the European Parliament on the implementation of the EU law, thus following closely the review of infringement procedures carried out by the European Commission.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?type=IM-PRESS&reference=20080219IPR21737&format=XML&language=EN|title=Better use of Community law infringement procedures against Member States|website=europarl.europa.eu|language=en|access-date=2017-10-02}}</ref> She was also a member of the European Parliament negotiating team in the working group on the reform of the Parliament, led by [[Dagmar Roth-Behrendt]], and on the Interinstitutional Agreement on Better Law-making.

Monica Frassoni was appointed by former Commissioner on External Relations and European Neighbourhood Policy, [[Benita Ferrero-Waldner]], as chief of the European Union Election observation mission to Bolivia for the Constituent Assembly Elections in July 2016, and to Venezuela for the presidential elections in December that same year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://eeas.europa.eu/headquarters/headquarters-homepage/26165/eu-election-observation-mission-bolivia-2006_fi|title=EU election observation mission to Bolivia in 2006 - EEAS - European Commission|website=EEAS|language=fi|access-date=2017-10-02}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://eeas.europa.eu/headquarters/headquarters-homepage/26227/eu-election-observation-mission-venezuela-2006_en|title=EU election observation mission to Venezuela in 2006 - EEAS - European External Action Service - European Commission|website=EEAS - European External Action Service|language=en|access-date=2017-10-02}}</ref>

In 2007, she was her group's candidate for the presidency of the European Parliament, standing against Hans-Gert Pöttering, on a pro-change, Green and anti-Grand Coalition programme.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//TEXT+CRE+20070116+ITEM-002+DOC+XML+V0//EN&language=en&query=INTERV&detail=2-008|title=Debates - Tuesday, 16 January 2007 - Announcement of the candidates for election to the office of President|website=europarl.europa.eu|language=en|access-date=2017-10-02}}</ref> She secured about three times the number of voters of her own group.

From 2003, Monica Frassoni was a member of the executive and later Vice-Chair of the Parliamentary Network on the World Bank and International Monetary Fund.

'''2009–Present'''

In 2009, following the end of her second mandate in the European Parliament, she was elected a co-chair of the European Green Party, being re-elected in 2012 and 2015.

She concluded her mandate in November 2019.

In 2013, she was heavily involved in the organisation of the first pan-European Green Primary campaign for the nomination of the Green candidate to the EU-Commission Presidency. This campaign was an innovative pilot project involving national Green parties which aimed at bringing the discussion on who leads the EU closer to the citizens and at "Europeanising" the elections for the European Parliament in 2014.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://one-europe.net/initiative/the-green-primary-you-decide-europe-1|title=The Green Primary - You decide Europe|work=OneEurope|access-date=2017-10-02|language=en}}</ref>

In 2010, she was nominated by the [[Foreign Policy]] magazine as one of the [[FP Top 100 Global Thinkers#2011 list|Top 100 Global Thinkers list]], along with [[Marina Silva]], [[Cécile Duflot]] and [[Renate Kunast]], for "taking Green mainstream".

In 2010, she co-funded and was appointed President of the European Alliance to Save Energy, a multistakeholder, business-led advocacy organisation aiming at promoting strong and ambitious EU-wide regulation on energy and at thus strengthening policies for the decarbonisation of EU-economy.

In 2011, she joined the board of the European Centre for Electoral Support, and in 2013, became president of the board, replacing the late ex-president and founder Abbot Apollinaire Malou Malou. ECES is a not-for-profit private foundation, headquartered in Brussels, which aims at promoting sustainable democratic development through the provision of advisory services and operational support to electoral stakeholders throughout the electoral cycle. From 2012 to the present day, ECES has signed 71 contracts in 39 countries, mainly in Africa and mostly with the European Commission and Member States.

In 2016, she was included by [[EURACTIV]] among the 40 policy experts with influence in EU energy efficiency policy.

In 2018 and 2019, she was appointed Special Ambassador of the EU Sustainable Energy Week.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.eusew.eu/|title=EU Sustainable Energy Week}}</ref>

In October 2018, she was elected local councilor for the [[Ecolo]]-Groen<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://bx1.be/ixelles/communales-2018-voici-premiers-resultats-elections-a-ixelles/|title=Communales 2018 : Ecolo-Groen mène largement les débats à Ixelles et revendique le poste de bourgmestre|date=2018-10-14|website=BX1|language=fr-FR|access-date=2019-11-05}}</ref> list in [[Ixelles]] ([[Brussels]]), under the mayorship of [[Christos Doulkeridis]] ([[Ecolo]]).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ixelles.be/site/10-Composition|title=Composition {{!}} Ixelles|website=ixelles.be|access-date=2019-11-05}}</ref>

Central to her current political work is the goad of a "Federal Union", to be supported by a radical reorientation of EU policies and investment priorities towards a real "Green New Deal", the elimination of the powers to veto for each EU Member State; a more robust role for the European Parliament, to be elected partly through transnational electoral list, and a more substantial EU budget. A deeply reformed EU can have the right dimensions and capacity to face today's global challenges, in particular the fight against climate change, inequality, intolerance and the progressive weakening of democracy and freedoms in the EU.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://europeangreens.eu/news/jean-claude-juncker%E2%80%99s-white-paper-future-europe-five-scenarios-not-make-choice|title=Jean-Claude Juncker's white paper on the future of Europe: five scenarios not to make a choice|website=European Greens|language=en|access-date=2017-10-02}}</ref> Her work in the energy and electoral assistance areas are closely linked to this idea of promoting and strengthening European democracy.
