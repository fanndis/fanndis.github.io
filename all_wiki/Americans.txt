===Some other race===
{{See also|Multiracial Americans}}

According to the [[2010 United States Census]], 6.2% or 19,107,368 Americans chose to self-identify with the "some other race" category, the third most popular option. Also, 36.7% or 18,503,103 Hispanic/Latino Americans chose to identify as [[Race and ethnicity in the United States#Some other race|some other race]] as these Hispanic/Latinos may feel the U.S. Census does not describe their European and American Indian ancestry as they understand it to be.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/briefs/c2010br-02.pdf|title=Overview of Race and Hispanic Origin: 2010}}</ref>
A significant portion of the Hispanic and Latino population self-identifies as [[Mestizo]], particularly the Mexican and Central American community. [[Mestizo]] is not a [[Race and ethnicity in the United States Census|racial category in the U.S. Census]], but signifies someone who has both European and American Indian ancestry.

A [[national personification]] is an [[anthropomorphism]] of a nation or its people; it can appear in both [[editorial cartoon]]s and [[propaganda]].

[[Uncle Sam]] is a national personification of the United States and sometimes more specifically of the [[American government]], with the first usage of the term dating from the [[War of 1812]]. He is depicted as a stern elderly white man with white hair and a [[goatee]] beard, and dressed in clothing that recalls the design elements of the [[flag of the United States]] – for example, typically a [[top hat]] with red and white stripes and white stars on a blue band, and red and white striped trousers.

[[Columbia (name)|Columbia]] is a poetic name for the Americas and the feminine personification of the United States of America, made famous by African-American poet [[Phillis Wheatley]] during the [[American Revolutionary War]] in 1776. It has inspired the names of many persons, places, objects, institutions, and companies in the [[Western Hemisphere]] and beyond, including the [[District of Columbia]], the seat of government of the United States.

[[American English|English]] is the de facto [[national language]]. Although there is no [[official language]] at the federal level, some laws—such as [[United States nationality law#Naturalization|U.S. naturalization requirements]]—standardize English. In 2007, about 226&nbsp;million, or 80% of the population aged five years and older, spoke only English at home. [[Spanish in the United States|Spanish]], spoken by 12% of the population at home, is the second most common language and the most widely taught second language.<ref name="USCB Lang">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/compendia/statab/2010/tables/10s0053.pdf|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|work=Statistical Abstract of the United States 2010|title=Table 53—Languages Spoken at Home by Language: 2007|access-date=September 21, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100327063255/http://www.census.gov/compendia/statab/2010/tables/10s0053.pdf|archive-date=March 27, 2010|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.adfl.org/resources/enrollments.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19991127104400/http://www.adfl.org/resources/enrollments.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=November 27, 1999 |title=Foreign Language Enrollments in United States Institutions of Higher Learning |date=Fall 2002 |publisher=MLA |access-date=October 16, 2006 }}</ref> Some Americans advocate making English the country's official language, as it is in at least twenty-eight states.<ref name=ILW>{{cite web|author=Feder, Jody| url = http://www.ilw.com/immigrationdaily/news/2007,0515-crs.pdf| title = English as the Official Language of the United States—Legal Background and Analysis of Legislation in the 110th Congress|date=January 25, 2007| publisher=Ilw.com (Congressional Research Service)| access-date =June 19, 2007}}</ref> Both English and [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]] are official languages in Hawaii by state law.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hawaii.gov/lrb/con/conart15.html |title=The Constitution of the State of Hawaii, Article XV, Section 4 |publisher=Hawaii Legislative Reference Bureau |date=November 7, 1978 |access-date=June 19, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070705235552/http://www.hawaii.gov/lrb/con/conart15.html |archive-date=July 5, 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Religion in the United States has a high adherence level compared to other developed countries, as well as a diversity in beliefs. The [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] to the country's [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] prevents the Federal government from making any "law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof". The [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] has interpreted this as preventing the government from having any authority in religion. A majority of Americans report that religion plays a "very important" role in their lives, a proportion unusual among [[developed country|developed countries]], although similar to the other nations of the Americas.<ref>{{cite web | title =U.S. Stands Alone in its Embrace of Religion | work=Pew Global Attitudes Project | url = http://pewglobal.org/reports/display.php?ReportID=167 | access-date =January 1, 2007 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070208155508/http://pewglobal.org/reports/display.php?ReportID=167| archive-date= February 8, 2007 | url-status= live}}</ref> Many faiths have flourished in the United States, including both later imports spanning the country's multicultural immigrant heritage, as well as those founded within the country; these have led the United States to become the most religiously diverse country in the world.<ref>{{cite book |title= A New Religious America: the World's Most Religiously Diverse Nation|last=Eck |first=Diana |year= 2002|publisher=HarperOne|isbn= 978-0-06-062159-9 |page=432 |url=https://archive.org/details/newreligiousamer00eckd|url-access= registration}}</ref>

Several of the original [[Thirteen Colonies]] were established by settlers who wished to practice their own religion without discrimination: the Massachusetts Bay Colony was established by English [[Puritan]]s, Pennsylvania by Irish and English [[Quakers]], Maryland by English and [[Irish Catholic]]s, and Virginia by English [[Anglicans]]. Although some individual states retained established religious confessions well into the 19th century, the United States was the first nation to have no official state-endorsed religion.<ref>Feldman, Noah (2005). ''Divided by God''. Farrar, Straus and Giroux, pg. 10 ("For the first time in recorded history, they designed a government with no established religion at all.")</ref> Modeling the provisions concerning religion within the [[Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom]], the framers of the Constitution rejected any religious test for office, and the First Amendment specifically denied the federal government any power to enact any law respecting either an establishment of religion or prohibiting its free exercise, thus protecting any religious organization, institution, or denomination from government interference. The decision was mainly influenced by European Rationalist and Protestant ideals, but was also a consequence of the pragmatic concerns of minority religious groups and small states that did not want to be under the power or influence of a national religion that did not represent them.<ref>Marsden, George M. 1990. ''Religion and American Culture.'' Orlando: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, pp.45–46.</ref>

==Culture==
{{Main|Culture of the United States}}
[[File:Motherhood and apple pie.jpg|thumb|right|[[Apple pie]] and [[baseball]] are icons of American culture.]]
The [[culture of the United States|American culture]] is primarily a [[Western culture]], but is influenced by [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]], [[African American|West African]], [[Asian American|East Asian]], [[Polynesian American|Polynesian]], and [[Latin America]]n cultures.

The United States of America has its own unique social and cultural characteristics, such as [[American English|dialect]], [[Music of the United States|music]], [[Visual art of the United States|arts]], [[Society of the United States|social habits]], [[Cuisine of the United States|cuisine]] and [[Folklore of the United States|folklore]].<ref name="Society in Focus" />

Its chief early [[Europe]]an influences came from [[English American|English]], [[Scottish American|Scottish]], [[Welsh American|Welsh]], and [[Irish American|Irish]] settlers of [[Colonial history of the United States|colonial America]] during [[Thirteen Colonies|British rule]]. [[Culture of the United Kingdom|British culture]], due to colonial ties with Britain that spread the English language, [[English law|legal system]] and other cultural inheritances, had a formative influence.<ref>{{cite book|author=Carlos E.

American culture includes both [[Conservatism|conservative]] and [[Liberalism|liberal]] elements, scientific and religious competitiveness, political structures, risk taking and free expression, materialist and moral elements. Despite certain consistent ideological principles (e.g. [[individualism]], [[egalitarianism]], faith in freedom and [[democracy]]), the American culture has a variety of expressions due to its geographical scale and demographic diversity.

==Diaspora==

Americans have migrated to many places around the world, including [[Americans in Argentina|Argentina]], [[American Australians|Australia]], [[Americans in Brazil|Brazil]], [[American Canadians|Canada]], [[Americans and Canadians in Chile|Chile]], [[Americans in China|China]], [[Americans in Costa Rica|Costa Rica]], [[Americans in France|France]], [[Americans in Germany|Germany]], [[Americans in Hong Kong|Hong Kong]], [[Americans in India|India]], [[Americans in Japan|Japan]], [[American immigration to Mexico|Mexico]], [[American New Zealanders|New Zealand]], [[Americans in Pakistan|Pakistan]], the [[American settlement in the Philippines|Philippines]], the [[Americans in the United Arab Emirates|United Arab Emirates]], and the [[Americans in the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]]. {{as of|2016}}, there were approximately 9&nbsp;million U.S. citizens living outside of the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://travel.state.gov/content/dam/travel/CA_By_the_Numbers.pdf|title=CA by the Numbers|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160616233331/https://travel.state.gov/content/dam/travel/CA_By_the_Numbers.pdf|archive-date=2016-06-16}}</ref>
