==History==

===Early history===
Sister Marie Eugénie Milleret de Brou (later canonised as Saint [[Marie-Eugénie de Jésus]]; 1817–1898) established the Congregation of the Religious of the Assumption in [[Paris]] on 30 April 1839 as a means to make a Christian transformation of society through education.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vatican.va/news_services/liturgy/saints/ns_lit_doc_20070603_eugenie-jesus_en.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-05-24 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150612191736/https://www.vatican.va/news_services/liturgy/saints/ns_lit_doc_20070603_eugenie-jesus_en.html |archivedate=2015-06-12 }}</ref> The order arrived in [[History of the Philippines (1521-1898)|Spanish colonial Philippines]] in 1892, and at the request of Queen [[Maria Christina of Austria|María Cristina]], consort of King [[Alfonso XII of Spain]], they established the Superior Normal School for Women Teachers in Intramuros in 1892 which pioneered women education in the Philippines. Among its first alumnae were Rosa Sevilla de Alvero, Foundress of the ''Instituto de Mujeres''; [[Librada Avelino]] and [[Carmen de Luna]], who founded [[Centro Escolar University]]. At the outbreak of the [[Philippine Revolution of 1896]], the order ceased operation of the school and returned to Europe.<ref name="philstar.com"/>

===Herran-Dakota campus===
At the request of [[Pope Pius X]], a group of [[English language|anglophone]] Assumption Sisters returned to [[Manila]] in 1904; the [[Insular Government|Philippine Islands]]<!-- DO NOT change to 'Philippines' and 'is', since the usage of the term 'Philippine Islands' and its subsequent reference as a plural ('were') are historically correct for the Spanish and American colonial periods before 1946.--> were by then already under [[American Colonial Period (Philippines)|American control]]. With the group of Sisters were Mother Helen Margaret as Superior, and Mother Rosa María Pachoud, Mother Esperanza Maria A. CuUnjieng, Madame Angela Ansaldo, Sr. Lory Mapa, Sr. Luisa Locsin and Sr. Bianca Rosa Perez Rubio who subsequently spent most of her religious life in the Religious of the Assumption in [[Asia]]. Originally an elementary and secondary school, the College was added in 1940. Its successors are Assumption College San Lorenzo and [[Assumption Antipolo]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}}

Formerly found in the genteel enclave of Ermita, the school very much resembled the renowned girls’ schools of [[France]] and the rest of [[Europe]], becoming a favourite amongst Manila's pre-War élite. It was considered a school for the ''alta de sociedad'' and there was no other value more emphasised than the French term ''[[noblesse oblige]]'': “To whom much is given, much will be required.” The school was once at the corner of Calle Herran and Calle Dakota (now known as [[Pedro Gil]] and Adriatico, respectively), beside the old Padre Faura campus of the all-boys' [[Ateneo de Manila University|Ateneo de Manila]], where the brothers of Assumptionistas often studied. It was from this time when the so-called “Ateneo-Assumption” families sprung up, with entire clans exclusively attending either school. It offered subjects such as [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[French language|French]], Language and Reading in [[English language|English]], Arithmetic, and Religion, as well as Manners and Penmanship.<ref name="wordpress.com"/>

During the [[Second World War]], the whole school and the rest of the city were destroyed by heavy aerial bombardment in the 1945 [[Liberation of Manila]]. As with many schools, Assumption College resumed classes in [[quonset hut]]s and in a battered auditorium in the ruins of the Herran campus. Mother Superior Rosa María and Madame Esperanza Maria A. CuUnjieng brought the school back to its feet and relaunched it in 1947 when the Reconstruction began, reopening in 1948. The Herran campus officially closed its doors in 1973, and today [[Robinsons Place Manila]] currently stands where it stood with the Padre Faura campus of Ateneo also stood.<ref name="wordpress.com"/>

====Architecture and culture====
A vast and stately school with manicured gardens, the Assumption Convent had high-ceilinged and arcaded school buildings in the [[neo-Gothic]] style, with lush plants and numerous trees. Possessing a very French, feminine aura, the convent school sported arched windows and corridors, partly hidden floral medallions, (specifically the [[fleur-de-lys]] common to the other French girls' school, [[Saint Paul University Manila]]), and even a lagoon with boats.<ref name="wordpress.com"/>

The Herran Assumption also featured one of the best school chapels in [[Manila]]. [[Neo-Gothic]] in design, the chapel featured arched, stained-glass windows and a comparatively small [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] main altar. Students of the Herran campus still observed older practises of the [[Catholic Church]], with students made to genuflect upon entering any place where the [[Blessed Sacrament]] was kept. In those days, students also signed for fifteen-minute shifts for the [[adoration of the Blessed Sacrament]]; they were thusly excused from any class. In the afternoons, the students with lacy white ''[[mantilla]]s'' on their heads, filled the chapel for common adoration, ending the day with singing the ''[[Tantum Ergo]]''.<ref name="wordpress.com"/>

There were also the very distinct things done within the walls of the school that through the decades would have the virtual label of "Assumption". There were the Assumption tarts (triangular tarts topped with [[guava]] jelly), and the Assumption [[Siomai#Philippine siomai|siomai]], beloved by students because of how it tasted like those made by [[Ma Mon Luk]], a famous noodle shop. There was also Assumption cottage pie, ground meat topped with mashed potatoes served at the [[refectory]]. Students wore the distinct Assumption uniform of a [[tartan]] skirt (the fabric of which was first imported from [[France]]<ref name="wordpress.com1"/>), sailor-collared shirts and a pin with a gold-coloured school seal. The lace-filled immaculately white uniforms called "gala dress" were reserved for more formal occasions such as Mass and Graduation Rites. Visiting guests had to contend themselves of speaking with the students in a [[parlour]].<ref name="wordpress.com"/>

Girls played a ball game they called ''bataille'' and were taught to [[curtsey]] before nuns, specifically the Mother Superior whom they were taught to address as "''Notre Mère''" ("our mother").<ref name="wordpress.com1"/> A lasting hallmark of an "Old Girl" is the school's conspicuous [[penmanship]] known as "Assumption Script". Letters are distinctly long with sharp elongated points, it is a precise [[cursive]], with flourished [[majuscule]]s and jagged tails. It was a source of pride, according to Gonzalez,<ref>Gonzalez, Gizela Maria. [https://www.amazon.com/The-Manila-Knew-newsprint-version/dp/9712718603 The Manila We Knew]. Manila: Anvil Publishing, 2006.</ref> and a way of immediately identifying an Herran Assumptionista.<ref name="wordpress.com"/>

===Herran closure and San Lorenzo-Antipolo transfers===
The school then expanded to its San Lorenzo, [[Makati]] campus, welcoming 180 students into its preparatory and elementary levels in June 1958. The following year, Assumption College San Lorenzo opened its doors to college-bound young women, and the College moved there in 1959.

After some time, the Herran campus was sold as the area was becoming a commercial and tourist centre not conducive to learning. In 1972–73, four San Lorenzo campus teachers were transferred to pave the way for merging elementary schools and secondary schools of Herran and San Lorenzo. In 1973–74, the Herran and San Lorenzo schools fused: the High School and the College were based in San Lorenzo while the Preschool and Grade School briefly occupied Herran, temporarily moving to San Lorenzo in June 1974.

The Grade School finally resettled in [[Assumption Antipolo]] along Sumulong Highway on 11 September 1974, with the Preschool staying in San Lorenzo. However, the distance between Antipolo and Manila became a problem, driving alumnae and parents petition the College to re-open the elementary level in San Lorenzo. Grade 1 was re-opened in 1981 and starting school year 1988–89, grade levels were added until the San Lorenzo Grade School's first batch of seventh Grade students graduated in March 1993.

===Response to the Church===
In line with the spirit of [[Vatican II]], and in response to the call of the Church in the Second [[Plenary Council]] of the Philippines and the needs of the country, the Assumption in the Philippines has moved towards the rural areas and the underprivileged sector, without abandoning the education of the upper/middle classes.

==Institution==

===Basic Education Division===
*Pre-school and Kinder: The Preschool program of the Assumption gives a premium to character formation and instills in students a love for learning and a beginning sense of social responsibility.
*Gradeschool (Grade 1 to Grade 6): In the Grade School program, a well-rounded curriculum is delivered using brain-based instructional strategies. Students acquire knowledge and skills in real-life contexts, particularly through Project-Based Learning, Singapore Math, Science, and Social Studies inquiry activities, and design tasks. They learn about mindfulness, reflection, and prayer to build the foundations of a strong relationship with God. They are also given regular opportunities to interact with different sectors of society through Concrete Acts for Social Transformation (C.A.S.T).
*Junior High School (Grade 7 to Grade 10): The Junior High School program forms students of character who excel academically, exhibit a growing sense of social responsibility, and enjoy a personal relationship with God. As in Grade School, learning continues to occur in real-life contexts with Project-Based Learning, inquiry activities and investigations, and design tasks. Enrichment programs in Math, Science, Writing, and Filipinos are offered, and students are given opportunities for collaboration and leadership.
*Senior High School (Grade 11 to Grade 12): The Senior High School program is anchored on the goal of “Christianization of the intelligence” so as to form women servant-leaders who love their times and work for the transformation of society. The curriculum aims to instill a love for learning and passion for undertaking research by providing real-life, relevant, interdisciplinary, and student-centered opportunities to develop Prime Life Abilities. Students engage in a variety of authentic projects and activities such as the Research Congress, Science Innovation, Business Implementation, and Arts Curation and Production, Work Immersion, Inter-Faith Youth Camp and Model ASEAN Summit in order to prepare them for college/university and the workplace.  
Assumption College Senior High School offers four strands: Accounting, Business & Management (ABM), Arts & Design (A&D), Humanities and Social Sciences (HUMSS) and Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM).
