The '''Women's Tennis Association''' ('''WTA''') is the principal organizing body of [[Women's tennis|women's professional tennis]]. It governs the [[WTA Tour]] which is the worldwide professional tennis tour for women and was founded to create a better future for women's tennis. The WTA's corporate headquarters is in [[St. Petersburg, Florida]], with its European headquarters in London and its Asia-Pacific headquarters in Beijing.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wtatennis.com/press-center|title=WTA Press Center}}</ref>

The Women's Tennis Association was founded in June 1973 by [[Billie Jean King]], and traces its origins to the inaugural [[1970 Houston Women's Invitation|Virginia Slims]] tournament, arranged by [[Gladys Heldman]], sponsored by [[Joe Cullman]], CEO of Philip Morris, and held on 23 September 1970 at the Houston Racquet Club in [[Houston]], Texas. [[Rosie Casals]] won this first event.

When the Women's Tennis Association was founded, Billie Jean King was one of nine players that comprised the WTA, also referred to as the Original 9, that included [[Julie Heldman]], [[Valerie Ziegenfuss]], [[Judy Dalton]], [[Kristy Pigeon]], [[Peaches Bartkowicz]], [[Kerry Melville Reid]], [[Nancy Richey]], and [[Rosie Casals]].<ref name="WTATourHistory" />  Today, the WTA has more than 2,500 players from nearly 100 countries competing for $146&nbsp;million in prize money.

==Early history==
The [[Open Era]], in which professional players were allowed to compete alongside amateurs, began in 1968. Billie Jean King was a high ranking tennis player in the late 1960s who won several titles and was interviewed in the media.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Smith |first1=Lissa |title=Nike is a Goddess: The History of Women in Sports |url=https://archive.org/details/nikeisgoddess00liss |url-access=registration |date=1998 |location=New York, NY |pages=[https://archive.org/details/nikeisgoddess00liss/page/65 65] |edition=1}}</ref> The first Open Tournament was the [[British Hard Court Championships]] in [[Bournemouth]]. At the first Open Wimbledon, the prize fund difference was 2.5:1 in favor of men. King won £750 for taking the title, while [[Rod Laver]] won £2,000. The total purses of both competitions were £14,800 for men and £5,680 for women. Confusion also reigned as no one knew how many Open Tournaments there were supposed to be. The tournaments that did not want to provide prize money eventually faded out of the calendar, including the US Eastern Grass Court circuit with stops at [[Merion Cricket Club]] and Essex county club.

There were two professional tennis circuits in existence at the start of the Open Era: [[World Championship Tennis]] (WCT), which was for men only, and the [[National Tennis League]] (NTL). [[Ann Haydon-Jones|Ann Jones]], [[Rosie Casals]], [[Françoise Dürr]], and Billie Jean King joined NTL. King was paid $40,000 a year, Jones was paid $25,000, and Casals and Durr were paid $20,000 each. The group played established tournaments, such as the US Open and Wimbledon. But the group also organised their own tournaments, playing in the South of France for two months. The [[International Tennis Federation]] (ITF) then imposed several sanctions on the group: the women were not allowed to play in the [[Wightman Cup]] in 1968 and 1969 and the [[USTA|USLTA]] refused to include Casals and King in their rankings for those years.

By the 1970s the pay differential had increased. King said "Promoters were making more money than women. Male tennis players were making more money. Everybody was making more money except the women<ref>{{cite web |last1=women |title=an adult female human being: She's a really nice woman. A woman and two men were arrested the day after the explosion. Women first got the vote in Britain in 1918. She is Ireland's first woman (= female) president |url=https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/woman |website=Cambridge Dictionary |accessdate=1 June 2020}}</ref>". In 1969, ratios of 5:1 in terms of pay between men and women were common at smaller tournaments. By 1970 these figures had increased to up to 12:1.

In 1970 [[Margaret Court]] won the Grand Slam and received only a $15,000 bonus, whereas the men could achieve up to $1&nbsp;million. The low point in women's pay inequality came before the US Open in 1970. The [[Pacific Southwest Championships]] directed by [[Jack Kramer]], had announced a 12:1 ratio in the prize money difference between what males and females would win. The tournament would not take place until after the US Open. Several female players contacted [[Gladys Heldman]], publisher of ''[[World Tennis Magazine]]'', and stated that they wanted to boycott the event. While she advised against it, she then created the [[1970 Houston Women's Invitation]] for nine women players.<ref>{{cite book|last1=King|first1=Billie Jean|last2=Starr|first2=Cynthia|title=We Have Come a Long Way : The Story of Women's Tennis|date=1988|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|isbn=9780070346253|pages=[https://archive.org/details/wehavecomelongwa00king/page/123 123–127]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/wehavecomelongwa00king/page/123}}</ref>

The original nine women from the Houston event, along with Heldman, then created their own tour, the [[Virginia Slims Circuit]], which would later absorb the ILTF's Women's Grand Prix circuit, and eventually become the WTA Tour. The circuit was composed of 19 tournaments, all based in the United States (one in [[Puerto Rico]]),<ref name=WTATourHistory>{{cite web|url=http://www.sonyericssonwtatour.com/3/global/includes/TrackIt.asp?file=http://www.sonyericssonwtatour.com/3/global/pdfs/events/2008/tournamentfinals.pdf|title=WTA Tour history|publisher=Women's Tennis Association (WTA)|accessdate=12 September 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080529060754/http://www.sonyericssonwtatour.com/3/global/includes/TrackIt.asp?file=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sonyericssonwtatour.com%2F3%2Fglobal%2Fpdfs%2Fevents%2F2008%2Ftournamentfinals.pdf|archivedate=29 May 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref> and prize money totalled $309,100.<ref name=WTAHistory>{{cite web|url=http://www.wtatennis.com/scontent/article/2951989/title/about-the-wta|title=About the WTA|publisher=Women's Tennis Association (WTA)|accessdate=20 April 2017|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140926003513/http://www.wtatennis.com/scontent/article/2951989/title/about-the-wta|archivedate=26 September 2014}}</ref>

Formation of the Virginia Slims Circuit resulted in part from changes that tennis was undergoing at the time and from the way prize monies were distributed. During the first two years of the Open Era many male players began playing professionally, and the tournaments in which they competed, often men's and women's combined events, attracted increased investment. The [[International Tennis Federation|International Lawn Tennis Federation]] (ILTF) began dropping several women's competitions from the tournaments it presided over.  For example, in 1970, the ILTF sanctioned 15 men-only tournaments, all of which had previously been combined events.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f957-IG2HckC|title=Billie Jean King: Tennis Trailblazer|isbn=0-8225-4959-X|chapter=Fighting for Equality|page=57|author=Joanne Lannin|publisher=Lerner Publications|accessdate=12 September 2008|date=January 1999}}</ref>

{{main|WTA Tour}}
The WTA was founded at a meeting organised by Billie Jean King, a week before the [[1973 Wimbledon Championships]]. This meeting was held at Gloucester Hotel in London. In 1975, the WTA increased its financial stature by signing a television broadcast contract with [[CBS]], the first in the WTA's history. Further financial developments ensued.  In 1976, [[Colgate-Palmolive|Colgate]] assumed sponsorship of the circuit from April to November.  In 1979, [[Avon Products|Avon]] replaced Virginia Slims as the sponsor of the winter circuit, and in its first year offered the largest prize fund for a single tournament, $100,000 for the [[WTA Tour Championships|Avon Championships]], in the WTA tennis history.<ref name=WTAHistory/> The ''Colgate Series'', renamed the ''[[Toyota]] Series'' in 1981, included tournaments in all parts of the world, whereas the Avon sponsored events took place solely in the US. The two circuits merged beginning with the [[1983 WTA Tour|1983 season]], when Virginia Slims returned to take full sponsorship rights of the WTA Tour. Every tournament under the administration of the WTA now became part of the ''Virginia Slims World Championships Series''.<ref name=WTATourHistory/><ref name=WTAHistory/>

In all, Virginia Slims (Philip Morris) sponsored women's tennis from 1970 to 1978 and again from 1983 to 1994.  The sponsored has received such criticism as the following from the Stanford [University] Research Into the Impact of Tobacco Advertising: "Virginia Slims cleverly sponsored the WTA Tour Championships at the time to increase connections between cigarettes and healthy female athletes."<ref>Stanford [University] Research Into the Impact of Tobacco Advertising (SRITA), [http://tobacco.stanford.edu/tobacco_main/images_body.php?token1=fm_img7318.php untitled document, Nov. 1994 Madison Square Garden Championship with detailed drawing of player Martina Navratilova.]</ref>

In 1977, women's tennis was the first professional sport opened to transgender women. The New York Supreme Court ruled in favour of [[Renée Richards]], a player who underwent male-to-female [[sex reassignment surgery]]. Eligibility of transgender players is officially regulated under the current WTA official rulebook.<ref>[http://www.wtatennis.com/sites/default/files/wta_gender_participation_policy.pdf WTA official rulebook]</ref>

In April 1977, the ''Washington Post'' published an article entitled "Social Variety Is Slim On Women's Tennis Tour" which looked at some of the downside and difficulties faced by touring tennis pros, not unlike the problems of traveling musicians performing a whole series of tour dates and gigs. The article included the phrase "comradeship that falls short of camaraderie", because fellow members were also competitors who usually felt they needed to maintain a certain amount of distance. One player was quoted as saying, "But if you are not playing well, it is very hard."<ref>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/sports/1977/04/17/social-variety-is-slim-on-womens-tennis-tour/18926de8-a4bf-4e63-b146-d2ef296d0fb7/?noredirect=on Social Variety Is Slim On Women's Tennis Tour], ''Washington Post'', Barry Lorge, April 17, 1977.</ref>

In 1984, The Australian Open joined the US Open in offering women equal prize money, but temporarily did not between 1996 and 2000. After a 30-year campaign, 2007 marked the historic achievement of equal prize money at Roland Garros and Wimbledon. This meant all four major tournaments offered parity.

In 1995, the WTA Players Association merged with the Women's Tennis Council to form the WTA Tour.<ref name="WTATourHistory" />

===Growth milestones===
The WTA circuit continued to expand during these years. In 1971, King became the first female athlete to surpass $100,000 in earnings for a single year.<ref name=WTATourHistory/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.womenssportsfoundation.org/Content/Articles/About%20WSF/B/Billie%20Jean%20King%20Founder%20Leader%20Legend.aspx|title=Billie Jean King: Founder, Leader, Legend|publisher=Women's Sports Foundation|accessdate=12 September 2008}}</ref> [[Chris Evert]] became the first female athlete to win over $1,000,000 in career earnings in 1976. By 1980, over 250 women were playing professionally, and the circuit consisted of 47 global events, offering a total of $7.2&nbsp;million in prize money. These increased financial opportunities allowed for groundbreaking developments not only in tennis, but across women's sports.

In 1982, [[Martina Navratilova]] became the first to win over $1,000,000 in a single year. Navratilova's single year earnings exceeded $2&nbsp;million in 1984.  In 1997, [[Martina Hingis]] became the first to earn over $3&nbsp;million during a single year.  In 2003, [[Kim Clijsters]] surpassed $4&nbsp;million in earnings for a single year. In 2006, [[Venus Williams]] and the WTA pushed for equal prize money at both the French Open and [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]].  Both of these [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] events relented in 2007 and awarded equal money for the first time.  This enabled [[Justine Henin]], who won the French Open in 2007, to earn over $5&nbsp;million that year, becoming the first woman in sports to do this.<ref name=Prize>{{cite web|url=http://www.sonyericssonwtatour.com/3/newsroom/stories/?ContentID=1971|title=Davenport Tops All-Time Prize Money List|publisher=Women's Tennis Association (WTA)|date=14 January 2007|accessdate=12 September 2008}}</ref> In 2009, [[Serena Williams]] went over the six million mark by earning over $6.5&nbsp;million in a single year. Then in 2012 both Serena Williams and [[Victoria Azarenka]] became first players to exceed $7&nbsp;million in prize money in a single season. In 2013 [[Serena Williams]] went over the twelve million dollar mark winning $12,385,572 in a single year.

===Management===
American sports entrepreneur Jerry Diamond (1928–1996) served as executive director of the women's association from 1974 to 1985. He was instrumental in negotiating business deals with Avon, Colgate-Palmolive, and Toyota, and worked out the deal that made Virginia Slims the titular sponsor of the WTA tour.<ref>{{cite news|author1=Robin Finn|title=Jerry Diamond, 68, Women's Tennis Leader|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/12/18/sports/jerry-diamond-68-women-s-tennis-leader.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=18 December 1996}}</ref>

==Ranking method==
The WTA rankings are based on a rolling 52-week, cumulative system. A player's ranking is determined by her results at a maximum of 16 tournaments for singles and 11 for doubles and points are awarded based on how far a player advances in a tournament. The basis for calculating a player's ranking are those tournaments that yield the highest ranking points during the rolling 52-week period with the condition that they must include points from the Grand Slams, Premier Mandatory tournaments, and the WTA Finals. In addition, for Top 20 players, their best two results at Premier 5 tournaments will also count.<ref>{{cite web|title=WTA – All About Rankings|url=http://www.wtatennis.com/all-about-rankings#|publisher=WTA}}</ref> All WTA players also have a [[Universal Tennis Rating]], based on head-to-head results.
<!-- The WTA also distributes ranking points, for singles players only, who compete at the [[Tennis at the Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.itftennis.com/news/79975.aspx|accessdate=1 February 2015|title=ITF and ATP announce Olympic agreement|publisher=itftennis.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://nanjing.itftennis.com/olympics/players/ranking-points.aspx|accessdate=16 September 2014|title=Ranking Points|publisher=itftennis.com}}</ref> Points earned at the Summer Olympics will only apply to a player's overall ranking during that calendar year. -->
