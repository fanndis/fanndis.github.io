The '''15th presidential and vice-presidential election of the Republic of China''' ({{zh|t=中華民國第十五屆總統副總統選舉}}) was held in [[Taiwan]] on 11 January 2020 along with the [[2020 Taiwanese legislative election|10th Legislative Yuan election]]. Incumbent president [[Tsai Ing-wen]] and former [[Premier of the Republic of China|premier]] [[William Lai]] of the [[Democratic Progressive Party]] (DPP) won the election, defeating [[Kaohsiung]] mayor [[Han Kuo-yu]] of the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT) and his running mate [[Chang San-cheng]], as well as third-party candidate [[James Soong]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-taiwan-election-opposition-idUSKBN1ZA0HJ|title=Taiwan opposition candidate admits defeat in presidential election|date=2020-01-11|work=Reuters|access-date=2020-01-11|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200122200159/https://www.reuters.com/article/us-taiwan-election-opposition-idUSKBN1ZA0HJ|archive-date=22 January 2020|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/11/taiwan-re-elects-tsai-ing-wen-as-president-in-clear-message-to-china|title=Taiwan re-elects Tsai Ing-Wen as president in clear message to China|last=Kuo|first=Lily|date=2020-01-11|work=The Guardian|access-date=2020-01-11|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200111150411/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/11/taiwan-re-elects-tsai-ing-wen-as-president-in-clear-message-to-china|archive-date=11 January 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>

Following major losses during the [[2018 Taiwanese local elections]], Tsai Ing-wen resigned from her party's chairmanship and was challenged in the primary contest by former Premier William Lai, himself a former Tsai appointee. The Kuomintang also ran a competitive primary, which saw Han Kuo-yu, initially reluctant to run, defeat former presidential candidate and [[New Taipei]] mayor [[Eric Chu]], and Foxconn chief executive [[Terry Gou]]. 

Both domestic issues and [[Cross-Strait relations]] featured in the campaign, with Han attacking Tsai for her perceived failures in labour reform, economic management, and dealing with corruption of her aides. However, Tsai's strong response to Beijing's increasing pressures on Taiwan to accede to a unification agreement, amid the backdrop of the intensely followed [[2019–20 Hong Kong protests|Hong Kong anti-extradition protests]], proved crucial in her recapturing broad support.

The election had a [[voter turnout|turnout]] of 74.9%, the highest among nationwide elections since 2008. Tsai won a record 8.17 million votes, representing 57.1% of the popular vote, the highest vote share won by a DPP candidate in presidential elections.<ref>{{cite news |last1=黃欣柏、吳書緯 |title=連任成功！蔡英文817萬票史上最高 樹立「小英障礙」 |url=https://election.ltn.com.tw/2020/news/overview/breakingnews/3037620 |accessdate=12 January 2020 |agency=Liberty Times |date=11 January 2020}}</ref> The DPP received a higher share of the vote in major metropolitan areas, reversing the KMT's fortunes in Kaohsiung and environs, while the Kuomintang retained strength in limited eastern regions and off-island constituencies. Tsai and Lai were inaugurated on 20 May 2020.

==Eligibility==
Presidential candidates and Vice Presidential [[running mate]]s are elected on the same ticket, using [[first-past-the-post voting]]. This was the seventh [[direct election]] of the president and vice president, the posts having previously been [[indirectly elected]] by the [[National Assembly (Republic of China)|National Assembly]] until 1996.

Under applicable legislation, any party which received more than five per cent of the total vote share in the latest election in any level were eligible to contest the election.  The [[Democratic Progressive Party]] (DPP), [[Kuomintang]] (KMT), [[New Power Party]] (NPP) and [[People First Party (Taiwan)|People First Party]] (PFP) were eligible, though in the end only three major-party candidates were certified: incumbent President [[Tsai Ing-wen]] of the Democratic Progressive Party, Kaohsiung mayor [[Han Kuo-yu]] of Kuomintang, and perennial veteran candidate [[James Soong]] of the People First Party. Vice President [[Chen Chien-jen]], Tsai's running mate in 2016, was eligible for re-election but chose not to contest.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://law.moj.gov.tw/ENG/LawClass/LawAll.aspx?pcode=D0020053|title=Presidential and Vice Presidential Election and Recall Act|access-date=15 January 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190113232230/https://law.moj.gov.tw/ENG/LawClass/LawAll.aspx?pcode=D0020053|archive-date=13 January 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Background==
Tsai Ing-wen suffered a stinging defeat during the [[2018 Taiwanese local elections]] due to widespread discontentment over numerous domestic policy issues, including public pension reform, same-sex marriage, pollution, and labour reform. In the lead up to the election, her staffers were found to have been implicated in a tobacco smuggling ring, which also allegedly involved the top management of flag carrier [[China Airlines]] and [[National Security Bureau (Taiwan)|National Security Bureau]]. Dogged by scandal and having lost on major referenda questions, Tsai's clout continued to deteriorate both in her own party and more broadly.<ref>{{cite news |title=随行出访国安人员走私香烟 蔡英文震怒三官员受惩处 |url=http://www.zaobao.com/special/report/politic/taiwan/story20190723-974703 |accessdate=2019-07-26 |publisher=联合早报 |date=2019-07-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190915085410/https://www.zaobao.com.sg/special/report/politic/taiwan/story20190723-974703 |archive-date=2019-09-15 |url-status=live }}</ref> 

The major inflection of the campaign came amid the [[2019–20 Hong Kong protests|Hong Kong anti-extradition bill protests]], an event that was triggered with the [[murder of Poon Hiu-wing]] in Taiwan. As the protests became heated over the later half of 2019, Tsai began to portray the situation in Hong Kong as a direct result of an encroachment of the territory's autonomy from Beijing. In January 2019, [[Xi Jinping]], [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China]], had announced an open letter to Taiwan proposing a [[one country, two systems]] formula for eventual unification. Additionally, over the course of 2019, several small nations that previously had diplomatic ties to Taiwan, including Panama, Kiribati, and Solomon Islands, broke off relations in favour of the PRC. Tsai issued pronouncements that Taiwan will "never accept one country, two systems" and that "today's Hong Kong could be tomorrow's Taiwan". Tsai's strong positioning ultimately led her to victory in what was a bruising primary challenge by Premier [[William Lai]].<ref name=fans>{{cite web |title=反送中蔓延 助攻蔡大選 |url=https://udn.com/news/story/11321/3985198 |website=聯合新聞網 |accessdate=2019-08-13 |date=13 August 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190901142825/https://udn.com/news/story/11321/3985198 |archive-date=1 September 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> 

Tsai reconciled with diverse elements in her party in signing up Lai to be her running mate. Kuomintang, after fits and starts over procedural disputes, flirted with a high-profile nomination of [[Foxconn]] chief [[Terry Gou]]. The party ultimately nominated firebrand [[Han Kuo-yu]], who had in 2018 successfully run an insurgent mayoral campaign in the DPP stronghold of [[Kaohsiung]]. However, his combative, eccentric antics and participation in the presidential election soon after his taking on the post in Kaohsiung earned him scorn from detractors.<ref>{{cite news |title=罵完警政署又被韓粉攻 黃光芹氣炸：我跟韓國瑜勢不兩立 |url=https://news.ltn.com.tw/news/politics/breakingnews/2798989 |accessdate=2020-01-09 |work=自由時報 |date=2019-05-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190523135035/https://news.ltn.com.tw/news/politics/breakingnews/2798989 |archive-date=23 May 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |author1=黃婉婷 |title=鳳凰與雞的「雞」是誰？韓國瑜曝海關陳情：最近很多來台賣淫、非法打工的人 |url=https://www.storm.mg/article/1671777 |accessdate=2020-01-09 |work=風傳媒 |date=2019-09-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191230034118/https://www.storm.mg/article/1671777 |archive-date=30 December 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> Additionally, Tsai made hay with Han's perceived friendliness with Beijing, citing his early 2019 visit to mainland China where he met with multiple high-level Communist Party officials, and his continued recognition of the [[1992 Consensus]], which Tsai had disavowed.<ref name=fans/> Han eventually spoke out against one country, two systems, remarking that it will never happen if he was president unless it was "over my dead body."

The election also saw widespread accusations from both sides that internet trolls were working to sway public opinion, including allegations from Australia-based Chinese defector [[William Wang (defector)|William Wang]] that Beijing had used internet operatives to disrupt the election in favor of the KMT.  Various pro-Han Kuo-yu groups on Facebook were also shut down for violating terms and policies.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3823123|title=Chinese spy confirms China's involvement in Taiwan 2020 election|date=23 November 2019|accessdate=25 November 2019|website=[[Taiwan News]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191127172925/https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3823123|archive-date=27 November 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

Incumbent President Tsai Ing-wen's re-election chances were dealt a blow after the Democratic Progressive Party's devastating defeat in the [[2018 Taiwanese local elections|2018 local elections]], where the DPP lost seven of the 13 cities and counties it previously held. The DPP’s share of the vote also fell from 56 to 39 per cent since the 2016 presidential election.<ref>{{cite news|title=Taiwan's ruling party faces serious challenges in 2020|url=http://www.atimes.com/taiwans-ruling-party-faces-serious-challenges-in-2020/|date=2018-12-11|work=Asia Times|access-date=15 January 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190115023811/http://www.atimes.com/taiwans-ruling-party-faces-serious-challenges-in-2020//|archive-date=15 January 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Tsai resigned as the party chairwoman after the defeat.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Lee |first1=Yimou |title=Taiwan president quits as party chair after local election setback |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-taiwan-politics/taiwan-president-quits-as-party-chair-after-local-election-setback-idUSKCN1NT001 |accessdate=12 January 2020 |work=Reuters |date=23 November 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190712002922/https://www.reuters.com/article/us-taiwan-politics/taiwan-president-quits-as-party-chair-after-local-election-setback-idUSKCN1NT001 |archive-date=12 July 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> However, Tsai kept trailing behind in the polls as the surveys found most Taiwanese would not support Tsai in the 2020 election but would support [[Premier of the Republic of China|Premier]] [[William Lai]], who also resigned from the premiership for the electoral defeat in January 2019.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Lee Yimou |title=Taiwan premier, cabinet to quit after local election defeat |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-taiwan-politics/taiwan-premier-cabinet-to-quit-after-local-election-defeat-idUSKCN1P412W |accessdate=12 January 2020 |work=Reuters |date=10 January 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190910095659/https://www.reuters.com/article/us-taiwan-politics/taiwan-premier-cabinet-to-quit-after-local-election-defeat-idUSKCN1P412W |archive-date=10 September 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>

On 19 February 2019, Tsai Ing-wen told CNN in an interview she will run for re-election, despite facing calls from senior members of her own party to not seek re-election. Before her announcement, Tsai had received a bump in the polls after she gave a robust speech saying that her people would never relinquish their democratic freedoms, as a response to the [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China]] [[Xi Jinping]]'s speech in January describing Taiwan's unification with the mainland as "inevitable".<ref name="tsairun">{{cite news|title=Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen says she will run for re-election in 2020|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/taiwan-president-tsai-ing-wen-says-will-run-for-re-election-in-2020|date=19 February 2019|newspaper=The Straits Times|access-date=19 February 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190219211332/https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/taiwan-president-tsai-ing-wen-says-will-run-for-re-election-in-2020|archive-date=19 February 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Debates==
A single television debate was held on 29 December 2019 at 2 PM local time. Most of the themes discussed had already been elaborated upon by the candidates during the policy presentations in the weeks immediately prior to the debate. As usual, [[Cross-Strait relations]] was a focal point of conversation; the candidates also touched upon military spending, nuclear energy, labour relations, and special interests.  Tsai reiterated her commitment to the cross-strait status quo, without "unnecessary provocations" or changes in policy.  Han said he would protect the "sovereignty of the Republic of China".  James Soong said that Taiwan has inherited Chinese culture and tradition but insists that any changes to the island's political status needed to be achieved via "democratic means."<ref name="lens">{{cite news |title=A Recap of Taiwan 2020 Presidential Debate |url=https://international.thenewslens.com/feature/taiwan2020/129435 |work=The News Lens |date=2019-12-30 |access-date=9 January 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191230143728/https://international.thenewslens.com/feature/taiwan2020/129435 |archive-date=30 December 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Han used the debate to paint Tsai variously as being at the mercy of the "New Tide" ultra-progressive wing of her own party, a dictatorial and autocratic figure as president, a leader unable to effectively control her allegedly corrupt subordinates, and a flip-flopper on the issue of cross-strait relations.  Tsai said that Han did not have concrete policies of his own and focused undue attention on attacks against her.  Tsai acknowledged the DPP's poor performance in the local elections of 2018 but reiterated her position that she was the best candidate to protect against perceived encroachment of sovereignty from the PRC; she repeatedly invoked [[One Country, Two Systems]], suggesting that Han would accede to China's position on the issue, and in her closing remarks said "do not let Taiwan be the next Hong Kong". Tsai and Han each accused the other of using internet trolls, so-called "cyber armies", to smear the other.  While Tsai attacked Han for being prejudiced towards marginalized groups, Han tried to brand Tsai as an out-of-touch elitist and himself an everyman who will happily go "have street food" with the common folk as president. James Soong attempted to strike a middle ground, repeating his support for the status quo in cross-strait relations, calling for mutual understanding with the mainland, and denying his own family's connections to mainland business interests.<ref name="lens"/>

The debate was noted for some bizarre exchanges involving Han Kuo-yu, who became especially animated on multiple occasions, raising his voice and using wild hand gestures, most notably yelling the phrase “[[Ten thousand years|Long live the]] [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]]!” three times, in addition to employing props to complement his attacks on Tsai.<ref> https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3943810</ref> In response to questions from ''[[Apple Daily (Taiwan)|Apple Daily]]'' on the relationship between Han and a woman he allegedly had an extramarital affair with, Han called the outlet a "tabloid without the slightest standards," and responded "why don't you also ask how many girlfriends I had in college [...] and when I lost my virginity?" Han used a cross-examination segment to ask the other candidates whether they believed in god, asserted his own Buddhist faith, and said "we will all face judgment one day", without meaningful follow-up. Notably, Han also criticized former KMT president [[Ma Ying-jeou]], saying he was "too soft".<ref name="cna">{{cite news |title=Presidential debate sees attacks on media, personal vitriol |url=https://focustaiwan.tw/politics/201912290011 |work=Focus Taiwan (CNA)|date=2019-12-29}}</ref><ref name="lens"/>
