'''Future studies''', '''futures research''' or '''futurology''', is the systematic, interdisciplinary and holistic study of social and technological advancement, and other environmental trends, often for the purpose of exploring how people will live and work in the future. Predictive techniques, such as forecasting, can be applied, but contemporary futures studies scholars emphasize the importance of systematically exploring alternatives.<ref>{{cite web |author1=James Joseph O'Toole |title=Futurology {{!}} social science |url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/futurology |website=Encyclopedia Britannica |accessdate=11 May 2020 |language=en |date=2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Futurology {{!}} Definition of Futurology by Lexico |url=https://www.lexico.com/en/definition/futurology |website=Lexico Dictionaries {{!}} English |accessdate=11 May 2020 |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Voros|first=Author Joseph|date=2017-02-24|title=The Futures Cone, use and history|url=https://thevoroscope.com/2017/02/24/the-futures-cone-use-and-history/|access-date=2020-07-13|website=The Voroscope|language=en}}</ref> In general, it can be considered as a branch of the [[social science]]s and parallel to the field of [[history]]. Futures studies (colloquially called "'''futures'''" by many of the field's practitioners) seeks to understand what is likely to continue and what could plausibly change. Part of the discipline thus seeks a systematic and pattern-based understanding of past and present, and to explore the possibility of future events and trends.<ref name=Wordnet>{{cite web|title=Futurology|url=http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=futurology&sub=Search+WordNet&o2=&o0=1&o8=1&o1=1&o7=&o5=&o9=&o6=&o3=&o4=&h=|work=Wordnet Search 3.1|publisher=Princeton University|accessdate=16 March 2013}}</ref>

Unlike the physical sciences where a narrower, more specified system is studied, futurology concerns a much bigger and more complex world system. The methodology and knowledge are much less proven as compared to [[natural science]] or even [[social science]] like [[sociology]] and [[economics]]. There is a debate as to whether this discipline is an art or science, and it is sometimes described as [[pseudoscience]];<ref name="Oxford">{{cite dictionary|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803095839389|title=Futurology |work=The Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy|location=futurology|year=2008|quote=Mainly a pseudo-science, given the complexities of social, political, economic, technological, and natural factors.}}</ref><ref name="Williams">{{cite encyclopedia|last=William|first=F.

== Overview ==
Futurology is an [[Interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary field]] that aggregates and analyzes trends, with both lay and professional methods, to compose possible futures. It includes analyzing the sources, patterns, and causes of change and stability in an attempt to develop foresight. Around the world the field is variously referred to as '''futures studies''', '''futures research,''' '''[[strategic foresight]]''', '''futuristics''', '''futures thinking''', '''futuring''', and '''futurology'''. Futures studies and strategic foresight are the academic field's most commonly used terms in the [[English language|English]]-speaking world.<ref name="Sardar, Z. 2010 pp. 177">Sardar, Z. (2010) The Namesake: Futures; futures studies; futurology; futuristic; Foresight -- What’s in a name? Futures, 42 (3), pp. 177–184.</ref>

'''Foresight''' was the original term and was first used in this sense by [[H.G. Wells]] in 1932.<ref name="Wells, H.G. 1932 p. 89-91">Wells, H.G. (1932) 1987. Wanted: Professors of Foresight! ''Futures Research Quarterly'' V3N1 (Spring): p. 89-91.</ref> "Futurology" is a term common in encyclopedias, though it is used almost exclusively by nonpractitioners today, at least in the English-speaking world. "Futurology" is defined as the "study of the future."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nandankanan.tripod.com/scienceterms.htm|title=SCIENCE GLOSSARY|work=tripod.com|access-date=2007-06-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070506011318/http://nandankanan.tripod.com/scienceterms.htm|archive-date=2007-05-06|url-status=dead}}</ref> The term was coined by [[German people|German]] professor [[Ossip K. Flechtheim]] in the mid-1940s, who proposed it as a new branch of knowledge that would include a new science of [[probability]]. This term has fallen from favor in recent decades because modern practitioners stress the importance of alternative, plausible, perferrable and plural futures, rather than one monolithic future, and the limitations of prediction and probability, versus the creation of possible and preferable futures.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Bishop |first1=Peter |last2=Hines |first2=Andy |title=Teaching about the Future |date=2012 |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |location=Houndsmill, UK |isbn=978-0230363496}}</ref>

Three factors usually distinguish futures studies from the research conducted by other disciplines (although all of these disciplines overlap, to differing degrees). First, futures studies often examines trends to compose possible, probable, and preferable futures along with the role "wild cards" can play on future scenarios. Second, futures studies typically attempts to gain a [[Holism|holistic]] or [[systemics|systemic]] view based on insights from a range of different disciplines, generally focusing on the STEEP<ref>{{cite web|title=What is STEEP Analysis?|url=http://pestleanalysis.com/what-is-steep-analysis/|website=PESTLE Analysis|accessdate=6 March 2017|date=2015-02-11}}</ref> categories of Social, Technological, Economic, Environmental and Political. Third, futures studies challenges and unpacks the assumptions behind dominant and contending views of the future. The future thus is not empty but fraught with hidden assumptions. For example, many people expect the collapse of the Earth's ecosystem in the near future, while others believe the current ecosystem will survive indefinitely. A foresight approach would seek to analyze and highlight the assumptions underpinning such views.

As a field, futures studies expands on the research component, by emphasizing the communication of a strategy and the actionable steps needed to implement the plan or plans leading to the preferable future.  It is in this regard, that futures studies evolves from an academic exercise to a more traditional business-like practice, looking to better prepare organizations for the future.

Futures studies does not generally focus on short term predictions such as [[interest rate]]s over the next [[business cycle]], or of managers or investors with short-term time horizons. Most strategic planning, which develops goals and objectives with time horizons of one to three years, is also not considered futures. Plans and strategies with longer time horizons that specifically attempt to anticipate possible future events are definitely part of the field. Learning about medium and long-term developments may at times be observed from their early signs.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hiltunen|first=Elina|title=Weak Signals in Organizational Futures Learning|publisher=Acta Universitatis oeconomicae Helsingiensis|year=2010|isbn=978-952-60-1022-9|location=Helsinki}}</ref> As a rule, futures studies is generally concerned with changes of transformative impact, rather than those of an incremental or narrow scope.

The futures field also excludes those who make future predictions through professed [[supernatural]] means.

To complete a futures study, a domain is selected for examination. The domain is the main idea of the project, or what the outcome of the project seeks to determine.  Domains can have a strategic or exploratory focus and must narrow down the scope of the research.  It examines what will, and more importantly, will not be discussed in the research.
Futures practitioners study trends focusing on STEEP (Social Technological, Economic, Environments and Political) baselines.  Baseline exploration examine current STEEP environments to determine normal trends, called baselines.  Next, practitioners use scenarios to explore different futures outcomes.  Scenarios examine how the future can be different.
1.	Collapse Scenarios seek to answer: What happens if the STEEP baselines fall into ruin and no longer exist? How will that impact STEEP categories?
2.	Transformation Scenarios: explore futures with the baseline of society transiting to a “new” state.  How are the STEEP categories effected if society has a whole new structure?
3.	New Equilibrium: examines an entire change to the structure of the domain. What happens if the baseline changes to a “new” baseline within the same structure of society?

==History==

=== Origins ===
[[File:Hans Holbein, the Younger - Sir Thomas More - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|215x215px|[[Thomas More|Sir Thomas More]], originator of the 'Utopian' ideal.]]
[[Johan Galtung]] and [[Sohail Inayatullah]]<ref>Galtung, Johan and Inayatullah, Sohail (1997). ''Macrohistory and Macrohistorians''. Westport, Ct: Praeger.</ref> argue in ''Macrohistory and Macrohistorians'' that the search for grand patterns of social change goes all the way back to [[Sima Qian|Ssu-Ma Chien]] (145-90BC) and his theory of the cycles of virtue, although the work of [[Ibn Khaldun]] (1332–1406) such as ''The Muqaddimah''<ref>Khaldun, Ibn (1967), ''The Muqaddimah'', Trans. Franz Rosenthal, ed. N.J. Dawood. Princeton: [[Princeton University Press]]</ref> would be an example that is perhaps more intelligible to modern sociology. Early western examples include [[Thomas More|Sir Thomas More]]’s “[[Utopia (book)|Utopia]],” published in 1516, and based upon Plato’s “Republic,” in which a future society has overcome poverty and misery to create a perfect model for living. This work was so powerful that [[utopia]]s, originally meaning "nowhere", have come to represent positive and fulfilling futures in which everyone's needs are met.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=http://www.elon.edu/docs/e-web/predictions/futures%20studies%20timeline.pdf|title=Futures Studies Timeline|last=Anderson|first=Janna|website=www.elon.edu|accessdate=25 February 2018}}</ref>

Some intellectual foundations of futures studies appeared in the mid-19th century. Isadore [[Auguste Comte|Comte]], considered the father of scientific philosophy, was heavily influenced by the work of utopian socialist [[Henri de Saint-Simon|Henri Saint-Simon]], and his discussion of the metapatterns of [[social change]] presages futures studies as a scholarly [[dialogue]].<ref name="Bell 1997">{{cite book| last=Bell| first=Wendell| year=1997| title=Foundations of Futures Studies: Human Science for a New Era| publisher=Transaction Publishers| location=New Brunswick, New Jersey, USA | isbn=978-1-56000-271-0}}</ref>

The first works that attempt to make systematic predictions for the future were written in the 18th century. ''[[Memoirs of the Twentieth Century]]'' written by [[Samuel Madden]] in 1733, takes the form of a series of diplomatic letters written in 1997 and 1998 from British representatives in the foreign cities of [[Constantinople]], [[Rome]], [[Paris]], and [[Moscow]].<ref>"Samuel Madden's ''Memoirs of the Twentieth Century''" Paul Alkon. ''Science Fiction Studies'' Vol. 12, No. 2 (Jul., 1985), pp. 184-201 Published by: SF-TH Inc</ref> However, the technology of the 20th century is identical to that of Madden's own era - the focus is instead on the political and religious state of the world in the future. Madden went on to write ''The Reign of George VI, 1900 to 1925'', where (in the context of the [[History of the British canal system|boom in canal construction at the time]]) he envisioned a large network of waterways that would radically transform patterns of living - "Villages grew into towns and towns became cities".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2000/nov/06/features11.g21|title=And now for the forecast|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=2000-11-06|last1=Margolis|first1=Jonathan}}</ref>

In 1845, [[Scientific American]], the oldest continuously published magazine in the U.S., began publishing articles about scientific and technological research, with a focus upon the future implications of such research. It would be followed in 1872 by the magazine [[Popular Science]], which was aimed at a more general readership.<ref name=":0" />

The genre of [[science fiction]] became established towards the end of the 19th century, with notable writers, including [[Jules Verne]] and [[H. G. Wells]], setting their stories in an imagined future world.

===Early 20th Century===
[[File:H G Wells pre 1922.jpg|right|thumb|upright|[[H. G. Wells]] first advocated for 'future studies' in a lecture delivered in 1902.]]
According to [[W. Warren Wagar]], the founder of future studies was [[H. G. Wells]]. His ''[[Anticipations|Anticipations of the Reaction of Mechanical and Scientific Progress Upon Human Life and Thought: An Experiment in Prophecy]]'', was first serially published in ''[[The Fortnightly Review]]'' in 1901.<ref name="Wagar">{{Cite web|url=http://www.wnrf.org/cms/hgwells.shtml|title=H.G. Wells and the Genesis of Future Studies|author=W. Warren Wagar|year=1983}}</ref> Anticipating what the world would be like in the year 2000, the book is interesting both for its hits (trains and cars resulting in the dispersion of population from cities to suburbs; moral restrictions declining as men and women seek greater sexual freedom; the defeat of German [[militarism]], the existence of a European Union, and a world order maintained by "English-speaking peoples" based on the urban core between Chicago and New York<ref>''[[Anticipations]]'', p 100-101, 107.</ref>) and its misses (he did not expect successful [[aircraft]] before 1950, and averred that "my imagination refuses to see any sort of submarine doing anything but suffocate its crew and founder at sea").<ref>{{cite web|url=http://humanityplus.org/learn/about-us/wells |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090520001844/http://humanityplus.org/learn/about-us/wells |archive-date=20 May 2009 |title=Annual HG Wells Award for Outstanding Contributions to Transhumanism |date=20 May 2009 |accessdate=10 June 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Turner|first=Frank Miller|title=Contesting Cultural Authority: Essays in Victorian Intellectual Life|url=https://archive.org/details/contestingcultur00turn_392|url-access=limited|year=1993|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-37257-2|pages=[https://archive.org/details/contestingcultur00turn_392/page/n232 219]–20|chapter=Public Science in Britain 1880–1919}}</ref>

Moving from narrow technological predictions, Wells envisioned the eventual collapse of the [[capitalism|capitalist]] world system after a series of destructive [[total war]]s. From this havoc would ultimately emerge a world of peace and plenty, controlled by competent [[technocrat]]s.<ref name="Wagar"/>

The work was a [[bestseller]], and Wells was invited to deliver a lecture at the [[Royal Institution]] in 1902, entitled ''[[The Discovery of the Future]]''. The lecture was well-received and was soon republished in book form. He advocated for the establishment of a new academic study of the future that would be grounded in scientific methodology rather than just speculation. He argued that a scientifically ordered vision of the future "will be just as certain, just as strictly science, and perhaps just as detailed as the picture that has been built up within the last hundred years to make the geological past." Although conscious of the difficulty in arriving at entirely accurate predictions, he thought that it would still be possible to arrive at a "working knowledge of things in the future".<ref name="Wagar"/>

In his fictional works, Wells predicted the invention and use of the [[atomic bomb]] in ''[[The World Set Free]]'' (1914).<ref>{{cite book | author = Richard Rhodes | year = 1986 | title = The Making of the Atomic Bomb | url = https://archive.org/details/makingofatomicbo00rhod | url-access = registration | publisher = Simon & Schuster | location = New York | page = [https://archive.org/details/makingofatomicbo00rhod/page/24 24] | isbn = 978-0-684-81378-3| author-link = Richard Rhodes }}</ref> In ''[[The Shape of Things to Come]]'' (1933) the impending [[World War II|World War]] and cities destroyed by aerial bombardment was depicted.<ref>Cowley, Malcolm. "Outline of Wells's History." ''[[The New Republic]]'' Vol. 81 Issue 1041, 14 November 1934 (p. 22–23).</ref> However, he didn't stop advocating for the establishment of a futures science. In a 1933 [[BBC]] broadcast he called for the establishment of "Departments and Professors of Foresight", foreshadowing the development of modern academic futures studies by approximately 40 years.<ref name="Wells, H.G. 1932 p. 89-91"/>

At the beginning of the 20th century future works were often shaped by political forces and turmoil. The [[World War I|WWI]] era led to adoption of futures thinking in institutions throughout Europe. The [[Russian Revolution]] led to the 1921 establishment of the Soviet Union's [[Gosplan]], or State Planning Committee, which was active until the dissolution of the [[Soviet Union]]. Gosplan was responsible for economic planning and created plans in five year increments to govern the economy. One of the first Soviet dissidents, [[Yevgeny Zamyatin]], published the first [[dystopia]]n novel, ''[[We (novel)|We]]'', in 1921. The science fiction and political satire featured a future police state and was the first work censored by the Soviet censorship board, leading to Zamyatin's political exile.<ref name=":0" />

In the United States, President [[Presidency of Herbert Hoover|Hoover]] created the Research Committee on Social Trends, which produced a report in 1933. The head of the committee, [[William Fielding Ogburn|William F. Ogburn]], analyzed the past to chart trends and project those trends into the future, with a focus on technology. Similar technique was used during [[Great Depression|The Great Depression]], with the addition of alternative futures and a set of likely outcomes that resulted in the creation of [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] and the Tennessee Valley development project.<ref name=":0" />

The [[World War II|WWII]] era emphasized the growing need for foresight. The [[Nazi Party|Nazis]] used strategic plans to unify and mobilize their society with a focus on creating a fascist utopia. This planning and the subsequent war forced global leaders to create their own strategic plans in response. The post-war era saw the creation of numerous nation states with complex political alliances and was further complicated by the introduction of nuclear power.

[[RAND Corporation|Project RAND]] was created in 1946 as joint project between the [[United States Army Air Forces]] and the [[Douglas Aircraft Company]], and later incorporated as the non-profit [[RAND Corporation|RAND corporation]]. Their objective was the future of weapons, and long-range planning to meet future threats. Their work has formed the basis of US strategy and policy in regard to nuclear weapons, the [[Cold War]], and the          space race.<ref name=":0" />

===Mid-Century Emergence===
Futures studies truly emerged as an academic discipline in the mid-1960s.<ref name=":1">{{cite web|url=https://wfs.org/five-decades-of-futuring/|title=World Future Society|website=World Future Society|accessdate=2 May 2018}}</ref> First-generation futurists included [[Herman Kahn]], an American [[Cold War]] strategist for the [[RAND Corporation]] who wrote ''[[On Thermonuclear War]]'' (1960), ''Thinking about the unthinkable'' (1962) and ''The Year 2000: a framework for speculation on the next thirty-three years'' (1967); [[Bertrand de Jouvenel]], a French economist who founded Futuribles International in 1960; and [[Dennis Gabor]], a Hungarian-British scientist who wrote ''Inventing the Future'' (1963) and ''The Mature Society. A View of the Future'' (1972).<ref name="Bell 1997" />

Future studies had a parallel origin with the birth of [[systems science]] in [[academia]], and with the idea of national economic and political [[planning]], most notably in [[France]] and the [[Soviet Union]].<ref name="Bell 1997"/><ref name="Masini 1993">{{cite book| last=Masini| first= Eleonora| year=1993| title=Why Futures Studies?| publisher=Grey Seal Books| location=London, UK}}</ref> In the 1950s, the people of France were continuing to reconstruct their war-torn country. In the process, French scholars, philosophers, writers, and artists searched for what could constitute a more positive future for humanity. The [[Soviet Union]] similarly participated in postwar rebuilding, but did so in the context of an established [[Planned economy|national economic planning process]], which also required a long-term, systemic statement of social goals. Future studies was therefore primarily engaged in national planning, and the construction of national symbols.
[[File:Rachel Carson w (cropped).jpg|thumb|216x216px|[[Rachel Carson]], author of [[Silent Spring|''The Silent Spring'']], which helped launch the environmental movement and a new direction for futures research.]]
By contrast, in the [[United States]], futures studies as a discipline emerged from the successful application of the tools and perspectives of [[systems analysis]], especially with regard to quartermastering the war-effort. The [[International Society for the Systems Sciences|Society for General Systems Research]], founded in 1955, sought to understand [[cybernetics]] and the practical application of systems sciences, greatly influencing the U.S. foresight community.<ref name=":0" /> These differing origins account for an initial schism between futures studies in America and “futurology” in Europe: U.S. practitioners focused on applied projects, quantitative tools and systems analysis, whereas [[Europe]]ans preferred to investigate the long-range future of humanity and the [[Earth]], what might constitute that future, what symbols and [[semantics]] might express it, and who might articulate these.<ref>{{cite book| last=Slaughter| first= Richard A.| year=1995| title=The Foresight Principle: Cultural Recovery in the 21st Century| publisher=Adamantine Press, Ltd.| location=London, England}}</ref><ref name="Sardar 1999">[[Ziauddin Sardar|Sardar, Ziauddin]], ed. (1999). ''Rescuing All Our Futures.'' Praeger Studies on the 21st Century, Westport, Connecticut, USA.</ref>

By the 1960s, academics, philosophers, writers and artists across the globe had begun to explore enough future scenarios so as to fashion a common dialogue. Several of the most notable writers to emerge during this era include: sociologist [[Fred Polak|Fred L. Polak]], whose work ''Images of the Future'' (1961) discusses the importance of images to society's creation of the future; [[Marshall McLuhan]], whose ''[[The Gutenberg Galaxy]]'' (1962) and ''[[Understanding Media|Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man]]'' (1964) put forth his theories on how technologies change our cognitive understanding; and [[Rachel Carson]]’s ''[[Silent Spring|The Silent Spring]]'' (1962) which was hugely influential not only to future studies but also the creation of the environmental movement.<ref name=":0" />

Inventors such as [[Buckminster Fuller]] also began highlighting the effect technology might have on global trends as time progressed.

By the 1970s there was an obvious shift in the use and development of futures studies; its focus was no longer exclusive to governments and militaries. Instead, it embraced a wide array of technologies, social issues, and concerns. This discussion on the intersection of population growth, resource availability and use, economic growth, quality of life, and environmental sustainability&nbsp;&ndash; referred to as the "global problematique"&nbsp;&ndash; came to wide public attention with the publication of ''[[Limits to Growth]]'' by [[Donella Meadows]], a study sponsored by the [[Club of Rome]] which detailed the results of a computer simulation of the future based on economic and population growth.[[Futures studies#cite note-Meadows 1972-22|<sup>[22]</sup>]] Public investment in the future was further enhanced by the publication of [[Alvin & Heidi Toffler]]’s bestseller ''[[Future Shock]]'' (1970), and its exploration of how great amounts of change can overwhelm people and create a social paralysis due to “[[information overload]].”<ref name=":0" />

===Further development===
International dialogue became institutionalized in the form of the [[World Futures Studies Federation]] (WFSF), founded in 1967, with the noted sociologist, [[Johan Galtung]], serving as its first president. In the United States, the publisher [[Edward Cornish]], concerned with these issues, started the [[World Future Society]], an organization focused more on interested laypeople.  The [http://apf.org Association of Professional Futurists] was founded in 2002 and spans 40 countries with more than 400 members.  Their mission is to promote professional excellence by “demonstrating the value of strategic foresight and futures studies.”

The first doctoral program on the Study of the Future, was founded in 1969 at the University Of Massachusetts by Christopher Dede and Billy Rojas. The next graduate program (Master's degree) was also founded by Christopher Dede in 1975 at the [[University of Houston–Clear Lake]],.<ref name="Markley 1998">Markley, Oliver (1998)"Visionary Futures: Guided Imagery in Teaching and Learning about the Future", in ''American Behavioral Scientist''. Sage Publications, New York.</ref> Oliver Markley of SRI (now [[SRI International]]) was hired in 1978 to move the program into a more applied and professional direction. The program moved to the [[University of Houston]] in 2007 and renamed the degree to Foresight.<ref>Peter Bishop & Andy Hines, Teaching about the Future, Houndsmill, UK: Palgrave Macmillan, p.xv.</ref> The program has remained focused on preparing professional futurists and providing high-quality foresight training for individuals and organizations in business, government, education, and non-profits.<ref>Andy Hines, "A training ground for professional futurists," The Futurist, Vol. 43, September/October 2014</ref> In 1976, the M.A. Program in Public Policy in Alternative Futures at the [[University of Hawaii at Manoa]] was established.<ref name="Jones 1992">{{cite journal| last=Jones| first= Christopher|date=Winter 1992| title=The Manoa School of Futures Studies| journal=Futures Research Quarterly| pages=19–25}}</ref> The Hawaii program locates futures studies within a pedagogical space defined by [[neo-Marxism]], critical political [[economic theory]], and [[literary criticism]]. In the years following the foundation of these two programs, single courses in Futures Studies at all levels of education have proliferated, but complete programs occur only rarely.

In 2010, the [[Free University of Berlin]] initiated a master's degree Programme in Futures Studies, which is the first one in Germany.<ref>[https://www.ewi-psy.fu-berlin.de/en/v/master-zukunftsforschung/index.html Master of Arts in Futures Studies] at [[Free University of Berlin]]</ref> In 2012, the Finland Futures Research Centre started a master's degree Programme in Futures Studies at [[Turku School of Economics]], a business school which is part of the [[University of Turku]] in [[Turku]], Finland.<ref name=":5">{{Cite web|title=Finland Futures Research Centre|url=https://www.utu.fi/en/university/turku-school-of-economics/finland-futures-research-centre|access-date=2020-07-13|website=www.utu.fi|language=en}}</ref>

Foresight and futures work cover any domain a company considers important; therefore, a futurist must be able to cross domains and industries in their work. There is continued discussion by people in the profession on how to advance it, with some preferring to keep the field open to anyone interested in the future and others arguing to make the credentialing more rigorous. There are approximately [https://rossdawson.com/futurist/university-foresight-programs/ 23 graduate and PhD programs] in foresight globally, and many other certification courses.

The field currently faces the challenge of creating a coherent conceptual framework, codified into a well-documented curriculum (or curricula) featuring widely accepted and consistent concepts and theoretical paradigms linked to quantitative and qualitative methods, exemplars of those research methods, and guidelines for their ethical and appropriate application within society. As an indication that previously disparate intellectual dialogues have in fact started converging into a recognizable discipline,<ref>Kuhn, Thomas (1975, c1970).

==Probability and predictability==

While understanding the difference between the concepts of probability and predictability are very important to understanding the future, the field of futures studies is generally more focused on long-term futures in which the concept of [[plausibility]] becomes the greater concern.  The usefulness of probability and predictability to the field lies more in analyzing the quantifiable trends and drivers which influence future change, than in predicting future events.

Some aspects of the future, such as [[celestial mechanics]], are highly predictable, and may even be described by relatively simple mathematical models. At present however, science has yielded only a special minority of such "easy to predict" physical processes. Theories such as [[chaos theory]], [[nonlinear]] science and standard [[evolutionary theory]] have allowed us to understand many complex systems as [[contingent]] (sensitively dependent on complex environmental conditions) and [[stochastic]] (random within constraints), making the vast majority of future events unpredictable, ''in any specific case''.

Not surprisingly, the tension between [[predictability]] and [[unpredictability]] is a source of controversy and conflict among futures studies scholars and practitioners. Some argue that the future is essentially unpredictable, and that "the best way to predict the future is to create it." <ref>{{cite web |title=Source of this quote |url=https://quoteinvestigator.com/2012/09/27/invent-the-future/ |website=Quote Investigator}}</ref> Others believe, as Flechtheim, that advances in science, probability, modeling and statistics will allow us to continue to improve our understanding of probable futures, as this area presently remains less well developed than methods for exploring possible and preferable futures.

As an example, consider the process of electing the president of the United States. At one level we observe that any U.S. citizen over 35 may run for president, so this process may appear too unconstrained for useful prediction. Yet further investigation demonstrates that only certain public individuals (current and former presidents and vice presidents, senators, state governors, popular military commanders, mayors of very large cities, celebrities, etc.) receive the appropriate "social credentials" that are historical prerequisites for election. Thus, with a minimum of effort at formulating the problem for statistical prediction, a much-reduced pool of candidates can be described, improving our probabilistic foresight. Applying further statistical intelligence to this problem, we can observe that in certain election [[prediction market]]s such as the [[Iowa Electronic Markets]], reliable forecasts have been generated over long spans of time and conditions, with results superior to individual experts or polls. Such markets, which may be operated publicly or as an [[internal market]], are just one of several promising frontiers in predictive futures research.

Such improvements in the predictability of individual events do not though, from a [[Complex systems|complexity theory]] viewpoint, address the unpredictability inherent in dealing with entire systems, which emerge from the interaction between multiple individual events.

Futurology is sometimes described by scientists as [[pseudoscience]].<ref name="Oxford"/><ref name="Williams"/> Science exists in the realm of the certain and builds knowledge through attempting to falsify predictions.  Futures studies, however, exists in the realm of the uncertain but also builds knowledge through attempting to falsify predictions and exposing uncertainty.<ref name=":3" />  So in a sense, both science and futures studies share the same goal. The difference is that futures studies attempts to understand, mitigate, and utilize uncertainty.

==Methodologies==
{{multiple issues|
{{original research|section|date=November 2015}}

}}
In terms of methodology, futures practitioners employ a wide range of approaches, models and methods, in both theory and practice, many of which are derived from or informed by other academic or professional disciplines [https://books.google.com/books?id=ILJ_pfMgLqsC&pg=PA242&lpg=PA242&dq=futurists+borrow+from+other+disciplines&source=bl&ots=ycoWOEgcIS&sig=J-Nv6SzqAv-DLsGc7608ZuPyV5I&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi31u3GgMHSAhXpj1QKHUxBCOAQ6AEIIzAA#v=onepage&q=futurists%20borrow%2 <nowiki>[1]</nowiki>], including social sciences such as economics, psychology, sociology, religious studies, cultural studies, history, geography, and political science; physical and life sciences such as physics, chemistry, astronomy, biology; mathematics, including statistics, game theory and econometrics; applied disciplines such as engineering, computer sciences, and business management (particularly strategy).

The largest internationally peer-reviewed collection of futures research methods (1,300 pages) is [http://www.millennium-project.org/publications-2/futures-research-methodology-version-3-0/ Futures Research Methodology 3.0]. Each of the 37 methods or groups of methods contains: an executive overview of each method's history, description of the method, primary and alternative usages, strengths and weaknesses, uses in combination with other methods, and speculation about future evolution of the method. Some also contain appendixes with applications, links to software, and sources for further information. More recent method books, such as [https://www.amazon.co.uk/How-explore-our-futures-research/dp/9519885269 "How Do We Explore Our Futures?]" have also been published.

Given its unique objectives and material, the practice of futures studies only rarely features employment of the [[scientific method]] in the sense of controlled, repeatable and verifiable experiments with highly standardized methodologies. However, many futurists are informed by scientific techniques or work primarily within scientific domains. Borrowing from history, the futurist might project patterns observed in past civilizations upon present-day society to model what might happen in the future, or borrowing from technology, the futurist may model possible social and cultural responses to an emerging technology based on established principles of the diffusion of innovation. In short, the futures practitioner enjoys the synergies of an interdisciplinary laboratory.

As the plural term “futures” suggests, one of the fundamental assumptions in futures studies is that the future is plural not singular.[http://www.futures.hawaii.edu/publications/futures-studies/DatorFuturesStudies.pdf <nowiki>[2]</nowiki>] That is, the future consists not of one inevitable future that is to be “predicted,” but rather of multiple alternative futures of varying likelihood which may be derived and described, and about which it is impossible to say with certainty which one will occur. The primary effort in futures studies, then, is to identify and describe alternative futures in order to better understand the driving forces of the present or the structural dynamics of a particular subject or subjects. The exercise of identifying alternative futures includes collecting quantitative and qualitative data about the possibility, probability, and desirability of change. The plural term "futures" in futures studies denotes both the rich variety of alternative futures, including the subset of preferable futures (normative futures), that can be studied, as well as the tenet that the future is many.

At present, the general futures studies model has been summarized as being concerned with "three Ps and a W", or possible, probable, and preferable futures, plus [[Wild card (Foresight research)|wildcards]], which are unexpected, seemingly low probability but high impact events (positive or negative).<ref>{{Cite book|last=Casti|first=John|title=X-Events: Complexity Overload and the Collapse of Everything|publisher=William Morrow Paperbacks|year=2013|isbn=978-0062088291}}</ref> Many futurists do not use the wild card approach. Rather, they use a methodology called [[Emerging Issues Analysis]]. It searches for the drivers of change, issues that are likely to move from unknown to the known, from low impact to high impact.

In terms of technique, futures practitioners originally concentrated on [[Extrapolation|extrapolating]] present [[technological]], [[economic]] or [[social]] [[Fads and trends|trends]], or on attempting to [[Prediction|predict]] future trends. Over time, the discipline has come to put more and more focus on the examination of social [[system]]s and [[Uncertainty|uncertainties]], to the end of articulating [[Scenario planning|scenarios]]. The practice of scenario development facilitates the examination of worldviews and assumptions through the [[causal layered analysis]] method (and others), the creation of preferred visions of the future, and the use of exercises such as [[backcasting]] to connect the present with alternative futures. Apart from extrapolation and scenarios, many dozens of methods and techniques are used in futures research (see below).

Therefore, the general practice of futures studies also sometimes includes the articulation of normative or preferred futures, and a major thread of practice involves connecting both extrapolated (exploratory) and normative research to assist individuals and organizations to model preferred futures amid shifting social changes. For instance, despite many wicked, global challenges in today's world from climate change to extreme poverty, the aspect of preferability or "what should happen" can at times be overlooked. Practitioners use varying proportions of collaboration, creativity and research to derive and define alternative futures, and to the degree that a “preferred” future might be sought, especially in an organizational context, techniques may also be deployed to develop plans or strategies for directed future shaping or implementation of a preferred future.

While some futurists are not concerned with assigning probability to future scenarios, other futurists find probabilities useful in certain situations, such as when probabilities stimulate thinking about scenarios within organizations [https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/2870/f9cef0b618c480312802fbb78e49bd69fa83.pdf <nowiki>[3]</nowiki>]. When dealing with the three Ps and a W model, estimates of probability are involved with two of the four central concerns (discerning and classifying both probable and wildcard events), while considering the range of possible futures, recognizing the plurality of existing alternative futures, characterizing and attempting to resolve normative disagreements on the future, and envisioning and creating preferred futures are other major areas of scholarship. Most estimates of probability in futures studies are normative and qualitative, though significant progress on statistical and quantitative methods (technology and information growth curves, cliometrics, predictive psychology, [[prediction market]]s, crowd-voting forecasts,<sup>[31][''[[Wikipedia:NOTRS|better source needed]]'']</sup> etc.) has been made in recent decades.

=== Futures techniques ===
{{Main|Futures techniques}}

Futures techniques or methodologies may be viewed as “frameworks for making sense of data generated by structured processes to think about the future”.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/768c/525942ae89e6364569875090b87b449abeb2.pdf|title=An Overview of Foresight Methodologies|last=Conway|first=Maree|accessdate=25 February 2018}}</ref> There is no single set of methods that are appropriate for all futures research. Different futures researchers intentionally or unintentionally promote use of favored techniques over a more structured approach. Selection of methods for use on futures research projects has so far been dominated by the intuition and insight of practitioners; but can better identify a balanced selection of techniques via acknowledgement of foresight as a process together with familiarity with the fundamental attributes of most commonly used methods.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Popper|first=Rafael|date=2008|title=How are foresight methods selected?|journal=Foresight|volume=10|issue=6|pages=62–89|doi=10.1108/14636680810918586}}</ref>
Scenarios are a central technique in Futures Studies and are often confused with other techniques. The flowchart to the right provides a process for classifying a phenomenon as a scenario in the intuitive logics tradition.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Spaniol |first1=Matthew J. |last2=Rowland |first2=Nicholas J. |title=Defining Scenario |journal=Futures & Foresight Science |volume=1 |pages=e3 |doi=10.1002/ffo2.3 |year=2018 |doi-access=free }}</ref>[[File:Flowchartv11png.png|thumb|Process for classifying a phenomenon as a scenario in the Intuitive Logics tradition.]]

===Shaping alternative futures===
Futurists use scenarios&nbsp;&ndash; alternative possible futures&nbsp;&ndash; as an important tool. To some extent, people can determine what they consider probable or desirable using qualitative and quantitative methods. By looking at a variety of possibilities one comes closer to shaping the future, rather than merely predicting it. Shaping alternative futures starts by establishing a number of scenarios. Setting up scenarios takes place as a process with many stages, and can take place in an evidence-based manner. Scenarios can also study unlikely and improbable developments that would otherwise be ignored. However, for credibility, they should not be entirely utopian or dystopian. One of those stages involves the study of emerging issues, such as '''megatrends''', '''trends''' and '''weak signals'''. Megatrends illustrate major, long-term phenomena that change slowly, are often interlinked and cannot be transformed in an instant.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Megatrends|url=https://www.sitra.fi/en/topics/megatrends/|access-date=2020-07-13|website=Sitra|language=en-GB}}</ref> Trends express an increase or a decrease in a phenomenon, and there are many ways to spot trends. Some argue that a trend persists long-term and long-range; affects many societal groups; grows slowly; and appears to have a profound basis. A fad operates in the short term, shows the vagaries of [[fashion]], affects particular societal groups, and spreads quickly but superficially.

Futurists have a decidedly mixed reputation and a patchy track record at successful prediction. Many 1950s futurists predicted commonplace [[space tourism]] by the year 2000, but ignored the possibilities of ubiquitous, cheap [[computer]]s. On the other hand, many forecasts have portrayed the future with some degree of accuracy. Sample predicted futures range from predicted [[ecological catastrophe]]s, through a [[utopia]]n future where the poorest human being lives in what present-day observers would regard as wealth and comfort, through the transformation of humanity into a [[posthumanism|posthuman]] life-form, to the destruction of all life on Earth in, say, a [[nanotechnology|nanotechnological]] [[Gray goo|disaster]]. For reasons of convenience, futurists have often extrapolated present technical and societal trends and assumed they will develop at the same rate into the future; but technical progress and social upheavals, in reality, take place in fits and starts and in different areas at different rates. 

Therefore, to some degree, the field has aimed to move away from prediction. Current futurists often present multiple [[scenario]]s that help their audience envision what "may" occur instead of merely "predicting the future". They claim that understanding potential scenarios helps individuals and organizations prepare with flexibility.

Many corporations use futurists as part of their [[risk management]] strategy, for [[horizon scanning]] and emerging issues analysis, and to identify [[Wild card (Foresight research)|wild card]]s &ndash; low probability, potentially high-impact risks.<ref>A [http://www.globalchange.com/ppt4/risk/ sample presentation on risk management]</ref> Understanding a range of possibilities can enhance the recognition of opportunities and threats. Every successful and unsuccessful [[business]] engages in futuring to some degree &ndash; for example in research and development, innovation and market research, anticipating competitor behavior and so on.<ref name="rohrbeck-2010">Rohrbeck, Rene (2010) ''Corporate Foresight: Towards a Maturity Model for the Future Orientation of a Firm'', Springer Series: Contributions to Management Science, Heidelberg and New York, {{ISBN|978-3-7908-2625-8}}</ref><ref name="rohrbeck-gemuenden-2010">Rohrbeck, R. H.G. Gemuenden (2010) [http://ssrn.com/abstract=1618523 Corporate Foresight: Its Three Roles in Enhancing the Innovation Capacity of a Firm"] ''Technological Forecasting and Social Change'', forthcoming</ref>

===Weak signals, the future sign and wild cards===

In futures research "weak signals" may be understood as advanced, noisy and socially situated indicators of change in trends and systems that constitute raw informational material for enabling anticipatory action. There is some confusion about the definition of weak signal by various researchers and consultants. Sometimes it is referred as future oriented information, sometimes more like emerging issues. The confusion has been partly clarified with the concept 'the future sign', by separating signal, issue and interpretation of the future sign.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.futures.2007.08.021 |title=The future sign and its three dimensions  }}</ref>

A weak signal can be an early indicator of coming change, and an example might also help clarify the confusion. On May 27, 2012, hundreds of people gathered for a “Take the Flour Back” demonstration at Rothamsted Research in Harpenden, UK, to oppose a publicly funded trial of genetically modified wheat. This was a weak signal for a broader shift in consumer sentiment against genetically modified foods. When Whole Foods mandated the labeling of GMOs in 2013, this non-GMO idea had already become a trend and was about to be a topic of mainstream awareness.

"Wild cards" refer to low-probability and high-impact events "that happen quickly" and "have huge sweeping consequences," and materialize too quickly for social systems to effectively respond.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hiltunen|first=Elina|date=November 2006|title=Was it Wild Card or Just Our Blindness to Gradual Change?|journal=Journal of Futures Studies|volume=11(2)|pages=61–74}}</ref>  Elina Hultunen notes that wild cards are not new, though they have become more prevalent.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Petersen|date=1999|title=Out of the Blue: How to Anticipate Big Future Surprises (as referenced in Hiltunen, Elena, Was it Wild Card or Just Our Blindness to Gradual Change?)|journal=Journal of Futures Studies|volume=11(2)|pages=61–74}}</ref> One reason for this maybe the increasingly fast pace of change.<ref>{{Cite web|last=https://kurzweilai.net|title=Wild Cards: The Nature of Big Future Surprises « Kurzweil|url=https://www.kurzweilai.net/wild-cards-the-nature-of-big-future-surprises|access-date=2020-07-13|language=en-US}}</ref> Oliver Markley proposed four types of wild cards:<ref name=":4">{{Cite journal|last=Markley|first=Oliver|date=2011|title=A new methodology for anticipating STEEP surprises|journal=Technological Forecasting & Social Change|volume=78(2011)|pages=1079–1097}}</ref>

* Type I Wild Card: low probability, high impact, high credibility
* Type II Wild Card: high probability, high impact, low credibility
* Type III Wild Card: high probability, high impact, disputed credibility
* Type IV Wild Card: high probability, high impact, high credibility

He posits that it is important to track the emergence of "Type II Wild Cards" that have a high probability of occurring, but low credibility that it will happen.  This focus is especially important to note because it is often difficult to persuade people to accept something they don't believe is happening, until they see the wild card.  An example is climate change.  This hypothesis has gone from Type I (high impact and high credibility, but low probability where science was accepted and thought unlikely to happen) to Type II (high probability, high impact, but low credibility as policy makers and lobbyists push back against the science), to Type III (high probability, high impact, high credibility)--at least for most people,  There are still some who probably will not accept the science until the Greenland ice sheet has completely melted and sea-level has risen the seven meters estimated rise.

This concept may be embedded in standard foresight projects and introduced into anticipatory decision-making activity in order to increase the ability of social groups adapt to surprises arising in turbulent business environments. Such sudden and unique incidents might constitute turning points in the evolution of a certain trend or system. Wild cards may or may not be announced by weak signals, which are incomplete and fragmented data from which relevant foresight information might be inferred. Sometimes, mistakenly, wild cards and weak signals are considered as synonyms, which they are not.<ref>[http://www.jfs.tku.edu.tw/11-2/4wildcard-hiltunen.pdf differences of weak signals and wild cards]</ref> One of the most often cited examples of a wild card event in recent history is 9/11. Nothing had happened in the past that could point to such a possibility and yet it had a huge impact on everyday life in the United States, from simple tasks like how to travel via airplane to deeper cultural values. Wild card events might also be natural disasters, such as Hurricane Katrina, which can force the relocation of huge populations and wipe out entire crops or completely disrupt the supply chain of many businesses. Although wild card events can't be predicted, after they occur it is often easy to reflect back and convincingly explain why they happened.

===Near-term predictions===
A long-running tradition in various [[culture]]s, and especially in the [[Mass media|media]], involves various spokespersons making predictions for the upcoming year at the beginning of the year. These [[prediction]]s are thought-provokers, which sometimes base themselves on current trends in culture (music, movies, fashion, politics); sometimes they make hopeful guesses as to what major events might take place over the course of the next year. Evidently, some of these predictions may come true as the year unfolds, though many fail. When predicted events fail to take place, the authors of the [[prediction]]s may state that misinterpretation of the "[[sign (semiotics)|signs]]" and [[Portent (divination)|portent]]s may explain the failure of the prediction.

[[Marketing|Marketer]]s have increasingly started to embrace futures studies, in an effort to benefit from an increasingly competitive marketplace with fast production cycles, using such techniques as [[trend analysis|trendspotting]] as popularized by [[Faith Popcorn]].{{Dubious|date=December 2011}}

=== Trend analysis and forecasting ===

==== Megatrends ====
Trends come in different sizes. A megatrend extends over many generations, and in cases of climate, megatrends can cover periods prior to human existence. They describe complex interactions between many factors. The increase in population from the [[palaeolithic]] period to the present provides an example. Megatrends are likely to produce greater change than any previous one, because technology is causing trends to unfold at an accelerating pace.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Norton|first=Leslie P.|date=Dec 27, 2019|title=The 2020s Will Bring Massive Change. Why Society Might Not Be Ready|journal=Barron's|volume=(Online); New York (Dec 27, 2019)|via=ProQuest}}</ref> The concept was popularized by the 1982 book Megatrends by futurist [[John Naisbitt]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Naisbitt |first1=John |title=Megatrends: Ten New Directions Transforming Our Lives. Warner Books |date=1982 |publisher=Warner Communications |isbn=978-0-446-35681-7}}</ref>

==== Potential trends ====
Possible new trends grow from innovations, projects, beliefs or actions and activism that have the potential to grow and eventually go mainstream in the future.

==== Branching trends ====
Very often, trends relate to one another the same way as a tree-trunk relates to branches and twigs. For example, a well-documented movement toward equality between men and women might represent a branch trend. The trend toward reducing differences in the salaries of men and women in the [[Western world]] could form a twig on that branch.

==== Life cycle of a trend ====
Understanding the technology adoption cycle helps futurists monitor trend development. Trends start as weak signals by small mentions in fringe media outlets, discussion conversations or blog posts, often by innovators. As these ideas, projects, beliefs or technologies gain acceptance, they move into the phase of early adopters.  
In the beginning of a trend's development, it is difficult to tell if it will become a significant trend that creates changes or merely a trendy fad that fades into forgotten history. Trends will emerge as initially unconnected dots but eventually coalesce into persistent change.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Webb |first1=Amy |title=The Signals Are Talking |date=2016 |publisher=PublicAffairs |location=New York |isbn=9781610396660 |pages=47–50 |edition=1st}}</ref>

Some trends emerge when enough confirmation occurs in the various media, surveys or questionnaires to show that it has an increasingly accepted value, behavior or technology, it becomes accepted as a bona fide trend. Trends can also gain confirmation by the existence of other trends perceived as springing from the same branch. Some commentators claim that when 15% to 25% of a given population integrates an innovation, project, belief or action into their daily life then a trend becomes mainstream.

[[File:Hype-Cycle-General.png|thumb|[[Hype cycle|General Hype Cycle]] used to visualize [[Technology adoption life cycle|technological life stages]] of maturity, adoption, and social application.]]

==== Life cycle of technologies ====

[[Gartner]] created their [[Hype cycle|Hype Cycle]] to illustrate the phases a technology moves through as it grows from research and development to mainstream adoption. The unrealistic expectations and subsequent disillusionment that virtual reality experienced in the 1990s and early 2000s is an example of the middle phases encountered before a technology can begin to be integrated into society.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://projects.ict.usc.edu/mxr/blog/keynote-remixed-what-happened-to-virtual-reality/|title=Keynote Remixed: What Happened to Virtual Reality}}</ref>

== Education ==
Education in the field of futures studies has taken place for some time. Beginning in the [[United States]] in the 1960s, it has since developed in many different countries. Futures education encourages the use of concepts, tools and processes that allow students to think long-term, consequentially, and imaginatively. It generally helps students to:
# conceptualize more just and sustainable human and planetary futures.
# develop knowledge and skills of methods and tools used to help people understand, map, and influence the future by exploring probable and preferred futures.
# understand the dynamics and influence that human, social and ecological systems have on alternative futures.
# conscientize [[Social responsibility|responsibility]] and action on the part of students toward creating better futures.
Thorough documentation of the history of futures education exists, for example in the work of [[Richard A. Slaughter]] (2004),<ref name="Slaughter 2004">{{cite book| last=Slaughter| first= Richard A.| year=2004| title=Futures Beyond Dystopia: Creating Social Foresight| publisher=RoutledgeFalmer| location=London}}</ref> David Hicks, Ivana Milojević<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.metafuture.org/articlesbyivana.htm |title=Articles by Ivana Milojevic; Futures Studies at Metafuture.org |work=metafuture.org |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091114063552/http://www.metafuture.org/articlesbyivana.htm |archive-date=2009-11-14 }}</ref> to name a few.

While futures studies remains a relatively new academic tradition, numerous tertiary institutions around the world teach it. These vary from small programs, or universities with just one or two classes, to programs that offer certificates and incorporate futures studies into other degrees, (for example in [[planning]], business, environmental studies, [[economics]], development studies, [[science]] and technology studies). Various formal Masters-level programs exist on six continents. Finally, doctoral dissertations around the world have incorporated futures studies (see e.g. Rohrbeck, 2010;<ref>Rohrbeck, R. (2010) ''Corporate Foresight: Towards a Maturity Model for the Future Orientation of a Firm''. [[Dissertation]]. Springer, {{ISBN|978-3-7908-2625-8}}

A Futures Studies program is offered at [[Tamkang University]], Taiwan. Futures Studies is a required course at the undergraduate level, with between three and five thousand students taking classes on an annual basis. Housed in the Graduate Institute of Futures Studies is an MA Program. Only ten students are accepted annually in the program. Associated with the program is the ''Journal of Futures Studies''.<ref name=JFS>{{cite web|title=Journal of Future Studies|url=http://www.jfs.tku.edu.tw/|publisher=Graduate Institute of Futures Studies, Tamkang University|location=Tamsui, Taipei, Taiwan.|access-date=2008-01-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071208062208/http://www.jfs.tku.edu.tw/|archive-date=2007-12-08|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The longest running Future Studies program in North America was established in 1975 at the [[University of Houston–Clear Lake]].<ref>Teaching about the Future, by Peter C. Bishop and Andy Hines, 2012</ref> It moved to the [[University of Houston]] in 2007 and renamed the degree to Foresight. The program was established on the belief that if history is studied and taught in an academic setting, then so should the future. Its mission is to prepare professional futurists. The curriculum incorporates a blend of the essential theory, a framework and methods for doing the work, and a focus on application for clients in business, government, nonprofits, and society in general.<ref>Hines. A. (2014, September/October). A training ground for professional futurists. The Futurist, 43.</ref>

As of 2003, over 40 tertiary education establishments around the world were delivering one or more courses in futures studies.

== Applications of foresight and specific fields ==

===General applicability and use of foresight products===

Several corporations and government agencies utilize foresight products to both better understand potential risks and prepare for potential opportunities as an anticipatory approach. Several government agencies publish material for internal stakeholders as well as make that material available to broader public. Examples of this include the US Congressional Budget Office long term budget projections,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cbo.gov/publication/45308|title=Long-Term Budget Projections|work=Congressional Budget Office}}</ref> the National Intelligence Center,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dni.gov/index.php/about/organization/national-intelligence-council-global-trends|title=National Intelligence Council|author=Super User|work=dni.gov|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150301030845/http://www.dni.gov/index.php/about/organization/national-intelligence-council-global-trends|archive-date=2015-03-01}}</ref> and the United Kingdom Government Office for Science.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/foresight-projects|title=Foresight projects|work=www.gov.uk}}</ref> Much of this material is used by policy makers to inform policy decisions and government agencies to develop long-term plan. Several corporations, particularly those with long product development lifecycles, utilize foresight and future studies products and practitioners in the development of their business strategies. The Shell Corporation is one such entity.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.shell.com/global/future-energy/scenarios.html |title=Shell Scenarios |work=shell.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150307044027/http://www.shell.com/global/future-energy/scenarios.html |archive-date=2015-03-07 }}</ref> Foresight professionals and their tools are increasingly being used in both the private and public areas to help leaders deal with an increasingly complex and interconnected world.

===Imperial cycles and world order===

Imperial cycles represent an "expanding pulsation" of "mathematically describable" macro-historic trend.<ref>Hornell Hart, "The Logistic Growth of Political Areas," ''Social Forces'', 26, (1948): 396-7; [[Raoul Naroll]], "Imperial Cycles and World Order," ''Peace Research Society'', 7, (1967): 100-101.</ref>

Chinese philosopher [[K'ang Yu-wei]] and French demographer [[Georges Vacher de Lapouge]] stressed in the late 19th century that the trend cannot proceed indefinitely on the finite surface of the globe. The trend is bound to culminate in a world empire. K'ang Yu-wei predicted that the matter will be decided in a contest between Washington and Berlin; Vacher de Lapouge foresaw this contest as being between the United States and Russia and wagered the odds were in the United States' favour.<ref>[[K'ang Yu-wei]], ''The One World Philosophy'', (tr. Thompson, Lawrence G., London, 1958), pp 79-80, 85; George [[Vacher de Lapouge]], ''L'Aryen: Son Rôle Social'', (Nantes: 1899), chapter " L`Avenir des Aryens."</ref> Both published their futures studies before [[H. G. Wells]] introduced the science of future in his ''[[Anticipations]]'' (1901).

Four later anthropologists—Hornell Hart, [[Raoul Naroll]], Louis Morano, and [[Robert Carneiro]]—researched the expanding imperial cycles. They reached the same conclusion that a world empire is not only pre-determined but close at hand and attempted to estimate the time of its appearance.<ref>Hornell, Hart, "The Logistic Growth of Political Areas," ''Social Forces'', 26, (1948): 396-408;  
Raoul, Naroll, "Imperial Cycles and World Order," ''Peace Research Society'', 7, (1967): 83-101;
Louis A., Marano, "A Macrohistoric Trend Towards World Government", ''Behavior Science Notes'', 8, (1973): 35-40;
Robert Carneiro, "Political Expansion as an Expression of the Principle of Competitive Exclusion", ''Studying War: Anthropological Perspective'', eds. Reyna, Stephen P. & Dawns, Richard Erskine, Gordon and Breach, New Hampshire, 1994;
Robert Carneiro, "The Political Unification of the World", ''Cross Cultural Survey'', 38/2, (2004), 162-177.</ref>

===Education===
As foresight has expanded to include a broader range of social concerns all levels and types of education have been addressed, including formal and informal education. Many countries are beginning to implement Foresight in their Education policy. A few programs are listed below:
* Finland's FinnSight 2015<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aka.fi/Tiedostot/Tiedostot/Julkaisut/Finnsight_2015_EN.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-03-02 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101105090726/http://www.aka.fi/Tiedostot/Tiedostot/Julkaisut/Finnsight_2015_EN.pdf |archive-date=2010-11-05 }}</ref> - Implementation began in 2006 and though at the time was not referred to as "Foresight" they tend to display the characteristics of a foresight program.
* Singapore's Ministry of Education Master plan for Information Technology in Education<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.moe.gov.sg/media/press/2008/08/moe-launches-third-masterplan.php |title=Ministry of Education, Singapore: Press Releases - MOE Launches Third Masterplan for ICT in Education |work=moe.gov.sg |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150318213142/http://www.moe.gov.sg/media/press/2008/08/moe-launches-third-masterplan.php |archive-date=2015-03-18 }}</ref> - This third Masterplan continues what was built on in the 1st and 2nd plans to transform learning environments to equip students to compete in a [[knowledge economy]].
*The World Future Society, founded in 1966, is the largest and longest-running community of futurists in the world. WFS established and built futurism from the ground up—through publications, global summits, and advisory roles to world leaders in business and government.<ref name=":1" />

By the early 2000s, educators began to independently institute futures studies (sometimes referred to as futures thinking) lessons in K-12 classroom environments.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Strong|first1=Kay|last2=Bishop|first2=Peter|title=Case Study: Futurizing the K-12 Teaching Practice|url=http://jfsdigital.org/articles-and-essays/2011-2/vol-15-no-4-june/symposium/case-study-futurizing-the-k-12-teaching-practice|website=Journal of Futures Studies|publisher=Tamkang University, Tamsui Campus|accessdate=23 February 2018|date=2011-06-05}}</ref> To meet the need, non-profit futures organizations designed curriculum plans to supply educators with materials on the topic. Many of the curriculum plans were developed to meet [[Common Core State Standards Initiative|common core standards]]. Futures studies education methods for youth typically include age-appropriate collaborative activities, games, systems thinking and scenario building exercises.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Mack|first1=Timothy C.|title=Good Roads and Potholes: Teaching Foresight to Younger Children|url=http://jfsdigital.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/154-S05.pdf|publisher=Journal of Futures Studies|accessdate=25 February 2018}}</ref>

There are several organizations devoted to furthering the advancement of Foresight and Future Studies worldwide.  [https://www.teachthefuture.org/ Teach the Future] emphasizes foresight educational practices appropriate for K-12 schools. The [https://www.houstonforesight.org/ University of Houston] has a Master's (MS) level graduate program through the College of Technology as well as a certificate program for those interested in advanced studies. The Department of Political Science at the University of Hawaii Manoa has the [http://www.futures.hawaii.edu/ Hawaii Research Center for Future Studies] which offers a Master's (MA) in addition to a Doctorate (Ph.D.).

===Science fiction===
Wendell Bell and Ed Cornish acknowledge science fiction as a catalyst to future studies, conjuring up visions of tomorrow.<ref name="Morgan, Matthew J 2003">Morgan, Matthew J. "On the Fringes: Future Opportunities for Futures Studies." Futures Research Quarterly 19.3 (2003): 5-20. Web. 4 March 2015</ref> Science fiction's potential to provide an “imaginative social vision” is its contribution to futures studies and public perspective. Productive sci-fi presents plausible, normative scenarios.<ref name="Morgan, Matthew J 2003"/> Jim Dator attributes the foundational concepts of “images of the future” to Wendell Bell, for clarifying Fred Polak's concept in Images of the Future, as it applies to futures studies.<ref>Dator, Jim. "Wendell Bell: The Futurist Who Would Put My Grandmother in Prison.” Futures 43.6 (2011): 578-82. Web. 4 May 2015</ref><ref name="Polak, Fred 1973">Polak, Fred, and Boulding, Elise. The Image of the Future. (1973). Print.</ref> Similar to futures studies’ scenarios thinking, empirically supported visions of the future are a window into what the future could be. However, unlike in futures studies, most science fiction works present a single alternative, unless the narrative deals with multiple timelines or alternative realities, such as in the works of [[Philip K. Dick|Phillip K. Dick]], and a multitude of small and big screen works.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/ct-alt-history-usa-ae-0115-20170112-column.html|title=Alternate timelines and side-by-side universes no longer just for science fiction|last=Borrelli|first=Christopher|website=chicagotribune.com|language=en-US|access-date=2019-02-24}}</ref> Pamela Sargent states, “Science fiction reflects attitudes typical of this century.” She gives a brief history of impactful sci-fi publications, like [[Foundation series|The Foundation Trilogy]], by [[Isaac Asimov]] and Starship Troopers, by [[Robert A. Heinlein]].<ref name="Sargent Pamela 1975 pp. 433-441">Women in science fiction. Sargent Pamela.

[[Science fiction prototyping|Brian David Johnson]] is a futurist and author who uses science fiction to help build the future. He has been a futurist at Intel, and is now the resident futurist at Arizona State University. “His work is called ‘future casting’—using ethnographic field studies, technology research, trend data, and even science fiction to create a pragmatic vision of consumers and computing.” Brian David Johnson has developed a practical guide to utilizing science fiction as a tool for futures studies. [[Science fiction prototyping|Science Fiction Prototyping]] combines the past with the present, including interviews with notable science fiction authors to provide the tools needed to “design the future with science fiction.”

Science Fiction Prototyping has five parts:<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|url=https://www.instructables.com/id/Creative-Robotix-Science-Fiction-Prototyping-TimEE/|website=www.instructables.com|access-date=2020-02-23|title=Creative Robotix - Science Fiction Prototyping - TimEE}}</ref>

1.     Pick your science concept and build an imaginative world

2.     The scientific inflection point

3.     The consequences, for better, or worse, or both, of the science or technology on the people and your world

4.     The human inflection point

5.     Reflection, what did we learn?

“A full Science Fiction Prototyping (SFP) is 6-12 pages long, with a popular structure being; an introduction, background work, the fictional story (the bulk of the SFP), a short summary and a summary (reflection). Most often science fiction prototypes extrapolate current science forward and, therefore, include a set of references at the end.”<ref name=":2" />

Ian Miles reviews The New Encyclopedia of Science Fiction,” identifying ways Science Fiction and Futures Studies “cross-fertilize, as well as the ways in which they differ distinctly.” Science Fiction cannot be simply considered fictionalized Futures Studies. It may have aims other than foresight or “prediction, and be no more concerned with shaping the future than any other genre of literature.” <ref>Fiction and forecasting. Ian Miles. (1990) Futures,  22  (1), pp. 83-91</ref> It is not to be understood as an explicit pillar of futures studies, due to its inconsistency of integrated futures research. Additionally, Dennis Livingston, a literature and Futures journal critic says, “The depiction of truly alternative societies has not been one of science fiction’s strong points, especially” preferred, normative envisages.<ref>Science Fiction Survey. Dennis Livingston. Futures, Volume 4, Issue 1, March 1972, Pages 97-98</ref> The strengths of the genre as a form of futurist thinking are discussed by Tom Lombardo, who argues that select science fiction "combines a highly detailed and concrete level of realism with theoretical speculation on the future", "addresses all the main dimensions of the future and synthesizes all these dimensions into integrative visions of the future", and "reflects contemporary and futurist thinking", therefore it "can be viewed as the mythology of the future."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.centerforfutureconsciousness.com/pdf_files/Readings/ScienceFictionShortArticleJuly2005.pdf|title=Science Fiction as the Mythology of the Future|last=Lombardo|first=Tom|date=July 2005|website=Center for Future Consciousness|access-date=February 25, 2019}}</ref>

It is notable that although there are no hard limits on horizons in future studies and foresight efforts, typical future horizons explored are within the realm of the practical and do not span more than a few decades.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Futures Toolkit: Tools for Futures Thinking and Foresight Across UK Government|publisher=UK Government Office of Science|year=2017|pages=3}}</ref> Nevertheless, there are hard science fiction works that can be applicable as visioning exercises that span longer periods of time when the topic is of a significant time scale, such as is in the case of [[Kim Stanley Robinson]]'s [[Mars trilogy|Mars Trilogy]], which deals with the terraforming of Mars and extends two centuries forward through the early 23rd century.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/story/kim-stanley-robinson-red-moon/|title=The Sci-Fi Novelist Who Writes Like the Past to Warn of the Future|last=Rogers|first=Adam|date=2018-10-22|work=Wired|access-date=2019-02-24|issn=1059-1028}}</ref> In fact, there is some overlap between science fiction writers and professional futurists such as in the case of [[David Brin]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://innotechtoday.com/davidbrin/|title=David Brin, Our Conversation with a Futurist|date=2016-12-13|website=Innovation & Tech Today|language=en-US|access-date=2019-02-24}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.davidbrin.com/|title=worlds of David Brin|website=www.davidbrin.com|access-date=2019-02-24}}</ref> Arguably, the work of science fiction authors has seeded many ideas that have later been developed (be it technological or social in nature) - from early works of Jules Verne and H.G. Wells to the later [[Arthur C. Clarke]] and [[William Gibson]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://rossdawson.com/blog/savvy-sci-fi-futurists-21-science-fiction-writers-who-predicted-inventions-way-ahead-of-their-time/|title=Savvy sci-fi futurists: 21 science fiction writers who predicted inventions way ahead of their time|last=Cartwright|first=Vanessa|date=2015-09-19|website=Ross Dawson|language=en-US|access-date=2019-02-24}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://futurism.media/science-fiction-novels-that-have-predicted-the-future|title=Science Fiction Novels That Have Predicted the Future|website=futurism.media|access-date=2019-02-24}}</ref> Beyond literary works, futures studies and futurists have influenced film and TV works. The 2002 movie adaptation of Phillip K.

Science Fiction novels for Futurists:
* William Gibson, [[Neuromancer]], Ace Books, 1984. (Pioneering cyberpunk novel)
* Kim Stanley Robinson, [[Red Mars]], Spectra, 1993. (Story on the founding a colony on Mars)
* Bruce Sterling, [[Heavy Weather (Sterling novel)|Heavy Weather]], Bantam, 1994. (Story about a world with drastically altered climate and weather)
* Iain Banks’ [[Culture series|Culture novels]] (Space operas in distance future with thoughtful treatments of advanced AI)

=== Government agencies ===
Several governments have formalized strategic foresight agencies to encourage long range strategic societal planning, with most notable are the governments of Singapore, Finland, and the United Arab Emirates. Other governments with strategic foresight agencies include Canada's [http://www.horizons.gc.ca/en Policy Horizons Canada] and the [[Malaysian Industry-Government Group for High Technology#myForesight® (Malaysian Foresight Institute)|Malaysia's Malaysian Foresight Institute]].

The Singapore government's [[Centre for Strategic Futures]] (CSF) is part of the Strategy Group within the Prime Minister's Office. Their mission is to position the Singapore government to navigate emerging strategic challenges and harness potential opportunities.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.csf.gov.sg/about-us/vision-mission|title=Singapore Centre for Strategic Futures Mission|date=3 July 2015|website=Centre for Strategic Futures, Singapore|access-date=24 February 2017}}</ref> Singapore's early formal efforts in strategic foresight began in 1991 with the establishment of the Risk Detection and Scenario Planning Office in the Ministry of Defence.<ref name=Kuosa2011>{{cite book|last1=Kuosa|first1=Tuoma|title=Practising Strategic Foresight in Government: The Case of Finland, Singapore, and the European Union|publisher=S.

In the United Arab Emirates, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid, Vice President and Ruler of Dubai,  announced in September 2016 that all government ministries were to appoint Directors of Future Planning.

In 2018, the United States General Accountability Office (GAO) created the Center for Strategic Foresight to enhance its ability to “serve as the agency’s principal hub for identifying, monitoring, and analyzing emerging issues facing policymakers.” The Center is composed of non-resident Fellows who are considered leading experts in foresight, planning and future thinking.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gao.gov/about/what-gao-does/audit-role/csf|title=Center for Strategic Foresight}}</ref> In September 2019 they hosted a conference on space policy and “deep fake” synthetic media to manipulate online and real-world interactions.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.gao.gov/press-release/deep-space-deep-fakes-new-center-strategic-foresight-launched|title= Deep Space & Deep Fakes: New “Center for Strategic Foresight” Launched |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200218155523/https://www.gao.gov/press-release/deep-space-deep-fakes-new-center-strategic-foresight-launched |archive-date=2020-02-18|url-status=dead|date=September 10, 2019}}</ref>

===Risk analysis and management===
{{Expand section|date=December 2016}}
{{Further|Risk management}}
Foresight is a framework or lens which could be used in risk analysis and management in a medium- to long-term time range. A typical formal foresight project would identify key drivers and uncertainties relevant to the scope of analysis.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bishop|first1=Peter|title=Thinking about the Future: Guidelines for Strategic Foresight, 2nd Edition|publisher=Hinesight|location=Houston|isbn=978-099-677-3409|page=371|edition=2015|date=2015-10-10}}</ref> It would also analyze how the drivers and uncertainties could interact to create the most probable scenarios of interest and what risks they might contain. An additional step would be identifying actions to avoid or minimize these risks.

One classic example of such work was how foresight work at the Royal Dutch Shell international oil company led to envision the turbulent oil prices of the 1970s as a possibility and better embed this into company planning. Yet the practice at Shell focuses on stretching the company's thinking rather than in making predictions. Its planning is meant to link and embed scenarios in “organizational processes such as strategy making, innovation, risk management, public affairs, and leadership development.”<ref>{{cite magazine|last1=Kupers|first1=Roland|last2=Wilkinson|first2=Angela|title=Living in the Futures|url=https://hbr.org/2013/05/living-in-the-futures|publisher=Harvard Business Review|edition=May 2013}}</ref>

Foresight studies can also consider the possibility of “wild card” events – or events that many consider would be impossible to envision – although often such events can be imagined as remote possibilities as part of foresight work. One of many possible areas of focus for a foresight lens could also be identifying conditions for potential scenarios of high-level risks to society.

These risks may arise from the development and adoption of [[List of emerging technologies|emerging technologies]] and/or [[social change]]. Special interest lies on hypothetical future events that have the potential to damage human well-being on a global scale - [[global catastrophic risk]]s.<ref>{{cite book| author-link= Nick Bostrom| first= Nick| last= Bostrom| date= 2008| url= http://www.global-catastrophic-risks.com/docs/Chap01.pdf| title= Global Catastrophic Risks| publisher= Oxford University Press | page = 1}}</ref> Such events may cripple or destroy [[Modernity|modern civilization]] or, in the case of existential risks, even cause [[human extinction]].<ref name="types">{{cite journal| author-link=Nick Bostrom| first= Nick| last=Bostrom|date=March 2002| url= http://www.nickbostrom.com/existential/risks.html| title= Existential Risks: Analyzing Human Extinction Scenarios and Related Hazards| journal= [[Journal of Evolution and Technology]]| volume=9}}</ref> Potential global catastrophic risks include but are not limited to [[climate change]], [[AI takeover|hostile artificial intelligence]], [[Molecular nanotechnology#Risks|nanotechnology weapons]], [[Nuclear holocaust|nuclear warfare]], [[total war]], and [[pandemic]]s.

== Futurists ==
{{Main|Futurist}}
{{Tone|section|date=February 2019}}

Futurists are practitioners of the foresight profession, which seeks to provide organizations and individuals with images of the future to help them prepare for contingencies and to maximize opportunities. A foresight project begins with a question that ponders the future of any given subject area, including technology, medicine, government and business. Futurists engage in environmental scanning to search for drivers of change and emerging trends that may have an effect on the focus topic. The scanning process includes reviewing social media platforms, researching already prepared reports, engaging in Delphi studies, reading articles and any other sources of relevant information and preparing and analyzing data extrapolations. Then, through one of a number of highly structured methods<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hines |first1=Andy |title=Framework foresight for exploring emerging student needs |journal=On the Horizon |date=14 August 2017 |volume=25 |issue=3 |pages=145–156 |doi=10.1108/OTH-03-2017-0013}}</ref> futurists organize this information and use it to create multiple future scenarios for the topic, also known as a domain.
