Gucci was founded in 1921 by [[Guccio Gucci]] in [[Florence]], [[Tuscany]]. Under the direction of [[Aldo Gucci]] (son of Guccio), Gucci became a worldwide-known brand, an icon of the Italian ''Dolce Vita''. Following family feuds during the 1980s, the Gucci family was entirely ousted from the capital of the company by 1993. After this crisis, the brand was revived with a provocative 'Porno Chic' props. In 1999, Gucci was acquired by the French conglomerate [[Pinault Printemps Redoute]]. During the 2010s, Gucci became an iconic 'Geek-Chic' brand.

In 2019, Gucci operated 487 stores for 17,157 employees, and generated €9.628 billion in sales (€8.2 billion in 2018).<ref name=":6">{{Cite web|date=2018|title=Financial document 2018|url= https://keringcorporate.dam.kering.com/m/3ba17a6b64aae82d/original/2018-Financial-Document.pdf |access-date=2020-08-16|website=Kering}}</ref> [[Marco Bizzarri]] is CEO of Gucci since December 2014, and [[Alessandro Michele]] creative director since January 2015. Gucci is a subsidiary of the French luxury group [[Kering]].

==History==
=== 1921 birth in Florence ===
[[File:Guccio Gucci c.1940.JPG|thumb|The founder [[Guccio Gucci]].]]
{{See also|Guccio Gucci}}
The Gucci family claims its origins are rooted in the merchant city of [[Florence]] since around 1410. [[Guccio Gucci|Guccio Giovanbattista Giacinto Dario Maria Gucci]] (1881-1953) left Florence for [[Paris]], and settled in [[London]] in 1897 to work at the high-end [[Savoy Hotel]]. While working as a bellhop there, he would load/unload the luggage of the hotel's wealthy clients, learning about their tastes in fashion, quality, fabrics, traveling conditions... Then he worked 4 years for the [[Compagnie des Wagons-Lits]], the European rail company that specialized in upscale travel leisure, thus further enhancing his experience with luxurious traveling lifestyles. After WWI, he worked for the maker of fine luggage [[Franzi]].<ref name="Gucci 2016 p">{{harv|Gucci|2016|p=}}</ref><ref name="Forden 2001 p">{{harv|Forden|2001|p=}}</ref>

In 1921, Guccio Gucci bought his own shop on 7, Via della Vigna Nuova in Florence, ''Azienda Individuale Guccio Gucci'',<ref>{{Cite web|date=2018-01-24|title=GUCCI|url=https://moda.mam-e.it/dizionario-della-moda/gucci/|access-date=2020-09-22|website=Enciclopedia della moda Mame|language=it-IT}}</ref> where he sold imported leather luggage. He also opened a small workshop to have his own leather goods made by local craftsmen. Eventually, a larger workshop had to be acquired to house Gucci's 60 artisans. In 1935 the [[Second Italo-Ethiopian War|invasion of Ethiopia]] by Mussolini led the [[League of Nations]] to impose a trade embargo on Italy. Leather became scarce, pushing Guccio Gucci to introduce other fabrics in the composition of the products, such as raffia, wicker, wood, linen and, jute. The rombi motif, a Gucci signature, was created. The Gucci's developed a new tanning technique to produce "''cuoio grasso''", which became a Gucci trademark. In 1937, Gucci launched its handbags.<ref name="Forden 2001 p"/><ref name="Gucci 2016 p"/>

Guccio's wife and children all worked in the shop. [[Aldo Gucci|Aldo]], the son of Guccio, became increasingly involved in the family company since he started working there in 1925. He convinced his father to grow by opening a new shop in [[Rome]] (21 Via Condotti) in 1938, and launched more Gucci accessories (gloves, belts, wallets, keychains). During WWII, the artisans of Gucci worked on making boots for the Italian infantry.<ref name="Forden 2001 p"/><ref name="Gucci 2016 p"/>

The company made handbags of cotton [[canvas]] rather than leather during [[World War II]] as a result of material shortages. The canvas, however, was distinguished by a signature double-G symbol combined with prominent red and green bands. After the war, the Gucci crest, which showed a shield and armored knight surrounded by a ribbon inscribed with the family name, became synonymous with the city of Florence.

=== Post-war ''Dolce Vita'' ===

[[File:Gucci, bamboo bag, 1960-65 ca. (firenze, archivio storico gucci).jpg|thumb|Bamboo bag.]]
After the war, Guccio Gucci distributed the shares of the company to his three sons (Aldo, Vasco, Rodolfo). In 1947, Gucci launched the Bamboo bag.<ref>Date estimated by the fashion historian Aurora Fiorentini</ref> The brand launched its first global tagline, ''Quality is remembered long after price is forgotten''. The iconic [[moccasin]]s (Gucci [[loafer]]) were launched in 1952. Guccio Gucci died on 2 January 1953 in Milan. In November 1953, Gucci opened its first US store on [[Fifth Avenue|5th Avenue]] and [[58th Street (Manhattan)|58th Street]] in New York. A second NY shop opened in the Saint Regis Hotel in 1960, and a third on [[Fifth Avenue|5th Avenue]] and [[54th Street (Manhattan)|54th Street]] in 1973, leading the locals to call this NY area "Gucci City".<ref name="Gucci 2016 p"/>

In 1961, Gucci opened a store in [[London]] and [[Palm Beach, Florida|Palm Beach]], and launched the Jackie Bag. In March 1963, Gucci opened its first French store near [[Place Vendôme]] in [[Paris]].<ref name="Gucci 2016 p"/> The double-G logo for belt buckles and other accessory decorations was introduced in 1964.<ref name="Logo">{{cite web|title=Gucci Logo|url= http://www.famouslogos.net/gucci-logo/|url-status=live|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20121018004216/http://www.famouslogos.net/gucci-logo |archive-date=18 October 2012|access-date=20 March 2011|publisher=FamousLogos.net}}</ref> The Flora scarf was designed in 1966 by Rodolfo Gucci and Vittorio Accornero for [[Grace Kelly]] Princess of Monaco who became a notorious consumer of Gucci products. In October 1968, Gucci opened a store on 347 [[Rodeo Drive]], driving many Hollywood stars to endorse the brand. With the Rodeo Drive opening came the launch of Gucci's first dresses. Gucci's breakthrough in the USA led to its global development in Asia (Tokyo opening in 1972, Hong Kong in 1974) and the Middle East.<ref name="Gucci 2016 p" /> In Brussels, Aldo's son Roberto piloted the first Gucci franchised store. By 1969, Gucci managed 10 shops in the USA. 84,000 Gucci moccasins were sold in the USA alone that year. The US President [[John F. Kennedy]] called Aldo Gucci the "first Italian ambassador to the United States".<ref name="Forden 2001 p" />

Gucci launched a [[Rolls-Royce Motor Cars|Rolls-Royce]] luggage set in 1970<ref name="Gucci 2016 p" /> and partnered with [[American Motors|American Motors Corporation]] (AMC) to create the [[AMC Hornet#Gucci Sportabout|Gucci version of the AMC Hornet]] (1971, 1972, 1973). Gucci became one of the first American cars to offer a special luxury [[trim package]] created by a famous fashion designer.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Complete Encyclopedia of Motorcars 1885 to the present |publisher=Guild Publishing|year=1985|editor-last=Georgano|editor-first=G.N.|page=93}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Lund|first=Robert|date=October 1971|title=AMC gets it together|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=UtgDAAAAMBAJ&q=Gucci+sportabout&pg=PA206 |url-status=live|journal=Popular Mechanics |volume=136 |issue=4 |pages=116–118, 206 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170301110606/https://books.google.com/books?id=UtgDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA206&dq=Gucci+sportabout |archive-date=1 March 2017|access-date=28 June 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Dunnaway |first=Jen|date=10 April 2009|title=Hot: Gucci-Edition Hornet Interior! |url= http://blog.cardomain.com/2009/04/10/hot-gucci-edition-hornet-interior/ |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140313022445/http://blog.cardomain.com/2009/04/10/hot-gucci-edition-hornet-interior |archive-date=13 March 2014 |access-date=28 June 2017|publisher=cardomain.com}}</ref> Gucci launched Gucci Perfumes (Il Mio Profumo) and its first watch (Model 2000) in 1972, its first franchised store in the US in 1973, and opened the Gucci Galleria in its Beverly Hills store in 1977, a private art gallery adjoined to the store and reserved to premium clients who were given a golden key to access it.<ref name="Gucci 2016 p" /><ref name="Forden 2001 p" /> From 1978 to 1984 a [[Miami]]-based [[coachbuilder]] marketed a Gucci edition of the [[Cadillac Seville]] sedan (the 1978 model is exhibited at the Gucci Museum).<ref name="Alook">{{cite web|author=Sean|date=24 April 2012|title=A look at 40 years of Gucci edition cars from American Motors to Cadillac to Fiat|url= http://www.classiccarstodayonline.com/2012/04/24/40-years-of-gucci-edition-cars-spanning-american-motors-to-cadillac-now-fiat/ |url-status=dead|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170413183006/http://www.classiccarstodayonline.com/2012/04/24/40-years-of-gucci-edition-cars-spanning-american-motors-to-cadillac-now-fiat |archive-date=13 April 2017|access-date=28 June 2017|work=Classic Cars Today Online}}</ref>

=== 1980s Gucci’s family feud ===
{{See also|Maurizio Gucci}}
In 1969, Giorgio, the son of Aldo, had sparked the first  family feud by launching ''Gucci Boutique'' on his own, which was finally reabsorbed by the family group in 1972.<ref name="Forden 2001 p"/> During the 1980s, the Gucci saga eroded the family-held top management of the company and fed the press headlines. Paolo Gucci, son of Aldo, tried to launch  the brand ''Gucci Plus'' on his own. Aldo was criticized for developing most of the international business under Gucci America which he owned. In 1982, to ease tensions in the family, the Gucci group was consolidated and became a publicly-traded company, Guccio Gucci SpA.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2009-06-17|title=Guccio Gucci|url=https://www.theflorentine.net/2009/06/18/guccio-gucci/|access-date=2020-09-18|website=The Florentine|language=en-US}}</ref><ref name="Gucci 2016 p"/> In May 1983, Rodolfo died. His son [[Maurizio Gucci]] inherited his father's majority stake in the company and launched a legal war against his uncle Aldo for full control of Gucci (a prosecution led by the city prosecutor [[Rudy Giuliani|Rudolph Giuliani]], and with [[Domenico De Sole|Domenico de Sole]] representing the Gucci family).<ref name="Gucci 2016 p"/> [[Maurizio Gucci]] took over the company's direction. In 1986, Aldo Gucci, 81, with only 16,7% of Gucci left in his possession, was sentenced to a year in prison for [[tax evasion]]<ref>{{Cite news|last=Lubasch|first=Arnold H.|date=1986-09-12|title=Gucci, 81, Gets Year in Prison in Federal Tax Case|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url= https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/12/nyregion/gucci-81-gets-year-in-prison-in-federal-tax-case.html|access-date=2020-08-16|issn=0362-4331}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Gucci Fashionable in Prison |url= https://www.upi.com/Archives/1987/04/01/GUCCI-FASHIONABLE-IN-PRISON/3772544251600/ |access-date=2020-08-16 |website=UPI|language=en}}</ref> (in a prison where [[Albert Nipon]] was also an inmate<ref name="Gucci 2016 p" />). The artwork of the Gucci Galleria was liquidated.<ref name="Gucci 2016 p" /> In 1988, Maurizio Gucci sold almost 47.8% of Gucci to the [[Bahrain]]-based investment fund [[Investcorp]] (owner of [[Tiffany & Co.|Tiffany]] since 1984), and withheld the other 50%.<ref>{{cite web|date=1988-06-07|title=Investcorp Buys Half of Gucci |url= https://www.joc.com/investcorp-buys-half-gucci_19880607.html |access-date=2020-08-16|website=www.joc.com}}</ref>

From 1991 to 1993, Gucci's finances were still in the red, Maurizio Gucci was blamed for spending extravagant amounts of money on the company's headquarters in Florence (Via delle Caldaie palazzo) and in Milan. Investcorp bought the remaining 50% of Guccio Gucci S.p.A. from Maurizio Gucci in 1993, ending the family involvement in the group.<ref name=":3" /> In March 1995, Maurizio Gucci was shot dead in the lobby of Gucci's Milan office.<ref>{{cite web|date=1995-03-28|title=Gucci heir shot dead at Milan office|url= http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/gucci-heir-shot-dead-at-milan-office-1613072.html |access-date=2020-08-16|website=The Independent|language=en}}</ref> His ex-wife [[Patrizia Reggiani]] served 16 years in jail for hiring the hitman of the murder.<ref>{{cite web|title=Gucci Ex-Wife Guilty Of Murder|url= https://www.cbsnews.com/news/gucci-ex-wife-guilty-of-murder/ |access-date=2020-08-16 |website=www.cbsnews.com|language=en-US}}</ref>

==Counterfeiting==
During the 1970s, the explosive popularity of Gucci turned the brand into a prime target of the counterfeiting industry.<ref name="Gucci 2016 p" /> The Gucci workshops elaborated the brindle pigskin tanning technique that became a Gucci signature, and a tanning process difficult to counterfeit. In 1977 alone, Gucci launched 34 lawsuits for counterfeiting.<ref name="Forden 2001 p" /> By the mid-1980s, the brand was involved in « thousands of confiscations and lawsuits all over the world ».<ref>Jane Anderson, [https://www.csmonitor.com/1984/0612/061208.html Gucci company thrives as a family affair], ''Csmonitor.com'', 12 June 1984</ref>

On 5 November 2013, the UK's Intellectual Property Office issued a ruling that Gucci had lost the rights to its GG trademark in the UK "to a version of the GG logo in four categories, which encompassed garments such as bracelets, shoulder bags, scarves and coats".<ref name="Gucci in Trademark Tussle in U.K.">{{cite web|last=Jones|first=Nina|date=20 November 2013|title=Gucci in Trademark Tussle in U.K.|url=http://www.wwd.com/fashion-news/fashion-scoops/trademark-tussle-7283696?src=nl/mornReport/20131120|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150108235820/http://www.wwd.com/fashion-news/fashion-scoops/trademark-tussle-7283696?src=nl%2FmornReport%2F20131120|archive-date=8 January 2015|access-date=3 December 2015|publisher=WWD}}</ref> However, "according to Gucci, the ruling does not affect the use of its GG logo in the region" because "Gucci is the owner of several other valid registrations for this mark, including a Community Trade Mark (covering the European Union) for its iconic GG logo and those rights are directly enforceable in the U.K."<ref name="Gucci in Trademark Tussle in U.K." />
