During various periods in [[History of the United States|United States history]], people of color included [[African Americans]], [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Latino Americans]], [[Asian Americans]], [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], [[Pacific Islander Americans]], [[Middle Eastern Americans]], and [[multiracial Americans]].

==History==
The ''American Heritage Guide to Contemporary Usage and Style'' cites usage of "people of colour" as far back as 1796. It was initially used to refer to light-skinned people of mixed African and European heritage.<ref name=houghton356/> French [[Colonialism|colonists]] used the term ''[[gens de couleur]]'' ("people of color") to refer to people of mixed African and European descent who were freed from [[slavery]] in the Americas.<ref>{{cite book|last=Brickhouse|first=Anna|page=91|year=2009|title=Transamerican Literary Relations and the Nineteenth-Century Public Sphere|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0521101011}}</ref> In South Carolina and other parts of the [[Deep South]], this term was used to distinguish between slaves who were mostly "[[Black people|black]]" or "[[negro]]" and free people who were primarily "[[mulatto]]" or "[[mixed race]]".<ref>Powers, Bernard. ''Black Charlestonians: a Social History 1822-1885.'' University of Arkansas Press, 1994</ref> After the [[American Civil War]], "colored" was used as a label exclusively for black Americans, but the term eventually fell out of favor by the mid-20th century.<ref name=houghton356/>

Although American activist [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] used the term "citizens of color" in 1963, the phrase in its current meaning did not catch on until the late 1970s.<ref name=safire>{{cite web|author-link=William Safire|author=William Safire|title=On language: People of color|work= [[The New York Times]]|date=November 20, 1988|accessdate=2008-03-21|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE2DD153CF933A15752C1A96E948260&sec=&spon=}}</ref><ref>"The Black Press at 150", editorial, ''[[The Washington Post]]'', March 18, 1977</ref> In the late 20th century, the term "person of color" was introduced in the United States in order to counter the condescension implied by the terms "non-white" and "[[minority group|minority]]",<ref>{{cite book|title=Teacher's Guide for in the Shadow of Race: Growing Up As a Multiethnic, Multicultural, and "Multiracial" American|publisher=Routledge|author=Christine Clark, Teja Arboleda|page=17|date=1999|quote=The term People of Color emerged in reaction to the terms "non-white" and "minority." … The term people of color attempts to counter the condescension implied in the other two." }}</ref> and [[racial justice]] activists in the U.S., influenced by radical theorists such as [[Frantz Fanon]], popularized it at this time.<ref name=immigrants/> By the late 1980s and early 1990s, it was in wide circulation.<ref name=immigrants>{{cite web|url= http://www.colorlines.com/article.php?ID=227|author= Rinku Sen|title= Are Immigrants and Refugees People of Color?|publisher= [[ColorLines Magazine|ColorLines]]|date= 2007-07-10|accessdate= 2008-12-08|author-link= Rinku Sen|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100418095230/http://www.colorlines.com/article.php?ID=227|archive-date= 2010-04-18|url-status= dead}}</ref> Both anti-racist activists and academics sought to move the understanding of race beyond the black-white dichotomy then prevalent.<ref>{{cite web

The phrase "women of color" was developed and introduced for wide use by a group of black women activists at the [[National Women's Conference]] in 1977.<ref name="socimages-woc">{{cite web |last1=Wade |first1=Lisa |title=Loretta Ross on the Phrase "Women of Color" |url=https://thesocietypages.org/socimages/2011/03/26/loreta-ross-on-the-phrase-women-of-color/ |website=Sociological Images |accessdate=9 October 2018}}</ref> The phrase was used as a method of communicating solidarity between non-white women that was, according to [[Loretta Ross]], not based on "biological destiny" but instead a political act of naming themselves.<ref name="socimages-woc" />

In the [[twenty-first century]] use of the term and the "of color" categorization continued to proliferate: for example, the Joint Council of Librarians of Color (JCLC), a recurring conference of the [[American Library Association]], formed from the organization's five ethnic affiliate associations: the [[Black Caucus of the American Library Association]], the [[American Indian Library Association]], the [[Asian Pacific American Librarians Association]], the [[Chinese American Librarians Association]], and [[REFORMA|REFORMA: The National Association to Promote Library & Information Services to Latinos and the Spanish Speaking]].<ref name="ALM20180102"/>

===BIPOC===
The acronym BIPOC, referring to "black, indigenous, and people of color", first appeared around 2013.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Garcia |first1=Sandra E. |title=Where Did BIPOC Come From? |url=https://www.nytimes.com/article/what-is-bipoc.html |accessdate=September 8, 2020 |work=New York Times |date=June 17, 2020}}</ref> By June 2020, it had become more prevalent on the internet,<ref name="nyt-bipoc-garcia">{{cite web |last1=Garcia |first1=Sandra E. |title=Where Did BIPOC Come From? |url=https://www.nytimes.com/article/what-is-bipoc.html |work=The New York Times |accessdate=16 June 2020 |date=June 16, 2020}}</ref> as racial justice awareness grew in the US in the wake of the [[killing of George Floyd]].

==Political significance==
According to Stephen Satris of [[Clemson University]], in the United States there are two main [[racial segregation in the United States|racial divides]]. The first is the "black–white" delineation; the second racial delineation is the one "between whites and everyone else" with whites being "narrowly construed" and everyone else being called "people of color".<ref name=Zack>{{cite book|editor-last=Zack|editor-first=Naomi|title=American Mixed Race: The Culture of Microdiversity|last=Satris|first=Stephen|chapter='What Are They?' |date=1995|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|isbn=978-0847680139 |pages=55–56 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G9vLpONQLXMC&pg=PA55 |accessdate=17 June 2020}}</ref> Because the term "people of color" includes vastly different people with only the common distinction of not being white, it draws attention to the perceived fundamental role of [[racialization]] in the United States. Joseph Tuman of [[San Francisco State University]] argues that the term "people of color" is attractive because it unites disparate racial and ethnic groups into a larger collective in [[solidarity]] with one another.<ref>{{cite book|last= Tuman|first=Joseph S.|title=Communicating terror|publisher=SAGE |date=2003|isbn=978-0-7619-2765-5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2Rt_DOyCumAC&q=definition+%22person+of+color%22&pg=PA36}}</ref>

Use of the term "person of color", especially in the United States, is often associated with the [[social justice]] movement.<ref name="AdamsBell1997">{{cite book|author1=Maurianne Adams|author2=Lee Anne Bell|author3=Pat Griffin|title=Teaching for Diversity and Social Justice: A Sourcebook|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V-BEnvaodCoC&pg=PA98|year=1997|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-415-91057-6|page=98}}</ref> [[Style guide]]s from the American Heritage Guide to Contemporary Usage and Style,<ref>Houghton Mifflin Company, p. 319</ref> the [[Stanford Graduate School of Business]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Stanford Graduate School of Business Writing and Editing Style Guide|url=http://www.gsb.stanford.edu/styleguide/pdf/print_styleguide.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120915153112/http://www.gsb.stanford.edu/styleguide/pdf/print_styleguide.pdf|archivedate=15 September 2012|accessdate=18 September 2010}}</ref> and [[Mount Holyoke College]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Editorial Style Guide|url=http://www.mtholyoke.edu/communications/editorial.html#P|accessdate=18 September 2010|author=Mount Holyoke College}}</ref> all recommend the term "person of color" over other alternatives. Unlike "colored", which historically referred primarily to black people and is often considered [[wikt:offensive#English|offensive]], "person of color" and its variants refer inclusively to all non-European peoples—often with the notion that there is political solidarity among them—and, according to one style guide, "are virtually always considered terms of pride and respect."<ref name=houghton356/>

==Criticism==
Many critics, both whites and non-whites, of the term object to its lack of specificity and find the phrase racially offensive.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/phrase-people-person-of-colour-bme-black-woman-women-different-experiences-race-racism-a7868586.html|title=I am no 'person of colour', I am a black African woman|author= Adebola Lamuye|date=31 July 2017|publisher=The Independent|accessdate=2018-01-23}}</ref><ref>https://thedailyaztec.com/100319/opinion/opinion-the-term-people-of-color-fails-to-be-properly-inclusive-of-the-black-community/</ref> <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ottawacitizen.com/opinion/adam-why-the-term-people-of-colour-is-offensive-to-so-many|title=Adam: Why the term 'people of colour' is offensive to so many|website=ottawacitizen}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gq.com/story/author-damon-young-on-bipoc-phrasing|title=The Phrase “People of Color” Needs to Die|first=Damon|last=Young|website=GQ}}</ref> It has been argued that the term lessens the focus on individual issues facing different racial and ethnic groups.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/black-women-people-of-colour-racism-beyonce-coachella-black-lives-matter-a8316561.html|title=As a black woman, I hate the term 'people of colour'|date=2018-04-22}}</ref> Preserving "whiteness" as an in-tact category while lumping every other racial group into an indiscriminate category ("of color") can replicate the very marginalization the term was intended to counter.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/opinion/readersreact/la-ol-le-people-of-color-white-people-privilege-20190504-story.html|title=Readers React: The problem with ‘people of color’: It implies whiteness is the default|date=May 4, 2019|website=Los Angeles Times}}</ref>

=== U.S. Concept of Whiteness and Spanish Language Speakers ===
{{main|White Hispanic and Latino Americans}}

The term has come under fire as an inaccurate modifier for "[[White Hispanic and Latino Americans]]" and [[Spaniards]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2020/02/09/803809670/why-labeling-antonio-banderas-a-person-of-color-triggers-such-a-backlash|title=Why Labeling Antonio Banderas A 'Person Of Color' Triggers Such A Backlash|author= Lucía Benavides|date=9 February 2020|publisher=NPR|accessdate=2020-04-24}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://english.elpais.com/elpais/2020/01/16/inenglish/1579172122_964523.html|title=Is Spain’s Antonio Banderas an ‘actor of color’?|first=Antonia|last=Laborde|date=January 17, 2020|website=EL PAÍS}}</ref> The term incorrectly racializes this segment of the [[Hispanic]] demographic, projecting "coloredness" (or non-Europeanness) onto people who are, in fact, of European extraction. This is particularly (although not exclusively) true in the case of Spaniards and Latino Americans from South American countries with large proportions of "[[White Latin Americans]]". While many Latinos are indeed "people of color," many are not, as "latino" is an ethnicity rather than a racial category.<ref>https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/fedreg/1997standards.html</ref> In the U.S. context, the 
Latino group with the highest proportion of self-identifying whites are [[Cuban-Americans]], with 85.4% identifying as white.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/briefs/c2010br-04.pdf |title=The Hispanic Population: 2010 |accessdate=2011-07-11 |author1=Sharon R. Ennis |author2=Merarys Ríos-Vargas |author3=Nora G. Albert |date=May 2011 |publisher=U.S. Census Bureau |page=14 (Table 6)}}</ref> While the indiscriminate labeling of all latinos as "people of color" underscores common struggles in a racialized society, it obscures the vast racial inequalities that exist within the latino population itself; for this reason, many have found the term unhelpful and misleading. The racialization of latinos in the U.S. has created a situation in which it is possible, in certain contexts, to be both (racially) "white" and (socially) "a person of color"—an intermediary predicament akin to that which [[Irish Americans]] and [[Italian Americans]], among others, found themselves in the mid-19th and early 20th centuries respectively.
