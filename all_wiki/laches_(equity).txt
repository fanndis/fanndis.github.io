'''Laches''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|æ|tʃ|ɪ|z}} "latches", {{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|eɪ|tʃ|ɪ|z}}};  [[Law French]]: ''remissness'', ''dilatoriness'', from Old French ''laschesse'') refers to a lack of diligence and activity in making a legal claim, or moving forward with legal enforcement of a right, particularly in regard to [[equity (law)|equity]]; hence, it is an ''unreasonable'' delay that can be viewed as prejudicing the opposing [defending] party. When asserted in litigation, it is an [[Equity (law)|equity]] defense, that is, a defense to a claim for an equitable remedy. The person invoking laches is asserting that an opposing party has "slept on its rights", and that, as a result of this delay, circumstances have changed, witnesses or evidence may have been lost or no longer available, etc., such that it is no longer a just resolution to grant the [[plaintiff]]'s claim. Laches is associated with the maxim of equity, "Equity aids the vigilant, not the sleeping ones" who sleep on their rights. Put another way, failure to assert one's rights in a timely manner can result in a claim being barred by laches.

==Origin, definition, overview==
{{refimprove section|date=January 2016}}
Laches is a legal term derived from the [[Old French]] ''laschesse,'' meaning "remissness" or "dilatoriness," and is viewed as the opposite of "vigilance."<ref name="bld">{{cite book| chapter = Laches [Definition of 'laches' by Black's]  | title=Black's Law Dictionary | publisher = West  | year=2009 | edition=9th | editor-last=Garner|editor-first=Bryan A. | isbn=978-0314199492 | url = https://archive.org/details/blacksl_xxx_2009_00_5869 | url-access = registration  | accessdate=5 January 2016}}</ref><ref>{{OED|Laches [Definition of 'laches' by OED]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/laches|title=Laches [Definition of 'laches' by Merriam-Webster]|author=|date=|work=merriam-webster.com|accessdate=5 January 2016}}</ref> The United States Supreme Court case ''Costello v.

# a delay in bringing the action,
# a delay that is unreasonable and
# that prejudices the defendant.

===Delay===
The period of delay begins when the plaintiff knew, or reasonably ought to have known, that the cause of action existed; the period of delay ends only when the legal action is formally filed.<ref>http://www.modeljuryinstructions.com/tag/laches/</ref> Informing or warning the defendant of the cause of action (for example by sending a cease-and-desist letter or merely ''threatening'' a lawsuit) does ''not'', by itself, end the period of delay.<ref name="danjaq"/>{{primary source inline|date=January 2016}}

===Unreasonableness===
To invoke laches the delay by the opposing party in initiating the lawsuit must be unreasonable.  The courts have recognized the following causes of delay as reasonable:{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}
* the exhaustion of remedies through the administrative process
* the evaluation and preparation of a complicated claim
* to determine whether the scope of proposed infringement will justify the cost of litigation<ref name="danjaq"/>{{primary source inline|date=January 2016}}

By contrast, it is ''not'' reasonable to delay a lawsuit to "capitalize on the value of the infringer's labor".  In ''Danjaq v. Sony'', the Ninth Circuit decided that a screenwriter who waited for a film studio to publicize and distribute a film based on a script he allegedly owned had delayed his lawsuit unreasonably.<ref name="danjaq"/>{{primary source inline|date=January 2016}}

===Prejudice===
Unreasonable delay must prejudice the defendant.  Examples of such prejudice include:{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}
* evidence favorable to the defendant becoming lost or degraded
* witnesses favorable to the defendant dying or losing their memories
* the defendant making economic decisions (e.g. investing in a movie or a manufacturing process) that it would not have done, had the lawsuit been filed earlier.<ref name="danjaq"/>

Unreasonable delay may also prejudice the rights of third-parties who were unknown in the case, earlier but whose rights got created in the intervening period of the delay (e.g.: the defendant inducts new persons on a disputed property by sale, or by lease)

==Procedure==
{{primary sources|section|date=January 2016}}
A defense lawyer raising the defense of ''laches'' against a motion for [[Injunction|injunctive relief]] (a form of equitable relief) might argue that the plaintiff comes "waltzing in at the eleventh hour" when it is now too late to grant the relief sought, at least not without causing great harm that the plaintiff could have avoided. In certain types of cases (for example, cases involving time-sensitive matters, such as elections), a delay of even a few days is likely to be met with a defense of ''laches'', even where the applicable [[statute of limitations]] might allow the type of action to be commenced within a much longer time period. In courts in the United States, laches has often been applied even where a statute of limitations exists, although there is a division of authority on this point.<ref name="Little Bit of Laches" />

If a court does accept the laches defense, it can decide either to deny the request for equitable relief or to narrow the equitable relief that it would otherwise give. Even if the court denies equitable relief to a plaintiff because of laches, the plaintiff may still have a claim for legal relief if the statute of limitations has not run out.

Under the United States [[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure]], ''laches'' is an [[affirmative defense]], which means that the burden of asserting ''laches'' is on the party responding to the claim to which it applies.{{quote|"When the defense of laches is clear on the face of the complaint, and where it is clear that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts to avoid the insuperable bar, a court may consider the defense on a motion to dismiss."<ref>Solow v. Nine West Group, 2001 WL 736794, *3 (S.D.N.Y. June 29, 2001).{{primary source inline|date=January 2016}}</ref>{{primary source inline|date=January 2016}} <ref>Simons v. United States, 452 F.2d 1110, 1116 (2d Cir. 1971) (affirming Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal based, in part, on laches where papers "reveal no reason for the inordinate and prejudicial delay").{{primary source inline|date=January 2016}}</ref>{{primary source inline|date=January 2016}} }}

The ''laches'' defense does not apply if the claimant was a [[Minor (law)|minor]] during the time that the claim was not brought, so a party can bring a claim against an historical injustice when they reach their majority.<ref name=MajorityDefense>{{cite web|url=http://ttabvue.uspto.gov/ttabvue/v?pno=92046185&pty=CAN&eno=199|title=USPTO Trademark Trial and Appeal Board, Amanda Blackhorse, Marcus Briggs-Cloud, Philip Gover, Jillian Pappan, and Courtney Tsotigh v.

==Compared to statute of limitations==
The defense of ''laches'' resembles a [[statute of limitations]] since both are concerned with ensuring that plaintiffs bring their claims in a timely fashion.

However,  a statute of limitations is concerned only with the time that has passed. Laches is concerned with the reasonableness of the delay in a particular situation and so is more case-specific and more focused on the equitable conduct of the plaintiff. Those considerations are not unique to the laches defense because they are characteristic of equitable reasoning and equitable remedies.<ref name="Little Bit of Laches" /> Whereas, limitation is a statutory remedy.

In the US, the proper disposal of claims in light of those two areas of law has required attention through to the Supreme Court. In ''[[Petrella v. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]'' (2014), the [[US Supreme Court]] rebuffed a defendant's claim that laches barred a copyright infringement suit because Congress had established a detailed statutory scheme, including a statute of limitations.<ref name=Fisher>{{cite journal | author = Fisher, Daniel | url = https://www.forbes.com/sites/danielfisher/2014/05/19/unusual-split-as-supreme-court-upholds-raging-bull-suit-vs-mgm/ | date = 2014  | title = Supreme Court Upholds 'Raging Bull' Suit vs. MGM | journal = [[Forbes (magazine)|Forbes]] | format = online | issue = May 19, 2014 | access-date = 5 January 2016}}</ref>

In [[Grand Haven, Michigan]], the Northwest Ottawa Community Health System sued [[Grand Haven Charter Township, Michigan|Grand Haven Township]] and Health Pointe, which was in the process of building a competing medical facility in the township, arguing that the township ignored its own zoning ordinance in approving the project. On March 24, 2017, as part of the ruling dismissing the lawsuit, Circuit Court Judge Jon A. Van Allsburg noted that the Northwest Ottawa Community Health System delayed more than eight months from the date the project was approved before filing the lawsuit and that during that time, plaintiff Health Pointe had purchased construction materials. Therefore, the doctrine of laches invalidated a lawsuit that was filed so long after the fact.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Kloosterman|first1=Stephen|title=Judge dismisses hospital lawsuit against township, Spectrum project|url=http://www.mlive.com/news/muskegon/index.ssf/2017/03/judge_dismisses_hospitals_laws.html|accessdate=30 March 2017|work=MLive|publisher=MLive Media Group|date=March 29, 2017}}</ref>
