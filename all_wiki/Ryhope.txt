'''Ryhope''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|r|aɪ|.|ə|p}} {{respell|RY|əp}}) is a coastal village along the southern boundary of the [[City of Sunderland]], in [[Tyne and Wear]], [[North East England]]. With a population of approximately 14,000, measured at 10.484 in the [[United Kingdom Census 2011|2011 census]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/dissemination/LeadKeyFigures.do?a=7&b=13689669&c=SR2+9NA&d=14&e=62&g=6360516&i=1001x1003x1032x1004&m=0&r=0&s=1437558408371&enc=1|title=Sunderland ward population 2011|accessdate=22 July 2015}}</ref> Ryhope is 2.9 miles to the centre of [[Sunderland, Tyne and Wear|Sunderland]], 2.8 miles to the centre of [[Seaham]], and 1.2 miles from the main [[A19 road|A19]].

The older village section is centred on a triangular 'green', which contains a war monument. The newer 'Colliery' area of Ryhope flanks the Ryhope Street/Tunstall Bank road, which lead toward the Tunstall and Silksworth areas of Sunderland.

==Geography and administration==
[[File:Ryhope.JPG|thumb|left|200px|Ryhope Village Green]]

The [[A1018 road|A1018]] 'Southern Radial Route', which opened in 2008, bypasses Ryhope along the clifftops and takes traffic toward the Port of Sunderland in [[Hendon, Sunderland|Hendon]] and other routes to the centre and north of Sunderland.

The B1287 Sea View Road links Ryhope with the town of [[Seaham]] to the south.

Ryhope is surrounded by farmland meaning it is a relatively isolated suburb of Sunderland. A number of cycle routes run through the village, including the [[National Cycle Network]] Route number 1 which is looked after by a local team of Sustrans Rangers.

Located to the south-west of the village is [[Cherry Knowle Hospital]] which is part of the South of Tyne and Wearside Mental Health NHS Trust. It has long been the main mental health services complex for the Wearside area. The Ryhope Engines Museum is also located in this area.

Ryhope has long formed part of the [[Houghton and Washington East (UK Parliament constituency)]], but following boundary changes it will be moved to [[Sunderland Central]] for the next general election.

==History==
Ryhope (from the Old English ''reof hoppas'', meaning "rough valley"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.n-a-g.freeserve.co.uk/DOCUMENTS/ISS22_7May2002/ISS22_7May2002.htm|title=Recognition of ancient names|accessdate=2006-11-23|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060925022415/http://www.n-a-g.freeserve.co.uk/DOCUMENTS/ISS22_7May2002/ISS22_7May2002.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive -->|archivedate=2006-09-25}}</ref>) is first mentioned in 930&nbsp;AD when king [[Athelstan]] granted the land of Bishopwearmouth (including the township of Ryhope) to the Bishop of [[Chester-le-Street]]. The land had been reclaimed from the [[Vikings]] who had captured it in 918&nbsp;AD.

Ryhope has a strong history of [[farming]]; in 1183 there were 22 recorded [[villein]]s who provided the landowner with cattle and crops. In 1380 the population had swelled to approximately 150. In 1860 common grazing land was split into plots, which radiated out in strips from the village green. Ryhope's proximity to the sea has allowed it to serve as a seaside destination for centuries. The beach is said{{By whom|date=December 2015}} to have been a favourite sea-bathing spot for the [[Bishop of Durham]].

Located on the [[Durham, England|Durham]] coalfield, Ryhope followed the path of many other villages in the area, and abandoned agriculture as the main employer in favour of [[coal]]. In 1859 a [[colliery]] was opened, causing huge changes in the geography of the village. The settlement of Ryhope extended west toward the area of [[Tunstall, Sunderland|Tunstall]], creating two distinct areas of Ryhope; the 'Village' and the 'Colliery' (the post-World War II, council-built estate of 'Hollycarrside' forms a third section.) [[Railway]] lines were introduced to the area, linking Ryhope to Sunderland, [[Seaham]] and other Durham Coalfield mining villages. Now only a single railway line runs through the village, and there is no longer [[Ryhope East railway station|a station]]. The colliery was closed in 1966.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://twsitelines.info/SMR/6994|title=Ryhope Colliery &#124; sitelines.newcastle.gov.uk|publisher=Twsitelines.info|date=|accessdate=2019-04-11}}</ref>

==World War II==
In March 1944 Ryhope was the scene of the conclusion of the epic last flight of the [[Handley Page Halifax]] bomber LK797 from [[RAF Bomber Command]]'s raid on [[Nuremberg]], which crash-landed in Ryhope, resulting in Pilot Officer [[Cyril Barton]] being posthumously awarded the [[Victoria Cross]].

==Notable people==
Notable "Ryhopeans" include:
* Former [[Sunderland AFC]] Manager [[Mick Buxton]]
* Actor [[Ronald Radd]]
* Former bare buckle boxer , [[Sunderland AFC]] Player [[Jake Pattison]]

==Tourism==
[[Ryhope Engines Museum]], which is based on the Ryhope [[Pumping Station]], was built in 1868 to supply water to the Sunderland area.

Among natural features, Ryhope adjoins [[Tunstall Hills]] which have views of the city of Sunderland and beyond (on a clear day, down the coast almost to [[Whitby]]). The Tunstall Hills are located on the southern outskirts of Sunderland between (New) [[Silksworth]] and Ryhope. The disused quarries and cuttings at Tunstall Hills provide exposure through part of the Magnesian Limestone succession of [[Permian]] age. The slopes on the "Maiden Paps" section support species such as blue moor-grass, common rock-rose, perennial flax and locally uncommon plants such as [[Frog Orchid]], Autumn Gentian and Purple Milk-Vetch. These areas have been designated a "site of special scientific interest" (SSSI).

Ryhope is also home to the world's first (and so far only) listed Pigeon Cree.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sunderlandecho.com/news/the-region-s-weirdest-tourist-attraction-1-1136518 |title=The region's weirdest tourist attraction? |publisher=Sunderland Echo |date=2007-08-23 |accessdate=2019-04-11}}</ref>
