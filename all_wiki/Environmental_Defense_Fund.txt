'''Environmental Defense Fund''' or '''EDF''' (formerly known as '''Environmental Defense''') is a United States-based [[nonprofit]] [[environmental organization|environmental advocacy group]]. The group is known for its work on issues including [[global warming]], [[ecosystem restoration]], oceans, and human health, and advocates using sound [[science]], [[economics]] and [[law]] to find environmental solutions that work. It is nonpartisan, and its work often advocates [[Market (economics)|market]]-based solutions to environmental problems.

The group's headquarters are in [[New York City]], with offices across the US, with scientists and policy specialists working worldwide. Regional offices more focused on local issues and policies include [[Austin, Texas]]; [[Boston]]; [[Boulder, Colorado]]; [[Los Angeles]]; [[Raleigh, North Carolina]]; [[Sacramento, California]]; [[San Francisco]]; [[Washington, D.C.]]

[[Fred Krupp]] has served as its president since 1984.<ref>[[Hoover's Company In-Depth Records|Hoover's Company Records – Basic and In-depth Records]]: Hoover ID: 130102.

Their research uncovered a link between the spraying of [[DDT]] to kill [[mosquito]]s and thinning egg shells of large birds. Their research was most likely based on the book ''[[Silent Spring]]'' by [[Rachel Carson]] about the dangers of DDT and the effects that it had on birds, published in 1962.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}} Carson, who died in 1964, is noted as the scientist who inspired the environmental movement.

In looking back at passage of the Safe Drinking Water Act of 1974, top EPA officials responsible for implementing the law recall that EDF published a statistical study that supported a link between organic contaminants and cancer rates in the City of New Orleans, a study that received a tremendous amount of media attention and certainly contributed to the enactment of the law.<ref>EPA Alumni Association: Senior EPA officials discuss early implementation of the Safe Drinking Water Act of 1974, [http://www.epaalumni.org/history/video/interview.cfm?id=13 Video], [http://www.epaalumni.org/userdata/pdf/6014106B36AE81EB.pdf#page=3 Transcript] (see p4).</ref>

On April 11, 2018, the group announced plans for MethaneSAT, a satellite to help identify global methane emissions, concentrating on the 50 major oil and gas regions responsible for 80% of methane production. Plans are for the satellite to launch in late 2020 or early 2021 and EDF says it will make the data public.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://spacenews.com/environmental-group-plans-satellite-to-track-greenhouse-gas-emissions/|title=Environmental group plans satellite to track greenhouse gas emissions - SpaceNews.com|last=Foust|first=Jeff|date=2018-04-13|work=SpaceNews.com|access-date=2018-10-28|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.edf.org/climate/how-methanesat-is-different|title=How MethaneSAT is different from other satellites|work=Environmental Defense Fund|access-date=2018-10-28|language=en}}</ref> The goal is to help reduce methane emissions by 45% by 2025.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ted.com/talks/fred_krupp_what_if_we_tracked_methane_from_space_and_hit_the_brakes_on_climate_change/transcript|title=Transcript of "Let's launch a satellite to track a threatening greenhouse gas"|last=Krupp|first=Fred|language=en|access-date=2018-10-28}}</ref> Funding for the project comes from The Audacious Project, an initiative of the worldwide [[TED (conference)|TED conference]] group.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/ted-oil-industry-methane-pollution-tracked-by-new-satellite-2018-4|title=Oil and gas operations release a powerful pollutant that threatens humanity — and a new satellite will have unprecedented abilities to track it|last=Schwartz|first=Ariel|date=2018-04-12|work=Business Insider|access-date=2018-10-28}}</ref> While MethaneSAT will offer a big-picture view, a complementary satellite by the [[California Air Resources Board]] will help identify point-source greenhouse gas emissions.

==Criticism==
EDF has drawn criticism for its ties to large corporations including [[McDonald's]], [[FedEx]], [[Walmart]],<ref>{{cite web|title=CorpWatch: Greenwashing Walmart|url=http://www.corpwatch.org/article.php?id=15707}}</ref> and the Texas energy company [[TXU Energy|TXU]], with which the organization has negotiated to reduce emissions and develop more environmentally friendly business practices. EDF's philosophy is that it is willing to talk with big business and try new approaches in order to get environmental results.<ref>

===Fisheries conservation===
A 2009 op-ed piece by the Pacific Coast Federation of Fisherman's Association in the trade journal ''Fishermen's News'' argues that EDF's approach to fisheries policy in the Pacific Northwest is likely to damage smaller, local operators who have an interest in protecting [[fishery|fisheries]] and limiting [[by-catch]]. Many fishermen fear that the approach gives a competitive advantage to larger, non-local operations, jeopardizing independent operators, including boats, fisheries, and ports.<ref>

EDF argues that the way we manage our fisheries needs to change if we want to protect fishermen, fish, and coastal communities. In a report suggesting economic waste in some of the world's commercial fisheries,<ref>{{cite news|title=Fisheries waste costs billions|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/7660011.stm|accessdate=21 June 2011|newspaper=BBC News|date=8 October 2008}}</ref> EDF advocates an approach:<ref name="costello">{{cite journal|last=Costello|first=Christopher|author2=Steven D.

The Environmental Defense Fund supports the [[Rigs-to-Reefs]] program in the [[Gulf of Mexico]], in which former offshore oil production platforms are converted to permanent artificial reefs. The EDF sees the program as a way to preserve the existing reef habitat of the oil platforms.<ref>Jack Sterne, [http://blogs.edf.org/edfish/2012/04/24/edf-stands-with-fishermen-in-calling-for-suspension-of-rig-removal-policy/ "EDF stands with fishermen in calling for suspension of rig removal policy"], ''EDF Oceans'', 24 Apr. 2012.</ref>

The policy has been criticized by some environmentalists.<ref>Larry Bernstein, [https://articles.washingtonpost.com/2013-05-22/national/39441658_1_oil-companies-energy-companies-kennedy-jr Environmental Defense Fund scolded by other green organizations on 'fracking'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131109052409/http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2013-05-22/national/39441658_1_oil-companies-energy-companies-kennedy-jr |date=2013-11-09 }}, Washington Post, 22 May 2013.</ref> EDF counsel and blogger Mark Brownstein answered:

<blockquote>Demand for natural gas is not going away, and neither is hydraulic fracturing. We must be clear-eyed about this, and fight to protect public health and the environment from unacceptable impacts. We must also work hard to put policies in place that ensure that natural gas serves as an enabler of renewable power generation, not an impediment to it. We fear that those who oppose all natural gas production everywhere are, in effect, making it harder for the U.S. economy to wean itself from dirty coal.<ref>Mark Brownstein, [http://blogs.edf.org/energyexchange/2012/09/10/why-edf-is-working-on-natural-gas/ Why EDF is working on natural gas], 10 Sept. 2012</ref></blockquote>
