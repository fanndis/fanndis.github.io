==Early life==
Ricci was born in [[Santa Monica, California]], the youngest of four children of Sarah (''née'' Murdoch) and Ralph Ricci.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.filmreference.com/film/96/Christina-Ricci.html|title=Christina Ricci Biography (1980–)|access-date=August 9, 2020|website=FilmReference.com}}</ref> Her mother worked as a [[Ford Agency]] model during the 1960s, and later became a real estate agent. Her father had a varied career, including jobs as a gym teacher, lawyer, drug counsellor, and [[Primal therapy|primal scream therapist]].<ref name=telegraph>{{cite web| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/3664790/The-vamp-is-a-lady.html| title=The vamp is a lady |work=The Telegraph |date=April 28, 2007 |access-date=May 7, 2018}}</ref> Regarding her ancestry, Ricci has stated, "The [[Italians|Italian]] blood has been bred out of me. There's an Italian four or five generations back who married an [[Irish people|Irish]] woman and they had all sons. So they married more Irish women, there were more sons, and more Irish women. Now I'm basically [[Ulster Scots people|Scots-Irish]]".<ref>{{cite web |title=The Minx Effect |url=http://www.christinaricci.info/cgi-dodger/showpage.pl?sel=interviews&url=iview7.ssf |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20031123103510/http://www.christinaricci.info/cgi-dodger/showpage.pl?sel=interviews&url=iview7.ssf |archive-date=November 23, 2003|access-date=November 22, 2007}}</ref>

==Career==

===Beginnings and child stardom (1990–1996)===
At the age of eight, Ricci was discovered by a local theater critic when she starred in a school production of ''[[The Twelve Days of Christmas]]''. Another child was originally cast in the part, but Ricci devised a plan to secure the role for herself: She taunted her rival so much that he punched her. When she told on him, he lost the part.<ref name="NYMag">Hill, Logan. [http://nymag.com/movies/profiles/44471/ "The Tao of Christina Ricci"], ''New York Magazine'', February 21, 2008. Retrieved February 24, 2008.</ref> She recalled, "I've always been a really ambitious person. I guess that's the first time it really reared its ugly head".<ref name=NYMag /> Soon thereafter, she featured in a pair of [[parody|spoof]] commercials on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''. The first of these featured Ricci as a child at a birthday party in which medical waste fell out of a burst [[piñata]], parodying the then-topical dumping of waste in the rivers of the United States' east coast. This gained Ricci her [[SAG-AFTRA]] card.<ref>Moynihan, Rob (January 18, 2016). "How I Got My SAG-AFTRA Card", ''[[TV Guide]]''. p. 12.</ref>

Ricci's big-screen debut was in the 1990 film ''[[Mermaids (1990 film)|Mermaids]]'', as [[Cher]]'s character's youngest daughter, Kate. She also appeared—alongside Cher and co-star [[Winona Ryder]]—in the music video for "[[The Shoop Shoop Song]]", which featured on the film's soundtrack. The following year, she starred as the morbidly precocious [[Wednesday Addams]] in [[Barry Sonnenfeld]]'s ''[[The Addams Family (1991 film)|The Addams Family]]'', based on [[The Addams Family|the cartoon of the same name]]. She reprised the role for the 1993 sequel, ''[[Addams Family Values]]''. Both films were a commercial success, and critics singled out Ricci's performances as highlights.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.deseretnews.com/article/700000027/Addams-Family-Values|title=Film review: Addams Family Values|work=[[Deseret News]]|access-date=September 26, 2018}}</ref>

Her next project, the live-action adaptation of ''[[Casper (film)|Casper]]'' (1995), was her first in a lead role. The film received mixed reviews, but it was the eighth highest-grossing production of the year.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/yearly/chart/?yr=1995&p=.htm|title=1995 Domestic Grosses|work=[[Box Office Mojo]]|access-date=September 20, 2018}}</ref> Ricci at the time starred in the adventure film ''[[Gold Diggers: The Secret of Bear Mountain]]'' (1995), and as the younger version of [[Rosie O'Donnell]]'s character, Roberta, in the [[coming-of-age story|coming-of-age]] drama [[Now and Then (film)|''Now and Then'']] (1995). The latter is often cited as the "female version" of ''[[Stand by Me (film)|Stand by Me]]'',<ref>{{cite web |url=http://jezebel.com/5096672/wheres-our-stand-by-me|title=Where's our Stand By Me?|work=[[Jezebel (website)|Jezebel]]|date=November 22, 2011 |access-date=September 12, 2015}}</ref> and has gained a [[cult following]] since its release.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.refinery29.uk/amp/2018/08/208292/now-and-then-review-dark-coming-of-age-movie|title=Now And Then Is A Lot Darker Than You Remember|publisher=[[Refinery29]]|date=August 25, 2018|access-date=September 20, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180920195757/https://www.refinery29.uk/amp/2018/08/208292/now-and-then-review-dark-coming-of-age-movie|archive-date=September 20, 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref> She also had a supporting role in ''[[Bastard out of Carolina (film)|Bastard out of Carolina]]'' (1996), which was the directorial debut of [[Anjelica Huston]], whom Ricci had previously worked with on the ''Addams Family'' films.

===Transition to adult roles (1997–1998)===
In 1997, Ricci starred in the [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]] remake of ''[[That Darn Cat (1997 film)|That Darn Cat]]'', which was a moderate success at the box office.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=thatdarncat.htm|title=That Darn Cat|publisher=Box Office Mojo|access-date=September 22, 2018}}</ref> Later that year, she made a shift into "legitimate [...] adult roles"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.avclub.com/christina-ricci-on-sleeping-over-at-cher-s-and-the-impo-1826995324/|title=Christina Ricci on sleeping over at Cher's and the importance of being Wednesday|work=The A.V. Club|date=June 28, 2018|access-date=September 26, 2018}}</ref> with her portrayal of the troubled, sexually curious Wendy Hood in [[Ang Lee]]'s critically acclaimed [[art film]], ''[[The Ice Storm (film)|The Ice Storm]]''. The part was originally given to [[Natalie Portman]], who pulled out when her parents decided that the role was too provocative.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/05/17/movies/film-on-the-far-side-of-innocence-politely-with-christina-ricci.html|title=On the Far Side of Innocence, Politely, With Christina Ricci|work=The New York Times|date=May 17, 1998|access-date=September 26, 2018}}</ref> In his review for ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', [[Peter Travers]] wrote, "The sight of the [film's] young stars [...] fiddling with each other may shock '90s prudes, but Lee handles these moments with dry wit and compassion [...] The adolescent members of the cast do their characters proud, with Ricci a particular standout. Her wonderfully funny and touching performance, capturing the defiance and confusion that come with puberty, is the film's crowning glory".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/movie-reviews/the-ice-storm-90646/|title=The Ice Storm|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=September 27, 1997|access-date=September 20, 2018}}</ref>

Ricci had a small role in [[Terry Gilliam]]'s offbeat [[road movie]], ''[[Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (film)|Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas]]'' (1998), which marked her first collaboration with [[Johnny Depp]]. In 1998, she also had starring roles in three [[independent film|independent]] features—''[[Buffalo '66]]'', where she played [[Vincent Gallo]]'s unwitting abductee-turned-love interest; [[John Waters (filmmaker)|John Waters]]' satirical comedy ''[[Pecker (film)|Pecker]]'', as the hard-nosed girlfriend of [[Edward Furlong]]; and [[Don Roos]]' black comedy-drama ''[[The Opposite of Sex]]'', playing the acid-tongued, manipulative Dede. For the latter, Ricci garnered critical acclaim and was nominated for a [[56th Golden Globe Awards|Golden Globe]] for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Comedy or Musical|Best Actress]]. ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'''s [[Todd McCarthy]] described her as "deadly funny", and felt that she delivered her dialogue with "the skill of a prospective [[Bette Davis]]".<ref>{{cite news| url=https://variety.com/1998/film/reviews/the-opposite-of-sex-1200452928/|title=The Opposite of Sex|work=Variety|date=February 9, 1998|access-date=September 20, 2018}}</ref> Several years later, ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' singled out her portrayal of Dede as one of the "Worst Oscar Snubs Ever".<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.ew.com/ew/gallery/0,,20178653,00.html#20408943 |title=Biggest Oscar Snubs Ever |work=Entertainment Weekly |access-date=February 21, 2010}}</ref>

=== Continued acclaim (1999–2004) ===
In 1999, Ricci starred for a second time with Johnny Depp, in [[Tim Burton]]'s [[Gothic film|gothic]] horror fantasy film ''[[Sleepy Hollow (film)|Sleepy Hollow]]''. The film was a commercial and critical success, and Ricci received a [[Saturn Award for Best Actress|Saturn Award]] for her portrayal of Katrina Van Tassel. On December 4, 1999, Ricci appeared as the guest host on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', and performed parodies of [[Britney Spears]] and the [[Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen|Olsen twins]]. During one of her skits, she accidentally punched actress [[Ana Gasteyer]] in the face.<ref>{{cite web|title=Onstage & Backstage: More "SNL" Secrets!

She starred in ''[[Prozac Nation (film)|Prozac Nation]]'' (2001), a drama based on [[Elizabeth Wurtzel]]'s best-selling
[[Prozac Nation (book)|memoir]]. The film—Ricci's first outing as a producer—received mixed reviews, but critics agreed that Ricci was the highlight, with Ed Gonzalez of ''[[Slant Magazine]]'' describing her as "splendid".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.slantmagazine.com/film/review/prozac-nation|title=Prozac Nation|work=Slant Magazine |date=June 14, 2004|access-date=September 20, 2018}}</ref>

Ricci's next role was in ''[[The Laramie Project (film)|The Laramie Project]]'', a drama based on the [[Matthew Shepard|murder of Matthew Shepard]]. The 2002 film, which premiered on [[HBO]], received positive reviews from critics; ''[[TV Guide]]'''s Matt Roush praised the performances of the cast, while noting that the film's examination of [[homophobia]] could "enlighten" viewers.<ref>Matt Roush. "The Lost Boy: Revisiting the Shepard Tragedy" ''[[TV Guide]]''; March 9, 2002.</ref> That same year, she starred with [[Kyle McLachlan]] in the British comedy-thriller ''[[Miranda (2002 film)|Miranda]]'', and guest-starred on the [[Ally McBeal (season 5)|fifth and final season]] of ''[[Ally McBeal]]'', appearing as lawyer Liza Bump in seven episodes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.buddytv.com/in-case-of-emergency/photos/richard-fish-greg-germann-and-eliza-bump-christina-ricci-get-51712.aspx |title=Richard Fish (Greg Germann) and Eliza Bump (Christina Ricci) get |publisher=BuddyTV |work=In Case of Emergency |access-date=August 10, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121102150333/http://www.buddytv.com/in-case-of-emergency/photos/richard-fish-greg-germann-and-eliza-bump-christina-ricci-get-51712.aspx |archive-date=November 2, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Also, she produced and starred in ''[[Pumpkin (film)|Pumpkin]]'', a black comedy about the relationship between a disabled young man and a [[Fraternities and sororities|sorority]] girl. In his review for ''[[The Chicago Sun-Times]]'', [[Roger Ebert]] wrote, "''Pumpkin'' is alive, and takes chances, and uses the wicked blade of satire in order to show up the complacent political correctness of other movies in its campus genre. It refuses to play it safe. And there is courage in the performances--for example [...] the way Ricci sails fearlessly into the risky material".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/pumpkin-2002|title=Pumpkin|work=Chicago Sun-Times|date=July 5, 2002|access-date=September 20, 2018}}</ref>
[[File:Christina Ricci at Gramercy Park Hotel.jpg|thumb|upright|Ricci at the [[Gramercy Park Hotel]], 2007]]
In 2003, Ricci took on the roles of a young girl wandering through England on foot in the British horror film ''[[The Gathering (2003 film)|The Gathering]]'', the former girlfriend of an up-and-coming movie star enjoying all the perks of celebrity in [[Adam Goldberg]]'s ''[[I Love Your Work]]'', and that of a manipulative, vain, indecisive, vindictive, and neurotic girlfriend in [[Woody Allen]]'s ''[[Anything Else]]'', in which she starred with [[Jason Biggs]]. In his review of the latter, [[A. O. Scott]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' described the film as an "antiromantic comedy", and said that Ricci played her role with "feral, neurotic glee".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/09/19/movies/film-review-woody-allen-as-life-coach.html|title=Woody Allen As Life Coach|work=The New York Times|date=September 19, 2003|access-date=September 26, 2018}}</ref>

Ricci starred opposite [[Charlize Theron]] in the [[biographical film|biographical]] crime drama, ''[[Monster (2003 film)|Monster]]'', also in 2003. Ricci's character—Selby Wall—was a fictionalized version of Tyria Moore, the real-life partner of serial killer [[Aileen Wuornos]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.afterellen.com/people/79129-christina-ricci-on-playing-gay-in-monster-the-laramie-project-and-being-de-gayed-in-now-and-then|title=Christina Ricci on playing gay in "Monster", The Laramie Project" and being de-gayed in "Now and Then"|work=[[afterellen.com]]|date=September 13, 2010|access-date=September 12, 2015}}</ref> Speaking of her decision to take the part, Ricci said it posed a challenge as it "goes completely against who I am [as a person]", and described the filming experience as "dark and depressing".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2004/mar/28/features.magazine|title=Christina Ricci: Hidden Depths|work=The Guardian|date=March 28, 2004|access-date=September 12, 2015}}</ref> The film was directed by [[Patty Jenkins]] and received rave reviews upon its release, with most critics directing their attention toward Theron, who went on to receive an [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Academy Award]] for her portrayal of Wuornos. She acknowledged Ricci during her acceptance speech, calling her the film's "unsung hero".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://aaspeechesdb.oscars.org/link/076-3/|title=Charlize Theron|publisher=Academy Awards Acceptance Speech Database|access-date=September 21, 2018}}</ref> Of Ricci's performance, Roger Ebert said, "[she] finds the correct note for Selby [...] so correct [that] some critics have mistaken it for bad acting, when in fact it is sublime acting in its portrayal of a bad actor. She plays Selby as clueless, dim, in over her head, picking up cues from moment to moment, cobbling her behavior out of notions borrowed from bad movies, old songs, and barroom romances. Selby must have walked into a gay bar for the first time only a few weeks ago, and studied desperately to figure out how to present herself. Selby and Aileen are often trying to improvise the next line they think the other wants to hear".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/amp/monster-2003|title=Monster|publisher=RogerEbert.com|date=January 1, 2004|access-date=September 20, 2018}}</ref>

Her portrayal of [[hypersexuality|nymphomaniac]] Rae in the 2006 drama ''[[Black Snake Moan (film)|Black Snake Moan]]'', opposite [[Samuel L. Jackson]], was particularly well received.

===Focus on television (2011–present)===
Ricci played a kindhearted waitress in ''[[Bucky Larson: Born to Be a Star]]'' (2011), a comedy written by [[Adam Sandler]]. The film was universally panned by critics, and holds the distinction of being one of only a small number of features to obtain a [[List of films with a 0% rating on Rotten Tomatoes|0% score on Rotten Tomatoes]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/bucky_larson_born_to_be_a_star/|title=Bucky Larson: Born to Be a Star|publisher=Rotten Tomatoes|access-date=September 26, 2018}}</ref> Writing for ''Variety'', Andrew Barker called it "one of the most astonishingly unfunny films of this or any other year", but commended Ricci, whom he felt gave her role "more than it deserves".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/2011/film/reviews/bucky-larson-born-to-be-a-star-1117946034/|title=Bucky Larson: Born to Be a Star|work=Variety|date=September 10, 2011|access-date=September 26, 2018}}</ref> From 2011 to 2012, Ricci appeared as stewardess Maggie Ryan on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] drama series ''[[Pan Am (TV series)|Pan Am]]'', which was set in the 1960s and based on the iconic [[Pan American World Airways|airline of the same name]]. The series garnered generally positive reviews,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/pan_am/s01|title=Pan Am: Season 1|publisher=Rotten Tomatoes|access-date=September 26, 2018}}</ref> but, due to a decline in viewing figures during its initial run of 14 episodes, the producers decided not to proceed with a second season.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://tvseriesfinale.com/tv-show/pan-am-cancelled-season-two-22997|title=''Pan Am'': (Finally) Cancelled; No Season Two|work=TV Series Finale|date=May 12, 2012|access-date=May 13, 2012}}</ref> In April 2012, Ricci returned to the stage, playing [[Hermia]] in an [[off-Broadway]] revival of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare's]] ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]''.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/15/theater/christina-ricci-back-onstage.html|title=The Course to the Stage Never Did Run Smooth|work=New York Times|date=April 11, 2012|access-date=April 23, 2012|first=Alexis|last=Soloski}}</ref>

In 2012, Ricci also starred as a mistress alongside [[Robert Pattinson]] and [[Uma Thurman]] in the little-seen period film ''[[Bel Ami (2012 film)|Bel Ami]]'', based on the 1885 French [[Bel Ami|novel of the same name]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/bel-ami-2012|title=BEL AMI|access-date=June 25, 2014}}</ref> and in 2013, she headlined the Australian film ''[[Around the Block (film)|Around The Block]]'', as an American drama teacher who befriends an [[Aboriginal Australians|Aboriginal]] boy during the [[2004 Redfern riots]]. She subsequently provided voices for the [[animation|animated]] films ''[[The Smurfs 2]]'' (2013) and ''[[The Hero of Color City]]'' (2014).

In 2014, Ricci played the [[Lizzie Borden|title character]] in ''[[Lizzie Borden Took an Ax]]'', a [[Lifetime (TV network)|Lifetime]] film inspired by the true story of Borden, who was tried and acquitted of the murders of her father and stepmother in 1892, and in 2015 she reprised the role for the eight-part television series ''[[The Lizzie Borden Chronicles]]''. The latter received generally positive reviews; Jane Borden of ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' called it "playful, wicked brain candy", adding that "Ricci was born to play [a] 19th-century ax murderer".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2015/04/lizzie-borden-christina-ricci|title=''The Lizzie Borden Chronicles'' Is Playful, Wicked Brain Candy|work=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]] |first=Jane |last=Borden |date=April 5, 2015|access-date=September 26, 2018}}</ref> Writing for ''The New York Times'', [[Neil Genzlinger]] described Ricci as "gleeful and ruthless",<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/01/arts/television/review-the-lizzie-borden-chronicles-a-lifetime-series-starring-christina-ricci.html |title=Review: ''The Lizzie Borden Chronicles'', a Lifetime Series Starring Christina Ricci |work=[[The New York Times]] |first=Neil |last=Genzlinger |date=March 31, 2015 |access-date=September 26, 2018}}</ref> while Keith Uhlich of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' felt that she and co-star [[Clea DuVall]] had "a delectable rapport not too far removed from Bette Davis and [[Joan Crawford]] at their [[psycho-biddy|hag-horror]] peak in ''[[What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?

In 2016, Ricci played a woman who receives a life-changing revelation from the woman she thought was her sister in the independent drama ''[[Mothers and Daughters (2016 film)|Mothers and Daughters]]'', as part of an ensemble cast, consisting of [[Sharon Stone]], [[Susan Sarandon]], [[Selma Blair]], [[Mira Sorvino]] and [[Courteney Cox]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://observer.com/2016/05/mothers-and-daughters-takes-on-a-familiar-theme-and-comes-up-wanting/|title='Mothers and Daughters' Takes on a Familiar Theme and Comes Up Wanting|date=May 5, 2016|website=The New York Observer|access-date=October 11, 2017}}</ref> Ricci next starred in the 2017 [[Amazon Video]] miniseries ''[[Z: The Beginning of Everything]]'', which presented a fictionalized version of the life of American socialite [[Zelda Fitzgerald]]. Ricci served as a producer on the series, which, she later acknowledged, is how she got the lead part; "I can tell you that in my experience, I have never, ever been cast in a role like this and I would never get this part normally [...] I'm just not seen in that way. There are categories that people fall into, and types, and I was never a romantic lead. Basically, you couldn't get five people in a room to agree that I should be a romantic lead. I could get one person, but there's always more than one person whose opinion matters".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/tv/0/christina-ricci-interview-dont-think-child-actor-healthy-people/|title=Christina Ricci interview: 'I don't think that being a child actor is healthy for people'|work=The Telegraph|date=January 28, 2017|access-date=September 20, 2018}}</ref>
