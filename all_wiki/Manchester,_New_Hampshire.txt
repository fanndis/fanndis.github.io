'''Manchester''' is a city in southern [[New Hampshire]], United States. It is the [[List of cities by population in New England|most populous city]] in northern [[New England]] (the [[U.S. state|states]] of [[Maine]], New Hampshire, and [[Vermont]]). As of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]] the city had a population of 109,565,<ref name="Census 2010">{{cite web| url=http://factfinder.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/DEC/10_DP/G001/0600000US3301145140| title=Geographic Identifiers: 2010 Demographic Profile Data (G001): Manchester city, New Hampshire| publisher=U.S. Census Bureau, American Factfinder| accessdate=August 5, 2014}}</ref> and in 2019 the population was estimated to be 112,673.<ref name="USCensusEst2019"/>

Manchester is, along with [[Nashua, New Hampshire|Nashua]], one of two [[county seat|seats]] of New Hampshire's most populous county, [[Hillsborough County, New Hampshire|Hillsborough County]]. Manchester lies near the northern end of the [[Northeast megalopolis]] and straddles the banks of the [[Merrimack River]]. It was first named by the merchant and inventor [[Samuel Blodgett]], namesake of Samuel Blodget Park and Blodget Street in the city's North End. His vision was to create a great industrial center similar to that of the original [[Manchester]] in England, which was the world's first industrialized city.<ref>[http://www.Citytowninfo.com/places/new-hampshire/manchester Manchester, New Hampshire] Publisher: CityTownInfo.com Retrieved: March 4, 2014.</ref>

==History==
{{see also|Timeline of Manchester, New Hampshire}}

Native [[Pennacook]] [[Native Americans of the United States|Indians]] called [[Amoskeag Falls]] on the Merrimack River—the area that became the heart of Manchester—''Namaoskeag'', meaning "good fishing place".<ref>{{cite book| url=https://archive.org/details/manchesterbriefr00clar_0| title=Manchester: A Brief Record of Its Past and a Picture of Its Present, Including an Account of Its Settlement and of Its Growth as a Town and City; a History of Its Schools, Churches, Societies, Banks| publisher=J. B. Clarke| last=Clarke| first=J.B.| date=1875| page=[https://archive.org/details/manchesterbriefr00clar_0/page/11 11]}}</ref> In 1722, [[John Goffe|John Goffe III]] settled beside [[Cohas Brook]], later building a dam and sawmill at what was dubbed "Old Harry's Town". It was granted by [[Province of Massachusetts Bay|Massachusetts]] in 1727 as "Tyngstown" to veterans of [[Queen Anne's War]] who served in 1703 under Captain William Tyng.<ref name=brit>{{cite web|url = http://www.britannica.com/place/Manchester-New-Hampshire|title = Manchester, New Hampshire|date = December 2, 2014|accessdate = June 22, 2015|website = Encyclopædia Britannica Online|publisher = Encyclopædia Britannica}}</ref> But at New Hampshire's 1741 separation from Massachusetts, the grant was ruled invalid and substituted with [[Wilton, Maine]], resulting in a 1751 rechartering by Governor [[Benning Wentworth]] as "Derryfield"—a name that lives on in Derryfield Park, Derryfield Country Club, and the private [[Derryfield School]].<ref name=brit/>

In 1807, Samuel Blodget opened a canal and lock system to allow vessels passage around the falls, part of a network developing to link the area with Boston. He envisioned a great industrial center arising, "the Manchester of America", in reference to [[Manchester]], England, then at the forefront of the [[Industrial Revolution]].<ref name=brit/><ref name=":1">{{Cite book|title = Manchester: The Mills And The Immigrant Experience|last = Samson|first = Gary|publisher = Arcadia Publishing|year = 2000|isbn = 978-0-7385-0477-3|location = Portsmouth, New Hampshire|pages = 13–18}}</ref> In 1809, [[Benjamin Prichard]] and others built a water-powered cotton spinning mill on the western bank of the Merrimack. Apparently following Blodgett's suggestion, Derryfield was renamed "Manchester" in 1810, the year the mill was incorporated as the [[Amoskeag Manufacturing Company|Amoskeag Cotton & Woolen Manufacturing Company]].<ref>Tamara K. Hareven, ''Amoskeag: Life and Work in an American Factory City''</ref> It would be purchased in 1825 by entrepreneurs from Massachusetts, expanded to three mills in 1826, and then incorporated in 1831 as the [[Amoskeag Manufacturing Company]].<ref name=brit/><ref name=":1" />

Amoskeag engineers and architects planned a model [[company town]] on the eastern bank,  founded in 1838 with Elm Street as its main thoroughfare. Incorporation as a city followed for Manchester in 1846, soon home to the largest cotton mill in the world—Mill No. 11, stretching {{convert|900|ft|m}} long by {{convert|103|ft|m}} wide, and containing 4,000 looms. Other products made in the community included shoes, cigars, and paper. The Amoskeag foundry made rifles, sewing machines, textile machinery, fire engines, and locomotives in a division called the [[Amoskeag Locomotive Works]] (later, the [[Manchester Locomotive Works]]). The rapid growth of the mills demanded a large influx of workers, resulting in a flood of immigrants, particularly [[French Canadian]]s.  Many residents descend from these workers. The Amoskeag Manufacturing Company went out of business in 1935, although its red brick mills have been renovated for other uses. Indeed, the [[mill town]]'s 19th-century affluence left behind some of the finest [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] commercial, municipal, and residential architecture in the state.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Manchester: The Mills And The Immigrant Experience|last = Samson|first = Gary|publisher = Arcadia Publishing|year = 2000|isbn = 978-0-7385-0477-3|location = Portsmouth, New Hampshire|pages = 22–27}}</ref>

==Geography==
[[File:DowntownManch.JPG|thumb|right|View of downtown from the north]]
Manchester is in south-central New Hampshire, {{convert|18|mi}} south of [[Concord, New Hampshire|Concord]], the state capital, and the same distance north of [[Nashua, New Hampshire|Nashua]], the second-largest city in the state. Manchester is {{convert|51|mi}} north-northwest of [[Boston]], the largest city in New England.

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|90.6|sqkm|order=flip}}, of which {{convert|85.7|sqkm|order=flip}} are land and {{convert|4.8|sqkm|order=flip}} are water, comprising 5.33% of the city.<ref name="Census 2010"/>  Manchester is drained by the Merrimack River and its tributaries the [[Piscataquog River]] and [[Cohas Brook]]. [[Massabesic Lake]] is on the eastern border. The highest point in Manchester is atop Wellington Hill, where the elevation reaches {{convert|570|ft|m}} above [[sea level]].

===Neighborhoods===
{{Main|Neighborhoods in Manchester, New Hampshire}}
The Manchester Planning Board, in its 2010 Master Plan, defines 25 neighborhoods within the city.  LivableMHT has drawn maps of the neighborhoods and neighborhood village centers as defined by the city.<ref>[http://www.manchesternh.gov/website/Departments/PlanningCommDev/MasterPlan/tabid/1421/Default.aspx Master Plan]. Manchesternh.gov (February 6, 2012). Retrieved on August 2, 2013.</ref> Recognition of particular neighborhoods varies, with some having neighborhood associations, but none have any legal or political authority.

The major neighborhoods, historically, include Amoskeag, Rimmon Heights, Notre Dame/McGregorville and Piscataquog/Granite Square also known as "Piscat" on the West Side; and the North End, Janeville/Corey Square, Hallsville and Bakersville on the East Side; along with Youngsville and Goffes Falls on the periphery of the city.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.davidrumsey.com/rumsey/Size4/D0115/2023042.jpg?userid=15&username=lunaadmin&resolution=4&servertype=JVA&cid=8&iid=RUMSEY&vcid=NA&usergroup=Rumsey3x&profileid=13 |title=Map |website=davidrumsey.com}}</ref>

In 2007, the city began a Neighborhood Initiatives program to "insure that our neighborhoods are vibrant, livable areas since these are the portions of the city where most of the residents spend their time living, playing, shopping and going to school."<ref>[http://www.yourmanchesternh.com/plans-and-projects/current-projects.aspx City of Manchester: Current Projects] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100818165507/http://www.yourmanchesternh.com/plans-and-projects/current-projects.aspx |date=August 18, 2010}}. Yourmanchesternh.com (June 30, 2010). Retrieved on August 2, 2013.</ref> The purpose of this initiative is to foster vibrancy and redevelopment in the neighborhoods, and to restore the sense of neighborhood communities that had been overlooked in the city for some time. The city began the program with street-scape and infrastructure improvements in the Rimmon Heights neighborhood of the West Side, which has spurred growth and investment in and by the community.<ref>[http://www.nhpr.org/node/16970 Oh Goodies: Wal-Mart Goes Mail-Order Gourmet | New Hampshire Public Radio]. Nhpr.org (November 14, 2012). Retrieved on August 2, 2013.</ref> Despite the success of the program in Rimmon Heights, it was unclear in recent years how the city planned to implement similar programs throughout the city. The city announced plans for extending the Neighborhood Initiatives program to the Hollow neighborhood in February 2012.<ref>[http://www.unionleader.com/article/20120211/NEWS15/120219990 Only in Print: Big-dollar facelift is hoped for the Hollow | New Hampshire Only in Print].

===Surrounding development===
The urban core of Manchester extends beyond its city limits in several directions, particularly west and south of downtown, including:

* [[Pinardville, New Hampshire|Pinardville]]: In the town of [[Goffstown, New Hampshire|Goffstown]], Pinardville is a fairly dense, former [[streetcar suburb]] along Mast Road to the west of Manchester. It is home to [[Saint Anselm College]].
* River Corridor: In the town of [[Bedford, New Hampshire|Bedford]], the River Corridor is a mid-density, primarily shopping district along South River Road about two-and-a-half miles from downtown Manchester. The area has recently implemented [[Tax Increment Financing]] to improve and maintain infrastructure, and the Town of Bedford's most recent master plan has called for increasing mixed-use development and promoting walkability and transit use, though the [[Manchester Transit Authority]] bus service in the area was recently curtailed following a decision by the Town of Bedford to discontinue funding service.
* Northeast Bedford: The northeast section of [[Bedford, New Hampshire|Bedford]] is a mainly low to mid-density suburban residential area near the terminus of the former St. Joseph's streetcar line along Donald Street and [[post-war]] development along Boynton Street, with some businesses scattered throughout. The area does not have a formal name, but the section along Boynton Street has variously been called the Plains and the Pines. The northern area is more rural with large portions owned by [[Saint Anselm College]].
* [[South Hooksett, New Hampshire|South Hooksett]]: The southeastern portion of the town of [[Hooksett, New Hampshire|Hooksett]] is a sprawling, suburban shopping area north of Manchester.
* [[Manchester–Boston Regional Airport]] near the city's southeastern corner, and the surrounding industrial areas extend into neighboring [[Londonderry, New Hampshire|Londonderry]].

===Climate===
Manchester has a four-season [[humid continental climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Dfa''), with long, cold, snowy winters, and very warm and somewhat humid summers; spring and fall in between are crisp and relatively brief transitions. The monthly daily average temperature ranges from {{convert|24.4|°F|1}} in January to {{convert|72.5|°F|1}} in July. On average, there are 11&nbsp;days of highs at or above {{convert|90|°F|0}} and 3.0&nbsp;days of lows at or below {{convert|0|°F|0}} annually.<ref name="NCDC txt KMHT"/> Precipitation is well-spread throughout the year, though winter is the driest season while early spring tends to be the wettest. Record temperatures range from {{convert|−29|°F|0}} on February 16, 1943, up to {{convert|103|°F|0}} on July 22, 2011.<ref name= "NWS Gray/Portland, ME (GYX)"/>

==Rankings==
Manchester often appears favorably in lists ranking the affordability and livability of U.S. cities. In 2015, [[CNNMoney.com]] ranked it #1 in the U.S. for small businesses, and in 2009, another site ranked Manchester 13th in a list of the 100 best cities in the U.S. to live and launch a business.<ref name=money1/><ref name="mutualfunds.info"/> In addition, [[Kiplinger]] voted Manchester the second most tax-friendly city in the U.S., second only to [[Anchorage, Alaska]].<ref name=finance.yahoo.com/> Also in 2009, ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine ranked the Manchester region first on its list of "America's 100 Cheapest Places to Live."<ref name=forbes1/> According to the Equality of Opportunity Project, released in 2013, Manchester ranked as the seventh best metropolitan area in the U.S. in terms of upward income mobility.<ref name=bi/> In 2014, Forbes magazine ranked the city among the top 5 most educated cities in the United States.<ref name=forbes2/>

==Economy==
[[File:Amoskeag Bank Building, Manchester, NH.jpg|thumb|right|Amoskeag Bank in 1913: At 10 stories, it was Manchester's "skyscraper" for over a half-century.]]

Manchester is northern New England's largest city.  Its economy has changed greatly, as Manchester was primarily a textile mill town throughout much of its history. In March 2009, [[Kiplinger]] voted Manchester the second most tax friendly city in the U.S., after [[Anchorage, Alaska]].<ref name="finance.yahoo.com"/> Earlier in the year, [[CNN]] rated Manchester 13th in its top 100 best places in the U.S. to live and launch a business.<ref name="mutualfunds.info"/> Manchester is nicknamed the Queen City, as well as the more recently coined "Manch Vegas".<ref name=ManchVegas>{{cite news

The [[Mall of New Hampshire]], on Manchester's southern fringe near the intersection of Interstates 93 and 293, is the city's main retail center.  In 2001, the [[Verizon Wireless Arena]], a venue seating more than 10,000, opened for major concerts and sporting events, enhancing the city's downtown revitalization efforts with a major hotel and convention center already in place across the street from the arena. The building was renamed the [[SNHU Arena]] in 2016, after Manchester's [[Southern New Hampshire University]].

Manchester is the home of [[Segway PT|Segway, Inc.]], manufacturers of a two-wheeled, self-balancing electric vehicle invented by [[Dean Kamen]].

As of 2017, the following organizations and companies were the largest employers in Manchester:<ref name="Manchester NH Quick Facts">{{cite web| url=https://www.yourmanchesternh.com/Quick-Facts| title=Quick Facts| publisher=Manchester Economic Development Office| accessdate=February 9, 2019}}</ref>

===Downtown===
Downtown Manchester's [[City Hall Plaza (Manchester)|One City Hall Plaza]] stands 22 stories high, quickly followed by the all-black, 20-story [[Brady Sullivan Plaza]], formerly known as the [[Hampshire Plaza]]. They are the tallest New England buildings north of [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]]. The Sullivan Plaza is shorter than City Hall Plaza by a mere {{convert|16|ft}}. Other major buildings include the 18-story Wall Street Apartments tower; the 14-story, recently renamed Brady Sullivan Tower, which was the former New Hampshire Insurance building; the 12-story [[DoubleTree]] Hotel and Convention Center Manchester (which serves the SNHU Arena across the street), the Carpenter Center (a former hotel), and the Hampshire Towers condominium building; the 10-story Citizens Bank Building, which was, for much of the early- and mid-20th century, Manchester's iconic Amoskeag Bank "skyscraper"; and several high-rises of or exceeding 10 stories on the city's West Side. This partial list only includes residential and commercial buildings and does not include hospitals, spires and domes, etc.

The [[SNHU Arena]] has become the centerpiece of downtown Manchester. The venue can seat slightly less than 12,000 patrons for concerts, and at least 10,000-seat configurations for sporting and other forms of entertainment. It has also hosted major recording artists and comedians, national touring theatrical productions, family-oriented shows, and fairs since it opened in 2001.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.verizonwirelessarena.com/arena_info/default.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=May 12, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140529101017/http://www.verizonwirelessarena.com/arena_info/default.asp |archivedate=May 29, 2014 }}</ref> The [[Northeast Delta Dental Stadium]] (formerly MerchantsAuto.com Stadium) is a baseball park on the Merrimack River in downtown Manchester and is home to the local [[minor league baseball|AA baseball]] affiliate of the [[Toronto Blue Jays]], the [[New Hampshire Fisher Cats]].  Historic [[Gill Stadium]] supported professional minor-league baseball into the early 21st century and continues to be a viable and popular downtown venue for many sporting and entertainment events, seating nearly 4,000 patrons, depending on the event format.

In recent years there has been continual redevelopment of the Amoskeag Millyard and its residential Historic District. The increasing popularity of downtown living has caused many properties originally built as tenement housing for mill workers in the 19th century to be converted to stylish, eclectic residential condominiums. Many new retail stores and higher education institutions, including the [[University of New Hampshire at Manchester]], have been uniquely retro-fitted into properties along Commercial and Canal Street.

===Shopping===
Manchester has three main retail areas: downtown Manchester, South Willow Street (NH Route 28), and Second Street (NH Route 3A) on the West Side. The [[Mall of New Hampshire]] is on South Willow Street, and, with more than 125 stores, is one of the largest shopping centers in southern New Hampshire and central New England.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

==Arts and culture==
[[File:Currier Art Museum, Manchester, NH MG 2792.JPG|thumb|right|[[Currier Museum of Art]] at 150 Ash Street]]

Cultural landmarks include the historic [[Palace Theatre (Manchester, New Hampshire)|Palace Theatre]], the [[Currier Museum of Art]], the [[New Hampshire Institute of Art]], the Franco-American Center, the Manchester Historic Association Millyard Museum, the Massabesic Audubon Center, the Amoskeag Fishways Learning and Visitors Center, the Lawrence L. Lee Scouting Museum and Max I. Silber Library, the [[Zimmerman House (Manchester, New Hampshire)|Zimmerman House]] designed by [[Frank Lloyd Wright]], and the SEE Science Center.<ref>{{cite web|title=SEE Science Center|url=https://www.see-sciencecenter.org|accessdate=September 1, 2017}}</ref> [[Valley Cemetery]], the resting place of numerous prominent citizens since 1841, is an early example of a garden-style burial ground.

The [[John F. Kennedy Memorial Coliseum]] is another, smaller venue in downtown Manchester with a capacity of approximately 3,000 seats. It was completed in 1963, serves as home ice for the Manchester Central and Memorial High School hockey teams, and is home to the Southern New Hampshire Skating Club.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.manchesternh.gov/Departments/ParksandRecreation/ParksFacilities/JFKMemorialColiseum.aspx|title=JFK Memorial Coliseum|first=City of Manchester NH Official Web|last=Site|publisher=}}</ref>

The nickname "ManchVegas" was derived from illegal gambling in local businesses during the late 1980s or early 1990s. Many pizza shops and local bars had video poker machines that would pay out real money. The nickname was coined following a citywide campaign of law enforcement. It was then adopted as a lampoon of the city's limited entertainment opportunities. The term has since become a source of pride as the city's entertainment scene has grown. By 2003 it was well enough known that a note on Virtualtourist.com said, "Residents reflect the regional dry humor by referring to sedate Manchester as 'ManchVegas'."<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.virtualtourist.com/travel/North_America/United_States_of_America/New_Hampshire/Manchester-831355/Local_Customs-Manchester-R-1.html| title=Manchester Local Customs| publisher=VirtualTourist.com| accessdate=June 7, 2010}}</ref> By 2005, an article in Manchester's ''[[Hippo Press|Hippo]]'' (a local alternative weekly) said that then-Mayor [[Robert A. Baines]] "is pushing to replace the nickname ManchVegas with Manchhattan" (meaning Manchester+Manhattan).<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.hippopress.com/pubnote/pubnote05818.html| title=Manchester Parks need help |work=[[Hippo Press|Hippo]] | accessdate=June 7, 2010}}</ref> In 2009 the film ''Monsters, Marriage and Murder in ManchVegas'' was released referencing Manchester's popular nickname and using much of the city as its backdrop.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1463411 |title=Monsters, Marriage and Murder in Manchvegas|publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]]}}</ref>

Manchester has a growing collective of artists, due in large part to the influx of young students at the [[New Hampshire Institute of Art]], [[Southern New Hampshire University]], and the [[University of New Hampshire at Manchester]]. Slam Free or Die, New Hampshire's only weekly slam poetry venue, is in Manchester and was voted "Best Poetry Venue in the World" <ref>{{cite web|url=http://patch.com/new-hampshire/bedford-nh/slam-free-or-die-voted-best-poetry-venue-in-the-world/#.VCBIneefhkU|title=Slam Free or Die Voted "Best Poetry Venue in the World"|date=July 26, 2013|publisher=}}</ref> by readers of Write Bloody Publishing.

The [[Manchester City Library]] has served the city's residents since the mid-1850s and has been housed in the Carpenter Memorial Building on Pine Street since 1914. There is a branch location on North Main Street on the West Side.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.manchester.lib.nh.us/Visit-Us|title=Manchester City Library - Visit Us|last=|first=|date=|website=Manchester City Library|access-date=}}</ref>

The city is home to [[McIntyre Ski Area]], which opened in 1971. There are also college sports teams that play in and out of the city.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.snhu.edu/sports-and-recreation.asp|title = SNHU Athletics|date = |accessdate = April 29, 2015|website = Southern New Hampshire University - Official Website|publisher = SNHU|last = |first = }}</ref>

===Professional===
Manchester is the only city in New Hampshire with a professional sports team: three-time [[Eastern League (baseball)|Eastern League]] champions, the [[New Hampshire Fisher Cats]], play at [[Northeast Delta Dental Stadium]]. From 2001 to 2015, the [[Manchester Monarchs (AHL)|Manchester Monarchs]] played in the [[American Hockey League]]. In their final [[2014–15 AHL season|season]] in Manchester, the Monarchs won the [[2015 Calder Cup playoffs|league championship]]. From 2015 to 2019, the city hosted the lower-division [[Manchester Monarchs (ECHL)|Manchester Monarchs]] in the [[ECHL]].

Manchester is incorporated as a city under the laws of the state of New Hampshire, and operates under a strong mayoral form of government. The mayor serves as chairman of the fourteen-member Board of Mayor and Aldermen, the city's legislative body. Each of Manchester's twelve wards elects a single alderman, and two additional at-large members are elected citywide. [[Joyce Craig]] is the current [[List of mayors of Manchester, New Hampshire|mayor]].

The mayor also serves as the chair of the board of school committee. Like the board of aldermen, the school board has twelve members elected by ward and two at-large members. The school board is not a city department; rather, it is a school district coterminous with the city, which obtains financing from the Board of Mayor and Aldermen.

In the [[New Hampshire Senate]], Manchester is represented by three state senators, all [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]]:

* Kevin Cavanaugh (District 16): Wards 1, 2, 12 
* [[Donna Soucy]] (District 18): Wards 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
* [[Lou D'Allesandro]] (District 20): Wards 3, 4, 10, 11

In the [[Executive Council of New Hampshire|New Hampshire Executive Council]], Manchester is included within the 4th District and is represented by Republican [[Ted Gatsas]],<ref>{{Cite web| url=https://www.nh.gov/council/districts/d4/index.htm| title=District 4: Councilor Theodore L. Gatsas| publisher=State of New Hampshire| access-date=January 10, 2019}}</ref> the city's former mayor. Manchester is included within [[New Hampshire's 1st congressional district]] and is represented by Democrat [[Chris Pappas (politician)|Chris C. Pappas]].

At the presidential level, Manchester is fairly independent, but like most other large cities it does have a slight Democratic tilt. [[George W. Bush]] narrowly carried the city by 170 votes in 2004, and other presidential elections have remained close.

==Infrastructure==

===Transportation===
[[File:Union Station, Manchester, NH.jpg|thumb|right|[[Manchester Union Station]], c. 1910]]

====Air====
[[Manchester-Boston Regional Airport]], the fourth-largest passenger and third-largest cargo airport in [[New England]], serves the city.

====Roads====
[[Interstate Highway|Interstates]] [[Interstate 93|93]] and [[Interstate 293|293]] and the [[F.E. Everett Turnpike]] are multi-lane highways that connect the metropolitan area to [[Concord, New Hampshire|Concord]] and the [[White Mountains (New Hampshire)|White Mountains]] to the north and [[Nashua, New Hampshire|Nashua]] and [[Boston]] to the south. [[New Hampshire Route 101|NH 101]] is a four-lane highway eastbound from Manchester to [[Hampton Beach, New Hampshire|Hampton Beach]], connecting the city with the southeastern part of the state and the [[Seacoast Region (New Hampshire)|seacoast]], as well as [[Maine]] and the [[Massachusetts]] [[North Shore (Massachusetts)|North Shore]] via [[Interstate 95]]. West of Manchester, NH 101 is a two-lane highway serving as the main artery to [[Keene, New Hampshire|Keene]], the [[Monadnock region]], and other points in southwestern New Hampshire, eventually connecting to NH 9 and the state's border with Vermont. [[U.S. Route 3 in New Hampshire|U.S. Route 3]] and state routes [[New Hampshire Route 3A|3A]], [[New Hampshire Route 28|28]], [[New Hampshire Route 28A|28A]], and [[New Hampshire Route Bypass 28|Bypass 28]] also flow through the city.

A direct highway access with the airport connects the Everett Turnpike just south of the city with the Manchester-Boston Regional Airport via a connector road crossing the Merrimack River known as Raymond Wieczorek Drive (in honor of a former Manchester mayor instrumental in getting the access road built). The connector road also intersects with highways U.S. 3 and NH 3A.

====Bus====
The [[Manchester Transit Authority]] runs several bus routes throughout the city and surrounding areas. [[Concord Coach Lines|Concord Coach]] and [[Boston Express]] run commuter services to Boston and other parts of the state. [[Vermont Transit Lines]] (affiliated with [[Greyhound Lines]]) has lines to Montreal. In 2008, Boston Express moved to suburb [[Londonderry, New Hampshire]], and now provides limited service to downtown Manchester.

====Passenger rail====
Into the 1950s, numerous [[Boston and Maine Railroad]] trains operated out of [[Manchester Union Station]], going to points northwest as far as [[Montreal]], north to [[Woodsville, New Hampshire|Woodsville]], east to [[Portsmouth, New Hampshire|Portsmouth]] and south to [[Boston]], among these the ''[[Alouette (train)|Alouette]]'' and the ''[[Ambassador (B&M train)|Ambassador]]'' (both of these being Boston - Montreal trains).<ref>{{cite journal |title=Boston & Maine Railroad, Tables 1, 2, 4, 7, 19, 37, 38|journal=Official Guide of the Railways |publisher=National Railway Publication Company |volume=82 |issue=8 |date=January 1950}}</ref> The last services were a once a day train between Boston and [[Concord, New Hampshire|Concord]]; this service ended in 1967.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Boston & Maine Railroad, Table 1|journal=Official Guide of the Railways |publisher=National Railway Publication Company |volume=100 |issue=2 |date=July 1967}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |title=Boston & Maine Railroad, Table 1|journal=Official Guide of the Railways |publisher=National Railway Publication Company |volume=100 |issue=5 |date=October 1967}}</ref>

The possibility of returning train service, with Manchester being served by the "Capital Corridor", an extension of the [[MBTA Commuter Rail|MBTA commuter rail]] from its current terminus in [[Lowell, Massachusetts]], to [[Concord, New Hampshire|Concord]], which would also include a stop at Manchester-Boston Regional Airport, is being studied by the [[New Hampshire Rail Transit Authority]] and New Hampshire Department of Transportation, which have received federal funding for studying and planning the route.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.nh.gov/dot/programs/nhrta/documents/2010-10-29NHRTAminutes.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=May 17, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605145534/http://www.nh.gov/dot/programs/nhrta/documents/2010-10-29NHRTAminutes.pdf |archive-date=June 5, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The Capital Corridor route is also being studied as a possible future high-speed rail line connecting [[Montreal]] and Boston.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fra.dot.gov/rpd/downloads/HSIPR_Summary_of_Federal_Investments.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=May 18, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320095942/http://www.fra.dot.gov/rpd/downloads/HSIPR_Summary_of_Federal_Investments.pdf |archivedate=March 20, 2012 }}</ref> The Manchester-[[Nashua, New Hampshire|Nashua]] area is one of the 40 largest metropolitan areas in the United States without Amtrak service.<ref>[[List of major cities in U.S. lacking Amtrak service|List of major cities in US lacking Amtrak service - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia]]. En.wikipedia.org. Retrieved on August 2, 2013.</ref>

With the expansion of [[Interstate 93]] to eight lanes from [[Salem, New Hampshire|Salem]] to Manchester under construction, space is being reserved in the median for potential future commuter or light rail service along this corridor.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rebuildingi93.com/content/faq/|title=Rebuilding I93: Salem to Manchester (NHDOT)—Frequently Asked Questions (F.A.Q.)|first=CHA for New Hampshire Department of|last=Transportation|publisher=}}</ref> The I-93 transit study also suggested restoring service on the Manchester and Lawrence branch for commuter and freight rail.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nh.gov/dot/org/aerorailtransit/railandtransit/documents/nhstaterailplan.pdf |title=Rail plan|website=nh.gov}}</ref> This corridor would support freight rail along with commuter, something that light rail cannot do.

In late 2011, [[Dean Kamen]], inventor of the [[Segway PT|Segway]] and owner of several buildings in the Millyard, as well as co-founder of [[FIRST]], proposed a rail loop for downtown and the Millyard. Several meetings have been held with area business and property owners, city officials and local developers, but the idea is in the early conceptual stages.<ref>[http://livablemht.org/2012/01/17/livable-dean-kamen-proposes-downtown-rail-loop/ Livable: Dean Kamen proposes downtown rail loop]. LivableMHT (January 17, 2012). Retrieved on August 2, 2013.</ref>

The downtown rail loop, if approved by the Board of Mayor and Aldermen, would be about three miles long. The loop would go from the Manchester Millyards, down south for about half a mile, then turn over Elm Street, separate into two rails (the other going towards [[Manchester-Boston Regional Airport]]), and climb north to Bridge Street, ending at the Brady Sullivan Tower at the northern end of Elm Street.

===Public safety===

====Law enforcement====
Law enforcement is provided by the Manchester Police Department. The Manchester police station is at 405 Valley Street on the corner of Valley and Maple.

The Hillsborough County Department of Corrections is at 445 Willow Street. The prison houses an average of 500 inmates.

====Fire department====
The city of Manchester is protected all year by the 200 paid, professional firefighters (IAFF Local 856) of the City of Manchester Fire Department. The department is commanded by a Chief of Department, Daniel Goonan, one Assistant Chief, and five District Chiefs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.manchesternh.gov/Departments/Fire/tabid/176/Default.aspx|title=Fire Department|first=City of Manchester NH Official Web|last=Site|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.manchesternh.gov/fire/OrgChart.pdf |title=Organization Chart |website=manchesternh.gov}}</ref> The Manchester Fire Department operates out of ten fire stations throughout the city, and operates a fire apparatus fleet of ten engines, four ladder trucks (two staffed/two cross-manned by the engine), one rescue, and one district chief (two if manpower permits). The Manchester Fire Department responds to over 26,000 emergency calls annually.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.manchesternh.gov/Departments/Fire/FireRoster/tabid/991/Default.aspx|title=Fire Roster|first=City of Manchester NH Official Web|last=Site|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.manchesternh.gov/Departments/Fire/FireStations/tabid/316/Default.aspx|title=Fire Stations|first=City of Manchester NH Official Web|last=Site|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.manchesternh.gov/Departments/Fire/DepartmentApparatus/tabid/317/Default.aspx|title=Department Apparatus|first=City of Manchester NH Official Web|last=Site|publisher=}}</ref>
