After Clinton denied having a relationship with Flowers on ''[[60 Minutes]]'', she held a [[press conference]] in which she played tape recordings she had secretly made of phone calls with Clinton.<ref name="Flo*^">{{cite news|url=http://www.rcfp.org/news/2002/1119flower.html |title=Gennifer Flowers may proceed with defamation suit |publisher=[[Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press]] |date=November 19, 2002 |accessdate=March 20, 2008 |quote=At the press conference, Flowers – who initially denied allegations that she had an affair with then Arkansas governor Bill Clinton but then changed her story – played tapes of conversations she had secretly recorded between herself and Clinton |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071209092553/http://www.rcfp.org/news/2002/1119flower.html |archivedate=December 9, 2007 |df=mdy }}</ref> Clinton subsequently apologized publicly to [[Mario Cuomo]] for remarks he made about the then-[[Governor of New York]] on the tapes, in which he had said that Cuomo acted like a [[Italian-American Mafia|mafioso]]. During the press conference, Flowers was asked several questions by [[John Melendez|"Stuttering John" Melendez]] of the ''[[Howard Stern Show]]'' if she was planning to sleep with any other candidates before the election, if Clinton used a [[condom]] and if there ever was a [[threesome]].

In December 1996, Flowers talked about her sexual relationship with Clinton on ''[[The Richard Bey Show]]''. The show was canceled the following day.

In a deposition in January 1998, while denying [[Kathleen Willey]]'s sexual accusations against him, Clinton admitted that he had a sexual encounter with Flowers.<ref name="rp.x"/>  In his 2004 autobiography ''[[My Life (Bill Clinton autobiography)|My Life]]'', Clinton acknowledged testifying under oath that he had a sexual encounter with Flowers.

Flowers sued Stephanopoulos, Carville and others in 1999 for [[defamation]] (later amending the suit in 2000 to include Hillary Clinton as a defendant), claiming that they orchestrated a campaign to discredit her.
