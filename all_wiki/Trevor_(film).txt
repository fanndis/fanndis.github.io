==Plot==
Trevor focuses on its namesake character Trevor, who is a quirky and outgoing homosexual 13-year-old child and who develops a crush on a boy at his school. Trevor is a fan of singer Diana Ross and wants to dress up as her for Halloween. He also enjoys acting and dancing in school plays. Because of these different interests, Trevor faces discrimination from both his parents and his friends; his parents often try to ignore the fact their son is different and his friends bully him countless times throughout the school day. Trevor also attends counselling sessions with his parents' priest. Trevor tries to take his life by overdosing on aspirin in his room while listening to Diana Ross, commenting "Everybody at school thinks I'm a gay. It must be showing." His suicide attempt was unsuccessful and as a result Trevor finds a new friend in a nurse who tended to him.<ref>{{Citation|title=Trevor Film|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO5uKgTETSI|language=en|access-date=March 22, 2020}}</ref>
