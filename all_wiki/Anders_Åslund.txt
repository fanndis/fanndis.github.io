'''Per Anders Åslund''' ({{IPA-sv|ˈânːdɛʂ oːslɵnd}};{{fix|text=tones?|date=February 2018}} born 17 February 1952) is a [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[economist]] and a Senior Fellow at the [[Atlantic Council]]. He is also a chairman of the International Advisory Council at the Center for Social and Economic Research (CASE).

His work focuses on [[Transition economy|economic transition]] from centrally planned to [[market economy|market economies]]. Åslund served as an economic adviser to the governments of [[Kyrgyzstan]], [[Russia]], and [[Ukraine]] and from 2003 was director of  the Russian and Eurasian Program at the [[Carnegie Endowment for International Peace]]. Åslund was an advocate of early, comprehensive, and radical economic reforms in Russia and Eastern Europe.<ref>Anders Åslund, Post-Communist Economic Revolutions: How Big a Bang? The Center for Strategic and International Studies, Washington, DC, and Westview, 1992, pp. 106</ref>  He worked at the [[Peterson Institute for International Economics]] from 2006 to 2015. In 2013, [[David Frum]] wrote that “Anders Aslund at the Peterson Institute is one of the world’s leading experts on the collapse of the [[Planned economy of the Soviet Union|planned Soviet economy]].” <ref>http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/04/04/what-the-eurozone-crisis-is-all-about.html</ref>

Anders Aslund lives permanently in Washington, DC, with his wife Anna and their two children.

==Åslund in Sweden==
From 1989 to 1994, Åslund worked as a Professor of International Economics at the [[Stockholm School of Economics]]; and in 1989 he became the founding director of the Stockholm Institute of East European Economics.

On 22 April 1990 Åslund published a controversial article in the leading Swedish daily, [[Dagens Nyheter]], drawing parallels between the collapsing communist regimes in Eastern Europe and the social democratic policies in Sweden.<ref>Anders Åslund, "Storstäda i Sverige! (Clean up in Sweden!)", Dagens Nyheter, April 22, 1990</ref>  He argued that Sweden had too large a public sector; supported communist dictatorships, such as Cuba, in the Third World; and had excessive state intervention in all areas of life. The ruling Social Democratic government opposed the views of Åslund in dozens of articles. In June 1990, Social Democratic Prime Minister [[Ingvar Carlsson]] voiced public disagreement with Åslund in the Swedish parliament.<ref>http://data.riksdagen.se/dokument/gd09139/html</ref><ref name="riksdagen">http://www.riksdagen≠.se/sv/Dokument-Lagar/Kammaren/Protokoll/Riksdagens-snabbprotokoll-1990_GE09131/{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> However, opposition leader, [[Carl Bildt]], defended Åslund.<ref name="riksdagen" /><ref>Anders Åslund, "Statsministern och verkligheten (The Prime Minister and the Reality)", Svenska Dagbladet, July 3, 1990.</ref>

==Involvement in Russian economic reform==
From November 1991 to January 1994, Åslund worked with [[Jeffrey Sachs]] and David Lipton as a senior advisor to the Russian reform government under President [[Boris Yeltsin]] and Acting Prime Minister [[Yegor Gaidar]].<ref>Nelson, Lynn D. and Irina Y. Kuzes, 1994, Property to the People: The Struggle for Radical Economic Reform in Russia. M.E. Sharp, New York.</ref> He worked also with Deputy Prime Ministers Anatoly Chubais and Boris Fedorov. Åslund summarized his views in his book How Russia Became a Market Economy.<ref>Anders Åslund, How Russia Became a Market Economy, Washington, DC: Brookings 1995.</ref>

==Other Work==
After his experiences in Russia, Åslund worked as an economic advisor to President [[Leonid Kuchma]] of Ukraine from 1994 to 1997, and from 1998 to 2004, to President [[Askar Akaev]] of Kyrgyzstan. Åslund has also worked substantially with economic policy in the [[Baltic countries]], first as a member of the International Baltic Economic Commission from 1991 to 1993,<ref>Anders Åslund, How Capitalism Was Built, Second Edition, New York: Cambridge University Press, 2012.</ref> and later as an informal advisor to Latvian Prime Minister [[Valdis Dombrovskis]] from 2009.<ref>Anders Åslund and Valdis Dombrovskis, How Latvia Came through the Financial Crisis, Washington, DC: Peterson Institute for International Economics.</ref> (Dombrovskis was prime minister until 2014.)

In 2016, Åslund was appointed to the supervisory board of Ukraine's 23rd largest bank, Kredyt Dnipro, owned by Ukrainian billionaire [[Viktor Pinchuk]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.finance.ua/ru/news/-/368688/eks-glava-mvf-voshel-v-nabsovet-banka-pinchuka|title=Экс-глава МВФ вошел в набсовет банка Пинчука|website=News.finance.ua|access-date=February 3, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Rachkevych|first=Mark|url=https://www.kyivpost.com/article/content/business/billionaire-pinchuk-puts-strauss-kahn-other-big-names-on-bank-board-407227.html|title=Billionaire Pinchuk puts Strauss-Kahn, other big names on bank board|newspaper=Kyiv Post|date=February 3, 2016|access-date=February 6, 2019}}</ref>

Åslund was a member of the supervisory board of the [[Ukrainian Railways]] from June 2018 until September 2020.<ref name="epravda665701">{{in lang|uk}} [https://www.epravda.com.ua/news/2020/09/29/665701/ Zelensky commented on the resignation of UZ Aslund, a member of the supervisory board], [[Ukrayinska Pravda]] (29 September 2020)</ref> He claimed he resigned because [[Ukrainian President]] [[Volodymyr Zelensky]] and [[People's Deputy of Ukraine|members of the Ukrainian parliament]] "do not believe in good corporate governance."<ref name="epravda665701"/> Åslund claimed that the foreign members of the supervisory boards of 13 large state-owned companies "receive only insults and obstacles from the president."<ref name="epravda665701"/>
