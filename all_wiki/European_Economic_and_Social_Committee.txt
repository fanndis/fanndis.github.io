{{Politics of the European Union}}

The '''European Economic and Social Committee''' ('''EESC''') is a consultative [[body of the European Union]] (EU) established in 1958. It is an advisory assembly composed of "social partners", namely: employers ([[employers' organization|employers' organisations]]), employees ([[trade union]]s) and representatives of various other interests. Its seat, which it shares with the [[Committee of the Regions]], is the [[Delors building|Jacques Delors building]] on Belliardstraat / Rue Belliard 99 in [[Brussels]].  Once known by the acronym "EcoSoc", the body is now referred to as the "EESC", to avoid confusions with the [[United Nations]] [[United Nations Economic and Social Council|ECOSOC]].

==Role==
The European Economic and Social Committee was established by the [[Treaty of Rome]] of 1957 in order to unite different economic [[interest group]]s to establish a [[European Community|Single Market]]. The creation of this committee gave them an institution to allow their voices to be heard by the [[European Commission]], the [[Council of the European Union|Council]] and the [[European Parliament]]. The EESC declares itself to be "a bridge between Europe and organised civil society".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.eesc.europa.eu/en/eesc-figures/secretary-general|title=Secretary-General - European Economic and Social Committee|work=European Economic and Social Committee}}</ref>

It is mandatory for the committee to be consulted on those issues stipulated in the Treaties and in all cases where the institutions deem it appropriate. The [[Treaty of Maastricht]] considerably enlarged the committee's domain. Its influence now extends to matters such as social policy, social and economic cohesion, environment, education, health, customers protection, industry, [[Trans-European Networks]], indirect taxation and structural funds. On certain issues the EESC works in partnership with the [[Committee of the Regions]].

In latest years the committee has taken up the challenge of civil society, opening up its forum to representatives of all sectors, developing two complementary missions:
* Involving civil society organisations more in the European venture, at both national and European level,
* Boosting the role of civil society organisations in non-member countries or country groupings where the committee is furthering structured dialogue with civil society organisations, and promoting the creation of consultative structures based on its experiences, not least in the countries applying for EU membership, the Mediterranean partner countries, African, Caribbean and Pacific countries, India, China, Latin America ([[Mercosur]]) and Brazil.

==Operation==
It is mandatory for the committee to be consulted on those issues stipulated in the Treaties and in all cases where the institutions deem it appropriate. The EESC may also be consulted on an exploratory basis by one of the other institutions, and may issue opinions on its own initiative (around 15% of its opinions are own-initiative opinions).

Own-initiative and exploratory opinions often raise the awareness of decision-making bodies, and of the commission in particular, about subjects which have hitherto barely attracted their attention, if at all. Exploratory opinions drawn up at the request of other institutions before the commission has even drafted its proposals enable the various components of organised civil society represented within the EESC to express the expectations, concerns and needs of grassroots stakeholders.

The Committee adopts on average 170 opinions a year on a wide range of subjects concerning European integration. It therefore plays an active role in the processes of shaping Community policies and preparing Community decisions.

==Membership==

Currently, EESC membership numbers 329 (same as the [[Committee of the Regions]]).<ref>[https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32019D0853]</ref> The number of members per EU state varies according to the population of each state (see table below for state-by-state membership figures; the breakdown is the same for the Committee of the Regions). Members of the EESC are divided into three groups of equal number, employers, employees and a third group of various other changing interests such as: farmers, consumer groups, professional associations and so on.

Members are appointed by the council (by qualified majority) following nominations made by the government of the respective [[Member State of the European Union|Member State]]. However, once appointed, the members are completely independent of their governments. They have a renewable term of office of five years. The President of the EESC, elected for a {{frac|2|1|2}}-year term, is [https://www.eesc.europa.eu/en/about/political-organisation/eesc-president/bio] Christa Schweng (since 28 October 2020),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.eesc.europa.eu/en/about/political-organisation/eesc-president/bio|title=The President - EESC|accessdate=2018-05-17}}</ref> and the previous presidents were [[Luca Jahier|Luca Jahier]] (2018-2020) [[:fr:Georges Dassis|Georges Dassis]] (2015-2018) and [[Henri Malosse]] (2013-2015).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.eesc.europa.eu/en/about/political-organisation/former-eesc-presidents|title=Former EESC Presidents|accessdate=2018-05-17}}</ref>

==Critique of the EESC==

In a report reviewing 50 years of the EESC,<ref>The European Economic and Social Committee 50 years of participatory democracy, C.S. Dimitrioulas Scientific Direction, European Economic and Social Committee Brussels 2008</ref> C.S. Dimitrioulas cited [[Jacques Delors]] as saying that EESC contributions from 1958 to 2008 on civil and social matters were "remarkable". Dimitrioulas commented: "Thanks to its membership and unique role in the EU’s institutional framework, the Committee will in future have special responsibility for making a reality of [[participatory democracy]] and for working towards the development of structured dialogue between organised civil society and Union institutions."

In 2012, the [[European Foundation (think tank)|European Foundation]] stated that while the EESC has undoubtedly performed good works in its time, it had outlived its usefulness and should be dismantled.<ref name="theeuropeanjournal">{{cite web|url=http://www.europeanfoundation.org/the-eesc-and-cor-should-be-abolished/|title=The EESC and COR should be abolished|author=The European Journal|work=europeanfoundation.org}}</ref> The modern EU is replete with advisors: Commissioners have their DGs, MEPs have their own researchers, and the ''ad hoc'' national ministers attending the Council of Ministers have both their own advisors and the services of [[COREPER]]. The vice president of the European Conservatives and Reformists group in the European Parliament, Derk Jan Eppink, also stated in 2012, "Over the last eight years, the budgets of the EESC and CoR will have increased by some 50 percent, reaching €130 million and €86.5 million, respectively.  There are around 50 officials at each committee with a minimum salary of €123,890, and six officials at each committee earning over €180,000 " He stated that there is no information on whether or how the COR and the EESC opinions had influenced legislation, adding that neither Committee had been successful in fulfilling its mandate to "engage participation" from citizens.<ref name="theeuropeanjournal"/>

The EESC has fought such criticism with arguments of its own.  [[:sv:Staffan Nilsson (lantbrukare)|Staffan Nilsson]] (then EESC president) said "It's very strange that Liberals, who also ask for transparency and for the development of society, would try to discuss the idea of cancelling the only body that is for people who are not politicians."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.euractiv.com/future-eu/eu-advisory-committee-defends-role-critics-news-501390|title=EU advisory committee defends its role against critics|work=EurActiv - EU News & policy debates, across languages}}</ref>

Far from being sidelined as critics hoped, the EESC was reinvigorated by the [[Lisbon Treaty]], which has confirmed the EESC's role and influence. According to proponents of the EESC: "Indeed, significant prospects for the development of participatory democracy are opened through Article 11 of the new Treaty on the European Union, which lays the foundations for the future establishment of a genuine structured civil dialogue at European level alongside the political dialogue between the EU and its Member States and the [[social dialogue]] with the social partners, thereby ensuring sustainable participation of organised civil society in the European political process. In this context, the EESC has a particular responsibility in bringing participatory democracy to life. In view of its membership and role, as laid down in the Treaties, and in partnership with the other institutions, the Committee's purpose is to be even more in the future the means of developing participatory democracy and civil dialogue at Union level."{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

In October 2020 reappointment of a Polish business representative Jacek Krawczyk for another five-year term of the EESC president became a target of harsh criticism as the EESC faced pressure to better prevent harassment in the organization. Mr. Krawczyk was himself accused of psychological harassment and is prosecuted by Belgian authorities. <ref>{{cite news |last1=VON DER BURCHARD |first1=HANS |title=‘Zombie committee’ member accused of harassment to be reappointed |url=https://www.politico.eu/article/jacek-krawczyk-eesc-zombie-committee-accused-harassment-reappointed/?fbclid=IwAR1iIwKL8bYagE322gCCQh4ky42aeF34BuulOtZW8pZ-iolUGuvLll8VArg |accessdate=30 October 2020}}</ref>  Besides that, the conduct of Jacek Krawczyk has been investigated by the EU’s anti-fraud office OLAF.<ref>{{cite news |last1=VON DER BURCHARD |first1=HANS |title= The EU’s €140M ‘zombie committee’ faces pressure to reform|url=https://www.politico.eu/article/the-eu-zombie-committee/?fbclid=IwAR3q1ZBqmV2R7Hwjj1D6iwQRkALPCMq7uZhrw8JAZRbhjbTzrDIWUu7MIrA# |accessdate=30 October 2020}}</ref>  MEPs  therefore rejected the EESC’s 2018 financial accounts over its failure to deal with the issue of harassment.  According to the words of  MEP [[Tomáš Zdechovský]], who led the budget discharge procedure, the EESC was not able to answer questions regarding its various mistakes and take measures which would make MEPs believe that this particular institution is able to protect the interests of European citizens.<ref>{{cite news |last1=VON DER BURCHARD |first1=HANS |title=Parliament rejects accounts of troubled EU social committee |url=https://www.politico.eu/article/meps-decline-to-clear-accounts-of-troubled-eu-social-committee/}}</ref> 

Overall usefulness of the EESC has also been questioned recently. While the number of administrative staff has decreased from 727 in 2013 to 668 in 2019 and the number of opinions has gone down, the annual EESC's budget has continued to grow.<ref>{{cite news |last1=VON DER BURCHARD |first1=HANS |title=The EU’s €140M ‘zombie committee’ faces pressure to reform |url=https://www.politico.eu/article/the-eu-zombie-committee/?fbclid=IwAR3q1ZBqmV2R7Hwjj1D6iwQRkALPCMq7uZhrw8JAZRbhjbTzrDIWUu7MIrA# |accessdate=30 October 2020 |date=October 28, 2020}}</ref> Czech MEP [[Tomáš Zdechovský]] said, that  “very few lawmakers are reading the opinions of this committee. The impact is close to zero.” He also described the EESC as “a zombie committee that lost its purpose but still lives on.”<ref>{{cite news |last1=VON DER BURCHARD |first1=HANS |title=The EU’s €140M ‘zombie committee’ faces pressure to reform |url=https://www.politico.eu/article/the-eu-zombie-committee/?fbclid=IwAR3q1ZBqmV2R7Hwjj1D6iwQRkALPCMq7uZhrw8JAZRbhjbTzrDIWUu7MIrA# |accessdate=30 October 2020 |date=October 28, 2020}}</ref>
