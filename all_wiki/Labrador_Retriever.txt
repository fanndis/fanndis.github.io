The '''Labrador Retriever''', often abbreviated to '''Labrador''', is a [[Dog breed|breed]] of [[retriever]]-[[gun dog]] from the [[United Kingdom]] that was developed from imported [[Canada|Canadian]] fishing dogs. The Labrador is one of the most popular dog breeds in a number of countries in the world, particularly in the western world.

A favourite [[Assistance dog|disability assistance]] breed in many countries, Labradors are frequently trained to aid those with [[Visual impairment|blindness]] or [[autism]], act as a therapy dog, or perform screening and detection work for law enforcement and other official agencies.<ref name="stats">{{cite web|url=http://www.akc.org/reg/dogreg_stats.cfm |title=AKC Dog Registration Statistics |publisher=Akc.org |date=4 April 2012 |access-date=9 April 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120511200854/http://www.akc.org/reg/dogreg_stats.cfm |archive-date=11 May 2012  }}</ref> The breed is best known for their obedience, loyalty, and playful composure.

==Origin and lineage==
[[File:Buccleuch Avon (1885).png|thumb|[[Buccleuch Avon]] (b. 1885)]]

The Labrador breed dates back to at least the 1830s, when St. Johns Water Dogs bred by settlers in [[Newfoundland]] were first introduced to Britain from ships trading between the Canada and [[Poole]] in [[Dorsetshire]]. These were then bred with British hunting dogs to create what become known as the Labrador Retriever. Its early patrons included the [[Earl of Malmesbury]], the [[Duke of Buccleuch]], the [[Earl of Home]], and [[Sir John Scott]]. Early writers have confused the Labrador with the much larger [[Newfoundland (dog)|Newfoundland]] and the [[Lesser Newfoundland]], with [[Charles William George St John|Charles St. John]] even referring to the Lesser Newfoundland as the Newfoundland. Colonel [[Peter Hawker]] describes the first Labrador as being not larger than an [[Pointer (dog breed)|English Pointer]], more often black than other colours, long in its head and nose with a deep chest, fine legs, short and smooth coat, and did not carry its tail as highly as the Newfoundland.<ref name=Drury1903>{{cite book|last1=Holland-Hibert|first1=A.|title=British dogs, their points, selection, and show preparation|editor1-last=Drury|editor1-first=William D.|publisher=Upcot Gill|edition=3|year=1903|chapter=Ch.XXX - The Labrador|pages=356–358|chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/britishdogstheir00drurrich/page/356}}</ref> Hawker distinguishes the Newfoundland from both the "proper Labrador" and [[St. John's water dog|St. John's]] breed of these dogs<ref name=Drury1903/><ref name=Hawker1846/> in the fifth edition of his book ''Introductions to Young Sportsman'' published in 1846.<ref name=Hawker1846>{{cite book|last1=Hawker|first1=Peter|title=Introductions to Young Sportsman in all that relates to Guns and Shooting|publisher=Longman, Hurst, Rees, Orme, Brown, and Green|edition=5|year=1846|chapter=Dogs|pages=245|chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/instructionstoy02hawkgoog/page/n269}}</ref>

===Appearance===

Labradors are a medium-large breed, with males typically weighing {{convert|65|-|80|lb|kg|abbr=on|disp=flip|0}} and females {{convert|55|-|70|lb|kg|abbr=on|disp=flip|0}}.<ref name="akc">{{cite web

  | date =31 March 1994
| url =http://www.akc.org/breeds/labrador_retriever/index.cfm
  | access-date = 13 September 2007}}</ref> The majority of the characteristics of this breed, with the exception of colour, are the result of breeding to produce a [[Retriever|working retriever]].

As with some other breeds, the Conformation (typically "Show", "English" or "bench") and the Field (typically "Working" or "American") lines differ, although both lines are bred in both countries and the origins of both are from British lines. In general, however, Conformation Labradors tend to be bred as medium-sized dogs, shorter and stockier with fuller faces and a slightly calmer nature than their Field counterparts, which are often bred as taller, lighter-framed dogs, with slightly less broad faces and a slightly longer nose. However, Field Labradors should still be proportional and fit within [[American Kennel Club]] standards. With Field Labradors, excessively long noses, thin heads, long legs, and lanky frames are not considered standard. These two types are informal and not codified or standardised; no distinction is made by the AKC or other kennel clubs, but the two types come from different breeding lines. Australian stock also exists; though not seen in the West, they are common in Asia. These dogs are also very good with children.

The breed tends to [[Moult|shed]] hair twice annually or regularly throughout the year in [[temperate climate]]s.<ref name="pslra"/> Some Labradors shed considerably; however, individual Labradors vary.<ref name="animalforum">"[http://www.animalforum.com/dbreed/splabrador.htm Sporting breeds: Labrador Retriever]." ''[http://www.animalforum.com/ animalforum.com].'' (c) 1998–2007. Retrieved on 17 September 2007.</ref> Labrador hair is usually short and straight, and the tail is quite broad and strong. The [[webbed toes]] of the Labrador Retriever make them excellent swimmers. The webbing between their toes can also serve as a "snowshoe" in colder climates and keep snow from balling up between their toes—a condition that can be painful to other breeds with hair between the toes. Their interwoven coat is also relatively waterproof, providing more assistance for swimming.

====Official Breed Standards====
There is a great deal of variety among Labradors. The following characteristics are typical of the [[conformation show]] bred (bench-bred) lines of this breed in the United States and are based on the American Kennel Club standard.<ref name="akc"/> Significant differences between U.K. and U.S. standards are noted.
* '''Size''': Labradors are a medium-large breed. They should be as long from the [[withers]] to the base of the tail as they are from the floor to the withers. The AKC standard includes an ideal weight for males of {{convert|65|-|80|lb|kg|abbr=on|disp=flip|0}} and for females as {{convert|55|-|70|lb|kg|abbr=on|disp=flip|0}}.<ref name="akc" /> The guidelines for height vary between the AKC, which gives {{convert|22.5|to|24.5|in|cm|disp=flip|0}} for males and {{convert|21.5|to|23.5|in|cm|disp=flip|0}} for females,<ref name="akc" /> [[The Kennel Club]] which advises that males should be {{convert|56|to|57|cm|in|round=0.5}} with females between {{convert|55|to|56|cm|in|round=0.5}},<ref name="kc">[http://www.thekennelclub.org.uk/item/109 Retriever (Labrador) Breed Standard] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111031032613/http://www.thekennelclub.org.uk/item/109 |date=31 October 2011 }}. The Kennel Club.</ref> and the FCI which quotes a range of {{convert|56|to|57|cm|in|round=0.5}} for males with females ideal at {{convert|54|to|56|cm|in|round=0.5}}.<ref name=fci>[http://www.fci.be/Nomenclature/Standards/122g08-en.pdf Labrador Retriever]. Fédération Cynologique Internationale. Accessed May 2020.</ref>
* '''Coat''': The Labrador Retriever's coat should be short and dense, but not wiry. The coat is water-resistant, so the dog does not get cold when taking to water in the winter. That means that the dog naturally has a slightly dry, oily coat. Acceptable colours are black, yellow, and chocolate.<ref name="akc.org">[http://www.akc.org/breeds/labrador_retriever/index.cfm "Get to Know the Labrador Retriever"], 'The American Kennel Club', Retrieved 29 May 2014</ref>
* '''Head''': The head should be broad with slightly pronounced eyebrows. The eyes should be kind and expressive. Appropriate eye colours are brown and hazel. The lining around the eyes should be black. The ears should hang close to the head and set slightly above the eyes.
* '''Jaws''': The jaws should be strong and powerful. The muzzle should be of medium length and should not be too tapered. The jaws should hang slightly and curve gracefully back.
* '''Body''': The body should have a powerful and muscular build.

The tail and coat are designated "distinctive [or distinguishing] features" of the Labrador by both the Kennel Club and AKC.<ref name="akc"/><ref name="kc" /> The AKC adds that "true Labrador Retriever temperament is as much a hallmark of the breed as the 'otter' tail."<ref name="akc" />

{{Main|Labrador Retriever coat colour genetics}}
[[File:3labradorcols.jpg|thumb|alt=three Labrador Retrievers: white, black and chocolate|The three primary colour varieties of the Labrador Retriever]]

Labrador Retrievers are registered in three colours:<ref name="akc"/> black (a solid black colour), yellow (considered from creamy white to fox-red), and chocolate (medium to dark brown and originally called “Liver”). Some dogs are sold as silver purebred Labradors, but purity of those bloodlines is currently disputed by breed experts, including breed clubs and breed councils. Although it has not been conclusively proven that the silver Labrador is a product of crossbreeding a [[Weimaraner]] to a Labrador, there is good evidence in scientific literature indicating that the Labrador has never been identified as carrying the dilute gene dd. The Weimaraner is the only known breed in which the universality of dd is a characteristic.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nationallabradorretrieverbreedcouncilaustralia.com/buyer-beware.asp |title=Buyer beware |publisher=National Labrador Retriever Breed Council, Australia |access-date=10 January 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Cathy Lambert|title=Getting to Know Labradors: A Guide to Choosing and Owning a Labrador Retriever|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eK7GbIeky3oC&pg=PA13|publisher=Animalinfo Publications|isbn=978-1-921537-04-2 |p=13}}</ref> A few major kennel clubs around the world allow silver Labradors to be registered, but not as silver because the only colours for Labrador Retrievers are black, yellow or chocolate on the registration applications. The Kennel Club (England) requires that they be registered as "Non-recognised."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thekennelclub.org.uk/services/public/breed/colours.aspx?id=2048|title=The Kennel Club|publisher=The Kennel Club|access-date=10 January 2015}}</ref> Many kennel clubs now require DNA testing to prove that the Labrador is purebred and does not carry dilution.
Occasionally, Labradors will exhibit small amounts of white fur on their chest, paws, or tail, and rarely a purebred Labrador will exhibit brindling stripes or tan points similar to a [[Rottweiler]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://labradornet.com/brindletanpoint.html |title=The Genetics of Brindle And Tan Point Labrador Retrievers |publisher=Labradornet |access-date=9 April 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120508031039/http://labradornet.com/brindletanpoint.html |archive-date=8 May 2012  }}</ref> These markings are a disqualification for show dogs, but do not have any bearing on the dog's temperament or ability to be a good working dog or pet.

[[Puppy|Puppies]] of all colours can potentially occur in the same [[Litter (animal)|litter]]. Colour is determined primarily by three genes. The first gene (the B locus) determines the density of the coat's eumelanin pigment granules, if that pigment is allowed: dense granules result in a black coat, sparse ones give a chocolate coat. The second (E) locus determines whether the eumelanin is produced at all. A dog with the recessive e allele will produce only phaeomelanin pigment and will be yellow regardless of its genotype at the B locus. The genes known about previously<ref>{{cite web

Yellow Labradors are determined at the E locus, so the K locus is irrelevant in determining their colour. Variations in numerous other genes control the subtler details of the coat's colouration, which in yellow Labradors varies from creamy white to fox-red. Chocolate and black Labradors' noses will match the coat colour.

According to a 2011 study, 13 out of 245 Labradors studied were [[heterozygous]] for the M264V mutation responsible for the [[melanistic mask]], and one was [[homozygous]]. Within the breed, this trait is not visible.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.rvsc.2011.02.002 |title=Incidence of the mask phenotype M264V mutation in Labrador Retrievers |year=2011 |last1=Conant |first1=E.K. |last2=Juras |first2=R. |last3=Cothran |first3=E.G. |journal=Research in Veterinary Science |volume=91 |issue=3 |pages=e98–9 |pmid=21353269}}</ref>

=====Nose and Skin Pigmentation=====
[[File:ChocolateLabPup.jpg|thumb|The most common places where pigmentation is visible are the nose, lips, gums, and the rims of the eyes]]
Labrador colouration is controlled by multiple [[gene]]s. It is possible for [[recessive]] genes to re-emerge in later generations. Also, there can sometimes be unexpected [[pigmentation]] effects to different parts of the body. Pigmentation effects appear in regard to yellow Labradors, and sometimes chocolate, and hence the majority of this section covers pigmentation within the yellow Labrador. The most common places where pigmentation is visible are the nose, lips, gums, feet, tail, and the rims of the eyes, which may be black, brown, light yellow-brown ("liver", caused by having two genes for chocolate),<ref name="woodhaven_pigmentation">{{cite web

}}</ref> or several other colours. A Labrador can carry genes for a different colour; for example, a black Labrador can carry recessive chocolate and yellow genes, and a yellow Labrador can carry recessive genes for the other two colours. [[DNA testing]] can reveal some aspects of these. Less common pigmentations (other than pink) are a fault, not a disqualification, and hence such dogs are still permitted to be shown.<ref name="woodhaven_pigmentation" />

The intensity of black pigment on yellow Labradors is controlled by a separate gene independent of the fur colouring.<ref name="woodhaven_pigmentation"/> Yellow Labradors usually have black noses, which may gradually turn pink with age (called "snow nose" or "winter nose"). This is due to a reduction in the [[enzyme]] [[tyrosinase]] which indirectly controls the production of [[melanin]], a dark colouring. Tyrosinase is temperature dependent—hence light colouration can be seasonal, due to cold weather—and is less produced with increasing age from 2 years old onwards. As a result, the nose colour of most yellow Labradors becomes a somewhat pink shade as they grow older.<ref name="woodhaven_pigmentation" />

A colouration known as "Dudley" is also possible. Dudleys are variously defined as yellow Labradors which have unpigmented (pink) noses (LRC), yellow with liver/chocolate pigmentation (AKC), or "flesh coloured" in addition to having the same colour around the rims of the eye, rather than having black or dark brown pigmentation.<ref name="pslra" /><ref name="woodhaven_pigmentation" /> A yellow Labrador with brown or chocolate pigmentation, for example, a brown or chocolate nose, is not necessarily a Dudley, though according to the AKC's current standard it would be if it has chocolate rims around the eyes (or more accurately of the genotype eebb). Breed standards for Labradors considers a true Dudley to be a disqualifying feature in a conformation show Lab, such as one with a thoroughly pink nose or one lacking in any pigment along with flesh coloured rims around the eyes. True Dudleys are extremely rare.<ref name="woodhaven_pigmentation" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.canadasguidetodogs.com/labrador/labarticle6.htm |title=Labrador Retriever Breed Standards Comparison Chart |publisher=Canada's Guide to Dogs Website |date=14 March 2006 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110926232820/http://www.canadasguidetodogs.com/labrador/labarticle6.htm |archive-date=26 September 2011 }}</ref>
Breeding in order to correct pigmentation often lacks dependability. Because colour is determined by many genes, some of which are recessive, crossbreeding a pigmentation non-standard yellow Labrador to a black Labrador may not correct the matter or prevent future generations carrying the same recessive genes. For similar reasons, crossbreeding chocolate to yellow Labradors is also often avoided.

====Show and field lines====
[[File:American and English Labrador heads.jpg|thumb|left|Head and [[Snout|muzzle]] appearance: field (left), and show (right), showing the shorter muzzle length, more solid appearance head, and "pronounced" stop of the latter]]
As a result of specialised breeding there are significant differences between field and trial-bred and show-bred lines of Labradors. In the United States, the former are sometimes mistakenly referred to as "American" and the latter as "English", in fact both field and show types are bred in both countries and all Labrador Retrievers are descended from British lines.<ref>{{cite web|last=American Kennel Club|first=The Labrador Retriever Club, Inc.|title=American vs. English|url=http://www.thelabradorclub.com/subpages/show_contents.php?page=English+vs.+American|access-date=2 September 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170705101113/http://www.thelabradorclub.com/subpages/show_contents.php?page=English+vs.+American|archive-date=5 July 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> In the United Kingdom, they are called "Field" and "Show". Dogs bred for hunting and field-trial work are selected first for working ability, where dogs bred to compete in [[conformation show]]s are selected for their conformation to the standards and characteristics sought by judges in the show ring.

While individual dogs may vary, in general show-bred Labradors are heavier built, slightly shorter-bodied, and have a thicker coat and tail. Field Labradors are generally longer-legged, lighter, and more lithe in build, making them agile. In the head, show Labradors tend to have broader heads, better defined stops, and more powerful necks, while field Labradors have lighter and slightly narrower heads with longer muzzles.<ref name="labbies-hist">{{cite web|last=Davol|first=Pamela A.|title=THE LABRADOR RETRIEVER|url=http://www.labbies.com/history.htm|work=Wing-N-Wave Labradors|access-date=13 September 2007}}</ref><ref name="woodhaven">{{cite web

In the United States, the American Kennel Club (AKC) and the Labrador's breed club have set the breed standard to accommodate the field-bred Labrador somewhat. For instance, the AKC withers-height standards allow conformation dogs to be slightly taller than the equivalent British standard.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thelabradorclub.com/subpages/show_contents.php?page=Breed%20Standard|title=Breed Standard – The Labrador Retriever Club, Inc.|access-date=6 June 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080609065003/http://www.thelabradorclub.com/subpages/show_contents.php?page=Breed%20Standard|archive-date=9 June 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref> However, dual champions, or dogs that excel in both the field and the show ring, are becoming more unusual.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dog-training-talk.com/field-vs-show-what-s-the-difference-pa1-150.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070107182309/http://www.dog-training-talk.com/field-vs-show-what-s-the-difference-pa1-150.html |archive-date=7 January 2007 |title=Field vs. Show – What's the Difference? |first=Geoffrey A. |last=English |date=6 December 2006 |publisher=Dog-training-talk.com |access-date=9 April 2012}}</ref>

==Temperament==
[[File:Arson Dog Yancy.jpg|thumb|Labradors are known as intelligent and suitable for a variety of working roles, such as this dog trained to detect signs of [[arson]].]]
[[File:George Digweed's labrador.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Labradors are known to have a very soft feel to the mouth, and were bred to retrieve [[Game (hunting)|game]]]]
The AKC describes the Labrador's temperament as a kind, pleasant, outgoing and tractable nature.<ref name="akc.org"/> Labradors' sense of smell allows them to home<!-- Please do not change this to "hone in on". "hone in on" is not correct English. --> in on almost any scent and follow the path of its origin. They generally stay on the scent until they find it. Navies, military forces and police forces use them as detection dogs to track down smugglers, thieves, terrorists and black marketers. They are known to have a very soft feel to the mouth as a result of being bred to retrieve game such as waterfowl. They are prone to chewing objects (though they can be trained to abandon this behaviour).

Labradors have a reputation as a very even-tempered breed and an excellent family dog.<ref name="akc.org"/> This includes a good reputation with children of all ages and other animals.<ref name="pslra" /> Some lines, particularly those that have continued to be bred specifically for their skills at working in the field (rather than for their appearance), are particularly fast and athletic. Their fun-loving boisterousness and lack of fear may require training and intelligent handling at times to ensure it does not get out of hand—an uncontrolled adult can be quite problematic. Females may be slightly more independent than males.<ref name="pslra" /> Labradors mature at around three years of age; before this time they can have a significant degree of puppy-like energy, often mislabelled as being [[hyperactivity|hyperactive]].<ref name="pslra" /> Because of their enthusiasm, leash-training early on is suggested to prevent pulling when full-grown.<ref>{{cite web|last=Davis/Diamond|first=Kathy|title=Labrador Retriever Revelations|url=http://www.veterinarypartner.com/Content.plx?P=A&C=99&A=2244&S=0|access-date=13 September 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061022155106/http://www.veterinarypartner.com/Content.plx?P=A&C=99&A=2244&S=0|archive-date=22 October 2006}}</ref> Labradors often enjoy retrieving a ball endlessly (often obsessively) and other forms of activity (such as [[dog agility|agility]], [[frisbee]], or [[flyball]]).[[File:LabradorWeaving.jpg|thumb|A Labrador participating in [[dog agility]]]]Although they will sometimes [[bark (dog)|bark]] at noise, especially noise from an unseen source ("[[Bark (dog)#Alarm barking|alarm barking]]"), Labradors are usually not noisy<ref name="pslra" /> or [[territoriality|territorial]]. They are often very easygoing and trusting with strangers and therefore are not usually suitable as [[guard dog]]s.<ref name="pslra" />

Labradors as a breed are curious and exploratory and love company, following both people and interesting scents for food, attention, and novelty value. In this way, they can often "vanish" or otherwise become separated from their owners with little fanfare.<ref name="allaboutLabradors">"[http://www.all-about-labradors.com/idtags.html All About ID Tags]."

The steady temperament of Labradors and their ability to learn make them an ideal breed for search and rescue, detection, and therapy work. They are a very intelligent breed. They are ranked No. 7 in Stanley Coren's ''[[The Intelligence of Dogs]],'' making it one of the [[The Intelligence of Dogs (book)#Brightest Dogs|brightest dogs]] out of 138 breeds tested. The AKC describes the breed as an ideal family and sporting dog. Their primary working role in the field continues to be that of a hunting retriever.

Labrador Retrievers have proven to have a high success rate at becoming guide dogs. A study was recently done on how well four different breeds (Labrador Retriever, Golden Retriever, Labrador Retriever/Golden Retriever Mix, and German Shepherds) trained to become guide dogs. In this experiment, German Shepherds had the highest chance of not completing it. Labrador Retrievers and Labrador Retriever/Golden Retriever Mix had the highest success rate. However, German Shepherds and Golden Retrievers had a higher success rate after going through longer training than the training required for Labrador Retrievers.<ref>{{cite book|last=Serpell|first=James|title=The Domestic Dog: its Evolution, Behavior and Interactions With People|url=https://archive.org/details/domesticdogitsev00serp|url-access=registration|year=1995|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-41529-2}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jveb.2006.06.004 |title=Suitability for field service in 4 breeds of guide dogs |year=2006 |last1=Ennik |first1=Irma |last2=Liinamo |first2=Anna-Elisa |last3=Leighton |first3=Eldin |last4=Van Arendonk |first4=Johan |journal=Journal of Veterinary Behavior: Clinical Applications and Research |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=67–74}}</ref>

[[File:Max at the river2.jpg|thumb|Labradors are noted for their ability to tolerate cold water]]
Labradors are powerful and indefatigable swimmers noted for their ability to tolerate the coldest of water for extended periods of time. Their ability to work quietly alongside hunters while watching for birds to fall from the sky, marking where they land, and then using their outstanding nose to find and retrieve dead or wounded birds has made them the king of waterfowl retrievers.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Hunting Dog – Duck-Hunting Dogs|url=http://www.the-hunting-dog.com/duck-hunting-dogs.html|access-date=17 March 2011}}</ref>

It is a healthy breed with relatively few major problems. Notable issues related to health and well-being include inherited disorders and obesity (most are missing all or parts of the [[POMC]] gene).

A Royal Veterinary College study, and one conducted by The University of Sydney, have concluded that Chocolate Labradors have a shorter average life expectancy than other colours of Labrador (by about 10%) and are more likely to suffer some health problems.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rvc.ac.uk/vetcompass/news/chocolate-labradors-have-shorter-lifespan-than-rest-of-breed|title=Chocolate Labradors have shorter lifespan than rest of the breed|date=22 October 2018|website=VetCompassTM and the University of Sydney Study|publisher=Royal Veterinary College}}</ref> It is thought that this is due to breeder's attempts to increase their numbers through selective coat colour breeding at the expense of other important health traits. The brown coat colour is naturally rare (compared to yellow and black), and it has been fashionable since the 1980s. This has created a demand for larger numbers.

*  Out of all dog breeds it is the Labrador Retriever that is most likely to become obese. This obesity has been attributed to a specific gene mutation.<ref name="Freytas-tamura" /> See the Obesity subsection below.

===Obesity===
Labradors like to eat, and they can become obese without proper exercise. Laziness can contribute to this. Obesity is a serious condition and can be considered the number one nutritional problem with dogs. A study shows that at least 25% of dogs in the United States are overweight.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.justlabradors.com/health-and-nutrition/lean-labradors-live-longer |title=Lean Labradors Retrievers Live Longer – Obesity, the number one nutritional problem in dogs |publisher=Justlabradors.com |access-date=9 April 2012}}</ref> Therefore, Labradors must be properly exercised and stimulated. A healthy Labrador can do swimming wind sprints for two hours, and should keep a very slight hourglass waist and be fit and light, rather than fat or heavy-set. Obesity can exacerbate conditions such as hip dysplasia and joint problems, and can lead to secondary diseases. [[Osteoarthritis]] is very common in older, especially overweight, Labradors. A 14-year study covering 48 dogs by food manufacturer Purina showed that Labradors fed to maintain a lean body shape outlived those fed freely by around two years, emphasising the importance of not over-feeding. Labradors should be walked twice a day for at least half an hour.<ref name="Purina">{{cite web

===US military working dogs (war dogs): Labrador Retrievers in the Vietnam war===
[[File:Iraq dog.jpg|thumb|Labradors were selected by the military for tracking because of their distinct [[olfactory]] qualities. ]]

The [[Vietnam War]] is the only war in American history in which US [[war dogs]], which were officially classified by the military as "military [[working dog]]s," were not allowed to officially return home after the war.<ref>Burnam p. XI</ref> Classified as [[Expendability|expendable]] [[Military equipment|equipment]], of the approximate 4,000 US K-9s deployed to the Vietnam War, it is estimated that only about 200 US war dogs survived Vietnam to be put into service at other outposts stationed overseas.<ref name="Burnam p. XIV">Burnam p. XIV</ref> Aside from these 200 or so, the remaining canines who were not killed in action were either euthanised or left behind.<ref>{{cite web|author=Jessica Ravitz, CNN |url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/LIVING/02/12/war.dogs/index.html?hpt=C1 |title=CNN special report |publisher=Cnn.com |access-date=6 August 2014}}</ref>

The predominate canine selected by the [[US military]] during the Vietnam War was the [[German Shepherd Dog]], which was used in the roles of ''Scout Dogs'', ''Sentry Dogs'', ''Mine Detection Dogs'', and the US Navy used ''Water Dogs'' to detect enemy under water divers in [[South Vietnam]]. The Labrador Retriever was the military's choice for their ''Combat Tracker Teams'' (CTTs). Combat Tracker Teams consisted of one Labrador and four<ref name="Burnam p. 278">Burnam p. 278</ref> or five<ref name="CCT">{{cite web|title=The USARV Combat tracker team|url=http://www.combattrackerteam.org/CTT%20Mission%20Statement%20pages%201,2,3,4.htm|publisher=combattrackerteam.org|access-date=28 September 2016}}</ref> men: the [[Police dog|handler]], an observer, one or two cover men, and the team leader.<ref name=CCT /><ref>Burnam pp. 277–278</ref> Labradors were selected by the military for [[Tracking (dog)|tracking]] because of their distinct smelling qualities, and were used to locate wounded US servicemen, enemy patrols, and downed allied airmen in Vietnam. The US Army Labrador Retrievers received their combat training at the [[British Army]]'s [[British Army Jungle Warfare Training School|''Jungle Warfare School'']] in [[Malaysia]].<ref name="Burnam p. 278"/>

Of the over 4,000 US war dogs serving in the Vietnam War, 232 were killed in action,<ref>Burnam pp. 288–293</ref> and 295 US servicemen deployed as "dog handlers" were killed in action.<ref>Burnam pp. 281–288</ref> Dog handler [[Robert W. Hartsock]] was awarded the [[Medal of Honor]]. Six Labrador Retrievers were killed in action while assigned to the 62nd and 63rd US Army ''Combat Tracking Teams''.<ref>Burnam pp. 290–293</ref> During the course of the war the [[United States Army|US Army]] lost 204 dogs, while the [[United States Marine Corps|US Marine Corps]] and [[United States Air Force|US Air Force]] lost 13 and 15 dogs, respectively.

In November 2000, President [[Bill Clinton]] signed into law an amendment that allowed retired US military working dogs (war dogs) to be adopted by personnel outside of the military, leaving the Vietnam War as the only war in US history in which American war dogs never returned home.<ref name="Burnam p.
