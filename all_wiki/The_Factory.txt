'''The Factory''' was [[Andy Warhol]]'s [[New York City]] studio, which had three locations between 1962 and 1984. The original Factory was on the fifth floor at 231 [[47th Street (Manhattan)|East 47th Street]], in [[Midtown Manhattan]]. The rent was one hundred dollars per year.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Kornbluth |first=Jesse |date=March 9, 1987 |title=The World Of Warhol |magazine=New York |volume=20 |issue=10 |page=43 |issn=0028-7369 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R-UCAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA38}}</ref> Warhol left in 1967 when the building was scheduled to be torn down to make way for an apartment building. He then relocated his studio to the sixth floor of the [[Decker Building]] at 33 [[Union Square, Manhattan|Union Square West]] near the corner of [[16th Street (Manhattan)|East 16th Street]], where he was shot in 1968 by [[Valerie Solanas]]. The Factory was revamped and remained there until 1973. It moved to 860 [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]] at the north end of Union Square. Although this space was much larger, not much filmmaking took place there. In 1984 Warhol moved his remaining ventures, no longer including filming, to 22 [[33rd Street (Manhattan)|East 33rd Street]], a conventional office building.<ref>{{cite movielove}}, pp.150-152</ref> Many Warhol films, including those made at the Factory, were first (or later) shown at the [[New Andy Warhol Garrick Theatre]] or [[55th Street Playhouse]].<ref name="CT-2013">{{cite web |title=Garrick Cinema – 152 Bleecker Street, New York, NY 10012 |quote=Previous Names: New Andy Warhol Garrick Theatre, Andy Warhol's Garrick Cinema, Nickelodeon |url=http://cinematreasures.org/theaters/11737 |website=Cinema Treasures |accessdate=March 27, 2018 }}</ref><ref name="WarholAds">{{cite web |last=Garcia |first=Alfredo |title=1968 |website=Andy Warhol Films: Newspaper Adverts 1964–1974 |url=https://warholfilmads.wordpress.com/1968-2/ |date=October 11, 2017 |accessdate=March 27, 2018 }}</ref><ref name="FDR-20100803">{{cite book |author=Staff |title=Fodor's See It New York City |edition=4th |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jb2t50qpW2sC&pg=PA118 |date=2010 |publisher=[[Fodor's|Fodor's Travel Publications]] |isbn=978-1-4000-0498-0 |via=[[Google Books]] |accessdate=March 27, 2018 }}</ref><ref name="Joe-2011">{{cite book |last=Ferguson |first=Michael |title=Joe Dallesandro: Warhol Superstar, Underground Film Icon, Actor |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3-cVBgAAQBAJ&pg=PT101 |date=2015 |publisher=Open Road Media |isbn=978-1-5040-0654-5 |via=[[Google Books]] |accessdate=March 27, 2018 }}</ref>

== Description==
The original Factory was often referred to as the Silver Factory.<ref name="Factory Made 2003"/> In 1963, artist [[Ray Johnson]] took Warhol to a "haircutting party" at [[Billy Name]]'s apartment, decorated with tin foil and silver paint, and Warhol asked him to do the same scheme for his recently leased loft. Silver, fractured mirrors, and tin foil were the basic decorating materials loved by early amphetamine users of the sixties. Name covered the whole factory in silver, even the elevator. Warhol's years at the Factory were known as the Silver Era. Aside from the prints and paintings, Warhol produced shoes, films, sculptures and commissioned work in various genres to brand and sell items with his name. His first commissions consisted of a single silkscreen portrait for $25,000, with additional canvases in other colors for $5,000 each. He later increased the price of alternative colors to $20,000 each. Warhol used a large portion of his income to finance the Factory.<ref name="Factory Made 2003"/>

The Factory was the hip hangout for artistic types, [[amphetamine]] (speed) users, and the [[Warhol superstars]]. It was famed for its groundbreaking parties. In the studio, Warhol's workers would make [[silkscreen]]s and [[lithograph]]s under his direction. In 1968, Warhol moved the Factory to the sixth floor of the [[Decker Building]], 33 Union Square West, near [[Max's Kansas City]], a club which Warhol and his entourage frequently visited.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.maxskansascity.com/warhol/ |website=Max's Kansas City |date=March 25, 2010 |title=Warhol Automobile Paintings To Finally See Daylight}}</ref> By the time Warhol had achieved a reputation, he was working day and night on his paintings. Warhol used silkscreens so that he could mass-produce images the way corporations mass-produced consumer goods. To increase production, he attracted a ménage of [[adult film]] performers, [[drag queens]], socialites, drug addicts, musicians, and free-thinkers who became known as the Warhol Superstars, to help him. These "art-workers" helped him create his paintings, starred in his films, and created the atmosphere for which the Factory became legendary.

Speaking in 2002, musician [[John Cale]] said, "It wasn't called the Factory for nothing. It was where the [[assembly line]] for the silkscreens happened. While one person was making a silkscreen, somebody else would be filming a [[Screen Tests (films)|screen test]]. Every day something new."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/warhol/story/0,11478,648898,00.html |title=My 15 minutes | work=[[The Guardian (newspaper)|The Guardian]]|accessdate=October 5, 2014}}</ref>

Billy Name brought in the red couch which became a prominent furnishing at the Factory, finding it on the sidewalk of 47th street during one of his "midnight outings." The sofa quickly became a favorite place for Factory guests to crash overnight, usually after coming down from [[amphetamine|speed]]. It was featured in many photographs and films from the Silver era, including ''[[Couch (film)|Couch]]'' and ''[[Blow Job (1963 film)|Blow Job]]''. During the move in 1968, the couch was stolen while left unattended on the sidewalk for a short time.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.warholstars.org/indfoto/ibilly.html |title=Billy Name |website=warholstars.org}}</ref>

==Work==

=== Music ===
The Factory became a meeting place of artists and musicians such as [[Lou Reed]],<ref name="willett">{{cite book|last=Willett|first=Edward|title=Andy Warhol: Everyone Will Be Famous for 15 Minutes|year=2010|publisher=Enslow Publishers|isbn=978-0-766-03385-6|page=[https://archive.org/details/andywarholeveryo0000will/page/68 68]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/andywarholeveryo0000will/page/68}}</ref> [[Bob Dylan]], and [[Mick Jagger]], as well as writer [[Truman Capote]]. Less frequent visitors included [[Salvador Dalí]] and [[Allen Ginsberg]].<ref name="willett"/> Warhol collaborated with Reed's influential New York [[rock and roll|rock]] band [[the Velvet Underground]] in 1965, and designed the noted cover for ''[[The Velvet Underground & Nico]],'' the band's debut album. It featured a plastic image of a yellow banana, which users could peel off to reveal a flesh-hued version of the banana.<ref>{{cite book|last=Chapman|first=Peter|title=Bananas: How the United Fruit Company Shaped the World|year=2009|publisher=Canongate U.S.|isbn=978-1-847-67194-3|page=166}}</ref> Warhol also designed the album cover for [[the Rolling Stones]]' album ''[[Sticky Fingers]]''.<ref>{{cite book|last=Gair|first=Christopher |title=The American Counterculture|url=https://archive.org/details/americancounterc00gair|url-access=limited|year=2007|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|isbn=978-0-748-61989-4|page=[https://archive.org/details/americancounterc00gair/page/n191 185]}}</ref>

Warhol included the Velvet Underground in the [[Exploding Plastic Inevitable]], a spectacle that combined art, rock, Warhol films and dancers of all kinds, as well as live [[Sadomasochism|S&M]] enactments and imagery. The Velvet Underground and EPI used the Factory as a place to rehearse and hang out.<ref name="Factory Made 2003">{{cite book|last=Watson|first=Steven|title=Factory Made: Warhol and the Sixties|year=2003|publisher=Pantheon Books|isbn=0-679-42372-9}}</ref>{{rp|pages=253–254}}

"[[Walk on the Wild Side (Lou Reed song)|Walk on the Wild Side]]", Lou Reed's best-known song from his solo career, was released on his second, and first commercially successful, solo album, ''[[Transformer (Lou Reed album)|Transformer]]'' (1972). The song relates to the [[Warhol Superstar|superstars]] and life of the Factory. He mentions [[Holly Woodlawn]], [[Candy Darling]], [[Joe Dallesandro]], [[Jackie Curtis]] and [[Joe Campbell (actor)|Joe Campbell]] (referred to in the song by his Factory nickname Sugar Plum Fairy).<ref>{{cite book|last=Roberts|first=Chris|title=Lou Reed: Walk on the Wild Side : the Stories Behind the Songs|year=2004|publisher=Hal Leonard Corporation|isbn=0-634-08032-6|page=44}}</ref>

=== Sexual radicals ===
Andy Warhol commented on mainstream America through his art while disregarding its conservative social views. Almost all his work filmed at the Factory featured nudity, graphic sexuality, [[recreational drugs|drug use]], same-sex relations and [[transgender]] characters in much greater proportion to what was being shown in mainstream cinema. By making the films, Warhol created a sexually lenient environment at the Factory for the "[[happenings]]" staged there, which included fake weddings between drag queens, porn film rentals, and vulgar plays. What was called [[free love]] took place in the studio, as sexuality in the 1960s was becoming more open and embraced as a high ideal. Warhol used footage of sexual acts between his friends in his work, such as in ''[[Blue Movie]]'', a 1969 film directed, produced, written and cinematographed by Warhol. The film, starring [[Viva (actress)|Viva]] and [[Louis Waldon]], was the first [[pornographic|adult erotic film]] depicting explicit [[sex]] to receive wide theatrical release in the [[United States]].<ref name="NYT-19690722">{{cite news |last=Canby |first=Vincent |authorlink=Vincent Canby |title=Screen: Andy Warhol's 'Blue Movie' |url-access=subscription |url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9507E5D91738E63ABC4A51DFB1668382679EDE |date=July 22, 1969 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=December 29, 2015 }}</ref><ref name="WS-2002-2005">{{cite web |last=Comenas |first=Gary |title=Blue Movie (1968) |url=http://www.warholstars.org/andy-warhol-blue-movie.html |date=2005 |website=warholstars.org |accessdate=December 29, 2015 }}</ref><ref name="NYT-19690810">{{cite news |last=Canby |first=Vincent |authorlink=Vincent Canby |title=Warhol's Red Hot and 'Blue' Movie |url-access=subscription |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9807E4D91739EF3BBC4852DFBE668382679EDE |date=August 10, 1969 |work=The New York Times |accessdate=December 29, 2015 }}</ref>

[[Holly Woodlawn]] and [[Jackie Curtis]] were noted [[drag queens]] who were part of the Factory group, as was [[transgender]] woman [[Candy Darling]]. Andy Warhol frequently used these women and other sexual non-conformists in his films, plays, and events. Because of the constant drug use and the presence of sexually liberal artists and radicals, drugged orgies were a frequent happening at the Factory. Warhol met [[Ondine (actor)|Ondine]] at an [[orgy]] in 1962:

{{quote|I was at an orgy, and [Warhol] was, ah, this great presence in the back of the room. And this orgy was run by a friend of mine, and, so, I said to this person, "Would you please mind throwing that thing [Warhol] out of here?" And that thing was thrown out of there, and when he came up to me the next time, he said to me, "Nobody has ever thrown me out of a party." He said, "You know? Don't you know who I am?" And I said, "Well, I don't give a good flying fuck who you are. You just weren't there. You weren't involved..."<ref>{{cite web |title=Warholstars Timeline |url=http://warholstars.org/chron/192862.html |website=warholstars.org}}</ref>|Ondine}}

=== Films ===
{{main|Andy Warhol filmography}}
Warhol started shooting movies in the Factory around 1963, when he began work on ''Kiss''. He screened his films at the Factory for his friends before they were released for public audiences. When traditional theaters refused to screen his more provocative films, Warhol sometimes turned to night-clubs or porn theaters, including the [[New Andy Warhol Garrick Theatre]] and the [[55th Street Playhouse]],<ref name="CT-2013" /><ref name="WarholAds" /><ref name="FDR-20100803" /><ref name="Joe-2011" /> for their distribution.
