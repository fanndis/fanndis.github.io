'''Janice Kay Brewer''' ([[née]] '''Drinkwine''', formerly '''Warren'''; born September 26, 1944)<ref name="Curr Bio">{{cite book|title=Current Biography Yearbook 2011|year=2011|publisher=H. W. Wilson|location=Ipswich, MA|isbn=9780824211219|pages=[https://archive.org/details/currentbiography0000unse_z0h6/page/92 92–95]|chapter=Brewer, Jan|chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/currentbiography0000unse_z0h6/page/92}}</ref> is an American politician and author who served as the 22nd [[List of governors of Arizona|Governor of Arizona]] from 2009 to 2015. A member of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], Brewer is the fourth woman (and was the third consecutive woman) to serve as Governor of Arizona. Brewer assumed the governorship as part of the [[line of succession]], as determined by the [[Arizona Constitution]], when Governor [[Janet Napolitano]] resigned to become [[United States Secretary of Homeland Security|U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security]]. Brewer had served as [[Secretary of State of Arizona]] from January 2003 to January 2009.

Born in [[California]], Brewer attended [[Glendale Community College (Arizona)|Glendale Community College]], from where she received a radiological technologist certificate; she has never earned a college degree. She served as a State Representative and State Senator for Arizona from 1983 to 1996. Brewer also served as Chairman of the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors before running for Arizona Secretary of State in 2002.

As governor, Brewer signed the [[Support Our Law Enforcement and Safe Neighborhoods Act]]. The act makes it a state [[misdemeanor]] crime for an immigrant to be in Arizona without carrying registration documents required by federal law, authorizes state and local law enforcement of [[Federal government of the United States|federal]] [[immigration law]]s, and cracks down on those sheltering, hiring and transporting undocumented immigrants. Brewer sought and was [[2010 Arizona gubernatorial election|elected]] to a full term as Governor of Arizona in 2010.

==Early life, education and family==
{{Conservatism US}}
Brewer was born Janice Kay Drinkwine on September 26, 1944, in [[Hollywood]], [[Los Angeles]], the daughter of Edna C. (née Bakken) and Perry Wilford Drinkwine, then a civilian supervisor at the [[Hawthorne Army Depot]] in [[Hawthorne, Nevada]].<ref name="about"/><ref>{{cite news|location=New York |newspaper=Daily News|last=Daly |first=Michael |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/2010/04/27/2010-04-27_descendant_of_immigrants_wants_to_slam_golden_door.html |title=Arizona Gov.

She married John Leon Brewer in Nevada and worked briefly in [[Glendale, California]], before moving to her husband's hometown of [[Phoenix, Arizona]], in 1970. The couple later relocated to [[Glendale, Arizona]], where John became a successful chiropractor, in addition to finding some [[real estate]] success. They settled in the Deer Valley section of Phoenix.<ref name="about"/>

==Political career==

===State legislature===
Initially interested in running for school board, Brewer soon saw an opening in her local legislative district, and decided to run for State Representative. Brewer would go on to serve in the [[Arizona House of Representatives]] for three years, from 1983 to 1987, before deciding to run for the [[Arizona Senate]], where she would serve from 1987 to 1996. As state senator, Brewer sought legislation with the intention of creating an office of lieutenant governor in the state, arguing that holding the office of Secretary of State does not make a candidate qualified for governor, and that the office should be filled by a member of the same party, should a vacancy arise.<ref name="about"/> During her last three years as a state senator, she held the senior leadership position of [[majority whip]].<ref name="about"/>

In 1996 Brewer ran for chairman of the [[Maricopa County]] Board of Supervisors, defeating incumbent Ed King, and served for six years on the board. She inherited a debt of $165&nbsp;million.<ref name="about"/>

===Secretary of State of Arizona===
[[File:Jan Brewer 2008.jpg|thumb|150px|Secretary of State]]
In early 2002, Brewer created a campaign committee to run for the office of [[Secretary of State of Arizona]], to replace outgoing Arizona Secretary of State [[Betsey Bayless]]. Brewer ran against Phoenix Councilman Sal DiCiccio in the primary race. Brewer won by a narrow margin of just 23,000 votes.<ref name="about"/>

As Secretary of State, Brewer instituted a vote-by-fax program for overseas military troops, which would later be adopted by other municipalities, including [[San Francisco]]. Brewer also helped marshal changes brought about by [[Arizona Proposition 200 (2004)|Arizona Proposition 200]], which required citizens in the state to show proof of citizenship before registering to vote or applying for public benefits.<ref name="about"/>

===Governor of Arizona===

Governor [[Janet Napolitano]] was selected by President [[Barack Obama]] to serve as the [[United States Secretary of Homeland Security|Secretary of Homeland Security]] in the [[United States Cabinet]]. Since Arizona has no lieutenant governor, the Secretary of State stands first in the line of succession if he or she holds that post as a result of an election. Despite her earlier quarrels with the line of succession while serving in the State Senate, Brewer was sworn in as governor after Napolitano resigned from her position on January 21, 2009. She became Arizona's fourth [[List of female state governors in the United States|female governor]] and its third consecutive female governor.<ref name="about"/>

In her inaugural address, Brewer promised to keep taxes low in Arizona, in an attempt to attract business from other states, including [[California]]. Fewer than two months into her term, however, Brewer proposed a tax increase in front of the State Legislature, prompting Republican state Sen. Ron Gould to walk out of the address mid-speech.<ref>{{cite news |author=Matthew Benson |author2=Mary Jo Pitzl |date= March 5, 2009 |newspaper=The Arizona Republic |title=Brewer lists steps to keep state afloat |url=https://www.azcentral.com/arizonarepublic/news/articles/2009/03/05/20090305brewer0305.html |accessdate=October 16, 2013}}</ref> Attempting to rationalize the tax increase, Brewer stated that she was ultimately forced to ask for the increase due to the state's $4&nbsp;billion state budget deficit.<ref name="about"/>

[[File:JanBrewer PresObama.jpg|thumb|left|Governor Jan Brewer meeting with President Barack Obama in June 2010.]]
On April 23, 2010, Brewer signed the [[Support Our Law Enforcement and Safe Neighborhoods Act]], otherwise known as Arizona SB1070, into law, making it "a state crime for illegal immigrants to not have an alien registration document", and requiring police "to question people about their immigration status if there is reason". It also makes it illegal for people to hire illegal immigrants for day labor or to knowingly transport them. In addition, it provides provisions to allow citizens to file lawsuits against government agencies that hinder enforcement of immigration laws.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.kpho.com/politics/23179490/detail.html |title=Ariz.

On June 3, 2010, Brewer met with President Barack Obama to discuss immigration along Mexico's border with Arizona, and how the federal government could work together with state officials to combat violence there. Brewer remarked after the meeting, "I am encouraged that there is going to be much better dialogue between the federal government and the state of Arizona now."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://mobile.latimes.com/inf/infomo?view=topstoriesitem&feed:a=latimes_1min&feed:c=topstories&feed:i=54093329 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100608155005/http://mobile.latimes.com/inf/infomo?view=topstoriesitem&feed%3Aa=latimes_1min&feed%3Ac=topstories&feed%3Ai=54093329 |url-status=dead |archive-date=June 8, 2010 |title=Arizona Gov.

On August 24, 2010, Brewer won the Republican primary, to face [[Attorney General of Arizona|Arizona Attorney General]] [[Terry Goddard]] in the general election.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://results.enr.clarityelections.com/AZ/19539/31658/en/summary.html |title=Arizona Gubernatorial Primary Results |work=Arizona SOS|date=August 24, 2010|accessdate=September 2, 2010}}</ref> Brewer was elected in her own right on November 2, 2010, to the office of governor in the state's [[2010 Arizona gubernatorial election|2010 gubernatorial election]], earning 55% of the states votes over Democrat [[Terry Goddard]] with 42%. Polling conducted after Brewer's signing of Arizona SB1070 had shown her as an early favorite in the general election, and she was sworn in for a full term on January 3, 2011, on the State Capitol grounds in Phoenix.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/elections/election_2010/election_2010_governor_elections/arizona/election_2010_arizona_governor|title=Election 2010: Arizona Governor|publisher=Rasmussen Reports|date=May 21, 2010|accessdate=June 5, 2010}}</ref>

As a result of a ballot measure approved by the voters in 2000, [[redistricting]] in Arizona is entrusted to a five-member panel with an independent chair. In 2011, Republicans wanted more favorable lines than those drawn by the commission, and Brewer sent a letter purporting to remove Colleen Mathis, the independent chair, from office. The [[Arizona Supreme Court]] ruled that Brewer's action was illegal and it reinstated Mathis.<ref>{{cite news|last=Powers|first=Ashley|title=Court reinstates ousted head of Arizona redistricting panel|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=November 17, 2011|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/nationnow/2011/11/arizona-redistricting-battle-jan-brewer-colleen-mathis.html|accessdate=November 18, 2011}}</ref>

[[File:Jan Brewer by Gage Skidmore 2.jpg|right|thumb|Brewer speaking to the 2012 Republican state convention in Phoenix, Arizona.]]
Brewer was not able to run for a second full four-year term in 2014. The [[Arizona Constitution]] limits the governor to two consecutive terms, regardless of whether they serve full or partial terms. However, former governors are allowed to seek additional nonconsecutive terms after a four-year respite. In November 2012, Brewer declared she was looking into what she called "ambiguity" in Arizona's term-limit law to seek a third term.<ref name="politico.com">{{cite news |url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1112/83720.html |title= Report: Jan Brewer may seek 3rd term as Arizona governor |work=[[Politico]] |date=November 12, 2012 |accessdate=November 13, 2012}}</ref> In February 2014, Brewer reiterated that she was considering running for re-election,<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.azcentral.com/news/politics/articles/20140224brewer-hard-let-go-governing-decides-whether-seek-re-election.html |title= Brewer says it's hard to let go of governing as she decides whether to seek re-election |work=AZ Central |date=February 24, 2014 |accessdate=March 3, 2014}}</ref> but on March 12, 2014, she announced that she would not attempt to seek another term in office, which would have required what ''[[The Arizona Republic]]'' called a "long-shot court challenge".<ref name=not>{{cite news |url=https://www.azcentral.com/news/politics/articles/20140312arizona-governor-jan-brewer-not-running-again.html |title= Arizona Gov.

== Post-governorship ==
On January 26, 2017, Brewer confirmed she agreed with President Trump's proposed border wall and said she believed in him.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.newsmax.com/Politics/jan-brewer-grateful-push-build/2017/01/26/id/770589/|title=Jan Brewer 'Grateful' for Push to Build Mexico Wall|date=January 26, 2017|first=Sandy|last=Fitzgerald}}</ref>  
In late March 2017, during a phone interview, Brewer expressed opposition to President Trump's [[American Health Care Act]]: "This would devastate the most vulnerable, this would devastate rural hospitals, they will probably close down and those jobs would be lost".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.azfamily.com/story/34986757/brewer-at-odds-with-trump-on-health-care-bill|title=Brewer at odds with Trump on health care bill|first=Dennis|last=Welch|publisher=azfamily.com|date=March 23, 2017}}</ref>

==Political views==

===Budget===

A challenge Brewer faced when she took office in 2009 was to resolve a multibillion-dollar budget shortfall that was the most dire of any state in the nation.<ref name="budget issues">{{cite web|last1=Kurz|first1=Isiah|title=AZ Fact Check article |url=https://www.azcentral.com/news/politics/azfactcheck/fact-story.php?id=492|website=azcentral|accessdate=April 9, 2015}}</ref> To combat the deficit, the Governor established a decision making process that forced Arizona to clearly define the appropriate role and scope of State Government and to focus narrowly on delivering those necessary services in the most effective and prudent manner possible.

Brewer's response to the fiscal crisis consisted of two main components.  First, she reduced the size and scope of state government while prioritizing funding for public safety and education.

Second, she proposed a three-year temporary sales tax increase, which voters approved.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Small|first1=Jim |title=Poll shows voters favor Brewer's budget over lawmakers'|url=http://azcapitoltimes.com/news/2009/06/23/poll-shows-voters-favor-brewers-budget-over-lawmakers/|website=azcapitoltimes.com|accessdate=April 9, 2015|date=June 23, 2009 }}</ref> The proposal was intended to raise 1&nbsp;billion dollars a year in order to reduce the $3&nbsp;billion/year deficit.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703745904575248371346932474?mod=WSJ_Opinion_AboveLEFTTop&mg=com-wsj|title=Review & Outlook: Grand Canyon Sales Tax Showdown |publisher=The Wall Street Journal|date=May 17, 2010|accessdate=July 18, 2010}}</ref> She also borrowed approximately $1&nbsp;billion in an attempt to match expenditures.<ref name="seatimes">{{cite news|first=Bob |last=Christie|title=Arizona Gov.

===Economic initiatives===

Brewer created the Arizona Commerce Authority (ACA)<ref>{{cite web|last1=Beard|first1=Bety|title=Governor Brewer Creates Commerce Authority|url=http://archive.azcentral.com/arizonarepublic/business/articles/20100630arizona-commerce-authority-creation.html |website=azcentral.com|accessdate=April 10, 2015}}</ref> to serve as the statewide economic development organization. The ACA board of directors consists of business people,<ref>{{cite web|title=About Us: Board of Directors|url=http://www.azcommerce.com/about-us/board-of-directors|website=azcommerce.com|accessdate=April 10, 2015}}</ref> with the intent to focus on business attraction, retention, and expansion in Arizona's economic sectors.

The Governor also armed the ACA with a $25&nbsp;million deal closing fund<ref>{{cite web|title=Arizona Competitiveness Package |url=http://www.mesaaz.gov/home/showdocument?id=10117|website=mesaaz.gov|accessdate=April 10, 2015}}</ref> to help attract employers and replaced incentive programs with performance based tax credits.

With the help of the ACA, Arizona employers have created nearly 175,000 new jobs with an impressive 4.9&nbsp;billion dollars in new capital investment.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} The ACA is also engaged in a national and international campaign to increase business attraction and direct foreign investment.

====Arizona Biomedical Corridor====

In 2013, Arizona State University, the Mayo Clinic, and the City of Phoenix established the Arizona Biomedical Corridor through contractor KUD International.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Gonzales|first1=Angela|title=KUD International buying 225 acres near Mayo in Phoenix for biomedical corridor|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/phoenix/news/2013/07/01/kud-international-buying-225-acres.html |website=bizjournals.com}}</ref> Brewer guided the State Selection Boards' approval of a beneficiary re-designation on 25 acres of State Trust land whereby Trust lands designated for K-12 Education were exchanged for University Lands.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Gonzales |first1=Angela|title=Arizona Biomedical Corridor one step closer to development |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/phoenix/blog/health-care-daily/2014/09/arizona-biomedical-corridor-one-step-closer-to.html|website=bizjournals.com|accessdate=April 10, 2015}}</ref>   This allows the implementation of Arizona State University's plans to establish post-secondary education and research facilities closely tied to the Mayo Hospital's mission.

====Tax reforms====

During Brewer's tenure Arizona's tax code underwent significant changes.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Duda|first1=Jeremy|title=Brewer Signs Sales Tax Reform Bill|url=http://www.arizonatax.org/news-article/brewer-signs-sales-tax-reform-bill |website=arizonatax.org |accessdate=April 10, 2015}}</ref> In addition to the increase in sales tax Brewer reduced business property and equipment taxes and corporate income tax.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://archive.azcentral.com/news/election/azelections/articles/20110215arizona-budget-tax-cuts-job-creation.html|title=Gov.

In addition to shifting tax rates away from business, she also undertook a simplification of tax filings. Brewer convened a task force in 2012 to develop recommendations that would simplify the tax code, reduce taxpayer confusion and improve compliance and efficiency.  Thanks to legislation enacted in 2013 and 2014, many task force recommendations are now law and have phased in throughout 2015, including single point of administration and collection, a single and uniform audit program, uniform state and city licensing procedures, and prime contracting relief for trade and service contractors.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Staff Report|title=Gov. signs milestone sales-tax reform bill|url=http://arizona.newszap.com/westvalley/123549-114/gov-signs-milestone-sales-tax-reform-bill%20 |website=arizona.newszap.com|accessdate=April 10, 2015|url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160119124311/http://arizona.newszap.com/westvalley/123549-114/gov-signs-milestone-sales-tax-reform-bill%20|archivedate=January 19, 2016}}</ref>

===Education===

====K-12 reform====

Brewer enacted policies that gave schools A-F letter grades, provided additional funding to schools that improved student performance, and evaluated and rewarded teachers based on effectiveness rather than seniority.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.alec.org/app/uploads/2015/11/2015alecreportcardfinalweb-151110162215-lva1-app6891.pdf|title=Bellwether Education Partners|date=August 2012|accessdate=June 8, 2018}}</ref>

====State charter school funding====

Brewer expanded access to private schools by increasing tax credits for school tuition organizations and creating empowerment scholarship accounts.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} Since 2010, charter school enrollment increased by more than 30,000 students and funding for private school choice options increased by more than 50%.<ref>{{cite web|last1=AZ Department of Revenue|title=School Tax Credit Info|url=http://www.azed.gov/research-evaluation/arizona-enrollment-figures/|website=azdor.gov|accessdate=April 10, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=AZ Dept. of Education|title=Arizona October 1 Enrollment Figures|url=http://www.azed.gov/research-evaluation/arizona-enrollment-figures/|website=azed.gov|accessdate=April 10, 2015}}</ref>

====Ethnic studies====

On May 11, 2010, Brewer signed into law legislation that banned the teaching of ethnic studies classes in Arizona public schools.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://articles.latimes.com/2010/may/12/nation/la-na-ethnic-studies-20100512|title=Arizona bill targeting ethnic studies signed into law|last=Cruz|first=Nicole Santa|date=May 12, 2010|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=February 26, 2017 |issn=0458-3035}}</ref>

====Higher education====
Since 2010, Arizona's public institutions have increased the number of certificates and degrees awarded by more than 28%.<ref>{{cite web|title=Arizona Community Colleges 2014 Outcomes Report |url=http://www.arizonacommunitycolleges.org/outcomes2014/pdf/azcc_2014_district_outcomes_report.pdf|website=arizonacommunitycolleges.org|accessdate=April 10, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Board of Regents|title=University System Quick Facts |url=http://www.azregents.edu/universitysystemquickfacts/default.aspx|website=azregents.edu|accessdate=April 10, 2015 |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150415235319/http://www.azregents.edu/universitysystemquickfacts/default.aspx|archivedate=April 15, 2015}}</ref>

===Health care===

Arizona, at Brewer's direction, joined a coalition of 26 other states to fight the Affordable Care Act (ACA) in the U.S. Supreme Court. The court, however, upheld most of the ACA's provisions.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Liptak|first1=Adam|title=Supreme Court Upholds Healthcare Law, 5-4, in Victory for Obama |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/29/us/supreme-court-lets-health-law-largely-stand.html|website=nytimes.com|accessdate=April 10, 2015}}</ref> One of the sections that the Court made optional was the requirement that states expand Medicaid eligibility to childless adults at or below 133% of the federal poverty level (FPL).

The court decision had unique implications for Arizona because the voters had already expanded Medicaid coverage to all individuals up to 100% of FPL when they passed Proposition 204 in 2000.<ref>{{cite web|last1=AZ Secretary of State|title=State of Arizona Official Canvass 2000 General Election|url=http://apps.azsos.gov/election/2000/General/Canvass2000GE.pdf|website=azsos.gov|accessdate=April 10, 2015}}</ref>

After much debate, the Governor's Medicaid Restoration plan was enacted, taking Federal money through the ACA to expand Medicaid.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Reuters/Webb|first1=Darryl|title=Arizona Governor Jan Brewer Signs Medicaid Expansion |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/06/17/us-usa-arizona-medicaid-idUSBRE95G12N20130617|website=reuters.com|accessdate=April 10, 2015}}</ref>

====Behavioral health====

To serve individuals who have a serious mental illness (SMI), but do not qualify for Medicaid, $39&nbsp;million was added to the budget for additional services.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Pitzl|first1=Mary Jo|title=Brewer, legislative leaders announce budget deal |url=http://archive.azcentral.com/arizonarepublic/news/articles/2012/04/27/20120427brewer-legislative-leaders-announce-budget-deal.html|website=azcentral.com|accessdate=April 10, 2015}}</ref>  Arizona ranks fifth nationally in spending on community-based programs and has the fewest residents per capita living in a state psychiatric hospital.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

Arizona's behavioral health system for Maricopa County individuals with SMI has been overseen by the ''Arnold'' v. ''Sarn'' lawsuit for more than thirty years.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} Brewer and the plaintiffs reached an agreement that ends this litigation by reaffirming Arizona's commitment to a community-based behavioral health system of care.<ref>{{cite web|last1=AZPM Staff |title=Maricopa Court Dismisses 3-Decade Mental Health Suit Arnold v.

The agreement builds national behavioral health standards into the system, requires an annual quality service review to determine if patient needs are being identified and addressed and an annual independent service capacity analysis be performed to ensure there are sufficient providers to meet patient needs.

The agreement is structured so that it remains enforceable by the courts should Arizona not live up to its commitments in the future. This guarantees Arizona will maintain its commitment to a community-based behavioral health system.

Brewer directed the Arizona Department of Health Services to integrate behavioral and physical health care for Title XIX eligible SMI members through a "Recovery through Whole Health" program.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Arizona Center for Law in the Public Interest |title=Arnold v.

====Health care cuts====

In the face of a mounting budget crisis in Arizona, Brewer signed the 2011 legislative budget, which eliminates the Arizona variant of the [[State Children's Health Insurance Program]], known as [[KidsCare]], that provides health insurance to uninsured children<ref>{{cite news|last=Sack|first=Kevin|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/19/health/policy/19arizona.html|title=Arizona Drops Children's Health Program |newspaper=The New York Times |date=April 23, 2010|accessdate=April 27, 2010}}</ref> whose families' income exceeds the Medicaid cutoff.<ref>{{cite news |last=Beard |first=Alia |url=https://www.azcentral.com/news/articles/2010/03/20/20100320arizona-kids-lose-health-coverage.html |title=Needy Arizona children to lose health care, medicine coverage |newspaper=The Arizona Republic |date=March 20, 2010 |accessdate=April 27, 2010}}</ref> According to the FY 2011 budget, enrollment caps will also be put into place for Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System (AHCCCS), thereby limiting access to the program. Brewer, at a press conference, said the state had no choice but to eliminate the free health care programs saying, "We do not have the money {{interp|...}} We are broke."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.douglasdispatch.com/articles/2010/03/24/news/food/doc4ba94271a30d9447198286.txt|title=Budget cuts 310,000 enrolled in AHCCCS |last=Fischer |first=Howard |newspaper=Douglas Dispatch |date=March 24, 2010|accessdate=April 27, 2010}}</ref>

In 2011, Brewer stopped Medicaid funding for organ transplants to save $1.4&nbsp;million; 98 patients were waiting for transplants.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/03/06/us-arizona-transplants-idUSTRE7242GN20110306 |title=Transplant patients a target of Arizona budget cuts |author=Tim Gaynor |publisher=Reuters |date=March 5, 2011}}</ref> After criticism, the funding was restored.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

Brewer called a special session of the [[Arizona Legislature]] to join in the class-action lawsuit by 21 state Attorneys General to challenge the constitutionality of that part of the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]], which establishes a federal individual mandate to purchase health insurance.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.yumasun.com/opinion/health-57300-law-new.html |title=Constitutionality of health law is not yet clear |last=Ross |first=Terry |newspaper=Yuma Sun |date=March 27, 2010 |accessdate=April 27, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130209230848/http://www.yumasun.com/opinion/health-57300-law-new.html |archivedate=February 9, 2013  }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Lane |first=Charles |url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/postpartisan/2010/03/is_health_reform_unconstitutio.html|title=Is health reform unconstitutional?

We propose to address this dual challenge head-on by making coverage broadly and fairly available" (and propose that reform should)" combine guarantee-issue coverage with no pre-existing condition exclusions with an enforceable individual mandate" ''Health care reform proposals of America's Health Insurance Plans, an industry lobby group.</ref>

In 2013 Brewer defended her support for Obamacare, and called it a "moral issue".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.politico.com/story/2013/06/arizona-jan-brewer-medicaid-obamacare-92304.html |title=Arizona's Jan Brewer becomes unlikely ally of Obamacare |publisher=Politico.com |date=June 6, 2013 |accessdate=July 19, 2013}}</ref>

===Human services===

Brewer abolished the Child Protective Services (CPS) department and created the Department of Child Safety (DCS) – a permanent, stand-alone agency with the express mission of safeguarding Arizona's abused and neglected children.<ref>{{cite web|last1=AZ Department of Child Safety|title=Governor Brewer Signs Landmark Child Safety Reform Legislation|url=https://dcs.az.gov/governor-brewer-signs-landmark-child-safety-reform-legislation|website=dcs.az.gov|accessdate=April 10, 2015}}</ref> As part of the new agency, the Office of Child Welfare Investigations will continue to investigate the highest priority cases of criminal conduct.

All 6,596 cases that were previously not investigated have been investigated and closed.  A quarter of the 12,695 inactive cases have already been closed and the entire backlog will be reopened and reviewed by January 2015.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Bierman|first1=Breann |title=Arizona closes 6,600 ignored child-abuse cases|url=http://www.kpho.com/story/26630655/brewer-all-not-investigated-cps-cases-now-closed%20cbs5az.com|website=cbs5az.com|accessdate=April 10, 2015}}</ref>

The Office serves as a statewide faith and community initiative resource and promotes service and volunteerism throughout the state.

===State government reform===

As governor, Brewer reformed its personnel system, toward a system modeled after the private sector.<ref>{{cite web|title=Personnel Reform|url=http://hr.az.gov/PR/index.html|website=hr.az.gov|accessdate=April 10, 2015}}</ref> As part of the reform effort, a number of pivotal actions were implemented including<ref>{{cite web|last1=McCarthy|first1=Kevin|title=Brewer's state employee personnel reform will benefit all Arizonans|url=http://azcapitoltimes.com/news/2012/03/19/brewer%E2%80%99s-state-employee-personnel-reform-will-benefit-all-arizonans/|website=azcapitoltimes.com|accessdate=April 10, 2015}}</ref> consolidating the Governor's control over personnel, implementing at-will workforce, implemented a performance management system and pay practices to recognize and reward top performers, and other measures.

By March 2013, 80% of the employees were at-will.

On July 11, 2010, Brewer announced that $10&nbsp;million given to her state by the federal government, most of which was intended to go to education, would instead go to enforcing border security.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2010/07/20/brewer-sends-stimulus-money-border-illegal-immigration-fight/ |title=Brewer Sends Stimulus Money to Border for Illegal Immigration Fight |publisher=Fox News |date=July 20, 2010 |accessdate=July 19, 2013}}</ref>

In accordance with her long standing anti-illegal immigrant policies, Brewer signed [[Arizona SB 1070]] into law in 2010, creating a significant controversy.<ref>{{cite web|title=Fact Sheet for S.B. 1070 |url=http://www.azleg.gov/legtext/49leg/2r/summary/s.1070pshs.doc.htm|website=azleg.gov|accessdate=April 10, 2015}}</ref> SB 1070 made it a state misdemeanor for an alien to be in Arizona without carrying the required documents, as well as other provisions. When the Obama Administration challenged SB 1070 in court the Governor defended the law.  Additionally, Brewer repeatedly urged President Obama and Congress to utilize the National Guard, Border Patrol agents, and technology to secure the southern border once and for all.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Security Newswire|title=Arizona Governor Unveils Border Security Plan |url=http://www.securitymagazine.com/articles/80888-arizona-governor-unveils-border-security-plan-1|website=securitymagazine.com |accessdate=April 23, 2010}}</ref>

In addition to signing [[Arizona SB 1070]], she has prohibited state and local governments from giving any public benefits to illegal aliens, in addition to making it a misdemeanor for a state or local government official to fail to report immigration law violations discovered while administering a public benefit or service. Brewer has also supported efforts to re-deploy the [[Arizona National Guard]] along the southern Arizona border, in an attempt to provide increased border security.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/obama-authorizes-deployment-national-guard-southwest/story?id=10740858|title=Obama OKs Deployment of Troops to Border|date=May 26, 2010|website=ABC News|language=en|access-date=June 1, 2018}}</ref>

In February 2016, Brewer endorsed businessman [[Donald Trump]] for President of the United States, praising his views on immigration:

Under Brewer, Arizona stepped up its efforts to decrease forest fire risk by thinning approximately 29,000 forested acres on state land.<ref>{{cite web|last1=McKinnon|first1=Shaun|title=Company selected to clear Arizona forest overgrowth |url=https://www.azcentral.com/news/politics/articles/2012/05/18/20120518arizona-forest-overgrowth.html |website=azcentral.com |accessdate=May 19, 2012}}</ref>

Under Brewer's direction, the State Land Department negotiated a $200&nbsp;million, 60.9 mile long high pressure natural gas pipeline beginning west of the Tucson Mountain Park and continuing south along State Highway 286 to the United States border with Mexico near Sasabe, Arizona, largely traveling through state trust land.<ref>{{cite web|title=KMEP places Sierrita gas pipeline into service |url=http://www.ogj.com/articles/2014/10/kmep-places-sierrita-gas-pipeline-into-service.html|website=ogj.com |accessdate=November 3, 2014}}</ref>

Brewer directed the Arizona Department of Water Resources to develop ''Arizona's Next Century: A Strategic Vision for Water Supply Sustainability'', a document outlining Arizona's water use plan.<ref>{{cite web|author=AZ Dept. of Water Resources|title=Arizona's Next Century: A Strategic Vision for Water Supply Sustainability|url=http://www.azwater.gov/AzDWR/Arizonas_Strategic_Vision/ |website=azwater.gov|accessdate=June 8, 2018}}</ref> The "Vision" was the necessary first step, organizing the state into 22 planning areas and envisioning options.

Brewer issued Executive Order 2013–02 to develop land and natural resources management strategies for sustainable economic growth and establishing the National Resources Review Council (NRRC).<ref>{{cite web|title=Arizona Natural Resources Review Council |url=http://gis.azland.gov/nrrc/|website=gis.azland.gov|accessdate=April 10, 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150418213637/http://gis.azland.gov/nrrc/|archivedate=April 18, 2015}}</ref> The NRRC prepared an Interim Report containing recommendations from five subcommittees (Clearinghouse, Engagement and Partnering, GIS, Mitigation and [[Conservation Banking]] and Planning). The recommendations start with the creation of a single point of contact (OSPB) that will receive all federal natural resource requests and make sure all appropriate state natural resource agencies have been notified and help coordinate appropriate response(s) on behalf of the state.

===Energy===

Under Brewer, Arizona went from number six in the nation for solar to number three.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Ringle|first1=Hayley |title=Snowy Massachusetts bumps sunny Arizona in solar rankings|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/phoenix/blog/energy-inc/2015/02/snowy-massachusetts-bumps-sunny-arizona-in-solar.html?page=all|website=bizjournals.com|publisher=Phoenix Business Journal |accessdate=February 12, 2015}}</ref>

In October 2014, Brewer announced the creation of the Arizona Collaboratory for Advanced Energy Solutions (AZ CAES), which was a partnership of industry, Arizona universities, government, non-profits and national laboratories designed to increase Arizona's competitive advantage in securing public funding, private funding and sponsored energy research at the three state universities.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Brug|first1=Leisa|title=Governor Jan Brewer Unveils Arizona Collaboratory for Advanced Energy Solutions |url=http://www.azenergy.gov/doclib/10-2-14%20NR%20Gov%20Brewer%20Unveils%20AZ%20CAES.pdf|website=azenergy.gov|publisher=Governor's Office of Energy Policy|accessdate=October 2, 2014|url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141215200326/http://www.azenergy.gov/doclib/10-2-14%20NR%20Gov%20Brewer%20Unveils%20AZ%20CAES.pdf|archivedate=December 15, 2014}}</ref>

Brewer adopted a state energy plan and established energy goals for Arizona in 2014.<ref>{{cite web|last1=AZPM Staff|title=Brewer Approves Master Energy Plan for Arizona|url=https://news.azpm.org/p/local-news/2014/2/19/30441-brewer-approves-master-energy-plan-for-arizona/|website=news.azpm.org|accessdate=February 19, 2014|url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150415082130/https://news.azpm.org/p/local-news/2014/2/19/30441-brewer-approves-master-energy-plan-for-arizona/|archivedate=April 15, 2015}}</ref> The plan was designed to increase solar development; promote energy education and energy sector apprenticeship and job training opportunities; reduce energy use in state buildings through the creation of $1.1&nbsp;million revolving loan fund for energy efficiency projects; and create a State Energy Advisory Board to address energy issues on an annual basis.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Governor's Office of Energy Policy|title=emPOWER Arizona |url=https://sustainability.asu.edu/docs/scn/5-13-14-SCN.pdf|website=sustainability.asu.edu|accessdate=May 13, 2014|url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160119124310/https://sustainability.asu.edu/docs/scn/5-13-14-SCN.pdf|archivedate=January 19, 2016}}</ref>

Arizona's Energy Assurance Plan was updated with a grant from the U.S. Department of Energy.  Last updated in 2006, the plan identified clear channels of communication and procedures in the event of an extended energy emergency.  Multiple energy emergency table-top drills and training on city, state and regional levels were conducted with participants from all energy sectors.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Drennon|first1=David|title=Grant funds to update Arizona's energy emergency plan |url=https://asunews.asu.edu/20101108_energy|website=asunews.asu.edu|accessdate=November 8, 2010}}</ref>

Due to a change in Mexican law opening up energy markets between the United States and Mexico, a bi-national energy assessment was completed.  Presented to Brewer and Sonora Governor Padres, both signed a Declaration of Cooperation between the two states to evaluate on an ongoing basis viable energy exchange opportunities.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Bi-National Electricity Transmission Task Force|title=Bi-National Electricity Transmission Opportunities for Arizona and Sonora|url=https://www.azmc.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/6-14-13_Bi-NatlTF-Eng-WEB.pdf|website=azmc.org|accessdate=June 14, 2013}}</ref> The Governor's office led a 19-member task force and held meetings in Hermosillo, Sonora and Nogales, Arizona to complete this assessment. The Task Force formed international contacts for future bi-national electricity transmission projects.

=== Military affairs ===

As governor, Brewer pushed for keeping Arizona military bases open.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Phoenix Business Journal Staff|title=Arizona Gov.

Brewer also granted in-state student status for the purposes of tuition at any Arizona public university or community college to any person honorably discharged from the US Armed Forces. Additionally, she allowed children of active duty military parents to qualify for Empowerment Scholarship Accounts.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Office of the Governor / Arizona Dept. of Education|title=Arizona to Launch Website to Assist Students of Military Families|url=http://www.azed.gov/public-relations/files/2014/07/061714-militaryed-website.pdf |website=azed.gov|accessdate=April 10, 2015}}</ref>  She also extended professional licensing to include military experience.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Longdon|first1=Matthew|title=Law will apply military experience to professional licenses |url=http://cronkitenewsonline.com/2013/05/law-will-apply-military-experience-to-professional-licenses/ |website=cronkitenewsonline.com|accessdate=April 10, 2015}}</ref>

=== Judicial appointments ===

During Brewer's time as governor, she filled a number of vacancies in the courts.  She appointed three State Supreme Court judges, [[Ann Timmer]], [[John Pelander]], and [[Robert M. Brutinel]], all Republicans.  She also appointed a number of Superior and Appellate Court judges.  She was criticized for promoting judges primarily from the Republican Party.<ref name="kifer">{{cite news|first=James |last=Kifer|title=Brewer fills Arizona courts with Republican judges |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20150411174825/http://archive.azcentral.com/arizonarepublic/news/articles/20120912brewer-fills-arizona-courts-republican-judges.html|url=http://archive.azcentral.com/arizonarepublic/news/articles/20120912brewer-fills-arizona-courts-republican-judges.html |archivedate=April 11, 2015|date=September 28, 2012|newspaper=Arizona Republic|accessdate=April 11, 2015}}</ref>

===Same-sex marriage and domestic partnership===
Brewer supported [[Arizona Proposition 107 (2006)|Arizona Proposition 107]], which would have defined marriage as between a man and a woman.<ref>{{cite news |author=La Monica Everett-haynes|url=http://tucsoncitizen.com/morgue/2006/10/24/30309-proposition-107-protecting-marriage-or-denying-benefits |title=Proposition 107: Protecting marriage or denying benefits? |newspaper=Tucson Citizen |date=October 24, 2006 |accessdate=July 19, 2013}}</ref> This 2006 referendum, which would have prevented both [[same-sex marriage]] and [[civil union]]s in the state, did not pass – the first time U.S. voters rejected an attempt to ban same-sex marriage. However, in 2008, [[Arizona Proposition 102 (2008)|another proposition]] that banned same sex marriage (but not civil unions) passed.

Brewer signed a law repealing legislation put into place by former governor [[Janet Napolitano]], which had granted domestic partners of state employees the ability to be considered as "dependents", similar to the way married spouses are handled.<ref>{{cite web |author=Andy Towle |url=http://www.towleroad.com/2009/09/arizona-governor-takes-away-state-domestic-partner-benefits-says-god-has-placed-me-in-this-powerful-.html |title=Arizona Governor Takes Away State Domestic Partner Benefits Says 'God Has Placed Me in This Powerful Position' |publisher=Towleroad |work=Arizona Daily Star |date=September 18, 2009 |accessdate=June 4, 2010}}</ref>

According to an editorial in the ''Arizona Daily Star'' on October 13, 2009, the Department of Administration in Arizona "stated that about 800 state employees are affected and that the cost to insure domestic partners is about $3 million of the $625 million the state spends on benefits".<ref name="azstar">{{cite news |url=http://azstarnet.com/news/local/education/college/article_4c1553a8-444d-5d9d-b155-adb85314aaab.html |title=State staff gets year before partners lose benefits |newspaper=Arizona Daily Star |last=Pallack |first=Beck |date=October 13, 2009 |accessdate=June 4, 2010}}</ref> However, the state was giving those employees another year of coverage, due to legal necessity: "A legal review determined existing contracts with state employees will be honored."<ref name="azstar"/>

A federal lawsuit, ''[[Diaz v. Brewer]]'', formerly ''Collins v. Brewer'', challenging Brewer's action is being heard in federal court. The plaintiffs, represented by [[Lambda Legal]], a [[LGBT]] rights advocacy group, asked for summary judgment based on due process and equal protection claims. On July 23, 2010, U.S. District Judge [[John W. Sedwick]] denied the due process claim, but based on the equal protection claim he issued a temporary injunction blocking enforcement of the law pending a trial.<ref>{{cite news

|accessdate=July 25, 2010|title=Judge blocks Arizona law on domestic-partner benefits |author=Casey Newton|date=July 23, 2010 |newspaper=[[The Arizona Republic]]}}</ref> Brewer appealed the decision to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]], which sided with Sedwick and ruled against her. The state appealed to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]], which denied the appeal, letting the Ninth Circuit ruling stand.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://lezgetreal.com/2010/08/arizona-to-appeal-same-sex-health-benefits-ruling/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170821115917/http://lezgetreal.com/2010/08/arizona-to-appeal-same-sex-health-benefits-ruling/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=August 21, 2017 |title=Arizona To Appeal Same-Sex Health Benefits Ruling |publisher=Lez Get Real |date=August 11, 2010 |accessdate=August 29, 2010 }}</ref>
