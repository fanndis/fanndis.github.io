'''Illinois''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=en-us-Illinois.ogg|ˌ|ɪ|l|ə|ˈ|n|ɔɪ}} {{respell|IL|ə|NOY|'}}) is a [[U.S. state|state]] in the [[Midwestern United States|Midwestern]] and [[Great Lakes region]]s of the [[United States]]. It has the [[List of U.S. states and territories by GDP|fifth largest gross domestic product (GDP)]],
[[List of U.S. states and territories by population|the sixth largest]] population, and the [[List of U.S. states and territories by area|25th largest land area]] of all U.S. states.

The [[Port of Chicago]] connects the state to international ports via two main routes: from the [[Great Lakes]], via the [[Saint Lawrence Seaway]], to the [[Atlantic Ocean]] and from the [[Great Lakes]] to the [[Mississippi River]], via the [[Illinois River]], through the [[Illinois Waterway]]. The Mississippi River, the [[Ohio River]], and the [[Wabash River]] form parts of the boundaries of Illinois. For decades, Chicago's [[O'Hare International Airport]] has been ranked as one of the world's busiest airports. Illinois has long had a reputation as a [[bellwether]] both in [[Will it play in Peoria?|social and cultural terms]]<ref name="so" /> and, through the 1980s, in [[swing states|politics]].

The capital of Illinois is [[Springfield, Illinois|Springfield]], which is located in the central part of the state. Although today Illinois's largest population center is in its northeast, the state's European population grew first in the west as the French settled lands near the Mississippi River, when the region was known as [[Illinois Country]] and was part of [[New France]]. Following the [[American Revolutionary War]], American settlers began arriving from [[Kentucky]] in the 1780s via the Ohio River, and the population grew from south to north. In 1818, Illinois achieved [[List of U.S. states by date of admission to the Union|statehood]]. Following increased commercial activity in the Great Lakes after the construction of the [[Erie Canal]], Chicago was incorporated in the 1830s on the banks of the [[Chicago River]] at one of the few natural harbors on the southern section of [[Lake Michigan]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.chipublib.org/digital/lake/CFDHarbor.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071226002320/http://www.chipublib.org/digital/lake/CFDHarbor.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=December 26, 2007|title=What did Chicago look like in the early 1830s?|date=May 16, 2008|access-date=October 20, 2007}}</ref> [[John Deere (inventor)|John Deere]]'s invention of the self-scouring [[plough|steel plow]] turned Illinois's rich [[prairie]] into some of the world's most productive and valuable farmland, attracting [[immigrant]] farmers from [[German American|Germany]] and [[Swedish American|Sweden]]. The [[Illinois and Michigan Canal]] (1848) made transportation between the Great Lakes and the Mississippi River valley faster and cheaper, and new railroads carried immigrants to new homes in the country's west and shipped commodity crops to the nation's east.

By 1900, the growth of industrial jobs in the northern cities and [[coal]] mining in the central and southern areas attracted immigrants from [[Eastern Europe|Eastern]] and Southern Europe. Illinois was an important manufacturing center during both world wars. The [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] from the South established a [[History of African Americans in Chicago|large community]] of African Americans in the state, including Chicago, who founded the city's famous [[jazz]] and [[blues]] cultures.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/665.html |title=Jazz |website=Encyclopedia of Chicago |accessdate=May 19, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120504032657/http://encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/665.html |archive-date=May 4, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/151.html|title=Blues|website=Encyclopedia of Chicago|accessdate=May 19, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120517114028/http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/151.html|archive-date=May 17, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> Chicago, the center of the [[Chicago Metropolitan Area]], is now recognized as a [[global city]].

==Etymology==

{{See also|Illinois Confederation|List of counties in Illinois}}

"Illinois" is the modern spelling for the early [[French language|French]] [[Catholicism|Catholic]] [[Missionary|missionaries]] and explorers' name for the [[Illinois Confederation|Illinois]] [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], a name that was spelled in many different ways in the early records.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.illinoisprairie.info/Eriniouaj.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=October 23, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100623234945/http://www.illinoisprairie.info/Eriniouaj.htm |archivedate=June 23, 2010 }}</ref>

American scholars previously thought the name "Illinois" meant "man" or "men" in the [[Miami-Illinois language]], with the original ''iliniwek'' transformed via French into Illinois.<ref>{{cite book |last= Hodge |first= Frederick Webb |authorlink= Frederick Webb Hodge |title= Handbook of American Indians north of Mexico, Volume 1 |year= 1911 |publisher=Smithsonian Institution, Bureau of American Ethnology |oclc= 26478613 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=ze4YAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA597 |page= 597}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last= Stewart |first= George R. |authorlink= George R.

The name ''[[Illiniwek]]'' has also been said to mean "tribe of superior men",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.illinois.gov/facts/symbols.cfm |title=Illinois Symbols |accessdate=April 20, 2006 |publisher=State of Illinois |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060415195518/http://www.illinois.gov/facts/symbols.cfm |archivedate=April 15, 2006 }}</ref> which is a [[false etymology]]. The name "Illinois" derives from the Miami-Illinois verb ''irenwe·wa''—"he speaks the regular way". This was taken into the [[Ojibwe language]], perhaps in the [[Ottawa dialect]], and modified into ''ilinwe·'' (pluralized as ''ilinwe·k''). The French borrowed these forms, changing the /we/ ending to spell it as ''-ois'', a [[transliteration]] for its pronunciation in French of that time. The current spelling form, ''Illinois'', began to appear in the early 1670s, when French colonists had settled in the western area. The Illinois's name for themselves, as attested in all three of the French missionary-period dictionaries of Illinois, was ''[[Inoka]]'', of unknown meaning and unrelated to the other terms.<ref>{{cite book |last= Callary |first= Edward |title= Place Names of Illinois |year= 2008 |publisher=University of Illinois Press |isbn= 978-0-252-03356-8 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=ZvHgwa-XImcC&pg=PA169 |page= 169}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last= Costa|first= David J.|date= January 2007|title= Three American Placenames: Illinois|journal= Society for the Study of the Indigenous Languages of the Americas Newsletter|volume= 25|issue= 4|pages= 9–12|issn= 1046-4476|url= http://myaamia.strackattack.com/OtherFiles/CostaNewsletter.pdf#page=9|accessdate= May 29, 2011|url-status= dead|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110716151840/http://myaamia.strackattack.com/OtherFiles/CostaNewsletter.pdf#page=9|archivedate= July 16, 2011|df= mdy-all}}</ref>

==History==

{{Main|History of Illinois}}

=== Geologic history ===
{{Main|Geology of Illinois}}
During the early part of the [[Paleozoic Era]], the area that would one day become Illinois was submerged beneath a shallow sea and located near the Equator. Diverse marine life lived at this time, including [[Trilobite|trilobites]], [[Brachiopod|brachiopods]], and [[Crinoid|crinoids]]. Changing environmental conditions led to the formation of large [[Coal forest|coal swamps]] in the [[Carboniferous]].

Illinois was above sea level for at least part of the [[Mesozoic]], but by its end was again submerged by the [[Western Interior Seaway]]. This receded by the [[Eocene|Eocene Epoch]].

During the [[Pleistocene Epoch]], vast ice sheets covered much of Illinois, with only the [[Driftless Area]] remaining exposed. These [[Glacier|glaciers]] carved the basin of [[Lake Michigan]] and left behind traces of ancient glacial lakes and [[Moraine|moraines]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Willman|first=Harold Bowen|last2=Atherton|first2=Elwood|last3=Buschbach|first3=T.

French explorers [[Jacques Marquette]] and [[Louis Jolliet]] explored the [[Illinois River]] in 1673. Marquette soon after founded a mission at the [[Grand Village of the Illinois]] in [[Illinois Country]]. In 1680, French explorers under [[René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle]] and [[Henri de Tonti]] constructed a fort at the site of present-day [[Peoria, Illinois|Peoria]], and in 1682, a fort atop [[Starved Rock]] in today's Starved Rock State Park. French Empire [[Canadiens]] came south to settle particularly along the Mississippi River, and Illinois was part of first [[New France]], and then of [[La Louisiane]] until 1763, when it passed to the British with their defeat of France in the [[Seven Years' War]]. The small French settlements continued, although many French migrated west to [[Ste. Genevieve, Missouri|Ste. Genevieve]] and [[St. Louis, Missouri]], to evade British rule.<ref name="Biles"/>

A few British soldiers were posted in Illinois, but few British or American settlers moved there, as the Crown made it part of the territory reserved for Indians west of the Appalachians, and then part of the [[Province of Quebec (1763–1791)|British Province of Quebec]]. In 1778, [[George Rogers Clark]] claimed [[Illinois County]] for [[Colony of Virginia|Virginia]]. In a compromise, Virginia (and other states that made various claims) ceded the area to the new United States in the 1780s and it became part of the [[Northwest Territory]], administered by the federal government and later organized as states.<ref name="Biles">{{cite book |last=Biles |first=Roger |title= Illinois: A History of the Land and its People|year= 2005|publisher=Northern Illinois University Press|location= DeKalb|isbn=978-0-87580-349-4}}</ref>

====Prior to statehood====

The [[Illinois-Wabash Company]] was an early claimant to much of Illinois. The [[Illinois Territory]] was created on February 3, 1809, with its capital at [[Kaskaskia, Illinois|Kaskaskia]], an early French settlement.

During the discussions leading up to Illinois's [[admission to the Union]], the proposed northern boundary of the state was moved twice.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sancohis.org/presentations/Illinois%20From%20Territory%20to%20State.htm |title=Full Remarks from Dave M |publisher=Sancohis.org |date=March 16, 2010 |accessdate=February 7, 2011}}{{Dead link|date=February 2012}}</ref> The original provisions of the [[Northwest Ordinance]] had specified a boundary that would have been tangent to the southern tip of Lake Michigan. Such a boundary would have left Illinois with no shoreline on Lake Michigan at all. However, as Indiana had successfully been granted a {{Convert|10|mi|adj=on}} northern extension of its boundary to provide it with a usable lakefront, the original bill for Illinois statehood, submitted to Congress on January 23, 1818, stipulated a northern border at the same latitude as Indiana's, which is defined as 10 miles north of the southernmost extremity of Lake Michigan. However, the Illinois delegate, [[Nathaniel Pope]], wanted more, and lobbied to have the boundary moved further north. The final bill passed by Congress included an amendment to shift the border to 42° 30' north, which is approximately {{convert|51|mi}} north of the Indiana northern border. This shift added {{convert|8500|sqmi|4=-2}} to the state, including the [[lead mining]] region near [[Galena, Illinois|Galena]]. More importantly, it added nearly 50 miles of Lake Michigan shoreline and the Chicago River. Pope and others envisioned a canal that would connect the Chicago and Illinois rivers and thus connect the Great Lakes to the Mississippi.

====The State of Illinois prior to the Civil War====

[[File:United States 1818-12-1819-03.png|thumb|In 1818, Illinois became the 21st U.S. state. The southern portion of [[Illinois Territory]] was admitted as the state of Illinois, and the rest was joined to [[Michigan Territory]].]]

In 1818, Illinois became the 21st U.S. state. The capital remained at Kaskaskia, headquartered in a small building rented by the state. In 1819, [[Vandalia, Illinois|Vandalia]] became the capital, and over the next 18 years, three separate buildings were built to serve successively as the capitol building. In 1837, the state legislators representing [[Sangamon County]], under the leadership of state representative Abraham Lincoln, succeeded in having the capital moved to [[Springfield, Illinois|Springfield]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://abrahamlincolnsclassroom.org/Library/newsletter.asp?ID=137&CRLI=193 |title=Abraham Lincoln and Springfield—Abraham Lincoln's Classroom |publisher=Abrahamlincolnsclassroom.org |accessdate=February 7, 2011 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/682r7LEev?url=http://abrahamlincolnsclassroom.org/Library/newsletter.asp?ID=137&CRLI=193 |archive-date=May 30, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> where a [[Old State Capitol State Historic Site (Illinois)|fifth capitol]] building was constructed. A [[Illinois State Capitol|sixth capitol]] building was erected in 1867, which continues to serve as the Illinois capitol today.

Though it was ostensibly a "[[Slave and free states|free state]]", there was nonetheless [[History of slavery in Illinois|slavery in Illinois]]. The ethnic French had owned black slaves since the 1720s, and American settlers had already brought slaves into the area from Kentucky. Slavery was nominally banned by the Northwest Ordinance, but that was not enforced for those already holding slaves. When Illinois became a sovereign state in 1818, the Ordinance no longer applied, and about 900 slaves were held in the state.

The winter of 1830–1831 is called the "Winter of the Deep Snow"; a sudden, deep snowfall blanketed the state, making travel impossible for the rest of the winter, and many travelers perished. Several severe winters followed, including the "Winter of the Sudden Freeze". On December 20, 1836, a fast-moving cold front passed through, freezing puddles in minutes and killing many travelers who could not reach shelter. The adverse weather resulted in crop failures in the northern part of the state. The southern part of the state shipped food north, and this may have contributed to its name: "[[Southern Illinois|Little Egypt]]", after the [[Bible|Biblical]] story of Joseph in Egypt supplying grain to his brothers.<ref>Duff, Judge Andrew D.

In 1832, the [[Black Hawk War]] was fought in Illinois and present-day [[Wisconsin]] between the United States and the [[Sauk people|Sauk]], [[Meskwaki|Fox (Meskwaki)]], and [[Kickapoo people|Kickapoo]] Indian tribes. It represents the end of Indian resistance to white settlement in the Chicago region.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |url = http://encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/141.html |title = Black Hawk War |encyclopedia = Encyclopedia of Chicago |accessdate = August 10, 2012 |date = |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120822134545/http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/141.html |archivedate = August 22, 2012 |url-status = dead }}</ref> The Indians had been forced to leave their homes and move to [[Iowa]] in 1831; when they attempted to return, they were attacked and eventually defeated by U.S. militia.

By 1839, the [[Latter Day Saints]] had founded a [[utopian]] city called [[Nauvoo, Illinois|Nauvoo]]. Located in [[Hancock County, Illinois|Hancock County]] along the Mississippi River, Nauvoo flourished, and soon rivaled Chicago for the position of the state's largest city. But in 1844, the [[Latter Day Saint movement]] founder [[Joseph Smith]] [[Death of Joseph Smith|was killed]] in the [[Carthage Jail]], about 30 miles away from Nauvoo. Following a [[succession crisis (Latter Day Saints)]], [[Brigham Young]] led most Latter Day Saints out of Illinois in a [[Mormon pioneers|mass exodus]] to present-day [[Utah]]; after close to six years of rapid development, Nauvoo rapidly declined afterward.

After it was established in 1833, Chicago gained prominence as a [[Great Lakes]] port, and then as an [[Illinois and Michigan Canal]] port after 1848, and as a rail hub soon afterward. By 1857, Chicago was Illinois's largest city.<ref name="Biles"/> With the tremendous growth of mines and factories in the state in the 19th century, Illinois was the ground for the formation of [[labor unions in the United States]].

In 1847, after lobbying by [[Dorothea Dix|Dorothea L. Dix]], Illinois became one of the first states to establish a system of state-supported treatment of mental illness and disabilities, replacing local [[almshouse]]s. Dix came into this effort after having met J. O. King, a [[Jacksonville, Illinois]] businessman, who invited her to Illinois, where he had been working to build an asylum for the insane. With the lobbying expertise of Dix, plans for the Jacksonville State Hospital (now known as the [[Jacksonville Developmental Center]]) were signed into law on March 1, 1847.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Norbury|first1=Frank|title=Dorothea Dix and the Founding of Illinois's First Mental Hospital|journal=Journal of the Illinois State Historical Society|date=Spring 1999|volume=92|issue=1|pages=13–29|jstor=40193299}}</ref>

During the [[American Civil War]], Illinois ranked fourth in men who served (more than 250,000) in the [[Union Army]], a figure surpassed by only New York, [[Pennsylvania]], and [[Ohio]]. Beginning with President [[Abraham Lincoln]]'s first call for troops and continuing throughout the war, Illinois mustered 150 infantry regiments, which were numbered from the 7th to the 156th regiments. Seventeen cavalry regiments were also gathered, as well as two light artillery regiments.<ref>[http://www.illinoiscivilwar.org/units_num.html "Illinois Infantry, Cavalry, and Artillery Units"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180818150741/http://www.illinoiscivilwar.org/units_num.html |date=August 18, 2018 }}, Illinois in the Civil War, Retrieved November 26, 2006</ref> The town of [[Cairo, Illinois|Cairo]], at the southern tip of the state at the confluence of the Mississippi and Ohio Rivers, served as a strategically important supply base and training center for the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] army.

During the Civil War, and more so afterwards, Chicago's population skyrocketed, which increased its prominence. The [[Pullman Strike]] and [[Haymarket affair|Haymarket Riot]], in particular, greatly influenced the development of the American [[labour movement|labor movement]]. From Sunday, October 8, 1871, until Tuesday, October 10, 1871, the [[Great Chicago Fire]] burned in downtown Chicago, destroying {{convert|4|sqmi|spell=in}}.<ref>Roland Tweet, ''Miss Gale's Books: The Beginnings of the Rock Island Public Library'', (Rock Island, IL: Rock Island Public Library, 1997), 15.</ref>

===20th century===

At the turn of the 20th century, Illinois had a population of nearly 5&nbsp;million. Many people from other parts of the country were attracted to the state by employment caused by the expanding industrial base. Whites were 98% of the state's population.<ref name="census">{{cite web|title=Illinois—Race and Hispanic Origin: 1800 to 1990 |publisher=U.S. Census Bureau |url=https://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0056/twps0056.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725044857/http://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0056/twps0056.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=July 25, 2008 }}</ref> Bolstered by continued [[History of immigration to the United States|immigration from southern and eastern Europe]], and by the African-American [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] from the South, Illinois grew and emerged as one of the most important states in the union. By the end of the century, the population had reached 12.4&nbsp;million.

The [[Century of Progress]] [[World's fair]] was held at Chicago in 1933. Oil strikes in [[Marion County, Illinois|Marion County]] and [[Crawford County, Illinois|Crawford County]] led to a boom in 1937, and by 1939, Illinois ranked fourth in U.S. oil production. Illinois manufactured 6.1 percent of total United States military armaments produced during [[World War&nbsp;II]], ranking seventh among the 48 states.<ref>[[Whiz Kids (Department of Defense)|Peck, Merton J.]] & [[Frederic M. Scherer|Scherer, Frederic M.]] ''The Weapons Acquisition Process: An Economic Analysis'' (1962) [[Harvard Business School]] p.111</ref> Chicago became an ocean port with the opening of the [[Saint Lawrence Seaway]] in 1959. The seaway and the [[Illinois Waterway]] connected Chicago to both the Mississippi River and the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. In 1960, [[Ray Kroc]] opened the first [[McDonald's]] franchise in [[Des Plaines, Illinois|Des Plaines]] (which still exists as a museum, with a working McDonald's across the street).

Illinois had a prominent role in the emergence of the [[nuclear age]]. In 1942, as part of the [[Manhattan Project]], the [[Chicago Pile-1|University of Chicago]] conducted the first sustained [[nuclear chain reaction]]. In 1957, [[Argonne National Laboratory]], near [[Chicago]], activated the first experimental nuclear power generating system in the United States. By 1960, the first privately financed nuclear plant in the United States, [[Dresden Nuclear Power Plant|Dresden 1]], was dedicated near [[Morris, Illinois|Morris]]. In 1967, [[Fermilab]], a national nuclear research facility near [[Batavia, Illinois|Batavia]], opened a [[particle accelerator]], which was the world's largest for over 40 years. With eleven plants currently operating, Illinois leads all states in the amount of electricity generated from nuclear power.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.comed.com/sites/PartnersBusiness/Documents/EconomicDevelopmentFactSheet.pdf |title=ComEd and Electricity Related Messages for Economic Development |accessdate=February 7, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708180209/https://www.comed.com/sites/PartnersBusiness/Documents/EconomicDevelopmentFactSheet.pdf |archivedate=July 8, 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.comed.com/Documents/about-us/economic-development/ComEd_and_Electricity_Related_EconDev_Messages_-_January_2012.pdf |title=Home &#124; ComEd—An Exelon Company |publisher=ComEd |accessdate=February 27, 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130914144313/https://www.comed.com/Documents/about-us/economic-development/ComEd_and_Electricity_Related_EconDev_Messages_-_January_2012.pdf |archivedate=September 14, 2013 }}</ref>

==Geography==

{{Main|Geography of Illinois}}
{{Further|List of ecoregions in Illinois}}
[[File:National-atlas-illinois.png|upright=1.6|thumb|A map of the state of Illinois, showing major cities, roads, rivers and lakes]]

Illinois is located in the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest region]] of the United States and is one of the eight states and Ontario, Canada, in the [[Great Lakes region (North America)|Great Lakes region]] of North America.

===Boundaries===

Illinois's eastern border with [[Indiana]] consists of a north–south line at 87° 31′ 30″ west longitude in [[Lake Michigan]] at the north, to the [[Wabash River]] in the south above [[Vincennes, Indiana|Post Vincennes]]. The Wabash River continues as the eastern/southeastern border with Indiana until the Wabash enters the [[Ohio River]]. This marks the beginning of Illinois's southern border with [[Kentucky]], which runs along the northern shoreline of the Ohio River.<ref>[[Wikisource]]. [[s:Illinois Constitution of 1818|Illinois Constitution of 1818]].</ref> Most of the western border with [[Missouri]] and [[Iowa]] is the [[Mississippi River]]; Kaskaskia is an [[exclave]] of Illinois, lying west of the Mississippi and reachable only from Missouri. The state's northern border with [[Wisconsin]] is fixed at 42° 30′ north latitude. The northeastern border of Illinois lies in [[Lake Michigan]], within which Illinois shares a water boundary with the state of [[Michigan]], as well as Wisconsin and Indiana.<ref name="Nelson">{{cite book |editor=Nelson, Ronald E. |title=Illinois: Land and Life in the Prairie State|origyear= |url= |edition= |year=1978|publisher=Kendall/Hunt|location= Dubuque, Iowa|isbn=978-0-8403-1831-2|oclc= |chapter= |chapterurl= |quote= }}</ref>

===Topography===

[[File:Charles Mound, Illinois.JPG|thumb|upright=1.25|Charles Mound, the highest natural point in Illinois at 1,235 feet, is located in the [[Driftless Area]] in the northwestern part of the state.]]

Though Illinois lies entirely in the [[Interior Plains]], it does have some minor variation in its elevation. In extreme northwestern Illinois, the [[Driftless Area]], a region of unglaciated and therefore higher and more rugged topography, occupies a small part of the state. [[Southern Illinois]] includes the hilly areas around the [[Shawnee National Forest]].

[[Charles Mound]], located in the Driftless region, has the state's highest natural elevation above sea level at {{convert|1235|ft}}. Other highlands include the [[Shawnee Hills]] in the south, and there is varying topography along its rivers; the [[Illinois River]] bisects the state northeast to southwest. The floodplain on the Mississippi River from [[Alton, Illinois|Alton]] to the [[Kaskaskia River]] is known as the [[American Bottom]].

===Divisions===

Illinois has three major geographical divisions. [[Northern Illinois]] is dominated by [[Chicago metropolitan area]], or Chicagoland, which is the city of Chicago and its suburbs, and the adjoining exurban area into which the metropolis is expanding. As defined by the federal government, the Chicago metro area includes several counties in Illinois, [[Indiana]], and [[Wisconsin]], and has a population of over 9.8&nbsp;million. Chicago itself is a cosmopolitan city, densely populated, industrialized, the transportation hub of the nation, and settled by a wide variety of ethnic groups. The city of [[Rockford, Illinois|Rockford]], Illinois's third-largest city and center of the state's fourth largest metropolitan area, sits along Interstates [[Interstate 39|39]] and [[Interstate 90|90]] some {{convert|75|mi|km}} northwest of Chicago. The [[Quad Cities]] region, located along the [[Mississippi River]] in northern Illinois, had a population of 381,342 in 2011.

The midsection of Illinois is the second major division, called [[Central Illinois]]. It is an area of mainly [[prairie]] and known as the Heart of Illinois. It is characterized by small towns and medium–small cities. The western section (west of the Illinois River) was originally part of the [[Military Tract of 1812]] and forms the conspicuous western bulge of the state. Agriculture, particularly [[maize|corn]] and [[soybean]]s, as well as educational institutions and manufacturing centers, figure prominently in Central Illinois. Cities include [[Peoria, Illinois|Peoria]]; [[Springfield, Illinois|Springfield]], the state capital; [[Quincy, Illinois|Quincy]]; [[Decatur, Illinois|Decatur]]; [[Bloomington-Normal, Illinois|Bloomington-Normal]]; and [[Champaign, Illinois|Champaign]]-[[Urbana, Illinois|Urbana]].<ref name="Nelson"/>

The third division is [[Southern Illinois]], comprising the area south of [[U.S. Route 50 in Illinois|U.S. Route 50]], including [[Southern Illinois|Little Egypt]], near the juncture of the [[Mississippi River]] and [[Ohio River]]. Southern Illinois is the site of the ancient city of [[Cahokia]], as well as the site of the first state capital at [[Kaskaskia, Illinois|Kaskaskia]], which today is separated from the rest of the state by the Mississippi River.<ref name="Nelson"/><ref name="Horsley">{{cite book |last=Horsley |first=A. Doyne |title=Illinois: A Geography |year=1986 |publisher=Westview Press|location= Boulder|isbn=978-0-86531-522-8 }}</ref> This region has a somewhat warmer winter climate, different variety of crops (including some cotton farming in the past), more rugged topography (due to the area remaining unglaciated during the [[Illinoian (stage)|Illinoian Stage]], unlike most of the rest of the state), as well as small-scale oil deposits and coal mining. The Illinois suburbs of [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]], such as [[East St. Louis]], are located in this region, and collectively, they are known as the [[Metro-East]]. The other somewhat significant concentration of population in Southern Illinois is the Carbondale-Marion-Herrin, Illinois Combined Statistical Area centered on [[Carbondale, Illinois|Carbondale]] and [[Marion, Illinois|Marion]], a two-county area that is home to 123,272 residents.<ref name="Nelson"/> A portion of southeastern Illinois is part of the extended [[Evansville, Indiana]], Metro Area, locally referred to as the Tri-State with Indiana and Kentucky. Seven Illinois counties are in the area.

In addition to these three, largely latitudinally defined divisions, all of the region outside the Chicago Metropolitan area is often called "[[Downstate Illinois|downstate]]" Illinois. This term is flexible, but is generally meant to mean everything outside the influence of the Chicago area. Thus, some cities in ''Northern'' Illinois, such as [[DeKalb, Illinois|DeKalb]], which is west of Chicago, and [[Rockford, Illinois|Rockford]]—which is actually north of Chicago—are sometimes incorrectly considered to be 'downstate'.

[[File:IL koppen.svg|upright=0.9|thumb|[[Köppen climate classification|Köppen climate types]] of Illinois]]

Illinois has a climate that varies widely throughout the year. Because of its nearly 400-mile distance between its northernmost and southernmost extremes, as well as its mid-continental situation, most of Illinois has a [[humid continental climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Dfa''), with hot, humid summers and cold winters. The southern part of the state, from about [[Carbondale, Illinois|Carbondale]] southward, has a [[humid subtropical climate]] (Koppen ''Cfa''), with more moderate winters.

====Christianity====

Roman Catholics constitute the single largest religious denomination in Illinois; they are heavily concentrated in and around Chicago, and account for nearly 30% of the state's population.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.statemaster.com/red/graph/peo_rom_cat_per_of_cat-people-roman-catholicism-percentage-catholics&int=-1&id=IL |title=Roman Catholicism percentage of Catholics statistics—states compared—People data on StateMaster |publisher=Statemaster.com |date=May 15, 2012 |accessdate=May 19, 2012 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/682rOuw8p?url=http://www.statemaster.com/red/graph/peo_rom_cat_per_of_cat-people-roman-catholicism-percentage-catholics%26int%3D-1%26id%3DIL |archive-date=May 30, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> However, taken together ''as a group'', the various Protestant denominations comprise a greater percentage of the state's population than do Catholics. In 2010 Catholics in Illinois numbered 3,648,907. The largest Protestant denominations were the [[United Methodist Church]] with 314,461, and the [[Southern Baptist Convention]], with 283,519 members. Illinois has one of the largest concentrations of [[Missouri Synod Lutherans]] in the United States.

Illinois played an important role in the early [[Latter Day Saint movement]], with [[Nauvoo, Illinois]], becoming a gathering place for Mormons in the early 1840s. Nauvoo was the location of the [[Succession crisis (Latter Day Saints)|succession crisis]], which led to the separation of the Mormon movement into [[List of denominations in the Latter Day Saint movement|several Latter Day Saint sects]]. [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], the largest of the sects to emerge from the Mormon schism, has more than 55,000 adherents in Illinois today.<ref>[https://newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/facts-and-statistics/state/illinois "Facts and Statistics"], ''[[Church News]]'', 2020.

===Services===

By the early 2000s, Illinois's economy had moved toward a dependence on high-value-added services, such as financial trading, higher education, law, logistics, and medicine. In some cases, these services clustered around institutions that hearkened back to Illinois's earlier economies. For example, the [[Chicago Mercantile Exchange]], a trading exchange for global [[derivative (finance)|derivatives]], had begun its life as an agricultural [[futures exchange|futures market]]. Other important non-manufacturing industries include publishing, tourism, and energy production and distribution.

===Investments===

Venture capitalists funded a total of approximately $62&nbsp;billion in the U.S. economy in 2016. Of this amount, Illinois-based companies received approximately $1.1&nbsp;billion. Similarly, in FY 2016, the federal government spent $461&nbsp;billion on contracts in the U.S. Of this amount, Illinois-based companies received approximately $8.7&nbsp;billion.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://medium.com/launchdream/illinois-want-to-be-a-pioneer-in-growing-companies-jobs-and-competitiveness-f52141a9bddf|title=Illinois—Want to be a Pioneer in Growing Companies, Jobs, and Competitiveness?|last=Pradhan|first=Nitin|date=August 28, 2017|website=Medium|access-date=September 4, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170905003925/https://medium.com/launchdream/illinois-want-to-be-a-pioneer-in-growing-companies-jobs-and-competitiveness-f52141a9bddf|archive-date=September 5, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Energy===

{{See also|List of power stations in Illinois|Solar power in Illinois}}

Illinois is a net importer of fuels for energy, despite large coal resources and some minor oil production. Illinois exports electricity, ranking fifth among states in electricity production and seventh in electricity consumption.<ref name="finley">"[http://www.isgs.uiuc.edu/maps-data-pub/publications/energy01/globalm.shtml Illinois in the Global Energy Marketplace]" {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517110354/http://www.isgs.uiuc.edu/maps-data-pub/publications/energy01/globalm.shtml |date=May 17, 2008 }}, [[Robert Finley]], 2001.

====Coal====

The coal industry of Illinois has its origins in the middle 19th century, when entrepreneurs such as [[Jacob Loose]] discovered coal in locations such as [[Sangamon County]]. [[Jacob Bunn]] contributed to the development of the Illinois coal industry, and was a founder and owner of the [[Western Coal & Mining Company]] of Illinois. About 68% of Illinois has coal-bearing strata of the [[Pennsylvanian (geology)|Pennsylvanian]] geologic period. According to the Illinois State Geological Survey, 211&nbsp;billion tons of [[bituminous coal]] are estimated to lie under the surface, having a total heating value greater than the estimated oil deposits in the [[Arabian Peninsula]].<ref>Illinois State Geological Survey. [http://www.isgs.illinois.edu/research/coal/illinois-coal.shtml Coal in Illinois] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120212180840/http://www.isgs.illinois.edu/research/coal/illinois-coal.shtml |date=February 12, 2012 }} Retrieved December 4, 2008.</ref> However, this coal has a high [[sulfur]] content, which causes [[acid rain]], unless special equipment is used to reduce [[sulfur dioxide]] [[air pollution|emissions]].<ref name="Nelson"/><ref name="Biles"/><ref name="Horsley"/> Many Illinois [[Power station|power plants]] are not equipped to burn high-sulfur coal. In 1999, Illinois produced 40.4&nbsp;million tons of coal, but only 17&nbsp;million tons (42%) of Illinois coal was consumed in Illinois. Most of the coal produced in Illinois is exported to other states and countries. In 2008, Illinois exported three million tons of coal, and was projected to export nine million in 2011, as demand for energy grows in places such as China, India, and elsewhere in Asia and Europe.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ildceo.net/NR/rdonlyres/EA15E8A9-E0BD-468A-A308-BE58E93D0C03/0/CoalInIllinois2011.pdf |title=DCEO: Home |publisher=Ildceo.net |accessdate=February 27, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029202930/http://www.ildceo.net/NR/rdonlyres/EA15E8A9-E0BD-468A-A308-BE58E93D0C03/0/CoalInIllinois2011.pdf |archive-date=October 29, 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> {{as of|2010}}, Illinois was ranked third in recoverable coal reserves at producing mines in the nation.<ref name="eia.gov"/> Most of the coal produced in Illinois is exported to other states, while much of the coal burned for power in Illinois (21&nbsp;million tons in 1998) is mined in the [[Powder River Basin]] of [[Wyoming]].<ref name="finley"/>

===State government===

{{Main|Government of Illinois}}

The [[government of Illinois]], under the [[Constitution of Illinois]], has three branches of government: executive, legislative and judicial. The executive branch is split into several statewide elected offices, with the governor as chief executive. Legislative functions are granted to the Illinois General Assembly. The judiciary is composed of the Supreme Court and lower courts.

The [[Illinois General Assembly]] is the state legislature, composed of the 118-member [[Illinois House of Representatives]] and the 59-member [[Illinois Senate]]. The members of the General Assembly are elected at the beginning of each even-numbered year. The ''[[Illinois Compiled Statutes]]'' (ILCS) are the [[codification (law)|codified]] statutes of a general and permanent nature.<ref name="survey">{{cite book|title=Illinois Criminal Law: A Survey of Crimes and Defenses|first1=John F.|last1=Decker|first2=Christopher|last2=Kopacz|year=2012|edition=5th|publisher=[[LexisNexis]]|isbn=978-0-7698-5284-3|url={{Google books|l2I_8OvYAVYC|page=PT24|keywords=|text=|plainurl=yes}}|at=§ 1.01}}</ref><ref name="tapping">{{cite book|title=Tapping State Government Information Sources|page=126|first1=Lori L.|last1=Smith|first2=Daniel C.|last2=Barkley|first3=Daniel C.|last3=Cornwall|first4=Eric W.|last4=Johnson|first5=J.

===History of corruption===

{{Main|Political corruption in Illinois}}

Politics in the state have been infamous for highly visible corruption cases, as well as for crusading reformers, such as governors [[Adlai Stevenson II|Adlai Stevenson]] and [[James R. Thompson]]. In 2006, former governor [[George Ryan]] was convicted of racketeering and bribery, leading to a six-and-a-half-year prison sentence. In 2008, then-Governor [[Rod Blagojevich]] was served with a criminal complaint on corruption charges, stemming from allegations that he conspired to sell the vacated Senate seat left by President [[Barack Obama]] to the highest bidder. Subsequently, on December 7, 2011, [[Rod Blagojevich]] was sentenced to 14 years in prison for those charges, as well as perjury while testifying during the case, totaling 18 convictions. Blagojevich was impeached and convicted by the legislature, resulting in his removal from office. In the late 20th century, Congressman [[Dan Rostenkowski]] was imprisoned for mail fraud; former governor and federal judge [[Otto Kerner, Jr.]] was imprisoned for bribery; Secretary of State [[Paul Powell (politician)|Paul Powell]] was investigated and found to have gained great wealth through bribes, and State Auditor of Public Accounts (Comptroller) [[Orville Hodge]] was imprisoned for embezzlement. In 1912, William Lorimer, the GOP boss of Chicago, was expelled from the U.S. Senate for bribery and in 1921, Governor [[Len Small]] was found to have defrauded the state of a million dollars.<ref name="Biles"/><ref name="Horsley"/><ref>{{cite book |title= Grafters and Goo Goos: corruption and reform in Chicago, 1833–2003|last= Merriner|first= James L.|year= 2004|publisher=Southern Illinois University Press|location= Carbondale|isbn= 978-0-8093-2571-9|oclc= 52720998}}</ref>

===U.S. presidential elections===

{{Main|United States presidential elections in Illinois}}

Illinois has shown a strong presence in presidential elections. Three presidents have claimed Illinois as their political base when running for president: [[Abraham Lincoln]], [[Ulysses S. Grant]], and most recently [[Barack Obama]]. Lincoln was born in [[Kentucky]], but he moved to Illinois at age 21. He served in the [[Illinois General Assembly|General Assembly]] and represented the [[Illinois's 7th congressional district|7th congressional district]] in the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]] before his election to the presidency in 1860. [[Ulysses S. Grant]] was born in [[Ohio]] and had a military career that precluded settling down, but on the eve of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] and approaching middle age, he moved to Illinois and thus utilized the state as his home and political base when running for president. [[Barack Obama]] was born in [[Hawaii]] and made Illinois his home after graduating from [[law school]], and later represented Illinois in the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]]. He then became president in 2008, running as a candidate from his Illinois base.

[[Ronald Reagan]] was born in Illinois, in the city of [[Tampico, Illinois|Tampico]], raised in [[Dixon, Illinois]], and educated at [[Eureka College]], outside [[Peoria, Illinois|Peoria]]. Reagan later moved to [[California]] during his young adulthood. He then became an actor, and later became [[Governor of California|California's Governor]] before being elected president.

[[Hillary Clinton]] was born and raised in the suburbs of Chicago and became the first woman to represent a major political party in the general election of the U.S. presidency. Clinton ran from a platform based in [[New York (state)|New York State]].

===African-American U.S. senators===

[[List of African-American United States Senators|Nine African-Americans]] have served as members of the [[United States Senate]]. Of which three have represented Illinois, the most of any single state: [[Carol Moseley Braun|Carol Moseley-Braun]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://history.house.gov/People/Listing/M/MOSELEY-BRAUN,-Carol-(M001025)/|title=Moseley Braun, Carol|website=History, Art & Archives|publisher=United States House of Representatives|access-date=October 6, 2020}}</ref> [[Barack Obama]],<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.senate.gov/pagelayout/history/h_multi_sections_and_teasers/Photo_Exhibit_African_American_Senators.htm |title=U.S. Senate: Art & History Home |publisher=Senate.gov |accessdate=February 7, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180702035451/https://www.senate.gov/pagelayout/history/h_multi_sections_and_teasers/Photo_Exhibit_African_American_Senators.htm |archive-date=July 2, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref> and [[Roland Burris]], who was appointed to replace Obama after his election to the presidency. Moseley-Braun was the first African-American woman to become a U.S. Senator.

===Political families===

Three families from Illinois have played particularly prominent roles in the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], gaining both statewide and national fame.

====Stevenson====

The [[Stevenson family]], initially rooted in central Illinois and later based in the Chicago metropolitan area, has provided four generations of Illinois officeholders.
* [[Adlai Stevenson I]] (1835–1914) was a Vice President of the United States, as well as a [[Congressman]]
* [[Lewis Stevenson (politician)|Lewis Stevenson]] (1868–1929), son of Adlai, served as [[Illinois Secretary of State]].
* [[Adlai Stevenson II]] (1900–1965), son of Lewis, served as [[Governor of Illinois]] and as the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations; he was also the Democratic party's presidential nominee in [[1952 United States presidential election|1952]] and [[1956 United States presidential election|1956]], losing both elections to [[Dwight Eisenhower]].
* [[Adlai Stevenson III]] (1930–), son of Adlai II, served ten years as a [[United States Senator]].

====Daley====

The [[Daley family]]'s powerbase was in Chicago.
* [[Richard J. Daley]] (1902–1976) served as [[Mayor of Chicago]] from 1955 to his death.
* [[Richard M. Daley]] (1942–), son of Richard J, was Chicago's longest-serving mayor, in office from 1989 to 2011.
* [[William M. Daley]] (1948–), another son of Richard J, is a former [[White House Chief of Staff]] and has served in a variety of appointed positions.

====Pritzker====

The [[Pritzker family]] is based in Chicago and have played important roles in both the private and the public sectors.
* [[Jay Pritzker]] (1922–1999), co-founder of [[Hyatt Hotel]] based in Chicago.
* [[Penny Pritzker]] (born 1959), 38th [[United States Secretary of Commerce]] under President [[Barack Obama]].
* [[J.B. Pritzker]] (born 1965), current and 43rd [[governor of Illinois]] and co-founder of the Pritzker Group.

==Education==
===Illinois State Board of education===

{{Main|Illinois State Board of Education}}

The Illinois State Board of Education (ISBE) is autonomous of the governor and the state legislature, and administers [[public education]] in the state. Local municipalities and their respective [[school district]]s operate individual public schools, but the ISBE audits performance of public schools with the [[Illinois School Report Card]]. The ISBE also makes recommendations to state leaders concerning education spending and policies.

===Primary and secondary schools===

{{See also|List of school districts in Illinois|List of high schools in Illinois}}

Education is compulsory for ages 7–17 in Illinois. Schools are commonly, but not exclusively, divided into three tiers of primary and secondary education: elementary school, [[middle school]] or [[Middle school|junior high school]], and high school. District territories are often complex in structure. Many areas in the state are actually located in ''two'' school districts—one for high school, the other for elementary and middle schools. And such districts do not necessarily share boundaries. A given high school may have several elementary districts that feed into it, yet some of those feeder districts may themselves feed into multiple high school districts.

===Colleges and universities===

{{Mainlist|List of colleges and universities in Illinois}}
[[File:MainLibrary Urbana Illinois 4582.jpg|thumb|The [[Main Library (University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign)|Main Library]] of the [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign]] is home to [[The Rare Book & Manuscript Library (University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign)|the Rare Book & Manuscript Library]].]]

Using the criterion established by [[the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching]], there are eleven "National Universities" in the state. {{As of|2010|8|19}}, six of these rank in the "first tier" (that is, the top quartile) among the top 500 National Universities in the United States, as determined by the ''[[U.S. News & World Report]]'' rankings: the [[University of Chicago]] (3), [[Northwestern University]] (10), the [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign]] (41), [[Loyola University Chicago]] (89), the [[Illinois Institute of Technology]] (108), [[DePaul University]] (123), [[University of Illinois at Chicago]] (129), [[Illinois State University]] (149), [[Southern Illinois University Carbondale]] (153), and [[Northern Illinois University]] (194).<ref name="usnews">{{cite web|url=http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/national-universities-rankings/state+IL|title=Best Colleges 2010—National Universities Rankings|date=August 19, 2009|accessdate=May 31, 2016|website=[[U.S. News & World Report]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110105090520/http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/national-universities-rankings/state+IL|archive-date=January 5, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref>

The University of Chicago is continuously ranked as one of the world's top ten universities on various independent university rankings, and its [[Booth School of Business]], along with Northwestern's [[Kellogg School of Management]] consistently rank within the top five graduate business schools in the country and top ten globally. The University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign is often ranked among the best engineering schools in the world and in United States.

Illinois also has more than twenty additional [[Educational accreditation|accredited]] four-year universities, both public and private, and dozens of small [[liberal arts college]]s across the state. Additionally, Illinois supports 49 public [[community college]]s in the [[Illinois Community College System]].

===School financing===

Schools in Illinois are funded primarily by property taxes, based on state assessment of property values, rather than direct state contributions. Scholar Tracy Steffes has described Illinois public education as historically “inequitable,” a system where one of “the wealthiest of states” is “the stingiest in its support for education.” There have been several attempts to reform school funding in Illinois. The most notable attempt came in 1973 with the adoption of the Illinois Resource Equalizer Formula, a measure through which it was hoped funding could be collected and distributed to Illinois schools more equitably. However, opposition from affluent Illinois communities who objected to having to pay for the less well-off school districts (many of them Black majority communities, produced by redlining, white flight, and other “soft” segregation methods) resulted in the formula’s abolition in the late 1980s.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Steffes |first1=Tracy L. |title=Assessment Matters: The Rise and Fall of the Illinois Resource Equalizer Formula |journal=History of Education Quarterly |date=February 2020 |volume=60 |issue=1 |pages=24–57 |doi=10.1017/heq.2020.7}}</ref>

===Transportation===

[[File:Champaign Airport.jpg|thumb|[[University of Illinois Willard Airport]]]]
{{See also|List of airports in Illinois|List of Illinois Routes|List of Illinois railroads|Category:Illinois waterways}}

Because of its central location and its proximity to the [[Rust Belt]] and [[Grain Belt]], Illinois is a national crossroads for air, auto, rail, and truck traffic.

====Airports====

[[File:Concourse B, Chicago O'Hare airport.jpg|thumb|Inside [[O'Hare International Airport]]]]

From 1962 until 1998, Chicago's [[O'Hare International Airport]] (ORD) was the busiest airport in the world, measured both in terms of total flights and passengers. While it was surpassed by [[Atlanta]]'s [[Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport|Hartsfield]] in 1998 (as Chicago splits its air traffic between O'Hare and Midway airports, while Atlanta uses only one airport), with 59.3&nbsp;million domestic passengers annually, along with 11.4&nbsp;million international passengers in 2008,<ref>{{cite web|title=O'Hare International Airport Activity Statistics |url=http://www.flychicago.com/Statistics/stats/1208ORDSUMMARY-REVISED.pdf |publisher=City of Chicago: FlyChicago.com |date=March 27, 2009 |accessdate=April 10, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100101054630/http://flychicago.com/Statistics/stats/1208ORDSUMMARY-REVISED.pdf |archivedate=January 1, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> O'Hare consistently remains one of the two or three busiest airports globally, and in some years still ranks number one in total flights. It is a major [[airline hub|hub]] for both [[United Airlines]] and [[American Airlines]], and a major airport expansion project is currently underway. [[Chicago Midway International Airport|Midway Airport]] (MDW), which had been the busiest airport in the world at one point until it was supplanted by O'Hare as the busiest airport in 1962, is now the secondary airport in the Chicago metropolitan area and still ranks as one of the nation's busiest airports. Midway is a major hub for [[Southwest Airlines]] and services many other carriers as well. Midway served 17.3&nbsp;million domestic and international passengers in 2008.<ref>{{cite web|title=Midway Airport Activity Statistics |url=http://www.flychicago.com/Statistics/stats/1208SUMMARYRevised.pdf |website=FlyChicago.com |publisher=City of Chicago |date=January 30, 2009 |accessdate=April 10, 2009|url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100101054737/http://flychicago.com/Statistics/stats/1208SUMMARYRevised.pdf |archivedate=January 1, 2010 }}</ref>

====Rail====

[[File:Wikipedia Map Final Draft.pdf|thumb|Illinois major rail network]]

Illinois has an extensive passenger and freight rail transportation network. Chicago is a national [[Amtrak]] hub and in-state passengers are served by Amtrak's [[Illinois Service]], featuring the Chicago to Carbondale [[Illini (Amtrak)|''Illini'']] and [[Saluki (Amtrak)|''Saluki'']], the Chicago to Quincy [[Illinois Zephyr and Carl Sandburg|''Carl Sandburg'']] and ''[[Illinois Zephyr and Carl Sandburg|Illinois Zephyr]]'', and the Chicago to St. Louis ''[[Lincoln Service]]''. Currently there is trackwork on the Chicago–St. Louis line to bring the maximum speed up to {{convert|110|mph|abbr=on}}, which would reduce the trip time by an hour and a half. Nearly every North American railway meets at Chicago, making it the largest and most active rail hub in the country. Extensive commuter rail is provided in the city proper and some immediate suburbs by the [[Chicago Transit Authority]]'s [[Chicago "L"|'L']] system. One of the largest suburban commuter rail system in the United States, operated by [[Metra]], uses existing rail lines to provide direct commuter rail access for hundreds of suburbs to the city and beyond.

In addition to the state's rail lines, the [[Mississippi River]] and [[Illinois River]] provide major transportation routes for the state's agricultural interests. [[Lake Michigan]] gives Illinois access to the Atlantic Ocean by way of the [[Saint Lawrence Seaway]].
