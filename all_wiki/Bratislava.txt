== Etymology ==
{{See also|History of Bratislava#Etymology}}
The city received its contemporary name in 1919. Until then, it was mostly known in English by its German name, ''Pressburg'', since after 1526 it was dominated mostly by the Habsburg Monarchy and the city had a relevant ethnic-German population. That is the term from which the pre-1919 Slovak (''Prešporok'') and Czech (''Prešpurk'') names are derived.<ref name="Czechreview"/>

Linguist Ján Stanislav believed the city's Hungarian name, ''Pozsony'', was attributed to the surname Božan, likely a prince who owned the castle before 950. Although the Latin name was also based on the same surname, according to research by lexicologist Milan Majtán, the Hungarian version was never officially represented in official records during the time in which this prince would have lived. The three versions, however, were all related to those found in Slovak, Czech, and German: Vratislaburgum (905), Braslavespurch, and Preslavasburc (both 907).<ref>{{cite web |last1=Nagayo |first1=Susumu |title=A Reflection on the Names of a City in the Borderlands - Pressburg/Pozsony/Prešporok/Bratislava |url=http://src-h.slav.hokudai.ac.jp/coe21/publish/no27_ses/Chapter1.pdf |website=Slavic-Eurasian Research Center |publisher=Hokkaido University |accessdate=June 16, 2020}}</ref>

The medieval settlement ''[[Battle of Pressburg|Brezalauspurc]]'' (literally: [[Braslav of Pannonian Croatia|Braslav]]'s castle) is sometimes attributed to Bratislava, but [[Battle of Pressburg#Location|the actual location of Brezalauspurc is under scholarly debate]]. The city's modern name is credited to [[Pavol Jozef Šafárik]]'s misinterpretation of ''Braslav'' as ''Bratislav'' in his analysis of medieval sources, which led him to invent the term ''Břetislaw'', which later became ''Bratislav''.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780191751394.001.0001/acref-9780191751394-e-995|title=Bratislava – Oxford Reference|author=|date=|work=oxfordreference.com|doi=10.1093/acref/9780191751394.001.0001/acref-9780191751394-e-995}}</ref>

During the revolution of 1918–1919, the name 'Wilsonov' or 'Wilsonstadt' (after President [[Woodrow Wilson]]) was proposed by American Slovaks, as he supported national self-determination. The name ''Bratislava'', which had been used only by some Slovak patriots, became official in March 1919 with the aim that a Slavic name could support the demands that the city should be part of Czechoslovakia.<ref>Pieter C. van Duin.

Other alternative names of the city in the past include Greek: Ιστρόπολις ''Istropolis'' (meaning "[[Hister|Danube]] City", also used in Latin), {{lang-cs|Prešpurk}}, {{lang-fr|Presbourg}}, {{lang-it|Presburgo}}, {{lang-la|Posonium}}, {{lang-ro|Pojon}} and {{lang-sh|Požun / Пожун}}.

In older documents, confusion can be caused by the Latin forms ''Bratislavia, Wratislavia'' etc., which refer to [[Wrocław]], Poland, not Bratislava. The Polish city has a similar etymology, despite spelling differences.<ref>{{Cite book |url=http://www.columbia.edu/acis/ets/Graesse/contents.html |last=Grässe |first=J. G.

The first written reference to a settlement named "Brezalauspurc" dates to 907 and is related to the [[Battle of Pressburg]], during which a [[Bavaria]]n army was defeated by the [[Hungarian people|Hungarians]].

[[File:Bratislava (Posonium) by Matthaus Merian 1638.jpg|thumb|left|Pozsony (Bratislava) in the 17th century]]

In the 10th century, the territory of Pressburg (what would later become [[Pozsony County|Pozsony county]]) became part of Hungary (called the "[[Kingdom of Hungary]]" from 1000). It developed as a key economic and administrative centre on the kingdom's frontier.<ref name="middleages">{{cite web|publisher=City of Bratislava |url=http://www.visit.bratislava.sk/en/vismo/dokumenty2.asp?id_org=700014&id=1008&p1=1572 |title=History – Bratislava in the Middle Ages |year=2005 |accessdate=May 15, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070224024106/http://www.visit.bratislava.sk/en/vismo/dokumenty2.asp?id_org=700014&id=1008&p1=1572 |archivedate=February 24, 2007}}</ref> This strategic position destined the city to be the site of frequent attacks and battles, but also brought it economic development and high political status. It was granted its first known "town privileges" in 1291 by the Hungarian [[Andrew III of Hungary|King Andrew III]],<ref>Špiesz, "Bratislava v stredoveku", p. 43</ref> and was declared a [[free royal town]] in 1405 by [[King of Hungary|King]] [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund]].

Before [[World War I]], the city had a population that was 42% German, 41% Hungarian and 15% Slovak (1910 census, the population was influenced by [[Magyarization]]). The first post war census in 1919 declared the city's ethnic composition at 36% German, 33% Slovak and 29% Hungarian but this may have reflected changing self-identification, rather than an exchange of peoples. Many people were bi- or trilingual and multicultural.

After the [[Communist Party of Czechoslovakia|Communist Party]] seized power in [[History of Czechoslovakia (1945–1948)|Czechoslovakia]] in February 1948, the city became part of the [[Eastern Bloc]].

=== Bratislava Castle ===
{{Main|Bratislava Castle}}
[[File:Bratislava, Hrad, Slovensko.jpg|thumb|[[Bratislava Castle]]]]

One of the most prominent structures in the city is [[Bratislava Castle]], situated on a plateau {{convert|85|m|ft|0}} above the Danube. The castle hill site has been inhabited since the transitional period between the [[Stone Age|Stone]] and [[Bronze Age|Bronze]] ages<ref>Lacika, "Bratislava", pp. 11–12</ref> and has been the [[acropolis]] of a [[Celts|Celtic]] town, part of the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] [[Limes (Roman Empire)|limes]] Romanus, a huge Slavic fortified settlement, and a political, military and religious centre for [[Great Moravia]].<ref>Lacika, "Bratislava", p. 121</ref> A stone [[castle]] was not constructed until the 10th century, when the area was part of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]], howewer, also in [[9th century]] a [[Great Moravian Basilica in Bratislava|pre-romanesque stone basilica]], was standing in the area of the hillfort.

The castle was converted into a [[International Gothic|Gothic]] anti-[[Hussite]] fortress under [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund of Luxemburg]] in 1430, became a [[Renaissance]] castle in 1562,<ref>Lacika, "Bratislava", p. 124</ref> and was rebuilt in 1649 in the [[baroque]] style. Under [[Queen regnant|Queen]] [[Maria Theresa of Austria|Maria Theresa]], the castle became a prestigious royal seat. In 1811, the castle was inadvertently destroyed by fire and lay in ruins until the 1950s,<ref>Lacika, "Bratislava", p. 128</ref> when it was rebuilt mostly in its former Theresian style. In 1940s, it was planned to demolish castle ruins and replace them with new university complex. Howewer, it was never realised, and in 1960s, reconstruction began. Nowadays, it serves for representational purposes and as a historical museum of [[Slovak National Museum]].

The geographical position of Bratislava in Central Europe has long made it a natural crossroads for international trade traffic.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica |url=http://concise.britannica.com/ebc/article-9357955/Bratislava |title=Bratislava |year=2007 |accessdate=April 30, 2007}}</ref>

Public transport in Bratislava is managed by [[Dopravný podnik Bratislava]], a city-owned company. The transport system is known as ''Mestská hromadná doprava'' (MHD, Municipal Mass Transit) and employs buses, [[tram]]s and [[trolleybus]]es.<ref name="publictransportroutes">{{cite web|publisher=[[Dopravný podnik Bratislava]] |url=http://www.dpb.sk/trasy/trasy.htm |title=Trasy liniek (routes) |year=2007 |accessdate=May 17, 2007 |language=Slovak |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070506025027/http://www.dpb.sk/trasy/trasy.htm#Vlaky |archivedate=May 6, 2007}}</ref> Most of the Bratislava public transport is coated in a typical color combination of red and black.

Bratislava is also part of an integrated system ''IDS BK'' connecting city public transport with other transport companies in the Bratislava region. The largest benefit is the possibility of traveling with a single ticket, both in Bratislava and to the nearby villages and cities, including 3 other districts of Senec, Malacky and Pezinok.

As a rail hub, the city has direct connections to [[Austria]], [[Hungary]], the [[Czech Republic]], [[Poland]], [[Germany]], [[Croatia]], [[Slovenia]] and the rest of Slovakia. [[Bratislava-Petržalka railway station]] and [[Bratislava main railway station|Bratislava Main station]] are the principal railway stations.

Main bus station (Autobusová stanica Mlynské Nivy or AS Mlynské Nivy) is located at Mlynské Nivy, east of city centre and offers bus connections to cities in Slovakia and international bus lines. New bus station with a shopping mall, administration centre and Bratislava's tallest skyscraper Nivy Tower all attached is currently in the construction while buses are stopping at a temporary bus station nearby.

The motorway system provides direct access to [[Brno]] in the Czech Republic, [[Vienna]] in Austria, [[Budapest]] in Hungary, [[Trnava]] and other points in Slovakia. The [[Nordostautobahn|A6 motorway]] between Bratislava and [[Vienna]] was opened in November 2007.<ref>{{cite news |title=Vienna-Bratislava in 50 Minutes (''Wien – Bratislava in 50 Minuten'') |language=German |publisher=[[Österreichischer Rundfunk|ORF]] |date=October 19, 2007 |url=http://burgenland.orf.at/stories/229622/ |accessdate=2007-10-19}}</ref>

The [[Port of Bratislava]] is one of the two international [[port|river ports]] in Slovakia. The port provides access to the [[Black Sea]] via the Danube and to the [[North Sea]] through the [[Rhine–Main–Danube Canal]]. Additionally, tourist lines operate from Bratislava's passenger port, including routes to [[Devín]], [[Vienna]] and elsewhere.
In Bratislava there are currently five bridges standing over the [[Danube]] (ordered by the flow of the river): [[Lafranconi Bridge|Most Lafranconi]] (Lafranconi Bridge), [[Most Slovenského národného povstania|Most SNP]] (Bridge of the Slovak National Uprising), [[Starý most (Bratislava)|Starý most]] (The Old Bridge), [[Apollo Bridge|Most Apollo]] (Apollo Bridge) and [[Prístavný most]] (The Harbor Bridge).

Bratislava's [[M.&nbsp;R.&nbsp;Štefánik Airport]] is the main [[international airport]] in Slovakia. The airport is located {{convert|9|km|mi|1}} north-east of the city centre. It serves civil and governmental, scheduled and unscheduled domestic and international flights. The current runways support the landing of all common types of aircraft currently used. It served 2,024,000 passengers in 2007.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=TASR, published in Bratislavské Noviny |url=http://www.bratislavskenoviny.sk/73806/cestovny-ruch/letisko-vybavilo-vlani-viac-ako-2-miliony-pasazierov |title=Airport served more than 2 million passengers last year (''Letisko vybavilo vlani viac ako 2 milióny pasažierov'') |language=Slovak |date=January 13, 2008 |accessdate=January 13, 2008}}</ref> Bratislava is also served by the [[Vienna International Airport]] located {{convert|49|km|mi|1}} west of the city centre.
