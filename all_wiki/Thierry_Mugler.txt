In 1973, Mugler created his first personal collection called "Café de Paris". The style of the collection was both sophisticated and urban.

===Retirement from Fashion===
Clarins shuttered the ready-to-wear component of Mugler's brand in 2003, due to financial losses; however, they kept the perfume division open as it was profitable.<ref>{{cite journal|date=February 2003|title=Thierry Mugler bids au revoir to couture.

But it wasn’t enough, which is why I went on to create in other ways. For me, it wasn’t the right tool anymore. But perfume still interests me".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.elle.com/beauty/a12468934/magic-man-november-2017/|title=Thierry Mugler Glances Back at His Fantastical Past|author=Long, April|date=28 October 2017|magazine=Elle}}</ref>

An April 2010 ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' story discussed Mugler's [[cosmetic surgery|cosmetic transformation]].

Despite retiring from his brand in 2003, he made the exception to design under his name "House of Mugler" for the Met gala in 2019, and for a dear friend of his, Kim Kardashian.

Speaking on the subject Thierry-Maxime Loriot has said, "He told me that after he left the fashion industry, it annoyed him when people recognized him. He felt 'Thierry Mugler' was a label, a brand. He wanted to move on to other things".<ref name=fashionmag/>
