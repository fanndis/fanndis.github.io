{{Politics of Bangladesh}}

The '''prime minister of the [[People's Republic of Bangladesh]]''' ({{lang-bn|গণপ্রজাতন্ত্রী বাংলাদেশের প্রধানমন্ত্রী|translit=Gonoprojatantri Bangladesh Shorkarer Prodhanmontri}}) is the [[chief executive]] of the [[government of Bangladesh]]. The Prime Minister and the [[Cabinet of Bangladesh|Cabinet]] are collectively accountable for their policies and actions to the [[Jatiya Sangsad|Parliament]], to their political party and ultimately to the electorate.

The position was taken over by the military during years of [[History of Bangladesh|1975–78, 1982-86 and 1990-91]] due to imposed [[Military coups in Bangladesh|martial law]]. In each of these periods, the national government leadership was in control of the military with the executive authority of the President and the Prime Minister. During the period between 1996 and 2008, The '''[[Chief Adviser of Bangladesh|Chief Adviser]]''' of the [[Caretaker government of Bangladesh|Caretaker Government]] of the [[People's Republic of Bangladesh]] exercised authority as per the constitution as the [[Head of government]] for 90 days during transition between one [[Elections in Bangladesh|elected]] government to another. The Chief Adviser headed an Advisory Committee comprising ten Advisers. With powers roughly equivalent to those of the '''Prime Minister''' of an elected governments, his executive power was constrained with certain constitutional limitations. The system was scrapped in 2011 by 15th amendment of constitution to allow political government to conduct any General Election in future.

The current prime minister, [[Sheikh Hasina|Sheikh Hasina Wazed]], was appointed on 6 January 2009 by the [[President of Bangladesh]] and she is also the longest serving prime minister in the country's history.

== History and timeline==
=== Origin ===
Bangladesh origins lie in [[Bengal Presidency|Bengal]], a province of the [[British India]] that included present-day [[West Bengal]]. Between 1937 and 1947 it was intermittently governed by a popularly elected [[ministry (collective executive)|ministry]], whose head is often designated the '''[[Premier of Bengal]]'''. In 1947, Bengal province was [[Partition of India|partitioned]] into the Indian state of West Bengal and [[East Pakistan]]. All three erstwhile Bengal premiers—[[A. K. Fazlul Huq]], [[Khawaja Nazimuddin]] and [[H. S. Suhrawardy]]—became Pakistani citizens; the latter two went on to become [[Prime Ministers of Pakistan]] in the 1950s.

East Pakistan's history from 1947 to 1971 was marked by political instability and economic difficulties. The nascent democratic institutions foundered in the face of military intervention in 1958, and the government imposed martial law between 1958 and 1962, and again between 1969 and 1971. Between 1947 and 1971 it was intermittently governed by Governors and Chief Minister of East Pakistan.

The modern office of Prime Minister was established following the [[Bangladeshi Declaration of Independence|declaration of independence]] of [[East Pakistan]] with the [[Provisional Government of Bangladesh]] on 17 April 1971, of which [[Tajuddin Ahmad]] became the first Prime Minister of Bangladesh. Since the adoption of the current [[Constitution of Bangladesh]] in 1972 the formal title of the office is The Prime Minister of the People's Republic of Bangladesh.

=== Military coups and presidential regimes ===
=== Return of parliamentary government ===
In September 1991, the electorate approved changes to the constitution, formally creating a parliamentary system and returning governing power to the office of the prime minister, as in Bangladesh's original constitution. In October 1991, members of parliament elected a new head of state, President Abdur Rahman Biswas.<ref name=History>{{cite web |date=15 December 1992 |title=Background Note: Bangladesh |url=http://dosfan.lib.uic.edu/ERC/bgnotes/sa/bangladesh9201.html |publisher=US Department of State |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170402124354/http://dosfan.lib.uic.edu/ERC/bgnotes/sa/bangladesh9201.html |archive-date=2 April 2017 |access-date=5 April 2008 |via=University of Illinois at Chicago}}</ref>

===Hasina-Khaleda rivalry===
For almost three decades, Bangladeshi politics have been dominated by [[Khaleda Zia]] and [[Hasina Wazed]]. They have been the only people to serve as non-interim Prime Minister since 1991.

'''Khaleda Zia (BNP)'''

Khaleda Zia served as Prime Minister of Bangladesh three times, since 1991.
Once in power, Khaleda Zia's government made substantial changes in education policy, introducing free education for girls up to the 10th grade, a stipend for female students, and food for education programme funds. It also made highest budgetary allocation in the education sector.

She became Prime Minister for the second consecutive term after the BNP had a landslide victory on 15 February 1996 general election to the sixth Jatiya Sangsad which is widely believed to be rigged voting after bribeing the election commissioner. The election was, however, boycotted by all other major parties who were demanding that the elections be held under a neutral caretaker government, following allegations of rigging in a by-election held in 1994. Turnout was estimated at around 5%, though the government at the time claimed it to be much higher. On 12 June 1996 polls, BNP lost to [[Hasina wazed]]'s [[Awami League]] but emerged as the largest opposition party in the country's parliamentary history with 116 seats.

Aiming to return to power, the BNP formed a four-party alliance on 6 January 1999 with its former political opinion [[Jatiya Party (Ershad)|Jatiya Party]], and the Islamic party of [[Jamaat-e-Islami Bangladesh]] and the [[Islami Oikya Jot]] and launched several agitation programmes against the ruling [[Awami League]]. In the 2001 general elections [[Bangladesh Nationalist Party|BNP]] won the election with a two-thirds majority of seats in parliament and 46% of the vote (compared to the principal opposition party's 40%) and Khaleda Zia was once again sworn in as the Prime Minister of Bangladesh.

In 2008 election, they faced a landslide defeat. Khaleda led four-party alliance won only 32 seats and emerged as the smallest opposition party in the country's parliamentary history. They won only 32% of the total vote where their main rival Awami League won more than 50% of the total vote.

In the Tenth Jatiyo Sangsad election of 2014, the BNP along with its 18 party alliance boycotted and violently protested the election to no avail.

'''Hasina wazed (Awami League)'''

Hasina wazed lost to Khaleda Zia in 1991 parliamentary election after managing to win 88 seats and her party sat in opposition benches. She boycotted the 1996 February 15 elections giving Khaleda Zia a default victory.

Awami League won 146 seats in the 1996 June 12 parliamentary elections. The support of the [[Jatiya Party (Ershad)|Jatiya Party]] and a few independent candidates were enough for the 150 or more seats needed for the required majority. Hasina wazed took the oath as the prime minister of [[Bangladesh]]. She vowed to create a ''Government of National Unity''. Though some smaller parties and a few individuals from BNP did join the government, the distance between the main two political parties as well as their leaders remained as large as ever.

[[Awami League]] was defeated in the 2001 Parliament election. It won only 62 seats in the Parliament, while the Four-Party Alliance led by the [[Bangladesh Nationalist Party]] won more than 200 seats, giving them a two-thirds majority in the Parliament. Hasina wazed herself was defeated from a constituency in Rangpur, which happened to contain her husband's hometown, but won from three other seats. Hasina wazed and the Awami League rejected the results, claiming that the election was rigged with the help of the President and the Caretaker government. However, the [[international community]] was largely satisfied with the elections and the Four-Party Alliance went on to form the government.

In the December 2008 election, Hasina wazed Awami league got a landslide victory winning 230 seats, which gave them the two-thirds majority in the parliament. She made an alliance with JP and left fronts and her grand alliance won 252 seats in the parliament. Hasina wazed took oath as Prime Minister on 6 January 2009. She is still the prime minister of Bangladesh after winning a walkover 5 January 2014 election when Khaleda Zia's BNP boycotted the general election.

Hasina secured a fourth term as prime minister after winning the 2019 general election.

=== 2007 political crisis and caretaker government===
{{main|2006–08 Bangladeshi political crisis|Caretaker government of Bangladesh}}
The scheduled [[2007 Bangladeshi parliamentary elections|22 January 2007 elections]] were marred by controversy. The Awami League and its allies protested, saying that the elections would not be fair because of alleged bias by the caretaker government in favour of Khaleda Zia and the BNP. Hasina demanded that the head of the caretaker government, President [[Iajuddin Ahmed]], step down from that position, and on 3 January 2007, she announced that the Awami League and its allies would boycott the elections.<ref>{{cite news |last=Habib |first=Haroon |authorlink=Haroon Habib |date=4 January 2007 |title =Polls won't be fair: Hasina |url=http://www.hindu.com/2007/01/04/stories/2007010405671400.htm |newspaper=The Hindu}}</ref> Later in the month, the military led by Army Chief General Moinuddin Ahmed intervened and President [[Iajuddin Ahmed]] was asked to resign as the Chief Advisor. He was also made to declare a state of emergency. A new military-controlled Caretaker government was formed with Dr. Fakhruddin Ahmed as the Chief Adviser. The scheduled parliamentary election was postponed.

On 12 January 2007, [[Iajuddin Ahmed|President Iajuddin Ahmed]] swore in [[Fakhruddin Ahmed]] as the Chief Adviser to the Interim Caretaker Government. For a country widely perceived as one of the world's most corrupt, the most dramatic aspect of Fakhruddin Ahmed's rule is his antigraft campaign against the establishment. So far, more than 160 senior politicians, top civil servants and security officials have been arrested on suspicion of graft and other economic crimes.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Abdullah |first=Abir |date=22 March 2007 |title=Corruption has emerged as a great threat |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1601618,00.html |magazine=Time}}</ref>{{Update inline|date=July 2020}} The roundup has netted former ministers from the two main political parties, including former prime ministers [[Khaleda Zia]] and [[Sheikh Hasina]] and former adviser [[Fazlul Haque (judge)|Fazlul Haque]].

On May 11, 2017, the Office of Bangladesh Prime Minister Hasina Wazed announced that then [[United States Secretary of State|US Secretary of State]] [[Hillary Clinton]] called her office in March 2011 to demand that Dr. [[Muhammad Yunus|Muhammed Yunus]], a 2006 [[Nobel Peace Prize|Nobel Peace prize]] winner, be restored to his role as chairman of microcredit bank, [[Grameen Bank]]. The bank's nonprofit Grameen America, which Yunus chairs, has given between $100,000 and $250,000 to the [[Clinton Global Initiative]]. Grameen Research, which is chaired by Yunus, has donated between $25,000 and $50,000, according to the Clinton Foundation website.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://nation.foxnews.com/2017/05/16/circa-prime-minister-bangladesh-says-clinton-personally-pressured-her-help-donor|title=Circa: Prime Minister of Bangladesh Says Clinton Personally Pressured Her to Help Donor|last=Nation|first=Fox|date=2017-07-31|website=FoxNation.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-07-31}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://townhall.com/tipsheet/mattvespa/2017/05/16/oh-my-prime-minister-of-bangladesh-says-clinton-put-pressure-on-her-to-help--donor-n2325645|title=Oh My: Prime Minister Of Bangladesh Says Clinton Put Pressure On Her To Help Donor|last=Vespa|first=Matt|work=Townhall|access-date=2017-07-31|language=en}}</ref>
