'''Zhuhai''' ({{IPAc-en|'|dʒ|uː|'|h|aɪ}},<ref>{{cite web|title=Zhuhai pronunciation|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/Zhuhai|website=thefreedictionary.com|access-date=27 April 2015}}</ref> {{zh|t=珠海|p=Zhūhǎi}}; [[Yale romanization of Cantonese|Yale]]: ''Jyūhói'') is a [[prefecture-level city]] located on the west bank of [[Pearl River (China)|Pearl River]] [[estuary]] on the central coast of southern [[Guangdong province]], [[People's Republic of China]], on the southeastern edge of [[Pearl River Delta]].  Its name literally means "pearl sea", which originates from the city's location at the [[river mouth|mouth]] of the Pearl River meeting the [[South China Sea]].  Zhuhai borders [[Jiangmen]] to the west, [[Zhongshan]] to the north and [[Macau]] to the southeast, and shares [[maritime boundaries]] with [[Shenzhen]] and [[Hong Kong]] to the northeast across the estuary.

Zhuhai was one of the original four [[Special Economic Zones of China|Special Economic Zones]] established in 1980, as well as one of China's premier tourist destinations, being called the [[Chinese Riviera]]. While the city is located in the traditionally [[Cantonese]]-speaking region of Guangdong, a significant portion of the population is now made up of [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]]-speaking economic migrants originally from inland provinces.

The core of Zhuhai, in the northeastern portion of the administrative division, is part of the [[Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Greater Bay Area]], the biggest built-up area in the world with more than 44,478,513 inhabitants at the 2010 census, encompassing Shenzhen, Dongguan, Foshan, Zhongshan, Macau, Hong Kong, the main part of Guangzhou, and small parts of Jiangmen and Huizhou cities.

According to a report released in 2014 by the [[Chinese Academy of Social Sciences]], Zhuhai is the most livable city in China.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.163.com/14/0509/15/9RQHTIPB00014JB5.html |script-title=zh:社科院：珠海取代香港成为最宜居城市] 网易新闻 |website=[[163.com]] news |date=2014-05-09}}</ref>

== Geography ==

Zhuhai borders the [[Macau]] [[Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China|Special Administrative Region]] (north and west), and is {{convert|140|km|0|abbr=off}} southwest of [[Guangzhou]]. Its territory has {{convert|690|km|0|abbr=off}} of coastline and 217 islands, of which 147 are over 500 square metres in area.<ref name=isl>[http://www.cityofzhuhai.com/2019-02/20/c_270301.htm "Overview of Zhuhai" cityofzhuhai.com Updated: 2019-02-20]</ref>

The islands within the prefecture-level city of Zhuhai include a number of near-shore islands, often connected to the mainland by bridges or causeways (such as [[Hengqin]], [[Qi'ao]], or [[Yelidao|Yeli]] Islands), as well as some islands in the open [[South China Sea]] (the [[Wanshan Archipelago]]). Some of the latter are actually geographically closer to [[Hong Kong]] than to the Zhuhai mainland. The jurisdiction of [[Nei Lingding Island]], located in the [[Pearl River (China)|Pearl River]] [[estuary]] was transferred from Zhuhai to Shenzhen in 2009.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.sznews.com/content/2009-09/26/content_4081368_2.htm |script-title=zh:内伶仃岛归属深圳市管辖 |work=Shenzhen News |language=zh-hans |date=2009-09-26}}</ref>

== Economy ==

Zhuhai became a city in 1979, a year before it was designated as one of the first [[Special economic zones of China|Special Economic Zone]]s of China (SEZ). Similarly to neighboring [[Shenzhen]], which became the first Special Economic Zone of China in 1978, the implementation of Zhuhai as an SEZ was largely due to its strategic position facing Macau, a capitalist trading center similar to Shenzhen's position with Hong Kong.

The establishment of Zhuhai as an SEZ allowed the Chinese Central Government and economy to have easier access to the Macau and consequently, global market. As a result, Zhuhai is now a major city in the Pearl River Delta region according to the new general urban plan approved by the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council]]. The implementation of Special Economy Zone intended for the city to become a key port city, science and education city, scenic and tourism city, and as a regional hub for transportation.

The outstanding geographic location, a wide range of supporting infrastructure and a deep-water port serve as a major attraction for foreign capital. Utilized foreign investment reached US$10.344 billion in 2008. Among the top 500 enterprises worldwide, 19 of them have investment projects in Zhuhai such as [[ExxonMobil]], [[BP]], [[Siemens AG|Siemens]], [[Carrefour]] and [[Panasonic Corporation|Matsushita]]. Hong Kong is the largest overseas investor in Zhuhai, accounting for 22% of total utilized foreign investment in 2002.

=== Manufacturing industries ===
Industrial development in Zhuhai focuses on five new high-tech and heavy industries including [[electronics]], computer software, [[biotechnology]] and [[pharmacy]], machinery and equipment as well as [[petrochemical]] industries. Aiming to strengthen the existing industrial base as well as to provide a better environment for the development of new high-tech industries, the local government has taken the initiative in developing five economic zones:

* Zhuhai High-Tech Industrial Development Zone
As one of the four earliest Special Economic Zones (SEZs) in China, Zhuhai SEZ was set up in the year 1980 and granted with a local legislative right. Zhuhai hi-tech zone is located in the north of Zhuhai, which is very close to downtown. Furthermore, technological resources are centralized in our zone; there is also a huge development in hi-tech industries led by the software and IC industries. The hi-tech zone is the showcase for Zhuhai's scientific development.<ref>[http://rightsite.asia/en/industrial-zone/zhuhai-national-hi-tech-development-zone/ Zhuhai High-Tech Industrial Zone]. RightSite.asia.</ref> [[Meizu]] is one high tech product headquartered in Zhuhai.
* Zhuhai Free Trade Zone<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cfea.org.cn/bs/zh.asp |script-title=zh:中国保税区出口加工区协会 |website=Cfea.org.cn}}</ref>
Zhuhai Free Trade Zone (Zhuhai FTZ) was founded in 1996 with the State Council's approval, occupying {{convert|3|km2|abbr=on}}. A Zhuhai FTZ Administrative Committee was set up in June 1997. By the end of 2006, there had been over 200 companies registered in the Free Trade Zone, including more than 150 foreign-funded enterprises, and the total investment amount was one billion US dollars. Industries encouraged in the zone include electronics assembly & manufacturing, telecommunications equipment, building/construction materials, instruments & industrial equipment production, medical equipment and supplies, raw material processing, research & development, shipping/warehousing/logistics, and heavy industry.<ref>[http://rightsite.asia/en/industrial-zone/zhuhai-free-trade-zone/ Zhuhai Free Trade Zone]. RightSite.asia.</ref>

* Harbour industrial zone (provincial level)
* Wanshan ocean development testing zone (provincial level)

The Wanshan archipelago is located in one of the major fishing areas of China and is core to the Wanshan ocean development testing zone. However, ''[[Perna viridis]]'', a species of green mussel, was found to be contaminated by HCHs, DDTs, and PCBs.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rddl.com.cn/CN/abstract/abstract813.shtml |script-title=zh:珠海万山群岛海上生态公园建设规划构想 |last1=Huang |first1=Shaohui (黄少辉) |last2=Wang |first2=Weichen (王伟臣) |website=rddl.com.cn}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |script-title=zh:珠江河口区翡翠贻贝中有机氯农药和多氯联苯含量及分布 |last1=Fang |first1=Zhanqiang (方展强) |last2=Zhang |first2=Runxing (张润兴) |last3=Huang |first3=Minghong (黄铭洪) |journal=Huan Jing Ke Xue Xue Bao Shuang Yue Kan |doi=10.13671/j.hjkxxb.2001.01.022 |script-journal=zh:环境科学学报 |trans-journal=Acta Scientiae Circumstantiae |issn=0253-2468 |year=2001 |issue=1}}</ref>

* Global printer consumables manufacturing centre

Zhuhai manufactured and supplied 70% of the world's ribbons, 60% of the world's aftermarket inkjet cartridges and 20% of the world's third-party laser toner cartridges. Their combined sales were worth more than 1.3 billion US dollars or 10% of all the sales in the world. Zhuhai owns a comprehensive supply chain and almost any of the raw materials needed by the printer consumables industry can be provided locally.

== Administration ==

The [[prefecture-level city]] of Zhuhai administers three [[Administrative divisions of the People's Republic of China#County level|county-level divisions]] and four special economic districts, all of which are [[District of China|districts]].

They used to fly to Guangzhou Baiyun Airport from this airport using [[Cessna 208 Caravan|Cessna C208 Caravan]] as well, but the route was discontinued.
Zhuhai also is served by airports outside:
* [[Macau International Airport]] {{airport codes|MFM|VMMC}}, which is closer to the city of Zhuhai proper, than Zhuhai Jinwan Airport itself, has an "Express Link" service in which transiting passengers who go through [[Gongbei Port of Entry]]/[[Posto Fronteiriço das Portas do Cerco]] are not processed through Macau customs; passengers may also have their baggage taken from Macau Airport to [[Lótus Bridge]] in [[Hengqin Island]].<ref>"[http://www.macau-airport.com/en/transportation/express-link-service Express Link Service]."[[Macau International Airport]].

=== Railway ===

[[Zhuhai Railway Station]] is located at the western end of [[Gongbei Port of Entry]] and [[Portas do Cerco]] at the border of Zhuhai and [[Macau]]. There are frequent [[China Railway High-speed|high speed]] trains to Guangzhou, Guilin, Beijing, Shanghai, Chengdu and other main cities in China. The intercity railway between Zhuhai Gongbei and Zhuhai Jinwan International Airport is under construction. It is expected to be opened to Hengqin in November 2019, and the whole project will be completed in 2024. It will take only 30 minutes to commute from urban district to the airport using the completed line.

Zhuhai also has a [[Trams in Zhuhai|tram network]], with the first phase of Line 1 completed in 2014. In 2017, Line 1 began service to the public.

The Zhuhai Metro ({{zh|labels=no|s=珠海地铁}}) is currently in the planning stage. Line 1 will start from Jiuzhou Port and end at the Jinwan Station, with a total length of 36.8&nbsp;km; Line 2 will start from Jinding Industrial Area and end at Gongbei Port, with a total length of 30.5&nbsp;km. Construction was expected to start in 2019, with an estimated time of completion in 2024.

=== Sea ===

Zhuhai is known for its good climate and good air quality. Endowed with a long coastline, it is the only city on the western Pearl River Delta with natural deep-water ports.

Zhuhai has two international [[seaport]]s: [[Jiuzhou Port|Jiuzhou]] ({{zh|labels=no|c=九洲港}}) and Gaolan ({{zh|labels=no|s=高栏港}}). Gaolan Port is one of the leading ports in Guangdong province, while [[Jiuzhou Port]] focuses on heavy passenger sea transport.

[[Chu Kong Passenger Transport Co., Ltd|Chu Kong Passenger Transport]] operates a ferry service between Zhuhai's [[Jiuzhou Port]], Hong Kong and [[Shekou Passenger Terminal]], in the [[Nanshan District, Shenzhen|Nanshan District]] of [[Shenzhen]]. A service between [[Jiuzhou Port]] and [[Hong Kong International Airport]] for air passengers using the airport began on 10 July 2007.<ref>[http://www.news.gov.hk/en/category/infrastructureandlogistics/070710/html/070710en06002.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070812192440/http://www.news.gov.hk/en/category/infrastructureandlogistics/070710/html/070710en06002.htm |date=12 August 2007 }}</ref>

=== Road ===

Zhuhai is currently served by two major [[Expressways of China|Chinese national expressways]]:

[[File:China_Expwy_G94_sign_with_name.svg|25px]] [[G94 Pearl River Delta Ring Expressway]]
* The G94 Pearl River Delta Ring Expressway, which will form a beltway surrounding the [[Guangzhou]] [[Pearl River Delta|metropolitan area]] when completed, currently connects Zhuhai to the [[Sanshui District]] of [[Foshan]]. In 2018 the [[Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge]] opened, reducing the travel time by road from Zhuhai to Hong Kong in approximately 40 minutes. G94 was extended to follow this bridge, with sections currently under construction connecting the bridge to the Zhuhai-Foshan section.

[[File:China_Expwy_G0425_sign_with_name.svg|25px]] [[G0425 Guangzhou–Macau Expressway]]
* A spur route of the mainline [[G4 Beijing–Hong Kong–Macau Expressway]], G0425 directly links Guangzhou to Zhuhai (and thus, Macau). It has a concurrency with G94 for several kilometers. Heavy traffic between Zhuhai and [[Macau]] has led to the construction of a new cross-border corridor, the [[Lotus Bridge]], built in November 1999 to divert traffic away from the congested [[Gongbei Port of Entry]] ([[Portas do Cerco]]). G0425 currently ends in Zhuhai at Zhuhai Avenue, pending an extension to the Lotus Bridge via [[Hengqin]] island.

== Tourism ==

[[File:Zhuhai-fishing-port-0693.jpg|thumb|left|Xiangzhou fishing harbor, with the forested Yeli Island in the horizon]]
Zhuhai and the surrounding landscapes have a reputation within China of being a garden city with a high quality of life.  In 2002, the city attracted 1.3 million international tourists and 3.64 million domestic tourists. Following Guangzhou and [[Shenzhen]], Zhuhai has the third largest amount of foreign tourism in the Guangdong province.{{when|date=August 2020}}{{citation needed|date=August 2020}}

Zhuhai hosts the [[China International Aviation & Aerospace Exhibition]] biannually in November. It is the largest Air Show in China and a huge tourist attraction.

Realizing the benefits brought by tourism, the local government is expanding tourist destinations and is developing new spots such as [[Hengqin]] ({{zh|labels=no|s=横琴岛}}), Dong'ao ({{zh|labels=no|s=东澳}}), [[Hebao Island|Hebao]] ({{zh|labels=no|c=荷包}}), Qi'ao ({{zh|labels=no|s=淇澳岛}}) and Yeli ({{zh|labels=no|c=野狸}}).

=== New Yuan Ming Palace ===

The New Yuan Ming Palace ({{zh|first=s|s=圆明新园|t=圓明新園}}) is a park of {{convert|1.39|km²|2|abbr=off}}, including an {{convert|80000|m²|0|abbr=on}} lake. It features a partial reconstruction of the [[Old Summer Palace]] in Beijing, destroyed in 1860 by French and British troops during the [[second Opium War]], which was never rebuilt on its original site.<ref>[http://www.travelchinaguide.com/attraction/guangdong/zhuhai/new-yuanming-palace.htm New Yuanming Palace at].

=== Coast of Xianglu Bay—Fisher Girl Statue ===

The coast of Xianglu Bay is considered the 'symbol' of Zhuhai, offering a scenic view of Zhuhai (Pearl River) Delta with silt-rich water, rocks, and a beach. The famous landmark of the city, the Fisher Girl Statue, stands elegantly on a boulder in Xianglu Bay; the statue is draped by a fishnet and holds a pearl high in the air with both hands up to the sky, symbolizing a vigorous and lively Zhuhai welcoming visitors from all over the world. It was erected in 1982 by a professor from the [[Guangzhou Academy of Fine Arts]] and is 8.7 meters tall, composed of 70 pieces of granite. Visitors can view the statue up close from a boardwalk on the shore.<ref>[http://members.virtualtourist.com/m/p/m/1e8bdb/ "Walking along the Coast of Xianglu Bay" Zhuhai Things to Do Tip by MINOSUKE]. Members.virtualtourist.com.</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.topchinatravel.com/china-attractions/the-statue-of-the-fisher-girl.htm |title=Statue of Fisher Girl in Zhuhai: The Landmark of Zhuhai City |website=www.topchinatravel.com |access-date=2019-06-16}}</ref>

[[File:Zhuhai-Fishing-Girl-statue-0777.jpg|thumb|right|Fisher Girl statue in Xianglu Bay]]

The statue was based on a local legend, in which the daughter of the celestial Dragon King visited the [[Pearl River delta]]. Enamored by the beauty of the Zhuhai region, she disguised herself as a fisher girl and lived among the people there, weaving baskets and healing locals with her powers until she fell in love with a fellow fisherman named Haipeng. The romance between Haipeng and the fisher girl was interrupted by vicious rumors among the people about the latter's true origins. Haipeng eventually confronted the fisher girl about this and demanded she give her magical pearl bracelets to him as proof of her love. She confirmed the rumors and explained that if she removed even one of the pearls, she would die. As Haipeng refused to believe her story and turned to leave, the fisher girl took off her bracelets, dying in Haipeng's arms. Heartbroken and guilt-ridden, Haipeng set out to find a cure, eventually discovering from a local elder that he would need to cultivate a special grass with his own blood. After years of toiling, Haipeng finally harvested enough to revive the fisher girl, turning her into a mortal. The two later married and the fisher girl found a large pearl, which she gifted to the elder in gratitude on the day of the wedding.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://internchina.com/the-love-story-behind-the-zhuhai-fisher-girl/ |title=The Love Story Behind the Zhuhai Fisher Girl |date=2013-11-29 |website=InternChina |language=en-UK |access-date=2019-06-16}}</ref>

== Education ==

=== Strategic development ===

Developing a university park is part of Zhuhai's strategy to strengthen its high-tech and IT industries. Compared with Beijing and Shanghai, Zhuhai and other cities in Guangdong province face a serious shortage of talent and professionals. The local government is taking significant initiatives to set up a university park with an area of {{convert|20|km²|0|abbr=off}} (the only such plan in the western Pearl River Delta).

=== Colleges and universities ===

* Zhuhai Campus of [[Jinan University]]
* [[Beijing Normal University]], Zhuhai Campus
* [[Beijing Institute of Technology]], Zhuhai Campus
* [[Sun Yat-Sen University]], Zhuhai Campus
* Zhuhai College of [[Jilin University]]
*[[University of Macau]] (under the jurisdiction of [[Macau SAR]] government)
* [[United International College]]
* Zhuhai Radio & TV University

A number of other colleges and universities are also located in or near Zhuhai. Beijing Normal University Zhuhai Campus was created as a new model university. Besides its high quality of education, it is more internationally oriented than many universities in China. Many students here prepare to go abroad to finish their junior and senior years.

=== Primary and secondary education ===

Despite the shortage of higher education, Zhuhai government has been paying a lot of attention to primary and secondary education. From 2007, high school students in Zhuhai needn't pay school fees anymore.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.163.com/17/0509/14/CK0IQ6GN000187VE.html |script-title=zh:珠海"高中免费教育"十年:补贴6.5亿 55万人次受惠 |publisher=[[163.com]] news |date=2017-05-09}}</ref>

As a result, there are many famous high schools in Zhuhai. [[Zhuhai No.1 High School]] (ZH1Z) is one of the most competitive high schools in Guangdong Province, and also a member of the Guangdong "Six Schools Union".

[[Dulwich International High School Zhuhai]], [[QSI International School of Zhuhai]], and [[Zhuhai International School]] serve expatriates and/or use foreign educational systems.

== Sports facilities ==

Zhuhai is the first city in China to have constructed a motor racing circuit. The [[Zhuhai International Circuit]] was built in 1996 and is located at Jinding, near the border to Zhongshan. ZIC has held the BPR Global GT Endurance Series in 1996, the [[FIA GT Championship]] in 1997, 1999, 2004 and 2005. It hosted the championship's 2007 opening round on 24 and 25 March. ZIC had planned to host a round of the [[Champ Car World Series]] on 20 May 2007, but agreement was not reached. ZIC held an [[A1GP]] race in 2007 for the first time in series' history. ZIC became the first venue in China to host the [[Intercontinental Le Mans Cup]] on 7 November 2010 when the [[2010 1000 km of Zhuhai]] was staged.

Zhuhai has also a new tennis center which hosts [[WTA Elite Trophy]], the last tournament of the year for players that are in the top 20 but did not qualify to [[WTA Finals]].
