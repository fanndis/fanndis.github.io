The '''2016 Democratic Party presidential primaries and caucuses''' were a series of electoral contests organized by the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] to select the 4,051 delegates to the [[2016 Democratic National Convention]] held July 25–28 and determine the nominee for [[President of the United States]] in the [[2016 United States presidential election|58th U.S. presidential election]]. The elections took place within all fifty [[U.S. state]]s, the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]], five [[Territories of the United States|U.S. territories]], and [[Democrats Abroad]] and occurred between February 1 and June 14, 2016.

A total of six major candidates entered the race starting April 12, 2015, when former [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] and [[New York (state)|New York]] [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Hillary Clinton]] formally announced her second bid for the presidency. She was followed by [[Vermont]] [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Bernie Sanders]], former [[Governor of Maryland]] [[Martin O'Malley]], former [[Governor of Rhode Island]] [[Lincoln Chafee]], former [[Virginia]] Senator [[Jim Webb]] and [[Harvard Law School|Harvard Law]] Professor [[Lawrence Lessig]]. A draft movement was started to encourage [[Massachusetts]] Senator [[Elizabeth Warren]] to seek the presidency, but Warren declined to run, as did incumbent Vice President [[Joe Biden]]. Webb, Chafee, and Lessig withdrew prior to the February 1, 2016, [[Iowa Democratic caucuses, 2016|Iowa caucuses]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://newrepublic.com/article/123116/americans-love-underdog-just-not-chafee-webb-or-omalley|title=Americans Love an Underdog—Just Not Lincoln Chafee, Jim Webb, or Martin O’Malley|last=Reston|first=Laura|date=2015-10-14|website=New Republic|access-date=2016-06-02}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2015/11/lawrence-lessig-drops-out-215443 |title=Lessig drops out of presidential race|work=Politico|date=November 2, 2015|access-date=November 2, 2015|author=Strauss, Daniel}}</ref>

[[File:Hillary Clinton April 2015.jpg|thumb|220px|Former Secretary of State [[Hillary Clinton]] in April 2015]]

In the weeks following the re-election of President Obama in the [[2012 United States presidential election|2012 election]], media speculation regarding potential candidates for the Democratic presidential nomination in the 2016 presidential election began to circulate. The speculation centered on the prospects of Clinton, then-[[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]], making a second presidential bid in the 2016 election. Clinton had previously served as a [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] for New York (2001–09) and was the [[First Lady of the United States|First Lady of the U.S.]] (1993–2001).<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2012/12/05/run-hillary-run-majority-want-a-clinton-2016-candidacy/| title=Run Hillary Run!: Majority want a Clinton 2016 candidacy | work=[[The Washington Post]] | date=December 5, 2012 | access-date=March 7, 2015 | author=Cohen, Jon}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2012/12/10/clinton-rides-high-poll-numbers-into-private-life-for-now/| title=Clinton rides high poll numbers into private life (for now?) | publisher=CNN | date=December 10, 2012 | access-date=March 7, 2015 | author=Steinhauser, Paul}}</ref> A January 2013 ''[[The Washington Post|Washington Post]]''–[[ABC News]] poll indicated that she had high popularity among the American public.<ref name="new heights">{{cite web | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2013/01/23/record-high-for-hillary-clinton-as-she-faces-little-regarded-congress/| title=Hillary Clinton reaches new heights of political popularity | work=[[The Washington Post]] | date=January 23, 2013 | access-date=March 7, 2015 | author1=Cohen, Jon | author2=Blake, Aaron}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/DC-Decoder/Decoder-Buzz/2012/1210/Are-Republicans-really-incapable-of-beating-Hillary-Clinton-in-2016| title=Are Republicans really 'incapable' of beating Hillary Clinton in 2016?

===February 2016: early primaries===
Despite being heavily favored in polls issued weeks earlier, Clinton was only able to defeat Sanders in the first-in-the-nation [[Iowa caucuses|Iowa Caucus]] by the closest margin in the history of the contest: 49.8% to 49.6% (Clinton collected 700.47 state delegate equivalents to Sanders' 696.92, a difference of one-quarter of a percentage point).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/ia/iowa_democratic_presidential_caucus-3195.html |title=Election 2016 - Iowa Democratic Presidential Caucus|publisher=RealClearPolitics|access-date=March 28, 2016}}</ref> This led to speculation that she won due to six coin-toss tiebreakers all resulting in her favor. However, the only challenge to the caucus' results was in a single precinct, which gave Clinton a fifth delegate.<ref name="NPRIowa">{{cite web |last1=Montanaro |first1=Domenico |title=Coin-Toss Fact-Check: No, Coin Flips Did Not Win Iowa For Hillary Clinton |url=https://www.npr.org/2016/02/02/465268206/coin-toss-fact-check-no-coin-flips-did-not-win-iowa-for-hillary-clinton |website=npr.org |publisher=National Public Radio, Inc. |access-date=18 August 2019}}</ref>

The 2016 primary schedule was significantly different from that of 2008. During [[Democratic Party presidential primaries, 2008#Super Tuesday|that election cycle]], many states moved their primaries or caucuses to earlier in the calendar to have greater influence over the race. In 2008, February 5 was the earliest date allowed by the Democratic National Committee, leading 23 states and territories to move their elections to that date, the biggest Super Tuesday to ever take place. For 2016, the calendar was more disparate than it was in 2008, with several groups of states voting on different dates, the most important being March 1, March 15, April 26 and June 7. The day with the most contests was March 1, 2016, in which primaries or caucuses were held in 11 states (including six in the [[Southern United States]]) and [[American Samoa]]. A total of 865 pledged delegates were at stake.

Clinton secured victories in all of the southern contests except [[Oklahoma Democratic primary, 2016|Oklahoma]]. Her biggest victory of the day came in [[Alabama Democratic primary, 2016|Alabama]], where she won 77.8% of the vote against Sanders' 19.2%, although her most significant delegate prize came from Texas, where she received 65.2% of the vote with strong support from non-white as well as white voters. Collectively, the southern states gave Clinton a net gain of 165 pledged delegates.<ref name="nyt-st1-res">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/elections/2016/results/2016-03-01 |title=Super Tuesday Results 2016|work=The New York Times|date=March 14, 2016|access-date=April 6, 2016}}</ref> Apart from the South, Clinton also narrowly defeated Sanders in [[Massachusetts Democratic primary, 2016|Massachusetts]], as well as winning in the territory of [[American Samoa]]. Sanders scored comfortable wins in the [[Minnesota Democratic caucuses, 2016|Minnesota]] and [[Colorado Democratic caucuses, 2016|Colorado]] caucuses and [[Oklahoma Democratic primary, 2016|Oklahoma]] primary and won an 86.1%–13.6% landslide in his home state of [[Vermont Democratic primary, 2016|Vermont]] - one of only two times either of the two main candidates missed the 15% threshold in a state or territory, with the [[U.S. Virgin Islands]], where Clinton received over 87% of the vote, being the other one. Although the results overall were unfavorable for Sanders, his four wins and narrow loss allowed him to remain in the race in anticipation of more favorable territory in [[New England]], the [[Great Plains]], [[Mountain States]] and the [[Pacific Northwest]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/hillary-clinton-hauls-delegates-bernie-sanders-expense-super-tuesday-n529941|title=Super Tuesday: Hillary Clinton Hauls in Delegates But Bernie Sanders Fights On|author=Seitz-Wald, Alex|publisher=NBC News|date=March 2, 2016|access-date=March 28, 2016}}</ref> At the end of the day, Clinton collected 518 pledged delegates to Sanders' 347, taking her lead to 609–412, a difference of 197 pledged delegates.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/hillary-clintons-got-this/|title=Hillary Clinton's Got This|work=FiveThirtyEight|last1=Enten|first1=Harry|date=March 2, 2016|access-date=March 28, 2016}}</ref>

Sanders found more hospitable ground on the weekend of March 5, 2016, winning caucuses in [[Kansas Democratic caucuses, 2016|Kansas]], [[Maine Democratic caucuses, 2016|Maine]] and [[Nebraska Democratic caucuses, 2016|Nebraska]] by significant margins.

DNC officials including chairman [[Tom Perez]] pointed out that the same joint-fundraising agreement had been offered to Sanders and applied only to the general election; however, the Clinton campaign also had a second agreement that granted it additional, unusual oversight over hiring and policy, even though the text of the agreement insisted on the DNC's impartiality and focus on the general election.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2017/11/03/561976645/clinton-campaign-had-additional-signed-agreement-with-dnc-in-2015|title=Clinton Campaign Had Additional Signed Agreement With DNC In 2015|last=Detrow|first=Scott|publisher=NPR|date=November 3, 2017|access-date=June 2, 2019}}</ref> Brazile later denied that the primary was rigged, because "no votes were overturned," but described herself as "very upset" about a DNC–Clinton fundraising agreement.<ref>Shelbourne, Mallory (November 14, 2017).

=====Russian involvement=====
After the general election, the U.S. intelligence community and the [[Special Counsel investigation (2017–2019)|Special Counsel investigation]] assessed that the leaks were part of a larger [[Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections|interference campaign by the Russian government]] to cause political instability in the United States and to damage the Hillary Clinton campaign by bolstering the candidacies of Donald Trump, Bernie Sanders, and Jill Stein.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/16/us/politics/russia-mueller-election.html|title=Inside a 3-Year Russian Campaign to Influence U.S. Voters|last1=Shane|first1=Scott|last2=Mazzetti|first2=Mark|date=February 16, 2018|work=The New York Times|access-date=May 16, 2018|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref><ref name=RepJan6>{{cite web |url=https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/ICA_2017_01.pdf |title=Assessing Russian Activities and Intentions in Recent US Elections |date=January 6, 2017 |publisher=[[Office of the Director of National Intelligence]] |access-date=May 16, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Entous |first1=Adam |last2=Nakashima |first2=Ellen |last3=Miller |first3=Greg |title=Secret CIA assessment says Russia was trying to help Trump win White House |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/obama-orders-review-of-russian-hacking-during-presidential-campaign/2016/12/09/31d6b300-be2a-11e6-94ac-3d324840106c_story.html |access-date=11 July 2018 |work=The Washington Post |date=9 December 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Collins |first1=Michael |title=Indictment: Russians also tried to help Bernie Sanders, Jill Stein presidential campaigns |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/02/17/indictment-russians-also-tried-help-bernie-sanders-jill-stein-presidential-campaigns/348051002/ |access-date=July 11, 2018 |work=USA Today |date=February 17, 2018}}</ref> The Russian government is alleged to have promoted Sanders beginning in 2015 as a way to weaken or defeat Clinton, who Russian President [[Vladimir Putin]] opposed.

==Campaign finance==
This is an overview of the money used in the campaign as it is reported to [[Federal Election Commission]] (FEC) and released on April 27, 2016. Outside groups are [[independent expenditure]] only committees—also called [[Political action committee|PACs and SuperPACs]]. Several such groups normally support each candidate, but the numbers in the table are a total of all of them. This means that a group of committees can be shown as [[Insolvency|technically insolvent]] (shown in red) even though it is not the case of all of them. The Campaign Committee's debt is shown in red if the campaign is technically insolvent. The source of all the numbers is [[Center for Responsive Politics]].<ref>{{cite web|title=2016 Presidential Race|url=http://www.opensecrets.org/pres16/ |website=OpenSecrets.org - Center for Responsive Politics|access-date=February 26, 2016}}</ref> Some spending totals are not available, due to withdrawals before the FEC deadline.

==Process==
{{See also|United States presidential primary#Process}}

The Democratic Party presidential primaries and caucuses are [[indirect election]]s in which voters elect delegates to the [[2016 Democratic National Convention]]; these delegates in turn directly elect the Democratic Party's presidential nominee. In some states, the party may disregard voters' selection of delegates or selected delegates may vote for any candidate at the state or national convention (''non-binding'' primary or caucus). In other states, state laws and party rules require the party to select delegates according to votes, and delegates must vote for a particular candidate (''binding'' primary or caucus). There are 4,051 pledged delegates and 714 [[superdelegate]]s in the 2016 cycle.<ref name="auto1">{{cite web |title=Democratic National Committee, 2016 Democratic National Convention Delegate/Alternate Allocation|url=https://ballotpedia.org/wiki/images/c/ce/Appendix_B_-_Allocation_Chart_1.29.16.pdf.pdf|archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20160624201100/https%3A//ballotpedia.org/wiki/images/c/ce/Appendix_B_%2D_Allocation_Chart_1.29.16.pdf.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-date=June 24, 2016|access-date=March 28, 2016}}</ref>  Under the party's delegate selection rules, the number of pledged delegates allocated to each of the 50 U.S. states and [[Washington, D.C.]] is determined using a formula based on three main factors:
# The proportion of votes each state gave to the Democratic candidate in the last three presidential elections (2004, 2008, and 2012)
# The number of electoral votes each state has in the [[United States Electoral College]].
# The stage of the primary season when they held their contest. States and territories that held their contests later are given bonus seats.
A candidate must win 2,383 delegates at the national convention, in order to win the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination.<ref name="auto1"/> For the U.S. territories of [[Puerto Rico Democratic caucus, 2016|Puerto Rico]], [[American Samoa Democratic caucus, 2016|American Samoa]], [[Guam Democratic caucus, 2016|Guam]], the [[United States Virgin Islands Democratic caucuses, 2016|U.S. Virgin Islands]] and for [[Democrats Abroad primary, 2016|Democrats Abroad]], fixed numbers of pledged delegates are allocated. All states and territories then must have used a [[proportional representation]] system, where their pledged delegates were awarded proportionally to the election results.<ref name="greenpapersDEMDelegates">{{cite web|url=http://www.thegreenpapers.com/P16/D-Alloc.phtml |title=Democratic Detailed Delegate Allocation – 2016|work=The Green Papers|access-date=September 14, 2015}}</ref> A candidate must receive at least 15% of the popular vote to win pledged delegates in a state. The current 714 unpledged superdelegates (or "soft" delegates) included members of the [[United States House of Representatives]] and [[United States Senate|Senate]], state and territorial [[List of current United States Governors|governors]], members of the Democratic National Committee, and other party leaders. Because of possible deaths, resignations, or the results of intervening or special elections, the final number of these superdelegates may be reduced before the convention.<ref name="greenpapersDEMDelegates"/> The Democratic National Committee also imposed rules for states that wished to hold early contests in 2016. No state was be permitted to hold a primary or caucus in January and only Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina, and Nevada were entitled to February contests. Any state that violated these rules were penalized half its pledged delegates and all its superdelegates to the 2016 convention.<ref name="greenpapersDEMDelegates"/>

The following are the results of candidates that won at least one state. These candidates were on the ballots for every state, territory and federal district contest. The results of caucuses did not always have attached preference polls and attendance was extremely limited. The unpledged delegate count did not always reflect the latest declared preferences.

==Superdelegate endorsements==
{{Main|List of Democratic Party superdelegates, 2016}}

[[Superdelegates]] are elected officials and members of the [[Democratic National Committee]] who vote at the [[2016 Democratic National Convention|Democratic National Convention]] for their preferred candidate. Also known as ''unpledged delegates,'' they comprise 15% of the convention (712 votes out of 4,763) and they may change their preference at any time. The table below reflects current public endorsements of candidates by superdelegates, as detailed and sourced in the [[#Schedule and results|full list]] above. Because commonly referenced estimates of superdelegate support, including those by [[CNN]]<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/election/ |title=2016 Election Center - Presidential Primaries and Caucuses|publisher=CNN}}</ref> and the [[Associated Press|AP]],<ref name="interactives.ap.org">{{cite news|url=http://interactives.ap.org/2016/delegate-tracker/?apikey=uSsHZA4dlPsWwDRHDAndAwIIQZ8OQgug |title=Delegate Tracker|work=Associated Press}}</ref> do not identify individual delegates as supporting a given candidate, their published tallies may differ from the totals computed here.
