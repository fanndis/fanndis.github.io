'''Euronews''' is a pan-European pay television [[news broadcasting|news]] network, headquartered in [[Lyon]], [[France]]. The network began broadcasting on 1 January 1993 and aimed to cover world news from a [[Pan-European identity|pan-European]] perspective.

It is jointly owned by several European and [[North Africa]]n public and state-owned broadcasting organizations, and is currently majority-owned (88%) by Media Globe Networks, led by Egyptian billionaire [[Naguib Sawiris]], who is the chairman of the supervisory board. It is also a provider of [[live streaming world news]], which can be viewed via its website, on [[YouTube]], and on various [[mobile device]]s and [[digital media player]]s.

==History and organisation==
In 1992, following the [[Gulf War|Persian Gulf War]], during which [[CNN]]'s position as the preeminent source of [[24-hour news cycle|24-hour news]] programming was cemented, the [[European Broadcasting Union]] decided to establish Euronews to present information from a European perspective. The channel's first broadcast was on 1 January 1993 from [[Écully]], Lyon. An additional broadcast studio was set up in London in 1996. It was founded by a group of ten public broadcasters:<ref>{{cite book|last1=Collins|first1=Richard|title=From Satellite to Single Market: New Communication Technology and European Public Service Television|publisher=Routledge|year=1998|location=London|pages=130|isbn=9780415179706}}</ref>

The shareholders are represented by the '''SOCEMIE''' ({{lang-fr|Société éditrice de la chaîne européenne multilingue d'information Euronews}}) [[consortium]]. Euronews SA is the operating company that produces the channel and holds the broadcasting licence. It is currently co-owned by seven out of the ten founders and:

In late 1997, the British news broadcaster [[ITN]] purchased a 49% share of Euronews for £5.1&nbsp;million from [[Alcatel-Lucent]].<ref>{{cite news|title=ITN Acquires 49% Euronews Stake|date=1 December 1997|url=https://www.telecompaper.com/news/itn-acquires-49-euronews-stake--124079|work=Telecom Paper|access-date=5 June 2012}}</ref> ITN supplied the content of the channel along with the remaining shareholders.

The broadcast switched from solely [[Analog transmission|analogue]] to mainly [[Digital data|digital]] transmission in 1999. That same year, a Portuguese audio track was added. A Russian audio track was added in 2001, following VGTRK joining as one of the major shareholders.

In April 2003, ITN sold its stake in Euronews as part of its drive to streamline operations and focus on news-gathering rather than channel management.<ref name="BroadcastMagazine">{{cite news|url=https://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/news/multi-platform/news/itn-drops-out-of-euronews-channel/1116586.article|title=ITN Drops Out of Euronews Channel|newspaper=[[Broadcast (magazine)|Broadcast]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/transparency/regdoc/rep/2/2003/EN/2-2003-792-EN-3-0.Pdf|title=EuroNews: Contribution by the Commission|date=2003|access-date=15 July 2020|publisher=[[European Commission]]}}</ref>

On 6 February 2006, Ukrainian public broadcaster [[UA:PBC|Natsionalna Telekompanya Ukraïny (NTU)]] purchased a one percent interest in SOCEMIE.<ref name="digitalspy">{{cite web|url=https://www.digitalspy.com/media/a28857/ntu-becomes-20th-euronews-shareholder/|title=NTU Becomes 20th EuroNews Shareholder|date=5 February 2006|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]}}</ref>

In 2007, Euronews won the European Commission's tender for an Arabic-language news channel, with a service agreement being signed on 6 December. The Arabic service would eventually be launched in July 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://aib.org.uk/euronews-heads-for-arabic-markets/|title=EuroNews heads for Arabic markets|publisher=AIB|date=10 December 2007|access-date=15 July 2020}}</ref>

On 27 May 2008, Spanish public broadcaster [[RTVE]] decided to leave Euronews, citing legal requirements to maintain low debt levels through careful spending as a factor influencing its decision to leave, as well as to promote its international channel [[TVE Internacional]].<ref name="elmundo">{{cite news|url=https://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2008/06/05/comunicacion/1212656729.html|title=TVE abandona EuroNews|language=es|date=5 February 2006|newspaper=[[El Mundo (Spain)|El Mundo]]}}</ref>

In February 2009, the Turkish public broadcaster [[Turkish Radio and Television Corporation|TRT]] became a shareholder in the channel and joined its supervisory board.<ref>{{cite news|title=Turkey's TRT joins Euronews supervisory board|date=15 September 2009|url=https://www.worldbulletin.net/archive/turkeys-trt-joins-euronews-supervisory-board-h47271.html|work=World Bulletin|access-date=5 June 2012}}</ref> TRT purchased 15.70% of the channel's shares and became the fourth main partner after France Télévisions (23.93%), RAI (21.54%), and [[All-Russia State Television and Radio Broadcasting Company|VGTRK]] (16.94%). Subsequently, Turkish was added as the ninth language service in January 2010. Later that year in October, the channel started broadcasting in Persian, then began broadcasting in 16:9 widescreen format in early 2011, and launched a Ukrainian service in August.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20110208006158/en/euronews-international-news-channel%C2%A0takes-new-dimension-2011|date=8 February 2011|access-date=15 July 2020|publisher=[[Business Wire]]|title=euronews, the international news channel, takes on a new dimension in 2011}}</ref> A Polish service was launched in mid-2011 amid Poland's accession to the [[Presidency of the Council of the European Union]], although only some selected evening broadcasts were translated.

In February 2015, the channel's executive board approved a bid by Media Globe Networks, owned by Egyptian telecom magnate [[Naguib Sawiris]], to acquire a 53% controlling stake in the media outlet. The deal raised questions over Euronews's future editorial posture and independence.<ref>{{cite news|title=Egyptian Mogul Plans to Buy Controlling Stake in Europe's Answer to CNN|date=27 February 2015|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/egyptian-mogul-sawiris-buy-euronews-778229|work=The Hollywood Reporter|access-date=25 March 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Controversial ventures pose questions for Euronews|date=24 March 2015|url=https://euobserver.com/news/128098|work=EU Observer|access-date=25 March 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Euronews investor Naguib Sawiris: we will resist state interference|date=27 February 2015|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/feb/27/euronews-investor-naguib-sawiris-we-will-resist-state-interference|work=The Guardian|access-date=25 March 2015}}</ref>

On 13 March 2015, it was announced that Inter Media Group, owned by pro-Russian Ukrainian oligarch [[Dmytro Firtash]], had taken over the Ukrainian service. In response, the Ukrainian government decided to revoke its broadcasting license for its suspected bias and dropped its funding.<ref>{{cite news|title=Ukraine bans Euronews|date=20 March 2015|url=https://www.euractiv.com/section/global-europe/news/ukraine-bans-euronews/|work=EURACTIV.com|access-date=14 July 2020}}</ref> Firtash later abandoned the project, resulting in the department shutting down and leaving 17 journalists redundant. The Russian service, which was financed by Moscow, refused to provide jobs to the journalists, in violation of French labour legislation. The management explained that not hiring any Ukrainian journalists was a specific instruction from VGTRK.<ref>{{cite news|title=Row over Moscow 'blocking' Ukrainian journalists at Euronews|date=10 October 2016|url=https://www.euractiv.com/section/europe-s-east/news/row-over-moscow-blocking-ukrainian-journalists-at-euronews/|work=EURACTIV.com|access-date=14 July 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Euronews journalists, technicians clash with management|date=8 December 2016|url=https://www.euractiv.com/section/digital/news/euronews-journalists-technicians-clash-with-management/|work=EURACTIV.com|access-date=14 July 2020}}</ref>

In October 2015, Euronews moved to a new global headquarters complex in La Confluence, Lyon, designed by Paris architecture firm [[Jakob + MacFarlane]] and covering a floor area of 10,000m².<ref>{{cite web|title=jakob + macfarlane completes green cube building for euronews' HQ|url=https://www.designboom.com/architecture/jakob-macfarlane-green-cube-euronews-headquarters-lyon-confluence-france-10-16-2015/|publisher=designboom.com|access-date=15 July 2020}}</ref>

===Radio service===
On 2 October 2012, Euronews launched Euronews Radio. The service was designed for viewers for whom "watching news is not an option" by providing a direct simulcast to the TV channel, with the "No Comment" segment being replaced by music. The music of the bulletin openings is also transmitted on Euronews Radio. Weather reports are read by a female announcer.

===Africanews===
{{main|Africanews}}
In January 2014, Euronews announced a partnership with public broadcaster Télé Congo "under the auspices of the President of the Republic of the Congo, Mr. [[Denis Sassou Nguesso]]" to create Africanews.<ref>{{cite news|title=Euronews links to Congo's president under scrutiny|date=21 October 2015|url=https://www.euractiv.com/section/global-europe/news/euronews-links-to-congo-s-president-under-scrutiny/|work=EURACTIV.com|access-date=14 July 2020}}</ref> The website debuted on 4 January 2016, with the Africanews TV channel eventually launching on 20 April, broadcasting in English and French from [[Pointe-Noire]] in the Republic of the Congo.<ref>{{cite news|title=Africanews is LIVE online!|url=https://www.africanews.com/2016/01/04/africanews-is-live-online-tv-follows-in-february//|date=4 January 2016|work=Africanews|access-date=14 July 2020}}</ref>

In 2020, Euronews originally planned to sell Africanews to a group known as Sipromad, but the deal eventually fell through and the two parties are now in litigation. As a result, Africanews would remain under the ownership of its sister channel, but its production would move from Pointe-Noire to the global headquarters in Lyon by the end of July 2020, with a reduction in costs of at least 30%.<ref>{{cite news|title=Euronews to keep African service|url=https://www.broadbandtvnews.com/2020/07/15/euronews-to-keep-african-service/|date=15 July 2020|work=Broadband TV News|first=Chris|last=Dziadul}}</ref>

===Partnership with NBC===
[[File:Euronews HQ ©euronews photo Stéphane Audras 2015.10.15 (169).JPG|thumb|Euronews headquarters in Lyon]]

In November 2016, the channel's executive board was in talks with [[NBCUniversal]], the parent company of [[NBC News]], for a "strategic partnership". NBCU would acquire 15 to 30% ownership of the Euronews network, would contribute to Euronews content, and facilitate NBC News' expanded operations in Europe.<ref>{{cite news|title=NBC News, Euronews in Talks for Strategic Partnership|date=11 November 2016|url=https://variety.com/2016/tv/global/nbc-news-euronews-talks-strategic-partnership-1201915855/|work=Variety Media|access-date=11 November 2016}}</ref> After successful negotiations with the [[European Commission]], who feared that the partnership would result in an ''Americanization'' of Euronews, the NBCUniversal News Group finally purchased a 25% stake in Euronews in February 2017 for $30&nbsp;million. NBC News president [[Deborah Turness]] was appointed to head up international operations, and incumbent Euronews CEO Michael Peters, who had led it since 2004, became CEO of the new partnership. Both report directly to NBC News chairman [[Andrew Lack (executive)|Andrew Lack]]. The resulting partnership became known as Euronews NBC.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Palmeri|first1=Christopher|title=NBC Acquires Stake in Euronews, Taps U.S. News Chief to Lead It|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-02-14/nbc-acquires-stake-in-euronews-taps-u-s-news-chief-to-lead-it|access-date=17 February 2017|publisher=Bloomberg L.P.|date=14 February 2017}}</ref>

Although Sawiris and NBC News have the largest stakes in Euronews, editorial control by SOCEMIE members has been assured, with the broadcasters having seven slots in the editorial board, as opposed to Sawiris' company (which has three slots) and NBC News, which only has one, thereby reducing rumors of an ''Americanization'' of Euronews' values. Editorial control is fully handled by Euronews' teams, with NBC only focusing on planning and coordinating tasks.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.lefigaro.fr/flash-eco/2017/05/31/97002-20170531FILWWW00300-euronews-le-rapprochement-avec-nbc-finalise.php|title=Euronews: le rapprochement avec NBC finalisé (in French)|date=31 May 2017|work=Le Figaro}}</ref> After the formation of the partnership, video reports from NBC News' properties began to appear frequently on the TV channel and reports from [[NBCNews.com]] began to be distributed on its digital platforms.

On 9 May 2017, Euronews split its service into 12 language-specific editions, of which nine have a linear TV channel with its own language voiceover, but now including contents, on-air graphics (except for some segments) and its lower-third news ticker in the language. The ''glocal'' strategy allows the language editorial teams to personalize the content and presentation of their channel, not only by sharing own-produced content with other languages but by producing content that is relevant to local audiences and allowing local reporters and presenters to appear on camera in all its language editions. The splitting process finished on 24 May 2017.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.panoramaaudiovisual.com/2017/05/10/euronews-reinventa-su-oferta-de-difusion-y-digital/|title=Euronews reinventa su oferta de difusión y digital (in Spanish)|date=10 May 2017|website=Panorama Audiovisual}}</ref>

Alongside the major language split, satellite distribution for the German, Spanish, Portuguese and Turkish channels was discontinued, now being only available via fiber-optic IP uplink.<ref name=":0" /> The discontinuation of the German-language channel on satellite in particular generated outcry from many German satellite TV owners, resulting in its restoration on the [[Astra 1L]] satellite on 25 July 2017, via an unencrypted SD feed sitting alongside the French-language channel.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.broadbandtvnews.com/2017/07/26/euronews-puts-german-channel-back-on-satellite/|title=Euronews puts German channel back on satellite|last=Krieger|first=Jörn|date=26 July 2017|work=Broadband TV News}}</ref> Additionally, the Arabic and Persian-language editions became available only on Euronews' website and apps as well as on social media, with TV broadcasting being discontinued, and the Ukrainian edition was discontinued outright, due to lack of funding from the Ukrainian government, as well as due to the controversy surrounding the ownership of its broadcasting licence.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telesatellite.com/actu/49612-fin-de-la-version-ukrainienne-euronews.html|title=Fin de la version ukrainienne d'Euronews (in French)|date=23 May 2017|work=Télé Satellite et Numérique}}</ref> The Turkish-language TV channel would eventually be axed entirely as well, following discontinued support from TRT, who wanted to prioritise its own international news channel, [[TRT World]].<ref>{{cite news|language=fr|url=https://www.trt.net.tr/francais/turquie/2017/03/23/turquie-trt-rompt-son-alliance-avec-euronews-697605|work=TRT Français|title=Turquie: TRT rompt son alliance avec Euronews|access-date=25 August 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|title=Commission to 'look seriously' at Euronews mess|url=https://www.euractiv.com/section/digital/news/commission-to-look-seriously-at-euronews-mess/|date=14 February 2017|access-date=15 July 2020|work=EURACTIV.com}}</ref> Finally, the Euronews channel in English would become known as the ''World'' edition, and distribution to premises in the American continent via fiber-optic IP uplink was set to begin later in 2018.<ref name=":0" /> These changes caused the elimination of 43 staff positions, mainly from the Ukrainian edition, causing major layoffs and leading to production staff having more flexible roles.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://lexpansion.lexpress.fr/actualites/1/actualite-economique/euronews-43-departs-a-l-issue-du-plan-de-sauvegarde_1911482.html|title=Euronews: 43 départs à l'issue du plan de sauvegarde (in French)|date=24 May 2017|work=L'Express-L'Expansion}}</ref>

In 2018, Euronews' English-language channel began to gradually revamp its programming schedule, with the roll-out of a new slate of presenter-led programming to complement its already existing shows, a move that was reported earlier in the year, after the success of its presenter-led special reports and weekly programming introduced in recent years.<ref name=":1">{{Cite news|url=https://www.a516digital.com/2018/01/big-changes-for-euronews-in-2018.html|title=Big changes for Euronews in 2018|date=2 January 2018|work=a516digital|archive-date=16 December 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191216102914/https://www.a516digital.com/2018/01/big-changes-for-euronews-in-2018.html}}</ref> Alongside conventional rolling news shows with newsreaders, debate programming, talk shows, and new presenter-led long-form shows began to be offered during the weekly schedule, and throughout programs, Euronews reporters from different nationalities will be offering context on stories close to their respective home nationalities.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thedrum.com/opinion/2017/05/11/euronews-overhauls-its-broadcasting-strategy-bid-become-the-unrivalled-chronicler|title=Euronews overhauls its broadcasting strategy in bid to become the unrivaled chronicler of Europe|last=Burrell|first=Ian|date=11 May 2017|work=The Drum}}</ref>

The roll-out began on 22 May, when Euronews debuted the first of these new shows, ''Good Morning Europe'', a five-hour morning show which airs every weekday morning from 7 am. It was first anchored by former [[RT (TV network)|RT]] correspondent and [[TVB Pearl]] news presenter Tesa Arcilla, who anchored it on a temporary basis. Some weeks later, former [[France 24]] presenter Belle Donati began presenting the show, alternating with Arcilla; after she moved to [[Brussels]] in September, she became the main anchor of the slot. Two months later, on 17 July, Euronews debuted a six-hour breaking news show, ''Euronews Now'', anchored by Tokunbo Salako, covering the dayside and afternoon slots. On 3 September, the new evening program lineup was launched, starting with a politics-focused show, ''Raw Politics'', hosted from [[Brussels]] by Tesa Arcilla, and featuring former [[Sky News]] reporter Darren McCaffrey. It also spawned a weekly spin-off, ''Raw Politics: Your Call'', a phone-in show which featured European Parliament members answering viewers' questions by phone or social media. The show was dropped over a year later, on October 2019, due to low viewership, with its content being integrated into the rolling news programming. Two weeks after the launch of ''Raw Politics'', on 17 September, the full roll-out was completed with the introduction of a 5-hour evening rolling news show, ''Euronews Tonight'', initially presented by former [[Sky News]] and [[BBC News]] presenter [[Sam Naz]], and later by Euronews veteran Isabelle Kumar, who has worked in the channel since 2003.<ref name=":2">{{Cite news|url=https://www.thedrum.com/opinion/2018/08/09/inside-euronews-nbc-fresh-rolling-news-channel-striving-help-save-united-europe|title=Inside Euronews NBC: a fresh rolling news channel striving to help save united Europe|last=Burrell|first=Ian|date=9 August 2018|work=The Drum}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Isabelle Kumar|url=https://www.wise-qatar.org/biography/isabelle-kumar/|access-date=2020-11-14|website=WISE|language=en-US}}</ref> The traditional pre-produced blocks of video content still remains on some late-nights and weekends. Most overnights now repeat the previous day's edition (either full or half-length) of ''Euronews Now''.

New weekly programming is also being produced, including the weekly interview series ''Uncut'', which feature conversations from political leaders and newsmakers worldwide with minimum to no editing. The first episodes feature German-French politician [[Daniel Cohn-Bendit]] interviewing former [[UK Independence Party|UKIP]] leader [[Nigel Farage]] and former [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|UK Prime Minister]] [[Tony Blair]] about [[Brexit]]. Additionally, a new social media unit was created, with journalists with a background on digital news verification leading it. The newly-created team help to produce ''The Cube'', a social media segment during rolling news shows, focusing on analysis on treatment and reactions about news headlines on social media, with special attention at the major stories of the day. ''No Comment'', a long-standing element of Euronews' programming, remains on the channels' schedule, and it's being gradually integrated into the rolling news shows on the English-language channel.<ref name=":2" />

Additionally, a major investment in mobile reporting via [[iPhone]] devices helped Euronews gain a major [[Scoop (news)|scoop]], becoming the only TV news outlet worldwide to broadcast live coverage from the [[Aquarius Dignitus|MV Aquarius]], with Paris correspondent Annelise Borges (formerly with [[France 24]]) on assignment. Borges broadcast live for 10 days as the new Italian far-right government denied the Aquarius access to Italian ports. The coverage made headlines on many news outlets worldwide and helped Euronews boost its credibility and its audience.<ref name=":2" /> The new Euronews also hired new correspondents in London, Berlin, Moscow, Rome, Madrid and Washington D.C., and gained access to NBC News' large network of correspondents worldwide. 

As of September 2018, the other language editions are unaffected, with the pre-produced blocks of video content remaining at all times, but with programming dayparts being now named with proper translations of the existing daypart programming of the World edition (i.e. the evening daypart being named ''Euronews am Abend'', ''Euronews Noite'', ''Euronews Soir''...). There were plans to introduce presenter-led programming during the morning slots on these other channels, eventually, the evening daypart in most of the language-specific channels became presenter-led by late 2018; all of these editions are pre-recorded and pre-produced before broadcast, and eventually looped through the night.<ref name=":1" />

===Post-NBC===
On 20 April 2020, it was reported that NBCUniversal had sold its stake in Euronews to Media Globe Networks, eventually having an overall majority share of 88%. NBCUniversal's parent company [[Comcast]] had recently acquired pan-European satellite service [[Sky Group]], and was prioritizing a collaboration between NBC News and [[Sky News]] on a new international news channel.<ref>{{Cite web|title=NBC sells stake in Euronews as focus shifts to new global TV channel|url=https://www.ft.com/content/0f5d1cbe-a94e-4801-ab23-6480e487e6ee|access-date=21 April 2020|website=Financial Times}}</ref> The proposed service was scrapped in August due to redundancies related to the [[COVID-19 pandemic]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=Kanter|first=Jake|last2=Kanter|first2=Jake|date=2020-08-06|title=Comcast Abandons Plan To Launch International News Channel NBC Sky World News|url=https://deadline.com/2020/08/comcast-shelves-nbc-sky-world-news-1203005882/|access-date=2020-11-14|website=Deadline|language=en-US}}</ref>

The channel is available in 430&nbsp;million households in 166 countries worldwide. It reaches more than 170&nbsp;million European households by [[cable television|cable]], [[satellite television|satellite]] and [[terrestrial television|terrestrial]]. It also began to secure availability on [[multimedia]] platforms such as [[Internet Protocol television|IPTV]] and digital media.<ref name="MediaPressPack">{{cite news|url=http://www.euronews.com/media/the-station/mediapackpress_EN.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131126032901/http://www.euronews.com/media/the-station/mediapackpress_EN.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-date=26 November 2013|title=Euronews Media Presspack|access-date=27 June 2010|newspaper=Euronews}}</ref>

Euronews launched an application for mobile devices ([[Android (operating system)|Android]], [[iPhone]], and [[iPad]]) which is called "Euronews Live". The application is free of charge and is available on Google Play and the App Store.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.euronews.com/services/euronews-live-app/|title=euronews live application|access-date=20 August 2011|newspaper=Euronews|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308144516/http://www.euronews.com/services/euronews-live-app/|archive-date=8 March 2012}}</ref> This app was later shut down quietly.

The following broadcasters have also simulcasted, or are currently simulcasting Euronews through terrestrial channels for a limited amount of time:

In 2012, the largest Belarusian state network MTIS stopped broadcasting Euronews for unknown reasons.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://naviny.by/rubrics/society/2012/01/01/ic_news_116_383897|script-title=ru:В сети МТИС прекращена трансляция канала "Евроньюс"|access-date=5 June 2012|date=1 January 2012|publisher=Naviny|language=ru}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://euroradio.fm/ru/report/v-minske-otklyuchayut-euronews-87163|title=В Минске отключают Euronews|access-date=5 June 2012|date=31 December 2011|publisher=Euroradio|language=ru}}</ref>

In 2013, the new commercial channel Planet TV started broadcasting Euronews dubbed in Slovenian after Antenna TV SL purchased a major stake in the company. Euronews airs after closedown (or sign-off) of Planet TV, but both call sign logos are displayed.

In September 2016, Euronews disappeared from the [[Freesat]] channel list in the UK, in a move made by Sawiris.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160929113453/http://www.a516digital.com/2016/09/satellite-update-sky-q-by-default.html|title=Satellite Update: SkyQ by default, Freesat withdrawals|date=26 September 2016|website=a516digital|access-date=3 November 2016}}</ref>

In September 2017, VGTRK ceased simulcasting Euronews to expand broadcasting hours of [[Russia-K]] channel.

===Franchise===
Since 2018, Euronews has begun licensing its name to private and public broadcasters in central and eastern Europe, where, subsequently, localized Euronews channels broadcast regional, national, European and international news in local languages. The first of these channels was the launch of Euronews Albania.

*'''Euronews Albania''' 
In 2019, Euronews launched its first franchise through a joint venture with local [[IN TV (Albania)|RTV In]] in Albania. The new channel known as Euronews Albania is based in [[Tirana]], [[Albania]] and covers the Western Balkans countries of Albania, Montenegro, Kosovo, and North Macedonia.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.innovationmcc.com/post/euronews-launches-albanian-franchise-airing-in-2019|title=Euronews launches Albanian franchise airing in 2019|website=www.innovationmcc.com}}</ref>

*'''Euronews Georgia'''
In 2020, Euronews is planning on launching a channel in Georgian, with a scheduled launch date of autumn 2020.<ref name="auto">{{Cite web|url=https://www.euronews.com/about|title=About Euronews, corporate information|website=euronews}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://emerging-europe.com/news/euronews-georgia-to-start-broadcasting-in-2020/|title=Euronews Georgia to start broadcasting in 2020|first=Dominik|last=Istrate|date=19 September 2019|website=Emerging Europe &#124; Intelligence, Community, News}}</ref>

*'''Euronews Serbia''' 
In 2019, Euronews teamed up with local media group HD-WIN, owned by [[Mts (Telekom Srbija)|Mts]], to launch a channel in Serbian. The new channel is planned to start broadcasting sometime in late 2020.<ref name="auto"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://emerging-europe.com/news/euronews-teams-up-with-hd-win-to-launch-serbian-channel/|title=Euronews teams up with HD-WIN to launch Serbian channel|first=Emerging|last=Europe|date=15 July 2019|website=Emerging Europe &#124; Intelligence, Community, News}}</ref>

===HD===
[[High-definition television|High-definition]] (HD) broadcasting was started on 2 November 2016 via satellite using [[Hot Bird]]-capacities (English audio only). Regarding the audio codec, Euronews originally used the [[Dolby Digital|AC3]] format, before changing to the [[Advanced Audio Coding|AAC]] codec in March 2017, and changing again to the MPEG codec in April 2017.<ref>{{cite web|title=digitalbitrate|url=https://www.digitalbitrate.com/files/s21/S21_11565_801_a.png?v=1493887506|publisher=digitalbitrate.com|access-date=7 May 2017}}</ref>

==Logos==
[[File:Euronews logo globe.png|135px|thumb|right|Identifying graphic used with logo below]]
[[File:Euronews logo text.svg|135px|thumb|right|Logo used from October 1998 to June 2008]]
[[File:Euronews grey logo.svg|135px|thumb|right|Logo used from June 2008 to May 2016]]

The current Euronews logo is the fifth. From 1 January 1993 to February 1999 the logo was in the lower right corner of the screen, from February 1999 to June 2008 it was in the upper left corner of the screen, from June 2008 to May 2016 it was in the upper right corner of the screen, and from May 2016 to present it has been in the lower-left corner of the screen.

*January 1993{{snd}}September 1996: blue lower case word "euro" in a yellow parallelogram and yellow capital word "NEWS".
*September 1996{{snd}}February 1999: white lower case word "euro" above and blue lower case word "news" below.
*February 1999{{snd}}June 2008: blue rectangle enclosing white camel case word "EuroNews".
*June 2008{{snd}}May 2016: white lowercase word "euronews" on a neutral grey background featuring a white circle symbolizing both the world and star circle on the flag of Europe.
*{{As of|2016|May|alt=Since}} May 2016: silver-white lower case word "euronews", with "news" in a bolder font, followed by a small circle at the foot of the last letter, all on a light navy background.

In January 2016, Euronews was accused of plagiarism by the Congolese media group AfricaNews,<ref name="auto1">{{cite web|url=https://www.jeuneafrique.com/mag/294349/economie/euronews-accuse-de-plagiat-groupe-kinois/|title=Africanews – Euronews accusé de plagiat|date=25 January 2016}}</ref> because the Lyon-based channel used the logo "Africanews" for its African subsidiary in 2016. However, AfricaNews in the Democratic Republic of Congo has existed since 2005 and can be found on the Internet. Its employees sent letters to French authorities and managing director of Euronews, Michael Peters, to change the related logo and not to use it for the African subsidiary of Euronews.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.africanewsrdc.net/featured/africanews-vs-euronews-affaire-de-plagiat/|title=AfricaNews vs Euronews: affaire de plagiat|first=Rédaction|last=AfricaNews|date=25 January 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.digitalbusiness.africa/rd-congo-euronews-accuse-de-plagiat-avec-africanews/|title=RD Congo : Euronews accusé de plagiat Avec AfricaNews|first=TIC MagTIC|last=Mag|date=8 February 2016}}</ref><ref name="auto1"/>
