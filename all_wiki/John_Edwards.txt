He was the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] nominee for Vice President in [[2004 United States presidential election|2004]], and was a candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination in [[Democratic Party presidential primaries, 2004|2004]] and [[Democratic Party presidential primaries, 2008|2008]].

Edwards defeated incumbent [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Lauch Faircloth]] in North Carolina's [[United States Senate election in North Carolina, 1998|1998 Senate election]]. Toward the end of his six-year term, he opted to retire from the Senate and focus on a Democratic campaign in the [[2004 United States presidential election|2004 presidential election]]. He eventually became the 2004 Democratic candidate for vice president, the running mate of presidential nominee Senator [[John Kerry]] of [[Massachusetts]].

Following Kerry's loss to incumbent President [[George W. Bush]], Edwards began working full-time at the One America Committee, a [[political action committee]] he established in 2001, and was appointed director of the Center on Poverty, Work and Opportunity at the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]] [[University of North Carolina School of Law|School of Law]]. He was also a consultant for [[Fortress Investment Group]] LLC.

Following his 2008 campaign, Edwards was [[indicted]] by a federal [[grand jury]] on June 3, 2011, on six felony charges of violating multiple federal [[Campaign finance in the United States|campaign contribution laws]] to cover up an [[John Edwards extramarital affair|extramarital affair]] to which he eventually admitted. He was found not guilty on one count, and the judge declared a mistrial on the remaining five charges, as the jury was unable to come to an agreement.<ref name=Mistrial/> The Justice Department dropped the remaining charges and did not attempt to retry Edwards.<ref name="WashingtonPost061312">{{cite news |last=Roig-Franzia |first=Manuel |title=John Edwards will not be retried, Justice Department announces |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/john-edwards-will-not-be-retried-justice-department-announces/2012/06/13/gJQAfbeiaV_story.html |access-date=June 18, 2012 |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |date=June 13, 2012}}</ref> He was not convicted of a crime, but the revelation that he engaged in an extramarital affair and fathered a child while his wife, [[Elizabeth Edwards|Elizabeth]], was dying of cancer gravely damaged his public image and ended his career in politics.

==Early life and education==
[[File:Edwards (2109671160).jpg|thumb|right|Edwards and his parents stand in front of his childhood home]]
Edwards was born on June 10, 1953, to Wallace Reid Edwards and Catharine Juanita "Bobbie" Edwards (née Wade) in [[Seneca, South Carolina]]. The family moved several times during Edwards's childhood, eventually settling in [[Robbins, North Carolina]], where his father worked as a [[textile mill]] floor worker and was eventually promoted to supervisor. His mother had a roadside antique-finishing business and then worked as a [[mail|letter carrier]] when his father left his job.<ref name="from_mill_town">{{cite news |url=https://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2003/10/05/from_mill_town_to_the_national_stage_boston_globe/?page=full |title=From Mill Town to the National Stage |work=[[The Boston Globe]] |author=Patrick Healy |date=October 5, 2003 |access-date=March 27, 2007}}</ref>  The family attended a Baptist church.<ref>http://www.nbcnews.com/id/20478398/ns/politics-mens_vogue/t/does-edwards-have-what-it-takes/#.XIsOOS2ZPMI</ref>

He attended [[Clemson University]] for one semester before transferring to [[North Carolina State University]]. He graduated from NCSU with high honors with a [[bachelor's degree]] in textile technology and a 3.8 [[Grading (education)#United States|GPA]] in 1974, and later earned his [[Juris Doctor]] from the [[University of North Carolina School of Law]] (UNC) with honors.

==Legal career==
After law school, Edwards [[Law clerk|clerked]] for federal judge [[Franklin Dupree]] in North Carolina, and in 1978 became an associate at the [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] law firm of Dearborn & Ewing, doing primarily trial work, defending a Nashville bank and other corporate clients.<ref name=PewResearch>{{cite web |title=Religion and Politics '08: John Edwards |url=http://www.pewforum.org/2008/11/04/religion-and-politics-08-john-edwards/ |website=Pew Research Center |access-date=11 April 2015 |format=Religion and Public Life |date=4 November 2008}}</ref><ref name="EdwardsTrialWork"/> [[Lamar Alexander]], a Republican and future governor of and U.S. Senator from Tennessee, was among Edwards's co-workers.<ref name="big little guys"/> The Edwards family returned to North Carolina in 1981, settling in the capital of [[Raleigh, North Carolina|Raleigh]], where he joined the firm of Tharrington, Smith & Hargrove.<ref name="EdwardsTrialWork">{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/01/31/politics/campaign/31EDWA.html |title=In Trial Work, Edwards Left a Trademark |work=The New York Times |author=Adam Liptak and Michael Moss |date=January 31, 2004 |access-date=May 21, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090424115607/http://www.nytimes.com/2004/01/31/politics/campaign/31EDWA.html |archive-date=April 24, 2009}}</ref><ref name="big little guys">{{cite web |last=de la Cruz |first=Bonna |title=Edwards has represented big as well as little guys |url=http://www.thetennessean.com/government/archives/04/07/53958158.shtml?Element_ID=53958158 |work=The Tennessean |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040719210753/http://www.thetennessean.com/government/archives/04/07/53958158.shtml?Element_ID=53958158 |archive-date=July 19, 2004 |date=July 8, 2004}}</ref>

In 1984, Edwards was assigned to a [[medical malpractice]] lawsuit that had been perceived to be unwinnable; the firm had accepted it only as a favor to an attorney and state senator who did not want to keep it. Nevertheless, Edwards won a $3.7 million verdict on behalf of his client, who had suffered permanent brain and nerve damage after a doctor prescribed an overdose of the anti-alcoholism drug [[Antabuse]] during alcohol aversion therapy.<ref name="findlaw">{{cite web |url=http://news.findlaw.com/newsmakers/john.edwards.html |title=John Edwards |publisher=FindLaw |date=n.d. |access-date=March 25, 2007}}</ref> In other cases, Edwards sued the [[American Red Cross]] three times, alleging transmission of AIDS through tainted blood products, resulting in a confidential settlement each time, and defended a North Carolina newspaper against a libel charge.<ref name="EdwardsTrialWork"/>

In 1985, Edwards represented a five-year-old child born with cerebral palsy – a child whose mother's doctor did not choose to perform an immediate [[Caesarean section|Caesarean delivery]] when a fetal monitor showed she was in distress. Edwards won a $6.5 million verdict for his client, but five weeks later, the presiding judge sustained the verdict, but overturned the award on grounds that it was "excessive" and that it appeared "to have been given under the influence of passion and prejudice", adding that in his opinion "the evidence was insufficient to support the verdict."<ref name="EdwardsTrialWork"/> He offered the plaintiffs $3.25 million, half of the jury's award, but the child's family appealed the case and received $4.25 million in a settlement.<ref name="EdwardsTrialWork"/> Winning this case established the North Carolina precedent of physician and hospital liability for failing to determine if the patient understood the risks of a particular procedure.<ref name="findlaw"/>

After this trial, Edwards gained national attention as a plaintiff's lawyer. He filed at least twenty similar lawsuits in the years following, and achieved verdicts and settlements of more than $60 million for his clients. Similar lawsuits followed across the country. When asked about an increase in Caesarean deliveries nationwide, perhaps to avoid similar medical malpractice lawsuits, Edwards said, "The question is, would you rather have cases where that happens instead of having cases where you don't intervene and a child either becomes disabled for life or dies in utero?"<ref name="EdwardsTrialWork"/>

In 1993, Edwards began his own firm in Raleigh (now named Kirby & Holt) with a friend, David Kirby. He became known as the top plaintiffs' attorney in North Carolina.<ref name="EdwardsTrialWork" /> The biggest case of his legal career was a 1996 product liability lawsuit against Sta-Rite, the manufacturer of a defective pool drain cover. The case involved Valerie Lakey, a three-year-old girl<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.wral.com/news/local/story/160341/ |title=Defense Rests in Pool Drain Lawsuit |publisher=WRAL |date=December 17, 1996 |access-date=July 19, 2008}}</ref> who was disemboweled by the suction power of the pool drain pump when she sat on an open pool drain whose protective cover had been removed by other children at the pool, after the swim club had failed to install the cover properly. Despite 12 prior suits with similar claims, Sta-Rite continued to make and sell drain covers lacking warnings. Sta-Rite protested that an additional warning would have made no difference because the pool owners already knew the importance of keeping the cover secured.

In his closing arguments, Edwards spoke to the jury for an hour and a half and made reference to his son, Wade, who had been killed shortly before testimony began.{{clarify|date=February 2016}} Mark Dayton, editor of ''North Carolina Lawyers Weekly'', would later call it "the most impressive legal performance I have ever seen."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/2001/0110.green.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20011007071335/http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/2001/0110.green.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=October 7, 2001 |title=John Edwards, Esq. |publisher=Washington Monthly |author=Joshua Green |date=January 10, 2001 |access-date=March 25, 2007 }}</ref> The jury awarded the family $25 million, the largest personal injury award in North Carolina history. The company settled for the $25 million while the jury was deliberating additional [[punitive damages]], rather than risk losing an appeal. For their part in this case, Edwards and law partner David Kirby earned the [[Association of Trial Lawyers of America]]'s national award for public service.<ref name="findlaw" /> The family said that they hired Edwards over other attorneys because he alone had offered to accept a smaller percentage as his fee unless the award was unexpectedly high, while all of the other lawyers they spoke with said they required the full one-third fee. The size of the jury award was unprecedented, and Edwards did receive the standard one-third-plus-expenses fee typical of contingency cases. The family was so impressed with his intelligence and commitment<ref name="EdwardsTrialWork"/> that they volunteered for his Senate campaign the next year.

After Edwards won a large verdict against a trucking company whose worker had been involved in a fatal accident, the North Carolina legislature passed a law prohibiting such awards unless the company had specifically sanctioned the employee's actions.<ref name="EdwardsTrialWork"/>

In December 2003, during his first presidential campaign, Edwards (with [[John Auchard]]) published ''[[Four Trials]]'', an autobiographical book focusing on cases from his legal career. According to this book, the success of the Sta-Rite case and his son's death (Edwards had hoped his son would eventually join him in private law practice) prompted Edwards to leave the legal profession and seek public office.{{citation needed|date=August 2008}}

Edwards, his daughter Cate, and David Kirby started a new law firm in 2013, named Edwards Kirby, with offices in Raleigh and in Washington, D.C.<ref>[http://www.wral.com/edwards-to-rejoin-former-law-partner/13117129/ WRAL.com: Edwards teaming up again with former law partner] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303233217/http://www.wral.com/edwards-to-rejoin-former-law-partner/13117129/ |date=March 3, 2016 }}</ref><ref>[http://edwardskirby.com/ Edwards Kirby Law Firm: Equality In Justice] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161004222154/http://edwardskirby.com/ |date=October 4, 2016}}</ref>

==Political career==

===Policy positions===
{{main|Political positions of John Edwards}}
Edwards promotes programs to eliminate poverty in the United States, including arguing in favor of creating one million housing vouchers over five years in order to place poor people in middle-class neighborhoods.

Although Edwards initially supported the Iraq War, he later changed his position and in November 2005 wrote an [[op-ed]] in ''[[The Washington Post]]'' in which he said he expressed regret for voting for the [[Iraq War Resolution]] and discussed three solutions for success in the conflict.<ref name="WashpoOpEd">{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/11/11/AR2005111101623.html |title=The Right Way in Iraq |author=John Edwards |work=The Washington Post |page=B07 |date=November 13, 2005 |access-date=December 18, 2007}}</ref> He denounced the "[[Iraq War troop surge of 2007|troop surge]]" in Iraq, was a proponent for withdrawal, and urged Congress to withhold funding for the war without a withdrawal timetable.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/POLITICS/05/23/democrats.dilemma/index.html |title=Dems in tough spot with war funding bill |publisher=[[CNN]] |date=May 24, 2007 |access-date=May 24, 2007}}</ref>

===Senate tenure===
[[Image:John Edwards on Meet The Press.jpg|thumb|upright|Senator Edwards on ''[[Meet the Press]]'']]
Edwards won election to the U.S. Senate in 1998 as a Democrat running against incumbent Republican Senator [[Lauch Faircloth]]. Despite originally being the underdog, Edwards beat Faircloth by 51.2% to 47.0% — a margin of some 83,000 votes.

During [[President of the United States|President]] [[Bill Clinton]]'s [[Impeachment of Bill Clinton|1999 impeachment trial in the Senate]], Edwards was responsible for the [[deposition (law)|deposition]] of witnesses [[Monica Lewinsky]] and fellow Democrat [[Vernon Jordan, Jr.]] During the 2000 presidential campaign, Edwards was on Democratic nominee [[Al Gore]]'s vice presidential nominee short list (along with [[John Kerry]] and [[Joe Lieberman]], Gore's eventual pick).<ref>{{cite news|last=Rudin|first=Ken|title=Sen.

In his time in the Senate, Edwards co-sponsored 203 bills.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/?Db=d107&querybd=@FIELD(FLD004+@4((@1(Sen+Edwards++John))+01573)): | title=Search Results | publisher=The Library of Congress | access-date=March 25, 2007}}</ref> Among them was Lieberman's 2002 [[Iraq War]] Resolution (S.J.Res.46), which he co-sponsored along with 15 other senators, but which did not go to a vote.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d107:SJ00046:@@@P: | title=S.J.RES.46 | publisher=The Library of Congress | access-date=March 25, 2007}}</ref> He voted for replacement resolution (H.J Res. 114) in the full Senate to authorize the use of military force against Iraq, which passed by a vote of 77 to 23,<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=107&session=2&vote=00237 | title=U.S. Senate Roll Call Votes: H.J Res. 114 | publisher=United States Senate | access-date=December 18, 2007}}</ref> On October 10, 2002, he stated that:

{{quote|Almost no one disagrees with these basic facts: that Saddam Hussein is a tyrant and a menace; that he has weapons of mass destruction and that he is doing everything in his power to get nuclear weapons; that he has supported terrorists; that he is a grave threat to the region, to vital allies like [[Israel]], and to the United States; and that he is thwarting the will of the international community and undermining the United Nations' credibility.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://quote.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=10000103&sid=apXyrHjc4RSs&refer=us | title=Edwards Says He Still Would Have Voted to Authorize War in Iraq | author=Jay Newton-Small and Laurence Arnold | publisher=Bloomberg News | date=October 11, 2004 | access-date=August 17, 2007 | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930064943/http://quote.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=10000103&sid=apXyrHjc4RSs&refer=us | archive-date=September 30, 2007 | df=mdy-all }}</ref>}}

He defended his vote on an October 10, 2004, appearance on ''[[Meet the Press]]'', saying "I would have voted for the resolution knowing what I know today, because it was the right thing to do to give the president the authority to confront [[Saddam Hussein]] ... I think Saddam Hussein was a very serious threat. I stand by that, and that's why [John Kerry and I] stand behind our vote on the resolution".<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/6200928 | title=Meet the Press transcript for October 10, 2004}}</ref> However, he subsequently changed his mind about the war and apologized for that military authorization vote. Edwards also voted in favor of the [[Patriot Act]].

Among other positions, Edwards was generally [[pro-choice]] and supported [[affirmative action]] and the [[Capital punishment in the United States|death penalty]]. One of his first sponsored bills was the ''Fragile X Research Breakthrough Act of 1999''.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c106:S.1131.IS: | title=Fragile X Research Breakthrough Act of 1999 | publisher=Library of Congress | date=May 26, 1999 |access-date=March 25, 2007}}</ref> He was also the first person to introduce comprehensive anti-spyware legislation with the ''Spyware Control and Privacy Protection Act''.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d106:SN03180:@@@L&summ2=m& | title=S.3180 | publisher=The Library of Congress | access-date=March 25, 2007}}</ref> He advocated rolling back the [[George W.

Edwards served on the [[U.S. Senate Select Committee on Intelligence]], the [[U.S. Senate Committee on Judiciary]], and was a member of the [[New Democrat Coalition]].

Before the [[United States Senate election in North Carolina, 2004|2004 Senate election]], Edwards announced his retirement from the Senate and supported [[Erskine Bowles]], former [[White House Chief of Staff]], as the successor to his seat; Bowles, however, was defeated by Republican [[Richard Burr]] in the election.

===Post-Senate activities===
The day after his concession speech, he announced his wife Elizabeth had been diagnosed with breast cancer. Edwards told interviewer [[Larry King]] that he doubted he would return to practice as a trial lawyer and showed no interest in succeeding [[Terry McAuliffe]] as the [[Democratic National Committee]] chairman.

In February 2005, Edwards headlined the "100 Club" Dinner, a major fundraiser for the [[New Hampshire]] Democratic Party. That same month, Edwards was appointed as director of the Center on Poverty, Work and Opportunity at the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]] for studying ways to move people out of poverty. That fall, Edwards toured ten major universities in order to promote "Opportunity Rocks!", a program aimed at getting youth involved to fight poverty.

On March 21, 2005, Edwards recorded his first [[podcast]]<ref name=Podcast>{{cite web |title=Sen. John Edward's Podcast |url=http://www.learnoutloud.com/Podcast-Directory/Politics/U.S.-Government/Sen-John-Edwards-Podcast/6875 |website=Learn Out Loud |access-date=11 April 2015 |date=2008}}</ref> with [[Elizabeth Anania Edwards|his wife]]. Several months later, in August, Edwards delivered an address to a potential key supporter in the Iowa caucus, the [[AFL-CIO]] in [[Waterloo, Iowa]].

In the following month, Edwards sent an email to his supporters and announced that he opposed the nomination of Judge [[John G. Roberts]] to become [[Chief Justice of the United States]]. He was also opposed to the nomination of Justice [[Samuel Alito]] as an Associate Justice and Judge Charles Pickering's appointment to the Federal bench.

During the summer and fall of 2005, he visited [[homeless shelter]]s and job training centers and spoke at events organized by [[Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now|ACORN]], the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People|NAACP]] and the [[Service Employees International Union|SEIU]].

===2004 presidential campaign===
{{main|United States presidential election, 2004|John Edwards presidential campaign, 2004}}
In 2000, Edwards unofficially began his presidential campaign when he began to seek speaking engagements in [[Iowa]], the site of the nation's [[Iowa caucuses|first party caucuses]]. On January 2, 2003, Edwards began [[fundraising]] without officially campaigning by forming an exploratory committee. On September 15, 2003, Edwards fulfilled a promise he made a year earlier as a guest on ''[[The Daily Show with Jon Stewart]]'' to unofficially announce his intention to seek the [[Democratic Party (United States) presidential primaries, 2004|2004 Democratic presidential nomination]]. The next morning, Edwards made the announcement officially from his hometown. He declined to run for reelection to the Senate in order to focus on his presidential run. Edwards's campaign was chaired by North Carolina Democratic activist [[Ed Turlington]].

As Edwards had been building support essentially since his election to the Senate, he led the initial campaign fundraising, amassing over $7 million during the first quarter of 2003 – more than half of which came from individuals associated with the legal profession, particularly Edwards's fellow trial lawyers, their families, and employees.<ref>[http://www.hillnews.com/news/050703/edwards.aspx ''Hill News''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070214164525/http://www.hillnews.com/news/050703/edwards.aspx |date=February 14, 2007}}, May 7, 2003</ref>

Edwards's [[Stump speech (politics)|stump speech]] spoke of "[[Two Americas]]", with one composed of the wealthy and privileged, and the other of the hard-working common man, causing the media to often characterize Edwards as a [[populist]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A30354-2004Jul6.html |title=Kerry picks Edwards as running mate: Mass. senator calls ex-rival a man of middle-class values |author=Jim VandeHei and Dan Balz |work=The Washington Post |date=July 6, 2004 |access-date=April 1, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/3872003.stm |title=Kerry and Edwards start campaign |publisher=BBC News |date=July 7, 2004 |access-date=April 1, 2008}}</ref>

Edwards struggled to gain substantial support, but his poll numbers began to rise steadily weeks before the Iowa caucuses. In these he had a surprising second-place finish with the support of 32% of delegates, behind only [[John Kerry]]'s 39% and ahead of former front-runner [[Howard Dean]] at 18%. One week later in the [[New Hampshire primary]], Edwards finished in fourth place behind Kerry, Dean and [[Wesley Clark]], with 12%. During the February 3 primaries, Edwards won the South Carolina primary,<ref>[http://www.thegreenpapers.com/P04/SC-D.phtml#0203 South Carolina Democratic Delegation 2004] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303205903/http://www.thegreenpapers.com/P04/SC-D.phtml#0203 |date=March 3, 2016}}. Thegreenpapers.com. Retrieved on June 3, 2011.</ref> lost to Clark in [[Oklahoma]], and lost to Kerry in the other states. Edwards garnered the second-largest number of second-place finishes, again falling behind Clark.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2004/primaries/pages/dates/02/03/index.html |title=Primary results: February 3 |publisher=CNN |access-date=May 24, 2010}}</ref>

[[Image:John-Edwards-Shakes-Hands.jpg|left|thumb|Edwards on the campaign trail in 2004]]
Dean withdrew from the contest, leaving Edwards the only major challenger to Kerry. In the [[Wisconsin]] primary on February 17, Edwards finished second to Kerry with 34% of the vote.

He largely avoided attacking Kerry until a February 29, 2004, debate in New York, in which he characterized him as a "Washington insider" and mocked Kerry's plan to form a committee to examine [[trade agreement]]s.

In the [[Super Tuesday]] primaries on March 2, Kerry finished well ahead in nine of the ten states voting, and Edwards's campaign ended. In [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], Edwards finished only slightly behind Kerry but, failing to win a single state, chose to withdraw from the race. He announced his official withdrawal at a press conference in [[Raleigh, North Carolina]], on March 3. Edwards's withdrawal made major media outlets relatively early on the evening of Super Tuesday, at about 6:30&nbsp;pm CST, before polls had closed in California and before caucuses in [[Minnesota]] had even begun. It is thought that the withdrawal influenced many people in Minnesota to vote for other candidates, which may partially account for the strong Minnesota finish of [[Dennis Kucinich]].{{original research inline|date=September 2007}} Edwards did win the presidential [[straw poll]] conducted by the [[Independence Party of Minnesota]].

After withdrawing from the race, he went on to win the April 17 Democratic caucuses in his home state of<!--home state of North Carolina on April 17 is correct; birth state of South Carolina was on February 3 and is shown above. Please don't change this as it is correct--> North Carolina,<ref>[http://www.thegreenpapers.com/P04/NC-D.phtml North Carolina Democratic Delegation 2004] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303200412/http://www.thegreenpapers.com/P04/NC-D.phtml |date=March 3, 2016}}.

===2004 vice presidential nomination===
{{main|John Kerry 2004 presidential campaign}}
On July 6, 2004, Kerry announced that Edwards would be his running mate; the decision was widely hailed in public opinion polls and by Democratic leaders. Though many Democrats supported Edwards's nomination, others criticized the selection for Edwards's perceived lack of experience. In the vice presidential debate, [[Dick Cheney]] told Edwards they had never met because of Edwards's frequent absences from the Senate, but that was later proven to be incorrect. Videotape later surfaced of Cheney and Edwards shaking hands off-camera during a taping of ''[[Meet the Press]]'' on April 8, 2001.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://archive.boston.com/news/politics/debates/articles/2004/10/07/photos_undermine_cheneys_assertion_he_never_met_edwards/ |title=Photos undermine Cheney's assertion he never met Edwards - The Boston Globe |website=archive.boston.com |access-date=2019-11-03}}</ref> On February 1, 2001, Cheney thanked Edwards by name and sat with him during a Senate prayer breakfast.

The judge also ruled that an alleged "sex tape" of Edwards and Hunter be destroyed by the court. The judge also allowed only the materials already in the public domain to be used for public purposes.
