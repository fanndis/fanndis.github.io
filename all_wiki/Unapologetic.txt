The album's first half is made up of [[electronic dance music|EDM]] and "syrupy" [[Southern hip hop]] minimalism<ref>{{cite news|last=Ritchie|first=Kevin|date=November 22, 2012|url=http://www.nowtoronto.com/music/story.cfm?content=189805|title=Rihanna&nbsp;— Unapologetic|newspaper=[[Now (newspaper)|Now]]|location=Toronto|volume=32|issue=12|accessdate=January 12, 2013}}</ref> songs, which feature abrasive sound effects and eccentric beats.<ref name="McCormick" /> Like most of the album, they generally draw on [[dubstep]], a bass-heavy subgenre typified by wobbly [[synthesizer|synthetic]] noises and blaring [[Drop (music)|bass drops]], as well as [[dance-pop]] and [[chopped and screwed]] sounds.<ref name="Roberts" /> Jon Caramanica of ''[[The New York Times]]'' characterizes the album's music as "brutish and bruised" with "tough and [[Overproduction (music)|layered]]" production, citing David Guetta's "guttural" production on "Phresh Out the Runway" and "Right Now" as an example.<ref name="Caramanica" /> Music journalist [[Jude Rogers]] characterized the album's music as voluminous "R&B-pop",<ref name="Rogers">{{cite news|last=Rogers|first=Jude|authorlink=Jude Rogers|date=November 24, 2012|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/nov/25/rihanna-unapologetic-review|title=Rihanna: Unapologetic – review|newspaper=[[The Observer]]|location=London|accessdate=July 6, 2014}}</ref> while ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine's Melissa Locker said that it has an "urban R&B sound".<ref>{{cite journal|last=Locker|first=Melissa|url=http://entertainment.time.com/2012/11/21/learning-to-love-rihannas-new-album-in-five-easy-steps/|title=Learning to Love Rihanna's New Album in Five Easy Steps|date=November 21, 2012|journal=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|location=New York|accessdate=July 7, 2014}}</ref> According to [[Alexis Petridis]], the different producers who worked on ''Unapologetic'' appeared to make an effort away from Rihanna's previous "pop-dance template&nbsp;... or at least to rearrange voguish sounds into less familiar shapes".<ref name="Petridis" /> ''Unapologetic''{{'}}s ballad-oriented second half incorporates [[disco]], [[reggae]], and [[rock music|rock]] styles.<ref name="McCormick" /> According to music critic [[Greg Kot]], ''Unapologetic'' is "ostensibly" a [[Pop music|pop]] album,<ref name="Kot" /> while ''[[Vibe (magazine)|Vibe]]'' said that it is "on the surface" an assortment of genres such as R&B, dubstep and pop.<ref name="vibe" />

Up-tempo songs such as "Phresh Out the Runway", "[[Jump (Rihanna song)|Jump]]", and "Pour It Up" celebrate [[wikt:carpe diem|carpe diemic]] [[hedonism]].<ref name="Kot" /> Much of the album's lyrics are presumably concerned with Rihanna's relationship with [[Chris Brown (American entertainer)|Chris Brown]],<ref name="Petridis" /> with a second half of lighter songs that have references to a dysfunctional love life.<ref name="Henderson" /> The album's subject matter is reflected by an abundance of [[minor key]] sounds throughout its songs.<ref name="Hopper" /> James Reed of ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' called ''Unapologetic'' "a defiant middle finger to her critics, particularly the ones who don’t approve of her relationship with Brown."<ref name="Reed" /> Kot observed a "celebrity subtext" throughout the album and characterized the songs' narrators as "troubled, anxiety-ridden, lost ... the characters in these songs linger in a limbo of mixed emotions, emotionally attracted to a lover and yet uneasy about the next step."<ref name="Kot" /> ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' magazine's Caryn Ganz wrote that "Rihanna sings about her unapologetic love of" money, love, and "living in the moment" on the songs "Pour It Up", "Loveeeeeee Song", and "Right Now", respectively.<ref name="Ganz" />

''Unapologetic'' received mixed to positive reviews from [[music journalism|music critics]].<ref name="sinha" /> At [[Metacritic]], which assigns a [[standard score|normalized]] rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album holds an [[weighted mean|average]] score of 61, which indicates "generally favorable reviews", based on 25 reviews.<ref name="Metacritic" /> Alexis Petridis of ''[[The Guardian]]'' found it "far more interesting" sonically than ''Talk That Talk'' and stated, "there's stuff here that's worth hearing, if you could untangle the music from the artist's personal life."<ref name="Petridis" /> ''[[Fact (UK magazine)|Fact]]'' magazine's Alex Macpherson felt that it has some of Rihanna's most compelling songs since ''[[Rated R (Rihanna album)|Rated R]]'' (2009) and that, "even when ''Unapologetic'' fails, it often does so in interesting ways" musically.<ref name="Macpherson" /> [[AllMusic]]'s Andy Kellman opined that "the only way to enjoy a significant portion of it is by taking it as pure entertainment" and called it "another timely refresh of contemporary pop music".<ref name="Kellman" />

Dan Martin of ''[[NME]]'' commented that, "at its best, ''Unapologetic'' trades in daring avant pop", and dubbed Rihanna the "most compelling of pop phenomena".<ref name="Martin" /> Jon Dolan of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' asserted that "''Unapologetic''{{'}}s stark, shadowy R&B is confrontationally honest and sung within an inch of its life".<ref name=rollingstone /> Jon Caramanica of ''[[The New York Times]]'' felt that it "makes the most of [Rihanna's] talent" and stated, "even on the most vulnerable songs, she maintains her cool, never once verging on the maudlin."<ref name="Caramanica" /> Smokey Fontaine of ''[[The Huffington Post]]'' called it "kinetic and musically varied", and wrote that it "blasts the sounds of global, post-[[Mod (subculture)|mod]] youth culture through every track".<ref name="Fontaine" />

In a mixed review, Genevieve Koski of ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' criticized Rihanna for "extend[ing] the album's defiant tone to her romantic life" and called it "a fiery pop album that's unfortunately coated in the icky residue of unearned defiance that has marked Brown’s recent output."<ref name="Koski" /> Randall Roberts of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' felt that its commercial "lyrical turns poison" the album, "even while musically, Rihanna has evolved into one of the more forward-thinking pop divas."<ref name="Roberts" /> [[Simon Price]] of ''[[The Independent]]'' panned Rihanna's singing as "[[flat (music)|flatter]] than [[Norfolk]]" and its material "dull as dishwater", observing "the usual half-hearted, sexual single-entendres".<ref name="Price" />

Greg Kot of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' wrote, "in the context of an album dominated by ballads and at least superficially introspective lyrics", the dubstep songs "feel like respites".<ref name="Kot" /> [[Slant Magazine]]'s Eric Henderson commented that the album sounds "cobbled together" and quipped, "If only the music were compelling enough to back up the supreme bad faith" of the lyrics.<ref name="Henderson" /> [[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]'s Jessica Hopper dismissed its music as "synth-pop slog" and said that the songs "make for dull labor, not worth our time and not befitting Rihanna's talent".<ref name="Hopper" /> In his consumer guide for [[MSN Music]], [[Robert Christgau]] facetiously called her "so much more provocative as an android than as a human being". He cited "Phresh Out the Runway", "Diamonds", and "Numb" as highlights, and gave the album a three-star honorable mention,<ref name="Odds and Ends 030" /> which indicates "an enjoyable effort consumers attuned to its overriding aesthetic or individual vision may well treasure".<ref name="CG 90s: Key to Icons" />
