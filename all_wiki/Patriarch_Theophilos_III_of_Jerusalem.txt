Theophilos (also spelled ''Theofilos'' or ''Theophilus'') was elected unanimously on 22 August 2005 by the [[Holy Synod of Jerusalem]] as the 141st [[primate (bishop)|primate]] of the Orthodox Church of Jerusalem to succeed the deposed [[Patriarch Irenaios|Irenaios I]]. His election was confirmed by the [[Eastern Orthodox]] [[synod]] of [[Constantinople]], and was endorsed by [[Jordan]] on 24 September 2005, as one of the three governments whose endorsement is required.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cosmos.ucc.ie/cs1064/jabowen/IPSC/php/art.php?aid=26545 |title=Jordan issues royal decree endorsing new Orthodox patriarch in Jerusalem (journal article) |publisher=Cosmos.ucc.ie |date= |accessdate=2015-02-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141217193844/http://cosmos.ucc.ie/cs1064/jabowen/IPSC/php/art.php?aid=26545 |archive-date=2014-12-17 |url-status=dead }}</ref> He was enthroned on 22 November 2005, despite [[Israel]]i objection.

Theophilos is regarded as having been more favorable to his deposed predecessor, which may assist him in bringing stability to the troubled patriarchate as Irenaios's supporters may thus unite around him and make peace with the synod. Upon his election, Theophilos said, "In the last few months we have had a lot of problems but with the help of [[God]] we will overcome them."<ref>[http://www.cjp.org/content_display.html?ArticleID=161070 ]{{dead link|date=February 2015}}</ref>

Theophilos  was formerly the Eastern Orthodox [[Archbishop]] of [[Mount Tabor|Tabor]].

In 1964, Ilias moved to Jerusalem.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jerusalem-patriarchate.info/main/eng/page/%CE%B2%CE%B9%CE%BF%CE%B3%CF%81%CE%B1%CF%86%CE%B9%CE%BA%CE%BF-%CF%80%CE%B1%CF%84%CF%81%CE%B9%CE%B1%CF%81%CF%87%CE%B7 |title=Jerusalem Patriarchate |publisher=Jerusalem-patriarchate.info |accessdate=2015-02-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170916082207/http://www.jerusalem-patriarchate.info/main/eng/page/%CE%B2%CE%B9%CE%BF%CE%B3%CF%81%CE%B1%CF%86%CE%B9%CE%BA%CE%BF-%CF%80%CE%B1%CF%84%CF%81%CE%B9%CE%B1%CF%81%CF%87%CE%B7 |archive-date=2017-09-16 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

He served as [[archdeacon]] for then-patriarch [[Benedict I of Jerusalem]]. From 1991 to 1996, he was a [[priest]] in [[Kafr Kanna]] in [[Galilee]], which had a predominantly [[Arab Christians#Israel|Israeli Arab Christian]] community, there he also formed a society called "[[Nour al Masih]]" ("Light of Christ") to spread the Orthodox Christian faith throughout the region.

Theophilos studied [[theology]] at the [[University of Athens]]. He went on to complete an MA from [[Durham University]], graduating in 1984 as a member of [[University College, Durham|Castle]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Gazette, 1983/84 |url=http://reed.dur.ac.uk/xtf/view?docId=bookreader/DU_Gazettes/DUGazette1983-4/DUGazette19834METS.xml#page/114/mode/2up |website=Durham University |accessdate=20 April 2019 |page=114}}</ref> He has studied at [[Hebrew University]] in Jerusalem. Besides his native [[Greek language|Greek]], he also speaks [[English language|English]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and [[Hebrew]].

In 1996, he was one of the first [[Christians|Christian]] [[clergymen]] in centuries to make an opening into the closed [[Wahhabi]] [[Islamic]] society of [[Qatar]], an area historically{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}} under the jurisdiction of the Orthodox Church of Jerusalem where many [[Palestinian Arab]] migrant workers live today, a considerable number of them Orthodox Christians. He subsequently served as [[Exarch]] of the [[Holy Sepulchre]] in [[Qatar]].

From 2000 to 2003, he was church envoy to the [[Patriarchate of Moscow]] but mostly steered clear of Moscow, where the Patriarchate has an established [[metochion]].

Before becoming patriarch, Theophilos served for a short time as the [[Archbishop]] of Tabor, consecrated to the episcopacy by Irenaios in February 2005.

He was officially enthroned as Patriarch of Jerusalem and All Palestine<ref>[http://www.jerusalem-patriarchate.info/en/patria_welc.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100919115740/http://www.jerusalem-patriarchate.info/en/patria_welc.htm |date=September 19, 2010 }}</ref> on November 22, 2005.
