Over 22,000 people{{cn|date=August 2020}} live in the capital city, [[St. John's, Antigua and Barbuda|St. John's]]. The capital is situated in the north-west and has a deep harbour which is able to accommodate large cruise ships. Other leading population settlements are [[All Saints, Antigua and Barbuda|All Saints]] (3,412) and [[Liberta, Antigua|Liberta]] (2,239), according to the 2001 census.

[[English Harbour]] on the south-eastern coast provides protected shelter during violent storms. It is the site of a restored British colonial naval station named "[[Nelson's Dockyard]]" after Admiral [[Horatio Nelson]]. English Harbour and the neighbouring village of [[Falmouth, Antigua and Barbuda|Falmouth]] are  yachting and sailing destinations and provisioning centres.

=== Early Antiguans ===
The first inhabitants were the [[Guanahatabey people]]. Eventually, the [[Arawak peoples|Arawak]] migrated from the mainland{{where|date=January 2020|talk=yes|Mainland}}, followed by the [[Island Caribs|Carib]]. Prior to European colonialism, [[Christopher Columbus]] was the first European to visit Antigua, in 1493.<ref name=WDL1>{{cite web|title=A Plan of the Estate Called Jonas's Situated in the Division of North Sound in the Island of Antigua, the Property of Peter Langford Brooke, Esquire|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/647|publisher=[[World Digital Library]]|access-date=19 April 2013}}</ref>

The Arawak were the first well-documented group of indigenous people to settle Antigua. They paddled to the island by canoe (''piragua'') from present-day [[Venezuela]], pushed out by the Carib, another indigenous people. The Arawak introduced agriculture to Antigua and Barbuda. Among other crops, they cultivated the Antiguan "Black" pineapple. They also grew [[Maize|Corn]], [[Sweet potato]]es (white with firmer flesh than the bright orange "sweet potato" grown in the United States), [[Chili pepper]]s, [[Guava]], Tobacco, and Cotton.

Some of the vegetables listed, such as corn and sweet potatoes, continue to be staples of Antiguan cuisine. Colonists took them to Europe, and from there, they spread around the world. For example, a popular Antiguan dish, ''dukuna'' ({{IPA|/ˈduːkuːnɑː/}}), is a sweet, steamed dumpling made from grated sweet potatoes, flour and spices. Another staple, ''fungi'' ({{IPA|/ˈfuːndʒi/}}), is a cooked paste made of cornmeal and water.

Most of the Arawak left Antigua about A.D. 1100. Those who remained were raided by the Carib coming from Venezuela. According to ''The Catholic Encyclopedia'', the Caribs' superior weapons and seafaring prowess allowed them to defeat most Arawak nations in the West Indies. They enslaved some and cannibalised others.<ref name="Watson">{{Cite book|last=Watson |first=Jack Brierley |year=1979 |title=The West Indian Heritage: A history of the West Indies |location=London |publisher=Murray |pages=9–10 |isbn=978-0-7195-3541-3 }} See also ''The Catholic Encyclopedia'' entries for "[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01680c.htm Arawaks]" and "[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03348a.htm Caribs]".</ref> Watson points out that the Caribs had a much more warlike culture than the Arawak.<ref name="Watson" />

The indigenous people of the West Indies built excellent sea vessels, which they used to sail the Atlantic and Caribbean resulting in much of the South American and the Caribbean islands being populated by the Arawak and Carib. Their descendants live throughout South America, particularly Brazil, Venezuela and Colombia.

[[Christopher Columbus]] named the island "Antigua" in 1493 in honour of the "Virgin of the Old Cathedral"<ref name="LaAntig" /> ({{lang-es|La Virgen de la Antigua}}) found in [[Seville Cathedral]] in southern [[Spain]]. On his 1493 voyage, honouring a vow, he named many islands after different aspects of [[St. Mary]], including [[Montserrat]] and [[Guadeloupe]].

In 1632, a group of English colonists left St. Kitts to settle on Antigua. Sir Christopher Codrington, an Englishman, established the first permanent British settlement.<ref name=WDL1 /> The island rapidly developed as a profitable sugar colony. For a large portion of Antigua history, the island was considered Britain's "Gateway to the Caribbean". It was located on the major sailing routes among the region's resource-rich colonies. Lord [[Horatio Nelson]], a major figure in Antigua history, arrived in the late 18th century to preserve the island's commercial shipping prowess.{{clarify|date=September 2015}}

According to ''A Brief History of the Caribbean'',<ref>{{Cite book|last=Rogoziński |first=Jan |year=1999 |title=A Brief History of the Caribbean: From the Arawak and Carib to the Present |url=https://archive.org/details/briefhistoryofca00rogo_0 |url-access=registration |edition=second |location=New York |publisher=Facts on File |isbn=978-0-8160-3812-1}}</ref>{{Page needed|date=July 2018}} British diseases, malnutrition and slavery eventually destroyed the vast majority of the Caribbean's native population. There are some differences of opinions as to the relative importance of these causes.

=== Slavery ===
[[File:Digging the Cane-holes - Ten Views in the Island of Antigua (1823), plate II - BL.jpg|thumb|Slaves planting and tilling, 1823]]
[[File:The boiling house - Ten Views in the Island of Antigua (1823), plate VI - BL.jpg|thumb|Slaves working in the boiling house, 1823]]
[[File:Sugar-Hogsheads - Ten Views in the Island of Antigua (1823), plate X - BL.jpg|thumb|Slaves loading barrels into a boat, 1823]]

Sugar became Antigua's main crop in about 1674, when [[Christopher Codrington (died 1698)|Christopher Codrington]] (c 1640-1698) settled at [[Betty's Hope]] plantation. He came from Barbados, bringing the latest sugar technology with him. Betty's Hope, Antigua's first full-scale sugar plantation, was so successful that other planters turned from tobacco to sugar.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} This resulted in their importing [[slaves]] to work the [[sugar cane]] crops.<ref name=WDL1 />

According to ''A Brief History of the Caribbean'', many West Indian colonists initially tried to use locals as slaves. These groups succumbed easily to disease and/or malnutrition, and died by the thousands. The enslaved Africans adapted better to the new environment and thus became the number one choice of unpaid labour; they also provided medical services and skilled labour, including carpentry, for their masters. However, according to a [[Smithsonian Institution]] article, the West African slave population in the Caribbean also had a high mortality rate, which was compensated by regular imports of very high numbers of new slaves from West and Central Africa.<ref name="notreb?"/>

Sugar cane was one of the most grueling and dangerous crops slaves were forced to cultivate. Harvesting cane required backbreaking long days in sugar cane fields under the hot island sun. Sugar cane spoiled quickly after harvest, and the milling process was slow and inefficient, forcing the mill and boiling house to operate 24 hours a day during harvest season. [http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/ism/slavery/archaeology/caribbean/plantations/caribbean32.aspx]

Sugar mills and [[Boilery|boiling houses]] were two of the most dangerous places for slaves to work on sugar plantations. In mills wooden or metal rollers were used to crush cane plants and extract the juices. Slaves were at risk of getting their limbs stuck and ripped off in the machines.[http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/ism/slavery/archaeology/caribbean/plantations/caribbean33.aspx] Similarly, in sugar boiling houses slaves worked under extremely high temperatures and at the risk of being burned in the boiling sugar mixture or getting their limbs stuck.[http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/ism/slavery/archaeology/caribbean/plantations/caribbean34.aspx]

Today, collectors prize the uniquely designed colonial furniture built by West Indian slaves. Many of these works feature what are now considered "traditional" motifs, such as pineapples, fish and stylized serpents.

By the mid-1770s, the number of slaves had increased to 37,500, up from 12,500 in 1713. The British population had fallen from 5,000 to below 3,000.<ref>{{cite book|title=''A History of Antigua'' |author=Brian Dyde}}</ref> The slaves lived in wretched and overcrowded conditions and could be mistreated or even killed by their owners with impunity. The [[Slave Act of 1723]] made arbitrary murder of slaves a crime, but did not do much to ease their lives.<ref>Dyde, B. (2000). [https://www.amazon.com/History-Antigua-Unsuspected-Isle/dp/0333751698 A history of Antigua: The unsuspected isle.] Interlink Publishing Group Incorporated.</ref>

Unrest against enslavement among the Black Antiguans became increasingly common. In 1729, a man named Hercules was [[hanged, drawn and quartered|hanged, drawn, and quartered]] and three others were burnt alive, for conspiring to kill the slave owner Crump and his family. In 1736, an enslaved man called "Prince Klaas" (whose slave name was Court) allegedly planned an uprising in which British slavers would be massacred. Court was crowned "King of the [[Coromantees]]" in a pasture outside the capital of St. John's. The coronation appeared to be just a colourful spectacle but was, for the enslaved people, a ritual declaration of war on the British slavers. Due to information obtained from other slaves, colonists discovered the plot and suppressed it. Prince Klaas and four accomplices were caught and executed by the [[breaking wheel]]. (However, some doubts exist about Court's guilt.)<ref>{{cite web|last1=Dash|first1=Mike|title=A little bit of background – the crucifixion of Prince Klaas|url=http://allkindsofhistory.wordpress.com/2014/06/16/a-little-bit-of-background-the-crucifixion-of-prince-klaas/|website=allkindsofhistory.wordpress.com|access-date=12 July 2014}}</ref><ref name="notreb?"/> Six of the rebels were hanged in chains and starved to death, and another 58 were [[burned at the stake]].

The [[American War of Independence]] in the late 18th century disrupted the Caribbean sugar trade. At the same time, public opinion in [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] gradually turned against slavery.<ref>{{cite web |author=Oldfield, Dr John | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/empire_seapower/antislavery_01.shtml#two | date=17 February 2011 | title=British Anti-slavery}}</ref> "Traveling&nbsp;... at slavery's end, [Joseph] Sturge and [Thomas] Harvey (1838&nbsp;...) found few married slaves residing together or even on the same estate.

=== Horatio, Lord Nelson ===
[[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Horatio Nelson]] (who was created 1st Viscount Nelson in 1801) was Senior Naval Officer of the Leeward Islands from 1784 to 1787 on {{HMS|Boreas|1774|6}}. During his tenure, he tried to enforce the [[Navigation Acts]]. These acts prohibited trade with the newly formed United States of America. Most of the merchants in Antigua depended upon [[American trade]], so many of them despised Captain Nelson. As a result, he was unable to get a promotion for some time after his stint on the island.

Unlike the Antiguan merchants, Nelson had a positive view of the controversial Navigation Acts:<ref name=nelson>{{cite book|title=The Life of Horatio Lord Nelson|url=https://archive.org/details/thelifeofhoratio00947gut| author=Robert Southey|author-link=Robert Southey}}</ref>

<blockquote>The Americans were at this time trading with our islands, taking advantage of the register of their ships, which had been issued while they were British subjects. Nelson knew that, by the Navigation Act, no foreigners, directly or indirectly, are permitted to carry on any trade with these possessions. He knew, also, that the Americans had made themselves foreigners with regard to England; they had disregarded the ties of blood and language when they acquired the independence which they had been led on to claim, unhappily for themselves, before they were fit for it; and he was resolved that they should derive no profit from those ties now. Foreigners they had made themselves, and as foreigners they were to be treated.<ref name=nelson/></blockquote>
Nelson said: "The Antiguan Colonists are as great rebels as ever were in America, had they the power to show it."<ref name=nelson/>

A dockyard started in 1725, to provide a base for a squadron of British ships whose main function was to patrol the West Indies and thus maintain Britain's sea power, was later named "Nelson's Dockyard" in his honour.

While Nelson was stationed on Antigua, he frequently visited the nearby island of [[Nevis]], where he met and married a young widow, [[Frances Nelson|Fanny Nisbet]], who had previously married the son of a plantation family on Nevis.

=== 1918 labour unrest ===
Following the foundation of the [[Ulotrichian Universal Union]], a friendly society which acted as a trade union (which were banned), the sugar cane workers were ready to confront the plantation owners when they slashed their wages. The cane workers went on strike and rioted when their leaders were arrested.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rothermund|first=Dietmar|title=The Routledge Companion to Decolonization|year=2006|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-203-00264-3}}</ref>

=== Independence ===
In 1968, with [[Barbuda]] and the tiny island of [[Redonda]] as dependencies, Antigua became an associated state of the Commonwealth, and in 1981 it was disassociated from Britain.<ref name=WDL1 />

===U.S. government presence ===
Commissioned, 9 August 1956, the Naval Facility (NAVFAC) Antigua was one of the shore terminal stations that were part of the [[SOSUS|Sound Surveillance System]] (SOSUS) and the Integrated Undersea Surveillance System (IUSS), which were used to track Soviet submarines.  NAVFAC Antigua was decommissioned 4 February 1984.<ref>{{cite web |last=Commander, Undersea Surveillance |title=Naval Facility Antiqua August 1956 - February 1984|url=https://www.public.navy.mil/subfor/cus/Pages/NAVFAC_Antigua.aspx |access-date=16 February 2020}}</ref>

From 1958 through 1960 the United States installed the [[Missile Impact Location System]] (MILS) in the Atlantic Missile Range, later the [[Eastern Range]], to localize the splash downs of test missile nose cones. MILS was developed and installed by the same entities that had completed the first phase of the Atlantic SOSUS system. A MILS installation consisting of both a target array for precision location and a broad ocean area system for good positions outside the target area was installed at Antigua, {{cvt|1300|nmi| mi km}} down range.

Until July 7, 2015, the [[United States Air Force]] maintained a small base near the airport, designated Detachment 1, 45th Operations Group, [[45th Space Wing]] (known as Antigua Air Station).  The mission provided high rate telemetry data for the Eastern Range and its space launches.  The unit was deactivated due to US government budget cuts and the property given to the Antiguan Government.<ref>{{cite web|author=1st Lt.

{{Main|Demographics of Antigua and Barbuda}}

==Geography==
Located in the [[Leeward Islands]] Antigua has an area of {{convert|281|km2}} with {{convert|87|km}} of coastline. The highest elevation on the island is {{convert|402|m}}.

Various natural points, capes, and beaches around the island include: Boon Point, Beggars Point, Parham, Willikies, Hudson Point, English Harbour Town, Old Road Cape, Johnson's Point, Ffryes Point, Jennings, Five Islands, and Yepton Beach, and Runaway Beach.

Several natural harbours are formed by these points and capes, including: Fitches Creek Bay, between Beggars Point and Parham; Nonsuch Bay between Hudson Point and Willikies; Willoughby Bay, between Hudson Point and English Harbour Town; English Harbour leading into English Harbour Town; Falmouth Harbour recessing into Falmouth; Rendezvous Bay between Falmouth and Old Road Cape; Five Islands Harbour, between Jennings and Five Islands; and Green Bay, the main harbour at St. John's, between Yepton Beach and Runaway Beach.

===Fauna===
The [[Antiguan racer]] is among the rarest snakes in the world. The Lesser Antilles are home to four species of racers. All four have undergone severe range reductions; at least two subspecies are extinct and another, ''A. antiguae'', now occupies only 0.1 percent of its historical range.<ref name="Sajdaka & Henderson 1991">{{cite journal|last1=Sajdaka|first1=Richard A.|last2=Henderson|first2=Robert W.|title=Status of West Indian racers in the Lesser Antilles|journal=Oryx|date=1991|volume=25|issue=1|pages=33–38|doi=10.1017/s0030605300034049}}</ref>

[[Griswold's ameiva]] (''Ameiva griswoldi'') is a species of lizard in the genus [[Ameiva]]. It is endemic to Antigua and [[Barbuda]]. It is found on both islands.

==Governance==
{{expand section|date=October 2019}}
Local government is provided by six civil [[Parish (administrative division)|parish]]es: [[Saint George Parish, Antigua and Barbuda|St. George]], [[Saint Peter Parish, Antigua and Barbuda|Saint Peter]], [[Saint Philip, Antigua and Barbuda|Saint Philip]], [[Saint Paul Parish, Antigua and Barbuda|Saint Paul]], [[Saint Mary Parish, Antigua and Barbuda|Saint Mary]], and [[Saint John Parish, Antigua and Barbuda|Saint John]].

== Economy ==
{{Main|Economy of Antigua and Barbuda}}
The country's official currency is the [[East Caribbean dollar]]. Given the dominance of tourism, many prices in tourist-oriented businesses are shown in US dollars. The EC dollar is pegged to the US dollar at a varied rate and averages about US$1&nbsp;=&nbsp;EC$2.7.

===Tourism===
Antigua's economy relies largely on tourism, and the island is promoted as a luxury Caribbean escape. Many hotels and resorts are located around the coastline. The island's single airport, [[VC Bird International Airport|VC Bird Airport]], is served by several major airlines, including [[Virgin Atlantic]], [[British Airways]], [[American Airlines]], [[United Airlines]], [[Delta Air Lines]], [[Caribbean Airlines]], [[Air Canada]], [[WestJet]], and [[JetBlue]]. There is regular air service to Barbuda.

===Education===
{{Main|Education in Antigua and Barbuda}}
Antigua has two international primary/secondary schools: CCSET International, which offers the Ontario Secondary School Diploma, and Island Academy, which offers the International Baccalaureate. There are also many other private schools but these institutions tend to follow the same local curriculum (CXCs) as government schools.

The island of Antigua currently has two foreign-owned [[for-profit education|for-profit]] [[offshore medical school]]s, the [[American University of Antigua, College of Medicine|American University of Antigua]] (AUA),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.auamed.org/ |title=American University of Antigua, College of Medicine |access-date=23 August 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070822140939/http://www.auamed.org/ |archive-date=22 August 2007 |url-status=live }}</ref> founded in 2004, and The [[University of Health Sciences Antigua]] (UHSA),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uhsa.ag/ |title=University of Health Sciences Antigua |access-date=23 August 2007}}</ref> founded in 1982. The island's medical schools cater mostly to foreign students but contribute to the local economy and health care.

===Online gambling===
Antigua was one of the first nations to legalize, license, and regulate online gambling and is a primary location for incorporation of [[online gambling]] companies. Some countries, most notably the United States, argue that if a particular gambling transaction is initiated outside the country of Antigua then that transaction is governed by the laws of the country where the transaction was initiated. This argument was brought before [[World Trade Organization|WTO]] and was deemed incorrect.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/dispu_e/cases_e/ds285_e.htm|title=WTO - dispute settlement - the disputes - DS285|website=www.wto.org}}</ref>

In 2006, the United States Congress voted to approve the [[Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006|Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act]] which criminalized the operations of offshore gambling operators which take wagers from American-based gamblers. This was a prima facie violation of the [[General Agreement on Trade in Services|GATS]] treaty obligations enforced by the WTO, resulting in a series of rulings unfavorable to the US.

On 21 December 2007, an Article 22 arbitration panel ruled that the United States' failure to comply with WTO rules would attract a US$21&nbsp;million sanction.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2007/12/21/antigua_us/|title=US TKOs Antigua in bizarre WTO arbitration decision}}</ref>

The WTO ruling was notable in two respects:

First, although technically a victory for Antigua, the $21&nbsp;million was far less than the US$3.5&nbsp;billion which had been sought; one of the three arbitrators was sufficiently bothered by the propriety of this that he issued a [[dissenting opinion]].

Second, a rider to the arbitration ruling affirmed the right of Antigua to take retaliatory steps in view of the prior failure of the US to comply with GATS. These included the rare, but not unprecedented, right to disregard intellectual property obligations to the US.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/22/business/worldbusiness/22gambling.html|title=In Trade Ruling, Antigua Wins a Right to Piracy|first1=James|last1=Kanter|first2=Gary|last2=Rivlin|date=22 December 2007|via=NYTimes.com}}</ref>

Antigua's obligations to the US in respect of patents, copyright, and trademarks are affected. In particular, Berne Convention copyright is in question, and also material not covered by the Berne convention, including [[Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights|TRIPS]] accord obligations to the US. Antigua may thus disregard the [[World Intellectual Property Organization Copyright Treaty|WIPO treaty]] on intellectual property rights, and therefore the US implementation of that treaty (the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]], or DMCA)—at least up to the limit of compensation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.antigua.gov.ag/article_details.php?id=3846&category=38|title=Antigua/Barbuda govt. official statement}}</ref>

Since there is no appeal to the WTO from an Arbitration panel of this kind, it represents the last legal word from the WTO on the matter. Antigua is therefore able to recoup some of the claimed loss of trade by hosting (and taxing) companies whose business model depends on immunity from TRIPS provisions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://torrentfreak.com/antigua-government-set-to-launch-pirate-website-to-punish-united-states-130124/|title=Antigua Government Set to Launch "Pirate" Website To Punish United States - TorrentFreak|date=24 January 2013}}</ref>

== Sport ==
The major Antiguan sport is [[cricket]]. [[Sir Viv Richards|Vivian ("Viv") Richards]] is one of the most famous Antiguans, who played for, and captained, the [[West Indies cricket team]]. Richards scored the fastest Test century at the [[Antigua Recreation Ground]], it was also the venue at which [[Brian Lara]] twice broke the world record for an individual Test innings (375 in 1993/94, 400 not out in 2003/04). Antigua was the location of a [[2007 Cricket World Cup]] site, on a new Recreation Ground constructed on an old cane field in the north of the island. Both football (soccer) and basketball are becoming popular among the island youth. There are several golf courses in Antigua. [[Daniel Bailey]] was the first athlete to win a global world medal at the [[2010 IAAF World Indoor Championships]].

Being surrounded by water, sailing is one of the most popular sports with Antigua Sailing Week and Antigua Classic Yacht Regatta being two of the region's most reputable sailing competitions. Hundreds of yachts from around the world compete around Antigua each year. Sport Fishing is also a very popular sport with several big competitions held yearly. Windsurfing was very popular until kite-surfing came to the island. Kitesurfing or kite-boarding is very popular at Jabbawock Beach.
