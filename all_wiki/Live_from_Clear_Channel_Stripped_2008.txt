'''''Live from Clear Channel Stripped 2008''''' is the second [[live album]] by American singer-songwriter [[Taylor Swift]]. It was released on April 23, 2020, by [[Big Machine Records]], without Swift's authorization. 

The recording was made in 2008 but only released after the masters to her older music had changed hands in a 2019 deal between Big Machine Records and American manager [[Scooter Braun]].<ref name="release" /> Swift denounced ''Live from Clear Channel'' on her [[social media]], calling it a "shameless greed in the [[COVID-19 pandemic|time of coronavirus]]". Earning only 33 units in its first week in the United States, the live album was unsuccessful, and did not enter any [[Billboard charts|''Billboard'' chart]].

==Background and release==
{{Quote|text=This release is not approved by me. It looks to me like [[Scooter Braun]] and his financial backers, 23 Capital, [[Alexander Soros|Alex Soros]] and the [[George Soros|Soros family]] and the [[Carlyle Group]] have seen the latest balance sheets and realised that paying $330 MILLION wasn't exactly a wise choice and they need money. In my opinion … Just another case of shameless greed in the [[COVID-19 pandemic|time of coronavirus]]. So tasteless, but very transparent.|author=Swift on her [[Instagram#Instagram Stories|Instagram story]]|title="Taylor Swift disowns new live album, calling it 'shameless greed'"|source=''[[The Guardian]]''<ref name="guard" />}}

The album was recorded shortly after the beginning Swift's professional career, while she was promoting her sophomore album, ''[[Fearless (Taylor Swift album)|Fearless]]'' (2008). The album was composed of songs from her first two [[Album#Studio|studio albums]] and her second [[Extended play|EP]], ''[[Beautiful Eyes]]'' (2008). It was released on streaming platforms without any prior announcement on April 24, 2020.<ref name="bb" /> According to Swift, the recording was made during a 2008 [[iHeartMedia|Clear Channel]] affiliates' internet-only performance when she was 18 years old. In a social media post, Swift stated that she did not authorize the release,<ref name="mbw" /> calling it "just another case of shameless greed in the time of [[COVID-19 pandemic|coronavirus]]. So tasteless, but very transparent."<ref name="guard" /> Swift's statement also mentioned Braun's financial backers: 23 Capital, [[The Carlyle Group]], and [[Alexander Soros]] and the [[George Soros|Soros family]], the last of which drew allegations from ''[[The Jerusalem Post]]'' that she was "reproducing [[List of conspiracy theories#Antisemitic conspiracy theories|antisemitic conspiracy theories]]" by associating Soros and Braun, who are both [[Jews|Jewish]], with "greed and profiting off the pandemic".<ref name="anti" /> Big Machine Records initially listed the record with a 2017 release date, but it was later adjusted to 2008 to reflect the fact that the recordings were available on Clear Channel websites in 2008.<ref name="usat" />

==Critical reception==
Quinn Moreland from ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]'' wrote that ''Live from Clear Channel'' is predictable, failing to match the standards of Swift's past work, and dubbed it as a "cheap [[bootleg recording|bootleg]]" and "a shameless cash-grab". Moreland commented that the unapproved release looks "eerily similar" to occasions when fake or leaked music appears on [[Music streaming service|streaming services]] without the concerned artists' authorization—releases where "[[scammers]] hold the reins and the real creator never sees a dime".<ref name="pm" />

==Commercial performance==
''Live from Clear Channel Stripped 2008'' sold 33 units in the United States and the [[YouTube]] audio videos of its tracks accumulated 6,000 views combined in its first three days. The meager commercial performance was attributed to Swift's denouncement of the album on her [[social media]];<ref name="sales" /> the album did not enter any [[Billboard charts|''Billboard'' chart]].<ref name="bbchart" />
