After stepping down as a lobbyist for the cable industry, [[Freeport, Illinois]] native [[Robert L. Johnson]] decided to launch his own [[cable television]] network. Johnson would soon acquire a loan for $15,000 and a $500,000 investment from media executive [[John Malone]] to start the network.<ref name="Market Nobody Wanted">{{Cite news|last1=Johnson|first1=Robert|last2=Dumaine|first2=Brian|title=The Market Nobody Wanted|url=https://money.cnn.com/magazines/fsb/fsb_archive/2002/10/01/330571/index.htm|work=Fortune Small Business|date=2002-10-01|accessdate=2008-09-08}}</ref> The network, which was named Black Entertainment Television (BET), launched on January 25, 1980.<ref name="Corporate Fact Sheet">{{cite web |title=Corporate Fact Sheet |url=http://bet.mediaroom.com/index.php?s=45 |publisher=BET Networks |accessdate=2008-09-12 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080912162009/http://bet.mediaroom.com/index.php?s=45 |archivedate=September 12, 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref> [[Cheryl D.

Initially broadcasting for two hours a week as a block of programming on the Madison Square Garden Sports Network (which would change their name to [[USA Network]] three months after BET launched),<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6uQo0R2cUL0C&q=BET+on+USA+Network&pg=PA44|title=The Billion Dollar BET: Robert Johnson and the Inside Story of Black Entertainment Television|last=Pulley|first=Brett|date=2005-10-05|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=9780471735977|language=en}}</ref> the network's lineup composed of [[music videos]] and reruns of popular [[black sitcom]]s.<ref name="Market Nobody Wanted" /> It would not be until 1983 that BET became a full-fledged entity, independent of any other channel or programming block.

BET launched a news program, ''BET News'', in 1988, with [[Ed Gordon (journalist)|Ed Gordon]] as its anchor. Gordon later hosted other programs and specials on BET, such as ''Black Men Speak Out: The Aftermath'', related to the [[1992 Los Angeles riots]], and a recurring interview show, ''Conversations with Ed Gordon''.<ref>{{cite web|last=Johnson|first=Anne Janette|title= Gordon, Ed 1960 – |url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-2871200026.html|work=Contemporary Black Biography|year=1996|accessdate=July 2, 2010}}</ref> In 1996, the talk show ''BET Tonight'' debuted with [[Tavis Smiley]] as host; in 2001, Ed Gordon replaced Smiley as host of the program.

In 1991, the network became the first black-controlled TV company to be listed on the [[New York Stock Exchange]].<ref name="Market Nobody Wanted"/> Starting the late 1990s, the network expanded with the launch of [[digital cable]] networks: what is now the general interest channel [[BET Her]] originally launched as BET on Jazz (later known as BET Jazz and BET J), created originally to showcase jazz music-related programming, especially that of black jazz musicians; in 1998, it entered into a [[joint venture]] with [[Starz (TV channel)|Starz]] (then-owned by John Malone's [[Liberty Media]]) to launch a multiplex service of the [[pay television|premium channel]] featuring African American-oriented movies called BET Movies: Starz! 3 (later renamed Black Starz after BET dropped out of the venture following its purchase by Viacom, then-owner of Starz rival [[Showtime (TV channel)|Showtime]], and now known as Starz InBlack). In 2001, the network lost its status as a black-owned business when it was bought by media conglomerate [[Viacom (original)|Viacom]] for $3&nbsp;billion. In 2005, Johnson retired from the network, turning over his titles of president and chief executive officer to former BET vice president [[Debra L. Lee]].

By 2007, the network had launched two more music-oriented networks, [[BET Hip-Hop]] and [[BET Gospel]]. BET also launched a batch of original programming by this time, including reality shows ''[[Baldwin Hills (TV series)|Baldwin Hills]]'' and ''[[Hell Date]]'', competition show ''[[Sunday Best (American TV series)|Sunday Best]]'', and town hall-style discussion show ''Hip Hop vs. America''.<ref name="confidence">{{cite news|last=Deggans|first=Eric|title=BET diversifies with confidence|url=http://www.sptimes.com/2007/07/24/Tv/BET_diversifies_with_.shtml|accessdate=December 30, 2010|newspaper=St. Petersburg Times|date=July 24, 2007}}</ref> BET's president of entertainment [[Reginald Hudlin]] resigned from the network on September 11, 2008.

In March 2017, president of programming Stephen Hill and executive vice president of original programming Zola Mashariki both stepped down. Connie Orlando, senior vice president of Specials, Music Programming, and News was named the interim president of programming.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://deadline.com/2017/03/bet-programming-shakeup-stephen-hill-zola-mashariki-leaving-1202055014/|title=BET Programming Shakeup: President Stephen Hill & EVP Zola Mashariki Exit|last=Hipes|first=Patrick|date=2017-03-29|work=Deadline|access-date=2017-07-27|language=en-US}}</ref>

In July 2017, Viacom signed new film and television development deals with [[Tyler Perry]] following the expiration of his existing pact with [[Discovery Inc.]] in 2019. As part of this deal, Perry would produce ''[[The Oval (TV series)|The Oval]]'' and ''[[Sistas (TV series)|Sistas]]'' for BET and co-own the network's newly launched streaming service, [[BET+]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://deadline.com/2017/07/tyler-perry-viacom-film-tv-deal-with-viacom-1202128622/|title=Tyler Perry Inks Mega Film & Television Deal With Viacom|last=Andreeva|first=Nellie|date=2017-07-14|work=Deadline|access-date=2018-11-20|language=en-US}}</ref>

==Programming==
{{main|List of programs broadcast by BET}}
BET's programming began with a wide range of comedy, [[news]] and [[current affairs (news format)|current affairs]], [[public affairs (broadcasting)|public affairs]], and music programming, including mainstream [[hip-hop music|rap, hip-hop]] and [[contemporary R&B|R&B]] music videos (which now air on its branded sister networks) and the network's former flagship program, ''[[106 & Park]]'' (which debuted on September 11, 2000 and ended on December 19, 2014). In addition, BET has previously aired same-day or week-delayed late-night runs of syndicated talk shows.

Original programming currently seen on BET include ''[[Boomerang (TV series)|Boomerang]]'', ''[[Games People Play (2019 TV series)|Games People Play]]'' and ''[[The Oval (TV series)|The Oval]]''. Daily programming on the network consists of acquired television series and both theatrically and [[direct-to-video]]-released films. The network's morning ''BET Rejoice'' block (formally ''BET Inspiration'' until 2017) is dedicated to [[Christianity|Christian]] programming and airs in lieu of [[infomercial]]s in late-night, which the network has not aired since 1997;<ref>[http://www.mediapost.com/publications/index.cfm?fa=Articles.showArticle&art_aid=7753 BET Bails On Infomercials]{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, ''MediaPost'', July 1, 2002.</ref> BET is one of a handful of subscription channels and one of only two Viacom-owned networks to have discontinued airing infomercials (sister network [[Nickelodeon]] ran infomercials in some overnight timeslots from 1987 to 1998, with series airing in that daypart since then).

BET also carries and produces several Award telecasts, including the network's own [[BET Awards]], which were established in 2001 to celebrate African Americans and different minorities in music, acting, sports and other parts of entertainment over the past year, and [[The BET Honors]], which were established in 2008 to honor the lives and achievements of African-American luminaries and are presented during [[Black History Month]] each February. The BET Awards is the network's flaghip event, with the "BET Experience" festival held in the days leading up to the telecast.

Many scholars within the African American community maintain that BET perpetuates and justifies racism by affecting the stereotypes held about African Americans, and also by affecting the psyche of its young viewers through its bombardment of negative images of African Americans.<ref>{{cite web|last=Adams |first=Jonathan |title=BET vs. Boondocks |url=http://www.racewire.org/archives/2008/06/bet_vs_boondocks.html |work=Colorlines |date=June 11, 2008 |accessdate=December 30, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100303184327/http://www.racewire.org/archives/2008/06/bet_vs_boondocks.html |archivedate=March 3, 2010 }}</ref>

Following the death of civil rights leader [[Coretta Scott King]] in 2006, BET broadcast its regularly scheduled music video programming, rather than covering King's funeral live, as was done by [[TV One (US TV network)|TV One]] and [[Black Family Channel]], and by cable news channels such as [[CNN]], [[Fox News Channel]], and [[MSNBC]]. The network's website streamed the funeral live, while it periodically broadcast taped, 60-second reports from the funeral by senior news correspondent Andre Showell. Michael Lewellen, BET's senior vice president for corporate communications, defended the decision: "We weighed a number of different options. In the end, we chose to offer a different kind of experience for BET viewers."

In a 2010 interview, BET co-founder [[Sheila Johnson]] said that she herself is "ashamed" of what the network has become. "I don't watch it. I suggest to my kids that they don't watch it," she said. "When we started BET, it was going to be the ''[[Ebony (magazine)|Ebony]]'' magazine on television. We had public affairs programming. We had news... I had a show called ''[[Teen Summit]]'', we had a large variety of programming, but the problem is that then the video revolution started up... And then something started happening, and I didn't like it at all. And I remember during those days we would sit up and watch these videos and decide which ones were going on and which ones were not. We got a lot of backlash from recording artists...and we had to start showing them. I didn't like the way women were being portrayed in these videos."<ref>{{cite web|last=Grove|first=Lloyd|title=Sheila Johnson Slams BET|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2010-04-29/sheila-johnsons-fight-against-hiv-in-dc/|work=The Daily Beast|date=2010-04-29|accessdate=2010-05-22}}</ref>

'''BET Hip-Hop''' is a [[music video]] network owned by [[BET Networks]] which is exclusive to [[digital cable]] systems. It formerly aired some of BET's original programming such as ''[[Rap City (BET program)|Rap City]]'', ''[[ComicView]]'' and the network's video countdown programs. After the 2015 relaunch of the former [[MTV]] Jams as [[BET Jams]] (which has much wider distribution), the channel's programming was shifted to an automated playlist made up of BET's library of older [[hip-hop]] videos. As part of [[Viacom (2005–present)|Viacom]]'s 2017 restructuring plan, the network is speculated to slowly wind down operations over time.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2017/02/viacom-ceo-bob-bakish-supports-paramount-non-core-networks-how-long-1201906682/|title=Viacom CEO Supports Paramount And Non-Core Networks – But For How Long?|last=Lieberman|first=David|website=Deadline Hollywood|date=February 9, 2017|accessdate=September 18, 2017}}</ref>

===Canada===
BET became available in Canada in October 1997 on most pay television providers. The Canadian feed mirrors the American feed, though certain television programs and films are blacked out. Until 2017, they were replaced with repeats of old music video blocks (namely ''BET Music'', ''The Pull Up'' and ''BET Now''). As of May 2018, the feed now airs current music videos and other acquired sitcoms and films in place of blacked-out programs.<ref>[https://www.tvpassport.com/tv-listings/stations/bet-canada/4386 TV Schedule for BET - Canada   TV Passport]</ref>
