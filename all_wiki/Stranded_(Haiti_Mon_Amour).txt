== Background ==
{{Further|2010 Haiti earthquake}}

The 2010 Haiti earthquake was a [[disaster|catastrophic]] [[Moment magnitude scale|magnitude 7.0&nbsp;M<sub>w</sub>]] [[earthquake]], with an [[epicenter]] near the town of [[Léogâne]], approximately {{convert|25|km|mi|abbr=in}} west of [[Port-au-Prince]], [[Haiti]]'s capital. The earthquake occurred at 16:53 local time (21:53 [[UTC]]) on Tuesday, 12 January 2010.<ref name="USGS_Haiti">{{cite web|title=USGS Magnitude 7.0 – HAITI REGION|url=https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/eqinthenews/2010/us2010rja6/|access-date=13 January 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100115110510/http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/eqinthenews/2010/us2010rja6/|archive-date=15 January 2010 <!--DASHBot-->|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name='abc1'>{{cite news|first=Lisa|last=Millar|title=Tens of thousands isolated at quake epicentre|date=17 January 2010|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/01/17/2794190.htm|work=ABC News|access-date=18 January 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100120070235/http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/01/17/2794190.htm|archive-date=20 January 2010 <!--DASHBot-->|url-status=live}}</ref> By 24 January, at least 52 [[aftershock]]s measuring 4.5 or greater had been recorded.<ref name="forbes24012010">{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorkdailytimes.com/news/story/y/75005_as-haiti-mourns-quake-survivor-found-in-rubble.htm|title=As Haiti mourns, quake survivor found in rubble|date=24 January 2010|publisher=New York Daily Times|access-date=1 February 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110427015403/http://www.newyorkdailytimes.com/news/story/y/75005_as-haiti-mourns-quake-survivor-found-in-rubble.htm|archive-date=27 April 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> An estimated three million people were affected by the quake;<ref name="cbsnews1">{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2010/01/13/world/main6090601.shtml?tag=cbsnewsSectionContent.4|title=Red Cross: 3M Haitians Affected by Quake|publisher=CBS News|date=13 January 2010|access-date=13 January 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100120005255/http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2010/01/13/world/main6090601.shtml?tag=cbsnewsSectionContent.4|archive-date=20 January 2010 <!--DASHBot-->|url-status=live}}</ref> the Haitian government reported that an estimated 316,000 people had died,<ref name=deathtoll>[https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/haiti-raises-quake-death-toll-on-anniversary-1.1011363 Haiti raises quake death toll on anniversary] CBC News, 12 January 2011</ref> 300,000 had been injured and 1,000,000 made homeless.<ref>{{cite news|title=Haiti raises earthquake toll to 230,000|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/02/09/AR2010020904447.html|agency=[[Associated Press|AP]]|work=The Washington Post|date=10 February 2010|access-date=30 April 2010}}</ref><ref name="BBCFeb12">{{cite news|title=Haiti will not die, President Rene Preval insists|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8511997.stm|work=BBC News|date=12 February 2010|access-date=12 February 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100213053859/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8511997.stm|archive-date=13 February 2010 <!--DASHBot-->|url-status=live}}</ref> The government of Haiti also estimated that 250,000 [[residential area|residences]] and 30,000 [[commercial building]]s had collapsed or were severely damaged.<ref name=age25>{{cite news|title=Haitians angry over slow aid|author=Clarens Renois|publisher=The Age|date=5 February 2010|url=http://www.theage.com.au/world/haitians-angry-over-slow-aid-20100204-ng2g.html|access-date=5 February 2010|location=Melbourne|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100207005409/http://www.theage.com.au/world/haitians-angry-over-slow-aid-20100204-ng2g.html|archive-date=7 February 2010 <!--DASHBot-->|url-status=live}}</ref> The earthquake caused major damage in Port-au-Prince, [[Jacmel]] and other settlements in the region.

Many countries responded to appeals for [[humanitarian aid]], pledging funds and dispatching rescue and medical teams, engineers and support personnel. Communication systems, air, land, and sea transport facilities, hospitals, and electrical networks had been damaged by the earthquake, which hampered rescue and aid efforts; confusion over who was in charge, air traffic congestion, and problems with prioritisation of flights further complicated early relief work. Port-au-Prince's morgues were overwhelmed with tens of thousands of bodies. These had to be buried in [[mass grave]]s.<ref name="pressassoc21jan">{{cite news|title=Haiti: bilancio del terremoto, 111.499 vittime|date=22 January 2010|publisher=Corriere della Sera|url=http://www.corriere.it/notizie-ultima-ora/Esteri/Haiti-bilancio-terremoto-111-499-vittime/23-01-2010/1-A_000077248.shtml|access-date=23 January 2010}}</ref> As rescues tailed off, supplies, medical care and sanitation became priorities. Delays in aid distribution led to angry appeals from aid workers and survivors, and looting and sporadic violence were observed. On 22 January the [[United Nations]] noted that the emergency phase of the relief operation was drawing to a close, and on the following day the Haitian government officially called off the search for survivors.

== Writing and recording ==
The genesis of the song came with Jay-Z collaborator [[Swizz Beatz]] sending simultaneous [[text message]]s to Jay-Z and Bono.<ref name="rs012110">{{cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/rockdaily/index.php/2010/01/21/inside-the-recording-of-bono-and-jay-zs-haiti-single-stranded/|title=Inside the Recording of Bono and Jay-Z's Haiti Single 'Stranded'|author=Hiatt, Brian|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=2010-01-21}}</ref> They agreed to collaborate on a single, and Bono wrote the hook for "Stranded" while on the phone with Beatz.<ref name="rs012110" /> The latter said, "The idea of the song is 'We're not gonna leave you stranded' and that's what the chorus is. So me and Bono started going back and forth with ideas, and he was like, 'You know this word stranded keeps standing out to me' and I asked him to sing it, and he put me on hold 'cause he's recording the ideas on a [[Dictaphone]] — so he did it there and then on the phone."<ref name="rs012110" />  Bono and The Edge then did further writing work on it together.<ref name="mtv012210" />

The recording was done over diverse geographic locations and melded together, with The Edge helping out with extra [[record producer|production]] work.<ref name="rs012110" />  Beatz then added Rihanna into the effort, later saying, "I knew that Jay would be able to tell a story, and that Bono would be able to sing and bring it home. The last component that I added was Rihanna, and she's kinda like the angel that's on the track, softening it up and giving it that caring feeling, because this hook is so powerful."<ref name="rs012110" />  The final recording was produced by Beatz and Declan Gaffney.<ref name="mtv012210" /><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.u2.com/news/title/stranded-haiti-mon-amour-to-raise-funds-for-haiti-|title='Stranded (Haiti Mon Amour)' raising funds for Haiti|access-date=2010-01-22|publisher=U2.com}}</ref> In the song, Jay-Z narrates the tale, invoking questions of religion and government while urging action and resolve.<ref name="mtv012210" /> Bono and Rihanna sing the vocal hook, with Rihanna taking the lead.<ref name="mtv012210" /><ref name="lat012310" />

== Promotion and release ==
"Stranded (Haiti Mon Amour)" was debuted and first performed live in [[London]] on 22 January 2010, and was shown hours later as part of the [[Hope for Haiti Now: A Global Benefit for Earthquake Relief]] telethon.<ref name="rs012110" /><ref name="bbc-8475971">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/8475971.stm|date=2010-01-22|access-date=2010-01-22|title=Stars line up for Haiti benefit concert|work=[[BBC News]]}}</ref> The performance also featured The Edge on guitar and was one of the more upbeat ones of the event.<ref name="mtv012210">{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1630343/20100122/jay_z.jhtml|title=Jay-Z, U2, Rihanna Team Up For Haiti Telethon|author=Reid, Shaheem|publisher=[[MTV News]]|date=2010-01-22}}</ref>

Also, an album ''[[Hope for Haiti Now (album)|Hope for Haiti Now]]'', including the live performance and the studio version, was released to [[iTunes]] on the same date.<ref name="mtv012210" />

==Critical reception ==
''[[The New York Times]]'' felt that the artists behind "Stranded (Haiti Mon Amour)" deserved credit for creating an original song for the occasion but that the results were of mixed quality: "The sound was muddy, and the concept undercooked, but it was an implicit acknowledgment that a situation this dire demanded something more than squeezing meaning out of a pre-existing song that lacks it."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/01/23/in-song-trying-to-convey-the-scope-of-a-tragedy/|title=In Song, Trying to Convey the Scope of a Tragedy|author=Caramanica, Jon|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=2010-01-23|access-date=2010-01-23}}</ref> [[Ann Powers]] of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' said the song's performance was the most newsworthy of the event, and described its musical flavoring as partly derived from the 1995 [[U2]] side project [[Passengers (side project)|Passengers]] and partly derived from modern rap.<ref name="lat012310">{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nation-and-world/la-fg-haiti-telethon23-2010jan23,0,2144422.story|title=Shining moments in Haiti telethon|author=[[Ann Powers|Powers, Ann]]|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=2010-01-23|access-date=2010-01-23}}</ref> ''[[The Hartford Courant]]'' described it as the most high-powered combination of the telethon, but said that Bono did not seem fully integrated into the performance.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://blogs.courant.com/roger_catlin_tv_eye/2010/01/hope-for-haiti-now.html|title=Hope for Haiti Now|author=Catlin, Roger|newspaper=[[The Hartford Courant]]|date=2010-01-23|access-date=2009-01-23|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120707022834/http://blogs.courant.com/roger_catlin_tv_eye/2010/01/hope-for-haiti-now.html|archive-date=2012-07-07|url-status=dead}}</ref>
