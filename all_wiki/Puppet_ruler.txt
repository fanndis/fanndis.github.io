A '''puppet ruler''' is a person who has a title indicating possession of [[political power]], but who, in reality, is controlled by outside individuals or forces.  Such outside power can be exercised by a foreign government, in which case the puppet ruler's domain is called a [[puppet state]].  But the puppet ruler may also be controlled by internal forces, such as non-elected officials.

== Examples ==
=== In Latin America ===
Governing through puppet presidents has long been a political tactic in [[Latin America]]. Many dictators and strongmen have formally handed over power to other officials for several reasons, often in order to follow constitutional provisions for elections and term limits, to provide a civilian façade for military rule, or to be able to go into semi-retirement away from the capital city. Strongmen who sometimes governed through figureheads included [[Diego Portales]] of [[Chile]], [[Rafael Núñez (politician)|Rafael Núñez]] of [[Colombia]], [[Tomás Guardia Gutiérrez]] of [[Costa Rica]], [[Fulgencio Batista]] of [[Cuba]], [[Ulises Heureaux]] and [[Rafael Trujillo]] of the [[Dominican Republic]], [[Gabriel García Moreno]] of [[Ecuador]], [[Raoul Cédras]] of [[Haiti]], [[Porfirio Díaz]] and [[Plutarco Elías Calles]] of [[Mexico]], the [[Somoza family]] of [[Nicaragua]], [[José Antonio Remón Cantera]], [[Omar Torrijos]] and [[Manuel Noriega]] of [[Panama]], [[Dési Bouterse]] of [[Suriname]], and [[Antonio Guzmán Blanco]] and [[Juan Vicente Gómez]] of [[Venezuela]]. While figureheads who decided to act autonomously were often dismissed, on rare occasions the "puppets" later became significant political figures in their own right. For example, [[Lázaro Cárdenas]] turned against and exiled Calles to the United States and [[Joaquín Balaguer]] was elected to the Dominican presidency six times after the assassination of Trujillo.
