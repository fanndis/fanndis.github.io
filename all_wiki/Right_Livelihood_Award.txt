The '''Right Livelihood Award''' is an international award to "honour and support those offering practical and exemplary answers to the most urgent challenges facing us today."<ref name="MFA"/> The prize was established in 1980 by [[Germans|German]]-Swedish [[philanthropist]] [[Jakob von Uexkull]], and is presented annually in early December.<ref>Jawetz, Pincas.

Although it is promoted as an '''"Alternative Nobel Prize"''',<ref name="BBC-7647718">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7647718.stm |title= Indians win 'alternative Nobel' |date= 2 October 2008 |publisher=BBC |access-date=22 March 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,2144,3683051,00.html |title= Peace and Social Justice Workers Receive Alternative Nobel Prize |date= 1 October 2008 |publisher=[[Deutsche Welle]] |access-date=12 June 2017}}</ref><ref name="TheLocal">{{cite web |url=http://www.thelocal.se/29344/20100930/ |title= Global activists honoured with 'Alternative Nobel' prize |date= 30 September 2010 |work=[[The Local]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101002043224/https://www.thelocal.se/29344/20100930/ |archive-date=2 October 2010|access-date=12 June 2017}}</ref><ref name="BBC-11445709">{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-11445709 |title= Israeli doctors' group wins 'alternative' Nobel prize |date= 30 September 2010 |publisher=BBC |access-date=22 March 2011}}</ref><ref name="FAZ">{{cite news |url=https://www.faz.net/aktuell/wissen/nobelpreise-2009/alternativer-nobelpreis-kampf-gegen-klimawandel-armut-kriege-ausgezeichnet-1709678.html|title= Alternativer Nobelpreis: Kampf gegen Klimawandel, Armut, Kriege ausgezeichnet |date= 13 October 2009 |newspaper=[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]] |access-date=22 March 2011}}</ref> it is not a [[Nobel prize]] (i.e., a prize created by [[Alfred Nobel]]). It does not have any organizational ties at all to the awarding institutions of the Nobel Prize or the Nobel Foundation, unlike the [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]], which is not technically a Nobel prize but is administered by the Nobel Foundation.

However, the Right Livelihood Award is sometimes popularly associated with the Nobel prizes. The Right Livelihood Award committee arranged for awards to be made in the [[Riksdag building|Riksdag of Sweden]] the day before the Nobel prizes and the economics prize are also awarded in [[Stockholm]]. However, the Right Livelihood Awards are understood as a critique of the traditional Nobel prizes.<ref name="FAZ"/> The establishment of the award followed a failed attempt to have the Nobel Foundation create new prizes in the areas of environmental protection, sustainable development and human rights. The prize has been awarded to a diverse group of people and organisations, including [[Wangari Maathai]], [[Astrid Lindgren]], [[Bianca Jagger]], [[Mordechai Vanunu]], [[Leopold Kohr]], [[Arna Mer-Khamis]], [[Felicia Langer]], [[Petra Kelly]], [[Survival International]], [[Amy Goodman]], [[Catherine Hamlin]], [[Memorial (society)|Memorial]], [[Edward Snowden]], [[Daniel Ellsberg]], and [[Greta Thunberg]].

==Ceremony==
Since 1985, the ceremony has taken place in [[Stockholm]]'s old Parliament building, in the days before the traditional Nobel prizes are awarded in the same city. A group of Swedish Parliamentarians from different parties host the ceremony; in 2009 European Commissioner [[Margot Wallström]] co-hosted the ceremony. However, in 2014 when it became public that one of the recipients of the 2014 prize was [[whistleblower]] [[Edward Snowden]], the ceremonial group was disinvited from the Ministry for Foreign Affairs building in Stockholm.<ref>{{cite news|title=Edward Snowden inte välkommen till UD|url=http://www.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/article19588815.ab|access-date=24 September 2014|work=Aftonbladet|publisher=Aftonbladet|date=24 September 2014|ref=16}}</ref>

In 2019, marking the 40th anniversary of the foundation of the Award, the ceremony was held at [[Cirkus (Stockholm)|Cirkus]] before a live audience of more than 1,200 people. World-renowned artists such as [[José González (singer)|José González]] and [[Ane Brun]] were among the night's performers.<ref>{{Citation|title=2019 Right Livelihood Award Presentation|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Su3koxFOw|language=en|access-date=2020-01-08}}</ref>

==Nature of the award==
Some media refer to the prize as the ''Alternative Nobel Prize'',<ref name=Thorpe>{{cite book|last1=Thorpe|first1=Edgar|last2=Thorpe|first2=Showick|title=Guide to the Combined Defence Services Exam|publisher=Pearson Education|location=New Delhi|isbn=81-317-0074-7|page=26|chapter=General Awareness: Right Livelihood Award}}</ref> and the prize is frequently understood as a critique of the traditional Nobel prizes.<ref name="FAZ"/>

The prize differs significantly from the [[Nobel Prize]]s:
*it is not a fulfillment of [[Alfred Nobel]]'s bequest and thus not one of Nobel's own prizes;
*it has an open nomination process (anyone can nominate anyone else, except close relatives or their own organizations);<ref>[http://www.rightlivelihood.org/propose_a_candidate.html Right Livelihood Award: Proposals & Selection Process]. Accessed January 24, 2010.</ref>
*it is not limited to specific categories;<ref name=about/>
*the prize money is considerably lower than that of the Nobel Prize. Currently it is €200,000 compared to about €1,000,000 for a Nobel Prize;
*the funds for the prizes now come from donations<ref name="MFA">{{cite web |url=http://www.government.se/sb/d/17191/a/225032 |title=The 2013 Right Livelihood Laureates announced |author=Ministry for Foreign Affairs |date=26 September 2013 |access-date=2014-08-14 |publisher=Government Offices of Sweden |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140303235727/http://www.government.se/sb/d/17191/a/225032 |archive-date=3 March 2014 }}</ref> while the Nobel Prizes come from the revenue of Alfred Nobel's fortune. The [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]] (which is technically not a Nobel Prize) is financed by the [[Sveriges Riksbank]].

==History==
[[File:Rightlivelihoodaward.jpg|thumb|right|150 px|The 1994 award given to [[Hanumappa Sudarshan|Dr. Sudarshan]] photographed in [[BR Hills]]]]
[[Carl Wolmar Jakob von Uexküll|Jakob von&nbsp;Uexküll]], a philanthropist, sold his stamp collection worth one million US&nbsp;dollars, which provided the initial funding for the award. Before establishing the award in 1980, von&nbsp;Uexkull had tried to persuade the [[Nobel Foundation]] to establish new prizes to be awarded together with the Nobel Prizes. He suggested new prize categories to be created: one in ecology and one in development.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://rightlivelihood.org/history.html |title=Right Livelihood Award: History - Setting up the 'Alternative Nobel Prize' |publisher=Rightlivelihood.org |access-date=2012-07-28 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120829121254/http://www.rightlivelihood.org/history.html |archive-date=2012-08-29 }}</ref> Like the [[Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel|Nobel Economics Prize]], this would have been possible with an amendment to the Nobel Foundation statutes and funding of the prize amount completely separate from Nobel's fortune. The Nobel Prize amount was 880,000 Swedish kronor at that time,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/about/amounts.html |title=The Nobel Prize Amounts |publisher=Nobelprize.org |access-date=2012-07-28}}</ref> which corresponded to 195,000 US&nbsp;dollars.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://currate.com/historical-exchange-rates.php|title=according to historical exchange rate from}}</ref> However, as a result of the debate that followed the establishment of the [[Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel]] (first awarded in 1969), the Nobel Foundation had decided not to associate the Nobel Prize with any additional awards, so von&nbsp;Uexküll's proposal was rejected.<ref name="ttdn">TT-DN (2003-10-02).

From 1980–2019, the foundation presented awards to 178 Laureates from 70 countries.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rightlivelihoodaward.org/honour/about-the-right-livelihood-award/|title=About the Right Livelihood Award|website=The Right Livelihood Award|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-08}}</ref> Its self-described purpose is to bestow prizes and thus publicize the work of recipients' local solutions to worldwide problems.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rightlivelihood.org/history.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100620110022/http://rightlivelihood.org/history.html|url-status=dead|title=Right Livelihood Award history|archive-date=June 20, 2010}}</ref>
