'''Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender''' ('''[[LGBT]]''') '''rights''' are widely diverse in '''[[Europe]]''' per country. Sixteen out of the 28 countries that have legalised [[same-sex marriage]] worldwide are situated in Europe. A further thirteen European countries have legalised [[civil union]]s or other forms of more limited recognition for [[Same-sex relationship|same-sex couples]].

Several European countries do not recognise any form of same-sex unions. Marriage is defined as a union solely between a man and a woman in the constitutions of [[Armenia]], [[Belarus]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Croatia]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Hungary]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], [[Moldova]], [[Montenegro]], [[Poland]], [[Russia]], [[Serbia]], [[Slovakia]] and [[Ukraine]]. Of these, however, Armenia recognises same-sex marriages performed abroad,<ref name="armenia">{{Cite web|url=http://www.panarmenian.net/m/eng/news/243348|title=PanARMENIAN.Net - Mobile|website=www.panarmenian.net}}</ref> and Croatia, Hungary and Montenegro recognise same-sex partnerships. Eastern Europe is seen as having fewer legal rights and protections, worse living conditions, and less supportive public opinion for LGBT people than that in Western Europe.

All European countries that allow marriage also allow joint adoption by same-sex couples, as does Andorra. Of the countries that have civil unions, none but Andorra allow joint adoption, and only half allow step-parent adoption.

The top three European countries in terms of LGBT equality according to [[ILGA-Europe]] are [[LGBT rights in Malta|Malta]], [[LGBT rights in Belgium|Belgium]] and [[LGBT rights in Luxembourg|Luxembourg]].<ref name="MaltaToday.com.mt">{{cite web|url=http://www.maltatoday.com.mt/news/national/57877/malta_ranked_first_in_european_rainbow_map_of_lgbtiq_rights|title=Malta ranks first in European 'rainbow map' of LGBTIQ rights|work=MaltaToday.com.mt}}</ref><ref name="Country Ranking">{{cite web|url=http://www.rainbow-europe.org/country-ranking|title=Country Ranking|website=Rainbow-europe.org|accessdate=2 October 2017}}</ref> Western Europe is often regarded as being one of the most progressive regions in the world for LGBT people to live in.

Although same-sex relationships were quite common [[Homosexuality in ancient Greece|in ancient Greece]], [[Homosexuality in ancient Rome|Rome]] and [[pagan]] [[Celts|Celtic]] societies, after Christianity became the official religion of the [[Roman Empire]], severe laws against homosexual behaviour appeared. An edict by the [[Roman emperor|Emperor]] [[Theodosius I]] in 390 condemned all "passive" homosexual men to death by public burning. This was followed by the ''[[Corpus Juris Civilis]]'' of [[Justinian I]] in 529, which prescribed public [[castration]] and execution for all who committed homosexual acts, both active and passive partners. Homosexual behaviour, called [[sodomy]], was considered a capital crime in most European countries, and thousands of homosexual men were executed across Europe during waves of [[Violence against LGBT people|persecution]] in these centuries. Lesbians were less often singled out for punishment, but they also suffered persecution and execution from time to time.<ref>Crompton, Louis. (2003). ''Homosexuality & Civilization.'' Cambridge: The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press. pp. 1-212.</ref>

Since the foundation of [[Poland]] in 966, [[Law of Poland|Polish law]] has never defined homosexuality as a crime.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.hu-berlin.de/sexology/IES/poland.html%20%20 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-07-20 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100729165231/http://www2.hu-berlin.de/sexology/IES/poland.html |archivedate=29 July 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.hu-berlin.de/sexology/IES/poland.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-10-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511015953/http://www2.hu-berlin.de/sexology/IES/poland.html |archivedate=11 May 2013 }}</ref> Forty years after Poland [[Partitions of Poland|lost its independence]] in 1795, the sodomy laws of [[Imperial Russia|Russia]], [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]], and [[Austrian Empire|Austria]] came into force in the partitioned Polish territory.

During the [[French Revolution]], the [[National Assembly (French Revolution)|French National Assembly]] rewrote the criminal code in 1791, omitting all reference to homosexuality. During the [[Napoleonic wars]], homosexuality was decriminalised in territories coming under French control, such as the [[Netherlands]] and many of the pre-unification German states; however, in Germany this ended with [[Unification of Germany|the unification of the country under the Prussian Kaiser]], as [[Prussia]] had long punished homosexuality harshly. On 6 August 1942, the [[Vichy government]] made homosexual relations with anyone under twenty-one illegal as part of its conservative agenda. Most Vichy legislation was repealed after the war—but the anti-gay Vichy law remained on the books for four decades until it was finally repealed in August 1982 when the age of consent (15) was again made the same for heterosexual as well as homosexual partners.

Nevertheless, gay men and lesbians continued to live [[The closet|closeted]] lives, since [[Societal attitudes towards homosexuality|moral and social disapproval]] by heterosexual society remained strong across Europe for another two decades, until the modern [[LGBT social movements|gay rights]] [[Gay liberation|movement]] began in 1969. {{Further|LGBT social movements}}

Various countries under [[dictatorship]]s in the 20th century were very anti-homosexual, such as in [[the Soviet Union]], in [[Nazi Germany]] and in [[LGBT rights in Spain|Spain]] under [[Francisco Franco]]'s regime. In contrast, after [[LGBT rights in Poland|Poland]] regained independence after [[World War I]], it went on in 1932 to become the second country in 20th-century Europe to decriminalise homosexual activity (after the [[Soviet Union]], which had decriminalized it in 1917 under the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]], but re-criminalized it in 1933 under [[Stalin]]), followed by [[LGBT rights in Denmark|Denmark]] in 1933, [[LGBT rights in Iceland|Iceland]] in 1940, [[LGBT rights in Switzerland|Switzerland]] in 1942 and [[LGBT rights in Sweden|Sweden]] in 1944.

In 1956, the [[East Germany|German Democratic Republic]] abolished [[paragraph 175]] of the German penal code which outlawed homosexuality.<ref>Green, J. and De La Motte, B. (2015) "Stasi State or Socialist Paradise?: The German Democratic Republic and What Became of It." p.74</ref>
In 1962, homosexual behaviour was decriminalised in [[Czechoslovakia]], following a scientific research of [[Kurt Freund]] that included [[Penile plethysmograph|phallometry]] of gay men who appeared to have given up sexual relations with other men and established heterosexual marriages. Freund came to the conclusion that homosexual orientation may not be changed. The claim that phallometry on men was the reason for decriminalization of homosexual behavior in Czechoslovakia is contradicted by the fact that it applied to women as well, as the notion of a male-specific fixity of sexual orientation as an argument for gay rights combined with the notion of female sexual plasticity is adverse to lesbian rights.<ref>Gay and Lesbian Rights: A Reference Handbook, 2nd Edition, David E Newton</ref><ref>Before Stonewall: Activists for Gay and Lesbian Rights in Historical Context, Vern L. Bullough 2002</ref>

In 1972, Sweden became the first country in the world to allow people who were transgender by legislation to surgically change their sex and provide free hormone replacement therapy.<ref name=RFSU>{{cite web |author=Hanna Jedvik|url=http://www.rfsu.se/lagen_om_konsbyte_ska_utredas.asp |title=Lagen om könsbyte ska utredas|publisher=RFSU |accessdate=24 June 2007 |date=5 March 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071012000954/http://www.rfsu.se/lagen_om_konsbyte_ska_utredas.asp <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 12 October 2007}}</ref>

In 1979, a number of people in Sweden called in sick with a case of ''being homosexual,'' in protest of homosexuality being classified as an illness. This was followed by an activist occupation of the main office of the ''[[National Board of Health and Welfare (Sweden)|National Board of Health and Welfare]]''. Within a few months, Sweden became the first country in Europe from those that had previously defined homosexuality as an illness to remove it as such.<ref>[http://www.quistbergh.se/view/514 Jag känner mig lite homosexuell idag | quistbergh.se]

The American Psychiatric Association removed homosexuality from its list of mental disorders in 1973 with publication of its DSM II.  Source: The American Psychiatric Association, and DSM II.   Thus, the American Psychiatric Association took this step six years before a similar action was taken in Sweden.</ref>

In 1989, [[Same-sex marriage in Denmark|Denmark]] was the first country in Europe, and the world, to introduce [[registered partnership]]s for same-sex couples.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://danmarkshistorien.dk/leksikon-og-kilder/vis/materiale/lov-om-registreret-partnerskab-7-juni-1989/|title=Vis|last=103982@au.dk|date=2018-04-13|website=danmarkshistorien.dk|language=da|access-date=2018-06-02}}</ref>

== Recent developments ==
[[Civil union|Civil partnerships]] have been legal in the [[same-sex marriage in the Republic of Ireland|Republic of Ireland]] since 2011. In 2013, the government held a [[Constitutional Convention (Ireland)|constitutional convention]] which voted overwhelmingly in favour of amending the constitution in order to extend marriage rights to same-sex couples.

On 15 July 2014, [[Sabor|Croatian Parliament]] passed the Life Partnership Act giving same-sex couples all rights that married couples have, except for adoption.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tportal.hr/vijesti/342766/Povijesna-odluka-Hrvatska-ima-Zakon-o-zivotnom-partnerstvu.html|title=Povijesna odluka: Hrvatska ima Zakon o životnom partnerstvu|work=tportal.hr|accessdate=29 June 2015}}</ref> However, the Act allows a parent's life partner to become the child's partner-guardian. Partner-guardianship as an institution is equal to step-child adoption in rights and responsibilities, but it does not give parental status to the parent's life partner. Criteria for partner-guardianship and step-parent adoption for opposite-sex couples are the same. Also, regardless of partner-guardianship, a parent's life partner may attain partial parental responsibility over the child either via court or consensus among the parents and life partner, even full in some cases when the court decides that it is in the child's best interest.

In September 2014, a law went into effect in [[LGBT rights in Denmark|Denmark]] effectively dropping the former practice of requiring [[transgender]] persons to undergo arduous psychiatric evaluation and castration before being allowed legal gender change.
