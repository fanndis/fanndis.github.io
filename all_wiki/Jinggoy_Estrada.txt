'''Jose Pimentel Ejercito Jr.''' (born February 17, 1963), better known as '''Jinggoy Estrada''' ({{IPA-tl|dʒɪŋˈɡoɪ ɛsˈtɾada|lang}}), is a Filipino politician, actor & film producer. He is the son of former [[Philippines|Philippine]] [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Joseph Estrada]]. Before serving two terms as a [[Senate of the Philippines|Senator of the Philippines]] from 2004 to 2016, he served as [[San Juan, Metro Manila|Vice Mayor of San Juan]] in 1988. After one term, he was immediately elected as the town's [[San Juan, Metro Manila|mayor]] in 1992 and served until 2001. He became acting [[Senate of the Philippines|Senate President of the Philippines]] in 2013. 

In 2014, he was indicted and charged for allegedly "stealing" ₱183 million from his discretionary funds in a scandal known as the [[Priority Development Assistance Fund scam]].<ref name=":2" /> He was jailed until 2016 and was acquitted after posting bail while trial is still ongoing for the multiple charges against him, he still sought reelection to the Senate in the [[2019 Philippine general election|2019 general election]], but he lost placing 15th overall.

Beyond politics, Estrada also participated in acting; he notably won the "Best Actor Award" in the [[2007 Metro Manila Film Festival]] for the film ''Katas ng Saudi''.

==Early life and education==
Estrada was born on February 17, 1963. He finished his primary and secondary education at the [[Ateneo de Manila University]] and earned a degree in A.B. Economics from the [[University of the Philippines Manila]]. He took up Bachelor of Laws for four years at the [[Lyceum of the Philippines University]] while serving as Vice Mayor of the then Municipality of [[San Juan, Metro Manila|San Juan]] at the age of 25. He was also bestowed an honorary Doctorate in Humanities in 2007 by the [[Laguna State Polytechnic University]].

==Political career==
=== Mayor of San Juan City (1992 - 2001) ===
In 1992, he became the youngest ever elected-local chief executive in the entire nation at age 29. For three (3) consecutive terms, he administered the economic, social, political, and cultural affairs of the Municipality of San Juan beyond everyone's expectations. He spearheaded various projects and programs for the improvement of the said municipality in the form of - construction of modernized Barangay Halls with Day Care Centers in all Barangays, repair and renovation of the now San Juan National High School, and other public elementary schools, recreation centers like gymnasiums, basketball courts and play grounds and the creation of different livelihood centers, improvement and replacement of drainages, concreting of municipal roads and the construction of a four-storey San Juan Medical Center and the San Juan Municipal Gymnasium. During his incumbency, San Juan gained the reputation of being one of the most progressive municipalities and the Most Peaceful Municipality in the Philippines.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.senate.gov.ph/senators/sen_bio/jestrada_bio.asp |title=Archived copy |access-date=2019-01-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190114122153/http://www.senate.gov.ph/senators/sen_bio/jestrada_bio.asp |archive-date=2019-01-14 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

During his final tenure as Mayor, he was sworn into office as the National President of the [[League of Municipalities of the Philippines]] (LMP) from 1998 to 2001.

=== Senator (2004 - 2016) ===
In 2004, he was elected as senator. During his first term, he introduced at least 617 bills and resolutions and steered the passage of at least 16 bills either as principal sponsor or principal author. Jinggoy is hailed as the second most productive and prolific senator, next to Sen. Miriam Defensor-Santiago, who filed the most number of bills and resolutions in the Senate.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2013/12/22/1270935/miriam-has-most-number-bills-resolutions|title=Miriam has most number of bills, resolutions|website=Philstar.com|accessdate=30 August 2019}}</ref>

On July 23, 2007, Estrada was elected as [[President pro tempore of the Senate of the Philippines|Senate president pro tempore]].

On August 15, 2007, the [[Supreme Court of the Philippines|Supreme Court]] voted 13-0 to uphold the Sandiganbayan's decision to grant his bail in connection with his plunder case before the graft court.  His father, former president Joseph "Erap" Estrada was the main accused in that plunder case, and was subsequently convicted.  However, Erap was immediately pardoned by then Pres. Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/56118/news/nation/update-sc-upholds-bail-for-jinggoy/|title=(Update) SC upholds bail for Jinggoy|website=GMA News Online|accessdate=30 August 2019}}</ref> On September 11, 2007 Estrada introduced Senate bill 1556, proposing to make ROTC mandatory for all college students.

Jinggoy was acquitted in the plunder charge.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/60117/news/nation/erap-guilty-of-plunder-sentenced-to-reclusion-perpetua/|title=Erap guilty of plunder, sentenced to reclusion perpetua|website=GMA News Online|accessdate=30 August 2019}}</ref>

In 2010, he was reelected as senator, finishing in the 2nd place. During the opening of the [[15th Congress of the Philippines|15th Congress]] on July 26, 2010, he was reelected as Senate president pro tempore.

During his stint in the Senate, he had been consistently hailed as one of the very few senators who scored perfect attendance, with no absence or late during the chamber's plenary sessions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2006/06/24/343593/jinggoy-scores-perfect-attendance|title=Jinggoy scores perfect attendance|website=Philstar.com|accessdate=30 August 2019}}</ref>

===Batas Kasambahay===
Estrada is the principal author of the Kasambahay Law, or the law promoting the interests and welfare of the domestic workers in the Philippines. Republic Act 10361, or simply the "Kasambahay Law", prescribed standards, privileges and rights of the domestic workers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sunstar.com.ph//article/25655/|title=Dole urged to step implementation of Kasambahay Law|first=Ruth Abbey|last=Gita|date=August 14, 2015|website=Sunstar.com.ph|accessdate=30 August 2019}}</ref>

===Hong Kong Airport incident===
In August 2010, Estrada claimed that while traveling to [[Hong Kong]], he experienced a backlash of the emotions surrounding the death of 8 Chinese nationals from Hong Kong during the 2010 [[Manila hostage crisis]]. According to him, as he passed through the immigration desk in Hong Kong, officers threw back his passport at him after checking it.<ref name="hk"/>

Estrada said the officer may not have known who he was because he used a "regular passport" for personal travel. He also said that he "understood the pain being felt by many Hong Kong nationals".<ref name="hk">[http://www.mb.com.ph/articles/274512/jinggoy-kris-put-with-hong-kong-rage Jinggoy, Kris put up with Hong Kong rage] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100831033823/http://www.mb.com.ph/articles/274512/jinggoy-kris-put-with-hong-kong-rage |date=2010-08-31 }}, August 28, 2010</ref>

According to ''[[Apple Daily]]'', the Hong Kong immigration department recorded that Estrada visited Hong Kong with a diplomat passport, and that from an alleged video surveillance record, he and three other Filipinos were accompanied by staff from the Philippine embassy and had arranged to go through the privileged passage for diplomats. The immigration officer handed back the passport to the Philippines embassy staff, not to Estrada.<ref>[http://hkm.appledaily.com/Home/ShowArticleFromActionNews/a3e7587f-2734-4ee7-b051-c93784279df8 Son of Former President lied about having his passport thrown by officers in Hong Kong], Apple Daily, 29 August 2010 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100908100948/http://hkm.appledaily.com/Home/ShowArticleFromActionNews/a3e7587f-2734-4ee7-b051-c93784279df8 |date=September 8, 2010 }}</ref>

==Personal life==
In 1989, Estrada married Ma. Presentacion "Precy" Vitug with whom he has four children, namely, [[Janella Ejercito Estrada|Janella Marie]], Joseph Luis Manuel, [[Julian Estrada|Julian Emilio]] and Julienne.

On May 3, 2020, the former senator was arrested over alleged violations of the COVID-19 community quarantine rules. He said that he had been distributing relief goods to residents of the city when policemen in two patrol cars arrived at the scene and invited him to the local precinct.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cnnphilippines.com/news/2020/5/3/Jinggoy-Estrada-brought-to-police-station-quarantine-violations-San-Juan.html|title=Ex-senator Jinggoy Estrada brought to police station over alleged quarantine violations|publisher=CNN Philippines|accessdate=May 4, 2020}}</ref>
