'''''Hodgson v. Minnesota''''', 497 U.S. 417 (1990), was a [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] [[abortion]] rights case that dealt with whether a [[State law (United States)|state law]] may require notification of both parents before a minor can obtain an abortion. The law in question provided a judicial alternative.

==Background==
The case concerned a Minnesota law. The law required notice to both parents of a minor before she could undergo an abortion; it also contained a judicial bypass provision designed to take effect only if a court found one to be necessary.<ref name=Greenhouse>{{citation | author = Greenhouse, Linda | authorlink = Linda Greenhouse | title = Becoming Justice Blackmun | publisher = Times Books | year = 2005 | pages = 196–197}}</ref> [[Jane Elizabeth Hodgson|Dr. Jane Hodgson]], a Minneapolis gynecologist, challenged the law. The Eighth Circuit had ruled that the law would be unconstitutional without a judicial bypass, but that the bypass provision saved it.<ref name=Greenhouse/>

==Opinion of the Court==
While [[John Paul Stevens|Justice Stevens]] delivered a majority opinion for one of the holdings, there were five votes for each of two holdings, with [[Sandra Day O'Connor|Justice O'Connor]] proving as the decisive vote for each.<ref name=Greenhouse/> Justices Stevens, Brennan, Marshall, Blackmun and O'Connor formed a majority holding that the two-parent notice requirement by itself was unconstitutional.<ref name=Greenhouse/> Justice O'Connor believed that the two-parent requirement entailed risk to a pregnant teenager; she also argued that the rule failed to meet even the lowest standard of judicial review, a rationality standard.<ref name=Greenhouse/> She joined the Court's more conservative Justices (Chief Justice Rehnquist and Justices White, Scalia and Kennedy), to form a majority for the law being valid with the judicial bypass; [[Justice Kennedy]] had pointed out the usefulness of the bypass procedure, as judges granted all but a handful of requests to authorize abortions without parental notice.<ref name=Greenhouse/>

The ruling struck down the two-parent notification requirement, the majority citing an APA brief asserting that one-parent families are common in that state and that within the state, a minor often only needs one parent's permission for certain health needs; the rest of the statute, though, was voted constitutional because of its allowance for judicial bypass.

This case involved the first restriction on abortion that Justice O'Connor voted to strike down.<ref name=Greenhouse/>
