"'''Stay'''" is a song recorded by Barbadian singer [[Rihanna]] for her seventh studio album, ''[[Unapologetic]]'' (2012). It features guest vocals by [[Mikky Ekko]], and was released as the second single from the album on January 7, 2013. "Stay" was co-written by Ekko and [[Justin Parker]]. The song's lyrical content speaks of temptation and the inability to resist true love. [[Music journalism|Music critics]] were generally positive in their opinion regarding the balladry, with most describing it as a standout track on the album.

Upon the release of ''Unapologetic'', "Stay" charted on multiple charts worldwide. Following its release as a single, it reached number one in Bulgaria, Canada, the Czech Republic, Denmark and Israel and the top five in twenty-four countries worldwide including Australia, France, Germany, New Zealand, Norway, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. It peaked at number three on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], becoming Rihanna's twenty-fourth top ten on the chart, thus surpassing [[Whitney Houston]]'s tally. Furthermore, it has charted at number one on the US [[Mainstream Top 40 (Pop Songs)|Pop Songs]] chart and 16 on the [[Hot Dance Club Songs]] chart. Worldwide the single has sold over 10<ref>http://instagram.com/p/w7YCTgKAq8/?modal=true</ref> million copies making it one of the [[List of best-selling singles|best selling singles]] of all time.

The song's accompanying music video, directed by [[Sophie Muller]], depicts Rihanna naked in a bathtub filled with cloudy water, while Ekko sings in a separate bathroom. Critics likened the vulnerability and raw emotion in the video to the song itself. Rihanna premiered "Stay" on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' in the United States, while she performed the song in the United Kingdom on the [[The X Factor (UK series 9)|ninth series]] of ''[[The X Factor (UK)|The X Factor]]''. Rihanna and Ekko also performed "Stay" at the [[2013 Grammy Awards]]. The track was included on the [[set list]] of the majority of her 777 Tour promotional tour dates, in support of the album, while it was included on Rihanna's fifth headlining tour, the "[[Diamonds World Tour]]" in the encore and the opening song of her seventh headlining tour, the "[[Anti World Tour]]".

==Music video==
===Background===
The music video for "Stay" was directed by [[Sophie Muller]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.videostatic.com/vs/2013/02/in-production-rihanna-sophie-muller-dir.html|title=IN PRODUCTION: Rihanna – Sophie Muller, dir.|publisher=Video Static|accessdate=February 4, 2013}}</ref> On February 10, 2013, whilst walking the red carpet of the [[55th Annual Grammy Awards]], Rihanna held an interview with [[Ryan Seacrest]] who officially revealed that the music video would premiere on [[E! News]] the following day. Rihanna described the production saying, "The video was really, really simple. I pretty much stayed put in a bathtub, and we shot it really tight, really close. There's Mikky Ekko in the video as well. This is the first time I've ever collaborated with him, so I'm excited about that because he's actually the one who wrote the song and I kinda just fell in love with it so much and in love with the tone of his voice and we wanna keep him a part of it, so you'll see him in the video." The singer added, "It's a very emotional song and it's personal, so you just think about, it's almost like telling a story, and when you tell a story, even to yourself – if you're saying it out loud and expressing how you feel – it needs to be powerful because it needs to be authentic."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://uk.eonline.com/news/386762/rihanna-s-new-music-video-stay-to-premiere-exclusively-on-e-news|title=Rihanna's New Music Video "Stay" to Premiere Exclusively on E!

===Synopsis===
The video opens with a shot of running water. Rihanna is then presented undressing and climbing into a bathtub. Throughout the rest of the video, the singer is presented nude in the tub full of cloudy green water; subtle camera angles protect her modesty. Rihanna is shown wearing little make-up and with long hair tangled and wet over one side of her face. The singer flickers her eyes to the ceiling and puts her head in her hands, showing off long manicured nails and a diamond stud earring. The low-key video also features [[Mikky Ekko]], who performs his parts of the song separately including scenes of him perched on the edge of a different bathtub, gazing into a mirror, in front of an unlit fireplace, and sitting on a grand chair.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://au.eonline.com/news/386762/rihanna-s-new-music-video-stay-to-premiere-exclusively-on-e-news|title=Rihanna's New Music Video "Stay" to Premiere Exclusively on E!

===Reception===
A reviewer of The Huffington Post commented, "The heartfelt ballad, from her latest album ''Unapologetic'', is full of emotion – and the video matches that, as a stripped-down Rihanna soaks in a tub."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2013/02/12/rihanna-stay-video-_n_2667174.html|title=Rihanna's 'Stay' Video: Stripped-Down Singer Takes A Soak|publisher=The Huffington Post. Arianna Huffington|accessdate=February 12, 2013}}</ref> August Brown of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' commented on the video saying, "we kind of want to curl up in a hot shower and have a good cry ourselves." They continued saying, "It's kind of an echo of her famous "[[We Found Love]]" [[We Found Love (music video)|video]], with that clip's quick-cut, drugged-up frenzy of bad romance replaced with solitary, locked-off shots that feel more intimate than exploitative. She looks amazing, but the focus isn't so much her body as the look of constant devastation on her face." Brown summarised the clip as being "appropriately minimalist[ic]" and concluded calling it "a beautiful video that broaden's Rihanna's emotional-musical palette."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/music/posts/la-et-ms-rihanna-releases-gloomy-stay-video-20130212,0,2792151.story |title= Rihanna releases gloomy 'Stay' video|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=February 12, 2013|first=August|last=Brown|date=February 12, 2013}}</ref> Bené Viera of [[VH1]] commented on the video saying, "Usually the tough girl posturing is a cover up for a very sensitive soul.

Janet Jackson and Britney Spears also bared their emotion immersed in water. [[Janet Jackson|Janet]] bared all in a blue lagoon for her 'Every Time' video. A little less glam, Britney's tub scene in her 'Everytime' video proved dark foreshadowing into her troubled world."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://styleblazer.com/128148/video-premiere-rihanna-gets-serious-in-stay-plus-two-other-famous-bathtub-videos/|title=Video Premiere: Rihanna Gets Serious In "Stay" (Plus Two Other Famous Bathtub Videos)|publisher=Style Blazer|date=February 12, 2013|accessdate=July 13, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107004426/http://styleblazer.com/128148/video-premiere-rihanna-gets-serious-in-stay-plus-two-other-famous-bathtub-videos/|archive-date=November 7, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>
