'''Polaroid''' was an American company best known for its [[instant film]] and cameras. The company was founded in 1937 by [[Edwin H.

The original Polaroid Corporation was founded in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], by Edwin Land and George W. Wheelwright III in 1937.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Rael|first=Trula J.|date=November 9, 2017|title="Just One of the Boys": Edwin Land and The Polaroid Corporation|work=The Harvard Crimson|url=https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2017/11/9/edwin-land-and-the-polaroid-corporation/|url-status=live|access-date=2020-08-13}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|last=Deutsch|first=Claudia H.|date=2001-03-03|title=G.

Land, having completed his freshman year at [[Harvard University]], left to pursue this market, resulting in Polaroid's birth. Land later returned to Harvard to continue his research.{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}} Polaroid, owning patents to its polarizer technology, got its start by employing polarization in products that included 3-D movies and glare-reducing goggles for dogs. During World War II, Polaroid designed and manufactured numerous products for the armed services including an infrared night viewing device. He led the company as CEO for 43 years. He headed the Polaroid Corporation, developing it from a small research and marketing firm into a well known high-tech company. [[Kodak]] was a customer for some of Land's polarizing products. Recognized by most as the father of instant photography, he included all the operations of a darkroom inside the film itself. Land was pictured on the cover of ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine in 1972 with the inscription, "A Genius and His Magic Camera".

In the 1940s, Polaroid purchased the [[B B Chemical Company]] building at 784 [[Memorial Drive (Cambridge)|Memorial Drive]] in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]] for its headquarters. The landmark<ref name=MACRIS>{{cite web|url=http://mhc-macris.net/Details.aspx?MhcId=CAM.257|title=MACRIS inventory record and NRHP nomination for B & B Chemical Company|publisher=Commonwealth of Massachusetts Historical Commission |accessdate=2019-09-19}}</ref> [[Streamline Moderne]] style structure would be added to the [[National Register of Historic Places listings in Cambridge, Massachusetts]] in 1982.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bulfinch.com/case_study/784-memorial-drive/ |title=784 Memorial Drive |publisher=The Bulfinch Companies, Inc. |accessdate=2019-09-19}}</ref>

When Kodak announced instant film cameras in 1976, Polaroid announced they were suing them, accusing Kodak of having stolen its patented instant photography process.<ref name="boston-history-polaroid" /> In the two years that followed the lawsuit, total sales of instant cameras climbed from 7.4 million cameras in 1976 to 10.3 million in 1977 and 14.3 million in 1978. The suit in federal court lasted 10 years. Polaroid asked for $12 billion for infringements of its patents by Kodak. The court ruled in favor of Polaroid, and ordered Kodak to cease instant picture production, plus pay Polaroid $909.5 million of the $12 billion it had asked for.<ref name="boston-history-polaroid" />

===Decline===
In 1977, Land introduced the Polaroid Instant Home Movie camera named [[Polavision]], based on the [[Dufaycolor]] process. However, the product arrived on the market when videotape-based systems were rapidly gaining popularity. Thus it failed to sell well in retail stores and has been described as the swan song for Polaroid. After four decades as chairman, Edwin Land was coerced into resigning and leaving the corporation he had founded. He died in 1991. The ''Polavision'' debacle eventually caused the company to write off $89 million,<ref name="boston-history-polaroid" /> including most of the manufactured products. The underlying technology of Polavision was later improved for use in the [[Polavision, Polachrome and Polapan#Polachrome and Polapan|Polachrome]] instant slide film system.{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}}

In the 1980s, Polaroid tried to reinvent itself without Land at its helm by shifting away from a dependence on consumer photography, a market which was in steady decline. In 1984 Polaroid announced "that it would enter the United States
electronic video market with its own line of Polaroid videotapes."

Polaroid was forced to make wholesale changes that included having to fire thousands of workers and close many factories. The 1990s saw the advent of new technologies that profoundly changed the world of photography — one-hour color film processing, single-use cameras from competitors, videotape camcorders, and digital cameras.<ref name="boston-history-polaroid" />

The company also was one of the early manufacturers of digital cameras, with the PDC-2000 in 1996;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.epi-centre.com/reports/9604ahs.html|title=Polaroid PDC-2000 Digital Camera|date=|work=Epi-centre.com|accessdate=2015-05-09}}</ref> however, they failed to capture a large market share in that segment.

They also made 35&nbsp;mm and multi format scanners, such as Polaroid SprintScan 4000 35&nbsp;mm scanner<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shutterbug.com/content/polaroid-sprintscan-4000|title=The Polaroid SprintScan 4000|date=1999-09-01|work=Shutterbug.com|accessdate=2015-05-09}}</ref> (the first scanner with a 4000 DPI CCD) in 1999, and the Polaroid PrintScan 120 in 2000. The scanners received mixed reviews and saw heavy competition from Nikon and Minolta products. The entire line was discontinued when Polaroid entered bankruptcy in 2001.{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}}

Prior to bankruptcy, the company sold its landmark, historic<ref>{{cite web |url=https://cambridgehistory.org/innovation/Polaroid.html |title=Polaroid 784 Memorial Drive |publisher=Cambridge Historical Society |accessdate=2019-09-19}}</ref> headquarters building and surrounding property to [[The Bulfinch Companies]] for $10 million.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bizjournals.com/boston/stories/2000/02/21/story4.html |title=Polaroid to sell landmark Cambridge headquarters |publisher=American City Business Journals |accessdate=2019-09-19}}</ref>

=== Bankruptcy and the "new" Polaroid Corporation ===

==== "Chapter 11" controversy ====
The original Polaroid Corporation filed for federal [[bankruptcy]] protection on October 11, 2001. The outcome was that within ten months, most of the business (including the "Polaroid" name itself<ref name="pdcshare" /> and non-bankrupt foreign subsidiaries) had been sold to [[Bank One]]'s [[One Equity Partners]] (OEP). OEP Imaging Corporation then changed its name to '''Polaroid Holding Company''' ('''PHC''').<ref name="cfocom">Frieswick, Kris, [http://www.cfo.com/article.cfm/3007726/1/c_3046585 "What's wrong with this picture?"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130721213718/http://www.cfo.com/article.cfm/3007726/1/c_3046585 |date=July 21, 2013 }}, cfo.com.

Press release dated 2002-07-31, Retrieved 2006-12-01.</ref>

Significant criticism surrounded this "takeover" because the process left executives of the company with large bonuses, while stockholders, as well as current and retired employees, were left with nothing. The company announced a plan that gave the top 45 executives bonuses just for staying at their jobs. Meanwhile, other employees were restricted from selling their stock before leaving their jobs.<ref name="boston-history-polaroid" />{{rp|31}}

As part of the settlement, the original Polaroid Corporation changed its name to '''Primary PDC, Inc.'''<ref name="pdcmain" /><ref name="cfocom" /> Having sold its assets, it was now effectively nothing more than an administrative shell. Primary PDC received approximately 35 percent of the "new" Polaroid, which was to be distributed to its [[unsecured creditor]]s<ref name="cfocom" /> (including [[Bond (finance)|bondholders]]).<ref name="imaging">O'Neill, Jerry [http://www.imaginginfo.com/article/article.jsp?id=818&siteSection=27 "The New Polaroid: After Chapter 11"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160611144238/http://www.imaginginfo.com/article/article.jsp?id=818&siteSection=27 |date=June 11, 2016 }}, "From the October 2002 Issue of Imaging Business" via imaginginfo.com.

Polaroid’s bankruptcy is widely attributed to the failure of senior management — unable to anticipate the impact of [[digital cameras]] on its film business.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Tripsas |first1=Mary |last2=Gavetti |first2=Giovanni |title=Capabilities, cognition, and inertia: evidence from digital imaging |journal=Strategic Management Journal |date=October 2000 |volume=21 |issue=10–11 |pages=1147–1161 |doi=10.1002/1097-0266(200010/11)21:10/11<1147::AID-SMJ128>3.0.CO;2-R}}</ref> This type of managerial failure is also known as the [[success trap]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Mawdsley |first1=Andrew |title=How can we understand the digital transformation of business? |url=http://www.hbs.edu/openforum/openforum.hbs.org/goto/challenge/understand-digital-transformation-of-business/despite-epic-head-start-in-digital-imaging-polaroid-fails-to-make-transformation-to-digital-cameras.html |website=Open Forum Project, Harvard Business School Digital Initiative |accessdate=22 December 2018}}</ref><!-- NOT really a good source, but it is what it is.--><ref>{{cite magazine |last1=Reeves |first1=Martin |last2=Harnoss |first2=Johann |title=Don't Let Your Company Get Trapped by Success |url=https://hbr.org/2015/11/dont-let-your-company-get-trapped-by-success |magazine=Harvard Business Review |accessdate=22 December 2018 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160312044035/https://hbr.org/2015/11/dont-let-your-company-get-trapped-by-success |archivedate=2016-03-12 |date=November 19, 2015 }}</ref><!--better ref-->

==== Use of Polaroid brand following bankruptcy ====
After the bankruptcy, the Polaroid brand was licensed for use on other products with the assistance of [[Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom]]. In September 2002, World Wide Licenses, a subsidiary of The Character Group plc, was granted the exclusive rights for three years to manufacture and sell digital cameras under the Polaroid brand for distribution internationally.<ref name="wwlpr">[http://www.cool-icam.com/web/eng/press/PolaroidInt'l1.pdf Press release for camera licensing agreement (PDF)]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160104204731/http://www.cool-icam.com/web/eng/press/PolaroidInt%27l1.pdf |date=January 4, 2016 }}, World Wide Licenses Ltd. Article dated 2002-09-24, retrieved 2006-12-01.</ref> Polaroid branded [[LCD television|LCDs]] and [[plasma television]]s and portable [[DVD player]]s had also appeared on the market.

On April 27, 2005, [[Petters Group Worldwide]] announced its acquisition of PHC. Petters has in the past bought up failed companies with well-known names for the value of those names. The same year, [[Flextronics]] purchased Polaroid's manufacturing operations and the decision was made to send most of the manufacturing to China.<ref>[http://www.rrpc-ny.org/Data/newsletter/27_sept_05nl.htm] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060413195906/http://www.rrpc-ny.org/Data/newsletter/27_sept_05nl.htm|date=April 13, 2006}}</ref> It stopped making Polaroid cameras in 2007 and discontinued the sale of Polaroid film after 2009 to the dismay of loyal consumers.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/02/08/polaroid-abandons-instant-photography/?hp|title=Polaroid Abandons Instant Photography|last=Lyons|first=Patrick J.|date=2008-02-08|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2015-05-09}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.manufacturing.net/News-Polaroid-Instant-Film-In-Demand.aspx?menuid=36|title=Industries Frantic To Find Polaroid Instant Film|date=2008-02-14|work=Manufacturing.net|accessdate=2015-05-09|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111011162936/http://www.manufacturing.net/News-Polaroid-Instant-Film-In-Demand.aspx?menuid=36|archivedate=October 11, 2011}}</ref> On December 18, 2008, the post-reorganization Polaroid Corp. filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Minnesota.

==== Auction for Polaroid Corporation's assets ====
On April 2, 2009, Patriarch Partners won an auction for Polaroid Corporation's assets including the company's name, intellectual property, and [[Polaroid Collection|photography collection]]. Patriarch's $59.1 million bid beat bids from PHC Acquisitions, Hilco Consumer Capital Corp and Ritchie Capital.<ref>https://www.reuters.com/article/polaroid-auction/update-2-patriarch-wins-polaroid-auction-idUSN0227748920090403</ref>

This led to some very contentious fighting and litigation, and Patriarch wound up walking away in early May 2009, and a joint venture between [[Gordon Brothers Group|Gordon Brothers Brands LLC]] and Hilco Consumer Capital LP picked up the pieces. Quoting from a Reuters report which quoted some participants:

<blockquote>The move by New York-based Patriarch, a private-equity firm, [to drop their claim], follows US District Judge James Rosenbaum's ruling on Thursday in Minneapolis that putting the purchase on hold during appeal would threaten operations at Polaroid, which is spending its cash at a rate of $3 million a month.{{Verify quote|date=July 2020}}</blockquote>

On April 16, 2009, Polaroid won US Bankruptcy Court approval to be sold to a joint venture of Hilco Consumer Capital LP of Toronto and Gordon Brothers Brands LLC of Boston.<ref>[http://www.boston.com/business/articles/2009/05/05/polaroid_sale_can_proceed_judge_rules/ "Polaroid sale can proceed, judge rules", ''The Boston Globe''.

Hilco Consumer Capital and Gordon Brothers Brands announced the closing of the purchase of Polaroid Corporation on May 7, 2009, placing Polaroid Corporation in joint holding under a parent company named '''PLR IP Holdings, LLC'''. Former Executive Vice President and General Manager – Americas, Scott W. Hardy was named as the new President of Polaroid Corporation and PLR IP Holdings, LLC.

===Corporate sponsorship of motorsports===
In the 1990s, Polaroid was involved in corporate sponsorship of [[NASCAR]]. For several years, Polaroid was the principal sponsor of NASCAR's 125 mile [[Whelen Modified Tour|Featherlite Modified]] race at Watkins Glen and it was called the "Polaroid 125". The Polaroid name was also used in sponsorship in the NASCAR [[Xfinity Series|Busch Series]]. In 1992, Polaroid was the principal sponsor of female NASCAR driver Shawna Robinson's #25 Oldsmobile in the Busch Series. They continued as her principal sponsor when she moved to the other car numbers in 1993 and 1994.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.racing-reference.info/drivdet?id=robinsh01&yr=1993&series=B |title=Shawna Robinson 1993 NASCAR Busch Grand National Series Results |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2014-02-25}}</ref>

=== Discontinuation and planned relaunch of Polaroid film ===
On February 8, 2008, Polaroid (under the control of Thomas J. Petters of Petters Group Worldwide) announced that the company has decided to gradually cease production and withdraw from analog instant film products completely in 2008.<ref name="polaroid_notification">{{cite web|url=http://www.polaroid.com/ifilm/en/index.html |title=Notification of Polaroid Instant Film Availability |date=2008-02-18 |work=Polaroid Corporation |accessdate=2009-06-20 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090607014550/http://www.polaroid.com/ifilm/en/index.html |archivedate=June 7, 2009 }}</ref> Since March 2010, instant film materials for vintage Polaroid cameras have again become available on the market, developed and manufactured by a group called The [[Polaroid Originals|Impossible Project]], at the former Polaroid production plant in [[Enschede]], [[Netherlands]].<ref name="Guardian1">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2010/apr/05/polaroid-impossible-project-instant-photography|title=The Polaroid revival|date=5 April 2010|work=The Guardian|publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited|location=London|author=[[Sean O'Hagan (journalist)|Sean O'Hagan]]|accessdate=8 December 2011}}</ref><ref name="impossible">{{cite web|url=https://shop.the-impossible-project.com/shop/film|title=Shop for Film {{!}} Impossible.

Austrian photographer Florian Kaps, the owner of the largest online vendor for [[Polaroid SX-70|SX-70]] films and organizer of the web-based instant photo gallery Polanoid.net, had bought the approximately 500,000 film packages that were on stock. He teamed with André Bosman, a former head of film production in the large Polaroid film factory at Enschede, designed a plan to redesign the SX-70/600 film system in collaboration with [[Ilford Photo]], and convinced the Polaroid owners to participate. Plans for a relaunch under the Impossible label were announced in January 2009.<ref name="dugan">{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/smile-polaroid-is-saved-1418929.html|title=Smile!

On March 22, 2010, Impossible announced the release of two monochromatic films, PX100 and PX600, compatible with SX-70 and 600 type cameras, respectively.<ref name="bjp">{{cite news|url=http://www.bjp-online.com/public/showPage.html?page=873885 |title=Impossible relaunches Polaroid's instant films, ends three years of speculations |date=2010-03-22 |work=British Journal of Photography |accessdate=2010-03-23 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100325003856/http://www.bjp-online.com/public/showPage.html?page=873885 |archivedate=March 25, 2010 }}</ref> Color films were initially released in 2010 for SX-70 type cameras, followed in 2011 with the release of much improved color films for Polaroid 600, SX-70 and Spectra Cameras.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://petapixel.com/2011/05/05/impossible-launches-new-color-instant-film-for-polaroid-lovers/|title=Impossible Launches New Color Instant Film for Polaroid Lovers|website=petapixel.com|access-date=2019-10-22}}</ref>

Then Impossible had originally announced a new camera that was going to be styled after older Polaroid models to coincide with the new film. So, the camera was due to come out before Christmas 2010, but the deadline was not met with no new information on the camera.{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}} Then sometime after that, Impossible released a camera that did not look like any of the older Polaroid models. The camera was called the Impossible I-1 and it was the first camera to use I-type Film and was backwards compatible with 600 Film due to I-type film being 600 film without a battery. Then sometime after the rebranding to Polaroid Originals in September 2017, Polaroid Originals came out with another camera. The camera was called the OneStep 2, which was modeled after the original [[Polaroid OneStep|OneStep]] with new features as originally planned. But the OneStep 2 used the same type of film as the Impossible I-1 unlike the OneStep that used SX-70 Film.

On April 28, 2012, the documentary "Time Zero: The Last Year of Polaroid Film", directed by Grant Hamilton, was released in the U.S. It covers the rise, fall, and grass-roots revival of Polaroid's instant film technology.<ref>{{cite web|title=Time Zero Movie|url=http://timezeromovie.com/|website=Time Zero Movie|accessdate=April 3, 2015}}</ref>

=== Mobile printers ===
In summer 2008 Polaroid released the PoGo, an instant photo printer producing {{convert|2|x|3|in}} prints. It uses the [[Zink (technology)|Zink]] ("zero ink") technology which is similar to [[dye sublimation]] but has the dye crystals embedded in the photo paper itself.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://zink.com |title=Home Page &#124; ZINK Imaging |work=Zink.com |date=2013-01-27 |accessdate=2015-05-09}}</ref> Models CZA-10011B and CZA-20011B exist (which Polaroid claim to be identical).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.polaroid.com/faqs/photo-printer-faqs/what-is-the-difference-between-a-cza-10011-cza-20011-and-a-pogo-printer |accessdate=12 February 2014 |publisher=PLR Ecommerce |title=What is the difference between a CZA-10011, CZA-20011 and a PoGo Printer? |quote=PoGo printer is the common name for the original Polaroid Instant Mobile printer which produces 2*3 instant prints.

=== Digital photography ===
Polaroid released a line of cameras without printers including the t1035, a 10-megapixel digital camera.<ref>[http://store.polaroid.com/media/document/t1035_manual_EN20090715.pdf Polaroid t1035 digital camera]{{dead link|date=January 2016}}</ref>

In January 2012, Polaroid announced a new "smart camera", entitled the Polaroid SC1630 smart camera, which is powered by [[Google Android]]. The SC1630 is a combination of a camera and a [[portable media player]], that allows users to take photos with a built-in 16 MP HD camera, download apps from [[Google Play]], check their email, and browse the web. The built-in camera allows 3X optical zoom. Other features on the media player include [[wi-fi]], [[touch screen]], [[geotagging]], smart albums, and 32&nbsp;GB of storage via a micro [[SD card]].<ref>{{cite press release |url=http://www.polaroid.com/en/press/2012/1/10/polaroid-announces-sc1630-smart-camera |title=Polaroid Announces the Sc1630 Smart Camera Powered by Android |website=Polaroid |accessdate=March 3, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120315133351/http://www.polaroid.com/en/press/2012/1/10/polaroid-announces-sc1630-smart-camera |archivedate=March 15, 2012 }}</ref>

In September 2014 Polaroid introduced a $99 [[action camera]] named the "Polaroid Cube", marketed as an alternative to cameras such as the GoPro Hero (which retails for $129), specifically for casual, light users of action camcorders.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Alvarez|first1=Edgar|title=IRL: The Polaroid Cube is a tiny camera that leaves you wanting more|url=https://www.engadget.com/2015/01/01/irl-polaroid-cube/|accessdate=April 3, 2015}}</ref> In 2015 [[GoPro]] released the similar GoPro HERO4 Session.

=== Wideblue ===

In March 2006, the specialist design and development department in Polaroid's [[Vale of Leven]] plant in Scotland was bought out by its management team.
