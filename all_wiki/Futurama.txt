'''''Futurama''''' <!-- see [[WP:TVNOW]]-->i<!--DO NOT-->s<!--change to "was"--> an American [[Animation|animated]] [[science fiction]] [[animated sitcom|sitcom]] created by [[Matt Groening]] that aired on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] from March 28, 1999 to August 10, 2003 and on [[Comedy Central]] from March 23, 2008 to September 4, 2013. The series follows the adventures of slacker [[Philip J. Fry]], who is [[cryonics|cryogenically preserved]] for 1000 years and is revived in the 31st century. Fry finds work at an interplanetary delivery company, working alongside the one-eyed [[Leela (Futurama)|Turanga Leela]] and robot [[Bender (Futurama)|Bender Bending Rodriguez]]. The series was envisioned by Groening in the mid-1990s while working on ''[[The Simpsons]]''; he brought [[David X. Cohen]] aboard to develop storylines and characters to pitch the show to Fox.

Following its initial cancellation by Fox, ''Futurama'' began airing reruns on [[Cartoon Network]]'s [[Adult Swim]] programming block, which lasted from 2003 to 2007. It was revived that year as four [[direct-to-video]] films, the last of which was released in early 2009. [[Comedy Central]] entered into an agreement with [[20th Century Fox Television]] to syndicate the existing episodes and air the films as 16 new, half-hour episodes, constituting a fifth season.<ref name=RottenTomatoesMattGroenigClarifiesFuture>{{cite news|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/news/1648183/ |title=Groening's Bargain to Yield Four ''Futurama'' Movies |agency=Reuters |date=January 28, 2007 |accessdate=June 3, 2008 |first=Fred |last=Topel |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080416100052/http://www.rottentomatoes.com/news/1648183/ |archive-date=April 16, 2008  }}</ref><ref name=reuters>{{cite news|last=Wallenstein |first=Andrew |url=http://entertainment.tv.yahoo.com/entnews/va/20060622/115104459800.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061106224128/http://entertainment.tv.yahoo.com/entnews/va/20060622/115104459800.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=November 6, 2006 |title="Futurama" gets new life on Comedy Central |agency=Reuters |date=June 22, 2006 |accessdate=June 3, 2008 }}</ref>

==Production==

===Development===
The television network Fox expressed a strong desire in the mid-1990s for [[Matt Groening]] to create a new series, and he began conceiving ''Futurama'' during this period. In 1996, he enlisted [[David X. Cohen]], then a writer and producer for ''The Simpsons'', to assist in developing the show. The two spent time researching science fiction books, television shows, and films. When they pitched the series to Fox in April 1998, Groening and Cohen had composed many characters and story lines; Groening claimed they had gone "overboard" in their discussions.<ref name="theface">{{cite journal |last=Needham |first=Alex |url=http://www.frcr.com/library/the_face1.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20000824051707/http://www.frcr.com/library/the_face1.html |archive-date=August 24, 2000 |title=Nice Planet...We'll Take It! |journal=The Face |issue=33 |date=October 1999}}</ref> Groening described trying to get the show on the air as "by far the worst experience of my grown-up life".<ref name="motherjones">{{cite web | title=Matt Groening | work=[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]] | url=https://www.motherjones.com/media/1999/03/matt-groening | last=Doherty | first=Brian | date=March–April 1999 | accessdate=January 14, 2007 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090416213422/http://www.motherjones.com/media/1999/03/matt-groening | archive-date=April 16, 2009 | url-status=dead }}</ref>

Fox ordered thirteen episodes. Immediately after, however, Fox feared the themes of the show were not suitable for the network and Groening and Fox executives argued over whether the network would have any creative input into the show.<ref name="theface"/> With ''The Simpsons'', the network has no input.<ref name="Snierson">{{cite news |first= Dan|last=Snierson|url=http://www.frcr.com/library/ew_online1.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20000824042829/http://www.frcr.com/library/ew_online1.html|archive-date=August 24, 2000| title= Space Case|work= [[Entertainment Weekly]]| date= March 26, 1999| accessdate= June 3, 2008}}</ref> Fox was particularly disturbed by the concept of [[suicide booth]]s, [[Zoidberg|Doctor Zoidberg]], and [[Bender (Futurama)|Bender]]'s anti-social behavior.<ref name=1ACV03Production2>{{cite video| people= Cohen, David X.; Groening, Moore, Rich; Vanzo, Gregg; Horsted, Eric; Haaland, Bret; West, Billy|year= 2002| title= Futurama: Volume One DVD commentary for the episode "[[I, Roommate]]"| medium= DVD| publisher= 20th Century Fox| quote='''Matt Groening:''' Well, I think that's a good idea– I always wanted to have Bachelor Chow right now and so– this was– Anyway, the network really– really was freaked out by the show, the suicide booths– and lobster creatures and Bender being so anti-social and so– yeah, this was our show to tone things down.

The name ''Futurama'' comes from a pavilion at the [[1939 New York World's Fair]].

===Executive producers===
[[File:David X. Cohen & Matt Groening by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|left|[[David X. Cohen]] and [[Matt Groening]] at the ''Futurama'' panel of [[San Diego Comic-Con International|Comic-Con]] 2009.]]

Groening and Cohen served as executive producers and [[showrunner]]s during the show's entire run, and also functioned as creative consultants. [[Ken Keeler]] became an executive producer for Season 4 and subsequent seasons.

===Writing===
The planning for each episode began with a table meeting of writers, who discussed the plot ideas as a group. The writers are given index cards with plot points that they are required to use as the center of activity in each episode. A single staff writer wrote an outline and then produced a script. Once the first draft of a script was finished, the writers and executive producers called in the actors for a table read.<ref name="Needham">{{cite news|first=Alex|last=Needham|url=http://www.frcr.com/library/the_face1.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20000824051707/http://www.frcr.com/library/the_face1.html|archive-date=August 24, 2000|title=Nice Planet...We'll Take It!|date=October 1999|accessdate=June 3, 2008}}</ref> After this script reading, the writers collaborated to rewrite the script as a group before sending it to the animation team.<ref name="DXC Interview">{{cite web|url=http://www.gotfuturama.com/Information/Articles/DavidInterview/DavidXCohenInterview.dhtml|title=David X Cohen interview with GotFuturama.com|accessdate=June 3, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081015203707/http://www.gotfuturama.com/Information/Articles/DavidInterview/DavidXCohenInterview.dhtml|archive-date=October 15, 2008|url-status=live}}</ref> At this point the voice recording was also started and the script was out of the writers' hands.<ref name="SciFiWeekly2" />

The writing staff held three [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.s]], seven [[master's degree]]s, and cumulatively had more than 50 years at [[Harvard University]]. Series writer [[Patric Verrone|Patric M. Verrone]] stated, "we were easily the most overeducated cartoon writers in history".<ref>{{cite web|last1=Verrone|first1=Patric M.|title=Welcome to the War of Tomorrow|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/future_tense/2014/09/futurama_writer_patric_verrone_on_how_the_cartoon_depicted_asymmetrical.html|website=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|publisher=[[The Slate Group]]|accessdate=September 22, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140922054315/http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/future_tense/2014/09/futurama_writer_patric_verrone_on_how_the_cartoon_depicted_asymmetrical.html|archive-date=September 22, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Voice actors===

''Futurama'' had eight main cast members. [[Billy West]] performed the voices of [[Fry (Futurama)|Philip J.

[[Katey Sagal]] voiced [[Leela (Futurama)|Leela]], and is the only member of the main cast to voice only one character. The role of Leela was originally assigned to [[Nicole Sullivan]].<ref name="IGNBW" /> In an interview in June 2010, Sagal remarked that she did not know that another person was to originally voice Leela until many years after the show first began.<ref name="Futurama-rama">{{cite news| url=http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/06/24/futurama-rama-welcome-back-to-the-world-of-tomorrow/| title='Futurama'-Rama: Welcome Back to the World of Tomorrow| author=Itzkoff, Dave| work=The New York Times| date=June 24, 2010| accessdate=July 8, 2010| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110813011425/http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/06/24/futurama-rama-welcome-back-to-the-world-of-tomorrow/| archive-date=August 13, 2011| url-status=live}}</ref>

[[John DiMaggio]] performed the voice of the robot [[Bender (Futurama)|Bender Bending Rodríguez]] and other, more minor, characters.

[[Phil LaMarr]] voices [[Hermes Conrad]], his son Dwight, Ethan Bubblegum Tate, and Reverend Preacherbot.

In addition to the main cast, [[Frank Welker]] voiced Nibbler and [[Kath Soucie]] voiced Cubert and several supporting and minor characters. Like ''The Simpsons'', many episodes of ''Futurama'' feature guest voices from a wide range of professions, including actors, entertainers, bands, musicians, and scientists. Many guest-stars voiced supporting characters, although many voiced themselves, usually as their own head preserved in a jar. Recurring guest stars included [[Dawnn Lewis]] (as Hermes' wife [[List of recurring characters in Futurama#LaBarbara Conrad|LaBarbara]]), [[Tom Kenny]], [[Dan Castellaneta]] (as [[List of recurring characters in Futurama#Robot Devil|the Robot Devil]]), [[Al Gore]], and [[George Takei]], among others.

===Animation===
[[File:FuturamaExplosionCGI.jpg|thumb|Computer-generated explosion]]
[[Rough Draft Studios]] animated ''Futurama''. The studio would receive the completed script of an episode and create a [[storyboard]] consisting of more than 100 drawings. It would then produce a pencil-drawn [[Animatics|animatic]] with 1,000 frames. Rough Draft's sister studio in South Korea would render the 30,000-frame finished episode.<ref name="Needham" />

In addition to traditional cartoon drawing, Rough Draft Studios often used [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] for fast or complex shots, such as the movement of [[Spacecraft|spaceships]], explosions, [[nebula]]e, large crowds, and snow scenes. The opening sequence was entirely rendered in CGI. The CGI was rendered at 24 [[Frame rate|frames per second]] (as opposed to hand-drawn often done at 12 frames per second) and the lack of [[Digital artifact|artifacts]] made the animation appear very smooth and fluid. CGI characters looked slightly different due to spatially "cheating" hand-drawn characters by drawing slightly out of proportion or off-perspective features to emphasize traits of the face or body, improving legibility of an expression. [[PowerAnimator]] was used to draw the comic-like CGI.<ref name="Scott Vanzo">{{cite web|url=http://www.peelified.com/Futurama-Forum-1/Topic-520-0-D_Animation_in_Futurama.html|title=Scott Vanzo of Rough Draft Studios e-mail response|accessdate=June 20, 2001|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216142456/http://www.peelified.com/Futurama-Forum-1/Topic-520-0-D_Animation_in_Futurama.html|archive-date=December 16, 2008|url-status=live}}</ref>

The series began high-definition production in [[Futurama (season 5)|season 5]], with ''[[Futurama: Bender's Big Score|Bender's Big Score]]''. The opening sequence was re-rendered and scaled to adapt to the show's transition to 16:9 [[widescreen]] format.

For the [[Reincarnation (Futurama)|final episode]] of [[Futurama (season 6)|season 6]], ''Futurama'' was completely reanimated in three different styles: the first segment of the episode features black-and-white [[Fleischer Studios|Fleischer]]- and [[Walter Lantz]]-style animation, the second was drawn in the style of a [[Display resolution|low-resolution]] video game, and the final segment was in the style of Japanese [[anime]].<ref name=YahooDXC>{{cite web|url=https://tv.yahoo.com/news/article/ustv.associatedcontent.com/ustv.associatedcontent.com-futurama-producer-david-x-cohen-talks-holiday-special|title='Futurama' Producer David X.

*[[Philip J. Fry]] ([[Billy West (voice actor)|Billy West]]) – Fry is an immature, slovenly, yet good-hearted and sensitive pizza [[Delivery (commerce)|delivery boy]] who falls into a cryogenic pod, causing it to activate and [[cryonics|freeze]] him just after midnight on January 1, 2000. He reawakens on New Year's Eve of 2999, and gets a job as a cargo delivery boy at Planet Express, a company owned by his only living relative, Professor Hubert J. Farnsworth. Fry's love for Leela is a recurring theme throughout the series.
*[[Leela (Futurama)|Turanga Leela]] ([[Katey Sagal]]) – Leela is the competent, [[List of one-eyed creatures in mythology and fiction|one-eyed]] captain of the Planet Express Ship.<ref name="locus" /> Abandoned as a baby, she grows up in the Cookieville Minimum Security [[orphanage|Orphanarium]] believing herself to be an [[extraterrestrial life|alien]] from another planet, but learns that she is actually a [[List of recurring Futurama characters#Sewer mutants|mutant from the sewers]] in the episode "[[Leela's Homeworld]]".<ref name="LeelasHomeworld">{{cite episode| episode-link=Leela's Homeworld| title=Leela's Homeworld| series= Futurama| network=[[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox Network]] | airdate=February 17, 2002 | season=4 | number=2}}</ref> Prior to becoming the ship's captain, Leela works as a career assignment officer at the [[cryonics|cryogenics]] lab where she first meets Fry.

*[[Bender (Futurama)|Bender Bending Rodriguez]] ([[John DiMaggio]]) – Bender is a [[profanity|foul-mouthed]], heavy-drinking, cigar-smoking, [[kleptomania]]cal, [[Misanthropy|misanthropic]], egocentric, ill-tempered [[robot]] manufactured by [[Mom (Futurama)|Mom's Friendly Robot Company]]. He is originally programmed to bend girders for [[suicide booth]]s, and is later designated as assistant sales manager and cook, despite lacking a sense of taste. He is Fry's best friend and [[roommate]]. He must drink heavily to power his fuel cells and becomes the robot equivalent of drunk when low on alcohol.<ref name="I, Roommate">{{cite episode |title=I, Roommate |episode-link=I, Roommate |series=Futurama |network=Fox Network |airdate=April 6, 1999 |season=1 |number=3 |minutes=10}}</ref>
*[[Professor Farnsworth|Professor Hubert J. Farnsworth]] (Billy West) – Professor Farnsworth, also known simply as "the Professor", is Fry's distant nephew.<ref name="ACloneofMyOwn">{{cite episode |title=A Clone of My Own |episode-link=A Clone of My Own |series=Futurama |network=Fox Network |airdate=April 9, 2000 |season=2 |number=3 |minutes=10}}</ref> Farnsworth founds Planet Express Inc. to fund his work as a [[mad scientist]]. Although he is depicted as a brilliant scientist and inventor, at more than one-hundred and sixty years old he is extremely prone to age-related forgetfulness and fits of temper. In the episode "A Clone of My Own", the Professor clones himself to produce a successor, [[List of recurring Futurama characters#Cubert Farnsworth|Cubert Farnsworth]] (Voiced by [[Kath Soucie]]), whom he treats like a son.
*[[Amy Wong]] ([[Lauren Tom]]) – Amy is an incredibly rich, blunt, spoiled, ditzy, and accident-prone long-term [[Internship|intern]] at Planet Express. She is an astrophysics student at [[Mars University]] and heiress to the western hemisphere of [[Mars]]. Born on Mars, she is ethnically [[Han Chinese|Chinese]] and is prone to cursing in [[Cantonese]] and using 31st-century slang. Her parents are the wealthy ranchers [[List of recurring Futurama characters#Leo and Inez Wong|Leo and Inez Wong]]. She is [[Promiscuity|promiscuous]] in the beginning of the series, but eventually enters a monogamous relationship with [[List of recurring Futurama characters#Kif Kroker|Kif Kroker]]. In the show's sixth season, she acquires her doctorate.
*[[Hermes Conrad]] ([[Phil LaMarr]]) – Hermes is the [[Jamaica]]n accountant of Planet Express. A 36th-level [[bureaucrat]] (demoted to level 37 during the series) and proud of it, he is a stickler for regulation and enamored of the tedium of paperwork and bureaucracy. Hermes is also a former champion in Olympic Limbo, a sport derived from the [[Limbo (dance)|popular party activity]]. He gave up limbo after the 2980 Olympics when a young fan, imitating him, broke his back and died. Hermes has a wife, [[LaBarbara Conrad|LaBarbara]], and a 12-year-old son, [[Dwight Conrad|Dwight]].
*[[Zoidberg|Dr. John A. Zoidberg]] (Billy West) – Zoidberg is a Decapodian, a [[lobster]]-like alien from the planet [[Zoidberg|Decapod 10]], and the neurotic staff physician of Planet Express. Although he claims to be an expert on humans, his knowledge of human anatomy and physiology is woefully inaccurate (at one point, he states that his doctorate is actually in art history). Zoidberg's expertise seems to be with extra-terrestrial creatures. Homeless and penniless, he lives in the dumpster behind Planet Express. Although Zoidberg is depicted as being Professor Farnsworth's long-time friend, he is held in contempt by everyone on the crew.
*[[Zapp Brannigan]] (Billy West) – Zapp Brannigan is the incompetent, extraordinarily vain captain of the [[DOOP]] starship ''Nimbus''. Although Leela thoroughly detests him, Brannigan—a self-deluded [[Seduction|ladies' man]]—pursues her relentlessly, often at great personal risk. He was originally going to be voiced by [[Phil Hartman]], but Hartman died before production could begin.<ref name="IGNBW" /><ref name="TV Squad" />
*[[List of recurring Futurama characters#Kif Kroker|Kif Kroker]] ([[Maurice LaMarche]]) – Zapp Brannigan's 4th Lieutenant and long-suffering personal assistant, Kif is a member of the amphibious species that inhabits the planet Amphibios 9. Although extremely timid, he eventually works up the courage to date Amy. Kif is often shown sighing in disgust at the nonsensical rantings of his commanding officer.
*[[Mom (Futurama)|Carol "Mom"]] ([[Tress MacNeille]]) – Mom is the malevolent, foul-mouthed, cruel, and narcissistic owner of MomCorp, the thirty-first century's largest shipping and manufacturing company, with a monopoly on robots. In public, she maintains the image of a sweet, kindly old woman by speaking in stereotypically antiquated statements and wearing a mechanical fat suit. She occasionally launches insidious plans for world domination and corporate takeover. She has a romantic history with the Professor which left her bitter and resentful. She has three bumbling sons, Walt, Larry, and Igner (modeled after [[The Three Stooges]]), who do her bidding despite frequent abuse, and often infuriate her with their incompetence. In ''[[Futurama: Bender's Game|Bender's Game]]'', it is revealed that Igner's father is Professor Farnsworth. Zoidberg in the episode "[[The Tip of the Zoidberg]]" refers to Mom as Carol, which is assumed to be her first name.
*[[List of recurring Futurama characters#Nibbler|Nibbler]] ([[Frank Welker]]) – Nibbler is Leela's pet Nibblonian, whom she rescues from an imploding planet and adopts in the episode "[[Love's Labours Lost in Space]]". Despite his deceptively cute exterior, Nibbler is actually a highly intelligent super-being whose race is responsible for maintaining order in the universe. He is revealed in "[[The Why of Fry]]" to have been directly responsible for Fry's [[cryonics|cryogenics freezing]]. While the size of an average house cat, his race is capable of devouring much larger animals. He [[defecation|defecates]] [[dark matter]], which until ''Bender's Game'' is used as fuel for space cruisers in the series.

==Setting ==
{{more citations needed section|date=August 2013}}
''Futurama'' is set in New New York at the turn of the 31st century, in a time filled with technological wonders. The city of New New York has been built over the ruins of present-day New York City, which has become a catacomb-like space that acts as New New York's sewer, referred to as "Old New York". Various devices and architecture are similar to the [[Googie architecture|Populuxe]] style. [[Global warming]], inflexible [[bureaucracy]], and [[substance abuse]] are a few of the subjects given a 31st-century exaggeration in a world where the problems have become both more extreme and more common. Just as New York has become a more extreme version of itself in the future, other Earth locations are given the same treatment; Los Angeles, for example, is depicted as a smog-filled apocalyptic wasteland.

Numerous technological advances have been made between the present day and the 31st century. The Head Museum, which keeps a collection of heads [[isolated brain|alive in jars]] and was invented by [[Ron Popeil]] (who has a guest cameo in "[[A Big Piece of Garbage]]"), has resulted in many historical figures and current celebrities being present, including Groening himself; this became the writers' device to feature and poke fun at contemporary celebrities in the show. Several of the preserved heads shown are those of people who were already dead well before the advent of this technology; one of the most prominent examples of this anomaly is Earth president [[Richard Nixon]], who died in 1994 and appears in numerous episodes. The Internet, while being fully immersive and encompassing all senses—even featuring its own digital world (similar to ''[[Tron]]'' or ''[[The Matrix (franchise)|The Matrix]]'')—is slow and largely consists of pornography, [[pop-up ad]]s, and "filthy" (or Filthy Filthy) [[chat room]]s. Some of it is edited to include educational material ostensibly for youth. Television is still a primary form of entertainment. Self-aware robots are a common sight, and are the main cause of global warming due to the exhaust from their [[ethanol fuel|alcohol-powered]] systems. The wheel is obsolete (no one but Fry even seems to recognize the design),<ref name="MothersDay">{{cite episode | title=Mother's Day | episode-link=Mother's Day (Futurama) | series=Futurama | network=Fox Network | airdate=May 14, 2000 | season=2 | number=14}}</ref> having been forgotten and replaced by [[Hovercar|hover cars]] and a network of large, clear [[Pneumatic tube|pneumatic transportation tubes]].

Environmentally, common animals still remain, alongside mutated, cross-bred (sometimes with humans) and extraterrestrial animals. Ironically, spotted owls are often shown to have replaced rats as common household pests. Although rats still exist, sometimes rats act like pigeons, though pigeons still exist, as well. Anchovies have been extinct for 800 years. Earth still suffers the effects of [[greenhouse gas]]es, although in [[Xmas Story|one episode]] Leela states that its effects have been counteracted by [[nuclear winter]]. In another episode, the [[effects of global warming]] have been somewhat mitigated by the dropping of a giant ice cube into the ocean, and later by pushing Earth farther away from the sun, which also extended the year by one week.

Religion is a prominent part of society, although the dominant religions have evolved. A merging of the [[major religious groups]] of the 20th century has resulted in the First Amalgamated Church,<ref name="Gospel">{{cite book |last=Pinsky |first=Mark |title=The Gospel According to the Simpsons. Bigger and possibly even Better! edition |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-664-23265-8 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/gospelaccordingt0000pins/page/229 229–235] |url=https://archive.org/details/gospelaccordingt0000pins/page/229 }}</ref> while [[Haitian Vodou|Voodoo]] is now mainstream. New religions include [[Oprah Winfrey|Oprahism]], [[Religion in Futurama|Robotology]], and the banned religion of [[Trekkie|''Star Trek'' fandom]]. Religious figures include [[List of recurring Futurama characters#Father Changstein-El-Gamal|Father Changstein-El-Gamal]], the [[Robot Devil]], [[Reverend Lionel Preacherbot]], and passing references to the Space Pope, who appears to be a large crocodile-like creature. Several major holidays have robots associated with them, including the murderous Robot Santa and Kwanzaa-bot. While very few episodes focus exclusively on religion within the ''Futurama'' universe, they do cover a wide variety of subjects including predestination, prayer, the nature of salvation, and religious conversion.<ref name="Gospel" />

''Futurama''{{'}}s setting is a backdrop, and the writers are not above committing [[continuity error]]s if they serve to further the gags. For example, while [[Space Pilot 3000|the pilot episode]] implies that the previous Planet Express crew was killed by a space wasp, the later episode "[[The Sting (Futurama)|The Sting]]" is based on the crew having been killed by space bees instead.<ref name="Verrone">[[Patric Verrone|Verrone, Patric M]] (2003), DVD commentary for "The Sting", ''Futurama''.

==Hallmarks==

===Opening sequence===
Much like the [[The Simpsons opening sequence|opening sequence in ''The Simpsons'']] with its [[Chalkboard gag|chalkboard]], [[Sax solo gag|sax solo]], and [[Couch gags|couch gag]]s, ''Futurama'' has a distinctive opening sequence featuring minor gags. As the show begins, blue lights fill the screen and the ''Planet Express Ship'' flies across the screen with the title of the show being spelled out in its wake. Underneath the title is a joke caption such as "Painstakingly drawn before a live audience" or "When you see the robot: DRINK!"<ref name="Azrai">{{cite news|title=Farewell to the funny future|url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-14221036_ITM|author=Azrai, Ahmad|date=October 31, 2004|accessdate=January 10, 2008 | work=Asia Africa Intelligence Wire |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080202153436/http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-14221036_ITM |archive-date=February 2, 2008}}</ref> After flying through downtown New New York and past various recurring characters, the Planet Express ship crashes into a large screen showing a short clip from a classic cartoon. These have included clips from ''[[Quasi at the Quackadero]]'', ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' shorts, cartoons produced by [[Max Fleischer]], a [[The Simpsons shorts|short of ''The Simpsons'']] from a ''[[The Tracey Ullman Show|Tracey Ullman]]'' episode,<ref name="FlikrSlideshow">{{cite web | title=Flickr Slideshow | url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/nachop/sets/450093/show/ | access-date=2007 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151121023557/https://www.flickr.com/photos/nachop/sets/450093/show/ | archive-date=November 21, 2015 | url-status=live }}</ref> the show's own opening sequence in "[[The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings]]" or a scene from the episode. Most episodes in [[Futurama (season 6)|Season 6]] use an [[Abridgement|abridged]] opening sequence, omitting the brief clip of a classic cartoon. "[[That Darn Katz!]]", "[[Benderama]]" and "[[Yo Leela Leela]]" have been the only episodes since "[[Spanish Fry]]" to feature a classic cartoon clip. Several episodes begin with a cold opening before the opening sequence, although these scenes do not always correspond with the episode's plot. The opening sequence has been lampooned several times within the show, in episodes including "[[That's Lobstertainment!]]", "[[The Problem with Popplers]]", as "''Future-roma''" in "[[The Duh-Vinci Code]]" and as "''Futurella''" in "[[Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences]]".

Series director Scott Vanzo has remarked on the difficulty of animating the sequence. It took four to five weeks to fully animate the sequence, and it consists of over 80 levels of [[Computer animation|3D animation]] composited together.<ref name=1ACV04OpeningSequence1>{{cite video|people=Cohen, David X.; Groening, Matt; Kelley, Brian; Sheesley, Brian; Moore, Rich; Vanzo, Scott; DiMaggio, John|year=2002|title=Futurama: Volume One DVD commentary for the episode "[[Love's Labours Lost in Space]]"|medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox|quote='''Scott Vanzo:''' The final is kinda difficult for us to create, it has over 80 levels of 3D animation that are composited together, a lot of cheats, probably the single biggest scene that we have ever done, or at least we view it as a scene, so...

'''Vanzo:''' I think we did it in about four or five weeks, all together.}}</ref> It takes approximately one hour to [[Rendering (computer graphics)|render]] a single frame, and each second of the sequence consists of around 30 frames.<ref name=1ACV04OpeningSequence2>{{cite video|people=Cohen, David X.; Groening, Matt; Kelley, Brian; Sheesley, Brian; Moore, Rich; Vanzo, Scott; DiMaggio, John|year=2002|title=Futurama: Volume One DVD commentary for the episode "[[Love's Labours Lost in Space]]"|medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox|quote='''David X.

'''Scott Vanzo:''' We split it into a lot of different levels, because it was taking so long, and that way we can fix things a lot easier. I would say, probably about an hour a frame for that title. '''Cohen:''' And 30 frames per second? So that adds up.}}</ref>

''Bender's Big Score'' has an extended opening sequence, introducing each of the main characters. In ''[[Futurama: The Beast with a Billion Backs|The Beast with a Billion Backs]]'' and ''[[Futurama: Bender's Game|Bender's Game]]'' the ship passes through the screen's glass and temporarily becomes part of the environment depicted therein—a pastiche of [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]]'s ''[[Steamboat Willie]]'' and ''[[Yellow Submarine (film)|Yellow Submarine]]'' respectively—before crashing through the screen glass on the way out. In ''[[Futurama: Into the Wild Green Yonder|Into the Wild Green Yonder]]'', a completely different opening sequence involves a trip through a futuristic version of Las Vegas located on Mars. The theme tune is sung by [[Seth MacFarlane]] and is different from the standard theme tune. The end of the film incorporates a unique variation of the opening sequence; as the ''Planet Express Ship'' enters a wormhole, it converts into a pattern of lights similar to the lights that appear in the opening sequence.

The ''Futurama'' theme was created by [[Christopher Tyng]]. The theme is played on the [[tubular bells]] but is occasionally remixed for use in specific episodes, including a version by the [[Beastie Boys]] used for the episode "[[Hell Is Other Robots]]", in which they guest starred.<ref name="Azrai" /> The theme also samples a [[Amen break|drum break originating from "Amen, Brother"]] by American soul group [[The Winstons]]; however, the drum break is replaced in Season 6. A remixed rendition of the theme is used in Season 5, which features altered instruments and a lower pitch. Season 6 also uses this remix, but it has been reduced again in pitch and tempo.

===Language===
[[File:Alien decoder Futurama.svg|thumb|upright=1|Alien Language 1 and its equivalent [[Latin alphabet|Latin characters]]]]<!-- Needs 'point,up-arrow' for question mark-->
There are three alternative alphabets that appear often in the background of episodes, usually in the forms of [[graffiti]], advertisements, or warning labels. Nearly all messages using alternative scripts transliterate directly into English. The first alphabet consists of abstract characters and is referred to as Alienese,<ref name="LeelasHomeworld" /> a simple [[substitution cipher]] from the [[Latin alphabet]].<ref name="AlienAlphabet1">{{cite web|url=http://www.omniglot.com/writing/futurama.htm |title=Omniglot |accessdate=June 3, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120906081508/http://www.omniglot.com/writing/futurama.htm |archive-date=September 6, 2012 }}</ref> The second alphabet<!-- Commented out pending citation, we currently have no firm reference that the second alien language is in fact 'Beta Crypt III':, Beta Crypt III<ref name="LeelasHomeworld" /> --> uses a more complex [[modular arithmetic|modular]] addition code, where the "next letter is given by the summation of all previous letters plus the current letter".<ref name="TheDaytheEarthStoodStupid">{{cite episode| episode-link=The Day the Earth Stood Stupid| title=The Day the Earth Stood Stupid| series= Futurama| minutes=[[Audio commentary]] 11}}</ref> The codes often provide additional jokes for fans dedicated enough to decode the messages.<ref name="Cohen01" /> The third language sometimes used is [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]. Aside from these alphabets, most of the displayed wording on the show uses the Latin alphabet.

The show predicts that several English expressions will have evolved by the year 3000. For example, in the show the word ''Christmas'' has been replaced with ''Xmas'' (pronounced "''ex''-mas"), and the word ''[[wikt:ask|ask]]'' with ''aks'' (pronounced ''axe''). According to David X. Cohen, it is a running joke that the French language is [[extinct language|extinct]] in the ''Futurama'' universe (though the culture remains alive), much like [[Latin]] is in the present.<ref name="SpacePilot3000">{{cite episode |title=Space Pilot 3000 |episode-link=Space Pilot 3000 |series=Futurama |network=Fox Network |airdate=March 28, 1999 |season=1 |number=01 |minutes=[[Audio commentary]] 20}}</ref> In the French dubbing of the show, German is used as the extinct language instead.

===Humor===
Although the series uses a wide range of styles of humor, including [[self-deprecation]], [[black comedy]], [[off-color humor]], [[slapstick]], and [[Surreal humour|surreal humor]], its primary source of comedy is its [[Satire|satirical]] depiction of everyday life in the future and its [[parody|parodical]] comparisons to the present.<ref name="locus" /> Groening notes that, from the show's conception, his goal was to make what was, on the surface, a goofy comedy that would have underlying "legitimate literary science fiction concepts".<ref name="tvsquad">Keller, Joel (January 31, 2007).

The series developed a [[cult following]] partially due to the large number of [[in-joke]]s it contains, most of which are aimed at "[[nerd]]s".<ref name="locus"/> In [[Audio commentary|commentary]] on the DVD releases, David X.

Journalist/critic [[Frank Lovece]] in ''[[Newsday]]'' contrasted the humor tradition of Groening's two series, finding that {{quote|"''The Simpsons'' echoes the strains of [[Irish American|American-Irish]] [[vaudeville]] humor&nbsp;— the beer-soaked, sneaking-in-late-while-the-wife's-asleep comedy of [[Edward Harrigan|Harrigan and Hart]], McNulty and Murray, the [[Four Cohans]] (which, yes, included [[George M. Cohan|George M.]]) and countless others: knockabout yet sentimental, and ultimately about the bonds of blood family. ''Futurama'', conversely, stems from [[American Jews|Jewish-American]] humor, and not just in the obvious archetype of Dr. Zoidberg. From vaudeville to the [[Catskill Mountains|Catskills]] to [[Woody Allen]], it's that distinctly rueful humor built to ward away everything from despair to petty annoyance&nbsp;— the 'You gotta do what you gotta do' philosophy that helps the 'Futurama' characters cope in a mega-corporate world where the little guy is essentially powerless."<ref name=newsday />}} Animation maven [[Jerry Beck]] concurred: {{quote|"I'm Jewish, and I know what you're saying. Fry has that [type of humor], Dr. Zoidberg, all the [vocal artist] [[Billy West]] characters. I see it. The bottom line is, the producers are trying to make sure the shows are completely different entities."<ref name=newsday />}}

In an interview with Diego Molano, creator of ''[[Victor & Valentino]]'', in April 2019, he said that he found Futurama "incredibly influential," calling the humor smart but "not alienating."<ref name="MolanoAM">{{cite interview |last=Molano |first=Diego |interviewer=Animation Magazine staff |title=Animated People: Diego Molano, Creator of Cartoon Network’s ‘Victor and Valentino’ |url=https://www.animationmagazine.net/animated-people/animated-people-diego-molano-creator-of-cartoon-networks-victor-and-valentino/ |publisher=[[Animation Magazine]] |location=[[Calabasas, California]] |date=April 25, 2019 |access-date=September 25, 2020 |archive-date=April 26, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190426051956/https://www.animationmagazine.net/animated-people/animated-people-diego-molano-creator-of-cartoon-networks-victor-and-valentino/ }}</ref> He added that it makes him "feel smart" and adding that Groening's "sense of comedic timing is masterful."

==Cancelations, syndications and revivals==
===Fox cancelation===
Groening and Cohen wanted ''Futurama'' to be shown at 8:30&nbsp;pm on Sunday, following ''The Simpsons''.

===Success===
''Futurama'''s 7:00&nbsp;p.m. Sunday timeslot caused the show to often be pre-empted by sports and usually have a later than average season premiere. It also allowed the writers and animators to get ahead of the broadcast schedule so that episodes intended for one season were not aired until the following season. By the beginning of the fourth broadcast season, all the episodes to be aired that season had already been completed and writers were working at least a year in advance.<ref name="SciFiWeekly2">{{cite web |url=http://www.scifi.com/sfw/interviews/sfw7897.html |title=David X.

{{Main|Futurama Comics}}

First started in November 2000, ''Futurama Comics'' is a comic book series published by [[Bongo Comics Group|Bongo Comics]] based in the ''Futurama'' universe.<ref name="comics">{{cite news |url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=NewsLibrary&p_multi=CSGB&d_place=CSGB&p_theme=newslibrary2&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0F34B832C954DA1A&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM |title=Groening launches 'Futurama Comics' |date=November 19, 2000 |accessdate=July 16, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110609013008/http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=NewsLibrary&p_multi=CSGB&d_place=CSGB&p_theme=newslibrary2&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0F34B832C954DA1A&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM |archive-date=June 9, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> While originally published only in the US, a UK, German and Australian version of the series is also available.<ref>Press release (September 25, 2002) [http://www.gotfuturama.com/Information/Articles/titan.shtml Do you want Fry with that?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927172507/http://www.gotfuturama.com/Information/Articles/titan.shtml |date=September 27, 2007 }} ''Titan Publishing''. Retrieved from gotfuturama on March 4, 2007</ref> In addition, three issues were published in Norway. Other than a different running order and presentation, the stories are the same in all versions. While the comics focus on the same characters in the ''Futurama'' [[fictional universe]], the comics may not be [[canon (fiction)|canonical]] as the events portrayed within them do not necessarily have any effect upon the continuity of the show.

Like the TV series, each comic (except US comic #20) has a caption at the top of the cover. For example: "Made In The USA! (Printed in Canada)." Some of the UK and Australian comics have different captions on the top of their comics (for example, the Australian version of #20 says "A 21st Century Comic Book" across the cover, while the US version does not have a caption on that issue). All series contain a letters page, artwork from readers, and previews of other upcoming Bongo comics.

===Films===

When Comedy Central began negotiating for the rights to air ''Futurama'' reruns, Fox suggested that there was a possibility of also creating new episodes. Negotiations were already underway with the possibility of creating two or three [[Direct-to-video|straight-to-DVD]] films. When Comedy Central committed to sixteen new episodes, it was decided that four films would be produced.<ref name="Katz"/> On April 26, 2006, Groening noted in an interview that co-creator David X.
