The '''Highway Trust Fund''' is a transportation fund in the [[United States]] which receives money from a [[Gas tax#United States of America|federal fuel tax]] of 18.4 cents per gallon on gasoline and 24.4 cents per gallon of diesel fuel and related excise taxes.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.eia.gov/petroleum/marketing/monthly/pdf/enote.pdf |title = Petroleum Marketing Explanatory Notes |accessdate = March 2, 2016 |publisher = United States Energy Information Agency }}</ref> It currently has two accounts, the Highway Account which funds road construction and other surface transportation projects, and a smaller 'Mass Transit Account' which supports [[public transport|mass transit]].  Separate from the Highway Trust Fund is the 'Leaking Underground Storage Tank Trust Fund', which receives an additional 0.1 cents per gallon on gasoline and diesel, making the total amount of tax collected 18.5 cents per gallon on gasoline and 24.5 cents per gallon on diesel fuel. The Highway Trust Fund was established in 1956 to finance the United States [[Interstate Highway System]] and certain other roads. The Mass Transit Fund was created in 1982. The federal tax on motor fuels yielded $28.2 billion in 2006.<ref name = fueltaxcut>{{cite news |last = Broder |first = John M. |url = https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/29/us/politics/29campaign.html?partner=rssuserland&emc=rss&pagewanted=all |title = Democrats Divided Over Gas Tax Break |work = The New York Times |date = April 29, 2008 |accessdate = May 1, 2008 }}</ref>

==History==
Prior to the [[Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956]] and the establishment of the Highway Trust Fund, roads were financed directly from the General Fund of the [[United States Department of the Treasury]]. The 1956 Act directed [[Gas tax#United States of America|federal fuel tax]] to the fund to be used exclusively for highway construction and maintenance. The Highway Revenue Act mandated a tax of three cents per gallon. The original Highway Revenue Act was set to expire at the end of fiscal year 1972. In the 1950s the gas tax was increased to four cents. The 1982 [[Surface Transportation Assistance Act]], approved by President [[Ronald Reagan]] in January 1983, increased the tax to nine cents with one cent going into a new Mass Transit Account to support [[public transport]]. In 1990 the gas tax was increased by President George H. W. Bush with the [[Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990]] to 14 cents—with 2.5 cents of the increase going to the Highway Fund and the other 2.5 cents going towards deficit reduction. In 1993 President Clinton increased the gas tax to 18.4 cents with the [[Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993]] with all of the increase going towards deficit reduction. The [[Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997]] redirected the 1993 increase to the Fund.<ref>[http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/infrastructure/gastax.cfm When did the Federal Government begin collecting the gas tax?]</ref>

During 2008 the fund required support of $8 billion from general revenue funds to cover a shortage in the fund. This shortage was due to lower gas consumption as a result of the recession and higher gas prices.<ref>{{cite news |url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/09/05/AR2008090503525.html |work = The Washington Post |title = Highway Trust Fund Is Nearly Out of Gas |first = Eric M. |last = Weiss |date = September 6, 2008 |accessdate = May 4, 2010 }}</ref> Further transfers of $7 billion and $19.5 billion were made in 2009 and 2010 respectively.<ref>{{cite news |url = http://www.aashtojournal.org/Pages/031910reauthorization.aspx |work = The Washington Post |title = President Signs Bill Providing 9-Month Extension, $19.5 Billion for Highway Trust Fund |date = March 19, 2010 |accessdate = August 15, 2011 }}</ref>

During the 2008 presidential campaign, Senator [[John McCain]] proposed a 'gas holiday', a suspension in the tax during the peak summer driving season. Senator [[Hillary Clinton]] endorsed this idea soon afterwards while Senator [[Barack Obama]] opposed the suspension. Clinton proposed a 'windfall tax' on oil companies, which would make up for the lost revenue from the federal tax on gasoline and diesel fuel without affecting any projects.<ref name = fueltaxcut />

Since 2000, there have been at least half a dozen attempts by individual members of Congress to suspend the federal gas tax, which raises money to repair and expand the highway system. All attempts have failed.<ref>{{cite news |last = Power |first = Stephen |url = https://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2008/04/15/mccains-gas-tax-plan-may-be-a-clunker/?mod=WSJBlog |title = McCain’s Gas-Tax Plan May Be a Clunker |work = The Wall Street Journal |department = Washington Wire |date = April 15, 2008 |accessdate = April 16, 2008 }}</ref>

==Solvency issues==
From 2008 to 2010, Congress authorized the transfer of $35 billion from the General Fund of the U.S. Treasury to keep the trust fund solvent.<ref name=Governing>{{cite news |last = Holeywell |first = Ryan |title = CBO: Highway Trust Fund Account Goes Broke in 2013 |work = Governing |date = January 31, 2012 }}</ref>

The [[Congressional Budget Office]] (CBO) projected in 2012 that the fund's Highway Account and Mass Transit Account would become insolvent by 2014. CBO said that although vehicles would travel more miles in the future (therefore consuming more taxable fuel), congressional refusal to increase the fuel tax means that the fund receives less money. CBO's insolvency projection assumed that Congress will not increase transportation spending beyond inflation-adjusted 2012 levels.<ref name=Governing />

As of June 2015, the Congressional Budget Office projected that payments from the Highway Trust Fund to the states would need to be delayed at some point before the end of federal fiscal year 2015 (i.e., before the end of September 2015) to keep the balance above zero, without either some increase in the federal motor fuel excise tax (or allocation of other revenues  to the Trust Fund) or a Congressional reduction of Trust Fund spending commitments.<ref>{{cite web |last1 = Kile |first1 = Joseph |title = Testimony on the Status of the Highway Trust Fund |url = https://www.cbo.gov/publication/50297 |publisher = Congressional Budget Office |accessdate = October 17, 2015 }}</ref>

In 2013, the [[U.S. Chamber of Commerce]] supported raising the federal gasoline tax to keep the fund solvent.<ref>{{cite news |url = http://go.bloomberg.com/political-capital/2013-02-12/u-s-role-in-highways-questioned-answered/ |last = Kohn |first = Bernie |title = U.S. Role in Highways Questioned, Answered |work = Bloomberg Business News |date = February 12, 2013 |access-date = March 7, 2013 }}</ref>

The [[United States Congress]] passed a stopgap plan on July 31, 2014 to prevent a funding lapse.<ref>{{cite news |last1 = Memoli |first1 = Michael |title = Congress approves temporary highway funding measure |url = http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/la-na-congress-highway-20140731-story.html |work = Los Angeles Times |accessdate = August 3, 2014 }}</ref>

As of 2015, despite a considerable drop in gas prices, there was still little support among the US public or Congress for an increase of the gasoline excise tax.<ref name=NTY010215>{{cite news |first = Patricia |last = Cohen |title = Gasoline-Tax Increase Finds Little Support |url = https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/03/business/energy-environment/support-for-gas-tax-increase-still-nil-despite-falling-prices.html |accessdate = January 3, 2015 |work = The New York Times |date = January 2, 2015 }}</ref>
