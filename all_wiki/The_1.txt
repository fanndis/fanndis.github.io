"'''The 1'''" (stylized in [[Letter case#All lowercase|all lowercase]]) is a song recorded by American singer-songwriter [[Taylor Swift]], for her eighth studio album, ''[[Folklore (Taylor Swift album)|Folklore]]'', which was released on July 24, 2020, through [[Republic Records]]. On October 9, 2020, the song was made a single to German [[contemporary hit radio]]. As the opening track of the album, the song was written by Swift and [[Aaron Dessner]], with production from the latter. "The 1" is a bouncy, [[Minimal music|minimal]] tune with [[Electronic music|electronic]]-infused, [[Indie pop|indie-pop]] instrumentals exuding slow [[Dance music|danceability]]. Written from the perspective of one of Swift's friends, the song describes the narrator's newborn positive approach to life and past romance, in a sad but [[Humour|humorous]] tone, using numerous [[One liners|one-liners]]. Upon release, "The 1" received positive reviews from [[music critics]], who commended its stripped-back nature and witty lyricism. 

The song debuted at number one on the United States [[Spotify]] chart with 4.175&nbsp;million streams, becoming the biggest song debut by a female artist in the platform's history, and the second biggest of 2020 globally with 7.420 million streams, only behind "[[Cardigan (song)|Cardigan]]"—the lead single of ''Folklore''. On the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], "The 1" arrived at number four, constituting Swift's record-extending 28 top-10 hits and 18 top-10 debuts in the US; accompanied by "Cardigan" at number one and "[[Exile (Taylor Swift song)|Exile]]" at number six in the same week, Swift became the first ever act in history to debut two songs in the top four and three songs in the top six, simultaneously. "The 1" proceeded to become the highest-peaking and longest-charting non-single in Hot 100 history. Elsewhere, the song reached top-tier positions, opening inside the top-five in Australia, Malaysia and Singapore, and the top-ten in Canada, Ireland, New Zealand and the United Kingdom.

== Background and release ==
[[File:Adessner.jpg|thumb|"The 1" was produced by [[Aaron Dessner]] (left) of [[the National (band)|the National]], while the song's orchestration was provided by his twin brother and bandmate [[Bryce Dessner]] (right).|250x250px|alt=]]

In a ''[[Vulture magazine|Vulture]]'' interview, [[Aaron Dessner]] revealed that "The 1" was one of the two last songs Swift had written for ''Folklore'', the other being "Hoax"; the tracks were described as [[bookend]]s of the project by her. The singer went through the files that Dessner had sent to her and wrote the song to one of the compositions, in a couple of hours in the middle of the night. Dessner worked on the music for the voice memo Swift sent back, tracked her vocals, and sent it to [[Bryce Dessner]] in France, who added the [[orchestra]]tion to the song. Swift described the song as "bookends" to ''Folklore'', along with "Hoax", the final track on the album.<ref name=":1" />

On July 23, 2020, Swift revealed the track listing of ''Folklore'', where "The 1" placed first, and released the album on July 24, 2020. "The 1" was sent to German [[contemporary hit radio]] stations as a single on October 9, 2020.<ref name="Universal">{{cite web|date=October 9, 2020|title="the 1" – Taylor Swift veröffentlicht neue Single aus Rekord-Album "folklore"|url=https://www.universal-music.de/taylorswift|accessdate=October 9, 2020|website=Universal Music|language=de}}</ref>
