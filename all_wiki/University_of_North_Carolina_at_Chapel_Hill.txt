The first public institution of higher education in North Carolina, the school opened its doors to students on February 12, 1795.

During the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], [[Governor of North Carolina|North Carolina Governor]] [[David Lowry Swain]] persuaded [[President of the Confederate States of America|Confederate President]] [[Jefferson Davis]] to exempt some students from the draft, so the university was one of the few in the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] that managed to stay open.<ref>Snider, William D. (1992), p. 67.</ref> However, [[Chapel Hill, North Carolina|Chapel Hill]] suffered the loss of more of its population during the war than any village in the South,{{citation needed|date=October 2020}} and when student numbers did not recover, the university was forced to close during [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]] from December 1, 1870 until September 6, 1875.<ref>{{cite book|last=Battle|first=Kemp P.|title=History of the University of North Carolina: From 1868–1912|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AdshAAAAMAAJ|publisher=Edwards & Broughton Printing Company|location=Raleigh, NC|year=1912|pages=39, 41, 88}}</ref> Following the reopening, enrollment was slow to increase and university administrators offered free tuition for the sons of teachers and ministers, as well as loans for those who could not afford attendance.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Holden|first=Charles|date=February 2018|title=Manliness and the Culture of Self-Improvement: The University of North Carolina in the 1890s–1900s|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/product/identifier/S0018268017000516/type/journal_article|journal=History of Education Quarterly|language=en|volume=58|issue=1|pages=122–151|doi=10.1017/heq.2017.51|issn=0018-2680}}</ref>

Despite initial skepticism from university President [[Frank Porter Graham]], on March 27, 1931, legislation was passed to group the University of North Carolina with the [[North Carolina State University|State College of Agriculture and Engineering]] and [[University of North Carolina at Greensboro|Woman's College of the University of North Carolina]] to form the Consolidated University of North Carolina.<ref>Snider, William D. (1992), pp. 212–213.</ref> In 1963, the consolidated university was made fully [[coeducational]], although most women still attended Woman's College for their first two years, transferring to Chapel Hill as juniors, since freshmen were required to live on campus and there was only one women's residence hall. As a result, Woman's College was renamed the "[[University of North Carolina at Greensboro]]", and the University of North Carolina became the "University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill."<ref>{{cite news|title=UNC Trustees in broad changes of all branches|date=January 25, 1963|location=Burlington, NC|work=The Daily Times-News|page=1}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Frost|first1=Susan H.|last2=Hearn|first2=James C.|last3=Marine|first3=Ginger M.|year=1997|title=State Policy and the Public Research University: A Case Study of Manifest and Latent Tensions|journal=The Journal of Higher Education|publisher=The Ohio State University Press|location=Columbus, OH|volume=68|issue=4|pages=363–397|doi=10.2307/2960008|jstor=2960008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uncg.edu/campus_links/inside_uncg/inside_history.html|title=The History of UNCG|year=2005|publisher=The University of North Carolina at Greensboro|access-date=May 20, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070804213527/http://www.uncg.edu/campus_links/inside_uncg/inside_history.html|archive-date=August 4, 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref> In 1955, UNC officially desegregated its undergraduate divisions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lib.unc.edu/ncc/ref/unc/uncdesegregation.html|title=North Carolina Collection-UNC Desegregation|publisher=Lib.unc.edu|access-date=July 10, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130119032534/http://www.lib.unc.edu/ncc/ref/unc/uncdesegregation.html|archive-date=January 19, 2013|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

During the 1960s, the campus was the location of significant political protest. Prior to the passage of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]], protests about local [[racial segregation]] which began quietly in [[Franklin Street (Chapel Hill)|Franklin Street]] restaurants led to mass demonstrations and disturbance.<ref>Snider, William D. (1992), p. 269.</ref> The climate of civil unrest prompted the 1963 [[North Carolina Speaker Ban|Speaker Ban Law]] prohibiting speeches by communists on state campuses in North Carolina.<ref>Snider, William D.

(1992), pp. 272–273.</ref> Small amendments to allow "infrequent" visits failed to placate the student body, especially when the university's board of trustees overruled new Chancellor Paul Frederick Sharp's decision to allow speaking invitations to [[Marxist]] speaker [[Herbert Aptheker]] and civil liberties activist [[Frank Wilkinson]]; however, the two speakers came to Chapel Hill anyway. Wilkinson spoke off campus, while more than 1,500 students viewed Aptheker's speech across a low campus wall at the edge of campus, christened "Dan Moore's Wall" by ''[[The Daily Tar Heel]]'' for Governor [[Dan K. Moore]].<ref>Snider, William D. (1992), pp. 274–275.</ref> A group of UNC-Chapel Hill students, led by Student Body President Paul Dickson, filed a lawsuit in [[United States federal courts|U.S. federal court]], and on February 20, 1968, the Speaker Ban Law was struck down.<ref>Snider, William D. (1992), pp. 267–268.</ref> In 1969, campus food workers of Lenoir Hall went on [[UNC Food Worker Strike|strike]] protesting perceived racial injustices that impacted their employment, garnering the support of student groups and members of the University and Chapel Hill community.

From the late 1990s and onward, UNC-Chapel Hill expanded rapidly with a 15% increase in total student population to more than 28,000 by 2007.

===McCorkle Place and Old Well===
[[File:Old Well UNC.jpg|thumb|Students walk past the [[Old Well]], a symbol of UNC-Chapel Hill for years]]
McCorkle Place, a green square on campus of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, North Carolina, commemorates [[Samuel Eusebius McCorkle]], the inceptor and progenitor of the university.

The most enduring symbol of the university is the [[Old Well]], a small neoclassical [[rotunda (architecture)|rotunda]] based on the Temple of Love in the [[Gardens of Versailles]], in the same location as the original well that provided water for the school.<ref name="landmarks">{{cite web|url=http://museum.unc.edu/exhibits/architecture/the-temple-of-love-versailles-1775-left-and-the-ol/|title=Architectural Highlights of Carolina's Historic Campus|access-date=September 11, 2010|publisher=The Carolina Story|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100610011548/http://museum.unc.edu/exhibits/architecture/the-temple-of-love-versailles-1775-left-and-the-ol/|archive-date=June 10, 2010|url-status=live}}</ref> The well stands at the south end of McCorkle Place, the northern quad, between two of the campus's oldest buildings, [[Old East]], and Old West.

The historic [[Playmakers Theatre]] is located on Cameron Avenue between McCorkle Place and Polk Place.

===Undergraduate admissions===
UNC-Chapel Hill's admissions process is "most selective" according to ''[[U.S. News & World Report]]''.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/unc-2974 |title=University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill |magazine=U.S. News & World Report |access-date=September 22, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150907180723/http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/unc-2974 |archive-date=September 7, 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref> State law requires that the percentage of in-state students per freshman class be at least 82%, making out-of-state admissions particularly selective. For freshmen entering Fall 2019, 9,610 were accepted out of 44,859 applicants, a 21% acceptance rate, and 4,183 enrolled.<ref name="CP">{{cite web|title=National Center for Education Statistics|url=https://nces.ed.gov/collegenavigator/?id=199120#general|website=National Center for Education Statistics|publisher=NCES}}</ref>  Women constituted 61% of the incoming class; men 39%.<ref name=CP/>

===Department of Public Policy===
The UNC-Chapel Hill Department of Public Policy, established in 2001, is a [[public policy]] program offering specializations in areas such as global [[Health care in the United States|health policy]], [[Education in the United States|education policy]], [[Taxation in the United States|tax policy]], and [[Social Justice|social justice]].

Established in 1979, the Curriculum in Public Policy Analysis was one of the first undergraduate degree programs in public policy, and a charter member of the national Association for Public Policy Analysis and Management. It was augmented in 1991 by an interdisciplinary PhD Curriculum in Public Policy Analysis. In 1995 the two curricula were combined and began recruiting their own core faculty. In 2001 the combined curriculum became the present Department of Public Policy.

===Honor Code===

The university has a longstanding [[Honor Code]] known as the "Instrument of Student Judicial Governance," supplemented by an entirely student-run Honor System to resolve issues with students accused of academic and conduct offenses against the university community.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://honor.unc.edu/|title=The Honor Code|publisher=Honor Court of The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|access-date=April 14, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090518014711/http://honor.unc.edu/|archive-date=May 18, 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref> The Honor System is divided into three branches: the Student Attorney General Staff, the Honor Court, and the Honor System Outreach. The Student Attorney General is appointed by the Student Body President to investigate all reports of Honor Code violations and determine whether or not to bring charges against the student as detailed in the "Instrument."  The Attorney General is supported by a select staff of around 40 students. The Honor Court is led by the Chair, who is appointed by the Student Body President, and supported by Vice Chairs who adjudicate all students' hearings. The Honor Court as a whole is made up of some 80 selected students. The Honor System Outreach is a branch of the System solely devoted to promoting honor and integrity in the university community. UNC-Chapel Hill is the only public university, with the exception of the military academies, that has a completely student-run system from the beginning to the end of the process.

===The Carolina Way===
Basketball coach [[Dean Smith]] was widely known for his idea of "The Carolina Way", in which he challenged his players to, "Play hard, play smart, play together."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/carolina-way-dean-wesley-smith/1101967410?ean=9780143034643|title=The Carolina Way: Leadership Lessons from a Life in Coaching|date=May 22, 2014|work=Barnes & Noble|access-date=June 29, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150630080623/http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/carolina-way-dean-wesley-smith/1101967410?ean=9780143034643|archive-date=June 30, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> "The Carolina Way" was an idea of excellence in the classroom, as well as on the court. In Coach Smith's book, ''The Carolina Way'', former player Scott Williams said, regarding Dean Smith, "Winning was very important at Carolina, and there was much pressure to win, but Coach cared more about our getting a sound education and turning into good citizens than he did about winning."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.championshipcoachesnetwork.com/public/315.cfm|title=10 Leadership Lessons from Coach Dean Smith|access-date=June 28, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150622155416/http://www.championshipcoachesnetwork.com/public/315.cfm|archive-date=June 22, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Rivalries===
{{main|Carolina–Duke rivalry|North Carolina–NC State rivalry|South's Oldest Rivalry}}

The [[South's Oldest Rivalry]] between North Carolina and its first opponent, the [[University of Virginia]], was prominent throughout the first third of the twentieth century.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.1122productions.com/rivalries/most-played.html|title=Most-Played Rivalries|access-date=April 14, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090220070515/http://1122productions.com/rivalries/most-played.html|archive-date=February 20, 2009|url-status=live}}</ref> The 119th meeting in [[college football|football]] between two of the top public universities in [[East Coast of the United States|the east]] occurred in October 2014.<ref>''[[U.S. News & World Report]]'' has ranked UC Berkeley, UVA, UCLA, Michigan, and UNC-Chapel Hill as the top five public universities in America for at least nine consecutive years as of 2014.</ref>

One of the fiercest rivalries is with Durham's [[Duke University]]. Located only eight miles from each other, the schools regularly compete in both athletics and academics. The [[Carolina-Duke rivalry]] is most intense, however, in [[college basketball|basketball]].<ref name="hbo">{{cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2008/writers/richard_deitsch/06/22/media.623/index.html|title=HBO probes Carolina-Duke rivalry|last=Deitsch|first=Richard|work=Media Circus|publisher=SI.com|access-date=June 24, 2008|date=June 23, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080627065723/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2008/writers/richard_deitsch/06/22/media.623/index.html|archive-date=June 27, 2008|url-status=live}}</ref> With a combined eleven national championships in men's basketball, both teams have been frequent contenders for the national championship for the past thirty years. The rivalry has been the focus of several books, including Will Blythe's ''To Hate Like This Is to Be Happy Forever'' and was the focus of the HBO documentary ''Battle for Tobacco Road: Duke vs Carolina''.<ref>{{cite web|title=HBO.com|url=http://www.hbo.com/sports/battle-for-tobacco-road-duke-vs-carolina/index.html|access-date=November 14, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120211001634/http://www.hbo.com/sports/battle-for-tobacco-road-duke-vs-carolina/index.html|archive-date=February 11, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>  Duke was Carolina's biggest rival from the 1930s until the early 1960s, when Duke's declining athletic program shifted Carolina's rival focus to North Carolina State.

Carolina holds an in-state rivalry with fellow Tobacco Road school, [[North Carolina State University]]. Since the mid-1970s, however, the Tar Heels have shifted their attention to Duke following a severe decline in NC State's basketball program (and the resurgence of Duke's basketball program) that reached rock bottom during Roy Williams' tenure as evidenced by their 4-36 record against the Tar Heels. The Wolfpack faithful still consider the rivalry the most bitter in the state despite the fact that it's been decades since Tar Heel supporters have acknowledged NC State as a rival. Combined, the two schools hold eight NCAA Championships and 27 ACC Championships in basketball. Students from each school often exchange pranks before basketball and football games.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://media.www.technicianonline.com/media/storage/paper848/news/2006/11/16/News/Ram-Roast.Deters.Tar.Heel.Blue.Tunnel-2463417.shtml|title=Ram Roast deters Tar Heel blue tunnel|last=Blakely|first=Kyle|date=November 16, 2006|location=Raleigh, NC|work=Technician|access-date=June 28, 2008}}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url= http://media.www.dailytarheel.com/media/storage/paper885/news/2008/02/21/University/Campus.Awakes.To.A.Red.Old.Well-3224421.shtml|title= Campus awakes to a red Old Well|last= Tovar|first= Sergio|date= February 21, 2008|location= Chapel Hill, NC|work= The Daily Tar Heel|access-date=May 18, 2008|url-status=dead|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080527222925/http://media.www.dailytarheel.com/media/storage/paper885/news/2008/02/21/University/Campus.Awakes.To.A.Red.Old.Well-3224421.shtml|archive-date= May 27, 2008|df= mdy-all}}</ref>

[[File:2008-07-21 Lenoir Hall.jpg|thumb|Lenoir Hall]]
Lenoir Dining Hall was completed in 1939 using funds from the New Deal Public Works Administration, and opened for service to students when they returned from Christmas holidays in January 1940. The building was named for [[William Lenoir (general)|General William Lenoir]], the first chairman of the Board of Trustees of the University in 1790. Since its inception, Lenoir Dining Hall has remained the flagship of Carolina Dining Services and the center of dining on campus. It has been renovated twice, in 1984 and 2011, to improve seating and ease mealtime rushes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://unchistory.web.unc.edu/building-narratives/lenoir-dining-hall/ |title=Lenoir Dining Hall |access-date=September 1, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180213145201/http://unchistory.web.unc.edu/building-narratives/lenoir-dining-hall/ |archive-date=February 13, 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Chase Hall was originally built in 1965 to offer South Campus dining options and honor former UNC President Harry Woodburn Chase, who served from 1919 to 1930. In 2005, the building was torn down to make way for the Student and Academic Services buildings, and was rebuilt north of the original location as the Rams Head Center (with the inner dining hall officially titled Chase Dining Hall). Due to students nicknaming the dining hall Rams Head, the University officially reinstated Chase Hall as the building name in March 2017. It includes the Chase Dining Hall, the Rams Head Market, and a conference room called the "Blue Zone".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://enterprises.unc.edu/news/2017/09/14/chase-dining-hall-history/ |title=Chase Dining Hall: A History |access-date=September 1, 2018 |archive-date=September 30, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200930141923/https://aux-services.unc.edu/news/2017/09/14/chase-dining-hall-history/ |url-status=live }}</ref> Chase Dining Hall seats 1,300 people and has a capacity for serving 10,000 meals per day.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fac.unc.edu/FacilityInfo/index.asp |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030426064425/http://www.fac.unc.edu/FacilityInfo/index.asp |url-status=dead |archive-date=April 26, 2003 |title=Facility Information }}</ref> It continues to offer more food service options to the students living on south campus, and features extended hours including the 9&nbsp;pm&nbsp;– 12&nbsp;am period referred to as "Late Night".<ref>Boss, Donna.
