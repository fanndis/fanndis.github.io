'''Linda Perry''' (born April 15, 1965)<ref name=allmusic>{{cite web | url = http://www.allmusic.com/artist/linda-perry-mn0000285294/biography | title= Artist Biography [Linda Perry] | first=Jason | last=Anderson | publisher= [[AllMusic.com]] | access-date= March 31, 2014}}</ref> is an American singer-songwriter, musician, and record producer. She was the lead singer and primary songwriter of [[4 Non Blondes]], and has since founded two record labels and composed and produced hit songs for several other artists.  They include: "[[Beautiful (Christina Aguilera song)|Beautiful]]" by [[Christina Aguilera]]; "[[What You Waiting For?]]" by [[Gwen Stefani]]; and "[[Get the Party Started]]" by [[P!nk]]. Perry has also contributed to albums by [[Adele]], [[Alicia Keys]], and [[Courtney Love]], as well as signing and distributing [[James Blunt]]<ref name="hitquarters.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview/opar/intrview_LindaPerry.html|title=Linda Perry interview|publisher=[[HitQuarters]]|access-date=January 5, 2006}}</ref> in the United States. Perry was also inducted into the [[Songwriters Hall of Fame]] in 2015.

==Early life==
In 1965, Perry was born in [[Springfield, Massachusetts]].<ref name=allmusic /> <!--the daughter of the late [[Portuguese-American]] Alfred Xavier Perry (1928-2005), an engineer and a musician, and [[Brazil]]ian-born Marluce Perry. Her mother has worked as a model, designer, and private detective. Linda has six siblings: five brothers (Jay, Solomon, Mark, Marcel, and John) and a sister (Sally).--> Growing up in an artistic and musical household, Perry displayed musical talent and interest from an early age. Despite struggling with kidney disease and then drug addiction, she still focused on music.<ref name=allmusic /> Her mother is [[Brazilian Americans|Brazilian]] (Marluce Martins Perry) and her father was [[Portuguese Americans|Portuguese-American]] (Alfred Xavier Perry).

==Career==

===1987–89: Early career===
In early 1986, at the age of 21, Perry moved to San Francisco. As a teenager in [[San Diego]], she had pursued an interest in music, playing the [[guitar]] and auditioning for all-girl cover bands. Her arrival in San Francisco would mark the beginning of a career in music, though not before waiting tables, working coat-check, and working at a pizzeria.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} In San Francisco, Perry lived in a small, windowless room, and would play her guitar and sing her own songs on city streets.

===1989–95: 4 Non Blondes===
After some time spent performing solo at [[San Francisco Bay Area|Bay Area]] clubs and coffeehouses, Perry composed her first professional song, called "Down On Your Face," and was recruited into the band [[4 Non Blondes]] by its founder [[Christa Hillhouse]] in the middle of 1989. After several years of playing locally and negotiating with various [[record companies]], the band finally signed with [[Interscope Records]] and released its debut album, ''[[Bigger, Better, Faster, More!]]'' on October 9, 1992. The album, featuring Perry as lead singer and dominated by her compositions, was an immediate success and spawned a hit single, the Perry-penned "[[What's Up? (4 Non Blondes song)|What's Up?]]" (often erroneously called "What's Going On?" after its prominent chorus lyric).

<!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[File:4 Non Blondes (21).jpg|thumb|left|Linda Perry (right) with her band 4 Non Blondes]] -->
In February 1994, Perry had a solo appearance in [[Roger Daltrey]]'s production, album and video ''[[A Celebration: The Music of Pete Townshend and The Who]]''. She shared the stage with the [[Juilliard]] Orchestra and members of [[The Who]] as she sang "[[Doctor Jimmy]]", "[[Acid Queen]]", "[[I'm Free (The Who song)|I'm Free]]" (in a duet with Roger Daltrey), and the encore for "[[Join Together (song)|Join Together]]" with original The Who members [[John Entwistle]] and [[Pete Townshend]]. In 1994, a CD and a VHS video of the shows were issued with the songs "Doctor Jimmy" and "I'm Free", while in 1998 a DVD was released with the song "I'm Free" only.

In June 1994, 4 Non Blondes guitarist [[Roger Rocha]] was replaced by [[Concrete Blonde]] member [[Jim Mankey]], who had just played for [[Van Halen]]'s cover "[[Van Halen (album)|I'm the One]]" recorded as the theme from the movie ''[[Airheads]]''. During sessions at [[Interscope]] studios in Los Angeles, the band struggled to come up with a followup to ''Bigger'', and Perry left the band during the attempt to pursue a solo career. The band recorded one last video, for a cover of [[Led Zeppelin]]'s "[[Misty Mountain Hop]]" with [[Dave Navarro]] on guitar.

In a 2011 ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' interview, while promoting her most recent band, [[Deep Dark Robot]], Perry was quoted saying, "I wasn't really a big fan of my band" due to the "fluffy polished bullshit" sound of ''Bigger, Better, Faster, More!''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/linda-perry-forms-new-band-admits-she-never-liked-4-non-blondes-20110330|title=Linda Perry Forms New Band, Admits She Never Liked 4 Non Blondes|work=Rolling Stone|access-date=June 10, 2015|date=March 30, 2011}}</ref>

===1996–2010: Solo career===
{{BLP unsourced section|date=December 2011}}
[[Image:Linda Perry.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Linda Perry in May 2008]]
With the band in disarray and the recording contract unfulfilled, Interscope reluctantly allowed Perry to make a solo CD, dropping the rest of the band. Interscope insisted on choosing the album's producer; the production team selected was [[Bill Bottrell]] and members of the ''[[Tuesday Night Music Club]]'', who had recently produced [[Sheryl Crow]]'s debut. Released in 1996, ''[[In Flight (Linda Perry album)|In Flight]]'' was moody, mellow and, at times, dark, far removed from the 4 Non Blondes sound.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} The release received positive notices, but was a poor seller. Perry joined Red Fish, Blue Fish for her world tour, supporting such acts as The Who.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} She promoted her CD with her own funds, including an appearance on ''[[The Howard Stern Show]]'', during which she participated in "[[lesbian]] dial-a-date" and performed her former band's only hit single, "What's Up?" Perry also hosted the 1997 and 1998 Bammies ([[Bay Area Music Awards]]).

In 1997, Perry produced a film, ''[[:fr:Pink as the Day She Was Born|Pink as the Day She Was Born]]'', featuring cameos by [[Les Claypool]] of [[Primus (band)|Primus]] and comedian [[Margaret Cho]]. She also launched her own record label, Rockstar Records, for the primary purpose of releasing a CD of band Stone Fox. In addition, she signed another local San Francisco band, 2 Lane Blacktop. The year 1998 saw Perry appearing and performing on [[CNN]] as part of a special on music and the [[Internet]]—how independent artists are cutting out the major labels. In 1999, she released her second solo album on Rockstar Records, ''After Hours''. For the rest of 1999, she opened for [[Bryan Adams]], reuniting with 4 Non Blondes' bassist Christa Hillhouse, then toured behind ''After Hours'', with Hillhouse and San Francisco-based drummer Claudia Page.

In 2001, Perry again returned to music and touring. She wrote a handful of songs, two of which, "Beautiful" and "Cruz," would eventually be recorded and appear on Christina Aguilera's hit album ''[[Stripped (2002 album)|Stripped]]''. In 2001, she closed most of her shows with "Beautiful," a song she hoped would be her own comeback hit.

In 2002, Perry made a rare live performance at the [[Knitting Factory]] in Los Angeles, where she performed a set of original music and a set of Led Zeppelin covers. Also in 2002, she made an appearance on a solo record of [[Gordon Gano]], ''[[Hitting the Ground]]'', performing the song "So It Goes."

Perry made a live appearance at a [[DKNY]] benefit show in Los Angeles, where she joined [[Slash (musician)|Slash]] on stage for a version of Led Zeppelin's "[[Whole Lotta Love]]."

In 2005, Perry was a performer at ASCAP's showcase at the [[Sundance Film Festival]]. In August 2006, she played piano on Christina Aguilera's performance of "Hurt" at the MTV Video Music Awards.

Perry has signed with the independent label [[Kill Rock Stars|Kill Rock Stars Records]], who re-released her solo album ''In Flight'' in October 2005. Featuring new artwork, the re-release includes original videos for "Fill Me Up" and "Freeway". In 2008, Perry played guitar in the video for Christina Aguilera's "Save Me From Myself." Perry made a live appearance at "Hope For Haiti Now" playing piano while Aguilera premiered a stripped-down version of their song "Lift Me Up." She also made guest appearances on Hole's "Nobody's Daughter" tour and on a concert of the Perry-signed band [[Little Fish (band)|Little Fish]] in London. In May 2010, Perry again hosted the "Evening with Women" at L.A.'s Gay and Lesbian Centre, where she reunited with P!nk for a live duet of Perry's song "What's Up?" Christina Aguilera invited Perry to her VH1 Storytellers concert in May 2010. Perry played piano to Aguilera's "Beautiful" and talked about the song.

On November 5, 2010, Perry appeared live in San Francisco with 4 Non Blondes guitar player Roger Rocha at TwentyFifty (formerly CELLSpace). The appearance celebrated the release of Rocha's album with his band The Golden Hearts. It was the first time in 20 years the two had appeared together live. Perry performed a solo set of cover tunes, including [[Radiohead]]'s "[[Creep (Radiohead song)|Creep]]" and [[Soundgarden|Soundgarden's]] "[[Black Hole Sun]]." Perry and Roger Rocha performed one song together, Led Zeppelin's "[[Since I've Been Loving You]]."<ref>Chad Tasky, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFbYCzs_6j0 video footage posted on YouTube], recorded November 5, 2010 at Cell Space in San Francisco.</ref>

===2001–2010: Production and songwriting===
In 2000, Perry was contacted by pop rock singer [[P!nk|Pink]], seeking production and songwriting assistance on her second album. Perry commented on the experience in an interview with [[HitQuarters]]: "She was this white girl singing R&B music, and it made absolutely no sense to me why she would call me. So when I got together with her my instinct said, 'Don’t go and be an artist again, don’t get another record deal, find out what you can do with her.' My manager freaked out when I called her and said, cancel all the showcases!"<ref name="hitquarters.com"/> Perry co-wrote and produced much of Pink's successful album ''[[Missundaztood]]'', which brought Perry back into the spotlight as a music producer. Perry took full writing credits for the songs "Get the Party Started" and "Lonely Girl." Perry next provided [[Christina Aguilera]] the hit "[[Beautiful (Christina Aguilera song)|Beautiful]]."

Since then, she has gone on to work with many artists, including [[Jewel (singer)|Jewel]], [[Courtney Love]], [[Gwen Stefani]], [[Alicia Keys]], [[Celine Dion]], [[Blaque]], [[Sugababes]], [[Lillix]], [[Robbie Williams]], [[Melissa Etheridge]], [[Sierra Swan]], [[Solange Knowles]], [[Gavin Rossdale]], [[Juliette and the Licks]], [[Lisa Marie Presley]], [[Fischerspooner]], [[Unwritten Law]], [[L.P. (singer)|L.P.]], [[Kelly Osbourne]], [[James Blunt]], [[Cheap Trick]], [[Ben Jelen]], [[Enrique Iglesias]] and [[Giusy Ferreri]].

The 2002 [[Faith Hill]] album ''[[Cry (Faith Hill album)|Cry]]'' has a song co-written by Perry and Alecia B. Moore ([[P!nk|Pink]]).

In 2003, Perry won two [[ASCAP]] awards for her songwriting, and a [[Grammy Awards]] nomination for her song "Beautiful" as a contender for "Song of the Year"; the song received the award for [[Best Female Pop Vocal Performance]] at the [[2004 Grammy Awards]].

With actress [[Gina Gershon]], she wrote the song "StupidStar" for the movie ''[[Prey for Rock and Roll]].'' With [[Brooklyn]] rocker [[L.P. (singer)|L.P.]], she co-wrote "[[Suburban Sprawl & Alcohol|The Darkside]]."

For most of 2004, Perry remained behind the scenes, making another appearance with Camp Freddy, this time at Los Angeles' Live 103's Birthday Concert. She joined Lisa Marie Presley on stage for songs they wrote together. The year 2004 also saw the release of Courtney Love's solo ''[[America's Sweetheart (album)|America's Sweetheart]]'', to which Perry heavily contributed.

A song called "Girls & Boys", which was originally intended for Pink but later recorded by [[Britney Spears]], was released as a bonus track on Spears' European DVD release. The track marked Perry's foray into more [[electroclash]]-inspired tunes.

She collaborated with art-dance duo Fischerspooner on a few songs for their upcoming release and ended the year with a few co-writing credits on Gwen Stefani's debut, ''[[Love. Angel. Music. Baby.]]'', including the album's first single, "[[What You Waiting For?]]" Additionally, her Atlantic-distributed label, [[Custard Records]], was launched to promote two new acts, Sunshine and James Blunt. She produced and played guitar on the recording of Blunt's song "No Bravery".<ref>Liner notes from ''[[Back to Bedlam]]''</ref> The year ended with Perry co-writing "Save Me" for the southern California punk rock band [[Unwritten Law]].

Releases for 2005 included Kelly Osbourne's second album, which was written and produced by Perry. The lead track from Osbourne's second album, "[[One Word]]," reached the top of the UK and US dance charts.

Perry contributed to Christina Aguilera's third studio album, ''[[Back to Basics (Christina Aguilera album)|Back to Basics]]'' (2006). Perry and Aguilera co-wrote every song on the album's second disc.

2007 saw Perry working with Vanessa Carlton on her third studio album, ''[[Heroes and Thieves]]''. She also co-wrote and did session work on many of the songs on [[Sierra Swan]]'s solo album, ''Ladyland''. She continued work with Courtney Love, [[Kelis]], Cheap Trick, Ziggy Marley, Ben Jelen, [[Deborah Dyer|Skin]], [[Enrique Iglesias]], [[The Format]] on the song "Dead End," and "Darker Side of The Moon" on Bay Area artist [[Goapele]]'s ''Change It All'' album.

Perry won an award from the San Francisco chapter of the Recording Academy for her contribution to the world of music. The years 2007 and 2008 saw more tunes written or produced by Linda Perry: The Section Quartet, Alicia Keys, Vanessa Carlton, and Gina Gershon.

Perry signed the group [[Little Fish (band)|Little Fish]] to her label in 2008 and began producing its album,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://squidsquad.co.uk/?p=105 |work=[[Little Fish (band)|Little Fish Official Website]] |access-date=February 14, 2010 |date=June 20, 2008 |title=Little Fish Sign Record Deal! }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/oxford/content/articles/2008/05/19/little_fish.shtml|title=Little Fish special|publisher=[[BBC Oxford]]|access-date=May 19, 2008}}</ref> titled ''[[Baffled and Beat]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendId=44063861&blogId=528815373 |work=[[Myspace]] |access-date=February 17, 2010 |date=February 9, 2010 |title=First Review Of Our Album "Baffled & Beat" |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207065936/http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view |archive-date=February 7, 2009 }}</ref> which was released in August 2010.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.custardrecords.com/artists/littlefish/index.html |work=[[Custard Records]] |access-date=February 17, 2010 |title=CUSTARD RECORDS: Little Fish Bio}}</ref>

So I met her and we just hit it off and we started writing all these other songs for the movie, and then... we just made a whole little album.”<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://variety.com/2018/music/news/dolly-parton-dumplin-best-song-candidate-1203047994/|title=Dolly Parton, Happy to Just Write Songs for 'Dumplin',' Is Ready to Act in '9 to 5' Sequel|last1=Willman|first1=Chris|date=November 29, 2018|website=Variety|language=en|access-date=December 13, 2018}}</ref>
