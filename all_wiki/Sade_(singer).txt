'''Helen Folasade Adu''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|commas=on|CBE}} ({{lang-yo|Fọláṣadé Adú}} {{IPA-yo|fɔ̄láʃādé ādú|}}; born 16 January 1959), known professionally as '''Sade Adu''' or simply '''Sade''' ({{IPAc-en|ʃ|ɑː|ˈ|d|eɪ}} {{respell|shah|DAY}}), is an English singer, songwriter, and actress, known as the lead singer of her [[Sade (band)|eponymous band]]. She has been credited as one of the most successful British female artists in history, and is often recognised as an influence on contemporary music.<ref name="Sunday Times Jan 10">{{cite web |last=Sandall |first=Robert |date=31 January 2010 |title=Sade Emerges from Her Own Country Retreat |url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/sade-emerges-from-her-country-retreat-h70c0x3v32r |access-date=2 September 2015 |work=[[The Sunday Times]] |archive-date=20 May 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180520125745/https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/sade-emerges-from-her-country-retreat-h70c0x3v32r |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name="VH1 100">{{cite web |date=13 February 2012 |title=The 100 Greatest Women In Music |url=http://www.vh1.com/news/1238/the-100-greatest-women-in-music/ |access-date=19 December 2012 |website=VH-1+Music |publisher=Viacom International Inc. |archive-date=7 June 2015 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20150607113036/http://www.vh1.com/news/1238/the-100-greatest-women-in-music/ |url-status=live }}</ref> Her services to music were also recognised with an award of the [[Officer of the Order of the British Empire]] chivalry honour in 2002, and later the rank of the Commander of the same order in 2017.

Born in [[Ibadan]], Nigeria, but brought up partly in [[Essex]], England, Sade gained modest recognition as a fashion designer and part-time model, prior to joining the band Pride in the early 1980s. After gaining attention as a performer, she formed the band Sade, and secured a recording contract with [[Epic Records]] in 1983. A year later the band released the album ''[[Diamond Life]]'', which became one of the best-selling albums of the era, and the best-selling debut ever by a British female vocalist. In July 1985, Sade was among the performers at the [[Live Aid]] charity concert at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]], and the following year she appeared in the film ''[[Absolute Beginners (film)|Absolute Beginners]]''. Following the band's third and fourth albums, ''[[Stronger Than Pride]]'' (1988) and ''[[Love Deluxe]]'' (1992), they went on hiatus after the birth of Sade's child, while the singer experienced widespread media coverage during the period for unsubstantiated claims of [[Major depressive disorder|mental health]] and [[addiction]] issues.

After a spell of eight years without an album, the band reunited in 1999, and released ''[[Lovers Rock (Sade album)|Lovers Rock]]'' in 2000. The album departed from the jazz-inspired inflections of their previous work, featuring mellower sounds and pop compositions. The band then underwent another hiatus, not producing music for another ten years until the release of ''[[Soldier of Love (album)|Soldier of Love]]''. Following that album's release, the band entered a third period of hiatus, and have only released two new songs (2018's "[[Flower of the Universe]]" for the soundtrack of Disney's ''[[A Wrinkle in Time (2018 film)|A Wrinkle in Time]]'' and "[[The Big Unknown]]", part of the soundtrack for [[Steve McQueen (director)|Steve McQueen]]'s film ''[[Widows (2018 film)|Widows]]'') to date.<ref>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2018/03/07/you-can-now-listen-to-sades-first-new-song-in-seven-years-flower-of-the-universe/?noredirect=on "You can now listen to Sade's first new song in seven years, 'Flower of the Universe' "] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180628204927/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2018/03/07/you-can-now-listen-to-sades-first-new-song-in-seven-years-flower-of-the-universe/?noredirect=on |date=28 June 2018 }}.

===1980–1984: Beginnings and ''Diamond Life''===
After completing a three-year course in fashion design, and later modeling briefly, Sade began backup singing with British band Pride. During this time, she formed a songwriting partnership with Pride's guitarist/saxophonist [[Stuart Matthewman]]; together, backed by Pride's rhythm section, they began doing their own sets at Pride gigs.<ref name=Background/> Her solo performances of the song "[[Smooth Operator]]" attracted the attention of record companies, and in 1983 Sade and Matthewman split from Pride, along with keyboardist Andrew Hale, bassist [[Paul Denman]] and drummer Paul Cook, to form the band Sade.<ref name="Sunday Times Jan 10" /><ref name=Background>{{cite magazine|title=Sade|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/sade/biography|magazine=Rolling Stone|access-date=3 March 2015|archive-date=4 April 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150404060308/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/sade/biography|url-status=live}}</ref> By the time she performed her first show at London's [[Heaven (nightclub)|Heaven]] nightclub, she had become so popular that 1,000 people were turned away at the door.

To promote the album, Sade and the band embarked on their fifth concert tour entitled [[Lovers Rock Tour]]. The tour was announced via the band's website in April 2001.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1442927/sade-sets-north-american-tour-dates.jhtml |title=Sade Sets North American Tour Dates|last=Reimer|first=Courtney |date=18 April 2001 |work=[[MTV News]] |publisher=[[MTV Networks]] |access-date=15 September 2012|archive-url=http://www.freezepage.com/1347773500UBKWBFLTNQ?url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1442927/sade-sets-north-american-tour-dates.jhtml |archive-date=16 September 2012}}</ref> The announcement stated the tour would begin in the summer of 2001 with 30 shows. Initial dates were rescheduled due to extended rehearsal time. The shows sold well, with many stops adding additional shows. In August 2001, the tour was extended by eight weeks due to ticket demand.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.livedaily.citysearch.com/news/3460.html |title=Sade Adds More Dates to U.S. Tour |last=Zahlaway|first=Jon |date=7 August 2001 |work=LiveDaily |publisher=Ticketmaster Entertainment, Inc. |access-date=15 September 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20011127043131/http://www.livedaily.citysearch.com/news/3460.html |archive-date=27 November 2001}}</ref> Deemed by many critics as a comeback tour, it marked the band's first performances since 1994 and took place in 2001.

==Legacy and impact==
''[[The New Yorker]]'' described Sade's voice as a "grainy [[contralto]] full of air that betrays a slight ache but no agony, and values even imperfect dignity over a show of pain", a "deeply English" quality that makes categorising the artist's voice difficult.<ref name="Frere-Jones">{{cite news|last=Frere-Jones|first=Sasha|title=The Long War|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2010/03/22/the-long-war|access-date=30 August 2015|work=The New Yorker|date=22 March 2010|archive-date=11 December 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151211131523/http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2010/03/22/the-long-war|url-status=live}}</ref> Her voice was described by the [[BBC]] as "husky and restrained" and compared to singer [[Billie Holiday]].

Sade's work has influenced and been recognised by many singers and hip hop artists. Rapper [[Rakim]] of [[Eric B. & Rakim]] stated he grew up listening to Sade's music and was influenced by her voice and style.
