'''''Idolator''''' is a music [[blog]]. Created by the [[blog network]] [[Gawker Media]] in August 2006, ''Idolator'' was later sold to rival blog network Buzz Media (later titled [[SpinMedia]]), which also owns [[Stereogum]]<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=March 22, 2010|url=http://paidcontent.org/article/419-gawker-media-paring-three-sites-gridskipper-idolator-wonkette-to-go/|title=Denton Slims Down Gawker Media: Gridskipper, Idolator, Wonkette Leave The Fold|publisher=paidContent|date=April 14, 2008|author=Weisenthal, Joseph}}</ref> and ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]''. In September 2016, the website was sold to Hive Media along with [[Buzznet]] and PureVolume.<ref name=":0">{{cite news|last1=Rys|first1=Dan|title=SpinMedia Sells Idolator, Buzznet & PureVolume to Hive Media|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/business/7518064/spinmedia-sells-idolator-buzznet-purevolume-hive-media|accessdate=September 22, 2016|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]]|date=September 21, 2016}}</ref>

From the 2007 departure of original head writer Brian Raftery until November 2009, the blog's head writer was [[Maura Johnston]],<ref>{{cite web|last=Riggs|first=Mike|url=http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/blogs/artsdesk/general/2009/11/09/maura-johnston-leaves-idolator/|title=Maura Johnston Leaves Idolator â€“ Arts Desk|publisher=Washingtoncitypaper.com|date=November 9, 2009|accessdate=May 31, 2012}}</ref> who was the sole remaining original contributor for the blog before her departure.<ref name=":0" /> In April 2009, other contributors to the blog were laid off by Buzz Media, with the exception of Chris Molanphy, who offered to continue writing his ''100 & Single'' column on a voluntary basis until Johnston's departure.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://idolator.com/5221491/a-moment-of-gratitude-with-an-assist-from-big-star|title=A Moment Of Gratitude (With An Assist From Big Star)|last=Johnston|first=Maura|publisher=Idolator.com|accessdate=May 31, 2012}}</ref>

''Idolator'' has had several moments of controversy, including one that was initiated by a post made by the blog that claimed that a post made by [[Wired News]] made several predictions that Idolator believed were widely inaccurate.<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=March 22, 2010|url=https://www.wired.com/listening_post/2008/10/is-listening-po/|title=Nerd Beef! Idolator vs. Listening Post|publisher=Wired News|date=October 27, 2008|author=Thill, Scott}}</ref> The blog also took advantage of controversy surrounding the [[Pazz & Jop]] critics' poll by ''[[The Village Voice]]'' in November 2006.<ref>{{cite news|accessdate=March 22, 2010|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/30/arts/music/30idol.html|title=Meaty, Beaty, Big and Bloggy: An Online Poll Covets the Territory Once Owned by Pazz & Jop|work=The New York Times|date=November 30, 2006|author=Sisario, Ben}}</ref>
