'''Yahoo! News''' is a news website that originated as an internet-based [[news aggregator]] by [[Yahoo!]]. The site was created by a Yahoo! software engineer named Brad Clawsie in August 1996. Articles originally came from news services such as the [[Associated Press]], [[Reuters]], [[Fox News]], [[Al Jazeera]], [[ABC News]], ''[[USA Today]]'', [[CNN]] and [[BBC News]].

In 2001, Yahoo! News launched the first "most-emailed" page on the web. It was well-received as an innovative idea, expanding people's understanding of the impact that online news sources have on news consumption.<ref name=pamela>{{cite news|last=LiCalzi O'Connell|first=Pamela|title=New Economy; Yahoo Charts the Spread of the News by E-Mail, and What It Finds Out Is Itself Becoming News.|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/01/29/business/new-economy-yahoo-charts-spread-e-mail-what-it-finds-itself-becoming.html|newspaper=New York Times|date=29 January 2001}}</ref> Yahoo allowed comments for news articles until December 19, 2006, when commentary was disabled.
