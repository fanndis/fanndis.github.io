'''First Lady of the United States''' ('''FLOTUS''') is the title held by the hostess of the [[White House]], usually the wife of the [[president of the United States]], concurrent with the president's term in office. Although the first lady's role has never been codified or officially defined, she figures prominently in the political and social life of the nation.<ref name=Britannica>{{cite web|last1=Caroli|first1=Betty Boyd|title=First Lady: United States title|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/first-lady-United-States-title|website=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=September 30, 2016|archive-date=May 15, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190515184644/https://www.britannica.com/topic/first-lady-United-States-title|url-status=live}}</ref> Since the early 20th century, the first lady has been assisted by official staff, now known as the [[Office of the First Lady of the United States|Office of the First Lady]] and headquartered in the [[East Wing]] of the [[White House]].

[[Melania Trump]] is the current first lady of the United States, as wife of 45th president of the United States, [[Donald Trump]].

While the title was not in general use until much later, [[Martha Washington]], the wife of [[George Washington]], the first U.S. president (1789–1797), is considered to be the inaugural first lady of the United States. During her lifetime, she was often referred to as "Lady Washington".<ref>{{cite book|last=Figueroa|first=Acton|title=Washington, Part 3 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7SbH-nF2QcYC&pg=PA10|date=January 1, 2003|publisher=World Almanac Library|isbn=978-0-8368-5162-5|page=10}}</ref>

Since the 1790s, the role of first lady has changed considerably. It has come to include involvement in political campaigns, management of the White House, championship of social causes, and representation of the president at official and ceremonial occasions. As first ladies now typically [[List of memoirs by First Ladies of the United States|publish their memoirs]], which are viewed as potential sources of additional information about their husbands' administrations, and because the public is interested in these increasingly independent women in their own right, first ladies frequently remain a focus of attention long after their husbands' terms of office have ended.<ref name=Britannica /> Additionally, over the years individual first ladies have held influence in a range of sectors, from fashion to public opinion on policy. Historically, should a president be unmarried, or a widower, the president usually asks a relative or friend to act as White House hostess.

There are four living former first ladies: [[Rosalynn Carter]], wife of [[Jimmy Carter]]; [[Hillary Clinton]], wife of [[Bill Clinton]]; [[Laura Bush]], wife of [[George W. Bush]]; and [[Michelle Obama]], wife of [[Barack Obama]].

== Origins of the title ==
[[File:Martha Washington by Rembrandt Peale c1856.png|left|thumb|[[Martha Washington]] by [[Rembrandt Peale]], circa 1856, based on a portrait by his father, [[Charles Willson Peale]]]]

The use of the title ''[[First Lady]]'' to describe the spouse or hostess of an executive began in the United States. In the early days of the republic, there was not a generally accepted title for the wife of the president. Many early first ladies expressed their own preference for how they were addressed, including the use of such titles as "Lady", "Mrs. President" and "Mrs. Presidentress"; [[Martha Washington]] was often referred to as "Lady Washington." One of the earliest uses of the term "First Lady" was applied to her in an 1838 newspaper article that appeared in the ''St. Johnsbury Caledonian'', the author, "Mrs. Sigourney", discussing how Martha Washington had not changed, even after her husband [[George Washington|George]] became president. She wrote that "The first lady of the nation still preserved the habits of early life. Indulging in no indolence, she left the pillow at dawn, and after breakfast, retired to her chamber for an hour for the study of the scriptures and devotion."<ref>{{cite news |title=Martha Washington |work=St. Johnsbury Caledonian |date=August 7, 1838 |page=1}}</ref>

[[File:Dolley Madison.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Dolley Madison]] was said to be the first wife of a president to be referred to as "First Lady" (this was at her funeral in 1849).]]

[[Dolley Madison]] was reportedly referred to as first lady in 1849 at her funeral in a eulogy delivered by President [[Zachary Taylor]]; however, no written record of this eulogy exists, nor did any of the newspapers of her day refer to her by that title.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.firstladies.org/biographies/firstladies.aspx?biography=4 |title=First Lady Biography: Dolley Madison |publisher=National First Ladies' Library |access-date=March 1, 2007 |archive-date=September 15, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190915191544/http://www.firstladies.org/biographies/firstladies.aspx?biography=4 |url-status=live }}</ref> Sometime after 1849, the title began being used in Washington, D.C., social circles. One of the earliest known written examples comes from November 3, 1863, diary entry of [[William Howard Russell]], in which he referred to gossip about "the First Lady in the Land", referring to [[Mary Todd Lincoln]]. The title first gained nationwide recognition in 1877, when newspaper journalist [[Mary C. Ames]] referred to [[Lucy Webb Hayes]] as "the First Lady of the Land" while reporting on the inauguration of [[Rutherford B. Hayes]]. The frequent reporting on Lucy Hayes' activities helped spread use of the title outside Washington. A popular 1911 comedic play about Dolley Madison by playwright Charles Nirdlinger, titled ''The First Lady in the Land'', popularized the title further. By the 1930s, it was in wide use. Use of the title later spread from the United States to other nations.

When [[Edith Wilson]] took control of her husband's schedule in 1919 after he had a debilitating stroke, one Republican senator labeled her "the Presidentress who had fulfilled the dream of the suffragettes by changing her title from First Lady to Acting First Man."<ref>{{cite book |first=Sharon |last=Creeden |title=In Full Bloom: Tales of Women in Their Prime |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E2DyOCFDrcwC&pg=PA30 |year=1999 |publisher=August House |page=30|isbn=9780874835762 }}</ref>

The wife of the vice president of the United States is sometimes referred to as the [[second lady of the United States]] ('''SLOTUS'''), but this title is much less common.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}

Another acronym used is '''FLOTUS''', or First Lady of the United States. According to the [[Nexis]] database, the term (which is pronounced FLOW-tus, to rhyme with Potus, and not FLOT-tus) was first used in 1983 by Donnie Radcliffe, writing in ''[[The Washington Post]]''.<ref>{{cite web|author=[[Safire, William]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/10/12/magazine/on-language-potus-and-flotus.html|title=On Language; Potus And Flotus|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=October 12, 1997|archivedate=September 9, 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180909183029/https://www.nytimes.com/1997/10/12/magazine/on-language-potus-and-flotus.html}}</ref><ref>[https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/FLOTUS "FLOTUS"].

=== Non-spouses in the role ===
Several women (at least thirteen) who were not presidents' wives have served as first lady, as when the president was a bachelor or widower, or when the wife of the president was unable to fulfill the duties of the first lady herself. In these cases, the position has been filled by a female relative or friend of the president, such as [[Presidency of Thomas Jefferson|Jefferson's]] daughter [[Martha Jefferson Randolph]], [[Andrew Jackson#Presidency (1829–1837)|Jackson's]] daughter-in-law [[Sarah Yorke Jackson]] and his wife's niece [[Emily Donelson]], [[Zachary Taylor|Taylor]]'s daughter [[Mary Elizabeth Bliss]], [[Benjamin Harrison]]'s daughter [[Mary Harrison McKee]], [[James Buchanan#Presidency 1857–1861|Buchanan's]] niece [[Harriet Lane]], and [[Grover Cleveland|Cleveland's]] sister [[Rose Cleveland]].{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}

The position of the first lady is not an elected one and carries only ceremonial duties. Nonetheless, first ladies have held a highly visible position in American society.<ref name="role">{{cite web|url=http://www.america.gov/st/elections08-english/2008/September/20080926162204naneerg0.8945886.html|title=The Role of the First Lady|date=September 26, 2008|accessdate=May 4, 2009|last=Anthony|first=Carl Sferrazza|publisher=America.gov|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090510171719/http://www.america.gov/st/elections08-english/2008/September/20080926162204naneerg0.8945886.html|archivedate=May 10, 2009}}</ref> The role of the first lady has evolved over the centuries. She is, first and foremost, the hostess of the White House.<ref name="role" /> She organizes and attends official ceremonies and functions of state either along with, or in place of, the president. Lisa Burns identifies four successive main themes of the first ladyship: as public woman (1900–1929); as political celebrity (1932–1961); as political activist (1964–1977); and as political interloper (1980–2001).<ref>{{cite book |first=Lisa M. |last=Burns |title=First Ladies and the Fourth Estate: Press Framing of Presidential Wives |year=2008 |location=DeKalb, IL |publisher=Northern Illinois University Press |isbn=978-0-87580-391-3}}</ref>

Martha Washington created the role and hosted many affairs of state at the national capital (New York and Philadelphia). This socializing became known as the [[Republican Court]] and provided elite women with opportunities to play backstage political roles.<ref>{{cite journal|first1=David S.|last1=Shields|first2=Fredrika J.|last2=Teute|name-list-style=amp|title=The Republican Court and the Historiography of a Women's Domain in the Public Sphere|journal=Journal of the Early Republic|volume=35|issue=2|year=2015|pages=169–183 |url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/580270/summary|doi=10.1353/jer.2015.0033}}</ref> Both Martha Washington and [[Abigail Adams]] were treated as if they were "ladies" of the British royal court.<ref name="role" />

[[Dolley Madison]] popularized the first ladyship by engaging in efforts to assist orphans and women, by dressing in elegant fashions and attracting newspaper coverage, and by risking her life to save iconic treasures during the [[War of 1812]]. Madison set the standard for the ladyship and her actions were the model for nearly every first lady until [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] in the 1930s.<ref name="role" /> Roosevelt traveled widely and spoke to many groups, often voicing personal opinions to the left of the president's. She authored a weekly newspaper column and hosted a radio show.<ref>{{cite book |first = Brigid |last = O'Farrell |title = She was one of us: Eleanor Roosevelt and the American worker |location = Ithaca, NY |publisher = Cornell University Press |year = 2010}}{{page needed|date=February 2017}}</ref> [[Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis|Jacqueline Kennedy]] led an effort to redecorate and restore the White House.<ref>{{cite journal |first= Gil |last= Troy |title = Jacqueline Kennedy's White House renovations |journal = White House Studies |volume = 1 |issue = 3 |year = 2001 |pages=  395–404}}</ref>

Many first ladies became significant fashion trendsetters.<ref name="role" /> Some have exercised a degree of political influence by virtue of being an important adviser to the president.<ref name="role" />

Over the course of the 20th century, it became increasingly common for first ladies to select specific causes to promote, usually ones that are not politically divisive. It is common for the first lady to hire a staff to support these activities. [[Lady Bird Johnson]] pioneered environmental protection and beautification.<ref>{{cite book |first = Lewis L. |last = Gould |title = Lady Bird Johnson and the environment |location= |publisher = University Press of Kansas |year= 1988|page= }}{{full citation needed|date=February 2017}}</ref> [[Pat Nixon]] encouraged volunteerism and traveled extensively abroad; [[Betty Ford]] supported women's rights; [[Rosalynn Carter]] aided those with mental disabilities; [[Nancy Reagan]] founded the [[Just Say No]] drug awareness campaign; [[Barbara Bush]] promoted literacy; [[Hillary Clinton]] sought to reform the healthcare system in the U.S.; [[Laura Bush]] supported women's rights groups, and encouraged childhood literacy.<ref name="role" /> [[Michelle Obama]] became identified with supporting military families and tackling childhood obesity;<ref name="Michelle Obama White House Page">{{cite web |url=https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/about/first-ladies/michelleobama|title=Michelle Obama |publisher=The White House |accessdate=May 4, 2010}}</ref> and [[Melania Trump]] has stated that she wants to use her position to help children, including prevention of [[cyberbullying]] and supporting children whose lives are affected by drugs.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Superville|first1=Darlene|title=Melania Trump Filling Out Her Agenda as First Lady|url=https://www.usnews.com/news/politics/articles/2017-10-09/melania-trump-saying-2-words-more-often-first-lady|accessdate=November 8, 2017|work=U.S. News & World Report|agency=Associated Press|date=October 9, 2017}}</ref>

Near the end of her husband's [[Presidency of Bill Clinton|presidency]], Clinton became the first first lady to run for political office. During the campaign, her daughter, [[Chelsea Clinton|Chelsea]], took over much of the first lady's role. Victorious, Clinton served as [[United States Senate|U.S. senator]] from New York from 2001 to 2009, when she resigned to become President Obama's [[United States Secretary of State|secretary of state]] until 2013. Clinton was the [[2016 Democratic National Convention|Democratic Party]] nominee for president in the [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 election]], but lost to [[Donald Trump]].

The Office of the First Lady of the United States is accountable to the first lady for her to carry out her duties as hostess of the White House, and is also in charge of all social and ceremonial events of the White House. The first lady has her own staff that includes a chief of staff, press secretary, [[White House Social Secretary]], and [[White House Chief Floral Designer|Chief Floral Designer]].

Despite the significant responsibilities usually handled by the first lady, the first lady does not receive a salary.

== Exhibitions and collections ==
Established in 1912, the First Ladies Collection has been one of the most popular attractions at the [[Smithsonian Institution]]. The original exhibition opened in 1914 and was one of the first at the Smithsonian to prominently feature women. Originally focused largely on fashion, the exhibition now delves deeper into the contributions of first ladies to the presidency and American society. In 2008, "First Ladies at the Smithsonian" opened at the [[National Museum of American History]] as part of its reopening year celebration. That exhibition served as a bridge to the museum's expanded exhibition on first ladies' history that opened on November 19, 2011. "The First Ladies" explores the unofficial but important position of first lady and the ways that different women have shaped the role to make their own contributions to the presidential administrations and the nation. The exhibition features 26 dresses and more than 160 other objects, ranging from those of [[Martha Washington]] to [[Michelle Obama]], and includes [[White House china]], personal possessions and other objects from the Smithsonian's unique collection of first ladies' materials.<ref name="Smithsonian">{{cite web|url=http://americanhistory.si.edu/exhibitions/small_exhibition.cfm?key=1267&exkey=863&pagekey=864&CFID=9611372&CFTOKEN=75585282|title=The First Ladies|publisher=National Museum of American History, Smithsonian Institution|accessdate=April 4, 2012|archive-date=August 19, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120819165829/http://americanhistory.si.edu/exhibitions/small_exhibition.cfm?key=1267&exkey=863&pagekey=864&CFID=9611372&CFTOKEN=75585282|url-status=live}}</ref>[[File:Jacqueline Lee Bouvier Kennedy.gif|thumb|right|200px|Official portrait of Jacqueline Kennedy at the White House.]]
