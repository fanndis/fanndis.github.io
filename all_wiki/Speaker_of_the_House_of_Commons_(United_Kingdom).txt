The '''Speaker of the House of Commons''' is the [[chief administrative officer|chief officer]] and highest authority of the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]], the [[lower house]] and primary chamber of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]].<ref name="aboutSpeaker">{{cite web|url=https://www.parliament.uk/business/commons/the-speaker/the-role-of-the-speaker/role-of-the-speaker/|title=Office and Role of Speaker|website=UK Parliament|accessdate=8 November 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191031043623/https://www.parliament.uk/business/commons/the-speaker/the-role-of-the-speaker/role-of-the-speaker/|archive-date=31 October 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> The current Speaker, Sir [[Lindsay Hoyle]], was elected Speaker on 4 November 2019, following the retirement of [[John Bercow]]. Hoyle began his first full parliamentary term in the role on 17 December 2019, having unanimously been re-elected after the [[2019 United Kingdom general election|2019 general election]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-50828196|title=Hoyle re-elected Commons Speaker as MP's return|publisher=BBC|date=17 December 2019|accessdate=17 December 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191218060750/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-50828196|archive-date=18 December 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

The Speaker [[Speaker (politics)|presides]] over the House's debates, determining which members may speak and which [[Amend (motion)|amendments]] are selected for consideration. The Speaker is also responsible for maintaining order during debate, and may punish members who break the rules of the House. Unlike presiding officers of legislatures in many other countries, Speakers remain strictly non-partisan and renounce all affiliation with their former political parties when taking office and afterwards.

The Speaker does not take part in debate or vote (except to break ties; and even then, the convention is that the Speaker casts the tie-breaking vote according to [[Speaker Denison's rule]] which results either in further debate or a vote for the status quo). Aside from duties relating to presiding over the House, the Speaker also performs administrative and procedural functions: they chair the [[House of Commons Commission]], the [[Speaker's Committee for the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority]] (SCIPSA), the [[Speaker's Committee on the Electoral Commission]] (SCEC), and the four [[Boundary commissions (United Kingdom)|Boundary Commissions]]. In addition, they remain a constituency [[Member of Parliament]] (MP), are part of the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]], and represent the Commons to the [[Monarch of the United Kingdom|Monarch]], the [[House of Lords]] and other authorities.<ref name="aboutSpeaker"/> The Speaker has the right and obligation to reside in Speaker's House at the [[Palace of Westminster]].<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/8112582.stm | title=What does the Speaker actually do? | publisher=BBC News | accessdate=23 June 2009 | date=22 June 2009 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090626115045/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/8112582.stm | archive-date=26 June 2009 | url-status=live }}</ref>

==History==

===Early history===
The office of Speaker is almost as old as Parliament itself. The earliest year for which a presiding officer has been identified is 1258, when [[Peter de Montfort]] presided over the Parliament held in Oxford. Early presiding officers were known by the title ''parlour'' or ''prolocutor''. The continuous history of the office of Speaker is held to date from 1376<ref>{{cite book |editor-first=J.S. |editor-last=Roskell |title=The History of Parliament: The House of Commons 1386–1421 |publisher=Alan Sutton Publishing |isbn=9780862999438}}</ref> when Sir [[Peter de la Mare]] spoke for the commons in the "[[Good Parliament]]" as they joined leading magnates in purging the chief ministers of [[the Crown]] and the most unpopular members of the king's household. [[Edward III of England|Edward III]] was frail and in seclusion; his prestigious eldest son, [[Edward, the Black Prince|Edward the Black Prince]], terminally ill. It was left to the next son, a furious [[John of Gaunt]], to fight back. He arrested De la Mare and disgraced other leading critics.

In the next, "[[Bad Parliament]]", in 1377, a cowed Commons put forward Gaunt's steward, [[Thomas Hungerford (Speaker)|Thomas Hungerford]], as their spokesman in retracting their predecessors' misdeeds of the previous year. Gaunt evidently wanted a "mirror-image" as his form of counter-coup and this notion, born in crisis, of one 'speaker', who quickly also became 'chairman' and organiser of the Commons' business, was recognised as valuable and took immediate root after 1376–7.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}

On 6 October 1399, Sir [[John Cheyne (speaker)|John Cheyne]] of Beckford (Gloucester) was elected speaker. The powerful [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], [[Thomas Arundel]], is said to have voiced his fears of Cheyne's reputation as a critic of the Church. Eight days later, Cheyne resigned on grounds of ill-health, although he remained in favour with the king and active in public life for a further 14 years.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}

Although the officer was elected by the Commons at the start of each Parliament, with at least one contested election known, in 1420 ([[Roger Hunt (speaker)|Roger Hunt]] prevailing by a majority of just four votes), in practice the Crown was usually able to get whom it wanted.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}} Whilst the principle of giving this spokesman personal immunity from recrimination{{vague|date=March 2019}} as only being the voice of the whole body was quickly adopted and did enhance the Commons' role, the Crown found it useful to have one person with the authority to select and lead the lower house's business and responses to the Crown's agenda, much more often than not in the way the Crown wanted. Thus, [[Whig history|Whig]] ideas of the Commons growing in authority as against royal power are somewhat simplistic; the Crown used the Commons as and when it found it advantageous to do so, and the speakership was one means to make the Commons a more cohesive, defined and effective instrument of the king's government.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}

Throughout the medieval and early modern period, every speaker was an MP for a county, reflecting the implicit position that such shire representatives were of greater standing in the house than the more numerous burgess (municipality) MPs. Although evidence is almost non-existent, it has been surmised that any vote was by count of head, but by the same token perhaps the lack of evidence of actual votes suggests that most decisions, at least of a general kind, were reached more through persuasion and the weight by status of the county MPs. In such a situation, the influence of the speaker should not be underestimated. Sir [[Thomas More]] was the first speaker to go on to become [[Lord Chancellor]].{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}

===17th to mid-19th century===
Until the 17th century, members of the House of Commons often continued to view their speaker (correctly) as an agent of the Crown. As Parliament evolved, however, the Speaker's position grew to involve more duties to the House than to the Crown; this was definitely true by the time of the [[English Civil War]]. This change is sometimes said to be reflected by an incident in 1642, when [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] entered the House in order to search for and arrest [[five members]] for [[high treason]]. When the King asked him if he knew of the location of these members, the Speaker, [[William Lenthall]], replied: "May it please your Majesty, I have neither eyes to see nor tongue to speak in this place but as the House is pleased to direct me, whose servant I am here."<ref>From the journal of Sir Simonds d'Ewes, quoted in Cobbett's Parliamentary History of England : From the Norman conquest, in 1066. To the year, 1803 (1807), p. 1010.</ref>

The development of [[Cabinet government]] under [[William III of England|King William III]] in the late 17th century caused further change in the role of the Speaker. Speakers were generally associated with the ministry, and often held other government offices. For example, [[Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford and Mortimer|Robert Harley]] served simultaneously as Speaker and as a [[Secretary of State]] between 1704 and 1705.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}

The speaker between 1728 and 1761, [[Arthur Onslow]], reduced ties with the government, though the office remained to a large degree political.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}

===The modern speakership===
The speakership evolved into its modern form—in which the holder is an impartial and apolitical officer who does not belong to any party—only during the middle of the 19th century.

Over 150 individuals have served as Speaker of the House of Commons. Their names are inscribed in gold leaf around the upper walls of Room C of the [[House of Commons Library]]. [[Betty Boothroyd]], elected in 1992, was the first female Speaker (the first woman to sit in the Speaker's chair was [[Betty Harvie Anderson]], a Deputy Speaker from 1970). Michael Martin, elected in 2000, was the first [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] speaker since the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]. [[John Bercow]], elected in 2009, was the first [[Jew]]ish speaker.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jta.org/news/article/2009/06/23/1006053/british-lawmakers-elect-first-jewish-speaker|title=British lawmakers elect first Jewish speaker|work=JTA|date=23 June 2009|accessdate=30 November 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090626120347/http://jta.org/news/article/2009/06/23/1006053/british-lawmakers-elect-first-jewish-speaker|archive-date=26 June 2009|url-status=live}}</ref>

The Speaker has significant influence on legislation, for example by selecting which amendments to a bill may be proposed, and by interpreting and enforcing the rules of Parliament as laid out in the official parliamentary rulebook, ''[[Erskine May: Parliamentary Practice|Erskine May]]''. In 2019 Speaker John Bercow had significant influence in selecting which important amendments to legislation affecting [[Brexit|Britain's exit from the European Union]] could be voted on,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/brexit-amendments-explained-the-four-options-john-bercow-has-selected-for-a-vote-by-mps-a4091871.html |title=Brexit amendments explained: Wollaston, Benn amendments and the options John Bercow has selected for a vote by MPs |newspaper=Evening Standard |date=14 March 2019 |author=Jacob Jarvis |accessdate=18 March 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190314223905/https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/brexit-amendments-explained-the-four-options-john-bercow-has-selected-for-a-vote-by-mps-a4091871.html |archive-date=14 March 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> and later by not allowing the government to repeat a vote on the terms of exit, as the same motion may not be proposed twice in the same session of Parliament.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.parliament.uk/about/living-heritage/evolutionofparliament/parliamentwork/offices-and-ceremonies/collections/erskine-may/erm-treatise/|title=Erskine May: A treatise on the law, privileges, proceedings and usage of Parliament.|publisher=Parliament.uk; History of the Parliamentary Estate|date=1844|accessdate=19 March 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171025131243/http://www.parliament.uk/about/living-heritage/evolutionofparliament/parliamentwork/offices-and-ceremonies/collections/erskine-may/erm-treatise/|archive-date=25 October 2017|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=walker/> Bercow was criticised for these interventions, but said that he was acting within his powers and enforcing clear rules in a non-partisan way.

Until 1992 all Speakers were men, and were always addressed in Parliament as "Mr Speaker", and their deputies as "Mr Deputy Speaker". Betty Boothroyd was, at her request, addressed as "Madam Speaker". When Betty Harvie Anderson served in the 1970s as a Deputy Speaker, on the other hand, she was addressed as "Mr Deputy Speaker". [[Eleanor Laing]], a Deputy Speaker since 2013, is addressed as "Madam Deputy Speaker".

MPs elect the Speaker from amongst their own ranks.<ref name=speakerelection>{{cite web |url=http://www.parliament.uk/documents/commons-information-office/m02.pdf |pages=4–5 |title=The Speaker |location=Westminster, United Kingdom |publisher=House of Commons Information Office |date=September 2003 |access-date=13 May 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130706234527/http://www.parliament.uk/documents/commons-information-office/m02.pdf |archive-date=6 July 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref> The House must elect a Speaker at the beginning of each new parliamentary term after a [[general election]], or after the death or resignation of the incumbent.<ref name=speakerelection/> Once elected, a Speaker continues in office until the dissolution of Parliament, unless they resign prior to this. Customarily, the House re-elects speakers who desire to continue in office for more than one term. Theoretically, the House could vote against re-electing a Speaker, but such an event is contrary to historical convention.

The procedure for electing a Speaker has changed in recent years. Until 1971, the [[Clerk of the House of Commons]] became temporary Chairman of the House. As the clerk is never a member, and therefore is not permitted to speak, he would silently stand and point at the member who was to speak. However, this procedure broke down at the election of a new Speaker in 1971 ([[#Notable elections|see below]]) and had to be changed. Since that time, as recommended by a [[Select committee (United Kingdom)|Select committee]], the [[Father of the House (United Kingdom)|Father of the House]] (the member of the House with the longest period of unbroken service who is not a minister) becomes the presiding officer.<ref name=speakerelection/>

Until 2001, the election of a Speaker was conducted as a routine matter of House of Commons business, as it used [[motion and amendment (election)|motions and amendments to elect]]. A member would [[Motion (parliamentary procedure)|move]] "That Mr(s) [X] do take the Chair of this House as Speaker", and following debate (which may have included an [[Amend (motion)|amendment]] to replace the name of the member on whom the speakership was to be conferred), a routine division of the House would resolve in favour of one candidate. There was, however, a considerable amount of behind-the-scenes lobbying before suitable candidates were agreed upon, and so it was very rare for a new speaker to be opposed. However, this system broke down in 2000 when twelve rival candidates declared for the job and the debate occupied an entire parliamentary day.<ref name=speakerelection/> The House of Commons Procedure Committee then re-examined the means of electing a speaker and recommended a new system that came into effect in 2007 and was first used in June 2009, following the resignation of [[Michael Martin, Baron Martin of Springburn|Michael Martin]].

Under the new system, candidates must be nominated by at least twelve members, of whom at least three must be of a different party from the candidate. Each member may nominate no more than one candidate. The House then votes by [[secret ballot]]; an [[absolute majority]] (i.e. more than 50% of the votes cast) is required for victory. If no candidate wins a majority, then the individual with the fewest votes is eliminated, as are any other candidates who receive less than 5% of the votes cast, and as are any candidates who choose to withdraw. The House continues to vote, for several rounds if necessary, until one member receives the requisite majority. Then, the House votes on a formal motion to appoint the member in question to the Speakership. (In the unlikely event that this motion fails, the House must hold a fresh series of ballots on all of the nominees.)

If only one candidate is nominated, then no ballot is held, and the House proceeds directly to the motion to appoint the candidate to the Speakership. A similar procedure is used if a Speaker seeks a further term after a general election: no ballot is held, and the House immediately votes on a motion to re-elect the Speaker. If this motion fails, candidates are nominated, and the House proceeds with voting (as described above).

Upon the passage of the motion, the speaker-elect is expected to show reluctance at being chosen; they are customarily "dragged unwillingly" by MPs to the speaker's bench.<ref name="bbcjun09"/> This custom has its roots in the speaker's original function of communicating the Commons' opinions to the monarch. Historically, the Speaker, representing the House to the monarch, potentially faced the monarch's anger and therefore required some persuasion to accept the post.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.parliament.uk/about/how/role/traditions/ |title=Traditions of Parliament |location=Westminster, United Kingdom |publisher=Parliament of the United Kingdom |access-date=31 January 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101105231004/http://www.parliament.uk/about/how/role/traditions/ |archive-date=5 November 2010 |url-status=live }}</ref> Contrary to an often repeated claim, no speaker has ever been executed for his actions in that capacity. Six former speakers have been executed (sometimes many years after their terms); for five of these, the execution was due to their close association with a former king after a new monarch had succeeded.

The speaker-elect must receive approbation by the sovereign before they may take office. On the day of the election, the speaker-elect leads the Commons to the Chamber of the House of Lords, where [[Lords Commissioners]] appointed by the Crown confirm him or her in the monarch's name. The speaker then requests "in the name and on behalf of the Commons of the United Kingdom, to lay claim, by humble petition to Her Majesty, to all their ancient and undoubted rights and privileges, especially to freedom of speech in debate, to freedom from arrest, and to free access to Her Majesty whenever occasion shall require." After the Lords Commissioners, on the behalf of the sovereign, confirm the Commons' rights and privileges, the Commons return to their chamber. If a speaker is chosen in the middle of a parliament due to a vacancy in the office, they must receive the royal approbation as described above but does not again lay claim to the Commons' rights and privileges.

===Notable elections===
[[File:William Court Gully NPG.jpg|left|thumb|William Court Gully]]
Though the election of a Speaker is normally non-partisan, there have been several controversial elections in history. For example, [[1895 Speaker of the British House of Commons election|in 1895]], the sudden retirement of [[Arthur Wellesley Peel, 1st Viscount Peel|Arthur Peel]] came at a time when partisan feelings were running high. The Conservatives and [[Liberal Unionist Party|Liberal Unionists]] put forward [[Matthew White Ridley, 1st Viscount Ridley|Sir Matthew White Ridley]], a well-respected MP who had many years of experience, and hoped for a unanimous election as the previous Speaker had been a Liberal. However, the Liberals decided to oppose him and nominated [[William Court Gully, 1st Viscount Selby|William Court Gully]] who had been an MP for only nine years and had been a relatively quiet presence. On a party-line vote, Gully was chosen by 285 to 274. Although Gully proved his impartiality to the satisfaction of most of his opponents and was unanimously re-elected after the [[1895 United Kingdom general election|1895 general election]], the episode left many Unionists bitter. During that year's general election, Gully became one of the few Speakers to be opposed in his own constituency, a sign of the bitterness of the time. It was not until the mid-1930s that it became common for a Speaker to face some form of opposition for re-election.

The [[1951 Speaker of the British House of Commons election|1951 election]] was similarly controversial. After the incumbent speaker, [[Douglas Clifton Brown]], retired at the [[1951 United Kingdom general election|1951 general election]], there was a great demand from the Labour Party for Major [[James Milner, 1st Baron Milner of Leeds|James Milner]] to become the first Labour speaker after he had served as deputy speaker for eight years. However, the Conservatives (who had just regained power) nominated [[William Morrison, 1st Viscount Dunrossil|William Shepherd Morrison]] against him. The vote again went down party lines, and Morrison was elected. Milner received a peerage as compensation.

In [[1971 Speaker of the British House of Commons election|1971]], having had early warning that [[Horace Maybray King, Baron Maybray-King|Horace King]] would be retiring, the Conservatives took the lead in offering to the Labour Party either [[Selwyn Lloyd]] or [[John Boyd-Carpenter]] as potential speakers. The Labour Party chose Selwyn Lloyd, partly because he was perceived as a weak figure. However, when the House of Commons debated the new speaker, Conservative MP [[Robin Maxwell-Hyslop]] and Labour MP [[Willie Hamilton]] nominated [[Geoffrey de Freitas]], a senior and respected backbench Labour MP. De Freitas was taken aback by the sudden nomination and urged the House not to support him (a genuine feeling, unlike the feigned reluctance which all speakers traditionally show). Lloyd was elected, but there was a feeling among all parties that the system of election needed to be overhauled. A candidate's consent is now required before they can be nominated.

The last three instances of the election of a new speaker (1992, 2000 and 2009) have all been relatively controversial. [[Bernard Weatherill]] had announced his impending retirement a long time before the [[1992 United Kingdom general election|1992 general election]], leading to a long but suppressed campaign for support. [[Betty Boothroyd, Baroness Boothroyd of Sandwell|Betty Boothroyd]], a Labour MP who had been a deputy speaker, was known to be extremely interested in becoming the first woman speaker (and in doing so, finished the chances of fellow Labour MP [[Harold Walker, Baron Walker of Doncaster|Harold Walker]] who had also been a deputy speaker). The Conservative former Cabinet member [[Peter Brooke, Baron Brooke of Sutton Mandeville|Peter Brooke]] was put forward at a late stage as a candidate. Unlike previous elections, there was an active campaign among Conservative MPs to support Boothroyd and about 70 of them did so, ensuring her election. She was the only speaker elected in the 20th century not to be a member of the governing party at the time of her first election.

Betty Boothroyd announced her retirement shortly before the summer recess in 2000, which left a long time for would-be speakers to declare their candidature but little opportunity for Members of Parliament to negotiate and decide on who should be chosen. Many backbench Labour MPs advanced the claims of [[Michael Martin, Baron Martin of Springburn|Michael Martin]]. Most Conservatives felt strongly that the recent alternation between the main parties ought to be maintained and a Conservative Speaker chosen. The most prominent Conservative choices were Sir [[Sir George Young, 6th Baronet|George Young]] and Deputy Speaker Sir [[Alan Haselhurst]]. With several additional candidates announcing themselves, the total number of Members seeking the Speakership was 14, none of whom would withdraw. A lengthy sitting of the House saw Michael Martin first proposed, then each of the other candidates proposed in turn as amendments, which were all voted down. In [[point of order|points of order]] before the debate, many members demanded a secret ballot.

==Non-partisanship==
By convention the Speaker severs all ties with his or her political party while in office, as it is considered essential they be seen as an impartial presiding officer.<ref name="bbcjun09">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/8111887.stm |title=Tory MP Bercow is elected Speaker |date=22 June 2009 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=22 June 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090622011834/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/8111887.stm |archive-date=22 June 2009 |url-status=live }}</ref> Many have served in ministerial or other political positions beforehand. For example, [[Selwyn Lloyd]] and [[George Thomas, 1st Viscount Tonypandy|George Thomas]] had both served as high-ranking Cabinet members and [[Bernard Weatherill]] and [[Betty Boothroyd]] had been a party [[Whip (politics)|whip]].

In the House, the Speaker does not vote on any motion, except to resolve ties (see section below). By modern convention the deputies (actively presiding roles) adhere to this and number one from the Speaker's former party, and two from the other side of the House. Thus no net voting, nor Commons speeches, power is lost for government or the opposition.<ref>{{cite web |title=Election of Deputy Speakers – News from Parliament |url=https://www.parliament.uk/business/news/2017/june/election-of-deputy-speakers/ |website=UK Parliament |accessdate=6 March 2019 |language=English |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190306174816/https://www.parliament.uk/business/news/2017/june/election-of-deputy-speakers/ |archive-date=6 March 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>

After leaving office, the Speaker normally takes no part in party politics; if elevated to the [[House of Lords]], they would normally sit as a [[crossbencher]]. If a former Speaker desires to be (re-)elected back to the House, they may rejoin their pre-speakership party.

=== Seat in Parliament ===
The speaker will customarily seek re-election at a general election (or if there is a voting/candidacy anomaly resulting in a by-election) not under a party label – being entitled to describe themselves on the ballot as "The Speaker seeking re-election".<ref>The [[Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000#Registration of parties|Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act]]</ref> Most were returned unopposed but this has not happened since the 1960s. The main (usually two) parties taking part in the offsetting of three Deputies and Speaker (i.e. two each) seldom field opponents by logic and convention; opponents are deemed to question the Speaker's role, performance or means of appointment if they stand.

When ex-Tory [[Edward FitzRoy]] was opposed by a Labour Party candidate at the [[1935 United Kingdom general election|1935 general election]], there was strong disapproval from other parties and a sub-committee of the Cabinet considered whether a special single-candidate [[electoral district|constituency]] should be created for the speaker. The sub-committee concluded that parliamentary opinion would not favour this suggestion. Likewise, in December 1938 the Commons rejected a motion from the Prime Minister for a Select Committee to re-examine the idea.<ref>{{cite news |title=The Speaker and Elections |date=16 December 1938 |work=The Times |page=16}}</ref> The sub-committee, chaired by former Prime Minister [[David Lloyd George]], reported in April 1939 that no change should be made; permitting opposition to a sitting speaker would be "a serious infringement of democratic principles" and that "to alter the status of the Speaker, so that he ceased to be returned to the House of Commons by the same electoral methods as other members or as a representative of a Parliamentary constituency, would be equally repugnant to the custom and tradition of the House".<ref>{{cite news |title=The Speaker's Seat |date=14 April 1939 |work=The Times |page=8}}</ref><ref>"Report from the Select Committee on Parliamentary Elections (Mr. Speaker's Seat)", House of Commons Paper 98, 1938–39 Session, HM Stationery Office 1939.</ref>

[[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] and [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] candidates opposed [[Selwyn Lloyd]] in both elections in 1974. Labour and the [[Social Democratic Party (UK)|SDP]] stood against [[Bernard Weatherill]] in 1987. Speakers for Scottish and Welsh seats commonly face nationalist opponents: [[Plaid Cymru]] stood against [[George Thomas, 1st Viscount Tonypandy|George Thomas]] at his re-election, and [[Scottish National Party]] candidates stood against [[Michael Martin, Baron Martin of Springburn|Michael Martin]] throughout, as their party constitution requires them to stand in all seats in Scotland, since [[October 1974 United Kingdom general election|October 1974]]. In [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010]] Speaker [[John Bercow]] faced ten opponents, including [[Nigel Farage]], former leader of the [[UK Independence Party]] polling 17.4% of the vote and [[John Stevens (English politician)|John Stevens]], from the Buckinghamshire Campaign for Democracy party polling 21.4%. Bercow won with 47% of the vote.

==Role==
===Presiding officer===
The Speaker's primary function is to preside over the House of Commons.<ref name=thespeaker>{{cite web |url=http://www.parliament.uk/documents/upload/M02.pdf |title=The Speaker |location=Westminster, United Kingdom |publisher=House of CommonsInformation Office |date=September 2003 |access-date=25 June 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090625153107/http://www.parliament.uk/documents/upload/M02.pdf |archive-date=25 June 2009 |url-status=live }}</ref> Traditionally, the Speaker when presiding wore court dress—a black coat with white shirt and bands, beneath a black gown, with stockings and buckled shoes, and a full-bottomed wig. But in 1992 Betty Boothroyd, the first female Speaker, eschewed the wig. Her successor, [[Michael Martin, Baron Martin of Springburn|Michael Martin]], also declined to wear the wig; moreover, he chose to simplify other aspects of the costume, doing away with the once customary buckled court shoes and silk stockings. His successor [[John Bercow]] abandoned traditional dress, wearing a plain black gown over his lounge suit when presiding.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article6565099.ece |work=The Times |publisher=Times Newspapers Ltd |date=24 June 2009|accessdate=25 June 2009|title=Farewell to tights as new Speaker John Bercow presides over Commons |author=Philip Webster}}</ref> For ceremonial occasions such as the State Opening, the Speaker wears a black and gold robe with a train; previously, this was worn over court dress with a white waterfall cravat, but the present Speaker wears plain morning dress.

Whilst presiding, the Speaker sits in a chair at the front of the House. Traditionally, members supporting the Government sit on his or her right, and those supporting the Opposition on his or her left. The Speaker's powers are extensive—much more so than those of his or her [[House of Lords|Lords]] counterpart, the [[Lord Speaker]]. Most importantly, the Speaker calls on members to speak;<ref name=thespeaker/> no member may make a speech without the Speaker's prior permission. By custom, the Speaker alternates between members supporting the Government and those supporting the Opposition. Members direct their speeches not to the whole House, but to the Speaker, using the words "Mister Speaker" or "Madam Speaker". Members must refer to each other in the third person by the name of their constituency or their ministerial titles (not their names); they may not directly address anyone other than the Speaker (who does call them by name). In order to remain neutral, the Speaker generally refrains from making speeches, although there is nothing to prevent him or her from doing so.  For example, on Tuesday 1st September 2020, Speaker Hoyle addressed the House on the subject of the arrest of a Conservative MP for rape.<ref>{{cite hansard|url=https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2020-09-01/debates/1C26048C-133D-4406-8761-756951455CF5/Speaker’SStatement|house=House of Commons|date=1 September 2020|title=Speaker’s Statement|url-status=live}}</ref>

During debate, the Speaker is responsible for maintaining discipline and order,<ref name=discipline/> and rules on all points of order (objections made by members asserting that a rule of the House has been broken); the decisions may not be appealed. The Speaker bases decisions on the rules of the House and on precedent; if necessary, they may consult with the [[Clerk of the House of Commons|Parliamentary Clerks]] before issuing a ruling.<ref name=thespeaker/> In addition, the Speaker has other powers that may be used to maintain orderly debate. Usually, the Speaker attempts to end a disruption, or "calls members to order", by loudly repeating "ORDER! ORDER!". If members do not follow instructions, the Speaker may punish them by demanding that they leave the House for the remainder of the day's sitting. For grave disobedience, the Speaker may "[[naming (parliamentary procedure)|name]]" a member, by saying "I name [Mr/Mrs X]." (deliberately breaching the convention that members are only referred to by reference to their constituency, "The [Right] Honourable Member for [Y]"). The House may then vote to suspend the member "named" by the Speaker, for five sitting days for a first offence.<ref name=thespeaker/><ref name=discipline>{{cite web |url=https://www.parliament.uk/documents/commons-information-office/g06.pdf |publisher=House of Commons Information Office |location=Westminster, United Kingdom |date=September 2010 |title=Factsheet G6: Disciplinary and Penal Powers of the House |page=2 |quote=If a Member has disregarded the authority of the Chair, or has persistently and wilfully obstructed the House by abusing its rules, they may (after generally being given every opportunity to set matters to rights) be named. That is, the Speaker says "I name Mr William White [or whoever]". Thereupon, usually the Leader of the House, the Government Chief Whip, or the senior minister present, moves "that Mr William White be suspended from the service of the House". If the motion is passed, if necessary after a division, the Member is directed to withdraw, and suspension (for five sitting days for a first offence), follows. A second offence in the same Session will lead to suspension for 20 sitting days, and a third, to suspension for a period the House shall decide. Should a Member refuse to withdraw, and then resist removal by the Serjeant at Arms, suspension for the remainder of the Session ensues. Where the Member has been suspended from the service of the House then under Standing Order No. 44 salary is forfeited during the suspension. |access-date=3 April 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190724133205/https://www.parliament.uk/documents/commons-information-office/g06.pdf |archive-date=24 July 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> In case of "grave disorder", the Speaker may immediately adjourn the entire sitting.<ref name=discipline/> This power has been invoked [[List of incidents of grave disorder in the British House of Commons|on several occasions]] since it was conferred in 1902.

In addition to maintaining discipline, the speakers must ensure that debate proceeds smoothly. If they finds that a member is making irrelevant remarks, is tediously repetitive, or is otherwise attempting to delay proceedings, they may order the member to end the speech.

Before a debate begins in which "many members have expressed a wish to speak" or in which allotted Parliamentary time is short, the Speaker may ask honorable members for (in reality demand) Short Speeches, under which they set a time limit (at least eight minutes). At the same time, however, the Speaker is charged with protecting the interests of the minority by ensuring sufficient debate before a vote. Thus, the Speaker may disallow a [[cloture|closure]], which seeks to end debate and immediately put the question to a vote, if the Speaker finds that the motion constitutes an abuse of the rules or breaches the rights of the minority.

Before the members of the House, excluding the Speaker, vote on any issue, the Speaker "puts the question"; that is, they orally state the motion on which the members are to vote, and the members present say "aye" or "no". If this [[voice vote]] indicates a clear majority the result will usually be accepted, but if the acclamation is unclear or any member demands it, a [[division (vote)|division]] (vote in the aye and noe lobbies in which members names are taken) takes place; the Speaker and deputy speakers do not vote. The Speaker may overrule a request for a division and maintain the original ruling; this power, however, is used only rarely, usually when members make frivolous requests for a division to delay proceedings.

===Casting votes===
{{main|Speaker Denison's rule}}
When the Ayes and Noes are tied, the Speaker must use the [[casting vote]]. By convention the casting vote is issued in accordance with the [[Constitutional convention (political custom)|constitutional convention]] known as [[Speaker Denison's rule]], rather than in line with the Speaker's personal opinion in the matter. The principle is always to vote in favour of further debate, or, where it has been previously decided to have no further debate or in some specific instances, to vote in favour of the status quo. For example, the Speaker would vote against a closure motion, or the final passage of a bill, or an amendment.

Since the House of Commons has over 600 members, tied votes are very uncommon and Speakers are rarely called upon to use the casting vote. Since 1801, there have been only 50 instances of tied divisions. A casting vote by a Speaker was cast on 3 April 2019, the first since 1993, against an amendment to the Business of the House Motion. Speaker Bercow declared that it was not the role of the chair to create a majority that did not otherwise exist for action.<ref>{{cite web |title=Amendment (a) to the Business of the House motion |url=https://commonsvotes.digiminster.com/Divisions/Details/671 |website=CommonsVotes |publisher=UK Parliament |accessdate=3 April 2019 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190403165904/https://commonsvotes.digiminster.com/Divisions/Details/671 |archive-date=3 April 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=MPs return tied vote over Brexit indicative vote proposal |url=https://www.breakingnews.ie/world/mps-return-tied-vote-over-brexit-indicative-vote-proposal-915260.html |work=Breaking News |date=3 April 2019 |access-date=5 April 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190404200028/https://www.breakingnews.ie/world/mps-return-tied-vote-over-brexit-indicative-vote-proposal-915260.html |archive-date=4 April 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Other functions===
According to parliamentary rules, the Speaker is the highest authority of the House of Commons and has final say over how its business is conducted, as well as other key choices, for example, which [[Table (parliamentary procedure)|tabled]] amendments are selected for votes.<ref name=walker>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/mar/18/what-has-john-bercow-done-now |title=What has John Bercow done now? |newspaper=The Guardian |date=18 March 2019 |author=Peter Walker |accessdate=18 March 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190318232859/https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/mar/18/what-has-john-bercow-done-now |archive-date=18 March 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> In addition to the role of presiding officer, the Speaker performs several other functions on the behalf of the House of Commons. The Speaker represents the body in relations with the Sovereign, the House of Lords, and non-parliamentary bodies. On important occasions of state (such as [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II's]] [[Golden Jubilee]] in 2002), the Speaker presents Addresses to the Crown on behalf of the House.
The Speaker performs various procedural functions such as recalling the House from recess during a national emergency, or when otherwise requested by the Government. When vacancies arise, the Speaker authorises the issuance of [[writ of election|writs of election]]. Furthermore, the Speaker is responsible for certifying bills that relate solely to national taxation as "[[money bill]]s" under the [[Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949]]. The House of Lords has no power to block or substantially delay a money bill; even if the Lords fail to pass the bill, it becomes law within a month of passage by the Commons. The Speaker's decision on the matter is final, and cannot be challenged by the Upper House. Under the [[English votes for English laws]] procedures, the Speaker certifies which bills or parts of bills relate to England or England & Wales only.<ref>{{cite web | title = New 'veto' announced for English MPs | publisher =BBC |work=BBC News | date =2 July 2015 | url =https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-33351688 | accessdate =15 November 2020}}</ref>

The Speaker is also responsible for overseeing the administration of the House. The Speaker chairs the [[House of Commons Commission]], a body that appoints staff, determines their salaries, and supervises the general administration of those who serve the House. Furthermore, the Speaker controls the parts of the [[Palace of Westminster]] used by the House of Commons. Also, the Speaker is the ''ex officio'' Chairman of the four [[boundary commissions (United Kingdom)|boundary commissions]] (for [[England]], [[Wales]], [[Scotland]], and [[Northern Ireland]]), which are charged with redrawing the boundaries of parliamentary constituencies to reflect population changes. However, the Speaker normally does not attend meetings of the boundary commissions; instead, the Deputy Chairman of the commission (usually a judge) normally presides.

Finally, the Speaker continues to represent his or her constituency in Parliament. Like any other Member of Parliament, the Speaker deals with issues raised by constituents and attempts to address their concerns.

==Deputies==
The Speaker is helped by three deputies elected by the House (addressed ''Mr/Madam Deputy Speaker''). The most senior has an alternate style ''[[Chairman of Ways and Means]]''; the title derives from the defunct Ways and Means Committee which could amend and expedite bills to tax. The others can be called the second or third deputy speakers but are formally in the House named the First and Second Deputy Chairmen of Ways and Means (this resembles the "Junior [[Lords of the Treasury]]" being the government chief whips). Typically the Speaker presides for three hours each day; otherwise a deputy takes the Chair. During the [[Budget Day#In the United Kingdom|annual Budget]], which the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] reads out in outline, the Chairman of Ways and Means presides.

The Speaker never presides over the [[Committee of the Whole House (United Kingdom)|Committee of the Whole House]], which consists of all the members, but operates under more flexible rules of debate. This device was used so that members could debate independently of the Speaker, who they suspected acted as an agent or spy of the monarch. Now the procedure is invoked to have a less procedurally strict debate.

Deputies have the same powers as the Speaker when presiding and in deadlock are bound by constitutional precedent to follow Speaker Denison's rule. They do not take part in partisan politics and remain completely impartial in the House. They are entitled to take a full part in constituency politics including raising of questions, often written, of ministers. In general elections, they stand as party politicians.

==Precedence, salary, residence and privileges==
The Speaker is one of the highest-ranking officials in the United Kingdom. By an [[Order in Council]] issued in 1919, the Speaker ranks in the [[United Kingdom order of precedence|order of precedence]] above all non-royal individuals except the Prime Minister, the Lord Chancellor, and the [[Lord President of the Council]]. In England and Wales, he also [[order of precedence in England and Wales|ranks]] below the two [[archbishop]]s of the [[Church of England]], in Scotland, he also [[order of precedence in Scotland|ranks]] below the [[Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland]], and in Northern Ireland, he also ranks below the [[Church of Ireland]] and [[Roman Catholic]] [[archbishop]]s of Ireland, and the [[Moderator of the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland|Moderator of the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church]].{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}

In 2010, the Speaker received a salary of £145,492,<ref name=salary>{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/documents/commons-information-office/m06.pdf|title=Ministerial Salaries|date=September 2010|accessdate=13 May 2013|publisher=House of Commons Information Office|location=Westminster, United Kingdom|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130706183832/http://www.parliament.uk/documents/commons-information-office/m06.pdf|archive-date=6 July 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> equal to that of a Cabinet Minister.

The procession includes the [[Doorkeeper (Houses of Parliament)|Doorkeeper]], the [[Serjeant-at-Arms]], the Speaker, a trainbearer, the Chaplain, and the Speaker's Private Secretary. The Serjeant-at-Arms attends the Speaker on other occasions, and in the House; they bear a [[ceremonial mace]] that symbolises the royal authority under which the House meets, as well as the authority of the House of Commons itself.

Speakers, according with their high order of precedence, are appointed to the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]] on election.

On retirement most were since the [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms]] elevated to the House of Lords as [[viscount]]s. The last ennobled was [[George Thomas, 1st Viscount Tonypandy]] in 1983. Since then, the custom has been to offer [[Life Peerages Act 1958|life peerages (life baronies)]] to those retiring. Division on John Bercow's legacy led to the universality of this precedent being questioned by the 2017-2019 minority government.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-46913477 |title=Speaker Bercow 'could be denied peerage' |website=BBC News |date=18 January 2019 |author=Chris Mason |accessdate=18 March 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190120140541/https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-46913477 |archive-date=20 January 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Speaker's Chaplain===
{{main|Chaplain to the Speaker of the House of Commons}}
Chaplain to the Speaker was traditionally a [[Dean and Chapter of Westminster|canon residentiary]] of [[Westminster Abbey]]; from {{abbreviation|c.|circa (about)}}1990-2010 the post was held by that canon who is [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|Rector]] of [[St Margaret's, Westminster]] (the parish church between Parliament and the Abbey). Under Speaker Bercow for 2010-2019 the Rt. Revd. [[Rose Hudson-Wilkin]] then serving as [[Vicar]] of [[Dalston]] and [[Haggerston]] was appointed Speaker's Chaplain, the first chaplain appointed not to be a canon of the Abbey.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.parliament.uk/business/news/2010/06/new-speakers-chaplain-appointed/ |publisher=Parliament of the United Kingdom |title=New Speaker's Chaplain appointed |accessdate=27 July 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140728080008/http://www.parliament.uk/business/news/2010/06/new-speakers-chaplain-appointed/ |archive-date=28 July 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref> The Speaker's Chaplain commences daily proceedings by leading prayers and also conducts marriages of Members when they are carried out in the crypt chapel of the Palace of Westminster.

==Official dress==
[[File:John Singleton Copley - Henry Addington, First Viscount Sidmouth.jpg|thumb|[[Henry Addington]] in state robes. Portrait by [[John Singleton Copley]].]]

On normal sitting days, the Speaker wears a black silk lay-type gown (similar to a Queen's Counsel's gown) with a train and a mourning rosette (also known as a 'wig bag') over the flap collar at the back.

On state occasions (such as the [[Opening of Parliament]]), the Speaker wears a robe of black satin damask trimmed with gold lace and [[Frog (fastening)|frogs]] with full bottomed wig and, in the past, a [[tricorne]] hat.<ref>Campbell, Una (1989). ''Robes of the Realm''. Michael O'Mara Books Ltd: London. pp. 53–54.</ref>

The previous Speaker, John Bercow, no longer wore the traditional [[court dress]] outfit, which included knee breeches, silk stockings and buckled court shoes under the gown, or the wig. Betty Boothroyd first decided not to wear the wig<ref>[http://www.londonbusinessforum.com/events/order_order_order London Business Forum – Order, Order, Order] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150527143532/http://www.londonbusinessforum.com/events/order_order_order |date=27 May 2015 }} 21 November 2006</ref> and [[Michael Martin, Baron Martin of Springburn|Michael Martin]] chose not to wear knee breeches, silk stockings or the traditional buckled shoes, preferring flannel trousers and Oxford shoes.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8365971.stm |publisher=BBC News |title=Speaker Bercow ditches stockings |date=18 November 2009}}</ref> Bercow chose not to wear court dress altogether in favour of a [[lounge suit]], as he felt uncomfortable in court dress<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/jun/23/bercow-speaker-traditional-costume |work=The Guardian |title=John Bercow abandons traditional dress as he begins Speaker role |date=23 June 2009 |access-date=16 December 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170513015640/https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/jun/23/bercow-speaker-traditional-costume |archive-date=13 May 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8118143.stm |publisher=BBC News |title=Tailors let down by Speaker dress |date=25 June 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/conservative/6998215/Betty-Boothroyd-criticises-John-Bercow-over-rejection-of-Speakers-outfit.html |work=The Daily Telegraph |title=Betty Boothroyd criticises John Bercow over rejection of Speaker's outfit |date=15 January 2010 |access-date=4 April 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180328170404/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/conservative/6998215/Betty-Boothroyd-criticises-John-Bercow-over-rejection-of-Speakers-outfit.html |archive-date=28 March 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref> (he wore [[morning dress]] under the State Robe at State Openings). As seen at the 2015 State Opening of Parliament, Bercow further toned down the state robe by removing the gold frogging on the sleeves and train, so that it now resembles a [[pro-chancellor]]'s robe at certain universities. However, he returned to wearing the traditional robe in 2016. The new speaker elected in November 2019, [[Lindsay Hoyle|Sir Lindsay Hoyle]], wears a gown like Bercow, but continues to wear his parliamentary identification card on a lanyard, as he did while Deputy Speaker. He later said he would wear the full court dress on ceremonial occasions, which he first did at the State Opening on 19 December 2019, with lanyard included, albeit without the wig, which had gone missing.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2019/12/17/speakers-wig-goes-missing-just-state-opening-parliament-says/|title=Speaker's wig goes missing just before the State Opening of|work=The Telegraph|date=17 December 2019|last=Hope|first=Christopher|access-date=20 December 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191220121205/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2019/12/17/speakers-wig-goes-missing-just-state-opening-parliament-says/|archive-date=20 December 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>
