'''Jazz hands''' in performance [[dance]] is the extension of a performer's hands with palms toward the audience and fingers splayed. This position is also referred to as '''webbing'''. It is commonly associated with especially exuberant types of performance such as [[musicals]], [[cheerleading]], [[show choir]], [[revue]], and especially [[jazz dance]] shows.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} In cheerleading, the position with arms outstretched and fingers wiggling up and down is sometimes referred to as '''spirit fingers'''<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.wisegeek.com/what-are-spirit-fingers.htm |title=What are Spirit Fingers? |access-date=4 February 2019}}</ref> or '''jazz fingers'''.{{cn|date=April 2017}} Depending on the performance venue, both gestures can be associated with [[Camp (style)|campiness]].<ref>Zimmerman, Karla and Nate Cavalieri (2008).

Probably the biggest proponent of jazz hands was [[Bob Fosse]], who incorporated them in nearly all of his Broadway and film musical choreography. The best example of this is the opening musical number of ''[[Pippin (musical)|Pippin]]'', "[[Magic to Do]]", in which still illuminated jazz hands are the first thing the audience sees.

==Description==
In the basic jazz hands position, the hands are open, the palms face forward, and the fingers are splayed;  in addition sometimes the hands are shaken and the fingers are moving.<ref>Andreu, Helen (2003). ''Jazz Dance Styles and Steps for Fun''. Authorhouse. p. 146.</ref>  The arm is often straight.<ref>Kraines, Minda Goodman (2001). ''Jump into Jazz''. Mayfield Publishing Company. p. 39.</ref> [[Gus Giordano]] describes the position as the "palm of the hand facing forward with fingers stretched".<ref>Giordano, Gus (1992). ''Jazz Dance Class: Beginning thru Advanced''. Princeton Book Company. p. xxix.</ref> [[Frank Hatchett]] instructs dancers to "spread fingers (jazz hands); face palms front".<ref>Hatchett, Frank (2000). ''Frank Hatchett's Jazz Dance''. Human Kinetics, p. 26.</ref>

Neither Gus Giordano nor Frank Hatchett include shaking the hands in their description of jazz hands, but a choreographer may specify that the hands are to be shakenâ€”the motion is rapid and fluttering, as if jingling a [[tambourine]].{{cn|date=April 2017}}
