Nominally a [[Political union|union]] of multiple national [[Republics of the Soviet Union|Soviet republics]],{{efn|As outlined in Part III of the [[1977 Soviet Constitution]], "The National-State Structure of the USSR".}} it was a [[one-party state]] (until 1990) governed by the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]], with [[Moscow]] as its capital in its largest republic, the [[Russian SFSR]]. Other major urban centers were [[Leningrad]] ([[Russian SFSR]]), [[Kiev]] ([[Ukrainian SSR]]), [[Minsk]] ([[Byelorussian SSR]]), [[Tashkent]] ([[Uzbek SSR]]), [[Alma-Ata]] ([[Kazakh SSR]]) and [[Novosibirsk]] (Russian SFSR). It was the largest country in the world by surface area,<ref>Television documentary from CC&C Ideacom Production, "Apocalypse Never-Ending War 1918–1926", part 2, aired at Danish DR K on 22 October 2018.</ref> spanning over 10,000 kilometers (6,200&nbsp;mi) east to west across 11 [[time zone]]s and over 7,200 kilometers (4,500&nbsp;mi) north to south. Its territory included much of [[Eastern Europe]], parts of [[Northern Europe]], and all of [[Northern Asia|Northern]] and [[Central Asia]]. Its five climate zones were [[tundra]], [[taiga]], [[steppe]]s, [[desert]], and [[mountain]]s. Its diverse population was collectively known as [[Soviet people]].

The Soviet Union had its roots in the [[October Revolution]] of 1917 when the [[Bolsheviks]], headed by [[Vladimir Lenin]], overthrew the [[Russian Provisional Government|Provisional Government]] that had [[February Revolution|earlier replaced]] the [[House of Romanov|monarchy]] of the [[Russian Empire]]. They established the [[Russian Soviet Republic]],{{efn|Later renamed the Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic (1918) and the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (1936).}} beginning a [[Russian Civil War|civil war]] between the Bolshevik [[Red Army]] and many anti-Bolshevik forces across the former Empire, among whom the largest faction was the [[White movement|White Guard]], which engaged in violent anti-communist repression against the Bolsheviks and their worker and peasant supporters known as the [[White Terror (Russia)|White Terror]]. The Red Army expanded and helped local Bolsheviks take power, establishing [[Soviet (council)|soviets]], repressing their political opponents and rebellious peasants through [[Red Terror]]. By 1922, the Bolsheviks had emerged victorious, forming the Soviet Union with the unification of the Russian, [[Transcaucasian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic|Transcaucasian]], [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Ukrainian]] and [[Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic|Byelorussian]] republics. The [[New Economic Policy|New Economic Policy (NEP)]], which was introduced by Lenin, led to a partial return of a [[free market]] and [[private property]]; this resulted in a period of economic recovery.

Following [[Death and state funeral of Vladimir Lenin|Lenin's death]] in 1924, [[Joseph Stalin]] came to power. Stalin suppressed all political opposition to his rule inside the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]] and initiated a [[centrally planned economy]]. As a result, the country underwent a period of [[Industrialization in the Soviet Union|rapid industrialization]] and [[Collectivization in the Soviet Union|forced collectivization]], which led to significant economic growth, but also led to a [[Soviet famine of 1932–33|man-made famine in 1932–1933]] and expanded the [[Gulag]] labour camp system founded back in 1918. Stalin also fomented political paranoia and conducted the [[Great Purge]] to remove his actual and perceived opponents from the Party through mass arrests of military leaders, Communist Party members, and ordinary citizens alike, who were then sent to correctional labor camps or sentenced to death.

On 23 August 1939, after unsuccessful efforts to form an anti-fascist alliance with Western powers, the Soviets signed the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact|non-aggression agreement with Nazi Germany]]. After the [[Invasion of Poland|start of World War II]], the formally neutral Soviets invaded and annexed territories of several Eastern European states, including eastern [[Soviet invasion of Poland|Poland]] and the [[Soviet occupation of the Baltic states|Baltic states]]. In June 1941 the [[Operation Barbarossa|Germans invaded]], opening [[Eastern Front (World War II)|the largest and bloodiest theater of war]] in history. [[World War II casualties of the Soviet Union|Soviet war casualties]] accounted for the highest proportion of the conflict in the cost of acquiring the upper hand over [[Axis powers|Axis]] forces at intense battles such as [[Battle of Stalingrad|Stalingrad]]. Soviet forces eventually [[Battle of Berlin|captured Berlin]] and [[Victory Day (Russia)|won World War II in Europe]] on 9 May 1945. The territory overtaken by the Red Army became [[satellite state]]s of the [[Eastern Bloc]]. The [[Cold War]] emerged in 1947 as a result of a post-war Soviet dominance in [[Eastern Europe]], where the Eastern Bloc confronted the [[Western Bloc]] that united in the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] in 1949.

Following Stalin's death in 1953, a period known as [[de-Stalinization]] and the [[Khrushchev Thaw]] occurred under the leadership of [[Nikita Khrushchev]]. The country developed rapidly, as millions of peasants were moved into industrialized cities. The USSR took an early lead in the [[Space Race]] with the [[Sputnik 1|first ever satellite]] and the [[Vostok 1|first human spaceflight]]. In the 1970s, there was a brief ''[[détente]]'' of relations with the United States, but tensions resumed when the Soviet Union [[Soviet–Afghan War|deployed troops in Afghanistan]] in 1979. The war drained economic resources and was matched by an escalation of American military aid to [[Mujahideen#Afghanistan|Mujahideen]] fighters.

In the mid-1980s, the last Soviet leader, [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], sought to further reform and liberalize the economy through his policies of ''[[glasnost]]'' and ''[[perestroika]]''. The goal was to preserve the Communist Party while reversing [[Era of Stagnation|economic stagnation]]. The Cold War ended during his tenure and in 1989, [[Warsaw Pact]] countries in Eastern Europe [[Revolutions of 1989|overthrew their respective Marxist-Leninist regimes]]. This led to the rise of strong nationalist and separatist movements inside the USSR as well. Central authorities initiated a [[Soviet Union referendum, 1991|referendum]]—boycotted by the Baltic republics, Armenia, Georgia, and Moldova—which resulted in the majority of participating citizens voting in favor of preserving the Union as a [[Union of Sovereign States|renewed federation]]. In August 1991, [[1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt|a coup d'état was attempted]] by Communist Party hardliners. It failed, with Russian President [[Boris Yeltsin]] playing a high-profile role in facing down the coup, resulting in the banning of the Communist Party. On 25 December 1991, Gorbachev resigned and the remaining twelve constituent republics emerged from the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] as independent [[post-Soviet states]]. The [[Russia|Russian Federation]] (formerly the Russian SFSR) assumed the Soviet Union's rights and obligations and is recognized as its continued legal personality.

The USSR produced many significant social and [[Timeline of Russian inventions and technology records|technological]] achievements and innovations of the 20th century, including the world's [[Ministry of Health (Soviet Union)|first ministry of health]], [[Sputnik 1|first human-made satellite]], the [[Yuri Gagarin|first humans in space]] and [[Venera 7|the first probe to land on another planet]], [[Venus]].

== Etymology ==
{{main|Official names of the Soviet Union}}

{{history of Russia}}
The word ''[[Soviet (council)|soviet]]'' is derived from the Russian word ''sovet'' ({{lang-ru|совет}}), meaning "council", "assembly", "advice", "harmony", "concord",<ref group=note>{{lang-uk|рада}} (''[[rada]]''); {{lang-pl|rada}}; {{lang-be|савет/рада}}; {{lang-uz|совет}}; {{lang-kk|совет/кеңес}}; {{lang-ka|საბჭოთა}}; {{lang-az|совет}}; {{lang-lt|taryba}}; {{lang-mo|совиет}}; {{lang-lv|padome}}; {{lang-ky|совет}}; {{lang-tg|шӯравӣ/совет}}; {{lang-hy|խորհուրդ/սովետ}}; {{lang-tk|совет}}; {{lang-et|nõukogu}}.</ref> ultimately deriving from the proto-Slavic verbal stem of ''vět-iti'' ("to inform"), related to Slavic ''věst'' ("news"), English "wise", the root in "ad-vis-or" (which came to English through French), or the Dutch ''weten'' ("to know"; cf. ''wetenschap'' meaning "science"). The word ''sovietnik'' means "councillor".<ref name="americana">{{Cite Americana|wstitle=Soviet|year=1920|first=Henri F. |last=Klein}}</ref>

Some organizations in Russian history were called ''council'' ({{lang-ru|link=no|совет}}). In the [[Russian Empire]], the [[State Council (Russian Empire)|State Council]] which functioned from 1810 to 1917 was referred to as a Council of Ministers after the revolt of 1905.<ref name="americana" />

During the [[Georgian Affair]], [[Vladimir Lenin]] envisioned an expression of [[Great Russia]]n ethnic chauvinism by [[Joseph Stalin]] and his supporters, calling for these nation-states to join Russia as semi-independent parts of a greater union which he initially named as the Union of Soviet Republics of Europe and Asia ({{lang-rus|links=no|Союз Советских Республик Европы и Азии|Soyuz Sovetskikh Respublik Evropy i Azii}}).{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1p=608|2a1=Lewin|2y=1969|2p=50|3a1=Leggett|3y=1981|3p=354|4a1=Volkogonov|4y=1994|4p=421|5a1=Service|5y=2000|5p=455|6a1=White|6y=2001|6p=175}} Stalin initially resisted the proposal but ultimately accepted it, although with Lenin's agreement changed the name to the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR), albeit all the republics began as ''socialist soviet'' and did not change to the other order until [[1936 Soviet Constitution|1936]]. In addition, in the national languages of several republics, the word ''council'' or ''conciliar'' in the respective language was only quite late changed to an adaptation of the Russian ''soviet'' and never in others, e.g. [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Ukraine]].

''СССР'' (in Latin alphabet: ''SSSR'') is the abbreviation of USSR in Russian. It is written in [[Cyrillic alphabets]]. The Soviets used the Cyrillic abbreviation so frequently that audiences worldwide became familiar with its meaning. Notably, both Cyrillic letters used have orthographically-similar (but transliterally distinct) letters in [[Latin alphabets]]. Because of widespread familiarity with the Cyrillic abbreviation, Latin alphabet users in particular almost always use the orthographically-similar Latin letters ''C'' and ''P'' (as opposed to the transliteral Latin letters ''S'' and ''R'') when rendering the USSR's native abbreviation.

After ''СССР'', the most common short form names for the Soviet state in Russian were ''Советский Союз'' (transliteration: ''Sovetskiy Soyuz'') which literally means ''Soviet Union'', and also ''Союз ССР'' (transliteration: ''Soyuz SSR'') which, after compensating for grammatical differences, essentially translates to ''Union of SSR's'' in English.

In the English language media, the state was referred to as the Soviet Union or the USSR. In other European languages, the locally translated short forms and abbreviations are usually used such as ''Union soviétique'' and ''URSS'' in [[French language|French]], or ''Sowjetunion'' and ''UdSSR'' in [[German language|German]]. In the English-speaking world, the Soviet Union was also informally called Russia and its citizens Russians,<ref name="OXRussian">{{cite web|title=Russian|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/russian|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|accessdate=9 May 2017|quote=historical (in general use) a national of the former Soviet Union.|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171010070656/https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/russian|archive-date=10 October 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> although that was technically incorrect since Russia was only one of the republics.<ref name="MWRussia">{{Cite encyclopedia |title=Russia |encyclopedia=Merriam-Webster |url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Russia |date=10 May 2017 |accessdate=10 May 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170606105510/https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Russia |archivedate=6 June 2017 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Such misapplications of the linguistic equivalents to the term ''Russia'' and its derivatives were frequent in other languages as well.

{{history of the Soviet Union}}
Modern revolutionary activity in the [[Russian Empire]] began with the 1825 [[Decembrist revolt]]. Although [[Serfdom in Russia|serfdom]] was abolished in 1861, it was done on terms unfavorable to the peasants and served to encourage revolutionaries. A parliament—the [[State Duma (Russian Empire)|State Duma]]—was established in 1906 after the [[Revolution of 1905|Russian Revolution of 1905]], but [[Nicholas II of Russia|Tsar Nicholas II]] resisted attempts to move from [[Absolute monarchy|absolute]] to a [[constitutional monarchy]]. [[Rebellion|Social unrest]] continued and was aggravated during [[World War I]] by military defeat and food shortages in major cities.

A spontaneous popular uprising in [[Saint Petersburg|Petrograd]], in response to the wartime decay of Russia's economy and morale, culminated in the [[February Revolution]] and the toppling of [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]] and the imperial government in March 1917. The [[tsarist autocracy]] was replaced by the Russian Provisional Government, which intended to conduct elections to the [[Russian Constituent Assembly]] and to continue fighting on the side of the [[Allies of World War I|Entente]] in [[World War I]].

At the same time, [[workers' council]]s, known in [[Russian language|Russian]] as "[[Soviet (council)|Soviets]]", sprang up across the country. The [[Bolshevik]]s, led by [[Vladimir Lenin]], pushed for [[Communist revolution|socialist revolution]] in the Soviets and on the streets. On 7 November 1917, the Red Guards stormed the [[Winter Palace]] in Petrograd, ending the rule of the Provisional Government and leaving all political power to the Soviets.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/higher/history/russia/october/revision/1/|title=The causes of the October Revolution|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=5 August 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140805155250/http://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/higher/history/russia/october/revision/1/|archivedate=5 August 2014|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> This event would later be officially known in Soviet bibliographies as the [[October Revolution|Great October Socialist Revolution]]. In December, the Bolsheviks signed an [[armistice]] with the [[Central Powers]], though by February 1918, fighting had resumed. In March, the Soviets ended involvement in the war and signed the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk (Russia–Central Powers)|Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]].

A long and bloody [[Russian Civil War|Civil War]] ensued between the [[Red Army|Reds]] and the [[White movement|Whites]], starting in 1917 and ending in 1923 with the Reds' victory. It included [[Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War|foreign intervention]], the [[Shooting of the Romanov family|execution of the former tsar and his family]], and the [[Russian famine of 1921|famine of 1921]], which killed about five million people.<ref>{{cite book|author=Evan Mawdsley|title=The Russian Civil War|url=https://archive.org/details/russiancivilwar00evan|url-access=registration|date=1 March 2007|publisher=Pegasus Books|isbn=978-1-933648-15-6|page=[https://archive.org/details/russiancivilwar00evan/page/287 287] |author-link=Evan Mawdsley}}</ref> In March 1921, during [[Polish–Soviet War|a related conflict with Poland]], the [[Peace of Riga]] was signed, splitting disputed territories in [[Belarus]] and [[Ukraine]] between the [[Second Polish Republic|Republic of Poland]] and Soviet Russia.

On 28 December 1922, a conference of plenipotentiary delegations from the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russian SFSR]], the [[Transcaucasian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic|Transcaucasian SFSR]], the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Ukrainian SSR]] and the [[Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic|Byelorussian SSR]] approved the [[Treaty on the Creation of the USSR]]<ref>Richard Sakwa ''The Rise and Fall of the Soviet Union, 1917–1991: 1917–1991''.

Initially, Lenin was to be replaced by a "[[Collective leadership|troika]]" consisting of [[Grigory Zinoviev]] of the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Ukrainian SSR]], [[Lev Kamenev]] of the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russian SFSR]], and [[Joseph Stalin]] of the [[Transcaucasian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic|Transcaucasian SFSR]].

On 1 February 1924, the USSR was recognized by the United Kingdom. The same year, a [[1924 Soviet Constitution|Soviet Constitution]] was approved, legitimizing the December 1922 union. Despite the foundation of the Soviet state as a federative entity of many constituent republics, each with its own political and administrative entities, the term "Soviet Russia"{{spaced ndash}}strictly applicable only to the Russian Federative Socialist Republic{{spaced ndash}}was often applied to the entire country by non-Soviet writers and politicians.

On 3 April 1922, Stalin was named the [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]]. Lenin had appointed Stalin the head of the [[Rabkrin|Workers' and Peasants' Inspectorate]], which gave Stalin considerable power. By [[Rise of Joseph Stalin|gradually consolidating his influence and isolating and outmanoeuvring his rivals within the party]], Stalin became the [[dictator|undisputed leader]] of the country and, by the end of the 1920s, established a [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]] rule. In October 1927, Zinoviev and [[Leon Trotsky]] were expelled from the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Central Committee]] and forced into exile.

In 1928, Stalin introduced the [[first five-year plan]] for building a [[Socialist economics|socialist economy]]. In place of the [[Proletarian internationalism|internationalism]] expressed by Lenin throughout the Revolution, it aimed to build [[Socialism in One Country]].

In 1939, the Soviet Union made a dramatic shift toward Nazi Germany. Almost a year after Britain and France had concluded the [[Munich Agreement]] with Germany, the Soviet Union made agreements with Germany as well, both militarily and economically during [[German–Soviet Axis talks|extensive talks]]. The two countries concluded the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]] and the [[German–Soviet Commercial Agreement (1940)|German–Soviet Commercial Agreement]] in August 1939. The former made possible the Soviet occupation of [[Occupation of the Baltic states|Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia]], [[Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and northern Bukovina|Bessarabia, northern Bukovina]], and [[Soviet invasion of Poland|eastern Poland]]. In late November, unable to coerce the [[Finland|Republic of Finland]] by diplomatic means into moving its border {{Convert|25|km}} back from [[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad]], Stalin ordered the [[Winter War|invasion of Finland]]. In the east, the Soviet military won several decisive victories during [[Soviet–Japanese border conflicts|border clashes]] with the [[Empire of Japan]] in 1938 and 1939. However, in April 1941, the USSR signed the [[Soviet–Japanese Neutrality Pact]] with Japan, recognizing the territorial integrity of [[Manchukuo]], a Japanese [[puppet state]].

Germany broke the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact and [[Operation Barbarossa|invaded the Soviet Union]] on 22 June 1941 starting what was known in the USSR as the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Great Patriotic War]]. The [[Red Army]] stopped the seemingly invincible German Army at the [[Battle of Moscow]], aided by an unusually harsh winter. The [[Battle of Stalingrad]], which lasted from late 1942 to early 1943, dealt a severe blow to Germany from which they never fully recovered and became a turning point in the war.

During the immediate post-war period, the Soviet Union rebuilt and expanded its economy, while maintaining its [[Command economy|strictly centralized control]]. It took effective control over most of the countries of Eastern Europe (except [[Tito-Stalin split|Yugoslavia]] and later [[Soviet-Albanian split|Albania]]), turning them into [[satellite state]]s. The USSR bound its satellite states in a military alliance, the [[Warsaw Pact]], in 1955, and an economic organization, Council for Mutual Economic Assistance or [[Comecon]], a counterpart to the [[European Economic Community]] (EEC), from 1949 to 1991.<ref name="fas.org">{{cite web |url=https://fas.org/irp/world/russia/gru/ |title=Main Intelligence Administration (GRU) Glavnoye Razvedovatel'noye Upravlenie – Russia / Soviet Intelligence Agencies |publisher=Fas.org |accessdate=24 November 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081226090607/http://www.fas.org/irp/world/russia/gru/ |archive-date=26 December 2008 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The USSR concentrated on its own recovery, seizing and transferring most of Germany's industrial plants, and it exacted [[World War II reparations|war reparations]] from [[East Germany]], [[People's Republic of Hungary|Hungary]], [[People's Republic of Romania|Romania]], and [[People's Republic of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]] using Soviet-dominated joint enterprises.

=== De-Stalinization and Khrushchev Thaw (1953–1964) ===
{{main|History of the Soviet Union (1953–1964)}}
[[File:John Kennedy, Nikita Khrushchev 1961.jpg|thumb|left|Soviet leader [[Nikita Khrushchev]] (left) with US President [[John F. Kennedy]] in Vienna, 3 June 1961]]
Stalin died on 5 March 1953. Without a mutually agreeable successor, the highest Communist Party officials initially opted to rule the Soviet Union jointly through a troika headed by [[Georgy Malenkov]]. This did not last, however, and [[Nikita Khrushchev]] eventually won the ensuing power struggle by the mid-1950s. In 1956, he [[On the Cult of Personality and Its Consequences|denounced Stalin's use of repression]] and proceeded to ease controls over the party and society. This was known as [[de-Stalinization]].

Moscow considered Eastern Europe to be a critically vital buffer zone for the forward defence of its western borders, in case of another major invasion such as the German invasion of 1941. For this reason, the USSR sought to cement its control of the region by transforming the Eastern European countries into satellite states, dependent upon and subservient to its leadership. Soviet military force was used to suppress anti-Stalinist uprisings in [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Hungary]] and [[Poznań 1956 protests|Poland]] in 1956.

In the late 1950s, a confrontation with China regarding the Soviet rapprochement with the West, and what [[Mao Zedong]] perceived as Khrushchev's [[Revisionism (Marxism)|revisionism]], led to the [[Sino–Soviet split]]. This resulted in a break throughout the global Marxist–Leninist movement, with the governments in [[People's Socialist Republic of Albania|Albania]], [[Democratic Kampuchea|Cambodia]] and [[Somali Democratic Republic|Somalia]] choosing to ally with China.

During this period of the late 1950s and early 1960s, the USSR continued to realize scientific and technological exploits in the [[Space Race]], rivaling the United States: launching the first artificial satellite, [[Sputnik 1]] in 1957; a living dog named [[Laika]] in 1957; the first human being, [[Yuri Gagarin]] in 1961; the first woman in space, [[Valentina Tereshkova]] in 1963; [[Alexei Leonov]], the first person to walk in space in 1965; the first soft landing on the Moon by spacecraft Luna 9 in 1966; and the first Moon rovers, [[Lunokhod 1]] and [[Lunokhod 2]].<ref name="lunokhod">{{cite episode|title=Tank on the Moon |series=The Nature of Things with David Suzuki |network=CBC-TV |airdate=6 December 2007 |url=http://www.cbc.ca/natureofthings/magazine2.html |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081226123643/http://www.cbc.ca/natureofthings/magazine2.html |archivedate=26 December 2008 }}</ref>

Khrushchev initiated "[[Khrushchev Thaw|The Thaw]]", a complex shift in political, cultural and economic life in the country. This included some openness and contact with other nations and new social and economic policies with more emphasis on commodity goods, allowing a dramatic rise in living standards while maintaining high levels of economic growth. Censorship was relaxed as well. Khrushchev's reforms in agriculture and administration, however, were generally unproductive. In 1962, he precipitated a [[Cuban Missile Crisis|crisis with the United States]] over the Soviet deployment of [[Nuclear weapons delivery|nuclear missiles]] in [[Cuba]]. An agreement was made with the United States to remove nuclear missiles from both Cuba and [[Turkey]], concluding the crisis. This event caused Khrushchev much embarrassment and loss of prestige, resulting in his removal from power in 1964.

=== Era of Stagnation (1964–1985) ===
{{main|History of the Soviet Union (1964–1982)|Era of Stagnation}}
[[File:Carter Brezhnev sign SALT II.jpg|thumb|left|Soviet General Secretary [[Leonid Brezhnev]] and US President [[Jimmy Carter]] sign the [[Strategic Arms Limitation Talks#SALT II|SALT II arms limitation treaty]] in [[Vienna]] on 18 June 1979]]
Following the ousting of Khrushchev, another period of [[collective leadership]] ensued, consisting of Leonid Brezhnev as General Secretary, [[Alexei Kosygin]] as Premier and [[Nikolai Podgorny]] as Chairman of the Presidium, lasting until Brezhnev established himself in the early 1970s as the preeminent Soviet leader.

In 1968, the Soviet Union and Warsaw Pact allies [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia|invaded]] [[Czechoslovakia]] to halt the [[Prague Spring]] reforms. In the aftermath, Brezhnev justified the invasion along with the earlier invasions of Eastern European states by introducing the [[Brezhnev Doctrine]], which claimed the right of the Soviet Union to violate the sovereignty of any country that attempted to replace Marxism–Leninism with capitalism.

Brezhnev presided throughout ''[[détente]]'' with the West that resulted in treaties on armament control ([[Strategic Arms Limitation Talks#SALT I Treaty|SALT I]], [[Strategic Arms Limitation Talks#SALT II|SALT II]], [[Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty]]) while at the same time building up Soviet military might.

In October 1977, the [[1977 Soviet Constitution|third Soviet Constitution]] was unanimously adopted. The prevailing mood of the Soviet leadership at the time of Brezhnev's death in 1982 was one of aversion to change. The long period of Brezhnev's rule had come to be dubbed one of "standstill"<!---застой--->, with an ageing and ossified top political leadership. This period is also known as the Era of Stagnation, a period of adverse economic, political, and social effects in the country, which began during the rule of Brezhnev and continued under his successors [[Yuri Andropov]] and [[Konstantin Chernenko]].

In late 1979, the Soviet Union's military intervened in the ongoing [[Afghanistan conflict (1978–present)|civil war in neighboring Afghanistan]], effectively ending a détente with the West.

=== Perestroika and Glasnost reforms (1985–1991) ===
{{main|Cold War (1985–1991)|History of the Soviet Union (1982–1991)|1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt}}

[[File:Image0 ST.jpg|thumb|[[T-80]] tank on [[Red Square]] during the [[1991 August Coup|August Coup]]]]
Two developments dominated the decade that followed: the increasingly apparent crumbling of the Soviet Union's economic and political structures, and the patchwork attempts at reforms to reverse that process. Kenneth S. Deffeyes argued in ''[[Beyond Oil]]'' that the [[Presidency of Ronald Reagan|Reagan administration]] encouraged [[Saudi Arabia]] to [[1980s oil glut|lower the price of oil]] to the point where the Soviets could not make a profit selling their oil, and resulted in the depletion of the country's [[hard currency]] reserves.<ref>Kenneth S. Deffeyes, Beyond Oil: The View from Hubbert's Peak.</ref>

Brezhnev's next two successors, transitional figures with deep roots in his tradition, did not last long. [[Yuri Andropov]] was 68 years old and [[Konstantin Chernenko]] 72 when they assumed power; both died in less than two years. In an attempt to avoid a third short-lived leader, in 1985, the Soviets turned to the next generation and selected [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]. He made significant changes in the economy and party leadership, called ''[[perestroika]]''. His policy of ''[[glasnost]]'' freed public [[access to information]] after decades of heavy government censorship. Gorbachev also moved to end the Cold War. In 1988, the USSR abandoned its [[Soviet–Afghan War|war in Afghanistan]] and began to withdraw its forces. In the following year, [[Sinatra Doctrine|Gorbachev refused to interfere in the internal affairs of the Soviet satellite states]], which paved the way for the [[Revolutions of 1989]]. With the tearing down of the [[Berlin Wall]] and with East and West Germany pursuing unification, the [[Iron Curtain]] between [[Western Bloc|the West]] and Soviet-controlled regions came down.

At the same time, the Soviet republics started legal moves towards potentially declaring [[sovereignty]] over their territories, citing the freedom to secede in Article 72 of the USSR constitution.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20050324050607/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1282/is_n12_v42/ai_9119705 The red blues — Soviet politics] by Brian Crozier, ''[[National Review]]'', 25 June 1990. {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> On 7 April 1990, a law was passed allowing a republic to secede if more than two-thirds of its residents voted for it in a referendum.<ref>[http://www.rspp.su/sobor/conf_2006/istoki_duh_nrav_crisis.html Origins of Moral-Ethical Crisis and Ways to Overcome it] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928104220/http://www.rspp.su/sobor/conf_2006/istoki_duh_nrav_crisis.html |date=28 September 2007 }} by V.A.Drozhin Honoured Lawyer of Russia.</ref> Many held their first free elections in the Soviet era for their own national legislatures in 1990. Many of these legislatures proceeded to produce legislation contradicting the Union laws in what was known as the "[[War of Laws]]". In 1989, the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russian SFSR]] convened a newly elected Congress of People's Deputies. [[Boris Yeltsin]] was elected its chairman. On 12 June 1990, the Congress [[Declaration of State Sovereignty of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|declared Russia's sovereignty over its territory]] and proceeded to pass laws that attempted to supersede some of the Soviet laws. After a landslide victory of [[Sąjūdis]] in Lithuania, that country declared its independence restored on 11 March 1990.

A [[1991 Soviet Union referendum|referendum for the preservation of the USSR]] was held on 17 March 1991 in nine republics (the remainder having boycotted the vote), with the majority of the population in those republics voting for preservation of the Union. The referendum gave Gorbachev a minor boost. In the summer of 1991, the [[Union of Sovereign States|New Union Treaty]], which would have turned the country into a much looser Union, was agreed upon by eight republics. The signing of the treaty, however, was interrupted by the [[1991 August Coup|August Coup]]—an attempted [[coup d'état]] by hardline members of the government and the KGB who sought to reverse Gorbachev's reforms and reassert the central government's control over the republics. After the coup collapsed, Yeltsin was seen as a hero for his decisive actions, while Gorbachev's power was effectively ended. The balance of power tipped significantly towards the republics. In August 1991, Latvia and Estonia immediately declared the restoration of their full independence (following Lithuania's 1990 example). Gorbachev resigned as general secretary in late August, and soon afterwards, the party's activities were indefinitely suspended—effectively ending its rule. By the fall, Gorbachev could no longer influence events outside Moscow, and he was being challenged even there by Yeltsin, who had been elected [[President of Russia]] in July 1991.

=== Dissolution and aftermath ===

The remaining 12 republics continued discussing new, increasingly looser, models of the Union. However, by December all except Russia and [[Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic|Kazakhstan]] had formally declared independence. During this time, Yeltsin took over what remained of the Soviet government, including the [[Moscow Kremlin]]. The final blow was struck on 1 December when Ukraine, the second-most powerful republic, [[1991 Ukrainian independence referendum|voted overwhelmingly for independence]]. Ukraine's secession ended any realistic chance of the country staying together even on a limited scale.

On 8 December 1991, the presidents of Russia, Ukraine and [[Belarus]] (formerly Byelorussia), signed the [[Belavezha Accords]], which declared the Soviet Union dissolved and established the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]] (CIS) in its place. While doubts remained over the authority of the accords to do this, on 21 December 1991, the representatives of all Soviet republics except [[Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic|Georgia]] signed the [[Alma-Ata Protocol]], which confirmed the accords. On 25 December 1991, Gorbachev resigned as the President of the USSR, declaring the office extinct. He turned the powers that had been vested in the presidency over to Yeltsin. That night, the Soviet flag was lowered for the last time, and the [[Flag of Russia|Russian tricolor]] was raised in its place.

The following day, the [[Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union|Supreme Soviet]], the highest governmental body, voted both itself and the country out of existence. This is generally recognized as marking the official, final [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] as a functioning state, and the end of the [[Cold War]].<ref>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Vt5OLD3vp4UC&q=26+december+1991+ussr&pg=PR5 | title=Russia and the Commonwealth of Independent States: Documents, Data, and Analysis| isbn=978-1-56324-637-1| last1=Brzezinski| first1=Zbigniew| last2=Brzezinski| first2=Zbigniew K| last3=Sullivan| first3=Paige| year=1997}}</ref> The Soviet Army initially remained under overall CIS command but was soon absorbed into the different military forces of the newly independent states. The few remaining Soviet institutions that had not been taken over by Russia ceased to function by the end of 1991.

Following the dissolution, Russia was internationally recognized<ref name="uk">[http://www.fco.gov.uk/servlet/Front?pagename=OpenMarket/Xcelerate/ShowPage&c=Page&cid=1007029394365&a=KCountryProfile&aid=1019744935436 Country Profile: Russia] Foreign & Commonwealth Office of the United Kingdom. {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080311123046/http://www.fco.gov.uk/servlet/Front?pagename=OpenMarket%2FXcelerate%2FShowPage&c=Page&cid=1007029394365&a=KCountryProfile&aid=1019744935436 |date=11 March 2008 }}</ref> as its [[Succession of states|legal successor]] on the international stage. To that end, Russia voluntarily accepted all Soviet foreign debt and claimed Soviet overseas properties as its own. Under the 1992 [[Lisbon Protocol]], Russia also agreed to receive all nuclear weapons remaining in the territory of other former Soviet republics. Since then, the Russian Federation has assumed the Soviet Union's rights and obligations. [[Ukraine]] has refused to recognize exclusive Russian claims to succession of the USSR and claimed such status for Ukraine as well, which was codified in Articles 7 and 8 of its 1991 law [[On Legal Succession of Ukraine]]. Since its independence in 1991, Ukraine has continued to pursue claims against Russia in foreign courts, seeking to recover its share of the foreign property that was owned by the USSR.

The dissolution was followed by a severe drop in economic and social conditions in [[post-Soviet states]],<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/966616.stm "Child poverty soars in eastern Europe"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110512034826/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/966616.stm |date=12 May 2011 }}, BBC News, 11 October 2000.</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Parenti|first=Michael|title=Blackshirts and Reds: Rational Fascism and the Overthrow of Communism|url=https://archive.org/details/blackshirtsredsr00pare|url-access=limited|date=1997|publisher=[[City Lights Bookstore|City Lights Books]]|isbn=978-0872863293|page=[https://archive.org/details/blackshirtsredsr00pare/page/n70 118]|author-link=Michael Parenti}}</ref> including a rapid increase in poverty,<ref name="Scheidel"/><ref>{{cite book|last1=McAaley|first1=Alastair|title=Russia and the Baltics: Poverty and Poverty Research in a Changing World|url=http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:8M3JFdbXA7sJ:www.crop.org/viewfile.aspx%3Fid%3D381+&cd=10&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=nz|accessdate=18 July 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170123224044/http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache%3A8M3JFdbXA7sJ%3Awww.crop.org%2Fviewfile.aspx%3Fid%3D381+&cd=10&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=nz|archive-date=23 January 2017|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=An epidemic of street kids overwhelms Russian cities|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/an-epidemic-of-street-kids-overwhelms-russian-cities/article4141933/|newspaper=The Globe and Mail|accessdate=17 July 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160828195036/http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/an-epidemic-of-street-kids-overwhelms-russian-cities/article4141933/|archive-date=28 August 2016|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Targ|first1=Harry|title=Challenging Late Capitalism, Neoliberal Globalization, & Militarism|date=2006}}</ref> crime,<ref>Theodore P.

==== Post-Soviet states ====
{{main|Post-Soviet states}}
The analysis of the [[succession of states]] for the 15 [[post-Soviet states]] is complex. The [[Russia|Russian Federation]] is seen as the legal ''continuator'' state and is for most purposes the heir to the Soviet Union. It retained ownership of all former Soviet embassy properties, as well as the old Soviet UN membership and permanent membership on the [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council]].

Of the two other co-founding states of the USSR at the time of the dissolution, [[Ukraine]] was the only one that had passed laws, similar to Russia, that it is a state-successor of both the [[Ukrainian SSR]] and the USSR.<ref>[https://zakon.rada.gov.ua/laws/main/1543-12 "ЗАКОН УКРАЇНИ Про правонаступництво України"] (in Ukrainian).</ref> Soviet treaties laid groundwork for Ukraine's future foreign agreements as well as they led to Ukraine agreeing to undertake 16.37% of debts of the Soviet Union for which it was going to receive its share of USSR's foreign property. Although it had a tough position at the time, due to Russia's position as a "single continuation of the USSR" that became widely accepted in the West as well as a constant pressure from the Western countries, allowed Russia to dispose state property of USSR abroad and conceal information about it. Due to that Ukraine never ratified "zero option" agreement that Russian Federation had signed with other former Soviet republics, as it denied disclosing of information about Soviet Gold Reserves and its Diamond Fund.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JSwstF6SEAkC&pg=PA924|title=The Former Soviet Union in Transition|page=924|editor1-first=Richard F.|editor1-last=Kaufman|editor2-first=John P.|editor2-last=Hardt|publisher=M.E.

What to do in this situation is an open question. Search for non-trivial solutions.

Similar situation occurred with restitution of cultural property. Although on 14 February 1992 Russia and other former Soviet republics signed agreement "On the return of cultural and historic property to the origin states" in [[Minsk]], it was halted by Russian State Duma that had eventually passed "[[Russian cultural property law|Federal Law on Cultural Valuables Displaced to the USSR as a Result of the Second World War and Located on the Territory of the Russian Federation]]" which made restitution currently impossible.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=https://cyberleninka.ru/article/n/istoriya-i-teoriya-restitutsii-kulturnyh-tsennostey|title=История и теория реституции культурных ценностей|first=Касатенко Александр|last=Николаевич|date=21 September 2013|journal=Вестник Таганрогского института управления и экономики|volume=1|issue=17|via=cyberleninka.ru}}</ref>

There are additionally four states that claim independence from the other internationally recognised post-Soviet states but [[List of states with limited recognition|possess limited international recognition]]: [[Abkhazia]], [[Nagorno-Karabakh]], [[South Ossetia]] and [[Transnistria]]. The [[Chechnya|Chechen]] separatist movement of the [[Chechen Republic of Ichkeria]] lacks any international recognition.

During his rule, Stalin always made the final policy decisions. Otherwise, Soviet foreign policy was set by the commission on the Foreign Policy of the Central Committee of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]], or by the party's highest body the [[Politburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Politburo]]. Operations were handled by the separate [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Soviet Union)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]]. It was known as the People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs (or Narkomindel), until 1946. The most influential spokesmen were [[Georgy Chicherin]] (1872–1936), [[Maxim Litvinov]] (1876–1951), [[Vyacheslav Molotov]] (1890–1986), [[Andrey Vyshinsky]] (1883–1954) and [[Andrei Gromyko]] (1909–1989).

* Comintern (1919–1943), or [[Communist International]], was an international communist organization based in the Kremlin that advocated [[world communism]].

Moscow was concerned about the [[Marshall Plan]], and Comecon was meant to prevent countries in the Soviets' sphere of influence from moving towards that of the Americans and Southeast Asia. Comecon was the Eastern Bloc's reply to the formation in Western Europe of the Organization for European Economic Co-Operation (OEEC),<ref name="loc-cs">"Germany (East)", Library of Congress Country Study, [http://memory.loc.gov/frd/cs/germany_east/gx_appnb.html Appendix B: The Council for Mutual Economic Assistance] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090501075842/http://memory.loc.gov/frd/cs/germany_east/gx_appnb.html |date=1 May 2009 }}</ref><ref>Michael C.

* The [[Cominform]] (1947–1956), informally the Communist Information Bureau and officially the Information Bureau of the Communist and Workers' Parties, was the first official agency of the international Marxist-Leninist movement since the dissolution of the Comintern in 1943. Its role was to coordinate actions between Marxist-Leninist parties under Soviet direction. Stalin used it to order Western European communist parties to abandon their exclusively parliamentarian line and instead concentrate on politically impeding the operations of the Marshall Plan.<ref>Michał Jerzy Zacharias, "The Beginnings of the Cominform: The Policy of the Soviet Union towards European Communist Parties in Connection with the Political Initiatives of the United States of America in 1947."

Its newspaper, ''For a Lasting Peace, for a People's Democracy!'', promoted Stalin's positions. The Cominform's concentration on Europe meant a deemphasis on world revolution in Soviet foreign policy. By enunciating a uniform ideology, it allowed the constituent parties to focus on personalities rather than issues.<ref>Heinz Timmermann,  "The cominform effects on Soviet foreign policy."

The Marxist-Leninist leadership of the Soviet Union intensely debated foreign policy issues and change directions several times. Even after Stalin assumed dictatorial control in the late 1920s, there were debates, and he frequently changed positions.<ref>Ulam, ''Expansion and Coexistence'' (1974) pp 111–79.</ref>

During the country's early period, it was assumed that Communist revolutions would break out soon in every major industrial country, and it was the Soviet responsibility to assist them. The [[Communist International|Comintern]] was the weapon of choice. A few revolutions did break out, but they were quickly suppressed (the longest lasting one was in Hungary)—the [[Hungarian Soviet Republic]]—lasted only from 21 March 1919 to 1 August 1919. The Russian Bolsheviks were in no position to give any help.

By 1921, Lenin, Trotsky, and Stalin realized that capitalism had stabilized itself in Europe and there would not be any widespread revolutions anytime soon. It became the duty of the Russian Bolsheviks to protect what they had in Russia, and avoid military confrontations that might destroy their bridgehead. Russia was now a pariah state, along with Germany. The two came to terms in 1922 with the [[Treaty of Rapallo, 1922|Treaty of Rapallo]] that settled long-standing grievances. At the same time, the two countries secretly set up training programs for the illegal German army and air force operations at hidden camps in the USSR.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 1986524|title = Rapallo Reexamined: A New Look at Germany's Secret Military Collaboration with Russia in 1922|journal = Military Affairs|volume = 40|issue = 3|pages = 109–117|last1 = Mueller|first1 = Gordon H.|year = 1976|doi = 10.2307/1986524}}</ref>

[[Moscow]] eventually stopped threatening other states, and instead worked to open peaceful relationships in terms of trade, and diplomatic recognition. The [[United Kingdom]] dismissed the warnings of [[Winston Churchill]] and a few others about a continuing Marxist-Leninist threat, and opened trade relations and ''de facto'' diplomatic recognition in 1922. There was hope for a settlement of the pre-war Tsarist debts, but it was repeatedly postponed.

In the late 1920s and early 1930s, Stalin ordered Marxist-Leninist parties across the world to strongly oppose non-Marxist political parties, labor unions or other organizations on the left. Stalin reversed himself in 1934 with the [[Popular Front]] program that called on all Marxist parties to join together with all [[Anti-fascism|anti-Fascist]] political, labor, and organizational forces that were opposed to [[fascism]], especially of the [[Nazism|Nazi]] variety.<ref>Chris Ward, ''Stalin's Russia'' (2nd ed. 1999) pp 148–88.</ref><ref>Barbara Jelavich, ''St.Petersburg and Moscow: Czarist and Soviet Foreign Policy, 1814–1974'' (1974) pp 342–46.</ref>

At the top of the Communist Party was the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Central Committee]], elected at [[Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Party Congresses]] and Conferences. In turn, the Central Committee voted for a [[Politburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Politburo]] (called the Presidium between 1952 and 1966), [[Secretariat of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Secretariat]] and the [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|General Secretary]] (First Secretary from 1953 to 1966), the ''de facto'' highest office in the Soviet Union.<ref>{{cite book|author=Law, David A.|title=Russian Civilization|publisher=Ardent Media|year=1975|pages=193–94|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f3ky9qBavl4C|isbn=978-0-8422-0529-0|access-date=20 June 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150512055909/http://books.google.com/books?id=f3ky9qBavl4C&dq|archive-date=12 May 2015|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Depending on the degree of power consolidation, it was either the Politburo as a collective body or the General Secretary, who always was one of the Politburo members, that effectively led the party and the country<ref>{{cite book|author=Zemtsov, Ilya|title=Chernenko: The Last Bolshevik: The Soviet Union on the Eve of Perestroika|publisher=[[Transaction Publishers]]|year=1989|page=325|url=https://archive.org/details/chernenkolastbol00zemt|url-access=registration|isbn=978-0-88738-260-4|access-date=20 June 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref> (except for the period of the highly personalized authority of Stalin, exercised directly through his position in the Council of Ministers rather than the Politburo after 1941).<ref>{{cite book|author=Knight, Amy|title=Beria: Stalin's First Lieutenant|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1995|page=5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PxiuUGRQhUIC|isbn=978-0-691-01093-9|access-date=20 June 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150512055028/http://books.google.com/books?id=PxiuUGRQhUIC&dq|archive-date=12 May 2015|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> They were not controlled by the general party membership, as the key principle of the party organization was [[democratic centralism]], demanding strict subordination to higher bodies, and elections went uncontested, endorsing the candidates proposed from above.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Hough, Jerry F.|author2=Fainsod, Merle|title=How the Soviet Union is Governed|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1979|page=486|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=38gMzMRXCpQC|isbn=978-0-674-41030-5|access-date=20 June 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150512054528/http://books.google.com/books?id=38gMzMRXCpQC&dq|archive-date=12 May 2015|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

The Communist Party maintained its dominance over the state mainly through its control over the [[Nomenklatura|system of appointments]]. All senior government officials and most deputies of the Supreme Soviet were members of the CPSU. Of the party heads themselves, Stalin (1941–1953) and Khrushchev (1958–1964) were Premiers. Upon the forced retirement of Khrushchev, the party leader was prohibited from this kind of double membership,<ref>{{cite book|author=Service, Robert|title=History of Modern Russia: From Tsarism to the Twenty-first Century|publisher=[[Penguin Books Ltd]]|year=2009|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o8Z1QAAACAAJ|isbn=978-0-14-103797-4|page=378|author-link=Robert Service (historian)|access-date=20 June 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511090135/http://books.google.com/books?id=o8Z1QAAACAAJ&dq|archive-date=11 May 2011|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> but the later General Secretaries for at least some part of their tenure occupied the mostly ceremonial position of [[List of heads of state of the Soviet Union|Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet]], the nominal [[List of heads of state of the Soviet Union|head of state]].

While nominally a union of equals, in practice the Soviet Union was dominated by [[Russians]]. The domination was so absolute that for most of its existence, the country was commonly (but incorrectly) referred to as "Russia". While the RSFSR was technically only one republic within the larger union, it was by far the largest (both in terms of population and area), most powerful, most developed, and the industrial center of the Soviet Union. Historian [[Matthew White (historian)|Matthew White]] wrote that it was an open secret that the country's federal structure was "window dressing" for Russian dominance. For that reason, the people of the USSR were usually called "Russians", not "Soviets", since "everyone knew who really ran the show".<ref>{{cite book|title=The Great Big Book of Horrible Things|last=White|first=Matthew|author-link=Matthew White (atrocitologist)|publisher=[[W.

Under the Military Law of September 1925, the [[Soviet Armed Forces]] consisted of three components, namely the [[Soviet Army|Land Forces]], the [[Soviet Air Forces|Air Force]], the [[Soviet Navy|Navy]], [[Joint State Political Directorate]] (OGPU), and the [[Internal Troops]].<ref>Scott and Scott, The Armed Forces of the Soviet Union, Westview Press, 1979, p.13</ref> The OGPU later became independent and in 1934 joined the [[NKVD]], and so its internal troops were under the joint leadership of the defense and internal commissariats. After World War II, [[Strategic Missile Forces]] (1959), [[Soviet Air Defence Forces|Air Defense Forces]] (1948) and National Civil Defense Forces (1970) were formed, which ranked first, third, and sixth in the official Soviet system of importance (ground forces were second, Air Force Fourth, and Navy Fifth).

The army had the greatest political influence. In 1989, there served two million soldiers divided between 150 motorized and 52 armored divisions. Until the early 1960s, the Soviet navy was a rather small military branch, but after the [[Caribbean crisis]], under the leadership of [[Sergei Gorshkov]], it expanded significantly. It became known for [[battlecruiser]]s and submarines. In 1989 there served 500 000 men. The [[Soviet Air Force]] focused on a fleet of [[strategic bomber]]s and during war situation was to eradicate enemy infrastructure and nuclear capacity. The air force also had a number of [[Fighter aircraft|fighter]]s and tactical bombers to support the army in the war. Strategic missile forces had more than 1,400 [[intercontinental ballistic missile]]s (ICBMs), deployed between 28 bases and 300 command centers.

In the post-war period, the Soviet Army was directly involved in several military operations abroad. These included the suppression of the [[East German uprising of 1953|uprising in East Germany]] (1953), [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Hungarian revolution]] (1956) and the [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia|invasion of Czechoslovakia]] (1968). The Soviet Union also participated in the [[Soviet–Afghan War|war in Afghanistan between 1979 and 1989]].

In the Soviet Union, general [[conscription]] applied.

At the end of the 1950s, with the help of engineers and technologies captured and imported from defeated [[Nazi Germany]], the Soviets constructed the first [[satellite]] - [[Sputnik 1]] and thus overtook the [[United States]]. This was followed by other successful satellites and experimental dogs were sent. On April 12, 1961, the first cosmonaut, [[Yuri Gagarin]], was sent to the space. He once flew around the Earth and successfully landed in the Kazakh steppe. At that time, the first plans for [[space shuttle]]s and orbital stations were drawn up in Soviet design offices, but in the end personal disputes between designers and management prevented this.

The first big fiasco for the USSR was the landing on the moon by the Americans, when the Russians were not able to respond to the Americans in time with the same project. In the 1970s, more specific proposals for the design of the space shuttle began to emerge, but shortcomings, especially in the electronics industry (rapid overheating of electronics), postponed the program until the end of the 1980s. The first shuttle, the [[Buran (spacecraft)|Buran]], flew in 1988, but without a human crew. Another shuttle, [[Ptichka]], eventually ended up under construction, as the shuttle project was canceled in [[1991]]. For their launch into space, there is today an unused superpower rocket, [[Energia]], which is the most powerful in the world.

In the late 1980s, the Soviet Union managed to build the [[Mir]] orbital station. It was built on the construction of [[Salyut programme|Salyut stations]] and its tasks were purely civilian and research. In the 1990s, when the US [[Skylab]] was shut down due to lack of funds, it was the only orbital station in operation. Gradually, other modules were added to it, including American ones. However, the technical condition of the station deteriorated rapidly, especially after the fire, so in 2001 it was decided to bring it into the atmosphere where it burned down.

The Soviet Union adopted a [[command economy]], whereby production and distribution of goods were centralized and directed by the government. The first Bolshevik experience with a command economy was the policy of [[War communism]], which involved the nationalization of industry, centralized distribution of output, coercive requisition of agricultural production, and attempts to eliminate money circulation, private enterprises and [[free trade]]. After the severe economic collapse, Lenin replaced war communism by the [[New Economic Policy]] (NEP) in 1921, legalizing free trade and private ownership of small businesses. The economy quickly recovered as a result.<ref name="gregory2004">{{cite book|author=Gregory, Paul R.|title=The Political Economy of Stalinism: Evidence from the Soviet Secret Archives|pages=218–20|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2004|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hFHU5kaXhu8C|isbn=978-0-521-53367-6|access-date=20 June 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150512042222/http://books.google.com/books?id=hFHU5kaXhu8C&dq|archive-date=12 May 2015|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

After a long debate among the members of the Politburo about the course of economic development, by 1928–1929, upon gaining control of the country, Stalin abandoned the NEP and pushed for full central planning, starting [[Collectivization in the Soviet Union|forced collectivization of agriculture]] and enacting draconian labor legislation.

From the 1930s until its dissolution in late 1991, the way the Soviet economy operated remained essentially unchanged. The economy was formally directed by [[economic planning|central planning]], carried out by [[Gosplan]] and organized in [[Five-year plans for the national economy of the Soviet Union|five-year plans]]. However, in practice, the plans were highly aggregated and provisional, subject to ''ad hoc'' intervention by superiors. All critical economic decisions were taken by the political leadership. Allocated resources and plan targets were usually denominated in [[Soviet ruble|rubles]] rather than in physical goods. [[Credit (finance)|Credit]] was discouraged, but widespread. The final allocation of output was achieved through relatively decentralized, unplanned contracting. Although in theory prices were legally set from above, in practice they were often negotiated, and informal horizontal links (e.g. between producer factories) were widespread.<ref name="gregory2004" />

A number of basic [[Service (economics)|services]] were state-funded, such as [[education in the Soviet Union|education]] and health care. In the manufacturing sector, heavy industry and defence were prioritized over [[Consumer goods in the Soviet Union|consumer goods]].<ref name="economy" /> Consumer goods, particularly outside large cities, were often scarce, of poor quality and limited variety. Under the command economy, consumers had almost no influence on production, and the changing demands of a population with growing incomes could not be satisfied by supplies at rigidly fixed prices.<ref name="hanson">Hanson, Philip.

The standard of living declined during the 1930s in response to Stalin's despotism, and after a brief improvement following his death, lapsed into stagnation. Glasnost and post-communist revelations interpreted as a whole thus provide no basis for Getty, Rittersporn & Zemskov's relatively favorable characterization of the methods, economic achievements and human costs of Stalinism.

In the case of the US, economic prioritization was being used for indigenous [[research and development]] as the means to acquire science and technology in both the private and public sectors. In contrast, the USSR was offensively and defensively maneuvering in the acquisition and utilization of the worldwide technology, to increase the competitive advantage that they acquired from the technology while preventing the US from acquiring a competitive advantage. However, technology-based planning was executed in a centralized, government-centric manner that greatly hindered its flexibility. This was exploited by the US to undermine the strength of the Soviet Union and thus foster its reform.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Global Tech Strategies Brought to U.S|journal=Washington Technology|date=3 May 1990|first=Margo|last=MacFarland}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|first=R.A.|last=Deckert|title=The science of uncovering industrial information|date=10 October 1990|work=Business Journal of the Treasure Coast}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=U.S. Firms Must Trade Short-Term Gains for Long-Term Technology Planning|date=7 March 1991|work=Inside the Pentagon}}</ref>

Transport was a vital component of the country's economy. The [[first five-year plan|economic centralization]] of the late 1920s and 1930s led to the development of infrastructure on a massive scale, most notably the establishment of [[Aeroflot]], an aviation [[Enterprises in the Soviet Union|enterprise]].<ref>{{cite book |author1=Highman, Robert D.S. |author2=Greenwood, John T. |author3=Hardesty, Von|title=Russian Aviation and Air Power in the Twentieth Century|publisher=Routledge|year=1998|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cpynoFM-Jf4C|isbn=978-0-7146-4784-5|page=134}}</ref> The country had a wide variety of modes of transport by land, water and air.<ref name=ciacom /> However, due to inadequate maintenance, much of the road, water and Soviet civil aviation transport were outdated and technologically backward compared to the First World.<ref name="twocerofive" />

Despite improvements, several aspects of the transport sector were still{{when|date=February 2016}} riddled with problems due to outdated infrastructure, lack of investment, corruption and bad decision-making.

The [[birth rate]] of the USSR decreased from 44.0 per thousand in 1926 to 18.0 in 1974, mainly due to increasing urbanization and the rising average age of marriages. The [[mortality rate]] demonstrated a gradual decrease as well – from 23.7 per thousand in 1926 to 8.7 in 1974. In general, the birth rates of the southern republics in Transcaucasia and Central Asia were considerably higher than those in the northern parts of the Soviet Union, and in some cases even increased in the post–World War II period, a phenomenon partly attributed to slower rates of urbanistion and traditionally earlier marriages in the southern republics.<ref name="GSE">{{cite book|author=Government of the USSR|script-title=ru:Большая советская энциклопедия |trans-title=[[Great Soviet Encyclopaedia]]|volume=24|page=15|year=1977|location=Moscow|publisher=[[State Committee for Publishing]]|language=Russian|author-link=Government of the USSR}}</ref> Soviet Europe moved towards [[sub-replacement fertility]], while [[Soviet Central Asia]] continued to exhibit population growth well above replacement-level fertility.<ref>{{cite book|author=Anderson, Barbara A. |title=Growth and Diversity of the Population of the Soviet Union|volume=510|pages=155–77 |year=1990|publisher=Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Sciences}}</ref>

Under Lenin, the state made explicit commitments to promote the equality of men and women. Many early Russian feminists and ordinary Russian working women actively participated in the Revolution, and many more were affected by the events of that period and the new policies. Beginning in October 1918,  Lenin's government liberalized divorce and abortion laws, decriminalized homosexuality (re-criminalized in the 1930s), permitted cohabitation, and ushered in a host of reforms.<ref>Wendy Z. Goldman, ''Women, the State and Revolution: Soviet Family Policy and Social Life, 1917–1936''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1993</ref> However, without [[birth control]], the new system produced many broken marriages, as well as countless out-of-wedlock children.<ref>Richard Stites, ''The Women's Liberation Movement in Russia: Feminism, Nihilism, and Bolshevism, 1860–1930'' (1978)</ref> The epidemic of divorces and extramarital affairs created social hardships when Soviet leaders wanted people to concentrate their efforts on growing the economy. Giving women control over their fertility also led to a precipitous decline in the birth rate, perceived as a threat to their country's military power. By 1936, Stalin reversed most of the liberal laws, ushering in a pronatalist era that lasted for decades.<ref>Rebecca Balmas Neary, "Mothering Socialist Society: The Wife-Activists' Movement and the Soviet Culture of Daily Life, 1934–1941," ''Russian Review'' (58) 3, July 1999: 396–412</ref>

Members of various ethnicities participated in legislative bodies. Organs of power like the Politburo, the Secretariat of the Central Committee etc., were formally ethnically neutral, but in reality, ethnic Russians were overrepresented, although there were also non-Russian leaders in the [[List of leaders of the Soviet Union|Soviet leadership]], such as [[Joseph Stalin]], [[Grigory Zinoviev]], [[Nikolai Podgorny]] or [[Andrei Gromyko]]. During the Soviet era, a significant number of ethnic Russians and Ukrainians migrated to other Soviet republics, and many of them settled there. According to the last census in 1989, the Russian "diaspora" in the Soviet republics had reached 25&nbsp;million.<ref>

In 1917, before the revolution, health conditions were significantly behind those of developed countries. As Lenin later noted, "Either the lice will defeat socialism, or socialism will defeat the lice".<ref name="lane">{{harvnb|Lane|1992|p=353}}</ref> The Soviet principle of health care was conceived by the [[Ministry of Health (Soviet Union)|People's Commissariat for Health]] in 1918. Health care was to be controlled by the state and would be provided to its citizens free of charge, a revolutionary concept at the time. Article 42 of the [[1977 Soviet Constitution]] gave all citizens the right to health protection and free access to any health institutions in the USSR. Before [[Leonid Brezhnev]] became General Secretary, the Soviet healthcare system was held in high esteem by many foreign specialists. This changed, however, from Brezhnev's accession and [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]'s tenure as leader, during which the health care system was heavily criticized for many basic faults, such as the quality of service and the unevenness in its provision.<ref>{{harvnb|Lane|1992|p=352}}</ref> [[Ministry of Health (Soviet Union)|Minister of Health]] [[Yevgeniy Chazov]], during the [[19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]], while highlighting such successes as having the most doctors and hospitals in the world, recognized the system's areas for improvement and felt that billions of [[Soviet ruble]]s were squandered.<ref>{{harvnb|Lane|1992|pp=352–53}}</ref> <!-- Billions in the previous line was prior milliard, but was changed according to [[WP:MOSNUM]].

After the revolution, life expectancy for all age groups went up. This statistic in itself was seen by some that the [[Socialist mode of production|socialist system]] was superior to the [[Capitalism|capitalist system]]. These improvements continued into the 1960s when statistics indicated that the life expectancy briefly surpassed that of the United States. Life expectancy started to decline in the 1970s, possibly because of [[Alcohol consumption in Russia|alcohol abuse]]. At the same time, infant mortality began to rise. After 1974, the government stopped publishing statistics on the matter. This trend can be partly explained by the number of pregnancies rising drastically in the Asian part of the country where infant mortality was the highest while declining markedly in the more developed European part of the Soviet Union.<ref name="SeemingParadox">{{cite journal|author= Dinkel, R.H. |title=The Seeming Paradox of Increasing Mortality in a Highly Industrialized Nation: the Example of the Soviet Union|journal=Population Studies|pages=155–77|year=1990|volume=39|issue=1|doi=10.1080/0032472031000141296|pmid=11611752}}</ref>

=== Language ===
{{main|Languages of the Soviet Union}}
Under Lenin, the government gave small language groups their own writing systems.<ref>{{harvnb|Comrie|1981|pp=3–4}}</ref> The development of these writing systems was highly successful, even though some flaws were detected. During the later days of the USSR, countries with the same [[Multilingualism|multilingual]] situation implemented similar policies. A serious problem when creating these writing systems was that the languages differed [[dialect]]ally greatly from each other.<ref>{{harvnb|Comrie|1981|p=4}}</ref> When a language had been given a writing system and appeared in a notable publication, it would attain "official language" status. There were many minority languages which never received their own writing system; therefore, their speakers were forced to have a [[second language]].<ref>{{harvnb|Comrie|1981|p=25}}</ref> There are examples where the government retreated from this policy, most notably under Stalin where education was discontinued in languages that were not widespread. These languages were then assimilated into another language, mostly Russian.<ref>{{harvnb|Comrie|1981|p=26}}</ref> During World War II, some minority languages were banned, and their speakers accused of collaborating with the enemy.<ref>{{harvnb|Comrie|1981|p=27}}</ref>

As the most widely spoken of the Soviet Union's many languages, Russian ''de facto'' functioned as an official language, as the "language of interethnic communication" ({{lang-ru|link=no|язык межнационального общения}}), but only assumed the ''[[de jure]]'' status as the official national language in 1990.<ref>{{cite web|script-title=ru:ЗАКОН СССР ОТ 24 April 1990 О ЯЗЫКАХ НАРОДОВ СССР|publisher=[[Government of the Soviet Union]]|date=24 April 1990|url=http://legal-ussr.narod.ru/data01/tex10935.htm|trans-title=Law of the USSR from 24 April 1990 on languages of the USSR|accessdate=24 October 2010|language=Russian|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160508201331/http://legal-ussr.narod.ru/data01/tex10935.htm|archive-date=8 May 2016|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

As for the Russian Orthodox Church, Soviet authorities sought to control it and, in times of national crisis, to exploit it for the regime's own purposes; but their ultimate goal was to eliminate it. During the first five years of Soviet power, the Bolsheviks executed 28 Russian Orthodox bishops and over 1,200 Russian Orthodox priests. Many others were imprisoned or exiled. Believers were harassed and persecuted. Most seminaries were closed, and the publication of most religious material was prohibited. By 1941, only 500 churches remained open out of about 54,000 in existence before World War I.

[[Council communists]] generally view the USSR as failing to create [[class consciousness]], turning into a corrupt state in which the elite controlled society. [[Anarchists]] are critical of the country, labeling the Soviet system as ''[[red fascism]]''. Soviets actively destroyed anarchist organizations and [[anarchist communities]], labeling anarchists as "enemies of the people". The Soviet invasion of the anarchist [[Free Territory]] and suppression of the anarchist [[Kronstadt rebellion]] and the [[Norilsk uprising]], in which prisoners created a radical system of government based on cooperatives and direct democracy in the [[Gulag]], led to animosity and hatred towards the USSR. Anarchist organizations and unions were also banned during the [[Spanish Civil War]] under the [[Republican faction (Spanish Civil War)|Republican]] government by orders from the Soviet government. Due to this, anarchists generally hold a large animosity towards the USSR.<ref>{{cite book|title=ABC of Anarchism|orig-year=1942|first=Alexander|last=Berkman|url=http://assets.zinedistro.org/zines/pdfs/116.pdf|publisher=Freedom Press|year=2006|isbn=0-900384-03-4|via=Zine Distro}}</ref>

The culture of the Soviet Union passed through several stages during the USSR's existence. During the first decade following the revolution, there was relative freedom and artists experimented with several different styles to find a distinctive Soviet style of art. Lenin wanted art to be accessible to the Russian people. On the other hand, hundreds of intellectuals, writers, and artists were exiled or executed, and their work banned, such as [[Nikolay Gumilyov]] who was shot for alleged conspiring against the Bolshevik regime, and [[Yevgeny Zamyatin]].<ref>'On the other hand...' See the index of ''Stalin and His Hangmen'' by Donald Rayfield, 2004, Random House</ref>

The government encouraged a variety of trends. In art and literature, numerous schools, some traditional and others radically experimental, proliferated. Communist writers [[Maxim Gorky]] and [[Vladimir Mayakovsky]] were active during this time. As a means of influencing a largely illiterate society, films received encouragement from the state, and much of director [[Sergei Eisenstein]]'s best work dates from this period.

During Stalin's rule, the Soviet culture was characterized by the rise and domination of the government-imposed style of [[socialist realism]], with all other trends being severely repressed, with rare exceptions, such as [[Mikhail Bulgakov]]'s works. Many writers were imprisoned and killed.<ref>{{harvnb|Rayfield|2004|pp=317–320}}</ref>

Following the [[Khrushchev Thaw]], censorship was diminished. During this time, a distinctive period of Soviet culture developed, characterized by conformist public life and an intense focus on personal life. Greater experimentation in art forms was again permissible, resulting in the production of more sophisticated and subtly critical work. The regime loosened its emphasis on socialist realism; thus, for instance, many protagonists of the novels of author [[Yury Trifonov]] concerned themselves with problems of daily life rather than with building socialism. Underground dissident literature, known as ''[[samizdat]]'', developed during this late period. In architecture, the Khrushchev era mostly focused on functional design as opposed to the highly decorated style of Stalin's epoch. In music, in response to the increasing popularity of forms of popular music like jazz in the West, many jazz orchestras were permitted throughout the USSR, notably the Melodiya Ensemble, named after the principle record label in the USSR.

In the second half of the 1980s, Gorbachev's policies of ''[[perestroika]]'' and ''[[glasnost]]'' significantly expanded [[freedom of expression]] throughout the country in the media and the press.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|title=Gorbachev, Mikhail|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica|date=2 October 2007|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9037405&gt|quotation="Under his new policy of glasnost ("openness"), a major cultural thaw took place: freedoms of expression and of information were significantly expanded; the press and broadcasting were allowed unprecedented candor in their reportage and criticism; and the country's legacy of Stalinist totalitarian rule was eventually completely repudiated by the government."|accessdate=1 December 2017}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

[[File:RR5110-0098R.png|thumb|[[Valeri Kharlamov]] represented the Soviet Union at 11 [[IIHF Men's World Championship|Ice Hockey World Championships]], winning eight gold medals, two silvers and one bronze]]
Founded on 20 July 1924 in Moscow, ''[[Sovetsky Sport]]'' was the first sports newspaper of the Soviet Union.

The [[Soviet Olympic Committee]] formed on 21 April 1951, and the [[International Olympic Committee|IOC]] recognized the new body in its [[List of IOC meetings|45th session]]. In the same year, when the Soviet representative Konstantin Andrianov became an IOC member, the USSR officially joined the [[Olympic Games#Olympic Movement|Olympic Movement]]. The [[1952 Summer Olympics]] in [[Helsinki]] thus became first Olympic Games for Soviet athletes.

The [[Soviet Union national ice hockey team]] won nearly every [[Ice Hockey World Championships|world championship]] and [[Ice hockey at the Olympic Games|Olympic tournament]] between 1954 and 1991 and never failed to medal in any [[International Ice Hockey Federation]] (IIHF) tournament in which they competed.

The advent{{when|date=January 2018}} of the state-sponsored "full-time amateur athlete" of the Eastern Bloc countries further eroded the ideology of the pure amateur, as it put the self-financed amateurs of the Western countries at a disadvantage. The Soviet Union entered teams of athletes who were all nominally students, soldiers, or working in a profession – in reality, the state paid many of these competitors to train on a full-time basis.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,976117-1,00.html|title=Traditions Pro Vs.

A 1989 report by a committee of the [[Australian Senate]] claimed that "there is hardly a medal winner at the Moscow Games, certainly not a gold medal winner...who is not on one sort of drug or another: usually several kinds.

A member of the IOC Medical Commission, Manfred Donike, privately ran additional tests with a new technique for identifying abnormal levels of testosterone by measuring its ratio to [[epitestosterone]] in [[urine]]. Twenty percent of the specimens he tested, including those from sixteen gold medalists, would have resulted in disciplinary proceedings had the tests been official. The results of Donike's unofficial tests later convinced the IOC to add his new technique to their testing protocols.<ref name="D.

Documentation obtained in 2016 revealed the Soviet Union's plans for a statewide doping system in [[track and field]] in preparation for the [[1984 Summer Olympics]] in Los Angeles. Dated before the decision to boycott the 1984 Games, the document detailed the existing steroids operations of the program, along with suggestions for further enhancements. Dr. Sergei Portugalov of the Institute for Physical Culture prepared the communication, directed to the Soviet Union's head of track and field. Portugalov later became one of the leading figures involved in the implementation of Russian doping before the 2016 Summer Olympics.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/14/sports/olympics/soviet-doping-plan-russia-rio-games.html?_r=0|date=13 August 2016|first=Rebecca R.|last=Ruiz|website=nytimes.com|title=The Soviet Doping Plan: Document Reveals Illicit Approach to '84 Olympics|accessdate=15 January 2018|quote=The document – obtained by The New York Times from a former chief medical doctor for Soviet track and field – was signed by Dr. Sergei Portugalov, a Soviet sports doctor who went on to capitalize on a growing interest in new methods of doping.

== Environment ==
[[File:AralSea1989 2014.jpg|thumb|left|One of the many impacts of the approach to the environment in the USSR is the [[Aral Sea]] (see status in 1989 and 2014)]]
[[File:Karabash mountain.jpg|thumb|right|Landscape near [[Karabash, Chelyabinsk Oblast]], an area that was previously covered with forests until acid rainfall from a nearby copper smelter killed all vegetation]]{{More citations needed section|date=October 2020}}
Official Soviet environmental policy has always attached great importance to actions in which human beings actively improve nature. Lenin's quote "Communism is Soviet power and electrification of the country!" in many respects summarizes the focus on modernization and industrial development. During the first five-year plan in 1928, Stalin proceeded to industrialize the country at all costs. Values such as environmental and nature protection have been completely ignored in the struggle to create a modern industrial society. After Stalin's death, they focused more on environmental issues, but the basic perception of the value of environmental protection remained the same.<ref name="Ziegler">{{Cite journal | author= Ziegler, Charles E. | title= Soviet Images of the Environment | journal    = British Journal of Political Science | language= | date=July 1985 | volume=15 | issue=3 | pages=365–380 | doi= 10.1017/S0007123400004233 | jstor= 193698 }}</ref>

The Soviet media has always focused on the vast expanse of land and the virtually indestructible natural resources. This made it feel that contamination and uncontrolled exploitation of nature were not a problem. The Soviet state also firmly believed that scientific and technological progress would solve all the problems. Official ideology said that under socialism environmental problems could easily be overcome, unlike capitalist countries, where they seemingly could not be solved. The Soviet authorities had an almost unwavering belief that man could transcend nature. However, when the authorities had to admit that there were [[Ecology|environmental problems]] in the USSR in the 1980s, they explained the problems in such a way that socialism had not yet been fully developed; pollution in a socialist society was only a temporary anomaly that would have been resolved if socialism had developed.{{citation needed|date=July 2020}}

The [[Chernobyl disaster]] in 1986 was the first major accident at a civilian [[nuclear power plant]]. Unparalleled in the world, it resulted in a large number of radioactive isotopes being released into the atmosphere. Radioactive doses have scattered relatively far. 4,000 new cases of thyroid cancer were reported after the incident, but this led to a relatively low number of deaths (WHO data, 2005).{{Citation needed|date=October 2020}} However, the long-term effects of the accident are unknown. Another major accident is the [[Kyshtym disaster]].<ref>{{cite journal | author= Baverstock, Keith; Williams, Dillwyn | title= The Chernobyl Accident 20 Years on: An Assessment of the Health Consequences and the International Response | journal = Environmental Health Perspectives | date=2006 | volume=114 | issue=9 | pages=1312–1317 | doi=10.1289/ehp.9113| pmid= 16966081 | pmc= 1570049 }}</ref>

After the [[fall of the USSR]], it was discovered that the environmental problems were greater than what the Soviet authorities admitted. The [[Kola Peninsula]] was one of the places with clear problems. Around the industrial cities of [[Monchegorsk]] and [[Norilsk]], where [[nickel]], for example, is mined, all forests have been destroyed by contamination, while the northern and other parts of Russia have been affected by emissions. During the 1990s, people in the West were also interested in the radioactive hazards of nuclear facilities, decommissioned [[nuclear submarine]]s, and the processing of [[nuclear waste]] or [[spent nuclear fuel]]. It was also known in the early 1990s that the USSR had transported radioactive material to the [[Barents Sea]] and [[Kara Sea]], which was later confirmed by the Russian parliament. The crash of the [[K-141 Kursk]] submarine in 2000 in the west further raised concerns.<ref>{{Cite journal | author= Hønneland, Geir og Jørgensen, Anne-Kristin | title= Implementing Russia's International Environmental Commitments: Federal Prerogative or Regional Concern? | journal = Europe-Asia Studies | date=December 2002 | volume=54 | issue=8 | pages=1223–1240 | doi= 10.1080/0966813022000025862 | jstor= 826384 | s2cid= 156340249 }}</ref> In the past, there were accidents involving submarines [[Soviet submarine K-19|K-19]], [[Soviet submarine K-8|K-8]], and [[Soviet submarine K-129 (1960)|K-129]].{{citation needed|date=July 2020}}
