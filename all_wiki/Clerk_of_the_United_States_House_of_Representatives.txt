The '''Clerk of the United States House of Representatives''' is an officer of the [[United States House of Representatives]], whose primary duty is to act as the chief record-keeper for the House.

Along with the other House officers, the Clerk is elected every two years when the House organizes for a new Congress. The majority and minority caucuses nominate candidates for the House officer positions after the election of the [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker]]. The full House adopts a resolution to elect the officers, who will begin serving after they have taken the [[oath of office]].

The clerk is [[Cheryl L. Johnson]], of [[Louisiana]]. She replaced [[Karen Haas]] at the beginning of the [[116th Congress]]. [[Robert Reeves (politician)|Robert Reeves]] is Deputy Clerk and [[Gigi Kelaher]] is Senior Advisor to the Clerk.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://clerk.house.gov/about|title=Office of the Clerk of the U.S. House of Representatives|website=Clerk.house.gov|accessdate=May 7, 2018|url-status=live |archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20110221020934/http://clerk.house.gov/about|archivedate=February 21, 2011}}</ref> On December 29, 2018, Democratic Leader [[Nancy Pelosi]] named Cheryl Johnson to succeed Haas as Clerk.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollcall.com/news/politics/pelosi-names-cheryl-johnson-to-be-house-clerk|title=Pelosi Names Cheryl Johnson to Be House Clerk|website=Rollcall.com|date=2018-12-28|accessdate=2020-03-18}}</ref> Johnson was elected by the House of Representatives on February 25, 2019, as per House Resolution 143 and took the oath of office shortly after the passage of the resolution on the same day.

==Duties==
{{United States House of Representatives}}

===Organization of House===
Every two years regular congressional elections are held. Only one-third of [[United States Senate|Senators']] terms expire at each of these elections, but the terms of office of the entire House end. The Senate has remained in constant existence since it first went into [[1st United States Congress|session in 1789]] but the House goes out of existence (and hence a "new" Congress takes office) every two years.

To preserve the legal continuity of the House, the existence of the House is vested in the Clerk at the end of each two-year term. Thus, when the newly elected members of the House gather on January 3, it is the Clerk of the previous House who summons Representatives and convenes the new Congress for the first time. Accordingly, the Clerk calls the House to order by [[gavel]]ing it into session.  After a prayer and the Pledge of Allegiance, the clerk then calls the roll of representatives-elect, which is done as an electronic quorum call in the modern era, and then oversees the election of a Speaker. During these processes, the Clerk must "preserve order and decorum and decide all questions of order," which is subject to appeal.<ref name=CRSFirstDay>Congressional Research Service, The First Day of a New Congress: A Guide to Proceedings on the House Floor, rev. Dec. 19, 2018, [https://www.everycrsreport.com/files/20181219_RL30725_45e6fed3e44b9356413ddaab18565a4a43b1f3dc.pdf].</ref>

The Speaker is then sworn in, takes the chair, administers oaths to the rest of the of members-elect, and the House then proceeds with other business (which includes electing a Clerk for the new session). Were the House not to vest such personality in the Clerk of the previous House, there would be no authority empowered to convene the session and lead the House in its first few acts.

====Disputes in 19th century====
In the 19th century, the power of the preceding House Clerk to organize the House played a significant role at the beginning of several congresses.<ref name=jenkinsstewart>Jeffrey Jenkins and Charles Stewart III, More than Just a Mouthpiece: The House Clerk as Party Operative, 1789-1870, Manuscript, 2005, available at [https://cpb-us-e1.wpmucdn.com/sites.usc.edu/dist/2/77/files/2018/01/Clerk-Paper-v6-1ggx4ph.pdf].</ref> Following the 1838 elections, at the first meeting of the [[26th Congress]] in December 1839, House Clerk Hugh Garland omitted the names of five Whigs from New Jersey from the roll call.  After days of debate, the Whigs were not seated, effectively creating a Democratic majority in a closely divided House.  Only then was the roll call completed and a Speaker elected.<ref name=jenkinsstewart />{{rp|15-17}}

In 1863, at the beginning of the [[38th Congress]] during the Civil War, House Clerk [[Emerson Etheridge]] called the roll, excluding 16 members from five pro-Union states (Maryland, Missouri, West Virginia, Kansas, and Oregon) while including three members from Louisiana.<ref name=jenkinsstewart />{{rp|24}}  The effort failed, a motion was made to add the missing delegations, and a Speaker was then elected.<ref name=jenkinsstewart />{{rp|25}}  [[Edward McPherson]] was then elected to replace Etheridge as Clerk for the 38th Congress.

Two years later, in December 1865 as the path of [[Reconstruction era | Reconstruction]] was being determined, McPherson omitted the names of members-elect from Tennessee, Virginia, and Louisiana from the roll for the [[39th Congress]], and allowed no interference or interruption during his call.  After heated debate, in which a member-elect from Tennessee tried to gain floor recognition but was denied, a motion was made by [[Thaddeus Stevens]] to proceed to the election of Speaker, which was eventually agreed to.<ref name=jenkinsstewart />{{rp|26-27}}  This enabled the [[Radical Republicans]] to firmly control Congress, ultimately imposing stricter conditions on readmission of Southern states and enabling Congress to override many vetoes from President [[Andrew Johnson]].

===Other duties===

Federal law requires the Clerk to notify each state government of the [[United States congressional apportionment|number of seats apportioned]] to the state no later than January 25 of the year immediately following each [[decennial]] [[United States Census|census]].

Rule II of the [[Procedures of the United States House of Representatives|House Rules]] requires the Clerk to:
* prepare the roll of Members-elect.
* call the Members-elect to order at the commencement of each Congress; to call the roll of Members-elect, and, pending the election of the Speaker, to preserve order and decorum; and to decide all questions of order.
* prepare and distribute at the beginning of every session a list of reports required to be made to Congress.
* note all questions of order, and decisions thereon, and to print these as an appendix to the Journal of each session of the House.
* prepare and print the [[United States House Journal|House Journal]] after each session of Congress, and to distribute the Journal to Members and to the [[Governor (United States)|executive]] and the [[State legislature (United States)|legislature of each State]].
* attest and affix the seal of the House to all writs, warrants, and subpoenas and formal documents issued by the House.
* certify the passage by the House of all bills and joint resolutions.
* receive messages from the President and the Senate when the House is not in session.
* prepare and deliver messages to the Senate and otherwise as requested by the House.
* retain, in the official library, a permanent set of the books and documents generated by the House.
* manage the office and supervise the staff of any vacant Member (the vacancy may have occurred by [[Expulsion from the United States Congress|expulsion]], [[resignation]], or death) until a [[List of special elections to the United States House of Representatives|successor is elected]].

In addition, the Clerk:
* acts as custodian of all noncurrent records of the House, pursuant to Rule VII.
* is responsible, under the supervision and direction of the U.S. House of Representatives Fine Arts Board, for the administration, maintenance, and display of the works of fine art and other similar property of the Congress for display or for other use in the House wing of the Capitol, the House Office Buildings, or any other location under the control of the House (P.L. 100-696). In addition, pursuant to the rules of the [[United States Capitol Preservation Commission]], the Clerk may be asked to provide staff support and assistance to the commission.

== History ==
On April 1, 1789, the House of Representatives convened with its first quorum. Its initial order of business was the election of the Speaker, [[Frederick Augustus Conrad Muhlenberg]], a Representative from Pennsylvania. The next order of business was the election of the Clerk, [[John Beckley]], a citizen of Virginia. Although the Clerk's title is derived from that of the Clerk of the [[British House of Commons]], the duties are similar to those prescribed for the [[Charles Thomson|Secretary of the Continental Congress]] in March 1785.

In addition to the duties involved in organizing the House and presiding over its activities at the commencement of each Congress, the Clerk is charged with a number of legislative functions; some of these, such as the constitutional requirement of maintaining the [[House Journal]], have existed from the time of the [[First United States Congress|first Congress]], whereas others have been added over the years because of changes in procedure and organization.
