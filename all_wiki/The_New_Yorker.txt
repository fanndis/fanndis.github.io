'''''The New Yorker''''' is an American weekly magazine featuring [[journalism]], commentary, criticism, essays, fiction, [[satire]], cartoons, and poetry. Started as a weekly in 1925, the magazine is now published 47 times annually, with five of these issues covering two-week spans. Although its reviews and events listings often focus on the [[Culture of New York City|cultural life of New York City]], ''The New Yorker'' has a wide audience outside New York and is read internationally. It is well known for its illustrated and often topical covers,<ref>{{cite web|last1=Temple|first1=Emily|title=20 Iconic New Yorker Covers from the Last 93 Years|date=February 21, 2018|url=https://lithub.com/20-iconic-new-yorker-covers/|publisher=Literary Hub|access-date=February 23, 2018}}</ref> its commentaries on [[popular culture]] and eccentric [[Americana]], its attention to modern [[fiction]] by the inclusion of [[Short story|short stories]] and literary [[review]]s, its rigorous [[Fact-checking|fact checking]] and [[copy editing]],<ref>{{cite news |last1=Norris |first1=Mary |author-link1=Mary Norris (copy editor) |title=How I proofread my way to Philip Roth's heart |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/may/10/between-you-and-me-confessions-of-a-comma-queen-mary-norris-extract |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |access-date=July 12, 2018 |language=en |date=May 10, 2015 |quote=It has been more than 20 years since I became a page OK'er—a position that exists only at the ''New Yorker'', where you query-proofread pieces and manage them, with the editor, the author, a fact-checker, and a second proofreader, until they go to press.}}</ref><ref name="TED Talk">{{cite web|title=Mary Norris: The nit-picking glory of the New Yorker's comma queen|url=http://www.ted.com/talks/mary_norris_the_nit_picking_glory_of_the_new_yorker_s_comma_queen|publisher=[[TED (conference)|TED]]|access-date=July 12, 2018|quote=Copy editing for The New Yorker is like playing shortstop for a major league baseball team—every little movement gets picked over by the critics [...] [[E.

== History ==
''The New Yorker'' was founded by [[Harold Ross]] and his wife [[Jane Grant]], a ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' reporter, and debuted on February 21, 1925. Ross wanted to create a sophisticated humor magazine that would be different from perceivably "corny" humor publications such as ''[[Judge (magazine)|Judge]]'', where he had worked, or the old ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]''. Ross partnered with entrepreneur Raoul H. Fleischmann (who founded the General Baking Company<ref>[https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/timeline Newyorker.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131107183533/http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/timeline |date=November 7, 2013 }}</ref>) to establish the F-R Publishing Company. The magazine's first offices were at 25 West 45th Street in [[Manhattan]]. Ross edited the magazine until his death in 1951. During the early, occasionally precarious years of its existence, the magazine prided itself on its cosmopolitan sophistication. Ross famously declared in a 1925 prospectus for the magazine: "It has announced that it is not edited for the old lady in [[Dubuque, Iowa|Dubuque]]."<ref>[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9500E2D81730F936A3575BC0A96F958260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=1 ''Dubuque Journal; The Slight That Years, All 75, Can't Erase''], Dirk Johnson, ''[[The New York Times]]'', August 5, 1999.</ref>

Although the magazine never lost its touches of humor, it soon established itself as a pre-eminent forum for serious [[fiction]], [[essays]] and journalism. Shortly after the end of [[World War II]], [[John Hersey]]'s essay ''[[Hiroshima (book)|Hiroshima]]'' filled an entire issue. In subsequent decades the magazine published short stories by many of the most respected writers of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, including [[Ann Beattie]], [[Sally Benson]], [[Truman Capote]], [[John Cheever]], [[Roald Dahl]], [[Mavis Gallant]], [[Geoffrey T. Hellman|Geoffrey Hellman]], [[Ruth McKenney]], [[John McNulty (journalist)|John McNulty]], [[Joseph Mitchell (writer)|Joseph Mitchell]], [[Alice Munro]], [[Haruki Murakami]], [[Vladimir Nabokov]], [[John O'Hara]], [[Dorothy Parker]], [[S.J. Perelman]], [[Philip Roth]], [[J. D. Salinger]], [[Irwin Shaw]], [[James Thurber]], [[John Updike]], [[Eudora Welty]], [[Stephen King]], and [[E. B. White]]. Publication of [[Shirley Jackson]]'s "[[The Lottery]]" drew more mail than any other story in the magazine's history.<ref name="Lottery letters">{{cite web | title= 'The Lottery' Letters |url= https://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/the-lottery-letters | last= Franklin | first= Ruth| date= June 25, 2013| website= www.newyorker.com |publisher= [[Condé Nast]]| access-date= June 11, 2018 }}</ref>

In its early decades, the magazine sometimes published two or even three short stories a week, but in recent years the pace has remained steady at one story per issue. While some styles and themes recur more often than others in its fiction, the stories are marked less by uniformity than by variety, and they have ranged from Updike's introspective domestic narratives to the surrealism of [[Donald Barthelme]], and from parochial accounts of the lives of neurotic New Yorkers to stories set in a wide range of locations and eras and translated from many languages.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} [[Kurt Vonnegut]] said that ''The New Yorker'' has been an effective instrument for getting a large audience to appreciate modern literature. Vonnegut's 1974 interview with Joe David Bellamy and John Casey contained a discussion of ''The New Yorker''{{'}}s influence:

{{quote|[T]he limiting factor [in literature] is the reader. No other art requires the audience to be a performer. You have to count on the reader's being a good performer, and you may write music which he absolutely can't perform—in which case it's a bust. Those writers you mentioned and myself are teaching an audience how to play this kind of music in their heads. It's a learning process, and ''The New Yorker'' has been a very good institution of the sort needed. They have a captive audience, and they come out every week, and people finally catch on to Barthelme, for instance, and are able to perform that sort of thing in their heads and enjoy it.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Vonnegut |first=Kurt |editor1-last=Allen |editor1-first=William Rodney |year=1988 |title=Conversations with Kurt Vonnegut |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bLQeOR_m2YMC&pg=PA164 |location=Jackson, MI |publisher=University Press of Mississippi |pages=163–164 |isbn=9780878053575 }}</ref>}}

The non-fiction feature articles (which usually make up the bulk of the magazine's content) cover an eclectic array of topics. Recent{{when|date= June 2018}} subjects have included eccentric evangelist [[Creflo Dollar]], the different ways in which humans perceive the passage of time, and [[Münchausen syndrome by proxy]].

The magazine is notable for its editorial traditions. Under the rubric ''Profiles'', it publishes articles about notable people such as [[Ernest Hemingway]], [[Henry Luce|Henry R. Luce]] and [[Marlon Brando]], Hollywood restaurateur [[Michael Romanoff]], magician [[Ricky Jay]] and mathematicians [[Chudnovsky brothers|David and Gregory Chudnovsky]]. Other enduring features have been "Goings on About Town", a listing of cultural and entertainment events in New York, and "The Talk of the Town", a miscellany of brief pieces—frequently humorous, whimsical or eccentric vignettes of life in New York—written in a breezily light style, or [[feuilleton]], although in recent years the section often begins with a serious commentary. For many years, newspaper snippets containing amusing errors, unintended meanings or badly mixed metaphors ("Block That Metaphor") have been used as filler items, accompanied by a witty retort. There is no masthead listing the editors and staff. Despite some changes, the magazine has kept much of its traditional appearance over the decades in typography, layout, covers and artwork. The magazine was acquired by [[Advance Publications]], the media company owned by [[Samuel Irving Newhouse Jr.|Samuel Irving Newhouse Jr]], in 1985,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fM4yPDNHtHQC&q=1984+newhouse+the+new+yorker&pg=PA58|last=Easley|first=Greg|work=[[Spy (magazine)|Spy]]|title=The New Yorker: When a Magazine Wins Awards But Loses Money, the Only Success is the Editor's Private One|date=October 1995|access-date=July 31, 2015}}</ref> for $200&nbsp;million when it was earning less than $6&nbsp;million a year.<ref name="mahon19890910">{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/09/10/magazine/si-newhouse-and-conde-nast-taking-off-the-white-gloves.html?pagewanted=all |title=S.I.

Ross was succeeded as editor by [[William Shawn]] (1951–87), followed by [[Robert Gottlieb]] (1987–92) and [[Tina Brown]] (1992–98). Among the important nonfiction authors who began writing for the magazine during Shawn's editorship were [[Dwight Macdonald]], [[Kenneth Tynan]], and [[Hannah Arendt]]; to a certain extent all three authors were controversial, Arendt the most obviously so{{according to whom|date= June 2018}} (her ''Eichmann in Jerusalem'' reportage appeared in the magazine before it was published as a book), but in each case Shawn proved an active champion.

Brown's nearly six-year tenure attracted more controversy than Gottlieb's or even Shawn's, thanks to her high profile (Shawn, by contrast, had been an extremely shy, introverted figure) and the changes which she made to a magazine that had retained a similar look and feel for the previous half-century. She introduced color to the editorial pages (several years before ''[[The New York Times]]'') and photography, with less type on each page and a generally more modern layout. More substantively, she increased the coverage of current events and hot topics such as celebrities and business tycoons, and placed short pieces throughout "Goings on About Town", including a racy column about nightlife in Manhattan. A new letters-to-the-editor page and the addition of authors' bylines to their "Talk of the Town" pieces had the effect of making the magazine more personal. The current editor of ''The New Yorker'' is [[David Remnick]], who succeeded Brown in July 1998.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Harper |first=Jennifer |date=July 13, 1998 |title=New Yorker Magazine Names New Editor |url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-20900047.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171010075840/https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-20900047.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=October 10, 2017 |newspaper=The Washington Times |agency=Knight Ridder/Tribune Business News |access-date=December 22, 2016 }}{{Subscription required|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}</ref>

[[Tom Wolfe]] wrote about the magazine: "The ''New Yorker'' style was one of leisurely meandering understatement, droll when in the humorous mode, tautological and litotical when in the serious mode, constantly amplified, qualified, adumbrated upon, nuanced and renuanced, until the magazine's pale-gray pages became High Baroque triumphs of the relative clause and appository modifier".<ref>Tom Wolfe, "Foreword: Murderous Gutter Journalism", in ''Hooking Up''. New York: Farrar Straus Giroux, 2000.</ref>

Joseph Rosenblum, reviewing [[Ben Yagoda]]'s ''About Town'', a history of the magazine from 1925 to 1985, wrote, "...{{nbsp}}''The New Yorker'' did create its own universe. As one longtime reader wrote to Yagoda, this was a place 'where [[Peter DeVries]] ...{{sic}} was forever lifting a glass of [[Piesporter]], where [[Niccolò Tucci]] (in a plum velvet [[dinner jacket]]) flirted in Italian with [[Muriel Spark]], where Nabokov sipped tawny [[Port wine|port]] from a prismatic goblet (while a [[Vanessa atalanta|Red Admirable]] perched on his pinky), and where John Updike tripped over the master's Swiss shoes, excusing himself charmingly{{' "}}.<ref>{{cite book |last= Rosenblum |first= Joseph |chapter= About Town |editor= Wilson, John D. |editor2=[[Steven G.

As far back as the 1940s, the magazine's commitment to [[Fact checker|fact-checking]] was already well-known.<ref>{{cite book|title=About Town: The New Yorker and the World It Made|first=Ben|last=Yagoda|publisher=Da Capo Press|year=2001|isbn=978-0-306-81023-7|pages=[https://archive.org/details/abouttown00beny/page/202 202–3]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/abouttown00beny/page/202}}</ref> However, the magazine played a role in a literary scandal and defamation lawsuit over two articles written by [[Janet Malcolm]] in the 1990s, who wrote about [[Sigmund Freud]]'s legacy.

Since the late 1990s, ''The New Yorker'' has used the Internet to publish current and archived material, and maintains a website with some content from the current issue (plus exclusive web-only content). Subscribers have access to the full current issue online, as well as a complete archive of back issues viewable as they were originally printed. In addition, ''The New Yorker''{{'}}s cartoons are available for purchase online. A digital archive of back issues from 1925 to April 2008 (representing more than 4,000 issues and half a million pages) has also been issued on DVD-ROMs and on a small portable hard drive. More recently, an iPad version of the current issue of the magazine has been released.

In its issue dated November 1, 2004, the magazine endorsed a presidential candidate for the first time, choosing to endorse [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[John Kerry]] over incumbent [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[George W. Bush]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2004/11/01/the-choice-5|title=The Choice}}</ref> This was continued in 2008, when the magazine endorsed [[Barack Obama]] over [[John McCain]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2008/10/13/the-choice-the-editors|title=The Choice}}</ref> in 2012, when it endorsed Obama over [[Mitt Romney]],<ref>[https://www.newyorker.com/talk/comment/2012/10/29/121029taco_talk_editors "The Talk of the Town"] (October 29 and November 5, 2012).</ref> and in 2016, when it endorsed [[Hillary Clinton]] over [[Donald Trump]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/10/31/the-new-yorker-endorses-hillary-clinton|title=The New Yorker Endorses Hillary Clinton|website=The New Yorker|access-date=November 17, 2016}}</ref>

=== Influence ===
''The New Yorker'' influenced a number of similar magazines, including [[The Brooklynite (magazine)|''The Brooklynite'']] (1926 to 1930), ''[[The Chicagoan]]'' (1926 to 1935), and Paris's ''[[The Boulevardier]]'' (1927 to 1932).<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/definingnewyorke00leej|url-access=registration|page=[https://archive.org/details/definingnewyorke00leej/page/12 12]|quote=brooklynite .|title=Defining New Yorker Humor|last=Lee|first=Judith Yaross|date=2000|publisher=Univ.

== Cartoons ==
''The New Yorker'' has featured cartoons (usually [[gag cartoon]]s) since it began publication in 1925. The cartoon editor of ''The New Yorker'' for years was [[Lee Lorenz]], who first began cartooning in 1956 and became a ''New Yorker'' contract contributor in 1958.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.newyorker.com/contributors/lee-lorenz|title=Lee Lorenz|work=The New Yorker|access-date=July 31, 2015}}</ref> After serving as the magazine's art editor from 1973 to 1993 (when he was replaced by [[Françoise Mouly]]), he continued in the position of cartoon editor until 1998. His book ''The Art of the New Yorker: 1925–1995'' (Knopf, 1995) was the first comprehensive survey of all aspects of the magazine's graphics. In 1998, [[Robert Mankoff]] took over as cartoon editor and edited at least 14 collections of ''New Yorker'' cartoons. In addition, Mankoff usually contributed a short article to each book, describing some aspect of the cartooning process or the methods used to select cartoons for the magazine. Mankoff left the magazine in 2017.<ref>Cavna, Michael. [https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/comic-riffs/wp/2017/05/01/bob-mankoff-named-humor-editor-for-esquire-after-exiting-new-yorker-job/ "Bob Mankoff named humor editor for Esquire one day after exiting the New Yorker,"] ''Washington Post'' (May 1, 2017).</ref>

''The New Yorker''{{'}}s stable of cartoonists has included many important talents in American humor, including [[Charles Addams]], [[Peter Arno]], [[Charles Barsotti]], [[George Booth (cartoonist)|George Booth]], [[Roz Chast]], [[Tom Cheney (cartoonist)|Tom Cheney]], [[Sam Cobean]], [[Leo Cullum]], [[Richard Decker]], [[Pia Guerra]], [[J. B. Handelsman]], [[Helen E. Hokinson]], [[Ed Koren]], [[Reginald Marsh (artist)|Reginald Marsh]], [[Mary Petty]], [[George Price (New Yorker cartoonist)|George Price]], [[Charles Saxon]], [[David Snell (journalist)|David Snell]], [[Otto Soglow]], [[Saul Steinberg]], [[William Steig]], [[James Stevenson (illustrator)|James Stevenson]], Richard Taylor, [[James Thurber]], [[Pete Holmes]], Barney Tobey, and [[Gahan Wilson]].

Many early ''New Yorker'' cartoonists did not caption their own cartoons. In his book ''The Years with Ross'', Thurber describes the newspaper's weekly art meeting, where cartoons submitted over the previous week would be brought up from the mail room to be gone over by Ross, the editorial department, and a number of staff writers. Cartoons often would be rejected or sent back to artists with requested amendments, while others would be accepted and captions written for them. Some artists hired their own writers; Helen Hokinson hired James Reid Parker in 1931. ([[Brendan Gill]] relates in his book ''Here at The New Yorker'' that at one point in the early 1940s, the quality of the artwork submitted to the magazine seemed to improve. It later was found out that the office boy (a teen-aged [[Truman Capote]]) had been acting as a volunteer art editor, dropping pieces he didn't like down the far edge of his desk.)<ref>Gill, Brendan. ''Here at The New Yorker''. New York: Berkley Medallion Press, 1976. p. 341.</ref>

Several of the magazine's cartoons have climbed to a higher plateau of fame. One 1928 cartoon drawn by [[Carl Rose (cartoonist)|Carl Rose]] and captioned by [[E.&nbsp;B. White]] shows a mother telling her daughter, "It's broccoli, dear." The daughter responds, "I say it's spinach and I say the hell with it." The phrase "[[I say it's spinach]]" entered the vernacular (and three years later, the Broadway musical ''Face the Music'' included [[Irving Berlin]]'s musical number entitled "[[I Say It's Spinach (And the Hell with It)]]").<ref>Gill (1976), p. 220.</ref> The [[catchphrase]] "[[wikt:back to the drawing board|back to the drawing board]]" originated with the 1941 Peter Arno cartoon showing an engineer walking away from a crashed plane, saying, "Well, back to the old drawing board."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://michaelmaslin.com/index.php?page=finding-arno|title=Michael Maslin – Finding Arno|access-date=May 30, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080917221618/http://michaelmaslin.com/index.php?page=finding-arno|archive-date=September 17, 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/arno11.jpg|title=CBR.com – The World's Top Destination For Comic, Movie & TV news}}</ref>

The most reprinted is [[Peter Steiner (cartoonist)|Peter Steiner]]'s 1993 drawing of two dogs at a computer, with one saying, "[[On the Internet, nobody knows you're a dog]]". According to Mankoff, Steiner and the magazine have split more than $100,000 in fees paid for the licensing and reprinting of this single cartoon, with more than half going to Steiner.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/12/14/technology/14DOGG.html?pagewanted=1&ei=5070&en=f0518aafeccf36fd&ex=1183089600|title=Cartoon Captures Spirit of the Internet|first=Glenn|last=Fleishman|work=The New York Times|date=December 14, 2000|access-date=October 1, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090416205920/http://www.nytimes.com/2000/12/14/technology/14DOGG.html?pagewanted=1&ei=5070&en=f0518aafeccf36fd&ex=1183089600 |archive-date=April 16, 2009 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.unc.edu/depts/jomc/academics/dri/idog.html Peter Steiner's "On the Internet, nobody knows you're a dog."]</ref>

Over seven decades, many hardcover compilations of cartoons from ''The New Yorker'' have been published, and in 2004, Mankoff edited ''The Complete Cartoons of The New Yorker'', a 656-page collection with 2004 of the magazine's best cartoons published during 80 years, plus a double CD set with all 68,647 cartoons ever published in the magazine. This features a search function allowing readers to search for cartoons by a cartoonist's name or by year of publication. The newer group of cartoonists in recent years includes [[Pat Byrnes]], Frank Cotham, Michael Crawford, Joe Dator, Drew Dernavich, [[J. C. Duffy]], Carolita Johnson, Zachary Kanin, Farley Katz, [[Robert Leighton (cartoonist)|Robert Leighton]], Glen Le Lievre, [[Michael Maslin]], Ariel Molvig, Paul Noth, Barbara Smaller, David Sipress, Mick Stevens, [[Julia Suits]], Christopher Weyant, [[P. C. Vey]], and Jack Ziegler. The notion that some ''New Yorker'' cartoons have punchlines so ''[[Non sequitur (absurdism)|non sequitur]]'' that they are impossible to understand became a subplot in the ''[[Seinfeld]]'' episode "[[The Cartoon]]", as well as a playful jab in an episode of ''[[The Simpsons]]'', "[[The Sweetest Apu]]".

In April 2005, the magazine began using the last page of each issue for "The New Yorker Cartoon [[Caption Contest]]". Captionless cartoons by ''The New Yorker''{{'}}s regular cartoonists are printed each week. Captions are submitted by readers, and three are chosen as finalists. Readers then vote on the winner. Anyone age thirteen or older can enter or vote.<ref>{{cite web |title=Caption Contest Rules |url=https://www.newyorker.com/about/caption-contest-rules |website=The New Yorker |access-date=July 12, 2018}}</ref> Each contest winner receives a print of the cartoon (with the winning caption), signed by the artist who drew the cartoon.

== Crosswords and puzzles ==
The New Yorker launched a crossword puzzle series in April 2018 with a weekday crossword published every Monday. Subsequently, it launched a second, weekend crossword that appears on Fridays and relaunched cryptic puzzles that were run in the magazine in the late 1990s. The puzzles are written by a rotating stable of seven constructors. The crosswords integrate cartoons into the puzzle playing experience. The Christmas 2019 issue featured a crossword puzzle by Patrick Berry that had cartoons as clues, and the answers were captions for the cartoons. In December 2019, Liz Maynes-Aminzade was named the first puzzles and games editor of The New Yorker.

== Films ==
''The New Yorker'' has been the source of a number of movies. Both fiction and non-fiction pieces have been adapted for the big screen, including ''[[Flash of Genius (film)|Flash of Genius]]'' (2008), based on a true account of the invention of the intermittent windshield wiper by [[John Seabrook]]; ''[[Away From Her]]'', adapted from Alice Munro's short story "The Bear Came over the Mountain", which debuted at the 2007 [[Sundance Film Festival]]; ''[[The Namesake (film)|The Namesake]]'' (2007), similarly based on [[Jhumpa Lahiri]]'s novel, which originated as a short story in the magazine; ''[[The Bridge (2006 documentary film)|The Bridge]]'' (2006), based on [[Tad Friend]]'s 2003 non-fiction piece "Jumpers"; ''[[Brokeback Mountain]]'' (2005), an adaptation of the short story by [[E. Annie Proulx|Annie Proulx]] that first appeared in the October 13, 1997, issue of ''The New Yorker''; [[Jonathan Safran Foer]]'s 2001 debut in ''The New Yorker'', which later came to theaters in Liev Schreiber's debut as both screenwriter and director, ''[[Everything Is Illuminated (film)|Everything Is Illuminated]]'' (2005); [[Michael Cunningham]]'s'' [[The Hours (film)|The Hours]]'', which appeared in the pages of ''The New Yorker'' before becoming the film that garnered the 2002 Best Actress Academy Award for [[Nicole Kidman]]; ''[[Adaptation (film)|Adaptation]]'' (2002), which [[Charlie Kaufman]] based on [[Susan Orlean]]'s ''The Orchid Thief'', written for ''The New Yorker''; Frank McCourt's ''[[Angela's Ashes]]'', which also appeared, in part, in ''The New Yorker'' in 1996 before its film adaptation was released in 1999; ''[[The Addams Family (1991 film)|The Addams Family]]'' (1991) and its sequel, ''[[Addams Family Values]]'' (1993), both inspired by the work of famed ''New Yorker'' cartoonist [[Charles Addams]]; [[Brian De Palma]]'s ''[[Casualties of War]]'' (1989), which began as a ''New Yorker'' article by Daniel Lang; ''[[Boys Don't Cry (film)|Boys Don't Cry]]'' (1999), starring Hilary Swank, began as an article in the magazine, and ''[[Iris (2001 film)|Iris]]'' (2001), about the life of Iris Murdoch and John Bayley, the article written by John Bayley for ''The New Yorker'', before he completed his full memoir, the film starring Judi Dench and Jim Broadbent; ''[[The Swimmer (1968 film)|The Swimmer]]'' (1968), starring [[Burt Lancaster]], based on a John Cheever short story from ''The New Yorker''; ''[[In Cold Blood]]'' (1967), the widely nominated adaptation of the 1965 non-fiction serial written for ''The New Yorker'' by [[Truman Capote]]; ''[[Pal Joey (film)|Pal Joey]]'' (1957), based on a series of stories by John O'Hara; ''[[Mister 880]]'' (1950), starring [[Edmund Gwenn]], based on a story by longtime editor [[St. Clair McKelway]]; ''[[The Secret Life of Walter Mitty (1947 film)|The Secret Life of Walter Mitty]]'' (1947), which began as a story by longtime ''New Yorker'' contributor James Thurber; and ''[[Junior Miss]]'' (1941) and ''[[Meet Me in St. Louis (film)|Meet Me in St. Louis]]'' (1944), both adapted from [[Sally Benson]]'s short stories.

The history of ''The New Yorker'' has also been portrayed in film: In ''[[Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle]]'', a film about the celebrated [[Algonquin Round Table]] starring [[Jennifer Jason Leigh]] as [[Dorothy Parker]], [[Sam Robards]] portrays founding editor Harold Ross trying to drum up support for his fledgling publication. The magazine's former editor, [[William Shawn]], is portrayed in ''[[Capote (film)|Capote]]'' (2005), ''[[Infamous (2006 film)|Infamous]]'' (2006) and ''[[Hannah Arendt (film)|Hannah Arendt]]'' (2012).

The 2015 documentary ''Very Semi-Serious'', produced by Redora Films, presents a behind-the-scenes look at the cartoons of ''The New Yorker''.

== Readership ==
Despite its title, ''The New Yorker'' is read nationwide, with 53 percent of its circulation in the top 10 U.S. metropolitan areas. According to Mediamark Research Inc., the average age of ''The New Yorker'' reader in 2009 was 47 (compared to 43 in 1980 and 46 in 1990). The average household income of ''The New Yorker'' readers in 2009 was $109,877 (the average income in 1980 was $62,788 and the average income in 1990 was $70,233).<ref>[https://www.census.gov/Press-Release/www/releases/archives/income_wealth/012528.html Census.gov].

[[File:Alfred D’Orsay.png|thumb|upright=0.7|right|Image of [[Alfred d'Orsay]] (1801–1852), published by [[James Baillie Fraser|James Fraser]] (1783–1856).]]
The magazine's first cover illustration, a [[dandy]] peering at a butterfly through a [[monocle]], was drawn by [[Rea Irvin]], the magazine's first art editor, based on an 1834 caricature of the then [[Alfred Guillaume Gabriel, Count d'Orsay|Count d'Orsay]] which appeared as an illustration in the 11th edition of the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hoc.uspoc.us/2010/eustace-tilley/|title=Eustace Tilley|date=March 29, 2010}}</ref> The gentleman on the original cover, now referred to as "Eustace Tilley", is a character created by [[Corey Ford]] (1902–1969) for ''The New Yorker''. The hero of a series entitled "The Making of a Magazine", which began on the inside front cover of the August 8 issue that first summer, Tilley was a younger man than the figure on the original cover. His [[top hat]] was of a newer style, without the curved brim. He wore a [[morning coat]] and striped [[formal trousers]]. Ford borrowed Eustace Tilley's last name from an aunt—he had always found it vaguely humorous. "Eustace" was selected by Ford for [[Phonaesthetics|euphony]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kunkel|first1=Thomas|title=Genius in Disguise|url=https://archive.org/details/geniusindisguise00kunk|url-access=registration|date=June 1996|publisher=Carroll & Graf Publishers|page=512}}</ref>

The character has become a kind of [[mascot]] for ''The New Yorker'', frequently appearing in its pages and on promotional materials. Traditionally, Rea Irvin's original Tilley cover illustration is used every year on the issue closest to the anniversary date of February 21, though on several occasions a newly drawn variation has been substituted.<ref>{{cite web|last=Mouly|first=Françoise|url=https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/cover-story-nine-ninety|title=Cover Story: Nine for Ninety|work=The New Yorker|date=February 16, 2015|access-date=July 31, 2015}}</ref>

== Covers ==
{{Overly detailed|section|date=December 2019}}
The magazine is well known for its illustrated and often topical covers.

=== "View of the World" cover ===
{{main|View of the World from 9th Avenue}}
Saul Steinberg created 85 covers and 642 internal drawings and illustrations for the magazine. His most famous work is probably its March 29, 1976, cover,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.condenaststore.com/-sp/The-New-Yorker-Cover-View-of-the-World-from-9th-Avenue-March-29-1976-Prints_i8553097_.htm|title=The New Yorker Cover, View of the World from 9th Avenue – March 29, 1976 Poster Print by Saul Steinberg at the Condé Nast Collection}}</ref> an illustration most often referred to as "View of the World from [[Ninth Avenue (Manhattan)|9th Avenue]]", sometimes referred to as "A [[parochialism|Parochial]] New Yorker's View of the World" or "A New Yorker's View of the World", which depicts a map of the world as seen by [[narcissism|self-absorbed]] New Yorkers.

The illustration is split in two, with the bottom half of the image showing [[Manhattan]]'s 9th Avenue, [[Tenth Avenue (Manhattan)|10th Avenue]], and the [[Hudson River]] (appropriately labeled), and the top half depicting the rest of the world. The rest of the United States is the size of the three New York City blocks and is drawn as a square, with a thin brown strip along the Hudson representing [[New Jersey|"Jersey"]], the names of five cities ([[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]]; [[Washington, D.C.]]; [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]]; [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]]; and [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]]) and three states ([[Texas]], [[Utah]], and [[Nebraska]]) scattered among a few rocks for the United States beyond New Jersey. The Pacific Ocean, perhaps half again as wide as the Hudson, separates the United States from three flattened land masses labeled China, Japan and Russia.

The illustration—humorously depicting New Yorkers' self-image of their place in the world, or perhaps outsiders' view of New Yorkers' self-image—inspired many similar works, including the poster for the [[1984 in film|1984 film]] ''[[Moscow on the Hudson]]''; that movie poster led to a lawsuit, ''[[Steinberg v. Columbia Pictures Industries, Inc.]]'', 663 F. Supp. 706 ([[United States District Court for the Southern District of New York|S.D.N.Y.]] 1987), which held that [[Columbia Pictures]] violated the [[copyright]] that Steinberg held on his work.

The cover was later satirized by Barry Blitt for the cover of ''The New Yorker'' on October 6, 2008. The cover featured [[Sarah Palin]] looking out of her window seeing only Alaska, with Russia in the far background.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.condenaststore.com/-sp/The-New-Yorker-Cover-October-6-2008-Prints_i8482999_.htm|title=New Yorker Cover – 10/6/2008 at The New Yorker Store|publisher=Newyorkerstore.com|date=October 6, 2008|access-date=October 15, 2010}}</ref>

The March 21, 2009, cover of ''[[The Economist]]'', "How China sees the World", is also an homage to the original image, depicting the viewpoint from Beijing's [[Chang'an Avenue]] instead of Manhattan.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/21521345|title=Issue Cover for March 21, 2009|publisher=Economist.com|date=March 21, 2009 |access-date=August 26, 2012}}</ref>

=== 9/11 ===
Hired by Tina Brown in 1992, [[Art Spiegelman]] worked for ''The New Yorker'' for ten years but resigned a few months after the [[September&nbsp;11 terrorist attacks]]. The cover created by Françoise Mouly and Spiegelman for the September 24, 2001, issue of ''The New Yorker'' received wide acclaim and was voted as being among the top ten magazine covers of the past 40 years by the American Society of Magazine Editors, which commented:
{{quote|''New Yorker'' Covers Editor Françoise Mouly repositioned Art Spiegelman's silhouettes, inspired by [[Ad Reinhardt]]'s black-on-black paintings, so that the North Tower's antenna breaks the "W" of the magazine's logo. Spiegelman wanted to see the emptiness, and find the awful/awe-filled image of all that disappeared on 9/11. The silhouetted Twin Towers were printed in a fifth, black ink, on a field of black made up of the standard four color printing inks. An overprinted clear varnish helps create the ghost images that linger, insisting on their presence through the blackness.}}

At first glance, the cover appears to be totally black, but upon close examination it reveals the silhouettes of the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]] towers in a slightly darker shade of black. In some situations, the ghost images become visible only when the magazine is tilted toward a light source.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.magazine.org/asme/magazine-cover-contests/asmes-top-40-magazine-covers-last-40-years|title=ASME's Top 40 Magazine Covers of the Last 40 Years – ASME|access-date=December 23, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181104050040/http://www.magazine.org/asme/magazine-cover-contests/asmes-top-40-magazine-covers-last-40-years|archive-date=November 4, 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref> In September 2004, Spiegelman reprised the image on the cover of his book ''[[In the Shadow of No Towers]]'', in which he relates his experience of the Twin Towers attack and the psychological after-effects.

=== "New Yorkistan" ===
{{Main|New Yorkistan}}
In the December 2001 issue, the magazine printed a cover by [[Maira Kalman]] and [[Rick Meyerowitz]] showing a map of New York in which various neighborhoods were labeled with humorous names reminiscent of Middle Eastern and Central Asian place names and referencing the neighborhood's real name or characteristics (e.g., "Fuhgeddabouditstan", "Botoxia"). The cover had some cultural resonance in the wake of September 11, and became a popular print and poster.<ref>{{cite news|title=The New Yorker uncovers an unexpected profit center – Ancillary Profits – by licensing cover illustrations|work=Folio: The Magazine for Magazine Management|date=February 2002|publisher=Highbeam.com|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-83296829.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160504224203/https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-83296829.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=2016-05-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.opinionjournal.com/la/?id=110004685|title=A Print by Any Other Name...|author=Daniel Grand|date=February 12, 2004|work=OpinionJournal}}</ref>

=== Controversial covers ===
==== Crown Heights in 1993 ====

==== 2008 Obama cover satire and controversy ====
[[File:New Yorker magazine Politics of Fear.png|thumb|right|Barry Blitt's cover from the July 21, 2008, issue of ''The New Yorker'']]
"The Politics of Fear", a cartoon by [[Barry Blitt]] featured on the cover of the July 21, 2008, issue, depicts then presumptive [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] [[2008 United States presidential election|presidential]] nominee [[Barack Obama]] in the [[turban]] and [[shalwar kameez]] typical of many [[Muslim]]s, [[fist bump]]ing with his wife, [[Michelle Obama|Michelle]], portrayed with an [[Afro]] and wearing [[Military camouflage|camouflage]] trousers with an [[assault rifle]] slung over her back. They are standing in the [[Oval Office]], with a portrait of [[Osama Bin Laden]] hanging on the wall and an [[American flag]] [[Flag desecration|burning]] in the fireplace in the background.<ref>{{cite news|author=The Associated Press |title=New Yorker cover stirs controversy |publisher=Canoe.ca |url=http://cnews.canoe.ca/CNEWS/MediaNews/2008/07/14/6151776-ap.html |date=July 14, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20080731163939/http://cnews.canoe.ca/CNEWS/MediaNews/2008/07/14/6151776-ap.html |archive-date=July 31, 2008 }}</ref>

Many ''New Yorker'' readers saw the image as a lampoon of "The Politics of Fear", as was its title. Some of Obama's supporters as well as his presumptive Republican opponent, [[John McCain|Sen. John McCain]], accused the magazine of publishing an incendiary cartoon whose irony could be lost on some readers. However, editor David Remnick felt the image's obvious excesses rebuffed the concern that it could be misunderstood, even by those unfamiliar with the magazine.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thespec.com/opinion/article/143986--was-it-satire|title=Was it satire?|newspaper=[[The Hamilton Spectator]]|date=July 19, 2008|access-date=February 24, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717031905/http://www.thespec.com/opinion/article/143986--was-it-satire|archive-date=July 17, 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marieclaire.co.uk/news/world/266893/barack-obama-new-yorker-cover-branded-tasteless.html|title=Barack Obama New Yorker Cover Branded Tasteless|work=[[Marie Claire]]|date=July 15, 2008|access-date=February 24, 2011}}</ref> "The intent of the cover", he said, "is to satirize the vicious and racist attacks and rumors and misconceptions about the Obamas that have been floating around in the [[blogosphere]] and are reflected in public opinion polls. What we set out to do was to throw all these images together, which are all over the top and to shine a kind of harsh light on them, to satirize them."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalpunch/2008/07/new-yorker-edit.html|title=New Yorker Editor David Remnick Talks to ABC News About Cover Controversy|work=[[ABC News]]|author=Jake Tapper|date=July 14, 2008|access-date=February 24, 2011}}</ref>

In an interview on ''[[Larry King Live]]'' shortly after the magazine issue began circulating, Obama said, "Well, I know it was ''The New Yorker''{{'}}s attempt at satire... I don't think they were entirely successful with it". Obama also pointed to his own efforts to debunk the allegations portrayed in ''The New Yorker'' cover through a web site his campaign set up, stating that the allegations were "actually an insult against Muslim-Americans".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2008/07/16/democrats_bus_heads_south_to_sign_up_new_voters/|title=Democrats' bus heads South to sign up new voters|work=[[The Boston Globe]]|date=July 16, 2008|access-date=February 24, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalpunch/2008/07/new-ironic-new.html|title=Obama Camp Hammers New 'Ironic' New Yorker Cover Depicting Conspiracists' Nightmare of Real Obamas|publisher=ABC News|author=Jake Tapper|date=July 13, 2008|work=Political Punch|access-date=February 24, 2011}}</ref>

Later that week, ''[[The Daily Show]]''{{'}}s [[Jon Stewart]] continued ''The New Yorker'' cover's argument about Obama stereotypes with a piece showcasing a montage of clips containing such stereotypes culled from various legitimate news sources.<ref>[http://www.cc.com/video-clips/twlbqc/the-daily-show-with-jon-stewart-obama-cartoon "Obama Cartoon"], ''The Daily Show'', July 15, 2008.</ref> The ''New Yorker'' Obama cover was later parodied by Stewart and [[Stephen Colbert]] on the October 3, 2008, cover of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' magazine, with Stewart as Obama and Colbert as Michelle, photographed for the magazine in New York City on September 18.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ew.com/ew/inside/issue/0,,ewTax:1014,00.html |title=''Entertainment Weekly'' October 3, 2008, Issue #1014 cover |work=Entertainment Weekly |author=Josh Wolk |date=September 30, 2008 |access-date=February 24, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090427075552/http://www.ew.com/ew/inside/issue/0%2C%2CewTax%3A1014%2C00.html |archive-date=April 27, 2009 }}</ref>

''New Yorker'' covers are not always related to the contents of the magazine or are only tangentially so. In this case, the article in the July 21, 2008, issue about Obama did not discuss the attacks and rumors but rather Obama's political career. The magazine later endorsed Obama for president.

This parody was most likely inspired by [[Fox News]] host [[E. D. Hill]]'s paraphrasing of an anonymous internet comment in asking whether a gesture made by Obama and his wife Michelle was a "terrorist fist jab".<ref>{{cite web|first=Christopher |last=Beam |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2195347/ |title=The 'Terrorist Fist Jab' and Me |work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] |date=July 14, 2008 |access-date=January 23, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091227041719/http://www.slate.com/id/2195347 |archive-date=December 27, 2009 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Fox News anchor calls the Obamas' fist pound 'a terrorist fist jab' |url=http://thinkprogress.org/2008/06/09/fox-news-anchor-calls-the-obamas-fist-pound-a-terrorist-fist-jab/ |website=[[Think Progress]] |access-date=June 10, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080610230043/http://thinkprogress.org/2008/06/09/fox-news-anchor-calls-the-obamas-fist-pound-a-terrorist-fist-jab/ |archive-date=June 10, 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Later, Hill's contract was not renewed.<ref>[https://huffingtonpost.com/2008/06/10/fox-news-changes-terroris_n_106306.html "Fox News Changes: 'Terrorist Fist Jab' Anchor E.D.

==== 2013 Bert and Ernie cover ====
''The New Yorker'' chose an image of [[Bert and Ernie]] by artist Jack Hunter, entitled "Moment of Joy", as the cover of their July 8, 2013, publication, which covers the Supreme Court decisions on the [[Defense of Marriage Act]] and [[California Proposition 8]].<ref name="New Yorker">{{cite journal

Online magazine ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' criticized the cover, which shows Ernie leaning on Bert's shoulder as they watch a television with the Supreme Court justices on the screen, saying "it's a terrible way to commemorate a major civil-rights victory for gay and lesbian couples." ''[[The Huffington Post]]'', meanwhile, said it was "one of [the magazine's] most awesome covers of all time".<ref name="ABC News">{{cite web|url = https://abcnews.go.com/blogs/headlines/2013/06/bert-and-ernie-cuddle-over-supreme-court-ruling/
