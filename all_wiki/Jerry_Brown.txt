'''Edmund Gerald Brown Jr.''' (born April 7, 1938) is an American politician who served as the 34th and 39th [[governor of California]] from 1975 to 1983 and 2011 to 2019. A member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], he was elected [[Secretary of State of California]] in the early 1970s; Brown later served as Mayor of [[Oakland, California|Oakland]] from 1999 to 2007 and [[Attorney General of California]] from 2007 to 2011. He was both the [[List of Governors of California by age|oldest and sixth-youngest]] governor of California as a consequence of the 28-year gap between his second and third terms. Upon completing his fourth term in office, Brown became the third longest-serving governor in U.S. history, serving 16 years and 7 days in office.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://editions.lib.umn.edu/smartpolitics/2017/05/29/the-top-50-longest-serving-governors-in-us-history-updated/|title=The Top 50 Longest Serving Governors in US History (Updated)|first=Eric|last=Ostermeier|date=May 29, 2017}}</ref>

Born in [[San Francisco]], he was the son of [[Bernice Layne Brown]] and [[Pat Brown]], who was the 32nd Governor of California (1959–1967). After graduating from the [[University of California, Berkeley]] and [[Yale University]], he practiced law and began his political career as a member of the [[Los Angeles Community College District]] Board of Trustees (1969–1971). He was elected to serve as the 23rd Secretary of State of California from 1971 to 1975. At 36, Brown was elected to his first term as governor in [[1974 California gubernatorial election|1974]], making him the youngest California Governor in 111 years. In [[1978 California gubernatorial election|1978]], he won his second term. During his governorship, Brown ran unsuccessfully as a candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination in [[1976 Democratic Party presidential primaries|1976]] and [[1980 Democratic Party presidential primaries|1980]]. He declined to pursue a third term as governor in [[1982 California gubernatorial election|1982]], instead making an unsuccessful run for the [[United States Senate]] that [[1982 United States Senate election in California|same year]].

After traveling abroad, he returned to California and served as the sixth Chairman of the [[California Democratic Party]] (1989–1991), attempting to run for U.S. President once more in [[1992 Democratic Party presidential primaries|1992]]. He then moved to Oakland, where he hosted a [[talk radio]] show; Brown soon returned to public life, serving as [[List of mayors of Oakland, California|Mayor of Oakland]] (1999–2007) and [[Attorney General of California]] (2007–2011). He ran for his third and fourth terms as governor in [[2010 California gubernatorial election|2010]] and [[2014 California gubernatorial election|2014]], his eligibility to do so having stemmed from California's constitutional [[grandfather clause]]. On October 7, 2013, he became the longest-serving governor in the [[history of California]], surpassing [[Earl Warren]].

==Early life, education and private career==

In 1974, Brown ran in a highly contested Democratic primary for Governor of California against [[Speaker of the California Assembly]] [[Bob Moretti]], San Francisco Mayor [[Joseph L. Alioto]], Representative [[Jerome R. Waldie]], and others. Brown won the primary with the name recognition of his father, Pat Brown, whom many people admired for his progressive administration.<ref>{{cite news|last=Kotkin |first=Joel |url=https://blogs.forbes.com/joelkotkin/2011/01/03/californias-third-brown-era/ |title=California's Third Brown Era – Joel Kotkin – New Geographer|work=Forbes |date=December 30, 2010 |access-date=January 21, 2011}}</ref> In the General Election on November 5, 1974, Brown was elected Governor of California over California State Controller [[Houston I. Flournoy]]; Republicans ascribed the loss to anti-Republican feelings from [[Watergate]], the election being held only ninety days after President [[Richard Nixon]] resigned from office. Brown succeeded Republican Governor [[Ronald Reagan]], who retired after two terms.

As governor, Brown held a strong interest in [[environmental issues]]. He appointed [[J.

In 1975, Brown opposed Vietnamese immigration to California, saying that the state had enough poor people. He added, “There is something a little strange about saying ‘Let’s bring in 500,000 more people’ when we can’t take care of the 1 million (Californians) out of work.”<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/when-jerry-brown-tried-to-keep-immigrants-out-of-california-1520634989|title=When Jerry Brown Tried to Keep Immigrants Out of California|first=Joseph|last=D’Hippolito|website=WSJ}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bostonherald.com/2019/01/17/williams-why-dems-changed-course-on-illegal-immigration/|title=Williams: Why Dems changed course on illegal immigration|date=January 17, 2019}}</ref>

Brown strongly opposed the [[death penalty]] and vetoed it as governor, which the legislature overrode in 1977.<ref>{{Harvnb|Schell|1978|pp=232, 248–249}}</ref> He also appointed judges who opposed capital punishment.

Despite this success, he was unable to stall Carter's momentum, and his rival was nominated on the first ballot at the [[1976 Democratic National Convention]]. Brown finished third with roughly 300 delegate votes, narrowly behind Congressman [[Morris Udall]] and Carter.

Brown won re-election in 1978 against Republican state Attorney General [[Evelle J. Younger]].

He also signed AB 607, which banned homosexuals from receiving civil marriage licenses, in 1977.

Brown championed the [[Peripheral Canal]] project to transport water from near Sacramento around the [[Sacramento–San Joaquin River Delta|Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta]] into the Central Valley Project, and export it to southern California. It was submitted to the voters for approval as a ballot proposition in 1982, but was turned down.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gwynn|first=Douglas|date=February 1983|title=The California Peripheral Canal: who backed it, who fought it|url=https://ucanr.edu/repositoryfiles/ca3701p22-70808.pdf|journal=California Agriculture|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160604145356/https://ucanr.edu/repositoryfiles/ca3701p22-70808.pdf|archive-date=2016-06-04|url-status=dead}}</ref>

In 1981, Brown, who had established a reputation as a strong environmentalist, was confronted with a serious [[medfly]] infestation in the San Francisco Bay Area. He was advised by the state's agricultural industry, and the US Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection service ([[APHIS]]), to authorize airborne spraying of the region. Initially, in accordance with his environmental protection stance, he chose to authorize ground-level spraying only. Unfortunately, the infestation spread as the medfly reproductive cycle out-paced the spraying. After more than a month, millions of dollars of crops had been destroyed and billions of dollars more were threatened. Governor Brown then authorized a massive response to the infestation. Fleets of helicopters sprayed [[malathion]] at night, and the [[California National Guard]] set up highway checkpoints and collected many tons of local fruit; in the final stage of the campaign, entomologists released millions of [[sterile insect technique|sterile male medflies]] in an attempt to disrupt the insects' reproductive cycle.

Ultimately, the infestation was eradicated, but both the Governor's delay and the scale of the action have remained controversial ever since. Some people claimed that malathion was toxic to humans, as well as insects. In response to such concerns, Brown's chief of staff, [[B. T. Collins]], staged a news conference during which he publicly drank a glass of malathion. Many people complained that, while the malathion may not have been very toxic to humans, the aerosol spray containing it was corrosive to car paint.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/17/us/the-battle-over-the-medfly.html|title=The Battle Over the Medfly|last=Haberman|first=Clyde|date=2014-03-16|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-09-07}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/12/10/us/california-resumes-air-war-against-invading-fruit-fly-stirring-debate.html|title=California Resumes Air War Against Invading Fruit Fly, Stirring Debate|last=Times|first=Alexandra Smith, Special To The New York|date=1989-12-10|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-09-07}}</ref>

Brown proposed the establishment of a state space academy and the purchasing of a [[satellite]] that would be launched into orbit to provide emergency communications for the state—a proposal similar to one that was indeed eventually adopted. In 1979, an out-of-state columnist, [[Mike Royko]], at the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'', picked up on the nickname from Brown's [[girlfriend]] at the time, [[Linda Ronstadt]], who was quoted in a 1978 ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine interview humorously calling him "Moonbeam".<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/zach-friend/california-governors-race_b_611344.html |first=Zach |last=Friend |title=California Governor's Race: Why Moonbeam Will Win |work=[[The Huffington Post]] |date=June 14, 2010 |access-date=November 18, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Our Latest Export: Gov.

Some notable figures were given priority, correspondence access to him in either advisory or personal roles. These included [[United Farm Workers of America]] founder [[Cesar Chavez]], [[Hewlett-Packard]] co-founder [[David Packard]], labor leader [[Jack Henning]], and [[Charles Manatt]], then-Chairman of the California State Democratic Party. Mail was routed as [[VIP]] to be delivered directly to the governor.

In 1978, San Francisco [[punk band]] the [[Dead Kennedys]]' first single, "[[California Über Alles]]", from the album [[Fresh Fruit for Rotting Vegetables]], was released; it was performed from the perspective of then-governor Brown painting a picture of a [[hippie]]-[[fascist]] state, satirizing what they considered his mandating of liberal ideas in a fascist manner, commenting on what lyricist [[Jello Biafra]] saw as the corrosive nature of power. The imaginary Brown had become President Brown presiding over secret police and gas chambers. Biafra later said in an interview with ''[[Nardwuar]]'' that he now feels differently about Brown; as it turned out, Brown was not as bad as Biafra thought he would be, and subsequent songs have been written about other politicians deemed worse.<ref>{{cite news |first=John |last=Ruskin |url=http://www.nardwuar.com/vs/jello_biafra/jello-2002_page-2.html |title=Nardwuar the Human Serviette vs Jello Biafra |publisher=Nardwuar |year=2002 |access-date=April 21, 2009}}</ref>

Brown chose not to run for a third term in 1982, and instead ran for the [[United States Senate]], but lost to [[Mayor of San Diego|San Diego Mayor]] [[Pete Wilson]]. He was succeeded as governor by [[George Deukmejian]], then state attorney general, on January 3, 1983.

===1980 presidential election===
{{Main|1980 Democratic Party presidential primaries}}
[[File:Jerry Brown in 1978 crop.jpg|thumb|left|Brown in 1978]]
In 1980, Brown challenged Carter for renomination. His candidacy had been anticipated by the press ever since he won re-election as governor in 1978 over the Republican [[Evelle Younger]] by 1.3 million votes, the largest margin in California history. But Brown had trouble gaining traction in both fundraising and polling for the presidential nomination. This was widely believed to be because of the more prominent candidate Senator [[Ted Kennedy]] of [[Massachusetts]]. Brown's 1980 platform, which he declared to be the natural result of combining [[Buckminster Fuller]]'s visions of the future and [[E. F. Schumacher]]'s theory of "[[Buddhist economics]]", was much expanded from 1976. His "era of limits" slogan was replaced by a promise to, in his words, "Protect the Earth, serve the people, and explore the universe".

Three main planks of his platform were a call for a [[constitutional convention (political meeting)|constitutional convention]] to ratify the [[Balanced Budget Amendment]]; a promise to increase funds for the [[space program]] as a "first step in bringing us toward a solar-powered space [[space-based solar power|satellite to provide solar energy]] for this planet";<ref>{{cite news|last=Rood|first=W.B.|date=September 26, 1979|title=Brown proposes $2 billion revival of space program|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|page=B9|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/651211032.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:AI|quote=He called it the 'first step in bringing us toward a solar-powered space satellite to provide solar energy for this planet.'}}</ref> and, in the wake of the 1979 [[Three Mile Island accident]], opposition to [[nuclear power]]. On the subject of the [[1979 energy crisis]], Brown decried the "[[deal with the Devil|Faustian bargain]]" that he claimed Carter had entered into with the [[oil industry]], and declared that he would greatly increase federal funding of research into [[solar power]]. He endorsed the idea of mandatory non-military [[national service]] for the nation's youth and suggested that the [[United States Defense Department|Defense Department]] cut back on support troops while beefing up the number of combat troops.

Brown opposed Kennedy's call for [[universal health care|universal]] [[national health insurance]] and opposed Carter's call for an employer mandate to provide catastrophic private health insurance labeling it socialist.<ref name="Brown health plan">{{cite news|last=Kempster|first=Norman|date=November 11, 1979|title=Brown calls opponents' health insurance programs part of a 'medical arms race'|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|page=A4|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/647930002.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:AI|quote=As an alternative, the governor suggested a program of tax credits as a 'wellness incentive' for people who do not smoke or otherwise damage their own health.

As Brown's campaign began to attract more members of what some more conservative commentators described as "the fringe", including activists like [[Jane Fonda]], [[Tom Hayden]], and [[Jesse Jackson]], his polling numbers began to suffer. Brown received only 10 percent of the vote in the [[New Hampshire primary]], and he was soon forced to announce that his decision to remain in the race would depend on a good showing in the [[Wisconsin]] primary. Although he had polled well there throughout the primary season, an attempt to film a live speech in [[Madison, Wisconsin|Madison]], the state's capital, into a [[special effects]]-filled, 30-minute commercial (produced and directed by [[Francis Ford Coppola]]) was disastrous.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=LoQwAAAAIBAJ&pg=3829,2892425&dq=jerry-brown+francis-ford-coppola+commercial |title= Jerry Brown Francis Ford Coppola Comercial|format=Search Result|access-date=November 18, 2010}}</ref>

==Senate defeat and public life==
In 1982, Brown chose not to seek a third term as governor; instead, he ran for the [[United States Senate]] for the seat being vacated by Republican [[S.I. Hayakawa]]. He was defeated by Republican San Diego Mayor [[Pete Wilson]] by a margin of 52% to 45%. After his Senate defeat, Brown was left with few political options.<ref name=eugeneregister>{{cite news|title=Brown beaten in Senate bid|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=PccUAAAAIBAJ&pg=5798,434388&dq=jerry-brown+pete-wilson|access-date=October 6, 2010|newspaper=Eugene Register-Guard|date=November 2, 1982|agency=Associated Press}}</ref> Republican [[George Deukmejian]], a Brown critic, narrowly won the governorship in 1982, succeeding Brown, and was re-elected overwhelmingly in 1986.

Brown traveled to Japan to study [[Buddhism]], studying with Christian/Zen practitioner [[Hugo Enomiya-Lassalle]] under [[Yamada Koun|Yamada Koun-roshi]].<ref name=asoakland's/><ref name="salon1996"/> In an interview, he explained, "Since politics is based on illusions, zazen definitely provides new insights for a politician.

And you're there to serve them, and doing that you are attaining as great a state of being as you can."<ref name="salon1996"/>

Upon his return from abroad in 1988, Brown announced that he would stand as a candidate to become [[chairman]] of the [[California Democratic Party]], and won against investment banker [[Steve Westly]].<ref>{{cite news|title=JERRY BROWN WINS STATE PARTY POST|url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FA071EF8395D0C708DDDAB0894D1484D81 |access-date=October 6, 2010|newspaper=The New York Times|date=February 13, 1989}}</ref> Although Brown greatly expanded the party's donor base and enlarged its coffers, with a focus on [[grassroots]] organizing and [[get out the vote]] drives, he was criticized for not spending enough money on TV ads, which was felt to have contributed to Democratic losses in several close races in 1990, such as [[Dianne Feinstein]]'s attempt to become the [[1990 California gubernatorial election|first female governor of California]]. In early 1991, Brown abruptly resigned his post and announced that he would run for the Senate seat held by the retiring [[Alan Cranston]]. Although Brown consistently led in the polls for both the nomination and the general election, he abandoned the campaign, deciding instead to run for the presidency for the third time.

==1992 presidential election==
{{Main|1992 Democratic Party presidential primaries}}
When Brown announced his intention to run for president against President [[George H. W. Bush]], many in the media and his own party dismissed his campaign as having little chance of gaining significant support. Ignoring them, Brown embarked on a [[grassroots democracy|grassroots]] campaign to, in his own words, "take back America from the confederacy of [[political corruption|corruption]], [[career]]ism, and campaign [[consultant|consulting]] in Washington".<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Dr2FAAAAMAAJ |title=The CQ guide to current American government, Volume 49 |date=October 13, 2008 |access-date=November 18, 2010}}</ref> In his [[Stump speech (politics)|stump speech]], first used while officially announcing his candidacy on the steps of [[Independence Hall (United States)|Independence Hall]] in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], Brown told listeners that he would be accepting [[campaign finance|campaign contributions]] from individuals only and that he would not accept over $100.<ref name="California Watch"/> Continuing with his populist [[reform movement|reform]] theme, he assailed what he dubbed "the [[bipartisanship|bipartisan]] Incumbent Party in Washington" and called for [[term limit]]s for members of [[Congress of the United States|Congress]]. Citing various recent scandals on [[Capitol Hill]], particularly the recent [[House banking scandal]] and the large congressional pay-raises from 1990, he promised to put an end to Congress being a "[[convenience store|Stop-and-Shop]] for the moneyed [[special interest]]s".

As Brown campaigned in various primary states, he would eventually expand his platform beyond a policy of strict [[campaign finance reform]]. Although he focused on a variety of issues throughout the campaign, he highlighted his endorsement of [[living wage]] laws and opposition to [[free trade]] agreements such as [[North American Free Trade Agreement|NAFTA]]; he mostly concentrated on his tax policy, which had been created specifically for him by [[Arthur Laffer]], the famous supporter of [[supply-side economics]] who created the [[Laffer curve]]. This plan, which called for the replacement of the [[progressive tax|progressive income tax]] with a [[flat tax]] and a [[value added tax]], both at a fixed 13-percent rate, was decried by his opponents as regressive. Nevertheless, it was endorsed by ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[The New Republic]]'', and ''[[Forbes]]'', and its raising of taxes on [[corporation]]s and elimination of various loopholes which tended to favor the very wealthy proved to be popular with voters. This was, perhaps, not surprising, as various [[opinion poll]]s taken at the time found that as many as three-quarters of all Americans believed the current tax code to be unfairly biased toward the wealthy. He "seemed to be the most left-wing and right-wing man in the field ... [calling] for term limits, a flat tax, reforming social security, and the abolition of the [[United States Department of Education|Department of Education]]".<ref name=Walker>[[Jesse Walker|Walker, Jesse]] (November 1, 2009) [http://www.amconmag.com/article/2009/nov/01/00012/ Five Faces of Jerry Brown] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629141411/http://www.amconmag.com/article/2009/nov/01/00012/ |date=June 29, 2011 }}, ''[[The American Conservative]]''</ref> Brown scored surprising wins in Connecticut and Colorado and seemed poised to overtake Clinton.

Due to his limited budget, Brown began to use a mixture of [[alternative media]] and unusual fundraising techniques. Unable to pay for actual commercials, he frequently used [[cable television]] and [[talk radio]] interviews as a form of free media to get his message to voters. In order to raise funds, he purchased a [[toll-free telephone number]], which adorned all of his campaign stances.<ref name=HuffPoHillary /> During the campaign, Brown's repetition of this number combined with the moralistic language used, led some to describe him as a "political [[televangelism|televangelist]]" with an "anti-politics gospel".<ref>"Brown Enters Race as Leader Against 'Corrupt Politics'", Associated Press, October 22, 1991. Page A3.</ref>

Despite poor showings in the [[Iowa caucus]] (1.6%) and the [[New Hampshire Democratic primary, 1992|New Hampshire primary]] (8%), Brown soon managed to win narrow victories in [[Maine]], [[Colorado]], [[Nevada]], and [[Vermont]], but he continued to be considered a small threat for much of the campaign. It was not until shortly after [[Super Tuesday]], when the field had been narrowed to Brown, former Senator [[Paul Tsongas]] of Massachusetts, and front-runner then-Governor [[Bill Clinton]] of [[Arkansas]], that Brown began to emerge as a major contender in the eyes of the press. On March 17, Brown forced Tsongas from the race when he received a strong third-place showing in the [[Illinois]] primary and then defeated the senator for second place in the [[Michigan]] primary by a wide margin. Exactly one week later, he cemented his position as a major threat to Clinton when he eked out a narrow win in the bitterly fought [[Connecticut]] primary. As the press focused on the primaries in [[New York (state)|New York]] and [[Wisconsin]], which were both to be held on the same day, Brown, who had taken the lead in polls in both states, made a [[gaffe]]: He announced to an audience of various leaders of New York City's [[Jew]]ish community that, if nominated, he would consider the Reverend [[Jesse Jackson]] as a vice-presidential candidate.<ref name="Dowd">{{cite news|last=Dowd |first=Maureen |url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F10614F839540C708CDDAD0894DA494D81 |title=THE 1992 CAMPAIGN – Brown – Candidate Is Tripped Up Over Alliance With Jackson |location=New York State |work=The New York Times |date=April 3, 1992 |access-date=October 13, 2010}}</ref> Jackson, who had made a pair of [[anti-Semitism|anti-semitic]] comments about Jews in general, and New York City's Jews in particular, while running for president in 1984, was still mistrusted within the Jewish community. Jackson also had ties to [[Louis Farrakhan]], infamous for his own anti-semitic statements, and with [[Yasir Arafat]], the chairman of the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]].<ref name="Dowd"/> Brown's polling numbers suffered. On April 7, he lost narrowly to Bill Clinton in Wisconsin (37%–34%), and dramatically in New York (41%–26%).

Although Brown continued to campaign in a number of states, he won no further primaries. Despite being overwhelmingly outspent, Brown won upset victories in seven states and his "votes won to the money raised ratio" was by far the best of any candidate in the race.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/mike-lux/a-modern-populist-movemen_b_639408.html |title=Mike Lux: A Modern Populist Movement |work=The Huffington Post |date=July 8, 2010|access-date=October 13, 2010}}</ref> He still had a sizable number of delegates, and a big win in his home state of California would deprive Clinton of sufficient support to win the Democratic nomination, possibly bringing about a [[brokered convention]]. After nearly a month of intense campaigning and multiple debates between the two candidates, Clinton managed to defeat Brown in this final primary by a margin of 48% to 41%. Although Brown did not win the nomination, he was able to boast of one accomplishment: at the following month's [[1992 Democratic National Convention|Democratic National Convention]], he received the votes of 596 delegates on the first ballot, more than any other candidate but Clinton. He spoke at the convention, and to the national viewing audience, yet without endorsing Clinton, through the device of seconding his own nomination. There was animosity between the Brown and Clinton campaigns, and Brown was the first political figure to criticize Bill Clinton over what became known as the [[Whitewater controversy]].<ref name=HuffPoHillary>{{cite news |title=The OTHER Big Problem With Hillary's Notorious Remarks |first=William |last=Bradley |newspaper=The Huffington Post |date=May 25, 2008 |access-date=March 11, 2010 |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/william-bradley/the-other-big-problem-wit_b_103478.html}}</ref>

In 1995, with Brown's political career at a low point, in the motion picture [[Jade (film)|''Jade'']], the fictional Governor of California tells an assistant district attorney to drop a case, "unless you want as much of a future in this state as Jerry Brown". The assistant DA responds, "Who's Jerry Brown?"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/bw/articles/2013-04-25/jerry-brown-californias-grownup-governor|title=How Jerry Brown Scared California Straight|last=Stein|first=Joel|date=April 25, 2013|work=Bloomberg Business}}</ref>

In Oakland, Brown became involved as an activist in local political matters, including bay-front development and campaign finance reform.<ref name=jbenters/> In 1996, Brown unsuccessfully urged Oakland mayor [[Elihu Harris]] to appoint him to a seat on the Oakland Port Commission.<ref name=jbenters/>

==Mayor of Oakland (1999–2007)==

After Oakland mayor Elihu Harris decided against seeking reelection,<ref name=jbenters/> Brown ran in the city's [[1998 Oakland mayoral election|1998 mayoral election]] as an independent "having left the Democratic Party, blasting what he called the 'deeply corrupted' [[two-party system]]".<ref name="mercurynews1"/> He won with 59% of the vote in a field of ten candidates.<ref name="mercurynews1"/>

Prior to taking office, Brown campaigned to get the approval of the electorate to convert Oakland's [[Mayor-council government|"weak mayor" political structure]], which structured the mayor as chairman of the city council and official greeter, to a "[[strong mayor]]" structure, where the mayor would act as chief executive over the nonpolitical and thus the various city departments, and break tie votes on the Oakland City Council.<ref name="mercurynews1"/> In November of 1998, Oakland's electorate voted by a landslide margin of 3 to 1 in support of Measure X, which would shift the city government to the strong mayor model for a period of 6 years.<ref>{{cite web |last1=DelVecchio |first1=Rick |last2=Holtz |first2=Debra Levi |title=Measure X Victory for Jerry Brown / Strong-mayor initiative OKd by Oakland voters |url=http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Measure-X-Victory-for-Jerry-Brown-Strong-mayor-2981070.php |publisher=SFGate |access-date=12 December 2019 |date=4 November 1998}}</ref><ref name=morethanmayorormanager>{{cite book |last1=Svara |first1=James H. |last2=Watson |first2=Douglas J. |title=More than Mayor or Manager: Campaigns to Change Form of Government in America's Large Cities |date=2010 |publisher=Georgetown University Press |isbn=978-1-58901-620-0 |pages=121–138 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZUDsPHOnkGEC |access-date=12 December 2019 |language=en}}</ref> A referendum permanently extending Measure X later passed in 2004, after failing to pass in 2002, thus making permanent the city's shift to the strong mayor model of governance.<ref name=morethanmayorormanager/>

The political left had hoped for some of the more progressive politics from Brown's earlier governorship, but found Brown, as mayor, to be "more pragmatic than progressive, more interested in downtown redevelopment and economic growth than political ideology".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/johnson/article/City-awaits-word-from-Dellums-2604062.php|title=City awaits word from Dellums |work=San Francisco Chronicle |date=October 7, 2005 |access-date=November 18, 2017 |first=Chip |last=Johnson}}</ref> As mayor, he invited the [[U.S. Marine Corps]] to use Oakland harbor lands for mock military exercises as part of [[Operation Urban Warrior]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Lee |first1=Henry K. |last2=Hamburg |first2=Laura |title=War Games Come Ashore In East Bay / Chanting protesters greet Marines and helicopters |url=http://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/War-Games-Come-Ashore-In-East-Bay-Chanting-2941929.php |access-date=November 18, 2017 |newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle |date=March 16, 1999}}</ref>

The city was rapidly losing residents and businesses, and Brown is credited with starting the revitalization of the city using his connections and experience to lessen the economic downturn while attracting $1 billion of investments, including refurbishing the [[Fox Theater (Oakland)|Fox Theatre]], the [[Port of Oakland]], and [[Jack London Square]].<ref name="mercurynews1"/> The downtown district was losing retailers, restaurateurs and residential developers, and Brown sought to attract thousands of new residents with [[disposable income]] to revitalize the area.<ref name="increasing housing">{{cite news|url=http://www.sfchronicle.com/politics/article/CAMPAIGN-2006-Oakland-Mayor-Candidates-agree-2541221.php |title=CAMPAIGN 2006: Oakland Mayor / Candidates agree on increasing housing / They differ on how to assist middle-, low-income families|work=San Francisco Chronicle |date=February 19, 2006 |access-date=November 18, 2017 |first=Christopher |last=Heredia}}</ref> Brown continued his predecessor Elihu Harris's public policy of supporting downtown housing development in the area defined as the [[Central Business District]] in Oakland's 1998 General Plan.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.eastbayexpress.com/news/inflating_the_numbers/Content?oid=323334 |title=Inflating the Numbers, The Brown administration came very close on the 10K Plan.

The [[10K Plan|10K plan]] has touched the historic [[Old Oakland]] district, the [[Chinatown, Oakland, California|Chinatown]] district, the [[Uptown Oakland|Uptown]] district, and [[Downtown Oakland|Downtown]]. Brown surpassed the stated goal of attracting 10,000 residents according to city records, and built more [[affordable housing]] than previous mayoral administrations.<ref name="increasing housing" />

Brown had campaigned on fixing Oakland's schools, but "bureaucratic battles" dampened his efforts. He concedes he never had control of the schools, and his reform efforts were "largely a bust".<ref name="mercurynews1" /> He focused instead on the creation of two [[charter school]]s, the [[Oakland School for the Arts]] and the [[Oakland Military Institute]].<ref name="mercurynews1" /> Defending his support of a military charter school in Oakland, Brown once told KQED reporter Stephen Talbot, "I believe that had I been sent to the military academy, as my mother and father threatened, I would have been president a long time ago."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAfltGwzgpI|title=Educating Oakland: Jerry Brown Re-Invents Himself as Mayor of Oakland|via=www.youtube.com}}</ref>

Brown's largely successful first term as mayor of Oakland was documented in a one-hour KQED documentary, "The Celebrity and the City" (2001) that evaluated his record in dealing with his four stated goals: reducing crime, improving education, attracting 10,000 new residents to a resurgent downtown, and encouraging the arts.<ref>{{cite web|last=Talbot|first=Stephen|title=The Celebrity and the City|work=KQED|url=http://cironline.org/blog/post/no-2nd-acts-politics-4-clips-look-back-jerry-browns-career-6423|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160122062452/http://cironline.org/blog/post/no-2nd-acts-politics-4-clips-look-back-jerry-browns-career-6423|archive-date=January 22, 2016|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

==Attorney General of California (2007–2011)==
{{main|2006 California Attorney General election}}
[[File:JerryBrownByPhilKonstantin.jpg|150px|left|thumb|Brown in 2009]]
In 2004, Brown expressed interest to be a candidate for the Democratic nomination for [[Attorney General of California]] in the 2006 election, and in May 2004, he formally filed to run. He defeated his Democratic primary opponent, Los Angeles City Attorney [[Rocky Delgadillo]], 63% to 37%. In the general election, Brown defeated Republican State Senator [[Charles Poochigian]] 56.3% to 38.2%, one of the largest margins of victory in any statewide California race.<ref name="McPherson-sov">{{cite web|last=McPherson|first=Bruce |author-link=Bruce McPherson|url=http://www.ss.ca.gov/elections/sov/2006_general/complete_sov.pdf|title="Statement of Vote", 2006|work=Elections & Voter Information|publisher=California Secretary of State's Office|access-date=June 12, 2007|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070107113900/http://www.ss.ca.gov/elections/sov/2006_general/complete_sov.pdf|archive-date=January 7, 2007|df=mdy-all}}</ref> In the final weeks leading up to Election Day, Brown's eligibility to run for attorney general was challenged in what Brown called a "political stunt by a Republican office seeker" ([[Contra Costa County]] Republican Central Committee chairman and state GOP vice-chair candidate Tom Del Beccaro). Plaintiffs claimed Brown did not meet eligibility according to California Government Code §12503, "No person shall be eligible to the office of Attorney General unless he shall have been admitted to practice before the Supreme Court of the state for a period of at least five years immediately preceding his election or appointment to such office." Legal analysts called the lawsuit frivolous because Brown was admitted to practice law in the State of California on June 14, 1965, and had been so admitted to practice ever since. Although ineligible to practice law because of his voluntary inactive status in the [[State Bar of California]] from January 1, 1997, to May 1, 2003, he was nevertheless still admitted to practice. Because of this difference the case was eventually thrown out.<ref name="metnews-ed">{{cite news|url=http://www.metnews.com/articles/2006/editorial102006.htm|title=Editorial: GOP Volunteers Disgrace Party by Opposition to Kennard, Suit Against Brown|work=[[Metropolitan News-Enterprise]]|page=6|date=October 23, 2006|access-date=June 12, 2007}}</ref><ref name="Richman">{{cite news|first=Josh|last=Richman|url=http://www.insidebayarea.com/search/ci_5201111|title=Judge dismisses suit against Brown|work=Oakland Tribune|date=February 10, 2007|access-date=June 12, 2007}}</ref>

=== Death penalty ===

As attorney general, Brown represented the state in fighting death-penalty appeals and stated that he would follow the law, regardless of his personal beliefs against [[capital punishment]]. Capital punishment by [[lethal injection]] was halted in California by federal judge [[Jeremy D.

=== Mortgage fraud lawsuit ===

In June 2008, Brown filed a fraud lawsuit claiming mortgage lender [[Countrywide Financial]] engaged in "unfair and deceptive" practices to get homeowners to apply for risky mortgages far beyond their means.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/business/chi-mortgage_suit_25jun25,0,3774900.story |title=State's suit to target mortgage lender for unfair practices |work=Chicago Tribune |date=June 25, 2008 |access-date=June 25, 2008 }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/business/sns-ap-countrywide-illinois-lawsuit,0,4219028.story |title=Illinois AG sues Countrywide over lending practices |agency=Associated Press |date=June 25, 2008 |access-date=June 25, 2008 |work=Chicago Tribune |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080628162101/http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/sns-ap-countrywide-illinois-lawsuit%2C0%2C4219028.story |archive-date=June 28, 2008 |df=mdy-all}}</ref> Brown accused the lender of breaking the state's laws against [[false advertising]] and unfair business practices.

Brown was sworn in for his third term as governor on January 3, 2011, succeeding Republican [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] who had been term-limited. Brown was working on a budget that would shift many government programs from the state to the local level, a reversal of trends from his first tenure as governor.<ref>Jesse McKinley.

In September 2012, Brown signed legislation sponsored by California State Senator [[Ted Lieu]] that prohibits protesters at funerals within 300 feet, with convicted violators punishable with fines and jail time; the legislation was in response to protests conducted by the [[Westboro Baptist Church]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Calif. law distances protesters from funerals |agency=Associated Press |url=http://www.armytimes.com/mobile/news/2012/09/ap-california-law-distances-protesters-from-funerals-091712 |newspaper=Army Times |date=September 17, 2013 |access-date=February 24, 2013}}</ref>

In the November 2012 general elections, voters approved Brown's proposed tax increases in the form of [[California Proposition 30 (2012)|Proposition 30]]. Prop 30 raised the state personal income tax increase over seven years for California residents with an annual income over US$250,000 and increased in the state sales tax by 0.25 percent over four years. It allowed the state to avoid nearly $6 billion in cuts to public education.<ref name=KPCC>{{cite news|last=Abdollah|first=Tami|title=Prop. 30 winning; what's next for schools, taxes|url=http://www.scpr.org/blogs/politics/2012/11/07/10949/prop-30-election-taxes-California-schools-votes/|access-date=November 10, 2012|publisher=KPCC|date=November 7, 2012}}</ref>

Brown announced his bid for re-election on February 27, 2014. On June 3, he came first in the primary election by over 1.5 million votes. He received 54.3% of the vote and advanced to the general election with Republican [[Neel Kashkari]], who took 19.38% of the vote.

There was only one gubernatorial debate. When asked to schedule another, Brown declined.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/06/us/politics/in-california-governors-race-jerry-brown-risks-little.html|title=In California Governor's Race, the Risks of Running a Low-Risk Campaign |format=web|access-date=September 27, 2014}}</ref> During the debate in Sacramento on September 4, 2014, Kashkari accused Brown of failing to improve California's business climate. His leading example was the [[Tesla Motors]] factory investment, creating 6,500 manufacturing jobs, going to Nevada rather than California. Brown responded that the cash payment upfront required by the investment would have been unfair to California taxpayers.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Williams|first1=Juliet|title=Brown, Kashkari clash over education, business climate in only California governor's debate |url=https://www.usnews.com/news/politics/articles/2014/09/05/brown-slammed-over-tesla-in-california-debate|agency=[[Associated Press]]|access-date=September 10, 2014}}</ref> A range of issues were debated, including recent legislation for a [[Phase-out of lightweight plastic bags#California|ban on plastic bags]] at grocery stores that Brown promised to sign and Kashkari thought unimportant.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/06/us/politics/in-california-governors-race-jerry-brown-risks-little.html |title=In California Governor's Race, the Risks of Running a Low-Risk Campaign |newspaper=The New York Times |date=September 6, 2014 |access-date=September 27, 2014}}</ref>

Brown said that if he were elected to a fourth and final term, he would continue transferring power to local authorities, particularly over education and criminal justice policy, and would resist fellow Democrats' "gold rush for new programs and spending".<ref name=buildon/>

In the general election, Brown was re-elected by 3,645,835 votes (59.2%) to Kashkari's 2,511,722 (40.8%). His stated goals for his unprecedented fourth term in office were to construct the [[California High-Speed Rail]], to create [[Bay Delta Conservation Plan|tunnels to shore up the state's water system]] and to curb carbon dioxide emissions. He still had $20 million in campaign funds to advance his ballot measures in case the legislature didn't support his plans.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-11-10/jerry-brown-sets-california-on-a-course-of-public-works.html |title=Jerry Brown Sets California on a Course of Public Works |publisher=Bloomberg |date=November 10, 2014 |access-date=November 11, 2014}}</ref>

In October 2015, Brown signed off the [[California End of Life Option Act]] allowing residents of California who fulfilled strict criteria to exercise the [[right to die]] by accessing [[medical aid in dying]]. During the sign off he took the unusual step of adding a personal message indicating his dilemma regarding the consideration of the ethical issues involved and stating that he felt unable to deny the right of choice to others.<ref name="nyt2017">{{cite web|last1=Lovett|first1=Ian|last2=Perez-Pena|first2=Richard|title=California Governor Signs Assisted Suicide Bill Into Law|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/06/us/california-governor-signs-assisted-suicide-bill-into-law.html|website=New York Times|access-date=6 September 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Brown|first1=Edmund G.|title=Letter to the members of the California State Assembley|url=https://www.gov.ca.gov/docs/ABX2_15_Signing_Message.pdf|website=Office of Governor Edmund G.

On December 18, 2015, Brown moved into the Historic Governor's Mansion, now part of [[Governor's Mansion State Historic Park]].

In the 2018–19 budget plan that Brown released on January 10, 2018, the Governor proposed spending $120 million to establish California's first fully online community college by fall 2019.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Teresa|first1=Wantanabe|title=Gov.

Legislative accomplishments in Brown's final term include passing [[California Senate Bill 54 (2017)|California Sanctuary Law SB 54]], which prevents police from complying with most requests by the [[U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement]] (ICE) to hold illegal immigrants for deportation; [[California Senate Bill 32]], which requires the state to reduce [[greenhouse gas]] emissions to 40% below 1990 levels by 2030, extending the state's cap and trade system (which had originally been outlined by the [[Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006]]) to achieve this goal; and passing the [[Road Repair and Accountability Act]].

Beginning in 1995, Brown hosted a daily call-in talk show on the local [[Pacifica Radio]] station, [[KPFA]]-FM, in [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]] broadcast to major U.S. markets.<ref name="salon1996"/> Both the radio program and Brown's political action organization, based in [[Oakland, California|Oakland]], were called ''We the People''.<ref name="salon1996"/> His programs, usually featuring invited guests, generally explored alternative views on a wide range of social and political issues, from education and health care to spirituality and the death penalty.<ref name="salon1996"/>

The official [[gubernatorial portrait of Jerry Brown]], commemorating his first period as Governor of California, was painted by [[Don Bachardy]] and unveiled in 1984. The painting has long been controversial due to its departure from the traditional norms of portraiture.<ref name="KlossSkvarla2002">{{cite book |author1=William Kloss |author2=Diane K.

Brown has a long-term friendship with his aide Jacques Barzaghi<!-- Q103007833 -->, whom he met in the early 1970s and put on his payroll. Author Roger Rapaport wrote in his 1982 Brown biography ''California Dreaming: The Political Odyssey of Pat & Jerry Brown'', "This combination clerk, chauffeur, fashion consultant, decorator, and trusted friend had no discernible powers. Yet, late at night, after everyone had gone home to their families and TV consoles, it was Jacques who lingered in the Secretary (of state's) office." Barzaghi and his sixth spouse Aisha lived with Brown in the warehouse in Jack London Square; Barzaghi was brought into Oakland city government upon Brown's election as mayor, where Barzaghi first acted as the mayor's armed bodyguard. Barzaghi left Brown's staff in July 2004, six days after police had responded to his residence over a complaint of domestic violence.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sfchronicle.com/politics/article/OAKLAND-Barzaghi-leaves-Jerry-Brown-s-staff-2740217.php|authors=Steve Rubenstein and Janine DeFeo|title=Barzaghi Departs Jerry Brown Staff|work=San Francisco Chronicle |date=July 20, 2004 |access-date=November 18, 2017}}</ref>
