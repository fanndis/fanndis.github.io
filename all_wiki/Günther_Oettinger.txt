'''Günther Hermann Oettinger''' (born 15 October 1953) is a German politician and a member of the [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|Christian Democratic Union]] (CDU). He served as the [[European Commissioner for Budget and Human Resources]] from 2017 to 2019,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/commission/2014-2019/oettinger_en|title=Günther Oettinger - European Commission - European Commission|first=Piotr|last=Przybylski|date=1 September 2015}}</ref> as [[European Commissioner for Digital Economy and Society]] from 2014 to 2016 and as [[European Commissioner for Energy]] from 2010 to 2014.

He is affiliated with the [[European People's Party]] (EPP). He served as [[Minister-President]] of [[Baden-Württemberg]] between 2005 and 2010 and as chairman of the [[CDU Baden-Württemberg]] from 2005 until 2010.

==Early life and education==
Oettinger studied Law and Economics at the [[University of Tübingen]]. He worked in an accounting and tax consulting business, before being licensed in 1984 to practice law and worked in this sector until 1988.

==Political career==
Oettinger embarked in politics as a member of the [[Junge Union]], the youth organisation of the [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|CDU]]; he was chairman of the organization in Baden-Württemberg from 1983 to 1989.  From 2001 to 2005 he served as Chairman of the CDU Party in Nordwürttemberg (North Württemberg), and has also been CDU Chairman of the Federal Committee for Media Politics.
Oettinger was elected as a Member of the State Parliament (''Landtag'') of Baden-Württemberg in 1984. From 1991 to 2005 he was Leader of the CDU Parliamentary Group.

===Minister President of Baden-Württemberg, 2004–10===
In October 2004 the Minister President of Baden-Württemberg [[Erwin Teufel]] announced that he was to step down as Minister President and Chairman of the Baden-Württemberg CDU, effective 19 April 2005. Oettinger was elected as his successor by CDU internal party pre-elections. His referendum win – with 60.6 percent of the vote versus 39.4 percent for state Education Minister [[Annette Schavan]] – was widely seen at the time as a defeat for Teufel, who had promoted Schavan as his preferred successor.

On 29 April 2005, Oettinger became Chairman of the CDU in Baden-Württemberg, eight days after succeeding Teufel as Minister President. In 2006 the CDU held onto their majority in the [[2006 Baden-Württemberg state election|Baden-Württemberg state election]]; Oettinger was re-elected Minister President. Oettinger headed a coalition regional government comprising CDU and [[Freie Demokratische Partei|FDP]] members.

Oettinger was a CDU delegate to the [[Federal Convention (Germany)|Federal Convention]] for the purpose of electing the [[President of Germany]] in 2004 and 2009. Between 2007 and 2009, he served as co-chair (alongside [[Peter Struck]]) of the [[Federalism commission (Germany)|Second Commission on the modernization of the federal state]] (''Föderalismuskommission II''), which had been established to reform the division of powers between federal and state authorities in Germany.

Following the [[2009 German federal election|2009 federal elections]], Oettinger was part of the CDU/CSU team in the negotiations with the FDP on a coalition agreement; he joined the working group on economic affairs and energy policy, led by [[Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg]] and [[Rainer Brüderle]]. On 24 October 2009, [[Angela Merkel]]'s new centre-right [[Second Merkel cabinet|coalition government]] chose Oettinger to be a Commissioner of the European Commission. He took office on 10 February 2010, the same day he stepped down as Minister President of Baden-Württemberg.

In a leaked diplomatic cable from the [[Embassy of the United States, Berlin|United States Embassy]] entitled "Lame Duck German Governor Kicked Upstairs as New Energy Commissioner in Brussels," U.S. Deputy Chief of Mission in Germany, Greg Delawie notes: "Chancellor Angela Merkel nominated Baden-Wuerttemberg (BW) Minister President Guenther Oettinger as EU Energy Commissioner primarily to remove an unloved lame duck from an important CDU bastion". Delawie's cable further states: "Oettinger is noted for a lackluster public speaking-style, and some commentators have asserted that Merkel, who has often stood out at EU meetings, wanted to appoint a German Commissioner who would not outshine her!"

===Vice-President of the European Commission in charge of Energy, 2010–14===
In the Second [[Barroso Commission]], Oettinger was allocated the [[Energy]] portfolio, which had just grown in importance after the [[Lisbon Treaty]] gave the EU complete authority in the area.<ref name="auto">[http://www.euractiv.com/priorities/oettinger-defends-european-visio-news-223382 Oettinger defends European vision on energy] ''[[EurActiv]]'', 15 January 2010.</ref>

At his confirmation hearing before the [[European Parliament]] in 2010, Oettinger pledged to enforce the principle of solidarity on energy policy as enshrined in the EU's [[Lisbon Treaty]] so that no member state could be left disadvantaged. He struck a chord with parliamentarians by basing his security of supply strategy equally on diversifying [[gas]] transportation routes from third countries and promoting indigenous renewable energy.<ref name="auto"/> Asked about his stance on [[nuclear power|nuclear energy]] Oettinger said that although his country Germany sees nuclear as a bridging technology, he had no reservations against France's plans to build more nuclear capacity nor Austria's decision to abandon the technology altogether.<ref name="auto"/>

The first phase of Oettinger's term was dominated by the [[Nabucco pipeline]] debate, his many trips to Azerbaijan and the Caspian region as well as his negotiations with Russian energy company [[Gazprom]]. Oettinger lobbied both for the Nabucco pipeline and the [[Trans Adriatic Pipeline]], arguing they will be needed in the medium-term as routes to help secure European gas supply.<ref>Michael Shields (5 July 2013), [https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/07/05/gas-pipeline-eu-idUSL5N0FB0EY20130705 EU's Oettinger says Nabucco route not dead -newspaper] ''[[Reuters]]''.</ref> The second phase began with the [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster]] in 2011 and the resulting [[energy transition]] in Germany.<ref name="auto1">Dario Sarmadi (25 June 2014), [http://www.euractiv.com/sections/eu-elections-2014/germanys-top-eu-official-brussels-wins-backing-second-term-303039 Germany's top EU official in Brussels wins backing for second term] ''[[EurActiv]]''.</ref> Oettinger advised that there should be no new taxes on energy within the EU, and current taxes should not be raised, if prices are to be kept competitive with rivals fuelled by cheaper [[shale gas]] in the US.<ref>Fiona Harvey (28 March 2013), [http://www.euractiv.com/energy/eu-energy-chief-calls-new-taxes-news-518794 Oettinger calls for no new taxes as talks begin on 2030 climate targets] ''[[EurActiv]]''.</ref>

Throughout his time in office, Oettinger regularly made headlines for his comments on constituent EU member countries' economic situations. In remarks published by German media in May 2013, he expressed doubts about France's economic recovery and said "too many in Europe still believe that everything will be fine." France, he said, "is completely unprepared to do what’s necessary," while Italy, Bulgaria and Romania "are essentially ungovernable."<ref>Andrew Higgins and James Kanter (29 May 2013), [https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/30/business/global/eu-proposes-giving-countries-time-to-cut-deficits.html E.U. States Win Leeway on Deficits] ''[[New York Times]]''.</ref> Oettinger has also repeatedly been in conflict with the German government.<ref name="auto1"/> In an interview with ''[[Die Welt]]'' in 2014, he criticized the German Federal Government's plan to allow longer-serving employees to retire at the age of 63 for the message this sent to cash-strapped peripheral eurozone states like Greece, Spain and Portugal.<ref>Alice Ross (21 April 2014), [http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/d808f79e-c943-11e3-bba1-00144feabdc0.html Germany attacked over plan to cut retirement age] ''[[Financial Times]]''.</ref>

In mid-2014, Oettinger led high-level talks in order to facilitate a deal under which Ukraine would pay Russia $3.1 billion amid a dispute over unpaid Russian gas bills and Russia would deliver the gas Ukraine needs for the winter.<ref>Anton Troianovski (27 September 2014), [https://www.wsj.com/articles/russia-ukraine-close-in-on-deal-to-resolve-gas-dispute-1411748203 Russia, Ukraine Close In on Deal to Resolve Gas Dispute] ''[[Wall Street Journal]]''.</ref>

===Commissioner for Digital Economy and Society, 2014–2016===
Following the [[2014 European Parliament election in Germany|2014 European elections]], both governing parties in Germany – the [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany|Christian Democratic Union]] (CDU) and the [[Social Democratic Party]] (SPD) – backed Oettinger to remain as the German EU Commissioner in the incoming European Commission.<ref name="auto1"/> At first, Oettinger was widely considered to be a leading candidate to take the position of [[European Commissioner for Trade]], as German Chancellor [[Angela Merkel]] was said to consider the negotiations over the controversial [[TTIP]] to be one of the most important projects for growth in this legislative term.<ref>Jeevan Vasagar and Christian Oliver (4 August 2014), [http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/bcb8ab98-1bdb-11e4-adc7-00144feabdc0.html Germany seeks to limit investor protection to save trade deal] ''[[Financial Times]]''.</ref><ref>[http://www.euractiv.com/sections/eu-elections-2014/oettinger-interested-eu-trade-commissioner-post-308060 Oettinger interested in Trade Commissioner post] ''[[EurActiv]]'', 29 August 2014.</ref><ref>Peter Spiegel, Alex Barker and Christian Oliver (2 September 2014), [http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/c1fc4876-328d-11e4-a5a2-00144feabdc0.html European Commission top jobs: The runners and riders] ''[[Financial Times]]''.</ref> Instead, Jean-Claude Juncker, President-elect of the European Commission, nominated Oettinger as Commissioner for Digital Economy and Society.<ref>James Kanter (10 September 2014), [https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/11/business/international/jean-claude-juncker-names-european-commissioners.html Jean-Claude Juncker Names European Commissioners] ''[[New York Times]]''.</ref>

In this capacity, Oettinger was in charge of the Commission's department for communications networks, content and technology. His department gained considerable powers as part of Juncker's administrative reshuffle, including over the fight against counterfeiting, piracy and copyright. He shared competency over cyber-security matters with [[Dimitris Avramopoulos]].<ref>Nicholas Hirst (11 December 2014), [http://www.politico.eu/article/whos-who-in-the-digital-world/ Who’s who in the digital world] ''[[European Voice]]''.</ref>

'''Data protection'''

In a nod to European concerns over data protection, Oettinger expressed his support for stiffer rules currently under consideration that would provide Europeans with a greater say over how their online data is used by the likes of [[Google]], [[Facebook]] and other internet companies.<ref name="auto2">Mark Scott (29 September 2014), [http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/09/29/nominee-for-european-digital-job-explains-positions-in-hearing/ Nominee for European Digital Job Explains Positions in Hearing] ''[[New York Times]]''.</ref> He also supported the legal principle known as the "[[right to be forgotten]]", in which people have the right to ask that search engines no longer produce certain irrelevant or out-of-date information, when a search is done on the basis of the person's name [[internet search]]es.<ref name="auto2"/> Pushing for a credible global common understanding on confidential and personal information of citizens around the world, Oettinger called for the establishment of a UN agency for data protection and data security.<ref>Graeme Wearden and Jill Treanor (22 January 2015), [https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jan/22/un-agency-data-protection-davos-edward-snowden UN needs agency for data protection, European commissioner tells Davos] ''[[The Guardian]]''.</ref>

'''Economic policy'''

In an op-ed published in both the ''[[Financial Times]]'' and ''[[Les Échos (France)|Les Échos]]'' in November 2014, Oettinger questioned whether President [[François Hollande]] had the "willingness to act" to reform the French economy<ref>Peter Spiegel (20 November 2014), [http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/aebafcf0-70d4-11e4-85d5-00144feabdc0.html Germany’s EU commissioner doubts Hollande’s reforms] ''[[Financial Times]]''.</ref> and said the Commission should insist France undertake "concrete and quantifiable measures coupled with precise deadlines" as a condition for a fresh deficit extension;<ref>Ingrid Melander (20 November 2014), [http://uk.reuters.com/article/2014/11/20/us-france-economy-fine-idUKKCN0J40PW20141120 French finance minister says prospect of EU fines 'not an issue'] ''[[Reuters]]''.</ref> in response, members of the French Socialists called for Oettinger to resign.<ref>Aline Robert (21 November 2014), [http://www.euractiv.com/sections/euro-finance/french-socialists-call-oettinger-resign-310235 French Socialists call for Oettinger to resign] ''[[EurActiv]]''.</ref>

===Commissioner for Budget and Human Resources, 2017–2019===

On 1 January 2017 Oettinger was reassigned to the Budget and Human Resources portfolio, following the resignation of [[Kristalina Georgieva]] with effect from 31 December 2016 to take up a new position as chief executive officer of the [[World Bank]].

==Life after politics==
In 2019, Oettinger and Friederike Beyer jointly set up Oettinger Consulting, a Hamburg-based advisory firm.<ref>Andreas Müller (27 July 2019), [https://www.stuttgarter-zeitung.de/inhalt.zukunft-von-guenther-oettinger-oettinger-consulting-steht-in-den-startloechern.f6b113d5-d332-47f2-b0b9-bb592a2549af.html Zukunft von Günther Oettinger: "Oettinger Consulting“ steht in den Startlöchern] ''[[Stuttgarter Zeitung]]''.</ref>

==Controversies==

===Eulogy controversy===
On 11 April 2007, Oettinger gave a controversial eulogy on one of his predecessors as Minister President of Baden-Württemberg, [[Hans Filbinger]]. Filbinger had been forced to resign in 1978 after allegations surfaced about his role as a navy lawyer and [[judge]] during the Second World War. He died on 1 April at the age of 93.

In his speech at the memorial service at [[Freiburg]], Oettinger described Filbinger as "not a National-Socialist" but as "an opponent of the Nazi régime", who "could flee the constraints of the régime as little as millions of others". Referring to Filbinger's role as a naval judge, Oettinger pointed out that no lives were taken by Filbinger's verdicts and that he did not wield the power and freedom suggested by his critics.<ref>[http://www.fr-online.de/_img/_cnt/_online/070413_1705_filbinger_rede.doc Full text of Oettinger's eulogy for Hans Filbinger (in German)]{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} ([[Microsoft Word]] document, 232&nbsp;[[kilobyte|KB]]). ''Frankfurter Rundschau'', 12 April 2007.</ref> Oettinger was subsequently accused by politicians and the media of playing down the significance of the [[Nazi]] dictatorship. German [[Chancellor of Germany (Federal Republic)|Chancellor]] [[Angela Merkel]] reacted by publicly admonishing him, stating that she would have preferred for "the critical questions" not to be raised.<ref>[https://www.tagesschau.de/aktuell/meldungen/0,1185,OID6618996,00.html "Nach umstrittener Trauerrede zu Filbinger: Merkel rügt Oettinger."]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} ''Tagesschau'' online, 13. April 2007.</ref> Oettinger was also criticized by opposition politicians and the [[Central Council of Jews in Germany]]; some critics even called for his dismissal.

Oettinger at first defended his speech, adding that he regretted any "misunderstanding" over his eulogy although he did not retract his comments about Filbinger's past.<ref>"Eulogy for Former Nazi Prompts Criticism", ''The New York Times'', 14 April 2007 [https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/world/AP-Germany-Nazi-Era-Judge.html]</ref> Later however, on 16 April, he distanced himself from his comments.<ref>[http://www.sueddeutsche.de/,tt2m5/deutschland/artikel/286/110176/ "Oettingers Weltsicht"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070519150122/http://www.sueddeutsche.de/,tt2m5/deutschland/artikel/286/110176/ |date=19 May 2007 }} Süddeutsche Zeitung vom 17 April 2007</ref>

===Flag controversy===
Oettinger suggested that heavily [[debt|indebted]] countries should fly their flag at [[half-mast]] over EU buildings. As a result, several [[Member of the European Parliament|MEPs]] wrote a letter of protest to EU Commission President José Manuel Barroso, demanding his apology or resignation. Oettinger backed down, saying he did not support the idea of flying flags at half-mast.<ref>[http://www.independent.ie/national-news/german-eu-boss-backs-down-on-flag-at-half-mast-bid-2875986.html German EU boss backs down on flag at half mast bid] ''Irish Independent'', 2011-09-14.</ref>

===Energy subsidy controversy===
[[File:Günther Oettinger 2013 Hannover Messe.jpg|thumb|Oettinger at [[Hannover Messe]], 2013]]

In October 2013, Oettinger altered an official report of the [[European Commission]] to hide the fact that conventional and nuclear energies are both more heavily subsidized than renewables. He is convinced that renewables are too expensive and a burden for the economy. To prove his point he had ordered a detailed listing in the Report on Subsidies and Costs of EU Energy 2013. However, in short notice before the report being published, he had the numbers regarding nuclear energy (€35bn / a) and fossil fuels (€66bn / a) erased,<ref>{{cite web|title=Electricity Market.pdf|url=https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B9F6ub8wD7gqQW9vNGtidHZVaUE/edit?pli=1|website=Google Docs|publisher=whistleblower}}</ref> as they showed that each is more heavily subsidized than renewables at €30bn / a. In the final and official report only the numbers for renewables are shown.<ref>{{cite web|title=Delivering the internal electricity market and making the most of public intervention|url=http://ec.europa.eu/energy/sites/ener/files/documents/com_2013_public_intervention_en_0.pdf|website=Single market progress report|publisher=European Commission|accessdate=2015-04-27}}</ref>

===Remarks on Chinese people===
In a speech to business leaders in Hamburg on 26 October 2016, Oettinger referred to Chinese people as "slit-eyes" and "sly dogs". He also stated that it was "consistent" that a Chinese delegation was male-only since China doesn't have female quotas. Oettinger subsequently received criticism both from European sources and a Chinese government spokesman, and several days later issued a statement apologizing for "any remark that was not as respectful as it should have been".<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/04/world/europe/gunther-oettinger-apology-china.html "E.U. Official, Under Pressure for Having Disparaged the Chinese, Apologizes"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', 3 November 2016.

===Intervention in Italian politics===
On 29 May 2018, commenting in an interview with [[Deutsche Welle]] on developments in Italy after the 2018 General Election, Oettinger said "Even now, developments on bond markets, the market value of banks, and Italy's economy in general have darkened noticeably and negatively. That has to do with the possible government formation. I can only hope that this will play a role in the election campaign and send a signal not to hand populists on the right and left any responsibility in government."

European Council President [[Donald Tusk]] and European Commission President [[Jean-Claude Juncker]] immediately distanced themselves from these remarks and Oettinger apologised, explaining "I fully respect the will of voters being left, right or centre and in every country. By referring to actual market developments in Italy, I did not mean to be disrespectful."<ref>[http://www.dw.com/en/eu-chides-budget-commissioner-oettinger-over-italy-remarks/a-43982166 "EU chides budget commissioner Oettinger over Italy remarks"] [[Deutsche Welle]], 29 May 2018.
