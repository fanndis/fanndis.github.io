The '''Rohingya genocide''' is a series of ongoing persecutions by the [[Myanmar government|Myanmar (formerly Burmese) government]] of the [[Rohingya people]]. The genocide has consisted of two phases to date: the first occurred from October 2016 to January 2017 and the second has been occurring since August 2017. The crisis forced over a million Rohingya to flee to other countries. Most fled to [[Bangladesh]], while others escaped to [[India]], [[Thailand]], [[Malaysia]], and other parts of [[South Asia|South]] and [[Southeast Asia]].

The largest wave of Rohingya to flee Myanmar happened in 2017, which resulted in the largest human exodus in Asia since the [[Vietnam War]].<ref>{{Cite web| url=https://apnews.com/8972bde7517d4e7aba770fb124a40726| title=Myanmar attacks, sea voyage rob young father of everything| date=27 October 2017| access-date=17 October 2019| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191017110103/https://apnews.com/8972bde7517d4e7aba770fb124a40726| archive-date=17 October 2019| url-status=live}}</ref> 
The 2016 military crackdown on the Rohingya people drew criticism from the [[United Nations|UN]] (which cited possible "[[crimes against humanity]]"), the human rights group [[Amnesty International]], the [[United States Department of State|U.S. Department of State]], the government of neighbouring [[Bangladesh]], and the government of [[Malaysia]]. The Burmese leader and [[State Counsellor of Myanmar|State Counsellor]] (''de facto'' [[head of government]]) and [[Nobel Peace Prize]] laureate [[Aung San Suu Kyi]] has been criticised for her inaction and silence over the issue and has done little to prevent military abuses.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/31/world/asia/aung-san-suu-kyi-myanmar.html|title=Did the World Get Aung San Suu Kyi Wrong?|first1=Amanda|last1=Taub|first2=Max|last2=Fisher|date=31 October 2017|work=The New York Times|access-date=14 November 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171114095109/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/31/world/asia/aung-san-suu-kyi-myanmar.html|archive-date=14 November 2017|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/10/02/what-happened-to-myanmars-human-rights-icon|title=What Happened to Myanmar's Human-Rights Icon?|first=Hannah|last=Beech|date=25 September 2017|work=The New Yorker|access-date=14 November 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171114145201/https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/10/02/what-happened-to-myanmars-human-rights-icon|archive-date=14 November 2017|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/programmes/dispatches/on-demand/67615-001|title=Dispatches – On Demand – All 4|publisher=Channel 4|access-date=14 May 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180515112236/http://www.channel4.com/programmes/dispatches/on-demand/67615-001|archive-date=15 May 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |last=Cook |first=Jesselyn |date=24 April 2018 |title=Suu Kyi's Silence: Why Myanmar's Leader Is Ignorning the Rohingya |url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/myanmar-suu-kyi-rohingya-genocide_n_5ab14dd7e4b008c9e5f1fc90 |work=HuffPost |access-date=22 May 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200523100143/https://www.huffpost.com/entry/myanmar-suu-kyi-rohingya-genocide_n_5ab14dd7e4b008c9e5f1fc90 |archive-date=23 May 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>The Guardian, 12 November 2018 [https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/nov/12/aung-san-suu-kyi-amnesty-highest-honour-shameful-betrayal amnesty betrayal] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181112211037/https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/nov/12/aung-san-suu-kyi-amnesty-highest-honour-shameful-betrayal |date=12 November 2018 }}</ref> Myanmar has also drawn criticism for the prosecutions of journalists under her leadership.<ref name=":0" />

Using statistical extrapolations based on surveys conducted with a total of 3,321 Rohingya refugee households in [[Cox's Bazar]], Bangladesh, a study estimated in January 2018 that the military and local [[Rakhine people|Rakhine]] Buddhists killed at least 24,000 Rohingya people and perpetrated gang rapes and other forms of sexual violence against 18,000 Rohingya Muslim women and girls; 116,000 Rohingya were beaten, and 36,000 were thrown into fires.<ref name="OntarioInternationalDevelopmentAgency">{{Cite book|url=https://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/7857480|title=Forced migration of Rohingya: the untold experience|first1=Mohshin|last1=Habib|first2=Christine|last2=Jubb|first3=Salahuddin|last3=Ahmad|first4=Masudur|last4=Rahman|first5=Henri|last5=Pallard|date=18 July 2018|publisher=Ontario International Development Agency, Canada|via=National Library of Australia (new catalog)|isbn=9780986681516|access-date=26 July 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190717053221/https://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/7857480|archive-date=17 July 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="chief-bangladesh">{{Cite web|url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/07/chief-bangladesh-continue-hosting-rohingya-190710191318011.html|title=Former UN chief says Bangladesh cannot continue hosting Rohingya|website=Al Jazeera|access-date=26 July 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190726151428/https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/07/chief-bangladesh-continue-hosting-rohingya-190710191318011.html|archive-date=26 July 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="dutch-probe">{{Cite web|url=https://www.thedailystar.net/rohingya-crisis/news/dutch-house-representatives-adopts-motion-probe-rohingya-genocide-1767124|title=Dutch House of Representatives adopts motion for probe on Rohingya genocide|date=5 July 2019|website=The Daily Star|access-date=26 July 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190717073035/https://www.thedailystar.net/rohingya-crisis/news/dutch-house-representatives-adopts-motion-probe-rohingya-1767124|archive-date=17 July 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="bangladeshi-pm">{{Cite web|url=https://thefrontierpost.com/bangladeshi-pm-calls-for-safe-repatriation-of-rohingya/|title=Bangladeshi PM calls for safe repatriation of Rohingya|date=4 April 2019|access-date=26 July 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190717061230/https://thefrontierpost.com/bangladeshi-pm-calls-for-safe-repatriation-of-rohingya/|archive-date=17 July 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="un-horrific">{{Cite web|url=https://www.transcend.org/tms/2019/02/un-official-cites-horrific-crimes-against-rohingya/|title=UN Official Cites Horrific Crimes against Rohingya|website=TRANSCEND Media Service|access-date=26 July 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190717055725/https://www.transcend.org/tms/2019/02/un-official-cites-horrific-crimes-against-rohingya/|archive-date=17 July 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="rg-violence">{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/333118905|title=Prevalence of violence against children: Evidence from 2017 Rohingya Refugee crises|last=Khan|first=Ahmed|website=ResearchGate|access-date=14 August 2019}}</ref>

The military operations displaced a large number of people that spurred a refugee crisis. According to UN reports, over 700,000 people had fled or had been driven out of Rakhine State and took shelter in neighbouring [[Bangladesh]] as refugees as of September 2018. In December 2017, two [[Reuters]] journalists who were covering the [[Inn Din massacre]] were arrested and imprisoned. Foreign Secretary [[Myint Thein|Myint Thu]] told reporters Myanmar was prepared to accept 2,000 Rohingya refugees from camps in Bangladesh in November 2018.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thethaiger.com/news/regional/myanmar-prepares-for-the-repatriation-of-2000-rohingya|title=Myanmar prepares for the repatriation of 2,000 Rohingya|website=The Thaiger|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181101055259/https://thethaiger.com/news/regional/myanmar-prepares-for-the-repatriation-of-2000-rohingya|archive-date=1 November 2018|url-status=live|access-date=1 November 2018|date=November 2018}}</ref>

Members of the Rohingya community in particular reportedly face abuses by the Government of Burma, including those involving torture, unlawful arrest and detention, restricted movement, restrictions on religious practice, and discrimination in employment and access to social services.

In March 2017, a police document obtained by [[Reuters]] listed 423 Rohingyas detained by the police since 9 October 2016, 13 of whom were children, the youngest being ten years old. Two police captains in Maungdaw verified the document and justified the arrests; one of them said, "We the police have to arrest those who collaborated with the attackers, children or not, but the court will decide if they are guilty; we are not the ones who decide." Burmese police also claimed that the children had confessed to their alleged crimes during interrogations and that they were not beaten or pressured during questioning.

On 23 April 2019, a Burmese gunship strafed the Rohingya village of [[Buthidaung]].

In early April 2020, the government of [[Myanmar]] released two presidential directives: Directive No. 1/2020 and Directive No. 2/2020. They were followed by the January orders issued by [[ICJ]] for the government and military to stop [[genocide]] against the [[Rohingya]] Muslim ethnic group. Directive No. 1/2020 legislates that the answerable authorities are liable to ensure anyone under their control do not commit activities that lead up to a genocide. Directive No. 2/2020 restrains all Ministries and the government of Rakhine State from destroying The ICJ’s January order and also mandated the preservation of evidence of any criminal activity that can possibly build up to a genocide.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/04/09/myanmars-directives-not-enough-protect-rohingya-0|title=Myanmar's Directives Not Enough to Protect Rohingya|accessdate=9 April 2020|website=Human Rights Watch|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200519092621/https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/04/09/myanmars-directives-not-enough-protect-rohingya-0|archive-date=19 May 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>

=== Attack on media ===
Since the 25 August incident, Myanmar blocked media access and the visits of international bodies to Rakhine State.

== Media coverage ==
{{refimprove section|date=October 2020}}
=== Media coverage in Myanmar ===

The Myanmar government has instructed media sources to not include issues regarding the Rohingya in 2014. Specifically, the Editor in Chief of the Myanmar Times sends a memo to his editorial team stating:

'... no material is to be run in any of our newspapers with regard to the Rohingya, Bengalis, Muslims and Buddhists and the ongoing issues in Rakhine without direct approval from my desk... Our coverage is unlikely to matter substantively in the scheme of things and there appears little sense in placing our heads on the block right at this time...’<ref name="Green, Penny 2015">Green, Penny. Countdown to Annihilation: Genocide in Myanmar. International State Crime Initiative, 2015.</ref>{{page number|date=October 2020}}

According to Aung Zaw, who is the founder and editor of Irrawaddy magazine states that Burmese reporters are told by their editors  to use caution or ignore the Rohingya issue completely when reporting. Zaw attributes the self-censorship to potential international backlash the Myanmar government may face when reporting on the Rohingya. The Rakhine authorities have secluded the Rohingya as much has possible from Myanmar society and from international visitors. Rohingya that have been known to have spoken to UN Special Reporters or journalists have been arrested and/or beaten for giving their accounts.<ref name="Green, Penny 2015"/>{{page number|date=October 2020}}

=== Media coverage in other countries ===

Coverage on the Rohingya crisis in different countries is reported on in different ways. In his dissertation, Md Khadimul Islam qualitatively examined 50 news reports and quantitatively examined 258 news reports of [[Bangladesh]], [[India]] and [[China]]. Islam found that news reports from India and Bangladesh focused on the “human interest and protest frame,”¹ while Chinese media focused on security and conflict of the Rohingya with Myanmar government officials being cited most in their reports.<ref name="egrove.olemiss.edu">Islam, Md Khadimul, "How Newspapers In China, India And Bangladesh Framed The Rohingya Crisis Of 2017" (2018). Electronic Theses and Dissertations. 648.
https://egrove.olemiss.edu/etd/648</ref>{{unreliable source inline|date=October 2020}}

According to Islam's study, the human interest frame was the most frequent frame as it had 28% of news reports.  This indicates that the stories put a human face on the problem the most, and described the Myanmar army’s brutal action prominently. The second most frequent frame is protest with 22.2%, focusing primarily on protest and criticism of the Myanmar government for its actions against Rohingyas. Focusing on different aspects of aid including calling for aid and providing shelter, roughly 21.5% news reports used the aid frame. “The frequency of use of security frame in articles is 11.6% and conflict is 7.5%. Only 2% news reports used other frame that did not fall the six categories of frames developed in this study."<ref name="egrove.olemiss.edu"/>{{unreliable source inline|date=October 2020}}

==== Bangladesh ====
In Bangladeshi reports, the most cited sources were aid agencies for the Rohingya with 19.6% of the sample of news media. Second, were national officials with 17.8% of the media sample, and Myanmar was cited the least at 5.9%.¹ Also found in Islam’s study were Bangladeshi news reports that found, Rohingya appeared 10.4%, foreign officials appeared 16.3%, local admin appeared 14.1%, national elite appeared 14.8%, and other appeared 8.3%.<ref name="egrove.olemiss.edu"/>{{unreliable source inline|date=October 2020}}

==== India ====
From Md Khadimul Islam’s study, Indian media cited national officials the most on the Rohingya issue at 34.7%. Next, aid agencies were cited at 20.8%, and Myanmar appeared 6.9%. Islam also notes that “Rohingya” appeared 8.3%, foreign officials appeared 8.3%, local admin appeared 1.4%, national elite appeared 11.1%, and other appeared 8.3%.<ref name="egrove.olemiss.edu"/>{{unreliable source inline|date=October 2020}}

In 2017, the vast majority of Rohingya people were displaced and became refugees as a result of the genocide. At the peak of the crisis in 2017, over a million Rohingya were forced to flee to other countries.

== Criticism ==
The ongoing genocide against the Rohingya people garnered strong criticism internationally and generated serious concern about the human rights issues. International communities and human rights officials have described the violence as [[ethnic cleansing]] and [[genocide]]. Soon after the security forces and Buddhist militia started "clearance operations", the world leaders warned the Myanmar authority to avoid civilian casualties.<ref name="Guardian-Sep01" /> In late September, a seven-member panel of the [[Permanent Peoples' Tribunal]] accused Myanmar of conducting [[genocide]] against the Rohingya and the Kachin minority groups.<ref name="PPT-Straits-Times2"/><ref name="PPT-Daily-Star2"/> The verdict came after a five-day trial, held at the law faculty of the University of Malaya, which examined various documentaries, expert views, and the testimony of victims. The tribunal made 17 recommendations including demilitarisation of Rakhine State and the end of discriminatory citizenship law.<ref name="PPT-Straits-Times2" /><ref name="PPT-Daily-Star2" /> The United Nations' human rights chief [[Prince Zeid bin Ra'ad|Zeid bin Ra'ad]] described the persecution as "a textbook example of ethnic cleansing". On 5 December 2017, Ra'ad announced that the Rohingya persecution may constitute [[genocide]] under international human rights laws.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theglobepost.com/2018/03/12/myanmar-rohingya-genocide/|title=Yanghee Lee: Rohingya Crimes in Myanmar Bear Hallmarks of Genocide|date=12 March 2018|work=The Globe Post|access-date=8 July 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180708221426/https://www.theglobepost.com/2018/03/12/myanmar-rohingya-genocide/|archive-date=8 July 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> In November, British prime minister [[Theresa May]] and [[United States Secretary of State]] [[Rex Tillerson]] described the situation as "ethnic cleansing"<ref name="Independent-Downing-Street2">{{cite news|author=Joe Watts, Caroline Mortimer|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/downing-street-burma-rohingya-muslims-theresa-may-ethnic-cleansing-military-forces-a8052031.html|title=Downing Street says Burma's treatment of Rohingya Muslims looks like 'ethnic cleansing'|date=13 November 2017|newspaper=The Independent|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180220033211/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/downing-street-burma-rohingya-muslims-theresa-may-ethnic-cleansing-military-forces-a8052031.html|archive-date=20 February 2018}}</ref><ref name="USSD-Tillerson2">{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/secretary/remarks/2017/11/275848.htm|title=Efforts To Address Burma's Rakhine State Crisis|author=Rex W.

After a two-year investigation into the Rohingya ethnic minority, the human rights group [[Amnesty International]] described the restricted situation of the Rohingya people as "an open-air prison" as they are under a "vicious system of institutionalized [[discrimination]] and [[Racial segregation|segregation]]" which is limiting their [[human rights]], their [[freedom of movement]], and their access to [[food]], [[healthcare]], and [[education]] in their report.<ref name="Amnesty-Apartheid">{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2017/11/myanmar-apartheid-in-rakhine-state/|title='Caged Without A Roof': Apartheid in Myanmar's Rakhine State|publisher=Amnesty International|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180115064231/https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2017/11/myanmar-apartheid-in-rakhine-state/|archive-date=15 January 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="Huffpost-Apartheid">{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/rohingya-muslims-prison-amnesty_us_5a05f62ce4b01d21c83e6b84|title=Apartheid in Myanmar: Rohingya Muslims Trapped In 'Open-Air Prison,' Amnesty Says|author=Jesselyn Cook|date=11 November 2017|work=HuffPost|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180201112841/https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/rohingya-muslims-prison-amnesty_us_5a05f62ce4b01d21c83e6b84|archive-date=1 February 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> Amnesty International mentions that the Rohingya minority are confined to their villages, townships, and poorly-maintained camps which are cut off from the rest of Myanmar, and travel between their own villages is severely restricted.

According to [[Binoda Mishra]], who heads the Centre for Studies in International Relations and Development in India:<ref name="why_do_china_2017_10_18_scmp_com" /><blockquote>"China supports Myanmar to retain its influence built over three decades of massive development aid and supply of military hardware, India supports Myanmar to play catch-up and build influence partly by development financing and partly by playing on civilisational linkages based on the shared Buddhist heritage. And both India and China engage the Burmese military as much as the civilian government because the country is key to India’s ‘[[Look East policy (India)|Act East']] policy and China’s [[Belt and Road Initiative]].”</blockquote>China is Myanmar's northern neighbour and ally.<ref name="Nations"/> China has been investing in the [[Kyaukpyu]] port which could provide a port for [[Sino-Myanmar pipelines]], from the Bay of Bengal to [[Yunnan]].<ref name="why_do_china_2017_10_18_scmp_com" /> As part of its "[[One Belt, One Road]]" program, China invested heavily in Rakhine State—including the development of China's strategically and economically critical first-ever seaport on the [[Indian Ocean]], in the predominantly-Rohingya coastal Rakhine township of [[Maungdaw township (Myanmar)|Maungdaw]]—providing a shorter route to the sea for landlocked Central and Western China.<ref name="why_do_china_2017_10_18_scmp_com" />

China displayed intentions to develop Rakhine State commercially in other ways. With China's engagement in Rakhine state requiring cooperation with the Burmese military and government, China used its veto power in the [[United Nations Security Council|U.N. Security Council]] to protect Myanmar from any forceful U.N. action over the Rohingya issue—and has argued that the solution to the Rohingya crisis is more development in Rakhine State.<ref name="business_interests_2017_01_04_theguardian_com">[https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2017/jan/04/is-rohingya-persecution-caused-by-business-interests-rather-than-religion "Is Rohingya persecution caused by business interests rather than religion?,"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180905175759/https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2017/jan/04/is-rohingya-persecution-caused-by-business-interests-rather-than-religion|date=5 September 2018}} ''[[The Guardian (newspaper)|The Guardian]],'' retrieved 20 October 2017</ref><ref name="why_do_china_2017_10_18_scmp_com">[http://www.scmp.com/week-asia/geopolitics/article/2115839/why-do-china-india-back-myanmar-over-rohingya-crisis "Why do China, India back Myanmar over the Rohingya crisis?,"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180905175732/https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/geopolitics/article/2115839/why-do-china-india-back-myanmar-over-rohingya-crisis|date=5 September 2018}} ''[[South China Morning Post]],'' retrieved 20 October 2017</ref><ref name="chinese_spadework_2017_11_28_the_hindu">[http://www.thehindu.com/news/international/chinese-ministers-spadework-lays-the-foundation-for-suu-kyis-visit/article21040847.ece "Chinese Minister's spadework lays the foundation for Suu Kyi's visit,"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181109194813/https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/chinese-ministers-spadework-lays-the-foundation-for-suu-kyis-visit/article21040847.ece |date=9 November 2018 }} 28 November 2017 ''[[The Hindu (newspaper)|The Hindu]],'' (India).

=== India ===

Like China, India supported Myanmar over the crisis,<ref name="why_do_china_2017_10_18_scmp_com" /> though more discreetly.<ref name=":0" /> South China Morning Post reported that India invested in the Rakhine's [[Kaladan Multi-Modal Transit Transport Project|Kaladan project]] to connect Northeast India to the Bay of Bengal.<ref name="why_do_china_2017_10_18_scmp_com" /> Due to the influx of over half a million refugees, both Bangladesh and India feared a "[[Jihadism|jihadi]] nexus".<ref name="why_do_china_2017_10_18_scmp_com" /> The [[Ministry of External Affairs (India)|Indian Ministry of External Affairs]] stated:<blockquote>"We stand by Myanmar in the hour of its crisis, we strongly condemn the [[Terrorism|terrorist]] attack on 24–25 August and condole the death of policemen and soldiers, we will back Myanmar in its fight against terrorism".<ref name="why_do_china_2017_10_18_scmp_com" /></blockquote> This occurred a day after an [[Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army]] (ARSA) attack on 30 police and armed guards. Myanmar claims this attack "triggered its ruthless counter-attack that has driven more than half a million Rohingya into Bangladesh."<ref name="why_do_china_2017_10_18_scmp_com" /> Major General Gaganjit Singh, former deputy chief of [[India’s Defence Intelligence Agency]], asked:<blockquote>"What if ARSA terrorists attack an Indian ship on the Kaladan river or try blowing up parts of the Yunnan-Kyauk Phyu oil-gas pipeline as the [separatist group United Liberation Front of Assam] used to do in [the Indian state of] Assam? Such scenarios cannot be discounted".<ref name="why_do_china_2017_10_18_scmp_com" /></blockquote>

== Reactions from supranational bodies ==

=== United Nations ===

==== Findings of the OHCHR Independent Fact-Finding Mission 2018 ====
On 12 September 2018, the OHCHR Independent Fact-Finding Mission on Myanmar published its report to the United Nations Human Rights Council.<ref name="fact-finding">{{Cite web|url=https://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/HRC/MyanmarFFM/Pages/ReportoftheMyanmarFFM.aspx|title=Report of Independent International Fact-Finding Mission on Myanmar (27 August 2018)|website=ohchr.org|access-date=14 August 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181019232309/https://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/HRC/MyanmarFFM/Pages/ReportoftheMyanmarFFM.aspx|archive-date=19 October 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> Following 875 interviews with victims and eyewitnesses since 2011, it concluded that "the [Burmese] military has consistently failed to respect [[international human rights law]]<ref name="fact-finding" /> and the international humanitarian law principles of distinction, proportionality and precaution." Even before the most recent incident of mass Rohingya displacement began in 2011, the report found that the restrictions on travel, birth registration, and education resulting from Rohingya [[statelessness]] violated Rohingya human rights. During the mass displacement of almost 725,000 Rohingya by August 2018 to neighbouring Bangladesh, as a result of persecution by the Tatmadaw, the report recorded "gross human rights violations and abuses" such as mass rape, murder, torture, and imprisonment. It also accused the Tatmadaw of crimes against humanity, genocide, and ethnic cleansing.

==== Criticism of the Response of UN Agencies ====
[[File:Rohingya_displaced_Muslims_010.jpg|thumb|Rohingyas at the [[Kutupalong refugee camp]] in Bangladesh, October 2017]]
All NGOs and humanitarian agencies, including UN agencies, are bound by the humanitarian principles of humanity, impartiality, neutrality, and independence.<ref>IFRC and ICRC, ''Code of Conduct for the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement and Non-Governmental Organizations in Disaster Relief'' (1994) (Retrieved 8 December 2018).</ref> As the 2018 Independent Fact-Finding Mission Report highlighted, UN agencies were aware of Rohingya persecution for almost three decades, with five consecutive Special Rapporteurs on the situation of human rights in Myanmar having been appointed since 1992.<ref name="Sara Perria 2017">Sara Perria, "The Unmaking of Myanmar" (21 September 2017) ''OpenCanada.Org'' (Retrieved 8 December 2018).</ref> However, the Independent Fact-Finding Mission Report noted: "While Myanmar was repeatedly identified as a crisis situation requiring a human rights-driven response by the "whole of the United Nations", this approach was rarely, if ever, taken. Rather, many United Nations agencies have continued to prioritise development goals, humanitarian access, and quiet diplomacy. That approach has demonstrably failed, and the United Nations as a whole has failed adequately to address human rights concerns in Myanmar. Even now, the approach taken displays few signs of any lessons learned, with human rights missing from agreements recently signed with the Government."

The UN's continued attempts to cooperate with the Myanmar Government, despite the Government's unwillingness to acknowledge or address the [[Tatmadaw]]'s persecution of the Rohingya,<ref>Adam Withnall, "Rohingya crisis: Myanmar rejects UN report on genocide after denying investigators access to sites"(29 August 2018) ''The Independent'' (Retrieved 8 December 2018).</ref> has allowed the humanitarian crisis to worsen. Although this approach complies with the common interpretation of other humanitarian principles, such as neutrality and impartiality, it neglects the core humanitarian principle of humanity. For example, a suppressed internal UN report<ref name="Sara Perria 2017" /> heavily criticised the UN Country Team for ineffectively focusing on development and investment rather than on addressing the root causes of the persecution. Moreover, a September 2017 BBC investigation reported that, in an attempt to promote investment into Myanmar, UN officials prevented human rights activists travelling to Rohingya areas, tried to shut down public advocacy on the subject, and isolated staff that warned of ethnic cleansing.<ref>Jonah Fisher, "UN failures on Rohingya revealed" (28 September 2017) BBC News (Retrieved 8 December 2018).</ref> Despite these criticisms of the UN's approach, in June 2018 the UNDP and UNHCR entered an MoU<!-- Abbreviation not defined --> with Myanmar Government providing for the reparation of Rohingya to Myanmar.<ref>Caroline Gluck, "UN agencies and Myanmar ink agreement, setting the stage for Rohingya return" (6 June 2018) ''UN News'' (Retrieved 8 December 2018).</ref> On 13 November 2018, the plan to repatriate an initial 2,200 Rohingya was abandoned due to protests by Rohingya refugees.<ref>Susannah Savage, "Rohingya refugees say they would 'rather die' than be sent back to Burma, as repatriation plans are 'stalled until 2019'" (18 November 2018) ''The Telegraph'' (Retrieved 8 December 2018).</ref>

==== Recommendations ====
In December 2017, a coalition of 69 human rights non-governmental organisations appointed an Independent Fact-Finding Mission team, including Amnesty International and the Human Rights Watch, and called upon the UN Security Council to take "immediate action" in response to the humanitarian crisis by exploring "all avenues for justice and accountability, including through international courts". The coalition also called for arms embargoes and targeted sanctions.<ref>Burma Campaign UK, ''Joint Appeal to the UN Security Council to Act on Myanmar's Rohingya Crisis'' (11 December 2017) (Retrieved 8 December 2018).</ref>

The distinct OHCHR-appointed Independent Fact-Finding Mission 2018 Report similarly recommended that the UN Security Council issue a Chapter VII referral to the International Criminal Court, or, in the alternative, establishes an ad hoc international criminal tribunal. They also recommended: "enhanced monitoring, documentation, analysis and public reporting on the situation of human rights", the allocation of appropriate resources, repatriation "only when safe, voluntary and dignified with explicit human rights protections in place", termination of operational support for Tatmadaw until the genuine commitment to reform and cooperation is secured, and the establishment of a trust fund for victims.

Most recently<!-- When? -->, the Washington-based Public International Law & Policy Group concluded in their December 2018 report, based on more than 1,000 interviews with Rohingya refugees, that there are "reasonable grounds" to believe that crimes against humanity, war crimes, and genocide have been committed by the Tatmadaw against the Rohingya population. In turn, they recommended "that a criminal tribunal should be established or granted jurisdiction to further investigate international crimes committed in Rakhine State and prosecute those responsible" and "the urgent establishment of an accountability mechanism or an immediate referral of the situation to the ICC."<ref>Public International Law & Policy Group, ''Documenting Atrocity Crimes Committed Against the Rohingya in Myanmar's Rakhine State'' (2 December 2018) (Retrieved 8 December 2018).</ref>

=== ASEAN ===
Being a primarily [[intergovernmental organization|intergovernmental]] rather than a [[Supranational union|supranational]] organization like the [[European Union]], [[ASEAN]] strongly upholds the principle in [[international law]] of [[Westphalian sovereignty|noninterference]] in the domestic affairs of other states, including and especially those of its own members, Myanmar being one of them. A day before the 30th [[ASEAN Summit]] was held on 26 April 2017, Reuters reported on the Myanmar military operations on the Rohingya in November 2016. Nonetheless, the Rohingya crisis was not on the official agenda in the Summit.<ref name="thediplomat.com">{{Cite web|url=https://thediplomat.com/2017/05/why-asean-cant-ignore-the-rohingya-crisis/|title=Why ASEAN Can't Ignore the Rohingya Crisis|last=Diplomat|first=Jera Lego , The|website=The Diplomat|access-date=13 August 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170612111150/http://thediplomat.com/2017/05/why-asean-cant-ignore-the-rohingya-crisis/|archive-date=12 June 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

However, leaders of ASEAN countries began to raise concerns on the issue. In a meeting with other ASEAN foreign ministers on 19 December 2016, Malaysian Foreign Minister Anifah Aman called for a collective effort to resolve the crisis. In addition, in the 30th ASEAN Summit, Indonesian President Joko Widodo discussed the issue of the Rohingya crisis with Suu Kyi. He stressed the importance of stability in Myanmar for the wider regional security.<ref name="thediplomat.com" />

The ASEAN states' hesitance to comment on the issue may be explained by a concern that the rise of China and its influence in Myanmar could risk ASEAN's interest in the country. Azeem Ibrahim, the author of ''The Rohingyas: Inside Myanmar's Hidden Genocide'', noted "Myanmar's interactions with ASEAN are perhaps indicative of its wider approach to international relations."<ref>Ibrahim, Azeem. "The Return to Democracy (2008–2015)." ''The Rohingyas: Inside Myanmar's Hidden Genocide.'' London, England: Hurst, 2016. 75. Print.</ref> While ASEAN member states welcome economic opportunities with China's rise, they fear its growing influence. It has been suggested that ASEAN criticism of Myanmar's domestic crisis will lead to closer ties between [[China–Myanmar relations|China and Myanmar]].<ref>Chachavalpongpun, P. 2012. 'The Vexing Strategic Tug-of-War over Naypyidaw: ASEAN's View of the Sino-Burmese Ties.' ''Journal of Current Southeast Asian Affairs,'' 31:1 97–114.</ref>

As of 7 June 2019, ASEAN released a report stating optimism that half a million Rohingyas (referred to as "Muslim") will return to Myanmar in two years. The report allegedly glossed over the atrocities committed by Suu Kyi's regime. The UN has not yet commented.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/outcry-as-asean-predicts-smooth-rohingya-return-to-myanmar-11606340|title=Outcry as ASEAN predicts 'smooth' Rohingya return to Myanmar|date=7 June 2019|access-date=9 June 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190608212852/https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/outcry-as-asean-predicts-smooth-rohingya-return-to-myanmar-11606340|archive-date=8 June 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>
