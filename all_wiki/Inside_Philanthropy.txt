The site provides news on major philanthropy and its trends, and presents profiles of big donors in particular categories such as donors from the technology industry, donors from the financial industry, and supporters of  major education and healthcare initiatives.<ref name="MyUser_Forbes_August_30_2015c"/> It also rates foundation program officers by their performance, rather than by the nonprofits they fund.<ref name="MyUser_Forbes_August_30_2015c">{{cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomwatson/2014/07/20/challenging-the-big-funders-philanthropy-startup-targets-billionaires-and-their-giving/ |title=Challenging The Big Funders: Philanthropy Startup Targets Billionaires And Their Giving |newspaper=Forbes |date=  |author= |accessdate= August 30, 2015}}</ref> It issues its own set of awards, such as the Philanthropist of the Year award and the Boldest Philanthropic Vision award.<ref name="MyUser_Billionaire.com_August_30_2015c">{{cite web |url=http://www.billionaire.com/philanthropy/conscious-entrepreneurs/1289/candid-philanthropy-awards-spotlight-generous-billionaires |title=The Most Generous Billionaires â€” Inside Philanthropy 2014 Awards - Billionaire |newspaper=Billionaire.com |date=  |author= |accessdate= August 30, 2015}}</ref>

The site has been noted for naming wealthy people who ''Inside Philanthropy'' considers as scoring relatively poorly on "relative generosity", or percentage of wealth that a person has given away, even if they still give out a comparatively large amount of money in absolute terms.<ref name="MyUser_Blog.sfgate.com_August_30_2015c">{{cite web |url=http://blog.sfgate.com/techchron/2014/03/21/are-larry-page-jerry-yang-and-larry-ellison-pulling-their-philanthropic-weight/ |title=Are Larry Page, Jerry Yang, and Larry Ellison pulling their philanthropic weight? - The Technology Chronicles |newspaper=Blog.sfgate.com |date=  |author= |accessdate= August 30, 2015}}</ref>
