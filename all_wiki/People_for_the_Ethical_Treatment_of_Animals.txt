'''People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals''' ('''PETA'''; {{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|iː|t|ə}}) is an American [[animal rights]] [[organization]] based in [[Norfolk, Virginia]], and led by [[Ingrid Newkirk]], its international president. The nonprofit corporation claims 6.5 million supporters. Its slogan is "Animals are not ours to experiment on, eat, wear, use for entertainment, or abuse in any other way."<ref name="about" />

Founded in March 1980 by [[Ingrid Newkirk]] and fellow animal rights activist [[Alex Pacheco (activist)|Alex Pacheco]], the organization first caught the public's attention in the summer of 1981 during what became known as the [[Silver Spring monkeys]] case, a widely publicized dispute about experiments conducted on 17 [[macaque]] monkeys inside the Institute of Behavioral Research in [[Silver Spring, Maryland]]. The case lasted 10 years, involved the only [[police raid]] on an animal laboratory in the [[United States]], triggered an amendment in 1985 to the [[Animal Welfare Act of 1966#Amendments|U.S. Animal Welfare Act]], and established PETA as an internationally known organization.<ref name=SilverSpring>Schwartz, Jeffrey M. and Begley, Sharon.

''In Defense of Animals'', Basil Blackwell 1985, pp. 135–147.</ref> Today, it focuses on four core issues—opposition to [[factory farming]], [[fur farming]], [[animal testing]], and the use of animals in entertainment. It also campaigns for a vegan lifestyle and against eating meat, fishing, the killing of animals regarded as pests, the keeping of chained backyard dogs, [[cock fighting]], [[dog fighting]], [[beekeeping]], and [[bullfighting]].<ref name="about" />

[[Ingrid Newkirk]] was born in [[England]] in 1949, and raised in [[Hertfordshire]] and later [[New Delhi]], [[India]], where her father—a navigational engineer—was stationed. Newkirk, now an atheist, was educated in a convent, the only British girl there.<ref name=Specter>{{Cite web|last=Specter|first=Michael|author-link=Michael Specter|url=http://www.michaelspecter.com/2003/04/the-extremist/|title=The Extremist: The woman behind the most successful radical group in America|publisher=[[The New Yorker]]|date=April 4, 2003|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200309221947/http://www.michaelspecter.com/2003/04/the-extremist/|archive-date=March 9, 2020}}</ref> She moved to the [[United States]] as a teenager, first studying to become a stockbroker, but after taking some abandoned kittens to an animal shelter in 1969 and being appalled by the conditions that she found there, she chose a career in animal protection instead.<ref>Phelps, Norm.

By 1976 she was head of the animal disease control division of D.C.'s Commission on Public Health and in 1980 was among those named as "Washingtonians of the Year."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonian.com/2008/01/29/past-washingtonians-of-the-year/|title=Past Washingtonians of the Year &#124; Washingtonian (DC)|date=January 29, 2008|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160421052126/https://www.washingtonian.com/2008/01/29/past-washingtonians-of-the-year/|archive-date=April 21, 2016|publisher=[[Washingtonian (magazine)|Washingtonian]]}}</ref>

In 1980, after her divorce, she met Alex Pacheco, a political science major at [[George Washington University]].<ref name=Rosenberg/> He volunteered at the shelter where she worked, and they fell in love and began living together.<ref name=Guillermo18>Guillermo, Kathy Snow. ''Monkey Business''. National Press Books, 1993, p. 18.</ref> Newkirk read [[Peter Singer]]'s influential book, [[Animal Liberation (book)|''Animal Liberation'']] (1975), and in March 1980, she persuaded Pacheco to join her in forming People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, at that point just "five people in a basement," as Newkirk described it. They were mostly students and members of the local vegetarian society, but the group included a friend of Pacheco's from the U.K., Kim Stallwood, a British activist who went on to become the national organizer of the [[British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection]].<ref>* For the "five people in a basement" quote, see Schwartz, Jeffrey and Begley, Sharon.

===Silver Spring monkeys===

''What Animals Want: Expertise and Advocacy in Laboratory Animal Welfare Policy''. Oxford University Press, p. 149, see figure 4.2.</ref>]]
The group first came to public attention in 1981 during the [[Silver Spring monkeys]] case, a dispute about experiments conducted by researcher Edward Taub on 17 [[Macaque|macaque monkeys]] inside the Institute of Behavioral Research in Silver Spring, Maryland. The case led to the first police raid in the United States on an animal laboratory, triggered an amendment in 1985 to the United States Animal Welfare Act, and became the first animal-testing case to be appealed to the United States Supreme Court,<ref name="SilverSpring"/> which upheld a Louisiana State Court ruling that denied PETA's request for custody of the monkeys.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p2p0MptGeBkC&q=Silver%20Spring%20Monkeys%20Supreme%20Court&pg=PA55|title=Animals and the Law: A Sourcebook|first=Jordan|last=Curnutt|pages=55–57|access-date=August 12, 2010|year=2001|publisher=ABC-CLIO|location=Santa Barbara, California|isbn=1-57607-147-2}}</ref>

Pacheco had taken a job in May 1981 inside a primate research laboratory at the Institute, intending to gain firsthand experience of working inside an animal laboratory.<ref>Pacheco, Alex. [http://www.petatv.com/tvpopup/video.asp?video=silver-spring-monkeys&Player=wm "Testimony on the Silver Spring monkeys case], U.S. House Subcommittee on Science, Research, and Technology, PETA, accessed June 26, 2010.{{Dead link|date=October 2020}}</ref> Taub had been cutting [[Dorsal root ganglion|sensory ganglia]] that supplied nerves to the monkeys' fingers, hands, arms, and legs—a process called "deafferentation"—so that the monkeys could not feel them; some of the monkeys had had their entire spinal columns deafferented. He then used restraint, electric shock, and withholding of food and water to force the monkeys to use the deafferented parts of their bodies. The research led in part to the discovery of [[neuroplasticity]] and a new therapy for stroke victims called [[constraint-induced movement therapy]].<ref>Doidge, Norman. ''The Brain That Changes Itself''. Viking Penguin, 2007, p. 141.

Pacheco went to the laboratory at night, taking photographs that showed the monkeys living in what the Institute for Laboratory Animal Research's ''ILAR Journal'' called "filthy conditions."<ref>Sideris, Lisa et al.{{cite web|url=http://dels.nas.edu/ilar_n/ilarjournal/40_1/40_1Roots.shtml |title=Roots of Concern with Nonhuman Animals in Biomedical Ethics |access-date=2008-06-03 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060901080534/http://dels.nas.edu/ilar_n/ilarjournal/40_1/40_1Roots.shtml |archive-date=2006-09-01 }}, Institute for Laboratory Animal Research, ILAR Journal V40(1), 1999.</ref> He passed his photographs to the police, who raided the lab and arrested Taub.

These and the Silver Spring monkey case jointly put animal rights on the agenda in the United States.<ref>Phelps, Norm.

The 10-year battle for custody of the monkeys—described by ''The Washington Post'' as a vicious mud fight, during which both sides accused the other of lies and distortion—&nbsp;transformed PETA into a national, then international, movement. By February 1991, it claimed over 350,000 supporters, a paid staff of over 100, and an annual budget of over $7 million.<ref>Carlson, Peter.

===Campaigns and consumer boycotts===
[[File:PETA Lettuce Ladies.JPG|thumb|left|upright=0.7|PETA's trademark "Lettuce ladies" in Columbus, Ohio]]
The organization is known for its aggressive media campaigns, combined with a solid base of celebrity support—in addition to its honorary directors, [[Paul McCartney]], [[Alicia Silverstone]], [[Eva Mendes]], [[Charlize Theron]], [[Ellen DeGeneres]], and many other notable celebrities have appeared in PETA ads.<ref>[http://www.chicagotribune.com/lifestyles/sns-green-peta-famous-faces-photogallery.html "Pictures: PETA's Famous Faces,"] ''Chicago Tribune'', accessed 22 June 2015.</ref> Every week, Newkirk holds what ''The New Yorker'' calls a "war council," with two dozen of her top strategists gathered at a square table in the PETA conference room, with no suggestion considered too outrageous.<ref name=Specter/> PETA also gives an annual prize, called the Proggy Award (for "progress"), to individuals or organizations dedicated to animal welfare or who distinguish themselves through their efforts within the area of animal welfare.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/lifestyle/03/04/09/7-companies-win-petas-proggy-awards|title=7 companies win PETA's 'Proggy Awards'|last=Servando|first=Kristine|date=March 4, 2009|access-date=August 5, 2010|publisher=ABS-CBNnews.com}}</ref>

Many of the campaigns have focused on large corporations. Fast food companies such as KFC, Wendy's, and Burger King have been targeted. In the animal-testing industry, PETA's consumer boycotts have focused on Avon, Benetton, Bristol-Myers-Squibb, Chesebrough-Pond's, Dow Chemical, General Motors, and others. The group's ''modus operandi'' includes buying shares in target companies such as McDonald's and Kraft Foods in order to exert influence.<ref>For example, as shareholders of YUM! Brands, which owns KFC, PETA submitted a shareholders' resolution asking for more humane treatment of the animals KFC processes.

As part of its anti-fur action, PETA supporters have infiltrated hundreds of fashion shows in the U.S. and Europe and one in China, throwing red paint on the catwalks and unfurling banners.

PETA has also objected to the practice of [[mulesing]] (removing strips of wool-bearing skin from around the buttocks of a sheep). In October 2004, PETA launched a boycott against the Australian wool industry, leading some clothing retailers to ban products using Australian wool from their stores.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.smh.com.au/breaking-news-national/uk-retailer-bans-aussie-mulesing-wool-20100621-yrn9.html|title=UK retailer bans Aussie mulesing wool|date= June 21, 2010|access-date=21 June 2010|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|first=Petrina|last=Berry}}</ref> In response, the Australian wool industry sued PETA, arguing among other things that mulesing prevents [[Myiasis|flystrike]], a very painful disease that can affect sheep.

Some campaigns have been particularly controversial. Newkirk was criticized in 2003 for sending a letter to PLO leader [[Yasser Arafat]] asking him to keep animals out of the conflict, after a donkey was [[Animal-borne bomb attacks|blown up]] during an attack in Jerusalem. The group's 2003 "Holocaust on your Plate" exhibition—eight {{convert|60|sqft|m2|adj=on}} panels juxtaposing images of [[Holocaust]] victims with animal carcasses and animals being transported to slaughter—was criticized by the [[Anti-Defamation League]], which said, "the effort by Peta to compare the deliberate systematic murder of millions of Jews to the issue of animal rights is abhorrent" and "[r]ather than deepen our revulsion against what the Nazis did to the Jews, the project will undermine the struggle to understand the Holocaust and to find a way to make sure such catastrophes never happen again." In July 2010, the German Federal Constitutional Court ruled that PETA's campaign was not protected by free speech laws and banned it within Germany as an offense against human dignity.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.haaretz.com/jewish-world/2.209/germany-rules-animal-rights-group-s-holocaust-ad-offensive-1.272963|title=Germany rules animal rights group's Holocaust ad offensive|agency=Associated Press|newspaper=Ha'aretz|date=July 8, 2010|access-date=August 20, 2010}}</ref> The exhibit, however, had been funded by an anonymous Jewish philanthropist<ref name="Teather">Teather, David.

In August 2011, it was announced that PETA will be launching a [[soft pornography]] website in the [[.xxx]] domain. PETA spokesperson Lindsay Rajt told the ''Huffington Post'', "We try to use absolutely every outlet to stick up for animals," adding that "We are careful about what we do and wouldn't use nudity or some of our flashier tactics if we didn't know they worked." PETA also used nudity in its "Veggie Love" ad which it prepared for the [[Super Bowl]], only to have it banned by the network. PETA's work has drawn the ire of some feminists who argue that the organization sacrifices women's rights to press its agenda. Lindsay Beyerstein criticized PETA saying "They're the ones drawing disturbing analogies between pornography, misogyny and animal cruelty."<ref>{{cite news|last=White|first=Madeline|title=PETA to launch porn website: Is this still about animal rights?|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/the-hot-button/peta-to-launch-porn-website-is-this-still-about-animal-rights/article2139025/|access-date=August 23, 2011|newspaper=Globe and Mail|date=August 23, 2011|location=Toronto}}</ref>

* In 1984, PETA produced a 26-minute film, ''[[Unnecessary Fuss]]'', based on 60 hours of research video footage stolen by the [[Animal Liberation Front]] during a break-in at the University of Pennsylvania's head injury clinic. The footage showed experiments on the baboons with a hydraulic device intended to simulate whiplash. The publicity led to investigations, suspension of grant funding, the firing of a veterinarian, the closure of the research lab, and a period of probation for the university.

* Between 2012 and 2014, PETA investigated [[sheep shearing]] sheds in the [[wool]] industry in [[Australia]] and the US. PETA sent reports and film footage to local authorities alleging that shearers had kicked and beat sheep, stomped on their heads, necks and legs, punched them with clippers, slammed them onto the floor, and sewed up cuts without pain relief. An American Wool Council spokesperson said "We do not condone or support the actions of anyone that results in the abuse of sheep either intentionally or unintentionally.

* In 2014, PETA conducted an undercover investigation of the horse-racing industry, filming seven hours of footage that, as ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported, "showed mistreatment of the horses to be widespread and cavalier." Noted trainer [[Steve Asmussen]] and his top assistant trainer, Scott Blasi, were accused "of subjecting their horses to cruel and injurious treatments, administering drugs to them for nontherapeutic purposes, and having one of their jockeys use an electrical device to shock horses into running faster."

By contrast, the Kentucky Horse Racing Commission, which also received PETA's allegations, found that Asmussen did not violate any of its rules.

* In 2015, as ''[[The Washington Post]]'' reported, PETA investigated Sweet Stem Farm, a pig farm that supplies meat to [[Whole Foods]]. The resulting video footage "featured images of pigs, some allegedly sick and not given appropriate care, crowded into hot pens and roughly handled by employees," contradicting both the farm's own video self-portrait and Whole Foods' claims about "humane meat" (a term that PETA maintains is an oxymoron).

The group's video showed "an octopus writhing as its limbs are severed by a chef at T Equals Fish, a Koreatown sushi restaurant in Los Angeles." PETA noted that octopuses "are considered among the most intelligent invertebrates" and "are capable of feeling pain just as a pig or rabbit would."<ref>CBS News.

The ''[[Houston Press]]'' noted that "Texas A&M has been less than transparent about the research, and in some cases has denied that the dogs experience pain or discomfort." Among other efforts, PETA placed a billboard to oppose the ineffectual research on animals.<ref>Malisow, Craig.

* Bio Corporation, a company that supplies dead animals for study and dissection, was the subject of a November 2017 PETA undercover investigation. It was claimed that video footage showed workers at the company's facility in [[Alexandria, Minnesota]] "drowning fully-conscious pigeons, injecting live crayfish with latex and claiming that they sometimes would freeze turtles to death." PETA brought 25 charges of cruelty to animals against the company. Drowning is not considered an acceptable form of euthanasia, according to the [[American Veterinary Medical Association]], and its standards of humane euthanasia must be followed by companies certified by the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] such as Bio Corporation.<ref>Hugo, Kristin.

===Ag-gag laws===

Various U.S. states have passed [[ag-gag]] laws in order to prevent animal rights and animal welfare groups from conducting undercover investigations of operations that use animals.

===Euthanasia and PETA's shelter===

PETA is a strong proponent of euthanasia and considers it a necessary evil in a world full of unwanted pets. They oppose the [[no-kill movement]], and rather than adoption programs, PETA prefers to aim for zero births through [[Neutering|spaying and neutering]].<ref name=Interlandi>{{cite web|url=http://www.newsweek.com/2008/04/27/peta-and-euthanasia.html|title=PETA and Euthanasia|first=Jeneen|last=Interlandi|date=April 27, 2008|website=[[Newsweek]]|access-date=July 31, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160330121445/http://www.newsweek.com/2008/04/27/peta-and-euthanasia.html|archive-date=March 30, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> They recommend not breeding [[pit bull]]s, and support euthanasia in certain situations for animals in shelters, such as those being housed for long periods in cramped cages.<ref>Newkirk, Ingrid.

PETA calls their shelter in Norfolk, Virginia a "shelter of last resort", claiming they only receive old, sick, injured, badly behaved, and otherwise unadoptable animals. Operating as open admission, they take in animals no one else will, and consider death a merciful end. The consistently high percentage of animals euthanized at PETA's shelter has been controversial.<ref name=hp.shelter/><ref name=wp.shelter/> In 2014, PETA euthanized over 80% of the shelter's animals and justified its euthanasia policies as mercy killings.<ref name=wp.euth>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/religion/at-petas-shelter-most-animals-are-put-down-peta-calls-them-mercy-killings/2015/03/12/e84e9af2-c8fa-11e4-bea5-b893e7ac3fb3_story.html|title=At PETA's shelter, most animals are put down.

In 2008, industry lobby group [[Center for Consumer Freedom]] (CCF) petitioned the [[Virginia Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services]], requesting they reclassify PETA as a "[[slaughterhouse]]."

PETA's euthanasia practices have drawn intense scrutiny from lawmakers and criticism from animal rights activists for years. Fueled by public outrage from a 2014 incident where PETA workers took a pet Chihuahua from its porch and euthanized it the same day, the [[Virginia General Assembly]] passed Senate Bill 1381 in 2015 aimed at curtailing the operation of PETA's shelter.

===Legal proceedings===
Two PETA employees were acquitted in 2007 of cruelty to animals after at least 80 euthanized animals were left in dumpsters in a shopping center in [[Ahoskie, North Carolina]], over the course of a month in 2005; the two employees were seen leaving behind 18 dead animals, and 13 more were found inside their van. The animals had been euthanized after being removed from shelters in [[Northampton County, North Carolina|Northampton]] and [[Bertie County, North Carolina|Bertie]] counties.

In November 2014, a resident of [[Accomack County, Virginia]], produced video evidence that two workers in a van marked with a PETA logo had entered his property in a [[trailer park]] and taken his dog, who was then euthanized. He reported the incident to the police, who identified and charged two PETA workers, but the charges were later dropped by the [[Commonwealth's attorney|commonwealth attorney]] on the grounds that it was not possible to prove [[Intention (criminal law)|criminal intent]].<ref>Deanna leBlanc (12 November 2014) [http://wavy.com/2014/11/12/man-claims-peta-stole-killed-family-pet/ Man claims PETA stole, killed family pet] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150221231123/http://wavy.com/2014/11/12/man-claims-peta-stole-killed-family-pet/ |date=2015-02-21 }}, retrieved 26 February 2015.</ref> The trailer park's manager had contacted PETA after a group of residents moved out, leaving their dogs behind, which is why the workers were on the property. The state later determined that PETA had violated state law by failing to ensure that the [[Chihuahua (dog)|Chihuahua]], who was not wearing a collar or tag, was properly identified and for failing to keep the dog alive for five days before euthanizing the animal. Citing a "severity of this lapse in judgment," the [[Virginia Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services]] issued PETA a first-ever violation and imposed a $500 fine.

In 2015, PETA sued British nature photographer David Slater in [[United States District Court for the Northern District of California|US court]] as a [[next friend]] for a wild [[Celebes crested macaque|macaque]] monkey, whom they named Naruto. PETA argued that the monkey was entitled to the [[copyright]] of a [[selfie]] photo it had taken while handling Slater's camera, and naming themselves to be the administrator of any copyright revenue. The [[monkey selfie copyright dispute]] was originally dismissed by [[William Orrick III|Judge Orrick]] who wrote there is no indication that the [[Copyright Act of 1976|Copyright Act]] extends to animals and a monkey could not own a copyright.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/01/07/462245189/federal-judge-says-monkey-cant-own-copyright-to-his-selfie|title=Monkey Can't Own Copyright To His Selfie, Federal Judge Says|website=NPR.org|language=en|access-date=2019-01-01}}</ref>  PETA appealed,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnn.com/2017/09/12/asia/monkey-selfie-settlement/index.html|title=PPETA, photographer reach settlement in 'monkey selfie' case|last=Berlinger|first=Joshua|date=2017-09-12|work=CNN|access-date=2019-02-25}}</ref> but the [[Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals|Court of Appeals]] found in favor of Slater saying that "PETA's real motivation in this case was to advance its own interests, not Naruto's."

===Video games===

PETA has created [[PETA satirical browser games|a number of satirical video games]] with such names as 'How Green Is My Diet?' and 'KKK or AKC? Spot the Difference'. PETA uses these games to spread attention about animal rights and animal welfare and to advocate vegetarian and vegan diets.

In her letter, Newkirk called the game "unrealistic" and wrote "you've taken all the cruelty out of milking". She also suggested that "instead of sugarcoating the subject, Nintendo switch to simulating activities in which no animals suffer."<ref>{{cite news |last1=Frank |first1=Allegra |title=PETA takes aim at Nintendo for 1-2-Switch's milking minigame |url=https://www.polygon.com/2017/3/31/15141004/nintendo-switch-1-2-switch-peta-milking-minigame |access-date=March 8, 2019 |agency=Polygon |date=March 31, 2017}}</ref>

===Person of the year===
Each year, PETA selects a "Person of the Year" who has helped advance the cause of animal rights. In 2015, [[Pope Francis]] was selected for his encouragement to treat animals with kindness and to respect the environment.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://time.com/4130961/peta-pope-francis/|title=Pope Francis is PETA's Person of the Year|website=Time|first=Daniel|last=White|date=December 1, 2015}}</ref> In 2016, [[Mary Matalin]] was chosen for her fight for the humane treatment of farm animals and monkeys.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/gops-mary-matalin-is-petas-person-of-the-year|title=GOP's Mary Matalin is PETA's 'Person of the Year'|date=December 8, 2016|website=Washington Examiner|first=Paul|last=Bedard}}</ref> In 2017, PETA chose a nonhuman recipient, Naruto, a monkey unaware of [[monkey selfie copyright dispute|his role in a copyright case]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/monkey-selfie-peta-person-of-the-year-crested-black-macaque-copyright-lawsuit-naruto-david-slater-a8095496.html|title=Monkey that took selfie named 'Person of the Year' by PETA|date=December 6, 2017|website=The Independent|author=Independent Staff}}</ref>

==Positions==
===Direct action and the ALF===

Newkirk is outspoken in her support of [[direct action]], writing that no movement for social change has ever succeeded without what she calls the militarism component: "Thinkers may prepare revolutions, but bandits must carry them out."<ref name=NewkirkBest341>{{Cite book|title=Terrorists or Freedom Fighters? Reflections on the Liberation of Animals|last1=Best|first1=Steven|last2=Nocella|first2=Anthony J|date=2004|publisher=Lantern Books|isbn=159056054X|contributor-first=Ingrid|contributor-last=Newkirk|contribution=Afterword: The ALF: Who, Why, and What? (pages 341-343)|quote=I would hazard to say that no movement for social change has ever succeeded without 'the militarism component.' Not until black demonstrators resorted to violence did the national government work seriously for civil rights legislation. In the 1930s labor struggles had to turn violent before any significant gains were made. In 1850 white abolitionists, having given up on peaceful means, began to encourage and engage in actions that disrupted plantation operations and liberated slaves. Was that all wrong? ... There is a difference between violence to property and violence to people, of course. The ALF would not hurt a mouse, but it will burn a building. ... Thinkers may prepare revolutions, but bandits must carry them out.}}</ref> Newkirk is a strong supporter of direct action that removes animals from laboratories and other facilities: "When I hear of anyone walking into a lab and walking out with animals, my heart sings."<ref name=Rosenberg/> Newkirk was quoted in 1999, "When you see the resistance to basic humane treatment and to the acknowledgment of animals' social needs, I find it small wonder that the laboratories aren't all burning to the ground. If I had more guts, I'd light a match."<ref>Schneider, Alison. "As Threats of Violence Escalate, Primate Researchers Stand Firm", The Chronicle of Higher Education, November 12, 1999.</ref>

===Purebred dogs===
PETA protested at the [[Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show]] in 2009 dressed up in [[Ku Klux Klan]] robes and passed out brochures implying the Klan and [[American Kennel Club]] have the same goal of "pure bloodlines".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/2009-02-09-peta-westminster-kkk-protest_N.htm|title=PETA dresses in KKK garb outside Westminster Dog Show|date=February 10, 2009|first=Gene|last=Farris|url-status=unfit|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090304013225/https://www.usatoday.com/sports/2009-02-09-peta-westminster-kkk-protest_N.htm|archive-date=March 4, 2009|website=[[USA Today]]}}</ref>

===''Pet'' as word===
PETA considers the word ''pet'' to be "derogatory and patronises the animal", and prefers the term "companion" or "companion animal". "Animals are not pets," Newkirk has said.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/peta-pets-animals-good-morning-britain-piers-morgan-a9316471.html|title=PETA says word 'pet' is patronising to animals|date=February 4, 2020|website=[[The Independent]]|first=Kelli|last=Bender|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200205161904/https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/peta-pets-animals-good-morning-britain-piers-morgan-a9316471.html|archive-date=February 5, 2020}}</ref>

===Hearing-ear and Seeing-eye dogs===
PETA supports [[hearing dog]] programs when animals are sourced from shelters and placed in homes, but opposes [[Guide dog|seeing-eye-dog]] programs "because the dogs are bred as if there are no equally intelligent dogs literally dying for homes in shelters, they are kept in harnesses almost 24/7".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://latimesblogs.latimes.com/unleashed/2009/01/when-we-first-r.html|title=PETA's Vice President: We don't want to take your dog away|date=January 10, 2009|first=Lindsay|last=Barnett|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090119102011/https://latimesblogs.latimes.com/unleashed/2009/01/when-we-first-r.html|archive-date=January 19, 2009|website=[[LA Times]]}}</ref>

===Animal testing===

PETA opposes [[animal testing]]—whether toxicity testing, basic or applied research, or for education and training—on both moral and practical grounds. Newkirk told the ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'' magazine in 1989 that even if animal testing resulted in a cure for AIDS, PETA would oppose it.<ref>''Vogue'', September 1989.{{nonspecific|date=July 2020}}</ref> The group also believes that it is wasteful, unreliable, and irrelevant to human health, because artificially induced diseases in animals are not identical to human diseases. They say that animal experiments are frequently redundant and lack accountability, oversight, and regulation. They promote alternatives, including [[embryonic stem cell]] research and [[in vitro]] cell research.<ref name="Rosenberg" /> PETA employees have themselves volunteered for human testing of vaccines; Scott Van Valkenburg, the group's Director of Major Gifts, said in 1999 that he had volunteered for human testing of HIV vaccines.<ref>Van Valkenburg, Scott. [http://www.seattleweekly.com/1999-07-07/news/letters "Letters: White-coat welfare"], ''Seattle Weekly'', July 7, 1999; see [http://www.petavanguardsociety.com/Svalkenburg.asp Scott Van Valkenburg] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081211011259/http://www.petavanguardsociety.com/Svalkenburg.asp |date=2008-12-11 }}, PETA, accessed June 30, 2010.</ref>

===Milk and autism===
In 2008, 2014, and again in 2017, PETA conducted an [[advertising campaign]] linking milk with [[autism]]. Their "Got Autism?" campaign, a play on words [[Mockery|mocking]] the milk industry's [[Got Milk?]] ad campaign that ran from 1993-2014, stated "Studies have shown a link between cow's milk and autism." PETA also claimed milk was strongly linked to [[cancer]], [[Crohn's disease]], and other diseases.<ref name="sciencebasedmedicine1" /><ref name=autism2>{{Cite web|url=https://time.com/2798480/peta-autism-got-milk/|title="Got Autism?"

When pressed, PETA cited two scientific papers, one from 1995 and one from 2002 using a very small sampling of children (36 and 20), and neither showed a correlation nor a causation between milk and autism. Newer studies from 2010 and 2014 have shown no association between dairy and behavior in autism.<ref name=autism2 /> Despite having been corrected, PETA says they still keep the information on their website "because we have heard from people who have said it contains helpful information."<ref name=autism3 />

[[Steven Novella]], a [[neurology|clinical neurologist]] and [[Professors in the United States#Assistant Professor|assistant professor]] at [[Yale University School of Medicine]], wrote "This is clearly, in my opinion, a campaign of [[Fearmongering|fear mongering]] based upon a gross distortion of the [[scientific evidence]]. The purpose is to advocate for a [[vegan diet]], which fits [PETA's] [[Ideology|ideological]] agenda. They are likely aware that it is easier to spread fears than to reassure with a careful analysis of the scientific evidence."<ref name="sciencebasedmedicine1">{{cite web|last1=Novella|first1=Steven|title=PETA Embraces Autism Pseudoscience|url=http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/peta-embraces-autism-pseudoscience/|website=[[Science-Based Medicine]]|date=May 28, 2014|access-date=August 3, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200721213254/https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/peta-embraces-autism-pseudoscience/|archive-date=July 21, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>

PETA's campaign has angered the [[Societal and cultural aspects of autism|autism community]]. A 2008 PETA [[billboard]] was taken down by the [[Autistic Self Advocacy Network]]. In 2017, British food writer, journalist and [[hunger relief]] activist [[Jack Monroe]], demanded PETA remove her recipes from their website "with immediate effect coz I wrote them with my autism". They did, but PETA didn't remove the "Got Autism?" article from their website. The [[Frown|frowny face]] in the campaign image negatively [[stereotype]]s autistic people.<ref name=autism3>{{Cite web|url=https://www.plantbasednews.org/news/old-peta-advert-associating-milk-with-autism-has-caused-outrage|title=Old PETA Advert Associating Milk With Autism Causes Outrage|first=Diana|last=Lupica|date=October 11, 2017|website=Vegan News, Plant Based Living, Food, Health & more}}</ref>

===Steve Irwin controversy===
[[File:Steve irwin at Australia zoo cropped.jpg|right|thumb|Steve Irwin at [[Australia Zoo]]]]
PETA has been critical of Australian wildlife expert and zookeeper [[Steve Irwin]]. In 2006, when Irwin died, PETA Vice President [[Dan Mathews]] said Irwin had made a career out of antagonizing frightened wild animals.<ref name=Walls>{{Cite web|url=http://www.today.com/popculture/peta-sheds-no-crocodile-tears-steve-irwin-wbna14626178|title=PETA sheds no crocodile tears for Steve Irwin|website=TODAY.com|date=September 11, 2006|first=Jeannette|last=Walls

PETA and [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]] Animal Rahat, authorized by [[Animal Welfare Board of India]], participated in a nine-month investigation of 16 circuses in India. After it was revealed that "animals used in circuses were subjected to chronic confinement, physical abuse, and psychological torment", AWBI in 2013 banned registration of elephants for performance.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/elephants-still-being-subjected-to-torture-in-indian-circuses-peta-674933|title= Elephants Still Being Subjected to Torture in Indian Circuses: PETA|date=October 5, 2014|access-date = 16 May 2016|website=[[NDTV India]]}}</ref>

PETA India put up billboards prior to a 2020 annual religious event [[Eid al-Adha]] where animals are ritualistically slaughtered. The billboards depicted goats with the words "I am a living being and not just meat. Change your view towards us and become a vegan." and "I am ME, Not Mutton. See the Individual. Go Vegan."

==Position within the animal rights movement==

[[File:Ingrid Newkirk to David Shankbone on the Animal Liberation Front.ogg|thumb|right|Newkirk on clashes with other animal rights organizations and her feelings about the Animal Liberation Front (3:31)]]
The failure of PETA to condemn the [[Animal Liberation Front]] is a common complaint by other animal rights activists and groups.

The more radical activists say the group has lost touch with its grass-roots soldiers, is soft on the idea of animal rights, that it should stop the media stunts and their use of nudity, and stop "hogging the spotlight at the expense of its allies in the movement".<ref name=Phelps242>{{cite book|last=Phelps|first=Norm|author-link=Norm Phelps|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zrncZO5bmAgC&pg=PA242|title=The longest struggle: animal advocacy from Pythagoras to PETA|publisher=[[Lantern Books]]|date=2007|page=242|isbn=9781590561270}}</ref><ref name="Rosenberg" />

[[Robert Garner]] of the University of Leicester has written that PETA has shaken up the animal rights movement, setting up new groups and radicalizing old ones.<ref name=Garner70>{{cite book|last=Garner|first=Robert|author-link=Robert Garner|title=Animals, politics, and morality|publisher=[[Manchester University Press]]|date=1993|edition=2004|page=70|isbn=0719066204}}</ref> According to reviews at [[Philanthropedia]], "PETA paved the way for other national organizations to delve into what used to be controversial issues and are now more mainstream concerns."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.myphilanthropedia.org/top-nonprofits/national/animal-welfare-rights-protection/2011/peta-people-for-the-ethical-treatment-of-animals#strength_buckets|title=PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals)|access-date=October 20, 2015|page="Expert Reviews" tab|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130111024318/http://www.myphilanthropedia.org/top-nonprofits/national/animal-welfare-rights-protection/2011/peta-people-for-the-ethical-treatment-of-animals|archive-date=January 11, 2013}}</ref> [[Michael Specter]] considers PETA to be the radical that helps the more mainstream message to succeed.{{efn|"It has been argued many times that in any social movement there has to be somebody radical enough to alienate the mainstream–and to permit more moderate influences to prevail. For every Malcolm X there is a Martin Luther King, Jr., and for every Andrea Dworkin there is a Gloria Steinem. Newkirk and PETA provide a similar dynamic for groups like the Humane Society of the United States, which is the biggest animal-welfare organization in the country and far more moderate than PETA. When I asked Newkirk why she didn't enter political campaigns for animal action and lobby more vigorously on Capitol Hill for her positions, she laughed: "Are you kidding? Dear boy, we are the kiss of death. If we are involved, the legislation is automatically dead. We have members yelling at us, 'Why are you not working on these issues?' But activists just beg us to stay the hell out.""<ref name=Specter />}}

Because of PETA's euthanasia rates at their "shelter of last resort", attorney [[Nathan Winograd]], advocate for the [[No-kill shelter|No Kill movement]], calls Newkirk of PETA "The Butcher of Norfolk".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nathanwinograd.com/the-butcher-of-norfolk-6th-edition/|title=The Butcher of Norfolk (6th Edition)|date=February 23, 2012|first=Nathan J|last=Winograd|author-link=Nathan Winograd}}</ref>

[[Gary Francione]], professor of law at [[Rutgers Law School]] and a proponent of [[abolitionism (animal rights)|abolitionism]], says that PETA is not an animal rights group because of their willingness to work with industries that use animals to achieve incremental change. Francione says PETA trivializes the movement with their "Three Stooges" theory of animal rights, making the public think progress is underway when the changes are only cosmetic.<ref name="thunder">{{cite book|last=Francione|first=Gary|author-link=Gary Francione|date=2007|title=Rain without Thunder: The Ideology of the Animal Rights Movement|publisher=[[Temple University Press]]|page=67–77|isbn=978-1566394604}}</ref> "Their campaigns are selected more for media image than content."<ref name="Rosenberg" /> Francione has criticized PETA for having caused grassroots animal rights groups to close, groups that were essential for the survival of the animal rights movement, and rejects the centrality of corporate animal charities. Francione wrote that PETA initially set up independent chapters around the United States, but closed them in favor of a [[Hierarchical organization|top-down, centralized organization]], which not only consolidated decision-making power, but centralized donations. Now, local animal rights donations go to PETA, rather than to a local group.<ref name="thunder"/>
