==History==
[[File:Church near Junction City, Kansas.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Church near Junction City (1943)]] 
Junction City is so named from its position at the confluence of the [[Smoky Hill River|Smoky Hill]] and [[Republican River|Republican rivers]], which forms the [[Kansas River]].<ref>{{cite book | url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_Qi9cXyTWt9EC | title=Kansas: A Cyclopedia of State History | publisher=Standard Publishing Company | author=Blackmar, Frank Wilson | year=1912 | pages=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_Qi9cXyTWt9EC/page/n32 42]}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_9V1IAAAAMAAJ | title=The Origin of Certain Place Names in the United States | publisher=Govt.

In 1854, Andrew J. Mead of New York of the Cincinnati-Manhattan Company, [[Free-Stater (Kansas)|Free Staters]] connected to the [[Massachusetts Emigrant Aid Company]] planned a community there called '''Manhattan''' (there was also a discussion to call it '''New Cincinnati''').<ref name="kansastowns.us">{{cite web|url=http://www.kansastowns.us/junchist.html|title=Junction City, Kansas History|website=www.kansastowns.us|access-date=7 April 2018}}</ref>  When the steamship ''Hartford'' delivering the immigrants could not reach the community because of low water on the Kansas River, the Free Staters settled 20 miles east in what today is [[Manhattan, Kansas]]. The community was renamed '''Millard City''' for Captain Millard of the Hartford on October 3, 1855. It was renamed briefly '''Humboldt''' in 1857 by local farmers and renamed again later that year to Junction City.<ref>[http://www.jcks.com/aboutus/history.html GEARY COUNTY LEGENDS - jcks.com - Retrieved March 9, 2009] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120212141938/http://www.jcks.com/aboutus/history.html |date=February 12, 2012 }}</ref>  It was formally incorporated in 1859.<ref name="kansastowns.us"/>

In 1923, [[John R. Brinkley]] established Radio Station KFKB (which stood for ‘’Kansas First, Kansas Best’’) using a 1&nbsp;kW transmitter. It is one of the first—if not the very first—radio stations in Kansas. Brinkley used the station to espouse his belief that goat testicles could be implanted in men to enhance their virility.<ref>{{cite news |first= John K.|last= Hutchens|title=Notes on the Late Dr. John R.

Among Junction City's residents is film director [[Kevin Wilmott]], whose movies, including [[Ninth Street]], are set in Junction City. Ninth Street specifically refers to a bawdy area of the community that was frequented by Fort Riley soldiers in the 1960s.<ref>[http://www2.ku.edu/~kuthf/willmott.html Kevin Wilmott, Assistant Professor - ku.edu - Retrieved March 9, 2009] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060906232348/http://www2.ku.edu/~kuthf/willmott.html |date=September 6, 2006 }}</ref> In the 1980s a major initiative was undertaken to clean up the Ninth St. area.{{citation needed|date=March 2011}}

[[Timothy McVeigh]] rented the Ryder truck he used in the [[Oklahoma City bombing]] from an auto body shop in Junction City.

==Geography==
According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|12.22|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which {{convert|12.15|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{convert|0.07|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is water.<ref name="Gazetteer files">{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010 |url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |access-date=2012-07-06 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120702145235/http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |archive-date=2012-07-02 }}</ref>

==Climate==
Over the course of a year, temperatures range from an average low of about {{convert|15|°F|°C|abbr=on}} in January to an average high of {{convert|90|°F|°C|abbr=on}} in July.  The maximum temperature reaches {{convert|90|°F|°C|abbr=on}} an average of 47 days per year and reaches {{convert|100|°F|°C|abbr=on}} an average of 7 days per year.  The minimum temperature falls below the freezing point (32&nbsp;°F) an average of 126 days per year.  Typically the first fall freeze occurs during the month of October, and the last spring freeze occurs during the month of April.{{citation needed|date=March 2011}}

The area receives over {{convert|32|in|mm}} of precipitation during an average year with the largest share being received during May, June, and July—with a combined 29 days of measurable precipitation.  During a typical year the total amount of precipitation may be anywhere from 23 to {{convert|43|in|mm}}.  There are on average 86 days of measurable precipitation per year.  Winter snowfall averages less than {{convert|14|in|mm}}, but the median is just over {{convert|7|in|mm}}.  Measurable snowfall occurs an average of 6 days per year with at least an inch of snow being received on four of those days.  Snow depth of at least an inch occurs an average of 17 days per year.{{citation needed|date=March 2011}}
