<!-- Definition -->
'''Driving under the influence''' ('''DUI''') is the crime or offense of driving, operating, or being in control of a [[motor vehicle]] while impaired by [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] or other [[drug]]s (including [[recreational drug]]s and those prescribed by [[physicians]]), to a level that renders the driver incapable of operating a motor vehicle safely.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Walsh |first1=J.

==Terminology==
Also called '''driving while impaired'''/'''driving while intoxicated''' ('''DWI'''), '''drunk driving''', '''operating while intoxicated''' ('''OWI'''), '''operating [a] vehicle under the influence of alcohol or drugs''' ('''OVI''') in Ohio, '''drink-driving''' (UK/Ireland), or '''impaired driving''' (Canada).

The name of the offense varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and from legal to colloquial terminology. In the United States, the specific [[criminal offense]] is usually called driving under the influence, but in some states "driving while intoxicated" (DWI), "operating while impaired" (OWI) or "operating while ability impaired", "operating a vehicle under the influence" (OVI), etc.<ref name="Wanberg">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zKERgpH5q6gC&pg=PA14|title=Driving With Care:Education and Treatment of the Impaired Driving Offender-Strategies for Responsible Living: The Provider′s Guide|last1=Wanberg|first1=Kenneth W.|last2=Milkman|first2=Harvey B.|last3=Timkin|first3=David S.|date=2004-12-03|publisher=SAGE Publications, Inc|isbn=9781412905961|edition=1|location=Thousand Oaks, Calif.|language=en|pages=14}}</ref> Such laws may also apply to boating or piloting aircraft. Vehicles can include [[farm machinery]] and horse-drawn carriages.  Other commonly used terms to describe these offenses include drinking and driving, drunk driving, drunken driving, impaired driving, operating under the influence, or "over the prescribed limit".

In the United Kingdom, there are two separate offences to do with alcohol and driving. The first is "Driving or attempting to drive with excess alcohol" (legal code DR10), the other is known as "In charge of a vehicle with excess alcohol" (legal code DR40) or "drunk in charge" due to the wording of the [[Licensing Act 1872]].<ref>https://www.drivingdefences.co.uk/drink-driving/drink-drive-penalties/</ref><ref name="Merritt">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0DWdtfaVCzYC&pg=PT296|title=Law for Student Police Officers|last=Merritt|first=Jonathan|date=2009-07-09|publisher=SAGE|isbn=9781844455638|language=en}}</ref> In relation to motor vehicles, the [[Road Traffic Act 1988]] creates a narrower offense of driving (or being in charge of) a vehicle while having breath, blood, or urine alcohol levels above the prescribed limits (colloquially called "being over the limit"); and a broader offense of "driving while unfit through drink or drugs," (DR20 and DR80 respectively) which can apply even with levels below the limits.<ref name="Hannibal">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e-yNAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA57|title=Practice Notes on Road Traffic Law 2/e|last1=Hannibal|first1=Martin|last2=Hardy|first2=Stephen|date=2013-03-04|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781135346386|language=en|pages=57–68}}</ref> A separate offense in the 1988 Act applies to bicycles.

The criminal offense may not involve actual driving of the vehicle, but rather may broadly include being physically "in control" of a car while intoxicated, even if the person charged is not in the act of driving.<ref name="voaslacey">{{cite journal|last1=Voas|first1=Robert B.|last2=Lacey|first2=John H.|title=Issues in the enforcement of impaired driving laws in the United States|publisher=Pennsylvania State University|citeseerx=10.1.1.553.1031}}</ref><ref name="teklev">{{cite web|last1=Tekenos-Levy|first1=Jordan|title=Impaired Driving in Canada: Cost and Effect of a Conviction|url=https://www.ncdd.com/blog/559292f7a6ec618756688282/impaired-driving-in-canada-cost-and-effect-of-a-conviction|website=National College for DUI Defense|access-date=1 August 2017|date=29 July 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170801080436/https://www.ncdd.com/blog/559292f7a6ec618756688282/impaired-driving-in-canada-cost-and-effect-of-a-conviction|archive-date=1 August 2017}}</ref> For example, a person found in the [[driver's seat]] of a car while intoxicated and holding the car keys, even while parked, may be charged with DUI, because he or she is in control of the vehicle. 

In construing the terms DUI, DWI, OWI, and OVI, some states{{which|date=September 2020}} therefore make it illegal to ''drive a motor vehicle'' while under the influence or driving while intoxicated while others indicate that it is illegal to ''operate a motor vehicle''. There is a split of authority across the U.S. regarding this issue. Some states{{which|date=September 2020}} permit enforcement of DUI/DWI and OWI/OVI statutes based on "operation and control" of a vehicle, while others{{which|date=September 2020}} require actual "driving". "The distinction between these two terms is material, for it is generally held that the word 'drive,' as used in statutes of this kind, usually denotes movement of the vehicle in some direction, whereas the word 'operate' has a broader meaning so as to include not only the motion of the vehicle but also acts which engage the machinery of the vehicle that, alone or in sequence, will set in motion the motive power of the vehicle." (''State v. Graves'' (1977) 269 S.C. 356 [237 S.E.2d 584, 586-588, 586. fn. 8].)

''[[Merriam Webster]]'s Dictionary'' defines DUI (in the United States) as "1. the act or crime of driving a vehicle while affected by alcohol or drugs; 2. an arrest or conviction for driving under the influence; 3. a person who is arrested for or convicted of driving under the influence."<ref>{{Cite web|title = DUI {{!}} the crime of driving a vehicle while drunk also: a person who is arrested for driving a vehicle while drunk|url = http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/dui|website = www.merriam-webster.com|access-date = 2015-09-29}}</ref>

==Alcohol==
{{main|Drunk drivers}}

With alcohol consumption, a [[drunk driver]]'s level of intoxication is typically determined by a measurement of [[blood alcohol content]] or BAC; but this can also be expressed as a breath test measurement, often referred to as a BrAC. A BAC or BrAC measurement in excess of the specific threshold level, such as 0.08%, defines the [[criminal offense]] with no need to prove impairment.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Nelson|first1=Bruce|title=Nevada's Driving Under the Influence (DUI) laws|url=http://nvpac.nv.gov/DUIhome/|website=NVPAC|publisher=Advisory Council for Prosecuting Attorneys|access-date=3 July 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170422000604/http://nvpac.nv.gov/DUIhome/|archive-date=2017-04-22|url-status=dead}}</ref> In some jurisdictions, there is an aggravated category of the offense at a higher BAC level, such as 0.12%, 0.15%, or 0.25%. In many jurisdictions, police officers can conduct field tests of suspects to look for signs of intoxication. The US state of Colorado has a maximum blood content of [[THC]] for drivers who have consumed [[cannabis]], but it has been difficult to enforce.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thedenverchannel.com/news/360/bill-to-change-dui-marijuana-impairment-laws-postponed-but-sparking-conversation|title=Bill to change DUI marijuana impairment laws postponed|date=2019-02-13|website=KMGH|language=en|access-date=2019-04-03}}</ref>

In some countries, it is measured and known in gram per blood liter, with 0.5 g/L similar to a 0.05% rate, other use per mille (per thousand sign) with 0.5‰ = 0.05%.

===Blood alcohol content===

[[File:Bafometro.JPG|right|thumb|A law enforcement grade Breathalyzer, specifically an Alco-Sensor IV]]

Drinking enough [[ethyl alcohol|alcohol]] to cause a [[blood alcohol concentration]] (BAC) of 0.03–0.12% typically causes a [[Alcohol flush reaction|flushed, red appearance in the face]] and impaired judgment and fine muscle coordination. A BAC of 0.09% to 0.25% causes [[lethargy]], [[sedation]], balance problems, and blurred vision. A BAC from 0.18% to 0.30% causes profound confusion, impaired speech (e.g., slurred speech), staggering, dizziness, and vomiting. A BAC from 0.25% to 0.40% causes [[stupor]], unconsciousness, [[anterograde amnesia]], vomiting, and [[respiratory depression]] (potentially life-threatening). A BAC from 0.35% to 0.80% causes a [[coma]] (unconsciousness), life-threatening respiratory depression, and possibly fatal [[alcohol poisoning]]. There are a number of factors that affect when your BAC will reach or exceed 0.08, including how much you weigh, the time frame that you have been drinking, and if you ate within the time of drinking. A 170 lbs male can drink more than a 135 lbs female, before being over the BAC level. <ref>National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). BAC Estimator [computer program]. Springfield, VA: National Technical Information Service, 1992.</ref>

A [[breathalyzer]] is a device for estimating BAC from a breath sample. It was developed by inventor [[Robert Frank Borkenstein]]<ref name=borkenstein>{{cite news |author=Douglas Martin (reporter) |title=Robert F. Borkenstein, 89, Inventor of the Breathalyzer |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/08/17/us/robert-f-borkenstein-89-inventor-of-the-breathalyzer.html |quote=Robert F. Borkenstein, who revolutionized enforcement of drunken driving laws by inventing the Breathalyzer to measure alcohol in the blood, died last Saturday at his home in Bloomington, Ind. He was 89. ...Robert Frank Borkenstein was born in Fort Wayne, Ind., on Aug. 31, 1912.  |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=August 17, 2002 |access-date=2013-12-23 }}</ref> and registered as a trademark in 1954, but many people use the term to refer to any generic device for estimating [[blood alcohol content]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tess2.uspto.gov/bin/showfield?f=doc&state=4802:z6a5w4.2.16 |title=Breathalyzer |date=May 13, 1958 |access-date=2014-01-03 |publisher=[[USPTO]] }}</ref> With the advent of a scientific test for BAC, law enforcement regimes moved from sobriety tests (e.g., asking the suspect to stand on one leg) to having more than a prescribed amount of blood alcohol content while driving. However, this does not preclude the simultaneous existence and use of the older subjective tests in which [[police officer]]s measure the intoxication of the suspect by asking them to do certain activities or by examining their eyes and responses.  BAC is most conveniently measured as a simple percent of alcohol in the blood by weight.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/2090019-overview | title=Ethanol Level | access-date=7 October 2014}}</ref> Research shows an exponential increase of the relative risk for a crash with a linear increase of BAC as shown 
{{clarify span|explain=What illustration?|in the illustration.|date=September 2020}} BAC does not depend on any units of measurement.  In Europe, it is usually expressed as milligrams of alcohol per 100 milliliters of blood. However, 100 milliliters of blood weighs essentially the same as 100 milliliters of water, which weighs precisely 100&nbsp;grams. Thus, for all practical purposes, this is the same as the simple dimensionless BAC measured as a percent. The [[per mille]] (''promille'') measurement, which is equal to ten times the percentage value, is used in Denmark, Germany, Finland, Norway, and Sweden.<ref>{{cite web|title=On DWI Laws in Other Countries|url=https://one.nhtsa.gov/people/injury/research/pub/DWIothercountries/dwiothercountries.html|website=National Highway Traffic Safety Administration|access-date=1 August 2017|date=March 2000}}</ref>

Depending on the jurisdiction, BAC may be measured by police using three methods: blood, breath, or urine. For law enforcement purposes, breath is the preferred method, since results are available almost instantaneously. The validity of the testing equipment/methods and mathematical relationships for the measurement of breath and blood alcohol have been criticized.<ref>Bates, Marsha E. "Journal of Studies on Alcohol and Drugs." The Correspondence between Saliva and Breath Estimates of Blood Alcohol Concentration: Advantages and Limitations of the Saliva Method". ''Journal of Studies in Alcohol'', 1 Jan. 1993. Web. 13 Mar. 2013.</ref> Improper testing and equipment calibration is often used in defense of a DUI or DWI. There have been cases in Canada where officers have come upon a suspect who is unconscious after an accident and officers have taken a blood sample.

Driving while consuming alcohol may be illegal within a jurisdiction. In some, it is illegal for an [[United States open-container laws|open container]] of an alcoholic beverage to be in the passenger compartment of a motor vehicle or in some specific area of that compartment. There have been cases of drivers being convicted of a DUI when they were not observed driving after being proven in court they had been driving while under the influence.<ref name="voaslacey"/><ref name="teklev"/>

In the case of an accident, [[car insurance]] may be automatically declared invalid for the intoxicated driver; the drunk driver would be fully responsible for damages. In the American system, a citation for driving under the influence also causes a major increase in car insurance premiums.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Tchir|first1=Jason|title=How an impaired driving conviction can affect your car insurance rates|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-drive/news/industry-news/how-an-impaired-driving-conviction-can-affect-your-car-insurance-rates/article19100767/|access-date=1 August 2017|agency=Globe and Mail|date=10 June 2014}}</ref>

The German model serves to reduce the number of accidents by identifying unfit drivers and revoking their licenses until their fitness to drive has been established again. The [[Medical Psychological Assessment]] (MPA) works for a prognosis of the fitness for drive in future, has an interdisciplinary basic approach, and offers the chance of individual rehabilitation to the offender.<ref name="müller laub">{{cite web|url=http://www.fit-to-drive.com/2006/downloads/Mueller_Laub.pdf|title=The Medical Psychological Assessment: An Opportunity for the Individual, Safety for the Genera Public|format=PD|access-date=2012-10-10}}</ref>

George Smith, a [[London Taxi]] [[cab driver]], ended up being the first person to be convicted of driving a motor vehicle while intoxicated, on September 10, 1897, under the "drunk in charge" provision of the 1872 Licensing Act.

Driving under the influence is one of the largest risk factors that contribute to [[Traffic collision|traffic collisions]]. For people in Europe between the age of 15 and 29, driving under the influence is one of the main causes of mortality.<ref name="Alonso, Pastor 2015">{{cite journal|last1=Alonso|first1=Francisco|last2=Pasteur|first2=Juan C.|last3=Montero|first3=Luis|last4=Esteban|first4=Cristina|title=Driving under the influence of alcohol: frequency, reasons, perceived risk and punishment|journal=Substance Abuse Treatment, Prevention, and Policy|date=2015|volume=10|issue=11|pages=11|doi=10.1186/s13011-015-0007-4|pmid=25880078|pmc=4359384}}</ref> According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, alcohol-related crashes cause approximately $37 billion in damages annually.<ref name="nhtsa.gov">{{Cite web|title = Impaired Driving {{!}} National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA)|url = http://www.nhtsa.gov/Impaired|website = www.nhtsa.gov|access-date = 2015-09-29}}</ref> DUI and alcohol-related crashes produce an estimated $45 billion in damages every year.

====Grand Rapids Dip====

Some studies suggest that a BAC of 0.01–0.04% would have a lower risk of collisions compared to a BAC of 0%, referred to as the ''Grand Rapids Effect'' or ''Grand Rapids Dip'',<ref name="grandrapids"/><ref name="ntsb_grandrapids">{{cite web|url=https://one.nhtsa.gov/people/injury/research/pub/impaired_driving/BAC/introduction.html|title=Driver Characteristics and Impairment at Various BACs - Introduction|website=one.nhtsa.gov}}</ref> based on a seminal research study by Borkenstein, et al.<ref name="borkenstein-papers">[http://webapp1.dlib.indiana.edu/findingaids/view?doc.view=entire_text&docId=InU-Ar-VAC0762 Robert F. Borkenstein papers, 1928-2002], Indiana U.

Borkenstein Courses], Indiana U.</ref>  One study suggests that a BAC of 0.04–0.05% would slightly increase the risk.<ref name="grandrapids" />

Some literature has attributed the ''Grand Rapids Effect'' to erroneous data or asserted (without support) that it was possibly due to drivers exerting extra caution at low BAC levels or to "experience" in drinking.  Other explanations are that this effect is at least in part the blocking effect of ethanol [[excitotoxicity]] and the effect of alcohol in [[essential tremor]] and other movement disorders,<ref name="pmid20721919">{{cite journal | vauthors = Mostile G, Jankovic J | title = Alcohol in essential tremor and other movement disorders | journal = Movement Disorders | volume = 25 | issue = 14 | pages = 2274–84 | date = October 2010 | pmid = 20721919 | doi = 10.1002/mds.23240 }}</ref> but this remains speculative.

Both the influential study by Borkenstein, et al. and the empirical German data on the 1990s demonstrated that the risk of collisions is lower or the same for drivers with a BAC of 0.04% or less than for drivers with a BAC of 0%. For a BAC of 0.15%, the risk is 25-fold. The 0.05% BAC limit in Germany (since 1998, 0.08% since 1973) and the limits in many other countries were set based on the study by Borkenstein, et al.<ref name="grandrapids"/> [[Würzburg University]] researchers showed that all extra collisions caused by alcohol were due to at least 0.06% BAC, 96% of them due to BAC above 0.08%, and 79% due to BAC above 0.12%. In their study based on the 1990s German data, the effect of alcohol was higher for almost all BAC levels than in Borkenstein, et al.

==Other drugs==
For drivers suspected of [[drug-impaired driving]], drug testing screens are typically performed in scientific laboratories so that the results will be admissible in evidence at trial. Due to the overwhelming number of impairing substances that are not alcohol, drugs are classified into different categories for detection purposes. Drug impaired drivers still show impairment during the battery of standardized field sobriety tests, but there are additional tests to help detect drug impaired driving.

The Drug Evaluation and Classification program is designed to detect a drug impaired driver and classify the categories of drugs present in his or her system. The DEC program breaks down detection into a twelve-step process that a government-certified Drug Recognition Expert (DRE) can use to determine the category or categories of drugs that a suspect is impaired by. The twelve steps are:

#Breath Alcohol Test
#Interview with arresting officer (who notes slurred speech, alcohol on breath, etc.)
#Preliminary evaluation
#Evaluation of the eyes
#Psychomotor tests
#Vital signs
#Dark room examinations
#Muscle tone
#Injection sites (for injection of [[heroin]] or other drugs)
#Interrogation of suspect
#Opinion of the evaluator
#Toxicological examination<ref>{{cite book|title=Drug Evaluation and Classification Program|publisher=NHTSA|pages=Sev IV Pg. 5–6}}</ref>

DREs are qualified to offer expert testimony in court that pertains to impaired driving on drugs. The use of the twelve step process is scientifically validated by numerous field studies.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}

===Recreational drugs===

Drivers who have smoked or otherwise consumed [[cannabis]] products such as [[marijuana]] or [[hashish]] can be charged and convicted of impaired driving in some jurisdictions. A 2011 study in the ''B.C. Medical Journal'' stated that there "...is clear evidence that cannabis, like alcohol, impairs the psychomotor skills required for safe driving."

==Field sobriety testing==
{{Main|Field sobriety testing}}
To attempt to determine whether a suspect is impaired, police officers in the United States usually will administer field sobriety tests to determine whether the officer has [[probable cause]] to arrest an individual for suspicion of driving under the influence (DUI).

A police officer in the United States must have [[Probable cause|Probable Cause]] to make an arrest for driving under the influence. In establishing probable cause for a DUI arrest officers frequently consider the suspect's performance of Standardized Field Sobriety Tests.  The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) developed a system for validating field sobriety tests that led to the creation of the Standardized Field Sobriety Test (SFST) battery of tests.  The [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] (NHTSA) established a standard battery of three roadside tests that are recommended to be administered in a standardized manner in making this arrest decision.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nhtsa.gov/About+NHTSA/Traffic+Techs/current/Standardized+Field+Sobriety+Test+(SFST)+Validated+at+BACS+Below+0.10+Percent|title=Standardized Field Sobriety Test (SFST) Validated at BACS Below 0.10 Percent {{!}} National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA)|website=www.nhtsa.gov|access-date=2016-03-02|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160301215848/http://www.nhtsa.gov/About+NHTSA/Traffic+Techs/current/Standardized+Field+Sobriety+Test+(SFST)+Validated+at+BACS+Below+0.10+Percent|archive-date=2016-03-01}}</ref> There are Non-Standardized Field Sobriety Tests as well; however, the Non-Standardized Field Sobriety Tests have not received NHTSA Validation. This is the difference between the "Standardized" and the "Non-Standardized" Field Sobriety Tests.  The NHTSA has published numerous training manuals associated with SFSTs. As a result of the NHTSA studies, the Walk-and-Turn test was determined to be 68% accurate in predicting whether a test subject is at or above 0.08%, and the One-Leg Stand Test was determined to be 65% accurate in predicting whether a test subject is at or above 0.08% when the tests are properly administered to people within the study parameters.

The three validated tests by NHTSA are:
* The Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus Test, which involves following an object with the eyes (such as a pen or other stimulus) to determine characteristic eye movement reaction to the stimulus
* The Walk-and-Turn Test (heel-to-toe in a straight line). This test is designed to measure a person's ability to follow directions and remember a series of steps while dividing attention between physical and mental tasks.
* The One-Leg-Stand Test

Alternative tests, which have not been validated by the NHTSA, include the following:
* The Romberg Test, or the Modified-Position-of-Attention Test, (feet together, head back, eyes closed for thirty seconds).
* The Finger-to-Nose Test (tip head back, eyes closed, touch the tip of nose with tip of index finger).
* The Alphabet Test (recite all or part of the alphabet).
* The Finger Count Test (touch each finger of hand to thumb counting with each touch (1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 3, 2, 1)).
* The Counting Test (counting backwards from a number ending in a digit other than 5 or 0 and stopping at a number ending in a digit other than 5 or 0. The series of numbers should be more than 15).
* The Preliminary Alcohol Screening Test, PAS Test or PBT, (breathe into a "portable or preliminary breath tester", PAS Test or PBT).

In the US, field sobriety tests are voluntary; however, some states mandate commercial drivers accept preliminary breath tests (PBT).

===Preliminary Breath Test (PBT) or Preliminary Alcohol Screening test (PAS)===
{{See also|Breathalyzer#Preliminary_Breath_Test_(PBT)_or_Preliminary_Alcohol_Screening_test_(PAS)}}
The Preliminary Breath Test (PBT) or Preliminary Alcohol Screening test (PAS) is sometimes categorised as part of ''field sobriety testing'', although it is not part of the series of performance tests.  The PBT (or PAS) uses a portable breath tester.   While the tester provides numerical blood alcohol content (BAC) readings, its primary use is for screening and establishing [[probable cause|probable cause for arrest]], to invoke the [[Implied consent#Driving while intoxicated|implied consent]] requirements.  In US law, this is necessary to sustain a conviction based on evidential testing (or implied consent refusal).<ref name="nolo_ref">[https://dui.drivinglaws.org/resources/dui-refusal-blood-breath-urine-test.htm DUI: Refusal to Take a Field Test, or Blood, Breath or Urine Test], NOLO Press</ref>  Regardless of the terminology, in order to sustain a conviction based on evidential tests, ''probable cause'' must be shown (or the suspect must volunteer to take the evidential test without [[Implied consent#Driving while intoxicated|implied consent]] requirements being invoked).<ref name="nolo_ref" />

Refusal to take a preliminary breath test (PBT) in Michigan subjects a non-commercial driver to a "civil infraction" penalty, with no violation "points",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.michigan.gov/sos/0,4670,7-127-1627_8665-24488--,00.html|title=SOS - Substance Abuse and Driving}}</ref> but is not considered to be a refusal under the general "implied consent" law.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/813.136|title=ORS 813.136 (2015) - Consequence of refusal or failure to submit to field sobriety tests|first=Oregon Legislative Counsel|last=Committee}}</ref>  In some states, the state may present evidence of refusal to take a field sobriety test in court, although this is of questionable probative value in a drunk driving prosecution.

Different requirements apply in many states to drivers under DUI probation, in which case participation in a preliminary breath test (PBT) may be a condition of probation.  Some US states, notably California, have statutes on the books penalizing PBT refusal for drivers under 21; however, the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Constitutionality]] of those statutes has not been tested.  (As a practical matter, most criminal lawyers advise not engaging in discussion or "justifying" a refusal with the police.)

Commercial drivers are subject to PBT testing in some US states as a "drug screening" requirement.

===Testing for cannabis===
In the recent wake of legalized marijuana, law enforcement has sought a method of breath testing to determine the content of THC present in an individual. Law enforcement efficiently combats driving under the influence with tools like breathalyzers during field sobriety tests. Excluding edibles, a THC breathalyzer has the potential to measure how "high" an individual may be at the time. The legality of marijuana does not entail safety on the road, and accurate methods have become required to determine driver impairment. A THC breathalyzer could revolutionize roadside sobriety testing for drivers suspected of impairment.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Smith|first1=Aaron|title=These companies are racing to develop a Breathalyzer for pot|url=https://money.cnn.com/2017/05/26/news/marijuana-breathalyzer/index.html|access-date=1 August 2017|agency=CNN Money|date=26 May 2017}}</ref>

==Other charges==

In the US state of Colorado, impaired drivers may potentially be charged with child [[endangerment]] if they are arrested for DUI with minor children in the vehicle.<ref>{{cite web|title=Child Endangerment Drunk Driving Laws|url=http://www.madd.org/laws/law-overview/DUI_Child_Endangerment_Overview.pdf|website=MADD|access-date=1 August 2017|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170329050449/http://www.madd.org/laws/law-overview/DUI_Child_Endangerment_Overview.pdf|archive-date=29 March 2017}}</ref>

{{Main|Drunk driving law by country}}
The laws relating to drunk driving vary between countries or subnational regions (e.g., states or provinces), and varying [[blood alcohol content]] is required before a  charge or conviction can be made.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://scc.lexum.org/en/1970/1970scr0-777/1970scr0-777.html|title=Supreme Court of Canada - Decisions - Criminal Law Amendment Act, Reference|publisher=Scc.lexum.org|date=1970-06-26|access-date=2012-10-10|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120505123314/http://scc.lexum.org/en/1970/1970scr0-777/1970scr0-777.html|archive-date=2012-05-05}}</ref>

The specific criminal offense may be called, depending on the jurisdiction, "driving under the influence" [of alcohol or other drugs] (DUI), "driving under the influence of intoxicants" (DUII), "driving while impaired" (DWI), "operating vehicle under the influence of alcohol or other drugs" (OVI), "operating under the influence" (OUI), "operating while intoxicated" (OWI), "operating a motor vehicle while intoxicated" (OMVI), "driving under the combined influence of alcohol or other drugs", "driving under the influence per se" or "drunk in charge" [of a vehicle]. Many such laws apply also to motorcycling, [[boating]], piloting aircraft, use of mobile farm equipment such as tractors and combines, riding horses or driving a [[horse-drawn vehicle]], or bicycling, possibly with different [[blood alcohol content|BAC]] level than driving. In some jurisdictions, there are separate charges depending on the vehicle used, such as BWI (bicycling while intoxicated), which may carry a lighter sentence.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}

Some jurisdictions have multiple levels of BAC for different categories of drivers; for example, the state of [[California]] has a general 0.08% BAC limit, a lower limit of 0.04% for commercial operators, and a limit of 0.01% for drivers who are under 21 or on probation for previous DUI offenses.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dmv.ca.gov/pubs/curriculum/Chart%2010%20BAC%20Chart.pdf|title=Actions Resulting In Loss Of License Alcohol Impairment Charts|access-date=2012-10-10}}</ref> In some jurisdictions, impaired drivers who injure or kill another person while driving may face heavier penalties.

Some jurisdictions have judicial guidelines requiring a [[mandatory sentencing|mandatory minimum sentence]].{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

DUI convictions may result in multi-year jail terms and other penalties ranging from fines and other financial penalties to forfeiture of one's license plates and vehicle. In many jurisdictions, a judge may also order the installation of an [[ignition interlock device]]. Some jurisdictions require that drivers convicted of DUI offenses use special [[license plates]] that are easily distinguishable from regular plates. These plates are known in popular parlance as "party plates"<ref>{{cite web|author=Gus Chan, The Plain Dealer|url=http://blog.cleveland.com/metro/2011/01/cuyahoga_county_councils_final.html|title=Cuyahoga County Council's finalists for boards of revision include employee with criminal past|publisher=Blog.cleveland.com|date=2011-01-10|access-date=2014-01-26}}</ref> or "whiskey plates".

In many countries, [[sobriety checkpoint]]s (roadblocks of police cars where drivers are checked), driver's licence suspensions, fines, and prison sentences for DUI offenders are used as part of an effort to deter impaired driving. In addition, many countries have prevention campaigns that use [[advertising]] to make people aware of the danger of driving while impaired and the potential fines and criminal charges, discourage impaired driving, and encourage drivers to take taxis or public transport home after using alcohol or other drugs. In some jurisdictions, a [[Dram shop|bar or restaurant that serves an impaired driver]] may face civil liability for injuries caused by that driver. In some countries, non-profit advocacy organizations, a well-known example being [[Mothers Against Drunk Driving]] (MADD) run their own publicity campaigns against drunk driving.

=== Argentina ===
In Argentina, it is a criminal offence to drive if one's level of alcohol is 0.03% or greater at local/municipal jurisdiction, stopped by a municipal police force and 0.04% if driving on a route or highway and stopped by a State Highway Patrol, Argentina Federal Police, or Argentina Gendarmerie. At the Cordoba State highways and routes, a zero-tolerance policy is enforced by Cordoba State Highway Patrol and it is an offence to drive with an alcohol level greater than 0.00%.

=== Australia ===
In Australia it is a criminal offence to drive under the influence of alcohol if one's level of alcohol is 0.05% or greater (full licence) or if one's level of alcohol is greater than 0.00% (learner/provisional).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://roadsafety.transport.nsw.gov.au/stayingsafe/alcoholdrugs/drinkdriving/bac/index.html|title=Blood alcohol limits|last=Wales|first=Transport for New South|date=2016-02-03|website=roadsafety.transport.nsw.gov.au|language=en|access-date=2019-02-04}}</ref> Australian police utilise random breath testing stations, and any police vehicle can pull over any vehicle at any time to conduct a random breath or drug test.

Commentary varies on taking Standardised Field Sobriety Tests (SFSTs) in Canada.  Some sources, especially official ones, indicate that the SFSTs are mandatory,<ref name="sfj">[https://stepstojustice.ca/common-question-step/1-do-roadside-standardized-field-sobriety-test What are my rights if the police think I’ve been taking drugs and driving?], Steps to Justice (advises that FST is mandatory)</ref><ref>[Breathalyzer and roadside tests (Ont.)], legalline.ca</ref><ref name="rcmp">[http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/ts-sr/aldr-id-cfa-aldr-eng.htm Alcohol and Drug Impaired Driving - Tests, Criminal Charges, Penalties, Suspensions and Prohibitions] - RCMP</ref> whereas other sources are silent on FST testing.<ref name="gm">[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-drive/culture/commuting/what-must-i-legally-do-when-police-pull-me-over/article25829415/ What must I legally do when police pull me over?], ''Globe and Mail'', 4-Aug-2015</ref>  The assertion regarding mandatory compliance with SFSTs is based on "failure to comply with a demand", as an offence under §&nbsp;254(5) of the Criminal Code, but it is unclear how refusal of SFSTs are treated (provided the suspect agrees to take a chemical test).  There are some reports that refusal to submit to an SFST can result in the same penalties as impaired driving.

Nevertheless, it is unclear whether there has ever been a prosecution under this interpretation of "failure to comply with a demand" as applied to SFSTs.  Canada Criminal Code §&nbsp;254(1) and (5) addresses this, but only with respect to chemical testing (breath, blood, etc.)<ref name="C-46_254">{{cite web|url=https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/section-254.html|title=Consolidated federal laws of canada, Criminal Code|first=Legislative Services|last=Branch|date=8 April 2019|website=laws-lois.justice.gc.ca}}</ref>

In [[British law]] it is a criminal offence to be '''drunk in charge''' of a motor vehicle. The definition depends on such things as being in or near the vehicle, and having access to a means of starting the vehicle's engine and driving it away (i.e., the keys to the vehicle).

The UK's drug driving laws were amended in 2015. The changes included a new roadside testing kit, which could detect the presence of cocaine and cannabis in a suspect's saliva and zero tolerance limits for a number of illegal drugs. Limits were also set for certain prescription medications. The laws, however, did not end the use of the field impairment test, but made them more relevant for determining driver impairment by those drugs that are not now covered by the new legislation, or cannot be identified by the limited use of a device, that currently are only authorised for cannabis and cocaine.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Waugh|first1=Rob|title=How UK's new drug-driving laws really work – as first drivers are charged|url=http://metro.co.uk/2015/05/12/how-uks-new-drug-driving-laws-really-work-as-first-drivers-are-charged-5193600/|access-date=1 August 2017|agency=Metro|date=12 May 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Adams|first1=Lucy|title=Drug-driving limits and roadside testing to be introduced|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-39655137|access-date=1 August 2017|agency=BBC|date=21 April 2017}}</ref>

Under the laws of the United States, it is unlawful to drive a motor vehicle when the ability to do so is materially impaired by the consumption of alcohol or other drugs, including prescription medications.<ref>{{cite web|title=Drunken / Impaired Driving|url=http://www.ncsl.org/research/transportation/drunken-impaired-driving.aspx|website=NCSL|publisher=National Conference of State Legislatures|access-date=30 October 2017}}</ref> For impaired driving charges involving the consumption of alcohol, the blood alcohol level at which impairment is presumed is 0.08, although it is possible to be convicted of impaired driving with a lower blood alcohol level.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=Drunk and Impaired Driving Offenses|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/drunk_driving/Drunk.html|website=ExpertLaw.com|access-date=30 October 2017|date=26 May 2016}}</ref>

For example, the state of California has two basic drunk driving laws with nearly identical criminal penalties:<ref>{{cite web|title=California Vehicle Code, Sec. 23152|url=https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=VEH&sectionNum=23152|website=California Legislative Information|publisher=California State Legislature|access-date=1 August 2017}}</ref>
* V.C. Sec. 23152(a) - it is a misdemeanor to drive under the influence of alcohol or other drugs.
* V.C. Sec. 23152(b) - it is a misdemeanor to drive with .08% or more of alcohol in one's blood.
Under the first law, a driver may be convicted of impaired driving based upon their inability to safely operate a motor vehicle, no matter what their blood alcohol level. Under the second law, it is ''per se'' unlawful to drive with a blood alcohol level of .08 or greater.

For commercial drivers, a BAC of 0.04 can result in a DUI or DWI charge. In most states, individuals under 21 years of age are subject to a zero tolerance limit and even a small amount of alcohol can lead to a DUI arrest.

In some states, an intoxicated person may be convicted of a DUI in a parked car if the  individual is sitting behind the wheel of the car.<ref>{{cite web|title=Sleeping while drunk in the driver's seat of a parked car with the engine running is driving under the influence, and you really should have known that|url=http://www.pdsdc.org/professional-resources/criminal-law-blog/criminal-law-post/pds-criminal-law-blog/2015/01/27/sleeping-while-drunk-in-the-driver-s-seat-of-a-parked-car-with-the-engine-running-is-driving-under-the-influence-and-you-really-should-have-known-that|publisher=Public Defender Service for the District of Columbia|access-date=14 December 2017|date=22 January 2015}}</ref> In some jurisdictions, the occupant of a vehicle might be charged with impaired driving even if sleeping in the back seat based on proof of risk that the occupant would put the vehicle in motion while intoxicated.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Sarantis|first1=Theo|title=Drunk in the Backseat of a Car?

Some states allow for conviction for impaired driving based upon a measurement of [[THC]], through blood test or urine testing. For example, in [[Colorado]] and [[Washington (state)|Washington]], driving with a blood level of THC in excess of 5 nanograms can result in a DUI conviction. In Nevada, the legal THC limit is 2 nanograms. It is also possible for a driver to be convicted of impaired driving based upon the officer's observations of impairment, even if the driver is under the legal limit. In states that have not yet established a THC blood level that triggers a presumption of impaired driving, a driver may similarly be convicted of impaired driving based upon the officer's observations and performance on other sobriety tests.<ref name="SF Chronicle THC driving">{{cite web |last1=Lyons |first1=Jenna |title=Some states put a THC limit on pot-smoking drivers — Here's why California doesn't |url=https://www.sfchronicle.com/news/article/Some-states-put-a-THC-limit-on-pot-smoking-12465013.php |website=San Francisco Chronicle |access-date=2 February 2019}}</ref><ref name="Business Journal THC driving">{{cite web |last1=Rahaim |first1=Nick |title=No chemical threshold to mark marijuana impairment for California drivers |url=https://www.northbaybusinessjournal.com/northbay/7849774-181/california-marijuana-thc-testing-threshhold |website=Business Journal |access-date=2 February 2019}}</ref> The minimum  legal alcohol age of 21 years old has saved hundreds of lives annually among young adults aged 18–20 years old.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Carpenter|first1=Christopher|last2=Dobkin|first2=Carlos|date=2011|title=The Minimum Legal Drinking Age and Public Health|journal=The Journal of Economic Perspectives : A Journal of the American Economic Association|volume=25|issue=2|pages=133–156|doi=10.1257/jep.25.2.133|issn=0895-3309|pmc=3182479|pmid=21595328}}</ref>

====Prevalence====
In the United States, local law enforcement agencies made 1,467,300 arrests nationwide for driving under the influence of alcohol in 1996, compared to 1.9 million such arrests during the peak year in 1983.<ref>[http://bjs.ojp.usdoj.gov/content/pub/press/AC.PR Four in Ten Criminal Offenders Report Alcohol as a Factor in Violence: But Alcohol-Related Deaths and Consumption in Decline] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110118015505/http://bjs.ojp.usdoj.gov/content/pub/press/AC.PR |date=2011-01-18 }}, April 5, 1998, [[United States Bureau of Justice Statistics]].</ref> In 1997 an estimated 513,200 DWI offenders were in [[prison]] or [[jail]], down from 593,000 in 1990 and up from 270,100 in 1986.<ref>[http://bjs.ojp.usdoj.gov/content/pub/pdf/dwiocs.pdf DWI Offenders under Correctional Supervision] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811211519/http://bjs.ojp.usdoj.gov/content/pub/pdf/dwiocs.pdf |date=2011-08-11 }}, June 1999, [[United States Bureau of Justice Statistics]].</ref> In the United States, DUI and alcohol-related collisions produce an estimated $45 billion in damages every year.<ref>{{cite web|title=Impaired Driving: Get the Facts|url=https://www.cdc.gov/motorvehiclesafety/impaired_driving/impaired-drv_factsheet.html|website=CDC|access-date=1 August 2017|date=16 June 2017}}</ref>

====Implied consent====

All U.S. states recognize "[[Implied consent#Driving while intoxicated|implied consent]]", pursuant to which drivers are deemed to have consented to being tested for intoxication as a condition of their operating motor vehicles on public roadways.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Soronen|first1=Lisa|title=Blood Alcohol Testing: No Consent, No Warrant, No Crime?|url=http://www.ncsl.org/blog/2016/01/12/blood-alcohol-testing-no-consent-no-warrant-no-crime.aspx|website=NCSL|publisher=National Conference of State Legislatures|access-date=30 October 2017}}</ref> Implied consent laws may result in punishment for those who refuse to cooperate with blood alcohol testing after an arrest for suspected impaired driving, including civil consequences such as a driver's license suspension.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=Blood Alcohol Testing in Drunk and Impaired Driving Cases|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/drunk_driving/Drunk_Blood_Alcohol.html|website=ExpertLaw.com|access-date=30 October 2017|date=23 August 2016}}</ref> The State of Kansas found unconstitutional a state law that made it an additional crime to refuse such a test when no court-ordered warrant for testing exists.<ref>{{Cite web

Under the implied consent law of the State of Michigan, a person who is arrested for drunk driving is required to take a chemical test to determine their blood alcohol content, and refusal will result in six points being added to their driver's license and their driving privileges will be suspended for one year.<ref>{{cite web |title=Michigan's Law |url=https://www.michigan.gov/sos/0,4670,7-127-1627_8665_9070-21485--,00.html |website=Michigan.gov |access-date=16 August 2019}}</ref>

==Employment policies==
Many employers or occupations have their own rules and BAC limits; for example, the [[United States Federal Railroad Administration]] and [[Federal Aviation Administration]] have a 0.04% limit for train crew and aircrew, respectively.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fra.dot.gov/Elib/Document/1434|title=Alcohol and Drug Testing Regulations (Parts 219 and 40) Interpretive Guidance Manual|format=PDF|access-date=2015-01-06}}</ref> Certain large corporations have their own rules; for example, [[Union Pacific Railroad]] has their own BAC limit of 0.02%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ble-t.com/resc/drug%20and%20alchohol.pdf|title=UNION PACIFIC RAILROAD DRUG AND ALCOHOL POLICY Effective October 1, 2013 (see section 5.1.2)|access-date=2018-07-03}}</ref> that, if violated during a random test or a for-cause test—for example, after an on-duty traffic accident—can result in termination of employment with no chance of future rehire.
