[[File:International Criminal Court Headquarters, Netherlands.jpg|thumb|265px|The premises of the International Criminal Court in The Hague, Netherlands. The ICC moved into this building in December 2015]]

The '''International Criminal Court''' ('''ICC''' or '''ICCt''')<ref>International Criminal Court is sometimes abbreviated as ICCt to distinguish it from several other organisations abbreviated as ICC. However, the more common abbreviation ICC is used in this article.</ref> is an [[intergovernmental organization]] and [[International court|international tribunal]] that sits in [[The Hague]], [[Netherlands]]. The ICC is the first and only permanent international court with [[jurisdiction]] to prosecute [[individual]]s for the [[International criminal law|international crimes]] of [[genocide]], [[crimes against humanity]], [[war crime]]s, and [[Crime of aggression|the crime of aggression]]. It is intended to complement existing national [[judicial system]]s and it may therefore exercise its jurisdiction only when national courts are unwilling or unable to prosecute criminals. The ICC lacks universal territorial jurisdiction, and may only investigate and prosecute crimes committed within member states, crimes committed by nationals of member states, or crimes in situations referred to the Court by the [[United Nations Security Council]].

The ICC began operations on 1 July 2002, upon the entry into force of the [[Rome Statute]], a [[multilateral treaty]] that serves as the court's foundational and governing document. States which become party to the Rome Statute become members of the ICC, serving on the Assembly of States Parties, which administers the court. As of November 2019, there are [[States parties to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court|123 ICC member states]]; 42 states have neither signed nor become parties to the Rome Statute.

The ICC has four principal organs: the Presidency, the Judicial Divisions, the Office of the Prosecutor, and the Registry. The President is the most senior judge chosen by his or her peers in the Judicial Division, which hears cases before the Court. The Office of the Prosecutor is headed by the Prosecutor who investigates crimes and initiates criminal proceedings before the Judicial Division. The Registry is headed by the Registrar and is charged with managing all the administrative functions of the ICC, including the headquarters, detention unit, and public defense office.

The Office of the Prosecutor has opened 12 [[International Criminal Court investigations|official investigations]] and is also conducting an additional nine preliminary examinations. Thus far, [[List of people indicted in the International Criminal Court|45 individuals]] have been indicted in the ICC, including Ugandan rebel leader [[Joseph Kony]], former Sudanese president [[Omar al-Bashir]], Kenyan president [[Uhuru Kenyatta]], Libyan leader [[Muammar Gaddafi]], Ivorian president [[Laurent Gbagbo]], and DR Congo vice-president [[Jean-Pierre Bemba]].

The ICC has faced [[#Criticisms|a number of criticisms]] from states and society, including objections about its jurisdiction, accusations of bias, questioning of the fairness of its case-selection and trial procedures, and doubts about its effectiveness.

== History ==
The establishment of an [[International court|international tribunal]] to judge political leaders accused of international crimes was first proposed during the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]] in 1919 following the [[World War I|First World War]] by the [[Commission of Responsibilities]].<ref>"Commission on the Responsibility of the Authors of the War and on Enforcement of Penalties." ''The American Journal of International Law'' 14, no. 1/2 (1920): 95-154. doi:10.2307/2187841.</ref> The issue was addressed again at a conference held in [[Geneva]] under the auspices of the [[League of Nations]] in 1937, which resulted in the conclusion of the first convention stipulating the establishment of a permanent international court to try acts of international terrorism. The convention was signed by 13 states, but none ratified it and the convention never entered into force.

Following the [[World War II|Second World War]], the [[Allies of World War II|allied powers]] established two ''[[ad hoc]]'' tribunals to prosecute [[Axis powers|Axis]] leaders accused of war crimes. The [[Nuremberg trials|International Military Tribunal]], which sat in [[Nuremberg]], prosecuted German leaders while the [[International Military Tribunal for the Far East]] in [[Tokyo]] prosecuted Japanese leaders. In 1948 the [[United Nations General Assembly]] first recognised the need for a permanent international court to deal with atrocities of the kind prosecuted after the Second World War.<ref name="iccfact">

[[Benjamin B. Ferencz]], an investigator of [[Nazi war crime]]s after the [[World War II|Second World War]], and the Chief Prosecutor for the United States Army at the [[Einsatzgruppen Trial]], became a vocal advocate of the establishment of international [[rule of law]] and of an international criminal court. In his first book published in 1975, entitled ''Defining International Aggression: The Search for World Peace'', he advocated for the establishment of such a court.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.benferencz.org/bio.html |title=Benjamin B Ferencz, Biography  |date=9 January 2008 |access-date=1 March 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080109011136/http://www.benferencz.org/bio.html |archive-date=9 January 2008}}</ref> A second major advocate was [[Robert Kurt Woetzel]], who co-edited ''Toward a Feasible International Criminal Court'' in 1970 and created the Foundation for the Establishment of an International Criminal Court in 1971.

=== Towards a permanent international criminal court ===
In June 1989 [[Prime Minister of Trinidad and Tobago]], [[A. N. R. Robinson]] revived the idea of a permanent international criminal court by proposing the creation of such a court to deal with the [[illegal drug trade]].<ref name="Cato" /><ref>International Criminal Court (20 June 2006). {{cite web|url=http://www.icc-cpi.int/pressrelease_details%26id%3D152%26l%3Den.html |title=Election of Mr Arthur N.R.

</ref> While work began on the draft, the [[United Nations Security Council]] established two ''ad hoc'' tribunals in the early 1990s: The [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]], created in 1993 in response to large-scale atrocities committed by armed forces during [[Yugoslav Wars]], and the [[International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda]], created in 1994 following the [[Rwandan genocide]]. The creation of these tribunals further highlighted to many the need for a permanent international criminal court.<ref>

In 1994, the ILC presented its final draft statute for the International Criminal Court to the General Assembly and recommended that a conference be convened to negotiate a treaty that would serve as the Court's statute.<ref>
[http://legal.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/draft%20articles/7_4_1994.pdf "Draft Statute for an International Criminal Court, 1994"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019222229/http://legal.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/draft%20articles/7_4_1994.pdf |date=19 October 2013 }}. Retrieved 4 June 2012.
</ref> To consider major substantive issues in the draft statute, the General Assembly established the Ad Hoc Committee on the Establishment of an International Criminal Court, which met twice in 1995. After considering the Committee's report, the General Assembly created the Preparatory Committee on the Establishment of the ICC to prepare a consolidated draft text. From 1996 to 1998, six sessions of the Preparatory Committee were held at the [[Headquarters of the United Nations|United Nations headquarters]] in [[New York City]], during which NGOs provided input and attended meetings under the umbrella organisation of the [[Coalition for the International Criminal Court]] (CICC). In January 1998, the Bureau and coordinators of the Preparatory Committee convened for an Inter-Sessional meeting in [[Zutphen]] in the Netherlands to technically consolidate and restructure the draft articles into a draft.

Finally the General Assembly convened a conference in Rome in June 1998, with the aim of finalizing the treaty to serve as the Court's statute. On 17 July 1998, the [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court]] was adopted by a vote of 120 to seven, with 21 countries abstaining. The seven countries that voted against the treaty were [[China]], [[Iraq]], [[Israel]], [[Libya]], [[Qatar]], the [[United States]], and [[Yemen]].<ref>

It fails to comprehend why it has been considered necessary to insert into the list of the most heinous and grievous war crimes the action of transferring population into occupied territory. The exigencies of lack of time and intense political and public pressure have obliged the Conference to by-pass very basic sovereign prerogatives to which we are entitled in drafting international conventions, in favour of finishing the work and achieving a Statute on a come-what-may basis. We continue to hope that the Court will indeed serve the lofty objectives for the attainment of which it is being established."

=== Opposition to the Court ===
During the administration of [[Barack Obama]], US opposition to the ICC evolved to "positive engagement," although no effort was made to ratify the Rome Statute.<ref>

</ref> The current administration of [[Donald Trump]] is considerably more hostile to the Court, threatening prosecutions and financial sanctions on ICC judges and staff in US courts as well as imposing visa bans in response to any investigation against American nationals in connection to alleged crimes and atrocities perpetrated by the US in Afghanistan.

== Jurisdiction and admissibility ==
<!-- [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court]] and [[Complaints to the International Criminal Court]] link to this section -->

The Rome Statute requires that several criteria exist in a particular case before an individual can be prosecuted by the Court. The Statute contains three jurisdictional requirements and three admissibility requirements. All criteria must be met for a case to proceed.  The three jurisdictional requirements are (1) subject-matter jurisdiction (what acts constitute crimes), (2) territorial or personal jurisdiction (where the crimes were committed or who committed them), and (3) temporal jurisdiction (when the crimes were committed).

===Process===

The process to establish the Court's jurisdiction may be "triggered" by any one of three possible sources: (1) a State party, (2) the Security Council or (3) a Prosecutor. It is then up to the Prosecutor acting ''ex proprio motu'' ("of his own motion" so to speak) to initiate an investigation under the requirements of [[Article 15 of the Rome Statute]]. The procedure is slightly different when referred by a State Party or the Security Council, in which cases the Prosecutor does not need authorization of the [[Pre-Trial Chamber]] to initiate the investigation. Where there is a reasonable basis to proceed, it is mandatory for the Prosecutor to initiate an investigation. The factors listed in Article 53 considered for reasonable basis include whether the case would be admissible, and whether there are substantial reasons to believe that an investigation would not serve the interests of justice (the latter stipulates balancing against the gravity of the crime and the interests of the victims).<ref>{{cite book |last=Schabas |first=William A. |title=Introduction to The International Criminal Court}}</ref>

=== {{Anchor|Subject-matter jurisdiction}}Subject-matter jurisdiction requirements ===
The Court's subject-matter jurisdiction means the crimes for which individuals can be prosecuted. Individuals can only be prosecuted for crimes that are listed in the Statute. The primary crimes are listed in article 5 of the Statute and defined in later articles: [[genocide]] (defined in article 6), [[Crime against humanity|crimes against humanity]] (defined in article 7), [[war crime]]s (defined in article 8), and [[Crime of aggression|crimes of aggression]] (defined in article 8 ''bis'') (which is not yet within the jurisdiction of the Court; see below).<ref>Rome Statute, Article 5.</ref> In addition, article 70 defines ''offences against the administration of justice'', which is a fifth category of crime for which individuals can be prosecuted.

Article 6 defines the crime of genocide as "acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group".<ref>Rome Statute, Article 6.</ref> There are five such acts which constitute crimes of genocide under article 6:<ref>Rome Statute, Articles 6(a)–6(e).</ref>
# Killing members of a group
# Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group
# Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction
# Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group
# Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group
The definition of these crimes is identical to those contained within the [[Genocide Convention|Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide]] of 1948.

==== War crimes ====
Article 8 defines war crimes depending on whether an armed conflict is either international (which generally means it is fought between states) or non-international (which generally means that it is fought between non-state actors, such as rebel groups, or between a state and such non-state actors). In total there are 74 war crimes listed in article 8.<ref name="Elements of Crimes"/> The most serious crimes, however, are those that constitute either grave breaches of the [[Geneva Conventions]] of 1949, which only apply to international conflicts,<ref name="Elements of Crimes"/> and serious violations of article 3 common to the Geneva Conventions of 1949, which apply to non-international conflicts.<ref>Rome Statute, Article 8(2)(c).</ref>

There are 11 crimes which constitute grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions and which are applicable only to international armed conflicts:<ref name="Elements of Crimes"/>
# Willful killing
# Torture
# Inhumane treatment
# Biological experiments
# Willfully causing great suffering
# Destruction and appropriation of property
# Compelling service in hostile forces
# Denying a fair trial
# Unlawful deportation and transfer
# Unlawful confinement
# Taking hostages

There are seven crimes which constitute serious violations of article 3 common to the Geneva Conventions and which are applicable only to non-international armed conflicts:<ref name="Elements of Crimes"/>
# Murder
# Mutilation
# Cruel treatment
# Torture
# Outrages upon personal dignity
# Taking hostages
# Sentencing or execution without due process

Additionally, there are 56 other crimes defined by article 8: 35 that apply to international armed conflicts and 21 that apply to non-international armed conflicts.<ref name="Elements of Crimes"/> Such crimes include attacking civilians or civilian objects, attacking peacekeepers, causing excessive incidental death or damage, transferring populations into occupied territories, treacherously killing or wounding, denying quarter, pillaging, employing poison, using expanding bullets, rape and other forms of sexual violence, and conscripting or using child soldiers.<ref>Rome Statute, Article 8.</ref>

==== Crimes of aggression ====
Article 8 ''bis'' defines [[crimes of aggression]]. The Statute originally provided that the Court could not exercise its jurisdiction over the crime of aggression until such time as the states parties agreed on a definition of the crime and set out the conditions under which it could be prosecuted.<ref name="iccfact" /><ref name="article5">
Article 5 of the [http://legal.un.org/icc/statute/99_corr/cstatute.htm Rome Statute] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019222421/http://legal.un.org/icc/statute/99_corr/cstatute.htm |date=19 October 2013 }}. Retrieved 20 March 2008.
</ref> Such an amendment was adopted at the first review conference of the ICC in Kampala, Uganda, in June 2010. However, this amendment specified that the ICC would not be allowed to exercise jurisdiction of the crime of aggression until two further conditions had been satisfied: (1) the amendment has entered into force for 30 states parties and (2) on or after 1 January 2017, the Assembly of States Parties has voted in favor of allowing the Court to exercise jurisdiction. On 26 June 2016 the first condition was satisfied<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&mtdsg_no=XVIII-10-b&chapter=18&clang=_en#1|title=United Nations Treaty Collection|website=treaties.un.org|language=EN|access-date=20 March 2020}}</ref> and the state parties voted in favor of allowing the Court to exercise jurisdiction on 14 December 2017.<ref name="asp.icc-cpi.int">{{Cite web|url=https://asp.icc-cpi.int/en_menus/asp/crime%20of%20aggression/Pages/default.aspx|title=Crime of Aggression - Amendments Ratification|website=asp.icc-cpi.int|access-date=20 March 2020}}</ref> The Court's jurisdiction to prosecute crimes of aggression was accordingly activated on 17 July 2018.<ref name="asp.icc-cpi.int"/>

The Statute, as amended, defines the crime of aggression as "the planning, preparation, initiation or execution, by a person in a position effectively to exercise control over or to direct the political or military action of a State, of an act of aggression which, by its character, gravity and scale, constitutes a manifest violation of the [[United Nations Charter|Charter of the United Nations]]."<ref>Rome Statute, Article 8&nbsp;''bis''(1).</ref> The Statute defines an "act of aggression" as "the use of armed force by a State against the sovereignty, territorial integrity or political independence of another State, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Charter of the United Nations."<ref>Rome Statute, Article 8&nbsp;''bis''(2).</ref> The article also contains a list of seven acts of aggression, which are identical to those in [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 3314]] of 1974 and include the following acts when committed by one state against another state:<ref>Rome Statute, Articles 8&nbsp;''bis''(2)(a)–8&nbsp;''bis''(2)(g).</ref>

# Invasion or attack by armed forces against territory
# [[Military occupation]] of territory
# [[Annexation]] of territory
# [[Bombardment]] against territory
# Use of any weapons against territory
# [[Blockade]] of ports or coasts
# Attack on the land, sea, or air forces or marine and air fleets
# The use of armed forces which are within the territory of another state by agreement, but in contravention of the conditions of the agreement
# Allowing territory to be used by another state to perpetrate an act of aggression against a third state
# Sending armed bands, groups, [[Irregular military|irregulars]], or [[Mercenary|mercenaries]] to carry out acts of armed force

==== Offences against the administration of justice ====
Article 70 criminalizes certain intentional acts which interfere with investigations and proceedings before the Court, including giving false testimony, presenting false evidence, corruptly influencing a witness or official of the Court, retaliating against an official of the Court, and soliciting or accepting bribes as an official of the Court.<ref>Rome Statute, Article 70.</ref>

=== {{Anchor|Territorial or personal jurisdiction}}Territorial or personal jurisdiction requirements ===
For an individual to be prosecuted by the Court either territorial jurisdiction or personal jurisdiction must exist. Therefore, an individual can only be prosecuted if he or she has either (1) committed a crime within the territorial jurisdiction of the Court or (2) committed a crime while being a national of a state that is within the territorial jurisdiction of the Court.

==== Territorial jurisdiction ====
The [[territorial jurisdiction]] of the Court includes the territory, registered vessels, and registered aircraft of states which have either (1) become party to the Rome Statute or (2) accepted the Court's jurisdiction by filing a declaration with the Court.<ref name="Rome Statute, Article 12">Rome Statute, Article 12.</ref>

In situations that are referred to the Court by the United Nations Security Council, the territorial jurisdiction is defined by the Security Council, which may be more expansive than the Court's normal territorial jurisdiction.<ref name="Rome Statute, Article 13b">Rome Statute, Article 13(b).</ref> For example, if the Security Council refers a situation that took place in the territory of a state that has both not become party to the Rome Statute and not lodged a declaration with the Court, the Court will still be able to prosecute crimes that occurred within that state.

==== Personal jurisdiction ====
The personal jurisdiction of the Court extends to all natural persons who commit crimes, regardless of where they are located or where the crimes were committed, as long as those individuals are nationals of either (1) states that are party to the Rome Statute or (2) states that have accepted the Court's jurisdiction by filing a declaration with the Court.<ref name="Rome Statute, Article 12"/> As with territorial jurisdiction, the personal jurisdiction can be expanded by the Security Council if it refers a situation to the Court.<ref name="Rome Statute, Article 13b"/>

=== {{Anchor|Temporal jurisdiction}}Temporal jurisdiction requirements ===
Temporal jurisdiction is the time period over which the Court can exercise its powers. No statute of limitations applies to any of the crimes defined in the Statute.<ref>Rome Statute, Article 29.</ref> However, the Court's jurisdiction is not completely retroactive. Individuals can only be prosecuted for crimes that took place on or after 1 July 2002, which is the date that the Rome Statute entered into force.<ref>Rome Statute, Article 11(1).</ref> If a state became party to the Statute, and therefore a member of the Court, after 1 July 2002, then the Court cannot exercise jurisdiction prior to the membership date for certain cases.<ref>Rome Statute, Article 11(2).</ref> For example, if the Statute entered into force for a state on 1 January 2003, the Court could only exercise temporal jurisdiction over crimes that took place in that state or were committed by a national of that state on or after 1 January 2003.

=== {{Anchor|Admissibility}}Admissibility requirements ===
To initiate an investigation, the Prosecutor must (1) have a "reasonable basis to believe that a crime within the jurisdiction of the Court has been or is being committed", (2) the investigation would be consistent with the principle of complementarity, and (3) the investigation serves the interests of justice.<ref>Rome Statute, Article 53(1).</ref>

==== Complementarity ====
The principle of complementarity means that the Court will only prosecute an individual if states are unwilling or unable to prosecute. Therefore, if legitimate national investigations or proceedings into crimes have taken place or are ongoing, the Court will not initiate proceedings. This principle applies regardless of the outcome of national proceedings.<ref name="ReferenceA">Rome Statute, Articles 17(a)–17(c).</ref> Even if an investigation is closed without any criminal charges being filed or if an accused person is acquitted by a national court, the Court will not prosecute an individual for the crime in question so long as it is satisfied that the national proceedings were legitimate. However, the actual application of the complementarity principle has recently come under theoretical scrutiny.<ref>

</ref><ref name="ReferenceA"/>

==== Gravity ====
The Court will only initiate proceedings if a crime is of "sufficient gravity to justify further action by the Court".<ref>Rome Statute, Articles 17(d).</ref>

==== Interests of justice ====
The Prosecutor will initiate an investigation unless there are "substantial reasons to believe that an investigation would not serve the interests of justice" when "[t]aking into account the gravity of the crime and the interests of victims".<ref>Rome Statute, Article 53(1)(c).</ref> Furthermore, even if an investigation has been initiated and there are substantial facts to warrant a prosecution and no other admissibility issues, the Prosecutor must determine whether a prosecution would serve the interests of justice "taking into account all the circumstances, including the gravity of the crime, the interests of victims and the age or infirmity of the alleged perpetrator, and his or her role in the alleged crime".<ref>Rome Statute, Article 53(2)(c).</ref>

===Victim participation===
One of the great innovations of the Statute of the International Criminal Court and its Rules of Procedure and Evidence is the series of rights granted to victims.<ref>International Criminal Court. {{cite web|url=http://www.icc-cpi.int/victimsissues.html |title=''Victims and witnesses'' |access-date=29 June 2006 |url-status=bot: unknown |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070702033823/http://www.icc-cpi.int/victimsissues.html |archive-date=2 July 2007  }}.

Accessed 24 July 2007.
</ref> For the first time in the history of international criminal justice, victims have the possibility under the Statute to present their views and observations before the Court.

Participation before the Court may occur at various stages of proceedings and may take different forms, although it will be up to the judges to give directions as to the timing and manner of participation.

Participation in the Court's proceedings will in most cases take place through a legal representative and will be conducted "in a manner which is not prejudicial or inconsistent with the rights of the accused and a fair and impartial trial".

The victim-based provisions within the Rome Statute provide victims with the opportunity to have their voices heard and to obtain, where appropriate, some form of reparation for their suffering. It is the aim of this attempted balance between [[Retributive justice|retributive]] and [[restorative justice]] that, it is hoped, will enable the ICC to not only bring criminals to justice but also help the victims themselves obtain some form of justice. Justice for victims before the ICC comprises both procedural and substantive justice, by allowing them to participate and present their views and interests, so that they can help to shape truth, justice and reparations outcomes of the Court.<ref>

It is sometimes argued that amnesties are necessary to allow the [[peaceful transition of power|peaceful transfer of power]] from abusive regimes. By denying states the right to offer amnesty to human rights abusers, the International Criminal Court may make it more difficult to negotiate an end to conflict and a transition to democracy.

==Relationships==

===United Nations===
[[File:Darfur report - Page 2 Image 1.jpg|thumb|left|The [[United Nations Security Council|UN Security Council]] referred the [[War in Darfur|situation in Darfur]] to the ICC in 2005]]
Unlike the [[International Court of Justice]], the ICC is legally independent from the United Nations. However, the Rome Statute grants certain powers to the [[United Nations Security Council]], which limits its functional independence. Article 13 allows the Security Council to refer to the Court situations that would not otherwise fall under the Court's jurisdiction (as it did in relation to the situations in Darfur and Libya, which the Court could not otherwise have prosecuted as neither Sudan nor Libya are state parties). Article 16 allows the Security Council to require the Court to defer from investigating a case for a period of 12 months.<ref name="Article 16">
Article 16 of the [http://legal.un.org/icc/statute/99_corr/cstatute.htm Rome Statute] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019222421/http://legal.un.org/icc/statute/99_corr/cstatute.htm |date=19 October 2013 }}. Accessed 20 March 2008.
</ref> Such a deferral may be renewed indefinitely by the Security Council. This sort of an arrangement gives the ICC some of the advantages inhering in the organs of the United Nations such as using the enforcement powers of the Security Council, but it also creates a risk of being tainted with the political controversies of the Security Council.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.americanstudents.us/Eyes7/Public/Eyes%20on%20the%20ICC%207.1%20full%20volume%20preview.pdf |title=Abadir M.

===Nongovernmental organizations===
During the 1970s and 1980s, international human rights and humanitarian Nongovernmental Organizations (or NGOs) began to proliferate at exponential rates. Concurrently, the quest to find a way to punish international crimes shifted from being the exclusive responsibility of legal experts to being shared with [[international human rights law|international human rights]] activism.

NGOs helped birth the ICC through advocacy and championing for the prosecution of perpetrators of crimes against humanity. NGOs closely monitor the organization's declarations and actions, ensuring that the work that is being executed on behalf of the ICC is fulfilling its objectives and responsibilities to civil society.<ref name="Schiff">{{cite book|last=Schiff|first=Benjamin|title=Building the International Criminal Court|year=2008|publisher=Cambridge University Press}}</ref> According to Benjamin Schiff, "From the Statute Conference onward, the relationship between the ICC and the NGOs has probably been closer, more consistent, and more vital to the Court than have analogous relations between NGOs and any other international organization."

There are a number of NGOs working on a variety of issues related to the ICC. The NGO [[Coalition for the International Criminal Court]] has served as a sort of umbrella for NGOs to coordinate with each other on similar objectives related to the ICC. The CICC has 2,500 member organizations in 150 different countries.<ref name="CICC">
{{cite web|title=About the Coalition|url=http://www.iccnow.org/?mod=coalition|publisher=Coalition for the International Criminal Court|access-date=28 April 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110520051604/http://www.iccnow.org/?mod=coalition|archive-date=20 May 2011|url-status=live}}
</ref> The original steering committee included representatives from the [[World Federalist Movement]], the [[International Commission of Jurists]], [[Amnesty International]], the [[Lawyers Committee for Human Rights]], [[Human Rights Watch]], [[Parliamentarians for Global Action]], and [[No Peace Without Justice]].<ref name="Schiff"/> Today, many of the NGOs with which the ICC cooperates are members of the CICC. These organizations come from a range of backgrounds, spanning from major international NGOs such as [[Human Rights Watch]] and [[Amnesty International]], to smaller, more local organizations focused on peace and justice missions.<ref name="Schiff"/> Many work closely with states, such as the International Criminal Law Network, founded and predominantly funded by [[the Hague]] municipality and the Dutch Ministries of Defense and Foreign Affairs. The CICC also claims organizations that are themselves federations, such as the [[International Federation of Human Rights Leagues]] (FIDH).

CICC members ascribe to three principles that permit them to work under the umbrella of the CICC, so long as their objectives match them:
*Promoting worldwide ratification and implementation of the Rome Statute of the ICC
*Maintaining the integrity of the Rome Statute of the ICC, and
*Ensuring the ICC will be as fair, effective and independent as possible<ref name="CICC"/>

The NGOs that work under the CICC do not normally pursue agendas exclusive to the work of the Court, rather they may work for broader causes, such as general human rights issues, victims' rights, gender rights, rule of law, conflict mediation, and peace.<ref name="Schiff"/> The CICC coordinates their efforts to improve the efficiency of NGOs' contributions to the Court and to pool their influence on major common issues. From the ICC side, it has been useful to have the CICC channel NGO contacts with the Court so that its officials do not have to interact individually with thousands of separate organizations.

NGOs have been crucial to the evolution of the ICC, as they assisted in the creation of the normative climate that urged states to seriously consider the Court's formation. Their legal experts helped shape the Statute, while their lobbying efforts built support for it. They advocate Statute ratification globally and work at expert and political levels within member states for passage of necessary domestic legislation. NGOs are greatly represented at meetings for the [[#Assembly of States Parties|Assembly of States Parties]], and they use the ASP meetings to press for decisions promoting their priorities.<ref name="Schiff"/> Many of these NGOs have reasonable access to important officials at the ICC because of their involvement during the Statute process. They are engaged in monitoring, commenting upon, and assisting in the ICC's activities.

The ICC often depends on NGOs to interact with local populations. The Registry Public Information Office personnel and Victims Participation and Reparations Section officials hold seminars for local leaders, professionals and the media to spread the word about the Court.<ref name="Schiff"/> These are the kinds of events that are often hosted or organized by local NGOs. Because there can be challenges with determining which of these NGOs are legitimate, CICC regional representatives often have the ability to help screen and identify trustworthy organizations.

However, NGOs are also "sources of criticism, exhortation and pressure upon" the ICC.<ref name="Schiff"/> The ICC heavily depends on NGOs for its operations. Although NGOs and states cannot directly impact the judicial nucleus of the organization, they can impart information on crimes, can help locate victims and witnesses, and can promote and organize victim participation. NGOs outwardly comment on the Court's operations, "push for expansion of its activities especially in the new justice areas of outreach in conflict areas, in victims' participation and reparations, and in upholding due-process standards and defense 'equality of arms' and so implicitly set an agenda for the future evolution of the ICC."<ref name="Schiff"/> The relatively uninterrupted progression of NGO involvement with the ICC may mean that NGOs have become repositories of more institutional historical knowledge about the ICC than its national representatives, and have greater expertise than some of the organization's employees themselves. While NGOs look to mold the ICC to satisfy the interests and priorities that they have worked for since the early 1990s, they unavoidably press against the limits imposed upon the ICC by the states that are members of the organization. NGOs can pursue their own mandates, irrespective of whether they are compatible with those of other NGOs, while the ICC must respond to the complexities of its own mandate as well as those of the states and NGOs.

Another issue has been that NGOs possess "exaggerated senses of their ownership over the organization and, having been vital to and successful in promoting the Court, were not managing to redefine their roles to permit the Court its necessary independence."<ref name="Schiff"/> Additionally, because there does exist such a gap between the large human rights organizations and the smaller peace-oriented organizations, it is difficult for ICC officials to manage and gratify all of their NGOs. "ICC officials recognize that the NGOs pursue their own agendas, and that they will seek to pressure the ICC in the direction of their own priorities rather than necessarily understanding or being fully sympathetic to the myriad constraints and pressures under which the Court operates."<ref name="Schiff"/> Both the ICC and the NGO community avoid criticizing each other publicly or vehemently, although NGOs have released advisory and cautionary messages regarding the ICC. They avoid taking stances that could potentially give the Court's adversaries, particularly the US, more motive to berate the organization.

==Criticisms==

===African accusations of Western imperialism===
The ICC has been accused of bias and as being a tool of Western [[imperialism]], only punishing leaders from small, weak states while ignoring crimes committed by richer and more powerful states.<ref>

The prosecution of Kenyan Deputy President [[William Ruto]] and President [[Uhuru Kenyatta]] (both charged before coming into office) led to the Kenyan parliament passing a motion calling for Kenya's withdrawal from the ICC, and the country called on the other 33 African states party to the ICC to withdraw their support, an issue which was discussed at a special [[African Union]] (AU) summit in October 2013.

Though the ICC has denied the charge of disproportionately targeting African leaders, and claims to stand up for victims wherever they may be, Kenya was not alone in criticising the ICC. Sudanese President [[Omar al-Bashir]] visited [[Kenya]], [[South Africa]], [[China]], [[Nigeria]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[United Arab Emirates]], [[Egypt]], [[Ethiopia]], [[Qatar]] and several other countries despite an outstanding ICC warrant for his arrest but was not arrested; he said that the charges against him are "exaggerated" and that the ICC was a part of a "[[Western world|Western]] plot" against him. Ivory Coast's government opted not to transfer former first lady [[Simone Gbagbo]] to the court but to instead try her at home. Rwanda's ambassador to the African Union, Joseph Nsengimana, argued that "It is not only the case of Kenya. We have seen international justice become more and more a political matter." Ugandan President [[Yoweri Museveni]] accused the ICC of "mishandling complex African issues." Ethiopian Prime Minister [[Hailemariam Desalegn]], at the time AU chairman, told the UN General Assembly at the [[General debate of the sixty-eighth session of the United Nations General Assembly]]: "The manner in which the ICC has been operating has left a very bad impression in Africa.

South African President [[Jacob Zuma]] said the perceptions of the ICC as "unreasonable" led to the calling of the special AU summit on 13 October 2015. Botswana is a notable supporter of the ICC in Africa.<ref>

On 7 October 2016, [[Burundi]] announced that it would leave the ICC, after the court began investigating political violence in that nation. In the subsequent two weeks, South Africa and Gambia also announced their intention to leave the court, with Kenya and Namibia reportedly also considering departure. All three nations cited the fact that all 39 people indicted by the court over its history have been African and that the court has made no effort to investigate war crimes tied to the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]].<ref>

===Criticism by the United States government ===
The [[United States Department of State]] argues that there are "insufficient checks and balances on the authority of the ICC prosecutor and judges" and "insufficient protection against politicized prosecutions or other abuses".<ref name="US DoS faq"/> The current law in the United States on the ICC is the [[American Service-Members' Protection Act]] (ASPA), 116 Stat. 820. The ASPA authorizes the President of the United States to use "all means necessary and appropriate to bring about the release of any U.S. or allied personnel being detained or imprisoned by, on behalf of, or at the request of the International Criminal Court." This authorization has led the act to be nicknamed the "Hague Invasion Act",<ref>
Human Rights Watch, "[https://www.hrw.org/en/news/2002/08/03/us-hague-invasion-act-becomes-law U.S.: 'Hague Invasion Act' Becomes Law] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150118203654/http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2002/08/03/us-hague-invasion-act-becomes-law |date=18 January 2015 }}". 3 August 2002.

On 10 September 2018, [[John R. Bolton]], in his first major address as U.S. [[National Security Advisor (United States)|National Security Advisor]], reiterated that the ICC lacks checks and balances, exercises "jurisdiction over crimes that have disputed and ambiguous definitions," and has failed to "deter and punish atrocity crimes." The ICC, said Bolton, is "superfluous" given that "domestic judicial systems already hold American citizens to the highest legal and ethical standards." He added that the U.S. would do everything "to protect our citizens" should the ICC attempt to prosecute U.S. servicemen over alleged [[Bagram torture and prisoner abuse|detainee abuse in Afghanistan]]. In that event, ICC judges and prosecutors would be barred from entering the U.S., their funds in the U.S. would be [[Sanctions (law)|sanctioned]] and the U.S. "will prosecute them in the US criminal system. We will do the same for any company or state that assists an ICC investigation of Americans", Bolton said. He also criticized [[Palestinian government|Palestinian]] efforts to bring [[Israel]] before the ICC over allegations of [[human rights]] abuses in the [[West Bank]] and [[Gaza Strip|Gaza]].<ref>

=== OPCD ===
Concerning the independent Office of Public Counsel for the Defence (OPCD), Thomas Lubanga's defence team say they were given a smaller budget than the Prosecutor and that evidence and witness statements were slow to arrive.<ref name="cfr"/>

===Limitations===
Limitations exist for the ICC. Human Rights Watch (HRW) reported that the ICC's prosecutor team takes no account of the roles played by the government in the conflict of Uganda, Rwanda or Congo. This led to a flawed investigation, because the ICC did not reach the conclusion of its verdict after considering the governments' position and actions in the conflict.<ref>

=== Unintentional consequences ===
Research suggests that prosecutions of leaders in the ICC makes dictators less likely to peacefully step down.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = The Role of Domestic Opposition and International Justice Regimes in Peaceful Transitions of Power|journal = Journal of Conflict Resolution|volume = 60|issue = 7|date = 12 February 2015|issn = 0022-0027|pages = 1191–1218|doi = 10.1177/0022002714567946|first1 = Monika|last1 = Nalepa|first2 = Emilia Justyna|last2 = Powell|s2cid = 147312685|author-link2 =Emilia Justyna Powell}}</ref> It is also argued that justice is a means to peace: "As a result, the ICC has been used as a means
of intervention in ongoing conflicts with the expectation that the indictments, arrests, and
trials of elite perpetrators have deterrence and preventive effects for atrocity crimes.
Despite these legitimate intentions and great expectations, there is little evidence of the
efficacy of justice as a means to peace".<ref>Alana Tiemessen, ''The International Criminal Court and the lawfare of judicial intervention'', International Relations Vol. 30, No. 4, December 2016.</ref>

=== State cooperation ===
That the ICC cannot mount successful cases without state cooperation is problematic for several reasons. It means that the ICC acts inconsistently in its selection of cases, is prevented from taking on hard cases and loses legitimacy.<ref name=":0">

</ref> It also gives the ICC less deterrent value, as potential perpetrators of war crimes know that they can avoid ICC judgment by taking over government and refusing to cooperate.<ref name=":0" />

=== Questioning the true application of the principle of complementarity ===
The fundamental principle of complementarity of the ICC Rome Statute is often taken for granted in the legal analysis of international criminal law and its jurisprudence. Initially the thorny issue of the actual application of the complementarity principle arose in 2008, when [[William Schabas]] published his influential paper.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.1007/s10609-007-9054-5|title = 'Complementarity in practice': Some uncomplimentary thoughts| journal=Criminal Law Forum| volume=19| pages=5–33|year = 2008|last1 = Schabas|first1 = William A.|s2cid = 144796686}}</ref> However, despite Schabas' theoretical impact, no substantive research was made by other scholars on this issue for quite some time. In June 2017, Victor Tsilonis advanced the same criticism which is reinforced by events, practices of the Office of the Prosecutor and ICC cases in the Essays in Honour of [[Nestor Courakis]]. His paper essentially argues that the Αl‐Senussi case arguably is the first instance of the complementarity principle's actual implementation eleven whole years after the ratification of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court.<ref>

On the other hand, the Chief Prosecutor, Fatou Bensouda, has invoked recently the principle of complementarity in the situation between Russia and Georgia in

Some advocates have suggested that the ICC go "beyond complementarity" and systematically support national capacity for prosecutions.<ref>Beyond Complementarity: The International Criminal Court and National Prosecutions, a View from Haiti, [[Brian Concannon]] 32 Columbia Human Rights Law Review 201 (2000) https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=271965</ref>  They argue that national prosecutions, where possible, are more cost-effective, preferable to victims and more sustainable.
