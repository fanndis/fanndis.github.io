ISIL aims to return to the early days of Islam, rejecting all [[Bid'ah|innovations]] in the religion, which it believes corrupts its original spirit. It condemns later caliphates and the [[Ottoman Empire]] for deviating from what it calls pure Islam and seeks to revive the original Wahhabi project of the restoration of the caliphate governed by strict Salafist doctrine. Following Salafi-Wahhabi tradition, ISIL condemns the followers of secular law as disbelievers, putting the current Saudi Arabian government in that category.{{r|Wahhabism}}

Salafists such as ISIL believe that only a legitimate authority can undertake the leadership of [[jihad]] and that the first priority over other areas of combat, such as fighting non-Muslim countries, is the purification of Islamic society. For example, ISIL regards the Palestinian Sunni group [[Hamas]] as apostates who have no legitimate authority to lead jihad and see fighting Hamas as the first step toward confrontation by ISIL with Israel.{{r|ISIS_NYT}}<ref>{{cite news |last1=Mamouri |first1=Ali |title=Why Islamic State has no sympathy for Hamas |url=http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2014/07/islamic-state-fighting-hamas-priority-before-israel.html |date=29 July 2014 |work=Al-Monitor |access-date=1 August 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140801134410/http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2014/07/islamic-state-fighting-hamas-priority-before-israel.html |archive-date=1 August 2014}}</ref>

=== Islamic eschatology ===
{{See also|Islamic eschatology}}
One difference between ISIL and other Islamist and jihadist movements, including [[al-Qaeda]], is the group's emphasis on [[Islamic eschatology|eschatology]] and [[apocalypticism]] – that is, a belief in a final [[Last Judgment#Islam|Day of Judgment]] by God. ISIL believes that it will defeat the army of "Rome" at the town of [[Dabiq, Syria|Dabiq]].{{r|what-isis-really-wants}} ISIL also believes that after al-Baghdadi there will be only four more legitimate caliphs.{{r|what-isis-really-wants}}

The noted scholar of militant Islamism [[Will McCants]] writes:

{{quote|text=References to the End Times fill Islamic State propaganda. It's a big selling point with foreign fighters, who want to travel to the lands where the final battles of the apocalypse will take place. The civil wars raging in those countries today [Iraq and Syria] lend credibility to the prophecies. The Islamic State has stoked the apocalyptic fire. [...] For Bin Laden's generation, the apocalypse wasn't a great recruiting pitch. Governments in the Middle East two decades ago were more stable, and sectarianism was more subdued. It was better to recruit by calling to arms against corruption and tyranny than against the Antichrist. Today, though, the apocalyptic recruiting pitch makes more sense than before. |author=William McCants |source=''The ISIS Apocalypse: The History, Strategy, and Doomsday Vision of the Islamic State''<ref>{{Cite book |title=The ISIS Apocalypse: The History, Strategy, and Doomsday Vision of the Islamic State |last=McCants |first=William |publisher=St. Martin's Press |year=2015 |isbn=978-1-250-08090-5 |location=New York |page=[https://archive.org/details/isisapocalypsehi0000mcca/page/147 147] |url=https://archive.org/details/isisapocalypsehi0000mcca/page/147}}</ref>}}

Documents found after the death of Samir Abd Muhammad al-Khlifawi, a former colonel in the intelligence service of the [[Iraqi Air Force]] before the US invasion who had been described as "the strategic head" of ISIL, detailed planning for the ISIL takeover of northern Syria which made possible "the group's later advances into Iraq". Al-Khlifawi called for the infiltration of areas to be conquered with spies who would find out "as much as possible about the target towns: Who lived there, who was in charge, which families were religious, which Islamic school of religious jurisprudence they belonged to, how many mosques there were, who the imam was, how many wives and children he had and how old they were". Following this surveillance and espionage would come murder and kidnapping – "the elimination of every person who might have been a potential leader or opponent". In Raqqa, after rebel forces drove out the Assad regime and ISIL infiltrated the town, "first dozens and then hundreds of people disappeared".<ref>{{cite news |last1=Reuter |first1=Christoph |date=18 April 2015 |title=The Terror Strategist: Secret Files Reveal the Structure of Islamic State |url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/islamic-state-files-show-structure-of-islamist-terror-group-a-1029274.html |work=Der Spiegel}}</ref>

==== Conventional weapons ====
ISIL relies mostly on captured weapons with major sources including [[Saddam Hussein]]'s Iraqi stockpiles from the [[Iraqi insurgency (2003–11)|2003–11 Iraq insurgency]]<ref>{{cite news |title=Insight into How Insurgents Fought in Iraq |url=http://atwar.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/10/17/insight-into-how-insurgents-fought-in-iraq/ |date=17 October 2013 |work=The New York Times |access-date=22 August 2014 |first=John |last=Ismay}}</ref> and weapons from government and opposition forces fighting in the [[Syrian Civil War]] and during the [[Iraqi insurgency (2011–present)|post-US withdrawal Iraqi insurgency]].

The group uses truck and [[car bomb]]s, [[suicide bombers]] and [[Improvised explosive device|IEDs]], and has used [[chemical weapon]]s in Iraq and Syria.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/Pages/sm103.aspx |publisher=[[United States Department of the Treasury]] |title=Treasury Targets ISIS Leader Involved in Chemical Weapons Development |date=12 June 2017 |quote=Al-Jaburi is an Iraq-based, ISIS senior leader in charge of factories producing improvised explosive devices (IEDs), vehicle-borne improvised explosive devices (VBIEDs), and explosives, and he is involved in the development of chemical weapons}}</ref> ISIL captured nuclear materials from [[Mosul University]] in July 2014, but is unlikely to be able to convert them into weapons.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Cowell |first1=Alan |title=Low-Grade Nuclear Material Is Seized by Rebels in Iraq, U.N.

The group closed the gates of the smaller Nuaimiyah dam in Fallujah in April 2014, flooding the surrounding regions, while cutting the water supply to the [[Shia]]-dominated south. Around 12,000 families lost their homes and {{convert|200|km2|mi2}} of villages and fields were either flooded or dried up. The economy of the region also suffered with destruction of cropland and electricity shortages.<ref>{{cite report |title=Water and Violence Link: Crisis of Survival in the Middle East |url=http://strategicforesight.com/publication_pdf/63948150123-web.pdf |publisher=Strategic Foresight |location=Mumbai, India |date=December 2014 |isbn=978-81-88262-24-3}}</ref>

=== Non-combatant recruits ===
Although ISIL attracts followers from different parts of the world by promoting the image of holy war, not all of its recruits end up in combatant roles. There have been several cases of new recruits expecting to be ''[[mujihadeen|mujahideen]]'' who have returned from Syria disappointed by the everyday jobs that were assigned to them.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}

=== Women ===
ISIL publishes material directed at women, with media groups encouraging them to play supportive roles within ISIL, such as providing first aid, cooking, nursing and sewing skills, in order to become [[Brides of ISIL|"good wives of jihad"]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/isis-now-targeting-women-with-guides-on-how-to-be-the-ultimate-wives-of-jihad-9830562.html |title=Isis now targeting women with guides on how to be the 'ultimate wives of jihad' |date=31 October 2014 |access-date=22 January 2015 |location=London |work=Independent |first=Heather |last=Saul}}</ref> In 2015, it was estimated that western women made up over 550, or 10%, of ISIL's western foreign fighters.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Perešin |first1=Anita |title=Fatal Attraction: Western Muslimas and ISIS |journal=Perspectives on Terrorism |date=2015 |volume=9 |issue=3 |page=22 |issn=2334-3745|quote=The exact number of Muslim women from the West who joined ISIS is still not officially confirmed.

Until 2016, women were generally confined to a "women's house" upon arrival which they were forbidden to leave. These houses were often small, dirty and infested with vermin and food supply was scarce. There they remained until they either had found a husband, or the husband they had arrived with had completed his training. After being allowed to leave the confinement, women still generally spent most of their days indoors where their lives are devoted to caring for their husbands and the vast majority of women in the conflict area have children. Mothers play an important role passing on ISIL ideology to their children. Widows are encouraged to remarry.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://english.aivd.nl/publications/publications/2017/12/14/publication-jihadist-women-a-threat-not-to-be-underestimated|title=Jihadist women, a threat not to be underestimated – Publication – pdf|last=Koninkrijksrelaties|first=Ministerie van Binnenlandse Zaken en|date=14 December 2017|publisher=[[AIVD]]|page=6|language=en-GB|access-date=1 December 2018}}</ref>

In a document entitled ''Women in the Islamic State: Manifesto and Case Study'' released by the media wing of ISIL's all-female [[Al-Khansaa Brigade|Al-Khanssaa Brigade]], emphasis is given to the paramount importance of marriage and motherhood (as early as nine years old).

{{Main|Use of social media by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant}}
ISIL's use of [[social media]] has been described by one expert as "probably more sophisticated than [that of] most US companies".{{r|ft-20140617}}<ref name="Atlantic socmedia">{{cite web |last=Berger |first=J.

The group is known for releasing videos and photographs of executions of prisoners, whether beheadings, shootings, caged prisoners being burnt alive or submerged gradually until drowned.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Lee |first1=Ian |last2=Hanna |first2=Jason |title=Croatian ISIS captive reportedly beheaded |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2015/08/12/middleeast/isis-croatian-hostage/ |access-date=12 August 2015 |publisher=CNN |date=12 August 2015}}</ref> Journalist [[Abdel Bari Atwan]] described ISIL's media content as part of a "systematically applied policy". The escalating violence of its killings "guarantees" the attention of the media and public.{{r|NYRoB-7-9-2015}}

Along with images of brutality, ISIL presents itself as "an emotionally attractive place where people 'belong', where everyone is a 'brother' or 'sister'". The "most potent psychological pitch" of ISIL media is the promise of heavenly reward to dead jihadist fighters. Frequently posted in their media are dead jihadists' smiling faces, the ISIL 'salute' of a 'right-hand index finger pointing heavenward', and testimonies of happy widows.{{r|NYRoB-7-9-2015}} ISIL has also attempted to present a more "rational argument" in a series of videos hosted by the kidnapped journalist [[John Cantlie]]. In one video, various current and former US officials were quoted, such as the then US President [[Barack Obama]] and former [[CIA]] Officer [[Michael Scheuer]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Walsh |first1=Michael |title=ISIS releases second 'lecture video' of British hostage John Cantlie |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/isis-releases-lecture-video-british-hostage-john-cantlie-article-1.1949195 |access-date=6 October 2014 |work=Daily News |location=New York |date=23 September 2014}}</ref>

{{Main|Finances of ISIL}}
{{See also|Oil production and smuggling in ISIL}}
According to a 2015 study by the [[Financial Action Task Force]], ISIL's five primary sources of revenue are as follows (listed in order of significance):
* proceeds from the occupation of territory (including control of banks, petroleum reservoirs, taxation, extortion, and robbery of economic assets)
* kidnapping for ransom<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-34312450 |title=Inside the Islamic State kidnap machine |date=22 September 2015 |work=BBC News|access-date=9 October 2016}}</ref>

Extremism within Islam goes back to the 7th century, to the [[Khawarij]]es. From their essentially political position, the Kharijites developed extreme doctrines which set them apart from both mainstream Sunni and Shia Muslims. They were particularly noted for adopting a radical approach to [[takfir]], whereby they declared other Muslims to be unbelievers and therefore deemed worthy of death.{{sfnp|Al-Yaqoubi|2015|pages=xvii–xviii}}<ref name=SheemaKhan>{{cite news |first=Sheema |last=Khan |date=29 September 2014 |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-debate/another-battle-with-islams-true-believers/article20802390/ |title=Another battle with Islam's 'true believers' |work=The Globe and Mail |location=Toronto, Canada}}<br>{{bullet}}{{cite report |first=Usama |last=Hasan |title=The Balance of Islam in Challenging Extremism |url=http://www.quilliamfoundation.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/publications/free/the-balance-of-islam-in-challenging-extremism.pdf |publisher=Quilliam Foundation |date=July 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140802045255/http://www.quilliamfoundation.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/publications/free/the-balance-of-islam-in-challenging-extremism.pdf |archive-date=2 August 2014}}<br>{{bullet}}{{cite news |url=https://ottawacitizen.com/news/national/fruits-of-the-tree-of-extremism |title=Imam Mohamad Jebara: Fruits of the tree of extremism |first=Mohamad |last=Jebara |work=Ottawa Citizen |date=6 February 2015}}</ref> Other scholars have also described the group not as Sunnis, but as Khawarij.{{r|SheemaKhan}}{{sfnp|Al-Yaqoubi|2015|pages=xvii–xviii, see also p.8}} Sunni critics, including [[Salafi movement|Salafi]] and jihadist [[muftis]] such as [[Adnan al-Aroor]] and [[Abu Basir al-Tartusi]], say that ISIL and related terrorist groups are not Sunnis, but are instead modern-day Kharijites (Muslims who have stepped outside the mainstream of Islam) serving an imperial anti-Islamic agenda.<ref name="econ140906">{{cite news |url=https://www.economist.com/news/middle-east-and-africa/21615634-sunni-religious-authorities-turn-against-islamic-state-slow-backlash |title=The slow backlash – Sunni religious authorities turn against Islamic State |date=6 September 2014 |newspaper=The Economist}}</ref>

ISIS has been [[takfir|excommunicated]] from Islam by a number of scholars.

An [[Islamic Front (Syria)|Islamic Front]] [[sharia]] court judge in Aleppo, Mohamed Najeeb Bannan, stated: "The legal reference is the Islamic Sharia. The cases are different, from robberies to drug use, to moral crimes. It's our duty to look at any crime that comes to us... After the regime has fallen, we believe that the Muslim majority in Syria will ask for an Islamic state. Of course, it's very important to point out that some say the Islamic Sharia will cut off people's hands and heads, but it only applies to criminals. And to start off by killing, crucifying etc. That is not correct at all." In response to being asked what the difference between the Islamic Front's and ISIL's version of sharia would be, he said, "One of their mistakes is before the regime has fallen, and before they've established what in Sharia is called Tamkeen [having a stable state], they started applying Sharia, thinking God gave them permission to control the land and establish a Caliphate. This goes against the beliefs of religious scholars around the world. This is what [IS] did wrong. This is going to cause a lot of trouble.

=== Other commentaries ===
Scholar [[Ian Almond]] criticised the media commentators, the lack of balance in reporting, and the "way we are learning to talk about ISIS." While there was talk about 'radical evil' and 'radical Islam', Almond found it striking because "some of the most revered and oft-quoted figures in our Western political tradition have been capable of the most vicious acts of savagery – and yet all we ever hear about is how much the Middle East has to learn from us." Almond goes on to cite how [[Winston Churchill]] "wanted to gas women and children", how [[Ronald Reagan]]'s Central American policies "disembowlled more children than ISIS," how President [[Barack Obama]]'s "planes and drones have dropped bombs on as many schoolchildren as ISIS," how former secretary of state [[Madeleine Albright]] commented on the deaths of Iraqi children killed by sanctions, how [[Henry Kissinger]] and [[Margaret Thatcher]] "assisted in the torture and disappearance of thousands of Chilean students and labour activitists... For anyone familiar with the history of both U.S. and European torture and murder over the past 150 years, it might not be all that hyperbolic to say that in ISIS, what we see more than anything else is a more expansive, explicit version of our own cruelties. In bombing ISIS and its would-be imperialism, we are really bombing a version of ourselves."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://politicaltheology.com/are-we-isis-ian-almond|last=Almond|first=Ian|title=Are we ISIS?|date=7 January 2015|publisher=Political Theology|access-date=21 April 2019}}</ref>

Author and commentator [[Tom Engelhardt]] attributed the rise of ISIL and the destruction that followed to what he dubbed as America's drive to establish its own caliphate in the region.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://mondediplo.com/openpage/how-america-made-isis|last=Engelhardt|first=Tom|title=How America made ISIS|date=3 September 2014|publisher=Le Monde Diplomatique|access-date=21 April 2019}}</ref>

A leader article in the [[New Scientist]] magazine contextualised ISIL within the [[nation state]] construct. Although the group is described as medieval in the pejorative sense, "it is also hyper-modern, interested in few of the trappings of a conventional state apart from its own brutal brand of law enforcement. In fact, it is more of a network than a nation, having made canny use of social media to exert influence far beyond its geographical base."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22329851-500-in-our-world-beyond-nations-the-future-is-medieval|title=In our world beyond nations, the future is medieval|date=3 September 2014|publisher=New Scientist|access-date=25 April 2019}}</ref>

In a [[Middle East Institute]] in October 2020, Lobo Institute's Eric Oehlerich, [[Mick Mulroy]], and Liam McHugh state "The international community has an ethical, moral, and practical security obligation to fully resolve the ISIS problem." They lay out a comprehensive approach to the situation in detention facilities and refugee camps. They also caution that the next generation of ISIS will be created if nothing is done. <ref>{{cite report |first1=Eric |last1=Oehlerich |first2=Mick |last2=Mulroy |first3=Liam |last3=McHugh |title=Jannah or Jahannam: Options for Dealing with ISIS Detainees |date=13 October 2020 |publisher=Middle East Institute |type=Policy Paper |url=https://www.mei.edu/publications/jannah-or-jahannam-options-dealing-isis-detainees#pt11}}</ref>

Many world leaders and government spokespeople have called ISIL a terrorist group or banned it, without their countries having formally designated it as such. The following are examples:

The Government of Germany banned ISIL in September 2014. Activities banned include donations to the group, recruiting fighters, holding ISIL meetings and distributing its propaganda, [[Strafgesetzbuch section 86a|flying ISIL flags]],<ref>{{cite news |last1=Eddy |first1=Melissa |title=Germany Bans Support for ISIS |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/13/world/europe/germany-bans-support-of-isis.html |work=The New York Times |date=12 September 2014}}</ref> wearing ISIL symbols and all ISIL activities. "The terror organisation Islamic State is a threat to public safety in Germany as well", said German politician [[Thomas de Maizière]].

[[Al-Nusra Front]] is a branch of [[al-Qaeda]] operating in Syria. Al-Nusra has launched many attacks and [[List of bombings during the Syrian Civil War|bombings]], mostly against targets affiliated with or supportive of the Syrian government.<ref>{{cite news |first=Bill |last=Roggio |url=http://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2013/06/suicide_bombers_kill_14_in_dam.php |title=Suicide bombers kill 14 in Damascus |work=Long War Journal |date=11 June 2013 |access-date=3 June 2015}}</ref> There have been media reports that many of al-Nusra's foreign fighters have left to join al-Baghdadi's ISIL.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/syria/10067318/Syria-Jabhat-al-Nusra-split-after-leaders-pledge-of-support-for-al-Qaeda.html |title=Syria: Jabhat al-Nusra split after leader's pledge of support for al-Qaeda |work=The Telegraph |date=19 May 2013 |location=London |first=Richard |last=Spencer}}</ref>

{{quote|text=The two groups [ISIL and al-Nusra] share a nihilistic worldview, a loathing for modernity, and for the West. They subscribe to the same perverted interpretations of Islam. Other common traits include a penchant for suicide attacks, and sophisticated exploitation of the internet and social media. Like ISIL, several Al Qaeda franchises are interested in taking and holding territory; AQAP has been much less successful at it. The main differences between Al Qaeda and ISIL are largely political—and personal. Over the past decade, Al Qaeda has twice embraced ISIL (and its previous manifestations) as brothers-in-arms. |author=Bobby Ghosh |source="ISIL and Al Qaeda: Terror's frenemies", ''[[Quartz (publication)|Quartz]]''<ref>{{cite news |first=Bobby |last=Ghosh |url=http://qz.com/324909/isil-and-al-qaeda-terrors-frenemies/ |title=ISIL and Al Qaeda: Terror's frenemies |work=Quartz |date=12 January 2015}}</ref>}}

On 10 September 2015, an audio message was released by al-Qaeda's leader [[Ayman al-Zawahiri]] criticising ISIL's self-proclaimed caliphate and accusing it of "sedition". This was described by some media outlets as a "declaration of war".<ref>{{cite news |first=James Gordon |last=Meek |title=Al Qaeda Leader Al-Zawahiri Declares War on ISIS 'Caliph' Al-Baghdadi |url=https://news.yahoo.com/al-qaeda-leader-al-zawahiri-declares-war-isis-151231254--abc-news-topstories.html |via=Yahoo! News |publisher=ABC News |date=10 September 2015}}</ref> However, although al-Zawahiri denied ISIL's legitimacy, he suggested that there was still room for cooperation against common enemies, and said that if he were in Iraq, he would fight alongside ISIL.<ref>{{cite news |first=Omar |last=Fahmy |date=9 September 2015 |title=Al Qaeda calls Islamic State illegitimate but suggests cooperation |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/09/09/us-mideast-zawahri-idUSKCN0R91LY20150909 |publisher=Reuters |access-date=11 September 2015}}</ref>

In July 2014, the [[BBC]] reported the United Nations' chief investigator as stating: "Fighters from the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) may be added to a list of war crimes suspects in Syria."<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-28498661 |title=UN 'may include' Isis on Syrian war crimes list |work=BBC News|date=26 July 2014}}</ref> By June 2014, according to United Nations reports, ISIL had killed hundreds of prisoners of war<ref>"[https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/08/28/us-syria-crisis-idUSKBN0GS10O20140828 Video shows Islamic State executes scores of Syrian soldiers]". Reuters. 28 August 2014.</ref> and over 1,000 civilians.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

In November 2014, the UN Commission of Inquiry on Syria said that ISIL was committing [[crimes against humanity]].{{r|Larson}}<ref>{{cite news |last=<!-- staff writer --> |url=http://english.alarabiya.net/en/News/2014/11/14/ISIS-commits-crimes-against-humanity-in-Syria.html |title=ISIS accused of crimes against humanity |publisher=Al Arabiya |location=Dubai, United Arab Emirates |date=14 November 2014}}</ref> A report by [[Human Rights Watch]] in November 2014 accused ISIL groups in [[2014 ISIL takeover of Derna|control of Derna]], Libya of [[war crimes]] and [[human rights abuses]] and of terrorising residents. Human Rights Watch documented three apparent [[summary execution]]s and at least ten public floggings by the Islamic Youth Shura Council, which joined ISIL in November. It also documented the beheading of three Derna residents and dozens of seemingly politically motivated assassinations of judges, public officials, members of the security forces and others. Sarah Leah Watson, Director of HRW Middle East and North Africa, said: "Commanders should understand that they may face domestic or international prosecution for the grave rights abuses their forces are committing."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2014/11/27/libya-extremists-terrorizing-derna-residents |title=Libya: Extremists Terrorizing Derna Residents |publisher=Human Rights Watch |date=27 November 2014}}</ref>

Speaking of ISIL's methods, the [[United Nations Commission on Human Rights]] has stated that the group "seeks to subjugate civilians under its control and dominate every aspect of their lives through terror, indoctrination, and the provision of services to those who obey".{{r|UNRuleOfTerror}}
