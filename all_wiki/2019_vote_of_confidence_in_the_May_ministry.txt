On 15 January 2019, a [[motion of no confidence]] in the [[Second May ministry|government of Theresa May]] was tabled in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom]]. On 16 January, the House rejected it by a vote of 325 to 306.

The motion was laid by [[Jeremy Corbyn]], the [[Leader of the Labour Party (UK)|Leader of the Labour Party]] and [[Leader of the Opposition (UK)|Leader of the Opposition]], after the government lost a Commons vote to [[Meaningful vote|secure parliamentary backing for the government's deal]] for the [[Brexit|UK's withdrawal from the European Union]] by 230 votes on the evening of 15 January. That vote, 432 to 202 in favour of rejecting the deal, represented the largest defeat for a sitting government in modern history.

The motion was debated on the afternoon of 16 January before being voted on that evening. The vote went along party lines: it was supported by all opposition parties and opposed by the ruling [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] and the [[Democratic Unionist Party]], in accordance with their [[Conservative–DUP agreement|confidence and supply agreement]].

After the result, [[Theresa May]] requested individual meetings with [[List of political parties in the United Kingdom|leaders of all parties]] to discuss how to continue with the process of leaving the European Union. The invitation was taken up by all leaders except Corbyn, who said he would not meet the Prime Minister unless she could ensure that a [[no-deal Brexit]] would not occur.

==Background==
The Conservative government elected in the [[2017 United Kingdom general election|2017 general election]] was a [[minority government]], relying on [[Conservative–DUP agreement|a confidence and supply agreement with the Democratic Unionist Party]] to give it a small working majority in the House of Commons.

In December 2018, May had faced a [[2018 Conservative Party vote of confidence in the leadership of Theresa May|vote of confidence]] from members of the [[Parliamentary Conservative Party]] because of opposition from [[European Research Group|Eurosceptic Conservative MPs]] to her [[Brexit withdrawal agreement]], which they felt would compromise the UK's control over its borders due to its inclusion of the [[Irish backstop|Irish backstop proposal]], a proposal that would allow for the possibility of [[Northern Ireland]] remaining within the [[EU Customs Union]] as a means to avoid a [[Republic of Ireland–United Kingdom border|physical border]] with the [[Republic of Ireland|Irish Republic]] following the UK's departure from the EU. However, although May won the vote comfortably with a majority of 83, plans for the House of Commons to debate the Brexit agreement in December were postponed until the new year when it became clear Parliament would reject it.<ref>{{cite magazine |first=Andrew |last=Atkinson |url = http://time.com/5501580/labour-party-theresa-may-vote/ |title=U.K. Labour Party Vows to Hold No-Confidence Vote |magazine=Time |date=13 January 2019 |accessdate=19 January 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/no-confidence-vote-theresa-may-brexit-what-time-when-conservative-labour-corbyn-a8730491.html |title=Brexit: Everything you need to know about the vote of no confidence in the government |publisher=Independent Print Limited |newspaper=The Independent |date=15 January 2019 |accessdate=19 January 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-46885828 |title=Brexit: Theresa May's deal is voted down in historic Commons defeat |work=BBC News |publisher=BBC |date=15 January 2019 |accessdate=19 January 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-46547246 |title=Theresa May survives confidence vote of Tory MPs |publisher=BBC |work=BBC News |date=12 December 2018 |accessdate=21 January 2019}}</ref>

On 17 December, and following May's decision to delay the vote, Corbyn [[Table (parliamentary procedure)|tabled a motion]] of no confidence in her premiership, but not against the government.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-46599895|title=Labour makes no-confidence move against PM|date=17 December 2018|work=BBC News|accessdate=17 December 2018}}</ref> The following day the [[Government of the United Kingdom|government]] refused to allow time for the motion to be debated, which [[Speaker of the House of Commons (United Kingdom)|Speaker]] [[John Bercow]] confirmed they were under no obligation to do.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-46600850|title=Brexit: Cabinet 'ramps up' no-deal planning|date=18 December 2018|accessdate=18 December 2018|work=BBC News}}</ref>

Parliament subsequently debated the Brexit agreement in January 2019, with the vote on whether to back May's plans taking place on 15 January.<ref>{{cite news|last=Britton |first=Bianca |url=https://edition.cnn.com/2019/01/15/uk/brexit-vote-theresa-may-gbr-intl/index.html |title=Record defeat in House of Commons for Theresa May's Brexit deal |work=CNN International |publisher=CNN |date=15 January 2019 |accessdate=19 January 2019}}</ref> The deal was rejected by Parliament, with a majority of 230 voting against it.

[[Leader of the House of Commons]] [[Andrea Leadsom]] said that the House's afternoon session on 16 January, following the conclusion of [[Prime Minister's Questions]], would be dedicated to the debate, with a vote expected at around 19:00.<ref>{{cite news |title=How does a no-confidence motion work, and what's next for May? |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/15/theresa-may-landmark-brexit-defeat-what-happens-now-no-confidence |accessdate=15 January 2019 |newspaper=The Guardian |date=15 January 2019}}</ref>

In accordance with the [[Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011]], the text of the motion was "''That this House has lost confidence in Her Majesty's Government''". In addition to Corbyn, it was co-sponsored by [[Ian Blackford]] (SNP leader at Westminster), [[Vince Cable]] (Liberal Democrat leader), [[Liz Saville Roberts]] (Plaid Cymru), [[Caroline Lucas]] (Greens) and [[Nick Brown]] (Labour Chief Whip) and signed by a further 38 MPs.<ref>{{cite web |title=Wednesday 16 January 2019 Order Paper No.233: |url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201719/cmagenda/OP190116.pdf |publisher=House of Commons |accessdate=16 January 2019}}</ref>

==Division==
The motion was defeated by 325 votes to 306: a majority of 19. Ten DUP MPs and the independent MP [[Sylvia Hermon]] voted with the government. All the other parties in the Commons supported Labour's motion, as did some independent MPs, including [[Jared O'Mara]] and [[Stephen Lloyd]]. Three independent MPs, all formerly in Labour, abstained, as did [[Paul Flynn (politician)|Paul Flynn]] (Labour), who was too ill to vote.<ref>{{cite news |title=May's government survives no confidence vote |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-46899466 |accessdate=16 January 2019 |issue=16 January 2019 |work=BBC News}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Sparrow |first1=Andrew |last2=Weaver |first2=Matthew |last3=Lyons |first3=Kate |title=No-confidence motion fails by 325 to 306 votes – Politics live |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/jan/16/brexit-vote-theresa-may-faces-no-confidence-vote-after-crushing-defeat |website=The Guardian |accessdate=16 January 2019 |date=16 January 2019}}</ref>

==Aftermath==
After the result, May told Members of the House of Commons she would "continue to work to deliver on the solemn promise to the people of this country to deliver on the result of the referendum and leave the [[European Union]]". As a result of this, she requested to meet [[List of political parties in the United Kingdom|leaders of all parties]] to have individual meetings on how to continue with the process of leaving the European Union. In reaction to the result, Corbyn asked May to ensure that a [[Brexit negotiations#The .22no deal.22 scenario|no-deal Brexit]] would not occur, telling MPs that the government should "remove clearly, once and for all, the prospect of the catastrophe of a no-deal exit from the EU". This idea of eliminating the possibility of a no-deal Brexit was backed by the SNP, despite the impossibility of the request.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/nickeardleybbc/status/1085650087265460232|title=SNP join those demanding No Deal taken off table before talks can begin.|last=Eardley|first=Nick|date=2019-01-16|website=@nickeardleybbc|language=en|access-date=2019-01-16}}</ref>

May made a statement to the nation from [[Downing Street]] at 22:00.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-46899466|title=May's government survives no confidence vote|date=2019-01-16|access-date=2019-01-16|publisher=BBC|language=en-GB}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Theresa May’s full statement |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/jan/16/brexit-vote-theresa-may-faces-no-confidence-vote-after-crushing-defeat?page=with:block-5c3fac90e4b0197a614f46c5#block-5c3fac90e4b0197a614f46c5 |accessdate=17 January 2019 |publisher=Guardian Live |date=16 January 2019 }}</ref> In it she urged MPs to "put self-interest aside" and "work constructively together" to achieve a solution to Brexit.<ref>{{cite news |url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/uk-politics-46900548/brexit-theresa-may-gives-downing-street-statement |title = Brexit: Theresa May gives Downing Street statement |work=BBC News |publisher=BBC |date=16 January 2019 |accessdate=17 January 2019 }}</ref>

On the next day, it was reported that the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] ([[Philip Hammond]]) reassured executives from leading companies when he spoke to them for more than an hour at 9.30pm on Tuesday, that the government had no intention to have a no-deal Brexit occurring; he also said that a [[Backbencher|backbench]] motion could force the government to rescind [[United Kingdom invocation of Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union|Article 50]]. This would act as a "sort of ultimate backstop if the work the government is doing in seeking to find a way forward fails to deliver".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/17/hammond-tells-business-leaders-no-deal-brexit-will-be-stopped|title=Philip Hammond tells business no-deal Brexit will be stopped|last=Quinn|first=Ben|date=2019-01-17|work=The Guardian|access-date=2019-01-17|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>

Corbyn also laid out conditions for the Labour party to support a second referendum. In a speech he asserted  "If the government remains intransigent, if support for Labour's alternative is blocked for party advantage – and the country is facing the potential disaster of no deal – our duty will then be to look at other options which we've set out in our conference motion, including the option of a public vote."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.sky.com/story/jeremy-corbyn-sets-out-conditions-for-second-eu-referendum-support-11609985|title=Jeremy Corbyn sets out conditions for second EU referendum support|website=Sky News|language=en|access-date=2019-01-17}}</ref> He also requested, through the use of email, that Labour MP's should not partake in any Brexit discussions with the government until May would rule out a no-deal Brexit; this was after three Labour MPs – [[Hilary Benn]], [[Yvette Cooper]] and [[John Mann (British politician)|John Mann]] – went to the [[Cabinet Office]] to meet conservative ministers and discuss a solution to the crisis.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-jeremy-corbyn-labour-theresa-may-deal-vote-government-hilary-benn-yvette-cooper-a8733036.html|title=Corbyn orders Labour MPs to boycott Brexit talks with government until Theresa May drops no-deal threats|date=2019-01-17|website=The Independent|language=en|access-date=2019-01-17}}</ref>
