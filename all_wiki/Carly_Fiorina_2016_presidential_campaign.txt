The '''2016 presidential campaign''' of [[Carly Fiorina]] was announced in a video message posted on May 4, 2015.

=== Controversy over tenure at Lucent and Hewlett-Packard ===
Shortly after Fiorina announced her entry into the 2016 presidential race, and in a replay of her 2010 senatorial race, social media and editorial outlets referenced her tenure as HP's CEO and chair as a basis for her run for president. Commentators challenged Fiorina's claims of success, citing dozens of examples and anecdotes of why Fiorina had allegedly failed in her business leadership roles at both [[Hewlett-Packard]] and [[Lucent]].  The discussion revolved around the 30,000 U.S. job cuts as well as [[offshoring]], which Fiorina directed during her tenure at HP, contrasting it with the high compensation bonuses she received from the company, and the events surrounding her resignation from HP.<ref name=CNN515>{{cite news|last=Lee |first=MJ |date=May 5, 2015 |url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/05/04/politics/carly-fiorina-hewlett-packard-2016-elections/index.html |title=Carly Fiorina's HP record clouds her campaign launch| publisher=CNN| access-date=May 6, 2015}}</ref>  Campaign manager Sarah Isgur Flores deflected the criticism saying, Fiorina "worked hard to save as many jobs as possible",<ref>{{cite news|last=Beres |first=Damon |date=May 4, 2015 |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/05/04/carly-fiorina-website_n_7204826.html?ir=Business |title=Presidential Candidate Carly Fiorina Didn't Register CarlyFiorina.org, And It's Coming Back To Haunt Her |work=[[Huffington Post]] |access-date=May 6, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Dunham |first1=Will |last2=Hay |first2=Andrew |date=May 5, 2015 |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/05/05/carly-fiorina-hewlett-packard_n_7213890.html?fb_comment_id=823669064388570_823754097713400&comment_id=823702464385230&reply_comment_id=823754097713400&offset=0&total_comments=195#f1598c8070f180c |title=Carly Fiorina Defends Tenure At Hewlett-Packard After Criticism Over Layoffs |work=Reuters |access-date=May 6, 2015}}</ref> and her defenders argued that Fiorina made difficult and unpopular decisions to turn around a struggling firm.<ref name=CNN515/>

On May 10, Fiorina appeared on ''[[Meet the Press]]''; responding to host [[Chuck Todd]]'s question asking if Fiorina has "regrets about those layoffs [that occurred while she was CEO of HP]", Fiorina said that they doubled the size of the company, grew it from 2% to 9%, tripled the rate of innovation to 11 patents a day, and grew jobs in the U.S. and abroad. She added "I had to make tough calls during tough times. Tough times that many technology companies didn't survive at all.<ref>{{cite web|title = Carly Fiorina fights back against HP layoff claims, says she doubled size of company|url = http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/may/10/carly-fiorina/carly-fiorina-fights-back-against-hp-layoff-claims/|access-date = 2015-08-11|date = 2015-05-10|last = Carroll|first = Lauren}}</ref> [[Andrew Sorkin]], from ''The New York Times'', challenged Fiorina's assertions about her success as a businesswoman, writing that these percentages refer to revenue and not profit, and that the revenue growth was a result of acquisitions.<ref>{{cite news|title=Carly Fiorina's Business Record: Not So Sterling|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/18/business/carly-fiorinas-record-not-so-sterling.htm|newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=28 August 2015|quote=Here's the problem: Those numbers she is referencing aren't Hewlett-Packard's profit.

In August 2015, and in what was reported as a rebuttal to Sorkin's article, [[Thomas Perkins (businessman)|Tom Perkins]], who was one of the HP board members who voted to oust Fiorina, published a full-page ad in the form of a letter in ''The New York Times'',<ref>{{cite news|title=Fiorina Super-PAC Takes Out Full-Page New York Times Ad Defending Business Record|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2015-08-27/fiorina-super-pac-takes-out-full-page-new-york-times-ad-defending-business-record|publisher=Bloomberg|access-date=28 August 2015|first=Ben|last=Brody|date=August 27, 2015}}</ref> paid for by a pro-Fiorina [[Political action committee|super PAC]] "CARLY for America", in which he commented on the firing from HP by saying: "Critics often claim Carly was fired at HP because she was unsuccessful.

In mid-September 2015, Fiorina addressed previous criticism from Yale business management scholar [[Jeffrey Sonnenfeld]] who had said in 2008 that Fiorina used a "street bully" style of management, and that she had been a failure as HP's CEO.<ref>{{cite news|title=Ousted Executive Provides a Feminine Face to the McCain Campaign|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/06/us/politics/06fiorina.html?_r=0|newspaper=The New York Times}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|title = Carly Fiorina's Business Record Is At Least As Bad As Donald Trump's|url = https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/carly-fiorina-business-record_55f9e2c7e4b08820d9173ee6|website = The Huffington Post|access-date = 2015-09-18|date=September 16, 2015}}</ref> He also described in August 2015 how Fiorina was saying she had doubled revenue at HP, but Sonnenfeld said this was an empty metric; the real gauge was that HP had lost 52% of its value during her tenure.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://fortune.com/2015/08/14/carly-fiorina-president-2/ |last=Sonnenfeld |first=Jeffrey |author-link=Jeffrey Sonnenfeld |date=August 14, 2015 |journal=Fortune |title=Carly Fiorina as a boss: The disappointing truth}}</ref> [[Donald Trump]], a Republican contender against Fiorina in the 2016 presidential race, used Sonnenfeld's analysis against her during the second televised debate in 2015, and she countered by calling Sonnenfeld a "Clintonite".<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://time.com/4037239/second-republican-debate-transcript-cnn/ |title=Transcript: Read the Full Text of the Second Republican Debate |last=Beckwith |first=Ryan Teague |date=September 16, 2015 |journal=Time}}</ref> Sonnenfeld wrote back in ''Politico'' magazine that problems with Fiorina's leadership style were what caused HP to lose half its value during her tenure. He said she does not admit mistakes and thus does not learn from them, that she manipulates statistics, that she makes poor executive decisions, and that she turns to ''ad hominem'' attacks when others oppose her plans. Sonnenfeld responded that four of the 2016 Republican presidential candidates had requested and received his advice, and that he had never been a "Clintonite".<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/09/carly-fiorina-ceo-jeffrey-sonnenfeld-2016-213163 |work=Politico magazine |last=Sonnenfeld |first=Jeffrey |author-link=Jeffrey Sonnenfeld |title=Why I Still Think Fiorina Was a Terrible CEO |date=September 20, 2015}}</ref>

Fiorina's presidential campaign had provoked both praise and criticism.

===Foreign and military policy===
Fiorina has criticized the [[Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action|Iran nuclear agreement]], based on a number of issues that she called "suspicious".

===Immigration===
In California, Fiorina supported the [[DREAM Act]], which would allow [[Undocumented youth in the United States|children brought to the U.S. by their parents]] when they were under the age of 16 to secure permanent U.S. residency and a path to citizenship if they graduate from college or serve in the armed forces.<ref name="PBS Issues"/><ref name=Mullany/><ref name="Knowles">David Knowles, [https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2015-05-04/carly-fiorina-no-path-to-citizenship-for-those-who-came-to-u-s-illegally Carly Fiorina: No Path to Citizenship for those Who Came to U.S. Illegally], Bloomberg (May 4, 2015).</ref>

She blasted business leaders in Silicon Valley and elsewhere who have criticized the Indiana law as discriminatory, questioning why there isn't similar outrage  "in the Twitterverse about the subjugation of the rights of women and gays in many countries in which these companies do business.

Fiorina opposes [[net neutrality]] rules adopted by the [[Federal Communications Commission]] and has said she would "roll back" that policy, because "Regulation over innovation is a really bad role for government."<ref name="PBS Issues"/><ref>Charlotte Alter, [http://time.com/3847646/carly-fiorina-fcc-regulations-net-neutrality/ Carly Fiorina Says She Would 'Roll Back' Net Neutrality Rules], ''Time'' (May 5, 2015).</ref><ref>Carly Fiorina, [http://www.cnn.com/2015/04/07/opinions/fiorina-net-neutrality/ Op-ed: Obama's net neutrality failure], CNN (April 7, 2015).</ref>

===Regulation===
Fiorina "generally believes that reducing government regulations helps to spur the economy."<ref name="Mullany"/>

Fiorina has condemned the [[Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act]], saying in April 2015 that "We should get rid of Dodd-Frank and start again."<ref>Kevin Cirilli, [http://thehill.com/policy/finance/238254-fiorina-abolish-wall-street-reform-law Fiorina: Abolish Wall Street reform law], ''The Hill'' (April 9, 2015).</ref>

Fiorina has stated that not "a single regulation has ever been repealed."<ref name="Kessler">Glenn Kessler, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/wp/2015/04/27/carly-fiorinas-claim-that-not-a-single-regulation-has-ever-been-repealed/ Fact Checker: Carly Fiorina's claim that not 'a single regulation' has ever been repealed], ''The Washington Post'' (April 27, 2015).</ref> [[Glenn Kessler (journalist)|Glenn Kessler]] of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' "Fact Checker" column gave this statement three out of four [[Pinocchio]]s, finding that "Important parts of the economy have been deregulated in recent decades. While the repeal of a specific rule is relatively rare, there are certainly examples."<ref name="Kessler"/> [[Susan Dudley|Susan E. Dudley]], director of the Regulatory Studies Center at [[George Washington University]], said that Fiorina is "generally right that regulations, once issued, are rarely revisited and even more rarely actually repealed".<ref name="Kessler"/>

===Taxation===

During her 2010 Senate campaign, Fiorina "called for eliminating the [[Estate tax in the United States|estate tax]] and [[Capital gains tax in the United States|capital gains taxes]] for investments in small businesses, and lowering marginal [[tax rate]]s."<ref name="Mullany"/>

Fiorina opposes proposals to increase the [[Fuel taxes in the United States|federal gas tax or state gas taxes]] in order to fund the [[Highway Trust Fund]], asserting in a February 2015 op-ed in ''The Wall Street Journal'' that "Any gas tax hike, big or small, will harm American families and hurt economic growth."<ref>Carly Fiorina & Penny Nance, [https://www.wsj.com/articles/carly-fiorina-and-penny-nance-cheaper-gas-politicians-want-a-tax-fill-up-1423700365 Op-ed: Cheaper Gas?

==Vice Presidential campaign==
On April 27, 2016, Sen. [[Ted Cruz]] announced that Fiorina would be his running mate should he win the nomination.<ref name="aol.com"/> She joined his campaign in the [[United States presidential election in Indiana, 2016|Indiana Primary]], which he lost.  Cruz then suspended his campaign that evening. Fiorina's vice presidential campaign lasted precisely one week.<ref name="msnbc.com"/>

In December of that year, a "[[faithless elector]]" from Texas gave her one [[United States Electoral College|electoral vote]] for Vice President.
