The '''Democratic Party''' is one of the [[Two-party system|two]] [[Major party|major]] contemporary [[political parties in the United States]], along with its main, historic rival, the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. Tracing its heritage back to [[Thomas Jefferson]] and [[James Madison]]'s [[Democratic-Republican Party]], the modern-day Democratic Party was founded around 1828 by supporters of [[Andrew Jackson]], making it the world's oldest active political party.<ref>"The Democratic Party, founded in 1828, is the world's oldest political party" states {{Cite book |last1=Kenneth Janda |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t_lC8k3SELMC&pg=PA276 |title=The Challenge of Democracy: American Government in Global Politics |last2=Jeffrey M.

Before 1860, the party supported [[limited government]] and [[States' rights|state sovereignty]] while opposing a national bank and high tariffs. In the late 19th century, it continued to oppose high tariffs and had bitter internal debates on the [[gold standard]]. In the early 20th century, it supported [[Progressivism in the United States|progressive]] reforms and opposed imperialism. Since [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] and his [[New Deal coalition]] in the 1930s, the Democratic Party has promoted a [[Social liberalism|social liberal]] platform.<ref name="sarnold">{{cite book|last=Arnold|first=N.

{{main|History of the Democratic Party (United States)}}
[[File:Andrew Jackson (Engraved Portrait).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Andrew Jackson]] was the [[List of Presidents of the United States|seventh President of the United States]] (1829–1837) and the [[History of the United States Democratic Party|first Democratic]] [[President of the United States|President]].]]

Democratic Party officials often trace its origins to the inspiration of the [[Democratic-Republican Party]], founded by [[Thomas Jefferson]], [[James Madison]] and other influential opponents of the [[Federalist Party|Federalists]] in 1792. That party also inspired the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whigs]] and modern Republicans. Organizationally, the modern Democratic Party truly arose in the 1830s with the election of [[Andrew Jackson]]. Since the nomination of [[William Jennings Bryan]] in 1896, the party has generally positioned itself to the [[Left-wing politics|left]] of the Republican Party on economic issues. Democrats have been more liberal on civil rights since 1948, although conservative factions which opposed them persisted in the South until the 1960s. On foreign policy, both parties have changed position several times.<ref>Arthur Paulson, ''Realignment and Party Revival: Understanding American Electoral Politics at the Turn of the Twenty-First Century'' (2000) pp. 46–72.</ref>

=== Background ===
The Democratic Party evolved from the [[Jeffersonian Republican]] or [[Democratic-Republican Party]] organized by Jefferson and Madison in opposition to the Federalist Party. The Democratic-Republican Party favored [[Republicanism in the United States|republicanism]]; a weak [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]]; [[states' rights]]; agrarian interests (especially Southern planters); and strict adherence to the [[Constitution]]. The party opposed a national bank and Great Britain.<ref>James Roger Sharp, ''American Politics in the Early Republic: The New Nation in Crisis'' (1993).</ref> After the [[War of 1812]], the Federalists virtually disappeared and the only national political party left was the Democratic-Republicans, which was prone to splinter along regional lines. The era of one-party rule in the United States, known as the [[Era of Good Feelings]], lasted from 1816 until 1828 when Andrew Jackson became president. Jackson and Martin Van Buren worked with allies in each state to form a new Democratic Party on a national basis. In the 1830s the rivals coalesced into the main rival to the Democrats.

=== 19th century ===
[[File:Martin Van Buren.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|[[Martin Van Buren]] was the [[List of Presidents of the United States|eighth President of the United States]] (1837–1841) and the [[History of the United States Democratic Party|second Democratic]] [[President of the United States|President]].]]
The Democratic-Republican Party split over the choice of a successor to President [[James Monroe]]. The faction that supported many of the old [[Jeffersonian democracy|Jeffersonian principles]], led by Andrew Jackson and [[Martin Van Buren]], became the modern Democratic Party.<ref>{{cite magazine |last1=Traub |first1=James |title=The Ugly Election That Birthed Modern American Politics |url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/archaeology-and-history/magazine/2016/11-12/america-presidential-elections-1824-corrupt-bargain/ |magazine=National Geographic |accessdate=July 6, 2018 |archive-date=July 7, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180707010137/https://www.nationalgeographic.com/archaeology-and-history/magazine/2016/11-12/america-presidential-elections-1824-corrupt-bargain/ |url-status=live}}</ref> As Norton explains the transformation in 1828: {{quote|Jacksonians believed the people's will had finally prevailed. Through a lavishly financed coalition of state parties, political leaders, and newspaper editors, a popular movement had elected the president. The Democrats became the nation's first well-organized national party [...] and tight party organization became the hallmark of nineteenth-century American politics.<ref>Mary Beth Norton et al., ''A People and a Nation, Volume I: to 1877'' (Houghton Mifflin, 2007) p. 287.</ref>|sign=|source=}}

Behind the platforms issued by state and national parties stood a widely shared political outlook that characterized the Democrats: {{quote|The Democrats represented a wide range of views but shared a fundamental commitment to the Jeffersonian concept of an agrarian society. They viewed the central government as the enemy of individual liberty. The 1824 "corrupt bargain" had strengthened their suspicion of Washington politics. [...] Jacksonians feared the concentration of economic and political power. They believed that government intervention in the economy benefited special-interest groups and created corporate monopolies that favored the rich. They sought to restore the independence of the individual—the artisan and the ordinary farmer—by ending federal support of banks and corporations and restricting the use of paper currency, which they distrusted. Their definition of the proper role of government tended to be negative, and Jackson's political power was largely expressed in negative acts. He exercised the veto more than all previous presidents combined. Jackson and his supporters also opposed reform as a movement. Reformers eager to turn their programs into legislation called for a more active government. But Democrats tended to oppose programs like educational reform mid the establishment of a public education system. They believed, for instance, that public schools restricted individual liberty by interfering with parental responsibility and undermined freedom of religion by replacing church schools. Nor did Jackson share reformers' humanitarian concerns. He had no sympathy for American Indians, initiating the removal of the Cherokees along the Trail of Tears.<ref>Mary Beth Norton et al., ''A People and a Nation, Volume I: to 1877'' (2007) pp. 287–288.</ref>|sign=|source=}}

Opposing factions led by [[Henry Clay]] helped form the Whig Party. The Democratic Party had a small yet decisive advantage over the Whigs until the 1850s, when the Whigs fell apart over the issue of slavery.

The Democrats split over the choice of a successor to President [[James Buchanan]] along Northern and Southern lines as factions of the party provided two separate candidacies for president in the [[1860 United States presidential election|election of 1860]], in which the Republican Party gained ascendancy.<ref>Jean H.

As the [[American Civil War]] broke out, Northern Democrats were divided into [[War Democrats]] and [[Copperheads (politics)|Peace Democrats]]. The [[Confederate States of America]], whose political leadership, mindful of the [[:wikt:welter|welter]] prevalent in antebellum American politics and with a pressing need for unity, largely viewed political parties as inimical to good governance and consequently the Confederacy had none or at least none with the wide organization inherent to other American parties. Most War Democrats rallied to Republican President Abraham Lincoln and the Republicans' [[National Union Party (United States)|National Union Party]] in the [[1864 United States presidential election|election of 1864]], which featured [[Andrew Johnson]] on the Republican ticket even though he was a Democrat from the South. Johnson replaced Lincoln in 1865, but he stayed independent of both parties.<ref>Mark E. Neely. ''Lincoln and the Democrats: The Politics of Opposition in the Civil War'' (2017).</ref>

The Democrats benefited from white Southerners' resentment of [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]] after the war and consequent hostility to the Republican Party. After [[Redeemers]] ended Reconstruction in the 1870s and following the often extremely violent [[Disenfranchisement after the Reconstruction Era|disenfranchisement]] of African Americans led by such [[White supremacy#Academic use of the term|white supremacist]] Democratic politicians as [[Benjamin Tillman]] of [[South Carolina]] in the 1880s and 1890s, the South, voting Democratic, became known as the "[[Solid South]]." Although Republicans won all but two presidential elections, the Democrats remained competitive. The party was dominated by pro-business [[Bourbon Democrat]]s led by [[Samuel J. Tilden]] and [[Grover Cleveland]], who represented mercantile, banking, and railroad interests; opposed [[imperialism]] and overseas expansion; fought for the [[gold standard]]; opposed [[bimetallism]]; and crusaded against corruption, high taxes and tariffs. Cleveland was elected to non-consecutive presidential terms in [[1884 United States presidential election|1884]] and [[1892 United States presidential election|1892]].<ref>Rutland, ''The Democrats: From Jefferson to Clinton'' (1995) ch. 5–6.</ref>

Agrarian Democrats demanding [[free silver]], drawing on Populist ideas, overthrew the Bourbon Democrats in 1896 and nominated [[William Jennings Bryan]] for the presidency (a nomination repeated by Democrats in 1900 and 1908). Bryan waged a vigorous campaign attacking Eastern moneyed interests, but he lost to Republican [[William McKinley]].<ref>Robert W. Cherny, ''A Righteous Cause: The Life of William Jennings Bryan'' (1994)</ref>

The Democrats took control of the House in 1910, and [[Woodrow Wilson]] won election as president in 1912 (when the Republicans split) and 1916. Wilson effectively led Congress to put to rest the issues of tariffs, money and antitrust, which had dominated politics for 40 years, with new progressive laws. He failed to secure Senate passage of the [[Versailles Treaty]] (ending the war with Germany and joining the League of Nations).<ref>H.W.

[[File:FDR in 1933.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|[[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], 32nd President of the United States (1933–1945)]]
The [[Great Depression]] in 1929 that began under Republican President [[Herbert Hoover]] and the Republican Congress set the stage for a more liberal government as the Democrats controlled the House of Representatives nearly uninterrupted from 1930 until 1994, the Senate  for 44 of 48 years from 1930, and won most presidential elections until 1968. [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], elected to the presidency in 1932, came forth with federal government programs called the [[New Deal]]. New Deal liberalism meant the regulation of business (especially finance and banking) and the promotion of labor unions as well as federal spending to aid the unemployed, help distressed farmers and undertake large-scale public works projects. It marked the start of the American welfare state.<ref>{{cite book|author=Ellen Russell|title=New Deal Banking Reforms and Keynesian Welfare State Capitalism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qzOUAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA4|year=2007|publisher=Routledge|pages=3–4|isbn=9781135910655|access-date=April 28, 2020|archive-date=October 2, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201002180941/https://books.google.com/books?id=qzOUAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA4&hl=en|url-status=live}}</ref> The opponents, who stressed opposition to unions, support for business and low taxes, started calling themselves "conservatives".<ref>Rutland, ''The Democrats: From Jefferson to Clinton'' (1995) ch. 7.</ref>

Until the 1980s, the Democratic Party was a coalition of two parties divided by the Mason–Dixon line: liberal Democrats in the North and culturally conservative voters in the South, who though benefitting from many of the New Deal public works projects opposed increasing [[Civil and political rights|civil rights]] initiatives advocated by Northeastern liberals. The polarization grew stronger after Roosevelt died. Southern Democrats formed a key part of the bipartisan [[conservative coalition]] in an alliance with most of the Midwestern Republicans. The economically activist philosophy of Franklin D. Roosevelt, which has strongly influenced [[Liberalism in the United States|American liberalism]], shaped much of the party's economic agenda after 1932.<ref>David M. Kennedy, ''Freedom from Fear: The American People in Depression and War, 1929-1945'' (2001).</ref> From the 1930s to the mid-1960s, the liberal [[New Deal coalition]] usually controlled the presidency while the conservative coalition usually controlled Congress.<ref>Paul Finkelman and Peter Wallenstein, eds. ''The Encyclopedia Of American Political History'' (CQ Press, 2001) pp. 124–126.</ref>

Issues facing parties and the United States after World War II included the [[Cold War]] and the [[Civil Rights Movement]]. Republicans attracted conservatives and, after the 1960s, white Southerners from the Democratic coalition with their use of the [[Southern strategy]] and resistance to New Deal and [[Great Society]] liberalism. Until the 1950s, African Americans had traditionally supported the Republican Party because of its anti-slavery civil rights policies. Following the passage of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] and [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]], the Southern states became more reliably Republican in presidential politics, while Northeastern states became more reliably Democratic.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300077230/race-campaign-politics-and-realignment-south|title=Race, Campaign Politics, and the Realignment in the South|website=yalebooks.yale.edu|accessdate=June 9, 2018|archive-date=June 5, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190605173805/https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300077230/race-campaign-politics-and-realignment-south|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="Regional Variations in the Realignment of American Politics, 1944–2004">{{cite journal|last1=Bullock|first1=Charles S.|last2=Hoffman|first2=Donna R.|last3=Gaddie|first3=Ronald Keith|date=2006|title=Regional Variations in the Realignment of American Politics, 1944–2004|journal=Social Science Quarterly|volume=87|issue=3|pages=494–518|doi=10.1111/j.1540-6237.2006.00393.x|issn=0038-4941|quote=The events of 1964 laid open the divisions between the South and national Democrats and elicited distinctly different voter behavior in the two regions.

[[File:John F. Kennedy, White House color photo portrait.jpg|thumb|upright|[[John F. Kennedy]], 35th President of the United States (1961–1963)]]
The election of President [[John F. Kennedy]] from Massachusetts in 1960 was a partial reflection of this shift. In the campaign, Kennedy attracted a new generation of younger voters. In his agenda dubbed the [[New Frontier]], Kennedy introduced a host of social programs and public works projects, along with enhanced support of the [[NASA|space program]], proposing a manned spacecraft [[Apollo 11|trip to the moon]] by the end of the decade. He pushed for civil rights initiatives and proposed the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]], but with his [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|assassination]] in November 1963, he was not able to see its passage.<ref>James T. Patterson, ''Grand Expectations: The United States, 1945-1974'' (1997).</ref>
[[File:Martin Luther King, Jr. and Lyndon Johnson 3.jpg|thumb|left|[[Lyndon B. Johnson]], 36th President of the United States (1963–1969), meeting with [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] at the [[Oval Office]] in 1963]]

Kennedy's successor [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] was able to persuade the largely conservative Congress to pass the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and with a more progressive Congress in 1965 passed much of the [[Great Society]], which consisted of an array of social programs designed to help the poor. Kennedy and Johnson's advocacy of civil rights further solidified black support for the Democrats but had the effect of alienating Southern whites who would eventually gravitate towards the Republican Party, particularly after the election of [[Ronald Reagan]] to the presidency in 1980. The United States' involvement in the [[Vietnam War]] in the 1960s was another divisive issue that further fractured the fault lines of the Democrats' coalition. After the [[Gulf of Tonkin Resolution]] in 1964, President Johnson committed a large contingency of combat troops to Vietnam, but the escalation failed to drive the [[Viet Cong]] from South Vietnam, resulting in an increasing [[Quagmire theory|quagmire]], which by 1968 had become the subject of widespread anti-war protests in the United States and elsewhere. With increasing casualties and nightly news reports bringing home troubling images from Vietnam, the costly military engagement became increasingly unpopular, alienating many of the kinds of young voters that the Democrats had attracted the early 1960s. The protests that year along with assassinations of [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] and Democratic presidential candidate Senator [[Robert F. Kennedy]] (younger brother of John F. Kennedy) climaxed in turbulence at the hotly-contested [[1968 Democratic National Convention|Democratic National Convention]] that summer in Chicago (which amongst the ensuing turmoil inside and outside of the convention hall nominated Vice President [[Hubert Humphrey]]) in a series of events that proved to mark a significant turning point in the decline of the Democratic Party's broad coalition.<ref>Patterson, ''Grand Expectations: The United States, 1945-1974'' (1997).</ref>

Republican presidential nominee [[Richard Nixon]] was able to capitalize on the confusion of the Democrats that year, and won the 1968 election to become the 37th president. He won re-election in a [[1972 United States presidential election|landslide]] in 1972 against Democratic nominee [[George McGovern]], who like Robert F. Kennedy, reached out to the younger anti-war and counterculture voters, but unlike Kennedy, was not able to appeal to the party's more traditional white working-class constituencies. During Nixon's second term, his presidency was rocked by the [[Watergate]] scandal, which forced him to resign in 1974. He was succeeded by vice president [[Gerald Ford]], who served a brief tenure. Watergate offered the Democrats an opportunity to recoup, and their nominee [[Jimmy Carter]] won the 1976 presidential election. With the initial support of [[evangelical]] Christian voters in the South, Carter was temporarily able to reunite the disparate factions within the party, but [[inflation]] and the [[Iran Hostage Crisis]] of 1979–1980 took their toll, resulting in a [[1980 United States presidential election|landslide]] victory for Republican presidential nominee [[Ronald Reagan]] in 1980, which shifted the political landscape in favor of the Republicans for years to come.

With the ascendancy of the Republicans under Ronald Reagan, the Democrats searched for ways to respond yet were unable to succeed by running traditional candidates, such as former vice president and Democratic presidential nominee [[Walter Mondale]], who lost to Reagan in the 1984 presidential election. Many Democrats attached their hopes to the future star of [[Gary Hart]], who had challenged Mondale in the 1984 primaries running on a theme of "New Ideas"; and in the subsequent 1988 primaries became the de facto front-runner and virtual "shoo-in" for the Democratic presidential nomination before his campaign was ended by a sex scandal. The party nevertheless began to seek out a younger generation of leaders, who like Hart had been inspired by the pragmatic idealism of John F. Kennedy.<ref>James T. Patterson, ''Restless Giant: The United States from Watergate to Bush v. Gore'' (2011).</ref>

Arkansas governor [[Bill Clinton]] was one such figure, who was elected president in 1992 as the Democratic nominee. He labeled himself and governed as a "[[New Democrats|New Democrat]]." The party adopted a [[Centrism|centrist]] economic yet [[Social progressivism|socially progressive]] agenda, with the voter base after Reagan having shifted considerably to the [[Right (politics)|right]]. In an effort to appeal both to liberals and to fiscal conservatives, Democrats began to advocate for a [[balanced budget]] and [[market economy]] tempered by [[Economic interventionism|government intervention]] ([[mixed economy]]), along with a continued emphasis on [[social justice]] and [[affirmative action]]. The economic policy adopted by the Democratic Party, including the former [[Presidency of Bill Clinton|Clinton administration]], has been referred to as "[[Third Way (centrism)|Third Way]]." The Democrats lost control of Congress in the [[Republican Revolution|election of 1994]] to the Republican Party. Re-elected in 1996, Clinton was the first Democratic president since Franklin D. Roosevelt to be elected to two terms.<ref>Patterson. ''Restless Giant: The United States from Watergate to Bush v. Gore'' (2011).</ref>

In the wake of the 2001 [[September 11 attacks|terrorist attacks]] on the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]] and [[the Pentagon]] as well as the growing concern over [[global warming]], some of the party's key issues in the early 21st century have included combating [[terrorism]] while preserving [[human rights]], expanding access to [[health care]], [[labor rights]], and environmental protection. The Democrats regained majority control of both the House and the Senate in the [[United States general elections, 2006|2006 elections]]. [[Barack Obama]] won the Democratic Party's nomination and was elected as the first [[African American]] president in 2008. Under the Obama presidency, the party moved forward reforms including an [[Economic Stimulus Act of 2009|economic stimulus]] package, the [[Dodd-Frank Act|Dodd–Frank]] financial reform act, and the [[Affordable Care Act]]. In the [[United States elections, 2010|2010 elections]], the Democratic Party lost control of the House and lost its majority in state legislatures and state governorships. In the [[2012 United States presidential election|2012 elections]], President Obama was re-elected, but the party remained in the minority in the House of Representatives and lost control of the Senate in 2014. After the [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 election]] of [[Donald Trump]], the Democratic Party transitioned into the role of an opposition party and currently hold neither the presidency nor the Senate but won back a majority in the House in the [[2018 United States House of Representatives elections|2018 midterm elections]].<ref>Rutland, ''The Democrats: From Jefferson to Clinton'' (1995) ch 8</ref> Democrats have been extremely critical of President Trump, particularly his policies on immigration, healthcare, and abortion, as well as his response to the [[COVID-19 pandemic]].<ref>{{cite news|last=York|first=David Smith Molly Redden in New|date=2016-04-01|title=Donald Trump's abortion remarks provoke biggest crisis of his campaign|language=en-GB|work=The Guardian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/31/donald-trump-abortion-remarks-biggest-campaign-crisis |df=mdy-all|access-date=2020-06-29|issn=0261-3077|archive-date=July 29, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200729191734/https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/31/donald-trump-abortion-remarks-biggest-campaign-crisis|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|last=McCormick|first=Stephanie Armour and John|date=2020-03-14|title=Democrats Sharpen Criticism of Trump's Health-Care Policy in Coronavirus Pandemic|language=en-US|work=Wall Street Journal|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/democrats-sharpen-criticism-of-trumps-health-care-policy-in-coronavirus-pandemic-11584195089 |df=mdy-all|access-date=2020-06-29|issn=0099-9660|archive-date=July 29, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200729182405/https://www.wsj.com/articles/democrats-sharpen-criticism-of-trumps-health-care-policy-in-coronavirus-pandemic-11584195089|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Trump WHO decision draws criticism from Democrats in US Congress|url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/04/trump-decision-draws-criticism-democrats-congress-200415184644345.html |df=mdy-all|access-date=2020-06-29|website=www.aljazeera.com|archive-date=July 29, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200729193902/https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/04/trump-decision-draws-criticism-democrats-congress-200415184644345.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

The [[Democratic-Republican Party]] splintered in 1824 into the short-lived [[National Republican Party]] and the Jacksonian movement which in 1828 became the Democratic Party. Under the Jacksonian era, the term "The Democracy" was in use by the party, but the name "Democratic Party" was eventually settled upon<ref>{{cite book|author=Appleby, Joyce|title=Thomas Jefferson|year=2003|page=4|isbn=978-0-521-64841-7|author-link=Joyce Appleby|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6rOu3WYEiiQC|access-date=April 28, 2020|archive-date=October 2, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201002180948/https://books.google.com/books?id=6rOu3WYEiiQC&hl=en|url-status=live}}</ref> and became the official name in 1844.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/157244/Democratic-Party/308570/Slavery-and-the-emergence-of-the-bipartisan-system|title=Democratic Party|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=January 19, 2015|archive-date=February 17, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150217133844/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/157244/Democratic-Party/308570/Slavery-and-the-emergence-of-the-bipartisan-system|url-status=live}}</ref> Members of the party are called "Democrats" or "Dems".

The term [[Democrat Party (epithet)|"Democrat Party"]] has also been in local use, but has usually been used by opponents since 1952 as a disparaging term.

The most common mascot symbol for the party has been the [[donkey]], or jackass.<ref>see [https://web.archive.org/web/20090307093800/https://www.democrats.org/a/2005/06/history_of_the.php "History of the Democratic Donkey"]</ref> [[Andrew Jackson]]'s enemies twisted his name to "jackass" as a term of ridicule regarding a stupid and stubborn animal.

Cartoonists followed Nast and used the donkey to represent the Democrats and the elephant to represent the [[History of the Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]].

In the early 20th century, the traditional symbol of the Democratic Party in Indiana, Kentucky, Oklahoma and Ohio was the rooster, as opposed to the Republican eagle. This symbol still appears on Oklahoma, Kentucky, Indiana, and West Virginia [[ballot]]s.<ref>{{cite web|title=Barbour County, West Virginia General Election Ballot|date=November 4, 2008|url=http://www.wvsos.com/elections/ballots/barbourgen.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081024032144/https://www.wvsos.com/elections/ballots/barbourgen.pdf|archive-date=October 24, 2008}}</ref> The rooster was adopted as the official symbol of the national Democratic Party.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ithaca.edu/rhp/programs/cmd/blogs/posters_and_election_propaganda/the_rooster_as_the_symbol_of_the_u.s._democratic_p/|title=The Rooster as the Symbol of the U.S. Democratic Party|first=Steven|last= Seidman| publisher=Ithaca College|date=June 12, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171024043133/http://www.ithaca.edu/rhp/programs/cmd/blogs/posters_and_election_propaganda/the_rooster_as_the_symbol_of_the_u.s._democratic_p/|

Although both major political parties (and many minor ones) use the traditional American colors of red, white and blue in their marketing and representations, since [[2000 United States presidential election|election night 2000]] blue has become the identifying color for the Democratic Party while red has become the identifying color for the Republican Party. That night, for the first time all major broadcast television networks used the same color scheme for the electoral map: [[Red states and blue states|blue states]] for [[Al Gore]] (Democratic nominee) and red states for [[George W. Bush]] (Republican nominee). Since then, the color blue has been widely used by the media to represent the party. This is contrary to common practice outside of the United States where blue is the traditional color of the [[right-wing politics|right]] and red the color of the [[left-wing politics|left]].<ref name="WP Nov 2004">{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A17079-2004Nov1.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509144731/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A17079-2004Nov1.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=May 9, 2008|title=Elephants Are Red, Donkeys Are Blue|last=Farhi|first=Paul|date=November 2, 2004|newspaper=Washington Post|page=C01|accessdate=October 11, 2016}}</ref> For example, in Canada red represents the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberals]] while blue represents the [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservatives]]. In the United Kingdom, red denotes the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] and blue symbolizes the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]]. Any use of the color blue to denote the Democratic Party prior to 2000 would be historically inaccurate and misleading. Since 2000, blue has also been used both by party supporters for promotional efforts—[[ActBlue]], BuyBlue and BlueFund as examples—and by the party itself in 2006 both for its "Red to Blue Program", created to support Democratic candidates running against Republican incumbents in the [[United States general elections, 2006|midterm elections]] that year and on its official website.

In September 2010, the Democratic Party unveiled its new logo, which featured a blue D inside a blue circle. It was the party's first official logo; the donkey logo had only been semi-official.

[[Jefferson-Jackson Day]] is the annual fundraising event (dinner) held by Democratic Party organizations across the United States.<ref>{{cite news|first=Bill|last=Trotter|title=Obama sets sights on November battle|newspaper=[[Bangor Daily News]]|date=February 11, 2008|url=http://www.bangornews.com/news/t/city.aspx?articleid=160039&zoneid=176|accessdate=February 12, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080228050855/http://www.bangornews.com/news/t/city.aspx?articleid=160039&zoneid=176|archive-date=February 28, 2008}}</ref> It is named after Presidents [[Thomas Jefferson]] and [[Andrew Jackson]], whom the party regards as its distinguished early leaders.

The song "[[Happy Days Are Here Again]]" is the unofficial song of the Democratic Party. It was used prominently when [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] was nominated for president at the [[1932 Democratic National Convention]] and remains a sentimental favorite for Democrats today. For example, [[Paul Shaffer]] played the theme on the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'' after the Democrats won Congress in 2006. "[[Don't Stop (Fleetwood Mac song)|Don't Stop]]" by [[Fleetwood Mac]] was adopted by [[Bill Clinton]]'s presidential campaign in 1992 and has endured as a popular Democratic song. The emotionally similar song "[[Beautiful Day]]" by the band [[U2]] has also become a favorite theme song for Democratic candidates. [[John Kerry]] used the song during his 2004 presidential campaign and several Democratic Congressional candidates used it as a celebratory tune in 2006.<ref>{{cite news|first=Michael|last=Gruss|title=Local roast becomes political pep rally for Democrats|newspaper=[[The Virginian-Pilot]]|date=November 21, 2006|url=http://hamptonroads.com/node/185421|accessdate=April 15, 2007|archive-date=February 25, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150225035614/http://hamptonroads.com/node/185421|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|first=Michael|last=Scherer|title=The Democrats are ready to lead|work=[[Salon.com]]|date=November 8, 2006|url=https://www.salon.com/news/feature/2006/11/08/pelosi/|accessdate=March 18, 2007|archive-date=August 11, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090811050908/http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2006/11/08/pelosi/|url-status=live}}</ref>

== Current structure and composition ==

=== National committee ===
The [[Democratic National Committee]] (DNC) is responsible for promoting Democratic campaign activities. While the DNC is responsible for overseeing the process of writing the Democratic Platform, the DNC is more focused on campaign and organizational strategy than [[public policy]]. In presidential elections, it supervises the [[Democratic National Convention]]. The national convention is subject to the charter of the party and the ultimate authority within the Democratic Party when it is in session, with the DNC running the party's organization at other times. The DNC is chaired by former [[United States Secretary of Labor|Labor Secretary]] [[Tom Perez]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Przybyla |first=Heidi |date=February 25, 2017 |title=Democrats elect Tom Perez, former Labor secretary, as new party leader |newspaper=USA Today }}</ref>

=== State parties ===
{{main|List of state parties of the Democratic Party (United States)}}
Each state also has a state committee, made up of elected committee members as well as ex officio committee members (usually elected officials and representatives of major constituencies), which in turn elects a chair. County, town, city and ward committees generally are composed of individuals elected at the local level. State and local committees often coordinate campaign activities within their jurisdiction, oversee local conventions and in some cases primaries or caucuses and may have a role in nominating candidates for elected office under state law. Rarely do they have much funding, but in 2005 DNC Chairman Dean began a program (called the "50 State Strategy") of using DNC national funds to assist all state parties and pay for full-time professional staffers.<ref>{{cite news|last=Gilgoff|first=Dan|title=Dean's List|date=July 16, 2006|url=https://www.usnews.com/usnews/news/articles/060716/24dems.htm|work=[[U.S. News & World Report]]|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/690hYQLWt?url=http://www.usnews.com/usnews/news/articles/060716/24dems.htm|archive-date=July 8, 2012|accessdate=April 26, 2007|url-status=dead|df=mdy}}</ref>

=== Major party groups ===
[[File:Barack Obama Speaks to College Democrats.jpg|thumb|right|[[Barack Obama]] speaking to [[College Democrats of America]] in 2007]]
The [[Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee]] (DCCC) assists party candidates in House races and its current chairman (selected by the party caucus) is Representative [[Cheri Bustos]] of Illinois. Similarly, the [[Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee]] (DSCC), headed by Senator [[Catherine Cortez Masto]] of Nevada, raises funds for Senate races. The [[Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee]] (DLCC), chaired by Oregon legislator Tina Kotek, is a smaller organization with much less funding that focuses on state legislative races. The DNC sponsors the [[College Democrats of America]] (CDA), a student-outreach organization with the goal of training and engaging a new generation of Democratic activists. [[Democrats Abroad]] is the organization for Americans living outside the United States and they work to advance the goals of the party and encourage Americans living abroad to support the Democrats. The [[Young Democrats of America]] (YDA) is a youth-led organization that attempts to draw in and mobilize young people for Democratic candidates but operates outside of the DNC. The [[Democratic Governors Association]] (DGA), chaired by Governor [[Gina Raimondo]] of [[Rhode Island]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://democraticgovernors.org/news/democratic-governors-elect-governor-gina-raimondo-as-next-dga-chair/|title=Democratic Governors Elect Governor Gina Raimondo as Next DGA Chair|date=December 1, 2018|website=Democratic Governors Association|accessdate=April 28, 2020|archive-date=July 29, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200729200814/https://democraticgovernors.org/news/democratic-governors-elect-governor-gina-raimondo-as-next-dga-chair/|url-status=live}}</ref> is an organization supporting the candidacies of Democratic gubernatorial nominees and incumbents.

== Ideology ==
{{Liberalism sidebar}}
{{further|Factions in the Democratic Party (United States)}}
Upon foundation, the Democratic Party supported [[agrarianism]] and the [[Jacksonian democracy]] movement of President [[Andrew Jackson]], representing farmers and rural interests and traditional [[Jeffersonian democracy|Jeffersonian democrats]].<ref>John Ashworth, ''"Agrarians" & "aristocrats": Party political ideology in the United States, 1837–1846''(1983)</ref> Since the 1890s, especially in northern states, the party began to favor more liberal positions (the term "liberal" in this sense describes [[Modern liberalism in the United States|modern liberalism]], rather than [[classical liberalism]] or [[economic liberalism]]).

Historically, the party has represented farmers, laborers, labor unions and religious and ethnic minorities as it has opposed unregulated business and finance and favored progressive income taxes. In foreign policy, [[internationalism (politics)|internationalism]] (including [[interventionism (politics)|interventionism]]) was a dominant theme from 1913 to the mid-1960s. In the 1930s, the party began advocating [[Social programs in the United States|welfare]] spending programs targeted at the poor. The party had a [[Fiscal conservatism|fiscally conservative]], [[Economic liberalism|pro-business]] wing, typified by [[Grover Cleveland]] and [[Al Smith]]; and a [[Southern Democrats|Southern]] conservative wing that shrank after President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] supported the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]]. The major influences for liberalism were labor unions (which peaked in the 1936–1952 era) and the [[African American]] wing, which has steadily grown since the 1960s. Since the 1970s, [[environmentalism]] has been a major new component. The 21st century Democratic Party is predominantly a coalition of centrists, liberals, and progressives, with significant overlap between the three groups.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Brownstein |first1=Ronald |title=The Democrats' Coalition Could Fundamentally Change by 2020 |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/05/democrats-progressive-agenda-and-2020-election/589066/ |website=The Atlantic |accessdate=March 13, 2020 |archive-date=March 23, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200323161712/https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/05/democrats-progressive-agenda-and-2020-election/589066/ |url-status=live}}</ref>

The Democratic Party, once dominant in the [[Southeastern United States]], is now strongest in the Northeast ([[Mid-Atlantic (United States)|Mid-Atlantic]] and [[New England]]), the [[Great Lakes region]], and the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] (including [[Hawaii]]). The party is also very strong in [[List of United States cities by population|major cities]] (regardless of region).<ref name="cities">{{cite web |last1=Thompson |first1=Derek |title=How Democrats Conquered the City |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/09/brief-history-how-democrats-conquered-city/597955/ |website=The Atlantic |accessdate=March 13, 2020 |archive-date=March 7, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200307075726/https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/09/brief-history-how-democrats-conquered-city/597955/ |url-status=live}}</ref>

=== Centrists ===
Centrist Democrats, or [[New Democrats]], are an ideologically [[Centrism|centrist]] faction within the Democratic Party that emerged after the victory of [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[George H. W. Bush]] in the [[1988 United States presidential election|1988 presidential election]]. They are an economically [[Economic liberalism|liberal]] and "[[Third Way]]" faction which dominated the party for around 20 years starting in the late 1980s after the United States populace turned much further to the [[political right]]. They are represented by organizations such as the [[New Democrat Network]] and the [[New Democrat Coalition]]. The New Democrat Coalition is a pro-growth and fiscally moderate congressional coalition.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://newdemocratcoalition-kind.house.gov/about-me|title=About Us - New Democrat Coalition|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305184704/http://newdemocratcoalition-kind.house.gov/about-me|archive-date=March 5, 2016|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

One of the most influential centrist groups was the [[Democratic Leadership Council]] (DLC), a nonprofit organization that advocated centrist positions for the party. The DLC hailed President [[Bill Clinton]] as proof of the viability of "Third Way" politicians and a DLC success story. The DLC disbanded in 2011 and much of the former DLC is now represented in the think tank [[Third Way (United States)|Third Way]].<ref>[http://www.prospect.org/cs/articles?article=how_the_dlc_does_it "How the DLC Does It"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110918040311/http://prospect.org/cs/articles?article=how_the_dlc_does_it |date=September 18, 2011}}, Robert Dreyfuss, ''American Prospect'', April 23, 2001.</ref>

While not representing a majority of the Democratic Party electorate, some Democratic elected officials have self-declared as being centrists. These Democrats include former President Bill Clinton, former Vice President [[Al Gore]], Senator [[Mark Warner]], former Pennsylvania governor [[Ed Rendell]], former Senator [[Jim Webb]], former Vice President [[Joe Biden]], congresswoman [[Ann Kirkpatrick]], and former congressman [[Dave McCurdy]].<ref name="Members - New Democrat Coalition">{{cite web|url=https://newdemocratcoalition-kind.house.gov/members|title=Members - New Democrat Coalition|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160907005152/https://newdemocratcoalition-kind.house.gov/members|archive-date=September 7, 2016|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|jstor=2152360|title=The Making of the New Democrats|first=Jon F.|last=Hale|date=January 1, 1995|journal=Political Science Quarterly|volume=110|issue=2|pages=207–232|doi=10.2307/2152360}}</ref>

=== Conservatives ===
A [[conservative Democrat]] is a member of the Democratic Party with [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] political views, or with views relatively conservative with respect to those of the national party. While such members of the Democratic Party can be found throughout the nation, actual elected officials are disproportionately found within the [[Southern United States|Southern states]] and to a lesser extent within [[Rural United States|rural]] regions of the United States generally, more commonly in the [[Western United States|West]]. Historically, [[Southern Democrats]] were generally much more ideologically conservative than conservative Democrats are now.
[[File:State Dining Room 2009.jpg|thumb|right|President [[Barack Obama]] meeting with the [[Blue Dog Coalition]] in the [[State Dining Room of the White House]] in 2009]]

Many conservative Southern Democrats defected to the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], beginning with the passage of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] and the general leftward shift of the party. [[Strom Thurmond]] of [[South Carolina]], [[Billy Tauzin]] of [[Louisiana]], [[Kent Hance]] and [[Ralph Hall]] of [[Texas]] and [[Richard Shelby]] of [[Alabama]] are examples of this. The influx of conservative Democrats into the Republican Party is often cited as a reason for the Republican Party's shift further to the right during the late 20th century as well as the shift of its base from the Northeast and Midwest to the South.

Into the 1980s, the Democratic Party had a conservative element, mostly from the South and Border regions. Their numbers declined sharply as the Republican Party built up its Southern base. They were sometimes humorously called "[[Yellow dog Democrat]]s", or "[[Boll weevil (politics)|boll weevils]]" and "[[Dixiecrats]]." In the [[United States House of Representatives|House]], they form the [[Blue Dog Coalition]], a caucus of conservatives and centrists willing to broker compromises with the Republican leadership. They have acted as a unified voting bloc in the past, giving its members some ability to change legislation, depending on their numbers in Congress.

[[Split-ticket voting]] was common among conservative Southern Democrats in the 1970s and 1980s. These voters supported conservative Democrats for local and statewide office while simultaneously voting for Republican presidential candidates.<ref>Roger Chapman, ''Culture Wars: An Encyclopedia'' (2010) vol 1 Page 136</ref>

A large majority of liberals favor moving toward [[universal health care]], with many supporting a [[single-payer health care|single-payer system]]. A majority also favor [[diplomacy]] over [[war|military action]], [[stem cell|stem cell research]], the legalization of [[same-sex marriage]], stricter [[Gun politics in the United States|gun control]] and environmental protection laws as well as the preservation of [[pro-choice|abortion rights]]. Immigration and [[cultural diversity]] are deemed positive as liberals favor [[cultural pluralism]], a system in which immigrants retain their native culture in addition to adopting their new culture. They tend to be divided on [[free trade]] agreements such as the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA) and organizations, with some seeing them as more favorable to corporations than workers.

Furthermore, Democrats see social services as essential towards providing [[Positive liberty|positive freedom]], freedom derived from economic opportunity. The Democratic-led House of Representatives reinstated the [[PAYGO]] (pay-as-you-go) budget rule at the start of the [[110th United States Congress|110th Congress]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Day Two: House passes new budget rules|date=January 5, 2007|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/16487187|agency=Associated Press|accessdate=January 5, 2007|archive-date=December 4, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191204034031/http://www.nbcnews.com/id/16487187|url-status=live}}</ref>

==== Minimum wage ====
{{see also|Minimum wage in the United States}}
The Democratic Party favors raising the [[minimum wage]]. The [[Fair Minimum Wage Act of 2007]] was an early component of the Democrats' agenda during the [[110th United States Congress|110th Congress]]. In 2006, the Democrats supported six state ballot initiatives to increase the minimum wage and all six initiatives passed.<ref name="democrats.org">{{cite web|url=http://www.democrats.org/democratic-national-platform |title=The Democratic Party Platform |publisher=Democrats.org |accessdate=March 18, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140315234633/http://www.democrats.org/democratic-national-platform |archive-date=March 15, 2014}}</ref>

==== Health care ====
[[File:Obama signing health care-20100323.jpg|thumb|President Barack Obama signing the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] into law at the White House on March 23, 2010]]
Democrats call for "affordable and quality health care" and favor moving toward [[universal health care]] in a variety of forms to address rising healthcare costs. Some Democratic politicians favor a [[single-payer health care|single-payer program]] or [[Medicare for All]], while others prefer creating a [[public health insurance option]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Goodnough |first1=Abby |last2=Kaplan |first2=Thomas |title=Democrat vs. Democrat: How Health Care Is Dividing the Party |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/28/health/democratic-debate-healthcare.html |website=The New York Times |accessdate=July 22, 2020 |archive-date=July 22, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200722004441/https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/28/health/democratic-debate-healthcare.html |url-status=live}}</ref>

The [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]], signed into law by President [[Barack Obama]] on March 23, 2010, has been one of the most significant pushes for universal health care. As of December 2019, more than 20&nbsp;million Americans have gained health insurance under the Affordable Care Act.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Nova |first1=Annie |title=How the Affordable Care Act transformed our health-care system |url=https://www.cnbc.com/2019/12/29/how-the-affordable-care-act-transformed-the-us-health-care-system.html |website=CNBC |accessdate=July 22, 2020 |archive-date=July 27, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200727041849/https://www.cnbc.com/2019/12/29/how-the-affordable-care-act-transformed-the-us-health-care-system.html |url-status=live}}</ref>

==== Education ====
Democrats favor improving [[public education]] by raising school standards and reforming the [[Head Start (program)|Head Start program]]. They also support [[universal preschool]] and expanding access to primary education, including through [[charter schools]]. They call for addressing [[student loan]] debt and reforms to reduce college tuition.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/papers_pdf/101962.pdf |title=Moving America Forward 2012 Democratic National Platform |publisher=presidency.ucsb.edu |date=September 14, 2012 |accessdate=January 13, 2018 |archive-date=August 19, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180819093203/http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/papers_pdf/101962.pdf |url-status=live}}</ref> Other proposals have included tuition-free public universities and reform of [[standardized testing]]. Democrats have the long-term aim of having publicly funded college education with low tuition fees (like in much of Europe and Canada), which would be available to every eligible American student. Alternatively, they encourage expanding access to post-secondary education by increasing state funding for student financial aid such as [[Pell Grants]] and [[college tuition]] [[tax deductions]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Clinton Joins Key Senate Democrats to Release Report on "The College Cost Crunch"|date=June 28, 2006|url=http://clinton.senate.gov/news/statements/details.cfm?id=258005|work=clinton.senate.gov|accessdate=November 25, 2006|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061025234254/http://www.clinton.senate.gov/news/statements/details.cfm?id=258005|archive-date=October 25, 2006|df=mdy}}</ref>

Democrats believe that the government should protect the environment and have a history of [[environmentalism]]. In more recent years, this stance has emphasized [[renewable energy]] generation as the basis for an improved economy, greater [[national security]], and general environmental benefits.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.democrats.org/a/national/clean_environment/ |title=Agenda&nbsp;— Environment |accessdate=March 18, 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070315113030/http://www.democrats.org/a/national/clean_environment/ |archive-date=March 15, 2007}}</ref>

The Democratic Party also favors expansion of conservation lands and encourages open space and rail travel to relieve highway and airport congestion and improve air quality and economy as it "believe[s] that communities, environmental interests, and the government should work together to protect resources while ensuring the vitality of local economies. Once Americans were led to believe they had to make a choice between the economy and the environment. They now know this is a false choice".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ontheissues.org/Celeb/Democratic_Party_Environment.htm|title=Democratic Party on Environment|accessdate=October 24, 2007|archive-date=July 3, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190703223850/http://ontheissues.org/Celeb/Democratic_Party_Environment.htm|url-status=live}}</ref>

The foremost environmental concern of the Democratic Party is [[climate change]]. Democrats, most notably former Vice President [[Al Gore]], have pressed for stern regulation of [[greenhouse gas]]es. On October 15, 2007, Gore won the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] for his efforts to build greater knowledge about man-made [[climate change]] and laying the foundations for the measures needed to counteract it.<ref>{{cite magazine|author=John Nicols|title=Al Gore Wins Nobel Peace Prize|magazine=The Nation|date=October 12, 2007}}</ref>

==== Renewable energy and fossil fuels ====
Democrats have supported increased domestic [[renewable energy]] development, including wind and solar power farms, in an effort to reduce carbon pollution. The party's platform calls for an "all of the above" energy policy including clean energy, natural gas and domestic oil, with the desire of becoming energy independent.<ref name="democrats.org"/> The party has supported higher taxes on [[oil companies]] and increased regulations on [[coal power plant]]s, favoring a policy of reducing long-term reliance on [[fossil fuels]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.democrats.org/issues/energy_independence|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100920002824/http://www.democrats.org/issues/energy_independence|url-status=dead|archive-date=September 20, 2010|title=Energy Independence|work=Democrats.org}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2014/06/02/coal-state-democrats-to-obama-curb-emissions-um-no-thanks/|title=Coal state Democrats to Obama: Curb emissions?

==== Trade agreements ====
Many Democrats support [[fair trade]] policies when it comes to the issue of [[international trade]] agreements and some in the party have started supporting [[free trade]] in recent decades.<ref name="Rorty">Rorty, R. (1997). ''Achieving Our Country: Leftist Thought In Twentieth Century America''. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press. {{ISBN|0-674-00312-8}}</ref> In the 1990s, the Clinton administration and a number of prominent Democrats pushed through a number of agreements such as the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA).

=== Social issues ===
[[File:Shirley Chisholm.jpg|thumb|right|[[Shirley Chisholm]] was the first major-party African American candidate to run nationwide primary campaigns.]]
The modern Democratic Party emphasizes [[egalitarianism]] and [[social equality]] through liberalism. They support [[Voting rights in the United States|voting rights]] and [[minority rights]], including [[LGBT rights in the United States|LGBT rights]], [[multiculturalism]] and [[Secularism|religious secularism]]. A longstanding social policy is upholding [[civil rights]], which affect ethnic and racial minorities and includes voting rights, [[equal opportunity]] and [[racial equality]]. The party championed the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]], which for the first time outlawed segregation. Democrats made civil rights and [[anti-racism]] a core party philosophy. Carmines and Stimson say that "the Democratic Party appropriated racial liberalism and assumed federal responsibility for ending racial discrimination".<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Carmines |first1=Edward G. |last2=Stimson |first2=James A. |year=1982|title=Racial Issues and The Structure of Mass Belief Systems|journal=Journal of Politics|volume=44|issue=1|pages=2–20|jstor=2130281|doi=10.2307/2130281 |s2cid=154384761}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author1=Talmadge Anderson|author2=James Benjamin Stewart|title=Introduction to African American Studies: Transdisciplinary Approaches and Implications|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=49tXR1Ok6poC&pg=PA205|year=2007|publisher=Black Classic Press|page=205|isbn=9781580730396|access-date=April 28, 2020|archive-date=October 2, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201002180949/https://books.google.com/books?id=49tXR1Ok6poC&pg=PA205&hl=en|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Jeffrey M.

Ideological social elements in the party include [[cultural liberalism]], [[civil libertarianism]] and [[feminism]]. Other Democratic social policies are [[internationalism (politics)|internationalism]], [[Political positions of the Democratic Party#Immigration|openness to immigration]], [[electoral reform]] and women's [[reproductive rights]].

==== Equal opportunity ====
The Democratic Party supports [[equal opportunity]] for all Americans regardless of sex, age, race, ethnicity, [[sexual orientation]], [[gender identity]], religion, creed, or national origin. Many Democrats support [[affirmative action]] programs to further this goal. Democrats also strongly support the [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990|Americans with Disabilities Act]] to prohibit discrimination against people based on physical or mental disability. As such, the Democrats pushed as well the [[ADA Amendments Act of 2008]], a disability rights expansion that became law.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.democrats.org/issues/civil_rights|title=Civil Rights|work=Democrats.org|access-date=February 2, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140209053820/http://www.democrats.org/issues/civil_rights|archive-date=February 9, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>

==== Abortion and reproductive rights ====
{{see also|Abortion law in the United States}}
The Democratic Party believe that all women should have access to [[birth control]] and support public funding of contraception for poor women. In its national platforms from 1992 to 2004, the Democratic Party has called for [[abortion]] to be "safe, legal and rare"—namely, keeping it legal by rejecting laws that allow governmental interference in abortion decisions and reducing the number of abortions by promoting both knowledge of reproduction and contraception and incentives for adoption. The wording changed in the 2008 platform. When Congress voted on the [[Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act]] in 2003, Congressional Democrats were split, with a minority (including former [[Party leaders of the United States Senate|Senate Majority Leader]] [[Harry Reid]]) supporting the ban and the majority of Democrats opposing the legislation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ontheissues.org/HouseVote/Party_2003-530.htm|title=House Votes on 2003-530|publisher=Ontheissues.org|date=October 2, 2003|accessdate=March 18, 2014|archive-date=February 28, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140228171204/http://www.ontheissues.org/HouseVote/Party_2003-530.htm|url-status=live}}</ref>

The Democratic Party opposes attempts to reverse the 1973 Supreme Court decision ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'', which declared abortion covered by the constitutionally protected individual [[right to privacy]] under the [[Ninth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Ninth Amendment]]; and ''[[Planned Parenthood v. Casey]]'', which lays out the legal framework in which government action alleged to violate that right is assessed by courts. As a matter of the [[Privacy|right to privacy]] and of [[gender equality]], many Democrats believe all women should have the ability to choose to abort without governmental interference. They believe that each woman, conferring with her conscience, has the right to choose for herself whether abortion is morally correct.

Former [[Party leaders of the United States Senate|Senate Minority Leader]] [[Harry Reid]] was [[anti-abortion]] and former President [[Jimmy Carter]] has expressed his wish to see the Democratic Party becoming more [[Anti-abortion movements|pro-life]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2012/03/29/jimmy_carter_democratic_party_should_be_more_pro-life.html |title=Jimmy Carter: Democratic Party Should Be More Pro-Life, March 29, 2012 |access-date=March 9, 2019 |archive-date=October 26, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191026180216/https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2012/03/29/jimmy_carter_democratic_party_should_be_more_pro-life.html |url-status=live}}</ref> while former President [[Barack Obama]] and [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] [[Nancy Pelosi]] favor [[abortion rights]]. Groups such as [[Democrats for Life of America]] represent the anti-abortion [[political faction|faction]] of the party while groups such as [[EMILY's List]] represent the abortion rights [[political faction|faction]]. A ''[[Newsweek]]'' poll from October 2006 found that 25% of Democrats were anti-abortion while a 69% majority was in favor of abortion rights.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pollingreport.com/abortion.htm|title=Abortion|publisher=Pollingreport.com|accessdate=January 19, 2015|archive-date=May 4, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160504121402/http://www.pollingreport.com/abortion.htm|url-status=live}}</ref>

Many Democratic politicians have called for systematic reform of the immigration system such that residents that have [[Illegal immigration to the United States|come into the United States illegally]] have a pathway to legal citizenship. President Obama remarked in November 2013 that he felt it was "long past time to fix our broken immigration system", particularly to allow "incredibly bright young people" that came over as students to become full citizens.

==== LGBT rights ====
The Democratic Party is supportive of [[LGBT]] rights. Most support for [[same-sex marriage in the United States]] has come from Democrats. Support for same-sex marriage has increased in the past decade according to [[ABC News]]. An April 2009 ABC News/''Washington Post'' public opinion poll put support among Democrats at 62%<ref>{{cite news|url=https://abcnews.go.com/images/PollingUnit/1089a6HotButtonIssues.pdf|title=Changing Views on Social Issues|date=April 30, 2009|accessdate=May 14, 2009|archive-date=November 10, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101110130400/http://abcnews.go.com/images/PollingUnit/1089a6HotButtonIssues.pdf|url-status=live}}</ref> whereas a June 2008 ''[[Newsweek]]'' poll found that 42% of Democrats support same-sex marriage while 23% support [[civil union]]s or [[domestic partnership]] laws and 28% oppose any legal recognition at all.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pollingreport.com/civil.htm|title=Civil Rights|work=pollingreport.com|access-date=August 23, 2008|archive-date=April 28, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130428225441/http://www.pollingreport.com/civil.htm|url-status=live}}</ref> A broad majority of Democrats have supported other LGBT-related laws such as extending [[hate crime]] statutes, [[Employment Non-Discrimination Act|legally preventing discrimination against LGBT people in the workforce]] and repealing [[Don't ask, don't tell]].

==== Puerto Rico ====
The 2016 Democratic Party platform declares: "We are committed to addressing the extraordinary challenges faced by our fellow citizens in Puerto Rico. Many stem from the fundamental question of Puerto Rico's political status. Democrats believe that the people of Puerto Rico should determine their ultimate political status from permanent options that do not conflict with the Constitution, laws, and policies of the United States. Democrats are committed to promoting economic opportunity and good-paying jobs for the hardworking people of Puerto Rico. We also believe that Puerto Ricans must be treated equally by Medicare, Medicaid, and other programs that benefit families. Puerto Ricans should be able to vote for the people who make their laws, just as they should be treated equally. All American citizens, no matter where they reside, should have the right to vote for the President of the United States. Finally, we believe that federal officials must respect Puerto Rico's local self-government as laws are implemented and Puerto Rico's budget and debt are restructured so that it can get on a path towards stability and prosperity".<ref name = "2016platform">{{cite web|url=https://www.demconvention.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Democratic-Party-Platform-7.21.16-no-lines.pdf|title=Democratic Party Platform 2016|accessdate=November 11, 2016|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161110225904/https://www.demconvention.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Democratic-Party-Platform-7.21.16-no-lines.pdf|archive-date=November 10, 2016|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

=== Legal issues ===

==== Gun control ====
With a stated goal of reducing crime and homicide, the Democratic Party has introduced various [[Gun politics in the United States|gun control]] measures, most notably the [[Gun Control Act of 1968]], the [[Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act|Brady Bill]] of 1993 and Crime Control Act of 1994. However, some Democrats, especially rural, Southern, and Western Democrats, favor fewer restrictions on firearm possession and warned the party was defeated in the 2000 presidential election in rural areas because of the issue.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Abramsky |first=Sasha |title=Democrat Killer? |magazine=[[The Nation]] |date=April 18, 2005 |url=http://www.thenation.com/doc/20050418/abramsky |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050930082519/http://www.thenation.com/doc/20050418/abramsky |archive-date=September 30, 2005 |accessdate=October 10, 2006}}</ref> In the national platform for 2008, the only statement explicitly favoring gun control was a plan calling for renewal of the 1994 [[Federal Assault Weapons Ban|Assault Weapons Ban]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.queerty.com/wp/docs/2008/08/2008-democratic-platform-080808.pdf|title=THE DRAFT 2008 DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL PLATFORM: RENEWING AMERICA'S PROMISE|accessdate=February 4, 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120512191810/http://www.queerty.com/wp/docs/2008/08/2008-democratic-platform-080808.pdf|archive-date=May 12, 2012}}</ref>

==== Death penalty ====
The Democratic Party supports the [[death penalty]] far less than the Republican Party. Although most Democrats in Congress have never seriously moved to overturn the rarely used [[Capital punishment by the United States federal government|federal death penalty]], both [[Russ Feingold]] and [[Dennis Kucinich]] have introduced such bills with little success. Democrats have led efforts to overturn state death penalty laws, particularly in [[New Jersey#Capital punishment|New Jersey]] and in [[New Mexico]]. They have also sought to prevent the reinstatement of the death penalty in those states which prohibit it, including Massachusetts and [[New York (state)#Capital punishment|New York]]. During the [[Presidency of Bill Clinton|Clinton administration]], Democrats led the expansion of the federal death penalty. These efforts resulted in the passage of the [[Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996]], signed into law by [[Bill Clinton|President Clinton]], which heavily limited appeals in death penalty cases.

In 1992, 1993 and 1995, Democratic Texas Congressman [[Henry B. Gonzalez|Henry González]] unsuccessfully introduced the [[s:Death Penalty Abolition Amendment|Death Penalty Abolition Amendment]] which prohibited the use of [[capital punishment in the United States]]. Democratic Missouri Congressman [[Bill Clay|William Lacy Clay, Sr.]] cosponsored the amendment in 1993.

During his [[Illinois Senate career of Barack Obama|Illinois Senate career]], former [[President of the United States|President]] [[Barack Obama]] successfully introduced legislation intended to reduce the likelihood of [[Miscarriage of justice|wrongful convictions]] in capital cases, requiring videotaping of confessions. When [[Barack Obama 2008 presidential campaign|campaigning for the presidency]], Obama stated that he supports the limited use of the death penalty, including for people who have been convicted of raping a minor under the age of 12, having opposed the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]]'s ruling in ''[[Kennedy v. Louisiana]]'' that the death penalty was unconstitutional in child rape cases.<ref>[http://www.newser.com/story/30953/obama-backs-death-penalty-for-child-rapists.html "Obama Backs Death Penalty for Child Rapists"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090527012457/http://www.newser.com/story/30953/obama-backs-death-penalty-for-child-rapists.html |date=May 27, 2009}}. [[Newser]], June 26, 2008. Retrieved June 10, 2009.</ref> Obama has stated that he thinks the "death penalty does little to deter crime" and that it is used too frequently and too inconsistently.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Candidates on the Death Penalty|url=http://pewforum.org/religion08/compare.php?Issue=Death_Penalty|accessdate=July 26, 2009|publisher=[[Pew Research Center]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704020036/http://pewforum.org/religion08/compare.php?Issue=Death_Penalty |archive-date=July 4, 2008}}</ref>

In June 2016, the Democratic Platform Drafting Committee unanimously adopted an amendment to abolish the death penalty, marking the first time the party had done so in its history.<ref>{{cite web|title=Democratic Platform Drafting Meeting Concludes|url=https://demconvention.com/news/democratic-platform-drafting-meeting-concludes/|date=June 25, 2016|accessdate=June 29, 2016|publisher=DNCC|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://archive.today/20160802094026/https://demconvention.com/news/democratic-platform-drafting-meeting-concludes/|archive-date=August 2, 2016|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

==== Torture ====
Many Democrats are opposed to the [[Torture and the United States|use of torture]] against individuals apprehended and held prisoner by the [[United States armed forces|United States military]] and hold that categorizing such prisoners as [[unlawful combatant]]s does not release the United States from its obligations under the [[Geneva Conventions]]. Democrats contend that torture is inhumane, damages the United States' moral standing in the world, and produces questionable results. Democrats are largely against [[waterboarding]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Tyson |first1=Alec |title=Americans divided in views of use of torture in U.S. anti-terror efforts |url=https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/01/26/americans-divided-in-views-of-use-of-torture-in-u-s-anti-terror-efforts/ |accessdate=March 21, 2020 |date=January 26, 2017 |archive-date=March 21, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200321214249/https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/01/26/americans-divided-in-views-of-use-of-torture-in-u-s-anti-terror-efforts/ |url-status=live}}</ref>

==== Patriot Act ====
Many Democrats are opposed to the [[Patriot Act]], but when the law was passed most Democrats were supportive of it and all but two Democrats in the Senate voted for the original Patriot Act legislation in 2001. The lone nay vote was from [[Russ Feingold]] of [[Wisconsin]] as [[Mary Landrieu]] of [[Louisiana]] did not vote.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=107&session=1&vote=00313 |title=Senate roll call on passage of the PATRIOT Act |publisher=Senate.gov |date=April 25, 2017 |accessdate=January 13, 2018 |archive-date=December 5, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171205074052/https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=107&session=1&vote=00313 |url-status=live}}</ref> In the House, the Democrats voted for the Act by 145 yea and 62 nay.

==== Privacy ====
The Democratic Party believes that individuals should have a [[privacy law|right to privacy]]. For example, many Democrats have opposed the [[NSA warrantless surveillance (2001–07)|NSA warrantless surveillance of American citizens]].

Some Democratic officeholders have championed [[consumer protection]] laws that limit the sharing of consumer data between corporations. Most Democrats oppose [[Sodomy laws in the United States|sodomy laws]] and believe that government should not regulate consensual noncommercial sexual conduct among adults as a matter of personal privacy.<ref>{{cite news|last=Ashtari|first=Shadee|title=Here's The Medieval-Sounding Sodomy Law That Helped Ken Cuccinelli Lose In Virginia|url=https://huffingtonpost.com/2013/11/06/ken-cuccinelli-sodomy_n_4226708.html|work=Huffington Post|date=November 6, 2013|access-date=December 6, 2019|archive-date=March 24, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190324035215/https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/11/06/ken-cuccinelli-sodomy_n_4226708.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

=== Foreign policy issues ===
The foreign policy of the voters of the two major parties has largely overlapped since the 1990s. A Gallup poll in early 2013 showed broad agreement on the top issues, albeit with some divergence regarding human rights and international cooperation through agencies such as the United Nations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/160649/republicans-democrats-agree-top-foreign-policy-goals.aspx|title=Republicans, Democrats Agree on Top Foreign Policy Goals|work=Gallup.com|accessdate=April 16, 2017|archive-date=March 10, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160310130915/http://www.gallup.com/poll/160649/republicans-democrats-agree-top-foreign-policy-goals.aspx|url-status=live}}</ref>

In June 2014, the Quinnipiac Poll asked Americans which foreign policy they preferred:

{{quote|A) The United States is doing too much in other countries around the world, and it is time to do less around the world and focus more on our own problems here at home.

B) The United States must continue to push forward to promote democracy and freedom in other countries around the world because these efforts make our own country more secure.}}

Democrats chose A over B by 65% to 32%; Republicans chose A over B by 56% to 39%; and independents chose A over B by 67% to 29%.<ref>See "July 3, 2014 - Iraq - Getting In Was Wrong; Getting Out Was Right, U.S. Voters Tell Quinnipiac University National Poll" [http://www.quinnipiac.edu/news-and-events/quinnipiac-university-poll/national/release-detail?ReleaseID=2057 Quinnipiac University Poll] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160402190652/http://www.quinnipiac.edu/news-and-events/quinnipiac-university-poll/national/release-detail?ReleaseID=2057 |date=April 2, 2016}} item #51</ref>

==== Iraq War ====
{{see also|Iraq War}}
[[File:Barack Obama 2008 Iraq 19.jpg|thumb|right|160px|President [[Barack Obama]] shaking hands with an American soldier in [[Basra]], [[Iraq]] in 2008]]
In 2002, Congressional Democrats were divided on the [[Iraq Resolution|Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq]]: 147 voted against it (21 in the Senate and 126 in the House) and 110 voted for it (29 in the Senate and 81 in the House). Since then, many prominent Democrats, such as former senator [[John Edwards]], have expressed regret about this decision and have called it a mistake while others, such as Senator [[Hillary Clinton]], have criticized the conduct of the war yet not repudiated their initial vote for it (though Clinton later went on to repudiate her stance during the 2008 primaries). Referring to Iraq, [[Party leaders of the United States Senate|Senate Majority Leader]] [[Harry Reid]] declared in April 2007 the war to be "lost" while other Democrats (especially during the 2004 presidential election cycle) accused the President of lying to the public about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.

The 2008 Democratic Party platform acknowledges a "[[special relationship]] with Israel, grounded in shared interests and shared values, and a clear, strong, fundamental commitment to the security of Israel, our strongest ally in the region and its only established democracy." It also included:

<blockquote>It is in the best interests of all parties, including the United States, that we take an active role to help secure a lasting settlement of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict with a democratic, viable Palestinian state dedicated to living in peace and security side by side with the Jewish State of Israel. To do so, we must help Israel identify and strengthen those partners who are truly committed to peace while isolating those who seek conflict and instability, and stand with Israel against those who seek its destruction. The United States and its Quartet partners should continue to isolate Hamas until it renounces terrorism, recognizes Israel's right to exist, and abides by past agreements. Sustained American leadership for peace and security will require patient efforts and the personal commitment of the President of the United States. The creation of a Palestinian state through final status negotiations, together with an international compensation mechanism, should resolve the issue of Palestinian refugees by allowing them to settle there, rather than in Israel. All understand that it is unrealistic to expect the outcome of final status negotiations to be a full and complete return to the armistice lines of 1949. Jerusalem is and will remain the capital of Israel. The parties have agreed that Jerusalem is a matter for final status negotiations. It should remain an undivided city accessible to people of all faiths.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.democrats.org/a/party/platform.html |title=Renewing America's Promise: Democratic Party Platform, 2008 |publisher=Democrats.org |accessdate=June 17, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100616214838/http://www.democrats.org/a/party/platform.html |archive-date=June 16, 2010}}</ref></blockquote>

According to exit polling, [[LGBT Americans]] typically vote Democratic in national elections within the 70–80% range. In heavily gay precincts in large cities across the nation, the average was higher, ranging from 85 to 94%. This trend has continued since 1996 when Bill Clinton won 71% of the LGBT vote compared to Bob Dole's 16%. In 2000 Al Gore won 70% to George W. Bush's 25%, in 2004 John Kerry won 77% to George W. Bush's 23%, in 2008 Barack Obama won 70% to John McCain's 27%, and in 2012 Barack Obama won 76% to Mitt Romney's 22%, and in 2016 Hillary Clinton won 78% to Trump's 14%. In 2020 Joe Biden won 64% of the LGBT votes to Trump's 27%, the lowest in 24 years. Patrick Egan, a professor of politics at New York University specializing in LGBT voting patterns, calls this a "remarkable continuity", saying that "about three-fourths vote Democratic and one-fourth Republican from year to year".<ref name="press">{{cite web|url=http://www.law.ucla.edu/williamsinstitute/press/GaySupportForObamaSimilarToDemsInPastElections.html|title=Gay Support for Obama Similar to Dems in Past Elections|publisher=Law.ucla.edu|date=November 26, 2008|accessdate=June 17, 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091209021908/http://www.law.ucla.edu/williamsinstitute/press/GaySupportForObamaSimilarToDemsInPastElections.html|archive-date=December 9, 2009}}</ref> Notable LGBT Democrats include Senator [[Tammy Baldwin]] of Wisconsin, Senator [[Kyrsten Sinema]] of Arizona, Representative [[David Cicilline]] of Rhode Island, Governor [[Kate Brown]] of Oregon and Governor [[Jared Polis]] of Colorado.

=== Labor ===
[[File:Fig 109 - does someone in house belong to union.JPG|thumb|right|upright=1.7|Higher percentages of Democrats than Republicans are members of union households.]]
Since the 1930s, a critical component of the Democratic Party coalition has been [[Labor unions in the United States|organized labor]]. Labor unions supply a great deal of the money, [[Grassroots|grass roots]] [[Political organisation|political organization]] and voting base of support for the party. Democrats are far more likely to be represented by unions, although union membership has declined, in general, during the last few decades. This trend is depicted in the following graph from the book ''Democrats and Republicans—Rhetoric and Reality''.<ref>Fried, Joseph, ''Democrats and Republicans: Rhetoric and Reality'' (New York: Algora Publishing, 2008), 126.</ref> It is based on surveys conducted by the National Election Studies (NES).

The historic decline in union membership over the past half-century has been accompanied by a growing disparity between public sector and private sector union membership percentages. The three most significant labor groupings in the Democratic coalition today are the [[AFL-CIO]] and [[Change to Win Federation|Change to Win]] [[National trade union center|labor federations]] as well as the [[National Education Association]], a large, unaffiliated [[teacher|teachers']] union. Both the AFL-CIO and Change to Win have identified their top legislative priority for 2007 as passage of the [[Employee Free Choice Act]]. Other important issues for labor unions include supporting [[industrial policy]] (including [[protectionism]]) that sustains unionized [[manufacturing]] jobs, raising the [[minimum wage]] and promoting broad social programs such as [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] and [[universal health care]].

=== Working class ===
{{further|Social class in the United States}}
The [[American working class]] is a stronghold of the Democratic Party and continues to be an essential part of the Democratic base. Economic insecurity makes the majority of working-class people left-of-center on economic issues. However, many working class Democrats differ from liberals in their more socially conservative views. Working class Democrats tend to be more religious and more likely to belong to an ethnic minority. The continued importance of the working class manifests itself in exit polls, which show that the majority of those with working class [[Income in the United States|incomes]] and education vote for the Democratic Party.<ref name="CNN.
