'''Kweisi Mfume''' ({{IPAc-en|k|w|aɪ|ˈ|iː|s|i|_|ʊ|m|ˈ|f|uː|m|eɪ}} {{respell|kwy|EE|see|_|uum|FOO|may}}; born '''Frizzell Gerald Gray'''; October 24, 1948) is an American politician who is the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] for [[Maryland's 7th congressional district]], first serving from 1987 to 1996 and again since 2020. He first left his seat to become the [[president (corporate title)|president]] and [[chief executive officer|CEO]] of the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP), a position he held from 1996 to 2004. In [[2006 United States Senate election in Maryland|2006]], he ran for the [[U.S. Senate]] seat that was being vacated by [[Paul Sarbanes]], narrowly losing the Democratic primary election to [[Ben Cardin]].

==Early life and education==
Mfume was born as Frizzell Gerald Gray in [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]], on October 24, 1948, the eldest of four. His father, a truck driver, abandoned his family in Gray's youth. Upon the death of his mother, Mfume dropped out of high school at sixteen to begin working as many as three jobs at a time to support his three sisters. He also began hanging around street corners, including with gang members. 

In his 1996 autobiography, ''No Free Ride'', Mfume said that he "was locked up a couple of times on suspicion of theft because [he] happened to be black and happened to be young." Speculation as to the degree of his entanglement with the law has varied, especially as he later came into prominence. He became father to five children with several different women during his difficult teenage years. He has since adopted one child as well.<ref>{{cite news |first=Wiley |last=Hall |agency=[[Associated Press]] |title=NAACP president Mfume resigns |url=https://www.spokesman.com/stories/2004/dec/01/naacp-president-mfume-resigns/ |access-date=April 28, 2020 |date=December 1, 2004 |newspaper=[[The Spokesman-Review]] |location=[[Spokane, Washington]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=CNN.com - NAACP chief Mfume resigns - Nov 30, 2004 |url=https://www.cnn.com/2004/US/11/30/naacp.resigns/index.html |access-date=April 29, 2020 |work=CNN |date=November 30, 2004 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160313011539/http://www.cnn.com/2004/US/11/30/naacp.resigns/index.html |archive-date=March 13, 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref>

In 1978, Mfume was elected to the [[Baltimore City Council]],<ref>{{cite web |title=Our Campaigns - Candidate - Kweisi Mfume |url=https://www.ourcampaigns.com/CandidateDetail.html?CandidateID=9827 |website=Our Campaigns |access-date=April 29, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071217145540/http://www.ourcampaigns.com/CandidateDetail.html?CandidateID=9827 |archive-date=December 17, 2007 |url-status=live }}</ref> where he opposed mayor [[William Donald Schaefer]], whom he accused of ignoring the poor neighborhoods of the city. He was elected to the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] in 1986.

=== U.S. House of Representatives (1987–1996) ===
In November 1986, Mfume was elected to representing {{ushr|MD|7}}. He won re-election to four more terms.

Mfume made himself known as a Democrat with an apparent balance between strong progressive ideologies and a capacity for practical compromise, representing a district that included both West Baltimore and suburban and rural communities, though his primary goal was an increase in federal aid to American inner cities. In his fourth term he was made chairman of the [[Congressional Black Caucus]].{{cn|date=February 2020}}

=== NAACP ===
In February 1996, Mfume left the House to accept the presidency of the [[NAACP|National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP), stating that he could do more to improve American [[Civil and political rights|civil rights]] there than in the Congress.<ref>{{cite news |title=U.S. News Briefs |url=http://www.cnn.com/US/Newsbriefs/9602/02-20/ |work=[[CNN]] |access-date=April 29, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030206215807/http://www.cnn.com/US/Newsbriefs/9602/02-20/ |archive-date=February 6, 2003 |date=February 20, 1996 |url-status=live}}</ref> He reformed the association's finances to pay off its considerable debt while pursuing the cause of civil rights advancement for African Americans. Though many in Baltimore wanted Mfume to run for [[mayor]] in the [[1999 Baltimore mayoral election|1999 election]], he stayed with the NAACP.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/05/25/us/naacp-chief-rules-out-running-for-mayor-of-baltimore.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |title=N.A.A.C.P.

Mfume stepped down from his position at the NAACP in 2004 after an internal investigation of allegations that he had sexually harassed female subordinates.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.baltimoresun.com/maryland/bal-te.md.mfume08may08-story.html |newspaper=[[The Baltimore Sun]] |title=Pattern of abuse claims at NAACP kept quiet |first=Kelly |last=Brewington |date=May 8, 2005 |access-date=February 11, 2020}}</ref> Mfume acknowledged dating an NAACP employee, <ref>{{cite news |last1=Matthew Mosk |last2=Cheryl W.

On March 14, 2005, Mfume announced that he would seek the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]] seat of incumbent [[Paul Sarbanes]], following the announcement by Sarbanes that he would not run for re-election in 2006.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.wbaltv.com/article/civil-rights-leader-announces-bid-for-u-s-senate/7047984 |title=Civil Rights Leader Announces Bid For U.S. Senate |date=March 14, 2005 |work=[[WBAL-TV]] |access-date=January 15, 2017}}</ref> The Democratic primary for this seat was held on September 12, 2006, and Mfume lost the race to U.S. Representative [[Ben Cardin]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Cardin beats Mfume in Maryland Senate race |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/14808135/ns/politics/t/cardin-beats-mfume-maryland-senate-race/ |access-date=February 6, 2020 |work=[[NBC News]] |date=September 13, 2006 |language=en |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200309123018/http://www.nbcnews.com/id/14808135/ns/politics/t/cardin-beats-mfume-maryland-senate-race/ |archive-date=March 9, 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref>
