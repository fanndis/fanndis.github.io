'''Paris Whitney Hilton''' (born February 17, 1981)<ref name=filmref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/88/Paris-Hilton.html|title=Paris Hilton Biography (1981–)|publisher=FilmReference.com|access-date=January 2, 2018}}</ref> is an American media personality, businesswoman, socialite, model, singer, actress, and DJ. She is a great-granddaughter of [[Conrad Hilton]], the founder of [[Hilton Hotels & Resorts|Hilton Hotels]]. Born in New York City and raised there and in [[Beverly Hills, California]], Hilton began her modeling career as a teenager when she signed with New York-based modeling development agency [[Trump Model Management]]. [[David Lachapelle]] soon photographed her for the September 2000 issue of ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]].'' Her late-night persona and reputation as a [[socialite]] made her a fixture of tabloid journalism, and Hilton was proclaimed "New York's leading [[It Girl]]" in 2001.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/people/paris-hilton-11271420?page=1|title=Paris Hilton Biodata|publisher=Biography.com|access-date=August 10, 2012}}</ref> In 2003, a leaked 2001 [[Celebrity sex tape|sex tape]] with her then-boyfriend [[Rick Salomon]], later released as ''[[1 Night in Paris]]'', catapulted her into global fame, and the reality television series ''[[The Simple Life]]'', in which she starred with her friend and socialite counterpart [[Nicole Richie]], started its five-year run with 13 million viewers, on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]].

In 2004, Hilton published her book, ''[[Confessions of an Heiress]]'', which became a [[The New York Times Best Seller list|''New York Times'' Best Seller]], in 2005, she starred in the horror film ''[[House of Wax (2005 film)|House of Wax]],'' and in 2006, she released her self-titled debut studio album, ''[[Paris (Paris Hilton album)|Paris]],'' which reached number six on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], and respectively produced the successful single "[[Stars Are Blind]]". Hilton returned to reality television in 2008 with the [[Paris Hilton's My New BFF|''Paris Hilton's My New BFF'' franchise]], in 2011 with ''[[The World According to Paris]]'', and again in 2018 with ''[[Hollywood Love Story]]''. She has played small roles in Hollywood films and television series, produced several of her own projects, and recorded a line of standalone singles. She was also the subject of the documentaries ''[[Paris, Not France]]'' (2008), ''[[Teenage Paparazzo]]'' (2010), ''[[The American Meme]]'' (2018), and ''[[This Is Paris]]'' (2020). In 2012, Hilton made her debut as a [[Disc jockey|DJ]] at Brazil's Pop Music Festival. She held her own residence at the [[Amnesia (nightclub)|Amnesia nightclub]] in [[Ibiza]] between 2013 and 2017, was the highest-paid female DJ in 2014,<ref name="time.com">{{cite news|url=http://time.com/4964680/dj-paris-hilton-ibiza/|title=Here's What Happened When We Went Clubbing with DJ Paris Hilton|website=Time}}</ref> and has performed at various festivals, such as [[Summerfest]] and [[Tomorrowland]].

She appeared in the 2007 ''[[Guinness World Records]]'' as the Most Overrated Celebrity, while ''[[Forbes]]'' included her in its [[Forbes Celebrity 100|Celebrity 100]] in 2004, 2005 and 2006, and ranked her as one of the Most Overexposed Celebrities in 2012. Critics indeed suggest that she exemplifies the [[celebutante]]—a celebrity not through talent or work, but through inherited wealth and lavish lifestyle. Hilton has parlayed her media fame into an eponymous brand, which includes 19 product lines, 50 boutiques worldwide, and a [[Azure Beach Club Paris Hilton|club resort]] in [[Manila]], Philippines. Her [[list of celebrity-branded perfumes|perfume line]] alone has brought in over US$3 billion in revenue to date.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.netflix.com/us-es/title/81003741|title=The American Meme - Sitio oficial de Netflix|website=www.netflix.com}}</ref><ref name="pearns">{{cite news|title=Surprise?

===Persona===
[[File:Paris Hilton at Sundance Film Festival 2008.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Hilton at the 2008 [[Sundance Film Festival]]]] 
Much of her image has centered on her "party girl-heiress archetype" as well as her blonde hair and the stereotypes associated with it, especially dumbness, naïveté, sexual availability and artificiality.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dazeddigital.com/film-tv/article/42648/1/paris-hilton-the-american-meme-existential-dread|title=Paris Hilton grapples with the futility of life in The American Meme|last=Dazed|date=December 19, 2018|website=Dazed}}</ref> The development of that character stemmed from the initial success of ''The Simple Life'' and her desire to embody "the ultimate brand based on [...] the right everything for a formula that far exceeded anybody else at that time", according to Jason Moore, her former manager.<ref name="cnnph">{{cite news|url=https://www.cnn.com/2011/11/02/showbiz/celebrity-news-gossip/jason-moore-on-paris-hilton/index.html|title=The man who 'made' Paris Hilton|author=Abbey Goodman, Special to|website=CNN}}</ref> He stated: "She was the ultimate package that corporate America would want to make for itself as a marketing tool, but it was already made for them. They say to be a famous person, people want to be you or [sleep with you], and she encompassed both of those".<ref name="cnnph" />

Fashion and language are two contributing factors to Hilton's star image. Besides her long bleached blonde hair, [[valley girl]] accent, and use of blue coloured contact lenses over her naturally brown eyes, she developed her personal aesthetic through [[Juicy Couture]] tracksuits, rhinestones, trucker hats, oversized sunglasses, and the "accessory dog". She mimed "high-fashion poses learned from [[drag queens]]" and created what was described as the "Paris talk". For instance, she often uses one-liners and a breathy, childish voice in television shows and interviews.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/paris-hilton-reveals-the-origin-of-her-baby-voice-w159305/|title=Paris Hilton Reveals the Origin of Her Baby Voice!|date=December 9, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.today.com/popculture/paris-hilton-her-voice-fragrance-line-how-reality-tv-has-t102840|title=What 'Simple Life' fans never knew about Paris Hilton: That's not her voice|website=TODAY.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2006/jul/08/popandrock|title=Simon Hattenstone meets Paris Hilton|first=Simon|last=Hattenstone|date=July 7, 2006|via=www.theguardian.com|newspaper=The Guardian}}</ref>

Although her dim-witted blonde persona was a carefully crafted act, the general public believed it to be her real personality, and that became an obstacle in her career, when she wanted to be respected as a businesswoman. She remarked: "People assume before they meet me that I'm a really ditzy dumb blonde. That's the one thing that kind of annoys me sometimes. They just think because of the reality show that's who I really am. But that was just a character that I created. I didn't realize what a huge success [it would be...] With everything that's happening, though, with my business, I think people can understand that you couldn't possibly get this far being a dumb blonde".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/paris-hilton-on-being-recognized-as-a-ditzy-dumb-blonde-it-annoys-me|title=Paris Hilton on being recognized as a 'ditzy dumb blonde': 'It annoys me'|first=Stephanie|last=Nolasco|date=July 17, 2017|website=Fox News}}</ref>

The unusual nature and extent of her fame is often questioned by critics, as she is not considered an entertainer nor performer. One writer for the ''ABC News'' noted: "She's made a lot of money with a hodgepodge of traditional celebrity revenue [...] But what she's best at is being Paris Hilton".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/story?id=3270428&page=1|title=Who Will Be the Next Paris Hilton?|date=June 13, 2007|website=ABC News}}</ref> Writers indeed suggest that Hilton epitomizes the ''[[celebutante]]'': a celebrity for no particularly identifiable reason other than inherited wealth and lavish lifestyle. ''Refinery29'', describing her, asserted: "Paris Hilton is an icon not just of the 2000s, but of a certain widely held image of what inherited wealth, undeserved fame, and American excess looks like".<ref name="mag29">{{cite web|url=https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/heiress-self-made-paris-hilton-200000651.html|title=Can An Heiress Be Self-Made?

==="That's hot" catchphrase===
The catchphrase "'''That's hot'''" is Hilton's signature line.<ref name="hot n not">{{cite book |first=Katarina |last=Rasulić |year=2015 |chapter=What's Hot and What's Not in English and Serbian |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_PyADQAAQBAJ&q=%22Paris+Hilton%22+%22that%27s+hot%22+signature&pg=PA290 |title=The Linguistics of Temperature |editor=Maria Koptjevskaja-Tamm |publisher=[[John Benjamins Publishing Company]] |location=[[Amsterdam]], Netherlands |page=290 |issn=0167-7373 |isbn=978-90-272-0688-6 |lccn=2014035097 }}</ref> The catchphrase is also registered as a trademark for products, like clothing apparel, electronic devices, and alcoholic beverages.<ref name="hot n not"/>

On September 6, 2007, Hilton filed an [[injunction]] lawsuit against [[Hallmark Cards]] Inc., titled ''Hilton v. Hallmark Cards'', in [[U.S. District Court]] over the unlawful use of her picture and catchphrase "That's hot" on a greeting card. The card is titled "Paris's First Day as a Waitress" with a photograph of Hilton's face on a cartoon of a waitress serving a plate of food, with a dialogue bubble saying "Don't touch that, it's hot" (which had a [[registered trademark]] on February 13, 2007). Hilton's attorney Brent Blakely said that the [[Copyright infringement|infringement]] damages would be based on profits from the greeting cards. Julie O'Dell said that Hallmark used the card as [[parody]], protected under [[fair use]] law.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.thesmokinggun.com/documents/celebrity/paris-hilton-sues-over-hallmark-card | title=Paris Hilton Sues Over Hallmark Card | work=The Smoking Gun | date=September 7, 2007 | access-date=December 12, 2008}}</ref> The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]] reviewed the case and "denied Hallmark's motion to dismiss".

===Re-invention===

In September 2020, 39-year-old Hilton gave interviews in which she said she planned to re-invent her public image.<ref name=nytimes2020-09-12/> She said she was not a "dumb blonde", merely someone able to present herself as one, and that she wanted to start presenting herself as a serious person who had achieved success through hard work.{{citation needed|date=September 2020}}

==Impact==
In 2011, two years after the apparent end of Hilton's media dominance, ''CNN'' declared that she had transformed fame "more than any other modern-day star",<ref name="cnnph"/> in reference to her influence on the revival of the [[famous for being famous]] phenomenon, and leadership in the insurgency of a new type of celebrity, whose private life became an unprecedented focus of public interest.<ref name="phfame" /> She is credited with creating the professional blueprint for this kind of celebrity, which intensified with the posterior growth of social media,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wmagazine.com/story/paris-hilton-interview|title=Paris Hilton Invented Everything You're Doing in 2017, and She Knows It|first=Mayan Toledano, Emilia|last=Petrarca|website=W Magazine}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.harpersbazaar.com.sg/life/paris-hiltons-most-memorable-moments/|title=We Bet That You Forgot Paris Hilton Once Did All These Things|first=Syed Zulfadhli 17|last=February 2017|date=February 17, 2017|website=Harper's Bazaar Singapore}}</ref> and molding what academic [[Daniel J.

''Paper Magazine'' called Hilton "the mother of the digital age" in a 2018 article, explaining that throughout her life, "she's attracted the world to monitor her every move —her platinum blonde hair flips, her hot pink velour sweatsuits, her famous fleet of chihuahuas— and yet, Hilton didn't do anything to deserve this attention beyond simply being herself.

===Sex tape===
In 2003, a [[celebrity sex tape|sex tape]] featuring Hilton and then-boyfriend Rick Salomon was leaked onto the Internet shortly after the debut of her mainstream TV series ''[[The Simple Life]]''. Salomon filed a lawsuit against the company that distributed the tape, and against the Hilton family, whom he accused of tarnishing his reputation by suggesting that he had exploited Hilton.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,544778,00.html|title=Shame Game |last=Hiatt|first=Brian |date=November 18, 2003|publisher=ew.com|access-date=December 7, 2008}}</ref> Hilton later sued the company that released the tape, Kahatani Ltd., for $30 million for violation of privacy and emotional distress.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2004/TECH/internet/02/09/paris.lawsuit.reut/|title=Paris Hilton sues over Internet sex tape|date=February 9, 2004|publisher=cnn.com|access-date=December 7, 2008}}</ref>

Under the title ''[[1 Night in Paris]]'', Salomon began distributing the tape himself in April 2004 through the adult film company [[Red Light District Video]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,630669,00.html|title=X-Rated Paris Tape Goes to Home Video|last=Silverman|first=Stephen M. |date=April 30, 2004|publisher=people.com|access-date=December 7, 2008}}</ref> In July 2004, Salomon dropped his lawsuit against the Hilton family after Paris Hilton's privacy lawsuit was thrown out of court.

In October 2010, James Rainford bicycled past guards at the entrance to her gated community, went to her house, and began pounding on her door. He was arrested and earned three years' probation, along with a restraining order from Hilton. In April 2011, Rainford was arrested a second time for attacking her boyfriend Cy Waits outside Van Nuys Superior Court, where Hilton was headed to testify against Nathan Lee Parada, and he was arrested again in July outside her [[Malibu, California]] beach house.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/paris-hiltons-accused-stalker-to-stand-trial/|title=Paris Hilton's accused stalker to stand trial}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://latimesblogs.latimes.com/gossip/2011/07/paris-hilton-stalker-intruder-james-rainford-cy-waits.html|title=Paris Hilton stalker James Rainford arrested again, outside her Malibu home|date=July 5, 2011}}</ref> He was charged with two felony stalking counts and three misdemeanor counts of disobeying a court order,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/man-is-charged-with-stalking-paris-hilton/|title=Man is charged with stalking Paris Hilton}}</ref> but a judge found him to be "mentally incompetent to stand trial" and he was sent to a state mental hospital.

In 2014, an "obsessed fan" flew a plane over Malibu with two banners, one of which read, "Can't Get Paris Whitney Hilton Out of My Mind." The other read, "Mr. & Mrs. Hilton, may I court your daughter Paris?" In 2015, the same person reportedly posed as a flower deliveryman to gain access to her gated community, where he left her a classic [[Cadillac]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tmz.com/2015/02/26/paris-hilton-stalker-new-car-obsessed-fan-bought-cadillac-gift/|title=Paris Hilton -- Obsessed Fan Gets Crazy with Classic Caddy|website=TMZ}}</ref>

Between 2015 and 2017, Hilton was the target of an identity theft scheme by Paytsar Bkhchadzhyan, a woman who used Hilton's credit cards to book a party at the [[Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel]] worth around $53,000. She also pretended to be Hilton in emails to her employees, convincing them to transfer $106,000 to her account, and hacked her sister Nicky and father Rick Hilton in an attempt to gain passwords to various other accounts. She also stole nude photos of Hilton from her [[iCloud]] account.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tmz.com/2018/05/04/paris-hilton-hacker-nude-photos-money-stolen-sentencing/|title=Hacker Hit Paris Hilton for $130k and Obtained Nude Photos|website=TMZ}}</ref> Bkhchadzhyan was arrested in 2017 for bank fraud conspiracy, and was later sentenced to 57 months in prison and ordered to pay restitution.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPJ4_nIHaPA|title=Paris Hilton Comes Face to Face With Her Hacker in Court - TMZ|last=TMZ|date=May 7, 2018|via=YouTube}}</ref>
