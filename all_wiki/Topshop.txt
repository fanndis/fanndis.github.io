==History==
[[File:Topshop Oxford Street London 2009.jpg|thumb|Topshop's flagship shop in [[Oxford Street]], London]]
Topshop started as a brand extension of the department store [[Peter Robinson (department store)|Peter Robinson]] in the 1960s and originally sold fashion by young British designers, such as [[Mary Quant]] and [[Stirling Cooper]]. Peter Robinson was a women's fashion chain that had been acquired by [[Burton (clothing)|Burton]] in 1946.<ref name="Guardian Brewerton">{{cite news|last1=Brewerton|first1=David|title=Raymond Burton obituary|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/mar/15/raymond-burton-obituary|accessdate=3 November 2014|publisher=The Guardian|date=15 March 2011}}</ref> Topshop was founded in 1964 as ''Peter Robinson's Top Shop'', a youth brand within the [[Sheffield]] branch and also had a large department in the [[Oxford Street]] shop. This was high fashion for the "young and different generation" as ''[[The Times]]'' put it in 1965, and the department stocked garments by names such as Mary Quant and [[Gerald McCann (fashion designer)|Gerald McCann]].<ref name="The Times 56365">{{cite news|title=Devoted to Women: Reduced Guide to the Sales – II|issue=56365|work=The Times|date=5 July 1965|ref=13}}</ref><ref name="V&A McCann">{{cite web|title=Gerald McCann|url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/g/gerald-mccann-1931/|website=vam.ac.uk|publisher=Victoria & Albert Museum|accessdate=4 November 2014}}</ref> By 1966, it had a branch in the Peter Robinson store in [[Norwich]].<ref name="The Times 56791">{{cite news|title=The London Look in Norwich|issue=56791|work=The Times|date=17 November 1966}}</ref>

Peter Robinson's Top Shop buyer Diane Wadey had an eye for young talent and introduced [[Royal College of Art]] graduate Jane Whiteside to Jeff Cooper and Ronnie Stirling – the Stirling Cooper brand they created soon had its own sections in Top Shop shops in London and Sheffield, as well as being stocked in Peter Robinson stores in Norwich and [[Bristol]].<ref name="The Times 57192">{{cite news|last1=Glynn|first1=Prudence|title=Long skirts at short prices|issue=57192|work=The Times|date=5 March 1968}}</ref><ref name="The Times 57292">{{cite news|title=Bargain Time|issue=57292|work=The Times|date=2 July 1968}}</ref> Other brands stocked at Top Shop included [[Jeff Banks]], [[French Connection (clothing)|French Connection]] and [[Alfred Radley|Radley Cooper]].<ref name="The Times 60340">{{cite news|last1=Stone|first1=Margaret|title=All weather clothes of all work|issue=60340|work=The Times|date=29 June 1978}}</ref>

===Launch of separate retail chain===
In 1973, parent company Burton Group launched a major expansion of its womenswear division, splitting Top Shop by Peter Robinson into two chains to be known as Peter Robinson and Top Shop. It was announced that while Peter Robinson would target the over 25s market, Top Shop would focus on the age range from 13 to 24, with [[Ralph Halpern]] directing the new venture.<ref name="The Times 58702">{{cite news|title=Burton set for drive in womenswear|issue=58702|work=The Times|date=8 February 1973|ref=pg. 25}}</ref> By 1974, Peter Robinson had been reduced from 22 stores to six, while Top Shop was developing independently (still retaining the one co-branded shop in Oxford Street) and was described as "highly profitable". Its key retail rivals included [[Miss Selfridge]] and the Way In boutique arm of [[Harrods]].<ref name="The Times 59113">{{cite news|title=Why the stores are slimming down|issue=59113|work=The Times|date=12 June 1974|ref=pg. 23}}</ref> Within two years, Top Shop had 55 standalone branches, with more to come according to an article in ''The Times''. Fashion editor [[Prudence Glynn]] described it as having a: "sharp definition of purpose".<ref name="The Times 59532">{{cite news|last1=Glynn|first1=Prudence|title=A success in all sizes|issue=59532|work=The Times|date=21 October 1975|ref=pg. 11}}</ref> It made profits of £1m that year.<ref name="The Times 59868">{{cite news|title=Business Diary|issue=59868|work=The Times|date=23 November 1976|ref=pg. 19}}</ref> By 1978, Top Shop accounted for a third of Burton's operating profits.<ref name="The Times 60299">{{cite news|last1=Financial Editor|title=Burton Group: On the button|issue=60299|work=The Times|date=12 May 1978|ref=pg. 23}}</ref>

Also in 1978, Burton embarked on a drive to win a larger share of the men's fashion market in the midst of declining sales of men's tailoring, launching the [[Topman]] brand along similar lines to its women's retail arm. It was described by an executive as: "more of a 'brother to Top Shop than a son of Burton'."<ref name="The Times 60267">{{cite news|last1=Tisdall|first1=Patricia|title=Burton and Hepworth in drive for larger share of menswear sales|issue=60267|work=The Times|date=4 April 1978|ref=pg. 17}}</ref> The following year, Burton announced sales and profits up by 30 percent in womenswear, with Topman also being cited as highly profitable.<ref name="The Times 60503">{{cite news|title=Tickets to success for the Burton Group in 1979 (investor ad)|issue=60503|work=The Times|date=18 December 1979|ref=display advertising}}</ref> By the start of the 1980s, the brand was being referred to as Topshop.<ref name="The Times 60479">{{cite news|last1=Unsworth|first1=Rosemary|title=Fashion groups hoping for a recovery: waiting for a golden Christmas|issue=60479|work=The Times|date=20 November 1979|ref=pg.22}}</ref>

===1980s and beyond===
In the 1980s, Topshop struggled to maintain its profile as a fashion brand, but by the late 1990s it began undergoing a revival. The brand pioneered online fashion, launching UK's first online fashion store for Topshop <ref>{{cite web|title= Topshop launches Zoom fashion portal|url=https://www.investegate.co.uk/ArticlePrint.aspx?id=199907260750369767N }}</ref><ref name="BBC British Style Genius">{{cite news|title=Topshop Oxford Street|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/britishstylegenius/content/21798.shtml|accessdate=3 November 2014|work=British Style Genius|publisher=BBC|date=2009}}</ref> This turnaround is often credited to the promotion of [[Jane Shepherdson]] as brand director.<ref name="The Observer Vernon">{{cite news|last1=Vernon|first1=Polly|title=Jane Shepherdson|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2008/mar/09/fashion.women2|accessdate=3 November 2014|publisher=The Observer|date=9 March 2008}}</ref> Having begun her career as a buyer, she rose through the ranks at the company. When she took on brand direction, Topshop had an annual profit of £9 million; by 2005 it was making over £100 million annually.<ref name="Daily Telegraph Callender">{{cite news|last1=Callender|first1=Cat|title=Jane Shepherdson: from Topshop to Oxfam|url=http://fashion.telegraph.co.uk/article/TMG3364886/Jane-Shepherdson-from-Topshop-to-Oxfam.html|accessdate=3 November 2014|publisher=Daily Telegraph|date=11 May 2008|location=London|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141103183819/http://fashion.telegraph.co.uk/article/TMG3364886/Jane-Shepherdson-from-Topshop-to-Oxfam.html|archivedate=3 November 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

[[File:Jourdan Dunn Catwalk.jpg|thumb|right|120px|[[Jourdan Dunn]] at the 2009 [[London Fashion Week]] Topshop show.]]
Under her tenure, Topshop became a key sponsor of [[London Fashion Week]], sponsoring its Newgen arm that supports emerging British designers from 2002 and the Fashion East initiative – which acts as a bridge between London's fashion colleges and the Newgen scheme – a year later. This sponsorship continues and since 2005 it has been part of the London Fashion Week catwalk schedule.<ref name="The Independent Gonsalves">{{cite news|last1=Gonsalves|first1=Rebecca|title=How Topshop's runway shows became a must-see success|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/fashion/news/how-topshops-runway-shows-became-a-mustsee-success-9131145.html|accessdate=3 November 2014|publisher=The Independent|date=16 February 2014|location=London}}</ref>

As of 2012, it is part-owned by a US-based [[Private equity firm|private equity group]].

In 2015, Topshop started collaborating with the online retailer [[Zalando]] and began selling their merchandise in their shops. Advertisements featuring model [[Cara Delevingne]] were broadcast in Germany, Switzerland and France.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Saramowicz|first1=Caroline|title=Another Day, Another Cara Delevingne Campaign!

===Designer collections===
Topshop has been among the UK chain shops to work with high-fashion brands on capsule collections. In 1994, it launched a collection with [[Red or Dead]].<ref name="The Times 64919">{{cite news|last1=Collins|first1=Rachel|title=Hotline|issue=64919|work=The Times|date=4 April 1994}}</ref> It continued to work with designer talent, such as former [[Clements Ribeiro]] assistant [[Markus Lupfer]] – described in 1999 as "so hot he's practically steaming" – also working with, among others, [[Hussein Chalayan]], Tristan Webber and Tracey Boyd. Typically, such ranges sold out quickly, and attracted column inches in the fashion press.<ref name="The Times  66678">{{cite news|title=Fashion Diary|issue=66678|work=The Times|date=22 November 1999}}</ref><ref name="The Times 08052000">{{cite news|title=Times 2: Fashion and Style|work=The Times|date=8 May 2000}}</ref><ref name="The Times Get the Look for Less 08052000">{{cite news|title=Get the look for less|work=The Times|date=8 May 2000}}</ref><ref name="The Times 06092000">{{cite news|title=Affordable Chic|work=The Times|date=6 September 2000}}</ref>

In May 2007, British supermodel [[Kate Moss]], designed her first collection for the brand.<ref>[http://www.rogueconnect.com/lifestyle/blog.php?entry=141&title=Kate-Moss-Confirmed-For-TopShop "Kate Moss Confirmed for Topshop"] Rogue ''Connect'', 20 September 2006</ref> The appointment of Moss was announced just before the departure of Shepherdson for [[Whistles]].<ref name="The Observer Vernon"/> In the same year, artist [[Stella Vine]] designed a limited edition range inspired by her artworks.

In 2014, [[Beyoncé]] signed a deal to launch an activewear brand with Topshop.

==Protests and controversy==
Topshop has been criticised for its overseas sourcing policies and its tax arrangements.<ref name="The Observer Townsend">{{cite news|last1=Townsend|first1=Mark|title=High street stores hit in day of action over corporate tax avoidance|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/dec/19/uk-uncut-tax-avoidance-protests|accessdate=4 November 2014|publisher=The Observer|date=19 September 2010}}</ref> In December 2007, the Edinburgh branch was targeted by student campaigning network [[People & Planet]] for allegedly using cotton picked by "slave labour".<ref>{{cite news |url= http://edinburghnews.scotsman.com/education.cfm?id=1905262007 |archive-url= https://archive.is/20120715163442/http://edinburghnews.scotsman.com/education.cfm?id=1905262007 |url-status= dead |archive-date= 15 July 2012 |title= Students protest over Topshop 'slave labour' |date= 6 December 2007 |work= Edinburgh Evening News |publisher= Johnston Publishing }}</ref>

In December 2010, some 200 campaigners staged a sit-in that closed Topshop's Oxford Circus shop, and in Brighton a number of protestors glued themselves to the branch windows. Other high streets in towns and cities across Britain saw similar protests in a day of action by [[UK Uncut]] against corporate tax arrangements.<ref name=telegraphtaxprotest>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationnews/8181487/Sir-Philip-Greens-flagship-Topshop-forced-to-close-in-tax-avoidance-protest.html|title=Sir Philip Green's flagship Topshop forced to close in tax avoidance protest|accessdate=5 December 2010|publisher=The Telegraph|date=4 December 2010|location=London|first=Michael|last=Howie}}</ref> Two months later, police arrested a man for writing "pay your taxes" in washable ink on the wall of a Topshop branch in [[Colchester]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.gazette-news.co.uk/news/8868041.Arrested_by_armed_police_____for_writing_on_a_wall/|title=Arrested by armed police – for writing on a wall|publisher=Daily Gazette|date=22 February 2011|author=Frances Leate}}</ref>

In July 2013, the singer and pop star [[Rihanna]] won a lawsuit against Topshop to prevent it using her image unofficially on a T-shirt. The lawsuit was launched on the premise that Topshop customers would assume Rihanna endorsed the company, that would lead to a false representation of her celebrity image and increased tensions with her then endorsement deal with [[River Island]], a high-street rival.<ref>Aston, John. (22 January 2015). "Rihanna vs Topshop: Court dismisses high street store's appeal over use of her image". ''The Independent''.

Topshop launched an appeal to the High Court, accusing Rihanna of wrongfully advocating that: "only a celebrity may ever market his or her own character"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-30932158|title=Pop star Rihanna wins image battle|date=22 January 2015|publisher=|accessdate=9 August 2017|via=www.bbc.com}}</ref> and Judge Justice Birss of misreading the law on "celebrity merchandising".<ref>(22 January 2015). "Popstar Rihanna wins image battle". ''The BBC''.

In July 2015, Topshop has been criticised for its mannequins which some judged as too skinny. After a customer complained on Facebook, the fashion chain stopped using its tall and skinny female shop mannequins.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://fashionunited.uk/news/fashion/topshop-pulls-tall-and-skinny-mannequins/2015072917170|first=Danielle|last= Wightman-Stone|date=29 July 2015|accessdate=30 July 2015|work=[[FashionUnited]]|title=Topshop pulls tall and skinny mannequins}}</ref> Its also been criticised in October 2018 for removing an in-store pop-up in its London flagship store that was used to promote feminism with publisher Penguin after only being up for 20 minutes. The fashion retailer had agreed to host the pop-up with Penguin, to help launch the book Feminists Don't Wear Pink (And Other Lies), written by Scarlett Curtis, with products for sale supporting the UN charity Girl Up. <ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-45765336|title=Topshop dismantles feminism pop-up|date=2018-10-05|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-10-11|language=en-GB}}</ref>

In May 2016, the [[United Voices of the World|UVW union]] organised a large protest outside Topshop's Oxford Circus store attended by Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell MP. It was the headlining event in a national "day of action" involving 16 other Topshop stores around the country, supported by various trade unions and activist groups, calling for the Living Wage and dignified treatment of outsourced cleaners being victimised for trade union activity.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/john-mcdonnell-topshop-living-wage-protesters-class-war-demonstration-sir-philip-green-a7030066.html|title=John McDonnell joined living wage protest against Sir Philip Green outside Topshop|date=2016-05-15|website=The Independent|language=en|access-date=2019-03-07}}</ref> Two weeks earlier, an Early Day Motion in the House of Commons supported by 11 MPs noted:<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://edm.parliament.uk/early-day-motion/49221|title=TOPSHOP CLEANERS AND THE LIVING WAGE – Early Day Motions|website=edm.parliament.uk|access-date=2019-03-07}}</ref><blockquote>''that contract cleaners employed at Topshop stores by the contractor Britannia Services Group are paid below the living wage, forcing hard-working staff into debt and poverty; believes that there is no excuse for profitable multi-national companies which provide huge payouts to shareholders refusing to pay decent wages; fully supports cleaners contracted to work at Topshop stores who are unionising, protesting and campaigning for the living wage; is extremely concerned by reports that these staff are being victimised and bullied for asking for a decent wage; further believes that it is utterly disgraceful for the Arcadia Group, which owns Topshop, or its contractors to punish staff for asking for decent wages''</blockquote>
