==History==
Queen's Gate School was founded in 1891 by Miss Eleanor Beatrice Wyatt (who later founded [[Heathfield School, Ascot]]) in her parents' home in nearby Stanhope Gardens. The following year, the School moved to 132 Queen's Gate, later expanding into the adjacent houses at 131 and 133. In May 2005, the school acquired 125/126 Queen's Gate and refurbished it as accommodation for Junior School pupils.<ref>[http://www.queensgate.org.uk/historyandaims Mission Statement, History & Aims] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120127065240/http://www.queensgate.org.uk/historyandaims |date=27 January 2012 }}</ref>

It celebrated its 120th anniversary in 2011, and a special service was held at the local parish church, [[St Augustine's, Queen's Gate]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Producing Great Girls, Queen's Gate School|url=http://www.aspiremagazinegroup.co.uk/download/233.pdf|publisher=Aspire Magazine|page=2|date=2011|issue=233}}</ref>
