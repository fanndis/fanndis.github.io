==History==
[[File:Asheville Citizen building.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Exterior of the headquarters, 2012]]
Founded in 1870 as a weekly, the ''Citizen'' became a daily newspaper in 1885. Writers [[Thomas Wolfe]], [[O. Henry]], both buried in Asheville, and [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]], a common visitor of Asheville, frequently could be found in the newsroom in earlier days. In 1930 the ''Citizen'' came under common ownership with the ''Times'', which was first established in 1896 as the ''Asheville Gazette''. The latter paper merged with a short-lived rival, the ''Asheville Evening News'', to form the ''Asheville Gazette-News'' and was renamed ''The Asheville Times'' by new owner Charles A. Webb.<ref name=Fundinguniverse/>

The ''Citizen'' was in a former [[YMCA]] and the press was in the swimming pool. The ''Times'' was in the [[Jackson Building (Asheville, North Carolina)|Jackson Building]]. The ''Citizen'' had to leave shortly after [[Christmas]] 1938 and publisher D. Hiden Ramsey asked Tony Lord to design a new building, which went up in 15 months at 14 [[O. Henry]] Avenue and also housed the ''Times''. Charles Webb became president of both papers and the local radio station located on top of the building.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.citizen-times.com/story/news/local/2017/10/29/visiting-our-past-assessing-asheville-architecture/804649001/|title=Visiting Our Past: Assessing Asheville Architecture|last=Neufeld|first=Rob|work=Asheville Citizen-Times|date=October 29, 2017|accessdate=October 30, 2017}}</ref>

In 1954, the ''Citizen-Times'' was purchased by the [[Greenville News|Greenville News-Piedmont Company]]. In 1968 Greenville News-Piedmont merged with Southern Broadcasting Corporation to form [[Multimedia (media company)|Multimedia]].<ref name=Fundinguniverse>[http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/multimedia-inc-history/ Multimedia, Inc. History]</ref>

In 1986, $12 million was invested in offset [[printing press]]es and a new {{convert|44000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} production building in nearby [[Enka, North Carolina|Enka]], with composed pages transmitted electronically from the downtown Asheville building located nine miles (14&nbsp;km) away. In 1995, Multimedia was acquired by [[Gannett Company|Gannett]].<ref>[http://www.gannett.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/99999999/PRESSRELEASES17/100721008/-1/rss99 Gannett, Multimedia announce merger agreement] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131228162737/http://www.gannett.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F99999999%2FPRESSRELEASES17%2F100721008%2F-1%2Frss99 |date=December 28, 2013 }}</ref> In April 1997, the ''Citizen-Times'' became the first daily newspaper in Western North Carolina to launch a [[website]]; the site now receives tens of thousands of hits a day.

In Jan 2009, the press was shut down and shortly after sold off as scrap metal. Now the ''Citizen-Times'' is printed in [[Greenville, South Carolina]], alongside ''[[The Greenville News]]'' and shipped to a distribution center.
