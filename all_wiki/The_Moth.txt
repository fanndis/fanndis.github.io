'''The Moth''' is a non-profit group based in [[New York City]] dedicated to the art and craft of [[storytelling]].<ref name="About The Moth">{{cite web |url=http://themoth.org/about |title=About: The Moth |website=TheMoth.org |publisher=The Moth |accessdate=January 18, 2014}}</ref> Founded in 1997, the organization presents a wide range of theme-based storytelling events across the United States and abroad, often featuring prominent literary and cultural personalities.<ref name="About The Moth"/> The Moth offers a weekly [[podcast]] and in 2009 launched a national public radio show, ''The Moth Radio Hour'', which won a 2010 [[Peabody Award]].<ref name="Moth Radio">{{cite web |url=http://themoth.org/radio |title=About: ''The Moth Radio Hour'' |website=TheMoth.org |accessdate=January 15, 2014}}</ref><ref name="Peabody">{{cite web|url=http://www.peabodyawards.com/award-profile/the-moth-radio-hour |title=Peabody Awards: Winner 2010 - ''The Moth'', Public Radio Exchange, Atlantic Public Media |website=PeabodyAwards.com |accessdate=September 19, 2014}}</ref> The Moth has published three books: ''The Moth: 50 True Stories'' (2013) reached #22 on ''[[The New York Times]]'' Paperback Nonfiction [[The New York Times Best Seller list|Best-Seller List]];<ref name="NYT 2013-12">{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/best-sellers-books/2014-01-05/paperback-nonfiction/list.html|title=BEST SELLERS (Paperback Nonfiction): December 29, 2013|date=December 29, 2013|website=NYTimes.com|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=January 15, 2014}}</ref> ''All These Wonders: True Stories about Facing the Unknown'' (2017); and ''Occasional Magic: True Stories About Defying the Impossible'' (2019).

==Origins==
The Moth was founded in 1997 by poet and novelist [[George Dawes Green]], who wanted to recreate the feeling of sultry summer evenings in his native [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], when [[moth]]s were attracted to the light on the [[porch]] where he and his friends would gather to spin spellbinding tales.<ref name="About The Moth"/><ref>{{cite AV media|title=The Moth: The Story Behind the Storytellers (PODIUM: The Art of Oration)|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBEm2r0VXc4 |publisher=[[@radical.media]]/THNKR|date=May 2013|accessdate=January 10, 2014}}</ref> Green and his original group of storytellers called themselves "The Moths", and Green took the name with him to [[New York City|New York]].<ref name="About The Moth"/> The non-profit organization now runs over 500 different storytelling programs a year in more than 25 US cities (including New York City, [[Los Angeles]], [[Chicago]], and [[Detroit]]) and four cities outside the US ([[London]], [[Dublin]], [[Sydney]], and [[Melbourne]]) offering the unique perspectives of both average, everyday people, and literary or cultural personalities.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://themoth.org/events|title=The Moth {{!}} Live Storytelling Events|website=The Moth|access-date=2016-12-08}}</ref>

==Live events==
The Moth's live shows fall into several tiers of production, but each is dedicated to the art of unscripted, first-person storytelling.<ref name="About The Moth"/><ref name="Moth Programs">{{cite web |url=http://themoth.org/about/programs |title=About: The Moth Programs |website=TheMoth.org |publisher=The Moth |accessdate=January 18, 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307015956/http://themoth.org/about/programs |archivedate=March 7, 2016 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Every show has stories based on open-ended themes (Such as "Hot Mess," or "Conviction").

=== Mainstage ===
The Moth Mainstage is their curated flagship program, which is a "staple" of the literary scenes in New York City and Los Angeles and regularly tours around the United States and the world as The Moth on the Road.<ref name="Moth Programs" /><ref>{{cite web|title=Don't Look Back: The Moth in Portland|url=http://www.portland5.com/arlene-schnitzer-concert-hall/events/dont-look-back-moth-portland|website=Portland5.com|publisher=Portland's 5 Centers for the Arts|accessdate=January 17, 2014}}</ref><ref name="Moth Mainstage">{{cite web|title=About: The Moth Mainstage|url=http://themoth.org/about/programs/the-moth-mainstage|website=TheMoth.org|publisher=The Moth|accessdate=January 17, 2014}}</ref> Storytellers at the Mainstages include renowned personalities, past StorySLAM or GrandSLAM winners, and average people who may have submitted their stories through The Moth Pitchline.

=== StorySLAMS and GrandSLAMS ===
The organization also hosts The Moth [[StorySLAM]] events, which are [[open mic]] storytelling competitions open to everyone in cities across the United States, including but not limited to [[New York City]], [[Detroit]], [[Chicago]], Houston, [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]], [[Ann Arbor, Michigan|Ann Arbor]], [[Pittsburgh]], [[Miami]], [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]], and [[Los Angeles]].<ref name="Moth Programs" /><ref>{{cite AV media|title=The Moth: The Best Storytellers in the World (PODIUM: The Art of Oration)|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23frsMMKud8&list=PLTP7oKl8qFmmeTJKIDMStongHGSKfKcNJ|publisher=@radical.media/THNKR|date=April 2013|accessdate=January 19, 2014}}</ref> The format was inspired by and is similar to [[poetry slam]]s.

For the StorySLAM, ten participants are chosen at random from a pool of volunteer storytellers to tell a true story or tall tale (without notes) in the five to six-minute range. Storytellers are scored based on the content of their stories, and their storytelling abilities, by three teams of judges—selected from audience members—on a scale from one to ten. The storyteller with the highest score wins the StorySLAM.

After 10 StorySLAMS have occurred in a city, the 10 winners then advance to The Moth GrandSLAM, which draws crowds of hundreds (or thousands) and as a result is held in a larger venue than the monthly StorySLAMs. The same rules apply to the GrandSLAM as in the StorySLAM.

== Programs ==
In addition to live performances, The Moth conducts a variety of community, education, and corporate workshops that teach the art and craft of storytelling in various regions and communities.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://themoth.org/education|title=Education Program|publisher=The Moth|access-date=December 8, 2016}}</ref><ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=https://themoth.org/community|title=Community Program|publisher=The Moth|access-date=December 8, 2016}}</ref><ref name=":2">{{Cite web|url=https://themoth.org/share-your-story/corporate-program|title=Corporate Training|publisher=The Moth|access-date=December 8, 2016}}</ref>

=== Community ===
Since 1999, the Moth's Community Program strives to encourage the art of storytelling in communities typically under-represented by the mainstream media. They teach and inspire budding raconteurs to effectively tell their stories to those who are both willing and unwilling to listen, and they often feature workshop members on The Moth website and podcast.<ref name=":1" />

=== Education ===
The Education Program works with students, teachers, and professors from high-school through college to promote stronger community bonds within the student body and the administration. The overall mission is to prepare students for the world ahead of them by teaching crucial aspects of language and rhetoric, and to allow students and teachers to experience one another in a more intimate setting. In 2012 The Moth launched the High School Slam program, which brings StorySLAMs to public high schools in New York City. They currently hold SLAMs at twelve high schools in three boroughs, and an All-City SLAM that allows for inter-connectivity between students in all the boroughs.<ref name=":0" />

=== MothWorks ===
MothWorks uses the essential elements of Moth storytelling at work and other unexpected places. Private workshops teach employees to utilize the power of storytelling to promote their business goals and ideas, while custom events to highlight the voices and mission of an organization in a unique setting.<ref name=":2" />

==Broadcasting==
In August 2009, the organization launched a national public radio show, ''The Moth Radio Hour'', produced by [[Jay Allison]] and distributed by [[Public Radio Exchange]].<ref name="Moth Radio"/><ref name="Moth Programs"/> In the fall of 2009 ''The Moth Radio Hour'' was licensed by more than 200 public radio stations, and it later won a 2010 [[Peabody Award]].<ref name="Moth Radio"/><ref name="Peabody"/><ref name="Moth Programs"/> Now, 500 public radio stations host ''The Moth Radio Hour,''<ref name="Moth Radio"/> which has over 1,000,000 weekly listeners.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

The Moth offers a weekly [[podcast]], which provides free audio of curated stories from live Moth events. The podcast has over 500,000 weekly downloads; in 2018, the podcast was downloaded over 61 million times.<ref name="Moth Programs" />

==Controversies==

Media critic Jack Shafer criticized best selling author Malcolm Gladwell for telling a fictionalized story about his work at the Washington Post that was picked up by the Moth public radio show.  Gladwell responded by pointing out that the Moth includes both true stories and the occasional tall tale. He said his piece clearly fell into the latter category. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2008/03/separating-bunk-from-fact-in-malcolm-gladwell-s-performance-at-a-new-york-storytelling-forum.html}}</ref>
