'''Bergen''' ({{IPA-no|ˈbæ̀ɾɡn̩|-|Bergen.ogg}}), historically '''Bjørgvin''', is a city and [[municipalities of Norway|municipality]] in [[Vestland]] county on the [[Western Norway|west coast]] of [[Norway]]. {{As of|2019|12|alt=At the end of 2019}}, the municipality's population was 283,929.<ref name=Pop2019Q4>{{cite web|url=https://www.ssb.no/en/befolkning/statistikker/folkemengde|title=Table 2: Population and quarterly population changes. The whole country, counties and municipalities|date=27 February 2020|publisher=Statistics Norway|accessdate=2 March 2020}}</ref> Bergen is the [[list of towns and cities in Norway|second-largest]] city in Norway. The municipality covers {{convert|465|km2}} and is on the peninsula of [[Bergenshalvøyen]]. The city centre and northern neighbourhoods are on [[Byfjorden (Hordaland)|Byfjorden]], 'the city fjord', and the city is surrounded by mountains; Bergen is known as the "city of [[Seven Mountains, Bergen|seven mountains]]". Many of the extra-municipal suburbs are on islands. Bergen is the [[administrative centre]] of Vestland county.  The city consists of eight boroughs: [[Arna, Norway|Arna]], [[Bergenhus]], [[Fana]], [[Fyllingsdalen]], [[Laksevåg]], [[Ytrebygda]], [[Årstad, Bergen|Årstad]], and [[Åsane]].

Trading in Bergen may have started as early as the 1020s. According to tradition, the city was founded in 1070 by king [[Olaf III of Norway|Olav Kyrre]] and was named Bjørgvin, 'the green meadow among the mountains'. It served as Norway's capital in the 13th century, and from the end of the 13th century became a [[Kontor|bureau city]] of the [[Hanseatic League]]. Until 1789, Bergen enjoyed exclusive rights to mediate trade between [[Northern Norway]] and abroad and it was the largest city in Norway until the 1830s when it was overtaken by the capital, Christiania (now known as [[Oslo]]). What remains of the quays, [[Bryggen]], is a [[World Heritage Site]]. The city was hit by numerous fires over the years. The [[Bergen School of Meteorology]] was developed at the [[Geophysical Institute, University of Bergen|Geophysical Institute]] starting in 1917, the [[Norwegian School of Economics]] was founded in 1936, and the [[University of Bergen]] in 1946. From 1831 to 1972, Bergen was its own [[counties of Norway|county]]. In 1972 the municipality absorbed four surrounding municipalities and became a part of Hordaland county.

The city is an international center for [[aquaculture]], [[ship transport|shipping]], the offshore [[petroleum industry]] and [[subsea]] technology, and a national centre for higher education, media, tourism and finance. [[Bergen Port]] is Norway's busiest in terms of both freight and passengers, with over 300 cruise ship calls a year bringing nearly a half a million passengers to Bergen,<ref>{{cite web|last1=Heggemsnes|first1=Nils|title=Bergen Havn|url=https://snl.no/Bergen_havn|website=Store norske leksikon|accessdate=8 January 2016|language=Norwegian|date=26 September 2012}}</ref> a number that has doubled in 10 years.<ref name="Port of Bergen">{{cite web|title=Cruisestatistikk|url=http://bergenhavn.no/cruise/cruisestatistikk/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150526145406/http://bergenhavn.no/cruise/cruisestatistikk/|url-status=dead|archive-date=2015-05-26|website=Cruise|publisher=Port of Bergen|accessdate=8 January 2016|language=Norwegian|date=2016}}</ref> Almost half of the passengers are German or British.<ref name="Port of Bergen" /> The city's main football team is [[SK Brann]] and a unique tradition of the city is the [[buekorps]]. Natives speak a distinct dialect, known as [[Bergensk]]. The city features [[Bergen Airport, Flesland]] and [[Bergen Light Rail]], and is the terminus of the [[Bergen Line]]. Four large bridges connect Bergen to its suburban municipalities.

Bergen has a mild winter climate, though with a lot of precipitation. From December to March, Bergen can be, in rare cases, up to 20&nbsp;°C warmer than Oslo, even though both cities are at about 60° North. The [[Gulf Stream]] keeps the sea relatively warm, considering the latitude, and the mountains protect the city from cold winds from the north, north-east and east.

[[File:Scoleus.jpg|thumb|left|Hieronymus Scholeus's impression of Bergen.

The city of Bergen was traditionally thought to have been founded by king [[Olaf III of Norway|Olav Kyrre]], son of [[Harald III of Norway|Harald Hardråde]] in 1070{nbs}}AD,<ref name="omkomm">{{cite web|url=http://www.bergen.kommune.no/aktuelt/omkommunen |title=Om kommunen |accessdate=16 September 2007 |publisher=Bergen kommune |year=2007 |author=Elisabeth Farstad |language=Norwegian |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071005165817/http://www.bergen.kommune.no/aktuelt/omkommunen |archivedate=5 October 2007}}</ref> four years after the Viking Age in England ended with the [[Battle of Stamford Bridge]]. Modern research has, however, discovered that a trading settlement had already been established in the 1020s or 1030s.<ref>NRK, "[http://www.nrk.no/nyheter/distrikt/hordaland/1.201637 Bergens historie må skrives om]"</ref>

Bergen gradually assumed the function of capital of Norway in the early 13th century, as the first city where a rudimentary central administration was established. The city's cathedral was the site of the first royal coronation in Norway in the 1150s, and continued to host royal coronations throughout the 13th century. [[Bergenhus fortress]] dates from the 1240s and guards the entrance to the harbour in Bergen. The functions of the capital city were lost to [[Oslo]] during the reign of King [[Haakon V of Norway|Haakon V]] (1299–1319).

In the middle of the 14th century, North German merchants, who had already been present in substantial numbers since the 13th century, founded one of the four ''{{lang|de|[[Kontor]]e}}'' of the [[Hanseatic League]] at [[Bryggen]] in Bergen. The principal export traded from Bergen was dried cod from the northern Norwegian coast,<ref name="codmr">{{cite web |url=http://bell.lib.umn.edu/Products/cod.html |title=Cod |accessdate=14 August 2007 |year=2007 |author=Marguerite Ragnow }}</ref> which started around 1100. The city was granted a monopoly for trade from the north of Norway by King [[Håkon Håkonsson]] (1217–1263).<ref name="Stockfish">{{cite news|title=- Tørrfisken vender hjem|newspaper=Bergensavisen|date=2013-12-16|author=Tom R.

In 1665, the city's harbour was the site of the [[Battle of Vågen]], when an English naval flotilla attacked a Dutch merchant and treasure fleet supported by the city's garrison. Accidental fires sometimes got out of control, and one in 1702 reduced most of the town to ashes.

Throughout the 15th and 16th centuries, Bergen remained one of the largest cities in [[Scandinavia]], and it was Norway's biggest city until the 1830s,<ref name="attentretti">{{cite web |url=http://www.arkivverket.no/webfelles/sab/innvandring/index.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021206093817/http://www.arkivverket.no/webfelles/sab/innvandring/index.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=6 December 2002 |title=Innvandring 1600–2000, Arkivenes dag 2002 |accessdate=9 October 2007 |publisher=Arkivverket |language=Norwegian }}</ref> when the capital city of [[Oslo]] became the largest. From around 1600, the Hanseatic dominance of the city's trade gradually declined in favour of Norwegian merchants (often of Hanseatic ancestry), and in the 1750s, the Hanseatic ''{{lang|de|Kontor}}''{{clarify|date=January 2019}} finally closed. Bergen retained its monopoly of trade with northern Norway until 1789.<ref name="histnor">{{cite web|url=http://www.regjeringen.no/nb/dep/ud/dok/NOU-er/2003/NOU-2003-32/10.html?id=373172 |title=Historien om Norge i nord |accessdate=9 October 2007 |publisher=Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs |year=2003 |author=Ivan Kristoffersen |language=Norwegian |authorlink=Ivan Kristoffersen |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080328031006/http://www.regjeringen.no/nb/dep/ud/dok/NOU-er/2003/NOU-2003-32/10.html?id=373172 |archivedate=28 March 2008}}</ref> The Bergen stock exchange, the ''{{lang|no|Bergen børs}}'', was established in 1813.

During World War II, Bergen was occupied on the first day of the German invasion on 9 April 1940, after a brief fight between German ships and the Norwegian [[coastal artillery]]. The [[Norwegian resistance movement]] groups in Bergen were [[Osvald Group|Saborg]], [[Milorg]], ''"{{lang|no|[[Theta (SIS radio group)|Theta-gruppen]]}}"'', [[Sivorg]], ''{{lang|no|[[Stein-organisasjonen]]}}'' and the Communist Party.<ref name="Prosjektbeskrivelse">{{cite news|title=Prosjektbeskrivelse for det historiske forskningsprosjektet SABORG I BERGEN|url=http://www.fagforbundet.no/file.php?id=11179|author=Jenny Heggsvik|author2=Lars Borgersrud|author3=August Rathke|author4=Egil Christophersen|author5=Ole-Jacob Abraham|access-date=30 November 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170313131238/http://www.fagforbundet.no/file.php?id=11179|archive-date=13 March 2017|url-status=dead|author2-link = Lars Borgersrud}}</ref> On 20 April 1944, during the German occupation, the Dutch cargo ship ''{{lang|nl|[[Voorbode]]}}'' anchored off the [[Bergenhus Fortress]], loaded with over 120 tons of explosives, and blew up, killing at least 150 people and damaging historic buildings. The city was subject to some Allied [[strategic bombing|bombing raids]], aimed at German naval installations in the harbour. Some of these caused Norwegian civilian casualties numbering about 100.

The rural municipalities of [[Arna, Norway|Arna]], [[Fana]], [[Laksevåg]], and [[Åsane]] were merged with Bergen on 1 January 1972.

===Fires===
The city's history is marked by numerous great fires. In 1198, the {{lang|no|[[Bagler]]}} faction set fire to the city in connection with a battle against the {{lang|no|[[Birkebeiner]]}} faction during the civil war. In 1248, {{lang|no|Holmen}} and {{lang|no|Sverresborg}} burned, and 11 churches were destroyed. In 1413 another fire struck the city, and 14 churches were destroyed. In 1428 the city was plundered by the [[Victual Brothers]], and in 1455, [[Hanseatic League|Hanseatic]] merchants were responsible for burning down [[Munkeliv Abbey]]. In 1476, {{lang|no|Bryggen}} burned down in a fire started by a drunk trader. In 1582, another fire hit the city centre and {{lang|no|Strandsiden}}. In 1675, 105 buildings burned down in {{lang|no|Øvregaten}}. In 1686 another great fire hit {{lang|no|Strandsiden}}, destroying 231 city blocks and 218 boathouses. The greatest fire in history was in 1702, when 90% of the city was burned to ashes. In 1751, there was a great fire at {{lang|no|Vågsbunnen}}. In 1756, yet another fire at {{lang|no|Strandsiden}} burned down 1,500 buildings, and further great fires hit {{lang|no|Strandsiden}} in 1771 and 1901. In 1916, 300 buildings burned down in the city centre, and in 1955 parts of {{lang|no|Bryggen}} burned down.

===Toponymy===
Bergen is pronounced in English {{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|ɜːr|g|ən}} or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|ɛər|g|ən}} and in [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] {{IPA-no|ˈbæ̀rɡn̩||Bergen.ogg}}. The [[Old Norse]] forms of the name were ''{{lang|non|Bergvin}}'' and ''{{lang|non|Bjǫrgvin}}'' (and in [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] and [[Faroese language|Faroese]] the city is still called ''{{lang|is|Björgvin}}''). The first element is {{wikt-lang|non|berg}} (n.) or ''{{lang|non|bjǫrg}}'' (n.), which translates as 'mountain(s)'. The last element is {{wikt-lang|non|vin}} (f.), which means a new settlement where there used to be a pasture or meadow. The full meaning is then "the meadow among the mountains".<ref>{{cite book |last=Brekke |first=Nils Georg |title=Kulturhistorisk vegbok Hordaland |publisher=Hordaland Fylkeskommune |year=1993 |location=Bergen |language=Norwegian |page=252 |isbn=82-7326-026-7 }}</ref> This is a suitable name: Bergen is often called "the city among the seven mountains". It was the playwright [[Ludvig Holberg]] who felt so inspired by the [[seven hills of Rome]], that he decided that his home town must be blessed with a corresponding seven mountains – and locals still argue which seven they are.

In 1918, there was a campaign to reintroduce the Norse form ''{{lang|non|Bjørgvin}}'' as the name of the city. This was turned down – but as a compromise, the name of the [[diocese]] was changed to ''{{lang|no|[[Diocese of Bjørgvin|Bjørgvin bispedømme]]}}''.<ref name="bispedoeme">{{cite web|url=http://www.scandion.no/article/archive/826/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071226020759/http://www.scandion.no/article/archive/826/ |archivedate=26 December 2007 |title=Bjørgvin bispedøme |accessdate=10 October 2007 |publisher=Scandion.no |year=2004 |language=Norwegian |url-status=dead}}</ref>

Bergen occupies most of the peninsula of [[Bergenshalvøyen]] in the [[districts of Norway|district]] of [[Midthordland]] in mid-western Hordaland. The municipality covers an area of {{convert|465|km2|0|abbr=off}}. Most of the urban area is on or close to a fjord or bay, although the urban area has several mountains. The city centre is surrounded by the [[Seven Mountains, Bergen|Seven Mountains]], although there is disagreement as to which of the nine mountains constitute these. [[Ulriken]], [[Fløyen]], [[Løvstakken]] and [[Damsgårdsfjellet]] are always included as well as three of [[Lyderhorn]], [[Sandviksfjellet]], [[Blåmanen]], [[Rundemanen]] and [[Kolbeinsvarden]].<ref name="syvendehm">{{cite web |url=http://www.bt.no/kuriosa/article380762.ece |title=I den syvende himmel |accessdate=14 August 2007 |work=Bergens Tidende |year=2007 |author=Gunhild Agdesteen |language=Norwegian |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930041155/http://www.bt.no/kuriosa/article380762.ece |archivedate=30 September 2007}}</ref> [[Gullfjellet]] is Bergen's highest mountain, at {{convert|987|m}} [[above mean sea level]].<ref name="wcpeaks">{{cite web |url=http://www.westcoastpeaks.com/Peaks/gullfjellstoppen.html |title=Norwegian Mountains: Gullfjellstoppen |accessdate=8 September 2007}}</ref>

Bergen is sheltered from the North Sea by the islands [[Askøy]], [[Holsnøy]] (the municipality of [[Meland]]) and [[Sotra]] (the municipalities of [[Fjell]] and [[Sund, Norway|Sund]]). Bergen borders the municipalities [[Meland]], [[Lindås]], and [[Osterøy]] to the north, [[Vaksdal]] and [[Samnanger]] to the east, [[Os, Hordaland|Os]] and [[Austevoll]] to the south, and [[Sund, Norway|Sund]], [[Fjell]], and [[Askøy]] to the west.

==Climate==
[[File:Bergen vågsallmenningen rain.jpg|thumb|left|Bergen on a rainy day]]
Bergen has an [[oceanic climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Cfb''), with plentiful rainfall in all seasons; with intermittent snowfall during winter, but the snow usually melts quickly in the city. Average annual [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] during 1961–90 was {{convert|2250|mm|in|abbr=on}}.<ref name="nedboerstat">{{cite web

Bergen's weather is much warmer than the city's latitude (60.4° N) might suggest. Temperatures below −10&nbsp;°C (14&nbsp;°F) are rare. Summer temperatures sometimes reach the upper 20s, temperatures over 30{{nbs}}°C were previously only seen a few days each decade. The growing season in Bergen is exceptionally long for its latitude, with more than 200 days. Its mild winters and proximity to the Gulf stream move the plant hardiness zone between 8b and 9a depending on location. 

The high precipitation is often used in the marketing of the city, and features to a degree on postcards sold in the city. Compared to areas behind the mountains on the Scandinavian peninsula, Bergen is much wetter and has a narrower temperature range, with cool summers and mild winters. The old sunshine hours data was from the met office in the city; at this location sunlight is obscured by mountains, especially by Ulriken.<ref name="soltimer Bergen">{{Cite web | url=http://www.arstadposten.no/2017/02/10/1600-soltimer-bergen-fjor-trass-elendig-vaer-skoleferien/ |title = Over 1600 soltimer i Bergen i fjor trass i elendig vær i skoleferien|date = 2017-02-10}}</ref> A new sunrecorder was established at Bergen Airport in December 2015, and this records from 1450 to 1750 (2018) hours of sunshine.

Ethnic [[Norwegians]] make up 84.5% of Bergen's residents. In addition, 8.1% were [[Immigrant generations|first]] or second generation immigrants of Western background and 7.4% were first or second generation immigrants of non-Western background.<ref name="ssbtall"/> The population grew by 4,549 people in 2009, a growth rate of 1,8%. Ninety-six percent of the population lives in urban areas.

The immigrant population (those with two foreign-born parents) in Bergen, includes 42,169 individuals with backgrounds from more than 200 countries representing 15.5% of the city's population (2014). Of these, 50.2% have background from Europe, 28.9% from Asia, 13.1% from Africa, 5.5% from Latin America, 1.9% from North America, and 0.4% from Oceania. The immigrant population in Bergen in the period 1993–2008 increased by 119.7%, while the ethnic Norwegian population grew by 8.1% during the same period. The national average is 138.0% and 4.2%. The immigrant population has thus accounted for 43.6% of Bergen's population growth and 60.8% of Norway's population growth during the period 1993–2008, compared with 84.5% in Oslo.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://statbank.ssb.no/statistikkbanken/Default_FR.asp?PXSid=0&nvl=true&PLanguage=0&tilside=selecttable/hovedtabellHjem.asp&KortnavnWeb=innvbef |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120526191822/http://statbank.ssb.no/statistikkbanken/Default_FR.asp?PXSid=0&nvl=true&PLanguage=0&tilside=selecttable/hovedtabellHjem.asp&KortnavnWeb=innvbef |url-status=dead |archive-date=26 May 2012 |title=Statistics Norway |publisher=Stat Bank |accessdate=4 January 2012 }}</ref>

The immigrant population in Bergen has changed a lot since 1970. As of 1 January 1986, there were 2,870 people with a non-Western immigrant background in Bergen. In 2006, this figure had increased to 14,630, so the non-Western immigrant population in Bergen was five times higher than in 1986. This is a slightly slower growth than the national average, which has sextupled during the same period. Also in relation to the total population in Bergen, the proportion of non-Westerns increased significantly. In 1986, the proportion of the total population in the municipality of non-Western background was 3.6%. In January 2006, people with a non-Western immigrant background accounted for 6 percent of the population in Bergen. The share of Western immigrants has remained stable at around 2% in the period. The number of [[Poles]] in Bergen rose from 697 in 2006 to 3,128 in 2010.<ref>[http://www.bt.no/multimedia/archive/00321/Faktaark_321842a.pdf Immigrant population in Bergen]{{dead link|date=January 2012}}</ref>

The city centre of Bergen lies in the west of the municipality, facing the fjord of [[Byfjorden (Hordaland)|Byfjorden]]. It is among a group of mountains known as the [[Seven Mountains, Bergen|Seven Mountains]], although the number is a matter of definition. From here, the urban area of Bergen extends to the north, west and south, and to its east is a large mountain massif. Outside the city centre and the surrounding neighbourhoods (i.e. [[Årstad, Bergen|Årstad]], inner [[Laksevåg]] and [[Sandviken, Norway|Sandviken]]), the majority of the population lives in relatively sparsely populated residential areas built after 1950. While some are dominated by [[apartment|apartment building]]s and modern [[terraced house]]s (e.g. [[Fyllingsdalen]]), others are dominated by [[single-family detached home|single-family home]]s.<ref name="bl27">{{cite encyclopedia |last=Hagen Hartvedt|first=Gunnar|encyclopedia=[[Bergen Byleksikon]]|title=Bergen|edition=1st|year=1994|publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget|location=Oslo|isbn=82-573-0485-9|pages=27}}</ref>

The oldest part of Bergen is the area around the bay of Vågen in the city centre. Originally centred on the bay's eastern side, Bergen eventually expanded west and southwards. Few buildings from the oldest period remain, the most significant being [[St Mary's Church, Bergen|St Mary's Church]] from the 12th century. For several hundred years, the extent of the city remained almost constant. The population was stagnant, and the city limits were narrow.<ref name="bl23">{{cite encyclopedia |last=Hagen Hartvedt|first=Gunnar|encyclopedia=Bergen Byleksikon|title=Bergen|edition=1st|year=1994|publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget|location=Oslo|isbn=82-573-0485-9|pages=23}}</ref> In 1702, seven-eighths of the city burned. Most of the old buildings of Bergen, including Bryggen (which was rebuilt in a mediaeval style), were built after the fire. The fire marked a transition from [[tar]] covered houses, as well as the remaining [[log home|log house]]s, to painted and some brick-covered wooden buildings.<ref name="bl25">{{cite encyclopedia |last=Hagen Hartvedt|first=Gunnar|encyclopedia=Bergen Byleksikon|title=Bergen|edition=1st|year=1994|publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget|location=Oslo|isbn=82-573-0485-9|pages=25}}</ref>

The last half of the 19th century saw a period of rapid expansion and modernisation. The fire of 1855 west of [[Torgallmenningen]] led to the development of regularly sized city blocks in this area of the city centre. The city limits were expanded in 1876, and [[Nygård, Norway|Nygård]], [[Møhlenpris]] and [[Sandviken, Norway|Sandviken]] were urbanized with large-scale construction of city blocks housing both the poor and the wealthy.<ref name="bt_nygaardshøyden">{{cite news | first=Kjell | last=Østerbø | title=Da rike og fattige fikk sine strøk | date=23 September 2007 | url=http://www.bt.no/lokalt/bergen/article413890.ece | work=Bergens Tidende | accessdate=18 December 2008 | language=Norwegian | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080625091158/http://www.bt.no/lokalt/bergen/article413890.ece | archivedate=25 June 2008}}</ref> Their architecture is influenced by a variety of styles; [[historicism (art)|historicism]], [[classicism]] and [[Art Nouveau]].<ref name="bl2526">{{cite encyclopedia |last=Hagen Hartvedt|first=Gunnar|encyclopedia=Bergen Byleksikon|title=Bergen|edition=1st|year=1994|publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget|location=Oslo|isbn=82-573-0485-9|pages=25–26}}</ref> The wealthy built villas between Møhlenpris and Nygård, and on the side of Mount Fløyen; these areas were also added to Bergen in 1876. Simultaneously, an urbanization process was taking place in [[Solheimsviken]] in Årstad, at that time outside the Bergen municipality, centred on the large industrial activity in the area.<ref name="bl2627">{{cite encyclopedia |last=Hagen Hartvedt|first=Gunnar|encyclopedia=Bergen Byleksikon|title=Bergen|edition=1st|year=1994|publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget|location=Oslo|isbn=82-573-0485-9|pages=26–27}}</ref> The workers' homes in this area were poorly built, and little remains after large-scale redevelopment in the 1960s-1980s.

After Årstad became a part of Bergen in 1916, a development plan was applied to the new area. Few city blocks akin to those in Nygård and Møhlenpris were planned. Many of the worker class built their own homes, and many small, detached apartment buildings were built. After World War II, Bergen had again run short of land to build on, and, contrary to the original plans, many large apartment buildings were built in [[Landås]] in the 1950s and 1960s. Bergen acquired [[Fyllingsdalen]] from [[Fana (municipality)|Fana]] municipality in 1955. Like similar areas in Oslo (e.g. [[Lambertseter]]), Fyllingsdalen was developed into a modern suburb with large apartment buildings, [[Tower block|mid-rise]]s, and some single-family homes, in the 1960s and 1970s. Similar developments took place beyond Bergen's city limits, for example in [[Loddefjord]].<ref name="bl961">{{cite encyclopedia |last=Hagen Hartvedt|first=Gunnar|encyclopedia=Bergen Byleksikon|title=Bergen|edition=1st|year=1994|publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget|location=Oslo|isbn=82-573-0485-9|pages=9–61}}</ref>

At the same time as [[New town|planned city]] expansion took place inside Bergen, its extra-municipal suburbs also grew rapidly. Wealthy citizens of Bergen had been living in Fana since the 19th century, but as the city expanded it became more convenient to settle in the municipality. Similar processes took place in [[Åsane]] and Laksevåg. Most of the homes in these areas are detached [[Terraced house|row house]]s,{{clarify|reason=row houses are attached, by definition|date=April 2020}} single family homes or small apartment buildings.<ref name="bl961"/> After the surrounding municipalities were merged with Bergen in 1972, expansion has continued in largely the same manner, although the municipality encourages condensing near commercial centres, future [[Bergen Light Rail]] stations, and elsewhere.<ref name="bt_fortetting1">{{cite news | first=Pål Andreas | last=Mæland | title=Nå kommer slangen til Paradis | date=16 May 2008 | url=http://www.bt.no/lokalt/bergen/article564560.ece | archive-url=https://archive.today/20130112052521/http://www.bt.no/lokalt/bergen/article564560.ece | url-status=dead | archive-date=12 January 2013 | work=[[Bergens Tidende]] | accessdate=18 December 2008 | language=Norwegian }}</ref><ref name="bt_fortetting2">{{cite news|first=Eva |last=Røyrane |title=Bergen bygges tettere |date=9 May 2007 |url=http://bt.no/forbruker/husoghjem/article361530.ece |work=[[Bergens Tidende]] |accessdate=18 December 2008 |language=Norwegian |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807100820/http://www.bt.no/forbruker/husoghjem/article361530.ece |archivedate=7 August 2011}}</ref>

As part of the modernisation wave of the 1950s and 1960s, and due to damage caused by World War II, the [[Local government|city government]] ambitiously planned redevelopment of many areas in central Bergen. The plans involved demolition of several neighbourhoods of wooden houses, namely [[Nordnes]], Marken, and Stølen. None of the plans was carried out in its original form; the Marken and Stølen redevelopment plans were discarded and that of Nordnes only carried out in the area that had been most damaged by war. The city council of Bergen had in 1964 voted to demolish the entirety of Marken, however, the decision proved to be highly controversial and the decision was reversed in 1974. Bryggen was under threat of being wholly or partly demolished after the fire of 1955, when a large number of the buildings burned to the ground. Instead of being demolished, the remaining buildings were restored and accompanied by reconstructions of some of the burned buildings.<ref name="bl961"/>

Demolition of old buildings and occasionally whole city blocks is still taking place, the most recent major example being the 2007 razing of Jonsvollskvartalet at Nøstet.<ref name="bt_jonsvoll">{{cite news | first=Liv Solli | last=Okkenhaug | title=Rev de siste husene | date=21 April 2007 | url=http://www.bt.no/lokalt/bergen/article357421.ece | work=[[Bergens Tidende]] | accessdate=18 December 2008 | language=Norwegian | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070427074218/http://www.bt.no/lokalt/bergen/article357421.ece | archivedate=27 April 2007}}</ref>

The Labour Party formed a new centre-left city government with the Liberal Party and the Christian Democrats. The Labour Party is now holding both the mayor office and governing mayor office.

Local borough administrations have varied since Bergen's expansion in 1972. From 1974, each borough had a politically chosen administration. From 1989, Bergen was divided into 12 health and social districts, each locally administered.

[[Bergensk]] is the native dialect of Bergen and a variation of Vestnorsk. It was strongly influenced by [[Low German]]-speaking merchants from the mid-14th to mid-18th centuries. During the [[Denmark–Norway|Dano-Norwegian period]] from 1536 to 1814, Bergen was more influenced by [[Danish language|Danish]] than other areas of Norway. The Danish influence removed the female [[grammatical gender]] in the 16th century, making Bergensk one of very few Norwegian dialects with only two instead of three grammatical genders. The Rs are [[uvular trill]]s, as in French, which probably spread to Bergen some time in the 18th century, overtaking the [[alveolar trill]] in the time span of two to three generations. Owing to an improved [[literacy rate]], Bergensk was influenced by [[Norwegian Bokmål|riksmål]] and bokmål in the 19th and 20th centuries. This led to large parts of the German-inspired [[vocabulary]] disappearing and pronunciations shifting slightly towards East Norwegian.<ref name="slikblevi">{{cite book | title=Slik ble vi bergensere – Hanseatene og bergensdialekten| last=Nesse| first=Agnete|year=2003| publisher=Sigma Forlag| isbn=82-7916-028-0}}</ref>
