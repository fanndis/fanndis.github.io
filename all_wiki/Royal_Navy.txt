{{Royal Navy}}

The '''Royal Navy''' ('''RN''') is the [[United Kingdom]]'s [[Navy|naval warfare force]]. Although warships were used by English and Scottish kings from the early medieval period, the first major maritime engagements were fought in the [[Hundred Years' War]] against the [[Kingdom of France]]. The modern Royal Navy traces its origins to the early 16th century; the oldest of the UK's armed services, it is known as the '''Senior Service'''.

From the middle decades of the 17th century, and through the 18th century, the Royal Navy vied with the [[Dutch Navy]] and later with the [[French Navy]] for maritime supremacy. From the mid 18th century, it was the world's most powerful navy until the [[Second World War]]. The Royal Navy played a key part in establishing the [[British Empire]] as the [[superpower|unmatched world power]] during the 19th and first part of the 20th centuries. Due to this historical prominence, it is common, even among non-Britons, to refer to it as "the Royal Navy" without qualification.

Following [[World War I]], the Royal Navy was significantly reduced in size,<ref>Rose, ''Power at Sea'', p. 36</ref> although at the onset of [[World War II]] it was still the world's largest. During the [[Cold War]], the Royal Navy transformed into a primarily [[Anti-submarine warfare|anti-submarine force]], hunting for [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] submarines and mostly active in the [[GIUK gap]]. Following the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union|collapse of the Soviet Union]], its focus has returned to [[Expeditionary warfare|expeditionary]] operations [[Standing Royal Navy deployments|around the world]] and it remains one of the world's foremost [[blue-water navy|blue-water navies]].<ref>Hyde-Price, ''European Security'', pp. 105–106.</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=The Royal Navy: Britain's Trident for a Global Agenda |date=4 November 2006 |url=http://henryjacksonsociety.org/2006/11/04/the-royal-navy-britains-trident-for-a-global-agenda/ |publisher=[[Henry Jackson Society]] |accessdate=4 November 2006 |quote=Britannia, with her shield and trident, is the very symbol, not only of the Royal Navy, but also of British global power. In the last instance, the Royal Navy is the United Kingdom's greatest strategic asset and instrument. As the only other 'blue-water' navy other than those of France and the United States, its ballistic missile submarines carry the nation's nuclear deterrent and its aircraft carriers and escorting naval squadrons supply London with a deep oceanic power projection capability, which enables Britain to maintain a 'forward presence' globally, and the ability to influence events tactically throughout the world. |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160911235404/http://henryjacksonsociety.org/2006/11/04/the-royal-navy-britains-trident-for-a-global-agenda/ |archive-date=11 September 2016 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Bennett|first1=James C|title=The Anglosphere Challenge: Why the English-speaking Nations Will Lead the Way in the Twenty-first Century|year=2007|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|location=United States|isbn=978-0742533332|page=286|quote=...the United States and the United Kingdom have the world's two best world-spanning blue-water navies... with the French being the only other candidate... and China being the most likely competitor in the long term}}</ref> However, 21st-century reductions in naval spending have led to a personnel shortage and a reduction in the number of warships.<ref>Axe, David (10 August 2016).

The Royal Navy maintains a fleet of technologically sophisticated ships, submarines, and aircraft, including two [[Queen Elizabeth-class aircraft carrier|aircraft carriers]], [[Albion-class landing platform dock|two amphibious transport docks]], four [[Vanguard-class submarine|ballistic missile submarines]] (which maintain the [[Nuclear weapons and the United Kingdom|UK's nuclear deterrent]]), seven nuclear [[fleet submarine]]s, six [[Type 45 destroyer|guided missile destroyer]]s, 13 [[Type 23 frigate|frigate]]s, 13 [[mine-countermeasure vessel]]s and 23 [[Patrol boat|patrol vessels]]. As of November 2020, there are [[List of active Royal Navy ships|76 operational commissioned ships]] (including submarines as well as one historic ship, [[HMS Victory]]) in the Royal Navy, plus 13 ships of the [[Royal Fleet Auxiliary]] (RFA); there are also five [[Merchant Navy (United Kingdom)|Merchant Navy ships]] available to the RFA under a [[private finance initiative]]. The RFA replenishes Royal Navy warships at sea, and augments the Royal Navy's amphibious warfare capabilities through its three {{sclass2-|Bay|landing ship|2}} vessels. It also works as a force multiplier for the Royal Navy, often doing patrols that frigates used to do. The total displacement of the Royal Navy is approximately 443,200 [[tonnes]] (819,200 tonnes including the Royal Fleet Auxiliary).

The Royal Navy is part of [[Her Majesty's Naval Service]], which also includes the [[Royal Marines]]. The professional head of the Naval Service is the [[First Sea Lord]] who is an [[Admiral (United Kingdom)|admiral]] and member of the [[Defence Council of the United Kingdom]]. The Defence Council delegates management of the Naval Service to the [[Admiralty Board (United Kingdom)|Admiralty Board]], chaired by the [[Secretary of State for Defence]]. The Royal Navy operates from three bases in the United Kingdom where commissioned ships and submarines are based: [[HMNB Portsmouth|Portsmouth]], [[HMNB Clyde|Clyde]] and [[HMNB Devonport|Devonport]], the last being the largest operational naval base in Western Europe, as well as two naval air stations, [[RNAS Yeovilton (HMS Heron)|RNAS Yeovilton]] and [[RNAS Culdrose (HMS Seahawk)|RNAS Culdrose]] where maritime aircraft are based.

<!-- This section is a [[WP:SUMMARY]]. The separate [[History of the Royal Navy (before 1707)]] has much greater detail -->
During much of the medieval period, fleets or "king's ships" were often established or gathered for specific campaigns or actions, and these would disperse afterwards. These were generally merchant ships enlisted into service. Unlike some European states, England did not maintain a small permanent core of warships in peacetime. England's naval organisation was haphazard and the mobilization of fleets when war broke out was slow.<ref>Rodger, ''Safeguard'', pp. 52–53, 117–130.</ref> In the 11th century, [[Æthelred the Unready|Aethelred II]] had an especially large fleet built by a national levy.<ref>Swanton, p. 138.</ref> During the period of Danish rule in the 11th century, the authorities maintained a standing fleet by taxation, and this continued for a time under [[Edward the Confessor]], who frequently commanded fleets in person.<ref>Swanton, pp. 154–165, 160–172.</ref> After the [[Norman Conquest]], English naval power waned and England suffered naval raids from the Vikings.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Medieval Maritime Wartime|last=Stanton|first=Charles|publisher=Pen & Sword Maritime|year=2015|location=South Yorkshire|pages=225–226}}</ref> In 1069, this allowed for the invasion and ravaging of England by Jarl Osborn (brother of [[Sweyn II of Denmark|King Svein Estridsson]]) and his sons.<ref>{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=-jigBwAAQBAJ&pg=PT422|title=Medieval Maritime Warfare|first= Charles D.|last= Stanton|publisher=Pen and Sword|year=2015|isbn=978-1781592519}}</ref>

The lack of an organised navy came to a head during the Baron's Revolt, in which [[Louis VIII of France|Prince Louis of France]] invaded England in support of northern barons. With [[John, King of England|King John]] unable to organise a navy, this meant the French landed at Sandwich unopposed in April 1216. John's flight to Winchester and his death later that year left [[William Marshal, 1st Earl of Pembroke|the Earl of Pembroke]] as regent, and he was able to marshal ships to fight the French in the [[Battle of Sandwich (1217)|Battle of Sandwich]] in 1217- one of the first major English battles at sea.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Historie des Dues de Normandie et des Rois d'Angleterre|last=Michel|first=F.|year=1840|location=Paris|pages=172–177}}</ref> The outbreak of the [[Hundred Years War]] emphasised the need for an English fleet. French plans for an invasion of England failed when [[Edward III of England]] destroyed the French fleet in the [[Battle of Sluys]] in 1340.<ref>Rodger, ''Safeguard'', pp. 93–99.</ref> England's naval forces could not prevent frequent raids on the south-coast ports by the French and their allies.

<!-- This section is a [[WP:SUMMARY]]. The separate [[History of the Royal Navy (before 1707)]] has much greater detail -->
A standing "Navy Royal",<ref name="auto"/> with its own secretariat, dockyards and a permanent core of purpose-built warships, emerged during the reign of Henry VIII.<ref>Rodger, ''Safeguard'', pp. 221–237.</ref> Under [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] England became involved in a war with Spain, which saw privately owned vessels combining with the Queen's ships in highly profitable raids against Spanish commerce and colonies.<ref>Rodger, ''Safeguard'', pp. 238–253, 281–286, 292–296.</ref> The Royal Navy was then used in 1588 to repulse the [[Spanish Armada]]. In 1603, the [[Union of the Crowns]] created a [[personal union]] between England and Scotland. While the two remained distinct sovereign states for a further century, the two navies increasingly fought as a single force. During the early 17th century, England's relative naval power deteriorated until [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] undertook a major programme of shipbuilding. His [[Ship money|methods of financing]] the fleet however contributed to the outbreak of the [[English Civil War]], and the [[interregnum|abolition of the monarchy]].<ref>Rodger, ''Safeguard'', pp. 379–394, 482.</ref>

The [[Commonwealth of England]] replaced many names and symbols in the new commonwealth navy, associated with royalty and the [[high church]], and expanded it to become the most powerful in the world.<ref>John Barratt, 2006, ''Cromwell's Wars at Sea''. Barnsley, South Yorkshire; Pen & Sword; pp.</ref><ref>Rodger, ''Command'', pp. 2–3, 216–217, 607.</ref> The fleet was quickly tested in the [[First Anglo-Dutch War]] (1652–1654) and the [[Anglo-Spanish War (1654-1660)]], which saw the conquest of [[Jamaica]] and successful [[Battle of Cadiz (1656)|attacks on Spanish treasure fleets]]. The 1660 [[The Restoration|Restoration]] saw [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] rename the Royal Navy again, and started use of the prefix [[Her Majesty's Ship|HMS]]. The navy however remained a national institution and not a possession of the crown as it had been before.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3CoVAAAAQAAJ&q=Charles+II+Royal+Navy&pg=PA82|title=Memoirs of the rise and progress of the Royal Navy|first=Charles|last=Derrick|year=1806|access-date=30 December 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171230230123/https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=3CoVAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA82&lpg=PA82&dq=Charles+II+Royal+Navy&source=bl&ots=27fSLeUXFx&sig=jEWt_1yZLomGC6JIK89HflZ5n-Q&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjupMTMhLLYAhViLsAKHU6vDzY4ChDoAQhVMAk|archive-date=30 December 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Following the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688, England joined the [[War of the Grand Alliance]]  which marked the end of France's brief pre-eminence at sea and the beginning of an enduring British supremacy.<ref>Rodger, ''Command'', pp. 142–152, 607–608.</ref>

In 1707, the Kingdom of Great Britain was formed by the [[Acts of Union 1707|Act of Union]], which had the effect of merging the Scottish navy into the Royal Navy. Throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, the Royal Navy was the largest maritime force in the world,<ref>Rodger, ''Command'', p. 608.</ref> maintaining superiority in financing, tactics, training, organisation, social cohesion, hygiene, logistical support and warship design.<ref>Rodger, ''Command'', pp. 291–311, 408–425, 473–476, 484–488.</ref> The peace settlement following the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] (1702–1714) granted Britain [[Gibraltar]] and [[Menorca]], providing the Navy with Mediterranean bases.

Between 1815 and 1914, the Navy saw little serious action, owing to the [[Pax Britannica|absence of any opponent strong enough]] to challenge its dominance. During this period, naval warfare underwent a comprehensive transformation, brought about by steam propulsion, metal ship construction, and explosive munitions. Despite having to completely replace its war fleet, the Navy managed to maintain its overwhelming advantage over all potential rivals. Due to British leadership in the [[Industrial Revolution]], the country enjoyed unparalleled shipbuilding capacity and financial resources, which ensured that no rival could take advantage of these revolutionary changes to negate the British advantage in ship numbers.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.historyextra.com/period/georgian/how-did-britain-come-to-rule-the-waves/|title=How did Britain come to rule the waves?|publisher=History Extra|accessdate=6 March 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190307054023/https://www.historyextra.com/period/georgian/how-did-britain-come-to-rule-the-waves/|archive-date=7 March 2019|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> In 1889, Parliament passed the [[Naval Defence Act 1889|Naval Defence Act]], which formally adopted the 'two-power standard', which stipulated that the Royal Navy should maintain a number of battleships at least equal to the combined strength of the next two largest navies.<ref>Sondhaus, p. 161.</ref> The end of the 19th century saw structural changes and older vessels were scrapped or placed into reserve, making funds and manpower available for newer ships.

===World Wars===
<!-- This section is a [[WP:SUMMARY]]. The separate [[History of the Royal Navy (after 1707)]] has much greater detail -->
During the [[First World War]], the Royal Navy's strength was mostly deployed at home in the [[British Grand Fleet|Grand Fleet]], confronting the German [[High Seas Fleet]] across the North Sea. Several inconclusive clashes took place between them, chiefly the [[Battle of Jutland]] in 1916.<ref>Geoffrey Bennett, "The Battle of Jutland" ''History Today'' (June 1960) 10#6 pp 395-405.</ref>  The British fighting advantage proved insurmountable, leading the High Seas Fleet to abandon any attempt to challenge British dominance.<ref>{{cite news|title= ''Distant Victory: The Battle of Jutland and the Allied Triumph in the First World War'', page XCIV |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=VlTmHeEYgxsC&q=battle+of+jutland+germany+wanted+access+to+the+atlantic&pg=PA94|date= July 2006|publisher= Praeger Security International|isbn = 9780275990732|accessdate= 30 May 2016}}</ref> In the inter-war period, the Royal Navy was stripped of much of its power.

In addition to new construction, several existing old battleships, battlecruisers and heavy cruisers were reconstructed, and anti-aircraft weaponry reinforced, while new technologies, such as [[ASDIC]], [[Huff-Duff]] and [[hydrophones]], were developed.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=azuIDwAAQBAJ&q=hydrophones+are+arranged+in+a+%22line+array%22&pg=PA39|title=Underwater Acoustic Signal Processing: Modeling, Detection, and Estimation|last=Abraham|first=Douglas A.|date=2019-02-14|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-319-92983-5|language=en}}</ref>

The Royal Navy suffered heavy [[List of Royal Navy losses in World War II|losses]] in the first two years of the war.

===Since 1945===
<!-- This section is a [[WP:SUMMARY]]. The separate [[History of the Royal Navy (after 1707)]] has much greater detail -->
After the Second World War, the decline of the [[British Empire]] and the [[Economic history of the United Kingdom#1945–2001|economic hardships in Britain]] forced the reduction in the size and capability of the Royal Navy. The [[United States Navy]] instead took on the role of global naval power. Governments since have faced increasing budgetary pressures, partly due to the [[Upward Spiral|increasing cost of weapons systems]].<ref>Kennedy, 1989, pp. 570–571.</ref> In 1981, Defence Secretary [[John Nott]] had advocated and initiated a [[1981 Defence White Paper|series of cutbacks to the Navy]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=%2Farts%2F2002%2F03%2F12%2Fboknot12.xml |title=We were heading for war...and the Commons blamed me |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date=1 March 2002 |accessdate=10 August 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060718081008/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=%2Farts%2F2002%2F03%2F12%2Fboknot12.xml |archive-date=18 July 2006 }}</ref> The [[Falklands War]] however proved a need for the Royal Navy to regain an expeditionary and [[littoral]] capability which, with its resources and structure at the time, would prove difficult. At the beginning of the 1980s, the Royal Navy was a force focused on [[Blue-water navy|blue-water]] [[anti-submarine warfare]]. Its purpose was to search for and destroy [[Soviet Navy#Submarines|Soviet submarines]] in the North Atlantic, and to operate the nuclear deterrent submarine force. The navy received its first nuclear weapons with the introduction of the first of the {{sclass-|Resolution|submarine|1}}s armed with the [[Polaris missile]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/nuke/guide/usa/slbm/a-1.htm|title=Polaris A1|accessdate=26 November 2017}}</ref>

===Post-Cold War===
Following the conclusion of the [[Cold War]], the Royal Navy began to experience a gradual decline in its fleet size in accordance with the changed strategic environment it operated in. While new and more capable ships are continually brought into service, such as the [[Queen Elizabeth-class aircraft carrier]], [[Astute-class submarine]], and [[Type 45 destroyer|Type 45]] [[destroyer]], the total number of ships and submarines operated has continued to steadily reduce. This has caused considerable debate about the size of the Royal Navy, with a 2013 report finding that the current RN was already too small, and that Britain would have to depend on her allies if her territories were attacked.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/385142/Royal-Navy-is-now-too-small-to-protect-Britain|title=Royal Navy is now 'too small' to protect Britain.|author=John Ingham|work=Express|accessdate=23 November 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141023222150/http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/385142/Royal-Navy-is-now-too-small-to-protect-Britain|archive-date=23 October 2014|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Following the retirement without replacement of the RAF's [[V bomber]] force in the 1980s, the Royal Navy also became solely responsible for the maintenance of the UK's [[Nuclear weapons and the United Kingdom|nuclear deterrent]]. The financial costs attached to nuclear deterrence have become an increasingly significant issue for the navy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.savetheroyalnavy.org/has-the-time-come-to-the-move-the-cost-of-trident-replacement-out-of-the-mod-budget/|title=Has the time come to the move the cost of Trident replacement out of the MoD budget?|date=27 November 2017|publisher=Save the Navy|accessdate=30 December 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171231002804/http://www.savetheroyalnavy.org/has-the-time-come-to-the-move-the-cost-of-trident-replacement-out-of-the-mod-budget/|archive-date=31 December 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

===Personnel===
[[File:BRNC-Dartmouth.jpg|thumb|Britannia Royal Naval College]]
{{HMS|Raleigh|shore establishment|6}} at [[Torpoint, Cornwall]], is the basic training facility for newly enlisted ratings. [[Britannia Royal Naval College]] is the initial officer training establishment for the navy, located at [[Dartmouth, Devon]]. Personnel are divided into a [[Officer Corps of the Royal Navy|warfare branch]], which includes Warfare Officers (previously named seamen officers) and [[Fleet Air Arm|Naval Aviators]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/careers/roles-and-specialisations/services/surface-fleet/warfare-officer|title=Welfate Officer|publisher=Royal Navy|access-date=9 May 2020}}</ref> as well other branches including the [[Royal Naval Engineers]], [[Royal Navy Medical Branch]], and [[Logistics Officer]]s (previously named [[Supply Officer]]s). Present-day officers and ratings have several different [[Royal Navy uniform]]s; some are designed to be worn aboard ship, others ashore or in ceremonial duties. Women began to join the Royal Navy in 1917 with the formation of the [[Women's Royal Naval Service]] (WRNS), which was disbanded after the end of the First World War in 1919. It was revived in 1939, and the WRNS continued until disbandment in 1993, as a result of the decision to fully integrate women into the structures of the Royal Navy. Women now serve in all sections of the Royal Navy including the [[Royal Marines]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1395974/First-woman-wins-Marines-green-beret.html|title=First woman wins Marines' green beret|date=1 June 2002|newspaper=The Telegraph|accessdate=30 December 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170809215001/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1395974/First-woman-wins-Marines-green-beret.html|archive-date=9 August 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

Initially, 16 Type 23 frigates were delivered to the Royal Navy, with the final vessel, {{HMS |St Albans|F83|6}}, commissioned in June 2002. However, the 2004 review of defence spending ([[Delivering Security in a Changing World]]) announced that three frigates of the fleet of sixteen would be [[paid off]] as part of a continuous cost-cutting strategy, and these were subsequently sold to the [[Chilean Navy]].<ref name="SellType23">''Grafton'' became ''Almirante Lynch'', ''Marlborough'' became ''Almirante Condell'', ''Norfolk'' became ''Almirante Cochrane'' {{cite web |url=http://www.helis.com/database/sys/469/ |title=Type 23 Duke class – Helicopter Database |publisher=helis.com |accessdate=23 March 2013 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160831042228/http://www.helis.com/database/sys/469/ |archive-date=31 August 2016 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The 2010 [[Strategic Defence and Security Review 2010|Strategic Defence and Security Review]] announced that the remaining 13 Type 23 frigates would eventually be replaced by the [[Type 26 Frigate]].<ref>{{cite web |title= Strategic Defence and Security Review – Securing Britain in an Age of Uncertainty |publisher=Ministry of Defence |url=http://www.direct.gov.uk/prod_consum_dg/groups/dg_digitalassets/@dg/@en/documents/digitalasset/dg_191634.pdf |accessdate=1 July 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101222022127/http://www.direct.gov.uk/prod_consum_dg/groups/dg_digitalassets/%40dg/%40en/documents/digitalasset/dg_191634.pdf |archive-date=22 December 2010}}</ref> The [[Strategic Defence and Security Review 2015]] reduced the procurement of Type 26 to eight with five [[Type 31 frigate|Type 31e frigate]]s to be procured.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/478933/52309_Cm_9161_NSS_SD_Review_web_only.pdf |title=National Security Strategy and Strategic Defence and Security Review 2015 |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=23 November 2015  |website=gov.uk |publisher=Cabinet Office }}</ref>

====Mine Countermeasure Vessels (MCMV)====
There are two classes of MCMVs in the Royal Navy: seven {{sclass-|Sandown|minehunter}}s and six {{sclass2-|Hunt|mine countermeasures vessel}}s. The Hunt-class vessels combine the separate roles of the traditional [[minesweeper]] and the active minehunter in one hull. If required, the ''[[Sandown-class minehunter|Sandown]]'' and [[Hunt-class mine countermeasures vessel|Hunt-class]] vessels can take on the role of offshore patrol vessels.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.navynews.co.uk/ships/echo.asp|title=Echoes of a varied history – HMS Echo, ship of the month May 2004 (archive)|publisher=Navy News|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080719190122/http://www.navynews.co.uk/ships/echo.asp|archive-date=19 July 2008|accessdate=20 June 2009}}</ref>

====Offshore Patrol Vessels (OPV)====

In 1997, three Batch 1 {{sclass2-|River|patrol vessel|4}} ships were procured; unusually, these were owned by [[VT Group|Vosper Thorneycroft]], and leased to the Royal Navy until 2013. This relationship was defined by a ground-breaking contractor logistic support contract which contracts the ships' availability to the RN, including technical and stores support. In November 2013, it was announced that in order to sustain shipbuilding capabilities on the Clyde, five new ocean-going patrol vessels with [[AgustaWestland AW101|Merlin-capable]] flight decks would be ordered for delivery from 2017. In October 2014, the Ministry of Defence announced the names of the first three ships as {{HMS|Forth|P222|6}}, [[HMS Medway (P223)|HMS ''Medway'']] and [[HMS Trent (P224)|HMS ''Trent'']].<ref>{{cite news|title=First steel cut on new patrol ships|url= https://www.gov.uk/government/news/first-steel-cut-on-new-patrol-ships|accessdate=11 October 2014|publisher=Ministry of Defence|date=10 October 2014|quote=The first of the new OPVs will be named HMS Forth and is expected to be handed over to the Royal Navy in 2017.

====Ballistic Missile Submarines (SSBN)====

The Royal Navy operates four {{sclass-|Vanguard|submarine|4}} [[ballistic missile submarine]]s displacing nearly 16,000 tonnes and equipped with [[Trident Missile|Trident II]] missiles (armed with [[Nuclear weapons and the United Kingdom|nuclear weapons]]) and heavyweight [[Spearfish torpedo]]es, with the purpose to carry out Operation Relentless, the United Kingdom's Continuous At Sea Deterrent (CASD). In December 2006, the Government published recommendations for a new class of four ballistic missile submarines to replace the current ''Vanguard'' class, starting 2024. Subsequently, that service entry date has slipped to the "early 2030s".<ref name="theyworkforyou1">{{cite web|author=a few days |url=https://www.theyworkforyou.com/wrans/?id=2020-01-30.10350.h&s=c |title=HMS Audacious: 6 Feb 2020: Hansard Written Answers |publisher=TheyWorkForYou |date=2020-02-06 |accessdate=2020-05-12}}</ref>  These new {{sclass-|Dreadnought|submarine|1}}s will mean that the United Kingdom will maintain a nuclear ballistic missile submarine fleet and the ability to launch nuclear weapons.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn10729 |title=UK unveils plans for a new submarine fleet |publisher=New Scientist (Environment) |last=Knight |first=Will |date=5 December 2006 |accessdate=10 August 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081208162915/http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn10729 |archive-date=8 December 2008 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

== Naval bases ==
{{See also|List of Royal Navy shore establishments}}
The Royal Navy currently uses three major naval port bases in the UK, each housing its own flotilla of ships and boats ready for service, along with two naval air stations and a support facility base in Bahrain:

===Bases in the United Kingdom===

*[[HMNB Devonport]] (HMS ''Drake'') – This is currently the largest operational naval base in Western Europe. [[Devonport, Plymouth|Devonport]]'s flotilla consists of the RN's two amphibious assault vessels (HM Ships ''Albion'' and ''Bulwark''), and half the fleet of [[Type 23 frigate]]s. Devonport also homes some of the RN's Submarines service, including two of the {{sclass-|Trafalgar|submarine|1}}s.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Trafalgar Class {{!}} Royal Navy|url=https://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/the-equipment/submarines/attack-submarines/trafalgar-class|access-date=2020-10-31|website=www.royalnavy.mod.uk|language=en}}</ref>

[[File:HMS Albion 2006.jpg|thumb|{{HMS|Albion|L14|6}} during HMNB Devonport’s Navy day, 2006.]]

*[[HMNB Portsmouth]] (HMS ''Nelson'') – This is home to the future Queen Elizabeth Class supercarriers. [[Portsmouth]] is also the home to the Type 45 Daring Class Destroyer and a moderate fleet of Type 23 frigates as well as [[Fishery Protection Squadron]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/our-organisation/where-we-are/naval-base/portsmouth|title=HMNB Portsmouth|publisher=Royal Navy|accessdate=30 December 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171230225809/https://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/our-organisation/where-we-are/naval-base/portsmouth|archive-date=30 December 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>
*[[HMNB Clyde]] (HMS ''Neptune'') – This is situated in Central Scotland along the [[River Clyde]]. Faslane is known as the home of the UK's nuclear deterrent, as it maintains the fleet of ''Vanguard''-class ballistic missile (SSBN) submarines, as well as the fleet of ''Astute''-class fleet (SSN) submarines. By 2020, Faslane will become the home to all Royal Navy submarines, and thus the RN Submarine Service. As a result, 43 Commando (Fleet Protection Group) are stationed in Faslane alongside to guard the base as well as The Royal Naval Armaments Depot at Coulport. Moreover, Faslane is also home to Faslane Patrol Boat Squadron (FPBS) who operates a fleet of Archer class patrol vessels.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/our-organisation/where-we-are/naval-base/clyde|title=HMNB Clyde|publisher=Royal Navy|accessdate=30 December 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171230230205/https://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/our-organisation/where-we-are/naval-base/clyde|archive-date=30 December 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/news-and-latest-activity/operations/united-kingdom/faslane-patrol-boat-squadron|title=Faslane Patrol Boat Squadron {{!}} Royal Navy|website=www.royalnavy.mod.uk|language=en|access-date=2020-01-05}}</ref>

===Current deployments===
{{Main|Standing Royal Navy deployments}}
The Royal Navy is currently deployed in different areas of the world, including some [[standing Royal Navy deployments]]. These include several home tasks as well as overseas deployments. The Navy is deployed in the Mediterranean as part of standing NATO deployments including mine countermeasures and NATO Maritime Group 2. In both the North and South Atlantic, RN vessels are patrolling. There is always a Falkland Islands patrol vessel on deployment, currently [[HMS Forth (P222)|HMS Forth]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/our-organisation/the-fighting-arms/surface-fleet/patrol/river-class/hms-forth|title=HMS Forth|publisher=Royal Navy|access-date=9 May 2020}}</ref>

The Royal Navy operates a [[Response Force Task Group]] (a product of the 2010 Strategic Defence and Security Review), which is poised to respond globally to short-notice tasking across a range of defence activities, such as non-combatant evacuation operations, disaster relief, humanitarian aid or amphibious operations. In 2011, the first deployment of the task group occurred under the name 'COUGAR 11' which saw them transit through the Mediterranean where they took part in multinational amphibious exercises before moving further east through the Suez Canal for further exercises in the Indian Ocean.<ref>[http://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/operations-and-support/operations/auriga/index.htm Cougar] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101211003029/http://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/operations-and-support/operations/auriga/index.htm |date=11 December 2010 }}.

Significant numbers of naval personnel are employed within the Ministry of Defence, Defence Equipment and Support and on exchange with the [[British Army|Army]] and [[Royal Air Force]]. Small numbers are also on exchange within other government departments and with allied fleets, such as the United States Navy. The navy also posts personnel in small units around the world to support ongoing operations and maintain standing commitments. Nineteen personnel are stationed in Gibraltar to support the small [[Gibraltar Squadron]], the RN's only permanent overseas squadron. Some personnel are also based at East Cove Military Port and [[RAF Mount Pleasant]] in the [[Falkland Islands]] to support APT(S). Small numbers of personnel are based in [[Diego Garcia]] (Naval Party 1002), Miami (NP 1011 – [[AUTEC]]), Singapore (NP 1022), [[Dubai]] (NP 1023) and elsewhere.<ref>[http://www.bfpo.mod.uk/bfponumbers_ships.htm British Forces Post Office – Ship/unit numbers] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100517063856/http://www.bfpo.mod.uk/bfponumbers_ships.htm |date=17 May 2010 }} 4 February 2011</ref>

On 6 December 2014, the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]] announced it would expand the UK's naval facilities in [[Bahrain]] to support larger Royal Navy ships deployed to the Persian Gulf. Once complete, it will be the UK's first permanent military base located [[East of Suez]] since it withdrew from the region in 1971. The base will reportedly be large enough to accommodate [[Type 45 destroyer|Type 45]] destroyers and [[Queen Elizabeth-class aircraft carrier|''Queen Elizabeth''-class]] aircraft carriers.<ref>{{cite news|title=UK-Bahrain sign landmark defence agreement|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-bahrain-sign-landmark-defence-agreement|accessdate=6 December 2014|publisher=Foreign & Commonwealth Office|date=5 December 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141209030053/https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-bahrain-sign-landmark-defence-agreement|archive-date=9 December 2014|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=UK to establish £15m permanent Mid East military base|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-30355953|accessdate=6 December 2014|work=BBC News|date=6 December 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171124233435/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-30355953|archive-date=24 November 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=East of Suez, West from Helmand: British Expeditionary Force and the next SDSR|url=http://www.oxfordresearchgroup.org.uk/sites/default/files/ORGDec14EastSuezWestHelmand_0.pdf|publisher=Oxford Research Group|accessdate=22 May 2015|date=December 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150702074143/http://www.oxfordresearchgroup.org.uk/sites/default/files/ORGDec14EastSuezWestHelmand_0.pdf|archive-date=2 July 2015|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

==Titles and naming==
[[File:HMS Richmond MOD 45155880.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Type 23 frigate]]s or "Duke class" are named after [[Duke#United Kingdom|British dukes]].]]

===Of the Navy===
The navy of the United Kingdom is commonly referred to as the "Royal Navy" both in the United Kingdom and other countries. Navies of other [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries [[Commonwealth realm|where the British monarch is also head of state]] include their national name, e.g. [[Royal Australian Navy]]. Some navies of other monarchies, such as the ''Koninklijke Marine'' ([[Royal Netherlands Navy]]) and ''Kungliga Flottan'' ([[Royal Swedish Navy]]), are also called "Royal Navy" in their own language. The Danish Navy stands out with the term Royal incorporated in its official name (Royal Danish Navy), but only using the term "Flåden" (Navy) in everyday speech.<ref>most books on the subject of the Royal Danish Navy</ref> The French Navy, despite France being a republic since 1870, is often nicknamed ''"La Royale"'' (literally: The Royal).<ref>{{Cite book|first=Jean|last=Randier|year=2006|title=La Royale : L'histoire illustrée de la Marine Nationale française|isbn=978-2-35261-022-9}}</ref>

===Of ships===
{{Main|List of ships of the Royal Navy}}
{{See also|List of active Royal Navy ships|Naming conventions for destroyers of the Royal Navy|Type system of the Royal Navy}}
Royal Navy ships in commission are prefixed since 1789 with [[Her Majesty's Ship]] ([[His Majesty's Ship]]), abbreviated to "HMS"; for example, {{HMS|Beagle}}. Submarines are styled HM Submarine, also abbreviated "HMS". Names are allocated to ships and submarines by a naming committee within the MOD and given by class, with the names of ships within a class often being thematic (for example, the [[Type 23 frigate|Type 23s]] are named after [[Duke#United Kingdom|British dukes]]) or traditional (for example, the {{sclass-|Invincible|aircraft carrier|1}}s all carry the names of famous historic ships). Names are frequently re-used, offering a new ship the rich heritage, battle honours and traditions of her predecessors. Often, a particular vessel class will be named after the first ship of that type to be built. As well as a name, each ship and submarine of the Royal Navy and the Royal Fleet Auxiliary is given a [[pennant number]] which in part denotes its role. For example, the destroyer {{HMS|Daring|D32|}} displays the pennant number 'D32'.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/The-Fleet/Ships/Destroyers/Type-45-Destroyers/HMS-Daring |title=HMS Daring |publisher=Royal Navy |accessdate=15 September 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120913114641/http://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/The-Fleet/Ships/Destroyers/Type-45-Destroyers/HMS-Daring |archive-date=13 September 2012 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

==Ranks, rates, and insignia==
{{See also|Royal Navy officer rank insignia|Royal Navy other rank insignia}}
The Royal Navy ranks, rates and insignia form part of the uniform of the Royal Navy. The Royal Navy uniform is the pattern on which many of the uniforms of the other national navies of the world are based (e.g. [[Ranks and insignia of NATO navies officers]], [[Uniforms of the United States Navy]], [[Uniforms of the Royal Canadian Navy]], [[French Navy#Uniforms|French Naval Uniforms]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.napoleon-series.org/research/biographies/France/Navy/c_Captains1.html|title=The French Navy and the Men Who Commanded It: Captains Who Served in the French Navy during the period 1791–1815|publisher=Napoleon Series|accessdate=30 December 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180107211759/http://www.napoleon-series.org/research/biographies/France/Navy/c_Captains1.html|archive-date=7 January 2018|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

[[File:Elizabeth II v pd.jpg|thumb|[[Queen Elizabeth II|The Queen]] and Admiral Sir Alan West during a [[Fleet review (Commonwealth realms)|Fleet Review]]]]

===Traditions===

The Royal Navy has several formal customs and traditions including the use of ensigns and ships badges. Royal Navy ships have several ensigns used when under way and when in port. Commissioned ships and submarines wear the [[White Ensign]] at the stern whilst alongside during daylight hours and at the main-mast whilst under way. When alongside, the ''Union Jack'' is flown from the [[jackstaff]] at the bow, and can only be flown under way either to signal a court-martial is in progress or to indicate the presence of an admiral of the fleet on-board (including the Lord High Admiral or the monarch).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fotw.net/flags/gb-use.html#sea |title=Use of the Union Jack at Sea |publisher=Flags of the World |accessdate=14 July 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070609111311/http://www.fotw.net/flags/gb-use.html#sea |archive-date=9 June 2007}}</ref>

The [[Fleet Review, Royal Navy|Fleet Review]] is an irregular tradition of assembling the fleet before the monarch. The first review on record was held in 1400, and the most recent review {{As of|2009|lc=on}} was held on 28 June 2005 to mark the bi-centenary of the Battle of Trafalgar; 167 ships from many different nations attended with the Royal Navy supplying 67.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article537597.ece |title=French top gun at Fleet Review |work=The Times |location=London |date=26 June 2005 |accessdate=12 July 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629111416/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article537597.ece |archive-date=29 June 2011 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

==="Jackspeak"===

There are several less formal traditions including service nicknames and Naval slang, known as ''"Jackspeak"''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gunplot.net/main/content/jack-speak-sailors-dictionary|title=Sailors' Dictionary |publisher=Gun Plot|access-date=9 May 2020}}</ref> The nicknames include "The Andrew" (of uncertain origin, possibly after a zealous [[Impressment|press ganger]])<ref>{{Cite book| title=Admiralty Manual of Seamanship |year=1964 |publisher=HMSO}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nmm.ac.uk/server/show/conWebDoc.17840 |title=FAQs;Royal Navy's nickname |publisher=National Maritime Museum |accessdate=14 July 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070629230746/http://www.nmm.ac.uk/server/show/conWebDoc.17840 |archive-date=29 June 2007}}</ref> and "The Senior Service".<ref name="jackspeak">{{Cite book|last=Jolly |first=Rick |title=Jackspeak |date=December 2000 |publisher=Maritime Books Dec 2000 |isbn=0-9514305-2-1}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.royal-navy.mod.uk/server/show/nav.3804 |title=Naval Slang |publisher=Royal Navy |accessdate=14 July 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070702221448/http://www.royal-navy.mod.uk/server/show/nav.3804 |archive-date=2 July 2007 }}</ref> British sailors are referred to as "Jack" (or "Jenny"), or more widely as "Matelots". Royal Marines are fondly known as "Bootnecks" or often just as "Royals". A compendium of Naval slang was brought together by Commander A. Covey-Crump and his name has in itself become the subject of Naval slang; [[Covey Crump]].<ref name="jackspeak" /> A game traditionally played by the Navy is the four-player board game known as "[[Uckers]]". This is similar to [[Ludo (board game)|Ludo]] and it is regarded as easy to learn, but difficult to play well.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uckers.co.uk/how2play.htm|title=The Basic Rules of Uckers|accessdate=12 September 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090213041503/http://www.uckers.co.uk/how2play.htm|archive-date=13 February 2009|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

==Navy Cadets==
