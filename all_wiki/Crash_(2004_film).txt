'''''Crash''''' is a 2004 American [[Crime film|crime]] [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] produced, directed, and co-written by [[Paul Haggis]]. The film features racial and social tensions in [[Los Angeles]]. A self-described "passion piece" for Haggis, ''Crash'' was inspired by a real-life incident in which his [[Porsche]] was [[Carjacking|carjacked]] in 1991 outside a video store on [[Wilshire Boulevard]].<ref>''Crash'' DVD Commentary Track. 2005.</ref> The film features an [[ensemble cast]], including [[Sandra Bullock]], [[Don Cheadle]], [[Matt Dillon]], [[Jennifer Esposito]], [[William Fichtner]],  [[Brendan Fraser]], [[Terrence Howard]], [[Ludacris|Chris "Ludacris" Bridges]], [[Thandie Newton]], [[Michael Peña]], and [[Ryan Phillippe]].

''Crash'' first premiered at the [[2004 Toronto International Film Festival]] on September 10, 2004 before it was released in theaters on May 6, 2005 by [[Lions Gate Films]]. The film received positive reviews from critics, who praised the directing, screenplay, performances (particularly from Dillon), but earned polarized responses for what some saw as an oversimplified depiction and portrayal of [[Racism in the United States|race relations]]. The film was profitable at the box office, earning $98.4 million worldwide against its $6.5 million budget. 

The film earned several accolades and nominations. Dillon was particularly praised for his performance and received nominations for Best Supporting Actor from the Academy Awards, BAFTA, Golden Globe, and Screen Actors Guild Award. Additionally, the cast won the [[Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture]]. The film received six [[Academy Award]] nominations, and controversially won three for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]], and [[Academy Award for Best Film Editing|Best Film Editing]] at the [[78th Academy Awards]]. It was also nominated for nine BAFTA Awards and won two, for [[BAFTA Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]] and [[BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role|Best Supporting Actress]] for Newton.

==Plot==
The movie begins with Detective Graham Waters and his partner Ria being involved in a minor collision with a car being driven by Kim Lee. A subsequent exchange of racially charged insults occurs. Waters arrives at a crime scene where the body of a "dead kid" has been discovered. Earlier the previous day, Farhad, a Persian shop owner, and his daughter Dorri are in a gun shop arguing over what cartridges they should buy. The gun store owner grows impatient and degrades the two of them by referring to Farhad as "[[Osama bin Laden|Osama]]". Farhad is forced to leave the store and Dorri becomes responsible for the choice. 

Later that night, two black men, Anthony and Peter, [[carjack]] [[District Attorney]] Rick Cabot and his wife Jean. At the couple's house, the Hispanic [[locksmith]] Daniel Ruiz overhears Jean arguing with Rick, demanding that the locks be changed again as she suspects that Daniel is a gangster due to his tattoos and outfit. Daniel places the keys of the new locks on the kitchen counter and leaves.

Sergeant John Ryan and his partner Officer Tom Hansen pull over an [[SUV]] being driven by director Cameron Thayer and his wife Christine, who was performing fellatio on him. After an intoxicated Christine mouths off to Ryan, he subjects the couple to a body search. Ryan molests Christine in front of her husband and Hansen, who watches in disgust. Ryan releases them with a warning after Cameron apologizes. 

In the carjacked SUV, Anthony and Peter hit a Korean man while passing a parked van, dump him in front of a hospital, and drive away. Daniel's next call is to replace a lock at Farhad's shop, but when Daniel warns Farhad that the real problem is the door, Farhad won't listen. The next day, Farhad finds that his store has been wrecked and defaced with graffiti. Waters, while having sex with Ria, gets a phone call from his mother with dementia, which leads to an argument about Ria's ethnicity. Waters later visits his mother, who asks him to find his missing younger brother.

Ryan comes across a car accident and as he crawls into the overturned vehicle, he finds Christine trapped. Although she resists frantically at first, with the help of his partner and spectators, Ryan pulls the terrified Christine out just as her car bursts into flames. Anthony and Peter carjack another Navigator, which happens to be Cameron's. Only after opening the door do they realize that Cameron is black. Police officers arrive on the scene and a chase ends with Cameron and Anthony in Cameron's car on a dead end residential street. Hansen is one of the pursuing officers and, out of guilt for the part he played in the assault of Cameron's wife, vouches for Cameron to be let off with a warning. Cameron expresses shame toward Anthony for his criminal lifestyle and drops him off near a bus stop.

Farhad locates Daniel's house and waits in ambush. He then confronts Daniel and shoots, but Daniel's daughter jumps into Daniel's arms, attempting to protect her father. Everyone watches in horror as Daniel clutches his daughter, but they soon realize that Farhad's gun was only loaded with blank rounds, leaving Daniel's daughter unharmed and the family retreats inside. Farhad tells his daughter that he believes the little girl was his guardian angel, preventing him from committing a terrible crime. He gives the gun to his daughter who is then seen going over near the cash register to retrieve the box of gun cartridges that her father had not known were actually blanks.

Hansen pulls over to pick up a hitchhiking Peter, who fled from the carjacking that took place earlier. Throughout the drive, Hansen becomes more and more suspicious of Peter's intentions. Peter offends Hansen by suddenly beginning to laugh, and when Peter reaches for his pocket, Hansen shoots. In Peter's hand is a statuette similar to the one on Hansen's dash and, horrified, Hansen hides the body in some nearby bushes and burns his car. Waters arrives at the scene with his partner and the connection is made that Peter is his missing brother and the "dead kid". Waters is [[disowned]] by his mother for not finding Peter alive. 

Anthony decides to steal the van of the Korean man he accidentally hit and, when he drops it off at a chop shop he frequents, he discovers a number of Cambodian immigrants locked in the back of the van. The chop shop owner offers him $500 per immigrant, but Anthony has other plans. After driving into [[Chinatown, Los Angeles|Chinatown]] and setting the Cambodian people free, he passes by a car crash where, once again, an exchange of racially charged insults takes place.

==Reception==

===Box office===
''Crash'' had a [[wide release]] on May 6, 2005, and was a box office success in the late spring of 2005. The film had a budget of $6.5 million (plus $1 million in financing).<ref name="BOM" /> Because of the financial constraints, director Haggis filmed in his own house, borrowed a set from the TV show ''[[Monk (TV series)|Monk]]'', used his car in parts of the film, and even used cars from other staff members.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}} The film grossed $53.4 million domestically, making back more than seven times its budget.<ref name="BOM" /> Despite its success in relation to its cost, ''Crash'' was the lowest-grossing film at the domestic box office to win [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] since ''[[The Last Emperor]]'' in 1987.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}

===Critical response===
{{Expand section|date=June 2017}}
On review aggregator website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has an approval rating of 74% based on 241 reviews, with an average score of 7.23/10. The site's critical consensus reads, "A raw and unsettling morality piece on modern angst and urban disconnect, ''Crash'' examines the dangers of bigotry and xenophobia in the lives of interconnected Angelenos."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1144992-crash |title=''Crash'' (2004) |work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |publisher=[[Fandango Media]] |accessdate=February 21, 2020 |archive-date=August 8, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200808175149/https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1144992-crash |url-status=live }}</ref> On [[Metacritic]], the film has a score of 69 out of 100, based on 36 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.metacritic.com/film/titles/crash?q=Crash |title=''Crash'' Reviews |work=[[Metacritic]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=April 30, 2010}}</ref> According to [[CinemaScore]], audiences gave the film a grade of "A−" on an A+ to F scale.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cinemascore.com/ |title=Crash |publisher=CinemaScore |accessdate=February 27, 2018 |archive-date=January 4, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150104063502/https://www.cinemascore.com/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

[[Roger Ebert]] gave the film 4/4 stars and described it as "a movie of intense fascination",<ref>{{cite news |author=Ebert, Roger |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20050505/REVIEWS/50502001/1023 |title=Crash |work=Chicago Sun-Times |publisher=RogerEbert.com |date=May 5, 2005 |accessdate=April 30, 2010 |archive-date=March 16, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130316034926/http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20050505%2FREVIEWS%2F50502001%2F1023 |url-status=live }}</ref> listing it as the best film of 2005.

Some later reviews of ''Crash'' have been less favorable. Cultural critic [[Ta-Nehisi Coates]] criticized the film as shallow and "unthinking," naming ''Crash'' "the worst film of the decade."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2009/12/worst-movie-of-the-decade/32759 |title=Worst Movie of the Decade |work=TheAtlantic.com |access-date=2017-03-06 |archive-date=2017-03-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170303082756/https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2009/12/worst-movie-of-the-decade/32759/ |url-status=live }}</ref> The film has been critiqued for depicting the Persian shopkeeper as a "deranged, paranoid individual who is only redeemed by what he believes is a mystical act of God."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.darkmatter101.org/site/2007/05/07/crash-and-the-city |title=Crash and the City |work=DarkMatter101.org |date=May 7, 2007 |accessdate=April 30, 2010 |archive-date=December 25, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091225222728/http://www.darkmatter101.org/site/2007/05/07/crash-and-the-city/ |url-status=live }}</ref> The film has also been criticized for using multicultural and sentimentalist imagery to cover over material and "historically sedimented inequalities" that continue to affect different racial groups in Los Angeles.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://filmcriticism.allegheny.edu/archives31_2.htm |title=Film Criticism Current Issue |work=FilmCriticism.Allegheny.edu |accessdate=April 30, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425142459/http://filmcriticism.allegheny.edu/archives31_2.htm |archivedate=April 25, 2012 }}</ref>

In 2010, the [[Independent Film & Television Alliance]] selected ''Crash'' as one of the 30 Most Significant Independent Films of the last 30 years.<ref>{{cite web | title = IFTA Picks 30 Most Significant Indie Films | url = http://www.thewrap.com/ifta-picks-30-most-significant-indie-films-20686/ | work = The Wrap | accessdate = January 23, 2017 | archive-date = February 6, 2017 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170206053204/http://www.thewrap.com/ifta-picks-30-most-significant-indie-films-20686/ | url-status = live }}</ref>

The film can be used as an example of the so-called 'network narrative', a non-linear way of storytelling that highlights the contingency of life and values the structure of society over the individual. The disconnect and conflicts portrayed in the film are highlighted by its unusual structure and present the possibility of the portrayed racism and bigotry being a result of structural behaviour that partially neglects the individual perspective and creates an abstract scale.

===Oscar controversy===
''Crash'' won the [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] Oscar at the [[78th Academy Awards]], controversially beating the critically favored ''[[Brokeback Mountain]]'' and making it only the second film ever (the other being ''[[The Sting]]'') to win the Academy Award for Best Picture without having been nominated for any of the three Golden Globe Awards for Best Motion Picture (Best Drama, Best Comedy/Musical and Best Foreign Film).

The film's use of moral quandary as a storytelling medium was widely reported as ironic, since many saw it as the "safe" alternative to ''Brokeback Mountain'', the plot of which focused on LGBT issues. Critic [[Kenneth Turan]] suggested that ''Crash'' benefited from anti-gay discomfort among Academy members,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://theenvelope.latimes.com/awards/oscars/env-turan5mar05,0,5359042.story |last=Turan |first=Kenneth |title=Breaking no ground: Why 'Crash' won, why 'Brokeback' lost and how the Academy chose to play it safe |work=The Los Angeles Times |date=March 5, 2006 |access-date=May 23, 2009 |archive-date=March 26, 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060326203621/http://theenvelope.latimes.com/awards/oscars/env-turan5mar05%2C0%2C5359042.story |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://goldderby.latimes.com/awards_goldderby/2009/04/maybe-crashs-upset-at-the-oscars-shouldnt-have-been-such-a-surprise.html |title=Maybe Crash's upset at the Oscars shouldn't have been such a surprise? |date=April 16, 2009 |work=The Los Angeles Times |access-date=May 23, 2009 |archive-date=January 13, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120113010233/http://goldderby.latimes.com/awards_goldderby/2009/04/maybe-crashs-upset-at-the-oscars-shouldnt-have-been-such-a-surprise.html |url-status=live }}</ref> while critic [[Roger Ebert]] was of a different opinion, arguing that the better film won that year.

''[[Film Comment]]'' magazine placed ''Crash'' first on their list of "Worst Winners of Best Picture Oscars", followed by ''[[Slumdog Millionaire]]'' at #2, and ''[[Chicago (2002 film)|Chicago]]'' at #3.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.filmcomment.com/article/extended-trivial-top-20 |title=Extended Trivial Top 20® |date=March–April 2012 |accessdate=October 12, 2012 |archive-date=March 11, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130311111139/http://www.filmcomment.com/article/extended-trivial-top-20 |url-status=live }}</ref> Similarly, a 2014 survey of film critics by ''[[The Atlantic]]'' identified the film's victory as among the most glaring mistakes made by the Academy Awards.<ref>Roumell, Graham, "What was the biggest Oscar mistake ever made?" https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2014/03/what-was-the-biggest-oscar-mistake-ever-made/357581/ {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170227232219/https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2014/03/what-was-the-biggest-oscar-mistake-ever-made/357581/ |date=2017-02-27 }} March 2014</ref>

In 2015, ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' polled hundreds of Academy members, asking them to re-vote on past controversial decisions. For the 2006 Best Picture winner, ''Brokeback Mountain'' beat ''Crash'' and the other nominees.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/recount-oscar-voters-today-would-773522|title=Recount!

In a 2015 interview, [[Paul Haggis]] commented: "Was [''Crash''] the best film of the year? I don't think so. There were great films that year. ''[[Good Night, and Good Luck]]'' – amazing film. ''[[Capote (film)|Capote]]'' – terrific film. Ang Lee's ''[[Brokeback Mountain]]'', great film. And Spielberg's ''[[Munich (film)|Munich]]''. I mean please, what a year. ''Crash'', for some reason, affected people, it touched people. And you can't judge these films like that. I'm very glad to have those Oscars. They're lovely things. But you shouldn't ask me what the best film of the year was because I wouldn't be voting for ''Crash'', only because I saw the artistry that was in the other films. Now however, for some reason that's the film that touched people the most that year. So I guess that's what they voted for, something that really touched them. And I'm very proud of the fact that ''Crash'' does touch you. People still come up to me more than any of my films and say: 'That film just changed my life.' I've heard that dozens and dozens and dozens of times. So it did its job there. I mean, I knew it was the social experiment that I wanted, so I think it's a really good social experiment. Is it a great film? I don't know".<ref>{{cite news|last=Child|first=Ben|title=Paul Haggis: Crash didn't deserve best picture Oscar|date=12 August 2015|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/aug/12/paul-haggis-crash-best-picture-oscar|accessdate=2 December 2016|archive-date=3 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161203064022/https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/aug/12/paul-haggis-crash-best-picture-oscar|url-status=live}}</ref>
