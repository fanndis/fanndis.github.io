{{Anchor|Fox in Canada}}
Fox and its affiliated companies operate many entertainment channels in international markets, although these do not necessarily air the same programming as the U.S. network. Most viewers in [[Canada]] have access to at least one U.S.-based Fox affiliate, either free-to-air or through a pay television provider, although Fox's [[Fox NFL|National Football League broadcasts]] and most of its [[prime time]] programming are subject to [[simultaneous substitution]] regulations for [[pay television]] providers imposed by the [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]] (CRTC) to protect rights held by domestically based networks.

Fox is named after what was then called (and still commonly referred to as) [[20th Century Fox]], its original corporate sibling before [[Acquisition of 21st Century Fox  by Disney|it was acquired by The Walt Disney Company]], and indirectly for producer [[William Fox (producer)|William Fox]], who founded one of the film studio's predecessors, [[Fox Film]]. Fox is a member of the [[North American Broadcasters Association]] and the [[National Association of Broadcasters]].

==History==
===Origins===
[[20th Century Fox]] had been involved in television production as early as the 1950s, producing several [[Broadcast syndication|syndicated programs]].<ref name="Boxoffice"/> Following the demise of the [[DuMont Television Network]] in August 1956, after it became mired in severe financial problems, the [[NTA Film Network]] was launched as a new "fourth network".<ref name="Boxoffice2">{{cite news|title=Fourth TV Network, for Films, is Created|url=https://issuu.com/boxoffice/docs/boxoffice_070756/8|newspaper=[[Boxoffice]]|page=8|date=July 7, 1956}}{{dead link|date=April 2011}}</ref> 20th Century Fox would also produce original content for the NTA network.<ref name="Boxoffice">{{cite news|title=Fox Buys Into TV Network; Makes 390 Features Available|url=https://issuu.com/boxoffice/docs/boxoffice_110356-1/8|newspaper=Boxoffice|page=8|date=November 3, 1956}}{{dead link|date=April 2011}}</ref> The film network effort would fail after a few years, but 20th Century Fox continued to dabble in television through its production arm, TCF Television Productions, producing series (such as ''[[Perry Mason (1957 TV series)|Perry Mason]]'') for the three major broadcast television networks (ABC, NBC, and CBS).

===1980s: Establishment of the network===

====Foundations====
The Fox network's foundations were laid in March 1985 through [[News Corporation (1980–2013)|News Corporation]]'s $255&nbsp;million purchase of a 50% interest in TCF Holdings, the parent company of the 20th Century Fox film studio. In May 1985, News Corporation, a media company owned by [[Australia]]n publishing magnate [[Rupert Murdoch]] that had mainly served as a [[newspaper]] publisher at the time of the TCF Holdings deal, agreed to pay $2.55&nbsp;billion to acquire [[Independent station (North America)|independent television stations]] in six major U.S. cities from the [[John Kluge]]-run broadcasting company [[Metromedia]]: WNEW-TV in [[New York City]], [[WTTG]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], [[KTTV]] in [[Los Angeles]], [[KRIV (TV)|KRIV-TV]] in [[Houston]], [[WFLD|WFLD-TV]] in [[Chicago]], and KRLD-TV in [[Dallas]]. A seventh station, ABC affiliate [[WCVB-TV]] in [[Boston]], was part of the original transaction but was spun off to the [[Hearst Television|Hearst Broadcasting]] subsidiary of the [[Hearst Corporation]] in a separate, concurrent deal as part of a [[right of first refusal]] related to that station's 1982 sale to Metromedia.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Another spin for TV's revolving door |url=https://worldradiohistory.com/Archive-BC/BC-1985/BC-1985-05-06.pdf |periodical= [[Broadcasting & Cable|Broadcasting]] |via=American Radio History |pages=39–40 |date=May 6, 1985 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=Life among the high rollers |url=https://worldradiohistory.com/Archive-BC/BC-1985/BC-1985-05-13.pdf |journal= Broadcasting |via=American Radio History |pages=36–39 |date=May 13, 1985 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=Hearst's rise in the ownership ranks |url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC/BC-1985/BC-1985-05-13-Page-0038.pdf |journal=Broadcasting |via=American Radio History |page=38 |date=May 13, 1985 }}{{dead link|date=January 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> (Two years later, News Corporation acquired WXNE-TV in that market from the [[Christian Broadcasting Network]] and changed its call letters to [[WFXT]].)

Because Metromedia (originally known as Metropolitan Broadcasting at its founding) was spun off from the failed DuMont Television Network, radio personality [[Clarke Ingram]] has suggested that the Fox network is a revival or at least a linear descendant of DuMont.<ref>{{cite web|author=Clarke Ingram|author-link=Clarke Ingram|title=The DuMont Television Network: Channel Nine|url=http://www.dumontnetwork.com/9.html|website=DuMontNetwork.com|access-date=November 16, 2020}}</ref> The former Metromedia stations WNEW (originally known as WABD) and WTTG were two of the three original owned-and-operated stations of the DuMont network, and the former base of DuMont's operations, the DuMont Tele-Centre in [[Manhattan]], eventually became the present-day Fox Television Center.

====Beginning of the network====
In October 1985, 20th Century Fox announced its intentions to form a fourth television network that would compete with ABC, CBS, and NBC. The plans were to use the combination of the Fox studios and the former Metromedia stations to both produce and distribute programming. Organizational plans for the network were held off until the Metromedia acquisitions cleared regulatory hurdles. Then, in December 1985, Rupert Murdoch agreed to pay $325&nbsp;million to acquire the remaining equity in TCF Holdings from his original partner, [[Marvin Davis]]. The purchase of the Metromedia stations was approved by the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) in March 1986; the call letters of the New York City and Dallas outlets were subsequently changed respectively to [[WNYW]] and [[KDAF]].<ref>{{cite journal|title=For the record |url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC/BC-1986/BC-1986-03-17-Page-0110.pdf |journal=Broadcasting |via=American Radio History |page=118 |date=March 17, 1986 }}{{dead link|date=January 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> These first six stations, then broadcasting to a combined reach of 22% of the nation's households, became known as the [[Fox Television Stations]] group. With the sole exception of KDAF (which was sold to [[Renaissance Broadcasting]] in 1995, at which time it became a charter affiliate of [[The WB]]), all of the original [[owned-and-operated station]]s ("O&Os") are still part of the Fox network today. Like the core O&O group, Fox's affiliate body initially consisted of independent stations (a few of which had maintained affiliations with ABC, NBC, CBS, or DuMont earlier in their existences). The local charter affiliate was, in most cases, that market's top-rated independent, however, Fox opted to affiliate with a second-tier independent station in markets where a more established independent declined the affiliation (such as [[Denver]], [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] and [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]]). Largely because of both these factors, Fox in a situation very similar to what DuMont had experienced four decades before had little choice but to affiliate with [[Ultra high frequency|UHF]] stations in all except a few (mainly larger) markets where the network gained clearance.<ref name="NYTimes1986">{{cite news|title=New Fox Network Signs Up 79 TV Stations Across U.S.|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/08/04/arts/new-fox-network-signs-up-79-tv-stations-across-us.html|agency=[[Associated Press]]|newspaper=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=August 4, 1986|accessdate=June 27, 2015}}</ref>

The Fox Broadcasting Company officially debuted with a [[soft launch]] at 11:00&nbsp;p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern]] and [[Pacific Time Zone|Pacific Time]] on Thursday, October 9, 1986. Its inaugural program was a [[late-night talk show]], ''[[The Late Show (1986 TV series)|The Late Show]]'', which was hosted by comedian [[Joan Rivers]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Fox's Barry Diller Gambles on a Fourth TV Network|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/05/arts/fox-s-barry-diller-gambles-on-a-fourth-tv-network.html|author=Aljean Harmetz|newspaper=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=October 5, 1986|accessdate=June 27, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MckrtLdSIxs|title=The Late Show with Joan Rivers debut episode|last=|first=|date=|website=Youtube|access-date=April 9, 2017}}</ref> After a strong start, ''The Late Show'' quickly eroded in the ratings, it was never able to overtake NBC stalwart ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson|The Tonight Show]]''. By early 1987, Rivers (and her then-husband [[Edgar Rosenberg]], the show's original [[executive producer]]) quit ''The Late Show'' after disagreements with the network over the show's creative direction, the program then began to be hosted by a succession of guest hosts. After that point, some stations that affiliated with Fox in the weeks before the April 1987 launch of its prime time lineup (such as [[WVTV-DT2|WCGV-TV]] in [[Milwaukee]] and [[WDRB|WDRB-TV]] in [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]]) signed affiliation agreements with the network on the condition that they would not have to carry ''The Late Show'' due to the program's weak ratings.

The network had its "[[grand opening]]" when it expanded its programming into prime time on April 5, 1987, inaugurating its Sunday night lineup with the premieres of the [[sitcom]] ''[[Married... with Children]]'' and the [[sketch comedy]] series ''[[The Tracey Ullman Show]]''. The premieres of both series were rebroadcast twice following their initial airings (at 7:00&nbsp;p.m. and 7:30&nbsp;p.m. Eastern/Pacific, respectively) that night, which [[Jamie Kellner]], who served as the network's president and Chief Operating Officer until his resignation in January 1993, stated would allow viewers to "sample FBC programming without missing ''[[60 Minutes]]'', ''[[Murder, She Wrote]]'', or the 8 o'clock movies".<ref>{{cite news|title=Fox to Premiere Prime-Time Shows|url=http://archive.newsok.com/olive/apa/oklahoman/SharedView.Article.aspx?href=DOK%2F1987%2F04%2F05&id=Ar14900&sk=68470E79|newspaper=[[The Oklahoman|The Sunday Oklahoman]]|publisher=Oklahoma Publishing Company|page=4 (''Television News'')|date=April 5, 1987|accessdate=June 14, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=THE MEDIA BUSINESS; Fox's Television Head Abruptly Resigns Post|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/05/business/the-media-business-fox-s-television-head-abruptly-resigns-post.html|author=Geraldine Fabrikant|newspaper=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=January 5, 1993|accessdate=June 14, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=FOX Launch|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8V77hUkPpgc|website=Youtube|accessdate=April 9, 2017}}</ref> Fox added one new show per week over the next several weeks, with the drama ''[[21 Jump Street]]'' and comedies ''[[Mr. President (TV series)|Mr. President]]'' and ''[[Duet (TV series)|Duet]]'' completing its Sunday schedule.<ref>{{cite web|title=A Fool's Utopia 3.11.10: A Look at FOX Sundays|url=http://www.411mania.com/movies/columns/132334/A-Fool%5C%5Cs-Utopia-3.11.10:-A-Look-at-FOX-Sundays.htm|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120721033806/http://www.411mania.com/movies/columns/132334/A-Fool%5C%5Cs-Utopia-3.11.10:-A-Look-at-FOX-Sundays.htm|url-status=dead|archive-date=July 21, 2012|author=Ron Martin|website=411mania.com|publisher=411mania.com, LLC|date=March 11, 2010}}</ref> On July 11, 1987, the network rolled out its Saturday night schedule with the premiere of the [[supernatural]] drama series ''[[Werewolf (TV series)|Werewolf]]'', which began with a two-hour [[television pilot|pilot movie]] event. Three other series were added to the Saturday lineup over the next three weeks: comedies ''[[The New Adventures of Beans Baxter]]'', ''[[Karen's Song]]'', and ''[[Down and Out in Beverly Hills (TV series)|Down and Out in Beverly Hills]]'' (the latter being an adaptation of the film of the same name). Both ''Karen's Song'' and ''Down and Out in Beverly Hills'' were canceled by the start of the [[1987–88 United States network television schedule|1987–88 television season]], the network's first fall launch, and were replaced by the sitcoms ''[[Second Chance (1987 TV series)|Second Chance]]'' and ''[[Women in Prison (TV series)|Women in Prison]]''.

In regards to its late night lineup, Fox had already decided to cancel ''The Late Show'', and had a replacement series in development, ''[[The Wilton North Report]]'', when the former series began a ratings resurgence under its final guest host, comedian [[Arsenio Hall]]. ''Wilton North'' lasted just a few weeks, however, and the network was unable to reach a deal with Hall to return as host when it hurriedly revived ''The Late Show'' in early 1988. ''The Late Show'' went back to featuring guest hosts, eventually selecting [[Ross Shafer]] as its permanent host, only for it to be canceled for good by October 1988, while Hall signed a deal with [[Paramount Television]] to develop his own syndicated late night talk show, ''[[The Arsenio Hall Show]]''. Fox aired the [[39th Primetime Emmy Awards]] and would air the next five editions.

Although the network had modest successes in ''Married... with Children'' and ''The Tracy Ullman Show'', several affiliates were disappointed with Fox's largely underperforming programming lineup during the network's first three years, [[KMSP-TV]] in [[Minneapolis]] and [[KPTV]] in [[Portland, Oregon]], both owned at the time by [[Chris-Craft Industries|Chris-Craft Television]], disaffiliated from Fox in 1988 (with KITN, now [[WFTC]]) and [[KPDX]] respectively replacing those stations as Fox affiliates), citing that the network's weaker program offerings were hampering viewership of their stronger syndicated slate.

At the start of the [[1989–90 United States network television schedule|1989–90 television season]], Fox added a third night of programming, on Mondays. The season heralded the start of a turnaround for Fox. It saw the debut of a [[mid-season replacement|midseason replacement]] series, ''[[The Simpsons]]'', an animated series that originated as a series of [[short film|shorts]] on ''The Tracey Ullman Show'', ranked at a three-way tie for 29th place in the Nielsen ratings, it became a breakout hit and was the first Fox series to break the Top 30. ''The Simpsons'', at 30 years as of 2018, is the longest-running American sitcom, the longest-running American animated program, and the longest-running American scripted primetime television series.

In 1989, Fox also first introduced the [[documentary film|documentary]] series ''[[Cops (TV series)|Cops]]'' and crime-focused magazine program ''[[America's Most Wanted]]'' (the latter of which debuted as a half-hour series as part of the network's mainly comedy-based Sunday lineup for its first season, before expanding to an hour and moving to Fridays for the 1990–91 season). These two series, which would become staples on the network for just over two decades, would eventually be paired to form the nucleus of Fox's Saturday night schedule beginning in the [[1994–95 United States network television schedule|1994–95 season]]. Meanwhile, ''Married... with Children'' which broke ground from other family sitcoms of the period as it centered on a dysfunctional lower-middle-class family, whose [[Al Bundy|patriarch]] often openly loathed his failures and being saddled with a wife and two children saw viewer interest substantially increase beginning in its third season after, in an [[Streisand effect|ironic twist]], [[Michigan]] homemaker [[Terry Rakolta]] lodged a [[boycott]] to force Fox to cancel the series after objecting to risque humor and sexual content featured in a [[Married... with Children (season 3)#ep41|1989 episode]]. ''Married...''{{'}}s newfound success led it to become the network's longest-running live-action sitcom, airing for 11 seasons.

===1990s: Rise into mainstream success and beginnings of rivalry with the Big Three===
Fox survived where DuMont and other attempts to start a fourth network had failed because it programmed just under the number of hours defined by the FCC to legally be considered a network. This allowed Fox to make revenue in ways forbidden to the established networks (for instance, it did not have to adhere to the [[Financial Interest and Syndication Rules]] that were in effect at the time), since during its first years it was considered to be merely a large group of stations. By comparison, DuMont had been saddled by numerous regulatory barriers that hampered its potential to grow, most notably a ban on acquiring additional stations, during an era when the FCC had much tighter ownership limits for television stations (limiting broadcasters to a maximum of five stations nationwide) than it did when Fox launched. In addition, Murdoch was more than willing to open his wallet to get and keep programming and talent. DuMont, in contrast, operated on a shoestring budget and was unable to keep the programs and stars it had.<ref>{{cite book|title=Television's Greatest Year: 1954|author=R. D. Heldenfels|publisher=Continuum|location=[[New York City]]|year=1994|pages=79–80|isbn=0-8264-0675-0}}</ref>

Most of the other startup networks that launched in later years (such as The WB, [[UPN]] and [[The CW]]) followed Fox's model as well. Furthermore, DuMont operated during a time when the FCC did not require television manufacturers to include UHF capability.<ref name="RTDNACSA">McDowell, W. [http://list.msu.edu/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0109b&L=aejmc&T=0&P=9926 Remembering the DuMont Network: A Case Study Approach]. College of Mass Communication and Media Arts, Southern Illinois University. Retrieved on December 28, 2006.</ref> In order to see DuMont's UHF stations, most people had to buy an expensive [[set-top box|converter]]. Even then, the signal quality was marginal at best compared to the signals of [[Very high frequency|VHF]] stations {{crossreference|(see also: {{section link|UHF television broadcasting|UHF vs VHF}}) }}. By the time Fox launched, cable allowed UHF stations to generally be on an equal footing with VHF stations.<ref name="NYTimes1986"/>

Although Fox was growing rapidly as a network and had established itself as a presence, it was still not considered a major competitor to the established "Big Three" broadcast networks, ABC, CBS, and NBC. From its launch, Fox had the advantage of offering programs intended to appeal toward a younger demographic adults between 18 and 49 years of age – and that were edgier in content, whereas some programs that were carried by the "Big Three" networks attracted an older-skewing audience. Until the early 1990s, when Fox expanded its programming to additional nights and outside prime time, most Fox stations were still essentially formatted as independent stations – filling their schedules with mainly first-run and acquired programming, and, during prime time, running either syndicated programs or, more commonly, movies on nights when the network did not provide programming. Few Fox stations carried local newscasts during the network's early years, unlike the owned-and-operated stations and affiliates of its established rivals. Those that did were mostly based in larger markets (including some of the network's O&Os) and retained newscasts that had aired for decades.  Even then, these news operations were limited to one newscast per day, following the network's prime time lineup.

On September 6, 1990, Fox reached an agreement with [[Tele-Communications, Inc.|TCI]] (the nation's largest cable company at the time) in which TCI systems in markets that were not served by an over-the-air Fox affiliate at the time would become charter affiliates of a cable-only national feed of the network known as [[Foxnet]].<ref name="Fox TCI deal">{{cite news|title=Fox Network Gets Cable Affiliates in Deal With TCI|url=https://articles.latimes.com/1990-09-07/business/fi-566_1_fox-affiliate|author=John Lippman|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|publisher=Times Mirror Company|date=September 7, 1990|accessdate=October 12, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=FOX BROADCASTING CO.

As Fox gradually headed towards carrying a full week's worth of programming in prime time through the addition of programming on Thursday and Friday nights at the start of the [[1990–91 United States network television schedule|1990–91 season]] the network's added offerings included the scheduling of ''The Simpsons'' opposite veteran NBC sitcom ''[[The Cosby Show]]'' as part of Fox's initial Thursday night lineup that fall (along with future hit ''[[Beverly Hills, 90210]]'', which would become the network's longest-running drama, airing for ten seasons) after only a half-season of success on Sunday nights. The show performed well in its new Thursday slot, spending four seasons there and helping to launch ''[[Martin (TV series)|Martin]]'', another Fox comedy that became a hit when it debuted in August 1992. ''The Simpsons'' returned to Sunday nights in the fall of 1994, and has remained there ever since.

The sketch comedy series ''[[In Living Color]]'', which debuted in April 1990, created many memorable characters and launched the careers of future movie stars [[Jim Carrey]], [[Jamie Foxx]], [[Damon Wayans]], [[Keenen Ivory Wayans]] and [[Jennifer Lopez]] (the latter of whom was a member of the show's dance troupe, the "Fly Girls"). The series also gained international prominence after Fox aired a special live episode in January 1992 as an [[Super Bowl counterprogramming|alternative to the halftime show]] during [[Super Bowl XXVI]], which was broadcast on CBS, marking the start of Fox's rivalry with the "Big Three" networks while popularizing the [[Counterprogramming (television)|counterprogramming]] strategy against the [[Super Bowl]] telecast.

The early and mid-1990s saw the debuts of several [[soap opera]]-style prime time dramas aimed at younger audiences that became quick hits, which, in addition to ''Beverly Hills, 90210'', included its adult-focused spin-off ''[[Melrose Place]]'' (which initially had a mediocre ratings performance, before viewership rose significantly midway through its first season following [[Heather Locklear]]'s addition to the cast) and family drama ''[[Party of Five]]''. The early and mid-1990s also saw the network launch several series aimed at a [[African Americans|black]] audience, which, in addition to ''Martin'', included the sitcom ''[[Living Single]]'' and [[police procedural]] ''[[New York Undercover]]''.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Stanley |first1=T.L. |title=Must-flee TV |journal=Mediaweek |date=8 April 1996 |volume=6 |issue=15 |page=9 |id={{ProQuest|213644280}} }}</ref>

Despite having a few successful shows like the science fiction drama ''[[The X-Files]]'', Fox still lacked credibility among viewers.<ref name="kcs20190206">{{Cite news |url=https://www.kansascity.com/sports/nfl/kansas-city-chiefs/article225279155.html |title=Kansas City Chiefs' tax returns provide rare look inside the business of pro football |last1=Hendricks |first1=Mike |date=2019-02-06 |work=The Kansas City Star |access-date=2019-02-10 |last2=Vockrodt |first2=Steve |language=en}}</ref> Even those working in television thought of the network as "the one that has that cartoon show" (''The Simpsons''). More than 85% of affiliates in 1993 were UHF stations. Fox became a viable competitor to the older networks when it won broadcast television rights to the [[National Football League]] away from [[NFL on CBS|CBS]]. In December 1993, Fox signed a contract with the NFL to televise games from the [[National Football Conference]]—which had been airing its games on CBS since [[1956 NFL season|1956]]—starting with the [[1994 NFL season|1994 season]].

Shortly afterward, News Corporation began striking affiliation deals with, and later purchasing, more television station groups. On May 23, 1994, Fox agreed to purchase a 20% stake in [[New World Pictures#New World Communications|New World Communications]], a television and film [[production company]] controlled by investor [[Ronald Perelman]] that had just recently entered into broadcasting through its 1993 purchase of seven stations owned by [[Storer Broadcasting|SCI Television]]. As a result of Fox acquiring a 20% minority interest in the company, New World signed an agreement to switch the affiliations of twelve stations (eight CBS affiliates, three ABC affiliates [ [[WBRC|two]] [[WGHP|of which]] were subsequently placed in a [[blind trust]] and then sold directly to Fox due to conflicts with FCC ownership rules], and [[WDAF-TV|one NBC affiliate]]) that it had either already owned outright or was in the process of acquiring from [[Taft Broadcasting|Citicasters]] and [[Hearst Television|Argyle Communications]] at the time to Fox starting in September 1994 and continuing as existing affiliation contracts with their existing major network partners expired.<ref name=nytbusinessdigest>{{cite news|title=Fox Will Sign Up 12 New Stations; Takes 8 from CBS|url= https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/24/us/fox-will-sign-up-12-new-stations-takes-8-from-cbs.html?pagewanted=4 |author=Bill Carter|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|date=May 24, 1994|accessdate=October 22, 2012|author-link = Bill Carter}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=Fox and the New World order |url=https://worldradiohistory.com/Archive-BC/BC-1994/BC-1994-05-30.pdf |first=Geoffrey|last= Foisie |journal=Broadcasting & Cable |publisher=[[Reed Business Information|Cahners Business Information]] |pages=6, 8 |date=May 30, 1994 |accessdate= }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=The FCC last week approved New World's plans to transfer WGHP-TV Greensboro, N.C., and WBRC-TV Birmingham, Ala., into a trust for eventual sale to Fox|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-16799904.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016073449/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-16799904.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=October 16, 2015|author=Kim McAvoy|periodical=Broadcasting & Cable|publisher=Cahners Business Information|via=HighBeam Research|date=April 10, 1995|accessdate=October 10, 2015}}</ref>

That summer, [[SF Broadcasting]], a [[joint venture]] between Fox and [[Savoy Pictures]] that was founded in March 1994, purchased four stations from Burnham Broadcasting ([[KHON-TV|three]] [[WALA-TV|NBC]] [[WLUK-TV|affiliates]] and [[WVUE-DT|one ABC affiliate]]);<ref>{{cite news|title=COMPANY NEWS; Fox Adds 3 Network-Affiliated Stations|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/27/business/company-news-fox-adds-3-network-affiliated-stations.html|author=Andy Meisler|newspaper=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=August 27, 1994}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Savoy partners to buy Fox affils|url=https://variety.com/1994/tv/news/savoy-partners-to-buy-fox-affils-119324/|author=Jim Benson|periodical=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|publisher=Cahners Business Information|date=March 17, 1994|accessdate=June 27, 2015}}</ref> through a separate agreement, those stations would also switch to Fox between September 1995 and January 1996 as existing affiliation agreements lapsed. These two deals were not the first instances in which a longtime "Big Three" station affiliated with Fox: the network scored its first major coup when it moved its [[Miami]] affiliation from charter affiliate WCIX (which became a CBS owned-and-operated station, now [[WFOR-TV]]) to NBC affiliate [[WSVN]] in January 1989, the result of a three-station affiliation swap spurred by NBC's purchase of longtime CBS affiliate [[WTVJ]]. Through the expansion of its news programming and a refocused emphasis on crime stories and sensationalistic reporting under [[news director]] [[Joel Cheatwood]], that switch helped the perennial third-place WSVN become a strong competitor in the Miami market.

The NFC contract, in fact, was the impetus for the affiliation deal with New World<ref name=nytbusinessdigest/> and SF Broadcasting's purchase of the Burnham stations, as Fox sought to improve local coverage of its new NFL package by aligning the network with stations that had more established histories and advertiser value than its charter affiliates. The deals spurred a series of affiliation realignments between all four U.S. television networks involving individual stations and various broadcasting groups such as those between CBS and [[Westinghouse Broadcasting|Group W]] (whose [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|corporate parent]] later bought the network in August 1995), and ABC and the [[E. W. Scripps Company]] (which owned [[KNXV-TV|three]] [[KSHB-TV|Fox]] [[WFTS-TV|affiliates]] that switched to either ABC or NBC as a result of the New World deal) affecting 30 television markets between September 1994 and September 1996. The two deals also had the side benefit of increasing local news programming on the new Fox affiliates, mirroring the programming format adopted by WSVN upon that station's switch to the network (as well as expanding the number of news-producing stations in Fox's portfolio beyond mainly charter stations in certain large and mid-sized markets).

With significant market share for the first time ever and the rights to the NFL, Fox firmly established itself as the nation's fourth major network. Fox Television Stations would acquire New World outright on July 17, 1996 in a $2.48&nbsp;billion stock purchase, making the latter's twelve Fox affiliates owned-and-operated stations of the network;<ref>{{cite news|title=New World Vision : Murdoch's News Corp. to Buy Broadcast Group|url=https://articles.latimes.com/1996-07-18/business/fi-25271_1_rupert-murdoch-s-news-corp|author=Brian Lowry|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|publisher=Times Mirror Company|date=July 18, 1996|accessdate=June 22, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=THE MEDIA BUSINESS;Murdoch's News Corp.

Later, in August 2000, Fox bought several stations owned by Chris-Craft Industries and its subsidiaries [[BHC Communications]] and United Television for $5.5&nbsp;billion (most of these stations were UPN affiliates, although its Minneapolis station KMSP-TV would rejoin Fox in September 2002 as an owned-and-operated station).<ref>{{cite news|title=News Corp. to Buy Chris-Craft Parent for $5.5 Billion, Outbidding Viacom|url=https://articles.latimes.com/2000/aug/12/business/fi-3272|author=Sallie Hofmeister|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|publisher=Times Mirror Company|date=August 12, 2000|accessdate=March 23, 2011}}</ref> These purchases, for a time, made Fox Television Stations the largest owner of television stations in the U.S. (a title that has since been assumed by the [[Sinclair Broadcast Group]], one of the network's largest affiliate groups).

====Evolving programming====
Fox completed its prime time expansion to all seven nights on January 19, [[1992–93 United States network television schedule|1993]], with the launch of two additional nights of programming on Tuesdays and Wednesdays (The method of gradually adding nights to the programming schedule that began with the network's April 1987 prime time launch was replicated by The WB and UPN when those networks debuted in January 1995). September 1993 saw the heavy promotion and debut of a short-lived [[western (genre)|western]] series that incorporated science-fiction elements, ''[[The Adventures of Brisco County, Jr.]]'' However, it was the supernatural investigative drama that debuted immediately following it on Friday nights, ''[[The X-Files]]'', that would find long-lasting success, and would become Fox's first series to crack Nielsen's year-end Top 20 most-watched network programs. After several other failed attempts at late night programming following the cancellation of ''The Late Show'' (most notably, the quick failure of ''[[The Chevy Chase Show]]'' in 1993), Fox finally found success in that time period with the debut of ''[[MADtv]]'' on October 14, 1995; the sketch comedy series became a solid competitor to NBC's ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' for over a decade and was the network's most successful late night program as well as one of its most successful Saturday night shows, running for 14 seasons until 2009.

An attempt to make a larger effort to program Saturday nights by moving ''Married... with Children'' from its longtime Sunday slot and adding a new but short-lived sitcom (''[[Love and Marriage (1996 TV series)|Love and Marriage]]'') to the night at the beginning of the [[1996–97 United States network television schedule|1996–97 season]] backfired with the public, as it resulted in a brief cancellation of ''America's Most Wanted'' that was criticized by law enforcement and public officials, and was roundly rejected by viewers, which brought swift cancellation to the newer series.<ref>{{cite news|title=Day 'Most Wanted' was canceled|url=http://www.nypost.com/p/entertainment/tv/day_most_wanted_was_canceled_yq6gF5snMkKkT48hBp41jO|author=Maxine Shen|newspaper=[[New York Post]]|publisher=[[News Corporation (1980–2013)|News Corporation]]|date=March 5, 2010|accessdate=October 9, 2011}}</ref> ''Married...'' quickly returned to Sundays (before moving again to Mondays two months later); both it and ''Martin'' would end their runs at the end of that season. The Saturday schedule was revised in November 1996, to feature one new and one encore episode of ''Cops'', and the revived ''America's Most Wanted: America Fights Back''. ''Cops'' and ''AMW'' remained the anchors of Fox's Saturday lineup, making it the most stable night in American broadcast television for over 14 years; both shows eventually were among the few first-run programs remaining on Saturday evenings across the four major networks after decreasing prime time viewership – as more people opted to engage in leisure activities away from home rather than watch television on that night of the week led ABC, NBC and CBS to largely abandon first-run series on Saturdays (outside [[newsmagazine]]s, sports and [[burning off|burned off]] prime time shows that failed on other nights) in favor of reruns and movies by the mid-2000s. ''America's Most Wanted'' ended its 22-year run on Fox in June 2011, and was subsequently picked up by [[Lifetime (TV network)|Lifetime]] (before being cancelled for good in 2013);<ref>{{cite web|title=The Dramatic Re-Enactment: Transcript |url=http://www.onthemedia.org/2011/jun/03/dramatic-re-enactment/transcript/ |author=Bob Garfield |website=On The Media |publisher=[[WNYC]]/New York Public Radio |date=June 3, 2011 |accessdate=October 24, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120406080341/http://www.onthemedia.org/2011/jun/03/dramatic-re-enactment/transcript/ |archivedate=April 6, 2012 }}</ref> ''Cops'', in turn, would move its first-run episodes to [[Paramount Network|Spike]] in 2013 after 23 seasons (ending its original run on Fox as the network's longest-running prime time program) and would be cancelled in 2020, leaving sports and repeats of reality and drama series as the only programs airing on Fox on Saturday evenings.<ref>{{cite web|title='Cops' moving from Fox to Spike TV|url=https://articles.washingtonpost.com/2013-05-06/lifestyle/39061971_1_median-age-cops-spike|author=Lisa de Moraes|newspaper=The Washington Post|publisher=The Washington Post Company|date=May 6, 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130510204140/http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2013-05-06/lifestyle/39061971_1_median-age-cops-spike|archivedate=May 10, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

During the [[1997–98 United States network television schedule|1997–98 season]], Fox had three shows in the Nielsen Top 20 (in terms of total viewers), ''The X-Files'' (which ranked 11th), ''[[King of the Hill]]'' (which ranked 15th) and ''The Simpsons'' (which ranked 18th). Building around its flagship animated comedy ''The Simpsons'', Fox would experience relative success with animated series in prime time, beginning with the debut of the [[Mike Judge]]-produced ''King of the Hill'' in 1997. ''[[Family Guy]]'' (the first of three [[adult animation|adult-oriented animated series]] from [[Seth MacFarlane]] to air on the network) and ''[[Futurama]]'' (from ''Simpsons'' creator [[Matt Groening]]) would make their debuts in 1999, however, they were canceled in 2002 and 2003 respectively. Due to strong DVD sales and highly rated cable reruns on [[Cartoon Network]]'s [[Adult Swim]], Fox later decided to order new episodes of ''Family Guy'', which began airing in 2005. ''Futurama'' would be revived with four direct-to-DVD films between 2007 and 2009 and would return as a first-run series on [[Comedy Central]], where it ran from 2010 to 2013. Less successful efforts included ''[[The Critic]]'', starring ''Saturday Night Live'' alumnus [[Jon Lovitz]] (which Fox picked up in 1994 after it was cancelled by ABC, only for the series to be cancelled again after its second season), and ''[[The PJs]]'' (which moved to The WB in 2000, after Fox cancelled that series after its second season). Other notable shows that debuted in the late 1990s included the quirky [[David E. Kelley]]-produced live-action [[Comedy-drama|dramedy]] ''[[Ally McBeal]]'', the short-lived game show ''[[Greed (game show)|Greed]]'', and the period comedy ''[[That '70s Show]]'', the latter of which became Fox's second-longest-running live-action sitcom, airing for eight seasons.

Throughout the 1990s and into the next decade, Fox launched a slate of cable channels beginning with the 1994 debuts of general entertainment network [[FX (TV channel)|FX]] and movie channel FXM: Movies from Fox (now [[FX Movie Channel]]), followed by the debut of [[Fox News Channel]] in August 1996. Its sports operations expanded with the acquisition of controlling interests in several [[regional sports network]]s (including the [[Prime Network]] and [[SportsChannel]]) between 1996 and 2000 to form [[Fox Sports Networks|Fox Sports Net]] (which launched in November 1996), its 2000 purchase of Speedvision (later Speed Channel, which was replaced in the United States by [[Fox Sports 1]] in August 2013, however, it continues to exist in other North American and [[The Caribbean|Caribbean]] countries as [[Fox Sports Racing]]), and the launches of Fox Sports World (later [[Fox Soccer]], which was replaced by [[FXX]] in September 2013) and Fox Sports en Español (now [[Fox Deportes]]) in the early 2000s.

===2000s: Rise to ratings leadership, the ''American Idol'' effect, and fierce rivalry with CBS===
By 2000, many staple Fox shows of the 1990s had ended their runs. During the late 1990s and carrying over into the early 2000s, Fox put much of its efforts into producing [[reality television|reality]] shows many of which were considered to be sensationalistic and controversial in nature – such as ''[[Who Wants to Marry a Multi-Millionaire?]]'', ''[[Temptation Island (TV series)|Temptation Island]]'', ''[[Married by America]]'', and ''[[Joe Millionaire]]'' (which became the first Fox program ever to crack the Nielsen Top 10), as well as video clip shows such as ''[[World's Wildest Police Videos]]'' and ''[[When Animals Attack!]]''. After shedding most of these programs, Fox gradually filled its lineup with acclaimed dramas such as ''[[24 (TV series)|24]]'', ''[[The O.C.]]'', ''[[House (TV series)|House]]'', and ''[[Bones (TV series)|Bones]]'', and comedies such as ''[[The Bernie Mac Show]]'', ''[[Malcolm in the Middle]]'', and ''[[Arrested Development (TV series)|Arrested Development]]''.

As the decade wore on, Fox began surpassing ABC and NBC in the ratings, first in age demographics, then in overall viewership, and placed second behind a resurgent CBS in total viewership, beginning in [[2001–02 United States network television schedule|2002]]. Fox hit a major milestone in [[2004–05 United States network television schedule|2005]] when it emerged as the most-watched U.S. broadcast network in the lucrative 18–49 demographic for the first time, largely boosted by the strength of the reality singing competition series ''[[American Idol]]''. Regarded as the single most dominant program on 21st-century U.S. television, as well as the first Fox show to lead the Nielsen seasonal ratings, ''Idol'' had peak audiences of up to 38&nbsp;million viewers during the [[American Idol season 2|2003 season finale]] and double-season average audiences of around 31&nbsp;million viewers in [[American Idol (season 5)|2006]] and [[American Idol (season 6)|2007]]. Subsequently, it leapfrogged over Fox's Big Three competition to become the highest-rated U.S. television program overall starting with the [[American Idol (season 3)|2003–04 season]], becoming the first reality singing competition series in the country ever to reach first place in the seasonal ratings.

''Idol'' remains the most recent U.S. television program to date to lead the national prime time ratings and attract at least 30&nbsp;million viewers for at least two television seasons. It is the most watched program on U.S. television by seasonal average viewership in the 2000s decade, as well as the most recent program scheduled to have successfully established a [[graveyard slot]] on U.S. television since the end of NBC's ''[[Friends]]'' in 2004 and the subsequent decline of the network's previously dominant "[[Must See TV]]" Thursday timeblock. By 2005, reality television succeeded sitcoms as the most popular form of entertainment in the U.S. as a result of Fox's rise with ''Idol'' and NBC's network declines. ''House'', which aired as ''Idol'''s lead-out program on Tuesday nights, earned international prominence in the 21st century and became Fox's first prime time drama series (and the network's third program overall) to reach the Nielsen Top 10 beginning [[2005–06 United States network television schedule|2006]].

Beginning [[2003–04 United States network television schedule|2004]], CBS and Fox, which ranked as the two most-watched broadcast networks in the U.S. during the 2000s, have tended to equal one another in [[Demographics|demographic ratings]] among general viewership, with both networks winning certain demographics by narrow margins; however, while Fox has the youngest-skewing viewer base, CBS is consistently regarded to have the oldest audience demographics among the major broadcast networks. Fox hit a milestone in February 2005 by scoring its first-ever [[Nielsen ratings#Sweeps|sweeps]] victory in total viewership and demographic ratings, boosted largely by its broadcast of [[Super Bowl XXXIX]] and the strengths of ''American Idol'', ''24'', ''House'', and ''The O.C''.

In September 2006, as a result of the increasing number of over-the-air Fox affiliates and the increased availability of digital subchannels carrying Fox in certain markets, Foxnet was discontinued. Then, a sweeping milestone came by the conclusion of the [[2007–08 United States network television schedule|2007–08 season]] on May 21, 2008, shortly after the widely acclaimed [[American Idol (season 7)|seventh-season finale]] of ''American Idol'', when Fox outranked longtime leader CBS as the most watched television network overall in the United States, attributed to the strengths of [[Super Bowl XLII]] and its NFL game coverages, ''Idol'' and ''House'' during that season. To date, Fox is the only non-Big Three network to top the overall Nielsen ratings since its inception in the [[1950-1951 United States network television schedule|1950–51 season]].<ref name="wapo"/>

In the late 2000s, Fox launched a few series that proved to be powerful hits in different respects. In 2007, the network began production on the game shows ''[[Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader?]]'' and ''[[Don't Forget the Lyrics]]''; both shows ran for a total of three seasons each, making them the longest-running game shows in Fox's history. In 2008, the supernatural mystery series ''[[Fringe (TV series)|Fringe]]'' debuted to moderate ratings but earned critical acclaim during its first season on Tuesdays. Throughout its run, the series developed a large loyal fanbase that turned the show into a cult favorite. In 2009, ''[[Glee (TV series)|Glee]]'' premiered to average ratings when its pilot aired as a lead-out program of the [[American Idol (season 8)|eighth-season finale]] of ''American Idol'', but earned positive reviews from critics. The cast of the series has been acknowledged by notable luminaries such as the [[President of the United States]] [[Barack Obama]] and [[Oprah Winfrey]], who have each asked the cast to perform live for various national events.

===2010–2017: Network's ratings collapse and revamp in network programming===
At the dawn of the 2010s, new comedies ''[[Raising Hope]]'' and ''[[New Girl]]'' gave Fox its first live-action comedy successes in years. The [[Glee (season 2)|second season]] of ''Glee'' delivered that series' highest ratings during the [[2010–11 United States network television schedule|2010–11]] season, with viewership peaking during its [[List of Super Bowl lead-out programs|Super Bowl lead-out]] [[The Sue Sylvester Shuffle|episode]] in February 2011 (marking the most expensive post-Super Bowl episode ever produced on U.S. television). The said show has continuously attracted worldwide media attention that it formed a large, loyal international fanbase. At the same time, Fox's live telecast of the [[Super Bowl XLV]] helped the network emerge as the first U.S. television network to earn an average single-night prime time audience of at least 100&nbsp;million viewers.<ref>{{cite news|title=Super Bowl XLV Most Watched TV Show; Post-Game 'Glee' Trails 'Undercover Boss'|url=https://deadline.com/2011/02/the-super-bowl-tied-as-highest-rated-ever-104171/|author=Nellie Andreeva|website=Deadline.com|publisher=Penske Media Corporation|date=February 2011|accessdate=September 14, 2014}}</ref>

''American Idol'' lost its first place standing among all network prime time programs during the [[American Idol (season 11)|2011–12 finale]] (falling to second that season behind ''[[NBC Sunday Night Football]]''), ending the [[List of most watched television broadcasts|longest streak at#1]] for a prime time broadcast network series in U.S. television history, through its eight-year ratings domination in both the Adults 18–49 demographic and total viewership. ''Idol'' also remained in the Nielsen Top 10 for eleven years from [[2002–03 United States network television schedule|2003]] to [[2012–13 United States network television schedule|2013]], and became the highest-rated non-[[broadcasting of sports events|sports]] prime time television program as well as the highest-rated reality series in the U.S. from 2003 to 2012. these records marked the longest Nielsen ratings streaks of any Fox program in these categories.

The 2012 season finale of ''American Idol'' marked the end of the season-long 25th anniversary of the establishment of Fox network, helping it win in the 18–49 demographic for the eighth consecutive season, the longest such streak according to Nielsen measurement records (and still standing as of {{CURRENTYEAR}}). However, Fox suffered a collapse in viewership during the [[2012-13 United States network television schedule|2012–13 season]]; ''American Idol'' and ''Glee'' suffered steep ratings declines, while the network as a whole fell to third place (suffering an overall decrease by 22%) in total viewership and to second place in the 18–49 demographic (where it remained {{as of|2014|lc=y}}) by the end of the season.

The decline in ratings continued into the [[2013–14 United States network television schedule|2013–14 season]], with Fox placing fourth among the major networks in total viewership for the first time since [[2000–01 United States network television schedule|2001]]. Subsequently, on January 13, 2014, Fox announced that it would abandon its use of the standard concept of greenlighting shows through the initial order of pilot episodes during the designated "pilot season" (running from January through April), instead opting to pick up shows directly to series.<ref>{{cite news|title=Fox to abandon pilot system, reveals network's chairman Kevin Reilly|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/tv/news/a543703/fox-to-abandon-pilot-system-reveals-networks-chairman-kevin-reilly.html|author=Meg Drewett|website=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hearst Corporation|Hearst Magazines UK]]|date=January 13, 2014}}</ref>

Fox scored renewed ratings successes with its February 2014 live telecast of [[Super Bowl XLVIII]], which became the [[List of most watched television broadcasts|second most watched television broadcast]] (by average) in U.S. history, and the lead-out programs that followed this event – ''New Girl'' and ''[[Brooklyn Nine-Nine]]''. Later, in May 2014, [[Kevin Reilly (executive)|Kevin Reilly]] announced that he would resign as chairman of Fox Entertainment.<ref>{{cite news|title=Outgoing Fox Chief Kevin Reilly on Why He is Leaving, the State of Fox, What's Next, Job at Turner|url=https://www.deadline.com/2014/05/outgoing-fox-chief-kevin-reilly-on-why-he-is-leaving-the-state-of-fox-whats-next-job-at-turner/|author=Nellie Andreeva|website=Deadline.com|publisher=Penske Media Corporation|date=May 2014}}</ref> On July 15, 2014, corporate parent [[21st Century Fox]] announced that it would merge the operations of the network and [[20th Century Fox Television]] into the newly created Fox Television Group, with 20th Century Fox Television co-chairpersons [[Dana Walden]] and Gary Newman appointed to head the division.<ref>{{cite news|title=Dana Walden and Gary Newman to Lead New Fox Television Group|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/15/business/media/dana-walden-and-gary-newman-to-lead-new-fox-television-group.html?_r=0|author=Emily Steel|newspaper=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=July 15, 2014}}</ref>

The [[2014–15 United States network television schedule|2014–15 season]] saw the series finale of ''Glee'' and debut of hits in the freshmen dramas ''[[Gotham (TV series)|Gotham]]'' (based on the [[Batman]] mythos) and the [[Lee Daniels]]-produced ''[[Empire (2015 TV series)|Empire]]''. Ratings for ''Empire'', in particular, increased week-to-week throughout its first season, becoming the network's first successful ''American Idol'' lead-out since ''House'', as well as the first American television program to consistently increase its episode-to-episode viewership during its first five weeks since the [[1991–92 United States network television schedule|1992]] feat set by ABC's ''[[Roseanne (TV series)|Roseanne]]''. ''Empire'' ended its inaugural season as the first U.S. television show ever to increase its episodic viewership on a consistent basis throughout the course of a single season, as well as Fox's fourth program overall (and the first since the [[American Idol (season 12)|2013 finale]] of ''American Idol'') to enter the Nielsen Top 10 by the end of the 2014–15 season.<ref>{{cite web|title=Fox's 'Empire' Sets Growth Standard|url=http://www.tvnewscheck.com/article/83608/foxs-empire-sets-growth-standard|author=David Bauder|agency=Associated Press|website=TVNewsCheck|publisher=NewsCheck Media|date=March 10, 2015|accessdate=March 12, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Empire Finale Ratings Are Here and Just Bonkers|url=http://www.eonline.com/news/637444/empire-finale-ratings-are-here-and-just-bonkers|author=Chris Harnick|website=[[E!|E!

The [[2015–16 United States network television schedule|2015–16 season]] marked a notable turnaround for Fox, as it jumped ahead of ABC to third place in nationwide ratings (both in overall viewership and in the 18–49 demo) and posted several firsts for the network and on U.S. television. Its improvement was boosted by the transfer of the [[Miss Universe]] and [[Miss USA]] pageants from NBC, as well as shows such as ''[[Grease: Live]]'', ''Empire'' and the return of ''[[The X-Files]]'' after its most recent season ending in 2002. ''Grease: Live'' became the first live American TV musical special of the 21st century to be broadcast in front of a live studio audience (as well as the first ever live musical special aired by a non-Big Three network on primetime).

By 2016, ''[[Empire (season 2)|Empire]]'' and ''[[The X-Files (season 10)|The X-Files]]'' ranked in the Nielsen Top 10 for the season, the first season with 2 Fox programs entering the top rankings since the ''American Idol''-''House'' tandem of the 2007–2008 season (and the first ever season that Fox achieved such rankings without ''American Idol'' or any other reality television show from Fox in the Top 10). The same year also marked the [[American Idol (season 15)|finale]] of ''American Idol'' in its original run on Fox after airing for fifteen seasons, ending an era of one of the most successful shows in U.S. television history.

In February 2017, Fox broadcast [[Super Bowl LI]], which attracted an average 111.3 million viewers—ranking among the top five most-watched Super Bowl games, and the second-highest audience in network history behind Super Bowl XLVIII.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Perez|first=A.

It was acknowledged that Fox had placed a larger emphasis on its sports programming in its first upfronts since the deal was announced, including the acquisitions of the NFL's ''[[Thursday Night Football]]'' package and rights to the [[FIFA World Cup]]. It was also noted that Fox had been increasingly pivoting towards programs that could generate large audiences, as opposed to ones that become successful primarily through critical acclaim.

In August 2018, Fox Television Group CEO Dana Walden outlined how the network would operate following the transition to New Fox. The network will commission and acquire series from "independent" studios (such as [[Lionsgate]], [[MGM Television]], [[Sony Pictures Television]], and [[Warner Bros.]], the last of which being a co-owner of The CW with CBS but not outright owning a major broadcast network). Walden noted that the [[vertical integration]] of the major broadcast networks (including Fox itself) with associated studios had limited opportunities for outside studios, and cited several top programs that were distributed by third-parties, such as ''[[The Big Bang Theory]]'' and ''[[This Is Us]]'' (produced by [[Warner Bros. Television]] and 20th Television for CBS and NBC respectively). There are also plans for Fox to acquire new pitches directly from their writers, and offer them to outside producers. As part of the transition, Fox aimed to gradually reduce the amount of scripted programming development coming from 20th Century Fox Television, although stalwarts such as ''The Simpsons'' will remain with the network.<ref name="deadline-newfoxindie">{{Cite news|url=https://deadline.com/2018/08/new-fox-plans-independent-studios-program-ownership-tca-dana-walden-gary-newman-1202438665/|title=Fox Bosses Lay Out "New Fox" Plans To Court Independent Studios, Take Program Ownership – TCA|last=Andreeva|first=Nellie|date=2018-08-02|work=Deadline|access-date=2018-08-02|language=en-US}}</ref>

==Programming==
{{Main|List of programs broadcast by Fox}}
{{As of|2015}}, Fox currently provides 19 hours of regularly scheduled network programming each week. The network provides fifteen hours of prime time programming to its owned-and-operated and affiliated stations on Monday through Saturdays from 8:00 to 10:00&nbsp;p.m. and Sundays from 7:00&nbsp;p.m. to 10:00&nbsp;p.m. (all times Eastern and Pacific). An hour of late night programming is also offered on Saturdays from 11:00&nbsp;p.m. to 12:00&nbsp;a.m. Eastern and Pacific Time, a former hour of original comedy, but currently a repeat hour for primetime series (though scheduling for that hour varies depending on the market due to late local newscasts airing in the traditional 11:00&nbsp;p.m./10:00&nbsp;p.m. timeslot on some Fox stations). Weekend daytime programming consists of the [[infomercial|paid programming]] block ''[[Weekend Marketplace]]'' (airing Saturdays from 10:00&nbsp;a.m. to 12:00&nbsp;p.m., although the block is not carried by all affiliates and, in some areas, is offered to another station in the market), and the hour-long [[Sunday morning talk shows|Sunday morning political discussion show]] – and the network's only regular national news program – ''[[Fox News Sunday]] with [[Chris Wallace]]'' (airing from 9:00&nbsp;a.m. to 10:00&nbsp;a.m. Eastern and Pacific, although the timeslot also varies by market due to local news or [[public affairs (broadcasting)|public affairs]] programming).

Sports programming is also provided; usually on weekends (albeit not every weekend year-round), and most commonly airing between 11:00&nbsp;a.m. and 4:00&nbsp;p.m. or as late as 8:00&nbsp;p.m. on Sundays (often airing for longer hours during the National Football League season, slightly less during [[NASCAR]] season); between 12:00&nbsp;p.m. and 7:00&nbsp;p.m. (during [[Major League Baseball|baseball]], [[college football]], and [[college basketball]] season) on Saturday afternoons; and during prime time on certain Saturday evenings. The Saturday prime time block if any sports programming is scheduled for a particular week on that night currently varies between occasional [[Premier Boxing Champions]] events, Major League Baseball, or NASCAR coverage in the late winter and early spring/summer, and [[Fox College Football|college football coverage]] during the fall.

===Adult animation===

Except for ''[[Futurama]]'', which was cancelled in 2003, typically every Sunday night during prime time (unless preempted, usually by sports telecasts), Fox airs a lineup incorporating original adult animation series, all being produced (or co-produced with Fox for post-2019 works) by the network's original sister company, 20th Television, which is currently a subsidiary of [[Walt Disney Television]]. This block of adult cartoons became a staple of the network airing under the brand ''[[Animation Domination]]'' from May 1, 2005 to September 14, 2014, when the network rebranded the block as ''Sunday Funday'' as a result of the re-incorporation of live-action comedy series on the Sunday night lineup after ten years<ref>{{cite web|title=Why Sunday Funday Will Probably Be Animation Domination Again By Next Year|url=https://www.cinemablend.com/television/Why-Sunday-Funday-Probably-Animation-Domination-Again-By-Next-Year-67537.html|author=Jesse Carp|website=Cinema Blend|publisher=Cinema Blend LLC|date=September 26, 2014|accessdate=June 27, 2015}}</ref> (aside from occasional burn-offs of series aired on other nights during the 7:00&nbsp;p.m. Eastern/Pacific hour), although animated series remain an integral part of that night's schedule.

Animated shows currently airing as part of the lineup include ''The Simpsons'', ''Family Guy'', ''[[Bob's Burgers]]'', ''[[Bless the Harts]]'', and ''[[Duncanville (TV series)|Duncanville]]''. In addition to ''King of the Hill'', series that have previously aired on the lineup have included ''[[Sit Down, Shut Up (2009 TV series)|Sit Down, Shut Up]]'', ''[[Napoleon Dynamite (TV series)|Napoleon Dynamite]]'', and ''[[The Cleveland Show]]''.

Fox began airing children's programming on September 8, 1990 with the debut of the Fox Children's Network (rebranded as the Fox Kids Network in 1991, and then to simply [[Fox Kids]] in 1998), a [[block programming|programming block]] that aired on [[Saturday morning cartoon|Saturday mornings]] and [[Weekday cartoon|weekday afternoons]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Fox network will test a new idea in airing children's programs|url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1990/07/28/page/59/article/fox-network-will-test-a-new-idea-in-airing-childrens-programs|author=Eric Mink|newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]]|publisher=[[Tribune Publishing]]|date=July 28, 1990|accessdate=June 27, 2015}}</ref> Programming within the Fox Kids block consisted mainly of animated series, although it also featured some live-action series as part of the lineup. Shows featured in the block included ''[[Bobby's World]]'', ''[[X-Men (TV series)|X-Men]]'', ''[[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|Spider-Man]]'', ''[[The Tick (1994 TV series)|The Tick]]'', ''[[Fun House (American game show)|Fun House]]'', ''[[Goosebumps (TV series)|Goosebumps]]'' and ''[[Digimon Adventure|Digimon]]''; it also aired select shows from [[Warner Bros. Animation]] including the popular animated series ''[[Tiny Toon Adventures]]'', ''[[Animaniacs]]'' and ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'' (Warner Bros. pulled ''Batman'' and ''Animaniacs'' from the Fox Kids lineup in September 1995, moving both shows, as well as ''Tiny Toons'' – which had already ended its run – to the newly launched [[Kids' WB]] block on The WB). Fox Kids' most successful series, however, was ''[[Mighty Morphin Power Rangers]]'' (from eventual sister company and Fox Kids co-parent [[Saban Entertainment]]), which debuted in 1993 and became the block's flagship program until it moved to ABC and [[Toon Disney]] in 2002.

In October 2001, Fox sold its children's division, Saban Entertainment and [[ABC Family Worldwide|Fox Family Worldwide]] (the parent subsidiary of cable network Fox Family Channel, now [[Freeform (TV channel)|Freeform]]) to The Walt Disney Company for $5.3&nbsp;billion.<ref>{{cite web|title=News Corp. and Haim Saban Reach Agreement to Sell Fox Family Worldwide to Disney for $5.3 Billion |url=http://www.saban.com/html/press/010723.html |website=[[Saban Entertainment]] |date=July 23, 2001 |accessdate=February 19, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090421070416/http://www.saban.com/html/press/010723.html |archivedate=April 21, 2009 }}</ref> The network relegated the Fox Kids block to Saturdays in January 2002 (turning over the two-hour timeslot held by the weekday block to its owned-and-operated and affiliated stations, rather than retaining the slots and filling them with adult-oriented daytime shows<ref>{{cite news|title=Fox outgrows kids programs|url=https://www.variety.com/article/VR1117855508.html?categoryid=14&cs=1&query=|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120914072218/http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117855508.html?categoryid=14&cs=1&query=|url-status=dead|archive-date=September 14, 2012|author=Michael Schneider|website=Variety|publisher=Reed Business Information|date=November 7, 2001|accessdate=August 13, 2009}}</ref>); then on September 14, 2002, as part of a time-lease agreement with [[4Licensing Corporation|4Kids Entertainment]] to program the remaining four-hour Saturday morning lineup, Fox Kids was replaced by a new children's program block called FoxBox (which was renamed [[4Kids TV]] in February 2005).

Fox discontinued the 4Kids TV block on December 27, 2008, due to conflicts between the network and 4Kids Entertainment that were later settled, regarding 4Kids' failure to pay Fox for the programming lease rights, and the network's inability to fulfill a promise guaranteeing clearance on 90% of its stations and to get other stations to carry the block in certain markets where a Fox station declined it (an issue that plagued Fox's children's program blocks since the start of its affiliation deal with New World Communications).<ref>{{cite news|title=Fox Ends Saturday-Morning Cartoons |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/25/business/media/25kidstv.html |newspaper=The New York Times |publisher=The New York Times Company |date=November 24, 2008 |accessdate=January 11, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403021926/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/25/business/media/25kidstv.html |archivedate=April 3, 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref> Fox had earlier announced, on November 23, that it would no longer carry children's programming in the time period, citing stiff competition from cable channels aimed at the demographic; the network instead turned over two of the four vacant Saturday morning hours to its affiliates to allow them to air local newscasts or [[E/I|educational programs]] purchased from the syndication market, while it retained the remaining two hours to run a network-managed paid programming block, ''Weekend Marketplace'', which debuted on January 3, 2009.<ref name="variety">{{cite news|title=Longform ads replace kid fare on Fox|url=https://www.variety.com/article/VR1117996360.html?categoryid=14&cs=1|author=Michael Schneider|website=Variety|publisher=Reed Business Information|date=November 23, 2008|accessdate=June 17, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100903022442/http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117996360.html?categoryid=14&cs=1|archive-date=September 3, 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref>

On September 13, 2014, ''[[Xploration Station]]'', a two-hour syndicated block produced by [[Steve Rotfeld Productions]], began airing on Fox stations owned by several affiliate groups including Fox Television Stations and [[Tribune Broadcasting]]. The block, which complies with guidelines defined by the [[Children's Television Act]], features programs focused on the [[STEM fields]].<ref name="xploration">{{cite web|title=Steve Rotfield Clears New Science and Technology Two Hour E/I Block With FOX Station Group|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2013/12/18/steve-rotfield-clears-new-science-and-technology-two-hour-ei-block-with-fox-station-group/223509/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131222140946/http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2013/12/18/steve-rotfield-clears-new-science-and-technology-two-hour-ei-block-with-fox-station-group/223509/|url-status=dead|archive-date=December 22, 2013|author=Amanda Kondolojy|website=TV by the Numbers|date=December 18, 2013|accessdate=June 29, 2014}}</ref> Stations can choose to either carry ''Xploration Station'' or continue to air ''[[Weekend Marketplace]]'' (as the Sinclair Broadcast Group chose to do, since it already carries syndicated E/I programming purchased by the company across its Fox affiliates, although Sinclair added the block on most of its Fox affiliates in September 2016).

===News===
{{See also|Fox News}}
Unlike ABC, CBS, and NBC, Fox does not currently air national news programs (morning, evening or overnight) or [[News magazine#Broadcast news magazines|newsmagazine]]s choosing to focus solely on its prime time schedule, sports and other ancillary network programming. The absence of a national news program on the Fox network is despite the fact that its parent company, Fox Corporation, owns [[Fox News|Fox News Channel]], which launched in October 1996 and currently maintains near-universal distribution within the United States via pay television providers. Fox News is not structured as a news division of the Fox network, and operates as a technically separate entity within Fox Corporation through the company's Fox News Group subsidiary. However, it does produce some content that is carried by the broadcast network, which is usually separate from the news coverage aired by the cable channel; in particular, FNC anchor [[Bill Hemmer]] anchors most prime time news presentations on the Fox network, especially during political news events (which are anchored by [[Bret Baier]] on Fox News Channel).

Specifically, the Fox network airs coverage of the [[State of the Union address]], [[United States presidential election debates|presidential debates]], national election coverage, as well as live [[breaking news]] coverage currently branded as a "Fox News Special Report" (also branded as a "Fox News Alert" or sometimes a "Fox News Red Alert"); carriage of such special coverage of a breaking news story may vary from station to station, and is often limited to events that occur during the network's usual prime time block (for example, unlike the Big Three, Fox does not often provide coverage of major [[political convention]] speeches, which usually occur during the 10:00&nbsp;p.m. (Eastern Time) hour during which most of its affiliates air local newscasts; however, the majority of Fox's owned-and-operated stations and affiliate groups do carry weekday breaking news briefs). The political discussion show ''Fox News Sunday'' also airs on the Fox network on Sunday mornings and is rebroadcast later in the day on FNC. Fox also operates an affiliate news service called Fox NewsEdge,<ref>{{cite web|title=Fox NewsEdge|url=https://www.foxnewsedge.com/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030124204427/http://foxnewsedge.com/|url-status=dead|archive-date=January 24, 2003|website=Fox NewsEdge|publisher=Fox News Network, LLC|accessdate=June 27, 2015}}</ref> which launched with Fox News Channel in 1996, and provides national and international news reports, and feature stories for Fox stations to use in their own local newscasts.

Fox first tried its hand at a national news program in prime time with the hour-long weekly newsmagazine ''[[The Reporters (1988 TV program)|The Reporters]]'', which was produced by the same team behind the Fox Television Stations-distributed syndicated tabloid program ''[[A Current Affair (American TV program)|A Current Affair]]'';<ref>{{cite news|title=A Nose For Tabloid News "The Reporters" Offers Teasing Sensations And Tales Reminiscent Of Supermarket Checkout Lines|url=http://articles.philly.com/1988-08-13/news/26255071_1_sad-tale-tawdry-tales-reporters|author=Ken Tucker|newspaper=[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]|publisher=[[Knight Ridder]]|date=August 13, 1988|accessdate=June 27, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=New Fox Newsmagazine Perfects 'Tabloid TV'|url=http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1988/New-Fox-Newsmagazine-Perfects-Tabloid-TV-/id-14869d1c6bc32b52f3ddc058978aefec|author=Kathryn Baker|agency=[[Associated Press]]|date=July 28, 1988|accessdate=June 27, 2015}}</ref> the program ran from 1988 to 1990, when it was cancelled due to low ratings. From 1987 until about 1996, Fox also aired news capsules that aired within its prime time schedule, branded first as ''Fox News Extra'', and later as ''Fox News Updates'', which were produced at New York City O&O WNYW and used their anchors. Another failed attempt occurred in 1993, when Fox launched ''[[Front Page (newsmagazine)|Front Page]]'' (which included among its five hosts, [[Ron Reagan]] and [[Josh Mankiewicz]]), in an attempt to capture a younger demographic for a newsmagazine program.<ref>{{cite news|title=Fox News To Launch 'Front Page' With An Eye To Younger Viewers|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1993-06-26/entertainment/9306260023_1_fox-style-ron-reagan-newsmagazine|author=Stephen Galloway|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|publisher=Tribune Publishing|via=The Hollywood Reporter|date=June 26, 1993|accessdate=June 27, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Fox's 'Front Page' slithers its way into tabloid-TV|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1993-06-26/features/1993177099_1_paramount-tabloid-tv-con-artists|author=David Zurawik|newspaper=[[Baltimore Sun]]|publisher=Tribune Publishing|date=June 26, 1993|accessdate=June 27, 2015}}</ref>

The network tried its hand at a newsmagazine again in 1998 with ''Fox Files'', hosted by Fox News Channel anchors [[Catherine Crier]] and [[Jon Scott]], as well as a team of correspondents;<ref>{{cite news|title=FOX OFFERS ANOTHER NEWSMAG, 'FOX FILES'|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/tv/1998/07/12/fox-offers-another-newsmag-fox-files/c0f3083a-9a13-4cd0-a2ff-48859c72cc18/|newspaper=The Washington Post|publisher=The Washington Post Company|date=July 12, 1998|accessdate=June 27, 2015}}</ref> it lasted a little over a year before being cancelled. Its last attempt at a newsmagazine series occurred during the 2002–03 [[Sweeps|sweeps period]], with ''The Pulse'', hosted by Fox News Channel anchor Shepard Smith.<ref>{{cite news|title='The Pulse' bets newsmagazines still have one|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2002-07-11/features/0207110308_1_fox-report-fox-files-fox-news-channel|author=Allan Johnson|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|publisher=Tribune Publishing|date=July 11, 2002|accessdate=June 27, 2015}}</ref> On May 17, 2016, the network aired an interview special with then Fox News primetime anchor [[Megyn Kelly]], ''Megyn Kelly Presents''.

Fox also attempted national morning programs, only the first of which aired on the network itself. Its first venture at such a program was ''Fox After Breakfast'', an hour-long morning news and lifestyle show, hosted by [[Tom Bergeron]], [[Laurie Hibberd]], and [[Vicki Lawrence]], that ran on the network from 1996 to 1998 (Fox aired the program at 9:00&nbsp;a.m. – as opposed to the 7:00&nbsp;a.m. to 9:00&nbsp;a.m. time slot that NBC, CBS, and ABC air their national morning shows – in order to accommodate local morning newscasts that ran in the latter slot on some of its stations); the program originated as ''Breakfast Time'' in 1995 on sister cable channel FX. Fox tried again in 2002 with ''[[Good Day Live]]'', a heavily entertainment-focused syndicated offshoot of ''[[Good Day L.A.]]'', a news/entertainment/lifestyle program that debuted in 1993 on Los Angeles owned-and-operated station KTTV;<ref>{{cite news|title=L.A. morning show bids 'Good Day' to whole country|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2002-07-07/entertainment/0207070491_1_jillian-barberie-morning-show-day-live|author=Jay Bobbin|agency=Tribune Media Services|newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]]|publisher=[[Tribune Publishing]]|date=July 7, 2002|accessdate=June 27, 2015}}</ref> the national version of the program was cancelled in 2005. On January 22, 2007, Fox premiered ''[[The Morning Show with Mike and Juliet]]'' on its owned-and-operated stations; hosted by [[Mike Jerrick]] and [[Juliet Huddy]] (then-anchors of Fox News Channel's ''[[DaySide]]''), the show was lighter in format and more entertainment-oriented, though its focus often changed when a major news story occurred. In February 2007, the program was syndicated to other stations including many affiliated with ABC, NBC and CBS in markets where it was not carried by a Fox or [[MyNetworkTV]] affiliate; ''The Morning Show'' was cancelled in June 2009.<ref>{{cite web|title=Official Website : Where To Watch?|url=http://www.mandjshow.com/where-to-watch/|website=[[The Morning Show with Mike and Juliet]]|publisher=[[News Corp.

===Sports===
{{Main|Fox Sports (United States)}}
{{see also|Fox Sports 1|Fox Sports 2}}
When the network launched, Fox management, having seen the critical role that sports programming soccer events, in particular had played in the growth of the British satellite service [[BSkyB]], believed that sports – and specifically, [[American football|professional football]] would be the engine that would make Fox a major network the quickest. In 1987, after ABC initially hedged on renewing its contract to broadcast ''[[Monday Night Football]]'', Fox made an offer to the National Football League to acquire the rights for the same amount that ABC had been paying, about $13&nbsp;million per game at the time. However, partly due to the fact that Fox had not yet established itself as a major network, the NFL chose to renew its contract with ABC (where ''Monday Night Football'' remained until its move to sister cable channel [[ESPN]] in September 2006).

Six years later, when the league entered contract negotiations with its television partners, Fox placed a $1.58&nbsp;billion bid to obtain broadcast rights to the National Football Conference – covering four seasons of games, beginning with the 1994 NFL season.<ref name="FOXNFC"/> The NFL selected the Fox bid on December 18, 1993, stripping CBS of football telecasts for the first time since 1955. The event placed Fox on par with the "Big Three" television networks and ushered in an era of growth for the NFL. Fox's acquisition of the NFL rights also quickly led toward the network reaching an affiliation deal with New World Communications to change the affiliations of twelve of its stations to Fox ([[#Luring the NFL and affiliation switches|see above]]). The rights gave Fox many new viewers and a platform for advertising its other programs.

With a sports division now established with the arrival of the NFL, Fox acquired broadcast television rights to the [[National Hockey League]] (1994–99),<ref>{{cite news|title=Fox Outbids CBS for N.H.L.

From 2007 to 2010, Fox aired the [[Bowl Championship Series]]—a group of college football [[bowl game]]s held around [[New Year's Day]], and the [[BCS National Championship Game]] (with the exception of any event held at the [[Rose Bowl Stadium]], including the [[Rose Bowl Game]] and the Rose Bowl-hosted [[2010 BCS National Championship Game]], as their organizer maintained a separate contract with [[ESPN College Football on ABC|ABC]]). Following the conclusion of the deal, Fox acquired rights to the [[Big Ten Conference]] and [[Pac-12 Conference]]'s newly established football championship games (the latter alternating yearly with ESPN).<ref>{{cite news|title=Fox To Air New Big Ten Football Championship Game – Broadcaster Secures Rights To Conference's Title Tilt From 2011–16|url=http://www.multichannel.com/article/460047-Fox_To_Air_New_Big_Ten_Football_Championship_Game.php|work=Multichannel News|date=November 17, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|title=ESPN, Fox Tie Up Pac-12 Rights For $3 Billion: Reports|url=http://www.multichannel.com/article/467747-ESPN_Fox_Tie_Up_Pac_12_Rights_For_3_Billion_Reports.php|magazine=Multichannel News|accessdate=September 8, 2012}}</ref> In 2017, Fox acquired tier 1 rights to the Big Ten Conference.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.cleveland.com/osu/2017/05/ohio_state_vs_michigan_rivalry.html|title=Ohio State vs. Michigan football rivalry to be televised on FOX during 2017 season|last=Landis|first=Bill|date=15 May 2017|work=[[The Plain Dealer]]|accessdate=24 September 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://awfulannouncing.com/ncaa/know-new-big-ten-rights-deal.html|title=What we know about the new Big Ten rights deal|date=2017-07-31|work=Awful Announcing|access-date=2018-10-26|language=en-US}}</ref>

In August 2011, Fox and [[mixed martial arts]] promotion [[Ultimate Fighting Championship]] (UFC) reached a multi-year agreement, which included the rights to broadcast four live events in prime time or late night annually, marking the first time that the UFC aired its events on broadcast television. Its first [[UFC on Fox]] event, Velasquez vs. Dos Santos, aired on November 12, 2011.<ref>{{cite web|title= It's Official: UFC and Fox Are Now in Business Together|url=http://mmaweekly.com/its-official-ufc-and-fox-are-now-in-business-together|website=MMAWeekly.com|date=August 18, 2011|accessdate=August 18, 2011}}</ref> This deal ended at the end of 2018, with UFC events moving to [[ESPN]] and [[ESPN+]].

The network's telecast of [[Super Bowl XLVIII]] remains the highest rated program in the history of the network, and the second-highest-rated U.S. television program of all time.

<!--- Please update station count in the below paragraph whenever the accompanying list referenced is updated. --->
Fox has 18 owned-and-operated stations, and current and pending affiliation agreements with 226 additional television stations encompassing 50 states, the District of Columbia and three U.S. possessions;<ref name=re>{{cite web|title=Stations for Network – Fox|url=http://www.rabbitears.info/search.php?request=network_search&network=Fox|website=[[RabbitEars]]|accessdate=November 6, 2019}}</ref><ref name="StationIndex">{{cite web|title=Network Profile: Fox|url=http://www.stationindex.com/tv/by-net/fox|website=Station Index|accessdate=March 12, 2015}}</ref> through its Fox Television Stations subsidiary, Fox has the most owned-and-operated stations of the major American commercial broadcast networks. The network has a national reach of 95.77% of all households in the United States (or 299,268,292 Americans with at least one television set). Currently, [[New Jersey]] and [[Delaware]] are the only U.S. states where Fox does not have a locally licensed affiliate (the former is served by New York City O&O WNYW and Philadelphia O&O WTXF, while the latter is served by WTXF and [[Salisbury, Maryland]] affiliate [[WBOC-TV|WBOC-DT2]]).

Fox largely discontinued analog broadcasts on June 12, 2009, as part of the [[Digital television transition in the United States|transition to digital television]]. As a newer broadcast network, Fox still has a few [[Low-power broadcasting|low-power]] affiliates broadcasting in analog, covering markets like [[Youngstown, Ohio]] ([[WYFX-LD]]). In some markets, including both of the ones mentioned, these stations also maintain digital simulcasts on a [[digital subchannel|subchannel]] of a co-owned/managed television station. Fox also maintains a sizeable number of subchannel-only affiliations in cities located outside the 50 largest Nielsen-designated markets that do not have enough full-power stations to support a standalone affiliation or have a low-power station as the only other option as an affiliate; the largest subchannel-only Fox affiliate by market size is [[WGGB-TV|WGGB-DT2]] in [[Springfield, Massachusetts]].

Currently outside Fox's core [[Owned-and-operated television stations in the United States#Fox|O&O group]], [[Nexstar Media Group]] is Fox's largest affiliate group in terms of overall market reach, with fourteen stations (including some former Fox O&Os that were spun off in 2008 to [[Local TV LLC|Local TV]], which Tribune Broadcasting later acquired in 2013, to finance former Fox parent News Corporation's purchase of ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''; Nexstar purchased Tribune in the fall of 2019);<ref>{{cite web|title=Tribune of the future' takes shape|url=http://www.robertfeder.com/2013/12/28/tribune-of-the-future-takes-shape/|author=Robert Feder|website=RobertFeder.com|date=December 27, 2013|accessdate=December 29, 2013|author-link=Robert Feder}}</ref> the Sinclair Broadcast Group is the largest operator of Fox stations by numerical total, owning or providing services to 26 Fox-affiliated stations.

Fox previously distributed its programming in markets that did not have enough stations to support an affiliate via [[Foxnet]], a cable channel acting as an alternate national feed for small and certain mid-sized U.S. markets (generally those within the bottom 110 Nielsen media markets) that launched in 1991 and operated until its shutdown on September 12, 2006; the channel featured a master schedule of programs acquired from the syndication market and some [[brokered programming]] to fill time slots not occupied by Fox network programming. The concept behind Foxnet served as the basis for [[The WB 100+ Station Group]] (launched in September 1998 as the cable-only feed of The WB) and [[The CW Plus]] (the immediate successor of The WB 100+, which launched in September 2006 as a cable-only/digital multicast feed of The CW), which both allow the customization of localized branding (which Foxnet did not allow its cable partners to do) in addition to allowing affiliates to sell local advertising.

==Differences between Fox and the "Big Three" networks==

===Network programming===
Fox's programming schedule differs from the "Big Three" networks in several significant ways: the network airs its prime time programming for only two hours on Monday through Saturday evenings and three hours on Sundays, compared to the three hours on Monday through Saturdays (from 8:00 to 11:00&nbsp;p.m.) and four hours on Sunday nights (from 7:00 to 11:00&nbsp;p.m. Eastern and Pacific Time) programmed by the three longer-established networks, ABC, CBS and NBC. This scheduling is termed as "common prime", referring to the programming of prime time content across all of the conventional broadcast networks during the early- and mid-evening hours, while the 10:00&nbsp;p.m. (Eastern) hour is programmed only by the three older networks.

Fox has traditionally avoided programming the 10:00&nbsp;p.m. hour, choosing to cede the time period to its local affiliates for them to program, many of which air local newscasts during that hour; however, some exceptions do exist for select special film presentations, which by virtue of their [[Time complexity|running time]] (depending on whether the film's original length, combined with commercial breaks that would be included in the television cut, would exceed a traditional two-hour broadcast timeslot) must spill over into the 10:00&nbsp;p.m. hour, and overruns from live sports telecasts scheduled to air during prime time. However, the network did regularly schedule programming in the 10:00&nbsp;p.m. hour on Sunday nights from September 1989 to September 1993 (when that specific time period was turned back over to its affiliates),<ref>{{cite web|title=Right On Schedule: FOX Sundays (1988–1989)|url=http://thiswastv.com/2013/01/09/right-on-schedule-fox-sundays-1988-1989/|author=Anthony Strand|website=This Was TV|date=January 9, 2013|accessdate=June 26, 2015}}</ref> although it never added programming at that hour on any other night. Fox's original reason for the reduced number of prime time hours was to avoid fulfilling FCC requirements in effect at the time to be considered a network,<ref>{{cite news|title=THE MEDIA BUSINESS; No Newscast, but Plenty of Good News for Fox|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/25/business/the-media-business-no-newscast-but-plenty-of-good-news-for-fox.html|author=Elizabeth Kolbert|newspaper=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=May 25, 1994|accessdate=June 27, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=UCLA TV Violence Monitoring Project: Operating Premises and Stipulations |url=http://www.digitalcenter.org/webreport94/iie.htm |website=DigitalCenter.org |accessdate=June 17, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100716221601/http://www.digitalcenter.org/webreport94/iie.htm |archivedate=July 16, 2010 }}</ref> and to be free of resulting regulations, although these rules have since been relaxed.

Despite being a major network, in addition to not carrying national morning and evening newscasts, Fox also does not air any network [[daytime television|daytime]] programming (such as soap operas, [[game show]]s or [[talk show]]s). Because of this, the network's owned-and-operated stations and affiliates handle the responsibility of programming daytime hours with syndicated or locally produced programming (then corporate sister [[20th Television]] distributes several syndicated daytime programs carried by many Fox stations, such as ''[[Divorce Court]]'' and ''[[The Wendy Williams Show]]''; Fox Television Stations also test markets certain series from 20th Television and other syndicators such as [[Warner Bros. Television Distribution]] that are proposed for national distribution on some of its stations).<ref>{{cite web|title=Why Fox is Giving 'Kris' and 'The Real' a Summer Test Run|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/kris-jenner-talk-show-why-579904|author=Alex Ben Block|periodical=The Hollywood Reporter|publisher=Prometheus Global Media|date=July 8, 2013|accessdate=June 26, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Fox Stations Combat 'Broken' Syndication Biz with In-House Development|url=https://variety.com/2014/tv/news/fox-stations-combat-broken-syndication-biz-with-in-house-development-1201254855/|author=Cynthia Littleton|periodical=The Hollywood Reporter|publisher=Prometheus Global Media|date=June 30, 2014|accessdate=June 26, 2015}}</ref> The network also does not carry network-supplied children's programming on Saturday mornings or late-night programming on Monday through Friday nights. Local affiliates either produce their own programming or run syndicated programs during these time periods. Because of the erratic scheduling of the network's sports programming, many Fox stations choose to run a mix of syndicated programming, infomercials and especially movies to fill weekend afternoon timeslots when a sports event is not scheduled to air.

In addition, from the network's inception, Fox has produced two versions of its program promotions for distribution to the network's stations: a standard version incorporating airtimes based on their broadcast in the Eastern/Central or Pacific/Mountain time zones, depending on the feed used by the station (as those seen during network commercial breaks), and versions with "clean" end tags to allow stations to include local airtime and station information through [[local insertion|graphical insertion]] and verbal continuity by station [[continuity (broadcasting)|promotional announcers]] during the program logo graphic or prime time menu. This practice – which differs from that long used by ABC, NBC and CBS, which only allow their stations to insert logos within their network promotions – was also later adopted by The WB and UPN (and their successors The CW, and to a lesser extent, MyNetworkTV) for use by their affiliated stations. A third cut of these promos exists for national program advertising carried by cable networks (including Fox's sister cable networks), where the wording 'check local listings' is placed in the end tag.

Fox is the only broadcast network that currently carries [[adult animation|adult animated]] comedies. This started with ''[[The Simpsons]]'' and later ''[[Family Guy]]'', ''[[American Dad!]]'', ''[[King of the Hill]]'', ''[[Futurama]]'', ''[[The Cleveland Show]]'', and ''[[Bob's Burgers]]''. While ABC, CBS, and NBC have tried to copy the success of Fox with adult animated shows, none were successful.

===News programming===
Within Fox's station body, the quantity of locally produced news programming varies considerably compared to the owned-and-operated and affiliated stations of ABC, NBC, and CBS (which typically carry at least 4½ hours of local newscasts on weekdays and one hour on weekends, which are usually spread across morning, midday, early or late evening timeslots). At minimum, most Fox stations run a late-evening newscast following the network's prime time lineup (at 10:00&nbsp;p.m. in the Eastern and Pacific, and 9:00&nbsp;p.m. in the [[Central Time Zone|Central]] and [[Mountain Time Zone]]s), which typically run 30 minutes to one hour in length; besides the fact that the network's stations have more latitude to air an earlier late-evening newscast since Fox does not program that hour, this stems from the fact that several of its charter stations were already airing prime time newscasts as independent stations prior to the network's launch (such as New York City O&O WNYW, which debuted its 10:00&nbsp;p.m. newscast in March 1967). Most Fox stations also carry a weekday morning newscast of one to three hours in length at 7:00&nbsp;a.m., as a local alternative to the national morning news programs provided by the "Big Three" networks (though mainly in the case of Fox stations that have a news operation and in a few cases, via simulcasts with ABC-, NBC- and CBS-affiliated stations that operate a Fox affiliate, this is often part of a morning news block that runs for four to six hours on average).

Fox has fewer stations that have an independent news operation than those of ABC, NBC and CBS; {{as of|October 2015|lc=y}}, 70 of Fox's 236 stations (including all 18 [[Fox Television Stations|owned-and-operated stations]]) maintain in-house news departments (compared to roughly {{frac|5|8}}–{{frac|7|8}} of the stations of each of the three other major broadcast networks, whose newscasts are either produced in-house or in conjunction with another station). [[WJW (TV)|WJW]] (channel 8) in [[Cleveland]] (which was owned by the network from 1997 to 2008) and [[WXIN (TV)|WXIN]] (channel 59) in [[Indianapolis]] have the highest weekly total of news programming hours among Fox's stations, at 65½ hours.

Most Fox stations that run a news operation utilize a newscast-intensive scheduling format that is very similar to an ABC-, NBC-, or CBS-affiliated station which in many cases, may incorporate midday or early-evening newscasts, the latter of which is often extended by a half-hour to compete with the national evening newscasts provided by the "Big Three" networks; some Fox stations except for those owned by Fox Television Stations and those formerly owned by Tribune Broadcasting air their early-evening newscasts only on Monday through Friday nights, due to frequent sports event overruns into that daypart on weekends. The first Fox station to adopt such a scheduling format was WSVN in Miami; upon affiliating with the network in January 1989, WSVN retained its existing morning, midday and early evening newscasts, while moving its late newscast from 11:00&nbsp;p.m. to 10:00&nbsp;p.m. and expanding it to one hour (the station later relaunched an 11:00&nbsp;p.m. newscast in 1995), and expanding its weekday morning newscast by two hours. This type of format was later adopted by the former major network stations that switched to Fox between 1994 and 1996, especially those affected by New World and Burnham Broadcasting affiliation deals. Many Fox stations with upstart news departments often do not run a full slate of newscasts initially, usually carrying only a prime time newscast at first, before gradually adding other newscasts over time.

In many small to mid-sized markets (largely those ranked outside the 50 largest [[Nielsen Media Research|Nielsen]]-designated [[media market|television markets]]), production of the local Fox affiliate's newscasts is outsourced to an NBC, ABC, or CBS station – either due to insufficient funds or studio space for a news department or in most cases, as a byproduct of the station being operated through a legal [[duopoly (broadcasting)|duopoly]] or a [[local marketing agreement|management agreement]] with a major network affiliate (such as with [[Cunningham Broadcasting]]-owned [[WEMT]] (channel 39) in [[Greeneville, Tennessee]], which has its newscasts produced by NBC affiliate [[WCYB-TV]] (channel 5) through a local marketing agreement with Sinclair Broadcast Group). Fox affiliates that outsource their news production to a major-network affiliate often carry a lesser amount of news programming than is possible with an affiliate with a standalone news department due to the contracting station's preference to avoid having the Fox station's newscasts compete against their own in common timeslots (differing from outsourcing agreements between two same-market ABC, CBS, or NBC affiliates in certain areas, in which both stations may simulcast newscasts in the same timeslots). The lone exceptions to this rule currently are [[El Paso, Texas]] affiliate [[KFOX-TV]] (channel 14) and WXIN, which respectively began producing newscasts for their CBS-affiliated duopoly partners using resources from their existing news departments in September 2014 (when new sister stations KFOX and [[KDBC-TV]] (channel 4) consolidated their operations into a single facility) and January 2015 (when WXIN sister [[WTTV]] (channel 4) affiliated with CBS), with the Fox stations maintaining the same amount of news programming that they did beforehand.<ref>{{cite news|title=KFOX-KDBC marriage will change El Paso TV market|url=http://www.elpasotimes.com/business/ci_26620489/kfox-kdbc-marriage-will-change-el-paso-tv|author=Vic Kolenc|newspaper=[[El Paso Times]]|publisher=[[MediaNews Group]]/[[Gannett Company]]|date=September 28, 2014|accessdate=June 27, 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20141111160153/http://www.elpasotimes.com/business/ci_26620489/kfox-kdbc-marriage-will-change-el-paso-tv|archivedate=November 11, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Tribune Readies for Launch of Indianapolis CBS Affiliate|url=http://www.adweek.com/tvspy/tribune-readies-for-launch-of-indianapolis-cbs-affiliate/130874|author=Kevin Eck|website=[[AdWeek|TVSpy]]|publisher=[[Guggenheim Partners|Mediabistro Holdings]]|date=September 26, 2014|accessdate=June 27, 2015}}</ref> Another exception is [[KNPN-LD]] (channel 26) in [[St. Joseph, Missouri]], which has been the smallest Fox affiliate by market size with an in-house news operation since the station's July 2012 sign-on; [[News-Press & Gazette Company]] expanded production of KNPN's newscasts to its sister flagship stations, [[KNPG-LD]] (channel 21) and [[KCJO-LD]] (channel 30), when they respectively joined NBC and CBS in November 2016 and June 2017, though the former also maintained roughly the same amount of news programming before the conversions (KNPN airs morning, midday and early evening newscasts on weekdays and a nightly late evening newscast; all three stations simulcast the first 90 minutes of the morning newscast, while the remainder of KNPN's newscasts air in separate time slots from those seen on KNPG and KCJO).

[[WPGH-TV]] (channel 53) in [[Pittsburgh]] is the largest Fox station by Nielsen market ranking (at #23) that outsources its news programming; NBC affiliate [[WPXI]] (channel 11; owned by [[Cox Media Group]]) has produced the station's 10:00&nbsp;p.m. newscast since 2006, when WPGH shut down its news department following the closure of owner Sinclair Broadcast Group's [[News Central]] division.<ref>{{cite news|title=Fox affiliate will buy its news from WPXI, lay off 35|url=http://triblive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/news/regional/s_412726.html#ixzz3eISwS3aU|author=Michael Yeomans|newspaper=[[Pittsburgh Tribune-Review]]|publisher=Tribune-Review Publishing Company|date=January 12, 2006|accessdate=June 27, 2015}}</ref> A few Fox affiliates only air syndicated programming in time periods where newscasts would air on other major network stations. The largest Fox station by market size that does not carry news programming is [[WSYT]] (channel 68) in [[Syracuse, New York]] (which discontinued a 10:00&nbsp;p.m. newscast produced by CBS affiliate [[WTVH]] (channel 5) in 2006). In [[Dayton, Ohio]], Sinclair Broadcast Group took the unusual step in August 2015 of adopting ''Fox 45 News'' as its universal brand for its news operation in that market, making it appear as if the news department was operated by [[WRGT-TV]], even though it actually belongs to WRGT's virtual duopoly partner, ABC affiliate [[WKEF]], which Sinclair owns outright (newscasts on WKEF would be branded as "''Fox 45 News on ABC22''"); Sinclair utilized WRGT over WKEF due to the latter's perennial "also-ran" reputation in the market in regards to their newscast ratings. WRGT and WKEF have since switched to a new branding model in the summer of 2019 involving a 24/7 web news service known as "Dayton 24/7 Now".

===Video-on-demand services===
Fox maintains several [[video on demand]] venues for viewers to watch the network's programming, including a traditional VOD service called Fox on Demand, which is carried on most traditional cable, satellite, streaming, and telecom providers. Fox also streams most of its programming on the streaming video service [[Hulu]], along with traditional streaming via the network's Full Episode portal on Fox.com. The network's mobile and [[digital media player]] app is branded as FoxNow, and features access to a live stream of the network's primetime and sports programming (though not local and syndicated programming for affiliates not owned by the network), along with full-time live streams of their owned cable networks with [[TV Everywhere]] authentication through authorized television providers.

The most recent episodes of the network's shows are usually made available on the Fox on Demand television service the day after their original broadcast. In addition, [[fast forward]]ing capabilities are disabled while viewing content (a commonality for video-on-demand television services provided by the U.S. broadcast networks) and the program's original advertisements that aired during the initial broadcast are included for a week after becoming available on the service, before being replaced by [[Direct-response marketing|direct response]] advertising thereafter. Due to restrictions put in place by the network in January 2012 to encourage live or same-week [[digital video recorder|DVR]] viewing via traditional and cable on demand methods, Hulu and Fox.com both impose an eight-day delay for most viewers to access the most recent episode of any Fox program, [[TV Everywhere|restricting day-after-air streaming]] of its shows on both services to subscribers of certain pay television providers (such as [[Dish Network]] and [[Verizon FiOS]]) using an [[Internet service provider|ISP]] account through agreements made with Fox, along with Hulu's free service with advertisements on Yahoo! Stream;<ref>{{cite web|title=Fox Expands On Demand Deals: Agreements with Verizon and Mediacom will give their subscribers next day VOD and online access to Fox's prime time programming|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/technology/fox-expands-demand-deals/48772|author=George Winslow|periodical=Broadcasting & Cable|publisher=NewBay Media|date=October 25, 2011}}</ref> however, Hulu offers newer episodes of Fox programs the day after their original broadcast to paid subscribers requiring only a user-determined login.

In March 2020, Fox began to stream the full schedule of all of their owned Fox Television Stations through FoxNow.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cordcuttersnews.com/fox-makes-cable-news-free-to-stream-during-coronavirus-crisis/|title=Fox News is Now Free to Stream During Coronavirus Crisis|last=Barnes|first=Jess|date=18 March 2020|publisher=Cord Cutters News|accessdate=9 April 2020}}</ref>

===Fox HD===
[[File:FOX HD.svg|thumb|Fox HD logo used from 2004 to 2013; the final version featured the "HD" characters against the "X".|alt=|75x29px|center]]
Fox began broadcasting its programming in [[720p]] [[High-definition television|high definition]] on September 12, 2004, with that day's slate of NFC football games during week one of the [[2004 NFL season]]. Until March 14, 2016, the network did not display an [[digital on-screen graphic|on-screen logo graphic]] on the bottom-right corner of the screen, outside a ten-second sweep of a "Fox HD" promotional logo (which until the end of 2010, also featured a sponsor tag for [[DirecTV]]); instead a trigger in Fox's program delivery system at each station displayed the logo bug of an owned-and-operated or affiliate station in the right-hand corner of the 16:9 screen frame, which disappeared during commercial breaks (the station logo bug would still be triggered even if Fox programming was pre-empted locally due to breaking news, [[severe weather]] coverage or special programming, though some stations, such as [[WGGB-TV|WGGB-DT2]] in [[Springfield, Massachusetts]], did not display a logo or substitute only the "FOX" logo alone). However, network or affiliate bugs are not displayed during Fox Sports programming. During some high-profile or live programs such as ''American Idol'' and ''[[So You Think You Can Dance]]'', however, Fox forwent the affiliate's logo and displayed its network logo instead, mainly for promotional consideration due to [[fair use]] of clips from each series by other media outlets (such as news programs, talk shows, and review and satirical programs that rely on clip content); until 2014, the bug was placed in the [[4:3]] [[safe area (television)|safe area]]. The Sunday political talk program ''Fox News Sunday'' displayed the "Fox HD" logo at all times for both that reason and because of many stations airing the program on [[broadcast delay|tape delay]] later in the morning. Beginning on March 14, 2016, the standard Fox logo with [[hashtag]] is now used on all programming, with the station bug flashed for a few moments at the start of a program or coming out of commercial, as is traditionally done with ABC, CBS and NBC stations. In addition, the Fox HD bug was discontinued; although it was still used on ''Fox News Sunday'' until around late 2019-early 2020.

On some Fox programs, a hashtag rests above the affiliate's logo (for example, {{Not a typo|''[[New Girl (TV series)|#newgirl]]''}} or ''[[Bones (TV series)|#bones]]'') to provide viewers reference to the network's official [[Twitter]] search tag to find or start discussions during the program being broadcast. In April 2012, additional tags relating to plot points in a given episode (for instance, the ''[[Saturday Night Glee-ver|#saturdaynightGLEEver]]'' tag for an April 2012 episode of ''Glee'' of that same title) began to also be promoted in this space to both add additional trending topics and spread out more conversations on Twitter.<ref>{{cite web|title=Fox Launches Spoilerific Twitter Campaign For Glee, Bones, Fringe and More|url=http://tvline.com/2012/04/16/glee-bones-fringe-spoilers-twitter-fox/|author=Michael Ausiello|website=[[TVLine]]|publisher=Penske Media Corporation|date=April 16, 2012|accessdate=April 23, 2012}}</ref> In cases where the Fox bug appears instead of the station's logo bug, the Twitter hashtag is directly above the Fox logo in the safe area.

During the transitional period from analog to digital television, Fox was the only commercial television network in the U.S. to air programs in [[widescreen]] that were not available in HD (which were identified as being presented in "Fox High Resolution Widescreen" from 2001 to 2006). Prior to the launch of its HD feed, some sitcoms and drama series were presented in widescreen [[standard-definition television|standard-definition]], with reality, talk and game shows (''American Idol'' being the first major exception, as it began to be presented in high definition in 2008) later being presented only in widescreen [[enhanced-definition television|enhanced definition]]. The children's sports program ''[[This Week in Baseball]]'' began airing in widescreen in 2009, while ''Fox News Sunday'' converted to HD when Fox News Channel began operating from its new high-definition facilities in November 2008 (prior to Fox News Channel's conversion to a unified widescreen presentation on both its high-definition and standard-definition feeds in September 2010, it was the final Fox News program to structure its graphics and camera positions for the 4:3 safe area). ''MADtv'' was produced to air only in 4:3 until September 2008, likely due to a combination of stations tape-delaying the program and therefore being unable to offer it via the live network feed in 16:9, and the show's producers not making the switch to the format. The final Fox show to convert to HD was ''Family Guy'' beginning with its [[And Then There Were Fewer|September 26, 2010]], episode; all programming provided by Fox, outside of a few infomercials in the ''Weekend Marketplace'' block, is now broadcast in widescreen ''and'' in high definition {{as of|2013|lc=y}}.

Fox is unique among U.S. broadcasters as it distributes its HD feed over satellite to the network's affiliates as an [[MPEG transport stream]] intended to be delivered bit-for-bit for broadcast transmission. During network programming hours, local commercials are inserted over the feed using a transport stream splicer.<ref>{{cite web|title=Fox stations to splice HD feed at local level|url=http://www.tvtechnology.com/news/0086/fox-stations-to-splice-hd-feed-at-local-level/235265|website=Broadcast Engineering|via=TVTechnology|date=February 2, 2004|accessdate=July 17, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016073449/http://www.tvtechnology.com/news/0086/fox-stations-to-splice-hd-feed-at-local-level/235265|archive-date=October 16, 2015|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Affiliates of most other networks decode compressed satellite network video feeds and then re-encode them for final over-the-air transmission.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

After Fox began broadcasting its sports programming with graphics optimized for 16:9 displays rather than the 4:3 safe area in late July 2010, the network asked cable and satellite providers to comply and use the #10 [[Active Format Description]] flag it now disseminates over Fox programming, which displays content natively broadcast in 16:9 in a [[Letterboxing (filming)|letterbox]]ed format suitable for 4:3 television screens to allow any optimized graphical elements to be displayed in full.<ref>{{cite web|title=Fox Sports taking a wider view of football|url=http://www.jsonline.com/sports/102116644.html|author=Bob Wolfley|newspaper=[[Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel]]|publisher=[[Journal Media Group|Journal Communications]]|date=September 2, 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100905012943/http://www.jsonline.com/sports/102116644.html|archivedate=September 5, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=MilwaukeeHDTV.org Forums >> View Single Post >> MLB on FOX6|url=http://www.milwaukeehdtv.org/forums/showpost.php?p=55945&postcount=4|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720090954/http://www.milwaukeehdtv.org/forums/showpost.php?p=55945&postcount=4|url-status=dead|archive-date=July 20, 2011|website=MilwaukeeHDTV.org|date=August 1, 2010}}</ref> Subsequently, a number of Fox O&Os and affiliates also began disseminating the AFD #10 flag over local news and syndicated programs that the stations broadcast in HD, and have incorporated graphical elements seen during local programs and on-air promos (as well as logo bugs) optimized for the letter boxed presentation.

==Branding{{anchor|Slogans, logos and more}}==

===Station standardization===
During the early 1990s, Fox began having its stations use a branding structure using a combination of the "Fox" name and the station's channel number, often followed by the licensed call letters (for instance, WNYW in New York City, WTTG in Washington, D.C. and [[WAGA-TV]] in Atlanta, Georgia, are all branded as "Fox 5"). By the mid-to-late 1990s, stations minimized their call letters to be just barely readable while still in compliance with FCC identification requirements. This marked the start of the trend for other networks to apply such naming schemes.

The branding scheme has varied in some markets, with some Fox stations using a city or regional name within the branding instead of the channel number (for example, Chicago owned-and-operated station WFLD branded as "Fox Chicago" from 1997 to 2012<ref>{{cite web|title=Changing channels: Chicago TV stations face management churn, digital competition|url=http://www.chicagobusiness.com/article/20121103/ISSUE01/311039976/changing-channels-chicago-tv-stations-face-management-churn-digital-competition|author=Lynne Marek|newspaper=[[Crain's Chicago Business]]|publisher=[[Crain Communications]]|date=November 3, 2012|accessdate=May 14, 2015}}</ref> and Philadelphia O&O [[WTXF-TV]] branded as "Fox Philadelphia" from 1995 to 2003); a few of the network's stations also minimized use of the "Fox" name, opting to use their call letters or a more generic branding (WSVN in Miami, which has branded as "WSVN 7" for general use and "(Channel) 7 News" for its newscasts since it joined the network in January 1989; KHON-TV (channel 2) in [[Honolulu]], which changed its general branding from "Fox 2" to "KHON 2" in 2003; WDRB in Louisville, Kentucky, which dropped its "Fox 41" brand in favor of branding by its call letters in September 2011;<ref>{{cite news|title=WDRB Attempts to Renew Contract With Fox, Establish Own Identity|url=http://archives.wfpl.org/2011/05/20/wdrb-attempts-to-renew-contract-with-fox-establish-own-identity/|author=Gabe Bullard|website=[[WFPL]]|date=May 20, 2011|accessdate=May 14, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150723015939/http://archives.wfpl.org/2011/05/20/wdrb-attempts-to-renew-contract-with-fox-establish-own-identity/|archive-date=July 23, 2015|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> and [[KVRR]] (channel 15) in [[Fargo, North Dakota]], which dropped the generic "Fox" branding it used in part due to its network of [[Broadcast relay station#Satellite stations|repeater stations]] throughout eastern North Dakota in favor of branding by its calls in May 2015). Similarly, most of the stations that switched to Fox as a result of its 1994 affiliation deal with New World Communications retained their Big Three-era branding for general or news purposes (with a few exceptions such as [[WJW (TV)|WJW]] in Cleveland, which dropped its CBS-era "TV8" and "Newscenter 8" brands in 1995, in favor of "Fox is ei<sub>8</sub>ht" as a general brand and ''ei<sub>8</sub>ht is News'' as the title for its newscasts; likewise that same year, [[KDFW]] in Dallas/Fort Worth re-branded itself as "Fox 4 Texas" after its newscast name of "News 4 Texas" before shortening its ID to simply "Fox 4" in 1996 and changing its newscast name to "Fox 4 News", both in use since then), before conforming to Fox's station branding conventions when Fox Television Stations acquired New World in 1997.

A particularly unique situation was with [[KTVU]] (channel 2) in [[Oakland, California|Oakland]]-[[San Francisco]], which as a Fox affiliate under longtime owner [[Cox Enterprises]], retained its perennial "Channel 2" brand (with limited references as "Fox Channel 2" by the early 1990s). In 1996, the station rebranded as "KTVU Fox 2" for general purposes (adding the Fox logo on the underside of the top line of its heritage "Circle Laser 2" logo as well), while retaining "''(KTVU) Channel 2 News''" as the branding for its newscasts. Fox Television Stations (which traded WFXT in Boston and [[WHBQ-TV]] (channel 13) in [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]] station to Cox in 2014, in exchange for KTVU and sister station [[KICU-TV]]) instituted the "KTVU Fox 2" branding full-time in February 2015, retaining the "Circle Laser 2" both within the group's standardized "boxkite" logo and in an alternate version (which would become the primary logo through its de-emphasis of the O&O standardization later that year) placed next to a prominent Fox wordmark.<ref>{{cite web|title=KTVU Debuts Fox O&O Look and New Branding|url=http://damonbroadcasting.blogspot.com/2015/02/ktvu-debuts-fox-o-look-and-new-branding.html|website=TV News Coverage You Can Count On|date=February 9, 2015|accessdate=May 14, 2015}}</ref> Another situation also includes another Fox station [[KCPQ]] in [[Seattle]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], which as a Fox affiliate under [[Tribune Media]] and [[Nexstar Media Group]], also retained the "Q13 Fox" name as well as the "Q13 News" name for its newscast, even after its acquisition from Fox. It is currently the only Fox O&O that does not use Fox's standardized name for its newscasts.

Starting in 2006, more standardization of the O&Os began to take place both on-air and online. All of the network's O&Os began adopting an on-air look more closely aligned with the [[Fox News]] Channel, which included a standardized red, white and blue boxkite-style logo augmented by red pillars (which rotated on-air, particularly in the logo bugs seen during newscasts). After News Corporation's acquisition of the social networking site [[Myspace]] (which it sold in June 2011 to a consortium that included singer [[Justin Timberlake]] among its backers), some Fox O&Os launched websites with identical layouts and similar URL domains under the "MyFox" scheme (such as MyFoxDC.com for WTTG). On-air usage of the FNC-inspired logos was reduced in August 2012 (when a new standardized graphics package was implemented, with [[wordmark]] bugs being used during newscasts and other programming), while several of the O&Os ceased using the "MyFox" domains in 2015; the use of the Fox News Channel boxkite logos in all elements, along with explicit connections with the latter, was drastically reduced since the July 2016 resignation of Roger Ailes from Fox for a more traditional and simpler 'call-channel number' horizontal wordmark style which is more flexible with both traditional television and smaller mobile screens. In 2017, Fox's local newscast music composer, [[Stephen Arnold Music]], released a new news music package, "Beyond", that uses none of the Fox News Channel sonic elements associated with the previous Fox O&O music package, and it has rolled out across all Fox O&O local news operations.

As of 2017, Fox O&O's with a sister MyNetworkTV station in that market have also begun to play down that network, with many MyNetworkTV O&O's now taking on the branding of "My (Fox channel number) Plus", suggesting them as an extension of their higher-profile sister Fox station. Several of these stations now also carry extended newscasts from their sister stations during primetime, pushing MyNetworkTV's schedule to a late night offering.

===Logos===
When Fox launched on October 9, 1986 as Fox Broadcasting Company, it used a logo with three squares containing the network's initials (FBC). similar to BBC's current logo from 1997–present in the UK. Below it was a rectangle with the network's full name in the same font. This logo is mostly the same color as the [[ITV (TV channel)|ITV]]'s old logo from 1998 to 2004 in the UK, which was used during the network's first six months in existence and was primarily featured as a network identification slide at the beginning of ''The Late Show with Joan Rivers''.<ref name="Retro Fox">{{cite web|title=Retro Friday: The original Fox logo|url=https://variety.com/2010/tv/news/retro-friday-the-original-fox-logo-15867/|author=Michael Schneider|periodical=Variety|publisher=Penske Media Corporation|date=April 30, 2010|accessdate=June 27, 2015}}</ref> On April 5, 1987, when the network inaugurated its prime time programming, a more familiar logo based on 20th Century Fox's signature logo design was introduced,<ref name="Retro Fox"/> featuring just the capitalized "FOX" name alongside the familiar trademark [[searchlight]]s and double-pane platform (Fox's owned-and-operated stations used a variant for station identifications from 1987 to 1989, which incorporated both an "O" and searchlight in [[negative space]], the latter of which intersected the "X" and panes within the otherwise translucent yellow/gold logo; until as late as the mid-1990s, some Fox affiliates that did not license the regulation network logo, or which used [[computer-generated imagery|CGI]] to output their station logos with local production houses which tried to emulate the parent network's logo as close as possible, used those that imitated the 20th Century Fox-inspired design in their station logos).

In September 1993, the familiar logo was given a more "hip" makeover, with the "FOX" wordmark overhauled into its current proprietary logotype and the angle changed, removing the tilting (the 1987 logo remained in use during the 1993–94 season in print advertisements featured in ''[[TV Guide]]'' and other television listings magazines).<ref name="Retro Fox"/> Starting with the introduction of this logo, the network began displaying an [[digital on-screen graphic|on-screen bug]] within its programs on the lower right-hand corner of the screen (initially for one minute at the start of each program segment or act, eventually being displayed throughout the program outside commercial breaks, before reverting to the former display format regularly upon the 2009 digital transition). The "O" character also underwent a makeover, acquiring its trademark pillar-like [[Typeface anatomy|bowl]], which has since become a major focal point for the logo and Fox advertising in lieu of the searchlight motif.

Another revised logo was introduced for the 1995–96 television season, removing the searchlights, but retaining the two lower panes and adding a third pane atop the logotype. A variant of the original 1993 design was implemented in 1996, excluding the panes underneath the network name, but restoring the searchlights placed behind the "F" and "X" in the Fox wordmark.<ref name="Retro Fox"/>

The current version of the logo was introduced in 1999, removing the searchlights completely and switching the logo exclusively to a wordmark design.<ref name="Retro Fox"/> Despite this, the searchlight theme remains an integral part of 21st Century Fox's branding efforts; they are still incorporated into Fox News Channel's logo, and the universal station logo introduced in 2006 by Fox's owned-and-operated stations – which were retained by the seven former O&Os that Fox Television Stations sold in 2008 to Local TV and had spread to several Fox stations owned by Tribune Broadcasting (including those it acquired through the company's 2013 merger with Local TV; the logo introduced by the O&Os was modified for Tribune's Fox affiliates in 2012 to feature only one searchlight as part of the company's graphical standardizations for those stations) and certain other Fox affiliates not owned or operated by either company. The 1996–99 searchlight logo is still used within the logos of a small number of Fox affiliates; the searchlights continued to be featured in the logo of sister channel FX until a rebranding effort in 2008.

For the 2019–20 season, Fox implemented branding elements by Trollbäck + Company, which slightly tweaked the existing wordmark to make it thicker, and introduced an abstract version of the wordmark whose shapes are incorporated into advertising and on-air branding elements (including an animation of the abstract shapes morphing into the main Fox logo).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://trollback.com/projects/fox-entertainment/|title=FOX Entertainment|website=Trollbäck+Company|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-17}}</ref>

==Controversy==

===Indecency===
Controversy surrounded the network in 2002 and 2003 over profanity, expressed respectively by [[Cher]] and [[Nicole Richie]], aired live during Fox's broadcast of the [[Billboard Music Award]]s on its affiliates in the Eastern and Central Time Zones despite the use of five-second [[Broadcast delay|audio delays]]; the indecent material was edited out when the program was broadcast in other time zones from the Mountain Time Zone westward.<ref>{{cite web|title=Bleep Deprivation|url=https://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2007/03/19/8402363/index.htm|author=Roger Parloff|website=[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]|publisher=[[Time Inc.]] |via=[[CNN Money]]|date=March 19, 2007}}</ref> Both of the obscene instances were condemned by the [[Parents Television Council]],<ref>{{cite press release|title=Fox Awards Show Crosses Decency Line |url=http://www.parentstv.org/ptc/publications/release/2003/1211.asp |website=[[Parents Television Council]] |date=December 11, 2003 |accessdate=December 8, 2007 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070807011630/http://www.parentstv.org/ptc/publications/release/2003/1211.asp |archivedate=August 7, 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Fast-Flying F-Words |url=http://www.parentstv.org/PTC/publications/lbbcolumns/2003/1219.asp |author=L.
