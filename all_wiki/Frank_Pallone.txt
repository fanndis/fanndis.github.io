==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Elections===
;1988–1990
In March 1988, 60-year-old incumbent U.S. Congressman [[James J. Howard|James Howard]] (D-Spring Lake Heights) of [[New Jersey's 3rd congressional district]] died in office. In November, the regular election coincided with a special election to complete Howard's term; Pallone won both, defeating Republican former [[New Jersey State Assembly|state Assemblyman]] [[Joseph Azzolina|Joe Azzolina]] 52%-47% and Libertarian Laura Stewart. In 1990, he won re-election with 49% of the vote, against a Republican, an independent, Libertarian Bill Stewart, and a Populist.

;1992–2008
After redistricting, Pallone's district was renumbered as the [[New Jersey's 6th congressional district|6th district]]. In the Democratic primary of 1992, he defeated State Representative [[Robert G. Smith (politician)|Robert Smith]] 55%-37%. In the general election, he defeated Republican State Senator [[Joseph Kyrillos, Jr.|Joe Kyrillos]] 52%-45% and nine other candidates. Since then, he has won re-election with at least 60% in all but two elections (1998 and 2010). In 1998, he defeated Republican teacher [[Mike Ferguson (New Jersey politician)|Mike Ferguson]] 57%-40%.

;2010

Pallone was challenged by Republican nominee Anna C. Little. Little is a former Monmouth County Freeholder and served as Mayor of [[Highlands, New Jersey]] in addition to working full-time as an attorney specializing in immigration law. On November 3, 2010, Pallone defeated Little by over 16,000 votes, 55% to 43% in what analysts considered a terrible year for Democrats. However, for the first time in his career, Pallone failed to carry his home county of Monmouth.

===Tenure===
Pallone is a Progressive Caucus Member. He serves as Vice Chairman of the Native American Caucus, where he has worked on a bipartisan basis to protect the inherent sovereignty of tribal governments and promote the needs of Indian Country.

He also serves as a co-chairman of the Congressional Caucus on Armenian Issues along with Congressman [[Ed Royce]] (previously [[Joe Knollenberg]] and [[Mark Kirk]]) and was instrumental in garnering the support of 127 members (30%) of the U.S. House of Representatives for the Armenian Caucus.<ref>{{cite web|last=Avakian |first=Florence |url=http://www.armeniafundusa.org/news/20031114-gala-success.htm |title=Karabakh president Ghoukassian starts US tour with successful tribute gala in New York |publisher=Armenia Fund USA |date=November 14, 2003 |accessdate=February 21, 2012}}</ref> In 2002 he was awarded the Mkhitar Gosh Medal by the [[President of Armenia]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.armeniaemb.org/DiplomaticMission/Ambassador/RemarksandStatements/Remarks/HonoringPallone.htm |title=Remarks by Ambassador Arman Kirakossian at the Ceremony honoring Representative Frank Pallone, Co-Chair of the Congressional Caucus on Armenian Issues |publisher=Embassy of the Republic of Armenia in the USA |date=June 12, 2002 |accessdate=February 21, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207193233/http://www.armeniaemb.org/DiplomaticMission/Ambassador/RemarksandStatements/Remarks/HonoringPallone.htm |archivedate=February 7, 2012 }}</ref>

In 2014, Pallone defeated fellow Rep. [[Anna Eshoo]] 100 to 90 in a secret-ballot vote to becoming the ranking member of the [[United States House Committee on Energy and Commerce|Committee on Energy and Commerce]]. Pallone had been the third-ranking Democrat, and was in line to becoming ranking member after the 2014 midterm elections due to the retirements of [[John Dingell]] and [[Henry Waxman]].  Pallone was backed by Minority Whip [[Steny Hoyer]] and the [[Congressional Black Caucus]], the latter which "made a repeated point to stress the importance of Pallone’s seniority. Black lawmakers have a deep appreciation for seniority, as it was historically the quickest way African-American members earned gavels". House Minority Leader [[Nancy Pelosi]] had aggressively campaigned on Eshoo's behalf, while the Steering Committee which was packed with Pelosi allies had recommended Eshoo for the ranking slot by 30 to 19 votes.<ref>https://www.politico.com/story/2014/11/frank-pallone-energy-commerce-committee-113024</ref>

After U.S. Rep. [[Chris Smith (New Jersey politician)|Chris Smith]] stated he does "not construe homosexual rights as human rights", Pallone issued a statement supporting homosexual rights.

===Legislation===
Pallone opposed the [[Gabriella Miller Kids First Research Act (H.R. 2019; 113th Congress)]], which passed in both the House and the Senate.

==Other political offices==
In 2002, Pallone turned down an offer to replace embattled Sen. [[Bob Torricelli]] as the Democratic nominee for US Senate by Democratic Party leaders. The slot eventually went to Sen. [[Frank Lautenberg]] who ended up winning the general election. In 2004-2005, Pallone considered a gubernatorial bid against embattled and unpopular Gov. [[Jim McGreevey]] but ended up supporting eventual party nominee winner, then-Senator [[Jon Corzine]].

Early in 2005, Pallone announced his intentions to seek the [[United States Senate]] position held at the time by [[Jon Corzine]]. Corzine won the Democratic nomination for [[Governor of New Jersey]] in June 2005, and Pallone was the first New Jersey politician to officially seek Corzine's Senate seat. Pallone launched "[http://www.pallonefornewjersey.com/ Pallone for New Jersey]" to inform New Jersey citizens of his work in the House and his desire to be New Jersey's next Senator. In January 2006, Pallone announced his endorsement of [[Bob Menendez]] for Senate in the November 2006 election, ending his bid for the seat.

Pallone was an early and strong endorser of Sen. [[Hillary Clinton]] in the 2008 Democratic Party primaries. Pallone traveled to [[New Hampshire]] to campaign for Clinton. Clinton eventually lost the primary to Sen. [[Barack Obama]] who went on to become President. Pallone also endorsed [[Frank Lautenberg]] over Congressman [[Rob Andrews]].
