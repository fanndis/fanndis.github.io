'''Personal genomics''' or '''consumer genetics''' is the [[branch]] of [[genomics]] concerned with the [[sequencing]], [[bioinformatics|analysis]] and interpretation of the [[Human genome|genome]] of an individual. The [[genotype|genotyping]] stage employs different techniques, including [[single-nucleotide polymorphism]] (SNP) analysis chips (typically 0.02% of the genome), or [[whole exome sequencing|partial]] or [[full genome sequencing]]. Once the genotypes are known, the individual's variations can be compared with the published literature to determine likelihood of trait expression, ancestry inference and disease risk.

Automated high-throughput sequencers have increased the speed and reduced the cost of sequencing, making it possible to offer whole genome sequencing including interpretation to consumers since 2015 for less than [[$1,000 genome|$1,000]]. The emerging market of direct-to-consumer genome sequencing services has brought new questions about both the medical efficacy and the ethical dilemmas associated with widespread knowledge of individual genetic information.

== In personalized medicine ==
[[Personalized medicine]] is a medical method that targets treatment structures and medicinal decisions based on a patient's predicted response or risk of disease.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms?cdrid=561717|title=NCI Dictionary of Cancer Terms|website=National Cancer Institute|access-date=5 December 2016|date=2011-02-02}}</ref> The [[National Cancer Institute]] or NCI, an arm of the [[National Institutes of Health]], lists a patient's genes, proteins, and environment as the primary factors analyzed to prevent, diagnose, and treat disease through personalized medicine.<ref name=":0" />

There are various subcategories of the concept of personalized medicine such as [[predictive medicine]], [[precision medicine]] and stratified medicine. Although these terms are used interchangeably to describe this practice, each carries individual nuances. ''Predictive medicine'' describes the field of medicine that utilizes information, often obtained through personal genomics techniques, to both predict the possibility of disease, and institute preventative measures for a particular individual.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nature.com/subjects/predictive-medicine|title=Predictive medicine - Latest research and news {{!}} Nature|website=www.nature.com|access-date=5 December 2016}}</ref> ''Precision medicine'' is a term very similar to personalized medicine in that it focuses on a patient's genes, environment, and lifestyle; however, it is utilized by National Research Council to avoid any confusion or misinterpretations associated with the broader term. Stratified medicine is a version of personalized medicine which focuses on dividing patients into subgroups based on specific responses to treatment, and identifying effective treatments for the particular group.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mrc.ac.uk/research/initiatives/stratified-medicine/|title=Stratified medicine|last=MRC|first=Medical Research Council|date=2016-03-03|website=www.mrc.ac.uk|access-date=5 December 2016}}</ref>

Examples of the use of personalized medicine include [[oncogenomics]] and [[pharmacogenomics]]. Oncogenomics is a field of study focused on the characterization of cancer–related genes. With cancer, specific information about a tumor is used to help create a personalized diagnosis and treatment plan.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Strausberg|first1=Robert L.|last2=Simpson|first2=Andrew J.

Overall, researchers believe pharmacogenomics will allow physicians to better tailor medicine to the needs of the individual patient.<ref name="Reference"/> As of November 2016, the FDA has approved 204 drugs with pharmacogenetics information in its labeling.

Disease risk may be calculated based on genetic markers and [[genome-wide association studies]] for common medical conditions, which are [[multifactorial inheritance|multifactorial]] and include environmental components in the assessment. Diseases which are individually [[rare disease|rare]] (less than 200,000 people affected in the USA) are nevertheless collectively common (affecting roughly 8-10% of the US population<ref>{{cite web | url=http://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/AboutUs.aspx |title=NIH Office of Rare Disease Research}}</ref>).  Over 2500 of these diseases (including a few more common ones) have predictive genetics of sufficiently high clinical impact that they are recommended as medical genetic tests available for single genes (and in whole genome sequencing) and growing at about 200 new genetic diseases per year.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/GeneTests/static/whatsnew/labdirgrowth.shtml | title=Gene Tests}}</ref>

== Cost of sequencing an individual's genome ==

The cost of sequencing a human genome is dropping rapidly, due to the continual development of new, faster, cheaper DNA sequencing technologies such as "[[DNA sequencing#New sequencing methods|next-generation DNA sequencing]]".

The National Human Genome Research Institute, an arm of the [[National Institutes of Health|U.S. National Institutes of Health]], has reported that the cost to sequence a whole human-sized genome has dropped from about $14 million in 2006 to below $1,500 by late 2015.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.genome.gov/27565109/the-cost-of-sequencing-a-human-genome/|title=The Cost of Sequencing a Human Genome|website=National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI)|access-date=5 December 2016}}</ref>

== Ethical issues ==
[[Genetic discrimination]] is discriminating on the basis of information obtained from an individual's genome. Genetic non-discrimination laws have been enacted in some US states<ref>{{cite web | title= Genetics and Health Insurance State Anti-Discrimination Laws | url=http://www.ncsl.org/issues-research/health/genetic-nondiscrimination-in-health-insurance-laws.aspx}}</ref> and at the federal level, by the [[Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act]] (GINA). The GINA legislation prevents discrimination by health insurers and employers, but does not apply to life insurance or long-term care insurance. The passage of the Affordable Care Act in 2010 strengthened the GINA protections by prohibiting health insurance companies from denying coverage because of patient's "pre-existing conditions" and removing insurance issuers ability to adjust premium costs based on certain factors such as genetic diseases.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.genome.gov/10002077/genetic-discrimination/|title=Genetic Discrimination|website=National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI)|access-date=5 December 2016}}</ref> Given the ethical concerns about pre-symptomatic genetic testing of minors,<ref>{{cite journal |author=McCabe LL|author2=McCabe ER |title=Postgenomic medicine.

There are also concerns regarding human genome research in developing countries. The tools for conducting whole genome analyses are generally found in high-income nations, necessitating partnerships between developed and developing countries in order to study the patients afflicted with certain diseases. The relevant tools for sharing access to the collected data are not equally accessible across low-income nations and without an established standard for this type of research, concerns over fairness to local researchers remain unsettled.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=de Vries|first1=Jantina|last2=Bull|first2=Susan J|last3=Doumbo|first3=Ogobara|last4=Ibrahim|first4=Muntaser|last5=Mercereau-Puijalon|first5=Odile|last6=Kwiatkowski|first6=Dominic|last7=Parker|first7=Michael|date=18 March 2011|title=Ethical issues in human genomics research in developing countries|journal=BMC Medical Ethics|volume=12|pages=5|doi=10.1186/1472-6939-12-5|pmc=3076260|pmid=21418562}}</ref>

==Other issues==

=== Genetic privacy ===
{{Main|Genetic privacy}}
In the United States, biomedical research containing human subjects is governed by a baseline standard of ethics known as [[Common Rule|The Common Rule]], which aims to protect a subject's privacy by requiring "identifiers" such as name or address to be removed from collected data.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=http://bioethics.gov/node/764|title=Privacy and Progress in Whole Genome Sequencing|publisher=Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues|access-date=30 November 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161122235132/http://bioethics.gov/node/764|archive-date=22 November 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> A 2012 report by the Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues stated, however, that "what constitutes 'identifiable' and 'de-identified' data is fluid and that evolving technologies and the increasing accessibility of data could allow de-identified data to become re-identified."<ref name=":1" /> In fact, research has already shown that it is "possible to discover a study participant's identity by cross-referencing research data about him and his DNA sequence … [with] genetic genealogy and public-records databases."<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Check Hayden|first=Erika|title=Privacy loophole found in genetic databases|url=http://www.nature.com/news/privacy-loophole-found-in-genetic-databases-1.12237|journal=Nature|doi=10.1038/nature.2013.12237|year=2013|s2cid=211729032}}</ref> This has led to calls for policy-makers to establish consistent guidelines and best practices for the accessibility and usage of individual genomic data collected by researchers.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Gutmann|first1=Amy|last2=Wagner|first2=James W.|date=2013-05-01|title=Found Your DNA on the Web: Reconciling Privacy and Progress|journal=Hastings Center Report|volume=43|issue=3|pages=15–18|doi=10.1002/hast.162|pmid=23650063}}</ref>

There is also controversy regarding the concerns with companies testing individual DNA. There are issues such as "leaking" information, the right to privacy and what responsibility the company has to ensure this does not happen. Regulation rules are not clearly laid out. What is still not determined is who legally owns the genome information: the company or the individual whose genome has been read. There have been published examples of personal genome information being exploited.<ref name=":2">{{Cite arxiv|last=De Cristofaro|first=Emiliano|date=2012-10-17|title=Whole Genome Sequencing: Innovation Dream or Privacy Nightmare? |eprint=1210.4820|class=cs.CR}}</ref> Additional privacy concerns, related to, e.g., [[genetic discrimination]], loss of anonymity, and psychological impacts, have been increasingly pointed out by the academic community<ref name=":2" /> as well as government agencies.<ref name=":1" />

=== Personalized genome utility ===
Full genome sequencing holds large promise in the world of healthcare in the potential of precise and personalized medical treatments. This use of genetic information to select appropriate drugs is known as pharmacogenomics. This technology may allow treatments to be catered to the individual and the certain genetic predispositions they may have (such as personalized chemotherapy).  Among the most impactful and actionable uses of personal genome information is the avoidance of hundreds of severe single-gene [[genetic disorders]] which endanger about 5% of newborns (with costs up to 20 million dollars),<ref>{{cite news | title=Genome sequencing: A costly way to save | author=Randy Shore | journal=Vancouver Sun  | date = 4 May 2014 | url=http://www.vancouversun.com/health/Genome+sequencing+costly+save/9802624/story.html}}</ref> for example elimination of [[Tay Sachs Disease]] via [[Dor Yeshorim]]. Another set of 59 genes vetted by the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG-59) are considered actionable in adults.<ref>{{cite news | journal=GenomeWeb | url=https://www.genomeweb.com/molecular-diagnostics/acmg-updates-secondary-findings-gene-list#.XPCS5tNKjMI | title=ACMG Updates Secondary Findings Gene List | date=17 November 2016}}</ref>

At the same time, full sequencing of the genome can identify [[Polymorphism (biology)|polymorphisms]] that are so rare and/or mild sequence change that conclusions about their impact are challenging, reinforcing the need to focus on the reliable and actionable alleles in the context of clinical care. Czech medical geneticist Eva Machácková writes: "In some cases it is difficult to distinguish if the detected sequence variant is a causal mutation or a neutral (polymorphic) variation without any effect on phenotype. The interpretation of rare sequence [[variants of unknown significance]] detected in disease-causing genes becomes an increasingly important problem."<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Machácková|first=E.|date=2003-03-01|title=Disease-causing mutations versus neutral polymorphism: use of bioinformatics and DNA diagnosis|journal=Casopis Lekaru Ceskych|volume=142|issue=3|pages=150–153|pmid=12756842}}</ref> In fact, researchers from the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC) project estimated the average person to carry 54 genetic mutations that previously were assumed pathogenic, i.e. having 100% penetrance, but without any apparent negative health presentation.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Check Hayden|first=Erika|title=Rethink the links between genes and disease: The ExAC database has shown that many mutations thought to be harmful are benign.|journal=Nature|volume=538|issue=7624|pages=140|doi=10.1038/538140a|pmid=27734882|year=2016|doi-access=free}}</ref>

As with other new technologies, doctors can order genomic tests for which some are not correctly trained to interpret the results. Many are unaware of how SNPs respond to one another. This results in presenting the client with potentially misleading and worrisome results which could strain the already overloaded health care system. In theory, this might antagonize an individual to make uneducated decisions such as unhealthy lifestyle choices and family planning modifications. Negative results which may potentially be inaccurate, theoretically decrease the quality of life and mental health of the individual (such as increased depression and extensive anxiety).

=== Direct-to-consumer genetics ===

There are also three potential problems associated with the validity of personal genome kits. The first issue is the test's validity. Handling errors of the sample increases the likelihood for errors which could affect the test results and interpretation. The second affects the clinical validity, which could affect the test's ability to detect or predict associated disorders. The third problem is the clinical utility of personal genome kits and associated risks, and the benefits of introducing them into clinical practices.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Hunter|first1=David J.|last2=Khoury|first2=Muin J.|last3=Drazen|first3=Jeffrey M.|date=2008-01-10|title=Letting the Genome out of the Bottle – Will We Get Our Wish?|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|volume=358|issue=2|pages=105–107|doi=10.1056/NEJMp0708162|pmid=18184955}}</ref>
