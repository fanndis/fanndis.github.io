The '''Mercedes-Benz Superdome''', often referred to simply as the '''Superdome''', is a domed sports and exhibition [[stadium]] located in the [[New Orleans Central Business District|Central Business District]] of [[New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]], [[United States]]. It primarily serves as the home venue for the [[New Orleans Saints]] of the [[National Football League]] (NFL), the home stadium for the [[Sugar Bowl]], [[New Orleans Bowl]] in [[college football]], and the longtime rivalry football game of the SWAC Conference's [[Southern University]] and [[Grambling State University]], known as the [[Bayou Classic]] (held yearly, every Thanksgiving Weekend). It also houses their schools’ Battle of the Bands between The Southern University "The Human Jukebox" and Grambling State's Tiger Marching Band.

Plans were drawn up in 1967 by the New Orleans modernist architectural firm of [[Curtis and Davis Architects and Engineers|Curtis and Davis]] and the building opened as the '''Louisiana Superdome''' in 1975. Its steel frame covers a {{Convert|13|acre|adj=on}} expanse and the {{Convert|273|ft|m|adj=on}} dome is made of a lamellar multi-ringed frame and has a diameter of {{Convert|680|ft|m|0}}, making it the largest fixed domed structure in the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://superdome.s3.amazonaws.com/doc/presskit.pdf|title=MERCEDES-BENZ SUPERDOME FACTS & FIGURES<!-- Bot generated title -->|publisher=}}</ref> It is adjacent to the [[Smoothie King Center]].

Because of the building's size and location in one of the major tourist destinations of the United States, the Superdome routinely hosts major sporting events, including the [[Super Bowl]], [[College Football Championship Game]], and the [[NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Championship|Final Four]] in college basketball. The stadium was also the long-time home of the [[Tulane Green Wave football]] team of [[Tulane University]] until 2014 (when they returned on-campus at [[Yulman Stadium]]) and was the home venue of the [[New Orleans Jazz (NBA team)|New Orleans Jazz]] of the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA) from 1975 until 1979.

The Superdome gained international attention of a different type in 2005 when it housed thousands of people seeking shelter from [[Hurricane Katrina]].  The building suffered extensive damage as a result of the storm, and was closed for many months afterward. It was eventually decided the building would be fully refurbished and reopened in time for the Saints' 2006 home opener on September 25.

On October 3, 2011, it was announced that German automaker [[Mercedes-Benz]] purchased naming rights to the stadium. The new name took effect on October 23, 2011.<ref name=USA_Today_naming_rights>{{cite news|last=Woodyard|first=Chris|title=Mercedes-Benz buys naming rights to New Orleans' Superdome|url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/driveon/post/2011/10/mercedes-benz-new-orleans-superdome-naming-rights-saints-bcs-super-bowl-2013/1|work=USA Today|accessdate=October 4, 2011|date=October 4, 2011}}</ref> On May 19, 2020, it was announced that Mercedes-Benz would not be renewing the naming rights agreement after the current contract expires in July 2021.<ref name=Nola.com_naming_rights>{{cite news|last=Adelson|first=Jeff|title= Mercedes-Benz declines to renew Superdome rights, opening door to new name next year|url=https://www.nola.com/news/business/article_91162752-9a1c-11ea-9138-830678a86caf.html|work=Nola.com|accessdate=September 2, 2020|date=May 19, 2020}}</ref>

==Description==
The Superdome is located on {{Convert|70
|acre}} of land, including the former [[Girod Street Cemetery]]. The dome has an interior space of {{Convert|125|e6cuft|m3|-5}}, a height of {{Convert|253|ft|m|1}}, a dome diameter of {{Convert|680|ft|m|1}}, and a total floor area of {{Convert|269000|sqft|m2|0}}.

===Capacity===
The Superdome has a listed football [[seating capacity]] of 76,468 (expanded) or 73,208 (not expanded) and a maximum basketball seating capacity of 73,432. However, published attendance figures from events such as the Super Bowl football game have exceeded 79,000. The basketball capacity does not reflect the NCAA's new policy on arranging the basketball court on the 50-yard line on the football field, per 2009 NCAA policy.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.ncaa.org/wps/wcm/connect/public/ncaa/resources/basketball+resources/seating+configuration+at+the+final+four|work=NCAA|title=Basketball Resources|date=January 2, 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131225181259/http://www.ncaa.org/wps/wcm/connect/public/NCAA/Resources/Basketball+Resources/Seating+Configuration+at+the+Final+Four|archivedate=December 25, 2013}}</ref> In 2011, 3,500 seats were added, increasing the Superdome's capacity to 76,468. The Superdome's capacity was 78,133 for [[WWE]] [[WrestleMania 34]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nola.com/festivals/index.ssf/2014/04/wrestlemania_xxx_live_blogging.html|title=WrestleMania XXX: Daniel Bryan wins WWE world heavyweight title|publisher=NOLA Media Group|accessdate=January 22, 2017}}</ref> The actual capacity is 73,208 people.

The NFL has hosted seven [[Super Bowl]]s at the Superdome, most recently [[Super Bowl XLVII]] in 2013. The Superdome is scheduled to host its eighth Super Bowl in 2025.

The [[1976 Pro Bowl]] was held at the Superdome on Monday, January 26, 1976. It was the NFL's 26th annual all-star game.<ref name=GameBook>{{cite web|title=1976 Pro Bowl game book |url=http://www.nflgsis.com/1975/Post/04/55145/Gamebook.pdf |work=NFL Game Statistics & Information |publisher=[[National Football League]] |access-date=January 30, 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/655Hy2grR?url=http://www.nflgsis.com/1975/Post/04/55145/Gamebook.pdf |archivedate=January 30, 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref>

The [[BCS National Championship Game]] was played at the Superdome four times. The [[College Football Playoff]] semifinal game is played every three years in the stadium. Two other bowl games are also played there annually: the [[Sugar Bowl]] and [[New Orleans Bowl]]. The Superdome also hosts the [[Bayou Classic]], a [[List of black college football classics|major regular-season game]] between two of the state's [[historically black colleges and universities]], [[Grambling State Tigers football|Grambling State]] and [[Southern Jaguars football|Southern]].

In 2013, the [[Arena Football League]] [[New Orleans VooDoo]] played their last six home games of the season at the stadium. From 1991 to 1992, the [[New Orleans Night]] of the [[Arena Football League|AFL]] played at the stadium.

The annual Louisiana Prep Classic state championship football games organized by the [[Louisiana High School Athletic Association]] have been held at the Superdome since 1981, except in 2005 following the extreme damage of Hurricane Katrina. The first state championship game in the stadium matched [[New Orleans Catholic League]] powers [[St. Augustine High School (New Orleans)|St. Augustine]] and [[Jesuit High School (New Orleans)|Jesuit]] on December 15, 1978. The Purple Knights won their second Class AAAA title in four seasons by ousting the Blue Jays, 13–7, in front of over 42,000 fans.

====Home field advantage====
Since the Superdome's reopening in the wake of Hurricane Katrina and the increased success of the New Orleans Saints, the Superdome has developed a reputation for having a very strong home field advantage. While all domed stadiums possess this quality to some degree, the Superdome is known to be extremely loud during games, especially during offensive drives by the visiting team.

During a pregame interview before the Minnesota Vikings' opening game of the 2010 NFL season against the Saints, [[Brett Favre]], reflecting on the Vikings' loss to the Saints in the 2009–10 NFC Championship Game, said of the Superdome: "That was, by far, the most hostile environment I've ever been in.  You couldn't hear anything." It was during that loss that some of the Vikings players elected to wear earplugs, including Favre.

When the plaza level seats remained moveable, the capacity for baseball was 63,525 and the field size was as follows: {{convert|325|ft}} to both left field and right field, {{convert|365|ft}} to both left-center field and right-center field, {{convert|421|ft}} to center field, and {{convert|60|ft}} to the backstop. The bowl was reconfigured in a renovation from 2006–2011, which replaced the moveable seats with a pre-cast concrete deck and moved the seating closer to the field, creating 3,500 new seats in the lower bowl. This made the bowl more suitable for football, but less accommodating for baseball.<ref>{{cite news|title=Final phase of Superdome facelift is under way|url=https://www.nola.com/saints/index.ssf/2011/01/final_phase_of_superdome_facel.html|date=January 22, 2011|accessdate=January 1, 2019}}</ref>

==Stadium history==
===Planning===
Sports visionary [[David Dixon (businessman)|David Dixon]] (who decades later founded the [[United States Football League]]) conceived of the Superdome while attempting to convince the NFL to award a franchise to New Orleans. After hosting several exhibition games at [[Tulane Stadium]] during typical New Orleans summer thunderstorms, Dixon was told by NFL Commissioner Pete Rozelle that the NFL would never expand into New Orleans without a domed stadium. Dixon then won the support of the [[list of Governors of Louisiana|governor]] of [[Louisiana]], [[John McKeithen]]. When they toured the [[Astrodome]] in [[Houston]], [[Texas]] in 1966, McKeithen was quoted as saying, "I want one of these, only bigger", in reference to the Astrodome itself. Bonds were passed for construction of the Superdome on November 8, 1966, seven days after commissioner [[Pete Rozelle]] awarded New Orleans the 25th professional football franchise. The stadium was conceptualized to be a multifunctional stadium for football, baseball and basketball—with moveable field level stands that would be arranged specifically for each sport and areas with dirt (for the bases and pitchers mound) covered with metal plates on the stadium floor (they were covered by the artificial turf during football games)—and there are also Meeting Rooms that could be rented for many different purposes. Dixon imagined the possibilities of staging simultaneous high school football games side by side and suggested that the synthetic surface be white.<ref>{{cite news |title=Louisiana Plans Functional Stadium|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=June 11, 1967|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1967/06/11/archives/louisiana-plans-functional-stadium.html|page=215}}</ref> Blount International of [[Montgomery, Alabama]] was chosen to build the stadium.<ref name="Air University">{{cite web |url=http://www.au.af.mil/au/goe/eagle_bios/2001/blount_2001.asp|title=Air University: Eagle Biography: Winton M. "Red" Blount|publisher=Au.af.mil|accessdate=December 14, 2011}}</ref>

As the dome was being constructed, various individuals developed eccentric models of the structure: one was of sugar, another consisted of pennies. The so-called "penny model" traveled to the Philadelphia Bicentennial '76 exhibition. New Orleanian Norman J. Kientz built the model with 2,697 pennies and donated it to the Superdome Board of Commissioners in April 1974.<ref>''Louisiana Superdome Newsletter'' 5:7 (August 1976) and III:4 (April 15, 1974).</ref>

It was hoped the stadium would be ready in time for the [[1972 NFL season]], and the final cost of the facility would come in at $46&nbsp;million. Instead, due to political delays, construction did not start until August 11, 1971, and was not finished until August 1975, seven months after [[Super Bowl IX]] was scheduled to be played in the stadium. Since the stadium was not finished in time for the Super Bowl, the game had to be moved to [[Tulane Stadium]], and was played in cold and rainy conditions. Factoring in inflation, construction delays, and the increase in transportation costs caused by the [[1973 oil crisis]], the final price tag of the stadium skyrocketed to $165&nbsp;million. Along with the [[Louisiana State Police|state police]], [[Elward Thomas Brady, Jr.]], a [[Louisiana House of Representatives|state representative]] from [[Terrebonne Parish, Louisiana|Terrebonne Parish]] and a New Orleans native, conducted an investigation into possible financial irregularities, but the Superdome went forward despite the obstacles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.houmatoday.com/article/20070408/NEWS/704080322?p=3&tc=pg|title=Robert Morris, "Local businessman, former legislator dies", April 8, 2007|publisher=houmatoday.com|accessdate=July 14, 2013}}</ref>

===Early history (1975–2003)===
The [[New Orleans Saints]] opened the [[1975 NFL season]] at the Superdome, losing 21–0 to the [[Cincinnati Bengals]] in the first regular-season game in the facility. [[Tulane Stadium]], the original home of the Saints, was condemned for destruction on the day the Superdome opened.

The first Super Bowl played in the stadium was [[Super Bowl XII]] in January [[1977 NFL season|1978]], the first in [[prime time]].

The original artificial turf playing surface in the Superdome was produced and developed by Monsanto (which made the first artificial playing surface for sports, AstroTurf) specifically for the Superdome, and was named "Mardi Grass".<ref name="ballparks1"/>

[[File:Superdome during National Lutheran Youth Gathering.jpeg|thumb|150px|right|The exterior of the Superdome during the 2001 [[Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod#LCMS National Youth Gathering|National Lutheran Youth Gathering]]]]

The Superdome replaced the first generation "Mardi Grass" surface to the next-generation FieldTurf surface midway through the [[2003 NFL season|2003]] football season on November 16.

=== Shelter of last resort during Hurricane Katrina ===
{{Main|Effect of Hurricane Katrina on the Louisiana Superdome}}
The Superdome was used as a "shelter of last resort" for those in New Orleans unable to evacuate from [[Hurricane Katrina]] when it struck on August 29, 2005. During the storm, a large section of the outer covering was peeled off by high winds. The photos of the damage, in which the concrete underneath was exposed, quickly became an iconic image of Hurricane Katrina. A few days later, the dome was closed until September 25, 2006.

By August 31, there had been three deaths in the Superdome: two elderly medical patients and a man who is believed to have committed suicide by jumping from the upper-level seats. There were also unconfirmed reports of rape, vandalism, violent assaults, crack dealing/drug abuse, and gang activity inside the Superdome. After a National Guardsman was attacked and shot in the dark by an assailant, the National Guard inside the Superdome used barbed wire barricades to separate themselves from the other people in the dome.<ref>{{cite news|last=Scott|first=Nate|title=Refuge of last resort: Five days inside the Superdome for Hurricane Katrina|url=http://ftw.usatoday.com/2015/08/refuge-of-last-resort-five-days-inside-the-superdome-for-hurricane-katrina|newspaper=[[USA Today]]|date=August 24, 2015|accessdate=June 4, 2018}} {{verify source |date=August 2019 |reason=This ref was deleted ([[Special:Diff/908821850]]) by a bug in VisualEditor and later restored by a bot from the original cite at [[Special:Permalink/899090094]] cite #5 - please verify the cite's accuracy and remove this {verify source} template.

[[File:Louisiana Superdome damage repair.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Contractors repair the roof to prepare for the reopening of the Superdome. (July 10, 2006)]]

The Superdome cost $185&nbsp;million to repair and refurbish. To repair the Superdome, [[Federal Emergency Management Agency|FEMA]] put up $115&nbsp;million,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/story/9673908/1|title=Superdome returns with glitz, glamor and Monday night football|date=September 20, 2006|work=CBS Sports|accessdate=August 6, 2009}}</ref> the state spent $13&nbsp;million, the Louisiana Stadium & Exposition District refinanced a bond package to secure $41&nbsp;million and the NFL contributed $15&nbsp;million.

After being damaged from the flooding disaster, a new Sportexe MomentumTurf surface was installed for the [[2006 NFL season|2006]] season.

On [[Super Bowl XL]] on February 5, 2006, the [[National Football League|NFL]] announced that the Saints would play their home opener on September 24, [[2006 NFL season|2006]] in the Superdome against the [[Atlanta Falcons]]. The game was later moved to September 25.

The reopening of the dome was celebrated with festivities including a free outdoor concert by the [[Goo Goo Dolls]] before fans were allowed in, a pre-game performance by [[U2]] and [[Green Day]] performing a [[cover version|cover]] of [[the Skids]]' "[[The Saints Are Coming]]", and a coin toss conducted by then-President [[George W. Bush]]. In front of [[ESPN]]'s largest-ever audience at that time, the Saints won the game 23–3 with 70,003 in attendance, and went on to a successful season, reaching their first ever [[NFC Championship Game]].

The first bowl game played in the Superdome after Katrina was the [[2006 New Orleans Bowl|New Orleans Bowl]] won by the [[Troy Trojans football|Troy Trojans]] 41–17 over the [[2006 Rice Owls football team|Rice Owls]].

====Further renovations====
[[File:Superdome Renovations.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Construction workers replace the Superdome's 30 plus year-old siding]]
[[File:Mercedes-Benz Superdome Poydras bike.JPG|right|thumb|The inscription "Mercedes-Benz Superdome" went on to the sides of the stadium in late October 2011]]
In 2008, new windows were installed to bring natural light into the building. Later that year, the roof-facing of the Superdome was also remodeled, restoring the roof with a solid white hue. Between 2009 and 2010, the entire outer layer of the stadium, more than {{convert|400000|sqft|m2}} of aluminum siding, was replaced with new aluminum panels and insulation, returning the building to its original champagne bronze colored exterior. An innovative barrier system for drainage was also added, allowing the dome to resemble its original facade.

In addition, escalators were added to the outside of the club rooms. Each suite includes modernized rooms with raised ceilings, leather sofas, and flat-screen TVs, as well as glass brushed aluminum and wood-grain furnishings. A new $600,000 point-of-sale system was also installed, allowing fans to purchase concessions with credit cards throughout the stadium for the first time.

During the summer of 2010, the Superdome installed {{convert|111831|sqft|m2}} of the UBU Speed S5-M synthetic turf system, an Act Global brand. In 2017 Act Global installed a new turf in time for the NFL Season.  For the 2018 , 2019 and 2020 NFL seasons Turf Nation Inc located in Dalton , GA have supplied the synthetic turf system for the Superdome, The Superdome has, as of 2017, the largest continuous synthetic turf system in the NFL.

Beginning in 2011, demolition and new construction began to the lower bowl of the stadium, reconfiguring it to increase seating by 3,500, widening the plaza concourse, building two bunker club lounges and adding additional concession stands. Crews tore down the temporary stairs that led from [[Champions Square]] to the Dome, and replaced them with permanent steps. Installation of express elevators that take coaches and media from the ground level of the stadium to the press box were also completed. New {{convert|7500|sqft|m2|adj=on}} bunker lounges on each side of the stadium were built. The lounges are equipped with flat-screen TVs, granite counter tops and full-service bars. These state-of-the-art lounges can serve 4,500 fans, whose old plaza seats were upgraded to premium tickets, giving those fans leather chairs with cup-holders. The plaza level was extended, closing in space between the concourse and plaza seating, adding new restrooms and concession areas. The renovations also ended the stadium's ability to convert to a baseball configuration.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/story/14605228/superdome-gets-makeover-with-big-games-ahead|title=Superdome gets makeover with big games ahead|publisher=CBS}}</ref> The renovations were completed in late June 2011 in time for the [[Essence Music Festival]].

==== Naming rights ====
The Superdome had not taken on corporate naming rights until Mercedes-Benz USA acquired the rights in 2011. Though the stadium is owned by the state of Louisiana, the New Orleans Saints' lease gives the team the authority to sell the rights.<ref>{{cite news|title=Mercedes-Benz has Superdome deal|url=http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/7058178/mercedes-benz-buys-naming-rights-superdome-home-new-orleans-saints|agency=Associated Press|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=October 4, 2011|date=October 4, 2011}}</ref> Then-Saints owner [[Tom Benson]] also owned Mercedes-Benz dealerships in New Orleans and [[San Antonio]].<ref name="USA_Today_naming_rights" /> At that time, it was the third stadium that had naming rights from Mercedes-Benz (and first in the United States), after the [[Mercedes-Benz Arena (Stuttgart)|Mercedes-Benz Arena]], the stadium of [[Bundesliga]] club [[VfB Stuttgart]], in Stuttgart, Germany, and the [[Mercedes-Benz Arena (Shanghai)|Mercedes-Benz Arena]] in Shanghai, China.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

On July 27, 2012, a statue was unveiled at a plaza next to the Superdome. The work, titled ''Rebirth'', depicts one of the most famous plays in Saints history—[[Steve Gleason]]'s block of a [[Michael Koenen]] punt that the Saints recovered for a touchdown early in the first quarter of the team's first post-Katrina game in the Superdome.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/8207214/new-orleans-saints-unveil-statue-steve-gleason-blocked-punt |title=Steve Gleason statue unveiled |agency=Associated Press |work=ESPN.com |date=July 28, 2012 |accessdate=August 25, 2015}}</ref>

==== {{Visible anchor|Super Bowl XLVII power failure}} ====
The Superdome hosted the [[Super Bowl XLVII]] football game on February 3, 2013. A partial power failure halted game play for about 34 minutes in the third quarter between the [[2012 Baltimore Ravens season|Baltimore Ravens]] and the [[2012 San Francisco 49ers season|San Francisco 49ers]]. It caused [[CBS Sports|CBS]], who was broadcasting the game, to lose some of its cameras as well as voiceovers by the commentators. At no point did the game go off the air, though the game had no audio for about two minutes. While the lights were coming back on, CBS reporters deployed around the stadium reported on the outage as a breaking news situation until power was restored enough for play to continue.

On February 8, 2013, it was reported that a relay device intended to prevent an electrical overload had caused the failure.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://espn.go.com/nfl/playoffs/2012/story/_/id/8929106/super-bowl-xlvii-utility-says-bad-device-caused-super-bowl-blackout|title=Super Vowl XLVII: Device setting caused SB outage|publisher=ESPN|agency=Associated Press|accessdate=9 April 2013}}</ref>  The device was located in an electrical vault owned and operated by [[Entergy]], the electrical utility for the New Orleans area. That vault is approximately one quarter mile away from the Superdome. A subsequent report from an independent auditor confirmed the relay device as the cause.<ref>{{cite web|last=Thompson|first=Richard|title=Reporter|url=http://www.nola.com/business/index.ssf/2013/03/analysis_of_super_bowl_blackou.html|publisher=NOLA Media Group|accessdate=9 April 2013}}</ref> The Superdome's own power system was never compromised.

The Superdome was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/nr/listings/20160205.htm|title=Weekly listing of actions 1/25/16 through 1/29/16|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=2016-02-07}}</ref>

==== {{Visible anchor|End zone scoreboards and new lighting}} ====
During the 2016 off-season, the smaller videoboards formerly located along the end zone walls above the upper seating bowl were replaced with two large [[Panasonic]] [[high-definition television|HD]] [[light emitting diode|LED]] displays that stretch {{convert|330|ft|m}} wide and {{convert|35|ft|m}} tall that are much easier to see throughout the bowl.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nola.com/saints/index.ssf/2016/05/massive_video_boards_in_superd.html|title=Massive new video boards in Superdome almost ready to shine|last=Duncan|first=Jeff|date=27 May 2016|work=[[The Times-Picayune]]|accessdate=2 September 2016}}</ref> Other upgrades included a complete upgrade to the Superdome's interior [[floodlight]]ing system to an efficient LED system with programmable coloring, [[Laser lighting display|light show]] effects, and instant on-off; in normal mode the stadium will have a more vibrant and naturally pleasing system resembling natural daylight.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://sportsnola.com/saints-unveil-new-high-definition-end-zone-boards-superdome-renovations/|title=Saints unveil new high-definition end zone boards, other Superdome renovations|last=Trahan|first=Sabrina|date=24 August 2016|publisher=SportsNOLA.com|accessdate=2 September 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160914223907/http://sportsnola.com/saints-unveil-new-high-definition-end-zone-boards-superdome-renovations/|archive-date=14 September 2016|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.wwl.com/pages/22855954.php?|title=Superdome About To Put On A Show With New Attractions|last=Ames|first=Don|date=26 August 2016|publisher=[[WWL (AM)|WWL Radio]]|accessdate=2 September 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160919011237/http://www.wwl.com/pages/22855954.php|archivedate=19 September 2016}}</ref>

==== {{Visible anchor|Current renovations}} ====
In November 2019, phase one plans were approved by the Louisiana Stadium and Exposition District, commonly known as the Superdome Commission, for a $450 million renovation. The renovation, designed by Trahan Architects, will include atriums that will replace the current ramp system, improved concourses, and field-level end zone boxes.<ref>{{cite web |last1=McAuley |first1=Anthony |date=14 November 2019 |title=$450M Superdome renovation renderings unveiled after construction plans approved |url=https://www.nola.com/news/business/article_c5784afa-06ee-11ea-a1d1-43705b0660a7.html |website=The Advocate Nola.com |accessdate=11 February 2020}}</ref> The first phase of work began January 2020<ref>{{cite web |last1=Adelson |first1=Jeff |date=14 January 2020 |title=National championship was likely the last time you walked some of those Superdome ramps |url=https://www.nola.com/news/article_3b1c8f2c-3706-11ea-9864-abf5c56ae02a.html |website=The Advocate Nola.com |accessdate=11 February 2020}}</ref> and includes installing alternative exits and constructing a large kitchen and food-service area.
