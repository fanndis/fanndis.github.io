The '''Grammy Award for Best Pop Solo Performance''' is an award presented at the [[Grammy Award]]s, a ceremony that was established in 1958 and originally called the Gramophone Awards.<ref name=Grammy>{{cite news|url=http://theenvelope.latimes.com/awards/grammys/env-grammy_awards_info,0,5279018.htmlstory?track=center|title=Grammy Awards at a Glance|work=Los Angeles Times|publisher=[[Tribune Company]]|accessdate=April 24, 2010}}</ref> According to the 54th Grammy Awards description guides the Best Pop Solo Performance Award as being designed for a solo performance pop recording (vocal and instrumental) and is limited to singles or tracks only.<ref name=Categorymapper>{{cite web|url=http://www.grammy.org/recording-academy/announcement/category-mapper/new-category/124673/124753 |title=Category Mapper |accessdate=November 25, 2011 |publisher=[[National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences]] |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120604022508/http://www.grammy.org/recording-academy/announcement/category-mapper/new-category/124673/124753 |archive-date=June 4, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

The category was introduced in 2012 and combined the previous categories for [[Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance|Best Female Pop Vocal Performance]], [[Grammy Award for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance|Best Male Pop Vocal Performance]] and [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Instrumental Performance|Best Pop Instrumental Performance]]. The restructuring of these categories was a result of the Recording Academy's wish to decrease the list of categories and awards and to eliminate the distinctions between male and female (and in some cases, solo instrumental) performances.

The award goes to the performing artist. The producer, engineer and songwriter can apply for a Winners Certificatie.<ref>[https://www.grammy.com/sites/com/files/bluebook_awards_certs_and_grammy_tickets.pdf]</ref>

[[Adele]], with three wins, is the artist with the most awards in the category. [[Kelly Clarkson]] and [[Taylor Swift]] are the artists with the most nominations at four.
