==Notable decisions==
Watford authored the decision of the Ninth Circuit's ''[[en banc]]'' decision in ''[[City of Los Angeles v. Patel]]'' (2014). In that case, the court struck down, 7–4, a Los Angeles city ordinance authorizing police to conduct surprise inspections of hotel and motel guest registries without obtaining the owners' consent or a search warrant. Watford, writing for the court, held that the ordinance violated the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]].<ref>Adam Liptak, [https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/21/us/supreme-court-will-weigh-in-on-police-hotel-searches.html Supreme Court Will Consider Police Searches of Hotel Registries], ''New York Times'' (October 20, 2014).</ref><ref>David G.
