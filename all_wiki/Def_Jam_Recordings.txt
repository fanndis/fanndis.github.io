==Company history==
===Founding and CBS Records Group era (1983–1994)===
Def Jam was co-founded by [[Rick Rubin]] in his dormitory in Weinstein Hall at [[New York University]]<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/02/magazine/02rubin.t.html?pagewanted=all|author=Herschberg, Lynn|title=The Music Man|work=[[New York Times Magazine]]|date=September 2, 2007}}</ref> and its first release was a single by his punk-rock group [[Hose (band)|Hose]]. [[Russell Simmons]] joined Rubin shortly after they were introduced to each other, according to one story, by [[Vincent Gallo]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Turner |first=Edwin |url=http://biblioklept.org/2011/12/17/i-review-def-jam-25-the-overstuffed-illustrated-oral-history-of-a-record-label-that-helped-change-american-culture/ |title=I Review Def Jam 25, the Overstuffed Illustrated Oral History of a Record Label that Helped Change American Culture |publisher=Biblioklept |date=2011-12-17 |access-date=2013-02-28}}</ref> Another cites [[DJ Jazzy Jay]] as their connector.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/jun/13/def-jam-launched-simmons-rubin|title=Def Jam Records launched by Russell Simmons and Rick Rubin|work=The Guardian|date=12 June 2011}}</ref> Rubin has said he met Simmons on the TV show ''[[Graffiti Rock]]'' and recognized him then as "the face of hip hop": "He was five years older than me, and he was already established in the music business. And I had no experience whatsoever."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2011/10/09/141181876/rick-rubin-russell-simmons-def-jams-first-25-years|title=Rick Rubin, Russell Simmons: Def Jam's First 25 Years|publisher=NPR|date=9 October 2011}}</ref> The first single released with the Def Jam Recordings logo was [[T La Rock]] & Jazzy Jay's "It's Yours." The first releases with Def Jam Recordings catalog numbers were [[LL Cool J]]'s "[[I Need a Beat]]" and the [[Beastie Boys]]' "[[Rock Hard]]", both in 1984. The singles sold well, eventually leading to a distribution deal with [[Sony Music Entertainment|CBS Records]] through [[Columbia Records]] the following year.

This created a short-lived subsidiary label called OBR Records, short for Original Black Recordings, which catered toward R&B artists—the first artist signed to that imprint was [[Oran "Juice" Jones]], who enjoyed success with his hit single "[[The Rain (Oran "Juice" Jones song)|The Rain]]". A few years later, Russell Simmons and Lyor Cohen started an umbrella label called Rush Associated Labels to handle Def Jam and its numerous spinoff labels. RAL became the home to [[Nice & Smooth]] and [[EPMD]] after both acts were acquired due to the folding of their former label [[Sleeping Bag Records]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Moore |first1=Maurice |title=Indianapolis: CRUSH Ent Presents: EPMD & DJ Scratch @ The Vogue |url=http://bestevents.us/indianapolis-crush-ent-presents-epmd-amp-dj-scratch-the/418969 |website=bestevents.us |publisher=Best Events |access-date=2015-07-02 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150703034718/http://bestevents.us/indianapolis-crush-ent-presents-epmd-amp-dj-scratch-the/418969 |archive-date=2015-07-03}}</ref> Other acts under the RAL umbrella included [[Redman (rapper)|Redman]], [[Onyx (group)|Onyx]], [[Flatlinerz]], [[Domino (rapper)|Domino]], [[Warren G]] and [[Jayo Felony]]. Def Jam also signed its first and only [[thrash metal]] band, [[Slayer]], in 1986, and the band's [[Reign in Blood|third]] and [[South of Heaven|fourth]] albums were the only two Def Jam releases to be distributed through [[Geffen Records]] under [[Warner Bros. Records]] as opposed to Columbia/CBS. As the decade drew to a close, the label signed [[Public Enemy (band)|Public Enemy]], whose controversial lyrical content garnered the company both critical acclaim and disdain. [[Lyor Cohen]] became president of Def Jam/RAL in 1988, after winning a power struggle with Rubin, who would shortly thereafter leave the company to form [[American Recordings (US)|Def American Recordings]]. Rubin would take [[Slayer]] with him to Def American in its initial stages.

===PolyGram era (1994–1998)===
By 1992, despite recent multi-platinum selling releases from [[Public Enemy (group)|Public Enemy]], and [[EPMD]], Def Jam ran into severe financial troubles and was faced with folding. However, in 1994, [[PolyGram]] purchased Sony's 50% stake in Def Jam Recordings—subsequently bringing the label into its fold. Following PolyGram's purchase, Def Jam distributed the [[Violator Records]]-signed artist [[Warren G]]'s ''[[Regulate... G Funk Era]]'' album, which went triple platinum and brought much-needed revenue to Def Jam through its distribution deal with Violator.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thefreelibrary.com/PolyGram+acquires+50%25+of+Def+Jam.-a015864732|title=PolyGram acquires 50% of Def Jam|publisher=Business Wire|date=1994-11-16|access-date=2017-05-02}}</ref>

PolyGram acquired an additional 10% in Def Jam Recordings in 1996, further strengthening its ownership of Def Jam. Shortly thereafter, Rush Associated Labels was renamed Def Jam Music Group. The label remained profitable as its veteran star LL Cool J released his successful album ''[[Mr. Smith (album)|Mr. Smith]]'' in 1995. The label later signed [[Foxy Brown (rapper)|Foxy Brown]], whose debut album ''[[Ill Na Na]]'' became a platinum seller in 1997.

===The Island Def Jam Music Group founding (1998–2000)===
In 1998, PolyGram was purchased by [[Seagram]] and merged with the MCA family of labels, which became [[Universal Music Group]]. It then purchased the remaining interest of Def Jam Recordings from Russell Simmons for a reported $100 million. UMG merged 14+ record labels including: Def Jam, [[Island Records]] and [[Mercury Records]] to form [[The Island Def Jam Music Group]]. Despite the formation of IDJMG, the Def Jam, Mercury, and Island labels continued to operate as separate imprints underneath the bigger umbrella.

Lyor Cohen was appointed co-president of IDJMG, and [[Kevin Liles]] succeeded him as president of Def Jam. In 1999, IDJMG created a [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] spin-off label called Def Soul Recordings to run alongside Def Jam Recordings, which inherited many of Island Records' urban artists, including [[Dru Hill]] and its lead singer [[Sisqó]], [[the Isley Brothers]] and [[Kelly Price]]. Def Soul also issued recordings by [[Musiq]], [[Montell Jordan]], [[Case (singer)|Case]], [[112 (band)|112]], [[Patti LaBelle]], and [[Christina Milian]]. Island's [[4th & B'way Records]] was also folded into Def Jam. Kevin Liles also served as President of Def Soul Records.

Also in 1999, the label began to distribute releases by [[Murder Inc. Records]], run by former Def Jam executive [[Irv Gotti]]. Murder Inc.'s roster of artists would include [[Ja Rule]], [[Ashanti (entertainer)|Ashanti]], [[Lloyd (singer)|Lloyd]], Vita. The following year, it launched another subsidiary, ''[[Def Jam South]]'', which focused on [[Southern rap]] and distributed releases from labels such as [[Disturbing tha Peace]], whose artists have included [[Ludacris]], [[Chingy]], and [[Bobby Valentino (American singer)|Bobby Valentino]]. Russell Simmons tapped Texas-born and raised rap legend [[Scarface (rapper)|Scarface]] as the original head of Def Jam South. After about a 4-year run at Def Jam South, Scarface negotiated a release from the company in 2003.

===2000s===
In 2000, The Island Def Jam Music Group announced the formation of Def Jam Germany, the first international Def Jam company. This increased the label's presence around the world. Def Jam Germany signed German rappers Spezializtz and Philly MC. The label was located in Berlin and opened on May 23, 2000. In addition to signing and marketing local artists, Def Jam Germany also marketed all U.S. signed Def Jam artists in the German territory. But the German division folded just two years later in 2002. Many of the artists were picked up by Universal/Urban, while others did not get a new contract.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://netzfeuilleton.de/hiphop-geschichte-label-def-jam/ |title=Hiphop Geschichte des Labels DefJam|website=Netzfeuilleton.de |date=2014-11-10 |access-date=2014-11-14}}</ref>

The second international label is a Japanese branch, {{nihongo|Def Jam Japan|デフ・ジャム・ジャパン|Defu Jamu Japan}}, also founded in 2000.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.universal-music.co.jp/defjam/ |title=Def Jam Japan (A Universal Music Company) |website=Universal-music.co.jp |access-date=2011-08-05 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110805202837/http://www.universal-music.co.jp/defjam/ |archive-date=2011-08-05}}</ref> Their artist roster has included [[Ai (singer)|AI]], [[Teriyaki Boyz]], Nitro Microphone Underground, and South Korean boy band [[BTS]].

In 2003, Murder Inc. became the center of a [[money laundering]] investigation involving illegal profits from [[Illegal drug trade|drug trade]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,145482,00.html |title=Hip-Hop's Irv 'Gotti' Surrenders to FBI - Celebrity Gossip &#124; Entertainment News &#124; Arts And Entertainment |website=Foxnews.com |date=2005-01-27 |access-date=2011-08-05}}</ref> leading to the label's eventual release from its distribution contract by 2005. The final shares of [[Roc-A-Fella Records]] were sold to The Island Def Jam Music Group in 2004, by which time it had launched the career of producer-turned-rapper [[Kanye West]].

In 2004, [[Lyor Cohen|Cohen]] left IDJMG for [[Warner Music Group]], and was replaced by former [[Arista Records|Arista]] and later [[Epic Records|Epic]] executive [[L.A. Reid]]. An unhappy Liles eventually decided to follow Cohen to Warner.<ref name="jayzsuit">Ogunnaike, Lola (Aug. 28, 2005). "[https://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/28/arts/music/28ogun.html?_r=1&oref=slogin Jay-Z, From Superstar to Suit]". ''[[The New York Times]]''. Retrieved March 23, 2008.</ref> A bidding war for [[Jay-Z]]'s contract began, and Reid appointed Jay-Z president of Def Jam.<ref name="jayzsuit" />

Under Jay-Z's leadership, Def Jam launched the successful careers of contemporary R&B singers [[Rihanna]] and [[Ne-Yo]]. At the end of 2007, Jay-Z decided not to renew his contract as the President and CEO of Def Jam in order to start his new venture, [[Roc Nation]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Reid |first=Shaheem |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1578538/20071224/jay_z.jhtml |title=Jay-Z Stepping Down As Def Jam President/CEO |publisher=MTV News |date=2007-12-24 |access-date=2011-08-05}}</ref> Following Jay-Z's departure, L.A. Reid took over leadership of the label, as opposed to hiring a replacement. In June 2008, [[Shakir Stewart]] was appointed as Executive Vice President of Def Jam, a position that was previously left vacant since December 2007.

===2010s===
In March 2011, it was announced that former [[Warner Bros. Records]] executive [[Joie Manda]] would become the first president of Def Jam since [[Jay-Z]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1681053/def-jam-new-president-joie-manda.jhtml |author=Markman, Rob|title=Def Jam Names Joie Manda New President|publisher=[[MTV.com]] |date=2012-03-12 |access-date=2011-08-05}}</ref> Until March 2013 when he exited his post at Def Jam and it was announced he'd be heading up the urban division of Interscope Records by his former boss, Barry Weiss.<ref>{{cite web|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|title=Joie Manda Resigns as Def Jam President, Moving to Interscope|author=Aswad, Jem|date=March 28, 2013|url=http://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/record-labels/1554917/joie-manda-resigns-as-def-jam-president-moving-to-interscope}}</ref> [[The-Dream]] served as Def Jam's executive vice president of [[A&R]] at Def Jam between 2012 and 2014.

On April 1, 2014, it was announced that Island Def Jam would no longer be active following the resignation of CEO Barry Weiss. A press release serviced by Universal Music Group stated that IDJMG, and all of its assets would be reorganized into Def Jam Recordings, [[Island Records]] and [[Motown Records]], all as separate entities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/news/2014/04/island-def-jam-will-longer-exist/|title=Island Def Jam Is Over|author=miranda|date=1 April 2014|work=XXL Mag}}</ref>

Def Jam Recordings operates as a stand-alone label within Universal Music Group. Def Jam signed [[DaniLeigh]] to the label in early 2017. Steve Bartels served a time as President/CEO of Def Jam Recording until it was announced on August 3, 2017 that as of January 2018, [[Eminem]]'s longtime manager and co-founder of [[Shady Records]], [[Paul Rosenberg (music manager)|Paul Rosenberg]] has been appointed Chairman/CEO of Def Jam Recordings.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/business/7889714/paul-rosenberg-ceo-def-jam-eminem-manager|title=Eminem's Manager Paul Rosenberg Named New CEO of Def Jam|work=Billboard|access-date=2017-08-03}}</ref> On February 21, 2020, Paul Rosenberg stepped down on his position as CEO of Def Jam.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.54664/title.paul-rosenberg-steps-down-as-def-jam-recordings-ceo-chairman|title=Paul Rosenberg Steps Down As Def Jam Recordings' CEO/Chairman|first=HipHopDX-|last=https://hiphopdx.com|date=February 22, 2020|website=HipHopDX}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.revolt.tv/news/2020/2/23/21149700/paul-rosenberg-steps-down-ceo-def-jam|title=Paul Rosenberg steps down from his CEO position at Def Jam|last=Woods|first=Aleia|date=2020-02-23|website=REVOLT|language=en|access-date=2020-02-24}}</ref>

On September 17, 2019, the launch of Def Jam South East Asia was announced at Music Matters, an annual music industry conference held in [[Singapore]], where [[Joe Flizzow]] from Malaysia, [[Daboyway]] from Thailand, Yung Raja, Fariz Jabba and [[Alif (rapper)|Alif]] from Singapore and A.
