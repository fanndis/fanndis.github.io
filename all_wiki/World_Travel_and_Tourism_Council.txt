==History==
The WTTC began in the 1980s with a group of business executives led by former [[American Express]] CEO [[James D. Robinson III]].<ref name="CglobalCitiz"/> The group was formed to discuss the travel and tourism industry and the need for more data relating to the importance of what some believed was a non-essential industry.<ref name="CglobalCitiz"/> Discussions led to the first meeting of the WTTC in [[Paris]], [[France]] in 1989. The first meeting included a speech by former United States Secretary of State [[Henry Kissinger]] who suggested that the travel and tourism industry was not widely recognized due to its not having any organisation or structure. The WTTC was officially established in 1990.<ref name="wttchistory">{{cite web|title=A History of the World Travel & Tourism Council|website=WTTC|url=http://wttc.org/site_media/uploads/downloads/WTTC_History_1.pdf | accessdate = 6 March 2014}}</ref>

The first annual general meeting took place in Washington, DC, in 1991, at which time the council was composed of 32 members.<ref name="wttchistory"/> These initial members agreed on the need for a common effort to promote awareness of the economic contribution made by the travel and tourism industry. The founding members provided investment and support to produce economic data that could demonstrate the importance of the industry. They shared an interest in ensuring greater interest from governments and policy-makers in order to ensure the success of travel and tourism.<ref name="wttchistory"/>

Robert H Burns took over as chairman of the WTTC in 1993, at which time there were 68 members. It began releasing tourism impact information around the same time,<ref name="BusinessofTourismConcept"/> working with [[Wharton Econometric Forecasting Associates]] to develop the data. The WTTC formed a group known as the Tourism Satellite Account (TSA) to compile and release the data. The TSA was recognized by the United Nations Statistical Commission in 1999. During the 1990s, the WTTC expanded the activities of the council to include education and training, air transport liberalisation, taxation, and sustainable development. The new activities led to the creation of the World Travel & Tourism Human Resources Centre in Vancouver and the World Travel & Tourism Taxation Policy Centre in the United States.<ref name="wttchistory"/>

In 1997, the WTTC organised the first Global Travel and Tourism Summit in Vilamoura, Portugal.<ref name="twYellowflag"/> Membership in the organisation reached 100 the same year.<ref name="twYellowflag"/> Two more summits were held in Vilamoura in 2000 and 2003, which were followed with annual meetings held in various locations.<ref name="wttchistory"/>

In 2013, the WTTC created the Hotel Carbon Measurement Initiative in partnership with the International Tourism Partnership.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hotelnewsresource.com/article71997.html|title=Hotel Carbon Measurement Initiative - 15,000 Hotels and Rising - By Scott Parisi|website=www.hotelnewsresource.com|access-date=2019-10-22}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sustainablebrands.com/read/marketing-and-comms/hilton-worldwide-saves-250-million-from-energy-efficiency-in-4-years|title=Hilton Worldwide Saves $250 Million from Energy Efficiency in 4 Years|last=read Hower|first=Mike|date=2013-11-07|website=Sustainable Brands|language=en|access-date=2019-10-22}}</ref>
