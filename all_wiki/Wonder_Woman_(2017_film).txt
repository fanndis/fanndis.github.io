'''''Wonder Woman''''' is a 2017 American [[superhero film]] based on the [[DC Comics]] character [[Wonder Woman|of the same name]], produced by [[DC Films]] in association with [[RatPac Entertainment]] and Chinese company [[Tencent Pictures]], and distributed by [[Warner Bros. Pictures]]. It is the fourth installment in the [[DC Extended Universe]] (DCEU).<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/07/21/dc-finally-names-its-movie-brand-comic-con-2018 |title=DC Finally Names Its Movie Brand – Comic-Con 2018 |last=Wade |first=Jessie |date=July 21, 2018 |website=IGN |access-date=July 22, 2018}}</ref> Directed by [[Patty Jenkins]] from a screenplay by [[Allan Heinberg]] and a story by Heinberg, [[Zack Snyder]], and [[Jason Fuchs]], ''Wonder Woman'' stars [[Gal Gadot]] in the title role, alongside [[Chris Pine]], [[Robin Wright]], [[Danny Huston]], [[David Thewlis]], [[Connie Nielsen]], [[Elena Anaya]], and [[Saïd Taghmaoui]].

Development of a live-action Wonder Woman film began in 1996, with [[Ivan Reitman]] to produce and possibly direct. The project floundered in [[development hell]] for many years; [[Jon Cohen (writer)|Jon Cohen]], [[Todd Alcott]], and [[Joss Whedon]], among others, were also attached to the project at various points. Warner Bros. announced the film in 2010 and Jenkins signed on to direct in 2015. Inspiration for ''Wonder Woman'' was drawn from Wonder Woman creator [[William Moulton Marston]]'s 1940s stories and [[George Pérez]]'s 1980s stories about Wonder Woman, as well as [[the New 52]] incarnation of the character. Principal photography began on November 21, 2015, with filming taking place in the United Kingdom, France, and Italy before finishing on May 6, 2016, the 123rd anniversary of Marston's birth. Additional filming took place in November 2016.

''Wonder Woman'' had its world premiere in Shanghai on May 15, 2017, and was released in the United States on June 2, 2017, in [[4DX]], [[RealD 3D]], and [[IMAX 3D]] by [[Warner Bros. Pictures]]. The film received largely positive <!--DO ''not'' PUT ACCLAIM --> reviews, with praise for its direction, acting, visuals, action sequences, and musical score.<ref name="reviews" /> It grossed over $821&nbsp;million worldwide, making it the [[2017 in film#Highest-grossing films|tenth highest-grossing film of 2017]], as well as the highest-grossing film by a solo female director.<ref name="marketwatch1">{{cite web |last=Williams |first=Trey |url=http://www.marketwatch.com/story/wonder-woman-passes-mamma-mia-as-highest-grossing-film-by-female-director-2017-06-23 |title='Wonder Woman' passes 'Mamma Mia!' as highest-grossing film by female director |work=MarketWatch |date=June 24, 2017 |access-date=July 5, 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170623211432/http://www.marketwatch.com/story/wonder-woman-passes-mamma-mia-as-highest-grossing-film-by-female-director-2017-06-23 |archivedate=June 23, 2017}}</ref> The [[American Film Institute]] selected it as one of the [[American Film Institute Awards 2017#Top 10 Films|top ten films of 2017]] and it won the [[Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation]] in 2018.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.afi.com/afiawards/AFI-Awards-2017.aspx |title=AFI Awards 2017 |work=[[American Film Institute|AFI]] |access-date=December 8, 2017}}</ref> A sequel, ''[[Wonder Woman 1984]]'', is scheduled to be released on December 25, 2020, with Jenkins returning as director, and Gadot, Pine, Wright and Nielsen reprising their roles.

==Plot==
<!-- ATTENTION!: Please see WP:FILMPLOT before editing. A plot summary for a film article should be 400–700 words, and should not go below or exceed the required limit. -->
In present-day [[Paris]], [[Diana Prince (DC Extended Universe)|Diana Prince]] receives a [[photographic plate]] from [[Wayne Enterprises]] (accompanied by a letter from [[Bruce Wayne (DC Extended Universe)|Bruce Wayne]]) of herself and four men taken during [[World War I]], prompting her to recall her past. The daughter of [[Hippolyta (DC Comics)|Queen Hippolyta]], Diana is raised on the hidden island of [[Themyscira (DC Comics)|Themyscira]], home to the [[Amazons (DC Comics)|Amazons]], women warriors created by the Olympian gods to protect mankind. Hippolyta explains their history to Diana, including how [[Ares (DC Comics)|Ares]] became jealous of humanity and orchestrated its destruction. When the other gods attempted to stop him, Ares killed all but Zeus, who used the last of his power to wound Ares and force his retreat. Before dying, Zeus left the Amazons a weapon, the "Godkiller", to prepare them for Ares's return. Hippolyta reluctantly agrees to let her sister, General [[Antiope (comics)|Antiope]], train Diana as a warrior.

In 1918, Diana, now a young woman, rescues US pilot Captain [[Steve Trevor]] when his plane crashes off the Themysciran coast. The island is soon invaded by [[Imperial German Navy|German]] soldiers, who had been pursuing Steve. The Amazons kill the crew, but Antiope sacrifices herself to save Diana. Steve is interrogated with the [[Lasso of Truth|Lasso of Hestia]] and reveals that a [[World War I|great war]] is consuming the outside world and that he is an [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] spy. He has stolen a notebook from the [[German Empire|Germans']] chief chemist, [[Doctor Poison|Dr. Isabel Maru]], who is attempting to engineer a deadlier form of [[mustard gas]] under the orders of General [[Erich Ludendorff]]. Believing Ares to be responsible for the war, Diana arms herself with the "Godkiller" sword, the lasso, and armor before leaving Themyscira with Steve to locate and stop Ares for good.

In [[London]], they deliver Maru's notebook to the [[Supreme War Council]], where Sir Patrick Morgan is trying to negotiate an [[armistice]] with Germany. Diana translates Maru's notes, revealing that the Germans plan to release the deadly gas at the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]]. Although forbidden by his commander to act, Steve, with secret funding from Morgan, recruits Moroccan spy Sameer, Scottish marksman Charlie, and Native American smuggler Chief Napi to help prevent the gas from being released. The team reaches the front in [[Belgium in World War I|Belgium]]. Diana goes alone through [[No Man's Land]] and captures the enemy trench, liberating the nearby village of Veld with the aid of the Allied forces. The team briefly celebrates, taking a photograph in the village, where Diana and Steve fall in love.

The team learns that a gala will be held at the nearby [[Oberste Heeresleitung|German High Command]]. Steve and Diana separately infiltrate the party; Steve intends to locate the gas and destroy it, and Diana hopes to kill Ludendorff, believing that he is Ares. Steve stops her to avoid jeopardizing his mission, but this allows Ludendorff to unleash the gas on Veld, killing its inhabitants. Blaming Steve for intervening, Diana pursues Ludendorff to a base where the gas is being loaded into a bomber aircraft bound for London. Diana fights and kills him, but is confused and disillusioned when his death does not stop the war.

Morgan appears and reveals himself as Ares. He tells Diana that although he has subtly given humans ideas and inspirations, it is ultimately their decision to resort to violence, as they are inherently corrupt. When Diana attempts to kill Ares with the "Godkiller" sword, he destroys it, telling Diana that as the daughter of Zeus and Hippolyta she herself is the "Godkiller". He fails to persuade Diana to help him destroy mankind in order to restore paradise on Earth. While the two battle, Steve's team destroys Maru's laboratory. Steve hijacks and pilots the bomber carrying the poison to a safe altitude and detonates it, blowing up the plane and himself. Ares attempts to direct Diana's rage and grief at Steve's death by convincing her to kill Maru, but the memories of her experiences with Steve cause her to realize that humans have good within them. She spares Maru and redirects Ares's lightning into him, killing him for good. Later, the team celebrates the [[Armistice of 11 November 1918|end of the war]].

In the present day, Diana sends an email to Bruce Wayne thanking him for the photographic plate of her and Steve. She continues to fight on the world's behalf as Wonder Woman, understanding that only love can truly save the world.

Yes, swords and knives and arrows, but the precision that they have, right, as these warrior women; it's so nice to see that disparity between what we had in the day of just raw fighting materials and the guns and how easy that is in comparison."

===Casting===
{{quote box
 |quote    = I remember when I read in the news that Wonder Woman had been cast and my heart sank ... I'm sure we wouldn't have made the same choice. And then I started paying attention to her, and watching her and looking at her and it was just unbelievable. Frankly, I think they did a better job than I could have because I don't know that I would have scoured the earth as hard to find her ... They were looking for all the same things I would have looked for—all the values that Wonder Woman stands for exuding from someone in an honest way, and boy did they find it ... She shares every quality with Wonder Woman and that's no joke. It's one of those rare things. You need someone who can appear to be Wonder Woman on screen ... Every once in a while, there's superhero casting that transcends, because that person is so authentic to the character that it becomes identified with them, like [[Lynda Carter]] or [[Christopher Reeve]].

To find the perfect location to shoot the Amazon island of Themyscira, the birthplace of Wonder Woman herself, the film's producers searched all over the world, finally settling on the [[Cilentan Coast]]: a stretch of coastline on the [[Tyrrhenian Sea]], located in the [[Province of Salerno]] in Southern Italy.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/movies/a9964101/where-wonder-woman-cast-stayed-italy |title=Here Are the Magical Places the Cast of Wonder Woman Stayed in Italy |work=Cosmopolitan |first=Laura |last=Beck |date=June 1, 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170606125235/http://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/movies/a9964101/where-wonder-woman-cast-stayed-italy/ |archivedate=June 6, 2017}}</ref> It was chosen because most beaches in the world that sit below big cliffs disappear beneath the tide for part of every day. Production designer [[Aline Bonetto]] and her location manager Charles Somers considered 47 countries and visited several of them before they found what they were looking for. Bonetto explained that, "Italy had beautiful weather, a beautiful blue-green sea, not too much tide, not too much wave. Our effects team added some cliffs in post-production, and it was the perfect way to go".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2017-06-02/where-is-wonder-womans-idyllic-island-themiscyra |title=Where is Wonder Woman's idyllic island Themiscyra? |work=Radio Times |date=June 2, 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170615233556/http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2017-06-02/where-is-wonder-womans-idyllic-island-themiscyra |archivedate=June 15, 2017}}</ref> The estuary at [[Lower Halstow]] in [[Kent]] is featured in the scene in which Diana arrives at a Belgian creek to make her way to the warfront.<ref>{{cite web |author=Kent Film Office |url=http://kentfilmoffice.co.uk/2017/06/wonder-woman-2017/ |title=Kent Film Office Wonder Woman Article}}</ref> [[Bill Westenhofer]] served as the visual effects supervisor for the film<ref>{{cite web |url=https://variety.com/2015/artisans/news/gersh-cec-wpa-book-clients-1201559272/ |title=Gersh, CEC, WPA Book Clients |work=Variety |first=Peter |last=Caranicas |date=August 7, 2015 |access-date=August 10, 2015 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150809114814/http://variety.com/2015/artisans/news/gersh-cec-wpa-book-clients-1201559272/ |archivedate=August 9, 2015}}</ref> and [[Martin Walsh (film editor)|Martin Walsh]] served as editor.<ref name="auto" />

The success of the superhero television series ''[[Supergirl (TV series)|Supergirl]]'' informed the marketing and promotion strategy used for ''Wonder Woman''.<ref name="Mueller">{{cite web |first=Matthew |last=Mueller |title=How Supergirl Influenced Wonder Woman's Marketing |url=https://comicbook.com/dc/2017/04/27/how-supergirl-influenced-wonder-womans-marketing/ |work=Comicbook.com |date=April 27, 2017 |access-date=May 3, 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170506191241/http://comicbook.com/dc/2017/04/27/how-supergirl-influenced-wonder-womans-marketing/ |archivedate=May 6, 2017}}</ref> According to [[Time Warner]] chief marketing officer Kristen O'Hara, they wanted to approach the ''Wonder Woman'' marketing campaign in a light manner, similar to how they did with ''Supergirl''.

That's who she is; that's Wonder Woman."<ref name="lat0517" /> [[Gal Gadot]] concurred with Jenkins, arguing that the character "is a feminist"<ref name="ew0517">{{cite web |url=https://ew.com/movies/2017/05/18/gal-gadot-wonder-woman-feminist/ |title=Gal Gadot: 'Of course' Wonder Woman is a feminist |access-date=September 13, 2017 |last=Sperling |first=Nicole |date=May 18, 2017 |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]}}</ref> as "feminism is about equality and choice and freedom.

Critic Valerie Estelle Frankel supported Jenkins's vision. Frankel argues that the film subverts the [[male gaze]],<ref name="mic0217" /> stating that the construction of Wonder Woman tends to shift every few decades as it reflects the state of feminism during different time periods, including [[third-wave feminism]] (which reflects Jenkins's approach).<ref name="mic0217" /><ref name="db17">{{cite web |url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/why-wonder-woman-is-the-feminist-hero-we-need-now |title='Wonder Woman' is the Feminist Hero We've Been Waiting For |access-date=September 16, 2017 |last=Leon |first=Melissa |date=June 2, 2017 |work=[[The Daily Beast]]}}</ref><ref name="mw0617">{{cite web |url=http://www.marketwatch.com/story/wonder-woman-soared-to-no-1-at-the-perfect-time-for-millions-of-teenage-girls-2017-06-05 |title=Why millions of teenage girls need 'Wonder Woman' now more than ever |access-date=September 13, 2017 |last=Fottrell |first=Quentin |date=June 12, 2017 |work=[[MarketWatch]]}}</ref> Zoe Williams offers a similar argument, stating that while Wonder Woman "is sort of naked a lot of the time," that is not, at the same time, "objectification so much as a cultural reset: having thighs, actual thighs you can kick things with, not thighs that look like arms, is a feminist act".<ref name="guard06517">{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/jun/05/why-wonder-woman-is-a-masterpiece-of-subversive-feminism |title=Why Wonder Woman is a masterpiece of subversive feminism |access-date=September 13, 2017 |last=Williams |first=Zoe |date=June 5, 2017 |work=[[The Guardian]]}}</ref> Williams then juxtaposes Wonder Woman with past female action heroes [[Sarah Connor (Terminator)|Sarah Connor]], [[Ellen Ripley]], and [[Lara Croft]], whom she suggests were all constructed for the [[male gaze]], in which a "female warrior becomes a sex object", (a point which she argues that Jenkins directly references in the film).<ref name="guard06517" />

Gloria Steinem also liked the film, stating that she felt it made the "Amazon origin story clear; [Wonder Woman] was stopping war, not perpetuating it." Steinem also noted that she knew "some women were disappointed by all the makeup, but I may be desperate—I was just happy that the Amazons had wild hair!" Her only complaint lay in the choice to eliminate the World War II setting as the Wonder Woman comic book developed in response to existing comics that were "so sadistic and racist that there was a congressional hearing on the subject".<ref name="vf1017">{{cite web |url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/10/gloria-steinem-wonder-woman |title=How Gloria Steinem Saved Wonder Woman |access-date=October 10, 2017 |last=Desta |first=Yohana |date=October 10, 2017 |work=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]}}</ref> Steinem also gave [[Hillary Clinton]] the first ''Wonder Woman Award'' in October 2017 during the [[Women's Media Center]]'s "Speaking Truth to Power Awards" (an organization created by Steinem, [[Jane Fonda]], and [[Robin Morgan]]). Upon receiving the award, Clinton noted that she had seen Jenkins's ''Wonder Woman'' film and that she "loved the outfit". She also said that as her granddaughter was "really keen" on Wonder Woman, Clinton "thought maybe I could borrow something from her for the night. It didn't quite work for me, but I will say that this award means a lot to me because as a little girl, and then as a young woman, and then as a slightly older woman, I always wondered when Wonder Woman would have her time, and now that has happened."<ref name="hcvfww17">{{cite web |url=https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2017/10/hillary-clinton-wonder-woman-award |title=Read Hillary Clinton's Full Speech Accepting the Wonder Woman Award |access-date=October 27, 2017 |last=Lindsay |first=Benjamin |date=October 27, 2017 |work=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]}}</ref> Clinton had previously praised Jenkins's film, in a public August 2017 message, stating that "it was just as inspirational as I'd suspected a movie about a strong, powerful woman in a fight to save the world from international disaster would be."<ref name="cosmo0817">{{cite web |url=http://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/movies/a12121722/patty-jenkins-lucy-davis-wonder-woman-dvd-interview/ |title=Patty Jenkins and Lucy Davis Respond to Hillary Clinton's Wonder Woman Praise |access-date=October 28, 2017 |last=Brounstein |first=Laura |date=August 29, 2017 |work=[[Cosmopolitan (magazine)|Cosmopolitan]]}}</ref><ref name="ew0817">{{cite web |url=https://ew.com/movies/2017/08/30/patty-jenkins-responds-wonder-woman-praise-hillary-clinton/ |title=Patty Jenkins responds to Hillary Clinton's praise of Wonder Woman |access-date=October 28, 2017 |last=Bruner |first=Raisa |date=August 30, 2017 |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]}}</ref><ref name="hc0817">{{cite web |url=https://still4hill.com/2017/08/22/email-from-hillary-clinton-4/ |title=Email from Hillary Clinton: August 22, 2017 |access-date=October 28, 2017 |last=Clinton |first=Hillary |date=August 22, 2017 |work=still4hill.com}}</ref>

Director [[James Cameron]] continued this debate, through his critique of the representation of female power in Jenkins's film. In an August 2017 interview with ''[[The Guardian]]'', Cameron qualifies Jenkins's vision of Wonder Woman as "an objectified icon" and called the film "a step backwards". In contrast, he states, his character Sarah Connor (from his [[Terminator (franchise)|''Terminator'']] films) "was not a beauty icon. She was strong, she was troubled, she was a terrible mother, and she earned the respect of the audience through pure grit."<ref name="camcritiqueww">{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/aug/24/james-cameron-well-never-be-able-to-reproduce-the-shock-of-terminator-2 |title=James Cameron: 'The downside of being attracted to independent women is that they don't need you' |access-date=August 25, 2017 |last=Freeman |first=Hadley |date=August 25, 2017 |work=[[The Guardian]]}}</ref> Jenkins stated in response that Cameron's "inability to understand what 'Wonder Woman' is, or stands for, to women all over the world is unsurprising as, though he is a great filmmaker, he is not a woman". She further argued "there is no right and wrong kind of powerful woman" because "if women have to always be hard, tough and troubled to be strong, and we aren't free to be multidimensional or celebrate an icon of women everywhere because she is attractive and loving, then we haven't come very far have we."<ref name="jenkinsrespcam">{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/aug/25/patty-jenkins-hits-back-at-james-cameron-criticism-of-wonder-woman |title=Patty Jenkins hits back at James Cameron: 'He doesn't understand Wonder Woman' |access-date=August 25, 2017 |last=Mumford |first=Gwilym |date=August 25, 2017 |work=[[The Guardian]]}}</ref> Reaction to this debate was mixed. Julie Miller sided with Cameron, whom she states refers to himself as "a pretty hardcore feminist" and who told ''Vulture'' that "I have no problem writing a script in which the males become subservient to the females, which is what happens in [[Aliens (film)|''Aliens'']] ... It's up to [[Ellen Ripley|Ripley]] to win the day." In contrast, Miller argues that Jenkins and Gadot envisioned Wonder Woman as "a woman who exuded both femininity and strength, along with genuine confusion as to why men would treat women differently than they do other men".<ref name="vf082517">{{cite web |url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/08/wonder-woman-james-cameron-patty-jenkins |title=Patty Jenkins Responds to James Cameron's Unsolicited Wonder Woman Criticism |access-date=September 16, 2017 |last=Miller |first=Julie |date=August 25, 2017 |work=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]}}</ref> Susannah Breslin also agreed with Cameron, describing Jenkins's Wonder Woman as "a Playmate with a lasso" and "female power with no balls".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/susannahbreslin/2017/08/26/james-cameron-wonder-woman/ |title=What James Cameron Gets Right About The 'Wonder Woman' Feminism Debate (Forbes) |access-date=September 16, 2017 |last=Breslin |first=Susannah |date=August 26, 2017 |work=[[Forbes]]}}</ref> Others were more critical of Cameron's critique.<ref name="EW082417">{{cite web |url=https://ew.com/movies/2017/08/24/wonder-woman-director-james-cameron/ |title=Patty Jenkins responds to James Cameron's Wonder Woman diss |access-date=September 16, 2017 |last=Rosen |first=Christopher |date=August 24, 2017 |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]}}</ref> An article in ''[[Newsweek]]'' suggests that in contrast to his criticism of Jenkins, Cameron's own films include "lot of objectification" and quotes a few Hollywood celebrities who echoed this view.

A few weeks later in September, Cameron reiterated his criticism in an interview with ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]''. He compared [[Gal Gadot]]'s representation of the character to [[Raquel Welch#One Million Years B.C.|Raquel Welch]] films of the 1960s,<ref name="hrsept17">{{cite web |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/features/james-cameron-doubles-down-wonder-woman-critique-details-avatar-sequels-1043026 |title=James Cameron Doubles Down on 'Wonder Woman' Critique, Details the 'Avatar' Sequels |access-date=October 1, 2017 |last=Masters |first=Kim |date=September 27, 2017 |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]}}</ref> and reinforced a comparison with [[Linda Hamilton]]'s portrayal of Sarah Connor. He argued that Connor was "if not ahead of its time, at least a breakthrough in its time" because though she "looked great", she "wasn't treated as a sex object".<ref name="hrsept17" /> He also stated that he while he "applaud[s] Patty directing the film and Hollywood, uh, 'letting' a woman direct a major action franchise, I didn't think there was anything groundbreaking in ''Wonder Woman''. I thought it was a good film. Period."<ref name="hrsept17" /> Former Wonder Woman actress [[Lynda Carter]] responded to Cameron's ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' interview by asking him to "Stop dissing WW." Like Jenkins, she suggests that while Cameron does "not understand the character", she does. She also refers to Cameron's critiques as "thuggish jabs at a brilliant director" that are as "ill advised" as the "movie was spot on." Carter also states that she has the authority to make these observations because she has "embodied this character for more than 40 years".<ref name="guardian0917">{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/sep/29/wonder-woman-lynda-carter-thuggish-james-cameron-patty-jenkins |title=Lynda Carter attacks 'thuggish' James Cameron over Wonder Woman jibes |access-date=October 1, 2017 |last=Mumford |first=Gwilym |date=September 29, 2017 |work=[[The Guardian]]}}</ref><ref name="var0917">{{cite web |url=https://variety.com/2017/film/news/lynda-carter-james-cameron-wonder-woman-1202576085/ |title=Lynda Carter to James Cameron: 'Stop Dissing' 'Wonder Woman' |access-date=October 1, 2017 |last=Nyren |first=Erin |date=September 28, 2017 |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]}}</ref><ref name="cnn0917">{{cite web |url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/09/29/entertainment/lynda-carter-james-cameron/index.html |title=Lynda Carter calls out James Cameron over 'Wonder Woman' |access-date=October 1, 2017 |last=Respers |first=Lisa |date=September 28, 2017 |work=[[CNN]]}}</ref> A month later, Jenkins responded to Cameron's comments once again in an interview with ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', stating that she "was not upset at all", as "everybody is entitled to their own opinion.

She also states that it "is not enough to simply call yourself a feminist. It's not even enough to create a strong female character ... You have to bring women to the table. You have to let them speak. You cannot speak for them. But speaking for women is exactly what Cameron is doing through his comments ...
