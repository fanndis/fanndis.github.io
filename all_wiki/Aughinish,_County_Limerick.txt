'''Aughinish''' is a former island (now [[peninsula]]) in the [[River Shannon|Shannon]] estuary, in [[County Limerick]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], near [[Foynes]].

[[Rusal]] Aughinish, Europe's largest [[bauxite]] refinery, is located on the island.<ref name=Independent>{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/business/irish/profits-plunge-80pc-at-aughinish-alumina-28818519.html|title=Profits plunge 80pc at Aughinish Alumina|publisher=Irish Independent|date=8 October 2012|accessdate=11 May 2013}}</ref> The site includes a deep-water jetty in the Shannon<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.top1000.ie/limerick-alumina |title=Top 1000: Limerick Alumina |publisher=Irish Times |accessdate=11 May 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131003215431/http://www.top1000.ie/limerick-alumina |archivedate= 3 October 2013 }}</ref> through which the refinery imports bauxite from [[Guinea]] and [[Brazil]] and exports [[alumina]] to be refined into [[aluminium]] metal.<ref name=Independent />

Although most of the island is occupied by industry, it is also the site of Ireland's first butterfly sanctuary, located in an abandoned quarry.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.limerick.ie/smartertravel/walkingroutes/naturetrailsofaughinish/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120919223133/http://limerick.ie/smartertravel/walkingroutes/naturetrailsofaughinish/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=19 September 2012 |title=Nature Trails of Aughinish |publisher=Limerick City Council |accessdate=11 May 2013 }}</ref>
