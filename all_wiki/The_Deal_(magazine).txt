The company generates original and daily articles, commentary and data that cover the world of finance and business through the lens of deal making, focusing on core areas including [[Mergers & Acquisitions]],<ref>[http://www.mondotimes.com/2/topics/5/business/78/13526 Deal Magazine]</ref> [[private equity]], [[venture capital]] financings, bankruptcies and other topics of interest to the [[investment banking]], [[private equity]], [[legal]], [[hedge fund]] and [[venture capital]] industries.

As of 2009 ''The Deal'' had more than 120 employees, including 70 full-time journalists based in the New York headquarters with bureaus across the U.S., London.

The roots of the media company began when The Daily Deal was launched in September 1999 by [[American Lawyer Media]] with strong support from  dealmaker [[Bruce Wasserstein]]. In March 2000, ALM sold the assets of the Deal to [[U.S. Equity Partners]], a [[private equity fund]] sponsored by [[Wasserstein & Co]]. In December 2000, [[Rustic Canyon Ventures]], a [[venture capital firm]] based in Southern California, led a $30 million [[venture round]] of financing.<ref>[http://www.thedeal.com/servlet/ContentServer?pagename=TheDeal/Article/HelpCenter&c=Article&cid=1020451554903 The Deal, MILESTONES AT A GLANCE]</ref> In 2012, ''The Deal'' was acquired by [[TheStreet.com]], who closed the magazine.<ref>[http://www.btobonline.com/article/20121005/MEDIABUSINESS03/310089910/thestreet-buys-the-deal-for-5-8m-combines-marketing-news TheStreet buys The Deal for $5.8M, combines marketing, news operations]</ref><ref>[http://www.thedeal.com/faq2 The Deal FAQ]</ref> After being acquired by The Street, all publications of The Deal became digital and are still available today.
