The '''Scott Trust Limited''' is the British company that owns [[Guardian Media Group]] and thus ''[[The Guardian]]'' and ''[[The Observer]]'' as well as various other media businesses in the UK. In 2008, it replaced the Scott Trust, which had owned ''The Guardian'' since 1936.

The company is responsible for appointing the editor of ''The Guardian'' (and those of the group's other main newspapers) but, apart from enjoining them to continue the paper's editorial policy on "the same lines and in the same spirit as heretofore", it has a policy of not interfering in their decisions. The arrangement tends to give editors a long tenure: for example, the last incumbent, [[Alan Rusbridger]], was there from 1995 until 2015.

The current chair of the Scott Trust Board is [[Alex Graham (producer)|Alex Graham]],<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/sep/22/alex-graham-appointed-chair-scott-trust-guardian-media-group|title=Alex Graham appointed as seventh chair of the Scott Trust|last=Jackson|first=Jasper|date=2016-09-22|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-02-28|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> who replaced [[Liz Forgan]] in 2016.

==History==
===1936–1948===
The Trust was established in 1936 by John Scott, owner of the ''Manchester Guardian'' (as it then was) and the ''[[Manchester Evening News]]''. After the deaths in quick succession of his father [[C. P. Scott]] and brother [[Edward Taylor Scott|Edward]], and consequent threat of [[Inheritance Tax (United Kingdom)|death duties]], John Scott wished to prevent future death duties forcing the closure or sale of the newspapers, and to protect the liberal editorial line of the ''Guardian'' from interference by future proprietors. The first and only Chairman of the first Trust was John Scott.

===1948–2008===
The Trust was dissolved and reformed in 1948, as it was thought that the Trust, under the terms of the original Trust Deed, had become liable to tax due to changes in the law. At this time John Scott also gave up his exclusive right to appoint trustees; the trustees would henceforth appoint new members themselves. Five months after the signing of the new Trust Deed, John Scott died. After three years of legal argument, the [[Inland Revenue]] gave up its claim for death duty.

The eight initial trustees of the 1948 Trust were all connected with the Manchester Guardian and Evening News, Ltd., and included four of C. P. Scott's grandsons as well as the then editor of the ''Guardian'', [[A. P. Wadsworth]]. It has become normal practice for a ''Guardian'' journalist to be a member of the trust, though he or she is not considered to be a "representative" of the staff, as this may result in a conflict of interests.

In 1992, the Trust identified its central objective as being the following:
:"To secure the financial and editorial independence of ''The Guardian'' in perpetuity: as a quality national newspaper without party affiliation; remaining faithful to its liberal tradition; as a profit-seeking enterprise managed in an efficient and cost-effective manner."<ref name=Ellis/>

The Trust saw its main functions as being the following:
*"To secure the Trust's own continuity by renewing its membership and by dealing with threats to its existence
*To monitor the organisation, financial management and overall strategy of the Group, holding the Board accountable for its performance
*To appoint and 'in extreme circumstances' to dismiss the editors of ''The Guardian'', the ''Manchester Evening News'' (and ''The Observer'' after its acquisition in 1993)
*To act as a 'court of appeal' in the event of any dispute between the editorial and managerial sides of the operation."<ref name=Ellis>{{cite book |last=Ellis |first=Gavin |date=2014 |title=Trust Ownership and the Future of News: Media Moguls and White Knights |location=London |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |pages=157–58 |isbn=9781137369437 }}</ref>

The second Trust had five Chairmen over its 60 years: [[Alfred Powell Wadsworth]] (1948–56), [[Richard Farquhar Scott]] (1956–84), [[Alastair Hetherington]] (1984–89), [[Hugo Young]] (1990–2003) and Liz Forgan.

===The Scott Trust Limited: 2008–present===
In October 2008 it was announced that the trust was being wound up and its assets transferred to a new limited company named "The Scott Trust Limited" to ''strengthen the protection it offers to the Guardian'' and because ''[l]ike all non-charitable trusts, and unlike limited companies, the Scott Trust has a finite lifespan''.<ref>{{cite web

| title=Scott Trust updates structure
| date=2008-10-08
| publisher=The Guardian
| accessdate=2019-07-29}}</ref> The core purpose of the Trust was enshrined in the constitution of the Limited company and "cannot be altered or amended."
The new company is barred from paying dividends, and "its constitution has been carefully drafted to ensure that no individual can ever personally benefit from the arrangements."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pressgazette.co.uk/guardian-owning-scott-trust-to-fold-after-72-years/|title=Guardian-owning Scott Trust to fold after 72 years|author=Dominic Ponsford|date=2008-10-08|publisher=[[Press Gazette]]}}</ref>

In February 2010, the company announced the sale of its GMG Regional Media arm and its regional print titles to the [[Trinity Mirror|Trinity Mirror Group]]. The regional titles comprised the ''[[Manchester Evening News]]'' and 31 others in the North West and South of England. The sale was finalised on 28 March 2010 and ended the Scott Trust's association with regional newspapers.

Guardian News and Media, a subsidiary of the Scott Trust Limited, reported a loss of £30.9&nbsp;million for the year to the end of April 2013.<ref name=pg619/>

The company via the Guardian Media Group (GMG, a subsidiary company) completed the sale for £619&nbsp;million of its 50.1% stake in ''[[Auto Trader Group|Auto Trader]]'' on 4 March 2014. [[Apax Partners]], a venture capital firm, increased its share to become the sole shareholder in the business. The £619&nbsp;million earned from the sale of ''Auto Trader'' adds to the £253.7&nbsp;million of cash and investments which GMG published in its 2013 annual report. This leaves an investment fund which is likely to be in excess of £850&nbsp;million to underwrite ''Guardian'' losses.<ref name=pg619>{{cite web

In December 2014, it was announced that [[Alan Rusbridger]], then ''Guardian'' editor-in-chief, would succeed Forgan as the Chairman of the company in 2016<ref>{{cite web

As of 1 April 2018, the value of the Scott Trust Endowment Fund was £1.01 billion, down slightly from £1.03bn in 2017.<ref name="results2018"/>
