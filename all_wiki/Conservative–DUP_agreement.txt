The '''Conservative–DUP agreement''' between the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] and the [[Democratic Unionist Party]] (DUP) followed the [[2017 United Kingdom general election]] which resulted in a [[hung parliament]].

==Conservative–DUP dialogue before 2017==
=== Prior to the 2010 and 2015 general elections ===
Previously the Conservatives cooperated with the DUP's main [[Unionism in Ireland|unionist]] rival, the [[Ulster Unionist Party]] (UUP), whose MPs took the Conservative whip at Westminster until that arrangement was ended in 1974. Relations between the Conservatives and UUP worsened following the [[Anglo-Irish Agreement]] of 1985,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/special/politics97/parties/pauup.shtml|title=Politics 97: Ulster Unionist Party|date=1997|work=BBC News|access-date=29 June 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170506173232/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/special/politics97/parties/pauup.shtml|archive-date=6 May 2017}}</ref> although the two parties continued to work together, especially after the 1992 election when [[John Major]]'s government had to rely on their support.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://inews.co.uk/essentials/news/politics/ulsters-two-unionist-parties-line-behind-tories/|title=Ulster's two unionist parties line up behind the Tories|date=1 June 2017|access-date=11 June 2017|work=iNews|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171205220651/https://inews.co.uk/essentials/news/politics/ulsters-two-unionist-parties-line-behind-tories/|archive-date=5 December 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/john-major-s-future-may-lie-in-unionist-hands-1.18190|title=John Major's future may lie in unionist hands|access-date=10 June 2017|work=The Irish Times}}</ref> In January 2010, the then Conservative leader [[David Cameron]] held talks with both the UUP and DUP about an electoral pact for the [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010 general election]].

=== 2015–17: Conservative majority ===
A formal "draft agreement" between the two parties was reached in the days following the 2015 general election, after that election resulted in a Conservative majority. The draft co-operation deal, which was never ratified and not made public at the time, stated that the DUP agreed to support the government in any [[Motions of no confidence in the United Kingdom|no-confidence motion]], and some other matters, excluding welfare reforms, Northern Ireland related issues and matters relating to devolution of powers throughout the UK.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/06/12/exclusive-conservatives-dup-drew-secret-co-operation-deal-2015/|title=Exclusive: Conservatives and DUP drew up secret co-operation deal after 2015 general election|first=Christopher|last=Hope|date=13 June 2017|work=The Daily Telegraph|access-date=13 June 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170613065818/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/06/12/exclusive-conservatives-dup-drew-secret-co-operation-deal-2015/|archive-date=13 June 2017}}</ref>

The [[2017 United Kingdom general election|2017 snap election]] resulted in a [[hung parliament]], with the Conservative Party having returned the most seats in the House of Commons with 317 Conservative MPs, but without an overall majority needed to govern (326 out of 650 seats).  The DUP, which won 10 seats in the election (its best Westminster electoral performance to date), suggested it would be able to provide a [[coalition government|coalition]] or [[confidence and supply|confidence-and-supply]] arrangement depending on negotiations.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/06/09/suddenly-become-important-democratic-unionist-party-could-hold/|title=Who are the DUP and will they demand a soft Brexit to prop up the Tories?|work=The Daily Telegraph|access-date=9 June 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170609084123/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/06/09/suddenly-become-important-democratic-unionist-party-could-hold/|archive-date=9 June 2017}}</ref> [[Theresa May]], incumbent Conservative prime minister, announced her intention on 9 June 2017 to form a [[Second May ministry|new minority government]] with support from the DUP, whom she described as "friends and allies".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/general-election-2017/general-election-2017-result-live-we-will-work-with-dup-friends-and-allies-in-interests-of-all-uk-says-theresa-may-35806871.html|title=General Election 2017 result live: We will work with DUP friends and allies in interests of all UK, says Theresa May|date=9 June 2017|work=Belfast Telegraph|access-date=9 June 2017}}</ref> Initially, both parties implied that this support would be in the form of a confidence-and-supply agreement, with the DUP backing a Conservative [[Queen's Speech]] and certain other elements of the government's legislative agenda. However, in the afternoon of 10 June, it was reported by [[Robert Peston]] that May was in fact seeking to 'enter into a formal coalition agreement as opposed to the less formal "confidence-and-supply" arrangement', having sent a team of officials headed by [[Chief Whip]] [[Gavin Williamson]] to negotiate a deal in Belfast.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.itv.com/news/2017-06-10/may-wants-formal-coalition-with-dup/|title=May wants formal coalition with DUP|last=Peston|first=Robert|date=10 June 2017|work=ITV News|access-date=10 June 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170610150752/http://www.itv.com/news/2017-06-10/may-wants-formal-coalition-with-dup/|archive-date=2017-06-10|url-status=live}}</ref> Despite this, later that evening it was announced that the DUP had agreed, so far, only to the principles of a "confidence" deal with the Conservatives, which would be discussed by the Cabinet on 12 June.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2017-40236152|title=DUP agrees 'confidence' deal with Tories|date=10 June 2017|work=BBC News|access-date=10 June 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170610184313/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2017-40236152|archive-date=2017-06-10|url-status=live}}</ref>

[[Welsh Labour Party|Welsh Labour]] minister [[Jo Stevens]], the Deputy Leader of the [[Green Party of England and Wales]] [[Amelia Womack]] and the [[British Pregnancy Advisory Service]] criticised the DUP's anti-[[Abortion in the United Kingdom|abortion]] stance and expressed concern about the party's possible influence in the minority government.<ref>{{cite news|title='Chilling' DUP deal raises prospect of change to UK abortion law|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/uk/chilling-dup-deal-raises-prospect-of-change-to-uk-abortion-law-1.3115505|access-date=11 June 2017|work=The Irish Times|date=June 10, 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170611055018/http://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/uk/chilling-dup-deal-raises-prospect-of-change-to-uk-abortion-law-1.3115505|archive-date=11 June 2017}}</ref> [[LGBT+ Conservatives]] and [[Scottish Conservatives]] leader [[Ruth Davidson]] (as she herself pointed out, a Scottish Protestant planning a marriage to an Irish Catholic woman<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/06/09/ruth-davidson-distances-dup-deal-tweeting-link-gay-pride-lecture/|title=Ruth Davidson distances herself from DUP deal by tweeting a link to her gay pride lecture|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170611215821/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/06/09/ruth-davidson-distances-dup-deal-tweeting-link-gay-pride-lecture/|archive-date=2017-06-11|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=2017-06-09|last1=Cramb|first1=Auslan}}</ref>) criticised [[Democratic Unionist Party#Social policies|DUP stances on social issues]], in particular on [[LGBT rights in the United Kingdom|LGBT rights]].

*All [[Motion of confidence|motions of confidence]]
*The [[Queen's Speech]]
*[[Government budget|The Budget]]
*Finance bills, money bills and appropriation legislation
*Legislation pertaining to the [[Brexit|UK's exit from the European Union]]
*Legislation pertaining to national security

Other key points of the agreement include:
*The ongoing commitment of the Conservative Party to the [[Unionism in Ireland|Union]] of Great Britain and Northern Ireland
*The UK's 2% defence spending target will continue to be met, in accordance with [[NATO]] requirements
*Cash support for farmers will remain at current levels until the next election
*Both parties agree to adhere to the provisions of the [[Good Friday Agreement]]
*No poll or referendum on the future of Northern Ireland's constitutional status will be held without the "consent of the people"
*The commitment of the DUP to work towards the formation of a new [[Northern Ireland Executive]]; and the commitment of the UK Government to work with Northern Irish parties and the Irish government on this objective
*Implementation of the [[Armed Forces Covenant]] in Northern Ireland

The agreement stated that votes related to any other matters in the Commons will be agreed on a case-by-case basis, overseen by a coordination committee made up of both parties. The DUP secured an extra £1 billion of funding for Northern Ireland, with the money focused on health, infrastructure and education budgets.<ref name="BBC New"/> Following the announcement of the agreement, the Government stated that this additional funding would not result in increased budgets in Scotland or Wales, as the money will not be subject to the [[Barnett formula]].<ref name="bbc.co.uk">{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-40406346|title='No Barnett formula money for Scotland' through DUP deal|date=26 June 2017|work=BBC News|access-date=26 June 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170626234258/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-40406346|archive-date=2017-06-26|url-status=live|language=en-GB}}</ref> The deal also saw the Conservatives drop their 2017 manifesto commitments to pension and winter fuel allowance changes.

====Reactions to the agreement====
The DUP leader, Arlene Foster, said that the agreement was "good for Northern Ireland and the UK".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-40402352?intlink_from_url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/uk-politics-40403501&link_location=live-reporting-story|title=DUP-Tory deal secures extra spending in Northern Ireland|date=26 June 2017|work=BBC News|access-date=26 June 2017|language=en-GB}}</ref>

Others have questioned whether or not the UK Government can maintain its role as neutral arbiter of the [[Good Friday Agreement]] if its survival depends on the cooperation of a specific unionist political party from Northern Ireland.<ref>''The Andrew Marr Show'', BBC1, 11 June 2017</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://leftfootforward.org/2017/06/how-will-the-northern-irish-power-sharing-be-affected-by-the-tory-dup-friendship/|title=How will the Northern Irish power-sharing be affected by the Tory-DUP 'friendship'?|date=2017-06-09|website=Left Foot Forward|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-06-10}}</ref> The DUP-Conservative deal itself came about with the background of a Northern Ireland Assembly which had been suspended since 26 January 2017, with talks to form a power-sharing executive after the latest [[2017 Northern Ireland Assembly election|Assembly election on 2 March]] yet to prove fruitful.  [[Sinn Féin]] leader [[Martin McGuinness]] claimed that Theresa May was herself already in breach of the Good Friday Agreement and that the new deal could further hamper the formation of a power-sharing executive.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2017/jun/15/tory-dup-deal-in-breach-of-good-friday-agreement-claims-sinn-fein-video|title=Tory-DUP deal 'in breach of Good Friday agreement', claims Sinn Féin – video|last=Reuters|first=Source|date=2017-06-15|work=The Guardian|access-date=2019-06-10|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> He further added in an op-ed to the Guardian that the agreement's provisions for guaranteed funding were taking place after the loss of over a billion pounds over the past 10 years for Northern Ireland and with a Conservative Party whose political agenda (such as pledges to repeal the [[Human Rights Act 1998|Human Rights Act]] and put an end to the [[European Court of Justice]] and the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] jurisdiction in the UK) was, in his opinion, at odds with the foundations of a shared and peaceful future for Northern Ireland under the Good Friday (Belfast) Agreement.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jun/27/dup-tory-deal-good-friday-agreemnt|title=The DUP must not let this Tory deal damage the Good Friday agreement|last=Adams|first=Gerry|author-link=Gerry Adams|date=2017-06-27|work=The Guardian|access-date=2019-06-10|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>

The Leader of the Opposition, [[Jeremy Corbyn]], was critical of the deal, saying that he believed that the "Tory-DUP deal is clearly not in the national interest but in May’s party’s interest to help her cling to power".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/uk-politics-40403501?ns_mchannel=social&ns_source=twitter&ns_campaign=bbc_live&ns_linkname=59510b4be4b0f6b0b8a779bc%26Corbyn%3A%20Tory-DUP%20deal%20not%20in%20national%20interest%26&ns_fee=0#post_59510b4be4b0f6b0b8a779bc|title=Corbyn: Tory-DUP deal not in national interest|date=26 June 2017|work=BBC News|access-date=26 June 2017|language=en-GB}}</ref> The outgoing leader of the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]], [[Tim Farron]], also criticised it, saying "The public will not be duped by this shoddy little deal. While our schools are crumbling and our NHS is in crisis, Theresa May chooses to throw cash at ten MPs in a grubby attempt to keep her cabinet squatting in Number 10".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/uk-politics-40403501?ns_mchannel=social&ns_source=twitter&ns_campaign=bbc_live&ns_linkname=5950efabe4b0f6b0b8a77936%26Farron%20attacks%20%27shoddy%27%20Tory-DUP%20deal%26&ns_fee=0#post_5950efabe4b0f6b0b8a77936|title=Farron attacks 'shoddy' Tory-DUP deal|date=26 June 2017|work=BBC News|access-date=26 June 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171205220651/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/uk-politics-40403501?ns_mchannel=social&ns_source=twitter&ns_campaign=bbc_live&ns_linkname=5950efabe4b0f6b0b8a77936%26Farron%20attacks%20%27shoddy%27%20Tory-DUP%20deal%26&ns_fee=0#post_5950efabe4b0f6b0b8a77936|archive-date=2017-12-05|url-status=live|language=en-GB}}</ref>

The funding implications of the deal were criticised by [[First Minister of Wales|Welsh First Minister]] [[Carwyn Jones]], who was quoted as saying it was an "outrageous straight bung to keep a weak prime minister and a faltering government in office" adding that the Prime Minister must have discovered a "magic money tree" to provide £1 billion just for Northern Ireland, and described the deal as essentially "cash for votes". The leader of [[Plaid Cymru]], [[Leanne Wood]], echoed these sentiments, describing the deal as a "bribe". In response, former Conservative Welsh Secretary [[Stephen Crabb]] said the deal was "the cost of doing business" to keep his party in power.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-politics-40406396|title=Tory/DUP deal an outrageous straight bung, Carwyn Jones says|date=26 June 2017|work=BBC News|access-date=26 June 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170626150500/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-politics-40406396|archive-date=2017-06-26|url-status=live|language=en-GB}}</ref>

There was particular criticism that the additional spending in Northern Ireland will not lead to matched additional funding in other parts of the country through the [[Barnett formula]]. Scottish Conservative leader, Ruth Davidson, stated that it was "absurd" to criticise UK government spending in addition to the Barnett in Northern Ireland, when "the exact same thing happens in Scotland".<ref name="bbc.co.uk"/>

===After signing of agreement===

In September 2017, the DUP broke with the Conservatives for the first time since the signing of the agreement in order to back non-binding Labour motions on the issues of university tuition fees and pay for NHS employees. DUP Chief Whip [[Jeffrey Donaldson]] insisted the vote "doesn't threaten the deal", and noted that the party "[reserves] the right to vote on the basis of our own manifesto" in their agreement with the government.<ref>{{cite news|work=[[The Guardian]]|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/sep/13/dup-plans-to-vote-with-labour-on-nhs-pay-and-tuition-fees|title=May suffers humiliation as DUP backs Labour on NHS pay and tuition fees|date=13 September 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170920210410/https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/sep/13/dup-plans-to-vote-with-labour-on-nhs-pay-and-tuition-fees|archive-date=20 September 2017}}</ref>

Later that month, [[Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs|Environment Secretary]] [[Michael Gove]] headlined a fundraising event for the DUP hosted by [[Ian Paisley Jr]].<ref>{{cite news|work=[[The News Letter]]|date=29 September 2017|title=Michael Gove addresses large DUP dinner|url=https://www.newsletter.co.uk/news/michael-gove-addresses-large-dup-dinner-1-8174605}}</ref><ref name="fundraiser"/>

In October 2017, Foster and the DUP MPs held another reception at the Conservative Party conference, which was attended by leading Conservative figures including [[First Secretary of State]] [[Damian Green]], [[Brexit Secretary]] [[David Davis (British politician)|David Davis]], [[Chief Whip]] [[Gavin Williamson]], and [[Chairman of the Conservative Party|party chairman]] [[Patrick McLoughlin]].<ref>{{cite news|date=4 October 2017|title=Tory-DUP deal is 'not temporary' says Nigel Dodds|work=[[BBC News]]|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-41493033|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171014051716/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-41493033|archive-date=14 October 2017}}</ref> This was reciprocated in November, when Damian Green and Conservative Chief Whip [[Julian Smith (politician)|Julian Smith]] attended the DUP's conference, with Smith giving a keynote address.<ref>{{cite news|title=Dublin accused of hijacking talks|work=[[The Times]]|date=25 November 2017|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/dublin-accused-of-hijacking-talks-9q9lwz5tp}}</ref>

During February 2018, former [[Secretary of State for International Development|International Development Secretary]] [[Priti Patel]] also headlined a DUP fundraising event hosted by Paisley, while [[Defence Select Committee]] chair [[Julian Lewis]] addressed a constituency dinner hosted by DUP MP [[Jim Shannon]]. Shannon claimed [[Leader of the House of Commons]] [[Andrea Leadsom]] and [[Minister for Sport and Civil Society|Sports Minister]] [[Tracey Crouch]] had also attended his fundraising events in the past<ref name="fundraiser">{{cite news|work=[[The Times]]|title=Top Tories speak at £1,500‑a‑table Unionist dinners|date=10 March 2018|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/top-tories-speak-at-1-500atable-unionist-dinners-tn3fvb6p2}}</ref>

In September 2018, [[Secretary of State for Defence|Defence Secretary]] [[Gavin Williamson]] attended a DUP fundraising dinner hosted by Foster.<ref>{{cite news|work=[[Irish News]]|url=https://www.irishnews.com/news/2018/09/10/news/public-not-informed-about-tory-minister-attendance-at-dup-dinner-in-enniskillen-1428563/|title=Public not told about Tory minister attendance at DUP dinner in Enniskillen}}</ref>

In January 2019, former [[European Research Group]] chair [[Jacob Rees-Mogg]] spoke at a DUP fundraiser at the invitation of Paisley, after declining a similar invitation to fundraise for the [[Northern Ireland Conservatives]].<ref>{{cite news|work=[[Belfast Telegraph]]|title=Jacob Rees-Mogg snubs Tories to appear at DUP fundraiser|date=31 December 2018|url=https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/northern-ireland/jacob-reesmogg-snubs-tories-to-appear-at-dup-fundraiser-37669069.html}}</ref>
