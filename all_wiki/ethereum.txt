'''Ethereum''' is a decentralized [[open-source software|open source]] [[blockchain (database)|blockchain]] featuring [[smart contract]] functionality. '''Ether (ETH)''' is the native [[cryptocurrency]] token of the Ethereum platform.

==History==
[[File:Vitalik Buterin TechCrunch London 2015.jpg|thumb|left|275px|Ethereum founder [[Vitalik Buterin]] in 2015]]

Ethereum was initially described in a white paper by [[Vitalik Buterin]],<ref>{{Cite web |title=White Paper· ethereum/wiki Wiki · GitHub |url=https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/White-Paper |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140111180823/http://ethereum.org/ethereum.html |archive-date=11 January 2014}}</ref> a programmer and co-founder of [[Bitcoin Magazine]], in late 2013 with a goal of building decentralized applications.<ref name="Finley-27-Jan-2014">{{Cite web |last=Finley |first=Klint |date=27 January 2014 |title=Out in the Open: Teenage Hacker Transforms Web into One Giant Bitcoin Network |url=https://www.wired.com/2014/01/ethereum/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160318170702/http://www.wired.com/2014/01/ethereum/ |archive-date=18 March 2016 |access-date=21 March 2016 |website=Wired}}</ref><ref name="Schneider-2014-04-07">{{Cite web |last=Schneider |first=Nathan |date=7 April 2014 |title=Code your own utopia: Meet Ethereum, bitcoin's most ambitious successor |url=http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2014/4/7/code-your-own-utopiameetethereumbitcoinasmostambitioussuccessor.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160223191510/http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2014/4/7/code-your-own-utopiameetethereumbitcoinasmostambitioussuccessor.html |archive-date=23 February 2016 |access-date=21 February 2016 |publisher=Al Jazeera}}</ref> Buterin had argued that Bitcoin needed a [[scripting language]] for application development. After failing to gain agreement, he proposed the development of a new platform with a more general scripting language.<ref name="tapscott2016">{{Cite book |last=Tapscott |first=Don |title=The Blockchain Revolution: How the Technology Behind Bitcoin is Changing Money, Business, and the World |last2=Tapscott |first2=Alex |publisher=Portfolio |year=2016 |isbn=978-0670069972}}</ref>

Ethereum was announced at the North American Bitcoin Conference in [[Miami]], in January 2014.<ref name="Paumgarten" /> During the same time as the conference, a group of people rented a house in Miami: [[Gavin Wood]], [[Charles Hoskinson]], and Anthony Di Iorio, from [[Toronto]], who financed the project.<ref name="Paumgarten" /> Di Iorio invited friend [[Joseph Lubin (entrepreneur)|Joseph Lubin]], who invited reporter Morgen Peck, to bear witness.<ref name="Paumgarten" /> Six months later the founders met again in a house in [[Zug]], [[Switzerland]], where Buterin told the founders that the project would proceed as a non-profit. Hoskinson left the project at that time.<ref name="Paumgarten" />

Ethereum has an unusually long list of founders. Anthony Di Iorio wrote "Ethereum was founded by Vitalik Buterin, Myself, Charles Hoskinson, Mihai Alisie, & Amir Chetrit (the initial 5) in December 2013. Joseph Lubin, Gavin Wood, & Jeffrey Wilke were added in early 2014 as founders." Formal development of the Ethereum software project began in early 2014 through a [[Switzerland|Swiss]] company, [[Ethereum (company)|Ethereum Switzerland GmbH]] (''EthSuisse'').<ref name="bloomberg20160820">{{Cite web |date=20 August 2016 |title=Company Overview of Ethereum Switzerland GmbH |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/Research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=309484729 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160820112644/http://www.bloomberg.com/Research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=309484729 |archive-date=20 August 2016 |access-date=20 August 2016 |publisher=Bloomberg |quote=The company was founded in 2014 and is based in Baar, Switzerland.}}</ref>
The basic idea of putting executable smart contracts in the blockchain needed to be specified before the software could be implemented. This work was done by Gavin Wood, then the [[chief technology officer]], in the ''Ethereum Yellow Paper'' that specified the Ethereum Virtual Machine.<ref name="Dannen">{{Cite book |last=Dannen |first=Chris |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=roVkDgAAQBAJ&pg=PA30 |title=Introducing Ethereum and Solidity: Foundations of Cryptocurrency and Blockchain Programming for Beginners |publisher=Apress |isbn=978-1484225356 |page=30 |access-date=12 November 2018}}</ref>
Subsequently, a Swiss non-profit foundation, the '''Ethereum Foundation''' (''Stiftung Ethereum''), was created as well. Development was funded by an online public [[crowdfunding|crowdsale]] from July to August 2014, with the participants buying the Ethereum value token (ether) with another digital currency, [[Bitcoin]]. While there was early praise for the technical innovations of Ethereum, questions were also raised about its security and scalability.<ref name="Finley-27-Jan-2014" />

In 2019, an Ethereum foundation employee named [[Virgil Griffith]] was arrested by the US government for presenting at a blockchain conference in North Korea.<ref>https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/02/nyregion/north-korea-virgil-griffin-cyptocurrency-arrest.html</ref>

Several codenamed prototypes of the Ethereum platform were developed by the Ethereum Foundation as part of their Proof-of-Concept series. "Olympic" was the last prototype and public beta pre-release. The Olympic network provided users with a [[bug bounty program|bug bounty]] of 25,000 Ether for stress testing the limits of the Ethereum blockchain. In July 2015, "Frontier" marked the tentative experimental release of the Ethereum platform.<ref name="WSJFRONTIER">{{Cite web |last=Vigna |first=Paul |date=31 July 2015 |title=BitBeat: Ethereum Opens Its 'Frontier' for Business |url=https://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2015/07/31/bitbeat-ethereum-opens-its-frontier-for-business/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170906093642/https://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2015/07/31/bitbeat-ethereum-opens-its-frontier-for-business/ |archive-date=6 September 2017 |access-date=5 June 2017 |publisher=The Wall Street Journal}}</ref>

Since the initial launch, Ethereum has undergone several planned protocol upgrades, which are important changes affecting the underlying functionality and/or [[incentive compatibility|incentive structures]] of the platform.<ref name="EFPROCESS">{{Cite web |last=Gupta |first=Vinay |date=3 March 2015 |title=The Ethereum Launch Process |url=https://blog.ethereum.org/2015/03/03/ethereum-launch-process/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170606200002/https://blog.ethereum.org/2015/03/03/ethereum-launch-process/ |archive-date=6 June 2017 |access-date=5 June 2017 |publisher=Ethereum Foundation}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last=Bashir |first=Imran |title=Mastering Blockchain – Third Edition : a deep dive into distributed ledgers, consensus protocols,... smart contracts, dapps, cryptocurrencies, ethereum |date=2020 |publisher=Packt Publishing Limited |isbn=978-1839213199 |location=[S.l.] |pages=312}}</ref> Protocol upgrades are accomplished by means of a [[hard fork]].

[[Open-source]] development is currently underway for a major upgrade to the Ethereum platform, known as Ethereum 2.0, or Eth2.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Dillet |first=Romain |title=Justin Drake from the Ethereum Foundation is coming to Disrupt Berlin |url=https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/22/justin-drake-from-the-ethereum-foundation-is-coming-to-disrupt-berlin/ |access-date=18 August 2020 |website=TechCrunch}}</ref> The main purpose of the upgrade is to increase transaction throughput for the network, from the current of about 15 transactions per second to up to tens of thousands of transactions per second.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Roberts |first=Jeff |title=Ethereum, Bitcoin's closest rival, faces its moment of truth |url=https://fortune.com/2020/02/19/ethereum-bitcoin-closest-rival-cryptocurrency/ |access-date=12 October 2020 |website=Fortune |publisher=Fortune Media IP Limited}}</ref>

The increase in throughput is achieved by splitting up the work load into many blockchains running in parallel and then having them all share a common consensus, so that to maliciously tamper with one chain would require that one tamper with the common consensus, which would cost the attacker far more money than they could ever gain from the attack.

The Ethereum 2.0 upgrade (also known as Serenity) is designed to be launched in three phases:

# "Phase 0" will create the Beacon Chain, a [[proof-of-stake]] blockchain that will act as the central coordination and consensus hub of Eth2.
# "Phase 1" will create [[Shard (database architecture)|shard]] chains and connect them to the Beacon Chain.
# "Phase 2" will implement state execution in the shard chains.<ref>{{Cite web |last=del Castillo |first=Michael |title=Ethereum Cofounder Joe Lubin Talks Trump, Blockchain's 'Frankenstein' And Willingness To Work With China |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaeldelcastillo/2019/11/09/joe-lubin-talks-trump-blockchains-frankenstein-and-willingness-to-work-with-china/#41012c8778bc |access-date=1 June 2020 |website=Forbes |publisher=Forbes}}</ref> The current Ethereum 1.0 chain is expected to become one of the shards of Ethereum 2.0.

As with other cryptocurrencies, the validity of each Ether is provided by a [[blockchain]], which is a continuously growing list of [[Record (computer science)|records]], called ''blocks'', which are linked and secured using [[cryptography|cryptographic]] [[hash function]]s.<ref name="te20151031">{{Cite journal |date=31 October 2015 |title=Blockchains: The great chain of being sure about things |url=https://www.economist.com/news/briefing/21677228-technology-behind-bitcoin-lets-people-who-do-not-know-or-trust-each-other-build-dependable |journal=[[The Economist]] |access-date=18 June 2016 |quote=The technology behind bitcoin lets people who do not know or trust each other build a dependable ledger.

This does not rely upon [[unspent transaction outputs]] (UTXOs). The state denotes the current balances of all accounts and extra data. The state is not stored on the blockchain, it is stored in a separate [[Merkle tree|Merkle]] Patricia tree. A [[cryptocurrency wallet]] stores the [[Public-key cryptography|public and private "keys"]] or "addresses" which can be used to receive or spend ether. These can be generated through BIP 39 style mnemonics for a BIP 32 "HD Wallet". In Ethereum, this is unnecessary as it does not operate in a UTXO scheme. With the private key, it is possible to write in the blockchain, effectively making an Ether transaction.

To send the Ethereum value token Ether to an account, you need the [[SHA-3|Keccak-256]] hash of the public key of that account. Ethereum accounts are pseudonymous in that they are not linked to individual persons, but rather to one or more specific addresses.

===Ether===
''Ether'' is a fundamental token for operation of Ethereum, which thereby provides a public [[distributed ledger]] for transactions. It is used to pay for gas, a unit of network resource used in transactions and other state transitions. Mistakenly, this currency is also referred to as ''Ethereum''.

It is listed under the [[ticker symbol]] ETH and traded on [[cryptocurrency]] exchanges, and the [[Greek alphabet|Greek]] [[Xi (letter)|uppercase Xi]] character (Ξ) is generally used for its [[currency symbol]]. It is also used to pay for transaction fees and computational services on the Ethereum network.<ref name="NYTEVCRB">{{Cite news |last=Popper |first=Nathaniel |date=27 March 2016 |title=Ethereum, a Virtual Currency, Enables Transactions That Rival Bitcoin's |work=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/28/business/dealbook/ethereum-a-virtual-currency-enables-transactions-that-rival-bitcoins.html |url-status=live |access-date=2 September 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160724214904/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/28/business/dealbook/ethereum-a-virtual-currency-enables-transactions-that-rival-bitcoins.html |archive-date=24 July 2016}}</ref>

===Addresses===
Ethereum addresses are composed of the prefix "0x", a common identifier for [[hexadecimal]], concatenated with the rightmost 20 bytes of the [[SHA-3|Keccak-256]] hash ([[Endianness|big endian]]) of the [[Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm|ECDSA]] [[Public-key cryptography|public key]] (the curve used is the so-called ''secp256k1'', the same as [[Bitcoin]]). In hexadecimal, 2 digits represent a byte, meaning addresses contain 40 hexadecimal digits. An example of an Ethereum address is 0xb794f5ea0ba39494ce839613fffba74279579268. Contract addresses are in the same format, however, they are determined by sender and creation transaction nonce.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |last=Wood |first=Gavin |author-link=Gavin Wood |date=3 February 2018 |title=Ethereum: A Secure Decentralized Generalised Transaction Ledger (EIP-150) |url=http://yellowpaper.io |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180203110042/http://yellowpaper.io/ |archive-date=3 February 2018 |access-date=3 February 2018 |website=yellowpaper.io}}</ref> User accounts are indistinguishable from contract accounts given only an address for each and no blockchain data. Any valid Keccak-256 hash put into the described format is valid, even if it does not correspond to an account with a private key or a contract. This is unlike Bitcoin, which uses [[Base58Check|base58check]] to ensure that addresses are properly typed.{{clarify|what does this mean? why does it matter to Ethereum? source?|date=November 2020}}

===Gas===
Gas is a [[unit of account]] within the EVM used in the calculation of a transaction fee, which is the amount of ETH a transaction's sender must pay to the miner who includes the transaction in the blockchain.

Each type of operation which may be performed by the EVM is [[hardcoded]] with a certain gas cost, which is intended to be roughly proportional to the amount of resources ([[computation]] and [[Computer_data_storage|storage]]) a node must expend to perform that operation. When creating a transaction, the sender must specify a ''gas limit'' and ''gas price''. The ''gas limit'' is the maximum amount of gas the sender is willing to use in the transaction, and the ''gas price'' is the amount of ETH the sender wishes to pay per unit of gas used. The higher the ''gas price'', the more incentive a miner has to include the transaction in their block, and thus the quicker the transaction will be included in the blockchain. If a transaction reaches its ''gas limit'' before it finishes executing, the transaction is reverted but the sender still pays for the gas used. Gas prices are typically denominated in Gwei, a subunit of ETH equal to 10<sup>-9</sup> ETH.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=de Azevedo Sousa |first=José Eduardo |date=2020 |title=An analysis of the fees and pending time correlation in Ethereum |url=http://dl.ifip.org/db/conf/lanoms/lanoms2019/196411_1.pdf |journal=International Journal of Network Management |issue=e2113 |access-date=14 October 2020}}</ref>

This fee mechanism is designed to mitigate transaction [[Spamming|spam]], prevent [[infinite loops]] during contract execution, and provide for a [[Market_(economics)|market]]-based allocation of network resources.

===Comparison to bitcoin===
Ethereum is different from [[Bitcoin]] (the [[cryptocurrency]] with the largest [[market capitalization]] as of October 2020) in several aspects:<ref>{{Cite web |last=Popper |first=Nathaniel |date=1 October 2017 |title=Understanding Ethereum, Bitcoin's Virtual Cousin (Published 2017) |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/01/technology/what-is-ethereum.html |website=The New York Times}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Johnson |first=Steven |date=16 January 2018 |title=Beyond the Bitcoin Bubble (Published 2018) |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/16/magazine/beyond-the-bitcoin-bubble.html |website=The New York Times}}</ref>
* Bitcoin is a singular form of digital money where users can send, receive and hold only bitcoins. Ethereum is a smart contract platform which allows entities to leverage blockchain technology to create numerous different digital ledgers and can be used to create additional cryptocurrencies that run on top of its blockchain. For example, Ethereum can be used to create tokens that are pegged 1:1 with the value of the [[United States dollar]] (called a [[Stablecoin]]) if a user wanted to transfer or hold the value of dollars on the blockchain. Ether itself can also be sent, received and held as digital money.
* Bitcoin is aimed to only be money, compared with Ethereum where a goal is to also run applications (like the [[Google Play]] or [[App Store (iOS/iPadOS)|Apple App store]]).
* Its [[Blockchain#Block time|block time]] is 13 seconds, compared with 10 minutes for bitcoin.
* [[Mining (cryptocurrency)|Mining]] of Ether generates new coins at a usually consistent rate, occasionally changing during hard forks, while for bitcoin the rate halves every 4 years.
* For proof-of-work, it uses the [[Ethash]] algorithm which reduces the advantage of specialized [[ASIC]]s in mining.
* Transaction fees differ by computational complexity, bandwidth use and storage needs (in a system known as gas), while bitcoin transactions compete by means of transaction size, in bytes.
* Ethereum uses an accounting system where values in Wei (the smallest denomination of 1 Ether, 1 ETH = 10<sup>18</sup> Wei) are debited from accounts and credited to another, as opposed to Bitcoin's UTXO system, which is more analogous to spending cash and receiving change in return.

===Supply===
The total supply of Ether was around Ξ110.5 million as of 16 April 2020. In 2017, mining generated 9.2 million new ether, corresponding to a 10% increase in its total supply. The shift to Ethereum 2.0 may curb the total supply of Ether.<ref>{{Cite web |date=25 November 2020 |title=Ethereum Upgrade Adds to Crypto Mania Sparked by Bitcoin’s Surge |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-25/ethereum-upgrade-adds-to-crypto-mania-sparked-by-bitcoin-s-surge |website=Bloomberg.com |language=en}}</ref> There is no currently implemented hard cap on the total supply of ETH.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Varshney |first=Neer |date=11 June 2018 |title=Ethereum's supply has crossed 100M, here's what that means |url=https://thenextweb.com/hardfork/2018/06/11/ethereums-total-supply/ |access-date=25 May 2019 |website=Hard Fork {{!}} The Next Web |language=en-us}}</ref>

=== Difficulty Bomb and The Ice Age ===

The Ethereum Difficulty Bomb refers to a mechanism where the difficulty of blockchain mining began increasing in November 2016, from block 200,000. The onset of the Difficulty Bomb is referred to as Ethereum's Ice Age. The Ice Age was implemented in order to serve as an incentive for the Ethereum network to transition to the Proof of Stake (PoS) blockchain once ready from the Proof of Work (PoW) blockchain. A difficulty bomb was scheduled in February 2019 but was pushed back by developers.<ref name="Olga2019Bomb">{{Cite news |last=Kharif |first=Olga |date=18 January 2019 |title=Ethereum's Split Pushed Back Until After Valentine's Day |publisher=Bloomberg |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-01-18/cryptocurrency-ethereum-s-network-update-pushed-back-to-february |access-date=16 February 2020}}</ref>

===Markets and stores===
Ether can be purchased and sold through regular currency [[brokers]], [[cryptocurrency exchanges]], [[PayPal]]<ref>{{Cite web |last=Irrera |first=Anna |title=PayPal to allow cryptocurrency buying, selling and shopping on its network |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/paypal-cryptocurrency/paypal-to-allow-cryptocurrency-buying-selling-and-shopping-on-its-network-idUSL1N2HB14U |access-date=22 October 2020 |website=Reuters}}</ref> and many online [[cryptocurrency wallet]]s.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Olga Kharif |date=11 October 2017 |title=Fans of Digital Currency Ether Can Now Buy ETNs&nbsp;In Sweden |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-10-11/fans-of-digital-currency-ether-can-now-buy-etns-in-sweden |website=[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]]}}</ref>

== Platform ==

=== Virtual Machine ===
The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is the runtime environment for smart contracts in Ethereum. It is a 256-bit register stack, designed to run the same code exactly as intended. It is the fundamental consensus mechanism for Ethereum. The formal definition of the EVM is specified in the Ethereum Yellow Paper.<ref name=":0" /><ref name="DEBA20">{{Cite report |title=Developing an Ethereum Blockchain Application |last=Triantafyllidis |first=Nikolaos Petros |date=19 February 2016 |publisher=University of Amsterdam |page=20 |chapter=The Ethereum Project: Ethereum History}}</ref> Ethereum Virtual Machines have been implemented in [[C++]], [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]], [[Go (programming language)|Go]], [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[JavaScript]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]], [[Rust (programming language)|Rust]], [[Elixir (programming language)|Elixir]], [[Erlang (programming language)|Erlang]], and soon, [[WebAssembly]] (currently under development).

===Smart contracts===
Ethereum's [[smart contract]]s are based on different computer languages, which developers use to program their own functionalities. Smart contracts are [[High-level programming language|high-level]] programming [[Abstraction (software engineering)|abstractions]] that are compiled down to EVM [[bytecode]] and deployed to the Ethereum blockchain for execution. They can be written in [[Solidity]] (a language library with similarities to [[C (programming language)|C]] and [[JavaScript]]), Serpent (similar to [[Python (programming language)|Python]], but deprecated), Yul (an intermediate language that can compile to various different backends&nbsp;– EVM 1.0, EVM 1.5 and eWASM are planned), LLL (a [[Low-level programming language|low-level]] [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]]-like language), and Mutan ([[Go (programming language)|Go]]-based, but deprecated). There is also a research-oriented language under development called Vyper (a [[Strong and weak typing|strongly-typed]] [[Python (programming language)|Python]]-derived [[Recursive language|decidable language]]).

Smart contracts can be public, which opens up the possibility to prove functionality, e.g. self-contained [[provably fair]] casinos.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Piasecki |first=Piotr J. |year=2016 |title=Gaming Self-Contained Provably Fair Smart Contract Casinos |url=http://www.ledgerjournal.org/ojs/index.php/ledger/article/view/29 |url-status=live |journal=[[Ledger (journal)|Ledger]] |volume=1 |pages=99–110 |doi=10.5195/ledger.2016.29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161224031048/http://www.ledgerjournal.org/ojs/index.php/ledger/article/view/29 |archive-date=24 December 2016 |doi-access=free}}</ref>

One issue related to using smart contracts on a public blockchain is that bugs, including security holes, are visible to all but cannot be fixed quickly.<ref name="Peck20160528">{{Cite web |last=Peck |first=M. |date=28 May 2016 |title=Ethereum's $150-Million Blockchain-Powered Fund Opens Just as Researchers Call For a Halt |url=https://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-talk/computing/networks/ethereums-150-million-dollar-dao-opens-for-business-just-as-researchers-call-for-a-moratorium |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160530202345/https://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-talk/computing/networks/ethereums-150-million-dollar-dao-opens-for-business-just-as-researchers-call-for-a-moratorium |archive-date=30 May 2016 |website=[[IEEE Spectrum]] |publisher=[[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]]}}</ref> One example of this is the 17 June 2016 attack on The DAO, which could not be quickly stopped or reversed.<ref name="NYTDAOHACK" />

There is ongoing research on how to use formal verification to express and prove non-trivial properties. A [[Microsoft Research]] report noted that writing solid smart contracts can be extremely difficult in practice, using The DAO hack to illustrate this problem. The report discussed tools that Microsoft had developed for verifying contracts, and noted that a large-scale analysis of published contracts is likely to uncover widespread vulnerabilities. The report also stated that it is possible to verify the equivalence of a Solidity program and the EVM code.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Short Paper: Formal Verification of Smart Contracts |url=http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/nswamy/papers/solidether.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160827092146/http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/nswamy/papers/solidether.pdf |archive-date=27 August 2016 |access-date=25 August 2016 |website=microsoft.com/ |publisher=Microsoft}}</ref>

=== Performance ===
In Ethereum all smart contracts are stored publicly on every node of the blockchain, which has costs. Being a [[blockchain]] means it is&nbsp;[[secure by design]]{{clarify|date=February 2020}}&nbsp;and is an example of a distributed computing system with high&nbsp;[[Byzantine fault tolerance]]. The downside is that performance issues arise in that every node is calculating all the smart contracts in real time, resulting in lower speeds. As of January 2016, the Ethereum protocol could process about 25 transactions per second. In comparison, the [[Visa Inc.|Visa]] payment platform processes 45,000 payments per second leading some to question the scalability of Ethereum.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Murphy |first=Hannah |date=19 October 2018 |title=The rise and fall of Ethereum |language=en |work=Financial Times |publisher=The Financial Times Ltd |location=London |url=https://www.ft.com/content/a8d2c280-d2b6-11e8-a9f2-7574db66bcd5 |access-date=19 October 2018}}</ref> On 19 December 2016, Ethereum exceeded one million transactions in a single day for the first time.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Filiba |first=Jack |title=Ethereum Breaks One Million Transactions in a Single Day |url=https://discover.coinsquare.io/tech/ethereum-one-million-transaction-day/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171222052607/https://discover.coinsquare.io/tech/ethereum-one-million-transaction-day/ |archive-date=22 December 2017}}</ref>

==Etymology==
Vitalik Buterin picked the name Ethereum after browsing [[Wikipedia]] articles about elements and science fiction, when he found the name, noting, "I immediately realized that I liked it better than all of the other alternatives that I had seen; I suppose it was the fact that [it] sounded nice and it had the word '[[Luminiferous aether|ether]]', referring to the hypothetical invisible medium that permeates the universe and allows light to travel."<ref name="Paumgarten" />

==Criticisms==
Izabella Kaminska, the editor of [[FT Alphaville]], pointed out in 2017 that criminals were using Ethereum to run [[Ponzi scheme]]s and other forms of investment fraud.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Kaminska |first=Izabella |date=1 June 2017 |title=It's not a ponzi, it's a smart ponzi |publisher=[[FT Alphaville]] |url=https://ftalphaville.ft.com/2017/06/01/2189634/its-not-just-a-ponzi-its-a-smart-ponzi/ |url-status=live |url-access=registration |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170723014343/https://ftalphaville.ft.com/2017/06/01/2189634/its-not-just-a-ponzi-its-a-smart-ponzi/ |archive-date=23 July 2017}}</ref> The article was based on a paper from the [[University of Cagliari]], which placed the number of Ethereum smart contracts which facilitate Ponzi schemes at nearly 10% of 1384 smart contracts examined. However, it also estimated that only 0.05% of the transactions on the network were related to such contracts.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Bartoletti |first=Massimo |last2=Carta |first2=Salvatore |last3=Cimoli |first3=Tiziana |last4=Saia |first4=Roberto |date=January 2020 |title=Dissecting Ponzi schemes on Ethereum: identification, analysis, and impact |journal=Future Generation Computer Systems |volume=102 |pages=259–277 |arxiv=1703.03779 |bibcode=2017arXiv170303779B |doi=10.1016/j.future.2019.08.014 |s2cid=8749672}}</ref>
