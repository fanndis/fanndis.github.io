==Early life==
Eric Jack Pickles was born on 20 April 1952, the son of Jack and Constance Pickles.<ref>''Dod's Parliamentary Companion'', 2010, p. 290</ref> Born in [[Keighley]], [[West Riding of Yorkshire]], he attended Greenhead Grammar School (now [[University Academy Keighley]]) and then studied at [[Leeds Metropolitan University|Leeds Polytechnic]]. He was born into a [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]]-supporting family – his great grandfather was one of the founders of the [[Independent Labour Party]], and Pickles described himself as "massively inclined" towards communism as a boy.<ref name="Eric Pickles tells of communist past as Eric the Red">{{cite news |first=Robert |last=Watts |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article6926960.ece |title=Eric Pickles tells of communist past as Eric the Red |accessdate=22 November 2009 |date=22 November 2009 |work=The Times |location=London |url-access=subscription |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430104634/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article6926960.ece |archive-date=30 April 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref>

==Young Conservatives==
After the [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia|Soviet Union invaded Czechoslovakia]], he joined the local Keighley Branch of the Young Conservatives in 1968, later commenting "I joined because of the invasion of Czechoslovakia. I was so shocked by the tanks. It was not the best way of fighting Brezhnev, but it made me feel better".<ref>{{cite book  |last=Grogan |first=Tony |title=The Pickles Papers |chapter-url=http://www.1in12.com/publications/archive/thepicklespapers/pickleschap2.html |chapter= Chapter 2: Man of Mystery (Paragraph 15)|location=Bradford |publisher=1 in 12 Publications |year=1989 |isbn=0-948994-04-5 }} [http://www.1in12.com/publications/archive/thepicklespapers/picklesintro.html (free electronic edition, October 1996)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150711032852/http://www.1in12.com/publications/archive/thepicklespapers/picklesintro.html |date=11 July 2015 }}</ref><ref name="Bluff diamond">{{cite news

Pickles soon became the chairman of the local [[Young Conservatives (UK)|Young Conservatives]] association.<ref name="Bluff diamond"/> During his time in the Young Conservatives he became a member of the Joint Committee Against Racism from 1982 to 1987 and later became its Chairman.<ref>Dod's Parliamentary Companion 2005, 173 edition, London 2004, p.275</ref>

==Bradford councillor==
Pickles was first elected to [[City of Bradford|Bradford Council]] in 1979, representing the Worth Valley ward.<ref name="Bluff diamond"/> From 1982 to 1984, he chaired that Council's Social Services Committee, and then, from 1984 to 1986, he chaired the Education Committee.<ref>[http://www.debretts.com/people-of-today/profile/18495 Profile] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150413065420/http://www.debretts.com/people-of-today/profile/18495 |date=13 April 2015 }}, Debretts.com; accessed 16 July 2014.</ref> Between 1988 and 1990, he served as leader of the Conservative group on the council. In September 1988 the Conservative Party gained control by using the Conservative mayor's casting vote to become the only inner-city council to be controlled by the Conservatives.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

When Bradford Council was hung, Pickles opted to break the agreement that the position of Lord Mayor is rotated between the parties, when he put a Conservative mayor in place again.<ref name="independent 24 January 2009">{{cite news|last=Vallely|first=Paul|title=Eric Pickles: The Tory heavyweight|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/eric-pickles-the-tory-heavyweight-1514541.html|accessdate=6 July 2010|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|date=24 January 2009|location=London|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091008132450/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/eric-pickles-the-tory-heavyweight-1514541.html|archive-date=8 October 2009|url-status=live}}</ref> This effectively gave the Conservatives a majority due to the Lord Mayor's casting vote. To do this, they also broke the tradition that the Lord Mayor kept the status quo.

Whilst at Bradford, Pickles announced a five-year plan to cut the council's budget by £50m, reduce the workforce by a third, privatise services and undertake council departmental restructures, many of which proved controversial.<ref name="independent 24 January 2009"/> A book, ''The Pickles Papers'', by Tony Grogan, was written about this period in Pickles' life.<ref>Grogan, Tony.

==Parliamentary career==
Pickles was Member of Parliament for [[Brentwood and Ongar (UK Parliament constituency)|Brentwood and Ongar]] 1992 until standing down in 2017. He was the [[Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government]] in the coalition government headed by Prime Minister [[David Cameron]] until May 2015, following his appointment to the role on 12 May 2010. Previously he had served as [[Chairman of the Conservative Party]] from January 2009 to May 2010 and Shadow [[Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government]], having held that post since June 2007. Prior to this he served as Shadow Minister for [[Department of Communities and Local Government|Local Government]] from June 2002. Before that Pickles was Shadow [[Secretary of State for Transport|Minister for Transport]] (September 2001 – June 2002) and Shadow [[Minister for London]].

At the [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001 general election]], the independent candidate [[Martin Bell]], who was the MP for [[Tatton (UK Parliament constituency)|Tatton]], having run a campaign of "anti-sleaze", stood against Pickles due to accusations that the [[Peniel Pentecostal Church]] had infiltrated the local Conservative branch.<ref name=Beeb>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/world_at_one/programme_highlights/1061583.stm|title=Martin Bell to run for MP again|work=BBC News|date=8 December 2000|accessdate=14 August 2012}}</ref> Pickles's vote was reduced from 45.4% to 38%, but he retained his seat by a margin of 2,821 votes (6.5%) becoming elected with 38% of the votes against Martin Bell's 31.5%.

At the [[2005 United Kingdom general election|2005 general election]] Pickles retained the seat with an increased majority of 11,612 (26.3%), nearly as many as the total votes cast for the second-place candidate, and making this the second-safest seat in Eastern England, and Pickles the MP with the third-highest share of the vote cast<ref>House of Commons Research Paper 05/33 – The General Election 2005</ref> in this region. Pickles polled a total of 23,609 votes (53.5%).

On 2 July 2007 David Cameron appointed Pickles to a reshuffled [[Official Opposition Shadow Cabinet (United Kingdom)|Shadow Cabinet]] as Shadow Communities and Local Government Secretary. On 30 December 2008, according to reports in ''The Times'', Pickles unveiled plans to "purge town hall 'fat cats'". ''The Times'' reported that under the plans "dozens of council chiefs who earn more than Cabinet ministers would lose their jobs as clusters of councils merged their frontline services and backroom operations to provide better value for money."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article5416096.ece|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090130040429/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article5416096.ece|url-status=dead|archive-date=30 January 2009|title=Tories plan purge of town hall ‘fat cats’ - Times Online|date=30 January 2009}}</ref> Of the eight highest earning chief executives listed in ''The Times''' report, six were employed by councils run by the Conservative party, one by Labour and one by the Liberal Democrats.

Pickles was the campaign manager for the successful [[2008 Crewe and Nantwich by-election|Crewe and Nantwich by-election]] in May 2008. Following this, Pickles was promoted to Chairman of the Conservative Party in January 2009.

In early 2010, Pickles defended the [[Plurality voting system|first-past-the-post]] voting system as resulting in stable government. He attacked Prime Minister [[Gordon Brown]] saying he "now wants to fiddle the electoral system" by wanting to change the voting system.<ref>{{cite news|title=Gordon Brown outlines plans to reform UK voting system|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/8492622.stm|accessdate=22 April 2013|work=BBC News|date=2 February 2010}}</ref>

In his role as Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, on 30 July 2010, Pickles announced plans to hand powers where ministers can cap what they deem to be unreasonable increases in council taxes to local people. A consultation began in August 2010 and the powers, which will require legislation, should be in force by March 2012.{{Update inline|date=August 2014}} Pickles said he was determined to reverse the presumption that Whitehall knows best by making local councils directly accountable to the local taxpayer. He said: "If councils want to increase council tax further, they will have to prove the case to the electorate. Let the people decide". Residents would be asked to choose between accepting the rise or rejecting it and instead accepting a below inflation rise, but with reduced council services. The average council tax on a Band D property increased from £688 a year in 1997/98 to £1,439 for 2010.<ref>{{cite news |last=Hope |first=Christopher |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/7917021/Local-people-to-get-powers-to-veto-excessive-council-tax-rises-Eric-Pickles-to-say-today.html |title=Local people to get powers to veto excessive council tax rises, Eric Pickles to say today |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=30 July 2010 |accessdate=4 October 2010 |location=London |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110310105524/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/7917021/Local-people-to-get-powers-to-veto-excessive-council-tax-rises-Eric-Pickles-to-say-today.html |archive-date=10 March 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Pickles is a figure who does not shun controversy. In ''[[The Observer]]'', [[Will Hutton]] appraised his role with regard to local government as follows: "Local government minister Eric Pickles has colluded cheerfully with George Osborne to knock local government back to being no more than rat catchers and managers of street lighting.

In December 2014, asked in Parliament if people who left their wheelie bins in the street after a collection should be punished, he said they should be [[Judicial corporal punishment|flogged]] -though he also said flogging was too good for them and that leaving the bin in the middle of the road was poor behaviour.<ref name=chris>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/11297687/Flog-home-owners-who-leave-bins-in-road-says-Eric-Pickles.html |title='Flog' home owners who leave bins in road, says Eric Pickles |first=Christopher |last=Hope |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date=16 December 2014 |accessdate=17 December 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141217003737/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/11297687/Flog-home-owners-who-leave-bins-in-road-says-Eric-Pickles.html |archive-date=17 December 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref>

The [[Rotherham child sexual exploitation scandal]] was unearthed during Pickles' tenure, and in February 2015 he announced a strategy to implement commissioners at [[Rotherham Council]] in the wake of the [[Casey Report]], which had been commissioned in 2014 to investigate child sex abuse in Rotherham. Seven councillors resigned as a result of the damning report, which revealed that the local authority was "wholly dysfunctional" and that the failure to protect 1,400 girls from sexual abuse was a result of "complacency, institutionalised political correctness" and "blatant failures of political and officer leadership".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/report-of-inspection-of-rotherham-metropolitan-borough-council|title=Report of inspection of Rotherham metropolitan borough council – GOV.UK|website=www.gov.uk|access-date=5 February 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150205000019/https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/report-of-inspection-of-rotherham-metropolitan-borough-council|archive-date=5 February 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Localism Act===
[[File:Eric Pickles, October 2009 3.jpg|thumb|left|Pickles in 2009]]
Pickles was responsible for the [[Localism Act 2011]] that changed the powers of [[local government in England]]. The measures affected by the Act include more [[directly elected mayors in the United Kingdom|elected mayors]] and [[referendum]]s. The Localism Act opens with Part 1, Chapter 1(1), under the heading "Local authority's general power of competence", [[everything which is not forbidden is allowed|"A local council has power to do anything that individuals generally may do"]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2011/20/section/1/enacted |title=Localism Act 2011 |first=Eric |last=Pickles |date=13 December 2010 |access-date=9 April 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120625021436/http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2011/20/section/1/enacted |archive-date=25 June 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref>

The bill was introduced by Pickles, and given its [[first reading]] on 13 December 2010. The Bill completed the third reading in the House of Lords on 31 October 2011.<ref name=LB>{{cite web |url=http://services.parliament.uk/bills/2010-11/localism.html |title=Localism Bill 2010–11 |publisher=UK Parliament |access-date=9 February 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101216012024/http://services.parliament.uk/bills/2010-11/localism.html |archive-date=16 December 2010 |url-status=live }}</ref> The bill received [[Royal Assent]] on 15 November 2011.

The bill was quickly undermined, however, after it was published on 13 December. One of the claims made for it is that it would "give local communities real control over housing and planning decisions", but on the same day, Pickles issued a decision in a planning appeal. The National Grid had applied to Tewkesbury Borough Council to build a gas plant just outside Tirley in [[Gloucestershire]]. The installation would occupy more than 16 acres and the application had been opposed by more than 1,000 residents in a sparsely populated rural area, by 12 parish councils and by every member of the planning committee of the local planning authority. Rejecting the local opposition, Pickles chose to grant permission to build the gas plant.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/planning-callins/pdf/1795566.pdf |title=Tirley PRI Secretaries of State decision letter |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110106020824/http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/planning-callins/pdf/1795566.pdf |archivedate=6 January 2011 |df=dmy }}</ref>

In April 2014, [[South Norfolk (UK Parliament constituency)|South Norfolk MP]] [[Richard Bacon (politician)|Richard Bacon]] welcomed the decision that Pickles and the [[Department for Communities and Local Government|DCLG]] would have final say over the building of wind turbines.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dissmercury.co.uk/news/south_norfolk_mp_richard_bacon_welcomes_turbine_decision_1_3560162|title=South Norfolk MP Richard Bacon welcomes turbine decision|last=Bareham|first=Dominic|date=15 April 2014|work=[[Diss Mercury]]|accessdate=15 December 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141215233019/http://www.dissmercury.co.uk/news/south_norfolk_mp_richard_bacon_welcomes_turbine_decision_1_3560162|archive-date=15 December 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> By June 2014, Pickles had intervened on 12 windfarm projects and rejected 10 of them, against the recommendations from planning inspectors,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blueandgreentomorrow.com/2014/06/06/eric-pickles-rejects-10-out-of-12-wind-farm-applications/ |publisher=Blue and Green Tomorrow |title=Eric Pickles rejects 10 out of 12 wind farm applications |date=6 June 2014 |first=Charlotte |last=Malone |accessdate=28 October 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141009005307/http://blueandgreentomorrow.com/2014/06/06/eric-pickles-rejects-10-out-of-12-wind-farm-applications/ |archive-date=9 October 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref> rising to 50 rejections by October 2014.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/oct/28/war-on-windfarms-tories-latest-sop-to-ukip |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |title=This war on windfarms is the Tories' latest sop to Ukip |first=Polly |last=Toynbee |date=28 October 2014 |accessdate=28 October 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141028155431/http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/oct/28/war-on-windfarms-tories-latest-sop-to-ukip |archive-date=28 October 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Council prayers===
On 10 February 2012, the [[National Secular Society]] obtained a [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] judicial review of the Christian prayers held during meetings in council chambers, which non-Christian councillors were forced to attend as prayers formed part of the formal agenda and councillors are obliged to attend for the duration of the formal agenda.
Mr Justice Ouseley ruled: "The saying of prayers as part of the formal meeting of a Council is not lawful under s111 of the [[Local Government Act 1972]], and there is no statutory power permitting the practice to continue. I do not think the 1972 Act should be interpreted as permitting the religious views of one group of councillors, however sincere or large in number, to exclude, or even to a modest extent, to impose burdens on or even to mark out those who do not share their views and do not wish to participate in their expression of them. They are all equally elected councillors".<ref>{{cite web|title=High Court Ruling on Council Prayers|url=http://www.secularism.org.uk/news/2012/02/council-prayers-unlawful-rules-high-court|publisher=National Secular Society|accessdate=20 February 2012|date=10 February 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120214150530/http://www.secularism.org.uk/news/2012/02/council-prayers-unlawful-rules-high-court|archive-date=14 February 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>

Although Mr Justice Ouseley said prayers were permitted to be held before the start of the formal agenda, Eric Pickles vowed to reverse the High Court decision, despite a recent [[Yougov]] poll showing 55% were against councils holding prayers with just 26% in favour.<ref>{{cite web|title=Yougov poll on Council Prayers|url=http://www.secularism.org.uk/news/2012/02/poll-shows-majority-think-councils-shouldnt-pray|publisher=National Secular Society|accessdate=20 February 2012|date=19 February 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120222225020/http://www.secularism.org.uk/news/2012/02/poll-shows-majority-think-councils-shouldnt-pray|archive-date=22 February 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> Eric Pickles brought forward his Localism Act, due to become law in April 2012, and made it law on 17 February 2012 claiming he is 'effectively reversing' the High Court decision.<ref>{{cite news |title= Councils win prayer 'rights' as Localism Act powers fast tracked, ministers say |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-17082136 |work= BBC News |accessdate= 20 February 2012 |date= 18 February 2012 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120219013431/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-17082136 |archive-date= 19 February 2012 |url-status= live }}</ref>

Keith Porteous Wood, Executive Director of the National Secular Society, commented "A number of senior lawyers have expressed doubt whether the Localism Act will, as Mr Pickles hopes, make prayers lawful, and the Act was clearly not passed with that express intention. His powers to pass legislation are not, as he implies, untrammelled. Council prayers increasingly look set to become a battle between the Government and the courts at ever higher levels".<ref>{{cite web|title=Keith Porteous Wood|url=http://www.secularism.org.uk/news/2012/02/council-prayers--doubts-over-eric-pickles-general-power-of-competence|publisher=National Secular Society|accessdate=20 February 2012|date=18 February 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120221010636/http://www.secularism.org.uk/news/2012/02/council-prayers--doubts-over-eric-pickles-general-power-of-competence|archive-date=21 February 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> The Localism Act permits local government councils to do anything that is not forbidden.

===Troubled Families===
Pickles led the [[Troubled Families]] Programme designed to turn around 120,000&nbsp;dysfunctional families responsible, at a cost of around £400&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-37010486|title=Troubled Families report 'suppressed'|date=8 August 2016|first=Chris|last=Cook|website=BBC News|accessdate=12 August 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160811193655/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-37010486|archive-date=11 August 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> According to David Cameron, these families were responsible for 'a large proportion of the problems in society'. The families were selected for having 5 of 7 measures of social and economic deprivation. Pickles claimed repeatedly that these families cost the state £9&nbsp;billion per annum. In March 2015 Pickles declared the programme a 'triumph' in the House of Commons after it allegedly 'turned around' 105,600&nbsp;families of 117,910&nbsp;processed and saved £1.2&nbsp;billion per annum. £1.2 billion per annum was a hypothetical number based on assumptions that alleged improvements in behaviour would be sustained and depended on removing the high costs associated with disabled children and chronically sick, unemployed adults.<ref>Troubled Families, Green Man Books, 2015.{{ISBN|978-1514170588}}</ref>

The Evaluation by the [[National Institute for Economic and Social Research]] was published on 17 October 2016.  The report found that there had been "no significant impact" of the scheme.<ref name="niesr.ac.uk">{{cite web|url=http://www.niesr.ac.uk/publications/national-evaluation-troubled-families-programme-final-synthesis-report|title=National Evaluation of the Troubled Families Programme – Final Synthesis Report|date=2016-10-17|last1=Portes|first1= J.|last2= Bewley|first2= H.}}</ref> A press release from NIESR stated, "we were unable to find consistent evidence that the programme had any significant or systematic impact".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.niesr.ac.uk/media/niesr-press-release-%E2%80%93-no-evidence-troubled-families-programme-had-any-significant-impact-key|title=NIESR Press Release – No evidence Troubled Families Programme had any significant impact on key objectives, NIESR evaluation finds|date=17 October 2016|website=National Institute of Economic and Social Research}}</ref> The Times reported the following day, "the report was published quietly last night after complaints from Whitehall insiders that it was being suppressed".<ref>{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename= Cameron 'wasted £1bn on troubled families'|author=Oliver Wright and Michael Savage |day_of_week=Tuesday |date=17 October 2016|page_numbers=1–2}}</ref>

The [[Public Accounts Committee]] published its report on 19 December 2016.  They concluded that the delay in publication had been unacceptable, that DCLG had failed to demonstrate that the programme had any significant impact and that the terminology of saying that the families had been "turned around" was misleading given that many of the families had continuing problems after a result had been claimed.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201617/cmselect/cmpubacc/711/71102.htm|title=House of Commons – Troubled families: progress review – Committee of Public Accounts|website=publications.parliament.uk}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/dec/20/troubled-families-government-misled-public-99-success-claim-say-mps?CMP=share_btn_link|date=19 December 2016|access-date=21 December 2016|title=Government misled public with 99% success rate claim on troubled families, say MPs|newspaper=The Guardian|location=UK}}</ref>  The PAC chairwoman, [[Meg Hillier]], commented that the report was "far more serious" than "a slap on the wrist" for ministers.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-38369557?ocid=socialflow_twitter&ns_mchannel=social&ns_campaign=bbcnews&ns_source=twitter|date=20 December 2016|access-date=21 December 2016|title=Troubled families turnaround claim misleading, say MPs|newspaper=BBC News|location=UK}}</ref>

===Flooding of the Somerset Levels===

From December 2013 onwards the [[Somerset Levels]] suffered severe flooding as part of the wider [[2013-2014 Atlantic winter storms in Europe]] and subsequent [[2013–2014 United Kingdom winter floods]]. 

There were public calls for the rivers Parrett and Tone, in particular, to be dredged. The Environment Agency was blamed for not having dredged the major river channels of the Levels. The Environment Agency and others pointed out that it would be more effective to spend money on delaying floodwaters upstream, and that increasing the capacity of rivers by dredging would be of no significant use; the Environment Secretary defended the Agency.<ref>{{cite news|title = UK floods: Cameron gives lukewarm backing to Environment Agency boss|url = https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/feb/10/david-cameron-environment-agency-lord-smith|accessdate = 10 February 2014|newspaper = The Guardian|date = 10 February 2014|first= Rowena|last= Mason|first2 = Patrick |last2=Wintour}}</ref> [https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/people/view/364367-falconer-roger Roger Falconer], Professor of Water Management at Cardiff University, and other hydrologists made clear that dredging did not offer a useful solution to flooding on the Somerset Levels.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sciencemediacentre.org/expert-reaction-to-somerset-flooding/|title=expert reaction to Somerset flooding &#124; Science Media Centre}}</ref>

==Second home==
On 26 March 2009, Pickles appeared on the political debate programme ''[[Question Time (TV series)|Question Time]]'' in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]]. While discussing the controversy over [[Tony McNulty]] (who had recently admitted claiming expenses on a second home, occupied by his parents, only 8 miles away from his primary residence), Pickles admitted he claimed a second home allowance because he lived 37 miles from [[Palace of Westminster|Westminster]] and needed to leave his constituency house in Brentwood at 5.30&nbsp;am to get to Westminster for 9.30&nbsp;am,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/question_time/7967561.stm |title=MP: Long hours justify second home claim BBC 26 March 2009 |work=BBC News |date=27 March 2009 |accessdate=4 October 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090330023147/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/question_time/7967561.stm |archive-date=30 March 2009 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Martin |first=Iain |url=http://blogs.uat.telegraph.co.uk/news/iainmartin/9307837/Tories_should_put_Eric_Pickles_under_house_arrest/ |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120708031527/http://blogs.uat.telegraph.co.uk/news/iainmartin/9307837/Tories_should_put_Eric_Pickles_under_house_arrest/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=8 July 2012 |title=Tories should put Eric Pickles under house arrest |work=Daily Telegraph |date=27 March 2009 |accessdate=4 October 2010 |location=London }}</ref> given that he tended to get home at midnight or 1&nbsp;am, although the standard time for commuters from this region is usually ninety minutes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.juryteam.org/blog/?p=219 |title=Eric Pickles on Question Time – 1:35 on the video, 21 March 2009 |publisher=Juryteam.org |date=21 March 2009 |accessdate=4 October 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100414152137/http://www.juryteam.org/blog/?p=219 |archivedate=14 April 2010 |df=dmy }}</ref> He went on to say that it was "no fun" commuting into London from where he lived. In response to Pickles's comments that he "had to be there [the House of Commons] on time", ''Question Time'' host [[David Dimbleby]], replied "Like a job, in other words?" and fellow panellist [[Caroline Lucas]] added 'welcome to the real world', both of which prompted amusement and applause amongst the audience.

Pickles was asked to pay back £300 following the MP's expenses scandal, which he had claimed for cleaning.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/oct/16/mps-expenses-list-who-owes | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=MPs' expenses: Who is in the clear, and who owes what | first=Allegra | last=Stratton | date=16 October 2009 | accessdate=2 May 2010 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181011121059/https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/oct/16/mps-expenses-list-who-owes | archive-date=11 October 2018 | url-status=live }}</ref>
