The '''Constitution of Australia''' (or '''Australian Constitution''') is a [[written constitution]] that is the [[Constitution|supreme law]] of [[Australia]].  It establishes Australia as a [[Federation of Australia|federation]] under a [[constitutional monarchy]] and outlines the structure and powers of the federal [[Government of Australia|executive government]], [[Parliament of Australia|legislature]] and [[Judiciary of Australia|judiciary]].

The constitution was drafted between 1891 and 1898, through a series of [[Constitutional Convention (Australia)|conventions]] conducted by representatives of the six self-governing British colonies in Australia. The final draft was then approved in a [[1898–1900 Australian constitutional referendums|set of referendums]] from 1898 to 1900. The British government objected to some elements of the final draft, but a slightly modified form was enacted as section 9 of the ''Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act 1900'', an [[Act of Parliament|act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]]. The act was given [[royal assent]] on 9 July 1900, was proclaimed on 17 September 1900, and entered into force on 1 January 1901.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Vict/63-64/12/contents/enacted|title=Constitution of Australia Act 1900|website=legislation.gov.uk|accessdate=11 July 2020}} The original text, as of 1900{{mdash}}still official in the UK.</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Constitution of Australia Act 1900|url=https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2013Q00005|accessdate=11 July 2020|website=[[Federal Register of Legislation]]}} The current text.</ref> The constitution gave the six colonies the status of [[States and territories of Australia|states]] within the new federation.

[[Australian constitutional law]] has developed from the interpretation of the constitution by the [[High Court of Australia|High Court]]. As well as its textual provisions, the constitution is understood to incorporate various unwritten [[Constitutional convention (political custom)|constitutional conventions]] and ideas derived from the [[Westminster system]], one of which is [[responsible government]]. Although the 1900 act initially derived its legal authority from the UK Parliament, the present understanding of the High Court and some academics is that it now derives its legal authority from the Australian people.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Lindell|first=G. J.|year=1986|title=Why is Australia's Constitution Binding? - The Reason in 1900 and Now, and the Effect of Independence|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/journals/FedLRev/1986/2.html|journal=Federal Law Review|volume=16|page=29|doi=10.1177/0067205X8601600102|s2cid=159157171}}</ref> Other documents of constitutional significance to Australia include the [[Statute of Westminster 1931|Statute of Westminster]] and the ''[[Australia Act 1986]]''.

The constitution may only be amended by [[Referendums in Australia|referendum]], through the procedure set out in [[Section 128 of the Constitution of Australia|section 128]]. Amendments require a "double majority" – a nationwide majority as well as a majority of voters in a majority of states. This has contributed to the low number of successful amendments; forty-four referendums have been held but only eight amendments have been passed, [[1977 Australian referendum (Referendums)|most recently in 1977]]. Ongoing debates exist regarding further proposals for amendment, notably including the inclusion of a preamble, the replacement of the [[Monarchy of Australia|monarchy]] with [[Republicanism in Australia|a republic]], and the addition of an [[Indigenous voice to government]],

==History==<!--text has no footnotes-->
{{Main|Constitutional history of Australia}}

=== Prior to federation ===
{{Main|Federation of Australia}}
Political movements to federate the Australian colonies grew to prominence in the mid 19th century. Multiple motivations existed for increased political co-operation between the colonies; including a desire to regulate inter-colonial tariffs. Tensions existed however between the larger colonies and the smaller ones, and in the degree to which each colony embraced [[Protectionism|protectionist]] policies. Those tensions and the outbreak of the [[American Civil War]] harmed the political case for federalism in the 1850s and 60s.

In 1889 the [[Federal Council of Australasia]] was established. It arose out of a fear of the growing presence of German and French colonies in the pacific, and a growing Australian identity. The council could legislate on certain subjects but did not have a permanent secretariat, an executive, or independent source of revenue. Perhaps most problematically [[New South Wales]], the largest colony, did not join the body.

A series of conferences to discuss federalism was promoted by the [[Premier of New South Wales]] [[Henry Parkes]]; the first held in 1890 at Melbourne, and another at Sydney in 1891. These conferences were attended by most colonial leaders. By the 1891 conference the federalist cause gained momentum. Discussion turned to what the proper system of federal government ought to be. A draft constitution was drawn up at the conference under the guidance of [[Sir Samuel Griffith]], however, these meetings lacked popular support. An additional problem was that this draft constitution sidestepped some critical issues like tariff policy. The 1891 draft was submitted to colonial parliaments, however it lapsed in New South Wales. After that event other colonies were unwilling to proceed.

In 1895, the six premiers of the Australian colonies agreed to establish a new Convention by popular vote. The Convention met over the course of a year from 1897 to 1898. The meetings produced a new draft which contained substantially the same principles of government as the 1891 draft, but with added provisions for [[responsible government]]. Some delegates to the 1898 Constitutional Convention favoured a section similar to the Bill of Rights of the [[United States Constitution]], but this was decided against.

To ensure popular support, the 1898 draft was presented to the electors of each colony. After one failed attempt, an amended draft was submitted to the electors of each colony except [[Western Australia]]. After ratification by the five colonies, the Bill was presented to the [[British Imperial Parliament]] with an Address requesting [[Queen Victoria]] to enact the Bill.

Prior to the bill's enactment a final change after lobbying by the colonial Chief Justices. This change set a right to appeal from the [[High Court of Australia|High Court]] to the [[Privy Council]]. After the change, the 'Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act' was passed by the British Parliament in 1900. [[Western Australia]] then agreed to join the Commonwealth in order to ensure it would be an 'original state'. The Commonwealth of Australia was then officially established on 1 January 1901.

=== After federation ===
At federation Australia was still regarded as a colonial dominion of the British Empire. British Imperial laws were still in force, although according to [[Robert Menzies]] 'the real and administrative legislative independence of Australia (was) never challenged' since the creation of the Commonwealth.<ref>{{cite news|last=Menzies|first=Robert|date=25 August 1937|title=Statute of Westminster Adoption Bill 1937: Second Reading|publisher=Hansard – Parliament of Australia|url=https://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;db=HANSARD80;id=hansard80%2Fhansardr80%2F1937-08-25%2F0051;query=Id%3A%22hansard80%2Fhansardr80%2F1937-08-25%2F0049%22}}</ref> The formal power of the British Imperial parliament to override Australian legislation was restricted by the UK's 1931 passage of the [[Statute of Westminster 1931|Statute of Westminster]], adopted into Australian law by the [[Statute of Westminster Adoption Act 1942]]. The adoption act acceded Australia to the Statute of Westminister retroactively, with the date set to 3 September 1939, when Australia entered WWII.
[[File:Australia_Act_1986.jpg|thumb|260x260px|Photo of the ''Australia Act 1986'' (United Kingdom) document located in [[Parliament House, Canberra]]]]
Australia did not arguably achieve full de jure independence from the UK until 1986, with the passage of the [[Australia Act 1986|Australia Act]]. That act formally ended the UK parliament's ability to legislate over Australian States, and also abolished all appeals from [[Australian court hierarchy|Australian courts]] to the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council|Privy Council]]. [[Queen Elizabeth II]] traveled to Australia personally to sign the proclamation into law.

In 1988, the original copy of the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act 1900 from the [[Public Record Office]] in London was lent to Australia for the purposes of the [[Australian Bicentenary]]. The Australian government requested permission to keep the copy, and the British Parliament agreed by passing the [[Australian Constitution (Public Record Copy) Act 1990]]. The copy was given to the [[National Archives of Australia]].

A curiosity of the document's history is that the act remains in force at the UK's parliament in its original form,<ref>{{cite web|title=Constitution of Australia Act 1900|url=https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Vict/63-64/12/contents/enacted|accessdate=11 July 2020|website=legislation.gov.uk}}</ref> while in Australia the constitution exists as amended by referendum.<ref>{{cite web|title=Constitution of Australia Act 1900|url=https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2013Q00005|accessdate=11 July 2020|website=[[Federal Register of Legislation]]}}</ref> Australian High Court judges have discussed in [[Obiter dictum|obiter]] that the constitution's source of lawful authority may no longer reside in the imperial parliament, but may instead now derive its lawful authority from the Australian people.<ref name=":1">{{Cite book|last=Saunders|first=Cheryl|title=The Constitution of Australia - A Contextual Analysis|publisher=Hart Publishing|year=2010|isbn=9781841137346}}</ref>

Following the [[2017–18 Australian parliamentary eligibility crisis]], there was discussion of whether to retain or replace the current constitution.<ref>{{cite news|date=17 August 2017|title=The constitution is broken and out of date — we should abolish it and start again|language=en-AU|work=www.abc.net.au|url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-08-18/abolish-the-constitution-and-start-again/8816488|accessdate=1 October 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|date=27 November 2017|title=Principles for a new Australian Constitution|work=The Mandarin|url=https://www.themandarin.com.au/86529-principles-new-australian-constitution/}}</ref> Former Prime Minister [[Bob Hawke]] advocated for getting "rid of the constitution we've got", and replacing the constitution with a system that does not include states.<ref>{{cite news|date=16 August 2017|title=Howard, Hawke criticise career politicians 'with no life experience'|language=en-AU|work=www.abc.net.au|url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-08-17/john-howard-and-bob-hawke-criticise-career-politicians/8814572|accessdate=1 October 2020}}</ref>

== Document structure & Text ==
[[File:Commonwealth_of_Australia_Constitution_Act_(The_Constitution)_as_at_2013.pdf|thumb|The Constitution as amended]]

=== Covering clauses ===
There exist eight 'covering clauses' as preface to the Imperial Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act 1900. The covering clauses are pro-forma [[List of enacting clauses|enacting formulae]], with no effect on the constitution's legal content. The second covering clause sets out that Australia's monarch is to be the same as in the UK.

=== Main document ===
The Constitution is divided into eight chapters, collectively containing 128 sections. The first three chapters state the respective powers of the legislature, executive, and judiciary. This split into three chapters has been interpreted by the High Court as giving rise to a substantive separation of powers doctrine in Australia.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Spry|first=Max|year=1995–96|title=The Executive Power of the commonwealth: its scope and limits|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/pubs/rp/RP9596/96rp28|url-status=live|series=Research Paper 28 Last reviewed 19 July 2004 by the Parliamentary Library Web Manager|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160308015006/http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/pubs/rp/RP9596/96rp28|archive-date=8 March 2016}}</ref>

[[Chapter I of the Constitution of Australia|'''Chapter I: The Parliament''']] sets up the legislative branch of government. Its constituent parts are stated to be the [[Monarchy of Australia|Sovereign]] (represented by the [[Governor-General of Australia|Governor-General]]), the [[Australian Senate|Senate]], and the [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]. It provides for the number of representatives to attend each body, and provides that the representatives attending both must be chosen directly by the electorate. Each electorate of the house of representatives is to be apportioned equally by population, whereas senators are allocated unevenly between 'original states', the territories, and future states (of which none presently exist). The house of representatives is required to have twice as many members as the senate. Chapter 1 also provides for the monarchy. While the incumbent monarch is [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]],<ref>The effect of ''Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act 1900'', section (covering clause) 2.</ref> her legal capacity as queen of Australia is separate to her capacities as monarch to other nations.<ref name="HOZ">''R v Foreign Secretary; Ex parte Indian Association'' [1982] [[Queen's Bench Law Reports|QB]] 892 at 928; approved by the High Court of Australia in {{cite AustLII|HCA|30|1999|litigants=[[Sue v Hill]]|parallelcite=199 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 462|pinpoint=[57]}}.</ref>

The chapter notably also provides for the powers of the Commonwealth parliament. The parliament is not granted [[plenary power]] by the constitution. [[Section 51 of the Australian Constitution|Section 51]] contains a list of enumerated topics that the Commonwealth parliament is permitted to legislate upon. States may also legislate upon these topics, but [[Section 109 of the Australian Constitution|Commonwealth law prevails]] in the event of collision between the laws. Section 52 contains a brief list of topics that only the Commonwealth may legislate upon.

Other matters dealt within the chapter include eligibility issues for voting or standing in elections; and miscellaneous matters regarding parliamentary procedures and allowances.

[[Chapter II of the Constitution of Australia|'''Chapter II: The Executive Government''']] sets up the executive branch. Executive powers are stated to be exercised by the [[Governor-General of Australia|Governor-General]] on the advice of the [[Federal Executive Council (Australia)|Federal Executive Council]]. The Governor-General is stated to be the commander in chief, with power to appoint and dismiss persons within the executive, as well as the power to dissolve parliament. These powers of the governor general are often referred to as [[Governor-General of Australia#Reserve powers|reserve powers]], and by [[Constitutional convention (political custom)#Australia|constitutional convention]] are only exercised on the [[Advice (constitutional)|advice]] of the [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]] in cabinet. On a federal level the reserve powers of the governor general have only been exercised absent the advice of the prime minister one time; when the [[Whitlam Government|Whitlam government]] was [[Whitlam Dismissal|controversially dismissed]] by [[John Kerr (governor-general)|John Kerr]].

Australia's military is also provisioned for within this chapter, with section 68 stating that command of Australia's naval and military forces is to be vested in the Governor-General.
[[File:High_Court_of_Australia_(6769096715).jpg|alt=|thumb|Chapter III establishes [[The High Court of Australia|the High Court]] as Australia's apex court]]
[[Chapter III Court|'''Chapter III: The Judicature''']] sets up the judicial branch. Commonwealth judicial power is vested in a federal supreme court to be called the High Court of Australia. The parliament is authorized to create federal courts, and to vest the exercise of federal judicial power within the courts of the states. Section 74 (now defunct) provides for the circumstances in which an appeal may be made to the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council|Queen in Council]], s75 provides for the High Court's jurisdiction, and s80 guarantees trial by jury for [[indictable offence]]s against the Commonwealth.

[[Chapter IV of the Constitution of Australia|'''Chapter IV: Finance and Trade''']] deals commercial matters within the federation. s81 prescribes all Commonwealth revenue to a [[Consolidated Revenue Fund#Australia|Consolidated Revenue Fund]], and s90 gives the Commonwealth exclusive power over custom and excise duties. [[Section 51(i) of the Australian Constitution#Section 92 of the Constitution|Section 92]] is notable for prescribing 'absolutely free' trade and commerce between the States. Section 96 allows the Commonwealth to make grants on terms determined by Parliament. s101 is notable for setting up the defunct [[Inter-State Commission]].

[[Chapter V of the Constitution of Australia|'''Chapter V: The States''']] contains provisions dealing with the States and their role in the federal system. Sections 106-108 preserve the powers of the States, 109 gives Commonwealth legislation supreme force over that of State governments to the extent of inconsistencies. Section 111 provides for surrender of state territory to the Commonwealth, s114 forbids States from raising military forces, and also forbids inter-government taxation of government property. Section 116 forbids religious tests for office, and the establishment of a national religion.

[[Chapter VI of the Constitution of Australia|'''Chapter VI: New States''']] allows for the establishment or admission of new states, and allows parliament to provide for representation of the territories. It also provides that state boundaries must require the consent of a state before alteration by referendum.

'''Chapter VII: Miscellaneous''' contains provisions on varied topics. Section 125 establishes Melbourne as the nation's temporary capital, while providing for the eventual capital to be established within [[New South Wales]] but no less than {{convert|100|mi|km|spell=in}} from [[Sydney]]. In 1911 New South Wales ceded to the Commonwealth what is now the [[Australian Capital Territory]]. [[Canberra]], built within it, was declared the national capital in 1913. Section 126 permits the Governor-General to appoint deputies

[[Section 127 of the Australian Constitution|Section 127]] provided that "aboriginal natives" were not to be included in headcounts for electoral purposes. That section was [[Australian referendum, 1967 (Aboriginals)|removed by referendum]] in 1967.<ref>{{cite web|last=Korff|first=Jens|date=8 October 2014|title=Australian 1967 Referendum|url=https://www.creativespirits.info/aboriginalculture/history/australian-1967-referendum|accessdate=9 November 2016|website=creativespirits.info}}</ref>

[[Chapter VIII of the Constitution of Australia|'''Chapter VIII: Alteration of the Constitution''']] is a single section providing for amendments. It prescribes that alterations may only occur through a referendum bill being approved at a national referendum. A national referendum under this section requires a 'double majority' to be valid, which consists of a majority return of electors nationally, and a majority return in a majority of states.

===Schedule===
{{See also|Oath of Allegiance (Australia)}}The constitution also contains a schedule setting out the wording of the oath and affirmation of allegiance.<ref name="sch 12">''Constitution (Cth)'' [http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/sch1.html Schedule 1 Oath].</ref> By convention, the Governor-General and members of parliament are required to swear an oath or affirmation of allegiance before taking office.

The oath reads:
{{quote|I, (name), do swear that I will well and truly serve Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth the Second, Her heirs and successors according to law, in the office of Governor-General of the Commonwealth of Australia, and I will do right to all manner of people after the laws and usages of the Commonwealth of Australia, without fear or favour, affection or ill will.

By convention the [[Oath of office|oath or affirmation of office]] made by a prime minister, ministers and parliamentary secretaries when entering office is not that contained within this schedule. Rather, it is determined by the prime minister of the day, and administered to them by the Governor-General. This convention has been in place since 1901.<ref>{{cite web|title=Oaths and affirmations made by the executive and members of federal parliament since 1901|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/pubs/rp/rp1314/OathsAffirmations#_Toc358025341|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307144419/http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/pubs/rp/rp1314/OathsAffirmations|archive-date=7 March 2016|publisher=Parliamentary Library, Department of Parliamentary Services}}</ref>

== Unwritten conventions ==
[[Constitutional convention (political custom)|Constitutional conventions]] are an important part of the Australian constitution. Despite being unwritten, they are understood to be incorporated within the document.<ref>This has been mentioned multiple times by the High Court</ref>

The conventions primarily derive from the unwritten parliamentary conventions within the [[Westminster system|Westminister system]] of [[responsible government]].

Some notable conventions include the existence of the [[Prime Minister of Australia]], as head of cabinet in council. Another is that the Governor-General by convention acts on the advice of the Prime Minister.

=== Unwritten conventions during the dismissal ===
The nature of constitutional conventions gave rise to controversy during [[1975 Australian constitutional crisis|the dismissal]] of the [[Whitlam Government]] in 1975. In that episode, the Governor-General Sir [[John Kerr (Governor-General)|John Kerr]] advised the Queen to dismiss the Labor Prime Minister [[Gough Whitlam]], and appoint the Liberal opposition leader [[Malcolm Fraser]] as caretaker Prime Minister pending the 1975 general election. Multiple conventions were broken during the dismissal including:

* The convention that a State Governments would nominate replacement senators of the same political party in the event of a vacancy. This convention was broken by the [[Tom Lewis (Australian politician)|Lewis]] government of [[New South Wales]] and then by the [[Joh Bjelke-Petersen|Bjelke-Petersen]] government of [[Queensland]] (Bjelke-Petersen appointee [[Albert Field|Albert Patrick Field]] was expelled from the Labor Party before taking his seat).<ref name="Whitlam2">Gough Whitlam. ''The Truth of the Matter''. Penguin. 1979 (Reprint: Melbourne University Press. 2005.)</ref> Notably, this unwritten convention was later formally incorporated into the written constitution via [[Australian referendum, 1977 (Senate Casual Vacancies)|national referendum in 1977]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Reflections from the Seventies (transcript)|url=http://www.abc.net.au/4corners/stories/s350401.htm|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090109202212/http://www.abc.net.au/4corners/stories/s350401.htm|archive-date=9 January 2009|access-date=13 January 2010|publisher=[[ABC Television|ABC TV]] [[Four Corners (Australian TV program)|Four Corners]]}}</ref>
* The convention that the Senate would not vote against money [[Confidence and supply|supply]] to the government. The [[Coalition (Australia)|Liberal-Country party coalition]] blocked supply to the government in 1975, forcing an election.<ref name="Whitlam2" />
* The convention that a Prime Minister who cannot obtain supply must first either request the governor general call a general election, or resign. Gough Whitlam broke this convention by refusing to call an election after the Senate's block of supply.<ref>{{cite web|date=11 November 1975|title=Sir John Kerr's Statement of Reasons|url=http://whitlamdismissal.com/1975/11/11/kerr-statement-of-reasons.html|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160416042105/http://whitlamdismissal.com/1975/11/11/kerr-statement-of-reasons.html|archive-date=16 April 2016}}</ref>

==Interpretation==
{{See also|Australian constitutional law}}The High Court is primarily responsible for interpreting the Constitution. Multiple legal doctrines have been applied by the court in its interpretive process. e.g. the '[[Separation of powers in Australia|separation of powers]]', the '[[Intergovernmental immunity (Australia)|intergovernmental immunities]]' doctrine, the (now defunct) '[[Reserved powers doctrine|reserved state powers]]' doctrine, among others.

While the document does not include a Bill of Rights, some expressly stated rights and/or restrictions are established. Among these are [[Chapter III Court#Section 80: Trial by jury|s80 right to trial by jury]], the [[Section 51(xxxi) of the Constitution of Australia|s51(xxxi) right to just compensation]], the [[Section 117 of the Constitution of Australia|s117 right against discrimination based on state residence]], and the [[Section 116 of the Constitution of Australia|s116 clause prohibiting religious tests for office or establishment of religion]].

The High Court has also read a number of important legal implications into the document. One of these is the '[[Australian constitutional law#Freedom of political communication|freedom of political communication]]', the other is a [[Roach v Electoral Commissioner|freedom of interference from voting in]] at elections. Both doctrines are borne of the s7 and s24 requirements that representatives in Australia's houses of parliament be 'directly chosen by the people'.<ref>{{Cite AustLII|HCA|43|2007|litigants=[[Roach v Electoral Commissioner]]|parallelcite=(2007) [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 162}}.</ref><ref>{{Cite AustLII|HCA|25|1997|litigants=[[Lange v Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]|parallelcite=189 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 520}}.</ref> These doctrines have been characterised as 'freedoms' or 'guarantees' by members of the High Court, and the court has been wary of describing them as 'implied rights' or 'implied constitutional rights'.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|title=Stone, Adrienne --- "Rights, Personal Rights and freedoms: The Nature of the Freedom of Political Communication" [2001] UMelbLRS 1|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/UMelbLRS/2001/1.html|access-date=2020-08-29|website=www.austlii.edu.au}}</ref> [[Adrienne Stone|Some scholars]] have argued that the High Court's purported distinction between a 'right' versus a 'freedom' is misleading and/or little more than semantic, but the term remains in contemporary usage by the court.<ref name=":0" />

== Alterations to the Constitution ==

=== Historical referendums and amendments ===
{{Main|Referendums in Australia|Category:Amendments to the Constitution of Australia}}
Amendment to the Constitution requires a [[referendum]] in which the amending act is approved by a majority in at least four States, as well as a nation-wide majority.

Forty four proposals to amend the Constitution have been voted on at referendums, only eight of which have been approved. Referendums to have achieved approval are:

* [[1906 Australian referendum|1906]]{{spaced ndash}}[[1906 Australian referendum|Senate Elections]]{{spaced ndash}}amended section 13 to slightly alter the length and dates of Senators' terms of office.
* [[1910 Australian referendum|1910]]{{spaced ndash}}[[Australian referendum, 1910 (State Debts)|State Debts]]{{spaced ndash}}amended section 105 to extend the power of the Commonwealth to take over pre-existing State debts, to debts incurred by a State at any time.

=== Existing major amendment proposals ===
Multiple ongoing debates exist regarding changes to the Australian constitution. These include debates on the inclusion of a preamble, proposals for an Australian republic, the addition of a formal recognition and/or Indigenous voice to the document, among other changes.

==== Inclusion of a preamble ====
{{Main|Australian referendum, 1999 (Preamble)}}
The Australian constitution does not itself contain a [[preamble]], although a [[List of enacting formulae|enacting formulae]] prefaces the document as passed in the UK Parliament.

Proposals to include a preamble have been controversial, one argument being that the inclusion of a preamble may affect the High Court's interpretations of other provisions within the document.

In 1999, a proposed preamble principally authored by the then [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]] [[John Howard]] was defeated in a referendum concurrent to that on a proposal to become a [[1999 Australian republic referendum|republic]].

====Republic proposals====
{{Main|Republicanism in Australia}}
Debates on whether Australian should become a republic have existed since Federation.

In November 1999 a referendum was held as to whether the Queen & Governor-General ought be removed from the Australian Constitution, to be replaced with a President. The referendum failed to carry.

====Indigenous recognition and voice====
{{Main|Constitutional recognition of Indigenous Australians}}
Since 1910, there have been calls for constitutional reform to recognise Indigenous Australians.<ref>{{cite book |author1=Expert Panel on Constitutional Recognition of Indigenous Australians |title=Recognising Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples in the Constitution : Report of the Expert Panel |date=2012 |publisher=Commonwealth of Australia |location=Canberra |isbn=9781921975295|url=https://antar.org.au/sites/default/files/expert_panel_report_.pdf |accessdate=15 September 2020 |chapter=1.7 Early voices for change|p=28–31}}</ref> In 1967, the constitution was amended providing the Commonwealth with the power to legislate for all Indigenous Australians by removing the restriction preventing the Commonwealth from legislating in states.<ref>{{cite book |author1=Expert Panel on Constitutional Recognition of Indigenous Australians |title=Recognising Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples in the Constitution : Report of the Expert Panel |date=2012 |publisher=Commonwealth of Australia |location=Canberra |isbn=9781921975295|url=https://antar.org.au/sites/default/files/expert_panel_report_.pdf |accessdate=15 September 2020 |chapter=1.8 The 1967 referendum |p=31}}</ref> At the same time, a limitation on including all Indigenous Australians in population counts for constitutional purposes was removed which in 1967 was now relevant to only section 24.{{sfn|Sawer|1966|p=25-26,30}}{{sfn|Arcioni|2012|p=300-301}} Since those reforms, other proposals have emerged. Guaranteed parliamentary representatives, a constitutionally recognized 'voice', and an inclusion of indigenous Australians in a preamble to the constitution; are all proposals that have been made to reform the Australian constitution to further recognise indigenous Australians.

In his [[Closing the Gap]] speech in February 2020, Prime Minister Morrison reinforced the work of the Referendum Council, rejecting the idea of merely symbolic recognition, supporting a Voice co-designed by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, "using the language of listening and empowerment". The Labor Party has supported a Voice enshrined in the Constitution for a long time, and so have many of Australia's left leaning minor parties.<ref name="Davis 20202">{{cite web|last=Davis|first=Megan|date=17 February 2020|title=Constitutional recognition for Indigenous Australians must involve structural change, not mere symbolism|url=http://theconversation.com/constitutional-recognition-for-indigenous-australians-must-involve-structural-change-not-mere-symbolism-131751|access-date=20 July 2020|website=The Conversation}}</ref>
