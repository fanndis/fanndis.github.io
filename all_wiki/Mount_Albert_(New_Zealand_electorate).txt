'''Mount Albert''' (abbreviated as '''Mt Albert''') is a parliamentary [[New Zealand electorates|electorate]] based around the suburb of [[Mount Albert, New Zealand|Mount Albert]] in [[Auckland]], New Zealand, returning one [[member of Parliament]] (MP) to the [[New Zealand House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]. It has elected only [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour Party]] MPs since it was first contested at the [[1946 New Zealand general election|1946 election]]. The current representative is [[Jacinda Ardern]], who was first elected in a [[2017 Mount Albert by-election|2017 by-election]], gaining 77 percent of votes cast in the preliminary results.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/politics/news/article.cfm?c_id=280&objectid=11807614 |title=Jacinda Ardern wins landslide victory Mt Albert by-election |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |date=25 February 2017 |accessdate=25 February 2017}}</ref> It was previously represented by [[David Shearer]] from [[2009 Mount Albert by-election|13 June 2009]] to 31 December 2016. It was represented by [[Helen Clark]] from the [[1981 New Zealand general election|1981 general election]] until her resignation from Parliament on 17 April 2009.

The area that the electorate contains is notable for having produced three Labour [[List of prime ministers of New Zealand|prime ministers]] – [[Michael Joseph Savage]], who represented the [[Auckland West]] electorate that Mt Albert was created out of in 1946; [[Helen Clark]]; and incumbent Prime Minister [[Jacinda Ardern]]. Additionally, David Shearer served as Labour Party leader in [[Official Opposition (New Zealand)|opposition]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/95363393/mt-albert--the-political-home-of-labour-leaders-for-almost-100-years |author=Moir, Jo |title=Mt Albert – the political home of Labour leaders for almost 100 yearselection |publisher=[[Stuff.co.nz]] |date=2 August 2017 |accessdate=2 August 2017}}</ref> [[Warren Freer]], who represented the electorate from 1947 to 1981, served as acting Prime Minister on three occasions.{{sfn|Freer|2004|p= 190}}

==Population centres==
The [[1941 New Zealand census]] had been postponed due to World War II, so the 1946 electoral redistribution had to take ten years of population growth and movements into account. The [[North Island]] gained a further two electorates from the [[South Island]] due to faster population growth. The abolition of the [[country quota]] through the ''Electoral Amendment Act, 1945'' reduced the number and increased the size of rural electorates. None of the existing electorates remained unchanged, 27 electorates were abolished, eight former electorates were re-established, and 19 electorates were created for the first time, including Mount Albert.{{sfn|McRobie|1989|pp=91–96}}

Mount Albert covers a segment of the western [[Auckland City|Auckland isthmus]], based around the [[Mount Albert, New Zealand|suburb of Mount Albert]] and stretching from [[Kingsland, New Zealand|Kingsland]] on the eastern periphery of the central city down to [[Sandringham, New Zealand|Sandringham]] and extending as far as [[Avondale, Auckland|Avondale]] on the seat's western edge. Changes brought about by an electoral redistribution after the 2006 census saw a swap of suburbs with neighbouring {{NZ electorate link|Auckland Central}} – [[Newton, New Zealand|Newton]] on the city fringe being returned to Auckland Central, having been moved out in 1999, and [[Point Chevalier]] being drafted in.

The present incarnation of Mount Albert dates to 1999, when the creation of the [[Mount Roskill (New Zealand electorate)|Mount Roskill]] seat necessitated removing the suburbs clustered around the north side of [[Manukau Harbour]] from the [[Owairaka (New Zealand electorate)|Owairaka]] electorate. The name Mount Albert had been out of use for only three years – before Owairaka was drawn up ahead of the change to [[Mixed-member proportional representation|Mixed Member Proportional]] voting in 1996, the Mount Albert electorate had been part of the New Zealand electoral landscape for fifty years.

==History==
Mount Albert was first created for the 1946 election.{{sfn|Wilson|1985|p=267}} The electorate is known for being contested by three later [[Prime Minister of New Zealand|prime minister]]s, [[Robert Muldoon]], [[Helen Clark]] and [[Jacinda Ardern]].

The first representative, [[Arthur Shapton Richards]], died after only one year in the office.<ref>{{cite news |last=Gower |first=Patrick |title=Seven Labour candidates tipped to try for Mt Albert seat |url= http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10564413 |accessdate=7 November 2013 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |date=31 March 2009}}</ref>

Richards was succeeded by [[Warren Freer]] in the {{By-election link|Mount Albert|1947}}, and Freer held the electorate until he retired in 1981.{{sfn|Wilson|1985|p=198}} Freer was challenged in the {{NZ election link|1954}} by [[New Zealand National Party|National]]'s Muldoon (Prime Minister from 1975 to 1984). This occasion was Muldoon's first attempt at entering Parliament.<ref name="DNZB Muldoon">{{DNZB|Gustafson|Barry|6m1|Muldoon, Robert David|30 December 2013||Barry Gustafson}}<!-- go to page 3 of the source --></ref> He tried to claim the seat from Labour, but no National Party candidate has ever managed to achieve what Muldoon also couldn't do. Mount Albert's inner-suburb, working-class composition makes it one of the Labour Party's safest seats. Muldoon had also previously in {{NZ election link year|1951}}, failed to win the National nomination for the Mount Albert electorate.<ref name="DNZB Muldoon" />

Freer was succeeded by Helen Clark,{{sfn|Wilson|1985|p=189}} who held the electorate until 1996, when it was abolished and she moved to the {{NZ electorate link|Owairaka}} electorate instead. When the Mount Albert electorate was re-established for the {{NZ election link|1999}}, Clark became the representative again. Clark was Prime Minister from 1999 to 2008. In 2009, she resigned to become head of the [[United Nations Development Programme]].<ref>{{cite press release

Clark was succeeded by [[David Shearer]] through the [[2009 Mount Albert by-election|13 June 2009 by-election]]. He was re-elected as MP in the 2011 and 2014 general elections. His appointment to lead the United Nation's peacekeeping mission in [[South Sudan]] resulted in a by-election in early 2017.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/87545651/David-Shearer-formally-appointed-to-lead-UN-peacekeeping-team-in-South-Sudan |title=David Shearer formally appointed to lead UN peacekeeping team in South Sudan |publisher=Stuff.co.nz |date=14 December 2016 |author=Sam Sachdeva |accessdate=19 December 2016}}</ref> After the by-election, [[Jacinda Ardern]] became the new representative for the electorate, and became Labour leader 8 weeks before the 2017 election after Andrew Little stepped down as Labour leader. Ardern also moved electorate from [[Auckland Central (New Zealand electorate)|Auckland Central]], and won the Mt. Albert MP role in the 2017 election.
