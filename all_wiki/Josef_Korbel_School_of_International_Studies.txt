==History==
[[File:Sie Center Josef Korbel School 2012.jpg|250px|right|thumb|The Sié Chéou-Kang Center for International Security and Diplomacy, part of the Josef Korbel School]]
The Department of [[International Relations]] at the University of Denver was first directed by Dr. Ben Mark Cherrington, an educator and policy maker who was associated with some of his era's preeminent political thinkers, including [[Gandhi]], [[Louis Brandeis]] and [[Ramsay MacDonald]].<ref name="Our History">{{cite web|title=Our history|url=http://www.du.edu/korbel/about/ourhistory.html|publisher=University of Denver|accessdate=21 February 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120105171552/http://www.du.edu/korbel/about/ourhistory.html|archivedate=5 January 2012}}</ref>

According to the University of Denver, "In 1938, Cherrington was handpicked by the United States [[U.S. Department of State|Department of State]] to lead its new Division of Cultural Relations and tasked with carrying out 'the exchange of professors, teachers, and students...cooperation in the field of music, art, literature...international radio broadcasts...generally, the dissemination abroad of the representative intellectual and cultural work of the U.S.'"<ref name="Our History"/> Cherrington later became chancellor of the University of Denver from 1943 to 1946, and he was also a contributing author to the [[United Nations Charter]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Ben Mark Cherrington|url=http://library.du.edu/dupedia/category/people/chancellors/ben-cherrington|work=DUPedia|publisher=University of Denver, Penrose Library|accessdate=21 February 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111206210222/http://library.du.edu/dupedia/category/people/chancellors/ben-cherrington|archivedate=6 December 2011}}</ref>

The Graduate School of International Studies (GSIS) was established under the efforts of Josef Korbel, who became its first dean, in 1964. Decades earlier, he had been forced to flee during the Communist coup in [[Czechoslovakia]] in 1948.<ref name="NPRKorbel">{{cite news|last=Raz|first=Guy|title=For Albright and Rice, Josef Korbel Is Tie that Binds|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5516648|accessdate=21 February 2012|newspaper=NPR|date=28 June 2006}}</ref> Korbel was granted political asylum in the [[United States]] and was hired in 1949 to teach international politics at the University of Denver. To house the school, the {{convert|30300|sqft|m2|adj=on}} Ben M. Cherrington Hall was built in 1965.

Nearly 25 years after Korbel's death, the University of Denver established the Josef Korbel Humanitarian Award in 2000. In 2008, the Graduate School of International Studies was renamed the Josef Korbel School of International Studies, in his honor and in recognition of his family's support.<ref name="KorbelNaming">{{cite news|title=GSIS renamed in honor of founder Josef Korbe|url=http://www.du.edu/korbel/docs/alumni_newsletter_fa.pdf|accessdate=8 March 2012|newspaper=Josef Korbel School Alumni Newsletter|date=Fall 2008|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121002022254/http://www.du.edu/korbel/docs/alumni_newsletter_fa.pdf|archivedate=2 October 2012}}</ref>
