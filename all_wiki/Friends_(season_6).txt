|ShortSummary=In Vegas, Ross and Rachel initially have no memory of getting married the previous night, then must deal with the aftermath of their drunken escapade. Phoebe and Joey drive back to New York in Phoebe's cab. She becomes angry when Joey sleeps most of the way rather than playing his promised fun road trip games; she unnerves Joey by picking up a hitchhiker while he was napping. Back at home, Monica and Chandler ponder the idea of marriage and decide to take their relationship forward a step by living together.
----
'''Opening Credit Gag:''' [[Courteney Cox]] married [[David Arquette]] between seasons 5 and 6 and she changed her last name to Cox-Arquette. As a tribute to them, [[Courteney Cox|Courteney Cox-Arquette]] was given top billing for the episode, and "-Arquette" was added to every cast member's last name in the opening credits.

Ross adamantly denies this and unsuccessfully attempts to secretly annul the marriage himself. Monica and Chandler announce they are moving in together. Joey reacts badly to the news, though Chandler reassures him their friendship will remain the same. Rachel mistakenly believes all three will be living together until Monica explains Rachel has to move out. Rachel then upsets Monica by her blas√© reaction, convinced Monica and Chandler will never go through with it. When Monica assures her they will, Rachel becomes distraught and seeks comfort from Ross, just as he is about to tell her the truth about their marriage.
