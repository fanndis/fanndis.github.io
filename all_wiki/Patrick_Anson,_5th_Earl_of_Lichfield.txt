Lichfield joined the [[Grenadier Guards]] in 1959. On leaving the Army in 1962, he began to work as a photographer's assistant, and built up his own reputation, partly as a result of having access to the Royal Family. He was selected to take the official photographs of the wedding of the [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince]] and [[Diana, Princess of Wales|Princess of Wales]] in 1981, and subsequently became one of the UK's best-known photographers. From 1999 onwards he was a pioneer of digital photography as a professional standard. He was chosen by the [[Elizabeth II|Queen]] and the [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Duke of Edinburgh]] to take official pictures of her [[Golden Jubilee of Elizabeth II|Golden Jubilee]] in 2002.

He made a cameo appearances in the  '''[[Casualty (TV_series)|Casualty]] '''in 2003 episode ''In the frame'', ''[[Keeping Up Appearances]]'' episode ''Sea Fever'' as a passenger on the [[Queen Elizabeth 2]].{{cn|date=September 2020}}
