The terrain is rugged; the [[climate]] is [[Oceanic climate#Subpolar variety (Cfc)|subpolar oceanic climate (Cfc)]]{{mdash}}windy, wet, cloudy, and cool. Temperatures average above freezing throughout the year because of the [[Gulf Stream]]. As a result of the moderation and the northerly latitude, summers normally hover around {{convert|12|C|F}}. Average temperatures are 5&nbsp;°C (41&nbsp;°F) in winter.<ref>{{Cite web |date=19 December 2018 |title=The unpredictable Faroe Islands weather |url=https://www.guidetofaroeislands.fo/travel-information/the-weather-in-the-faroe-islands |website=Guide to Faroe Islands}}</ref> The northerly latitude location also results in perpetual civil twilight during summer nights and very short winter days.

Between 1035 and 1814, the Faroe Islands were part of the [[Kingdom of Norway (872–1397)|Kingdom of Norway]], which was in a [[personal union]] with Denmark from 1450. In 1814, the [[Treaty of Kiel]] transferred Norway to the [[King of Sweden]], on the winning side of the [[Napoleonic Wars]], whereas Denmark retained the Faroe Islands, along with [[Greenland]] and [[Iceland]]. The Faroe Islands have been a [[Self-governance|self-governing]] part of the Kingdom of Denmark since 1948,{{citation needed|date=August 2020}} controlling most areas apart from [[Danish Defence|military defence]], [[Police of Denmark|policing]], [[Justice Minister of Denmark|justice]], [[currency]], and [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (Denmark)|foreign affairs]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Lov om de færøske myndigheders overtagelse af sager og sagsområder (Also called: Overtagelsesloven) |url=https://www.retsinformation.dk/Forms/R0710.aspx?id=20991 |website=Retsinformation.dk |language=da}}</ref> Because the Faroe Islands are not part of the same [[customs area]] as Denmark, the country has an independent [[Commercial policy|trade policy]], and can establish trade agreements with other states. The Faroes have an extensive bilateral free trade agreement with Iceland, known as the [[Hoyvík Agreement]]. In the [[Nordic Council]], they are represented as part of the Danish delegation. In certain sports, the Faroe Islands field their own national teams.

Despite only having [[Niels Ryberg Finsen|one laureate]], the Faroe Islands currently have the most [[List of countries by Nobel laureates per capita|Nobel laureates per capita]] worldwide.

==Etymology==
In [[Faroese language|Faroese]], the name appears as ''{{lang|fo|Føroyar}}''. ''{{lang|fo|Oyar}}'' represents the plural of ''{{lang|fo|oy}}'', older Faroese for "island". Due to sound changes, the modern Faroese word for island is ''oyggj''. The first element, ''{{lang|fo|før}}'', may reflect an Old Norse word ''{{lang|non|fær}}'' (sheep), although this analysis is sometimes disputed because Faroese now uses the word ''{{lang|fo|seyður}}'' (from Old Norse ''{{lang|non|sauðr}}'') to mean "sheep". Another possibility is that the Irish monks, who settled the island around 625, had already given the islands a name related to the Gaelic word ''{{lang|ga|fearrann}}'', meaning "land" or "estate". This name could then have been passed on to the Norwegian settlers, who then added ''{{lang|fo|oyar}}'' (islands).<ref>{{Cite web |title=færøske — Den Danske Ordbog |url=http://ordnet.dk/ddo/ordbog?query=f%C3%A6r%C3%B8ske |website=ordnet.dk}}</ref> The name thus translates as either "Islands of Sheep" or "Islands of Fearrann".

In [[Danish language|Danish]], the name ''{{lang|da|Færøerne}}'' contains the same elements, though ''{{lang|da|øerne}}'' is the definite plural of ''{{lang|da|ø}}'' (island).

In English, it may be seen as redundant to say ''the Faroe Islands'', since the ''oe'' comes from an element meaning "island". This is seen in the [[BBC]] [[Shipping Forecast]], where the waters around the islands are called ''Faeroes''. The name is also sometimes spelled "Faeroe".<ref>{{Cite web |title=Faroe Islands |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/faroe+islands |access-date=20 March 2015 |website=Merriam-Webster Dictionary}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Faeroe Islands |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Faeroe%20Islands |access-date=20 March 2015 |website=[[Dictionary.com]]}}</ref>

==History==
{{main|History of the Faroe Islands}}

Archaeological evidence shows settlers living on the Faroe Islands in two successive periods before the Norse arrived, the first between 300 and 600 and the second between 600 and 800.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Church |first=M.

He also suggested that the people living there might have been from [[Ireland]], [[Scotland]], or [[Scandinavia]], possibly with groups from all three areas settling there.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Choi |first=Charles Q |date=22 August 2013 |title=Mystery settlers, whoever they were, reached islands before Vikings |work=NBC Science News |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/science/mystery-settlers-whoever-they-were-reached-islands-vikings-C10975706! |access-date=2 September 2013}}{{Dead link|date=August 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

A Latin account of a voyage made by [[Brendan]], an Irish monastic saint who lived around 484–578, includes a description of ''insulae'' (islands) resembling the Faroe Islands. This association, however, is far from conclusive in its description.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Navigatio Sancti Brendani Abbatis |url=http://www.hs-augsburg.de/~harsch/Chronologia/Lspost10/Brendanus/bre_navi.html}} See translation: {{cite web |title=Nauigatio sancti Brendani abbatis [the Voyage of St Brendan the Abbot] chapter XI, edition by Archbishop P. F. Moran, tr. Denis O'Donoghue, Brendaniana, 1893 |url=http://markjberry.blogs.com/StBrendan.pdf }}</ref>

[[Dicuil]], an Irish monk of the early ninth century, wrote a more definite account. In his geographical work ''De mensura orbis terrae'' he claimed he had reliable information of ''heremitae ex nostra Scotia'' ("hermits from our land of Ireland/Scotland") who had lived on the northerly islands of Britain for almost a hundred years until the arrival of Norse pirates.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Chapter 7.2 |url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Dicuil/De_mensura_orbis_terrae/text*.html |access-date=14 March 2014 |publisher=Penelope.uchicago.edu}}</ref>

Norsemen settled the islands c. 800, bringing [[Old Norse#Old West Norse|Old West Norse]], which evolved into the modern [[Faroese language]]. According to Icelandic sagas such as ''Færeyjar Saga'', one of the best known men in the island was [[Tróndur í Gøtu]], a descendant of Scandinavian chiefs who had settled in [[Dublin]], Ireland. Tróndur led the battle against [[Sigmund Brestursson]], the Norwegian monarchy and the Norwegian church.

[[File:Faroe Islands, 1767, as seen by Yves de Kerguelen Trémarec.PNG|thumb|left|The Faroe Islands as seen by the Breton navigator [[Yves-Joseph de Kerguelen-Trémarec]] in 1767]]
The Norse and [[Norse–Gaels|Norse–Gael]] settlers probably did not come directly from Scandinavia, but rather from Norse communities surrounding the [[Irish Sea]], [[Northern Isles]], and [[Outer Hebrides]] of [[Scotland]], including the [[Shetland]] and [[Orkney]] islands. A traditional name for the islands in [[Irish language|Irish]], ''Na Scigirí'', possibly refers to the ''(Eyja-)Skeggjar'' "(Island-)Beards", a nickname given to island dwellers.

According to the ''[[Færeyinga saga]]'', more emigrants left Norway who did not approve of the monarchy of [[Harald Fairhair]] (ruled c. 872 to 930). These people settled the Faroes around the end of the ninth century.<ref>{{Cite web |title=The Faroe Islands, Faroese History – A part of Randburg |url=http://www.randburg.com/fa/general/general_5.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120907123238/http://www.randburg.com/fa/general/general_5.html |archive-date=7 September 2012 |publisher=Randburg.com |df=dmy-all}}</ref> Early in the eleventh century, [[Sigmundur Brestisson]] (961–1005) – whose clan had flourished in the southern islands before invaders from the northern islands almost [[genocide|exterminated]] it – escaped to Norway. He was sent back to take possession of the islands for [[Olaf Tryggvason]], [[monarchy of Norway|King of Norway]] from 995 to 1000. Sigmundur introduced Christianity, forcing Tróndur í Gøtu to convert or face beheading and, although Sigmundur was subsequently murdered, Norwegian taxation was upheld. Norwegian control of the Faroes continued until 1814, although, when the [[Kingdom of Norway (872–1397)]] entered the [[Kalmar Union]] with Denmark, it gradually resulted in Danish control of the islands. The [[Protestant Reformation]] in the form of [[Lutheranism]] reached the Faroes in 1538. When the union between Denmark and Norway dissolved as a result of the [[Treaty of Kiel]] in 1814, Denmark retained possession of the Faroe Islands; Norway itself was joined in a union with Sweden.

Following the turmoil caused by the [[Napoleonic Wars]] (1803-1815) in 1816, the Faroe Islands became a county in the [[Kingdom of Denmark|Danish Kingdom]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=CIDOB - Secession and Counter-secession.

As part of [[Mercantilism]], Denmark maintained a [[Danish Royal Trade Monopoly in the Faroe Islands|monopoly over trade]] with the Faroe Islands and forbade their inhabitants trading with others (e.g. the geographically close Britain). The trade monopoly in the Faroe Islands was abolished in 1856, after which the area developed as a modern fishing nation with its own [[fishing fleet]]. The national awakening from 1888 initially arose from a struggle to maintain the [[Faroese language]] and was thus [[culture|culturally]] oriented, but after 1906 it became more [[politics|political]] with the foundation of [[list of political parties in the Faroe Islands|political parties of the Faroe Islands]].

In the first year of the [[Second World War]], on 12 April 1940, [[British occupation of the Faroe Islands|British troops occupied the Faroe Islands]]. [[Nazi Germany]] had invaded Denmark and commenced the invasion of Norway on 9 April 1940 under [[Operation Weserübung]]. In 1942–1943, the British [[Royal Monmouthshire Royal Engineers|Royal Engineers]], under the leadership of Lt. Col. William Law, [[Military Cross|MC]], built the only airport in the Faroe Islands, [[Vágar Airport]]. Control of the islands reverted to Denmark following the war, but Danish rule had been undermined, and [[Iceland]]'s full independence served as a precedent for many Faroese.

The [[1946 Faroese independence referendum]] resulted in 50.73% in favour of independence to 49.27% against.<ref>[http://www.sudd.ch/event.php?lang=en&id=fo011946 Faroe Islands, 14 September 1946: Status] Direct Democracy {{in lang|de}}</ref> The Faroe Islands subsequently declared independence on 18 September 1946; however, this declaration was annulled by [[Denmark]] on 20 September on the grounds that a majority of the Faroese voters had not supported independence and [[Christian X of Denmark|King Christian X of Denmark]] dissolved the Faroese [[Løgting]] on 24 September.<ref name="Steining185">{{Cite book |last=Steining |first=Jørgen |title=Den danske rigsdag 1849–1949 bind VI |publisher=J.

In 1973 the Faroe Islands declined to join Denmark in entering the [[European Economic Community]] (later absorbed into the [[European Union]]). The islands experienced considerable economic difficulties following the collapse of the fishing industry in the early 1990s.{{Citation needed|date=July 2020}}

=== Climate ===
{{see also|Geography of the Faroe Islands#Climate}}
[[File:Faroe Islands, Eysturoy, Skipanes and Undir Gøtueiði.jpg|thumb|[[Skipanes]] on [[Eysturoy]], with different weather in the distance]]
The climate is classed as [[subpolar oceanic climate]] according to the [[Köppen climate classification]]: [[Oceanic climate|Cfc]], with areas having a [[tundra]] climate, especially in the mountains, although some coastal or low-lying areas may have very mild-winter versions of a tundra climate. The overall character of the climate of the islands is influenced by the strong warming influence of the Atlantic Ocean, which produces the [[North Atlantic Current]]. This, together with the remoteness of any source of landmass-induced warm or cold airflows, ensures that winters are mild (mean temperature 3.0 to 4.0&nbsp;°C or 37 to 39&nbsp;°F) while summers are cool (mean temperature 9.5 to 10.5&nbsp;°C or 49 to 51&nbsp;°F).

The islands are windy, cloudy, and cool throughout the year with an average of 210 rainy or snowy days per year. The islands lie in the path of depressions moving northeast, making strong winds and heavy rain possible at all times of the year. Sunny days are rare and overcast days are common. [[Hurricane Faith]] struck the Faroe Islands on 5 September 1966 with sustained winds over 100&nbsp;mph (160&nbsp;km/h) and only then did the storm cease to be a tropical system.<ref>GHCN Climate data, Thorshavn series 1881 to 2007</ref>

[[File:Faroe Islands, Eysturoy, Funningsfjørður (fjord) in October.jpg|left|thumb|An October evening on [[Eysturoy]]]]
The climate varies greatly over small distances, due to the altitude, ocean currents, topography, and winds. Precipitation varies considerably throughout the archipelago. In some highland areas, snow cover may last for months with snowfalls possible for the greater part of the year (on the highest peaks, summer snowfall is by no means rare), while in some sheltered coastal locations, several years pass without any snowfall whatsoever. Tórshavn receives frosts more often than other areas just a short distance to the south. Snow also is seen at a much higher frequency than on outlying islands nearby. The area receives on average 49 frosts a year.<ref name="DMI" />

The collection of meteorological data on the Faroe Islands began in 1867.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Plant production on a Faeroese farm 1813–1892, related to climatic fluctuations |url=http://rdgs.dk/djg/pdfs/101/1/06.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120317115552/http://rdgs.dk/djg/pdfs/101/1/06.pdf |archive-date=17 March 2012 |access-date=25 August 2013 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> Winter recording began in 1891, and the warmest winter occurred in 2016–17 with an average temperature of 6.1&nbsp;°C (43&nbsp;°F).<ref>{{Cite web |date=3 March 2017 |title=Rekordvarm vinter på Færøerne |url=http://www.dmi.dk/nyheder/arkiv/nyheder-2017/marts/rekordvarm-vinter-paa-faeroeerne/ |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170307183257/http://www.dmi.dk/nyheder/arkiv/nyheder-2017/marts/rekordvarm-vinter-paa-faeroeerne |archive-date=7 March 2017 |access-date=7 March 2017 |publisher=[[Danish Meteorological Institute]]}}</ref>

=== Nature ===

==== Flora ====
{{main|Flora of the Faroe Islands}}
[[File:Myrisolja.jpg|thumb|Marsh marigold (''[[Caltha palustris]]'') is common in the Faroe Islands during May and June.]]
The natural vegetation of the Faroe Islands is dominated by arctic-alpine plants, wildflowers, grasses, moss, and lichen. Most of the lowland area is grassland and some is heath, dominated by shrubby heathers, mainly [[Calluna|''Calluna vulgaris'']]. Among the herbaceous flora that occur in the Faroe Islands is the cosmopolitan marsh thistle, ''[[Cirsium palustre]]''.<ref>Hogan, C. Michael (2009) [http://www.globaltwitcher.com/artspec_information.asp?thingid=48639 ''Marsh Thistle: Cirsium palustre'', GlobalTwitcher, ed. N.

Although there are no trees native to the Faroe Islands, limited species were able to be successfully introduced to the region, including the [[Populus trichocarpa#Distribution|black cottonwood]], also known as the California poplar (''Populus trichocarpa'').

A collection of Faroese marine [[algae]] resulting from a survey sponsored by [[NATO]],{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} the [[British Museum]] (Natural History) and the Carlsberg Foundation, is preserved in the [[Ulster Museum]] (catalogue numbers: F3195–F3307). It is one of ten [[wiktionary|exsiccatae]] sets. A few small plantations consisting of plants collected from similar climates such as [[Tierra del Fuego]] in South America and [[Alaska]] thrive on the islands.

{{main|List of birds of the Faroe Islands}}
The [[List of birds of the Faroe Islands|bird fauna of the Faroe Islands]] is dominated by [[seabird]]s and birds attracted to open land such as [[Calluna|heather]], probably because of the lack of woodland and other suitable habitats. Many species have developed special Faroese sub-species: [[common eider]], [[Common starling]], [[Eurasian wren]], [[common murre]], and [[black guillemot]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=The Faroese Fauna |url=http://www.mundofree.com/islasferoe/thefaroesefauna.html |access-date=25 August 2013 |publisher=Mundofree.com}}</ref> The [[pied raven]], a color morph of the North Atlantic subspecies of the [[common raven]], was [[endemism|endemic]] to the Faroe Islands, but now has become extinct.

Only a few species of wild land mammals are found in the Faroe Islands today, all introduced by humans. Three species are thriving on the islands today: [[mountain hare]] (''Lepus timidus''), [[brown rat]] (''Rattus norvegicus''), and the [[house mouse]] (''Mus musculus''). Apart from these, there is a local domestic sheep breed, the [[Faroe sheep]] (depicted on the [[Coat of arms of the Faroe Islands|coat of arms]]), and there once was a variety of [[feral animal|feral sheep]], which survived on [[Lítla Dímun]] until the mid-nineteenth century.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Ryder |first=M.

The Faroese government holds [[executive power]] in local government affairs. The head of the government is called the ''[[Løgmaður]]'' ("Chief Justice") and serves as Prime Minister and head of Faroese Government. Any other member of the cabinet is called a ''[[Minister (government)|landsstýrismaður/ráðharri]]'' ("Male Minister of the Faroese Government") or ''landsstýriskvinna/ráðfrú'' ("Female Minister of the Faroese Government"). The Faroese parliament – the ''[[Løgting]]'' ("Court of Law") – dates back to Viking times and is believed to be one of the oldest parliaments in the world. The parliament currently has 33 members.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Tingmenn |url=http://www.logting.fo/parliamentmember/list.gebs?menuChanged=31 |access-date=14 March 2014 |publisher=Logting.fo |language=fo}}</ref>

[[File:Tinganes.jpg|thumb|left|[[Tinganes]] in [[Tórshavn]], seat of a part of the Faroese government]]

In contemporary times, elections are held at municipal, national (''[[Løgting]]''), and Danish (''[[Folketing]]'') levels. Until 2007, there were seven electoral districts, each comprising a ''sýsla'', while Streymoy was divided into a northern and southern part ([[Tórshavn]] region). However, on 25 October 2007, changes were made such that the entire country is one electoral district, giving each vote equal weight.

=== Administrative divisions ===
{{main|Regions of the Faroe Islands|Municipalities of the Faroe Islands}}
[[File:Map of the Faroe Islands en.svg|thumb|upright=1.3|Relief map of the Faroe Islands]]

Administratively, the islands are divided into 29 [[Municipalities of the Faroe Islands|municipalities]] (''kommunur'') within which there are 120 or so [[list of towns in the Faroe Islands|settlements]].

Traditionally, there are also the [[Regions of the Faroe Islands|six ''sýslur'']] (similar to the British "shire": [[Norðoyar]], [[Eysturoy]], [[Streymoy]], [[Vágar]], [[Sandoy]], and [[Suðuroy]]). Although today ''[[sýsla]]'' technically means "police district", the term is still commonly used to indicate a geographical region. In earlier times, each ''sýsla'' had its own [[Thing (assembly)|assembly]], the so-called ''várting'' ("spring assembly").

=== Relationship with Denmark ===
{{Multiple issues|{{POV section|date=March 2020}}{{More citations needed section|date=March 2020}}|section=yes}}
The Faroe Islands have been under Norwegian-Danish control since 1388. The 1814 [[Treaty of Kiel]] terminated the [[Denmark–Norway|Danish–Norwegian]] union, and Norway came under the rule of the [[King of Sweden]], while the Faroe Islands, Iceland, and [[Greenland]] remained Danish possessions. From ancient times the Faroe Islands had a parliament (''Løgting''), which was abolished in 1816, and the Faroe Islands were to be governed as an ordinary [[Counties of Denmark|Danish amt]] (county), with the [[Prefect|Amtmand]] as its head of government. In 1851, the ''Løgting'' was reinstated, but, until 1948, served mainly as an advisory body.

The islands are home to a notable [[Faroese independence|independence movement]] that has seen an increase in popularity within recent decades. At the end of [[World War II]], some of the population favoured independence from Denmark, and on 14 September 1946, [[1946 Faroese independence referendum|an independence referendum]] was held on the question of [[secession]]. It was a consultative referendum; the parliament was not bound to follow the people's vote. This was the first time that the Faroese people had been asked whether they favoured independence or wanted to continue within the [[Danish kingdom]].

[[File:Queen Margrethe 21-06-2005 Vágur.jpg|thumb|left|Queen [[Margrethe II of Denmark|Margrethe II]], monarch of the [[Unity of the Realm]], during a visit to [[Vágur]] in 2005]]
The result of the vote was a majority in favour of secession. The Speaker of the Løgting, together with the majority, started the process of becoming a sovereign nation. The minority of the Løgting left in protest, because they thought these actions were illegal. One parliament member, Jákup í Jákupsstovu, was shunned from his own party, the Social Democratic Party, because he joined the majority of the Løgting.

The Speaker of the Løgting declared the Faroe Islands independent on 18 September 1946.

On 25 September 1946, a Danish prefect announced to the Løgting, that the king had dissolved the parliament and wanted new elections, therefore not honoring the wish of the majority.

A parliamentary election was held a few months later, in which the political parties that favoured staying in the Danish kingdom increased their share of the vote and formed a coalition. Based on this, they chose to reject secession. Instead, a compromise was made and the [[Folketing]] passed a home-rule law that went into effect in 1948. The Faroe Islands' status as a Danish ''amt'' was thereby brought to an end; the Faroe Islands were given a high degree of self-governance, supported by a financial [[subsidy]] from Denmark to recompense expenses the islands have on Danish services.

In protest to the new Home Rule Act, the Republic Party (Tjóðveldi), was founded.

At present, the islanders are about evenly split between those favouring independence and those who prefer to continue as a part of the Kingdom of Denmark. Within both camps there is a wide range of opinions. Of those who favour independence, some are in favour of an immediate [[unilateral declaration of independence]]. Others see it as something to be attained gradually and with the full consent of the Danish government and the [[Danish nation]]. In the unionist camp there are also many who foresee and welcome a gradual increase in autonomy even while strong ties with Denmark are maintained.

{{As of|2011}}, a new draft Faroese constitution is being drawn up. However the draft has been declared by the former [[Danish Prime Minister]], [[Lars Løkke Rasmussen]], as incompatible with Denmark's constitution and if the Faroese political parties wish to continue with it, then they must declare independence.<ref>[http://www.icenews.is/index.php/2011/07/06/denmark-and-faroe-islands-in-constitutional-clash/ Denmark and Faroe Islands in constitutional clash], IceNews 6 July 2011</ref>

=== Relationship with the European Union ===
{{main|Faroe Islands and the European Union}}
As explicitly asserted by both [[treaties of the European Union]], the Faroe Islands are not part of the [[European Union]]. The Faroes are not grouped with the EU when it comes to international trade; for instance, when the EU and Russia imposed reciprocal trade sanctions on each other over the [[War in Donbass]] in 2014, the Faroes began exporting significant amounts of fresh [[salmon]] to Russia.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Troianovski |first=Anton |date=21 February 2015 |title=Faeroe Islands Boom by Selling Salmon to Russia |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/faeroe-islands-boom-by-selling-salmon-to-russia-1424483776 |via=Wall Street Journal}}</ref> Moreover, a [[special member state territories and the European Union#Faroe Islands|protocol]] to the treaty of accession of Denmark to the European Communities stipulates that Danish nationals residing in the Faroe Islands are not considered Danish nationals within the meaning of the treaties. Hence, Danish people living in the Faroes are not [[citizenship of the European Union|citizens of the European Union]] (though other EU nationals living there remain EU citizens). The Faroes are not covered by the [[Schengen Agreement]], but there are no border checks when travelling between the Faroes and any Schengen country (the Faroes have been part of the [[Nordic Passport Union]] since 1966, and since 2001 there have been no permanent border checks between the Nordic countries and the rest of the [[Schengen Area]] as part of the Schengen agreement).<ref>{{Cite web |title=Implementation of Schengen convention by the prime minister as approved by the Løgting |url=http://www.tinganes.fo/logir/Rikislogartilmaeli/2001Schengen.htm |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721114619/http://www.tinganes.fo/logir/Rikislogartilmaeli/2001Schengen.htm |archive-date=21 July 2011 |access-date=25 August 2013 |publisher=Tinganes.fo}}</ref>

=== Relationship with international organisations ===
The Faroe Islands are not a fully independent country, but they do have political relations directly with other countries through agreement with Denmark.

The 2011 census shows that of the 48,346 inhabitants of the Faroe Islands (17,441 private households in 2011), 43,135 were born in the Faroe Islands, 3,597 were born in the other two countries of the Kingdom of Denmark (Denmark or Greenland), and 1,614 were born outside the Kingdom of Denmark. People were also asked about their nationality, including Faroese.

If the first inhabitants of the Faroe Islands were [[Irish people|Irish]] monks, they must have lived as a very small group of settlers. Later, when the Vikings colonised the islands, there was a considerable increase in the population. However, it never exceeded 5,000 until the 19th century. Around 1349, about half the population perished in the [[Black Death]] plague.

Only with the rise of the deep-sea fishery (and thus independence from agriculture in the islands' harsh terrain) and with general progress in the health service was rapid population growth possible in the Faroes. Beginning in the 19th century, the population increased tenfold in 200 years.

At the beginning of the 1990s, the Faroe Islands entered a deep economic crisis leading to heavy emigration; however, this trend reversed in subsequent years to a net immigration. This has been in the form of a population replacement as young Faroese women leave and are replaced with Asian/Pacific brides.<ref>{{Cite news |date=23 October 2013 |title=Faroe Islands: Men 'must import brides' |work=BBC News |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-news-from-elsewhere-24637771}}</ref>
In 2011, there were 2,155 more men than women between the age of 0 to 59 in the Faroe Islands.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Rana |first=Danjal av |date=22 January 2015 |title=Fáið kvinnurnar heimaftur |url=http://www.in.fo/news-detail/news/faid-kvinnurnar-heimaftur/ |access-date=4 February 2015 |publisher=Sosialurin – in.fo |language=fo}}</ref>

The Faroese population is spread across most of the area; it was not until recent decades that significant urbanisation occurred. Industrialisation has been remarkably decentralised, and the area has therefore maintained quite a viable rural culture. Nevertheless, villages with poor harbour facilities have been the losers in the development from agriculture to fishing, and in the most peripheral agricultural areas, also known as [[Útoyggjar]] "Outer Islands", there are few young people. In recent decades, the village-based social structure has nevertheless been placed under pressure, giving way to a rise in interconnected "centres" that are better able to provide goods and services than the badly connected periphery. This means that shops and services are now relocating en masse from the villages into the centres, and slowly but steadily the Faroese population is concentrating in and around the centres.

In the 1990s, the government abandoned the old national policy of developing the villages (''Bygdamenning''), and instead began a process of regional development (''Økismenning''). The term "region" referred to the large islands of the Faroes. Nevertheless, the government was unable to press through the structural reform of merging small rural municipalities to create sustainable, decentralised entities that could drive forward regional development. As regional development has been difficult on the administrative level, the government has instead invested heavily in infrastructure, interconnecting the regions.

In general, it is becoming less valid to regard the Faroes as a society based on separate islands and regions. The huge investments in roads, bridges and sub-sea tunnels (see also [[Transport in the Faroe Islands]]) have bound the islands together, creating a coherent economic and cultural sphere that covers almost 90% of the population. From this perspective it is reasonable to regard the Faroes as a dispersed city or even to refer to it as the ''Faroese Network City''.{{citation needed|date=April 2008}}

===Language===
{{main|Faroese language}}
[[Faroese language|Faroese]] is spoken in the entire area as a first language. It is difficult to say exactly how many people worldwide speak the Faroese language, because many ethnic Faroese live in Denmark, and few who are born there return to the Faroes with their parents or as adults.

Faroese belongs to the [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] branch of [[Indo-European languages]]. Written Faroese (grammar and vocabulary) is most similar to [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] and to their ancestor [[Old Norse]], though the spoken language is closer to [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] dialects of [[Western Norway]]. Faroese is the first official language of the island while [[Danish language|Danish]], the second, is taught in schools and can be used by the Faroese government in public relations.<ref name="folang"/>

Faroese language policy provides for the active creation of new terms in Faroese suitable for modern life.

=== Religion ===
{{main|Religion in the Faroe Islands}}
According to the ''[[Færeyinga saga]]'', [[Sigmundur Brestisson]] brought Christianity to the islands in 999. However, archaeology at a site in Toftanes, [[Leirvík]], named Bønhústoftin (English: prayer-house ruin) and over a dozen slabs from Ólansgarður in the small island of [[Skúvoy]] which in the main display encircled linear and outline crosses, suggest that [[Celtic Christianity]] may have arrived at least 150 years earlier.<ref name="Bønhústoftin">{{Cite web |last=Hansen |first=Steffen Stummann |last2=John Sheehan |first2=John |title=The Leirvik Bønhústoftin and the Early Christianity of the Faroe Islands, and beyond |url=https://www.academia.edu/3123925 |access-date=3 October 2015 |publisher=Academia.edu}}</ref> The Faroe Islands' Church [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] was completed on 1 January 1540. According to official statistics from 2019, 79.7% of the Faroese population are members of the state church, the [[Church of the Faroe Islands]] (Fólkakirkjan), following a form of [[Lutheranism]].<ref>[https://statbank.hagstova.fo/pxweb/en/H2/H2__MM__MM03/atrud_prgj.px/ Parishes, 1st January (2000-2019)] Statistics Faroe Islands</ref> The Fólkakirkjan became an independent church in 2007; previously it had been a diocese within the [[Church of Denmark]]. Faroese members of the clergy who have had historical importance include [[Venceslaus Ulricus Hammershaimb]] (1819–1909), [[Fríðrikur Petersen]] (1853–1917) and, perhaps most significantly, [[Jákup Dahl]] (1878–1944), who had a great influence in ensuring that the [[Faroese language]] was spoken in the church instead of [[Danish language|Danish]]. Participation in churches is more prevalent among the Faroese population than among most other Scandinavians.

In the late 1820s, the Christian [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] religious movement, the [[Plymouth Brethren]], was established in England. In 1865, a member of this movement, [[William Gibson Sloan]], travelled to the Faroes from [[Shetland]]. At the turn of the 20th century, the Faroese Plymouth Brethren numbered thirty. Today, around 10% of the Faroese population are members of the Open Brethren community (''Brøðrasamkoman''). About 3% belong to the [[Charismatic Movement]]. There are several charismatic churches around the islands, the largest of which, called Keldan (The Spring), has about 200 to 300 members. About 2% belong to other Christian groups. The [[Adventism|Adventists]] operate a private school in Tórshavn. [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] also have four congregations with a total of 121 members. The Roman Catholic congregation has about 270 members and falls under the jurisdiction of Denmark's [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Copenhagen]]. The municipality of [[Tórshavn]] has an old [[Franciscans|Franciscan]] school.

There are also around fifteen followers of the [[Baháʼí Faith]] who meet at four different places. [[Islam]] is established through [[Ahmadiyya|Ahmadiyya Muslim Community]] in the Faroe Islands in 2010. Unlike [[Denmark]], [[Sweden]] and [[Iceland]] with [[Heathenry (new religious movement)#Forn Siðr|Forn Siðr]], the Faroes have no organised Heathen community.

The best-known church buildings in the Faroe Islands include [[Tórshavn Cathedral]], [[Olaf II of Norway]]'s Church and the [[Magnus Cathedral]] in [[Kirkjubøur]]; the Vesturkirkjan and the [[Catholic Church in the Faroe Islands#St Mary's Church Today|St. Mary's Church]], both of which are situated in Tórshavn; the church of [[Fámjin]]; the octagonal church in [[Haldórsvík]]; Christianskirkjan in [[Klaksvík]]; and also the two pictured here.

In 1948, Victor Danielsen (Plymouth Brethren) completed the first Bible translation into Faroese from different modern languages. Jacob Dahl and Kristian Osvald Viderø (Fólkakirkjan) completed the second translation in 1961. The latter was translated from the original Biblical languages ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and [[Greek language|Greek]]) into Faroese.

According to the 2011 Census, there were 33,018 Christians (95.44%), 23 Muslims (0.07%), 7 [[Hindu]]s (0.02%), 66 [[Buddhism|Buddhists]] (0.19%), 12 [[Jews]] (0.03%), 13 Baháʼís (0.04%), 3 [[Sikhism|Sikhs]] (0.01%), 149 others (0.43%), 85 with more than one belief (0.25%), and 1,397 with no religion (4.04%).<ref>{{Cite web |title=CS 10.1.2 Population by religious faith, educational attainment, occupation, country of birth, year of arrival in the country and place of usual residence. |url=http://www.hagstova.fo/en/statbank/census/2011/religion/religion-educaton-and-country-of-birth |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151002070910/http://www.hagstova.fo/en/statbank/census/2011/religion/religion-educaton-and-country-of-birth |archive-date=2 October 2015 |access-date=1 October 2015 |website=Statistics Faroe Islands}}</ref>

=== Education ===
{{main|Education in the Faroe Islands}}
The levels of education in the Faroe Islands are [[primary education|primary]], [[secondary education|secondary]] and [[higher education|higher]] education. Most institutions are funded by the state; there are few private schools in the country. Education is compulsory for 9 years between the ages of 7 and 16.<ref name="educationfaroe">{{Cite web |title=Education |url=http://www.faroeislands.fo/people-society/education-research/education/ |access-date=22 November 2014 |publisher=faroeislands.fo}}</ref>

Compulsory education consists of seven years of primary education and two years of lower secondary education; it is public, free of charge, provided by the respective municipalities, and is called the Fólkaskúli in Faroese. The Fólkaskúli also provides optional preschool education as well as the tenth year of education that is a prerequisite to get admitted to upper secondary education. Students that complete compulsory education are allowed to continue education in a [[vocational school]], where they can have job-specific training and education. Since the fishing industry is an important part of [[Economy of the Faroe Islands|country's economy]], maritime schools are an important part of Faroese education. Upon completion of the tenth year of Fólkaskúli, students can continue to upper secondary education which consists of several different types of schools. Higher education is offered at the [[University of the Faroe Islands]]; a part of Faroese youth moves abroad to pursue higher education, mainly in [[Denmark]]. Other forms of education comprise [[adult education]] and music schools. The structure of the Faroese educational system bears resemblances with its Danish counterpart.<ref name="educationfaroe" />

In the 12th century, education was provided by the [[Catholic Church in the Faroe Islands]].<ref name="Debes 2000">{{Cite book |last=Debes |first=Hans Jacob |title=Hin lærdi skúlin í Havn |publisher=Sprotin |year=2000 |isbn=99918-44-57-0 |pages=12–15 |language=fo |chapter=1}}<!--|accessdate=19 October 2015--></ref> The [[Church of Denmark]] took over education after the [[Reformation in Denmark–Norway and Holstein|Protestant Reformation]].<ref name="Debes 2000, chapter 2">{{Cite book |last=Debes |first=Hans Jacob |title=Hin lærdi skúlin í Havn |publisher=Sprotin |year=2000 |isbn=99918-44-57-0 |pages=34–35 |language=fo |chapter=2}}<!--|accessdate=19 October 2015--></ref>

Since 2000, the government has fostered new information technology and business projects to attract new investment. The introduction of [[Burger King]] in [[Tórshavn]] was widely publicized as a sign of the globalization of [[Culture of the Faroe Islands|Faroese culture]]. It remains to be seen whether these projects will succeed in broadening the islands' economic base. The islands have one of the lowest unemployment rates in Europe, but this should not necessarily be taken as a sign of a recovering economy, as many young students move to Denmark and other countries after leaving high school. This leaves a largely middle-aged and elderly population that may lack the skills and knowledge to fill newly developed positions on the Faroes. Nonetheless, in 2008 the Faroes were able to make a $52 million loan to [[Iceland]] to help with that country's banking woes.<ref name="NYT">{{Cite news |last=Lyall |first=Sarah |date=1 November 2008 |title=Iceland, Mired in Debt, Blames Britain for Woes |page=A6 |work=New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/02/world/europe/02iceland.html |access-date=1 November 2008}}</ref>

By road, the main islands are connected by bridges and tunnels. Government owned [[Strandfaraskip Landsins]] provides public bus and ferry service to the main towns and villages. There are no railways.

By air, [[Scandinavian Airlines]] and the government owned [[Atlantic Airways]] both have scheduled international flights to [[Vágar Airport]], the islands' only airport. Atlantic Airways also provides helicopter service to each of the islands. All civil aviation matters are controlled from the [[Civil Aviation Administration Denmark]].

By sea, [[Smyril Line]] operates a regular international passenger, car and freight service linking the Faroe Islands with [[Seyðisfjörður]], Iceland and [[Hirtshals]], Denmark.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Sailing Schedule 2018 |url=http://www.smyrilline.com/sailing-schedule/schedule-2018 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180306142308/http://www.smyrilline.com/sailing-schedule/schedule-2018 |archive-date=6 March 2018 |publisher=Smyril Line}}</ref>

[[File:New smyril 11.56.jpg|thumb|The new ferry [[MS Smyril|MS ''Smyril'']] enters the Faroe Islands at [[Krambatangi]] ferry port in [[Suðuroy]], 2005]]
Because of the rugged terrain, road transport in the Faroe Islands was not as extensive as in other parts of the world. This has now changed, and the infrastructure has been developed extensively. Some 80 percent of the population of the islands is connected by [[list of tunnels of the Faroe Islands|tunnels through the mountains and between the islands]], bridges and [[causeway]]s that link together the three largest islands and three other islands to the northeast. While the other two large islands to the south, Sandoy and Suðuroy, are connected to the main area with [[ferry|ferries]], the small islands Koltur and Stóra Dímun have no ferry connection, only a helicopter service. Other small islands—Mykines to the west, Kalsoy, Svínoy and Fugloy to the north, Hestur west of Streymoy, and Nólsoy east of Tórshavn—have smaller ferries and some of these islands also have a helicopter service.

In February 2014 all the political parties of the ''Løgting'' agreed on making two new subsea tunnels, one between Streymoy and Eysturoy (the [[Eysturoyartunnilin]]) and one between Streymoy and Sandoy ([[Sandoyartunnilin]]).

==Culture==
{{main|Culture of the Faroe Islands}}

The culture of the Faroe Islands has its roots in the [[Nordic countries|Nordic]] culture. The Faroe Islands were long isolated from the main cultural phases and movements that swept across parts of Europe. This means that they have maintained a great part of their traditional culture. The language spoken is [[Faroese language|Faroese]], which is one of three insular [[North Germanic languages]] descended from the [[Old Norse]] language spoken in Scandinavia in the [[Viking Age]], the others being [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] and the extinct [[Norn language|Norn]], which is thought to have been mutually intelligible with Faroese. Until the 15th century, Faroese had a similar orthography to Icelandic and [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], but after the Reformation in 1538, the ruling [[Norway|Norwegians]] outlawed its use in schools, churches and official documents. Although a rich spoken tradition survived, for 300 years the language was not written down. This means that all poems and stories were handed down orally. These works were split into the following divisions: sagnir (historical), ævintýr (stories) and [[kvæði]] (ballads), often set to music and the [[Middle Ages|medieval]] chain dance. These were eventually written down in the 19th century.

===Faroese literature===
{{main|Faroese literature}}
[[File:Faroe stamp 364 rasmussen and skardi.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Regin í Líð|Rasmus Rasmussen]], the writer who wrote the first novel in the [[Faroese language]] (poetical name: Regin í Líð) and [[Símun av Skarði]], the poet who wrote the Faroese national hymn]]
Faroese written literature has developed only in the past 100–200 years. This is mainly because of the islands' isolation, and also because the [[Faroese language]] was not written in a standardised way until 1890. The Danish language was also encouraged at the expense of Faroese. Nevertheless, the Faroes have produced several authors and poets. A rich centuries-old oral tradition of folk tales and Faroese folk songs accompanied the [[Faroese dance|Faroese chain dance]]. The people learned these songs and stories by heart, and told or sang them to each other, teaching the younger generations too. This kind of literature was gathered in the 19th century and early 20th century. The Faroese folk songs, in Faroese called ''kvæði'', are still in use although not so large-scale as earlier. Some of the Faroese folk songs have been used by the Faroese Viking metal band [[Týr (band)|Týr]], i.e., ''[[Ormurin Langi]]''.<ref>{{Cite web |date=31 August 2010 |title=Ormurin Langi: Týr: MP3 Downloads |url=https://www.amazon.com/Ormurin-Langi/dp/B0042GGCG4 |access-date=14 March 2014}}</ref>

The first [[List of novels written in Faroese|Faroese novel]], ''Bábelstornið'' by [[Regin í Líð]], was published in 1909; the second novel was published 18 years later. In the period 1930 to 1940 a writer from the village Skálavík on Sandoy island, [[Heðin Brú]], published three novels: ''Lognbrá'' (1930), ''Fastatøkur'' (1935) and ''Feðgar á ferð'' (English title: ''The old man and his sons'') (1940). ''Feðgar á ferð'' has been translated into several other languages. Martin Joensen from [[Sandvík]] wrote about life on Faroese fishing vessels; he published the novels ''Fiskimenn'' (1946)<ref>{{Cite web |title=Fiskimenn |url=http://snar.fo/skipan/utgavur/snarbook/fiskimenn/ |access-date=14 March 2014 |publisher=Snar.fo}}</ref> and ''Tað lýsir á landi'' (1952).

Well-known poets from the early 20th century are among others the two brothers from Tórshavn: [[Hans Andrias Djurhuus]] (1883–1951)<ref>{{Cite web |title=Hans Andrias Djurhuus (1883–1951) |url=http://snar.fo/index.php?id=3587 |access-date=14 March 2014 |publisher=Snar.fo}}</ref> and [[Janus Djurhuus]] (1881–1948),<ref>{{Cite web |title=Janus Djurhuus (1881–1948) |url=http://snar.fo/index.php?id=3588 |access-date=14 March 2014 |publisher=Snar.fo}}</ref> other well known poets from this period and the mid 20th century are [[Poul F.

[[Jens Pauli Heinesen]] (1932–2011), a school teacher from [[Sandavágur]], was the most productive Faroese novelist, he published 17 novels. [[Steinbjørn B. Jacobsen]] (1937–2012), a schoolteacher from [[Sandvík]], wrote short stories, plays, children's books and even novels. Most Faroese writers write in Faroese; two exceptions are [[William Heinesen]] (1900–91) and [[Jørgen-Frantz Jacobsen]] (1900–38).

Women were not so visible in the early Faroese literature except for [[Helena Patursson]] (1864–1916), but in the last decades of the 20th century and in the beginning of the 21st century female writers like [[Ebba Hentze]] (born 1933) wrote children's books, short stories, etc. [[Guðrið Helmsdal]] published the first modernistic collection of poems, ''Lýtt lot'', in 1963, which at the same time was the first collection of Faroese poems written by a woman.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Guðrið Helmsdal |url=http://www.ms.fo/?page_id=1099 |access-date=14 March 2014 |publisher=Ms.fo}}</ref> Her daughter, [[Rakel Helmsdal]] (born 1966), is also a writer, best known for her children's books, for which she has won several prizes and nominations. Other female writers are the novelists [[Oddvør Johansen]] (born 1941), [[Bergtóra Hanusardóttir]] (born 1946) and novelist/children's books writers [[Marianna Debes Dahl]] (born 1947), and [[Sólrun Michelsen]] (born 1948). Other modern Faroese writers include Gunnar Hoydal (born 1941), [[Hanus Kamban]] (born 1942), [[Jógvan Isaksen]] (born 1950), [[Jóanes Nielsen]] (born 1953), Tóroddur Poulsen and [[Carl Jóhan Jensen]] (born 1957). Some of these writers have been nominated for the [[Nordic Council's Literature Prize]] two to six times, but have never won it. The only Faroese writer who writes in Faroese who has won the prize is the poet [[Rói Patursson]] (born 1947), who won the prize in 1986 for ''Líkasum''.<ref>{{Cite web |title=1986 Rói Patursson, The Faroe Islands: Líkasum — Nordic cooperation |url=http://www.norden.org/en/nordic-council/nordic-council-prizes/nordisk-raads-litteraturpris/the-winners/1986 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140227074855/http://www.norden.org/en/nordic-council/nordic-council-prizes/nordisk-raads-litteraturpris/the-winners/1986/ |archive-date=27 February 2014 |access-date=14 March 2014 |publisher=Norden.org |df=dmy-all}}</ref> In 2007 the first

In the 21st century, some new writers had success in the Faroe Islands and abroad. [[Bárður Oskarsson]] (born 1972) is a children's book writer and illustrator; his books won prizes in the Faroes, Germany and the [[West Nordic Council's Children and Youth Literature Prize]] (2006).

[[Marjun Syderbø Kjelnæs]] (born 1974) had success with her first novel ''Skriva í sandin'' for teenagers; the book was awarded and nominated both in the Faroes and in other countries. She won the [[Nordic Children's Book Prize]] (2011) for this book, [[International Youth Library|White Raven Deutsche Jugendbibliothek]] (2011) and nominated the [[West Nordic Council's Children and Youth Literature Prize]] and the Children and Youth Literature Prize of the Nordic Council (2013).<ref>{{Cite web |title=Marjun Syderbø Kjelnæs |url=http://www.norden.org/da/nordisk-raad/nordisk-raads-priser/nordisk-raads-boerne-og-ungdomslitteraturpris/nominerede-2013/marjun-syderboe-kjelnaes |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110055635/http://www.norden.org/da/nordisk-raad/nordisk-raads-priser/nordisk-raads-boerne-og-ungdomslitteraturpris/nominerede-2013/marjun-syderboe-kjelnaes/ |archive-date=10 November 2013 |access-date=14 March 2014 |publisher=Norden.org |language=da |df=dmy-all}}</ref>

===Music===
{{main|Music of the Faroe Islands}}
The Faroe Islands have an active music scene, with live music being a regular part of the Islands' life and many Faroese being proficient at a number of instruments. Multiple Danish Music Award winner [[Teitur Lassen]] calls the Faroes home and is arguably the islands' most internationally well-known musical export.

The Islands have their own [[orchestra]] (the classical ensemble ''Aldubáran'') and many different choirs; the best-known of these is ''Havnarkórið''. The best-known local Faroese composers are [[Sunleif Rasmussen]] and [[Kristian Blak]], who is also head of the record company [[Tutl]]. The first Faroese opera was by Sunleif Rasmussen. It is entitled ''Í Óðamansgarði'' (The Madman's Garden) and was premiered on 12 October 2006 at the Nordic House. The opera is based on a short story by the writer [[William Heinesen]].

Young Faroese musicians who have gained much popularity recently are [[Eivør Pálsdóttir]], Anna Katrin Egilstrøð, Lena (Lena Andersen), [[Høgni Reistrup]], [[Høgni Lisberg]], HEIÐRIK ([[Heiðrik á Heygum]]), [[Guðrið Hansdóttir]] and [[Brandur Enni]].

Well-known bands include [[Týr (band)|Týr]], Gestir, [[Hamferð]], [[The Ghost (Faroese band)|The Ghost]], [[Boys in a Band]], ORKA, [[:fo:200 (rokkbólkur)|200]], Grandma's Basement, [[Sic (band)|SIC]], and the former band Clickhaze.

The festival of contemporary and classical music, ''Summartónar'', is held each summer. The [[G! Festival]] in [[Norðragøta]] in July and [[Summarfestivalurin]] in [[Klaksvík]] in August are both large, open-air music festivals for popular music with both local and international musicians participating. Havnar Jazzfelag was established 21 November 1975, and is still active. Currently Havnar Jazzfelag is arranging VetrarJazz amongst other jazz-festivals in The Faroe Islands.

===The Nordic House in the Faroe Islands===
The [[Nordic House in the Faroe Islands]] ({{lang-fo|Norðurlandahúsið}}) is the most important cultural institution in the Faroes. Its aim is to support and promote [[Scandinavia]]n and Faroese culture, locally and in the Nordic region. [[Erlendur Patursson]] (1913–86), Faroese member of the [[Nordic Council]], raised the idea of a Nordic cultural house in the Faroe Islands. A Nordic competition for architects was held in 1977, in which 158 architects participated. Winners were Ola Steen from [[Norway]] and Kolbrún Ragnarsdóttir from [[Iceland]]. By staying true to [[folklore]], the architects built the Nordic House to resemble an enchanted hill of [[elf|elves]]. The house opened in [[Tórshavn]] in 1983. The Nordic House is a cultural organization under the Nordic Council. The Nordic House is run by a steering committee of eight, of whom three are Faroese and five from other Nordic countries. There is also a local advisory body of fifteen members, representing Faroese cultural organizations. The House is managed by a director appointed by the steering committee for a four-year term.

===Traditional food===
{{main|Faroese cuisine}}
Traditional Faroese food is mainly based on meat, seafood and potatoes and uses few fresh vegetables. Mutton of the [[Faroe sheep]] is the basis of many meals, and one of the most popular treats is ''[[skerpikjøt]]'', well aged, wind-dried mutton, which is quite chewy. The drying shed, known as a ''hjallur'', is a standard feature in many Faroese homes, particularly in the small towns and villages. Other traditional foods are ''ræst kjøt'' (semi-dried mutton) and ''ræstur fiskur'', matured fish. Another Faroese specialty is ''[[tvøst og spik]]'', made from [[pilot whale]] meat and [[blubber]]. (A parallel meat/fat dish made with [[offal]] is ''[[garnatálg]]''.) The tradition of consuming meat and blubber from pilot whales arises from the fact that a single kill can provide many meals. Fresh fish also features strongly in the traditional local diet, as do [[seabird]]s, such as [[Faroese puffin]]s, and their eggs. Dried fish is also commonly eaten.
[[File:Dog as truck driver.jpg|thumb|right|Truck delivering [[Cadbury]] chocolate in the Faroe Islands]]
There are two breweries in the Faroe Islands. The first brewery is called [[Föroya Bjór]] and has produced beer since 1888 with exports mainly to Iceland and Denmark. The second brewery is called Okkara Bryggjarí and was founded in 2010. A local specialty is ''fredrikk'', a special brew made in [[Nólsoy]]. Production of hard alcohol such as [[snaps]] is forbidden in the Faroe Islands, hence the Faroese [[akvavit]] is produced abroad.

Since the friendly British occupation, the Faroese have been fond of British food, in particular [[fish and chips]] and British-style chocolate such as [[Cadbury Dairy Milk]], which is found in many of the island's shops.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Dixon |first=Rachel |date=2 September 2011 |title=Nordic holiday ideas |work=The Guardian |url=https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2011/sep/02/scandinavia-holidays-sweden-lapland}}</ref>

===Whaling===
{{main|Whaling in the Faroe Islands}}
[[File:Whaling in the Faroe Islands in August 2012.JPG|thumb|Boats driving a pod of pilot whales into a bay of [[Suðuroy]] in 2012]]
There are records of drive hunts in the Faroe Islands dating from 1584.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Brakes |first=Philippa |title=Troubled Waters: A Review of the Welfare Implications of Modern Whaling Activities |year=2004 |isbn=0-9547065-0-1 |editor-last=Philippa Brakes |page=7 |chapter=A background to whaling |editor-last2=Andrew Butterworth |editor-last3=Mark Simmonds |editor-last4=Philip Lymbery |chapter-url=http://www.wdcs.org/submissions_bin/troubledwaters.pdf}}</ref> [[Whaling in the Faroe Islands]] is regulated by Faroese authorities but not by the [[International Whaling Commission]] as there are disagreements about the commission's legal authority to regulate [[cetacea]]n hunts. Hundreds of [[long-finned pilot whale]]s (''Globicephala melaena'') could be killed in a year, mainly during the summer. The hunts, called ''grindadráp'' in Faroese, are non-commercial and are organized on a community level; anyone can participate. When a whale pod by chance is spotted near land the participating hunters first surround the pilot whales with a wide semicircle of boats and then slowly and quietly begin to drive the whales towards the chosen authorised bay.<ref name="Home">{{Cite web |title=Home |url=http://www.whaling.fo/en/home/}}</ref> When a pod of whales has been stranded the killing is begun.

Faroese animal welfare legislation, which also applies to whaling, requires that animals are killed as quickly and with as little suffering as possible. A regulation spinal lance is used to sever the [[spinal cord]], which also severs the major blood supply to the brain, ensuring both loss of consciousness and death within seconds. The spinal lance has been introduced as preferred standard equipment for killing pilot whales and has been shown to reduce killing time to 1–2 seconds.<ref name="Home" />

This "grindadráp" is legal and provides food for many people in the Faroe Islands.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Whales and whaling in the Faroe Islands |url=http://www.whaling.fo/thepilot.htm#Drivingthewhales |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090324072829/http://www.whaling.fo/thepilot.htm |archive-date=24 March 2009 |access-date=5 December 2006 |publisher=Faroese Government |df=dmy}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Why do whales and dolphins strand? |url=http://www.wdcs.org/dan/publishing.nsf/allweb/99E632F7502FCC3B802568F20048794C |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071031231236/http://www.wdcs.org/dan/publishing.nsf/allweb/99E632F7502FCC3B802568F20048794C |archive-date=31 October 2007 |access-date=5 December 2006 |publisher=[[WDCS]] |df=dmy}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |last=Chrismar |first=Nicole |date=28 July 2006 |title=Dolphins Hunted for Sport and Fertilizer |publisher=[[ABC News]] |url=https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/story?id=2248161&page=1 |access-date=21 July 2009}}</ref> However, a study has found whale meat and blubber to currently be contaminated with [[mercury (element)|mercury]] and not recommended for human consumption, as too much may cause such adverse health effects as birth defects of the nervous system, high blood pressure, damaged immune system, increased risk for developing [[Parkinson's disease]], [[hypertension]], [[arteriosclerosis]], and [[Diabetes mellitus type 2]]:

Some [[Faroese Islanders]] consider the hunt an important part of their culture and history.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2019-05-30 |title=Faroe Islands defend slaughter of whales as sea turns red with blood |url=https://metro.co.uk/2019/05/30/faroe-islands-defend-slaughter-whales-sea-turns-red-blood-9743755/ |access-date=2020-01-28 |website=Metro |language=en}}</ref> [[List of animal rights groups|Animal rights groups]], such as the [[Sea Shepherd Conservation Society]], criticize it as being cruel and unnecessary, since it is no longer necessary as a food source for the Faroese people.

The sustainability of the Faroese pilot whale hunt has been discussed, but with a long-term average catch of around 800 pilot whales on the Faroe Islands a year the hunt is not considered to have a significant impact on the pilot whale population. There are an estimated 128,000 pilot whales in the Northeast Atlantic, and Faroese whaling is therefore considered a sustainable catch by the Faroese government.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Inside the Grind: The Fight for Whale Hunting in the Faroe Islands – Motherboard |url=https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/the-fight-for-whale-hunting-in-the-faroe-islands-inside-the-grind |access-date=10 March 2017 |website=Motherboard}}</ref> Annual records of whale drives and strandings of pilot whales and other small cetaceans provide over 400 years of documentation, including statistics, and represents one of the most comprehensive historical records of wildlife utilization anywhere in the world.<ref name="Home" />

===Sports===
The Faroe Islands have competed in every biennial [[Island Games]] since they were established in 1985. The games were hosted by the islands in 1989 and Faroes won the [[2009 Island Games|Island Games in 2009]].
[[File:Pál Joensen 2014.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Pál Joensen]], Faroese swimmer]]
[[association football|Football]] is by far the biggest sports activity on the islands, with 7,000 registered players out of the whole population of 52,000. Ten football teams contest the [[Faroe Islands Premier League]], currently ranked 51st by [[Uefa league coefficient|UEFA's League coefficient]]. The Faroe Islands are a full member of [[UEFA]] and the [[Faroe Islands national football team]] competes in the [[UEFA European Football Championship]] qualifiers. The country is also a full member of [[FIFA]] and therefore the Faroe Islands football team also competes in the [[FIFA World Cup]] qualifiers. The country won its [[List of Faroe Islands national football team results|first ever competitive match]] when the team defeated [[Austria national football team|Austria]] 1–0 in a UEFA Euro 1992 qualifying.

The nation's biggest success in football came in 2014 after defeating Greece 1–0, a result that was considered "the biggest shock of all time" in football<ref>{{Cite web |last=John Ashdown |date=19 November 2014 |title=Is the Faroe Islands' win over Greece the biggest shock of all time? |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/nov/19/the-knowledge-faroe-islands-biggest-shock-ever |access-date=10 December 2014 |website=The Guardian}}</ref> thanks to a 169-place distance between the teams in the [[FIFA World Rankings]] when the match was played.

[[IHF Emerging Nations Championship]] has been played twice, starting in 2015, and [[Faroe Islands national handball team]] has won both editions.

The Faroe Islands are a full member of [[FINA]] and compete under their own flag at World Championships, European Championships and World Cup events. The Faroese swimmer [[Pál Joensen]] (born 1990) won a bronze medal at the [[2012 FINA World Swimming Championships (25 m)]]<ref>{{Cite web |last=Emil Lisberg Jacobsen |title=Pál Joensen frá bronsu til silvur og aftur til bronsu |url=http://sportal.fo/pal+joensen+fra+bronsu+til+silvur+og+aftur+til+bronsu.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222040601/http://sportal.fo/pal+joensen+fra+bronsu+til+silvur+og+aftur+til+bronsu.html |archive-date=22 February 2014 |access-date=14 March 2014 |publisher=Sportal.fo}}</ref> and four silver medals at the European Championships ([[2010 European Aquatics Championships|2010]], [[2013 European Short Course Swimming Championships|2013]] and [[2014 European Aquatics Championships|2014]]),<ref>{{Cite web |title=Færøske Pál indleder ny OL-satsning med EM-sølv |url=http://politiken.dk/sport/svomning/ECE2371848/faeroeske-pl-indleder-ny-ol-satsning-med-em-soelv/}}</ref> all medals won in the men's longest and second longest distance the 1500 and 800 metre freestyle, short and long course. The Faroe Islands also compete in the [[Faroe Islands at the Paralympics|Paralympics]] and have won 1 gold, 7 silver, and 5 bronze medals since the [[1984 Summer Paralympics]].

Two Faroese athletes have competed at the Olympics, but under the [[Denmark at the Olympics|Danish flag]], since the Olympic Committee does not allow the Faroe Islands to compete under its own flag. The two Faroese who have competed are the swimmer [[Pál Joensen]] in 2012 and the rower [[Katrin Olsen]]. She competed at the [[Rowing at the 2008 Summer Olympics|2008 Summer Olympics]] in double sculler light weight together with [[Juliane Rasmussen]]. Another Faroese rower, who is a member of the Danish National rowing team, is [[Sverri Sandberg Nielsen]], who currently competes in single sculler, heavy weight, he has also competed in double sculler.

The Faroe Islands applied to the IOC for full Faroese membership in 1984, but {{As of|2017|lc=y}} the Faroe Islands are still not a member of the IOC. At the [[2015 European Games]] in Baku, Azerbaijan, the Faroe Islands were not allowed to compete under the Faroese flag; they were, however, allowed to compete under the [[Ligue Européenne de Natation]] flag. Before this, the Faroese prime minister [[Kaj Leo Holm Johannesen]] had a meeting with the IOC president [[Thomas Bach]] in Lausanne on 21 May 2015 to discuss Faroese membership in the IOC.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Løgmaður á fund um olympiskan limaskap |url=http://www.in.fo/news-detail/news/loegmadur-a-fund-um-olympiskan-limaskap/}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=The Prime Minister to meet with the International Olympic Committee |url=http://arcticjournal.com/press-releases/1387/prime-minister-meet-international-olympic-committee |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403072606/http://arcticjournal.com/press-releases/1387/prime-minister-meet-international-olympic-committee |archive-date=3 April 2015 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>

===Clothing===
{{distinguish|Fair Isle (technique)}}
Faroese handicrafts are mainly based on materials available to local villages—mainly wool. Garments include sweaters, scarves, and gloves. Faroese jumpers have distinct Nordic patterns; each village has some regional variations handed down from mother to daughter. There has recently been a strong revival of interest in Faroese knitting, with young people knitting and wearing updated versions of old patterns emphasized by strong colours and bold patterns. This appears to be a reaction to the loss of traditional lifestyles, and as a way to maintain and assert cultural tradition in a rapidly-changing society. Many young people study and move abroad, and this helps them maintain cultural links with their specific Faroese heritage.

There has also been a great interest in Faroese [[sweater]]s<ref>{{Cite news |last=Townsend |first=Mark |date=9 August 2014 |title=Sarah Lund's jumper is exhibit A in a legal battle |work=The Guardian |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/10/sarah-lund-jumper-copyright-the-killing}}</ref> from the TV series ''[[The Killing (Danish TV series)|The Killing]]'', where the main actress (Detective Inspector Sarah Lund, played by [[Sofie Gråbøl]]) wears Faroese sweaters.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Hall |first=James |date=2012-09-10 |title=Fans of 'The Killing' can now knit their own Sarah Lund jumper |language=en-GB |work=The Daily Telegraph |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/9533226/Fans-of-The-Killing-can-now-knit-their-own-Sarah-Lund-jumper.html |access-date=2020-01-28 |issn=0307-1235}}</ref>

[[Lace knitting]] is a traditional handicraft. The most distinctive trait of [[Faroese lace shawls]] is the centre-back [[gusset]] shaping. Each shawl consists of two triangular side panels, a trapezoid-shaped back gusset, an edge treatment, and usually shoulder shaping. These are worn by all generations of women, particularly as part of the traditional Faroese costume as an overgarment.

[[File:Faroese folk dance club from vagar.jpg|thumb|left|Faroese folk dancers, some of them in national costume]]
The traditional Faroese national dress is also a local handicraft that people spend a lot of time, money, and effort to assemble. It is worn at weddings and traditional dancing events, and on feast days. The cultural significance of the garment should not be underestimated, both as an expression of local and national identity and a passing on and reinforcing of traditional skills that bind local communities together.

A young Faroese person is normally handed down a set of children's Faroese clothes that have passed from generation to generation. Children are [[confirmed]] at age 14, and normally start to collect the pieces to make an adult outfit, which is considered as a rite of passage. Traditionally the aim would have been to complete the outfit by the time a young person was ready to marry and wear the clothes at the ceremony—though it is mainly only men who do this now.

Each piece is intricately hand-knitted, dyed, woven or embroidered to the specifications of the wearer. For example, the man's waistcoat is put together by hand in bright blue, red or black fine wool. The front is then intricately embroidered with colourful silk threads, often by a female relative. The motifs are often local Faroese flowers or herbs. After this, a row of Faroese-made solid silver buttons are sewn on the outfit.

Women wear embroidered silk, cotton or wool shawls and pinafores that can take months to weave or embroider with local flora and fauna. They are also adorned with a handwoven black and red ankle-length skirt, knitted black and red jumper, a velvet belt, and black 18th century style shoes with silver buckles. The outfit is held together by a row of solid silver buttons, silver chains and locally-made silver brooches and belt buckles, often fashioned with Viking style motifs.

Both men's and women's national dress are extremely costly and can take many years to assemble. Women in the family often work together to assemble the outfits, including knitting the close-fitting jumpers, weaving and embroidering, sewing and assembling the national dress.

This tradition binds together families, passes on traditional crafts, and reinforces the Faroese culture of traditional village life in the context of a modern society.

===Public holidays===
[[File:Føroysk fløgg á Ólavsøku.jpg|thumb|The annual ''Ólavsøka'' parade on 28 July 2005.]]
{{see also|Public holidays in Denmark}}
''[[Ólavsøka]]'' is on 29 July; it commemorates the death of [[Saint Olaf]]. The celebrations are held in Tórshavn, starting on the evening of the 28th and continuing until the 31st. 28 July is a half working day for the members of some of the labour unions, while Ólavsøkudagur (St Olaf's Day) on 29 July is a full holiday for most but not all union members.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Industry.fo, Frídagar um Ólavsøkuna |url=http://www.industry.fo/Default.aspx?ID=32&Action=1&NewsId=577&PID=4786 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140505104952/http://www.industry.fo/Default.aspx?ID=32&Action=1&NewsId=577&PID=4786 |archive-date=5 May 2014}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Nordlysid.fo |url=http://www.nordlysid.fo.php53-6.dfw1-1.websitetestlink.com/arbeida+langan+dag+a+kosini+olavsokudag.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141223084310/http://www.nordlysid.fo.php53-6.dfw1-1.websitetestlink.com/arbeida+langan+dag+a+kosini+olavsokudag.html |archive-date=23 December 2014 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>

The official celebration starts on the 29th, with the opening of the [[Faroese Parliament]], a custom that dates back 900 years.<ref>Schei, Kjørsvik Liv and Moberg, Gunnie. 1991. ''The Faroe Islands''. {{ISBN|0-7195-5009-2}}</ref> This begins with a service held in [[Tórshavn Cathedral]]; all members of parliament as well as civil and church officials walk to the cathedral in a procession. All of the parish ministers take turns giving the sermon. After the service, the procession returns to the parliament for the opening ceremony.

Other celebrations are marked by different kinds of sports competitions, the rowing competition (in Tórshavn Harbour) being the most popular, art exhibitions, pop concerts, and the famous [[Faroese dance]] in Sjónleikarhúsið and on Vaglið outdoor singing on 29 July (continuing after midnight on 30 July). The celebrations have many facets, and only a few are mentioned here.

Many people also mark the occasion by wearing the national Faroese dress.
