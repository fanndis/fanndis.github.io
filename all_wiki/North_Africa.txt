'''North Africa''' is a region encompassing the northern portion of the [[Africa]]n continent. There is no singularly accepted scope for the region, and it is sometimes defined as stretching from the Atlantic shores of [[Mauritania]] in the west, to [[Egypt]]'s [[Suez Canal]] and the [[Red Sea]] in the east. Others{{Like whom?|date=January 2019}} have limited it to the countries of [[Algeria]], [[Morocco]], and [[Tunisia]], a region that was known by the French during colonial times as "Afrique du Nord" and is known by Arabs as the [[Maghreb]] ("West", ''The western part of Arab World''). The most commonly accepted definition includes [[Morocco]], [[Algeria]], [[Tunisia]], [[Libya]], [[Egypt]], and [[Sudan]], the 6 countries that shape the top North of the African continent. Meanwhile, "North Africa", particularly when used in the term '''[[Middle East and North Africa]]''' (MENA), often refers only to the countries of the [[Maghreb]].

North Africa includes a number of Spanish and Portuguese possessions, [[Plazas de soberanía]], [[Ceuta]] and [[Melilla]] and the [[Canary Islands]] and [[Madeira]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/figure/United-Nations-definition-of-African-Regions-West-Northern-Central-East-and-Southern_fig3_267971678|title=Figure 5: United Nations definition of African Regions: West, Northern,...|website=ResearchGate.net|access-date=10 August 2018}}</ref> The countries of North Africa share a common ethnic, cultural and linguistic identity with the Middle East or [[West Asia]], and is unique to this region as compared to [[Sub-Saharan Africa]]. Northwest Africa has been inhabited by [[Berbers]] since the beginning of recorded history, while the eastern part of North Africa has been home to the [[Egyptians]].<ref>{{Citation|url=http://cairoscene.com/Buzz/National-Geographic-s-DNA-Analysis-Proves-Egyptians-Are-Only-17-Arab|title=National Geographic Geno Project: Egyptians are North Africans}}</ref> Between the A.D. 600s and 1000s, Arabs from the [[Middle East]] swept across the region in a wave of [[Conquest (military)|Muslim conquest]]. These peoples, physically quite similar, formed a single population in many areas, as Berbers and Egyptians merged into [[Arabic culture|Arabic]] and [[Muslim culture]]. This process of Arabization and Islamization has defined the cultural landscape of North Africa ever since.

The distinction between North Africa, the [[Sahel]] and the rest of the [[Africa|continent]] is as follows: 
{{Quote|text=
Nineteenth century European [[Exploration|explorers]], attracted by the accounts of Ancient geographers or [[Arab geographers]] of the classical period, followed the routes by the nomadic people of the vast "empty" space. They documented the names of the stopping places they discovered or rediscovered, described landscapes, took a few climate measurements and gathered rock samples. Gradually, a map began to fill in the white blotch.

The [[Sahara]] and the [[Sahel]] entered the geographic corpus by way of naturalist explorers because aridity is the feature that circumscribes the boundaries of the ''[[ecumene]]''. &nbsp;The map details included topographical relief and location of watering holes crucial to long crossings. The Arabic word "Sahel" (shore) and "Sahara" (desert) made its entry into the vocabulary of geography.

Latitudinally, the "slopes" of the arid desert, devoid of continuous human habitation, descend in step-like fashion toward the northern and southern edges of the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] that opens to Europe and the Sahel that opens to "Trab al Sudan." Longitudinally, a uniform grid divides the central desert then shrinks back toward the [[Atlantic Ocean]] and the [[Red Sea]]. Gradually, the Sahara-Sahel is further divided into a total of twenty sub-areas: central, northern, southern, western, eastern, etc.

In this way, "standard" geography has determined aridity to be the boundary of the ''ecumene''. It identifies settlements based on visible activity without regard for social or political organizations of space in vast, purportedly "empty" areas. It gives only cursory acknowledgement to what makes Saharan geography, and for that matter, world geography unique: mobility and the routes by which it flows.

The [[Sahel]] or "African Transition Zone" has been affected by many formative epochs in North African history ranging from [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] occupation to the Arab-Berber control of the [[Al-Andalus|Andalus]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/tarikhalsudan00sadauoft/page/n6|title=Tarikh es soudan|last=es-Sadi|first=Abderrahman|publisher=Paris E.

==Geography==
North Africa has three main geographic features: the [[Sahara]] desert in the south, the [[Atlas Mountains]] in the west, and the [[Nile|Nile River]] and delta in the east. The [[Atlas Mountains]] extend across much of northern [[Algeria]], [[Morocco]] and [[Tunisia]]. These mountains are part of the [[fold mountains|fold mountain]] system that also runs through much of [[Southern Europe]]. They recede to the south and east, becoming a [[steppe]] landscape before meeting the [[Sahara]] desert, which covers more than 75 percent of the region. The tallest peaks are in the High Atlas range in south-central Morocco, which has many snow-capped peaks.

South of the Atlas Mountains is the dry and barren expanse of the [[Sahara]] desert, which is the largest sand desert in the world.<ref name="geology.com">{{cite web|url=http://geology.com/records/largest-desert.shtml|title=Largest Desert in the World|access-date=30 December 2011}}</ref>  In places the desert is cut by irregular watercourses called wadis—streams that flow only after rainfalls but are usually dry. The Sahara's major landforms include ergs, large seas of sand that sometimes form into huge dunes; the hammada, a level rocky plateau without soil or sand; and the reg, a level plain of gravel or small stones. The Sahara covers the southern part of Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia, and most of Libya. Only two regions of Libya are outside the desert: [[Tripolitania]] in the northwest and [[Cyrenaica]] in the northeast. Most of Egypt is also desert, with the exception of the Nile River and the irrigated land along its banks. The Nile Valley forms a narrow fertile thread that runs along the length of the country.

Sheltered valleys in the [[Atlas Mountains]], the Nile Valley and [[Nile Delta|Delta]], and the Mediterranean coast are the main sources of fertile farming land. A wide variety of valuable crops including cereals, rice and cotton, and woods such as cedar and cork, are grown. Typical Mediterranean crops, such as olives, figs, dates and citrus fruits, also thrive in these areas. The Nile Valley is particularly fertile and most of the population in [[Egypt]] live close to the river. Elsewhere, irrigation is essential to improve crop yields on the desert margins.

Variously the [[Sudan]] and [[Western Sahara]] are considered to be part of the region [[United Nations geoscheme for Africa#Northern Africa|by the United Nations]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://unstats.un.org/unsd/methodology/m49/#geo-regions|title=UNSD — Methodology|first=United Nations Statistics|last=Division|website=unstats.un.org}}</ref> while Western Sahara and [[Mauritania]] (but not Sudan) are included [[Regions of the African Union#North|by the African Union]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://au.int/en/organs/assembly|title=The Assembly – African Union|website=au.int}}</ref> In general geopolitical and business usage, as for example with the World Bank, North Africa is often grouped with the [[Middle East]] under the [[acronym]] [[MENA]] ("Middle East and North Africa") and sometimes in American governmental usage the [[geopolitical]] term [[Greater Middle East]]. Similarly, the traditional Arabic [[toponym]] [[Maghreb]] (meaning "the West") is commonly used to mean the African part of the [[Arab World]], though usually with the exclusion of Egypt.

The inhabitants of the Spanish [[Canary Islands]] are of mixed Spanish and North African Berber ancestry, and the people of [[Malta]] are of North African ancestry and speak a [[Maltese language|derivative of Arabic]]. However, these areas are not generally considered part of North Africa, but rather Southern Europe, due to their European-based cultures and religion.

The inhabitants of North Africa are roughly divided in a manner corresponding to the principal geographic regions of North Africa: the Maghreb, the [[Nile]] valley, and the [[Sahel]]. The Maghreb or western North Africa on the whole is believed to have been inhabited by [[Berbers]] since at least 10,000 B.C.,<ref>Hsain Ilahiane, [https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0810864908 Historical Dictionary of the Berbers] (Imazighen)(2006), p. 112</ref> while the eastern part of North Africa or the [[Nile Valley]] has mainly been home to the [[Egyptians]]. Ancient Egyptians record extensive contact in their Western desert with people that appear to have been Berber or proto-Berber. As the [[Tassili n'Ajjer]] and other rock art findings in the Sahara have shown, the [[Sahara]] also hosted various populations before its rapid [[desertification]] in 3500 B.C and even today continues to host small populations of [[Tuareg people|nomadic trans-Saharan peoples]].

In the eleventh century, the [[Banu Hilal]] invaded the North African plains and plateaus, but not the mountainous areas such as the [[Tell Atlas]] range, the [[Rif]] or the [[Aurès Mountains]] and brought with them [[Hilalian dialects]] of [[Arabic]], which over the centuries have been in significant contact with other languages, including the [[languages of Europe]].

The official languages in the countries making up the Maghreb are [[Tamazight]] which is also known as Berber, and Arabic and French as administrative languages.

The people of the Maghreb and the Sahara regions speak [[Berber languages]] and several [[varieties of Arabic]] and almost exclusively follow Islam. The Arabic and Berber languages are distantly related, both being members of the [[Afroasiatic languages|Afroasiatic language family]]. The [[Tuareg languages|Tuareg]] Berber languages are notably more conservative than those of the coastal cities.

Over the years, Berbers have been influenced by contact with other cultures: [[Greeks]], [[Phoenicia]]ns, [[Egyptians]], [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], [[Vandals]], [[Arabs]], [[Ethnic groups in Europe|Europeans]] and [[Africa]]ns. The cultures of the Maghreb and the Sahara therefore combine indigenous Berber, Arab and elements from neighboring parts of Africa and beyond. In the Sahara, the distinction between sedentary [[oasis]] inhabitants and nomadic [[Bedouin]]s and [[Tuareg people|Tuaregs]] is particularly marked. 
[[File:Flickr - stringer bel - Ait Benhaddou.jpg|thumb|The [[kasbah]] of [[Aït Benhaddou]] in Morocco]]
The diverse peoples of North Africa are usually categorized along ethno-linguistic lines. In the Maghreb, where Arab and Berber identities are often integrated, these lines can be blurred. Some Berber-speaking North Africans may identify as "Arab" depending on the social and political circumstances, although substantial numbers of Berbers (or ''Amazighen'') have retained a distinct cultural identity which in the 20th century has been expressed as a clear ethnic identification with Berber history and language. Arabic-speaking Northwest Africans, regardless of ethnic background, often identify with Arab history and culture and may share a common vision with other Arabs. This, however, may or may not exclude pride in and identification with Berber and/or other parts of their heritage. Berber political and cultural activists for their part, often referred to as [[Berberism|Berberists]], may view all Northwest Africans as principally Berber, whether they are primarily Berber- or Arabic-speaking.

[[Egyptians]] over the centuries have shifted their language from [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]] (in its late form, [[Coptic language|varieties of Coptic]]) to modern [[Egyptian Arabic]] while retaining a sense of national identity that has historically set them apart from other people in the region. Most Egyptians are [[Sunni Islam|Sunni Muslim]], although there is a significant minority of Coptic Christians.

The Maghreb formerly had a significant Jewish population, almost all of whom emigrated to France or [[Israel]] when the North African nations gained independence. Prior to the modern establishment of Israel, there were about 600,000–700,000 Jews in Northern Africa, including both [[Sephardi Jews]] (refugees from France, Spain and Portugal from the Renaissance era) as well as indigenous [[Mizrahi Jews]]. Today, less than fifteen thousand remain in the region, almost all in Morocco and Tunisia, and are mostly part of a French-speaking urban elite. (See [[Jewish exodus from Arab and Muslim countries]].)

Due to the [[recent African origin of modern humans]], the history of Prehistoric North Africa is important to the understanding of pre-hominid and early modern human history in Africa.
Some researchers have postulated that North Africa rather than [[East Africa]] served as the exit point for the modern humans who first trekked out of the continent in the [[recent African origin of modern humans|Out of Africa]] migration.<ref>{{Cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.331.6013.20|pmid=21212332|title=Was North Africa the Launch Pad for Modern Human Migrations?|journal=Science|volume=331|issue=6013|pages=20–23|date=2011-01-07|last1=Balter|first1=Michael|bibcode=2011Sci...331...20B}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal | url=http://www.cell.com/AJHG/fulltext/S0002-9297%2811%2900164-9# | doi=10.1016/j.ajhg.2011.05.002| pmid=21601174| pmc=3113241| title=A Revised Root for the Human y Chromosomal Phylogenetic Tree: The Origin of Patrilineal Diversity in Africa| journal=The American Journal of Human Genetics| volume=88| issue=6| pages=814–818| year=2011| last1=Cruciani| first1=Fulvio| last2=Trombetta| first2=Beniamino| last3=Massaia| first3=Andrea| last4=Destro-Bisol| first4=Giovanni| last5=Sellitto| first5=Daniele| last6=Scozzari| first6=Rosaria}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |doi=10.1073/pnas.0700747104|pmid=17372199|pmc=1828706|title=Earliest evidence of modern human life history in North African early Homo sapiens|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|volume=104|issue=15|pages=6128–6133|date=2007-04-10|last1=Hublin|first1=Jean-Jacques|last2=Boutakiout|first2=Mohamed|last3=Eggins|first3=Stephen|last4=Grün|first4=Rainer|last5=Reid|first5=Donald J.|last6=Tafforeau|first6=Paul|last7=Smith|first7=Tanya M.|bibcode=2007PNAS..104.6128S}}</ref>.

Recent finds in Jebel Irhoud in Morocco have been found to contain some of the oldest ''Homo sapiens'' remains; This suggests that, rather than arising only in [[East Africa]] around 200,000 years ago, early ''Homo sapiens'' may already have been present across the length of Africa 100,000 years earlier.

The cave paintings found at Tassili n'Ajjer, north of Tamanrasset, Algeria, and at other locations depict vibrant and vivid scenes of everyday life in central North Africa during the Neolithic Subpluvial period (about 8000 to 4000 BCE). Some parts of North Africa began to participate in the Neolithic revolution in the 6th millennium BCE, just before the rapid desertification of the Sahara around 3500 B.C. largely due to a tilt in the Earth's orbit.<ref name="sciencedaily.com">{{cite web|url=https://www.nature.com/scitable/knowledge/library/green-sahara-african-humid-periods-paced-by-82884405/|title=Green Sahara: African humid periods paced by Earth's orbital changes|date=1999-07-12|website=Science Daily|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029191042/https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/1999/07/990712080500.htm|archive-date=2013-10-29}}</ref> It was during this period that domesticated plants and animals were introduced in the region, spreading from the north and east to the southwest.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kuper|first=Rudolf|title=Climate-Controlled Holocene Occupation in the Sahara: Motor of Africa's Evolution|journal=Science|year=2006|volume=313|issue=5788|pages=803–708|doi=10.1126/science.1130989|pmid=16857900|bibcode=2006Sci...313..803K|s2cid=20003260}}</ref> There has been an inferred connection between areas of rapid drying and the introduction of livestock in which the natural (orbital) aridification was amplified by the spread of shrubs and open land due to grazing.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wright|first=David|title=Humans as Agents in the Termination of the African Humid Period|journal=Frontiers in Earth Science|year=2017|volume=5|pages=https://doi.org/10.3389/feart.2017.00004|doi=10.3389/feart.2017.00004|bibcode=2017FrEaS...5....4W|doi-access=free}}</ref> Nevertheless, changes in northern Africa's ecology after 3500 BCE provided the backdrop for the formation of dynastic civilizations and the construction of monumental architecture such as the [[Giza pyramid complex|Pyramids of Giza]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gatto|first=Maria|title=Holocene supra-regional environmental changes as trigger for major socio-cultural processes in northeastern Africa and the Sahara|journal=African Archaeological Review|year=2015|volume=32|issue=2|pages=301–333|doi=10.1007/s10437-015-9191-x|s2cid=126834892}}</ref>

===Antiquity and ancient Rome===
{{Main|History of North Africa#Classical period}}
[[File:Septimius Severus Glyptothek Munich 357.jpg|thumb|upright|The first [[Roman Empire|Roman]] emperor native to North Africa was [[Septimius Severus]], born in Leptis Magna in present-day Libya.]]
The most notable nations of antiquity in western North Africa are [[Carthage]] and [[Numidia]]. The Phoenicians colonized much of North Africa including Carthage and parts of present-day Morocco (including [[Chellah]], [[Essaouira]] and [[Volubilis]]<ref>{{cite web|author=C. Michael Hogan |url=http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=14906 |title=Volubilis – Ancient Village or Settlement in Morocco |publisher=The Megalithic Portal |date=December 18, 2007 |access-date=2010-05-23}}</ref>). The Carthaginians were of [[Phoenicia]]n origin, with the Roman myth of their origin being that [[Dido]], a Phoenician princess, was granted land by a local ruler based on how much land she could cover with a piece of cowhide. She ingeniously devised a method to extend the cowhide to a high proportion, thus gaining a large territory. She was also rejected by the [[Troy|Trojan]] prince [[Aeneas]] according to [[Virgil]], thus creating a historical enmity between Carthage and [[Rome]], as Aeneas would eventually lay the foundations for Rome. [[Ancient Carthage]] was a commercial power and had a strong navy, but relied on mercenaries for land soldiers. The Carthaginians developed an empire in the [[Iberian Peninsula]] and [[Sicily]], the latter being the cause of [[First Punic War]] with the [[Roman Republic|Romans]].

Over a hundred years and more, all Carthaginian territory was eventually conquered by the Romans, resulting in the Carthaginian North African territories becoming the [[Africa (Roman province)|Roman province of Africa]] in 146 B.C.<ref>''The Punic Wars 264–146 BC'', by Nigel Bagnall</ref> This led to tension and eventually [[war|conflict]] between [[Numidia]] and Rome. The Numidian wars are notable for launching the careers of both [[Gaius Marius]], and [[Sulla]], and stretching the constitutional burden of the Roman republic as Marius required a professional army, something previously contrary to Roman values, to overcome the talented [[military]] leader [[Jugurtha]].<ref>[[Sallust]], ''De Bello Iugurthino''</ref>

North Africa remained a part of the Roman Empire, which produced many notable citizens such as [[Augustine of Hippo]], until incompetent leadership from Roman commanders in the early fifth century allowed the [[Germanic peoples]], the [[Vandals]], to cross the [[Strait of Gibraltar]], whereupon they overcame the fickle Roman defense. The loss of North Africa is considered a pinnacle point in the fall of the Western Roman Empire as Africa had previously been an important grain province that maintained Roman prosperity despite the barbarian incursions, and the wealth required to create new armies. The issue of regaining North Africa became paramount to the Western Empire, but was frustrated by Vandal victories. The focus of Roman energy had to be on the emerging threat of the [[Huns]]. In 468 AD, the Romans made one last serious attempt to invade North Africa but were repelled. This perhaps marks the point of terminal decline for the [[Western Roman Empire]]. The last Roman emperor was deposed in 476 by the [[Herules|Heruli]] general [[Odoacer]]. [[Trade route]]s between [[Europe]] and North Africa remained intact until the coming of Islam. Some Berbers were members of the [[Early African Church]] (but evolved their own [[Donatism|Donatist doctrine]]),<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/specials/1624_story_of_africa/page66.shtml The Berbers] BBC World Service: The Story of Africa</ref> some were [[Berber Jews]], and some adhered to [[traditional Berber religion]]. [[African pope]] [[Pope Victor I|Victor I]] served during the reign of Roman emperor [[Septimius Severus]]

The [[early Muslim conquests]] included North Africa by 640. By 700, most of North Africa had come under Muslim rule. Indigenous Berbers subsequently started to form their own polities in response in places such as [[Fez, Morocco|Fez]] and [[Sijilmasa]]. In the eleventh century, a reformist movement made up of members that called themselves the [[Almoravid dynasty]] expanded south into [[Sub-Saharan Africa]].

North Africa's populous and flourishing civilization collapsed after exhausting its resources in internal fighting and suffering devastation from the invasion of the [[Banu Sulaym]] and [[Banu Hilal]]. Ibn Khaldun noted that the lands ravaged by Banu Hilal invaders had become completely arid desert.<ref>[http://www.galtoninstitute.org.uk/Newsletters/GINL9603/PopCrises3.htm Populations Crises and Population Cycles] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130527170154/http://www.galtoninstitute.org.uk/Newsletters/GINL9603/PopCrises3.htm |date=2013-05-27 }}, Claire Russell and W.M.S.

After the [[Middle Ages]] the area was loosely under the control of the [[Ottoman Empire]], except [[Morocco]]. The [[Spanish Empire]] conquered several coastal cities between the 16th and 18th centuries. After the 19th century, the imperial and colonial presence of [[French colonial empire|France]], [[British Empire|the United Kingdom]], [[Spanish Empire|Spain]] and [[Italy]] left the entirety of the region under one form of European occupation.

In [[World War II]] from 1940 to 1943 the area was the setting for the [[North African Campaign]]. During the 1950s and 1960s all of the North African states gained independence. There remains a dispute over [[Western Sahara]] between [[Morocco]] and the [[Algeria]]n-backed [[Polisario Front]].

In 2010–2011 massive protests swept the region leading to the overthrow of the governments in Tunisia and Egypt, as well as civil war in Libya. Large protests also occurred in Algeria and Morocco to a lesser extent. Many hundreds died in the uprisings. This uprising is commonly referred to as the "Arab spring".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://english.aljazeera.net/indepth/features/2011/02/201122164254698620.html |title=In search of an African revolution |first=Azad |last=Essa |publisher=Al Jazeera |date=February 21, 2011}}</ref>

The economies of [[Algeria]] and [[Libya]] were transformed by the discovery of oil and natural gas reserves in the deserts. [[Morocco]]'s major exports are [[phosphate]]s and agricultural produce, and as in [[Egypt]] and [[Tunisia]], the tourist industry is essential to the economy. [[Egypt]] has the most varied industrial base, importing technology to develop electronics and engineering industries, and maintaining the reputation of its high-quality cotton textiles.

Oil rigs are scattered throughout the deserts of [[Libya]] and [[Algeria]]. Libyan oil is especially prized because of its low [[sulfur]] content, which means it produces much less pollution than other fuel oils.
