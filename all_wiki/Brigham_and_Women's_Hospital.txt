'''Brigham and Women's Hospital''' ('''BWH''') is the second largest [[teaching hospital]] of [[Harvard Medical School]] and the largest hospital in the [[Longwood Medical and Academic Area|Longwood Medical Area]] in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]]. Along with [[Massachusetts General Hospital]], it is one of the two founding members of [[Mass General Brigham]], the largest healthcare provider in Massachusetts. [[Elizabeth Nabel]] serves as the hospital's current President.<ref>{{cite web |title=Elizabeth Nabel, MD, President, Brigham Health |url=https://www.brighamandwomens.org/about-bwh/leadership/brigham-health-president-elizabeth-nabel |website=Brigham and Women's Hospital |publisher=Brigham Health |accessdate=22 January 2020}}</ref>

Brigham and Women's Hospital conducts the second largest hospital-based research program in the world, with an annual research budget of more than $630 million. Pioneering achievements at BWH have included the world's first successful heart valve operation and the world's first solid organ transplant.

Brigham and Women's Hospital was established with the 1980 merger of three Harvard-affiliated hospitals: [[Peter Bent Brigham]] Hospital (established in 1913), [[Peter Bent Brigham#Legacy and endowments|Robert Breck Brigham]] Hospital (established in 1914), and [[Boston Hospital for Women]] (established in 1966).

In the 2019 ''[[U.S. News & World Report]]'' hospital rankings, BWH was ranked second in Massachusetts and thirteenth nationally.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://health.usnews.com/best-hospitals/area/ma/brigham-and-womens-hospital-6140215 |title=Brigham and Women's Hospital |work=[[U.S. News & World Report]] |accessdate=2019-07-30 }}</ref>

==History==
[[Image:bwh-longwood.jpg|thumb|221 Longwood Avenue, formerly the Boston Lying-In Hospital building, part of Brigham and Women's Hospital but separate from the main building at 15-75 Francis Street; view from Longwood Avenue]]
[[Image:Free Hospital for Women.jpg|thumb|Former site of the Free Hospital for Women across the street from [[Olmsted Park]]. This institution was absorbed into Brigham and Women's Hospital.]]
Brigham and Women's Hospital was established with the 1980 merger of three Harvard-affiliated hospitals: [[Peter Bent Brigham]] Hospital, (established in 1913); [[Peter Bent Brigham#Legacy and endowments|Robert Breck Brigham]] Hospital (established in 1914); and [[Boston Hospital for Women]] (established in 1966 as a merger of [[Boston Lying-In Hospital]], established in 1832, and 
[[Free Hospital for Women]], established in 1875).

In 1954, the Peter Bent Brigham Hospital became the location for the first-ever successful kidney transplant, performed by [[Joseph Murray]] on [[Richard Herrick]].

After a 10-year affiliation with [[Faulkner Hospital]] in the [[Jamaica Plain]] section of Boston, BWH merged with the community hospital in 2012 to form Brigham and Women's Faulkner Hospital.<ref>{{cite web|title=Preliminary Review of PHS Proposed Acquisition|url=http://www.mass.gov/anf/docs/hpc/hpc-preliminary-review-of-phs-ssh-harbor-12-18-2013.pdf|author1=Massachusetts Health Policy Commission|date=18 December 2013|website=mass.gov|pages=1, 5|format=pdf|accessdate=8 November 2014}}</ref>

In April 2017, Brigham and Women's announced they would be offering [[Buyout|voluntary buyouts]] to 1,600 staff in an effort to control costs.  The hospital was profitable, but this move was due to higher labor and other costs amid stagnant payments from [[Health insurance in the United States|insurance companies]]. The hospital also needs to pay for two large projects, a $550 million new outpatient and research building that opened the previous year and a $335 million new software system that was launched in 2015.<ref>{{cite news|last=McCluskey|first=Priyanka Dayal|date=2017-04-27|title=Brigham and Women’s offers buyouts to 1,600 workers|work=[[The Boston Globe]]|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2017/04/27/brigham-hospital-offers-voluntary-buyouts-workers/ziDBNctyyioYrRL0GJ2t0J/story.html|accessdate=2017-04-27}}</ref>

Also in April 2017, the [[United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts]] announced that Brigham and Women's Hospital and its nonprofit hospital and physicians network, Partners HealthCare, agreed to pay a $10 million fine to resolve allegations that a [[stem cell]] research lab fraudulently obtained [[Federal grants in the United States|federal grant funding]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Finucane|first=Martin|date=2017-04-27|title=Partners, Brigham and Women's to pay $10m in research fraud case|work=[[The Boston Globe]]|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2017/04/27/million-settlement-announced-brigham-and-women-research-fraud-case/Tml7mJl1isJhUwSOZIyNlO/story.html|accessdate=2017-04-27}}</ref>

==Quality and safety==
In the early 1990s, BWH pioneered Computerized Physician Order Entry (CPOE) to prevent medication errors. BWH has received patient safety awards for its electronic Medication Administration Record (eMAR) and barcoding system, which places barcodes on patients' medications, name bands, and nurses' badges. A nurse scans all three barcodes before administering a medication to ensure that each patient receives the correct medication and dosage at the correct time.<ref name="brighamandwomens" /><ref>Thomas W. Cooley, et al. "Implementation of computerized prescriber order entry in four academic medical centers," ''American Journal of Health-System Pharmacy'' (12/15/2012) 69#24 pp 2166-2173</ref>

The orthopedic surgery department focused on patients' satisfaction for those who received knee and hip replacements. Leaders in the department included John Wright, Mary Anne Kenyon, and Carolyn Beagan, but they gave little attention to holding costs down.<ref>"Patients Come First at Brigham and Women's Department of Orthopedic Surgery," ''Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery, American Volume'' (March 2013) Special Report, Jeffrey Shyu, p17-23.</ref>

==Research==
In 2013, the BWH Biomedical Research Institute (BRI) received $630 million in research support from all sources. For over a decade, it has been one of the two hospitals receiving the most National Institutes of Health (NIH) funding among independent hospitals in the United States.  It employs over 3,300 researchers.

BRI has worked on regenerative medicine, designing nanoparticles to attack different types of cancer and starting a clinical trial for a type of Alzheimer's disease vaccine. BWH research also includes population studies including the Nurses' Health Study and Physicians' Health Study.<ref name="brighamandwomens" />

The 21st century has seen dramatic shifts in the diagnostic and therapeutic approach to lung carcinomas, beginning with the discovery of [[epidermal growth factor receptor]] (EGFR) mutations and their role in directing management with targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Since 2003, this has reshaped the approach at BWH's molecular diagnostic testing center.<ref>Neal Lindeman, "Molecular Diagnostics of Lung Cancers at the Brigham and Women's Hospital and Dana-Farber Cancer Institute: Technology in Rapid Evolution", ''Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine'' (Oct 2012) 136#10 pp. 1198–1200. {{pmid|23020723}}, {{doi|10.5858/arpa.2012-0277-RA}}.</ref>

In 2017, the hospital began the first human clinical trials to reverse the aging process using [[Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide|NAD{{+}}]]. The trials are headed by biologist [[David Andrew Sinclair]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/03/170323141340.htm|title=Scientists unveil a giant leap for anti-aging|author=|date=|website=[[ScienceDaily]] |accessdate=2 April 2018}}</ref>

In 2019, BWH opened the Brigham Preventive Genomics Clinic,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/healthcare-information-technology/brigham-and-women-s-launches-preventive-genomics-clinic.html|title=Brigham and Women's launches preventive genomics clinic|website=www.beckershospitalreview.com}}</ref> becoming one of the first hospitals in the United States<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wbur.org/commonhealth/2019/08/16/cadillac-dna-testing-genomics|title=Concierge DNA Testing: Boston Doctors And Genetic Counselors Consult, But It Will Cost You|website=www.wbur.org}}</ref> to offer DNA sequencing, reporting, and interpretation of disease-associated genes to healthy patients seeking to reduce their risk of future disease.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/top-u-s-medical-centers-roll-out-dna-sequencing-clinics-for-healthy-clients/|title=Top U.S. Medical Centers Roll Out DNA Sequencing Clinics for Healthy Clients|first=Rebecca|last=Robbins,STAT|website=Scientific American}}</ref>
