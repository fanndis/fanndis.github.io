After graduating from San Beda College, Del Castillo pursued law studies at the Ateneo de Manila University. He joined the judiciary in 1989 as a Municipal Trial Court judge of San Mateo, Rizal before he was promoted as a Regional Trial Court judge of Angeles City in 1992, and later as a Regional Trial Court judge of Quezon City in 1995, where he was appointed First Vice-Executive Judge. He was appointed as a CA justice in 2001.

== Plagiarism controversy ==
On 28 April 2010, Justice del Castillo penned the decision on ''Vinuya vs. Executive Secretary'', a case involving Filipina sex slavery victims during the Japanese occupation in the [[Second World War]].  Petitioners said that it contains "plagiarized portions" taken out of context to support the arguments for denying their petition.<ref>{{cite news|last=Dedace|first=Sophia|title=Comfort women decry 'plagiarized' SC ruling|url=http://www.gmanews.tv/story/196443/comfort-women-decry-plagiarized-sc-ruling|accessdate=10 August 2010|publisher=GMA News|date=July 19, 2010}}</ref>
