'''''The Apprentice''''' is an American [[reality television]] program that judges the business skills of a group of contestants. It has run in various formats across fifteen seasons since January 2004 on [[NBC]], with the most recent season having run in 2017.

''The Apprentice'' was created by British-born American television producer [[Mark Burnett]].<ref name="ny2019">{{cite news |last1=Keefe |first1=Patrick |title=How Mark Burnett Resurrected Donald Trump as an Icon of American Success |url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/01/07/how-mark-burnett-resurrected-donald-trump-as-an-icon-of-american-success |accessdate=30 December 2018 |publisher=The New Yorker |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181230091247/https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/01/07/how-mark-burnett-resurrected-donald-trump-as-an-icon-of-american-success |archive-date=December 30, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref> Billed as "The Ultimate Job Interview," the show features fourteen to eighteen business people who compete over the course of a season, with usually one contestant eliminated per episode. Contestants are split into two "corporations" (teams), with one member from each volunteering as a project manager on each new task. The corporations complete business-related tasks such as selling products, raising money for charity, or creating an advertising campaign, with one corporation selected as the winner based on objective measures and subjective opinions of the host and his advisors who monitor the teams' performance on tasks. The losing corporation attends a boardroom meeting with the show's host and their advisors to break down why they lost and determine who contributed the least to the team. Episodes ended with the host eliminating one contestant from the competition, with the words "You're fired!"

Seven of the show's seasons featured aspiring, but otherwise unknown, businesspersons who would vie for the show's prize, a one-year $250,000 starting contract to promote one of [[Donald Trump]]'s properties. There have also been eight seasons of ''[[The Celebrity Apprentice]]'' since 2008. In this format, several celebrities would participate to win money for their chosen charities, with the final prize being a large donation to the celebrity's charity and the title of "Apprentice". A [[reboot]] of this format, ''[[The New Celebrity Apprentice]]'', aired in January 2017. The U.S. series originated a [[List of television show franchises|franchise of international television shows]] collectively known as ''[[The Apprentice (franchise)|The Apprentice]]'', which has had over 20 local versions.

[[Donald Trump]] was the show's host for the first fourteen seasons, with the show affording him popularity that contributed to his rise to the presidency of the United States. After Trump declared his [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016|candidacy for the presidency]], NBC announced that actor and former [[Governor of California|California governor]] [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] would become the new host of ''[[The Celebrity Apprentice]]'',<ref>{{cite web |title=Arnold Schwarzenegger to replace Donald Trump as Celebrity Apprentice host |url=https://www.ew.com/article/2015/09/14/arnold-schwarzenegger-replace-donald-Trump-celebrity-apprentice-host |first=James |last=Hibberd |work=Entertainment Weekly |date=September 14, 2015 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170108203517/http://ew.com/article/2015/09/14/arnold-schwarzenegger-replace-donald-trump-celebrity-apprentice-host/ |archivedate=January 8, 2017 }}</ref><ref name="ew-2017prem">{{cite web |last1=Lawrence |first1=Derek |title=Arnold Schwarzenegger's Celebrity Apprentice gets premiere date |url=https://www.ew.com/article/2016/06/08/arnold-schwarzenegger-celebrity-apprentice-premiere-date |work=Entertainment Weekly |accessdate=June 8, 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609070719/http://www.ew.com/article/2016/06/08/arnold-schwarzenegger-celebrity-apprentice-premiere-date |archivedate=June 9, 2016 }}</ref> starting January 2017. Lifestyle mogul [[Martha Stewart]] hosted the one-season spin-off ''[[The Apprentice: Martha Stewart]]'' in 2005.

== Format ==
''The Apprentice'' is a reality competition show featuring season-long competitions. Each season begins with a new group of contestants vying to earn a place in one of the organizations run by the host. The contestants (who are referred to as "candidates") have come from business backgrounds in various enterprises, the backgrounds including real estate, accounting, restaurant management, management consulting, sales and marketing.

During the show, the contestants live in a communal dwelling, a "penthouse suite", in New York City (save for Season 6 which took place in Los Angeles). The candidates are divided into two teams, treated as "corporations" within the show. These corporations select a name they are subsequently referred to through the rest of the show. Each week, the teams are assigned a task and required to select one of their members to lead the team as "project manager", who is to take responsibility for organizing the team and making executive decisions. Tasks are generally business oriented and tend to highlight one of several business skills. Tasks most commonly revolve around sales (selling the most items or earning the most money) and marketing (producing a specific marketing material or campaign that is judged by a company's executives). During the tasks, the teams are usually visited by one of the host's "advisors" for that week. Tasks typically lasted for one or two days. After the completion of the task, the teams meet with the host and his two advisers in "the [[boardroom]]".

Boardroom meetings generally proceed in three stages. In the preliminary stage, all of the remaining candidates on both teams gather in the boardroom to be briefed on the task by the host and his advisors. Team members are asked about how the task went and whether there were any strong or weak players. Teams are sometimes asked to comment on materials or products produced by the opposing team. At the end of this stage, the host or his advisors reveal the results of the task and announce which team was the winner. The winning team wins a reward (usually a unique, luxurious experience) and are excused from the boardroom while the losing team returns to the boardroom for an elimination. In later seasons, winning teams have been permitted to view the next stage of the boardroom on the TV in their suite.

The entire losing team remains in the boardroom and are confronted with their loss. They are interrogated as to the reasons for their loss and which players contributed to it or failed at the task. Then, for the final stage of the boardroom meeting, the project manager is asked to select a certain number of teammates (typically two, but on occasion one or three) to bring back into the final-stage boardroom meeting. The remaining teammates return to the suite while the project manager and the selected teammates step out of the boardroom momentarily so the host can consult with his advisors.

Upon returning to the boardroom for the final stage, the host and his advisors continue interrogating the remaining players about their loss. The project manager is sometimes further interrogated about his or her choice of teammates to bring back into the boardroom. Ultimately, at least one project manager and/or remaining teammate is "fired" at the host's discretion, and leaves the show. The host has broad discretion to fire candidates outside of this usual process, including firing multiple candidates at a time. The eliminated contestants are shown leaving the boardroom with their luggage and entering a taxi cab, during which they are given time to recount on their elimination that is shown over the episode's credits.

When only three or four candidates (depending on the season) are left, they are interviewed rather than being assigned a task. Executives from various companies interview the finalists and report their assessments to the host. Based on the interviews, a "boardroom meeting" and firing take place, leaving two candidates.

The final two candidates are then each assigned a different final task. Each is given a support team of previously fired candidates. Final tasks generally require the finalists to organize (to various degrees) an event such as a party or a fundraiser which has multiple planning elements. In a final boardroom meeting following the final task, the host "hires" one of the two candidates to become his "apprentice", winning the show's prize of a one-year $250,000 starting contract to manage a business project offered by the host.

== History and production ==
After experiencing [[Business career of Donald Trump|a series of financial setbacks in the early 1990s]], New York real-estate developer [[Donald Trump]] changed his business strategy from borrowing to build and purchase assets, to licensing his name to others.<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|last=Poniewozik|first=James|date=2020-09-28|title=Donald Trump Was the Real Winner of 'The Apprentice'|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/28/arts/television/trump-taxes-apprentice.html|access-date=2020-10-02|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> Producer [[Mark Burnett]] approached Trump about a new television show. Although Trump was skeptical, stating that [[reality television]] "was for the bottom-feeders of society", Burnett proposed that Trump appear as himself, a successful businessman with a luxurious lifestyle.<ref name="kranish20170119">{{Cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/a-fierce-will-to-win-pushed-donald-trump-to-the-top/2017/01/17/6b36c2ce-c628-11e6-8bee-54e800ef2a63_story.html |title=A fierce will to win pushed Donald Trump to the top |last=Kranish |first=Michael |date=January 19, 2017 |newspaper=The Washington Post |author-link=Michael Kranish |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170620193109/https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/a-fierce-will-to-win-pushed-donald-trump-to-the-top/2017/01/17/6b36c2ce-c628-11e6-8bee-54e800ef2a63_story.html |archivedate=June 20, 2017 }}</ref>

The show was co-produced by Burnett and Trump, its first season having aired in early 2004. The premise of the show, which bills itself as the "ultimate job interview" in the "ultimate jungle", is to conduct a job talent search for a person to head one of Trump's companies. The position starts with an introductory one-year contract with a starting yearly salary of $250,000.

The popularity of the show led to Trump becoming known for his fateful [[catch phrase]], "You're fired!" and for the emergence of [[wikt:Trumponomics|Trumponomics]], a "portmanteau of Donald Trump and economics initially spelled ‘Trump-Onomics’ (2004), [which] started out as a bland managerial concept on cable TV, meant to convey the notion that 'impressing the boss' was the only way to 'climb the corporate ladder' (The Apprentice, Season 1)."<ref>M. Nicolas J. Firzli : [http://www.analysefinanciere.org/2017/01/26/understanding-trumponomics 'Understanding Trumponomics', Revue Analyse Financière, 26 January 2017 – Supplement to Issue N°62] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170211160222/http://analysefinanciere.org/2017/01/26/understanding-trumponomics/ |date=February 11, 2017 }}</ref>

The opening theme music used on the show is "[[For the Love of Money]]", a 1973 [[R&B]] song by [[The O'Jays]].<ref>{{cite web |title=The Apprentice: Season One DVD Review |url=http://www.blimptv.net/the-apprentice-season-one-dvd-review/ |publisher=BlimpTV |accessdate=January 2, 2017 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170103100420/http://www.blimptv.net/the-apprentice-season-one-dvd-review/ |archivedate=January 3, 2017 }}</ref>

For most seasons, the candidates ostensibly live in a communal suite at [[Trump Tower (New York)|Trump Tower]] in [[Manhattan]]. This was originally billed as a penthouse suite, and after boardrooms, candidates were told to "go up" to the suite. However, in reality, the suite and the boardroom (and its elevator lobby) are all purpose-built sets within Trump Tower,<ref name=":0" /> all on the same floor. Later seasons of ''[[The Celebrity Apprentice]]'' no longer conceal this.

''The Apprentice'' was so successful that, according to Trump, he earned $214&nbsp;million from 14 seasons of the show, plus more from related product licensing as his name as a brand became more valuable.{{r|kranish20170119}} As the popularity of the series grew, more and more of the tasks began to be tied to specific companies. For example, sales tasks would require a team to take over a brand-name storefront or restaurant and operate it; and marketing tasks would require teams to prepare marketing material (e.g. a jingle or flyer) or campaign for an established company. In later series, the launches of specific products would be tied to the airing of episodes of the series. Several companies have appeared multiple times on the show.

Trump's original advisors were [[Carolyn Kepcher]], former chief operating officer and general manager for Trump National Golf Club, and [[George H. Ross]], Executive Vice President and Senior Counsel, the Trump Organization. In August 2006, Trump released Kepcher from her duties at the Trump organization saying only that he "wishes her the best." Kepcher also left ''The Apprentice'' at that time. Upon her departure, Trump's daughter, [[Ivanka Trump]] became a regular advisor, though she was not officially billed as a replacement for Kepcher.<ref>[http://people.aol.com/people/article/0,26334,1513009,00.html People Connection]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061202072350/http://people.aol.com/people/article/0%2C26334%2C1513009%2C00.html |date=December 2, 2006 }} AOL</ref> As the series progressed, the advisors were occasionally substituted on a weekly basis with other advisors including two of Trump's other children, [[Donald Trump Jr.]] and [[Eric Trump]], as well as past winners of the show and other business executives (typically from the company whose product or service was featured in the episode).

During Trump's tenure, the series frequently featured and promoted his properties, products and brand. Trump's wife [[Melania Trump]] was also featured on the series several times including in several tasks that have featured her fashion and cosmetic products. Ivanka Trump's fashion products have also been featured in tasks.

Trump's on-screen (and real-life) assistants have each grown in personal fame. Two assistants appeared jointly for the first five seasons: Rhona Graff and Robin Himmler. In season six, Trump elected to have his newest executive assistant, Andi Rowntree, star in the LA-based show. For the Celebrity Apprentice, Annette Dziamba appeared for the seventh season, and Amanda Miller since the eighth season.

Season six, unlike the rest of the series, took place in Los Angeles. The teams resided in a mansion, with the winning team of each challenge occupying the house, and the losing team camping out in tents in the backyard.

On May 14, 2007, the series was left off NBC's schedule, but NBC Entertainment president [[Kevin Reilly (executive)|Kevin Reilly]] said he was still in discussions with [[Mark Burnett]] and Trump.<ref>[http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/CA6441978.html Guthrie, Marisa; "UPFRONT: NBC Unveils Fall Picks"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071226184701/http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/CA6441978.html |date=December 26, 2007 }} broadcastingcable.com; May 14, 2007</ref> On May 19, 2007, Trump announced that he was "moving on from ''The Apprentice'' to a major new TV venture".<ref>[http://www.realitytvworld.com/news/the-apprentice-star-donald-Trump-nbc-you-cant-fire-me-i-quit-5200.php 'The Apprentice' star Donald Trump to NBC: You can't fire me, I quit] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306072141/http://www.realitytvworld.com/news/the-apprentice-star-donald-Trump-nbc-you-cant-fire-me-i-quit-5200.php |date=March 6, 2016 }} Reality TV World</ref> On May 22, NBC announced ''The Apprentice'' might return next season even though Trump had said he had quit.<ref>[http://www.realityblurred.com/realitytv/archives/the_celebrity_apprentice/2007_May_22_nbc_statement Denhart, Andy; "NBC says The Apprentice could return despite Trump's quitting"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310064810/http://www.realityblurred.com/realitytv/archives/the_celebrity_apprentice/2007_May_22_nbc_statement |date=March 10, 2012 }} realityblurred.com; May 22, 2007</ref> However, NBC and Trump resolved their differences, and the first season of ''The Celebrity Apprentice'' began production shortly thereafter.

Following Trump's election as president in 2016, Burnett has kept in touch with Trump about additional television shows, and at one point, Burnett proposed the idea of ''The Apprentice: White House'', which would have been filmed following Trump's departure from office and would have been focused on political activities. However, no firm plans have been established for this.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.thedailybeast.com/trump-and-apprentice-creator-mark-burnett-are-discussing-their-next-tv-show | title = Trump and 'Apprentice' Creator Mark Burnett Are Discussing Their Next TV Show | first = Lachlan | last = Cartright | date = November 7, 2019 | accessdate = November 7, 2019 | work = [[The Daily Beast]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20191107111747/https://www.thedailybeast.com/trump-and-apprentice-creator-mark-burnett-are-discussing-their-next-tv-show | archive-date = November 7, 2019 | url-status = live }}</ref>

=== Martha Stewart ===
{{See also|The Apprentice: Martha Stewart}}
On February 2, 2005, NBC announced that they would broadcast the first spin-off from ''The Apprentice'', called ''The Apprentice: Martha Stewart''. The show, which ran from September 21 to December 21, 2005 was hosted by [[Martha Stewart]], who was the first woman in the world to become a self-made billionaire. It kept the format of the original series but changed a few elements to fit Stewart's personality. Trump was one of the executive producers of the show and castings were held in 27 cities across the United States.

At the time, the original ''Apprentice'' was airing new seasons in each of the fall and winter, each with declining overall ratings. ''The Apprentice: Martha Stewart'' aired on Wednesdays during the same fall season as the fourth season of the original ''Apprentice'' (which aired Thursdays). ''The Apprentice: Martha Stewart'' struggled while the original series' fourth season again earned poorer ratings than the previous season. Trump claimed that there was "confusion" between the two shows.  There has also been talk that Trump did not want Stewart to host the spin-off show.  NBC announced that it would not bring back the show for a second season, although the network stressed that the show was initially planned to air only for one season.  The show averaged between six and seven million viewers. Before Stewart's show ended, Trump and Stewart had a fight over Stewart accusing Trump that he did not want her to have a successful show, that he might have wanted it jinxed. Trump denied this charge, and both TV stars have not worked together again, and there are no plans for the future.

== Video games ==
At the [[Electronic Entertainment Expo]] on May 17, 2005, [[Legacy Interactive]] announced that it had purchased the rights to develop a video game based on ''The Apprentice''.

The player chooses a character and is then paired up with one of four former ''Apprentice'' contestants, including Omarosa. The player must perform well in a series of business tasks, played across 18 [[minigame]]s, to avoid a boardroom confrontation with Donald Trump and his advisors, George Ross and Carolyn Kepcher.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=47726 |title=The Apprentice – Overview |last=Marriott |first=Scott Alan |work=[[AllGame]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141114171409/http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=47726 |archive-date=November 14, 2014 |accessdate=September 11, 2016}}</ref><ref name=GameSpot />

Alex Navarro of [[GameSpot]] rated the game 3 out of 10 and called it a "collection of games that you can play better versions of for free or significantly cheaper elsewhere on the Internet. Not only are these games overly simplistic, they're just not that much fun." Navarro wrote, "Most offensive of all, however, is how cheaply The Apprentice handles its license. This game presents itself horribly. It looks like it was programmed hastily with Macromedia, with all the characters appearing as weirdly drawn cartoon versions of themselves." Navarro also criticized the game's audio clips of Donald Trump, and its short length, noting that the entire game could be completed in 20 minutes.<ref name=GameSpot>{{cite web |url=http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-apprentice-review/1900-6145982/ |title=The Apprentice Review |last=Navarro |first=Alex |date=March 15, 2006 |work=[[GameSpot]] |accessdate=September 11, 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180412145747/https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-apprentice-review/1900-6145982/ |archivedate=April 12, 2018 }}</ref>

The player must serve customers throughout the game's 40 levels, set in four locations. Depending on the player's success throughout the game, the player receives praise and criticism from Donald Trump, Donald Trump Jr., and Ivanka Trump.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=52969 |title=The Apprentice: Los Angeles – Overview |last=Marriott |first=Scott Alan |work=AllGame |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141114171404/http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=52969 |archive-date=November 14, 2014 |accessdate=September 11, 2016}}</ref>

Jim Squries of [[Gamezebo]] gave the game three and a half stars out of five, and praised the "bright" and "colorful" graphics, as well as the "smooth" controls and diverse gameplay. Squries wrote, "Ultimately, the only disappointment to be found in The Apprentice is the slightly shoddy handling of parts of the license. Trump's audio clips are brief and sound like they were recorded in a tin shack, while the team-based aspects of the show could've been played up more to create additional appeal for fans of the show."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gamezebo.com/2007/05/01/apprentice-los-angeles-review/ |title=The Apprentice: Los Angeles Review |last=Squries |first=Jim |date=May 1, 2007 |work=[[Gamezebo]] |accessdate=September 11, 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180412145921/https://www.gamezebo.com/2007/05/01/apprentice-los-angeles-review/ |archivedate=April 12, 2018 }}</ref>
