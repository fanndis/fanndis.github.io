He has been a leading conservative voice in making the case for increasing the [[child tax credit]] to properly compensate parents for the cost of raising children, and won praise for finding common ground with progressives and Democrats on the issue.<ref name="Ramesh Ponnuru, Visiting Fellow"/><ref>{{Cite news|url = http://www.nationalreview.com/article/301108/empty-playground-and-welfare-state-ramesh-ponnuru|title = The Empty Playground and the Welfare State|date = May 28, 2012|work = National Review|access-date = 10 August 2016}}</ref> He has also been a regular co-author and leading voice with economist David Beckworth on the topic of [[monetary policy]] and [[market monetarism]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Beckworth|first1=David|last2=Ponnuru|first2=Ramesh|title=Monetary Regime Change|url=https://www.nationalreview.com/nrd/articles/300951/monetary-regime-change|accessdate=10 August 2016|work=National Review|issue=28 May 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Ponnuru|first1=Ramesh|last2=Beckworth|first2=David|title=Savers' Real Problem|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/article/397460/savers-real-problem-ramesh-ponnuru-david-beckworth|accessdate=10 August 2016|work=National Review|issue=2 February 2015}}</ref>

Ponnuru appears frequently on a diverse array of television programs about public affairs, among them ''[[Meet the Press]]'',<ref>{{cite web|title=Meet the Press, 21 September 2014|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/watch/meet-the-press/ponnuru-on-mtp-distancing-from-president-never-works-331747907650|publisher=NBC|accessdate=10 August 2016}}</ref> ''[[Face the Nation]]'', ''[[C-Span]]'', the ''[[PBS NewsHour]]'', National Public Radio's ''[[All Things Considered]]'', ABC News' ''[[This Week with George Stephanopoulos]]'', ''[[ABC News]]''.

He has also been a regular guest speaker on policy, politics, and [[constitutionalism]] at college campuses and law schools across the country,<ref>{{cite web|title=The Future of the Republican Party|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aahxoo6o95Q|website=YouTube|publisher=Program on Constitutional Government, Harvard|accessdate=10 August 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Beyond Obamanomics|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f_qX84MAOs|website=YouTube|publisher=Ashbrook Center|accessdate=10 August 2016}}</ref> In 2013, he was a fellow at the [[University of Chicago]]’s [[University of Chicago Institute of Politics|Institute of Politics]]. The Institute's website has described "the Fellows" as "a dynamic and distinguished group of political practitioners and journalists who will lead seminars and interact with UChicago students and faculty."<ref>{{cite web|title=Getting to Know UChicago Institute of Politics Fall 2013 Fellow Ramesh Ponnuru|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHSQnEq6Oms|website=YouTube|publisher=University of Chicago Institute of Politics|accessdate=10 August 2016}}</ref>

In 2006, Ponnuru wrote ''[[The Party of Death: The Democrats, the Media, the Courts, and the Disregard for Human Life]]''.
Provactively titled on purpose, the volume is Ponnuru's exposition on such right to life issues as abortion and euthanasia, concentrating on the circumstances of the United States Democratic Party's shift from anti-abortion to abortion rights.  The book was met with near universal favorable reviews. [[Peggy Noonan]] celebrated the book as "the most significant statement of the need to protect human life in America since Ronald Reagan’s ''Abortion and the Conscience of a Nation''.

''[[National Review Online]]'' [[Editor at Large]] [[Jonah Goldberg]], wrote: "Ponnuru scrupulously sticks to nonreligious arguments, accessible to everyone. But that hasn’t stopped critics from charging that his motives are unacceptably 'religious,' while others have complained Ponnuru is too coldly rational. Again it seems Ponnuru’s real sin isn’t how he says things, but that he says them at all."<ref>[https://archive.is/20120712135830/http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=ZjAyNzRlNDU3NmQ3ZjQwYWI1MTAyOTg2OTVjY2Y3NmU Abortion Rhymes with Death] Goldberg, J. 2006-06-16</ref>

[[John Derbyshire]] wrote in ''[[The New English Review]]'': "[[Right to life|RTL]] is made as presentable as possible in ''Party of Death'', with writing that is engaging and lucid.... (Right to Lifers) are welcoming ''Party of Death'' very joyfully, though, and they are right to do so, as it is an exceptionally fine piece of polemical writing in support of their... cause.... ''Party of Death'' is obviously inspired by religious belief. The philosophical passages strictly follow the [[Golden Rule]] of religious apologetics, which is: The conclusion is known in advance, and the task of the intellectual is to erect supporting arguments."<ref>[http://www.newenglishreview.org/custpage.cfm?frm=3190&sec_id=3190 A Frigid and Pitiless Dogma] Derbyshire, J. June, 2006.</ref>

In a sharp, but measured response to accusations that Ponnuru had an overtly religious viewpoint in approaching the abortion issue, he forcefully addressed the issue himself head on: "I have made a show of reasoning, but my conclusions have all rather conveniently lined up with the teachings of my church.... For the record, my views on abortion have not changed since I was an agnostic.... It is true that I am a Catholic. It is also true that I believe that my church’s teaching on abortion is reasonable, sound, and correct. It is because I came to believe that Catholicism is true, after all, that I became a Catholic. If I didn’t believe Catholic teachings were true, I wouldn’t be a Catholic."<ref>{{cite web |last1=Ponnuru |first1=Ramesh |title=Unreason: John Derbyshire vs. pro-lifers |url=https://www.nationalreview.com/2006/06/unreason-ramesh-ponnuru/ |website=National Review Online |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070807011543/http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=MjFmMjRiNGI4Y2RhZjY5YjNlOGY0MjU4YzI0OTZkNmU |archivedate=2007-08-07 |url-status=live |date=2006-06-07}}</ref>

Ponnuru has also been the author of a highly influential monograph on Japanese industrial policy, published jointly by the [[American Enterprise Institute]] and [[Center for Policy Studies]].<ref>{{cite book|title=The Mystery of Japanese Growth|date=1995|publisher=American Enterprise Institute / Center for Policy Studies|isbn=0844739391|url=https://www.cps.org.uk/files/reports/original/111027153606-TheMysteryofJapeneseGrowth1995.pdf}}</ref>

===Policy===
Ponnuru is a frequent speaker on conservative policy and its political implications, and has regularly been a featured guest at retreats for congressional Republicans.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Sherman|first1=Jake|last2=Everett|first2=Burgess|title=GOP retreat: A busy schedule|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2015/01/gop-retreat-114272|accessdate=10 August 2016|work=Politico|issue=14 January 2015}}</ref>

He has been identified as a leader of the "reform conservative" movement,<ref>{{cite news|last1=Douthat|first1=Ross|title=What Is Reform Conservatism?|url=http://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/05/30/what-is-reform-conservatism/?_r=0|accessdate=10 August 2016|work=New York Times|issue=30 May 2015}}</ref> and was prominently featured in a 2014 ''[[New York Times Magazine]]'' cover story about the conservative intellectuals who comprise it. The ''Times''' [[Sam Tanenhaus]] described Ponnuro as one of a small group of young conservative Republicans, who, each one, "was an intellectual prodigy in his 30s" who together had "become the leaders of a small band of reform conservatives, sometimes called reformicons, who believe the health of the G.O.P. hinges on jettisoning its age-old doctrine — orgiastic tax-cutting, the slashing of government programs, the championing of Wall Street — and using an altogether different vocabulary, backed by specific proposals, that will reconnect the party to middle-class and low-income voters."<ref>{{cite news|last1=Tanenhaus|first1=Sam|title=Can the G.O.P. Be a Party of Ideas?|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/06/magazine/can-the-gop-be-a-party-of-ideas.html|accessdate=10 August 2016|work=The New York Times|issue=2 July 2014}}</ref>

In 2014, Ponnuru co-edited, with [[Yuval Levin]], ''Room to Grow: Conservative Reforms for a Limited Government and a Thriving Middle Class,''<ref>{{cite book|title=Room to Grow|date=2014|publisher=Conservative Reform Network|url=http://conservativereform.com/roomtogrow/|accessdate=10 August 2016}}</ref> a reform conservative manifesto and policy agenda. (Ponnuru also contributed the book's concluding chapter, on [[constitutionalism]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Room to Grow|date=2014|publisher=Conservative Reform Network|url=http://conservativereform.com/recovering-wisdom-constitution/|chapter=Recovering the Wisdom of the Constitution | accessdate=10 August 2016}}</ref>) The book was widely praised, with ''New York Times'' columnist [[David Brooks (journalist)|David Brooks]] describing it as a "policy-laden manifesto... which is the most coherent and compelling policy agenda the American right has produced this century."<ref>{{cite news|last1=Brooks|first1=David|title=The New Right|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/10/opinion/brooks-the-new-right.html|accessdate=10 August 2016|work=The New York Times|issue=9 June 2014}}</ref>

Ponnuru's collaboration with Levin also won widespread praise because of Levin's own high standing in the conservative movement: Levin has been called "probably the most influential conservative intellectual of the Obama era" by [[Jonathan Chait]] of ''[[New York Magazine]]'',<ref>{{cite web|last=Chait|first=Jonathan|title=The Facts Are In and Paul Ryan Is Wrong|url=http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2013/05/facts-are-in-and-paul-ryan-is-wrong.html|work=New York|accessdate=10 May 2013}}</ref> while the left leaning ''[[The New Republic]]'' has described Levin as "the conservative movement’s great intellectual hope" and has said that "despite his youth, Levin had been anointed the next great neoconservative." <ref name="babykristol">{{cite news |url=https://newrepublic.com/article/112745/yuval-levin-rights-new-irving-kristol |title=Baby Kristol |last=Tracy |first=Mark |work=[[The New Republic]] |date=March 25, 2013 |accessdate=February 9, 2017}}</ref>
