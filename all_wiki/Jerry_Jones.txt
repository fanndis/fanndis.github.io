'''Jerral Wayne "Jerry" Jones''' (born October 13, 1942)<ref>{{cite news |title=Jerry Jones's Career Capsule |url=https://www.profootballhof.com/players/jerry-jones/capsule/ |website=ProFootballHOF.com |accessdate=November 21, 2019}}</ref> is an American [[billionaire]] businessman and has been the owner of the [[National Football League]] (NFL)'s [[Dallas Cowboys]] since 1989.

==Early life==
Jones was born in [[Los Angeles|Los Angeles, California]]. His family moved back to [[North Little Rock, Arkansas]] in 1945.<ref>Dent, Jim.  ''King of the Cowboys: The Life and Times of Jerry Jones'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=yPo1JGwOkVgC&q=%22jerry+jones%22+1945+angeles&dq=%22jerry+jones%22+1945+angeles p. 214] (Adams Media Corporation, 1995): "Pat Jones moved his family back from Los Angeles to North Little Rock in 1945."</ref> Jones' father J.W.

After his graduation, Jones' parents moved to [[Springfield, Missouri]], where Pat was president and chairman of Modern Security Life Insurance Co.  The company, which an advertisement billed as a "one in a million" company, saw its assets increase from $440,299.76 in its first statement in 1961 to $6,230,607 in 1965. After graduating from the [[University of Arkansas]], Jerral W. Jones was listed as an executive vice president.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/17250991/springfield_leader_19660220_p20 |title=Springfield Leader 1966-02-20 p20 |publisher=Newspapers.com |date=February 20, 1966 |accessdate=February 11, 2018}}</ref> With the success of the company, the Joneses assembled the 5,500-acre Buena Vista Ranch east of Springfield in [[Rogersville, Missouri]] in the [[Ozark Mountains]].  In 1971, after selling the insurance company, the couple carved out 400 acres of their ranch to start Buena Vista Animal Paradise, where tourists could visit exotic animals (now Wild Animal Safari in [[Strafford, Missouri]], just south of [[Interstate 44]]).<ref name="legacy1"/>

===College football career===
Jones attended the [[University of Arkansas]], where he was a member of the [[Kappa Sigma]] fraternity.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://kappasigma.org/prominent-alumni/ |title=Prominent Alumni - Kappa Sigma Fraternity |author= |date= |website=kappasigma.org |accessdate=September 25, 2018}}</ref> He was co-captain of the [[1964 Arkansas Razorbacks football team|1964 National Championship]] football team. He was an all-[[Southwest Conference]] [[offensive lineman]] for [[College Football Hall of Fame]] coach [[Frank Broyles]] and a teammate of college football and NFL coach [[Jimmy Johnson (American football coach)|Jimmy Johnson]], whom Jones hired as his first head coach after purchasing the Cowboys.<ref name=":0" />

Other notable teammates were [[Glen Ray Hines]], a consensus [[All-American]] [[offensive tackle]]; [[Ken Hatfield]], who went on to coach several major programs including Arkansas; [[Jim Lindsey]]; future [[Outland Trophy]] winner [[Loyd Phillips]]; and College Football Hall of Fame [[linebacker]] [[Ronnie Caveness]].<ref name=":1">{{Cite web |url=https://www.arkansasnews.com/article/20141011/SPORTS/310119939 |title=Arkansas Celebrates 1964 National Title Team |last= |first= |date=October 11, 2014 |website=Arkansas News Bureau |language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status=|access-date=June 21, 2019}}</ref> Several future head coaches were assistant coaches for Broyles on the Razorbacks' staff during Jones's college career in [[Fayetteville, Arkansas|Fayetteville]], including three more members of the College Football Hall of Fame: [[Hayden Fry]] ([[Southern Methodist University]], [[North Texas State University]] and [[University of Iowa]]); [[Johnny Majors]] ([[Iowa State University]], [[University of Pittsburgh]] and [[University of Tennessee]]), and [[Barry Switzer]] ([[University of Oklahoma]], and later head coach of the Cowboys under Jones).<ref name=":1" />

Jones is one of a very small number of NFL owners who had a significant level of success as a football player.<ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/wire?section=ncf&id=3171782 Former Razorback Jerry Jones meets with Arkansas players – College Football – ESPN].

==Business ventures==
According to an interview with Jones on [[HBO]], after graduating from college in 1965, he borrowed a million dollars from Jimmy Hoffa's Teamsters union to open up a string of Shakey's Pizza Parlor restaurants in Missouri. When that venture failed, Jones was given a job at his father's insurance company Modern Security Life of Springfield, Missouri. He received his master's degree in business in 1970. After several other unsuccessful business ventures (including an attempt, again using Teamsters money, to purchase the [[American Football League]]'s [[San Diego Chargers]] in 1967), he began an oil and gas exploration business in [[Arkansas]], Jones Oil and Land Lease, which became successful.<ref>[http://www.askmen.com/celebs/men/business_politics_60/72_jerry_jones.html Jerry Jones Sports Biography, Photos & Rise To Success]. AskMen (October 13, 1942). Retrieved on 2010-12-21.</ref> His privately held company currently does natural resource prospecting.

===Criticism===
[[File:GULFSTREAM G-V N1DC Dallas Cowboys owners personal plane at VNY by D Ramey Logan.jpg|thumb|GULFSTREAM G-V N1DC Dallas Cowboys owners personal plane at VNY]]
In an online poll from October 8, 2003, Jones was named the least favorite sports personality by ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'', in three states (Virginia, Delaware and Texas).<ref>[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/magazine/features/si50/news/2003/10/09/press/ Sports Illustrated features state of Virginia in series of 50 state-specific weekly sections], Sportsillustrated.cnn.com, October 9, 2003; retrieved December 21, 2010.</ref>

Jones is often vilified by fans who remain bitter at his unceremonious firings of long-time Cowboys personnel who were fan favorites, head coach [[Tom Landry]] and general manager [[Tex Schramm]], even though the Cowboys had been doing poorly in the last few seasons before Jones became the team owner. Jones stated he did not give consideration to retaining Landry for even a season, as he said he would not have purchased the team unless he could hire Johnson as coach. Jones also did not discuss the matter beforehand with Landry before announcing the decision. This was denounced by football fans and media as totally lacking in class and respect, as pride and tradition were part of the Cowboys where great performance and loyal service were expected to be rewarded. Since the dismissal, Jones has indicated he regrets the process of Landry's firing and his role in it. It would later emerge that Jones' predecessor Bright had been dissatisfied with Landry for years and had even offered to relieve Jones of the inevitable criticism by dismissing the longtime coach himself prior to selling the team.<ref name="auto"/>

Some of the fan criticism is due to Jones' high visibility and involvement as the "face of the team",<ref>{{cite web |title=Jerry Jones built a Hall of Fame legacy for knowing how to 'stir it up a little bit' |url=https://www.sbnation.com/2017/8/4/16095452/jerry-jones-hall-of-fame-induction-dallas-cowboys |website=SB Nation |publisher=Vox Media |accessdate=July 22, 2018 |date=August 4, 2017}}</ref> a marked contrast to both Bright and the Cowboys' original owner, [[Clint Murchison Jr.]] Jones' prominent role has led to fans expressing their displeasure with Jones and the lack of success of the franchise, with particular criticism focusing on Jones' insistence on serving as his own general manager.<ref>{{cite web |title=Why Jerry Jones' argument for keeping GM role no longer holds water |url=https://sportsday.dallasnews.com/dallas-cowboys/cowboys/2018/03/17/jerry-jones-argument-keeping-gm-role-no-longer-holds-water |website=Dallas Morning News |publisher=Dallas Morning News |accessdate=June 27, 2018 |date=March 17, 2018}}</ref> There was particular criticism of Jones over his conflict with head coach [[Jimmy Johnson (American football coach)|Jimmy Johnson]], as Jones who was general manager "wanted Cowboys fans to know he had helped build those Super Bowl-winning teams", while "Johnson insisted that he made all of the personnel moves" since he had the final say in football matters and refused to relinquish this power; consequently Jones ousted Johnson after the 1993 season despite winning two consecutive Super Bowls and has refused to induct Johnson into the Cowboys Ring of Honor. Jones also initially promised head coach [[Bill Parcells]] complete control over football matters, however their relationship broke down after Jones signed controversial wide receiver [[Terrell Owens]]. Parcell's successor as Cowboys head coach, [[Wade Phillips]], had complained to friends about being "undermined and second-guessed, repeatedly" by Jones.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/espn/feature/story/_/id/11420510/dallas-cowboys-owner-jerry-jones-wants-known-football-man|title=Jerry Jones can't buy what he really wants|website=ESPN.com}}</ref>

Jones is one of two owners in the league (the other being [[Cincinnati Bengals|Cincinnati]]'s [[Mike Brown (American football executive)|Mike Brown]]) who have either the title or powers of general manager.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Lane |first1=Mark |title=Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones explains why he is also the team president and GM |url=https://www.all22.com/dallas-cowboys/dallas-cowboys-owner-jerry-jones-also-president-general-manager-explains-hall-of-fame |website=all22.com |publisher=Cox Media Group |accessdate=July 22, 2018}}</ref> Over the years of Jones's tenure, Cowboys fans have organized a number of grassroots efforts aimed at displacing Jones from his position.<ref>[http://firejerryjones.com/ Fire Jerry Jones!], firejerryjones.com; retrieved December 21, 2010.</ref>

Jones is the subject of the 2008 book ''Playing to Win'' by David Magee. In the book, Jones admitted he handled the firing of Landry poorly and accepted some blame for the disintegration of his relationship with Landry's successor, [[Jimmy Johnson (American football coach)|Jimmy Johnson]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

Jones became involved in the [[St. Louis Rams]] move back to [[Los Angeles]] with [[Stan Kroenke]] in 2016. He was instrumental in brokering a deal between Stan Kroenke, [[San Diego Chargers]] owner [[Dean Spanos]], and [[Oakland Raiders]] owner [[Mark Davis (American football)|Mark Davis]] to ensure that Kroenke's [[SoFi Stadium]] plan passed which it did via a 30-2 owners vote in favor.

===NFL fines===
Jones was fined $25,000 by the NFL for publicly criticizing referee [[Ed Hochuli]] after Hochuli made a call in a game between the [[San Diego Chargers]] and the [[Denver Broncos]] on September 14, 2008. Jones made comments both to the press and on his radio show, saying Hochuli was one of the most criticized officials in the NFL. This was Jones' first fine by the NFL.<ref>''San Diego Union Tribune'', September 29, 2008, D14</ref>

In 2009, Jones was fined $100,000 for violating a gag order on labor issues, commenting that revenue sharing was "on its way out".<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/thehuddle/post/2009/09/espn-nfl-fines-cowboys-jerry-jones-100000-for-cba-remarks/1 |title=NFL fines Cowboys' Jerry Jones $100,000 for CBA remarks |author=Sean Leahy |publisher=[[USA Today]] |date=September 13, 2009}}</ref> Commissioner [[Roger Goodell]] had issued a gag order for all owners and team executives from discussing any aspect of the pending labor issues.

Goodell did not disclose the specific amount of Jones' fine in the memo.<ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=4469721 Sources: Jerry Jones fined for labor remarks – ESPN].

==Jones in popular culture==
Jones was the inspiration for the character Baxter Cain ([[Robert Vaughn]]), owner of the Dallas Felons, in the 1998 film ''[[BASEketball]]''. He had a brief cameo appearance as himself in the 1998 made-for-television reunion movie ''[[Dallas: War of the Ewings]]''.

Jones also appeared as himself in a 1996 episode of the TV show ''[[Coach (TV series)|Coach]]'' and in a 2007 television commercial for [[Diet Pepsi MAX]], which also featured then Cowboys head coach [[Wade Phillips]] and quarterback [[Tony Romo]].

He appeared as himself in the seventh season of the [[HBO]] series ''[[Entourage (U.S. TV series)|Entourage]]'' in 2010, in an episode of the [[TNT (U.S. TV network)|TNT]] incarnation of ''[[Dallas (2012 TV series)|Dallas]]'' titled "Truth and Consequences", which aired on July 4, 2012, in a series of commercials for the 2012 season of ESPN's ''[[Monday Night Football]]'', and in the season 4 premiere of ''[[The League]]''. In 2013, Jones narrated a documentary film on former teammate and business partner [[Jim Lindsey]].<ref>[http://jimlindseystory.com JimLindseyStory.com]. Retrieved May 3, 2013.</ref>

He was parodied on the first episode, "[[Go Fund Yourself]]", of the [[South Park (season 18)|eighteenth season of ''South Park'']], along with several other NFL team owners.
