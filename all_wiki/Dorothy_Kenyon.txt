'''Dorothy Kenyon''' (February 17, 1888 – February 12, 1972) was a [[New York (state)|New York]] [[attorney at law|attorney]], [[judge]], [[feminist]] and [[political activist]] in support of [[civil liberties]]. During the era of [[McCarthyism|McCarthyite]] persecution, she was accused of being affiliated with 28 [[communist]] front organizations. Kenyon was a charismatic speaker, and she regularly travelled throughout the U.S. lecturing about civil liberties, the law, and women's equality.

==Early life==
Kenyon was born in [[New York City]], to Maria Wellington (Stanwood) and William Houston Kenyon, a patent attorney.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|title=Collection: Dorothy Kenyon papers {{!}} Smith College Finding Aids|url=https://findingaids.smith.edu/repositories/2/resources/742|website=findingaids.smith.edu|access-date=2020-05-26}}  {{Cc-notice|cc=by3}}</ref> She grew up on the [[Upper West Side]] of [[Manhattan]], with a family summer home in [[Lakeville, Connecticut]]. She graduated from [[Horace Mann School]] in 1904. She studied [[economics]] and [[history]] at [[Smith College]], graduating in 1908. While at Smith she participated in [[hockey]] and [[tennis]], and was elected to [[Phi Beta Kappa]].<ref name=":0" /> Kenyon felt that she "misspent" the years 1908 to 1913 as a "social butterfly."<ref name=":1">{{Cite journal|last1=Weigand|first1=Kate|last2=Horowitz|first2=Daniel|date=2002-07-01|title=Dorothy Kenyon: Feminist Organizing, 1919-1963|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/17468|journal=Journal of Women's History|volume=14|issue=2|pages=126–131|doi=10.1353/jowh.2002.0058|s2cid=144986503|via=}}</ref> After spending a year in Mexico and observing poverty and injustice at a close range, she decided to focus on [[social activism]].<ref name=":0" /> She graduated from [[New York University]] School of Law in 1917 and was admitted to the New York Bar in the same year.<ref name=":1" />

== Career ==
Kenyon began her legal career in 1917 as a law clerk in the New York firm Gwinn and Deming.<ref name=":0" /> Later that year, she began work as a research specialist among the group of lawyers advising delegates to the [[Paris Peace Conference (1919–1920)|Paris Peace Conference]].<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|title=Kenyon, Dorothy (1888-1972), attorney, political activist, and judge|url=https://www.anb.org/view/10.1093/anb/9780198606697.001.0001/anb-9780198606697-e-1100489|last=Russell|first=Thaddeus|date=1999|website=American National Biography|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> As a research specialist, she studied wartime labor patterns and collected economic data for the conference. From 1919 to 1925, Kenyon worked for the firm of Pitkin, Rosenson, and Henderson in New York City.<ref name=":0" />

For most of her career, Kenyon devoted a great deal of her energy to advocating for social justice and a variety of liberal and progressive causes such as the [[New Deal]], Women's Rights, the Labor Movement, and [[consumer cooperative]]s. In 1930, Kenyon established the law firm of Straus and Kenyon with Dorothy Straus, with whom she worked in partnership to campaign for women's advancement until 1939, when she became a justice of the municipal court.<ref name=":0" /> Kenyon was appointed as a member of the [[New York City Comptroller]]'s council on taxes for the relief of the unemployed in 1934.<ref name=":0" /> In 1936 she chaired a committee to study procedure in women's courts where she called for more sympathetic treatment of sex workers and stronger prosecution of their clients and pimps.<ref name=":2" /> Kenyon gained national prominence as a feminist activist in 1938 when she was named the U.S. representative to the League of Nations Committee for the Study of the Status of Women, a group of seven lawyers charged with studying women's legal status internationally. World War II interrupted the committee's work and it was never completed. Kenyon resumed her commitment to improving women's status around the world through her work as the U.S. delegate to the United Nations Commission on the Status of Women from 1946-1950.<ref name=":0" />

Already well-known in academic, legal, and political circles, in 1950 Dorothy Kenyon made national news when Senator [[Joseph McCarthy|Joseph R. McCarthy]] named her as the first person to be investigated by the [[Tydings Committee]].<ref name=":2" />  McCarthy alleged that Kenyon had been a member of 29 [[Communist front]] organizations. Two "reliable former members of the Communist party" reportedly told McCarthy that "she had one job and one job only and that was to attach herself to a prominent individual... high in public life and try to influence the writings of that individual."<ref>{{Cite news|last=Leviero|first=Anthony|date=1954-07-28|title=M'CARTHY DEFENDS ONE-MAN INQUIRIES; Witnesses Got Fair Hearings, He Says, Opposing Curbs -- Ex-Justice Called a Red McCarthy Opposes Move to Ban One-Man Inquiries in the Senate|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1954/07/28/archives/mcarthy-defends-oneman-inquiries-witnesses-got-fair-hearings-he.html|url-status=live|access-date=2020-05-29|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> Kenyon responded aggressively to McCarthy's accusations by declaring: "He's a lowdown worm and although it ought to be beneath my dignity to answer him, I'm mad enough to say that he's a liar and he can go to hell."<ref name=":0" />  Of her involvement with communist organizations, she said "I am not, and never have been, a supporter of, a member of, or a sympathizer with any organization known to me to be, or suspected by me, of being controlled or dominated by Communists."<ref>{{Cite book|last=United States Congress|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=POCRNtikfTEC&q=%22I+am+not,+and+never+have+been,+a+supporter+of,+a+member+of,+or+a+sympathizer+with+any+organization+known+to+me+to+be,+or+suspected+by+me,+of+being+controlled+or+dominated+by+Communists.%22&pg=PA3594|title=Congressional Record: Proceedings and Debates of the 81st Congress Second Session|publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office|year=1950|isbn=|volume=96|location=|pages=3594|language=en|issue=3}}</ref> In the wake of her confrontation with McCarthy, Kenyon received widespread support from the press and from respected public figures such as [[Eleanor Roosevelt]].<ref name=":0" /> Although the [[United States Senate|Senate]] subcommittee cleared the charges against her on July 17, McCarthy's accusations ended Kenyon's career in public service.<ref>{{Cite book|last=|first=|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JoEuAAAAIAAJ&q=%E2%80%9CThe+evidence+before+this+subcommittee+fails+to+establish+that+Dorothy+Kenyon+is+a+Communist+or+an+otherwise+disloyal+person&pg=PA47|title=State Department Employee Loyalty Investigation: Report of the Committee of Foreign Relations|publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office|year=1950|isbn=|location=|pages=47|language=en}}</ref><ref name=":2" /><ref name=":1" />

During the 1950s and 1960s, Kenyon prepared briefs for the [[NAACP|National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] and worked for the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU).<ref name=":0" /> She continued to push the ACLU to take a stand against sexist policies and institutions, and was the sole woman on the board of the ACLU for many years. She worked with African-American activist and attorney, [[Pauli Murray]], on preparing briefs for cases that challenged sex discrimination in the 1940s and 1950s. She joined the pro [[Equal Rights Amendment]] forces, and also teamed with much younger feminists in the emerging [[Women's Liberation Movement]] where she participated in the 1971 [[Women's Strike for Equality]] and in the burgeoning movement to legalize abortion.<ref name=":0" />

In 1966, Murray and Dorothy Kenyon successfully argued ''[[White v. Crook]]'', a case in which the [[U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit]] ruled that women have an equal right to serve on juries.<ref name=WP>{{cite web |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-958315.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131011080701/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-958315.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=October 11, 2013 |title=Judge Ginsburg's Gift |author=Linda K.

Reed]]''&mdash;a 1971 Supreme Court case that for the first time extended the Fourteenth Amendment's [[Equal Protection Clause]] to women&mdash;she added Murray and Kenyon as coauthors in recognition of her debt to their work.<ref name=WP />

== Personal life ==
Kenyon had lengthy and intense romantic relationships with various men throughout her adult life, including Walcott Pitkin, Elihu Root Jr., and L.V. Pulsifer. Fiercely independent, she made a conscious decision not to marry.<ref name=":0" />

== Death ==
Kenyon participated in various aspects of President Johnson's [[War on Poverty]] and at age 80, she worked tirelessly and almost single-handedly to establish legal services for the poor on the Lower West Side of Manhattan. When Kenyon was diagnosed with [[stomach cancer]] in 1969, she concealed the severity of her illness from most people and refused to suspend or even curtail her legal or political work.<ref name=":0" /> She was an active advocate for social justice until her death on February 12, 1972, 5 days before her 84th birthday.<ref name="NYT">{{cite news|title=Judge Dorothy Kenyon Is Dead; Champion of Social Reform, 83|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1972/02/14/archives/judge-dorothy-kenyon-is-dead-champion-of-social-reform-83-legul.html|newspaper=The New York Times|date=February 14, 1972}}</ref>
