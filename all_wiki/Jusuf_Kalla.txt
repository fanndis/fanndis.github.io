'''Muhammad Jusuf Kalla''' ({{audio|Id-Jusuf Kalla.ogg|listen}}; born 15 May 1942) is an [[Indonesia]]n politician and businessman who served as the 10th and 12th [[Vice President of Indonesia]], the only vice president in Indonesian history to serve two non-consecutive terms in office (2004–2009 and 2014–2019).{{efn|He is therefore the only person to be counted twice in the numbering of the vice presidents.}} He was unsuccessful as [[Golkar]]'s presidential nominee in the [[2009 Indonesian presidential election|2009 presidential election]]. Before Kalla declared himself as the running mate for [[Joko Widodo]] in the [[2014 Indonesian presidential election|2014 presidential election]], a 2012 poll placed his popularity among likely voters in the top three contenders for the presidency<ref>{{cite news|last=Bagus BT |first=Saragih |title=Survey finds Golkar is popular, Aburizal not so much |url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/10/21/survey-finds-golkar-popular-aburizal-not-so-much.html |accessdate=31 December 2012 |newspaper=[[The Jakarta Post]] |date=21 October 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121219032615/http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/10/21/survey-finds-golkar-popular-aburizal-not-so-much.html |archivedate=19 December 2012 }}</ref> and ahead of his own party's nominee [[Aburizal Bakrie]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Will Kalla Beat Aburizal?|url=http://www.tempointeractive.com/hg/nasional/2012/11/28/brk,20121128-444526,uk.html|accessdate=31 December 2012|publisher=[[Tempo (Indonesian magazine)|Tempo]]|date=28 November 2012|author=Aryani Kristanti|author2=Nur Alfiyah|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130314030208/http://www.tempointeractive.com/hg/nasional/2012/11/28/brk,20121128-444526,uk.html|archive-date=14 March 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Since 2009 Kalla serves as the chairman of the [[Indonesian Red Cross Society]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Sore Ini JK Akhirnya Pulang Kampung|url=http://nasional.news.viva.co.id/news/read/107197-sore_ini_jk_akhirnya_pulang_kampung|accessdate=31 December 2012|work=Viva.co.id |date=19 November 2009|author=Elin Yunita Kristanti}}</ref>

==Early life==
Kalla was born on 15 May 1942 in [[Watampone]], now sits in [[South Sulawesi]]. His parents were Hadji Kalla, a local businessman and Athirah, a woman who sold [[Bugis|Buginese]] silk for a living.<ref name="autogenerated1">[https://web.archive.org/web/20110211040402/http://www.tokohindonesia.com/biografi/article/285-ensiklopedi/282-arsitek-pemulihan-ekonomi?start=1#content Jusuf Kalla, Petinggi Negara yang Sederhana | Biografi | Ensiklopedi Tokoh Indonesia]</ref> He was the second of 10 children.

After completing school, Kalla attended [[Hasanuddin University]] in [[Makassar]]. At university he became active in the Indonesian Student Action Front (KAMI), a student organization which supported General [[Suharto]] in his bid to gain power from president [[Sukarno]].  Kalla was elected as chair of South Sulawesi branch of KAMI.<ref name="autogenerated1" /> He showed interest in a political career, becoming a member of the Regional People's Representative Council (DPRD) and chairman of the Youth Division of Golkar when it was still organised under a Joint Secretariat (''Sekretariat Bersama'' or ''Sekber'') format.

==Businessman==
In 1967 Kalla graduated from the Economics Faculty at Hasanuddin University. The economic situation was bleak at the time and his father, Hadji Kalla, considered shutting down the family business, ''NV Hadji Kalla''.  Instead, Kalla decided to take over the firm.  Putting aside his political activities, in 1968 Kalla became CEO of ''NV Hadji Kalla'' while his father became chairman. In the beginning the business only had one employee and business was slow. Kalla's mother assisted by trading silk and running a small transportation business with three buses.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> Over time the business grew and became quite successful.  ''NV Hadji Kalla'' expanded from the export-import trading business into other sectors (hotels, infrastructure construction, car dealerships, aerobridges, shipping, real estate, transportation, a shrimp farm, oil palm, and telecommunications).<ref name=autogenerated1 /> In addition to being CEO of ''NV Hadji Kalla'', Kalla was also CEO of various subsidiaries of the firm.  In 1977, Kalla graduated from [[INSEAD]], an international business school in Fontainebleau, south of Paris. "NV Hadji Kalla" is now known as the Kalla Group and is one of the leading business groups in Indonesia, especially in Eastern Indonesia.

==Affiliations==
Aside from his business career, Kalla has been active in numerous well-known organizations. From 1979 to 1989, he was chairman of the Indonesian Economics Graduates Association (ISEI) in Makassar (known as Ujung Pandang at the time) and continues to be an adviser for ISEI. Kalla was extensively involved with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KADIN). From 1985 to 1998 he was chairman for KADIN in South Sulawesi and was coordinator for KADIN in eastern Indonesia.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> In addition, Kalla is on the board of trustees for three universities in Makassar. Kalla has contributed socially by building the Al Markaz Mosque and becoming chairman of its Islamic centre.

In 2015, the Jusuf Kalla School of Government at [[Muhammadiyah University of Yogyakarta]] was established, with the school being funded by Kalla.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Sahana |first1=Munarsih |title=Wapres Jusuf Kalla Resmikan JK School of Government di Yogyakarta |url=https://www.voaindonesia.com/a/wapres-jusuf-kalla-resmikan-jk-school-of-goverment-di-yogyakarta/2671355.html |accessdate=18 April 2019 |work=VOA Indonesia |date=7 March 2015}}</ref>

Kalla is seen in ''[[The Act of Killing]]'' film praising [[Pancasila Youth]] and encouraging them to commit violence.<ref>{{cite news|last=Bachelard|authorlink1=Michael Bachelard|first=Michael|title=Filmmaker fears reprisals for exposé on mass murders|url=http://www.smh.com.au/world/filmmaker-fears-reprisals-for-expos233-on-mass-murders-20121123-29ypj.html|accessdate=24 July 2013|newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=24 November 2012}}</ref>

==Political career==

===Member of the People's Consultative Assembly===
Kalla returned to active politics in 1987 when he was appointed to the [[People's Consultative Assembly]] (MPR) as a regional representative for South Sulawesi. He was re-appointed to the MPR in 1992, 1997, and 1999.<ref>Yayasan API, ''Panduan Parlelem Indonesia'' (''Indonesian Parliamentary Guide''), Jakarta, {{ISBN|979-96532-1-5}}</ref>

===Wahid and Megawati Presidency===
When Kyai Haji [[Abdurrahman Wahid]] (often known as ''Gus Dur'') was elected as president by the MPR in 1999, Kalla was included in the cabinet and became Minister of Industry and Trade. He had only been a minister for six months when in April 2000 Wahid removed him along with the Minister of State-Owned Enterprises. Wahid accused both Kalla and minister Laksamana of corruption, although he never produced evidence to support the charge,<ref>{{cite book  | last = Barton  | first = Greg  | title = Abdurrahman Wahid: Muslim Democrat, Indonesian President  | publisher = UNSW Press  | year = 2002  | location = Singapore  | isbn = 0-86840-405-5  | page = [https://archive.org/details/abdurrahmanwahid00bart/page/302 302]  | url-access = registration  | url = https://archive.org/details/abdurrahmanwahid00bart/page/302  }}</ref> and Kalla denied the allegations.<ref>{{cite web|title=5 things to know about Indonesian Vice-President Jusuf Kalla|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/5-things-to-know-about-indonesian-vice-president-jusuf-kalla|work=[[The Straits Times]]|accessdate=29 September 2015}}</ref>

In July 2001, at a special session of the MPR, President ''Gus Dur'' was dismissed from office. Vice President [[Megawati Sukarnoputri]] took over the presidency and included Kalla in her cabinet, appointing him to the senior post of Coordinating Minister of People's Welfare. Although it was not part of his ministerial brief, Kalla helped solve the inter-religious conflict in [[Poso]] on his native island of Sulawesi. Kalla facilitated the negotiation which resulted in the signing of the [[Malino II Accord]] on 20 December 2001<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20041130232806/http://www.tempointeraktif.com/hg/nasional/2001/12/20/brk,20011220-26,id.html Deklarasi Malino Mengakhiri Pertikaian di Poso]. Tempointeraktif.com (20 December 2001).</ref> and an end to the conflict which had gone on for three years. Two months later, Kalla helped solve another conflict in Sulawesi. On 12 February 2002, Kalla, together with Coordinating Minister of Politics and Society [[Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono]], managed to solve a similar conflict on [[Ambon Island|Ambon]] and [[Molucca]] through a second Malino Declaration.<ref>Eskol-Net&#93;- Hot Spot: "Deklarasi Malino untuk Maluku"</ref>

===Road to Vice Presidency===
Now a popular figure for assisting with the peace process in Sulawesi, Kalla considered putting himself forward as a candidate in the 2004 presidential elections. In August 2003 he announced his candidacy and enlisted as a participant in Golkar's 2004 Convention which would choose the Golkar candidate for president.<ref>[http://nasional.rimanews.com/politik/read/20150523/214555/Jusuf-Kalla-Berencana-Bahas-Teknis-Islah Rimanews] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150630183929/http://nasional.rimanews.com/politik/read/20150523/214555/Jusuf-Kalla-Berencana-Bahas-Teknis-Islah |date=30 June 2015 }}. Nasional Rimanews.</ref> As the months went by, however, Kalla came to be seen more as a vice presidential candidate. He was expected to partner a Javanese presidential candidate and his non-Javanese background was seen as a means of attracting non-Javanese votes which a Javanese candidate might have trouble getting.<ref>[http://www.suaramerdeka.com/harian/0407/02/nas02.htm Nasional] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927201935/http://www.suaramerdeka.com/harian/0407/02/nas02.htm |date=27 September 2007 }}. Suara Merdeka.</ref>

Just days before the Golkar national convention, Kalla decided to withdraw from running under the Golkar banner. Rather, he accepted the offer from the [[Democratic Party (Indonesia)|Democratic Party]]'s (PD) Yudhoyono to become his running mate.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/3638903.stm |work=BBC News | title=Blow to Megawati re-election bid | date=19 April 2004 | accessdate=7 May 2010}}</ref> The pair also received the support of the [[Crescent Star Party (Indonesia)|Crescent Star Party]] (PBB), the [[Indonesian Justice and Unity Party]] (PKPI), and [[Reform Star Party]] (PBR).

On 5 July 2004 the presidential election was held. Yudhoyono and Kalla won the popular vote with 33% of the votes but 50% of votes is required for election as president and vice president so a run-off was required. Yudhoyono and Megawati proceeded to the second election round held later in the year.

In the second ground Yudhoyono faced a considerable challenge from Megawati who formed a national coalition consisting of her own [[Indonesian Democratic Party-Struggle]] (PDI-P) along with Golkar, the [[United Development Party]], the [[Prosperous Peace Party]] (PDS), and the [[Indonesian National Party]] (PNI). Whilst Yudhoyono consolidated political support from other parties, Kalla turned to Golkar for support. Led by Fahmi Idris and ignoring the party line, pro-Kalla elements in Golkar declared their support for Kalla and Yudhoyono.<ref>[http://www.tempointeraktif.com/majalah/jap/cov-3.html Tempo Interaktif] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070102131153/http://www.tempointeraktif.com/majalah/jap/cov-3.html |date=2 January 2007 }}</ref> On 20 September 2004 Yudhoyono and Kalla won the run-off with 60.1% of the vote.

===First vice-presidential term===
[[File:Jusuf Kalla.jpg|120px|thumb|Official portrait of Kalla's first VP term]]
Although he had overwhelmingly won the Presidency, Yudhoyono was still weak in the [[People's Representative Council]] (DPR). PD with all of its coalition partners were still too weak to contend with the legislative muscles of Golkar and PDI-P who now intended to play the role of opposition.

With a National Congress to be held in December 2004, Yudhoyono and Kalla had originally backed head of DPR Agung Laksono to become Golkar Chairman. When Agung was perceived to be too weak to run against Akbar, Yudhoyono and Kalla threw their weight behind Surya Paloh. Finally, when Paloh was also perceived to be too weak to run against Akbar, Yudhoyono gave the green light for Kalla to run for the Golkar Chairmanship.<ref>[http://www.suaramerdeka.com/harian/0412/20/nas02.htm Nasional] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170402121625/http://www.suaramerdeka.com/harian/0412/20/nas02.htm |date=2 April 2017 }}. Suara Merdeka.</ref> On 19 December 2004, Kalla was elected as the new Chairman of Golkar.

Kalla's victory posed a dilemma for Yudhoyono. Although it now enabled Yudhoyono to pass legislation, Kalla's new position meant that in one sense, he was now more powerful than Yudhoyono.

The first sign of rivalry came during the Indian Ocean tsunami when Kalla, apparently on his own initiative, assembled the ministers and signed a vice presidential decree ordering work to begin on rehabilitating Aceh. The legality of the Vice Presidential decree was questioned<ref>{{cite book  | last = Redaksi Tempo | title = SBY-JK Duet Atau Duel: Edisi Khusus Setahun Pemerintahan SBY-JK | date = 24–30 October 2005 | location = Jakarta, Indonesia  | page = 41}}</ref> although Yudhoyono maintained that it was he who gave the orders for Kalla to proceed.

[[File:Vladimir Putin with Yusuf Kalla-1.jpg|right|thumb|Jusuf Kalla with Russian President (then Prime Minister), [[Vladimir Putin]]]]
The second sign was in September 2005 when Yudhoyono went to New York to attend the annual United Nations Summit. Although Yudhoyono had left Kalla to take charge of proceedings at Jakarta, he seemed to be bent on maintaining a watch on matters at home. Yudhoyono would hold a [[video conference]] from New York to receive reports from ministers. Critics suggested that such conduct was an expression of distrust by Yudhoyono<ref>{{cite book  | last = Redaksi Tempo | title = SBY-JK Duet Atau Duel: Edisi Khusus Setahun Pemerintahan SBY-JK | date = 24–30 October 2005 | location = Jakarta, Indonesia  | page = 40}}</ref> The suggestion seemed to gain momentum when Kalla only showed up for one video conference and then spent the rest of the time taking care of Golkar matters.

Although things calmed down, especially with Golkar gaining another cabinet position in the reshuffle, the alleged rivalry surfaced again in October 2006 when Yudhoyono established the Presidential Work Unit for the Organization of Reform Program (UKP3R). Critics questioned whether the establishment of the unit was an attempt by Yudhoyono to exclude Kalla from the government. Yudhoyono was quick to clarify that in supervising UKP3R, he would be assisted by Kalla.<ref>[https://archive.today/20090430193850/http://www.tokohindonesia.com/ensiklopedi/s/susilo-b-yudhoyono/berita/2006/ukp3r.shtml Presiden SBY: UKP3R Dipertahankan | Berita Tokoh Indonesia]</ref>

===Potential presidential candidacy in 2014===
Kalla has been often mentioned as a possible nominee of the [[Golkar|Golkar Party]] in the 2014 presidential race.<ref name="antaranews1">{{cite news |title= Jusuf Kalla ready to run for president in 2014 |url=http://www.antaranews.com/en/news/79646/jusuf-kalla-ready-to-run-for-president-in-2014 |newspaper=[[Antara (news agency)]] |date=3 February 2012 |accessdate=1 March 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Jusuf Kalla may run for president, Golkar says |url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/02/29/jusuf-kalla-may-run-president-golkar-says.html |newspaper=[[The Jakarta Post]] |date=1 March 2012 |accessdate=1 March 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120304002550/http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/02/29/jusuf-kalla-may-run-president-golkar-says.html |archivedate= 4 March 2012 }}</ref> In 2009 Kalla ran in the [[2009 Indonesian presidential election|Indonesian presidential election]] with former [[Indonesian National Armed Forces|Armed Forces]] [[Chief of Staff]] [[Wiranto]] as his running mate, finishing third with 12.4% of the vote.

During a dedication ceremony of the [[Indonesian Red Cross Society|Indonesian Red Cross]] headquarters in the [[Riau]] province on 3 February 2012 Kalla stated his willingness to run in the presidential election in 2014 should he receive sufficient public support.<ref name="antaranews1"/> By May 2012 however, Kalla stated that he had no intention of running in the [[2014 Indonesian presidential election|2014 Presidential election]]. Kalla said he had no hard feelings about party chairman [[Aburizal Bakrie|Aburizal Bakrie's]] upcoming inauguration as presidential candidate for the Golkar Party and that he had no intention of competing with him despite surveys that showed that Kalla was likely to be more electable than Bakrie.<ref>{{cite news|title=I have no intention of running for president |author=[[Staff writer]] |url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/05/29/i-have-no-intention-running-president-jk.html |newspaper=[[The Jakarta Post]] |date=29 May 2012 |accessdate=4 July 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120701175335/http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/05/29/i-have-no-intention-running-president-jk.html |archivedate= 1 July 2012 }}</ref> During Golkar's National Leadership meeting in [[Bogor]] on 29 June 2012, Bakrie was officially declared the Golkar Party's 2014 [[Presidential candidate]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Golkar chairman Aburizal Bakrie to run for president |author=Zakir Hussain |url=http://www.straitstimes.com/print/BreakingNews/SEAsia/Story/STIStory_816917.html# |newspaper=[[Strait Times|The Straits Times]] |date=30 June 2012 |accessdate=4 July 2012}}</ref>

Nevertheless, in the changeable political scene in Indonesia the situation can be expected to evolve in the preparations for the 2014 presidential election.  In late 2012 Jusuf Kalla indicated that he would be prepared to move away from Golkar and join a ticket sponsored by the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P) with former president Megawati as candidate for president and him as the vice-presidential candidate. "If I am not representing Golkar Party, then I have no objection ... Everything is possible in politics," Kalla said.<ref>Rabby Pramudatama, '[http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/11/26/kalla-ready-dump-golkar-and-be-vp-candidate-megawati.html Kalla ready to dump Golkar and be VP candidate for Megawati'], ''The Jakarta Post'', 26 November 2012.</ref>

===Jokowi's running mate===

Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDIP)'s presidential candidate Joko Widodo announced Jusuf Kalla as his vice presidential running mate at Gedung Juang, Jakarta, on 19 May 2014.<ref>Fikri Fakih, [http://www.merdeka.com/politik/pdip-gedung-joang-dipilih-karena-jokowi-memulai-orde-perjuangan.html PDIP: Gedung Joeang Dipilih Karena Jokowi Memulai Orde Perjuangan], ''Merdeka.com'', 19 May 2014</ref>

[[File:Mike Pence in Indonesia.jpg|thumb|U.S. Vice President [[Mike Pence]] meeting with Kalla and Cabinet Ministers, 20 April 2017]]
During his second term as vice president, Kalla criticized neighbor nations [[Malaysia]] and [[Singapore]] for airing their concerns about suffering from [[Southeast Asian haze|the repeated haze caused by Indonesian forest fires]], stating in March 2015: "For 11 months, they enjoyed nice air from Indonesia and they never thanked us. They have suffered because of the haze for one month and they get upset."<ref>{{cite web|title=VP Kalla Slams Neighboring Countries Over Haze Complaints|url=http://jakartaglobe.beritasatu.com/news/vp-kalla-slams-neighboring-countries-over-haze-complaints|work=[[Jakarta Globe]]|accessdate=26 September 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150926020547/http://jakartaglobe.beritasatu.com/news/vp-kalla-slams-neighboring-countries-over-haze-complaints/|archivedate=26 September 2015|date=3 March 2015|last1=Setuningsih|first1=Novianti}}</ref> During the [[2015 Southeast Asian haze]] crisis in September, Kalla restated a similar position, while further questioning "why should there be an apology" from Indonesia.

He scolded foreign companies, saying "You take [Indonesian products], and pay $5, and you bring it here, and sell for $100. Indonesian companies just get $5 ... you have to pay, if not we will cut down all the trees, and let the world feel the heat ... The world has to pay for all of this. Don't always accuse Indonesia." He also reiterated that since Singapore and Malaysia did not thank Indonesia for "fresh air from Sumatra, Kalimantan", then there was no need for Indonesia to apologize for haze from Indonesian forest fires.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Ismail|first1=Saifulbahri|title=Indonesia VP blames foreign countries for destroying forests|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asiapacific/indonesia-vp-blames-foreign-countries-for-destroying-forests/3332302.html|publisher=[[Channel News Asia]]|accessdate=1 December 2016}}</ref>

In February 2016, Kalla told the [[United Nations Development Programme]] not to finance or carry out an [[LGBT]] ([[lesbian]], [[gay]], [[bisexuality|bisexual]], and [[transgender]]) community program in Indonesia. Kalla previously stated opposition to LGBT campaigns in Indonesia, which he considered at that point as deviating from social values.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2016/02/15/kalla-requests-undp-not-fund-lgbt-groups.html|title=Kalla requests UNDP to not fund LGBT groups|accessdate=2 February 2016|work=[[The Jakarta Post]]}}</ref>

In April 2016, Kalla reportedly criticized how Singapore, "never wants to sign" an extradition agreement with Indonesia, despite Singapore supposedly being the "country where the largest number of" Indonesian fugitives had fled. The [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Singapore)|Singaporean Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] responded by pointing out that an Indonesia-Singapore extradition treaty cum defence cooperation pact had been signed in 2007,<ref>{{cite web|last1=Greenlees|first1=Donald|title=Indonesia and Singapore sign two landmark treaties|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/27/world/asia/27iht-indo.3.5474698.html?_r=0|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=25 April 2016}}</ref> while Kalla was also Vice President, but the treaty was still pending ratification by the [[People's Representative Council|Indonesian House of Representatives]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Arshad|first1=Arlina|title=Kalla's comments 'incorrect, misleading'|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/kallas-comments-incorrect-misleading|website=[[The Straits Times]]|accessdate=25 April 2016}}</ref> The Indonesian House had rejected the dual agreement in 2013 as "not favourable to Indonesia", maintaining that "extradition and defence are two separate issues".<ref>{{cite web|title=Indonesia's House wants extradition treaty with S'pore|url=http://news.asiaone.com/news/asia/indonesias-house-wants-extradition-treaty-spore|publisher=AsiaOne|accessdate=25 April 2016}}</ref>

In December 2018, the issue of [[People's Republic of China|China]]'s [[Xinjiang re-education camps]] and human rights abuses against the [[Uyghurs|Uyghur]] [[Islam in China|Muslim]] minority was brought up in parliament. Kalla said: "we don't want to intervene in the domestic affairs of another country."<ref>{{cite news |title=Why Muslim nations remain silent as China sends ethnic minorities to re-education camps |url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-12-23/muslim-governments-stayed-silent-on-chinese-minority-uyghur/10630822 |publisher=ABC News |date=23 December 2018}}</ref>
