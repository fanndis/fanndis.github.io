The Club's emblem is the Owl, in deference to wisdom, awareness and nights spent working.

==History==
===Founding===
On March 12, 1908, 32 [[newspaper]]men met at the Washington Chamber of Commerce to discuss starting a club for journalists.  At the meeting they agreed to meet again on March 29 in the F Street [[parlor]] of the [[Willard InterContinental Washington|Willard Hotel]] to frame a [[constitution]] for the National Press Club. The Club founders laid down a credo which promised "to promote social enjoyment among the members, to cultivate literary taste, to encourage friendly intercourse among newspapermen and those with whom they were thrown in contact in the pursuit of their [[vocation]], to aid members in distress and to foster the [[Journalism ethics and standards|ethical standards of the profession]]."

With $300, the founding members moved into its first club quarters on the second floor of 1205 F Street NW. By 1909, the club had outgrown its new quarters and moved above Rhodes Tavern at the corner of 15th and F Streets. Once again the club outgrew its residence and moved to the Albee Building (formerly Riggs) at 15th and G Streets.

===Membership===
The National Press Club was founded by, and for a time was open exclusively to, [[White people|white]] male journalists. Female journalists founded a '''Women's National Press Club''' in 1919, and [[African-American]] journalists founded the [[Capital Press Club]] in 1944. The first African-American male journalist was accepted for National Press Club membership in 1955.  In December 1970, members of the Women's National Press Club voted to allow men into their club and renamed it the '''Washington Press Club'''. The next month, the National Press Club voted 227 to 56 to admit women. In 1972, journalist [[Gloria Steinem]], a [[Second-wave feminism|feminist leader]] and founder of ''[[Ms. (magazine)|Ms.]]'' magazine, was the first woman to speak at the National Press Club,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/she-the-people/wp/2013/11/19/gloria-steinem-no-such-thing-as-a-feminist-icon/|title=Gloria Steinem: No such thing as a 'feminist icon'|website=Washington Post|access-date=2016-11-17}}</ref> although first lady [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] attended lunch at the then all-male club in 1938.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www2.gwu.edu/~erpapers/myday/displaydoc.cfm?_y=1938&_f=md055071|title=My Day, September 29, 1938|author=Eleanor Roosevelt|author-link=Eleanor Roosevelt|work=The Eleanor Roosevelt Papers Digital Edition|edition=2008|access-date=2016-11-17}}</ref> In 1985, the Washington Press Club and the National Press Club merged under the banner of the National Press Club.<ref>{{cite web |title=History of the WPCF: 1980s–Present |url=http://wpcf.org/history-of-the-wpcf/#1980s |publisher={{no selflink|Washington Press Club Foundation}} |date=2011| accessdate=January 24, 2017}}</ref>

'''The Washington Press Club Foundation''' (WPCF) continues as a nonprofit organization to promote equality, education and excellence among journalists in print and broadcast media. It has a '''Women in Journalism Oral History Project''', arranges journalism internships for women and minorities  in partnership with Washington DC-based news bureaus, and since 1945 an Annual Congressional Dinner, its signature fundraising event.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.wpcf.org/about-us/ | title=About | publisher=Washington Press Club Foundation | accessdate=April 11, 2017}}</ref>

===National Press Building===
[[File:Nationalpressbuilding1.jpg|thumb|National Press Building]]
In 1925, National Press Club President Henry L. Sweinhart, appointed a special building committee to plan for a permanent club [[headquarters]]. The Ebbitt Hotel was demolished, and the [[Old Ebbitt Grill|Ebbitt Grill]] moved to the [[Chase's Theater and Riggs Building|Albee building]]. The new National Press Building, at 14th and F Streets NW, was completed in August 1927, and included retail space and office space intended for Washington [[news bureau]]s, with the club occupying the 13th and 14th floors. In order to increase their funding, the club made a deal with movie studio [[20th Century Fox]] to build a [[theater]] as part of the building.

In 1932, [[Bascom N. Timmons]], who established an independent news bureau in Washington, D.C., became president of the Press Club. He worked to save the press club building in [[New York City]] from foreclosure by persuading President Franklin Roosevelt to sign an amendment to the federal [[bankruptcy]] law that blocked pending foreclosure and kept the building open.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/06/08/obituaries/bascom-timmons-97-washington-reporter.html|title=Bascom N. Timmons, 97, Washington reporter|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=August 30, 2013|date=June 8, 1987}}</ref>

The National Press Building was renovated from 1984 to 1985,<ref name=CPsells /> in conjunction with the development of the adjacent [[The Shops at National Place]]. Beginning in 2004, a 10-year, $15 million second renovation occurred.<ref name=CassidyTurleysells>{{cite news|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/washington/breaking_ground/2014/08/the-news-churn-national-press-building-up-for-sale.html|last=Sernovitz|first=Daniel J.|title=The News Churn: National Press Building Up for Sale, Again|newspaper=Washington Business Journal|date=August 8, 2014|accessdate=August 11, 2014}}</ref> In 2011, the building was sold to Quadrangle Development Corp. and AEW Core Property Trust (U.S.) for $167.5 million.<ref name=CPsells>{{cite news|url=http://www.cpexecutive.com/regions/mid-atlantic/d-c-s-iconic-national-press-building-trades-for-167-5m/|last=Murray|first=Barbra|title=D.C.'s Iconic National Press Building Trades for $167.5M|newspaper=Commercial Property Executive|date=June 28, 2011|accessdate=August 11, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/washington/news/2011/06/28/national-press-building-sells-for.html|last=Clabaugh|first=Jeff|title=National Press Building Sells for $167.5M|newspaper=Washington Business Journal|date=June 28, 2011|accessdate=August 11, 2014}}</ref> The owners placed the building, assessed at $237.5 million, up for sale in August 2014.<ref name=CassidyTurleysells />

The National Press Club also rents space to other organizations.<ref>[http://press.org/facilities/meetingrooms.cfm National Press Club website] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090929093743/http://www.press.org/facilities/meetingrooms.cfm |date=2009-09-29 }}.

===Continuation===
During the [[Great Depression]], the Club struggled financially as it was beginning to be recognized as an influential group. It managed to find additional funding from wealthy individuals.

Regular weekly [[luncheon]]s for speakers began in 1932 with an appearance by [[president-elect]] [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]. Since then the Club has hosted an average of 70 luncheons each year with prominent people. Over the years [[Nikita Khrushchev]], [[Soong Mei-ling]] (Madame Chiang Kai-shek), [[Golda Meir]], [[Indira Gandhi]], [[Muhammad Ali]], [[Charles de Gaulle]], [[Robert Redford]], [[Boris Yeltsin]], [[Elizabeth Taylor]], [[Nelson Mandela]], [[Yasser Arafat]], [[Tenzin Gyatso, 14th Dalai Lama|Dalai Lama]], [[Angelina Jolie]], [[George Carlin]], [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]], and [[Elizabeth Warren]] have all spoken at the club.

Speaking at the National Press Club to mark his retirement, CBS commentator [[Eric Sevareid]] called the club the "''sanctum sanctorum'' of American journalists" and said "It's the [[Palace of Westminster#Westminster Hall|Westminster Hall]], it's [[Delphi]], it's [[Mecca]], the [[Western Wall|Wailing Wall]] for everybody in this country having anything to do with the news business; the only hallowed place I know of that's absolutely bursting with irreverence."

The Broadcast Operations Center opened in 2006. Located on the 4th floor of the National Press Building,  a full-service video production  with facilities for webcast and video conference solutions, video production capabilities, global transmission portals, and web enabled multimedia.

The '''National Press Club Journalism Institute''', the non-profit arm of the National Press Club, trains communications professionals in a changing media environment, provides scholarships to  the next generation of journalists, recognizes excellence in journalism, and promotes a free press.
