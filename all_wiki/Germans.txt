==Etymology==
{{further|Names of Germany|Germani|Germania}}
[[File:Germanic limes.jpg|thumb|Roman limes and modern boundaries.]]
The German term ''[[:wikt:Deutsche|Deutsche]]'' originates from the [[Old High German]] word ''[[diutisc]]'' (from ''diot'' "people"), referring to the [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] "language of the people". It is not clear how commonly, if at all, the word was used as an ethnonym in Old High German.

Used as a noun, ''ein diutscher'' in the sense of "a German" emerges in [[Middle High German]], attested from the second half of the 12th century.<ref>
e.g. [[Walther von der Vogelweide]]. See [[Matthias von Lexer|Lexer]], ''Mittelhochdeutsches Handwörterbuch'' (1872–1878), s.v. "Diutsche".
The Middle High German [[Song of Roland]] (ca. 1170) has  ''in diutisker erde'' (65.6) for "in the German realm, in Germany".
The phrase ''in tütschem land'', whence the modern ''[[Deutschland]]'', is attested in the late 15th century (e.g. [[Johann Geiler von Kaysersberg]], [[Ship of Fools (satire)|Ship of Fools]], see Grimm, ''[[Deutsches Wörterbuch]]'', s.v. "Deutsch").</ref>

The [[Old French]] term ''alemans'' is taken from the name of the [[Alamanni]]. It was loaned into [[Middle English]] as ''almains'' in the early 14th century. The word ''Dutch'' is attested in English from the 14th century, denoting continental West Germanic ("Dutch" and "German") dialects and their speakers.<ref>''OED'', s.v. [http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/58711?rskey=gu9Opa] "Dutch, adj., n., and adv."</ref>

While in most [[Romance languages]] the Germans have been named from the Alamanni (in what became [[Swabia]]) (some, like standard [[Italian language|Italian]] ''tedeschi'', retain an older borrowing of the [[exonym and endonym|endonym]], while the [[Romanian language|Romanian]] 'germani' stems from the historical correlation with the ancient region of [[Germania]]), the [[Old Norse]], [[Finnish language|Finnish]], and [[Estonian language|Estonian]] names for the Germans were taken from that of the [[Saxons]]. In [[Slavic languages]], the Germans were given the name of ''{{lang|sla|němьci}}'' (singular ''{{lang|sla|němьcь}}''), originally meaning "mute."

The English term ''Germans'' is only attested from the mid-16th century, based on the classical Latin term ''Germani'' used by [[Julius Caesar]] and later [[Tacitus]]. It gradually replaced ''Almain'', the most common term found in [[Middle English]] and [[Early Modern English|late-15th century]] texts, by the [[18th century]]; the latter having already marginalised the less common medieval variants of the modern word "Dutch".<ref>{{cite book |last=Schulze |first=Hagen |author-link=Hagen Schulze |title=Germany: A New History |publisher=Harvard University Press |page=[https://archive.org/details/germany00hage/page/4 4] |year=1998 |isbn=0-674-80688-3 |url=https://archive.org/details/germany00hage/page/4 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?subview=Main&entry=t27.e6407 "German"], ''The Concise Oxford Dictionary of English Etymology''.

==History==
{{Main|History of Germany|Germanic peoples|Theodiscus}}
The Germans are a Germanic people, who as an ethnicity emerged during the Middle Ages. Originally part of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], around 300 independent German states emerged during its decline after the [[Peace of Westphalia]] in 1648 ending the [[Thirty Years War]], with Austria and Prussia-Brandenburg being the largest. These states, except for Austria and the Czech lands which it controlled, the Spanish Netherlands (most of which eventually became Belgium), Liechtenstein, and lands west of the Upper Rhine River (over time added to France) eventually formed into [[German Empire|modern Germany]] in the 19th century.<ref>See:

===Origins===
[[File:West Germanic Kingdoms 460.jpg|thumb|right|Germanic Kingdoms in Europe {{circa}} 500 AD]]

Although there is little substantial proof, the concept of a German ethnicity is linked to Germanic tribes of antiquity in central Europe.<ref name="Its Peoples 2009. Pp. 311">World and Its Peoples. Marshall Cavendish, 2009. Pp. 311.</ref> The early Germans originated on the [[North German Plain]] as well as southern Scandinavia.<ref name="Its Peoples 2009.

The Germans: Absent Nationality and the Holocaust. SUSSEX ACADEMIC PRESS, 2010. Pp. 27.</ref>

In the [[European Iron Age]] the area that is now Germany was divided into the ([[Celts|Celtic]]) [[La Tène culture|La Tène horizon]] in [[Southern Germany]] and the ([[Germanic peoples|Germanic]]) [[Jastorf culture]] in [[Northern Germany]]. By 55 BC, the Germans{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} had reached the Danube river and had either assimilated or otherwise driven out the Celts who had lived there, and had spread west into what is now Belgium and France.<ref name="Yehuda Cohen 2010. Pp. 27"/>

Conflict between the Germanic tribes and the forces of [[ancient Rome|Rome]] under [[Julius Caesar]] forced major Germanic tribes to retreat to the east bank of the [[Rhine]].<ref name="Its Peoples 2009. Pp. 311-312">World and Its Peoples. Marshall Cavendish, 2009.

Pp. 311"/> Germanic peoples in Roman territory were culturally Romanized, and although much of Germania remained free of direct Roman rule, Rome deeply influenced the development of German society, especially the adoption of Christianity by the Germans who obtained it from the Romans.<ref name="Its Peoples 2009.

Pp. 212.</ref> The adoption of Christianity would later become a major influence in the development of a common German identity.<ref name="Yehuda Cohen 2010. Pp. 27"/>

The first major public figure to speak of a German{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} people in general, was the Roman figure [[Tacitus]] in his work ''Germania'' around 100 AD.<ref name="Jeffrey E.

The Germanic peoples during the [[Migration Period|Migrations Period]] came into contact with other peoples; in the case of the populations settling in the territory of modern Germany, they encountered [[Celts]] to the south, and [[Balts]] and [[Slavs]] towards the east. The ''[[Limes Germanicus]]'' was breached in AD 260. Migrating Germanic tribes commingled with the local [[Gallo-Roman]] populations in what is now [[Swabia]] and [[Bavaria]]. The arrival of the [[Huns]] in Europe resulted in Hun conquest of large parts of Eastern Europe, the Huns initially were allies of the Roman Empire who fought against Germanic tribes, but later the Huns cooperated with the Germanic tribe of the Ostrogoths, and large numbers of Germans lived within the lands of the [[Huns#Unified Empire under Attila|Hunnic Empire]] of [[Attila]].<ref name="Ostrogoths Pp. 46">A History of the Ostrogoths.

The migration-period peoples who later coalesced into a "German" ethnicity were the Germanic tribes of the [[Saxons]], [[Franks|Franci]], [[Thuringii]], [[Alamanni]] and many of the [[Bavarii]]. These five tribes, sometimes with inclusion of the [[Frisians]], are considered as the major groups to take part in the formation of the Germans.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} By the 9th century, the large tribes which lived on the territory of modern Germany had been united under the rule of the Frankish king [[Charlemagne]], known in German as Karl der Große.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.historyworld.net/wrldhis/plaintexthistories.asp?historyid=aa20|title=HISTORY OF CHARLEMAGNE|website=Historyworld.net|accessdate=29 March 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.livescience.com/4892-charlemagne-changed-world.html|title=How Charlemagne Changed the World|work=LiveScience.com|accessdate=29 March 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegelgeschichte/wie-karl-der-grosse-aachen-zur-kaiserlichen-metropole-ausbaute-a-872076.html|title=Wie Karl der Große Aachen zur kaiserlichen Metropole ausbaute|author=SPIEGEL ONLINE, Hamburg, Germany|date=26 November 2012|work=SPIEGEL ONLINE|accessdate=7 January 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Schwanitz |first=Dietrich |title=Bildung.

A German ethnicity emerged in the course of the [[Middle Ages]], ultimately as a result of the formation of the [[Kingdom of Germany]] within [[East Francia]] and later the [[Holy Roman Empire]], beginning in the 9th century. The process was gradual and lacked any clear definition, and the use of exonyms designating "the Germans" develops only during the [[High Middle Ages]]. The title of ''rex teutonicum'' "[[King of the Germans]]" is first used in the late 11th century, by the chancery of [[Pope Gregory VII]], to describe the future Holy Roman Emperor of the German nation [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B84ZaAdGbS4C&q=rex+teutonicorum+Pope+Gregory+VII&pg=PA18|title=Germany|page=18|accessdate=29 March 2015|isbn=9780674005457|last1=Schulze|first1=Hagen|year=2001}}</ref> Natively, the term ''diutscher'' (German) was used for the people of Germany beginning in the 12th century.

After [[Christianization of the Germanic peoples|Christianization]], the Roman Catholic Church and local rulers led German expansion and settlement in areas inhabited by Slavs and Balts, known as [[Ostsiedlung]]. During the wars waged in the Baltic by the Catholic German [[Teutonic Knights]]; the lands inhabited by the ethnic group of the [[Old Prussians]] (known then simply as "Prussians"), were conquered by the Germans. The Old Prussians were an ethnic group related to the [[Latvians|Latvian]] and [[Lithuanians|Lithuanian]] Baltic peoples.<ref>Ulrich Ammon, Norbert Dittmar, Klaus J. Mattheier.

At the same time, naval innovations led to a German domination of trade in the [[Baltic Sea]] and parts of Eastern Europe through the [[Hanseatic League]]. Along the trade routes, Hanseatic trade stations became centers of the German culture. [[German town law]] ''(Stadtrecht)'' was promoted by the presence of large, relatively wealthy German populations, their influence and political power. Thus people who would be considered "Germans", with a common culture, language, and [[worldview]] different from that of the surrounding rural peoples, colonized trading towns as far north of present-day Germany as [[Bergen, Norway|Bergen]] (in [[Norway]]), [[Stockholm]] (in [[Sweden]]), and [[Vyborg]] (now in Russia). The Hanseatic League was not exclusively German in any ethnic sense: many towns who joined the league were outside the Holy Roman Empire and a number of them may only loosely be characterized as ''German''. The Empire itself was not entirely German either. It had a multi-ethnic and multi-lingual structure, some of the smaller ethnicities existing and languages used at different times in certain areas were Dutch (also a West Germanic language which was similar to German dialects spoken to the east of it), Italian, French, Czech, and Polish.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dhm.de/ausstellungen/heiliges-roemisches-reich/index_3.html|title=Heiliges Römisches Reich Deutscher Nation|website=Dhm.de|accessdate=29 March 2015}}</ref>

By the [[Middle Ages]], large numbers of [[Jews]] lived in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] and had assimilated into German culture, including many Jews who had previously assimilated into French culture and had spoken a mixed Judeo-French language.<ref name="Ulrich Ammon 2006">Ulrich Ammon, Norbert Dittmar, Klaus J.

===Early Modern period===
[[File:Holy Roman Empire 1648.svg|thumb|left|The [[Holy Roman Empire]] after the [[Peace of Westphalia]], 1648]]

From the late 15th century, the Holy Roman Empire came to be known as the [[Holy Roman Empire of the German nation]]. The [[Thirty Years' War]], a series of conflicts fought mainly in the territory of modern Germany, weakened the coherence of the Holy Roman Empire, leading to the emergence of different, smaller German states known as ''[[Kleinstaaterei]]'' in [[18th-century Germany]].

The [[Napoleonic Wars]] were the cause of the final dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire, and ultimately the cause for the quest for a German [[nation state]] in 19th-century [[German nationalism]]. After the [[Congress of Vienna]], [[Austrian Empire|Austria]] and [[Prussia]] emerged as two competitors within the German realm. Austria, trying to remain the dominant power in Central Europe, led the way in the terms of the Congress of Vienna. The Congress of Vienna was essentially conservative, assuring that little would change in Europe and preventing Germany from uniting.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.colby.edu/personal/r/rmscheck/GermanyA3.html|title=Raffael Scheck's Web Page » Raffael Scheck's Home Page|website=Colby.edu|accessdate=29 March 2015}}</ref> These terms came to a sudden halt following the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|Revolutions of 1848]] and the [[Crimean War]] in 1856, paving the way for [[German Unification|the unification of most of Germany]] in the 1860s. By the 1820s, large numbers of Jewish German women had intermarried with Christian German men and had converted to Christianity.<ref>Deborah Sadie Hertz.

Crown Prince Friedrich, later [[Frederick III, German Emperor|Friedrich III]], stands on his father's right.]]

German nationalism became the sole focus of the [[German Question]] which was the question of how Germany was going to be best unified into a nation-state. The idea of unifying all German-speakers into one state was known as the Großdeutsche Lösung ("Greater German solution") and was propagated mostly by the Austrian Empire and the German Austrians. The other option, the Kleindeutsche Lösung ("Little German solution") only advocated unifying the northern German states without Austria and the German Austrians was supported predominantly in the [[Kingdom of Prussia]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Dirk Verheyen|title=The German Question: A Cultural, Historical, and Geopolitical Exploration|date=30 July 1999|publisher=Avalon Publishing|isbn=978-0-8133-6878-8|page=8}}</ref> The idea of including the Austrian Empire into a German nation-state was a problem because it included many non-German ethnic groups and many areas which had never been part of the Holy Roman Empire or the later German Federations and did not want to become part of a German nation-state.<ref>{{cite book|author=Imanuel Geiss|title=The Question of German Unification: 1806-1996|date=16 December 2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-18568-7|page=41}}</ref> In 1866, the [[Austro-Prussian War|feud between Austria and Prussia]] finally came to a head. In the final battle of the German war (''[[Battle of Königgrätz]]'') the Prussians defeated the Austrians and proceeded to create the [[North German Confederation]] with some south German states, including Austria, remaining independent.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onwar.com/aced/data/sierra/sevenweeks1866.htm |title=Austria-Hungary Prussia War 1866 |publisher=Onwar.com |date=16 December 2000 |accessdate=2 August 2012}}</ref>

In 1870, after France attacked Prussia, Prussia and its new allies in Southern Germany (among them Bavaria but excluding Austria) were victorious in the [[Franco-Prussian War]]. Prussia created the [[German Empire]] in 1871 as a German [[nation-state]], excluding the multi-ethnic Austrian [[Habsburg monarchy]] and [[Liechtenstein]]. Integrating the Austrian Germans, including Germans in the Czech Kingdom ruled by the Austrian Empire, into the German nation-state nevertheless remained a strong desire for many people of Germany and Austria, especially among the liberals, the social democrats and also the Catholics who were a minority within the Protestant Germany.

During the 19th century, rapid population growth due to lower death rates in Germany, combined with poverty, spurred millions of Germans to emigrate, chiefly to the United States. Today, roughly 17% of the United States' population (23% of the [[White American|white]] population) is of mainly German ancestry.<ref name="US Census Bureau, German ancestry">{{cite web|url=http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/ADPTable?_bm=y&-geo_id=01000US&-ds_name=ACS_2006_EST_G00_&-_lang=en&-_caller=geoselect&-format=|title=American FactFinder - Search|website=Factfinder.census.gov|accessdate=20 December 2017|archive-url=https://archive.today/20200211183329/http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/ADPTable?_bm=y&-geo_id=01000US&-ds_name=ACS_2006_EST_G00_&-_lang=en&-_caller=geoselect&-format=|archive-date=11 February 2020|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name="Census 2008 ACS Ancestry estimates">{{cite web|url=http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/ADPTable?_bm=y&-qr_name=ACS_2008_1YR_G00_DP2&-geo_id=01000US&-ds_name=ACS_2008_1YR_G00_&-_lang=en&-redoLog=false&-format=|title=American FactFinder - Results|first=U.S. Census|last=Bureau|website=Factfinder.census.gov|accessdate=20 December 2017|archive-url=https://archive.today/20200211183717/http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/ADPTable?_bm=y&-qr_name=ACS_2008_1YR_G00_DP2&-geo_id=01000US&-ds_name=ACS_2008_1YR_G00_&-_lang=en&-redoLog=false&-format=|archive-date=11 February 2020|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name="legis.state.pa.us">{{cite web|url=http://www.legis.state.pa.us/CFDOCS/Legis/PN/Public/btCheck.cfm?txtType=HTM&sessYr=2009&sessInd=0&billBody=S&billTyp=R&billNbr=0141&pn=1216|title=Regular Session 2009-2010 Senate Resolution 141 P.N. 1216 |website=Legis.state.pa.us|accessdate=29 March 2015}}</ref>

After World War II, Eastern European countries such as the [[Soviet Union]], [[Poland]], [[Czechoslovakia]], [[Hungary]], [[Romania]], and [[Yugoslavia]] expelled the ethnic Germans from their territories.

Germans were also forced to leave the [[former eastern territories of Germany]], which were annexed by Poland ([[Silesia]], eastern [[Pomerania]], parts of [[Brandenburg]] and the southern part of [[East Prussia]]) and the [[Soviet Union]] (northern part of [[East Prussia]]).

===Literature===
{{Main|German literature}}
[[File:Printing3 Walk of Ideas Berlin.JPG|upright|thumb|[[Walk of Ideas]], Berlin, a sculpture honoring [[Johannes Gutenberg]] and some of Germany's most influential writers]]

German literature can be traced back to the [[Middle Ages]], with the most notable authors of the period being [[Walther von der Vogelweide]] and [[Wolfram von Eschenbach]]. The ''[[Nibelungenlied]]'', whose author remains unknown, is also an important work of the epoch, as is the ''[[Thidrekssaga]]''. The fairy tales collections collected and published by [[Brothers Grimm|Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm]] in the 19th century became famous throughout the world.

Theologian [[Martin Luther|Luther]], who translated the Bible into German, is widely credited for having set the basis for the modern "High German" language. Among the most admired German poets and authors are [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing|Lessing]], [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]], [[Friedrich Schiller|Schiller]], [[Heinrich von Kleist|Kleist]], [[E.T.A. Hoffmann|Hoffmann]], [[Bertolt Brecht|Brecht]], [[Heinrich Heine|Heine]], and [[Arno Schmidt|Schmidt]]. Nine Germans have won the [[Nobel Prize in literature]]: [[Theodor Mommsen]], [[Paul von Heyse]], [[Gerhart Hauptmann]], [[Thomas Mann]], [[Nelly Sachs]], [[Hermann Hesse]], [[Heinrich Böll]], [[Günter Grass]], and [[Herta Müller]].

===Philosophy===
{{Main|German philosophy}}

Germany's influence on philosophy is historically significant and many notable German philosophers have helped shape [[Western philosophy]] since the Middle Ages. The rise of the modern natural sciences and the related decline of religion raised a series of questions, which recur throughout German philosophy, concerning the relationships between knowledge and faith, reason and emotion, and scientific, ethical, and artistic ways of seeing the world.
[[File:Immanuel Kant (painted portrait).jpg|thumb|upright|German philosopher [[Immanuel Kant]]]]

[[List of German-language philosophers|German philosophers]] have helped shape [[western philosophy]] from as early as the Middle Ages ([[Albertus Magnus]]). Later, [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]] (17th century) and most importantly [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] played central roles in the [[history of philosophy]]. [[Kantianism]] inspired the work of [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]] and [[Nietzsche]] as well as [[German idealism]] defended by [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte|Fichte]] and [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]]. [[Friedrich Engels|Engels]] helped develop [[communist theory]] in the second half of the 19th century while [[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger]] and [[Hans-Georg Gadamer|Gadamer]] pursued the tradition of German philosophy in the 20th century. A number of German intellectuals were also influential in [[sociology]], most notably [[Theodor Adorno|Adorno]], [[Jürgen Habermas|Habermas]], [[Max Horkheimer|Horkheimer]], [[Niklas Luhmann|Luhmann]], [[Georg Simmel|Simmel]], [[Ferdinand Tönnies|Tönnies]], and [[Max Weber|Weber]]. The [[Humboldt University of Berlin|University of Berlin]] founded in 1810 by linguist and philosopher [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]] served as an influential model for a number of modern western universities.

In the 21st century, Germany has been an important country for the development of contemporary [[analytic philosophy]] in continental Europe, along with France, Austria, Switzerland and the Scandinavian countries.<ref>Searle, John.

===Cinema===
{{Main|Cinema of Germany}}
[[File:Diane Kruger at 2008 Venice Film Festival-01.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Diane Krüger]], 2008]]

German cinema dates back to the very early years of the medium with the work of [[Max Skladanowsky]]. It was particularly influential during the years of the [[Weimar Republic]] with [[German expressionism|German expressionists]] such as [[Robert Wiene]] and [[Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau]]. The [[Nazi era]] produced mostly propaganda films although the work of [[Leni Riefenstahl]] still introduced new aesthetics in film. From the 1960s, [[New German Cinema]] directors such as [[Volker Schlöndorff]], [[Werner Herzog]], [[Wim Wenders]], [[Rainer Werner Fassbinder]] placed [[West Germany|West-German]] cinema back onto the international stage with their often provocative films, while the [[DEFA (film studio)|DEFA]] film studio controlled film production in the [[East Germany|GDR]].

More recently, films such as ''[[Das Boot]]'' (1981), ''[[The NeverEnding Story (film)|The Never Ending Story]]'' (1984) ''[[Run Lola Run]]'' (1998), ''[[Das Experiment]]'' (2001), ''[[Good Bye Lenin!]]'' (2003), ''[[Head-On (film)|Gegen die Wand (Head-on)]]'' (2004) and ''[[Der Untergang|Der Untergang (Downfall)]]'' (2004) have enjoyed international success. In 2002 the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film went to [[Caroline Link]]'s ''[[Nowhere in Africa]]'', and in 2007 to [[Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck]]'s ''[[The Lives of Others]]''. The [[Berlin International Film Festival]], held yearly since 1951, is one of the world's foremost film and cinema festivals.<ref>''[https://web.archive.org/web/20070109173533/http://www.fiapf.org/pdf/2006accreditedFestivalsDirectory.pdf 2006 FIAPF accredited Festivals Directory], International Federation of Film Producers Associations.

[[Architecture|Architectural]] contributions from Germany include the [[Carolingian architecture|Carolingian]] and [[Ottonian architecture|Ottonian styles]], important precursors of [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]].  The region then produced significant works in styles such as the [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]], [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]], and [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]].

The nation was particularly important in the early [[modern architecture|modern movement]] through the [[Deutscher Werkbund]] and the [[Bauhaus]] movement identified with [[Walter Gropius]].  The [[Nazi architecture|Nazis]] closed these movements and favoured a type of [[neo-classical architecture|neo-classicism]].  Since World War II, further important modern and post-modern structures have been built, particularly since the reunification of Berlin.

===Religion===
{{main|Religion in Germany}}
[[File:Martin Luther, 1529.jpg|upright|thumb|Portrait of [[Martin Luther]]]]

Roman Catholicism was the sole established religion in the Holy Roman Empire until the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] changed this drastically. In 1517, Martin Luther challenged the Catholic Church as he saw it as a corruption of Christian faith. Through this, he altered the course of European and world history and established Protestantism.<ref>Plass, Ewald M., ''What Luther Says: An Anthology'', St. Louis: Concordia Publishing House, 1959, 2:964.</ref> The [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618–1648) was one of the most destructive conflicts in European history. The war was fought primarily in what is now Germany, and at various points involved most of the countries of Europe. The war was fought largely as a religious conflict between Protestants and Catholics in the Holy Roman Empire.<ref>Schiller, Frederick, ''History of the Thirty Years' War'', p.1, Harper Publishing</ref>

According to [[Census in Germany|the latest nationwide census]], Roman Catholics constituted 29.5% of the total population of Germany, followed by the Evangelical Protestants at 27.9%. Other Christian denominations, other religions, atheists or not specified constituted 42.6% of the population at the time. Among "others" are Protestants not included in [[Evangelical Church of Germany]], and other Christians such as the [[Restorationist]] [[New Apostolic Church]]. Protestantism was more common among the citizens of Germany.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://ergebnisse.zensus2011.de/auswertungsdb/download?pdf=00&tableId=0&locale=DE&gmdblt=1 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-08-24 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170525033109/https://ergebnisse.zensus2011.de/auswertungsdb/download?pdf=00&tableId=0&locale=DE&gmdblt=1 |archivedate=25 May 2017}}</ref> The North and East Germany is predominantly Protestant, the South and West rather Catholic.

Historically, Germany had a substantial [[History of the Jews in Germany|Jewish minority]]. Only a few thousand people of Jewish origin remained in Germany after [[the Holocaust]], but the German Jewish community now has approximately 100,000 members, many from the former [[Soviet Union]]. Germany also has a substantial Muslim minority, most of whom are immigrants from [[Turkey]].

German theologians include [[Martin Luther|Luther]], [[Philipp Melanchthon|Melanchthon]], [[Friedrich Schleiermacher|Schleiermacher]], [[Ludwig Andreas Feuerbach|Feuerbach]], and [[Rudolf Otto]]. Also Germany brought up many [[mysticism|mystics]] including [[Meister Eckhart]], [[Rudolf Steiner]], [[Jakob Boehme]], and some popes (e.g. [[Benedict XVI]]).

During the last decade of the 20th century, Germany changed its attitude towards immigrants. Until the mid-1990s the opinion was widespread that Germany is not a country of immigration, even though about 20% of the population were of non-German origin. Today the government and a majority of the German society are acknowledging that immigrants from diverse ethnocultural backgrounds are part of the German society and that controlled immigration should be initiated based on qualification standards.<ref>{{Cite book | first = Friedrich | last = Heckmann | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=l9yTtCAnQWwC&q=cdu+immigrant+einwanderungsland&pg=PA53 | title = The Integration of Immigrants in European Societies: national differences and trends of convergence| publisher=Lucius & Lucius | location = Stuttgart |pages=51ff | year = 2003 | isbn = 978-3-8282-0181-1 | accessdate =28 October 2010 }}</ref>

The event of the [[Protestant Reformation]] and the politics that ensued has been cited as the origins of German identity that arose in response to the spread of a common German language and literature.{{sfn|Motyl|2001|pp=189}} Early German national culture was developed through literary and religious figures including [[Martin Luther]], [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]] and [[Friedrich Schiller]].{{sfn|Kesselman|2009|pp=180}} The concept of a German nation was developed by German philosopher [[Johann Gottfried Herder]].{{sfn|Motyl|2001|pp=189–190}} The popularity of German identity arose in the aftermath of the [[French Revolution]].<ref name="Jeffrey E.

Persons who speak German as their first language, look German and whose families have lived in Germany for generations are considered "most German", followed by categories of diminishing Germanness such as [[Aussiedler]] (people of German ancestry whose families have lived in Eastern Europe but who have returned to Germany), Restdeutsche (people living in lands that have historically belonged to Germany but which is currently outside of Germany), Auswanderer (people whose families have emigrated from Germany and who still speak German), German speakers in German-speaking nations such as [[Austrians]], and finally people of German emigrant background who no longer speak German.<ref>Forsythe, Diana. 1989. German identity and the problem of history. ''History and ethnicity'', p.146</ref>

Pan-Germanism's origins began in the early 19th century following the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. The wars launched a new movement that was born in France itself during the French Revolution. Nationalism during the 19th century threatened the old aristocratic regimes. Many ethnic groups of Central and Eastern Europe had been divided for centuries, ruled over by the old Monarchies of the [[Romanovs]] and the [[Habsburgs]]. Germans, for the most part, had been a loose and disunited people since the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] when the [[Holy Roman Empire]] was shattered into a patchwork of states. The new German nationalists, mostly young reformers such as Johann Tillmann of [[East Prussia]], sought to unite all the German-speaking and ethnic-German (Volksdeutsche) people.

{{Further|Unification of Germany}}
[[File:Austria Hungary ethnic.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.15|An ethno-linguistic map of Austria–Hungary, 1910]]
By the 1860s the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] and the [[Austrian Empire]] were the two most powerful nations dominated by German-speaking elites. Both sought to expand their influence and territory. The Austrian Empire – like the [[Holy Roman Empire]] – was a multi-ethnic state, but German-speaking people there did not have an absolute numerical majority; the creation of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]] was one result of the growing nationalism of other ethnicities especially the [[Hungarians]] in Austrian territory. Prussia under [[Otto von Bismarck]] would eventually ride on the coat-tails of nationalism to unite all of modern-day Germany. Following several wars, most notably the [[Austro-Prussian war|German war]] in 1866 between Austria and Prussia, with the latter being victorious, the [[German Empire]] ("Second Reich") was created in 1871 as "Little Germany" without Austria following the proclamation of [[Wilhelm I]] as head of a union of German-speaking states, while disregarding millions of its non-German subjects who desired self-determination from German rule.

The creation of the multi-ethnic Austria-Hungary empire created strong ethnic conflict between the different ethnicities of the empire. [[German nationalism in Austria]] grew among all social circles of the empire, many wanted to be unified with the German Reich to form a [[Greater Germany]] and wanted policies to be carried out to enforce their German ethnic identity rejecting any Austrian pan-ethnic identity.<ref name="DPSO">{{cite web | url=http://www.politischebildung.at/upload/polsystem.pdf | title=Das politische System in Österreich (The Political System in Austria) | publisher=Austrian Federal Press Service | date=2000 | accessdate=9 July 2014 | page=24 | language=German | location=Vienna | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140423112116/http://www.politischebildung.at/upload/polsystem.pdf | archive-date=23 April 2014 | url-status=dead }}</ref> Many German Austrians felt annoyed that they were excluded from the German Empire since it included various non-German ethnic groups.<ref>{{Cite book |first=Kurt |last=Bauer |title=Nationalsozialismus: Ursprünge, Anfänge, Aufstieg und Fall |publisher=Böhlau Verlag |year=2008 |page=41 |language=German |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n9L1GyROMi0C&pg=PA41 |isbn=9783825230760 }}</ref> Prominent Austrian pan-Germans such as [[Georg Ritter von Schönerer]] created pan-German movements which demanded the annexation of all ethnic German territories.

Following the defeat in World War I, influence of German-speaking elites over [[Central Europe|Central]] and Eastern Europe was greatly limited. At the [[Treaty of Versailles]] Germany was substantially reduced in size. Austria-Hungary was split up. The German-speaking areas of Austria-Hungary were reduced to a rump state called the "[[Republic of German-Austria]]" (German: ''Deutschösterreich''). On 12 November, the National Assembly declared the rump state a republic and Social Democrat [[Karl Renner]] as provisional chancellor. On the same day, it drafted a provisional constitution which stated that "German-Austria is a democratic republic" (Article 1) and "German-Austria is an integral part of the German reich" (Article 2) with the hope of joining Germany.<ref>Alfred D.

During the 1920s, the constitutions of both the First Austrian Republic and the [[Weimar Republic]] included the goal of union between the two countries, which was supported by all different political parties. In the early 1930s, before the Nazis seized power, popularity for the addition of Austria to Germany remained strong and the Austrian government looked at the possibility of a [[customs union]] with Germany in 1931 but this was stopped by French opposition.<ref>William L. Patch, Heinrich Bruning and the Dissolution of the Weimar Republic, pp. 120, 166, 190</ref> In 1933, after Austrian-born Hitler came to power, support for an ''Anschluss'' grew. The [[Austrofascism]] era of [[Engelbert Dollfuss|Dollfuss]]/[[Kurt Schuschnigg|Schuschnigg]] between 1934 and 1938 accepted that Austrians were Germans and that Austria was a "German state" but was strongly opposed to Hitler's desire to annex Austria to the Third Reich and wished for Austria to remain independent.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Vsl6mwMXl4YC&pg=PA37|title=Constructing and Deconstructing National Identity: Dramatic Discourse in Tom Murphy's The Patriot Game and Felix Mitterer's in Der Löwengrube|first=Birgit|last=Ryschka|date=1 January 2008|publisher=Peter Lang|isbn=9783631581117}}</ref>

The ''[[Heim ins Reich]]'' initiative (German: literally ''Home into the Reich'', meaning ''Back to Reich'', see [[Reich]]) was a policy pursued by [[Nazi Germany]] which attempted to convince people of German descent living outside of Germany (such as [[Sudetenland]]) that they should strive to bring these regions "home" into a greater Germany, but also relocate from territories that were not under German control, following the conquest of Poland in accordance with the Nazi-Soviet pact. This policy began in 1938 on 12 March when Hitler annexed Austria to the Third Reich.

Germany suffered even larger territorial losses than it did in the First World War, with huge [[former eastern territories of Germany|portions of eastern Germany]] directly annexed by the Soviet Union<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QRINAQAAIAAJ&q=German+territorial+losses+to+soviet+union&pg=PA15|title=Communism in Eastern Europe|author=Teresa Rakowska-Harmstone|author-link=Teresa Rakowska-Harmstone|publisher=Manchester University Press ND|year=1984|pages=15–7|isbn=9780719017056}}</ref> and [[Poland]].<ref name=":1">{{Cite journal|last=Eberhardt|first=Piotr|year=2015|title=The Oder-Neisse Line as Poland's western border: As postulated and made a reality|url=https://www.geographiapolonica.pl/article/item/9928.html|journal=Geographia Polonica|volume=88|issue=1|pages=77–105|doi=10.7163/gpol.0007|doi-access=free}}</ref><ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last=Eberhardt|first=Piotr|year=2012|title=The Curzon line as the eastern boundary of Poland.

Nationalism and Pan-Germanism became almost taboo because they had been used so destructively by the Nazis. Indeed, the word "Volksdeutscher" in reference to ethnic Germans naturalized during WWII later developed into a mild epithet.

From the 1960s, Germany also saw increasing immigration, especially from Turkey, under an official programme aimed at encouraging "[[Gastarbeiter]]" or guestworkers to the country to provide labour during the post-war economic boom years. Although it had been expected that such workers would return home, many settled in Germany, with their descendants becoming German citizens.<ref name="Spiegel">[http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/at-home-in-a-foreign-country-german-turks-struggle-to-find-their-identity-a-795299.html At Home in a Foreign Country: German Turks Struggle to Find Their Identity], Spiegel Online.</ref>

{{Further|German reunification}}

However, [[German reunification]] in 1990 revived the old debates. The fear of nationalistic misuse of Pan-Germanism nevertheless remains strong. But the overwhelming majority of Germans today are not chauvinistic in nationalism, but in 2006 and again in 2010, the [[German National Football Team]] won third place in the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006]] and [[2010 FIFA World Cup]]s, ignited a positive scene of German pride, enhanced by success in sport.

For decades after the Second World War, any national symbol or expression was a taboo.<ref name="Proud German">{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/541844|title=Proud German? | work=The Economist | date=24 March 2001}}</ref> However, the Germans are becoming increasingly patriotic.<ref name="Proud German"/><ref name="generationaldynamics.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.generationaldynamics.com/cgi-bin/D.PL?xct=gd.e060623 |title=Are Germans now proud to be the Germans? |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130129212013/http://www.generationaldynamics.com/cgi-bin/D.PL?xct=gd.e060623 |archivedate=29 January 2013}}</ref> During a study in 2009, in which some 2,000 German citizens age 14 and upwards filled out a questionnaire, nearly 60% of those surveyed agreed with the sentiment "I'm proud to be German." And 78%, if free to choose their nation, would opt for German nationality with "near or absolute certainty".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.presseurop.eu/en/content/article/757-where-germans-dare |title=National Identity – Where Germans dare |publisher=Presseurop.eu |date=15 May 2009 |accessdate=2013-01-07}}</ref> Another study in 2009, carried out by the Identity Foundation in Düsseldorf, showed that 73% of the Germans were proud of their country, twice more than 8 years earlier. According to Eugen Buss, a sociology professor at the University of Hohenheim, there's an ongoing normalisation and more and more Germans are becoming openly proud of their country.<ref name="generationaldynamics.com"/>

In the midst of the [[European sovereign-debt crisis]], [[Radek Sikorski]], Poland's Foreign Minister, stated in November 2011, "I will probably be the first Polish foreign minister in history to say so, but here it is: I fear German power less than I am beginning to fear German inactivity. You have become Europe's indispensable nation."<ref name=Heilbrunn>{{cite journal|last=Heilbrunn|first=Jacob|title=All Roads Lead to Berlin|journal=The National Interest|date=November–December 2012|volume=Number 122|pages=41–47|url=http://nationalinterest.org/article/all-roads-lead-berlin-7622|accessdate=25 October 2012}}</ref> According to Jacob Heilbrunn, a senior editor at [[The National Interest]], such a statement is unprecedented when taking into consideration Germany's history. "This was an extraordinary statement from a top official of a nation that was ravaged by Germany during World War II. And it reflects a profound shift taking place throughout Germany and Europe about Berlin's position at the center of the Continent."<ref name="Heilbrunn"/> Heilbrunn believes that the adage, "what was good for Germany was bad for the European Union" has been supplanted by a new mentality—what is in the interest of Germany is also in the interest of its neighbors. The evolution in Germany's national identity stems from focusing less on its [[Nazi]] past and more on its Prussian history, which many Germans believe was betrayed—and not represented—by [[Nazism]].<ref name="Heilbrunn"/> The evolution is further precipitated by Germany's conspicuous position as Europe's strongest economy. Indeed, this German sphere of influence has been welcomed by the countries that border it, as demonstrated by Polish foreign minister [[Radek Sikorski]]'s effusive praise for his country's western neighbor.<ref name="Heilbrunn"/> This shift in thinking is boosted by a newer generation of Germans who see World War II as a distant memory.
