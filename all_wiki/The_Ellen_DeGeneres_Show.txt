==Concept==
The program combines comedy, celebrity, musical guests, and human-interest stories. The program often features audience participation games where prizes are awarded. During her Twelve Days of Giveaways promotion, audience members receive roughly $3,000 worth of prizes on each of twelve episodes. Because the show has become so popular, not all who arrive hoping to see a taping can fit into the studio, so an offshoot space, dubbed by [[Tom Hanks]] "The Riff Raff Room", was created. Persons seated here are often referenced and shown briefly on camera but watch the taping from off-stage. Other non-celebrities have been featured in an attempt by DeGeneres to give them [[15 minutes of fame]]. Guests in this role have included intelligent children, small business owners, etc. In the show's third season, DeGeneres began surprising fans by introducing them to their favorite celebrities.

===Recurring elements===
[[File:Ellen DeGeneres (2004).jpg|thumb|Ellen DeGeneres in 2004]]
Several recurring sounds, gags, and catchphrases are used by DeGeneres depending on the topic of discussion or theme for a specific episode. For example, after DeGeneres says the phrase, "Aww Snap!", a sound effect of a whip cracking often is played. In her monologue, DeGeneres frequently thanks the audience's applause by saying "I feel the same way about you!" Other video segments include DeGeneres scaring people, playing pranks, taking part in faux-breaking news segments, interacting with crew members, etc. Other recurring segments include those where DeGeneres comments on Internet videos, tabloid-style photographs of celebrities, advertisements on [[Craigslist]], or voicemails left for her on an answering machine. Some segments feature audience members more prominently, including having audience members show hidden talents, pictures of others that resemble DeGeneres, interviewing children, etc.

DeGeneres frequently plays games with audience members and awards prizes based upon their performance. Games have included ''[[Pictionary]]''-style drawing games, finding hidden objects within the studio, category, current event or pop-culture-based trivia, and various other stunt and charade-based games. DeGeneres also joked several times on the show about when a sequel to ''[[Finding Nemo]]'', in which she famously had a lead role, would eventually release, as well as make references to the film. Eventually, the sequel, ''[[Finding Dory]]'', was officially announced by DeGeneres.

On occasion they fail to scare the intended target, usually prompting a wisecrack from Ellen (examples include Russell Crowe, Colin Farrell, Daniel Radcliffe, and Garth Brooks).

''Heads Up!'' is a game that DeGeneres plays with other celebrities.

The app became a huge success after its May 2013 launch, rising to the top of the App Store with over 650,000 downloads during its first month. By July 2016, it had been downloaded more than 25 million times and remained one of Apple's top-paid apps.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/natalierobehmed/2016/07/14/heads-up-up-and-away-how-ellen-degeneres-game-became-a-hit/#522ac87429cb|title=Heads Up, Up and Away: How Ellen DeGeneres' Game Became A Hit|last=Robehmed|first=Natalie|work=Forbes|access-date=2017-07-25}}</ref>

====Dancing====
[[File:Obama-DeGeneres-dance-20120201.jpg|thumb|[[Michelle Obama]] and Ellen dance on the second anniversary of ''[[Let's Move!]]'']]
Since the show's debut, DeGeneres has segued from her opening monologue by doing a dance. The dancing proved to be extremely popular with viewers, and has since progressed to a segment where DeGeneres dances into the audience, sometimes borrowing a coat or purse from someone's chair, and taking it with her. She has also featured a segment in which people teach her new dance moves.

One of her most famous dance moves is dancing over the table, where she straddles the coffee table and dances from one end to the other. Although she does not do it every day, dancing over the table is a recurring theme. As an [[April Fools' Day]] prank in 2009, the show's staff placed a wider table top over her normal table. During the show, when DeGeneres attempted to dance over it, she barely made it across, being forced on her tip-toes and using the table as leverage. On the seventh-season premiere, DeGeneres performed a dance segment with the cast of ''[[So You Think You Can Dance (U.S. TV series)|So You Think You Can Dance]]''.

In September 2009, four major record labels sued the producers of the show for unspecified damages over the dance routine, for allegedly using songs without permission.<ref>{{cite news|last=Dobuzinskis|first=Alex|title=Record labels sue over use of songs on "Ellen" show|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2009/09/11/us-ellen-idUSTRE58A0LL20090911|access-date=October 17, 2013|newspaper=[[Reuters]]|date=September 11, 2009|location=Los Angeles}}</ref>

In 2018 ''[[The New York Times]]'' profiled DeGeneres as she faced decisions of renewing her talkshow contract, and exploring other outlets for her creativity including her [[Netflix]] comedy special ''Relatable''(2018), which spoofs her kind image.<ref name=":34">{{Cite news|last=Zinoman|first=Jason|date=2018-12-12|title=Ellen DeGeneres Is Not as Nice as You Think (Published 2018)|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/12/arts/television/ellen-degeneres.html|access-date=2020-10-17|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> They noted she felt boxed in with a reputation of always being nice, and the host who danced all time.<ref name=":34" /> DeGeneres—who acknowledges she hass always been over-sensitive—fretted how her audience would react when she no longer wanted to dance.<ref name=":34" /> Her [[Christian Science|Christian Scientist]] upbringing included her father’s [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]], “He was a very fearful man, he couldn’t hear or engage with anything unpleasant.”<ref name=":34" />

Margaret Smith left the show to work on her own projects, including her first book, ''What Was I Thinking? How Being a Stand Up Did Nothing to Prepare Me to Become a Single Mother'' (Crossroad Publishing, 2008). Amy Rhodes, a former writer for the program, regularly appeared on camera during various segments.

====DJ====
Unlike most talk shows, the show uses a [[disc jockey]] to supply music rather than a band. Originally, the role was filled by Los Angeles-based DJ Scott K, who lasted only a few weeks. He was later replaced by [[Tony Okungbowa]], who DJed through season 3. Due to his growing acting career, Okungbowa left the show, and a few guest DJs were brought in to try out for the position. Tony was replaced by actor/DJ [[Jon Abrahams]] for the fourth-season premiere. Abrahams stayed on the show for one season, and also left as his acting career grew. [[Stryker (DJ)|Ted Stryker]] of [[KROQ-FM|KROQ]], was the DJ for the fifth season. Stryker stayed for one season until Okungbowa returned. In a 2012 episode, DJ [[Pauly D]] from ''[[Jersey Shore (TV series)|Jersey Shore]]'' deejayed when Okungbowa was promoting his CD.

Starting in season 11, several episodes include celebrity "guest DJs" filling the DJ position in Okungbowa's absence. The most frequently appearing guest DJ is [[Stephen "tWitch" Boss]] of ''[[So You Think You Can Dance]]'' fame.

Okungbowa made a return appearance on the show in the April 28, 2014 episode, while Loni made a return in the June 5, 2015 episode.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

===2007 Writers Guild strike===
DeGeneres, a member of the [[Writers Guild of America]], supported the [[2007–08 Writers Guild of America strike|2007 writers' strike]].<ref name="Television: Tears, strike">{{cite web |last=Justin |first=Neal |title=Television: Tears, strike aside, DeGeneres shows go on |publisher=Minneapolis St. Paul Star Tribune |date=November 16, 2007 |url=http://www.startribune.com/entertainment/tv/11828236.html |access-date=December 16, 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071221064005/http://www.startribune.com/entertainment/tv/11828236.html |archive-date=December 21, 2007 }}</ref> However, on November 9, 2007, DeGeneres crossed the picket line to tape more episodes of her TV show stating: {{cquote|It was explained to me that no other daytime shows have shut down. I've got 135 employees that rely on me for a paycheck. But it's been the hardest thing in the world driving onto this lot.<ref name="Television: Tears, strike"/>}}

DeGeneres decided to abstain from doing a monologue on her show (which is typically written by WGA writers) during the strike.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ellen DeGeneres Speaks Only In Exotic Birdcalls As A Gesture Of Writer Solidarity|url=http://defamer.com/hollywood/hollywood-strikewatch/ellen-degeneres-speaks-only-in-exotic-birdcalls-as-a-gesture-of-writer-solidarity-321145.php|date=November 9, 2007|publisher=[[Gawker Media|Defamer]]|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://archive.today/20121006192753/http://gawker.com/321145/ellen-degeneres-speaks-only-in-exotic-birdcalls-as-a-gesture-of-writer-solidarity|archive-date=6 October 2012|access-date=December 2, 2007}}</ref> Her show continued production as normal with the exception of her monologue being omitted. The WGAE issued a statement condemning DeGeneres, stating she was "not welcome in NY."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.deadlinehollywooddaily.com/wga-east-says-ellen-not-welcome-in-ny/ |title=WGAE States Ellen "Not Welcome In NY" |access-date=December 2, 2007 |publisher=Deadline Hollywood Daily |first=Nikki |last=Finke |date=November 9, 2007 |author-link=Nikki Finke}}</ref> DeGeneres's representatives asserted that she did not violate the WGA's agreement, arguing that she is competing with other first-run syndicated shows like ''[[Dr. Phil (TV series)|Dr. Phil]]'' and ''[[Live with Kelly and Ryan|Live with Regis and Kelly]]'' during the competitive November [[Nielsen ratings#Sweeps|sweeps period]], and that DeGeneres must fulfill her duties as host and producer, lest her show lose its time slot or be held in breach of contract. In addition, a statement defending DeGeneres was subsequently issued by [[American Federation of Television and Radio Artists|AFTRA]], pointing out that DeGeneres also works under the AFTRA TV Code, which bars her from striking. The [[Writers Guild of America, East|WGAE]] then issued a response pointing out that DeGeneres is also a Writers Guild member, and that any writing work she did on her show during the strike constituted [[Strikebreaker|struck work]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.deadlinehollywooddaily.com/advisory-i-have-ellens-response/ |title=UrgentT!

===COVID-19 pandemic===

It was announced that starting March 16, 2020, that the taping of ''The Ellen DeGeneres Show'' would be without an audience. Since April 6, 2020, the show has been produced from her home.

On April 16, 2020, ''Variety'' reported that crew members had accused the show of not communicating about their pay during the pandemic-induced shutdown.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Donnelly|first=Matt|date=2020-04-17|title='Ellen' Crew Furious Over Poor Communication Regarding Pay, Non-Union Workers During Coronavirus Shutdown (EXCLUSIVE)|url=https://variety.com/2020/tv/news/ellen-crew-furious-over-poor-communication-regarding-pay-non-union-workers-during-coronavirus-shutdown-exclusive-1234582735/|access-date=2020-07-28|website=Variety|language=en}}</ref>

=== Work culture ===
In 2018 ''[[The New York Times]]'' profiled Degeneres as she faced decisions of renewing her talkshow contract, and exploring other outlets for her creativity including her [[Netflix]] comedy special ''Relatable'' (2018), which spoofs her kind image.<ref name=":34"/> When asked about anonymous [[Tabloid journalism|tabloid]] reports that she is not always nice to her workers, she thought the accusations were false, “The one thing I want is for everyone to be happy and proud of where they work, and if not, don’t work here.”<ref name=":34" />

In July 2020, ''[[BuzzFeed News]]'' ran articles in which anonymous former employees accused the show of being a [[toxic workplace]], accused the executive producers of [[Sexual harassment|harassment]], as well as alleging an atmosphere with racist comments and [[Microaggression|microaggressions]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Yandoli|first=Krystie Lee|date=July 16, 2020|title=Former Employees Say Ellen's "Be Kind" Talk Show Mantra Masks A Toxic Work Culture|url=https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/krystieyandoli/ellen-employees-allege-toxic-workplace-culture|access-date=July 17, 2020|work=BuzzFeed News}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Yandoli|first1=Krystie Lee|date=July 30, 2020|title=Dozens Of Former "Ellen Show" Employees Say Executive Producers Engaged In Rampant Sexual Misconduct And Harassment|url=https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/krystieyandoli/ex-ellen-show-employees-sexual-misconduct-allegations|access-date=July 31, 2020|publisher=BuzzFeed News}}</ref> [[WarnerMedia]] began an investigation.<ref>{{cite web|last=Donnelly|first=Matt|date=July 27, 2020|title='Ellen DeGeneres Show' Workplace Under Investigation by WarnerMedia (EXCLUSIVE)|url=https://variety.com/2020/tv/news/ellen-degeneres-workplace-investigation-1234717494/|access-date=July 27, 2020|work=Variety}}</ref> DeGeneres apologized to her staff, writing that “she intended for her show to be a place where ‘no one would ever raise their voice, and everyone would be treated with respect’ and that she was ‘disappointed to learn that this has not been the case.’”<ref>{{cite web|last1=Stone|first1=Natalie|date=July 30, 2020|title=Ellen DeGeneres Apologizes to Talk Show Staff in Letter Addressing Workplace Complaints|url=https://people.com/tv/ellen-degeneres-apologizes-talk-show-staff-letter-addressing-workplace-complaints/|access-date=July 31, 2020|publisher=People}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|last=Yahr|first=Emily|title=Ellen DeGeneres returns to TV, addresses controversy: 'Being known as the "be kind" lady is a tricky position to be in'|language=en-US|work=Washington Post|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/arts-entertainment/2020/09/21/ellen-degeneres-addresses-show-controversy/|access-date=2020-10-17|issn=0190-8286}}</ref> Following the investigation, three executives were fired, executive producers Ed Glavin and Kevin Leman, and co-executive producer Jonathan Norman.<ref>{{cite news |title=Ellen DeGeneres: Three producers fired over 'toxic workplace' claims |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-53815705 |work=BBC |date=August 18, 2020}}</ref> The show vowed to take steps to change the culture; DeGeneres apologized again during the eighteenth season’s September 2020 opening.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Tracer|first=Daniel|date=2020-09-21|title=WATCH: Ellen addresses the elephant in the room in season 18 premiere|url=https://www.queerty.com/watch-ellen-addresses-elephant-room-season-18-premiere-20200921|access-date=2020-09-22|website=Queerty}}</ref> Her DJ, [[Stephen "tWitch" Boss]], was promoted to co-executive producer and has served as host for the show filling in for DeGeneres.

==Episodes==
{{Main|List of The Ellen DeGeneres Show episodes}}

===Special episodes===
Several episodes have aired with a special theme or format, including a "Backwards Show", entire episodes themed around Broadway productions, a Thanksgiving special taped in the [[Ed Sullivan Theater]] in New York City, an entire episode which included [[Deltalina]] filmed on a [[Delta Air Lines|Delta]] airplane, her 12 Days of Giveaways shows and Ellen's Birthday Show. Other recurring themes feature products from sponsors DeGeneres likes (similar to [[Oprah's Favorite Things]] from the now ended ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]''), specials following awards show telecasts (such as the [[Academy Awards]]), and numerous milestone episodes (e.g., DeGeneres's 1,000th, 1,300th, 1,500th, etc. broadcasts). In 2017, an episode aired commemorating the 20th anniversary of "[[The Puppy Episode]]," the episode of her sitcom ''[[Ellen (TV series)|Ellen]]'', in which her character Ellen Morgan came out as a [[lesbian]].

The episode titled "Sirdeaner Walker Interview" was nominated for a [[GLAAD Media Award]] for "Outstanding Talk Show Episode" during the [[21st GLAAD Media Awards]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=21st Annual GLAAD Media Awards&nbsp;– English Language Nominees|url=http://www.glaad.org/mediaawards/21/nominees|year=2010|publisher=[[GLAAD|Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation]]|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100117085103/http://www.glaad.org/mediaawards/21/nominees|archive-date=17 January 2010|access-date=February 21, 2010}}</ref>

On January 11, 2013, DeGeneres announced that she was going to [[Australia]] in March with her wife, Australian actress [[Portia de Rossi]], after having wanted to go for many years, being unable to visit in summer (which she preferred) due to taping conflicts of her show.<ref>{{cite web|title=First Oprah.

On March 3, 2014, DeGeneres hosted the show live, one day after her being the host of the [[86th Academy Awards]]. This episode features that year's Oscar winners [[Cate Blanchett]], [[Jared Leto]], and [[Lupita Nyong'o]] as guests.
