'''Vice News''' (stylized as '''VICE News''') is [[Vice Media]]'s current affairs channel, producing daily documentary essays and [[documentary film|video]] through its website and [[YouTube]] channel. It promotes itself on its coverage of "under-reported stories".<ref>{{cite web | url=https://news.vice.com/about | title=About Us | publisher=Vice News | access-date=2014-07-11 |url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140703231911/https://news.vice.com/about | archive-date=2014-07-03 }}</ref> Vice News was created in December 2013 and is based in [[New York City]], though it has bureaus worldwide.

== History ==
Before Vice News was founded, ''[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]'' published news documentaries and news reports from around the world through its [[YouTube]] channel alongside other programs. ''Vice'' had reported on events such as [[crime in Venezuela]], the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]], [[Gezi Park protests|protests in Turkey]], the [[North Korea]]n regime, and the [[Syrian Civil War]] through their own YouTube channel and website. After the creation of Vice News as a separate division, its reporting greatly increased with worldwide coverage starting immediately with videos published on YouTube and articles on its website daily.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://adage.com/article/the-media-guy/vice-news-srsly/291968/|title=Vice News Is Seriously Very Serious (SRSLY)|last=Dumenco|first=Simon|date=March 4, 2014|website=[[Advertising Age]]|access-date=2016-08-01}}</ref>

December 2013, Vice Media expanded its international news division into an independent division dedicated to news exclusively and created Vice News. Vice Media put $50 million into its news division, setting up 34 [[News bureau|bureaus]] worldwide and drawing praise for its in-depth coverage of international news.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffbercovici/2014/03/04/vice-news-launches-promising-changing-of-the-guard-in-media/|title=Vice News Launches, Promising 'Changing Of The Guard In Media'|last=Bercovici|first=Jeff|date=March 4, 2014|website=Forbes|access-date=2016-08-01}}</ref> Vice News has primarily targeted a younger audience comprised predominantly of [[millennials]], the same audience to which its parent company appeals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/blogs/media/2014/02/vice-news-where-video-works-184058.html|title=Vice News, where video works|last=Byers|first=Dylan|date=February 26, 2014|website=[[Politico]]|access-date=2016-08-01}}</ref>

In November 2014, Vice News launched its French-language version.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/10/17/vice-news-expansion-global_n_6002932.html|title=Vice News To Expand Globally|last=Mosbergen|first=Dominique|date=October 17, 2014|website=[[The Huffington Post]]|access-date=2016-08-01}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/oct/17/vice-media-youtube-news-channel-new-york-local-language-launch|title=Vice Media expands news channel to seven new countries|last=Sweney|first=Mark|date=October 17, 2014|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=2016-08-01}}</ref>

In October 2015 Vice hired [[Josh Tyrangiel]] to run a daily Vice News show for [[HBO]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=Jarvey|first=Natalie|date=14 October 2015|title=Vice Taps Former Bloomberg Businessweek Editor to Run Daily HBO Show|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/vice-hbo-show-taps-bloomberg-832119|access-date=2020-11-10|website=Hollywood Reporter}}</ref> Tyrangiel had recently left ''[[Bloomberg Businessweek]]'', where he was reported to be "a divisive figure who was both admired and despised during his six years there."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/10/02/why-bloomberg-s-top-editor-quit-and-why-it-shows-mike-bloomberg-is-back-in-charge.html|title=Why Bloomberg's Top Editor Quit—and Why It Shows Mike Bloomberg Is Back in Charge|last=Grove|first=Lloyd|date=October 2, 2015|website=[[The Daily Beast]]|access-date=2016-08-01}}</ref> Tyrangiel named Ryan McCarthy, formerly an assistant editor of ''[[The New York Times]]'', as editor-in-chief of Vice News.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.politico.com/media/story/2016/04/vice-news-names-ryan-mccarthy-editor-in-chief-004485|title=Vice News names Ryan McCarthy editor in chief|last=Sterne|first=Peter|date=April 18, 2016|work=Politico|access-date=2018-02-13}}</ref>

In May 2016, it was announced that Tyrangiel had also been given control of the weekly Vice on HBO show as well as Vice News. As the announcement was made, Tyrangiel promptly laid off much of the news staff.<ref name="Quinn&Jackson" /> In an interview given the previous week, Vice Media founder [[Shane Smith (journalist)|Shane Smith]] called Tyrangiel "a murderer," foretelling a "bloodbath" in digital media.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://digiday.com/publishers/shane-smith-vice-media-interview/|title=Vice's Shane Smith: 'Expect a bloodbath' in media within the next year |last=Valinsky|first=Jordan|date=May 20, 2016|magazine=[[Digiday]]|access-date=2016-08-01}}</ref>

On May 24, 2016, a change in leadership at Vice News resulted in the laying off of some 20 editorial and production staff members.<ref name="Quinn&Jackson">{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/may/24/vice-media-lays-off-20-staff-in-restructuring-plans|title=Vice Media lays off 20 staff in restructuring plans|last=Quinn|first=Ben|date=May 24, 2016|last2=Jackson|first2=Jasper|newspaper=The Guardian|access-date=2016-08-01}}</ref> That June, Tyrangiel touted various new hires he had brought aboard as part of his team.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://variety.com/2016/digital/news/vice-news-new-hires-josh-tyrangiel-1201786571/|title=Vice News Touts New Hires in Staff Reshuffle Under Josh Tyrangiel|last=Spangler|first=Todd|date=June 1, 2016|website=Variety|access-date=2016-08-01}}</ref>

In December 2016, it was announced that Vice News had entered into a partnership with ''[[The Guardian]]'' newspaper that will include ''Guardian'' journalists working at Vice's offices in [[East London]] and contributing to the two HBO television programs currently on the air. It will also include allowing ''The Guardian'' access to Vice's video production skills with content distributed to its millennial-skewed global audience.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/dec/08/guardian-announces-partnership-with-vice |title=Guardian announces partnership with Vice |last=Sweney |first=Mark |date=December 8, 2016 |newspaper=The Guardian |access-date=December 8, 2016}}</ref>

== Reception ==
The Vice News YouTube page has 5.6 million subscribers as well as more than 1.6 billion views in total.<ref>{{cite web|title=VICE News|url=https://www.youtube.com/c/VICENews/about|access-date=November 6, 2019|via=YouTube}}</ref> and in August 2014, was described by ''The Guardian'' as one of the fastest growing channels on YouTube.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/aug/23/vice-news-younger-viewers-bbc-channel-4-youtube-social-media|title=Vice News sparks debate on engaging younger viewers|last=Sweney|first=Mark|date=August 23, 2014|newspaper=The Guardian|access-date=2016-08-01}}</ref>

Lara Pendergast, deputy online editor at the UK magazine ''[[The Spectator]]'' argues that Vice News gets its strength and popularity by getting younger audiences to become more and more interested about international news in a way that traditional media has not. "Its videos may fail every rule in the [[BBC]] impartiality book, but they are brilliantly edited and, often, utterly compelling. Vice News has found young, fearless foreign correspondents to serve a youthful audience who are bored stiff by traditional outlets but are quite prepared to watch videos on their mobile phones."

"Vice's brand image marketing as an edgy, hip outlet have helped drive its popularity with young people", says media critic Charles Johnson. "Mainstream media is not trusted by a lot of people, and rightly so, so they [Vice] step in and fill in", he says. "People see a sense of fun behind it. [[Jon Stewart]] is very popular, but he's an entertainer. Vice is something similar."<ref name="globaljournalist">{{Cite web|url=http://globaljournalist.org/2014/09/despite-controversies-vice-news-thrives-young-audience/|title=Vice News thrives with young audience, controversy |last=Goldner|first=Tracey|date=September 25, 2014|website=Global Journalist|access-date=2016-08-01}}</ref>

Rick Edmonds, media and business analyst at the [[Poynter Institute]], critiques Vice News' reporting as "raw and tasteless sometimes" and more akin to personal essays than balanced journalism. Other critiques mention that its work is more affiliated with entertainment than hard-hitting news.<ref name="globaljournalist" />

In a 2013 opinion piece for ''[[U.S. News & World Report]]'', editor of the New York-based [[Foreign Policy Association]] Robert Nolan, stated that Vice's [[North Korea]] reporting was "more [[Jackass (franchise)|''Jackass'' TV series]] than journalism".<ref name="globaljournalist" /><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/mar/02/vice-media-shane-smith-north-korea|title=Vice's Shane Smith: 'Young people are angry and leaving TV in droves'|last=Swaine|first=Jon|date=March 2, 2014|newspaper=The Guardian|access-date=2016-08-01}}</ref>
