He was executive editor of ''[[The New York Times]]'' from 2001 until he left in 2003 in the wake of the scandal related to reporting by [[Jayson Blair]].

==Early life and career==
Raines was born in [[Birmingham, Alabama]]. He earned a bachelor's degree from [[Birmingham-Southern College]] in 1964 and a master's degree in English from the [[University of Alabama]] in 1973. In September 1964, Raines began his newspaper career as a reporter for the ''Birmingham Post-Herald'' in Alabama. He also reported for WBRC-TV in Birmingham.

After a year as a reporter at the ''Birmingham News'', in 1971 Raines was selected as political editor of the ''[[Atlanta Constitution]]''. In 1976 he left that post to become political editor at the ''[[St. Petersburg Times]]''.<ref>{{cite web |title=Reporting scandal drives out ''New York Times'' editors |first=Eric |last=Deggans |work=St. Petersburg Times |date=June 6, 2003 |url=http://www.sptimes.com/2003/06/06/Worldandnation/Reporting_scandal_dri.shtml}}</ref>

==''The New York Times''==
Raines joined ''The New York Times'' in 1978, as a national correspondent based in [[Atlanta]]. By 1979, Raines was promoted to Atlanta's bureau chief, a position he held until 1981, when he became a national political correspondent.

By the next year, Raines had advanced to become a [[White House]] correspondent for ''The Times''. He progressed to management in 1985, becoming deputy Washington editor. In 1987, Raines transferred to [[London]] and worked as the newspaper's London bureau chief. The next year, he returned to [[Washington D.C.]] to become the city's bureau chief.

In 1992, Raines published an essay, "Grady's Gift", about his childhood in Alabama. He fondly described the family's black housekeeper.<ref>{{cite news|date=December 1, 1991|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/12/01/magazine/grady-s-gift.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm |title=Grady's Gift |first=Howell |last=Raines |work=The New York Times}}</ref> His memoir was awarded the [[Pulitzer Prize for Feature Writing]].<ref>{{cite news |title='Thousand Acres' Wins Fiction as 21 Pulitzer Prizes Are Given |url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/98/04/05/specials/smiley-pulitzer.html?_r=1 | work=The New York Times}}</ref>

In 1993 Raines moved to New York City as the ''Times'' editorial page editor, a position he held for eight years. The aggressive, colloquial style of his editorials, especially those critical of President [[Bill Clinton]] and his administration, drew widespread notice and a share of criticism. His work marked a departure from the measured tone for which ''Times'' editorials had been known.<ref>{{cite web |title=Howlin' Howell |first=Edwin |last=Diamond |work=New York |date=August 30, 1993}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=The Howell Raines Question |first=Peter J. |last=Boyer |work=The New Yorker |date=August 22, 1994}}</ref>

Raines was appointed Executive Editor of ''The Times'' in September 2001, serving until May 2003. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.encyclopediaofalabama.org/article/h-1891|title=Howell Raines|website=Encyclopedia of Alabama|language=en|access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref> At that time, controversy generated by the reporting scandal related to [[Jayson Blair]] led to his dismissal. A ''Times'' internal investigation revealed that 36 of the 73 national stories Blair filed with the paper over a six-month period were marred by errors, false datelines or evidence of plagiarism. Raines was faulted for continuing to publish Blair months after the paper's metro editor, Jonathan Landman, sent him a memo urging him "to stop Jayson from writing for ''The Times''. Right now."<ref>{{cite web |title=Times To Go |work=American Journalism Review |date=June 2003 |url=http://www.ajr.org/article.asp?id=3049}}</ref>

The Blair inquiry also revealed widespread discontent among ''Times'' staffers over Raines' management style, which was described as arbitrary and heavy-handed. According to a New York Times article, the deputy metropolitan editor, Joe Sexton, was quoted as telling Raines and managing editor [[Gerald M. Boyd|Gerald Boyd]], at a closed meeting of employees, "I believe that at a deep level you guys have lost the confidence of many parts of the newsroom ... People feel less led than bullied."<ref>{{cite news |title=Editor of ''Times'' Tells Staff He Accepts Blame for Fraud |work=The New York Times |date=May 15, 2003 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/05/15/business/media/15PAPE.html?pagewanted=all |first=Jacques |last=Steinberg}}</ref> On another occasion Jerelle Kraus, art director for the newspaper's weekend section, was quoted as saying, "I hope things settle down and we get a decent executive editor who's reasonable. Howell Raines is someone who is feared."<ref name="resignations">{{cite news |title=''Times'' Executives Howell Raines and Gerald Boyd Resign |url=http://www.boston.com/news/daily/05/nytimes_resignation.htm | work=The Boston Globe}}</ref> Both Raines and Boyd resigned.<ref name="resignations"/>

The paper's owner, [[Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, Jr.]], also conducted an investigation and concluded that Raines had alienated most of the New York and Washington bureaus. Raines' resignation, along with that of Gerald Boyd, was announced in the June 5, 2003 issue of ''The Times''.<ref name="resignations"/>

[[Joseph Lelyveld]], who had been Executive Editor of ''The Times'' from 1994 to 2001, agreed to replace Raines on an interim basis. On July 14, 2003, it was announced that [[Bill Keller]] had been chosen as Raines' permanent replacement. In an interview on the Charlie Rose show of July 11, Raines admitted that Sulzberger had "asked [him] to step aside."<ref>{{cite news |title=Bill Keller, Columnist, Is Selected As ''The Times's'' Executive Editor |work=The New York Times |date=July 15, 2003 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/07/15/us/bill-keller-columnist-is-selected-as-the-times-s-executive-editor.html?ref=billkeller |first=Jacques |last=Steinberg}}</ref>

==Later activities==
Raines reviewed his tenure as Executive Editor of the ''New York Times'' in a 21,000-word piece published in the May 2004 issue of ''[[The Atlantic]]''.<ref>[https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2004/05/my-times/302952/], ''The Atlantic''</ref> In it he said that he was hired by Sulzberger in the shared conviction that ''The Times'' had grown complacent and no longer functioned as a meritocracy in the assignment of stories to reporters.

In the private meeting with reporters called by Sulzberger, in which the owner announced Keller's succession to Raines' old job, Sulzberger reportedly denied ever holding such a view. Raines stood by his account and implied that Sulzberger was retreating from the position which he said he and the owner shared at the time of his promotion.

<blockquote>In the only interview I have given on the Jayson Blair affair, I spoke on the Charlie Rose show of the resistance I had encountered as a 'change agent' who was handpicked by the publisher to confront the newsroom's lethargy and complacency. A few days later, as he introduced my successor, Bill Keller, to the assembled staff, Arthur [Ochs Sulzberger, Jr.] rebutted my comment by saying, 'There's no complacency here—never has been, never will be.' I can guarantee that no one in that newsroom, including Arthur himself, believed what he said ... Arthur's words signaled that nothing dramatic would be done to upset the paper's cosseted world.<ref>{{cite web |title=My Times |first=Howell |last=Raines |work=The Atlantic |date=May 2004 |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/past/docs/issues/2004/05/raines.htm}}</ref></blockquote>

Raines revisited the controversy in his 2006 book, ''The One That Got Away''. It combines fishing stories and a review of his career as a journalist and editor. He assessed the events preceding the Jayson Blair scandal and his own dismissal. On January 14, 2008, ''Condé Nast Portfolio'' announced that Raines would become its media columnist. His first column, published in the March issue, analyzed the possibility of [[Rupert Murdoch]] buying the ''New York Times'', which he said would have deeply adverse consequences.<ref>{{cite web |title=Murdoch vs. the Times |first=Howell |last=Raines |work=Portfolio |date=March 17, 2008 |url=http://www.portfolio.com/views/columns/2008/03/17/Howell-Raines-on-Rupert-Murdoch/}}</ref> Raines published an [[op-ed]] in the March 14, 2010 edition of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' that was highly critical of [[Fox News Channel]]. He suggested its biased reporting was not sufficiently criticized by legitimate media.<ref name="wapooutlook">{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/03/11/AR2010031102523.html |title=Why don't honest journalists take on Roger Ailes and Fox News? |last=Raines |first=Howell |date=March 14, 2010 |accessdate=March 16, 2010 |work=The Washington Post}}</ref>
