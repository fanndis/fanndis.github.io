As CEO of Walmart International, Cheesewright was a central figure Walmart Canada's wrongful dismissal of Gail Galea.  In January 2010, Cheesewright removed Galea from her position as Vice President, General Merchandising, but failed to assign her to a comparable position.  Several months later, Cheesewright terminated her employment with Walmart Canada.  The Ontario Superior Court of Justice found that Cheesewright made the decision to dismiss or denigrate Galea to the point where she would resign, and that his conduct was unfair and in bad faith.  Galea was awarded more than $1.6 million against Walmart Canada in compensatory, moral and punitive damages.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://canlii.ca/t/hp7lm|title=Galea v.
