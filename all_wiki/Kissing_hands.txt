To '''kiss hands''' is a constitutional term used in the United Kingdom to refer to the formal installation of [[The Crown|Crown]]-appointed British [[government minister]]s to their office.

==Overview==
In the past, it referred to the requirement that the office-holder actually [[kiss]] the hands of the [[monarch|Sovereign]] as a symbol of personal [[fealty]] and [[loyalty]] to the Sovereign, that fealty and loyalty being a requirement to serve in the King's or Queen's government.
 
In modern times, office-holders are not expected physically to kiss the hands of the Sovereign before assuming the role.  Simply being received by the Queen is taken to validate the selection, with this meeting being described in the [[Court Circular]] as "kissing hands". The invitation issued to a party leader to form a government is sometimes still described as "an invitation to kiss hands". The metaphorical kissing of hands (i.e. the appointment) does not legally take place until the subsequent meeting of the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]], when the new minister is formally appointed as a member of the Council.<ref>Alan Cowell, [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/27/world/europe/27cnd-queen.html ‘The Queen’ Got It Wrong: No Hands Are Kissed], ''New York Times'', 27 June 2007; the [https://web.archive.org/web/20100414023100/http://www.royal.gov.uk/MonarchUK/QueenandGovernment/QueenandPrimeMinister.aspx royal web page] mentioned in the article (part of the official website of the British Monarchy) was archived from [http://www.royal.gov.uk/MonarchUK/QueenandGovernment/QueenandPrimeMinister.aspx the original] at 14 April 2010.</ref>

When appointing a [[Secretary of State (United Kingdom)|Secretary of State]] (the top rank in the [[Her Majesty's Government|UK government]]), the protocol also involves the delivery by the Sovereign of the seals of office into the hands of the appointee. This is also valid for other officers who are keepers of seals, such as the [[Lord Privy Seal]] or the [[Lord Chancellor]], who is also keeper of the [[Great Seal of the Realm|Great Seal]] of the United Kingdom.

Ordinarily the ceremony will take place in [[Buckingham Palace]], but it has been known to happen in [[Windsor Castle]] or [[Balmoral Castle]]. More unusually, when [[H. H. Asquith]] took the premiership after the ailing [[Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman]]'s resignation in April 1908, [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|King Edward VII]] controversially summoned Asquith to [[Biarritz]], France, where he was on holiday at the time.
