The '''''Africa Yearbook''''' is an annual publication devoted to politics, economy and society south of the Sahara.

== Scope ==
The yearbook covers major domestic political developments, the foreign policy and socio-economic trends in sub-Sahara Africa – all related to developments in one calendar year. The Africa Yearbook contains articles on all sub-Saharan states, each of the four sub-regions (West, Central, Eastern, Southern Africa) focusing on major cross-border developments and sub-regional organizations as well as one article on continental developments and one on European-African relations.

While the articles have thorough academic quality, the Yearbook is mainly oriented to the requirements of a large range of target groups: students, politicians, diplomats, administrators, journalists, teachers, practitioners in the field of development aid as well as business people.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ascleiden.nl/Publications/AEGISYearbook.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-01-30 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100310095818/http://www.ascleiden.nl/Publications/AEGISYearbook.aspx |archivedate=2010-03-10 }} Retrieved 30 January 2010.</ref>
