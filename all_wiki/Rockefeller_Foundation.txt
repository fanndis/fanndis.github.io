==Beginnings==
[[File:Rflogo1.jpg|thumb|Original Rockefeller logo, no longer in use]]
Rockefeller's interest in philanthropy and [[Public Relations]] began in 1904, influenced by [[Ida Tarbell]]'s book published about Standard Oil crimes, ''[[The History of the Standard Oil Company]]'', which prompted him to whitewash the Rockefeller image.<ref>{{cite episode| url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/biography/rockefellers-tarbell/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190321020228/http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/rockefellers-tarbell/|archive-date=2019-03-21|title=The Rockefellers| station=[[WGBH-TV|WGBH]]| series=[[American Experience]]| network=[[PBS]]| air-date=October 16, 2000| access-date=2019-07-01}}</ref>{{failed verification|date=July 2019}}

His initial idea to set up a large-scale foundation occurred in 1901, but it was not until 1906 that Senior's famous business and philanthropic advisor, [[Frederick Taylor Gates]], seriously revived the idea, saying that Rockefeller's fortune was rolling up so fast his heirs would "dissipate their inheritances or become intoxicated with power", unless he set up "permanent corporate philanthropies for the good of Mankind".<ref name=Titan>{{cite book| quote=''As early as 1901, Rockefeller had realized he needed to create a foundation on a scale that dwarfed anything he had done so far...''| first=Ron| last=Chernow| title=Titan: The Life of John D. Rockefeller, Sr.| location=New York| publisher=Random House| date=May 5, 1998| pages=563–566| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Mleb5acWQF4C&q=foundation| isbn=978-0679438083}}</ref>

It was also in 1906 that the [[Russell Sage Foundation]] was established, though its program was limited to working women and social ills.  Rockefeller's would thus not be the first foundation in America ([[Benjamin Franklin]] was the first to introduce the concept), but it brought to it unprecedented international scale and scope. In 1909 he signed over 73,000 shares of [[Standard Oil]] of New Jersey, valued at $50 million, to the three inaugural trustees, Junior, Gates and [[Harold Fowler McCormick]], the first installment of a projected $100 million endowment.<ref name=Titan/>

They applied for a federal [[charter]] for the foundation in the [[United States Senate|US Senate]] in 1910, with at one stage Junior even secretly meeting with President [[William Howard Taft]], through the aegis of Senator [[Nelson Aldrich]], to hammer out concessions.{{citation needed|date=September 2009}} However, because of the ongoing (1911) antitrust suit against Standard Oil at the time, along with deep suspicion in some quarters of undue Rockefeller influence on the spending of the endowment, the end result was that Senior and Gates withdrew the bill from Congress in order to seek a state charter.<ref name=Titan/>

On May 14, 1913, New York Governor [[William Sulzer]] approved a state charter for the foundation – two years after the [[Carnegie Corporation]] – with Junior becoming the first president. With its large-scale endowment, a large part of Senior's fortune was insulated from inheritance taxes. The total benefactions of both him and Junior and their philanthropies in the end would far surpass Carnegie's endowments, his biographer [[Ron Chernow]] states, ranking Rockefeller as "the greatest philanthropist in American history."<ref name=Titan/>

==Early grants and connections==
The first secretary of the foundation was [[Jerome Davis Greene]], the former secretary of [[Harvard University]], who wrote a "memorandum on principles and policies" for an early meeting of the trustees that established a rough framework for the foundation's work. On December 5, the Board made its first grant of $100,000 to the [[American Red Cross]] to purchase property for its headquarters in Washington, D.C.<ref name=history1913>Rockfound.org, [http://www.rockfound.org/about_us/history/1913_1919.shtml history, 1913–1919] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070523123616/http://www.rockfound.org/about_us/history/1913_1919.shtml |date=2007-05-23 }}</ref> At the beginning the foundation was global in its approach and concentrated in its first decade entirely on the sciences, public health and medical education.

It was initially located within the [[family office]] at [[Standard Oil]]'s headquarters at [[26 Broadway]], later (in 1933) shifting to the [[GE Building]] (then [[RCA]]), along with the newly named family office, ''Room 5600'', at [[Rockefeller Center]]; later it moved to the [[Time-Life Building]] in the center, before shifting to its current [[Fifth Avenue]] address.

In 1913 the foundation set up the [[International Health Commission]] (later Board), the first appropriation of funds for work outside the US, which launched the foundation into international public health activities. This expanded the work of the [[Rockefeller Sanitary Commission|Sanitary Commission]] worldwide, working against various diseases in fifty-two countries on six continents and twenty-nine islands, bringing international recognition of the need for public health and environmental sanitation. Its early field research on [[hookworm]], [[malaria]], and [[yellow fever]] provided the basic techniques to control these diseases and established the pattern of modern public health services.<ref>Randall M. Packard, A History of Global Health, Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2016 (p. 32–43)</ref>

The commission established and endowed the world's first school of Hygiene and Public Health, at [[Johns Hopkins University]], and later at Harvard, and then spent more than $25 million in developing other public health schools in the US and in 21 foreign countries – helping to establish America as the world leader in medicine and scientific research. In 1913 it also began a 20-year support program of the ''Bureau of Social Hygiene'', whose mission was research and education on birth control, maternal health and sex education.

===Europe===
In the interwar years, the Foundation's support of public health, nursing, and social work in Eastern and Central Europe was a concentrated effort to advance medicine and create a global network of medical research.<ref>Benjamin B. Page, "The Rockefeller Foundation and Central Europe: A Reconsideration." ''Minerva'' 40#3 (2002): 265–287.</ref>  After the war, it sent a team to West Germany to investigate how it could become involved in reconstructing the country. They focused on restoring democracy, especially regarding education and scientific research, with the long-term goal of reintegrating Germany to the Western world.<ref>Carola Sachse, "What research, to what end? The Rockefeller Foundat  on and the Max Planck Gesellschaft in the early cold war." ''Central European History'' 42#1 (2009): 97–141. [https://www.academia.edu/download/36836775/BloodandHomeland.pdf#page=12 online]</ref>

===China Medical Board===

In 1914, the foundation set up the ''[[China Medical Board]]'', which established the first public health university in China, the ''[[Peking Union Medical College]]'', in 1921; this was subsequently nationalised when the Communists took over the country in 1949. In the same year it began a program of international fellowships to train scholars at the world's leading universities at the [[Post-doctoral|post-doctoral level]]; a fundamental commitment to the education of future leaders.

===Department of Industrial Relations===

Also in 1914, the trustees set up a new Department of Industrial Relations, inviting [[William Lyon Mackenzie King]] to head it. He became a close and key advisor to Junior through the [[Ludlow Massacre]], turning around his attitude to [[Labor unions in the United States|unions]]; however the foundation's involvement in IR was criticized for advancing the family's business interests.<ref>{{cite book| last=Seim| first=David L.| date=June 1, 2013| title=Rockefeller Philanthropy and Modern Social Science| location=London| publisher=Pickering & Chatto| pages=81–89| isbn=978-1848933910}}</ref> The foundation henceforth confined itself to funding responsible organizations involved in this and other controversial fields, which were beyond the control of the foundation itself.<ref>Foundation withdrew from direct involvement in Industrial Relations – see Robert Shaplen, ''Toward the Well-Being of Mankind: Fifty Years of the Rockefeller Foundation'', New York: Doubleday & Company, Inc., 1964, (p.128)</ref>

===Psychiatry===

During the late-1920s, the Rockefeller Foundation created the Medical Sciences Division, which emerged from the former Division of Medical Education. The division was led by Dr. Richard M. Pearce until his death in 1930, to which [[Alan Gregg (medical doctor)|Alan Gregg]] to succeeded him until 1945.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/ps/retrieve/Narrative/FS/p-nid/214|title=The Alan Gregg Papers: Director of Medical Sciences, 1930–1945|website=profiles.nlm.nih.gov}}</ref> During this period, the Division of Medical Sciences was known for making large contributions to research across several fields of psychiatry. The 1930s was one of the most prominent decades in Rockefeller Foundation philanthropy to psychiatric research, as the foundation set a goal to find, train, and encourage scholars for research and practice.<ref>Rockefeller Foundation, "The Strategy of Our Program in Psychiatry" (The Rockefeller Foundation, November 1, 1937), RG 3.1, series 906, box 2, folder 17, Rockefeller Archive Center, page 1, https://rockfound.rockarch.org/digital-library-listing/-/asset_publisher/yYxpQfeI4W8N/content/the-strategy-of-our-program-in-psychiatry</ref> One of the first large contributions from the Foundation to psychiatric research was in 1935, with the appropriation of $100000 to the Institute for Psychoanalysis in Chicago.<ref>Theodore Brown, Alan Gregg and the Rockefeller Foundation's Support of Franz Alexander's Psychosomatic Research, ''Bulletin of the History of Medicine'' (1987): 155–182</ref> This grant was renewed in 1938, with payments extending into the early-1940s.<ref>Rockefeller Foundation, "Annual Report, 1938," Governance Report, The Rockefeller Foundation: Annual Report (New York, NY, USA: The Rockefeller Foundation, 1939), 171, https://assets.rockefellerfoundation.org/app/uploads/20150530122134/Annual-Report-1938.pdf.</ref>

===Social sciences===

Through the ''Laura Spelman Rockefeller Memorial'' (LSRM), established by Senior in 1918 and named after his wife, the Rockefeller fortune was for the first time directed to supporting research by social scientists. During its first few years of work, the LSRM awarded funds primarily to social workers, with its funding decisions guided primarily by Junior. In 1922, Beardsley Ruml was hired to direct the LSRM, and he most decisively shifted the focus of Rockefeller philanthropy into the [[social science]]s, stimulating the founding of university research centers, and creating the [[Social Science Research Council]]. In January 1929, LSRM funds were folded into the Rockefeller Foundation, in a major reorganization.<ref>Seim, David L. (2013), pp. 103–12</ref>

Junior became the foundation chairman in 1917. One of the many prominent trustees of the institution since has been [[C. Douglas Dillon]], the [[United States Secretary of the Treasury]] under both Presidents [[John F. Kennedy]] and [[Lyndon B. Johnson]].

===Eugenics===
{{close paraphrase|section|source=https://capitalresearch.org/article/rockefellers-dubious-resilience-push/|date=July 2019}}
Beginning in 1930 the Rockefeller Foundation provided financial support to the [[Kaiser Wilhelm Institute of Anthropology, Human Heredity, and Eugenics]],<ref>Schmuhl, Hans Walter (2008). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=LeQusx57mpkC&hl=en Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Anthropology, Human Heredity and Eugenics, 1927–1945]''. [Dordrecht, Netherlands]: Springer. p. 87.</ref> which later inspired and conducted eugenics experiments in the [[Third Reich]].

The Rockefeller Foundation funded Nazi racial studies even after it was clear that this research was being used to rationalize the demonizing of Jews and other groups. Up until 1939 the Rockefeller Foundation was funding research used to support Nazi racial science studies at the [[Kaiser Wilhelm Institute of Anthropology, Human Heredity, and Eugenics]] (KWIA.) Reports submitted to Rockefeller did not hide what these studies were being used to justify, but Rockefeller continued the funding and refrained from criticizing this research so closely derived from Nazi ideology. The Rockefeller Foundation did not alert "the world to the nature of German science and the racist folly" that German anthropology promulgated, and Rockefeller funded, for years after the passage of the 1935 Nuremberg racial laws.<ref>{{cite book| first=Gretchen| last=Schafft| title=From Racism to Genocide: Anthropology in the Third Reich| location=Urbana| publisher=University of Illinois Press| pages=47–58| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=berhcMAjzZEC&q=rockefeller|year=2004| isbn=9780252029301}}</ref>

The Rockefeller Foundation, along with the [[Carnegie Institution for Science|Carnegie Institution]], was the primary financier for the [[Eugenics Record Office]], until 1939.

===Harvard International Seminars===

The foundation also supported the early initiatives of [[Henry Kissinger]], such as his directorship of Harvard's ''International Seminars'' (funded as well by the [[Central Intelligence Agency]]) and the early foreign policy magazine ''Confluence'', both established by him while he was still a graduate student.<ref>Early backing of Henry Kissinger – see [[Walter Isaacson]], ''Kissinger: A Biography'', New York: [[Simon & Schuster]], (updated) 2005, (p.72)</ref>

==Programs: scale and scope==
[[File:Senate House, University of London.jpg|thumb|[[Senate House (University of London)]] was built on donation from Rockefeller Foundation in 1926 and foundation stone laid by [[King George V]] in 1933. It is the headquarters of the [[University of London]] since 1937.]]

Through the years the foundation has expanded greatly in scope. Historically, it has given more than $14 billion in current dollars<ref name="timeline">{{cite web|url=http://www.rockfound.org/about_us/history/timeline.shtml|title=The Rockefeller Foundation Timeline|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070212213631/http://www.rockfound.org/about_us/history/timeline.shtml|archive-date=2007-02-12}}</ref> to thousands of grantees worldwide and has assisted directly in the training of nearly 13,000 Rockefeller Fellows.

Its overall philanthropic activity has been divided into five main subject areas:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rockarch.org/collections/rf/|title=The Rockefeller Archive Center – Rockefeller Foundation Archives|website=www.rockarch.org}}</ref>
* Medical, health, and population sciences
* Agricultural and natural sciences
* Arts and humanities
* Social sciences
* International relations

In the 1920s, the Rockefeller Foundation started a program to eradicate hookworm in Mexico. The program exemplified the time period's confidence in science as the solution for everything.<ref>{{cite journal| last=Birn| first=Anne-Emanuelle| author2=Armando Solórzano |title=Public health policy paradoxes: science and politics in the Rockefeller Foundation's hookworm campaign in Mexico in the 1920s| journal=Social Science & Medicine| year=1999| volume=49| issue=9| pages=1197–1213| doi=10.1016/S0277-9536(99)00160-4| pmid=10501641}}</ref> This reliance on science was known as scientific neutrality. The Rockefeller Foundation program stated that there was a crucial correlation between the world of science, politics and international health policy. This heavy reliance of scientific neutrality contradicted the hookworm program's fundamental objective to invest in public health in order to develop better social conditions and to establish positive ties between the United States and Mexico.<ref>{{cite journal| last=Birn| first=Anne-Emanuelle| author2=Armando Solórzano |title=Public health policy paradoxes: science and politics in the Rockefeller Foundation's hookworm campaign in Mexico in the 1920s| journal=Social Science & Medicine| year=1999| volume=49| issue=9| pages=1197–1210| doi=10.1016/S0277-9536(99)00160-4| pmid=10501641}}</ref> The Hookworm Campaign set the terms of the relationship between Mexico and the Rockefeller Foundation that persisted through subsequent programs including the development of a network of local public health departments. The importance of the hookworm campaign was to get a foot in the door and swiftly convince rural people of the value of public health work. The roles of the RF's hookworm campaign are characteristic of the policy paradoxes that emerge when science is summoned to drive policy. The campaign in Mexico served as a policy cauldron through which new knowledge could be demonstrated applicable to social and political problems on many levels.<ref>{{cite journal| last=Birn| first=Anne-Emanuelle| author2=Armando Solórzano| title=Public health policy paradoxes: science and politics in the Rockefeller Foundation's hookworm campaign in Mexico in the 1920s| journal=Social Science & Medicine| year=1999| volume=49| issue=9| pages=1209–1210| doi=10.1016/s0277-9536(99)00160-4| pmid=10501641}}</ref>

A major program beginning in the 1930s was the relocation of German (Jewish) scholars from German universities to America. This was expanded to other European countries after the ''[[Anschluss]]'' occurred; when war broke out it became a full-scale rescue operation. Another program, the ''Emergency Rescue Committee'' was also partly funded with Rockefeller money; this effort resulted in the rescue of some of the most famous artists, writers and composers of Europe. Some of the notable figures relocated or saved (out of a total of 303 scholars) by the Foundation were [[Thomas Mann]], [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]] and [[Leó Szilárd]], enriching intellectual life and academic disciplines in the US. This came to light afterwards through a brief, unpublished history of the Foundation's program.<ref>{{cite book| last1=Harr| first1=John Ensor| first2=Peter J.| last2=Johnson| title=The Rockefeller Century: Three Generations of America's Greatest Family| location=New York| publisher=[[Charles Scribner's Sons]]| date=August 10, 1988| quote=Major rescue program of European scholars| pages=[https://archive.org/details/rockefellercentu00harr/page/401 401]–03| isbn=978-0684189369| url-access=registration| url=https://archive.org/details/rockefellercentu00harr}}</ref>

Another significant program was its Medical Sciences Division, which extensively funded women's contraception and the human reproductive system in general. Other funding went into [[endocrinology]] departments in American universities, human heredity, mammalian biology, human physiology and anatomy, [[psychology]], and the studies of human sexual behavior by Dr. [[Alfred Kinsey]].<ref>Harr, John Ensor, and Peter J. Johnson, ''The Rockefeller Century: Three Generations of America's Greatest Family''. Medical Sciences Division and Alfred Kinsey funding, p.456.</ref>

[[File:Virus Laboratory Fieldwork.jpg|right|thumb|250px|[[Trinidad Regional Virus Laboratory]] Field Assistant, [[Nariva Swamp]], [[Trinidad]]. 1959]]
In 1950 the Foundation mounted a major program of virus research, establishing field laboratories in [[Poona]], India; [[Port of Spain]], [[Trinidad and Tobago|Trinidad]]; [[Belém]], Brazil; [[Johannesburg]], South Africa; [[Cairo]], Egypt; [[Ibadan]], Nigeria; and [[Cali]], Colombia.{{citation needed|date=September 2009}} In time, major funding was also contributed by the countries involved, while in Trinidad the [[British government]] and neighbouring British-controlled territories also assisted. Sub-professional staff were almost all recruited locally and, wherever possible, local people were given scholarships and other support to be professionally trained. In most cases, locals eventually took over management of the facilities. Support was also given to research on viruses in many other countries. The result of all this research was the identification of a huge number of viruses affecting humans, the development of new techniques for the rapid identification of viruses, and a quantum leap in our understanding of [[arthropod]]-borne viruses.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Arthropod-Borne Viruses of Vertebrates: An Account of The Rockefeller Foundation Virus Program, 1951–1970 |pages=xvii, xx |author-link1=Max Theiler |first1=Max |last1=Theiler |author-link2=W.

In the arts it has helped establish or support the [[Stratford Shakespeare Festival]] in [[Ontario]], Canada, and the American Shakespeare Festival in [[Stratford, Connecticut]]; [[Arena Stage]] in Washington, D.C.; [[Karamu House]] in [[Cleveland, Ohio]]; and [[Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts]] in New York. In a recent shift{{When|date=February 2011}} in program emphasis, President Rodin eliminated the division that spent money on the arts, the creativity and culture program. One program that signals the shift was the foundation's support as the underwriter of [[Spike Lee]]'s documentary on [[New Orleans]], ''[[When the Levees Broke]]''. The film has been used as the basis for a curriculum on poverty, developed by the Teachers College at [[Columbia University]] for their students.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/14/us/14foundation.html "Charities Try to Keep Up With the Gateses"] ''[[The New York Times]]'', 2007</ref>

Thousands of scientists and scholars from all over the world have received foundation fellowships and scholarships for advanced study in major scientific disciplines. In addition, the foundation has provided significant and often substantial research grants to finance conferences and assist with published studies, as well as funding departments and programs, to a vast range of foreign policy and educational organizations, including:{{citation needed|date=September 2009}}

==Notable programs==
The Rockefeller Foundation has accomplished some notable achievements, such as:

* Financially supported education in the United States "without distinction of race, sex or creed"<ref name="rock-o-h">{{cite web|url=http://www.rockefellerfoundation.org/who-we-are/our-history/|title=Our History – A Powerful Legacy|publisher=The Rockefeller Foundation|access-date=2011-08-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121030182542/http://www.rockefellerfoundation.org/who-we-are/our-history/|archive-date=2012-10-30|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The foundation also funded several infamous projects:

* Various German [[eugenics]] programs, including the laboratory of [[Otmar Freiherr von Verschuer]], for whom [[Josef Mengele]] worked before he went to [[Auschwitz]].
* The construction of the [[Kaiser Wilhelm Institute]]'s [[Max Planck Institute for Brain Research|Institute for Brain Research]] with a $317,000 grant in 1929, with continuing support for the institute's operations under [[Ernst Rüdin]] over the next several years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hnn.us/article/1796|title=The Horrifying American Roots of Nazi Eugenics|last=Black|first=Edwin|author-link=Edwin Black|date=September 2003|publisher=History News Network}} (Also published at [http://www.sfgate.com/opinion/article/Eugenics-and-the-Nazis-the-California-2549771.php San Francisco Chronicle]).

==The Green Revolution==
{{Main|Green Revolution}}
Agriculture was introduced to the Natural Sciences division of the foundation in the major reorganization of 1928. In 1941, the foundation gave a small grant to [[Mexico]] for maize research, in collaboration with the then new president, [[Manuel Ávila Camacho]]. This was done after the intervention of vice-president [[Henry A. Wallace|Henry Wallace]] and the involvement of [[Nelson Rockefeller]]; the primary intention being to stabilise the Mexican Government and derail any possible communist infiltration, in order to protect the Rockefeller family's investments.<ref name=Green>The story of the Foundation and the Green Revolution – see Mark Dowie, ''American Foundations: An Investigative History'', Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press, 2001, (pp.105–140)</ref>

By 1943 this program, under the foundation's ''Mexican Agriculture Project'', had proved such a success with the science of corn propagation and general principles of [[agronomy]] that it was exported to other Latin American countries; in 1956 the program was then taken to India; again with the geopolitical imperative of providing an antidote to communism.<ref name=Green/> It wasn't until 1959 that senior foundation officials succeeded in getting the [[Ford Foundation]] (and later [[USAID]], and later still, the [[World Bank]]) to sign on to the major philanthropic project, known now to the world as the [[Green Revolution]]. It was originally conceived in 1943 as [[CIMMYT]], the [[International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center]] in Mexico. It also provided significant funding for the [[International Rice Research Institute]] in the [[Philippines]]. Part of the original program, the funding of the IRRI was later taken over by the Ford Foundation.<ref name=Green/> The [[International Rice Research Institute]] and the [[International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center]] are part of a consortium of agricultural research organizations known as [[CGIAR]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gatesnotes.com/Development/How-CGIAR-is-feeding-our-future |title=You've probably never heard of CGIAR, but they are essential to feeding our future |website=gatesnotes.com|language=en-US|access-date=2020-05-18}}</ref>

Costing around $600 million, over 50 years, the revolution brought new farming technology, increased productivity, expanded crop yields and mass fertilization to many countries throughout the world. Later it funded over $100 million of plant [[biotechnology]] research and trained over four hundred scientists from Asia, Africa and Latin America. It also invested in the production of [[transgenic]] crops, including rice and maize. In 1999, the then president Gordon Conway addressed the [[Monsanto Company]] board of directors, warning of the possible social and environmental dangers of this biotechnology, and requesting them to disavow the use of so-called terminator genes;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.biotech-info.net/gordon_conway.html|title=العاب فلاش برق|website=www.biotech-info.net}}</ref> the company later complied.

In the 1990s, the foundation shifted its agriculture work and emphasis to Africa; in 2006 it joined with the [[Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://terravivagrants.org/grant-makers/cross-cutting/rockefeller-foundation/|title=Rockefeller Foundation {{!}} Terra Viva Grants Directory|website=terravivagrants.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-01-03}}</ref> in a $150 million effort to fight hunger in the continent through improved agricultural productivity. In an interview marking the 100 year anniversary of the Rockefeller Foundation, [[Judith Rodin]] explained to [[This Is Africa]] that Rockefeller has been involved in Africa since their beginning in three main areas – health, agriculture and education, though agriculture has been and continues to be their largest investment in Africa.<ref name="This Is Africa">{{cite web |url=http://www.thisisafricaonline.com/Microsites/Agriculture |title=A century of innovation? Philanthropy and the African growth story |access-date=5 August 2013 |url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170321070222/http://www.thisisafricaonline.com/Microsites/Agriculture|archive-date=2017-03-21}}</ref>

==Bellagio Center==
The foundation also owns and operates the Rockefeller Foundation Bellagio Center in [[Bellagio, Italy]]. The Center comprises several buildings, spread across a {{convert|50|acre|m2|adj=on}} property, on the peninsula between lakes [[Lake Como|Como]] and [[Lecco]] in [[Northern Italy]]. The center is sometimes colloquially referred to as the ''Villa Serbelloni.'' The Villa is only one of the many buildings in which residents and conference participants are housed. The property was bequeathed to the Foundation in 1959 under the presidency of [[Dean Rusk]] (who was later to become [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[John F Kennedy|Kennedy]]'s secretary of state).
The Bellagio Center operates both a conference center and a residency program.<ref>[http://www.rockefellerfoundation.org/bellagio-center The Bellagio Center]. The Rockefeller Foundation. Retrieved on 2013-08-24.</ref> The residency program is a highly competitive program to which scholars, artists, writers, musicians, scientists, policymakers and development professionals from around the world can apply to work on a project of their own choosing for a period of four weeks. The essence of the program is the synergy obtained by the interaction between people coming from the most diverse backgrounds.
Numerous [[Nobel laureates]], [[Pulitzer Prize|Pulitzer]] winners, [[National Book Award]] recipients, [[Prince Mahidol Award]] winners and [[MacArthur fellows]], as well as several acting and former heads of State and Government, have been in residence at Bellagio.

== Rockefeller Foundation Communication for Social Change Network ==
The network is enabled by the Rockefeller Foundation for collaboration between experts and [[Professional communication|communication professionals]] that include grassroots/community-based and international non-governmental organizations, as well as multilateral and bilateral entities. Its involvement in AIDS prevention, was based on promoting deep-rooted social changes that stem from informed and inclusive public engagement. However, it recognized that wide-scale educational campaigns focused on altering individual behavior played a critical role.

The strategy and principles linked with the network are listed below:
* "Sustainability of social change is more likely if the individuals and communities most affected ''own'' the process and content of communication."<ref name=":0">{{cite journal| last=Scalway| first=Thomas| year=2003| title=Missing the Message? 20 Years of Learning from HIV/AIDS| journal=Panos Institute| pages=21}}</ref>
* "Communication for social change should be empowering, horizontal (versus top-down), give a voice to the previously unheard members of the community, and be biased towards local content and ownership."<ref name=":0" />
* "Communities should be the agents of their own change."<ref name=":0" />
* "Emphasis should shift from persuasion and the transmission of information from outside technical experts to dialogue, debate and negotiation on issues that resonate with members of the community."<ref name=":0" />
* "Emphasis on outcomes should go beyond individual behaviour to social norms, policies, culture and the supporting environment."<ref name=":0" />

==100 Resilient Cities==
{{close paraphrasing|section|source=http://www.100resilientcities.org/about-us/#/-_/|date=July 2019}}
In December 2013, The Rockefeller Foundation launched the 100 Resilient Cities initiative, which is dedicated to promoting [[urban resilience]], defined as "the capacity of individuals, communities, institutions, businesses, and systems within a city to survive, adapt, and grow no matter what kinds of chronic stresses and acute shocks they experience."<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.100resilientcities.org/resilience#/-_/| title=City Resilience| publisher=100 Resilient Cities| access-date=16 March 2017}}</ref>

Through its program, 100 Resilient Cities offers cities the following resources:<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.100resilientcities.org/about-us//#/-_/| title=About 100RC| publisher=100 Resilient Cities| access-date=16 March 2017}}</ref>
* Financial and logistical guidance for establishing an innovative new position in city government, a Chief Resilience Officer, who will lead the city's resilience efforts
* Expert support for development of a robust resilience strategy
* Access to solutions, service providers, and partners from the private, public and NGO sectors who can help them develop and implement their resilience strategies
* Membership of a global network of member cities who can learn from and help each other
A total of 100 cities across six continents are part of the program, as of May 2016.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/may/25/rockefeller-100-resilient-cities-washington-lagos-manchester-belfast| title=About 100RC| work=[[The Guardian]]| access-date=16 March 2017}}</ref> All 100 cities have developed individual City Resilience Strategies with technical support from a Chief Resilience Officer (CRO). The CRO ideally reports directly to the city's chief executive and helps coordinate all the resilience efforts in a single city.

In January 2016, the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development announced winners of its National Disaster Resilience Competition (NDRC), awarding three 100RC member cities – New York, NY; Norfolk, VA; and New Orleans, LA – with more than $437 million in disaster resilience funding.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.rockefellerfoundation.org/about-us/news-media/hud-awards-1-billion-through-national-disaster-resilience-competition/| title=About 100RC| publisher=Rockefeller Foundation| access-date=16 March 2017}}</ref> The grant was the largest ever received by the city of Norfolk.

== Cultural Innovation Fund ==
The Cultural Innovation Fund is a pilot grant program that is overseen by [[Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts|Lincoln Center for the Arts]]. The Rockefeller Foundation selected [[Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts|Lincoln Center]] to administer the fund based on the institutions steady track record in creating community based partnerships and implementing art based programs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.aboutlincolncenter.org/press-room/release/1017?category_id=76|title=Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts|website=www.aboutlincolncenter.org|access-date=2017-11-09}}</ref><ref name=":1">{{Cite news|url=https://www.rockefellerfoundation.org/about-us/news-media/lincoln-center-rockefeller-foundation-inaugural-grantees-cultural-innovation-fund/|title=Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts in Partnership with The Rockefeller Foundation Announces Inaugural Grantees of Lincoln Center Cultural Innovation Fund – The Rockefeller Foundation|work=The Rockefeller Foundation|access-date=2017-11-09|language=en-US}}</ref> The grants are to be used towards innovative ideas that would bring art access and foster cultural opportunities in the underserved areas of [[Brooklyn]] and the [[South Bronx]]<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://philanthropynewsdigest.org/news/lincoln-center-cultural-innovation-fund-awards-innovation-fund-grants|title=Lincoln Center Cultural Innovation Fund Awards Innovation Fund Grants|work=Philanthropy News Digest (PND)|access-date=2017-11-09}}</ref> with three overarching goals. 
* Increase access to the arts in underserved neighborhoods around [[New York City]] 
* increase the "places and platforms" where cultural activities are taking place
* support nonprofit organizations in implementing cultural based programs and strategies<ref name=":1" />

==Family involvement==
The Rockefeller family helped lead the foundation in its early years, but later limited itself to one or two representatives, to maintain the foundation's independence and avoid charges of undue family influence. These representatives have included the former president [[John D. Rockefeller III]], and then his son [[John D. Rockefeller, IV]], who gave up the trusteeship in 1981. In 1989, [[David Rockefeller]]'s daughter, [[Peggy Dulany]], was appointed to the board for a five-year term.

In October 2006, [[David Rockefeller, Jr.]] joined the board of trustees, re-establishing the direct family link and becoming the sixth family member to serve on the board. By contrast, the [[Ford Foundation]] has severed all direct links with the Ford family.{{citation needed|date=September 2009}}

Stock in the family's oil companies is a major part of the foundation's assets, beginning with [[Standard Oil]] and now with its corporate descendants, including [[Exxon Mobil]].<ref>Share portfolio – see Waldemar Nielsen ''The Big Foundations'', New York: Columbia University Press, 1972.

==Historical legacy==

The second-oldest major philanthropic institution in America, after the [[Carnegie Corporation]], the foundation's impact on philanthropy in general has been profound. It has supported [[United Nations]] programs throughout its history, such as the recent ''First Global Forum On Human Development'', organized by the ''United Nations Development Programme'' (UNDP) in 1999.<ref>"Global Forum on Human Development". Originally retrieved at ''Hdr.undp.org'' on 2013-08-24. Not available at ''[http://report.hdr.undp.org/ report.hdr.undp.org]'' 2017-01-07.</ref>

The early institutions it set up have served as models for current organizations: the UN's [[World Health Organization]], set up in 1948, is modeled on the International Health Division; the U.S. Government's [[National Science Foundation]] (1950) on its approach in support of research, scholarships and institutional development; and the [[National Institute of Health]] (1950) imitated its longstanding medical programs.<ref>"Global Forum on Human Development" (1999). As model for UN organizations, pp.64-5.</ref>
