'''Free Press''' was an independent book publisher that later became an imprint of [[Simon & Schuster]]. It was one of the best-known publishers specializing in serious nonfiction, including path-breaking sociology books of the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s. After a period under new ownership in the 1980s of publishing [[neoconservative]] books, it was purchased by Simon & Schuster in 1994. By 2012, the imprint ceased to exist as a distinct entity; however, some books were still being published using the Free Press imprint.<ref name=sisario/><ref>{{Cite news|last=Lyall|first=Sarah|date=1994-04-05|title=Conservative Publisher Is Leaving Paramount for Penguin|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/05/business/conservative-publisher-is-leaving-paramount-for-penguin.html|access-date=2020-10-05|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>

==History==
Free Press was founded by [[Jeremiah Kaplan]] (1926â€“1993) and Charles Liebman in 1947 and concentrated on religion and social science.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Pace|first=Eric|date=1993-08-11|title=Jeremiah Kaplan, Veteran Executive In Publishing, 67|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/11/obituaries/jeremiah-kaplan-veteran-executive-in-publishing-67.html|access-date=2020-10-04|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> They chose the name Free Press because they wanted to print books devoted to civil liberties. It was launched with three classic titles: [[The Division of Labour in Society|''Division of Labor'']] by [[Emile Durkheim]], [[Economy and Society|''The Theory of Economic and Social Organization'']] by [[Max Weber]] and ''The Scientific Outlook'' by [[Bertrand Russell]].<ref name=kelley>{{cite web |url=http://mhpbooks.com/the-complicated-history-of-free-press-takes-another-turn/ |title=After 65 years, Free Press to be absorbed into Simon & Schuster flagship |publisher=[[Melville House Publishing]] |author=Claire Kelley |date=October 24, 2012 |accessdate=October 24, 2012}}</ref> It was headquartered in [[Glencoe, Illinois]], where it was known as ''The Free Press of Glencoe''. 

In 1960, Kaplan was recruited by Macmillan to provide new editorial leadership and he agreed to move to New York if [[Macmillan Publishers (United States)|Macmillan Publishing Company]] would buy Free Press, and thus Free Press was sold in 1960 for $1.3 million ($500,000 going to Kaplan and $800,000 going to Liebman).<ref name=kelley/> 

In 1994, Simon & Schuster acquired Macmillan and Free Press.<ref name=kelley/> In 2012, it was announced that Free Press would cease to exist as a distinct entity and would be merged into [[Simon & Schuster]], the company's flagship imprint.<ref name=kelley/><ref name=sisario>{{cite web |url=http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/23/after-consolidation-at-simon-schuster-top-two-at-free-press-are-leaving/ |title=After Consolidation at Simon & Schuster, Top Two at Free Press Are Leaving |work=[[New York Times]] |author=Ben Sisario |date=October 23, 2012 |accessdate=October 23, 2012}}</ref> "We plan to continue publishing thought leaders and other important cultural voices under the Free Press imprimatur, while also introducing many other Free Press authors, such as novelists and historians and business writers, to the flagship Simon & Schuster imprint."<ref name=kelley/>
