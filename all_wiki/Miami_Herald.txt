==History==
[[File:Miami Herald 07 August 1945.jpg|thumb|left|A ''Miami Herald'' headline dated August 7, 1945 featuring the [[atomic bombing]] of [[Hiroshima, Japan]]]]

===Early history===
The first edition was published September 15, 1903, as ''The Miami Evening Record''. After the recession of 1907, the newspaper had severe financial difficulties. Its largest creditor was [[Henry Flagler]]. Through a loan from Henry Flagler, Frank B. Shutts, who was also the founder of the law firm [[Shutts & Bowen]], acquired the paper and renamed it the ''Miami Herald'' on December 1, 1910. Although it is the longest continuously published newspaper in Miami, the earliest newspaper in the region was ''[[The Tropical Sun]]'', established in 1891. ''The Miami Metropolis'', which later became ''[[The Miami News]]'', was founded in 1896, and was the ''Herald''{{'}}s oldest competitor until 1988, when it went out of business.{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}}

During the [[Florida land boom of the 1920s]], the ''Miami Herald'' was the largest newspaper in the world, as measured by lines of advertising.<ref>{{cite book|last=Smiley|first=Nixon|title=Knights of the Fourth Estate: The Story of the Miami Herald|location=Miami|publisher=E.&nbsp;A.&nbsp;Seeman|year=1974|isbn=978-0-912458-42-7|page=54}}</ref> During [[The Great Depression]] in the 1930s, the ''Herald'' came close to [[receivership]], but recovered.

On October 25, 1939, [[John S. Knight]], son of a noted [[Ohio]] newspaperman, bought the ''Herald'' from Frank B. Shutts. Knight became editor and publisher, and made his brother, [[James L. Knight]], the business manager. The ''Herald'' had 383 employees. [[Lee Hills (journalist)|Lee Hills]] arrived as city editor in September 1942. He later became the ''Herald''{{'}}s publisher and eventually the chairman of [[Knight Ridder|Knight-Ridder Inc.]], a position he held until 1981.

===Post-war history===
''The Miami Herald International Edition'', printed by partner newspapers throughout the [[Caribbean]] and [[Latin America]], began in 1946. It is commonly available at resorts in the Caribbean countries such as [[the Dominican Republic]], and, though printed by the largest local newspaper ''[[Listín Diario]]'', it is not available outside such tourist areas. It was extended to Mexico in 2002.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/The-Miami-Herald|title=The Miami Herald {{!}} American newspaper|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-08-25|language=en}}</ref>

The ''Herald'' won its first Pulitzer Prize in 1950, for its reporting on Miami's [[organized crime]]. Its circulation was 176,000 daily and 204,000 on Sundays.

On August 19, 1960, construction began on the ''Herald'' building on [[Biscayne Bay]]. Also on that day, [[Alvah Chapman, Jr.|Alvah H. Chapman]], started work as James Knight's assistant. Chapman was later promoted to Knight-Ridder chairman and chief executive officer. The ''Herald'' moved into its new building at One Herald Plaza without missing an edition on March 23–24, 1963.

The paper won a landmark press freedom decision in ''[[Miami Herald Publishing Co. v. Tornillo]]'' (1974).<ref name=obit>{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-21201322.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130509083623/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-21201322.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=May 9, 2013 |title=Dan Paul, 85, leading lawyer for press freedom|author=Dennis Hevesi|date=February 2, 2010|work=The Boston Globe|publisher={{Subscription required|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}|access-date=April 24, 2013}}</ref> In the case, Pat Tornillo Jr., president of the United Teachers of Dade, had requested that the ''Herald'' print his rebuttal to an editorial criticizing him, citing Florida's "right-to-reply" law, which mandated that newspapers print such responses. Represented by longtime counsel [[Dan Paul]], the ''Herald'' challenged the law, and the case was appealed to the Supreme Court.<ref name="CampbellMartin2012">{{cite book|author1=Richard Campbell|author2=Christopher R.

Publication of a [[Spanish-language]] supplemental insert named ''El Herald'' began in 1976. It was renamed ''[[El Nuevo Herald]]'' in 1987, and in 1998 became an independent publication.

===Recent history and Arthur Teele suicide===
In 2003, the ''Miami Herald'' and ''[[El Universal (Mexico City)|El Universal]]'' of Mexico City created an international joint venture, and in 2004 they together launched ''[[The Herald Mexico]]'', a short-lived [[English-language]] newspaper for readers in Mexico. Its final issue was published in May 2007.

On July 27, 2005, former Miami city commissioner [[Arthur Teele]] walked into the main lobby of the ''Herald''{{'}}s headquarters and phoned ''Herald'' columnist [[Jim DeFede]] (one of several telephone conversations that the two had had during the day) to say that he had a package for DeFede. He then asked a security officer to tell his (Teele's) wife Stephanie that he loved her, before pulling out a gun and committing [[suicide]].<ref name="Carlson2005">{{cite news|last=Carlson|first=Coralie|title=Former Miami commissioner Teele is dead, police say|url=http://staugustine.com/stories/072805/sta_3230330.shtml|access-date=July 30, 2017|work=[[St. Augustine Record]]|agency=[[Associated Press]]|date=July 28, 2005|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170730112620/http://staugustine.com/stories/072805/sta_3230330.shtml|archive-date=July 30, 2017|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> This happened the day the ''[[Miami New Times]]'', a weekly newspaper, published salacious details of Teele's alleged affairs, including allegations that he had had sex and used [[cocaine]] with a [[transsexual]] [[prostitute]].

The day before committing suicide, Teele had had another telephone conversation with DeFede, who recorded this call without Teele's knowledge, which was illegal under Florida law. DeFede admitted to the ''Herald''{{'}}s management that he had taped the call. Although the paper used quotes from the tape in its coverage, DeFede was fired the next day for violating the paper's code of ethics, and he was likely guilty of a felony.

Many journalists and readers of the ''Herald'' disagreed with the decision to fire rather than suspend DeFede, arguing that it had been made in haste and that the punishment was disproportionate to the offense. 528 journalists, including about 200 current and former ''Herald'' staffers, called on the ''Herald'' to reinstate DeFede, but the paper's management refused to back down. The state attorney's office later declined to file charges against the columnist, holding that the potential violation was "without a (living) victim or a complainant".<ref>{{cite web|title=Miami Code Violations on the Rise|url=http://www.codeviolationcenter.com/2016/01/27/miami-code-violations-on-the-rise/|access-date=March 25, 2016|website=Code Violation Center|date=January 27, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160407193320/http://www.codeviolationcenter.com/2016/01/27/miami-code-violations-on-the-rise/|archive-date=April 7, 2016|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

On September 8, 2006, the ''Miami Herald''{{'}}s president Jesús Díaz, Jr. fired three journalists because they had allegedly been paid by the [[United States government]] to work for anti-[[Cuba]] [[propaganda]] TV and radio channels. The three were Pablo Alfonso, Wilfredo Cancio Isla and Olga Connor.<ref name="BBC">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/5329394.stm|title=US 'paid anti-Cuba journalists'|publisher=BBC News|date=September 9, 2006|access-date=September 9, 2006}}</ref> Less than a month later, responding to pressure from the Cuban community in Miami, Díaz resigned after reinstating the fired journalists. Nevertheless, he continues to claim that such payments, especially if made from organs of the state, violate the principles of [[Journalism ethics and standards|journalistic independence]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/local/palmbeach/sfl-pcherald04oct04,0,1401914.story?coll=sfla-news-palm|title=Herald Publisher Resigns|work=Sun‑Sentinel|first1=Vanessa|last1=Bauzá|first2=Madeline|last2=Baró Diaz|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151022153333/http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2006-10-04/news/0610030659_1_herald-s-spanish-language-sister-nuevo-cuban|archive-date=October 22, 2015|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> At least seven other journalists who do not work at the ''Herald'', namely Miguel Cossio, Carlos Alberto Montaner, Juan Manuel Cao, Ariel Remos, Omar Claro, Helen Aguirre Ferre, Paul Crespo, and Ninoska Perez-Castellón, were also paid for programs on [[Radio Martí]] or [[TV Martí]],<ref name="BBC"/><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.miami.com/mld/miamiherald/15466239.htm|title=10 Miami journalists take U.S. pay|work=Miami Herald|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070103151514/http://www.miami.com/mld/miamiherald/15466239.htm|archive-date=January 3, 2007|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> both financed by the government of the United States through the [[Broadcasting Board of Governors]], receiving a total of between {{US$|link=yes}}15,000 and {{US$}}175,000 since 2001.

In November 2018, the ''Herald'' broke the story that "in 2007, despite substantial evidence that corroborated (female teenager's) stories of (sexual) abuse by [[Jeffrey Epstein|Epstein]], the U.S. attorney in Miami, [[Alexander Acosta]], signed off on a secret deal for the multimillionaire, one that ensured he would never spend a day in prison."

==Community involvement==
The ''Miami Herald'' sponsors several community involvement projects, such as those detailed below.

The Wish Book program lets community members who are suffering from hardships ask for help from the paper's readers. Wishes have included asking for donations to buy medical equipment for a sick child, help with renovations to make a home [[wheelchair]]-accessible, monetary donations to an impoverished family dealing with [[cancer]] treatments, and help to an elderly resident wanting to learn how to use a [[computer]]. Readers may donate to specific causes or to the program at large.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

The ''Herald'' also co-sponsors spelling bees and athletic awards in South Florida. {{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

The "Tropic" section and its columnist [[Dave Barry]] run the [[Herald Hunt]], a unique annual [[puzzlehunt]] in the Miami area.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

===Miami Herald Silver Knight Awards===
The Miami Herald Silver Knight Awards is one of most highly regarded student awards programs in the United States. The Awards program recognizes outstanding individuals and leaders who have maintained good grades and have applied their knowledge and talents to contribute service to their schools and communities. The Silver Knight Awards program was instituted at the Miami Herald in 1959 by [[John S. Knight]], past publisher of The Miami Herald, founder and editor emeritus of [[Knight-Ridder|Knight-Ridder Newspapers]] and winner of the 1968 [[Pulitzer Prize]] for Editorial Writing<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pulitzer.org/prize-winners-by-year/1968|title=1968 Pulitzer Prize Winners & Finalists - The Pulitzer Prizes|access-date=May 28, 2020}}</ref>.

The program is open to high school seniors with a minimum 3.2 [[Grading in education|GPA]] (unweighted) in public, charter, private, and parochial schools in [[Miami-Dade County, Florida|Miami-Dade]] and [[Broward County, Florida|Broward]] counties. Students may be recognized in one of 15 categories: Art, Athletics, Business, Digital and Interactive (previously New Media), Drama, English and Literature, General Scholarship, Journalism, Mathematics, Music and Dance, Science, Social Science, Speech, Vocational-Technical, and World Languages. Each school may only nominate one student per category. 

A panel of independent judges appointed by the Miami Herald for each category interviews the nominees in that category. Each panel selects one Silver Knight and three Honorable Mentions in its category for each of the two counties (30 Silver Knights and 90 Honorable Mentions each year). The honorees are revealed during the Silver Knight Awards ceremony, televised locally from Miami's [[Knight Center Complex|James L. Knight Center]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/site-services/miami-herald-events/silver-knight/article1930302.html|title=Silver Knight: Qualifications & Nomination Process|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160328211726/http://www.miamiherald.com/site-services/miami-herald-events/silver-knight/article1930302.html|archive-date=March 28, 2016|newspaper=Miami Herald|date=October 29, 2008|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/site-services/miami-herald-events/silver-knight/article1930300.html|title=What is a Silver Knight?|date=October 29, 2008|newspaper=Miami Herald|access-date=October 17, 2016}}</ref> In 2020, Silver Knights received a $2,000 scholarship, a Silver Knight statue, an [[AAdvantage]] 25,000-mile travel certificate and a medallion (from sponsor [[American Airlines]]). Honorable Mentions each received a $500 scholarship and an engraved plaque.

Because of the [[COVID-19 pandemic]], the 2020 awards ceremony was live-streamed on May 28 from a video studio at the Miami Herald's newsroom; the nominees attended via [[Zoom (software)|Zoom]] video conference.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/education/article243058181.html|title=Silver Knights are extraordinary.

The Silver Knight Awards have been given in Miami-Dade County since 1959 and in Broward County since 1984. Silver Knight Awards were given to [[Palm Beach County, Florida|Palm Beach County]] students from 1985 through 1990<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.miamiherald.com/site-services/miami-herald-events/silver-knight/article1928928.html|title=Silver Knight success stories: Where are they now?|newspaper=Miami Herald|date=May 6, 2007|access-date=May 28, 2020}}</ref>. The program is sponsored by organizations with ties to South Florida; the cash awards have been made possible over the years in part by the support of the [[John S. and James L. Knight Foundation]] and the [[Arthur Blank|Arthur M. Blank]] Family Foundation [https://blankfoundation.org/ (website)].
