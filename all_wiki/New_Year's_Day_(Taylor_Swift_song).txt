Antonoff described that the song "happened so quickly at my apartment.

About the lyrics, Swift said that "I was thinking about how everybody talks and thinks about who you kiss at midnight [...] But I think there's something even more romantic about who's gonna deal with you on New Year's Day. Who's willing to give you [[Advil]] and clean up the house? I think that states more of a permanence."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cmt.com/news/1788832/the-inspiration-behind-taylor-swifts-new-years-day/|title=The Inspiration Behind Taylor Swift's "New Year's Day"|website=CMT News|last=Tingle|first=Lauren|date=November 16, 2018|accessdate=March 5, 2018|archive-date=November 17, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171117072953/http://www.cmt.com/news/1788832/the-inspiration-behind-taylor-swifts-new-years-day/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/8031285/taylor-swift-siriusxm-call-it-what-you-want-new-years-day-american-girl|title=Taylor Swift Treats Lucky Fans to Intimate Acoustic Set at SiriusXM|work=Billboard|last=Stubblebine|first=Allison|date=November 10, 2017|accessdate=March 5, 2018|archive-date=November 12, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171112122928/http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/8031285/taylor-swift-siriusxm-call-it-what-you-want-new-years-day-american-girl|url-status=live}}</ref> "New Year's Day" was one of the last tracks unveiled before ''Reputation'' was released, which debuted at a commercial break for the November 9 episode of ABC's ''[[Scandal (TV series)|Scandal]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/country/news/taylor-swifts-new-years-day-sent-to-country-radio-w512049|title=Taylor Swift's 'New Year's Day' Serviced to Country Radio|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|last=McKenna|first=Brittney|date=November 16, 2017|accessdate=March 19, 2017|archive-date=November 17, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171117000220/http://www.rollingstone.com/country/news/taylor-swifts-new-years-day-sent-to-country-radio-w512049|url-status=live}}</ref> The song was serviced to American country radio as the album's fourth single on November 27, 2017.<ref name="Billboard">{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/country/8039304/taylor-swift-new-years-day-reputation-country-radio|title=Taylor Swift's 'New Year's Day' Goes to Country Radio: Is Country Ready for It?|website=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|last1=Trust|first1=Gary|last2=Asker|first2=Jim|date=November 17, 2017|accessdate=March 19, 2017|archive-date=April 23, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180423044757/https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/country/8039304/taylor-swift-new-years-day-reputation-country-radio|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Critical reception==
The song received positive reviews from critics. ''[[New York (magazine)|Vulture]]'' said: "'New Year's Day' isn't the best song on ''Reputation'', but it's one of the best, and like the rest of the good ones it excels because the petulant sense of betrayal that fuels the album elsewhere has receded. It turns out, that, once she [Swift] puts herself in position to express emotions more common and profound than the sense of being an ultrafamous pop musician who got exposed by other ultrafamous celebrities as cold-blooded and duplicitous, that she's still an artistic force to be reckoned with."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vulture.com/2017/11/reviewing-taylor-swifts-new-years-day-and-end-game.html|title=Reviewing Taylor Swift's 'New Year's Day' and 'End Game'|work=Vulture|last=Guan|first=Frank|date=November 10, 2017|accessdate=March 4, 2018|archive-date=December 22, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171222162359/http://www.vulture.com/2017/11/reviewing-taylor-swifts-new-years-day-and-end-game.html|url-status=live}}</ref>
