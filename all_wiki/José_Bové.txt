'''Joseph (José) Bové''' (born 11 June 1953 in [[Talence]], [[Gironde]]) is a [[France|French]] farmer, politician and [[syndicalism|syndicalist]], member of the [[alterglobalization|alter-globalization movement]], and spokesman for [[Via Campesina]]. He was one of the twelve official candidates in the [[2007 French presidential election]].<ref>{{cite news|title=No shocks as 12 candidates qualify for French vote|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUKL1961334520070319|work=Reuters|date=2007-03-20}}</ref> He served in the [[European Parliament]] as a member of the [[European Green Party|European Greens]] in the [[List of members of the European Parliament, 2009–14|2009-2014 term]], and also for the [[List of members of the European Parliament, 2014–2019|2014-2019 term]].

== Early life ==
[[Image:JoseBoveAtParis2005.jpg|thumb|left|José Bové (Paris, May 2005)]]

José Bové was born in [[Talence]], near [[Bordeaux]], but was raised in many different places. As a child he lived both inside and outside [[France]], including the [[United States]]. Bové speaks English fluently, as his parents moved with him to [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]], [[California]] when he was three. They were invited to be researchers at the [[University of California, Berkeley]].

After they returned to France, they lived in Paris. Bové attended a [[Jesuit]] secondary school near [[Paris]] (from which he was expelled for being "faithless"). While at university, he associated with anarchists and pacifists. When asked to serve in the army, he fled France.

== Anti-military activist ==

In 1976 Bové joined the [[Fight for the Larzac]], a movement protesting the proposed expansion of a [[military camp]] on the [[Larzac]] [[plateau]]. It would have displaced regional [[Sheep husbandry|sheep farmers]] and changed the ecology of the area. He joined a band of peasants occupying the threatened territory and illegally building a sheep [[barn]]. The protest eventually succeeded, and the government cancelled the military plan. As a result of that experience, Bové became a sheep farmer there, producing [[Roquefort|Roquefort cheese]].

== Agricultural unionist ==

Bové continued both as a farmer and an activist. In 1987, he formed the ''[[Confédération Paysanne]],'' an agricultural union. It promotes the quality of life for humans and the environment, promoting [[organic farming]].  In opposition to many companies in the profit-oriented agro-industry, Bové is a prominent opponent of [[genetically modified organism]]s (GMO).  In 1995 he joined [[Greenpeace]] on their ship, the ''[[Rainbow Warrior (1978)|Rainbow Warrior]],'' in a voyage to protest [[nuclear weapon]]s testing in the [[Pacific Ocean]]. He has also been part of the [[anarchist]] organization ''[[Alternative Libertaire]].''

Bové and the ''Confédération'' gained national and international attention in 1999 by dismantling a [[McDonald's]] franchise that was under construction in [[Millau]] ([[Aveyron]]).<ref name="notwelcome">{{cite web|url=http://www.thenation.com/article/jose-boves-not-welcome-bushs-usa/|title=Jose Bove's Not Welcome in Bush's USA |work=The Nation |date= |accessdate=2010-06-13}}</ref>  Considered by his supporters to be non-violent, Bové designed this protest against new US restrictions on importing Roquefort cheese and other products, which were harming the farmers who live from these products, and to raise awareness about McDonald's' use of hormone-treated beef. Bové was sentenced to three months' imprisonment for his role; he was imprisoned for 44 days and released early on 1 August 2002.

Later, the [[European Union]] imposed restrictions on importing hormone-treated beef (see [[Sanitary and Phytosanitary Agreement]]). However, the World Trade Organization, of which both the US and France are members, disallowed this restriction. After the EU refused to comply and remove the restrictions, the United States placed punitive tariffs on the importation of certain European goods, including [[Roquefort cheese]], in retaliation.

== Alter-globalization activist ==
[[Image:Jose Bove Salon Agriculture 2006.jpg|thumb|left|José Bové at an anti-GMO protest in March 2006]] 
During an interview by Lynn Jeffress for ''Z'' magazine in June 2001{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}, Bové explained why he destroyed the McDonald's, saying: "This is a fight against free trade global capitalism. It's about the logic of a certain economic system, not an American system. It can be a struggle against any country, this one or that one."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thirdworldtraveler.com/Reforming_System/World_Struggle_Underway.html|publisher=thirdworldtraveler.com |date= |accessdate=2001-06-13|title=A World Struggle Is Underway}}</ref>
Bové has participated in numerous [[anti-globalization]] movements. In June 1997 he took part in the first anti-GM mowing. The same year that he took part in destruction of the McDonald's, he attended the protests in [[Seattle]] against the [[World Trade Organization]] meeting. Bové became a figure of anti-globalization.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ecolopedia.fr/?p=1146|title=José Bové|website=www.ecolopedia.fr }}</ref>

Since then, he has redoubled his efforts in the world peasant and anti-globalization movements. He has said that he does not oppose the WTO and global rules,<ref>Jose Bove, ''Le monde n'est pas une marchandise''</ref>  and agrees there is a need for such forms. But his resistance, as stated by his followers, is directed against the lack of democracy in how these rules are developed, approved and implemented. Bové is a founding member of [[ATTAC]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.france.attac.org/le-coll-ge-des-fondateurs |title=ATTAC founding members |accessdate=2012-05-21 |language=fr |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110412031004/http://www.france.attac.org/le-coll-ge-des-fondateurs |archive-date=2011-04-12 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

In 2001 Bové took part in a major action destroying [[genetic engineering|genetically modified]] crops in [[Brazil]]. In 2005 he campaigned for a "No" vote in the French referendum on the [[EU Constitution]]; the proposal was defeated.

== Controversies ==

In April 2002 Bové was at the head of an activist group arriving in the [[West Bank]] to protest the massive Israeli Army operation ("[[Operation Defensive Shield]]" in official Israeli terminology) conducted at that time. It caused many Palestinian casualties. The group entered [[Yassir Arafat]]'s headquarters in [[Ramallah]], at the time besieged by Israeli forces. Bové joined with members of the newly established [[International Solidarity Movement]] ([[International Solidarity Movement|ISM]]), who were acting as "human shields" at the Palestinian Presidential Compound so as to deter the army from breaking in.

After spending a day in the besieged headquarters, Bové came out and was promptly arrested and deported by [[Israel]]i police. Upon his return to France, he was met by dozens of pro-Israeli and pro-Palestinian demonstrators, who scuffled briefly at Paris' Orly airport.

In an interview in 2002 with TV channel Canal Plus, Bové said he believed that the wave of attacks against French synagogues was being either arranged or fabricated by [[Mossad]] (the Israeli secret service). "Who profits from the crime?" Bové asked. "The Israeli government and its secret services have an interest in creating a certain psychosis, in making believe that there is a climate of antisemitism in France, in order to distract attention from what they are doing."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aijac.org.au/review/2002/276/france_antisem.html |title=("Liberte, Egalite, Judeophobie") |publisher=Aijac.org.au |accessdate=2010-06-13 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110516212717/http://www.aijac.org.au/review/2002/276/france_antisem.html |archivedate=2011-05-16 }}</ref> Considerable outrage was expressed after his remarks, and he later apologized for the statement.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lexpress.fr/actualite/economie/fin-de-campagne_490614.html |title=Fin de campagne |publisher=Lexpress.fr |date=2004-02-27 |accessdate=2010-06-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615005012/http://www.lexpress.fr/actualite/economie/fin-de-campagne_490614.html |archive-date=2011-06-15 |url-status=dead }}</ref> His visit to Arafat was denounced in a speech by the head of France's [[Conseil Représentatif des Institutions juives de France|CRIF]], an umbrella group for Jewish organisations.<ref>{{cite web|author=Reuters |url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/pages/ShArt.jhtml?itemNo=256708&contrassID=3&subContrassID=0&sbSubContrassID=0 |title=1 "Report of speech by Roger Cukierman, head of CRIF" |work= Haaretz.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-13}}</ref>

Bové has intervened to support the movements of the [[Tahiti]]ans and the [[Kanaks]], the indigenous [[Melanesia]]n people of [[New Caledonia]].  On 23 April 2004 he announced that he would join the [[People's Congress of Kurdistan]] (''Kongra-Gel''). This group has been classified as [[terrorist]] by both the European Union and the United States State Department.

== Civil disobedience ==

In 1976, Bové was sentenced and served three weeks of imprisonment for having destroyed documents belonging to the military, when opposing extension of [[Larzac]] military camp.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Biographie José Bové|url=http://www.lepoint.fr/content/presidentielle2007/article?id=113464|magazine=Le Point|language=fr|access-date=2007-03-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080104201005/http://www.lepoint.fr/content/presidentielle2007/article?id=113464|archive-date=2008-01-04|url-status=dead}}</ref>

In 2002, Bové was sentenced to three months' imprisonment for his role in the 1999 destruction of a McDonald's franchise in Millau, Aveyron. He served 44 days and was released on 1 August 2002.

On 22 June 2003 Bové began serving a sentence of ten months for the destruction of transgenic crops. [[ATTAC]] protested and called for him to be freed. A general pardon of prisoners issued for [[Bastille Day]], together with an individual action in his case by President [[Jacques Chirac]], reduced the sentence to seven months. Both supporters and opponents expressed dissatisfaction with the Presidential pardon, saying that it was entirely inadequate and wholly unjustified, respectively. On 15 November 2005 the [[Toulouse]] court of appeals sentenced Bové to 4 months in jail for having destroyed genetically engineered corn from a field. Other defendants, such as [[Noël Mamère]], got suspended sentences.<ref>{{cite web |author=e-TF1 |url=http://news.tf1.fr/news/france/0,,3263244,00.html |title=Infos en direct et en vidéo, l'actualité en temps réel - tf1.fr |publisher=News.tf1.fr |date= |accessdate=2010-06-13 }}{{Dead link|date=March 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

In February 2006, Bové was stopped at entry by [[U.S. Customs and Border Protection]] agents at New York's [[John F. Kennedy International Airport|JFK Airport]]. He was traveling to [[Cornell University]]'s School of Industrial and Labor Relations for events sponsored by Cornell's Global Labor Institute.  According to Bové, the Customs agents told him he was "ineligible" to enter the U.S. due to his past prosecutions for "moral crimes." After being detained for several hours, Bové was placed on an [[Air France]] flight to Paris.<ref name="notwelcome"/>

On 11 October 2016, Bové was denied entry to Canada because of his convictions related to protests, notably against McDonald's.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.lapresse.ca/actualites/201610/11/01-5029427-le-depute-europeen-jose-bove-interdit-dentrer-au-canada.php|title=Le député européen José Bové interdit d'entrer au Canada |first=Marie-Claude|last=Lortie|first2=Louis-Samuel|last2=Perron|newspaper=La Presse|language=fr-CA|access-date=12 October 2016}}</ref> He was subsequently allowed to stay in the country for seven days.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.lapresse.ca/actualites/201610/12/01-5029650-jose-bove-pourra-rester-au-canada-sept-jours.php|title=José Bové pourra rester au Canada sept jours |first=Julien|last=Arsenault|newspaper=La Presse|language=fr-CA|access-date=12 October 2016}}</ref>

== Political life ==
[[File:Jose Bove p1200239.jpg|thumb|15 April 2007 electoral meeting in [[Paris]]]]
Following an appeal from his supporters, who gathered 40,000 signatures, in January 2007 Bové announced he would run as a candidate that year in the [[2007 French presidential election]]. He formally declared on 1 February and in six weeks gained the required 500 signatures from elected officials necessary to be a candidate. He declared he was fighting for "the people that have no voice." He was trying to promote unity on the radical left and aiming to defeat the right and the far right, which had recently gained popularity. He was endorsed by actress [[Juliette Binoche]], who has international renown.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://fr.novopress.info/?p=7818 |title=Bobo-démago : Binoche aime Bové |date=April 6, 2007 |work=[[Novopress]] |agency=[[Rivarol (magazine)]] }}{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> On 19 March Bové announced that he had secured the support necessary to reach the second stage, to be listed on the published ballot, alongside 11 other contenders. On the first round of the presidential election, Bové scored 1.32% of the popular vote (483,008 votes).<ref>BBC News articles, 1 February and 19 March 2007</ref>

Following the French presidential elections, Bové became more closely associated with [[Europe Écologie]], a coalition of French environmentalist political parties including the [[The Greens (France)|Green Party]]. In the [[2009 European Parliament election]], he headed the list of candidates for the South-West constituency. On 7 June 2009 he was elected to the European Parliament, as Europe Ecologie garnered more than 16% of the vote in a [[proportional electoral system]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lejdd.fr/cmc/scanner/elections-europeennes-2009/200924/sud-ouest-jose-bove-elu_215943.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-06-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201232444/http://www.lejdd.fr/cmc/scanner/elections-europeennes-2009/200924/sud-ouest-jose-bove-elu_215943.html |archivedate=2014-02-01 }}</ref> He was re-elected at the [[2014 European Parliament election in France|2014 European Parliament election]].
