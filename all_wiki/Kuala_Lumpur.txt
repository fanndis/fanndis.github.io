===Etymology===
Kuala Lumpur means "muddy confluence" in Malay; ''kuala'' is the point where two rivers join together or an [[estuary]], and ''lumpur'' means "mud".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://glosbe.com/ms/en/kuala|title=kuala in English|work= Glosbe}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=9a02sRJKFhMC&pg=PA83|title=Malaysia, Singapore & Brunei.

It has also been proposed that Kuala Lumpur was originally named Pengkalan Lumpur ("muddy landing place") in the same way that [[Klang (city)|Klang]] was once called Pengkalan Batu ("stone landing place"), but became corrupted into Kuala Lumpur.<ref name="sutanpuasa"/> Another suggestion is that it was initially a Cantonese word ''lam-pa'' meaning 'flooded jungle' or 'decayed jungle'. There is no firm contemporary evidence for these suggestions other than anecdotes.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Story of Kuala Lumpur, 1857–1939|author=J.M. Gullick|publisher=Eastern Universities Press (M)|year=1983|isbn=978-967-908-028-5}}</ref> It is also possible that the name is a corrupted form of an earlier but now unidentifiable forgotten name.{{sfn|Gullick|1955|page=11}}

===Beginning of modern Kuala Lumpur===
[[File:Panorama of Kuala Lumpur ca. 1884.jpg|thumb|upright=1.7|left|Part of a panoramic view of Kuala Lumpur {{circa|1884}}. To the left is the [[Merdeka Square, Kuala Lumpur|Padang]]. The buildings were constructed of wood and atap before regulations were enacted by Swettenham in 1884 requiring buildings to use bricks and tiles. The appearance of Kuala Lumpur transformed rapidly and greatly in the following years.]]
Early Kuala Lumpur was a small town that suffered from many social and political problems – the buildings were made of wood and ''atap'' (palm frond [[thatching]]) that were prone to fire, lack of proper sanitation plagued the town with diseases, and it suffered from a constant threat of flooding. The town became embroiled in the [[Selangor Civil War]] due in part to the fight for control of revenues from the tin mines. The Chinese Kapitan Yap Ah Loy aligned himself with Tengku Kudin, and the rival Chinese gang allied themselves with Raja Mahdi.

The early Chinese and Malay settlements were along the east bank of the Klang River – the Chinese mainly settled around the commercial centre of Market Square; the Malays, later Indian [[Chettiar]]s and Indian Muslims resided in the Java Street (now [[Jalan Tun Perak]]) area. In 1880, the state capital of Selangor was moved from Klang to the more strategically advantageous Kuala Lumpur by the colonial administration, and the British Resident [[William Bloomfield Douglas]] then decided that the government buildings and living quarters should be located to the west of the river. Government offices and a new [[Royal Malaysia Police|police headquarters]] was built on Bukit Aman, and the Padang was created initially for police training.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Story of Kuala Lumpur, 1857–1939|author= J.M.

[[Frank Swettenham]], on becoming the British Resident, began improving the town by cleaning up the streets.

The development of [[Natural rubber|rubber]] industry in Selangor fueled by the demand for car tyre in the early 20th century led to a boom of the town, with the population of Kuala Lumpur increasing from 30,000 in 1900 to 80,000 in 1920.<ref name="gullick 3">{{cite book|title=The Story of Kuala Lumpur, 1857–1939|author= J.M.

During World War II, Kuala Lumpur was [[Battle of Kuala Lumpur|captured by the Imperial Japanese Army]] on 11 January 1942.

Historically Kuala Lumpur was a predominantly Chinese city, although more recently the Bumiputra component of the city has increased substantially and they are now the dominant group. The Kuala Lumpur of 1872 beside the Klang River was described by Frank Swettenham as a "purely Chinese village", although a Malay [[stockade]] already existed at [[Bukit Nanas]] at that time.<ref name="gulllick 3"/> By 1875, after the [[Selangor Civil War]] participated by Pahang Malays had ended, Swettenham noted Malay quarters near the Chinese area in a sketch map he had drawn, and there were said to be 1,000 Chinese and 700 Malays in the town in this period (many of the Malays may have settled in Kuala Lumpur after the war).<ref name="gulllick 3"/> The population of Kuala Lumpur had increased to around three thousand in 1880 when it was made the capital of Selangor.<ref name="population"/> A significant component of the Malay population in Kuala Lumpur of this period consisted of Malays recruited by the British in 1880 mostly from rural Malacca to establish a police force of 2–300, many of whom then brought their families here.{{sfn|Gullick|2000|page=43}} Many of the Malays were originally from the other islands of [[Malay Archipelago]] i.e. Sumatra and Java such as the [[Mandailing people|Mandailings]], the [[Minangkabau people|Minangkabaus]], [[Javanese people|Javanese]], and [[Bugis people|Buginese]] began arriving in Kuala Lumpur in the 19th century, while the [[Acehnese people|Acehnese]] arrived in the late 20th century.<ref>Antje Missbach, Separatist Conflict in Indonesia: The Long-distance Politics of the Acehnese Diaspora, 2011</ref> In the following decade which saw the rebuilding of the town it showed considerable increase with a large influx of immigrants, due in large part to the construction of a railway line in 1886 connecting Kuala Lumpur and [[Klang (city)|Klang]].<ref name=ooi/>

Prior to the Second World War, many [[shophouse]]s, usually two stories with functional shops on the ground floor and separate residential spaces upstairs, were built around the old city centre. These shop-houses drew inspiration from [[Straits Chinese]] and European traditions.<ref name="gurstien" /><ref name="gurstien google cache" /> Some of these shophouses have made way for new developments but there are still many standing today around Medan Pasar (Old Market Square), [[Petaling Street|Chinatown]], [[Jalan Tuanku Abdul Rahman]], Jalan Doraisamy, [[Bukit Bintang]] and Tengkat Tong Shin areas.

Independence coupled with the rapid economic growth from the 1970s to the 1990s and with Islam being the official religion in the country, has resulted in the construction of buildings with a more local and Islamic flavour arise around the city.

Like most other Asian cities, driving is the main mode of commuting in Kuala Lumpur.<ref name="prasarana" /> Hence, every part of the city is well connected by highways. As capital of [[Malaysia]], Kuala Lumpur has a comprehensive [[List of roads in Kuala Lumpur|road network]] with more transportation development are being planned and carried out.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dbkl.gov.my/pskl2020/english/transportation/|title=KL20 Transportation|publisher=Kuala Lumpur City Hall|access-date=6 April 2018}}</ref>

In terms of air connectivity, Kuala Lumpur is served by two airports. The main airport, [[Kuala Lumpur International Airport]] (KLIA) at Sepang, Selangor, which is also the aviation hub of Malaysia, is located about {{convert|50|km}} south of city. The other airport is [[Sultan Abdul Aziz Shah Airport]], also known as Subang Skypark and served as the main international gateway to Kuala Lumpur from 1965 until KLIA opened in 1998. KLIA connects the city with direct flights to destinations in six continents around the world,<ref>{{cite press release|publisher=National Geographic |url=http://www.ngcasia.com/press/megacities.aspx|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080206130643/http://www.ngcasia.com/press/megacities.aspx|archive-date=6 February 2008|title=Malaysia Airlines Takes Flight to MEGACITIES on National Geographic Channel|access-date=19 December 2007}}</ref> and is the main hub for the national carrier, [[Malaysia Airlines]] and low-cost carrier, [[AirAsia]]. KLIA can be reached using the [[KLIA Ekspres]], an [[airport rail link]] service from [[KL Sentral]], which takes twenty-eight&nbsp;minutes and costs [[Malaysian ringgit|RM]] 55 (roughly US$13.50),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kliaekspres.com/index3_klia_ekspres.html|title=KLIA Ekspres|publisher=Express Rail Link Sdn Bhd|access-date=13 December 2007 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071208182658/http://www.kliaekspres.com/index3_klia_ekspres.html |archive-date = 8 December 2007}}</ref> while travelling by car or bus via highway will take about an hour but cost a lot less. Direct buses from KLIA to the city centre are plentiful (every 10 to 15 minutes during peak hours), air-conditioned and comfortable with fares ranging from RM 11 (roughly US$2.70) to RM 15 (roughly US$3.70). Air Asia and other low-cost carrier flights do not fly out of KLIA main terminal but from [[KLIA2]] which is two kilometres from KLIA. KLIA2 is served by an extension of the KLIA Ekspres and by a free shuttle bus service from KLIA. {{as of|2018}}, Sultan Abdul Aziz Shah Airport is only used for chartered and turboprop flights by airlines such as [[Firefly (airline)|Firefly]] and [[Malindo Air]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.asianewsdesk.com/2007/11/27/subang-only-for-turbo-props/ |title=Subang only for turbo-props |publisher=Asian News Desk |date=27 November 2007 |access-date=13 December 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071218141156/http://www.asianewsdesk.com/2007/11/27/subang-only-for-turbo-props/ |archive-date=18 December 2007 }}</ref>
