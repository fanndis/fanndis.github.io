Ellison moved to Chicago's [[South Shore, Chicago|South Shore]], then a middle-class neighborhood. He remembers his adoptive mother as warm and loving, in contrast to his austere, unsupportive, and often distant adoptive father, who had chose  the name Ellison to honor his point of entry into the United States, [[Ellis Island]]. Louis Ellison was a government employee who had made a small fortune in Chicago real estate, only to lose it during the [[Great Depression]].<ref name=ell/>

Although Ellison was raised in a [[Reform Judaism|Reform Jewish]] home by his adoptive parents, who attended synagogue regularly, he remained a religious skeptic. Ellison states: "While I think I am religious in one sense, the particular dogmas of Judaism are not dogmas I subscribe to. I don't believe that they are real. They're interesting stories. They're interesting mythology, and I certainly respect people who believe these are literally true, but I don't. I see no evidence for this stuff." At age thirteen, Ellison refused to have a [[bar mitzvah]] celebration.<ref>Symonds and Ellison, [https://books.google.com/books?id=OOYb-0DNG18C&pg=PA110&lpg=PA110&dq=&source=bl&ots=fy6EWUqJSt&sig=pDxV5AhFxrOlLZygnCVz6bud0jI&hl=en&sa=X&ei=fYiAT5vsAufX0QHIjJmBCA&ved=0CFoQ6AEwCA%23v=onepage&q=jewish&f=false#v=snippet&q=jewish&f=false pp. 19–20] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160516193027/https://books.google.com/books?id=OOYb-0DNG18C&pg=PA110&lpg=PA110&dq=&source=bl&ots=fy6EWUqJSt&sig=pDxV5AhFxrOlLZygnCVz6bud0jI&hl=en&sa=X&ei=fYiAT5vsAufX0QHIjJmBCA&ved=0CFoQ6AEwCA%23v=onepage&q=jewish&f=false#v=snippet&q=jewish&f=false |date=May 16, 2016 }}.</ref> Ellison says that his fondness for Israel is not connected to religious sentiments, but rather due to the innovative spirit of Israelis in the technology sector.<ref>{{cite book |last= Symonds |first= Matthew |last2= Ellison |first2= Larry |title= Softwar: An Intimate Portrait of Larry Ellison and Oracle |date= 2003 |publisher= [[Simon & Schuster]] |location= New York |isbn= 9780743225052 |page= 389 |url= http://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Softwar/Matthew-Symonds/9780743225052 |access-date= December 31, 2016 |archive-date= December 31, 2016 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20161231170705/http://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Softwar/Matthew-Symonds/9780743225052 |url-status= live }}</ref>

==Early career and Oracle==
[[File:Larry Ellison in Oracle OpenWorld 2010.JPG|thumb|Larry Ellison lecturing at the [[Oracle OpenWorld]], San Francisco 2010]]
While working at [[Ampex]] in the early 1970s, he became influenced by [[Edgar F. Codd]]'s research on [[relational database]] design, which led in 1977 to the formation of what became Oracle. Oracle became a successful database vendor to mid- and low-range systems, later competing with [[Sybase]] (created 1984) and [[Microsoft SQL Server]] (a port of Sybase created in 1989) which led to Ellison being listed by ''Forbes'' as one of the richest men in the world.

=== 1977–1994 ===
During the 1970s, after a brief stint at [[Amdahl Corporation]], Ellison began working for [[Ampex Corporation]]. His projects included a [[database]] for the [[CIA]], which he named "Oracle". Ellison was inspired by a paper written by [[Edgar F. Codd]] on [[relational database management system|relational database systems]] called "A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks".<ref>{{cite journal |last= Codd |first= E. F. |title= A relational model of data for large shared data banks |journal=[[Communications of the ACM]] |date= June 1970 |volume= 13 |issue= 6 |pages= 377–387 |doi= 10.1145/362384.362685 }}</ref> In 1977, he founded Software Development Laboratories (SDL) with two partners and an investment of $2,000; $1,200 of the money was his.

In 1979, the company renamed itself Relational Software Inc., and in 1983, officially became Oracle Systems Corporation after its flagship product, the [[Oracle Database]]. Ellison had heard about the [[IBM System R]] database, also based on Codd's theories, and wanted Oracle to achieve compatibility with it, but IBM made this impossible by refusing to share System R's code. The initial release of Oracle in 1979 was called Oracle 2; there was no Oracle 1.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} In 1990, Oracle laid off 10% of its workforce (about 400 people) because it was losing money.<ref>{{cite web|title=Larry J. Ellison Biography and Interview|website=achievement.org|publisher=[[American Academy of Achievement]]|url=https://www.achievement.org/achiever/larry-j-ellison/#interview|access-date=April 12, 2019|archive-date=February 23, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190223071616/http://www.achievement.org/achiever/larry-j-ellison/#interview|url-status=live}}</ref> This crisis, which almost resulted in the company's bankruptcy, came about because of Oracle's "up-front" marketing strategy, in which sales people urged potential customers to buy the largest possible amount of software all at once. The sales people then booked the value of future license sales in the current quarter, thereby increasing their bonuses. This became a problem when the future sales subsequently failed to materialize. Oracle eventually had to restate its earnings twice, and had to settle [[class-action]] lawsuits arising from its having overstated its earnings. Ellison would later say that Oracle had made "an incredible business mistake".<ref>{{cite web |last= Gilbert |first= Alorie |title= Oracle cuts rewards for last-minute deals |url= https://www.cnet.com/uk/news/oracle-cuts-rewards-for-last-minute-deals/ |website= [[CNET]] |accessdate= December 31, 2016 |date= June 20, 2002 |df= mdy-all |archive-date= December 31, 2016 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20161231170721/https://www.cnet.com/uk/news/oracle-cuts-rewards-for-last-minute-deals/ |url-status= live }}</ref>

Although IBM dominated the mainframe relational database market with its [[IBM DB2|DB2]] and [[IBM SQL/DS|SQL/DS]] database products, it delayed entering the market for a relational database on [[Unix]] and [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] operating systems. This left the door open for [[Sybase]], Oracle, [[Informix Corporation|Informix]], and eventually [[Microsoft]] to dominate mid-range systems and microcomputers. Around this time, Oracle fell behind Sybase. From 1990 to 1993, Sybase was the fastest-growing database company and the database industry's darling vendor, but soon it fell victim to [[merger mania]]. Sybase's 1996 merger with Powersoft resulted in a loss of focus on its core database technology. In 1993, Sybase sold the rights to its database software running under the Windows operating system to Microsoft Corporation, which now markets it under the name "SQL Server".

In his early years at Oracle, Larry Ellison was named an Award Recipient in the High Technology Category for the [[Ernst and Young|EY]] Entrepreneur of the Year Program.<ref>{{cite news |first= Drake |last= Martinet |url= http://allthingsd.com/20110627/larry-ellison-has-one-and-now-11-more-entrepreneurs-do-too/ |title= Larry Ellison Has One, and Now 11 More Entrepreneurs Do, Too |publisher= [[All Things Digital]] |date= June 27, 2011 |access-date= April 13, 2015 |archive-date= July 3, 2011 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110703144153/http://allthingsd.com/20110627/larry-ellison-has-one-and-now-11-more-entrepreneurs-do-too/ |url-status= live }}</ref>

=== 1994–2010 ===
[[File:Larry Ellison on stage.jpg|thumb|left|Ellison in 2009]]
In 1994, Informix overtook Sybase and became Oracle's most important rival. The intense war between Informix CEO Phil White and Ellison was front-page Silicon Valley news for three years. In April 1997, Informix announced a major revenue shortfall and earnings restatements. Phil White eventually landed in jail, and [[IBM]] absorbed Informix in 2001. Also in 1997, Ellison was made a director of [[Apple Computer]] after [[Steve Jobs]] returned to the company. Ellison resigned in 2002. With the defeat of Informix and of Sybase, Oracle enjoyed years of industry dominance until the rise of Microsoft SQL Server in the late 1990s and IBM's acquisition of Informix Software in 2001 to complement their [[IBM DB2|DB2]] database. {{As of | 2013 }} Oracle's main competition for new database licenses on UNIX, [[Linux]], and Windows operating systems comes from IBM's DB2 and from Microsoft SQL Server. IBM's DB2 still dominates the [[Mainframe computer|mainframe]] database market.

In 2005, Oracle Corporation paid Ellison a $975,000 salary, a $6,500,000 bonus, and other compensation of $955,100.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/777676/000119312505177313/ddef14a.htm |title= Definitive Proxy Statement |publisher= [[Securities and Exchange Commission]] |accessdate= June 4, 2013 |archive-date= November 12, 2012 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20121112073954/http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/777676/000119312505177313/ddef14a.htm |url-status= live }}</ref> In 2007, Ellison earned a total compensation of $61,180,524, which included a base salary of $1,000,000, a cash bonus of $8,369,000, and options granted of $50,087,100.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.equilar.com/CEO_Compensation/ORACLE_CORP_Lawrence_J._Ellison.php |title= Executive Compensation: Lawrence J.

===Aviation===
Ellison is a licensed pilot who has owned several aircraft.<ref name=Rohrlich/> He was cited by the city of [[San Jose, California]], for violating its [[noise mitigation#Aircraft noise abatement|limits on late-night takeoffs and landings]] from [[San Jose Mineta International Airport]] by planes weighing more than 75,000&nbsp;pounds (34,019&nbsp;kg). In January 2000, Ellison sued over the interpretation of the airport rule, contending that his [[Gulfstream V]] aircraft "is certified by the manufacturer to fly at two weights: 75,000 pounds, and at 90,000 pounds for heavier loads or long flights requiring more fuel. But the pilot only lands the plane in San Jose when it weighs 75,000 pounds or less, and has the logs to prove it."<ref>{{cite news |first= Carolyne |last= Zinko |url= http://articles.sfgate.com/2000-01-07/news/17636763_1_airport-noise-curfew-hours-san-jose-international-airport |newspaper= [[San Francisco Chronicle]] |title= Ellison Sues Over Airport Rule on Noise at Night / He wants right to land his jet anytime |date= January 7, 2000 |accessdate= March 11, 2010 |archive-date= April 20, 2013 |archive-url= https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20130420095629/http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Ellison-Sues-Over-Airport-Rule-On-Noise-at-Night-2785281.php |url-status= live }}</ref> US District Judge [[Jeremy Fogel]] ruled in Ellison's favor in June 2001, calling for a waiver for Ellison's jet, but did not invalidate the curfew.<ref>{{cite news |first= Matthew B. |last= Stannard |url= http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2001/06/16/MNW222177.DTL |newspaper= [[San Francisco Chronicle]] |title= Judge clears Ellison for landing at night / Curfew left intact at San Jose airport |date= June 16, 2001 |accessdate= March 11, 2010 |archive-date= October 7, 2011 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20111007114546/http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=%2Fc%2Fa%2F2001%2F06%2F16%2FMNW222177.DTL |url-status= live }}</ref>

===Philanthropy===
In 1992 Ellison shattered his elbow in a high-speed bicycle crash. After receiving treatment at [[University of California, Davis]], Ellison donated $5&nbsp;million to seed the Lawrence J. Ellison Musculo-Skeletal Research Center. In 1998, the Lawrence J.

To settle an [[insider trading]] lawsuit arising from his selling nearly $1&nbsp;billion of Oracle stock, a court allowed Ellison to donate $100&nbsp;million to his own charitable foundation without admitting wrongdoing. A California judge refused to allow Oracle to pay Ellison's legal fees of $24&nbsp;million. Ellison's lawyer had argued that if Ellison were to pay the fees, that could be construed as an admission of guilt. His charitable donations to [[Stanford University]] raised questions about the independence of two Stanford professors who evaluated the case's merits for Oracle.<ref>In Re Oracle Corp.
