'''''Gaga''''' ('''gaga lipfern''') is a genus of 19 species of [[fern]]s in the family [[Pteridaceae]] named after American singer and songwriter [[Lady Gaga]]. Two of the 19 species are newly-[[species description|described]]—''[[Gaga germanotta]]'' from Costa Rica, named after the family of the singer (she was born Stefani Germanotta), and ''[[Gaga monstraparva]]'', in honor of Gaga's fans, whom she calls "little monsters". According to biologists, the ferns bear a close resemblance to Gaga's costume from the [[52nd Annual Grammy Awards]] and also bear a distinct DNA sequence spelling GAGA.

Except for the two new species, the rest of the ''Gaga'' ferns were reclassified, having previously been assigned to the genus ''[[Cheilanthes]]'', based on their outward appearance. Biologists at [[Duke University]] explained that they listed the ferns with the name ''Gaga'', due to the singer's active support of equality and individual expression. The decision received widespread attention from the science community and the media.

==Description==

Pryer published her findings in the then-current issue of ''[[Systematic Botany]]'', the quarterly publication of the American Society of Plant Taxonomists, after a five-year study of the ferns.<ref name="mtv"/> The 17 species were re-classified once Li was able to confirm by [[DNA sequencing]] of around 80 samples, that they were distinct in appearance and would be better categorized under a new genus. Pryer used new scientific tools for reorganization of the fern family tree. She also explained that the biology of the ''Gaga'' ferns are "exceptionally obscure" and unattainable due to the sexual crossing between the species. This was attained by their high content of [[chromosomes]] and [[asexuality]], which resulted in the child ferns being genetically identical to the parent ones, and thus indiscernible.<ref name="duke"/>

The genus is described as the early offshoot of hemionitid ferns, and is most closely related to genus ''[[Aspidotis]]''.<ref name="sys"/> Following the characteristics of most ferns, the ''Gaga'' group is homosporous in nature, and produce minute spherical spores that travel and fall down on the ground. They later germinate into heart-shaped [[gametophyte]]s. The thesis on the species explained that "These independent little organisms can be female, male or even bisexual, depending on growth conditions and what other kinds of gametophytes are around. When conditions are right, they exchange sperm between gametophytes, but when necessary they sometimes can also self-fertilize to produce a new fern."<ref name="duke"/>

|quote="We study, in particular, a group of ferns called the cheilanthoid ferns, there are about 500 or 600 of them, and many of them tend to be more adapted to living in desert situations, which is unusual for ferns... We've been doing a lot of molecular sequencing, looking at a lot of plant material, doing a lot of field work, so we're now at the point where we're concluding some of the work, and we have enough evidence to be able to look at all the data and say, 'Hmmm, there's this group here that is really in the wrong genus... We need to give it a new name'."

In September 2012, scientists at [[Chulalongkorn University]] had given Lady Gaga's name to a species of newly identified parasitic wasp, ''[[Aleiodes gaga]]''.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/sep/16/new-to-nature-aleiodes-gaga|title=New to Nature No 84: Aleiodes gaga|last=Wheeler|first=Quentin|date=September 15, 2012|work=The Guardian|access-date=August 11, 2017|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> A month later, researchers at [[Duke University]] in [[North Carolina]] discovered two new species of fern in Central and South America, Mexico, Arizona, and Texas.<ref name="guar">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/oct/24/lady-gaga-new-plant-named|title=Lady Gaga has new genus of plant named after her|last=Michaels|first=Sean|authorlink=Sean Michaels (writer)|date=October 12, 2012|accessdate=September 4, 2014|work=[[The Guardian]]}}</ref> They were named ''[[Gaga germanotta]]'', after the singer's family—she was born Stefani Germanotta—and ''[[Gaga monstraparva]]'', after a name for Gaga's fans, known as "little monsters".

Another 17 species of ferns had been assigned to the genus ''[[Cheilanthes]]'', but were reclassified under ''Gaga'', making a total of 19 species in the genus.<ref name="duke">{{cite web|url=http://today.duke.edu/2012/10/gagafern |title=Nineteen Species of Fern Named for Lady Gaga|publisher=[[Duke University]]|date=October 19, 2012|accessdate=October 30, 2012|last=Bates|first=Karl Leif}}</ref><ref name="sys">{{cite journal|url=https://pryerlab.biology.duke.edu/uploads/media_items/gaga-paper.original.pdf|author1=Li, Fay-Wei |author2=Pryer, Kathleen M. |author3=Windham, Michael D |format=PDF|title=''Gaga'', a New Fern Genus Segregated from ''Cheilanthes'' (Pteridaceae)|journal=[[Systematic Botany]]|publisher=[[American Society of Plant Taxonomists]]|volume=37|number=4|year=2012|pages=845–860|doi=10.1600/036364412X656626}}</ref>

According to Kathleen Pryer, president of the [[American Fern Society]], [[American Society of Plant Taxonomists]] and study leader of the research group, they often "listen[ed] to [Gaga's] music while we do our research... We think that her second album, ''[[Born This Way (album)|Born This Way]]'' (2011), is enormously empowering, especially for disenfranchised people and communities like LGBT, ethnic groups, women—and scientists who study odd ferns!" As the team started considering a name for the ferns, they noticed that one of them had the [[base pair]] sequence "G–A–G–A" ([[guanine]], [[adenine]], guanine, adenine)<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2012/10/lady-gaga-fern/|title=Lady Gaga Inspires Names of New Fern Species|last=Warr|first=Phillippa|date=October 24, 2012|accessdate=September 4, 2014|work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]}}</ref> in its DNA. This was noticed by one of the graduate students, Fay-Wei Li, who had scanned the base pairs and found the sequence.<ref name="duke"/> The ferns had the ability to self-fertilize and had "fluid definitions of gender". This gave the scientists concrete reason for naming the species as ''Gaga''.<ref name="guar"/>

The second inspiration came from Gaga's performance of "[[Poker Face (Lady Gaga song)|Poker Face]]" at the [[52nd Annual Grammy Awards]] in 2010. While singing, she had worn an [[Armani|Armani Prive']] costume, which was shaped like a heart. It was accompanied by huge shoulder pads, which gave it an appearance of the bisexual reproductive stage of the ferns, called a [[gametophyte]]. The dress also had the characteristic color of light green. Pryer noticed that the new leaves of the ferns were shaped like the characteristic "paws up" salute displayed by Gaga to her fans.<ref name="duke"/>

==Media reception==
The naming of the fern after the singer received widespread attention from the science community and the media. Duke University scholar and professor [[Cathy Davidson]], who had been previously associated with the inception of Gaga's [[Born This Way Foundation]], said that it was a "remarkable, unexpected, perfect tribute to name a genus of ferns for Lady Gaga".<ref name="duke"/> Amy Briggs from ''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]'' added that along with her "dance tunes and memorable meaty fashion choices, [Gaga] has another claim to fame: botany."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://newswatch.nationalgeographic.com/2012/10/25/19-ferns-go-gaga/|title=19 Ferns Go Gaga!|last=Briggs|first=Amy|date=October 25, 2012|accessdate=September 8, 2014|work=[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]}}</ref> [[Sean Michaels (writer)|Sean Michaels]] from ''[[The Guardian]]'' remarked that "by honoring Gaga in this way, the academics have doubtless paved the way for a series of fern-based costumes".<ref name="guar"/> [[David Itzkoff]] from ''[[The New York Times]]'' declared about the naming, "scientists may seem like a pretty poker-faced bunch, but the botanists at Duke University, at least, have a sense of humor about their work and some pop-culture savvy to go with it".<ref name="nyt">{{cite news|url=http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/23/germinated-this-way-new-fern-species-named-after-lady-gaga/|title=Germinated This Way: New Fern Species Named After Lady Gaga|first=David |last=Itzkoff|authorlink=David Itzkoff|date=October 23, 2012|accessdate=September 4, 2014|work=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref> James Montgomery from [[MTV News]] noted that Gaga is characterized as a "global superstar, fashion icon, entrepreneur and role model to millions, yet despite all that, her impact on the world of pteridophytes has been minimal at best&nbsp;— until now, that is [with the naming]."<ref name="mtv">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1696098/lady-gaga-fern/|title=Lady Gaga-Inspired Botanist Says New Ferns 'Celebrate Diversity'|last=Montgomery|first=James|date=October 23, 2012|accessdate=September 5, 2014|work=[[MTV News]].
