The '''''Evening Standard''''' (also the '''''London Evening Standard''''') is a local [[free daily newspaper]], published Monday to Friday in [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] format in London. Since 2009 it has been owned by Russian businessman [[Alexander Lebedev]]. It is the dominant local/regional evening paper for London and the surrounding area, with coverage of national and international news and [[City of London]] finance. Its current editor is [[Emily Sheffield]]. In October 2009, the paper ended a 180-year history of [[Newspaper circulation|paid circulation]] and became a free newspaper, doubling its circulation as part of a change in its business plan.<ref name=eandp09>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.editorandpublisher.com/eandp/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1004018125|title=London's 'Evening Standard' To Become Free Paper|magazine=[[Editor & Publisher]]|date=2 October 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091004161745/http://www.editorandpublisher.com/eandp/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1004018125|archivedate=4 October 2009}}</ref>

== History ==
=== From 1827 to 2009 ===
The newspaper was founded by barrister [[Stanley Lees Giffard]] on 21 May 1827 as ''The Standard''.<ref name=history>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/jan/14/history-london-evening-standard|title=A history of the London Evening Standard: seeing off rivals for 181 years|newspaper=The Guardian|date=14 January 2009|author=Stephen Brook|accessdate=24 November 2018}}</ref> The early owner of the paper was Charles Baldwin. Under the ownership of [[James Johnstone (publisher)|James Johnstone]], ''The Standard'' became a morning paper from 29 June 1857. ''The Evening Standard'' was published from 11 June 1859. ''The Standard'' gained eminence for its detailed foreign news, notably its reporting of events of the [[American Civil War]] (1861–1865), the [[Austro-Prussian War]] of 1866, and the [[Franco-Prussian War]] of 1870, all contributing to a rise in circulation.<ref>''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' Eleventh Edition; Cambridge University Press, 1911, Vol. XIX, Mun to Oddfellows; Article on Newspapers, pp. 544–581.</ref> By the end of the 19th century, the evening edition eclipsed its morning counterpart.

Both ''The Standard'' and the ''Evening Standard'' were acquired by <!-- Not a baronet until 1916. -->[[Sir Arthur Pearson, 1st Baronet|C. Arthur Pearson]] in 1904.<ref name=Griffiths234>{{cite book|last=Griffiths|first=Dennis|title=The Encyclopedia of the British Press, 1422–1992|publisher=Macmillan|year=1992|page=234|location=London & Basingstoke|isbn=9780333529843|edition=illustrated}}</ref> In May 1915, <!-- Not a baronet until 1921. -->[[Sir Edward Hulton, 1st Baronet|Edward Hulton]] purchased the ''Evening Standard'' from [[Davison Dalziel, 1st Baron Dalziel of Wooler|Davison Dalziel]].<ref>Griffiths, ''Encyclopedia of the British Press'', p. 324</ref> Dalziel had purchased both papers in 1910,<ref>Griffiths, ''Encyclopedia of the British Press'',  p.188</ref> and closed ''The Standard'', the morning paper, in 1916.<ref name=Griffiths234/> Hulton introduced the gossip column ''Londoner's Diary'', originally billed as "a column written by gentlemen for gentlemen".

In 1923, [[Max Aitken, 1st Baron Beaverbrook|Lord Beaverbrook]], owner of the ''[[Daily Express]]'', bought Hulton's newspapers, although he sold them shortly thereafter to the ''[[Daily Mail]]''{{'}}s owner Lord Rothermere, with the exception of the ''Standard''. It became a staunchly Conservative paper, harshly attacking Labour in 1945 in a high-profile campaign that backfired. In the 1960s, the paper was upstaged by ''[[The Evening News (London newspaper)|The Evening News]]'', which sold over 1&nbsp;million copies nightly. During the decade, the paper also began to publish the comic strip ''[[Modesty Blaise]]'', which bolstered its sales throughout the 1970s. ''The Evening Standard'' ceased publishing on Saturdays on 30 Nov 1974, when it still produced six editions daily.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://47shoelane.wordpress.com/galleries/terriboules|title=Where are they now, those Saturday People?|website=47shoelane|date=1 November 2015}}</ref>

In 1980, [[Express Newspapers]] merged the ''Standard'' with [[Associated Newspapers]]' ''[[Evening News (London)|Evening News]]'' in a [[Joint Operating Agreement]]. The new paper was known as the ''New Standard'' until 1985, when Associated Newspapers bought out the remaining stake, turning it into ''The Standard''. In 1987 the ''Evening News'' was briefly revived to compete with Robert Maxwell's ''[[London Daily News]]'', but was reabsorbed into ''The Standard'' later that year, after the collapse of Maxwell's paper. In 1988 the ''Evening Standard'' included the by-line "Incorporating the 'Evening News'", which remained until the paper's sale in 2009.

=== Lebedev takeover ===
On 21 January 2009, the Russian businessman and former [[KGB]] agent [[Alexander Lebedev]] and his son [[Evgeny Lebedev]], owners of ''[[The Independent]]'', agreed to purchase control of the newspaper at £1 for 64 percent ownership.<ref name=Lebedev/><ref name=BBC>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7841891.stm|title=Ex-KGB Spy Buys UK Paper for £1|work=BBC News|date=21 January 2009|accessdate=21 January 2009}}</ref> A few years earlier, 12 percent of the paper was sold to Justin Shaw and Geordie Greig. Associated News keeps the remaining 24 percent.

In November 2009, it was announced that the ''London Evening Standard'' would drop its midday "News Extra" edition from 4 January 2010 with the first edition being the West End Final, available from 2&nbsp;pm.<ref name=G26N09>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/nov/26/london-evening-standard-drops-edition|title=London Evening Standard Drops Noon Edition and Cuts Jobs|newspaper=The Guardian|date=26 November 2009|author=Mark Sweney|accessdate=31 March 2012|location=London}}</ref> One edition of 600,000 copies would be printed starting at 12:30&nbsp;pm, ending 3&nbsp;am starts for journalists and the previous deadline of 9&nbsp;am for the first edition; twenty people were expected to lose their jobs as a result.<ref name=G26N09/>

Previously there were three editions each weekday, excluding [[Bank holiday]]s. The first, "News Extra", went to print at 10:00&nbsp;am and was available around 11&nbsp;am in central London, slightly later in more outlying areas (such as Kent). A second edition, "West End Final", went to print at 3&nbsp;pm, and the "Late Night Final" went to print at 5&nbsp;pm and was available in the central area from about 6&nbsp;pm. There was often considerable variation between the editions, particularly with the front-page lead and following few pages, including the [[Londoner's Diary]], though features and reviews stayed the same.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.magforum.com/papers/nationals.htm#eve|title=ESI Media (Independent, Standard)|website=MagForum|accessdate=24 November 2018}}</ref> In January 2010, circulation was increased to 900,000.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/jul/10/london-evening-standard-plan-circulation-increase|title=London Evening Standard owner plots circulation increase to 900,000 copies|newspaper=The Guardian|date=10 July 2013|author=John Reynolds|accessdate=24 November 2018}}</ref>

=== May 2009 relaunch ===
[[File:London Evening Standard dispensers, Sainsburys.jpg|thumb|''London Evening Standard'' dispensers at Sainsbury's supermarket, 2017]]
In May 2009, the newspaper launched a series of poster ads, each of which prominently featured the word "Sorry" in the paper's then-masthead font. These ads offered various apologies for past editorial approaches, such as "Sorry for losing touch".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2009/may/04/london-evening-standard-alexander-lebedev|title=Evening Standard Launches Ad Campaign To Say Sorry to Londoners|work=Greenslade Blog|via=The Guardian|date=4 May 2009|author=[[Roy Greenslade]]|accessdate=4 August 2012}}</ref> None of the posters mentioned the ''Evening Standard'' by name, although they featured the paper's [[Eros]] logo. Ex-editor [[Veronica Wadley]] criticised the "Pravda-style" campaign saying it humiliated the paper's staff and insulted its readers.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.brandrepublic.com/News/904743/Ex-editor-Wadley-criticises-Standards-Pravda-style-relaunch/|title=Ex-Editor Wadley Criticises Standard's 'Pravda-Style' Relaunch|publisher=[[Brand Republic]]|date=11 May 2009}}</ref> The campaign was designed by [[McCann Erickson]]. Also in May 2009 the paper relaunched as the ''London Evening Standard'' with a new layout and masthead, marking the occasion by giving away 650,000 free copies on the day,<ref>{{cite web|title=London Evening Standard Relaunch – Who's Sorry Now?|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/organgrinder/2009/may/11/london-evening-standard-local-newspapers|work=Organ Grinder Blog|via=The Guardian|date=11 May 2009|author=Stephen Brook|accessdate=4 August 2012}}</ref> and refreshed its sports coverage.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/may/27/london-evening-standard-pressandpublishing|title=London Evening Standard Revamps Sport Pages|newspaper=The Guardian|date=27 May 2009|author=Stephen Brook|accessdate=31 March 2012|location=London}}</ref>

=== October 2009: freesheet ===
After a long history of paid circulation, on 12 October 2009 the ''Standard'' became a free newspaper,<ref name=eandp09/><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/8286660.stm|title=Evening Standard To Be Free Paper|work=BBC News|date=2 October 2009}}</ref> with free circulation of 700,000, limited to central London. In February 2010, a paid-for circulation version became available in suburban areas of London for 20p (although many places sell it for 50p).<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2010/feb/15/london-evening-standard-free-not|title=How Much for a 'Free' London Evening Standard? 50p in Some Shops|work=Greenslade Blog|via=The Guardian|date=15 February 2010|author=Steve Busfield|accessdate=4 August 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://londonist.com/2010/02/evening_standard_no_longer_free_in|title=Evening Standard No Longer Free In Some Parts|publisher=[[Londonist]]|date=15 February 2010}}</ref> The newspaper won the ''Media Brand of the Year'' and the ''Grand Prix Gold'' awards at the Media Week awards in October 2010. The judges said, "[the Standard has] quite simply ... stunned the market. Not just for the act of going free, but because editorial quality has been maintained, circulation has almost trebled and advertisers have responded favourably. Here is a media brand restored to health."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/press/evening-standard-wins-top-awards-2120509.html|title='Evening Standard' Wins Top Awards|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|date=30 October 2010|accessdate=30 October 2010|publisher=ESI Media}}</ref> The ''Standard'' also won the daily newspaper of the year award at the London Press Club Press Awards in May 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=1&storycode=47098|title=Evening Standard Wins Newspaper of the Year Award|work=[[Press Gazette]]|date=15 May 2011|accessdate=15 May 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112115604/http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=1&storycode=47098|archivedate=12 January 2012}}</ref>

''The Evening Standard'' launched a mobile app with US app developer [[Handmark]] in May 2010.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/may/24/london-evening-standard-smartphone-app|title=London Evening Standard launches smartphone app|newspaper=The Guardian|date=24 April 2010|author=Jason Deans|accessdate=11 October 2018}}</ref> The range of apps was updated in 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.newsworks.org.uk/News-and-Opinion/evening-standard-launches-new-app-range |title=Evening Standard launches new app range|publisher=Newsworks|date=15 January 2015|author=Jessie Sampson|accessdate=11 October 2018}}</ref>

=== March 2018: redesign ===
In March 2018, editor [[George Osborne]] initiated a redesign of the paper, which featured a dropping of the 'London' from the paper's title in a signal of the paper's ambition to have greater national and international influence.<ref name=thedrum1>{{cite web|url=https://www.thedrum.com/opinion/2018/03/12/george-osborne-his-evening-standard-revamp-and-dropping-london-its-masthead|title=George Osborne on his Evening Standard revamp and dropping London from its masthead|publisher=The Drum|date=12 March 2018|author=Ian Burrell|accessdate=27 March 2018}}</ref> The paper also introduced more colourful "sign-posting" for different sections such as news, comment, and business, as it was noted by Osborne that it had not been "easy" to find them inside the paper previously.<ref name=thedrum1/> The masthead was also redesigned with a new font, and emojis were added to the paper's five-day weather forecast.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/evening-standard-redesign-weather-poo-emojis-no-more-london-in-masthead-and-pink-business-pages/|title=Evening Standard redesign: Weather 'poo' emojis, no more 'London' in masthead and pink business pages|publisher=PressGazette.co.uk|date=12 March 2018|author=Freddy Mayhew|accessdate=27 March 2018}}</ref>

=== May 2018: financial sponsorship ===
In May 2018, James Cusick of [[openDemocracy]] alleged the newspaper had been providing favourable news coverage to companies including Uber and Google in exchange for financial sponsorship.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.opendemocracy.net/uk/james-cusick/george-osborne-s-london-evening-standard-promises-positive-news-coverage-to-uber-goo|title=George Osborne's London Evening Standard sells its editorial independence to Uber, Google and others – for £3 million|publisher=openDemocracy|date=30 May 2018|author=James Cusick}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://theconversation.com/fake-news-week-three-stories-that-reveal-the-extreme-pressure-journalism-is-now-under-97568|title=Fake news week: three stories that reveal the extreme pressure journalism is now under|work=The Conversation|date=1 June 2018|author=Richard Sambrook}}</ref>

=== 2019 and 2020 redundancies ===

In June 2019, the ''Evening Standard'' announced job cuts.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pressgazette.co.uk/evening-standard-theatre-reviewers-axed-cost-cutting/|title=Evening Standard theatre critics axed as part of 'necessary cost-cutting'|date=4 June 2019|website=Press Gazette}}</ref> By the end of 2019, the company reported a pre-tax loss of £13.6 million.

== Editorial style ==
Since July 2020 the newspaper's editor is [[Emily Sheffield]], sister of [[Samantha Cameron]], who took over from the former [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] [[George Osborne]], who has now taken over the role of editor-in-chief. As editor he had replaced [[Sarah Sands]] who, in turn, had replaced [[Geordie Greig]] following his departure to ''[[The Mail on Sunday]]'' in March 2012.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/mar/30/sarah-sands-editor-evening-standard|title=Sarah Sands Is New Editor of London Evening Standard|newspaper=The Guardian|date=30 March 2012|author=Dan Sabbagh|accessdate=31 March 2012}}</ref> [[Veronica Wadley]] was the newspaper's editor between 2002 and 2009.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/may/11/veronica-wadley-london-evening-standard|title=Ex-Evening Standard Editor Veronica Wadley's Verdict on Paper's New Regime|newspaper=The Guardian|date=11 May 2009|author=Veronica Wadley|accessdate=31 March 2012}}</ref> [[Max Hastings]] was editor from 1996 until he retired in 2002.

''The London Evening Standard'', although a regional newspaper, does cover national and international news, though with an emphasis on London-centred news (especially in its features pages), covering building developments, property prices, traffic schemes, politics, the congestion charge and, in the ''[[Londoner's Diary]]'' page, gossip on the social scene. It also occasionally runs campaigns on local issues that national newspapers do not cover in detail.

It has a tradition of providing arts coverage. Its best known former art critic, [[Brian Sewell]], was known for his acerbic view of [[conceptual art]], [[Young British Artists|Britart]] and the [[Turner Prize]]<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/culturenews/6672066/Tates-collections-wretched-says-Brian-Sewell.html|title=Tate's collections 'wretched', says Brian Sewell|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=30 November 2009}}</ref> and his views attracted controversy and criticism in the art world.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/sep/20/brian-sewells-pungent-views-got-people-arguing-thats-what-matters|title=Brian Sewell's pungent views got people arguing – that's what matters|newspaper=The Guardian|date=20 September 2015|author=Jonathan Jones|accessdate=4 November 2018}}</ref> He has been described as "Britain's most famous and controversial art critic".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2005/nov/13/art|title=We pee on things and call it art|newspaper=The Guardian|date=13 November 2005|author=Rachel Cooke|accessdate=30 November 2008}}</ref>

;2008 London mayoral election
During the [[2008 London mayoral election]] the newspaper – and particularly the correspondent [[Andrew Gilligan]] – published articles in support of the Conservative candidate, [[Boris Johnson]], including frequent front-page headlines condemning [[Ken Livingstone]]. This included the headline "Suicide bomb backer runs Ken's campaign".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2008/apr/16/michaelwhitespoliticalblog131|title=As Polls Move Towards Ken, Evening Standard Seems Rattled|newspaper=The Guardian|date=16 April 2008|author=Michael White|accessdate=27 April 2009}}</ref>

;2016 London mayoral election
A study conducted by the Media Reform Coalition (MRC) and [[Goldsmiths University of London]] argued that in [[2016 London mayoral election|the 2016 elections]] for the new [[Mayor of London]], the ''London Evening Standard'' was the "mouthpiece of the Conservative Party", according to MRC chair Justin Schlosberg. There were almost twice as many positive headlines about the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] candidate, [[Zac Goldsmith]], as for his Labour rival, [[Sadiq Khan]], with stories exhibiting the strongest bias against Khan also being the most prominent. 13 out of 15 official press releases from the Goldsmith campaign in the two months to 12 April were published as news stories in the paper, "reproducing headlines from the news release virtually verbatim", according to the study.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/apr/27/london-evening-standard-tory-mouthpiece-zac-goldsmith|title=London Evening Standard is 'Tory mouthpiece' – research|newspaper=The Guardian|date=27 April 2016|author=Jane Martinson|accessdate=27 April 2016}}</ref>

== Freesheet and supplements ==
[[File:Evening Standard Van.jpg|thumb|200px|''The Evening Standard'' has a fleet of delivery vans painted in a distinctive orange and white livery.]]

On 14 December 2004, [[Associated Newspapers]] launched a Monday–Friday [[Free daily newspaper|freesheet]] edition of the ''Evening Standard'' called ''[[Standard Lite]]'' to help boost circulation. This had 48 pages, compared with about 80 in the main paper, which also had a supplement on most days.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2004/dec/10/pressandpublishing.advertising|title=Media buyers voice fears over 'downmarket' free Standard|newspaper=The Guardian|date=10 December 2004|author=Claire Cozens|accessdate=1 June 2015}}</ref>

In August 2006, the freesheet was relaunched as ''[[London Lite]]''. It was designed to be especially attractive to younger female readers and featured a wide range of lifestyle articles, but less news and business news than the main paper. It was initially only available between 11.30&nbsp;a.m. and 2.30&nbsp;p.m. at ''Evening Standard'' vendors and in the central area, but later became available in the evening from its street distributors.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2006/aug/25/associatednewspapers.pressandpublishing2|title=Some Lite relief|newspaper=The Guardian|date=25 August 2006|author=Stephen Brook|accessdate=1 June 2015}}</ref> With the sale of the ''Evening Standard'', but not the ''London Lite'', to Alexander Lebedev on 21 January 2009, the ownership links between the ''Standard'' and the ''Lite'' were broken.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/oct/05/associated-newspapers-evening-standard|title=Associated Newspapers backs Evening Standard decision to go free|newspaper=The Guardian|date=5 October 2009|author=Stephen Brook}}</ref>

On Fridays, the newspaper includes a free glossy lifestyle magazine, ''ES'' (launched as the ''Evening Standard Magazine'' in 2009<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.magforum.com/papers/nationals.htm#ass|title=UK national newspapers|website=MagForum|accessdate=9 June 2018}}</ref>), and the circulation was increased to 350,000 in September 2014. This has moved from more general articles to concentrate on glamour, with features on the rich, powerful and famous. On Wednesdays, selected areas offer a free copy of the ''Homes & Property'' supplement, edited by Janice Morley, which includes London property listings as well as articles from lifestyle journalists including Barbara Chandler, Katie Law, and [[Alison Cork]].

An entertainment guide supplement ''Metro Life'' (previously called ''Hot Tickets'') was launched in September 2002. This was a what's-on guide with listings of cinemas and theatres in and around London and was given away on Thursdays. It was discontinued on 1 September 2005.

The paper also supplies occasional CDs and DVDs for promotions. It also gives Londoners a chance to win exclusive tickets to film premieres and sports tournament tickets, such as the [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]] Ladies Singles Final.

The newspaper's ''This Is London'' website carries some of the stories from the ''Evening Standard'' and promotions, reviews and competitions. It also includes a number of blogs by ''Evening Standard'' writers, such as restaurant critic [[Charles Campion]], theatre critic [[Kieron Quirke]] and music critic David Smyth. A separate website contains images of each page of the print edition (two versions) and supplements.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.standard.co.uk/author/this-is-london|title=This is London|website=Evening Standard}}</ref>
