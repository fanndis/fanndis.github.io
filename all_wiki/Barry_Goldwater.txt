'''Barry Morris Goldwater''' (January 2, 1909<ref>Internet Accuracy Project, [http://www.accuracyproject.org/cbe-Goldwater,Barry.html Senator Barry Goldwater]. Retrieved September 23, 2010.</ref> – May 29, 1998) was an American politician, businessman, and author who was a five-term [[United States Senate|Senator]] from [[Arizona]] (1953–1965, 1969–1987) and the [[History of the United States Republican Party|Republican Party]] nominee for [[president of the United States]] in 1964. Despite his loss of the [[1964 United States presidential election|1964 presidential election]] in a landslide, Goldwater is the politician most often credited with having sparked the resurgence of the [[Conservatism in the United States|American conservative]] political movement in the 1960s. He also had a substantial impact on the [[Libertarianism in the United States|libertarian movement]].<ref>{{Citation | first = Robert | last = Poole | url = http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1568/is_n4_v30/ai_20954419 | title = In memoriam: Barry Goldwater | type = Obituary | newspaper = [[Reason (magazine)|Reason]] |date=August–September 1998| archive-url = http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090628123204/http%3A//findarticles%2Ecom/p/articles/mi_m1568/is_n4_v30/ai_20954419/| archive-date = June 28, 2009}}</ref>

Johnson]] by one of the largest margin in history. Goldwater returned to the Senate in 1969 and specialized in defense and foreign policy. As an elder statesman of the party, Goldwater successfully urged President [[Richard Nixon]] to resign in 1974 when evidence of a cover-up in the [[Watergate scandal]] became overwhelming and [[Impeachment in the United States#Federal impeachment|impeachment]] was imminent.

Goldwater narrowly won re-election in 1980 for what would be his final and most influential term in the senate. In 1986, Goldwater oversaw passage of the [[Goldwater–Nichols Act]], arguably his most significant legislative achievement. The following year, he retired from the Senate and was succeeded by [[John McCain]], who praised his predecessor as the man who "transformed the Republican Party from an Eastern elitist organization to the breeding ground for the election of Ronald Reagan". Goldwater strongly supported the [[Ronald Reagan 1980 presidential campaign|1980 presidential campaign of Reagan]], who had become the standard-bearer of the conservative movement after his "[[A Time for Choosing]]" speech. Reagan reflected many of the principles of Goldwater's earlier run in his campaign. ''[[The Washington Post]]'' columnist [[George Will]] took note of this, writing: "We [...] who voted for him in 1964 believe he won, it just took 16 years to count the votes".

Goldwater's views grew increasingly libertarian as he neared the end of his career. After leaving the Senate, Goldwater's views cemented as libertarian. He criticized the "moneymaking ventures by fellows like [[Pat Robertson]] and others [in the Republican Party] who are trying to...make a religious organization out of it." He lobbied for [[Sexual orientation and gender identity in military service|homosexuals to be able to serve openly in the military]], opposed the [[Clinton administration]]'s plan for health care reform, and supported [[Abortion in the United States|abortion rights]] and the legalization of [[Medical cannabis in the United States|medicinal marijuana]]. 

In 1997, Goldwater was revealed to be in the early stages of [[Alzheimer's disease]]. He died a year later at the age of 89.

== Personal life ==
Goldwater was born in [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] in what was then the [[Arizona Territory]], the son of Baron M. Goldwater and his wife, Hattie Josephine "JoJo" Williams. His father's family had founded [[Goldwater's|Goldwater’s Department Store]], a leading upscale [[department store]] in Phoenix.<ref>{{cite book|author=Kathleen Garcia|title=Early Phoenix|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F25aMroD_IUC&pg=PA62|year=2008|publisher=Arcadia Publishing|page=62|isbn=978-0738548395}}</ref> Goldwater's paternal grandfather, Michel Goldwasser, a [[History of the Jews in Poland|Polish Jew]], was born in 1821 in [[Konin]], then part of [[Congress Poland]], whence he emigrated to London following the [[Revolutions of 1848]]. Soon after arriving in London, he anglicized his name from Goldwasser to Goldwater. Michel married Sarah Nathan, a member of an [[History of the Jews in England|English-Jewish]] family, in the [[Great Synagogue of London]].<ref>{{cite web| first = George | last = Zornik | url = http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-1284836.html | title =Thoroughly modern grandmothers |publisher=High beam | access-date=March 3, 2012| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130430215538/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-1284836.html | archive-date=April 30, 2013 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/books/chap1/barrygoldwater.htm | work=The Washington Post | date=May 13, 1997 | access-date=March 30, 2010 | title= Barry Goldwater}}</ref>

After he did poorly as a freshman in high school, Goldwater's parents sent him to [[Staunton Military Academy]] in Virginia where he played varsity football, basketball, track and swimming, was senior class treasurer  and attained the rank of captain.<ref name="NYTObit" /><ref name="StauntonMilitary">{{cite book|last=Malakoff|first=L.E.|title=Blue & Gold Yearbook|publisher=Staunton Military Academy|year=1928|url=http://smahistory.com/smayearbooks/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/1928.pdf|access-date=April 19, 2019}}</ref> He graduated from the academy in 1928 and enrolled at the [[University of Arizona]].<ref name="StauntonMilitary" /><ref>{{Biographical Directory of Congress|G000267|inline=yes}}</ref> Goldwater dropped out of college after one year.

Goldwater entered the family's business around the time of his father's death in 1930. Six years later, he took over the department store, though he was not particularly enthused about running the business.<ref name="NYTObit" />

=== Family ===
In 1934, he married Margaret "Peggy" Johnson, daughter of a prominent industrialist from [[Muncie, Indiana]]. They had four children: Joanne (born January 18, 1936), [[Barry Goldwater Jr.|Barry]] (born July 15, 1938), Michael (born March 15, 1940), and Peggy (born July 27, 1944). Goldwater became a widower in 1985, and in 1992 he married Susan Wechsler, a nurse 32 years his junior.{{Sfn | Goldberg | 1995 |pp=41–42, 48–49, 326, 332}}

Goldwater's son [[Barry Goldwater Jr.]] served as a [[United States House of Representatives]] member from California from 1969 to 1983.

Goldwater's uncle [[Morris Goldwater]] (1852–1939) was an Arizona territorial and state legislator, mayor of [[Prescott, Arizona]], and a businessman.<ref>'State Mourns Death of Morris Goldwater,' ''The Arizona Republic,'' April 12, 1939, p. 1</ref>

Goldwater's grandson Ty Ross, a former [[Zoli Agency|Zoli]] model, is openly gay and HIV positive, and the one who inspired the elder Goldwater "to become an octogenarian proponent of gay civil rights".<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Rich|first1=Frank|title=Journal; The Right Stuff|journal=The New York Times|year=1998|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/06/03/opinion/journal-the-right-stuff.html}}</ref>

=== Military career ===
[[File:Major General Barry M. Goldwater (USAFR).jpg|left|thumb|218x218px|Major General Barry M. Goldwater in his [[United States Air Force]] uniform.]]With the American entry into [[World War II]], Goldwater received a reserve commission in the [[United States Army Air Forces]]. He became a pilot assigned to the Ferry Command, a newly formed unit that flew aircraft and supplies to war zones worldwide. He spent most of the war flying between the U.S. and [[India]], via the [[Azores]] and North Africa or South America, [[Nigeria]], and Central Africa. He also flew "the hump" over the [[Himalayas]] to deliver supplies to the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]].

Following World War II, Goldwater was a leading proponent of creating the [[United States Air Force Academy]], and later served on the Academy's Board of Visitors. The visitor center at the Academy is now named in his honor. As a colonel he also founded the [[Arizona Air National Guard]], and he [[desegregate]]d it two years before the rest of the U.S. military. Goldwater was instrumental in pushing the Pentagon to support desegregation of the armed services.<ref>{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=-EgEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA93&q=goldwater%20and%20the%20desegregation%20of%20the%20arizona%20air%20national%20guard | contribution =Life | title = Books |date=September 18, 1964 |access-date=March 3, 2012}}</ref>

Remaining in the Arizona [[Air National Guard]] and [[Air Force Reserve]] after the war, he eventually retired as a [[Command Pilot]] with the rank of [[Major general (United States)|major general]].<ref>{{cite web| publisher=U.S. Air Force |title=Major General Barry M Goldwater |url=http://www.af.mil/information/bios/bio.asp?bioID=5574|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130331211943/http://www.af.mil/information/bios/bio.asp?bioID=5574|archive-date=March 31, 2013}}</ref> By that time, he had flown 165 different types of aircraft. As an Air Force Reserve major general, he continued piloting aircraft, to include the [[Boeing B-52 Stratofortress|B-52 Stratofortress]], until late in his military career.[[File:Major General Barry M. Goldwater in the Cockpit of Convair F-102.jpg|thumb|247x247px|Major General Barry M. Goldwater piloting a [[Convair F-102 Delta Dagger]] in 1967.|alt=]]As a U.S. Senator, Goldwater had a sign in his office that referenced his military career and mindset: "There are old pilots and there are bold pilots, but there are no old, bold pilots."<ref>{{Cite news|title=The Gold Standard: Barry Goldwater's 30-year U.S. Senate career made him an icon in Arizona politics|last=Harris|first=Don|date=12 Mar 2012|work=Arizona Capital Times}}</ref>

=== Interests ===
Goldwater ran track and cross country in high school, where he specialized in the [[800 metres|880]] yard run. His parents strongly encouraged him to compete in these sports, to his dismay. He often went by the nickname of "Rolling Thunder".{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}

In 1940, Goldwater became one of the first people to run the [[Colorado River]] recreationally through [[Grand Canyon]] participating as an oarsman on [[Norman Nevills]]' second commercial river trip. Goldwater joined them in [[Green River, Utah]], and rowed his own boat down to [[Lake Mead]].<ref>{{Citation | last = Lavender | first = David | title = River Runners of the Grand Canyon | isbn = 978-0816509409| year = 1985 }}</ref> In 1970 the Arizona Historical Foundation published the daily journal Goldwater had maintained on the Grand Canyon journey, including his photographs, in a 209-page volume titled ''Delightful Journey''.

In 1963 he joined the Arizona Society of the [[Sons of the American Revolution]]. He was also a lifetime member of the [[Veterans of Foreign Wars]], the [[American Legion]], and [[Sigma Chi]] fraternity. He belonged to both the [[York Rite]] and [[Scottish Rite]] of Freemasonry, and was awarded the 33rd degree in the Scottish Rite.

== Early Political Career ==
{{conservatism US}}
In a heavily Democratic state, Goldwater became a conservative Republican and a friend of [[Herbert Hoover]]. He was outspoken against [[Modern liberalism in the United States|New Deal liberalism]], especially its close ties to labor unions. A pilot, amateur radio operator, outdoorsman and photographer, he criss-crossed Arizona and developed a deep interest in both the natural and the human history of the state.{{libertarianism in the United States sidebar}}He entered Phoenix politics in 1949, when he was elected to the City Council as part of a nonpartisan team of candidates pledged to clean up widespread prostitution and gambling. The team won every mayoral and council election for the next two decades. Goldwater rebuilt the weak Republican party and was instrumental in electing [[John Howard Pyle|Howard Pyle]] as [[Governor of Arizona|Governor]] in 1950.<ref>Robert Alan Goldberg, ''Barry Goldwater'' (1995) pp. 67–98</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/daily/may98/goldwaterchrono.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20000914042048/http://washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/daily/may98/goldwaterchrono.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=September 14, 2000 |work=The Washington Post |date=June 5, 1998 |access-date=March 30, 2010 |title=A Look at the Life of Barry Goldwater }}</ref>

=== Senator ===

As a Republican he won a seat in the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]] in [[1952 United States Senate election in Arizona|1952]], when he upset veteran Democrat and Senate Majority Leader [[Ernest McFarland]].  He won largely by defeating McFarland in his native [[Maricopa County]] by 12,600 votes, almost double the overall margin of 6,725 votes. As a measure of how Democratic Arizona had been since joining the Union 40 years earlier, Goldwater was only the second Republican ever to represent Arizona in the Senate.  In his first year in the Senate he desegregated the Senate cafeteria, insisting that his black legislative assistant, Kathrine Maxwell, be served along with every other Senate employee.<ref>Edwards, Lee (1995) Goldwater: The Man Who Made a Revolution p.231</ref> He defeated McFarland again in [[United States Senate elections, 1958|1958]], with a strong showing in his first reelection; he was the first Arizona Republican to win a second term in the Senate. Goldwater's victory was all the more remarkable since it came in a year the Democrats gained 13 seats in the Senate. He gave up re-election for the Senate in 1964 in favor of his presidential campaign.

During his Senate career, Goldwater was regarded as the "Grand Old Man of the Republican Party and one of the nation's most respected exponents of conservatism".<ref>{{cite news|last1=Barnes|first1=Bart|title=Barry Goldwater, GOP Hero, Dies|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/daily/may98/goldwater30.htm|access-date=October 4, 2014|work=The Washington Post|date=May 30, 1998}}</ref>

=== Criticism of the Eisenhower Administration ===
Goldwater was outspoken about the Eisenhower administration, calling some of the policies of the Eisenhower administration too liberal for a Republican President. "...Democrats delighted in pointing out that the junior senator was so headstrong that he had gone out his way to criticize the president of his own party."<ref>{{Cite book |title=Goldwater: the man who made a revolution |last=Edwards |first=Lee |publisher=Regnery Publishing |year=1995 |isbn=0895264714 |location=Washington, D.C. |page=[https://archive.org/details/goldwater00leee/page/89 89] |url=https://archive.org/details/goldwater00leee/page/89 }}</ref> There was a Democratic majority in Congress for most of Eisenhower's career and Goldwater felt that [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|President Dwight Eisenhower]] was compromising too much with Democrats in order to get legislation passed. Early on in his career as a senator for Arizona, he criticized the $71.8&nbsp;billion budget that President Eisenhower sent to Congress, stating "Now, however, I am not so sure. A $71.8&nbsp;billion budget not only shocks me, but it weakens my faith."<ref>{{Cite book|title=Before the Storm: Barry Goldwater and the Unmaking of the American Consensus |url=https://archive.org/details/beforestormbarry0000perl_k0s0 |url-access=registration |last=Perlstein |first=Rick |publisher=Nation Books |year=2009 |isbn=978-1568584126 |page=[https://archive.org/details/beforestormbarry0000perl_k0s0/page/33 33] |oclc=938852638 }}</ref> Goldwater opposed Eisenhower's pick of [[Earl Warren]] for Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. "The day that Eisenhower appointed Governor Earl Warren of California as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, Goldwater did not hesitate to express his misgivings."<ref>Edwards, p. 57</ref> Goldwater and the Eisenhower administration supported the integration of schools in the south, but Goldwater felt the states should choose how they wanted to integrate and should not be forced by the federal government. "Goldwater criticized the use of federal troops. He accused the Eisenhower administration of violating the Constitution by assuming powers reserved by the states. While he agreed that under the law, every state should have integrated its schools, each state should integrate in its own way."<ref>Edwards, p. 233</ref> There were high-ranking government officials following Goldwater's critical stance on the Eisenhower administration, even an Army General. "Fulbright's startling revelation that military personnel were being indoctrinated with the idea that the policies of the Commander in Chief were treasonous dovetailed with the return to the news of the strange case of General [[Edwin Walker]]."<ref>Perlstein, p. 147</ref>

== 1964 Presidential Election ==

=== Republican Primary ===
In 1964, Goldwater fought and won a multi-candidate race for the Republican Party's presidential nomination. His main rival was New York Governor [[Nelson Rockefeller]], whom he defeated by a narrow margin in the California primary.

In South Dakota and Florida, Goldwater finished second to "unpledged delegates", but he finished before all other candidates]]
At the time of Goldwater's presidential candidacy, the Republican Party was split between its conservative wing (based in the West and South) and moderate/liberal wing, sometimes called [[Rockefeller Republican]]s (based in the Northeast). Goldwater alarmed even some of his fellow partisans with his brand of staunch [[Fiscal conservatives|fiscal conservatism]] and militant [[anti-communism]]. He was viewed by many traditional Republicans as being too far on the right wing of the political spectrum to appeal to the mainstream majority necessary to win a national election. As a result, moderate Republicans recruited a series of opponents, including [[New York (state)|New York]] Governor [[Nelson Rockefeller]], [[Henry Cabot Lodge Jr.]], of [[Massachusetts]] and [[Pennsylvania]] Governor [[William Scranton]], to challenge him. Goldwater would defeat Rockefeller in the winner-take-all California primary and secure the nomination. He also had a solid backing from Southern Republicans. A young [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]] lawyer, [[John Grenier]], secured commitments from 271 of 279 Southern convention delegates to back Goldwater. Grenier would serve as executive director of the national GOP during the Goldwater campaign, the number 2 position to party chairman [[Dean Burch]] of Arizona.

Journalist John Adams says, "his acceptance speech was bold, reflecting his conservative views, but not irrational.  Rather than shrinking from those critics who accuse him of extremism, Goldwater challenged them head-on" in his acceptance speech at the 1964 Republican Convention.<ref>{{cite book|author=Adams, John |title=In the Trenches: Adventures in Journalism and Public Affairs|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hsALOP-k6-gC&pg=PA73|year=2012|pages=73–|isbn=978-1462067831}}</ref> In his own words:

His paraphrase of [[Cicero]] was included at the suggestion of [[Harry V. Jaffa]], though the speech was primarily written by [[Karl Hess]]. Because of President Johnson's popularity, Goldwater refrained from attacking the president directly. He did not mention Johnson by name at all in his convention speech.

[[File:Goldwater-Reagan in 1964.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ronald Reagan]] speaks for presidential candidate Goldwater in Los Angeles, 1964]]
Former U.S. Senator [[Prescott Bush]], a [[moderate Republican]] from [[Connecticut]], was a friend of Goldwater and supported him in the general election campaign. Bush's son, [[George H. W. Bush]] (then running for the Senate from Texas against Democrat [[Ralph Yarborough]]), was also a strong Goldwater supporter in both the nomination and general election campaigns.

Future Chief Justice of the United States and fellow Arizonan [[William H. Rehnquist]] also first came to the attention of national Republicans through his work as a legal adviser to Goldwater's presidential campaign. Rehnquist had begun his law practice in 1953 in the firm of [[Denison Kitchel]] of Phoenix, Goldwater's national campaign manager and friend of nearly three decades.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://articles.latimes.com/2002/oct/24/local/me-kitchel24|title=Denison Kitchel, 94; Ran Goldwater's Presidential Bid|date=October 24, 2002|first=Dennis|last=McLellan|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|access-date=June 2, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131106065221/http://articles.latimes.com/2002/oct/24/local/me-kitchel24|archive-date=November 6, 2013}}</ref>

Goldwater was painted as a dangerous figure by the Johnson campaign, which countered Goldwater's slogan "In your heart, you know he's right" with the lines "In your guts, you know he's nuts," and "In your heart, you know he might" (that is, he might actually use nuclear weapons as opposed to using only [[deterrence theory|deterrence]]). Johnson himself did not mention Goldwater in his own acceptance speech at the [[1964 Democratic National Convention]].

Goldwater's provocative advocacy of aggressive tactics to prevent the spread of communism in Asia led to effective counterattacks from [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] and his supporters, who claimed that Goldwater's militancy would have dire consequences, possibly even nuclear war. In a May 1964 speech, Goldwater suggested that nuclear weapons should be treated more like conventional weapons and used in Vietnam, specifically that they should have been used at [[Dien Bien Phu]] in 1954 to defoliate trees.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Nuclear Weapons and the Vietnam War |url=http://www.watsoninstitute.org/pub/vietnam_weapons.pdf |last=Tannenwald |first=Nina |s2cid=153628491 |journal=The Journal of Strategic Studies |volume=29 |issue=4 |year=2006 |pages=675–722 |doi=10.1080/01402390600766148 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131101174405/http://www.watsoninstitute.org/pub/vietnam_weapons.pdf |archive-date=November 1, 2013 |url-status=dead |access-date=May 8, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Regarding Vietnam, Goldwater charged that Johnson's policy was devoid of "goal, course, or purpose," leaving "only sudden death in the jungles and the slow strangulation of freedom".<ref>Matthews 2002</ref> Goldwater's rhetoric on nuclear war was viewed by many as quite uncompromising, a view buttressed by off-hand comments such as, "Let's lob one into the men's room at the [[Moscow Kremlin|Kremlin]]."<ref>{{cite journal |journal=Harper's Magazine |url=http://www.mindfully.org/Reform/2004/Republican-Propaganda1sep04.htm|archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20091012003831/http://www.mindfully.org/Reform/2004/Republican-Propaganda1sep04.htm|title=Tentacles of Rage: The Republican propaganda mill, a brief history|author=Lapham, Lewis H. |volume=309|issue=1852|date= September 2004 |archive-date=October 12, 2009}}</ref> He also advocated that field commanders in Vietnam and Europe should be given the authority to use [[tactical nuclear weapon]]s (which he called "small conventional nuclear weapons") without presidential confirmation.<ref>{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rUwEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA11-IA1 |title=Our Defense: a Crucial Issue for Candidates |work=Life |date=September 25, 1964 |page=11 |access-date=March 3, 2012}}</ref>

Goldwater countered the Johnson attacks by criticizing the administration for its perceived ethical lapses, and stating in a commercial that "we, as a nation, are not far from the kind of moral decay that has brought on the fall of other nations and people.... I say it is time to put conscience back in government. And by good example, put it back in all walks of American life."

Before the 1964 election, ''[[Fact (U.S. magazine)|Fact]]'' magazine, published by [[Ralph Ginzburg]], ran a special issue titled "The Unconscious of a Conservative: A Special Issue on the Mind of Barry Goldwater". The two main articles contended that Goldwater was mentally unfit to be president. The magazine supported this claim with the results of a poll of board-certified psychiatrists. ''Fact'' had mailed questionnaires to 12,356 psychiatrists, receiving responses from 2,417, of whom 1,189 said Goldwater was mentally incapable of holding the office of president. Most of the other respondents declined to diagnose Goldwater because they had not clinically interviewed him, but claimed that, although not psychologically unfit to preside, Goldwater would be negligent and egregious in the role.<ref>{{cite news|author=Richard A.

==== Political advertising ====
{{main|Daisy (advertisement)}}
[[File:Daisy (1964).webm|thumb|left|300px|thumbtime=3|"Daisy" advertisement]]
A Democratic campaign advertisement known as [[Daisy (advertisement)|Daisy]] showed a young girl counting daisy petals, from one to ten. Immediately following this scene, a voiceover counted down from ten to one. The child's face was shown as a still photograph followed by images of [[Effects of nuclear explosions|nuclear explosions]] and [[mushroom cloud]]s. The campaign advertisement ended with a plea to vote for Johnson, implying that Goldwater (though not mentioned by name) would provoke a [[nuclear war]] if elected. The advertisement, which featured only a few spoken words and relied on imagery for its emotional impact, was one of the most provocative in American political campaign history, and many analysts credit it as being the birth of the modern style of "[[negative campaigning|negative political ads]]" on television. The ad aired only once and was immediately pulled, but it was then shown many times by local television stations covering the controversy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.livingroomcandidate.org/commercials/1964/peace-little-girl-daisy|title="Daisy" ad |publisher=Livingroomcandidate.org|date=September 7, 1964|access-date=March 3, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140426231953/http://www.livingroomcandidate.org/commercials/1964/peace-little-girl-daisy|archive-date=April 26, 2014}}</ref>

Past comments came back to haunt Goldwater throughout the campaign. He had once called the [[Eisenhower administration]] "a dime-store New Deal" and the former President never fully forgave him. However, Eisenhower did film a television commercial with Goldwater.<ref>{{Citation|title=Living room candidate|year=1964|url=http://www.livingroomcandidate.org/commercials/1964/ike-at-gettysburg|contribution=Ike at Gettysburg|publisher=Goldwater|type=campaign ad|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019120627/http://www.livingroomcandidate.org/commercials/1964/ike-at-gettysburg|archive-date=October 19, 2013 }}</ref> Eisenhower qualified his voting for Goldwater in November by remarking that he had voted not specifically for Goldwater, but for the Republican Party.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Polsky|first1=Andrew|title=The Eisenhower Presidency: Lessons for the Twenty-First Century|date=November 30, 2015|publisher=Lexington Books|isbn=978-1498522205|pages=33, 296|edition=1st|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VItCCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA33&q=did%20eisenhower%20vote%20for%20goldwater|access-date=November 22, 2016}}</ref> In December 1961, Goldwater had told a news conference that "sometimes I think this country would be better off if we could just saw off the Eastern Seaboard and let it float out to sea."

The Goldwater campaign spotlighted [[Ronald Reagan]], who appeared in a campaign ad.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.livingroomcandidate.org/commercials/1964/ronald-reagan|publisher=Goldwater|type=ad|title=The Living Room Candidate – Commercials – 1964 – Ronald Reagan|date=September 7, 1964|access-date= March 3, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131020013734/http://www.livingroomcandidate.org/commercials/1964/ronald-reagan|archive-date=October 20, 2013}}</ref> In turn, Reagan gave a stirring, nationally televised speech, "[[A Time for Choosing]]", in support of Goldwater.<ref>{{Citation|first=Ronald|last=Reagan|url=http://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/ronaldreaganatimeforchoosing.htm|title=A Time for Choosing|type=televised address on behalf of Barry Goldwater|date=October 27, 1964|place=Los Angeles, CA|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140214035102/http://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/ronaldreaganatimeforchoosing.htm|archive-date=February 14, 2014}}</ref> The speech prompted Reagan to seek the [[Governor of California|California Governorship]] in 1966 and jump-started his political career. Conservative activist [[Phyllis Schlafly]], later well known for her fight against the [[Equal Rights Amendment]], first became known for writing a pro-Goldwater book, ''A Choice, Not an Echo'', attacking the moderate Republican establishment.

==== Results ====
[[File:ElectoralCollege1964.svg|thumb|300px|Presidential election results by state]]
Goldwater [[1964 United States presidential election|lost to President Lyndon Johnson]] by a landslide, pulling down the Republican Party which lost many seats in both houses of Congress.

Goldwater only won his home state of Arizona and five states in the [[Deep South]], depicted in red. The Southern states, traditionally Democratic up to that time, voted Republican primarily as a statement of opposition to the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964|Civil Rights Act]], which had been passed by Johnson and the Northern Democrats, as well as the majority of Republicans in Congress, earlier that year.<ref name="Bernard Cosman 1966" /><ref>Charles S Bullock III, and Mark J. Rozell, ''The Oxford Handbook of Southern Politics'' (2012) p. 303</ref>

In the end, Goldwater received 38% of the popular vote, and carried just six states: Arizona (with 51% of the popular vote) and the core states of the [[Deep South]]: Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, and South Carolina. In carrying Georgia by a margin of 54–45%, Goldwater became the first Republican nominee to win the state. However, the overall result was the worst showing in terms of popular vote and electoral college vote for any post-World War II Republican.  Indeed, he wouldn't have even carried his own state if not for a 20,000-vote margin in Maricopa County.

In all, Johnson won an overwhelming 486 electoral votes, to Goldwater's 52. Goldwater, with his customary bluntness, remarked, "We would have lost even if [[Abraham Lincoln]] had come back and campaigned with us." He maintained later in life that he would have won the election if the country had not been in a state of extended grief following the [[assassination of John F. Kennedy]], and that it was simply not ready for a third president in just 14 months.

Goldwater's poor showing pulled down many supporters. Of the 57 Republican Congressmen who endorsed Goldwater before the convention, 20 were defeated for reelection, along with many promising young Republicans. On the other hand, the defeat of so many older politicians created openings for young conservatives to move up the ladder. While the loss of moderate Republicans was temporary—they were back by 1966—Goldwater also permanently pulled many conservative Southerners and white ethnics out of the [[New Deal Coalition]].<ref>Goldberg, ''Barry Goldwater'' pp. 232–37</ref>

According to [[Steve Kornacki]] of ''[[Salon (website)|Salon]]'', "Goldwater broke through and won five [Southern] states—the best showing in the region for a GOP candidate since Reconstruction. In Mississippi—where Franklin D. Roosevelt had won nearly 100 percent of the vote 28 years earlier—Goldwater claimed a staggering 87 percent."<ref>[[Kornacki, Steve]] (February 3, 2011) [http://www.salon.com/news/politics/war_room/2011/02/03/reagan_southern_strategy/index.html The "Southern Strategy", fulfilled], ''[[Salon (website)|Salon]]'' {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110413151441/http://www.salon.com/news/politics/war_room/2011/02/03/reagan_southern_strategy/index.html |date=April 13, 2011 }}</ref> It has frequently been argued that Goldwater's strong performance in Southern states previously regarded as Democratic strongholds foreshadowed a larger shift in electoral trends in the coming decades that would make the South a Republican bastion (an end to the "[[Solid South]]")—first in presidential politics and eventually at the congressional and state levels, as well.<ref>{{cite news |first=Daniel |last=Rodriguez | author1-link = Daniel B.

Goldwater remained popular in Arizona, and in the [[1968 United States Senate election in Arizona|1968 Senate election]] he was elected to the seat of retiring Senator [[Carl Hayden]]. He was subsequently reelected in 1974 and 1980. 

Throughout the late 1970s, as the conservative wing under Ronald Reagan gained control of the Republican Party, Goldwater concentrated on his Senate duties, especially in military affairs. He played little part in the election or administration of [[Richard Nixon]], but he helped force Nixon's resignation in 1974.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/printout/0,8816,942972,00.html |title=The Last Week: The Unmaking of the President |work=Time |date=August 19, 1974 |access-date=March 3, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120917195702/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/printout/0,8816,942972,00.html |archive-date=September 17, 2012 }}</ref> At the height of the [[Watergate]] scandal, Goldwater met with Nixon at the White House and urged him to resign.

Naughton (November 6, 1974). "Senate and House Margins Are Substantially Enlarged". New York Times. Archived from the original on March 5, 2016.</ref>

At the 1976 Republican National Convention, Goldwater help block Rockefeller’s renominated as Vice President. When Reagan challenged Ford for the presidential nomination in 1976, Goldwater endorsed the incumbent Ford, looking for consensus rather than conservative idealism. As one historian notes, "The Arizonan had lost much of his zest for battle."<ref>Kolkey, Jonathan Martin. ''The New Right, 1960–1968: With Epilogue, 1969–1980''.

In 1979, when President Carter normalized relations with [[People's Republic of China|Communist China]], Goldwater and some other Senators sued him in the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]], arguing that the President could not terminate the [[Sino-American Mutual Defense Treaty]] with [[Republic of China]] ([[Taiwan]]) without the approval of [[Congress of the United States|Congress]]. The case, ''[[Goldwater v. Carter]]'' 444 U.S. 996, was dismissed by the court as a [[political question]].

With his fourth Senate term due to end in January 1981, Goldwater seriously considered retiring from the Senate in 1980 before deciding to run for one final term. It was a surprisingly tough [[1980 United States Senate election in Arizona|battle for re-election]]. Goldwater was viewed by some as out of touch and vulnerable for several reasons, chiefly because he had planned to retire in 1981, he had not visited many areas of Arizona outside of Phoenix and Tucson. Additionally, his Democrat challenger, [[Bill Schulz (politician)|Bill Schulz]], proved to be a formidable opponent. A former Republican and a wealthy real estate developer, Schultz’s campaign slogan was "Energy for the Eighties." Arizona's changing population also hurt Goldwater. The state's population had soared and a huge portion of the electorate had not lived in the state when Goldwater was previously elected; meaning unlike most incumbents, many voters were less familiar with Goldwater‘s actual beliefs. Goldwater would go on to spend most of the campaign on the defensive. Although he went on to win the general election by a very narrow margin, receiving 49.5% of the vote to Schulz's 48.4%,<ref>{{Cite web| title=Schulz, William| url=http://www.ahfweb.org/download/Schulz_MSS_125.pdf| website=ahfweb.org| publisher=Arizona Historical Foundation| location=Tempe, Arizona| access-date=November 1, 2019}}</ref> early returns on election night indicated that Schulz would win. The counting of votes continued through the night and into the next morning. At around daybreak, Goldwater learned that he had been reelected thanks to [[absentee ballot]]s, which were among the last to be counted.{{Sfn | Goldberg | 1995 | loc = chapter 12}} 

Goldwater's surprisingly close victory in 1980 came despite Reagan's 61% landslide over [[Jimmy Carter]] in Arizona. Despite Goldwater’s struggles, in 1980 Republicans were able to pick up 12 senate seats, regaining control of the chamber for the first time since 1955, when Goldwater was in his first term. Goldwater was now in the most powerful position he had ever been in the Senate. In October 1983, Goldwater voted against the [[Passage of Martin Luther King Jr. Day|legislation]] establishing [[Martin Luther King Jr. Day]] as a [[Federal holidays in the United States|federal holiday]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/98-1983/s293|title=To Pass H.R. 3706. (Motion Passed) See Note(s) 19.}}</ref>

After the new senate convened in January 1981, Goldwater became chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee. In this role he had a notable clash with the Reagan administration in April 1984 when he discovered that the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) had been mining the waters of Nicaragua since February, something that he had first denied when the matter was raised.<ref name=Brogan>Brogan ''The Fighting Never Stopped'', 1989 p. 449</ref> In a note to the CIA director William Casey, Goldwater denounced what he called an "act of war", saying that "this is no way to run a railroad" as he stated crossly that only Congress had the power to declare war and accused the CIA of illegally mining Nicaraguan waters without the permission of Congress.<ref name=Brogan /> Goldwater concluded: "The President has asked us to back his foreign policy. Bill, how can we back his foreign policy when we don't know what the hell he is doing? Lebanon, yes, we all knew that he sent troops over there. But mine the harbors in Nicaragua? This is an act violating international law. It is an act of war. For the life of me, I don't see how we are going to explain it."<ref name=Brogan /> Goldwater felt compelled to issue an apology on the floor of the Senate because the Senate Intelligence Committee had failed in its duties to oversee the CIA as he stated: "I am forced to apologize for the members of my committee because I did not know the facts on this case. And I apologize to all the members of the Senate for the same reason".<ref>Grande, ''Our Own Backyard'', 2000 p.334</ref> Goldwater subsequently voted for a Congressional resolution condemning the mining.<ref name=Brogan />

=== Retirement ===

Goldwater said later that the close result in 1980 convinced him not to run again.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsuxC6Ft92I | title = YouTube | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20101104112917/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsuxC6Ft92I| archive-date = November 4, 2010}}</ref> He retired in 1987, serving as chair of the Senate Intelligence and Armed Services Committees in his final term. Despite his reputation as a firebrand in the 1960s, by the end of his career he was considered a stabilizing influence in the Senate, one of the most respected members of either major party. Although Goldwater remained staunchly anti-communist and "hawkish" on military issues, he was a key supporter of the fight for ratification of the [[Panama Canal Treaty]] in the 1970s, which would give control of the canal zone to the Republic of [[Panama]]. His most important legislative achievement may have been the [[Goldwater–Nichols Act]], which reorganized the U.S. military's senior-command structure.

== Policies ==
Goldwater became most associated with labor-union reform and anti-communism; he was a supporter of the [[conservative coalition]] in Congress. His work on labor issues led to Congress passing major anti-corruption reforms in 1957, and an all-out campaign by the [[AFL-CIO]] to defeat his 1958 reelection bid. He voted against the censure of Senator [[Joseph McCarthy]] in 1954, but he never actually charged any individual with being a communist/Soviet agent. Goldwater emphasized his strong opposition to the worldwide spread of communism in his 1960 book ''[[The Conscience of a Conservative]]''. The book became an important reference text in conservative political circles.

In 1964, Goldwater ran a conservative campaign that emphasized states' rights.{{Sfn | Donaldson | 2003 | p = 20}}  Goldwater's 1964 campaign was a magnet for conservatives since he opposed interference by the federal government in state affairs. Goldwater voted in favor of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1957]] and the [[Twenty-fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|24th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/85-1957/s75|title=HR. 6127.

All this [[Southern strategy|appealed to white Southern Democrats]], and Goldwater was the first Republican to win the electoral votes of all of the Deep South states ([[South Carolina]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Alabama]], [[Mississippi]] and [[Louisiana]]) since [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]].<ref name="Bernard Cosman 1966">{{Citation | first = Bernard | last = Cosman | title = Five States for Goldwater: Continuity and change in Southern presidential voting patterns | year = 1966}}</ref> However, Goldwater's vote on the Civil Rights Act proved devastating to his campaign everywhere outside the South (besides Dixie, Goldwater won only in Arizona, his home state), contributing to his landslide defeat in 1964.

While Goldwater had been depicted by his opponents in the Republican primaries as a representative of a [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] philosophy that was extreme and alien, his voting records show that his positions were in harmony with those of his fellow Republicans in the Congress. According to [[Hans J. Morgenthau]], what distinguished him from his predecessors was his firmness of principle and determination, which did not allow him to be content with mere rhetoric.<ref>{{Citation | first = Hans J | last = Morgenthau | title = Goldwater – The Romantic Regression | newspaper = Commentary |date=September 1964}}</ref>

Goldwater fought in 1971 to stop U.S. funding of the United Nations after the People's Republic of China was admitted to the organization. He said:
{{quote | I suggested on the floor of the Senate today that we stop all funds for the United Nations. Now, what that'll do to the United Nations, I don't know. I have a hunch it would cause them to fold up, which would make me very happy at this particular point. I think if this happens, they can well move their headquarters to Peking or Moscow and get 'em out of this country.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.upi.com/Audio/Year_in_Review/Events-of-1971/12295509436546-1/#title |title=Red China Admitted to UN: 1971 Year in Review |agency=United Press International |date=December 28, 1971 |access-date=March 3, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090503142809/http://www.upi.com/Audio/Year_in_Review/Events-of-1971/12295509436546-1/#title |archive-date=May 3, 2009 |url-status=dead |df=mdy }}</ref>}}

=== Goldwater and the revival of American conservatism ===
Although Goldwater was not as important in the [[Conservatism in the United States|American conservative]] movement as [[Ronald Reagan]] after 1965, he shaped and redefined the movement from the late 1950s to 1964. Arizona Senator [[John McCain]], who had succeeded Goldwater in the Senate in 1987, summed up Goldwater's legacy, "He transformed the Republican Party from an Eastern elitist organization to the breeding ground for the election of Ronald Reagan."<ref>{{cite news|last=Grove |first=Lloyd |title=Barry Goldwater's Left Turn |work=The Washington Post |date=July 28, 1994 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/daily/may98/goldwater072894.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20000914042130/http://washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/daily/may98/goldwater072894.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=September 14, 2000 |access-date=October 25, 2008 }}</ref> Columnist [[George Will]] remarked after the [[1980 United States presidential election|1980 presidential election]] that it took 16 years to count the votes from 1964 and Goldwater won.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/daily/may98/will31.htm |title=The Cheerful Malcontent|work=The Washington Post|first=George|last=Will|author-link=George Will|date=May 31, 1998 |access-date=May 7, 2019}}</ref>

The Republican Party recovered from the 1964 election debacle, acquiring 47 seats in the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] in the [[1966 United States House of Representatives elections|1966 mid-term election]]. Further Republican successes ensued, including Goldwater's return to the Senate in 1969. In January of that year, Goldwater wrote an article in the ''[[National Review]]'' "affirming that he [was] not against liberals, that liberals are needed as a counterweight to conservatism, and that he had in mind a fine liberal like [[Max Lerner]]".<ref>[[Murray Rothbard|Rothbard, Murray N.]]. [https://www.mises.org/story/1842 "Confessions of a Right-Wing Liberal]".

Goldwater was a strong supporter of environmental protection. He explained his position in 1969:
{{quote|I feel very definitely that the [Nixon] administration is absolutely correct in cracking down on companies and corporations and municipalities that continue to pollute the nation's air and water. While I am a great believer in the free competitive enterprise system and all that it entails, I am an even stronger believer in the right of our people to live in a clean and pollution-free environment. To this end, it is my belief that when pollution is found, it should be halted at the source, even if this requires stringent government action against important segments of our national economy.<ref>Barry Goldwater, ''The Conscience of a Majority'' (1969) in Brian Allen Drake, "The Skeptical Environmentalist: Senator Barry Goldwater and the Environmental Management State", ''Environmental History'', (2010) 15#4 pp. 587–611, [589]</ref>}}

== Later life ==
[[File:Goldwater1983.jpg|thumb|left|Signing autographs at the Fiesta Bowl parade in 1983]]
By the 1980s, with [[Ronald Reagan]] as president and the growing involvement of the [[Christian right|religious right]] in conservative politics, Goldwater's [[Libertarianism in the United States|libertarian]] views on personal issues were revealed; he believed that they were an integral part of true conservatism. Goldwater viewed abortion as a matter of personal choice and as such supported abortion rights.{{Sfn | Goldberg | 1995 | p = 331}}

As a passionate defender of personal liberty, he saw the religious right's views as an encroachment on personal privacy and [[Civil liberties|individual liberties]].{{Sfn | Goldberg | 1995 | p = 315}}  In his 1980 Senate reelection campaign, Goldwater won support from [[religious conservative]]s but in his final term voted consistently to uphold legalized abortion and in 1981 gave a speech on how he was angry about the bullying of American politicians by religious organizations, and would "fight them every step of the way".<ref>{{Citation | url = http://pieceofmind.wordpress.com/2006/11/10/wwbd-what-would-barry-do/ | title = Piece of mind | contribution = WWBD: What Would Barry Do | publisher = Word press | date = November 10, 2006| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131029205651/http://pieceofmind.wordpress.com/2006/11/10/wwbd-what-would-barry-do/ | archive-date = October 29, 2013 }}</ref><ref>{{Citation | last = Goldwater | newspaper = Los Angeles Times | date = September 17, 1981 | title = The 'New Right' Has Nothing to Do with the 'Old Conservatism'}}</ref><ref>{{Citation | page = 39 | title = The God Delusion| title-link = The God Delusion}}</ref> Goldwater also disagreed with the Reagan administration on certain aspects of foreign policy (for example, he opposed the decision to [[CIA activities in Nicaragua#Nicaragua 1981|mine Nicaraguan harbors]]). Notwithstanding his prior differences with [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], Goldwater in a 1986 interview rated him the best of the seven presidents with whom he had worked. {{Citation needed|reason=This is a specific claim from an interview but only a year is given|date=September 2019}}

He introduced the [[1984 Cable Franchise Policy and Communications Act]], which allowed local governments to require the transmission of [[public, educational, and government access]] (PEG) channels, barred cable operators from exercising editorial control over content of programs carried on PEG channels, and absolved them from liability for their content.

On May 12, 1986, Goldwater was presented with the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] by President [[Ronald Reagan]].

After his retirement in 1987, Goldwater described the Arizona Governor [[Evan Mecham]] as "hardheaded" and called on him to resign, and two years later stated that the Republican party had been taken over by a "bunch of kooks".{{Sfn | Goldberg | 1995 | p = 329}}

In 1987 he received the [[Langley Gold Medal]] from the [[Smithsonian Institution]]. In 1988, [[Princeton University]]'s [[American Whig-Cliosophic Society]] awarded Goldwater the [[James Madison Award for Distinguished Public Service]] in recognition of his career.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://archives-trim.un.org/webdrawer/rec/552938/view/Item-in-KAA%20Schoolsuniversities%202002%20-%20oct.%20-%20dec..PDF | title = Item in KAA | publisher = UN| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20121226142153/http://archives-trim.un.org/webdrawer/rec/552938/view/Item-in-KAA%20Schoolsuniversities%202002%20-%20oct.%20-%20dec..PDF | archive-date = December 26, 2012 }}</ref>

In a 1994 interview with ''[[The Washington Post]]'', the retired senator said,

Goldwater visited the small town of [[Bowen, Illinois]], in 1989 to see where his mother was raised.

In response to [[Moral Majority]] founder [[Jerry Falwell]]'s opposition to the nomination of [[Sandra Day O'Connor]] to the Supreme Court, of which Falwell had said, "Every good Christian should be concerned", Goldwater retorted: "Every good Christian ought to kick Falwell right in the ass."<ref>{{Citation|first=Ed |last=Magnuson |newspaper=[[Time Magazine|Time]] |url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,212563,00.html |title=The Brethren's First Sister |date=July 20, 1981 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070115035218/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,954833,00.html|archive-date=January 15, 2007 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>Goldberg, ''Barry Goldwater'', p. 315</ref> According to [[John Dean]], Goldwater actually suggested that good Christians ought to kick Falwell in the "nuts", but the news media "changed the anatomical reference".<ref>{{Citation | last = Dean | first = John | title = Broken Government | year = 2008 | publisher = Penguin}}</ref>{{Rp | needed = yes | date =July 2013}} Goldwater also had harsh words for his one-time political protegé, President Reagan, particularly after the [[Iran–Contra Affair]] became public in 1986.

"He was sitting in his office with his hands on his cane... and he said to me, 'Well, aren't you going to ask me about the [[Iran]] arms sales?'

Goldwater was a prominent spokesman for amateur radio and its enthusiasts. Beginning in 1969 up to his death he appeared in numerous educational and promotional films (and later videos) about the hobby that were produced for the [[American Radio Relay League]] (the United States national society representing the interests of radio amateurs) by such producers as Dave Bell (W6AQ), ARRL Southwest Director John R. Griggs (W6KW), Alan Kaul (W6RCL), Forrest Oden (N6ENV), and the late Roy Neal (K6DUE). His first appearance was in Dave Bell's ''The World of Amateur Radio'' where Goldwater discussed the history of the hobby and demonstrated a live contact with Antarctica. His last on-screen appearance dealing with "ham radio" was in 1994, explaining a then-upcoming, Earth-orbiting ham radio relay satellite.

Electronics was a hobby for Goldwater beyond amateur radio. He enjoyed assembling [[Heathkit]]s,<ref name="shea19820913">{{cite news | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EDAEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA26 | title=Buckley finds word processing on Z-89 'liberating' | work=InfoWorld | date=September 13, 1982 | access-date=January 9, 2015 | author=Shea, Tom | page=26}}</ref> completing more than 100 and often visiting their maker in [[Benton Harbor, Michigan]], to buy more, before the company exited the kit business in 1992.<ref name="fisher">Fisher, Lawrence M.

=== Kachina dolls ===
[[File:Kachina Dolls Heard Museum.jpg|thumb|Most of the kachina dolls at the Heard Museum were donated by Goldwater]]
In 1916 Goldwater visited the [[Hopi]] [[Indian Reservation|Reservation]] with Phoenix architect John Rinker Kibby, and obtained his first [[Hopi Kachina figure|kachina doll]]. Eventually his doll collection included 437 items and was presented in 1969 to the [[Heard Museum]] in Phoenix.<ref name="kachina">{{cite web|url=https://www.azcentral.com/specials/special25/articles/1203goldwater2.html |title=Goldwater Kachinas a public treasure |work=The Arizona Republic |date=December 3, 1986 |access-date=March 3, 2012}}</ref>

=== Photography ===
Goldwater was an amateur photographer and in his estate left some 15,000 of his images to three Arizona institutions. He was very keen on [[candid photography]]. He got started in photography after receiving a camera as a gift from his wife on their first Christmas together. He was known to use a [[Large format|4×5]] [[Graflex]], [[Rolleiflex]], 16&nbsp;mm [[Bell and Howell]] motion picture camera, and [[135 film|35 mm]] [[Nikkormat#Nikkormat FT|Nikkormat FT]]. He was a member of the [[Royal Photographic Society]] from 1941 becoming a Life Member in 1948.<ref>Information provided by The Royal Photographic Society, United Kingdom, dated October 6, 2011, [http://www.rps.org/ "Royal Photographic Society"].  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140402035959/http://www.rps.org/ |date=April 2, 2014 }}</ref>

For decades, he contributed photographs of his home state to ''[[Arizona Highways (magazine)|Arizona Highways]]'' and was best known for his Western landscapes and pictures of [[native Americans in the United States]]. Three books with his photographs are ''People and Places'', from 1967; ''Barry Goldwater and the Southwest'', from 1976; and ''Delightful Journey'', first published in 1940 and reprinted in 1970. [[Ansel Adams]] wrote a foreword to the 1976 book.<ref>''Arizona Republic'', May 31, 1998</ref>

Goldwater's photography interests occasionally crossed over with his political career. [[John F. Kennedy]], as president, was known to invite former congressional colleagues to the White House for a drink. On one occasion, Goldwater brought his camera and photographed President Kennedy. When Kennedy received the photo, he returned it to Goldwater, with the inscription, "For Barry Goldwater—Whom I urge to follow the career for which he has shown such talent—photography!—from his friend—John Kennedy." This quip became a classic of American political humor after it was made famous by humorist [[Bennett Cerf]]. The photo itself was prized by Goldwater for the rest of his life, and recently sold for $17,925 in a [[Heritage Auctions|Heritage]] auction.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://historical.ha.com/common/view_item.php?Sale_No=6047&Lot_No=47197 |title=Heritage Auctions description of signed Kennedy photo |publisher=Historical.ha.com |date=November 17, 2010 |access-date=March 3, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110221045509/http://historical.ha.com/common/view_item.php?Sale_No=6047&Lot_No=47197 |archive-date=February 21, 2011 }}</ref>

Son Michael Prescott Goldwater formed the Goldwater Family Foundation with the goal of making his father's photography available via the internet. (''Barry Goldwater Photographs'') was launched in September 2006 to coincide with the HBO documentary ''Mr. Conservative'', produced by granddaughter CC Goldwater.

=== UFOs ===
On March 28, 1975, Goldwater wrote to Shlomo Arnon: "The subject of UFOs has interested me for some long time. About ten or twelve years ago I made an effort to find out what was in the building at [[Wright-Patterson Air Force Base]] where the information has been stored that has been collected by the Air Force, and I was understandably denied this request. It is still classified above Top Secret."<ref name="anomalies.net" /> Goldwater further wrote that there were rumors the evidence would be released, and that he was "just as anxious to see this material as you are, and I hope we will not have to wait much longer".<ref name="anomalies.net">{{cite web|url=http://www.anomalies.net/archive/Text-Archive/txt1/469.ufo |title=FOIA documents | publisher = Anomalies |access-date=March 3, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120307074012/http://www.anomalies.net/archive/Text-Archive/txt1/469.ufo |archive-date=March 7, 2012 }}</ref>

The April 25, 1988 issue of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' carried an interview where Goldwater said he repeatedly asked his friend, General [[Curtis LeMay]], if there was any truth to the rumors that UFO evidence was stored in a secret room at Wright-Patterson, and if he (Goldwater) might have access to the room. According to Goldwater, an angry LeMay gave him "holy hell" and said, "Not only can't you get into it but don't you ever mention it to me again."<ref>{{cite news| first = Burton | last = Bernstein | title = AuH2O | newspaper = The New Yorker | date = April 25, 1988 | pages = 43, 71 |no-pp=y}}</ref>

In a 1988 interview on [[Larry King]]'s radio show, Goldwater was asked if he thought the U.S. Government was withholding UFO evidence; he replied "Yes, I do." He added:
{{quote | I certainly believe in aliens in space. They may not look like us, but I have very strong feelings that they have advanced beyond our mental capabilities... I think some highly secret government UFO investigations are going on that we don't know about—and probably never will unless the Air Force discloses them.<ref>{{cite web| first =P | last = Cooke |url=http://www.bibleufo.com/quotecong.htm |title=UFO Quotations – The United States Congress |publisher=Bible UFO | access-date = March 3, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130408230530/http://www.bibleufo.com/quotecong.htm |archive-date=April 8, 2013 }}</ref>{{unreliable fringe source|date=October 2017}}}}

== Goldwater Scholarship ==
The [[Barry M. Goldwater Scholarship]] and Excellence in Education Program was established by Congress in 1986.<ref>{{cite web|title=Barry Goldwater Scholarship and Excellence in Education Program|url=http://www.act.org/goldwater/|publisher=ACT, Inc|access-date=August 21, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022220814/http://www.act.org/goldwater/|archive-date=October 22, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> Its goal is to provide a continuing source of highly qualified scientists, mathematicians, and engineers by awarding scholarships to college students who intend to pursue careers in these fields.

The Scholarship is widely considered the most prestigious award in the U.S. conferred upon undergraduates studying the sciences. It is awarded to about 300 students (college sophomores and juniors) nationwide in the amount of $7,500 per academic year (for their senior year, or junior and senior years).<ref>{{cite web|title=Bulletin of Information for the 2013–2014 Competition|url=http://www.act.org/goldwater/yybull.html|publisher=Goldwater Scholarship Program|access-date=August 21, 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080916021418/http://www.act.org/goldwater/yybull.html|archive-date=September 16, 2008}}</ref> It honors Goldwater's keen interest in science and technology.

== Death ==

Goldwater's public appearances ended in late 1996 after he suffered a massive stroke; family members then disclosed he was in the early stages of [[Alzheimer's disease]].
