Estimates of the '''casualties from the conflict in Iraq''' (beginning with the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]], and the ensuing [[Iraqi insurgency (2003–11)|occupation and insurgency]]) have come in several forms, and those estimates of different types of [[Iraq War]] casualties vary greatly.

Estimating war-related deaths poses many challenges.<ref name="Wang_et_al_2016">{{cite journal|last1=Wang|first1=Haidong|display-authors=etal|date=8-14 October 2014|title=Global, regional, and national life expectancy, all-cause mortality, and cause-specific mortality for 249 causes of death, 1980–2015: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2015|journal=The Lancet|volume=388|issue=10053|pages=1459–1544|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(16)31012-1|pmid=27733281|pmc=5388903|quote=Indeed, it has been challenging to accurately document the number of casualties from wars and deaths resulting from malnutrition, infections, or disruption in health services during wars.}}</ref><ref name="Adhikari_et_al_2010">{{cite journal|last1=Adhikari|first1=Neill KJ|display-authors=etal|date=16-22 October 2010|title=Critical care and the global burden of critical illness in adults|journal=The Lancet|volume=376|issue=9749|pages=1339–1346|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(10)60446-1|pmid=20934212|quote=However, during times of war, we should remember that evidence from systematic household cluster sampling suggests that most excess deaths, and, by extension, most demands for intensive care, do not arise from violence but from medical disorders resulting from the breakdown of public health infrastructure (eg, cholera), or from the discontinuation of treatment of chronic diseases caused by interruption of pharmaceutical supplies.|pmc=7136988}}</ref> Experts distinguish between population-based studies, which extrapolate from random samples of the population, and body counts, which tally reported deaths and likely significantly underestimate casualties.<ref name="Tapp_et_al_2008">{{cite journal|last1=Tapp|first1=Christine|display-authors=etal|date=7 March 2008|title=Iraq War mortality estimates: A systematic review|journal=Conflict and Health|volume=2|issue=1|pages=1|doi=10.1186/1752-1505-2-1|pmid=18328100|pmc=2322964|quote=Of the population-based studies, the Roberts and Burnham studies provided the most rigorous methodology as their primary outcome was mortality. Their methodology is similar to the consensus methods of the SMART initiative, a series of methodological recommendations for conducting research in humanitarian emergencies. [...] However, not surprisingly their studies have been roundly criticized given the political consequences of their findings and the inherent security and political problems of conducting this type of research. Some of these criticisms refer to the type of sampling, duration of interviews, the potential for reporting bias, the reliability of its pre-war estimates, and a lack of reproducibility. The study authors have acknowledged their study limitations and responded to these criticisms in detail elsewhere. They now also provide their data for reanalysis to qualified groups for further review, if requested. [...] The IBC was largely established as an activist response to US refusals to conduct mortality counts. This account, however, is problematic as it relies solely on news reports that would likely considerably underestimate the total mortality.}}</ref> Population-based studies produce estimates of the number of Iraq War casualties ranging from 151,000 violent deaths as of June 2006 (per the [[Iraq Family Health Survey]]) to 1,033,000 (per the [[ORB survey of Iraq War casualties|2007 Opinion Research Business (ORB) survey]]). Other survey-based studies covering different time-spans find 461,000 total deaths (over 60% of them violent) as of June 2011 (per ''[[PLOS Medicine]]'' 2013), and 655,000 total deaths (over 90% of them violent) as of June 2006 (per the [[Lancet surveys of Iraq War casualties|2006 Lancet study]]). Body counts counted at least 110,600 violent deaths as of April 2009 ([[Associated Press]]). The [[Iraq Body Count project]] documents 185,000 - 208,000 violent civilian deaths through Feb 2020 in their table.

Although the methodology and results in the four studies cited here have varied somewhat, it is clear that the Iraq War caused, directly and indirectly, a very large number of deaths among Iraqi civilians—which, in fact, may have been underestimated by these scientifically conservative studies. A paper by Tapp and colleagues and a recent report by three country affiliates of the International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War have extensively reviewed these four epidemiological studies as well as other studies that attempted to assess the impact of the Iraq War on morbidity and mortality.|doi-access=free}}</ref>

The '''[[Lancet surveys of Iraq War casualties|Lancet study's]]''' figure of '''654,965''' excess deaths through the end of '''June 2006''' is based on household survey data. The estimate is for all excess violent and nonviolent deaths. That also includes those due to increased lawlessness, degraded infrastructure, poorer healthcare, etc. 601,027 deaths (range of 426,369 to 793,663 using a 95% [[confidence interval]]) were estimated to be due to violence. 31% of those were attributed to the Coalition, 24% to others, 46% unknown. The causes of violent deaths were [[gunshot]] (56%), [[car bomb]] (13%), other [[explosion]]/[[Artillery|ordnance]] (14%), [[airstrike]] (13%), [[accident]] (2%), unknown (2%). A copy of a [[death certificate]] was available for a high proportion of the reported deaths (92% of those households asked to produce one).<ref name=lancet2006>[[Lancet surveys of Iraq War casualties|2006 Lancet study]]. {{cite web

PLOS Medicine Study
|
The '''[[PLOS Medicine]]''' study's figure of approximately '''460,000''' excess deaths through the end of '''June 2011''' is based on household survey data including more than '''60%''' of deaths directly attributable to violence. The estimate is for all excess violent and nonviolent deaths. That also includes those due to increased lawlessness, degraded infrastructure, poorer healthcare, etc. 405,000 deaths (range of 48,000 to 751,000 using a 95% [[confidence interval]]) were estimated as excess deaths attributable to the conflict. They estimated at least 55,000 additional deaths occurred that the survey missed, as the families had migrated out of Iraq. The survey found that more than 60% of excess deaths were caused by violence, with the rest caused indirectly by the war, through degradation of infrastructure and similar causes. The survey notes that although car bombs received more significant press internationally, gunshot wounds were responsible for the majority (63%) of violent deaths. The study also estimated that 35% of violent deaths were attributed to the Coalition, and 32% to militias. Cardiovascular conditions accounted for about half (47%) of nonviolent deaths, chronic illnesses 11%, infant or childhood deaths other than injuries 12.4%, non-war injuries 11%, and cancer 8%.<ref name="Hagopian" />

=== Iraq Body Count project (IBC) ===
An independent British-American group, the IBC project compiles reported Iraqi civilian deaths resulting from the invasion and occupation, including those caused directly by coalition military action, the [[Iraqi insurgency (Iraq War)|Iraqi insurgency]], and those resulting from excess crime. The IBC maintains that the occupying authority has a responsibility to prevent these deaths under [[international law]].

Iraq Body Count project data shows that the type of attack that resulted in the most civilian deaths was execution after abduction or capture. These accounted for 33% of civilian deaths and were overwhelmingly carried out by unknown actors including insurgents, sectarian militias and criminals.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hicks |first1=Madelyn Hsiao-Rei |last2=Dardagan |first2=Hamit |last3=Serdán |first3=Gabriela Guerrero |last4=Bagnall |first4=Peter M. |last5=Sloboda |first5=John A. |last6=Spagat |first6=Michael |s2cid=37206162 |title=The Weapons That Kill Civilians — Deaths of Children and Noncombatants in Iraq, 2003–2008 |journal=New England Journal of Medicine |date=16 April 2009 |volume=360 |issue=16 |pages=1585–1588 |doi=10.1056/NEJMp0807240 |pmid=19369663 }}</ref>

The IBC project released a report detailing the deaths it recorded between March 2003 and March 2005<ref name="Dossier" /> in which it recorded 24,865 civilian deaths. The report says the U.S. and its allies were responsible for the largest share (37%) of the 24,865 deaths. The remaining deaths were attributed to anti-occupations forces (9%), crime (36%) and unknown agents (11%). It also lists the primary sources used by the media – mortuaries, medics, Iraqi officials, eyewitnesses, police, relatives, U.S.-coalition, journalists, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), friends/associates and other.

The Iraq Body Count (IBC) project has recorded the numbers of civilians killed in violence since the 2003 invasion of Iraq based on a "comprehensive survey of commercial media and NGO-based reports, along with official records that have been released into the public sphere. Reports range from specific, incident based accounts to figures from hospitals, morgues, and other documentary data-gathering agencies." The IBC was also given access to the [[WikiLeaks]] disclosures of the [[Iraq War Logs]].<ref name=iraqbodycountlogs/><ref>

In passive surveillance no special effort is made to find those deaths that go unreported. The volunteer staff collecting data for the IBC have risked criticism that their data are inherently biased because of scarcity or absence of independent verification, variation in original sources of information, and underestimation of mortality from violence... In research circles, random cross-sectional cluster sampling survey methods are deemed to be a more rigorous epidemiological method in conflict settings."<ref name="lancet2013"/>

=== People's Kifah ===

The Iraqi political party [[People's Kifah, or Struggle Against Hegemony]] (PK) said that its survey conducted between March and June 2003 throughout the non-Kurdish areas of Iraq tallied 36,533 civilians killed in those areas by June 2003. While detailed town-by-town totals were given by the PK spokesperson, details of methodology are very thin and raw data is not in the public domain.

Roughly 40 percent of Iraq's middle class is believed to have fled, the U.N. said. Most are fleeing systematic persecution and have no desire to return.

An estimated 331 school teachers were slain in the first four months of 2006, according to [[Human Rights Watch]], and at least 2,000 Iraqi doctors have been killed and 250 kidnapped since the 2003 U.S. invasion.<ref>Lochhead, Carolyn (January 16, 2007).

A study of U.S. veterans published in July 2004 in ''[[The New England Journal of Medicine]]'' on [[posttraumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD) and other mental disorders in Iraq and Afghanistan veterans found that 5 percent to 9.4 percent (depending on the strictness of the PTSD definition used) suffered from PTSD before deployment. After deployment, 6.2 percent to 19.9 percent suffered from PTSD. For the broad definition of PTSD that represents an increase of 10.5 percent (19.9 percent – 9.4 percent = 10.5 percent).

=== ''Nightline'' controversy ===
[[Ted Koppel]], host of [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[Nightline]]'', devoted his entire show on April 30, 2004, to reading the names of 721 of the 737 U.S. troops who had died thus far in Iraq. (The show had not been able to confirm the remaining sixteen names.) Claiming that the broadcast was “motivated by a political agenda designed to undermine the efforts of the United States in Iraq", the [[Sinclair Broadcast Group]] took the action of barring the seven ABC [[Network affiliate|network-affiliated stations]] it controls from airing the show. The decision to censor the broadcast drew criticism from both sides, including members of the armed forces, opponents of the war, [[MoveOn.org]], and most notably [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] [[John McCain]], who denounced the move as "unpatriotic" and "a gross disservice to the public".<ref>{{Cite news

''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''. Retrieved September 3, 2010.</ref> reported on a study published in the ''[[Archives of Internal Medicine]]''. About one third of the 103,788 veterans returning from the Iraq and Afghanistan wars seen at [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs]] facilities between September 30, 2001, and September 30, 2005, were diagnosed with mental illness or a psycho-social disorder, such as [[homelessness]] and marital problems, including [[domestic violence]]. More than half of those diagnosed, 56 percent, were suffering from more than one disorder. The most common combination was [[post-traumatic stress disorder]] and depression.

In January 2008, the U.S. Army reported that the rate of suicide among soldiers in 2007 was the highest since the Army started counting in 1980. There were 121 suicides in 2007, a 20-percent jump over the prior year. Also, there were around 2100 attempted suicides and self-injuries in 2007.<ref>[[Staff writer]] (January 31, 2008).

''Time'' magazine reported on June 5, 2008:

<blockquote>Data contained in the Army's fifth Mental Health Advisory Team report indicate that, according to an anonymous survey of U.S. troops taken last fall, about 12% of combat troops in Iraq and 17% of those in Afghanistan are taking [[prescription drug|prescription]] [[antidepressants]] or [[Hypnotic|sleeping pills]] to help them cope. ... About a third of soldiers in Afghanistan and Iraq say they can't see a mental-health professional when they need to. When the number of troops in Iraq surged by 30,000 last year, the number of Army mental-health workers remained the same – about 200 – making counseling and care even tougher to get.<ref name=time2008june>[[Mark Thompson (reporter)|Thompson, Mark]] (June 5, 2008).

In the same article ''Time'' also reported on some of the reasons for the prescription drug use:

<blockquote>That imbalance between seeing the price of war up close and yet not feeling able to do much about it, the survey suggests, contributes to feelings of "intense fear, helplessness or horror" that plant the seeds of mental distress. "A friend was liquefied in the driver's position on a tank, and I saw everything", was a typical comment. Another: "A huge f______ bomb blew my friend's head off like 50 meters from me." Such indelible scenes – and wondering when and where the next one will happen – are driving thousands of soldiers to take antidepressants, military psychiatrists say. It's not hard to imagine why.<ref name=time2008june /></blockquote>

Concern has been expressed by mental health professionals about the effects on the emotional health and development of returning veterans' infants and children, due to the increased rates of interpersonal violence, posttraumatic stress, depression, and substance abuse that have been reported among these veterans.<ref name="auto">{{cite journal

It added that, "Many more Iraqis are believed to have been killed but not counted because of serious lapses in recording deaths in the chaotic first year after the invasion, when there was no functioning Iraqi government, and continued spotty reporting nationwide since." Here is how the ''Times'' got its number: "The Baghdad morgue received 30,204 bodies from 2003 through mid-2006, while the Health Ministry said it had documented 18,933 deaths from 'military clashes' and 'terrorist attacks' from April 5, 2004, to June 1, 2006. Together, the toll reaches 49,137. However, samples obtained from local health departments in other provinces show an undercount that brings the total well beyond 50,000. The figure also does not include deaths outside Baghdad in the first year of the invasion."

It estimated 24,000 war-related violent deaths by May 2004 (with a 95 percent confidence interval from 18,000 to 29,000). This study did not attempt to measure what portion of its estimate was made up of civilians or combatants. It would include Iraqi military killed during the invasion, as well as "insurgents" or other fighters thereafter.<ref>{{cite web

The study did not attempt to measure how many of these were civilian, but the study's authors have said they believe that the "vast majority" were non-combatants, based on 7% of the casualties being women and 46% being children under the age of 15 (including Falluja data). To arrive at these excess death figures, a survey was taken from 988 Iraqi households in 33 clusters throughout Iraq, in which the residents were asked how many people lived there and how many births and deaths there had been since the war began. They then compared the death rate with the average from the 15 months before the war. Iraqis were found to be 1.5 times more likely to die from all causes after the invasion (rising from 0.5% to 0.79% per year) than in the 15 months preceding the war, producing an estimate of 98,000 excess deaths. This figure excluded data from one cluster in [[Falluja]], which was deemed too much of an outlier for inclusion in the national estimate. If it included data from Falluja, which showed a higher rate of violent deaths than the other 32 clusters combined, the increased death rate would be raised from 1.5 to 2.5-fold, violent deaths would be 58 times more likely with most of them due to air-strikes by coalition forces, and an additional 200,000 fatalities would be estimated.<ref>{{Cite news

The Iraqi non-governmental organisation, Iraqiyun, estimated 128,000 deaths from the invasion until July 2005.<ref name=lancet2006 /> A July 2005 [[United Press International]] (UPI) article said the number came from the chairman of the Iraqiyun humanitarian organization in Baghdad, Dr. Hatim al-'Alwani. He said 55 percent of those killed were women, and children aged 12 and under. The UPI article reported: "Iraqiyun obtained data from relatives and families of the deceased, as well as from Iraqi hospitals in all the country's provinces. The 128,000 figure only includes those whose relatives have been informed of their deaths and does not include those were abducted, assassinated or simply disappeared."<ref name=iraqiyun2005>[http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article9460.htm Iraqi civilian casualties] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111103180556/http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article9460.htm |date=November 3, 2011 }}.

=== ''Lancet'' (2006) ===
{{Main|Lancet surveys of Iraq War casualties}}
The [[Lancet surveys of Iraq War casualties|October 2006 Lancet study]] by Gilbert Burnham (of Johns Hopkins University) and co-authors<ref name=lancet2006 /><ref name=supplement /> estimated total excess deaths (civilian and non-civilian) related to the war of 654,965 excess deaths up to July 2006. The 2006 study was based on surveys conducted between May 20 and July 10, 2006. More households were surveyed than during the 2004 study, allowing for a 95% [[confidence interval]] of 392,979 to 942,636 excess Iraqi deaths. Those estimates were far higher than other available tallies at the time.<ref name=":13">{{Cite journal|last=Kahl|first=Colin H.|date=2007|title=In the Crossfire or the Crosshairs?

Burnham, Edward J. Mills, and Frederick M. Burkle noted that the IFHS's data indicated that Iraqi mortality increased by a factor of 1.9 following the invasion, compared to the factor of 2.4 found by Burnham et al., which translates to some 433,000 excess Iraqi deaths (violent and non-violent). Timothy R. Gulden considered it implausible that fewer than one-third of these excess deaths would have been violent in nature. Francisco J. Luquero and Rebecca F. Grais argued that the IFHS's lengthy survey and use of IBC data as a proxy for particularly dangerous areas likely resulted in an underestimate of violent mortality, while Gulden hypothesized that respondents may have been reluctant to report violent deaths to researchers working with the Iraqi government.<ref name="Correspondence">{{cite journal

Participants of the ORB survey were asked the following question: "How many members of your household, if any, have died as a result of the conflict in Iraq since 2003 (ie as a result of violence rather than a natural death such as old age)? Please note that I mean those who were actually living under your roof."

This ORB estimate has been strongly criticised as exaggerated and ill-founded in [[peer reviewed]] literature.<ref>[http://w4.ub.uni-konstanz.de/srm/article/viewArticle/2373 "Conflict Deaths in Iraq: A Methodological Critique of the ORB Survey Estimate"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719105821/http://w4.ub.uni-konstanz.de/srm/article/viewArticle/2373 |date=July 19, 2011 }} By Michael Spagat and Josh Dougherty</ref><ref name=":6">{{Cite document

=== Iraq Family Health Survey (IFHS, 2008) ===
The [[Iraq Family Health Survey]] published in 2008 in ''[[The New England Journal of Medicine]]'' surveyed 9,345 households across Iraq and was carried out in 2006 and 2007. It estimated 151,000 deaths due to violence (95% uncertainty range, 104,000 to 223,000) from March 2003 through June 2006.<ref name=":12" />

The study was done by the "Iraq Family Health Survey Study Group", a collaborative effort of six organizations: the Federal Ministry of Health, [[Baghdad]]; Kurdistan Ministry of Planning, [[Erbil]]; Kurdistan Ministry of Health, Erbil; Central Organization for Statistics and Information Technology, Baghdad; World Health Organization Iraq office, [[Amman]], Jordan; World Health Organization, [[Geneva]].<ref name=":12" />

=== The Associated Press and Health Ministry (2009) ===
In April 2009, the Associated Press reported that Iraq Health Ministry had recorded (via death certificates issued by hospitals and morgues) a total of 87,215 violent deaths of Iraqi citizens between January 1, 2005, and February 28, 2009. The number excludes thousands of missing persons and civilians whose deaths were unrecorded; the government official who provided the data told the AP that if included, the number of dead for that period would be 10 to 20 percent higher.<ref name=ap2009apr24nbc/><ref name=ap2009apr24/>

The Associated Press used the Health Ministry tally and other data (including counts of casualties for 2003–2004, and after March 1, 2009, from hospital sources and media reports, in major part the Iraq Body Count) to estimate that more than 110,600 Iraqis were killed from the start of the war to April 2009. Experts interviewed by the AP found this estimate to be credible and an "important baseline" although necessarily an estimate because of unrecorded deaths, especially in inaccessible areas. While mass graves discovered over time shed more light on deaths in the Iraq War, the AP noted that "how many remain will never be known."<ref name=ap2009apr24nbc/><ref name=ap2009apr24/>

=== ''PLOS Medicine'' (2013) ===
A 2013 study by Hagopian et al. in ''[[PLOS Medicine]]'' estimated that 461,000 Iraqis died as a result of the Iraq War.<ref name="Hagopian" /> The study used a similar methodology as the 2006 Lancet study and had the lead author of the 2006 study as one of the 12 authors.<ref name=":3">{{Cite news

A January 31, 2008 Perspective in the ''[[New England Journal of Medicine]]'' contains the following discussion of undercounting Iraqi civilian casualties in household surveys:

{{quote|... sometimes it was problematic or too dangerous to enter a cluster of households, which might well result in an undercount; data from the Iraq Body Count on the distribution of deaths among provinces were used to calculate estimates in these instances. If the clustering of violent deaths wasn't accurately captured, that could also increase uncertainty. The sampling frame was based on a 2004 count, but the population has been changing rapidly and dramatically because of sectarian violence, the flight of refugees, and overall population migration. Another source of bias in household surveys is underreporting due to the dissolution of some households after a death, so that no one remains to tell the former inhabitants' story.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Brownstein |first1=Catherine A. |last2=Brownstein |first2=John S. |title=Estimating Excess Mortality in Post-Invasion Iraq |journal=New England Journal of Medicine |date=31 January 2008 |volume=358 |issue=5 |pages=445–447 |doi=10.1056/NEJMp0709003 |pmid=18184951 }}</ref>}}

''[[The Washington Post]]'' noted in 2008 that

<blockquote>research has shown that household surveys typically miss 30 to 50 percent of deaths. One reason is that some families that have suffered violent deaths leave the survey area. ... Some people are kidnapped and disappear, and others turn up months or years later in mass graves. Some are buried or otherwise disposed of without being recorded. In particularly violent areas, local governments have effectively ceased to function, and there are ineffective channels for collecting and passing information between hospitals, morgues and the central government.<ref name=NewEstimate /></blockquote>

The [[Lancet surveys of Iraq War casualties|October 2006 ''Lancet'' study]]<ref name=lancet2006 /><ref name=supplement /> states:

<blockquote>Aside from [[Bosnia]], we can find no conflict situation where passive surveillance [used by the IBC] recorded more than 20% of the deaths measured by population-based methods [used in the ''Lancet'' studies]. In several outbreaks, disease and death recorded by facility-based methods underestimated events by a factor of ten or more when compared with population-based estimates. Between 1960 and 1990, newspaper accounts of political deaths in Guatemala correctly reported over 50% of deaths in years of low violence but less than 5% in years of highest violence.<ref name=lancet2006 /></blockquote>

The report describes no other specific examples except for this study of Guatemala.

[[Juan Cole]] wrote in October 2006 that even though heavy fighting could be observed, none of the Iraqi casualties in the skirmishes were reported on, which suggests undercounting.<ref name="juancole2006oct11">[[Juan Cole|Cole, Juan]] (October 11, 2006).

<blockquote>Of course, in conditions of active rebellion, the safer areas accessible to Western reporters are likely to be those under US/Coalition control, where deaths are, in turn, likely to be due to insurgent attacks. Areas of insurgent control, which are likely to be subject to US and Iraqi government attack, for example most of [[Al Anbar Governorate|Anbar]] province, are simply off-limits to these reporters. Thus, the realities of reporting imply that reporters will be witness to a larger fraction of deaths due to insurgents and a lesser proportion of deaths due to US and Iraqi government forces.</blockquote>

The article further reports:

<blockquote>The finding confirmed a September 8 McClatchy Newspapers report that U.S. officials excluded scores of people killed in car bombings and mortar attacks from tabulations measuring the results of a drive to reduce violence in Baghdad.

From the ISG report itself:

<blockquote>A murder of an Iraqi is not necessarily counted as an attack. If we cannot determine the source of a sectarian attack, that assault does not make it into the database.

=== Casualties caused by criminal and political violence ===
[[File:Army.mil-2007-04-23-104120.jpg|thumb|U.S. Army medics lift a wounded Iraqi police officer into an ambulance (March 2007)]]
In May 2004, Associated Press completed a survey<ref name="5,500 Iraqis" /> of the morgues in [[Baghdad]] and surrounding provinces. The survey tallied violent deaths from May 1, 2003, when President [[George W. Bush|Bush]] declared an end to major combat operations, through April 30, 2004.

From the AP article:

<blockquote>In Baghdad, a city of about 5.6&nbsp;million, 4,279 people were recorded killed in the 12 months through April 30, [2004], according to figures provided by Kais Hassan, director of statistics at Baghdad's [[Medicolegal Institute]], which administers the city's morgues. "Before the war, there was a strong government, strong security. There were a lot of police on the streets and there were no illegal weapons", he said during an AP reporter's visit to the morgue. "Now there are few controls. There is crime, revenge killings, so much violence." The figure does not include most people killed in big terrorist bombings, Hassan said. The cause of death in such cases is obvious so bodies are usually not taken to the morgue, but given directly to victims' families. Also, the bodies of killed fighters from groups like the al-Mahdi Army are rarely taken to morgues.</blockquote>

Accidental trauma deaths from car accidents, falls, etc. are not included in the numbers. The article reports that the numbers translate to 76 killings per 100,000 people in Baghdad, compared to 39 in [[Bogotá]], Colombia, 7.5 in [[New York City]], and 2.4 in neighboring Jordan. The article states that there were 3.0 killings per 100,000 people in Baghdad in 2002 (the year before the war). Morgues surveyed in other parts of Iraq also reported large increases in the number of homicides. [[Karbala]], south of Baghdad, increased from an average of one homicide per month in 2002 to an average of 55 per month in the year following the invasion; in [[Tikrit]], north of Baghdad, where there were no homicides in 2002, the rate had grown to an average of 17 per month; in the northern province of [[Kirkuk]], the rate had increased from 3 per month in 2002 to 34 per month in the survey period.<ref name="5,500 Iraqis" />
