'''Robert Joseph Dole''' (born July 22, 1923) is an American retired politician, statesman,<ref name="auto2">{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2018/01/17/578568074/sen-bob-dole-to-receive-congressional-gold-medal|title=Bob Dole To Receive Congressional Gold Medal|work=NPR.org|access-date=January 17, 2018|language=en}}</ref>  and attorney who represented [[Kansas]] in the [[U.S House of Representatives]] from 1961 to 1969 and in the [[U.S. Senate]] from 1969 to 1996, serving as the [[Republican Leader of the United States Senate]] from 1985 until 1996. He was the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] presidential nominee in the [[1996 United States presidential election|1996 election]] and the party's vice presidential nominee in the [[1976 United States presidential election|1976 election]].

Born in [[Russell, Kansas]], Dole established a legal career in Russell after serving with distinction in the [[United States Army]] during [[World War II]]. After a stint as [[Russell County, Kansas|Russell County]] Attorney, he won election to the House of Representatives in 1960. In 1968, Dole was elected to the Senate, where he served as chairman of the [[Republican National Committee]] from 1971 to 1973 and chairman of the [[Senate Finance Committee]] from 1981 to 1985. He led the Senate Republicans from 1985 to his resignation in 1996, and served as Senate Majority Leader from 1985 to 1987 and from 1995 to 1996. In his role as Republican leader, he helped defeat President [[Bill Clinton]]'s [[Clinton health care plan of 1993|health care plan]].
 
President [[Gerald Ford]] chose Dole as his running mate in the 1976 election after Vice President [[Nelson Rockefeller]] withdrew from seeking a full term. Ford was defeated by Democrat [[Jimmy Carter]] in the general election. Dole sought the Republican presidential nomination in [[Republican Party presidential primaries, 1980|1980]] but quickly dropped out of the race. He experienced more success in the [[Republican Party presidential primaries, 1988|1988 Republican primaries]] but was defeated by Vice President [[George H. W. Bush]]. Dole won the Republican nomination in [[Republican Party presidential primaries, 1996|1996]] and selected [[Jack Kemp]] as his running mate. The Republican ticket lost in the general election to Bill Clinton, making Dole the first unsuccessful major party nominee for both president and vice president. He resigned from the Senate during the 1996 campaign and did not seek public office again after the election.

Though he retired from public office, Dole has remained active in public life after 1996. He appeared in numerous commercials and television programs and served on various councils. In 2012, Dole unsuccessfully advocated Senate ratification of the [[Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]]. He initially supported [[Jeb Bush]] in the [[Republican Party presidential primaries, 2016|2016 Republican primaries]], but later became the only former Republican presidential nominee to endorse [[Donald Trump]], after Trump clinched the Republican nomination. Dole is currently a member of the advisory council of the [[Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation]] and special counsel at the Washington, D.C., office of [[law firm]] [[Alston & Bird]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.victimsofcommunism.org/about/nationaladvisors.php|title=National Advisory Council|publisher=[[Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610171740/http://www.victimsofcommunism.org/about/nationaladvisors.php|archivedate=June 10, 2011|accessdate=May 20, 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> On January 17, 2018, Dole was awarded the [[Congressional Gold Medal]]. He is married to former U.S. Senator [[Elizabeth Dole]] of [[North Carolina]].

==Early life and education==
Dole was born on July 22, 1923, in [[Russell, Kansas]], the son of Bina M. (née Talbott; 1904–1983) and Doran Ray Dole (1901–1975).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wargs.com/political/dole.html|title=Ancestry of Robert Dole (b. 1923)|publisher=Wargs.com|accessdate=June 17, 2010}}</ref> His  father, who had moved the family to Russell shortly before Robert was born, earned money by running a small creamery. One of Dole's father's customers was the father of his future Senate colleague [[Arlen Specter]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.law.upenn.edu/blogs/news/archives/2011/03/qa_with_senator_arlen_specter.html|title=Q&A with Senator Arlen Specter (Penn Law News & Stories)|publisher=Law.upenn.edu|date=March 3, 2011|accessdate=April 8, 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110317045337/http://www.law.upenn.edu/blogs/news/archives/2011/03/qa_with_senator_arlen_specter.html|archivedate=March 17, 2011}}</ref> The Doles lived in a house at 1035 North Maple in Russell and it remained his official residence throughout his political career.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,984325-2,00.html|work=Time|title=Campaign '96: Russell, Kansas: You Can Go Home Again|date=April 1, 1996}}</ref>

Dole graduated from Russell High School in the spring of 1941<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usd407.org/rhs/Alumni/1941.htm|title=Hebron High School 1914 Alumni|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050530131659/http://www.usd407.org/rhs/Alumni/1941.htm|archive-date=May 30, 2005}}</ref> and enrolled at the [[University of Kansas]] the following fall. Dole had been a star high school athlete in Russell, and Kansas basketball coach [[Phog Allen]] traveled to Russell to recruit him to play for the [[Kansas Jayhawks men's basketball|Jayhawks basketball team]]. While at KU, Dole played for the basketball team, the track team, and the football team. In football, Dole played at the [[End (American football)|end]] position, earning [[varsity letters]] in 1942 and 1944. In 1942 he was a teammate of former Tennessee Titans owner [[Bud Adams]], Adams's only season playing football at Kansas.<ref>{{cite web|title=KU Football rosters 1940-1949|url=http://kuathletics.com/documents/2016/1/11//1940_49_Rosters.pdf?id=4066|website=KUAthletics.com|access-date=April 5, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180406040506/http://kuathletics.com/documents/2016/1/11//1940_49_Rosters.pdf?id=4066|archive-date=April 6, 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref> While in college, Dole joined the [[Kappa Sigma]] fraternity, and in 1970 was bestowed with the Fraternity's "Man of the Year" honor.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kappasigma.org/man-of-the-year/|title=Man of The Year}}</ref> Dole's collegiate studies were interrupted by [[World War II]], when he enlisted in the [[United States Army]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/3332/text|title=Text - H.R.3332 - 115th Congress (2017-2018): Bob Dole Congressional Gold Medal Act|last=Lynn|first=Jenkins|date=July 20, 2017|website=www.congress.gov|language=en|access-date=June 6, 2018}}</ref>

Dole attended the [[University of Arizona]] from 1948 to 1949, before transferring to [[Washburn University]] and graduating with both undergraduate and law degrees in 1952.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://history.house.gov/People/Detail/12331|title=DOLE, Robert Joseph {{!}} US House of Representatives: History, Art & Archives|website=history.house.gov|language=en|access-date=July 10, 2018}}</ref>

==World War II and recovery==
In 1942, Dole joined the United States Army's Enlisted Reserve Corps to fight in World War II, becoming a [[US Second Lieutenant|second lieutenant]] in the Army's [[U.S. 10th Mountain Division|10th Mountain Division]].
In April 1945, while engaged in combat near [[Castel d'Aiano]] in the Apennine mountains southwest of [[Bologna]], Italy, Dole was seriously wounded by German machine gun fire, being struck in his upper back and right arm. As Lee Sandlin describes, when fellow soldiers saw the extent of his injuries, all they thought they could do was to "give him the largest dose of [[morphine]] they dared and write an 'M' for 'morphine' on his forehead in his own blood, so that nobody else who found him would give him a second, fatal dose."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.leesandlin.com/articles/LosingTheWar.htm|title="Losing the War" by Lee Sandlin |publisher=Leesandlin.com|accessdate=June 17, 2010}}</ref>

Dole was transported to the United States, where his recovery was slow, interrupted by blood clots and a life-threatening infection. After large doses of [[penicillin]] were not successful, he overcame the infection with the administration of [[streptomycin]], which at the time was still an [[experimental drug]].<ref>Dole, B. ''One Soldier's Story'', pp. 202–04.</ref> He remained despondent, "not ready to accept the fact that my life would be changed forever." He was encouraged to see [[Hampar Kelikian]], an [[orthopedist]] in Chicago who had been working with veterans returning from war. Although during their first meeting Kelikian told Dole that he would never be able to recover fully, the encounter changed Dole's outlook on life, who years later wrote of Kelikian, a survivor of the [[Armenian Genocide]], "Kelikian inspired me to focus on what I had left and what I could do with it, rather than complaining what had been lost." Dr. K, as Dole later came to affectionately call him, operated on him seven times, free of charge, and had, in Dole's words, "an impact on my life second only to my family."<ref>{{cite book|last=Bobelian|first=Michael|title=Children of Armenia: A Forgotten Genocide and the Century-long Struggle for Justice|publisher=Simon & Schuster|location=New York|year=2009|pages=164–65|isbn=978-1-4165-5725-8}}</ref>

Dole recovered from his wounds at the Percy Jones Army Hospital. This complex of federal buildings, no longer a hospital, is now named [[Hart-Dole-Inouye Federal Center]] in honor of three patients who became United States Senators: Dole, [[Philip Hart]] and [[Daniel Inouye]]. Dole was decorated three times, receiving two [[Purple Heart]]s for his injuries, and the [[Bronze Star Medal|Bronze Star]] with [["V" Device]] for valor for his attempt to assist a downed radioman. The injuries left him with limited mobility in his right arm and [[anaphia|numbness]] in his left arm. He minimizes the effect in public by keeping a pen in his right hand.<ref>{{cite news|author=Katharine Q. Seelye|title=War Wounds Shape Life, and Politics, for Dole|date=April 14, 1996|journal=The New York Times}}</ref>

==Political career==
Dole ran for office for the first time in 1950 and was elected to the [[Kansas House of Representatives]], serving a two-year term.<ref>{{cite web|title=Dillard to Dyck, Kansas Legislators Past and Present, State Library of Kansas|url=http://www.kslib.info/government-information/legislative-information/kansas-legislators-past-and-present/dillard-to-dyck.html|accessdate=March 2, 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131113211645/http://www.kslib.info/government-information/legislative-information/kansas-legislators-past-and-present/dillard-to-dyck.html|archivedate=November 13, 2013}}</ref> During his term in the Kansas House of Representatives he served on the following committees: Assessment and Taxation, Gas and Oil, Military Affairs and Soldiers Compensation.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.b2945490&view=1up&seq=385 |title=1951 Kansas House Journal |publisher=State of Kansas |date= |accessdate=December 28, 2019}}</ref> In 1952, he became the County Attorney of [[Russell County, Kansas|Russell County]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://partners.nytimes.com/library/politics/dole-kansas.html|title=A Political Life: Dole's Kansas Years|website=partners.nytimes.com|access-date=June 6, 2018}}</ref> In 1960, Dole was elected to the [[United States House of Representatives]] from Kansas' 6th Congressional District.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/05/19/us/a-political-life-the-kansas-years-on-the-kansas-prairie-the-window-to-dole.html|title=A POLITICAL LIFE: The Kansas Years;On the Kansas Prairie, the Window to Dole|last=Kolbert|first=Elizabeth|date=May 19, 1996|work=The New York Times|access-date=June 6, 2018|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> After his first term, Kansas lost a congressional district, and most of Dole's district was merged with the neighboring 2nd District to form a new [[Kansas's 1st congressional district|1st District]], encompassing much of central and western Kansas. Dole was elected from this merged district in 1962 and was reelected two more times.

During his tenure in the House, Dole voted in favor of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964|Civil Rights Acts of 1964]] and [[Civil Rights Act of 1968|1968]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/88-1964/h128|title=H.R. 7152.

In 1968, Dole defeated [[Governor of Kansas|Kansas Governor]] [[William H. Avery (politician)|William H. Avery]] for the Republican nomination for the [[United States Senate]] to succeed retiring Senator [[Frank Carlson]], subsequently being elected. Dole was re-elected in 1974, 1980, 1986, and 1992, before resigning on June 11, 1996, to focus on his [[U.S. presidential election, 1996|Presidential campaign]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.politico.com/story/2009/06/dole-resigns-from-senate-to-focus-on-presidential-bid-june-11-1996-023593|title=Dole resigns from Senate to focus on presidential bid, June 11, 1996|work=POLITICO|access-date=June 6, 2018|language=en}}</ref>

While in the Senate, Dole served as chairman of the [[Republican National Committee]] from 1971–73, the ranking Republican on the [[U.S. Senate Committee on Agriculture|Agriculture Committee]] from 1975–78, and the chairman of the [[U.S. Senate Committee on Finance|Finance Committee]] from 1981–85.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.agriculture.senate.gov/newsroom/press/release/senator-roberts-makes-history-becoming-top-republican-on-senate-agriculture-committee|title=Senator Roberts Makes History, Becoming Top Republican on Senate Agriculture Committee {{!}} The United States Senate Committee On Agriculture, Nutrition & Forestry|website=www.agriculture.senate.gov|language=en|access-date=June 6, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/al-eisele/bob-dole-interview_b_1260703.html|title=Bob Dole: Still a Man to be Reckoned With|last=Eisele|first=Al|date=February 7, 2012|website=Huffington Post|language=en-US|access-date=June 6, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.politico.com/story/2015/11/bob-dole-elected-as-senate-republican-leader-nov-28-1984-216193|title=Bob Dole elected Senate Republican leader, Nov. 28, 1984|work=POLITICO|access-date=June 6, 2018|language=en}}</ref>

Over time in the Senate, Dole was seen by some as having a moderate voting record.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/slideshow/soldier-statesman-bob-dole-s-life-public-service-n837896|title=From soldier to statesman: Bob Dole's life of public service|work=NBC News|access-date=June 6, 2018|language=en-US}}</ref> During the 1970s, he partnered with Senator [[George McGovern]] to help pass legislation making [[Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program|food stamps]] more accessible.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/21/opinion/food-stamp-politics.html|title=Opinion {{!}} Food Stamp Politics|last=Samuels|first=Dorothy|date=May 20, 2013|work=The New York Times|access-date=June 6, 2018|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> In 1982, ''[[The New York Times]]'' referred to Dole as changing from "hard-line conservative" to "mainstream Republicanism".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/12/12/magazine/the-clout-of-the-new-bob-dole.html?pagewanted=all|title=THE CLOUT OF THE 'NEW' BOB DOLE|last=Clark|first=Timothy B.|access-date=June 6, 2018|language=en}}</ref>

In 1976, Dole ran unsuccessfully for vice president on a ticket headed by President [[Gerald Ford]]. Incumbent Vice President [[Nelson Rockefeller]] had announced the previous November his retirement from politics rather than run for a full term as vice president, and Dole was chosen as Ford's running mate. Dole stated during the Vice Presidential debate with [[Walter Mondale]], "I figured it up the other day: If we added up the killed and wounded in Democrat wars in this century, it would be about 1.6 million Americans&nbsp;— enough to fill the city of Detroit".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/politics/july-dec04/retro_10-5.html|title=Online NewsHour: Previous Vice Presidential Debates Lend Perspective to Edwards, Cheney Face-Off|date=October 5, 2004|publisher=Pbs.org|accessdate=June 17, 2010}}</ref>

Dole ran for the [[1980 Republican Party presidential primaries|1980 Republican presidential nomination]], eventually won by [[Ronald Reagan]]. Despite Dole's national exposure from the '76 campaign, he finished behind Reagan, [[George H.W.

However, Bush would defeat Dole in the New Hampshire primary a week later. After the returns had come in on the night of that primary, Dole appeared to lose his temper in a television interview with Tom Brokaw, saying Bush should "stop lying about my record", in response to a Bush commercial which accused Dole of "straddling" on taxes.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/03/17/us/bush-vs-dole-behind-the-turnaround.html?pagewanted=all|title=Bush vs. Dole: Behind the Turnaround|last=Dionne.|first=Gerald M.

Despite a key endorsement by Senator [[Strom Thurmond]], Dole was defeated by Bush again in [[South Carolina]] in early March. Several days later, every southern state voted for Bush in a [[Super Tuesday]] sweep. This was followed by another loss in Illinois, which persuaded Dole to withdraw from the race.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/03/30/us/bush-nomination-seems-assured-as-dole-leaves-republican-race.html|title=Bush Nomination Seems Assured As Dole Leaves Republican Race|last=Times|first=Bernard Weinraub and Special To the New York|access-date=June 6, 2018|language=en}}</ref>

{{Split section|Bob Dole 1996 presidential campaign|date=March 2020}}
The Republicans [[Republican Revolution|took control]] of both the Senate and House of Representatives in the [[1994 United States elections|1994 mid-term elections]], due to the fallout from President [[Bill Clinton]]'s policies including his [[Hillarycare|health care plan]], and Dole became Senate Majority Leader for the second time. In October 1995, a year before the presidential election, Dole and Speaker of the House [[Newt Gingrich]] led the Republican-controlled Congress to pass a [[Appropriations bill (United States)|spending bill]] that President Clinton vetoed, leading to the [[United States federal government shutdowns of 1995–1996|federal government shutdown from 1995–96]]. On November 13, Republican and Democratic leaders, including Vice President [[Al Gore]], [[Dick Armey]], and Dole, met to try to resolve the budget and were unable to reach an agreement.<ref name=MyLife>

I shot back, saying I would never allow their budget to become law, 'even if I drop to 5 percent in the polls. If you want your budget, you'll have to get someone else to sit in this chair!' Not surprisingly, we didn't make a deal." - Bill Clinton, describing the mood of the discussion (''My Life'', p. 681).</ref> Due to Dole's need to campaign for the Republican presidential nomination, he wanted to solve the [[budget crisis]] in January 1996 despite the willingness of other Republicans to continue the shutdown unless their demands were met. In particular, as Gingrich and Dole had been seen as potential rivals for the 1996 presidential nomination, they had a tense working relationship.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/03/us/politics/03boehner.html|work=The New York Times|first=Jennifer|last=Steinhauer|title=John Boehner, New House Speaker, Will Face Tough Challenges|date=November 3, 2010}}</ref> The shutdown was cited as having a role in Clinton's successful 1996 re-election by Clinton aide [[George Stephanopoulos]].<ref name="George Stephanopoulos 2000. pp. 406-407">Stephanopoulos, George.

The popularity of the incumbent president, [[Bill Clinton]], had improved greatly from 1994 to 1996 thanks to a booming economy as well as winning public opinion in the 1995 budget shutdown, so Clinton and vice president [[Al Gore]] faced no serious opposition in the Democratic primaries.<ref name="oregonlive.com">{{Cite web|url=https://www.oregonlive.com/history/2016/08/bob_dole_backs_donald_trump_bu.html|title=Bob Dole backs Donald Trump, but 20 years ago his campaign rejected embryonic Trumpism|first=Douglas Perry &#124; The|last=Oregonian/OregonLive|date=August 25, 2016|website=oregonlive.com}}</ref> A few months before his death in April 1994, [[Richard Nixon]] warned Dole "If the economy's good, you're not going to beat Clinton."<ref name="auto">{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/bob-dole-on-life-after-losing-the-1996-presidential-election/2012/09/28/eaef4102-f78e-11e1-8398-0327ab83ab91_story.html|title=Bob Dole on life after losing the 1996 presidential election|first=Bob|last=Dole|date=September 30, 2012|website=The Washington Post}}</ref> Dole was the early front runner for the GOP nomination in the [[1996 United States presidential election|1996 presidential race]]. At least eight candidates ran for the nomination. Dole was expected to win the nomination against underdog candidates such as the more conservative Senator [[Phil Gramm]] of Texas and more moderate Senator [[Arlen Specter]] of [[Pennsylvania]]. [[Pat Buchanan]] upset Dole in the early New Hampshire primary, however, with Dole finishing second and former Tennessee governor [[Lamar Alexander]] finishing third. Speechwriter [[Kerry Tymchuk]] remarked "Dole was on the ropes because he wasn't conservative enough".<ref name="oregonlive.com"/>

Dole eventually won the nomination, becoming the oldest first-time presidential nominee at the age of 73 years, 1 month (President Ronald Reagan was 73 years, 6 months in 1984, for his second presidential nomination), and would've succeeded Reagan as the oldest president to take office, as well as the first [[Kansas]] native to become president (as [[Dwight Eisenhower]] was born in [[Texas]]). Dole found the initial draft of the acceptance speech written by [[Mark Helprin]] too hardline, so Kerry Tymchuk who was part of the "'Let Dole be Dole' crowd" revised the speech to cover the 'themes of honor, decency and straight talk. It included the following line, a swat at the all-or-nothing rookie Republicans who had been swept into Congress in the 1994 midterm GOP wave: "In politics honorable compromise is no sin. It is what protects us from absolutism and intolerance"'.<ref name="oregonlive.com"/>

In his acceptance speech, Dole stated, "Let me be the bridge to an America that only the unknowing call myth. Let me be the bridge to a time of tranquillity, faith, and confidence in action,"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.portlandpublishinghouse.com/bridge.html|title=1996 Bob Dole acceptance speech|publisher=Portlandpublishinghouse.com|accessdate=June 17, 2010}}</ref> to which incumbent president [[Bill Clinton]] responded, "We do not need to build a bridge to the past, we need to build a bridge to the future."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/08/31/opinion/mr-clinton-s-bridge.html|title=Mr. Clinton's Bridge|work=The New York Times|date=August 31, 1996|accessdate=June 17, 2010}}</ref>

Dole was the first sitting Senate Party Leader to receive his party's nomination for president. He hoped to use his long experience in Senate procedures to maximize publicity from his rare positioning as Senate Majority Leader against an incumbent president but was stymied by Senate Democrats. On June 11, 1996, Dole resigned his seat to focus on the campaign, saying he had "nowhere to go but the [[White House]] or home".<ref>{{cite news|last=Berke|first=Richard L.|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/05/16/us/politics-overview-dole-says-he-will-leave-senate-focus-presidential-race.html?pagewanted=all|title=New York Times, May 16, 1996: Dole says he will leave Senate to focus on presidential race|work=The New York Times|date=May 16, 1996|accessdate=June 17, 2010}}</ref>

As told in the Doles' joint biography, ''Unlimited Partners'', speechwriter and biographer Kerry Tymchuk wrote "that he was going to make a statement. He was going to risk it all for the White House. He knew his time as leader was over. It would have been tough to come back [to the Senate as leader] if he lost in November. He knew it was time to move up or move out."<ref name="oregonlive.com"/>

[[File:Dole-Kemp Rally at UB 1, 1996.jpg|left|thumb|Dole–Kemp campaign rally at the [[State University of New York at Buffalo]]]]

Dole promised a 15% across-the-board reduction in [[income tax]] rates and made former Congressman and [[supply-side economics|supply side]] advocate [[Jack Kemp]] his running mate for vice president. Dole found himself criticized from both the left and the right within the Republican Party over the convention platform, one of the major issues being the inclusion of the [[Human Life Amendment]]. Clinton framed the narrative against Dole early, painting him as a mere clone of unpopular then-House Speaker [[Newt Gingrich]], warning America that Dole would work in concert with the Republican Congress to slash popular social programs, like [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] and [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]], dubbed by Clinton as "Dole-Gingrich".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/10/07/us/clinton-and-dole-face-to-face-spar-over-medicare-and-taxes.html|work=The New York Times|title=Clinton And Dole, Face To Face, Spar Over Medicare And Taxes|first=Richard L.|last=Berke|date=October 7, 1996|accessdate=April 26, 2010}}</ref> Dole's tax-cut plan found itself under attack from the White House, who said it would "blow a hole in the deficit".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/1996/36/b34915.htm|title=Medicare, taxes and Dole: a talk with the president|work=Bloomberg BusinessWeek|date=June 14, 1997|accessdate=June 17, 2010}}</ref>

With the infancy of the Internet, Dole-Kemp was the first presidential campaign to set up a website, edging out Clinton-Gore, which was set up by Arizona State college students Rob Kubasko and Vince Salvato.<ref name="oregonlive.com"/> The Dole-Kemp presidential campaign page is still live as of 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/02/1996/470106/|title=The First Campaign Websites|last=LaFrance|first=Adrienne|date=February 19, 2016|website=The Atlantic|language=en-US|access-date=February 15, 2019}}</ref><ref>http://www.dolekemp96.org</ref>

Concerns over Dole's age and lagging campaign were exemplified by a memorable incident on September 18, 1996. At a rally in [[Chico, California]], he was reaching down to shake the hand of a supporter, when the railing on the stage gave way and he tumbled four feet. While only minorly injured in the fall, "the televised image of his painful grimace underscored the age difference between him and Clinton" and proved an ominous sign for Republican hopes of retaking the White House.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1996-09-19/news/9609181328_1_bob-dole-grand-canyon-slogan|title=Dole Falls Off Stage At Rally, Bounces Back|work=Orlando Sentinel}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/general-election-2015/politics-blog/11576072/Thought-Ed-Milibands-stumble-was-bad-These-politicians-had-much-worse-falls.html|title=Thought Ed Miliband's stumble was bad?

During the latter half of October 1996, Dole made a campaign appearance with [[Heather Whitestone]], the first deaf Miss America, where both of them signed "I love you" to the crowd. Around that time, Dole and his advisers knew that they would lose the election, but in the last four days of the campaign they went on the "96-hour victory tour" to help Republican Congressional candidates.<ref name="auto1">{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/11/05/politics/crowley-losing-side/index.html|title=Crowley: It's the losing campaigns I remember most – CNNPolitics.com|publisher=CNN|date=November 5, 2012}}</ref>

Dole lost, as pundits had long expected, to incumbent President [[Bill Clinton]] in the 1996 election. Clinton won in a 379–159 [[United States Electoral College|Electoral College]] landslide, capturing 49.2% of the vote against Dole's 40.7% and [[Ross Perot]]'s 8.4%.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1996/elections/natl.exit.poll/index1.html|publisher=CNN|accessdate=April 26, 2010|title=Presidential Election Exit Poll Results – Part 1}}</ref> As Richard Nixon had predicted to Dole a few months before his death in April 1994, Clinton was able to ride a booming economy to a second term in the White House.<ref name="auto"/>

Dole is the last World War II veteran to have been the presidential nominee of a major party. During the campaign, Dole's advanced age was brought up, with critics stating that he was too old to be president.

In his election night concession speech, Dole remarked "I was thinking on the way down in the elevator – tomorrow will be the first time in my life I don't have anything to do."<ref name="auto1"/> Dole later wrote "I was wrong. Seventy-two hours after conceding the election, I was swapping wisecracks with [[David Letterman]] on his late-night show".<ref name="auto"/> During the immediate aftermath of his 1996 loss to Clinton, Dole recalled that his critics thought that "I didn't loosen up enough, I didn't show enough leg. They said I was too serious . . . It takes several months to stop fretting about it and move on. But I did." Dole remarked that his decisive defeat to Clinton made it easier for him to be "magnanimous". On his decision to leave politics for good after the 1996 presidential election campaign, despite his guaranteed stature as a former Senate leader, Dole stated "People were urging [me] to be a hatchet man against Clinton for the next four years. I couldn't see the point. Maybe after all those partisan fights, you look for more friendships. One of the nice things I've discovered is that when you're out of politics, you have more credibility with the other side . . . And you're out among all kinds of people, and that just doesn't happen often for an ex-president; he doesn't have the same freedom. So it hasn't been all bad."<ref name="washingtonpost.com">{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A27100-2005Feb15.html|title=What Might Have Been|website=The Washington Post}}</ref>

[[File:Bob Dole VE Day 60th Anniversary.jpg|thumb|right|Dole speaking at the 60th Anniversary of [[VE Day]], 2005]]

The 1996 presidential election, despite ending in a loss, opened up numerous opportunities for Dole owing in part to his sense of humor. He has engaged in a career of writing, consulting, public speaking, and television appearances. Dole was the first defeated presidential nominee to become a political celebrity.<ref name="washingtonpost.com"/>

He became a television commercial spokesman for such products as [[sildenafil|Viagra]], [[Visa (credit card)|Visa]], [[Dunkin' Donuts]] and [[Pepsi-Cola]] (with [[Britney Spears]]), and as an occasional political commentator on the interview program ''[[Larry King Live]]'', and has been a guest a number of times on [[Comedy Central]]'s [[news satire|satirical news]] program, ''[[The Daily Show with Jon Stewart]]''. Dole was, for a short time, a commentator opposite [[Bill Clinton]] on [[CBS]]'s ''[[60 Minutes]]''. Dole guest-starred as himself on [[NBC]]'s [[Brooke Shields]] sitcom ''[[Suddenly Susan]]'' in January 1997 (shortly after losing the presidential election). He also made a cameo appearance on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', parodying himself in November 1996.<ref name="auto"/>

From 1998 to 2002, Dole was head of the [[Federal City Council]], a group of business, civic, education, and other leaders interested in economic development in Washington, D.C.<ref>{{cite news|last=Roman|first=Dave|title=Dole Remains a Winner Despite Most-Notable Loss|work=Florida Times-Union|date=December 3, 1997|accessdate=December 10, 2013|url=http://jacksonville.com/tu-online/stories/120397/2b1Roman.html|postscript=none}}; {{cite news|last=Trescott|first=Jacqueline|title=Music Museum Proposed for D.C.|work=The Washington Post|date=July 9, 1998|page=B1|postscript=none}}; {{cite news|last=Resnick|first=Amy B.|title=D.C.

After leaving office, Dole joined the Washington, D.C. firm Verner, Liipfert, Bernhard, McPherson and Hand, where he was a registered [[lobbyist]] on behalf of foreign governments (including [[Kosovo]], [[Taiwan]], and [[Slovenia]]); the [[American Society of Anesthesiologists]]; [[Tyco International|Tyco]]; and the [[Chocolate Industry Coalition]].<ref name="Sarasohn">Judy Sarasohn, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/2003/02/12/dole-to-join-law-firm-based-in-atlanta/ed69d160-6218-46f9-93b3-00c40d13b5f0/ Dole to Join Law Firm Based in Atlanta], ''The Washington Post'' (February 12, 2003).</ref> In 2003, after Verner, Liipfert was acquired by [[Piper Rudnick]],<ref name="Sarasohn"/><ref name="ABC">[http://www.bizjournals.com/atlanta/stories/2003/02/10/daily33.html Bob Dole to join Alston & Bird], ''Atlanta Business Chronicle'' (February 12, 2003).</ref> Dole joined the Washington, D.C.

The [[Robert J. Dole Institute of Politics]], housed on the University of Kansas campus in [[Lawrence, Kansas]], was established to bring bipartisanship back to politics. The Institute, which opened in July 2003 to coincide with Dole's 80th birthday, has featured such notable speakers as former President Bill Clinton and former New York City Mayor [[Rudy Giuliani]].

Dole's legacy also includes a commitment to combating [[hunger]] both in the United States and around the globe. In addition to numerous domestic programs, and along with former Senator [[George McGovern]] (D-South Dakota), Dole created an international school lunch program through the [[George McGovern-Robert Dole International Food for Education and Child Nutrition Program]], which, funded largely through the Congress, helps fight child hunger and poverty by providing nutritious meals to children in schools in developing countries.<ref name="nyt-label">{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/07/23/us/public-lives-a-mcgovern-liberal-who-s-content-to-stick-to-the-label.html | title=Public Lives: A McGovern Liberal Who's Content to Stick to the Label | author=Becker, Elizabeth | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=July 23, 2001 | authorlink=Elizabeth Becker}}</ref><ref name="tln011201">{{cite news | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=7YIfAAAAIBAJ&pg=4712,1934808&dq=george+mcgovern+ambassador+food+bush&hl=en | title=Bush asks McGovern to keep post | newspaper=[[The Tuscaloosa News]] | date=January 12, 2001 | page=2A}}</ref> This internationally popular program would go on to provide more than 22 million meals to children in 41 countries in its first eight years.<ref name="lodi">{{cite news | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=XwRSAAAAIBAJ&pg=4958,1198025&dq=mcgovern+dole+food+for+nutrition+and&hl=en | title=Farm bill has little aid for needy children abroad | agency=[[Associated Press]] | newspaper=[[Lodi News-Sentinel]] | date=May 14, 2008 | page=18}}</ref><ref name="ap-prize">{{cite news | url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/education/2008-10-14-world-food-prize_N.htm | title=Dole, McGovern school program awarded World Food Prize | author=Jackson, Henry C. | agency=[[Associated Press]] | newspaper=[[USA Today]] | date=October 14, 2008}}</ref>  It has since led to greatly increased global interest in and support for school-feeding programs—which benefit girls and young women, in particular—and won McGovern and Dole the 2008 [[World Food Prize]].<ref name="ap-prize"/>

In 2004, on the [[Larry King]] show, Dole had a heated exchange with Democratic presidential primary candidate [[Wesley Clark]] in which Dole correctly predicted that Clark would lose the New Hampshire primary and other primaries.

On September 18, 2004, Dole offered the inaugural lecture to dedicate the University of Arkansas [[Clinton School of Public Service]], during which he chronicled his life as a public servant and also discussed the importance of public service in terms of defense, civil rights, the economy, and in daily life.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.clintonschoolspeakers.com |title=Clinton School Speakers |publisher=Clinton School Speakers |accessdate=June 17, 2010}}</ref> Dole also gave the 2008 [[Robert C.

Dole has written several books, including one on jokes told by the Presidents of the United States, in which he ranks the presidents according to their level of humor. On April 12, 2005, Dole released his autobiography ''One Soldier's Story: A Memoir'', which talks of his World War II experiences and his battle to survive his war injuries.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Dole |first1=Robert J. |title=One Soldier's Story: A Memoir |date=2005 |publisher=HarperCollins Publishers |location=New York |isbn=0-06-076341-8 |edition=1st}}</ref>

[[Lee Atwater]], ''[[Boogie Man: The Lee Atwater Story]]''. In the film, Dole says, "I don't comment on Atwater," and, additionally, "This isn't politics, this is garbage."

On December 4, 2012, Dole made an appearance on the Senate floor to advocate ratification of the [[Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]]. Democratic Senator [[John Kerry]] explained: "Bob Dole is here because he wants to know that other countries will come to treat the disabled as we do." The Senate rejected the treaty by a vote of 61–38, less than the 66 required for ratification. Many Republican senators voted against the bill, fearing it would interfere with American sovereignty.<ref>{{cite news|last=Jennifer|first=Steinhauer|title=Dole Appears, but G.O.P.

Dole married Phyllis Holden, an occupational therapist at a veterans hospital, in [[Battle Creek, Michigan|Battle Creek]], Michigan, in 1948, three months after they met. Their daughter, Robin, was born on October 15, 1954. Dole and Holden divorced January 11, 1972.<ref>{{cite web|title=Washington Post profile, Dole's Ex-Wife Still Puzzled by Divorce|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/longterm/campaign/dole/exwife.htm|date=August 7, 1996}}</ref> Holden died on April 22, 2008.

Dole met his second wife, Elizabeth, in 1972. The couple were married on December 6, 1975. They have no children.

Dole is a [[Freemason]] and a member of Russell Lodge No. 177, Russell, Kansas. In 1975, Dole was elevated to the 33rd degree of the [[Scottish Rite]].<ref>{{cite book|title= Freemasonry in American History|year=1992|location=Lists of Lodges|isbn=978-0880530781|pages=408–410| author=Allen E.

===Health issues===
In 2001, Dole, at age 77, was treated successfully for an [[abdominal aortic aneurysm]] by [[Vascular surgery|vascular surgeon]] [[Kenneth Ouriel]]. Ouriel said Dole "maintained his sense of humor throughout his care."<ref name=twsSEPgh45>{{cite news

In recent years, Dole has struggled with health problems. In December 2004, he had a hip-replacement operation that required him to receive blood thinners. One month after the surgery, it was determined that Dole was [[Intracranial hemorrhage|bleeding inside his head]]. Dole spent 40 days at [[Walter Reed Army Medical Center]], and upon release, his stronger arm, the left, was of limited use. Dole told a reporter that he needed help to handle the simplest of tasks, since both of his arms are injured. He undergoes occupational therapy for his left shoulder once a week, but doctors have told him that he might not regain total use of his left arm.

In 2009, Dole was hospitalized for an elevated heart rate and sore legs for which he underwent a successful skin-graft procedure. In February 2010, Dole was hospitalized for pneumonia after undergoing knee surgery. He spent ten months at Walter Reed Army Medical Center, recovering from the surgery, and experienced three bouts with pneumonia. He was released from the hospital in November 2010. In January 2011, however, Dole was readmitted to Walter Reed Army Medical Center and spent about six days there, being treated for a fever as well as a minor infection.

Dole was hospitalized in the latter part of November 2012 at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, according to then-Senate Majority Leader [[Harry Reid]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Bob Dole Hospitalized|url=https://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2012/11/bob-dole-hospitalized/|publisher=ABC News|accessdate=November 28, 2012}}</ref>
