The '''Oyez Project''' at the [[Illinois Institute of Technology]]'s [[Chicago-Kent College of Law]] is an unofficial online multimedia archive of the [[Supreme Court of the United States]], especially audio of oral arguments. The website "aims to be a complete and authoritative source for all audio recorded in the Court since <nowiki>[...]</nowiki> October 1955." <ref name="About Oyez">[https://www.oyez.org/about/ About Oyez] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200929184407/https://www.oyez.org/about |date=2020-09-29 }} Oyez.org</ref> The website also includes [[biography|biographical information]] of both incumbent and historical [[justices]] of the Court and advocates who have argued before the court. The website was founded by Jerry Goldman, a research professor of law at the [[Chicago-Kent College of Law]] at [[Illinois Institute of Technology]].

==Government and private support==

According to the website, the Oyez Project received technological support from [[National Science Foundation]] and grants from [[National Endowment for the Humanities]]. The project is also supported by various academic institutions such as [[Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences]], the legal [[web portal]] [[FindLaw]], and the law firm [[Mayer Brown]], among others.<ref name="About Oyez"/>

Jerry Goldman put the Oyez Project up for sale in 2016.  He estimated it is "worth well over $1 million", but he hopes the buyer will not put the project behind a paywall.  Harvard Law School offered to pay the project's operating costs, but not Goldman's price.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Bravin|first1=Jess|title=Future of Oyez Supreme Court Archive Hangs in the Balance|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/law/2016/02/01/future-of-oyez-supreme-court-archive-hangs-in-the-balance/|accessdate=2 February 2016|work=The Wall Street Journal|date=1 February 2016|archive-date=1 February 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160201191532/http://blogs.wsj.com/law/2016/02/01/future-of-oyez-supreme-court-archive-hangs-in-the-balance/|url-status=live}}</ref> In July 2016, the [[Legal Information Institute]] at [[Cornell Law School]] and [[Justia]] joined IIT as sponsors.<ref>{{Cite web| title = Oyez website finds sponsors to take over its Supreme Court audio archives| work = ABA Journal| accessdate = 2017-09-08| url = http://www.abajournal.com/magazine/article/oyez_website_finds_sponsors_to_take_over_its_supreme_court_audio_archives/| archive-date = 2017-09-08| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170908064538/http://www.abajournal.com/magazine/article/oyez_website_finds_sponsors_to_take_over_its_supreme_court_audio_archives/| url-status = live}}</ref>
