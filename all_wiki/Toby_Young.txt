'''Toby Daniel Moorsom Young''' (born 17 October 1963) is a British social commentator and the London associate editor at ''[[Quillette]]'',<ref>{{cite web |url=https://quillette.com/2018/06/27/who-we-are/ |title=Who We Are |author=<!--Not stated--> |publisher=Quillette |date=27 June 2018 |access-date=30 September 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://quillette.com/about/ |title=About |author=<!--Not stated--> |publisher=Quillette |access-date=30 September 2018}}</ref> for whom he has written since 2017.<ref>{{cite web |title=Toby Young, Author at Quillette |url=https://quillette.com/author/toby-young/ |website=Quillette |accessdate=30 September 2018}}</ref> 

Young worked for ''[[The Times]]'' until being fired. He co-founded the London magazine ''[[Modern Review (London)|Modern Review]]'' in 1991, and edited it until financial difficulties led to its demise in 1995. His 2001 memoir ''[[How to Lose Friends & Alienate People (memoir)|How to Lose Friends & Alienate People]]'' details his subsequent employment at ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]''. He then went on to write for ''[[The Sun on Sunday]]'', the ''[[Daily Mail]]'', ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' and ''[[The Spectator]]''. He also served as a judge in seasons five and six of the television show ''[[Top Chef]]''.<ref>[http://www.tvguide.com/News/Top-Chef-Preview-58430.aspx "What's Cooking with Season 5 of ''Top Chef''?"] ''[[TV Guide]]''. 12 November 2008.

Young is a controversial figure; for example, writing, in 2015, an article in advocacy of genetically engineered intelligence, which he described as "progressive [[eugenic]]s".<ref name=":0">{{cite web|last=Young|first=Toby|url=https://quadrant.org.au/magazine/2015/09/fall-meritocracy/|title=The Fall of the Meritocracy|work=Quadrant|date=7 September 2015|accessdate=11 January 2018}}</ref>

A proponent of [[Free school (England)|free schools]], Young co-founded the [[West London Free School]] and served as Director of the [[New Schools Network]].

== Early life ==
Born in [[Buckinghamshire]], Young was brought up in [[Highgate]], [[North London]], and in [[South Devon]]. His mother Sasha (1931–1993), daughter of Raisley Stewart Moorsom, a descendant of Admiral Sir [[Robert Moorsom]], who fought at the [[Battle of Trafalgar]], through his son, Vice-Admiral [[Constantine Richard Moorsom]], chairman of the [[London and North-Western Railway]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.spectator.co.uk/2007/11/im-proud-that-my-ancestor-served-at-trafalgar-but-not-too-proud-to-sell-his-stuff/|title=I'm proud that my ancestor served at Trafalgar.

Young was educated at [[Creighton School]] (now [[Fortismere School]]), [[Muswell Hill]] and [[King Edward VI Community College]], [[Totnes]]. He left school at 16 having failed all but one of his [[GCE Ordinary Level|O Levels]], a C in English Literature,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/jan/05/why-impulsive-vain-toby-young-wants-us-to-take-him-seriously|title=Toby Young: social media self-obsessive still battling with father's shadow|last=Booth|first=Robert|date=5 January 2018|website=The Guardian|language=en|access-date=5 September 2018}}</ref> and worked under a Government [[Workfare in the United Kingdom|Youth Training Scheme]]{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}. He then retook his O Levels and went to the Sixth Form of [[William Ellis School]], [[Highgate]], leaving with two Bs and a C at A Level. Despite thus failing to achieve the College's BBB offer, he was given a place at [[Brasenose College, Oxford]]. Young claims he was sent an acceptance letter by mistake, as well as a letter of rejection from the admissions tutor [[Harry Judge]]: in an article he wrote for ''The Spectator'', he stated that his father phoned Judge to clarify the situation – Judge was in a meeting with the PPE tutors at the time, and after some discussion, they decided to offer Young a place.<ref name=status /> He had been given a conditional offer of three Bs plus an O Level pass in a foreign language under a scheme to give access to comprehensive pupils.<ref name=sundaytimes>{{cite news|last=Mikhailova|first=Anna|title=Fame and Fortune: How not to alienate the taxman|url=http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/business/money/investments/article1241130.ece|accessdate=8 August 2013|newspaper=[[The Sunday Times]]|date=7 April 2013|page=8}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Oxford admissions rouse passion as two tribes war over 'unfairness'|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/421666.article|accessdate=3 August 2013|newspaper=[[Times Higher Education]]}}</ref><ref name=status>{{cite news|last=Young|first=Toby|title=Status Anxiety|url=http://www.spectator.co.uk/life/status-anxiety/2092496/status-anxiety-49/|accessdate=3 August 2013|newspaper=[[The Spectator]]|date=11 September 2008}}</ref>

Young graduated in [[Philosophy, Politics and Economics]], and then worked for ''[[The Times]]'' for a six-month period as a news trainee until he was fired, for, according to Young himself, hacking the computer system: impersonating the editor [[Charles Wilson (journalist)|Charles Wilson]] and circulating senior executives' salaries to others around the building.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/universityeducation/11977647/I-went-to-a-state-school-and-got-a-First-at-Oxford.html|title=I went to a state school and got a First at Oxford|last=Young|first=Toby|date=5 November 2015|access-date=3 September 2018|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Young|first=Toby|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M-nwIgHbrZgC&pg=PT26|title=The Sound of No Hands Clapping|location=London|publisher=Little, Brown/Hachette Digital|year=2008|orig-year=2006|page=26|isbn=9780748109852}}</ref>  This was followed by a two-year period at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], where he carried out research for a doctorate that he did not complete.<ref name="Wilby">{{cite news|last=Wilby|first=Peter|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2011/apr/05/toby-young-london-free-school|title=Can Toby Young's free school succeed?|work=The Guardian|date=5 April 2011|accessdate=5 January 2018}}</ref>

==Journalism, writing and activism==
In 1991, Young co-founded and co-edited the ''[[Modern Review (London)|Modern Review]]'' with [[Julie Burchill]] and her then husband [[Cosmo Landesman]]. Its motto was "Low culture for highbrows".<ref name="Harris2005">{{cite news|last=Harris|first=John|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2005/may/29/pressandpublishing.observerreview|title=I supplied talent and drugs|work=The Observer|date=29 May 2005|accessdate=11 January 2018}}</ref> "The whole enterprise was driven by one fairly simple idea", Young told [[John Harris (critic)|John Harris]] writing for ''The Observer'' in 2005. "And that was that critics had a responsibility to take the best popular culture as seriously as the best high culture".<ref name="Harris2005"/>

Four years later the magazine was close to financial collapse and Young closed it down, angering his principal financial backer [[Peter York]], as well as Burchill and staff writer [[Charlotte Raven]].<ref name="Barber">{{cite news|last=Barber|first=Lynn|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/sep/03/biography|title=Forever Young|work=The Observer|date=3 September 2006|accessdate=11 January 2018}}</ref> Burchill had tried to replace Young as editor with Raven. "Ultimately the reason we fell out is because our relationship began as a kind of mentor-apprentice, and that was a kind of relationship which Julie was comfortable with. It was only when I succeeded in getting out from under her shadow that our relationship deteriorated", Young said in 2005.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Young|first1=Toby|last2=Morris|first2=Sophie|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/my-mentor-toby-young-on-julie-burchill-318526.html|title=My Mentor: Toby Young on Julie Burchill|work=The Independent|date=9 October 2005|accessdate=11 January 2018}}</ref>

Young moved to New York City shortly afterwards to work for ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' accepting an invitation from its editor, [[Graydon Carter]].{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} In the time he wrote for the magazine he contributed 3,000 words, but was paid $85,000.<ref>{{cite book|last=Young|first=Toby|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IeSbvMB9ChUC&pg=PT111|title=How To Lose Friends & Alienate People|location=London|publisher=Little, Brown/Hachette Digital|year=2008|orig-year=2001|page=111|isbn=9780748109845}}</ref> After being sacked by ''Vanity Fair'' in 1998, he stayed in New York for two more years, working as a columnist for the ''[[New York Press]]'', before returning to the UK in 2000. A memoir of these years, ''[[How to Lose Friends & Alienate People (memoir)|How to Lose Friends and Alienate People]]'', was published in 2001.<ref>{{cite news|last=Anthony|first=Andrew|url=https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2001/nov/11/society1|title=How to screw up.

Following [[Jack Davenport]], Young performed in the [[West End theatre|West End]] one-man stage adaptation of ''How to Lose Friends and Alienate People'' in 2004 in which, according to ''The Guardian''{{'}}s [[Lyn Gardner]], he managed to "make a spectacle of himself".<ref>{{cite web|last=Gardner|first=Lyn|url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2004/oct/30/theatre|title=How to Lose Friends and Alienate People (review)|work=The Guardian|date=30 October 2004|accessdate=11 January 2018}}</ref> In 2005, he co-wrote (with fellow ''Spectator'' journalist Lloyd Evans) a sex farce about the [[David Blunkett]]/[[Kimberley Fortier|Kimberley Quinn]] intrigue and the "Sextator" affairs of [[Boris Johnson]] and [[Rod Liddle]] called ''Who's the Daddy?''<ref>Sarah Lyall [http://www.iht.com/articles/2005/08/24/opinion/spectator.php "A very British 'documentary farce'"], ''International Herald Tribune'', 25 August 2005, reprinting a ''New York Times'' article.

During the [[2015 Labour Party (UK) leadership election|2015 Labour leadership election]], he encouraged readers of the politically conservative ''Daily Telegraph'' to join the Labour party and support [[Jeremy Corbyn]], who Young thought was the weakest candidate.<ref>{{cite news|title=Why Tories should join Labour and back Jeremy Corbyn|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/general-election-2015/politics-blog/11680016/Why-Tories-should-join-Labour-and-back-Jeremy-Corbyn.html|work=Telegraph.co.uk|language=en}}</ref>

In 2019, Young found the [[Cultural Marxism conspiracy theory]] to appeal to his intellectual proclivities.

==Controversies==

Senior Labour figures such as [[Dawn Butler]] and [[Angela Rayner]] criticised the appointment; however Young maintained he had support from senior Conservatives such as [[Boris Johnson]] (brother of [[Jo Johnson]], the universities minister who had appointed Young) and [[Michael Gove]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Rawlinson|first1=Kevin|title=Ditch Toby Young from watchdog board, top Labour figures tell May|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/jan/05/ditch-toby-young-from-watchdog-board-top-labour-figures-tell-may|work=The Guardian|accessdate=23 January 2018|date=5 January 2018}}</ref> [[Theresa May]] also defended the appointment on the BBC's ''[[The Andrew Marr Show|Andrew Marr Show]]'', but said she was previously unaware of the comments he had made on Twitter and "he would no longer be in public office" if he continued his previous use of language.<ref name="Kentish">{{cite news|last=Kentish|first=Ben|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/theresa-may-toby-young-sack-fire-refuse-misogynistic-homophobic-sexist-andrew-marr-bbc-latest-a8146236.html|title=Theresa May refuses to sack Toby Young over misogynistic and homophobic tweets|work=The Independent|date=7 January 2018|accessdate=9 January 2018}}</ref> On 8 January, universities minister Jo Johnson said in the House of Commons in answer to a question over the appointment: "We want to encourage Mr Young to develop the best sides of his personality".<ref>{{Cite news|last=Merrick|first=Rob|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/toby-young-resigns-universities-regulator-office-for-students-resignation-controversy-distraction-a8148921.html|title=Toby Young steps down from universities regulator after becoming 'distraction'|work=The Independent|date=9 January 2018|accessdate=9 January 2018}}</ref> Young resigned from the position the next day, writing in ''The Spectator'' that his appointment had "become a distraction" counteracting the "vital work" of the OfS.<ref name="Rawlinson">{{cite news|last1=Rawlinson|first1=Kevin|last2=Phipps|first2=Claire|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/jan/09/toby-young-resigns-office-for-students|title=Toby Young resigns from the Office for Students after backlash|work=The Guardian|date=9 January 2018|accessdate=9 January 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-42617922|title=Toby Young resigns from university regulator|work=BBC News|date=9 January 2018|accessdate=9 January 2018}}</ref> Shortly afterwards he resigned also as a [[Fulbright Commission]]er.<ref name="Fulb">{{cite web|title=Resignation from the Commission {{!}} US-UK Fulbright Commission|url=http://www.fulbright.org.uk/news/resignation-from-the-commission|publisher=[[Fulbright Commission]]|date=9 January 2018|accessdate=11 January 2018|language=en}}</ref>

An inquiry was launched shortly after Young's resignation by [[Peter Riddell]], the [[Commissioner for Public Appointments]]. Riddell said the OfS panel report to ministers about Young "made no mention of Mr Young’s history of controversial comments and use of social media".

===Eugenics===

In 2015, Young wrote an article for the Australian magazine ''[[Quadrant (magazine)|Quadrant]]'' entitled "The fall of meritocracy". In it he discussed developments in genetically engineered intelligence,  and  proposed that should the technology for selecting embryos for high intelligence become practicable, it could be provided "free of charge to parents on low incomes with below-average IQs.” He argued this "could help to address the problem of flat-lining inter-generational [[social mobility]] and serve as a counterweight to the tendency for the meritocratic elite to become a hereditary elite," through a mechanism that should be acceptable to political conservatives. “This is a kind of [[eugenics]] that should appeal to liberals — progressive eugenics.”<ref name=":0" />  Young has maintained that criticism of him as a eugenicist is “based on a deliberate misreading” of the article and that “If ‘eugenics’ is forced sterilisation, what I was proposing was the opposite — free [[IVF]] for the poor.”
<ref>{{cite journal|author= Toby Young| title= There’s nothing neutral about Wikipedia| journal= [[The Spectator]]|url = https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/there-s-nothing-neutral-about-wikipedia|date = 2020-10-30|quote = If it ever becomes possible for couples to cherry-pick embryos in a genetics lab according to which ones are likely to have the highest IQ, that technology should be made available for free on the NHS because otherwise it will enable the rich to give their children an even greater competitive advantage.

In January 2018, ''[[Private Eye]]''<ref>{{cite news|title=Toby Young breeds contempt|work=Private Eye|issue=1461|publisher=Pressdram Ltd|date=January 2018|page=11}}</ref> and the ''[[London Student]]''<ref>{{cite news|last1=Van Der Merwe|first1=Ben|title=Exposed: London's eugenics conference and its neo-Nazi links – London Student|url=http://londonstudent.coop/news/2018/01/10/exposed-london-eugenics-conferences-neo-nazi-links/|accessdate=30 January 2018|work=London Student|date=10 January 2018}}</ref> revealed that Young attended the [[London Conference on Intelligence]] at [[University College London]] (UCL) in 2017, which was described by the media and a number of politicians as a "secret eugenics conference".<ref>{{cite news|last1=Baynes|first1=Chris|title=University College London launches 'eugenics' probe after controversial secret conference on campus|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/education-news/university-college-london-eugenics-probe-secret-conference-campus-ucl-white-supremacists-debate-lci-a8153326.html|accessdate=21 January 2018|work=The Independent|date=11 January 2018}}</ref> The conference was convened by Honorary UCL professor James Thompson, and included speakers such as [[Richard Lynn]].<ref name="Rawlinson20180111">{{cite news|last1=Rawlinson|first1=Kevin|last2=Adams|first2=Richard|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/jan/10/ucl-to-investigate-secret-eugenics-conference-held-on-campus|title=UCL to investigate eugenics conference secretly held on campus|work=The Guardian|date=11 January 2018|accessdate=11 January 2018}}</ref>

Responding to these reports, Young wrote in ''[[The Spectator]]'' that he attended the conference as a journalist to report about it (which he later did) and that he "only [attended] for a few hours on a Saturday"<ref name="Adams110118"/> in preparation for the "super-respectable" [[International Society for Intelligence Research]] conference in [[Montreal]] in July 2017 at which he gave a speech, which was later published.<ref name="Rawlinson20180111"/><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.isironline.org/2017-montreal-canada-july-14-16/|work=International Society for Intelligence Research|title=2017: July 14-16 in Montreal|date=28 June 2017|accessdate=14 January 2018}}</ref><ref name=Breach>{{cite news|last=Young|first=Toby|url=https://blogs.spectator.co.uk/2018/01/toby-young-once-more-unto-the-breach/|title=Once more unto the breach|work=The Spectator|date=11 January 2018|accessdate=12 January 2018}}</ref> He also says that his resignation from the OfS and his presence at the conferences were unconnected.<ref name=Breach/>

===Hammond accusation===
In September 2019, Young accused a previous [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]], [[Philip Hammond]], on Twitter of promoting a "disgusting anti-Semitic conspiracy theory" by claiming, according to Young, that "Boris is being manipulated by a secret cabal of city financiers who stand to profit from economic ruin" after Hammond had said that the prime minister was "backed by speculators who have bet billions on a hard Brexit". Young apologised after Hammond responded that he was taking legal advice for defamation.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.indepndent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/boris-johnson-news-live-latest-brexit-today-no-deal-general-election-a9125916.html|title=Boris Johnson news - live: PM 'will be dismissed by Queen' if he refuses to seek Brexit delay after failing to get deal, as government hints at secret plan|last=Forrst|first=Adam|date=30 September 2019|accessdate=30 September 2019|work=The Independent}}</ref>

===COVID-19 lockdown===
In March 2020 during the [[COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom|COVID-19 pandemic]] in the UK, Young wrote in ''The Critic'' that he "suspect[ed] the Government has overreacted to the coronavirus crisis", expressing worry about the "economic cost".<ref name=tn-coronavirus-fury-toby-youngs-claims-elderly-people>{{Cite news|title=Coronavirus: Fury over Toby Young's claims about elderly people|url=https://www.thenational.scot/news/18347875.coronavirus-fury-toby-youngs-claims-elderly-people/|last=Webster|first=Laura|date=31 March 2020|access-date=20 May 2020|work=[[The National (Scotland)|The National]]}}</ref> In reference to the modelling of a team at Imperial College led by [[Neil Ferguson (epidemiologist)|Neil Ferguson]], he wrote: "spending £350 billion to prolong the lives of a few hundred thousand mostly elderly people is an irresponsible use of taxpayer's money."<ref name=tn-coronavirus-fury-toby-youngs-claims-elderly-people/> [[Peter Jukes]] tweeted, "in normal times the far right eugenicist views of people like Toby Young are just shameful and embarrassing. During a pandemic they can be outright deadly." [[Loki (rapper)|Darren McGarvey]] compared Young's views to [[austerity]].<ref name=tn-coronavirus-fury-toby-youngs-claims-elderly-people/>

Young, who initiated the ''Lockdown Sceptics'' newsletter<ref>{{cite web|url=https://lockdownsceptics.org/|title=Lockdown Sceptics|publisher=[[Toby Young]]|access-date=2019-08-21}}</ref> called for stopping the lockdown before 14 April 2020. Claiming that he had likely contracted the virus, he wrote that "if the Government does end the lockdown, and it turns out that by the time I require critical care the NHS cannot accommodate me, I won't regret writing this."<ref name=tn-coronavirus-fury-toby-youngs-claims-elderly-people/> He argued his own death would be "acceptable collateral damage" to prevent [[GDP]] dropping significantly.<ref name=tn-coronavirus-fury-toby-youngs-claims-elderly-people/>

Young's view contrasts with scientific recommendations for lockdown policy in the UK.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/science-and-technology/epidemiology-misinformation-coronavirus-covid19-conspiracy-theory|title=The epidemiology of misinformation|work=[[Prospect (magazine)|Prospect]]|last=Ball|first=Philip|date=19 May 2020|accessdate=20 May 2020}}</ref>

== Personal life ==
Prior to getting married, Young employed a Russian "daily" whom he later described as "a kind of surrogate mother". Young has since complained about the difficulty of finding reliable domestic staff.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.spectator.co.uk/2013/03/the-daily-i-miss-every-day/|title=The daily I miss every day|work=The Spectator|language=en-US|access-date=5 September 2018}}</ref>

In 1997, Young met Caroline Bondy while living in New York.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/sex/8489847/Toby-Young-British-women-are-the-best.html|title=Toby Young: British women are the best|date=8 May 2011|access-date=5 September 2018|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}</ref> After they split up, Young gave up drinking,  saying he "thought the only way I could persuade her to get back with me would be if I sobered up".

Young has admitted using illegal drugs – specifically taking [[cocaine]] at the [[Groucho Club]] in central London,<ref name="Milner">{{cite news|last1=Milner|first1=Catherine|last2=Hastings|first2=Chris|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1361435/White-powder-scare-at-the-Groucho.html|title=White powder scare at the Groucho|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|date=4 November 2001|accessdate=4 January 2018}}</ref> and also supplying drugs to others. He was subsequently expelled from membership of the Club in late 2001 for writing about the cocaine use of his friends whom he had supplied with the drug during a 1997 photo shoot for ''Vanity Fair''.<ref>{{cite news|last=Young|first=Toby|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2001/nov/18/books.comment|title=I've been kicked out of the club|newspaper=The Observer|date=18 November 2001|accessdate=4 January 2018}}</ref> Such activities are against Club rules.<ref name="Milner"/>

== On social media ==
Young has come under criticism for comments he made on [[Twitter]], most of which were deleted upon his appointment to the Board of the Office for Students. Young said that he posted more than 56,000 tweets, of which 8,439 remained as at January 2018.<ref name=tweets/>

These included what an ''[[Evening Standard]]'' editorial called "an obsession with commenting on the anatomy of women in the public eye".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/comment/comment/evening-standard-comment-there-s-method-behind-trump-s-twitter-war-a3730851.html|title=Evening Standard comment: There's method behind Trump's Twitter war|work=London Evening Standard|date=3 January 2018|accessdate=3 January 2018}}</ref> He referred on [[Twitter]] to the cleavage of unnamed female MPs sitting behind [[Ed Miliband]] in the Commons in 2011 and 2012.
