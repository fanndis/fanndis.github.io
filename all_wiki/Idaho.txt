'''Idaho''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=en-us-Idaho.ogg|ˈ|aɪ|d|ə|h|oʊ}}) is a [[U.S. state|state]] in the [[Pacific Northwest]] region of the [[United States]]. It borders the state of [[Montana]] to the east and northeast, [[Wyoming]] to the east, [[Nevada]] and [[Utah]] to the south, and [[Washington (state)|Washington]] and [[Oregon]] to the west. To the north, it shares a small portion of the [[Canada–United States border|Canadian border]] with the province of [[British Columbia]]. With a population of approximately 1.7&nbsp;million and an area of {{convert|83569|sqmi|km2}}, Idaho is the [[List of U.S. states and territories by area|14th largest]], the [[List of U.S. states and territories by population|12th least populous]] and the [[List of U.S. states by population density|7th least densely populated]] of the 50 U.S. states. The state's capital and largest city is [[Boise, Idaho|Boise]].

For thousands of years Idaho has been inhabited by [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American peoples]]. In the early 19th century, Idaho was considered part of the [[Oregon Country]], an area disputed between the [[United States]] and the [[British Empire]]. It officially became U.S. territory with the signing of the [[Oregon Treaty|Oregon Treaty of 1846]], but a separate [[Idaho Territory]] was not organized until 1863, instead being included for periods in [[Oregon Territory]] and [[Washington Territory]]. Idaho was eventually [[Admission to the Union|admitted to the Union]] on July 3, 1890, becoming the 43rd state.

Forming part of the [[Pacific Northwest]] (and the associated [[Cascadia (bioregion)|Cascadia bioregion]]), Idaho is divided into several distinct geographic and climatic regions. The state's north, the relatively isolated [[Idaho Panhandle]], is closely linked with [[Eastern Washington]] with which it shares the [[Pacific Time Zone]]—the rest of the state uses the [[Mountain Time Zone]]. The state's south includes the [[Snake River Plain]] (which has most of the population and agricultural land). The state's southeast incorporates part of the [[Great Basin]]. Idaho is quite mountainous, and contains several stretches of the [[Rocky Mountains]]. The [[United States Forest Service]] holds about 38% of Idaho's land, the highest proportion of any state.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110727120656/http://www.wildlandfire.com/docs/2007/western-states-data-public-land.htm "Western States Data Public Land Acreage"], ''wildlandfire.com''. Archived on July 27, 2011. Retrieved January 3, 2020.</ref>

Industries significant for the state economy include manufacturing, agriculture, mining, forestry, and tourism. A number of science and technology firms are either headquartered in Idaho or have factories there, and the state also contains the [[Idaho National Laboratory]], which is the country's largest [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]] facility. Idaho's agricultural sector supplies many products, but the state is best known for its [[potato]] crop, which comprises around one-third of the nationwide yield. The [[List of U.S. state nicknames|official state nickname]] is the "Gem State", which references Idaho's natural beauty.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://digitalatlas.cose.isu.edu/geog/explore/essay.pdf |title= Origins of the Name "Idaho" and How Idaho Became a Territory in 1863 |last= Wells |first= Merle W |access-date= January 16, 2019 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20190406151232/https://digitalatlas.cose.isu.edu/geog/explore/essay.pdf |archive-date= April 6, 2019 |url-status= live }}</ref>

The same year Congress created Colorado Territory, a county called [[Idaho County, Idaho|Idaho County]] was created in eastern [[Washington Territory]]. The county was named after a [[Steamboat|steamship]] named Idaho, which was launched on the [[Columbia River]] in 1860. It is unclear whether the steamship was named before or after Willing's claim was revealed. Regardless, part of Washington Territory, including Idaho County, was used to create Idaho Territory in 1863.<ref>{{Citation | publisher = ISU | url = http://imnh.isu.edu/digitalatlas/geog/explore/essay.pdf | contribution = Origins of the Name "Idaho" and How Idaho Became a Territory in 1863 | title = Idaho Museum of Natural History | access-date = March 6, 2013 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130120065016/http://imnh.isu.edu/digitalatlas/geog/explore/essay.pdf | archive-date = January 20, 2013 | url-status = live }}.</ref> Eventually, the name was given to the [[Idaho Territory]], which would later become the U.S. state.

Despite this lack of evidence for the origin of the name, many textbooks well into the 20th&nbsp;century repeated as fact Willing's account the name "Idaho" derived from the Shoshone term "ee-da-how". A 1956 Idaho history textbook says:
<blockquote>"Idaho" is a [[Shoshoni]] Indian exclamation. The word consists of three parts. The first is "Ee", which in English conveys the idea of "coming down". The second is "dah" which is the Shoshoni stem or root for both "sun" and "mountain". The third syllable, "how", denotes the exclamation and stands for the same thing in Shoshoni that the exclamation mark (!) does in English. The Shoshoni word is "Ee-dah-how", and the Indian thought thus conveyed when translated into English means, "Behold! the sun coming down the mountain.<ref>{{cite book | last1 =Barber | last2 = Martin |title= Idaho in the Pacific Northwest |publisher=Caxton Printers; Library of Congress | id = 55-5192 |year= 1956}}</ref></blockquote>

An alternative etymology attributes the name to the [[Plains Apache language|Plains Apache]] word "ídaahę́" {{IPA-all|í.taː.hɛ̃́}} (enemy) that was used in reference to the [[Comanche]].<ref>{{Citation | type = dictionary | url = http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Idaho | contribution = Idaho | title = Online Etymology Dictionary | access-date = January 30, 2010 | archive-url = https://www.webcitation.org/61Ac5ZguZ?url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Idaho | archive-date = August 24, 2011 | url-status = live }}.</ref>

==Geography==

[[File:National-atlas-idaho.PNG|right|thumb|Map of Idaho]]

Idaho borders six U.S. states and one Canadian province. The states of [[Washington (state)|Washington]] and [[Oregon]] are to the west, [[Nevada]] and [[Utah]] are to the south, and [[Montana]] and [[Wyoming]] are to the east. Idaho also shares a short border with the Canadian province of [[British Columbia]] to the north.

The landscape is rugged with some of the largest unspoiled natural areas in the United States. For example, at 2.3&nbsp;million acres (930,000&nbsp;ha), the [[Frank Church-River of No Return Wilderness Area]] is the largest contiguous area of protected wilderness in the continental United States. Idaho is a [[Rocky Mountains|Rocky Mountain]] state with abundant natural resources and scenic areas. The state has snow-capped mountain ranges, rapids, vast lakes and steep canyons. The waters of the [[Snake River]] run through [[Hells Canyon]], the deepest gorge in the United States. [[Shoshone Falls]] falls down cliffs from a height greater than [[Niagara Falls]].

By far, the most important river in Idaho is the [[Snake River]], a major tributary of the [[Columbia River]]. The Snake River flows out from [[Yellowstone]] in northwestern [[Wyoming]] through the [[Snake River Plain]] in southern Idaho before turning north, leaving the state at [[Lewiston, Idaho|Lewiston]] before joining the Columbia in [[Kennewick]]. Other major rivers are the [[Clark Fork (river)|Clark Fork]]/[[Pend Oreille River]], the [[Spokane River]], and major tributaries of the Snake river, including the [[Clearwater River (Idaho)|Clearwater River]], the [[Salmon River (Idaho)|Salmon River]], the [[Boise River]], and the [[Payette River]]. The Salmon River empties into the Snake in Hells Canyon and forms the southern boundary of Nez Perce County on its north shore, of which Lewiston is the county seat. The Port of [[Lewiston, Idaho|Lewiston]], at the confluence of the [[Clearwater River (Idaho)|Clearwater]] and the [[Snake River]]s is the farthest inland [[seaport]] on the West Coast at 465&nbsp;[[river mile]]s from the Pacific at [[Astoria, Oregon]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.u-s-history.com/pages/h2812.html |title=Port of Lewiston |publisher=US history |access-date=July 30, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110622052243/http://www.u-s-history.com/pages/h2812.html |archive-date=June 22, 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref>

The vast majority of Idaho's population lives in the [[Snake River Plain]], a valley running from across the entirety of southern Idaho from east to west. The valley contains the major cities of [[Boise]], [[Meridian, Idaho|Meridian]], [[Nampa, Idaho|Nampa]], [[Caldwell, Idaho|Caldwell]], [[Twin Falls, Idaho|Twin Falls]], [[Idaho Falls]], and [[Pocatello]]. The plain served as an easy pass through the [[Rocky Mountains]] for westward-bound settlers on the [[Oregon Trail]], and many settlers chose to settle the area rather than risking the treacherous route through the [[Blue Mountains (Pacific Northwest)|Blue Mountains]] and the [[Cascade Range]] to the west. The western region of the plain is known as the [[Treasure Valley]], bound between the [[Owyhee Mountains]] to the southwest and the [[Boise Mountains]] to the northeast. The central region of the Snake River Plain is known as the [[Magic Valley]].

Idaho's highest point is [[Borah Peak]], {{convert|12662|ft|0|abbr=on}}, in the [[Lost River Range]] north of [[Mackay, Idaho|Mackay]]. Idaho's lowest point, {{convert|710|ft|m|0|abbr=on}}, is in [[Lewiston, Idaho|Lewiston]], where the [[Clearwater River (Idaho)|Clearwater River]] joins the [[Snake River]] and continues into [[Washington (state)|Washington]]. The [[Sawtooth Range (Idaho)|Sawtooth Range]] is often considered Idaho's most famous mountain range.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.idahoaclimbingguide.com/id27.htm |title= Sawtooth Range |publisher= Idaho climbing guide |access-date= July 30, 2010 |url-status= dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110615075042/http://www.idahoaclimbingguide.com/id27.htm |archive-date= June 15, 2011 |df= mdy-all }}</ref> Other mountain ranges in Idaho include the [[Bitterroot Range]], the [[White Cloud Mountains]], the [[Lost River Range]], the [[Clearwater Mountains]], and the [[Salmon River Mountains]].

Idaho has two [[Time in the United States|time zones]], with the dividing line approximately midway between Canada and [[Nevada]]. Southern Idaho, including the [[Boise metropolitan area]], [[Idaho Falls, Idaho|Idaho Falls]], [[Pocatello, Idaho|Pocatello]], and [[Twin Falls, Idaho|Twin Falls]], are in the [[Mountain Time Zone]]. A legislative error ({{usctc|15|6}} §264) theoretically placed this region in the [[Central Time Zone]], but this was corrected with a 2007 amendment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uscode.house.gov/download/pls/15C6.txt |id=264 |title=Part of Idaho in fourth zone |publisher=House of representatives |place=Washington, D.C., U.S. |website=U.S. Code |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060125180343/http://uscode.house.gov/download/pls/15C6.txt |archive-date=January 25, 2006 }}</ref> Areas north of the [[Salmon River (Idaho)|Salmon River]], including [[Coeur d'Alene, Idaho|Coeur d'Alene]], [[Moscow, Idaho|Moscow]], [[Lewiston, Idaho|Lewiston]], and [[Sandpoint, Idaho|Sandpoint]], are in the [[Pacific Time Zone]], which contains less than a quarter of the state's population and land area.

===Climate===

[[File:Idaho Köppen.svg|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Köppen-Geiger climate classification|Köppen-Geiger]] climate types in Idaho]]

Idaho's [[climate]] varies widely. Although the state's western border is about {{convert |350|mi|-1}} from the Pacific Ocean, the maritime influence is still felt in Idaho, especially in the winter when cloud cover, [[humidity]], and [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] are at their maximum extent. This influence has a moderating effect in the winter where temperatures are not as low as would otherwise be expected for a northern state with predominantly high elevations.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.wrcc.dri.edu/narratives/IDAHO.htm | title = Climate of Idaho | website = WRCC | publisher = DRI | date = February 20, 1954 | access-date = July 30, 2010 | archive-url = https://www.webcitation.org/61AcEqgxB?url=http://www.wrcc.dri.edu/narratives/IDAHO.htm | archive-date = August 24, 2011 | url-status = live }}</ref> The maritime influence is least prominent in the state's eastern part where the precipitation patterns are often reversed, with wetter summers and drier winters, and seasonal temperature differences are more extreme, showing a more semi-arid [[continental climate]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://wrcc.dri.edu/narratives/IDAHO.htm|title=Climate of Idaho|website=Western Regional Climate Center|access-date=February 20, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171120183856/https://wrcc.dri.edu/narratives/IDAHO.htm|archive-date=November 20, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

Idaho can be hot, although extended periods over {{convert|98|°F|°C|abbr=on}} are rare, except for the lowest point in elevation, Lewiston, which correspondingly sees little snow. Hot summer days are tempered by the low relative humidity and cooler evenings during summer months since, for most of the state, the highest [[Day|diurnal]] difference in temperature is often in the summer.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://wrcc.dri.edu/narratives/IDAHO.htm |title= Climate of Idaho |website= WRCC—DRI |date= February 20, 1954 |access-date= January 23, 2017 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170221052600/http://www.wrcc.dri.edu/narratives/IDAHO.htm |archive-date= February 21, 2017 |url-status= live }}</ref> Winters can be cold, although extended periods of bitter cold weather below zero are unusual. Idaho's all-time highest temperature of {{convert|118|F|C}} was recorded at [[Orofino, Idaho|Orofino]] on July 28, 1934; the all-time lowest temperature of {{convert|-60|F|C}} was recorded at [[Island Park Dam]] on January 18, 1943.

==History==
{{main |History of Idaho}}

Humans may have been present in the Idaho area as long as 14,500 years ago. Excavations at [[Wilson Butte Cave]] near [[Twin Falls, Idaho|Twin Falls]] in 1959 revealed evidence of human activity, including arrowheads, that rank among the oldest dated artifacts in North America. [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indian]] peoples predominant in the area included the [[Nez Perce people|Nez Percé]] in the north and the Northern and Western [[Shoshone]] in the south.

A Late [[Upper Paleolithic]] site was identified at Cooper's Ferry in western Idaho near the town of [[Cottonwood, Idaho|Cottonwood]] by archaeologists in 2019. Based on evidence found at the site, first people lived in this area 15,300 to 16,600 years ago, predating the [[Beringia]] land bridge by about a thousand years. The discoverers, anthropology professor Loren Davis and colleagues, emphasized that they possess similarities with tools and artifacts discovered in [[Japan]] that date from 16,000 to 13,000 years ago.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/culture/2019/08/coopers-landing-idaho-site-americas-oldest/|title=15,000-year-old Idaho archaeology site now among America's oldest|date=August 29, 2019|website=Culture & History|access-date=September 5, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190905110333/https://www.nationalgeographic.com/culture/2019/08/coopers-landing-idaho-site-americas-oldest/|archive-date=September 5, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last1=G.

An early presence of French-Canadian trappers is visible in names and [[toponym]]s: Nez Percé, Cœur d'Alène, Boisé, Payette, some preexisting the [[Lewis and Clark]] and Astorian expeditions which themselves included significant numbers of French and Métis guides recruited for their familiarity with the terrain.

Idaho, as part of the [[Oregon Country]], was claimed by both the United States and Great Britain until the United States gained undisputed jurisdiction in 1846. From 1843 to 1849, present-day Idaho was under the de&nbsp;facto jurisdiction of the [[Provisional Government of Oregon]]. When Oregon became a state, what is now Idaho was in what remained of the original Oregon Territory not part of the new state, and designated as the Washington Territory.

Between then and the creation of the [[Idaho Territory]] on March 4, 1863, at Lewiston, parts of the present-day state were included in the [[Oregon Territory|Oregon]], [[Washington Territory|Washington]], and [[Dakota Territory|Dakota]] Territories. The new territory included present-day Idaho, [[Montana]], and most of [[Wyoming]]. The Lewis and Clark expedition crossed Idaho in 1805 on the way to the Pacific and in 1806 on the return, largely following the [[Clearwater River (Idaho)|Clearwater River]] both directions. The first non-indigenous settlement was [[Kullyspell House]], established on the shore of [[Lake Pend Oreille]] for fur trading in 1809 by [[David Thompson (explorer)|David Thompson]] of the [[North West Company]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.northamericanforts.com/West/id.html#thompson |title=David Thompson's Trading Post |website=Idaho Forts |publisher=American Forts Network |access-date=December 7, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090813155304/http://www.northamericanforts.com/West/id.html#thompson |archive-date=August 13, 2009 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Meinig |first=DW |author-link=D.W.

The [[United States Census Bureau]] estimates Idaho's population was 1,787,065 on July 1, 2018, a 14% increase since [[2010 United States Census|2010]].<ref name="PopEstUS">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/id,US/PST045218|title=QuickFacts Idaho; UNITED STATES|website=2018 Population Estimates|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]], Population Division|date=March 10, 2019|access-date=March 10, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190121064053/https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/id,US/PST045218|archive-date=January 21, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

Idaho had an estimated population of 1,754,208 in 2018, which was an increase of 37,265, from the prior year and an increase of 186,626, or 11.91%, since 2010. This includes a natural increase since the last census of 58,884 (111,131 births minus 52,247 deaths) and an increase due to net [[Human migration|migration]] of 75,795 people into the state. There are large numbers of Americans of English and German ancestry in Idaho. [[Immigration to the United States|Immigration]] from outside the United States resulted in a net increase of 14,522 people, and migration within the country produced a net increase of 61,273 people.

This made Idaho the tenth [[List of U.S. states by population growth rate|fastest-growing state]] after [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]] (+16.74%), [[Utah]] (+14.37%), [[Texas]] (+14.14%), [[Florida]] (+13.29%), [[Colorado]] (+13.25%), [[North Dakota]] (+13.01%), [[Nevada]] (+12.36%), [[Arizona]] (+12.20%) and [[Washington (state)|Washington]]. From 2017 to 2018, Idaho grew the second-fastest, surpassed only by Nevada.

[[Nampa, Idaho|Nampa]], about {{convert |20|mi|-1}} west of downtown Boise, became the state's second largest city in the late 1990s, passing [[Pocatello, Idaho|Pocatello]] and [[Idaho Falls, Idaho|Idaho Falls]]. Nampa's population was under 29,000 in 1990 and grew to over 81,000 by 2010. Located between Nampa and Boise, [[Meridian, Idaho|Meridian]] also experienced high growth, from fewer than 10,000 residents in 1990 to more than 75,000 in 2010 and is now Idaho's third largest city. Growth of 5% or more over the same period has also been observed in [[Caldwell, Idaho|Caldwell]], [[Coeur d'Alene, Idaho|Coeur d'Alene]], [[Post Falls, Idaho|Post Falls]], and [[Twin Falls, Idaho|Twin Falls]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/16000.html|title=Idaho|website=QuickFacts|place=US|publisher=Census Bureau|access-date=July 30, 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120611033538/http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/16000.html|archive-date=June 11, 2012}}</ref>

From 1990 to 2010, Idaho's population increased by over 560,000 (55%). The [[Boise metropolitan area]] (officially known as the Boise City-Nampa, ID Metropolitan Statistical Area) is Idaho's largest metropolitan area. Other metropolitan areas in order of size are [[Coeur d'Alene, Idaho|Coeur d'Alene]], [[Idaho Falls, Idaho|Idaho Falls]], [[Pocatello, Idaho|Pocatello]] and [[Lewiston, Idaho|Lewiston]].

Idaho is an important agricultural state, producing nearly one-third of the [[potato]]es grown in the United States. All three varieties of [[wheat]], dark northern spring, hard red, and soft white are grown in the state. [[Nez Perce County]] is considered a premier soft white growing locale.

Important industries in Idaho are food processing, lumber and wood products, machinery, chemical products, paper products, electronics manufacturing, silver and other mining, and tourism. The world's largest factory for barrel cheese, the raw product for [[processed cheese]] is in [[Gooding, Idaho]]. It has a capacity of 120,000&nbsp;metric tons per year of barrel cheese and belongs to the [[Glanbia]] group.<ref>{{Citation | title = Zuivelzicht | date = April 25, 2007}}.</ref> The [[Idaho National Laboratory]] (INL) is the largest Department of Energy facility in the country by area. INL is an important part of the eastern Idaho economy. Idaho also is home to three facilities of [[Anheuser-Busch]] which provide a large part of the malt for [[breweries]] across the nation.

A variety of industries are important. Outdoor recreation is a common example ranging from numerous [[snowmobile]] and downhill and [[cross-country ski]] areas in winter to the evolution of [[Lewiston, Idaho|Lewiston]] as a retirement community based on mild winters, dry, year-round climate and one of the lowest median wind velocities anywhere, combined with the rivers for a wide variety of activities. Other examples would be ATK&nbsp;Corporation, which operates three ammunition and ammunition components plants in Lewiston. Two are sporting and one is defense contract. The Lewis-Clark valley has an additional independent ammunition components manufacturer and the Chipmunk rifle factory until it was purchased in 2007 by Keystone Sporting Arms and production was moved to [[Milton, Pennsylvania]]. Four of the world's six welded aluminum jet boat (for running river rapids) manufacturers are in the Lewiston-Clarkston, WA valley. [[Wine]] grapes were grown between [[Kendrick, Idaho|Kendrick]] and Juliaetta in the [[Idaho Panhandle]] by the French [[Rothschilds]] until [[Prohibition]]. In keeping with this, while there are no large wineries or breweries in Idaho, there are numerous and growing numbers of award-winning boutique wineries and microbreweries in the northern part of the state.

Today, Idaho's largest industry is the science and technology sector. It accounts for over 25% of the state's revenue and over 70% of the state's exports. Idaho's industrial economy is growing, with high-tech products leading the way. Since the late 1970s, [[Boise]] has emerged as a center for [[semiconductor manufacturing]]. Boise is the home of [[Micron Technology]], the only U.S. manufacturer of [[dynamic random-access memory]] (DRAM) chips. Micron at one time manufactured desktop computers, but with very limited success. [[Hewlett-Packard]] has operated a large plant in Boise since the 1970s, which is devoted primarily to [[HP LaserJet|LaserJet printers]] production.<ref>{{cite web | place = Washington, D.C., US | url = http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/today/mar04.html | title = Today in History: March 4 | website = Memory | publisher = Library of Congress | access-date = July 30, 2010 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100727164920/http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/today/mar04.html | archive-date = July 27, 2010 | url-status = live }}</ref> Boise-based [[Clearwater Analytics]] is another rapidly growing investment accounting and reporting software firm, reporting on over $1&nbsp;trillion in assets.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://clearwater-analytics.com/about | title=About Clearwater | date=2014 | access-date=June 20, 2014 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140519114501/http://clearwater-analytics.com/about | archive-date=May 19, 2014 | url-status=dead }}</ref> [[ON Semiconductor]], whose worldwide headquarters is in [[Pocatello, Idaho|Pocatello]], is a widely recognized innovator of modern integrated mixed-signal semiconductor products, mixed-signal foundry services, and structured digital products.

[[Sun Microsystems]] (now a part of [[Oracle Corporation]]) has two offices in Boise and a parts depot in Pocatello. Sun brings $4&nbsp;million in annual salaries and over $300&nbsp;million of revenue to the state each year.

A number of [[Fortune 500]] companies started in or trace their roots to Idaho, including [[Safeway Inc.|Safeway]] in [[American Falls, Idaho|American Falls]], [[Albertsons (SuperValu)|Albertsons]] in Boise, [[JR Simplot]] across southern Idaho, and [[Potlatch Corp.]] in Lewiston. Zimmerly Air Transport in Lewiston-Clarkston was one of the five companies in the merger centered around [[Varney Air Lines]] of [[Pasco, Washington]], which became [[United Airlines]] and subsequently Varney Air Group which became [[Continental Airlines]].

In 2014, Idaho emerged as the second most small business friendly state, ranking behind Utah, based on a study drawing upon data from more than 12,000 small business owners.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fundivo.com/tips/best-and-worst-states-for-business-owners/|title=Best and Worst States for Business Owners|website=Fundivo|access-date=August 27, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140903111314/http://www.fundivo.com/tips/best-and-worst-states-for-business-owners/|archive-date=September 3, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Taxation===
Tax is collected by the [[Idaho State Tax Commission]].<ref>https://tax.idaho.gov/</ref>

The state personal [[income tax]] ranges from 1.6% to 7.8% in eight income brackets. Idahoans may apply for state [[tax credit]]s for taxes paid to other states, as well as for donations to Idaho state educational entities and some nonprofit youth and rehabilitation facilities.

The state [[sales tax]] is 6% with a very limited, selective local option up to 6.5%. Sales tax applies to the sale, rental or lease of tangible personal property and some services. Food is taxed, but [[prescription drug]]s are not. Hotel, [[motel]], and [[campground]] accommodations are taxed at a higher rate (7% to 11%). Some jurisdictions impose local option sales tax.

The [[sales tax]] was introduced at 3% in 1965, easily approved by voters,<ref name=csrv>{{cite news |url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=kw0zAAAAIBAJ&pg=6680%2C2966915 |newspaper = Spokesman-Review |agency = Associated Press |title = Conservatism given credit by Samuelson |date = November 10, 1966 |page = 1 |access-date = November 20, 2015 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151121000834/https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=kw0zAAAAIBAJ&sjid=rugDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6680%2C2966915 |archive-date = November 21, 2015 |url-status = live }}</ref> where it remained at 3% until 1983.<ref name=stxhis>{{cite web|url=http://tax.idaho.gov/i-1023.cfm#sub3|publisher=State of Idaho|title=Sales tax rate history|access-date=June 11, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130521023534/http://tax.idaho.gov/i-1023.cfm#sub3|archive-date=May 21, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Energy==
[[File:Average Fuel Mix in Idaho.png|thumb|Average Fuel Mix (2011–2015)]]

As of 2017, the primary energy source in Idaho was hydropower, and the energy companies had a total retail sales of 23,793,790 megawatthours (MWh).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.eia.gov/electricity/state/Idaho/|title=EIA—State Electricity Profiles|website=www.eia.gov|access-date=July 19, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190719011439/https://www.eia.gov/electricity/state/Idaho/|archive-date=July 19, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> As of 2017, Idaho had a regulated electricity market, with the [[Idaho Public Utilities Commission]] regulating the three major utilities of [[Avista|Avista Utilities]], [[Idaho Power]], and [[PacifiCorp|Rocky Mountain Power]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ballotpedia.org/Energy_policy_in_Idaho|title=Energy policy in Idaho|website=Ballotpedia|language=en|access-date=July 19, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181108120418/https://ballotpedia.org/Energy_policy_in_Idaho|archive-date=November 8, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

Idaho's energy landscape is favorable to the development of [[renewable energy]] systems. The state is rich in renewable energy resources but has limited fossil fuel resources. The [[Snake River Plain]] and smaller river basins provide Idaho with some of the nation's best [[hydroelectric power]] resources and its geologically active mountain areas have significant [[geothermal power]] and [[wind power]] potential. These realities have shaped much of the state's energy landscape.

Idaho imports most of the energy it consumes. Imports account for more than 80% of energy consumption, including all of Idaho's natural gas and petroleum supplies and more than half of its electricity. Of the electricity consumed in Idaho in 2005, 48% came from hydroelectricity, 42% was generated by burning coal and 9% was generated by burning natural gas. The remainder came from other renewable sources such as wind.<ref name="2007 Idaho Energy Plan">{{cite web | title = 2007 Idaho Energy Plan | publisher = Idaho Legislative Council Interim Committee on Energy, Environment and Technology | year = 2007 | url = http://www.energy.idaho.gov/informationresources/d/energy_plan_2007.pdf | access-date = November 30, 2010 | archive-url = https://www.webcitation.org/61AhPRqmV?url=http://www.energy.idaho.gov/informationresources/d/energy_plan_2007.pdf | archive-date = August 24, 2011 | url-status = live }}</ref>

The state's numerous river basins allow hydroelectric power plants to provide 556,000&nbsp;MWh, which amounts to about three-fourths of Idaho's electricity generated in the state. Washington State provides most of the natural gas used in Idaho through one of the two major pipeline systems supplying the state. Although the state relies on out-of-state sources for its entire natural gas supply, it uses natural gas-fired plants to generate 127,000&nbsp;MWh, or about ten percent of its output. Coal-fired generation and the state's small array of wind turbines supplies the remainder of the state's electricity output.

While Idaho's {{convert|515|e12BTU|TWh|lk=on}} total energy consumption is low compared with other states and represents just 0.5% of United States consumption, the state also has the nation's 11th smallest population, 1.5&nbsp;million, so its per capita energy consumption of {{convert|352|e6BTU|MWh|abbr=unit}} is just above the national average of {{convert|333|e6BTU|MWh|abbr=unit}}.<ref name="Idaho Energy Profile" /> As the 13th‑largest state in terms of land area of {{convert|83,570|mi2|acre km2}}, distance creates the additional problem of "line loss". When the length of an electrical transmission line is doubled, the resistance to an electric current passing through it is also doubled.

In addition, Idaho also has the 6th fastest growing population in the United States with the population expected to increase by 31% from 2008 to 2030.<ref>{{cite web|title=Idaho Strategic Energy Alliance Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=Idaho Strategic Energy Alliance |year=2009 |url=http://www.energy.idaho.gov/idahostrategicenergyalliance/d/isea_faq.pdf |access-date=June 2, 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090416044506/http://energy.idaho.gov/idahostrategicenergyalliance/d/isea_faq.pdf |archive-date=April 16, 2009 }}</ref> This projected increase in population will contribute to a 42% increase in demand by 2030, further straining Idaho's finite hydroelectric resources.<ref>{{cite web | title = FAQ | publisher = Idaho Energy Complex | year = 2009 | url = http://idahoenergycomplex.org/faq.htm | access-date = June 2, 2007 }}{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

==Transportation==
The [[Idaho Transportation Department]] is the [[government agency]] responsible for Idaho's transportation infrastructure, including [[Maintenance, repair and operations|operations and maintenance]] as well as planning for future needs. The agency is also responsible for overseeing the disbursement of [[Administration of federal assistance in the United States|federal]], state, and [[Grant (money)|grant]] [[funding]] for the transportation programs of the state.<ref name="faq">{{Cite journal | title = FAQ | publisher = ITD | year = 2007 | url = http://itd.idaho.gov/NewsAndInfo/faqs.htm | access-date = April 22, 2007 | quote = The transportation department also oversees federal grants to 15 rural and urban public transportation systems, provides state rail planning and rail-project development and supports bicycle and pedestrian projects. | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070426120934/http://itd.idaho.gov/NewsAndInfo/faqs.htm | archive-date = April 26, 2007 | url-status = dead }}</ref>

===Highways===
{{Main|List of state highways in Idaho}}

Idaho is among the few states in the nation without a major freeway linking its two largest metropolitan areas, [[Boise, Idaho|Boise]] in the south and [[Coeur d'Alene, Idaho|Coeur d'Alene]] in the north. [[U.S. Route 95 in Idaho|US-95]] links the two ends of the state, but like many other highways in Idaho, it is badly in need of repair and upgrade. In 2007, the [[Idaho Transportation Department]] stated the state's highway infrastructure faces a $200&nbsp;million per year shortfall in maintenance and upgrades. [[Interstate 84 in Idaho|I-84]] is the main highway linking the southeast and southwest portions of the state, along with [[Interstate 86 (Idaho)|I-86]] and [[Interstate 15 in Idaho|I-15]].

===Airports===

Major airports include the [[Boise Airport|Boise International Airport]] which serves the southwest region of Idaho and the [[Spokane International Airport]] (in [[Spokane, Washington]]) which serves northern Idaho. Other airports with scheduled service are the [[Pullman-Moscow Regional Airport]] serving the [[Palouse]]; the [[Lewiston-Nez Perce County Airport]], serving the Lewis-Clark Valley and north central and west central Idaho; The [[Magic Valley Regional Airport]] in Twin Falls; the [[Idaho Falls Regional Airport]]; and the [[Pocatello Regional Airport]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://traveltips.usatoday.com/major-airports-idaho-25709.html|title=Major Airports in Idaho|website=Traveltips.usatoday.com|access-date=September 4, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170904043747/http://traveltips.usatoday.com/major-airports-idaho-25709.html|archive-date=September 4, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Railroads===

Idaho is served by three transcontinental railroads. The [[Burlington Northern Santa Fe]] (BNSF) connects the [[Idaho Panhandle]] with [[Seattle]], [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], and [[Spokane, Washington|Spokane]] to the west, and [[Minneapolis]] and Chicago to the east. The [[BNSF]] travels through [[Kootenai County, Idaho|Kootenai]], [[Bonner County, Idaho|Bonner]], and [[Boundary County, Idaho|Boundary]] counties. The [[Union Pacific Railroad]] crosses North Idaho entering from Canada through [[Boundary County, Idaho|Boundary]] and [[Bonner County, Idaho|Bonner]], and proceeding to [[Spokane, Washington|Spokane]]. [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] uses [[Union Pacific Railroad]] tracks in North Idaho carrying products from [[Alberta, Canada|Alberta]] to [[Spokane, Washington|Spokane]] and [[Portland, Oregon]]. [[Amtrak]]'s Empire Builder crosses northern Idaho, with its only stop being in [[Sandpoint, Idaho|Sandpoint]]. [[Montana Rail Link]] also operates between [[Billings, Montana]] and [[Sandpoint, Idaho]]

The [[Union Pacific Railroad]] also crosses southern Idaho traveling between Portland, Oregon, Green River, [[Wyoming]], and [[Ogden, Utah]] and serves [[Boise, Idaho|Boise]], [[Nampa, Idaho|Nampa]], [[Twin Falls, Idaho|Twin Falls]], and [[Pocatello, Idaho|Pocatello]].

===Ports===

The Port of [[Lewiston, Idaho|Lewiston]] is the farthest inland Pacific port on the west coast. A series of dams and locks on the [[Snake River]] and [[Columbia River]] facilitate barge travel from Lewiston to [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], where goods are loaded on ocean-going vessels.

==Law and government==

[[File:Boise Idaho.jpg|thumb|The [[Idaho State Capitol]] in [[Boise, Idaho|Boise]]]]

===State constitution===

The constitution of Idaho is roughly modeled on the national constitution with several additions. The constitution defines the form and functions of the state government, and may be amended through [[plebiscite]]. Notably, the state constitution presently requires the state government to maintain a balanced budget. As result, Idaho has limited debt (construction bonds, etc.).<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web|url=https://history.idaho.gov/sites/default/files/uploads/ID%20Constitution%2010_30_2014.pdf|title=Constitution of the State of Idaho|website=History.idaho.gov|access-date=September 4, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170525200628/https://history.idaho.gov/sites/default/files/uploads/ID%20Constitution%2010_30_2014.pdf|archive-date=May 25, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Idaho Code and Statutes===

All of Idaho's state laws are contained in the Idaho Code and Statutes. The code is amended through the legislature with the approval of the governor. Idaho still operates under its original (1889) state constitution.<ref name=autogenerated1 />

===State government===

The constitution of Idaho provides for three branches of government: the executive, legislative and judicial branches. Idaho has a [[bicameral]] legislature, elected from 35 legislative districts, each represented by one senator and two representatives.

Since 1946, statewide elected constitutional officers have been elected to four-year terms. They include: [[List of Governors of Idaho|Governor]], [[Lieutenant Governor of Idaho|Lieutenant Governor]], [[Secretary of State of Idaho|Secretary of State]], [[Idaho state controller]] (Auditor before 1994), Treasurer, [[Idaho Attorney General|Attorney General]], and Superintendent of Public Instruction.

Last contested in 1966, Inspector of Mines was an originally elected constitutional office. Afterward it was an appointed position and ultimately done away with entirely in 1974.

Idaho's government has an [[Alcoholic beverage control state|alcohol monopoly]].

====Executive branch====

{{Further |List of Governors of Idaho}}
{{Further |Lieutenant Governor of Idaho}}
{{Further |Secretary of State of Idaho}}

The governor of Idaho serves a four-year term, and is elected during what is nationally referred to as midterm elections. As such, the governor is not elected in the same election year as the president of the United States. The current governor is [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Brad Little]], who was elected in 2018.

====Legislative branch====

{{Main |Idaho Legislature}}
[[File:House of Representatives Chamber, Idaho State Capitol.jpg|thumb|right|Chamber of the House of Representatives in 2018]]

Idaho's [[State legislature (United States)|legislature]] is part-time. However, the session may be extended if necessary, and often is. Because of this, Idaho's legislators are considered "citizen legislators", meaning their position as a legislator is not their main occupation.

Terms for both the [[Idaho Senate|Senate]] and [[Idaho House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] are two years. Legislative elections occur every even numbered year.

The Idaho Legislature has been continuously controlled by the Republican Party since the late&nbsp;1950s, although Democratic legislators are routinely elected from [[Boise, Idaho|Boise]], [[Pocatello, Idaho|Pocatello]], [[Blaine County, Idaho|Blaine County]] and the northern Panhandle.

====Judicial branch====

{{Main |Courts of Idaho}}

The highest court in Idaho is the [[Idaho Supreme Court]]. There is also an intermediate [[appellate court]], the [[Idaho Court of Appeals]], which hears cases assigned to it from the Supreme Court. The state's District Courts serve seven judicial districts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.isc.idaho.gov/district.htm |title=Idaho District Court Websites |publisher=ISC |place=ID |access-date=December 17, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216011413/http://www.isc.idaho.gov/district.htm |archive-date=December 16, 2008 }}</ref>

====Counties====

{{Main |List of counties in Idaho}}

Idaho is divided into political jurisdictions designated as ''[[County (United States)|counties]]''. Since 1919 there are 44 counties in the state, ranging in size from {{convert|410|to|8,502|sqmi}}.

[[File:Idaho map counties.svg|frameless|upright=1.35|right|Map of Idaho's counties]]

Three counties were first designated as such by the Washington Territorial Legislature in 1861;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.idahohistory.net/pierce.html|title=Pierce|publisher=Idaho History|date=July 7, 2010|access-date=July 30, 2010|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/675MM7Eax?url=http://www.idahohistory.net/pierce.html|archive-date=April 21, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> they were subsequently redesignated as Idaho counties in 1864. The 1861 Nez Percé county has since been broken up into Nez Percé, Lewis, Boundary, Benewah, Latah, Kootenai, and Clearwater counties.

Idaho license plates begin with a county designation based on the first letter of the county's name. Where a letter is at the beginning of more than one name, a number accompanies precedingly in alphabetical order. This reflects an anomalous coincidental situation wherein 10 counties begin with B, seven with C and four with L, which is 21 of the 44 counties.

After the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], many Midwestern and Southern [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] moved to the Idaho Territory. As a result, the early territorial legislatures were solidly Democrat-controlled. In contrast, most of the territorial governors were appointed by [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] presidents and were Republicans. This led to sometimes-bitter clashes between the two parties, including a range war with the Democrats backing the sheepherders and the Republicans the cattlemen, which ended in the [[Jack Davis (prospector)|"Diamondfield" Jack Davis]] murder trial. In the 1880s, Republicans became more prominent in local politics.

In 1864, Clinton DeWitt Smith removed the territorial seal and the state constitution from a locked safe, and took them to Boise. This effectively moved the capital from where they were stored ([[Lewiston, Idaho]]) to the current capital Boise.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://idahoptv.org/capitoloflight/article-05.cfm|title=Capitol Move or Theft?—Essays—Capitol of Light (Idaho Public Television)|website=Idahotv.org|access-date=September 4, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170525200618/http://idahoptv.org/capitoloflight/article-05.cfm|archive-date=May 25, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Since statehood, the Republican Party has usually been the dominant party in Idaho. At one time, Idaho had two Democratic parties, one being the mainstream and the other called the Anti-Mormon Democrats, lasting into the early 20th century. In the 1890s and early 1900s, the [[Populist Party (United States)|Populist Party]] enjoyed prominence while the Democratic Party maintained a brief dominance in the 1930s during the [[Great Depression]]. Since World War{{nbsp}}II most statewide-elected officials have been Republicans, though the Democrats did hold the majority in the House (by one seat) in 1958 and the governorship from 1971 to 1995.

Idaho Congressional delegations have also been generally Republican since statehood. Several Idaho Democrats have had electoral success in the [[United States House of Representatives|House]] over the years, but the [[United States Senate|Senate]] delegation has been a Republican stronghold for decades. Several Idaho Republicans, including current Senator [[Mike Crapo]], have won reelection to the Senate, but only [[Frank Church]] has won reelection as a Democrat. Church was the last Idaho Democrat to win a U.S.&nbsp;Senate race, in 1974. [[Walt Minnick]]'s 2008 win in the [[Idaho's 1st congressional district|First Congressional District]] was the state's first Democratic Congressional victory in 16&nbsp;years.

In modern times, Idaho has been a reliably Republican state in presidential politics. It has not supported a Democrat for [[president of the United States|president]] since [[1964 United States presidential election|1964]]. Even in that election, [[Lyndon Johnson]] defeated [[Barry Goldwater]] in the state by fewer than two percentage points, compared to a landslide nationally. In [[2004 United States presidential election|2004]], Republican [[George W. Bush]] carried Idaho by a margin of 38 percentage points and with 68.4% of the vote, winning in 43 of 44 counties. Only [[Blaine County, Idaho|Blaine County]], which contains the [[Sun Valley, Idaho|Sun Valley]] ski resort, supported [[John Kerry]], who owns a home in the area. In [[2008 United States presidential election|2008]] [[Barack Obama]]'s 36.1&nbsp;percent<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.idsos.state.id.us/elect/RESULTS/2008/general/tot_stwd.htm | place = ID | publisher = Secretary of State Election Division | date = November 4, 2008 | title = General Election Results | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20081215210242/http://www.idsos.state.id.us/ELECT/RESULTS/2008/general/tot_stwd.htm | archive-date = December 15, 2008 | df = mdy-all }}.</ref> showing was the best for a Democratic presidential candidate in Idaho since [[1976 United States presidential election|1976]]. However, Republican margins were narrower in [[1992 United States presidential election|1992]] and [[1976 United States presidential election|1976]].

In the 2006 elections, Republicans, led by gubernatorial candidate [[C. L. Otter|CL&nbsp;"Butch" Otter]], won all the state's constitutional offices and retained both of the state's seats in the [[United States House of Representatives]]. However, Democrats picked up several seats in the Idaho Legislature, notably in the Boise area.<ref>{{Citation|url=http://www.ncsl.org/ncsldb/elect98/profile.cfm?yearsel=2006&statesel=ID |publisher=NCSL |title=Elections 1 998 |type=profile |year=2006 |contribution=ID |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090501023622/http://www.ncsl.org/ncsldb/elect98/profile.cfm?yearsel=2006&statesel=ID |archive-date=May 1, 2009 }}</ref>

Republicans lost one of the House seats in 2008 to Minnick, but Republican [[Jim Risch]] retained [[Larry Craig]]'s Senate seat for the GOP by a comfortable margin.<ref>{{Citation|url=http://www.sos.idaho.gov/ELECT/results/ENR/statewide_total.html |year=2008 |contribution=Statewide totals |title=Election |type=results |place=ID |publisher=State government |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150220191630/http://www.sos.idaho.gov/ELECT/results/ENR/statewide_total.html |archive-date=February 20, 2015 }}</ref> Minnick lost his seat in the 2010 election to Republican State Rep. [[Raul Labrador]].

In 2020, Idaho overwhelmingly voted for President Donald Trump. Despite the view that Idaho's bigger cities are "blue islands in a sea of red", as several articles have put it; that was not the case in 2020. Only 3 Idaho counties went blue, and those were Latah, Blaine, and Teton counties, respectively. Every Republican candidate running won their respective race and Idaho residents voted over whelmingly to retain Republican judges. Additionally, ballot measures leaned towards the right. Medical/recreational marijuana and a crime bill to give victims more rights were absent from the ballot. Former Vice President, Joe Biden, received roughly 33.6 percent of the votes, which was slightly lower than what was received by former President, Barack Obama.

The Idaho State Board of Education oversees three comprehensive universities. The [[University of Idaho]] in [[Moscow, Idaho|Moscow]] was the first university in the state (founded in 1889). It opened its doors in 1892 and is the [[Land-grant university|land-grant institution]] and primary research university of the state. [[Idaho State University]] in [[Pocatello, Idaho|Pocatello]] opened in 1901 as the Academy of Idaho, attained four-year status in 1947 and university status in 1963. [[Boise State University]] is the most recent school to attain university status in Idaho. The school opened in 1932 as Boise Junior College and became Boise State University in 1974. [[Lewis-Clark State College]] in [[Lewiston, Idaho|Lewiston]] is the only public, non-university four-year college in Idaho. It opened as a [[normal school]] in 1893.

Idaho has four regional community colleges: [[North Idaho College]] in [[Coeur d'Alene, Idaho|Coeur d'Alene]]; [[College of Southern Idaho]] in [[Twin Falls, Idaho|Twin Falls]]; [[College of Western Idaho]] in [[Nampa, Idaho|Nampa]], which opened in 2009, [[College of Eastern Idaho]] in [[Idaho Falls, Idaho|Idaho Falls]], which transitioned from a [[technical college]] in 2017.

Private institutions in Idaho are [[Boise Bible College]], affiliated with congregations of the [[Christian churches and churches of Christ]]; [[Brigham Young University-Idaho]] in [[Rexburg, Idaho|Rexburg]], which is affiliated with The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and a [[sister college]] to [[Brigham Young University]]; The [[College of Idaho]] in [[Caldwell, Idaho|Caldwell]], which still maintains a loose affiliation with the Presbyterian Church; [[Northwest Nazarene University]] in [[Nampa, Idaho|Nampa]]; and [[New Saint Andrews College]] in [[Moscow, Idaho|Moscow]], of reformed Christian theological background.
