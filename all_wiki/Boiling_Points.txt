'''''Boiling Points''''' is a prank [[reality television]] show, much like the format used on ''[[Candid Camera]]''. It was broadcast on [[MTV]] in the United States from 2004 to 2005. In each half-hour episode, annoying situations were set up and deliberately inflicted on one or more young adults who were unaware that they were being tested. Examples included poor or incompetent [[customer service]] in a store or [[restaurant]], being accosted by a date's ex-love-interest while out together, and unprovoked rudeness from a total stranger.

While being watched via [[hidden camera]], the subject of the show must refrain from displaying a temper or storming off for a predetermined length of time. If he or she passes, a prize of $100 cash is awarded to them on the spot.

Typically, the Boiling Point time on each segment is anywhere from 3 to 20 minutes. Most often, people lose because they use obscenities in their confusion and/or anger.

The cast included improvisers [[Alison Becker]], Jonathan Blitt, [[Colton Dunn]], Giselle Forte, [[Rebekka Johnson]], Billy Merritt, [[Missy O'Reilly]], Eric Wippo and Sauce.

== Unusual occurrences ==
*In a skit involving Blitt serving [[pizza]] slices intentionally flipped upside-down on to a plate, one mark responded to being told to pay again if she wanted a new slice by throwing both the drink and the pizza on to Blitt.
*Johnson was playing a cashier at a supermarket who was irritating a customer by talking with a cellphone ear piece while scanning items for her. The customer lunged over the counter and attempted to snatch the ear piece.

== Celebrity prankees ==
* Now better known as [[Lady Gaga]], a then unknown 19-year-old named Stefani Germanotta appeared as a contestant in 2005.<ref name="ref1">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/videos/news/443032/lady-gaga-reaches-her-boiling-point-in-2005.jhtml#id=1627599|title=Lady Gaga reaches her Boiling Point|accessdate=2009-10-05|work=MTV|publisher=mtv.com}}</ref>
