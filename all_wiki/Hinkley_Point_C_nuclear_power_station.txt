In February 2016, EDF again delayed a final decision on proceeding with the project, disclosing that the financial agreement with CGN was yet to be confirmed. EDF, which had recently reported a 68% fall in net profit, was still looking at how it would finance its share of the project. With EDF's share price having halved over the preceding year, the cost of the Hinkley Point C project now exceeded the entire [[Market capitalization|market capitalisation]] of EDF.

In November 2012, it was announced that the [[Office for Nuclear Regulation|UK Office for Nuclear Regulation]] (ONR) had awarded a nuclear site licence to [[NNB Generation Company]], a subsidiary created by [[EDF Energy]].<ref name="bbc261112">{{cite news|title=Hinkley Point nuclear station: Licence granted for site |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-somerset-20499033 |work=BBC News |accessdate=27 November 2012 |date=26 November 2012 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121127171507/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-somerset-20499033 |archive-date=27 November 2012 }}</ref> This was the first nuclear site licence awarded for a nuclear power station in the UK since 1987, when one was granted for the construction of [[Sizewell B]] in Suffolk.<ref name="bbc261112" />

Through 2013, the operator was in negotiations with the [[Department of Energy and Climate Change]] and other government agencies. A major sticking point was a demand by EDF Energy for a guaranteed price for the electricity to be produced, which was about twice the current UK electricity rates. The project is part of the UK's plans to implement a 50% cut in greenhouse gas emissions by the mid-2020s, which provides for building Hinkley Point C and several other nuclear power plants. By 2013, the operator had invested about £1 billion in site preparation and other start-up costs. If built, the plant will meet about 7% of the UK's electricity needs.<ref name="NYT031513">{{cite news|title=Britain's Plans for New Nuclear Plant Approach a Decisive Point, 4 Years Late |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/16/business/energy-environment/britains-nuclear-plans-at-a-critical-point.html |accessdate=16 March 2013 |newspaper=The New York Times |date=15 March 2013 |author=Stanley Reed |author2=Stephen Castle |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130319005553/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/16/business/energy-environment/britains-nuclear-plans-at-a-critical-point.html |archive-date=19 March 2013 }}</ref>

The UK's Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR) on 28 March 2017 granted its first consent to begin construction of the Hinkley Point C nuclear power plant. The consent covers the placement of the structural concrete for the first nuclear safety-related structure.<ref>Nuclear Engineering International news letter, retrieved 3 April 2017</ref>

On 15 March 2019, the [[Environment Agency]] invited comments on an environmental permit application from NNB Generation Company (HPC) Limited  for Hinkley Point C Power Station, with a closing date of 26 July 2019.<ref>https://consult.environment-agency.gov.uk/psc/ta5-1ud-nnb-generation-company-hpc-limited-2/</ref>

==Economics==
===Cost to consumers===
EDF has negotiated a guaranteed fixed price&nbsp;– a [[Renewable energy in the United Kingdom#Strike prices|"strike price"]]– for electricity from Hinkley Point C of £92.50/MWh (in 2012 prices),<ref name=bbcstrike /><ref name=telestrike /> which will be adjusted (linked to inflation) during the construction period and over the subsequent 35 years tariff period. The [[Renewable energy in the United Kingdom#Strike prices|strike price]] could fall to £89.50/MWh if a new plant [[Sizewell nuclear power stations|at Sizewell]] is also approved.<ref name="bbcstrike" /><ref name="telestrike" /> High consumer prices for energy will hit the poorest consumers hardest according to the [[Public Accounts Committee]].<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-42065837 Hinkley Point will 'hit the poorest hardest', say MPs] ''[[BBC]]''</ref>

In July 2016, the [[National Audit Office (United Kingdom)|National Audit Office]] estimated that due to falling energy costs, the additional cost to consumers of 'future top-up payments under the proposed HPC CfD had increased from £6.1 billion in October 2013, when the [[Renewable energy in the United Kingdom#Strike prices|strike price]] was agreed, to £29.7 billion'.<ref name="NAO">{{cite web|author=Department of Environment and Climate Change |url=https://www.nao.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Nuclear-power-in-the-UK.pdf |title=Nuclear Power in the UK |publisher=National Audit Office |date=13 July 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160717075657/https://www.nao.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Nuclear-power-in-the-UK.pdf |archive-date=17 July 2016 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2016/07/13/hinkley-point-subsidy-bill-quadruples-as-power-price-forecasts-f/ |title=Hinkley Point subsidy bill quadruples as power price forecasts fall |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |first=Emily |last=Gosden |date=13 July 2016 |accessdate=5 August 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160817170212/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2016/07/13/hinkley-point-subsidy-bill-quadruples-as-power-price-forecasts-f/ |archive-date=17 August 2016 }}</ref> In July 2017, this estimate rose to £50 billion, or 'more than eight times the 2013 estimate'.<ref name = "NAO2"/>

A 2014 [[Agora Energiewende]] study found that new wind and solar generation is up to 50% cheaper than new nuclear, based on what they described as a conservative comparison of current feed-in tariffs in Germany with the agreed [[Renewable energy in the United Kingdom#Strike prices|strike price]] for Hinkley Point C. The study does not actually compare UK strike prices for wind and solar energy sources with the proposed UK strike price for nuclear energy, and it ignores a number of external and integration costs, including all costs of grid upgrades expected for wind, solar, and gas sources, and for wind and solar specifically, both the expected future reductions in cost for these sources and most of the increased integration costs for variable energy resources.<ref>{{cite book |author=Agora Energiewende |title=Comparing the cost of low-carbon technologies : what is the cheapest option? : an analysis of new wind, solar, nuclear and CCS based on current support schemes in the UK and Germany |year=2014 |publisher=[[Agora Energiewende]] |place=Berlin, Germany |url=http://www.agora-energiewende.de/fileadmin/Projekte/2014/low-carbon-technologies/Agora_Analysis_Decarbonisationtechnologies_web_final.pdf |access-date=29 April 2016 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160602073630/https://www.agora-energiewende.de/fileadmin/Projekte/2014/low-carbon-technologies/Agora_Analysis_Decarbonisationtechnologies_web_final.pdf |archive-date=2 June 2016  }}</ref>

In 2016 Third Generation Environmentalism ([[E3G]]) proposed five ways that the UK could be powered at lower cost to the consumers than by Hinkley Point C:
* improved energy efficiency could reduce consumption by more than the projected capacity of HPC, according to a [[McKinsey & Company|McKinsey]] report for the government,
* onshore wind power, which is much cheaper and offshore wind power which is likely to also become cheaper than power from HPC,
* solar power which by 2016 has become cheaper than power from HPC,
* [[interconnector]]s to Norway, Denmark and France, according to a report for [[National Infrastructure Commission|NIC]] and
* savings in electricity due to improved storage and [[smart grid|flexibility]], according to a NIC report for the government.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2016/mar/18/five-ways-to-power-the-uk-that-are-far-better-than-hinkley-point |title=Five ways to power the UK that are far better than Hinkley Point |work=The Guardian |first=Damian |last=Carrington |date=18 March 2016 |access-date=20 August 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160826012751/https://www.theguardian.com/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2016/mar/18/five-ways-to-power-the-uk-that-are-far-better-than-hinkley-point |archive-date=26 August 2016 }}</ref>

In August 2016, CEO Henrik Poulsen of [[DONG Energy]] argued that the UK's future energy needs can be covered with accelerated construction of cheaper [[offshore wind farms]] instead of Hinkley Point C. Poulsen state that wind farms could currently undercut HPC's strike price with £85/MWh, while others in the industry believe that by the mid-2020s the electricity price from offshore wind farms would reach £80/MWh.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/04/windfarms-hinckley-point-plant-henrik-paulsen-dong |title=Hinkley Point C is not only new energy option, says windfarm developer |first=Terry |last=Macalister |work=The Guardian |date=4 August 2016 |access-date=6 August 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160806000504/https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/04/windfarms-hinckley-point-plant-henrik-paulsen-dong |archive-date= 6 August 2016 }}</ref> On 10 August 2016, [[Ambrose Evans-Pritchard]] of the ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' wrote that, with growth in energy storage there is little point in construction of [[baseload power plant]]s such as HPC and alleged that "nuclear reactors cannot be switched on and off as need demands"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2016/08/10/holy-grail-of-energy-policy-in-sight-as-battery-technology-smash/ |title=Holy Grail of energy policy in sight as battery technology smashes the old order |first=Ambrose |last=Evans-Pritchard |newspaper=The Telegraph |date=10 August 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160811133703/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2016/08/10/holy-grail-of-energy-policy-in-sight-as-battery-technology-smash/ |archive-date=11 August 2016 }}</ref> (see also [[Load following power plant#Nuclear power plants]]).

On 26 August 2016, the [[Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit]] released a report on alternatives to Hinkley Point C. It found that a mixture of established approaches including wind farms, cables connecting the UK grid with other countries and gas-fired power stations, together with measures to manage demand, would save the UK around £1 billion per year while keeping the lights on and meeting climate targets.<ref>{{cite web|author=Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit |url=http://eciu.net/assets/ECIU_Hinkley_What-if.compressed.pdf |title=Hinkley: What If?

On 12 October 2017, ''[[The Guardian]]'' reported that researchers informed MPs that the UK government was using the expensive Hinkley Point C project to cross-subsidise the UK military's nuclear-related activity by maintaining nuclear skills. The researchers from the [[University of Sussex]], [[Andy Stirling|Prof. Andy Stirling]] and Dr. Phil Johnstone, stated that the costs of the [[Trident nuclear programme|Trident nuclear submarine programme]] would be prohibitive without "an effective subsidy from electricity consumers to military nuclear infrastructure".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/oct/12/electricity-consumers-to-fund-nuclear-weapons-through-hinkley-point-c|title=Electricity consumers 'to fund nuclear weapons through Hinkley Point C'|last=Watt|first=Holly|date=12 October 2017|work=The Guardian|access-date=13 October 2017|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>

===Return on equity===
One analyst at Liberium Capital described the strike price as 'economically insane' in October 2013: "as far as we can see this makes Hinkley Point the most expensive power station in the world... on a leveraged basis we expect EDF to earn a Return on Equity (ROE) well in excess of 20% and possibly as high as 35%".<ref>The Guardian 30 October 2013: [https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/oct/30/hinkley-point-nuclear-power-plant-uk-government-edf-underwrite Hinkley Point: nuclear power plant gamble worries economic analysts ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160826222134/https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/oct/30/hinkley-point-nuclear-power-plant-uk-government-edf-underwrite |date=26 August 2016 }}</ref> "Having considered the known terms of the deal, we are flabbergasted that the UK Government has committed future generations of consumers to the costs that will flow from this deal".<ref name="ITV">{{cite web |author=Laura Kuenssberg |url=http://www.itv.com/news/2013-10-30/ouch-energy-analyst-is-staggered-by-uks-nuclear-deal/ |title=Ouch&nbsp;— energy analyst is 'staggered' by UK's nuclear deal' |publisher=ITV |date=30 October 2013 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131031075546/http://www.itv.com/news/2013-10-30/ouch-energy-analyst-is-staggered-by-uks-nuclear-deal/ |archive-date=31 October 2013 }}</ref>

According to a March 2014 report by [[Policy Connect]], ROE could be between around 19 and 21%, with "broadly two possible reasons...firstly, the risks faced by EDF could genuinely be greater, therefore commanding a higher rate of return. Alternatively, or in addition, the negotiating process may not have been effective in driving down the expected [[rate of return]] relative to risk. A lack of competition in the negotiating process could have been influential here. The European Commission has questioned the likelihood of the first of these explanations, in light of what is already known about the allocation of risk".

Two EPR reactors are currently operating at the [[Taishan Nuclear Power Plant]] in China. 
Two other EPR units are currently under construction at [[Olkiluoto Nuclear Power Plant]] in Finland and at the [[Flamanville Nuclear Power Plant]] in France. The HPC design has significant changes from the previous units, with 20% more equipment than the Taishan design. The safeguards buildings have been redesigned. The HPC technical director stated in 2019 "In effect HPC is a first-of-a-kind plant in a country that has not built a new plant for three decades."<ref name=wnn-20191107>{{cite news |url=http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/Articles/Costs-and-financing-key-to-Europes-nuclear-future |title=Costs and financing key to Europe's nuclear future |publisher=World Nuclear News |date=7 November 2019 |accessdate=8 November 2019}}</ref>

In December 2007, the [[Union of Concerned Scientists]] referred to the [[EPR (nuclear reactor)|EPR]] as the only new reactor design under consideration that "...appears to have the potential to be significantly safer and more secure against attack than today's reactors".<ref name="NPIAWW">{{cite web|title=Nuclear Power in a Warming World |work=Union of Concerned Scientists |url=http://www.ucsusa.org/assets/documents/nuclear_power/nuclear-power-in-a-warming-world.pdf |date=December 2007 |accessdate=1 October 2008 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081023095126/http://www.ucsusa.org/assets/documents/nuclear_power/nuclear-power-in-a-warming-world.pdf |archive-date=23 October 2008 }}</ref>

The group is reportedly concerned that the new generation of power stations will store nuclear waste on site until a permanent repository is found&nbsp;– claiming this is an unknown length of time and, could potentially take decades.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/somerset/hi/people_and_places/newsid_8352000/8352537.stm |title=In depth: Hinkley Point C proposals |date=17 March 2010 |publisher=BBC |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131007032031/http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/somerset/hi/people_and_places/newsid_8352000/8352537.stm |archive-date= 7 October 2013 }}</ref> The group issued a press release opposing any plans for a new power station on 24 September 2008, when it was announced that EDF had offered to acquire British Energy, the protest group has acknowledged that opposition in the local area is by no means unanimous.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stophinkley.org/PressReleases/pr080924.htm |date=24 September 2008 |title=Response to BE takeover by EDF |publisher=Stop Hinkley |accessdate=25 September 2008 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720052934/http://www.stophinkley.org/PressReleases/pr080924.htm |archive-date=20 July 2011 }}</ref>

In October 2011, more than 200 protesters blockaded the site. Members of several [[anti-nuclear]] groups that are part of the Stop New Nuclear alliance barred access to Hinkley Point power station in protest at EDF Energy's plans to renew the site with two new reactors.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/oct/03/hinkley-point-protest-nuclear-power |title=Hinkley Point power station blockaded by anti-nuclear protesters |date=3 October 2011 |work=The Guardian |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160611145052/http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/oct/03/hinkley-point-protest-nuclear-power |archive-date=11 June 2016 }}</ref>

In February 2012, about seven protesters set up camp in an abandoned farmhouse on the site of the proposed Hinkley Point C nuclear power station. They were reportedly angry that "West Somerset Council has given EDF Energy the go-ahead for preparatory work before planning permission has been granted". The group also claimed that a nature reserve is at risk from the proposals.<ref name=hink2012>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-somerset-17002517 |title=Anti-nuclear campaigners set up camp at Hinkley C site |date=12 February 2012 |work=BBC News |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120218225812/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-somerset-17002517 |archive-date=18 February 2012 }}</ref>

On 10 March 2012, the first anniversary of the [[Fukushima nuclear disaster]], two hundred anti-nuclear campaigners formed a symbolic chain around Hinkley Point to voice their opposition to new nuclear power plants, and to call on the coalition government to hold back on its plan for seven other new nuclear plants across the UK. The human chain was planned to continue for 24 hours, with the activists blocking the main Hinkley Point entrance.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.presstv.ir/detail/231009.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120313031437/http://www.presstv.ir/detail/231009.html|archive-date=13 March 2012|title=Brits protest against govt. nuclear plans |date=10 March 2012 |publisher=Press TV}}</ref>

In Germany, the renewable energy supplier Elektrizitätswerke Schönau (EWS) lodged a formal complaint on 28 November 2014 (therefore after the October 2014 European Commission approval), on the basis that the project 'breaches Article 107 TFEU by approving distortive state aids'.<ref name=EWSletter>{{cite web |url=https://www.ews-schoenau.de/fileadmin/content/documents/Mitwissen/Atomkraft/EWS_Complaint_Hinkley_Point.pdf |title=Rechtsanwältin Dr. Cornelia Ziehm |date=28 November 2014 |work=Elektrizitätswerke Schönau|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150618163133/https://www.ews-schoenau.de/fileadmin/content/documents/Mitwissen/Atomkraft/EWS_Complaint_Hinkley_Point.pdf|archive-date=18 June 2015}}</ref> EWS also launched an online petition, with about 168,000 supporters by June 2015.<ref name=EWSpetition>{{cite web |url=https://www.ews-schoenau.de/campaign.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150627162857/https://www.ews-schoenau.de/campaign.html|archive-date=27 June 2015|title=No Money for Nuclear Power - Stop Brussels! |work=Elektrizitätswerke Schönau}}</ref>

In 2015, [[Theresa May]]'s [[Special advisers (UK government)|political adviser]] [[Nick Timothy]] wrote an article to oppose [[People's Republic of China]]'s involvement in sensitive sectors such as the Hinkley Point C nuclear power project. He criticised [[David Cameron]] and [[George Osborne]] of "selling our [[national security]] to China" without rational concerns and "the Government seems intent on ignoring the evidence and presumably the advice of the security and intelligence agencies." He warned that security experts are worried the Chinese could use their role in the programme (designing and constructing [[nuclear reactor]]) to build weaknesses into [[computer systems]] which allow them to shut down Britain's energy production at will and "...no amount of trade and investment should justify allowing a hostile state easy access to the country's critical national infrastructure."<ref name="Timothy-1">[https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/29/hinkley-point-c-why-has-government-delayed-final-approval Why have ministers delayed final approval for Hinkley Point C?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160730205353/https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/29/hinkley-point-c-why-has-government-delayed-final-approval |date=30 July 2016 }}, ''[[The Guardian]]'', 29 July 2016</ref><ref name="Timothy-0">[http://www.conservativehome.com/thecolumnists/2015/10/nick-timothy-the-government-is-selling-our-national-security-to-china.html Nick Timothy: The Government is selling our national security to China] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160731135519/http://www.conservativehome.com/thecolumnists/2015/10/nick-timothy-the-government-is-selling-our-national-security-to-china.html |date=31 July 2016 }}, [[Conservative Home]], 20 October 2015</ref><ref name="Timothy-2">[https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/30/theresa-may-delayed-hinkley-point-chinese-beijing-vince-cable Theresa May 'raised objections to project as home secretary'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160731203845/https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/30/theresa-may-delayed-hinkley-point-chinese-beijing-vince-cable |date=31 July 2016 }}, ''[[The Guardian]]'', 30 July 2016</ref>

On 23 June 2017 the [[National Audit Office (United Kingdom)|National Audit Office]] published a report on Hinkley Point C.  The conclusions were summarised as follows: "The Department has committed electricity consumers and taxpayers to a high cost and risky deal in a changing energy marketplace. Time will tell whether the deal represents value for money, but we cannot say the Department has maximised the chances that it will be." [[Amyas Morse]], head of the National Audit Office, 23 June 2017.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nao.org.uk/report/hinkley-point-c/|title=Hinkley Point C - National Audit Office (NAO) Report|website=National Audit Office}}</ref>

Hinkley Point C was an issue in campaigning for the [[2017 French presidential election]], the first round of which was held in April 2017. [[Marine Le Pen]]'s National Front was "fundamentally against" the project while [[Emmanuel Macron]] was in support of it.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2017/04/10/marine-le-pen-could-pull-plug-hinkley-point-project-elected/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170411190457/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2017/04/10/marine-le-pen-could-pull-plug-hinkley-point-project-elected/|url-status=dead|title=Marine Le Pen could pull the plug on Hinkley Point project if elected|first=Jillian|last=Ambrose|date=10 April 2017|archive-date=11 April 2017|via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}</ref>
