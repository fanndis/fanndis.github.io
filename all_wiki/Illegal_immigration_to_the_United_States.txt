'''Illegal immigration to the United States''' is the process of migrating into the United States in violation of [[List of United States immigration laws|federal immigration laws]].  This can include [[foreign national#In the United States|foreign national]]s who have entered the United States illegally, as well as those who entered legally but then remained after the expiration of their [[visa policy of the United States|entry visa]] or [[advance parole|parole documents]].<ref name="admission">{{uscsub|8|1101|a|13|A}} ("The terms 'admission' and 'admitted' mean, with respect to an [[alien (law)#United States|alien]], the '''lawful entry''' of the alien into the United States after inspection and authorization by an [[immigration officer]].") (emphasis added).</ref> [[Illegal immigration]] has been a matter of intense debate in the United States since the 1980s.

Research shows that illegal immigrants increase the [[Economy of the United States|size of the U.S. economy]], contribute to [[economic growth]], enhance the welfare of natives, contribute more in tax revenue than they collect, reduce American firms' incentives to [[offshoring|offshore]] jobs and import foreign-produced goods, and benefit consumers by reducing the prices of goods and services.<ref name="CBO 2007"/><ref name="Mayda 2017"/><ref name="Liu 2010"/><ref name="Palivos 2010"/> Economists estimate that legalization of the illegal immigrant population would increase the immigrants' earnings and consumption considerably, and increase U.S. gross domestic product.<ref name="Rivera-Batiz 1999"/><ref name="Hall 2010"/><ref name="Bratsberg 2002"/><ref name="Dustmann 2017"/> There is scholarly consensus that illegal immigrants commit less crime than natives.<ref name="Gonzalez 2017"/> [[Sanctuary cities]]—which adopt policies designed to avoid prosecuting people solely for being in the country illegally—have no statistically meaningful impact on crime, and may reduce the crime rate.<ref name="Collingwood 2016">{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2016/10/03/sanctuary-cities-do-not-experience-an-increase-in-crime/|title=Sanctuary cities do not experience an increase in crime|last1=Collingwood|first1=Loren|last2=Gonzalez-O'Brien|first2= Benjamin|last3=El-Khatib|first3= Stephen|date=October 3, 2016|website=Washington Post|access-date=October 3, 2016}}</ref><ref name="Martinez 2017"/> Research suggests that immigration enforcement has no impact on crime rates.<ref name="Miles 2015"/><ref name="Baker 2015"/><ref name="Collingwood 2016"/>

The latter two constitute illegal immigrants: as they have no legal documentation to entitle them to be in the U.S., they are also referred to as undocumented immigrants.

Non-citizen residence can be or become illegal in one of four ways: by unauthorized entry, by failure of the employer to pay worker documentation fees, by staying beyond the expiration date of a visa or other authorization, or by violating the terms of legal entry.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.justice.gov/oig/reports/INS/e9608/i9608p1.htm|title=Inspections Report|publisher=Inspections Division, Office of the Inspector General, Department of Justice}}</ref>{{failed verification|date=April 2013}}<ref name="modes"/>{{failed verification|date=April 2013}}

{{further|History of immigration to the United States}}
{{See also|List of United States immigration laws}}
Fewer than seven years after ex-slaves had been granted citizenship in the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]], more rigorous immigration controls were enacted with the [[Page Act of 1875]], banning Chinese women, and the [[Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882]], expanded to all Chinese immigrants.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XhuhDQAAQBAJ&pg=PA9&lpg=PA9|title=Expelling the Poor: Atlantic Seaboard States and the Nineteenth-century Origins of American Immigration Policy|last=Hirota|first=Hidetaka|date=2017|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780190619213|language=en}}</ref> As early as 1904, mounted border watchmen were employed by the [[Immigration and Naturalization Service|U.S. Immigration Service]] to prevent illegal southern border crossings.<ref name="cbp.gov">{{Cite web|url=https://www.cbp.gov/border-security/along-us-borders/history|title=Border Patrol History {{!}} U.S. Customs and Border Protection|website=www.cbp.gov|access-date=2020-01-02}}</ref> Texas Rangers were also often employed in border protection.

During the late 19th century, various [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] rulings were made regarding the Constitutional rights of illegal immigrants. In [[Yick Wo v. Hopkins|''Yick Wo v. Hopkins'' (1886)]], the court ruled that under the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]], all people, regardless of "race, of color, or of nationality" have the right to due process and equal protection under the law.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/118/356.html |title = FindLaw's United States Supreme Court case and opinions}}</ref> A similar ruling of [[Wong Wing v.

A 1904 court decision defined any alien as lacking Constitutional rights when not within the United States.{{efn|"... if an alien is not permitted to enter this country, or, having entered contrary to law, is expelled, he is in fact cut off from worshipping or speaking or publishing or petitioning in the country; but that is merely because of his exclusion therefrom. He does not become one of the people to whom these things are secured by our Constitution by an attempt to enter, forbidden by law. To appeal to the Constitution is to concede that this is a land governed by that supreme law, and as under it the power to exclude has been determined to exist, those who are excluded cannot assert the rights in general obtaining in a land to which they do not belong as citizens or otherwise."

The [[Union of American Hebrew Congregations]] noted that under the standing interpretation that Turks, Syrians, Palestinians and Jews were not white, "even Jesus of Nazareth himself" would be excluded from citizenship. As a result, judges and immigration officials often admitted and naturalized technically-ineligible people as a form of protest against the laws.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/culture/2018/10/birthright-citizenship-explainer-united-states-history/|title=How the Founding Fathers understood U.S. citizenship|date=2018-10-31|website=Culture|language=en|access-date=2019-12-26}}</ref><ref name=ArchivesPrologue>{{Cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov/publications/prologue/2002/summer/immigration-law-1.html|title=Race, Nationality, and Reality|date=2016-08-15|website=National Archives|language=en|access-date=2019-12-26}}</ref>

By 1940, administrative and legislative action had loosened racial restrictions on naturalization of immigrants, including a ruling that Mexicans were considered white for immigration and naturalization purposes, and a law permitting the naturalization of "descendants of races indigenous to the Western Hemisphere."<ref name="ArchivesPrologue" /> The quotas were eased in the [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952]], and a year after the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] outlawed discrimination based on race or national origin,<ref name="washpost" /> [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965|the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965]] abolished the quota system.

In 1996, Congress debated two immigration bills - one focused on limiting legal immigration, and another other focused on illegal immigration.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.visalaw.com/iirira-96-a-summary-of-the-new-immigration-bill/|title=IIRIRA 96 - A SUMMARY OF THE NEW IMMIGRATION BILL|date=1996-11-30|website=Siskind Susser PC|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-02}}</ref> The legal immigration reform bills failed to pass, while the illegal immigration bill was passed in the form of the [[Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996]]. President [[Bill Clinton]] signed the Act into law and it became effective on April 1, 1997. The key components of the Act included increasing the number of border agents, increasing penalties on those who assisted illegal immigrants into the United States, creating a 10-year re-entry ban on those who had been deported after living in the U.S. illegally for over one year, and expanding the list of crimes that any immigrant (regardless of legal status) could be deported for.

==Profile and demographics==
{{Main|Illegal immigrant population of the United States}}{{Update|section|date=August 2017}}
In 2012, an estimated 14 million people live in families in which the head of household or the spouse is in the United States without authorization.<ref name="autogenerated9" /> Illegal immigrants arriving recently before 2012 tend to be better educated than those who have been in the country a decade or more. A quarter of all immigrants who have arrived in recently before 2012 have at least some college education. Nonetheless, illegal immigrants as a group tend to be less educated than other sections of the U.S. population: 49 percent haven't completed high school, compared with 9 percent of native-born Americans and 25 percent of legal immigrants.<ref name="autogenerated9" />
Illegal immigrants work in many sectors of the U.S. economy. Illegal immigrants have lower incomes than both legal immigrants and native-born Americans, but earnings do increase somewhat the longer an individual is in the country.<ref name="autogenerated9" />

===Population===
From 2005 to 2009, the number of people entering the U.S. illegally every year declined from a yearly average of 850,000 in the early 2000s to 300,000 in 2009, according to the Pew Hispanic Center.<ref name="number drops 2010"/> The most recent estimates put the number of unauthorized immigrants at 11 million in 2015, representing 3.4% of the total U.S. population.<ref name="Pew 2017"/> The population of unauthorized immigrants peaked in 2007, when it was estimated at 12.2 million and 4% of the total U.S. population.<ref name="Pew 2017"/><ref name="Economic and Fiscal 2016"/> As of 2014, unauthorized immigrant adults had lived in the U.S. for a median of 13.6 years, with approximately two-thirds having lived in the U.S. for at least a decade.<ref name="Pew 2017"/> Pew Research estimated in 2017 that there were over seven million illegal immigrants in the U.S. workforce.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/06/12/5-facts-about-illegal-immigration-in-the-u-s/|title=5 facts about illegal immigration in the U.S.|website=Pew Research Center|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-27}}</ref>

Narrowing the discussion to only Mexican nationals, a 2015 study performed by demographers of the [[University of Texas at San Antonio]] and the [[University of New Hampshire]] found that immigration from Mexico; both legal and illegal, peaked in 2003 and that from the period between 2003 and 2007 to the period of 2008 to 2012, immigration from Mexico decreased 57%. The dean of the College of Public Policy of the University of Texas at San Antonio, Rogelio Saenz, states that lower birth rates and the growing economy in Mexico slowed emigration, creating more jobs for Mexicans. Saenz also states that Mexican immigrants are no longer coming to find jobs but to flee from violence, noting that the majority of those escaping crime "are far more likely to be naturalized U.S. citizens".<ref>{{cite news|last1=Forsyth|first1=Jim|title=Study: Immigration from Mexico to the US has dropped 57 percent since the mid-2000s|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/r-immigration-to-us-from-mexico-drops-sharply-study-2015-7|access-date=July 23, 2015|agency=[[Business Insider]]|date=July 22, 2015}}</ref>

According to a 2017 National Bureau of Economic Research paper, "The number of undocumented immigrants has declined in absolute terms, while the overall population of low-skilled, foreign-born workers has remained stable. ... because major source countries for U.S. immigration are now seeing and will continue to see weak growth of the labor supply relative to the United States, future immigration rates of young, low-skilled workers appear unlikely to rebound, whether or not U.S. immigration policies tighten further."<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Hanson|first1=Gordon|last2=Liu|first2=Chen|last3=McIntosh|first3=Craig|date=August 2017|title=The Rise and Fall of U.S. Low-Skilled Immigration|journal=Brookings Papers on Economic Activity |volume=2017 |issue=1 |pages=83–168 |jstor=90013169 |doi=10.1353/eca.2017.0001|s2cid=158513921|url=http://www.nber.org/papers/w23753.pdf}}</ref>

===Children===
{{see also|DREAM Act}}
The [[Pew Hispanic Center]] determined that according to an analysis of [[Census Bureau]] data about 8 percent of children born in the United States in 2008—about 340,000—were offspring of illegal immigrants. (The report classifies a child as offspring of illegal immigrants if ''either'' parent is unauthorized.)

In April 2018, then-attorney general of the [[Donald Trump|Trump]] administration [[Jeff Sessions]] announced a family separation policy regarding migrants crossing the U.S. southern border without a visa. Migrants and accompanying family members who had entered the country who were alleged to have entered illegally and were apprehended or turned themselves in to Border Control agents were charged with criminal entry.

===Illegal entry===
{{Main|Illegal entry#United States}}
There are an estimated half million illegal entries into the United States each year.<ref name="modes" /><ref name="autogenerated2" /> The [[Pew Hispanic Center]] estimated that 6–7 million immigrants came to the United States via illegal entry (the rest entering via legal visas allowing a limited stay, but then not leaving when their visa period ended).<ref name=modes/> Illegal border crossings have declined considerably from 2000, when 71,000–220,000 migrants were apprehended each month, to 2018 when 20,000–40,000 migrants were apprehended.<ref name="Qiu 2018"/>

A common means of border crossing is to hire [[People smuggling|people smugglers]] to help them across the border. Those operating on the U.S.-Mexico border are known informally as ''[[coyotaje]]s'' (coyotes), and are often part of extensive criminal networks throughout Mexico.<ref name="autogenerated2"/> Criminal gangs smuggling illegal immigrants from China are known as [[Snakehead (gang)|snakeheads]], and charge as much as U.S.$70,000 per person, which immigrants often promise to pay with money they hope to earn in the United States.<ref>[https://latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-chinese-smuggling5-2009oct05,0,4972825.story "Sharp rise in Chinese arrests at U.S. border"].

===Visa overstay===
A tourist or traveler is considered a "visa overstay" once he or she remains in the United States after the time of admission has expired. The time of admission varies greatly from traveler to traveler depending on the visa class into which they were admitted. According to Pew, between 4 and 5.5 million foreigners entered the United States with a legal [[Visa (document)|visa]], accounting for between 33 and 50% of the total unauthorized migrant population.<ref name=modes/> Visa overstays tend to be somewhat more educated and better off financially than those who entered the country illegally.<ref name="A harder look at visa overstayers"/> In most instances, overstaying a visa is a [[Civil law (common law)|civil]] "wrong" and not necessarily a [[crime]], though the person is still subject to deportation for unlawful presence.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Jacobson |first1=Louis |title=Is being in the United States unlawfully a 'crime'? |url=https://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2017/mar/15/florida-conference-catholic-bishops/being-united-states-unlawfully-crime/ |access-date=January 18, 2020 |work=Politifact |publisher=Tampa Bay Times |date=March 15, 2017 |language=en}}</ref>

To help track visa overstayers the [[US-VISIT (United States Visitor and Immigrant Status Indicator Technology)|U.S.-VISIT (United States Visitor and Immigrant Status Indicator Technology)]] program collects and retains biographic, travel, and biometric information, such as photographs and fingerprints, of foreign nationals seeking entry into the United States. It also requires electronic readable passports containing this information.

Visa overstayers mostly enter with [[B-1/B-2 Visa|tourist or business visas]].<ref name=modes/> In 1994, more than half<ref name="cato"/> of illegal immigrants were Visa overstayers whereas in 2006, about 45% of illegal immigrants were Visa overstayers.<ref name="npr"/>

Those who leave the United States after overstaying their visa for more than 180 days but less than one year, leave and then attempt to apply for readmission will face a three-year ban which will not allow them to re-enter the U.S. for that period. Those who leave the United States after overstaying their visa for a period of one year or longer, leave and then attempt to apply for readmission will face a ten-year ban.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.temple.edu/isss/immigration/overstay.html |title=Immigration &#124; Visa Overstay and Illegal Presence in the US &#124; ISSS &#124; Temple University |access-date=January 16, 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161021205140/http://www.temple.edu/isss/immigration/overstay.html |archive-date=October 21, 2016 |df=mdy }}</ref>

===Border Crossing Card violation===
A smaller number of illegal immigrants entered the United States legally using the [[Border Crossing Card]], a card that authorizes border crossings into the U.S. for a set amount of time. Border Crossing Card entry accounts for the vast majority of all registered non-immigrant entry into the United States—148 million out of 179 million total—but there is little hard data as to how much of the illegal immigrant population entered in this way. The Pew Hispanic Center estimates the number at around 250,000–500,000.<ref name=modes/>

=== In the workforce ===
Illegal immigrants within the workforce are extremely vulnerable due to their status. Being illegal makes these individuals susceptible to exploitation by employers as they are more willing to work through bad conditions and low income jobs — consequently making themselves vulnerable to abuse.<ref name=":32">https://public.ebookcentral.proquest.com/choice/publicfullrecord.aspx?p=3571803</ref> Most illegal migrants end up being hired by U.S. employers who exploit the low-wage market produced through immigration. Typical jobs include: janitorial services, clothing production, and household work.<ref name=":32" />

Many illegal Latin American immigrants are inclined to the labor market because of the constraints they have with their job opportunities. This consequently forms an informal sector within the labor market. As a result, this attachment formulates an ethnic identity for this sector.<ref name=":32" />

Congress passed the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act (PRWORA) in 1996. This prevented federal, state, and local public benefits from flowing to illegal immigrants. It also required federal and state agencies to disclose if someone was illegal. Additionally, PRWORA prohibited states from giving professional licenses to those illegal.<ref name=":82">{{Cite book|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/book/41145/|title=A Conservative and Compassionate Approach to Immigration Reform: Perspectives from a Former US Attorney General|last1=Gonzales|first1=A.R.|last2=Strange|first2=D.N.|last3=Bakken|first3=G.M.|publisher=Texas Tech University Press|year=2014|isbn=9780896728974}}</ref> Though PRWORA prevents public benefits from flowing to illegal immigrants, there are exceptions. Illegal immigrants are still entitled to medical assistance, immunizations, disaster relief, and k-12 education. Despite this, federal law still requires local and state governments to deny benefits to those illegal.<ref name=":82" /> The implementation of PRWORA demonstrated the shift towards personal responsibility over "public dependency."<ref name=":92">{{Cite book|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/book/57966/|title=The Undocumented Everyday: Migrant Lives and the Politics of Visibility|last=Schreiber|first=Rebecca|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|year=2018|isbn=9781452956398|location=Minneapolis}}</ref> There were about eight million undocumented workers in the United States in 2010.

International polls by the Gallup organization from 2013 to 2016 in 156 foreign countries found that about 147 million adults would, if they could, move to the U.S., making it the most-desired destination country for potential migrants worldwide, followed by Germany and Canada.<ref>Neli Esipova, Julie Ray, and Anita Pugliese, [https://news.gallup.com/poll/211883/number-potential-migrants-worldwide-tops-700-million.aspx Number of potential migrants worldwide tops 700 million] Gallup, 8 June 2017.</ref>

===Causes by region===
In general, illegal immigrants from Mexico and Central America come for economic reasons, but also sometimes due to political oppression.<ref name="autogenerated5"/>{{Better source|date=September 2017}} From Asia, they come for economic reasons but some come involuntarily as indentured servants or sex slaves.<ref name="autogenerated5" />{{Better source|date=September 2017}} From Sub-Saharan Africa, the majority come for economic activities.<ref name="autogenerated5" />{{Better source|date=September 2017}} From Eastern Europe, they primarily come for economic activities and to rejoin family already in the United States.

Economic reasons are one motivation for people to illegally immigrate to the United States.<ref name="arizona2007" /><ref name="Chiswick, Barry R. 1988 pp. 101-115" /> United States employers hire illegal immigrants at wages substantially higher than they could earn in their native countries.<ref name="arizona2007">Judith Gans.

According to Judith Gans of the [[University of Arizona]], United States employers are pushed to hire illegal immigrants for three main reasons:<ref name="arizona2007" />
# Global economic change. Global economic change is one cause for illegal immigration because information and transportation technologies now foster internationalized production, distribution and consumption, and labor. This has encouraged many countries to open their economies to outside investment, then increasing the number of low-skilled workers participating in global labor markets and making low-skilled labor markets all more competitive. This and the fact that developed countries have shifted from manufacturing to knowledge-based economies, have realigned economic activity around the world. Labor has become more international as individuals immigrate seeking work, despite governmental attempts to control this migration. Because the United States education system creates relatively few people who either lack a high school diploma or who hold PhDs, there is a shortage of workers needed to fulfill seasonal low-skilled jobs as well as certain high-skilled jobs. To fill these gaps, the United States immigration system attempts to compensate for these shortages by providing for temporary immigration by farm workers and seasonal low-skilled workers, and for permanent immigration by high-skilled workers.
# A lack of legal immigration channels.
# The ineffectiveness of current employer sanctions for illegal hiring. This allows immigrants who are in the country illegally to easily find jobs. There are three reasons for this ineffectiveness—the absence of reliable mechanisms for verifying employment eligibility, inadequate funding of interior immigration enforcement, and the absence of political will due to labor needs to the United States economy. For example, it is unlawful to knowingly hire an illegal immigrant, but according to Judith Gans, there are no reliable mechanisms in place for employers to verify that the immigrants' papers are authentic.
Another reason for the large numbers of illegal immigrants present in the United States is the termination of the [[bracero program]]. This bi-national program between the U.S. and Mexico existed from 1942 to 1964 to supply qualified Mexican laborers as [[guest workers]] to harvest fruits and vegetables in the United States. During World War II, the program benefited the U.S. war effort by replacing citizens' labor in agriculture to serve as soldiers overseas. The program was designed to provide legal flows of qualified laborers to the U.S. Many Mexicans deemed unqualified for the program nonetheless immigrated illegally to the United States to work. In doing that they broke both U.S. and Mexican law.<ref>[[Kelly Lytle Hernández]], "The Crimes and Consequences of Illegal Immigration: A Cross-Border Examination of Operation Wetback, 1943–1954."

===Channels for legal immigration===
The United States immigration system provides channels for legal, permanent economic immigration, especially for high-skilled workers. For low-skilled workers, temporary or seasonal legal immigration is easier to acquire.<ref name="arizona2007"/> The United States immigration system rests on three pillars: family reunification, provision of scarce labor (as in agricultural and specific high-skilled worker sectors), and protecting American workers from competition with foreign workers.<ref name="arizona2007"/> The current system sets an overall limit of 675,000 permanent immigrants each year; this limit does not apply to spouses, unmarried minor children or parents of U.S. citizens.<ref name="cqpress1923">Jost, Kenneth.

===Family reunification===
{{see also|Family reunification|History of laws concerning immigration and naturalization in the United States}}
According to demographer Jeffery Passel of the [[Pew Research Center|Pew Hispanic Center]], the flow of Mexicans to the U.S. has produced a "[[network effect]]"—furthering immigration as Mexicans moved to join relatives already in the U.S.<ref name="Uchitelle"/>

===Further incentives===
Lower costs of transportation, communication and information has facilitated illegal immigration. Mexican nationals, in particular, have a very low financial cost of immigration and can easily cross the border. Even if it requires more than one attempt, they have a very low probability of being detected and then deported once they have entered the country.<ref name="Chiswick, Barry R. 1988 pp. 101-115"/>

==International controversies==

===Mexican federal and state government assistance===
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security and some advocacy groups have criticized a program of the government of the state of [[Yucatán (state)|Yucatán]] and that of a federal Mexican agency directed to Mexicans migrating to and residing in the United States. They state that the assistance includes advice on how to get across the U.S. border illegally, where to find healthcare, enroll their children in public schools, and send money to Mexico. The Mexican federal government also issues [[Consular identification card|identity cards]] to Mexicans living outside of Mexico.<ref name="bbc"/>
* In 2005, the government of Yucatán produced a handbook and DVD about the risks and implications of crossing the U.S.-Mexico border. The guide told immigrants where to find health care, how to get their kids into U.S. schools, and how to send money home. Officials in Yucatán said the guide is a necessity to save lives but some American groups accused the government of encouraging illegal immigration.<ref name="Mexican State Issues 'How To' on Border Jumping"/>
* In 2005, the Mexican government was criticized for distributing a comic book which offers tips to illegal emigrants to the United States.<ref name="ST"/> That comic book recommends to illegal immigrants, once they have safely crossed the border, "Don't call attention to yourself. ... Avoid loud parties. ... Don't become involved in fights." The Mexican government defends the guide as an attempt to save lives. "It's kind of like illegal immigration for dummies," said the executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies in Washington, Mark Krikorian. "Promoting safe illegal immigration is not the same as arguing against it". The comic book does state on its last page that the Mexican Government does not promote illegal crossing at all and only encourages visits to the U.S. with all required documentation.<ref name=ST/>

Aliens can be classified as unlawfully present for one of three reasons: entering without authorization or inspection, staying beyond the authorized period after legal entry, or violating the terms of legal entry.<ref name="The New Americans: Economic, Demographic, and Fiscal Effects of Immigration"/>

===Improper entry===
Section 1325 in [[Title 8 of the United States Code]], "Improper entry of alien", provides for a fine, imprisonment, or both for any non-citizen who:<ref name="cornell"/>

{{quote|
# enters or attempts to enter the United States at any time or place other than as designated by immigration agents, or
# eludes examination or inspection by immigration agents, or
# attempts to enter or obtains entry to the United States by a willfully false or misleading representation or the willful concealment of a material fact.}}

The maximum prison term is 6 months for the first offense with a [[misdemeanor]] and 2 years for any subsequent offense with a [[felony]]. In addition to the above criminal fines and penalties, civil fines may also be imposed.

===Visa overstay===
Unlike illegal entry (which is a criminal offense in the United States), it is not a criminal offense for an alien to enter the United States legally and then overstay his or her visa.<ref name=Jarrett>Laura Jarrett, [https://www.cnn.com/2017/02/24/politics/undocumented-immigrants-not-necessarily-criminal/index.html Are undocumented immigrants committing a crime?

===Federal versus state role===
The federal government has primary responsibility for immigration enforcement in the United States.<ref>Megan Davy, Deborah W. Meyers & Jeanne Batalova, [https://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/who-does-what-us-immigration Who Does What in U.S. Immigration], ''Migration Information Source'', Migration Policy institute (December 1, 2005).</ref><ref>Jessica Saunders, Nelson Lim & Don Prosnitz, [https://www.rand.org/pubs/occasional_papers/OP273.html Enforcing Immigration Law at the State and Local Levels: A Public Policy Dilemma], RAND Corporation (2010).</ref>

In April 2010, Arizona passed [[Arizona SB 1070|SB 1070]], at the time the broadest and strictest anti-illegal immigration bill in the United States.<ref name="nyt-az-law" /> and was challenged by the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] as encroaching on powers reserved by the United States Constitution to the Federal Government.<ref name="nyt-az-law"/> In July 2010, a [[United States District Court for the District of Arizona|federal district court]] issued a preliminary injunction affecting the most controversial parts of the law, including the section that required police officers to check a person's immigration status after a person had been involved in another act or situation which resulted in police activity.<ref name="archibold"/> The case came to the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] in ''[[Arizona v. United States]]'' (2012).  The Court unanimously sustained the law's central and most controversial requirement, requiring state law enforcement officials "to determine the immigration status of anyone they stop or arrest if they have reason to suspect that the individual might be in the country illegally"—a clause called the "show me your papers" provision by opponents.<ref name=Liptak>Adam Liptak [https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/26/us/supreme-court-rejects-part-of-arizona-immigration-law.html Blocking Parts of Arizona Law, Justices Allow Its Centerpiece], ''New York Times'' (June 26, 2012).</ref> The Court, however, indicated that future legal challenges to the provision could still be pursued based on, for example, allegations of [[racial profiling]] in the use of the clause.<ref name=Liptak/> The Court also struck down as unconstitutional, by a 5—3 vote, provisions of the Arizona law making it a criminal offense for illegal immigrants to work or seek employment and permitting police to make [[Arrest warrant|warrantless arrests]] if them had [[probable cause]] to believe that the arrestee had done an act that would render him or her deportable under federal law"; and struck down as unconstitutional, by a 6—2 vote, a clause of the Arizona law that made it a state crime for immigrants to fail to register with the federal government.<ref name=Liptak/>

In 2016, Arizona reached a settlement with a number of immigrants rights organizations, including the [[National Immigration Law Center]], overturning the part of the law providing for police to demand papers from persons they suspected of being illegally present in the United States. The practice had led to racial profiling of Latinos and other minorities.<ref name="la times">{{cite news|last1=Duara|first1=Nigel|title=Arizona's Once-Feared Immigration Law, SB 1070, Loses Most of Its Power in Settlement|url=https://latimes.com/nation/la-na-arizona-law-20160915-snap-story.html|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=September 15, 2017}}</ref> The ''Los Angeles Times'' reported that the settlement "pulls the last set of teeth from what was once the nation's most fearsome immigration law."<ref name="la times"/>

===Employment===
Illegal immigrants are generally not allowed to receive state or local public benefits, which includes [[professional licensure in the United States|professional licenses]].<ref>{{USC|8|1621}}</ref> However, in 2013 the [[California State Legislature]] passed laws allowing illegal immigrants to obtain professional licenses. On February 1, 2014. [[Sergio C. Garcia]] became the first illegal immigrant to be admitted to the [[State Bar of California]] since 2008, when applicants were first required to list citizenship status on bar applications.<ref>{{cite news|last=Medina|first=Jennifer|title=Allowed to Join the Bar, but Not to Take a Job|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/03/us/immigrant-in-us-illegally-may-practice-law-california-court-rules.html|access-date=June 1, 2014|newspaper=The New York Times|date=January 2, 2014}}</ref>

===Apprehension===

[[Federal law enforcement in the United States|Federal law enforcement agencies]], specifically [[U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement]] (ICE), the [[United States Border Patrol]] (U.S.BP), and [[U.S. Customs and Border Protection]] (CBP), enforce the [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952]] (INA), and to some extent, the [[United States Armed Forces]], [[List of United States state and local law enforcement agencies|state and local law enforcement agencies]], and civilians and civilian groups guard the border.

====At workplace====
Before 2007, immigration authorities alerted employers of mismatches between reported employees' [[Social Security number|Social Security cards]] and the actual names of the card holders. In September 2007, a federal judge halted this practice of alerting employers of card mismatches.<ref name="nytimes4"/>

At times illegal hiring has not been prosecuted aggressively: between 1999 and 2003, according to ''[[The Washington Post]]'', "work-site enforcement operations were scaled back 95 percent by the [[Immigration and Naturalization Service]].<ref name="washingtonpost"/> Major employers of illegal immigrants have included:
* [[Wal-Mart]]: In 2005, Wal-Mart agreed to pay $11 million to settle a federal investigation that found hundreds of illegal immigrants were hired by Wal-Mart's cleaning contractors.<ref name="washingtonpost5"/>
* [[Swift & Co.]]: In December 2006, in the largest such crackdown in American history, U.S. federal immigration authorities [[Swift raids|raided Swift & Co. meat-processing plants]] in six U.S. states, arresting about 1,300 illegal immigrant employees.<ref name="usatoday"/>

===Deportation===
{{main|Deportation and removal from the United States}}
Deportations of immigrants, which are also referred to as [[Deportation and removal from the United States|removals]], may be issued when immigrants are found to be in violation of U.S. immigration laws. Deportations may be imposed on a person who is neither native-born nor a naturalized citizen of the United States.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/158282/deportation|title=deportation (law) – Britannica Online Encyclopedia|encyclopedia=Britannica.com|access-date=November 5, 2012}}</ref>
Deportation proceedings are also referred to as [[removal proceedings]] and are typically initiated by the Department of Homeland Security. The United States issues deportations for various reasons which include security, protection of resources, and protection of jobs.

Deportations from the United States increased by more than 60 percent from 2003 to 2008, with Mexicans accounting for nearly two-thirds of those deported.<ref name="Mexicans deported from US face shattered lives"/> Under the [[presidency of Barack Obama|Obama administration]], deportations have increased to record levels beyond the level reached by the [[presidency of George W. Bush|George W. Bush administration]] with a projected 400,000 deportations in 2010, 10 percent above the deportation rate of 2008 and 25 percent above 2007.<ref name="deportations 2010"/> [[Fiscal year#United States|Fiscal year]] 2011 saw 396,906 deportations, the largest number in the history of [[U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement]]; of those, about 55% had been convicted of crimes or misdemeanors, including: 44,653 convicted of [[drug-related crime]]s, 35,927 convicted of [[driving under the influence]], 5,848 convicted of [[sexual offense]]s, and 1,119 convicted of [[homicide]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/10/18/us/immigrant-deportations/|title=U.S. deportations reach historic levels|author=Jim Barnett|date=October 18, 2011|access-date=October 18, 2011|publisher=CNN}}</ref>

By the end of 2012, as many people had been deported during the first four years of the Obama presidency as were deported during the eight-year presidency of George W. Bush;<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/23/us/advocates-push-obama-to-halt-aggressive-deportation-efforts.html ''The New York Times'': "Seeing Citizenship Path Near, Activists Push Obama to Slow Deportations" by Michael D.

====The AEDPA and IIRIRA Acts of 1996====
Two major pieces of legislation passed in 1996 had a significant effect on illegal immigration and deportations in the United States; the [[Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act]] (AEDPA) and the [[Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act]] (IIRIRA). These were introduced following the [[1993 World Trade Center bombing]] and the 1995 [[Oklahoma City bombing]], both of which were terrorist attacks that claimed American lives. These two acts changed the way criminal cases of lawful permanent residents were handled, resulting in increased deportations from the United States.<ref name="jstor1">{{Cite journal|year=2000|title=Understanding the Impact of the 1996 Deportation Laws and the Limited Scope of Proposed Reforms|journal=Harvard Law Review|volume=113|issue=8|pages=1936–62|doi=10.2307/1342314|jstor=1342314|last1=Morawetz|first1=N.}}</ref> Before the 1996 deportation laws, there were two steps that lawful permanent noncitizen residents who were convicted of crimes went through. The first step determined whether or not the person was deportable. The second step determined if that person should or shouldn't be deported. Before the 1996 deportation laws, the second step prevented many permanent residents from being deported by allowing for their cases to be reviewed in full before issuing deportations. External factors were taken into consideration such as the effect deportation would have on a person's family members and a person's connections with their country of origin. Under this system permanent residents were able to be relieved of deportation if their situation deemed it unnecessary. The 1996 laws however issued many deportations under the first step, without going through the second step, resulting in a great increase in deportations.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

One significant change that resulted from the new laws was the definition of the term ''aggravated felony''. Being convicted of a crime that is categorized as an aggravated felony results in mandatory detention and deportation. The new definition of aggravated felony includes crimes such as shoplifting, which would be a [[misdemeanor]] in many states. The new laws have categorized a much wider range of crimes as aggravated felonies. The effect of this has been a large increase in permanent residents facing mandatory deportation from the United States without the opportunity to plea for relief. The 1996 deportation laws have received a lot of criticism for their curtailing of residents' rights.<ref name="jstor1"/>

====The U.S.A Patriot Act====
The [[USA Patriot Act|U.S.A Patriot Act]] was passed seven weeks after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. The purpose of the act was to give the government more power to act upon suspicion of terrorist activity. The new governmental powers granted by this act included a significant expansion of the conditions in which illegal immigrants could be deported based on suspicion of terrorist activity. The act gave the government the power to deport individuals based not only on plots or acts of terrorism, but on affiliations with certain organizations. The Secretary of State designated specific organizations ''foreign terrorist organizations'' before the U.S.A Patriot Act was implemented. Organizations on this list were deemed dangerous because they were actively involved in terrorist activity. The Patriot Act created a type of organization called ''designated'' organizations. The Secretary of State and Attorney General were given the power to designate any organization that supported terrorist activity on any level. The act also allows for deportation based on involvement in undesignated organizations that were deemed suspicious.<ref>{{Cite journal|year=2003|title=Patriotic or Unconstitutional? The Mandatory Detention of Aliens under the USA Patriot Act|journal=Stanford Law Review|volume=55|issue=4|pages=1419–56|jstor=1229608|last1=Sinnar|first1=S.}}</ref>

Under the U.S.A Patriot Act the Attorney General was granted the power to "certify" illegal immigrants that pose a threat to national security. Once an illegal immigrant is certified they must be taken into custody and face mandatory detention which will result in a criminal charge or release. The Patriot Act has been criticized for violating the [[Due Process Clause|Fifth Amendment right to due process]]. Under the Patriot Act, an illegal immigrant is not granted the opportunity for a hearing before given certification.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?collection=journals&handle=hein.journals/hjl39&div=21&id=&page= |title=39 ''Harvard Journal on Legislation'' 2002 "USA Patriot Act Recent Developments" |publisher=Heinonline.org |access-date=November 5, 2012}}</ref>

====Complications of birthright citizen children and illegal immigrant parents====
Complications in deportation efforts ensue when parents are illegal immigrants but their children are [[Birthright citizenship in the United States of America|birthright citizens]]. Federal appellate courts have upheld the refusal by the Immigration and Naturalization Service to stay the deportation of illegal immigrants merely on the grounds that they have U.S.-citizen, minor children.<ref name="CRSReport"/> As of 2005, there were some 3.1 million United States citizen children living in families in which the head of the family or a spouse was unauthorized;<ref name="The Size and Characteristics of the Unauthorized Migrant Population in the US"/> at least 13,000 children had one or both parents deported in the years 2005–2007.<ref name="The Size and Characteristics of the Unauthorized Migrant Population in the US"/>{{Failed verification|date=June 2018}}

===DREAM Act===
The [[DREAM Act]] (acronym for Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors) was an American legislative proposal for a multi-phase process for illegal immigrants in the United States that would first grant conditional residency and upon meeting further qualifications, permanent residency. The bill was first introduced in the Senate on August 1, 2001 and has since been reintroduced several times but did not pass. It was intended to stop the deportation of people who had arrived as children and had grown up in the U.S. The Act would give lawful permanent residency under certain conditions which include: good moral character, enrollment in a secondary or post-secondary education program, and having lived in the United States at least 5 years. Those in opposition of the DREAM Act believe that it encourages illegal immigration.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?collection=journals&handle=hein.journals/stflr55&div=61&id=&page=|title=55 Stanford Law Review 2002–2003 Patriotic or Unconstitutional – The Mandatory Detention of Aliens under the USA Patriot Act Note|journal=Stanford Law Review|volume=55|pages=1419|access-date=November 5, 2012|date=2003|last1=Sinnar|first1=Shirin}}</ref>

Although the DREAM Act has not been enacted by federal legislation, a number of its provisions were implemented by a memorandum issued by [[Janet Napolitano]] of the [[Department of Homeland Security]]  during the Obama administration. To be eligible for [[Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals]] (DACA), one must show that they were under 31 years of age {{as of|2012|June|15|lc=y|df=US}}; that they came to the United States before their 16th birthday; that they have continuously resided in the United States from June 15, 2007, until the present; that they were physically present in the United States on June 15, 2012, and at the time they applied for DACA; that they were not authorized to be in the United States on June 15, 2012; that they are currently in school, have graduated or obtained a certificate of completion from high school, have obtained a general education development (GED) certificate, or are an honorably discharged veteran of the Coast Guard or Armed Forces of the United States; and that they have not been convicted of a felony, significant misdemeanor, three or more other misdemeanors, and do not otherwise pose a threat to national security or public safety.<ref>For more information please visit {{cite web |url=http://www.hannafordimmigration.com/immigration-services/humanitarian-visa-types/#DACA |title=Humanitarian Visas |access-date=October 4, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151020163517/http://www.hannafordimmigration.com/immigration-services/humanitarian-visa-types/#DACA |archive-date=October 20, 2015 |df=mdy }}</ref>

There have been two major periods of mass deportations in U.S. history. In the [[Mexican Repatriation]] of the 1930s, through mass deportations and forced migration, an estimated 500,000 Mexicans and Mexican Americans were deported or coerced into emigrating, in what Mae Ngai, an immigration historian at the University of Chicago, has described as "a racial removal program".<ref name="usatodaymexrepat" /> The majority of those removed were U.S. citizens.<ref name="usatodaymexrepat" /> Rep. Luis Gutierrez, D-Ill., cosponsor of a U.S. House Bill that calls for a commission to study the "deportation and coerced emigration" of U.S. citizens and legal residents, has expressed concerns that history could repeat itself, and that should illegal immigration be made into a felony, this could prompt a "massive deportation of U.S. citizens".<ref name="usatodaymexrepat" />

In [[Operation Wetback]] in 1954, the United States and the Mexican governments cooperated to deport illegal immigrant Mexicans in the U.S. to Mexico. This cooperation was part of more harmonious [[Mexico-United States relations]] starting in World War II. Joint border policing operations were established in the 1940s when the [[Bracero Program]] (1942–1964) brought qualified Mexicans to the U.S. as [[guest workers]]. Many Mexicans who did not qualify for the program migrated illegally. According to Mexican law, Mexican workers needed authorization to accept employment in the U.S. As Mexico industrialized post-World War II in what was called the [[Mexican Miracle]], Mexico wanted to preserve "one of its greatest natural resources, a cheap and flexible labor supply."<ref>Kelly Lytle Hernádez, "The Crimes and Consequences of Illegal Immigration: A Cross-Border Examination of Operation Wetback, 1943–1954," ''The Western Historical Quarterly'', vol. 37, no. 4, (Winter 2006), p. 425.</ref> In some cases along with their U.S. born children ([[Birthright citizenship in the United States|who are citizens according to U.S. law]]),<ref name="pbsborder" /> some illegal immigrants, fearful of potential violence as police swarmed through Mexican American barrios throughout the southeastern states, stopping "Mexican-looking" citizens on the street and asking for identification, fled to Mexico.<ref name="pbsborder" />

In 1986, President Ronald Reagan signed the [[Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986|Immigration Reform and Control Act]] that gave amnesty to 3 million illegal immigrants in the country.<ref>"A Reagan Legacy: Amnesty For Illegal Immigrants". NPR: National Public Radio. July 4, 2010

A direct effect of the deportation laws of 1996 and the Patriot Act has been a dramatic increase in deportations. Prior to these acts deportations had remained at about an average of 20,000 per year. Between 1990 and 1995 deportations had increased to about an average of 40,000 a year. From 1996 to 2005 the yearly average had increased to over 180,000. In the year 2005 the number of deportations reached 208,521 with less than half being deported under criminal grounds.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Hagan | first1 = J. | last2 = Eschbach | first2 = K. | last3 = Rodriguez | first3 = N. | title = U.S. Deportation Policy, Family Separation, and Circular Migration | doi = 10.1111/j.1747-7379.2007.00114.x | journal = International Migration Review | volume = 42 | page = 64 | year = 2008 | s2cid = 145761772 }}</ref> According to a June 2013 report published by the [[Washington Office on Latin America]], dangerous deportation practices are on the rise and pose a serious threat to the safety of the migrants being deported.

A study in 2005 by the [[Center for American Progress]], a liberal think tank, estimated that the cost of forcibly removing most of the nation's illegal immigrants (then estimated to be about 10 million) would be $41 billion a year, more than the entire annual budget of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.<ref name="washingtonpost7" /> The study estimated that the cost over five years would be between $206 billion to $230 billion, depending on how many departed voluntarily.<ref name="washingtonpost7" />  A 2017 study published in the ''[[Journal on Migration and Human Security]]'' found that a mass-deportation program would create immense social and economic costs, including a cumulative GDP reduction of $4.7 trillion over a decade; damage to the U.S. housing market (because an estimated 1.2 million mortgages are held by households that include one or more undocumented immigrants); and a 47% drop in the median household income for the U.S.'s estimated 3.3 million "mixed-status" households (household that include at least one undocumented immigrant and at least one U.S. citizen), which would result in a major increase in poverty.<ref>Robert Warren & Donald Kerwin, [https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/233150241700500101 Mass Deportations Would Impoverish US Families and Create Immense Social Costs], ''Journal on Migration and Human Security'', Vol. 5, No. 1 (2017), pp. 1-8.</ref>

===Military involvement===
In 1995, the [[United States Congress]] considered an exemption from the [[Posse Comitatus Act]], which generally prohibits direct participation of [[United States Army|U.S. soldiers]] and [[United States Air Force|airmen]] (and [[United States Navy|sailors]] and [[United States Marine Corps|Marines]] by policy of the [[United States Department of the Navy|Department of the Navy]]) in domestic law enforcement activities, such as search, seizure, and arrests.<ref name="uscg" />

In 1997, Marines shot and killed 18-year-old U.S. citizen [[Esequiel Hernández Jr]]<ref name="time" /> while on a mission to interdict smuggling and illegal immigration near the border community of [[Redford, Texas]]. The Marines observed the high school student from concealment while he was tending his family's goats in the vicinity of their ranch. At one point, Hernandez raised his [[.22 Long Rifle|.22-caliber]] rifle and fired shots in the direction of the concealed soldiers. He was subsequently tracked for 20 minutes then shot and killed.<ref name="On the Border" /><ref name="ballad" /> In reference to the incident, military lawyer Craig T. Trebilcock argues, "the fact that armed military troops were placed in a position with the mere possibility that they would have to use force to subdue civilian criminal activity reflects a significant policy shift by the executive branch away from the posse comitatus doctrine."<ref name="homelandsecurity" /> The killing of Hernandez led to a congressional review<ref name="dpft" /> and an end to a nine-year-old policy of the military aiding the Border Patrol.<ref name="dpft8" />

After the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001, the United States again considered placing soldiers along the U.S.–Mexico border as a security measure.<ref name="pitt" /> In May 2006, President [[George W. Bush]] announced plans to use the [[United States National Guard|National Guard]] to strengthen enforcement of the [[US-Mexico Border|U.S.-Mexico Border]] from illegal immigrants,<ref name="washingtonpost9" /> emphasizing that Guard units "will not be involved in direct law enforcement activities".<ref name="archives" /> Mexican Foreign Secretary Luis Ernesto Derbez said in an interview with a Mexico City radio station, "If we see the National Guard starting to directly participate in detaining people ... we would immediately start filing lawsuits through our consulates."<ref name="newsmax" />
The [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU) called on the President not to deploy troops to deter illegal immigrants, and stated that a "deployment of National Guard troops violates the spirit of the Posse Comitatus Act".<ref name="aclu" /> According to the [[State of the Union address]] in January 2007,<ref name="archives10" /> more than 6,000 National Guard members have been sent to the border to supplement the Border Patrol,<ref name="archives11" /> costing in excess of $750 million.<ref name="sfgate" />

In 2014, 'Dreamer Moms' began protesting, hoping that President Obama will grant them legal status. On November 12, 2014, there was a hunger strike near the White House undertaken by the group Dreamer Moms. On November 21, 2014, Obama provided 5 million illegal immigrants legal status because he said that mass deportation "would be both impossible and contrary to our character." However, this decision was challenged in court during the Trump administration and then overturned.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/dreamer-moms-fast-near-white-house-hoping-obama-will-grant-them-legal-status/2014/11/14/13a5f622-69bb-11e4-a31c-77759fc1eacc_story.html|title='Dreamer Moms' fast near White House, hoping Obama will grant them legal status|date=November 12, 2014|newspaper=The Washington Post}}</ref>

In a 2017 literature review by the [[National Academy of Sciences]], they explain the positive impact of illegal immigrants on natives in the following way:<ref name="Economic and Fiscal 2016"/>

<blockquote>The entry of new workers through migration increases the likelihood of filling a vacant position quickly and thus reduces the net cost of posting new offers. The fact that immigrants in each skill category earn less than natives reinforces this effect. Though immigrants compete with natives for these additional jobs, the overall number of new positions employers choose to create is larger than the number of additional entrants to the labor market. The effect is to lower the unemployment rate and to strengthen the bargaining position of workers.</blockquote>

According to Georgetown University economist Anna Maria Mayda and University of California, Davis economist Giovanni Peri, "deportation of undocumented immigrants not only threatens the day-to-day life of several million people, it also undermines the economic viability of entire sectors of the U.S. economy." Research shows that illegal immigrants complement and extend middle- and high-skilled American workers, making it possible for those sectors to employ more Americans. Without access to illegal immigrants, U.S. firms would be incentivized to [[offshoring|offshore]] jobs and import foreign-produced goods. Several highly competitive sectors that depend disproportionately on illegal immigrant labor, such as agriculture, would dramatically shrink and sectors, such as hospitality and food services, would see higher prices for consumers. Regions and cities that have large illegal populations are also likely to see harms to the local economy were the illegal immigrant population removed. While Mayda and Peri note that some low-skilled American workers would see marginal gains, it is likely that the effects on net job creation and wages would be negative for the U.S. as a whole.<ref name="Mayda 2017">{{Cite encyclopedia|url=http://giovanniperi.ucdavis.edu/uploads/5/6/8/2/56826033/ageoftrump_june2017.pdf#page=70|last1=Mayda|first1=Anna Maria|last2=Peri|first2=Giovanni|title=The economic impact of US immigration policies in the Age of Trump|encyclopedia=Economics and Policy in the Age of Trump|editor-last=Bown|editor-first=Chad P.|publisher=VoxEU.org|pages=69–77|date=June 2017}}</ref>

A 2002 study of the effects of illegal immigration and border enforcement on wages in border communities from 1990 to 1997 found little impact of border enforcement on wages in U.S. border cities, and concluded that their findings were consistent with two hypotheses, "border enforcement has a minimal impact on illegal immigration, and illegal immigration from Mexico has a minimal impact on wages in U.S. border cities".<ref name="HansonRobertson2002">{{cite journal|last2=Robertson|first2=Raymond|last3=Spilimbergo|first3=Antonio|year=2002|title=Does Border Enforcement Protect U.S. Workers from Illegal Immigration?|journal=Review of Economics and Statistics|volume=84|issue=1|pages=73–92|doi=10.1162/003465302317331937|issn=0034-6535|last1=Hanson|first1=Gordon H.|url=http://www.escholarship.org/uc/item/5ff066m2}}</ref>

According to University of California, San Diego economist [[Gordon Hanson|Gordon H. Hanson]], "there is little evidence that legal immigration is economically preferable to illegal immigration. In fact, illegal immigration responds to market forces in ways that legal immigration does not. Illegal migrants tend to arrive in larger numbers when the U.S. economy is booming (relative to Mexico and the Central American countries that are the source of most illegal immigration to the United States) and move to regions where job growth is strong. Legal immigration, in contrast, is subject to arbitrary selection criteria and bureaucratic delays, which tend to disassociate legal inflows from U.S. labor-market conditions. Over the last half-century, there appears to be little or no response of legal immigration to the U.S. unemployment rate."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cfr.org/report/economic-logic-illegal-immigration|title=The Economic Logic of Illegal Immigration|website=Council on Foreign Relations|language=en|access-date=2017-08-22}}</ref>

While the aggregate fiscal effects are beneficial to the United States, unauthorized immigration has small but net negative fiscal effects on state and local governments.<ref name="CBO 2007"/> According to the 2017 National Academy of Science report on immigration, one reason for the adverse fiscal impact on state and local governments is that "the federal government reimburses state and local entities a fraction of costs to incarcerate criminal aliens, the remaining costs are borne by local governments."<ref name="Economic and Fiscal 2016"/>

A paper in the peer-reviewed journal ''Tax Lawyer'' from the [[American Bar Association]] concluded that illegal immigrants contribute more in taxes than they cost in social services.<ref name="Taxing Undocumented Immigrants: Separate, Unequal and Without Representation" />

A 2016 study found that, over the period 2000–2011, illegal immigrants contributed $2.2 to $3.8 billion more to the Medicare Trust Fund "than they withdrew annually (a total surplus of $35.1 billion).

===Mortgages===
Around 2005, an increasing number of banks saw illegal immigrants as an untapped resource for growing their own revenue stream and contended that providing illegal immigrants with mortgages would help revitalize local communities, with many community banks providing home loans for illegal immigrants. At the time, critics complained that this practice would reward and encourage illegal immigration, as well as contribute to an increase in predatory lending practices. One banking consultant said that banks which were planning to offer mortgages to illegal immigrants were counting on the fact that immigration enforcement was very lax, with deportation unlikely for anyone who had not committed a crime.<ref name="cnn" />

After the Obama administration reduced federal immigration enforcement, Democratic counties reduced their immigration enforcement more than Republican counties; a paper by a University of Pennsylvania PhD candidate found "that Democratic counties with higher non-citizen population shares saw greater increases in clearance rates, a measure of policing efficiency, with no increase in crime rates. The results indicate that reducing immigration enforcement did not increase crime and rather led to an increase in policing efficiency, either because it allowed police to focus efforts on solving more serious crimes or because it elicited greater cooperation of non-citizens with police."<ref name="Ciancio 2017"/> A 2003 paper by two [[Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas]] economists found "that while the volume of illegal immigration is not related to changes in property-related crime, there is a significant positive correlation with the incidence of violent crime. This is most likely due to extensive smuggling activity along the border. Border enforcement meanwhile is significantly negatively related to crime rates. The bad news is that the deterrent effect of the border patrol diminishes over this time period, and the net impact of more enforcement on border crime since the late 1990s is zero."<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Coronado|first1=Roberto|last2=Orrenius|first2=Pia M.|date=2003|title=The impact of illegal immigration and enforcement on border crime rates|url=https://ideas.repec.org/p/fip/feddwp/03-03.html}}</ref>

==Harm to illegal immigrants==
There are significant dangers associated with illegal immigration including potential [[Immigrant deaths along the U.S.-Mexico border|death when crossing the border]]. Since the 1994 implementation of an immigration-control effort called [[Operation Gatekeeper]], immigrants have attempted to cross the border in more dangerous locations.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/opinion/commentary/story/2019-09-30/operation-gatekeeper-ended-chaos-at-border-utak|title=Commentary: How 1994's Operation Gatekeeper made Border Patrol better and ended the 'chaos'|last=MARTIN|first=JERRY “BRIAN”|date=2019-10-01|newspaper=[[San Diego Union-Tribune]]|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-01}}</ref><ref name="inmotionmagazine"/> Those crossing the border come unprepared, without food, water, proper clothing, or protection from the elements or dangerous animals; sometimes the immigrants are abandoned by those smuggling them.<ref name="inmotionmagazine"/> Deaths also occur while resisting arrest. In May 2010, the National Human Rights Commission in Mexico accused Border Patrol agents of tasering illegal immigrant [[Death of Anastasio Hernández-Rojas|Anastasio Hernández-Rojas]] to death.

===Exploitation by employers===

{{see also|Human trafficking in the United States}}
Many Mexican immigrants have been trafficked by either their smugglers or the employers after they have gotten to the United States.  According to research at [[San Diego State University]], approximately 6% of illegal Mexican immigrants were trafficked by their smugglers while entering the United States and 28% were trafficked by their employers after entering the United States. Trafficking rates were particularly high in the construction and cleaning industries. They also determined that 55% of illegal Mexican immigrants were abused or exploited by either their smugglers or employers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/grants/240223.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160729070836/https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/grants/240223.pdf|url-status=dead|title=Looking for a Hidden Population: Trafficking of Migrant Laborers in San Diego County|archive-date=July 29, 2016|access-date=May 21, 2020}}</ref>

===Death===

==Cultural references==
A number of films and at least one novel tell stories based on the infamous voyage of the [[Golden Venture]], a ship carrying would-be illegal immigrants from China that ran aground in New York Harbour in 1993.

===Commercial films===
The 1996 film ''[[Deadly Voyage]]'' treats the perils endured by would-be immigrants attempting to enter the United States illegally.<ref>{{cite news |last=O'Connor |first=John J. |date=14 June 1996 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/06/14/arts/tv-weekend-9-african-stowaways-and-a-homicidal-crew.html?pagewanted=1 |title=TV Weeknd; 9 African Stowaways And a Homicidal Crew |work=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref>

===Documentary films===
''[[How Democracy Works Now: Twelve Stories]]'' is a 12-part documentary film series that examines the American political system through the lens of [[immigration reform]] from 2001 to 2007, from filmmaking team [[Shari Robertson]] and [[Michael Camerini]]. Several films in the series contain a large focus on the issue of illegal immigration in the U.S. and feature advocates from both sides of the debate. Since the debut of the first five films, the series has become an important resource for advocates, policy-makers and educators.<ref name="typepad"/>

The series premiered on [[HBO#Documentaries|HBO]] with the broadcast debut of ''The Senator's Bargain'' on March 24, 2010. A directors' cut of ''The Senator's Bargain'' was featured in the 2010 [[Human Rights Watch|Human Rights Watch Film Festival at Lincoln Center]], with the theatrical title ''Story 12: Last Best Chance''. That film featured Edward Kennedy's efforts to pass [[Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2007|The Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2007]]. The second story in the 12-part series, ''Mountains and Clouds'', opened the festival in the same year.

The films document the attempt to pass comprehensive immigration reform during the years from 2001 to 2007, and present a behind-the-scenes story of the success (and failure) of many bills from that period with an effect on illegal immigration including:
* The [[DREAM Act]]
* [[REAL ID Act]]
* [[Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2007]]
* [[Secure America and Orderly Immigration Act]]

''Marking Up The Dream'', Story Six in the ''How Democracy Works Now'' series, focuses on the heated 2003 markup in [[United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary|The Senate Judiciary Committee]], contrasting optimistic supporters who viewed The DREAM Act as a small bi-partisan bill that would help children, with opponents who saw the legislation as thinly-veiled amnesty. Also presented in the film are the [[2006 United States immigration reform protests|rallies and demonstrations]] from illegal immigrant students who would benefit from the DREAM Act. The film opens with demonstration by some illegal high-school students as they stage a mock graduation ceremony on the [[United States Capitol#Grounds|U.S. Capitol lawn]].
