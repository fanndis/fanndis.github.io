On December 31, 2016, Xerox separated its business process service operations, essentially those operations acquired with the purchase of Affiliated Computer Services, into a new publicly traded company, [[Conduent]]. Xerox focuses on its document technology and document outsourcing business, and continues to trade on the [[NYSE]].

Researchers at Xerox and its [[PARC (company)|Palo Alto Research Center]] invented several important elements of [[personal computing]], such as the [[desktop metaphor]] [[graphical user interface|GUI]], the [[computer mouse]]<ref>[http://www.newlaunches.com/archives/the_first_computer_mouse.php The first computer mouse] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203115751/http://newlaunches.com/archives/the_first_computer_mouse.php |date=February 3, 2014 }} New Launches.

Retrieved September 21, 2012.</ref>  The concepts were adopted by Apple and later [[Microsoft]].  Xerox released the 6085 desktop publishing system in 1986, before IBM and Microsoft, but an inferior operating system, obsolete hard drive (a 20 MB drive weighed over 40 lbs/18 kg), and weak software (documents paginated at one per second) doomed the model, as Apple and Microsoft's hardware and OS software offered much greater functionality.  Xerox also released a 4045 desktop laser printer whose cartridges could print 50,000 pages (instead of 5,000), but the model never caught on, and Xerox abandoned future efforts to focus more on its core businesses.{{cn|date=December 2019}}

==History==
Xerox was founded in 1906 in Rochester, New York, as '''The Haloid Photographic Company'''.<ref name="xeroxhaloid">[http://www.xerox.com/go/xrx/template/019d.jsp?view=Factbook&id=XAG&Xcntry=USA&Xlang=en_US Online Fact Book: Xerox at a Glance] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090805182953/http://www.xerox.com/go/xrx/template/019d.jsp?view=Factbook&id=XAG&Xcntry=USA&Xlang=en_US |date=August 5, 2009 }}, xerox.com. Article retrieved December 13, 2006.</ref> It manufactured photographic paper and equipment.

In 1938, [[Chester Carlson]], a physicist working independently, invented a process for printing images using an electrically charged photoconductor-coated metal plate<ref name="USPTO02297691">{{cite web|last1=Carlson|first1=Chester|title=Electrophotography|url=http://pdfpiw.uspto.gov/.piw?Docid=02297691|website=pdfpiw.uspto.gov|publisher=USPTO|accessdate=19 February 2017|archive-date=February 20, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170220095620/http://pdfpiw.uspto.gov/.piw?Docid=02297691|url-status=live}}</ref> and dry powder "toner". However, it would take more than 20 years of refinement before the first automated machine to make copies was commercialized, using a document feeder, scanning light, and a [[pellet drum|rotating drum]].

[[Joseph C. Wilson (entrepreneur)|Joseph C. Wilson]], credited as the "founder of Xerox", took over Haloid from his father. He saw the promise of Carlson's invention and, in 1946, signed an agreement to develop it as a commercial product. Wilson remained as President/CEO of Xerox until 1967 and served as Chairman until his death in 1971.

Looking for a term to differentiate its new system, Haloid coined the term [[xerography]] from two Greek roots meaning "dry writing".
Haloid changed its name to Haloid Xerox in 1958 and then Xerox Corporation in 1961.<ref name="xeroxname">[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/07/business/07cnd-adco.html "Xerox Hopes Its New Logo Doesn't Say 'Copier'"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170219173507/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/07/business/07cnd-adco.html |date=February 19, 2017 }}, NYT.com.

Before releasing the 914, Xerox tested the market by introducing a developed version of the prototype hand-operated equipment known as the Flat-plate 1385. The 1385 was not actually a viable copier because of its slowness of operation. As a consequence, it was sold as a platemaker for the [[Addressograph|Addressograph-Multigraph]] Multilith 1250 and related sheet-fed offset printing presses in the [[offset lithography]] market. It was little more than a high quality, commercially available plate camera mounted as a horizontal [[rostrum camera]], complete with photo-flood lighting and timer. The glass film/plate had been replaced with a selenium-coated aluminum plate. Clever electrics turned this into a quick developing and reusable substitute for film. A skilled user could produce fast, paper and metal printing plates of a higher quality than almost any other method. Having started as a supplier to the offset lithography duplicating industry, Xerox now set its sights on capturing some of offset's market share.

The 1385 was followed by the first automatic xerographic printer, the Copyflo, in 1955. The Copyflo was a large microfilm printer which could produce positive prints on roll paper from any type of microfilm negative. Following the Copyflo, the process was scaled down to produce the 1824 microfilm printer. At about half the size and weight, this still sizable machine printed onto hand-fed, cut-sheet paper which was pulled through the process by one of two gripper bars. A scaled-down version of this gripper feed system was to become the basis for the 813 desktop copier.

===Xerox 914===
{{main|Xerox 914}}
The company came to prominence in 1959 with the introduction of the Xerox 914,<ref>{{cite book|last=Wirten|first=Eva Hemmungs|title=No Trespassing: Authorship, Intellectual Property Rights, and the Boundaries of Globalization|publisher=University of Toronto Press|year=2004|page=61|isbn=9780802086082|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZYurhbUh_2gC&pg=PA61|access-date=May 18, 2016|archive-date=February 4, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170204193057/https://books.google.com/books?id=ZYurhbUh_2gC&pg=PA61&dq=|url-status=live}}</ref> "the most successful single product of all time." The 914, the first [[paper|plain paper]] [[photocopier]], was developed by Carlson and [[John H. Dessauer]];<ref>[http://americanhistory.si.edu/collections/object.cfm?key=35&objkey=191 Xerox 914 Plain Paper Copier] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110922224938/http://americanhistory.si.edu/collections/object.cfm?key=35&objkey=191 |date=September 22, 2011 }} at americanhistory.si.edu</ref> it was so popular that by the end of 1961 Xerox had almost $60 million in revenue. The product was sold by an innovative ad campaign showing that even monkeys could make copies at the touch of a button - simplicity would become the foundation of Xerox products and user interfaces. Revenues leaped to over $500 million by 1965.

=== Xeronic Computer Printer ===
In 1956, Haloid formed a joint venture in the UK with [[Rank_Xerox|Rank Organisation]] whose Rank Precision Industries Ltd. subsidiary was charged with anglicising the US products. Rank's Precision Industries went on to develop the Xeronic computer printer and Rank Data Systems Ltd was set up to bring the product to market. It used [[cathode ray tube]]s to generate the characters and forms could be overlaid from [[microfilm]] images. Initially, they planned for the [[Ferranti]] and AEI computer companies to sell the Xeronic as an on-line peripheral, but due to interface problems, Rank switched to a magnetic tape off-line technique. In 1962, Lyons Computers Ltd. placed an order for use with their [[LEO_(computer)|LEO III computer]], and the printer was delivered in 1964. It printed 2,888 lines per minute, slower than the target of 5,000 lpm.<ref>{{cite book |last=Bird|first=Peter |date=1994 |title=LEO The first business computer |publisher=Biddles Ltd.|pages=153–159|chapter=Chapter 5: Further Automation Improvements|isbn=0-9521651-0-4}}</ref>

}}</ref> and the company expanded substantially, making millionaires of some long-suffering investors who had nursed the company through the slow research and development phase of the product.

In 1960, a xerography research facility called the Wilson Center for Research and Technology was opened in [[Webster (town), New York|Webster, New York]]. In 1961, the company changed its name to Xerox Corporation.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/08/business/media/08adco.html|title=Xerox Hopes Its New Logo Doesn't Say 'Copier'|last=Deutsch|first=Claudia H.|date=2008-01-08|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-10-04|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331|archive-date=March 1, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180301092639/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/08/business/media/08adco.html|url-status=live}}</ref> Xerox common stock (XRX) was listed on the [[New York Stock Exchange]] in 1961<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.investors.com/news/management/leaders-and-success/copy-his-success-joe-wilson-concentrated-on-innovation-making-xerox-a-winner/|title=Copy His Success: Joe Wilson Zeroed In On Innovation At Xerox|last=Saito-Chung|first=David|date=18 April 2016|website=Investor's Business Daily|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160803210654/http://www.investors.com/news/management/leaders-and-success/copy-his-success-joe-wilson-concentrated-on-innovation-making-xerox-a-winner/|archive-date=August 3, 2016|access-date=}}</ref> and on the [[Chicago Stock Exchange]] in 1990.

In 1963, Xerox introduced the Xerox 813, the first desktop plain-paper copier, realizing Carlson's vision of a copier that could fit on anyone's office desk. Ten years later, in 1973, a basic, analogue, color copier, based on the 914, followed. The 914 itself was gradually sped up to become the 420 and 720. The 813 was similarly developed into the 330 and 660 products and, eventually, also the 740 desktop microfiche printer.

Xerox's first foray into duplicating, as distinct from copying, was with the Xerox 2400, introduced in 1966. The model number denoted the number of prints produced in an hour. Although not as fast as [[offset printing]], this machine introduced the industry's first automatic document feeder, paper slitter and perforator, and collator (sorter). This product was soon sped up by fifty percent to become the Xerox 3600 Duplicator.

Meanwhile, a small lab team was borrowing 914 copiers and modifying them. The lab was developing what it called long distance xerography (LDX) to connect two copiers using the public telephone network, so that a document scanned on one machine would print out on the other. The LDX system was introduced in 1964. Many years later, this work came to fruition in the Xerox telecopiers, seminal to today's [[fax machine]]s. The fax operation in today's multifunction copiers is true to Carlson's original vision for these devices.

In 1968, [[Charles Peter McColough|C.

Xerox embarked on a series of acquisitions. It purchased [[University Microfilms International]] in 1962, Electro-Optical Systems in 1963,<ref name=Gale /> and [[R. R. Bowker]] in 1967. In 1969, Xerox acquired [[Scientific Data Systems]] (SDS),<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1975/07/22/archives/computer-making-will-end-at-xerox-844million-writeoff-is-taken-in.html|title=Computer Making Willend Atxerox|last=Barmash|first=Isadore|date=1975-07-22|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-10-04|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331|archive-date=October 9, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201009163320/https://www.nytimes.com/1975/07/22/archives/computer-making-will-end-at-xerox-844million-writeoff-is-taken-in.html|url-status=live}}</ref> which it renamed the Xerox Data Systems (XDS) division and which produced the [[SDS Sigma series|Sigma]] line and its successor XDS 5xx series of [[mainframe computer]]s in the 1960s and 1970s.

In the mid-1970s, Xerox introduced the "Xerox 9200 Duplicating System". Originally designed to be sold to print shops to increase their productivity, it was twice a fast as the 3600 duplicator at two impressions per second (7200 per hour). It was followed by the 9400, which did auto-duplexing, and then by the 9500, which was which added variable zoom reduction and electronic lightness/darkness control.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

Following these years of record profits, in 1975, Xerox resolved an anti-trust suit with the United States [[Federal Trade Commission]] (FTC), which at the time was under the direction of [[Frederic M.

[[David T. Kearns]], a Xerox executive since 1971, took over as CEO in 1982. The company was revived in the 1980s and 1990s, through improvement in quality design and realignment of its product line. Attempting to expand beyond copiers, in 1981 Xerox introduced a line of electronic memory typewriters, the ''Memorywriter'', which gained 20% market share, mostly at the expense of IBM.<ref name=Gale />

In 1983, Xerox bought [[Crum & Forster]], an insurance company, and formed Xerox Financial Services (XFS) in 1984.<ref name=Gale>{{cite web|title=Gale Directory of Company Histories: Xerox Corporation (from Amswers.com)|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/xerox-1|accessdate=November 3, 2013|archive-date=October 31, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131031135454/http://www.answers.com/topic/xerox-1|url-status=live}}</ref>

In 1985, Xerox sold all of its publishing subsidiaries including University Microfilms and R. R. Bowker.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Winter|first1=Christine|title=Bell, Howell Acquires Two Data Firms|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1985-11-14/business/8503180622_1_umi-gerald-schultz-bekins-records-management|accessdate=Sep 10, 2014|work=Chicago Tribune|date=November 14, 1985|archive-date=September 11, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140911075117/http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1985-11-14/business/8503180622_1_umi-gerald-schultz-bekins-records-management|url-status=live}}</ref>

===1990s===
[[File:Xerox logo 1994.svg|thumb|90px|right|Xerox "Pixellated X" logo introduced in 1994]]
In 1990, [[Paul Allaire]], a Xerox executive since 1966, succeeded David Kearns, who had reached mandatory retirement age. Allaire disentangled Xerox from the financial services industry.

Development of digital photocopiers in the 1990s and a revamp of the entire product range again gave Xerox a technical lead over its competitors. In 1990, Xerox released the [[DocuTech]] Production Publisher Model 135, ushering in print-on-demand. Digital photocopiers were essentially high-end laser printers with integrated scanners. Soon, additional features such as network printing and faxing were added to many models, known as Multi Function Machines, or just MFMs, which were able to be attached to computer networks. Xerox worked to turn its product into a service, providing a complete document service to companies including supply, maintenance, configuration, and user support.

To reinforce this image, the company introduced a corporate signature in 1994, "The Document Company", above its main logo and introduced a red digital X. The digital X symbolized the transition of documents between the paper and digital worlds.

In April 1999, Allaire was succeeded by [[G. Richard Thoman|Richard Thoman]], who had been brought in from [[IBM]] in 1997 as president. The first "outsider" to head Xerox, Thoman resigned in 2000.

After Thoman's resignation, Allaire again resumed the position of CEO and served until the appointment of [[Anne M.

In 2000, Xerox acquired [[Tektronix]] color printing and imaging division in Wilsonville, Oregon, for US$925 million. This led to the current [[Xerox Phaser]] line of products as well as Xerox [[solid ink]] printing technology.

In September 2004, Xerox celebrated the 45th anniversary of the Xerox 914. More than 200,000 units were made around the world between 1959 and 1976, the year production of the 914 was stopped. Today, the 914 is part of [[American history]] as an artifact in the [[Smithsonian Institution]].

On May 21, 2009, it was announced that [[Ursula Burns]] would succeed Anne Mulcahy as CEO of Xerox. On July 1, 2009, Burns became the first [[African American]] woman to head a company the size of Xerox.

On September 28, 2009, Xerox announced the intended acquisition of [[Affiliated Computer Services]], a services and [[outsourcing]] company, for $6.4 Billion. The acquisition was completed in February 2010. Xerox said it paid 4.935 Xerox shares and $18.60 cash for each share of ACS, totaling $6.4 billion, or $63.11 a share for the company.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/innovationNews/idUSTRE58R1V120090928|title=Xerox to buy ACS to expand back office services|work=Reuters|date=September 28, 2009|access-date=July 3, 2017|archive-date=October 1, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091001160212/http://www.reuters.com/article/innovationNews/idUSTRE58R1V120090928|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Digital printing===
The laser printer was invented in 1969 by Xerox researcher [[Gary Starkweather]] by modifying a Xerox 7000 copier. Xerox management was afraid the product version of Starkweather's invention, which became the 9700, would negatively impact their copier business so the innovation sat in limbo until IBM launched the [[IBM 3800|3800]] laser printer in 1976.

The first commercial non-impact printer was the Xerox 1200, introduced in 1973,<ref>{{cite web|last=Vullo|first=Christina|title=Flashback Friday: The Xerox 1200 Computer Printing System|url=http://digitalprinting.blogs.xerox.com/2012/09/flashback-friday-the-xerox-1200-computer-printing-system/#.UnOevlPRe3Q|work=Xerox Blogs|accessdate=November 1, 2013|archive-date=November 5, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105014630/http://digitalprinting.blogs.xerox.com/2012/09/flashback-friday-the-xerox-1200-computer-printing-system/#.UnOevlPRe3Q|url-status=live}}</ref> based on the 3600 copier. It had an optical character generator designed by optical engineer Phil Chen.

In 1977, following IBM's laser printer introduction, the [[Xerox 9700]] was introduced. Laser printing eventually became a multibillion-dollar business for Xerox.

In the late 1970s, Xerox introduced the "Xerox 350 color slide system" This product allowed the customer to create digital word and graphic 35mm slides. Many of the concepts used in today's "Photo Shop" programs were pioneered with this technology.

In 1980, Xerox announced the 5700 laser printing system, a much smaller version of their 9700, but with revolutionary touch screen capabilities and multiple media input (word processing disks, IBM magcards, etc.) and printer 'finishing' options. This product was allegedly never intended to make the commercial markets due to its development cost, but rather to show the innovation of Xerox. It took off with many customers, but was soon replaced with its smaller and lower cost [[Xerox 2700|2700 Distributed Electronic Printer]] offering in 1982.<ref>http://simson.net/ref/Xerox/1987.Xerox.FactBook.odd.pdf|title=Xerox {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201009163322/https://simson.net/page/Main_Page |date=October 9, 2020 }} 1987 Fact Book</ref>

===Palo Alto Research Center===
{{main|Xerox PARC}}

[[File:Xerox Alto.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The [[Xerox Alto]] workstation was developed at Xerox PARC.]]
In 1970, under company president [[Charles Peter McColough|C. Peter McColough]], Xerox opened the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center, known as Xerox PARC. The facility developed many modern computing technologies such as the [[graphical user interface]] (GUI), [[Laser printer|laser printing]], [[WYSIWYG]] text editors and [[Ethernet]]. From these inventions, Xerox PARC created the [[Xerox Alto]] in 1973, a small minicomputer similar to a modern [[workstation]] or [[personal computer]]. This machine can be considered the first true Personal Computer, given its versatile combination of a cathode-ray-type screen, mouse-type pointing device, and a QWERTY-type alphanumeric keyboard. But the Alto was never commercially sold, as Xerox itself could not see the sales potential of it. It was, however, installed in Xerox's own offices, worldwide and those of the US Government and military, who could see the potential. Within these sites the individual workstations were connected together by Xerox's own unique LAN, The Ethernet. Data was sent around this system of heavy, yellow, low loss coaxial cable using the packet data system. In addition, PARC also developed one of the earliest [[internetworking]] protocol suites, the [[PARC Universal Packet]] (PUP).

In 1979, Steve Jobs made a deal with Xerox's venture capital division: He would let them invest $1 million in exchange for a look at the technology they were working on. Jobs and the others saw the commercial potential of the [[WIMP (computing)|WIMP]] (Window, Icon, Menu, and Pointing device) system and redirected development of the [[Apple Lisa]] to incorporate these technologies. Jobs is quoted as saying, "They just had no idea what they had." In 1980, Jobs invited several key PARC researchers to join his company so that they could fully develop and implement their ideas.

In 1981, Xerox released a system similar to the Alto, the [[Xerox Star]]. It was the first commercial system to incorporate technologies that have subsequently become commonplace in personal computers, such as a bitmapped display, window-based GUI, mouse, [[Ethernet]] networking, [[file server]]s, [[print server]]s and [[e-mail]]. The Xerox Star and its successor the [[Xerox Daybreak]], despite their technological breakthroughs, did not sell well due to its high price, costing $16,000 per unit. A typical Xerox Star-based office, complete with network and printers, would have cost $100,000.

In the mid-1980s, [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] considered buying Xerox; however, a deal was never reached.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/gilpress/2018/01/14/apple-xerox-ibm-and-fumbling-the-future/|title=Apple, Xerox, IBM And Fumbling The Future|last=Press|first=Gil|website=Forbes|language=en|access-date=2019-06-04|archive-date=June 4, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190604063644/https://www.forbes.com/sites/gilpress/2018/01/14/apple-xerox-ibm-and-fumbling-the-future/|url-status=live}}</ref>{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} Apple instead bought rights to the Alto GUI and adapted it into a more affordable personal computer, aimed towards the business and education markets. The [[Macintosh 128K|Apple Macintosh]] was released in 1984, and was the first personal computer to popularize the GUI and mouse among the public.

In 2002, PARC was spun off into an independent wholly owned subsidiary of Xerox.

The European company [[Rank Xerox]], later extended to Asia and Africa, has been fully owned by Xerox Corporation since 1997. The Rank Xerox name was discontinued following the buyout, and the Rank Xerox Research Centre was renamed to the Xerox Research Centre Europe.

==Accounting irregularities==
On May 31, 2001, Xerox Corporation announced that its auditors, KPMG LLP, had certified Xerox's financial statements for the three years ended December 31, 2000. And the financials included some restatements.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Xerox+2000+Financial+Statement+Audit+Complete%3B+'After+Rigorous...-a075156139 |title=Xerox 2000 Financial Statement Audit Complete; 'After Rigorous Reviews of Xerox's Accounting, No Fictitious Transactions Were Found and the Company's Liquidity is Not Impacted.' |access-date=September 9, 2013 |archive-date=October 12, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161012071807/https://www.thefreelibrary.com/Xerox+2000+Financial+Statement+Audit+Complete%3B+'After+Rigorous...-a075156139 |url-status=live }}</ref> On March 31, 2002, Xerox restated its financials which reflected the reallocation of equipment sales revenue of more than $2 billion.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.crn.com/news/channel-programs/18837711/xerox-agrees-to-pay-fine-to-sec-restate-results.htm |title=Xerox agrees to pay fine to SEC, restate results |access-date=September 9, 2013 |archive-date=November 12, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131112062605/http://www.crn.com/news/channel-programs/18837711/xerox-agrees-to-pay-fine-to-sec-restate-results.htm |url-status=live }}</ref> On April 11, 2002, the U.S. [[Securities and Exchange Commission]] filed a complaint against Xerox.<ref>{{cite web |title=SEC v.

At issue was when the revenue was recognized, not the validity of the revenue. Xerox's restatement only changed what year the revenue was recognized. On December 20, 2002, Xerox Corporation reported that it had discovered an error in the calculation of its non-cash interest expense related to a debt instrument and associated interest rate swap agreements, resulted in after-tax understatement of interest expense of approximately $5 million to $6 million or less than 1 cent per share in each of the four quarters of 2001 and for the first three quarters of 2002.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://whattheythink.com/news/17176-xerox-restates-reports-adjustment-non-cash-interest/ |title=Xerox Reports Adjustment in Non-Cash Interest Expense |access-date=September 9, 2013 |archive-date=November 12, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131112060345/http://whattheythink.com/news/17176-xerox-restates-reports-adjustment-non-cash-interest/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

In response to the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission|SEC's]] complaint, Xerox Corporation neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing. It agreed to pay a $10 million penalty and to restate its financial results for the years 1997 through 2000. On June 5, 2003, six Xerox senior executives accused of securities fraud settled their issues with the SEC and neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing. They agreed to pay $22 million in penalties, disgorgement, and interest. The company received approval to settle the securities lawsuit in 2008.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://english.pravda.ru/news/business/27-03-2008/104702-xerox_corp-0/ |title=Xerox Corp receives approval to settle securities lawsuit |date=Mar 2008 |accessdate=July 22, 2013 |archive-date=October 19, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141019072607/http://english.pravda.ru/news/business/27-03-2008/104702-xerox_corp-0/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

On January 29, 2003, the SEC filed a complaint against Xerox's auditors,<ref>{{cite web |title=Complaint: KPMG LLP et al. |work=SEC |year=2003 |url=https://www.sec.gov/litigation/complaints/comp18389.htm |access-date=September 18, 2017 |archive-date=January 18, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170118122636/https://www.sec.gov/litigation/complaints/comp18389.htm |url-status=live }}</ref> [[KPMG]], alleging four partners in the "Big Five" accounting firm permitted Xerox to "cook the books" to fill a $3 billion "gap" in revenue and $1.4 billion "gap" in pre-tax earnings.

During a settlement with the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]], Xerox began to revamp itself once more. As a symbol of this transformation, the relative size of the word "Xerox" was increased in proportion to "The Document Company" on the corporate signature, and the latter was dropped altogether in September 2004, along with the digital X. However, the digital X and "The Document Company" were still used by [[Fuji Xerox]] until April 2008.

==Character substitution bug==
In 2013, German computer scientist David Kriesel ([[:de:David Kriesel|de]]) discovered an [[Software bug|error]] in a Xerox WorkCentre 7535 copier. The device would substitute number digits in scanned documents, even when [[Optical character recognition|OCR]] was turned off. For instance, a cost table in a scanned document had an entry of 85.40, instead of the original sum of 65.40.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dkriesel.com/en/blog/2013/0802_xerox-workcentres_are_switching_written_numbers_when_scanning|title=Xerox scanners/photocopiers randomly alter numbers in scanned documents|publisher=|accessdate=March 22, 2015|archive-date=October 9, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201009163354/http://www.dkriesel.com/en/blog/2013/0802_xerox-workcentres_are_switching_written_numbers_when_scanning|url-status=live}}</ref> After unsuccessfully trying to resolve this issue with Xerox's customer support, he publicised his findings on his blog. Providing examples pages that lead to the bug occurrence, it was confirmed that this bug was reproducible on a wide variety of Xerox WorkCentre and other high-end Xerox copiers.

The source of the error was a bug in the [[JBIG2]] implementation, which is an image compression standard that makes use of pattern matching to encode identical characters only once. While this provides a high level of compression, it is susceptible to errors in identifying similar characters.

A possible workaround was published by Kriesel, which involved setting the image quality from "normal" to "higher" or "high". Shortly afterwards, it was found that the same fix had been suggested in the printer manual, which mentioned the occurrence of character substitutions in "normal mode", indicating that Xerox was aware of the software error.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dkriesel.com/en/blog/2013/0806_work_around_for_character_substitutions_in_xerox_machines|title=Possible workaround for character substitutions in xerox machines|publisher=|accessdate=March 22, 2015|archive-date=October 9, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201009163359/http://www.dkriesel.com/en/blog/2013/0806_work_around_for_character_substitutions_in_xerox_machines|url-status=live}}</ref> In Xerox's initial response to a growing interest by the media, the error was described as occurring rarely and only when factory settings had been changed.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/bw/articles/2013-08-09/some-xerox-scanners-can-alter-documents-by-accident|title=Some Xerox Scanners Can Alter Documents by Accident|first=Peter|last=Coy|work=Businessweek.com|accessdate=March 22, 2015|archive-date=February 10, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150210141525/http://www.bloomberg.com/bw/articles/2013-08-09/some-xerox-scanners-can-alter-documents-by-accident|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zdnet.com/article/xerox-scanners-alter-numbers-in-scanned-documents/|title=Xerox scanners alter numbers in scanned documents|work=ZDNet|accessdate=March 22, 2015|archive-date=February 7, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150207094044/http://www.zdnet.com/article/xerox-scanners-alter-numbers-in-scanned-documents/|url-status=live}}</ref> After Kriesel provided evidence that the error was also occurring in all three image quality modes (normal, higher and high) including the factory defaults, Xerox corrected their statement and released a software patch to eliminate the problem.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/2046579/impact-of-xerox-charactersubstitution-bug-wider-than-thought.html|title=Impact of Xerox character-substitution bug wider than thought|first=Martyn|last=Williams|date=August 13, 2013|work=PCWorld|accessdate=March 22, 2015|archive-date=February 7, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150207103444/http://www.pcworld.com/article/2046579/impact-of-xerox-charactersubstitution-bug-wider-than-thought.html|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-23610405|title=BBC News – Xerox to update scan software after switched number outcry|work=BBC News|accessdate=March 22, 2015|archive-date=November 19, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141119133408/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-23610405|url-status=live}}</ref> Despite the problem being present in some instances also in higher quality mode, Xerox advises users that they can use this mode as an alternative to applying the patch.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.xerox.com/assets/pdf/ScanningQAincludingAppendixA.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=February 8, 2015 |archive-date=November 29, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151129083738/http://www.xerox.com/assets/pdf/ScanningQAincludingAppendixA.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref>

==Trademark==
The word ''xerox'' is used as a synonym for ''photocopy'' (both as a noun and a [[verb]]) in many areas: for example, "I xeroxed the document and placed it on your desk" or "Please make a xeroxed copy of the articles and hand them out a week before the exam". Though both are common, the company does not condone such uses of its trademark, and is particularly concerned about the ongoing use of Xerox as a verb as this places the trademark in danger of being declared a [[genericized trademark|generic word]] by the courts. The company is engaged in an ongoing advertising and media campaign to convince the public that Xerox should not be used as a verb.<ref>{{cite book |title=Patent, Copyright & Trademark |last=Stim |first=Richard |year=2006 |publisher=Nolo |page=388 |isbn=1-4133-0196-7}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.xerox.com/go/xrx/template/019d.jsp?view=Factbook&id=Overview |title=Online Fact Book: Overview |accessdate=July 2, 2007 |archive-date=December 22, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081222051427/http://www.xerox.com/go/xrx/template/019d.jsp?view=Factbook&id=Overview |url-status=live }}</ref>

To this end, the company has written to publications that have used Xerox as a verb, and has also purchased print advertisements declaring that "you cannot 'xerox' a document, but you can copy it on a Xerox Brand copying machine". Xerox Corporation continues to protect its trademark in most if not all trademark categories.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} Despite their efforts, many dictionaries continue to include the use of "xerox" as a verb, including the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''. In 2012, the Intellectual Property Appellate Board (IPAB) of [[India]] declared "xerox" a non-generic term after "almost 50 years (1963–2009) of continued existence on the register without challenge, and with proof of almost 44 years of use evident (1965–2009)",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/appellate-board-upholds-trademark-status-of-xerox/article3927133.ece|title=Appellate Board upholds trademark status of Xerox|author=R.
