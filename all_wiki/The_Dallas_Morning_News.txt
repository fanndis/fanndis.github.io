==History==
[[File:DallasMorningNews-4043.jpg|thumb|250px|right|''The Dallas Morning News'' main printing plant and distribution center in [[Plano, Texas]].]]
''The Dallas Morning News'' was founded in 1885 as a spin-off of the ''[[Galveston Daily News]]'' by [[Alfred Horatio Belo]]. In 1926, the Belo family sold a majority interest in the paper to its longtime publisher, [[George Dealey]].

In 1904, ''The Dallas Morning News'' began publishing the ''[[Texas Almanac]]'', which had previously been published intermittently during the 1800s by the ''Galveston Daily News''.  After over a century of publishing by the ''Morning News'', the Almanac's assets were gifted to the [[Texas State Historical Association]] in May 2008.<ref>"[https://texasalmanac.com/about-us About us]", ''Texas Almanac'' ([[Texas State Historical Association]]).  Retrieved 2018-12-10.</ref>

By the late 1940s, the ''Morning News'' had built and opened a new office, newsroom, and printing plant at Houston and Young Streets on the southwest side of [[downtown Dallas]].  A notable part of the facade above the front doors includes a quote etched in the stony exterior:
::::::<blockquote>BUILD THE NEWS UPON<br>THE ROCK OF TRUTH<br>AND RIGHTEOUSNESS<br>CONDUCT IT ALWAYS<br>UPON THE LINES OF<br>FAIRNESS AND INTEGRITY<br>ACKNOWLEDGE THE RIGHT<br>OF THE PEOPLE TO GET<br>FROM THE NEWSPAPER<br>BOTH SIDES OF EVERY<br>IMPORTANT QUESTION<br>{{nb5}}{{nb5}}{{nb5}}{{nb5}}{{nb5}}<small>G. B. DEALEY</small></blockquote>
The complex at 508 Young Street would house all or part of the ''Morning News'' operations for the next six decades.

In late 1991, ''The Dallas Morning News'' became the lone major newspaper in the Dallas market when the ''[[Dallas Times Herald]]'' was closed after several years of circulation wars between the two papers, especially over the then-burgeoning classified advertising market. In July 1986, the ''Times Herald'' was purchased by [[William Dean Singleton]], owner of [[MediaNews Group]]. After 18 months of efforts to turn the paper around, Singleton sold it to an associate. On December 8, 1991, [[Belo]] bought the ''Times Herald'' for $55 million, closing the paper the next day.

It was not the first time the Belo family had bought (and closed) a paper named ''[[Dallas Herald|The Herald]]'' in Dallas.{{quote|[In]...1879 Alfred H. Belo was investigating the possibility of establishing a sister paper in rapidly developing North Texas. When Belo's efforts to purchase the ''Herald'' [an extant paper in Dallas] failed, he sent [[George Bannerman Dealey]] to launch a new paper, the ''Morning News'', which began publication on October 1, 1885. From the outset the ''Morning News'' enjoyed the double advantage of strong financial support and an accumulation of journalistic experience, and within a month and a half had absorbed its older rival.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fbe44|title=BELO, ALFRED HORATIO|work=tshaonline.org}}</ref><ref>[https://tshaonline.org/day-by-day/30294 "Dallas ''Morning News'' buys out rival paper", Texas Day by Day, 3 Dec 1885]</ref>}}

[[File:Aldianewspaperlogo.png|thumb|left|90px|''Al Día'' logo]]In 2003, a Spanish-language newspaper was launched by ''The Dallas Morning News'', called ''[[Al Día (Dallas)|Al Día]]''.  Initially ''Al Día'' came with a purchase price, but in recent years the newspaper has been made available free of charge.  It is published twice a week, on Wednesday and Saturday.<ref>"[http://www.aldiadallas.com/periodico-al-dia/ Sobre nosotros/About us]", Aldiadallas.com.  Retrieved 2018-12-09.</ref>

Between 2003 and 2011, a [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]]-sized publication called ''[[Quick (newspaper)|Quick]]'' was published by ''The Dallas Morning News'', which initially focused on general news in a quick-read, digest form, but in later years covered mostly entertainment and lifestyle stories.

In late 2013, ''The Dallas Morning News'' ended its longtime newsgathering collaboration with previously-co-owned TV station [[WFAA]].  The newspaper entered into a new partnership with [[KXAS-TV|KXAS]] at that time.<ref>{{cite news|title=The Dallas Morning News and Channel 5 form partnership|url=http://www.dallasnews.com/business/headlines/20131219-the-dallas-morning-news-and-channel-5-form-partnership.ece|author=Sheryl Jean|newspaper=The Dallas Morning News|date=December 19, 2013|access-date=December 10, 2018}}</ref>

[[File:Dallas Morning News vending machine 2019.jpg|thumb|125px|right|Newspaper vending machine with copies of ''The Dallas Morning News'', in front of a restaurant in northeast Dallas, 2019.]]Historically, the ''Morning News'' has tilted conservative, mirroring Texas′ drift to the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] since the 1950s.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.dallasnews.com/opinion/editorials/20160728-editorial-after-stormy-but-successful-democratic-convention-it-s-hillary-s-party-now.ece|title=After stormy but successful Democratic convention, it's Hillary's party now|newspaper=The Dallas Morning News|date=2016-07-29}}</ref>  However, on September 7, 2016 it endorsed [[Hillary Clinton]] for president, the first time it had endorsed a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] for president since [[Franklin D.

In late 2016 it was announced that ''The Dallas Morning News'' would move away from its home of 68 years on Young Street, to a [[Old Dallas Central Library|building]] on Commerce Street previously used by the Dallas Public Library for its downtown branch.  The Commerce Street address is one-third the size of the Young Street complex.  Reasons given for the move included technology innovations, fewer staff, as well as printing presses no longer co-located with the newsroom and main offices (printing is done now mainly at a facility in [[Plano, Texas|Plano]], north of Dallas).<ref>Jeffrey Weiss, "[https://www.dallasnews.com/business/real-estate/2016/10/06/dallas-morning-news-plans-crosstown-moveto-historic-statler-library-redevelopment Dallas Morning News plans crosstown move to historic Statler Library redevelopment]", ''The Dallas Morning News'', October 6, 2016.

Changes were announced in January 2019 which included staff layoffs (including editorial, arts/culture, and business) and reducing the paper's Business section to one separate section per week, on Sunday; the remainder of the week, Business coverage would be found in the paper's Metro section.  A total of 43 employees were affected by the move.<ref>Shawn Shinneman, "[https://www.dmagazine.com/frontburner/2019/01/dmn-announces-layoffs-including-several-in-editorial/ ''DMN'' Announces 43 Layoffs, Nearly Half in Editorial]", ''[[D Magazine]]'', January 7, 2019.

In late February 2019, several printing agreements were not renewed at the ''Morning News'' suburban printing plant, and 92 positions were affected by the change there.
