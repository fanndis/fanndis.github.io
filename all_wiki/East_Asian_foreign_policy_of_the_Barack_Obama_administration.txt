President [[Foreign policy of the Barack Obama administration|Barack Obama]]'s '''East Asia Strategy''' (2009–2017) represented a significant shift in the foreign policy of the United States. It took the country's focus from the Middle Eastern/European sphere and began to invest heavily in East Asian countries, some of which are in close proximity to the [[People's Republic of China]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2016/04/the-obama-doctrine/471525/|title=The Obama Doctrine|first=Jeffrey|last=Goldberg|publisher=|accessdate=26 August 2016}}</ref>

Additional focus was placed on the region with the Obama administration's 2012 "Pivot to East Asia" regional strategy,<ref name=Brookings>{{cite news|last=Bush III|first=Richard|title=The Response of China's Neighbors to the U.S. "Pivot" to Asia|url=http://www.brookings.edu/research/speeches/2012/01/31-us-pivot-bush|newspaper=Brookings Institution |date=31 January 2012}}</ref> whose key areas of actions are: "strengthening bilateral security alliances; deepening our working relationships with emerging powers, including with China; engaging with regional multilateral institutions; expanding trade and investment; forging a broad-based military presence; and advancing democracy and human rights."<ref>{{cite news |last=Clinton |first=Hillary Rodham |title=America's Pacific Century |url=http://iipdigital.usembassy.gov/st/english/article/2011/10/20111011161233su0.8861287.html#axzz30Ph1DmRw |newspaper=U.S. Department of State through Foreign Policy Magazine |date=11 October 2011}}</ref> A report by the [[Brookings Institution]] states that reactions to the pivot strategy were mixed, as "different Asian states responded to American rebalancing in different ways."<ref name=Brookings/>

There has been strong perception from China that all of these are part of US' [[China containment policy]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Denyer|first=Simon|title=Obama's Asia rebalancing turns into a big foreign policy heachache|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/28/obama-china-japan-relations-asia|newspaper=The Guardian through Washington Post |date=28 January 2014}}</ref> Proponents of this theory claim that the United States needs a weak, divided China to continue its hegemony in Asia. This is accomplished, the theory claims, by the United States establishing military, economic, and diplomatic ties with countries adjacent to China's borders.

Previously, under the administrations of [[Presidency of Bill Clinton|Bill Clinton]] and [[Presidency of George W. Bush|George W. Bush]], naval and air weapons systems were deployed to [[Guam]] and Japan, and cooperation began with [[Singapore]] by constructing an aircraft carrier facility at [[Changi Naval Base]].<ref name="Ross Pivot" /> "The Bush administration assigned an additional aircraft carrier to the Pacific theater and the Pentagon announced in 2005 that it would deploy 60 percent of U.S. submarines to Asia."<ref name="Ross Pivot" /> Spending for [[United States Pacific Command]] (PACOM) remained high during the anti-insurgency campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan.

Though other areas of the world remained important to American foreign policy, Obama pursued a "pivot" to [[East Asia]], focusing the U.S.'s diplomacy and trade in the region.<ref name="FP Pacific Century"/><ref name=bbcpivot>{{cite news|title=Barack Obama says Asia-Pacific is 'top US priority'|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-15715446|accessdate=November 14, 2015|publisher=BBC|date=November 17, 2011}}</ref> China's continued [[China as an emerging superpower|emergence]] as a [[Great power|major power]] was a major issue of Obama's presidency; while the two countries worked together on issues such as climate change, the [[China–United States relations|China-United States relationship]] also experienced tensions regarding [[Territorial disputes in the South China Sea|territorial claims]] in the [[South China Sea]] and the [[East China Sea]].<ref name="nakamurascs">{{cite news|last1=Nakamura|first1=David|title=China testing Obama as it expands its influence in Southeast Asia|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/china-testing-obama-as-it-expands-its-influence-in-southeast-asia/2016/03/01/d60e1248-dbdf-11e5-891a-4ed04f4213e8_story.html|accessdate=April 25, 2016|work=The Washington Post|date=March 1, 2016}}</ref> In 2016, the United States hosted a summit with the [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations]] (ASEAN) for the first time, reflecting the Obama administration's pursuit of closer relations with ASEAN and other Asian countries.<ref name="jmakinen">{{cite news|last1=Makinen|first1=Julie|title=Obama hosts ASEAN summit, a first in the U.S.|url=https://www.latimes.com/world/asia/la-fg-asean-summit-qa-20160215-story.html|accessdate=September 12, 2016|work=LA Times|date=February 15, 2016}}</ref> After helping to encourage openly contested [[2015 Myanmar general election|elections]] in [[Myanmar]], Obama lifted many US sanctions on Myanmar.<ref name=agowen>{{cite news|last1=Gowen|first1=Annie|title=Burma victory caps a decades-long battle for opposition leader Suu Kyi|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/burmas-opposition-party-clinches-landslide-election-victory/2015/11/13/c1ff23c6-8984-11e5-bd91-d385b244482f_story.html|accessdate=November 15, 2015|work=The Washington Post|date=November 13, 2015}}</ref><ref name="davismyanmar">{{cite news|last1=Hirschfield Davis|first1=Julie|title=Obama Pledges to Lift All Sanctions Against Myanmar|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/15/world/asia/myanmar-obama.html|accessdate=September 15, 2016|work=The New York Times|date=September 14, 2016}}</ref> Obama also increased US military ties with [[Vietnam]],<ref name="ap1">{{cite news|last1=Ap|first1=Tiffany|last2=Rizzo|first2=Jennifer|last3=Liptak|first3=Kevin|title=Obama lifts U.S. arms ban on Vietnam|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/05/23/politics/obama-vietnam-trip/|accessdate=August 2, 2016|publisher=CNN|date=May 23, 2016}}</ref> [[Australia]], and the [[Philippines]], increased aid to [[Laos]], and contributed to a warming of relations between [[South Korea]] and [[Japan]].<ref name="nakamura9816">{{cite news|last1=Nakamura|first1=David|title=An incomplete victory lap for Obama on his final presidential trip to Asia|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/no-victory-lap-for-obama-on-his-final-presidential-trip-to-asia/2016/09/08/fb9a56ce-75d2-11e6-b786-19d0cb1ed06c_story.html|accessdate=September 9, 2016|work=The Washington Post|date=September 8, 2016}}</ref> Obama designed the [[Trans-Pacific Partnership]] as the key economic pillar of the Asian pivot, though the agreement remains unratified.<ref name="nakamura9816"/> Obama made little progress with [[North Korea–United States relations|relations]] with [[North Korea]], a long-time adversary of the United States, and North Korea continued to develop its [[North Korea and weapons of mass destruction|WMD program]].<ref name="NK9916">{{cite news|last1=Hang-Sun|first1=Choe|last2=Perlez|first2=Jane|title=North Korea Tests a Nuclear Device, South Says|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/09/world/asia/north-korea-nuclear-test.html|accessdate=September 9, 2016|work=The New York Times|date=September 8, 2016}}</ref>

Also known as "Pivot to Asia", the American military and diplomatic "pivot", or "rebalance", toward Asia became a popular buzzword after [[Hillary Clinton]] authored ''America's Pacific Century,'' in ''[[Foreign Policy]]''.<ref name="FP Pacific Century">{{cite news|last=Clinton|first=Hillary|title=America's Pacific Century|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/articles/2011/10/11/americas_pacific_century|accessdate=7 June 2013|newspaper=Foreign Policy|date=November 2011}}</ref> [[Hillary Clinton|Clinton's]] article emphasizes the importance of the Asia-Pacific, noting that nearly half of the world's population resides there, making its development vital to American economic and strategic interests. She states that "open markets in Asia provide the United States with unprecedented opportunities for investment, trade, and access to cutting-edge technology. Our economic recovery at home will depend on exports and the ability of American firms to tap into the vast and growing consumer base of Asia. Strategically, maintaining peace and security across the Asia-Pacific is increasingly crucial to global progress, whether through defending [[freedom of navigation]] in the [[South China Sea]], countering the [[nuclear proliferation]] efforts of North Korea, or ensuring transparency in the military activities of the region's key players."<ref name="FP Pacific Century" /> The "pivot" strategy, according to Clinton, will proceed along six courses of action: strengthening bilateral security alliances; deepening America's relationships with rising powers, including China; engaging with regional multilateral institutions; expanding trade and investment; forging a broad-based military presence; and advancing democracy and human rights.<ref name="FP Pacific Century"/>

[[Kevin Rudd]], the Prime Minister of Australia at the time, believed that Obama's "pivot" or rebalancing toward the Asia-Pacific region was appropriate: "without such a move, there was a danger that China, with its hard-line, realist view of international relations, would conclude that an economically exhausted United States was losing its staying power in the Pacific."<ref name="Rudd FA">{{cite journal|last=Rudd|first=Kevin|title=Beyond the Pivot: A New Road Map for U.S.-Chinese Relations|journal=Foreign Affairs|date=March–April 2013|volume=92|issue=2|pages=9–15|url=http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/138843/kevin-rudd/beyond-the-pivot|accessdate=4 April 2013}}</ref> With the United States now fully invested in Asia, Rudd wrote that Washington and Beijing must create long-term cooperative strategies that accommodate each other's interests. Doing this would significantly reduce miscalculation and the likelihood of conflict. Rudd maintained that the United States' rebalancing is not purely a military one but rather "part of a broader regional diplomatic and economic strategy that also includes the decision to become a member of the East Asia Summit and plans to develop the Trans-Pacific Partnership, deepen the United States' strategic partnership with India, and open the door to Myanmar."<ref name="Rudd FA"/> Beijing may not welcome the pivot, but Rudd believed China, whose military academies read [[Clausewitz]] and [[Hans Morgenthau|Morgenthau]] and respect strategic strength, understands it.

Robert S. Ross, an Associate at the John King Fairbank Center for Chinese Studies at [[Harvard University]], argues that the "pivot" toward China is creating a self-fulfilling prophecy, whereby U.S. policy "unnecessarily compounds Beijing's insecurities and will only feed China's aggressiveness, undermine regional stability, and decrease the possibility of cooperation between Beijing and Washington."<ref name="Ross Pivot">{{cite journal|last=Ross|first=Robert|title=The Problem with the Pivot: Obama's New Asia Policy Is Unnecessary and Counterproductive|journal=Foreign Affairs|date=November–December 2012|volume=91|issue=6|pages=70–82}}</ref> The United States is minimizing long-term diplomatic engagement and inflating the threat posed by Chinese power when it should really be recognizing China's inherent weaknesses and its own strengths. "The right China policies would assuage, not exploit, Beijing's anxieties, while protecting U.S. interests in the region."<ref name="Ross Pivot"/>

[[Amitai Etzioni]], professor of international affairs at the [[George Washington University]], argues that the pivot to Asia is premature. Though assessments of China's military vary, even the most hawkish foreign policy experts state that it will be decades before China's [[People's Liberation Army]] will threaten the superpower status of the U.S. Meanwhile, turning away from the Middle East, where a number of urgent challenges remain, including the [[Syrian civil war|Syrian Civil War]], the ongoing struggle with the [[Taliban]] and [[al Qaeda|al-Qaeda]], and [[Iran]]'s nuclear program, would undermine the interests of the United States and its allies in the region and needlessly antagonize China.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Etzioni|first=Amitai|title=No Pivot to Asia|journal=The Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary Diplomatist |date=March 2013 |volume=1|issue=1}}</ref>

Aaron L. Friedberg, professor of politics and international affairs at the [[Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs]] at [[Princeton University]], believes U.S. strategy toward China has coupled engagement with balancing. "The engagement half of this strategy has been geared toward enmeshing China in global trade and international institutions, discouraging it from challenging the status quo, and giving it incentives to become what the George W. Bush administration termed a 'responsible stakeholder' in the existing international system."<ref name="Friedberg Bucking">{{cite journal|last=Friedberg|first=Aaron|title=Bucking Beijing: An Alternative U.S. China Policy|journal=Foreign Affairs |date=September–October 2012 |volume=91|issue=5|pages=48–58|url=http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/138032/aaron-l-friedberg/bucking-beijing|accessdate=31 October 2012}}</ref> The other half attempts to maintain the balance of power, deter aggression, and mitigate any attempts of coercion. Friedberg believes more emphasis has been placed on the former and not the latter. "The problem with the pivot is that to date it lacks serious substance. The actions it has entailed either have been merely symbolic, such as the pending deployment of a small number of U.S. marines to Australia, or have involved simply the reallocation of existing air and naval assets from other theaters."<ref name="Friedberg Bucking" />

The PRC's Defense Ministry has cited the pivot as an excuse for their own continued buildup.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.stripes.com/news/special-reports/crisis-in-korea/china-criticizes-increase-in-us-forces-in-asia-1.216769 |title=China criticizes increase in US forces in Asia |last1=BODEEN |first1=CHRISTOPHER |date=16 April 2013 |work=Stars and Stripes |publisher=AP |accessdate=16 April 2013 }}{{Dead link|date=May 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> China has also cited the American example for other actions, such as the establishment of their [[Air Defense Identification Zone (East China Sea)|Air Defense Identification Zone]].

Knopf. 2012), p 65.</ref>}}

On 4 June 2013, the Asia-Pacific Strategy Working Group at the [[American Enterprise Institute]] (AEI) released ''Securing U.S. Interests and Values in the Asia-Pacific'', a memorandum to President [[Barack Obama]] and the [[United States Congress]].<ref name="AEI Asia Strategy Group">{{cite web|author1=Dan Blumenthal |author2=Ellen Bork |author3=Jacqueline Newmyer Deal |author4=Christopher J.

Prem Mahadevan, senior researcher at the [[Center for Security Studies (CSS)]] at [[ETH Zurich]], argues that two complementing circumstances in the Asia-Pacific have precipitated the pivot: "The security dynamic in East Asia is two layered; one layer consists of regional actors pursuing their own agendas, while the second consists of global influences which are propelling China into a geopolitical contest against the United States. On a grand strategic level, both sets of dynamics feed into one another."<ref>{{cite book|last=Mahadevan|first=Prem|title=Strategic Trends 2013: Key Developments in Global Affairs|year=2013|publisher=ETH Zurich|location=Zurich, Switzerland|isbn=978-3-905696-40-0|page=38|url=http://www.css.ethz.ch/publications/pdfs/Strategic-Trends-2013-EastAsia.pdf}}</ref> Consequently, newly commissioned ships and [[Fifth-generation jet fighter|fifth generation aircraft]] are being prioritized for the Pacific theater of U.S. military operations to maintain the balance of power. "It is expected that when the 'rebalancing' or 'pivot' of forces from the Atlantic to the Pacific is complete, 60 percent of the U.S. Navy will be based in the Pacific – a 10 percent increase from current levels. In effect, the theater would gain one additional U.S. aircraft carrier, seven destroyers, ten [[littoral combat ship]]s and two submarines, plus reconnaissance assets such as [[Lockheed EP-3|EP3]] spy planes."<ref>{{cite book|last=Mahadevan|first=Prem|title=Strategic Trends 2013: Key Developments in Global Affairs|year=2013|publisher=ETH Zurich|location=Zurich, Switzerland|isbn=978-3-905696-40-0|page=51|url=http://www.css.ethz.ch/publications/pdfs/Strategic-Trends-2013-EastAsia.pdf}}</ref>

Think-tanks such as the [[World Pensions & Investments Forum|World Pensions Council (WPC)]] have argued that the establishment of the [[Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank]] constitutes to a large extent an economic response to a geopolitical "encirclement strategy" aimed at containing China: "To contain China, the US sought new defence and trade alliances across Asia from Baku to Borneo, with limited success. Despite Washington's insistent nudging, Tokyo and Seoul have been reluctant to strengthen their bilateral military and economic ties. But as the 'liberal hawks' of Washington DC rather clumsily deployed this encirclement strategy, the Chinese leadership did not stay idle.

== Vietnam ==
The United States has increased its military presence in Indochina. In the 1990s, Washington rebuffed Vietnam's requests for more defense ties. This changed in 2010 when Secretary of State [[Hillary Clinton]], for the first time since the Vietnam War, called for an American–Vietnamese strategic partnership. "Since then, the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] has held annual exercises with the [[Vietnam People's Navy|Vietnamese navy]], and in 2011, the two countries signed a memorandum of understanding on defense cooperation."<ref name="Ross Pivot" />

The Obama Administration has attempted to capitalize on the much evolved relations between the United States and Vietnam since the end of the [[Vietnam War]]. The formal normalization of relations occurred in 1995, subsequently expanding under both the Clinton and Bush Administrations with dialogues and agreements on human rights, civil aviation, and free trade. In August 2010, the [[U.S. Department of Defense]] and Vietnam's Ministry of Defense held the first round of high-level defense talks, known as the Defense Policy Dialogue.<ref>[https://2009-2017.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/4130.htm State Department Background Vietnam]. Retrieved 17 July 2012.</ref> Secretary of State has visited the country three times during her tenure, discussing such topics as regional integration, North Korea, Burma, cyber security and maritime rights in the South China Sea.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20120711173249/http://www.state.gov/secretary/rm/2012/07/194766.htm Remarks with Foreign Minister Pham Binh Ming After July 2012 Meeting with Secretary Clinton].
