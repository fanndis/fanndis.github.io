'''Her Majesty's Attorney General for England and Wales''', usually known simply as the '''Attorney General (A-G)''', is one of the [[Law Officers of the Crown]]. The Attorney General serves as the chief legal adviser to the Crown and the Government in [[England and Wales]], and though they maintain [[Attorney General's Office (United Kingdom)|their own office]], they are still subordinate to the [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|Cabinet-level]] [[Secretary of State for Justice]] ([[Lord Chancellor]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1731&context=dlj|title=The Attorney General of England and the Attorney General of the United States|publisher=Duke University School of Law|format=PDF|access-date=5 December 2018}}</ref> The [[Solicitor General for England and Wales]] serves as the next in command and is subordinate to the Attorney General.

The position of Attorney General has existed since at least 1243, when records show a professional attorney was hired to represent the King's interests in court. The position first took on a political role in 1461 when the holder of the office was summoned to the [[House of Lords]] to advise the government there on legal matters. In 1673 the Attorney General officially became the Crown's adviser and representative in legal matters, although still specialising in litigation rather than advice. The beginning of the twentieth century saw a shift away from litigation and more towards legal advice.  Today prosecutions are carried out by the [[Crown Prosecution Service]] and most legal advice to government departments is provided by the Government Legal Service, both under the supervision of the Attorney General.

The job of the Attorney General is a demanding one, and [[Patrick Hastings|Sir Patrick Hastings]] wrote while serving that "to be a law officer is to be in hell".<ref name=jones43/> Duties include superintending the [[Crown Prosecution Service]], the [[Serious Fraud Office (United Kingdom)|Serious Fraud Office]], and other government lawyers with the authority to prosecute cases.  Additionally, the Attorney General superintends the [[Government Legal Department]] (formerly the Treasury Solicitor's Department), [[HM Crown Prosecution Service Inspectorate]] and the Service Prosecuting Authority. The Attorney advises the government, individual government departments and individual government ministers on legal matters, answering questions in Parliament and bringing "unduly lenient" sentences and points of law to the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales]]. Since the passing of the [[Law Officers Act 1997]] duties can be delegated to the Solicitor General, and any actions are treated as if they came from the Attorney General.

==History==
The origins of the office are unknown, but the earliest record of an "attorney of the crown" is from 1243, when a professional attorney named Laurence Del Brok was paid to prosecute cases for the King, who could not appear in courts where he had an interest.<ref name=jones43>Jones (1969) p.43</ref> During the early days of the office the holder was largely concerned with representing the Crown in litigation, and held no political role or duties.<ref name=jones45>Jones (1969) p.45</ref> Although a valuable position, the Attorney General was expected to work incredibly hard; although [[Francis North, 1st Baron Guilford|Francis North]] (1637–1685) was earning £7,000 a year as Attorney General he was pleased to give up the office and become [[Chief Justice of the Common Pleas]] because of the smaller workload, despite the heavily reduced pay.<ref name=jones45/> The office first took on a political element in 1461, when the holder was summoned by writ to the [[House of Lords]] to advise the government on legal matters. This was also the first time that the office was referred to as the office of the "Attorney General".<ref name=jones43/> The custom of summoning the Attorney General to the Lords by writ when appointed continues unbroken to this day, although until the appointment of [[Lord Williams of Mostyn]] in 1999, no Attorney General had sat in the Lords since 1700, and no Attorney General had obeyed the writ since 1742.<ref name=jones44>Jones (1969) p.44</ref>

During the sixteenth century the Attorney General was used to pass messages between the [[House of Lords]] and House of Commons, although he was viewed suspiciously by the Commons and seen as a tool of the Lords and the King.<ref name=jones44/> In 1673 the Attorney General began to take up a seat in the House of Commons, and since then it has been convention to ensure that all Attorneys General are members of the House of Commons or House of Lords, although there is no requirement that they be so.<ref>Cooley (1958) p.307</ref> During the constitutional struggle centred on the [[Royal Declaration of Indulgence]] in 1672 and 1673 the Attorney General officially became the Crown's representative in legal matters.

In 1890 the ability of an Attorney General to continue practising privately was formally taken away, turning the office-holder into a dedicated representative of the government.<ref>Attorney General's Office (2007) p.4</ref> Since the beginning of the twentieth century the role of the Attorney General has moved away from representing the Crown and government directly in court, and it has become more of a political and ministerial post, with the Attorney General serving as a legal adviser to both the government as a whole and individual government departments.<ref name=jones46>Jones (1969) p.46</ref> Despite this change, until the passing of the [[Homicide Act 1957]] the Attorney General was bound to prosecute any and all poisoning cases.<ref name=jones48/>

However, in recent times the Attorney General has exceptionally conducted litigation in person before the courts, for instance before the House of Lords in ''[[A and Others v Secretary of State for the Home Department]]'',<ref>[2004] UKHL 56</ref> where the legality of the Government's detention of terrorist suspects at Belmarsh was at issue.

==Role and duties==
The Attorney General is a non-cabinet minister who leads the [[Attorney General's Office (United Kingdom)|Attorney General's Office]]. The rule that no Attorney General may be a cabinet minister is a [[Constitutional convention (political custom)|political convention]] rather than a law, and for a short time the Attorney General did sit in cabinet,<ref name=jones47>Jones (1969) p.47</ref> starting with [[F. E. Smith, 1st Earl of Birkenhead|Lord Birkenhead]] in 1915 and ending with [[Douglas Hogg, 1st Viscount Hailsham|Douglas Hogg]] in 1928.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://oxforddnb.com/view/article/33925|title=Oxford DNB article: Hogg, Douglas McGarel (subscription needed)|year=2004|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|accessdate=29 August 2009}}</ref> There is nothing that prohibits Attorneys General from attending meetings of the cabinet, and on occasion they have been asked to attend meetings to advise the government on the best course of action legally;<ref name=jones47/> this has occurred on several occasions, most notably, Geoffrey Cox throughout the [[Brexit negotiations]]. Despite this it is considered preferable to exclude Attorneys General from cabinet meetings so as to draw a distinct line between them and the political decisions on which they are giving legal advice.<ref name=jones47/> As a government minister, the Attorney General is directly answerable to Parliament.<ref name="jones49">Jones (1969) p.49</ref>

The Attorney General is also the chief legal adviser of the Crown and its government, and has the primary role of advising the government on any legal repercussions of their actions, either orally at meetings or in writing. As well as the government as a whole, they also advise individual departments.<ref name=jones47/><ref name="What does the Attorney General Do">{{Cite web |url=http://l2b.thelawyer.com/barrister/the-attorney-general-who-what-why/3009891.article |title=What does the Attorney General Do? |access-date=10 March 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208043610/http://l2b.thelawyer.com/barrister/the-attorney-general-who-what-why/3009891.article |archive-date=8 December 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Although the primary role is no longer one of litigation, the Attorney General still represents the Crown and government in court in some select, particularly important cases, and chooses the [[Treasury Counsel]] who handle most government legal cases.<ref name=jones48>Jones (1969) p.48</ref> By convention, they represent the government in every case in front of the [[International Court of Justice]].<ref name=jones48/> The Attorney General also superintends the [[Crown Prosecution Service]] and appoints its head, the [[Director of Public Prosecutions]].
