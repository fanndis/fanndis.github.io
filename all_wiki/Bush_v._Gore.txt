'''''Bush v. Gore''''', 531 U.S. 98 (2000), was a decision of the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] on December 12, 2000, that settled a recount dispute in [[2000 United States presidential election in Florida|Florida's 2000 presidential election]] between [[George W. Bush]] and [[Al Gore]]. 

On December 8, the [[Florida Supreme Court]] had ordered a statewide recount of all [[undervote]]s, over 61,000 ballots that the vote tabulation machines had missed. The Bush campaign immediately asked the U.S. Supreme Court to stay the decision and halt the recount. Justice [[Antonin Scalia]], convinced that all the manual recounts being performed in Florida's counties were illegitimate, urged his colleagues to grant the stay immediately.<ref name="Vanity">{{cite magazine|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2004/10/florida-election-2000|title=The Path to Florida|work=Vanity Fair|first=David|last=Margolick|date=October 2004|publisher=Condé Nast}}</ref> On December 9, the five conservative justices on the Court granted the stay for Bush, with Scalia citing "irreparable harm" that could befall Bush, as the recounts would cast "a needless and unjustified cloud" over Bush's legitimacy. In dissent, Justice [[John Paul Stevens]] wrote that "counting every legally cast vote cannot constitute irreparable harm."<ref name="Vanity"/>  Oral arguments were scheduled for December 11.

In a [[Per curiam decision|''per curiam'' decision]], the Court first ruled 7–2 (Justices Stevens and [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]] dissenting), strictly on equal protection grounds, that the recount be stopped. Specifically, the use of different standards of counting in different counties violated the [[Equal Protection Clause]] of the [[Constitution of the United States|U.S. Constitution]]. (The case had also been argued on the basis of [[Article Two of the United States Constitution#Clause 2: Method of choosing electors|Article II]] jurisdictional grounds, which found favor with only Justices Scalia, [[Clarence Thomas]], and [[William Rehnquist]].) Second, the Court ruled 5–4 against the remedy, proposed by Justices [[Stephen Breyer]] and [[David Souter]], of sending the case back to Florida to complete the recount using a uniform statewide standard before the scheduled December 18 meeting of Florida's electors in [[Tallahassee, Florida|Tallahassee]].<ref name="Vanity"/> The majority held that no alternative method could be established within the discretionary December 12 “safe harbor” deadline set by [[Title 3 of the United States Code]] (3 U.S.C.), [[s:United States Code/Title 3/Chapter 1#§ 5. Determination of controversy as to appointment of electors|{{nowrap|§ 5}}]], which the Florida Supreme Court had stated that the Florida Legislature intended to meet.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/00-949.htm|title=Search - Supreme Court of the United States|website=www.supremecourt.gov}}</ref> That deadline arrived two hours after the release of the Court's decision. The Court, stating that not meeting the "safe harbor" deadline would therefore violate the Florida Election Code, rejected an extension of the deadline.

The Supreme Court decision allowed the previous vote certification made by [[Secretary of State of Florida|Florida Secretary of State]] [[Katherine Harris]] to stand for George W. Bush, who thereby won Florida's 25 [[United States Electoral College|electoral votes]]. Florida's votes gave Bush, the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] candidate, 271 electoral votes, one more than the 270 required to win the Electoral College. This meant the defeat of [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] candidate Al Gore, who won 267 electoral votes (but actually received only 266, as a "[[faithless elector]]" from the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]] abstained from voting).

Media organizations<ref name="FBP"/><ref name="battle"/><ref name="NORCc"/> later analyzed the ballots and found that, under any considered criteria, the originally pursued, limited county-based recounts would have confirmed a Bush victory, whereas a state-wide recount would have revealed a Gore victory. Florida later changed to new [[Voting machine|voting machines]] to avoid punch cards, which had produced dimpled or hanging [[Chad (paper)|chad]]s.

==Background==
{{see also| United States Electoral College |2000 United States presidential election}}
In the United States, each state conducts its own [[United States presidential election|popular vote election]] for president and vice president. The voters are actually voting for a slate of electors, each of whom pledges to vote for a particular candidate for each office, in the Electoral College. [[Article Two of the United States Constitution#Clause 2: Method of choosing electors|Article II, § 1, cl. 2]] of the U.S. Constitution provides that each state legislature decides how electors are chosen. Early in U.S. history, most state legislatures [[Electoral College (United States)#Appointment by state legislature|directly appointed]] the slate of electors for each of their respective states.

Today, state legislatures have enacted laws to provide for the selection of electors by popular vote within each state. While these laws vary, most states, including Florida, award all electoral votes to the candidate for either office who receives a [[Plurality voting|plurality]] of the state's popular vote. Any candidate who receives an absolute majority of all electoral votes nationally (270 since 1963) wins the presidential or vice presidential election.

According to legal analyst [[Jeffrey Toobin]], later analysis showed that a total of 18 counties—accounting for a quarter of all votes cast in Florida—did not carry out the legally mandated machine recount, but "No one from the Gore campaign ever challenged this view" that the machine recount had been completed.<ref>Toobin, Jeffrey.

Gore did not, however, request any recounts in counties that traditionally vote Republican. The four counties granted the request and began manual recounts. However, Florida law also required all counties to certify their election returns to the Florida secretary of state within seven days of the election;<ref>''See'' Fla. Stat. § 102.112. {{cite web|url=http://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&Search_String=&URL=Ch0102/SEC112.HTM&Title=-%3e2000-%3eCh0102-%3eSection+112|title=The 2000 Florida Statutes, Title IX, Chapter 102, Section 112|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010421220910/http://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&Search_String=&URL=Ch0102%2FSEC112.HTM&Title=-%3E2000-%3ECh0102-%3ESection+112|archivedate=April 21, 2001|url-status=dead}} (This archived version of the Florida statute is dated April 21, 2001, and is from Archive.org.)</ref> and several of the counties conducting manual recounts did not believe they could meet this deadline.

On November 14, the statutory deadline, the Florida Circuit Court ruled that the seven-day deadline was mandatory but that the counties could amend their returns at a later date. The court also ruled that the secretary of state, after "considering all attendant facts and circumstances," had discretion to include any late amended returns in the statewide certification.<ref name="l1114">{{cite web|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/docs/florida2000/11-14_leonruling.pdf|title=Leon County Judge Rules on Certification|accessdate=October 28, 2006}}</ref> Before the 5&nbsp;p.m. deadline on November 14, Volusia County had completed its manual recount and certified its results.

She further announced that after she received the certified returns of the overseas absentee ballots from each county, she would certify the results of the presidential election on November 18.<ref name="fsc1"/> However, on November 17, the Florida Supreme Court enjoined Harris from certifying the election while it heard appeals from the various cases in progress.<ref name="fsc1" /> On November 21, it allowed continuation of the manual recounts and delayed certification until November 26.<ref name="fsc1" />

==Stay of the Florida recount==
[[File:FlaSupremeCrtBldgFeb08.JPG|thumb|right|Florida Supreme Court]]
By December 8, 2000, there had been multiple court decisions regarding the presidential election in Florida.<ref>For example, the [[concurring opinion]] in ''Bush v. Gore'' cited the December 6, 2000, decision in ''Touchston v. McDermott'', [http://www.precydent.com/citation/234/F.3d/1133 234 F.3d 1130] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081209121021/http://www.precydent.com/citation/234/F.3d/1133|date=December 9, 2008}} (11th Cir. 2000).</ref> On that date the Florida Supreme Court, by a 4–3 vote, ordered a statewide manual recount of undervotes.<ref>{{cite web|title=Supreme Court of Florida No. SC00-2431 ''Gore v. Harris'' 772 S2d 1243|url=https://caselaw.findlaw.com/fl-supreme-court/1489353.html|date=December 8, 2000|publisher=Findlaw|accessdate=November 24, 2020}}</ref> On December 9, ruling in response to an emergency request by Bush, the U.S. Supreme Court [[Stay of execution|stayed]] the recount. The Court also decided to treat Bush's application for relief as a petition for a writ of [[certiorari]], [[s:Bush_v._Gore/Certiorari/Order|granted that petition]], requested briefing from the parties by 4 p.m. on December 10, and scheduled oral argument for the morning of December 11.

Although opinions are rarely issued in connection with grants of certiorari (a minimum of four of the nine justices must vote in favor of the grant), Justice Scalia filed an opinion concurring in the Court's decision, noting that "a brief response is necessary to [Justice Stevens's] dissent". According to Scalia, 

{{quote|It suffices to say that the issuance of the stay suggests that a majority of the Court, while not deciding the issues presented, believe that the petitioner has a substantial probability of success. The issue is not, as the dissent puts it, whether "counting every legally cast vote can constitute irreparable harm." One of the principal issues in the appeal we have accepted is precisely whether the votes that have been ordered to be counted are, under a reasonable interpretation of Florida law, "legally cast vote[s]." The counting of votes that are of questionable legality does in my view threaten irreparable harm to petitioner Bush, and to the country, by casting a cloud upon what he claims to be the legitimacy of his election. Count first, and rule upon legality afterwards, is not a recipe for producing election results that have the public acceptance democratic stability requires.<ref name=Dissent>{{ws|[[s:Bush v. Gore/Certiorari/Dissent|''Bush v. Gore'' on Application for Stay]]}}</ref>}}

Justice Stevens's dissenting opinion was joined by Justices Souter, Ginsburg, and Breyer. According to Stevens,

{{quote|To stop the counting of legal votes, the majority today departs from three venerable rules of judicial restraint that have guided the Court throughout its history. On questions of state law, we have consistently respected the opinions of the highest courts of the States. On questions whose resolution is committed at least in large measure to another branch of the Federal Government, we have construed our own jurisdiction narrowly and exercised it cautiously. On federal constitutional questions that were not fairly presented to the court whose judgment is being reviewed, we have prudently declined to express an opinion. The majority has acted unwisely. … [A] stay should not be granted unless an applicant makes a substantial showing of a likelihood of irreparable harm. In this case, petitioners have failed to carry that heavy burden. Counting every legally cast vote cannot constitute irreparable harm. On the other hand, there is a danger that a stay may cause irreparable harm to respondents–and, more importantly, the public at large … . Preventing the recount from being completed will inevitably cast a cloud on the legitimacy of the election.<ref name=Dissent/>}}

A number of legal scholars have agreed with the dissenters' argument that Bush failed to carry the "heavy burden" of demonstrating a  "likelihood of irreparable harm."<ref name="auto">{{cite journal|last1=Balkin|first1=Jack M.|title=Bush v.

==Rapid developments==
The [[oral argument]] in ''Bush v. Gore'' occurred on December 11.<ref>[https://www.oyez.org/cases/2000-2009/2000/2000_00_949/argument/ Transcript and audio of oral arguments in ''Bush v. Gore''], via [[Oyez.org]]. Retrieved 2008-06-05.</ref> [[Theodore Olson]], a Washington, D.C., lawyer, delivered Bush's oral argument. New York lawyer [[David Boies]] argued for Gore.

During the brief period when the U.S. Supreme Court was deliberating on ''Bush v. Gore'', the Florida Supreme Court provided clarifications of its November 21 decision in ''[[Palm Beach County Canvassing Board v. Harris (Harris I)]]'',<ref name="PvH"/> which the U.S. Supreme Court had requested on December 4 following arguments in the case of ''Bush v. Palm Beach County Canvassing Board''.<ref name=BushvPBCCB>{{ussc|name=Bush v. Palm Beach County Canvassing Board|531|70|2000}}</ref> Because of the extraordinary nature and argued urgency of the case, the U.S. Supreme Court issued its opinion in ''Bush v. Gore'' on December 12, 2000, a day after hearing oral argument.

==Relevant law==
{{main|Electoral Count Act}}
The [[Equal Protection Clause]] of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] is the U.S. Constitutional provision on which the decision in ''Bush v. Gore'' was based.<ref name="BushVGore103">{{ussc|name=Bush v. Gore|volume=531|page=98|pin=103|year=2000}} ("The petition presents the following questions: whether the Florida Supreme Court established new standards for resolving Presidential election contests, thereby violating Art. II, § 1, cl. 2, of the United States Constitution and failing to comply with 3 U. S. C. § 5, and whether the use of standardless manual recounts violates the Equal Protection and Due Process clauses.")</ref>

[[Article Two of the United States Constitution#Clause 2: Method of choosing electors|Article II, § 1, cl. 2]] of the Constitution specifies the number of electors per state, and, most relevant to this case,<ref name="BushVGore103"/> specifies the manner in which those electors are selected, stipulating that:

{{quote|Each State shall appoint, in such Manner as the Legislature thereof may direct, a Number of Electors{{nbsp}}...}}

This clause arguably gives power to only one branch of Florida's state government (i.e., the state legislature).<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i2gUgRh_HTgC&pg=PA82 |page=82|title=The Votes That Counted: How the Court Decided the 2000 Presidential Election|isbn=9780226294087|last1=Gillman|first1=Howard|date=July 5, 2003}}</ref>

Section 2 of the [[Electoral Count Act]], now codified in [[s:United States Code/Title 3/Chapter 1#§ 5. Determination of controversy as to appointment of electors|3 U.S.C. § 5]], regulates the "determination of controversy as to appointment of electors"<ref name="usc3-5title">{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/3/5.shtml|title=US CODE: Title 3,5. Determination of controversy as to appointment of electors}} The quote is the title of Section 5, Title 3.</ref> in presidential elections. Of particular relevance<ref name="BushVGore103"/> to this case was the so-called "[[Safe harbor (law)|safe harbor]]" provision, which assures Congress' deference to states in their appointments of electors if done by a specified deadline:

{{quote|If any State shall have provided [...] for its final determination of [...] the appointment of all or any of the electors of such State [...] at least six days before the time fixed for the meeting of the electors, such determination [...] shall be conclusive.<ref name="usc3-5">{{Cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/3/5|title=3 U.S. Code § 5 - Determination of controversy as to appointment of electors|website=LII / Legal Information Institute}}</ref>}}

Since the electors were set to meet December 18, the discretional "safe harbor" deadline was December 12, just one day after the Court heard oral arguments in this case.

According to {{UnitedStatesCode|28|1257}}:

{{quote|Final judgments or decrees rendered by the highest court of a State in which a decision could be had, may be reviewed by the Supreme Court by writ of ''[[certiorari]]'' where the validity of a treaty or statute of the United States is drawn in question or where the validity of a statute of any State is drawn in question on the ground of its being repugnant to the Constitution, treaties, or laws of the United States{{nbsp}}...}}

==Issues considered by the Court==
[[File:Theodore Olson.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Theodore Olson]] represented Bush]] The Court had to resolve two different questions to fully resolve the case:
*Were the recounts, as they were being conducted, constitutional?<ref name="zpc000">Id. "Seven Justices of the Court agree that there are constitutional problems with the recount ordered by the Florida Supreme Court that demand a remedy." Last paragraph in Part II.</ref>
*If the recounts were unconstitutional, what is the remedy?<ref name="zpc001">Id. "The only disagreement is as to the remedy." Last paragraph in Part II.</ref>

Three days earlier, the five-Justice majority had ordered the recount stopped,<ref name="ss">{{cite news|url=http://archives.cnn.com/2000/LAW/12/10/scalia.stevens/|title=Scalia and Stevens clash over recount stay in Bush v. Gore|publisher=CNN|date=December 11, 2000|accessdate=April 27, 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090508074956/http://archives.cnn.com/2000/LAW/12/10/scalia.stevens/|archivedate=May 8, 2009|df=mdy}}</ref> and the Court had to decide whether to restart it.

===Equal Protection Clause===
Bush argued that recounts in Florida violated the Equal Protection Clause because Florida did not have a statewide vote recount standard. Each county was on its own to determine whether a given ballot was an acceptable one. Two voters could have marked their ballots in an identical manner, but the ballot in one county would be counted while the ballot in a different county would be rejected, because of the conflicting manual recount standards.<ref name="bushbrief1">{{cite web|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/docs/florida2000/12-10_bushbrief.pdf|title=Bush v. Gore, Brief for Petitioners}} "The Equal Protection Clause prohibits government officials from implementing an electoral system that gives the votes of similarly situated voters different effect based on the happenstance of the county or district in which those voters live." Paragraph 2 in Argument, Part III-A.</ref>

Gore argued that there was indeed a statewide standard, the "intent of the voter" standard, and that this standard was sufficient under the Equal Protection Clause.<ref name="gorebrief1">{{cite web|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/docs/florida2000/12-10_gorebrief.pdf|title=Bush v. Gore, Brief of Respondent}} "The court below was quite insistent that the counting of ballots must be governed by a single uniform standard: the intent of the voter must control." Paragraph 3 in Argument, Part III-A.</ref> Furthermore, Gore argued that the consequence of ruling the Florida recount unconstitutional simply because it treated different voters differently would effectively render ''every'' state election unconstitutional<ref name="gorebrief1b">Id. "...{{nbsp}}if petitioners mean to say that all votes must be tabulated under a fixed and mechanical standard (e.g., the "two-corner chad rule"), their approach would render unconstitutional the laws of States that hinge the meaning of the ballot on the intent of the voter{{nbsp}}..." Paragraph 3 in Argument, Part III-A.</ref> and that each voting mechanism has a different rate of error in counting votes. Voters in a "punch-card" county have a greater chance of having their votes undercounted than voters in an "optical scanner" county. If Bush prevails, Gore argued, every state would have to have one statewide method of recording votes to be constitutional.[[File:David Boies by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|upright|[[David Boies]] represented Gore]]
This was the most closely decided issue in the case. The arguments presented by counsel did not extensively address what the Court should do if the Court were to find an equal protection violation. However, Gore did argue briefly that the appropriate remedy would not be to cancel all recounts, but rather would be to order a proper recount.<ref name="gorebrief3">{{cite web|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/docs/florida2000/12-10_gorebrief.pdf|title=Bush v. Gore, Brief of Respondent}} "[T]he appropriate remedy for either an Equal Protection Clause or Due Process Clause violation would not be to cancel all recounts, but rather to order that the recounts be undertaken under a uniform standard." Footnote 28.</ref>

===Article II===
Bush also argued that the Florida Supreme Court's ruling violated [[Article Two of the United States Constitution#Clause 2: Method of choosing electors|Article II, § 1, cl. 2]] of the U.S. Constitution. Essentially, Bush argued that the Florida Supreme Court's interpretation of Florida law was so erroneous that its ruling had the effect of making new law. Since this "new law" had not been directed by the Florida legislature, it violated Article II. Bush argued that Article II gives the federal judiciary the power to interpret state election law in presidential elections to ensure that the intent of the state legislature is followed.<ref name="bushbrief2">{{cite web|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/docs/florida2000/12-10_bushbrief.pdf|title=Bush v. Gore, Brief for Petitioners}} "By rewriting that statutory scheme—thus arrogating to itself the power to decide the manner in which Florida's electors are chosen—the Florida Supreme Court substituted its judgment for that of the legislature in violation of Article II. Such a usurpation of constitutionally delegated power defies the Framers' plan." Paragraph 2 in Argument, Part I.</ref>

Gore argued that Article II presupposes judicial review and interpretation of state statutes, and that the Florida Supreme Court did nothing more than exercise the routine principles of statutory construction to reach its decision.<ref name="gorebrief2">{{cite web|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/docs/florida2000/12-10_gorebrief.pdf|title=Bush v. Gore, Brief of Respondent}} "Even apart from the absurd theory that McPherson requires everything relevant to a state's process for choosing electors to be packed into a specialized presidential electoral code, the very premise of petitioner's argument is fatally flawed because the Florida Legislature re-enacted the contest statute in 1999 against the settled background rule that decisions of circuit courts in contest actions are subject to appellate review." Paragraph 5 in Argument, Part I.</ref>

==Decision==
In brief, the breakdown of the decision was:
*Seven justices agreed that there was an Equal Protection Clause violation in using differing standards of determining a valid vote in different counties, causing an "unequal evaluation of ballots in various respects".<ref name="oyez2">{{cite web|url=https://www.oyez.org/cases/2000-2009/2000/2000_00_949|title=Bush v. Gore|publisher=Oyez Project|accessdate=January 22, 2011}} "Noting that the Equal Protection clause guarantees individuals that their ballots cannot be devalued by 'later arbitrary and disparate treatment,' the per curiam opinion held 7–2 that the Florida Supreme Court's scheme for recounting ballots was unconstitutional."</ref> The ''per curiam'' opinion (representing the views of Justices Kennedy, O'Connor, Rehnquist, Scalia, and Thomas) specifically cited that:
** Palm Beach County changed standards for counting dimpled chads several times during the counting process;
** Broward County used less restrictive standards than Palm Beach County;
** Miami-Dade County’s recount of rejected ballots [[Brooks Brothers riot|did not include all precincts]];
** The Florida Supreme Court did not specify who would recount the ballots.
:The ''per curiam'' opinion also identified an inconsistency with the fact that the Florida statewide recount of rejected ballots was limited to undervotes. The opinion implied that a constitutionally valid recount would include not only Florida's undervotes, but also its overvotes. The ''per curiam'' expressed concern that the limited scope of Florida’s recount would mean that, unlike some undervotes found to be reclaimable, valid votes among the overvotes would not be reclaimed.{{efn|group=a|Unknown at the time, but observed in the later media recounts, there was a significant number of such valid overvotes found among the rejected ballots in optical scan counties, which largely favored Gore.}} Furthermore, if a machine incorrectly reads an overvote as a valid vote for one of two marked candidates instead of rejecting it, Florida would wrongly count what should be an invalid vote.{{efn|group=a|The opinion does not suggest a practical method for searching for and manually identifying such ballots among the thousands of legally cast and counted ballots with which they would be mixed.<ref name="Lund">{{cite journal|journal=Cardozo Law Review|first=Nelson Robert|last=Lund|url=https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=267874|title=The Unbearable Rightness of Bush v.

Souter, joined by Breyer, Ginsburg and Stevens, said, "But no State is required to conform to §5 if it cannot do that (for whatever reason); the sanction for failing to satisfy the conditions of §5 is simply loss of what has been  called its 'safe harbor.' And even that determination is to be made, if made anywhere, in the Congress."<ref name="souter"/> Justices Souter and Breyer wanted to remand the case to the Florida Supreme Court to permit that court to establish uniform standards of what constituted a legal vote for a manual recount of all rejected ballots using those standards.<ref name="breyer">{{Cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/00-949.ZD1.html|title=BUSH v.

===Equal Protection Clause===
The Supreme Court, in a ''per curiam'' opinion, ruled that the Florida Supreme Court's decision, calling for a statewide recount, violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. This ruling was by a 7–2 vote, though per curiam opinions are usually issued only for unanimous votes. Kennedy has since been identified as the primary author of the opinion. In addition to writing the opinion, Kennedy also decided to include Souter, Breyer and Stevens in the majority without consulting them, initially intending the ''per curiam'' opinion to have the vote count listed as 8–1 for the Equal Protections Clause issue (though not the remedy), rather than 7–2. Stevens demanded his name be removed from the majority, which Kennedy agreed to only after Stevens pulled his name from Breyer's dissent. Breyer also objected in private, but he was left as part of the majority. Later interviews by ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' indicated that Breyer and Souter were trying to appeal to Kennedy to join them on the remedy, rather than actually agreeing that an equal protection violation had occurred.<ref name="Vanity"/> Jack Balkin, writing in Yale Law Journal, considered this to be a cheap trick to construct the illusion of a larger majority, likening it to "saying that two doctors agree that a patient is sick, but one wants to use leeches, and the other wants to prescribe antibiotics".<ref name="auto"/>

The Court held that the Equal Protection Clause guarantees to individuals that their ballots cannot be devalued by "later arbitrary and disparate treatment". Even if the recount was fair in theory, it was unfair in practice. The record, as weighed by the Florida Supreme Court, suggested that different standards were seemingly applied to the recount from ballot to ballot, precinct to precinct, and county to county, even when identical types of ballots and machines were used.<ref>Justices Breyer and Souter stated:<blockquote>It is true that the Equal Protection Clause does not forbid the use of a variety of voting mechanisms within a jurisdiction, even though different mechanisms will have different levels of effectiveness in recording voters' intentions; local variety can be justified by concerns about cost, the potential value of innovation, and so on. But evidence in the record here suggests that a different order of disparity obtains under rules for determining a voter's intent that have been applied (and could continue to be applied) to identical types of ballots used in identical brands of machines and exhibiting identical physical characteristics (such as "hanging" or "dimpled" chads).</blockquote></ref>

According to the Court, the statewide standard (that a "legal vote" is "one in which there is a 'clear indication of the intent of the voter'"<ref name="zpc">{{cite web |url=http://straylight.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/00-949.ZPC.html |title=Bush v. Gore, US Supreme Court Opinion}} Id. 5th paragraph in Part I.</ref>) could not guarantee that each county would count the votes in a constitutionally permissible fashion. The Court stated that the ''per curiam'' opinion's applicability was "limited to the present circumstances, for the problem of equal protection in election processes generally presents many complexities." However, the Court did not state what those complexities were, nor did it explain (or apparently consider) why the absence of a constitutionally acceptable standard for counting votes, which was the basis for the Court's ruling, would not have invalidated the entire presidential election in Florida.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Gershman |first1=Bennet L. |title=Justice Scalia's Faux Originalism |url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/justice-scalias-faux-orig_b_9265726 |website=HuffPost |accessdate=April 15, 2020}}</ref>

Critics would later point out that the court had denied certiorari on equal protection grounds when Bush first sought Supreme Court review.<ref name="Vanity"/> Law clerks who worked for Kennedy and O'Connor at the time would later state their belief that the justices settled on equal protection as grounds for their decision, rather than Article II, because they thought it would seem more fair.<ref name="Vanity"/>

====Remedy====
The Court ruled 5–4 that no constitutionally valid recount could be completed by a December 12 "safe harbor" deadline. The Court asserted that "the Supreme Court of Florida has said that the legislature intended the State's electors to 'participat[e] fully in the federal electoral process,' as provided in {{usc|3|5}}." The Court therefore effectively ended the proposed recount, because "the Florida Legislature intended to obtain the safe-harbor benefits of 3 U.S.C. §5." Souter said bluntly, "The 3 U.S.C. §5 issue is not serious."<ref name="souter"/> Breyer's dissent stated, "By halting the manual recount, and thus ensuring that uncounted legal votes will not be counted under any standard, this Court crafts a remedy out of proportion to the asserted harm. And that remedy harms the very fairness interests the Court is attempting to protect."<ref name="breyer"/>

Four justices (Stevens, Ginsburg, Souter and Breyer) had dissented from the Court's earlier (December 9) decision, by the same five-justice majority, to grant Bush's emergency request to stop the recount and grant certiorari. In their dissents from the Court's December 12 ''per curiam'' opinion, Breyer and Souter acknowledged that the counting up until December 9 had not conformed with equal protection requirements. However, Souter and Breyer favored remanding the case to the Florida Supreme Court for the purpose of crafting specific guidelines for how to count disputed ballots, in contrast to the majority's decision to halt the recount altogether.<ref>Toobin, Jeffrey (2007). '' The Nine: Inside the Secret World of the Supreme Court '', pp. 184, (Doubleday, New York, NY).</ref> The actual counting had ended with the December 9 ruling, issued three days before any deadline.<ref name="ss"/>

The dissenting opinions strongly criticized the five-justice majority for involving the Court in state-level affairs. Justice Stevens's dissent (joined by Justices Breyer and Ginsburg) concluded as follows:<ref name="stevens">{{cite web |url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/00-949.ZD.html |title=BUSH v. GORE}}</ref>

{{quote|What must underlie petitioners' entire federal assault on the Florida election procedures is an unstated lack of confidence in the impartiality and capacity of the state judges who would make the critical decisions if the vote count were to proceed. Otherwise, their position is wholly without merit. The endorsement of that position by the majority of this Court can only lend credence to the most cynical appraisal of the work of judges throughout the land. It is confidence in the men and women who administer the judicial system that is the true backbone of the rule of law. Time will one day heal the wound to that confidence that will be inflicted by today's decision. One thing, however, is certain. Although we may never know with complete certainty the identity of the winner of this year's Presidential election, the identity of the loser is perfectly clear. It is the Nation's confidence in the judge as an impartial guardian of the rule of law.}}

The ''per curiam'' opinion did not technically dismiss the case and instead "remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion." Gore's attorneys therefore understood that they could fight on and could petition the Florida Supreme Court to repudiate the notion that December 12 was final under Florida law.<ref name="Post">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ntgPjFww1acC&pg=PA230 |page=230–234 |title=Deadlock the Inside Story of America's Closest Election |isbn=9781586480806 |last1=Drehle |first1=David Von |publisher=Washington Post Company |last2=Nakashima |first2=Ellen |date=March 8, 2001}}</ref>

However, Gore dropped the case, reportedly because he was not optimistic about how the Florida justices would react to further arguments and, as one of his advisers put it, "the best Gore could hope for was a slate of disputed electors."<ref name="Post"/> In addition, Gore campaign chairman [[William M. Daley|Bill Daley]] argued that fighting on was futile because even if the Florida Supreme Court defied the U.S. Supreme Court and ordered a new recount, "the [[Republican Party (U.S.)|GOP]] would take them straight back to [[Washington D.C.|Washington]], where the [U.S.] Supreme Court would repeat: 'You ain't going to count, okay? So quit bothering us.'"<ref>{{cite news|last=Von|first=David|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/2001/02/03/anxious-moments-in-the-final-stretch/b885749a-d869-4d3d-a44b-a01948e9180b/|title=Anxious Moments In the Final Stretch|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=2001-02-03|accessdate=2017-04-21}}</ref>

On remand, the Florida Supreme Court issued an opinion on December 22 that did not dispute whether December 12 was the deadline for recounts under state law, although this was disputed in a concurring opinion by Florida Supreme Court Justice Leander Shaw who nevertheless expressed deference to the U.S. Supreme Court's view on this issue and who also argued that, in any case, the Florida Supreme Court would (in his opinion) be unable to craft a remedy which would satisfy all of the U.S. Supreme Court's equal protection, due process, and other concerns.<ref>''Gore v. Harris'', [http://www.floridasupremecourt.org/decisions/pre2004/ops/sc00-2431-remand.pdf 773 So. 2d 524] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080625062307/http://www.floridasupremecourt.org/decisions/pre2004/ops/sc00-2431-remand.pdf|date=June 25, 2008}} (December 22, 2000). Only Florida Supreme Court Justice Leander Shaw, in a concurring opinion, disputed that December 12 was the deadline for recounts under state law. Justice Shaw had joined the dissenting opinion in ''Gore v. Harris'' before the ruling in ''Bush v. Gore''.</ref>

===Article II===
Chief Justice Rehnquist's [[concurring opinion]], joined by Justices Scalia and Thomas, began by emphasizing that this was an unusual case in which the Constitution requires federal courts to assess whether a state supreme court has properly interpreted the will of the state legislature. Usually, federal courts do not make that type of assessment, and indeed the ''per curiam'' opinion in this case did not do so. After addressing this aspect of the case, Rehnquist examined and agreed with arguments that had been made by the dissenting justices of the Florida Supreme Court.

Rehnquist also mentioned that he, along with Justices Scalia and Thomas, joined the Supreme Court's ''per curiam'' opinion and agreed with the legal analysis that was presented there.

==Scholarly analyses==
''Bush v. Gore'' prompted many strong reactions from scholars, pundits and others regarding the Court's decision, with a majority of publications in law reviews being critical. An analysis in ''[[The Georgetown Law Journal]]'' found that 78 scholarly articles were published about the case between 2001 and 2004, with 35 criticizing the decision and 11 defending it.<ref name="auto2">{{cite web|last=Cole|first=David|year=2006|title=The Liberal Legacy of Bush v. Gore|url=https://scholarship.law.georgetown.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1417&context=facpub|publisher=Georgetown University Law Center}}</ref> 

===The critical remedial issue===
The most closely decided aspect of the case was the key question of what remedy the Court should order, in view of an Equal Protection Clause violation. Gore had argued for a new recount that would pass constitutional muster, but the Court instead chose to end the election. Citing two Florida Supreme Court opinions, ''Gore v. Harris'' (December 8, seemingly in error)<ref name="sunstein"/> and ''Palm Beach County Canvassing Board v. Harris'' (November 21, footnote 55),<ref name="fsc1"/> the U.S. Supreme Court asserted that "the Florida Supreme Court has said that the Florida Legislature intended to obtain the safe-harbor benefits of 3 U.S.C. § 5" and that "any recount seeking to meet the December 12 date will be unconstitutional." This assertion has proven very controversial.

Finding that reasoning not to be persuasive, [[Michael W. McConnell]] writes that the two Florida court opinions cited by the Supreme Court supply no authoritative pronouncement of an absolute deadline.<ref name="sunstein">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UMy-1YdP7jQC&pg=PA118 |page=118-119 |title=The Vote: Bush, Gore, and the Supreme Court |isbn=9780226213071 |last1=Sunstein |first1=Cass R. |last2=Epstein |first2=Richard A. |date=October 2001}}</ref> As better support for December 12 being the deadline under state law, McConnell points to two footnotes in the Florida Supreme Court's December 11 response on remand in ''[[Palm Beach County Canvassing Board v. Harris (Harris I)]]'', which he says must not have come to the justices' attention. Footnotes 17 and 22 characterized the safe harbor date of December 12 as an "outside deadline." Therefore, he writes, although these passages may not justify the U.S Supreme Court's decision, since the Court did not rely on them, "the Court may have reached the right result for the wrong reason." These footnotes state:<ref name="PvH">''Palm Beach County Canvassing Board v. Harris'', [http://www.floridasupremecourt.org/decisions/pre2004/ops/sc00-2346.pdf 772 S2d 1273] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080625062305/http://www.floridasupremecourt.org/decisions/pre2004/ops/sc00-2346.pdf |date=June 25, 2008 }} (Fla December 11, 2000).</ref>

{{quote|[17] What is a reasonable time required for completion will, in part, depend on whether the election is for a statewide office, for a federal office or for presidential electors. In the case of the presidential election, the determination of reasonableness must be circumscribed by the provisions of 3 U.S.C. § 5, which sets December 12, 2000, as the date for final determination of any state's dispute concerning its electors for that determination to be given conclusive effect in Congress ... [22] As always, it is necessary to read all provisions of the elections code in ''pari materia''. In this case, that comprehensive reading required that there be time for an elections contest pursuant to section 102.168, which all parties had agreed was a necessary component of the statutory scheme and to accommodate the outside deadline set forth in 3 U.S.C. § 5 of December 12, 2000.}}

According to Nelson Lund, former law clerk to Justice O'Connor and associate counsel to [[George H. W. Bush]],<ref name="nyt1989">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/01/23/us/bush-s-team-the-first-choices.html|work=The New York Times|title=Bush's Team: The First Choices|date=1989-01-23|page=A00020}}</ref> a dissenter might argue that the Florida Supreme Court on remand in ''Harris I'' was discussing the "protest provisions of the Florida Election Code, whereas the issues in ''Bush v. Gore'' arose under the contest provisions." In retort, Lund writes that the Florida court's decision in the contest case did not mention any alternative possible deadlines.<ref>Lund, Nelson.

Harris'', [http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/docs/florida2000/12-08_supreme_decision.pdf 772 S2d 1243] (December 8, 2000), as evidence that the Florida Supreme Court thought all recounts had to be completed by December 12, 2008.</ref> Nevertheless, Greene concludes "lack of clarity about the Florida Supreme Court's views on the safe-harbor provision should have resulted in a remand to that court for clarification,"<ref name="Greene"/> in addition to the remand of December 4.<ref name=BushvPBCCB/> The Court in ''Bush v. Gore'' did remand the case instead of dismissing it, but the remand did not include another request for clarification. [[Louise Weinberg]] argues that even giving the U.S. Supreme Court the benefit of the doubt that it acted appropriately in intervening in Florida state law, its actions should be deemed unconstitutional because its intervention was not coupled with any kind of remedy aimed at determining the actual outcome of the election.<ref>Weinberg, Louise. [http://www.utexas.edu/law/faculty/lweinberg/bushvgore.pdf] in ''When Courts Decide Elections: The Constitutionality of Bush v. Gore'', 82 Boston University Law Review 609 (2002), p. 33.{{quote|In Bush v. Gore, on the contrary, the Court actively prevented the completion of a halted state recount, never having ruled on the merits either of the challenge or the election and never having adjudicated the validity of Bush's certification or Gore's request for a recount. Instead, the Court selected the next President of the United States in the absence of a completed election—the ultimate political act. A meaningful remand in Bush v. Gore, or completing the election under the Court's own supervision, would have preserved the Constitution from this assault.}}</ref>

===Accusation of partisanship or conflict of interest===
According to legal analyst [[Jeffrey Toobin]], "''Bush v. Gore'' broke David Souter's heart. ''The day the music died'', he called it. It was so political, so ''transparently'' political, that it scarred Souter's belief in the Supreme Court as an institution." (emphasis in original)<ref>{{cite book|first=Jeffrey|last=Toobin|title=The Oath: The Obama White House and the Supreme Court|year=2012|page=123|publisher=Doubleday}}</ref>

Various authors have claimed that conservative Republican-appointed justices ruled against Gore in this case for partisan reasons.<ref name="Dersh"/> [[Harvard University]] law professor [[Alan Dershowitz]] writes:
{{quote|[T]he decision in the Florida election case may be ranked as the single most corrupt decision in Supreme Court history, because it is the only one that I know of where the majority justices decided as they did because of the personal identity and political affiliation of the litigants.

[[Chapman University School of Law]] professor [[Ronald Rotunda]] responded that Democratic-appointed justices of the Florida Supreme Court also ruled against Gore:

There has also been analysis of whether several justices had a [[conflict of interest]] that should have forced them to [[Judicial disqualification|recuse]] themselves from the decision. On several occasions, Rehnquist had expressed interest in retiring under a Republican administration; one study found that press reports "are equivocal on whether facts existed that would have created a conflict of interest" for Rehnquist. At an election night party, O'Connor became upset when the media initially announced that Gore had won Florida, her husband explaining that they would have to wait another four years before retiring to Arizona.<ref name="Neumann">{{cite journal |url=http://scholarlycommons.law.hofstra.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1117&context=faculty_scholarship |title=Conflicts of interest in Bush v.

According to Steven Foster of the [[Manchester Grammar School]]:

{{quote|On the eve of the election Sandra Day O'Connor had made a public statement that a Gore victory would be a personal disaster for her. Clarence Thomas's wife was so intimately involved in the Bush campaign that she was helping to draw up a list of Bush appointees more or less at the same time as her husband was adjudicating on whether the same man would become the next President. Finally, Antonin Scalia's son was working for the firm appointed by Bush to argue his case before the Supreme Court, the head of which was subsequently appointed as Solicitor-General.<ref>{{cite book|first=Steven|last=Foster|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1c6qBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=The Judiciary, Civil Liberties and Human Rights|year=2006|publisher=[[Edinburgh University Press]]|isbn=0-7486-2262-4|page=80}}</ref>}}

The day after Thanksgiving, when the conservative justices agreed to hear Bush's appeal in the case of ''[[Bush v. Palm Beach County Canvassing Board]]'' (excluding Bush's equal protection claim), the opposing justices were convinced that the majority intended to reverse the Florida Supreme Court and shut down the recount. They began drafting a dissent before this case was argued before them, a dissent that was temporarily shelved upon the Court's unanimous remand to the Florida court.<ref name="Vanity"/> 

The liberal law clerks noted Justice Scalia later had begun campaigning for the stay of the Florida court's December 8 recount order before the Court had received Gore's response to Bush's request and was so incensed at Stevens's dissent in the matter of the stay and grant of certiorari, that he requested the release of opinions be delayed so that he could amend his opinion to include a response to Stevens. Kennedy is also reported to have sent out a memo which accused the dissenters of "trashing the court". Later, court personnel, as well as [[Ron Klain]], speculated that there was an unspoken understanding that the judges on the winning side would not retire until after the next election, as a way of preserving some sense of fairness. Indeed, no Supreme Court justices retired during President Bush's first term.<ref name="Vanity"/>

It has been argued that none of the justices ended up voting in a way that was consistent with their prior legal jurisprudence,<ref name="auto"/><ref name="auto2"/>though this conclusion has been challenged by George Mason University law professor Nelson Lund.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.floridalawreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/Lund_BOOK.pdf|first=Nelson|last=Lund|work=Florida Law Review|page=1001-1010|year=2009|volume=61|title=Bush v. Gore at the Dawning of the Age of Obama}}</ref> The five conservative justices decided to involve the federal judiciary in a matter that could have been left to the states, while also expanding the previous US Supreme Court interpretations of the Equal Protection Clause. Meanwhile, the liberal justices all supported leaving the matter in the hands of a state and also sometimes advocated in favor of a narrower reading of existing Equal Protection Clause SCOTUS precedents. This increased the perceptions that the judges used their desired results to drive their reasoning, instead of using legal reasoning to arrive at a result. David Cole of Georgetown Law argued that, as a way of trying to rehabilitate the court's image after ''Bush v. Gore'', the court became more likely to reach a liberal decision in the four years after ''Bush v. Gore'' than they had been before the case, and that the conservative justices were more likely to join the liberals rather than the other way around.<ref name="auto2"/>

===Recount by media organizations===
In 2001, the [[National Opinion Research Center]] (NORC) at the [[University of Chicago]], sponsored by a consortium of major United States news organizations, conducted the [[2000 United States presidential election recount in Florida#Florida Ballot Project recounts|Florida Ballot Project]], a comprehensive review of 175,010 ballots that vote-counting machines had rejected from the entire state, not just the disputed counties that were recounted.<ref name="FBP">{{cite web|url=http://www.norc.uchicago.edu/fl/index.asp|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20011217183836/http://www.norc.uchicago.edu/fl/index.asp|archivedate=December 17, 2001 |title=Florida Ballots Project |publisher=National Opinion Research Center|accessdate=May 28, 2010}}</ref> The project's goal was to determine the reliability and accuracy of the systems used in the voting process, including how different systems correlated with voter mistakes. The study was conducted over a period of 10 months. Based on the review, the media group concluded that if the disputes over the validity of all the ballots in question had been consistently resolved and any uniform standard applied, the electoral result would have been reversed and Gore would have won by 60 to 171 votes.<ref name="battle">{{cite book|editor-last=deHaven-Smith|editor-first=Lance| pages=15, 37–41|publisher=University Press of Florida|year=2005|location=Gainesville, Florida, United States| title=The Battle for Florida: An Annotated Compendium of Materials from the 2000 Presidential Election}}</ref> On the other hand, under scenarios involving review of limited sets of ballots uncounted by machines, Bush would have kept his lead. In one such scenario — Al Gore's request for recounts in four predominantly Democratic counties — Bush would have won by 225 votes.{{efn|group=a|Specifically, Gore's request for recounts in four counties: applies the "prevailing standard" (at least one corner of chad detached on punch card undervotes; any affirmative mark on optical scan ballots, but with no overvotes) to remaining uncounted ballots in Miami-Dade; accepts uncertified hand counts from Palm Beach and 139 precincts in Miami-Dade and certified counts from other 65 counties.}} In another scenario (if the remaining 64 Florida counties had carried out the hand recount of disputed ballots ordered by the Florida Supreme Court on December 8, applying the various standards that county election officials said they would have used), Bush would have emerged the victor by 493 votes.{{efn|group=a|Specifically, Florida Supreme Court order as being implemented: accepts completed recounts in eight counties and certified counts from four counties that refused to recount; applies the "county custom standard" (what each individual county canvassing board considered a vote, in regard to both undervotes and overvotes) to remaining Miami-Dade and other 55 counties.}}<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/11/12/us/examining-vote-overview-study-disputed-florida-ballots-finds-justices-did-not.html|title=Examining the Vote: the Overview|first1=Ford|last1=Fessenden|first2=John M.|last2=Broder|publisher=The New York Times|date=November 12, 2001}}</ref>

Further analysis revealed that black-majority precincts had three times as many rejected ballots as white precincts. "For minorities, the ballot survey found, a recount would not have redressed the inequities because most ballots were beyond retrieving.

[https://books.google.com/books?id=S3EM-hS9WB4C&pg=PA3&lpg=PA3&dq=%22Unreasonable+Reaction+to+a+Reasonable+Decision%22+fried "An Unreasonable Reaction to a Reasonable Decision"] in ''Bush V. Gore: The Question of Legitimacy'', page 12 (Yale University Press, Bruce Ackerman ed. 2002): "The outrage against the stay by 673 law professors is, to say the least, overwrought. If the decision on the merits was justified, the stay becomes irrelevant. Yes, it did shut down the counting three and a half days earlier, but by hypothesis that counting was being done in an unconstitutional way."</ref>

Some critics argued that the Court's decision was a perversion of the Equal Protection Clause<ref name="bandits" /> and contrary to the [[political question]] doctrine.<ref>Tribe, Laurence H., "The Unbearable Wrongness of Bush v. Gore". George Mason Law & Economics Research Paper No. 03-33; Harvard Law School, Public Law Working Paper No. 72. Available at SSRN: https://ssrn.com/abstract=431080</ref> Scott Lemieux of University of Washington points out that if recounting votes without a uniform statewide standard were truly a violation of the Equal Protection Clause, this should have meant that the initial count, which also lacked a uniform standard, was itself unconstitutional.<ref name="how bad" /> On the other hand, [[Geoffrey R. Stone]] has expressed sympathy with the Court's equal protection reasoning, even though Stone was dismayed by what he saw as the sudden and suspect conversion of Justices Rehnquist, Scalia and Thomas to that equal protection principle. According to Stone:

{{quote|No one familiar with the jurisprudence of Justices Rehnquist, Scalia, and Thomas could possibly have imagined that they would vote to invalidate the Florida recount process on the basis of their own well-developed and oft-invoked approach to the Equal Protection Clause.<ref>{{cite web|title=Equal Protection?

Justice Stevens' criticism of the Court in his dissent for questioning the impartiality of Florida's judiciary was itself criticized by Lund, a former law clerk for Justice O'Connor.<ref name="nyt1989"/><ref name="rightness">{{cite journal| journal=Cardozo Law Review |volume=23 |issue=4|ssrn=267874|title=The Unbearable Rightness of ''Bush v. Gore''|page=1221|last=Lund|first=Nelson|date=April 26, 2001}}</ref><ref>The dissent by Justice Stevens in Bush v. Gore stated, "What must underlie petitioners' entire federal assault on the Florida election procedures is an unstated lack of confidence in the impartiality and capacity of the state judges who would make the critical decisions if the vote count were to proceed. Otherwise, their position is wholly without merit. The endorsement of that position by the majority of this Court can only lend credence to the most cynical appraisal of the work of judges throughout the land. It is confidence in the men and women who administer the judicial system that is the true backbone of the rule of law. Time will one day heal the wound to that confidence that will be inflicted by today's decision. One thing, however, is certain. Although we may never know with complete certainty the identity of the winner of this year's Presidential election, the identity of the loser is perfectly clear. It is the Nation's confidence in the judge as an impartial guardian of the rule of law."</ref> Professor Charles Zelden faults the ''per curiam'' opinion in the case for, among other things, not declaring that the nation's electoral system required significant reform, and for not condemning administration of elections by part-time boards of elections dominated by partisan and unprofessional officials. Zelden concludes that the Court's failure to spotlight this critical flaw in American electoral democracy made a replay of ''Bush v. Gore'' more likely, not less likely, either in Florida or elsewhere.<ref name="Zelden" /> In 2013, retired Justice O'Connor, who had voted with the majority, said that the case "gave the court a less-than-perfect reputation". She added, "Maybe the court should have said, 'We're not going to take it, goodbye.' ... And probably the Supreme Court added to the problem at the end of the day."<ref name="tribune">{{cite news |url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/ct-met-sandra-day-oconnor-edit-board-20130427,0,1201477.story |work=Chicago Tribune |title=O'Connor questions court's decision to take Bush v.

A subsequent article in ''Vanity Fair'' quotes several of the court's clerks at the time who were critical of the decision. They note that, despite the per curiam decision's declaration that the case was taken "reluctantly", Justice Kennedy had been rather enthusiastic about taking the case all along.<ref name="Vanity" /> They felt at the time, as had many legal scholars, that the case was unlikely to go to the Supreme Court at all. In fact some of the justices were so certain that the case would never come before them that they had already left for vacations.

==Public reaction==
Editorials in the country's leading newspapers were overwhelmingly critical of the decision. A review by ''The Georgetown Law Journal'' found that the nation's top newspapers, by circulation, had published 18 editorials criticizing the decision, compared with just 6 praising it. They similarly published 26 [[Op-ed|op-eds]] criticizing the decision, compared to just 8 defending the decision.<ref name="auto2"/> Polls showed a range of reactions, with 37–65% of respondents believing that personal politics influenced the decision of the justices, depending on the poll. A Princeton Survey poll recorded 46% of respondents saying that the decision made them more likely to suspect the partisan bias of the judges in general. An NBC News/''Wall Street Journal'' poll showed that 53% of respondents believed that the decision to stop the recount was based mostly on politics.<ref name="auto2" /> A 2010 article in ''Slate'' listed the case as the first in a series of events that eroded American trust in the results of elections, noting that the number of lawsuits brought over election issues has more than doubled since ''Bush v. Gore''.<ref name="auto1" />
