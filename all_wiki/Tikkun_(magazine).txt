'''''Tikkun''''' is a quarterly [[interfaith]] Jewish [[Left-wing politics|left]]-[[Progressivism|progressive]] magazine and website, published in the [[United States]], that analyzes [[Culture of the United States|American]] and [[Israeli culture]], politics, religion, and history in the [[English language]]. The magazine has consistently published the work of [[Israelis|Israeli]] and [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] left-wing intellectuals, but also included book and music reviews, personal essays, and poetry. In 2006 and 2011, the magazine was awarded the ''Independent Press Award for Best Spiritual Coverage'' by ''[[Utne Reader]]''<ref>{{cite journal|title= Spiritual Coverage: Tikkun |journal=Utne Reader|date= January–February 2007 |accessdate=March 4, 2016|url= http://www.utne.com/issues/2006_139/features/12371-1.html |url-status= dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080907065256/http://www.utne.com/issues/2006_139/features/12371-1.html |archivedate=September 7, 2008|quote= In November, Rabbi Michael Lerner's erudite rejoinder to the religious right released ''Tikkun Reader: Twentieth Anniversary'' (Rowman & Littlefield) to showcase memorable essays from the bimonthly magazine's all-star cast of contributors}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title= Winners of the 2011 Utne Independent Press Awards |journal=Utne Reader|date= April 12, 2011 |accessdate=March 4, 2016|url= http://www.utne.com/Utne-Independent-Press-Award-Winners-2011.aspx|quote= Illuminated by the Jewish faith but accessible to all, Tikkun aims to 'mend, repair and transform the world'}}</ref> for its analysis of the inability of many progressives to understand people's yearning for faith, and the American [[fundamentalist]]s' political influence on the international conflict among religious [[zealots]].

Since 2012, its publisher is [[Duke University Press]]. [[Beyt Tikkun]] [[Synagogue]], led by Rabbi Michael Lerner, is loosely affiliated with Tikkun magazine. It describes itself as a "[[Halakha|hallachic]] community bound by Jewish law".<ref name=Founding>{{cite web|url=http://www.beyttikkun.org/fmd/files/FoundingPerspective.pdf|title=Founding Perspective|work=Beyt Tikkun|accessdate=February 6, 2008|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20081002001335/http://beyttikkun.org/fmd/files/foundingperspective.pdf|archivedate=October 2, 2008|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

==Origin and meaning of the name==
The magazine's title comes from mystical Hebrew concept ''[[Tikkun Olam|tikkun olam]]'' ({{lang-he|'''תיקון עולם'''}}; "healing or restoring the world"), emphasizing both humanity's and God's co-responsibility "to heal, repair and transform the world".

In her book, ''[[If I Am Not For Myself: The Liberal Betrayal of the Jews]]'',  [[Ruth Wisse]] argues that ''Tikkun'' is one of a group of left-of-center Jewish organizations and publications founded in the 1980s without explaining why a new, Jewish was needed to cover issues already covered by such existing publications as [[Dissent (American magazine)|Dissent]]. Wisse argues that the actual motivation was a need felt by highly educated Jews to counter rising antisemitism on the left by means of "public avowals of kindliness and liberalism."<ref name="Wisse">{{cite book |last1=Wisse |first1=Ruth |title=If I Am Not For Myself: The Liberal Betrayal of the Jews, pp. 29 ff. |date=1992 |publisher=Free Press}}</ref>

==Publisher==
Initially, Nan Fink Gefen, at the time married to Lerner, devoted financial resources and served as a hands-on publisher until she left as their marriage ended in 1991.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} In 1997 a fellow 1960s-activist Danny Goldberg, a major music industry figure heavily involved in the [[ACLU]], became co-publisher with his father, Victor. During these years, prominent journalists such as [[Jack Newfield]] interviewed national and international leaders such as Mario Cuomo and Haiti's embattled President [[Aristide]] to bring more credibility to the growing influence of the magazine. From 2002 through 2011, Lerner's sister, [[Trish Vradenburg]], and her husband served as co-publishers.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

==Editorial policy==
Founded in 1986, the magazine's editorial policy was shaped by Nan Fink Gefen, Michael Lerner, and [[Peter Gabel]]. According to the founding editorial statement,<ref>{{cite book|title=Tikkun 5 Year Anthology edited by Michael Lerner|publisher=Tikkun Books|year=1992|isbn=978-0935933031|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/tikkuntohealrepa00mich}}</ref> political concerns of the 1960s civil rights, anti-war, and feminist movements and psychological studies of workers in the 1970s and 1980s were their most direct influences. Among authors who contributed to the magazine's interfaith character were the historian [[Christopher Lasch]], philosopher [[Cornel West]], and [[Harvey Cox]] of Harvard Divinity School.

Obliquely confronting more conservative American Jewish community's [[Commentary Magazine]], which caused some members of the Editorial Board, including [[Elie Wiesel]], to resign,{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} the magazine introduced itself with prominent ads placed in leading intellectual papers and journals declaring a new voice for the Jewish Left. Rabbi [[Abraham Joshua Heschel]]'s legacy of "prophetic" Jewish activism has been honored and analyzed from the first issue onward. In every issue, it is stated that its articles "do not necessarily reflect ''Tikkun's'' position on any issue",<ref>{{cite news|title=Disclaimer|publisher=Tikkun|page=4}}</ref> and its editor, Rabbi Michael Lerner, has written that he "often consciously seeks to print articles with which he disagrees".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tikkun.org/rabbi_lerner/ask_the_rabbi_form|title=Ask the Rabbi|accessdate=February 7, 2007|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061231025743/http://www.tikkun.org/rabbi_lerner/ask_the_rabbi_form|archivedate=December 31, 2006|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

==''Network of Spiritual Progressives''==
In 2001 the magazine's interfaith activist community's website, the ''[[Network of Spiritual Progressives]]'', initially named differently, was established by founders that include ''Sister'' Joan Chittister, a [[Benedictine]] nun, and [[Cornel West]], a Princeton University professor of religion, in order to engage readers in broader activism and broaden the magazine's appeal to non-Jewish readers.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} Challenging the anti-religious and anti-spiritual biases within liberal culture and "replacing world domination with generosity" are among the ideas that are supported by the community.

==Controversy==
===Accusations of Anti-Semitism===
In 2005 [[Manfred Gerstenfeld]] cited an article published by ''Tikkun'' &mdash; [[Joel Kovel]]’s "On Left Anti-Semitism and the Special Status of Israel" (May/June 2003) &mdash; as one of two examples of "essays of Jewish authors using anti-Semitic arguments".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jcpa.org/phas/phas-30.htm |title=Jews against Israel |first=Manfred |last=Gerstenfeld |publisher=Post-Holocaust and Anti-Semitism |date=March 1, 2005 |accessdate=February 7, 2007}}</ref> In his article, Kovel described Israel as a racist state that "automatically generates crimes against humanity and lacks the internal means of correcting them", adding that such a state "cannot have that legitimacy which gives it the right to exist".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zmag.org/content/showarticle.cfm?ItemID=3597|title=On Left anti-Semitism and the Special Status of Israel|author=Joel Kovel|work=Tikkun|date=May–June 2003|accessdate=February 7, 2007|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929130547/http://www.zmag.org/content/showarticle.cfm?ItemID=3597|archivedate=September 29, 2007|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

In a 2006 column, [[Alan Dershowitz]] wrote that "''Tikkun'' is quickly becoming the most virulently anti-Israel screed ever published under Jewish auspices" and that "support for ''Tikkun'' is support for the enemies of Israel".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishsf.com/content/2-0-/module/displaystory/story_id/30647/edition_id/575/format/html/displaystory.html|title=The accusation: 'Moral pervert' hit piece shouldn't have been spread|author=Alan Dershowitz|work=The Jewish News Weekly of Northern California|date=October 20, 2006|accessdate=February 7, 2007}}</ref> Dershowitz and his books have been the targets of criticism in the pages of ''Tikkun'' (for example: May/June 1997, September/October 1997, November/December 1997, January/February 1999).

===Improprieties regarding Letters to the editor===
In 1997 former ''Tikkun'' editors accused Lerner of publishing pseudonymous letters to the editor that he himself had written. While many of the letters were laudatory ("Your editorial stand on Iraq said publicly what many of us in the Israeli peace camp are feeling privately but dare not say."), a few were critical ("Have you gone off your rocker?"). Lerner admitted that he had written the letters but said his only mistake was not informing readers that the authors' names were pseudonyms.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jewishsf.com/content/2-0-/module/displaystory/story_id/5763/edition_id/107/formathtml/displaystory.html |title=Tikkun editor calls letter-writing policy 'a mistake' |date=March 21, 1997|author=Leslie Katz|work=Jewish News Weekly of Northern California|accessdate=September 30, 2010}}</ref>
