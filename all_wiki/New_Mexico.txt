'''New Mexico''' ({{lang-es|Nuevo México}} {{IPA-es|ˈnweβo ˈmexiko||Nuevo México.ogg}}; {{lang-nv|Yootó Hahoodzo}} {{IPA-nv|joː˩tʰo˥ ha˩hoː˩tso˩|}}) is a [[U.S. state|state]] in the [[Southwestern United States|Southwestern region]] of the [[United States|United States of America]]; its capital is [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]], which was founded in 1610 as capital of [[Santa Fe de Nuevo México|Nuevo México]] (itself established as a province of [[New Spain]] in 1598), while its largest city is [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]] with its accompanying [[Albuquerque metropolitan area|metropolitan area]]. It is one of the [[Mountain States]] and shares the [[Four Corners]] region with [[Utah]], [[Colorado]], and [[Arizona]]. New Mexico is also bordered by the state of [[Texas]] to the east-southeast, [[Oklahoma]] to the northeast, and the [[List of states of Mexico|Mexican states]] of [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]] to the south and [[Sonora]] to the southwest. With an estimated population of 2,096,829 as of the July 1, 2019, U.S. Census Bureau estimate, New Mexico is the 36th [[List of U.S. states and territories by population|largest state by population]]. With a total area of {{convert|121590|sqmi|km2|abbr=on}}, it is the [[List of U.S. states and territories by area|fifth-largest]] and [[List of U.S. states and territories by population density|sixth-least densely populated]] of the 50 states. Due to their geographic locations, [[Northern New Mexico|northern]] and [[eastern New Mexico]] exhibit a colder, [[alpine climate]], while western and southern New Mexico exhibit a warmer, [[Desert climate|arid climate]].

The [[economy of New Mexico]] is dependent on [[Oil well|oil drilling]], [[Mining|mineral extraction]], [[dryland farming]], [[Ranch|cattle ranching]], [[acequia]] and [[landrace]] [[agriculture]], [[lumber]] milling, [[retail]] trade, [[science|scientific]] [[research]] [[laboratories]], [[high technology|technological development]], as well as [[the arts]] especially [[Textile arts|textile]]s and [[visual arts]]. As of 2018, its total gross domestic product (GDP) was $101{{nbs}}billion<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.bea.gov/system/files/2019-04/qgdpstate0519_4.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=May 1, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190501132003/https://www.bea.gov/system/files/2019-04/qgdpstate0519_4.pdf |archive-date=May 1, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> with a GDP per capita of $45,465. [[Taxation in New Mexico|State tax policy]] results in low to moderate taxation of resident personal income compared to most U.S. states, with special consideration for military personnel, and gives tax credits and exemptions to favorable industries. Because of this, [[:Category:Films shot in New Mexico|its film industry]] has grown and contributed $1.23{{nbs}}billion to its overall economy. Due to its large area and economic climate, New Mexico has a large [[United States Armed Forces|U.S. military]] presence marked notably with the [[White Sands Missile Range]]. Various U.S. [[National Security Agency|national security]] agencies base their research and testing arms in New Mexico, such as the [[Sandia National Laboratories|Sandia]] and [[Los Alamos National Laboratory|Los Alamos National Laboratories]]. During the 1940s, [[Project Y]] of the [[Manhattan Project]] developed and built the country's first [[Nuclear weapon|atomic bomb]] and nuclear test, [[Trinity (nuclear test)|Trinity]].

Inhabited by [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] for many thousands of years before [[Exploration of North America|European exploration]], it was colonized by the Spanish in 1598 as part of the [[Spanish Empire|Imperial Spanish]] [[viceroy]]alty of [[New Spain]]. In 1563, it was named [[Santa Fe de Nuevo México|Nuevo México]] after the Aztec [[Valley of Mexico]] by Spanish settlers, more than 250 years before the establishment and naming of the present-day country of [[Mexico]]; thus, the present-day state of New Mexico<!-- DO NOT CHANGE.

This autonomy was threatened, however, by the centralizing tendencies of the Mexican government from the 1830s onward, with rising tensions eventually leading to the [[Revolt of 1837 (New Mexico)|Revolt of 1837]]. At the same time, the region became more economically dependent on the United States. At the conclusion of the [[Mexican–American War]] in 1848, the United States annexed New Mexico as the U.S. [[New Mexico Territory]]. It was [[Admission to the Union|admitted to the Union]] as the 47th state on January 6, 1912.

Its history has given New Mexico the highest percentage of [[Hispanic and Latino Americans]], and the second-highest percentage of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] as a population proportion (after [[Alaska]]).<ref name="demo">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/briefs/c2010br-10.pdf|title=The American Indian and Alaska Native Population: 2010|last1=Norris|first=Tina|last2=Vines|first2=Paula L.|date=February 2012|website=Census 2010 Brief|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|access-date=May 1, 2012|last3=Hoeffel|first3=Elizabeth M.|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120505221036/http://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/briefs/c2010br-10.pdf|archive-date=May 5, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> New Mexico is home to part of the [[Navajo Nation]], 19 federally recognized [[Pueblo|Pueblo communities]] of [[Puebloan peoples]], and three different federally recognized [[Apache]] tribes.

==Etymology==

New Mexico received its name long before the present-day nation of [[Mexico]] won independence from Spain and adopted that name in 1821. Though the name "Mexico" itself derives from [[Nahuatl]], and in that language it originally referred to the heartland of the Empire of the Mexicas ([[Aztec Empire]]) in the [[Valley of Mexico]] far from the area of New Mexico, Spanish explorers also used the term "Mexico" to name the region of New Mexico (''{{lang|es|Nuevo México}}'' in Spanish) in 1563. In 1581, the [[Chamuscado and Rodríguez Expedition]] named the region north of the Rio Grande "San Felipe del Nuevo México".<ref>{{cite book |first=David J. |last=Weber |title=The Spanish Frontier in North America |publisher=Yale University Press |location=[[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]] and [[London]] |year=1992 |page=79 }}</ref> The Spaniards had hoped to find wealthy indigenous Mexica (Aztec) cultures there similar to those of the [[Aztec Empire|Aztec (Mexica) Empire]] of the Valley of Mexico. The indigenous cultures of New Mexico, however, proved to be unrelated to the [[Mexicas]], and they were not wealthy,<ref>{{cite book |first=Joseph P. |last=Sanchez |title=The Rio Abajo Frontier, 1540–1692: A History of Early Colonial New Mexico |location=Albuquerque |publisher=Museum of Albuquerque History Monograph Series |year=1987 |page=51 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Names on the Land: A Historical Account of Place-Naming in the United States |last=Stewart |first=George |author-link=George R.

In 1563, he went far to the north{{nbs}}... when he returned south, Ibarra boasted that he had discovered a New Mexico. Doubtless, like others, he stretched the tale, and certainly the land of which he told was well south of the one now so called. Yet, men remembered the name ''Nuevo México'', though not at first, as that of the region which Coronado had once conquered. }}</ref> but the name persisted. Before statehood, the name "New Mexico" applied to various configurations of a former U.S. [[New Mexico Territory]] and, even prior to its former Mexican territorial status, a former provincial kingdom of [[New Spain]] called [[Santa Fe de Nuevo México|Nuevo México]], all in the same general area, but of varying extensions.<ref>Rivera, José A., ''Acequia Culture: Water, Land, and Community in the Southwest'', University of New Mexico Press, 1998.</ref>

===Climate===

[[File:New Mexico Köppen.svg|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Köppen climate classification|Köppen climate types]] of New Mexico]]

New Mexico's climate is generally semiarid to arid, though areas of continental and alpine climates exist, and its territory is mostly covered by mountains, high plains, and desert. The [[Great Plains]] (High Plains) are in [[eastern New Mexico]], similar to the Colorado high plains in eastern Colorado. The two states share similar terrain, with both having plains, mountains, basins, mesas, and desert lands. New Mexico's statewide average precipitation is {{convert|13.9|in|mm}} a year, with average monthly amounts peaking in the summer, as at Albuquerque, and [[Las Cruces, New Mexico|Las Cruces]] in the south. The average annual temperatures can range from {{convert|64|°F|°C}} in the southeast to below {{convert|40|°F|°C}} in the northern mountains.<ref name="NMSUclimate" /> During the summer, daytime temperatures can often exceed {{convert|100|°F|°C}} at elevations below {{convert|5000|ft|m}}, the average high temperature in July ranges from {{convert|97|°F|°C}} at the lower elevations down to 78{{nbs}}°F (26{{nbs}}°C) at the higher elevations. In the colder months of November to March, many cities in New Mexico can have nighttime temperature lows in the teens above zero, or lower. The highest temperature recorded in New Mexico was {{convert|122|°F|°C}} at the [[Waste Isolation Pilot Plant|Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP)]] near [[Loving, New Mexico|Loving]] on June 27, 1994, and the lowest recorded temperature is {{convert|-50|°F|°C}} at [[Gavilan, New Mexico|Gavilan]] (near [[Lindrith, New Mexico|Lindrith]]) on February 1, 1951.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/extremes/scec/getextreme.php?forwhat=st&elem=ALL&state=NM |title=All-Time Climate Extremes for NM |access-date=March 18, 2011 |publisher=National Climatic Data Center |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528175146/http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/extremes/scec/getextreme.php?forwhat=st&elem=ALL&state=NM |archive-date=May 28, 2010 }}</ref>

===Flora and fauna===

[[File:Geococcyx californianus.jpg|thumb|[[Greater roadrunner]] (the state bird of New Mexico)]]

New Mexico has five unique floristic zones, providing diverse sets of habitats for many plants and animals. The [[Llano Estacado]] (or [[Shortgrass Prairie]]) in the eastern part of the state is characterized by sod-forming short grasses such as [[Bouteloua gracilis|blue grama]], and it used to sustain [[American bison|bison]]. The [[Chihuahuan Desert]] extends through the south of the state and is characterized by shrubby [[Larrea tridentata|creosote]]. The [[Colorado Plateau]] in the northwest corner of New Mexico is high desert with cold winters, and is characterized by [[Artemisia tridentata|sagebrush]], [[Atriplex confertifolia|shadescale]], [[Sarcobatus|greasewood]], and other plants adapted to the [[Soil salinity|saline]] and seleniferous soil. The mountainous [[Mogollon Plateau]] in the west-central of the state and southern [[Rocky Mountains]] in the north-central, have a wide range in elevation ({{convert|4000|to|13000|ft|sigfig=2|disp=or|abbr=on}}), with vegetation types corresponding to elevation gradients, such as [[Pinyon-juniper woodland|piñon-juniper woodlands]] near the base, through [[evergreen]] [[Pinophyta|conifers]], [[spruce]]-[[fir]] and [[aspen]] forests, [[Krummholz]], and [[alpine tundra]]. The [[Madrean Region|Apachian zone]] tucked into the southwestern bootheel of the state has high-calcium soil, [[Madrean pine-oak woodlands|oak woodlands]], and [[Cupressus arizonica|Arizona cypress]], and other plants that are not found in other parts of the state.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Lowrey|first1=Timothy K.|title=Flora of New Mexico: Biology 463|date=2017|publisher=University of New Mexico|pages=88–162}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Ivey |first1=Robert DeWitt |title=Flowering plants of New Mexico |date=2008 |publisher=RD & V Ivey |location=Albuquerque, NM |isbn=978-0-9612170-4-4 |edition=5th}}</ref>

[[File:Santa Fe of New Mexico (location map scheme).svg|thumb|Territory of [[Santa Fe de Nuevo México]] when it belonged to Mexico in 1824]]

As a part of New Spain, the claims for the province of New Mexico passed to independent Mexico in 1821 following the [[Mexican War of Independence]].<ref name="Simmons 1988" />{{Rp|109}} The [[Republic of Texas]] claimed the portion east of the [[Rio Grande]] when it seceded from Mexico in 1836, when it incorrectly assumed the older Hispanic settlements of the upper Rio Grande were the same as the newly established Mexican settlements of Texas. Texas's<!-- tech sizz izz --> only attempt to establish a presence or control in the claimed territory was the failed [[Texan Santa Fe Expedition]]. Their entire army was captured and jailed by Hispanic New Mexico militia.

At the turn of the 19th century, the extreme northeastern part of New Mexico, north of the Canadian River and east of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains, was still claimed by France, which sold it in 1803 as part of the [[Louisiana Purchase]]. When the [[Louisiana Territory]] was admitted as a state in 1812, the U.S. reclassified it as part of the [[Missouri Territory]]. The region (along with territory that makes up present-day southeastern Colorado, the [[Texas Panhandle|Texas]] and [[Oklahoma Panhandle]]s, and southwestern [[Kansas]]) was ceded to Spain under the [[Adams-Onis Treaty]] in 1819.

By 1800, the population of New Mexico had reached 25,000.<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/411812/New-Mexico New Mexico (state)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090930014044/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/411812/New-Mexico |date=September 30, 2009 }}.

Following the victory of the United States in the Mexican–American War (1846–48), under the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]] in 1848, Mexico ceded its northern holdings including the territories of California, Texas, and New Mexico, to the United States of America.<ref name="Simmons 1988" />{{Rp|132}} The United States vowed to accept the residents' claims to their lands and to accept them as full citizens with rights of suffrage.

After Texas was admitted as a state to the Union, it continued to claim a northeastern portion of New Mexico. It was forced by the US government to drop these claims, in the [[Compromise of 1850]], Texas ceded these claims to the United States of the area in New Mexico lying east of the Rio Grande, in exchange for $10{{nbs}}million from the federal government.<ref name="Simmons 1988" />{{Rp|135}}

New Mexico played a role in the [[Trans-Mississippi Theater of the American Civil War]]. Both [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] and [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] governments claimed ownership and territorial rights over New Mexico Territory. In 1861, the Confederacy claimed the southern tract as its own [[Arizona Territory (Confederate States of America)|Arizona Territory]] and waged the ambitious [[New Mexico Campaign]] in an attempt to control the [[American Southwest]] and open up access to Union California. Confederate power in the New Mexico Territory was effectively broken after the [[Battle of Glorieta Pass]] in 1862. However, the Confederate territorial government continued to operate out of Texas, and Confederate troops marched under the Arizona flag until the end of the war. Additionally, more than 8,000 men from New Mexico Territory served in the Union Army.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.civilwardata.com/dbstatus.html |title=American Civil War Research Database statistics |publisher=Civilwardata.com |date=March 4, 2012 |access-date=June 10, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120617052546/http://www.civilwardata.com/dbstatus.html |archive-date=June 17, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

In the late 19th century, the majority of officially European-descended residents in New Mexico were ethnic Mexicans, many of whom had deep roots in the area from early Spanish colonial times. Politically, they still controlled most of the town and county offices through area elections, and wealthy sheepherder families commanded considerable influence. The Anglo-Americans tended to have more ties to the territorial governor and judges, who were appointed by officials out of the region. The two groups struggled for power and the future of the territory. The Anglo minority was "outnumbered, but well-organized and growing".<ref name="montgomery">[https://www.jstor.org/stable/27502746?seq=2#page_scan_tab_contents Charles Montgomery, "Becoming 'Spanish-American': Race and Rhetoric in New Mexico Politics, 1880-1928"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161107003618/http://www.jstor.org/stable/27502746?seq=2#page_scan_tab_contents |date=November 7, 2016 }}, ''Journal of American Ethnic History'' Vol. 20, No. 4 (Summer, 2001), pp. 59-84 (published by University of Illinois Press for Immigration and Ethnic History Society); accessed via JSTOR, July 20, 2016</ref> Anglo-Americans made distinctions between the wealthy Mexicans and poor, ill-educated laborers.

Native Americans from New Mexico fought for the United States in both the [[World War I|First]] and Second World Wars. Veterans were disappointed to return and find their civil rights limited by state discrimination. In Arizona and New Mexico, veterans challenged state laws or practices prohibiting them from voting. In 1948, after veteran Miguel Trujillo, Sr. of [[Isleta Pueblo]] was told by the county registrar that he could not register to vote, he filed suit against the county in federal district court. A three-judge panel overturned as unconstitutional New Mexico's provisions that Indians who did not pay taxes (and could not document if they had paid taxes) could not vote.<ref name="suffrage"/> Judge Phillips wrote:
{{blockquote|Any other citizen, regardless of race, in the State of New Mexico who has not paid one cent of tax of any kind or character, if he possesses the other qualifications, may vote. An Indian, and only an Indian, in order to meet the qualifications to vote must have paid a tax. How you can escape the conclusion that makes a requirement with respect to an Indian as a qualification to exercise the elective franchise and does not make that requirement with respect to the member of any race is beyond me.<ref name="suffrage" />}}

New Mexico has received large amounts of federal government spending on major military and research institutions in the state. It is home to three Air Force bases, [[White Sands Missile Range]], and the federal research laboratories [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] and [[Sandia National Laboratories]]. The state's population grew rapidly after World War II, growing from 531,818 in 1940 to 1,819,046 in 2000.<ref name="1990 CPH2">{{cite book|title=Population and Housing Unit Counts |chapter-url=http://2010.census.gov/2010census/data/apportionment-dens-text.php |chapter-format=PDF |access-date=July 3, 2008 |series=1990 Census of Population and Housing |volume=CPH-2-1 |publisher=U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census |pages=26–27 |chapter=Table 16.

In the late 20th century, Native Americans were authorized by federal law to establish gaming casinos on their reservations under certain conditions, in states which had authorized such gaming. Such facilities have helped tribes close to population centers to generate revenues for reinvestment in economic development and welfare of their peoples.

In the 21st century, employment growth areas in New Mexico include [[electronic circuit]]ry, [[scientific research]], [[call center]]s, and [[Indian casino]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bber.unm.edu/pubs/WRSA.pdf |title=The Southwest Heartland: The Good, the Bad & the Ugly |access-date=October 12, 2008 |last=Reynis |first=Lee A. |author2=Marshall J.

===Population===

The [[United States Census Bureau]] estimates that the population of New Mexico was 2,096,829 on July 1, 2019, a 1.83% increase since the [[2010 United States Census|2010]] census.<ref name="PopEstUS"/> The [[2000 United States Census|2000]] census recorded the population of New Mexico to be 1,819,046; ten years later it was 2,059,179—an 11.7% increase.<ref name="bber.unm.edu">{{cite web|url=http://bber.unm.edu/new-mexico|title=New Mexico {{!}} Bureau of Business and Economic Research UNM|website=bber.unm.edu|access-date=February 28, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303072359/http://bber.unm.edu/new-mexico|archive-date=March 3, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>

Among U.S. states, New Mexico has the highest percentage of Hispanic ancestry, at 47% (as of July 1, 2012). This classification covers people of very different cultures and histories, including [[Spanish American|descendants]] of Spanish [[colonist]]s with deep roots in the region, and recent immigrants from a variety of nations in Latin America, each with their own cultures.

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]] Model-based Small Area Income and Poverty Estimates, the number of persons in poverty has increased to 400,779 (19.8% of the population) persons in 2010 from 2000. At that time, the estimated number of persons in poverty was recorded at 309,193 (17.3% of the population). The latest available data for 2014 estimate the number of persons in poverty at 420,388 (20.6% of the population).<ref name="bber.unm.edu"/>

Besides Navajo, which is also spoken in Arizona, a few other [[Indigenous languages of the Americas|Native American languages]] are spoken by smaller groups in New Mexico, most of which are only spoken in the state. Native New Mexican languages include [[Mescalero-Chiricahua language|Mescalero Apache]], [[Jicarilla language|Jicarilla Apache]], [[Tewa language|Tewa]], [[Southern Tiwa language|Southern Tiwa]], [[Northern Tiwa]], [[Jemez language|Towa]], [[Keres language|Keres]] (Eastern and Western), and [[Zuni language|Zuni]]. Mescalero and Jicarilla Apache are closely related [[Southern Athabaskan languages]], and both are also related to Navajo. Tewa, the Tiwa languages, and Towa belong to the [[Tanoan languages|Kiowa-Tanoan]] language family, and thus all descend from a [[Language family|common ancestor]]. Keres and Zuni are [[Language isolate|language isolates]], and have no relatives outside of New Mexico.

===Federal government===

[[File:Holloman AFB F-22.jpg|thumb|An [[F-22 Raptor]] flown by the [[49th Fighter Wing]] at [[Holloman AFB]]]]

Federal government spending is a major driver of the New Mexico economy. In 2005, the federal government spent $2.03 on New Mexico for every dollar of tax revenue collected from the state. This rate was higher than any other state in the Union. New Mexico is currently the second most dependent tax dollar state.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.taxfoundation.org/research/show/266.html |title=Federal Spending Received Per Dollar of Taxes Paid by State, 2005 |access-date=September 21, 2008 |publisher=Tax Foundation |date=October 9, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216005520/http://www.taxfoundation.org/research/show/266.html |archive-date=December 16, 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Many of the federal jobs relate to the military; the state hosts three air force bases ([[Kirtland Air Force Base]], [[Holloman Air Force Base]], and [[Cannon Air Force Base]]); a testing range ([[White Sands Missile Range]]); and an army proving ground ([[Fort Bliss]]'s McGregor Range). A May 2005 estimate by [[New Mexico State University]] is that 11.65% of the state's total employment arises directly or indirectly from military spending.<ref>

===Economic incentives===

[[File:Albuquerque Studios.jpg|thumb|Albuquerque Studios, built in 2007 for the rising demand of film production in the state]]

New Mexico provides a number of economic incentives to businesses operating in the state, including various types of [[tax credits]] and [[tax exemptions]]. Most of the incentives are based on job creation.<ref>

New Mexico imposes a [[Gross Receipts Tax]] (GRT) on many transactions, which may even include some governmental receipts. This resembles a [[sales tax]] but, unlike the sales taxes in many states, it applies to services as well as tangible goods. Normally, the provider or seller passes the tax on to the purchaser, however legal incidence and burden apply to the business, as an [[excise tax]]. GRT is imposed by [[New Mexico Taxation and Revenue Department|the state]] and there may an additional locality component to produce a total tax rate.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tax.state.nm.us/oos/GrossReceiptsTaxFAQ.pdf |title=Gross Receipts Taxes FAQ |access-date=October 9, 2008 |publisher=State of New Mexico, Taxation and Revenue Department |date=August 6, 2006 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070331014708/http://www.tax.state.nm.us/oos/GrossReceiptsTaxFAQ.pdf |archive-date=March 31, 2007 }}
</ref> As of July 1, 2013 the combined tax rate ranged from 5.125% to 8.6875%.<ref>[http://www.tax.newmexico.gov/Forms-and-Publications/Forms/Gross-Receipts/Pages/Home.aspx#Rates.aspx] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131024210432/http://www.tax.newmexico.gov/Forms-and-Publications/Forms/Gross-Receipts/Pages/Home.aspx#Rates.aspx|date=October 24, 2013}}</ref>

[[Property tax]] is imposed on [[real property]] by the state, by counties, and by school districts. In general, personal-use [[personal property]] is not subject to property taxation. On the other hand, property tax is levied on most business-use personal property. The taxable value of property is 1/3 of the assessed value. A tax rate of about 30 [[mill (currency)|mills]] is applied to the taxable value, resulting in an effective tax rate of about 1%. In the 2005 tax year, the average millage was about 26.47 for residential property, and 29.80 for non-residential property. Assessed values of residences cannot be increased by more than 3% per year unless the residence is remodeled or sold. Property tax deductions are available for military veterans and heads of household.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tax.state.nm.us/oos/PropertyTaxFAQ.pdf |title=Property Tax FAQ |access-date=October 9, 2008 |publisher=State of New Mexico, Taxation and Revenue Department |date=August 7, 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070331014658/http://www.tax.state.nm.us/oos/PropertyTaxFAQ.pdf |archive-date=March 31, 2007 }}

The pre-[[Christopher Columbus|Columbian]] trade with [[Mesoamerican cultures]] included northbound exotic birds, seashells and copper. Turquoise, pottery, and salt were some of the goods transported south along the [[Rio Grande]]. Present-day New Mexico's pre-Columbian trade is especially remarkable for being undertaken on foot. The north–south trade route later became a path for colonists with horses arriving from [[New Spain]] as well as trade and communication. The route was called ''[[El Camino Real de Tierra Adentro]]''.<ref name="Suina">{{cite web|url=http://www.newmexicohistory.org/story2.php?catid=727 |title=Indigenous trade |last=Suina |first=Kim |website=Digital History Project—Book of Migrations |publisher=New Mexico Office of the State Historian |access-date=March 31, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070903153033/http://www.newmexicohistory.org/story2.php?catid=727 |archive-date=September 3, 2007 }}</ref>

Another transcontinental railroad was completed by the [[Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway]]. The railroads essentially replaced the earlier trails but brought on a population boom. Early transcontinental [[auto trail]]s later crossed the state bringing more migrants. Railroads were later supplemented or replaced by a system of highways and airports. Today, New Mexico's [[Interstate Highway]]s approximate the earlier land routes of the Camino Real, the Santa Fe Trail and the transcontinental railroads.

===Interstate Highways===

New Mexico has only three [[List of Interstate Highways in New Mexico|Interstate Highways]]. In [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]], I-25 and I-40 meet at a stack interchange called [[Big I|The Big{{nbs}}I]].

[[Interstate 10 in New Mexico|Interstate 10]] travels in the southwest portion of New Mexico starting from the [[Arizona]] stateline near [[Lordsburg, New Mexico|Lordsburg]] to the area in between [[Las Cruces, New Mexico|Las Cruces]] and [[Anthony, New Mexico|Anthony]], near [[El Paso, Texas]].

[[Interstate 25 in New Mexico|Interstate 25]] is a major north–south interstate highway starting from Las Cruces to the [[Colorado]] stateline near [[Raton, New Mexico|Raton]].

[[Interstate 40 in New Mexico|Interstate 40]] is a major east–west interstate highway starting from the Arizona stateline west of [[Gallup, New Mexico|Gallup]] to the Texas stateline east from [[Tucumcari, New Mexico|Tucumcari]].

===U.S. Highways===

New Mexico currently has 15 [[List of U.S. Routes in New Mexico|United States Highways]]. This includes [[U.S. Route 54|US 54]], [[U.S. Route 56|US 56]], [[U.S. Route 60|US 60]], [[U.S. Route 62|US 62]], [[U.S. Route 64|US 64]], [[U.S. Route 70|US 70]], [[U.S. Route 82|US 82]], [[U.S. Route 84|US 84]], [[U.S. Route 87|US 87]], [[U.S. Route 160|US 160]], [[U.S. Route 180|US 180]], [[U.S. Route 285|US 285]], [[U.S. Route 380|US 380]], [[U.S. Route 491|US 491]], and [[U.S. Route 550|US 550]].

[[U.S. Route 66|US 66]], The Mother Road, was replaced by I-40 in 1985. [[U.S. Route 85|US 85]] is currently unsigned by the [[New Mexico Department of Transportation|NMDOT]], but the [[American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials|AASHTO]] still recognize it. It runs in the same trace with I-10 and I-25. US 666, The Devils Highway, was replaced by US 491 in 2003 because the number "[[666 (number)|666]]" is the "Number of the Beast".

===Government===

{{Main|Government of New Mexico}}

The [[Constitution of New Mexico]] established New Mexico's governmental structure. The executive branch of government is fragmented as outlined in the state constitution. The executive is composed of the [[Governor of New Mexico|governor]] and other statewide elected officials including the [[Lieutenant Governor of New Mexico|lieutenant governor]] (elected on the same ticket as the governor), [[Attorney General of New Mexico|attorney general]], [[Secretary of State of New Mexico|secretary of state]], [[New Mexico State Auditor|state auditor]], [[New Mexico State Treasurer|state treasurer]], and [[New Mexico Commissioner of Public Lands|commissioner of public lands]]. The governor appoints a cabinet who lead agencies statutorily designated under their jurisdiction. The [[New Mexico Legislature]] consists of the [[New Mexico House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] and [[New Mexico Senate|Senate]]. The judiciary is composed of the [[New Mexico Supreme Court]] and lower courts. There is also local government, consisting of counties, municipalities and special districts.<ref>{{cite web |title=New Mexico Government |url=http://www.newmexico.gov/government/ |website=www.newmexico.gov |access-date=1 January 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190102050440/http://www.newmexico.gov/government/ |archive-date=January 2, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Currently, both chambers of the [[New Mexico State Legislature]] have Democratic majorities. There are 26 Democrats and 16 Republicans in the Senate, and 47 Democrats and 23 Republicans in the House of Representatives.

New Mexico's members of the [[United States Senate]] are Democrats [[Martin Heinrich]] and [[Tom Udall]]. Democrats represent the state's three [[United States House of Representatives]] congressional districts with [[Deb Haaland]], [[Xochitl Torres Small]], and [[Ben Ray Luján]] representing the first, second, and third districts respectively.<ref>{{cite web |title=NM Federal Representatives |url=http://www.newmexico.gov/government/representatives.aspx |website=www.newmexico.gov |access-date=2 January 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190102095116/http://www.newmexico.gov/government/representatives.aspx |archive-date=January 2, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=New Mexico Senators, Representatives, and Congressional District Maps |url=https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/NM |website=GovTrack.us |access-date=2 January 2019 |language=en |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190102094806/https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/NM |archive-date=January 2, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> See [[List of United States congressional districts#New Mexico|New Mexico congressional map]].

New Mexico has traditionally been considered a [[swing state]], whose population has favored both [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] and [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] presidential candidates, but it has become more of a Democratic stronghold beginning with the [[2008 United States presidential election|presidential election of 2008]]. The governor is [[Michelle Lujan Grisham]] (D), who succeeded [[Susana Martinez]] (R) on January 1, 2019 after she served two terms as governor from 2011 to 2019. [[Gary Johnson]] served as governor from 1995 to 2003. Johnson served as a Republican, but in [[2012 United States presidential election|2012]] and [[2016 United States presidential election|2016]], he ran for president from the [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]]. In previous presidential elections, [[Al Gore]] carried the state (by 366 votes) in [[2000 United States presidential election|2000]]; [[George W. Bush]] won New Mexico's five electoral votes in [[2004 United States presidential election|2004]], and the state's electoral votes were won by [[Barack Obama]] and [[Hillary Clinton]] in [[2008 United States presidential election|2008]], 2012, and 2016. Since achieving statehood in [[1912 United States presidential election|1912]], New Mexico has been carried by the national popular vote victor in every presidential election of the past 104 years, except [[1976 United States presidential election|1976]], when [[Gerald Ford]] won the state by 2%, but lost the national popular vote by 2%.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.270towin.com/states/new+mexico |title=New Mexico Presidential Election Voting History |publisher=270towin.com |access-date=April 21, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140304183212/http://www.270towin.com/states/new+mexico |archive-date=March 4, 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref> It has also awarded its electoral votes to the candidate who would ultimately win, with the exception of [[1976 United States presidential election in New Mexico|1976]], [[2000 United States presidential election in New Mexico|2000]], and [[2016 United States presidential election in New Mexico|2016]].

Democrats in the state are usually strongest in the [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe Area]], various areas of the [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque Metro Area]] (such as the southeast and central areas, including the affluent Nob Hill neighborhood and the vicinity of the [[University of New Mexico]]), Northern and West Central New Mexico, and most of the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] reservations, particularly the [[Navajo Nation]]. Republicans have traditionally had their strongholds in the eastern and southern parts of the state, the [[Farmington, New Mexico|Farmington]] area, [[Rio Rancho, New Mexico|Rio Rancho]], and the newly developed areas in the Northwest mesa. Albuquerque's Northeast Heights have historically leaned Republican, but have become a key swing area for Democrats in recent election cycles. While registered Democrats outnumber registered Republicans by nearly 200,000, New Mexico voters have favored moderate to conservative candidates of both parties at the state and federal levels.

New Mexico abolished its death penalty statute, though not retroactively, effective July 1, 2009. This means individuals on New Mexico's Death Row can still be executed. On March 18, 2009, then Governor [[Bill Richardson]] signed the law abolishing the death penalty in New Mexico following the assembly and senate vote the week before, thus becoming the 15th U.S. state to abolish the penalty.<ref>Le Nouveau-Mexique abolit la peine de mort [archive] in Le Monde of March 19, 2009</ref>

On [[gun control]], New Mexico arguably has some of the least restrictive firearms laws in the country. State law pre-empts all local gun control ordinances. New Mexico residents may purchase any firearm deemed legal under federal law. There are no waiting periods under state law for picking up a firearm after it has been purchased, and there are no restrictions on magazine capacity. Additionally, New Mexico is a "shall-issue" state for [[concealed carry]] permits.

Before December 2013, New Mexico law neither explicitly allowed nor prohibited [[Same-sex marriage in the United States|same-sex marriage]]. Policy concerning the issuance of marriage licenses to same-sex couples was determined at the county level; that is, some county clerks issued marriage licenses to same-sex couples while others did not. In December 2013, the [[New Mexico Supreme Court]] issued a unanimous ruling directing all county clerks to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples, thereby making New Mexico the 17th state to recognize same-sex marriage at the statewide level.

With a Native American population of 134,000 in 1990,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/2002pubs/c2kbr01-15.pdf|title=The American Indian and Alaska Native Population: 2000|access-date=January 26, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130120194313/http://www.census.gov/prod/2002pubs/c2kbr01-15.pdf|archive-date=January 20, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> New Mexico ranks as an important center of Native American culture. Both the [[Navajo Nation|Navajo]] and [[Apache Tribe|Apache]] share [[Athabaskan]] origin. The Apache and some [[Ute Tribe|Ute]] live on federal [[Native American reservation|reservations]] within the state. With 16 million acres (6,500,000{{nbs}}[[hectare|ha]]), mostly in neighboring [[Arizona]], the reservation of the [[Navajo Nation]] ranks as the largest in the United States. The prehistorically agricultural [[Pueblo Indians]] live in pueblos scattered throughout the state. Almost half of New Mexicans claim Hispanic origin; many are descendants of colonial settlers called [[Hispanos of New Mexico|Hispanos or Neomexicanos]]. They settled in the state's northern portion. Most of the Mexican immigrants reside in the southern part of the state. Also 10-15% of the population, mainly in the north, may contain [[Who is a Jew?#New Mexico's Crypto-Jews|Hispanic Jewish ancestry]].{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

Many New Mexicans speak a unique dialect of Spanish. Because of the historical isolation of New Mexico from other speakers of the Spanish language, some of the vocabulary of [[New Mexican Spanish]] is unknown to other Spanish speakers. It uses numerous Native American words for local features and includes anglicized words that express American concepts and modern inventions.

Albuquerque has the [[New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science]], the [[National Hispanic Cultural Center]], and the [[National Museum of Nuclear Science & History]], as well as hosts the famed annual [[Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta]] every fall.

===Art and literature===

The earliest New Mexico artists whose work survives today are the Mimbres Indians, whose black and white pottery could be mistaken for modern art, except for the fact that it was produced before 1130 CE. See [[Mimbres culture]]. Many examples of this work can be seen at the [[Deming Armory|Deming Luna Mimbres Museum]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lunacountyhistoricalsociety.com/ |title=Deming Luna County Museum |publisher=Lunacountyhistoricalsociety.com |access-date=April 21, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407100414/http://www.lunacountyhistoricalsociety.com/ |archive-date=April 7, 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref> and at the [[Western New Mexico University]] Museum.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wnmumuseum.org/ |title=Western New Mexico University Museum |publisher=Wnmumuseum.org |access-date=April 21, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140209164438/http://www.wnmumuseum.org/ |archive-date=February 9, 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref>

A large artistic community thrives in [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]], and has included such people as [[Bruce Nauman]], [[Richard Tuttle]], [[John Connell]] and [[Steina Vasulka]]. The capital city has several art museums, including the [[New Mexico Museum of Art]], Museum of Spanish Colonial Art, [[Museum of International Folk Art]], [[Museum of Indian Arts and Culture]], [[Museum of Contemporary Native Art]]s, [[SITE Santa Fe]] and others. Colonies for artists and writers thrive, and the small city teems with art galleries. In August, the city hosts the annual [[Santa Fe Indian Market]], which is the oldest and largest juried Native American art showcase in the world. Performing arts include the renowned [[Santa Fe Opera]] which presents five operas in repertory each July to August, the [[Santa Fe Chamber Music Festival]] held each summer, and the restored [[Lensic Theater]] a principal venue for many kinds of performances. Santa Fe is also home to [[Frogville Records]], an indie record label. The weekend after Labor Day boasts the burning of [[Zozobra]], a fifty-foot (15{{nbs}}m) marionette, during [[Fiestas de Santa Fe]].
[[File:Santa Fe Opera interior view from section 10.jpg|thumb|left|Interior of the Crosby Theater at the [[Santa Fe Opera]], viewed from the mezzanine]]

Art is also a frequent theme in [[Albuquerque]], New Mexico's largest city. The [[National Hispanic Cultural Center]] has held hundreds of performing arts events, art showcases, and other events related to Spanish culture in New Mexico and worldwide in the centerpiece Roy E Disney Center for the Performing Arts or in other venues at the 53 acre facility. New Mexico residents and visitors alike can enjoy performing art from around the world at Popejoy Hall on the campus of the University of New Mexico. Popejoy Hall hosts singers, dancers, Broadway shows, other types of acts, and Shakespeare.<ref>{{cite web|title=Popejoy Hall|url=http://www.popejoypresents.com|access-date=May 15, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120516111725/http://popejoypresents.com/|archive-date=May 16, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> Albuquerque also has the unique and memorable [[KiMo Theater]] built in 1927 in the [[Pueblo Revival Style architecture]].

New Mexico holds strong to its Spanish heritage. Old Spanish traditions such [[zarzuela]]s and [[flamenco]] are popular in New Mexico.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.zarzuela.net/ref/feat/newmexico.htm |title=Zarzuela in New Mexico |publisher=Zarzuela.net |access-date=June 10, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415012050/http://www.zarzuela.net/ref/feat/newmexico.htm |archive-date=April 15, 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>[http://www.newmexico.org/hispanic/experience/flamenco.php] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120307131437/http://www.newmexico.org/hispanic/experience/flamenco.php|date=March 7, 2012}}</ref> Flamenco dancer and native New Mexican [[María Benítez]] founded the Maria Benítez Institute for Spanish Arts "to present programs of the highest quality of the rich artistic heritage of Spain, as expressed through music, dance, visual arts, and other art forms". There is also the Festival Flamenco Internacional de Alburquerque held each year in which native Spanish and New Mexican flamenco dancers perform at the University of New Mexico.

In the mid-20th century there was a thriving [[Hispanos|Hispano]] school of literature and scholarship being produced in both English and Spanish. Among the more notable authors were: [[Angélico Chávez]], [[Adelina Otero-Warren|Nina Otero-Warren]], Fabiola Cabeza de Baca, Aurelio Espinosa, Cleofas Jaramillo, [[Juan Bautista Rael]], and [[Aurora Lucero-White Lea]]. As well, writer [[D. H. Lawrence]] lived near [[Taos, New Mexico|Taos]] in the 1920s, at the [[D. H. Lawrence Ranch]], where there is a shrine said to contain his ashes.

New Mexico's strong Spanish, Native American, and Wild West frontier motifs have provided material for many authors in the state, including internationally recognized [[Rudolfo Anaya]] and [[Tony Hillerman]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.genordell.com/travel/NMauthors.htm|title=New Mexico Authors Page|access-date=May 15, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120808202007/http://www.genordell.com/travel/NMauthors.htm|archive-date=August 8, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>

[[Silver City, New Mexico|Silver City]], in the southwestern mountains of the state, was originally a mining town, and at least one nearby mine still operates.

Aside from the aforementioned ''Wild Hogs'', other movies filmed in New Mexico include ''[[Sunshine Cleaning]]'' and ''[[Vampires (1998 film)|Vampires]]''.

No major league professional sports teams are based in New Mexico, but the [[Albuquerque Isotopes]] are a [[Pacific Coast League]] [[Triple-A (baseball)|Triple-A]] baseball affiliate of the [[MLB]] [[Colorado Rockies]]. New Mexico is home to several baseball teams of the [[Pecos League]]: the [[Roswell Invaders]], [[Ruidoso Osos]], [[Santa Fe Fuego]] and the [[White Sands Pupfish (baseball)|White Sands Pupfish]].

Another soccer team from that city, [[Albuquerque Sol FC]], plays in the fourth-tier [[USL League Two]].

Collegiate athletics in New Mexico involve various [[New Mexico Lobos]] and [[New Mexico State Aggies]] teams in many sports. For many years the two universities have had a rivalry often referred to as the "[[Rio Grande Rivalry]]" or the "Battle of [[Interstate 25 in New Mexico|I-25]]" in recognition of the campuses' both being located along that highway. [[NMSU]] also has a rivalry with the [[University of Texas at El Paso]] which is called "[[The Battle of I-10]]". The winner of the NMSU-UTEP football game receives the [[Silver Spade]] trophy.
