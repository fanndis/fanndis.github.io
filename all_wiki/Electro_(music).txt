Electroempire.com</ref> Records in the genre typically feature [[drum machine]]s and heavy electronic sounds, usually without vocals, although if vocals are present they are delivered in a deadpan manner, often through electronic distortion such as [[Vocoder#Musical applications|vocoding]] and [[Talkbox#Musical applications|talkboxing]]. This is the main distinction between electro and previously prominent genres such as [[disco]], in which the electronic sound was only part of the instrumentation. It also palpably deviates from its predecessor [[Boogie (genre)|boogie]] for being less vocal-oriented and more focused on electronic beats produced by drum machines.

Following the decline of [[disco]] music in the United States, electro emerged as a fusion of [[funk]]<ref name="Electro">{{cite web|title=Electro|website=[[Allmusic]]|url=http://www.allmusic.com/style/electro-ma0000002571|accessdate=2012-06-20}}</ref> and early hip-hop with principal influences from New York [[Boogie (genre)|boogie]], German and Japanese electronic pop music. The genre emerged with musicians [[Arthur Baker (musician)|Arthur Baker]], [[Afrika Bambaataa]], [[Warp 9]], and [[Hashim Music|Hashim]]. Seminal electro tracks included "[[Planet Rock (song)|Planet Rock]]" (1982) and "[[Nunk (song)|Nunk]]" (1982), both featuring its characteristic TR-808 drum beats.

The early 1980s were electro's mainstream peak. By the mid 1980s, the genre moved away from its electronic and funk influences, using harder edged beats and rock samples, exemplified by [[Run DMC]]. Electro became popular again in the late 1990s with artists such as [[Anthony Rother]] and DJs such as [[Dave Clarke (techno DJ)|Dave Clarke]].<ref name="ishkurOnElectro">{{Cite web

}}

From its inception, one of the defining characteristics of the electro sound was the use of [[drum machine]]s, particularly the [[Roland TR-808]], as the rhythmic basis of the track. As the genre evolved,  computers and sampling replaced drum machines in electronic music, and are now used by the majority of electro producers. It is important to note, that although the electro of the 1980s and contemporary electro ([[electronic dance music]]) both grew out of the dissolution of disco, they are now different genres.

Classic (1980s) electro drum patterns tend to be electronic emulations of [[breakbeat]]s (occasionally a [[four to the floor]] pattern is used as well), with a syncopated kick drum, and usually a snare or clap accenting the backbeat. The difference between electro drumbeats and breakbeats (or breaks) is that electro tends to be more mechanical, while breakbeats tend to have more of a human-like feel, like that of a live drummer.  The definition however is somewhat ambiguous in nature due to the various uses of the term.<ref>[http://www.electrofunkroots.co.uk/articles/what.html Electro-Funk : What Did It All Mean?]. Electrofunkroots.co.uk. Retrieved on 2011-07-18.</ref>

The [[Roland TR-808]] drum machine was released in 1980, defining early electro with its immediately recognizable sound. Staccato, percussive drumbeats tended to dominate electro, almost exclusively provided by the TR-808. As an inexpensive way of producing a drum sound, the TR-808 caught on quickly with the producers of early electro because of the ability of its [[bass drum]] to generate extreme low-frequencies.<ref name=Anysound>{{cite journal | title = Anysound | journal = Keyboard | volume = 14 | issue = 11 | page = 34 | year = 1988}}; as cited in {{cite book |author=Théberge, Paul |title=Any sound you can imagine: making music/consuming all counts of technology |publisher=Wesleyan University Press |location=Middletown, Conn |year=1997 |pages= [https://books.google.com/books?id=asBnYmKKz6kC&pg=PA197#v=onepage&q&f=false 197] |isbn=978-0-8195-6309-5 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref> This aspect of the Roland TR-808 was especially appealing to producers who would test drive their tracks in nightclubs (like NYC's Funhouse), where the bass drum sound was essential for a record's success.<ref>Harvey, Steven "The Perfect Beat" The Face Magazine, October, 1983</ref> Its unique percussion sounds like handclaps, open and closed high-hat, clave and cowbell became integral to the electro sound.  A number of popular songs in the early 1980s employed the TR-808, including Marvin Gaye's “Sexual Healing,” Cybotron's “Clear,” and Afrika Bambaataa's “Planet Rock.”<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Grove Dictionary of American Music|last=Dayal|first=Geeta|publisher=Oxford Music Online|year=2013|isbn=|location=|pages=Roland TR–808}}</ref> The Roland TR-808 has attained iconic status, eventually being used on more hits than any other drum machine.<ref>{{citation|title=A Beginner's Guide to Digital Video|author=Peter Wells|publisher=AVA Books|year=2004|isbn=978-2-88479-037-6|page=18|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=stvOCfhc_igC&pg=PA18|accessdate=2011-05-20}}</ref> Through the use of samples, the Roland TR-808 remains popular in electro and other genres to the present day.

Other electro instrumentation was generally electronic, favoring [[analog synthesizer|analog synthesis]], programmed bass lines, sequenced or arpeggiated synthetic riffs, and atonal sound effects all created with [[synthesizers]]. Heavy use of effects such as [[reverb]]s, [[Delay (audio effect)|delays]], [[Chorus effect|chorus]] or [[Phaser (effect)|phasers]] along with eerie synthetic ensemble strings or pad sounds emphasized the [[science fiction]] or [[futuristic]] themes of classic (1980s) electro, represented in the lyrics and/or music. Electro hip hop group [[Warp 9]]'s 1983 single, [[Light Years Away (Warp 9 song)|Light Years Away]], produced and written by [[Lotti Golden]] and Richard Scher, exemplifies the [[Sci-Fi]], [[afrofuturist]] aspect of electro,<ref name=Toop-2000 /> reflected in both the lyrics and instrumentation. The imagery of its lyrical refrain ''space is the place for the human race'' pays homage to [[Sun Ra]]'s 1974 film,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0072195/|title=Space Is the Place|publisher=|via=www.imdb.com}}</ref> while its synth lines and sound effects are informed by sci-fi, computer games, and cartoons,"born of a science-fiction revival.".<ref name=Toop-2000 />{{rp|148}}

Most electro is instrumental, but a common element is vocals processed through a [[vocoder#Musical applications|vocoder]]. Additionally, [[speech synthesis]] may be used to create robotic or mechanical lyrical content, as in the iconic [[Planet Rock (song)|Planet Rock]] and the automatous chant in the chorus of [[Nunk (song)|Nunk]] by [[Warp 9]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qXTuAAAAMAAJ&q=Warp+9+music+group|title=Newsweek|first1=Raymond|last1=Moley|first2=Joseph Becker|last2=Phillips|first3=Malcolm|last3=Muir|first4=Rex|last4=Smith|first5=Samuel Thurston|last5=Williamson|date=20 November 1983|publisher=Newsweek, Incorporated|via=Google Books}}</ref> Although primarily instrumental, early electro utilized rap. Male rap dominated the genre, however female rappers are an integral part of the electro tradition, whether featured in a group as in [[Warp 9]] or as solo performers like [[Roxanne Shante]]. The lyrical style that emerged along with electro became less popular by the 1990s, as rapping continued to evolve, becoming the domain of [[hip hop music]].

About electro origins:
{{Cquote|It was all about stretching the boundaries that had begun to stifle black music, and its influences lay not only with German technopop wizards [[Kraftwerk]], the acknowledged forefathers of pure electro, plus British futurist acts like the [[Human League]] and [[Gary Numan]], but also with a number of pioneering black musicians. Major artists like [[Miles Davis]], [[Sly Stone]], [[Herbie Hancock]], [[Stevie Wonder]], legendary producer [[Norman Whitfield]] and, of course, [[George Clinton (funk musician)|George Clinton]] and his P Funk brigade, would all play their part in shaping this new sound via their innovative use of [[electronic instruments]] during the 70’s (and as early as the late 60’s in Miles Davis’s case).|||[[Greg Wilson (DJ)|Greg Wilson]]}}
{{cquote|Gary Numan. Man he was dope. So important to us. When we heard that single, "Are Friends Electric?" it was like the aliens had landed in the Bronx.

Following the decline of [[disco]] music in the late 1970s, various funk artists such as [[Zapp & Roger]] began experimenting with [[talk box]]es and the use of heavier, more distinctive beats. [[Boogie (genre)|Boogie]] played a role during the formative years of electro, notably "Feels Good" by Electra ([[Emergency Records|Emergency]] – EMDS-6527),<ref name=Kraftinwork/> the [[post-disco]] production "[[You're the One for Me (D.

Although the early 1980s were electro's heyday in the mainstream, it enjoyed renewed popularity in the late 1990s with artists such as [[Anthony Rother]] and DJs such as [[Dave Clarke (techno DJ)|Dave Clarke]], and has made yet another comeback for a third wave of popularity in 2007. The continued interest in electro, though influenced to a great degree by Florida, Detroit, Miami, Los Angeles and New York styles, has primarily taken hold in Florida and Europe with electro club nights becoming commonplace again. The scene still manages to support hundreds of electro labels, from the disco electro of Clone Records, to the [[old school hip hop|old school]] [[b-boy]] styles of Breakin’ Records and Dominance Electricity, to the electrofunk of [[Citinite]], and to harder more modern styles of electro of labels like Bass Frequency Productions and Nu Illusion Music.

New branches of electro have risen over the last couple of years.  Florida has pioneered the "Electrocore" sound, started in the late 1990s by artists like Jackal and Hyde and Dynamix II and carried on to this day. [[Skweee]] is a genre which developed in Nordic countries such as [[Sweden]] and [[Finland]], hence its first name "Scandinavian Funk". The outlets and artists of Skweee are still mostly limited to the Nordic countries.

From the late 1990s onward, the term "electro" is also used to refer two other fusion genres of electro, either blended with [[techno]] and [[new wave music|new wave]] in [[electroclash]],<ref>{{Cite journal |last=D.
