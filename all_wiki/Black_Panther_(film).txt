'''''Black Panther''''' is a 2018 American [[superhero film]] based on the [[Marvel Comics]] character [[Black Panther (comics)|of the same name]]. Produced by [[Marvel Studios]] and distributed by [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures]], it is [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|the 18th film]] in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU). The film was directed by [[Ryan Coogler]], who co-wrote the screenplay with [[Joe Robert Cole]], and it stars <!-- Order per this source: https://news.marvel.com/movies/58647/marvel-studios-begins-production-black-panther-2/ -->[[Chadwick Boseman]] as [[T'Challa (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|T'Challa / Black Panther]] alongside [[Michael B.

[[Wesley Snipes]] expressed interest in working on a Black Panther film in 1992, but the project did not come to fruition. In September 2005, Marvel Studios announced a Black Panther film as one of ten based on Marvel characters and distributed by [[Paramount Pictures]]. [[Mark Bailey (writer)|Mark Bailey]] was hired to write a script in January 2011. ''Black Panther'' was officially announced in October 2014, and Boseman made his first appearance as the character in ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'' (2016). Cole and Coogler had joined by then, with additional casting in May making ''Black Panther'' the first Marvel film with both a predominantly [[Black film|black cast]] and a black director. Principal photography took place from January to April 2017 at [[EUE/Screen Gems]] Studios in the [[Atlanta metropolitan area]], and [[Busan]], South Korea.

''Black Panther'' premiered in Los Angeles on January 29, 2018, and was released theatrically in the United States on February 16, as part of [[Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase Three|Phase Three]] of the MCU. Critics praised its direction, screenplay, acting (particularly that of Boseman, Jordan, and Wright), costume design, production values, and soundtrack, although the [[Computer-generated imagery|CG effects]] received some criticism. Many critics considered it to be one of the best films set in the MCU and noted its cultural significance, with organizations including the [[National Board of Review Awards 2018#Top 10 Films|National Board of Review]] and [[American Film Institute Awards 2018#Top 10 Films|American Film Institute]] naming it one of the top 10 films of 2018. The film grossed over $1.3&nbsp;billion worldwide and broke numerous box office records, including the highest-grossing film by a [[Black people|black]] director. It became the [[List of highest-grossing films|ninth-<!--This is the PEAK POSITION the film achieved NOT the CURRENT. Please do NOT adjust!-->highest-grossing film]] of all time, the [[List of highest-grossing films in the United States and Canada|third-highest-grossing film]] in the U.S. and Canada, and the [[2018 in film#Highest-grossing films|second-highest-grossing film of 2018]].

The film received numerous [[List of accolades received by Black Panther (film)|awards and nominations]], with seven nominations at the [[91st Academy Awards]] including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], with wins for [[Academy Award for Best Costume Design|Best Costume Design]], [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]], and [[Academy Award for Best Production Design|Best Production Design]]. ''Black Panther'' is the first superhero film to receive a Best Picture nomination and the first MCU film to win an Academy Award. It also received three nominations at the [[76th Golden Globe Awards]], two wins at the [[25th Screen Actors Guild Awards]], and three wins at the [[24th Critics' Choice Awards]] from twelve nominations, among others.<!-- Please note.

== Plot ==
<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words only. -->
Thousands of years ago, five African tribes war over a meteorite containing the metal [[vibranium]]. One warrior ingests a "heart-shaped herb" affected by the metal and gains superhuman abilities, becoming the first "Black Panther". He unites all but the Jabari Tribe to form the nation of [[Wakanda (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Wakanda]]. Over centuries, the Wakandans use the vibranium to develop advanced technology and isolate themselves from the world by posing as a [[Third World]] country. In 1992, Wakanda's King [[T'Chaka]] visits his brother N'Jobu, who is working undercover in [[Oakland, California]]. T'Chaka accuses N'Jobu of assisting black-market arms dealer [[Ulysses Klaue (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Ulysses Klaue]] with stealing vibranium from Wakanda. N'Jobu's partner reveals he is [[Zuri (comics)|Zuri]], another undercover Wakandan, and confirms T'Chaka's suspicions.

In the present day, following T'Chaka's death,{{refn|name=Timeline|group=N|As depicted in the 2016 film ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]''.<ref name="Synopsis" />}} his son [[T'Challa (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|T'Challa]] returns to Wakanda to assume the throne. He and [[Okoye (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Okoye]], the leader of the [[Dora Milaje]] regiment, extract T'Challa's ex-lover [[Malice (Nakia)|Nakia]] from an undercover assignment so she can attend his coronation ceremony with his mother [[Ramonda (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Ramonda]] and younger sister [[Shuri (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Shuri]]. At the ceremony, the Jabari Tribe's leader [[M'Baku (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|M'Baku]] challenges T'Challa for the crown in ritual combat. T'Challa defeats M'Baku and persuades him to yield rather than die.

When Klaue and his accomplice [[Erik Stevens]] steal a Wakandan artifact from a London museum, T'Challa's friend and Okoye's lover [[W'Kabi]] urges him to bring Klaue back alive. T'Challa, Okoye, and Nakia travel to [[Busan]], [[South Korea]], where Klaue plans to sell the artifact to [[CIA]] agent [[Everett K. Ross]]. A firefight erupts, and Klaue attempts to flee but is caught by T'Challa, who reluctantly releases him to Ross' custody. Klaue tells Ross that Wakanda's international image is a front for a technologically advanced civilization. Erik attacks and extracts Klaue as Ross is gravely injured protecting Nakia. Rather than pursue Klaue, T'Challa takes Ross to Wakanda, where their technology can save him.

While Shuri heals Ross, T'Challa confronts Zuri about N'Jobu. Zuri explains that N'Jobu planned to share Wakanda's technology with people of African descent around the world to help them conquer their oppressors. As T'Chaka arrested N'Jobu, the latter attacked Zuri and forced T'Chaka to kill him. T'Chaka ordered Zuri to lie that N'Jobu had disappeared and left behind N'Jobu's American son to maintain the lie. This boy grew up to be Stevens, a U.S. [[black ops]] soldier who adopted the name "Killmonger". Meanwhile, Killmonger kills Klaue and takes his body to Wakanda. He is brought before the tribal elders, revealing his identity to be N'Jadaka and claim to the throne. Killmonger challenges T'Challa to ritual combat, where he kills Zuri, defeats T'Challa, and hurls him over a waterfall to his presumed death. Killmonger ingests the heart-shaped herb and orders the rest incinerated, but Nakia extracts one first. Killmonger, supported by W'Kabi and his army, prepares to distribute shipments of Wakandan weapons to operatives around the world.

Nakia, Shuri, Ramonda, and Ross flee to the Jabari Tribe for aid. They find a comatose T'Challa, rescued by the Jabari in repayment for sparing M'Baku's life. Healed by Nakia's herb, T'Challa returns to fight Killmonger, who dons his own Black Panther suit. W'Kabi and his army fight Shuri, Nakia, and the Dora Milaje, while Ross remotely pilots a jet and shoots down planes carrying the vibranium weapons. M'Baku and the Jabari arrive to reinforce T'Challa. Confronted by Okoye, W'Kabi and his army stand down. Fighting in Wakanda's vibranium mine, T'Challa disrupts Killmonger's suit and stabs him. Killmonger refuses to be healed, choosing to die a free man rather than be incarcerated; T'Challa takes him to the waterfall where they fought, where Killmonger dies peacefully.

T'Challa establishes an outreach center at the building where N'Jobu died, to be run by Nakia and Shuri. In a mid-credits scene, T'Challa appears before the [[United Nations]] to reveal Wakanda's true nature to the world. In a post-credits scene, Shuri helps [[Bucky Barnes (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Bucky Barnes]] with his recovery.

Gurira said that the fighting skills she learned playing Michonne complemented the skills of Okoye,<ref name="GuriraMoG" /> but noted that the Dora Milaje are a [[secret service]], which covers intel as well as fighting. She explained that though the character is stoic, "she also has an unexpected sense of humor. She has a heart, but for her country and for her people."<ref name="EWGuriraJuly2017" /> Gurira's head was re-shaved every day to have her head tattoos applied, which took two-and-a-half to three-and-a-half hours.<ref name="Fashionista" />

So they have a deep moral conscience."<ref name="ComingSoonSDCC" /> Character elements from [[Christopher Priest (comics)|Christopher Priest]]'s 1998â2003 ''Black Panther'' series were adapted for M'Baku's portrayal in the film.<ref name="NoManApe" /> M'Baku is not referred to in the film by his comics alter ego "Man-Ape", since Marvel felt there were "a lot of racial implications that don't sit well" in having a black character dress up as an ape. This aspect of the character was instead reworked to have the Jabari tribe worship the gorilla gods, with M'Baku still wearing elements of fur on his arms and legs and a chest-plate that hints at the gorilla. Moore continued, "Man-Ape is a problematic character for a lot of reasons, but the idea {{em|behind}} Man-Ape we thought was really fascinating ... It's a line I think we're walking, and hopefully walking successfully."<ref name="NoManApe" /> To further differentiate the Jabari, Duke spoke a version of the Nigerian [[Igbo language]] rather than the [[Xhosa language]] spoken by other Wakandans.<ref name="PressKit" />{{rp|23}}

He compared the character to [[Osama bin Laden]].<ref name="EWBosemanJuly2017" /> Serkis added that in addition to his desire for vibranium, Klaue is motivated by a "personal" vendetta against T'Challa, and "to expose what he thinks is the hypocrisy of Wakanda".<ref name="IGNSerkisOct2017" />

=== Development ===
In June 1992, [[Wesley Snipes]] announced his intention to make a film about [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]],<ref name="CarrJun92" /> and began work on it by that August.<ref name="CarrAug92" /> Snipes felt that Africa had been [[Stereotypes of Africans|portrayed poorly in Hollywood films]] previously, and that this film could highlight the majesty of the continent due to the character being noble and "the antithesis of [African] stereotypes".<ref name="SnipesTHRJan2018" /> The next July, Snipes planned to begin ''The Black Panther'' after starring in ''[[Demolition Man (film)|Demolition Man]]'' (1993),<ref name="Snipes" /> and a month later he expressed interest in making sequels to the film as well.<ref name="PersallAug93" /> In January 1994, Snipes entered talks with [[Columbia Pictures]] to portray Black Panther,<ref name="BrodieJan94" /> and Black Panther co-creator [[Stan Lee]] joined the film by March;<ref name="PittsMar94" /> it entered early development by May.<ref name="LoveceMay94" /> Snipes had discussions with several different screenwriters and directors about the project, including [[Mario Van Peebles]] and [[John Singleton]].<ref name="SnipesTHRJan2018" /> When the film had not progressed by January 1996, Lee explained that he had not been pleased with the scripts for the project.<ref name="NyeJan96" /> Snipes said that one of the issues with the project's development was confusion among those unfamiliar with the comics, who thought the film was about the [[Black Panther Party]].<ref name="SnipesTHRJan2018" />

In July 1997, ''Black Panther'' was listed as part of [[Marvel Comics]]' film slate,<ref name="DawesJul97" /> and in March 1998, Marvel reportedly hired [[Joe Quesada]] and [[Jimmy Palmiotti]], who at the time were editors of the Black Panther comics, to work on it;<ref name="SmithMar98" /><ref name="SnipesTHRJan2018" /> Quesada and Palmiotti have both denied this.<ref name="SnipesTHRJan2018" /> That August, corporate problems at Marvel put the project on hold.<ref name="FortesAug98" /> A year later, Snipes was set to produce, and possibly star, in the film,<ref name="RadfordAug99" /> while [[Artisan Entertainment]] announced a deal with Marvel in May 2000 to co-produce, finance, and distribute the film.<ref name="ArtisanDeal" /> In March 2002, Snipes planned to make the film or ''[[Blade: Trinity|Blade 3]]'' (2004) over the next year.<ref name="GuzmanMar02" /> In July 2004, ''Blade 3'' director [[David S. Goyer]] stated that he felt Snipes starring as Black Panther in addition to Marvel's [[Blade (comics)|Blade]] "might be overkill".<ref name="MorrisJul04" />

In September 2005, Marvel chairman and CEO [[Avi Arad]] announced ''Black Panther'' as one of ten films being developed by the new [[Marvel Studios]].<ref name="IGNSept05" /> Marvel Studios received financing to produce the slate of ten films to be distributed by [[Paramount Pictures]].<ref name="10Films" /> In June 2006, Snipes said he hoped to have a director for the project soon,<ref name="MaloneJun06" /> and Marvel Studios president [[Kevin Feige]] reiterated in February 2007 that ''Black Panther'' was in development.<ref name="RadfordFeb07" /> By that July, Singleton had been approached to direct the film.<ref name="MoralesJul07" /> In March 2009, Marvel hired writers to help come up with creative ways to launch its lesser-known properties, including Black Panther;<ref name="Writers2009" /> Nate Moore, the head of the writers program, was overseeing the development of ''Black Panther'' specifically.<ref name="MooreMay2016" /> Snipes' involvement stalled at this time, as he was convicted of failing to file a tax return, serving his sentence from June 2010 to April 2013.<ref name="SnipesSyFyTimeline" /> In January 2011, Marvel Studios hired documentary filmmaker [[Mark Bailey (writer)|Mark Bailey]] to write a script for ''Black Panther'', to be produced by Feige.<ref name="January2011BlackPanther" /> By October 2013, the metal [[vibranium]], which comes from Black Panther's home nation [[Wakanda]], was introduced in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]];<ref name="FeigeOct2013" /> Marvel had considered showing Wakanda itself as early as ''[[Iron Man 2]]'' (2010), but were waiting until they had "a full idea" of how to depict it.<ref name="ColliderJan2018" />

In October 2014, Feige announced that ''Black Panther'' would be released on November 3, 2017, with [[Chadwick Boseman]] cast as T'Challa / Black Panther.<ref name="Oct2014Event" /><ref name="Boseman" /> Boseman did not audition for the role, instead discussing what he wanted to do with the part with Marvel,<ref name="BosemanEWNov2014" /> and earned $2&nbsp;million for appearing in the film.<ref name="BosemanPay" /> The actor was set to first portray the character in ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]''.<ref name="Boseman" /> Snipes gave his support for the project, despite no longer being involved.<ref name="SnipesTHRJan2018" /> Feige said that Marvel was considering minority writers and directors for the film, but would prioritize "the best filmmakers, the best writers, the best directors possible. So I'm not going to say for sure that we're going to hire from any one demographic". He added that they had met with former ''Black Panther'' comics writer [[Reginald Hudlin]].<ref name="Oct2014EventQA" /> In January 2015, Boseman said that the film was going through a "brainstorming phase",<ref name="CBRFeb2015" /> and the next month Marvel pushed back the release date to July 6, 2018.<ref name="Feb2015Dates" /> Also in February, Feige stated that casting for the film was underway, and added that he was set to meet with directors about the film following the release of ''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]'' at the end of April.<ref name="FeigeApril2015" />

By May 2015, Marvel had discussions with [[Ava DuVernay]] to work on either ''Black Panther'' or ''[[Captain Marvel (film)|Captain Marvel]]'' (2019) as director.<ref name="DuVernay" /> In June, Feige confirmed that he had met with several directors, including DuVernay, and said that he expected a decision to be made by mid- to late 2015.<ref name="FeigeJune2015" /> By early July, DuVernay had passed on directing the film,<ref name="DuVernayNo" /> explaining that she had been drawn to the cultural importance of depicting a black hero to the whole world, but disagreed with Marvel on the story and did not want to compromise her vision.<ref name="DuVernayNo" /><ref name="DuVernayMore" /> By October 2015, [[F. Gary Gray]] and [[Ryan Coogler]] had been considered as directors for the film,<ref name="GrayDirector" /><ref name="Coogler" /> though negotiations with Coogler had cooled,<ref name="Coogler" /> and Gray had chosen to direct ''[[The Fate of the Furious]]'' (2017) instead.<ref name="GrayFurious8" /> [[Joe Robert Cole]], a member of the Marvel writers program, was in talks to write the screenplay,<ref name="Cole" /> and Marvel changed the release date once again, moving it to February 16, 2018.<ref name="Phase3Update" /> By December, discussions with Coogler were reignited after the successful opening of his film ''[[Creed (film)|Creed]]'' (2015).<ref name="Coogler" />

=== Pre-production ===
Coogler was confirmed as director in January 2016,<ref name="Coogler2" /> and said that the film was his "most personal movie to date" in part because he grew up reading comics,<ref name="CooglerPersonal" /><ref name="CooglerReaction" /> adding, "I feel really fortunate to be able to work on something I'm this passionate about again."<ref name="CooglerReaction" /><ref name="CooglerReaction2" /> After being "wooed" by Feige for months, Coogler agreed to direct the film if he could bring collaborators from his previous films to differentiate the film from other MCU films that are often "shot, composed, and edited by the same in-house people". This included ''[[Fruitvale Station]]'' (2013) cinematographer [[Rachel Morrison]],<ref name="BeachlerMorrison" /> as well as production designer [[Hannah Beachler]] and composer [[Ludwig GÃ¶ransson]], who both worked with Coogler on ''Fruitvale Station'' and ''Creed''.<ref name="BeachlerMorrison" /><ref name="VultureApril2017" /> Coogler felt ''Black Panther'' would be unique while still fitting within the MCU's overall narrative.<ref name="CooglerPersonal" />

In April 2016, Feige said that Coogler was working on the script with Cole, and that filming would begin at the beginning of 2017.<ref name="CooglerDraft" /> He added that the film would be the first Marvel Studios production to feature a "primarily African-American cast":<ref name="EmpireFeb2016" /><ref name="FeigeBlackCast" /> [[Lupita Nyong'o]] soon entered negotiations to star as T'Challa's love interest,<ref name="Nyong'o" /> and [[Michael B. Jordan]] joined in an undisclosed role, after previously working with Coogler on ''Fruitvale Station'' and ''Creed''.<ref name="Jordan" /> Nate Moore, serving as a producer on the film by the end of May, stated that filming would occur in Atlanta, Georgia, with Marvel "definitely investigating shooting in Africa" as well.<ref name="MooreMay2016" />

At [[San Diego Comic-Con]] 2016, Nyong'o was confirmed for the film, in the role of [[Malice (comics)|Nakia]], while Jordan's role was revealed to be [[Erik Stevens|Erik Killmonger]]. Also announced was [[Danai Gurira]] as [[Okoye (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Okoye]]. Coogler confirmed that filming would begin in January 2017.<ref name="SDCC2016" /><ref name="SDCC2016CBR" /> Additional casting occurred from September 2016 until the start of filming, with [[Winston Duke]] cast as [[M'Baku (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|M'Baku]], a role that [[Yahya Abdul-Mateen II]] had also tested for;<ref name="Duke" /> [[Forest Whitaker]] as [[Zuri (comics)|Zuri]]; [[Daniel Kaluuya]] as [[W'Kabi]];<ref name="Whitaker" /> [[Angela Bassett]] as T'Challa's mother, Ramonda;<ref name="Bassett" /> [[Sterling K. Brown]] as N'Jobu;<ref name="Brown" /> and [[Letitia Wright]] in an unspecified role.<ref name="Wright" /> [[Florence Kasumba]] was revealed to be reprising her role as Ayo from ''Captain America: Civil War''.<ref name="Whitaker" /> [[Amandla Stenberg]], who is bi-racial and light skinned, was considered for a role in the film but was not comfortable taking the place of a dark-skinned actor, and described her decision to pass on the role as "really challenging".<ref name="Stenberg" /> By January 2017, Marvel received permission from the [[Oakland, California]]-based public transit agency [[AC Transit]] to use their logo in the film for the opening flashback sequence. The setting was chosen due to Coogler growing up in that area.<ref name="ACTransitLogo" />

==== Writing ====
[[File:Ryan Coogler by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Coogler promoting ''Black Panther'' at the 2016 San Diego Comic-Con]]
The production team was inspired by [[Ta-Nehisi Coates]]' run on ''Black Panther'', who was writing the comic at the same time as they were working on the film. Of particular inspiration was Coates' poetic dialogue, [[Brian Stelfreeze]]'s art, and "some of the questions that it's asking".<ref name="CooglerVulture" /> The film was also inspired by the comic runs of [[Jack Kirby]], [[Christopher Priest (comics)|Christopher Priest]] (which Coogler felt most influenced the film), [[Jonathan Hickman]], and Hudlin. Characters for the film were picked from throughout the comics based on what worked for the film's story.<ref name="ComingSoonSDCC" /> The ceremonial betrothal aspect of the Dora Milaje was not adapted from the comics for the film.<ref name="ColliderJan2018" /> Coogler had hoped to include [[Spider-Man]] villain [[Kraven the Hunter]] early in the process because of a scene in Priest's run that had T'Challa fighting Kraven, but the rights to the character were not available.<ref name="Kraven" /> [[Donald Glover]] and his brother [[Stephen Glover (screenwriter)|Stephen]] made some minor contributions to an early draft of the script, developing the relationship between T'Challa and his younger sister [[Shuri (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Shuri]].<ref name="Glover" /> Moore noted that an early script had more scenes outside of Wakanda to explore "what it means to be African and African-American in the world a bit more", and hoped these could be revisited in a later film, particularly a "super cool" sequence that was [[storyboard]]ed before being cut.<ref name="MooreHuffPostMay2018" />

Feige described ''Black Panther'' as "a big geopolitical action adventure" that focuses on family and T'Challa learning to be king,<ref name="EmpireFeb2016" /> with ''Civil War'' laying the groundwork for T'Challa's morality and establishing the geopolitical landscape that he would have to deal with on returning to Wakanda.<ref name="FeigeApr2016" /> Moore compared the politics and humor of the film to ''[[Captain America: The Winter Soldier]]'' (2014), saying that the former would be inherent but not "preachy", and that the latter would avoid the tones of ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (film)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'' (2014) and ''[[Ant-Man (film)|Ant-Man]]'' (2015).<ref name="ColliderJan2018" /> He also said the film would be a cross between ''[[The Godfather]]'' (1972) and the [[James Bond in film|James Bond films]] as a "big, operatic family drama centered around a world of international espionage".<ref name="EWCoverJuly2017" /> Coogler was influenced by 1970s films such as the works of [[Francis Ford Coppola]] in that decade, as well as crime fiction. He also watched the film ''[[A Prophet]]'' (2009) for inspiration.<ref name="CooglerFandangoJan2018" /> Feige called the film's story "rich in culturally relevant ideas", with Boseman indicating there were parallels to "pull from" in the film in relation to [[Donald Trump]] becoming [[President of the United States]] after [[Barack Obama]], though Feige added that "these are conversations we were having two years ago because that is inherently the story within the comics."<ref name="EWBosemanJuly2017" /> Moore said the film does not depend on the plots of any other MCU films, but it does affect the wider MCU moving forward,<ref name="ColliderJan2018" /> with Feige stating the film was "a very important" link to ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]'' (2018) and ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'' (2019).<ref name="EmpireFeb2016" /><ref name="FeigeGenreDescription" /> ''Civil War'' did introduce the Wakandan language, based on the [[Xhosa language]], which Boseman was taught by [[John Kani]], who portrays T'Challa's father, King [[T'Chaka]].<ref name="Xhosa" /> Additional actors portraying Wakandans in ''Black Panther'' learned the language,<ref name="Nyongo/Film" /> with Coogler making the use of the language "a priority... as much as possible". Coogler tried to incorporate Xhosa "in natural and authentic situations", such as when multiple Wakandans were speaking in the presence of nonnatives and wanted to say something they would not understand. John Kani's son [[Atandwa Kani|Atandwa]] served as a dialect coach on the film along with his father.<ref name="NYTimesXhosa" />

==== Design ====
Cole called the film an historic opportunity to depict a black superhero "at a time when African-Americans are affirming their identities while dealing with vilification and dehumanization". It was important to root the film in the actual cultures of Africa, with the filmmakers consulting with experts on the region of Africa that Wakanda is supposed to be located in,<ref name="Cole2" /> rooting the film "in reality first and then build[ing] out from there".<ref name="ColeAug2016" /> Coogler's vision for Wakanda was inspired by the southern African country [[Lesotho]], a country which has historically been "an enclave, able to protect its independence because of its terrain" and was only lightly [[Basutoland|colonized by the British]];<ref name="LesothoTimes" /><ref name="LesothoVulture" /> the country's traditional blankets are also featured in the film.<ref name="LesothoTimes" /> Coogler compared the rarity of vibranium existing only in Wakanda to the real-life mineral [[coltan]] that can almost only be found in Congo.<ref name="BlackCaucusPanel" /> He wanted Wakanda to feel like a full country with multiple distinct tribes,<ref name="NoManApe" /> and created a project bible that detailed each Wakandan tribe to guide the design process. Special care was taken to create a futuristic look that was not alien,<ref name="ColliderJan2018" /> as some of Jack Kirby's original comic designs appeared.<ref name="MarvelProductionDesign" />

===== Sets =====
Beachler wanted to honor the comic designs, but fill in the gaps with research concentrated on [[Sub-Saharan Africa]], pulling inspiration from [[Uganda]], [[Rwanda]], [[Burundi]], [[Congo-Kinshasa]], [[Ethiopia]],<ref name="BeachlerAug2017" /> as well as the designs of [[Zaha Hadid]],<ref name="ColliderJan2018" /> and the pre-colonization architecture of the historic [[Mali Empire]] and the city of [[Timbuktu]].<ref name="CooglerTimbuktu" /> Moore described this approach of taking inspiration from many different sources as a [[love letter]] to Africa.<ref name="ColliderJan2018" /> Beachler looked at the architecture of existing tribes, and then tried to advance the technology naturally rather than if Wakanda had been colonized.<ref name="BeachlerAug2017" /> Circular motifs, signifying the transmission of energy, were an important theme throughout the film. Older locations depicted in the film, such as Warrior Falls, the City of the Dead, and the Hall of Kings, were juxtaposed with the more modern [[Afro-punk]] style of the Golden City, the capital.<ref name="ColliderJan2018" /> [[Rondavel]]s were incorporated into the tops of Wakanda's skyscrapers, inspired by the appearance of mountains at [[Blyde River Canyon]] in South Africa.<ref name="BeachlerAug2017" />

Beachler created different sigils and architecture for each of the Wakandan tribes, with the Border Tribe inspired by [[Lesotho]], the Merchant Tribe having a sigil based on [[Nigerian]] writing, and the Golden Tribe using a sun symbol found throughout Africa. Gorilla City, home to the Jabari Tribe, was originally set in a rain forest, but Coogler suggested that it be found up a mountain in snow.<ref name="ColliderJan2018" /> Beachler based the written form of the Wakandan language on an old Nigerian language. She consulted with mining and metallurgy experts for the vibranium technology,<ref name="PressKit" />{{rp|15}} including for the vibranium mine where the substance is depicted as glowing blue rocks before it is refined into the [[stainless steel]] look previously seen in the MCU. The film also adapts the kimoyo bead technology from the comics, and features sand-based technology. Beachler wanted futuristic elements of the film to be consistent with projections of what real world technology may be like in 25 or 30 years, such as the [[maglev]] and hovercraft technology used in vehicles. The Wakandan vehicles include a maglev train for carrying vibranium; the king's Royal Talon Fighter, which looks like a mask from the top and bottom; and the Dragon Flyer, inspired by the [[Congo peafowl]].<ref name="ColliderJan2018" />

The majority of Beachler's sets were constructed on sound stages in Atlanta, including the Tribal Council, Shuri's design space, and the Hall of Kings. The Tribal Council set was built with a glass floor through which an old ruin can be seen. The exterior set for Warrior Falls was built on a backlot north of Atlanta, and was inspired by the [[Oribi Gorge]]. The set was {{convert|36|ft}}, made up of a {{convert|6|ft|m|adj=mid|-high|spell=in}} pool, and then {{convert|30|ft|m|adj=mid|-high}} cliff faces that were designed to be extended to {{convert|100|ft}} with visual effects. A framework for the cliffs was hand-sculpted from industrial styrofoam, with a system of tunnels built-in to the design to allow extras to climb up to different areas of the cliffs. The framework was then covered with {{convert|25000|ft3}} of foam that was sculptured to match rocks found at Oribi Gorge. The pool was filled using six large pumps, so as to create a waterfall above the ledge at the bottom. The base of the pool was made from padding so stunts could safely be carried out on the set, but designed to look like rocks and to have enough grip that the actors would not fall over in the water. The set was completed in four months, and was used for two weeks of filming.<ref name="PressKit" />{{rp|16}}

Costume designer [[Ruth E. Carter]] referenced the [[Maasai people|Maasai]], [[Himba people|Himba]], [[Dogon people|Dogon]], [[Sotho people|Basotho]], [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]], [[Turkana people|Turkana]], [[Xhosa people|Xhosa]], [[Zulu people|Zulu]], [[Surma people|Suri]] and [[Dinka people|Dinka]] people in her designs.<ref name="CarterReferences" /><ref name="CarterPretAReporter" /> She also examined appropriate works by Japanese fashion designer [[Issey Miyake]], French fashion designer [[Yves Saint Laurent (designer)|Yves Saint Laurent]], and American fashion designer [[Donna Karan]].<ref name="CarterPretAReporter" /> [[Winnie Mandela]] provided inspiration to Carter for Angela Bassett's costumes.<ref name="ColliderJan2018" />

The Dora Milaje costumes primarily used red to reflect different African cultures, and included beaded tabards that feature talismans that would be passed down from mother to daughter. Carter wanted to avoid the "girls in the bathing suits" look, and instead have the Dora Milaje wear full armor that they would practically need for battle. She also had to take actors' stunt work into consideration.<ref name="ColliderJan2018" /> Anthony Francisco, the Senior Visual Development Illustrator, noted the Dora Milaje costumes were based 80 percent on the Maasai, five percent on [[samurai]], five percent on [[ninja]]s, and five percent on the [[Ifugao people]] from the Philippines. The arm band and neck rings were a reference to the [[Southern Ndebele people]] and denote stature. As such, General Okoye has gold bands and rings while the other Dora Milaje wear silver.<ref name="Fashionista" />

The costumes for T'Challa combined his role as king and as the head of the military, including combining a [[kente cloth]] cloak with military boots.<ref name="ColliderJan2018" /> Carter also used distinct colors and patterns for each of Wakanda's tribes, such as green with shells for the River Tribe based on the Suri; blue with wood for the Border Tribe; black with royal purple for the Black Panther and the Royal Palace;<ref name="ColliderJan2018" /><ref name="Fashionista" /> plums and purples for the Merchant Tribe in reference to the Tuareg; and ochre for the Mining Tribe inspired by the Himba.<ref name="Fashionista" /> Three out of every five people in Wakanda go barefoot. The Wakandans wear "normal" clothes outside of the country, with the colors of their costumes kept consistent.<ref name="ColliderJan2018" /> Overall, Carter created 700 costumes for the film, working with "an army" of illustrators, designers, mold makers, fabric dyers, jewelry makers and more.<ref name="CarterPretAReporter" />

Hair department head Camille Friend referenced traditional African art, fabrics, hair, and textures, and the current-day natural hair movement in her designs. Friend strived to keep the actors' hair natural, using "braids, locs and twists", and when necessary, extensions and wigs. As with Carter, Friend designed each tribe to have their own identifiable aesthetic, such as the Jabari Tribe having hair styled with "very straight, clean lines" and war-paint detail, inspired by Senegalese warriors.<ref name="Fashionista" />

=== Filming ===
[[Principal photography]] had begun by January 21, 2017,<ref name="Freeman" /><!-- Specific date source needed when available --> at [[EUE/Screen Gems]] Studios in the [[Atlanta metropolitan area]],<ref name="AtlantaFilming" /><ref name="BPInfinityWar" /> under the working title ''Motherland''.<ref name="WorkingTitle" /><ref name="Busan" /> Filming also took place at [[Pinewood Studios Atlanta]],<ref name="PinewoodAtlanta" /> and in the [[Sweet Auburn]] neighborhood in Atlanta, which doubled as Oakland; the [[High Museum of Art]], which served as the fictional Museum of Great Britain in London; and [[Atlanta City Hall]], which served as a United Nations building.<ref name="AtlantaFilming" /><ref name="AtlantaFilming2" /> Cinematographer Rachel Morrison, who was eager to work on ''Black Panther'' after working with Coogler on ''Fruitvale Station'',<ref name="Arri" /> first watched all of the other MCU films to understand the established "language". She wanted to "push" that language and feature more contrast in color. Visual effects supervisor Geoff Baumann provided Morrison with before-and-after shots of scenes from ''Civil War'' so she could understand what elements are captured on set and what is created digitally.<ref name="MorrisonVF" /> She filmed in 3.4K [[ArriRaw]] with [[Arri Alexa#Alexa XT|Arri Alexa XT Plus]] cameras and [[Panavision]] Primo lenses,<ref name="FXGuide" /> primarily using a two-camera set-up with a third or fourth camera on occasion. Morrison said that lighting was her biggest challenge, the magnitude of which "was much bigger than I'd experienced before", and made extensive use of Arri SkyPanel [[LED]] light fixtures, which she could preprogram from an [[iPad]]. Some sets were completely surrounded by SkyPanels.<ref name="Arri" />

Shortly after filming started, Atandwa Kani stated that he would appear in the film alongside his father, the latter reprising the role of T'Chaka,<ref name="KanisConfirmed" /> while on-set photographs revealed that [[Martin Freeman]] would reprise his role as [[Everett K. Ross]].<ref name="Freeman" /> Marvel announced that production was underway on January 26, and confirmed the casting of Freeman, Wright, and John Kani, while revealing that [[Andy Serkis]] would reprise his role as [[Ulysses Klaue]] from ''Avengers: Age of Ultron''.<ref name="EWJan2017" /><ref name="MarvelProductionBegins" /> Atandwa portrays a younger version of his father's character, and also served as a cultural consultant during filming. Dialect coach Beth McGuire worked to ensure there was continuity between the various actors who had to use "Wakandan accents".<ref name="PressKit" />{{rp|22}} Jordan joined the production later than the rest of the core cast. He felt that this aided his performance, since his character is separate from and in conflict with the other characters. Because of this, Jordan kept to himself while he was on set.<ref name="ColliderJan2018" /> Since ''Black Panther'' and ''Avengers: Infinity War'' were filming simultaneously in Atlanta, both production teams worked together closely to ensure a unified presentation of Wakanda in the films, as the country also plays a large role in ''Infinity War''.<ref name="BPInfinityWar" />

Additional filming took place in South Korea,<ref name="MarvelProductionBegins" /> with the city of [[Busan]] serving as the setting of a car chase scene that involved 150 cars and over 700 people.<ref name="Busan" /><ref name="BusanTHR" /> Coogler and Morrison referenced the car chase sequences from ''[[Bullitt]]'' (1968), ''[[Drive (2011 film)|Drive]]'' (2011), and ''[[The French Connection (film)|The French Connection]]'' (1971), taking the best elements from each for ''Black Panther''{{'}}s sequence.<ref name="MorrisonVF" /> Filming in Busan began on March 17,<ref name="BusanFilming" /> at the [[Jagalchi Fish Market]].<ref name="JagalchiFishMarket" /> Filming moved to [[Gwangalli Beach]] on March 21,<ref name="BusanFilming" /> with other South Korean filming locations including [[Marine City, Busan|Marine City]] in the [[Haeundae District]] and at the [[Gwangandaegyo]] Bridge.<ref name="BusanTHR" /> The production crew hired hundreds of current and former film students from local universities as staff or assistant staff during the South Korea filming.<ref name="BusanFilming" /> Filming in the country wrapped on March 27,<ref name="BusanTHR" /><!-- while a Korean actor was expected to be cast for the film.<ref name="Busan" />--> with additional location shooting also taking place at the [[Rwenzori Mountains]] and [[Bwindi Impenetrable National Park]] in Uganda.<ref name="FXGuide" /><ref name="Africanews" /> John Marzano served as cinematographer for aerial footage of South Africa, Zambia, Uganda, and South Korea.<ref name="FXGuide" /><ref name="MarzanoFilms" /> At [[CinemaCon]] 2017, Wright was revealed to be portraying Shuri in the film.<ref name="WrightShuri" /> Filming concluded on April 19, 2017.<ref name="VultureApril2017" />

=== Post-production ===
==== Editing ====
''Black Panther'' was edited by Michael Shawver and [[Debbie Berman]], with Shawver spending time on set during filming as well as at an editing suite near the Atlanta production base.<ref name="ShawverPJ" /> Berman joined the film after an initial director's cut had been produced, two weeks after she completed work on Marvel's ''[[Spider-Man: Homecoming]]'' (2017),<ref name="BermanCOW" /> because Coogler likes to have both a male and female editing his films.<ref name="ShawverPJ" /> She believed that she was chosen by Marvel because she is South African, and had been expressing interest in ''Black Panther'' throughout the editing process for ''Homecoming'' after first seeing the character in ''Civil War''.<ref name="BermanCOW" /> Shawver said that a lot of their time editing was spent discussing how their work was affecting the audience. For instance, Shawver felt that initial versions of the first Warrior Falls fight fell "flat" and used techniques he learned working with Coogler on ''Creed'' to have the editing move back-and-forth to mimic the back-and-forth of the fighters. He also felt that adding more reaction shots to the crowd during the fight gave more weight to T'Challa's victory at the end.<ref name="NABCreativeMasters" /> During work on the final battle, Berman pointed out to Coogler that the female Dora Milaje are rescued by the all-male Jabari tribe, which she felt undermined the focus on female characters leading up to that moment. Coogler agreed, and subsequently added female Jabari fighters to the scene through additional photography, including the first onscreen Jabari fighter in the scene. Berman felt that this was an important change that would not have been made if only men were editing the film.<ref name="BermanCOW" />

As first hinted by Coogler in January 2018,<ref name="CooglerFandangoJan2018" /> the film includes two [[post-credit scene]]s: one showing T'Challa address the United Nations; and one featuring [[Sebastian Stan]] reprising his role as [[Bucky Barnes (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Bucky Barnes]].<ref name="PostCreditScenes" /> The first scene was originally intended to be part of the actual ending of the film, but was moved to during the credits so the film could conclude in Oakland, where it begins. Coogler felt having this symmetry was important.<ref name="PostCreditScenesRT" /> In the scene, T'Challa says "The foolish build barriers, while the wise build bridges." Some felt this was a reference to the political climate of the [[presidency of Donald Trump]], but Coogler stated that the line was added before Trump's election and was simply an African proverb that his wife had found. His intention with the scene was to inspire the audience by making T'Challa seem like a real person in a familiar, real-world environment, similar to how Tony Stark was treated in ''[[Iron Man (2008 film)|Iron Man]]'' (2008).<ref name="PostCreditScenesET" /> Coogler was not mandated by Marvel to feature connections to other films, but was interested in addressing the fact that Barnes was in Wakanda (per the end of ''Civil War'') because it would be fun for the audience. He did not feel the character fit in the body of the film, but felt that an end-credits scene was appropriate.<ref name="PostCreditScenesRT" />

==== Visual effects ====
Visual effects for the film were created by: [[Industrial Light & Magic]] (ILM) with help from Virtuos, Stereo D, and [[Scanline VFX]]; [[Double Negative (VFX)|Double Negative]]; [[Luma Pictures]]; Mammal Studios; [[Method Studios]]; Perception; Rise Visual Effects Studios; Torm Studios; Trixter; Cantina Creative; Lola VFX; Capital T; Exceptional Minds; Technicolor VFX; Rodeo FX; Imageloom VFX; Anibrain; Method Pune; Bot VFX; Pixstone Images; Futureworks; Vertigo Visual; FX3X; and Yannix Thailand Co.<ref name="PressKit" />{{rp|xii-xx}}<ref name="ArtofVFX" /> [[Previsualization]] was completed by Digital Domain and The Third Floor.<ref name="PressKit" />{{rp|xi}} Geoffrey Baumann served as visual effects supervisor.<ref name="NABCreativeMasters" />

[[File:Wakanda VFX in Black Panther (film).jpg|thumb|left|[[Previsualization]] (top) and completed visual effects shot of Wakanda by [[Industrial Light & Magic]] (bottom)]]
Comparing ''Black Panther'' to other MCU films, Baumann noted that the visual effects department often have free rein when creating otherworldly science fiction designs, but had to be more specific with this film due to the need to be authentic to African culture and geography. For the Warrior Falls environment, the amphitheater-like cliff walls had to be populated with digital spectators that could not simply be copy-and-pasted around the set due to the precise costume designs created by Carter for each tribe and character. Instead, the visual effects department had to work with the costumers to individually model each digital extra for the sequence. Additionally, visual effects were also used to adjust the opening sequence after test audiences were confusing the characters of T'Chaka and T'Challa, both dressed as the Black Panther. Artists digitally added some grey to T'Chaka's beard and gold trimmings to his suit to help differentiate the characters.<ref name="NABCreativeMasters" />

ILM was primarily responsible for creating the digital urban environments of Wakanda. ILM VFX supervisor Craig Hammack compared this work to his time on ''[[Tomorrowland (film)|Tomorrowland]]'' (2015), but noted the additional challenge of not just building a futuristic city, but also one that was culturally appropriate. He explained that African culture has a "certain amount of earthy material qualities that make things difficult to design as a futuristic city," which would typically use much steel and glass. ILM looked to real life examples that blend modern architecture with natural environments like [[One Central Park]] in [[Sydney]] and [[The Pearl of Africa Hotel Kampala|The Pearl of Africa Hotel]] in [[Kampala]], but also had to "depart from a strict understanding of physics and go into a movie cheat world" at times to produce the desired look. Hammack was also inspired by the architecture of Uganda, where he spent time while aerial footage for the film was being shot. 60,000 individual buildings were designed and modeled for the city, which Hammack said was the first thing ILM began work on and also the last thing they were doing when the film was completed. Other things that ILM worked on during the production included set extensions and blue-screen replacements for interior sets, and the first rhinoceros shown in the film. For T'Challa's ancestral plane scenes, ILM replaced the basic set that was used with a full CG environment including an acacia tree and animated panthers. The sky was based on the [[Aurora|Northern Lights]], with this first designed for nighttime scenes before being replicated for daytime scenes in which the animators had to work hard to keep the effects visible. ILM also added additional sand for the burial sequences so Boseman could breathe during filming, and additional flames when Killmonger burns the heart-shaped herb.<ref name="FXGuide" />

Method Studios created many of the natural environments of Wakanda. The company built a {{convert|3600|km2|abbr=on}} landscape that is visible in various aerial shots in the film, which was based on multiple landscapes from across Africa. Method was also responsible for creating Black Panther's and Killmonger's digital suits, including developing the look of the nanotechnology they use. They created many of the film's digital characters, vehicles, and weapons, with some of those digital creatures being rhinoceroses for the final battle, a sequence that Method did the majority of the work for. Because these rhinoceroses did not have to be seen on screen with the one designed by ILM, only basic structures, scale, and details of the character models had to be shared between the two companies. Much of the work for the final fight included crowd simulation, with Method working alongside the stunt coordinators in motion capture sessions to give each fighter a unique style. In addition to randomizing the height and weight of each digital fighter, the models had to incorporate specific design elements from the costumers. Method also worked on the vibranium mine and Shuri's laboratory, including animating the gadgets seen in the latter.<ref name="FXGuide" />

Luma Pictures worked on the Busan car chase sequence, digitally creating the cars featured in the sequence based on [[CAD]] models and on-set reference. Multiple digital versions of the same car were created, so the production could have the actual cars crash and do various stunts with them, with Luma then inserting the digital versions to augment these moments. Luma also created the sonic forces from Klaue's cannon, while Scanline VFX worked on digitally removing Serkis' left arm for the London museum heist sequence.<ref name="FXGuideBlog" /> Several companies worked on the vibranium sand effects used in Wakandan technology, including ILM for the beginning of the film.<ref name="FXGuide" /> Perception spent 18 months researching real-world technologies, phenomena, and visual themes to aid them in their work on the film. Their designs for the vibranium sand were based on research being done with ultrasonic transducers for the purpose of mid-air haptics and acoustic levitation. They integrated this research into the kimoyo beads worn by Wakandans and as a working interface on the royal talon fighter. Perception also created the traditional displays on the talon fighter and in Shuri's lab. For the talon fighter, the company "experimented with parallax, depth, and volume in the information being displayed, as well as developing a unique color palette to brand the Wakandan tech". In Shuri's lab, Perception adjusted the hues on the wall to match her attire, and for her healing room "proposed that the hexagonal pattern seen on the wall actually reveal itself to be articulating panels" that "pulse and ripple". The company also created the function of Black Panther's suit with nano technology and "layering the suit with different patterns as well as adding 'sub-dermal' luminescent tattoos", the virtual car chase with Shuri and T'Challa, and designed the opening prologue, with the final version created by Storm VFX. Perception also created the main-on-end title sequence.<ref name="PerceptionCaseStudy" />

[[Kendrick Lamar]] produced the film's curated soundtrack, ''Black Panther: The Album'', along with [[Top Dawg Entertainment]] founder Anthony Tiffith, after Coogler wanted to include original songs from Lamar in the film because his "artistic themes align with those we explore in the film".<ref name="LamarSoundtrack" /><ref name="NPRBreakdown" /> The soundtrack features songs that are heard in the film as well as others that are inspired by it, with the other artists featured the majority of "top-billing names" under Top Dawg Entertainment.<ref name="NPRBreakdown" /> GÃ¶ransson collaborated with Lamar and producer [[Sounwave]] on the soundtrack.<ref name="AUReviewOpps" /> Three singles from the album were released throughout January and February 2018: "[[All the Stars]]",<ref name="LamarSoundtrack" /> "[[King's Dead]]",<ref name="KingsDead" /> and "[[Pray for Me (The Weeknd and Kendrick Lamar song)|Pray for Me]]".<ref name="PrayForMe" /> ''Black Panther: The Album'' was released on February 9, 2018,<ref name="USATodayJan2018" /> while a soundtrack of GÃ¶ransson's score was released on February 16.<ref name="ScoreAlbumRelease" /> An [[extended play]] titled ''Black Panther: Wakanda Remixed'', featuring remixes of five cues from GÃ¶ransson's score, was released on August 16, 2018.

[[Todd McCarthy]] of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' highlighted the actors in the film, feeling that Boseman "certainly holds his own, but there are quite a few charismatic supporting players" including Jordan, Nyong'o, and Wright.<ref name="THR_Review" /> Peter Debruge at ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' said the film was one of the best standalone Marvel films so far, and that it "celebrates its hero's heritage".<ref name="Variety_Review" /> Writing for ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[Manohla Dargis]] called ''Black Panther'' "a jolt of a movie", and praised it as an "emblem of a past that was denied and a future that feels very present" due to its focus on black imagination, creation, and liberation.<ref name="NYT_Review" /> At the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', [[Kenneth Turan]] praised the themes of the film and their exploration of what wealthy countries owe to the poor and oppressed, and noted that the film "draws energy from Coogler's sense of excitement at all he's attempting", saying that the film was worth seeing twice which he felt was rare for a modern superhero film.<ref name="LAT_Review" /> [[Richard Roeper]], writing for the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'', called the film "one of the best superhero movies of the century" and said audiences should watch the film if they appreciate "finely honed storytelling with a Shakespearean core; winning performances from an enormously talented ensemble; provocative premises touching on isolationism, revolution and cultures of oppression, and oh yeah, tons of whiz-bang action sequences and good humor".<ref name="Sun-Times_Review" /> Brian Truitt of ''[[USA Today]]'' awarded the film four out of four stars, and called it Marvel Studios' best origin film since ''Guardians of the Galaxy''. Truitt also praised the "superb cast" and stated, "While the themes are deep, ''Black Panther'' is at the same time a visual joy to behold, with confident quirkiness, insane action sequences and special effects, and the glorious reveal of Wakanda".<ref name="USAToday_Review" />

Also giving the film four stars, [[Peter Travers]] of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' called it unlike any other Marvel film, "an exhilarating triumph on every level from writing, directing, acting, production design, costumes, music, special effects to you name it".<ref name="RollingStone_Review" /> Natasha Alford of ''[[The Grio]]'' called the film a "movement, a revolution in progress, and a joy to experience all wrapped into one", and called it "a master class in what it means to be proud of who you are".<ref name="TheGrio_Review" /> [[Jamie Broadnax]] of Black Girl Nerds called the film a masterpiece that is "afro-futuristic and Blackity-black as hell. It's everything I've ever desired in a live-action version of this popular superhero and yet so much more."<ref name="BGN_Review" /> Jamelle Bouie of ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' said, "it is fair to say that ''Black Panther'' is the most political movie ever produced by Marvel Studios, both in its very existence... and in the questions its story raises." He added that the film should be included with ''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman]]'' (1978), ''[[Spider-Man 2]]'' (2004), and ''The Dark Knight'' as superhero films that do not "transcend the genre as much as they embrace it in all its respects". Bouie concluded, "''Black Panther'' could have been just another Marvel romp [but] Coogler and company had the power, and perhaps the responsibility, to do much more. And they did."<ref name="Slate_Review" /> Although praising the film itself and calling it a "refreshing answer to the increasingly stale world of superhero cinema", Devindra Hardawar at [[Engadget]] was critical of the CGI, notably the digital actors used, calling them "weightless, ugly and, worst of all, incredibly distracting". Hardawar felt two "particularly disappointing" CGI shots were when T'Challa flips over a car during the Korea chase, and when T'Challa and Killmonger punch each other as they fall within the vibranium mines.<ref name="EngadgetCGI" />

=== Analysis ===
==== Cultural importance ====
{{quote box|width=33%|align=left|quote=Many have wondered why ''Black Panther'' means so much to the black community and why schools, churches and organizations have come to the theaters with so much excitement. The answer is that the movie brings a moment of positivity to a group of people often not the centerpiece of Hollywood movies... [Racial and ethnic socialization] helps to strengthen identity and helps reduce the likelihood on internalizing negative stereotypes about one's ethnic group.|source=âErlanger Turner, assistant professor of Psychology at the [[University of HoustonâDowntown]]<ref name="TurnerHoustonChronicle" />}}

Writing for ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', Jamil Smith felt ''Black Panther'' would "prove to Hollywood that African-American narratives have the power to generate profits from all audiences", and described it as a resistance to "a regressive cultural and political moment fueled in part by the white-nativist movement... Its themes challenge institutional bias, its characters take unsubtle digs at oppressors, and its narrative includes prismatic perspectives on black life and tradition."<ref name="TimeFeb2018" /> Discussing the film as a defining moment for black America in ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]'', Carvell Wallace said that in contrast to earlier black superhero films, ''Black Panther'' "is steeped very specifically and purposefully in its blackness". He felt Wakanda would become a "promised land" for future generations of black Americans, "untroubled by the criminal horrors of our [current] American existence."<ref name="NYTimesMag" /> Historian Nathan D. B. Connolly said ''Black Panther'' was "a powerful fictional analogy for real-life struggles" that taps into a "500-year history of African-descended people imagining freedom, land and national autonomy." Connolly also felt, culturally, the film would be this generation's ''[[A Raisin in the Sun (1961 film)|A Raisin in the Sun]]'' (1961).<ref name="Connolly" /> Writer and activist [[Shaun King]] found the film to be a cultural moment in American black history similar to [[Rosa Parks]]' [[Montgomery bus boycott]], [[Martin Luther King Jr.]]'s "[[I Have a Dream]]" speech, or [[2008 United States presidential election|Barack Obama being elected president]].<ref name="King" />

By contrast, James Wilt, writing for ''[[Canadian Dimension]]'', stated that "at its core, ''Black Panther'' contains a fundamentally reactionary understanding of black liberation that blatantly advocates [[respectability politics]] over revolution" allowing "white folks such as myself to feel {{em|extremely comfortable}} watching it". Wilt found the scene where Ross is portrayed as "the hero" for shooting down the Wakandan ships to be the film's way of approving the vanquishing of armed resistance against oppression. Wilt also felt that Killmonger was given the "most hideous traits imaginable [making] the only major African-American character and agitator for revolution a manic killer consumed by rage and violence".<ref name="Wilt" /> Russell Rickford of Africa is a Country wrote that Killmonger's role as a character is "to discredit radical internationalism".<ref name="Rickford" /> Faisal Kutty from [[Middle East Eye]] felt the film had underlying [[Islamophobic]] themes, with the only Islamic characters being a [[Boko Haram]]-based group that kidnapped several girls and forced them to wear [[hijab]].<ref name="MiddleEasternEye" />

[[Science & Entertainment Exchange]] Director for the [[National Academy of Sciences]] Richard Loverd felt the film would increase interest in science, technology, and Africa for young black Americans, similarly to how [[The Hunger Games (film series)|''The Hunger Games'' films]] and ''[[Brave (2012 film)|Brave]]'' (2012) sparked girls' interest in archery.<ref name="BlackCaucusPanel" /> Broadnax felt many people who generally do not watch comic book films would go to ''Black Panther'' since "they're going to see themselves reflected in a huge way that they just haven't been able to see before",<ref name="USATodayJan2018Representation" /> especially since the film avoided the plight typically depicted in films about the black experience.<ref name="NYTimesMag" /> She also stated that the strong female characters, such as Shuri, would be an inspiration for girls.<ref name="USATodayJan2018Representation" />

Gil Robertson, co-founder and president of the African American Film Critics Association, called the film "critically important" and "a gate-opener opportunity for other black-centered projects".<ref name="USATodayJan2018Representation" /> Child development expert Deborah Gilboa felt the film would make a huge impact on children's spirits by offering positive role models.<ref name="GoFundMeTodayShow" /> Scholar Marlene D. Allen felt the saying "if you can see it, you can be it" applied to the film, especially with the female characters in the film. Allen felt the women of Wakanda "are the very definition of '[[Black Girl Magic]]', a term coined by CaShawn Thompson in 2013 'to celebrate the beauty, power, and resilience of Black women.{{'"}}<ref name="Allen" /> Tre Johnson of ''Rolling Stone'' felt that "after decades of trying to nail the modern black superhero, we may {{em|finally}} be getting what we've asked for", with Johnson saying ''Black Panther'' felt different from the [[Blaxploitation]] films of the 1970s and the "Blaxploitation-lite" attempts at black superhero films in the 1990s and 2000s because it was "respectable, imaginative and powerful", setting "a new direction" for the depiction of black superheroes.<ref name="RollingStoneTrailer" /> In the film's opening weekend, 37% of audiences in the United States were African-American, according to PostTrak, compared to 35% Caucasian, 18% Hispanic, and 5% Asian.<ref name="DeadlineWknd1" /> This was the most diverse audience for a superhero film ever (African-Americans generally make up 15% of audiences for superhero films).<ref name="THRMarketing" /> In its second weekend, demographics were 37% Caucasian, 33% African American, 18% Hispanic and 7% Asian.<ref name="DeadlineWknd2" />

In early January 2018, philanthropist Frederick Joseph created a [[GoFundMe]] drive to raise money for children of color at the [[Boys & Girls Clubs of America|Boys & Girls Club]] in [[Harlem]] to see ''Black Panther''.<ref name="GoFundMeRoots" /> Joseph said the film was a "rare opportunity" for underserved children of color to see "a black major ... comic book character" brought to film.<ref name="GoFundMeTodayShow" /> Joseph promoted the drive with Boseman on ''[[The Ellen DeGeneres Show]]''. The drive went on to raise over $45,000,<ref name="GoFundMeGuardian" /> exceeding its goal,<ref name="GoFundMeRoots" /> with the money also funding other programs for children in Harlem.<ref name="GoFundMeGuardian" /> Joseph also started the "Black Panther Challenge" where he encouraged other people to create similar drives for their communities.<ref name="GoFundMeRoots" /> GoFundMe made a centralized site for those wishing to start a drive for the challenge.<ref name="GoFundMeVibe" /> 400 additional drives were started around the world, and the overall drive became the largest GoFundMe in history for an entertainment event, raising over $400,000.<ref name="DeadlineWknd1" /> Many celebrities offered their support and contributions to the drives,<ref name="GoFundMeRoots" /> including [[Ellen DeGeneres]], [[Snoop Dogg]], [[Chelsea Clinton]], [[J. J. Abrams]],<ref name="GoFundMeGuardian" /> [[Octavia Spencer]],<ref name="SpencerTheater" /> and British actress [[Jade Anouka]].<ref name="GoFundMeGuardian" />

In June 2018, the [[Smithsonian Institution]]'s [[National Museum of African American History and Culture]] announced they had acquired several items from the film for their collection, including Boseman's Black Panther costume and a shooting script for the film signed by Coogler, Feige, Moore, and Cole. The museum said that the collection provides a "fuller story of black culture and identity" by showing the progression of black Americans in film, "an industry that [once] regulated them to flat, one-dimensional and marginalized figures."<ref name="NMAAHCCollection" /> In conjunction with ''The Hollywood Reporter''{{'}}s Women in Entertainment Mentorship Program, and its partner the Greater Los Angeles chapter of [[Big Brothers Big Sisters of America|Big Brothers Big Sisters]], Walt Disney Studios created "The ''Black Panther'' Scholarship", worth {{USD}}250,000 to [[Loyola Marymount University]]. Boseman, Nyong'o, and Gurira presented the scholarship to its first recipient at ''The Hollywood Reporter''{{'}}s 2018 Women in Entertainment event in early December 2018.<ref name="BlackPantherScholarship" />

==== African and African-American representation ====
Dwayne Wong (Omowale) writing in ''[[HuffPost]]'' saw the film and its comic origins as addressing "serious political issues concerning Africa's relationship to the West that is very rarely given the serious attention that it deserves", with Wakandans portrayed as suspicious towards outsiders. He concluded that while the country is fictional, the politics "are very real. The end of [[colonialism]] did not end Western tampering in Africa's politics".<ref name="Omowale" /> Carlos Rosario Gonzalez of ''Bam! Smack! Pow!'' said the struggle between T'Challa and Killmonger represents the collision of "what it means to be African" and "what Africa means to Afro-minorities today". In this view, Wakanda represents Africa without Western colonialism, and Killmonger shows us that "we can sometimes inevitably become what we seek to destroy," concluding that Killmonger wants to use Wakanda's resources to become a colonizer of the West while "Wakanda's conservative ways created the very problem that sought to destroy them, Erik Killmonger".<ref name="Gonzalez" /> Jelani Cobb, writing in ''[[The New Yorker]]'', discussed the divide between Africans and African Americans, which he called a "fundamental dissonance". He felt T'Challa and Killmonger represented "dueling responses to five centuries of African exploitation at the hands of the West. The villain, to the extent that the term applies, is history itself". Cobb added that ''Black Panther'' is political in a way previous MCU films were not because in those "we were at least clear about where the lines of fantasy departed from reality [while this film is set in] in an invented nation in Africa, a continent that has been grappling with invented versions of itself ever since white men first declared it the 'dark continent' and set about plundering its people and its resources."<ref name="Cobb" /> Writing for ''[[The Atlantic (magazine)|The Atlantic]]'', [[Adam Serwer]] argued against the assertion that Erik Killmonger was a representation for black liberation, positing instead that he represented imperialism. He felt that this was emphasized through his actions, as Killmonger's attempts to take over several of the world's major cities notably include Hong Kong. Since China does not have a white Western hegemony in need of overthrowing, Killmonger's desire to conquer China was purely for the sake of power. Ultimately, he argues that "''Black Panther'' does not render a verdict that violence is an unacceptable tool of black liberationâto the contrary, that is precisely how Wakanda is liberated. It renders a verdict on imperialism as a tool of black liberation, to say that the master's tools cannot dismantle the master's house."<ref name="Serwer" />

[[Patrick Gathara]], writing in ''[[The Washington Post]]'', described the film as offering a "regressive, neocolonial vision of Africa", whichârather than a "redemptive counter-mythology"âoffers "the same destructive myths". Gathara highlighted the Africa that is portrayed, still essentially a European creation, as being divided and tribalized, with Wakanda run by a wealthy and feuding elite that despite its advanced technical abilities does not have a means of succession beyond lethal combat. The Wakandans "still cleanly fit into the Western molds [of] a dark people in a dark continent" according to Gathara, and they "remain so remarkably unsophisticated that a 'returning' American can basically stroll in and take over ... [The film] should not be mistaken for an attempt at liberating Africa from Europe. Quite the opposite. Its 'redemptive counter-mythology' entrenches the tropes that have been used to dehumanize Africans for centuries."<ref name="Gathara" /> Christopher Lebron, in a piece for ''[[Boston Review]]'', called the film racist because it depicts black Americans who had been left in poverty and oppression, as exemplified by Killmonger, as still being "relegated to the lowest rung of political regard" in the film, treated as less deserving of empathy and less capable of their acts being deemed heroic, than even Ross' white spy. Lebron felt that T'Challa could have shown himself a good person by understanding how Killmonger was affected by American racism and T'Chaka's "cruelty", and could have agreed that justice sometimes requires violence as a last resort against oppression. He summed up by commenting that "In 2018, a world home to both the [[Movement for Black Lives]] and a president <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[Donald Trump]]<nowiki>]</nowiki> who identifies white supremacists as fine people, we are given a movie about black empowerment where the only redeemed blacks are African nobles [who] safeguard virtue and goodness against the threat not of white Americans or Europeans, but a black American".<ref name="Lebron" />

Its nominations for the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]] and [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture â Drama]] were firsts for a superhero film,<ref name="OscarsBestPicture" /><ref name="GoldenGlobeSuperheroFilm" /> while its Academy Award wins were the first for Marvel Studios and an MCU film.<ref name="MCUFirstOscar" /> ''Black Panther'' was named one of the [[National Board of Review: Top Ten Films|ten best films of 2018]] by the [[National Board of Review]] as well as one of the [[American Film Institute Awards 2018|ten best films of 2018]] by the [[American Film Institute]].<ref name="NationalBoardTopTen" /><ref name="AFITopTen" /> The film was the top entertainment Google search of 2018 along with the sixth overall.<ref name="GoogleTop2018Searches" />

==== Oscars campaign ====
By late August 2018, Disney hired Academy Award campaign strategist Cynthia Swartz to create a nomination campaign on behalf of the film for the [[91st Academy Awards]], with Feige and Marvel Studios said to have given the film a noteworthy budget for the awards season, an obligation which Marvel didn't consider for previous films. The campaign was focused to highlight "the film's creative accomplishments and the global impact it made" in the hopes of receiving a Best Picture nomination; the campaign was not altered with the announcement of the new [[Academy Award for Outstanding Achievement in Popular Film|Best Popular Film]] award, which appeared to be "designed to reward blockbusters like ''Black Panther''" in the event they did not receive a best picture nomination.<ref name="OscarsCampaignLATimes" /> The Best Popular Film award was ultimately not implemented for the 91st Academy Awards, in order for the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] to "examine and seek additional input regarding" it.<ref name="NoPopularFilmAwardDeadline" /><ref name="NoPopularFilmAwardTHR" /> Glenn Whipp of the ''Los Angeles Times'' felt the "blueprint" for the film's best picture campaign was to "communicate to Oscar voters that this is an auteur-driven superhero movie possessing a deep significance both to its director and to people historically underrepresented in Hollywood films." Another Oscar campaign consultant felt reminding the Oscar voters ''Black Panther'' "wasn't just a movie, it was a phenomenon" would help the film earn a nomination. Another said voters "want to reward good movies and they also want to reward movies that say something significant and make the industry look good." The consultants also felt if ''Black Panther'' could earn multiple nominations in the craft award categories, it would bolster its chances for a best picture nomination; Whipp believed that Morrison, Beachler, Carter, Friend and Harlow, and Lamar all had the possibility to be nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography|Best Cinematography]], [[Academy Award for Best Production Design|Best Production Design]], [[Academy Award for Best Costume Design|Best Costume Design]], [[Academy Award for Best Makeup and Hairstyling|Best Makeup and Hairstyling]], and [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Best Original Song]], respectively.<ref name="OscarsCampaignLATimes" /> A few weeks later, Disney revealed their [[For Your Consideration (advertising)|For Your Consideration]] list, with consideration in all [[Academy Awards#Awards of Merit categories|Awards of Merit categories]], aside from [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] and categories it was not eligible for, such as those for animation, short films, and documentaries.<ref name="FYCListEW" /><ref name="FYCListJoBlo" />

''Black Panther'' was ultimately nominated for seven Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Costume Design, Best Production Design, [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]], Best Original Song (for "All the Stars"), [[Academy Award for Best Sound Editing|Best Sound Editing]], and [[Academy Award for Best Sound Mixing|Best Sound Mixing]].<ref name="Oscars2019" /> The film was the first superhero film ever to be nominated for Best Picture,<ref name="OscarsBestPicture" /> while Beachler's nomination for Best Production Design was the first for an African American.<ref name="OscarsProductionDesign" /> Feige called the best picture nomination "the highest form of recognition from our peers".<ref name="OscarsBestPicture" /> On her nomination, Beachler said she felt "a certain responsibility. It means breaking down walls ... for young women of color and boys and girls of color to see that this is not impossible."<ref name="OscarsProductionDesign" />

== Sequel ==
{{Further|List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films#Black Panther II (2022)}}
After ''Black Panther''{{'}}s release in February 2018, Feige said there were "many stories to tell" about the character, and that he wanted Coogler to return for any potential sequel.<ref name="FeigeFuture" /> Coogler said he wanted to see how Boseman's T'Challa would grow as a king in future films, since his reign only began recently in the MCU, while in the comics, he had been king since childhood.<ref name="ScreenRantFeb2018" /> In March 2018, Feige said there was "nothing specific to reveal" about a sequel, but there "absolutely" were "ideas and a pretty solid direction on where we want to head with the second one".<ref name="FeigeMar2018" /> By October 2018, Coogler had signed to write and direct a sequel to ''Black Panther'',<ref name="CooglerSequel" /> saying the next month that while he was feeling pressure in developing the sequel due to the first film's success, he would "focus on trying to make something that has some type of meaning" for the film.<ref name="CooglerSequel2" /> In mid-2019, Feige confirmed that work on the script had begun,<ref name="FeigeSequel" /> and that it was in development for release on May 6, 2022.<ref name="ScreenRant" /><ref name="D232019" /> Wright, Gurira, and Freeman are set to reprise their roles.<ref name="WrightSequel" /><ref name="GuriraSequel" /><ref name="FreemanSequel" /> In August 2020, following the death of Boseman from colon cancer, Coogler stated he had been unaware of Boseman's illness, and had "spent the last year preparing, imagining and writing words for him to say [in the film], that we weren't destined to see".<ref name="CooglerBosemanDeath" /> Feige and other executives at Marvel Studios involved on the ''Black Panther'' films were also unaware of Boseman's illness. Boseman, who had become thinner from his illness in the weeks prior to his death, had been prepared to begin gaining the weight back for the film in September 2020.<ref name="BP2ProductionBosemanDeath" /> In November 2020, Marvel Studios' head of production Victoria Alonso stated that a [[digital double]] of Boseman would not be created for the film and that Marvel would "think about what we're going to do next and how" in order to "honor the franchise".<ref name="AlonsoNov2020" /> Also in the month, Nyong'o, Duke, and Bassett were confirmed to be reprising their roles in the sequel, and [[Tenoch Huerta]] was in talks to appear in the film as an antagonist. Shuri was also said to have a more prominent role in the film. At that time, filming was expected to begin in July 2021 in Atlanta, Georgia.<ref name="THRNov2020Sequel" />

As for the film itself, 'It's a big geo-political action adventure that focuses on the family and royal struggle of T'Challa in Wakanda, and what it means to be a king. T'Challa's story is very important to us as it links to the next Avengers films, which is why we brought it forward.'}}</ref>
