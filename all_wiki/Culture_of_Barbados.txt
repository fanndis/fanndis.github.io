The '''culture of Barbados''' is a blend of West African and [[British culture]]s present in [[Barbados]].  English is the official language of the nation, reflecting centuries of British influence, but the [[Barbadian English|Bajan]] dialect in which it is spoken is an iconic part of the Barbadian culture. This dialect is a combination of the languages from the different inhabitants in its history.

== British influence ==

The island's British influence stretches back almost 400 years to 1625, when Captain John Powell claimed it in the name of [[James I of England|King James I]].  The first British colonists arrived two years later, founding a settlement of 80 civilians and 10 African [[slaves]].  From the start, Barbados adopted the British style of government, creating a [[Parliamentary democracy]] in 1639.  During the colonial period, all members of the Legislative Assembly were members of the elite-[[plantocracy]].

After Britain abolished slavery in 1838, non-whites quickly began to play a role in the island's government, with the first non-white member elected in 1843.

Barbados gained full political independence from Britain in 1966, but chose to retain its traditional parliamentary democracy governmental style and remains a member of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]].

The love of the sport of [[cricket]] continues to be reflected as an essential part of Barbados' culture.  The most popular sport in Barbados, its [[Barbadian cricket team|cricket team]] has won numerous regional titles.  Many players on the team go on to greater success on the [[West Indian cricket team|West Indies team]] to compete in international games.  One of the most highly regarded cricket players of all time, Sir [[Garfield Sobers]], is a Barbados native.

===Architecture===
The country's architecture pays further establishment testament to Britain, with many historic buildings still standing.  In addition to traditional wood and stone, coral was also used in construction, lending a unique Barbadian flair.  [[Jacobean architecture|Jacobean]], [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]], and [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] styles dominate.  But slaves constructed many of these buildings, as well as their own [[chattel house]]s, so they were an integral part of the island's architectural legacy.  Built of wood, chattel houses were set atop blocks instead of permanent foundations so they could be easily moved from place to place.  The vivid colours of these chattel houses show the West African influence.

==Culture==
=== Religion ===
{{main|Religion in Barbados}}

[[Religion]] plays a significant role in life on the island.  Up to 95% of the populace identifies itself as "[[Christians|Christian]]" (whether practicing or otherwise), and with its long British ties, the [[Anglican]] church comprises the largest segment of the population.<ref name=Bureau>U.S. Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor. [http://2001-2009.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2008/108513.htm International Religious Freedom Report 2008]. ''U.S. Department of State Archive''. 19 September 2008.</ref> However, [[Roman Catholic]], [[Baptist]], [[Methodist]], and other Christian denominations also support congregations.  The Christian population celebrates its deeply rooted faith in an annual festival, [[Gospelfest]].  
Smaller [[Judaism|Jewish]], [[Hinduism|Hindu]], and [[Islam|Muslim]] communities add some religious diversity. The [[Rastafarian]] faith also has its community of adherents, sometimes complaining of discrimination in schooling and employment.<ref name=Bureau/>

In addition to Gospelfest, Barbados holds many other carnivals and festivals.  The [[Landship (Barbados)|Landship]] is a Barbadian tradition.  It mimics and parodies the [[Royal Navy]], and incorporates music, dance and games.  The largest and most important festival in Barbados is [[Crop Over]], which celebrates the end of the [[sugarcane]] harvest.  Lasting three weeks, it includes fairs, parades, and contests.

=== Music ===
{{main|Music of Barbados}}
Music is an important part of the country's culture.  Modern [[Barbados]] has produced popular stars of [[calypso music|calypso]] and the indigenous [[spouge]] style, and also has a large [[jazz]] scene.  [[Reggae]], [[Soca music|soca]], and [[tuk band|tuk]] are popular as well.<ref name="Cameron2013">{{cite book|author=Sarah Cameron|title=Barbados Footprint Focus Guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZsP9AgAAQBAJ&pg=PA17|date=11 October 2013|publisher=Footprint Travel Guides|isbn=978-1-909268-32-6|pages=17–}}</ref>

The vast majority of contemporary Bajan calypso and soca music centers around the five-week [[Crop Over]] festival, whose events begin in late May and run throughout the summer, climaxing in the first week of August with the Grand Kadooment<ref>[http://www.barbados.org/cropclnd.htm Crop Over Calendar].
