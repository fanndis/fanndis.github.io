"'''Shallow'''" is a song by American singer [[Lady Gaga]] and American actor and filmmaker [[Bradley Cooper]]. It was released through [[Interscope Records]] on September 27, 2018 as the lead single from the [[A Star Is Born (2018 soundtrack)|soundtrack]] to the 2018 musical romantic drama film, ''[[A Star Is Born (2018 film)|A Star Is Born]]''. "Shallow" was written by Gaga with [[Andrew Wyatt]], [[Anthony Rossomando]] and [[Mark Ronson]], and produced by Gaga with Benjamin Rice. The song is heard three times throughout the film, most prominently during a sequence when Cooper's character Jackson Maine invites Gaga's character Ally to perform it onstage with him. The scene was filmed in front of a live audience at the [[Greek Theatre (Los Angeles)|Greek Theater]] in Los Angeles.

"Shallow" is a pivotal moment in ''A Star Is Born'', since it speaks about Ally and Jackson's conversations. Gaga wrote it from Ally's point of view with the self-aware lyrics asking each other if they are content being who they are. A [[Rock music|rock]] [[power ballad]],<ref name="Country" /> the song finds Gaga and Cooper trading verses and gradually moves towards the climactic final chorus with a vocal run by Gaga. The recording is interspersed with the sound of audience noise and applause. Gaga premiered it on DJ [[Zane Lowe]]'s [[Beats 1]] radio show while giving an interview about the film. An accompanying music video was also released, showing both Gaga's and Cooper's characters singing "Shallow" together onstage, interspersed with scenes from ''A Star Is Born''.

"Shallow" received acclaim from music critics, who commended Gaga's vocals, the dramatic nature of the composition and the songwriting. Commercially, the song topped the charts in more than twenty countries and reached the top ten elsewhere. It received numerous accolades, including the [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]], the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song]], the [[BAFTA Award for Best Film Music]] and the [[Critics' Choice Movie Award for Best Song]]. It garnered four [[Grammy Award]] nominations, including [[Grammy Award for Record of the Year|Record of the Year]] and [[Grammy Award for Song of the Year|Song of the Year]] while winning for [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Duo/Group Performance|Best Pop Duo/Group Performance]] and [[Grammy Award for Best Song Written for Visual Media|Best Song Written for Visual Media]].

Nelson used his own band, Promise of the Real, as Jackson's band. Inspired by [[Eric Clapton]], he added a short acoustic guitar intro at the beginning of "Shallow", feeling it would contrast with Gaga's loud belting which follows later in the song. Gaga went to [[EastWest Studios]] to help Nelson with the track and direct the band. He recalled that with some of the instrumentation, like the cymbal crashes, they "did that live in the studio based on the vision that we had".<ref name="thrill"/> As well as producing the track with Gaga, Benjamin Rice recorded it at EastWest and The Village West studios in Los Angeles, assisted by Bo Bodnar and Alex Williams. [[Tom Elmhirst]] mixed the song at [[Electric Lady Studios]] in New York City. It was engineered by Brandon Bost and mastered by Randy Merrill at [[Sterling Sound Studios]].<ref name="liner"/> Ronson also re-recorded a 1980s version of "Shallow", accompanied by big drums; it was used in the film during a sequence when Ally plays at The Forum, while Jackson kills himself.<ref name="latimesdeep"/>

Gaga described "Shallow" as a pivotal moment in ''A Star Is Born'', since it spoke about Ally and Jackson's conversations and their "need and drive" to go deep and move away from the shallow area in their relationship, an interpretation recognized by critics.<ref name="rs1">{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/lady-gaga-bradley-coopers-striking-star-is-born-duet-shallow-729894/|title=Watch Lady Gaga, Bradley Cooper Perform Striking 'A Star is Born' Duet 'Shallow'|last=Blistein|first=Jon|date=September 27, 2018|accessdate=October 11, 2018|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180928161330/https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/lady-gaga-bradley-coopers-striking-star-is-born-duet-shallow-729894/|archive-date=September 28, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="nymaghaa"/> The singer explained on Beats 1 they wrote the track from the point of view of Ally and how it became part of the reason they fall in love. "When I was writing music for the film I had to think about Ally as if she wasn't me. I went with a sound for her, even in the pop realm, that's unlike anything I've ever put out before," she clarified.<ref>{{cite AV media|url=https://itunes.apple.com/gb/post/sa.97e57b00-c85e-11e8-b365-469c36b70aa2|title=Watch 'Zane Lowe and Lady Gaga'|people=[[Zane Lowe|Lowe, Zane]] (host)|date=September 27, 2018|accessdate=October 11, 2018|medium=Radio show podcast|publisher=[[Beats 1]].

Initially, "Shallow" was an end credits song, but when the script changed it became a love song about Jackson and Ally. Seeing the first trailer for the film, Ronson decided not to refine the track anymore and kept it as the final mix. For Gaga, the conversational nature of the lyrics helped to set up Shallow's [[aria]], which she recorded with a [[falsetto]] voice. She also came up with the play on the song title "Shallow", "In the sha-ha, sha-ha-ha-low" lyrics.<ref name="latimesdeep"/>

Cooper opens the first verse by singing "Tell me something, girl" in a restrained voice; Gaga joins from the second verse, belting with what is described by Pitchfork as a "sturdy voice".<ref name="pitchforkreview"/> As the song moves gradually towards the final chorus the final vocal run has been described by Jon Blistein of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' as "chilling" with "impressive harmonizing" from both artists, accompanied by [[drum machine]] and pedal steel guitar.<ref name="rs1"/><ref name="pitchforkreview"/> Gaga sings a "roaring" vocal, harmonizing on the run "Haaa-ah-ah-ah, haaawaah, ha-ah-ah-aaah".

In an interview with ''[[Elle (magazine)|Elle]]'', Gaga discusses the song's impact and  states that "I really believe in my heart that the unfortunate truth is that our cell phones are becoming reality,” she said. "It's become reality for the world. And in this song we provide not just a conversation, but also a very poignant statement. I wish not to be in the shallow, but I am.
