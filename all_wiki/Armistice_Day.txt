'''Armistice Day''' is commemorated every year on 11 November to mark [[Armistice of 11 November 1918|the armistice]] signed between the [[Allies of World War I]] and [[German Empire|Germany]] at [[Compiègne]], [[French Third Republic|France]] at 5:45 am,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eyewitnesstohistory.com/armistice.htm|access-date=26 November 2018|title=Armistice: The End of World War I, 1918|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181126000847/http://www.eyewitnesstohistory.com/armistice.htm|archive-date=26 November 2018 |url-status=live |website=EyeWitness to History}}</ref> for the cessation of hostilities on the [[Western Front of World War I]], which took effect at eleven in the morning—the "eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month" of 1918. But, according to Thomas R. Gowenlock, an intelligence officer with the U.S. First Division, shelling from both sides continued for the rest of the day, ending only at nightfall.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.wearethemighty.com/articles/how-world-war-i-soldiers-celebrated-the-armistice |title=How World War I Soldiers Celebrated the Armistice|date=10 November 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Gowenlock |first1=Thomas |title=Soldiers of Darkness |date=1937 | publisher=Doubleday, Doran & Co. |oclc=1827765}}</ref> The armistice initially expired after a period of 36 days and had to be extended several times. A formal peace agreement was only reached when the [[Treaty of Versailles]] was signed the following year.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Shushkewich |first1=Val |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UDQ5kM_7ThkC&pg=PA42 |title=The real Winnie : a one-of-a-kind bear |year=2005 |publisher=Natural Heritage Books |isbn=978-1554883509 |page=42}}</ref>

The date is a national holiday in [[Public holidays in France|France]], and was declared a national holiday in many [[Allies of World War I|Allied nations]]. However, many Western countries and associated nations have since changed the name of the holiday from Armistice Day, with member states of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] adopting [[Remembrance Day]], and the United States government opting for [[Veterans Day]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/armistice-day-remembrance-day-and-veterans-day-whats-the-difference-a6730081.html|title=Armistice Day, Remembrance Day and Veterans Day – what's the difference?|first=Samuel|last=Osborne|date=11 November 2015|access-date=18 November 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181118032603/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/armistice-day-remembrance-day-and-veterans-day-whats-the-difference-a6730081.html|archive-date=18 November 2018 |url-status=live |newspaper=The Independent}}</ref> In some countries Armistice Day coincides with other public holidays.

On 11 November 2018, the [[First World War centenary|centenary]] of the World War One Armistice, commemorations were held globally. In France, more than 60 heads of government and heads of state gathered at the [[Arc de Triomphe]] in Paris.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/nov/11/armistice-day-people-gather-around-world-mark-centenary|title=People gather around world to mark armistice centenary|first=Esther|last=Addley|date=12 November 2018|access-date=18 November 2018|newspaper=The Guardian}}</ref>

== History in Allied countries ==
The first Armistice Day was held at [[Buckingham Palace]], commencing with King [[George V]] hosting a "Banquet in Honour of the President of the [[French Third Republic|French Republic]]"<ref>{{Royal Collection|1000799|Banquet in honour of The President of the French Republic, Monday 10 November 1919}}</ref> during the evening hours of 10 November 1919. The first official Armistice Day events were subsequently held in the grounds of Buckingham Palace on the morning of 11 November 1919,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/armistice-day-remembrance-day-and-veterans-day-whats-the-difference-a6730081.html|title=Armistice Day, Remembrance Day and Veterans Day – what's the difference?|first=Samuel|last=Osborne|date=11 November 2015|access-date=20 November 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181118032603/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/armistice-day-remembrance-day-and-veterans-day-whats-the-difference-a6730081.html|archive-date=18 November 2018 |url-status=live |newspaper=The Independent}}</ref> which included a [[two-minute silence]] as a mark of respect for those who died in the war and those left behind.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.churchtimes.co.uk/articles/2014/7-november/features/features/the-great-silence-begins|title=The great silence begins|first=Peter|last=Street|date=7 November 2014|access-date=20 November 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181117033727/https://www.churchtimes.co.uk/articles/2014/7-november/features/features/the-great-silence-begins|archive-date=17 November 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref> 

Similar ceremonies developed in other countries during the [[inter-war period]].
In South Africa, for example, the [[Memorable Order of Tin Hats]] had by the late 1920s developed a ceremony whereby the toast of "Fallen Comrades" was observed not only in silence but darkness, all except for the "Light of Remembrance", with the ceremony ending with the Order's anthem "Old Soldiers Never Die".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://muhaz.org/revielle-shellhole.html|title=Reveille Shellhole|pages=1–4|access-date=20 November 2018|archive-date=20 November 2018 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181120035547/http://muhaz.org/revielle-shellhole.html}}</ref>{{#tag:ref|Some sources report (all in identical words) that the [[South Australia]]n State Branch of the [[Returned and Services League of Australia|Returned Sailors & Soldiers' Imperial League of Australia]] developed a simple ceremony of silence for departed comrades at 9&nbsp;p.m., but there is no reliable source confirming that this happened on Armistice Day. The Club Palm Beach (formerly Palm Beach RSL) reports that a silence was observed in Adelaide in 1916 to mark the landing at Gallipoli.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://clubpalmbeach.com.au/club-history/|title=ANZAC Day history|access-date=20 November 2018}}</ref>|group=Note}}

In Britain, beginning in 1939, the two-minute silence was moved to the Sunday nearest to 11 November in order not to interfere with wartime production should 11 November fall on a weekday.<ref>{{cite book |last=Cecil |first=Hugh |date=1998 |title=At the Eleventh Hour |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y-CXAwAAQBAJ |publisher=Pen & Sword Books Ltd |pages=357–358|isbn=978-0850526448 }}</ref> This became [[Remembrance Sunday]].

After the end of [[World War II]], most member states of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]],  followed the earlier example of Canada and adopted the name [[Remembrance Day]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/armistice-day-remembrance-day-and-veterans-day-whats-the-difference-a6730081.html|title=Armistice Day, Remembrance Day and Veterans Day – what's the difference?|first=Samuel|last=Osborne|date=11 November 2015|access-date=18 November 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181118032603/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/armistice-day-remembrance-day-and-veterans-day-whats-the-difference-a6730081.html|archive-date=18 November 2018 |url-status=live |newspaper=The Independent}}</ref>

Other countries also changed the name of the holiday just prior to or after World War II, to honour veterans of that and subsequent conflicts. The United States chose [[Veterans Day|All Veterans Day]], later shortened to 'Veterans Day', to explicitly honour military veterans, including those participating in other conflicts.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.va.gov/opa/vetsday/vetdayhistory.asp |title=History of Veterans Day |date=20 July 2015 |website=U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs |access-date=2 November 2020}}</ref>

In the United Kingdom and Commonwealth countries, both Remembrance Day and [[Remembrance Sunday]] are commemorated formally, but are not public holidays. The [[National Service of Remembrance]] is held in London on Remembrance Sunday.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}

In the United States, [[Veterans Day]] honours American veterans, both living and deceased. The official [[national remembrance]] of those killed in action is [[Memorial Day]], which predates World War I. Some, including American novelist Kurt Vonnegut and American [[Veterans For Peace|Veteran For Peace]] Rory Fanning, have urged Americans to resume observation of 11 November as Armistice Day, a day to reflect on how we can achieve peace as it was originally observed.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/nov/11/us-observe-armistice-day-more-comfortable-war-than-peace|title=Why doesn't the US observe Armistice Day?

In [[Poland]], [[National Independence Day (Poland)|National Independence Day]] is a public holiday, celebrated on 11 November to commemorate the anniversary of the restoration of Poland's sovereignty as the [[Second Polish Republic]] in 1918, after 123 years of [[Partitions of Poland|partition]] by the [[Russian Empire]], the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] and the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire|Habsburg Empire]].<ref>[[Dziennik Ustaw]] [http://prawo.sejm.gov.pl/isap.nsf/DocDetails.xsp?id=WDU19370330255 1937 No. 33 position 255], [http://prawo.sejm.gov.pl/isap.nsf/DocDetails.xsp?id=WDU19890060034 1989 No. 6 position 34]</ref>

"Armistice Day" remains the name of the holiday in France ("Armistice de la Première Guerre mondiale")<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.holidayscalendar.com/event/armistice-day-in-france/|title=Armistice de 1918|access-date=18 November 2018}}</ref> and [[Belgium]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://publicholidays.be/armistice-day/|title=Public holidays global: Armistice Day|access-date=18 November 2018}}</ref>

It has been a statutory holiday in [[Serbia]] since 2012. Serbia is an Allied force that suffered [[World War I casualties|the largest casualty rate in World War I]]. To commemorate their victims, people in Serbia wear [[Ramonda nathaliae|Natalie's ramonda]] as a symbol of remembrance.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.b92.net/eng/news/society.php?yyyy=2012&mm=11&dd=09&nav_id=83083|title=Serbia to mark Armistice Day as state holiday|date=9 November 2012|access-date=18 November 2018}}</ref>

Ceremonies are held in [[Kenya]] over the weekend two weeks after Armistice Day. This is because news of the armistice only reached African forces, the [[King's African Rifles]], still fighting with great success in today's [[Zambia]] about a fortnight later, where the German and British commanders then had to agree on the protocols for their own armistice ceremony.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-46329241|title=Where World War One finally ended|access-date=26 November 2018|archive-date=26 November 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181126003302/https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-46329241|date=25 November 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref>
