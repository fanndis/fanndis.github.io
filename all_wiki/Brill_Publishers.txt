==History==
===Luchtmans, 1683–1848===
The roots of Brill go back to 17 May 1683, when the Leiden booksellers' guild registered Jordaan Luchtmans as a bookseller.<ref>Sytze van der Veen, ''Brill: 325 Years of Scholarly Publishing'' (Leiden: Brill, 2008), {{ISBN|978-90-04-17032-2}}), p. 11.</ref> As was customary at the time, Luchtmans combined his bookselling business with publishing,  primarily in the fields of biblical studies, theology, Asian languages, and ethnography. Luchtmans established close ties with the [[University of Leiden]], which was then a major center of study in these areas.

===E. J. Brill, 1848–1896===
[[File:EJBrill.jpg|thumb|E. J. Brill (''{{lang|de|Collection Deutsches Buch- und Schriftmuseum}}'')]]

In 1848, the business passed from the Luchtmans family to former employee E. J. (Evert Jan) Brill. In order to cover the financial obligations that he inherited, E. J. Brill liquidated the entire Luchtmans book stock in a series of auctions that took place between 1848 and 1850.<ref>van der Veen, 45.</ref> Brill continued to publish in the traditional core areas of the company, with occasional excursions into other fields. Thus, in 1882, the firm brought out a two-volume ''{{lang|nl|Leerboek der Stoomwerktuigkunde}}'' ("Handbook of Steam Engineering"). More programmatically, however, in 1855 ''{{lang|nl|Het Gebed des Heeren in veertien talen}}'' ("The Lord's Prayer in Fourteen Languages") was meant to publicize Brill's ability to typeset non-Latin alphabets, including Hebrew, Aramaic, Samaritan, Sanskrit, Coptic, Syriac, and Arabic, among others.<ref>van der Veen, 51.</ref>

===Brill goes public, 1896–1945; World War II===
In 1896, Brill became a public limited company, when E. J. Brill's successors, A. P. M. van Oordt and Frans de Stoppelaar, both businessmen with some academic background and interest, died. A series of directors followed, until Theunis Folkers took over the reins in 1934.<ref name=onehundredeight>van der Veen, 108.</ref>  At the time, the annual turnover was 132,000 guilders.<ref name=onehundredthree>van der Veen, 103 and 109.</ref>  His directorship marked a period of unprecedented growth in the history of the company, due to a large extent to Folkers' cooperation with the German occupying forces during [[World War II]]. For the Germans, Brill printed foreign-language textbooks so that they could manage the territories they occupied, but also military manuals, such as "a manual which trained German officers to distinguish the insignias of the Russian army".<ref name=onehundredeight /> By 1943, the company's turnover had reached 579,000 guilders.<ref name=onehundredthree />

===Brill's recent history, 1945–present===
After the war, the Dutch [[denazification]] committee determined the presence of "enemy money" in Brill's accounts. Folkers was arrested in September 1946, and deprived of the right to hold a managerial post.<ref>van der Veen, 111.</ref> The company itself, however, escaped the aftermath of the war relatively unscathed; after some negotiation its fines were fixed at 57,000 guilders.<ref>van der Veen, 115.</ref>

Brill's path in the post-war years was again marked by ups and downs, though the company remained faithful in its commitment to scholarly publishing. The late 1980s brought an acute crisis due to over-expansion, poor management, as well as general changes in the publishing industry. Thus, in 1988–91 under new management the company underwent a major restructuring, in the course of which it closed some of its foreign offices, including Cologne. Its London branch was already closed by then. Brill, moreover, sold its printing business, which amounted "to amputat[ing] its own limb".<ref>van der Veen, 144.</ref> This was considered painful, but necessary to save the company as a whole. No jobs were lost in the process. The reorganization saved the company, which has since expanded. As of 2008, Brill was publishing around 600 books and 100 journals each year, with a turnover of 26 million euros.<ref>van der Veen, 153.</ref>

==Open access==
Brill publishes several [[open access]] journals<ref>{{cite web|url=https://brill.com/page/OpenAccess/open-access-at-brill|title=Open Access with Brill|work=brill.com}}</ref> and is one of thirteen publishers to participate in the [[Knowledge Unlatched]] pilot, a global library consortium approach to funding [[Open-access monograph|open access books]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.knowledgeunlatched.org/publishers/|title=KU Select For Publishers|work=knowledgeunlatched.org}}</ref>

In 2013, Brill created the IFLA/Brill Open Access Award for initiatives in the area of open access monograph publishing together with the [[International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.researchinformation.info/news/news_story.php?news_id=1081|title=Brill and IFLA announce new OA prize|work=researchinformation.info}}</ref>

Brill is a member of the [[Open Access Scholarly Publishers Association]].

==Brill Typeface==
Brill has developed a commercial font, free for personal use, that supports most of the Latin, Greek and Cyrillic character ranges, including IPA and historical forms. It has better diacritic rendering than most pre-packaged computer fonts, though not complete IPA coverage.<ref>[https://brill.com/page/1228?language=en Brill Typeface]</ref>
