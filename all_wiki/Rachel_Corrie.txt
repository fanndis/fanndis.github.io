The Israeli army conducted an investigation, which concluded that the death was an accident, and that the driver of the bulldozer could not see Corrie due to limited visibility from his cab.

==Early life==
Corrie was born on April 10, 1979, and raised in [[Olympia, Washington]], United States. She was the youngest of three children of Craig Corrie, an insurance executive, and Cindy Corrie. Cindy describes their family as "average Americans—politically liberal, economically conservative, middle class".<ref name="Banks">{{cite news |last=Banks |first=Gabrielle |date=December 2, 2005 |title=Parents speaking out to keep alive memory of child killed in Gaza |url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/05336/616048.stm |work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060204124721/http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/05336/616048.stm |archivedate=February 4, 2006 |accessdate=May 12, 2012}}</ref><ref name="Tizon">{{cite news |last1=Tizon |first1=Tomas Alex |last2=Marshall |first2=Lynn |date=March 18, 2003 |title=Activist Had Soft Spot for Underdogs |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2003/mar/18/nation/na-corrie18 |work=The Los Angeles Times |accessdate=December 12, 2008}}</ref><ref name="Twair"/>

After graduating from [[Capital High School (Washington)|Capital High School]], Corrie went on to attend [[The Evergreen State College]], also in Olympia, where she took a number of arts courses. She took a year off from her studies to work as a volunteer in the [[Civilian Conservation Corps#Washington Conservation Corps|Washington State Conservation Corps]]. According to the ISM, she spent three years making weekly visits to mental patients.<ref name="Twair">{{cite news |last1=Twair |first1=Pat |last2=Twair |first2=Samir |year=2003 |title=Hundreds Salute International Solidarity Movement, Rachel Corrie's Parents |work=[[Washington Report on Middle East Affairs]] |issn=8755-4917 |issue=July/August |pages=62–64 |url=http://www.wrmea.com/archives/july_aug2003/0307062.html}}</ref>

While at Evergreen State College she became a "committed peace activist"<ref name="BBC_profile"/> arranging peace events through a local pro-ISM group called "Olympians for Peace and Solidarity". She later joined the [[International Solidarity Movement]] (ISM) organisation in order to challenge the policies of the Israeli army in the [[West Bank]] and [[Gaza Strip]].<ref name="BBC_profile"/> In her senior year, she proposed an independent-study program in which she would travel to Gaza, join protesters from the ISM, and initiate a "sister city" project between Olympia and [[Rafah]].<ref name="Hammer-2003">{{cite news |last=Hammer |first=Joshua |date=September–October 2003 |title=The Death of Rachel Corrie |work=[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]] |url=https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2003/09/death-rachel-corrie |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171001113408/https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2003/09/death-rachel-corrie/ |archivedate=October 1, 2017 |url-status=live}}</ref> Before leaving, she also organized a [[pen-pal]] program between children in Olympia and Rafah.<ref name="Kleinp182">Klein (article of May 22, 2003), as republished in Flanders, 2004, p. 182.</ref>

==Activities in the Palestinian territories==

[[File:Rachel Corrie 2003 March 16 cropped.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Rachel Corrie stands before Israeli [[IDF Caterpillar D9]] bulldozers]]While in Rafah, Corrie stood in front of armored bulldozers, in an alleged attempt to impede [[House demolition in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict|house demolitions]] which the ISM claims were being carried out.<ref name="NYT">{{cite news |title=Israeli Army Bulldozer Kills American Protesting in Gaza |last=Myre |first=Greg |date=March 17, 2003 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/17/world/israeli-army-bulldozer-kills-american-protesting-in-gaza.html |work=The New York Times |accessdate=September 8, 2012}}</ref> Demolitions were a common tactic employed along the security road near the border between Israel and Egypt at Rafah to uncover explosive devices and destroy tunnels used by terrorists to smuggle weapons from Egypt to Gaza. These military operations were criticized as "[[collective punishment]]" by some human rights groups.<ref name="g20120828">{{cite news |last=Sherwood |first=Harriet |date=August 28, 2012 |title=Rachel Corrie lawsuit result 'dangerous precedent' say human rights groups |work=The Guardian |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/28/rachel-corrie-dismissal-dangerous-precedent}}</ref> Israel authorities said that demolitions were necessary because "Palestinian gunmen used the structures as cover to shoot at their troops patrolling in the area, or to conceal arms-smuggling tunnels under the [[Gaza–Egypt border|Gaza-Egypt border]]."<ref name="BBC_profile"/> Corrie was a member of a group of about eight activists from outside of the Palestinian territories who tried to prevent the Israeli army's activities by acting as [[human shield]]s.<ref name="g20120828"/>

On Corrie's first night there, she and two other ISM members set up camp inside Block J, which the ISM described as "a densely populated neighborhood along the Pink Line and frequent target of gunfire from an Israeli watchtower". By situating themselves visibly between the Palestinians and the Israeli [[sniper]]s manning the watchtowers they hoped to discourage shooting by displaying banners stating that they were "internationals". When Israeli soldiers fired warning shots, Corrie and her colleagues dismantled their tent and left the area.<ref name="Hammer-2003"/>

Qishta, a Palestinian who worked as an [[Language interpretation|interpreter]], noted: "Late January and February was a very crazy time. There were house demolitions taking place all over the border strip and the activists had no time to do anything else."<ref name="Hammer-2003"/> Qishta also stated of the ISM activists: "They were not only brave; they were crazy."<ref name="Hammer-2003"/> The safety of the protestors was frequently jeopardized by these confrontations— a British participant was wounded by [[Shrapnel (fragment)|shrapnel]] while retrieving the body of a Palestinian man killed by a sniper, and an Irish ISM activist had a close encounter with an armored bulldozer.<ref name="Hammer-2003"/>

[[Palestinian political violence|Palestinian militants]] expressed concern that the "internationals" staying in tents between the Israeli [[watchtower]]s and the residential neighborhoods would get caught in [[crossfire]], while other residents were concerned that the activists might be [[Espionage|spies]]. To overcome this suspicion Corrie learned a few words of [[Arabic]] and participated in a mock trial denouncing the "crimes of the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush Administration]]".<ref name="Hammer-2003"/> While the ISM members were eventually provided with food and housing, a letter was circulated in Rafah that cast suspicion on them."Who are they? Why are they here? Who asked them to come here?"<ref name="Hammer-2003"/> On the morning of Corrie's death they planned to counteract the letter's effects. According to one of them, "We all had a feeling that our role was too passive. We talked about how to engage the Israeli military."<ref name="Hammer-2003"/>

===Water well protecting efforts===
According to a January 2003 article by Gordon Murray, a fellow ISM activist, in the last month of her life Corrie "spent a lot of time at the Canada Well helping protect Rafah [[municipal]] workers" who were trying to repair damage to the well done by Israeli bulldozers. Canada Well was built in 1999 with [[Canadian International Development Agency|CIDA]] funding. It, along with El Iskan Well, had supplied more than 50% of Rafah's water before the damage. The city had been under "strict rationing (only a few hours of running water on alternate days)" since. Murray writes that ISM activists were maintaining a presence there since "Israeli snipers and tanks routinely shot at civilian workers trying to repair the wells." In one of her reports, Corrie wrote that despite her group's having received permission from the Israeli District Command Office and the fact that they were carrying "banners and [[megaphone]]s the activists and workers were fired upon several times over a period of about one hour. One of the bullets came within two metres of three internationals and a municipal water worker close enough to spray bits of debris in their faces as it landed at their feet."<ref name="racheloverview">{{cite web |last=Corrie |first=Rachel |date=February 28, 2003 |url=http://www.pchrgaza.org/images/2003/rachel/overwrite.htm |title=Overview of events in Gaza since Feb 14th |publisher=Palestinian Centre for Human Rights |accessdate=September 8, 2012}}</ref>

===Controversy over protest against the Iraq War===
While in Gaza, Corrie took part in a demonstration as part of the [[February 15, 2003 anti-war protest]] against the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|invasion of Iraq]]. She was photographed burning a makeshift U.S. flag.<ref name="Hammer-2003"/><ref name="cbc.ca 2006">{{cite news |title='Rachel Corrie' play opens in London after NYC cancellation |url=http://www.cbc.ca/arts/story/2006/03/31/rachelcorrie-london.html |work=CBC News |date=March 31, 2006 |archivedate=June 20, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080620112341/http://www.cbc.ca/arts/story/2006/03/31/rachelcorrie-london.html |accessdate=September 8, 2012}} See photo of burning of mock flag attached to article.</ref> [[Robert Spencer (author)|Robert Spencer]] criticized Corrie for having burned the flag in front of children, writing that she was "fostering ... hatred" of the United States.<ref name="Onward Muslim Soldiers">{{cite book |last=Spencer |first=Robert |year=2003 |title=Onward Muslim Soldiers: How Jihad Still Threatens America and the West |publisher=Regnery Publishing |page=[https://archive.org/details/onwardmuslimsold00spen_0/page/285 285] |isbn=978-0-89526-100-7 |url=https://archive.org/details/onwardmuslimsold00spen_0/page/285 }}</ref>

After her death the ISM released a statement quoting Corrie's parents on the widely circulated picture of the incident:

<blockquote>In the words of Rachel's parents: "The act, while we may disagree with it, must be put into context. Rachel was partaking in a demonstration in Gaza opposing the War on Iraq. She was working with children who drew two pictures, one of the American flag, and one of the Israeli flag, for burning. Rachel said that she could not bring herself to burn the picture of the Israeli flag with the Star of David on it, but under such circumstances, in protest over a drive towards war and her government's foreign policy that was responsible for much of the devastation that she was witness to in Gaza, she felt it OK to burn the picture of her own flag. We have seen photographs of memorials held in Gaza after Rachel's death in which Palestinian children and adults honor our daughter by carrying a mock coffin draped with the American flag. We have been told that our flag has never been treated so respectfully in Gaza in recent years. We believe Rachel brought a different face of the United States to the Palestinian people, a face of compassion. It is this image of Rachel with the American flag that we hope will be remembered most.<ref>{{cite press release |title=ISM Statement on the Killing of Rachel Corrie and its Aftermath |url=http://www.rachelcorrie.org/ism.htm |publisher=Rachel Corrie Memorial Website |date=March 21, 2003 |accessdate=September 9, 2012}}</ref></blockquote>

Rachel Corrie sent a series of emails to her mother while she was in Gaza, four of which were later published by ''[[The Guardian]]''.<ref name="guardiansletters">{{cite news |title=Rachel's War |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/mar/18/usa.israel |work=The Guardian |date=March 17, 2003 |accessdate=May 8, 2008}}</ref> In January 2008, [[W.

==Death and subsequent controversy==
On March 16, 2003, the IDF was engaged in an operation involving the demolition of Palestinian houses in Rafah.<ref name="Haaretz American peace activist">{{cite news |title=American peace activist killed by army bulldozer in Rafah |url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/american-peace-activist-killed-by-army-bulldozer-in-rafah-1.16010|work=Haaretz |date=March 17, 2003 |accessdate=May 8, 2008}}</ref> Corrie was part of a group of three British and four American ISM activists attempting to disrupt the IDF operation. Corrie placed herself in the path of a [[IDF Caterpillar D9|Caterpillar D9R]] [[armored bulldozer]] in the area and was run over by the bulldozer and fatally injured. After she was injured she was taken by a [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|Red Crescent]] ambulance to the Palestinian Najar hospital, arriving at the emergency room at 5:05 pm,  still alive but near death. At 5:20 pm she was declared dead.<ref name="struggle for justice">{{cite news |title=Rachel Corrie death: struggle for justice culminates in Israeli court |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/27/rachel-corrie-death-israel-verdict?INTCMP=ILCNETTXT3487 |work=The Guardian |date=August 27, 2012 |accessdate=August 31, 2012}}</ref>

The events surrounding Corrie's death are disputed. Fellow ISM activists said that the soldier operating the bulldozer deliberately ran Corrie over while she was acting as a human shield to prevent the [[House demolition in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict|demolition of the home]] of local pharmacist Samir Nasrallah.<ref name="edition.cnn.com"/><ref name="Hammer-2003"/><ref>{{cite news |title=Israel calls Corrie death 'accident' |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/3025016.stm |work=BBC News |date=June 27, 2003 |accessdate=September 8, 2012}}</ref> They said she was between the bulldozer and a wall near Nasrallah's home, in which ISM activists had spent the night several times.<ref name="Hammer-2003"/> Israeli eyewitnesses maintain that the death was accidental because the bulldozer operator was unable to see Corrie due to the vehicle's obstructed view. Furthermore, Israeli witnesses maintain that Corrie was not defending a house from being demolished and was instead inhibiting a military operation to find contraband weapons and smuggling tunnels in Gaza. An IDF officer testified in court that on that day they were only clearing vegetation and rubble from houses that were previously demolished, and that no new houses were slated for demolition.<ref name="haaretz1">{{cite news |title=IDF officer: U.S. activist ignored warnings before crushed by bulldozer |agency=Associated Press |url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/idf-officer-u-s-activist-ignored-warnings-before-crushed-by-bulldozer-1.353891 |work=Haaretz |date=April 3, 2011 |accessdate=September 8, 2012}}</ref>

The major points of dispute are whether the bulldozer operator saw Corrie and whether her injuries were caused by being crushed under the blade or by the mound of debris the bulldozer was pushing. An IDF spokesman has acknowledged that Israeli army regulations normally require that the operators of the [[armored personnel carrier]]s (APCs) that accompany bulldozers are responsible for directing the operators towards their targets because the [[Armored bulldozer|Caterpillar D9]] [[bulldozer]]s have a restricted field of vision with several blind spots.<ref name="makingofmartyr">{{cite news |last=Jordan |first=Sandra |date=March 22, 2003 |title=Making of a martyr |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/mar/23/internationaleducationnews.students |work=The Observer |accessdate=May 8, 2008}}</ref><ref name="pile">{{cite news |title=Activists: Death was no accident; Arafat offers condolences |agency=Associated Press |url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=20030317&slug=protester17m |work=The Seattle Times |date=March 17, 2003 |accessdate=September 8, 2012}}</ref>

===ISM accounts===
ISM activist Richard Purssell testified, "[t]hey began demolishing one house. We gathered around and called out to them and went into the house, so they backed out. During the entire time they knew who we were and what we were doing, because they didn't shoot at us. We stood in their way and shouted. There were about eight of us in an area about 70 square meters. Suddenly, we saw they turned to a house they had started to demolish before, and I saw Rachel standing in the way of the front bulldozer." Human-rights activists and Palestinians say that the demolitions had also been accompanied by gunfire from Israeli snipers. The director of Rafah's hospital, Dr. Ali Moussa said that 240 Palestinians, including 78 children, had been killed since the Al-Aqsa Intifada began in 2001, "Every night there is shooting at houses in which children are sleeping, without any attacks from Palestinians."<ref name="Hammer-2003"/> The United Nations said that 582 Rafah homes were demolished and 721 damaged, with 5,305 people made homeless.<ref name="Hammer-2003"/>

An ISM activist using the name "Richard", saying he had witnessed Corrie's death, told ''[[Haaretz]]'':

<blockquote>There's no way he didn't see her, since she was practically looking into the cabin. At one stage, he turned around toward the building. The bulldozer kept moving, and she slipped and fell off the plow. But the bulldozer kept moving, the shovel above her. I guess it was about 10 or 15 meters that it dragged her and for some reason didn't stop. We shouted like crazy to the operator through loudspeakers that he should stop, but he just kept going and didn't lift the shovel. Then it stopped and backed up. We ran to Rachel. She was still breathing.<ref name="Haaretz American peace activist"/></blockquote>

Eyewitness and ISM member Tom Dale, commenting on the 2012 verdict said: "Whatever one thinks about the visibility from a D9 bulldozer, it is inconceivable that at some point the driver did not see her, given the distance from which he approached, while she stood, unmoving, in front of it. As I told the court, just before she was crushed, Rachel briefly stood on top of the rolling mound of earth which had gathered in front of the bulldozer: her head was above the level of the blade, and just a few meters from the driver."<ref name="Mackey">{{cite news |last=Mackey |first=Robert |work=The New York Times |title=Witness to Rachel Corrie's Death Responds to Israeli Court Ruling Absolving Soldier |url=http://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/08/28/witness-to-rachel-corries-death-responds-to-israeli-court-ruling-absolving-soldier/ |date=August 28, 2012 |accessdate=September 7, 2012}}</ref>

Joe Carr, an American ISM activist who used the assumed name of Joseph Smith during his time in Gaza, gave the following account in an affidavit recorded and published by the [[Palestinian Centre for Human Rights]] (PCHR):
[[File:Rachel Corrie crushed by bulldozer.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Corrie in the aftermath of the incident]]

<blockquote>Still wearing her fluorescent jacket, she knelt down at least 15 meters in front of the bulldozer, and began waving her arms and shouting, just as activists had successfully done dozens of times that day.... When it got so close that it was moving the earth beneath her, she climbed onto the pile of rubble being pushed by the bulldozer.... Her head and upper torso were above the bulldozer's blade, and the bulldozer operator and co-operator could clearly see her. Despite this, the operator continued forward, which caused her to fall back, out of view of the driver.{{sic}} He continued forward, and she tried to scoot back, but was quickly pulled underneath the bulldozer. We ran towards him, and waved our arms and shouted; one activist with the megaphone.

On March 18, 2003, two days after Corrie's death, Joe (Smith) Carr was interviewed by British [[Channel 4]] and ''[[The Observer]]'' reporter [[Sandra Jordan]] for a documentary, ''The Killing Zone'', which aired in June 2003. He stated, "It was either a really gross mistake or a really brutal murder."<ref>{{cite video |people=Eamonn Matthews (executive producer), Rodrigo Vazquez (director and cinematographer) |year=2003 |title=Dispatches: The Killing Zone |url=http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=5863204188744026936 |publisher=Mentorn Midlands |accessdate=September 9, 2012}} Joe (Smith) Carr's remarks occur at 9:50 into the documentary.</ref>

According to ''[[The Seattle Times]]'', "Smith, who witnessed Sunday's incident, said it began when Corrie sat down in front of the bulldozer. He said the operator scooped her up with a pile of earth, dumped her on the ground and ran over her twice."<ref name="pile"/>

However, "Smith" later acknowledged that after Corrie fell down the dirt pile, the bulldozer operator could well have lost sight of Corrie.<ref name="Hammer-2003"/>

===Israeli accounts===
The bulldozer operator, a Russian immigrant to Israel, was interviewed on Israeli TV and insisted he had no idea she was in front of him:
<blockquote>You can't hear, you can't see well. You can go over something and you'll never know. I scooped up some earth, I couldn't see anything. I pushed the earth, and I didn't see her at all. Maybe she was hiding in there.<ref name="Hammer-2003"/></blockquote>

The IDF produced a video about Corrie's death that includes footage taken from inside the cockpit of a [[Armored bulldozer|D9]]. The video makes a "credible case", wrote [[Joshua Hammer]] in ''[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]],'' that "the operators, peering out through narrow, double-glazed, bulletproof windows, their view obscured behind pistons and the giant scooper, might not have seen Corrie kneeling in front of them".<ref name="Hammer-2003"/>

In April 2011, during the trial of the civil suit brought by Corrie's parents, an IDF officer testified that Corrie and other activists had spent hours trying to block the bulldozers under his command. He went on to say that it was a war zone "where Palestinian militants used abandoned homes as firing positions and exploited foreign activists for cover". He shouted over a [[megaphone]] for the activists to leave, tried to use tear gas to disperse them and moved his troops several times. "To my regret, after the eighth time, (Corrie) hid behind an earth embankment. The D9 operator didn't see her. She thought he saw her," he said.<ref name="haaretz1"/>

An infantry major later testified that the activists were endangering troops and had ignored numerous warnings to leave the area. Between September 2000 and the date of Corrie's death Israeli forces in the area had been subjected to 1,400 attacks involving gunfire, 150 involving explosive devices, 200 involving anti-tank rockets, and 6,000 involving hand grenades or mortar fire.<ref name="Times of Israel Court dismisses" />

===Autopsy===
[[Prime Minister of Israel]] [[Ariel Sharon]] promised President Bush a "thorough, credible, and transparent investigation".<ref name="Hammer-2003"/> Later, Capt. Jacob Dallal, a spokesman for the Israeli army, called Corrie's death a "regrettable accident" and said that she and the other ISM activists were "a group of protesters who were acting very irresponsibly, putting everyone in danger—the Palestinians, themselves and our forces—by intentionally placing themselves in a combat zone".

An autopsy was conducted on March 24 at the [[Abu Kabir Forensic Institute]] in [[Tel Aviv]] by Chief Pathologist [[Yehuda Hiss]]. The final report was not released publicly, but in their report on the matter [[Human Rights Watch]] says a copy was provided to them by Craig Corrie, with a translation supplied by the [[United States Department of State|U.S. Department of State]]. In the report they quote Hiss as concluding, "Her death was caused by pressure on the chest (mechanical [[asphyxiation]]) with [[bone fracture|fractures]] of the ribs and [[vertebrae]] of the [[Anatomical terms of location|dorsal]] [[spinal column]] and [[scapula]]s, and tear wounds in the right lung with [[hemorrhaging]] of the [[pleural cavities]]."<ref name="note">{{cite web|url=http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/country,,HRW,COUNTRYREP,ISR,4562d8cf2,42c3bd100,0.html |title=Promoting Impunity: The Israeli Military's Failure to Investigate Wrongdoing |date=June 22, 2005 |publisher=Human Rights Watch |accessdate=September 8, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121007051215/http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/country%2C%2CHRW%2CCOUNTRYREP%2CISR%2C4562d8cf2%2C42c3bd100%2C0.html |archivedate=October 7, 2012 }}</ref>

===Military investigation===
[[File:D9R rpg-armor06a.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Bulldozer similar to the one involved]]
The Israeli army's report [seen by ''[[The Guardian]]''], said:

{{quote|The army was searching for explosives in the border zone when Corrie was "struck as she stood behind a mound of earth that was created by an engineering vehicle operating in the area and she was hidden from the view of the vehicle's operator who continued with his work. Corrie was struck by dirt and a slab of concrete resulting in her death.... The finding of the operational investigations shows that Rachel Corrie was not run over by an engineering vehicle but rather was struck by a hard object, most probably a slab of concrete which was moved or slid down while the mound of earth which she was standing behind was moved.|''The Guardian'', April 14, 2003.<ref name="Urquart-Report-Clears-Troops" />}}

On June 26, 2003, ''[[The Jerusalem Post]]'' quoted an Israeli military spokesman as saying that Corrie had not been run over and that the operator had not seen her:
<blockquote>The driver at no point saw or heard Corrie. She was standing behind debris which obstructed the view of the driver and the driver had a very limited field of vision due to the protective cage he was working in.... The driver and his commanders were interrogated extensively over a long period of time with the use of polygraph tests and video evidence. They had no knowledge that she was standing in the path of the tractor. An autopsy of Corrie's body revealed that the cause of death was from falling debris and not from the tractor physically rolling over her. It was a tragic accident that never should have happened.</blockquote>

The classified IDF report made no mention of the [[pathologist]]'s conclusion.<ref>Greg Barrett. Autopsy, military investigation differ on how activist died. Gannett News Service. June 11, 2003.</ref>

Howard Blume told that IDF stated:

<blockquote>[a bulldozer with 2 crews] was engaged in "routine terrain leveling and debris clearing", not building demolition. Quoting from the IDF report, Corrie died "as a result of injuries sustained when earth and debris accidentally fell on her.... Ms. Corrie was not run over by the bulldozer," he added, IDF also claimed she was possibly "in a [[Blind spot (vehicle)|blindspot]] for the bulldozer operators and "behind an earth mound", so they did not see that she was in harm's way.<ref name="JJ">{{cite news |last=Blume |first=Howard |date=June 23, 2005 |title=Two Families' Dreams Were Not Demolished |url=http://www.jewishjournal.com/community_briefs/article/two_families_dreams_were_not_demolished_20050624/ |work=Jewish Journal |accessdate=September 8, 2012}}</ref></blockquote>

In later IDF operations, the house was damaged (a hole was knocked in a wall) and was later destroyed. By that time, the Nasrallah family had moved into a different house. It was reported in 2006 that the house that Corrie was trying to protect was rebuilt with funds raised by [[The Rebuilding Alliance]].{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

A spokesman for the IDF told the ''Guardian'' that, while it did not accept responsibility for Corrie's death, it intended to change its operational procedures to avoid similar incidents in the future. The level of command of similar operations would be raised, said the spokesman, and civilians in the area would be dispersed or arrested before operations began. Observers will be deployed and [[Closed-circuit television|CCTV]] cameras will be installed on the bulldozers to compensate for blind spots, which may have contributed to Corrie's death.

The IDF gave copies of the report, titled "The Death of Rachel Corrie", to members of the U.S. Congress in April 2003, and Corrie's family released the document to the media in June 2003, according to the Gannett News Service.<ref>[http://www.theolympian.com/home/news/20030614/frontpage/28005.shtml ]{{dead link|date=July 2010}}</ref> In March 2004 the family said that the entire report had not been released, and that only they and two American staffers at the [[Diplomatic missions of the United States|U.S. Embassy in Tel Aviv]] had been allowed to view it.

Corrie's father, Craig Corrie has said "I know there's stuff you can't see out of the double glass windows." But he has denied that as a valid excuse, saying "you're responsible for knowing what's in front of your blade... It's a no brainer that this was gross negligence".

In 2005, [[Human Rights Watch]] published a report raising questions about the impartiality and professionalism of the IDF investigation. Some of the problems that the report mentioned were the investigators' lack of preparation, the "hostile," "inappropriate," and "mostly accusatory" questions they asked witnesses, the failure to ask witnesses to draw maps or to identify locations of events on maps, and their lack of interest in reconciling soldiers' testimonies with those of other eyewitnesses.<ref name="note"/>

===Media===
[[Image:Rachelcorriememorial03-18-03.JPG|thumb|150px|right|Rachel Corrie memorial vigil at Israeli Embassy in Washington, DC March 18, 2003]]

''[[The Observer]]'' suggested that because Corrie was American her death attracted more attention than the deaths of Palestinians under similar circumstances: "On the night of Corrie's death, nine Palestinians were killed in the Gaza Strip, among them a four-year-old girl and a man aged 90. A total of 220 people have died in Rafah since the beginning of the intifada. Palestinians know the death of one American receives more attention than the killing of hundreds of Muslims."<ref name="makingofmartyr"/>

In 2006, ''[[Haaretz]]'' political columnist [[Bradley Burston]] said that Corrie's death was accidental but that "incidental killing is no less tragic than intentional killing"; Burston criticized both the pro-Palestinian and pro-Israeli sides for their excessive rhetoric:

<blockquote>Of all of the tragedies and casualties of the intifada, in which more than 4,000 people were killed over five years, the case of Rachel Corrie still stands apart, the subject of intense world interest and fierce debate.... Part of it starts with us. ''"They had no business being there"'' is no excuse for what the [[The Pentagon|Pentagon]] long ago christened [[collateral damage]]. We've learned much. But we're still not there. We should have saved Rachel Corrie's life that day, either by sending out a spotter or delaying the bulldozer's work. Right now, somewhere in the West Bank, there's an eight-year-old whose life could be saved next week, if we've managed to learn the lesson and are resourceful enough to know how to apply it.<ref name="Burston">{{cite news |last=Burston |first=Bradley |date=March 17, 2006 |title=Who remembers Rachel Corrie? |work=[[Haaretz]] |url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/pages/ShArt.jhtml?itemNo=695210&contrassID=2 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070423162925/http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/pages/ShArt.jhtml?itemNo=695210&contrassID=2 |archivedate=April 23, 2007 |accessdate=May 12, 2012}}</ref></blockquote>

American journalist [[Charlie Wolf]] referred to Corrie as "scum" on his show on British radio station [[talkSPORT]].

===Criticism of Corrie's actions===
[[Tom Gross]], in an article called "The Forgotten Rachels", discusses six other women named Rachel who were Jewish victims of Palestinian terrorism in the Arab-Israeli conflict. Their deaths, he wrote, received little if any coverage outside Israel.<ref name="forgotten-rachels">{{cite news |title=The Forgotten Rachels |last=Gross |first=Tom |authorlink=Tom Gross |date=October 22, 2005 |url=http://www.spectator.co.uk:80/article.php?table=%A7ion=&issue=2005-10-22&id=6796 |work=The Spectator |accessdate=September 8, 2012}}{{dead link|date=August 2020|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}} [http://www.tomgrossmedia.com/TheForgottenRachels.html Alt URL]</ref> Gross went on to argue that "partly because of the efforts of Corrie's fellow activists in the ISM, the Israeli army was unable to stop the flow of weapons through the tunnels.... Those weapons were later used to kill Israeli children ... in southern Israel". The article prompted a ''[[National Review]]'' editorial arguing "Corrie's death was unfortunate, but more unfortunate is a Western media and cultural establishment that lionizes 'martyrs' for illiberal causes while ignoring the victims those causes create."<ref>{{cite news |title=The Week |work=National Review |date=May 23, 2005 |page=10}}<!-- nationalreview.com does not search that far back, and archive.org's archives of nationalreview.com for May 23, 2005, and days following, do not include articles titled "The Week" or seemingly any mention of Rachel Corrie. --></ref> Explaining the Israeli court's ruling, judge Oded Gershon said Corrie's death was "the result of an accident she brought upon herself." Corrie was in a closed military area, with entry forbidden to civilians. The area was the site of daily gunfire by snipers, missile fire and [[IEDs|IED]] explosions. The United States government had issued a travel warning against American citizens visiting the Gaza Strip. "She did not distance herself from the area, as any thinking person would have done," the judge ruled.<ref>{{cite news |last=Friedman |first=Matti |date=August 28, 2012 |title=Court dismisses damages claim in Rachel Corrie case |url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/rachel-corries-death-ruled-accidental-by-haifa-high-court/ |work=The Times of Israel |accessdate=July 10, 2014}}</ref>

===Role of the International Solidarity Movement===
George Rishmawi, director of the [[Palestinian Center for Rapprochement between Peoples]], told the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' that the ISM's main purpose is to "increase international awareness of Palestinian suffering through the involvement of foreign activists". He stated: "When Palestinians get shot by Israeli soldiers, no one is interested anymore ... [b]ut if some of these foreign volunteers get shot or even killed, then the international media will sit up and take notice."<ref>{{cite news |last1=Kalman |first1=Matthew |last2=Castle |first2=Teresa |date=July 14, 2004 |title=S.F.

==Subsequent events==
===Lawsuits===
====In the United States====
Corrie's family and several Palestinians filed a federal lawsuit against [[Caterpillar Inc.]] in the [[United States District Court for the Western District of Washington]] alleging liability for Corrie's death. The suit alleged Caterpillar supplied the bulldozers to the Israelis despite having notice they would be used to further "a policy plaintiffs contend violates international law". The case was dismissed by a Federal judge in November 2005 for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, citing, among other things, the [[political question]] doctrine. The judge found, alternatively, that the plaintiffs' claims failed on the merits.<ref>Corrie v. Caterpillar, Inc., 403 F.Supp.2d 1019 (W.D.Wash. 2005)</ref>

The Corrie family appealed to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]]. In September 2007 the Ninth Circuit affirmed the dismissal on the [[political question]] grounds and thus did not rule on the merits of the suit. The Court found that as the bulldozers were paid for by the U.S. Government as part of its aid to Israel, the Judicial Branch could not rule on the merits of the case without ruling on whether or not the government's financing of such bulldozers was appropriate and that this was a matter not entrusted to the Judicial Branch.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/ca9/newopinions.nsf/6DFD4322CA06B5FA88257359005660A6/$file/0536210.pdf?openelement |title=Text of opinion by United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit |accessdate=2007-11-17 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071117111442/http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/ca9/newopinions.nsf/6DFD4322CA06B5FA88257359005660A6/%24file/0536210.pdf?openelement |archivedate=November 17, 2007 |df=mdy }}.

====In Israel====
In 2010, Corrie's parents, represented by Attorney Hussein Abu Hussein, filed a lawsuit against the Israel Defense Forces and the [[Ministry of Defense (Israel)|Israeli Defense Ministry]] in the [[Haifa]] District Court, seeking US$324,000 in compensation.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3860805,00.html |title=Trial begins over death of US activist in Gaza |work=Ynetnews |accessdate=August 31, 2012}}</ref> The case began in Haifa on March 10, 2010.<ref>{{cite news |last=McCarthy |first=Rory |date=February 23, 2010 |title=Rachel Corrie's family bring civil suit over human shield's death in Gaza |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/feb/23/corrie-death-law-case |work=The Guardian |accessdate=July 6, 2014}}</ref> Judge Oded Gershon presided over the case. On October 21, 2010, the bulldozer driver who had run over Corrie testified for four hours, and was cross-examined by the Corries' attorney. At the request of state prosecutors, who argued that his life could be imperiled if he was publicly identified, the driver was hidden behind a screen and visible to only the judge and attorneys. A request by the Corrie family that they also be allowed to see the driver was turned down by the judge. The driver was identified only by his initials, "YB", and a gag order was imposed on identifying details, although it was disclosed in court that he was a 38-year old Russian immigrant who had arrived in Israel at age 23, and was working for a food processing company at the time. The driver denied having seen her before hitting her.<ref>{{cite news |last=Sherwood |first=Harriet |date=October 21, 2010 |title=Rachel Corrie case: Israeli soldier in bulldozer 'did not see her' |work=The Guardian |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/oct/21/rachel-corrie-israeli-bulldozer-driver-court |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171009194753/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/oct/21/rachel-corrie-israeli-bulldozer-driver-court |archivedate=October 9, 2017 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Sanders |first=Edmund |date=October 21, 2010 |title=Bulldozer driver testifies in Israeli trial over Rachel Corrie's death |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2010/oct/21/world/la-fg-israel-corrie-20101022 |work=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=July 6, 2014}}</ref> In addition, four experts, including an expert on the behalf of the Corrie family testified during the trial, and concluded that the bulldozer driver could not see Corrie.<ref>{{cite news |last=Ben Gedalyahu |first=Tzvi |date=August 28, 2012 |title=Court Finds Corrie at Fault for Her Death, Exonerates IDF |url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/159367 |work=[[Arutz Sheva]] |accessdate=September 9, 2012}}</ref> Four ISM witnesses testified during the case.

The court ruled against Corrie's family on August 28, 2012.

Furthermore, Gershon pointed to three different entry bans, and also pointed out that the [[Philadelphi route]] was effectively a war zone and was formally declared a closed military zone when Corrie died. Gershon also noted that the United States had issued an Israel travel advisory warning to avoid Gaza and the West Bank. In addition, Gershon said that the ISM "abuses the human rights discourse to blur its actions which are de facto violence" and specialized in disrupting IDF activity, which "included an army of activists serving as 'human shields' for terrorists wanted by Israeli security forces, financial and logistical aid to Palestinians including terrorists and their families, and disruption of the sealing of suicide bombers' houses".<ref name="court reject ynet">{{cite news |last=Raved |first=Ahiya |date=August 28, 2012 |title=Court rejects Corrie family civil suit |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4273862,00.html |agency=Reuters |work=Ynetnews |accessdate=August 28, 2012}}</ref> The Corrie family lawyer, Hussein Abu Hussein, said they were "now studying our options", in regards to a possible appeal.<ref>{{cite web |last=Musleh |first=Maath |date=August 29, 2012 |title=On the receiving end of Israeli 'impunity' |url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2012/08/2012829112558460810.html |work=Al Jazeera |accessdate=July 6, 2014}}</ref>

While rejecting the Corrie family's claims to damages, the judge also waived the Corrie family's court costs.

Haifa District Court spokeswoman Nitzan Eyal said that her family could appeal the ruling. The amount sought was a symbolic US$1 and legal costs. Her mother reacted to the verdict in saying: "I am hurt. We are, of course, deeply saddened and deeply troubled by what we heard today from Judge Oded Gershon." Corrie's sister, Sarah Corrie Simpson, stated that she believed "without a doubt" that the driver had seen her as he approached, and stated that she hoped he would one day "have the courage" to tell the truth. The right wing political party [[Yisrael Beitenu]] issued a statement that called the verdict "vindication after vilification".<ref name="verd">{{cite news |date=August 28, 2012 |title=Israel rules activist's death 'an accident' |url=http://www.aljazeera.com/video/middleeast/2012/08/201282862745947503.html |work=Al Jazeera |accessdate=July 6, 2014}}</ref>

Former [[United Nations Special Rapporteur|UN Special Rapporteur]] on the occupied Palestinian Territories [[Richard Falk]] said of the verdict that it was "a sad outcome, above all for the Corrie family that had initiated the case back in 2005, but also for the rule of law and the hope that an Israeli court would place limits on the violence of the state, particularly in relation to innocents and unarmed civilians in an occupied territory".<ref name="unfalk">{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=42780&Cr=Israel&Cr1=Palestin |title=UN human rights expert speaks out on Israeli ruling on Rachel Corrie verdict |publisher=The United Nations |date=August 30, 2012 |accessdate=September 1, 2012}}</ref> Former U.S. President [[Jimmy Carter]] of the [[Carter Center]] said that the "court's decision confirms a climate of impunity, which facilitates Israeli human rights violations against Palestinian civilians in the Occupied Territory".<ref>{{cite news |title=Jimmy Carter calls Rachel Corrie case ruling 'unacceptable' |work=The Jewish Journal of Greater Los Angeles |date=August 30, 2012 |url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:AWNB:LEWB&rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&rft_dat=1410347E2CA7F220&svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&req_dat=0D663DC0A81A15EA|accessdate=September 1, 2012}}</ref>

===Documentaries===
In 2003, British Channel 4 and ''[[The Observer]]'' reporter [[Sandra Jordan]] and producer Rodrigo Vasquez made a documentary that was aired June 2003 on [[Channel 4]] titled ''The Killing Zone'', about ongoing violence in the Gaza Strip. Jordan said: "There has been a lot of interest in Britain and around the world about what happened to Rachel, I find it highly disappointing that no serious American investigative journalist has taken Rachel's story seriously or questioned or challenged the Israeli Army version of events."<ref>{{cite web |last=Woodward |first=Heather |date=September 27, 2003 |title=Film on Rachel Corrie in the works |url=http://www.evergreen.edu/news/archive/2003/10/corrie |work=[[The Olympian]] |publisher=The Evergreen State College |accessdate=May 12, 2012}}</ref>

{{Main|MV Rachel Corrie}}

On March 30, 2010, an 1800-tonne vessel was bought at auction in [[Dundalk]], Ireland, for €70,000 by the [[Free Gaza Movement]]. It was outfitted for use in a voyage to Gaza, named in honour of Rachel Corrie and launched May 12, 2010. It sailed to join a flotilla intended to break the [[blockade of the Gaza Strip]]. The [[Gaza flotilla raid|flotilla was intercepted]]; however, the MV ''Rachel Corrie'' had not reached the other ships and continued towards Gaza by itself. Israeli navy officers addressed the ship as "Linda"—the vessel's name before it was renamed for Rachel Corrie.<ref name="AP Defiant">{{cite news|last=Laub |first=Karin |agency=Associated Press |title=Israel remains defiant, seizes Gaza-bound aid ship |date=June 5, 2010 |url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5gXp6fvvgQLELYgmlMBK-EaQ8A1WQD9G59PL00 |accessdate=June 5, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100608092132/https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5gXp6fvvgQLELYgmlMBK-EaQ8A1WQD9G59PL00 |archivedate=June 8, 2010 }}</ref> The ship was intercepted by the Israeli navy on Saturday, June 5, 2010, 23 miles off the coast, and diverted to the port of [[Ashdod]].
