The '''University of Reading ''' is a [[public university]] in [[Reading, Berkshire]], England. It was founded in 1892 as '''University College, Reading''', a [[University of Oxford]] extension college.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/0/university-of-reading-guide/|title=University of Reading guide}}</ref> The institution received the power to grant its own degrees in 1926 by [[royal charter]] from King [[George V]] and was the only university to receive such a charter between the two [[world war]]s. The university is usually categorised as a [[red brick university]], reflecting its original foundation in the 19th century.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.reading.ac.uk/15/about/about-facts.aspx|title=Facts and figures|website=University of Reading|access-date=23 September 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150925130238/http://www.reading.ac.uk/15/about/about-facts.aspx|archive-date=25 September 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Reading has four major campuses. In the United Kingdom, the campuses on [[London Road Campus|London Road]] and [[Whiteknights Park|Whiteknights]] are based in the town of Reading itself, and [[Greenlands]] is based on the banks of the [[River Thames]], Buckinghamshire. It also has a campus in [[Iskandar Puteri]], Malaysia. The university has been arranged into 16 academic schools since 2016. The annual income of the institution for 2016–17 was £275.3&nbsp;million of which £35.4&nbsp;million was from research grants and contracts, with an expenditure of £297.5&nbsp;million.<ref name="University of Reading Financial Statement 16/17" />

===University College===
The university owes its first origins to the Schools of Art and Science established in Reading in 1860 and 1870. In 1892 the ''College at Reading'' was founded as an extension college by [[Christ Church, Oxford|Christ Church]], a college of the [[University of Oxford]]. The first President was the geographer [[Sir Halford John Mackinder]], and the college's first home was the old [[Hospitium of St John the Baptist|hospitium building]] behind [[Reading Town Hall]]. The Schools of Art and Science were transferred to the new college by Reading Town Council in the same year.<ref name=uorhist>{{cite web |url=http://www.reading.ac.uk/about/about-history.asp |title=The University's History |publisher=University of Reading |access-date=30 April 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302203516/http://www.reading.ac.uk/about/about-history.aspx |archive-date=2 March 2012 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=tui86>{{cite web |url=http://www.reading.ac.uk/internal/staffportal/news/articles/spsn-357935.aspx |title=The University of Reading is 85 years old |publisher=University of Reading |date=16 March 2011 |access-date=21 March 2011 |archive-date=25 November 2011 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111125180507/http://www.reading.ac.uk/internal/staffportal/news/articles/spsn-357935.aspx}}</ref><ref name=odonbwc>{{cite web | url = http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/32402 | title = Childs, William Macbride (1869–1939), educationist | work = Oxford Dictionary of National Biography | publisher = Oxford University Press | first = T.A.B. | last = Corley | access-date =8 February 2010}}</ref><ref name=aqhosp>{{cite web |url=https://www.readingabbeyquarter.org.uk/hospitium |title=Hospitium |work=readingabbeyquarter.org.uk |publisher=Reading Borough Council |access-date=6 February 2020 |archive-date=6 February 2020 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200206130450/https://www.readingabbeyquarter.org.uk/hospitium}}</ref>

The new college received its first treasury grant in 1901. Three years later it was given a site, now the university's [[London Road Campus]], by the Palmer family of [[Huntley & Palmers]] fame. The same family supported the opening of [[Wantage Hall]] in 1908 and of the Research Institute in Dairying in 1912.<ref name=uorhist/>

===University status===
The college first applied for a [[Royal Charter]] in 1920 but was unsuccessful at that time. However a second petition, in 1925, was successful, and the charter was officially granted on 17 March 1926. With the charter, the college became the University of Reading, the only new university to be created in the United Kingdom between the two world wars.<ref name=uorhist/> It was added to the [[Combined English Universities (UK Parliament constituency)|Combined English Universities]] constituency in 1928 in time for the 1929 general election.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

In 1947 the university purchased [[Whiteknights Park]], which was to become its principal campus. In 1984 the University started a merger with Bulmershe College of Higher Education, which was completed in 1989.<ref name=uorhist/><ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.reading.ac.uk/about/about-architecture.asp|title = Campus Architecture|access-date =24 July 2007|publisher = University of Reading}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si1989/Uksi_19890408_en_1.htm |title=Statutory Instrument 1989 no. 408 |publisher=Opsi.gov.uk |access-date=28 May 2010}}</ref>

===2006–present===
In October 2006, the Senior Management Board proposed<ref>[http://www.extra.rdg.ac.uk/news/details.asp?ID=712 Official statement about the Physics Department on the University website] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120525121403/http://www.extra.rdg.ac.uk/news/details.asp?ID=712 |date=25 May 2012 }}</ref> the closure of its Physics Department to future undergraduate application. This was ascribed to financial reasons and lack of alternative ideas and caused considerable controversy, not least a debate in [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.martinsalter.com/diary.asp?storyID=235&storyType=parliament |title=Information page of Labour MP for Reading West, Martin Salter |access-date=6 October 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080621111619/http://www.martinsalter.com/diary.asp?storyID=235&storyType=parliament |archive-date=21 June 2008 }}</ref> over the closure which prompted heated discussion of higher education issues in general.<ref>[http://www.extra.rdg.ac.uk/news/details.asp?ID=719 Official Statement about University Senate vote from University website] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120525121403/http://www.extra.rdg.ac.uk/news/details.asp?ID=719 |date=25 May 2012 }}</ref> On 10 October the Senate voted to close the Department of Physics, a move confirmed by the council on 20 November.<ref name=bbc>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/6159106.stm |title=article concerning the confirmed closure of the Physics department |publisher=BBC News |date=21 November 2006 |access-date=28 May 2010}}</ref> Other departments closed in recent years include Music, Sociology, Geology, and Mechanical Engineering. The university council decided in March 2009 to close the School of Health and Social Care, a school whose courses have consistently been oversubscribed.<ref name=the1>Melanie Newman, [http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=26&storycode=405430&c=1 "Institutions draw up plans for closures and job losses"], ''Times Higher Education'', 19 February 2009</ref><ref name=the2>Melanie Newman, [http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=26&storycode=405929&c=1 "Alarm grows as jobs to go at four more institutions"], ''Times Higher Education'', 26 March 2009</ref>

In January 2008, the university announced its merger with the [[Henley Management College]] to create the university's new ''Henley Business School'', bringing together Henley College's expertise in MBAs with the University's existing Business School and [[ICMA Centre]]. The merger took formal effect on 1 August 2008, with the new business school split across the university's existing Whiteknights Campus and its new Greenlands Campus that formerly housed Henley Management College.<ref name=henmerge>{{cite web | url = http://www.reading.ac.uk/about/newsandevents/releases/PR11148.asp | title = World-class business school to be created as University of Reading merges with Henley Management College | publisher = University of Reading | date = 9 January 2008}}</ref><ref name=uofbrs8>{{cite news | title = Briefing News Update – Henley Business School | date = Summer 2008 | publisher = University of Reading}}</ref>

A restructuring of the university was announced in September 2009, which would bring together all the academic schools into three faculties, these being the Faculty of Science, the Faculty of Humanities, Arts and Social sciences, and Henley Business School. The move was predicted to result in the loss of some jobs, especially in the film, theatre and television department, which has since moved into a brand new [[GBP|£]]11.5&nbsp;million building on Whiteknights Campus.<ref>{{cite news | first = Hannah | last = Fearn | url = http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=26&storycode=408112&c=2 | title = Reading plans restructuring | publisher = Times Higher Education | date = 11 September 2009}}</ref>

In late 2009 it was announced that the London Road Campus was to undergo a [[GBP|£]]30&nbsp;million renovation, preparatory to becoming the new home of the university's Institute of Education. The Institute moved to its new home in January 2012.<ref name="reading.ac.uk">{{cite web|title=Welcome to your new home – Institute of Education|url=https://www.reading.ac.uk/internal/staffportal/news/articles/spsn-432335.aspx|website=The University of Reading|access-date=16 June 2017|language=en-gb|date=10 February 2012}}</ref> The refurbishment was partially funded by the sale of the adjoining site of [[Mansfield Hall]], a former hall of residence, for demolition and replacement by private sector student accommodation.<ref name=ua30mr>{{cite web | url = http://www.reading.ac.uk/about/newsandevents/releases/PR258812.aspx | archive-url = https://archive.is/20121223123909/http://www.reading.ac.uk/about/newsandevents/releases/PR258812.aspx | url-status = dead | archive-date = 23 December 2012 | title = University announces £30&nbsp;million development of historic London Road campus | publisher = University of Reading | date = 10 December 2009 | access-date = 21 March 2011 }}</ref>

In 2016 a move to reorganise the structure of Reading University provoked student protests.<ref name="Hyde">{{Cite web|url=http://www.getreading.co.uk/news/reading-berkshire-news/university-reading-student-slams-multi-10974928 |title=Cost-cutting review slammed by University of Reading student |last=Hyde |first=Nathan |website=getreading |access-date=13 March 2016 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160310184906/http://www.getreading.co.uk/news/reading-berkshire-news/university-reading-student-slams-multi-10974928 |archive-date=10 March 2016 }}</ref> On 21 March 2016, staff announced a vote of no confidence in the Vice Chancellor [[David Bell (university administrator)|Sir David Bell]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.getreading.co.uk/news/reading-berkshire-news/university-reading-vice-chancellor-faces-11070986|title=University of Reading vice chancellor faces vote of no confidence|last=Hyde|first=Nathan|website=getreading|access-date=29 March 2016}}</ref> 88% of those who voted backed the no confidence motion.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-berkshire-36045536|title='No confidence' in University of Reading vice-chancellor|website=bbc|access-date=3 May 2016}}</ref>

In 2019 ''[[The Guardian]]'' reported that the university was in "a financial and governance crisis" after recently reporting itself to regulators over a £121&nbsp;million loan. The university is sole trustee of the charitable [[National Institute for Research in Dairying]] trust, and after selling trust land had then borrowed the £121&nbsp;million proceeds from the trust, despite the potential conflict of interest in the decision making. Including this loan, the university has debts of £300&nbsp;million, as well as having an operating deficit of over £40&nbsp;million for the past two years.<ref name=guardian-20190209>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/feb/09/reading-university-in-crisis-amid-questions-over-121m-land-sales |title=Reading University in crisis amid questions over £121m land sales |author=Andrew McGettigan, Richard Adams |newspaper=The Guardian |date=9 February 2019 |access-date=9 February 2019}}</ref><ref name=readingchronicle-20190209>{{cite news |url=https://www.readingchronicle.co.uk/news/17420953.university-of-reading-expected-to-cut-jobs-due-to-challenging-financial-times/ |title=University of Reading expected to cut jobs due to challenging financial times |last=Adams |first=Luke |website=Reading Chronicle |date=9 February 2019 |access-date=9 February 2019}}</ref>

The university maintains over {{convert|1.6|km2|acre|0}} of grounds, in four distinct campuses:

===Whiteknights===
[[Whiteknights Park|Whiteknights Campus]], at {{convert|1.3|km2|acre|0}},<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.reading.ac.uk/about/about-campusstudents.asp|title = Campus life for students |access-date=17 November 2010 | publisher = University of Reading }}</ref> is the largest and includes Whiteknights Lake, conservation meadows and woodlands as well as most of the university's departments. The campus takes its name from the nickname of the 13th century [[knight]] John De Erleigh IV or the 'White Knight', and was landscaped in the 18th century by the [[John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough|Marquis of Blandford]]. The main university library, in the middle of the campus, holds nearly a million books and subscribes to around 4,000 periodicals. The Whiteknights campus was voted one of the best green spaces in the United Kingdom for the seventh year running in the 2017 [[Green Flag Award|Green Flag People's Choice awards]].<ref>{{cite web|title=University of Reading|url=https://www.reading.ac.uk/news-and-events/releases/PR733305.aspx|website=University of Reading|access-date=14 December 2017|language=en-uk}}</ref>

===London Road===
The smaller [[London Road Campus]] is the original university site and is closer to the town centre of Reading, sited across from the [[Royal Berkshire Hospital]]. The London Road site is home to The Institute of Education – a major provider of teacher training in the UK.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Smithers|first1=Alan|last2=Bungey|first2=Mandy-D|title=The Good Teacher Training Guide 2017|url=https://www.buckingham.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/GTTG17fin.pdf|website=University of Buckingham|publisher=Centre for Education and Employment Research|access-date=16 June 2017}}</ref> The Institute moved to its new home in January 2012 after the campus was refurbished at a cost of £30&nbsp;million.<ref name="reading.ac.uk"/> The London Road site also plays host to the University graduation ceremonies twice a year, in the Great Hall.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.reading.ac.uk/education/about/ioe-about.aspx|title=University of Reading|website=University of Reading}}</ref>

===Greenlands===
The [[Greenlands|Greenlands Campus]], on the banks of the [[River Thames]] in Buckinghamshire. Once the home of [[William Henry Smith (1825–1891)|William Henry Smith]], son of the founder of [[WH Smith]], and latterly the site of the [[Henley Management College]], this campus became part of the university on 1 August 2008, with the merger of that college with the university's Business School to form the ''Henley Business School''. The school's [[Master of Business Administration|MBA]] and corporate learning offerings will be based at Greenlands, with undergraduate and other postgraduate courses being based at Whiteknights.<ref name=uofbrs8/>

===Malaysia===
An Asian campus at [[Iskandar Malaysia|Iskandar]], [[Malaysia]] was formally opened in February 2016.<ref>{{cite news | title = University of Reading's £25m Malaysia campus officially opens | publisher = [[BBC News Online]] | date = 25 February 2016 | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-berkshire-35658862 | access-date = 2 March 2016}}</ref>  It offers a range of professional programmes at foundation, undergraduate and postgraduate levels including the [[Henley Business School]] [[Master of Business Administration|MBA]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.reading.edu.my/about-us | title = The University of Reading Malaysia – about us | website = The University of Reading Malaysia | access-date = 2 March 2016 }}</ref>  First announced in October 2012, it is the university's first overseas campus. The project was overseen by [[Tony Downes]].<ref>{{cite news|title=University of Reading Malaysia appoints Provost|url=http://www.reading.ac.uk/news-and-events/releases/PR470691.aspx|publisher=reading.ac.uk|date=23 October 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=University of Reading Malaysia|url=http://www.reading.ac.uk/malaysia/about/uorm-about.aspx|publisher=reading.ac.uk}}</ref>  Professor Wing Lam took over as Provost in May 2018 after the retirement of Tony Downes<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archive.reading.ac.uk/staff-news/spsn-759177.html|title=Tony Downes to retire; Wing Lam appointed new UoRM Provost|website=archive.reading.ac.uk|access-date=2019-11-26}}</ref> and led a successful exercise to restructure and refocus the campus in core professional disciplines that were aligned with the region's need for talent.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.reading.ac.uk/internal/staffportal/news/articles/spsn-797987.aspx|title=Changes at University of Reading Malaysia}}</ref>

===Other sites===
The former [[Bulmershe Court|Bulmershe Court Campus]] in [[Woodley, Berkshire|Woodley]] was the site of the former Bulmershe Teaching College, which merged with The University of Reading in 1989. The campus was sold in January 2014 as the University decided to concentrate its activity on its three other campuses. It had previously moved all teaching and research at Bulmershe either to Whiteknights or to London Road, and closed the student accommodation.

The university also owns {{convert|8.5|km2|acre|0}} of farmland in the nearby villages of [[Arborfield]], [[Sonning]] and [[Shinfield]]. These support a mixed farming system including dairy cows, ewes and beef animals, and host research centres of which the flagship is the Centre for Dairy Research.

As part of the proposed Whiteknights Development Plan in Autumn 2007, the University proposed spending up to £250&nbsp;million on its estates over 30 years, principally to focus academic activities onto the Whiteknights site.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.reading.ac.uk/whiteknights/consultation.pdf|format=PDF|title=Whiteknights development plan|publisher=University of Reading|access-date=9 March 2008}}</ref> The University also announced its intention to site some functions on the London Road site, and proposed a complete withdrawal from Bulmershe Court by 2012, which was accomplished.

===Museums, libraries and botanical gardens===
[[File:Reading University Main Library on Whiteknights Campus.JPG|thumb|right|The University Library on the Whiteknights Campus]]
Reading University maintains four museums, the main campus library, a range of inter-departmental libraries, and a [[botanical garden]]. The largest and best known of these museums is the [[Museum of English Rural Life]], which has recently relocated from a location on Whiteknights Campus to a site nearer the town centre next to the London Road Campus. The [[Ure Museum of Greek Archaeology]], the [[Cole Museum of Zoology]], the [[University of Reading Herbarium]] and the [[Harris Garden]] are all on the Whiteknights Campus.

The University Library at Whiteknights makes available over 1&nbsp;million physical resources, as well as a range of electronic online resources, from 14,000 square metres of space across seven floors. The secondary site library at the University's Bulmershe Campus closed in 2011 and its operative collections were transferred. There is also a library in the University's Meteorology department.

The library is currently undergoing a £40&nbsp;million refurbishment project<ref>{{cite web|title=University of Reading|url=https://www.reading.ac.uk/library/about-us/lib-news-refurbishment.aspx|website=University of Reading|access-date=14 December 2017|language=en-uk}}</ref> which started in 2016 and is anticipated to be completed by late 2019. The redevelopment will improve the energy efficiency of the building with the installation of new windows, cladding and roofing. New lifts, additional study seating capacity, a larger Library cafe with an outside seating area, more toilets (including disabled and gender-neutral provision) and card-access security barriers are also part of the refurbishment programme.

===Governing bodies and roles===
The university is nominally led by a [[Chancellor (education)|Chancellor]], who is the titular head of the university and is normally a well-known public figure. The day-to-day chief executive role is the responsibility of the [[Vice-Chancellor]], a full-time academic post. The senior management board of the university is headed by the Vice-Chancellor, assisted by a Deputy-Vice-Chancellor, three Pro-Vice-Chancellors, four Deans and five Heads of Directorate. It is responsible for the day-to-day management of the University and meets fortnightly throughout most of the year.<ref name=govn>{{cite web | url = http://www.reading.ac.uk/about/about-governance.asp | title = Governance of the University of Reading | publisher = University of Reading | access-date =24 July 2007}}</ref>

The senior management board reports to the university's Senate, the main academic administrative body. The senate has around 100 members and meets at least four times a year and advises on areas such as student entry, assessment and awards. Membership includes Deans, Heads and elected representatives of Schools, as well as professional staff and students. The Senate in turn reports to the council, which is the supreme governing body of the university, setting strategic direction, ensuring compliance with statutory requirements and approving constitutional changes. The Council meets four times a year and comprises a broad representation of lay members drawn from commercial, community and professional organisations.<ref name=govn/>

On 24 March 2016, it was announced that [[Baron Waldegrave of North Hill|William Waldegrave]] was to be the new Chancellor of Reading University.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-berkshire-35890720 "Lord Waldegrave named as Reading University chancellor"], ''BBC News'', 24 March 2016</ref> Lord Waldegrave is the fourth Conservative politician to be appointed Chancellor of the University, following [[Austen Chamberlain]], [[Samuel Hoare, 1st Viscount Templewood|Sir Samuel Hoare]] and [[Peter Carington, 6th Baron Carrington|Lord Carrington]]. Waldegrave's predecessor, [[John Madejski|Sir John Madejski]] is also a supporter of, and contributor to, the Conservative Party.{{citation needed|date=June 2020}}

==Student life==

===Students’ Union===
[https://www.rusu.co.uk Reading University Students' Union (RUSU)] is the affiliated student organisation which represents the students' interests. The university also has a number of [[Junior Common Room]]s that are linked to the Students' Union. The Students' Union has been the launchpad for many successful careers including [[Penny Mordaunt]] (MP for Portsmouth North), who was the 1994–5 President of the Students' Union.

[[Student unionism in the United Kingdom|The Students' Union]] runs the student radio station [https://www.junction11radio.co.uk Junction11 Radio]. It broadcasts locally from the Whiteknights campus in university retail outlets and over an internet [[live stream]] on a full-time basis. The station was formed in 1997 and started broadcasting in 2001 on 1287AM and transferred to solely online in 2007. It also publishes the [[Spark (University of Reading Newspaper)|Spark]], a newspaper aimed at the student population of the University, which is published fortnightly during term-time only and award-winning student television station RU:ON.

The union provides a free advice service to students, and facilitates over 160 different activities for students to get involved in.<ref>https://www.rusu.co.uk/student-activities/societies/</ref> The Students' Union building on Whiteknights Campus contains a 2500 capacity venue called 3sixty (recently renovated in 2018), with seven bars, and a number of retail outlets. The retail outlets include an Asian supermarket, a Starbucks and a hairdressers.

===Halls and accommodation===

[[File:SNV33481.JPG|thumbnail|[[St Patrick's Hall]], Pearson Court ]]
Student accommodation is provided in a number of [[hall of residence|halls of residence]] offering a mix of partially catered (19 meals per week) and self-catering accommodation, along with other self-catering accommodation. Following a major review the University is now proceeding with the integrated Halls and Catering Strategy, that will see several halls replaced as well as new ones created with social, catering & welfare facilities provided in hub areas.<ref name="Halls Redevelopment Information">{{cite web | url = http://www.rdg.ac.uk/about/about-localHallsRDPapp.asp| title = Halls Redevelopment Information | publisher = University of Reading | page = 1 | access-date =21 February 2009}}</ref> Most of the halls of residence lie close to the northern campus periphery and in residential areas close by.

Wantage Hall is thought to be the oldest purpose-built hall in England<ref>[[Aberdare Hall]] in Cardiff (formerly University College of South Wales and Monmouthshire, now Cardiff University) would appear to predate it.</ref> outside of 'Oxbridge' and is built in the style of an 'Oxbridge' college.

St. Andrews Hall closed in 2001 and is now the home of the [[Museum of English Rural Life]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.reading.ac.uk/merl/online_exhibitions/history/index.php | title = The History of St. Andrew's Hall | publisher = The Museum of English Rural Life | work = Online Exhibitions | access-date =11 January 2011}}</ref>

St. George's Hall and the Reading Student Village (renamed Benyon) are leased back to the University from [[University Partnership Programme (UPP)|UPP]]. The cost of leasing back the Student Village to the University, according to the University accounts, was £1.3&nbsp;million in 2002–03 and £1.5&nbsp;million for 2003–04.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

In 2011 the management of the mature and international halls, Hillside and Martindale, was taken over by the "Estates management team", as was Bulmershe Hall in 2012, the sale of which was finalised in 2014.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.reading.ac.uk/internal/staffportal/news/articles/spsn-559306.aspx |title=University finalises sale of Bulmershe campus |publisher=University of Reading |date=21 January 2014 |access-date=26 October 2015}}</ref> In the same year the new Kendrick Halls were opened on the ground of halls which had not been in use for many years. These are not managed by the university.

[[File:Reading Enterprise Hub.jpg|thumb|right|The former Reading Enterprise Hub on Whiteknights Campus]]

===Reading Enterprise Hub===
Reading Enterprise Hub is a [[business incubator]] opened in 2003. The hub was jointly sponsored by the university and [[South East England Development Agency|SEEDA]], and sought to attract startup high tech companies, particularly those with interests in [[environmental technology]], information technology, [[life sciences]], and [[materials science]].<ref name=uorreh>{{cite web | url = http://www.reading.ac.uk/businessdevelopment/property/hub.htm | title = Reading Enterprise Hub | publisher = University of Reading | access-date =7 April 2010 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060925123906/http://www.reading.ac.uk/businessdevelopment/property/hub.htm | archive-date = 25 September 2006}}</ref>

The hub was originally situated in World War II-era temporary office buildings on the university's Whiteknights campus. During the summer of 2008, the hub was demolished, along with the neighbouring former agriculture buildings, and the remaining tenants relocated to a building on the London Road campus. As of April 2010, a new Reading Enterprise Centre is being constructed on the hub's original site.<ref name=uorec>{{cite web | title = Facilities for Business at the University of Reading | url = http://www.reading.ac.uk/nmsruntime/saveasdialog.aspx?lID=42431&sID=104339 | publisher = University of Reading | access-date =7 April 2010}}</ref>
