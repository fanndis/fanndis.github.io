'''Inheritance''' is the practice of passing on [[private property]], [[Title (property)|titles]], [[debt]]s, [[rights]], and [[Law of obligations|obligations]] upon the [[death]] of an [[individual]]. The rules of inheritance differ among societies and have changed over time.

==Terminology==
In law, an ''heir'' is a person who is entitled to receive a share of the [[decedent|deceased]]'s (the person who died) property, subject to the rules of inheritance in the [[jurisdiction]] of which the deceased was a citizen or where the deceased (decedent) died or owned property at the time of death.

The inheritance may be either under the terms of a [[will (law)|will]] or by [[intestate]] laws if the deceased had no will.  However, the will must comply with the laws of the jurisdiction at the time it was created or it will be declared invalid (for example, some states do not recognise [[holographic will]]s as valid, or only in specific circumstances) and the intestate laws then apply.

A person does not become an heir before the death of the deceased, since the exact identity of the persons entitled to inherit is determined only then. Members of ruling noble or royal houses who are expected to become heirs are called [[Heir apparent|heirs apparent]] if first in line and incapable of being displaced from inheriting by another claim; otherwise, they are [[Heir presumptive|heirs presumptive]]. There is a further concept of joint inheritance, pending renunciation by all but one, which is called [[Co-parceners|coparceny]].

In modern law, the terms ''inheritance'' and ''heir'' refer exclusively to succession to property by descent from a deceased dying [[Intestacy|intestate]]. Takers in property succeeded to under a will are termed generally ''[[beneficiary|beneficiaries]],'' and specifically ''devises'' for [[real property]], ''sequesters'' for [[personal property]] (except money), or ''legatees'' for money.

Except in some jurisdictions where a person cannot be legally disinherited (such as the United States state of [[Louisiana]], which allows disinheritance only under specifically enumerated circumstances), a person who would be an heir under intestate laws may be disinherited completely under the terms of a will (an example is that of the will of comedian [[Jerry Lewis]]; his will specifically disinherited his six children by his first wife, and their descendants, leaving his entire estate to his second wife).

==History==
{{Details|Historical inheritance systems}}
Detailed [[Anthropology|anthropological]] and [[sociology|sociological]] studies have been made about customs of patrimonial inheritance, where only male children can inherit. Some cultures also employ [[matrilineal]] succession, where property can only pass along the female line, most commonly going to the sister's sons of the decedent; but also, in some societies, from the mother to her daughters. Some ancient societies and most modern states employ egalitarian inheritance, without discrimination based on gender and/or birth order.

==Religious laws about inheritance==
===Jewish laws===
The inheritance is patrimonial. The father —that is, the owner of the land— bequeaths only to his male descendants, so the Promised Land passes from one Jewish father to his sons.

If there were no living sons and no descendants of any previously living sons, daughters inherit. In {{bibleverse||Numbers|27:1-4|HE}}, the daughters of Zelophehad (Mahlah, Noa, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah) of the tribe of Manasseh come to Moses and ask for their father's inheritance, as they have no brothers. The order of inheritance is set out in {{bibleverse||Numbers|27:7-11|HE}}: a man's sons inherit first, daughters if no sons, brothers if he has no children, and so on.

Later, in {{bibleverse||Numbers|36|HE}}, some of the heads of the families of the tribe of Manasseh come to Moses and point out that, if a daughter inherits and then marries a man not from her paternal tribe, her land will pass from her birth-tribe's inheritance into her marriage-tribe's. So a further rule is laid down: if a daughter inherits land, she must marry someone within her father's tribe. (The daughters of Zelophehad marry the sons' of their father's brothers. There is no indication that this was not their choice.)

The tractate [[Baba Bathra]], written during late Antiquity in Babylon, deals extensively with issues of property ownership and inheritance according to Jewish Law. Other works of Rabbinical Law, such as the Hilkhot naḥalot: mi-sefer Mishneh Torah leha-Rambam,<ref name="chabad.org">{{cite web|url=http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1170531/jewish/Chapter-2.htm|title=Nachalot - Chapter 2|website=www.chabad.org|accessdate=28 September 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130609033429/http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1170531/jewish/Chapter-2.htm|archivedate=9 June 2013}}</ref> and the [[Sefer (Hebrew)|Sefer]] ha-yerushot: ʻim yeter ha-mikhtavim be-divre ha-halakhah be-ʻAravit uve-ʻIvrit uve-Aramit<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/seferhayerushot00mlgoog|title=Sefer ha-yerushot: ʻim yeter ha-mikhtavim be-divre ha-halakhah be-ʻAravit uve-ʻIvrit uve-Aramit|first=Joel Müller|last=Saʻadia ben Joseph |date=28 September 1897|publisher=Ernest Leroux|accessdate=28 September 2017|via=Internet Archive}}</ref> also deal with inheritance issues. The first, often abbreviated to [[Mishneh Torah]], was written by [[Maimonides]] and was very important in [[Jewish]] tradition.

All these sources agree that the firstborn son is entitled to a double portion of his father's estate: {{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|21:17|HE}}. This means that, for example, if a father left five sons, the firstborn receives a third of the estate and each of the other four receives a sixth. If he left nine sons, the firstborn receives a fifth and each of the other eight receive a tenth.<ref name="chabad.org" /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bjec.org/about/moot_court_sources.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-04-02 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304094445/http://www.bjec.org/about/moot_court_sources.pdf |archivedate=2016-03-04 }}</ref> If the eldest surviving son is not the firstborn son, he is not entitled to the double portion.

[[Philo of Alexandria]]<ref>Spec. Leg. 2.130</ref> and [[Josephus]]<ref>Ant. 4.249</ref> also comment on the [[Jewish]] laws of inheritance, praising them above other law codes of their time. They also agreed that the firstborn son must receive a double portion of his father's estate.

===Christian laws===
At first, Christianity did not have its own inheritance traditions distinct from Judaism. With the accession of [[Constantine the Great|Emperor Constantine]] in 306, Christians both began to distance themselves from Judaism and to have influence on the law and practices of secular institutions. From the beginning, this included inheritance. The Roman practice of [[Adoption in ancient Rome|adoption]] was a specific target, because it was perceived to be in conflict with the Judeo-Christian doctrine of [[primogeniture]]. As Stephanie Coontz documents in ''Marriage, a History'' (Penguin, 2006), not only succession but the whole constellation of rights and practices that included marriage, adoption, legitimacy, consanguinity, and inheritance changed in Western Europe from a Greco-Roman model to a Judeo-Christian pattern, based on Biblical and traditional Judeo-Christian principles. The transformation was essentially complete in the Middle Ages, although in English-speaking countries there was additional development under the influence of [[Henry VIII|Protestantism]]. Even when Europe became secularized and Christianity faded into the background, the legal foundation Christendom had laid remained. Only in the era of modern jurisprudence have there been significant changes.

===Islamic laws===
{{Main|Islamic inheritance jurisprudence}}
The [[Quran]] introduced a number of different rights and restrictions on matters of inheritance, including general improvements to the treatment of women and family life compared to the pre-Islamic societies that existed in the Arabian Peninsula at the time.<ref name="EI2">{{Cite encyclopedia |edition=second |publisher=Brill Academic Publishers |isbn=90-04-09419-9 |volume=7 |editor=C.E. Bosworth |display-editors=et al |title=Mīrāth |encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia of Islam |year=1993}}</ref> Furthermore, the Quran introduced additional heirs that were not entitled to inheritance in pre-Islamic times, mentioning nine relatives specifically of which six were female and three were male. However, the inheritance rights of women remained inferior to those of men because in Islam someone always has a responsibility of looking after a woman's expenses. According to the Quran, for example, a son is entitled to twice as much inheritance as a daughter.{{Quran-usc|4|11}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://corpus.quran.com/translation.jsp?chapter=4&verse=11|title=The Quranic Arabic Corpus - Translation|website=corpus.quran.com|accessdate=28 September 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170301132410/http://corpus.quran.com/translation.jsp?chapter=4&verse=11|archivedate=1 March 2017}}</ref> The Quran also presented efforts to fix the laws of inheritance, and thus forming a complete legal system. This development was in contrast to pre-Islamic societies where rules of inheritance varied considerably.<ref name="EI2" /> In addition to the above changes, the Quran imposed restrictions on [[testamentary]] powers of a [[Muslim]] in disposing his or her property. 
The Quran contains only three verses that give specific details of inheritance and shares, in addition to few other verses dealing with testamentary. {{Quran-usc|4|11,12,176}}<ref>[http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/004-qmt.php#002.11] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150501064500/http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/004-qmt.php |date=2015-05-01 }}</ref> But this information was used as a starting point by Muslim jurists who expounded the laws of inheritance even further using [[Hadith]], as well as methods of juristic reasoning like [[Qiyas]]. Nowadays, inheritance is considered an integral part of [[Sharia law]] and its application for Muslims is mandatory, though many peoples (see [[Historical inheritance systems]]), despite being Muslim, have other inheritance customs.

The distribution of the inherited wealth has varied greatly among different cultures and legal traditions.

In cases of unequal inheritance, the majority might receive little while only a small number inherit a larger amount.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} The amount of inheritance is often far less than the value of a business initially given to the son, especially when a son takes over a thriving multimillion-dollar business, yet the daughter is given the balance of the actual inheritance amounting to far less than the value of business that was initially given to the son. This is especially seen in old world cultures, but continues in many families to this day.<ref>Davies, James B. "The Relative Impact of Inheritance and Other Factors on Economic Inequality". The ''[[Quarterly Journal of Economics]]'', Vol. 97, No. 3, pp. 471</ref>

Arguments for eliminating forced heirship include the right to property and the merit of individual allocation of capital over government wealth confiscation and redistribution, but this does not resolve what some{{who|date=January 2018}} describe as the problem of unequal inheritance. In terms of inheritance inequality, some economists and sociologists focus on the inter generational transmission of income or wealth which is said to have a direct impact on one's mobility (or immobility) and class position in society. Nations differ on the political structure and policy options that govern the transfer of wealth.<ref>Angel, Jacqueline L. Inheritance in Contemporary America: The Social Dimensions of Giving across Generations. p. 35</ref>

According to the American federal government statistics compiled by Mark Zandi in 1985, the average US inheritance was $39,000. In subsequent years, the overall amount of total annual inheritance more than doubled, reaching nearly $200 billion. By 2050, there will be an estimated $25 trillion inheritance transmitted across generations.<ref name="Marable">Marable, Manning. "Letter From America: Inheritance, Wealth and Race."

Some researchers have attributed this rise to the [[baby boomer]] generation. Historically, the baby boomers were the largest influx of children conceived after WW2.

===Social stratification===
It has been argued that inheritance plays a significant effect on social stratification. Inheritance is an integral component of family, economic, and legal institutions, and a basic mechanism of [[class stratification]]. It also affects the [[distribution of wealth]] at the societal level.  The total cumulative effect of inheritance on stratification outcomes takes three forms, according to scholars who have examined the subject.

The first form of inheritance is the inheritance of [[cultural capital]] (i.e. linguistic styles, higher status social circles, and aesthetic preferences).<ref name="Edited by">(Edited By) Miller, Robert K., McNamee, Stephen J.  Inheritance and Wealth in America. p. 2</ref> The second form of inheritance is through familial interventions in the form of ''inter vivos'' transfers (i.e. gifts between the living), especially at crucial junctures in the life courses.  Examples include during a child's milestone stages, such as going to college, getting married, getting a job, and purchasing a home.<ref name="Edited by" /> The third form of inheritance is the transfers of bulk estates at the time of death of the testators, thus resulting in significant economic advantage accruing to children during their adult years.<ref>(Edited By) Miller, Robert K., McNamee, Stephen L.  Inheritance and Wealth in America. p. 4</ref> The origin of the stability of inequalities is material (personal possessions one is able to obtain) and is also cultural, rooted either in varying child-rearing practices that are geared to socialization according to social class and economic position.  Child-rearing practices among those who inherit wealth may center around favoring some groups at the expense of others at the bottom of the [[social hierarchy]].<ref>Clignet, Remi. Death, Deeds, and Descendants: Inheritance in Modern America. p. 3</ref>

===Sociological and economic effects of inheritance inequality===
It is further argued that the degree to which economic status and inheritance is transmitted across generations determines one's life chances in society. Although many have linked one's social origins and educational attainment to life chances and opportunities, education cannot serve as the most influential predictor of [[economic mobility]].  In fact, children of well-off parents generally receive better schooling and benefit from material, cultural, and genetic inheritances.<ref>Bowles, Samuel; Gintis, Herbert, "The Inheritance of Inequality." ''[[Journal of Economic Perspectives]]'' Vol. 16, No. 3, 2002, p. 4</ref> Likewise, schooling attainment is often persistent across generations and families with higher amounts of inheritance are able to acquire and transmit higher amounts of human capital.  Lower amounts of human capital and inheritance can perpetuate inequality in the housing market and higher education.  Research reveals that inheritance plays an important role in the accumulation of housing wealth.  Those who receive an inheritance are more likely to own a home than those who do not regardless of the size of the inheritance.<ref>Flippen, Chenoa A. "Racial and Ethnic Inequality in Homeownership and Housing Equity." The Sociological Quarterly, Volume 42, No. 2 p. 134</ref>

Often, racial or religious minorities and individuals from socially disadvantaged backgrounds receive less inheritance and wealth.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}  As a result, mixed races might be excluded in inheritance privilege and are more likely to rent homes or live in poorer neighborhoods, as well as achieve lower educational attainment compared with whites in America. Individuals with a substantial amount of wealth and inheritance often intermarry with others of the same social class to protect their wealth and ensure the continuous transmission of inheritance across generations; thus perpetuating a cycle of privilege.

Nations with the highest [[income inequality|income]] and [[wealth inequalities]] often have the highest rates of homicide and disease (such as obesity, diabetes, and hypertension) which results in high mortality rates.<ref>page 20 of "The Spirit Level"by Wilkinson & Pickett, Bloomsbury Press 2009</ref> A ''[[The New York Times]]'' article reveals that the U.S. is the world's wealthiest nation, but "ranks twenty-ninth in life expectancy, right behind Jordan and Bosnia" and "has the second highest mortality rate of the comparable OECD countries".<ref>https://www.healthsystemtracker.org/chart-collection/mortality-rates-u-s-compare-countries/#item-circulatory-diseases-mortality-1980-2015</ref> This has been regarded as highly attributed to the significant gap of inheritance inequality in the country,<ref>Dubner, Stephen. "How Big of a Deal Is Income Inequality? A Guest Post". The ''New York Times''. August 27, 2008.</ref> although there are clearly other factors such as the affordability of [[healthcare]].

When social and economic inequalities centered on inheritance are perpetuated by major social institutions such as family, education, religion, etc., these differing life opportunities are argued to be transmitted from each generation.  As a result, this inequality is believed to become part of the overall social structure.<ref>Rokicka, Ewa. "Local policy targeted at reducing inheritance of inequalities in European countries."
