{{Politics of Saudi Arabia}}
 
The '''King of Saudi Arabia''' is the monarchial [[head of state]]  and [[head of government]] of [[Saudi Arabia]] who holds absolute power. He is the head of the Saudi Arabian royal family, the [[House of Saud]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Saudi Arabia - Government and society|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Saudi-Arabia|access-date=2020-07-26|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en}}</ref> The king is called the "[[Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques]]" ({{lang|ar|خادم الحرمين الشريفين}}), a title that signifies Saudi Arabia's jurisdiction over the mosques of [[Great Mosque of Mecca|Masjid al Haram]] in [[Mecca]] and [[Al-Masjid an-Nabawi]] in [[Medina]], the title has been used many times through the history of Islam. The first Saudi monarch to use the title was [[Faisal of Saudi Arabia|King Faisal]], however, [[Khalid of Saudi Arabia|King Khaled]] did not use the title after him. In 1986, [[Fahd of Saudi Arabia|King Fahd]] replaced "[[Majesty|His Majesty]]" with the title of Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, and it has been ever since used by both [[Abdullah of Saudi Arabia|King Abdullah]] and [[Salman of Saudi Arabia|King Salman bin Abdulaziz]].<ref>{{Cite web|date=2015-01-27|title=Story behind the king’s title|url=https://www.arabnews.com/saudi-arabia/news/695351|access-date=2020-07-26|website=Arab News|language=en}}</ref>

==History==
{{further|History of Saudi Arabia}}
[[Ibn Saud|King Abdulaziz]] (known in the West as Ibn Saud) regained his patrimony, which is known as today's Saudi Arabia in 1902. Restoring his family as emirs of [[Emirate of Riyadh|Riyadh]], he then established [[Sultanate of Nejd|Nejd]] as his headquarters in 1922. Following the establishment of Riyadh as the capital of his state, King Abdulaziz then captured [[Kingdom of Hejaz|Hejaz]] 1925.<ref>{{Cite web|title=History {{!}} The Embassy of The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia|url=https://www.saudiembassy.net/history|access-date=2020-07-26|website=www.saudiembassy.net}}</ref>

Ibn Saud proclaimed his dominions as the [[Sultanate of Nejd]] in 1921, shortly before completing the unification of the region. He was proclaimed king/[[malik]] of [[Hejaz]] in 1926, and raised [[Najd|Nejd]] to a kingdom as well in 1927. For the next five years, Ibn Saud administered the two parts of his realm, the [[Kingdom of Hejaz and Nejd]] as separate units. On 23 September 1932, he formally united his territories into the [[Saudi Arabia|Kingdom of Saudi Arabia]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=About Saudi Arabia|url=https://www.sa.undp.org/content/saudi_arabia/en/home/countryinfo.html|access-date=2020-07-26|website=UNDP in Saudi Arabia|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=History of Saudi Arabia. ( The Saudi National Day 23, Sep )|url=https://www.pmu.edu.sa/students/news/2013/7b32131c-3d4a-4bc9-8ed1-f8ef1c8a07df/index|access-date=2020-07-26|website=www.pmu.edu.sa}}</ref>

==Succession==
{{further|Succession to the Saudi Arabian throne}}
The kings since Ibn Saud's death have all been his sons, and all likely immediate successors to the reigning King Salman will be from among his progeny. Sons of Ibn Saud are considered to have primary claim on the throne of Saudi Arabia.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Governance and Politics of Saudi Arabia|url=https://fanack.com/saudi-arabia/governance-and-politics-of-ksa/|access-date=2020-07-26|website=Fanack.com|language=en-US}}</ref> This makes the Saudi monarchy quite distinct from Western monarchies, which usually feature large, clearly defined [[Royal family|royal families]] and orders of succession, and use the [[absolute primogeniture]] system of succession. [[Muhammad bin Nayef]] was the first grandson of Ibn Saud to be in the line of succession before being deposed from the position of [[Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia|Crown Prince]] by a royal decree in 2017.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2017-06-21|title=Mohammed bin Salman becomes Saudi Crown Prince with 31 out of 34 votes|url=https://english.alarabiya.net/en/News/gulf/2017/06/21/Mohammed-bin-Salman-becomes-Saudi-Crown-Prince-with-majority-of-vote.html|access-date=2020-07-26|website=Al Arabiya English|language=en}}</ref>

==Legal position==
Saudi Arabia is ruled by [[Islamic law]] (Sharia) and is an [[Islamic state]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yOkYAzCl2bEC&pg=PA164|title=The Muslim world after 9/11|first=Angel|last=Rabasa|publisher=Rand Corporation|year=2004|isbn=978-0-8330-3712-1|page=164|access-date=16 May 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170211204238/https://books.google.com/books?id=yOkYAzCl2bEC&pg=PA164|archive-date=11 February 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Other functions==
The king of Saudi Arabia is also considered the head of the [[House of Saud]] and [[Prime Minister of Saudi Arabia|prime minister]]. The [[Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia|crown prince]] is also the "[[Deputy Prime Minister|deputy prime minister]]". The kings after Faisal have named a "second deputy prime minister" as the subsequent heir after the crown prince.

==Royal Standard==
{{See also|Flag of Saudi Arabia}}
The Royal Standard consists of a green flag, with an [[Arabic language|Arabic]] inscription and a sword featured in white, and with the [[Emblem of Saudi Arabia|national emblem]] embroidered in gold in the lower right canton.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Royal Standard (Saudi Arabia)|url=https://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/sa_royal.html|access-date=2020-07-28|website=www.crwflags.com}}</ref>
[[File:Royal Standard of Saudi Arabia.svg|thumb|center|220px|Royal Standard of the King {{FIAV|sinister}}]]
The script on the flag is written in the [[Thuluth|Thuluth script]]. It is the ''[[shahada]]'' or Islamic declaration of faith:

: {{lang|ar|لَا إِلٰهَ إِلَّا الله مُحَمَّدٌ رَسُولُ الله}}
: ''{{transl|ar|DIN|lā ʾilāha ʾillā-llāh, muhammadun rasūlu-llāh}}''
:''There is no other god but [[Allah]], Muhammad is the messenger of God.''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.saudiembassy.net/about/country-information/facts_and_figures/ |title=About Saudi Arabia: Facts and figures |publisher=The Royal Embassy of Saudi Arabia, Washington D.C |accessdate=24 April 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120417231457/http://www.saudiembassy.net/about/country-information/facts_and_figures/ |archive-date=17 April 2012 }}</ref>
