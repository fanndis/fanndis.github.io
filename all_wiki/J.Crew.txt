==History==
===Formation and catalog growth===
In 1947, Mitchell Cinader and Saul Charles founded Popular Merchandise, Inc., a store which did business as Popular Club Plan and sold low-priced women's clothing marketed through in-home demonstrations.<ref name="fundinguniverse.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/J-Crew-Group-Inc-Company-History.html|title=History of J. Crew Group, Inc. – FundingUniverse|website=www.fundinguniverse.com}}</ref> Throughout the mid-1980s, sales from catalog operations grew rapidly. "Growth was explosive—25 to 30 percent a year," Cinader later recollected in ''[[The New York Times]]''. Annual sales grew from $3 million to more than $100 million over five years.<ref name="fundinguniverse.com"/> In 1985, the "Clifford & Wills" brand was launched, selling women's clothing that was more affordable than the Popular Merchandise line.<ref name=latimes-spiegel/>  In 1987, two executives left the company to start their own catalog, Tweeds.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www1.excite.com/home/careers/company_profile/0,15623,117,00.html|title=Excite -|website=www1.excite.com|access-date=2011-04-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304050936/http://www1.excite.com/home/careers/company_profile/0,15623,117,00.html|archive-date=2016-03-04|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The 1980s marked a booming sales period for catalog retail giants [[Lands' End]], [[Talbots]], and [[L. L. Bean]]. Popular Merchandise initiated its own catalog operation, focusing on leisurewear for [[Upper middle class in the United States|upper-middle-class]] customers, aiming for a [[Ralph Lauren]] look at a much lower price. The first Popular Club Plan catalog was mailed to customers in January 1983 and continued under that name until 1989. Popular Club Plan catalogs often showed the same garment in more than one picture with close-up shots of the [[fabric]]s, so customers could get a sense of how the garment looked on the body and be assured of the company's claims of quality.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/books/politics-and-business-magazines/j-crew-group-inc|title=J.

===Name change and first stores===
In 1983, Popular Merchandise, Inc. became known as J.Crew, Inc. The company attempted, but failed to sell the Popular Club Plan brand.<ref name="fundinguniverse.com"/> Also in 1989, J.Crew opened its first [[retail]] store, in [[South Street Seaport]] in [[downtown Manhattan]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jcrew.com/footer/aboutus.jsp|title=Help-About J.Crew|website=www.jcrew.com}}</ref>

J.Crew Group was owned by the Cinader family for most of its existence, but in October 1997 [[investment firm]] [[Texas Pacific Group]] Inc. purchased a majority stake. By the year 2000, Texas Pacific held an approximate 62 percent stake, a group of J.Crew managers held about 10 percent, and Emily Cinader Woods, the [[chairman]] of J.Crew, along with her father, Arthur Cinader, held most of the remainder.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.referenceforbusiness.com/history2/10/J-Crew-Group-Inc.html|title=J.

===Going public and then private again===

In 2006, the company held an IPO, raising $376 million by selling new shares equal to 33% of expanded capital. However, in 2011, [[TPG Capital]] LP and [[Leonard Green & Partners]] LP took J.Crew private again in a $3 billion [[leveraged buyout]].<ref name="Reuters GSO">{{cite news|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/us-jcrew-debtrestructuring-blackstone-idUKKBN17X1KD|title=Exclusive: Blackstone's GSO snaps up J.

The announcement of the offer from two investment firms—including one that used to own J.Crew—came as the retailer reported that its third-quarter [[net income]] fell by 14 percent due to weak women's clothing sales. The company also lowered its guidance for the 2010 year. Under the deal as proposed, J.Crew [[shareholder]]s would receive $43.50 per share in cash, representing a 16 percent premium to the stock's closing price the prior day of $37.65. CEO [[Mickey Drexler]], the former [[Gap Inc.]] chief credited with turning J.Crew around since coming aboard in 2003, remained in that role and retained a "significant" stake in the company (as of September 2010, he holds 5.4% of outstanding shares).<ref>[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/J-Crew-makes-deal-to-be-taken-apf-3960554442.html?x=0&.v=8 J Crew makes deal] Yahoo Finance</ref>

In March 1989, the first J.Crew retail outlet opened in the [[South Street Seaport]] in [[Manhattan]], and the company planned to open 45 more stores. Five months after the opening of its first store, J.Crew added two new catalog lines: "Classics" and "Collections." "Collections" used more complicated designs and finer fabrics to create dressier and more expensive items, while "Classics" featured clothes that could be worn both to work and for leisure activities.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} In the fall of 1989, J.Crew opened three new stores in [[Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts]]; [[San Francisco, California]]; and [[Costa Mesa, California]], all locations with strong catalog sales. By the end of the year, retail sales nearly hit $10 million.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} Despite 1989, revenues that year were estimated at $320 million, J.Crew suffered a setback when its agreement to sell its Popular Club unit collapsed at the end that year. In addition, rumors circulated that the company's Clifford & Wills low-priced women's apparel catalog was doing poorly.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

J.Crew saw revenues reach $400 million in 1990 but reported that its four existing stores had not yet started producing enough profits to cover their overheads. The next phase of store openings included outlets in [[Philadelphia]], Cambridge, and [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]]. The company scaled back its plans for opening retail stores from 45 stores to 30 or 35.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} In early 1991 the company hired a director of new marketing development and began efforts to expand their sales into [[Canada]]. In April 1991, J.Crew mailed 75,000 J.Crew catalogs and 60,000 Clifford & Wills catalogs to potential customers in the province of [[Ontario]]. Response rates to this effort were slightly lower than in the United States, but each order, on average, was higher.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} In 1992, J.Crew intensified its push into international markets by hiring a new vice-president for international development. The company already mailed hundreds of catalogs to customers in [[Japan]] and Europe, most of whom had become acquainted with J.Crew while traveling or living in the United States.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

In an interview with the ''[[Financial Times]]'' in 2011, CEO of J.Crew [[Mickey Drexler]] said that J.Crew would be expanding to the U.K. with their flagship store being on London's [[Regent Street]].

Although a few locations were reviewed for the London store, including [[Covent Garden]] and the East End, the ultimate decision was to open on Regent Street.<ref>{{cite news |first = Vanessa|last = Friedman| title = Lunch with the FT: Mickey Drexler| url = http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/bcf99a3e-fb01-11e0-bebe-00144feab49a.html#axzz1bnxiM07u| work = [[Financial Times]]| date = 2011-10-11| accessdate = 2011-11-13}}</ref>

==Marketing==
Historically, each year the company issued 24 editions of the J.Crew catalog, distributing more than 80 million copies. Beginning in 2017, the catalog began being released with fewer pages and fewer issues per year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thecut.com/2017/06/j-crew-scaling-back-catalogs.html|title=J.Crew Is Closing About 20 Stores, Scaling Back Catalogs|first=Véronique|last=Hyland|date=June 13, 2017|website=The Cut}}</ref>

J.Crew has been criticized for labeling its new super-small jeans as "size 000".,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ctvnews.ca/health/super-small-size-000-a-new-extreme-in-marketing-clothes-1.1915982|title=Size 000|accessdate=17 July 2014}}</ref> and for advertising them as "toothpick jeans". Critics have said the labeling promotes vanity, a practice known as [[vanity sizing]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/whos-buying-j-crews-new-xxxs-clothes|title=Who's Buying J. Crew's New XXXS Clothes?|publisher=The New Yorker|last1=Merrick|first1=Amy|accessdate=8 July 2015}}</ref> The "size 000" is smaller than a [[size zero]] and has three zeros, implying that it is two sizes smaller than the smallest normal size. This has caused people to question whether negative sizes will be available in the future,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.racked.com/2014/7/2/7588563/jcrew-introduces-size-000|title=J.Crew Now Comes in Size 000.

In early 2011, J.Crew was under fire by conservative media outlets for an advertisement featuring its creative director and president, [[Jenna Lyons]], painting her son's toenails pink. Beneath the picture was a quote that read, "Lucky for me I ended up with a boy whose favorite color is pink."<ref>{{Cite web|title=J.
