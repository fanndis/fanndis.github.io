"'''I Was Here'''" is a song recorded by American [[contemporary R&B|R&B]] recording artist [[Beyoncé]] from her fourth studio album, ''[[4 (Beyoncé album)|4]]'' (2011). It was written by [[Diane Warren]], while production was handled by [[OneRepublic]] members [[Ryan Tedder]] and [[Brent Kutzle]], alongside [[Kuk Harrell]]; while Beyoncé is credited on the vocal production. "I Was Here" is a reflective [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] ballad, in which Beyoncé vulnerably reviews her past, wanting to leave an impact on the world before her life comes to an end. Described as a "career song" by Warren, its development was motivated by the [[September 11 attacks]] in the United States.

Following the release of ''4'', "I Was Here" charted at number 131 on the [[UK Singles Chart]], 74 on the [[Swiss Music Charts|Swiss Singles Chart]], and 44 on the [[Gaon Chart|South Korea Gaon International Singles Chart]] in early July 2011. Later, in 2012, the song also appeared on several charts internationally.

A [[music video]] for the song was released on August 19, 2012 and it features Beyoncé performing the song live at the [[United Nations General Assembly]] while images of volunteers doing humanitarian work were projected on the screen behind her. It was donated to the [[World Humanitarian Day]] and aimed to create social media history with one billion people sharing the message of doing something good for another person. Upon its release, it received positive reviews from music critics who praised the projections, Beyoncé's vocal performance and her look.

In late July, the song was included on the [[soundtrack]] for the 2011 [[FIFA Women's World Cup]] Final. "I Was Here" was also part of Beyoncé's [[set list]] for her residency show [[4 Intimate Nights with Beyoncé]] and was used in the [[Revel Presents: Beyoncé Live]] shows during an interlude. The live video from the DVD ''[[Live at Roseland: Elements of 4]]'' appeared online on November 16, 2011 containing Beyoncé's home movies and professional highlights. "I Was Here" was covered by [[Lea Michele]] for ''[[Glee (series)|Glee]]''{{'}}s soundtrack album ''[[Glee: The Music, The Graduation Album]]'' (2012).

On July 25, 2012 Beyoncé left a message for [[BeyHive|her fans]] on her official website stating "Leave Your Footprints on 19 August 2012", the opening lyrics to the song.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.beyonce.com/news/leave-your-footprint|title=Leave Your Footprint on 19 August 2012|publisher=Beyonce.com.

<blockquote>
"The hope, first and foremost, was to put this on people’s radar. Apart from the UN and a few newsreaders who mention this every year, people don’t even know this day exists. It’s also to make people realize it’s not just about volunteering to go and live in the Congo for four years. It’s as much about working a soup kitchen as it is helping an elderly person. Contributing something positive doesn’t have to be a lifelong commitment; it can just be daily gestures. So, it was about giving the whole issue perspective... One video and a message aren't going to save everything. But when you say things together, maybe the message will be heard and hopefully will provoke action. Inherently people are good, and inherently people are distracted and somewhat lazy, so it comes down to how do you get people’s attention."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fastcocreate.com/1681483/world-humanitarian-day-campaign-generates-one-billion-social-media-messages|title=World Humanitarian Day Campaign Generates One Billion Social Media Messages|work=[[Fast Company (magazine)|Fast Company]]|publisher=Fast Company, Inc|first=Rae|last=Ann Fera|accessdate=August 26, 2013}}</ref>

Prior to the release of the video, Beyoncé said: "We all see the headlines and we think what can I really do to help?... World Humanitarian Day is an opportunity for all of us to work together to make a difference. This is our time to leave our mark on the world and show that we were here and we care."<ref name="rapvid" /> During another interview posted on the UN website, Beyoncé said she was attracted to raising awareness on the day of recognition: "I found out that 22 people lost their lives helping people [in Baghdad]. I thought it was such an incredible thing to turn that into something positive and try to include the world into doing something great for someone else".<ref name="abc" /> Another inspiration for Beyoncé to participate in the campaign were the finalists at the [[Do Something#Do Something Awards|2012 Do Something Awards]] and their humanitarian work.<ref name="act">{{cite web|url=http://act.mtv.com/posts/beyonce-i-was-here-behind-the-scenes-world-humanitarian-day-united-nations/|title=I Was Here: Behind the Scenes at Beyonce's #WHD2012 Video Shoot at the United Nations|publisher=MTV Act.

===Mapping and projection===
[[File:UN General Assembly hall.jpg|thumbnail|270px|The UN General Assembly Hall (''pictured'') served as the filming location for the music video.]]
The video was filmed in front of a live audience at the [[United Nations General Assembly]] in New York on August 10, 2012.<ref name="digivid" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://music-mix.ew.com/2012/08/13/beyonce-performs-at-united-nations/|title=Beyonce performs at United Nations|work=The Associated Press via Entertainment Weekly|publisher=Time Inc|date=August 13, 2012|accessdate=August 14, 2012}}</ref> SuperUber worked on integration between animations and technology, the structure design and [[projection mapping]] that took over the General Assembly Hall after it was invited by Kenzo Digital. 10 20K HLM [[Barco (manufacturer)|Barco]] projectors were placed and mapping was done using [[Pandora FMS|Pandora]]'s widget designer and 5 Pandora's [[Dual Box]] servers.<ref name="createdigital" /> The final video had an 8856 x 1664 resolution and was split into 10 slices of 1080 x 1664 pixels, since each projector was turned on its side and the images were projected vertically in order to cover the whole structure.<ref name="createdigital" /> Two slices were fed into each system and SuperUber did the [[Image geometry correction|warping and edge blending]] inside Pandora. The screen which was used was over 12,000 square feet; Lucas Werthein, a representative for SuperUber commented that it was the largest indoor temporary screen that was a tilted compound curve adding that from an [[engineering]] standpoint, it is "extremely complex".<ref name="createdigital" /> It was custom-designed to mold to the inside of the General Assembly Hall. It spanned 68m X 15m and surrounded the audience with a 240 degree immersive projection.<ref name="createdigital" /> Ten synchronized and mapped projections covered the screen with 200,000 [[Lumen (unit)|lumens]], creating one continuous giant image.<ref name="createdigital" /> The screen which weighed 1000 pounds was [[Image stitching|sewn]] by forty five people. The whole structure, which was hanging off the UN ceiling weighed 6000 pounds. Werthein revealed, "In order to create the proper tension for the screen to hold its shape we had to weld permanent rigging points into the dome of the general assembly."<ref name="createdigital" /> Peter Kirn of Create Digital Motion wrote that the projection mapping was performed onto a fairly simple surface: "What makes the mapping so effective is the way in which it can fill the space, making those pictures immersive on a grand architectural scale. It makes the image a real volume in which the performance can take place."<ref name="createdigital" /> Russ Rive, SuperUber's director said, "It’s an ambitious project that has completely transformed an iconic location – seen as immutable and unchanging, with its goldplated panel and grand volume. By adding a virtual layer to it, we could digitally rebuild it, playing with the architectural elements, and therefore changing the notion of something static. The technology made the integration between animation and architecture. We used projectors to 'paint with light' the UN General Assembly’s Hall – a unique opportunity to transform such an emblematic place."<ref name="createdigital" />
