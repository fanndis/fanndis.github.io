'''First National Bank Stadium''' or simply '''FNB Stadium''', also known as '''Soccer City''' and '''The Calabash''', is a [[association football|football]] and [[Rugby union]] stadium located in [[Nasrec, Gauteng|Nasrec]], bordering the [[Soweto]] area of [[Johannesburg]], [[South Africa]]. The venue is managed by Stadium Management South Africa (SMSA)<ref>Stadium Management South Africa,[http://www.stadiummanagement.co.za/stadiums/fnb/ "FNB Stadium"], ''stadiummanagement.co.za'', June 26, 2015.

==Naming history==
The stadium has been officially known as FNB Stadium since it was opened in 1989. This was due to a [[naming rights]] deal with [[First National Bank (South Africa)|First National Bank]]. During the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]], as well as in the month before the tournament, the stadium was referred to as Soccer City. This was done as [[FIFA]] does not allow stadiums to be referred to by sponsored names during FIFA-sanctioned tournaments. The stadium's current name is FNB Stadium.

==Construction==
Built in 1987, the stadium underwent a major upgrade for the 2010 FIFA World Cup, with a new design inspired by the shape of an African pot, the [[calabash]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/world-cup/stadiums/soccer-city-johannesburg/6554681/Soccer-City-Stadium-Johannesburg-World-Cup-2010-stadium-guide.html|title=Soccer City Stadium, Johannesburg: World Cup 2010 stadium guide|date=2009-11-19|access-date=2017-12-05|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soccercity2010.co.za/news_award.asp|title=News Award|accessdate=7 December 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090804055452/http://www.soccercity2010.co.za/news_award.asp|archivedate=4 August 2009}}</ref> The South African main contractor GLTA, part of the Aveng Group in a joint venture with the Dutch company [[Koninklijke BAM Groep|BAM]] who had a 25% stake, constructed the upgrade, which was designed by [[HOK (firm)|HOK]] Sport (now known as [[Populous (company)|Populous]]) and Boogertman + Partners. The upgrade included: an extended upper tier around the stadium to increase the capacity to 88,958,<ref name="soccercityready">{{cite web|url=http://www.joburg.org.za/fifaworldcup/content/view/3428/276/ |title=Soccer City is ready for play |date=23 October 2009 |accessdate=23 March 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100309043155/http://www.joburg.org.za/fifaworldcup/content/view/3428/276/ |archivedate=9 March 2010 }}</ref> an additional 2 executive suites, an encircling roof, new changing room facilities and new floodlights.

==Stadium design==
[[File:Mandela-Memorial-FNB- 2013-12-10-2.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Inside the FNB stadium]]
The outside of the stadium is designed to have the appearance of an African pot; the cladding on the outside is a mosaic of fire and earthen colours with a ring of lights running around the bottom of the structure, simulating fire underneath the pot. No spectator is seated more than 100&nbsp;metres (330&nbsp;ft) from the field, and there are no restricted views in the stadium.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/8092181.stm|title=World Cup: One year to go |date=2009-06-11|work=BBC News|accessdate=2009-06-18}}</ref>

The stands in the FNB Stadium are articulated by ten black vertical lines; nine are aligned geographically with the nine other stadiums involved in the 2010 World Cup. Because 9 is considered to be an unlucky number in South African traditional culture,{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} a tenth line was added. This tenth line is aimed at Berlin's [[Olympic Stadium (Berlin)|Olympic Stadium]], which hosted the previous World Cup final in 2006. This represents the road to the final and it is hoped that after the World Cup, each goal scored at the stadium will be placed in pre-cast concrete panels on a podium so that the full history of the tournament's scores can be seen for years to come.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shine2010.co.za/Community/blogs/goodnews/archive/2009/10/21/take-a-seat-at-soccer-city.aspx|title=Take a seat at Soccer City|accessdate=23 March 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100419225333/http://www.shine2010.co.za/Community/blogs/goodnews/archive/2009/10/21/take-a-seat-at-soccer-city.aspx|archive-date=19 April 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref>

==Before the upgrade==
Before the upgrade, the stadium had a capacity of 80,000. The newly reconstructed stadium retains part of the original structure's west upper tier, although this and the entire lower tier were rebuilt to improve sightlines. The lower tier was completely reconstructed and divided into two segments which enabled the creation of a new lower concourse (the lower embankment concourse) linked to the existing ground level concourse.

==Major tournaments==

===1996 African Cup of Nations===
FNB Stadium served as the main venue for the tournament. It hosted the opening game, 5 other group games, a quarter final, a semi final, the 3rd place play-off and the final. The games were:

==Football==

===International football===
FNB stadium has been used by the [[South Africa national football team|South African national football team]] for both friendlies and qualification matches. It was seen as the de facto national stadium for Bafana Bafana after re-admission in 1992, who played their third ever international match there on 11 July 1992 where they drew 2-2 with Cameroon courtesy of goals from Phil and Bennett Masinga for South Africa in front of 65,000 supporters. The "old" FNB Stadium also housed the then South African Football Association (SAFA) headquarters as well as the offices of the semi-professional National Soccer League (which later traded as the professional Premier Soccer League).

[[File:FIFA World Cup 2010 Uruguay Ghana.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]] vs. [[Ghana national football team|Ghana]] at the FNB Stadium, 2 July 2010]]
The stadium has also hosted large continental club fixtures. It is largely remembered as the venue where Bafana Bafana lifted the 1996 Africa Cup of Nations when they beat Tunisia 2-0 in front of a full capacity in a match witnessed by then South African president, Nelson Mandela, his then deputy president and former South African State President, FW de Klerk, as well as Zulu monarch, King Zwelithini. The South African national football team also won their first ever trophy here when they lifted the Simba Four Nations Cup in 1995, in a competition featuring Egypt, Zambia and Zimbabwe.

The venue for the first leg of the [[1995 African Cup of Champions Clubs]] final, between [[Orlando Pirates F.C.|Orlando Pirates]] and [[ASEC Abidjan]]. The stadium has also hosted the [[CAF Super Cup]] twice. It hosted the [[1994 CAF Super Cup]], between [[Zamalek SC|Zamalek]] and [[Al-Ahly]], as well as the [[1996 CAF Super Cup]] between Orlando Pirates and [[JS Kabylie]]. In 2004, the stadium hosted final of the [[Vodacom Challenge]], between [[AS Vita Club]] and [[Kaizer Chiefs F.C.|Kaizer Chiefs]].

Some of the most memorable Bafana Bafana matches at the venue include the narrow 3-2 defeat to Brazil in 1996 as well as the country's memorable triumph when they secured passage through to a first ever World Cup appearance for the 1998 FIFA World Cup in France when they beat Republic of Congo 1-0 through a Phil Masinga strike in 1997.

During the 2010 FIFA World Cup, one of the most entertaining matches was played here in the quarterfinal stages when Uruguay beat Ghana in a penalty shootout made more memorable by a blatant handball in the last minute of the extra time by Uruguay striker [[Luis SuÃ¡rez]], which denied a Ghana and Africa a first ever semifinal appearance at the world soccer showpiece.

===Local football===
The FNB Stadium is home to Kaizer Chiefs Football Club. It is also the preferred venue for the Soweto derby football matches - the country's biggest sporting showpiece - involving Soweto based [[Premier Soccer League]] clubs, Kaizer Chiefs and Orlando Pirates. It was also the traditional home of the Iwisa Maize Meal Spectacular and later, the Telkom Charity Cup, which were charity soccer season openers in South African football from 1990 to 2006, before it was closed for renovations. The Charity Cup then returned in [[2010 Telkom Charity Cup|2010]]. The stadium was re-opened when it hosted the [[2010 Nedbank Cup]] final between [[Bidvest Wits]] and [[AmaZulu F.C. (South Africa)|Amazulu]]. The game ended, 3â€“0, to Bidvest Wits. [[Fabricio Rodrigues]] was the first player to score at the "new" Soccer City. The first league match at the stadium since being rebuilt, was a [[2010â€“11 Premier Soccer League]] match between [[Orlando Pirates F.C.|Orlando Pirates]] and [[Free State Stars]]. The first [[MTN 8]] match at the stadium was the first leg of the [[2010 MTN 8]] semifinal, between [[Orlando Pirates F.C.|Orlando Pirates]] and [[Kaizer Chiefs F.C.|Kaizer Chiefs]]. The venue has also hosted high-profile Bafana Bafana matches, including the South African national football team's 1-0 win over Spain in 2013 as well as the side's worst ever defeat when they lost 5-0 to Brazil in another international friendly in 2014. 

In May 2018, [[Mamelodi Sundowns]] hosted [[FC Barcelona]] in an exhibition match, dedicated to the late Former [[President of South Africa]] in his centenary. The match ended 3{{ndash}}1 in the favour of Barcelona.

==Rugby==
FNB stadium is a multi-purpose venue and hosted its first [[rugby union]] match in 2010, the [[2010 Tri Nations Series|Tri Nations match]] between [[South Africa national rugby union team|South Africa]] and [[New Zealand national rugby union team|New Zealand]], won by the latter. The attendance was 94,713 which is listed as the third highest rugby attendance ever in the Southern Hemisphere and a record attendance for the redeveloped stadium, until it was eclipsed on 1 August 2015, when 94,807 was recorded when Orlando Pirates played Kaizer Chiefs in the Carling Black Label Cup fixture. The stadium hosted New Zealand again in the [[2012 Rugby Championship]] on 6 October, with the All Blacks defeating the Springboks 32-16 in front of 88,739. In 2013, the Springboks defeated Argentina 73â€“13 at FNB Stadium in front of a crowd 52,867. In 2016, the venue hosted Varsity Cup rugby fixtures.
