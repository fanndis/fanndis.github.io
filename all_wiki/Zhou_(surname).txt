==History==
According to historical records, Zhou surname originates from the imperial kinsmen of the Zhou Dynasty.<ref>http://en.people.cn/200506/17/eng20050617_190843.html</ref> The original surname (''[[Chinese surname#Xing|xing]]'') of the royal Zhou family was [[Ji (surname 姬)|Ji (姬)]]. In 256 B.C., the [[Qin dynasty]] conquered Zhou and put Rufen under the jurisdiction of [[Runan County]]. Ji Yong, a descendant of [[King Ping of Zhou]], which lived on the system of [[Chinese nobility|enfeoffment]] in Rufen, changed his surname to Zhou to commemorate the merits and virtues of his ancestors. The descendants of Emperor Nan of the Zhou Dynasty, who were called the Zhou family after the Zhou Dynasty had been destroyed, also took on the Zhou surname. Since then the Zhou surname has become a common family name in Runan.

During the reign of [[Emperor Xuanzong of Tang]] Dynasty, the emperor issued an [[imperial edict]] to change the surname Ji{{cn|date=March 2020}} to Zhou to avoid the [[naming taboo|taboo]] of his personal name.

Non-Han people who adopted the name Zhou include the Helu and Pu surnames of the [[Xianbei]] nationality in (the [[Northern Zhou]]) and the Xitong and Shuhu surnames of the Mongolian nationality in the [[Yuan Dynasty]].

People with the Zhou surname could be found all over the country due to enfeoffment and migration through the ages, especially from out Runan. In general the migration of the Zhou family followed the pattern of "west to east" and "south to north".
