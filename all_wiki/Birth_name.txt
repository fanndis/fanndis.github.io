The '''birth name''' is the name of the person given upon their birth. The term may be applied to the [[surname]], the [[given name]] or to the entire name. Where births are required to be officially registered, the entire name entered onto a births register or [[birth certificate]] may by that fact alone become the person's [[legal name]].<ref name="Connexion">{{cite web|url=http://www.connexionfrance.com/france-must-use-womans-maiden-name-correspondence-15398-view-article.html|title=French administration must routinely use woman's maiden name in letters|date=27 January 2014|work=[[The Connexion]]|quote=Laws have existed since the French Revolution stating that 'no citizen can use a first name or surname other than that written on their birth certificate' – but many official organisations address both partners by the husband's surname.|access-date=1 February 2014}}</ref> The assumption in the [[Western world]] is often that the name from birth (or perhaps from [[baptism]] or ''[[brit milah]]'') will persist to adulthood in the normal course of affairs—either throughout life or until marriage. Some possible changes concern [[middle name]]s, [[diminutive]] forms, changes relating to parental status (due to one's parents' [[divorce]] or [[adoption]] by different parents), and changes related to [[gender transition]]. Matters are very different in some cultures in which a birth name is for [[childhood]] only, rather than for life.

The term ''née'', having [[feminine gender|feminine grammatical gender]], can be used to denote a woman's [[surname]] at birth that has been replaced or changed.

In [[Polish name#Multiple surnames of married women|Polish tradition]], the term ''de domo'' (literally meaning "of house" in Latin) may be used, with rare  exceptions meaning the same as ''née''.{{efn|In historical contexts "de domo" may refer to a Polish [[heraldic clan]], e.g., "Paulus de [[Glownia]] nobilis de domo [[Godzamba]]" (Paul of Glownia noble family, of [[Godziemba coat of arms]]).
