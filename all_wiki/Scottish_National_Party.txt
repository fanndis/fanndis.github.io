==History==
{{Main|History of the Scottish National Party}}

===Foundation and early breakthroughs (1934–1970)===

The SNP was formed in 1934 through the merger of the [[National Party of Scotland]] and the [[Scottish Party]], with [[James Graham, 6th Duke of Montrose|The Duke of Montrose]] and [[Robert Bontine Cunninghame Graham]] as its first, joint, president.<ref>{{cite journal| first=Robbie| last=Dinwoodie| title=From radicals and Tartan Tories to the party of government| journal=The Herald|location=Glasgow| date=7 April 2014| url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/politics/wider-political-news/from-radicals-and-tartan-tories-to-the-party-of-government.23890738| access-date=10 July 2019| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518033243/http://www.heraldscotland.com/politics/wider-political-news/from-radicals-and-tartan-tories-to-the-party-of-government.23890738| archive-date=18 May 2015| url-status=live}}</ref> [[Alexander MacEwen|Sir Alexander MacEwen]] was its first chairman.<ref>{{cite book |first1=James |last1=Mitchell |first2=Gerry |last2=Hassan |title=Scottish National Party Leaders |place=London |publisher=Biteback |year=2016 |isbn=978-1-7859-0092-1}}</ref> [[Douglas Young (classicist)|Professor Douglas Young]], who was the leader of the Scottish National Party from 1942 to 1945 campaigned for the Scottish people to refuse [[conscription]] and his activities were popularly vilified as undermining the [[Military history of the United Kingdom during World War II|British war effort]] against the [[Axis powers]]. Young was imprisoned for refusing to be conscripted.

The party suffered its first split during this period with John MacCormick leaving the party in 1942, owing to his failure to change the party's policy from supporting all-out independence to [[Devolution in the United Kingdom|Home Rule]] at that year's conference in Glasgow. McCormick went on to form the [[Scottish Covenant Association]], a non-partisan political organisation campaigning for the establishment of a devolved Scottish Assembly.

However, wartime conditions also enabled the SNP's first parliamentary success at the [[1945 Motherwell by-election|Motherwell by-election]] in 1945, but [[Robert McIntyre]] MP lost the seat at the [[1945 United Kingdom general election|general election]] three months later. The 1950s were characterised by similarly low levels of support, and this made it difficult for the party to advance. Indeed, in most general elections they were unable to put up more than a handful of candidates.

The 1960s, however, offered more electoral successes, with candidates polling credibly at [[Glasgow Bridgeton by-election, 1961|Glasgow Bridgeton]] in 1961, [[1962 West Lothian by-election|West Lothian]] in 1962 and [[1967 Glasgow Pollok by-election|Glasgow Pollok]] in 1967. Indeed, this foreshadowed [[Winnie Ewing]]'s surprise victory in [[1967 Hamilton by-election|a by-election]] at the previously safe [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] seat of [[Hamilton (UK Parliament constituency)|Hamilton]]. This brought the SNP to national prominence, leading to the establishment of the [[Royal Commission on the Constitution (United Kingdom)|Kilbrandon Commission]].

=== Becoming a major force (1970s) ===
[[File:United Kingdom general election 1974 Oct in Scotland.svg|thumb|In [[October 1974 United Kingdom general election|October 1974]] the SNP won 11 constituencies, a record that would stand until [[Nicola Sturgeon]] assumed the party's leadership.|350x350px]]
Despite this breakthrough, the [[1970 United Kingdom general election|1970 general election]] was to prove a disappointment for the party as, despite an increase in vote share, Ewing failed to retain her seat in Hamilton. The party did receive some consolation with the capture of the [[Western Isles (UK Parliament constituency)|Western Isles]], making [[Donald Stewart (MP)|Donald Stewart]] the party's only MP. This was to be the case until the [[1973 Glasgow Govan by-election|1973 by-election]] at [[Glasgow Govan (UK Parliament constituency)|Glasgow Govan]] where a hitherto safe Labour seat was claimed by [[Margo MacDonald]].

1974 was to prove something of an ''[[annus mirabilis]]'' for the party as it deployed its highly effective ''[[It's Scotland's oil]]'' campaign.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.versobooks.com/blogs/4241-dilemmas-of-over-development-scottish-nationalism-and-the-future-of-the-union|title=Dilemmas of Over-Development: Scottish Nationalism and the Future of the Union|website=Versobooks.com|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref> The SNP gained 6 seats at the [[February 1974 United Kingdom general election|February general election]] before hitting a high point in the [[October 1974 United Kingdom general election|October re-run]], polling almost a third of all votes in Scotland and returning 11 MPs to Westminster. Furthermore, during that year's [[1974 Scottish local elections|local elections]] the party claimed overall control of [[Cumbernauld and Kilsyth (district)|Cumbernauld and Kilsyth]].

This success was to continue for much of the decade, and at the [[1977 Scottish local elections|1977 district elections]] the SNP saw victories at councils including [[East Kilbride (district)|East Kilbride]] and [[Falkirk Council|Falkirk]] and held the balance of power in [[1977 Glasgow City District Council election|Glasgow]].<ref>{{Cite news|last=Faux|first=Ronald|title=Labour lose control of Glasgow|date=4 May 1977|work=The Times, p. 1}}</ref> However, this level of support was not to last and by 1978 Labour revival was evident at three by-elections ([[1978 Glasgow Garscadden by-election|Glasgow Garscadden]], [[1978 Hamilton by-election|Hamilton]] and [[1978 Berwick and East Lothian by-election|Berwick and East Lothian]]) as well as the [[1978 Scottish regional elections|regional elections]].

This was to culminate when the party experienced a large drop in its support at the [[1979 United Kingdom general election|1979 general election]], precipitated by the party [[1979 vote of no confidence in the Callaghan ministry|bringing down]] the incumbent Labour minority government following the controversial failure of that year's [[1979 Scottish devolution referendum|devolution referendum]]. Reduced to just 2 MPs, the successes of October 1974 were not to be surpassed until the [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015 general election]].

=== Factional divisions and infighting (1980s) ===
[[File:Scottish National Party 79 Group Logo.svg|left|thumb|112x112px|The [[79 Group]] sought to define the party on the [[Left-wing politics|left]]. ]]
Following this defeat, a period of internal strife occurred within the party, culminating with the formation of two internal groups: the proto-fascist [[Siol nan Gaidheal]]<ref>{{Cite book|last=Devine, T. M. (Thomas Martin)|title=The Scottish nation : a modern history|date=5 July 2012|isbn=978-0-7181-9673-8|location=London|oclc=1004568536}}</ref> and left-wing [[79 Group]]. Traditionalists within the party, centred around [[Winnie Ewing]], by this time an [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]], responded by establishing the [[Campaign for Nationalism in Scotland]] which sought to ensure that the primary objective of the SNP was campaigning for independence outwith a traditional left-right orientation, even though this would have undone the work of figures such as [[William Wolfe]], who developed a clearly [[Social democracy|social democratic]] policy platform throughout the 1970s.

These events ensured the success of a leadership motion at the party's annual conference of 1982, in [[Ayr]], despite the 79 Group being bolstered by the merger of [[Jim Sillars|Jim Sillars']] [[Scottish Labour Party (1976)|Scottish Labour Party (SLP)]] although this influx of ex-SLP members further shifted the characteristics of the party leftwards. Despite this, traditionalist figure [[Gordon Wilson (Scottish politician)|Gordon Wilson]] remained party leader through the electoral disappointments of [[1983 United Kingdom general election|1983]] and [[1987 United Kingdom general election|1987]], where he lost his own [[Dundee East (UK Parliament constituency)|Dundee East]] seat won 13 years prior.

Through this period, Sillars grew influence in the party, developing a clear socio-economic platform including ''Independence in Europe,'' reversing the SNP's previous opposition to membership of the [[European Union|then-EEC]] which had been unsuccessful in a [[1975 United Kingdom European Communities membership referendum|1975 referendum]]. This position was enhanced further by Sillars reclaiming [[Glasgow Govan (UK Parliament constituency)|Glasgow Govan]] in a [[1988 Glasgow Govan by-election|by-election]] in 1988.

Despite this moderation, the party did not join [[Scottish Labour|Labour]], the [[Scottish Liberal Democrats|Liberal Democrats]] and the [[Scottish Greens|Greens]] as well as civil society in the [[Scottish Constitutional Convention]] which developed a blueprint for a devolved [[Scottish Parliament]] due to the unwillingness of the convention to discuss independence as a constitutional option.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://thetarge.co.uk/article/current-affairs/0165/ex-mp-scotland-in-trouble-if-lax-on-constitution|title=Ex-MP: Scotland 'in trouble' if lax on constitution - The Targe|website=thetarge.co.uk|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref>

=== First Salmond era (1990s) ===
[[File:Tayside Regional Council 1994.svg|thumb|181x181px|In [[1994 Tayside Regional Council election|1994]] the SNP gained control of [[Tayside]], the only time the party controlled a regional council, albeit without a majority.]]
[[Alex Salmond]] had been elected MP for [[Banff and Buchan (UK Parliament constituency)|Banff and Buchan]] in 1987, after the re-admittance of 79 Group members, and was able to seize the party leadership after Wilson's resignation in [[1990 Scottish National Party leadership election|1990]] after a contest with [[Margaret Ewing]]. This was a surprise victory as Ewing had the backing of much of the party establishment, including Sillars and then-Party Secretary [[John Swinney]]. The defection of Labour MP [[Dick Douglas]] further evidenced the party's clear left-wing positioning, particularly regarding opposition to the [[Poll tax (Great Britain)|poll tax]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-27388579|title=Former MP Dick Douglas dies aged 82|date=2014-05-13|work=BBC News|access-date=2020-04-05|language=en-GB}}</ref> Despite this, Salmond's leadership was unable to avert a fourth successive general election disappointment in [[1992 United Kingdom general election|1992]] with the party reduced back from 5 to 3 MPs.

The mid-90s offered some successes for the party, with [[North East Scotland (European Parliament constituency)|North East Scotland]] being gained at the [[1994 European Parliament election|1994 European elections]] and the party securing a [[1995 Perth and Kinross by-election|by-election]] at [[Perth and Kinross (UK Parliament constituency)|Perth and Kinross]] in 1995 after a near-miss at [[1994 Monklands East by-election|Monklands East]] the previous year.
[[File:Scottish devolution referendum, 1997 Question 1 results.svg|left|thumb|The party was part of the successful [[History of Scottish devolution|devolution]] campaign in [[1997 Scottish devolution referendum|1997]].]]
1997 offered the party's most successful [[1997 United Kingdom general election|general election]] for 23 years, although in the face of the Labour landslide the party was unable to match either 1974 election. That September, the party joined with the other members of the [[Scottish Constitutional Convention]] in the successful Yes-Yes campaign in the [[1997 Scottish devolution referendum|devolution referendum]] which lead to the establishment of a [[Scottish Parliament]] with tax-varying powers.

By 1999, the [[1999 Scottish Parliament election|first elections]] to the parliament were being held, although the party suffered a disappointing result, gaining just 35 MSPs in the face of Salmond's unpopular '[[Kosovo]] Broadcast' which opposed [[NATO intervention in Kosovo|NATO intervention]] in the country.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/politics-anti-bombing-salmond-hits-an-all-time-low-with-voters-1086961.html|title=Politics: Anti-bombing Salmond hits an all-time low with voters|date=1999-04-13|website=The Independent|language=en|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref>

=== Opposing Labour-Liberal Democrat coalitions (1999–2007) ===
This meant that the party began as the official opposition in the parliament to a [[Dewar government|Labour-Liberal Democrat coalition government]]. Salmond found the move to a more consensual politics difficult and sought a return to Westminster, resigning the leadership in [[2000 Scottish National Party leadership election|2000]] with John Swinney, like Salmond a [[Fundamentalists and gradualists|gradualist]],<ref>{{Cite news|last=Correspondent|first=Nick Britten, Scotland Political|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1349165/Scramble-to-lead-SNP-as-Salmond-quits.html|title=Scramble to lead SNP as Salmond quits|date=2000-07-17|access-date=2020-04-05|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}</ref> victorious in the ensuring leadership election.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/uk_politics/2000/conferences/snp/938727.stm|title=BBC NEWS {{!}} In Depth {{!}} Conferences {{!}} SNP {{!}} Emphatic SNP win for Swinney|publisher=BBC|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref> Swinney's leadership proved ineffectual, with a loss of one MP in [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001]] and a further reduction to 27 MSPs in [[2003 Scottish Parliament election|2003]] despite the [[Officegate]] scandal unseating previous [[First Minister of Scotland|First Minister]] [[Henry McLeish]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/scotland/2001/mcleish_resignation/1645219.stm|title=McLeish steps down|date=2001-11-08|access-date=2020-04-05|language=en-GB}}</ref> However, the only parties to gain seats in that election where the [[Scottish Greens]] and the [[Scottish Socialist Party|Scottish Socialist Party (SSP)]] which like the SNP support independence.

===Salmond governments (2007–2014)===
[[File:Scottish Cabinet around the Cabinet Table, June 2007.jpg|thumb|The [[First Salmond government]] in the Cabinet Room.]]
In [[2007 Scottish Parliament election|2007]], the SNP emerged as the largest party in the Scottish Parliament with 47 of 129 seats, narrowly ousting the [[Scottish Labour Party]] with 46 seats and [[Alex Salmond]] becoming [[First Minister of Scotland|First Minister]] after ousting the Liberal Democrats in [[Gordon (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Gordon]]. The [[Scottish Green Party]] supported Salmond's election as First Minister, and his subsequent appointments of ministers, in return for early tabling of the [[Climate Change (Scotland) Act 2009|climate change bill]] and the SNP nominating a Green MSP to chair a parliamentary committee.<ref>{{cite news|title=SNP and Greens sign working deal|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/6646227.stm|publisher=BBC News Scotland|access-date=16 March 2013|date=11 May 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140301114950/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/6646227.stm|archive-date=1 March 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> Despite this, Salmond's minority government tended to strike budget deals with the [[Scottish Conservatives|Conservatives]] to stay in office.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Taylor|first=Brian|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-51227754|title=Could the SNP do a budget deal with the Tories?|date=2020-01-23|work=BBC News|access-date=2020-04-05|language=en-GB}}</ref>

In [[2011 Scottish Parliament election|May 2011]], the SNP won an overall majority in the Scottish Parliament with 69 seats. This was a significant feat as the [[Additional member system (Scottish Parliament)|additional member system]] used for Scottish Parliament elections was specifically designed to prevent one party from winning an outright majority.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.channel4.com/news/alex-salmonds-snp-wins-majority-in-scottish-elections |title=SNP wins majority in Scottish elections |publisher=Channel 4 |access-date=12 July 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110712205311/http://www.channel4.com/news/alex-salmonds-snp-wins-majority-in-scottish-elections |archive-date=12 July 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.snp.org/our_party|title=Our Party|work=The SNP|access-date=2017-05-10|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170609001024/https://www.snp.org/our_party|archive-date=9 June 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> This was followed by a reverse in the party's previous opposition to [[NATO]] membership at the party's annual conference in 2012<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-19993694|title=SNP votes to end anti-Nato policy|date=2012-10-19|work=BBC News|access-date=2020-04-05|language=en-GB}}</ref> despite Salmond's refusal to apologise for the Kosovo broadcast on the occasion of the [[2008 Kosovo declaration of independence|Kosovo Declaration of Independence]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/demand-for-alex-salmond-apology-over-969199|title=Demand For Alex Salmond Apology Over Kosovo|last=Dailyrecord.co.uk|date=2008-02-19|website=dailyrecord|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref>

This majority enabled the SNP government to hold a [[2014 Scottish independence referendum|referendum on Scottish independence]] in 2014. The "No" vote prevailed in a close-fought campaign, prompting the resignation of First Minister [[Alex Salmond]]. Forty-five percent of Scottish voters cast their ballots for independence, with the "Yes" side receiving less support than late polling predicted.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/sep/19/alex-salmond-resigns-first-minister-for-scotland|work=The Guardian|title=Alex Salmond resigns as first minister after Scotland rejects independence|date=19 September 2014|access-date=8 May 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403144910/http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/sep/19/alex-salmond-resigns-first-minister-for-scotland|archive-date=3 April 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> This was suggested as due to Salmond's unpopularity among women<ref>{{Cite news|last=Goldhill|first=Olivia|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/scotland/11090459/Alex-Salmonds-female-problem-or-why-most-Scottish-women-wouldnt-trust-him-to-run-a-tea-party.html|title=Alex Salmond's 'female problem' - or why most Scottish women wouldn't trust him to run a tea party|date=2014-09-11|access-date=2020-04-05|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}</ref> and Nicola Sturgeon won that [[2014 Scottish National Party leadership election|year's leadership election]] unopposed.

The SNP rebounded from the loss in the independence referendum at the [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015 UK general election]], led by [[Nicola Sturgeon]]. The party went from holding six seats in the House of Commons to 56, mostly at the expense of the Labour Party. All but three of the fifty-nine constituencies in the country elected an SNP candidate in the party's most comprehensive electoral victory at any level.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2015-scotland-32635871|work=BBC News|title=Election 2015: SNP wins 56 of 59 seats in Scots landslide|date=8 May 2015|access-date=8 May 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150521003643/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2015-scotland-32635871|archive-date=21 May 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>

At the [[2016 Scottish Parliament election|2016 Scottish election]], the SNP lost a net total of 6 seats, losing its overall majority in the Scottish Parliament, but returning for a third consecutive term as a minority government despite gaining an additional 1.1% of the constituency vote, for the party's best-ever result, from the 2011 election however 2.3% of the regional list vote. On the constituency vote, the SNP gained 11 seats from Labour, but lost the [[Edinburgh Southern (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Edinburgh Southern]] constituency to the party. The Conservatives and Liberal Democrats each gained two constituency seats from the SNP on 2011 ([[Aberdeenshire West (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Aberdeenshire West]] and [[Edinburgh Central (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Edinburgh Central]] for the Conservatives and [[Edinburgh Western (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Edinburgh Western]] and [[North East Fife (Scottish Parliament constituency)|North East Fife]] for the Liberal Democrats).
[[File:Scottish Cabinet, 2018.jpg|thumb|237x237px|[[Second Sturgeon government|Sturgeon's cabinet]] at [[Bute House]] in 2018.]]
This election was followed by the [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|2016 European Union referendum]] after which the SNP joined with the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] and [[Scottish Greens|Greens]] to call for continued membership of the EU. Despite a consequential increase in the Conservative vote at the [[2017 Scottish local elections|2017 local elections]]<ref>{{Cite news|last=Association|first=Press|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/may/06/local-elections-sturgeon-plays-down-tory-success-in-scotland|title=Local elections: Sturgeon plays down Tory success in Scotland|date=2017-05-06|work=The Guardian|access-date=2020-04-05|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> the SNP for the first time became the largest party in each of Scotland's four city councils: [[2017 Aberdeen City Council election|Aberdeen]], [[2017 Dundee City Council election|Dundee]], [[2017 City of Edinburgh Council election|Edinburgh]] and [[2017 Glasgow City Council election|Glasgow]], where a Labour administration was ousted after 37 years.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/labour-loses-glasgow-city-council-local-elections-2017-snp-scotland-brexit-general-a7719446.html|title=Labour loses control of Glasgow City Council for the first time in 40 years|date=2017-05-05|website=The Independent|language=en|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref>

At the [[2017 United Kingdom general election|2017 UK general election]] the SNP underperformed compared to polling expectations, losing 21 seats to bring their number of Westminster MPs down to 35 &ndash; however this was still the party's second best result ever at the time.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Johnson|first1=Simon|last2=Henderson|first2=Barney|title=Scotland election results: Alex Salmond defeated and SNP suffer huge losses as Tory chances boosted north of the border|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/06/08/scotland-election-results-live-will-snp-nicola-sturgeon-do/|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|date=8 June 2017|access-date=9 June 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170609041756/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/06/08/scotland-election-results-live-will-snp-nicola-sturgeon-do/|archive-date=9 June 2017|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=General election 2017: SNP lose a third of seats amid Tory surge|work=BBC News|date=9 June 2017|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-40192707|access-date=9 June 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170609030212/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-40192707|archive-date=9 June 2017|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Thomas|first1=Natalie|last2=Dickie|first2=Mure|title=Scottish election results strike blow to SNP plans for IndyRef2|url=https://www.ft.com/content/3bc5642e-4c96-11e7-919a-1e14ce4af89b|website=Financial Times|date=8 June 2017|access-date=9 June 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170611053343/https://www.ft.com/content/3bc5642e-4c96-11e7-919a-1e14ce4af89b|archive-date=11 June 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> This was largely attributed by many, including former Deputy First Minister John Swinney,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-40192707|title=General election 2017: SNP lose a third of seats amid Tory surge|date=9 June 2017|publisher=BBC|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181024045322/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-40192707|archive-date=24 October 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> to their stance on holding a [[proposed second Scottish independence referendum|second Scottish independence referendum]] and saw a swing to the Unionist parties, with seats being picked up by the Conservatives, Labour and the Liberal Democrats and a reduction in their majorities in the other seats.

High-profile losses included SNP Commons leader [[Angus Robertson]] in [[Moray (UK Parliament constituency)|Moray]] and former party leader and First Minister [[Alex Salmond]] in [[Gordon (UK Parliament constituency)|Gordon]].
[[File:Nicola Sturgeon addresses journalists over Brexit.jpg|left|thumb|245x245px|In response to [[Brexit]], Sturgeon made [[pro-Europeanism]] central to the SNP's policy.]]
The SNP went on to achieve its best-ever [[European Parliament]] result [[2019 European Parliament election in the United Kingdom|in the final election]] before [[Brexit]], the party taking its [[Member of European Parliament|MEP]] total to 3 or half of [[Scotland (European Parliament constituency)|Scottish seats]] and achieving a record vote share for the party. This was also the best performance of any party in the era of proportional elections to the European Parliament in [[Scotland (European Parliament constituency)|Scotland]]. This was suggested as being due to the party's [[Pro-Europeanism|europhile]] sentiment during what amounted to a single-issue election, with parties that lacked a clear message performing poorly, such as [[Scottish Labour|Labour]] finishing in 5th place and losing all of their Scottish MEPs for the first time.

Later that year the SNP experienced a surge in the [[United Kingdom general election, 2019|2019 general election]], winning 45.0% of the vote and 48 seats, its second-best result ever. Although the party suffered a [[North East Fife (UK Parliament constituency)|loss]] to the Liberal Democrats, it gained the [[East Dunbartonshire (UK Parliament constituency)|seat]] of its then UK leader [[Jo Swinson]], along with 7 from the Conservatives and 6 from Labour. This victory was generally attributed to Sturgeon's cautious approach regarding holding a second independence referendum and a strong emphasis on EU membership during the election.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/election-2019-50766014|title=SNP wins election landslide in Scotland|date=2019-12-13|work=BBC News|access-date=2020-04-05|language=en-GB}}</ref> Despite this, the UK-wide [[Second Johnson ministry|Conservative majority]] ensured that the UK left the EU the following January.

==Constitution and structure==
The local Branches are the primary level of organisation in the SNP. All of the Branches within each Scottish Parliament constituency form a Constituency Association, which coordinates the work of the Branches within the constituency, coordinates the activities of the party in the constituency and acts as a point of liaison between an MSP or MP and the party. Constituency Associations are composed of delegates from all of the Branches within the constituency.

The annual National Conference is the supreme governing body of the SNP and is responsible for determining party policy and electing the National Executive Committee. The National Conference is composed of:
* delegates from every Branch and Constituency Association
* the members of the National Executive Committee
* 15 members elected by the National Conference
* every SNP MSP and MP (and previously MEPs)
* several SNP local councillors, and
* delegates from one of the SNP's Affiliated Organisations ([[Young Scots for Independence]], [[SNP Students]], [[SNP Trade Union Group]] and the Association of Nationalist Councillors)

The National Council serves as the SNP's governing body between National Conferences, and its decisions are binding unless rescinded or modified by the National Conference. There are also regular meetings of the National Assembly, which provides a forum for detailed discussions of party policy by party members.

The party has an active youth wing, the [[Young Scots for Independence]], as well as a student wing, the [[Federation of Student Nationalists]]. There is also an [[SNP Trade Union Group]]. There is an independently owned monthly newspaper, ''[[The Scots Independent]]'', which is highly supportive of the party.

The SNP's leadership is vested in its National Executive Committee (NEC), which is made up of the party's elected office bearers and six elected members (voted for at conference). The SNP parliamentarians (Holyrood and Westminster) and councillors have representation on the NEC, as do the Trade Union Group, the youth wing and the student wing.

===Membership===
Since 18 September 2014 (the day of the Scottish independence referendum), party membership has more than quadrupled (from 25,642), surpassing the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] and, briefly, [[Conservatives (UK)|Conservatives]] to become the second-largest political party in the United Kingdom in terms of membership.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/theSNP/status/1036557191648604160//|title=New figures show our party is now powered by 125,482 members - making @theSNP the second biggest party in the UK.|access-date=3 September 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190524143611/https://twitter.com/theSNP/status/1036557191648604160|archive-date=24 May 2019|url-status=live}}{{Primary source inline|date=July 2020}}</ref> As of December 2018, the Party had 125,482 members.<ref name="membership2019"/>

===European affiliation===
The SNP retains close links with [[Plaid Cymru]], its counterpart in [[Wales]]. [[UK MPs|MPs]] from both parties co-operate closely with each other and work as a single parliamentary group within the House of Commons. Both the SNP and Plaid Cymru are members of the [[European Free Alliance]] (EFA), a European political party comprising [[regionalism (politics)|regionalist]] political parties. The EFA co-operates with the larger [[European Green Party]] to form [[The Greens–European Free Alliance]] (Greens/EFA) group in the [[European Parliament]].

Before its affiliation with The Greens–European Free Alliance, the SNP had previously been allied with the [[European Progressive Democrats]] (1979–1984), [[Rainbow Group (1989–1994)|Rainbow Group]] (1989–1994) and [[European Radical Alliance]] (1994–1999).

As the UK is no longer a member of the EU, the SNP has no MEPs.

The Scottish National Party did not have a clear ideological position until the 1970s, when it sought to explicitly present itself as a social democratic party in terms of party policy and publicity.<ref name="Lynch">{{cite book|author=Peter Lynch|title=SNP: The History of the Scottish National Party|year=2002|publisher= Welsh Academic Press}}</ref><ref name="Brand1978">{{cite book|title=The National Movement in Scotland|publisher=Routledge and Kegan Paul|year=1978|pages=216–17|author=Jack Brand}}</ref> During the period from its foundation until the 1960s, the SNP was essentially a moderate [[centrism|centrist]] party.<ref name="Lynch"/> Debate within the party focused more on the SNP being distinct as an all-Scotland national movement, with it being neither of the [[Left-wing politics|left]] nor the [[Right-wing politics|right]], but constituting a new politics that sought to put Scotland first.<ref name="Brand1978"/><ref name="Brand199028">{{cite book|title='Scotland', in Watson, Michael (ed.), Contemporary Minority Nationalism|publisher=Routledge|year=1990|page=28|author=Jack Brand}}</ref>

The SNP was formed through the merger of the centre-left [[National Party of Scotland]] (NPS) and the centre-right [[Scottish Party]].<ref name="Brand1978"/> The SNP's founders were united over [[self-determination]] in principle, though not its exact nature, or the best strategic means to achieve self-government. From the mid-1940s onwards, SNP policy was [[Political radicalism|radical]] and [[Redistribution of income and wealth|redistributionist]] concerning land and in favour of 'the diffusion of economic power', including the [[decentralisation]] of industries such as coal to include the involvement of local authorities and regional planning bodies to control industrial structure and development.<ref name="Lynch"/> Party policies supported the economic and social policy status quo of the post-war [[Welfare state in the United Kingdom|welfare state]].<ref name="Lynch"/><ref name="Hassan2009120">{{cite book|author=Gerry Hassan|title=The Modern SNP: From Protest to Power|year=2009|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|page=120}}</ref>

By the 1960s, the SNP was starting to become defined ideologically, with a social democratic tradition emerging as the party grew in urban, industrial Scotland, and its membership experienced an influx of social democrats from the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], the [[trade union]]s and the [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]].<ref name="Brand199032">{{cite book|title='Scotland', in Watson, Michael (ed.), Contemporary Minority Nationalism|publisher=Routledge|year=1990|page=32|author=Jack Brand}}</ref><ref name="Mitchell1996208">{{cite book|author=James Mitchell|title=Strategies for Self-government: The Campaigns for a Scottish Parliament|year=1996|publisher=Polygon|page=208}}</ref> The emergence of [[William Wolfe|Billy Wolfe]] as a leading figure in the SNP also contributed to the leftwards shift. By this period, the Labour Party were also the dominant party in Scotland, in terms of electoral support and representation. Targeting Labour through emphasising left-of-centre policies and values was therefore electorally logical for the SNP, as well as tying in with the ideological preferences of many new party members.<ref name="Mitchell1996208"/> In 1961, the SNP conference expressed the party's opposition to the siting of the [[United States|US]] [[UGM-27 Polaris|Polaris]] submarine base at the [[Holy Loch]]. This policy was followed in 1963 by a motion opposed to [[nuclear weapon]]s: a policy that has remained in place ever since.<ref name="Mitchell19961994">{{cite book|author=James Mitchell|title=Strategies for Self-government: The Campaigns for a Scottish Parliament|year=1996|publisher=Polygon|page=194}}</ref> The 1964 policy document, ''SNP & You'', contained a clear centre-left policy platform, including commitments to [[full employment]], government intervention in fuel, power and transport, a state bank to guide economic development, encouragement of [[cooperative]]s and [[credit union]]s, extensive building of [[council house]]s (social housing) by central and local government, pensions adjusted to cost of living, a [[minimum wage]] and an improved [[NHS Scotland|national health service]].<ref name="Lynch"/>

The 1960s also saw the beginnings of the SNP's efforts to establish an industrial organisation and mobilise amongst trade unionists in Scotland, with the establishment of the SNP Trade Union Group, and identifying the SNP with industrial campaigns, such as the [[Upper-Clyde Shipbuilders Work-in]] and the attempt of the workers at the Scottish ''[[Daily Express]]'' to run as a co-operative.<ref name="Lynch"/> For the party manifestos for the two 1974 general elections, the SNP finally self-identified as a social democratic party, and proposed a range of social democratic policies.<ref name="Brand199027">{{cite book|title='Scotland', in Watson, Michael (ed.), Contemporary Minority Nationalism|publisher=Routledge|year=1990|page=27|author=Jack Brand}}</ref><ref name="Hassan2009121">{{cite book|author=Gerry Hassan|title=The Modern SNP: From Protest to Power|year=2009|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|page=121}}</ref> There was also an unsuccessful proposal at the 1975 party conference to rename the party as the ''Scottish National Party (Social Democrats)''.<ref name="Hepburn2013143">{{cite book|author=Eve Hepburn|title=New Challenges for Stateless Nationalist and Regionalist Parties|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dTOOAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA143|date=18 October 2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-96596-1|page=143|access-date=25 November 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160503092815/https://books.google.com/books?id=dTOOAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA143|archive-date=3 May 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> In the UK-wide referendum on Britain's membership of the European Economic Community (EEC) in the same year as the aforementioned attempted name change, the SNP campaigned for Britain to leave the EEC.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Devenney|first=Andrew D.|year=2008|title=Regional Resistance to European Integration: The Case of the Scottish National Party, 1961-1972|journal=Historical Social Research / Historische Sozialforschung|volume=33|issue=3 (125)|pages=319–345|jstor=20762312|issn=0172-6404}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-37107148|title=The dilemma facing Scotland's Eurosceptic nationalists|last=Ley|first=Shaun|date=2016-08-18|access-date=2020-01-12|language=en-GB}}</ref>

There were further ideological and internal struggles after 1979, with the [[79 Group]] attempting to move the SNP further to the left, away from being what could be described a "social-democratic" party, to an expressly "[[Socialism|socialist]]" party. Members of the 79 Group – including future party leader and [[First Minister of Scotland|First Minister]] [[Alex Salmond]] – were expelled from the party. This produced a response in the shape of the [[Campaign for Nationalism in Scotland]] from those who wanted the SNP to remain a "broad church", apart from arguments of left vs. right. The 1980s saw the SNP further define itself as a party of the political left, such as campaigning against the introduction of the [[community charge|poll tax]] in Scotland in 1989; one year before the tax was imposed on the rest of the UK.<ref name="Lynch"/>

Ideological tensions inside the SNP are further complicated by arguments between the so-called [[SNP gradualist]]s and [[SNP fundamentalist]]s. In essence, gradualists seek to advance Scotland to independence through further devolution, in a "step-by-step" strategy. They tend to be in the moderate left grouping, though much of the [[79 Group]] was gradualist in approach. However, this 79 Group gradualism was as much a reaction against the fundamentalists of the day, many of whom believed the SNP should not take a clear left or right position.<ref name="Lynch"/>

===Economic policies ===

With the SNP's policy base being mostly in the mainstream Western European [[social democracy|social democratic]] tradition, the party is committed to policies such as [[progressive tax|progressive personal taxation]]. This vision was achieved by the [[Second Sturgeon government|Sturgeon Government]] in 2017, reducing income tax rates for a slight majority of the population by shifting the tax burden to the wealthier.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-42356953|title=Scottish income tax changes unveiled|date=2017-12-14|work=BBC News|access-date=2020-04-10|language=en-GB}}</ref> Previously the party had replaced the flat rate [[Stamp duty in the United Kingdom|Stamp Duty]] with the [[Land and Buildings Transaction Tax|LBTT]], which is founded on progressive principles.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-32129904|title=New property tax comes into effect|date=2015-04-01|work=BBC News|access-date=2020-04-10|language=en-GB}}</ref> Whilst in government, the party was also responsible for the establishment of [[Revenue Scotland]] to administer devolved taxation.

Having previously defined itself in opposition to the [[Poll tax (Great Britain)|poll tax]]<ref name="Lynch" /> the SNP has also championed progressive taxation at a local level. Despite pledging to introduce a [[Local income tax in Scotland|local income tax]]<ref>{{Cite news|last1=Carrell|first1=Severin|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/feb/11/alex-salmond-snp-local-income-tax|title=Alex Salmond drops flat-rate local income tax plan|date=2009-02-11|work=The Guardian|access-date=2020-04-10|last2=correspondent|first2=Scotland|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> the [[First Salmond government|Salmond Government]] found itself unable to replace the [[Council Tax in Scotland|council tax]] and the party has, particularly since the ending of the council tax freeze<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.holyrood.com/news/view,nicola-sturgeon-confirms-end-to-council-tax-freeze-as-those-living-in-more-_6572.htm|title=Nicola Sturgeon confirms end to council tax freeze as those living in more expensive homes face higher bills|date=2019-10-03|website=Holyrood Website|language=en|access-date=2020-04-10}}</ref> under Nicola Sturgeon's leadership, committing to increasing the graduated nature of the tax.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-37837010|title=MSPs vote to raise council tax bands|date=2016-11-03|work=BBC News|access-date=2020-04-10|language=en-GB}}</ref> Conversely, the party has also supported capping and reducing [[Business rates in Scotland|Business Rates]] in an attempt to support small businesses.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-41244487|title=Scottish business rate reforms confirmed|date=2017-09-12|work=BBC News|access-date=2020-04-10|language=en-GB}}</ref>

It has been noted that the party contains a broader spectrum of opinion regarding economic policy than most political parties in the UK due to its status as "the only viable vehicle for Scottish independence",<ref name=splits>{{cite web |url=http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/staggers/2017/03/5-biggest-splits-behind-snps-disciplined-facade |title=5 of the biggest splits behind the SNP's disciplined facade |last=Millar |first=James |date=16 March 2017 |website=[[New Statesman]] |access-date=21 August 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170408171758/http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/staggers/2017/03/5-biggest-splits-behind-snps-disciplined-facade |archive-date=8 April 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref> with the party's parliamentary group at Westminster including socialists such as [[Tommy Sheppard]] and [[Mhairi Black]], capitalists such as [[Stewart Hosie]] and former Conservative, [[Tasmina Ahmed-Sheikh]].<ref name=splits /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/staggers/2016/10/snp-cant-mask-its-left-right-split-forever |title=The SNP can't mask its left-right split forever |last=Millar |first=James |date=13 October 2016 |website=[[New Statesman]] |access-date=21 August 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170408171658/http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/staggers/2016/10/snp-cant-mask-its-left-right-split-forever |archive-date=8 April 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>

=== Constitution policies ===
[[File:Queen Elizabeth II in March 2015.jpg|left|thumb|204x204px|The SNP is neutral on the continuance of the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|monarchy]].]]
The foundations of the SNP are a belief that [[Scotland]] would be more prosperous by being governed [[Scottish independence|independently]] from the [[United Kingdom]], although the party was defeated in the [[2014 Scottish independence referendum|2014 referendum]] on this issue.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-29270441|title=Scotland votes 'No' to independence|date=2014-09-19|work=BBC News|access-date=2020-04-10|language=en-GB}}</ref> The party has since sought to hold a [[Proposed second Scottish independence referendum|second referendum]] at some point in the future, perhaps related to the outcome of [[Brexit]],<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-51311288|title=Nicola Sturgeon calls for patience over indyref2|date=2020-01-31|work=BBC News|access-date=2020-04-10|language=en-GB}}</ref> as the party sees a [[Independence referendum|referendum]] as the only route to independence. The party is [[Constitutionalism|constitutionalist]] and as such rejects holding such a referendum [[Unilateral declaration of independence|unilaterally]] or any course of actions that could lead to comparisons with cases such as [[Catalan declaration of independence|Catalonia]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.politicshome.com/news/article/nicola-sturgeon-rules-out-catalanstyle-rogue-independence-referendum|title=Nicola Sturgeon rules out Catalan-style rogue independence referendum|date=2020-02-25|website=Politics Home|language=en|access-date=2020-04-10}}</ref> with the party seeing independence as a process that should be undertaken through a consensual process alongside the [[Government of the United Kingdom|UK Government]]. As part of this process towards independence, the party supports increased [[Devolution in the United Kingdom|devolution]] to the [[Scottish Parliament]] and the [[Scottish Government]], particularly in areas such as [[welfare]] and [[immigration]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/smith-commission-snp-will-argue-more-powers-1519352|title=Smith Commission: SNP 'will argue for more powers'|website=The Scotsman|language=en|access-date=2020-04-10}}</ref>

Official SNP policy is supportive of the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|monarchy]] however members are divided on the issue. The party does propose reducing the funds spent on the royal family.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://inews.co.uk/news/uk/nicola-sturgeon-snp-debate-monarchy-future-prince-andrew-jeffrey-epstein-1327736|title=Nicola Sturgeon says 'there is a debate to be had' on the future of the monarchy|website=inews.co.uk|language=en|access-date=2020-04-10}}</ref> Separately, the SNP has always opposed the UK's [[House of Lords|unelected upper house]] and would like to see both it and the [[House of Commons]] elected by a form of [[proportional representation]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/the-snp-would-vote-to-introduce-proportional-representation-at-westminster-nicola-sturgeon-confirms-10223302.html|title=The SNP would vote for proportional representation at Westminster, Nicola Sturgeon confirms|date=2015-05-04|website=The Independent|language=en|access-date=2020-04-10}}</ref> The party also supports the introduction of a [[Constitution|written constitution]], either for an independent Scotland or the UK as a whole,<ref>{{Cite news|last=Drummond|first=John|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/scotland-blog/2012/jun/21/scotland-constitution|title=Scottish National party must 'grasp thistle' of a written constitution before referendum|date=2012-06-21|work=The Guardian|access-date=2020-04-10|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> going as far as producing a proposed interim constitution for Scotland during the independence referendum campaign.<ref>{{Cite news|last1=Carrell|first1=Severin|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/jun/16/scottish-constitution-first-draft-issued-nicola-sturgeon|title=SNP publishes draft of first constitution for an independent Scotland|date=2014-06-16|work=The Guardian|access-date=2020-04-10|last2=correspondent|first2=Scotland|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>

=== Fundamentalists and gradualists ===
With how to achieve [[Scottish independence|independence]], the party was traditionally split between [[fundamentalists and gradualists]].

The SNP leadership generally subscribe to the gradualist viewpoint, that being the idea that [[Scottish independence]] can be won by the accumulation by the [[Scottish Parliament]] of powers that the [[UK Parliament]] currently has over time. It is also a philosophy that emphasises the election of an SNP government should bring about trust in the Scottish people in the ability to govern themselves, thus bringing increased support for independence.

Fundamentalism stands in opposition to the so-called gradualist point of view, which believes that the SNP should emphasise independence more widely to achieve it. The argument goes that if the SNP is unprepared to argue for its central policy then it is unlikely ever to persuade the public of its worthiness.<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|last1=Seenan|first1=By Gerard|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1999/may/06/uk.politicalnews1|title=SNP's radical wing threatens to split party|date=1999-05-06|work=The Guardian|access-date=2020-01-02|last2=MacAskill|first2=Ewen|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>
