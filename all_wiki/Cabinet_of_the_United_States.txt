{{Politics of the United States}}

The '''Cabinet of the United States''' is part of the [[Executive branch of the United States|executive branch]] of the [[federal government of the United States]]. The members of the Cabinet are the [[Vice President of the United States|vice president of the United States]] and the heads of the [[United States federal executive departments|federal executive departments]], all of whom—if eligible—are in the [[United States presidential line of succession|presidential line of succession]].

The [[Constitution of the United States]] does not explicitly establish a Cabinet. The Cabinet's role, inferred from the language of the [[Opinion Clause]] (Article&nbsp;II, Section&nbsp;2, Clause&nbsp;1) of the Constitution, is to serve as the principal advisory body to the [[president of the United States]]. Additionally, the [[Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-fifth Amendment]] authorizes the vice president, together with a majority of certain members of the Cabinet, to declare the president "unable to discharge the powers and duties of his or her office".

Members of the Cabinet (except for the vice president) are appointed by the president, subject to confirmation by the Senate; once confirmed, they serve [[Powers of the president of the United States|at the pleasure of the president]], who can dismiss them at any time without the approval of the Senate, as affirmed by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] in ''[[Myers v. United States]]'' (1926). All federal public officials, including Cabinet members, are also subject to [[Impeachment in the United States|impeachment]] by the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] and trial in the [[United States Senate|Senate]] for "treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors", as per Article II, Section 4. 

The president can also unilaterally designate senior advisers from the [[Executive Office of the President]] and heads of [[Independent agencies of the United States government|other federal agencies]] as members of the Cabinet, although this is a symbolic status marker and does not, apart from attending Cabinet meetings, confer any additional powers.

==History==
[[File:State-dining-room-polk-cabinet.jpg|left|[[James K. Polk]] and his Cabinet in 1845: the first Cabinet to be photographed.|thumb]]
[[File:President Nixon with his first term cabinet.jpg|left|The [[Richard Nixon|Nixon]] Cabinet, 1970|thumb]]
[[File:President Barack Obama with full cabinet 09-10-09.jpg|left|The first [[Barack Obama|Obama]] Cabinet (September 2009)|thumb]]

The tradition of the Cabinet arose out of the debates at the 1787 [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|Constitutional Convention]] regarding whether the president would exercise executive authority solely or collaboratively with a [[Cabinet (government)|cabinet of ministers]] or a [[privy council]]. As a result of the debates, the Constitution (Article&nbsp;II, Section&nbsp;1, Clause&nbsp;1) vests "all executive power" in the president singly, and authorizes—but does not compel—the president (Article&nbsp;II, Section&nbsp;2, Clause&nbsp;1) to "require the Opinion, in writing, of the principal Officer in each of the executive Departments, upon any Subject relating to the Duties of their respective Offices".<ref>{{cite web| last=Prakash| first=Sai| title=Essays on Article II:Executive Vesting Clause| url=https://www.heritage.org/constitution/#!/articles/2/essays/76/executive-vesting-clause| work=The Heritage Guide to The Constitution| publisher=The Heritage Foundation| accessdate=July 3, 2018| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180701142803/https://www.heritage.org/constitution/#!/articles/2/essays/76/executive-vesting-clause| archive-date=July 1, 2018| url-status=live| df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref name=A2EssayGaziano>{{cite web| last=Gaziano| first=Todd| title=Essays on Article II: Opinion Clause| url=https://www.heritage.org/constitution/#!/articles/2/essays/88/opinion-clause| work=The Heritage Guide to The Constitution| publisher=The Heritage Foundation| accessdate=July 3, 2018| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180701142803/https://www.heritage.org/constitution/#!/articles/2/essays/88/opinion-clause| archive-date=July 1, 2018| url-status=live| df=mdy-all}}</ref> The Constitution does not specify what the executive departments will be, how many there will be, or what their duties will be.

[[George Washington]], the first president of the United States, organized his principal officers into a Cabinet, and it has been part of the executive branch structure ever since. Washington's Cabinet consisted of five members: himself, [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[Thomas Jefferson]], [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|Secretary of the Treasury]] [[Alexander Hamilton]], [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] [[Henry Knox]] and [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] [[Edmund Randolph]]. [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[John Adams]] was not included in Washington's Cabinet because the position was initially regarded as a legislative officer (president of the Senate).<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.mountvernon.org/library/digitalhistory/digital-encyclopedia/article/john-adams/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=May 17, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180517153631/http://www.mountvernon.org/library/digitalhistory/digital-encyclopedia/article/john-adams/ |archive-date=May 17, 2018 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref> It was not until the 20th century that vice presidents were regularly included as members of the Cabinet and came to be regarded primarily as a member of the executive branch.

Presidents have used Cabinet meetings of selected principal officers but to widely differing extents and for different purposes. Secretary of State [[William H. Seward]] and then-professor [[Woodrow Wilson]] advocated the use of a parliamentary-style Cabinet government. But President [[Abraham Lincoln]] rebuffed Seward, and Woodrow Wilson would have none of it in his administration. In recent administrations, Cabinets have grown to include key White House staff in addition to department and various agency heads. President [[Ronald Reagan]] formed seven sub-cabinet councils to review many policy issues, and subsequent presidents have followed that practice.<ref name=A2EssayGaziano/>

==Federal law==
In {{usc|3|302}} with regard to delegation of authority by the president, it is provided that "nothing herein shall be deemed to require express authorization in any case in which such an official would be presumed in law to have acted by authority or direction of the president." This pertains directly to the heads of the executive departments as each of their offices is created and specified by statutory law (hence the presumption) and thus gives them the authority to act for the president within their areas of responsibility without any specific delegation.

Under the 1967 {{usc|5|3110|pipe=Federal Anti-Nepotism statute}}, federal officials are prohibited from appointing their immediate family members to certain governmental positions, including those in the Cabinet.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.stetson.edu/law/lawreview/media/congressional-interference-with-the-presidents-power-to-appoint-24-3.pdf|title=Congressional Interference With The President's Power To Appoint|first1=Richard P.|last1=Wulwick|first2=Frank J.|last2=Macchiarola|journal=Stetson Law Review|volume=XXIV|year=1995|pages=625–652|access-date=November 15, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161116101457/http://www.stetson.edu/law/lawreview/media/congressional-interference-with-the-presidents-power-to-appoint-24-3.pdf|archive-date=November 16, 2016|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

Under the [[Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998]], an administration may appoint acting heads of department from employees of the relevant department. These may be existing high-level career employees, from political appointees of the outgoing administration (for new administrations), or sometimes lower-level appointees of the administration.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.propublica.org/article/who-runs-departments-before-heads-are-confirmed-090122|title=Who Runs Departments Before Heads Are Confirmed?|last=Pierce|first=Olga|date=2009-01-22|newspaper=ProPublica|language=en|access-date=2017-01-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202000058/https://www.propublica.org/article/who-runs-departments-before-heads-are-confirmed-090122|archive-date=February 2, 2017|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

==Confirmation process==
[[File:Top Left Cabinet Image.png|thumb|A map showing the historical makeup of the Cabinet of the United States by year.]]
The heads of the executive departments and all other federal agency heads are nominated by the president and then presented to the Senate for [[Appointments Clause|confirmation or rejection]] by a [[Majority|simple majority]] (although before the use of the "[[nuclear option]]" during the [[113th United States Congress]], they could have been blocked by [[filibuster]], requiring [[cloture]] to be invoked by {{frac|3|5}} [[supermajority]] to further consideration). If approved, they receive their commission scroll, are [[Oath of office|sworn in]] and then begin their duties.

An elected vice president does not require Senate confirmation, nor does the [[White House Chief of Staff|White House chief of staff]], which is an appointed staff position of the [[Executive Office of the President of the United States|Executive Office of the President]].
