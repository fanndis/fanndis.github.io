==At ''The Guardian''==
At ''The Guardian'', she was responsible for launching the Guardian's media website<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/global/2000/dec/19/janine-gibson "Janine Gibson Profile"], theguardian.com [19 December 2000]</ref> and became Media Guardian editor.

==''Guardian''{{'}}s American website==
After several months of discussion with Alan Rusbridger in early 2011, Gibson was formally appointed the editor of the Guardian's new American online operations, to be based in New York, in April. The newspaper's new US website was launched in September;<ref name="Pompeo"/> an earlier attempt by the newspaper to relate to an American online audience, headed by [[Michael Tomasky]] in Washington DC between 2007 and 2009, had proved unsuccessful.<ref name="Witt">Emily Witt [http://observer.com/2011/06/the-guardian-in-america-is-going-to-be-british-this-time/ "The Guardian in America Is Going to Be British This Time"], ''New York Observer'', 27 June 2011</ref>

[[Glenn Greenwald]] brought the leaked material from [[Edward Snowden]] to Gibson's attention, and she formed the team who met Snowden in Hong Kong to analyse the material he had accumulated.<ref>Nicky Woolf [https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2013/07/how-i-the-guardian-i-broke-the-snowden-story/277486/ "How The Guardian Broke the Snowden Story"], ''The Atlantic'', 5 July 2013</ref>

Gibson continued to be Greenwald's supervising editor during the time he was associated with ''The Guardian'' and preparing Snowden's [[Pulitzer Prize]] winning<ref>https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/15/business/media/coverage-of-snowden-and-boston-attack-win-pulitzer-prizes.html</ref> revelations about [[National Security Agency|NSA]] surveillance and other stories for publication.<ref>Ken Auletta [https://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2013/10/07/131007fa_fact_auletta "Annals of Communication: Freedom of Information"], ''New Yorker'', 7 October 2013</ref> She is reported to have told Alan Rusbridger when informing him of the scoops Greenwald, their newspaper's columnist, had uncovered: "I’ve got a little story to chat to you about".<ref>Christine Haughney and Noam Cohen [https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/11/business/guardian-reaps-benefits-from-nsa-scoop.html?_r=0 "Guardian Makes Waves, and Is Ready for More"], ''New York Times'', 10 June 2013</ref>

After returning to London, Gibson became chief of theguardian.com website during Summer 2014 becoming in addition a deputy editor of Guardian News & Media.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/guardian-us-press-office/guardian-senior-editorial-changes "Guardian News & Media announces senior editorial changes"], theguardian.com (press release), 6 March 2014</ref> Her place as head of ''The Guardian''{{'s}} American operations was taken by [[Katharine Viner]].<ref>Ravi Somaiya [https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/07/business/media/guardian-to-make-management-changes.html "Guardian to Make Management Changes"], ''New York Times'', 6 March 2014</ref>

Gibson was offered a managing editor of digital media position with ''[[The New York Times]]'' in early May 2014, but turned it down. According to one report in ''[[The New Yorker]]'', internal politics related to her potential hiring led to the dismissal of that paper's executive editor, [[Jill Abramson]] a few weeks later.<ref>{{cite news|title=Jill Abramson and the Times: What Went Wrong?|author=Ken Auletta|publisher=[[The New Yorker]]|date=2014-05-14}}</ref> Gibson was perceived to be the most likely successor to Alan Rusbridger, who resigned as editor-in-chief in December 2014, but [[Katharine Viner]] was ultimately appointed in March 2015.<ref>Harry Lambert [http://www.newstatesman.com/media/2014/12/who-will-replace-alan-rusbridger-guardian "Who will replace Alan Rusbridger at the Guardian?"], ''New Statesman'', 10 December 2014</ref><ref>Henry Mance [http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/c4b68c40-ce49-11e4-9712-00144feab7de.html#axzz3VmvrvJvX "Katharine Viner appointed Guardian editor"], ''Financial Times'', 20 March 2015</ref>

In May 2015, Gibson left ''The Guardian''.<ref>Alex Spence [http://www.politico.eu/article/janine-gibson-to-leave-the-guardian/ "Snowden editor to leave ''The Guardian''"], ''Politico'', 22 May 2015</ref>

==BuzzFeed UK==
In September 2015, prior to an expansion of its activities, she was appointed as editor-in-chief of the ''[[BuzzFeed]]'' UK website.<ref name="Martinson"/><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeedpress/buzzfeed-appoints-janine-gibson-editor-in-chief-buzzfeed-uk|title=BuzzFeed Appoints Janine Gibson Editor-In-Chief, BuzzFeed UK|work=BuzzFeed|access-date=2018-05-11|language=en}}</ref>

Under her editorship the website moved into more hard news and published an investigative series<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/heidiblake/from-russia-with-blood-14-suspected-hits-on-british-soil|title=From Russia With Blood|work=BuzzFeed|access-date=2018-05-11|language=en}}</ref> in which 14 suspicious UK deaths (and 1 US) were found to have links to the Kremlin. The series triggered [[Theresa May]]’s government to commit to a full review, was a Pulitzer Prize finalist and [[George Clooney]] has picked it up for a film. In early 2018, the website also published a previously unseen [[Brexit]] analysis <ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/albertonardelli/the-governments-own-brexit-analysis-says-the-uk-will-be|title=The Government's Own Brexit Analysis Says The UK Will Be Worse Off In Every Scenario Outside The EU|work=BuzzFeed|access-date=2018-05-11|language=en}}</ref> which stated the UK would be worse off in every scenario, further cementing its place as a news powerhouse.

''BuzzFeed UK'' won News Website of the Year in 2017 at the Press Awards.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.pressawards.org.uk/page-view.php?pagename=winners-2017|title=Press Awards|last=Ltd|first=Magstar|website=www.pressawards.org.uk|language=EN-GB|access-date=2018-05-11}}</ref>
