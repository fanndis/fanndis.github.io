The '''decolonisation of Africa''' took place in the mid-to-late 1950s to 1975, with sudden and radical regime changes on the continent as [[Colonialism|colonial]] governments made the transition to [[Sovereign state|independent states]]; this was often quite unorganized and marred with violence and political turmoil. There was widespread unrest, with organized revolts in both northern and sub-Saharan colonies including the [[Algerian War]] in [[French Algeria]], the [[Angolan War of Independence]] in [[Portuguese Angola]], the [[Congo Crisis]] in the [[Belgian Congo]], and the [[Mau Mau Uprising]] in [[Kenya Colony|British Kenya]].<ref>John Hatch, ''Africa: The Rebirth of Self-Rule'' (1967)</ref><ref>William Roger Louis, ''The transfer of power in Africa: decolonization, 1940-1960'' (Yale UP, 1982).</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Birmingham|first=David|year=1995|title=The Decolonization of Africa|publisher=Routledge|isbn=1-85728-540-9}}</ref><ref>John D.

The "[[Scramble for Africa]]" between 1870 and 1900 ended with almost all of Africa being controlled by a small number of European states. Racing to secure as much land as possible while avoiding conflict amongst themselves, the partition of Africa was confirmed in the [[Berlin Conference|Berlin Agreement]] of 1885, with little regard to local differences.<ref>{{cite web|title= Berlin Conference of 1884-1885|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780195337709.001.0001/acref-9780195337709-e-0467|website=www.oxfordreference.com |accessdate=11 January 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=A Brief History of the Berlin Conference|url=http://teacherweb.ftl.pinecrest.edu/snyderd/MWH/Projects/mun-bc/History.htm|website=teacherweb.ftl.pinecrest.edu|accessdate=11 January 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180215122624/http://teacherweb.ftl.pinecrest.edu/snyderd/MWH/Projects/mun-bc/history.htm|archive-date=15 February 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref> By 1905, control of almost all African soil was claimed by Western European governments, with the only exceptions being [[Liberia]] (which had been settled by [[African-American]] former slaves) and [[Ethiopian Empire|Ethiopia]] (then [[Italian Ethiopia|occupied by Italy]] in 1936).<ref>{{cite web|last1=Evans|first1=Alistair|title=Countries in Africa Considered Never Colonized|url=http://africanhistory.about.com/od/eracolonialism/tp/AfricaNotColon.htm|website=africanhistory.about.com|accessdate=11 January 2015}}</ref> [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]] and [[French Third Republic|France]] had the largest holdings, but [[German Empire|Germany]], [[Spain under the Restoration|Spain]], [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]], [[Belgium]], and [[History of Portugal (1834–1910)|Portugal]] also had colonies. As a result of [[colonialism]] and [[imperialism]], a majority of Africa lost sovereignty and control of natural resources such as gold and rubber. The introduction of imperial policies surfacing around local economies led to the failing of local economies due to an exploitation of resources and cheap labor.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title=The World Transformed 1945 to the Present|last=Hunt|first=Michael|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2017|isbn=9780199371020|location=New York|pages=264}}</ref> Progress towards independence was slow up until the mid-20th century.

==Causes==

===External causes===
During the world wars, African soldiers were conscripted into imperial militaries.<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/history/world-war-one/inside-first-world-war/part-five/10542773/non-european-involvement-war.html], "The call of the Empire, the call of the war", ''Telegraph''.</ref> This led to a deeper political awareness and the expectation of greater respect and self-determination, which was left largely unfulfilled.<ref>Ferguson, Ed, and A. Adu Boahen. (1990). "African Perspectives On Colonialism." ''The International Journal Of African Historical Studies'' 23 (2): 334. doi:10.2307/219358.</ref> During the 1941 Atlantic Conference, the British and the US leaders met to discuss ideas for the post-war world. One of the provisions added by President Roosevelt was that all people had the right to [[self-determination]], inspiring hope in [[British colonies]].<ref name="selfstudyhistory.com" />

On February&nbsp;12,&nbsp;1941, United States President [[Franklin&nbsp;D. Roosevelt]] and British Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] met to discuss the postwar world. The result was the [[Atlantic Charter]].<ref>{{cite web|title=The Atlantic Conference & Charter, 1941|url=https://history.state.gov/milestones/1937-1945/atlantic-conf|website=history.state.gov |quote="The Atlantic Charter was a joint declaration released by U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Winston Churchill on August 14, 1941 following a meeting of the two heads of state in Newfoundland."|accessdate=26 January 2015}}</ref> It was not a treaty and was not submitted to the [[British Parliament]] or the [[Senate of the United States]] for ratification, but it turned out to be a widely acclaimed document.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Karski|first1=Jan|title=The Great Powers and Poland: From Versailles to Yalta|date=2014|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|isbn=9781442226654|page=330|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1zelAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA330|accessdate=24 June 2014}}</ref> One of the provisions, introduced by Roosevelt, was the autonomy of imperial colonies. After [[World War II]], the US and the African colonies put pressure on Britain to abide by the terms of the Atlantic Charter. After the war, some Britons considered African colonies to be childish and immature; British colonisers introduced democratic government at local levels in the colonies. Britain was forced to agree but Churchill rejected universal applicability of self-determination for subject nations. He also stated that the Charter was only applicable to German occupied states, not to the British Empire.<ref name="selfstudyhistory.com"/>

Furthermore, colonies such as [[Colonial Nigeria|Nigeria]], [[French Senegal|Senegal]] and [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Ghana]] pushed for self-governance as colonial powers were exhausted by war efforts.<ref>Assa, O. (2006). A History of Africa. Volume 2. Kampala East Africa Education Publisher ltd.</ref>

===Internal causes===
For early African nationalists, decolonisation was a moral imperative. In 1945 the [[Fifth Pan-African Congress]] demanded the end of colonialism. Delegates included future presidents of [[Ghana]], [[Kenya]], [[Malawi]] and national activists.<ref>[http://www.un.org/africarenewal/magazine/august-2010/‘wind-change’-transformed-continent], A ‘Wind Of Change’ That Transformed The Continent | Africa Renewal Online. 2017. Un.Org.</ref>

Colonial economic exploitation led to European extraction of Ghana's mining profits to shareholders, instead of internal development, causing major local socioeconomic grievances.<ref>[Boahen, A. (1990) Africa Under Colonial Domination, Volume 7]</ref> Nevertheless, local African industry and towns expanded when U-boats patrolling the [[Atlantic Ocean]] reduced raw material transportation to Europe.<ref name="selfstudyhistory.com"/> In turn, urban communities, industries and trade unions grew, improving literacy and education, leading to pro-independence newspaper establishments.<ref name="selfstudyhistory.com"/>

Indeed, in the 1930s, the colonial powers had cultivated, sometimes inadvertently, a small elite of leaders educated in Western universities and familiar with ideas such as [[self-determination]]. In some cases where the road to independence was fought, settled arrangements with the colonial powers were also being placed.<ref name=":0" /> These leaders came to lead the struggles for independence, and included leading [[African nationalism|nationalists]] such as [[Jomo Kenyatta]] ([[Kenya]]), [[Kwame Nkrumah]] ([[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast]], now [[Ghana]]), [[Julius Nyerere]] ([[Tanganyika]], now [[Tanzania]]), [[Léopold Sédar Senghor]] ([[Senegal]]), [[Nnamdi Azikiwe]] ([[Nigeria]]), and [[Félix Houphouët-Boigny]] ([[Côte d'Ivoire]]).{{citation needed|reason=No citation for claim.|date=January 2015}}

==Economic legacy==
There is an extensive body of literature that has examined the legacy of colonialism and colonial institutions on economic outcomes in Africa, with numerous studies showing disputed economic effects of colonialism.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Michalopoulos|first=Stelios|last2=Papaioannou|first2=Elias|date=2020-03-01|title=Historical Legacies and African Development|url=https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/jel.20181447|journal=Journal of Economic Literature|language=en|volume=58|issue=1|pages=53–128|doi=10.1257/jel.20181447|issn=0022-0515}}</ref>

The economic legacy of colonialism is difficult to quantify and is disputed. [[Modernisation theory]] posits that colonial powers built infrastructure to integrate Africa into the [[world economy]], however, this was built mainly for extraction purposes. African economies were structured to benefit the coloniser and any surplus was likely to be ‘drained’, thereby stifling [[capital accumulation]].<ref name="Bertocchia, G. 2002">Bertocchia, G. & Canova, F., (2002) Did colonization matter for growth? An empirical exploration into the historical causes of Africa's underdevelopment. European Economic Review, Volume 46, pp. 1851-1871</ref> [[Dependency theory]] suggests that most African economies continued to occupy a subordinate position in the world economy after independence with a reliance on primary commodities such as copper in [[Zambia]] and tea in [[Kenya]].<ref>Vincent Ferraro, "Dependency Theory: An Introduction," in The Development Economics Reader, ed. Giorgio Secondi (London: Routledge, 2008), pp. 58-64</ref> Despite this continued reliance and unfair trading terms, a [[meta-analysis]] of 18 African countries found that a third of countries experienced increased economic growth post-independence.<ref name="Bertocchia, G. 2002" />

==Social legacy==

===Language===
Scholars including Dellal (2013), Miraftab (2012) and Bamgbose (2011) have argued that Africa's linguistic diversity has been eroded. Language has been used by western colonial powers to divide territories and create new identities which has led to conflicts and tensions between African nations.<ref>IMF Country Report No. 17/80 (2017). Article Iv Consultation - Press Release; Staff Report; And Statement By The Executive Director For Nigeria.</ref>

===Law===
In the immediate post-independence period, African countries largely retained colonial legislation. However, by 2015 much colonial legislation had been replaced by laws that were written locally.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Berinzon |first1=Maya |last2=Briggs |first2=Ryan |date=1 July 2016 |title=Legal Families Without the Laws: The Fading of Colonial Law in French West Africa |journal=American Journal of Comparative Law |volume=64| issue=2 |pages=329–370 |doi=10.5131/AJCL.2016.0012}}</ref> This is a kind of decolonization of the law.

==Transition to independence==
{{Further|Neocolonialism}}
Following World War II, rapid decolonisation swept across the continent of Africa as many territories gained their independence from European colonisation.

In August 1941, United States President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] and British Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] met to discuss their post-war goals. In that meeting, they agreed to the [[Atlantic Charter]], which in part stipulated that they would, "respect the right of all peoples to choose the form of government under which they will live; and they wish to see sovereign rights and self government restored to those who have been forcibly deprived of them."<ref>"Atlantic Charter", August 14, 1941, https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/official_texts_16912.htm</ref> This agreement became the post-WWII stepping stone toward independence as nationalism grew throughout Africa.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

Consumed with post-war debt, European powers were no longer able to afford the resources needed to maintain control of their African colonies. This allowed for African nationalists to negotiate decolonisation very quickly and with minimal casualties. Some territories, however, saw great death tolls as a result of their fight for independence.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

==British Empire==
[[File:British Empire in 1959.png|thumb|upright=2|British Empire by 1959]]

===Ghana===
{{Main|History of Ghana}}
On 6 March 1957, Ghana (formerly the [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast]]) became the first sub-Saharan African country to gain its independence from European colonisation.<ref>Esseks, John D. "Political independence and economic decolonisation: the case of Ghana under Nkrumah." Western Political Quarterly 24.1 (1971): 59-64.</ref> Starting in 1945 [[Pan-African Congress]], Gold Coast's British- and American-educated independence leader [[Kwame Nkrumah]] made his focus clear.  In the conference's declaration, he wrote, “we believe in the rights of all peoples to govern themselves. We affirm the right of all colonial peoples to control their own destiny. All colonies must be free from foreign imperialist control, whether political or economic.”<ref>Nkrumah, Kwame, ''Fifth Pan-African Congress, Declaration to Colonial People of the World'' (Manchester, England, 1945).</ref>
[[File:British Decolonisation in Africa.png|thumb|upright=1.7|British decolonisation in Africa. By 1970 all were decolonised.]]

In 1949, the conflict would ramp up when British troops opened fire on African protesters.  Riots broke out across the territory and while Nkrumah and other leaders ended up in prison, the event became a catalyst for the independence movement.  After being released from prison, Nkrumah founded the [[Convention People's Party|Convention People's Party (CPP)]], which launched a mass-based campaign for independence with the slogan ‘Self Government Now!’”<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ghana.gov.gh/index.php/media-center/features/2888-political-party-activity-in-ghana-1947-to-1957|title=POLITICAL PARTY ACTIVITY IN GHANA—1947 TO 1957 - Government of Ghana|website=www.ghana.gov.gh|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-04-24}}</ref> Heightened nationalism within the country grew their power and the political party widely expanded.  In February of 1951, the [[Convention People's Party]] gained political power by winning 34 of 38 elected seats, including one for Nkrumah who was imprisoned at the time. London revised the Gold Coast Constitution to give Blacks a majority in the legislature in 1951.  In 1956 they requested independence inside the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]], which was granted peacefully in 1957 with Nkrumah as prime minister and [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] as sovereign.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Daniel Yergin|author2=Joseph Stanislaw|title=The Commanding Heights: The Battle for the World Economy|publisher=Simon and Schuster|url=https://archive.org/details/commandingheight00yerg_1|url-access=registration|year=2002|page=[https://archive.org/details/commandingheight00yerg_1/page/66 66]}}</ref>

Britain's remaining colonies in Africa, except for [[Southern Rhodesia]], were all granted independence by 1968. British withdrawal from the southern and eastern parts of Africa was not a peaceful process. Kenyan independence was preceded by the eight-year [[Mau Mau Uprising]]. In [[Rhodesia]], the 1965 [[Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence|Unilateral Declaration of Independence]] by the white minority resulted in a [[Rhodesian Bush War|civil war]] that lasted until the [[Lancaster House Agreement]] of 1979, which set the terms for recognised independence in 1980, as the new nation of [[Zimbabwe]].<ref>James, pp.&nbsp;618–21.</ref>

The French colonial empire began to fall during the [[Second World War]] when the Vichy France regime controlled the Empire. But one after another most of the colonies were occupied by foreign powers (Japan in Indochina, Britain in [[Syria]], Lebanon, and [[Madagascar]], the United States and Britain in [[Morocco]] and [[Algeria]], and Germany and Italy in [[Tunisia]]). However, control was gradually reestablished by [[Charles de Gaulle]], who uses colonial base as a launching point to expel Vichy from Metropolitan France. De Gaulle together with most Frenchmen was committed to preserving the Empire in the new form.  The [[French Union]], included in the [[French Constitution of 1946|Constitution of 1946]], nominally replaced the former colonial empire, but officials in Paris remained in full control. The colonies were given local assemblies with only limited local power and budgets. There emerged a group of elites, known as evolués, who were natives of the overseas territories but lived in metropolitan France.<ref>Patrick Manning,  ''Francophone Sub-Saharan Africa 1880-1995'' (1998) pp 135-63.</ref><ref>Guy De Lusignan, ''French-speaking Africa since independence'' (1969) pp 3-86.</ref><ref>Rudolph von, ''Decolonization: the Administration and Future of the Colonies, 1919-1960'' (1971), 265-472.</ref>

De Gaulle assembled a [[Brazzaville Conference|major conference of Free France colonies]] in Brazzaville, in Africa, in January–February, 1944. The survival of France depended on support from these colonies, and De Gaulle made numerous concessions. They included the end of forced labor, the end of special legal restrictions that apply to natives but not to whites, the establishment of elected territorial assemblies, representation in Paris in a new "French Federation", and the eventual representation of Sub-Saharan Africans in the French Assembly. However, Independence was explicitly rejected as a future possibility: 
:The ends of the civilizing work accomplished by France in the colonies excludes any idea of autonomy, all possibility of evolution outside the French bloc of the Empire; the eventual Constitution, even in the future of self-government in the colonies is denied.<ref>Tony Smith, 
"A Comparative Study of French and British Decolonization" ''Comparative Studies in Society and History'' 20#1 (1978), pp. 70-102, quoting page 73</ref>

===Conflict===
France was immediately confronted with the beginnings of the [[decolonisation]] movement. In Algeria demonstrations in May 1945 were [[Setif and Guelma massacre|repressed]] with an estimated 6,000 Algerians killed.<ref>{{cite book |last=Horne |first=Alistair |author-link=Alistair Horne |year=1977 |title=A Savage War of Peace: Algeria 1954–1962 |location=New York |publisher=The Viking Press |page=27}}</ref> Unrest in Haiphong, Indochina, in November 1945 was met by another warship bombarding the city.<ref>J.F.V.

French officials estimated the number of Malagasy killed from a low of 11,000 to a French Army estimate of 89,000.<ref>Anthony Clayton, ''The Wars of French Decolonization'' (1994) p 85</ref>

In France's African colonies, [[Cameroun]], the [[Union of the Peoples of Cameroon]]'s insurrection, started in 1955 and headed by [[Ruben Um Nyobé]], was violently repressed over a two-year period, with perhaps as many as 100 people killed.{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}}

===Algeria===
{{Main|Algerian War}}
French involvement in [[Algeria]] stretched back a century. [[Ferhat Abbas]] and [[Messali Hadj]]'s movements had marked the period between the two wars, but both sides radicalised after the Second World War. In 1945, the [[Sétif massacre]] was carried out by the French army.  The [[Algerian War of Independence|Algerian War]] started in 1954. [[Torture during the Algerian War of Independence|Atrocities characterized both sides]], and the number killed became highly controversial estimates that were made for propaganda purposes.<ref>{{cite book|author=Martin S.

===French Community===
[[File:EU OCT and OMR map en.png|thumb|upright=2.75|The [[Special member state territories and the European Union|special territories of the European Union]] c. 2011]]
The [[French Union]] was replaced in the new 1958 [[French Constitution of 1958|Constitution of 1958]] by the [[French Community]]. Only [[Guinea]] refused by referendum to take part in the new colonial organisation. However, the French Community dissolved itself in the midst of the Algerian War; almost all of the other African colonies were granted independence in 1960, following local referendums. Some few colonies chose instead to remain part of France, under the status of [[French overseas departments and territories|overseas ''départements'' (territories)]]. Critics of [[neocolonialism]] claimed that the ''[[Françafrique]]'' had replaced formal direct rule. They argued that while de Gaulle was granting independence on one hand, he was creating new ties with the help of [[Jacques Foccart]], his counsellor for African matters. Foccart supported in particular the [[Nigerian Civil War]] during the late 1960s.<ref>Dorothy Shipley White, ''Black Africa and de Gaulle: From the French Empire to Independence'' (1979).</ref>

Robert Aldrich argues that with Algerian independence in 1962, it appeared that the Empire practically had come to an end, as the remaining colonies were quite small and lacked active nationalist movements. However, there was trouble in French Somaliland ([[Djibouti]]), which became independent in 1977. There also were complications and delays in the New Hebrides [[Vanuatu]], which was the last to gain independence in 1980. [[New Caledonia]] remains a special case under French suzerainty.<ref>Robert Aldrich,  ''Greater France: A history of French overseas expansion'' (1996) pp 303–6</ref> The Indian Ocean island of [[Mayotte]] voted in referendum in 1974 to retain its link with France and forgo independence.<ref>"[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/comorosandmayotte/5072354/Mayotte-votes-to-become-Frances-101st-dpartement.html Mayotte votes to become France's 101st département]".
