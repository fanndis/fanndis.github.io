'''Merton London Borough Council''' is the local authority for the [[London Borough of Merton]] in [[Greater London]], [[England]]. It is one of the 32 [[London Councils|councils]] that form Greater London.

==History==
[[File:Merton London UK labelled ward map 2002.svg|thumb|A map showing the wards of Merton since 2002]]
There were previously a number of local authorities responsible for the Merton area. The current local authority was first elected in 1964, a year before formally coming into its powers and prior to the creation of the [[London Borough of Merton]] on 1 April 1965. Merton replaced the [[Municipal Borough of Mitcham]], the [[Municipal Borough of Wimbledon]] and the [[Merton and Morden Urban District]], all formerly within [[Surrey]].<ref>{{cite book | first=Frederic |last=Youngs | title=Guide to the Local Administrative Units of England | volume=I: Southern England | year=1979 | publisher=[[Royal Historical Society]] | location=London | isbn=0-901050-67-9}}</ref>

It was envisaged, in accordance with the London Government Act 1963, that Merton as a London local authority would share power with the [[Greater London Council]]. The split of powers and functions meant that the Greater London Council was responsible for "wide area" services such as fire, ambulance, flood prevention, and refuse disposal; with the local authorities responsible for "personal" services such as social care, libraries, cemeteries and refuse collection. This arrangement lasted until 1986 when London Borough Councils gained responsibility for some services that had been provided by the [[Greater London Council]], such as [[Waste disposal authorities in London|waste disposal]]. Since 2000 the [[Greater London Authority]] has taken some responsibility for highways and planning control from the council, but within the [[Local government in England|English local government system]] the council remains a "most purpose" authority in terms of the available range of powers and functions.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YX0nAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA107&lpg=|title=Local Government Reorganisation: The Review and its Aftermath|first= Steve |last=Leach|page=107|publisher=Routledge|year=1998|isbn=978-0714648590}}</ref>

==Powers and functions==
The local authority derives its powers and functions from the London Government Act 1963 and subsequent legislation. Merton has the powers and functions of a London borough council. It is a [[Billing authorities in England|billing authority]] collecting Council Tax and business rates, it processes local planning applications, and it is responsible for [[Council house|housing]], waste collection and environmental health. It is a [[local education authority]], responsible for social services, libraries and waste disposal. The council shares responsibility with the [[Greater London Authority]] for strategic policies including housing, planning and the environment.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.london.gov.uk/what-we-do/planning/who-we-work/local-plan-responses-within-and-outside-london|title=Local Plan Responses – within and outside London|publisher=Mayor of London|accessdate=9 April 2020}}</ref>

==Finances==
Merton London Borough Council is the [[Billing authorities in England|billing authority]] for Council Tax, and collects a [[precept]]s on behalf of the [[Mayor's Office for Policing and Crime]], the [[London Fire and Emergency Planning Authority]] the [[Greater London Authority]] and [[Transport for London]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://counciltaxrates.info/councils|title=Council Tax and Business Rates Billing Authorities|publisher=Council Tax Rates|accessdate=8 April 2020}}</ref>

==Political background of the council==
{{main|Merton local elections}}
Merton is divided into 20 wards, each electing three councillors. The political voting patterns in Merton broadly follow the geographical divide between Merton's two UK Parliament constituencies.

The eastern [[Mitcham and Morden (UK Parliament constituency)|Mitcham and Morden constituency]], which is held by Labour MP [[Siobhain McDonagh]], contains ten wards and has only ever elected Labour councillors.

The western [[Wimbledon (UK Parliament constituency)|Wimbledon constituency]], which is held by [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] MP [[Stephen Hammond]], contains ten wards and generally elects Conservative councillors, of which there are presently 17. Since 1990, the ward of Merton Park has only ever returned councillors for [[Merton Park Ward Residents Association]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mertonpark.org.uk/|title=Merton Park Ward Residents Association|website=www.mertonpark.org.uk|access-date=19 April 2017}}</ref> Since 1994, the ward of West Barnes, which contains Merton's half of the town of [[Motspur Park]], has swung between the Conservatives and the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]]; the latter presently hold all three seats in the ward.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.merton.gov.uk/resstatsborough1994.pdf|title=London Borough of Merton Local Elections Statistics 1994|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120831110843/http://www.merton.gov.uk/resstatsborough1994.pdf|archive-date=2012-08-31|url-status=dead|access-date=19 April 2017 <!-- 12.35 UTC -->}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.merton.gov.uk/elections-may2002.pdf|title=Merton London Borough Council Election Results, 2002|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120831110515/http://www.merton.gov.uk/elections-may2002.pdf|archive-date=2012-08-31|url-status=dead|access-date=19 April 2017 <!-- 12.35 UTC -->}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.merton.gov.uk/council/voting/electionresults/electionresults-history/electionresults-2010.htm|title=Council election results 2010|last=Services|first=CS - Electoral|website=www.merton.gov.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-04-19}}</ref><ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://democracy.merton.gov.uk/mgElectionResults.aspx?ID=15&V=1&RPID=506739148|title=Merton Council Elections 2018 Wards Summary|date=3 May 2018|website=democracy.merton.gov.uk|language=en|access-date=7 May 2018}}</ref> In the [[2018 Merton London Borough Council election|local elections in 2018]], Liberal Democrat councillors were elected in the wards of Trinity and Dundonald for the first time in the borough's history, bringing the party's seat numbers to a record of six seats.

==Mayors==
At the Annual Council Meeting, a mayor is elected to serve for a year. At the same time, the Council elects a deputy mayor. Since 1978, each Mayor must also be an elected councillor.

The Mayor also acts as the ceremonial and civic head of the borough during his/her year of office and the post is non-political. Each year the Mayor also chooses two charities which will benefit from a series of fundraising events throughout the mayoral year.
