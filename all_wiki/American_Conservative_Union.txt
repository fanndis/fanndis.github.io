The '''American Conservative Union''' ('''ACU''') is an American [[political organization]] that advocates for [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] policies, ranks politicians based on their level of conservatism, and organizes the [[Conservative Political Action Conference]]. Founded on 18 December 1964, it calls itself the oldest ongoing conservative [[Lobbying|lobbying organization]] in the U.S.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://conservative.org/who-we-are/|title=American Conservative Union {{!}} Who We Are|website=conservative.org|access-date=2016-10-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161019202226/http://conservative.org/who-we-are/|archive-date=October 19, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> The ACU is concerned with what they define as foundations of conservatism, issues such as [[personal liberty]] or [[freedom]], [[foreign policy]], and [[traditional values]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://conservative.org/foundations-of-conservatism/|title=American Conservative Union {{!}} Foundations of Conservatism|website=conservative.org|access-date=2016-10-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161020015809/http://conservative.org/foundations-of-conservatism/|archive-date=October 20, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>

== Activities ==
The ACU comprises three entities: The American Conservative Union, a [[501(c)(4)]] organization which conducts lobbying; The American Conservative Union Foundation, a [[501(c)(3)]] organization best known for hosting the Conservative Political Action Conference; and The American Conservative Union Political Action Committee, a PAC that formally endorses and funds conservative candidates for federal office.{{cn|date=July 2018}}

=== Congressional ratings ===
Dating back to 1971, ACU has implemented its own scoring system which annually rates politicians on their conservatism.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://acuratings.conservative.org/|title=ACU Ratings|website=ACU Ratings|access-date=January 8, 2018}}</ref> While the scorecard was novel to conservatism, [[Americans for Democratic Action]] has utilized a liberal rubric for liberalism since 1947.<ref name=":4" /><ref name=":8">{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/rightnationconse00mick|url-access=registration|page=[https://archive.org/details/rightnationconse00mick/page/n18 5]|quote=american conservative union.|title=The Right Nation: Conservative Power in America|last1=Micklethwait|first1=John|last2=Wooldridge|first2=Adrian|date=2004-01-01|publisher=Penguin|isbn=9781594200205|language=en}}</ref>

Each publication of Congressional and State Ratings contains a statement from Chairman [[Matt Schlapp]] about the philosophy guiding the ratings as one of conservatism: "We begin with our philosophy (conservatism is the political philosophy that sovereignty resides in the person) and then apply our understanding of government (its essential role is to defend life, liberty, and property)."<ref>http://acuratings.conservative.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2017/06/Virginia_2017.pdf</ref>

Unlike other congressional ratings that take positions on pending legislation, ACU Foundation rates votes already cast by lawmakers. Each rating provides a conservative interpretation of an official's view of governance. As one spokesperson for the ACU once noted, "clear-cut distinctions between liberals and conservatives [occur] if you have [[Phil Crane|Crane]], [[John M. Ashbrook|Ashbrook]], and [[Jack Kemp|Kemp]] go a certain way and [[Phillip Burton|Burton]] goes the other".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Fowler|first=Linda L.|date=1982-01-01|title=How Interest Groups Select Issues for Rating Voting Records of Members of the U. S. Congress|jstor=439365|journal=Legislative Studies Quarterly|volume=7|issue=3|pages=401–413|doi=10.2307/439365}}</ref>

The ACU annually rates politicians according to how they vote on key issues, providing a numerical indicator of how much the lawmakers agreed with conservative ideals. They use this rating system as a point of accountability for politicians, comparing their political rhetoric to their voting records to assess their conservativeness.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://conservative.org/what-we-do/|title=American Conservative Union {{!}} What We Do|website=conservative.org|access-date=2016-10-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161019202550/http://conservative.org/what-we-do/|archive-date=October 19, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> Politicians are given a percentile rating, anyone with a rating of over 80% is considered to be an "ACU Conservative".<ref>{{Cite press release|url=http://stewart.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/stewart-named-top-conservative-by-american-conservative-union|title=Stewart Named Top Conservative By American Conservative Union|date=April 3, 2014|publisher=Congressman Chris Stewart|access-date=October 12, 2016}}</ref> These scores are often used in [[political science]] research, in news stories and in election campaigns.

=== Conservative Political Action Conference ===
ACU's most well-known event is the [[Conservative Political Action Conference]] (CPAC), an annual event organized by the ACU foundation.<ref name=":8" /> CPAC has an annual attendance of thousands.  Speakers regularly include sitting and former presidents and other famous conservatives. CPAC 2017 featured President [[Donald Trump]], Vice President [[Mike Pence]], Senator [[Ted Cruz]] (R-TX), Governors [[Matt Bevin]] (R-KY), [[Sam Brownback]] (R-KS), [[Doug Ducey]] (R-AZ), and [[Scott Walker (politician)|Scott Walker]] (R-WI) and executive branch officials (EPA Administrator [[Scott Pruitt]] and Education Secretary [[Betsy DeVos]]).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/2/21/14677782/cpac-2017-keynote-speakers-schedule|title=President Trump and his most controversial appointees will address conservatism's biggest conference|first=Jeff|last=Stein|date=February 21, 2017|website=Vox}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://heavy.com/news/2017/02/cpac-2017-speakers-full-list-headliners-donald-trump-mike-pence-steve-bannon-schedule-dates/|title=CPAC 2017 Speakers List: Headliners Include Donald Trump, Mike Pence & Steve Bannon|first=Daniel S.|last=Levine|date=February 22, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mediaite.com/online/here-is-the-schedule-for-cpac-2017/|title=LIST OF SPEAKERS AND SCHEDULE FOR CPAC 2017|date=February 22, 2017}}</ref>

=== American Conservative Union Foundation ===
The ACU Foundation's purpose is to educate the public on conservative principles and currently has five "policy centers" which focus on different political areas. There is the Center for Arts & Culture, the Center for Human Dignity, the Center for Statesmanship & Diplomacy, the Center for 21st Century Property Rights, and the Center for Criminal Justice Reform (CCJR). These policy centers are mainly blogs which post articles regarding their topic area.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://acufoundation.conservative.org/|publisher=The American Conservative Union|title=Home|website=acufoundation.conservative.org|access-date=2016-12-11}}</ref> The most extensive of these is the CCJR, who advocate for conservative criminal justice reform through advising governmental officials, media advocacy, and testifying as expert witnesses at governmental hearings. The CCJR focuses on two main policy areas: preventing civil [[asset forfeiture]] and increasing mental health facilities within the criminal justice system. The CCJR works with the [[Texas Public Policy Foundation]] and Prison Fellow Ministries in the [[Right on Crime]] campaign, and offers a panel at the Conservative Political Action Conference each year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://acufoundation.conservative.org/center-for-criminal-justice-reform/|publisher=The American Conservative Union|title=Center for Criminal Justice Reform|website=acufoundation.conservative.org|access-date=2016-12-11}}</ref>

== History ==

=== Founding ===
The American Conservative Union was one of many conservative organizations formed in the 1960s as part of the resurgence of conservatism.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Durham|first=Martin|date=1985-03-20|title=Family, Morality and the New Right|url=http://pa.oxfordjournals.org/content/38/2/180|journal=Parliamentary Affairs|language=en|volume=38|issue=2|pages=180–191|issn=0031-2290}}</ref> As conservative activist [[M. Stanton Evans]] predicted, "Historians may well record the decade of the 1960s as the era in which conservatism, as a viable political force, finally came into its own."<ref>{{cite book |title=Revolt on the campus |last=Evans |first=M. Stanton |date=1961-01-01 |publisher=Chicago |hdl = 2027/mdp.39015000534472|isbn=0-313-21160-4}}</ref> During a time of increasing polarization between liberals and conservatives, activists began to build a well-organized conservative movement, forming organizations such as [[Young Americans for Freedom]] and the ACU.<ref name=":1">{{Cite journal|last=Hijiya|first=James A.|date=2003-01-01|title=The Conservative 1960s|jstor=27557328|journal=Journal of American Studies|volume=37|issue=2|pages=201–227|doi=10.1017/S0021875803007072}}</ref> During this era, conservative groups focused less on direct action and more on long term planning and sought to gain positions in public office.<ref name=":1" />

The ACU was founded in December 1964 in response to the predominance of liberalism in America as evidenced by the defeat of [[Barry Goldwater]]'s presidential campaign.<ref name=":5">{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofpo0000carl |url-access=registration |page=[https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofpo0000carl/page/509 509] |quote=american conservative union foreign policy. |title=Encyclopedia of Politics: The Left and the Right|last=Carlisle|first=Rodney P.|date=2005-03-17|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=978-1-4522-6531-5|language=en}}</ref> Founders included [[Frank Meyer (political philosopher)|Frank S. Meyer]], [[William F Buckley Jr]], and [[Robert Bauman|Robert E. Bauman]], who organized the first meeting.<ref name=":5" /> In the initial meetings, a 50-member board of directors was appointed, whose members included Lammot Copeland, Peter O'Donnell, John A. Howard, [[Donald C. Bruce]], and [[John Dos Passos]].<ref name=":5" /> Membership grew to 7,000 within 9 months, and 45,000 by the end of 1972.<ref name=":5" />

As part of ACU's mission to unite conservatives, William F. Buckley and Robert Bauman led an initiative to declare ACU's views of the John Birch Society. ACU's founding documents state that, {{Quote |text=There is no relation between the two organizations. The directors of the ACU take a view of world affairs substantially at variance with that taken by Mr. Robert Welch in his most publicized writing. Under the circumstances, the leadership of the ACU will be wholly distinct from that of the John Birch Society.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Schoenwald|first1=Jonathan|title=A Time for Choosing: The Rise of Modern American Conservatism|url=https://archive.org/details/timeforchoosingr00scho|url-access=limited|date=2001|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=0-19-513473-7|page=[https://archive.org/details/timeforchoosingr00scho/page/n243 234]}}</ref>}}

Conservatives' view of the Birchers became a national storyline when Buckley continued to criticize the Birchers in his ''National Review'' column.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nationalreview.com/2017/06/william-f-buckley-john-birch-society-history-conflict-robert-welch/|title=The Inside Story of William F.

=== Foreign policy influence ===
The ACU spent roughly $1.4 million opposing the ratification of the [[Torrijos–Carter Treaties|Panama Canal treaties]] in 1977.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lGMYDAAAQBAJ&q=panama+canal+treaty+%22american+conservative+union%22&pg=PA326|title=The Politics of Arms Control Treaty Ratification|last1=Krepon|first1=M.|last2=Caldwell|first2=D.|date=2016-04-30|publisher=Springer|isbn=9781137045348|language=en}}</ref> They used a mass mailing campaign, sending out around 2.4 million letters.<ref>{{cite journal|jstor=40574653|title=Leadership, Orientation, and Rhetorical Vision: Jimmy Carter, the 'New Right,' and the Panama Canal|last1=Smith|first1=Craig Allen|journal=Presidential Studies Quarterly|year=1986|volume=16|issue=2|pages=317–328}}</ref> This brought in roughly $15,000 a day in support of conservative candidates who opposed the treaties.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/phyllis_cri_2005_00_7649|url-access=registration|page=[https://archive.org/details/phyllis_cri_2005_00_7649/page/258 258]|quote=American Conservative Union.|title=Phyllis Schlafly and Grassroots Conservatism: A Woman's Crusade|last=Critchlow|first=Donald T.|date=2005-01-01|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=0691070024|language=en}}</ref> They also produced a thirty-minute-long television ad which aired on 150 television station in eighteen states, and took out newspaper ads in thirty states, encouraging citizens to write to their senators to oppose the treaties.<ref name=":7">{{Cite journal|last=Skidmore|first=David|date=1993-01-01|title=Foreign Policy Interest Groups and Presidential Power: Jimmy Carter and the Battle over Ratification of the Panama Canal Treaties|jstor=27551108|journal=Presidential Studies Quarterly|volume=23|issue=3|pages=477–497}}</ref>  The ACU also helped to fund a "truth squad," formed by Senator [[Paul Laxalt]], whose purpose was to "focus renewed public interest in the treaties" and pressure senators to vote against the treaties.<ref name=":7" /> Gary Jarmin, who was at the time Legislator of the ACU, stated that the Panama Canal Treaties were "a good issue for the conservative movement. It's not just the issue itself we're fighting for. This is an excellent opportunity to seize control of the Republican Party."<ref name=":7" />

In 1980, the ACU estimated that it would cost roughly $1.8 million to defeat [[Strategic Arms Limitation Talks|SALT II]]; together with other conservative groups, SALT opponents outspent supporters 15:1.<ref name=":2">{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/peddlersofcrisis0000sand|url-access=registration|quote=peddlers of crisis.|title=Peddlers of Crisis: The Committee on the Present Danger and the Politics of Containment|last=Sanders|first=Jerry Wayne|date=1983-01-01|publisher=South End Press|isbn=9780896081819|language=en}}</ref> Having found the technique of mass mailing to be successful during other campaigns, the ACU used this same technique to oppose SALT II, reaching roughly 500,000 people with this strategy.<ref name=":2" /> Additionally, they produced a half-hour-long anti-SALT television program called ''Soviet Might/American Myth: The United States in Retreat'', which was aired on 200 television stations around the country.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/roadstodominionr00diamrich|url-access=registration|page=[https://archive.org/details/roadstodominionr00diamrich/page/137 137]|quote=american conservative union anti-salt.|title=Roads to Dominion: Right-wing Movements and Political Power in the United States|last=Diamond|first=Sara|date=1995-01-01|publisher=Guilford Press|isbn=9780898628647|language=en}}</ref><ref name=":4">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qvsgKCaaY6oC&q=american+conservative+union+anti-salt&pg=PA271|title=Right Star Rising: A New Politics, 1974-1980|last=Kalman|first=Laura|date=2010-06-28|publisher=W.

In 1985, the ACU sent out roughly 100,000 pieces of mail in support of [[Contras|Nicaraguan contra]] aid in 1985.<ref name=":3">{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/publicdimensiono00news|url-access=registration|page=[https://archive.org/details/publicdimensiono00news/page/212 212]|quote=american conservative union support for contras.|title=The Public Dimension of Foreign Policy|last=Newsom|first=David D.|date=1996-01-01|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=0253329604|language=en}}</ref> They also escorted Nicaraguan refugees around Capital Hill in order to persuade undecided politicians to support Reagan's contra aid request.<ref name=":3" />

== Lobbying in the 21st century ==
According to the [[Center for Responsive Politics]], the American Conservative Union spent roughly $20,000 on lobbying in 2001, $400,000 in 2003, and $1,100,000 in 2005.<ref name="opensecrets.org">{{Cite web|url=https://www.opensecrets.org/federal-lobbying/clients/summary?cycle=2019&id=D000023944|title=American Conservative Union Lobbying Profile|website=OpenSecrets}}</ref> They did not spend any money on lobbying in 2004.

Recurring lobbyists are Lorenz Hart and Amir Iljazi.<ref name="opensecrets.org"/>

== Controversies ==

=== FedEx ===
In 2009, ACU offered [[FedEx]] the option of paying as much as $3.4 million for e-mail and other services for "an aggressive grass-roots campaign" to stop a legislative provision being considered by the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]].<ref name="ACUtoFedEX">{{cite web |url=http://www.politico.com/static/PPM130_fedex_grassroots_proposal_6-30-09_final.html |title=Letter, June 30, 2009, from ACU Executive Vice President Dennis Whitfield to Rick Rogers, FedEx |publisher=[[Politico]] |access-date=July 17, 2009}}</ref> The letter said the ACU's campaign could include "Producing [[op-ed]]s and articles written by ACU’s Chairman David Keene and/or other members of the ACU’s Board of Directors."<ref name="ACUtoFedEX"/>
