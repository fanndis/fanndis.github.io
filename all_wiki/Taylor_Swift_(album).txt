Swift promoted the album by performing as the opening act, for the tours by artists such as [[Rascal Flatts]], [[George Strait]], [[Brad Paisley]], [[Tim McGraw]] and [[Faith Hill]].

And I'm sure if I hadn't signed with [[Scott Borchetta]] [head of [[Big Machine Records]]], everybody would be afraid to put out a 17-year-old."<ref name="albuminfo" />}}

"A Place in This World" was described by Roger Holland of ''[[PopMatters]]'' as "pure [[Hilary Duff]] pop".<ref name="PopMatters"/> Swift considered "Cold as You" as her favorite song on the album lyrically, saying "the hook is 'I've never been anywhere cold as you.'

Sean Dooley of [[About.com]] writes, the "[[piano]]-driven song [...] perfectly captures the awkward teenage angst we all endure—or have endured—at one time or another."<ref name="topabout" />

==Recording==
While recording her [[demo album]], Swift worked with demo producer [[Nathan Chapman (record producer)|Nathan Chapman]], whom she met in a little shed behind a publishing company she was at.<ref name="albuminfo" /> Swift said, "I'd always go in there and play him some new songs, and the next week he would have this awesome track, on which he played every instrument, and it sounded like a record. We did this for a period of a year to two years before I got my record deal."<ref name="albuminfo" />

To record ''Taylor Swift'', she had to choose which [[album producer]] she would work with: "Then, all of a sudden, it was, 'OK, we're going to use this producer' or 'We're going to use that producer.'"<ref name="albuminfo" /> After experimenting with different producers, originating from Nashville, Swift chose Chapman because of the unique sound he put into songs.<ref name="albuminfo" /> Big Machine Records was skeptical about hiring Chapman because he had never done a studio album prior to ''Taylor Swift'', only demos.<ref name="albuminfo" /> Swift described the songs he produced as "the right chemistry hit[ting]" and therefore, Big Machine Records accepted Chapman producing some of the album's songs.<ref name="albuminfo" /> In the end, Chapman produced all but one of the tracks on ''Taylor Swift''.<ref name="albuminfo" /> Recording was executed during a four-month period before 2005 was over.<ref name="albuminfo" />

==Packaging and release==
''Taylor Swift'' was released on October 24, 2006 with eleven tracks.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000I5YCCO|title=Taylor Swift: Taylor Swift: Music|accessdate=August 1, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306003209/http://www.amazon.com/Taylor-Swift/dp/B000I5YCCO|archivedate=March 6, 2016|url-status=live|asin=B000I5YCCO}}</ref> Swift was highly involved in the album packaging, designing doodle graphics herself.
