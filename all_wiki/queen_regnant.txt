A '''queen regnant''' (plural: queens regnant) is a female [[monarch]], equivalent in rank and title to a [[king (title)|king]], who reigns in her own right over a [[Realm]] known as a "Queendom"; as opposed to a [[queen consort]], who is the wife of a reigning king; or a [[regent|queen regent]], who is the guardian of a child monarch and reigns temporarily in the child's stead, be it {{Lang|la|[[de jure]]}} in sharing power, or {{Lang|la|[[de facto]]}} in ruling alone. A '''princess regnant''' is a female monarch who reigns in her own right over an "[[Principality]]"; an '''empress regnant''' is a female monarch who reigns in her own right over an "[[Empire]]".

A queen regnant possesses and exercises sovereign powers, whereas a queen consort or queen regent shares her spouse's and/or child's rank and titles, but does not share the sovereignty of her spouse or child. The husband or child of a queen regnant traditionally does not share the queen regnant's rank, title or sovereignty. However, the concept of a [[king consort]] or [[prince consort]] is not unheard of in both contemporary and classical periods.

A [[queen dowager]] or [[empress dowager]] is the widow of a king or emperor; a [[queen mother]] is a queen dowager who is also the mother of a reigning sovereign.

[[File:Elizabeth II & Philip after Coronation.JPG|left|thumb|[[Elizabeth II]], Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, here with her husband on the occasion of her coronation in 1953]]

In Ancient Africa, [[Ancient Persia]], Asian and Pacific cultures, and in some European countries, female monarchs have been given the title ''king'' or its equivalent, such as ''[[pharaoh]]'', when gender is irrelevant to the office, or else have used the masculine form of the word in languages that have [[grammatical gender]] as a way to classify nouns. The [[Byzantine]] [[Empress Irene]] sometimes titled herself ''[[basileus]]'' (βασιλεύς), 'emperor', rather than ''basilissa'' (βασίλισσα), 'empress' and [[Jadwiga of Poland]] was crowned as ''Rex Poloniae'', ''King of Poland''.

Among the [[Davidic]] Monarchs of the [[Kingdom of Judah]], there is mentioned a single queen regnant, [[Athaliah]], though the [[Hebrew Bible]] regards her negatively as a usurper. The much later [[Hasmonean]] Queen [[Salome Alexandra]] (Shlom Tzion) was highly popular.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

Accession of a queen regnant occurs as a nation's [[order of succession]] permits. Methods of succession to queendoms, kingdoms, [[tribe|tribal]] chiefships, and such include nomination (the reigning monarch or a council names an heir), [[primogeniture]] (in which the children of a monarch or chief have preference in order of birth from eldest to youngest), and [[ultimogeniture]] (in which the children have preference in the reverse order of birth from youngest to eldest). The scope of succession may be matrilineal, patrilineal, or both; or, rarely, open to general election when necessary. The right of succession may be open to men and women, or limited to men only or to women only.

The most typical succession in European monarchies from the [[Late Middle Ages]] until the late 20th century was [[male-preference primogeniture]]: the order of succession ranked the sons of the monarch in order of their birth, followed by the daughters. Historically, many realms{{which|date=January 2014}} forbade succession by women or through a female line in accordance with the [[Salic law]], and some{{which|date=January 2014}} still do. No queen regnant ever ruled [[France]], for example. Only one woman, [[Maria Theresa of Austria|Maria Theresa]], ruled Austria. As noted in the list below of widely-known ruling queens, many reigned in European monarchies.

In the late 20th and early 21st centuries, [[Sweden]], [[Norway]], [[Belgium]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Denmark]], [[Luxembourg]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-15489544|title=Overturning centuries of royal rules|work=BBC News}}</ref> and the [[United Kingdom|UK]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-32073399|title=New rules on royal succession come into force|work=BBC News}}</ref> amended their laws of succession to [[absolute primogeniture]] (in which the children of a monarch or chief have preference in order of birth from eldest to youngest regardless of gender). In some cases, the change does not take effect during the lifetimes of people already in the line of succession at the time the law was passed.

In 2011, the United Kingdom and the 15 other [[Commonwealth realms]] agreed to remove the rule of male-preference primogeniture. Once [[Perth Agreement|the necessary legislation]] was passed, this means that had [[Prince William]] had a daughter first, a younger son would not have become heir apparent.<ref>{{cite news|last=Bloxham|first=Andy|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/theroyalfamily/8854981/Centuries-old-rule-of-succession-in-British-Royal-family-scrapped-by-Commonwealth.html|accessdate=2011-12-31|newspaper=Telegraph|location=London|title=Centuries-old rule of primogeniture in Royal Family scrapped|date=28 October 2011}}</ref>

In 2015, [[Elizabeth II]] became the [[List of longest-reigning monarchs|longest-reigning queen regnant]] and female head of state in world history. In 2016, she became the [[List of current state leaders by date of assumption of office|longest currently serving head of state]] and [[Current reigning monarchs by length of reign|longest currently reigning monarch]].

===East Asia===
In [[China]], [[Wu Zetian]] became the Chinese empress regnant and established the [[Zhou Dynasty (690–705)|Zhou Dynasty]] after dismissing her sons. The Empress Wu used the title ''huangdi'' (皇帝, "emperor") and in many European sources, is referred to as a female emperor rather than an empress regnant. A few decades earlier in Korea, [[Queen Seondeok of Silla]] and [[Jindeok of Silla]] developed the term ''yeowang'' (여왕, "female king") to refer to themselves, using the title instead of ''wangbi'' (왕비), which is usually translated as "queen consort" and refers to the wife of a king or emperor.

Although the [[Chrysanthemum Throne]] of [[Japan]] is currently barred to women, this has not always been the case; throughout Japanese history there have been eight empresses regnant. Again, the Japanese language uses the term ''josei tennō'' (女性天皇, "female imperial ruler") for the position which would be "empress regnant" in English, with ''kōgō'' (皇后) being the term reserved for an empress consort. The [[Japanese succession debate]] became a significant political issue during the early 2000s, as no male children had been born to the Imperial House of Japan since 1965. Prime Minister [[Junichirō Koizumi]] pledged to present parliament with a bill to allow women to ascend the Imperial Throne, but he withdrew this after the birth of [[Prince Hisahito of Akishino|Prince Hisahito]] in 2006.
