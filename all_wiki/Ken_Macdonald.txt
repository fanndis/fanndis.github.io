==Career==

=== Barrister ===
Macdonald was [[called to the Bar]] by the [[Inner Temple]] in July 1978 where he became the first [[pupillage|pupil]] of barrister [[Helena Kennedy]].<ref>{{cite web|year=2007|title=The Bar Directory: Kenneth John Douglas Macdonald|url=http://www.legalhub.co.uk/legalhub/app/document?rs=BOL1.0&vr=1.0&src=rl&srguid=ia744c062000001175e2a3b4acb95c05a&docguid=I67a3bca08bce11dcaa9aaaaa0e13eb96&hitguid=I67a3bca08bce11dcaa9aaaaa0e13eb96&spos=6&epos=6&td=41&bctocguid=Id6edd5a002c711db85b9d734e660a063&bchistory=5;&ststate=S;S;S&ctype=The%20Bar%20Directory&page=0&sibs=&toc-search=|accessdate=9 January 2008|work=The Legal Hub|publisher=Thomson Global Resources, data supplied by the [[Bar Council]]}}{{Dead link|date=September 2018|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes}}</ref><ref name="Guardian20040210" /> He was appointed a [[Queen's Counsel]] in 1997.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=54736|page=4476|date=15 April 1997}}</ref> As a junior barrister he defended a number of terrorist suspects (both [[Provisional IRA]] and those from the Middle East), fraudsters and major drug dealers. He was also on the defence team for the [[Matrix Churchill]] trial.<ref name="Guardian20040210" /> In the late 1990s, he was a co-founder of [[Matrix Chambers]] (a set of barristers' [[Chambers (law)|chambers]] specialising in human rights cases) with [[Cherie Booth]] and [[Tim Owen (barrister)|Tim Owen]].<ref name="Guardian20040210" /> In 2001 he became a [[recorder (judge)|recorder]] (a part-time judge) in the [[Crown Court]].<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=56414|page=14589|date=11 December 2001 }}</ref>

===Director of Public Prosecutions===
In August 2003 it was announced that Macdonald would succeed [[David Calvert-Smith]] as [[Director of Public Prosecutions (England and Wales)|Director of Public Prosecutions]] (DPP) in October of that year.<ref name=Telegraph20030805>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2003/08/06/ncher06.xml|title=Cherie's colleague is named as DPP

|first=Benedict|last=Brogan|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=5 August 2003|accessdate=30 July 2008 | location=London}}</ref> The appointment was immediately denounced by [[Opposition (parliamentary)|Opposition]] spokespeople as "rampant cronyism" and a "provocative appointment" due to Macdonald's business relationship with Cherie Booth (wife of then prime minister [[Tony Blair]]) and his lack of prosecution experience.<ref name=Telegraph20030805 /> Government officials, including both the [[Attorney General]] and [[Solicitor General for England and Wales|Solicitor General]] defended the appointment as it had been made by an independent board consisting of [[First Civil Service Commissioner]] [[Baroness Prashar|Usha Prashar]]; [[Hayden Phillips]], the [[Permanent Secretary]] at the [[Department for Constitutional Affairs]]; [[David Omand]], the Cabinet Office Permanent Secretary; and [[Robin Auld]], a [[Lord Justice of Appeal]].<ref name=Telegraph20030805 /><ref>{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/cgi-bin/newhtml_hl?DB=semukparl&STEMMER=en&WORDS=macdonald%20director%20of%20public%20prosecut&ALL=macdonald%20director%20of%20public%20prosecutions&ANY=&PHRASE=&CATEGORIES=&SIMPLE=&SPEAKER=&COLOUR=red&STYLE=s&ANCHOR=30917w13.html_wqn5&URL=/pa/cm200203/cmhansrd/vo030917/text/30917w13.htm#30917w13.html_wqn5|title=Hansard, Written answers, Director of Public Prosecutions|work=[[Hansard]]|publisher=[[Parliament of the United Kingdom]]|date=17 September 2003|accessdate=9 January 2008}}</ref> A few days after the announcement, the press uncovered details of his earlier conviction, sparking fresh controversy.<ref name=Guardian20040210 /><ref name=Telegraph20030811b>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/opinion/main.jhtml;jsessionid=ZBJO3LW4RLE41QFIQMFCFF4AVCBQYIV0?xml=/opinion/2003/08/14/dp1401.xml |title=New DPP had drugs conviction at Oxford |last=Spy |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=14 August 2003 |accessdate=9 January 2008 |location=London |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080107133538/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/opinion/main.jhtml |archive-date= 7 January 2008}}</ref> Fellow lawyer [[David Pannick]] wrote in ''[[The Times]]'' to defend Macdonald's appointment and attack the tabloid campaign against him.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/law/article1154073.ece |title=Why tabloids' silly campaign against the DPP is so wrong |first=David |last=Pannick |work=The Times |date=2 September 2003|accessdate=9 January 2008 |location=London}}</ref> Macdonald's predecessor also dismissed the relevance of the drugs offence and a report in ''[[The Independent]]'' also found support for his appointment from within the legal system.<ref>{{cite news|last=Verkaik|first=Robert|date=3 November 2003|title=Sir David Calvert-Smith: The butler, his evidence and a delicate issue of calling the Queen as a criminal case witness|work=[[The Independent]]|location=London|url=http://news.independent.co.uk/people/profiles/article76459.ece|url-status=dead|accessdate=9 January 2008|archive-url=https://archive.today/20131129021240/http://news.independent.co.uk/people/profiles/article76459.ece|archive-date=29 November 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/legal/article85149.ece |title=Public persecution |first=Robert |last=Verkaik |work=[[The Independent]] |date=2 September 2003 |accessdate=9 January 2008 |location=London }}{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

As DPP, Macdonald established the Counter Terrorism Division, the Organised Crime Division, the Special Crime Division and the Fraud Prosecution Service. In office, he often took positions which were critical of the government. For example, he opposed ministers' rhetoric around the "War on Terror", preferring to see terrorist attacks in the UK as law enforcement issues. He was prominent in criticising government attempts to extend pre-charge detention to 42 days, arguing that due process protections should not be undermined and that the reform was unnecessary. Near the end of his term, leaders in ''[[The Guardian]]'' and ''The Times'' strongly supported his record in office.<ref>{{cite news|last=Leader|date=25 January 2007|title=In praise of ...

We might end up living with something we cannot bear."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article4984788.ece|title=DPP chief Sir Ken Macdonald attacks Big Brother state surveillance |work=The Times |date=21 October 2008 |accessdate=22 October 2008 |location=London |first=Frances |last=Gibb}}</ref>

He was awarded a [[Knight Bachelor|knighthood]] in the 2007 [[New Year Honours]].<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=58196 |page=1 |supp=y|date=30 December 2006}}</ref><ref>{{London Gazette |issue=58424 |date=17 August 2007 |page=12003}}</ref>

===Later career===
Macdonald retired as DPP on 31 October 2008, returning to private practice at [[Matrix Chambers]] and becoming a regular contributor to ''The Times'', where he writes on law, security and politics.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/law/article4397189.ece |title=Human rights lawyer Keir Starmer named as new prosecution service chief |work=The Times |date=26 July 2008 |first=Frances |last=Gibb |accessdate=4 August 2008 |location=London}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://journalisted.com/ken-macdonald?allarticles=yes |title=Articles by Sir Ken Macdonald |work=Journalisted |publisher=[[Media Standards Trust]] |accessdate=18 August 2010}}</ref> He was succeeded in the office by [[Keir Starmer]]. In 2009, he was appointed a Visiting Professor of Law at the [[London School of Economics]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lse.ac.uk/collections/law/staff/staff-firstpage.htm|title=Staff|publisher=LSE Department of Law|accessdate=18 August 2010}}</ref> In 2010, he became a Deputy High Court Judge and a member of the Advisory Board of the Centre for Criminology at the [[University of Oxford]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.crim.ox.ac.uk/Governance/index.htm |title=Governance |publisher=Centre for Criminology—University of Oxford |accessdate=18 August 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101021063323/http://www.crim.ox.ac.uk/Governance/index.htm |archive-date=21 October 2010}}</ref>

On 14 December 2009, Macdonald wrote an article in ''[[The Times]]'' about the [[Chilcot Inquiry]] into the 2003 Iraq War.  This article was more critical than anything that has been said so far by any of the senior civil servants who worked in Whitehall when Blair was prime minister. It attracted media interest also because Macdonald is a member of [[Matrix Chambers]] as is [[Cherie Blair]]. Macdonald describes Blair's "sycophancy towards power" and wrote that "since those sorry days we have frequently heard [Blair] repeating the self-regarding mantra that 'hand on heart, I only did what I thought was right'. But this is a [[narcissist]]'s defence, and self-belief is no answer to misjudgment: it is certainly no answer to death."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/article6955241.ece|title=Intoxicated by power, Blair tricked us into war—The members of the Chilcot Inquiry have a choice: they can be loyal to the Establishment or they can expose the subterfuge |first=Ken |last=MacDonald |date=14 December 2009 |work=The Times |accessdate=3 February 2010 |location=London}}</ref>

On 28 May 2010, [[Downing Street]] announced that Macdonald would be made a Liberal Democrat [[life peer]] in the [[2010 Dissolution Honours List]],<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.number10.gov.uk/news/latest-news/2010/05/peerages-honours-and-appointments-51162|title=Peerages, honours and appointments|date=28 May 2010|work=Number10.gov.uk—The official site of the Prime Minister's Office|accessdate=11 June 2010}}</ref> which was [[London Gazette|gazetted]] on 15 June.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=59459 |supp=y|page=11151|date=15 June 2010}}</ref> The [[Letters Patent]] were gazetted on 15 July, dated 12 July granting him the title of '''Baron Macdonald of River Glaven''', ''of [[Cley-next-the-Sea]] in the [[County of Norfolk]]''.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=59489|page=13485|date=15 July 2010}}</ref> On 13 July 2010, [[Theresa May]], the [[Home Secretary]], announced to Parliament that she had invited Macdonald to oversee a government review of counter terrorism and security powers, to ensure that legislative measures in place were proportionate and consistent with the rule of law.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/media-centre/press-releases/counter-powers|title=Rapid review of counter-terrorism powers|publisher=[[Home Office]]|date=13 July 2010|accessdate=18 August 2010}}</ref> In October 2010, as part of Turkey's accession negotiations to the European Union, and on the recommendation of the [[Council of Europe]], the [[European Commission]] invited Macdonald to lead an EU mission to Turkey to assess that country's commitment to free expression and a free press.<ref name="matrixlaw">{{Cite web|url=https://www.matrixlaw.co.uk/news-events/|title=News|website=Matrix Chambers}}</ref>

In January 2011, it was announced that Macdonald was to succeed the late [[Lord Bingham of Cornhill]] as the chair of [[Reprieve (organisation)|Reprieve]], the leading international anti-death penalty and prisoners' rights organisation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://reprieve.org.uk/press/2011_01_11kenmacdonaldchair/|title=Ken Macdonald QC to become Reprieve's new Chair}}</ref> In April 2011, he joined the Council of the Institute of Contemporary Arts, London.<ref name="matrixlaw" /> In November 2011, he was elected an honorary fellow of St Edmund Hall, Oxford<ref name="matrixlaw" /> and in September 2012, he became Warden of [[Wadham College, Oxford]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wadham.ox.ac.uk/friends-alumni/news/news.html |title=News |work=wadham.ox.ac.uk |year=2011 |accessdate=1 June 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110906090503/http://www.wadham.ox.ac.uk/friends-alumni/news/news.html |archive-date= 6 September 2011}}</ref> In 2015, he became Chair of [[The Orwell Foundation]] which awards the [[Orwell Prize]] for journalism and political writing. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.orwellfoundation.com/the-orwell-foundation/news-events/news-events/news/ken-macdonald-qc-becomes-new-chair-of-the-orwell-prize/|title=Ken Macdonald QC becomes new Chair of the Orwell Prize|website=The Orwell Foundation}}</ref> Macdonald publicly criticised the [[Counter-Terrorism and Security Act 2015]] in February 2016, saying it was a threat to freedom of academic expression and research.<ref>{{Cite news|title = Anti-terror laws risk 'chilling effect' on academic debate – Oxford college head|url = https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/feb/07/anti-terror-laws-academic-debate-oxford-college-ken-macdonald-prevent-strategy-university|newspaper = theguardian.com|date = 7 February 2016|access-date = 8 February 2016|first = Richard|last = Adams}}</ref> In 2020, he became President of the [[Howard League for Penal Reform]]. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://howardleague.org/news/howard-league-announces-new-president/|title=The Howard League &#124; Howard League announces new President|website=The Howard League}}</ref>

In October 2020, he said that the [[Covert Human Intelligence Sources (Criminal Conduct) Bill]] had "gone too far" in protecting Government authorities from prosecution: he called for explicit limits on the crimes covered by the bill, so that it would not permit murder, torture or sexual violence.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/call-to-rein-in-law-that-lets-mi5-informants-commit-crimes-7pm7j8jgn|title=Call to rein in law that lets MI5 informants commit crimes|last=Hamilton|first=Fiona|work=The Times|date=5 October 2020|access-date=6 October 2020}}</ref>
