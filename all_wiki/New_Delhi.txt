New Delhi is also the seat of all three branches of the [[government of India]], hosting the [[Rashtrapati Bhavan]], [[Parliament House (India)|Parliament House]], and the [[Supreme Court of India]].

Although colloquially ''Delhi'' and ''New Delhi'' are used interchangeably to refer to the [[National Capital Territory of Delhi]] (NCT), these are two distinct entities, with New Delhi forming a small part of the city of Delhi. The [[National Capital Region (India)|National Capital Region]] is a much larger entity comprising the entire [[National Capital Territory of Delhi|NCT]] along with adjoining districts in neighbouring states.

[[Calcutta]] (now Kolkata) was the capital of India during the British Raj, until December 1911. Calcutta had become the centre of the nationalist movements since the late nineteenth century, which led to the [[Partition of Bengal (1905)|Partition of Bengal]] by then Viceroy of British India, [[Lord Curzon]]. This created massive political and religious upsurge including political assassinations of British officials in Calcutta. The anti-colonial sentiments amongst the public led to complete boycott of British goods, which forced the colonial government to reunite Bengal and immediately shift the capital to New Delhi.<ref name="Move From Calcutta">{{cite news|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/86-years-ago-new-delhi-took-over-as-power-capital-of-india/articleshow/57133366.cms|title=86 years ago New Delhi took over as power capital of India|work=Times of India}}</ref>

[[Old Delhi]] had served as the political and financial centre of several empires of [[History of India|ancient India]] and the [[Delhi Sultanate]], most notably of the [[Mughal Empire]] from 1649 to 1857. During the early 1900s, a proposal was made to the British administration to shift the capital of the British Indian Empire, as India was officially named, from Calcutta on the east coast, to Delhi.<ref name="Delhi Move">{{cite news|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/indiarealtime/2011/11/11/why-delhi-the-move-from-calcutta/|title=Why Delhi?

Soon Lutyens started considering other places. Indeed, the Delhi Town Planning Committee, set up to plan the new imperial capital, with [[George Swinton]] as chairman, and John A. Brodie and [[Lutyens]] as members, submitted reports for both north and south sites. However, it was rejected by the Viceroy when the cost of acquiring the necessary properties was found to be too high. The central axis of New Delhi, which today faces east at [[India Gate]], was previously meant to be a north–south axis linking the [[Viceroy's House]] at one end with [[Paharganj]] at the other. Eventually, owing to space constraints and the presence of a large number of heritage sites in the north side, the committee settled on the south site.<ref>Chishti, p. 225.</ref> A site atop the [[Raisina Hill]], formerly Raisina Village, a [[Meo (ethnic group)|Meo]] village, was chosen for the [[Rashtrapati Bhawan]], then known as the Viceroy's House. The reason for this choice was that the hill lay directly opposite the [[Purana Qila|Dinapanah]] citadel, which was also considered the site of [[Indraprastha]], the ancient region of Delhi. Subsequently, the foundation stone was shifted from the site of [[Delhi Durbar]] of 1911–1912, where the Coronation Pillar stood, and embedded in the walls of the forecourt of [[Secretariat Building, New Delhi|the Secretariat]]. The [[Rajpath]], also known as King's Way, stretched from the [[India Gate]] to the Rashtrapati Bhawan. The Secretariat building, the two blocks of which flank the Rashtrapati Bhawan and houses ministries of the government of India, and the [[Parliament of India|Parliament House]], both designed by Baker, are located at the [[Sansad Marg]] and run parallel to the Rajpath.

In the south, land up to [[Safdarjung's Tomb]] was acquired to create what is today known as [[Lutyens' Bungalow Zone]].<ref>Chishti, p. 222.</ref> Before construction could begin on the rocky ridge of Raisina Hill, a circular railway line around the Council House (now [[Parliament of India|Parliament House]]), called the ''Imperial Delhi Railway'', was built to transport construction material and workers for the next twenty years. The last stumbling block was the [[Agra]]-Delhi railway line that cut right through the site earmarked for the hexagonal All-India War Memorial ([[India Gate]]) and Kingsway ([[Rajpath]]), which was a problem because the [[Old Delhi Railway Station]] served the entire city at that time. The line was shifted to run along the [[Yamuna river]], and it began operating in 1924. The [[New Delhi Railway Station]] opened in 1926, with a single platform at [[Ajmeri Gate]] near [[Paharganj]], and was completed in time for the city's inauguration in 1931.<ref name=htlux>{{cite news|title=A fine balance of luxury and care |url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/News-Feed/chunk-ht-ui-newdelhi100years-topstories/A-fine-balance-of-luxury-and-care/Article1-723880.aspx |work=Hindustan Times |date=21 July 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141214175839/http://www.hindustantimes.com/news-feed/chunk-ht-ui-newdelhi100years-topstories/a-fine-balance-of-luxury-and-care/article1-723880.aspx |archivedate=14 December 2014 }}</ref><ref name=hindustantimes652023>{{cite news|title=When Railways nearly derailed New Delhi |url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/News-Feed/newdelhi/When-Railways-nearly-derailed-New-Delhi/Article1-652023.aspx |work=Hindustan Times |date=18 January 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130926091104/http://www.hindustantimes.com/News-Feed/newdelhi/When-Railways-nearly-derailed-New-Delhi/Article1-652023.aspx |archivedate=26 September 2013 }}</ref> As construction of the Viceroy's House (the present Rashtrapati Bhavan), [[Secretariat Building, New Delhi|Central Secretariat]], [[Sansad Bhavan|Parliament House]], and All-India War Memorial ([[India Gate]]) was winding down, the building of a shopping district and a new plaza, [[Connaught Place, New Delhi|Connaught Place]], began in 1929, and was completed by 1933.

After the capital of India moved to Delhi, a temporary secretariat building was constructed in a few months in 1912 in [[North Delhi]]. Most of the government offices of the new capital moved here from the 'Old secretariat' in [[Old Delhi]] (the building now houses the [[Delhi Legislative Assembly]]), a decade before the new capital was inaugurated in 1931. Many employees were brought into the new capital from distant parts of India, including the [[Bengal Presidency]] and [[Madras Presidency]].

After India gained [[Independence Day (India)|independence]] in 1947, limited autonomy was conferred to New Delhi and was administered by a Chief Commissioner appointed by the [[Government of India]]. In 1966, Delhi was converted into a [[union territory]] and eventually the Chief Commissioner was replaced by a Lieutenant Governor. The [[Constitution of India|Constitution (Sixty-ninth Amendment) Act, 1991]] declared the Union Territory of Delhi to be formally known as National Capital Territory of Delhi.<ref name=NCTact>{{cite web

With a total area of {{convert|42.7|sqkm|sqmi|abbr=on}}<ref name='Delhi Info'/>, New Delhi forms a small part of the Delhi metropolitan area.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ndmc.gov.in/AboutNDMC/NNDMCAct.aspx |title=NDMC Act |publisher=Ndmc.gov.in |accessdate=4 November 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080302220220/http://www.ndmc.gov.in/AboutNDMC/NNDMCAct.aspx |archivedate= 2 March 2008 }}</ref> Since the city is located on the [[Indo-Gangetic Plain]], there is little difference in elevation across the city. New Delhi and surrounding areas were once a part of the [[Aravalli Range|Aravali Range]]; all that is left of those mountains is the [[Delhi Ridge]], which is also called the Lungs of Delhi. While New Delhi lies on the floodplains of the [[Yamuna River]], it is essentially a landlocked city. East of the river is the urban area of [[Shahdara]]. New Delhi falls under the [[Earthquake hazard zoning of India|seismic zone-IV]], making it vulnerable to earthquakes.<ref name=hazardprofile>{{cite web|url=http://www.undp.org.in/dmweb/hazardprofile.pdf|title=Hazard profiles of Indian districts|accessdate=23 August 2006|work=National Capacity Building Project in Disaster Management|publisher=[[UNDP]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060519100611/http://www.undp.org.in/dmweb/hazardprofile.pdf|archivedate=19 May 2006 }}</ref>

===Seismology===
New Delhi lies on several fault lines and thus experiences frequent earthquakes, most of them of mild intensity. There was a spike in the number of earthquakes between 2011 and 2015, most notable being a 5.4 magnitude earthquake in 2015 with its epicentre in Nepal, a 4.7-magnitude earthquake on 25 November 2007, a 4.2-magnitude earthquake on 7 September 2011, a 5.2-magnitude earthquake on 5 March 2012, and a swarm of twelve earthquakes, including four of magnitudes 2.5, 2.8, 3.1, and 3.3, on 12 November 2013.

===Climate===
<!-- The section should provide data only from the New Delhi area under NDMC. Not of the entire NCT. -->
{{See also|Climate of Delhi}}
The climate of New Delhi is a [[hot semi-arid climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''BSh'') bordering on a dry-winter [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Cwa'') with high variation between summer and winter in terms of both temperature and rainfall. The temperature varies from {{convert|46|°C}} in summers to around {{convert|0|°C}} in winters. The area's version of a humid subtropical climate is noticeably different from many other cities with this climate classification in that it features long and very hot summers with [[dust storm]]s, relatively dry and mild winters with [[wildfire]] [[haze]], and a [[monsoon]]al period. Summers are long, extending from early April to October, with the monsoon season occurring in the middle of the summer. Winter starts in November and peaks in January. The annual mean temperature is around {{convert|25|°C}}; monthly daily mean temperatures range from approximately {{convert|14|to|34|°C|°F|0}}. New Delhi's highest temperature ever recorded is {{convert|48.4|°C}} on 26 May 1998 while the lowest temperature ever recorded is {{convert|-2.2|°C}} on 11 January 1967, both of which are recorded at Indira Gandhi International Airport (formerly known as [[Palam Airport]]).<ref name=IMD2>{{cite web

In an attempt to lessen [[air pollution]] in New Delhi, which gets worse during the winter, a temporary [[alternate-day travel]] scheme for cars using the odd- and even-numbered licence plates system was announced by [[Delhi]] government in December 2015. In addition, trucks were to be allowed to enter India's capital only after 11&nbsp;pm, two hours later than the existing restriction.<ref name=Delhi122015>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/05/world/asia/delhi-announces-pollution-control-measures.html|title=Delhi to Limit Use of Cars in an Effort to Control Pollution |author=Nida Najar |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=4 December 2015|accessdate=5 December 2015}}</ref> The driving restriction scheme was planned to be implemented as a trial from 1 January 2016 for an initial period of 15 days.

On 16 December 2015, the [[Supreme Court of India]] mandated several restrictions on Delhi's transportation system to curb pollution. Among the measures, the court ordered to stop registrations of diesel cars and sport utility vehicles with an engine capacity of 2,000 cc and over until 31 March 2016. The court also ordered all taxis in the Delhi region to switch to [[compressed natural gas]] by 1 March 2016. Transportation vehicles that are more than 10 years old were banned from entering the capital.<ref name=20151217nytimes>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/17/world/asia/india-choking-on-pollution-restricts-vehicle-use-in-new-delhi.html|title=India, choking on pollution, Restricts Vehicle Use in Delhi |author=Nida Najar |work=[[The New York Times]]|date=16 December 2015|accessdate=19 December 2015}}</ref>

Analysing real-time vehicle speed data from Uber Delhi revealed that during the odd-even program, average speeds went up by a statistically significant 5.4 per cent (2.8 standard deviation from normal). This means vehicles have lesser idling time in traffic and vehicle engines would run closer to minimum fuel consumption.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/odd-even-policy-delhi-pollution-yes-delhi-it-worked/|title=Yes, Delhi, it worked|date=19 January 2016|publisher=}}</ref> "In bordering areas, PM 2.5 levels were recorded more than 400 (ug/m3) while in inner areas in Delhi, they were recorded between 150 and 210 on an average."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/Odd-even-scheme-likely-to-return-in-Delhi-after-March-schools-2nd-car-among-concerns/articleshow/50629135.cms|title=Odd-even scheme likely to return in Delhi after March; schools, 2nd car among concerns – Times of India|publisher=}}</ref> However, the subcity of Dwarka, located in the southwest district, has a substantially low level of air pollution.

{{Main|Delhi Metro}}
The [[Delhi Metro]] is a rapid transit system serving Delhi, [[Faridabad]], [[Ghaziabad]], [[Gurgaon]] and [[Noida]] in the National Capital Region of India. Delhi Metro is the world's 12th largest metro system in terms of length. Delhi Metro was India's first modern public transportation system, which had revolutionised travel by providing a fast, reliable, safe, and comfortable means of transport. Presently, the Delhi Metro network consists of {{convert|389|km|mile|abbr=off}} of track, with 285 stations.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Delhi Metro Rail Corporation Ltd. {{!}} ABOUT US|url=http://www.delhimetrorail.com/about_us.aspx|access-date=17 July 2020|website=www.delhimetrorail.com}}</ref> The network has now crossed the boundaries of Delhi to reach Ghaziabad and Noida in Uttar Pradesh, and Faridabad and Gurgaon in Haryana. All stations have escalators, elevators, and tactile tiles to guide the visually impaired from station entrances to trains. It has a combination of elevated, at-grade, and underground lines, and uses both broad gauge and standard gauge rolling stock. Four types of rolling stock are used: Mitsubishi-ROTEM Broad gauge, Bombardier MOVIA, Mitsubishi-ROTEM Standard gauge, and CAF Beasain Standard gauge. According to a study, Delhi Metro has helped in removing about 390,000 vehicles from the streets of Delhi.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Delhi Metro helps keep 3.9 lakh vehicles off roads in 2014 - The Economic Times|work=The Economic Times|url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/transportation/railways/delhi-metro-helps-keep-3-9-lakh-vehicles-off-roads-in-2014/articleshow/45717584.cms?from=mdr|access-date=17 July 2020}}</ref>

Delhi Metro is being built and operated by the [[Delhi Metro Rail Corporation Limited]] (DMRC), a state-owned company with equal equity participation from Government of India and Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi. However, the organisation is under administrative control of Ministry of Urban Development, Government of India. Besides construction and operation of Delhi metro, DMRC is also involved in the planning and implementation of metro rail, monorail and high-speed rail projects in India and providing consultancy services to other metro projects in the country as well as abroad. The Delhi Metro project was spearheaded by [[Padma Vibhushan]] [[E. Sreedharan]], the managing director of DMRC and popularly known as the "Metro Man" of India. He famously resigned<ref>{{Cite web|title=E Sreedharan resigns as Delhi Metro chief|url=https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/e-sreedharan-resigns-as-delhi-metro-chief-397775|access-date=17 July 2020|website=NDTV.com}}</ref> from DMRC, taking moral responsibility for a metro bridge collapse<ref>{{Cite news|last=India|first=Press Trust of|date=12 July 2009|title=Under-construction Delhi Metro bridge collapses, 5 killed|work=Business Standard India|url=https://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/under-construction-delhi-metro-bridge-collapses-5-killed-109071200064_1.html|access-date=17 July 2020}}</ref> which took five lives. Sreedharan was awarded with the prestigious [[Legion of Honour]] by the French government for his contribution to Delhi Metro.

[[File:Rashtrapati Bhavan (Dehli).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Rashtrapati Bhavan]] is the official residence of the [[President of India]].]]
Much of New Delhi, planned by the leading 20th-century British architect [[Edwin Lutyens]], was laid out to be the central administrative area of the city as a testament to Britain's imperial ambitions. New Delhi is structured around two central [[promenade]]s called the [[Rajpath]] and the [[Janpath]]. The Rajpath, or King's Way, stretches from the [[Rashtrapati Bhavan]] to the [[India Gate]]. The [[Janpath]] (Hindi: "Path of the People"), formerly Queen's Way, begins at [[Connaught Circus]] and cuts the Rajpath at right angles. 19 foreign embassies are located on the nearby Shantipath (Hindi: "Path of Peace"), making it the largest diplomatic enclave in India.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.delhionline.in/City-Guide/Embassies-in-Delhi/ |title=Embassies in Delhi, Embassies Address, Contacts, E-Mail, Delhi Embassies |publisher=Delhionline.in |accessdate=4 November 2008}}</ref>

At the heart of the city is the magnificent Rashtrapati Bhavan (formerly known as Viceroy's House) which sits atop [[Raisina Hill]]. The Secretariat, which houses ministries of the government of India, flanks out of the Rashtrapati Bhavan. The Parliament House, designed by Herbert Baker, is located at the Sansad Marg, which runs parallel to the Rajpath. [[Connaught Place, New Delhi|Connaught Place]] is a large, circular commercial area in New Delhi, modelled after the [[Royal Crescent]] in England. Twelve separate roads lead out of the outer ring of Connaught Place, one of them being the Janpath.

===Architecture===
The New Delhi town plan, like its architecture, was chosen with one single chief consideration: to be a symbol of British power and supremacy.<ref name="Architecture New Delhi"/><ref name="Millennium New Delhi">{{cite book|title=The Millennium Book on New Delhi| publisher=Oxford University Press, USA| isbn=978-0-19-565445-5| year=2001}}</ref><ref name="New Delhi birth controversy">{{cite web|url=http://www.ndtv.com/article/india/new-delhi-s-controversial-birth-157374|title=New Delhi's controversial birth|publisher=[[NDTV]]|accessdate=10 March 2012}}</ref> All other decisions were subordinate to this, and it was this framework that dictated the choice and application of symbology and influences from both Hindu and Islamic architecture.<ref name="New Delhi, New Capital">{{cite web|url=http://www.boloji.com/index.cfm?md=Content&sd=Articles&ArticleID=1005|title=New Delhi: A New Capital|publisher=Boloji.com|date=30 January 2012|access-date=29 January 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107032427/http://www.boloji.com/index.cfm?md=Content&sd=Articles&ArticleID=1005|archive-date=7 November 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name="Millennium New Delhi"/>

The fact that there were any indigenous features in the design were due to the persistence and urging of both the Viceroy [[Charles Hardinge, 1st Baron Hardinge of Penshurst|Lord Hardinge]] and historians like [[Ernest Binfield Havell|E.B.
