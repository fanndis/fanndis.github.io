The '''Log Cabin Republicans''' ('''LCR''') is an organization that works within the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] to advocate equal rights for [[LGBT in the United States|LGBT Americans]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Log Cabin Republicans {{!}} About Us|url=http://www.logcabin.org/about-us/|access-date=2020-08-30|website=Log Cabin Republicans|language=en}}</ref>

==History==
Log Cabin Republicans was founded in 1977 in California as a rallying point for Republicans opposed to the [[Briggs Initiative]], which attempted to ban homosexuals from teaching in public schools. In addition to sanctioning the termination of openly gay and lesbian teachers, the proposed legislation authorized the firing of those teachers that supported homosexuality.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://spectator.org/articles/42050/reagan-and-milk |title=Reagan and Milk |publisher=The American Spectator |date=2009-02-26 |access-date=2014-10-22}}</ref>

While mounting his imminent presidential campaign, Ronald Reagan publicly expressed his opposition to the discriminatory policy. Reagan's condemnation of the bill—epitomized in a letter sent to a pro-Briggs group, excerpts of which were re-printed in the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' in 1978—played an influential role in the eventual defeat of the Briggs Initiative.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.reaganclubs.us/OurHero/ |title=Our Hero |publisher=The Ronald Reagan Assemblies of Florida |access-date=2013-07-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130508163632/http://www.reaganclubs.us/OurHero/ |archive-date=2013-05-08 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

In the midst of this victory, gay conservatives in California created the Log Cabin Republicans. The group initially proposed to name themselves Lincoln Club, but found that name was already in use by the Lincoln Club of Orange County, another California Republican organization, so the name Log Cabin Republicans was chosen as an alternative title. This designation calls attention to the first Republican president, Abraham Lincoln. The Log Cabin Republicans suggest that Lincoln founded the Republican Party on the philosophies of liberty and equality.  These principles, Log Cabin argues, are consistent with their platform of an inclusive Republican Party.<ref name="history">{{cite web|url=http://www.logcabin.org/about-us/our-history/ |title=Our History |publisher=Log Cabin Republicans |access-date=2013-07-30}}</ref>

===1992 presidential election===
The 1992 Log Cabin Republican convention was held in [[Spring, Texas]], a [[Houston, Texas|Houston]] exurb.  The main point of discussion was whether or not LCR would endorse the re-election of President [[George H. W. Bush]]. The group voted to deny that endorsement because Bush did not denounce anti-gay rhetoric at the [[1992 Republican National Convention]].<ref name="trib">{{cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2004-04-19/news/0404190183_1_amendment-banning-same-sex-marriage-log-cabin-republicans-gop-national-convention |title=Gays long loyal to GOP agonize over supporting Bush |date=April 19, 2004 |first=Lisa |last=Anderson |work=[[Chicago Tribune]]}}</ref>

===1996 presidential election===
In August 1995, the campaign of Republican presidential candidate, [[Bob Dole]], returned the LCR's $1,000 campaign contribution.<ref>Barron, C. 2004. A Big Question For Republicans, Gay & Lesbian Review Worldwide Vol. 11. P.27-29</ref> The campaign returned the contribution after openly lesbian columnist, Deb Price, of the ''Detroit News'', asked about it after she saw it on a public report from the [[Federal Elections Commission]].  The campaign sent a written statement to Price saying that Dole was in "100% disagreement with the agenda of the Log Cabin Republicans."<ref name="tafelbk">Tafel, p. 167–168.</ref> The finance office of the campaign had solicited the contribution from LCR. At the event where it was given, Dole had personally spoken with LCR's then-executive director, Rich Tafel, about the group and about AIDS legislation it was promoting in the Senate. Weeks earlier, Dole agreed to co-sponsor the legislation after a meeting with Tafel at the campaign's headquarters.<ref>Tafel, p.164–166</ref>  It resulted in a front-page story in ''[[The New York Times]]'', penned by Richard L. Berke, then-chief political reporter for the daily.<ref>Woodward,  p. 251.</ref>

As reporters, including Berke, were seeking confirmation of the story before it broke, Dole's finance chairman, John Moran, asked Tafel not to speak to the press and that Tafel's "steadfastness and statesmanship at this moment will be handsomely appreciated in the long run by the campaign."  Tafel refused.<ref>Tafel, p. 168.</ref>

Pundits accused Dole of being a "flip-flopper and a hypocrite."<ref name="frrch">[https://archive.today/20130111075008/http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F6061EFF3C5F0C728EDDA90994DD494D81&n=Top/Opinion/Editorials+and+Op-Ed/Op-Ed/Columnists/Frank+Rich Rich, Frank "The Log Cabin Lesson"]. New York Times, October 21, 1995. Retrieved January 29, 2007.</ref>  Editorials ran in major newspapers, including ''The Washington Post'', ''The New York Times'', the ''Boston Globe'', the ''Atlanta Journal-Constitution'', and the ''Times'' of London, condemning Dole's action, joined by radio commentators [[Rush Limbaugh]] and [[Don Imus]].<ref>Tafel, p. 169–170.</ref><ref name="wwdd">Woodward, p. 251.</ref>  Under the pressure, Dole admitted during an October 1995 press briefing on Capitol Hill that he regretted the decision to return the check, and that his campaign was responsible for it without consulting him.<ref>Tafel, p. 171.</ref>  "I think if they'd have consulted me, we wouldn't have done that, wouldn't have returned it," Dole said.<ref>Woodward, p. 284.</ref> Dole later told ''Washington Post'' editor and author [[Bob Woodward]] that the LCR episode was a "mistake" because the decision to return the check "gets into Bob Dole the person.  It's not so much about Bob Dole the candidate. It's the person.  Is he tolerant?  Does he tolerate different views?  Tolerate someone with a different lifestyle?"  He added, "This is basic, this is what people ought to know about you.  Are you going to just do this because it sounds good politically?"<ref>Woodward, p. 286.</ref>

LCR's leadership met with Dole's coalitions manager to discuss an endorsement after Dole's reversal.<ref>Tafel, p. 172.</ref>  Among various items, Tafel demanded there be no gay bashing in the speeches from the podium of the [[1996 Republican National Convention]], nor any anti-homosexual signs on the convention floor.  He also wanted to see a gay person address the convention and a public request from Dole's campaign for the LCR nod.<ref>Tafel, p. 173</ref> On the closing night of the Convention, Stephen Fong, then-president of the San Francisco chapter, spoke at the dais as part of a series of speeches from "mainstreet Americans," but was not publicly identified as gay.<ref name="tafel-174">Tafel, p. 174.</ref> Nevertheless, his presence on the podium for the organization and for the gay and lesbian community "was something that would have been unimaginable four years earlier," Tafel later wrote.<ref name="tafel-174"/> Fong was the first openly gay speaker at a Republican National Convention.<ref>{{cite web|last=Keen |first=Lisa |url=http://www.ebar.com/news/article.php?sec=news&article=71747 |title=The Bay Area Reporter Online &#124; Tension between gays and GOP shrouds convention |publisher=Ebar.com |date=2016-07-21 |access-date=2016-07-26}}</ref>

Two days later, Dole spokesperson Christina Martin told a reporter that the campaign "welcomed the endorsement of the Log Cabin Republicans."<ref name="tafel-174"/>  LCR voted to endorse Dole for President, and then-[[Republican National Committee]] chairman [[Haley Barbour]] approved the use of the RNC's press briefing room for Tafel, LCR's convention delegates and officers of its national board to announce their decision.<ref name="tafel-174"/>

Later in the campaign, Tafel met with Dole's chief aide Sheila Burke, and the remaining demands LCR made for their endorsement were met.  In a statement released by LCR, and confirmed to reporters by the campaign, Dole had pledged to maintain an executive order prohibiting discrimination based on sexual orientation in the federal workforce and full funding for AIDS programs.<ref name="tafel-174"/>

===2008 presidential election===
In September 2008, LCR voted to endorse the [[John McCain]]–[[Sarah Palin]] ticket in the [[2008 United States presidential election|2008 presidential election]].

===2012 presidential election===
On 23 October 2012, LCR officially endorsed [[Mitt Romney]] despite Mr. Romney's commitment to a constitutional amendment barring gays and lesbians from marriage nationwide and his objection to the repeal of the "[[Don't Ask, Don't Tell]]" policy on military service.<ref>{{cite web |title=With Endorsement, Log Cabin Republicans Declare 'We Are Americans First' |url=http://www.logcabin.org/pressrelease/with-endorsement-log-cabin-republicans-declare-we-are-americans-first/

===2020 presidential endorsement===

In November 2018, Jerri Ann Henry became the first woman to serve as Log Cabin executive director. A month later, she said in a television interview that, while she perceived Trump as having been "vocally supportive" of LGBT people compared to other Republican presidents and presidential candidates, nevertheless there had been "a lot of ups and downs in the last two years with some of the administration's actions."<ref name="thehill1">{{cite news|last1=Manchester|first1=Julia|date=7 December 2018|title=There are 'ups and downs' in Trump's relationship with LGBT community, says leader of gay GOP group|publisher=The Hill|url=https://thehill.com/hilltv/rising/420222-there-are-ups-and-downs-in-trumps-relationship-with-lgbt-community-says-leader|access-date=9 December 2018}}</ref>

==''Log Cabin Republicans v. United States''==
{{Main|Log Cabin Republicans v. United States}}
A lawsuit filed by LCR in federal court challenging the "[[Don't ask, don't tell|Don't Ask, Don't Tell]]" (DADT) policy, which excludes homosexuals from openly serving in the U. S. military, went to trial on July 13, 2010, presided by Judge [[Virginia Phillips]]. LCR argued that the policy violates the rights of homosexual military members to free speech, due process and open association.<ref>{{cite news|last=Watson|first=Julie|title=Log Cabin Republicans Challenge DADT|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/07/13/log-cabin-republicans-cha_n_644051.html|newspaper=Huffington Post|date=July 13, 2010}}</ref> The government argued that DADT was necessary to advance a legitimate governmental interest.<ref>Law.com: [http://www.law.com/jsp/article.jsp?id=1202463512493&Trial_Opens_in_Challenge_to_Dont_Ask_Dont_Tell Constitutional Challenge to 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell' Reaches Trial]</ref> LCR introduced several admissions by President [[Barack Obama]], including that DADT "doesn't contribute to our national security," "weakens our national security," and that reversing DADT is "essential for our national security". Rather than address plaintiff's claims or bring evidence to support their own claims of national interest, the government relied exclusively on the policy's 1993 legislative history.<ref>{{cite web|last=Woods |first=Daniel |title=Closing arguments, Log Cabin Republicans v.

LCR acts under the statement: "We are loyal Republicans. We believe in [[limited government]], strong [[national security|national defense]], [[free markets]], low taxes, personal responsibility, and [[individual liberty]]. Log Cabin Republicans represents an important part of the American family—taxpaying, hard working people who proudly believe in this nation's greatness. We also believe all Americans have the right to liberty and equality. We believe equality for LGBT Americans is in the finest tradition of the Republican Party. We educate our Party about why inclusion wins.

On social issues, LCR either dissents from [[socially conservative]] Republican views or is neutral.

On the issue of national defense: "Log Cabin Republicans believe in a confident foreign policy and a strong national defense.  As the world's sole military superpower, it is vital that the United States remain ready and able to shoulder its responsibilities in the global arena while standing as a beacon of freedom.

==Criticism==
LCR has been criticized for failing to promote Republican principles. Focusing on "the battle for gay and lesbian civil rights" at its March–April 2005 convention and Liberty Education Forum National Symposium, panel topics included "Corporate Diversity"; "Family Fairness"; and "Is Sexual Orientation a Choice?"  This caused two ''[[Washington Post]]'' opinion columnists to observe that "the Log Cabin Republicans are looking less and less Republican."<ref name="wapo"/>

In 2012, the Log Cabin Republicans were criticized by advocates of gay rights and marriage equality for endorsing Republican candidates who advocated new limitations on the legal rights of gay Americans as well as the retention of current discriminatory laws and policies.<ref>{{cite news|url = http://www.advocate.com/politics/marriage-equality/2012/10/21/romney-still-supports-federal-marriage-amendment|title = Romney Still Supports Federal Marriage Amendment|author = Michelle Garcia|date = October 21, 2012|newspaper = [[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]]|access-date = February 28, 2018}}</ref>

Some in the LGBT community have expressed dissatisfaction with the LCR, viewing it as a [[centrist]] organization that does not represent LGBT conservatives. In 2009, two former LCR members, [[Christopher R. Barron]] and [[Jimmy LaSalvia]], formed [[GOProud]] to represent LGBT conservatives and libertarians;<ref>{{cite news|url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB123966833747115385|newspaper = [[The Wall Street Journal]]|title = Gay, Proud and Conservative|first = William|last = McGurn|date = April 14, 2009|access-date = February 28, 2018}}</ref> it was dissolved in 2014.<ref>{{cite news|first = Tim|last = Mak|url = http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/06/06/inside-the-implosion-of-goproud-the-right-s-most-notorious-pro-gay-group.html|title = Inside the Implosion of GOProud, the Right’s Most Notorious Pro-Gay Group|newspaper = [[The Daily Beast]]|date = June 6, 2014|access-date = February 28, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url = http://bilerico.lgbtqnation.com/2014/06/goproud_denies_then_admits_it_is_closing_down.php|first = Bil|last = Browning|title = GOProud Denies, Then Admits It Is Closing Down|publisher = The Bilerico Project|date = June 2, 2014|access-date = February 28, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|first = David|last = Badash|newspaper = [[The New Civil Rights Movement]]|url = http://thenewcivilrightsmovement.com/gay-tea-party-group-goproud-definitely-shutting-down-director-admits-he-lied/news/2014/06/02/88447|title = Gay Tea Party Group GOProud Definitely Shutting Down – Director Admits He Lied|publisher = [[JM Media Holdings]]|date = June 2, 2014|access-date = February 28, 2018|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160909062842/http://www.thenewcivilrightsmovement.com/gay-tea-party-group-goproud-definitely-shutting-down-director-admits-he-lied/news/2014/06/02/88447|archive-date = 2016-09-09|url-status = dead}}</ref>

LCR president Greg Angelo described the "preservation of LGBT rights and support for the LGBT community" as hallmarks of [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016|Donald Trump's 2016 Presidential campaign]], and asserted that support would continue during his presidency.<ref>{{cite web|date = February 22, 2017|url = https://qz.com/915794/why-a-prominent-lgbt-rights-group-sees-hope-and-tremendous-opportunity-in-donald-trump/|title = Why a prominent LGBT rights group sees hope and "tremendous opportunity" in Donald Trump|first1 = Max|last1 = de Haldevang|first2 = Heather|last2 = Timmons|access-date = February 28, 2018|newspaper = [[Quartz (publication)|Quartz]]}}</ref> On that same day as these comments were made, the ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' reported that the Trump administration had rescinded Obama-era guidance on transgender students' rights.<ref>{{cite news|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/22/us/politics/devos-sessions-transgender-students-rights.html|title = Trump Rescinds Rules on Bathrooms for Transgender Students|first1 = Jeremy W.|last1 = Peters|first2 = Jo|last2 = Becker|first3 = Julie Hirschfeld|last3 = Davis|date = February 22, 2017|newspaper = [[The New York Times]]|access-date = February 28, 2018}}</ref> David Badash, editor-in-chief and founder of the ''[[The New Civil Rights Movement|New Civil Rights Movement]]'' has criticized the LCR for not opposing this action.<ref>{{cite news|title = Log Cabin Republicans Have Been Cheerleaders for Trump but on His Revoking Transgender Guidance, Crickets|first = David|last = Badash|newspaper = [[The New Civil Rights Movement]]|url = http://www.thenewcivilrightsmovement.com/davidbadash/log_cabin_republicans_have_been_cheerleaders_for_trump_but_on_his_revoking_transgender_guidance_crickets|date = February 23, 2018|access-date = February 28, 2018|publisher = [[JM Media Holdings]]}}</ref>  In 2017, Angelo described Trump as "the most pro-LGBT Republican president in history." In a February 2018 interview, he said that Trump recognizes marriage equality as the "settled law of the land, sent a letter of congratulations and commemoration [on Log Cabin’s 40th anniversary], and has people in his Cabinet who support marriage equality." Angelo therefore concluded that "Trump is even ''better'' for the LGBTQ community than former President Barack Obama," because Obama did not recognize marriage equality as "settled law" when he was inaugurated in 2009. (The [[Obergefell v. Hodges|Supreme Court did not rule]] until 2015.)<ref>{{cite news|title = Trump is even better for the LGBTQ community than former President Barack Obama|newspaper = [[The Huffington Post]]|date = February 28, 2018|access-date = February 28, 2018|author-link = Michelangelo Signorile|first = Michelangelo|last = Signorile|url = https://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/entry/log-cabin-republicans-donald-trump-lgbtq-rights_us_5a93901ae4b0ee6416a499df}}</ref>
