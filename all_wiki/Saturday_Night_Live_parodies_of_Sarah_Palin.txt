The [[sketch comedy]] television show ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' aired several critically acclaimed sketches parodying then [[Governor of Alaska|Alaskan Governor]] and vice-presidential nominee [[Sarah Palin]] in the lead-up to the [[2008 United States presidential election]]. The sketches featured former cast member [[Tina Fey]], who returned as a guest star to portray Palin. Fey won the [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series]] for her impersonation of Palin.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://goldderby.latimes.com/awards_goldderby/2009/09/you-betcha-tina-fey-wins-emmy-as-sarah-palin-on-snl-entertainment-news-2468097.html|title=You betcha&nbsp;— Tina Fey wins Emmy as Sarah Palin on 'SNL'|date=2009-09-13|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=2009-09-13}}</ref>

Viewers began to speculate who would play Palin on ''SNL'' during the run up to the November 4 presidential election. Days before the broadcast of the sketch, ''SNL'' executive producer [[Lorne Michaels]] said "there are [ongoing] discussions" about Fey playing Palin.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ccinsider.comedycentral.com/2008/09/12/tina-fey-might-play-sarah-palin/ |title=Tina Fey Might Play Sarah Palin |accessdate=2008-09-16 |last=Cordova |first=Gonzalo |date=2008-09-12 |publisher=[[Comedy Central]]}}</ref> On September 13, 2008, NBC announced that Fey would appear in the thirty-fourth-season premiere.<ref>{{cite news |first=Richard |last=Huff |title=''Saturday Night Live'' recalls Tina Fey to play Sarah Palin |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/2008/09/13/2008-09-13_saturday_night_live_recalls_tina_fey_to_.html |work=[[The New York Daily News]] |date=2008-09-13 |accessdate=2008-09-16}}</ref>

=="A Nonpartisan Message from Governor Sarah Palin & Senator Hillary Clinton"==
The first sketch, "A Nonpartisan Message from Governor Sarah Palin & Senator Hillary Clinton," aired during the [[Saturday Night Live (Season 34)|thirty-fourth season]] premiere of ''SNL'' on September 13, 2008. The sketch starred Tina Fey and [[Amy Poehler]] as Palin and Clinton, respectively.<ref name="nbcmv_1">{{cite press release|title=Tina Fey Guest Stars On ''Saturday Night Live'' Season Premiere As Republican Vice Presidential Candidate Gov.

Poehler and Fey are featured in a fictional speech playing New York [[United States Senate|Senator]] Hillary Rodham Clinton and [[Alaska Governor|Alaskan Governor]] Sarah Palin, respectively. The pair discuss the presence of [[sexism]] in the [[2008 United States presidential election]], and the differences between Palin and Clinton. Governor Palin was the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] vice-presidential nominee and Senator Clinton was a contender for the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] presidential nomination. Through the course of the message, Palin tries to present herself as the candidate for the job, and Clinton gets progressively more and more disgusted at Palin's sudden rise to fame as [[John McCain]]'s running mate, despite her background. It also features references to Clinton's campaign.

====Critical reception====
The sketch was well received by critics. Erin Fox of ''[[TV Guide]]'' wrote that Tina Fey "nails [Sarah] Palin's mannerisms and accent. [Amy] Poehler is amazing as Hillary [Clinton]; her timing is better than ever. My favorite line was Tina saying 'I can see Russia from my house!'" Fox added that "this was a much anticipated and hoped-for pairing and we got it!"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://community.tvguide.com/blog-entry/TV-Show-Blog/Saturday-Night-Live/Saturday-Night-Live/800046648 |title=Episode Recap: Michael Phelps Hosts, Lil Wayne Performs |accessdate=2008-09-16 |last=Fox |first=Erin |date=2008-09-14 |work=[[TV Guide]]}}</ref> Annie Wu of [[TV Squad]] thought that Fey's "impression wasn't perfect but it was more accurate than Amy Poehler's Hillary Clinton, which [she] still find[s] incredibly off."

====Palin's response====
When asked how she felt about Fey's portrayal, Sarah Palin replied, "I watched with the volume all the way down and I thought it was hilarious...

In a series of interviews, Palin made some "flubs" leading her to joke that "[she] was just trying to give Tina Fey more material." She also joked that it was to provide "job security for ''SNL'' characters."<ref>{{cite news |first=Foon |last=Rhee |title=Palin jokes about Tina Fey |url=http://www.boston.com/news/politics/politicalintelligence/2008/10/palin_jokes_abo.html |work=Boston Globe |date=2008-10-06 |accessdate=2008-10-09 }}</ref> Palin later remarked that she should appear on ''SNL'' to spoof a series of [[American Express]] commercials which featured Tina Fey.<ref>{{cite news |first=Chris |last=Rovzar |title=Sarah Palin Wants to Spoof Tina Fey on ''SNL'' |url=http://nymag.com/daily/intel/2008/10/sarah_palin_wants_to_spoof_tin.html?mid=daily-intel--20081006 |work=[[New York (magazine)|New York]] |date=2008-10-06 |accessdate=2008-10-09 }}</ref>

==Further Palin sketches==
Due to the popularity of the sketch and Fey's impression of Palin, Fey reprised her role during the September 27, 2008 episode. That sketch featured Palin being interviewed by [[Katie Couric]] (Amy Poehler), and parodied an [[Sarah Palin interviews with Katie Couric|interview]] which took place between Palin and Couric which aired days before the sketch's broadcast.<ref>{{cite news |title=Tina Fey As Sarah Palin: Katie Couric SNL Skit (VIDEO) |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/09/27/tina-fey-as-sarah-palin-k_n_129956.html |work=The Huffington Post |date=2008-09-27 |accessdate=2008-09-29 }}</ref> In the sketch, Fey quoted near verbatim one of Palin's answers from the actual interview and mimed Palin's gestures.  The following episode featured a skit parodying the debate between Palin and [[Joe Biden]] (played by [[Jason Sudeikis]]). [[Queen Latifah]] also appeared in the skit as moderator [[Gwen Ifill]].<ref>{{cite press release |title=''Saturday Night Live'' Welcomes Back Tina Fey And Queen Latifah For Their Take On The Vice Presidential Debate |publisher=[[NBC Universal]] Media Village |date=2008-10-05 |url=http://nbcumv.com/release_detail.nbc/entertainment-20081005000000-034saturdaynight.html |accessdate=2008-10-07 |quote=''SNL'' alum and ''[[30 Rock]]'' star Tina Fey returned to ''SNL'' tonight to reprise her wildly popular rendition of Republican VP candidate, Gov.

On November 1, 2008, Fey once again portrayed Palin, this time in a sketch featuring the real John McCain, the last of numerous sketches featuring the Arizona Senator. In the sketch, McCain poked fun at himself and his campaign, as well as [[Barack Obama]]'s purchase of airtime on several major networks earlier in the week.<ref>{{cite news|title=McCain shows funny side on 'Saturday Night Live' |agency=Agence France-Presse |url=http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5h6bctg7-NRMhhdMa50LeNRWb7TpA |accessdate=2008-11-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100908074157/http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5h6bctg7-NRMhhdMa50LeNRWb7TpA |archivedate=September 8, 2010 }}</ref> In the sketch, McCain and Palin can only afford to buy airtime on [[QVC]], a home-shopping channel. McCain's wife, [[Cindy McCain|Cindy]], also made an appearance in the sketch as herself.

After Palin's memoir, ''[[Going Rogue: An American Life]]'', achieved best-seller status through pre-orders,<ref>[https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jlxDCO3o2Lipkwnit2WjvF0TCa5gD9B1VRQ00] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091004234133/https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jlxDCO3o2Lipkwnit2WjvF0TCa5gD9B1VRQ00 |date=October 4, 2009 }}</ref> Fey announced she would resume impersonating the former Governor despite having "retired" the act months previously.<ref>{{cite news|title=Tina Fey ready to bring Sarah Palin impersonation out of retirement for Palin's book, 'Going Rogue'|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv/2009/10/07/2009-10-07_tiny_fey_ready_to_bring_sarah_palin_impersonation_out_of_retirement_for_palins_b.html | location=New York | work=Daily News | first=Jim | last=Farber | date=2009-10-07}}</ref> On April 10, 2010, Fey hosted ''SNL'', and once again played Palin, who unveiled her own television network featuring shows such as ''Hey Journalist, I Gotcha'', ''Todd!'' starring her husband [[Todd Palin]] (Jason Sudeikis) and ''Are You Smarter than a Half-Term Governor?''<ref>{{cite news|title=Tina Fey Unveils Palin's Next Career Move In Return To SNL|work=The Huffington Post|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/04/11/sarah-palin-network-video_n_533094.html|accessdate=2010-04-12|first=Alex|last=Leo|date=2010-04-11}}</ref> Fey hosted ''SNL'' in May 2011 while pregnant. A new sketch was made in which parodies of [[Mitt Romney]] ([[Jason Sudeikis]]), [[Newt Gingrich]] ([[Bobby Moynihan]]), [[Michele Bachmann]] ([[Kristen Wiig]]), Palin (Fey), [[Donald Trump]] ([[Darrell Hammond]]), and [[Jimmy McMillan]] ([[Kenan Thompson]]) fought in a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] debate between undeclared candidates, with [[Shepard Smith]] ([[Bill Hader]]) coordinating.

On March 11, 2012, on the episode hosted by [[Jonah Hill]], Palin was impersonated by [[Andy Samberg]] in the ''Weekend Update'' segment. The dialogue leads the audience to think that it was supposed to be another appearance by Fey and that [[Seth Meyers]] wasn't aware of the change, but Samberg convinces Meyers to finish his part.

Palin appeared on the ''[[Saturday Night Live 40th Anniversary Special]]'', where [[Jerry Seinfeld]] jokingly mistook her for Tina Fey.<ref>{{cite web|last=Morabito |first=Andrea |url=https://nypost.com/2015/02/16/the-8-best-moments-from-the-snl-40-anniversary-special/ |title=The 8 best moments from the 'SNL 40' anniversary special &#124; ''New York Post'' |publisher=Nypost.com |date=2015-02-16 |accessdate=2016-03-22}}</ref>

Fey and Poehler co-hosted ''SNL'' in December 2015, and performed as Palin and Clinton in yet another sketch. For their performance, the duo won the Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series.  This is the first time an acting category has been won by more than one person.  Additionally, this is the second win for Fey in the category for her performance as Palin and Poehler's first Emmy win after 18 nominations.<ref>{{cite web|author=Julia Brucculieri Entertainment Writer, The Huffington Post |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/tina-fey-amy-poehler-snl_5676b852e4b06fa6887db367 |title=Tina Fey And Amy Poehler Bring Sarah Palin And Hillary Clinton Back To 'SNL' |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |date=2015-12-20 |accessdate=2016-03-22}}</ref>

In January 2016, following Palin's real-life endorsement of [[Donald Trump]], Fey returned to the role to parody the speech given by Palin in Iowa that endorsed Trump. This skit served as the show's cold open.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2016/01/24/tina-fey-nails-sarah-palin-impression-during-saturday-night-live-donald-trump-endorsement-sketch-video_n_9063950.html |title=Tina Fey Nails Sarah Palin Impression During ''Saturday Night Live'' Donald Trump Endorsement Sketch (VIDEO) |publisher=Huffingtonpost.co.uk |date=2016-01-24 |accessdate=2016-03-22|author-link=title }}</ref>
