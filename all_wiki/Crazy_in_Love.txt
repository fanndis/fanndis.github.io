"'''Crazy in Love'''" is a song recorded by American singer [[Beyoncé]] featuring American rapper [[Jay-Z]] from Beyoncé's debut solo [[studio album]] ''[[Dangerously in Love]]'' (2003). It was released as the album's lead single on May 18, 2003 through [[Columbia Records]] and [[Music World Entertainment]]. Both artists wrote and composed the song in collaboration with [[Rich Harrison]] and [[Eugene Record]]; the former also produced it with Beyoncé. Using [[sampling (music)|samples]] from [[The Chi-Lites]]'s 1970 song "Are You My Woman (Tell Me So)", "Crazy in Love" is a [[contemporary R&B]] and [[Pop music|pop]] love song that incorporates elements of [[Hip hop music|hip hop]], [[Soul music|soul]], and 1970s-style [[funk]] music. Its lyrics describe a romantic obsession that causes the protagonist to act out of character.

"Crazy in Love" was a number-one hit in the United States and United Kingdom, and reached the top ten in various other countries worldwide. [[Music journalism|Music critics]] praised the [[Hook (music)|hook]], Jay-Z's contribution, and Beyoncé's assertive delivery of the lyrics. [[VH1]] declared it the greatest song of the 2000s decade, while ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' ranked it at number 118 on their list of [[the 500 greatest songs of all time]] in 2010, and in 2018, declared the song, the greatest of the [[21st century]] so far.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/the-100-greatest-songs-of-the-century-so-far-666874/|title=The 100 Greatest Songs of the Century – So Far|last=Hermes|first=Christian Hoard,Christopher R.

The song's accompanying [[music video]] features Beyoncé in various dance sequences. It won three awards at the [[2003 MTV Video Music Awards]], and its director, [[Jake Nava]], won the Music Video Production Association award for Best R&B Video in 2004. Since 2003, "Crazy in Love" has been a staple in Beyoncé's live performances and concert tours. The [[American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers]] (ASCAP) recognized "Crazy in Love" as one of the most performed songs of 2004. Artists including [[David Byrne]] have [[Cover version|covered]] the song, and it has been used in various television shows and other media.

By July 2002, Beyoncé had already recorded several songs which would appear on ''[[Dangerously in Love]].'' [[Columbia Records]] planned to release the album in October 2002; however, the release was postponed several times to capitalize on the success of American rapper [[Nelly]]'s 2002 single "[[Dilemma (song)|Dilemma]]," which features Beyoncé's former [[Destiny's Child]] member [[Kelly Rowland]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Moss |first=Corey |title=Nelly Hit Forces Change In Plans For Destiny's Child LPs |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1456206/20020722/destinys_child.jhtml |publisher=[[MTV News]]. [[MTV Networks]] |date=July 22, 2002 |access-date=February 10, 2011}}</ref> These delays allowed Beyoncé to record more songs for the album.<ref name="independent" />

Before meeting Beyoncé, [[Rich Harrison]] had conceptualized the [[Beat (music)|beat]] of the song.<ref name="Angelo">{{cite web |last=D'Angelo |first=Joe |title=Road To The Grammys: The Making of Beyoncé's 'Crazy In Love' |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1484784/20040203/Beyoncé_beyonce.jhtml |publisher=[[MTV News]].

People do not really get it and you will leave them with a foul taste in their mouth."<ref name="Angelo" />

Harrison was pleasantly surprised when he got a call from Beyoncé, who was working on one of the most anticipated albums of the year.<ref name="Angelo" /> However, things did not turn up according to his plans the following day, as he was late and was still suffering the effects of a hangover.<ref name="Angelo" /> When Harrison played the sample to Beyoncé in the studio, the singer initially had doubts about the "sound so full of blaring fanfare;"<ref name="Angelo" /> it seemed too retro and according to her, no one used [[French horn|horn riffs]] in the 21st century.<ref name="independent" /> Nevertheless, Beyoncé became friendlier to the sample, much to Harrison's delight, and gave him two hours to write and compose the song while she went out.<ref name="Angelo" />

Harrison confessed that it was not easy for him to come up with the lyrics to "Crazy in Love" in that length of time.<ref name="independent" /> But two hours later, he had written the [[Song structure (popular music)|verses]], and the hook, in spite of being hung over.<ref name="Angelo" /> Harrison had also made provision for a [[backing track]];<ref name="independent" /> he played all the instruments on the track.<ref name="Angelo" /> The [[Bridge (music)|bridge]] was written by Beyoncé,<ref name="Angelo" /> who was inspired by looking at herself in the mirror;<ref name="independent" /> as she was not wearing matching clothes and her hair was untidy, she kept saying, "I'm looking so crazy right now."<ref name="Uh-oh" /> Harrison sang back to her and said, "That's the hook."<ref name="Uh-oh" /> It also inspired the title of the song.<ref name="independent" /> After that Beyoncé had filled up the [[middle eight]], she came up with the catchphrase – "Uh-oh, uh-oh, you know" – alongside Harrison.<ref name="Uh-oh" />

American rapper [[Jay-Z]] became involved late in the song's production.<ref name="Angelo" /> Around 3 a.m., he came to the studio and recorded a [[rapping|rap verse]], which he improvised in about ten minutes.<ref name="independent" /><ref>{{Cite book |last=Horn |first=Geoffrey |title=Beyoncé |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ODW4LBtLBWUC&q=beyonce+crazy+in+love&pg=PA27 |publisher=[[Gareth Stevens]] |year=2006 |isbn=0-8368-4230-8 |access-date=February 10, 2011 |page=27}}</ref> The recording of "Crazy in Love" took place nearly three months following the meeting of Beyoncé with Harrison.<ref name="Uh-oh">{{cite news |title=Uh-oh!

According to Natalie Nichols of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]],'' the lyrics of "Crazy in Love" reference a state of romantic obsession.<ref name="Nichols" /> Beyoncé said that the song talks "about how, when you are falling in love, you do things that are out of character and you do not really care because you are just open."<ref>{{cite web|title=Hurricane Beyoncé |url=http://www.dennishensley.com/Beyonce.htm |publisher=Dennis Hensley |access-date=February 6, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110709013138/http://www.dennishensley.com/Beyonce.htm |archive-date=July 9, 2011 }}</ref> Anthony DeCurtis of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' wrote that "Crazy in Love" has "such a cauldron of energy," that Beyoncé sounds "loose and sexy," gripped by emotions she "can neither understand nor control."<ref name="rol" /> The lyrics are composed in the traditional [[verse-chorus form]]. Jay Z opens the song with a brief spoken verse-rap, containing the lyrics: "Yes! So crazy right now. Most incredibly, it's your girl, B. It's your boy, Young. You ready?"<ref name="Sheet" /> After Beyoncé delivers the "uh-oh, uh-oh" catchphrase, Jay Z continues the monologue.<ref name="ent" /> Beyoncé begins the first verse, followed with the [[Whistling|whistle]]-backed [[Refrain|chorus]].<ref name="the times" /> She repeats the "uh-oh, uh-oh" phrase, leading to the second verse. The chorus follows, giving way to the second verse-rap which contains the lyrics: "Jay Z in the range, crazy and deranged [...] I been iller than chain smokers, how you think I got the name 'Hova', I been real and the game's over".<ref name="pop" /> The song continues to the bridge, singing: "I'm not myself, lately I'm foolish, I don't do this, / I've been playing myself, baby, I don't care / 'Cuz your love's got the best of me, / And baby, you're making a fool of me, / You got me sprung and I don't care who sees."<ref name="popmatters1" /> She then sings the chorus again and the song fades out with the horns.<ref name="Sheet" />

==Music video==

===Production===
The [[music video]] of "Crazy in Love", released in May 2003, was directed by [[Jake Nava]] and filmed in downtown [[Los Angeles]].<ref>{{Cite news |last=Chin |first=Marcos |title=Jake Nava |date=September 30, 2004|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yyYEAAAAMBAJ&q=Beyonce+Crazy+in+Love+director+Jake+Nava&pg=PA150 |work=Vibe |publisher=InterMedia Partners |access-date=February 10, 2011}}</ref> In ''MTV Making of the Video'' 2003 documentary, Beyoncé described the video's conception: "[It] celebrates the evolution of a woman. It is about a girl who is at the point of a relationship. She realizes that she is in love, she is doing stuff she would not normally do but she does not care. It does not matter she is just crazy in love."<ref>{{cite web |title=Making the Video: Beyonce 'Crazy In Love' |publisher=MTV. MTV Networks |date=June 2003}}</ref>

===Synopsis===
The opening sequence of the video features Jay-Z as a passenger in a car speeding along Mission Road in Los Angeles, where he encounters Beyoncé, standing in the middle of the road, at the Fourth Street bridge. Beyoncé performs in various dance sequences, beginning with her wearing a white tank top, denim blue shorts, and red high-heels. She performs an elaborate solo dance on a riser. The scene shifts to a gold set with a mock photo shoot, before moving into a scene with dancers detailing Beyoncé and dancing against a wall while wearing caps and full length pants. Jay Z appears and ignites a line of petrol leading to a car parked under the bridge, which explodes in flames. Jay Z performs his rap in front of the burning car, and Beyoncé dances beside him, wearing an exotic silk print over a fur coat, before kicking the valve off a fire hydrant. She continues to dance while the water is flying everywhere. The video ends with Beyoncé and her dancers wearing vibrant [[Versace]] dresses in front of a large fan. Their outfits contrast with the neutral colors of the background, the video. [[Carmit Bachar]], then a member of [[The Pussycat Dolls]], is one of the dancers.

===Reception===
The music video received acclaim by [[music critics]]. Cynthia Fuchs, writing for PopMatters commented that the photo shoot scene uses the routine used by [[Jennifer Lopez]] in the video for "[[Jenny from the Block]]" (2002) with hot lights, scary makeup, and inclusion of many shots of legs.<ref name="popmatters1" /> She wrote that: "Beyoncé's body becomes its undeniable emblem. Tom Moon of ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'' wrote that Beyoncé shakes every inch of her famously photogenic goddess frame."<ref name="popmatters1">{{cite magazine|url=https://www.popmatters.com/pm/feature/030724-beyonce/ |title=You Gotta Work Your Jelly |last=Fuchs |first=Cynthia |magazine=[[PopMatters]] |date=July 24, 2003 |access-date=February 20, 2011}}</ref>

"Crazy in Love" has various remixes, including the [[Rockwilder]] remix, [[Maurice Joshua]]'s Nu Soul remix, and Juniors World remix.

Margot said: "It inspires me to work on other artists' songs [because] it pushes my boundaries in a direction that I wouldn't necessarily come up with. Obviously I know how 'Crazy in Love' goes, but I knew there was the possibility her vocals would be different. It's almost more vulnerable and beautiful this way, because you ''do'' do crazy things when you fall in love. To hear the mood reversed and flipped makes it even more powerful."<ref>{{cite web|last1=Feeney|first1=Nolan |title=Fifty Shades of Grey: The Story Behind Beyoncé's "Crazy In Love" Update |url=http://time.com/3030920/beyonce-50-shades-of-grey-crazy-in-love/|website=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |access-date=July 25, 2014 |date=July 24, 2014}}</ref>
