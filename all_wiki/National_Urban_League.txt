The '''National Urban League''', formerly known as the '''National League on Urban Conditions Among Negroes''', is a nonpartisan historic [[civil rights]] organization based in New York City that advocates on behalf of economic and social justice for [[African American]]s and against [[racial discrimination in the United States]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Mission and History |url=https://nul.org/mission-and-history |website=National Urban League |accessdate=12 April 2020}}</ref> It is the oldest and largest [[community-based organization]] of its kind in the nation. Its current President is [[Marc Morial]].

==History==
[[File:UrbanLeagueHoustonTX.JPG|thumb|right|Houston Area Urban League building in [[Downtown Houston]]]]

The '''Committee on Urban Conditions Among Negroes''' was founded in New York City on September 29, 1910 by [[Ruth Standish Baldwin]] and Dr. [[George Edmund Haynes]], among others.<ref>Parris, Guichard and Lester Brooks. ''Blacks in the City: A History of the National Urban League''. Boston: Little, Brown and Company. 1971. p. 28.</ref>  It merged with the '''Committee for the Improvement of Industrial Conditions Among Negroes''' in New York (founded in New York in 1906) and the '''National League for the Protection of Colored Women''' (founded in 1905), and was renamed the '''National League on Urban Conditions Among Negroes'''.<ref>Dodson, N. "NEW CHAPTER IN SOCIAL UPLIFT." Afro-American (1893-1988): 2. Dec 30 1911. ProQuest. Web. 6 Feb. 2016.</ref><ref>Parris, Guichard and Lester Brooks. ''Blacks in the City: A History of the National Urban League''. Boston: Little, Brown and Company. 1971. pp. 32-34.</ref> Haynes served as the organization's first Executive Director.

In 1918, [[Eugene Kinckle Jones|Eugene K. Jones]] took the leadership of the organization. Under his direction, the League significantly expanded its multifaceted campaign to crack the barriers to black employment, spurred first by the boom years of the 1920s, and then by the desperate years of the [[Great Depression]].<ref>Armfield, Felix L. ''Eugene Kinckle Jones: The National Urban League and Black Social Work, 1910-1940''. Urbana : University of Illinois Press, 2012.</ref>

In 1920, the organization took the present name, the National Urban League.<ref>Parris, Guichard and Lester Brooks. ''Blacks in the City: A History of the National Urban League''. Boston: Little, Brown and Company. 1971.</ref> The mission of the Urban League movement, as stated by the National Urban League, is "to enable African Americans to secure economic self-reliance, parity, power and civil rights."<ref name="nul">"[http://nul.iamempowered.com/who-we-are/mission-and-history Mission and History]." ''National Urban League''. Accessed 6 February 2016.</ref>

Jones played a significant role in President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s administration, taking leave from the League to head the Department of Commerce unit for the study of "Negro problems," and serving as part of a group of African-American advisors known as the "[[Black Cabinet]]."<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title=Empowering Communities, Changing Lives: 100 Years of the National Urban League|last=Smith|first=Alonzo|publisher=The Donning Company|year=2011|isbn=978-1-57864-683-8|location=New York City|pages=72}}</ref>

In 1941, [[Lester Granger]] was appointed Executive Secretary and led the NUL's effort to support the [[March on Washington Movement|March on Washington]] proposed by [[A. Philip Randolph]], [[Bayard Rustin]] and [[A. J. Muste]] to protest racial discrimination in defense work and the military.<ref>Thomas, Jesse. "Urban League Bulletin." The Atlanta Constitution (1881-1945): 1. Jan 25 1942. ProQuest. Web. 6 Feb. 2016.</ref> A week before the March was scheduled to take place, President Roosevelt issued an executive order creating the [[Fair Employment Practice Committee|Fair Employment Practices Committee]].<ref name=":0" />

In the wake of [[World War II]], Black veterans who fought racial hatred overseas returned to the United States determined to fight it at home, giving new energy to the [[Civil Rights Movement]]. As hundreds of thousands of new jobs opened up, shifting the economy from industrial manufacturing to a white-collar, service-oriented economy, the National Urban League turned its attention to placing [[Historically black colleges and universities|HBCU]] graduates in professional positions.<ref name=":0" />

In 1961, [[Whitney Young]] became executive director amidst the expansion of activism in the civil rights movement, which provoked a change for the League. Young substantially expanded the League's fund-raising ability and made the League a full partner in the civil rights movement.<ref name=":0" /> In 1963, the League hosted the planning meetings of [[A. Philip Randolph]], [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] and other civil rights leaders for the August [[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom]].  During Young's ten-year tenure at the League, he initiated programs such as "Street Academy," an alternative education system to prepare [[high school dropout]]s for college; and "New Thrust," an effort to help local black leaders identify and solve community problems. Young also pushed for federal aid to cities.

[[Clarence M. Pendleton, Jr.]], was from 1975 to 1981, the head of the Urban League in [[San Diego, California]]. In 1981, U.S. President [[Ronald W. Reagan]] tapped Pendleton as the chairman of the [[United States Commission on Civil Rights]], a position which he held until his sudden death in 1988. Pendleton sought to steer the commission into the [[Conservative (politics)|conservative]] direction in line with Reagan's views on social and civil rights policies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uky.edu/Libraries/nkaa/record.php?note_id=1144|title=Notable Kentucky African Americans Database|publisher=uky.edu|accessdate=March 19, 2013}}</ref>

In 1994, [[Hugh Bernard Price|Hugh Price]] was appointed as president of the Urban League.

In 2003, [[Marc Morial]], former [[List of mayors of New Orleans|mayor of New Orleans, Louisiana]], was appointed the league's eighth President and Chief Executive Officer. He worked to reenergize the movement's diverse constituencies by building on the legacy of the organization and increasing the profile of the organization.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}
