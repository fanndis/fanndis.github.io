A '''whistleblower''' (also written as '''whistle-blower''' or '''whistle blower''')<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=whistleblower|title=The American Heritage Dictionary entry: whistleblower|first=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Publishing|last=Company|website=www.ahdictionary.com}}</ref> is a person, usually an employee, who exposes information or activity within a private, public, or government organization that is deemed illegal, illicit, unsafe, or a waste, fraud, or abuse of taxpayer funds. Those who become whistleblowers can choose to bring information or allegations to surface either internally or externally. Over 83% of whistleblowers report internally to a supervisor, human resources, compliance or a neutral third party within the company, with the thought that the company will address and correct the issues.  Externally, a whistleblower can bring allegations to light by contacting a third party outside of the organization such as the media, government, or law enforcement. {{fact|date=October 2020}} Even though it is illegal in many countries, including the United States, over 90% of whistleblowers report being retaliated against from those who are accused or alleged of wrongdoing, on behalf of the company. {{fact|date=October 2020}} The most common type of retaliation reported is being abruptly terminated. However, there are several other activities that are considered retaliatory, such as sudden extreme increase in workloads, having hours cut drastically, making task completion impossible or otherwise bullying measures. <ref>{{Cite book|last=Vandekerckhove|first=Wim|title=Whistleblowing and Organizational Social Responsibility : A Global Assessment.|publisher=Ashgate|year=2006}}</ref>Because of this, a number of laws exist to protect whistleblowers. Some third-party groups even offer protection to whistleblowers, but that protection can only go so far. Two other classifications of whistleblowing are private and public. The classifications relate to the type of organizations the whistleblower works in: [[private sector]], or [[public sector]]. Depending on many factors, both can have varying results. About 20% of whistleblowers are successful in stopping the illegal behaviors, usually through the legal system, with the help of a whistleblower attorney. In order for the whistleblowers claims to be credible and successful, the whistleblower must have compelling evidence to support their claims, that the government or regulating body can use or investigate to "prove" such claims and hold corrupt companies, government agencies and or accountable. A whistleblower case would never continue on legally, or ever be reported via the news, without substantial and compelling evidence.

Deeper questions and theories of whistleblowing and why people choose to do so can be studied through an [[ethical]] approach. Whistleblowing is a topic of several myths and inaccurate definitions. Leading arguments in the ideological camp, maintain that whistleblowing is the most basic of ethical traits and simply telling the truth in order to stop illegal harmful activities, or fraud against the government/taxpayers.<ref name="Delmas2015">{{Cite journal |jstor = 24332319|title = The Ethics of Government Whistleblowing|journal = Social Theory and Practice|volume = 41|issue = 1|pages = 77–105|last1 = Delmas|first1 = Candice|year = 2015|doi = 10.5840/soctheorpract20154114|url = https://philpapers.org/rec/DELTEO-20}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.1111/0047-2786.00103 |title = Whistleblowers and the Narrative of Ethics|journal = Journal of Social Philosophy|volume = 32|issue = 3|pages = 402–418|year = 2001|last1 = Alford|first1 = C.

However, the decision and action has become far more complicated with recent advancements in technology and [[communication]].<ref name="Delmas2015" /> 

==Overview==
===Origin of term===
U.S. civic activist [[Ralph Nader]] is said to have coined the phrase, but he in fact put a positive spin on the term<ref>See: New Scientist 9 Dec. 1971, p. 69: "The Code [of Good Conduct of The British Computer Society] contains secrecy clauses that effectively prohibit Nader style whistle-blowing"</ref> in the early 1970s to avoid the negative connotations found in other words such as "informer" and "snitch".<ref>Nader, Petkas, and Blackwell, Whistleblowing (1972).</ref> However, the origins of the word date back to the [[19th century]].

The word is linked to the use of a [[whistle]] to alert the public or a crowd about a bad situation, such as the commission of a crime or the breaking of rules during a game. The phrase ''whistle blower'' attached itself to law enforcement officials in the 19th century because they used a whistle to alert the public or fellow police.<ref name="Meaning and origin">{{cite web|title=The meaning and origin of the expression: Whistle-blower|url=http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/whistle-blower.html|website=The Phrase Finder|publisher=Gary Martin|access-date=27 January 2017}}</ref> Sports referees, who use a whistle to indicate an illegal or foul play, also were called whistle blowers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=whistleblower+&searchmode=none |title=Etymonline.com |publisher=Etymonline.com |access-date=2012-07-08}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wordorigins.org/index.php/site/whistleblower/ |title=Wordorigins.org |publisher=Wordorigins.org |access-date=2012-07-08}}</ref>

An 1883 story in the ''Janesville Gazette'' called a policeman who used his whistle to alert citizens about a riot a ''whistle blower'', without the hyphen. By the year 1963, the phrase had become a hyphenated word, ''whistle-blower''. The word began to be used by journalists in the 1960s for people who revealed wrongdoing, such as Nader. It eventually evolved into the compound word ''whistleblower''.<ref name="Meaning and origin" />

===Internal===
Most whistleblowers are internal whistleblowers, who report misconduct on a fellow employee or superior within their company through anonymous reporting mechanisms often called hotlines.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Business Ethics: Ethical Decision Making and Cases|publisher=Cengage Learning|year=2017|isbn=978-1305500846|pages=194}}</ref> One of the most interesting questions with respect to internal whistleblowers is why and under what circumstances do people either act on the spot to stop illegal and otherwise unacceptable behavior or report it.<ref>Dealing with—or reporting—"unacceptable" behavior (with additional thoughts about the "Bystander Effect") Mary Rowe MIT, Linda Wilcox HMS, Howard Gadlin NIH (2009), ''Journal of the International Ombudsman Association'' 2(1), online at [http://www.ombudsassociation.org/publications/journal/ ombudsassociation.org]{{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090504071949/http://www.ombudsassociation.org/publications/journal/ |date=2009-05-04 }}</ref> There are some reasons to believe that people are more likely to take action with respect to unacceptable behavior, within an organization, if there are [[complaint systems]] that offer not just options dictated by the planning and control organization, but a ''choice'' of options for absolute confidentiality.<ref>Mary Rowe, "Options and choice for conflict resolution in the workplace" in ''Negotiation: Strategies for Mutual Gain'', by Lavinia Hall (ed.), Sage Publications, Inc., 1993, pp. 105–119.</ref>

Anonymous reporting mechanisms,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2014/10/25/elements-of-an-effective-whistleblower-hotline/|title=Elements of an Effective Whistleblower Hotline|website=corpgov.law.harvard.edu}}</ref> as mentioned previously, help foster a climate whereby employees are more likely to report or seek guidance regarding potential or actual wrongdoing without fear of retaliation. The coming anti-bribery management systems standard, [[ISO 37001]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail?csnumber=65034|title=ISO 37001:2016 - Anti-bribery management systems -- Requirements with guidance for use|website=www.iso.org}}</ref> includes anonymous reporting as one of the criteria for the new standard.

===External===
External whistleblowers, however, report misconduct to outside persons or entities. In these cases, depending on the information's severity and nature, whistleblowers may report the misconduct to [[lawyer]]s, the [[Mass media|media]], [[Law enforcement agency|law enforcement]] or [[consumer protection|watchdog agencies]], or other local, state, or federal agencies. In some cases, external whistleblowing is encouraged by offering monetary reward.

===Third party===
Sometimes it is beneficial for an organization to use an external agency to create a secure and anonymous reporting channel for its employees, often referred to as a whistleblowing hotline. As well as protecting the identity of the whistleblower, these services are designed to inform the individuals at the top of the organizational pyramid of misconduct, usually via integration with specialised [[case management software]].

Implementing a third party solution is often the easiest way for an organization to ensure [[Governance, risk management, and compliance|compliance]], or to offer a whistleblowing policy where one did not previously exist. An increasing number of companies and authorities use third party services in which the whistleblower is anonymous also towards the third party service provider, which is made possible via toll free phone numbers and/or web or app-based solutions which apply [[Public-key cryptography|asymmetrical encryption]].

===Private sector whistleblowing===
Private sector whistleblowing, though not as high profile as public sector whistleblowing, is arguably more prevalent and suppressed in society today.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = The Rise of the Whistleblower and the Death of Privacy Impact of 9/11 and Enron|last = Castagnera|first = James|date = Spring 2003|journal = Labor Law Journal}}</ref> Simply because private corporations usually have stricter regulations that suppress potential whistleblowers. An example of private sector whistleblowing is when an employee reports to someone in a higher position such as a manager, or a third party that is isolated from the individual chapter, such as their lawyer or the police. In the private sector, corporate groups can easily hide wrongdoings by individual branches. It is not until these wrongdoings bleed into the top officials that corporate wrongdoings are seen by the public. Situations in which a person may blow the whistle are in cases of violated laws or company policy, such as sexual harassment or theft. These instances, nonetheless, are small compared to [[money laundering]] or [[fraud]] charges on the [[stock market]]. Whistleblowing in the private sector is typically not as high-profile or openly discussed in major news outlets, though occasionally, third parties expose human rights violations and [[exploitation of labour|exploitation of workers]].<ref>{{Cite book|title = Where am I wearing?|last = Timmerman|first = Kelsey|publisher = California: Wiley|year = 2012}}</ref> While there are organizations such as the [[United States Department of Labor]] (DOL), and laws in place such as the [[Sarbanes–Oxley Act|Sarbanes-Oxley Act]] and the [[United States Federal Sentencing Guidelines]] for Organizations (FSGO) which protects whistleblowers in the private sector, many employees still fear for their jobs due to direct or indirect threats from their employers or the other parties involved. In the United States, the Department of Labor's [https://www.whistleblowers.gov/ Whistleblower Protection Program] can take many types of retaliation claims based on legal actions an employee took or was perceived to take in the course of their employment.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.whistleblowers.gov/about-us|title=Whistleblower Protection {{!}} Whistleblower Protection Program|website=www.whistleblowers.gov|access-date=2019-12-06}}</ref> Conversely, if in the United States the retaliatory conduct occurred due to the perception of who the employee is as a person, the [https://www.eeoc.gov/ Equal Employment Opportunity Commission] may be able to accept a complaint of retaliation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/index.cfm|title=About the EEOC: Overview|website=www.eeoc.gov|access-date=2019-12-06}}</ref> In an effort to overcome those fears, in 2010 [[Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act]] was put forth to provide great incentive to whistleblowers. For example, if a whistleblower gave information which could be used to legally recover over one million dollars; then they could receive ten to thirty percent of it.

Whistleblowers have risen within the technology industry as it has expanded in recent years. They are vital for publicizing ethical breaches within private companies. Protection for these specific whistleblowers falls short; they often end up unemployed or worse- in jail. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act offers an incentive for private sector whistleblowers, but only if they go to the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission|SEC]] with information.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/business/hiltzik/la-fi-hiltzik-whistleblowers-high-tech-20180713-story.html|title=Column: Whistleblowers need help. This tech entrepreneur wants to provide it|last=Hiltzik|first=Michael|date=July 12, 2018|website=The LA Times}}</ref> If a whistleblower acts internally, as they often do in the technology industry, they are not protected by the law. Scandals, such as the [[Dragonfly (search engine)|Dragonfly]] search engine scandal and the [[Snapchat|Pompliano]] lawsuit against snapchat, have drawn attention to whistleblowers in technology.

Despite government efforts to help regulate the private sector, the employees must still weigh their options. They either expose the company and stand the moral and ethical high ground; or expose the company, lose their job, their reputation and potentially the ability to be employed again. According to a study at the University of Pennsylvania, out of three hundred whistleblowers studied, sixty nine percent of them had foregone that exact situation; and they were either fired or were forced to retire after taking the ethical high ground. It is outcomes like that which makes it all that much harder to accurately track how prevalent whistleblowing is in the private sector.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Business Ethics: Ethical Decision Making and Case 10th Edition|publisher=O.C.

===Public sector whistleblowing===
[[File:Praha, Magistrát, konference, Libor Michálek.jpg|thumb|170px|Czech whistleblower [[Libor Michálek]] was fired from his position after exposing high-level corruption]]
Recognizing the public value of whistleblowing has been increasing over the last 50 years. In the United States, both state and Federal statutes have been put in place to protect whistleblowers from retaliation. The [[United States Supreme Court]] ruled that public sector whistleblowers are protected under [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] rights from any job retaliation when they raise flags over alleged corruption.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|title = Whistleblowing|url = http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Whistleblowing|access-date = 2015-05-06}}</ref> Exposing misconduct or illegal or dishonest activity is a big fear for public employees because they feel they are going against their government and country. Private sector whistleblowing protection laws were in place long before ones for the public sector. After many federal whistleblowers were scrutinized in high-profile media cases, laws were finally introduced to protect government whistleblowers. These laws were enacted to help prevent corruption and encourage people to expose misconduct, illegal, or dishonest activity for the good of society.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.1177/009102601104000405 |title = Whistleblower Retaliation in the Public Sector|journal = Public Personnel Management|volume = 40|issue = 4|pages = 341–348|year = 2011|last1 = Lee|first1 = Katie|last2 = Kleiner|first2 = Brian|s2cid = 153833481}}</ref> People who choose to act as whistleblowers often suffer retaliation from their employer. They most likely are fired because they are an [[at-will employee]], which means they can be fired without a reason. There are exceptions in place for whistleblowers who are at-will employees. Even without a statute, numerous decisions encourage and protect whistleblowing on grounds of public policy. Statutes state that an employer shall not take any adverse employment actions any employee in retaliation for a good-faith report of a whistleblowing action or cooperating in any way in an investigation, proceeding, or lawsuit arising under said action.<ref name=":0" /> Federal whistleblower legislation includes a statute protecting all government employees. In the federal civil service, the government is prohibited from taking, or threatening to take, any personnel action against an employee because the employee disclosed information that they reasonably believed showed a violation of law, gross mismanagement, and gross waste of funds, abuse of authority, or a substantial and specific danger to public safety or health. To prevail on a claim, a federal employee must show that a protected disclosure was made, that the accused official knew of the disclosure, that retaliation resulted, and that there was a genuine connection between the retaliation and the employee's action.<ref name=":0" /> 

===Harm===
Individual harm, public trust damage, and a threat of national security are three categories of harm that may come as a result of whistleblowing. Revealing a whistleblower's identity can automatically put their life in danger. Some media outlets associate words like "traitor" and "treason" with whistleblowers, and in many countries around the world, the punishment for treason is the [[capital punishment|death penalty]], even if whoever allegedly committed treason may not have caused anyone physical harm. A primary argument in favor of the death penalty for treason is the potential endangerment of an entire people. In other words, the perpetrator is perceived as being responsible for any harm that befalls the country or its citizens as a result of their actions. In some instances, whistleblowers must flee their country to avoid public scrutiny, threats of death or physical harm, and in some cases criminal charges.

In a few cases, harm is done by the whistleblower to innocent people.<ref name=":3">{{Cite web|url=https://thewalrus.ca/the-whistle-blower-who-got-it-wrong/|title=The Whistle-blower Who Got It Wrong|last=Gold|first=Kerry|date=2019-08-14|website=The Walrus|language=en-US|access-date=2019-08-25}}</ref> Whistleblowers can make unintentional mistakes, and investigations can be tainted by the fear of negative publicity.<ref name=":3" /> One case of this was claims made in part of the Canadian health ministry, by a new employee who thought that nearly every research contract she saw in 2012 involved malfeasance.<ref name=":3" /><ref name=":4">{{Cite web|url=https://www.bcombudsperson.ca/documents/misfire-2012-ministry-health-employment-terminations-and-related-matters|title=Misfire: The 2012 Ministry of Health Employment Terminations and Related Matters {{!}} Office of the Ombudsperson|date=2017-04-06|website=British Columbia Office of the Ombudsperson|access-date=2019-08-25}}</ref> The end result was the sudden firing of seven people, false and public threats of a criminal investigation, and the death of one researcher by suicide.<ref name=":3" /><ref name=":4" /> The government ultimately paid the innocent victims millions of dollars for lost pay, slander, and other harms, in addition to CA $2.41 million spent on the subsequent 2015 investigation into the false charges.<ref name=":3" /><ref name=":4" />

===Common reactions===
[[File:Mordechai Vanunu 2009.jpg|thumb|170px|[[Mordechai Vanunu]] spent 18 years in prison, including more than 11 in solitary confinement.]]
Whistleblowers are sometimes seen as selfless [[Martyr (politics)|martyrs]] for public interest and organizational [[accountability]]; others view them as "traitors" or "defectors". Some even accuse them of solely pursuing personal glory and fame, or view their behavior as motivated by greed in [[qui tam]] cases. Some academics (such as [[Thomas Faunce]]) feel that whistleblowers should at least be entitled to a rebuttable presumption that they are attempting to apply ethical principles in the face of obstacles and that whistleblowing would be more respected in [[governance]] systems if it had a firmer academic basis in [[virtue ethics]].<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1007/BF03351419|pmid = 15688511|title = Developing and teaching the virtue-ethics foundations of healthcare whistle blowing|journal = Monash Bioethics Review|volume = 23|issue = 4|pages = 41–55|year = 2004|last1 = Faunce|first1 = Thomas|ssrn=1408402|s2cid = 1416298|url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b0715eea8ccb2fc6f4362ae1803b465f252ee143}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |pmid = 17970253|year = 2007|last1 = Faunce|first1 = T.

It is probable that many people do not even consider blowing the whistle, not only because of fear of retaliation, but also because of fear of losing their relationships at work and outside work.<ref>Rowe, Mary & Bendersky, Corinne, "Workplace Justice, Zero Tolerance and Zero Barriers: Getting People to Come Forward in Conflict Management Systems," in ''Negotiations and Change, From the Workplace to Society'', Thomas Kochan and Richard Locke (eds), Cornell University Press, 2002.

''Persecution of whistleblowers'' has become a serious issue in many parts of the world:
<blockquote>
Employees in academia, business or government might become aware of serious risks to health and the environment, but internal policies might pose threats of retaliation to those who report these early warnings. Private company employees in particular might be at risk of being fired, demoted, denied raises and so on for bringing environmental risks to the attention of appropriate authorities. Government employees could be at a similar risk for bringing threats to health or the environment to public attention, although perhaps this is less likely.<ref name=late>{{cite web |url=http://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/late-lessons-2 |title=Late lessons from early warnings: science, precaution, innovation: Full Report |author=European Environment Agency) |date=Jan 23, 2013 |page=614 }}</ref>
</blockquote>

There are examples of "early warning scientists" being harassed for bringing inconvenient truths about impending harm to the notice of the public and authorities. {{fact|date=October 2020}} There have also been cases of young scientists being discouraged from entering controversial scientific fields for fear of [[harassment]].<ref name=late/>

Whistleblowers are often protected under law from employer retaliation, but in many cases punishment has occurred, such as [[termination of employment|termination]], [[suspension (punishment)|suspension]], [[demotion]], [[wage garnishment]], and/or harsh [[mistreatment]] by other employees. A 2009 study found that up to 38% of whistleblowers experienced professional retaliation in some form, including wrongful termination.{{Citation needed|reason=previous citation of "Miceli, M. P., Near, J. P., & Dworkin, T. M. (2009). Journal of Business Ethics." didn't clearly indicate a source that supports the claim.|date=January 2017}} For example, in the United States, most whistleblower protection laws provide for limited "make whole" remedies or damages for employment losses if whistleblower retaliation is proven. However, many whistleblowers report there exists a widespread "[[Shooting the messenger|shoot the messenger]]" mentality by corporations or government agencies accused of misconduct and in some cases whistleblowers have been subjected to criminal prosecution in reprisal for reporting wrongdoing.

As a reaction to this many private organizations have formed whistleblower [[legal defense fund]]s or support groups to assist whistleblowers; three such examples are the ''National Whistleblowers Center''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.whistleblowers.org/ |title=whistleblowers.org |publisher=whistleblowers.org |access-date=2012-07-08}}</ref> in the [[United States]], and ''Whistleblowers UK''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wbuk.org/ |title=wbuk.org |publisher=wbuk.org |access-date=2017-01-30}}</ref> and ''[[Public Concern at Work]] (PCaW)''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pcaw.co.uk |title=pcaw.co.uk |publisher=pcaw.co.uk |access-date=2012-07-08}}</ref> in the [[United Kingdom]]. Depending on the circumstances, it is not uncommon for whistleblowers to be ostracized by their co-workers, discriminated against by future potential employers, or even fired from their organization. This campaign directed at whistleblowers with the goal of eliminating them from the organization is referred to as [[mobbing]]. It is an extreme form of [[workplace bullying]] wherein the group is set against the targeted individual.<ref>Matthiesen SB, Bjorkelo B, Burke RJ "Workplace Bullying as the Dark Side of Whistleblowing" in Bullying and Harassment in the Workplace: Developments in Theory, Research, and Practice (2012)</ref>

===Psychological impact===
There is limited research on the psychological impacts of whistle blowing. However, poor experiences of whistleblowing can cause a prolonged and prominent assault upon staff well being. As workers attempt to address concerns, they are often met with a wall of silence and hostility by management.<ref>Drew D (29 January 2015) [https://www.theguardian.com/healthcare-network/2015/jan/29/francis-review-nhs-whistleblower-report Francis NHS whistleblower report: a new beginning?] The Guardian</ref> Some whistleblowers speak of overwhelming and persistent distress, drug and alcohol problems, [[paranoid]] behaviour at work, acute [[anxiety (mood)|anxiety]], [[nightmares]], [[Flashback (psychology)|flashbacks]] and [[intrusive thoughts]].<ref name="Peters">{{Cite journal |pmid = 21627700|year = 2011|last1 = Peters|first1 = K.|title = The emotional sequelae of whistleblowing: Findings from a qualitative study|journal = Journal of Clinical Nursing|volume = 20|issue = 19–20|pages = 2907–14|last2 = Luck|first2 = L.|last3 = Hutchinson|first3 = M.|last4 = Wilkes|first4 = L.|last5 = Andrew|first5 = S.|last6 = Jackson|first6 = D.|doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2702.2011.03718.x|url = https://epubs.scu.edu.au/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2143&context=hahs_pubs}}</ref> Depression is often reported by whistleblowers, and [[suicidal thoughts]] may occur in up to about 10%.<ref>Farnsworth CH (22 February 1987) [https://www.nytimes.com/1987/02/22/us/survey-of-whistle-blowers-finds-retaliation-but-few-regrets.html Survey of Whistleblowers finds retaliation, but few regrets] The New York Times</ref><ref name="Lennane">{{Cite journal |pmc = 1678979|year = 1993|last1 = Lennane|first1 = K.

===Ethics===
The definition of [[ethics]] is the [[moral]] [[principles]] that govern a person's or group's behavior. The ethical implications of whistleblowing can be negative as well as positive. Some have argued that public sector whistleblowing plays an important role in the democratic process by resolving [[Principal–agent problem|principle agent problems]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Coyne|first=Christopher J.|last2=Goodman|first2=Nathan|last3=Hall|first3=Abigail R.|date=2018-12-22|title=Sounding the Alarm: The Political Economy of Whistleblowing in the US Security State|url=https://www.degruyter.com/view/journals/peps/25/1/article-20180024.xml|journal=Peace Economics, Peace Science and Public Policy|language=en|volume=25|issue=1|doi=10.1515/peps-2018-0024}}</ref> However, sometimes employees may blow the whistle as an act of revenge. [[Rosemary O'Leary]] explains this in her short volume on a topic called [[guerrilla]] government. "Rather than acting openly, guerrillas often choose to remain "in the closet", moving clandestinely behind the scenes, salmon swimming upstream against the current of power. Over the years, I have learned that the motivations driving guerrillas are diverse. The reasons for acting range from the [[altruistic]] (doing the right thing) to the seemingly petty (I was passed over for that promotion). Taken as a whole, their acts are as awe inspiring as saving human lives out of a love of humanity and as trifling as slowing the issuance of a report out of spite or anger."<ref>{{Cite book|title = The Ethics of Dissent: Managing Guerrilla Government|last = O'Leary|first = Rosemary|publisher = CQ|year = 2006|location = Washington D.C.}}</ref> For example, of the more than 1,000 whistleblower complaints that are filed each year with the Pentagon's Inspector General, about 97 percent are not substantiated.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/checkpoint/wp/2016/04/25/commander-of-bin-laden-raid-blasts-senate-for-disrespecting-military-leaders/|title=Commander of bin Laden raid blasts Senate for disrespecting military leaders|website=Washington Post}}</ref> It is believed throughout the professional world that an individual is bound to secrecy within their work sector. Discussions of whistleblowing and employee loyalty usually assume that the concept of loyalty is irrelevant to the issue or, more commonly, that whistleblowing involves a moral choice that pits the loyalty that an employee owes an employer against the employee's responsibility to serve the public interest.<ref name=":1">{{Cite journal | doi=10.1007/BF00872319 | title=Whistleblowing and employee loyalty| journal=Journal of Business Ethics| volume=11| issue=2| pages=125–128| year=1992| last1=Larmer| first1=Robert A.|jstor=25072254|hdl=10822/853647| s2cid=145249571}}</ref> Robert A. Larmer describes the standard view of whistleblowing in the [[Journal of Business Ethics]] by explaining that an employee possesses [[prima facie]] (based on the first impression; accepted as correct until proved otherwise) duties of loyalty and confidentiality to their employers and that whistleblowing cannot be justified except on the basis of a higher duty to the [[Public benefit|public good]].<ref name=":1" /> It is important to recognize that in any relationship which demands loyalty the relationship works both ways and involves mutual enrichment.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Whistleblowing and Employee Loyalty|last = Duska|first = Ronald|date = Feb 1992|journal = Journal of Business Ethics|url=https://philosophia.uncg.edu/media/phi361-metivier/readings/Duska-Whistle-Blowing%20and%20Loyalty.pdf}}</ref>{{fcn|date=January 2020}}

The ethics of Edward Snowden's actions have been widely discussed and debated in news media and academia worldwide.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Friedman |first=Mark |date=2015 |title=Edward Snowden: Hero or Traitor?

Discussions on whistleblowing generally revolve around three topics: attempts to define whistleblowing more precisely, debates about whether and when whistleblowing is permissible, and debates about whether and when one has an obligation to blow the whistle.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Issues in Business Ethics|publisher = Springer|year = 2007|pages = 139–147}}</ref>{{fcn|date=January 2020}}

===Motivations===
Many whistleblowers have stated that they were motivated to take action to put an end to unethical practices, after witnessing injustices in their businesses or organizations.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.1037/pro0000038 | title=Using scholarship on whistleblowing to inform peer ethics reporting| journal=Professional Psychology: Research and Practice| volume=46| issue=4| pages=298–305| year=2015| last1=Rice| first1=Alexander J.}}</ref> A 2009 study found that whistleblowers are often motivated to take action when they notice a sharp decline in ethical practices, as opposed to a gradual worsening.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.1016/j.jesp.2009.03.013 |title = When misconduct goes unnoticed: The acceptability of gradual erosion in others' unethical behavior|journal = Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|volume = 45|issue = 4|pages = 708–719|year = 2009|last1 = Gino|first1 = Francesca|last2 = Bazerman|first2 = Max H.}}</ref> There are generally two metrics by which whistleblowers determine if a practice is unethical. The first metric involves a violation of the organization's bylaws or written ethical policies. These violations allow individuals to concretize and rationalize blowing the whistle.<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1007/s10551-010-0591-1|title = From Inaction to External Whistleblowing: The Influence of the Ethical Culture of Organizations on Employee Responses to Observed Wrongdoing|journal = Journal of Business Ethics|volume = 98|issue = 3|pages = 513–530|year = 2011|last1 = Kaptein|first1 = Muel|url = http://repub.eur.nl/pub/16600|hdl = 1765/16600|s2cid = 55253548|hdl-access = free}}</ref> On the other hand, "value-driven" whistleblowers are influenced by their personal codes of ethics.

In addition to ethics, social and organizational pressure are a motivating forces. A 2012 study identified that individuals are more likely to blow the whistle when several others know about the wrongdoing, because they would otherwise fear consequences for keeping silent.<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1007/s10551-011-0990-y|title = The Effects of Contextual and Wrongdoing Attributes on Organizational Employees' Whistleblowing Intentions Following Fraud|journal = Journal of Business Ethics|volume = 106|issue = 2|pages = 213–227|year = 2012|last1 = Robinson|first1 = Shani N.|last2 = Robertson|first2 = Jesse C.|last3 = Curtis|first3 = Mary B.|s2cid = 153653821|url=https://www.academia.edu/29417100}}</ref> In cases when one person is causing an injustice, the individual who notices the injustice may file a formal report, rather than confronting the wrongdoer, because confrontation would be more emotionally and psychologically stressful.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.1177/0275074010375298| title=Managing Conflicting Public Values: Governing with Integrity and Effectiveness| journal=The American Review of Public Administration| volume=40| issue=6| pages=623–630| year=2010| last1=De Graaf| first1=Gjalt| last2=Van Der Wal| first2=Zeger| url=https://research.vu.nl/en/publications/1fc1472e-64b5-45d7-b5db-fda8dd763d6c}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1080/00909880009365579|title = Peer reporting of coworker wrongdoing: A qualitative analysis of observer attitudes in the decision to report versus not report unethical behavior|journal = Journal of Applied Communication Research|volume = 28|issue = 4|pages = 309–329|year = 2000|last1 = King|first1 = Granville|last2 = Hermodson|first2 = Amy|s2cid = 145715363}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 256472|last1 = Trevino|first1 = Linda Klebe|title = Peer Reporting of Unethical Behavior: A Social Context Perspective|journal = The Academy of Management Journal|volume = 35|issue = 1|pages = 38–64|last2 = Victor|first2 = Bart|year = 1992}}</ref> Furthermore, individuals may be motivated to report unethical behavior when they believe their organizations will support them.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 30040692|last1 = Gundlach|first1 = Michael J.|title = The Decision to Blow the Whistle: A Social Information Processing Framework|journal = The Academy of Management Review|volume = 28|issue = 1|pages = 107–123|last2 = Douglas|first2 = Scott C.|last3 = Martinko|first3 = Mark J.|year = 2003|doi = 10.5465/amr.2003.8925239}}</ref> Professionals in management roles may feel responsibility to blow the whistle in order to uphold the values and rules of their organizations.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.1108/13639511311302461 |title = Why police officers and labour inspectors (do not) blow the whistle|journal = Policing: An International Journal of Police Strategies & Management|volume = 36|pages = 27–50|year = 2013|last1 = Loyens|first1 = Kim}}</ref>

==Legal protection for whistleblowers==
Legal protection for whistleblowers varies from country to country and may depend on the country of the original activity, where and how secrets were revealed, and how they eventually became published or publicized. Over a dozen countries have now adopted comprehensive whistleblower protection laws that create mechanisms for reporting wrongdoing and provide legal protections to whistleblowers. Over 50 countries have adopted more limited protections as part of their anti-corruption, freedom of information, or employment laws.<ref>Banisar, "Whistleblowing: International Standards and Developments", in CORRUPTION AND TRANSPARENCY: DEBATING THE FRONTIERS BETWEEN STATE, MARKET AND SOCIETY, I.

===Canada===
The Office of the Public Sector Integrity Commissioner of Canada (PSIC)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.psic-ispc.gc.ca/|title=Office of the Public Sector Integrity Commissioner of Canada|first=Web Experience|last=Toolkit|website=www.psic-ispc.gc.ca}}</ref> provides a safe and confidential mechanism enabling public servants and the general public to disclose wrongdoings committed in the public sector. It also protects from reprisal public servants who have disclosed wrongdoing and those who have cooperated in investigations. The Office's goal is to enhance public confidence in Canada's federal public institutions and in the integrity of public servants.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Government of Canada|first1=PSIC|title=Background, Objectives, Scope|url=http://www.psic.gc.ca/eng/content/background-objectives-scope|publisher=Office of the Public Sector Integrity Commissioner|access-date=16 June 2014}}</ref>

Mandated by the Public Servants Disclosure Protection Act (The Act), PSIC is a permanent and independent Agent of Parliament. The Act, which came into force on April 15, 2007, applies to most of the federal public sector, approximately 400,000 public servants.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Government of Canada|first1=PSIC|title=The Servants Disclosure Protection Act|url=http://www.psic.gc.ca/eng/aboutus/psdpa|publisher=Office of the Public Sector Integrity Commissioner|access-date=16 June 2014|date=2013-09-10}}</ref> This includes government departments and agencies, parent Crown corporations, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and other federal public sector bodies.

Not all disclosures lead to an investigation as the Act sets out the jurisdiction of the Commissioner and gives the option not to investigate under certain circumstances. On the other hand, if PSIC conducts an investigation and finds no wrongdoing was committed, the Commissioner must report his findings to the discloser and to the organization's chief executive. Also, reports of founded wrongdoing are presented before the House of Commons and the Senate in accordance with The Act. As of June 2014, a total of nine reports have been tabled in Parliament.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Government of Canada|first1=PSIC|title=Case Reports|url=http://www.psic-ispc.gc.ca/eng/wrongdoing/casereports|publisher=Office of the Public Sector Integrity Commissioner|access-date=16 June 2014|date=2014-05-27}}</ref>

The Act also established the Public Servants Disclosure Protection Tribunal (PSDPT) to protect public servants by hearing reprisal complaints referred by the Public Sector Integrity Commissioner. The Tribunal can grant remedies in favour of complainants and order disciplinary action against persons who take reprisals.

PSIC's current Commissioner is Mr. Mario Dion. Previously, he has served in various senior roles in the public service, including as Associate Deputy Minister of Justice, Executive Director and Deputy Head of the Office of Indian Residential Schools Resolution of Canada, and as Chair of the National Parole Board.

===European Union===
The [[European Parliament]] approved a "Whistleblower Protection Directive" containing broad [[free speech]] protections for whistleblowers in both the [[public sector|public]] and the [[private sector|private]] sectors, including for [[journalist]]s, in all [[member state of the European Union|member states]] of the [[European Union]]. The Directive prohibits direct or indirect retaliation against employees, current and former, in the public sector and the private sector. The Directive's protections apply to employees, to volunteers, and to those who assist them, including to [[civil society]] organizations and to journalists who report on their evidence. It provides equal rights for whistleblowers in the [[national security]] sector who challenge denial or removal of their [[security clearance]]s. Also, whistleblowers are protected from [[prosecutor|criminal prosecution]] and corporate lawsuits for damages resulting from their whistleblowing, and provides for psychological support for dealing with harassment stress.<ref name="commondreams.org">[[Government Accountability Project]], 21 Nov. 2018, "[https://www.commondreams.org/newswire/2018/11/21/european-parliament-panel-approves-whistleblower-protections-all-eu-countries European Parliament Panel Approves Whistleblower Protections for all EU Countries]"</ref>

[[Good government]] observers have hailed the EU directive as setting "the global standard for [[best practice]] rights protecting freedom of speech where it counts the most—challenging abuses of power that betray the [[public trust]]," according to the U.S.-based [[Government Accountability Project]]. They have noted, however, that ambiguities remain in the Directive regarding application in some areas, such as "duty speech," that is, when employees report the same information in the course of a job assignment, for example, to a supervisor, instead of whistleblowing as formal [[dissent]]. In fact, duty speech is how the overwhelming majority of whistleblowing information gets communicated, and where the free flow of information is needed for proper functioning of organizations. However it is in response to such "duty speech" employee communication that the vast majority of retaliation against employees occurs. These observers have noted that the Directive must be understood as applying to protection against retaliation for such duty speech because without such an understanding the Directive will "miss the iceberg of what's needed".<ref name="commondreams.org"/>

Article 321a<sup>ter</sup> introduces an obligation on employees to report irregularities to their employer before reporting to an authority. An employee will, however, not breach his duty of good faith if he reports an irregularity to an authority and
* a period set by the employer and no longer than 60 days has lapsed since the employee has reported the incident to his employer, and
* the employer has not addressed the irregularity or it is obvious that the employer has insufficiently addressed the irregularity.
Article 321a<sup>quarter</sup> provides that an employee may exceptionally directly report to an authority. Exceptions apply in cases
* where the employee is in a position to objectively demonstrate that a report to his employer will prove ineffective,
* where the employee has to anticipate dismissal,
* where the employee must assume that the competent authority will be hindered in investigating the irregularity, or
* where there is a direct and serious hazard to life, to health, to safety, or to the environment.
The draft does not improve on protection against dismissal for employees who report irregularities to their employer.<ref>{{cite web|title=Botschaft über die Teilrevision des Obligationenrechts |url=http://www.admin.ch/opc/de/federal-gazette/2013/9513.pdf|access-date=23 October 2014}}</ref> The amendment does not provide for employees [[Anonymity|anonymously]] filing their observations of irregularities.

Whistleblowing in the United Kingdom is protected by the [[Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998]] (PIDA). Amongst other things, under the Act protected disclosures are permitted even if a [[non-disclosure agreement]] has been signed between the employer and the former or current employee; a consultation on further restricting confidentiality clauses was held in 2019.<ref name=consult>{{Cite web|url=https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/783011/confidentiality-clauses-consultation.pdf|title=Consultation on Confidentiality Clauses|website=UK [[Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy]]|date=March 2019}}</ref>

The [[Freedom to Speak Up Review]] set out 20 principles to bring about improvements to help whistleblowers in the [[National Health Service|NHS]], including:
* Culture of raising concerns&nbsp;– to make raising issues a part of normal routine business of a well-led NHS organization.
* Culture free from bullying&nbsp;– freedom of staff to speak out relies on staff being able to work in a culture which is free from bullying.
* Training&nbsp;– every member of staff should receive training in their trust's approach to raising concerns and in receiving and acting on them.
* Support&nbsp;– all NHS trusts should ensure there is a dedicated person to whom concerns can be easily reported and without formality, a "speak up guardian" .
* Support to find alternative employment in the NHS&nbsp;– where a worker who has raised a concern cannot, as a result, continue their role, the NHS should help them seek an alternative job.

[[Monitor (NHS)|Monitor]] produced a whistleblowing policy in November 2015 that all NHS organizations in England are obliged to follow. It explicitly says that anyone bullying or acting against a whistleblower could be potentially liable to disciplinary action.<ref>{{cite news|title=Monitor to reveal national whistleblowing policy|url=http://www.hsj.co.uk/topics/workforce/exclusive-monitor-to-reveal-national-whistleblowing-policy/7000188.article|access-date=18 December 2015|publisher=Health Service Journal|date=16 November 2015}}</ref>

===United States===

{{main|Whistleblower protection in the United States}}
Whistleblowing tradition in what would soon become the United States had a start in 1773 with [[Benjamin Franklin]] leaking a few letters in the [[Hutchinson Letters Affair|Hutchinson affair]]. The release of the communications from royal governor [[Thomas Hutchinson (governor)|Thomas Hutchinson]] to [[Thomas Whately]] led to a firing, a duel and arguably, both through the many general impacts of the leak and its role in convincing Franklin to join the radicals' cause, the taking of another important final step toward the [[American Revolution]].

The first act of the [[Continental Congress]] in favor of what later came to be called whistleblowing came in the [[Esek Hopkins#Revolutionary War service|1777-8 case]] of [[Samuel Shaw (naval officer)|Samuel Shaw]] and [[Richard Marven]]. The two seamen accused Commander in Chief of the [[Continental Navy]] [[Esek Hopkins]] of torturing British prisoners of war. The Congress dismissed Hopkins and then agreed to cover the defense cost of the pair after Hopkins filed a libel suit against them under which they were imprisoned. Shaw and Marven were subsequently cleared in a jury trial.

To be considered a whistleblower in the [[United States]], most federal whistleblower statutes require that [[federal employee]]s have reason to believe their employer violated some law, rule, or regulation; testify or commence a legal proceeding on the legally protected matter; or refuse to violate the law.

In cases where whistleblowing on a specified topic is protected by statute, U.S. courts have generally held that such whistleblowers are protected from retaliation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oalj.dol.gov/PUBLIC/WHISTLEBLOWER/REFERENCES/REFERENCE_WORKS/EDIG12.HTM |title=DOL.gov |publisher=Oalj.dol.gov |access-date=2012-07-08}}</ref> However, a closely divided [[U.S. Supreme Court]] decision, ''[[Garcetti v. Ceballos]]'' (2006) held that the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] [[free speech]] guarantees for government employees do not protect disclosures made within the scope of the employees' duties.

In the United States, legal protections vary according to the subject matter of the whistleblowing, and sometimes the state where the case arises.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.peer.org/state/index.php |title=Peer.org |publisher=Peer.org |access-date=2012-07-08}}</ref> In passing the 2002 [[Sarbanes–Oxley Act]], the Senate Judiciary Committee found that whistleblower protections were dependent on the "patchwork and vagaries" of varying state statutes.<ref>Congressional Record p. S7412; S. Rep. No. 107–146, 107th Cong., 2d Session 19 (2002).</ref> Still, a wide variety of federal and state laws protect employees who call attention to violations, help with enforcement proceedings, or refuse to obey unlawful directions. While this patchwork approach has often been criticized, it also responsible for the United States having more dedicated whistleblowing laws than any other country.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Transatlantic Whistleblowing.|last = Gerdemann|first = Simon|publisher = Mohr Siebeck|year = 2018|isbn = 978-3-16-155917-4}}</ref>

The first US law adopted specifically to protect whistleblowers was the 1863 United States [[False Claims Act]] (revised in 1986), which tried to combat fraud by suppliers of the United States government during the [[American Civil War]]. The Act encourages whistleblowers by promising them a percentage of the money recovered by the government and by protecting them from employment retaliation.<ref name="answers1">{{cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/whistleblower |title=Answers.com |publisher=Answers.com |access-date=2012-07-08}}</ref>

Another US law that specifically protects whistleblowers is the [[Lloyd–La Follette Act]] of 1912. It guaranteed the right of federal employees to furnish information to the [[United States Congress]]. The first US environmental law to include an employee protection was the [[Clean Water Act]] of 1972. Similar protections were included in subsequent federal environmental laws, including the [[Safe Drinking Water Act]] (1974), [[Resource Conservation and Recovery Act]] (1976), [[Toxic Substances Control Act of 1976]], [[Energy Reorganization Act of 1974]] (through 1978 amendment to protect nuclear whistleblowers), [[Superfund|Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA, or the Superfund Law)]] (1980), and the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]] (1990). Similar employee protections enforced through OSHA are included in the [[Surface Transportation Assistance Act]] (1982) to protect truck drivers, the [https://www.whistleblowers.gov/statutes/psia Pipeline Safety Improvement Act] (PSIA) of 2002, the [[Wendell H. Ford Aviation Investment and Reform Act for the 21st Century]] ("AIR 21"), and the [[Sarbanes–Oxley Act]], enacted on July 30, 2002 (for corporate fraud whistleblowers). More recent laws with some whistleblower protection include the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] ("ACA", the [[Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act]] ("CPSIA"), the [https://www.whistleblowers.gov/statutes/spa Seamans Protection Act as amended by the Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2010] ("SPA"), the [[Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act|Consumer Financial Protection Act]] ("CFPA"), the [[FDA Food Safety Modernization Act]] ("FSMA"), the [[Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act]] ("MAP-21"), and the [[Taxpayer First Act]] ("TFA").

Investigation of retaliation against whistleblowers under 23 federal statutes falls under the jurisdiction of [https://www.whistleblowers.gov/ Directorate of Whistleblower Protection Program]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.whistleblowers.gov |title=Whistleblowers.gov |publisher=Whistleblowers.gov |access-date=2012-07-08}}</ref> of the [[United States Department of Labor|United States Department of Labor's]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dol.gov |title=DOL.gov |publisher=DOL.gov |access-date=2012-07-08}}</ref> [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (OSHA).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.osha.gov |title=Osha.gov |publisher=Osha.gov |date=2012-04-28 |access-date=2012-07-08}}</ref> New whistleblower statutes enacted by Congress, which are to be enforced by the Secretary of Labor, are generally delegated by a Secretary's Order<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=FEDERAL_REGISTER&p_id=21749 |title=Osha.gov |publisher=Osha.gov |access-date=2012-07-08}}</ref> to OSHA's Directorate of Whistleblower Protection Program (DWPP).

The patchwork of laws means that victims of retaliation need to be aware of the laws at issue to determine the deadlines and means for making proper complaints. Some deadlines are as short as 10 days (Arizona State Employees have 10 days to file a "Prohibited Personnel Practice" Complaint before the Arizona State Personnel Board), while others are up to 300 days.

Those who report a false claim against the federal government, and suffer adverse employment actions as a result, may have up to six years (depending on state law) to file a civil suit for remedies under the US [[False Claims Act]] (FCA).<ref>{{usc|31|3730}} (h)</ref> Under a ''[[qui tam]]'' provision, the "original source" for the report may be entitled to a percentage of what the government recovers from the offenders. However, the "original source" must also be the first to file a federal civil complaint for recovery of the federal funds fraudulently obtained, and must avoid publicizing the claim of fraud until the [[United States Department of Justice|US Justice Department]] decides whether to prosecute the claim itself. Such ''qui tam'' lawsuits must be filed under seal, using special procedures to keep the claim from becoming public until the federal government makes its decision on direct prosecution.

The federally recognized [[National Whistleblower Appreciation Day]] is observed annually on July 30, on the anniversary of the country's original 1778 whistleblower protection law.

===Other countries===
There are comprehensive laws in [[New Zealand]] and [[South Africa]]. A number of other countries have recently{{when?|date=January 2020}} adopted comprehensive whistleblower laws including [[Ghana]], [[South Korea]], and [[Uganda]]. They are also being considered in [[Kenya]] and [[Rwanda]]. The [[European Court of Human Rights]] ruled in 2008 that whistleblowing was protected as freedom of expression. And in February 2017, [[Nigeria]] also set up the whistleblowing policy against corruption and other ills in the country.<ref>Guja v. Moldova, Application no. 14277/04 (2008)</ref>

==Advocacy for whistleblower rights and protections==
Many [[NGOs]] advocate for stronger and more comprehensive legal rights and protections for whistleblowers. Among them are the [[Government Accountability Project]] (GAP), Blueprint for Free Speech,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://blueprintforfreespeech.net/|title=Blueprint for Free Speech – Meet the whistleblowers|website=blueprintforfreespeech.net}}</ref> [[Public Concern at Work]] (PCaW) and the Open Democracy Advice Centre<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.opendemocracy.org.za/|title=Home|first=Super|last=User|website=www.opendemocracy.org.za}}</ref>

==Modern methods used for whistleblower protection==
Whistleblowers who may be at risk from those they are exposing are now using [[encryption]] methods and anonymous content sharing software to protect their identity. [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor]], a highly accessible anonymity network, is one that is frequently used by whistleblowers around the world.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = https://www.usenix.org/legacy/events/sec11/tech/full_papers/Mittal.pdf|title = PIR-Tor: Scalable Anonymous Communication Using Private Information Retrieval.|last = Mittal|first = Prateek|date = 2001|journal = USENIX Security Symposium|access-date = 10 April 2015}}</ref> Tor has undergone a number of large security updates to protect the identities of potential whistleblowers who may wish to anonymously leak information.<ref>"Security upgrade for 'anonymity network'".

Recently{{when?|date=January 2020}} specialized whistleblowing software like [[SecureDrop]] and [[GlobaLeaks]] has been built on top of the Tor technology in order to incentivize and simplify its adoption for secure whistleblowing.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Frediani|first1=Carola|title=After NSA Scandal, Crop of Whistleblower Communication Tools for Journalists Emerge|url=http://techpresident.com/news/24526/after-NSA-whistleblower-tools-for-journalists|website=[[TechPresident]]|access-date=27 November 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Greenberg|first1=Andy|title=Whistleblowers Beware: Apps Like Whisper and Secret Will Rat You Out|url=https://www.wired.com/2014/05/whistleblowers-beware/|journal=[[Wired (website)|Wired]]|access-date=27 November 2016|date=2014-05-14}}</ref>

===Whistleblowing hotline===
In business, whistleblowing hotlines are usually deployed as a way of mitigating risk, with the intention of providing secure, anonymous reporting for employees or third party suppliers who may otherwise be fearful of reprisals from their employer. As such, implementing a corporate whistleblowing hotline is often seen as a step towards compliance, and can also highlight an organization's stance on ethics.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.acfe.com/uploadedFiles/ACFE_Website/Content/review/diafp/08-Implementing-a-Whistleblower-Helpline.pdf|title=Developing an Integrated Anti-Fraud, Compliance, and Ethics Program - Implementing a Whistleblowing Helpline|date=2019|website=Association of Certified Fraud Examiners}}</ref> It is widely agreed that implementing a dedicated service for whistleblowers has a positive effect on an [[organizational culture]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ethicalcorp.com/content/how-cultivate-whistleblowing-culture|title=How to cultivate a whistleblowing culture {{!}} Ethical Corporation|website=www.ethicalcorp.com|access-date=2019-05-10}}</ref>

A whistleblowing hotline is sometimes also referred to as an ''ethics hotline'' or ''<nowiki/>'Speak Up' hotline'' and is often facilitated by an [[Outsourcing|outsourced]] service provider to encourage potential disclosers to come forward.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.expolink.co.uk/whistleblowing-hotline/what-is-a-whistleblowing-hotline/|title=What is a Whistleblowing Hotline (and why are they important)?|website=Expolink|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-05-10}}</ref> Navex Global and [[Expolink]] are examples of global third party whistleblower services.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/riskandcompliance/2018/05/29/whistleblowing-hotlines-a-gray-area-under-eus-new-privacy-law/|title=Whistleblowing Hotlines: A Gray Area Under EU's New Privacy Law|last=Cutter|first=Henry|date=2018-05-29|website=WSJ|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-14}}</ref>

In 2018, the ''[[Harvard Business Review]]'' published findings to support the idea that whistleblowing hotlines are crucial to keeping companies healthy, stating "More whistles blown are a sign of health, not illness."<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://hbr.org/2018/11/research-whistleblowers-are-a-sign-of-healthy-companies|title=Research: Whistleblowers Are a Sign of Healthy Companies|last1=Stubben|first1=Stephen|date=2018-11-14|work=Harvard Business Review|access-date=2019-05-14|last2=Welch|first2=Kyle|issn=0017-8012}}</ref>

==In popular culture==
One of the subplots for season{{nbsp}}6 of the popular American TV show ''The Office'' focused on Andy Bernard, a salesman, discovering the printers of his company catch on fire, struggling with how to deal with the news, and the company's response to the whistleblower going public.

In 2014, the rock/industrial band [[Laibach]] in is eighth studio album [[Spectre (Laibach album)]] released a song titled "The Whistleblowers" . It was released on March 3, 2014 under Mute Records. 

In 2016, the rock band [[Thrice]] released a song titled "Whistleblower" off of the album ''[[To Be Everywhere Is to Be Nowhere]]''. The song is written from the perspective of Snowden.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Montemarano|first1=Mike|url=http://www.baeblemusic.com/musicblog/4-25-2016/blood-on-the-sand-a-conversation-with-thrice.html |title='Blood on the Sand:' A Conversation With Thrice |publisher=Baeble Music |access-date=April 25, 2016}}</ref>

In July 2018, [[CBS]] debuted a new reality television show entitled ''[[Whistleblower (U.S. TV program)|Whistleblower]]'', hosted by lawyer, former judge and police officer [[Alex Ferrer]] which covers ''[[qui tam]]'' suits under the [[False Claims Act]] against companies that have allegedly defrauded the federal government.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2018/07/17/plaintiffs-lawyers-get-tv-time-as-cbs-launches-whistleblower-reality-show/?slreturn=20180618111845|title=Plaintiffs Lawyers Get TV Time as CBS Launches Whistleblower Reality Show {{!}} The American Lawyer|work=The American Lawyer|access-date=2018-07-18|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180718205236/https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2018/07/17/plaintiffs-lawyers-get-tv-time-as-cbs-launches-whistleblower-reality-show/?slreturn=20180618111845|archive-date=2018-07-18}}</ref>
