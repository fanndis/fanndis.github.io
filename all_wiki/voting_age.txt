{{short description|Minimum age of eligible voters}}
{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2020}}

A '''voting age''' is a [[age of majority|minimum age]] established by law that a person must attain before they become eligible to [[suffrage|vote in a public election]]. As of the present day, the most common voting age is 18 years; however, voting ages as low as 16 and as high as 25 currently exist (see list below). Most countries have set a minimum voting age, often set in their constitution. In a number of countries [[compulsory voting|voting is compulsory]] for those eligible to vote, while in most it is optional.

When the [[suffrage|right to vote]] was being established in [[democracy|democracies]], the voting age was generally set at 21 or higher. In the 1970s many countries reduced the voting age to 18. The debate is ongoing in a number of countries on proposals to reduce the voting age to or below 18.

Prior to [[World War II|the Second World War]] of 1939–1945, the voting age in almost all countries was 21 years or higher. In 1946 Czechoslovakia became the first state to reduce the voting age to 20 years, and by 1968 a total of 17 countries had lowered their voting age.<ref>[http://aomol.net/000001/000138/html/am138--51.html ''"Lowering the Minimum Voting Age to 18 Years - Pro and Con Arguments"''], Constitutional Revision Study Documents of the [[Maryland]] Constitutional Convention Commission, 1968.

By the end of the 20th century, 18 had become by far the most common voting age. However, a few countries maintain a voting age of 20 years or higher, and a few countries have a lower voting age of 16 or 17.<ref>{{cite web |title=Comparative data |url=http://aceproject.org/epic-en/CDTable?view=country&question=VR001 |website=ACE - The Electoral Knowledge Network |access-date=5 August 2019}}</ref> It was argued that if young men could be drafted to go to war at 18, they should be able to vote at the age of 18.<ref>{{cite book|last= Sanders|first= Mark|title= Your Right To Vote|date= 2000|publisher= Raintree Steck- Vaugh company|location= United States}}</ref>{{qn|date=November 2018}}

==Debate on lowering the voting age to 16==
[[File:NYRA Berkeley voting age protest.jpg|thumb|right|Demonstration in favor of lowering the voting age by members of [[National Youth Rights Association|NYRA]] [[Berkeley, California]] (2004)]]
Around 2000, a number of countries began to consider whether the voting age ought to be reduced further, with arguments most often being made in favour of a reduction to 16. The earliest moves came during the 1990s, when the voting age for [[municipal elections]] in some [[States of Germany]] was lowered to 16. [[Lower Saxony]] was the first state to make such a reduction, in 1995, and four other states did likewise.<ref name="16 locals"/>

Criticism of the proposal includes claims that youngsters are too much under the influence of parents, teachers and peers to make an independent and informed decision.<ref>{{cite web

''Young Citizens''. Retrieved 21 July 2018.</ref>

Others have argued that instead of lowering the voting age to 16, people under 18 generally don't, or shouldn't pay taxes, and a better solution is for those that don't pay income taxes also not have the right to vote.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://blogs.spectator.co.uk/2013/09/16-years-old-shouldnt-be-able-to-vote-they-arent-ready/|title=Take it from a teenager: 16-year olds shouldn't be able to vote|date=2013-09-27|website=Coffee House|language=en-US}}</ref>

During the 2000s several proposals for a reduced voting age were put forward in [[U.S. states]], including [[California]], [[Florida]] and [[Alaska]],<ref>[http://youthrights.org/votestatus.php Worldwide Efforts to Lower the Voting Age], National Youth Rights Association</ref> but none were successful. In Oregon, Senate Joint Resolution 22 has been introduced to reduce the voting age from 18 to 16.

Men in military service who turned 19 during the first world war were entitled to vote in 1918 irrespective of their age as part of the ''[[Representation of the People Act 1918]]'' which also allowed some women over the age of 30 to vote.

YouGov poll research from 2018 shows that whilst the public are still opposed, there is growing support for extending the franchise. As of May 2019, all the main parties, with the exception of the Conservatives, back reducing the age to 16. Some have argued the Conservatives are hypocritical not to support this, as they allow 16-year olds to vote in their leadership elections. It is also argued that all the main parties' approach is self-serving as younger voters are thought more likely to support left leaning parties and remaining in the EU, and less likely to support right leaning parties, and leaving the EU.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/should-the-voting-age-be-lowered-to-16-a8882731.html|title=Should the voting age be lowered to 16?|date=23 May 2019|website=The Independent}}</ref>
