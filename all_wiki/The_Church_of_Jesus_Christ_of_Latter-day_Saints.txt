==History==

{{Main|History of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints}}
The history of the LDS Church is typically divided into three broad time periods: (1) the early history during the lifetime of [[Joseph Smith]], which is in common with all churches associated with the Latter Day Saint movement (2) a pioneer era under the leadership of [[Brigham Young]] and his 19th-century successors; and (3) a modern era beginning around the turn of the 20th century as [[Utah]] achieved statehood.

The LDS Church, originally called the [[Church of Christ (Latter Day Saints)|Church of Christ]], was formally organized by [[Joseph Smith]] on April 6, 1830, in [[burned-over district|western New York]].<ref>Scholars and eyewitnesses disagree whether the church was organized in [[Manchester (town), New York|Manchester, New York]] at the Smith log home, or in [[Fayette, New York|Fayette]] at the home of [[Peter Whitmer]]. {{Harvnb|Bushman|2005|p=109}}; {{Harvnb|Marquardt|2005|pp=223–23}} (arguing that organization in Manchester is most consistent with eye-witness statements).

At Young's death in 1877, he was followed by other church presidents, who resisted efforts by the [[United States Congress]] to outlaw Mormon polygamous marriages. In 1878, the United States Supreme Court, in ''[[Reynolds v. United States]]'', decreed that "religious duty" to engage in plural marriage was not a valid defense to prosecutions for violating state laws against polygamy. Conflict between Mormons and the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. government]] escalated to the point that, in 1890, Congress disincorporated the LDS Church and seized most of its assets. Soon thereafter, church president [[Wilford Woodruff]] issued a [[1890 Manifesto|manifesto]] that officially suspended the practice.<ref>{{lds|Official Declaration —|od|1}}</ref> Although this manifesto did not dissolve existing plural marriages, so that families would not be split apart, no new polygamous marriages would be performed. Relations with the United States markedly improved after 1890, such that Utah was admitted as a U.S. state in 1896. Relations further improved after 1904, when church president [[Joseph F. Smith]] again [[Reed Smoot hearings|disavowed polygamy]] before the [[United States Congress]] and issued a "[[Second Manifesto]]", calling for all plural marriages in the church to cease, as they were already against church doctrine since Woodruff issued the Manifesto. Eventually, the church adopted a policy of [[excommunication|excommunicating]] its members found practicing polygamy and today actively distances itself from "[[Mormon fundamentalism|fundamentalist]]" groups still practicing polygamy.<ref>{{citation |quote= If any of our members are found to be practicing plural marriage, they are excommunicated, the most serious penalty the Church can impose.

A number of official changes have taken place to the organization during the modern era.

For example, since the early 1900s, the church has instituted a [[Priesthood Correlation Program]] to centralize church operations and bring them under a hierarchy of priesthood leaders. During the [[Great Depression]], the church also began operating a church welfare system, and it has conducted numerous humanitarian efforts in cooperation with other religious organizations including [[Catholic Relief Services]] and [[Islamic Relief]], as well as secular organizations such as the [[American Red Cross]].

==Teachings and practices==

===Authorized texts===
[[File:Latter-day Saint Scripture Quadruple Combination.jpg|upright=.6|thumb|The written canon of the LDS Church is referred to as its ''[[standard works]]''.]]
The theology of the LDS Church consists of a combination of biblical doctrines with modern revelations and other commentary by LDS leaders, particularly Joseph Smith. The most authoritative sources of theology are the faith's canon of four religious texts, called the "[[standard works]]". Included in the standard works are the [[Bible]], the [[Book of Mormon]], the [[Doctrine and Covenants]], and the [[Pearl of Great Price (Mormonism)|Pearl of Great Price]]. The Book of Mormon is said by the church to be "Another Testament of Jesus Christ" that Smith translated from buried [[golden plates]]. The LDS Church believes that the [[Angel Moroni]] told Smith about these golden plates and guided him to find them buried in the [[Hill Cumorah]]. The church believes that this Angel Moroni is at least partial fulfillment of Revelation 14:6 in the Bible. The church characterizes the Book of Mormon as "the most correct of any book on earth and the keystone of [the] religion".<ref>{{citation |title= History of the Church |volume= 4 |page= 461|title-link= History of the Church (Joseph Smith) }}</ref>

The Bible, also part of the church's canon, is believed to be "the word of God as far as it is translated correctly".<ref>{{lds|Articles of Faith|a_of_f|1|8}}: "We believe the Bible to be the word of God as far as it is translated correctly."</ref> Most often, the church uses the [[Authorized King James Version]]. Sometimes, however, parts of the [[Joseph Smith Translation of the Bible]] (corrections and restorations of assertedly damaged or lost passages) are considered authoritative. Some excerpts of Smith's translation have been included in the Pearl of Great Price, which also includes further translations by Smith and church historical items. Other historical items and revelations are found in the Doctrine and Covenants.

Another source of authoritative doctrine is the pronouncements of the current Apostles and members of the [[First Presidency (LDS Church)|First Presidency]]. The church teaches that the First Presidency (the church's president and his counselors) and the Quorum of Twelve Apostles are prophets<ref name="oct12_conference">{{Citation |title= The Sustaining of Church Officers |first= Henry B. |last= Eyring |author-link= Henry B. Eyring |journal= Ensign |date= November 2012 |url= http://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/ensign/2012/11/the-sustaining-of-church-officers |quote= It is proposed that we sustain the counselors in the First Presidency and the Twelve Apostles as prophets, seers, and revelators.}} For past sustainings, see also: [//www.churchofjesuschrist.org/search?query=sustaining+of+church+officers Search - "The Sustaining of Church Officers"].</ref> and that their teachings are generally given under inspiration from God through the [[Holy Spirit]]. Members of the church [[Common consent (Latter Day Saints)|acknowledge (sustain)]] them regularly as [[prophet, seer, and revelator|prophets, seers, and revelators]]—this is done publicly twice a year at the church's worldwide [[general conference (LDS Church)|general conference]].<ref name="oct12_conference"/>

===Distinctive doctrines and practices===
{{Main|Beliefs and practices of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints}}
[[File:Phil and Marlene.jpg|thumb|upright|A couple after their [[Celestial marriage|marriage]] in the [[Manti Utah Temple]]]]
Several doctrines and practices of the LDS Church are peculiar within Christianity. For example, the [[Mormon cosmology]] and [[Plan of salvation (Latter Day Saints)|plan of salvation]] include the doctrines of a [[pre-mortal life]], [[Degrees of Glory|three degrees of heaven]], and [[Exaltation (Latter Day Saints)|exaltation]]. According to these doctrines, every human spirit is a spiritual child of a [[God the Father|Heavenly Father]], and each has the potential to continue to learn, grow, and progress in the eternities, eventually achieving eternal life (which Latter-day Saints view as distinct from [[immortality]]), which is to become one with God in the same way that [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]] is one with the Father, thus allowing the children of God to become divine beings or "gods" themselves.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Bushman|2008|p=74}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=The Divinization of the Christian according to the Greek Fathers|last=Gross|first=Jules|date=2002|publisher=A & C Press|isbn=0736316000|edition= 1st|location=Anaheim, Calif.|translator-last=Onica|translator-first=Paul|oclc=51254902}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|chapter-url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf01.ix.vii.i.html|title=Irenaeus: Against Heresies|last=Irenaeus|year=2001|chapter=Chapter 5, Preface|author-link=Irenaeus}}</ref> This view on the doctrine of [[Divinization (Christian)|theosis]] is also referred to as becoming a "joint-heir with Christ".<ref name="EoM Godhood">{{cite encyclopedia |last= Carter |first= K.

This latter ordinance, known as a [[Sealing (Mormonism)|sealing]] ceremony, reflects a singular LDS view with respect to families. According to LDS Church theology, men and women may be "sealed" to one another so that their marital bond continues into the eternities.<ref>A man may be sealed to more than one wife if his previous wives are either dead or legally divorced from him; a living woman, however, may only be sealed to one husband. See {{Citation | author=LDS Church | title=Church Handbook of Instructions | year=2006 | place=Salt Lake City, Utah | publisher=LDS Church | page=85| title-link=Church Handbook of Instructions }}. Thus, there is a common view within the LDS Church that though prohibited by the LDS Church in mortality, [[plural marriage]] will exist in the afterlife.

All able LDS young men are expected to serve a two-year, full-time proselytizing mission.<ref>In 1974, church president [[Spencer W.

While there is no compulsion for him to do any of these things, he should do them for his own good.}} The church's current president, [[Thomas S.

Prospective male missionaries must be at least 18 years old and no older than 25, not yet married, have completed secondary school, and meet certain criteria for physical fitness and spiritual worthiness. Missionary service is not compulsory, nor is it required for young men to retain their church membership. Unmarried women 19 years and older may also serve as missionaries, generally for a term of 18 months. However, the LDS Church emphasizes that women are not under the same expectation to serve as male members are, and may serve solely as a personal decision.

===Comparisons with Christian denominations outside the Latter Day Saint movement===
{{See also|Mormonism and Christianity}}
The LDS Church shares various teachings with other branches of Christianity. These include a belief in the Bible (subject to an acknowledgement that it is imperfect),<ref>Adherents believe in the Bible "as far as it is translated correctly": see {{lds|Articles of Faith|a_of_f|1|8}}. Additionally, Joseph Smith taught that the [[Song of Songs|Songs of Solomon]] "are not inspired writings".</ref> the divinity of Jesus, and his [[Atonement in Christianity|atonement]] and [[resurrection of Jesus Christ|resurrection]]. LDS theology also includes belief in the doctrine of salvation through Jesus alone, [[Restorationism (Christian primitivism)|restorationism]],<ref>{{lds|Articles of Faith|a_of_f|1|6}}.</ref> [[millennialism]], [[continuationism]], [[penal substitution]],<ref>Book of Mormon, Alma 34:8–16.</ref> and a form of [[apostolic succession]]. The practices of [[baptism#Submersion|baptism by immersion]] and the [[eucharist]] (referred to as ''the [[Sacrament (LDS Church)|sacrament]]'') are also held in common. However, the [[Catholic Church]] considers doctrinal differences between the two groups to be so great that it will not accept a prior LDS baptism as evidence of Christian initiation, as it will baptism by other Christian groups, such as the [[Eastern Orthodox]] and [[Protestant]] churches.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ewtn.com/library/theology/mormbap1.htm|title=The Question of the Validity of Baptism Conferred in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints|author=Fr.

Nevertheless, the LDS Church differs from the many other churches within contemporary Christianity, and many people do not accept the church as part of Christianity.<ref>For example, a 2007 poll conducted by the Pew Research Center found that 31 percent of Americans surveyed do not consider Mormons to be Christian.{{cite web|title=Public Expresses Mixed Views of Islam, Mormonism|url=http://pewforum.org/surveys/religionviews07/|publisher=[[Pew Research Center]]|website=PewForum.org|date=September 25, 2007|access-date=September 13, 2018}}</ref> The faith itself views other modern Christian faiths as having departed from true Christianity via a [[Great Apostasy|general apostasy]] and maintains that it is a restoration of 1st-century Christianity and the only true and authorized Christian church.<ref>{{Citation | last=Smith | first=Joseph, Jr. | author-link=Joseph Smith | title=Church History [Wentworth Letter] | journal=[[Times and Seasons]] | volume=3 | issue=9 | pages=706–10 [707] | date=March 1, 1842a | url=http://www.centerplace.org/history/ts/v3n09.htm#706 | access-date=September 30, 2009 | archive-url=https://archive.today/20120530030104/http://www.centerplace.org/history/ts/v3n09.htm#706 | archive-date=May 30, 2012 | url-status=dead }} (traditional Christian denominations "were believing in incorrect doctrines, and that none of them was acknowledged of God as His church and kingdom"). {{Citation | last=Smith | first=Joseph, Jr. | author-link=Joseph Smith | title=History of Joseph Smith | journal=[[Times and Seasons]] | volume=3 | issue=11 | pages=748–49 | date=April 1, 1842c | url=http://www.centerplace.org/history/ts/v3n11.htm#748 | access-date=September 30, 2009 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091101131953/http://www.centerplace.org/history/ts/v3n11.htm#748 | archive-date=November 1, 2009 | url-status=live }} Stating that Jesus told Smith that all existing Christian creeds "were an abomination in his sight".</ref><ref>D&C 1:30 (LDS Church is the "only true and living church upon the face of the whole earth").</ref> Differences between the LDS Church and most of traditional Christianity include disagreement with aspects of the [[Nicene Creed]], belief in a theory of [[Plan of salvation (Latter Day Saints)|human salvation]] that includes three heavens (referred to as "[[degrees of glory]]", its interpretation of I Cor. 15:35 ''et.seq.''),<ref>{{citation |author-link= Spencer W.

Officially, major Christian denominations view the LDS Church as standing apart from [[creed]]al Christianity.<ref>See, for example, {{Citation|url=http://www.pcusa.org/interfaith/study/lds.htm|title=Presbyterians and Latter-day Saints|access-date=January 30, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100123002240/http://www.pcusa.org/interfaith/study/lds.htm|archive-date=January 23, 2010|url-status=live}} ([[Presbyterian Church USA]], stating that "Mormonism is a new and emerging religious tradition distinct from the historic apostolic tradition of the Christian Church"); {{Citation|url=http://www.elca.org/dcm/worship/faq/baptism/rebaptize.html|title=Should Lutherans Rebaptize Former Mormons Who Are Joining the Congregation?|access-date=August 15, 2006|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060211010129/http://www.elca.org/dcm/worship/faq/baptism/rebaptize.html|archive-date=February 11, 2006}} [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America]], stating that LDS Church doctrine regarding the [[Trinity]] is "substantially different from that of orthodox, creedal Christianity"; {{Citation|url=http://www.gc2000.org/pets/cal/TEXT/c0806.asp|title=General Conference 2000 806-NonDis|access-date=August 15, 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021181623/http://www.gc2000.org/pets/cal/TEXT/c0806.asp|archive-date=October 21, 2013|url-status=live}} ([[United Methodist Church]], stating that the LDS Church, "by self-definition, does not fit within the bounds of the historic, apostolic tradition of Christian faith").</ref> Leaders of the LDS Church assert that the LDS Church is the only true church and that other churches do not have the authority to act in Jesus' name.<ref>According to [[Joseph Smith]], Jesus told him that the other churches claiming to be Christian creeds "were an abomination in the Lords sight; that those professors [of religion] were all corrupt".  ''Pearl of Great Price'', [[Joseph Smith—History]] 1:19.</ref>

From the perspective of Christians who agree with creeds, the most significant area of departure is the rejection by the LDS Church of certain parts of ecumenical creeds such as the Nicene Creed, which defines the predominant view of the Christian God as a [[Trinity]] of three separate persons in "[[Homoousian|one essence]]". LDS Church theology includes the belief in a "[[Godhead (Latter Day Saints)|Godhead]]" composed of God the Father, his son, Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost as three separate Persons who share a unity of purpose or will; however, they are viewed as three distinct Beings making one Godhead. The beliefs of the church also include the belief that God the Father and his son, Jesus Christ, are separate beings with bodies of flesh and blood, while the Holy Ghost lacks such a physical body. Other significant differences relate to the church's acceptance of additional scripture, doctrine, and practices beyond what is found in the Catholic, Protestant, or [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] versions of the Bible.

===Comparison with other Latter Day Saint denominations===
{{See also|List of sects in the Latter Day Saint movement}}
The LDS Church shares a common heritage with a number of smaller faith groups that are collectively called the [[Latter Day Saint movement]]. The largest of these smaller groups is the [[Community of Christ]] (previously known as the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints), based in [[Independence, Missouri]], followed by [[The Church of Jesus Christ (Bickertonite)|The Church of Jesus Christ]], based in [[Monongahela, Pennsylvania]]. Like the LDS Church, these faiths believe in Joseph Smith as a prophet and founder of their religion. They also accept the Book of Mormon, and most, but not all, accept at least some version of the [[Doctrine and Covenants]]. However, they tend to disagree to varying degrees with the LDS Church concerning doctrine and church leadership.

The main branches of the Latter Day Saint movement resulted from the crisis of succession upon the death of Joseph Smith. Other branches may be considered later offshoots of the LDS Church branch, mainly due to disagreements about plural marriage.

Church congregations are organized geographically. Members are generally expected to attend the congregation with their assigned geographical area; however, some geographical areas also provide separate congregations for young single adults (between the ages of 18 and 30), single adults aged 31 to 45,<ref>{{citation |title= Handbook 2: Administering the Church |publisher= The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints |contribution-url= //www.churchofjesuschrist.org/handbook/handbook-2-administering-the-church/single-members |contribution= 16. Single Members|title-link= Handbook (LDS Church) }}</ref> or for speakers of alternate languages. For Sunday services, the church is grouped into either larger (150 to 400 people) congregations known as [[Ward (LDS Church)|wards]], or smaller congregations known as branches. Although the building may sometimes be referred to as a chapel, the room used as a chapel for religious services is only one component of the standard [[meetinghouse]]. The church maintains a virtual tour online of a typical example and also an online meetinghouse locator, which can be used to find the locations and meeting times of its congregations all over the world. Regional church organizations, encompassing multiple congregations, include [[Stake (Latter Day Saints)|stakes]], [[Mission (LDS Church)|missions]], [[District (LDS Church)|districts]], [[Area (LDS Church)|areas]], and regions.

===Priesthood hierarchy===
{{Main|Priesthood (LDS Church)}}
[[File:Russell M. Nelson.png|upright|left|thumb|[[Russell M. Nelson]], current President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.]]
The LDS Church is organized in a hierarchical priesthood structure administered by men. Latter-day Saints believe that [[Jesus]] leads the church through revelation and has chosen a single man, called "the Prophet" or President of the Church, as his spokesman on the earth.  While there have been exceptions in the past, he and two counselors are normally ordained [[Apostle (Latter Day Saints)|apostles]] and form the [[First Presidency (LDS Church)|First Presidency]], the presiding body of the church; twelve other apostles form the [[Quorum of the Twelve Apostles (LDS Church)|Quorum of the Twelve Apostles]].<ref name="Haight, David B. 1986">{{citation|author-link=David B.

They exercise both [[ecclesiastical]] and administrative leadership over the church and direct the efforts of regional leaders down to the local level. General authorities and [[mission president]]s work full-time and typically receive stipends from church funds or investments.<ref>Ludlow, Daniel H., ''Latter-day Prophets Speak: Selections from the Sermons and Writings of Church Presidents'', 1948/1993, ch. 32.</ref>

Twice each year (in April and October), general authorities address the worldwide church through [[General Conference (LDS Church)|general conference]], which includes five two-hour sessions over the course of two days. General conference sessions are translated into as many as 80 languages and are broadcast from the 21,000-seat Conference Center in Salt Lake City.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/article/general-conference|title=Mormons Gather Twice a Year for General Conference|date=July 14, 2011|work=www.mormonnewsroom.org|access-date=March 13, 2018|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190627225153/https://newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/article/general-conference|archive-date=June 27, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> In addition to general conference, general authorities speak to church members in local congregations throughout the world; they also frequently speak to youth<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/broadcasts/face-to-face/nelson?lang=eng|title=Face to Face with President and Sister Nelson|website=www.churchofjesuschrist.org|access-date=March 13, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190717034624/https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/broadcasts/face-to-face/nelson?lang=eng|archive-date=July 17, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> and young adults<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/broadcasts/worldwide-devotional-for-young-adults?lang=eng|title=Worldwide Devotional for Young Adults|website=www.churchofjesuschrist.org|access-date=March 13, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190606070525/https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/broadcasts/worldwide-devotional-for-young-adults?lang=eng|archive-date=June 6, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> in special broadcasts and at the Church Educational System schools, such as [[Brigham Young University]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://speeches.byu.edu|title=BYU Devotionals, Forums, Commencement Addresses - BYU Speeches|website=BYU Speeches|language=en-US|access-date=March 13, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180224062323/https://speeches.byu.edu/|archive-date=February 24, 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>

At the local level, the church leadership are drawn from the laity and work on a part-time volunteer basis without stipend.<ref>For a time, the church had a paid local clergy; however, that practice was discontinued in the early 1900s. See [[D. Michael Quinn]] (1997), ''Mormon Hierarchy: Extensions of Power,'' Salt Lake City: Signature Books, ch. 6.</ref><!--

--> Like all members, they are asked to donate a tithe of 10 percent of their income to the church. An exception to that rule is for LDS missionaries, who work at the local level and are paid basic living expenses from a fund that receives contributions from their families or home congregations. However, prospective missionaries are encouraged to contribute the cost of their missions to this fund themselves when possible. Members volunteer general custodial work for local church facilities.

All males who are living the standards of the church are generally considered for the [[priesthood (Latter Day Saints)|priesthood]] and are ordained to the priesthood as early as age 11. Ordination occurs by a ceremony where [[laying on of hands|hands are laid]] on the head of the one ordained. The priesthood is divided into three [[Aaronic priesthood (LDS Church)|Aaronic priesthood]] quorums for young men 11 and up, and a [[Melchizedek Priesthood (Latter Day Saints)|Melchizedek priesthood]] quorum for men 18 and up.<ref>{{cite web|title = Aaronic Priesthood {{!}} The Priesthood of Aaron|url = https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/topics/aaronic-priesthood|website = www.churchofjesuschrist.org|access-date = December 3, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title = Melchizedek Priesthood|url = https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/scriptures/bd/melchizedek-priesthood|website = www.churchofjesuschrist.org|access-date = December 3, 2015}}</ref>

The church's welfare system, initiated during the [[Great Depression]], provides aid to the poor. It is financed by [[fast offering]]s: monthly donations beyond the normal 10 percent tithe, which represents the cost of forgoing two meals on monthly [[Fast Sunday]]s. Money from the program is used to operate [[Bishop's storehouse]]s, which package and store food at low cost. Distribution of funds and food is administered by local [[Bishop (Latter Day Saints)|bishops]]. The church also distributes money through its [[LDS Philanthropies]] division to disaster victims worldwide.

In December 2019, a whistleblower alleged the church holds over $100&nbsp;billion in investment funds through its investment management company, [[Ensign Peak Advisors]]; that it failed to use the funds for charitable purposes and instead used them in for-profit ventures; and that it misled contributors and the public about the usage and extent of those funds.

==Culture==
{{Main|Culture of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints}}
Due to the differences in lifestyle promoted by church doctrine and history, members of the church have developed a distinct culture. It is primarily concentrated in the [[Intermountain West]]. Many of the church's more distinctive practices include adhering to the Word of Wisdom, a health law or code which outlines guidelines for maintaining good health. Among these guidelines are instructions prohibiting the consumption of tobacco, alcohol, coffee, tea, and improper drug use.<ref name = wordofwisdom/> As a result of members adhering to the Word of Wisdom, areas of the world with a high concentration of LDS members practice these restrictions. They sometimes come into conflict with local retail businesses that serve non-members.<ref>{{citation |newspaper= The Salt Lake Tribune |author= Editorial Board |url= http://www.sltrib.com/ci_4903619 |title= Liquor stores: Banning phone listings, stores won't stop abuse |date= December 27, 2006 |access-date= December 30, 2006 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070926234713/http://www.sltrib.com/ci_4903619 |archive-date= September 26, 2007 |url-status= live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://health.usnews.com/articles/health/living-well-usn/2008/12/15/americas-10-fittest-citiesand-10-least-fit-too.html |title=America's 10 Fittest Cities—and 10 Least Fit, Too |author=Megan Johnson |date=December 15, 2008 |access-date=October 14, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091012075057/http://health.usnews.com/articles/health/living-well-usn/2008/12/15/americas-10-fittest-citiesand-10-least-fit-too.html |archive-date=October 12, 2009 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Meetings and outreach programs are held regularly and have become part of Latter-day Saint culture.

===Media and arts===
The culture has created substantial business opportunities for independent LDS media. Such communities include [[LDS cinema|cinema]], [[LDS fiction|fiction]], websites, and graphical art such as photography and paintings. The church owns a chain of bookstores called [[Deseret Book]], which provide a channel through which publications are sold. Titles including ''[[The Work and the Glory]]'' and ''[[The Other Side of Heaven]]'' have found acceptance both within and outside the church{{clarify|date=August 2020}}; [[BYU TV]], the church-sponsored television station, also airs on several networks. The church also produces [[List of pageants of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|several pageants]] annually depicting various events of the primitive and modern-day church. Its [[Mesa Arizona Easter Pageant|Easter pageant ''Jesus the Christ'']] has been identified as the "largest annual outdoor Easter pageant in the world".<ref name="EVT">{{Citation|url=http://www.eastvalleytribune.com/story/86475 |title=Mesa Mormon temple prepares for Easter pageant |work=[[East Valley Tribune]] |date=March 24, 2007 |first=Lawn |last=Griffiths |access-date=November 30, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070911150555/http://www.eastvalleytribune.com/story/86475 |archive-date=September 11, 2007 }}</ref>

===Home and family===
In 1995, the church's [[First Presidency (LDS Church)|First Presidency]] and [[Quorum of the Twelve (LDS Church)|Quorum of the Twelve]] issued "[[The Family: A Proclamation to the World]]", which stresses the importance of the family. The proclamation states that "[[Marriage in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|marriage]] between a man and a woman is ordained of God and that the family is central to the Creator's plan for the eternal destiny of His children." The document further says that "gender is an essential characteristic of individual premortal, mortal, and eternal identity and purpose," that the father and mother have differing but equal roles in raising children, and that successful marriages and families, founded upon the teachings of Jesus Christ, can last eternally.<ref>{{citation |url= http://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/topics/family-proclamation |title= The Family: A Proclamation to the World |publisher= LDS Church |year= 1995}}.

LDS Church members are encouraged to set aside one evening a week to spend together in what is called "[[Family Home Evening]]" (often abbreviated to FHE).

The adult women (members of the church's [[Relief Society]]) in a congregation meet at least quarterly for additional instruction and service. The meetings may consist of a service project, conferences, or of various classes being offered.

After interviewing and polling thousands of youth across America, evangelical statistician Christian Smith wrote in 2005, "in general comparisons among major U.S. religious traditions using a variety of sociological measures of religious vitality and salience ... it is Mormon teenagers who are sociologically faring the best."<ref>{{citation |first1= Christian |last1= Smith |first2= Melinda Lundquist |last2= Denton |title= Soul Searching: The Religious and Spiritual Lives of American Teenagers |page= 261 |publisher= Oxford University Press |year= 2005 |isbn= 019518095X |oclc= 55947930}}</ref>{{clarify|date=August 2020}}

===Social events and gatherings===

Additional meetings are also frequently held at the meetinghouse. Church officers may conduct leadership meetings or host training sessions and classes. The ward or branch community may schedule social activities at the meetinghouse, including dances, dinners, holiday parties and musical presentations. The church's [[Young Men (organization)|Young Men]] and [[Young Women (organization)|Young Women]] organizations meet at the meetinghouse once a week, where the youth participate in activities. In 2020, the church implemented a new initiative for children & youth worldwide (for ages 7–18) that focuses on four areas of personal and group development, and which replaced all other programs as of January 1 of that year.<ref name="FAQ" >[https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/bc/content/shared/english/pdf/children-and-youth/17313_000_notice.pdf?lang=eng Children and Youth—Overview and Frequently Asked Questions], Official Notice from Priesthood and Family Department, churchofjesuschrist.org. Retrieved January 8, 2019.</ref> Other popular activities are basketball, family history conferences, youth and singles conferences, dances, and various personal improvement classes.

Also beginning with the new initiative in 2020, during the summer, the LDS Church provides week-long experiences, known as For the Strength of Youth Conferences.  This effectively replaced what was previously known as [[Especially for Youth]], offered through BYU. The program is held Monday through Saturday during the summer months for youth ages 14 to 18. During this week, youth spend the night in college campus dorms and the day in various classes taught by adult religious educators, as well as participating in other various activities such as scripture study and dances.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Craig|first1=Chanelle|title=Especially For Youth|url=http://ldsefy.weebly.com|publisher=Chanelle Craig|access-date=March 5, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402142113/http://ldsefy.weebly.com/|archive-date=April 2, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Political involvement===
{{Main|LDS Church and politics in the United States}}
The LDS Church takes no partisan role in politics, stating that it will not "endorse, promote or oppose political parties, candidates or platforms; allow its church buildings, membership lists or other resources to be used for partisan political purposes; attempt to direct its members as to which candidate or party they should give their votes to ... or attempt to direct or dictate to a government leader".<ref name="PN">{{citation |url= https://newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/article/church-reemphasizes-political-neutrality |title= News Story: Church Reemphasizes Political Neutrality |date= December 6, 2007 |work= MormonNewsroom.org |publisher= LDS Church |access-date= July 18, 2019 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20190628211316/https://newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/article/church-reemphasizes-political-neutrality |archive-date= June 28, 2019 |url-status= live }}</ref>

While the church takes an apolitical approach to candidates, it encourages its members to play an active role as responsible citizens in their communities, including becoming informed about issues and voting in elections. It actively works to counter [[anti-Mormonism]] that may come up during political campaigns. A 2012 [[Pew Center]] on Religion and Public Life survey indicates that 74 percent of U.S. members lean towards the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]].<ref name="ABC News">{{cite web|url=https://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2012/01/pew-survey-most-mormons-feel-they-are-misunderstood-not-viewed-as-mainstream/|title=Majority of Mormons Lean Republican; Half Cite Discrimination Against Their Faith|date=January 12, 2012|publisher=ABC News|access-date=November 13, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120928081107/https://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2012/01/pew-survey-most-mormons-feel-they-are-misunderstood-not-viewed-as-mainstream/|archive-date=September 28, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> Some liberal members say they feel that they have to defend their worthiness due to political differences.<ref name="USA Today">{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2012/10/30/mormon-liberals-minority/1669155/|title=Liberal Mormons: A Minority Within a Minority|date=October 30, 2012|newspaper=USA Today|access-date=November 13, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121112125041/http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2012/10/30/mormon-liberals-minority/1669155/|archive-date=November 12, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Controversy and criticism==
{{See also|Criticism of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints}}
The LDS Church has been subject to criticism and sometimes [[Anti-Mormonism|discrimination]] since its early years in New York and [[Pennsylvania]]. In the late&nbsp;1820s, criticism centered around the claim by Joseph Smith to have been led to a set of gold plates from which the Book of Mormon was reputedly translated.

In the 1830s, the greatest criticism was for Smith's handling of a [[Kirtland Safety Society|banking failure]] in Kirtland, Ohio. After the Mormons migrated west, there was fear and suspicion about the LDS Church's political and military power in Missouri, culminating in the [[Mormon War (1838)|1838 Mormon War]] and the infamous Mormon Extermination Order (Missouri Executive Order 44) by Governor [[Lilburn Boggs]].  In the 1840s, criticism of the church centered on its [[theodemocracy|theocratic]] aspirations in Nauvoo, Illinois. Criticism of the practice of [[plural marriage]] and other doctrines taught by Smith were published in the ''[[Nauvoo Expositor]].'' Opposition led to a series of events culminating in [[Death of Joseph Smith|murder of Smith and his brother while jailed]] in 1844.
[[File:Prop8templeProtest.jpg|thumb|left|Protesters in front of the [[Newport Beach California Temple]] voicing their opposition to the church's support of [[California Proposition 8 (2008)|Prop 8]]]]

As the church began openly practicing [[plural marriage]] under [[Brigham Young]] during the second half of the 19th century, the church became the target of nationwide criticism for that practice, as well as for the church's theocratic aspirations in the Utah Territory. Beginning in 1857, the church also came under [[Mountain Meadows massacre and the media|significant media criticism]] after the [[Mountain Meadows massacre]] in southern Utah.

Academic critics have questioned the legitimacy of Smith as a prophet as well as the [[Criticism of the Book of Mormon|historical authenticity of the Book of Mormon]] and the [[Book of Abraham]]. Criticism has expanded to include claims of historical revisionism, homophobia, racism, and sexist policies. Notable 20th-century critics include [[Jerald and Sandra Tanner]] and historian [[Fawn Brodie]]. [[Evangelical Christians]] continue to argue that Smith was either fraudulent or [[delusion]]al.

[[Mormon apologetics]] organizations, such as the [[Foundation for Apologetic Information & Research]] (FAIR) and the [[Foundation for Ancient Research and Mormon Studies]] (FARMS), have been founded to counter these criticisms. Most of the apologetic work focuses on providing and discussing evidence supporting the claims of Smith and the Book of Mormon. Scholars and authors such as [[Hugh Nibley]], [[Daniel C. Peterson]], [[Jeff Lindsay (engineer)|Jeff Lindsay]], [[Orson Scott Card]], and [[James E. Talmage]] are well-known apologists within the church.

During the [[civil rights era]] of the 1960s and 1970s, the LDS Church was criticized for its [[Blacks and Mormonism|policy of excluding black men of African descent]] from the priesthood, a policy that the church changed in 1978.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Turner|first1=John G.|title=Out of Obscurity: Mormonism Since 1945|date=2016|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0199358229|pages=132–137|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cqdHDAAAQBAJ|access-date=September 23, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161022152125/https://books.google.com/books?id=cqdHDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|archive-date=October 22, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> In more recent years, the Internet has provided a new forum for proponents and critics of religions, including the LDS Church.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Sink |first1=Mindy |title=Religion Journal {{ndash}} Spiritual Issues Lead Many to the Net |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B04E3DB1F38F935A3575AC0A9659C8B63 |access-date=May 11, 2020 |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=September 6, 2003 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120211164640/https://www.nytimes.com/2003/09/06/nyregion/religion-journal-spiritual-issues-lead-many-to-the-net.html |archive-date=February 11, 2012 |url-status=unfit}}</ref><!-- archive link provides complete article -->{{cbignore|bot=InternetArchiveBot}}<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/21/us/some-mormons-search-the-web-and-find-doubt.html|title=Some Mormons Search the Web and Find Doubt|last=Goodstein|first=Laurie|date=July 20, 2013|work=New York Times|access-date=October 7, 2018|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181008025920/https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/21/us/some-mormons-search-the-web-and-find-doubt.html|archive-date=October 8, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

The [[Homosexuality and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|church's views on sexual minorities]] have also received criticism such as its 2008 requests by top leaders to adherents to donate time and money in the campaign for California's [[California Proposition 8 (2008)|Proposition 8]] against same-sex marriage which sparked heated debate and protest by gay-rights organizations and others.<ref>{{Citation | title = Mormons Tipped Scale in Ban on Gay Marriage | author = Jesse McKinley and Kirk Johnson | work = The New York Times | date = November 14, 2008 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/15/us/politics/15marriage.html?pagewanted=all | access-date = February 14, 2012 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120406204247/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/15/us/politics/15marriage.html?pagewanted=all | archive-date = April 6, 2012 | url-status = live | quote=Jeff Flint, another strategist with Protect Marriage, estimated that Mormons made up 80 percent to 90 percent of the early volunteers who walked door-to-door in election precincts. ...
