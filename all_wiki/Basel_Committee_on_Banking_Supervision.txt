The '''Basel Committee on Banking Supervision''' ('''BCBS''')<ref>[http://www.bis.org/bcbs Basel Committee on Banking Supervision]</ref> is a committee of banking supervisory authorities that was established by the [[central bank]] governors of the [[Group of Ten (economic)|Group of Ten]] countries in 1974.<ref>See the "History of the Basel Committee and its Membership" in http://www.bis.org/bcbs/history.pdf</ref> The committee expanded its membership in 2009 and then again in 2014. In 2019, the BCBS has 45 members from 28 Jurisdictions, consisting of Central Banks and authorities with responsibility of banking regulation.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.bis.org/bcbs/membership.htm/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=26 May 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190919225419/https://www.bis.org/bcbs/membership.htm |archive-date=19 September 2019 |url-status=dead }}</ref>
It provides a forum for regular cooperation on banking supervisory matters. Its objective is to enhance understanding of key supervisory issues and improve the quality of banking supervision worldwide. The Committee frames guidelines and standards in different areas – some of the better known among them are the international standards on capital adequacy, the Core Principles for Effective Banking Supervision and the Concordat on cross-border banking supervision.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bis.org/bcbs/about.htm|title=About the Basel Committee|date=28 June 2011|website=www.bis.org|access-date=30 August 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180627034103/https://www.bis.org/bcbs/about.htm|archive-date=27 June 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref> The Committee's Secretariat is located at the [[Bank for International Settlements|Bank for International Settlements (BIS)]] in [[Basel]], Switzerland.  The [[Bank for International Settlements|Bank for International Settlements (BIS)]] hosts and supports a number of international institutions engaged in standard setting and financial stability, one of which is BCBS. Yet like the other committees, BCBS has its own governance arrangements, reporting lines and agendas, guided by the [[central bank]] governors of the [[Group of Ten (economic)|Group of Ten]] (G10) countries.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bis.org/stability.htm|title=About committees and associations|date=4 August 2005|website=www.bis.org}}</ref>

==Goals==
Globalization in banking and financial markets was not accompanied by global regulation.  National regulators remained the most important actors in banking practices.  They had a capacity problem and an information problem.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/globalbusinessre00brai|title=Global business regulation|last=Braithwaite, John.|date=2000|publisher=Cambridge University Press|others=Drahos, Peter, 1955-|isbn=0521780330|location=Cambridge [England]|oclc=43719184|url-access=registration}}</ref>  Therefore, the purpose of the BCBS is to encourage convergence toward common approaches and standards. The Committee is not a classical multilateral organization, in part because it has no founding treaty. BCBS does not issue binding regulation; rather, it functions as an informal forum in which policy solutions and standards are developed.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.1111/j.1468-0491.2005.00294.x|title = Rules that Many Use: Standards and Global Regulation| journal=Governance| volume=18| issue=4| pages=611–632|year = 2005|last1 = Kerwer|first1 = Dieter}}</ref>

The Basel Committee formulates broad supervisory standards and guidelines and recommends statements of best practice in banking supervision (see [[bank regulation]] or "[[Basel III]] Accord", for example) in the expectation that member authorities and other nations' authorities will take steps to implement them through their own national systems.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

==Organization==
The Basel committee along with its sister organizations, the [[International Organization of Securities Commissions]] and [[International Association of Insurance Supervisors]] together make up the [[Joint Forum]] of international financial regulators.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}  However, the Committee is not autonomous.  Although it has latitude, its work is reported to the central bank Governors of the G10.  It cannot communicate conclusions, nor make proposals, to bodies outside the Bank for International Settlements without the general agreement and support of these Governors.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision : a history of the early years, 1974-1997|last=Goodhart, C. A. E. (Charles Albert Eric)|isbn=9781139117739|location=Cambridge, UK|oclc=769341794}}</ref>
