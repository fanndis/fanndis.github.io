The '''Kosovo Security Force''' ('''KSF'''; {{lang-sq|Forca e Sigurisë së Kosovës}}, {{lang-sr|Косовске безбедносне снаге|Kosovske bezbednosne snage}}) is the military of [[Kosovo]],{{efn|name=status}} tasked with territorial protection and crisis response operations in Kosovo and abroad. Its main tasks are territorial defense, [[search and rescue]], explosive ordnance and hazardous material disposal, and firefighting. The KSF's commander is Lieutenant General Rrahman Rama.

In March 2008, the [[NATO]]-led [[Kosovo Force]] (KFOR) and the [[Kosovo Protection Corps]] (KPC) started preparations for the formation of the Kosovo Security Force. According to guidance laid out in the [[Ahtisaari Plan]], the security force is permitted to carry light weapons and the Government of Kosovo and the international community planned to bring the force in line with NATO standards. The admission and the training of personnel began in early June, when NATO experts arrived in Kosovo to guide the process, and from early December 2008, enlisting of candidates between 18–30 years old began. In December 2018, the Assembly of Kosovo passed legislation to redefine the KSF as a "professional military force" and to establish a defence ministry.<ref name="aljazeera.com">{{cite web|url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/12/kosovo-approves-army-serbia-opposition-181214112921620.html|title=Kosovo approves new army despite Serbia opposition - News - Al Jazeera|website=www.aljazeera.com|access-date=14 December 2018}}</ref><ref name="reuters.com">{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-kosovo-army-idUSKBN1OD16S|title=Kosovo approves new army despite Serb opposition, NATO criticism|date=14 December 2018|access-date=14 December 2018|via=www.reuters.com}}</ref><ref>https://kallxo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/2824-2.pdf</ref>

==History==
===Kosovo Security Force===
[[File:FSK-Forca e Sigurise se Kosoves - KSF-Kosovo Security Force.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Kosovo Security Force's Standard-bearer]]
Following the [[Kosovo War]] in 1999, [[United Nations]] [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council]] [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244|Resolution 1244]] placed Kosovo under the authority of the [[United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo]] (UNMIK), with security provided by the [[NATO]]-led [[Kosovo Force]] (KFOR). KFOR entered Kosovo on June 12, 1999 under a [[United Nations]] mandate, two days after the adoption of [[UN Security Council]] [[UN Security Council Resolution 1244|Resolution 1244]].

Kosovo declared independence in February 2008. On 19 March 2008, [[United States]] President [[George W. Bush]] authorised military aid to Kosovo Security Force in another step to establish formal relations with Kosovo.<ref>[http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5jTYBWxbnwoby8z38DtzDO_W31Bww Bush OKs supplying arms to Kosovo], AFP, March 19, 2008.</ref>

On 20 January 2009, the names of those who were to be selected for the KSF from the KPC were announced.  After being vetted by NATO, roughly 1,400 former members of the KPC were selected to serve as officers and rank and file members of the KSF.

On 21 January 2009, the Kosovo Security Force was officially launched.  The KSF did not replace the Kosovo Protection Corps (KPC) which was disbanded several months later.  KFOR was charged with mentoring the KSF and bringing the force to Full Operational Capability.  As part of this effort, various nations that are part of KFOR have provided assistance to the force on a bilateral basis including uniforms which were supplied by the United States and vehicles which were donated by Germany. Mentoring efforts were meant to develop the KSF in line with NATO standards.<ref name="Kosovo Armed Forces">[http://www.newkosovareport.com/200812201507/Society/Lt.-Gen.-Selimi-appointed-as-Chief-of-Staff-of-Kosovo-Army.html "Lt.

The following senior officers took their oaths on 16 June 2009, under the supervision of then
KSF Commander Lieutenant-General [[Sylejman Selimi]]:<ref>[http://mksf-ks.org/?page=2,24,64 Ministry Press Release], 16 June 2009, Pristina</ref>

*Major-General Kadri Kastrati – Director of Operations

*Brigadier-General Zymer Halimi – Chief of Operations and Training Department
*Brigadier-General Imri Ilazi – Commander of Operations Support Brigade
*Brigadier-General Enver Cikaqi – Commander of Training and Doctrine Command

On 15 September 2009 the Kosovo Security Force officially began the work, with its initial operational capacities after an eight-month training with [[NATO]] instructors.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gazetaexpress.com/web/index.php/artikujt/lexo/15467/C4/C16/|title=FSK nis zyrtarisht punën|date=September 18, 2009|access-date=September 18, 2009|publisher=Gazeta Express|language=sq|location=Pristina, Kosovo|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140502013736/http://www.gazetaexpress.com/web/index.php/artikujt/lexo/15467/C4/C16/|archive-date=May 2, 2014}}</ref>

In 2010, the KSF deployed to northern Albania on two separate occasions to perform flood relief operations in support of the Albanian domestic response.

On 22 November 2011, Lieutenant General Sylejman Selimi retired from the KSF and President Atifete Jahjaga appointed the former Director of Operations Major General Kadri Kastrati to succeed him as Commander of the force.  President Jahjaga also promoted Kastrati to the rank of lieutenant general.

On 9 July 2013 the Kosovo Security Forces reached Full Operational Capability (FOC) as determined by NATO.<ref>{{cite news|title=NATO Secretary General statement on Kosovo Security Force reaching Full Operational Capability|url=http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/news_101882.htm?selectedLocale=en}}</ref> While the general security situation has been improving on the ground, this lightly armed force responsible for civil protection operations and assisting civil authorities in responding to natural disasters and other emergencies has now trained to standards designated by NATO. The declaration of full operational capability on 9 July 2013 by the North Atlantic Council means that the KSF is fully capable of performing the tasks assigned to it within its mandate. The KSF will conduct non-military security functions that are not appropriate for the police. In more concrete terms, this force of approximately 2200 personnel will deal with search and rescue operations, explosive ordnance disposal, control and clearance of hazardous materials, fire-fighting and other humanitarian assistance tasks.
Recruitment for the Kosovo Security Force started early 2009, once NATO had agreed (June 2008) to implement new tasks in addition to those agreed under UNSCR 1244. These new tasks included the standing down of the Kosovo Protection Corps, and the creation of the KSF and of a civilian structure to oversee it.

NATO's role in the creation of KSF has therefore been two-fold: helping with its formation – standing up, recruitment and training; and the establishment of a civilian-led organisation to supervise and control the KSF. One of the principal aims was to encourage all minorities to enroll, so special attention was given to carrying out the recruitment process in two languages – Albanian and Serbian. The result has been a professional, multi-ethnic, all-volunteer force, which should continue to remain a source of regional stability. Following the declaration of full operational capability, NATO will continue to support the development of the KSF through the NATO Liaison and Advisory Team (NLAT), consisting of a mix of approximately 30 military and civilian personnel that will help with the professional development of the KSF, providing advice and support in a variety of areas such as capacity-building and training and leadership.<ref>{{cite news|title=The Kosovo Security Force now self-sustainable|url=http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/news_101890.htm?selectedLocale=en}}</ref>

===Towards the Kosovo Armed Forces===
[[File:FSK (Orkestra Frymore e Forcës së Sigurisë të Kosovës).jpg|thumb|The [[Kosovo Security Force Band]].]]
On 5 March 2014, Prime Minister [[Hashim Thaçi]] declared that the Kosovan government had decided to establish a Defence Ministry and by 2019, officially transform the Kosovo Security Forces into the '''Kosovo Armed Forces''' ({{lang-sq|Forcat e Armatosura të Kosovës}}, FAK) which will meet all the standards of NATO states with the aim of joining the alliance in the future. The new army will have a €98 million annual budget and will be 5,000 strong with another 3,000 reservists, composed of land forces, a national guard, logistics and training commands.<ref>{{cite news|title=Kosovo to create national army of 5,000 soldiers|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2014/03/04/uk-kosovo-army-idUKBREA231E620140304|access-date=9 March 2014|publisher=Reuters|date=4 March 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Kosovo to Have Army by 2019|url=http://www.novinite.com/view_news.php?id=158657|access-date=9 March 2014|publisher=noinvite.com|date=5 March 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Kosovo to build its first national army|url=http://www.euronews.com/2014/03/04/kosovo-to-build-its-first-national-army/|access-date=11 March 2014|publisher=Euronews|date=4 March 2014}}</ref> Kosovo's Security Forces Minister [[Agim Çeku]] stated that the Kosovo Armed Forces' mission will be "to protect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Kosovo, its people and their property and protect the interests of the Kosovo Republic".<ref>{{cite news|title=Kosovo to Have Armed Forces by 2019|url=http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/kosovo-decides-to-form-kosovo-armed-forces|access-date=16 September 2014|publisher=Balkan Insight|date=4 March 2014}}</ref> Kosovo's ambassador to [[Turkey]], [[Avni Spahiu]], stated that the "decision to establish an army has been taken in consultation with NATO and our partners...

On 18 October 2018, the [[Assembly of the Republic of Kosovo|Kosovo Assembly]] approved to transform the Kosovo Security Force into the Kosovo Armed Forces within 10 years after 98 of the 120 deputies voted in favor, and the remaining 22 remained absent from the vote, including 11 representatives from the Serb minority who boycotted the vote.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Bozinovski |first1=Igor |title=Kosovo Security Forces to be transformed into army |url=https://www.janes.com/article/84038/kosovo-security-forces-to-be-transformed-into-army |website=IHS Jane's 360 |access-date=29 October 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181025142901/https://www.janes.com/article/84038/kosovo-security-forces-to-be-transformed-into-army |archive-date=25 October 2018 |location=Skopje |date=25 October 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref>

====Reactions====
Reactions to the transformation of KSF to KAF have been mixed. The move has been seen with scepticism by Serbia and by NATO, European Union and United Nations officials, but it has been endorsed by the [[United States Department of State|United States]], as well as the governments of Germany, United Kingdom and France.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dw.com/en/kosovo-legislature-approves-creation-of-national-army/a-46734640 |title=Kosovo legislature approves creation of national army |date=14 December 2018|publisher=www.dw.com|access-date=15 December 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://telegrafi.com/reagimi-frances-pas-formimit-te-ushtrise/ |title=Franca përkrahë transformimin e FSK-së në Ushtri të Kosovës |date=14 December 2018|publisher=www.telegrafi.com|access-date=15 December 2018}}</ref>

The Serbian authorities have repeatedly said that according to all international documents, and especially [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244|UN Resolution 1244]], [[NATO]]-led [[Kosovo Force|KFOR]] is the only legal military formation in Kosovo alongside 999 Serbian military personnel guaranteed by Resolution 1244.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.b92.net/eng/news/politics.php?yyyy=2018&mm=12&dd=14&nav_id=105760 |title=Kosovo army has no business in North, Serbs say  |date=14 December 2018|publisher=B92|access-date=14 December 2018}}</ref> [[Jens Stoltenberg]], [[Secretary General of NATO]], said he regrets that the Kosovo Assembly has decided to transform KSF despite concerns from the alliance, adding that "this move comes at the wrong time".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/14/world/europe/kosovo-army-serbia-nato.html |title=Kosovo Parliament Votes to Create an Army, Defying Serbia and NATO |date=14 December 2018|publisher=The New York Times|access-date=14 December 2018}}</ref> Also, [[Federica Mogherini]], [[High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy|European Union's foreign policy chief]] has expressed regret over Kosovo's move to form a new army.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/latest-kosovo-parliament-votes-form-army-59816303 |title=The Latest: Serbia calls new Kosovo army illegal |date=14 December 2018|publisher=abcnews.go.com|access-date=14 December 2018}}</ref> Furthermore, [[António Guterres]], [[UN Secretary-General]], expressed deep concern over the decision of Kosovo authorities, urging "all parties concerned" to exercise restraint.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rs.n1info.com/English/NEWS/a444312/UN-Security-Council-discusses-Kosovo-Guterres-calls-for-restraint.html |title=UN Security Council discusses Kosovo, Guterres calls for restraint |date=15 December 2018|publisher=N1|access-date=16 December 2018}}</ref>

On the other hand, the United States fully supports and endorses the move. In a statement, the US Embassy in Kosovo stated that Kosovo is a sovereign nation, and as such, it is allowed to have a force to defend its territory. They confirmed that the United States will continue to support the development of KAF, and that they expect the cooperation of the KAF and NATO to continue.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://xk.usembassy.gov/statement-from-u-s-embassy-pristina/|title=Statement from U.S. Embassy Pristina|date=14 December 2018|access-date=15 December 2018|via=xk.usembassy.gov}}</ref> The US.
