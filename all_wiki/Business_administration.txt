== Overview ==
The administration of a business includes the performance or management of [[business operations]] and [[decision-making]], as well as the efficient organization of people and other resources to direct activities towards common [[goal]]s and [[objective (disambiguation) | objective]]s. In general, "administration" refers to the broader [[management]] function, including the associated [[finance]], [[Employment |personnel]] and [[management information systems|MIS]] services.

Administration can refer to the [[bureaucracy| bureaucratic]] or [[Business operations| operational]] performance of routine office tasks,<ref>{{Cite book|last=Farazmand|first=Ali|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N3D4DpKDZq0C&q=Administration+can+refer+to+the+bureaucratic+or+operational+performance+of+routine+office+tasks&pg=PA241|title=Bureaucracy and Administration|date=2009-06-23|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1-4200-1522-5|language=en}}</ref> usually internally oriented and reactive rather than proactive. Administrators, broadly speaking, engage in a common set of functions to meet an organization's goals. [[Henri Fayol]] (1841-1925) described these "functions" of the administrator as "[[fayolism#Fayol's Elements of Management|the five elements of administration]]".<ref>{{Cite journal|date=2020-10-18|title=Henri Fayol, practitioner and theoretician – revered and reviled|url=https://doi.org/10.1108/17511341011073960|journal=Journal of Management History|doi=10.1108/17511341011073960|last1=Golden Pryor|first1=Mildred|last2=Taneja|first2=Sonia|volume=16|issue=4|pages=489–503}}</ref> According to Fayol, the five functions of management are;

# Organizing.
# Commanding.
# Coordinating.
