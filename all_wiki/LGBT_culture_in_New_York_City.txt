==History as gay metropolis==
{{see also|LGBT history in New York|Timeline of LGBT history in New York City}}
Charles Kaiser, author of ''The Gay Metropolis: The Landmark History of Gay Life in America'', wrote that in the era after [[World War II]], "New York City became the literal gay metropolis for hundreds of thousands of immigrants from both within and without the United States: the place they chose to learn how to live openly, honestly and without shame."<ref>Kaiser, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=HO7IKU79zgAC&pg=PR14 xiv].</ref>

===Stonewall Inn===
{{Main|Stonewall Inn}}
The Stonewall Inn, located at 51 and 53 [[Christopher Street]], along with several other establishments in the city, was owned by the [[Genovese crime family]].<ref name="duberman183">Duberman, p. 183.</ref> In 1966, three members of the [[American Mafia|Mafia]] invested $3,500 to turn the Stonewall Inn into a gay bar, after it had been a restaurant and a nightclub for heterosexuals. Once a week a police officer would collect envelopes of cash as a payoff; the Stonewall Inn had no [[liquor license]].<ref>Duberman, p. 185.</ref><ref>Carter, p. 68.</ref> It had no running water behind the bar—used glasses were run through tubs of water and immediately reused.<ref name="duberman181"/> There were no fire exits, and the toilets overran consistently.<ref>Carter, p. 80.</ref> Though the bar was not used for [[prostitution]], drug sales and other "cash transactions" took place. It was the only bar for gay men in New York City where dancing was allowed;<ref>Duberman, p. 182.</ref> dancing was its main draw since its re-opening as a gay club.<ref>Carter, p. 71.</ref>

Visitors to the Stonewall Inn in 1969 were greeted by a [[Bouncer (doorman)|bouncer]] who inspected them through a [[peephole]] in the door. The [[legal drinking age]] was 18, and to avoid unwittingly letting in [[undercover operation|undercover police]] (who were called "Lily Law", "Alice Blue Gown", or "Betty Badge"<ref name="duberman187">Duberman, p. 187.</ref>), visitors would have to be known by the doorman, or look gay. The entrance fee on weekends was $3, for which the customer received two tickets that could be exchanged for two drinks. Patrons were required to sign their names in a book to prove that the bar was a private "bottle club", but rarely signed their real names. There were two dance floors in the Stonewall; the interior was painted black, making it very dark inside, with pulsing gel lights or [[black light]]s. If police were spotted, regular white lights were turned on, signaling that everyone should stop dancing or touching.<ref name="duberman187"/> In the rear of the bar was a smaller room frequented by "''queens''"; it was one of two bars where [[effeminacy|effeminate]] men who wore makeup and teased their hair (though dressed in men's clothing) could go.<ref name="duberman189">Duberman, p. 189.</ref> Only a few [[Transvestism|transvestite]]s, or men in full [[Drag (clothing)|drag]], were allowed in by the bouncers. The customers were "98 percent male" but a few lesbians sometimes came to the bar. Younger homeless adolescent males, who slept in nearby [[Christopher Park]], would often try to get in so customers would buy them drinks.<ref>Duberman, p. 188.</ref> The age of the clientele ranged between the upper teens and early thirties, and the racial mix was evenly distributed among white, Black, and [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanic]] patrons.<ref name="duberman189"/><ref>Deitcher, p. 70.</ref> Because of its even mix of people, its location, and the attraction of dancing, the 
Stonewall Inn was known by many as "''the'' gay bar in the city".<ref>Carter p. 74.</ref>

[[Police raid]]s on gay bars were frequent, occurring on average once a month for each bar. Many bars kept extra liquor in a secret panel behind the bar, or in a car down the block, to facilitate resuming business as quickly as possible if alcohol was seized.<ref name="duberman183"/> Bar management usually knew about raids beforehand due to police tip-offs, and raids occurred early enough in the evening that business could commence after the police had finished.<ref name="duberman192-193">Duberman, pp. 192–193.</ref> During a typical raid, the lights were turned on, and customers were lined up and their identification cards checked. Those without identification or dressed in full drag were arrested; others were allowed to leave. Some of the men, including those in drag, used their [[Conscription|draft card]]s as identification. Women were required to wear three pieces of feminine clothing, and would be arrested if found not wearing them. Employees and management of the bars were also typically arrested.<ref name="duberman192-193"/> The period immediately before June 28, 1969, was marked by frequent raids of local bars—including a raid at the Stonewall Inn on the Tuesday before the riots<ref>Carter, pp. 124–125.</ref>—and the closing of the Checkerboard, the Tele-Star, and two other clubs in Greenwich Village.<ref name="nyt62969">{{Cite news |last=Eskow |first=Dennis |title=4 Policemen Hurt in 'Village' Raid: Melee Near Sheridan Square Follows Action at Bar |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9D0DE5DB1639EF3BBC4151DFB0668382679EDE |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=June 29, 1969 |page=33}} {{subscription required}}</ref>

On June 23, 2015, the Stonewall Inn was the first landmark in New York City to be recognized by the [[New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission]] on the basis of its status in LGBT history,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.northjersey.com/news/nyc-grants-landmark-status-to-gay-rights-movement-building-1.1361241|title=NYC grants landmark status to gay rights movement building|agency=Associated Press|publisher=NorthJersey.com|date=June 23, 2015|accessdate=June 23, 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303201003/http://www.northjersey.com/news/nyc-grants-landmark-status-to-gay-rights-movement-building-1.1361241|archivedate=March 3, 2016|df=}}</ref> and on June 24, 2016, the [[Stonewall National Monument]] was named the first [[List of U.S. National Monuments|U.S. National Monument]] dedicated to the LGBTQ-rights movement.<ref name="StonewallNationalMonument1"/>

===Stonewall riots===
{{main|Stonewall riots}}

====Police raid====
[[File:Layout of the Stonewall Inn 1969-en.svg|thumb|alt=A color digital illustration of the station layout of the Stonewall Inn in 1969: a rectangular building with the front along Christopher Street; the entrance opens to a lobby where patrons could go to the larger part of the bar to the right that also featured a larger dance floor. From that room was an entrance to a smaller room with a smaller dance floor and smaller bar. The toilets are located near the rear of the building|Layout of the Stonewall Inn, 1969<ref>Carter, photo spread, p. 1.</ref>]]

At 1:20&nbsp;a.m. on Saturday, June 28, 1969, four plainclothes policemen in dark suits, two patrol officers in uniform, and Detective Charles Smythe and Deputy Inspector [[Seymour Pine]] arrived at the Stonewall Inn's double doors and announced "Police! We're taking the place!"<ref name="Carter, p. 137.">Carter, p. 137.</ref> Stonewall employees do not recall being tipped off that a raid was to occur that night, as was the custom. According to Duberman (p.&nbsp;194), there was a rumor that one might happen, but since it was much later than raids generally took place, Stonewall management thought the tip was inaccurate. Days after the raid, one of the bar owners complained that the tipoff had never come, and that the raid was ordered by the [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms]], who objected that there were no [[Revenue stamp|stamps]] on the liquor bottles, indicating the alcohol was [[Rum-running|bootlegged]].

Historian David Carter presents information<ref>Carter, pp. 96–103</ref> indicating that the Mafia owners of the Stonewall and the manager were blackmailing wealthier customers, particularly those who worked in Lower Manhattan's [[Financial District, Manhattan|Financial District]]. They appeared to be making more money from extortion than they were from liquor sales in the bar. Carter deduces that when the police were unable to receive kickbacks from blackmail and the theft of negotiable bonds (facilitated by pressuring gay [[Wall Street]] customers), they decided to close the Stonewall Inn permanently. Two undercover policewomen and two undercover policemen had entered the bar earlier that evening to gather visual evidence, as the Public Morals Squad waited outside for the signal. Once inside, they called for backup from the Sixth Precinct using the bar's pay telephone. The music was turned off and the main lights were turned on. Approximately 205&nbsp;people were in the bar that night. Patrons who had never experienced a police raid were confused. A few who realized what was 
happening began to run for doors and windows in the bathrooms, but police barred the doors. As Michael Fader remembered,

<blockquote>Things happened so fast you kind of got caught not knowing. All of a sudden there were police there and we were told to all get in lines and to have our identification ready to be led out of the bar.</blockquote>

The raid did not go as planned. Standard procedure was to line up the patrons, check their identification, and have female police officers take customers dressed as women to the bathroom to verify their gender, upon which any men dressed as women would be arrested. Those dressed as women that night refused to go with the officers. Men in line began to refuse to produce their identification. The police decided to take everyone present to the police station, after separating those cross-dressing in a room in the back of the bar. Maria Ritter, then known as Steve to her family, recalled, "My biggest fear was that I would get arrested. My second biggest fear was that my picture would be in a newspaper or on a television report in my mother's dress!"<ref name="carter142">Carter, p. 142.</ref> Both patrons and police recalled that a sense of discomfort spread very quickly, spurred by police who began to assault some of the lesbians by "feeling some of them up inappropriately" while frisking them.<ref>Carter, p. 141.</ref>

===Manhattan===
[[Chelsea, Manhattan|Chelsea]] in Manhattan has become a focal point of [[LGBT community|gay socialization]].

The [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]]/[[Lower East Side]] area of Manhattan is also a [[gayborhood]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/02/arts/o-mad-night.html|title=O Mad Night! 2016 ends with an 11-hour culture crawl through an opera, a house party, two concerts, a masquerade ball and an East Village gay bar|first=Isaac|last=Oliver|newspaper=The New York Times|date=January 2, 2017|accessdate=January 2, 2017|quote=The Cock, a delightfully perverse gay bar on Second Avenue, ...}}</ref> [[Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan|Hell's Kitchen]] and [[Morningside Heights]] are additional Manhattan neighborhoods which have developed a significant LGBT presence of their own.<ref name=RosenbergDunfordp379/>

====Greenwich Village====
{{main|Greenwich Village}}
[[File:LGBT Community Center.jpg|thumb|[[Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual & Transgender Community Center]]]]
The [[Manhattan]] neighborhoods of Greenwich Village and [[Harlem]] were home to a sizable homosexual population after [[World War I]], when men and women who had served in the military took advantage of the opportunity to settle in larger cities. The enclaves of gays and lesbians, described by a newspaper story as "short-haired women and long-haired men", developed a distinct subculture through the following two decades.<ref>Edsall, pp. 253–254.</ref> [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]] inadvertently benefited gay establishments, as drinking alcohol was pushed underground along with other behaviors considered immoral. New York City passed laws against homosexuality in public and private businesses, but because alcohol was in high demand, [[Speakeasy|speakeasies]] and impromptu drinking establishments were so numerous and temporary that authorities were unable to police them all.<ref>Edsall, pp. 255–256.</ref> However, police raids happened, resulting in their closure, such as the [[Eve's Hangout]] at 129 [[MacDougal Street]], after the deportation of [[Eva Kotchever]] for [[United States obscenity law|obscenity]].<ref name=Gattuso>{{cite web|last=Gattuso|first=Reina|url=http://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/what-was-first-gay-bar|title=The Founder of America's Earliest Lesbian Bar Was Deported for Obscenity|website=[[Atlas Obscura]]|date=September 3, 2019}}</ref>

=====<small>As gay urban bohemia</small>=====
The [[oppression|social repression]] of the 1950s resulted in a [[ethnocentrism|cultural revolution]] in Greenwich Village. A cohort of poets, later named the [[Beat Generation|Beat]] poets, wrote about the evils of the social organization at the time, glorifying [[anarchy]], drugs, and [[hedonism|hedonistic pleasures]] over unquestioning social compliance, [[consumerism]], and closed mindedness. Of them, [[Allen Ginsberg]] and [[William S. Burroughs]]—both Greenwich Village residents—also wrote bluntly and honestly about homosexuality. Their writings attracted sympathetic [[liberalism|liberal-minded]] people, as well as homosexuals looking for a community.<ref>Adam, pp. 68–69.</ref>

[[File:Gay street.jpg|thumb|right|[[Gay Street (Manhattan)|Gay Street]], at the corner of Waverly Place, in Greenwich Village]]

=====<small>Strife in 1960s</small>=====
By the early 1960s, a campaign to rid New York City of gay bars was in full effect by order of Mayor [[Robert F. Wagner, Jr.]], who was concerned about the image of the city in preparation for the [[1964 New York World's Fair|1964 World's Fair]]. The city revoked the liquor licenses of the bars, and undercover police officers worked to entrap as many homosexual men as possible.<ref>Carter, pp. 29–37.</ref> [[Entrapment]] usually consisted of an undercover officer who found a man in a bar or public park, engaged him in conversation; if the conversation headed toward the possibility that they might leave together—or the officer bought the man a drink—he was arrested for [[solicitation]]. One story in the ''[[New York Post]]'' described an arrest in a gym locker room, where the officer grabbed his [[crotch]], moaning, and a man who asked him if he was all right was arrested.<ref>Carter, p. 46.</ref> Few lawyers would defend cases as undesirable as these, and some of those lawyers kicked back their fees to the arresting officer.<ref>Duberman, pp. 116–117.</ref>

The Mattachine Society succeeded in getting newly elected Mayor [[John Lindsay]] to end the campaign of police entrapment in New York City. They had a more difficult time with the [[Alcohol laws of New York|New York State Liquor Authority]] (SLA). While no laws prohibited serving homosexuals, courts allowed the SLA discretion in approving and revoking liquor licenses for businesses that might become "disorderly".<ref>Carter, p. 48.</ref> Despite the high population of gays and lesbians who called Greenwich Village home, very few places existed, other than bars, where they were able to congregate openly without being harassed or arrested. In 1966, the New York Mattachine held a "sip-in" at a Greenwich Village bar named [[Julius (New York City)|Julius]], which was frequented by gay men, to illustrate the discrimination homosexuals faced.<ref>Jackson, Sharyn (June 17, 2008). [http://www.villagevoice.com/2008-06-17/news/before-stonewall/ "Before Stonewall: Remembering that, before the riots, there was a Sip-In"]. ''The Village Voice''. Retrieved September 8, 2008.</ref>

None of the bars frequented by gays and lesbians were owned by gay people in the 1960s. Almost all of them were owned and controlled by [[American Mafia|organized crime]], who treated the regulars poorly, watered down the liquor, and overcharged for drinks. However, they also paid off police to prevent frequent raids.<ref name="duberman181">Duberman, p. 181.</ref>

=====<small>Modern history</small>=====
Greenwich Village contained the world's oldest gay and lesbian bookstore, [[Oscar Wilde Bookshop]], founded in 1967 but permanently closed in 2009 citing the recession and the rise of [[e-book|online booksellers]]. The Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual & Transgender Community Center – best known as simply "The Center" – has occupied the former Food & Maritime Trades High School at 208 West 13th Street since 1984.  In 2006, the Village was the scene of [[2006 Greenwich Village assault case|an assault involving seven lesbians and a straight man]] that sparked appreciable media attention, with strong statements both defending and attacking the parties. In June 2015, thousands gathered in front of the Stonewall Inn to celebrate the ruling by the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] affirming same-sex marriage in all fifty U.S. states, while in June 2016, thousands gathered similarly in vigil for the [[Orlando Pulse Shooting|Orlando Pulse Nightclub massacre]].<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/outward/2016/06/14/mourning_protest_mingle_for_orlando_pulse_victims_at_stonewall_vigil.html|title=Grief and protest Mingle at the Stonewall Vigil for the Pulse Nightclub Massacre|first=Aymann|last=Ismail|magazine=Slate|date=June 14, 2016|accessdate=February 12, 2017}}</ref> In February 2017, thousands protested at the Stonewall National Monument against the proposed policies of the [[administration (government)|administration]] of U.S. president [[Donald J.

Politics in New York City are mainly [[Liberalism in the United States|liberal]]. Rosenberg and Dunford stated that this political standpoint had historically been "generally beneficial to the gay community".<ref name=RosenbergDunfordp379/>

In New York City, [[New York State Republican Committee|New York City Republican Party]] political administrations actively court LGBT voters.<ref name=RosenbergDunfordp379/> LGBT voters were 3.4% of New York City's electorate in 1989.<ref name=Haider-Markelp145>Haider-Markel, Donald P.

In the mid-1970s, LGBT participation in New York City politics began. In the 1977 [[Mayor of New York City]] elections, [[Edward Koch]] was the preferred candidate; there had been speculation that Koch was homosexual. However, Koch associated with religious figures opposed to homosexuality and did not pass LGBT civil rights bills, and therefore in 1981, [[Frank Barbaro]] became the candidate favored by the LGBT political groups.<ref>Haider-Markel, Donald P.

[[Christine Quinn]] served as Speaker of the New York City Council between 2006 and 2013. Carlos Menchaca also became the first [[Mexican American]] member of the New York City Council when elected in November 2013.

In June 2019, in celebration of [[LGBT Pride Month]], Governor [[Andrew Cuomo]] ordered that the [[Rainbow flag (LGBT movement)|LGBT pride flag]] to be raised over the [[New York State Capitol]] for the first time in New York State history.<ref>https://www.rochesterfirst.com/news/local-news/lgbtq-pride-flag-raised-over-thestatecapitol-for-the-first-time-in-ny-state-history/2055297395?</ref>

===History of the New York City Pride parade===
Early on the morning of Saturday, June 28, 1969, gay (LGBT) individuals [[riot]]ed following a police raid on the [[Stonewall Inn]], a [[gay bar]] at 53 Christopher Street, in the West Village of [[Lower Manhattan]]. This riot and further protests and rioting over the following nights were the watershed moment in modern LGBT Rights Movement and the impetus for organizing LGBT pride marches on a much larger public scale.

On November 2, 1969, [[Craig Rodwell]], his partner Fred Sargeant, [[Ellen Broidy]], and Linda Rhodes proposed the first pride march to be held in New York City by way of a resolution at the Eastern Regional Conference of Homophile Organizations (ERCHO) meeting in [[Philadelphia]].<ref>[http://www.villagevoice.com/2010-06-22/news/1970-a-first-person-account-of-the-first-gay-pride-march// Sargeant, Fred.

''Christopher Street Liberation Day'' on June 28, 1970 marked the first anniversary of the Stonewall riots with an assembly on Christopher Street and the first [[Pride parade|LGBT Pride march]] in U.S. history, covering the 51&nbsp;blocks to [[Central Park]]. The march took less than half the scheduled time due to excitement, but also due to wariness about walking through the city with gay banners and signs.
