The newspaper announced that this was an attempt to contribute to the debate about [[criticism of Islam]] and self-censorship. Muslim groups in [[Denmark]] complained, and the issue eventually led to protests around the world, including violent demonstrations and riots in some [[Muslim world|Muslim countries]].<ref>Jensen, Tim (2006).

Islam has a strong tradition of [[Aniconism in Islam|aniconism]], and it is considered [[Islam and blasphemy|highly blasphemous in most Islamic traditions]] to visually depict Muhammad. This, compounded with a sense that the cartoons insulted Muhammad and Islam, offended many Muslims. Danish Muslim organisations that objected to the depictions responded by petitioning the embassies of Islamic countries and the Danish government to take action in response, and filed a judicial complaint against the newspaper, which was dismissed in January 2006. After the Danish government refused to meet with diplomatic representatives of the Muslim countries and would not intervene in the case, a number of Danish [[imam]]s headed by Ahmed Akkari visited the Middle East in late 2005 to gather support around the issue. They presented a dossier containing the twelve cartoons from the ''Jyllands-Posten'', and other depictions of Mohammed alongside them, some real and some fake, including one where they claimed he was portrayed as a pig, seen as [[Religious restrictions on the consumption of pork|forbidden and unclean]] in Islam. This last image was proven to be an Associated Press photograph of a contestant in a pig-squealing contest and, when presented with this and other falsehoods, the delegation's press spokesman admitted the goal of the tour had been to stir up hostility.<ref name="DW article - free speech and Muhammad cartoons">{{cite web |title=Free speech at issue 10 years after Muhammad cartoons controversy |url=https://www.dw.com/en/free-speech-at-issue-10-years-after-muhammad-cartoons-controversy/a-18747856 |website=DW |accessdate=7 November 2019}}</ref><ref name=responsibilities /><ref name="hansen&hundevadt" />{{Rp|80-4}}

The issue received prominent media attention in some Muslim-majority countries, leading to protests across the world in late January and early February 2006. Some escalated into violence, resulting in more than 250 reported deaths, attacks on Danish and other European diplomatic missions, attacks on churches and Christians, and a boycott of Denmark. Some groups responded to the intense pro-aniconist protests by endorsing the Danish policies, launching "Buy Danish" campaigns and other displays of support for freedom of expression. The cartoons were reprinted in newspapers around the world, both in a sense of journalistic solidarity and as an illustration in what became a major news story.

Danish Prime Minister [[Anders Fogh Rasmussen]] described the controversy as Denmark's worst international relations incident since the [[Denmark in World War II|Second World War]]. The incident came at a time of heightened political and social tensions between [[Islam by country|Muslim majority countries]] and [[Western world|Western countries]], following several, high-profile [[Islamic terrorism|radical Islamic terrorist attacks]] in the West{{mdash}}including the [[September 11 attacks]]{{mdash}}and Western military interventions in Muslim countries, such as [[American occupation of Iraq|Iraq]] and [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Afghanistan]]. The relationship between Muslims in Denmark and broader society was similarly at a low point, and the conflict came to symbolize the discrepancies and idiosyncrasies between the Islamic community and the rest of society. In the years since, jihadist terrorist plots claiming to be in retaliation for the cartoons have been planned{{mdash}}and some executed{{mdash}}against targets affiliated with ''Jyllands-Posten'' and its employees, Denmark, or newspapers that published the cartoons and other caricatures of [[Prophets and messengers in Islam|Islamic prophets]], most notably the [[Charlie Hebdo shooting]] in 2015.

Supporters said that the publication of the cartoons was a legitimate exercise in [[Freedom of speech|free speech]]: regardless of the content of the expression, it was important to openly discuss Islam without fear of terror, also stating that the cartoons made important points about critical issues. The Danish tradition of relatively high tolerance for freedom of speech became the focus of some attention. The controversy ignited a debate about the limits of freedom of expression in all societies, religious tolerance and the relationship of Muslim minorities with their broader societies in the West, and relations between the [[Islamic world]] in general and [[Western world|the West]].

=== Debate about self-censorship ===
On 16 September 2005, Danish news service [[Ritzau]] published an article discussing the difficulty encountered by the writer [[Kåre Bluitgen]], who was initially unable to find an illustrator prepared to work on his children's book ''The Qur'an and the life of the Prophet Muhammad'' ({{Lang-da|Koranen og profeten Muhammeds liv}}).<ref name=hansen&hundevadt>{{cite book |last1=Hansen |first1=John |title=Provoen og Profeten: Muhammed Krisen bag kulisserne |year=2006 |publisher=Jyllands-Postens Forlag |location=Copenhagen |isbn=978-87-7692-092-0 |first2=Kim |last2=Hundevadt |language=da}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Bluitgen |first=Kåre |title=Koranen og profeten Muhammeds liv |year=2006 |publisher=Høst & Søn/Tøkk |isbn=978-87-638-0049-5 |page=268 |url=http://www.digibutik.dk/?ID=250&GroupID=250&ProductID=PROD1179&pgid=GROUP249&qq=8D7SR65SK7TUB%2048D9LG6B%20L7T |others=Anonymous illustrator |language=da |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150118123641/http://www.digibutik.dk/?ID=250&GroupID=250&ProductID=PROD1179&pgid=GROUP249&qq=8D7SR65SK7TUB%2048D9LG6B%20L7T |archive-date=18 January 2015 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> Three artists declined Bluitgen's proposal out of fear of reprisals.

=== Publication ===

At an editorial meeting of ''[[Jyllands-Posten]]'' ('The [[Jutland]] Post', Denmark's largest daily newspaper) on 19 September, reporter Stig Olesen put forward the idea of asking the members of the newspaper illustrators union if they would be willing to draw Muhammad.<ref name="hansen&hundevadt" />{{Rp|14}} This would be an experiment to see the degree to which professional illustrators felt threatened. [[Flemming Rose]], culture editor, was interested in the idea and wrote to the 42 members of the union asking them to draw their interpretations of Muhammad.<ref name="whyipub" /><ref name="hansen&hundevadt" />{{Rp|15}}

15 illustrators responded to the letter; three declined to participate, one did not know how to contribute to what he called a vague project, one thought the project was stupid and badly paid, and one said he was afraid.<ref name="hansen&hundevadt" />{{Rp|17}} 12 drawings had been submitted{{mdash}}three from newspaper employees and two which did not directly show Muhammad.<ref name="hansen&hundevadt" />{{Rp|17}} The editors thought that some of the illustrators who had not responded were employed by other newspapers and were thus contractually prohibited from working for ''Jyllands-Posten.'' In the end, editor-in-chief [[Carsten Juste]] decided that given its inconclusive results, the story was better suited as an opinion piece rather than a news story, and it was decided to publish it in the culture section, entirely under the direction of editor Flemming Rose.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

[[Peter Hervik]], a professor of Migration Studies, has since written that the results of this experiment disproved the idea that self-censorship was a serious problem in Denmark because the overwhelming majority of cartoonists had either responded positively or refused for contractual or philosophical reasons.<ref name=IMER /> Carsten Juste has said that the survey "lacked validity and the story fell short of sound journalistic basis."<ref name=IMER /> Hervik said that this, along with the fact that the most controversial cartoons were drawn by the newspaper's staff cartoonists, demonstrates that the newspaper's "desire to provoke and insult Danish Muslims exceeded the wish to test the self-censorship of Danish cartoonists."<ref name=IMER />

Rose wrote the editorial which accompanied the cartoons in which he argued there had been several recent cases of self-censorship, weighing freedom of speech against the fear of confronting issues about Islam, so he thought it was legitimate news story. Among the incidents he cited were: the translators of a book critical of Islam did not want their names published; the [[Tate gallery]] in London withdrew an installation by the avant-garde artist [[John Latham (artist)|John Latham]] depicting the Quran, Bible and Talmud torn to pieces, and comedian [[Frank Hvam]] said in an interview with ''Jyllands-Posten'' that he would hypothetically dare to urinate on the Bible on television, but not on the Quran. Rose also mentioned the case of a Danish imam who had met with Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen and "called on the prime minister to interfere with the press in order to get more positive coverage of Islam."<ref name="whyipub" />

On 30 September 2005, ''Jyllands-Posten'' published an article entitled "{{Lang-da|Muhammeds ansigt|label=none}}" ('The face of Muhammad') incorporating the cartoons.<ref name="muhammeds_ansigt">{{cite news |first=Flemming |last=Rose |date=29 September 2005 |title=Muhammeds ansigt |newspaper=Jyllands-Posten |url=http://jyllands-posten.dk/indland/ECE4769352/muhammeds-ansigt/ |language=da |accessdate=18 September 2013 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150225235648/http://jyllands-posten.dk/indland/ECE4769352/muhammeds-ansigt/ |archive-date=25 February 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The article consisted of the 12 cartoons and an explanatory text, in which Rose wrote:

{{quote|Modern, secular society is rejected by some Muslims. They demand a special position, insisting on special consideration of their own religious feelings. It is incompatible with contemporary democracy and freedom of speech, where one must be ready to put up with insults, mockery and ridicule. It is certainly not always attractive and nice to look at, and it does not mean that religious feelings should be made fun of at any price, but that is of minor importance in the present context.&nbsp;... we are on our way to a slippery slope where no-one can tell how the self-censorship will end. That is why ''Morgenavisen Jyllands-Posten'' has invited members of the Danish editorial cartoonists union to draw Muhammad as they see him.|3=|source=}}

Later, Rose explained his intent further in ''[[The Washington Post]]'': "The cartoonists treated Islam the same way they treat Christianity, Buddhism, Hinduism and other religions. And by treating Muslims in Denmark as equals they made a point: We are integrating you into the Danish tradition of satire because you are part of our society, not strangers. The cartoons are including, rather than excluding, Muslims."<ref name="whyipub" /> The publication of the cartoons was also accompanied by an editorial titled "{{Lang-da|Truslen fra mørket|label=none}}" ('The Threat from  the Darkness') condemning Islamic spiritual leaders "who feel entitled to interpret the prophet's word, and cannot abide the insult that comes from being the object of intelligent satire."<ref name=IMER /> In October 2005, ''Politiken'', another leading Danish newspaper, published its own poll of thirty-one of the forty-three members of the Danish cartoonist association. Twenty-three said they would be willing to draw Muhammad. One had doubts, one would not be willing because of fear of possible reprisals, and six artists would not be willing because they respected the Muslim ban on depicting Muhammad.<ref>{{cite news |title=Profetens ansigt: Ingen selvcensur blandt tegnere (''The prophet's face: No Self Censorship among illustrators'') |newspaper=Politiken |date=20 October 2005 |page=Section 2, page 3 |language=da}}</ref>

=== Description of the cartoons ===
{{Main|Descriptions of the Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons}}

The 12 cartoons were drawn by 12 professional cartoonists in Denmark. Four of the cartoons have Danish texts, one deliberately evades the issue and depicts a school child in Denmark named Muhammad rather than the [[Prophets in Islam|Islamic prophet]], one is based on a Danish cultural expression, and one includes a Danish politician.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

=== Response ===

The immediate responses to the publication included newspaper sellers refusing to distribute that day's paper.<ref name=":0">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lHUIuy2Y5AQC&q=Klausen,+Jytte+The+Cartoons |title=The Cartoons That Shook the World |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160624082203/https://books.google.com/books?id=lHUIuy2Y5AQC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Klausen,+Jytte+The+Cartoons&hl=en&sa=X&ei=5bGHUq6oMIrNtAbj_oHQCg&ved=0CD0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=September%2030%2C%202005&f=false |archive-date=24 June 2016 |df=dmy-all |isbn=978-0300155068 |last1=Klausen |first1=Jytte |year=2009 }}</ref> In the following days, the cartoons received significant attention in other Danish press outlets. According to [[Jytte Klausen]], "most people groaned that the newspaper was at it again, bashing Muslims. The instinct was to split the blame."<ref name="Klausen, 2009. p. 17">Klausen, 2009. p. 17.</ref> ''[[Berlingske|Berlingske-Tidende]]'' criticised the 'gag', but also said that Islam should be openly criticised. ''Politiken'' attacked Rose's account of growing self-censorship; it also surveyed Danish cartoonists and said that self-censorship was not generally perceived as a problem.<ref name=":0" />{{Rp|17}} On October 4, a local teenager telephoned the newspaper offices threatening to kill the cartoonists, but he was arrested after his mother turned him in.<ref name=":0" />{{Rp|185}}

Shortly after the publication, a group of Islamic leaders formed a protest group. [[Raed Hlayhel]] called a meeting to discuss their strategy, which took place in Copenhagen a few days after the cartoons appeared.<ref name=":0" />{{Rp|185}} The Islamic Faith Community and four mosques from around the country were represented. The meeting established 19 "action points" to try to influence public opinion about the cartoons. [[Ahmed Akkari]] from an  mosque in Aarhus was designated the group's spokesman. The group planned a variety of political activities, including launching a legal complaint against the newspaper,  writing letters to media outlets inside and outside Denmark, contacting politicians and diplomatic representatives, organising a protest in Copenhagen, and mobilising Danish Muslims through text messages and mosques.<ref name=":0" />{{Rp|86}} A one-day strike and sleep-in were planned, but never took place.<ref name=":0" />{{Rp|86}} A peaceful protest, which attracted about 3,500 demonstrators, was held in Copenhagen on 14 October 2005.<ref name=":0" />{{Rp|186}}

On 6 January 2006, the Regional Public Prosecutor in [[Viborg, Denmark|Viborg]] discontinued the investigation as he found no basis for concluding that the cartoons constituted a criminal offence because the publication concerned a subject of public interest and Danish [[case law]] extends editorial freedom to journalists regarding subjects of public interest. He stated that in assessing what constitutes an offence, the right to freedom of speech must be taken into consideration, and said that freedom of speech must be exercised with the necessary respect for other human rights, including the right to protection against discrimination, insult and degradation.<ref name="danish_response_to_un_jan" /> In a new hearing resulting from a complaint about the original decision, the Director of Public Prosecutors in Denmark agreed with the previous ruling.<ref name=rigsadvokat />

In December, after failing to make any progress with the Danish government or the newspaper, the "Committee for Prophet Honouring" decided to gain support and leverage outside of Denmark by meeting directly with religious and political leaders in the Middle East. They created a 43-page dossier, commonly known as the [[Akkari-Laban dossier|''Akkari-Laban'' dossier]] ({{lang-ar|ملف عكّاري لبن}}; after two leading imams), containing the cartoons and supporting materials for their meetings.<ref name=clash>{{cite news |url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/0,1518,398624,00.html |date=1 February 2006 |title=Alienated Danish Muslims Sought Help from Arabs |newspaper=Spiegel Online International |accessdate=6 December 2012 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120307221716/http://www.spiegel.de/international/0,1518,398624,00.html |archive-date=7 March 2012 |df=dmy-all |last1=Staff |first1=Spiegel }}</ref>

Experts{{mdash}}including Helle Lykke Nielsen{{mdash}}who have examined the dossier said that it was broadly accurate from a technical point of view but contained a few falsehoods and could easily have misled people not familiar with Danish society, an assessment which the imams have since agreed to.<ref name="hansen&hundevadt" />{{Rp|80-4}} Some mistakes were that Islam is not officially recognised as a religion in Denmark (it is); that the cartoons are the result of a contest; and that [[Anders Fogh Rasmussen]] in his role as Prime Minister gave a medal to [[Ayaan Hirsi Ali]] (he gave one in his capacity as party leader of the [[Venstre (Denmark)|Liberal Party]]). 

The imams also claimed to speak on behalf of 28 organisations, many of which later denied any connection to them.<ref name="hansen&hundevadt" />{{Rp|81}} Additions such as the "pig" photograph may have polarised the situation (the association of a person and a pig is considered very insulting in Islamic culture), as they were confused for the cartoons published in the newspaper.<ref name="responsibilities" /> Muslims who met with the group later said Akkari's delegation had given them the impression that Danish Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen somehow controlled or owned ''Jyllands-Posten''.<ref name="clash" />

[[Naser Khader]], a Muslim Danish MP, founded an organisation called [[Democratic Muslims in Denmark]] in response to the controversy. He was worried that what he believed to be Islamists were seen to speak for all Muslims in Denmark. He said that there is still a sharp division within the Danish Muslim community between Islamists and moderates, and that Denmark had become a target for Islamists. He said that some good came from the crisis because "the cartoon crisis made clear that Muslims are not united and that there is a real difference between the Islamists and people like myself. Danes were shown that talk of 'the Muslims' was too monolithic." He also said that the crisis served as a wake-up call about radical Islam to European countries.<ref name=Pipesinterview>{{cite journal |last=Pipes |first=Daniel |title=Naser Khader and Flemming Rose: Reflections on the Danish Cartoon Controversy |journal=[[Middle East Quarterly]] |date=Fall 2007 |volume=XIV |issue=4 |pages=59–66 |url=http://www.meforum.org/1758/naser-khader-and-flemming-rose-reflections-on |accessdate=18 October 2012 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120920205949/http://www.meforum.org/1758/naser-khader-and-flemming-rose-reflections-on |archive-date=20 September 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

Still a practising Muslim, he said that printing the cartoons was ok and he personally apologised to the cartoonist Westergaard. Westergaard responded by saying "I met a man who has converted from being an Islamist to become a humanist who understands the values of our society. To me, he is really sincere, convincing and strong in his views." A spokesman for the Islamic Society of Denmark said "It is still not OK to publish drawings of Muhammad.

{{Main|Aniconism in Islam|Depictions of Muhammad}}

The [[Qur'an]] condemns idolatry, and this has led some Islamic scholars to interpret it as prohibiting figurative representation; this is known as [[aniconism]]. However, since Islam has many centres of religious authority, opinion and tradition about this is not uniform.<ref name=Esposito>{{cite book |last=Esposito |first=John L. |title=What Everyone Needs to Know about Islam |year=2011 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-979413-3 |pages=14–15 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xnN6wvw8zVQC&pg=PA15 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160506193700/https://books.google.com/books?id=xnN6wvw8zVQC&pg=PA15#v=onepage&q&f=false |archive-date=6 May 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>  In popular practice today there is no general injunction against pictorial representation of people outside of religious contexts.<ref>Klausen 2009. p.&nbsp;139–140.</ref> Generally, images of Muhammad have been prohibited throughout history.

==== Insulting Muhammad ====
In Muslim societies, insulting Muhammad is considered one of the gravest of all crimes. According to Ana Belen Soage of the [[University of Granada]], "The Islamic sharî'a has traditionally considered blasphemy punishable by death, although modern Muslim thinkers such as [[Mohammad Hashim Kamali]] maintain that, given that the Quran does not prescribe a punishment, determining a penalty is left to the judicial authorities of the day."<ref name=Soage>{{cite journal |last=Soage |first=Ana Belen |title=The Danish Caricatures Seen from the Arab World |journal=Totalitarian Movements and Political Religions |year=2006 |volume=7 |series=3 |pages=363–369 |doi=10.1080/14690760600819523 |issue=3|doi-access=free }}</ref>  In the Quran itself, "God often instructs Muhammad to be patient to those who insult him and, according to historical records, no action was taken against them during his years in Mecca." <ref name=Soage /> Many Muslims said their anti-cartoon stance is against insulting pictures and not so much as against pictures in general.

Peter Hervik said that the cartoon controversy should be seen in the context of an increasingly politicised media environment in Denmark since the 1990s, increasingly negative coverage of Islam and the Muslim minority in Denmark, anti-Muslim rhetoric from the governing political parties, and government policies such as restrictions on immigration and the abolishment of the Board for Ethnic Equality in 2002.<ref name=Hervik>{{cite book |last=Hervik |first=Peter |title=The Annoying Difference: The Emergence of Danish Neonationalism, Neoracism, and Populism in the Post-1989 World |year=2011 |publisher=Berghahn Books |isbn=978-0-85745-100-2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BivtnsLX5FgC}}</ref> Hervik said these themes are often ignored in international coverage of the issue and that they render conclusions that ''Jyllands-Posten'' and the Danish government were innocent victims in a dispute over freedom of speech inaccurate.<ref name=Hervik /> Against this background, Danish Muslims were particularly offended by the cartoons because they reinforced the idea that Danes stigmatize all Muslims as terrorists and do not respect their religious beliefs.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Müller |first1=Marion G. |last2=Özcan |first2=Esra |title=The Political Iconography of Muhammad Cartoons: Understanding Cultural Conflict and Political Action |journal=PS: Political Science and Politics |date=April 2007 |volume=40 |issue=2 |series=2 |doi=10.1017/S104909650707045X |at=290}}</ref>

Danish Muslim politician Naser Khader said, "Muslims are no more discriminated against in Denmark than they are elsewhere in Europe&nbsp;... Generally, Danes give you a fair shake.

The incident occurred at a time of unusually strained relations between the Muslim world and the West.

===== Cartoons as a political tool in the West =====

Some commentators see the publications of the cartoons as part of a deliberate effort to show Muslims and Islam in a bad light, thus influencing public opinion in the West in aid of various political projects.<ref>{{cite news |date=23 March 2006 |title=Islam and globanalisation |newspaper=Al-Ahram |url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2006/787/cu4.htm |last=Dabashi |first=Hamid |accessdate=17 September 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130625133913/http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2006/787/cu4.htm |archive-date=25 June 2013 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> Journalist Andrew Mueller wrote, "I am concerned that the ridiculous, disproportionate reaction to some unfunny sketches in an obscure Scandinavian newspaper may confirm that&nbsp;...

{{quote|the critique of 'Muslim fundamentalism' has become a cornerstone in the definition of European identities. As well as replacing anti-communism as the rallying point for a broad 'democratic consensus' (and, in this shift, remaking this consensus), the critique of Islamic fundamentalism has also become a conduit for imagining Europe as a moral community beyond the nation. It has emerged as a banner under which the most diverse sectors of society can unite in the name of 'European' values.}}

However, Aurel Sari has since said that the special rapporteur's interpretation was wrong and that "neither the decision to commission images depicting the Prophet in defiance of Islamic tradition, nor the actual content of the individual cartoons can be regarded as racist within the meaning of the relevant international human rights instruments" although "some of the more controversial pictures may nevertheless be judged 'gratuitously offensive' to the religious beliefs of Muslims in accordance with the applicable case-law of the European Court of Human Rights."

Many Muslims saw the cartoons as a sign of lack of education about Islam in Denmark and in the West. Egyptian preacher and television star [[Amr Khaled]] urged his followers to take action to remedy supposed Western ignorance, saying, "It is our duty to the prophet of God to make his message known&nbsp;...

He supported calls for a UN resolution that "categorically prohibits affronts to prophets{{mdash}}to the prophets of the Lord and His messengers, to His holy books, and to the religious holy places". He also castigated governments around the world for inaction on the issue, saying, "Your silence over such crimes, which offend the Prophet of Islam and insult his great nation, is what begets violence, generates terrorism, and makes the terrorists say: Our governments are doing nothing, and we must avenge our Prophet ourselves. This is what creates terrorism and begets violence."<ref>{{cite web |title=Special Dispatch No.1089: Sheikh Al-Qaradhawi Responds to Cartoons of Prophet Muhammad: Whoever is Angered and Does Not Rage in Anger is a Jackass – We are Not a Nation of Jackasses |url=http://www.memri.org/report/en/0/0/0/0/0/0/1604.htm |work=Jihad & Terrorism Studies Project |publisher=[[MEMRI]] |accessdate=16 November 2012 |date=9 February 2006 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130109150258/http://www.memri.org/report/en/0/0/0/0/0/0/1604.htm |archive-date=9 January 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

===== Relationship between the Liberal West and Islam =====
{{NPOV section|date=July 2019}}
[[Francis Fukuyama]] wrote in the online magazine ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' that "while beginning with a commendable European desire to assert basic liberal values," the controversy was an alarming sign of the degree of cultural conflict between Muslim immigrant communities in Europe and their broader populations, and advocated a measured and prudent response to the situation.<ref>{{cite news |date=27 February 2006 |last=Fukuyama |first=Francis |title=Europe vs. Radical Islam |newspaper=Slate |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2136964/ |accessdate=17 September 2013 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110907121835/http://www.slate.com/id/2136964/ |archive-date=7 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Helle Rytkonen wrote in ''Danish Foreign Policy Yearbook 2007'' that most of the debate around the cartoon controversy was over-simplified as a simple matter of free speech against religion. She said that the actual dispute was more nuanced, focusing on the tone of the debate and broader context of Western-Islamic relations.<ref>Rytkonen 2007, 106.</ref>

[[Christopher Hitchens]] wrote in ''Slate'' that official reaction in the West{{mdash}}particularly the United States{{mdash}}was too lenient toward the protesters and Muslim community in Denmark, and insufficiently supportive of Denmark and the right to free speech:<ref>{{cite web|title=Stand up for Denmark!|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/fighting_words/2006/02/stand_up_for_denmark.html|last=Hitchens|first=Christopher|date=21 February 2006|work=Slate|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120925164659/http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/fighting_words/2006/02/stand_up_for_denmark.html|archive-date=25 September 2012|accessdate=3 October 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref><blockquote>Nobody in authority can be found to state the obvious and the necessary—that we stand with the Danes against this defamation and blackmail and sabotage.

Let's be sure we haven't hurt the vandals' ''feelings''.</blockquote>[[William Kristol]] also wrote that the response of Western leaders, with the exception of the Danish Prime Minister, was too weak and that the issue was used as an excuse by "those who are threatened by our effort to help liberalize and civilize the Middle East" to fight back against the "assault" on radical Islamists and Middle Eastern dictatorships.<ref>{{cite news |last=Kristol |first=William |title=Oh, the Anguish!

Flemming Rose said he did not expect a violent reaction, and talked about what the incident implies about the relationship between the West and the Muslim world:

{{quote|I spoke to [historian of Islam] Bernard Lewis about this, and he said that the big difference between our case and the Rushdie affair is that Rushdie is perceived as an apostate by the Muslims while, in our case, Muslims were insisting on applying Islamic law to what non-Muslims are doing in non-Muslim countries. In that sense, he said it is a kind of unique case that might indicate that Europe is perceived as some kind of intermediate state between the Muslim world and the non-Muslim world.|author=|title=|source=}}

==== Freedom of speech, political correctness and self-censorship ====

One of the principal lines of controversy surrounding the cartoons concerned the limits of free speech,<ref>Dr. Mohammed Saif-Alden Wattad, [https://web.archive.org/web/20190427145411/http://nujslawreview.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/dr-mohammed-saif-alden-wattad.pdf "ISLAM, TERRORISM AND MODERN LIBERAL SOCIETIES"], ''NUJS LAW REVIEW'', 2010</ref> how much it should be legally or ethically constrained and whether the cartoons were an appropriate expression for a newspaper to print. The cartoons were first printed in response to the perception of some journalists at the newspaper that self-censorship was becoming a problem; the ensuing reaction did nothing to dispel that idea. Rose said:

{{Quote|When I wrote the accompanying text to the publication of the cartoons, I said that this act was about self-censorship, not free speech. Free speech is on the books; we have the law, and nobody as yet has thought of rewriting it.

Rose also highlighted what he believed to be a difference between political correctness and self-censorship{{mdash}}which he considered more dangerous. He said: 

{{Quote|There is a very important distinction to be made here between what you perceive as good behavior and a fear keeping you from doing things that you want to do&nbsp;... A good example of this was the illustrator who refused to illustrate a children's book about the life of Mohammed. He is on the record in two interviews saying that he insisted on anonymity because he was afraid.|author=|title=|source=}}

Christopher Hitchens wrote that it is important to affirm "the right to criticize not merely Islam but religion in general."<ref>{{cite news |last=Hitchens |first=Christopher |title=Cartoon Debate: The Case for Mocking Religion |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/fighting_words/2006/02/cartoon_debate.html |accessdate=4 October 2012 |newspaper=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] |date=4 February 2012 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121010093541/http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/fighting_words/2006/02/cartoon_debate.html |archive-date=10 October 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> He criticised media outlets which did not print the cartoons while covering the story.

Ashwani K. Peetush of [[Wilfrid Laurier University]] wrote that in a liberal democracy freedom of speech is not absolute, and that reasonable limits are put on it such as libel, defamation and hate speech laws in almost every society to protect individuals from "devastating and direct harm." He said that it is reasonable to consider two of the cartoons as hate speech, which directly undermine a group of people (Muslims) by forming part of an established discourse linking all Muslims with terrorism and barbarity:<ref>{{cite journal|last=Peetush|first=Ashwani K.|date=May 2009|title=Caricaturizing Freedom: Islam, Offence, and The Danish Cartoon Controversy|journal=Studies in South Asian Film and Media|volume=1|issue=1|pages=173–188|doi=10.1386/safm.1.1.173_1|df=dmy-all}}</ref> <blockquote>[The cartoons] create a social environment of conflict and intimidation for a community that already feels that its way of life is threatened. I do not see how such tactics incorporate people into the wider public and democratic sphere, as Rose argues. They have the opposite effect: the marginalised feel further marginalised and powerless.</blockquote>In France, satirical magazine ''[[Charlie Hebdo]]'' was taken to court for publishing the cartoons; it was acquitted of charges that it incited hatred.<ref name="Leveque" /> In Canada a human rights commission investigated ''[[The Western Standard]]'', a magazine which published the cartoons, but found insufficient grounds to proceed with a human rights tribunal (which does not imply criminal charges, but is a quasi-judicial, mandatory process) against the publication.<ref>{{cite news |title=Danish cartoon complaint rejected |url=http://www.canada.com/story_print.html?id=bab36f55-6aec-43c6-a458-a49f262fbbb6&sponsor= |accessdate=10 June 2013 |newspaper=National Post |date=7 August 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160324103700/http://www.canada.com/story_print.html?id=bab36f55-6aec-43c6-a458-a49f262fbbb6&sponsor= |archive-date=24 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> These government investigations of journalists catalysed debate about the role of government in censoring or prosecuting expressions they deemed potentially hateful.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Kahn |first=Robert |title=Tragedy, Farce or Legal Mobilization?

Critics said the cartoon controversy was a sign that attempts at judicial codification of such concepts as respect, tolerance and offence have backfired on the West. [[Michael Neumann]] wrote:<ref>{{cite news|last=Neumann|first=Michael|date=13 February 2006|title=Respectful Cultures & Disrespectful Cartoons|newspaper=[[CounterPunch]] News|url=http://www.counterpunch.org/neumann02132006.html|url-status=dead|accessdate=10 June 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110704221619/http://www.counterpunch.org/neumann02132006.html|archive-date=4 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref><blockquote>Western piety has left the West without a leg to stand on in this dispute. It is no good trumpeting rights of free expression, because these rights are now supposed to have nebulous but severe limitations. </blockquote>[[Tim Cavanaugh]] wrote that the incident revealed the danger of hate speech laws:<ref>{{cite news|last=Cavanagh|first=Tim|date=13 February 2006|title=The Mountain Comes to Muhammad|newspaper=[[Reason (magazine)|Reason]]|url=http://www.reason.com/links/links020306.shtml|url-status=dead|accessdate=10 June 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080706151832/http://www.reason.com/links/links020306.shtml|archive-date=6 July 2008|df=dmy-all}}</ref> <blockquote>The issue will almost certainly lead to a revisiting of the lamentable laws against 'hate speech' in Europe, and with any luck to a debate on whether these laws are more likely to destroy public harmony than encourage it.</blockquote>
