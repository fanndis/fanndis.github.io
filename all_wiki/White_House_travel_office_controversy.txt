The '''White House travel office controversy''', sometimes referred to as '''Travelgate''',<ref name="wapoww">[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/whitewater/whitewater.htm "Untangling Whitewater"], ''[[The Washington Post]]'' special report, 2000. Retrieved June 5, 2007.</ref><ref>A [[Google News Archive]] search conducted July 24, 2011, for the years 1993–2010 found about 10,000 hits for "White House" "travel office" and about 6,000 hits for "Travelgate".</ref> was the first major ethics controversy of the [[Clinton administration]]. It began in May 1993, when seven employees of the White House Travel Office were fired. This action was unusual because executive-branch employees usually remain in their posts for many years (even though they can be terminated by, and serve at the pleasure of, the president).

The White House stated the firings were done because financial improprieties in the Travel Office operation during previous administrations had been revealed by an [[FBI]] investigation. Critics contended the firings were done to allow friends of President [[Bill Clinton]] and First Lady [[Hillary Rodham Clinton]] to take over the travel business and that the involvement of the FBI was unwarranted. Heavy media attention forced the White House to reinstate most of the employees in other jobs and remove the Clinton associates from the travel role.

Further investigations by the FBI and the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]], the White House itself, the [[General Accounting Office]], the [[United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform|House Government Reform and Oversight Committee]], and the [[Whitewater (controversy)|Whitewater]] [[Independent Counsel]] all took place over the subsequent years.  Travel Office Director Billy Dale was charged with [[embezzlement]] but found not guilty in 1995. In 1998, Independent Counsel [[Kenneth Starr]] exonerated Bill Clinton of any involvement in the matter.

Hillary Clinton gradually came under scrutiny for allegedly having played a central role in the firings and making false statements about her involvement therein.  In 2000, Independent Counsel [[Robert Ray (prosecutor)|Robert Ray]] issued his final report on Travelgate.  He sought no charges against her, saying that while some of Clinton's statements were factually false, there was insufficient evidence that these statements were either knowingly false or that she understood that her statements led to the firings.

Attention initially focused on the role of the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI), since on May 12, 1993, a week before the firings, associate White House counsel William Kennedy had requested that the FBI look into possible improprieties in the Travel Office operation.<ref name="time060793">George J.

==Investigations==

Retrieved March 23, 2008.</ref> (Later, after a competitive bid, American Express received the permanent role to book press charters.<ref name="wapo022795"/>)

Various investigations took place.

===FBI===
The role of the White House staff in pressuring the FBI to launch an investigation had been heavily criticized; on May 28, 1993, the FBI issued a report saying it had done nothing wrong in its contacts with the White House.<ref name="ray-travel-intro"/>  (This conclusion was reiterated by a March 1994 report by the [[U.S. Department of Justice|Justice Department]]'s [[Office of Professional Responsibility]].<ref name="ray-travel-intro"/>)

Meanwhile, the FBI investigation of the Travel Office practices themselves continued, soon focusing on Dale.<ref name="wapo022795"/>  During the summer of 1993 the other staffers of the office were informed that they were no longer a target of investigation.<ref name="wapo022795"/>

===Clinton White House report===
[[Image:MackMclarty.jpg|right|thumb|upright|[[White House Chief of Staff]] [[Mack McLarty]] took some of the early heat for Travelgate in 1993.]]
On July 2, 1993, the White House issued its own 80-page report on the firings, one that the ''[[New York Times]]'' termed "strikingly self-critical".<ref name="nyt070393">[[Thomas Friedman]], [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE7DE1E30F930A35754C0A965958260 "White House Rebukes 4 In Travel Office Shake-Up"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', July 3, 1993. Retrieved June 30, 2007.</ref>  Co-written by Chief of Staff McLarty, it criticized five White House officials, included McLarty himself, Watkins, Kennedy, Cornelius, and another, for dismissing the Travel Office members improperly, for appearing to pressure the FBI into its involvement, and for allowing friends of the Clintons to become involved in a matter with which they had a business stake.<ref name="nyt070393"/>  It said that the employees should instead have been placed on administrative leave.<ref name="gormley"/>  However, the White House said no illegal actions had occurred, and no officials would be terminated; this did not satisfy Senate Minority Leader [[Bob Dole]], who called for an independent investigation.<ref name="nyt070393"/>  As Chief of Staff McLarty personally apologized to the fired Travel Office employees — some of whom had all their personal documents and travel photographs related to years of service thrown out during the firing process<ref name="cjr-letters"/> — and said they would be given other jobs<ref name="nyt070393"/> (which five of them were;<ref name="pbs011096">[[The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer|Online News Hour]], [https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/whitewater/whitewater_1-10a.html "Close Scrutiny"], [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]], January 10, 1996.

The travel office controversy was subsequently judged to have been a factor in Vince Foster's [[clinical depression|depression]] and July 20, 1993, [[suicide]].<ref name="wapo022795"/><ref name="gormley"/>  In his torn-up resignation note from a few days before, he wrote "No one in The White House, to my knowledge, violated any law or standard of conduct, including any action in the Travel Office. There was no intent to benefit any individual or specific group. [...] The press is covering up the illegal benefits they received from the travel staff".<ref name="nyt081193">[[R. W.

===GAO Report===
In July 1993, Congress requested the non-partisan [[General Accounting Office]] investigate the firings; on May 2, 1994, the GAO concluded that the White House did have legal authority to terminate the Travel Office employees without cause, because they served at the pleasure of the president.<ref name="ray-travel-intro"/>  However, it also concluded that Cornelius, Thomason, and Martens, who all had potential business interests involved, had possibly influenced the decision.<ref name="ray-travel-intro"/>  Moreover, the GAO report indicated that the First Lady played a larger role than previously thought before the firings, with Watkins saying she had urged "that action be taken to get 'our people' into the travel office."<ref name="nyt050394"/>  The First Lady, who had given a written statement to the inquiry, said she did "not recall this conversation with the same level of detail as Mr. Watkins."<ref name="nyt050394"/>

===Independent Counsel investigation begins===
Special prosecutor [[Robert B. Fiske]] tangentially investigated travel office events during the first half of 1994, as part of investigating the circumstances surrounding Foster's death.<ref name="ray-travel-intro"/>

In August 1994, [[Independent Counsel]] [[Kenneth Starr]] took over from Fiske in investigating [[Whitewater (controversy)|Whitewater]], Foster, and indirectly the travel office matter.<ref name="ray-travel-intro"/>  On July 22, 1995, Hillary Clinton gave a deposition under oath to the Independent Counsel that touched on travel office questions;<ref name="ray-travel-hillary">[[Robert Ray (prosecutor)|Robert Ray]], [http://a255.g.akamaitech.net/7/255/2422/13may20041504/icreport.access.gpo.gov/watkins/27-34.pdf "Final Report of the Independent Counsel ... of Matters Related to the White House Travel office" – Mrs. Clinton's Statements Regarding Her Involvement in the Travel Office Firings] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926225913/http://a255.g.akamaitech.net/7/255/2422/13may20041504/icreport.access.gpo.gov/watkins/27-34.pdf |date=2007-09-26 }}, [[United States Government Printing Office]], October 18, 2000.</ref> she denied having had a role in the firings, but was unable to recall many specifics of conversations with Foster and Watkins.<ref name="ray-travel-hillary"/>

[[Image:Kenneth W. Starr.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Independent Counsel [[Kenneth Starr]] exonerated President Clinton with respect to Travelgate, but not the First Lady, in late 1998.]]
Almost two years passed.  Independent Counsel Starr continued his investigation.  Starr wanted access to notes that Vince Foster's attorney took in a conversation with Foster about the travel office affair shortly before Foster's suicide, but on June 25, 1998, the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] ruled 6–3 against Starr in ''[[Swidler & Berlin v.

On November 19, 1998, Starr testified before the [[House Judiciary Committee]] in connection with the [[impeachment of Bill Clinton]] over charges related to the Lewinsky scandal.

Starr explicitly did not exonerate Hillary Clinton, however; her case remained unsettled.  More time passed.  By 2000, she was [[New York United States Senate election, 2000|a candidate for United States Senator from New York]], and Starr had been replaced as Independent Counsel by prosecutor [[Robert Ray (prosecutor)|Robert Ray]], who once worked for [[Rudy Giuliani]], Clinton's then-opponent in the Senate race.<ref name="princeton">[http://www.princeton.edu/~paw/archive_old/PAW99-00/11-0308/0308cns.html "Robert Ray '82 picks up where Ken Starr left off"], [[Princeton University]] class notes, March 8, 2000.

Immediate reactions to the report differed. [[David E.

Opinions would differ over the legacy of the affair.  Some agreed with Safire, who had said that Hillary Clinton was "a vindictive power player who used the FBI to ruin the lives of people standing in the way of juicy patronage."<ref name="cjr-conason"/>  Conservative commentator [[Barbara Olson]] would entitle her highly unflattering 1999&nbsp;book ''Hell to Pay: The Unfolding Story of Hillary Rodham Clinton'', in reference to Clinton's Travelgate phrase.
