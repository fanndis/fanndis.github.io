'''[[Heartland (United States)|Heartland]] rock''' is a genre of rock music characterized by a straightforward, often [[roots rock|roots]] musical style, a concern with farmers, blue-collar working men, and truck drivers of American life, and a conviction that rock music has a social or communal purpose beyond just entertainment.

The genre is exemplified by singer-songwriters [[Tom Petty]], [[Bob Seger]], [[Bruce Springsteen]] and [[John Mellencamp]] and [[country music]] artists, including [[Steve Earle]] and [[Joe Ely]]. The genre developed in the 1970s and reached its commercial peak in the 1980s, when it became one of the best-selling genres in the United States. In the 1990s, many established acts faded and the genre began to fragment, but the major figures have continued to record with commercial success.

==History==
===Origins===
Many major heartland rock artists began their careers in the 1960s, as with [[Bob Seger]], or the 1970s, as with [[Bruce Springsteen]] and [[Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers]]. Springsteen would be the first artist to bring heartland rock to US and international attention,{{cn|date=August 2020}} and is its most commercially successful exponent.{{cn|date=August 2020}} After a series of critically highly regarded, but modestly selling albums with the [[E Street Band]], he achieved his breakthrough in 1975 with ''[[Born to Run]]'',<ref name=RuhlmannSpringsteenAM>{{Citation| last =W. Ruhlmann| title =Bruce Springsteen: Biography| journal =Allmusic| url =https://www.allmusic.com/artist/bruce-springsteen-p5505/biography| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20101229154640/http://www.allmusic.com/artist/bruce-springsteen-p5505/biography| archivedate =December 29, 2010| url-status =dead}}</ref> which presented stories of loss, betrayal, defeat and escape in the context of his native New Jersey shoreline, with songs influenced by 50s [[rock and roll]], [[Bob Dylan]] and Phil Spector's [[Wall of Sound]].<ref>{{Citation| last = J.

These artists included [[Bob Seger|Bob Seger and the Silver Bullet Band]], [[Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers]], and fellow Jersey Shore residents [[Southside Johnny and the Asbury Jukes]].<ref name=RuhlmannSpringsteenAM/> In 1978, Springsteen returned with ''[[Darkness on the Edge of Town]]'', which reached the top ten in the US and then the number one album ''[[The River (Bruce Springsteen album)|The River]]'' (1980), which continued the themes of economic and personal dissolution, produced a series of hit singles,<ref name=RuhlmannSpringsteenAM/> and has been seen as "getting the heartland rock bandwagon rolling", together with the stripped-down sound and darker themes of his next album ''[[Nebraska (album)|Nebraska]]'' (1982).<ref name=Pareles1987/>

===Peak===
[[File:John Mellenkamp.jpg|thumb|right|[[John Mellencamp]], shown in 2007, among the most successful of the "second generation" of acts in the genre]]

===Decline===
In the 1990s, many artists that would have been heartland rockers in the 1980s chose to pursue the recently emerged genre of [[Americana (music)|Americana]],<ref> https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/inside-the-americana-genres-identity-crisis-202818/</ref> and heartland rock dwindled to a few stalwart artists.<ref>{{cite web| url= https://www.allmusic.com/style/heartland-rock-ma0000012246 |title=Hearland rock | accessdate=July 27, 2020}}</ref>
