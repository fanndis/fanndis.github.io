It is sometimes referred to as the Pulitzer of student journalism. ''The Breeze'' was also named the best mid-sized non-daily newspaper in the state of Virginia by the Virginia Press Association for the second year in a row.

==History==


''The Breeze'' started as a four-column, fourpage weekly publication on December 22, 1922 with few illustrations and fewer photos. Today it is a 20-plus page broadsheet newspaper published weekly with full-color photos and graphics. The paper was originally distributed to women on the way out of the dining hall, but currently is distributed to more than 90 locations on and off campus.

=== Origins of the name ===

In 1922, the newly established newspaper for the State Normal School for Women held a contest for suggestions on what to name the new publication.  English teacher Elizabeth P. Cleveland suggested the name “The Breeze” saying that, “nothing here strikes a stranger quite so strongly as our mountain breeze. It is both inspiring and stimulating. It is full of pep, but clean. It clears the cobwebs from the brain and sweeps morbidness from the heart.”  

“The Breeze” won the contest, barely beating out “The Campus Cat” by a coin toss. Cleveland was awarded $2 for her entry.

===Best of the Burg===
Every year in the spring ''The Breeze'' prints a special section of the newspaper titled "Best of the Burg." Readers are encouraged to vote online for the "Best of the Burg," which includes their favorite picks for several businesses in the Harrisonburg area.
