The '''United States dollar''' ([[Currency symbol|symbol]]: '''{{Dollar sign|usd|lk=on}}'''; [[ISO 4217|code]]: '''USD'''; also abbreviated '''US$''' to distinguish it from other dollar-denominated currencies; referred to as the '''dollar''', '''U.S. dollar''', or '''American dollar''') is the official [[currency]] of the [[United States]] and its [[territories of the United States|territories]] per the [[Coinage Act of 1792]]. One dollar is divided into 100 [[cent (currency)|cents]] (symbol: [[Coins of the United States dollar|¢]]), or into 1000 [[mill (currency)|mills]] for accounting and taxation purposes (symbol: ₥). The Coinage Act of 1792 created a [[Decimalisation|decimal currency]] by creating the [[Dime (United States coin)|dime]], [[Nickel (United States coin)|nickel]], and [[Penny (United States coin)|penny]] coins, as well as the [[Dollar coin (United States)|dollar]], [[Half dollar (United States coin)|half dollar]], and [[Quarter (United States coin)|quarter dollar]] coins, all of which are still [[United States Mint|minted]] in 2020.

Several [[Series (United States currency)|forms of paper money]] were introduced by [[United States Congress|Congress]] over the years, the latest of which being the [[Federal Reserve Note]] that was authorized by the [[Federal Reserve Act of 1913]]. While all existing U.S. currency remains [[legal tender]],<ref>{{cite web |title=FAQs |url=https://www.federalreserve.gov/faqs/currency_12768.htm |publisher=BOARD OF GOVERNORS of the FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM |accessdate=3 January 2020 |date=8 October 2013 |quote=All U.S. currency remains legal tender, regardless of when it was issued.}}</ref> issuance of the previous form of the currency ([[United States Note|U.S. notes]]) was discontinued in January 1971.<ref>{{cite web |title=Legal Tender Status |url = https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/faqs/Currency/Pages/legal-tender.aspx |website=U.S. DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY |access-date=3 January 2020 |date=4 Jan 2011 |quote=United States notes serve no function that is not already adequately served by Federal Reserve notes. As a result, the Treasury Department stopped issuing United States notes, and none have been placed into circulation since January 21, 1971.}}</ref> As a result, paper money that is in current [[Currency in circulation|circulation]] consists primarily of Federal Reserve Notes that are [[#Banknotes|denominated]] in U.S. dollars.<ref>{{USC|12|418}}</ref>

A few countries use the Federal Reserve Notes for paper money while still minting their own coins, or also accepting [[Dollar coin (United States)|U.S. dollar coins]] (such as the [[Sacagawea dollar|Sacagawea]] or [[Presidential $1 Coin Program|Presidential dollar]]). As of January 31, 2019, there is approximately {{US$|1.7 [[trillion]]}} in circulation, {{US$|1.65 trillion|long=no}} of which is in the Federal Reserve Notes (the remaining {{US$|50 billion|long=no}} is in the form of [[United States Note|U.S. notes]] and [[Coins of the United States dollar|coins]]).<ref>{{cite web |url = https://www.federalreserve.gov/faqs/currency_12773.htm |title = How much U.S. currency is in circulation? |publisher=Federal Reserve |access-date=May 10, 2019 }}</ref>

The U.S. dollar as a currency is sometimes referred to as the ''[[Greenback (1860s money)|greenback]]'' by [[Foreign exchange market|foreign exchange]] traders and the financial press in other countries, such as [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], [[South Africa]], and [[India]], due to the banknotes' predominantly green color.<ref name=forex>{{cite web |url = http://forex.tradingcharts.com/glossary/Forex%2BTerminology/Greenback%2B.html|website=Forex trading charts BV|title=Definition of "Greenback " in Forex Trading |access-date=7 July 2019}}</ref><ref name=BI>{{cite web |url = https://www.businessinsider.com.au/fx-currency-aud-australia-dollar-fed-trade-war-china-2019-6 |title=The Australian dollar is grinding higher as expectations for rate cuts from the US Federal Reserve build |first=David|last=Scutt|website=Business Insider|date =3 June 2019|access-date=7 August 2019}}</ref><ref name=MW>{{cite web |website=MarketWatch|url=https://www.marketwatch.com/story/dollar-higher-ahead-of-data-new-zealand-currency-at-lowest-since-2016-2018-08-09|title=New Zealand dollar leads G-10 losers as greenback gains strengt|first=Anneken|last= Tappe|date=9 August 2018|access-date=7 August 2019}}</ref><ref name=Reuters>{{cite news |website=Reuters|url=https://uk.reuters.com/article/safrica-markets/update-1-south-africas-rand-firms-against-greenback-stocks-rise-idUKL5N22F4S|title=UPDATE 1-South Africa's rand firms against greenback, stocks rise|access-date=7 August 2019}}</ref><ref name=BT>{{cite web|url=https://m.businesstoday.in/story/why-rupee-is-once-again-under-pressure/1/339315.htm|website=Business Today|title=Why rupee is once again under pressure|date=22 April 2019|access-date=7 August 2019}}</ref>

==Overview==
[[Article One of the United States Constitution|Article&nbsp;I]], [[Article One of the United States Constitution#Section 8: Powers of Congress|Section&nbsp;8]] of the [[United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution]] provides that [[United States Congress|Congress]] has the power "[t]o [[Coining (mint)|coin money]]."<ref>U.S. Constitution, Article 1, Section 8. [https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articlei#section8 para. 5].</ref> Laws implementing this power are currently codified in [[Title 31 of the United States Code|Title 31]] of the [[United States Code|U.S. Code]], under Section 5112, which prescribes the forms in which the United States dollars should be issued.<ref name=":0">''Denominations, specifications, and design of coins''. {{USC|31|5112}}.</ref> These coins are both designated in the section as "[[legal tender]]" in payment of debts.<ref name=":0" /> The [[Sacagawea dollar]] is one example of the [[List of copper alloys|copper alloy]] dollar, in contrast to the [[American Silver Eagle]] which is pure [[silver]]. Section 5112 also provides for the [[Minting coins|minting]] and [[Money creation|issuance]] of other coins, which have values ranging from [[One-cent coin|one cent]] ([[Penny (United States coin)|U.S. Penny]]) to 100 dollars.<ref name=":0" /> These other coins are more fully described in [[Coins of the United States dollar]].

[[Article One of the United States Constitution#Section 9: Limits on Congress|Article I, Section 9]] of the Constitution provides that "a regular Statement and Account of the Receipts and Expenditures of all public Money shall be published from time to time,"<ref>U.S. Constitution, Article 1, Section 9. [https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articlei#section9 para. 7].</ref> which is further specified by Section 331 of Title 31 of the U.S. Code.<ref>''Reports''. {{USC|31|331}}.</ref> The sums of money reported in the "Statements" are currently expressed in U.S. dollars, thus the U.S. dollar may be described as the [[unit of account]] of the United States.<ref>{{cite web|year=2009|title=Financial Report of the United States Government|url=https://www.gao.gov/financial_pdfs/fy2009/09frusg.pdf|access-date=October 17, 2018|publisher=Department of the Treasury|format=PDF}}</ref> "Dollar" is one of the first words of Section 9, in which the term refers to the [[Spanish dollar|Spanish milled dollar]], a coin that had a [[monetary]] value of 8 [[Spanish customary units|Spanish units]] of currency, or [[Spanish real|''reales'']].

=== The Coinage Act ===
In 1792, the [[2nd United States Congress|U.S. Congress]] passed the [[Coinage Act of 1792|Coinage Act]], of which Section 9 authorized the production of various coins, including:<ref name=":1">[[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]]. 1792. ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20040407164627/http://nesara.org/files/coinage_act_1792.pdf Coinage Act of 1792]''. [[2nd United States Congress|2nd Congress]], 1st Session. Sec. 9, ch. 16. Retrieved 6 June 2020.</ref>{{Rp|248}}<blockquote>{{Smallcaps all|D|OLLARS}} or {{Smallcaps all|U|NITS}}—each to be of the value of a Spanish milled dollar as the same is now current, and to contain three hundred and seventy-one [[grain (unit)|grain]]s and four sixteenth parts of a grain of pure, or four hundred and sixteen grains of standard silver.</blockquote>Section 20 of the Act designates the United States dollar as the [[Currency|unit of currency]] of the United States:<ref name=":1" />{{Rp|250–1}}<blockquote>[T]he money of account of the United States shall be expressed in dollars, or units…and that all accounts in the public offices and all proceedings in the courts of the United States shall be kept and had in conformity to this regulation.</blockquote>

==== Denominations ====
Unlike the Spanish milled dollar, the U.S. dollar has been based upon a [[Decimalisation|decimal system of values]] since the time of the [[Continental Congress]].<ref name="contcongress1">{{cite journal |editor-last=Fitzpatrick |editor-first=John C. |date=1934 |title=TUESDAY, AUGUST 8, 1786. |url= http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/hlaw:@field(DOCID+@lit(jc0317))|journal=Journals of the Continental Congress 1774-1789 |volume=XXXI: 1786 |pages=503–505 |access-date=December 5, 2019 }}</ref> This decimal system was again described in the ''Coinage Act of 1792'', which, in addition to the dollar, officially established the following monetary units, with prescribed weights and composition of gold, silver, or copper for each:<ref>{{cite journal|date=1845|editor-last=Peters|editor-first=Richard|title=SECOND CONGRESS.

* [[mill (currency)|'''mill''']] ('''₥'''), or one-thousandth of a dollar; 
* [[Cent (currency)|'''cent''']] ('''¢'''), or one-hundredth of a dollar; 
* [[Dime (United States coin)|'''dime''']], or one-tenth of a dollar; and 
* [[eagle (United States coin)|'''eagle''']], or ten dollars.

Only ''cents'' are in everyday divisions of the dollar: ''dime'' is used solely as the name of the [[Dime (United States coin)|coin]] with the value of 10¢, while ''eagle is'' largely unknown to the general public.<ref name=":2">{{cite web|date=September 26, 2018|title=Mills Currency|url=https://pastandpresent.com/2018/09/26/mills-currency/|access-date=December 5, 2019|website=Past & Present|publisher=Stamp and Coin Place Blog}}</ref> Though ''mill'' is also relatively unknown, it is sometimes used in matters of [[Tax levy|tax levies]], and [[Gasoline and diesel usage and pricing|gasoline prices]], which are usually in the form of $ΧΧ.ΧΧ9 per [[gallon]] (e.g., $3.599, commonly written as ${{frac|3.59|9|10}}).<ref>{{cite web|last=Langland|first=Connie|date=May 27, 2015|title=What is a millage rate and how does it affect school funding?|url=https://whyy.org/articles/what-is-a-millage-rate-and-how-does-it-affect-school-funding/|access-date=December 5, 2019|website=WHYY|publisher=PBS and NPR}}</ref><ref name=":2" />

When currently issued in circulating form, denominations less than or equal to a dollar are emitted as [[Coins of the United States dollar|U.S. coins]], while denominations greater than or equal to a dollar are emitted as [[Federal Reserve Note]]s (with the exception of [[Gold coin|gold]], [[Silver coin|silver]], [[Platinum coin|platinum]], and [[palladium coin]]s valued up to $100 as legal tender, though worth far more as [[bullion]]). Both one-dollar coins and notes are produced today, although the note form is significantly more common.

In the past, "[[paper money]]" was occasionally issued in denominations less than a dollar ([[fractional currency]]) and gold coins were issued for [[circulation (currency)|circulation]] up to the value of $20 (known as the ''[[double eagle]]'', discontinued in the 1930s). The term ''[[Eagle (United States coin)|eagle]]'' was used in the ''Coinage Act of 1792'' for the denomination of ten dollars, and subsequently was used in naming gold coins. Paper currency less than one dollar in denomination, i.e. fractional currency, was also sometimes pejoratively referred to as ''[[shinplaster]]s''.

In 1854, [[Secretary of the Treasury]] [[James Guthrie (American politician)|James Guthrie]] proposed creating $100, $50, and $25 gold coins, to be referred to as a ''[[Union (United States coin)|union]]'', ''[[half union]]'', and ''quarter union'', respectively,<ref>Mehl, B. Max. "United States $50.00 Gold Pieces, 1877", in ''Star Rare Coins Encyclopedia and Premium Catalogue'' (20th edition, 1921)</ref> thus implying a denomination of 1 Union = $100. However, no such coins were ever struck, and only patterns for the $50 half union exist.

Today, USD notes are made from [[Cotton paper|cotton fiber paper]], as opposed to [[Wood fibre|wood fiber]], which is most often used to make common paper. U.S. coins are produced by the [[United States Mint|U.S. Mint]]. USD [[banknote]]s are printed by the [[Bureau of Engraving and Printing]] and, since 1914, have been issued by the [[Federal Reserve]]. The "[[large-sized note]]s" issued before 1928 measured {{convert|7.42 x 3.125|in|mm|abbr=on}}, while [[small-sized note]]s introduced that year measure {{convert|6.14 x 2.61 x 0.0043|in|mm|abbr=on}}.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}

When the current, smaller sized U.S. currency was introduced it was referred to as ''Philippine-sized currency'', as the [[Philippines]] had previously adopted the same size for its legal currency, the [[Philippine peso]].{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}

==Etymology==
{{Further|Dollar}}

In the 16th century, Count [[Hieronymus Schlick]] of [[Bohemia]] began minting coins known as ''joachimstalers'', named for [[Jáchymov|Joachimstal]], the valley in which the silver was mined. In turn, the valley's name is titled after [[Joachim|Saint Joachim]], whereby ''thal'' or ''tal'', a cognate of the English word {{Wikt-lang|en|dale}}, is [[German language|German]] for 'valley.'<ref name="NatGeo">"Ask US." ''[[National Geographic]]''. June 2002. p. 1.</ref> The ''joachimstaler'' was later shortened to the German ''[[Thaler|taler]]'', a word that eventually found its way into many languages, including:<ref name="NatGeo" />

* [[Danish language|Danish]] and [[Swedish language|Swedish]] as ''daler'';
* [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] as ''dalar'' and ''daler'';
* [[Dutch language|Dutch]] as ''daler'' or ''daalder''; 
* [[Ethiopia]]n as ''[[Ethiopian talari|talari]]'';
* [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] as ''tallér'';
* Italian as ''tallero''; 
* [[Arabic language|Arabic]] as ''دولار''; and
* [[English language|English]] as ''[[dollar]]''.


Alternatively, ''thaler'' is said to come from the German coin ''[[guldengroschen]]'' ('great guilder', being of silver but equal in value to a gold guilder), minted from the silver of Joachimsthal. The coins minted in the valley soon lent their name to other coins of similar size and weight from other places. The Dutch coin depicting a lion, for instance, was thus named ''[[leeuwendaalder|leeuwendaler]]'' ('lion dollar'). The ''leeuwendaler'' was authorized to contain 427.16 grains of .75 [[fine silver]] and passed locally for between 36 and 42 [[stuiver]]s. Being lighter than the large-denomination coins then in circulation, it was more advantageous for Dutch merchants to pay foreign debt in leeuwendalers, therefore making such the coin of choice for [[foreign trade]].

The ''leeuwendaler'' was popular in the [[Dutch East Indies]] and in the Dutch North American [[New Netherland|New Netherland Colony]] (today the [[New York metropolitan area]]), and circulated throughout the [[Thirteen Colonies]] during the 17th and early 18th centuries. It was also separately popular throughout [[Eastern Europe]], where it led to the current [[Romanian leu|Romanian]] and [[Moldovan leu|Moldovan currency]], ''leu'' ('lion').

Among the English-speaking community, the Dutch coin came to be popularly known as ''lion dollar''—what would become the origin of the English ''dollar''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://coins.lakdiva.org/netherlands/1644_wes_lion_daalder_ag.html |title=Dutch Colonial&nbsp;– Lion Dollar |publisher=Coins.lakdiva.org |accessdate=October 17, 2018}}</ref> The modern [[American English|American-English]] pronunciation of ''dollar'' is still remarkably close to the 17th-century Dutch pronunciation of ''daler''.<ref name="etymologiebank.nl">{{cite web|url=http://www.etymologiebank.nl/trefwoord/dollar |title=etymologiebank.nl |publisher=etymologiebank.nl |accessdate=October 17, 2018}}</ref> By [[analogy]] with this lion dollar, Spanish pesos—with the same weight and shape as the lion dollar—came to be known as [[Spanish dollar|''Spanish'' ''dollars'']].<ref name="etymologiebank.nl" /> By the mid-18th century, the lion dollar had been replaced by the Spanish dollar, famously known as the 'piece of eight,' which was distributed widely in the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish colonies of the New World]] and in the [[Philippines]].<ref name="nqteor">{{cite journal|last=Julian|first=R.W.|year=2007|title=All About the Dollar|journal=Numismatist|page=41}}</ref>
Eventually, ''dollar'' became the name of the official American currency.

===Nicknames===
{{see also|Slang terms for money#United States}}

==== Dollars in general ====
The [[colloquialism]] ''[[Wikt:buck|'''buck(s)''']]'' (much like the British ''quid'' for the [[pound sterling]]) is often used to refer to dollars of various nations, including the U.S. dollar. This term, dating to the 18th century, may have originated with the colonial [[leather]] trade, or it may also have originated from a [[poker]] term.<ref>{{cite dictionary |title=Buck |dictionary=Online Etymology Dictionary |url=https://www.etymonline.com/search?q=buck |accessdate=October 17, 2018 }}</ref> Likewise, the [[United States one-dollar bill|$1 note]] has been nicknamed '''''buck''''', as well as '''''single'''''.

[[United States Note|'''''Greenback''''']] is another nickname, originally applied specifically to the 19th-century [[Demand Note]] dollars, which were printed black and green on the back side, created by [[Abraham Lincoln]] to finance the [[Union (American Civil War)|North]] for the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Paper Money Glossary |publisher=Littleton Coin Company |url=https://www.littletoncoin.com/shop/Glossaries-Paper-Money |accessdate=October 17, 2018 }}</ref> It is still used to refer to the U.S. dollar (but not to the dollars of other countries). The term ''greenback'' is also used by [[Foreign exchange market|foreign exchange]] traders in reference to the U.S. dollar as a currency,<ref name="forex" /> and by the financial press in other countries, such as [[Australia]],<ref name="BI" /> [[New Zealand]],<ref name="MW" /> [[South Africa]],<ref name="Reuters" /> and [[India]].<ref name="BT" />

Other well-known names of the dollar as a whole in denominations include '''''greenmail''''', '''''green''''', and '''''dead presidents''''', the latter of which referring to the deceased presidents pictured on most bills. Dollars in general have also been known as '''''bones''''' (e.g. "twenty bones" = $20). The newer designs, with portraits displayed in the main body of the obverse (rather than in [[Cameo (carving)|cameo]] insets), upon paper color-coded by denomination, are sometimes referred to as '''''bigface''''' notes or '''''[[Monopoly (game)|Monopoly]] money'''''.

'''''[[Piastre]]''''' was the original French word for the U.S. dollar, used for example in the French text of the [[Louisiana Purchase]]. Calling the dollar a ''piastre'' is still common among the speakers of [[Cajun French]] and [[New England French]]. Modern French uses ''dollar'' for this unit of currency as well. The term is still used as slang for U.S. dollars in the [[French West Indies#French Caribbean|French-speaking Caribbean]] islands, most notably [[Haiti]].

==== Specific to denomination ====
The infrequently-used [[United States two-dollar bill|$2 note]] is sometimes called '''''deuce''''', '''''Tom''''', or '''''Jefferson''''' (after [[Thomas Jefferson]]). Contrastly, the [[United States five-dollar bill|$5 bill]] has been called '''''Lincoln''''', '''''fin''''', '''''fiver''''', and '''''five-spot'''''. The [[United States fifty-dollar bill|$50 bill]] is occasionally called a '''''yardstick''''', or a '''''grant''''', after President [[Ulysses S. Grant]], pictured on the [[Obverse and reverse|obverse]]. The $20 note has been referred to as a '''''double sawbuck''''', '''''Jackson''''' (after [[Andrew Jackson]]), and '''''[[double eagle]]'''''. The $10 note can be referred to as a '''''sawbuck''''', '''''ten-spot''''', or '''''Hamilton''''' (after [[Alexander Hamilton]]).

'''''Benjamin''''', '''''Benji''''', '''''Ben''''', or '''''Franklin''''', refers to the [[United States one-hundred-dollar bill|$100 bill]], which features the likeness of the eponymous [[Benjamin Franklin]]. Other nicknames include '''''C-note''''' (C being the [[Roman numerals|Roman numeral]] for 100), '''''century note''''', and '''''bill''''' (e.g. ''two bills'' = $200).

A ''[[1000 (number)#In popular culture|'''grand''']]'' (sometimes shortened to simply '''''G''''') is a common term for the amount of $1,000, though the thousand-dollar note is no longer in general use. The suffix '''''K''''' or ''k'' (from [[kilo-|''kilo'']]) is also commonly used to denote this amount (e.g. $10k = $10,000). Likewise, a '''''large''''' or '''''stack''''' usually references to a multiple of 1,000 (e.g. "fifty large" = $50,000).

==Dollar sign==
{{Main|Dollar sign}}

[[File:Potosi Real.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Spanish real|Spanish silver ''real'']] or [[peso]] of 1768]]

The symbol {{Dollar sign|US|lk=on}}, usually written before the numerical amount, is used for the U.S. dollar (as well as for many other currencies). The sign was the result of a late 18th-century evolution of the [[scribal abbreviation]] '''''p<sup>s</sup>''''' for the [[peso]], the common name for the [[Spanish dollars]] that were in wide circulation in the [[New World]] from the 16th to the 19th centuries. These Spanish pesos or dollars were minted in [[Spanish America]], namely in [[Mexico City]]; [[Potosí]], Bolivia; and [[Lima]], Peru. The '''''p''''' and the '''''s''''' eventually came to be written over each other giving rise to '''''$'''''.<ref>[[Florian Cajori|Cajori, Florian]] ([1929]1993).

Another popular explanation is that it is derived from the [[Pillars of Hercules]] on the [[Coat of arms of Spain|Spanish Coat of arms]] of the [[Spanish dollar]]. These [[Pillars of Hercules]] on the silver Spanish dollar coins take the form of two vertical bars ('''||''') and a swinging cloth band in the shape of an '''''S'''''.

Yet another explanation suggests that the dollar sign was formed from the capital letters '''''U''''' and '''''S''''' written or printed one on top of the other. This theory, popularized by novelist [[Ayn Rand]] in ''[[Atlas Shrugged]]'',<ref>Rand, Ayn. [1957] 1992. ''[[Atlas Shrugged]]''. [[Signet Press|Signet]]. p. 628.</ref> does not consider the fact that the symbol was already in use before the formation of the United States.<ref>{{cite book | last = James | first = James Alton | title = Oliver Pollock: The Life and Times of an Unknown Patriot | publisher = Books for Libraries Press | year = 1970 | orig-year = 1937 | location = Freeport | page = 356 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kht_DEllNccC | isbn = 978-0-8369-5527-9}}</ref>

The American [[Dollar coin (United States)|dollar coin]] was initially based on the value and look of the [[Spanish dollar]] or ''piece of eight'', used widely in [[Spanish America]] from the 16th to the 19th centuries. The first dollar coins issued by the [[United States Mint]] (founded 1792) were similar in size and composition to the Spanish dollar, minted in Mexico and Peru. The Spanish, U.S. silver dollars, and later, Mexican silver pesos circulated side by side in the United States, and the Spanish dollar and Mexican peso remained legal tender until the [[Coinage Act of 1857]]. The coinage of various English colonies also circulated. The [[lion dollar]] was popular in the Dutch New Netherland Colony (New York), but the lion dollar also circulated throughout the English colonies during the 17th century and early 18th century. Examples circulating in the colonies were usually worn so that the design was not fully distinguishable, thus they were sometimes referred to as "dog dollars".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://coins.nd.edu/ColCoin/ColCoinIntros/Lion-Dollar.intro.html |title=The Lion Dollar: Introduction |publisher=Coins.nd.edu |accessdate=October 17, 2018}}</ref>

On the 6th of July 1785, the [[Continental Congress]] resolved that the money unit of the United States, the dollar, would contain 375.64 [[Grain (unit)|grains]] of fine silver; on the 8th of August 1786, the Continental Congress continued that definition and further resolved that the money of account, corresponding with the division of coins, would proceed in a [[Decimalisation|decimal ratio]], with the sub-units being mills at 0.001 of a dollar, cents at 0.010 of a dollar, and dimes at 0.100 of a dollar.<ref name="contcongress1"/>

After the adoption of the [[United States Constitution]], the U.S. dollar was defined by the Coinage Act of 1792, which specified a "dollar" to be based in the Spanish milled dollar and of 371 [[grain (unit)|grain]]s and 4 sixteenths part of a grain of pure or {{convert|416|gr}} of standard silver and an "eagle" to be 247 and 4 eighths of a grain or {{convert|270|gr}} of gold (again depending on purity).<ref>{{cite web|last=Mint|first=U.S.|title=Coinage Act of 1792|url=https://www.usmint.gov/learn/history/historical-documents/coinage-act-of-april-2-1792|publisher=U.S. treasury}}</ref> The choice of the value 371 grains arose from [[Alexander Hamilton]]'s decision to base the new American unit on the average weight of a selection of worn Spanish dollars. Hamilton got the treasury to weigh a sample of Spanish dollars and the average weight came out to be 371 grains. A new Spanish dollar was usually about 377 grains in weight, and so the new U.S. dollar was at a slight discount in relation to the Spanish dollar.

The same coinage act also set the value of an eagle at 10 dollars, and the dollar at {{frac|10}} eagle. It called for 90% silver alloy coins in denominations of 1, {{frac|2}}, {{frac|4}}, {{frac|10}}, and {{frac|20}} dollars; it called for 90% gold alloy coins in denominations of 1, {{frac|2}}, {{frac|4}}, and {{frac|10}} eagles. The value of gold or silver contained in the dollar was then converted into relative value in the economy for the buying and selling of goods. This allowed the value of things to remain fairly constant over time, except for the influx and outflux of gold and silver in the nation's economy.<ref>See [https://www.ecominoes.com/2013/01/the-definitive-inflation-chart.html].</ref>

The early currency of the United States did not exhibit faces of presidents, as is the custom now;<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.oanda.com/currency/iso-currency-codes/USD|title=United States Dollar|publisher=OANDA|accessdate=October 17, 2018}}</ref> although today, by law, only the portrait of a deceased individual may appear on United States currency.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/31/5114|title=Engraving and printing currency and security documents:Article b|publisher=Legal Information Institute|accessdate=December 19, 2013}}</ref> In fact, the newly formed government was against having portraits of leaders on the currency, a practice compared to the policies of European monarchs.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/28312/money-everything-you-ever-wanted-know-about-coin-portraits|title=On the Money: Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About Coin Portraits|author=Matt Soniak|magazine=Mental Floss|date=July 22, 2011|accessdate=October 17, 2018}}</ref> The currency as we know it today did not get the faces they currently have until after the early 20th century; before that "heads" side of coinage used profile faces and striding, seated, and standing figures from Greek and Roman mythology and composite Native Americans. The last coins to be converted to profiles of historic Americans were the dime (1946) and the Dollar (1971).

===Continental currency===

[[File:Continental Currency One-Third-Dollar 17-Feb-76 obv.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|right|Continental one third dollar bill (obverse)]]
{{See also|Continental currency}}
During the [[American Revolution]] the [[thirteen colonies]] became [[sovereignty|independent states]]. Freed from British monetary regulations, they each issued [[£sd]] paper money to pay for military expenses. The [[Continental Congress]] also began issuing "Continental Currency" denominated in Spanish dollars. The dollar was valued relative to the states' currencies at the following rates:
* 5 shillings – [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]
* 6 shillings – [[Connecticut]], [[Massachusetts]], [[New Hampshire]], [[Rhode Island]], [[Virginia]]
* {{frac|7|1|2}} shillings – [[Delaware]], [[Maryland]], [[New Jersey]], [[Pennsylvania]]
* 8 shillings – New York, [[North Carolina]]
* {{frac|32|1|2}} shillings – [[South Carolina]]

Continental currency [[depreciation (currency)|depreciated]] badly during the war, giving rise to the famous phrase "not worth a continental".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Newman|first1=Eric P.|title=The Early Paper Money of America|date=1990|publisher=Krause Publications|location=Iola, Wisconsin|isbn=0-87341-120-X|page=17|edition=3}}</ref> A primary problem was that monetary policy was not coordinated between Congress and the states, which continued to issue bills of credit. Additionally, neither Congress nor the governments of the several states had the will or the means to retire the bills from circulation through taxation or the sale of bonds.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Wright|first1=Robert E.|title=One Nation Under Debt: Hamilton, Jefferson, and the History of What We Owe|date=2008|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York, New York|isbn=978-0-07-154393-4|pages=50–52}}</ref> The currency was ultimately replaced by the silver dollar at the rate of 1 silver dollar to 1000 continental dollars.

===Silver and gold standards===
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2018}}
From 1792, when the [[Mint Act]] was passed, the dollar was defined as 371.25 [[grain (unit)|grains]] (24.056 g) of silver. The gold coins that were minted were not given any denomination and traded for a market value relative to the Congressional standard of the silver dollar. 1834 saw a shift in the [[gold standard]] to {{convert|23.2|gr}}, followed by a slight adjustment to {{convert|23.22|gr}} in 1837 (16:1 ratio).{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}

In 1862, paper money was issued without the backing of precious metals, due to the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. Silver and gold coins continued to be issued and in 1878 the link between paper money and coins was reinstated. This disconnection from gold and silver backing also occurred during the [[War of 1812]]. The use of paper money not backed by precious metals had also occurred under the Articles of Confederation from 1777 to 1788. With no solid backing and being easily counterfeited, the continentals quickly lost their value, giving rise to the phrase "not worth a continental". This was a primary reason for the "No state shall... make any thing but gold and silver coin a tender in payment of debts" clause in [[Article One of the United States Constitution#Section 10: Limits on the States|article 1, section 10]] of the United States Constitution.

In order to finance the [[War of 1812]], Congress authorized the issuance of [[Treasury Note (19th century)|Treasury Note]]s, interest-bearing short-term debt that could be used to pay public dues. While they were intended to serve as debt, they did function "to a limited extent" as money. Treasury Notes were again printed to help resolve the reduction in public revenues resulting from the [[Panic of 1837]] and the [[Panic of 1857]], as well as to help finance the [[Mexican–American War]] and the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].

In addition to Treasury Notes, in 1861, Congress authorized the Treasury to borrow $50&nbsp;million in the form of [[Demand Notes]], which did not bear interest but could be redeemed on demand for precious metals. However, by December 1861, the Union government's supply of specie was outstripped by demand for redemption and they were forced to suspend redemption temporarily. The following February, Congress passed the [[Legal Tender Cases|''Legal Tender Act of 1862'']], issuing [[United States Notes]], which were not redeemable on demand and bore no interest, but were [[legal tender]], meaning that creditors had to accept them at face value for any payment except for public debts and import tariffs. However, silver and gold coins continued to be issued, resulting in the depreciation of the newly printed notes through [[Gresham's Law]]. In 1869, Supreme Court ruled in [[Hepburn v. Griswold]] that Congress could not require creditors to accept United States Notes, but overturned that ruling the next year in the [[Legal Tender Cases]]. In 1875, Congress passed the ''[[Specie Payment Resumption Act]]'', requiring the Treasury to allow US Notes to be redeemed for gold after January 1, 1879. The Treasury ceased to issue United States Notes in 1971.

The ''[[Gold Standard Act]]'' of 1900 abandoned the bimetallic standard and defined the dollar as {{convert|23.22|gr}} of gold, equivalent to setting the price of 1 [[troy ounce]] of gold at $20.67. Silver coins continued to be issued for circulation until 1964, when all silver was removed from dimes and quarters, and the half dollar was reduced to 40% silver. Silver half dollars were last issued for circulation in 1970. Gold coins were confiscated by [[Executive Order 6102]] issued in 1933 by Franklin Roosevelt. The gold standard was changed to {{convert|13.71|gr}}, equivalent to setting the price of 1 troy ounce of gold at $35. This standard persisted until 1968.

Between 1968 and 1975, a variety of pegs to gold were put in place, eventually culminating in a sudden end, on August 15, 1971, to the convertibility of dollars to gold later dubbed the [[Nixon Shock]]. The last peg was $42.22 per ounce{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} before the U.S. dollar was allowed to freely float on [[Foreign exchange market|currency markets]].

According to the [[Bureau of Engraving and Printing]], the largest note it ever printed was the $100,000 Gold Certificate, Series 1934. These notes were printed from December 18, 1934, through January 9, 1935, and were issued by the Treasurer of the United States to Federal Reserve Banks only against an equal amount of gold bullion held by the Treasury. These notes were used for transactions between Federal Reserve Banks and were not circulated among the general public.

==Coins==
{{Main|Coins of the United States dollar}}

Official United States coins have been produced every year from 1792 to the present. From 1934 to present, the only denominations produced for circulation have been the familiar penny, nickel, dime, quarter, half dollar and dollar. The nickel is the only coin still in use today that is essentially unchanged (except in its design) from its original version. Every year since 1866, the nickel has been 75% copper and 25% nickel, except for 4 years during [[World War II]] when nickel was needed for the war.

Due to the penny's low value, some [[Efforts to eliminate the penny in the United States|efforts have been made to eliminate the penny]] as circulating coinage.<ref>{{cite web|author=Christian Zappone|date=July 18, 2006|title=Kill-the-penny bill introduced|url=https://money.cnn.com/2006/07/18/news/penny/index.htm|accessdate=October 17, 2018|website=CNN Money}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Weinberg|first=Ali|date=February 19, 2013|title=Penny pinching: Can Obama manage elimination of one-cent coin?|publisher=[[NBC News]]|url=http://firstread.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/02/19/17019470-penny-pinching-can-obama-manage-elimination-of-one-cent-coin?lite|accessdate=October 17, 2018}}</ref>

Technically, all these coins are still legal tender at face value, though some are far more valuable today for their [[numismatics|numismatic]] value, and for gold and silver coins, their [[precious metal]] value. From 1965 to 1970 the [[Kennedy half dollar]] was the only ''circulating'' coin with any silver content, which was removed in 1971 and replaced with cupronickel. However, since 1992, the U.S. Mint has produced special Silver Proof Sets in addition to the regular yearly proof sets with silver dimes, quarters, and half dollars in place of the standard copper-nickel versions.
In addition, an experimental [[Stella (United States coin)|$4.00 (Stella)]] coin was also minted in 1879, but never placed into circulation, and is properly considered to be a pattern rather than an actual coin denomination.

The $50 coin mentioned was only produced in 1915 for the [[Panama-Pacific International Exposition (1915)]] celebrating the opening of the [[Panama Canal]]. Only 1,128 were made, 645 of which were octagonal; this remains the only U.S. coin that was not round as well as the largest and heaviest U.S. coin ever produced. A $100 gold coin was produced in High relief during 2015, although it was primarily produced for collectors, not for general circulation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.coinnews.net/2015/07/31/2015-100-american-liberty-high-relief-gold-coin-photos/|title=2015 $100 American Liberty High Relief Gold Coin Photos|date=July 31, 2015}}</ref>

====Proof Sets====
The United States Mint produces Proof Sets specifically for collectors and speculators. ''Silver Proofs'' tend to be the standard designs but with the dime, quarter, and half dollar containing 90% silver. Starting in 1983 and ending in 1997, the Mint also produced proof sets containing the year's commemorative coins alongside the regular coins. Another type of proof set is the Presidential Dollar Proof Set where the four special $1 coins are minted each year featuring a president. Because of budget constraints and increasing stockpiles of these relatively unpopular coins, the production of new presidential dollar coins for circulation was suspended on December 13, 2011, by U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner. Presidential dollars (along with all other dollar coin series) minted from 2012 onward were made solely for collectors.<ref>{{cite web|title=The United States Mint Coins and Medals Program|url=https://www.usmint.gov/learn/coin-and-medal-programs|publisher=Department of the Treasury|accessdate=October 17, 2018}}</ref>

===Dollar coins===
{{main|Coins of the United States dollar}}

The first United States dollar was minted in 1794. Known as the [[Flowing Hair Dollar]], it contained 416 [[Grain (mass)|grains]] of "standard silver" (89.25% silver and 10.75% copper), as specified by Section 13<ref>{{cite web|url=http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsl&fileName=001/llsl001.db&recNum=372 |title=Section 13 of the Coinage Act of 1792 |publisher=Memory.loc.gov |accessdate=October 17, 2018}}</ref> of the ''[[Coinage Act of 1792]]''. It was designated by Section 9 of that Act as having "the value of a [[Spanish milled dollar]]."

[[Dollar coin (United States)|Dollar coins]] have not been very popular in the United States.<ref>Anderson, Gordon T. 25 April 2005. "[https://money.cnn.com/2005/04/27/pf/new_dollar/ Congress tries again for a dollar coin]." ''[[CNN Money]].''</ref> [[United States dollar coin|Silver dollars]] were minted intermittently from 1794 through 1935; a copper-nickel dollar of the same large size, featuring President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], was minted from 1971 through 1978. Gold dollars were also minted in the 19th century. The [[Susan B. Anthony]] [[Susan B. Anthony dollar|dollar]] coin was introduced in 1979; these proved to be unpopular because they were often mistaken for quarters, due to their nearly equal size, their milled edge, and their similar color. Minting of these dollars for circulation was suspended in 1980 (collectors' pieces were struck in 1981), but, as with all past U.S. coins, they remain [[legal tender]]. As the number of Anthony dollars held by the Federal Reserve and dispensed primarily to make change in postal and transit vending machines had been virtually exhausted, additional Anthony dollars were struck in 1999. In 2000, a [[Sacagawea dollar|new dollar coin]] featuring [[Sacagawea]] was introduced, which corrected some of the problems of the Anthony dollar by having a smooth edge and a gold color, without requiring changes to vending machines that accept the Anthony dollar. However, this new coin has failed to achieve the popularity of the still-existing dollar bill and is rarely used in daily transactions. The failure to simultaneously withdraw the dollar bill and weak publicity efforts have been cited by coin proponents as primary reasons for the failure of the dollar coin to gain popular support.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gao.gov/new.items/d02896.pdf |title=Report to the Subcommittee on Treasury and General Government, Committee on Appropriations, U.S. Senate |publisher=USGAO |accessdate=October 17, 2018}}</ref>

In February 2007, the [[U.S. Mint]], under the ''[[Presidential $1 Coin Act of 2005]]'',<ref>Pub. L. No. 109-145, 119 Stat. 2664 (December 22, 2005).</ref> introduced a new $1 U.S. presidential dollar coin. Based on the success of the "[[50 State Quarters]]" series, the new coin features a sequence of presidents in order of their inaugurations, starting with [[George Washington]], on the obverse side. The reverse side features the [[Statue of Liberty]]. To allow for larger, more detailed portraits, the traditional inscriptions of "[[E Pluribus Unum]]", "[[In God We Trust]]", the year of minting or issuance, and the mint mark will be inscribed on the edge of the coin instead of the face. This feature, similar to the edge inscriptions seen on the [[One pound (British decimal coin)|British £1]] coin, is not usually associated with U.S. coin designs. The inscription "Liberty" has been eliminated, with the Statue of Liberty serving as a sufficient replacement. In addition, due to the nature of U.S. coins, this will be the first time there will be circulating U.S. coins of different denominations with the same president featured on the obverse (heads) side ([[Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln]]/[[Penny (United States coin)|penny]], [[Thomas Jefferson|Jefferson]]/[[Nickel (United States coin)|nickel]], [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]/[[Dime (United States coin)|dime]], [[George Washington|Washington]]/[[Quarter (United States coin)|quarter]], [[John F. Kennedy|Kennedy]]/[[Half dollar (United States coin)|half dollar]], and [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|Eisenhower]]/[[Dollar coin (United States)|dollar]]). Another unusual fact about the new $1 coin is [[Grover Cleveland]] will have two coins with two different portraits issued due to the fact he was the only U.S. president to be elected to two non-consecutive terms.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.usmint.gov/news/press-releases/20120619-united-states-mint-releases-2012-presidential-1-fourcoin-set-on-june-26 |title=United States Mint Releases 2012 Presidential $1 Four–Coin Set on June 26 |publisher=Usmint.com |date=June 19, 2012 |accessdate=October 17, 2018}}</ref>

Early releases of the Washington coin included [[error coins]] shipped primarily from the Philadelphia mint to Florida and Tennessee banks. Highly sought after by collectors, and trading for as much as $850 each within a week of discovery, the error coins were identified by the absence of the edge impressions "E PLURIBUS UNUM IN GOD WE TRUST 2007 P". The mint of origin is generally accepted to be mostly Philadelphia, although identifying the source mint is impossible without opening a mint pack also containing marked units. Edge lettering is minted in both orientations with respect to "heads", some amateur collectors were initially duped into buying "upside down lettering error" coins.<ref>[http://ap.washingtontimes.com/dynamic/stories/G/GODLESS_DOLLARS Godless Dollars]{{dead link|date=March 2018}}</ref> Some cynics also erroneously point out that the Federal Reserve makes more profit from dollar bills than dollar coins because they wear out in a few years, whereas coins are more permanent. The fallacy of this argument arises because new notes printed to replace worn out notes, which have been withdrawn from circulation, bring in no net revenue to the government to offset the costs of printing new notes and destroying the old ones. As most [[vending machines]] are incapable of making change in [[banknotes]], they commonly accept only $1 bills, though a few will give change in dollar coins.{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}}

The [[Constitution of the United States|U.S. Constitution]] provides that Congress shall have the power to "borrow money on the credit of the United States."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articlei#section8 |title=Paragraph 2 of Section 8 of Article 1 of the United States Constitution |publisher=Topics.law.cornell.edu |accessdate=October 17, 2018}}</ref> Congress has exercised that power by authorizing [[Federal Reserve Banks]] to issue [[Federal Reserve Notes]]. Those notes are "obligations of the United States" and "shall be redeemed in lawful money on demand at the Treasury Department of the United States, in the city of Washington, District of Columbia, or at any Federal Reserve bank".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/12/411 |title=Section 411 of Title 12 of the United States Code |publisher=Law.cornell.edu |date=June 22, 2010 |accessdate=October 17, 2018}}</ref> Federal Reserve Notes are designated by law as "[[legal tender]]" for the payment of debts.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/31/5103 |title=Section 5103 of Title 31 of the United States Code |publisher=Law.cornell.edu |date=August 6, 2010 |accessdate=October 17, 2018}}</ref> Congress has also authorized the issuance of [[Federal Reserve Note|more than 10 other types of banknotes]], including the [[United States Note]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/31/5115 |title=Section 5115 of Title 31 of the United States Code |publisher=Law.cornell.edu |date=August 6, 2010 |accessdate=October 17, 2018}}</ref> and the [[Federal Reserve Bank Note]]. The Federal Reserve Note is the only type that remains in circulation since the 1970s.

Currently printed denominations are [[United States one-dollar bill|$1]], [[United States two-dollar bill|$2]], [[United States five-dollar bill|$5]], [[United States ten-dollar bill|$10]], [[United States twenty-dollar bill|$20]], [[United States fifty-dollar bill|$50]], and [[United States one hundred-dollar bill|$100]]. Notes above the $100 denomination stopped being printed in 1946 and were officially withdrawn from circulation in 1969. These notes were used primarily in inter-bank transactions or by [[organized crime]]; it was the latter usage that prompted President [[Richard Nixon]] to issue an executive order in 1969 halting their use. With the advent of electronic banking, they became less necessary. Notes in denominations of $500, $1,000, $5,000, $10,000, and $100,000 were all produced at one time; see [[large denomination bills in U.S. currency]] for details. With the exception of the $100,000 bill (which was only issued as a Series 1934 Gold Certificate and was never publicly circulated; thus it is illegal to own), these notes are now collectors' items and are worth more than their face value to collectors.

Though still predominantly green, post-2004 series incorporate other colors to better distinguish different denominations. As a result of a 2008 decision in an accessibility lawsuit filed by the [[American Council of the Blind]], the [[Bureau of Engraving and Printing]] is planning to implement a raised tactile feature in the next redesign of each note, except the $1 and the current version of the $100 bill. It also plans larger, higher-contrast numerals, more color differences, and distribution of currency readers to assist the visually impaired during the transition period.<ref>See [[Federal Reserve Note]] for details and references</ref>

==Means of issue==

The monetary base consists of coins and Federal Reserve Notes in circulation outside the Federal Reserve Banks and the U.S. Treasury, plus deposits held by depository institutions at Federal Reserve Banks. The adjusted monetary base has increased from approximately 400&nbsp;billion dollars in 1994, to 800&nbsp;billion in 2005, over 3000&nbsp;billion in 2013.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/BASE/ | title=St. Louis Adjusted Monetary Base | publisher=[[Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis]] | accessdate=October 17, 2018}}</ref> The amount of cash in circulation is increased (or decreased) by the actions of the [[Federal Reserve System]]. Eight times a year, the 12-person [[Federal Open Market Committee]] meets to determine U.S. [[monetary policy]].<ref>{{cite web |publisher=The Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis |title=The Federal Reserve's Beige Book |url=https://www.minneapolisfed.org/publications/the-region/the-federal-reserves-beige-book-a-better-mirror-than-crystal-ball |accessdate=October 17, 2018}}</ref> Every business day, the Federal Reserve System engages in [[Open market operations]] to carry out that monetary policy.<ref>{{cite web |first=Phil |last=Davies |title=Right on Target |url=https://www.minneapolisfed.org/publications/the-region/right-on-target |quote=Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis |accessdate=October 17, 2018}}</ref> If the Federal Reserve desires to increase the money supply, it will buy securities (such as U.S. Treasury Bonds) anonymously from banks in exchange for dollars. Conversely, it will sell securities to the banks in exchange for dollars, to take dollars out of circulation.<ref name="newyorkfed.org">{{cite web |title=Open Market Operations |publisher=Federal Reserve Bank of New York |url=https://www.newyorkfed.org/aboutthefed/fedpoint/fed32.html |quote=Open market operations enable the Federal Reserve to affect the supply of reserve balances in the banking system. |accessdate=October 17, 2018 }}</ref>

When the Federal Reserve makes a purchase, it credits the seller's reserve account (with the Federal Reserve). This money is not transferred from any existing funds—it is at this point that the Federal Reserve has created new [[high-powered money]]. Commercial banks can freely withdraw in cash any excess reserves from their reserve account at the Federal Reserve. To fulfill those requests, the Federal Reserve places an order for printed money from the U.S. Treasury Department.<ref>{{cite web |title=Fact Sheets: Currency & Coins |publisher=United States Department of the Treasury |url=https://www.treasury.gov/about/education/Pages/edu_fact-sheets_currency_index.aspx |accessdate=October 17, 2018 }}</ref> The Treasury Department, in turn, sends these requests to the Bureau of Engraving and Printing (to print new [[Federal Reserve notes|dollar bills]]) and the Bureau of the Mint (to stamp the coins).

Usually, the short-term goal of open market operations is to achieve a specific short-term interest rate target. In other instances, monetary policy might instead entail the targeting of a specific exchange rate relative to some foreign currency or else relative to gold. For example, in the case of the United States the Federal Reserve targets the [[federal funds rate]], the rate at which member banks lend to one another overnight. The other primary means of conducting monetary policy include: (i) [[Discount window]] lending (as [[lender of last resort]]); (ii) Fractional deposit lending (changes in the reserve requirement); (iii) Moral suasion (cajoling certain market players to achieve specified outcomes); (iv) "[[Open mouth operations]]" (talking monetary policy with the market).

The 6th paragraph of [[Coinage clause|Section 8]] of Article 1 of the U.S. Constitution provides that the U.S. Congress shall have the power to "coin money" and to "regulate the value" of domestic and foreign coins. Congress exercised those powers when it enacted the [[Coinage Act of 1792]]. That Act provided for the minting of the [[Flowing Hair Dollar|first U.S. dollar]] and it declared that the U.S. dollar shall have "the value of a [[Spanish milled dollar]] as the same is now current".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsl&fileName=001/llsl001.db&recNum=371 |title=Section 9 of the Coinage Act of 1792 |publisher=Memory.loc.gov |accessdate=August 24, 2010}}</ref>

The table to the right shows the equivalent amount of goods that, in a particular year, could be purchased with $1. The table shows that from 1774 through 2012 the U.S. dollar has lost about 97.0% of its buying power.<ref name="measuring-worth">{{cite web| title = Measuring Worth&nbsp;– Purchasing Power of Money in the United States from 1774 to 2010 | url=https://www.measuringworth.com/calculators/ppowerus/ | accessdate =April 22, 2010}}</ref>

The decline in the value of the U.S. dollar corresponds to [[price inflation]], which is a rise in the general level of prices of goods and services in an economy over a period of time.<ref>[[Olivier Blanchard]] (2000). ''Macroeconomics'' (2nd ed.), Englewood Cliffs, N.J: Prentice Hall, {{ISBN|0-13-013306-X}}</ref> A [[consumer price index]] (CPI) is a measure estimating the average price of consumer goods and services purchased by households.

The value of the U.S. dollar declined significantly during wartime, especially during the [[American Civil War]], World War I, and World War II.<ref>{{cite book | title = [[A Monetary History of the United States|A monetary history of the United States, 1867–1960]] | author = [[Milton Friedman]], [[Anna Jacobson Schwartz]] | isbn=978-0691003542 | page=546 }}</ref> The [[Federal Reserve]], which was established in 1913, was designed to furnish an "elastic" currency subject to "substantial changes of quantity over short periods", which differed significantly from previous forms of [[high-powered money]] such as gold, national bank notes, and silver coins.<ref>Friedman 189–190</ref> Over the very long run, the prior gold standard kept prices stable—for instance, the price level and the value of the U.S. dollar in 1914 was not very different from the price level in the 1880s. The Federal Reserve initially succeeded in maintaining the value of the U.S. dollar and price stability, reversing the inflation caused by the First World War and stabilizing the value of the dollar during the 1920s, before presiding over a 30% deflation in U.S. prices in the 1930s.<ref name="central-banking-then-and-now">{{cite web |url=https://www.minneapolisfed.org/publications/the-region/central-bankingthen-and-now | title = Central Banking—Then and Now | accessdate=October 17, 2018 }}</ref>

Under the [[Bretton Woods system]] established after World War II, the value of gold was fixed to $35 per ounce, and the value of the U.S. dollar was thus anchored to the value of gold. Rising government spending in the 1960s, however, led to doubts about the ability of the United States to maintain this convertibility, gold stocks dwindled as banks and international investors began to convert dollars to gold, and as a result the value of the dollar began to decline. Facing an emerging [[currency crisis]] and the imminent danger that the United States would no longer be able to redeem dollars for gold, gold convertibility was finally terminated in 1971 by [[Richard Nixon|President Nixon]], resulting in the "[[Nixon shock]]".<ref name="inflation-historical-perspective">{{cite web |url=http://www.dallasfed.org/research/swe/1993/swe9304b.pdf |title=Controlling Inflation: A Historical Perspective |accessdate=July 17, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101207041621/http://www.dallasfed.org/research/swe/1993/swe9304b.pdf |archive-date=December 7, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

The value of the U.S. dollar was therefore no longer anchored to gold, and it fell upon the Federal Reserve to maintain the value of the U.S. currency. The Federal Reserve, however, continued to increase the money supply, resulting in [[stagflation]] and a rapidly declining value of the U.S. dollar in the 1970s. This was largely due to the prevailing economic view at the time that inflation and real economic growth were linked (the [[Phillips curve]]), and so inflation was regarded as relatively benign.<ref name="inflation-historical-perspective"/> Between 1965 and 1981, the U.S. dollar lost two thirds of its value.<ref name="measuring-worth"/>

In 1979, [[Jimmy Carter|President Carter]] appointed [[Paul Volcker]] [[Chairman of the Federal Reserve]]. The Federal Reserve tightened the money supply and inflation was substantially lower in the 1980s, and hence the value of the U.S. dollar stabilized.<ref name="inflation-historical-perspective"/>

Over the thirty-year period from 1981 to 2009, the U.S. dollar lost over half its value.<ref name="measuring-worth"/> This is because the Federal Reserve has targeted not zero inflation, but a low, stable rate of inflation—between 1987 and 1997, the rate of inflation was approximately 3.5%, and between 1997 and 2007 it was approximately 2%. The so-called "[[Great Moderation]]" of economic conditions since the 1970s is credited to monetary policy targeting price stability.<ref name="inflation-historical-perspective2">{{cite web |url=https://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/speeches/2005/20051103/default.htm | title = Monetary Credibility, Inflation, and Economic Growth | accessdate=July 17, 2010 }}</ref>

There is ongoing debate about whether central banks should target zero inflation (which would mean a constant value for the U.S. dollar over time) or low, stable inflation (which would mean a continuously but slowly declining value of the dollar over time, as is the case now). Although some economists are in favor of a zero inflation policy and therefore a constant value for the U.S. dollar,<ref name="central-banking-then-and-now"/> others contend that such a policy limits the ability of the central bank to control [[interest rates]] and stimulate the economy when needed.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.frbsf.org/education/teacher-resources/us-monetary-policy-introduction/goals/ | title = U.S. Monetary Policy: The Fed's Goals | accessdate=October 17, 2018 }}</ref>
