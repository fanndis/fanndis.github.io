At an auction held by the Spanish government to sell the mine on 14 February 1873, the group won with a bid of [[Pound sterling|GB£]]3,680,000 ([[Spanish peseta|ESP]] 92,800,000). The bid also specified that Spain would permanently relinquish any right to claim [[royalties]] on the mine's production. Following purchase of the mine, the syndicate launched the Rio Tinto Company, registering it on 29 March 1873.<ref name="Harvey"/> At the end of the 1880s, control of the firm passed to the [[Rothschild family]], who greatly increased the scale of its mining operations.<ref name="Harvey" />{{Rp|188}}

==Operating history==
Following their purchase of the Rio Tinto Mine, the new ownership constructed a number of new processing facilities, innovated new mining techniques, and expanded mining activities.<ref name="Harvey"/>

From 1877 to 1891, the Rio Tinto Mine was the world's leading producer of copper.<ref name="HJStevens">{{Cite book|last=Stevens|first=Horace Jared|title=The Copper Handbook|publisher=Horace J. Stevens|year=1908|volume=8|page=1457}}</ref>
[[Image:Panoramica Corta Atalaya2.jpg|thumb|The open-pit [[Corta Atalaya]] mine was part of Rio Tinto's original operations in Spain.]] From 1870 through 1925, the company was inwardly focused on fully exploiting the Rio Tinto Mine, with little attention paid to expansion or exploration activities outside of Spain. The company enjoyed strong financial success until 1914, [[cartel|colluding with other pyrite producers]] to control market prices. However, World War I and its aftermath effectively eliminated the United States as a viable market for European [[pyrite]]s, leading to a decline in the firm's prominence.<ref name="Harvey"/>

[[Image:Pyrite foolsgold.jpg|thumb|right|[[Pyrite]] was a major product of Rio Tinto's first mines.]]

The company's failure to diversify during this period led to the slow decline of the company among the ranks of international mining firms. However, this changed in 1925, when Sir [[Auckland Geddes, 1st Baron Geddes|Auckland Geddes]] succeeded Lord [[Alfred Milner, 1st Viscount Milner|Alfred Milner]] as chairman. Geddes and the new management team he installed focused on [[diversification (marketing strategy)|diversification]] of the company's investment strategy and the introduction of organizational and marketing reforms. Geddes led the company into a series of joint ventures with customers in the development of new technologies, as well as exploration and development of new mines outside of Spain. Between 1925 and 1931, Geddes recruited two directors: JN Buchanan (finance director) and RM Preston (commercial director), as well as other executives involved with technical and other matters.<ref name="Harvey"/>

Perhaps most significant was the company's investment in copper mines in [[Northern Rhodesia]], later [[Zambia]], which it eventually consolidated into the Rhokana Corporation.<ref name="Harvey"/> These and later efforts at diversification eventually allowed the company to divest from the Rio Tinto mine in Spain. By the 1950s, [[Francisco Franco|Franco]]'s nationalistic government had made it increasingly difficult to exploit Spanish resources for the profit of foreigners.<ref name="Harvey"/> Rio Tinto Company, supported by its international investments, was able to divest two-thirds of its Spanish operations in 1954 and the remainder over the following years.<ref name="RTWeb">{{cite web

==Major mergers and acquisitions==
Like many major mining companies, Rio Tinto has historically grown through a series of mergers and acquisitions.

===Early acquisitions===
[[Image:LocationRhodesia.png|thumb|right|[[Rhodesia]] was the location of Rio Tinto's first major international expansion of mining activities.]]

The company's first major acquisition occurred in 1929, when the company issued stock for the purpose of raising 2.5&nbsp;million pounds to invest in Northern Rhodesian copper mining companies, which was fully invested by the end of 1930.  The Rio Tinto company consolidated its holdings of these various firms under the Rhokana Corporation by forcing the various companies to merge.<ref name="Harvey"/>

Rio Tinto's investment in Rhodesian copper mines did much to support the company through troubled times at its Spanish Rio Tinto operations spanning the [[Spanish Civil War]], [[World War II]], and [[Economic history of Spain#The Franco Era, 1939-75|Franco's nationalistic policies]]. In the 1950s, the political situation made it increasingly difficult for mostly British and French owners to extract profits from Spanish operations, and the company decided to dispose of the mines from which it took its name.<ref name="Harvey"/> Thus, in 1954, Rio Tinto Company sold two-thirds of its stake in the Rio Tinto mines, disposing of the rest over the following years.<ref name="RTWeb"/> The sale of the mines financed extensive exploration activities over the following decade.<ref name="RT-DLC">

===Merger with Consolidated Zinc===
The company's exploration activities presented the company with an abundance of opportunities, but it lacked sufficient capital and operating revenue to exploit those opportunities.  This situation precipitated the next, and perhaps most significant, merger in the company's history.  In 1962, Rio Tinto Company merged with the Australian firm [[Consolidated Zinc]] to form the Rio Tinto – Zinc Corporation (RTZ) and its main subsidiary, Conzinc Riotinto of Australia (CRA). The merger provided Rio Tinto the ability to exploit its new-found opportunities, and gave Consolidated Zinc a much larger asset base.<ref name="RT-DLC"/>

RTZ and CRA were separately managed and operated, with CRA focusing on opportunities within [[Australasia]] and RTZ taking the rest of the world.  However, the companies continued to trade separately, and RTZ's ownership of CRA dipped below 50% by 1986.<ref name="RT-DLC"/> The two companies' strategic needs eventually led to conflicts of interest regarding new mining opportunities, and shareholders of both companies determined a merger was in their mutual best interest. In 1995, the companies merged into a [[dual listed company]], in which management was consolidated into a single entity and shareholder interests were aligned and equivalent, although maintained as shares in separately named entities.  The merger also precipitated a name change; after two years as '''RTZ-CRA''', RTZ became '''Rio Tinto plc''' and CRA became '''Rio Tinto Limited''', referred to collectively as '''Rio Tinto Group''' or simply '''Rio Tinto'''.<ref name="RT-DLC"/>

===Recent mergers, acquisitions, and events===
Major acquisitions following the Consolidated Zinc merger included [[U.S. Borax]], a major producer of [[borax]], bought in 1968,<ref name="RTWeb"/> [[Kennecott Utah Copper]] and BP Australia's coal assets which were bought from [[British Petroleum]] in 1989, and a 70.7% interest in the [[New South Wales]] operations of [[Coal & Allied Industries]], also in 1989.<ref name="RTWeb"/> In 1993, the company acquired [[Nerco]] and  the United States coal mining businesses of [[Cordero Mining Company]].<ref name="RTWeb"/>

In 2011, the company rekindled its interest in potash when it entered a joint venture with [[Acron Group]] to develop the Albany potash development, in southern [[Saskatchewan]], Canada.

On 13 December 2011, an independent arbitrator cleared the way for Rio Tinto, which had owned 49% of [[Turquoise Hill Resources|Ivanhoe Mines]] (now known as Turquoise Hill Resources), to take it over: he said the $16-billion Canadian group's "[[Shareholder rights plan|poison pill]]" defence was not valid.

===Iron ore: Rio Tinto Iron Ore===
Rio Tinto Iron Ore (RTIO) comprises an integrated iron ore operations in the Pilbara, Western Australia. The Pilbara iron ore operations include 16 iron ore mines, four independent port terminals, a 1,700 kilometre rail network and related infrastructure.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.riotinto.com/products/iron-ore|title=Iron Ore|publisher=Rio Tinto|access-date=6 May 2020}}</ref>

Copper was one of Rio Tinto's main products from its earliest days operating at the Rio Tinto complex of mines in Spain.  Since that time, the company has divested itself from its original Spanish mines, and grown its copper-mining capacity through acquisitions of major copper resources around the world.  The copper group's main active mining interests are [[Oyu Tolgoi mine]] in Mongolia, [[Kennecott Utah Copper]] in the United States, and [[Escondida|Minera Escondida]] in Chile. Most of these mines are [[joint venture]]s with other major mining companies, with Rio Tinto's ownership ranging from 30% to 80%; only Kennecott is wholly owned. Operations typically include mining of ore through to production of 99.99% purified copper, including extraction of economically valuable [[byproduct]]s.<ref name="RT-copper">{{cite web

Rio Tinto Copper continues to seek new opportunities for expansion, with major exploration activities at the [[Resolution Copper]] project in the United States, Winu in Australia, and [[Oyu Tolgoi mine|Oyu Tolgoi]] underground mine in Mongolia. In addition, the company is seeking to become a major producer of nickel, with exploration projects currently underway in the United States and Indonesia.<ref name="RT-copper"/>

Although not the primary focus of Rio Tinto Copper's operations, several economically valuable byproducts are produced during the refining of copper ore into purified copper.  Gold, silver, molybdenum, and sulphuric acid are all removed from copper ore during processing. Due to the scale of Rio Tinto's copper mining and processing facilities, the company is also a leading producer of these materials, which drive substantial revenues to the company.<ref name="RT-copper"/>

Sales of copper generated 8% of the company's 2008 revenues, and copper and byproduct operations accounted for 16% of underlying earnings.<ref name="Chartbook"/>
Rio Tinto exclusively provided the metal to produce the 4,700 gold, silver, and bronze medals at the London [[2012 Summer Olympics|2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games]].

Rio Tinto consolidated its aluminium-related businesses into its aluminium product group (originally named ''Rio Tinto Alcan''), formed in late 2007, when Rio Tinto purchased the Canadian company Alcan for $38.1&nbsp;billion. Combined with Rio Tinto's existing aluminium-related assets, the new aluminium division vaulted to the world number-one producer of bauxite, alumina, and aluminium.<ref name="RT-Alum">{{cite web

[[Image:BauxiteUSGOV.jpg|thumb|left|Rio Tinto Alcan is the world's leading producer of bauxite (shown here with a [[Us cent|US cent]] for scale).]]

Rio Tinto divides its Aluminium operations into three main areas – bauxite, alumina and primary metal. The Bauxite and Alumina unit mines raw bauxite from locations in Australia, Brazil, and Africa. The unit then refines the bauxite into alumina at refineries located in Australia, Brazil, Canada, and France. The Primary Metal business unit's operations consist of [[aluminium smelting|smelting aluminium]] from alumina, with smelters located in 11 countries around the world.  The Primary Metal group also operates several power plants to support the energy-intensive smelting process.<ref name="RT-Alum"/>

The aluminium division has interests in seven bauxite mines and deposits, six alumina refineries and six speciality alumina plants, 26 aluminium smelters, 13 [[power plant]]s, and 120 facilities for the manufacture of speciality products.<ref name="RT-Alum"/> The acquisition of Alcan operations in 2007 substantially increased Rio Tinto's asset base, revenues, and profits: in 2008, 41% of company revenues and 10% of underlying earnings were attributable to the aluminium division.<ref name="Chartbook"/>

Rio Tinto Energy is a business group of Rio Tinto dedicated to the mining and sale of [[uranium]]. Rio Tinto's uranium operations are located at two mines: the [[Ranger Uranium Mine]] of [[Energy Resources of Australia]] and the [[Rössing Uranium Mine]] in Namibia.  The company is the third-largest producer of uranium in the world.  According to Rio Tinto's website, the company institutes strict controls and contractual limitations on uranium exports, limiting uses to peaceful, nonexplosive uses only.  Such controls are intended to limit use of the company's uranium production to use as fuel for [[nuclear power plant]]s only, and not for use in the production of [[nuclear weapon]]s.<ref name="RT-uranium">{{cite web

A media report in October 2013 revealed that the corporation plans to establish a fully automated railroad system for the transportation of iron ore across the Australian [[outback]] by 2015, thereby replacing the corporation's train drivers. The United Kingdom-based transport historian Christian Wolmar stated at the same time that the train drivers are most likely the highest-paid members of the occupation in the world at that time. As part of an overall strategy to increase profit margins, the corporation is spending US$518 million on the project.<ref>{{cite news|title=Rio Replacing Train Drivers Paid Like U.S. Surgeons|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-10-02/rio-replacing-train-drivers-paid-like-u-s-surgeons.html|access-date=3 October 2013|newspaper=Bloomberg L.P.|date=3 October 2013|author=Elisabeth Behrmann}}</ref>

==Public impact==
===Involvement with Axis powers in World War II===
Rio Tinto's status as a mainly British-owned company, located in Spain and producing pyrites – an important material for military applications – created a complicated set of circumstances for the company's operation in the 1930s and 1940s. During the Spanish Civil War, the region in which Rio Tinto's mines were located came under the control of [[Francisco Franco|General Franco]]'s Nationalists in 1936.  However, Franco increasingly intervened in the company's operations, at times requisitioning pyrite supplies for use by Spain and its [[Axis powers|Axis]] allies Germany and Italy, forcing price controls on the company's production, restricting exports, and threatening nationalisation of the mines.  Although company management (and indirectly, the British government) managed to counteract some of these efforts by Franco, much of the mine's pyrite production was channelled to Axis powers before and during World War II.  Nonetheless, Franco's meddling caused the mine's production and profitability to fall precipitously during and after the war, leading the company to ultimately exit from its Spanish operations in 1954.<ref name="Kutney">{{Cite book|last=Kutney|first=Dr. Gerald|title=Sulfur: History, Technology, Applications & Industry|publisher=ChemTec Publishing|year=2007|page=260|isbn=9781895198379|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O4rzzkUQyzIC|access-date=9 April 2009}}</ref>

===Criticisms===
====African Iron Ore====
In 2015, Rio Tinto was criticised by the Guinean government for the many mining delays at the local [[Simandou mine]]. Cece Noramou, government official said the government was “running out of patience”. President Alpha Conde himself said that "there have been people at Simandou for 15 years, 20 years, and they’ve never produced a ton of iron".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-10-13/rio-runs-out-of-goodwill-in-guinea-as-giant-iron-ore-mine-lags|title=Rio Runs Out of Guinea Goodwill as Giant Iron-Ore Mine Lags|date=13 October 2015|work=Bloomberg.com|access-date=14 April 2017}}</ref>

In late 2016, Rio Tinto agreed to sell its stake in the Simandou iron ore mine to Chinalco and exit the deal. The deal was negotiated after the company's case against Vale and [[BSG Resources|BSGR]] was dismissed at US District Court.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.mining.com/chinese-buy-worlds-largest-mining-project/|title=Chinese buy world's largest mining project {{!}} MINING.com|date=28 October 2016|work=MINING.com|access-date=14 April 2017|language=en-US}}</ref>

===Environment===
[[Image:Grasberg mine.jpg|thumb|Rio Tinto owns a 40% stake in the Grasberg mine in Indonesia, it has been the focus of environmental concerns. (Photo by Alfindra Primaldhi)]]

==== Mining ====
Rio Tinto has been widely criticised by environmental groups and at least one national government for the environmental impacts of its mining activities. Criticism of the company has focused on its mining methods due to the environmental degradation that results from them, the company's coal operations for their contribution to [[global warming]], and uranium operations for environmental and nuclear technology concerns. 

The most high-level environmental criticism to date has come from the [[government of Norway]], which divested itself from Rio Tinto shares and banned further investment due to environmental concerns. Claims of severe environmental damages related to Rio Tinto's engagement in the [[Grasberg mine]] in Indonesia led [[the Government Pension Fund of Norway]] to exclude Rio Tinto from its investment portfolio. The fund, which is said to be the world's second-largest pension fund, sold shares in the company valued at {{NOK|4.85 billion}} (US$855&nbsp;million) to avoid contributing to environmental damages caused by the company.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.regjeringen.no/en/dep/fin/Press-Center/Press-releases/2008/the-government-pension-fund-divests-its-.html?id=526030&epslanguage=EN-GB| title=The Government Pension Fund divests its holdings in mining company |author=[[Norwegian Ministry of Finance]] |date=9 September 2008 }}</ref>

{{quote|Exclusion of a company from the Fund reflects our unwillingness to run an unacceptable risk of contributing to grossly unethical conduct.

Rio Tinto disputes the claims of environmental damage at the Grasberg mine, and states that the company has long maintained an excellent record on environmental issues.<ref name="BBC-env">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/7608097.stm|title=Norway blacklists miner Rio Tinto|date=10 September 2008|work=BBC News |access-date=9 April 2009}}</ref> 

After the former Panguna copper and gold mine in [[Autonomous Region of Bougainville|Bougainville]], [[Papua New Guinea]], which was abandoned by Rio Tinto in 1989, caused flooding, pollution of water wells, and river poisoning, residents of the region filed a request for investigation with the Australian government in September 2020.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Albeck-Ripka|first=Livia|date=2020-09-30|title=Abandoned Rio Tinto Mine Is Blamed for Poisoned Bougainville Rivers|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/30/world/australia/rio-tinto-abandoned-mine-poison-rivers.html|access-date=2020-09-30|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>

==== Carbon dioxide emissions ====
According to [[The Guardian]], Rio Tinto is one of the top 100 industrial greenhouse gas producers in the world, accounting for 0.75 percent of global industrial greenhouse gas emissions between 1988 and 2015.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2017/jul/10/100-fossil-fuel-companies-investors-responsible-71-global-emissions-cdp-study-climate-change|title=Just 100 companies responsible for 71% of global emissions, study says|last=Riley|first=Tess|date=2017-07-10|work=The Guardian|access-date=2019-09-25|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> In 2016, Rio Tinto estimated to have produced 32 million tonnes of [[carbon dioxide]] equivalent in its own climate change report.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.riotinto.com/documents/RT_Climate_change_report.pdf|title=Climate change report|website=Rio Tinto|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170623165125/http://www.riotinto.com/documents/RT_Climate_change_report.pdf|archive-date=2017-06-23}}</ref>

In March 2018, Rio Tinto was urged by institutional investors to set new rules requiring the company to adhere to the goals of the [[Paris Agreement]] to limit [[global warming]] to 1.5 Celsius, including detailed plans to reduce scope 1 to 3 emissions.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-australia-rio-tinto-emissions/rio-asks-shareholders-to-vote-against-emissions-resolution-idUSKCN1QZ0IJ|title=Rio asks shareholders to vote against emissions resolution|last=Reuters Editorial|work=U.S.|access-date=2019-09-25|language=en-US}}</ref> Rio Tinto's top executives rejected the resolution, arguing that the company had made a lot of progress in reducing its [[Greenhouse gas|greenhouse gas emissions]] and that appropriate plans were in place to deal with climate change.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/business/companies/rio-tinto-delivers-strong-defence-of-its-climate-change-stance-20180502-p4zcwc.html|title=Rio Tinto delivers strong defence of its climate change stance|last=Gray|first=Darren|date=2018-05-02|website=The Sydney Morning Herald|language=en|access-date=2019-09-25}}</ref>

Rio also argued that [[scope 3 emissions]], those of its customers, were beyond the firm's control.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.ft.com/content/3741e170-4997-11e9-8b7f-d49067e0f50d|title=Rio rebuffs climate investor push|date=March 18, 2019|work=Financial Times}}</ref> Nevertheless, the corporation in September 2019 signed a partnership with Chinese steelmaker [[Baowu|China Baowu Steel Group]] to find ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from [[steel]] making, in an attempt to tackle the scope 3 issue.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/sep/25/rio-tinto-strikes-deal-with-big-chinese-customer-to-find-ways-to-cut-emissions|title=Rio Tinto strikes deal with big Chinese customer to find ways to cut emissions|last=Butler|first=Ben|date=2019-09-25|work=The Guardian|access-date=2019-09-25|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>

Rio Tinto was also accused of planning and funding the murder of [[Right to Information Act, 2005|RTI]] activist [[Shehla Masood]] in [[Bhopal]], India. Apparently, she was protesting illegal diamond mining done by Rio Tinto in connivance with government officers. The case was, however, solved and no connection to Rio Tinto was established, though popular opinion still perceives them as the possible culprit.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://daily.bhaskar.com/news/MP-BHO-shehla-masood-case-solved-twitterati-slams-congress-2922727.html|title=Shehla Masood case solved: Twitterati slams Congress|date=29 February 2012|website=dailybhaskar}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Letters by Shehla Masood on Illegal mining|url=http://ibnlive.in.com/news/mystery-behind-shehla-masoods-murder-deepens/177484-3.html}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.outlookindia.com/magazine/story/i-fear-for-my-life-but-ill-go-on/278128|title="I Fear For My Life, But I'll Go On" &#124; Outlook India Magazine|website=Outlookindia.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=RTI activist shot dead|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-08-16/india/29891770_1_rti-activist-anna-hazare-gun-shot}}</ref>

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating a $3 billion impairment charge against Rio Tinto regarding a coal deal they made in Mozambique. Rio acquired [[Riversdale Mining]] Ltd., an Australian coal mining company with significant interests in Mozambique,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rivresources.com/IRM/content/default.aspx|title=Riversdale Resources Limited|website=www.rivresources.com|language=en|access-date=14 April 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://macauhub.com.mo/2009/05/18/7080/|title=Mozambique: Riversdale mining company to mine 20 million tonnes of coal per year in Tete province|date=18 May 2009|website=Macauhub|access-date=14 April 2017}}</ref> in 2011 for $2.9 billion in an all-cash deal. Two years later they wrote-down the value of the assets by $3 billion. Following the impairment charge, which included an additional $11 billion in asset write-downs, Chief Executive Officer of Rio Tinto, Tom Albanese stepped down from his post and left the company. Rio later sold the assets for $50 million.<ref name="Bloomberg.com"/>
