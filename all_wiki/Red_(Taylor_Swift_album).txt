'''''Red''''' is the fourth studio album by American singer-songwriter [[Taylor Swift]]. It was released on October 22, 2012, by [[Big Machine Records]]. Inspired by past romantic relationships evoking intense, tumultuous "[[Red#Symbolism|red]]" emotions that Swift was experiencing during the conception of the project, ''Red'' touches on the themes of romance and heartbreak, but represents a mature perspective, while exploring the pressure of being in the public eye. ''Red'' is a [[Pop music|pop]], [[country music|country]], and [[Rock music|rock]] album that experiments with [[arena rock]], [[alternative rock]], [[Dance music|dance]], [[dubstep]], [[Electronic music|electronic]], [[Folk music|folk]], and [[heartland rock]]; many critics called it Swift's dip into pop, while others regarded it her venture beyond traditional country styles.

The album contains two duets featuring guest acts: "[[The Last Time (Taylor Swift song)|The Last Time]]" featuring Irish singer [[Gary Lightbody]], and "[[Everything Has Changed]]" featuring English singer-songwriter [[Ed Sheeran]]. Preceded by two singles, ''Red'' was supported by seven singles in total, four of which became top ten hits on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]—the lead single "[[We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together]]" topped the chart for three weeks, marking Swift's first number-one single in the United States; the second single "[[Begin Again (Taylor Swift song)|Begin Again]]" arrived at number seven, while its follow-up "[[I Knew You Were Trouble]]" reached number two on the Hot 100; the fifth single "[[Red (Taylor Swift song)|Red]]" reached number six on the chart.

''Red'' received generally positive reviews from music critics, who praised Swift's [[songwriting]] craftsmanship, but were divided on the incorporation of various genres—her emerging versatility was praised but met criticism for being inconsistent. The album appeared in several publications' lists of the best albums of the 2010s, and ranked at number 99 on the 2020 revision of [[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time|''Rolling Stone''<nowiki/>'s 500 Greatest Albums of All Time]]. ''Red'' received nominations for [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]] and [[Grammy Award for Best Country Album|Best Country Album]] at the [[56th Annual Grammy Awards]], and for Album of the Year at the [[2013 Country Music Association Awards]].

''Red'' debuted at number-one on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] with first-week sales of 1.2&nbsp;million copies, giving Swift her third consecutive chart-topper in the US, making her the first female artist to have two million-selling album openings; it went on to spend seven weeks atop the chart. It was also Swift's first chart-topper in the UK, and topped charts in Australia, Canada, Ireland, and New Zealand. The [[International Federation of the Phonographic Industry]] (IFPI) reported ''Red'' as the second best-selling album of 2012, with sales of 5.2 million copies globally. To support the album, Swift embarked on [[The Red Tour]], which ran from March 2013 to June 2014 and grossed over $150 million. As of July, 23, 2018, ''Red'' had been certified [[RIAA certification|7× Platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]], for moving over seven million units in the US.<ref name="RIAA">{{cite certification|region=United States|artist=Taylor Swift|accessdate=September 21, 2020}}</ref>

==Background==
[[Taylor Swift]] released her third studio album ''[[Speak Now]]'', for which she was the sole writer, in October 2010. Co-produced by Swift and her longtime collaborator [[Nathan Chapman (record producer)|Nathan Chapman]], the album musically expands on Swift's characteristic [[country music|country]] roots and blends elements of radio-friendly [[pop music|pop]] crossover, which had been evident on its predecessor ''[[Fearless (Taylor Swift album)|Fearless]]'' (2008).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/speak-now-mw0002025410|title=Speak Now – Taylor Swift|publisher=[[AllMusic]]|authorlink=Stephen Thomas Erlewine |first=Stephen |last=Thomas Erlewine|accessdate=March 2, 2019}}</ref> It also incorporates various [[rock music|rock]] styles, including [[pop rock]] and [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]].<ref name="NMEgreatest">{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/features/taylor-swift-best-albums-ranked-in-order-2712330|title=Taylor Swift: every single album ranked and rated|first=Hannah|last=Mylrae|work=[[NME]]|date=July 24, 2020|accessdate=September 27, 2020}}</ref> ''Speak Now'' was the fastest-selling digital album by a female artist, with 278,000 downloads in a week, earning Swift an entry in the 2010 ''[[Guinness World Records]]''.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Fastest-selling digital album in the US by a female artist|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/fastest-selling-digital-album-in-the-us-by-a-female-artist/|accessdate=June 16, 2015|work=[[Guinness World Records]]|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150622164555/http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/fastest-selling-digital-album-in-the-us-by-a-female-artist/|archivedate=June 22, 2015}}</ref> At the [[54th Annual Grammy Awards|2012 Grammy Awards]], the album was nominated for [[Grammy Award for Best Country Album|Best Country Album]], and its single "[[Mean (song)|Mean]]" won [[Grammy Award for Best Country Song|Best Country Song]] and [[Grammy Award for Best Country Solo Performance|Best Country Solo Performance]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/grammy-awards-2012-winners-whitney-houston-death-adele-289778 |title=Grammy Awards 2012: Complete Winners And Nominees List |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |accessdate=January 25, 2015 |date=February 12, 2012 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150122045320/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/grammy-awards-2012-winners-whitney-houston-death-adele-289778 |archivedate=January 22, 2015}}</ref>

Swift decided that the album would not follow one coherent [[genre]], aiming to experiment with as many styles as she could.<ref name="yahoo"/> To this end, she recruited musicians whose works she admired, hoping to "learn from them."<ref name="USA_Today"/> Although Swift was determined to incorporate various musical styles, she prioritized the lyrics over the production, striving to convey her emotions most effectively as she had done on her previous songs. She would start writing by identifying an emotion to a song, and the production would follow.<ref name="BB_cover">{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130614085411/https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/474541/taylor-swifts-red-the-billboard-cover-story|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/474541/taylor-swifts-red-the-billboard-cover-story|title=Taylor Swift's 'Red': The Billboard Cover Story|first=Phil|last=Gallo|date=October 22, 2012|archivedate=June 14, 2013|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]}}</ref> This had been a staple of Swift's songwriting process, where she would put in her most personal thoughts as a source of relief.<ref name="Nash">{{cite news|url=http://www.nashcountrydaily.com/2012/10/29/taylor-swift-talks-writing-relationships-rejects-and-new-album-red/|title=Taylor Swift Talks Writing, Relationships, Rejects and New Album 'Red'|first=Deborah Evans|last=Price|date=October 29, 2012|newspaper=[[Nash Country Weekly]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190302061136/http://www.nashcountrydaily.com/2012/10/29/taylor-swift-talks-writing-relationships-rejects-and-new-album-red/|archivedate=March 2, 2019}}</ref> On songs that Swift co-wrote with other writers, she first presented to them the feelings that she had been going through, played a rough [[demo (music)|demo]] on her guitar, and then asked for their idea on how to better convey the story.<ref name="BB_qa"/> Each song would have a different production corresponding to the emotion portrayed, resulting in an eclectic mix of styles.<ref name="yahoo"/>

A critical point when Swift was in the midst of the songwriting process with Chapman was the song "[[Red (Taylor Swift song)|Red]]", for which her creativity "started wandering to all the places we could go."<ref name="BB_qa"/> Big Machine's president [[Scott Borchetta]] overheard the original production by Chapman and suggested a more pop-oriented sound.<ref name="Time">{{cite web|url=https://time.com/3583129/power-of-taylor-swift-cover/|title=The Power of Taylor Swift|first=Jack|last=Dickey|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=November 13, 2014|accessdate=August 8, 2020}}</ref> After several failed attempts at the desired sound, Swift asked Borchetta to recruit Swedish producer [[Max Martin]], whose chart-topping pop tunes had intrigued Swift by "how [they] can just land a chorus."<ref name="BB_qa"/><ref name="Time"/> Martin and his frequent collaborator [[Shellback (record producer)|Shellback]] produced three songs on the album: "[[22 (Taylor Swift song)|22]]", "[[I Knew You Were Trouble]]", and "[[We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together]]", all of which are characterized by the pair's trademark [[synthesizer]]s and [[electronic music|electronic]] production.<ref name="Time"/> The final version of "Red" was produced by Swift, Chapman, and [[Dann Huff]].<ref name="Credits"/> Huff, who had produced for several country artists, also worked with Swift and Chapman on two other songs: "Starlight" and "[[Begin Again (Taylor Swift song)|Begin Again]]".<ref name="USA_Today"/><ref name="Credits"/>

Another new collaborator was [[Jeff Bhasker]], whose production of the song "[[We Are Young]]" (2011) by indie band [[Fun (band)|Fun]] captivated Swift by its [[drum machine|drum]] instrumentation.<ref name="yahoo"/><ref name="Nash"/> Bhasker produced two songs: "Holy Ground" and "The Lucky One".<ref name="Credits"/> Swift worked with [[Butch Walker]] on the song "[[Everything Has Changed]]", a duet with English singer [[Ed Sheeran]].<ref name="USA_Today"/> She admired Walker for "how he creates this really organic but emotionally charged music."<ref name="yahoo"/> The song "Treacherous" was produced by [[Dan Wilson (musician)|Dan Wilson]], whose works with his band [[Semisonic]] served as an inspiration for Swift.<ref name="USA_Today"/><ref name="Nash"/> Swift also enlisted musicians [[Gary Lightbody]] and [[Jacknife Lee]] of the [[indie rock|indie]] band [[Snow Patrol]], citing that "they can just hit you when they are singing about loss or longing."<ref name="BB_qa"/> Lee produced the song "[[The Last Time (Taylor Swift song)|The Last Time]]", on which Lightbody credits as a featured vocalist.<ref name="USA_Today"/> Swift wrote more than 30 songs for the album, of which 16 made the final cut of the standard edition.<ref name="newalbum">{{cite web |last=Effron|first=Lauren|url=http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/entertainment/2012/08/taylor-swift-reveals-new-album-red-drops-new-single-we-are-never-getting-back-together-abc-exclusive/|title=Taylor Swift Reveals New Album, 'Red,' Drops New Single, 'We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together': ABC Exclusive|date=August 13, 2012|accessdate=February 18, 2013|publisher=[[American Broadcasting Company]]}}</ref> Of the 16 tracks, Swift was the sole writer of 10 and co-writer of the remaining six.<ref name="Nash"/>

{{Quote|quote = All the different emotions that are written about on this album are all pretty much about the kind of tumultuous, crazy, insane, intense, semi-toxic relationships that I've experienced in the last two years. All those emotions — spanning from intense love, intense frustration, jealousy, confusion, all of that — in my mind, all those emotions are red. You know, there's nothing in between. There's nothing beige about any of those feelings.

The album's [[lead single]], "[[We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together]]", was released on August 13, 2012, and became Swift's first No.&nbsp;1 single on the [[US Billboard Hot 100|US ''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. The song's jump from its debut position No.&nbsp;72 to No.&nbsp;1 was the result of a massive digital demand of the song. With 623,000 downloads, the song placed second among all-time best week sales singles, behind [[Flo Rida]]'s 2009 song "[[Right Round]]". It stayed at No.&nbsp;1 for three non-consecutive weeks, being displaced twice at the top, first by "Flo Rida's "[[Whistle (Flo Rida song)|Whistle]]" and second by [[Maroon 5]]'s "[[One More Night (Maroon 5 song)|One More Night]]". The song stayed in the top ten for thirteen weeks and charted for a total of twenty-four weeks. In [[UK Singles Charts|UK]], it peaked at No.&nbsp;4, giving her her first top ten hit since "[[Love Story (Taylor Swift song)|Love Story]]" (2008) and the song became her first No.&nbsp;1 song in [[Recording Industry Association of New Zealand|New Zealand]]. As of December 2012, "We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together" has sold more than three million downloads in the US.

"[[Begin Again (Taylor Swift song)|Begin Again]]" was released to the [[iTunes Store]] on September 25, 2012 as part of a countdown to the album release.

The song sold 299,000 digital copies in its first week of release and debuted at No.&nbsp;7 on the [[US Billboard Hot 100|US ''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart dated October 4, 2012.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/474810/psy-cant-beat-maroon-5-in-close-race-for-hot-100s-top-spot |title=PSY Can't Beat Maroon 5 In Close Race For Hot 100's Top Spot |work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |date=October 3, 2012 |accessdate=October 3, 2012 |archive-date=February 24, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170224023928/http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/474810/psy-cant-beat-maroon-5-in-close-race-for-hot-100s-top-spot |url-status=live }}</ref> It was later announced that the track would be serviced to country radio on October 1, 2012 as the second single from the album.<ref>{{cite web|title=Taylor Swift's New Single "Begin Again" Impacts Country Radio October 1, Available Now On iTunes|url=http://www.countrymusicrocks.net/2012/09/taylor-swifts-new-single-begin-again-impacts-country-radio-october-1-availble-now-on-itunes.html|work=Country Music Rockst|accessdate=September 25, 2012|date=September 25, 2012|archive-date=January 29, 2013|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6E1tOQM2l?url=http://www.countrymusicrocks.net/2012/09/taylor-swifts-new-single-begin-again-impacts-country-radio-october-1-available-now-on-itunes.html|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/474916/maroon-5-still-tops-hot-100-psy-one-step-from-no-1 |title=Maroon 5 Still Tops Hot 100, PSY One Step From No. 1 |work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |date=September 26, 2012 |accessdate=September 26, 2012 |archive-date=April 17, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130417095048/http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/474916/maroon-5-still-tops-hot-100-psy-one-step-from-no-1 |url-status=live }}</ref> The song became her seventeenth consecutive top ten hit in [[Hot Country Songs|US ''Billboard'' Hot Country Songs]], but also tied with "[[Fearless (Taylor Swift song)|Fearless]]" as her lowest-charting single on the chart, although it reached No.&nbsp;3 on ''Billboard'' [[Country Airplay]].

''Red'' was met with generally positive reviews.

Reviewing for ''Rolling Stone'' in October 2012, Jon Dolan believed Swift had been influenced by [[Joni Mitchell]] and [[U2]], writing that "her self-discovery project is one of the best stories in pop.

Some reviewers were more reserved in their praise. Jonathan Keefe from ''[[Slant Magazine]]'' wrote in 2012 that, as a pop record, ''Red'' is not consistent enough to be considered "truly great" because a number of songs lacked Swift's "usual spark". Nonetheless, he concluded that "its highlights are career-best work for Swift, who now sounds like the pop star she was destined to be all along."<ref name="Slant">{{cite web |last=Keefe |first=Jonathan |url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/music/review/taylor-swift-red/2900 |title=Taylor Swift: Red |publisher=[[Slant Magazine]] |date=October 22, 2012 |accessdate=December 27, 2012 |archive-date=October 12, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012014408/http://www.slantmagazine.com/music/review/taylor-swift-red/2900 |url-status=live }}</ref> Michael Gallucci from ''[[The A.V.

He dismissed the duets as boring, while calling "State of Grace" and "All Too Well" "fascinating work".<ref name="A.V.

He preferred its feistier tracks but also appreciated the more sentimental songs "Begin Again" and "Stay Stay Stay", which "stay happy and hit just as hard".<ref name="MSN Music"/>

At the end of the 2010s, Metacritic listed ''Red'' as one of the 15 most frequent ranked albums on decade-end best-of lists by publications.<ref name = "Metacritic">{{cite web|title= Best Albums of the Decade (2010-19)|url= https://www.metacritic.com/feature/best-albums-of-the-decade-2010s|work= [[Metacritic]]|publisher= [[Metacritic]] - CBS Interactive Inc.|date= January 11, 2020|accessdate= February 9, 2020|archive-date= November 15, 2019|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20191115223758/https://www.metacritic.com/feature/best-albums-of-the-decade-2010s|url-status= live}}</ref> In September 2020, ''Rolling Stone'' listed ''Red'' as one of the 500 greatest albums of all time, ranking it at number 99, and stated that her unexpected transition from her country roots to pop and rock territories resulted in an album that "recalled classics by [[the Beatles]] and [[Prince]]". The publication also praised the album's lyricism as Swift's best songwriting, portraying "post-breakup" as vividly as any artist ever, and picked the tracks "[[We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together]]", "[[I Knew You Were Trouble]]", "[[Red (Taylor Swift song)|Red]]" and "[[All Too Well]]" as highlights.<ref name=":RSAlltime">{{Cite web|last=Stone|first=Rolling|date=September 22, 2020|title=The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/best-albums-of-all-time-1062063/|access-date=September 22, 2020|website=Rolling Stone}}</ref>
