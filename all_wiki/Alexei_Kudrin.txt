== Finance minister ==
[[File:Kozak, Kudrin and Kasyanov in 2003.jpg|thumb|right|Dmitry Kozak, Alexei Kudrin and Mikhail Kasyanov in 2003]]
Kudrin served as finance minister from May 2000 to September 2011.<ref>{{cite news|title=Kudrin resigns as finance minister |url=http://themoscownews.com/news/20110926/189070293.html |accessdate=25 August 2013 |newspaper=The Moscow Times |date=26 September 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140228111408/http://themoscownews.com/news/20110926/189070293.html |archivedate=28 February 2014 }}</ref> Kudrin belongs to the group of so-called "St Petersburg economists"—liberal reformers who worked with Putin during his time in the St Petersburg administration—one of the three main [[Political groups under Vladimir Putin's presidency|informal groups]] during Putin's presidency.<ref name="willerton">{{cite book|last=Willerton|first=John|title=Developments in Russian Politics|editor=White |editor2=Gitelman |editor3=Sakwa|publisher=Duke University Press|year=2005|volume=6|chapter=Putin and the Hegemonic Presidency|isbn=0-8223-3522-0}}</ref> John P.

=== Prudent fiscal management ===
[[File:Dmitry Medvedev 27 May 2008-2.jpg|thumb|right|Kudrin meeting with President Dmitry Medvedev on 27 May 2008]]
During Putin's presidency, Russia's macroeconomic policies were highly prudent, and extra income from oil exports was put in stabilization funds.<ref name="hanson"/> The [[Stabilization Fund of the Russian Federation]] is widely regarded as Kudrin's idea. Alexander Osin, chief economist at Finam Management, regards the Stabilization Fund as one of Kudrin's main achievements.<ref name="rp_kononova"/> However, other analysts have described The Stabilization Fund as "dead money", which doesn't benefit the real economy.<ref name="rp_kononova"/> The Stabilization Fund was split into the [[Reserve Fund of the Russian Federation|Reserve Fund]] and [[National Welfare Fund of the Russian Federation|National Welfare Fund]] in February 2008.<ref name="rian_fundsplit">{{cite news|url=http://en.rian.ru/business/20070411/63487391.html|title=Russia's Duma approves Stabilization Fund transformation|work=RIA Novosti|date=11 April 2007}}</ref>

In 2005, Kudrin and Prime Minister [[Mikhail Fradkov]] clashed over a proposal to cut VAT tax from 18% to 13%. Fradkov supported the proposal, but Kudrin argued that lower VAT could endanger stability of the ruble and would cause the government to withdraw money from the stabilization fund.<ref name="mt_prevails">{{cite news|url=http://www.themoscowtimes.com/business/article/kudrin-prevails-over-fradkov-in-vat-spat/224640.html|title=Kudrin Prevails Over Fradkov in VAT Spat 
|work=The Moscow Times|date=14 March 2005}}</ref> The same year, Kudrin received the "Finance Minister of the Year 2005" award by the [[Banker magazine]].<ref name="rt_euromoney"/>

On 21 August 2006, Russia paid its debts, totalling $23.7 billion to the [[Paris Club]]. Simon Pirani, writing for ''Emerging Markets'', praised Kudrin's refusal to be "blown off course by other ministers' whims" in his quest to repay the debt. He also credited Kudrin with sound conduct of the ruble exchange rate and capable fiscal management that has arguably helped to prevent the most serious problems of the so-called [[Dutch disease]].<ref name="pirani">{{cite news|url=http://www.emergingmarkets.org/Article/1079709/Search/Results/Finance-Minister-of-the-year-Europe.html?Keywords=kudrin|title=Finance Minister of the year, Europe|publisher=EmergingMarket|last1=Pirani|first1=Simon|date=19 September 2006}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> In 2006, Kudrin received the award "Best Finance Minister of a Developing European Country" by the Emerging Markets newspaper, published by the IMF and the World Bank.<ref name="rp_kononova">{{cite web|url=http://www.russiaprofile.org/page.php?pageid=Business&articleid=a1287423765|title=Cracking the Piggy Bank|last1=Kononova|first1=Svetlana|publisher=Russia Profile|date=18 October 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101103231728/http://www.russiaprofile.org/page.php?pageid=Business&articleid=a1287423765|archivedate=3 November 2010}}</ref>

As the father and supporter of the prudent fiscal management policies, Kudrin had to endure strong criticism from other members of the government, who believed the money should instead be invested in the country's development. In the end, Kudrin's stance prevailed. The savings later proved crucial in helping Russia to come out of the [[Late-2000s recession|financial crisis]] in a much better state than many experts had expected,<ref name="euromoney"/><ref name="rt_euromoney">{{cite news|url=http://rt.com/Top_News/2010-10-11/kudrin-euromoney-award-2010.html|title=Kudrin: Finance Minister of the year|work=Russia Today|date=11 October 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101015212734/http://rt.com/Top_News/2010-10-11/kudrin-euromoney-award-2010.html|archivedate=15 October 2010}}</ref> and Kudrin was widely credited for his policies.<ref name="hanson">{{cite book|last1=Hanson|first1=Philip |editor1-first=Stephen|editor1-last=White |title=Developments in Russian Politics 7|year=2010|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=New York|isbn=978-0-230-22449-0 |chapter=Managing the Economy}}</ref>

=== Other policy stances ===
Although he has often spoken in favour of privatisation and lessening the state role in economy, Kudrin also supported the creation of the so-called [[national champions]].<ref name="pirani"/> Kudrin has said that the state's role in the oil industry should not be increased, and has indicated that the purchase of [[Sibneft]] by [[Gazprom]] and the merger of some former [[Yukos]] assets to state-controlled oil company [[Rosneft]] were taken at a particular stage of the restructuring of the sector. According to Kudrin, "no-one regards state ownership of such assets as an end in itself" and "we are not going to see a continuous strengthening of the state’s position."<ref name="pirani2">{{cite news|url=http://www.emergingmarkets.org/Article/1048040/Search/Results/Kudrin-battles-hard-for-reform.html?Keywords=kudrin|title=Kudrin battles hard for reform|last1=Pirani|first1=Simon|publisher=Emerging Markets|date=20 July 2006}}</ref>

As Finance Minister, Kudrin has also supported increasing the retirement age and cutting down on bureaucracy. For his policies, he has often been the target of criticism, especially from the [[United Russia]] party, which he has refused to join.<ref name="rp_kononova"/> According to Renaissance Capital, Kudrin's poll ratings are not favourable as he is seen as responsible for some highly criticized welfare reforms, although economic experts say that the reforms proved to be highly effective.<ref name="rc">{{cite web|url=http://research.rencap.com/eng/government/government_detail28.asp|title=Alexei Kudrin|publisher=Renaissance Capital|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061101190532/http://research.rencap.com/eng/government/government_detail28.asp|archivedate=1 November 2006}}</ref>

=== After the economic crisis ===
In the aftermath of the [[Late-2000s recession|late 2000s global economic crisis]], Russia's state budget went into deficit for the first time in years. Kudrin has said that the projected budget deficit is to total 3.6% in 2011, 3.1% in 2012 and 2.9% in 2013. The deficit will be covered primarily through expanded market borrowing.<ref name="budget2011speech"/> Russia conducted its first international debt sale since 1998 in April 2010, raising $5.5bn on the international markets.<ref name="bbc_rozhnov"/> According to Kudrin, the government's aim is to attain a deficit-free budget by 2015, based on projected $75–78 oil prices per barrel.<ref name="budget2011speech">{{cite web|url=http://government.ru/eng/docs/12649/|title=Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance Alexei Kudrin addresses State Duma in connection with submitting the federal budget for 2011 and the 2012-2013 planning period|publisher=Government|date=20 October 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724164448/http://government.ru/eng/docs/12649/|archivedate=24 July 2011}}</ref> Kudrin has said that the Reserve Fund, accumulated before the crisis, will run out in 2011. Consequently, Kudrin warned that Russia will soon have to adjust to being a country, just "like everyone else" and called for a more effective use of state funds.<ref name="bbc_rozhnov">{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10132247|title=Russia looks beyond its oil reserves|last1=Rozhnov|first1=Konstantin|work=BBC News|date=10 May 2010}}</ref>

=== Finance Minister of the Year 2010 ===
In October 2010, Kudrin was declared "Finance Minister of the Year 2010" by the ''[[Euromoney]]'' magazine. The magazine said that "Kudrin is rightly hailed as a fiscal manager of the highest order" and praised his "championing of the free market and fiscal prudence". According to ''Euromoney'', the Stabilization Fund created and supported by Kudrin also "enabled Russia to pay off its foreign debt early", and noted that "Kudrin is rightly praised for his commitment to tax and budget reform, Russia’s desire to join the World Trade Organization (WTO) and continuing the progress in privatization." <ref name="rp_kononova"/>

In the award ceremony, Kudrin said: "Russia has already learnt this lesson; it was able to prepare and pass through this period. In this context, this is a result. And when you see your result, you feel satisfied. And when the result is praised by the professional community, it is especially important."<ref name="rp_kononova"/>

== Back to Academia ==
Since his resignation in September 2011, Kudrin is the dean of Faculty of Liberal Arts and Sciences at St. Petersburg University. As of 2016, he is co-chairman of the board of trustees of the [[Mariinsky Theatre]],<ref>{{cite web| url=http://gergiev-charity.com/eng/partners/| title =Our Partners, Valery Gergiev Charitable Foundation| access-date = 11 September 2016}}</ref> and the chairman of the foundation of the Board of Trustees of the [[European University at St. Petersburg]].<ref>{{cite web| url=https://eu.spb.ru/en/eusp-fund| title = EUSP Fund About Us| work=European University at St. Petersburg| access-date = 11 September 2016}}</ref>

===Political activities===
Kurdrin is the head of the [[Civil Initiatives Committee]], a [[Non Governmental Organization]] which promotes Human Right and development of [[Civil society]] in Russia. At the opening of the All-Russian Civil Forum, organized by his Committee, Kudrin said the Law on non-governmental organizations - "foreign agents" should be abolished or completely reworded.<ref>{{cite web| url =http://en.itar-tass.com/russia/708695| title =Law on NGO - foreign agents should not exist - Alexei Kudrin| work =[[ITAR Tass]]| accessdate = 23 November 2013}}</ref>

===2014 sanctions===
Kudrin said in November 2014 that "Formal and informal sanctions have already seriously impacted the Russian economy. Bringing back the previous opportunities when it comes to foreign investment and trust in the rouble can be achieved only within seven to 10 years of growth of our economy."<ref>"[http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/former-russian-finance-minister-alexei-kudrin-warns-putin-over-populist-policies-1475920 Former Russian Finance Minister Alexei Kudrin Warns Putin Over 'Populist' Policies]". ''International Business Times''. 21 November 2014.</ref>

==Previous speculation on future roles==
During his [[Mikhail Prokhorov 2012 presidential campaign|2012 presidential campaign]], businessman [[Mikhail Prokhorov]] said he would appoint Kudrin as [[Prime Minister of Russia|Prime Minister]], but, Prokhorov lost the election.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rferl.org/a/prokhorov_lays_out_presidential_election_platform/24458038.html |title=Prokhorov Says He's No 'Kremlin Stooge,' Lays Out Campaign Platform |date=20 January 2012 |website=www.rferl |publisher=RadioFreeEurope/RadioLiberty |access-date=27 July 2019 |quote=}}</ref>

===2018 presidential campaign speculation===
On 18 June 2015, Kudrin proposed to hold snap presidential elections. He justified this need for global reform and cited the example of the [[President of Kazakhstan]] [[Nursultan Nazarbayev]], who did just that. [[State Duma]] deputy from the party [[A Just Russia]] Mikhail Emelyanov considered this statement Kudrin's entry into the presidential race. The next day, Kudrin said that he is not going to run for the presidency. However, many experts continued to believe that Kudrin wants to return to the [[Government of Russia|Federal Government]], and even take the place of the Prime Minister.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://kommersant.ru/doc/2750769|title=Алексей Кудрин не идет в президенты|newspaper=Kommersant|date=19 June 2015|language=ru|access-date=9 April 2020}}</ref>

After the [[2018 Russian presidential election]] during the formation of the [[Dmitry Medvedev's Second Cabinet|new government]], Prime Minister [[Dmitry Medvedev]] nominated Chairwoman of the [[Accounts Chamber of Russia|Accounts Chamber]] [[Tatyana Golikova]] as Deputy Prime Minister.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://ria.ru/politics/20180507/1520072692.html|title=Медведев предложил кандидатов в новый состав правительства|work=РИА Новости|access-date=7 May 2018|language=ru}}</ref> On 10 May, the [[United Russia]] party proposed to nominate Kudrin to post of Chairman of the Accounts Chamber, instead of Golikova.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://vz.ru/news/2018/5/10/922081.html|title=Кудрину предложили важный пост|work=Взгляд|access-date=14 May 2018|language=ru}}</ref> This was the most anticipated nomination, as pundits observed that Kudrin's role in the new government would set the degree of reformative policies under Putin's fourth term. The low-importance of the position led some observers to speculate that this development signals that the new government has no sizable plans for economic reforms.
