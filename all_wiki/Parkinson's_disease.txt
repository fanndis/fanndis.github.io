Parkinson's disease is the most common form of parkinsonism and is sometimes called "idiopathic parkinsonism", meaning parkinsonism with no identifiable cause.<ref name="pmid15172778"/><ref name="Jankovic_book-Epidemiology">{{cite book | last = Schrag | first = Anette |chapter=Epidemiology of movement disorders | veditors = Tolosa E, Jankovic JJ | title=Parkinson's disease and movement disorders |publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins |location=Hagerstown, Maryland |year=2007 |pages= 50–66 |isbn=978-0-7817-7881-7}}</ref> Identifiable causes of parkinsonism include toxins, infections, side effects of drugs, metabolic derangement, and brain lesions such as strokes. Several neurodegenerative disorders also may present with parkinsonism and are sometimes referred to as "atypical parkinsonism" or [[Parkinson plus syndrome|"Parkinson plus"]] syndromes (illnesses with parkinsonism plus some other features distinguishing them from PD).

Scientists sometimes refer to Parkinson’s disease as a [[synucleinopathy]] (due to an abnormal accumulation of [[alpha-synuclein]] protein in the brain) to distinguish it from other neurodegenerative diseases, such as [[Alzheimer's disease]] where the brain accumulates [[tau protein]].<ref name="pmid16489609">{{cite journal | vauthors = Galpern WR, Lang AE | title = Interface between tauopathies and synucleinopathies: a tale of two proteins | journal = Annals of Neurology | volume = 59 | issue = 3 | pages = 449–58 | date = March 2006 | pmid = 16489609 | doi = 10.1002/ana.20819 | s2cid = 19395939 | orig-year = 17 February 2006 }}</ref> Considerable clinical and pathological overlap exists between [[tauopathy|tauopathies]] and synucleinopathies.

Dementia with Lewy bodies is another synucleinopathy and it has close pathological similarities with PD, especially with the subset of PD cases with [[dementia]] known as [[Parkinson's disease dementia]].

{{Main|Signs and symptoms of Parkinson's disease}}
The most recognizable symptoms in Parkinson's disease are movement ("motor") related.<ref name=Jankovic2008/> Non-motor symptoms, which include [[autonomic nervous system|autonomic]] dysfunction, [[neuropsychiatry|neuropsychiatric]] problems (mood, cognition, behavior or thought alterations), and sensory (especially altered sense of smell) and sleep difficulties, are also common. Some of these non-motor symptoms may be present at the time of diagnosis.<ref name=Jankovic2008/>

===Motor===
{{Further|Parkinsonism}}
Four motor symptoms are considered [[Cardinal sign (pathology)|cardinal]] in PD: tremor, slowness of movement (bradykinesia), rigidity, and postural instability.<ref name=Jankovic2008>{{cite journal | vauthors = Jankovic J | title = Parkinson's disease: clinical features and diagnosis | journal = Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry | volume = 79 | issue = 4 | pages = 368–76 | date = April 2008 | pmid = 18344392 | doi = 10.1136/jnnp.2007.131045 | url = http://jnnp.bmj.com/content/79/4/368.full | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150819084941/http://jnnp.bmj.com/content/79/4/368.full | df = dmy-all | url-status=live | archive-date = 19 August 2015 | doi-access = free }}</ref>

The most common presenting sign is a coarse slow [[tremor]] of the hand at rest which disappears during voluntary movement of the affected arm and in the deeper stages of sleep.<ref name=Jankovic2008/> It typically appears in only one hand, eventually affecting both hands as the disease progresses.<ref name=Jankovic2008/> Frequency of PD tremor is between 4 and 6 [[hertz]] (cycles per second). A feature of tremor is ''pill-rolling'', the tendency of the index finger and thumb to touch and perform together a circular movement.<ref name=Jankovic2008/><ref name="Cooper"/> The term derives from the similarity between the movement of people with PD and the early pharmaceutical technique of manually making pills.<ref name="Cooper">{{cite book | vauthors = Cooper G, Eichhorn G, Rodnitzky RL |chapter=Parkinson's disease | veditors = Conn PM | title=Neuroscience in medicine|publisher=Humana Press|location=Totowa, NJ|year=2008 |pages= 508–12|isbn=978-1-60327-454-8}}</ref>

[[Bradykinesia]] (slowness of movement) is found in every case of PD, and is due to disturbances in [[motor planning]] of movement initiation, and associated with difficulties along the whole course of the movement process, from planning to initiation to execution of a movement. Performance of sequential and simultaneous movement is impaired. Bradykinesia is the most handicapping symptom of Parkinson’s disease leading to difficulties with everyday tasks such as dressing, feeding, and bathing. It leads to particular difficulty in carrying out two independent motor activities at the same time and can be made worse by emotional stress or concurrent illnesses.

===Neuropsychiatric===
Parkinson's disease can cause [[Neuropsychiatry|neuropsychiatric]] disturbances, which can range from mild to severe. This includes disorders of cognition, mood, behavior, and thought.<ref name=Jankovic2008/>

A person with PD has two to six times the risk of dementia compared to the general population.<ref name=Jankovic2008/><ref name="pmid18175397"/> Up to 78% of people with PD have Parkinson's disease dementia.<ref name=Gomperts2016>{{cite journal |vauthors=Gomperts SN |title=Lewy Body Dementias: Dementia With Lewy Bodies and Parkinson Disease Dementia |journal=Continuum (Minneap Minn) |volume=22 |issue=2 Dementia |pages=435–63 |date=April 2016 |pmid=27042903 |pmc=5390937 |doi=10.1212/CON.0000000000000309|type=Review}}</ref> The prevalence of dementia increases with age and, to a lesser degree, duration of the disease.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Garcia-Ptacek S, Kramberger MG | title = Parkinson Disease and Dementia | journal = Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry and Neurology | volume = 29 | issue = 5 | pages = 261–70 | date = September 2016 | pmid = 27502301 | doi = 10.1177/0891988716654985 | s2cid = 21279235 }}</ref> Dementia is associated with a reduced [[quality of life]] in people with PD and their [[caregiver]]s, increased mortality, and a higher probability of needing [[nursing home care]].<ref name="pmid18175397"/>

Impulse control disorders including pathological gambling, compulsive sexual behavior, binge eating, compulsive shopping and reckless generosity can be caused by medication, particularly orally active dopamine agonists. The [[dopamine dysregulation syndrome]] – with wanting of medication leading to overusage – is a rare complication of levodopa use.<ref name="Noyce"/>

Behavior and mood alterations are more common in PD without cognitive impairment than in the general population, and are usually present in PD with dementia. The most frequent mood difficulties are [[Depression (mood)|depression]], [[apathy]], and [[anxiety]].<ref name=Jankovic2008/> Establishing the diagnosis of depression is complicated by the fact that the body language of depression may masquerade as PD including a sad expressionless anxious face, a hang dog appearance, slow movement, and monotonous speech. Up to 30% of people with PD may experience symptoms of anxiety, ranging from a [[generalized anxiety disorder]] to [[social phobia]], [[panic disorder]]s and [[obsessive compulsive disorder]]s. They contribute to impaired quality of life and increased severity of motor symptoms such as on/off fluctuations or freezing episodes.

[[Punding]] in which complicated repetitive aimless [[Stereotypy|stereotyped behaviors]] occur for many hours is another disturbance caused by anti-Parkinson medication.

[[Hallucination]]s or [[delusion]]s occur in approximately 50% of people with PD over the course of the illness, and may herald the emergence of dementia. These range from minor hallucinations – "sense of passage" (something quickly passing beside the person) or "sense of presence" (the perception of something/someone standing just to the side or behind the person) – to full blown vivid, [[Positive visual phenomena#Hallucinations|formed visual hallucinations]] and [[paranoid]] ideation. Auditory hallucinations are uncommon in PD, and are rarely described as voices. It is now believed that psychosis is an integral part of the disease. A psychosis with delusions and associated [[delirium]] is a recognized complication of anti-Parkinson drug treatment and may also be caused by urinary tract infections (as frequently occurs in the fragile elderly), but drugs and infection are not the only factors, and underlying brain pathology or changes in neurotransmitters or their receptors (e.g., acetylcholine, serotonin) are also thought to play a role in psychosis in PD.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Shergill SS, Walker Z, Le Katona C | title = A preliminary investigation of laterality in Parkinson's disease and susceptibility to psychosis | journal = Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry | volume = 65 | issue = 4 | pages = 610–11 | date = October 1998 | pmid = 9771806 | pmc = 2170290 | doi = 10.1136/jnnp.65.4.610 }}</ref><ref name="pmid20538500">{{cite journal | vauthors = Friedman JH | title = Parkinson's disease psychosis 2010: a review article | journal = Parkinsonism & Related Disorders | volume = 16 | issue = 9 | pages = 553–60 | date = November 2010 | pmid = 20538500 | doi = 10.1016/j.parkreldis.2010.05.004 }}</ref>

[[Sleep disorder]]s are a feature of the disease and can be worsened by medications.<ref name=Jankovic2008/> Symptoms can manifest as daytime [[somnolence|drowsiness]] (including sudden sleep attacks resembling [[narcolepsy]]), disturbances in [[Rapid eye movement sleep|REM]] sleep, or [[insomnia]].<ref name=Jankovic2008/> [[Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder|REM behavior disorder]] (RBD), in which patients act out dreams, sometimes injuring themselves or their bed partner, may begin many years before the development of motor or cognitive features of PD or [[dementia with Lewy bodies|DLB]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kim YE, Jeon BS | title = Clinical implication of REM sleep behavior disorder in Parkinson's disease | journal = Journal of Parkinson's Disease | volume = 4 | issue = 2 | pages = 237–44 | date = 1 January 2014 | pmid = 24613864 | doi = 10.3233/jpd-130293 }}</ref>

Alterations in the [[autonomic nervous system]] can lead to [[orthostatic hypotension]] (low blood pressure upon standing), [[Seborrhea|oily skin]] and excessive sweating, [[urinary incontinence]], and altered sexual function.<ref name=Jankovic2008/> [[Constipation]] and [[Intestinal pseudoobstruction|impaired stomach emptying (gastric dysmotility)]] can be severe enough to cause discomfort and even endanger health.<ref name="pmid19691125"/> Changes in perception may include an impaired sense of smell, disturbed vision, pain, and [[paresthesia]] (tingling and numbness).<ref name=Jankovic2008/> All of these symptoms can occur years before diagnosis of the disease.<ref name=Jankovic2008/>

A particular conceptual model of the motor circuit and its alteration with PD has been of great influence since 1980, although some limitations have been pointed out which have led to modifications.<ref name="pmid18781672"/> In this model, the basal ganglia normally exert a constant inhibitory influence on a wide range of motor systems, preventing them from becoming active at inappropriate times. When a decision is made to perform a particular action, [[Inhibitory postsynaptic potential|inhibition]] is reduced for the required motor system, thereby releasing it for activation. Dopamine acts to facilitate this release of inhibition, so high levels of dopamine function tend to promote motor activity, while low levels of dopamine function, such as occur in PD, demand greater exertions of effort for any given movement. Thus, the net effect of dopamine depletion is to produce [[hypokinesia]], an overall reduction in motor output.<ref name="pmid18781672"/> Drugs that are used to treat PD, conversely, may produce excessive dopamine activity, allowing motor systems to be activated at inappropriate times and thereby producing [[dyskinesia]]s.<ref name="pmid18781672"/>

==Diagnosis==
A physician will initially assess for Parkinson's disease with a careful [[medical history]] and [[neurological examination]].<ref name=Jankovic2008/> People may be given levodopa, with any resulting improvement in motor impairment helping to confirm the PD diagnosis. The finding of Lewy bodies in the midbrain on [[autopsy]] is usually considered final proof that the person had PD.

Medical organizations have created [[Medical diagnosis#Diagnostic criteria|diagnostic criteria]] to ease and standardize the diagnostic process, especially in the early stages of the disease. The most widely known criteria come from the UK Queen Square Brain Bank for Neurological Disorders and the U.S. [[National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke]]. The Queen Square Brain Bank criteria require slowness of movement (bradykinesia) plus either rigidity, resting tremor, or postural instability. Other possible causes of these symptoms need to be ruled out. Finally, three or more of the following supportive features are required during onset or evolution: unilateral onset, tremor at rest, progression in time, asymmetry of motor symptoms, response to levodopa for at least five years, clinical course of at least ten years and appearance of [[dyskinesia]]s induced by the intake of excessive levodopa.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Gibb WR, Lees AJ | title = The relevance of the Lewy body to the pathogenesis of idiopathic Parkinson's disease | journal = Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry | volume = 51 | issue = 6 | pages = 745–52 | date = June 1988 | pmid = 2841426 | pmc = 1033142 | doi = 10.1136/jnnp.51.6.745 }}</ref>

[[File:Pharmacological treatment of Parkinson's disease.png|thumb|Pharmacological treatment of Parkinson's disease]]
There is no cure for Parkinson's disease, but medications, surgery, and [[Physical therapy|physical treatment]] can provide relief and are much more effective than treatments available for other neurological disorders like Alzheimer’s disease, [[motor neuron disease]], and [[Parkinson plus syndrome]]s. The main families of drugs useful for treating motor symptoms are [[L-DOPA|levodopa]] (always combined with a [[Aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor|dopa decarboxylase inhibitor]] and sometimes also with a [[COMT inhibitor]]), [[dopamine agonist]]s and [[Monoamine oxidase inhibitor|MAO-B inhibitors]]. The stage of the disease and the age at disease onset determine which group is most useful.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Connolly BS, Lang AE | title = Pharmacological treatment of Parkinson disease: a review | journal = JAMA | volume = 311 | issue = 16 | pages = 1670–83 | date = 30 April 2014 | pmid = 24756517 | doi = 10.1001/jama.2014.3654 | s2cid = 205058847 | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/282b19727fa648f2fdc92597a40713d3708ae092 }}</ref>

[[Braak staging]] of Parkinson's disease gives six stages, that can be used to identify early stages, later stages, and late stages. The initial stage in which some disability has already developed and requires pharmacological treatment is followed by later stages associated with the development of complications related to levodopa usage, and a third stage when symptoms unrelated to dopamine deficiency or levodopa treatment may predominate.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Parkinson's Disease : Non-Motor and Non-Dopaminergic Features|date=2011|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|chapter=The non-motor and non-dopaminergic fratures of PD|others=Olanow, C.

Treatment in the first stage aims for an optimal [[trade-off]] between symptom control and treatment side-effects. The start of levodopa treatment may be postponed by initially using other medications such as MAO-B inhibitors and dopamine agonists instead, in the hope of delaying the onset of complications due to levodopa use.<ref name="Nice-pharma">{{cite book| chapter=Symptomatic pharmacological therapy in Parkinson's disease| editor=The National Collaborating Centre for Chronic Conditions| title=Parkinson's Disease| chapter-url=http://guidance.nice.org.uk/CG35/Guidance/pdf/English| publisher=Royal College of Physicians| location=London| year=2006| isbn=978-1-86016-283-1| pages=59–100| url-status=live| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100924153546/http://guidance.nice.org.uk/CG35/Guidance/pdf/English| archive-date=24 September 2010| df=dmy-all}}</ref> However, levodopa is still the most effective treatment for the motor symptoms of PD and should not be delayed in patients when their quality of life is impaired. Levodopa-related dyskinesias correlate more strongly with duration and severity of the disease than duration of levodopa treatment, so delaying this therapy may not provide much longer dyskinesia-free time than early use.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Zhang J, Tan LC | title = Revisiting the Medical Management of Parkinson's Disease: Levodopa versus Dopamine Agonist | journal = Current Neuropharmacology | volume = 14 | issue = 4 | pages = 356–63 | date = 2016 | pmid = 26644151 | pmc = 4876591 | doi = 10.2174/1570159X14666151208114634 }}</ref>

In later stages the aim is to reduce PD symptoms while controlling fluctuations in the effect of the medication. Sudden withdrawals from medication or its overuse have to be managed.<ref name="Nice-pharma" /> When oral medications are not enough to control symptoms, surgery, [[deep brain stimulation]], subcutaneous waking day [[apomorphine]] infusion and [[enteral administration|enteral]] dopa pumps can be of use.<ref name=Pedrosa2013/> Late stage PD presents many challenges requiring a variety of treatments including those for psychiatric symptoms particularly [[Major depressive disorder|depression]], [[orthostatic hypotension]], bladder dysfunction and [[erectile dysfunction]].<ref name=Pedrosa2013>{{cite journal | vauthors = Pedrosa DJ, Timmermann L | title = Review: management of Parkinson's disease | journal = Neuropsychiatric Disease and Treatment | volume = 9 | pages = 321–40 | date = 2013 | pmid = 23487540 | pmc = 3592512 | doi = 10.2147/NDT.S32302 |type= Review}}</ref> In the final stages of the disease, [[palliative care]] is provided to improve quality of life.<ref name="Nice-palliative">{{cite book | chapter=Palliative care in Parkinson's disease | editor=The National Collaborating Centre for Chronic Conditions | title=Parkinson's Disease | chapter-url=http://guidance.nice.org.uk/CG35/Guidance/pdf/English | publisher=Royal College of Physicians | location=London | year=2006 | isbn=978-1-86016-283-1 | pages=147–51 | url-status=live | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100924153546/http://guidance.nice.org.uk/CG35/Guidance/pdf/English | archive-date=24 September 2010 | df=dmy-all }}</ref>

===Medications===
{{update|reason= {{PMID|32171387}} |date=October 2020}}
====Levodopa====
The motor symptoms of PD are the result of reduced dopamine production in the brain's basal ganglia. Dopamine does not cross the [[blood-brain barrier]], so it cannot be taken as a medicine to boost the brain's depleted levels of dopamine. However a [[Precursor (chemistry)|precursor]] of dopamine, levodopa, can pass through to the brain where it is readily converted to dopamine, and administration of levodopa temporarily diminishes the motor symptoms of PD. Levodopa has been the most widely used PD treatment for over 40 years.<ref name="Nice-pharma"/>

Only 5–10% of levodopa crosses the blood–brain barrier. Much of the remainder is metabolized to dopamine elsewhere in the body, causing a variety of side effects including [[nausea]], vomiting and [[orthostatic hypotension]].<ref>{{Cite book|page=10|title=Levodopa pharmacokinetics – from stomach to brain A study on patients with Parkinson's disease.|last=Maria|first=Nord | name-list-style = vanc |date=2017|publisher=Linköping University Electronic Press|isbn=978-9176855577|location=Linköping|oclc=993068595}}</ref> [[Carbidopa]] and [[benserazide]] are [[Aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor|dopa decarboxylase inhibitors]] which do not cross the blood-brain barrier and inhibit the conversion of levodopa to dopamine outside the brain, reducing side effects and improving the availability of levodopa for passage into the brain. One of these drugs is usually taken along with levodopa, often combined with levodopa in the same pill.<ref name= Oertel2017>{{cite journal | vauthors = Oertel WH | title = Recent advances in treating Parkinson's disease | journal = F1000Research | volume = 6 | page = 260 | date = 13 March 2017 | pmid = 28357055 | pmc = 5357034 | doi = 10.12688/f1000research.10100.1 |type= Review}}</ref>

Levodopa-use leads in the long term to the development of complications: involuntary movements called [[dyskinesia]]s, and fluctuations in the effectiveness of the medication.<ref name="Nice-pharma"/> When fluctuations occur, a person can cycle through phases with good response to medication and reduced PD symptoms ("on" state), and phases with poor response to medication and significant PD symptoms ("off" state).<ref name="Nice-pharma" /> Using lower doses of levodopa may reduce the risk and severity of these levodopa-induced complications.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Aquino CC, Fox SH | title = Clinical spectrum of levodopa-induced complications | journal = Movement Disorders | volume = 30 | issue = 1 | pages = 80–89 | date = January 2015 | pmid = 25488260 | doi = 10.1002/mds.26125 }}</ref> A former strategy to reduce levodopa-related dyskinesia and fluctuations was to withdraw levodopa medication for some time. This is now discouraged since it can bring on dangerous side effects such as [[neuroleptic malignant syndrome]].<ref name="Nice-pharma"/> Most people with PD will eventually need levodopa and will later develop levodopa-induced fluctuations and dyskinesias.<ref name="Nice-pharma" />

There are [[Modified-release dosage (medicine)|controlled-release]] versions of levodopa. Older controlled-release levodopa preparations have poor and unreliable [[Absorption (pharmacokinetics)|absorption]] and [[bioavailability]] and have not demonstrated improved control of PD motor symptoms or a reduction in levodopa-related complications when compared to immediate release preparations. A newer extended-release levodopa preparation does seem to be more effective in reducing fluctuations but in many patients problems persist. Intestinal infusions of levodopa (Duodopa) can result in striking improvements in fluctuations compared to oral levodopa when the fluctuations are due to insufficient uptake caused by [[gastroparesis]]. Other oral, longer acting formulations are under study and other modes of delivery (inhaled, transdermal) are being developed.<ref name=Oertel2017/>

====Dopamine agonists====
Several [[dopamine agonist]]s that bind to dopamine receptors in the brain have similar effects to levodopa.<ref name="Nice-pharma"/> These were initially used as a complementary therapy to levodopa for individuals experiencing levodopa complications (on-off fluctuations and dyskinesias); they are now mainly used on their own as first therapy for the motor symptoms of PD with the aim of delaying the initiation of levodopa therapy and so delaying the onset of levodopa's complications.<ref name="Nice-pharma" /><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Goldenberg MM | title = Medical management of Parkinson's disease | journal = P & T | volume = 33 | issue = 10 | pages = 590–606 | date = October 2008 | pmid = 19750042 | pmc = 2730785 }}</ref> Dopamine agonists include [[bromocriptine]], [[pergolide]], [[pramipexole]], [[ropinirole]], [[piribedil]], [[cabergoline]], [[apomorphine]] and [[lisuride]].

Though dopamine agonists are less effective than levodopa at controlling PD motor symptoms, they are usually effective enough to manage these symptoms in the first years of treatment.<ref name="pmid15172778"/> Dyskinesias due to dopamine agonists are rare in younger people who have PD but, along with other complications, become more common with older age at onset.<ref name="pmid15172778"/> Thus dopamine agonists are the preferred initial treatment for younger onset PD, and levodopa is preferred for older onset PD.<ref name="pmid15172778"/>

Dopamine agonists produce significant, although usually mild, side effects including [[somnolence|drowsiness]], hallucinations, insomnia, nausea, and constipation.<ref name="Nice-pharma"/> Sometimes side effects appear even at a minimal clinically effective dose, leading the physician to search for a different drug.<ref name="Nice-pharma" /> Agonists have been related to impulse control disorders (such as compulsive sexual activity, eating, gambling and shopping) even more strongly than levodopa.<ref name="pmid20123548">{{cite journal | vauthors = Ceravolo R, Frosini D, Rossi C, Bonuccelli U | title = Impulse control disorders in Parkinson's disease: definition, epidemiology, risk factors, neurobiology and management | journal = Parkinsonism & Related Disorders | volume = 15 Suppl 4 | issue = Suppl 4 | pages = S111–15 | date = December 2009 | pmid = 20123548 | doi = 10.1016/S1353-8020(09)70847-8 }}</ref> They tend to be more expensive than levodopa.<ref name="pmid15172778"/>

[[Apomorphine]], a non-orally administered dopamine agonist, may be used to reduce off periods and dyskinesia in late PD.<ref name="Nice-pharma"/> It is administered by intermittent injections or continuous [[Hypodermoclysis|subcutaneous infusions]].<ref name="Nice-pharma" /> Since secondary effects such as confusion and hallucinations are common, individuals receiving apomorphine treatment should be closely monitored.<ref name="Nice-pharma" /> Two dopamine agonists that are administered through skin patches ([[lisuride]] and [[rotigotine]]) and are useful for people in the initial stages and possibly to control off states in those in the advanced state.<ref name="Jankovic_book-Pharma">{{cite book|title=Parkinson's disease and movement disorders|publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins|year=2007|isbn=978-0-7817-7881-7|veditors=Tolosa E, Jankovic JJ|location=Hagerstwon, MD|pages=110–45|chapter=Pharmacological management of Parkinson's disease|vauthors=Tolosa E, Katzenschlager R}}</ref>

====MAO-B inhibitors====
[[Monoamine oxidase inhibitor|MAO-B inhibitors]] ([[safinamide]], [[selegiline]] and [[rasagiline]]) increase the amount of dopamine in the basal ganglia by inhibiting the activity of [[monoamine oxidase B]] (MAO-B), an enzyme which breaks down dopamine.<ref name="Nice-pharma"/> Like dopamine agonists, their use may delay the commencement of levodopa therapy in early disease, but MAO-B inhibitors produce more adverse effects and are less effective than levodopa at controlling PD motor symptoms. There are few studies of their effectiveness in the advanced stage, although results suggest that they are useful to reduce fluctuations between on and off periods.<ref name="Nice-pharma" /> An initial study indicated that selegiline in combination with levodopa increased the risk of death, but this was later disproven.<ref name="Nice-pharma" />

====Other drugs====
Other drugs such as [[amantadine]] and [[anticholinergic]]s may be useful as treatment of motor symptoms.

===Surgery===
[[File:Parkinson surgery.jpg|upright|thumb|Placement of an electrode into the brain. The head is stabilised in a frame for [[stereotactic surgery]].]]
Treating motor symptoms with surgery was once a common practice, but since the discovery of levodopa, the number of operations has declined.<ref name="Nice-surgery">{{cite book|chapter=Surgery for Parkinson's disease|editor=The National Collaborating Centre for Chronic Conditions|title=Parkinson's Disease|chapter-url=http://guidance.nice.org.uk/CG35/Guidance/pdf/English|publisher=Royal College of Physicians|location=London|year=2006|isbn=978-1-86016-283-1|pages=101–11|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100924153546/http://guidance.nice.org.uk/CG35/Guidance/pdf/English|archive-date=24 September 2010}}</ref> Studies in the past few decades have led to great improvements in surgical techniques, so that surgery is again being used in people with advanced PD for whom drug therapy is no longer sufficient.<ref name="Nice-surgery" /> Surgery for PD can be divided in two main groups: lesional and [[deep brain stimulation]] (DBS). Target areas for DBS or lesions include the [[thalamus]], the [[globus pallidus]] or the [[subthalamic nucleus]].<ref name="Nice-surgery" /> Deep brain stimulation is the most commonly used surgical treatment, developed in the 1980s by [[Alim Louis Benabid]] and others. It involves the implantation of a medical device called a [[Neurostimulation|neurostimulator]], which sends electrical impulses to specific parts of the brain. DBS is recommended for people who have PD with motor fluctuations and tremor inadequately controlled by medication, or to those who are intolerant to medication, as long as they do not have severe [[wikt:neuropsychiatric|neuropsychiatric]] problems.<ref name="pmid20937936">{{cite journal | vauthors = Bronstein JM, Tagliati M, Alterman RL, et al| title = Deep brain stimulation for Parkinson disease: an expert consensus and review of key issues | journal = Archives of Neurology | volume = 68 | issue = 2 | page = 165 | date = February 2011 | pmid = 20937936 | pmc = 4523130 | doi = 10.1001/archneurol.2010.260 }}</ref> Other, less common, surgical therapies involve intentional formation of lesions to suppress overactivity of specific [[wikt:subcortical|subcortical]] areas. For example, [[pallidotomy]] involves surgical destruction of the globus pallidus to control dyskinesia.<ref name="Nice-surgery" />

Four areas of the brain have been treated with neural stimulators in PD.<ref name=Dallapiazza2018>{{cite book | vauthors = Dallapiazza RF, Vloo PD, Fomenko A, et al| date = 2018 | chapter = Considerations for Patient and Target Selection in Deep Brain Stimulation surgery for Parkinson’s disease | veditors = Stoker TB, Greenland JC | title = Parkinson's disease: Pathogenesis and clinical aspects. | location = Brisbane | publisher = Codon Publications }}</ref> These are the [[globus pallidus interna]], [[thalamus]], [[subthalamic nucleus]] and the [[pedunculopontine nucleus]]. DBS of the globus pallidus interna improves motor function while DBS of the thalamic DBS improves tremor but has little effect on bradykinesia or rigidity. DBS of the subthalamic nucleus is usually avoided if a history of depression or neurocognitive impairment is present. DBS of the subthalamic nucleus is associated with reduction in medication. Pedunculopontine nucleus DBS remains experimental at present. Generally DBS is associated with 30–60% improvement in motor score evaluations.{{cn|date=August 2020}}

===Palliative care===
[[Palliative care]] is specialized medical care for people with serious illnesses, including Parkinson's.

Along with offering emotional support to both the patient and family, palliative care serves an important role in addressing goals of care. People with Parkinson's may have many difficult decisions to make as the disease progresses such as wishes for [[feeding tube]], [[non-invasive ventilation|non-invasive ventilator]], and [[Tracheotomy|tracheostomy]]; wishes for or against [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation]]; and when to use [[hospice]] care.<ref name="pmid24182372" /> Palliative care team members can help answer questions and guide people with Parkinson's on these complex and emotional topics to help them make the best decision based on their own values.<ref name="pmid20081638" /><ref name="pmid24195263">{{cite journal | vauthors = Casey G | title = Parkinson's disease: a long and difficult journey | journal = Nursing New Zealand | volume = 19 | issue = 7 | pages = 20–24 | date = August 2013 | pmid = 24195263 }}</ref>

Muscles and nerves that control the digestive process may be affected by PD, resulting in [[constipation]] and [[gastroparesis]] (food remaining in the stomach for a longer period than normal).<ref name="pmid19691125"/> A balanced diet, based on periodical nutritional assessments, is recommended and should be designed to avoid weight loss or gain and minimize consequences of gastrointestinal dysfunction.<ref name="pmid19691125"/> As the disease advances, swallowing difficulties ([[dysphagia]]) may appear. In such cases it may be helpful to use [[thickening agent]]s for liquid intake and an upright posture when eating, both measures reducing the risk of choking. [[Gastrostomy]] to deliver food directly into the stomach is possible in severe cases.<ref name="pmid19691125"/>

Levodopa and [[protein]]s use the same transportation system in the intestine and the blood–brain barrier, thereby competing for access.<ref name="pmid19691125"/> When they are taken together, this results in a reduced effectiveness of the drug.<ref name="pmid19691125"/> Therefore, when levodopa is introduced, excessive [[Protein (nutrient)|protein consumption]] is discouraged and well balanced [[Mediterranean diet]] is recommended. In advanced stages, additional intake of low-protein products such as bread or pasta is recommended for similar reasons.<ref name="pmid19691125"/> To minimize interaction with proteins, levodopa should be taken 30 minutes before meals.<ref name="pmid19691125"/> At the same time, regimens for PD restrict proteins during breakfast and lunch, allowing protein intake in the evening.<ref name="pmid19691125"/>

PD invariably progresses with time. A severity rating method known as the [[Unified Parkinson's disease rating scale]] (UPDRS) is the most commonly used metric for clinical study. A modified version known as the MDS-UPDRS is also sometimes used. An older scaling method known as the [[Hoehn and Yahr scale]] (originally published in 1967), and a similar scale known as the Modified Hoehn and Yahr scale, have also been commonly used. The Hoehn and Yahr scale defines five basic stages of progression.

Motor symptoms, if not treated, advance aggressively in the early stages of the disease and more slowly later. Untreated, individuals are expected to lose independent [[ambulation]] after an average of eight years and be bedridden after ten years.<ref name="pmid17131223" /> However, it is uncommon to find untreated people nowadays. Medication has improved the prognosis of motor symptoms, while at the same time it is a new source of disability, because of the undesired effects of levodopa after years of use.<ref name="pmid17131223" /> In people taking levodopa, the progression time of symptoms to a stage of high dependency from caregivers may be over 15 years.<ref name="pmid17131223" /> However, it is hard to predict what course the disease will take for a given individual.<ref name="pmid17131223" /> Age is the best predictor of disease progression.<ref name="pmid20495568"/> The rate of motor decline is greater in those with less impairment at the time of diagnosis, while cognitive impairment is more frequent in those who are over 70 years of age at symptom onset.<ref name="pmid20495568"/>

Since current therapies improve motor symptoms, disability at present is mainly related to non-motor features of the disease.<ref name="pmid20495568"/> Nevertheless, the relationship between disease progression and disability is not linear. Disability is initially related to motor symptoms.<ref name="pmid17131223">{{cite journal | vauthors = Poewe W | title = The natural history of Parkinson's disease | journal = Journal of Neurology | volume = 253 Suppl 7 | issue = Suppl 7 | pages = vii2–vii6| date = December 2006 | pmid = 17131223 | doi = 10.1007/s00415-006-7002-7 | s2cid = 35082340 }}</ref> As the disease advances, disability is more related to motor symptoms that do not respond adequately to medication, such as swallowing/speech difficulties, and gait/balance problems; and also to levodopa-induced complications, which appear in up to 50% of individuals after 5 years of levodopa usage.<ref name="pmid17131223" /> Finally, after ten years most people with the disease have autonomic disturbances, sleep problems, mood alterations and cognitive decline.<ref name="pmid17131223" /> All of these symptoms, especially cognitive decline, greatly increase disability.<ref name="pmid20495568"/><ref name="pmid17131223" />

==Research==
{{update|date=July 2020}}
{{See also|Parkinson's disease clinical research}}
There are no approved disease modifying drugs (drugs that target the causes or damage) for Parkinson's, this is a major focus of Parkinson's research.<ref name="Poewe2017" /> Active research directions include the search for new [[animal model]]s of the disease and studies of the potential usefulness of [[gene therapy]], [[stem cell]] transplants and [[neuroprotective]] agents.<ref name="Poewe2017" />

===Animal models===
PD is not known to occur naturally in any species other than humans, although animal models which show some features of the disease are used in research. The appearance of parkinsonism in a group of drug addicts in the early 1980s who consumed a contaminated batch of the synthetic [[opiate]] [[Desmethylprodine|MPPP]] led to the discovery of the chemical [[MPTP]] as an agent that causes parkinsonism in non-human primates as well as in humans.<ref name="pmid6823561">{{cite journal | vauthors = Langston JW, Ballard P, Tetrud JW, Irwin I | title = Chronic Parkinsonism in humans due to a product of meperidine-analog synthesis | journal = Science | volume = 219 | issue = 4587 | pages = 979–80 | date = February 1983 | pmid = 6823561 | doi = 10.1126/science.6823561 | bibcode = 1983Sci...219..979L | s2cid = 31966839 | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/0fa587e1e8aba5327f1de9237279c47477b9e12d }}</ref> Other predominant toxin-based models employ the insecticide [[rotenone]], the herbicide paraquat and the fungicide [[maneb]].<ref name="pmid19729209">{{cite journal | vauthors = Cicchetti F, Drouin-Ouellet J, Gross RE | title = Environmental toxins and Parkinson's disease: what have we learned from pesticide-induced animal models? | journal = Trends in Pharmacological Sciences | volume = 30 | issue = 9 | pages = 475–83 | date = September 2009 | pmid = 19729209 | doi = 10.1016/j.tips.2009.06.005 }}</ref> Models based on toxins are most commonly used in [[primate]]s.

===Gene therapy===
Gene therapy typically involves the use of a non-infectious [[virus]] (i.e., a [[viral vector]] such as the [[adeno-associated virus]]) to shuttle genetic material into a part of the brain. Several approaches have been tried. These approaches have involved the expression of growth factors to try to prevent damage ([[Neurturin]] – a [[GDNF family of ligands|GDNF]]-family growth factor), and enzymes such as glutamic acid decarboxylase ([[Glutamate decarboxylase|GAD]] – the enzyme that produces [[Gamma-Aminobutyric acid|GABA]]), tyrosine hydroxylase (the enzyme that produces L-DOPA) and [[Catechol-O-methyltransferase|catechol-O-methyl transferase]] (COMT – the enzyme that converts L-DOPA to dopamine). There have been no reported safety concerns, but the approaches have largely failed in phase 2 clinical trials.<ref name=Poewe2017>{{Cite journal|vauthors= Poewe W, Seppi K, Tanner CM, ''et al''|date=23 March 2017|title=Parkinson disease |journal=Nature Reviews Disease Primers|language=en|volume=3|issue=1|page=17013|doi=10.1038/nrdp.2017.13|pmid=28332488|s2cid=11605091|issn=2056-676X}}</ref> The delivery of GAD showed promise in phase 2 trials in 2011, but whilst effective at improving motor function was inferior to DBS.

Since early in the 1980s, [[fetus|fetal]], [[pig|porcine]], [[Common carotid artery|carotid]] or [[retina]]l tissues have been used in [[Cell-based therapies for Parkinson's disease|cell transplants]], in which dissociated cells are injected into the substantia nigra in the hope that they will incorporate themselves into the brain in a way that replaces the dopamine-producing cells that have been lost.<ref name="pmid20495568"/> These sources of tissues have been largely replaced by [[induced pluripotent stem cell]] derived dopaminergic neurons as this is thought to represent a more feasible source of tissue.  There was initial evidence of [[Mesencephalon|mesencephalic]] dopamine-producing cell transplants being beneficial, [[Double-blind#Double-blind trials|double-blind trials]] to date have not determined whether there is a long-term benefit.<ref name="hench">{{cite journal | vauthors = Henchcliffe C, Parmar M | title = Repairing the Brain: Cell Replacement Using Stem Cell-Based Technologies | journal = Journal of Parkinson's Disease | year = 2018 | volume = 8 | issue = s1 | pages = S131–37 | pmid = 30584166 | pmc = 6311366 | doi = 10.3233/JPD-181488 }}</ref> An additional significant problem was the excess release of dopamine by the transplanted tissue, leading to [[Tardive dyskinesia|dyskinesia]].<ref name=hench/> In 2020, a first in human clinical trial reported the transplantation of induced pluripotent stem cells into the brain of a person suffering from Parkinson's disease. <ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Schweitzer JS, Song B, Herrington TM, ''et al'' | title = Personalized iPSC-Derived Dopamine Progenitor Cells for Parkinson's Disease | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 382 | issue = 20 | pages = 1926–32 | date = May 2020 | pmid = 32402162 | pmc = 7288982 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMoa1915872 }}</ref>

The role of the [[gut–brain axis]] and the [[gut flora]] in Parkinsons became a topic of study in the 2010s, starting with work in germ-free transgenic mice, in which [[fecal transplant]]s from people with PD had worse outcomes. Some studies in humans have shown a correlation between patterns of [[dysbiosis]] in the gut flora in the people with PD, and these patterns, along with a measure of severity of constipation, could diagnose PD with a 90% specificity but only a 67% sensitivity. As of 2017 some scientists hypothesized that changes in the gut flora might be an early site of PD pathology, or might be part of the pathology.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Tremlett H, Bauer KC, Appel-Cresswell S, Finlay BB, Waubant E | title = The gut microbiome in human neurological disease: A review | journal = Annals of Neurology | volume = 81 | issue = 3 | pages = 369–82 | date = March 2017 | pmid = 28220542 | doi = 10.1002/ana.24901 | s2cid = 25394413 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book | vauthors = Klingelhoefer L, Reichmann H | title = Nonmotor Parkinson's: The Hidden Face – Management and the Hidden Face of Related Disorders | chapter = The Gut and Nonmotor Symptoms in Parkinson's Disease | journal = International Review of Neurobiology | volume = 134 | pages = 787–809 | date = 2017 | pmid = 28805583 | doi = 10.1016/bs.irn.2017.05.027 | isbn = 978-0128126035 }}</ref> Evidence indicates that gut microbiota can produce [[lipopolysaccharide]] that interferes with the normal function of α-synuclein.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Bhattacharyya|first1=Dipita|last2=Mohite|first2=Ganesh M.|last3=Krishnamoorthy|first3=Janarthanan|last4=Gayen|first4=Nilanjan|last5=Mehra|first5=Surabhi|last6=Navalkar|first6=Ambuja|last7=Kotler|first7=Samuel A.|last8=Ratha|first8=Bhisma N.|last9=Ghosh|first9=Anirban|last10=Kumar|first10=Rakesh|last11=Garai|first11=Kanchan|last12=Mandal|first12=Atin K.|last13=Maji|first13=Samir K.|last14=Bhunia|first14=Anirban|title=Lipopolysaccharide from Gut Microbiota Modulates α-Synuclein Aggregation and Alters Its Biological Function|journal=ACS Chemical Neuroscience|volume=10|issue=5|year=2019|pages=2229–2236|issn=1948-7193|doi=10.1021/acschemneuro.8b00733}}</ref>
