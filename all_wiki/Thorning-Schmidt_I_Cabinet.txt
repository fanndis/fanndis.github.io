{{Politics of Denmark}}
The '''cabinet of [[Prime Minister of Denmark|Prime Minister]] [[Helle Thorning-Schmidt]] '''was the [[Cabinet of Denmark|cabinet]] government of [[Denmark]] from [[2011 in Denmark|3 October 2011]]<ref name="Copenhagen Post"/> to 3 February 2014. It was a [[coalition]] between the [[Social Democrats (Denmark)|Social Democrats]], the [[Danish Social Liberal Party]] and the [[Socialist People's Party (Denmark)|Socialist People's Party]]. On 9 August 2013, [[Helle Thorning-Schmidt]] made a [[cabinet reshuffle]] and on 12 December 2013, she made a second [[cabinet reshuffle]]. The cabinet resigned on 3 February 2014, following the [[Socialist People's Party (Denmark)|Socialist People's Party]] left the government on 30 January 2014. It was succeeded by the [[Cabinet of Helle Thorning-Schmidt II]]

Because of the government's minority status and its dependency on the support of the opposition, [[Venstre (Denmark)|Venstre]], the government had to jettison many of the policies that it had given during the election campaign. Although critics have accused the government of breaking its promises, other studies argue that it has already accomplished half of its stated goals, blaming instead poor public relations strategies for its increasingly negative public image.<ref>{{cite news |title=Government on track but off message |quote=Governmental parties are taking a beating at the polls, but recent study shows they’ve accomplished half their goals [...] Many feel that the Socialdemokraterne-Radikale-Socialistisk Folkeparti (S-R-SF) government, which has been slipping further and further down in the polls, has not done an effective job letting the public know when it gets something right. |first=Ray |last=Weaver |url=http://www.cphpost.dk/news/politics/government-track-message |newspaper=[[The Copenhagen Post]] |date=May 18, 2012 |accessdate=September 20, 2012}}</ref>

==Government formations==
At the [[2011 Danish parliamentary election|parliamentary election]] on 15 September 2011, the governing [[Venstre (Denmark)|Liberal Party]] remained the single largest party with the addition of one seat while the Social Democrats lost a seat. However, a three-party coalition of opposition parties together with the supporting [[Red-Green Alliance (Denmark)|Red-Green Alliance]] won a larger share of seats than the incumbent [[Venstre (Denmark)|Liberal]]-[[Conservative People's Party (Denmark)|Conservative]] government and their supporting parties the [[Liberal Alliance (Denmark)|Liberal Alliance]] and [[Danish People's Party]].<ref name="Links">{{cite news|title=Denmark: Right-wing government defeated, Red-Green Alliance triples seats|author=Inger V.

She then tasked Social Democrat Helle Thorning-Schmidt with negotiating the formation of a new government. Rasmussen's cabinet remained in office as a [[caretaker government]] until 3 October, when Thorning-Schmidt's cabinet was sworn in making her the first female [[Prime Minister of Denmark|Prime Minister]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Denmark to get 1st female PM after left wins vote|url=http://www.dawn.com/2011/09/16/denmark-to-get-1st-female-pm-after-left-wins-vote.html|newspaper=[[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn]]|date=16 September 2011|accessdate=4 October 2011}}</ref> The [[Danish Social Liberal Party|Social Liberal Party]] and the [[Socialist People's Party (Denmark)|Socialist People's Party]] also became part of the three-party government.<ref>{{cite web|title=Danish PM-elect seen unveiling govt Sunday|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/10/01/denmark-government-idUSL5E7L10J120111001|publisher=[[Reuters]]|date=1 October 2011|accessdate=4 October 2011}}</ref> It was the first time the Socialist People's Party joined a government since its foundation in 1959.<ref name="Links"/>

On 30 January 2014 [[Annette Vilhelmsen]], the leader of [[Socialist People's Party (Denmark)|Socialist People's Party]] announced that the party would be leaving government, the result of extended turmoil over the proposed sale of [[DONG Energy]] shares to [[Goldman Sachs]].<ref>{{cite web|title=SF leaves government, Vilhelmsen steps down|url=http://cphpost.dk/news/sf-leaves-government-vilhelmsen-steps-down.8476.html|publisher=[[The Copenhagen Post ]]|date=30 January 2014|accessdate=30 January 2014}}</ref>

== List of ministers and portfolios ==
The Social Democrats had ten ministers including the Prime Minister. The smaller Social Liberal Party and Socialist People's Party each had six ministers.<ref name="Copenhagen Post">{{cite news|title=Here are Denmark’s new ministers|url=http://www.cphpost.dk/news/politics/90-politics/52255-here-are-denmarks-new-ministers.html|accessdate=4 October 2011|newspaper=[[The Copenhagen Post]]|date=3 October 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003184742/http://cphpost.dk/news/politics/90-politics/52255-here-are-denmarks-new-ministers.html|archivedate=3 October 2011}}</ref>
