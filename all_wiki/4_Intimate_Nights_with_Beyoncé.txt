'''4 Intimate Nights with Beyoncé''' was the second [[concert residency]] by American recording artist [[Beyoncé]]. Held during four non-consecutive nights in August 2011 at the [[Roseland Ballroom]] in [[New York City]], the concerts were part of Beyoncé's campaign in support of her fourth studio album ''[[4 (Beyoncé album)|4]]'' (2011). All the songs on the standard version of the album, excluding "[[Start Over (song)|Start Over]]", were performed by her to a standing room-only audience of 3,200. Beyoncé also sang some of her previous hits from her three prior studio albums as well as songs she recorded with former girl group [[Destiny's Child]] in the 1990s and early 2000s. Wearing a linky gold sparkling mini-dress, she was backed by four female dancers and a 20-piece female band including a [[Horn instrument|horn]] and orchestra section.

Tickets to the four concerts sold out in one minute. The first show, on August 14, 2011, received critical acclaim; Beyoncé's ability to perform under the circumstances of a smaller stage and a larger band was commended by contemporary music critics. A DVD of the show titled ''[[Live at Roseland: Elements of 4]]'', which features performances from the concert, and never before seen personal footage from Beyoncé, including her times with Destiny's Child, traveling and partying with family, Beyoncé's rehearsal of "[[1+1 (song)|1+1]]" backstage at ''[[American Idol]]'', other live performances and a sneak peek at her wedding dress, was released on November 21, 2011.

During a behind the scenes look into the show, [[Stage lighting instrument|lighting designer]] Nick stated that the big moments of the album will be accompanied by big lighting from behind Beyoncé for the "epic big scenes", as opposed to performances such as "1+1", where Beyoncé is bathed in a single [[Stage lighting instrument#Spotlights|spotlight]] above a piano.<ref name="rap-up4"/> In the second part of a behind the scenes look of 4 Intimate Nights with Beyoncé, it is revealed that Beyoncé was in charge of the orchestra's design and stage set-up, stating that a three level stage would be needed, allowing the back-up singers to be at the top and the orchestra to be on the same level as Beyoncé herself, as to allow viewers to see them.<ref name="rap-up5"/>

After "[['03 Bonnie & Clyde]]", the final song in the medley, Beyoncé began to tell the story of how her first album came to be, stating "[The label] told me I didn't have one hit song on my album. I guess they were kinda right. I had five!".<ref name="rap-up3"/> Beyoncé then continued with a slowed-down, jazzier version of "[[Crazy in Love]]" allowing the orchestra to augment rather than transform the tracks.<ref name="rap-up3"/> During the [[Ne-Yo]] penned "[[Irreplaceable]]," Beyoncé has the crowd assist her in her performance.

Beyoncé than begins to perform virtually all of ''4'', beginning with "[[1+1 (song)|1+1]]", where she is found kneeling atop a piano wrapped up in smoke and red hued lights, reminiscent to her performance on the ''[[American Idol (season 10)|American Idol]]'' finale.<ref name="billboard1"/> Beyoncé then continues down the original track listing of ''4'', following "1+1" with a rendition of "[[I Care (Beyoncé song)|I Care]]" where she whipped her hair to the "brooding" brass and "ominous" beat of the song, while "bringing the song to life with an immaculate vocals".<ref name="idolator1"/> "[[I Miss You (Beyoncé song)|I Miss You]]" begins with Beyoncé performing while seated, only to later be brought to her feet while altering the song's ending with additional vocals and instrumentation. "[[Best Thing I Never Had]]" follows afterwards, with a slight alteration in its melody. Beyoncé then sang "[[Party (Beyoncé song)|Party]]" as the crowd swayed their arms back and forth and stretched out the "y" to every other verse.<ref name="billboard1"/> Beyoncé than began harmonizing with the back-up singers for "[[Rather Die Young]]", before performing an up-tempo version of "[[Love On Top]]".<ref name="idolator1"/> Beyoncé would begin the countdown of "[[Countdown (Beyoncé song)|Countdown]]" later allowing the audience to finish the countdown from nine-to-one. "[[End of Time (song)|End of Time]]" and "[[Run the World (Girls)]]" had Beyoncé utilizing flamboyant light displays bringing elaborate routines to a smaller stage.<ref name="rap-up3"/> The show ends with the last song — the self-empowering ballad "[[I Was Here (song)|I Was Here]]" — with Beyoncé rephrasing the song's final chorus to say "Roseland, we were here."<ref name="rap-up3"/>

==Critical response==
[[File:Roseland2.jpg|right|thumb|Although the song garnered mixed reviews from contemporary music critics, "I Was Here"'s live performance by Beyoncé was received with positive critical reception.]]
Jason Newman of ''[[Rap-Up]]'' began his review, "For a singer long accustomed to stadiums, Sunday's show was the most intimate performance most fans would see from the ubiquitous superstar."<ref name="rap-up3"/> He highlighted how she "split the difference between hushed torch singer and stadium belter", and favored her ability to display both "stamina and vigor, which make for a stadium-perfect show".<ref name="rap-up3"/> Newman concluded, "The medley combined the quick blasts of a Las Vegas revue with the emotional candor of a singer-songwriter performing to a near-empty room. It was an odd, yet effective juxtaposition; a global superstar who could effortlessly shuffle between slick, bombastic R&B and awkwardly honest confessions of a tumultuous career. By the end of the set though, humility, as one expects from a singer with 16 Grammy awards and more than 75 million records sold worldwide, turned to sly confidence."<ref name="rap-up3"/> Jon Caramanica of ''[[The New York Times]]'' was impressed by the show, complimenting Beyoncé's performances of "underdog tracks" such as "Party" and "Love on Top".<ref name="nytimes1"/> He wrote:

<blockquote>
In her performance it's always clear that a finely tuned engine is at work, but what was refreshing here was that it was in service of a surprisingly casual manner. She made funny, exaggerated faces; twirled her hair (when it was not floating); and spoke to the crowd like a knowing buddy. She was working off a teleprompter for her between-song patter, but improvising frequently, and for the better ... Beyoncé persevere[s], with a voice that skips up octaves and still gains power, with words that are as compelling as they are straightforward, with legs that treat the stage floor like an enemy in need of a thorough stomping. Even in moments of uncertainty, these are her constants. They survive her missteps.<ref name="nytimes1"/>
</blockquote>

Erika Ramirez of ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' magazine wrote, "There aren't many artists in the world that can pull off a 90-minute set in [[Stuart Weitzman]] heels and leave a beyond packed audience satisfied to the point of not needing an encore. But that's Beyoncé."<ref name="billboard1"/> Nekesa Mumbi Moody of [[ABC News]] wrote that though Beyoncé has nothing to prove at this point in her career, "even queens need to show what it means to be royalty", making reference to her performances on 4 Intimate Nights with Beyoncé.<ref name="abcnews1">{{cite web|first=Nekesa|last=Mumbi Moody|url=https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory?id=14306822 |title=Review: Beyonce Showcases Her Dominance at Concert|publisher=[[Associated Press]] via [[ABC News]]|date=July 1, 2011 |accessdate=August 15, 2011}}</ref> He added that the show was a "dazzling rebuttal" to all negative chatter revolving ''4''.<ref name="abcnews1"/> Moody concluded, "She put her track record up for display along with her new material with a subtle but undeniable message that she is not to be doubted, or counted against."<ref name="abcnews1"/> Mike Wass of [[Idolator (website)|Idolator]] began his review by writing that "Beyonce never fails to amaze."<ref name="idolator1"/> He continued to praise her for "raising the bar for live entertainment with a flawless display", further writing, "The worldly pop icon's ability to bring new depth and texture to quality material is almost as impressive as her uncanny knack for connecting with the audience on an emotional level".<ref name="idolator1"/> Wass finished his review by making reference to Beyoncé performance of "I Was Here" – which lyrically revolves around leaving a mark on the world – by writing, "But the pop veteran can sleep easy. Mission well and truly accomplished."<ref name="idolator1"/>

Her quaking vocals beat her contemporaries and competes with legends', as does her dancing", and concluded, "I'm looking forward to seeing her in a bigger venue, where there's more space for her voice to soar, elbow room for her band to play, and room for her wild-child fans to dance."<ref name="music-mixmix"/> Dan Aquilante of the ''[[New York Post]]'' stated that after the Beyoncé's performances of the songs on ''4'' at the concerts, the album was to be rated a 10 out of 10.<ref name="nypost1">{{cite news|author=Aquilante, Dan |url=http://www.nypost.com/p/entertainment/music/beyonce_saves_best_roseland_oqhbZ0U4PJ5Om83AN1DEkP |title=Beyoncé performs songs from her CD '4' at Roseland Ballroom in NYC |work=[[New York Post]]|date=August 17, 2011 |accessdate=August 17, 2011}}</ref> He further wrote, "Where tunes felt lackluster and flabby on the recording, Beyoncé injected a vibrancy in the new songs that boosted the material to be almost the equal to some of her best and biggest radio hits."<ref name="nypost1"/> Yolanda Sangweni of ''[[Essence (magazine)|Essence]]'' magazine viewed the concert as a chance for Beyoncé to remind people that her "vocal chops" are what got her where she stands today as an artist, and concluded that Michael Jackson and [[Diana Ross]] would be very proud of Beyoncé's accomplishments and performances on 4 Intimate Nights with Beyoncé.<ref>{{cite web|first=Yolanda|last=Sangweni |url=http://www.essence.com/2011/08/17/beyonce-4-intimate-nights-concert-review/ |title=Beyonce Gives an 'Intimate' Performance in NYC |work=Essence |date=August 17, 2011|accessdate=September 1, 2011}}</ref>
