'''Lobectomy of the lung''' is a [[surgery|surgical]] operation where a [[lobe (anatomy)|lobe]] of the [[lung]] is removed.<ref name="isbn0-8036-1561-2">{{cite book |author1=Biderman, Arthur |author2=Venes, Donald |author3=Taber, Clarence Wilbur |title=Taber's cyclopedic medical dictionary |publisher=F.A.

In addition to cancer, a lobectomy can also help to treat such things as a fungal infection, [[emphysema]] and [[tuberculosis]].<ref name="healthline.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.healthline.com/health/lobectomy#Administration3|title=What is a lobectomy?|publisher=Healthline|date=2014-01-28}}</ref>

==Administration==

The most common type of lobectomy is known as a thoracotomy.  When this type of surgery is done the chest is opened up.  An incision will be made on the side of the chest where the affected area of the lung is located. The incision will be in between the two ribs located in that area.  The surgeon will then be able to have access to the chest cavity once the two involved ribs have been pried open. The surgeon will then be able to remove the lobe where the problem is contained.<ref name="hopkinsmedicine.org">{{cite web|url=http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/healthlibrary/test_procedures/pulmonary/lobectomy_92,P07749|title=Lobectomy - Johns Hopkins Medicine Health Library|publisher=}}</ref><ref name="healthline.com"/>
Another way a lobectomy can be performed is through a video assisted surgery.  With this type the surgeon does not need to pry the two ribs open in order to get in.  A few small incisions are made and surgical tools are inserted into the chest cavity.  A small camera with a light will then be inserted.  What the camera sees will be projected onto a screen that the surgeon can see. Once the problem area is located the small tools that were previously inserted will be utilized to perform the surgery.<ref name="hopkinsmedicine.org"/> Once the surgery is complete, the patient will remain in the intensive care unit of the hospital for a day. They will then remain in a regular hospital room for about 4 to 7 days.<ref name="about.com">{{cite web|url=http://lungcancer.about.com/od/treatmentoflungcancer/a/lobectomy.htm|title=What is a Lobectomy and What Can You Expect?|publisher=About.com}}</ref>

== Risks==

As with any surgery, complications may occur.  The most common problems a patient runs the risk of because of this surgery include infections, reactions to anesthesia, bleeding, [[pneumothorax]] and [[bronchopleural fistula]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.merckmanuals.com/professional/pulmonary-disorders/diagnostic-pulmonary-procedures/thoracotomy|title=Thoracotomy|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150422041641/http://www.merckmanuals.com/professional/pulmonary-disorders/diagnostic-pulmonary-procedures/thoracotomy|archivedate=April 22, 2015|author=Noah Lechtzin|publisher=Merck Manuals}}</ref> The main infection that a patient runs the risk of is [[pneumonia]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lungcancer.about.com/od/treatmentoflungcancer/a/lobectomycomplications.htm|title=What Complications Can You Experience After a Lobectomy?|publisher=About.com}}</ref>  Pneumothorax occurs when there is air trapped between the lung and the chest wall. This can lead to the patients lung collapsing.<ref name="healthline.com1">{{cite web|url=http://www.healthline.com/health/lobectomy#benefits|title=What are the benefits of a lobectomy|publisher=Healthline|date=2014-01-28}}</ref>  A bronchopleural fistula is when there is a tube like opening that allows air to escape.<ref name="healthline.com1"/> 
Patients undergoing pulmonary resections often present postoperative air leaks.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Venuta|first1=F|last2=Rendina|first2=EA|last3=De Giacomo|first3=T|last4=Flaishman|first4=I|last5=Guarino|first5=E|last6=Ciccone|first6=AM|last7=Ricci|first7=C|title=Technique to reduce air leaks after pulmonary lobectomy.|journal=European Journal of Cardio-Thoracic Surgery|date=April 1998|volume=13|issue=4|pages=361–4|pmid=9641332|doi=10.1016/s1010-7940(98)00038-4|doi-access=free}}</ref>

==After==

Once the surgery is complete, the patient will remain in the intensive care unit of the hospital for a day. They will then remain in a regular hospital room for about 4 to 7 days.<ref name="about.com"/>  After the patient returns home they usually must remain in recovery for about four to six weeks, although some patients may be able to return to work/normal activities not long after returning home from the hospital.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.healthline.com/health/lobectomy#outlook|title=What is the outlook?|publisher=Healthline|date=2014-01-28}}</ref>  Pain is very common amongst patients for quite some time after a lobectomy.  Patients can talk to their doctors about how to manage their pain while recovery at home and doctors will prescribe pain medication to help with this.<ref name="webmd.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.webmd.com/lung-cancer/lung-surgery-thoracotomy-for-lung-cancer|title=Lung Surgery for Lung Cancer|publisher=webmd.com}}</ref>  Chest tubes are left inside of the patient in order to help excess fluid drain.  These will be removed by a doctor in a few days.  In order for chest tubes to be removed doctors must ensure that there is no longer fluid leaking from them along with no air leaking.<ref name="webmd.com"/>  In addition to this, follow up appointments will be scheduled with the patients doctor.  X-rays will be taken of the patient's lung to make sure everything is healing properly.<ref name="healthline.com2">{{cite web|url=http://www.healthline.com/health/lobectomy#preparation|title=How should you prepare for a lobectomy?|publisher=Healthline|date=2014-01-28}}</ref>  Patients that have had a lobectomy with no major risks shall recover in no longer than three months.<ref name="healthline.com2"/>
