==Early political career==

===Soviet war in Afghanistan===
{{main|Soviet–Afghan War}}

In September 1985, Abdullah became the head of the Health Department for the Panjshir Resistance Front, coordinating treatments and health care for the resistance fighters and the civilian population.<ref name=":0" /> He became a close associate and adviser to [[Mujahideen]] commander [[Ahmad Shah Massoud]] in the [[Soviet–Afghan War]].<ref name="profile">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/1672882.stm|title=Profile: Abdullah Abdullah|date=22 March 2006|work=BBC News|access-date=2009-05-15| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090512185350/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/1672882.stm| archive-date= 12 May 2009 | url-status= live}}</ref>

===Islamic State of Afghanistan===
{{main|Islamic State of Afghanistan|3=Peshawar Accord}}

After the fall of the [[Democratic Republic of Afghanistan|communist government]] in 1992, the [[Peshawar Accord]] established the [[Islamic State of Afghanistan]] with a [[provisional government]] led by [[Burhanuddin Rabbani]]. Abdullah was appointed [[chief of staff]] and spokesperson of the [[Ministry of Defense (Afghanistan)|Ministry of Defense]].<ref name=":0" />

===United Islamic Front===
{{main|Northern Alliance|3 = Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan}}On September 27, 1996, the [[Taliban]] seized power in Kabul and 90% of the country with military training support by [[Pakistan]] and established the [[Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan]].<ref>Coll, ''Ghost Wars'' (New York: Penguin, 2005), 14.</ref> 
Following the capture of Kabul by the [[Taliban]], the [[Northern Alliance]] was created under the leadership of Ahmad Shah Massoud, The NA was supported by Russia, Iran and India. Dr. Abdullah became the United Front's Minister of Foreign Affairs. [[Islamic State of Afghanistan]] elements of the United Front, including the Defense Minister Ahmad Shah Massoud and the Foreign Minister Abdullah Abdullah, remained Afghanistan's internationally recognized government. The Taliban government was recognized by only three countries – [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Pakistan]], and the [[United Arab Emirates]].

In early 2001, Abdullah traveled with Ahmad Shah Massoud to Brussels, where Massoud addressed the [[European Parliament]] asking the [[international community]] to provide humanitarian help to the people of Afghanistan.<ref name="EU Parliament (2)">{{cite web |year=2001|url =https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t78N6Q5VD60|title = Massoud in the European Parliament 2001| publisher = EU media}}</ref> Dr. Abdullah translated when Massoud stated that the Taliban and [[al-Qaeda]] had introduced "a very wrong perception of Islam" and that without the support of Pakistan and [[Osama bin Laden|Bin Laden]], the Taliban would not be able to sustain their military campaign for up to a year.<ref name="EU Parliament (2)"/>

===Foreign ministry===
[[File:Ghani-Ahady-Abdullah-2009.jpg|thumb|From left to right: [[Ashraf Ghani]], [[Anwar ul-Haq Ahady]], and Abdullah. (April 2009)]]

In October 2001 the Taliban regime was overthrown by [[Operation Enduring Freedom]] including American and [[Northern Alliance|United Front]] forces. As a result of the [[International Conference on Afghanistan, Bonn (2001)|International Conference on Afghanistan]] in Bonn in 2001, Abdullah was appointed Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Interim Administration in December 2001.

In November 2001, a diplomatic crisis unfolded when the British government, without any forewarning or seeking permission from the Northern Alliance, flew members of the British [[Special Boat Service]] to [[Bagram]]. Abdullah was "apoplectic" as he considered the uninvited arrival to be a violation of sovereignty, and complained bitterly to the head of the [[CIA]] field office, threatening to resign if the British did not withdraw. British [[Foreign Secretary]] [[Jack Straw]] tried to reassure the Northern Alliance that the deployment was not a vanguard of a British peacekeeping army, but Northern Alliance leaders did not believe them; with the threat of the Northern Alliance opening fire on incoming [[Royal Air Force]] troop transports, the deployment was put on hold.<ref>Farrell, Theo, ''Unwinnable: Britain’s War in Afghanistan, 2001–2014'', Bodley Head, 2017 {{ISBN|1847923461|978-1847923462}}, P.81-82</ref>

Following the [[2004 Afghan presidential election]], Abdullah was one of the few people who kept their position from the Transitional Government and was re-appointed as Minister of Foreign Affairs for another year. In 2005 he resigned his position.<ref name="new cabinet">{{cite news|url=http://pakistantimes.net/2004/12/24/top5.htm |title=Afghan President Karzai appoints new cabinet |date=24 December 2004 |work=Pakistan Times |access-date=2009-05-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090517044236/http://pakistantimes.net/2004/12/24/top5.htm |archive-date=17 May 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

===2009 presidential election ===
On May 6, 2009, Abdullah registered as an Independent candidate for the [[2009 Afghan presidential election]], running against incumbent president [[Hamid Karzai]]. Abdullah selected as his running mates Humayun Shah Asefi as his First Vice President and Dr. Cheragh Ali Cheragh (a surgeon from Kabul who is a practicing [[Shia Islam|Shi'i Muslim]]) as Second Vice President. Afghanistan has an [[Executive (government)|executive structure]] featuring two [[vice president]]s, a First VP and a Second VP, to help ensure a stable government by attempting to provide ethnic and religious balance to senior government leadership positions. Unofficial and non-certified electoral results were announced during the day on September 16, 2009, showing that Abdullah was in second position with 27.8% of the total votes cast. President Karzai did not achieve the 50.01% vote majority required to avoid a runoff election. A large number of fraudulent ballots, mostly belonging to Karzai's camp, were disallowed by the Independent Afghan Electoral Commission. Karzai came under intense international political and diplomatic pressure from  international leaders because of allegations of large-scale fraud. Hamid Karzai eventually agreed to participate in a designated head-to-head runoff election (held between the contenders with the two largest numbers of total votes in the first election) which was scheduled nationwide for November 7, 2009.<ref>{{cite magazine  | url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1925090,00.html?xid=rss-topstories  | title=Why Karzai's Rival Abdullah Won't Budge on Runoff  | access-date=2009-09-21  | magazine=Time | date=September 21, 2009}}</ref>

On November 1, 2009, Abdullah announced that he had decided to withdraw from the runoff election, citing his lack of faith in the President Karzai government's ability to hold a "fair and transparent" second election process. Subsequently, Hamid Karzai was declared the winner by the Afghan Electoral Commission (essentially winning by default).

===National Coalition of Afghanistan===

After the 2009 Afghan Presidential Elections, Abdullah created the Coalition for Change and Hope (CCH). The NCA presented the leading democratic opposition movement against the government of Hamid Karzai.<ref name="Reuters"/><ref name="Khaama Press"/>

In the September 18, 2010 parliamentary election, the Coalition for Change and Hope won more than 90 seats out of 249 seats, becoming the main opposition party.<ref name="Reuters"/><ref name="Khaama Press"/> As a result, it is assumed that the new Parliament will introduce some checks and balances on the Presidential power.<ref name="Reuters"/><ref name="Khaama Press"/>

Regarding the [[Taliban]] insurgency and Karzai's strategy of negotiations Dr. Abdullah stated:
{{quote|I should say that Taliban are not fighting in order to be accommodated. They are fighting in order to bring the state down. So it's a futile exercise, and it's just misleading. ... There are groups that will fight to the death. Whether we like to talk to them or we don't like to talk to them, they will continue to fight. So, for them, I don't think that we have a way forward with talks or negotiations or contacts or anything as such. Then we have to be prepared to tackle and deal with them militarily. In terms of the Taliban on the ground, there are lots of possibilities and opportunities that with the help of the people in different parts of the country, we can attract them to the peace process; provided, we create a favorable environment on this side of the line.<ref name="National Public Radio (NPR)">{{Cite news| url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=130757482| work=National Public Radio (NPR)| title=Abdullah Abdullah: Talks With Taliban Futile | date=2010-10-22}}</ref>}}

In December 2011, the [[National Coalition of Afghanistan]], supported by dozens of Afghan political parties and led by Abdullah, was formed to challenge the government of President Hamid Karzai. Major figures associated with the coalition include [[Yunus Qanuni]] (the former head of the Afghan Parliament), Homayoon Shah-asefi (a former presidential candidate and leader of the monarchist party with ties to the family of former king Mohammed Zahir, Noorolhagh Oloumi (a senior political figure in the former Afghan communist government), [[Ahmad Wali Massoud]] (a younger brother of [[Ahmad Shah Massoud]]) and several current Members of Parliament.<ref name="Eurasia Review"/>

===Massoud Foundation===
Abdullah has been the Secretary General of the Massoud Foundation since June 2006. The Massoud Foundation is an independent, non-aligned, non-profitable and non-political organization established by people who have been affected by the life of Massoud. It provides humanitarian assistance to Afghans especially in the fields of health care and education. It also runs programs in the fields of culture, construction, agriculture and welfare.

{{Further|2014 Afghan presidential election}}
On 1 October 2013, Abdullah officially announced his nomination for the [[2014 Afghan presidential election|presidential election]] held on 5 April 2014. On 13 April, BBC News reported that the counting indicated that Abdullah had thus far received 44.65% of the vote, with [[Ashraf Ghani]] following behind with 33.6%.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-27009936| title=Afghan poll: Abdullah slightly ahead as count continues| date=April 13, 2014| access-date=April 23, 2014| work=BBC News}}</ref> Abdullah and Ghani were then bound to compete in a [[run-off election]] in June 2014.<ref name=Nordland>{{cite news|last=Nordland|first=Rod|title=Afghan Voters Signaling a Turn|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/27/world/asia/afghanistan-elections.html|access-date=29 April 2014|newspaper=New York Times|date=26 April 2014}}</ref> The results of that election remained in dispute through until September 2014, with Abdullah claiming the government and the national electoral institutions manipulated the results. Pressure from the United States on the two candidates to resolve their differences, and to negotiate a power-sharing deal were initially agreed to, but Abdullah later remained defiant. A UN-led audit failed to sway Abdullah as he insisted the audit team could not explain a million extra votes counted in the run-off. Ghani supporters insisted they wanted to do a deal with Abdullah, and said they were leaving the door open to negotiations.<ref name="AbdullahDefiant">{{cite news|title=Abdullah insists he has won and refuses to accept vote audit|url=http://www.rferl.org/content/afghanistan-presidential-vote/26572385.html|date=8 September 2014|access-date=9 September 2014|publisher=Radio Free Europe}}</ref>
