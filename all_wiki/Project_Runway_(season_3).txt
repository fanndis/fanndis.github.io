'''''Project Runway Season 3''''' was the third season of ''[[Project Runway]]'', [[Bravo (US TV network)|Bravo]]'s successful [[reality show|reality competition]] for fashion designers.  The third season of the show, with [[Heidi Klum]] returning as the host and [[Tim Gunn]] as the designers' guide, began airing on July 12, 2006.  This broke tradition from the previous two seasons, which premiered in December, with the finales taking place at [[Olympus Fashion Week]] in February.

Season 3 brought in a new set of sponsors, notably [[Macy's]] replacing [[Banana Republic (clothing retailer)|Banana Republic]]. [[National Broadcasting Corporation|NBC]] re-aired the first two episodes of ''Project Runway 3'' five days after their original [[Bravo (US TV network)|Bravo]] airings. The third season also introduced live viewer poll questions.  During the second half-hour of the first airing of each episode, Bravo posed a question to viewers pertaining to the current episode. Viewers could answer through the BravoTV.com website or through cell phone text message.

The winner, [[Jeffrey Sebelia]], received a spread in ''[[Elle (magazine)|Elle]]'' magazine, a mentorship with INC (Inter-National Concepts) Design, a year of representation by Designers Management Agency, a 2007 [[Saturn Sky|Saturn Sky Roadster]], and $100,000 to start a clothing line (furnished by [[TRESemmé]] haircare).

In 2012, [[Kayne Gillaspie]] and [[Uli Herzner]] later competed in [[Project Runway: All Stars (season 2)|the second season]] of the All Stars edition with Kayne placing 9th, and Uli placing 3rd.  In 2013, [[Mychael Knight]] and [[Jeffrey Sebelia]] competed in [[Project Runway All Stars (season 3)|the third season]] of the All Stars edition, with Mychael placing 8th and Jeffrey placing 7th.

'''Model selection process:'''
* Episode 1: Models were randomly assigned to designers.
* Episodes 2 and 4:  Designers chose their models, with the winner of the previous challenge choosing first and the other designers choosing in random order.
* Episode 3 and 6: The winner of the previous challenge was allowed to change his model. All other designers kept their previous model.
* Episode 5: Models were chosen in random order and picked their designers.  Two models were eliminated in this episode to match the elimination of one designer and the disqualification of another in the previous episode.
* Episode 7: Models are the designers' mothers and sisters; designers could not choose their own family member.
* Episode 8:  Designers chose their models, with the winner of the previous challenge choosing first and the other designers choosing in random order. Two models were eliminated because no models were used in the previous episode.
* Episode 9: New models were randomly assigned in Paris.
* Episode 10: Vincent and Angela were brought back, as were their models. Vincent's model Jia was involved in a bicycle accident and was not able to walk down the runway. Javi, a previously eliminated model, took her place. Jia was out for the rest of the competition while she recovered. All other designers used their models chosen in Episode 8.
* Episode 11: Designers chose their models from the remaining seven, with the winner of the previous challenge choosing first and the other designers choosing in random order. Because three designers were eliminated in the previous challenge, three models were eliminated for this challenge.
* Finale: Two previously eliminated models, Amanda and Alexandra, were used in two of the final designers' collections. Amanda was used in Uli's final collection, and Alexandra was used in Michael's final collection.

*DISQUALIFIED: Keith
*First aired August 2, 2006

====Designer disqualification====

Keith Michael Rizza was found to have guides that could potentially be used as outside resources in a closed competition. These guides included fashion "how-to" books including basic pattern making textbooks as well as fashion history books. Keith claimed that although he did have the books in his possession, he never actually used them. Additionally, Keith left production unattended for several hours during promotional filming after a quarrel with the other designers. Keith left to go to his boyfriend's apartment to send an e-mail to Bravo's producer. However, this is also a means for disqualification because he used the internet. Any contact outside the competition is prohibited unless monitored by Bravo production. Any outside documents or materials related to fashion or fashion design are prohibited during competition. Once these claims were brought to the producers' attention, it was decided Keith knowingly broke the rules stated in a signed contract and was asked to leave the show. Keith Michael is the first Project Runway contestant to be disqualified from the series.
After his disqualification, Jeffrey Sebelia and Alison Kelly were the only team who lost their leader in this challenge.

===Episode 5: Iconic Statement ===
The remaining designers are asked to modernize a look for a "fashion icon" in just two days and US$150. The winner of this challenge will feature their look and model in a print advertisement for TRESemmé in ''Elle'' magazine. This challenge allowed remaining models to be randomly selected to choose a designer they wanted to work with. Models then chose a portrait that indicated the icon they wanted the designer to modernize. The fashion icons were: [[Cher]], [[Farrah Fawcett]], [[Pam Grier]], [[Audrey Hepburn]], [[Katharine Hepburn]], [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], [[Marilyn Monroe]], [[Jackie Onassis]], [[Diana Ross]], and [[Twiggy]]. The winner does not have immunity for this challenge.

===Episode 6: Waste Not, Want Not ===
The remaining designers are asked to create an outfit in just one day using only materials found at the [[Waste Management, Inc|Waste Management]] Recycle America Center in [[Port Newark-Elizabeth Marine Terminal|Port Newark]], [[New Jersey]] and US$25 for materials found at an art supplies store.

*WINNER: Michael
*OUT: Alison
*First aired August 16, 2006

===Episode 7: Everyday Woman ===
The remaining designers are asked to create an outfit for an "everyday woman" with just one day and US$150. The remaining designers' mothers and sisters are used as the clients and models for this challenge. Each designer cannot pick their own mother or sister.  The winner does not have immunity for this challenge. Most of the episode revolved around Jeffrey and his client, Anglea's mother, and the problems that ensued between the two. Jeffrey thought that she was trying to sabotage him, and he also opted to go in a different direction than she asked for after criticizing her taste.

*Judges: [[Heidi Klum]]; [[Nina Garcia]]; [[Michael Kors]]; and Joan Kors, Michael Kors' mother.
*WINNER: Vincent
*OUT: Robert
*First aired August 23, 2006

===Episode 8: High Flying Fashion===
The remaining designers are asked to create and model an "international jet-set" outfit for themselves in just one day and US$75. This challenge requires the designers to create garments that travel well and are tested for wearability as the designers are flown to Paris. There were two runway presentations; one in Paris for [[Catherine Malandrino]] judging wearability, and the New York panel.  The winner has immunity for this challenge.
Angela is the only contestant in all season who was not eliminated by Heidi, but by a guest judge.

*Judges: [[Heidi Klum]]; [[Nina Garcia]]; [[Michael Kors]]; [[Francisco Costa (designer)|Francisco Costa]], creative director for [[Calvin Klein]] women's collection; and [[Catherine Malandrino]], fashion designer.
*WINNER: Jeffrey
*OUT: Angela
*First aired August 30, 2006

===Episode 9: Couture du Jour===
[[Image:Jeffreydress.jpg|Jeffrey's winning dress|thumb]]
The remaining designers are asked to create an evening gown in just two days and €300 (US$375) employing [[Haute couture]] techniques. Designers workroom is held at Parsons Paris. There were two runway presentations: one for guest judge Catherine Malandrino with Parisian models, and the New York panel. The winner does not have immunity for this challenge.

*Judges:  [[Heidi Klum]]; [[Nina Garcia]]; [[Michael Kors]]; fashion designers [[Catherine Malandrino]] and [[Richard Tyler (designer)|Richard Tyler]].
*WINNER: Jeffrey
*OUT: Vincent
*First aired September 6, 2006

===Episode 10: Black and White ===
The designers are asked to create a cocktail dress using only black and white fabrics with only one day and US$100. An additional challenge requires designers to incorporate all of the fabric purchased into the outfit. Previously eliminated designers who have won at least one previous challenge are allowed back into the competition and are able to stay only if they win this challenge. Previously eliminated designers Angela Keslar and Vincent Libretti are invited back to compete. There was some controversy, especially towards Angela, who had won when teamed with two designers who were still in. Keith won the first challenge, so if not for being disqualified, he could have been eliminated and still played this challenge. Three designers are eliminated.
