'''Michael M. Kaiser''' (born October 27, 1953) is an American [[Arts administration|arts administrator]] who served as president of the [[John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts]] (2001–2014) in [[Washington, D.C.]]

Dubbed "the turnaround king" for his work at such arts institutions as the [[Kansas City Ballet]], [[Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater]], [[American Ballet Theatre]], and the [[Royal Opera House]], Kaiser has earned international renown for his expertise in arts management.<ref name="Tribune">{{cite web|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/chicagotribune/access/17414680.html?dids=17414680:17414680&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&date=Aug+11%2C+1996&author=Sid+Smith%2C+Tribune+Arts+Critic.&pub=Chicago+Tribune+(pre-1997+Fulltext)&edition=&startpage=12&desc=MAKEOVER+ARTISTRY+AMERICAN+BALLET+THEATRE+RECLAIMS+FINANCIAL+FOOTING+THANKS+TO+%60TURNAROUND+KING%27 |title=Sid Smith, "Makeover Artistry: American Ballet Theatre Reclaims Financial Footing Thanks to 'Turnaround King' ", '&#39;Chicago Tribune'&#39;, August 11, 1996 |publisher=Pqasb.pqarchiver.com |date=1996-08-11 |accessdate=2013-09-17}}</ref>

==Early life==
Born October 27, 1953, in [[New York City]], Kaiser grew up in [[New Rochelle, New York]], earning an undergraduate degree in [[economics]] and minor in [[music]] from [[Brandeis University]], [[magna cum laude]], and a [[masters degree]] in [[management]] from the [[MIT Sloan School of Management]]. His study of vocal music reflected an early passion for the arts, and while he hoped for a career as an opera singer he was, as he put it, "just dreadful".<ref>[http://mitworld.mit.edu/video/338/ MIT World at mitworld.mit.edu: "Kaiser abandoned his dream of becoming a professional singer after realizing he was "just dreadful"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080506064844/http://mitworld.mit.edu/video/338/ |date=2008-05-06 }}.</ref>

==Career==
Kaiser's early career focused on strategic planning and management consulting. In 1981, he founded [[Kaiser Associates]], a consulting firm whose clients included [[General Motors]] and [[IBM]]. But in 1985, spurred by his lifelong love of the arts, he sold his consulting firm to enter the world of arts management.

===Transition to arts management===
When he joined the [[Kansas City Ballet]] as general manager in 1985, the company was on the brink of bankruptcy. Within two years, Kaiser had revamped and energized the troupe's fundraising, and attracted critical attention and acclaim through ambitious programming initiatives. His leadership enabled the company to pay off the accumulated deficit, which had nearly led to its closure.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

Kaiser joined the [[Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater]] as executive director in 1991. The company faced extreme challenges, stemming from a $1.5 million accumulated deficit. Kaiser developed a strategic plan with the company's board and staff, targeting fundraising and marketing as key areas for overhaul. Recognizing the company's broad, international appeal, Kaiser set about putting the dancers before a much larger audience. In December 1992, the company was featured on ''[[The Donahue Show]]'', then the premiere daytime television program. In an unprecedented move, the full one-hour program was devoted to the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, an event viewed by 18 million Americans. In 1993, the company performed at President [[Bill Clinton]]'s inaugural gala, which was broadcast to an audience of 88 million. During Kaiser's tenure as executive director, the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater eliminated its deficit, increased the efficiency of its touring programs, and enhanced its national and international image.<ref name="Tribune"/><ref name="NYT">[https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FB0A14F838550C7A8CDDAB0994DC404482&n=Top%2fReference%2fTimes%20Topics%2fOrganizations%2fK%2fKennedy%2c%20John%20F%2e%2c%20Center%20for%20the%20Performing%20Arts Todd Purdom, "An Impresario With a Sideline: Rescuing Troubled Cultural Groups", interview in ''The New York Times'', December 9, 2004:] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120925012117/http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FB0A14F838550C7A8CDDAB0994DC404482&n=Top%2fReference%2fTimes%20Topics%2fOrganizations%2fK%2fKennedy,%20John%20F.,%20Center%20for%20the%20Performing%20Arts |date=September 25, 2012 }} 'For Dance Theater, he noted, the most acute problem — $900,000 owed to "the people who can shut you down," including insurers — was "nothing, not even in the scheme of Harlem, let alone New York." Within five or six weeks, Mr. Kaiser helped the company retire its debts, find a new executive director, expand its board and begin facing the future. "I needed to show troubled organizations around the country that you can fix your problems," he said. "I take very little credit for the actual implementation. They've done it." '</ref>

In 1995, Kaiser became executive director of [[American Ballet Theatre]]. With an accumulated deficit of $5.5 million, the company was struggling on the brink of closure. Ticket revenues were insufficient to meet the company's needs and the towering debt had reduced the board, management, and staff to a daily struggle to keep afloat, forestalling any strategic or long-range planning.<ref name="Auster">{{cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/usnews/culture/articles/030310/10kaiser.htm |title=Bruce B. Auster, "Turnaround Artist", profile in '&#39;US News & World Report'&#39;, March 2, 2003 |publisher=Usnews.com |date=2007-08-30 |accessdate=2013-09-17 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121007141324/http://www.usnews.com/usnews/culture/articles/030310/10kaiser.htm |archivedate=October 7, 2012 }}</ref>

Kaiser set about finding the large donations needed to reduce the $5.5 million deficit. He revamped the touring program, reaching out to cities across the United States as well as in Asia and Europe. He created new education programs to nurture both new dancers and new audiences. And he fueled aggressive new marketing programs, burnishing American Ballet Theatre's long-held reputation as a "company of stars." Within three years, the company had eliminated the entire accumulated deficit and established a surplus. After his success at American Ballet Theatre, the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' coined the [[sobriquet]] "The Turnaround King" for Kaiser.<ref name="Tribune"/>

In 1998, Kaiser assumed leadership of the [[Royal Opera House]] in [[London]], home of the [[Royal Opera, London]] and the [[Royal Ballet]]. In the midst of a major renovation, faced with a projected $30 million deficit, and flailing in a firestorm of criticism from the public, its board, and its patrons, the Royal Opera House was facing the most severe crisis of its history. Despite press reports predicting, even welcoming, the demise of the organization, and vitriol from patrons, Kaiser set to work, negotiating with the unions, placating the creative staff of the two resident companies, guiding the new facility through its final construction and problematic technical and stagecraft operations, and beginning the delicate work of repairing the institution's reputation as he worked to erase its debt. Within two years, the deficit was paid off, the new building paid for and opened, and an endowment fund established to protect the security of the Royal Opera House's future.<ref>[http://www.musicalamerica.com/features/?fid=131&fyear=2007 Tim Page, "Michael Kaiser: Impresario of the Year", ''Musical America'', musicalamerica.com online, 2007]: "...he cut ticket prices, erased a company deficit of $30 million, and completed raising the funds for a $360 million renovation."</ref>

===Kennedy Center===
In 2001, Kaiser joined the Kennedy Center as president. Unlike the organizations which had established his reputation as a savior of companies on the brink of disaster, the Kennedy Center was financially stable and not in need of a turnaround. But Kaiser set the goal of enhancing the Center's status as the nation's center for the performing arts, a destination for both American and international arts lovers.

His first undertaking was the "Sondheim Celebration", an unprecedented staging of six musicals by [[Stephen Sondheim]], within one season, under one roof: ''[[Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (musical)|Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street]]'', ''[[Company (musical)|Company]]'', ''[[A Little Night Music]]'', ''[[Sunday in the Park with George]]'', ''[[Merrily We Roll Along (musical)|Merrily We Roll Along]]'', and ''[[Passion (musical)|Passion]]''.<ref name="Auster3">Bruce B. Auster, page 2: "The good feeling can be traced largely to Kaiser's decision to produce six plays by Stephen Sondheim last year. This was no mean feat—"an impossible idea," says Chapin—given that the Kennedy Center had become a tour stop, a place where not even one play originated, let alone six sell-outs at a time."</ref>
Critical response to the Sondheim Celebration was extraordinary,
<ref>[[John Rockwell]], [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C00EEDE1E3AF93BA2575BC0A9649C8B63&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=3 "MUSIC; Sondheim Has His Shrine, and It's Not on Broadway"], ''The New York Times'', August 18, 2002: "In the meantime, when it comes to newly considered schemes to keep these masterpieces of American musical culture alive, Mr. Kaiser has shown the way"</ref> and the box office opened to record-breaking sales.
<ref>Paul Harris, [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb1437/is_200202/ai_n5932397 "WASHINGTON — Credit the Kennedy Center for helping to revive D.C.'s moribund tourism economy], which has been in the tank since Sept. 11. Its festival of six musicals by Stephen Sondheim registered a one-day record for single ticket sales Feb. 11. The box office sold $639,000 in tickets that first day at a $76 top... 
At week's end, sales had topped $3.3 million, including $2 million in advance subscription and group sales....", ''Variety'', February 2002.</ref>

Two other theatrical achievements were a retrospective of [[Tennessee Williams]]' work and a highly acclaimed celebration of the ten plays of [[August Wilson]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kennedy-center.org/programs/festivals/07-08/wilson/ |title=August Wilson 20th Century |publisher=The Kennedy Center |accessdate=2013-09-17 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140908230028/http://www.kennedy-center.org/programs/festivals/07-08/wilson/ |archivedate=2014-09-08 }}</ref> presented in sequential order.

Having set the bar high, Kaiser continued to upgrade the Kennedy Center's artistic profile, negotiating long-term agreements with the [[Mariinsky Opera]] and the [[Mariinsky Ballet]], the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]], [[New York City Ballet]], and the [[Bolshoi Ballet]] that ensured their regular appearance at the Kennedy Center; producing major festivals of the arts including "The Festival of China", "JAPAN: culture+hyperculture," and "Arabesque: Arts of the Arab World;" each bringing hundreds of international performers and artists to American audiences for the first time; and expanding the Kennedy Center's jazz and family programming.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} He has expanded educational programming, increasing the annual education budget to $25 million for programs reaching young people and adults—more than any other arts institution.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

Long committed to teaching and education, Kaiser has made the Kennedy Center a university of sorts for arts organizations and arts managers by founding, in 2010, the [[Kennedy Center Arts Management Institute]] to provide advanced training for young arts administrators and developing a series of programs to help train others in the field.
<ref name="Auster2">Bruce B. Auster, page 2:"This year 12 students from arts organizations around the world are studying to be arts managers. Each is writing a strategic plan for a minority arts organization that has teamed with the Kennedy Center, part of Kaiser's push to bring the performing arts to more communities."</ref> The Institute transitioned to the University of Maryland in September 2014, as the [[DeVos Institute of Arts Management]], based on a $22.5 million endowment from [[Dick DeVos|Dick]] and [[Betsy DeVos]], with Kaiser as Chairman.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://devosinstitute.umd.edu/Who-We-Are/Leadership|title=Leadership|last=|first=|date=|website=University of Maryland, DeVos Institute|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=22 March 2020}}</ref>

He has created a "capacity-building" program,<ref>[http://www.artsmanager.org/kcinstitute/capacity/organizations.cfm Kennedy Center Programs: Programs for Organizations<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724190619/http://www.artsmanager.org/kcinstitute/capacity/organizations.cfm |date=2008-07-24 }}</ref> that offers mentoring services to the leaders of 33 African American, Latino, Asian American and Native American arts groups from across the United States, and has instituted similar programs for over 250 arts organizations in New York City and 74 in the Washington, D.C. metro area.<ref name="Arts Management Programs">{{cite web |url=http://www.kennedy-center.org/capacity/#artsadvantage |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509145943/http://www.kennedy-center.org/capacity/#artsadvantage |url-status=dead |archive-date=2008-05-09 |title=Kennedy Center Arts Management Programs |publisher=Kennedy-center.org |accessdate=2013-09-17 }}</ref> He has established a [[fellows program]]<ref>[http://www.artsmanager.org/kcinstitute/individuals/fellowships.cfm Kennedy Center Programs: Fellowships<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071006184455/http://www.artsmanager.org/kcinstitute/individuals/fellowships.cfm |date=2007-10-06 }}</ref> for arts managers, enabling students and practicing arts managers to study at the Kennedy Center in a practicum that exposes them to the day-to-day work of the center's departments, from marketing and fundraising to programming and operations.

===Arts in Crisis===
Kaiser launched ''Arts In Crisis: A Kennedy Center Initiative'' in early February 2009, which provides free arts management consultation to arts organizations across the United States. Within 24 hours of unveiling the site, the program received 110 emails from 31 states.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB123500002830817227 |title=Wall Street Journal, February 19, 2009 |publisher=Online.wsj.com |date=2009-02-19 |accessdate=2013-09-17}}</ref> "[The initiative] is a high-tech support service through which arts administrators can talk to the Center's personnel about the challenges of shrinking income, budget-conscious audiences and other difficulties in keeping the doors open."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/02/03/AR2009020300900.html |title=Jacqueline Trescott, The Washington Post, February 4, 2009 |publisher=Washingtonpost.com |date=2009-02-04 |accessdate=2013-09-17}}</ref> ''Arts in Crisis: A Kennedy Center Initiative'' is a response to the emergency facing arts organizations throughout the United States.  The program, open to non-profit 501(c)(3) performing arts organizations, provides free and confidential planning assistance in areas pertinent to maintaining a vital performing arts organization during a troubled economy.  Over 100 experienced arts leaders from across the country are volunteering their time to serve as mentors to organizations in need. Since the initiative's launch in February 2009, the Kennedy Center has hosted symposia and arts community conversations in major cities across the country.

===Arts in Crisis: 50 State Tour===
In June, 2009, the [https://web.archive.org/web/20090907111119/http://www.artsincrisis.org/tour/ Kennedy Center launched a 50 state tour] supporting the Arts in Crisis initiative.  Michael Kaiser travels to cities in all 50 states, Puerto Rico, and the District of Columbia to lead arts management symposia.  At each event, hosted by a local arts organization, Kaiser addresses the challenges facing non-profit performing arts organizations in each city through such areas as fundraising, building more effective Boards of Trustees, budgeting, and marketing.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.artsincrisis.org/press |title=Arts in Crisis: A Kennedy Center Initiative 50 State Tour |access-date=2009-08-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303171804/http://www.artsincrisis.org/press |archive-date=2016-03-03 |url-status=dead }}</ref>
