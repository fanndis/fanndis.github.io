'''Adire''' ([[Yoruba language|Yoruba]]: tie and dye) textile is the [[indigo]]-[[dye]]d [[cloth]] made in southwestern [[Nigeria]] by [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] women, using a variety of [[resist dyeing|resist-dyeing]] techniques.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fashion-history.lovetoknow.com/fabrics-fibers/adire|author=Norma Wolff|title=Adire|website=Fashion History:Love to know|accessdate=25 December 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/a/adire-indigo-resist-dyed-cloth-from-yorubaland-nigeria/|title=Adire – Indigo Resist Dyed Cloth From Yorubaland, Nigeria|website=Vam|location=United Kingdom|accessdate=25 December 2014|date=2013-07-24}}</ref>

== History ==

The earliest pieces of this type were probably simple tied designs on cotton cloth [[Spinning (textiles)|handspun]] and [[weaving|woven]] locally (rather like those still produced in [[Mali]]), but in the early decades of the 20th century new access to large quantities of imported [[shirt]]ing material via the spread of European textile merchants in [[Abeokuta]] and other Yoruba towns caused a boom in these women's entrepreneurial and artistic efforts, making adire a major local craft in Abeokuta and [[Ibadan]], attracting buyers from all over West Africa. Abeokuta is considered to be the capital of adire making in Nigeria,{{citation needed|date=November 2019}} however some suggest that the large cities of Ibadan and Osogbo (Yorubaland) are more important in Adire making because Adire dyeing began in Abeokuta when Egba women from Ibadan returned with this knowledge.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Adire cloth in Nigeria|last=Simmonds|first=Doig|publisher=Doig D, Simmonds; Institute of African Studies, University of Ibadan.|year=2016|isbn=|location=Ibadan|pages=11}}</ref> The cloth's basic shape became that of two pieces of shirting material stitched together to create a women's wrapper cloth.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}} New techniques of [[resist dyeing]] developed.

The tradition of indigo dyeing goes back centuries in West Africa. The earliest known example is a cap from the [[Dogon people|Dogon kingdom]] in [[Mali]] dating to the 11th century, dyed in the ''oniko'' style.<ref name=":0" />

However, by the end of the 1930s the spread of synthetic [[indigo]] and caustic [[Sodium hydroxide|soda]] and an influx of new less skilled entrants caused quality problems and a still-present collapse in demand.  Though the more complex and beautiful starch resist designs continued to be produced until the early 1970s, and despite a revival prompted largely by the interest of US [[Peace Corps]] workers in the 1960s, never regained their earlier popularity. In the present day, simplified stenciled designs and some better quality oniko and alabere designs are still produced, but local taste favours "[[kampala]]" (multi-coloured [[wax resist]] cloth, sometimes also known as adire by a few people). However, there has been a recent revival of the Adire art by Nigerian artisans such as [[Nike Davies-Okundaye]],<ref>{{Cite book|title=Fashion Cities Africa|publisher=|others=Pool, Hannah, 1974-, Royal Pavilion, Art Gallery, and Museums.|year=2016|isbn=9781783206117|location=Bristol, UK|pages=98–99|oclc=946010715|last1 = Pool|first1 = Hannah Azieb}}</ref> who has inspired a younger generation of designers including [[Amaka Osakwe]] (and her label Maki-Oh) and [[Duro Olowu]]. Political figures and celebrities such as [[Michelle Obama]] and [[Lupita Nyong'o]] have worn adire-inspired clothes recently.

Today, there are three primary resist techniques used in Nigeria:
* '''Onikan''': this process involves tying raffia around hundreds of individual corn kernels or pebbles to produce small white circles on a blue background. The fabric can also be twisted and tied on itself or folded into stripes.
* '''Alabere''': Stitching raffia onto the fabric in a pattern prior to dyeing. The raffia palm is stripped, and the spine sewn into the fabric. After dyeing the raffia is usually ripped out, although some choose to leave it in and let wear and tear on the garment slowly reveal the design.
* '''Eleko''': Resist dyeing with cassava paste painted onto the fabric. Traditionally done with different size chicken feathers, calabash carved into different designs are also used, in a manner similar to [[Woodblock printing|block printing]]. Since the early twentieth century, metal stencils cut from the sheets of tin that lined tea chests have also been used.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title=Indigo Quilts|last=Triplett|first=Kay and Lori Lee|publisher=C&T Publishing|year=2015|isbn=978-1-61745-243-7|location=Concord, CA|pages=14–18}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ctpub.com/blog/adire-african-indigo-resist/|title=Adire: African Resist|last=Triplett|first=Lori Lee|date=14 October 2015|website=C&T Publishing|publisher=C&T Publishing|access-date=1 April 2016}}</ref>
Most of the designs are named, with popular ones including the jubilee pattern, (first produced for the [[silver jubilee]] of [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]] and [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]] in 1935), [[Olokun]] ("goddess of the sea"),<ref>{{Cite book|title=Adirẹ cloth in Nigeria, 1971-2016|last=|first=|publisher=Doig D.

Nigeria is also known for its two-tone indigo resist designs, created by repeat dyeing of cloth painted with cassava root paste to create a deep blue; the paste is then washed out and the cloth dyed a final time. Quality cloth is dyed 25 or more times to create a deep blue-black color before the paste is washed out. Additional forms of indigo resist-dyeing exist in other parts of West Africa; for example, the Bamana of Mali use mud resist, while Senegalese dyers use rice paste rather than cassava root, and the Ndop of Cameroon use both stitch resist and wax resist.<ref name=":0" />
