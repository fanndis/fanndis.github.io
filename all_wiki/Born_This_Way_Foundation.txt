The Foundation prioritizes the mental health and wellness of young people by working to promote kindness and open and honest conversations about mental health, validating the emotions of young people, and eradicating the stigma around mental health.

Furthermore, the Foundation works to "connect, engage, and inspire young people — on the road, in their communities, and online". The Foundation's programs focus on modeling healthy conversations about mental wellness, connecting youth with resources and services, and fostering communities that prioritize mental health.

In the documentary “Inside the Outside",<ref>{{Cite web|last=Peck|first=Jamie|title=Watch 'Lady Gaga: Inside The Outside' For The Gaga's Most Intimate Interview Ever|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/2298178/lady-gaga-inside-the-outside-mtv-documentary-video/|access-date=2020-06-12|website=MTV News|language=en}}</ref> [[Lady Gaga]] talked about being bullied herself and thrown in a trash can while classmates looked on. Lady Gaga often shares her personal experiences with the public, and has always hoped to “establish a standard of Bravery and Kindness, as well as a community worldwide that protects and nurtures others in the face of bullying and abandonment. She and her mother started BTWF to work with young people and provide the skills and opportunities they need to build a kinder and braver world.<ref name="Hughes">{{Cite web|last=Hughes|first=Sarah Anne|date=2011-11-03|title=Lady Gaga creates Born This Way Foundation to empower youth|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/celebritology/post/lady-gaga-creates-born-this-way-foundation-to-empower-youth/2011/11/03/gIQAUPEKiM_blog.html|access-date=2020-06-12|website=Washington Post|language=en-US}}</ref>

When Lady Gaga launched the Foundation with her mother in 2012, she stated to the Washington Post, “Together we hope to establish a standard of Bravery and Kindness, as well as a community worldwide that protects and nurtures others…"<ref name="Hughes"/>

In a PBS interview,<ref name="pbs.org">{{Citation|title=Healthy Minds with Dr. Jeffrey Borenstein {{!}} Youth & Mental Wellness: Lady Gaga Born This Way Foundation {{!}} Season 5 {{!}} Episode 1|url=https://www.pbs.org/video/youth-mental-wellness-lady-gaga-born-this-way-foundation-cobfnf/|language=en|access-date=2020-06-12}}</ref> Cynthia Germanotta stated that Lady Gaga was bullied at an early age and subsequently developed anxiety and depression, struggling with mental illness throughout college. As her career took off, she talked openly about her mental health challenges and the importance of kindness.

In 2016, Lady Gaga discussed the importance of kindness and compassion at the 84th Annual [[United States Conference of Mayors|U.S. Conference of Mayors]] in Indianapolis. She joined the [[14th Dalai Lama]] at the event to talk about building "compassionate cities" around the country. During her speech, Gaga told city representatives, "Kindness is a free currency from a well that will never dry up," and, "The most efficient way for you to act with young people is to be a calming force.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Stephens|first=Britt|date=2016-06-27|title=Lady Gaga Meets the Dalai Lama and Spreads Her Message of "Kindness and Compassion" to US Mayors|url=https://www.popsugar.com/node/41778649|access-date=2020-06-12|website=POPSUGAR Celebrity|language=en-US}}</ref>"

Cynthia Germanotta told PBS in 2018 that the Foundation was “built out of a lifelong passion to help young people. Our mission has always been to build a kinder and braver world … By creating safe communities for young people and offering skills and opportunities to empower them and inspire them...” In doing so, the Foundation focuses on promoting kindness, creating positive environments, and encouraging mental wellness among youth.<ref name="pbs.org"/>

Executive Director Maya Enista Smith additionally stated that the Foundation exists “to help eliminate the stigma surrounding mental health and equip young people to have those conversations that lead to that destigmatization.<ref>{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=September 6, 2018|title=Learning About Lady Gaga's Born This Way Foundation|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZEmCVz8PiI|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=|website=}}</ref>”

In October 2018, Lady Gaga was named as one of [[Elle (magazine)|''Elle'']]'s Women in Hollywood honorees. During her acceptance speech, she encouraged everyone to “work together to beckon the world towards kindness” and opened up about the PTSD she developed after she was assaulted at age 19. She additionally advocated for stronger mental health resources, stating she wanted to see mental health become a “global priority”.

“It is my personal dream that there would be a mental health expert teacher or therapist in every school in this nation and hopefully, one day, around the world,” Lady Gaga said. “Let’s lift our voices. I know we are, but let’s get louder. And not just as women. But as humans.”<ref>{{Cite web|date=2018-10-16|title=Lady Gaga Opens Up About Sexual Assault and Mental Health in Vulnerable ELLE Women in Hollywood Acceptance Speech|url=https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a23813974/lady-gaga-opens-up-about-sexual-assault-and-mental-health-elle-women-in-hollywood-acceptance-speech/|access-date=2020-06-12|website=ELLE|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Lady Gaga Moved to Tears During Emotional Speech on Sexual Assault, Mental Illness|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/rambling-reporter/lady-gaga-breaks-down-speech-sexual-assault-mental-illness-1152706|access-date=2020-06-12|website=The Hollywood Reporter|language=en}}</ref>

In November 2018, Lady Gaga accepted the [[SAG-AFTRA|SAG-AFTRA Foundation's]] Artists Inspiration Award, and in a 25-minute speech shared her own mental health struggles,<ref>{{Cite web|last=Malkin|first=Marc|date=2018-11-09|title=Lady Gaga Opens Up About Her ‘Mental Health Crisis’|url=https://variety.com/2018/scene/news/lady-gaga-mental-health-struggles-1203023093/|access-date=2020-06-12|website=Variety|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Lady Gaga Calls for Mental Health Care Support for SAG-AFTRA Artists|url=https://www.wmagazine.com/story/lady-gaga-mental-health-sag-aftra/|access-date=2020-06-12|website=W Magazine {{!}} Women's Fashion & Celebrity News|language=en-US}}</ref> advocated for stronger mental health resources in the industry by requesting SAG-AFTRA partner with the Foundation, and encouraged people to share their mental health stories.

“When I speak about mental health, even or especially when I’m speaking about mine, it is often met with quietness, or maybe a somber line of fans waiting outside to whisper to me in the shadows about their darkest secrets,” she said in her acceptance speech. “We need to bring mental health into the light. We need to share our stories so that global mental health no longer resides and festers in the darkness.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Lady Gaga Talks Suicide and Masochistic Behavior at SAG-AFTRA Foundation Gala|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/rambling-reporter/lady-gaga-talks-suicide-masochistic-behavior-at-sag-aftra-gala-1159825|access-date=2020-06-12|website=The Hollywood Reporter|language=en}}</ref>”

She additionally encouraged everyone to “live in a culture of kindness through our individual acts and take back what determines our future.”

==History==
[[File:Lady Gaga autograph.svg|thumb|150px|Lady Gaga's signature]]The organization was launched<ref>{{Cite web|last=Hughes|first=Sarah Anne|date=2011-11-03|title=Lady Gaga creates Born This Way Foundation to empower youth|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/celebritology/post/lady-gaga-creates-born-this-way-foundation-to-empower-youth/2011/11/03/gIQAUPEKiM_blog.html|access-date=2020-06-15|website=Washington Post|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Lady Gaga Launches Born This Way Foundation|url=https://abcnews.go.com/blogs/entertainment/2012/03/lady-gaga-launches-born-this-way-foundation-2|access-date=2020-06-15|website=ABC News|language=en}}</ref> on February 29, 2012, by artist Lady Gaga and her mother Cynthia Germanotta, who said, "challenge meanness and cruelty by inspiring young people to create a support system in their respective communities." Media proprietor [[Oprah Winfrey]],<ref>{{Cite web|date=2012-02-14|title=Oprah Teams Up With Lady Gaga for Born This Way Foundation Launch|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/506141/oprah-teams-up-with-lady-gaga-for-born-this-way-foundation-launch|access-date=2020-06-15|website=Billboard}}</ref> writer [[Deepak Chopra]], and [[United States Secretary of Health and Human Services]] [[Kathleen Sebelius]] spoke at the inauguration. The Foundation's original funding included $1.2 million from Lady Gaga, $500,000 from the [[John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation]], and $850,000 from retailer [[Barneys New York]].

BTWF was the beneficiary of Barneys New York's 2011 holiday campaign which also featured "Lady Gaga’s Workshop". In May 2012, [[Viacom (2005–2019)|Viacom]] announced it would be the Foundation's lead media partner for the development of events, programming and "opportunities that empower young people to build a braver, kinder world." In August 2012, Lady Gaga was named by American business magazine ''[[Forbes]]'' as fourteenth on their "World's 100 Most Powerful Women" list due in part to her BTWF work.

In 2018, Born This Way Foundation was the recipient of [[Girls, Inc.|Girls Inc.]]’s Champion For Girls Award and the Children Mending Heart’s “Global Changemakers” Award. That same year, co-founder of the Foundation Cynthia Germanotta was invited to speak at the [[United Nations General Assembly]] on behalf of the organization to discuss mental health and launch a new “United for Global Mental Health” initiative.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2018-09-26|title=Lady Gaga's Mom Cynthia Germanotta Addresses UN, Stresses the Importance of Mental Health Resources|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/8477134/lady-gaga-mom-cynthia-germanotta-speaks-at-unga|access-date=2020-06-15|website=Billboard}}</ref>

In March 2014, [[Roger Friedman]] of Showbiz411 criticized the Foundation's spendings reflected in their federal tax reports. The reports noted spending of $348,000 on its Born Brave Bus tour; approximately $1.5 million on fees related to Web and social media, publicity, and legalities, as opposed to only $5,000 in grants to individuals and other organizations. "It’s unclear that anyone was really helped by the Born This Way Foundation other than lawyers, consultants, publicists and travel agents," Friedman wrote. "We do the work," Lady Gaga wrote in response.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Michaels|first=Sean|date=2014-03-14|title=Lady Gaga denies claims regarding Born This Way Foundation funds|language=en-GB|work=The Guardian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/mar/14/lady-gaga-denies-born-this-way-foundation-funds|access-date=2020-06-15|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> "We do not raise money and allocate the funds to other charities for them to do the work.” “A clear understanding of the differences between a grant-making organization and one that carries out its work directly would have made this a non-story," Cynthia Germanotta added. "We are not a grant-maker that funds the work of other charities, and were never intended to be ... [But] we are having a profound impact in just a very short period of time.”

== Programming and Campaigns ==

=== Channel Kindness ===
On September 15, 2016, Born This Way Foundation launched a new program called Channel Kindness,<ref>{{Cite news|title=Born This Way Foundation to launch Channel Kindness in honor of Lady Gaga's 31st birthday, catch a sneak peek featuring 'Dear Evan Hansen' cast members|language=en-US|work=AXS|url=https://www.axs.com/born-this-way-foundation-to-launch-channel-kindness-in-honor-of-lady-g-116593|access-date=2020-06-15}}</ref> which is designed “to give youth a voice in a media landscape that too often ignores or misrepresents young people.” In creating this program, Born This Way Foundation recognized the absence of positive stories<ref>{{Cite web|last=Germanotta|first=Cynthia|date=2016-09-16|title=We Have Enough Bad News. It's Time To Channel Kindness.|url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/we-have-enough-bad-news-i_b_12030826|access-date=2020-06-15|website=HuffPost|language=en}}</ref> in today's media. Channel Kindness is designed to fill that void and provide individuals across the globe with some much-needed optimism and encouragement.

From 2017–2018, the program recruited and trained 100 youth reporters ages 15–24 from across the United States to recognize and broadcast acts of kindness they saw in their everyday lives and communities. Their stories are published on ChannelKindness.org and are spread across the program's social media channels.

In 2018, BTWF announced it would expand Channel Kindness, which is now open to anyone from across the U.S. and, for the first time, around the world to share their stories on the platform.<ref>{{Cite web|last=AyshaM|date=2020-04-11|title=Share Your Story: Channel Kindness Submission Guidelines|url=https://www.channelkindness.org/calling-all-storytellers/|access-date=2020-06-15|website=Channel Kindness|language=en-US}}</ref>

==== #MultiplyYourGood ====
In honor of World Kindness Day in 2018, Born This Way Foundation announced the launch of the #MultiplyYourGood Channel Kindness Challenge.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2018-11-13|title=Lady Gaga's Born This Way Foundation Launches #MultiplyYourGood Challenge|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/8484676/lady-gaga-born-this-way-foundation-multiplyyourgood-challenge|access-date=2020-06-15|website=Billboard}}</ref> With support from [[Zappos]], the campaign called on individuals to celebrate their power to make a difference by volunteering or donating to a nonprofit in their community. For every act of good performed during the challenge, BTWF pledged to “multiply” it by performing an act of good for one of the organization's nonprofit partners.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Brandi Neal|title=Here’s How To Take The Born This Way Foundation’s #MultiplyYourGood Challenge To Give Back This Holiday Season|url=https://www.bustle.com/p/born-this-way-foundations-multiply-your-good-challenge-wants-you-to-give-back-during-the-holidays-13190662|access-date=2020-06-15|website=Bustle|language=en}}</ref>

The Foundation's diverse network of partners, including [[SoulCycle]], which invited riders to take part, and [[Starbucks]], which hosted community events on [[World Kindness Day]] 2018 in ten stores nationwide, helped amplify the campaign. The in-store activations invited guests to participate in an activity that met the needs of a local nonprofits, such as collecting donated items or writing holiday messages for homeless youth.

Born This Way Foundation and United for Global Mental Health announced the launch of the #Someone2Turn2 Channel Kindness Challenge<ref>{{Cite web|last=Borge|first=Jonathan|date=2018-10-12|title=Lady Gaga's Mom On How Her Family Battles Mental Health Issues|url=https://www.oprahmag.com/entertainment/a23739868/lady-gaga-mom-born-this-way-foundation/|access-date=2020-06-15|website=Oprah Magazine|language=en-US}}</ref> to foster healthy conversations about mental wellness in honor of [[World Mental Health Day]] on Wednesday, October 10, 2018. Inspired by the work of the [[Friendship bench|Friendship Bench]] initiative, the #Someone2Turn2 challenged the public to have a real, honest, and open discussion about mental health with the person they turn to when they need support and then share who their #Someone2Turn2 is on social media.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Smith|first=Maya Enista|title=5 ways to talk about mental health that'll leave you feeling better|url=https://mashable.com/article/how-to-talk-about-mental-health/|access-date=2020-06-15|website=Mashable|language=en}}</ref>

Inspired by the idea that it takes 21 days to build a habit, the campaign culminated in 2018 on the [[International Day of Peace|U.N. International Day of Peace]] and inspired over 8 million acts of kindness. As part of #BeKind21, participants could take a pledge to make kindness a habit, as the campaign stems from beliefs that kindness can heal the world and when someone gives to others, they give back to their own wellness. In its second year,<ref>{{Cite web|date=2019-08-15|title=Lady Gaga's Born This Way Foundation '21 Days to Be Kind' Challenge|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/8527474/lady-gaga-born-this-way-foundation-21-days-to-be-kind-challenge|access-date=2020-06-15|website=Billboard}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Moyer|first=Phillip|date=2019-08-14|title=LIVE: Las Vegas launches annual '21 Days to Be Kind' with Born This Way Foundation|url=https://news3lv.com/news/local/las-vegas-launches-annual-21-days-to-be-kind-challenge-with-born-this-way-foundation|access-date=2020-06-15|website=KSNV}}</ref> Born This Way Foundation reported over 7,000 sign-ups and 1.6 million participants for the #BeKind21 campaign, partnering with over 130 organizations: schools,<ref>{{Cite web|title=Cool Schools: Kindness campaign underway at Model Elementary|url=https://www.abc57.com/news/cool-schools-kindness-campaign-underway-at-model-elementary|access-date=2020-06-15|website=ABC57|language=en}}</ref> nonprofits,<ref>{{Cite web|date=2019-09-02|title=MGM Resorts International Joins Lady Gaga's Born This Way Foundation For 21 Days to Be Kind Challenge|url=https://www.looktothestars.org/news/19255-mgm-resorts-international-joins-lady-gagas-born-this-way-foundation-for-21-days-to-be-kind-challenge|access-date=2020-06-15|website=Look to the Stars|language=en}}</ref> and corporations. Also in 2019, those who signed up for the campaign were encouraged to form “Kindness Teams” on which they could do kind acts as a group. The efforts of the 2019 #BeKind21 campaign resulted in over 40 million acts of kindness—up over 32 million from the year before—and it will kick off its third year on September 1, 2020.

=== #BeKindBeThere ===
<nowiki>#</nowiki>BeKindBeThere is a joint initiative between Born This Way Foundation and [[Jack.org]] to highlight Jack.org's program BeThere.org.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Jack.org|title=Lady Gaga's Born This Way Foundation and Jack.org Announce the #BeKindBeThere Initiative|url=https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/lady-gagas-born-this-way-foundation-and-jackorg-announce-the-bekindbethere-initiative-301059030.html|access-date=2020-06-15|website=www.prnewswire.com|language=en}}</ref> BeThere.org<ref>{{Cite web|title=Be There - Created by Jack.org|url=https://bethere.org/|access-date=2020-06-15|website=bethere.org}}</ref> aims to teach young people the skills necessary to support someone else's mental health while protecting their own. BeThere.org offers five steps, or “Golden Rules,” to support someone who is struggling with their mental health. These are: (1) say what you see by breaking the ice and starting a conversation, (2) show you care by building trust and supporting someone, (3) hear them out by being a good listener and balancing the conversation, (4) know your role by setting boundaries to protect your relationship and own mental health, and (5) connect to help by accessing professional and community resources. Promoted with video conversation between the two organizations and across all social media platforms with the hashtag #BeKindBeThere, these golden rules can be found in more detail on BeThere.org.

=== Emotion Revolution Summit at Yale University ===
On October 24, 2015, Born This Way Foundation and the Yale Center for Emotional Intelligence<ref>{{Cite web|title=Yale Center for Emotional Intelligence|url=https://www.ycei.org/|access-date=2020-06-15|website=Yale Center for Emotional Intelligence|language=en-US}}</ref> hosted the Emotion Revolution Summit<ref>{{Cite web|last=Mansfield|first=Brian|title=Gaga, Yale team up for Emotion Revolution|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/music/2015/04/09/lady-gaga-yale-emotion-revolution/25514969/|access-date=2020-06-15|website=USA TODAY|language=en-US}}</ref> to raise awareness of how much emotions play into young people's decision-making and wellness. The event consisted of round-table discussions, workshops, and speeches from a variety of educators and advocates, including Lady Gaga herself. Lady Gaga asked the over 200 young people at the conference to focus on and care for their own mental and emotional health. She invited them to join a movement addressing the importance of emotions on social media using the hashtag #IAmNotJust.

Born This Way Foundation and the Yale Center for Emotional Intelligence also collected data from these students and found that when students were asked how they currently feel in school, 75% of the responses were negative.

=== "What does bravery mean to you?" Campaign ===
From March 28 to April 11, 2012, the Born This Way Foundation ran a poster campaign<ref>{{Cite web|date=2012-03-30|title=Lady Gaga Launches Charity Poster Contest|url=https://www.looktothestars.org/news/8124-lady-gaga-launches-charity-poster-contest|access-date=2020-06-15|website=Look to the Stars|language=en}}</ref> to inspire bravery and encouraged supporters to submit images that answer the question, "What does bravery mean to you?" with the 10 semi finalists selected by Lady Gaga and her mother, and leading to a prize for the winner(s), selected by fans.

== Community Activations ==

=== The Channel Kindness Tour ===
From August 1, 2017, through December 18, 2017, Born This Way Foundation accompanied Lady Gaga on her [[Joanne World Tour]], visiting over 30 cities across the US and Canada. The Channel Kindness Tour included in venues activations, which allowed local nonprofits to connect directly with concert goes; communities conversations on mental health and services events; and Channel Kindness Awards which recognized eight youth across the country.<ref>{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=How Lady Gaga’s Born This Way Foundation is Spreading Kindness on the Joanne Tour|url=https://artistwaves.com/how-lady-gagas-born-this-way-foundation-is-spreading-kindness-on-the-joanne-tour/|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=|website=}}</ref>

=== Share Kindness ===
In 2016, the Foundation joined forces with [[Today (U.S. TV program)|''Today'']] and [[NBC]] with the goal to inspire 1 million acts of kindness before the end of the year. With the hashtag #ShareKindness, people were encouraged to celebrate empathy and generosity by committing an act of kindness for someone else in their schools, homes, businesses, and communities.

To help kick off #ShareKindness, Lady Gaga and her mother Cynthia Germanotta, visited the [[Ali Forney Center]], a shelter for homeless LGBTQ+ youth in Harlem in New York City.

Lady Gaga surprised the youth with gifts, encouraging messages, and led a meditation session alongside her mother. She encouraged the group with her mantra, “You are brave. You are courageous,” and concluded with a strong statement of gratitude to each of the youth: “Thank you for being alive.”

Lady Gaga also emphasized the value of kindness: “Kindness to me is an action of love or a showing of love to someone else and I also believe that kindness is the cure to violence and hatred around the world."<ref>{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=LADY GAGA’S BORN THIS WAY FOUNDATION LAUNCHES THE #SHAREKINDNESS EXPERIENCE IN PARTNERSHIP WITH TODAY|url=https://foodbanksj.org/2016/12/05/lady-gagas-born-way-foundation-launches-sharekindness-experience-partnership-today/|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=|website=}}</ref>

=== Born Brave Bus ===
The Foundation announced in May 2012 that the Born Brave Bus would follow Lady Gaga on tour as an initiative to inspire bravery, empower the youth, and connect young people to resources in their community. In June 2012, "Born Brave" communities and school groups, dedicated to making a positive change where they live. Born Brave Nation, a name chosen by Born This Way Foundation supporters, requested founding members in July 2012, but the bus had not yet launched. The Foundation partnered with community organizations like [[Campus Pride]], [[GLSEN]], the [[National Association of School Psychologists]] and [[Youth Service America]] to connect young people to the resources in their communities.<ref>{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=Lady Gaga’s Born Brave Bus Tour Back on the Road|url=https://www.thenationalcouncil.org/press-releases/lady-gagas-born-brave-bus-tour-back-on-the-road/|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=|website=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=LADY GAGA UNVEILS BORN BRAVE BUS AT KICKOFF OF U.S. TOUR|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1700197/lady-gaga-born-brave-bus-tour-kickoff/|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=|website=}}</ref>

=== The National Council on Behavioral Health - Mental Health First Aid ===
In August 2017, Born This Way Foundation partnered with the National Council for Behavioral Health to train 150,000 people in Mental Health First Aid. Training sessions were held along the stops for Lady Gaga's Joanne world tour, as part of BTWF's Channel Kindness Tour. Mental Health First Aid trains individuals to recognize and respond to people experiencing mental health or substance abuse crises.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2017-08-10|title=National Council for Behavioral Health and Lady Gaga’s Born This Way Foundation Team Up to Train 150,000 Mental Health First Aiders|url=https://www.mentalhealthfirstaid.org/external/2017/08/national-council-born-this-way-partnership/|access-date=2020-06-17|website=Mental Health First Aid|language=en-US}}</ref>

=== Staples ===
[[Staples Inc.|Staples]] and Born This Way Foundation teamed up to create the Staples for Students Digital Kindness Tree to encourage people nationwide to promote kindness in schools and celebrate everyday acts of kindness. Consumers helped it grow by visiting www.StaplesKindnessTree.com or by Tweeting with hashtag #GrowKindness. On the website and Twitter, users had the opportunity to describe an act of kindness that they recently performed, witnessed or pledge to do. Each time an act of kindness was reported, a “leaf” was added to the tree, which continued to grow throughout the summer with each kind act reported.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Staples and Lady Gaga’s Born This Way Foundation Promote a Positive Classroom Experience at Staples for Students Kindness Summit|url=https://news.staples.com/media-information/press-releases/press-release-details/2017/Staples-and-Lady-Gagas-Born-This-Way-Foundation-Promote-a-Positive-Classroom-Experience-at-Staples-for-Students-Kindness-Summit/default.aspx|access-date=2020-06-17|website=news.staples.com|language=en-US}}</ref>

=== Office Depot ===
In 2012, Lady Gaga expressed an interest in being part of the "natural fabric of schooling." In July 2012, BTWF partnered with the supplier of office products [[Office Depot]] to create a range of limited edition back-to-school products including: "empowerment gift cards" containing motivational messages, and "bravery bracelets." Office Depot agreed to donate 25% of the sale value for each item sold and guaranteed US$1 million donation in 2012 to the Foundation.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2012-07-17|title=Office Depot and Born This Way Foundation Connect with the Youth Market at Highly Anticipated Teen Award Show|url=https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20120717005935/en/Office-Depot-Born-Foundation-Connect-Youth-Market|access-date=2020-06-17|website=www.businesswire.com|language=en}}</ref> This led the Florida Family Association, what ''New York Times'' noted was a “one-man Christian fundamentalist organization,” to accuse Office Depot of influencing teenagers to reject heterosexuality. In support of the efforts by Office Depot and Born This Way Foundation, public service announcement videos that highlighted the mission of the initiative were created by model and actor [[Patrick Schwarzenegger]], and by pop singer [[Greyson Chance]] to be aired on Facebook, YouTube, and other outlets.<ref>{{Citation|title=Patrick Schwarzenegger joins Born This Way Foundation and Office Depot!|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzSF-jYzOwg|language=en|access-date=2020-06-17}}</ref>

==Research==
The Foundation has worked with various partners to conduct and amplify research focused on youth wellness and empowerment. Below is a list of research commissioned or supported by Born This Way Foundation.

===2019===
====Youth Mental Health in America====
In early 2019, the Foundation worked with the Benenson Strategy Group to survey more than 2,000 young people between the ages of 13–24 to explore how young people perceive mental health, their level of access to mental health resources, and what those resources look like.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Youth Mental Health in America: Understanding Resource Availability and Preferences - Born This Way Foundation|language=en-US|work=Born This Way Foundation|url=https://bornthisway.foundation/research/1-in-3-young-people-say-they-lack-reliable-access-to-mental-wellness-resources/|access-date=2020-06-17}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=2019 California Youth Mental Health Wellness Survey Results Press Release {{!}} Mental Health Services|url=https://www.mhsoac.ca.gov/2019-california-youth-mental-health-wellness-survey-results-press-release|access-date=2020-06-17|website=www.mhsoac.ca.gov}}</ref>

Key findings of the survey revealed that young people care about their mental health but lack access to crucial resources to support themselves.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Born This Way Foundation|date=2019-03-21|title=Youth Mental Health in America: Understanding Resource Availability a…|url=https://www.slideshare.net/btwfoundation/youth-mental-health-in-america-understanding-resource-availability-and-preferences-137480866?ref=https://bornthisway.foundation/research/1-in-3-young-people-say-they-lack-reliable-access-to-mental-wellness-resources/}}</ref> Young people shared they are unaware of where to go and the cost associated with finding mental health resources. The data showed that youth are interested in using a variety of resources to support their mental health. The survey showed that young people need more education on existing mental health resources and expanded access to these resources.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2019-03-12|title=Nine in 10 young people in the US are 'worried about their mental health'|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/mental-health-us-national-survey-lady-gaga-born-this-way-foundation-a8819331.html|access-date=2020-06-17|website=The Independent|language=en}}</ref>

=== 2018 ===

==== Mental Health Online Diaries: Understanding Child-Parent/Guardian Relationships ====
In early 2018, BTWF commissioned a study from the Benenson Strategy Group to conduct a series of online ethnographic diary interviews between 20 young people aged 13–24 and their parents/guardians to learn more about the family dynamics of mental health and wellness.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Mental Health Online Diaries: Understanding Child-Parent/Guardian Relationships - Born This Way Foundation|language=en-US|work=Born This Way Foundation|url=https://bornthisway.foundation/research/hard-conversations-dont-happen-when-young-people-fear-being-judged/|access-date=2020-06-17}}</ref>

The questions allowed researchers to further understand what makes for supportive environments and relationships and the ways in which young people and their parents/guardians feel connected or disconnected to their families and broader support network.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Born This Way Foundation|date=2018-08-30|title=Mental Health Online Diaries: Understanding Child-Parent/Guardian Rel…|url=https://www.slideshare.net/btwfoundation/mental-health-online-diaries-understanding-childparentguardian-relationships}}</ref> Findings from this Mental Health Online Diaries study revealed that counter to common narratives, young people see immense value in real life relationships, parents are making an effort to talk about mental health but sometimes do not connect, and hard conversations do not happen when young people fear being judged and parents do not initiate them.<ref name="themighty.com">{{Cite web|title=When I Realized I Needed to Change the Way I Talk to My Daughters About Mental Health|url=https://themighty.com/2018/08/cynthia-bissett-germanotta-lady-gaga-mental-health-parenting/|access-date=2020-06-17|website=The Mighty|language=en-US}}</ref>

==== Digital Communities: Youth Mental Health and Online Behavior ====
With data gathered during the Kind Communities survey, the Foundation explored questions related to youth mental health and their digital habits.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Digital Communities: Youth Mental Health + Online Behavior - Born This Way Foundation|language=en-US|work=Born This Way Foundation|url=https://bornthisway.foundation/research/online-communities-are-a-source-of-comfort-for-many-your-people/|access-date=2020-06-17}}</ref> In addition to examining the correlation between social media use and mental wellness, the Digital Communities: Youth Mental Health and Online Behavior survey sought to better understand how youth – including those who identify as LGBT+ – perceive their digital communities and how they use online resources to better understand and manage their mental health.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Born This Way Foundation|date=2018-01-10|title=Digital Communities: Youth Mental Health and Online Behavior|url=https://www.slideshare.net/btwfoundation/digital-communities-youth-mental-health-and-online-behavior}}</ref><ref name="nbcnews.com">{{Cite web|title=LGBTQ youth more likely to seek community online, survey shows|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/lgbtq-youth-more-likely-seek-community-online-survey-shows-n836496|access-date=2020-06-17|website=NBC News|language=en}}</ref>

=== 2017 ===

==== Kind Communities – A Bridge To Youth Mental Wellness ====
In 2017, the Foundation commissioned the “Kind Communities – A Bridge To Youth Mental Wellness” survey from the Benenson Strategy Group.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Kind Communities - A Bridge to Youth Mental Wellness - Born This Way Foundation|language=en-US|work=Born This Way Foundation|url=https://bornthisway.foundation/research/kind-communities-a-bridge-to-youth-mental-wellness/|access-date=2020-06-17}}</ref> The survey collected data from over 3,000 young people between the ages of 15-24 and over 1,000 parents, asking questions about mental health and wellness. Some of the key findings from this comprehensive study include: Young people who describe their environments as kind are more likely to be mentally healthy, youth rely on a small set of close friends for support, and young people with access to tangible resources are more mentally healthy.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Born This Way Foundation|date=2017-07-26|title=Kind Communities - A Bridge To Youth Mental Wellness|url=https://www.slideshare.net/btwfoundation/kind-communities-a-bridge-to-youth-mental-wellness}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Gibbs|first=Adrienne|title=Want To Improve The Workplace?

=== 2016 ===

==== Born Brave Experiences Research ====
The Born Brave Experiences Research is a series of studies focused on improving our understanding of the factors that influence youth empowerment, youth engagement, mental health, and emotional well-being. By working with partners across the country and surveying youth themselves, the research gained is used to learn how to better promote kindness and mental wellness in schools, communities, and homes. The surveys were conducted by Dr. Sue Swearer, the Willa Cather Professor of Educational Psychology at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. Dr. Swearer has chaired Born This Way Foundation's Research Advisory Board and led the Born Brave Experience research with assistance from Raul Palacios, Ed.S, a Doctoral Student at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Born Brave Experiences Study {{!}} College of Education and Human Sciences|url=https://cehs.unl.edu/empowerment/born-brave-experiences-study/|access-date=2020-06-17|website=cehs.unl.edu}}</ref>

==== Emotion Revolution Survey ====
In 2015, the Foundation and the Yale Center for Emotional Intelligence partnered to launch the Emotion Revolution Survey.<ref>{{Cite news|date=2015-11-04|title=The Emotion Revolution: What We Learned from the Young People|language=en-US|work=Born This Way Foundation|url=https://bornthisway.foundation/the-emotion-revolution-what-we-learned-from-the-young-people/|access-date=2020-06-17}}</ref> Collecting data from over 22,000 high school students, the survey found that when students were asked how they currently feel in school, 75% of the responses were negative. In fact, the most common responses were “tired,” “stressed,” and “bored.” However, when students were asked how they want to feel in school, the most frequently listed emotions were overwhelmingly positive, such as “happy,” “energized,” and “excited.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Yale Center for Emotional Intelligence|url=https://www.ycei.org/|access-date=2020-06-17|website=Yale Center for Emotional Intelligence|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Mansfield|first=Brian|title=Gaga, Yale team up for Emotion Revolution|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/music/2015/04/09/lady-gaga-yale-emotion-revolution/25514969/|access-date=2020-06-17|website=USA TODAY|language=en-US}}</ref>”

# In September 2012, Gaga launched a new project called A Body Revolution 2013 to address poor body image and body acceptance. This was done, in part, because media outlets had negatively remarked on supposed weight gains by the performer. To start the project, she posted images of herself in underwear on LittleMonsters.com and asked others to follow her lead stating, "May we make our flaws famous, and thus redefine the heinous." She accompanied the photos with statements that she suffered from the eating disorders bulimia and anorexia nervosa since she was 15.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Body Revolution: Is Lady Gaga's New Project Resisting Beauty Standards or Reinforcing Them?|url=https://www.bitchmedia.org/post/body-revolution-is-lady-gagas-new-project-fat-shame-feminist-magazine-music-pop-culture-body-image|access-date=2020-06-17|website=Bitch Media|language=en}}</ref>
