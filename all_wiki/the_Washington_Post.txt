[[File:Washington Post building.jpg|thumb|left|The previous headquarters of ''The Washington Post'' on 15th Street NW in [[Washington, D.C.]]]]

''The Washington Post'' is regarded as one of the leading daily American newspapers<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mondotimes.com/1/world/us/51/474/6821 |title=Washington Post – Daily Newspaper in Washington DC, USA with Local News and Events |publisher=Mondo Times |access-date= March 31, 2012}}</ref> along with ''[[The New York Times]]'', the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', and ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''. The ''Post'' has distinguished itself through its [[political journalism|political reporting]] on the workings of the [[White House]], [[Congress of the United States|Congress]], and other aspects of the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. government]].

Unlike ''The New York Times'' and ''The Wall Street Journal'', ''The Washington Post'' does not print an edition for distribution away from the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]]. In 2009, the newspaper ceased publication of its ''National Weekly Edition'', which combined stories from the week's print editions, due to shrinking circulation.<ref>{{cite news |title=Post's National Weekly Edition to Close |url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/ombudsman-blog/2009/08/posts_national_weekly_edition.html |work=The Washington Post |access-date=June 2, 2011}}</ref> The majority of its newsprint readership is in the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]] and its suburbs in [[Maryland]] and [[Northern Virginia]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.washingtonpostads.com/adsite/why/media/reach/page1450.html |work=Washington Post Media |title=The Washington Post's Circulation and Reach |access-date=March 2, 2009 |url-status = dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120080706/http://www.washingtonpostads.com/adsite/why/media/reach/page1450.html |archive-date=November 20, 2008}}</ref>

The newspaper is one of a few U.S. newspapers with [[News bureau|foreign bureaus]], located in [[Beirut]], [[Berlin]], [[Beijing]], [[Bogotá]], [[Cairo]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Islamabad]], [[Jerusalem]], [[Kabul]], [[London]], [[Mexico City]], [[Moscow]], [[Nairobi]], [[New Delhi]], [[Paris]], and [[Tokyo]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/world/foreignbureaus/index.html |title=Washington Post Foreign Bureaus |work=The Washington Post |access-date=July 20, 2015}}</ref> In November 2009, it announced the closure of its U.S. regional bureaus—Chicago, Los Angeles and New York—as part of an increased focus on "political stories and local news coverage in Washington."<ref>{{cite news |title=Washington Post to close three regional bureaux |work=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8377802.stm |date=November 25, 2009 |access-date=November 25, 2009}}</ref> The newspaper has local bureaus in Maryland ([[Annapolis, Maryland|Annapolis]], [[Montgomery County, Maryland|Montgomery County]], [[Prince George's County, Maryland|Prince George's County]], and [[Southern Maryland]]) and Virginia ([[Alexandria, Virginia|Alexandria]], [[Fairfax, Virginia|Fairfax]], [[Loudoun County, Virginia|Loudoun County]], [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]], and [[Prince William County, Virginia|Prince William County]]).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.washpost.com/news_ed/news/bureaus.shtml |title=Washington Post Bureaus |work=The Washington Post |access-date=November 25, 2009 |url-status = dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090203155750/http://washpost.com/news_ed/news/bureaus.shtml |archive-date=February 3, 2009}}</ref>

{{As of|2013|05}}, its average weekday circulation was 474,767, according to the [[Audit Bureau of Circulations (North America)|Audit Bureau of Circulations]], making it the [[List of newspapers in the United States by circulation|seventh largest newspaper in the country by circulation]], behind ''[[USA Today]]'', ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', ''The New York Times'', the ''Los Angeles Times'', the ''[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]'', and the ''[[New York Post]]''. Although its circulation (like almost all newspapers) has been slipping, it has one of the highest [[market penetration]] rates of any metropolitan news daily.

For many decades, the ''Post'' had its main office at 1150 15th Street NW. This real estate remained with Graham Holdings when the newspaper was sold to Jeff Bezos' Nash Holdings in 2013. Graham Holdings sold 1150 15th Street (along with 1515 L Street, 1523 L Street, and land beneath 1100 15th Street) for {{US$|159{{nbsp}}million}}in November 2013.

===Founding and early period===
[[File:Sign, "Welcome Home From the Crow-Eaters," on the front of the Washington Post Building in Washington, DC. President... - NARA - 199955.jpg|thumb|''The Washington Post'' building in 1948]]

The newspaper was founded in 1877 by [[Stilson Hutchins]] (1838{{ndash}}1912), and in 1880 it added a Sunday edition, becoming the city's first newspaper to publish seven days a week.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/polls/washpost/gi_hi.htm | title = Washington Post website, General Information, History, Early History (1877–1933)}}</ref>

[[File:Washington Post and Union masthead 18780416.jpg|thumb|The ''Washington Post and Union'' masthead, April 16, 1878 |left]]In April 1878, about four months into publication, ''The Washington Post'' purchased ''The Washington Union'', a competing newspaper which was founded by John Lynch in late 1877. The ''Union'' had only been in operation about six months at the time of the acquisition. The combined newspaper was published from the Globe Building as ''The Washington Post and Union'' beginning on April 15, 1878, with a circulation of 13,000.<ref>{{cite news |title='The Post' as an Absorbent |issue=April 16, 1878 |publisher=The Washington Post and Union |date=April 16, 1878 |page=2}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Masthead |publisher=The Washington Post and Union |date=April 15, 1878 |page=1}}</ref> The ''Post and Union'' name was used about two weeks until April 29, 1878, returning to the original masthead the following day.<ref>{{cite news |title=Masthead |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=April 30, 1878 |page=1}}</ref>

In 1889, Hutchins sold the newspaper to [[Frank Hatton (U.S. politician)|Frank Hatton]], a former Postmaster General, and [[Beriah Wilkins]], a former Democratic congressman from Ohio. To promote the newspaper, the new owners requested the leader of the [[United States Marine Band]], [[John Philip Sousa]], to compose a [[March (music)|march]] for the newspaper's essay contest awards ceremony. Sousa composed "[[The Washington Post (march)|The Washington Post]]".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.washpost.com/gen_info/history/timeline/1889.shtml |title=1889 |website=The Washington Post |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060312152421/http://www.washpost.com/gen_info/history/timeline/1889.shtml |archive-date=March 12, 2006 }}</ref> It became the standard music to accompany the [[Two-step (dance move)|two-step]], a late 19th-century [[dance craze]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://lrs.ed.uiuc.edu/students/r-rosas/souscoll.htm |title=John Philip Sousa Collection |website=University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090531000910/http://lrs.ed.uiuc.edu/students/r-rosas/souscoll.htm |archive-date=May 31, 2009 }}</ref> and remains one of Sousa's best-known works.

In 1893, the newspaper moved to a building at 14th and E streets NW, where it would remain until 1950. This building combined all functions of the newspaper into one headquarters – newsroom, advertising, typesetting, and printing – that ran 24 hours per day.<ref name=Goodbye>{{cite news | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/magazine/goodbye-old-washington-post-home-of-the-newspaper-the-grahams-built/2015/12/07/023a0382-5d54-11e5-9757-e49273f05f65_story.html | title = Goodbye, old Washington Post, home of the newspaper the Grahams built | first = Marc | last = Fisher | date = December 10, 2015 | work = The Washington Post | access-date = March 24, 2017}}</ref>

In 1898, during the [[Spanish–American War]], the ''Post'' printed [[Clifford K. Berryman]]'s classic illustration ''[[Remember the Maine]]'', which became the battle-cry for American sailors during the War. In 1902, Berryman published another famous cartoon in the ''Post'' – ''Drawing the Line in Mississippi''. This cartoon depicts President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] showing compassion for a small bear cub and inspired New York store owner [[Morris Michtom]] to create the [[teddy bear]].<ref>{{cite web|title = Clifford K. Berryman Political Cartoon Collection|url = https://www.archives.gov/legislative/research/special-collections/berryman/|website = www.archives.gov|access-date = August 12, 2015}}</ref>

Wilkins acquired Hatton's share of the newspaper in 1894 at Hatton's death. After Wilkins' death in 1903, his sons John and Robert ran the ''Post'' for two years before selling it in 1905 to [[John Roll McLean]], owner of the ''[[Cincinnati Enquirer]]''. During the [[Woodrow Wilson|Wilson]] presidency, the ''Post'' was credited with the "most famous newspaper [[typo]]" in D.C. history according to ''[[Reason (magazine)|Reason]]'' magazine; the ''Post'' intended to report that President Wilson had been "entertaining" his future-wife Mrs. Galt, but instead wrote that he had been "entering" Mrs. Galt.<ref>{{cite news|last=Rabbe|first=Will|title=The Washington Post's Famous 1915 Typo|url=http://tv.msnbc.com/2013/08/06/washington-post-famous-wilson-typo/|newspaper=MSNBC|date=June 8, 2013}}</ref><ref name=tws5nov01>{{cite journal|author=Freund, Charles Paul|title=D.C.

When John McLean died in 1916, he put the newspaper in trust, having little faith that his playboy son [[Edward Beale McLean|Edward "Ned" McLean]] could manage his inheritance. Ned went to court and broke the trust, but, under his management, the newspaper slumped toward ruin. He bled the paper for his lavish lifestyle, and used it to promote political agendas.<ref>{{cite book|author=Carol Felsenthal|title=Power, Privilege and the Post: The Katharine Graham Story|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=x0lNDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT57

During the [[Red Summer of 1919]] the Post supported the white mobs and even ran a front-page story which advertised the location at which white servicemen were planning to meet to carry out attacks on black Washingtonians.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Higgins |first1=Abigail |title=Red Summer of 1919: How Black WWI Vets Fought Back Against Racist Mobs |url=https://www.history.com/news/red-summer-1919-riots-chicago-dc-great-migration |website=www.history.com |publisher=History |access-date=December 23, 2019}}</ref>

The ''Post''{{'s}} health and reputation were restored under Meyer's ownership.

After Phil Graham's death in 1963, control of The Washington Post Company passed to his wife [[Katharine Graham]] (1917{{ndash}}2001), who was also Eugene Meyer's daughter. Few women had run prominent national newspapers in the United States. Katharine Graham described her own anxiety and lack of confidence as she stepped into a leadership role in her autobiography.

National security correspondent [[Walter Pincus]] reported that he had been ordered to cease his reports that were critical of the administration.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/moyers/journal/btw/transcript1.html|title=Transcript: "Buying the War"|date=April 25, 2007|work=PBS|access-date=December 13, 2009}}</ref> According to author and journalist [[Greg Mitchell]]: "By the ''Post''{{'s}} own admission, in the months before the war, it ran more than 140 stories on its front page promoting the war, while contrary information got lost".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thenation.com/article/eleven-years-how-washington-post-helped-give-us-iraq-war/ |title=Eleven Years On: How 'The Washington Post' Helped Give Us the Iraq War |date=March 12, 2014|work= [[The Nation]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170304190318/https://www.thenation.com/article/eleven-years-how-washington-post-helped-give-us-iraq-war/ |archive-date=March 4, 2017 |url-status = dead}}</ref>

On March 26, 2007, [[Chris Matthews]] said on his television program, "Well, ''The Washington Post'' is not the liberal newspaper it was, Congressman, let me tell you. I have been reading it for years and it is a [[neoconservatism|neocon]] newspaper".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/17798805|title=Hardball with Chris Matthews for March 23|date=March 26, 2007|publisher=[[NBC News]]|access-date=April 4, 2009}}</ref> It has regularly published a mixture of op-ed columnists, with some of them left-leaning (including [[E.&nbsp;J. Dionne]], [[Dana Milbank]], Greg Sargent, and [[Eugene Robinson (journalist)|Eugene Robinson]]), and some of them right-leaning (including [[George Will]], [[Marc Thiessen]], [[Michael Gerson]] and [[Charles Krauthammer]]).

In a study published on April 18, 2007, by Yale professors Alan Gerber, Dean Karlan, and Daniel Bergan, citizens were given a subscription to either the conservative-leaning ''Washington Times'' or the liberal-leaning ''Washington Post'' to see the effect that media has on voting patterns. Gerber had estimated based on his work that the ''Post'' slanted as much to the left as the ''Times'' did to the right. Gerber found those who were given a free subscription of the ''Post'' were 7.9–11.4% more likely to vote for the Democratic candidate for governor than those assigned to the control group, depending on the adjustment for the date on which individual participants were surveyed and the survey interviewer; however, people who received the ''Times'' were also more likely than controls to vote for the Democrat, with an effect approximately 60% as large as that estimated for the ''Post''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/nov/8/republicans-media-bias-claims-boosted-by-scarcity-/|title=Republicans' media bias claims boosted by the scarcity of right-leaning journalists|newspaper=The Washington Times|access-date=February 13, 2016}}</ref><ref name=Gerber>{{cite web|url=http://www.econ.yale.edu/karlan/papers/newspapers.pdf|title=Does The Media Matter?

It appears that heightened exposure to both papers’ news coverage, despite opposing ideological slants, moved public opinion away from Republicans."<ref name=Gerber />

In November 2007, the newspaper was criticized by independent journalist [[Robert Parry (journalist)|Robert Parry]] for reporting on anti-Obama chain e-mails without sufficiently emphasizing to its readers the false nature of the anonymous claims.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.consortiumnews.com/2007/112907.html|title=WPost Buys into Anti-Obama Bigotry|author-link=Robert Parry (journalist)|date=November 29, 2007|author=Robert Parry|work=Consortium News|access-date=April 4, 2009}}</ref> In 2009, Parry criticized the newspaper for its allegedly unfair reporting on liberal politicians, including Vice President [[Al Gore]] and President [[Barack Obama]].<ref>Robert Parry (March 19, 2009), [http://www.consortiumnews.com/2009/031909.html "Framing Obama&nbsp;– by the WPost"], ''Consortium News''</ref>

Responding to criticism of the newspaper's coverage during the run-up to the [[2008 United States presidential election|2008 presidential election]], former ''Post'' [[ombudsman]] [[Deborah Howell]] wrote: "The opinion pages have strong conservative voices; the editorial board includes centrists and conservatives; and there were editorials critical of Obama.

In mid-September 2016, Matthew Ingram of ''[[Forbes]]'' joined [[Glenn Greenwald]] of ''[[The Intercept]]'', and Trevor Trimm of ''[[The Guardian]]'' in criticizing ''The Washington Post'' for "demanding that [former National Security Agency contractor Edward] Snowden&nbsp;... stand trial on espionage charges".<ref>{{cite web|author=Glenn Greenwald|date=September 18, 2016|website=The Intercept|url=https://theintercept.com/2016/09/18/washpost-makes-history-first-paper-to-call-for-prosecution-of-its-own-source-after-accepting-pulitzer|title=WashPost Makes History: First Paper to Call for Prosecution of Its Own Source (After Accepting Pulitzer)}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Ingram|first1=Matthew|title=Here's Why The Washington Post Is Wrong About Edward Snowden|url=http://fortune.com/2016/09/19/washington-post-snowden/}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Disis|first1=Jill|url=https://money.cnn.com/2016/09/18/media/washington-post-criticism-snowden-pardon/|title=Washington Post criticized for opposing Snowden pardon}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Trimm|first1=Trevor|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/19/washington-post-wrong-edward-snowden-pardon|title=The Washington Post is wrong: Edward Snowden should be pardoned}}</ref>

In February 2017, the ''Post'' adopted the slogan "[[Democracy Dies in Darkness]]" for its masthead.<ref name="OldSaying">{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/the-washington-posts-new-slogan-turns-out-to-be-an-old-saying/2017/02/23/cb199cda-fa02-11e6-be05-1a3817ac21a5_story.html|title=The Washington Post's new slogan turns out to be an old saying|last=Farhi|first=Paul|date=February 23, 2017|work=The Washington Post}}</ref>

Since 2011, the ''Post'' has been running a column called "The Fact Checker" that the ''Post'' describes as a "truth squad."<ref name="About the Fact Checker">Glenn Kessler (January 1, 2017), [https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/01/07/about-fact-checker/ "About the Fact Checker"], ''The Washington Post''</ref> The Fact Checker received a $250,000 grant from [[Google News Initiative]]/[[YouTube]] to expand production of video [[fact-checking|fact checks]].<ref name="About the Fact Checker"/>

====Political endorsements====
Katharine Graham wrote in her autobiography ''[[Personal History]]'' that the newspaper long had a policy of not making endorsements for political candidates. However, since at least 2000, the newspaper has occasionally endorsed Republican politicians, such as [[Governor of Maryland|Maryland Governor]] [[Robert Ehrlich]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/10/25/AR2006102501668.html |title=Wrong Choice for Governor |work=The Washington Post |date=October 26, 2006 |access-date=April 4, 2009}}</ref> In 2006, it repeated its historic endorsements of every Republican incumbent for Congress in [[Northern Virginia]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/10/29/AR2006102900552.html |title=For Congress in Virginia |work=The Washington Post |date=October 30, 2006 |access-date=April 4, 2009}}</ref> There have also been times when the ''Post'' has specifically chosen not to endorse any candidate, such as in the [[1988 United States presidential election|1988 presidential election]] when it refused to endorse then-Governor [[Michael Dukakis]] or then-Vice President [[George H.W.

The ''Post'' endorsed Maryland Governor [[Harry Hughes]] and D.C. Mayor [[Marion Barry]] in the 1978 elections.

== Criticism and controversies ==
==="Jimmy's World" fabrication===
In September 1980, a Sunday feature story appeared on the front page of the ''Post'' titled "Jimmy's World" in which reporter [[Janet Cooke]] wrote a profile of the life of an eight-year-old [[heroin]] [[Substance dependence|addict]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1980/09/28/jimmys-world/605f237a-7330-4a69-8433-b6da4c519120/|title=Jimmy's World|author=Janet Cooke|date=September 28, 1980 |website=The Washington Post|page=A1|access-date=July 9, 2016|author-link=Janet Cooke}}</ref> Although some within the ''Post'' doubted the story's veracity, the paper's editors defended it, and assistant managing editor [[Bob Woodward]] submitted the story to the [[Pulitzer Prize#Board|Pulitzer Prize Board]] at [[Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism|Columbia University]] for consideration. Cooke was awarded the [[Pulitzer Prize for Feature Writing]] on April 13, 1981.

=== Private "salon" solicitation ===
In July 2009, in the midst of an intense debate over [[Health care reforms proposed during the Obama administration|health care reform]], ''[[The Politico]]'' reported that a health-care [[lobbyist]] had received an "astonishing" offer of access to the ''Post's'' "health-care reporting and editorial staff."<ref>Michael Calderone and Mike Allen (July 2, 2009), [https://www.politico.com/story/2009/07/wapo-cancels-lobbyist-event-024441?

Almost immediately following the disclosure, Weymouth canceled the salons, saying, "This should never have happened." White House counsel [[Gregory B. Craig]] reminded officials that under [[Honest Leadership and Open Government Act|federal ethics rules]], they need advance approval for such events. ''Post'' Executive Editor [[Marcus Brauchli]], who was named on the flier as one of the salon's "Hosts and Discussion Leaders," said he was "appalled" by the plan, adding, "It suggests that access to ''Washington Post'' journalists was available for purchase."<ref name=KurtzPost>Howard Kurtz (July 3, 2009), [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/07/02/AR2009070201563.html?hpid=topnews "Washington Post Publisher Cancels Planned Policy Dinners After Outcry"], ''The Washington Post''</ref>

===''China Daily'' advertising supplements===
Dating back to 2011, ''The Washington Post'' began to include "China Watch" advertising supplements provided by ''[[China Daily]]'', an English language newspaper owned by the [[Publicity Department of the Communist Party of China]], on the print and online editions. Although the header to the online "China Watch" section included the text "A Paid Supplement to The Washington Post," [[James Fallows]] of ''[[The Atlantic]]'' suggested that the notice was not clear enough for most readers to see.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2011/02/official-chinese-propaganda-now-online-from-the-wapo/70690/|title=Official Chinese Propaganda: Now Online from the WaPo!|last=Fallows|first=James|work=The Atlantic|date=February 3, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110207020433/https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2011/02/official-chinese-propaganda-now-online-from-the-wapo/70690/|archive-date=February 7, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref> Distributed to the ''Post'' and multiple newspapers around the world, the "China Watch" advertising supplements range from four to eight pages and appear at least monthly. According to a 2018 report by ''[[The Guardian]]'', "China Watch" uses "a didactic, old-school approach to propaganda."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/dec/07/china-plan-for-global-media-dominance-propaganda-xi-jinping|title= Inside China's audacious global propaganda campaign|last1=Lim|first1=Louisa|last2=Bergin|first2=Julia|work=The Guardian|date=December 7, 2018|access-date=March 21, 2020}}</ref>

In June 2018, over 400 employees of ''The Washington Post'' signed an open letter to the owner [[Jeff Bezos]] demanding "fair wages; fair benefits for retirement, family leave and health care; and a fair amount of job security." The open letter was accompanied by video testimonials from employees, who alleged "shocking pay practices" despite record growth in subscriptions at the newspaper, with salaries only rising an average of $10 per week, less than half the rate of inflation. The petition followed on a year of unsuccessful negotiations between ''The Washington Post'' [[Guild]] and upper management over pay and benefit increases.<ref>{{cite web| author=Isobel Asher Hamilton|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/washington-post-staff-sent-fair-pay-petition-to-jeff-bezos-2018-6| title=More than 400 Washington Post staffers wrote an open letter to Jeff Bezos calling out his 'shocking' pay practices| website=Business Insider| date=June 15, 2018| access-date=June 18, 2018}}</ref>
