The '''Sara Lee Corporation''' was an American consumer-goods company based in [[Downers Grove, Illinois]].<ref>"[http://www.saralee.com/InvestorRelations/InvestorContacts.aspx Investor Contacts]." Sara Lee Corporation. Retrieved on January 31, 2011. "Sara Lee Corporation Investor Relations Department 3500 Lacey Road Downers Grove, Illinois 60515-5424 ."</ref><ref>"[http://www.saralee.com/AboutSaraLee.aspx About Sara Lee]." Sara Lee Corporation. Retrieved on January 31, 2011. "Based in Downers Grove, Ill.,[...]"</ref> It had operations in more than 40 countries and sold its products in over 180 countries. Its international operations were headquartered in [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]], The [[Netherlands]]. While no longer operated independently, as of 2020, Sara Lee still actively exists as a current brand name under the auspices of holding company Kohlberg, making frozen cakes, etc. at its present facility in Illinois, United States.

Sara Lee is also the brand name of a number of frozen and packaged foods, often known for the long-running slogan "Everybody doesn't like something, but nobody doesn't like Sara Lee," often incorrectly reported as "Nobody does it like Sara Lee."

While the company traced its lineage to 1939, when [[Nathan Cummings]] acquired C. D. Kenny Company, a wholesale distributor of sugar, coffee, and tea in Baltimore, the Sara Lee Corporation was actually the descendant of a Chicago grocery store called Sprague, Warner & Company. This enterprise, which started on State Street in Chicago, was founded during the Civil War by Albert A. Sprague and Ezra J. Warner. By 1909, Sprague, Warner & Company was one of the leading wholesale grocery companies in the United States, famous for house brands such as Richelieu, Ferndell, and Batavia. In 1942, this company was acquired by the Canadian-born Cummings. The new Chicago-based company, at first called Sprague Warner–Kenny Corp., ranked as the largest grocery wholesaler in the United States. Annual sales grew from about $20 million in 1942 to $120 million by 1946. After changing its name in 1945 to Consolidated Grocers, Cummings's company became the Consolidated Foods Corporation in 1953.<ref>"[http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/2623.html Consolidated Foods Corp]." Electronic Encyclopedia of Chicago. Retrieved on May 1, 2014.</ref>

In 1956, the company bought a company known as [[Kitchens of Sara Lee]], which became one of the company's best-known brand names. Management adopted the brand name as the name of the corporation as a whole in 1985. As of 2005, Sara Lee Corporation had operations in more than 40 countries; sold food, beverage, and household products in over 180 countries; and had some 137,000 employees worldwide.<ref name="annual">{{cite web|url=http://www.saralee.com/InvestorRelations/FinancialInformation/~/media/F87CF6CF8B5C4F78B514F902CD60DF47.ashx|title=Sara Lee 2005 Annual Report|publisher=Sara Lee Corporation|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070709060557/http://www.saralee.com/InvestorRelations/FinancialInformation/~/media/F87CF6CF8B5C4F78B514F902CD60DF47.ashx|archivedate=July 9, 2007}}</ref>

On July 4, 2012, Sara Lee Corporation was split into two companies—one for North American operations which would be renamed [[Hillshire Brands]] (the Sara Lee name would continue to be used on bakery and certain deli products distributed by Hillshire Brands), the other for international beverage and bakery businesses named [[Jacobs Douwe Egberts|D.E Master Blenders 1753]].<ref name=Split/>

==History==
Prior to 1985, The Sara Lee Corporation was called Consolidated Foods, of which Sara Lee was the best known brand. Consolidated Foods had bought a Chicago bakery chain called [[Kitchens of Sara Lee]] in 1956 from Charles Lubin. Lubin had named his bakeries after his daughter, Sara Lee. She was born in 1941, and now goes by her married name, [[Sara Lee Schupf]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/07/17/obituaries/charles-w-lubin-84-sara-lee-s-founder.html|title=Charles W. Lubin, 84, Sara Lee's Founder|agency=Associated Press|date=17 July 1988|work=New York Times|accessdate=2012-01-30}}</ref> Despite being named after a real person, the actual image of Sara never appeared on the packaging; only the name.

In 1986, Sara Lee bought the manufacturing and mail order operations of Wolferman's, a maker of [[English muffin]]s, that dated back to 1888.<ref>{{cite news| url= http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=CSTB&p_theme=cstb&p_action=search&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EB36D142D5CE318&p_field_direct-0=document_id| title= Muffin-maker Wolferman sells two units to Sara Lee | author= Helene McEntee | date= 17 July 1986 | publisher= [[Chicago Sun-Times]] |accessdate=2010-12-16}}</ref>

In February 1988, Sara Lee agreed to the purchase of the 84-year-old Adams-Millis Corporation of [[High Point, North Carolina]], the largest private label sock and stocking manufacturer in the United States, with 3000 employees and 1987 sales of nearly $200 million.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.greensboro.com/life/this-day-in-history/article_58bf5259-36a1-5cac-ab24-0a168bc95361.html|title=This day in history|work=[[News and Record]]|date=2016-02-09|accessdate=2016-11-08}}</ref>

On June 25, 2001, Sara Lee Corp pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor and agreed to pay $4.4 million for selling tainted meat that was blamed for at least 15 deaths and six miscarriages in 1998; the agreement stressed that Sara Lee's Bil Mar Foods division did not knowingly distribute the tainted meat.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/06/23/us/sara-lee-corp-pleads-guilty-in-meat-case.html |title= Sara Lee Corp.

Brenda C. Barnes joined Sara Lee Corporation in July 2004 as the President and Chief Operating Officer. Then in February 2005, Barnes was named President and Chief Executive Officer, and the corporation announced it would move its headquarters from [[Cincinnati]], Ohio, to [[Downers Grove, Illinois]], which housed the company's North American operating businesses and the majority of Sara Lee's corporate staff.

Also in February 2005, the company began executing a multi-year plan to transform Sara Lee into a company focused on its food, beverage, and household and body care businesses around the world. To support that focus, Sara Lee announced plans to dispose of approximately 40 percent of the company's revenues, including its apparel, European packaged meats, US retail coffee and direct selling businesses. On December 22, 2005, Sara Lee Corporation was to delist from Euronext Amsterdam and Euronext Paris stock exchanges, as well as the Swiss Exchange. The company said it was taking the voluntary step due to low trading volumes on those exchanges.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://origin-www.lexisnexis.com/ap/auth/ |title= US: Sara Lee to delist on three stock markets just-food global news December 22, 2005 Thursday 2:07 PM GMT }}</ref>

2005 also saw the debut of Sara Lee Soft & Smooth made with whole grain white bread. In October, Barnes succeeded C. Steven McMillan as chairman. The year ended with the sale of the direct selling business to [[Tupperware]].

In 2006, Sara Lee announced a new company wide campaign: "the joy of eating." The campaign was part of a restructuring at Sara Lee.

2006 featured the divestiture of Sara Lee's European meats and European branded apparel businesses. In addition, the corporation spun off to its shareholders the branded apparel, Americas/Asia, business, into a separate, publicly traded company called [[Hanesbrands]] Inc.

Including the spin-off, Sara Lee raised more than $3.7 billion in proceeds as part of the company's transformation plan. In addition to the monetary benefits, the company became tightly focused on its core businesses—food, beverage, and household and body care. In 2008, Sara Lee sold off its [[Direct Store Delivery]] foodservice coffee business to [[Farmer Brothers]] for a reported $45 million.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=axWm4mYOd9gw |title=Farmer Bros. to Acquire Sara Lee's Direct-Store Delivery Coffee  |publisher=Bloomberg  |date=2008-12-03 |accessdate=2014-09-17}}</ref>

By 2009, Sara Lee was pursuing the sale of its household and body care business in their continuing effort to focus on core business.<ref>{{cite news|last=Dorfman|first=Brad|title=Sara Lee still evaluating possible unit sale|publisher=Reuters|date=17 April 2009|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/innovationNews/idUSTRE53G41F20090417|accessdate=3 May 2009}}</ref> In April, Sara Lee launched a state-of-the-art research and development center named The Kitchens of Sara Lee, a {{convert|120000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} campus at the company's headquarters in Downers Grove, Ill.<ref>{{cite press release|title=Sara Lee Corporation Opens the Kitchens of Sara Lee|publisher=Sara Lee Corporation|date=17 April 2009|url=http://www.saralee.com/~/media/1CDA059186314B949BA91A752E8B423D.ashx|accessdate=3 May 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090420033519/http://www.saralee.com/~/media/1CDA059186314B949BA91A752E8B423D.ashx|archivedate=April 20, 2009}}</ref>

On November 9, 2010, Sara Lee said that by selling its North American Fresh Bakery unit to [[Grupo Bimbo]], it could grow in other areas. The $959 million deal gave Sara Lee the right to continue using the Sara Lee name on frozen desserts and meat products. Grupo Bimbo was to use the Sara Lee name for fresh-baked products around the world except for [[Western Europe]], [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]]. The deal also gave Grupo Bimbo 41 baking plants, and the regional brands Grandma Sycamore's, Heiner's and Rainbo.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.news-record.com/content/2010/11/09/article/sara_lee_to_sell_north_american_bakery_unit_for_959_million|title=Sara Lee to sell North American bakery unit for $959 million|work=[[News & Record]]|agency=[[Associated Press]]|date=2010-11-09|accessdate=2010-11-09}}</ref>

On January 28, 2011, Sara Lee announced the company would be split into two units. The company said its North American operations (including Jimmy Dean, Ball Park and Hillshire Farm) would take the Hillshire Brands corporate name, while the international beverage and bakery businesses (including Douwe Egberts, Senseo, Pickwick, Maison du Café, L'OR, Café Pilão, and Marcilla) would constitute a separate unit named D.E Master Blenders 1753. Some analysts claimed splitting the business into two units would make a takeover more likely. Stockholders would have equal shares in both companies. In the same month, Sara Lee received noted media attention regarding their strategy to "refocus on the core" to revamp the company. In a [[Forbes magazine]] column, Adam Hartung stated Sara Lee could not "cost-cut, refocus or re-align a business to success with no new products and no growth plan."<ref>{{cite web|last=Hartung|first=Adam|title=Killing Me Softly- Leadership Failure at Sara Lee|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/adamhartung/2011/01/25/killing-me-softly-sara-lee/|publisher=Forbes Magazine|accessdate=28 June 2012}}</ref> Also, Marcel Smits, interim CEO since Barnes suffered a [[stroke]], became the new CEO, and Jan Bennink director and chairman.<ref name=Split>{{cite news|url=http://www.news-record.com/content/2011/01/28/article/sara_lee_to_split_into_2_businesses|title=Sara Lee to split into two businesses|work=[[News & Record]]|agency=[[Associated Press]]|date=2011-01-28|accessdate=2011-01-28}}</ref> The split was completed on July 4, 2012.
