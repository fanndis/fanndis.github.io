'''Women for Women International''' ('''WfWI''') is a nonprofit humanitarian organization that provides practical and moral support to female survivors of war. WfWI helps such women rebuild their lives after war's devastation through a year-long tiered program that begins with direct financial aid and emotional counseling and includes life skills (e.g., literacy, numeracy) training if necessary, rights awareness education, health education, job skills training and small business development.

==History==
In 1993, Women for Women International was co-founded by a husband and wife, Amjad Atallah and [[Zainab Salbi]], an [[Iraqi American]] who is herself a survivor of the [[Iran–Iraq War]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://newint.org/features/web-exclusive/2011/03/02/my-uncle-the-tyrant|title=My uncle, the tyrant|date=2011-03-02|website=New Internationalist|language=en|access-date=2020-02-24}}</ref>

They were motivated to act after learning of the plight of women in rape camps during the [[Yugoslav Wars]] and the slow response of the international community.<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|last=Khaleeli|first=Homa|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/apr/02/zainab-salbi-women-for-women-international|title=Zainab Salbi: Escape from tyranny|date=2013-04-02|work=The Guardian|access-date=2020-02-24|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> WfWI launched its activities by creating "sister-to-sister" connections between sponsors in the United States and women survivors of [[Bosnian War|war in Bosnia and Herzegovina]].

In its first year, Women for Women International worked with eight women, distributing about $9,000 in direct aid.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://women-s.net/women-for-women-organization/|title=Women for Women Is an Awesome Organization Focused on Empowering Women Worldwide|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> As the organization gained experience, its staff came to understand that financial assistance alone was not a sufficient response for women who had lost everything. Women survivors of war, especially those left widowed, also needed to cultivate an understanding of their rights and potential as women, develop marketable skills, and find a way to generate stable income.<ref>"Charity of the Month - Woman Power" The Family Groove, 20 May 2006.</ref>

From 2012 to 2014, WfWI was led by Afshan Khan, a long-time former executive with UNICEF who became WfWI's first new CEO since founder Zainab Salbi stepped down to devote more time to her writing and lecturing.<ref>"Women for Women International Names Afshan Khan New CEO."

As of 2015, the charity has helped about 449,000 marginalized women in countries affected by war.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|title=Zainab Salbi: The Voice Of Arabia|url=https://www.harpersbazaararabia.com/people/culture/voice-of-arabia-zainab-salbi|website=Harper's BAZAAR Arabia|language=en|access-date=2020-02-24}}</ref>

==How it works==
Women for Women International connects women with other women a conflict zone and the sponsor sends money every month to this ''sister''. The participants enroll in a one-year program designed to help them gain the skills, confidence, psychological healing, and mutual support needed to rebuild their lives after war. After the program they become leaders in their communities:<ref name=":0" /> Participant women are placed in groups (usually around 25) which become their permanent support network. Each group goes through an educational program to learn about their rights and role in the economic, social, and civic life of their communities. They learn about health and wellness practices. Those who need it receive basic literacy or numeracy training to help them prepare for the second tier of the program.

Next, each woman receives vocational and business training consistent with clear goals she herself has laid out in her Individual Participant Plan. This phase of training is designed to strengthen existing skills and introduce new ones in both traditional and nontraditional fields. Vocational skills engage women in agriculture, livestock, food processing, various jobs in the service industry, textile and handcrafts, and other livelihoods.

As of June 30, 2011, WfWI had disbursed $103 million to some 317,000 women participants. The program is paid for through a mix of individual "sister to sister" direct sponsorships and grants from governmental, multilateral, foundation, corporate, and individual donors.<ref>"Women for Women International Supports Women of South Sudan on Country's First Anniversary" Yahoo News, 9 July 2012.</ref>

==Other activities==
Along with its direct service to women program participants, Women for Women International uses its voice to educate the public about war's effects on women, particularly around the use of mass rape as a weapon of war. WfWI also seeks to raise awareness about the unique role that women play in advancing peace throughout society. WfWI leadership have testified before the US Congress and executive branch about women's issues and their intersection with foreign policy. WfWI executives also regularly speak at international conferences, panels and in the media. High-profile special events (e.g., the "Join Me on the Bridge" rallies held each year on [[International Women's Day]]), print and broadcast coverage, and books (Zainab Salbi's The Other Side of War) are all tactics in WfWI's strategy of building global understanding about women's indispensable role in civil society.

Since 2016, WfWI has held an annual charity sale to raise money for women survivors of war. The 2017 sale raised over US$224,000.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://wwd.com/fashion-news/fashion-scoops/women-for-women-international-host-sheinspiresme-charity-sale-1202633476/|title=Women for Women International to Host #SheInspiresMe Charity Sale|last=Marfil|first=Lorelei|date=2018-03-20|work=WWD|access-date=2018-03-23|language=en-US}}</ref>

==Awards==
In September 2006, Women for Women International was the first women's organization to receive the Conrad Hilton Humanitarian Award, the world's largest humanitarian prize of $1.5 million. The [[Conrad N. Hilton Foundation]] presents the annual award to an organization that "significantly alleviates human suffering."<ref name="WRMEA">Hanley, Delinda C. "[http://www.wrmea.com/component/content/article/288-2006-december/6433-human-rights-women-for-women-wins-hilton-humanitarian-prize.html Women for Women Wins Hilton Humanitarian Prize]". ''[[Washington Report on Middle East Affairs]]'', December 2006. Retrieved 2016-10-02.</ref> "Women and children bear the major burdens of the unprecedented number of wars and civil conflicts raging worldwide and are often left to rebuild their lives without the basic necessities for survival or a viable means to earn a living and take care of their families," said Steven M. Hilton, chairman and CEO of the Hilton Foundation. "Women for Women International has demonstrated that it can create change and stability within a society by providing women survivors with the tools and resources to rebuild their lives. The organization also gives women the training and confidence to engage in their communities', and ultimately their nation's economic, political and social structures," he added.<ref name="WRMEA" />

When Salbi, WfWI founder, accepted the award she said: "It reinforces our vision that stronger women build stronger nations, and encourages us to work harder to bring the voices and concerns of the women we serve to the forefront.<ref name="WRMEA" /> [[Amartya Sen]], [[List of Nobel laureates|Nobel Laureate]] and Hilton Prize juror also commented on the selection saying women of war is a neglected issue and WfWI has identified the need and has gone on to protect millions of lives.<ref name="WRMEA" />
