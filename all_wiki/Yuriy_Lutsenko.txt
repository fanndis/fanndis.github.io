Lutsenko's wife Iryna Lutsenko was member of the [[Ukrainian parliament]] from 2015 until 2019.<ref name=luwbip/><ref name="7230854IrynaL"/>

==Early life==
Lutsenko was born in [[Rivne]]. His father was Vitaliy Ivanovych Lutsenko (15 March 1937 – 4 June 1999), who was elected people's deputy of Ukraine in [[1994 Ukrainian parliamentary election|1994]] and [[1998 Ukrainian parliamentary election|1998]], and secretary of the Central Committee of [[Communist Party of Ukraine]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://src-h.slav.hokudai.ac.jp/ukrregions/data/99.html|title=Lutsenko Vitaliy Ivanovich biography|publisher=[[Hokkaido University]]|language=Russian}}</ref> Lutsenko's mother is Vira Mikhailivna (born 1936), a [[Veterinary medicine|veterinarian]].

Lutsenko earned his degree in engineering in 1989 from [[Lviv Polytechnic|Lviv Polytechnical Institute]].

==Political career==
Lutsenko gained public fame as one of the leaders of the [[Ukraine without Kuchma!]] campaign, which followed the [[Cassette Scandal]] of 2000.<ref>[http://edition.cnn.com/2001/WORLD/europe/03/05/ukraine.tent/index.html?iref=allsearch Ukrainians renew tent protest], [[CNN]] (5 March 2001)</ref> He was also one of the "faces of the [[Orange revolution]]". From 1991, Lutsenko was a long-term member of the [[Socialist Party of Ukraine]] (SPU); prior to his appointment to the executive branch, he was people's deputy in the [[Verkhovna Rada]] (the Ukrainian parliament) beginning in February 2002. Lutsenko belonged to the a pro-European faction akin to social democratic parties in the rest of Europe, rather than a post-Soviet conservative socialism.

As a Minister, Lutsenko refused to run in the [[2006 Ukrainian parliamentary election|2006 parliamentary election]] on his party list. However, he has run for both the [[Kyivrada|Kyiv City Council]] and Rivne Oblast Council simultaneously in the lists of the Socialist Party – "to make the point", as he explained. Having won these seats, Lutsenko resigned from both in favor of his Minister's position as the [[Constitution of Ukraine]] prohibits occupying positions in the legislative and executive branches of the government at the same time.

===Resignation from the Socialist Party===
After his appointment as a minister, Lutsenko suspended his membership of the SPU in the summer of 2006 as a result of the party leader [[Oleksandr Moroz]]'s entering into a Parliamentary coalition with the [[Communist Party of Ukraine]] and the [[Party of Regions]] of the previous PM [[Yanukovych]]. When the Parliamentary coalition of the [[Party of Regions]], the [[Communist Party of Ukraine|Communists]], and the defected [[Socialist Party of Ukraine|Socialists]] began to take shape, Lutsenko stated flatly that he refused to continue serving as the minister in a future government formed by these parties. However, after President [[Viktor Yushchenko]] agreed to allow the forming of the cabinet in exchange for several [[concession (politics)|political concessions]] including the ability to pick the Minister of Interior, Lutsenko stated that the president asked him personally to remain as the minister, and he would do so.

Lutsenko was formally dismissed by the [[Verkhovna Rada]] on 1 December 2006.<ref name="411-V">{{Cite web|url=http://zakon1.rada.gov.ua/cgi-bin/laws/main.cgi?nreg=411-16|title=On dismissal of Yuriy Lutsenko from position of Minister of Internal Affairs|date=1 December 2006|language=Ukrainian}}</ref> Lutsenko then (December 2006) created [[Civil Movement "People's Self-Defense"]].<ref>[http://www.nrcu.gov.ua/index.php/java/index.php?id=148&listid=38877 Yuriy Lutsenko's initiative to create civil movement "People's self-defense" supported by political party "Ukraine, onward!"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120223135329/http://www.nrcu.gov.ua/index.php/java/index.php?id=148&listid=38877 |date=23 February 2012 }}, [[Radio Ukraine]] (25 December 2006)</ref>

18 December 2007, Lutsenko again became minister of Internal Affairs, when [[Yulia Tymoshenko]] was again elected [[Prime Minister of Ukraine]].

===Incident at Frankfurt Airport===
In early May 2009, Lutsenko became entangled in a scandal concerning his behaviour during a visit to Germany. According to [[Newspapers in Germany|German newspaper]] [[Bild]] Oleksandr Lutsenko, his son, was detained at [[Frankfurt Airport]] by the [[German police]] in a state of acute alcohol intoxication. The Ukrainian Interior Ministry dismissed these allegations. According to the information of the Ministry, on 4 May 2009, the Interior Ministry's delegation was detained at the Frankfurt airport during document checks, and missed the flight.  The flight crew refused to take them on board. The delegation decided to catch the next flight. "There were no handcuffs, no drunken conflict," the department said. On 12 May 2009, Yuri Lutsenko sent in his resignation from the post of interior minister. In his [[letter of resignation]] the Minister described the incident that happened in [[Frankfurt]], and stressed that the German police had officially apologized to the Ukrainian delegation for this incident; but that despite this, German mass media disseminated false publications, which were later re-published by Ukrainian media. He said none of these publications mentioned the apologies of the German police. Lutsenko was confident that a dirty campaign had been waged against him in Ukraine. The aim of the campaign, according to him, was to destabilize the work of the Interior Ministry.<ref name=incident>[http://www.unian.net/eng/news/news-315132.html Lutsenko sent in his resignation from post of Interior Minister], [[UNIAN]] (12 May 2009)</ref>

The [[Ukrainian Parliament]] has to agree with the resignation of a Minister before the Minister can leave her/his post. On 15 May 2009, it passed a resolution, stipulating to address the government with a request to suspend Yuri Lutsenko from the post of the Interior Minister of Ukraine until the "drunken incident" is investigated.<ref>[http://www.unian.net/eng/news/news-315779.html Verkhovna Rada asks government to suspend Lutsenko from post], [[UNIAN]] (15 May 2009)</ref>

From 12 May 2009 till 14 May 2009 and again on 15 May 2009, the faction members of the [[Opposition (parliamentary)|oppositional]] [[Party of Regions]] blocked the [[Ukrainian parliament]]'s rostrum and presidium demanding the resignation of Lutsenko.  They placed (in the session hall) posters with inscriptions: "A Drunkard Minister is a shame for Ukraine", "Drunk policeman is a criminal" and "Drunk Minister –a politician?".<ref>[http://www.unian.net/eng/news/news-315138.html Party of Regions MPs blocked parliament’s rostrum and presidium], [[UNIAN]] (12 May 2009)</ref><ref name=blocked/><ref>[http://www.interfax.com.ua/eng/main/13810/ Regions Party unblocks parliament, break until Friday announced] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120229123417/http://www.interfax.com.ua/eng/main/13810/ |date=29 February 2012 }}, [[Interfax-Ukraine]] (14 May 2009)</ref><ref>[http://www.unian.net/eng/news/news-315745.html Party of Regions again blocks parliament’s rostrum and presidium], [[UNIAN]] (15 May 2009)</ref><ref>[http://www.unian.net/eng/news/news-315784.html Lutsenko about Yanukovych: he was a convict, and he will die as convict], [[UNIAN]] (15 May 2009)</ref>

Later, on 12 May 2009, Lutsenko claimed he would sue Bild. According to Lutsenko, the publication does not contain "any true things, any references to documents or real officials".<ref>[http://www.unian.net/eng/news/news-315155.html Lutsenko to sue Bild, which published story about drunken incident], [[UNIAN]] (12 May 2009)</ref>

[[President of Ukraine|President]] [[Viktor Yushchenko]] considered his appeal for resignation "a logical step, which should be made ... There was an incident which damaged the reputation of the state, the government and the minister himself. It must be settled with due regard for the interests of the nation and the country".<ref name=blocked>[http://www.unian.net/eng/news/news-315406.html Party of Regions blocks session], [[UNIAN]] (13 May 2009)</ref> Prime Minister [[Yulia Tymoshenko]] believed that the information about the incident is doubtful. "I may state that the son of the Interior Minister is a child ill with cancer; he underwent a very serious operation. This child is taking special medicines that are incompatible with alcohol drinking. Besides, no tests were made. I'm confident that this child had nothing in common at all with alcohol. And this untruth, which was publicized many times, casts doubt upon the whole information".<ref>[http://www.unian.net/eng/news/news-315585.html Tymoshenko about Lutsenko: show from scratch], [[UNIAN]] (14 May 2009)</ref> The Party of Regions faction insisted on accepting the resignation of Lutsenko without getting any proof of the incident at Frankfurt airport. The [[Yulia Tymoshenko Bloc]] faction refused to support the resignation of the interior minister without any proof concerning the incident. The [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] has asked Germany for official information about the incident, but got no response.<ref>[http://www.unian.net/eng/news/news-315253.html Factions to continue talks to unblock Verkhovna Rada's work], [[UNIAN]] (13 May 2009)</ref>

On 15 May 2009, the Ukrainian parliament passed a resolution asking the government to hold a seven-day official investigation into the events at Frankfurt Airport (first deputy [interior] minister Mykhailo Kliuyev served as acting Minister that period).<ref>[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/nation/detail/41597/ Speaker:Lutsenko suspended as Ukraine's interior minister], [[Kyiv Post]] (18 May 2009)</ref><ref>[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/nation/detail/41499/ Kliuyev to serve as Ukraine's interior minister during Lutsenko's suspension from duty], [[Kyiv Post]] (16 May 2009)</ref> After that Lutsenko resumed at his post.<ref>[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/nation/detail/42263/ Lutsenko says he will resume fulfilling duties as interior minister], [[Kyiv Post]] (27 May 2009)</ref>

On 10 June 2011, Bild retracted the report about the events at Frankfurt Airport after being ordered so by the [[Landgericht Berlin]].<ref>[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/nation/detail/43149/ German newspaper Bild retracts report on drunken incident with Lutsenko's son at Frankfurt airpor], [[Kyiv Post]] (10 June 2009)</ref>
