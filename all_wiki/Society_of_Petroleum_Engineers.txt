==History==
The history of the SPE began well before its actual establishment. During the decade after the 1901 discovery of the Spindletop field, the [[American Institute of Mining Engineers]] ([[American Institute of Mining, Metallurgical, and Petroleum Engineers|AIME]]) saw a growing need for a forum in the booming new field of petroleum engineering. As a result, AIME formed a standing committee on oil and gas in 1913.

In 1922, the committee was expanded to become one of AIME's 10 professional divisions. The Petroleum Division of AIME continued to grow throughout the next three decades. By 1950, the Petroleum Division had become one of three separate branches of AIME, and in 1957 the Petroleum Branch of AIME was expanded once again to form a professional society.

SPE became tax-exempt in March 1985.

The first SPE Board of Directors meeting was held 6 October 1957, making 2007 the 50th anniversary year for SPE as a professional society. 6 October 2017 was the 60th anniversary of SPE. In the last sixty years SPE has endeavored to provide resources to petroleum engineers where they need them most. SPE continues to operate more than 100 events around the world, and publish technically relevant information online, in-print, and delivered to their member inboxes. SPE offers a wide array of awards and scholarships to recognize industry champions and future leaders.

=== Books ===
SPE has published many books over the years. The ''Petroleum Engineering Handbook''(''PEH'') was a seven-volume series SPE published. The individual handbooks are still available in digital and print formats.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://store.spe.org/PE-handbooks-C7.aspx|title=PE handbooks|website=store.spe.org|access-date=2017-12-26}}</ref>

SPE continues to publish new books on practical applications of new technologies that may be used to produce oil and natural gas more efficiently. SPE book authors sometimes attend book signings at the Annual Technical Conference and Exhibition. SPE's bookstore offers books on drilling, enhanced oil recovery, and reservoir characterization. SPE members receive a significant discount on purchases through the SPE Bookstore.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.spe.org/members/benefits.php|title=Professional Membership Benefits {{!}} Society of Petroleum Engineers|website=www.spe.org|access-date=2017-12-26}}</ref>

==PetroWiki==
PetroWiki was created from the seven-volume ''Petroleum Engineering Handbook''. PetroWiki preserves ''PEH'' content in unaltered form (page names that start with PEH:), while allowing SPE's membership to update and expand content from the published version. Pages that do not have "PEH:" at the beginning may have started with content from the PEH, but have been modified over time by contributors to the wiki.

Content in PetroWiki is moderated by at least two members with subject matter expertise. This helps to ensure that the information found in PetroWiki is technically accurate.

Unlike some other online wikis, PetroWiki content is copyrighted by SPE.

== OnePetro ==
Launched in March 2007, OnePetro.org is a multi-society library that allows users to search for and access a broad range of technical literature related to the oil and gas exploration and production industry. OnePetro is a multi-association effort that reflects participation of many organizations. The Society of Petroleum Engineers (SPE) operates OnePetro on behalf of the participating organizations. SPE operates and provides customer service support for OnePetro.

OnePetro currently contains more than 200,000 documents, with more being added frequently. The number of documents is expected to grow as additional organizations choose to make their materials available through OnePetro. OnePetro is the first online offering of documents from some organizations, making these materials widely available for the first time.

The following organizations currently have their technical documents available through OnePetro:
* [[American Petroleum Institute]] (API)
