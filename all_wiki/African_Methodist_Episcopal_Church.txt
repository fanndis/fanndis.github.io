The '''African Methodist Episcopal Church''', usually called the '''A.M.E. Church''' or '''AME''', is a [[Black church|predominantly African-American]] [[Methodist]] denomination. It is the first independent [[Protestant]] denomination to be founded by [[black people]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aia/part3/3p97.html|title=Richard Allen |publisher=PBS|accessdate=2017-09-07}}</ref> It was founded by the Rt. Rev. [[Richard Allen (bishop)|Richard Allen]] in [[Philadelphia]], Pennsylvania, in 1816 from several black Methodist congregations in the mid-Atlantic area that wanted independence from white Methodists. It was among the first denominations in the United States to be founded on racial rather than theological distinctions and has persistently advocated for the civil and human rights of African Americans through social improvement, religious autonomy, and political engagement. Allen, a deacon in [[Methodist Episcopal Church]], was consecrated its first bishop in 1816 by a conference of five churches from Philadelphia to Baltimore. The denomination then expanded west and south, particularly after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. By 1906, the AME had a membership of about 500,000, more than the combined total of the [[Colored Methodist Episcopal Church in America]] and the [[African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church]], making it the largest major African-American Methodist denomination. The AME currently has 20 districts, each with its own bishop: 13 are based in the United States, mostly in the South, while seven are based in Africa. The global membership of the AME is around 2.5 million and it remains one of the largest Methodist denominations in the world.

==Church name==
;African: The AME Church was created and organized by people of African descent (most descended from [[enslaved Africans]] taken to the Americas) as a response to being officially discriminated against by white congregants in the Methodist church. The church was not founded in Africa, nor is it exclusively for people of African descent. It is open and welcoming to people of all ethnic groups, origins, nationalities, and colors, although its congregations are predominantly made up of Black Americans.<ref>{{cite journal | url=https://www.evernote.com/shard/s66/sh/96ed377e-611a-4e39-a7ec-5f92e5bc9bae/2ef9ee9a8cfb75daec97ee3c96058355 | title=Our Own Vine and Fig Tree: The Authority of History and Kinship in Mother Bethel | author=Beck, Carolyn S. | journal=Review of Religious Research | year=1988 | volume=29 | issue=4 | pages=369–84 | doi=10.2307/3511576 | jstor=3511576}}</ref>

==Motto==

"God Our Father, Christ Our Redeemer, the Holy Spirit Our Comforter, Humankind Our Family"

Derived from Bishop [[Daniel Payne|Daniel Alexander Payne]]'s original motto "God our Father, Christ our Redeemer, Man our Brother", which served as the AME Church motto until the 2008 General Conference, when the current motto was officially adopted.

===Origins===
The AME Church grew out of the [[Free African Society]] (FAS), which [[Richard Allen (bishop)|Richard Allen]], [[Absalom Jones]], and other free blacks established in Philadelphia in 1787. They left [[St. George's United Methodist Church|St. George's Methodist Episcopal Church]] because of discrimination. Although Allen and Jones were both accepted as preachers, they were limited to black congregations. In addition, the blacks were made to sit in a separate gallery built in the church when their portion of the congregation increased. These former members of St. George's made plans to transform their mutual aid society into an African congregation. Although the group was originally non-denominational, eventually members wanted to affiliate with existing denominations.

Allen led a small group who resolved to remain Methodist. They formed the [[Mother Bethel A.M.E. Church|Bethel African Methodist Episcopal Church]] in 1793. In general, they adopted the doctrines and form of government of the [[Methodist Episcopal Church]]. In 1794 Bethel AME was dedicated with Allen as pastor. To establish Bethel's independence, Allen successfully sued in the Pennsylvania courts in 1807 and 1815 for the right of his congregation to exist as an institution independent of white Methodist congregations.

Because black Methodists in other middle Atlantic communities also encountered racism and desired religious autonomy, Allen called them to meet in Philadelphia in 1816 to form a new Wesleyan denomination. Sixteen representatives, from Bethel African Church in Philadelphia and African churches in Baltimore, MD, Wilmington, DE, Attleboro, PA, and Salem, NJ, met to form a church organization or connection under the title of the "African Methodist Episcopal Church" (AME Church).<ref>[https://archive.org/details/nationalcycloped01richrich The National Cyclopedia of The Colored Race],  Clement Richardson Editor-in-Chief, Volume One, p. 576, National Publishing Company, Inc., Montgomery, Alabama, 1919</ref>

===Growth===
It began with eight clergy and five churches, and by 1846 had grown to 176 clergy, 296 churches, and 17,375 members. The 20,000 members in 1856 were located primarily in the North.<ref name="James T. Campbell 1995">James T. Campbell, ''Songs of Zion: The African Methodist Episcopal Church in the United States and South Africa'' (1995)</ref><ref name="A. Nevell Owens 2014">A. Nevell Owens, ''Formation of the African Methodist Episcopal Church in the Nineteenth Century: Rhetoric of Identification'' (2014)</ref> AME national membership (including probationers and preachers) jumped from 70,000 in 1866 to 207,000 in 1876.<ref name="The Annual Cyclopedia 1866, p 492">''The Annual Cyclopedia: 1866," (1867) p. 492; ''The Annual Cyclopedia: 1876'' (1877) p. 532</ref>

[[File:Vesey.jpg|thumb|left|[[Denmark Vesey]] memorial in Hampton Park in Charleston, South Carolina]]
The church also expanded internationally during this period. The [[British Overseas Territory]] of [[Bermuda]], 640 miles from [[Cape Hatteras]], North Carolina, was settled in 1609 by the [[London Company|Virginia Company]] and retained close links with Virginia and the Carolinas (with [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]] settled from Bermuda in 1670 under [[William Sayle]]) for the next two centuries, with Bermudians playing both sides during the American War of Independence, being the point from which the blockade of southern Atlantic ports was maintained and the [[Chesapeake Campaign]] was launched during the [[War of 1812|American War of 1812]], and being the primary port through which European-manufactured weapons and supplies were smuggled into the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] during the [[American Civil War]]. Other Bermudians, such as First Sergeant [[Robert John Simmons]] of the [[54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry Regiment]], fought to end slavery in the United States.<ref>[http://www.royalgazette.com/article/20080809/ISLAND/308099993 ''Fighting to save America's soul''. The Royal Gazette. 9 August, 2008]</ref> Among the numerous residents of the American South with ties to Bermuda was [[Denmark Vesey]], who had immigrated to [[South Carolina]] from Bermuda as a slave before purchasing his freedom. Vesey was a founder of Mother [[Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church]] before his execution after conviction in a show trial resulting from white hysteria over an alleged conspiracy for a slave revolt in 1822.<ref>[http://www.royalgazette.com/article/20150627/NEWS/150629735 ''Bermudians remember slain US pastor'', by Owain Johnston-Barnes.

The majority of the population of Bermuda during the first century of settlement was European, with free and enslaved blacks primarily from the Spanish West Indies and Native Americans, primarily from New England (anyone not entirely of European ancestry was counted as ''coloured''). As any child of a coloured and a white parent was counted as coloured, the ratio of the white to coloured population shifted during the course of the 18th Century (4,850 whites and 3,514 coloured in 1721; but 4,755 whites and 5,425 coloured in 1811). The [[Anglican Church of Bermuda|Church of England]] is the established church, and was the only church originally permitted to operate in Bermuda. Presbyterians and Methodists were permitted to have separate churches and to conduct their own services during the 18th Century, but were not permitted to conduct baptisms, weddings, or funerals, which were the remit of the established church, until about the 1820s. The Wesleyan Methodists sought to include enslaved blacks and a law was passed by the [[Parliament of Bermuda]] in 1800 barring any but Church of England and Presbyterian ministers from preaching. The Methodist Reverend [[John Stephenson (minister)|John Stephenson]] was incarcerated in December, 1800, for six months for preaching to slaves.<ref>[http://www.bermudabiographies.bm/Biographies/Biography-John%20Stephenson.html ''John Stephenson, 1749–1819, Methodist Missionary''. Bermuda Biographies</ref> The law and attitudes changed during the course of the following century, but any church organised by blacks and organising blacks would not be welcomed by the wite dominated Government. The AME First District website records that in the autumn of 1869, ''three farsighted Christian men—Benjamin Burchall of St. George’s, William B. Jennings of Devonshire and Charles Roach Ratteray of Somerset—set in motion the wheels that brought African Methodism to'' Bermuda.<ref>[https://firstdistrictame.org/bermuda ''Welcome to the Bermuda Conference!''. Webstite of The First Episcopal District of the African Methodist Episcopal Church]</ref> By the latter Nineteenth Century, the law in Bermuda specified that any denomination permitted to operate in the United Kingdom should also be permitted in the colony (although only the Church of England, the Presbyterian Church, and the Wesleyan Methodists were permitted to conduct baptisms, weddings and funerals until after the First World War). As the Imperial Government had ruled that the AME Church could operate in the United Kingdom, the first AME church in Bermuda was erected in 1885 in [[Hamilton Parish]], on the shore of Harrington Sound, and titled St. John African Methodist Episcopal Church. Although the Church of England (since 1978, titled the Anglican Church of Bermuda) remains the largest denomination in Bermuda (15.8%), the AME quickly flourished (accounting for 8.6% of the population today), overtaking the Wesleyan Methodists (2.7% today).

===Education===
AME put a high premium on education. In the 19th century, the AME Church of Ohio collaborated with the Methodist Episcopal Church, a predominantly white denomination, in sponsoring the second independent [[Historically black colleges and universities|historically black college (HBCU)]], [[Wilberforce University]] in Ohio. By 1880, AME operated over 2,000 schools, chiefly in the South, with 155,000 students. For school houses they used church buildings; the ministers and their wives were the teachers; the congregations raised the money to keep schools operating at a time the segregated public schools were starved of funds.<ref>William E. Montgomery, ''Under Their Own Vine and Fig Tree: The African-American Church in the South, 1865–1900'' (1993) pp. 148–52.</ref>

===Bishop Turner===
After the Civil War Bishop [[Henry McNeal Turner]] (1834–1915) was a major leader of the AME and played a role in Republican Party politics. In 1863 during the Civil War, Turner was appointed as the first black chaplain in the [[United States Colored Troops]].  Afterward, he was appointed to the [[Freedmen's Bureau]] in Georgia. He settled in Macon, Georgia, and was elected to the state legislature in 1868 during Reconstruction. He planted many AME churches in Georgia after the war.<ref name="Stephen Ward Angell 1992">Stephen Ward Angell, ''Henry McNeal Turner and African-American Religion in the South'', (1992)</ref>

In 1880 he was elected as the first southern bishop of the AME Church after a fierce battle within the denomination. Angered by the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]]' regaining power and instituting [[Jim Crow]] laws in the late nineteenth century South, Turner was the leader of black nationalism and proposed emigration of blacks to Africa.<ref name="Stephen Ward Angell 1992"/>

===Race===
The African Methodist Episcopal Church has a unique history as it is the first major religious denomination in the western world that developed because of race rather than theological differences. It was the first African-American denomination organized and incorporated in the United States. The church was born in protest against racial discrimination and slavery. This was in keeping with the Methodist Church's philosophy, whose founder [[John Wesley]] had once called the slave-trade "that execrable sum of all villainies." In the 19th century, the AME Church of Ohio collaborated with the Methodist Episcopal Church, a predominantly white denomination, in sponsoring the second independent historically black college (HBCU), [[Wilberforce University]] in Ohio. Among Wilberforce University's early founders was [[Salmon P. Chase]], then-governor of Ohio and the future [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|Secretary of Treasury]] under President [[Abraham Lincoln]].

Other members of the FAS wanted to affiliate with the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]] and followed [[Absalom Jones]] in doing that. In 1792, they founded the [[African Episcopal Church of St. Thomas]], the first Episcopal church in the United States with a founding black congregation. In 1804, Jones was ordained as the first black priest in the [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopal Church]].

While the AME is doctrinally Methodist, clergy, scholars, and lay persons have written works that demonstrate the distinctive racial theology and ''[[Praxis (Orthodox)|praxis]]'' that have come to define this Wesleyan body. In an address to the 1893 World's Parliament of Religions, Bishop [[Benjamin W. Arnett]] reminded the audience of blacks' influence in the formation of Christianity. Bishop [[Benjamin Tucker Tanner|Benjamin T. Tanner]] wrote in 1895 in ''The Color of Solomon – What?'' that biblical scholars wrongly portrayed the son of David as a white man. In the post-[[civil rights]] era, theologians [[James Cone (theologian)|James Cone]],<ref>[http://www.utsnyc.edu/Page.aspx?&pid=353 "Dr. Cone is an ordained minister in the (A.M.E.) church." (Union Theological Seminary's URL)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930193421/http://www.utsnyc.edu/Page.aspx?&pid=353 |date=2011-09-30 }}</ref> Cecil W. Cone, and Jacqueline Grant, who came from the AME tradition, criticized Euro-centric Christianity and African-American churches for their shortcomings in resolving the plight of those oppressed by racism, sexism, and economic disadvantage.<ref>James H. Cone, ''Black theology and black power'' (2nd ed. 1997).</ref><ref>Jacquelyn Grant, ''White Woman's Christ and Black Woman's Jesus'' (1989)</ref>

==Beliefs==
The AME motto, "God Our Father, Christ Our Redeemer, Holy Spirit Our Comforter, Humankind Our Family", reflects the basic beliefs of the African Methodist Episcopal Church.

The basic foundations of the beliefs of the church can be summarized in the [[Apostles' Creed]], and The Twenty Five [[Articles of Religion (Methodist)|Articles of Religion]], held in common with other Methodist Episcopal congregations. The church also observes the official bylaws of the AME Church. The "Doctrine and Discipline of the African Methodist Episcopal Church" is revised at every General Conference and published every four years. The AME church also follows the rule that a minister of the denomination must retire at age 75,<ref>{{Cite news|url = http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/faith_and_values/2008/03/21/webster.ART_ART_03-21-08_B7_AH9M5IK.html|title = Legacy of retiring AME bishop includes health center|last = Heagney|first = Meredith|date = March 21, 2008|work = [[The Columbus Dispatch]]|access-date = June 18, 2015}}</ref> with bishops, more specifically, being required to retire upon the General Conference nearest their 75th birthday.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.ame-church.com/our-church/our-structure/|title = Our Structure|accessdate = June 18, 2015|website = African Methodist Episcopal Church}}</ref>

==Structure==

===The General Conference===

The General Conference is the supreme body of the African Methodist Episcopal Church. It is composed of the Bishops, as ''[[ex officio]]'' presidents, according to the rank of election, and an equal number of ministerial and lay delegates, elected by each of the Annual Conferences and the lay Electoral Colleges of the Annual Conferences. Other ''ex officio'' members are: the General Officers, College Presidents, Deans of Theological Seminaries; Chaplains in the Regular Armed Forces of the U.S.A. The General Conference meets every four years, but may have extra sessions in certain emergencies.

At the General Conference of the A.M.E. Church, notable and renowned speakers have been invited to address the clergy and laity of the congregation. Such as in 2008, the church invited then [https://news.stlpublicradio.org/post/obama-preaches-african-methodist-episcopal-gathering-about-self-reliance#stream/0 Senator] [[Barack Obama|Barack H. Obama]], and in 2012, the church invited then [https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/blog/2012/06/30/first-lady-michelle-obama-african-methodist-episcopal-churchs-general-conference First Lady of the United States] [[Michelle Obama]].

===Council of Bishops===

The Council of Bishops is the Executive Branch of the Connectional Church. It has the general oversight of the Church during the interim between General Conferences. The Council of Bishops shall meet annually at such time and place as the majority of the Council shall determine and also at such other times as may be deemed necessary in the discharging its responsibility as the Executive Branch of the African Methodist Episcopal Church. The Council of Bishops shall hold at least two public sessions at each annual meeting. At the first, complaints and petitions against a Bishop shall be heard, at the second, the decisions of the Council shall be made public. All decisions shall be in writing.

===Board of Incorporators===

The Board of Incorporators, also known as the General Board of Trustees, has the supervision, in trust, of all connectional property of the Church and is vested with authority to act in behalf of the Connectional Church wherever necessary.

===The General Board===

The General Board is in many respects the administrative body and comprises various departmental Commissions made up of the respective Secretary-Treasurer, the General Secretary of the AME Church, the General Treasurer and the members of the various Commissions and one Bishop as presiding officer with the other Bishops associating.

===Judicial Council===

The Judicial Council is the highest judicatory body of the African Methodist Episcopal Church. It is an appellate court, elected by the General Conference and is amenable to it.

===AME Connectional Health Commission===

The Connectional Health Commission serves, among other tasks, to help the denomination understand health as an integral part of the faith of the Christian Church, to seek to make our denomination a healing faith community, and to promote the health concerns of its members. One of the initiatives of the commission is the establishment of an interactive website that will allow not only health directors, but the AMEC membership at-large to access health information, complete reports, request assistance. This website serves as a resource for members of the AMEC, and will be the same for anyone who accesses the website. Additionally, as this will be an interactive site, it will allow health directors to enter a password protected chat room to discuss immediate needs and coordinate efforts for relief regionally, nationally and globally.

It is through this website that efforts to distribute information about resources and public health updates, and requests for services may be coordinated nationally. This will allow those who access the website to use one central location for all resource information needs.<ref>[http://www.amechealth.org AMECHealth.org AME Connectional Health Commission]</ref>
