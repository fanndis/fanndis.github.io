From late 2010, Kim Jong-un was viewed as successor to the leadership of North Korea. Following [[Death and state funeral of Kim Jong-il|the elder Kim's death]] in December 2011, state television announced him as the "Great Successor".

[[Media of North Korea|North Korean state media]] often refers to him as "the Marshal" or "Dear Respected".

Kim's leadership has followed the same [[North Korean cult of personality|cult of personality]] as his grandfather and father. In 2014, a [[UNHRC]] [[Report of the Commission of Inquiry on Human Rights in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea|report]] suggested that Kim could be put on trial for [[crimes against humanity]]. He has ordered the [[List of officials purged and executed by Kim Jong-un|purge or execution of several North Korean officials]]; he is also widely believed to have ordered [[Assassination of Kim Jong-nam|the 2017 assassination]] of his half-brother, [[Kim Jong-nam]], in [[Malaysia]]. He has presided over an expansion of the consumer economy, construction projects and [[Tourism in North Korea|tourist attractions]]. Kim also expanded [[Nuclear program of North Korea|North Korea's nuclear program]] which led to heightened tensions in the [[2017–18 North Korea crisis]]. In 2018 and 2019, Kim took part in a diplomatic process, meeting with [[President of South Korea|South Korean President]] [[Moon Jae-in]] and [[President of the United States|US President]] [[Donald Trump]].

[[File:Schule Liebefeld-Steinhölzli, Köniz.jpg|thumb|left|The Liebefeld-Steinhölzli public school in [[Köniz]], [[Switzerland]], which Kim Jong-un is reported to have attended]]
Later, it was reported that Kim Jong-un attended the Liebefeld Steinhölzli [[state school]] in [[Köniz]] near Bern under the name "Pak-un" or "Un-pak" from 1998 until 2000 as the son of an employee of the North Korean embassy in Bern. Authorities confirmed that a North Korean student from North Korea attended the school during that period. Pak-un first attended a special class for foreign-language children and later attended the regular classes of the 6th, 7th, 8th and part of the final 9th year, leaving the school abruptly in the autumn of 2000.

=== Role in government ===
According to the North Korean constitution, Kim Jong-un is part of a [[triumvirate]] heading the executive branch of the North Korean government along with Premier [[Kim Tok-hun]] and parliament president [[Choe Ryong-hae]]. Each nominally holds powers equivalent to a third of a president's powers in most presidential systems. Kim Jong-un commands the armed forces, Kim Tok-hun heads the government and handles domestic affairs, and Choe Ryong-hae handles foreign relations. However, under the constitution, Kim Jong-un is by far the highest-ranking of the three. Since 1998, the NDC chairmanship has been constitutionally defined as "the highest post in the state,"<ref>{{cite book|last=Kleiner|first=Jürgen|title=Korea, a Century of Change|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nTCC2ZheFu0C&pg=PA291|year=2001|publisher=World Scientific|location=River Edge|isbn=978-981-279-995-1|p=296}}</ref> and a constitutional amendment enacted by Kim Jong-un explicitly named the NDC (first) chairman as "the supreme leader of the Democratic People's Republic of North Korea".<ref name="leon_DPRK">{{cite web |title=DPRK has quietly amended its Constitution |last=Petrov |first=Leonid |work=Leonid Petrov's KOREA VISION |date=12 October 2009 |access-date=12 September 2015 |url=https://leonidpetrov.wordpress.com/2009/10/12/dprk-has-quietly-amended-its-constitution/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016015037/https://leonidpetrov.wordpress.com/2009/10/12/dprk-has-quietly-amended-its-constitution/ |archive-date=16 October 2015}}<br/>{{cite book |series=Amended and supplemented on 1 April, Juche 102 (2013), at the Seventh Session of the Twelfth Supreme People's Assembly |title=Socialist Constitution of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea |chapter-url=http://www.naenara.com.kp/en/book/download.php?4+4047 |year=2014 |chapter-format=PDF |publisher=Foreign Languages Publishing House |location=Pyongyang |isbn=978-9946-0-1099-1 |page=22 |chapter=Article 100 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160608030306/http://www.naenara.com.kp/en/book/download.php?4+4047 |archive-date=8 June 2016}}</ref> However, analysts are divided about how much actual power Kim has.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/27/kim-jong-un-north-korea-supreme-leader-or-state-puppet |title=Kim Jong-un: North Korea's supreme leader or state puppet? |work=The Guardian |date=27 May 2014 |access-date=2 November 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190918030909/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/27/kim-jong-un-north-korea-supreme-leader-or-state-puppet |archive-date=18 September 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nknews.org/2017/03/the-myth-of-kim-jong-uns-absolute-power/ |title=The myth of Kim Jong Un's absolute power |first=Peter |last=Ward |publisher=NK News |date=20 March 2017 |access-date=2 November 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170320114329/https://www.nknews.org/2017/03/the-myth-of-kim-jong-uns-absolute-power/ |archive-date=20 March 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>

===New leadership style===
In July 2012, Kim Jong-un showed a change in cultural policy from his father by attending a [[Moranbong Band]] concert. The concert contained several elements of pop culture from [[Western culture|the West]], particularly the United States. Kim used this event to introduce his wife to the public, an unprecedented move in North Korea.<ref>Lankov, Andrei (10 April 2013).

In 2012, Kim Jong-il's personal chef Kenji Fujimoto visited North Korea and said, "Stores in Pyongyang were brimming with products and people in the streets looked cheerful. North Korea has changed a lot since Kim Jong-un assumed power. All of this is because of leader Kim Jong-un."<ref name="McCurry2012">{{cite web |first=Justin |last=McCurry |date=10 August 2012 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/10/kim-jong-il-japan-chef |title=Kim Jong‑il's personal Japanese chef returns to land he fled |work=The Guardian |archive-date=2 July 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150702173449/http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/10/kim-jong-il-japan-chef |url-status=live |location=London |issn=0261-3077 }}</ref>

In April 2012, when a satellite launch failed, the government admitted this publicly, the first time it had ever done so.<ref name=Pak/> In May 2014, following the collapse of an apartment building in Pyongyang, Kim Jong-un was said to be very upset at the loss of life that resulted.

=== Economic policies ===
A set of comprehensive economic measures, the "Socialist Corporate Responsible Management System", were introduced in 2013.<ref name="IFES1" /> The measures increase the autonomy of enterprises by granting them "certain rights to engage in business activities autonomously and elevate the will to labor through appropriately implementing the socialist distribution system". Another priority of economic policies that year was agriculture, where the ''pojon'' (vegetable garden) responsibility system was implemented. The system reportedly achieved a major increase in output in some collective farms.<ref name="IFES1">{{cite web |url=http://ifes.kyungnam.ac.kr/eng/FRM/FRM_0101V.aspx?code=FRM150224_0001 |title="Socialist Enterprise Management System" under Full Implementation |publisher=Institute for Far Eastern Studies |date=24 February 2015 |access-date=28 April 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150702134340/http://ifes.kyungnam.ac.kr/eng/FRM/FRM_0101V.aspx?code=FRM150224_0001 |archive-date=2 July 2015}}</ref>
North Korean media were describing the economy as a "flexible collectivist system" where enterprises were applying "active and evolutionary actions" to achieve economic development.<ref name="IFES2" /> These reports reflect Kim's general economic policy of reforming management, increasing the autonomy and incentives for economic actors. This set of reforms known as the "May 30th measures" reaffirms both socialist ownership and "objective economic laws in guidance and management" to improve living standards. Other objectives of the measures are to increase the availability of domestically manufactured goods on markets, introduction of defence innovations into the civilian sector and boost international trade.<ref name="IFES2">{{cite web |url=http://ifes.kyungnam.ac.kr/eng/FRM/FRM_0101V.aspx?code=FRM150115_0001 |title=Kim Jong Un Stresses the Principles of Market Economy through 'May 30th Measures' |publisher=Institute for Far Eastern Studies |date=15 January 2015 |access-date=28 April 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150702103857/http://ifes.kyungnam.ac.kr/eng/FRM/FRM_0101V.aspx?code=FRM150115_0001 |archive-date=2 July 2015}}</ref>
