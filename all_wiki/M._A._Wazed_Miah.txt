His thesis was on the [[Bootstrap model|bootstrap hypothesis]] in theoretical particle physics, and he worked under Professor E. J. Squires.

==Political career==
From 1961 to 1962 he was the Vice-President of the [[Fazlul Huq Muslim Hall]] unit East Pakistan Muslim Chhatra League (currently known as [[Bangladesh Chhatra League]]) at [[University of Dhaka]].

On 1 April 1963, Miah found employment with the [[Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission]] (PAEC), initially attached to the Atomic Energy Research Center (AERC) in Karachi.<ref name="Star" /> In 1969, Miah got an associateship at the [[International Centre for Theoretical Physics]] in Italy. In the same year, he returned home to Pakistan and continued with the AERC.<ref name="Star" /> In Karachi, Miah was the chief scientist at the [[Karachi Nuclear Power Plant]] but had his security [[security clearance]] revoked, that led to termination of his contract and his migration to Bangladesh.{{citation needed|date=June 2020}}

He was engaged in research work at the New Delhi-based laboratory of the [[Atomic Energy Commission of India]] during 1975–1982, during the period of exile of the remainder of the Mujib family after the bloody [[15 August 1975 Bangladesh coup d'état]].
