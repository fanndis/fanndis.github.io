==Career==
A longtime member of the [[Christian Democratic Union (East Germany)|East German Christian Democratic Union]], Maizière helped oust the party's pro-Communist leadership after the [[fall of the Berlin Wall]].  He was elected the party's chairman in November.<ref name="auto"/> In the first—and as it turned out, only—[[1990 East German general election|free election held in East Germany]], Maizière was elected to the ''[[Volkskammer]].''  One month later, he succeeded [[Hans Modrow]] as Premier<ref>{{cite book|first=Peter E. |last=Quint|title= The Imperfect Union: Constitutional Structures of German Unification|publisher= [[Princeton University Press]]|year= 2012 |page=42}}</ref> and held this position from 12 April until 2 October 1990, heading the [[de Maizière cabinet]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cvce.eu/en/obj/address_given_by_lothar_de_maiziere_on_the_eve_of_german_unity_berlin_2_october_1990-en-ab701e58-27c1-49a5-b9fb-ef6e70e0d61b.html|title=Address given by Lothar de Maizière on the eve of German unity (Berlin, 2 October 1990)|date=25 October 2012|publisher=cvce.eu}}</ref>  He ran on a platform of speedy [[German reunification|reunification]] with the Federal Republic of Germany (from 1949 to 1990, [[West Germany]]).  As premier, Maizière signed the [[Treaty on the Final Settlement with Respect to Germany]] (the so-called "Two Plus Four Treaty"),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://chnm.gmu.edu/1989/items/show/290|title=Treaty on the Final Settlement with Respect to Germany - Making the History of 1989|website=www.chnm.gmu.edu|accessdate=February 7, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190507212058/http://chnm.gmu.edu/1989/items/show/290|archive-date=7 May 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cvce.eu/en/collections/unit-content/-/unit/df06517b-babc-451d-baf6-a2d4b19c1c88/80442829-047c-479a-afaf-18be757f1232/Resources|title=Resources for The Treaty on the Final Settlement with respect to Germany - Subject files - CVCE Website|website=www.cvce.eu|accessdate=February 7, 2017}}</ref> which ended the four wartime allied powers' rights and responsibilities in Berlin and Germany, and which preceded [[German reunification]].  The treaty provided that it would be signed by the four allies and the two Germanies but ratified only by newly reunified Germany and the allies.  In accordance with that treaty, East Germany ceased to exist on 3 October, and its territory was annexed by the Federal Republic.

After German reunification, he was appointed Minister for Special Affairs in the [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany|CDU]] government of chancellor [[Helmut Kohl]], until his resignation on 17 December 1990 amid rumours that he had worked for the East German [[Stasi]] (Stasi name: IM Czerni<ref>https://www.zeit.de/1992/05/neues-von-czerni</ref>).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.chronikderwende.de/english/biography_jsp/key=e_de+maizi%25e8re_lothar.html|title=Biography: Lothar de Maizière - Biographies - Chronik der Wende|website=www.chronikderwende.de|accessdate=7 February 2017}}</ref>
