The '''World Trade Organization''' ('''WTO''') is an [[intergovernmental organization]] that is concerned with the regulation of [[international trade]] between nations. The WTO officially commenced on 1 January 1995 under the [[Marrakesh Agreement]], signed by 123 nations on 15 April 1994, replacing the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] (GATT), which commenced in 1948. It is the largest international economic organization in the world.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.nber.org/reporter/winter00/krueger.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=20 May 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170518033322/http://www.nber.org/reporter/winter00/krueger.html |archive-date=18 May 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/whatis_e/tif_e/fact4_e.htm|title=WTO – Understanding the WTO – The GATT years: from Havana to Marrakesh|website=www.wto.org|access-date=28 March 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180305153601/https://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/whatis_e/tif_e/fact4_e.htm|archive-date=5 March 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

==History==
{{Main|History of the World Trade Organization}}
[[File:WhiteandKeynes.jpg|thumb|right| The economists [[Harry Dexter White|Harry White]] (left) and [[John Maynard Keynes]] at the [[Bretton Woods Conference]].<ref>A.E. Eckes Jr., ''US Trade History'', 73<br />* A. Smithies, ''Reflections on the Work of Keynes'', 578–601<br />* N. Warren, ''Internet and Globalization'', 193</ref>]]

The WTO precursor [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] (GATT), was established by a multilateral treaty of 23 countries in 1947 after [[World War II]] in the wake of other new multilateral institutions dedicated to international economic cooperation—such as the [[World Bank]] (founded 1944) and the [[International Monetary Fund]] (founded 1944 or 1945). A comparable international institution for trade, named the [[International Trade Organization]] never started as the [[United States|U.S]]. and other signatories did not ratify the establishment treaty,<ref>P. van den Bossche, ''The Law and Policy of the World Trade Organization'', 80</ref><ref>Palmeter-Mavroidis, ''Dispute Settlement'', 2</ref><ref name="CRS-2007-pg 4">{{cite web |url= http://www.nationalaglawcenter.org/wp-content/uploads/assets/crs/98-928.pdf |title= The World Trade Organization: Background and Issues |last= Fergusson |first= Ian F. |date= 9 May 2007 |publisher= [[Congressional Research Service]] |page= 4 |access-date= 15 August 2008 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130927183136/http://www.nationalaglawcenter.org/wp-content/uploads/assets/crs/98-928.pdf |archive-date= 27 September 2013 |url-status= live }}</ref> and so GATT slowly became a ''[[de facto]]'' international organization.<ref name="B81">It was contemplated that the GATT would apply for several years until the ITO came into force. However, since the ITO never materialized, the GATT gradually became the focus for international governmental cooperation on trade matters, with economist Nicholas Halford overseeing the implementation of GATT in members' policies.

===GATT negotiations before Uruguay===
{{See also|General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade}}

Seven rounds of negotiations occurred under [[GATT]] (1949 to 1979). The first real{{cn|date=March 2020}} GATT trade rounds (1947 to 1960) concentrated on further reducing [[tariff]]s. Then the [[Kennedy Round]] in the mid-sixties brought about a GATT [[Dumping (pricing policy)|anti-dumping]] agreement and a section on development. The Tokyo Round during the seventies represented the first major attempt to tackle trade barriers that do not take the form of tariffs, and to improve the system, adopting a series of agreements on  [[Non-tariff barriers to trade|non-tariff barriers]], which in some cases interpreted existing GATT rules, and in others broke entirely new ground. Because not all GATT members accepted these [[plurilateral agreement]]s, they were often informally called "codes". (The Uruguay Round amended several of these codes and turned them into multilateral commitments accepted by all WTO members. Only four remained plurilateral (those on government procurement, bovine meat, civil aircraft and dairy products), but in 1997 WTO members agreed to terminate the bovine meat and dairy agreements, leaving only two.<ref name="GY">[http://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/whatis_e/tif_e/fact4_e.htm The GATT Years: from Havana to Marrakesh] {{Webarchive|url= https://web.archive.org/web/20041211025038/http://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/whatis_e/tif_e/fact4_e.htm |date= 11 December 2004 }}, WTO official site</ref>) Despite attempts in the mid-1950s and 1960s to establish some form of institutional mechanism for international trade, the GATT continued to operate for almost half a century as a semi-institutionalized multilateral treaty régime on a provisional basis.<ref name="F17">

===Uruguay Round: 1986–1994===
{{main|Uruguay Round}}

Well before GATT's 40th anniversary, its members concluded that the GATT system was straining to adapt to a new [[globalization|globalizing]] world economy.<ref name="G4">P. Gallagher, ''The First Ten Years of the WTO'', 4</ref><ref name="UR">[http://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/whatis_e/tif_e/fact5_e.htm The Uruguay Round] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070320103620/http://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/whatis_e/tif_e/fact5_e.htm |date=20 March 2007 }}, WTO official site</ref> In response to the problems identified in the 1982 Ministerial Declaration (structural deficiencies, spill-over impacts of certain countries' policies on world trade GATT could not manage, etc.), the eighth GATT round—known as the Uruguay Round—was launched in September 1986, in [[Punta del Este]], Uruguay.<ref name="G4" />

It was the biggest negotiating mandate on trade ever agreed: the talks aimed to extend the trading system into several new areas, notably trade in services and intellectual property, and to reform trade in the sensitive sectors of agriculture and textiles; all the original GATT articles were up for review.<ref name="UR"/> The Final Act concluding the [[Uruguay]] Round and officially establishing the WTO regime was signed 15 April 1994, during the ministerial meeting at [[Marrakesh]], [[Morocco]], and hence is known as the [[Marrakesh Agreement]].<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.wto.org/english/docs_e/legal_e/04-wto_e.htm|title= Legal texts – Marrakesh agreement|publisher= WTO|access-date= 30 May 2010|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100525093037/http://www.wto.org/english/docs_e/legal_e/04-wto_e.htm|archive-date= 25 May 2010|url-status= live}}</ref>

The GATT still exists as the WTO's umbrella treaty for trade in goods, updated as a result of the Uruguay Round negotiations (a distinction is made between ''GATT 1994'', the updated parts of GATT, and ''GATT 1947'', the original agreement which is still the heart of GATT 1994).<ref name="G4" /> GATT 1994 is not, however, the only legally binding agreement included via the Final Act at Marrakesh; a long list of about 60 agreements, annexes, decisions and understandings was adopted. The agreements fall into six main parts:
* the Agreement Establishing the WTO
* the Multilateral Agreements on Trade in Goods<ref>including the GATT 1994 and the [[Trade Related Investment Measures]] (TRIMS)</ref>
* the [[General Agreement on Trade in Services]]
* the [[Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights]]

In terms of the WTO's [[WTO#Principles of the trading system|principle relating to tariff "ceiling-binding" (No. 3)]], the Uruguay Round has been successful in increasing binding commitments by both developed and developing countries, as may be seen in the percentages of tariffs bound before and after the 1986–1994 talks.<ref name="PT"/>

The Ministerial Conference can take decisions on all matters under any of the multilateral trade agreements.

The [[WTO Ministerial Conference of 2001|fourth ministerial conference]] in [[Doha]] in 2001 approved China's entry to the WTO and launched the [[Doha Development Round]] which was supplemented by the [[WTO Ministerial Conference of 2005|sixth WTO ministerial conference]] (in [[Hong Kong]]) which agreed to phase out agricultural export subsidies and to adopt the [[European Union]]'s [[Everything but Arms]] initiative to phase out tariffs for goods from the Least Developed Countries. At the sixth WTO Ministerial Conference of 2005 in December, WTO launched the [[Aid for Trade]] initiative and it is specifically to assist developing countries in [[trade]] as included in the [[Sustainable Development Goal 8]] which is to increase aid for trade support and economic growth.<ref>{{Cite web|title=WTO {{!}} Ministerial conferences - Hong Kong 6th Ministerial|url=https://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/minist_e/min05_e/min05_e.htm|access-date=2020-09-24|website=www.wto.org}}</ref>

==Functions==
Among the various functions of the WTO, these are regarded by analysts as the most important:
* It oversees the implementation, administration and operation of the covered agreements (with the exception is that it does not enforce any agreements when China came into the WTO in Dec 2001)<ref name="iisd-functions">[http://www.iisd.org/trade/handbook/3_2.htm Functions of the WTO] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927183405/http://www.iisd.org/trade/handbook/3_2.htm |date=27 September 2007 }}, IISD</ref><ref name="WTOmain-functions">[http://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/whatis_e/eol/e/wto01/wto1_11.htm Main Functions] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061230121730/http://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/whatis_e/eol/e/wto01/wto1_11.htm |date=30 December 2006 }}, WTO official site</ref>

The above five listings are the additional functions of the World Trade Organization. As globalization proceeds in today's society, the necessity of an [[International Organization]] to manage the trading systems has been of vital importance. As the trade volume increases, issues such as protectionism, trade barriers, subsidies, violation of intellectual property arise due to the differences in the trading rules of every nation. The World Trade Organization serves as the mediator between the nations when such problems arise. WTO could be referred to as the product of globalization and also as one of the most important organizations in today's globalized society.

The WTO is also a centre of economic research and analysis: regular assessments of the global trade picture in its annual publications and research reports on specific topics are produced by the organization.<ref name="EA">[http://www.wto.org/english/res_e/reser_e/reser_e.htm Economic research and analysis] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070315190051/http://www.wto.org/english/res_e/reser_e/reser_e.htm |date=15 March 2007 }}, WTO official site</ref> Finally, the WTO cooperates closely with the two other components of the Bretton Woods system, the IMF and the World Bank.<ref name="B17"/>

==Principles of the trading system== <!-- "WTO terms" redirects here. If changing this section name, please update that redirect. -->
The WTO establishes a framework for trade policies; it does not define or specify outcomes. That is, it is concerned with setting the rules of "trade policy". Five principles are of particular importance in understanding both the pre-1994 GATT and the WTO:
# '''Non-discrimination'''. It has two major components: the [[most favoured nation]] (MFN) rule, and the [[national treatment]] policy. Both are embedded in the main WTO rules on goods, services, and intellectual property, but their precise scope and nature differ across these areas. The MFN rule requires that a WTO member must apply the same conditions on all trade with other WTO members, i.e. a WTO member has to grant the most favourable conditions under which it allows trade in a certain product type to all other WTO members.<ref name="H42">B. Hoekman, ''The WTO: Functions and Basic Principles'', 42</ref> "Grant someone a special favour and you have to do the same for all other WTO members."<ref name="PT">[http://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/whatis_e/tif_e/fact2_e.htm#seebox Principles of the Trading System] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041211091642/http://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/whatis_e/tif_e/fact2_e.htm#seebox |date=11 December 2004 }}, WTO official site</ref> National treatment means that imported goods should be treated no less favourably than domestically produced goods (at least after the foreign goods have entered the market) and was introduced to tackle [[non-tariff barriers to trade]] (e.g. technical standards, security standards et al. discriminating against imported goods).<ref name="H42"/>
# '''Reciprocity'''. It reflects both a desire to limit the scope of [[Free rider problem|free-riding]] that may arise because of the MFN rule, and a desire to obtain better access to foreign markets. A related point is that for a nation to negotiate, it is necessary that the gain from doing so be greater than the gain available from [[unilateralism|unilateral]] liberalization; reciprocal concessions intend to ensure that such gains will materialise.<ref name="H43">B. Hoekman, ''The WTO: Functions and Basic Principles'', 43</ref>
# '''Binding and enforceable commitments'''. The [[tariff]] commitments made by WTO members in a multilateral trade negotiation and on accession are enumerated in a schedule (list) of concessions. These schedules establish "ceiling bindings": a country can change its bindings, but only after negotiating with its trading partners, which could mean compensating them for loss of trade. If satisfaction is not obtained, the complaining country may invoke the WTO dispute settlement procedures.<ref name="PT"/><ref name="H43"/>
# '''Transparency'''. The WTO members are required to publish their trade regulations, to maintain institutions allowing for the review of administrative decisions affecting trade, to respond to requests for information by other members, and to notify changes in trade policies to the WTO. These internal transparency requirements are supplemented and facilitated by periodic country-specific reports (trade policy reviews) through the [[Trade Policy Review Mechanism]] (TPRM).<ref name="H44">B. Hoekman, ''The WTO: Functions and Basic Principles'', 44</ref> The WTO system tries also to improve predictability and stability, discouraging the use of [[Import quota|quotas]] and other measures used to set limits on quantities of imports.<ref name="PT"/>
# '''Safety values'''. In specific circumstances, governments are able to [[Trade restriction|restrict trade]]. The WTO's agreements permit members to take measures to protect not only the environment but also public health, animal health and plant health.<ref name="wto.org">{{cite web|url=https://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/whatis_e/what_stand_for_e.htm|title=WTO – What is the WTO? – What we stand for|website=www.wto.org|access-date=28 March 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190606054009/https://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/whatis_e/what_stand_for_e.htm|archive-date=6 June 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Organizational structure==
The highest authority of the WTO is the Ministerial Conference, which must meet at least every two years.<ref name="whosewto">{{cite web |title=Whose WTO is it anyway? |url=https://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/whatis_e/tif_e/org1_e.htm |publisher=World Trade Organization |access-date=24 June 2020}}</ref>

In between of each Ministerial Conference, the daily work is handled by three bodies whose membership is one and the same; they only differ by the terms of reference under which each body is constituted.<ref name=whosewto/>
* The General Council
* The Dispute Settlement Body
* The Trade Policy Review Body

The General Council, whose Chair as of 2020 is [[David Walker (diplomat)|David Walker]] of New Zealand,<ref name=wtodg/> has the following subsidiary bodies which oversee committees in different areas:

;Council for Trade in Goods: There are 11 committees under the jurisdiction of the Goods Council each with a specific task. All members of the WTO participate in the committees. The Textiles Monitoring Body is separate from the other committees but still under the jurisdiction of Goods Council. The body has its own chairman and only 10 members.

==Decision-making==
The WTO describes itself as "a rules-based, member-driven organization—all decisions are made by the member governments, and the rules are the outcome of negotiations among members".<ref>[http://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/thewto_e.htm#decision_making Decision-making] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111111084450/http://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/thewto_e.htm#decision_making |date=11 November 2011 }} at WTO official site</ref> The WTO Agreement foresees votes where consensus cannot be reached, but the practice of consensus dominates the process of decision-making.<ref>[http://jiel.oxfordjournals.org/content/8/1/51.short Decision-Making in the World Trade Organization] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110825050917/http://jiel.oxfordjournals.org/content/8/1/51.short |date=25 August 2011 }} Abstract from ''Journal of International Economic Law'' at Oxford Journals</ref>

The priority is to settle disputes, preferably through a mutually agreed solution, and provision has been made for the process to be conducted in an efficient and timely manner so that "If a case is adjudicated, it should normally take no more than one year for a panel ruling and no more than 16 months if the case is appealed...

However, the dispute settlement system cannot be used to resolve trade disputes that arise from political disagreements. When Qatar requested the establishment of a dispute panel concerning measures imposed by the UAE, other GCC countries and the US were quick to dismiss its request as a political matter, stating that national security issues were political and not appropriate for the WTO dispute system.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ameinfo.com/money/economy/the-first-middle-east-victims-are-oil-exporters/|title=A US-less WTO: The first Middle East victims are oil exporters|website=ameinfo.com|language=en|access-date=5 September 2018|date=2 September 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180905180021/https://ameinfo.com/money/economy/the-first-middle-east-victims-are-oil-exporters/|archive-date=5 September 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Accession and membership==
{{Main|World Trade Organization accession and membership}}

The process of becoming a WTO member is unique to each applicant country, and the terms of accession are dependent upon the country's stage of economic development and current trade regime.<ref name="AS">[http://www.cid.harvard.edu/cidtrade/issues/accessions.html Accessions Summary] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070203051531/http://www.cid.harvard.edu/cidtrade/issues/accessions.html |date=3 February 2007 }}, Center for International Development</ref> The process takes about five years, on average, but it can last longer if the country is less than fully committed to the process or if political issues interfere. The shortest accession negotiation was that of the [[Kyrgyz Republic]], while the longest was that of Russia, which, having first applied to join GATT in 1993, was approved for membership in December 2011 and became a WTO member on 22 August 2012.<ref name=rusmem>[http://www.wto.org/english/news_e/news11_e/acc_rus_16dec11_e.htm Ministerial Conference approves Russia's WTO membership] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120107231725/http://wto.org/english/news_e/news11_e/acc_rus_16dec11_e.htm |date=7 January 2012 }} WTO News Item, 16 December 2011</ref> Kazakhstan also had a long accession negotiation process.

After a final meeting of the Working Party in October 2001, Vanuatu requested more time to consider its accession terms. In 2008, it indicated its interest to resume and conclude its WTO accession. The Working Party on the Accession of Vanuatu was reconvened informally on 4 April 2011 to discuss Vanuatu's future WTO membership. The re-convened Working Party completed its mandate on 2 May 2011. The General Council formally approved the Accession Package of Vanuatu on 26 October 2011. On 24 August 2012, the WTO welcomed Vanuatu as its 157th member.<ref>[http://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/acc_e/a1_vanuatu_e.htm Accession status: Vanuatu] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120811121430/http://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/acc_e/a1_vanuatu_e.htm |date=11 August 2012 }}.

A country wishing to accede to the WTO submits an application to the General Council, and has to describe all aspects of its trade and economic policies that have a bearing on WTO agreements.<ref name="BM">[http://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/whatis_e/tif_e/org3_e.htm#join Membership, Alliances and Bureaucracy] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070316000217/http://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/whatis_e/tif_e/org3_e.htm#join |date=16 March 2007 }}, WTO official site</ref> The application is submitted to the WTO in a [[memorandum]] which is examined by a working party open to all interested WTO Members.<ref name=autogenerated1>C. Michalopoulos, ''WTO Accession'', 62–63</ref>

After all necessary background information has been acquired, the working party focuses on issues of discrepancy between the WTO rules and the applicant's international and domestic trade policies and laws. The working party determines the terms and conditions of entry into the WTO for the applicant nation, and may consider transitional periods to allow countries some leeway in complying with the WTO rules.<ref name="AS"/>

The final phase of accession involves bilateral negotiations between the applicant nation and other working party members regarding the concessions and commitments on tariff levels and market access for goods and services. The new member's commitments are to apply equally to all WTO members under normal non-discrimination rules, even though they are negotiated bilaterally.<ref name="BM"/> For instance, as a result of joining the WTO, [[Armenia]] offered a 15 per cent ceiling [[bound tariff rate]] on accessing its market for goods. Together with the tariff bindings being [[ad valorem]] there are no specific or compound rates. Moreover, there are no [[tariff-rate quota]]s on both industrial and agricultural products.<ref>[http://www.wto.am/en/wto-membership Armenia – WTO] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190512153250/http://www.wto.am/en/wto-membership |date=12 May 2019 }}, www.wto.am</ref> Armenia's economic and trade performance growth was noted since its first review in 2010, especially its revival from the 2008 global financial crisis, with an average annual 4% GDP growth rate, despite of some fluctuations. [[Armenia]]'s economy was marked by low inflation, diminishing poverty and essential progress in enhancing its macroeconomic steadiness in which trade in goods and services, which is the equivalent of 87% of GDP, played a growing role.<ref>[https://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/tpr_e/tp479_crc_e.htm Concluding remarks by the Chairperson] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190512195924/https://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/tpr_e/tp479_crc_e.htm |date=12 May 2019 }}, WTO official site</ref>

When the bilateral talks conclude, the working party sends to the general council or ministerial conference an accession package, which includes a summary of all the working party meetings, the [[Protocol of Accession]] (a draft membership treaty), and lists ("schedules") of the member-to-be's commitments. Once the general council or ministerial conference approves of the terms of accession, the applicant's parliament must ratify the Protocol of Accession before it can become a member.<ref>[http://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/acc_e/acces_e.htm How to Become a Member of the WTO] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070313234319/http://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/acc_e/acces_e.htm |date=13 March 2007 }}, WTO official site</ref> Some countries may have faced tougher and a much longer accession process due to challenges during negotiations with other WTO members, such as Vietnam, whose negotiations took more than 11 years before it became official member in January 2007.<ref>{{cite book | last1 = Napier | first1 = Nancy K. | last2 = Vuong | first2 = Quan Hoang | title = What we see, why we worry, why we hope: Vietnam going forward | publisher = Boise State University CCI Press | year = 2013 | location = Boise, ID | page =140 | isbn = 978-0985530587}}</ref>

The [[Agreement on Agriculture]] came into effect with the establishment of the WTO at the beginning of 1995. The AoA has three central concepts, or "pillars": domestic support, [[market access]] and [[export subsidies]].

The [[General Agreement on Trade in Services]] was created to extend the multilateral trading system to [[tertiary sector of industry|service sector]], in the same way as the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) provided such a system for merchandise trade. The agreement entered into force in January 1995.

The [[Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights]] sets down minimum standards for many forms of intellectual property (IP) regulation. It was negotiated at the end of the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in 1994.<ref>[http://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/whatis_e/tif_e/agrm7_e.htm Understanding the WTO – Intellectual property: protection and enforcement] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130801061139/http://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/whatis_e/tif_e/agrm7_e.htm |date=1 August 2013 }}.

The [[Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures]]—also known as the SPS Agreement—was negotiated during the [[Uruguay Round]] of GATT, and entered into force with the establishment of the WTO at the beginning of 1995. Under the SPS agreement, the WTO sets constraints on members' policies relating to food safety (bacterial contaminants, pesticides, inspection and labelling) as well as animal and plant health (imported pests and diseases).

The [[Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade]] is an international [[treaty]] of the World Trade Organization. It was negotiated during the [[Uruguay Round]] of the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]], and entered into force with the establishment of the WTO at the end of 1994. The object ensures that technical negotiations and standards, as well as testing and certification procedures, do not create unnecessary obstacles to trade".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wto.org/english/docs_e/legal_e/ursum_e.htm#dAgreement|title=A Summary of the Final Act of the Uruguay Round|publisher=Wto.org|access-date=30 May 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100524205632/http://www.wto.org/english/docs_e/legal_e/ursum_e.htm#dAgreement|archive-date=24 May 2010|url-status=live}}</ref>

{{Main|Criticism of the World Trade Organization}}
Although tariffs and other trade barriers have been significantly reduced thanks to GATT and WTO, the promise that free trade will accelerate economic growth, reduce poverty, and increase people's incomes has been questioned by many critics.<ref name=":7">{{Cite book|last1=Joseph|first1=Sarah|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-U_1KMg6GkgC|title=Blame it on the WTO?: A Human Rights Critique|last2=Joseph|first2=Sarah Louise|date=14 April 2011|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-956589-4|pages=164–167|language=en}}</ref> Some prominent skeptics{{Who|date=July 2020}} cite the example of [[El Salvador]]. In the early 1990s, they removed all quantitative barriers to imports and also cut tariffs. However, the country's economic growth remained weak. On the other hand, [[Vietnam]] which only began reforming its economy in the late 1980s, saw a great deal of success by deciding to follow the [[Chinese economic reform|China's economic model]] and liberalizing slowly along with implementing safeguards for domestic commerce. Vietnam has largely succeeded in accelerating economic growth and reducing poverty without immediately removing substantial trade barriers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://dev.wcfia.harvard.edu/sites/default/files/Rodrick_HowToSave.pdf|date=8 February 2016|page=14|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160208100820/http://dev.wcfia.harvard.edu/sites/default/files/Rodrick_HowToSave.pdf|archive-date=8 February 2016|access-date=19 May 2020}}</ref><ref name=":7" />

Economist Ha-Joon Chang himself argues that there is a "paradox" in neo-liberal beliefs regarding free trade, because the economic growth of developing countries was higher in the 1960–1980 period compared to the 1980–2000 period even though its trade policies are now far more liberal than before. In addition, there are also results of research that show that new countries actively reduce trade barriers only after becoming significantly rich. From the results of the study, WTO critics argue that trade liberalization does not guarantee economic growth and certainly not poverty alleviation.<ref name=":7" />

Critics also put forward the view that the benefits derived from WTO facilitated free trade are not shared equally.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Wilkinson |first1=Rorden |title=What's wrong with the WTO and how to fix it |date=2014 |publisher=Polity |location=Cambridge, UK |isbn=978-0-745-67245-8 |url=https://www.wiley.com/en-us/What%27s+Wrong+with+the+WTO+and+How+to+Fix+It-p-9780745672458}}</ref> This criticism is usually supported by historical accounts of the outcomes of negotiations and/or data showing that the gap between the rich and the poor continues to widen, especially in [[China]] and [[India]], where economic inequality is growing even though economic growth is very high.<ref name=":7" /> In addition, WTO approaches aiming to reduce trade barriers can harm developing countries. Trade liberalization that is too early without any prominent domestic barriers is feared to trap the developing economies in the primary sector, which often does not require skilled labor. And when these developing countries decide to advance their economy by means of industrialization, the premature domestic industry cannot immediately skyrocket as expected, making it difficult to compete with other countries whose industries are more advanced.<ref name=":8">{{Cite book|last1=Joseph|first1=Sarah|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-U_1KMg6GkgC|title=Blame it on the WTO?: A Human Rights Critique|last2=Joseph|first2=Sarah Louise|date=14 April 2011|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-956589-4|pages=171–174|language=en}}</ref>

According to a 2017 study in the ''Journal of International Economic Law'', "nearly all recent [preferential trade agreements (PTAs) reference the WTO explicitly, often dozens of times across multiple chapters. Likewise, in many of these same PTAs we find that substantial portions of treaty language—sometime the majority of a chapter—is copied verbatim from a WTO agreement... the presence of the WTO in PTAs has increased over time."<ref name=":6">{{Cite journal|last1=Allee|first1=Todd|last2=Elsig|first2=Manfred|last3=Lugg|first3=Andrew|date=2017|title=The Ties between the World Trade Organization and Preferential Trade Agreements: A Textual Analysis|journal=Journal of International Economic Law|language=en|volume=20|issue=2|pages=333–363|doi=10.1093/jiel/jgx009|issn=1369-3034}}</ref>
