'''Léo Apotheker''' (born September 18, 1953, in [[Aachen]]) is a [[Germany|German]] [[business executive]]. He served briefly as the chief executive officer of [[Hewlett-Packard]] from November 2010 until his firing in September 2011.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://money.cnn.com/2011/09/22/technology/hp_ceo_fired/index.htm | work=CNN | title=HP CEO Apotheker fired, replaced by Meg Whitman | date=September 22, 2011}}</ref>  He also served as co-chief executive officer of [[SAP AG|SAP]] from April 2008 until he resigned in February 2010 following a decision by that company not to renew his contract.<ref>http://www.spiegel.de/international/business/sap-founder-hasso-plattner-it-was-a-shock-that-something-like-this-could-happen-a-677851.html</ref>

During his tenure as chief executive at HP, the company lost more than $30 billion in market capitalization after a series of strategic missteps by the company, leading to his resignation.<ref>{{cite news|title=Hewlett-Packard replaces Leo Apotheker with Meg Whitman|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-15028509|accessdate=22 September 2011|newspaper=BBC News|date=2011-09-22}}</ref>  At SAP, which he joined in 1988 and where he spent more than twenty years, he played an instrumental role in developing and implementing a number of significant changes.<ref name=bloomb/>

Apotheker currently sits on the board of KMD, Schneider Electric SA, Steria, and PlaNet Finance - a non-profit organization. He previously served on the Board of Directors of [[GT Nexus]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Léo Apotheker Joins GT Nexus Board of Directors |url=http://www.gtnexus.com/leo-apotheker-joins-gt-nexus-board-of-directors/ |accessdate=19 June 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130830032556/http://www.gtnexus.com/leo-apotheker-joins-gt-nexus-board-of-directors/ |archive-date=30 August 2013 }}</ref> Apotheker is fluent in five languages—German, Dutch, French, English and Hebrew.<ref name=bloomb/>

==Early life and education==
Apotheker's parents were [[Polish Jews]] who fled to the [[Soviet-Chinese border]] after the [[invasion of Poland|Nazis invaded Poland]] at the outbreak of [[World War II]].<ref name=econom>{{Cite news |url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/babbage/2010/10/hewlett_packard_names_former_sap_boss_apotheker_ceo |title=The Léo Way |author=L.S. and M.G. |date=2010-10-01 |publisher=The Economist |accessdate=1 October 2010}}</ref> After the war, they settled in [[Aachen]], [[Germany]], where Léo Apotheker was born on September 18, 1953. He later moved to [[Antwerp]], [[Belgium]].<ref name=econom/>

By his own account, he organized a student strike in high school, and had two of his teeth knocked out by a policeman on horseback in the melee that followed.<ref name=bloomb>{{Cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-10-01/hewlett-packard-names-apotheker-ceo-adding-software-expertise.html |title=Hewlett-Packard Names Leo Apotheker CEO |author=Aaron Ricadela |date=2010-10-01 |publisher=Bloomberg |accessdate=1 October 2010}}</ref> At the age of 18 he moved to [[Israel]] where he studied economics at the [[Hebrew University]] in [[Jerusalem]].<ref name=bloomb/>

==Career==

===Early career and SAP: 1988–2010===
Prior to joining SAP in 1988, Apotheker held several financial and operations positions at European companies.<ref name=bloomb/>

After joining SAP, he held positions of increasing responsibility; and in 1995 was promoted to CEO and founder of SAP France and SAP Belgium. Later in 1997, he became the president of SAP's South West Europe region; and by 1999, president of SAP EMEA (Europe, Middle East, and Africa) sales region.

He joined the SAP AG executive board in 2002, and served as the president of global customer solutions{{what|date=September 2019}} and operations from 2002 to 2007. He was appointed deputy CEO in 2007; and promoted to co-CEO of the company in April 2008 to ensure a smooth [[handover]] from his predecessor, [[Henning Kagermann]], when the latter's contract with the company expired. The succession plan was communicated in the business media early in 2008, including ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.forbes.com/afxnewslimited/feeds/afx/2008/04/02/afx4844726.html |title=SAP names Leo Apotheker as co-CEO |date=2008-04-02 |accessdate=2010-09-30 |work=[[Forbes]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110622002148/http://www.forbes.com/feeds/afx/2008/04/02/afx4844726.html|archive-date=2011-06-22 }}</ref> The transition received praise as an example of SAP's corporate culture, "a seemingly contradictory mix of internal consensus and competition".<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.economist.com/node/12850403 |publisher=The Economist |title=The Other Transition  |accessdate=2010-09-30 |date=2009-01-03 |volume=390 |issue=8612 |page=49}}</ref>

Apotheker's appointment to lead SAP was the second occasion, after 1997 [[Ron Sommer]]'s appointment as CEO of [[Deutsche Telekom]], that a large German company was run by a Jewish executive whose parents escaped the Holocaust. “If SAP had a pre-war history, I would never have joined the company,” he told ''[[The Economist]]''.<ref>[https://www.economist.com/node/12850403 The Economist (December 30 2008)].</ref>

Apotheker took an early opportunity to set out his vision for the IT industry, and explained [[enterprise software]] in layman's terms (likening it to the human nervous system), in an interview with prominent American journalist [[Charlie Rose]].<ref>[http://www.charlierose.com/view/interview/9901 Charlie Rose Show (January 6 2009)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090122021858/http://www.charlierose.com/view/interview/9901 |date=January 22, 2009 }}.</ref> He also articulated SAP's commitment to [[sustainability]].<ref>[http://www.vnunet.com/vnunet/news/2230230/sap-wants-feedback-csr VNUnet.com (November 11 2008)]{{dead link|date=July 2014}}.</ref>

On February 7, 2010, the SAP supervisory board reached an agreement with Apotheker not to extend his contract as a member of the SAP executive board. With this decision, he stepped down as CEO and resigned from SAP.

===Hewlett-Packard: 2010–2011===
On September 30, 2010, the Board of Directors of [[Hewlett-Packard]] announced the election of Apotheker as the company's Chief Executive Officer and President, effective November 1.<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20101004140440/http://www.marketwatch.com/story/leo-apotheker-named-ceo-and-president-of-hp-2010-09-30</ref> He succeeded [[Cathie Lesjak]], who served as the company's interim CEO since August 6, following the abrupt departure of former CEO [[Mark Hurd]]. Hurd had been forced to resign after an internal investigation into a sexual harassment claim (that found him not guilty) uncovered expense-account irregularities.<ref name=Huffington1>{{cite news|work=[[Huffington Post]]|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/08/06/hp-ceo-mark-hurd-resigns-_n_673858.html|author=Jordan Robertson and Rachel Metz|date=2010-08-06|title=HP CEO Mark Hurd Resigns After Sexual-Harassment Probe}}</ref>

During Apotheker's tenure at HP the stock dropped about 40%. It dropped nearly 25% on 19 August 2011, after HP announced a number of seemingly abrupt strategic decisions: to discontinue its [[webOS]] device business (mobile phones and tablet computers), to begin planning to divest its personal computer division, and to acquire British software firm [[Autonomy Corporation|Autonomy]] for a significant premium.<ref>{{cite web|title=HPQ stock since naming Leo Apotheker CEO.|url=http://investing.money.msn.com/investments/equity-charts?symbol=US%3aHPQ|access-date=2014-07-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140728102337/http://investing.money.msn.com/investments/equity-charts?symbol=US%3aHPQ|archive-date=2014-07-28|url-status=dead}}</ref>  Over the months following Apotheker's departure, HP eventually spun off the remaining webOS assets into a new subsidiary, [[Palm, Inc.|Gram]]; backtracked on any plans to spin-off its personal computer division; and wrote-down almost $9 billion related to the Autonomy acquisition, which it indicated was due to a lack of due diligence during the acquisition process under Apotheker.<ref>[https://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/11/20/hp_alleges_autonomy_fraud/]</ref>

On September 22, 2011, the HP Board of Directors replaced Apotheker as chief executive, effective immediately, with fellow board member and former [[eBay]] chief [[Meg Whitman]].<ref>{{cite web|title=HP names Meg Whitman as CEO|url=http://www.marketwatch.com/story/h-p-names-meg-whitman-as-ceo-2011-09-22?reflink=MW_news_stmp}}</ref> Though Apotheker served barely ten months, he received over $13 million in compensation: a severance payment of $7.2 million, shares worth $3.56 million, and a performance bonus of $2.4 million,<ref>[http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/new-hewlett-packard-chief-meg-whitman-chief-gets-1-salary-ex-boss-leo-apotheker-gets-13m/story-e6frg6n6-1226153567931 New Hewlett-Packard chief Meg Whitman gets $1 salary, Leo Apotheker gets $13m], The Australian, sept. 30 2011</ref> although the company lost more than $30 billion in market capitalization during his tenure.

===After HP: 2011 to present===
After HP, Apotheker returned to Paris. He, along with some private equity firms in [[Silicon Valley]], are considering to invest in mature and distressed companies. In March 2012, he appeared on a conference call, hosted by [[Nomura Securities]] analyst Rick Sherlund.<ref name=LA-C-10>http://gigaom.com/2012/03/01/is-leo-apotheker-launching-a-comeback/</ref>

On June 1, 2012, he was appointed as an independent director to board of the Paris-based information technology services provider, [[Steria]].<ref>{{cite web|title=The arrival of Leo Apotheker and Laetitia Puyfaucher will strengthen Steria's supervisory board|url=http://www.steria.com/media/press-releases/press-releases/article/the-arrival-of-leo-apotheker-and-laetitia-puyfaucher-will-strengthen-sterias-supervisory-board/|publisher=[[Steria]]|accessdate=24 July 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120705191758/http://www.steria.com/media/press-releases/press-releases/article/the-arrival-of-leo-apotheker-and-laetitia-puyfaucher-will-strengthen-sterias-supervisory-board/|archive-date=5 July 2012}}</ref>

He currently sits on the [[supervisory board]]s of [[Schneider Electric]] SA, Steria, and [[GT Nexus]]. He is also a board member of PlaNet Finance - a non-profit organization.

In December 2012, he was appointed Chairman of the board at [[KMD (company)|KMD]], a Danish information technology service provider.<ref>[https://archive.today/20130212205025/http://www.kmd.dk/da/presse/pressemeddelelser_og_nyheder/Pages/KMD-sale-finalised-%E2%80%93-new-board-announcement.aspx]</ref>

In 2014, he joined [http://www.unit4.com UNIT4] - a Dutch software provider, headquartered in the Netherlands - as Non-Executive Chairman of the Board.<ref>http://www.unit4.com/about/management-team/</ref>

In May 2016, he joined [http://www.signavio.com Signavio GmbH] - a German software provider, headquartered in Berlin - as Non-Executive Chairman of the company's Advisory Board.<ref>http://www.signavio.com/news/leo-apotheker-joins-signavio/</ref>
