The '''Space Race''' was a 20th-century competition between two [[Cold War]] rivals, the [[Soviet Union]] (USSR) and the [[United States]] (US), to achieve firsts in [[spaceflight]] capability. It had its origins in the [[ballistic missile]]-based [[nuclear arms race]] between the two nations following [[World War&nbsp;II]]. The technological advantage required to rapidly achieve spaceflight milestones was seen as necessary for [[national security]], and mixed with the symbolism and ideology of the time. The Space Race led to pioneering efforts to launch [[artificial satellite]]s, uncrewed [[space probe]]s of the [[Moon]], [[Venus]], and [[Mars]], and [[human spaceflight]] in [[low Earth orbit]] and to the Moon.<ref>[https://www.history.com/topics/cold-war/space-race history.com, Space Race]</ref>

The competition began in earnest on August 2, 1955, when the Soviet Union responded to the US announcement four days earlier of intent to launch artificial satellites for the [[International Geophysical Year]], by declaring they would also launch a satellite "in the near future". The Soviet Union achieved the first successful launch with the October 4, 1957, orbiting of ''[[Sputnik 1]]'', and sent the first human to space with the orbital flight of [[Yuri Gagarin]] on April 12, 1961. The USSR also sent the first woman, [[Valentina Tereshkova]], to space on June 16, 1963, with numerous other firsts taking place over the next few years with regards to flight duration, spacewalks and related activities. According to Russian sources, these achievements led to the conclusion that the USSR had an advantage in space technology in the early 1960s.<ref>[https://www.history.com/news/from-sputnik-to-spacewalking-7-soviet-space-firsts history.com, From Sputnik to Spacewalking: 7 Soviet Space Firsts, Oct 4, 2012]</ref>

According to US sources, the "race" peaked with the July 20, 1969, US landing of the first humans on the Moon with [[Apollo 11]]. Most US sources will point to the Apollo 11 lunar landing as a singular achievement far outweighing any combination of Soviet achievements. The USSR attempted several [[Soviet crewed lunar programs|crewed lunar missions]], but eventually canceled them and concentrated on Earth orbital space stations, while the US landed several more times on the Moon.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraft/display.action?id=1969-059A|title=Apollo 11 Command and Service Module (CSM)|website=NASA Space Science Data Coordinated Archive|access-date=November 20, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraft/display.action?id=1969-059C|title=Apollo 11 Lunar Module / EASEP|website=NASA Space Science Data Coordinated Archive|access-date=November 20, 2019}}</ref><ref name="orbit">{{cite web |url=https://airandspace.si.edu/explore-and-learn/topics/apollo/apollo-program/landing-missions/apollo11.cfm |title=Apollo 11 Mission Summary |website=Smithsonian Air and Space Museum}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/lunar/lunar_sites.html |title=Apollo Landing Site Coordinates |publisher=NASA|work=NASA Space Science Data Coordinated Archive |first=David R. |last=Williams |date=December 11, 2003 |accessdate=September 7, 2013}}</ref>

A period of [[détente]] followed with the April 1972 agreement on a co-operative [[Apollo–Soyuz]], resulting in the July 1975 rendezvous in Earth orbit of a US astronaut crew with a Soviet cosmonaut crew and co-developing the enabling docking standard [[APAS-75]]. Though cooperation had been pursued since the very beginning of the [[Space Age]], Apollo–Soyuz eased the competition to enable later cooperation.<ref name = technology>{{cite report|url= https://www.princeton.edu/~ota/disk2/1985/8533/8533.PDF |pages=80–81 |publisher=US Congress, Office of Technology Assessment|title=U.S.-Soviet Cooperation in Space |date=July 1985 |accessdate=June 13, 2018}}</ref> The end of the Space Race and competition is not clear cut, since the Apollo 11 Moon landing and the ASTP have been identified as such,<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K751AwAAQBAJ&pg=PT747|title=Encyclopedia of United States National Security |isbn=978-0-7619-2927-7 |publisher=[[Sage Publications]] |editor-first=Richard J. |editor-last=Samuels |editor-link=Richard J.

==Early rocket development==

===Germany during World War II===
[[File:Wernher von Braun.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Wernher von Braun]] (1912–1977), technical director of [[Nazi Germany]]'s missile program, became the United States' lead rocket engineer during the 1950s and 1960s]]
The origins of the Space Race can be traced to Germany, beginning in the 1930s and continuing during [[World War&nbsp;II]] when [[Nazi Germany]] researched and built operational [[ballistic missiles]] capable of [[sub-orbital spaceflight]].<ref>{{cite book|title=The Rocket and the Reich: Peenemünde and the Coming of the Ballistic Missile Era|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780029228951|url-access=registration|last=Neufeld|first=Michael J|publisher=The Free Press|year=1995|isbn=|location=New York|pages=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780029228951/page/158 158], 160–62, 190}}</ref> Starting in the early 1930s, during the last stages of the [[Weimar Republic]], German [[aerospace engineer]]s experimented with liquid-fueled [[rocket]]s, with the goal that one day they would be capable of reaching high altitudes and traversing long distances.<ref>Cornwell (2003), p. 147</ref> The head of the German Army's Ballistics and Munitions Branch, Lieutenant Colonel [[Karl Heinrich Emil Becker|Karl Emil Becker]], gathered a small team of engineers that included [[Walter Dornberger]] and Leo Zanssen, to figure out how to use rockets as long-range [[artillery]] in order to get around the [[Treaty of Versailles]]' ban on research and development of long-range [[cannon]]s.<ref>Cornwell (2004), p. 146</ref> [[Wernher von Braun]], a young engineering prodigy, was recruited by Becker and Dornberger to join their secret army program at [[Kummersdorf|Kummersdorf-West]] in 1932.<ref>Cornwell (2003), p. 148</ref> Von Braun dreamed of conquering outer space with rockets and did not initially see the military value in missile technology.<ref>Cornwell (2003), p. 150</ref>

During the Second World War, General Dornberger was the military head of the army's rocket program, Zanssen became the commandant of the [[Peenemünde]] army rocket center, and von Braun was the technical director of the [[ballistic missile]] program.<ref>Burrows (1998), p. 96</ref> They led the team that built the [[Aggregat (rocket family)#A4 (V-2 rocket)|Aggregat-4 (A-4) rocket]], which became the first vehicle to reach [[outer space]] during its test flight program in 1942 and 1943.<ref>Burrows (1998), pp. 99–100</ref> By 1943, Germany began mass-producing the A-4 as the [[V-2 rocket|Vergeltungswaffe 2]] ("Vengeance Weapon" 2, or more commonly, V2), a ballistic missile with a {{convert|320|km|mi|sp=us}} range carrying a {{convert|1130|kg|lb|sp=us}} [[warhead]] at {{convert|4000|km/h|mi/h||sp=us}}.<ref>Burrows (1998), pp. 98–99</ref> Its supersonic speed meant there was no defense against it, and [[radar]] detection provided little warning.<ref>Stocker (2004), pp. 12–24</ref> Germany used the weapon to bombard southern England and parts of Allied-liberated western Europe from 1944 until 1945.<ref>Gainor (2001), p. 68</ref> After the war, the V-2 became the basis of early American and Soviet rocket designs.<ref name="Schefter29">Schefter (1999), p. 29</ref><ref>Siddiqi (2003a), p. 41</ref>

At war's end, American, British, and Soviet scientific intelligence teams competed to capture Germany's rocket engineers along with the German rockets themselves and the designs on which they were based.<ref>Siddiqi (2003a), p.&nbsp;24–41</ref> Each of the Allies captured a share of the available members of the German rocket team, but the United States benefited the most with [[Operation Paperclip]], recruiting von Braun and most of his engineering team, who later helped develop the American missile and space exploration programs. The United States also acquired a large number of complete V2 rockets.<ref name="Schefter29"/>

The German rocket center in Peenemünde was located in the eastern part of Germany, which became the [[Soviet zone of occupation]]. On Stalin's orders, the Soviet Union sent its best rocket engineers to this region to see what they could salvage for future weapons systems.<ref name="Siddiqi24-34">Siddiqi (2003a), pp. 24–34</ref> The Soviet rocket engineers were led by [[Sergei Korolev]].<ref name="Siddiqi24-34"/> He had been involved in space clubs and early Soviet rocket design in the 1930s, but was arrested in 1938 during [[Joseph Stalin]]'s [[Great Purge]] and imprisoned for six years in Gulag.<ref>Siddiqi (2003a), pp. 4, 11, 16</ref> After the war, he became the USSR's chief rocket and spacecraft engineer, essentially the Soviet counterpart to von Braun.<ref name="schefter7-10">Schefter (1999), pp. 7–10</ref> His identity was kept a [[Classified information|state secret]] throughout the Cold War, and he was identified publicly only as "the Chief Designer."<ref name="schefter7-10"/> In the West, his name was only officially revealed when he died in 1966.<ref name="schefter7-10"/>

After almost a year in the area around Peenemünde, Soviet officials conducted [[Operation Osoaviakhim]] and later moved more than 170 of the top captured German rocket specialists to [[Gorodomlya Island]] on [[Lake Seliger]], about {{convert|240|km|mi|sp=us}} northwest of Moscow.<ref name="siddiqi45">Siddiqi (2003a), p. 45</ref> They were not allowed to participate in final Soviet missile design, but were used as problem-solving consultants to the Soviet engineers.<ref name="Gatland 100-01"/> They helped in the following areas: the creation of a Soviet version of the A-4; work on "organizational schemes"; research in improving the A-4 main engine; development of a 100-ton engine; assistance in the "layout" of plant production rooms; and preparation of rocket assembly using German components.<ref name="siddiqi45"/> With their help, particularly [[Helmut Gröttrup]]'s group, Korolev [[Reverse engineering|reverse-engineered]] the A-4 and built his own version of the rocket, the [[R-1 (missile)|R-1]], in 1948.<ref name="Gröttrup">{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.astronautix.com/lvfam/earsiles.htm|title=Early Russian Ballistic Missiles |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Astronautix |last=Wade |first=Mark |accessdate=July 24, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061016145847/http://www.astronautix.com/lvfam/earsiles.htm |archivedate=October 16, 2006 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Later, he developed his own distinct designs, though many of these designs were influenced by the Gröttrup Group's G4-R14 design from 1949.<ref name="Gröttrup"/> The Germans were eventually repatriated in 1952–53.<ref name="Gröttrup"/> Details of the German achievements and potential contributions to the Soviet rocket and space program were evaluated after their return from Gorodomlya.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP80-00810A003300530005-2.pdf|title=Development of guided missiles at Bleicherode and Institut 88|website=CIA Historical Collection|date=January 22, 1954|access-date=September 4, 2019|quote=Besides this love for rocket technique, there exists a second mental consideration which affects Soviet decisions, and that is respect for work in the West, especially German work.

===American rocket development===
The American professor [[Robert H. Goddard]] had worked on developing [[solid-propellant rocket]]s since 1914, and demonstrated a light battlefield rocket to the [[Signal Corps (United States Army)|US Army Signal Corps]] only five days before the signing of the [[First Armistice at Compiègne|armistice that ended World War I]]. He also started developing [[liquid-propellant rocket]]s in 1921, yet he had not been taken seriously by the public.<ref>Goddard's 1919 research paper ''A Method of Reaching Extreme Altitudes'' was famously ridiculed in a ''New York Times'' editorial.</ref>

Von Braun and his team were sent to the United States Army's [[White Sands Missile Range|White Sands Proving Ground]], located in [[New Mexico]], in 1945.<ref>Burrows (1998), p. 123</ref> They set about assembling the captured V2s and began a program of launching them and instructing American engineers in their operation.<ref name="Burroughs129-134">Burrows (1998), pp. 129–34</ref> These tests led to the [[first photos of Earth from space]], and the first two-stage rocket, the [[WAC Corporal]]-V2 combination, in 1949.<ref name="Burroughs129-134"/> The German rocket team was moved from [[Fort Bliss]] to the Army's new [[Redstone Arsenal]], located in [[Huntsville, Alabama]], in 1950.<ref name="Burroughs137">Burrows (1998), p. 137</ref> From here, von Braun and his team developed the Army's first operational medium-range ballistic missile, the [[PGM-11 Redstone|Redstone rocket]], that in slightly modified versions, launched both America's first satellite, and the first piloted Mercury space missions.<ref name="Burroughs137"/> It became the basis for both the [[Jupiter-C|Jupiter]] and [[Saturn (rocket family)|Saturn family of rockets]].<ref name="Burroughs137"/>

===Cold War missile race===

If [[Konstantin Tsiolkovsky|Tsiolkovsky]], [[Hermann Oberth|Oberth]], [[Robert H.

Burrows, ''This New Ocean'', "The Other World Series", p. 147 |align = right |width = 35% |border = 3px |fontsize = |bgcolor = #CCCCCC }}

The [[Cold War]] (1947–1991) developed between two former allies, the Soviet Union and the United States, soon after the end of the Second World War. It involved a continuing state of political conflict, military tension, proxy wars, and economic competition, primarily between the Soviet Union and its [[satellite state]]s (often referred to as the [[Eastern Bloc]]) and the powers of the [[Western world]], particularly the United States.<ref name = "Schmitz">Schmitz, (1999), pp. 149–54</ref> The primary participants' military forces never clashed directly, but expressed this conflict through military coalitions, strategic conventional force deployments, extensive aid to states deemed vulnerable, proxy wars, espionage, propaganda, a nuclear arms race, and economic and technological competitions, such as the Space Race.<ref name = "Schmitz" />

In simple terms, the Cold War could be viewed as an expression of the ideological struggle between communism and capitalism.<ref name="Burroughs147-49">Burrows (2012), pp. 147–49</ref> The United States faced a new uncertainty beginning in September 1949, when it lost its monopoly on the [[Nuclear weapon|atomic bomb]].<ref name="Burroughs147-49" /> American intelligence agencies discovered that the Soviet Union had exploded its first atomic bomb, with the consequence that the United States potentially could face a future nuclear war that, for the first time, might devastate its cities.<ref name="Burroughs147-49"/> Given this new danger, the United States participated in an arms race with the Soviet Union that included development of the [[Teller–Ulam design|hydrogen bomb]], as well as intercontinental [[strategic bomber]]s and intercontinental ballistic missiles ([[ICBM]]s) capable of delivering nuclear weapons.<ref name="Burroughs147-49"/> A new fear of communism and its sympathizers swept the United States during the 1950s, which devolved into paranoid [[McCarthyism]].<ref name="Burroughs147-49"/> With communism spreading in China, Korea, and Eastern Europe, Americans came to feel so threatened that popular and political culture condoned extensive "[[witch-hunt]]s" to expose communist spies.<ref name="Burroughs147-49"/> Part of the American reaction to the Soviet atomic and hydrogen bomb tests included maintaining a large [[United States Air Force|Air Force]], under the control of the [[Strategic Air Command]] (SAC). SAC employed intercontinental strategic bombers, as well as medium-bombers based close to Soviet airspace (in western Europe and in [[Turkey]]) that were capable of delivering nuclear payloads.<ref name="Polmar&Laur">Polmer and Laur (1990), pp. 229–41</ref>

For its part, the Soviet Union harbored fears of invasion. Having suffered at least 27 million casualties during World War II after being invaded by Nazi Germany in 1941,<ref name=Burroughs149-51>Burrows (1998), pp. 149–51</ref> the Soviet Union was wary of its former ally, the United States, which until late 1949 was the sole possessor of atomic weapons. The United States had used these weapons operationally during World War II, and it could use them again against the Soviet Union, laying waste to its cities and military centers.<ref name=Burroughs149-51/> Since the Americans had a much larger air force than the Soviet Union, and the United States maintained advance air bases near Soviet territory, in 1947 Stalin ordered the development of [[intercontinental ballistic missile]]s (ICBMs) in order to counter the perceived American threat.<ref name="Gatland 100-01">Gatland (1976), pp. 100–01</ref>

[[File:Roket_Launcher_R-7.svg|thumb|Soviet R-7 [[intercontinental ballistic missile|ICBM]], and [[R-7 (rocket family)|its derivative launch vehicles]] for Sputnik, Vostok, Voskhod, and Soyuz]]

In 1953, Korolev was given the go-ahead to develop the [[R-7 Semyorka]] rocket, which represented a major advance from the German design. Although some of its components (notably boosters) still resembled the German G-4, the new rocket incorporated staged design, a completely new control system, and a new fuel. It was successfully tested on August 21, 1957, and became the world's first fully operational ICBM the following month.<ref>Hall & Shayler (2001), p. 56</ref> It was later used to launch the first satellite into space, and [[R-7 (rocket family)|derivatives]] launched all piloted Soviet spacecraft.<ref>Siddiqi (2003a), pp. 468–69</ref>

The United States had multiple rocket programs divided among the different branches of the American armed services, which meant that each force developed its own ICBM program. The Air Force initiated ICBM research in 1945 with the [[MX-774]].<ref name="Atlas">{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.astronautix.com/a/index.html |title= Atlas |encyclopedia= Encyclopedia Astronautix |last= Wade|first= Mark|accessdate=September 28, 2020}}</ref> However, its funding was cancelled and only three partially successful launches were conducted in 1947.<ref name="Atlas"/> In 1950, von Braun began testing the Air Force [[PGM-11 Redstone]] rocket family at Cape Canaveral.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Man on the Moon: The U.S. Space Program as a Cold War Maneuver|jstor = 25162945|journal = OAH Magazine of History|date = January 1, 1994|pages = 42–50|volume = 8|issue = 2|first = Rita G.|last = Koman|doi = 10.1093/maghis/8.2.42}}</ref> In 1951, the Air Force began a new ICBM program called MX-1593, and by 1955 this program was receiving top-priority funding.<ref name="Atlas"/> The MX-1593 program evolved to become the [[SM-65 Atlas|Atlas-A]], with its maiden launch occurring June 11, 1957, becoming the first successful American ICBM.<ref name="Atlas"/> Its upgraded version, the [[SM-65 Atlas|Atlas-D]] rocket, later served as a nuclear ICBM and as the orbital launch vehicle for [[Project Mercury]] and the remote-controlled [[Agena Target Vehicle]] used in [[Project Gemini]].<ref name="Atlas"/>

With the Cold War as an engine for change in the ideological competition between the United States and the Soviet Union, a coherent space policy began to take shape in the United States during the late 1950s.<ref>Burrows (1998), p. 138</ref> Korolev took inspiration from the competition as well, achieving many firsts to counter the possibility that the United States might prevail.<ref name="Siddiqia">Siddiqi (2003a), p. 383</ref>

===First artificial satellite===
In 1955, with both the United States and the Soviet Union building ballistic missiles that could be utilized to launch objects into space, the stage was set for nationalistic competition.<ref name="Schefter3-5">Schefter (1999), pp. 3–5</ref> In separate announcements four days apart, both nations publicly announced that they would launch artificial Earth satellites by 1957 or 1958.<ref name="Schefter3-5"/> On July 29, 1955, [[James C. Hagerty]], President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]'s press secretary, announced that the United States intended to launch "small Earth circling satellites" between July 1, 1957, and December 31, 1958, as part of the US contribution to the [[International Geophysical Year]] (IGY).<ref name="Schefter3-5"/> Four days later, at the [[International Astronautical Federation|Sixth Congress of International Astronautical Federation]] in Copenhagen, scientist [[Leonid I. Sedov]] spoke to international reporters at the Soviet embassy and announced his country's intention to launch a satellite as well, in the "near future".<ref name="Schefter3-5"/> On August 30, 1955, Korolev managed to get the [[Soviet Academy of Sciences]] to create a commission whose purpose was to beat the Americans into Earth orbit: this was the ''de facto'' start date for the Space Race.<ref name="Schefter3-5"/> The [[Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union]] began a policy of treating development of its space program as [[classified information]].

Initially, President Eisenhower was worried that a satellite passing above a nation at over {{convert|100|km|mi|sp=us}} might be construed as violating that nation's sovereign airspace.<ref name="Schefter8">Schefter (1999), p. 8</ref> He was concerned that the Soviet Union would accuse the Americans of an illegal overflight, thereby scoring a propaganda victory at his expense.<ref>Schefter (1999), p. 6</ref> Eisenhower and his advisors were of the opinion that a nation's airspace sovereignty did not extend past the [[Kármán line]], and they used the 1957–58 International Geophysical Year launches to establish this principle in international law.<ref name="Schefter8"/> Eisenhower also feared that he might cause an international incident and be called a "warmonger" if he were to use military missiles as launchers. Therefore, he selected the untried [[Naval Research Laboratory]]'s [[Vanguard rocket]], which was a research-only booster.<ref name="Schefter15-18">Schefter (1999), pp. 15–18</ref> This meant that von Braun's team was not allowed to put a satellite into orbit with their Jupiter-C rocket, because of its intended use as a future military vehicle.<ref name="Schefter15-18"/> On September 20, 1956, von Braun and his team did launch a Jupiter-C that was capable of putting a satellite into orbit, but the launch was used only as a suborbital test of reentry vehicle technology.<ref name="Schefter15-18"/>

Korolev received word about von Braun's 1956 Jupiter-C test and, mistakenly thinking it was a satellite mission that failed, expedited plans to get his own satellite in orbit.

On April 2, 1958, President Eisenhower reacted to the Soviet space lead in launching the first satellite by recommending to the US Congress that a civilian agency be established to direct nonmilitary space activities. Congress, led by [[Party Leaders of the United States Senate|Senate Majority Leader]] [[Lyndon B. Johnson]], responded by passing the [[National Aeronautics and Space Act]], which Eisenhower signed into law on July 29, 1958. This law turned the [[National Advisory Committee on Aeronautics]] into the [[NASA|National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] (NASA). It also created a Civilian-Military Liaison Committee, appointed by the President, responsible for coordinating the nation's civilian and military space programs.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4201/ch4-6.htm |title=Birth of NASA |website=history.nasa.gov |accessdate=2020-02-12}}</ref>

On October 21, 1959, Eisenhower approved the transfer of the Army's remaining space-related activities to NASA. On July 1, 1960, the Redstone Arsenal became NASA's [[Marshall Space Flight Center|George C. Marshall Space Flight Center]], with von Braun as its first director. Development of the [[Saturn (rocket family)|Saturn rocket family]], which when mature gave the US parity with the Soviets in terms of lifting capability, was thus transferred to NASA.{{citation_needed|date=July 2019}}

In 1958, Korolev upgraded the R-7 to be able to launch a {{convert|400|kg|lb|adj=on}} payload to the Moon. Three secret{{Fact|date=April 2020}} 1958 attempts to launch [[Luna E-1 No.1|Luna E-1]]-class [[Lander (spacecraft)#Impactors|impactor]] probes failed. The fourth attempt, [[Luna 1]], launched successfully on January 2, 1959, but missed the Moon. The fifth attempt on June 18 also failed at launch. The {{convert|390|kg|lb|adj=on}} [[Luna 2]] successfully impacted the Moon on September 14, 1959.

The US reacted to the [[Luna programme|Luna program]] by embarking on the [[Ranger program]] in 1959, managed by NASA's [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]]. The Block I [[Ranger 1]] and [[Ranger 2]] suffered [[Atlas-Agena]] launch failures in August and November 1961.

When the FAI filing for [[Gherman Titov]]'s second Vostok flight in August 1961 disclosed the ejection landing technique, the FAI committee decided to investigate, and concluded that the technological accomplishment of human spaceflight lay in the safe launch, orbiting, and return, rather than the manner of landing, and revised their rules, keeping Gagarin's and Titov's records intact.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.nasm.si.edu/space/why-yuri-gagarin-remains-the-first-man-in-space-even-though-he-did-not-land-inside-his-spacecraft/|title=Why Yuri Gagarin Remains the First Man in Space, Even Though He Did Not Land Inside His Spacecraft|date=April 12, 2010|publisher=}}</ref>

==First American in space==
[[File:Alan Shepard during Mercury-Redstone 3.jpg|thumb|right|Alan Shepard, the first American in space, 1961]]
The US Air Force had been developing a program to launch the first man in space, named [[Man in Space Soonest]]. This program studied several different types of one-man space vehicles, settling on a [[space capsule|ballistic re-entry capsule]] launched on a derivative [[Atlas LV-3B|Atlas missile]], and selecting a group of nine candidate pilots. After NASA's creation, the program was transferred over to the civilian agency and renamed [[Project Mercury]] on November 26, 1958. NASA selected a new group of [[astronaut]] (from the Greek for "star sailor") candidates from [[United States Navy|Navy]], [[United States Air Force|Air Force]] and [[United States Marine Corps|Marine]] test pilots, and narrowed this down to [[Mercury Seven|a group of seven]] for the program. Capsule design and astronaut training began immediately, working toward preliminary suborbital flights on the [[Mercury-Redstone Launch Vehicle|Redstone missile]], followed by orbital flights on the Atlas. Each flight series would first start uncrewed, then carry a non-human primate, then finally humans.{{citation_needed|date=July 2019}}

... if we are to win the battle that is now going on around the world between freedom and tyranny, the dramatic achievements in space which occurred in recent weeks should have made clear to us all, as did the Sputnik in 1957, the impact of this adventure on the minds of men everywhere, who are attempting to make a determination of which road they should take. ...

... Recognizing the head start obtained by the Soviets with their large rocket engines, which gives them many months of lead-time, and recognizing the likelihood that they will exploit this lead for some time to come in still more impressive successes, we nevertheless are required to make new efforts on our own.

... I believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal, before this decade is out, of landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to the Earth. No single space project in this period will be more impressive to mankind, or more important for the long-range exploration of space, and none will be so difficult or expensive to accomplish.

Before Gagarin's flight, US President [[John F. Kennedy#Space policy|John F. Kennedy]]'s support for America's crewed space program was lukewarm. [[Jerome Wiesner]] of MIT, who served as a science advisor to presidents Eisenhower and Kennedy, and himself an opponent of crewed space exploration, remarked, "If Kennedy could have opted out of a big space program without hurting the country in his judgment, he would have."<ref>Quoted in John M. Logsdon, ''The Decision to Go to the Moon: Project Apollo and the National Interest'' (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1970) p. 111.</ref> As late as March 1961, when NASA administrator James E. Webb submitted a budget request to fund a Moon landing before 1970, Kennedy rejected it because it was simply too expensive.<ref>[[David E. Bell]], Memorandum for the President, "National Aeronautics and Space Administration Budget Problem," March 22, 1961, NASA Historical Reference Collection; U.S. Congress, House, Committee of Science and Astronautics, ''NASA Fiscal 1962 Authorization'', ''Hearings'', 87th Cong., 1st. sess., 1962, pp. 203, 620; Logsdon, Decision to go to the Moon, pp. 94–100.</ref> Some were surprised by Kennedy's eventual support of NASA and the space program because of how often he had attacked the Eisenhower administration's inefficiency during the election.<ref>Wolfe, Tom. The Right Stuff. New York: Picador, 1979.(179)</ref>

Gagarin's flight changed this; now Kennedy sensed the humiliation and fear on the part of the American public over the Soviet lead. Additionally, the [[Bay of Pigs invasion]], planned before his term began but executed during it, was an embarrassment to his administration due to the colossal failure of the US forces.<ref>Roger D. Launius and Howard E. McCurdy, eds, Spaceflight and the Myth of Presidential Leadership (Champaign, IL: University of Illinois Press, 1997), 56.</ref> Looking for something to save political face, he sent a memo dated April 20, 1961, to Vice President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]], asking him to look into the state of America's space program, and into programs that could offer [[NASA]] the opportunity to catch up.<ref>Kennedy to Johnson,[http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/Apollomon/apollo1.pdf "Memorandum for Vice President,"] April 20, 1961.</ref> The two major options at the time were either the establishment of an Earth orbital space station or a crewed landing on the Moon. Johnson, in turn, consulted with von Braun, who answered Kennedy's questions based on his estimates of US and Soviet rocket lifting capability.<ref>von Braun to Johnson,[http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/Apollomon/apollo3.pdf Untitled], April 29, 1961.</ref> Based on this, Johnson responded to Kennedy, concluding that much more was needed to reach a position of leadership, and recommending that the crewed Moon landing was far enough in the future that the US had a fighting chance to achieve it first.<ref name="lbjmemo">Johnson to Kennedy,[http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/Apollomon/apollo2.pdf "Evaluation of Space Program,"] April 28, 1961.</ref>

Kennedy ultimately decided to pursue what became the [[Apollo program]], and on May 25 took the opportunity to ask for Congressional support in a Cold War speech titled "Special Message on Urgent National Needs". {{Cws |title=Full text |link=Special Message to the Congress on Urgent National Needs|nobullet=yes}}

On February 23, 1962, President Kennedy escorted him in a parade at [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station]], where he awarded Glenn with the NASA service medal.{{citation_needed|date=July 2019}}

The United States launched three more Mercury flights after Glenn's: ''[[Aurora 7]]'' on May 24, 1962 duplicated Glenn's three orbits, ''[[Mercury-Atlas 8|Sigma 7]]'' on October 3, 1962 six orbits, and ''[[Faith 7]]'' on May 15, 1963 22 orbits (32.4 hours), the maximum capability of the spacecraft. NASA at first intended to launch one more mission, extending the spacecraft's endurance to three days, but since this would not beat the Soviet record, it was decided instead to concentrate on developing [[Project Gemini]].{{citation_needed|date=July 2019}}

===Vostok===
[[File:Vostok spacecraft replica.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Replica of the Vostok capsule]]
[[Gherman Titov]] became the first Soviet cosmonaut to exercise manual control of his [[Vostok 2]] craft on August 6, 1961.<ref>Gatland (1976), pp. 115–16</ref> The Soviet Union demonstrated 24-hour launch pad turnaround and the capability to launch two piloted spacecraft, [[Vostok 3]] and [[Vostok 4]], in essentially identical orbits, on August 11 and 12, 1962.<ref>Hall (2001), pp. 183, 192</ref> The two spacecraft came within approximately {{convert|6.5|km|mi|sp=us}} of one another, close enough for radio communication.<ref>Gatland (1976), pp. 117–18</ref> Vostok 4 also set a record of nearly four days in space. Though the two craft's orbits were as nearly identical as possible given the accuracy of the launch rocket's guidance system, slight variations still existed which drew the two craft at first as close to each other as {{convert|6.5|km|nmi|sp=us|abbr=off}}, then as far apart as {{convert|2850|km|nmi|sp=us|abbr=off}}. There were no maneuvering rockets on the Vostok to permit [[space rendezvous]], required to keep two spacecraft a controlled distance apart.<ref>Hall (2001), pp. 185–91</ref>
[[File:RIAN archive 15491 Valery B.jpg|thumb|upright|Valentina Tereshkova]]
The Soviet Union duplicated its dual-launch feat with [[Vostok 5]] and [[Vostok 6]] (June 16, 1963). This time they launched the first woman (also the first civilian), [[Valentina Tereshkova]], into space on Vostok 6.<ref name="Hall194-218">Hall(2001), pp. 194–218</ref> Launching a woman was reportedly Korolev's idea, and it was accomplished purely for propaganda value.<ref name="Hall194-218"/> Tereshkova was one of a small corps of female cosmonauts who were amateur parachutists, but Tereshkova was the only one to fly.<ref name="Hall194-218"/> The USSR didn't again open its cosmonaut corps to women until 1980, two years after the United States opened its astronaut corps to women.

The Soviets kept the details and true appearance of the Vostok capsule secret until the April 1965 Moscow Economic Exhibition, where it was first displayed without its aerodynamic nose cone concealing the spherical capsule. The "Vostok spaceship" had been first displayed at the July 1961 [[Soviet air show|Tushino air show]], mounted on its launch vehicle's third stage, with the nose cone in place. A tail section with eight fins was also added, in an apparent attempt to confuse western observers. This spurious tail section also appeared on official commemorative stamps and a documentary.<ref>Gatland (1976), p. 254</ref>

==Kennedy proposes a joint US-USSR program==
After a first US-USSR [[Dryden-Blagonravov agreement]] and cooperation on the [[Project Echo|Echo II balloon satellite]] in 1962,<ref name = technology/> President Kennedy proposed on September 20, 1963, in a speech before the [[United Nations General Assembly]], that the United States and the Soviet Union join forces in an effort to reach the Moon. Kennedy thus changed his mind regarding the desirability of the space race, preferring instead to ease tensions with the Soviet Union by cooperating on projects such as a joint lunar landing.<ref>Stone, Oliver and Peter Kuznick, "The Untold History of the United States" (Gallery Books, 2012), p. 320</ref>  Soviet Premier [[Nikita Khrushchev]] initially rejected Kennedy's proposal.<ref name="spacedaily">{{cite web|last=Sietzen|first=Frank|title=Soviets Planned to Accept JFK's Joint Lunar Mission Offer|url=http://www.spacedaily.com/news/russia-97h.html|work="SpaceCast News Service" Washington DC|date=October 2, 1997 |accessdate=February 1, 2011}}</ref> However, on October 2, 1997, it was reported that Khrushchev's son [[Sergei Khrushchev|Sergei]] claimed Khrushchev was poised to accept Kennedy's proposal at the time of [[assassination of John F.

During the next few weeks he reportedly concluded that both nations might realize cost benefits and technological gains from a joint venture, and decided to accept Kennedy's offer based on a measure of rapport during their years as leaders of the world's two superpowers, but changed his mind and dropped the idea since he did not have the same trust for Kennedy's successor, Lyndon Johnson.<ref name="spacedaily" />

As President, Johnson steadfastly pursued the Gemini and Apollo programs, promoting them as Kennedy's legacy to the American public. One week after Kennedy's death, he issued an executive order renaming the Cape Canaveral and [[Kennedy Space Center|Apollo launch]] facilities after Kennedy.{{citation_needed|date=July 2019}}

==Gemini and Voskhod==
Focused by the commitment to a Moon landing, in January 1962 the US announced [[Project Gemini]], a two-person spacecraft that would support the later three-person Apollo by developing the key spaceflight technologies of [[space rendezvous]] and docking of two craft, flight durations of sufficient length to simulate going to the Moon and back, and [[extra-vehicular activity]] to accomplish useful work outside the spacecraft.<ref>{{cite web

Meanwhile, Korolev had planned further, long-term missions for the Vostok spacecraft, and had four Vostoks in various stages of fabrication in late 1963 at his [[S.P. Korolev Rocket and Space Corporation Energia|OKB-1]] facilities.<ref name="Siddiqi 384-6">Siddiqi (2003a), pp. 384–86</ref> At that time, the Americans announced their ambitious plans for the Project Gemini flight schedule.

===Voskhod program===

The greater advances of the Soviet space program at the time allowed their space program to achieve other significant firsts, including the first ever "spacewalk". Gemini took a year longer than planned to accomplish its first flight, allowing the Soviets to achieve another first, launching the first spacecraft with a three-cosmonaut crew, [[Voskhod 1]], on October 12, 1964.<ref>{{cite news

By October 16, 1964, [[Leonid Brezhnev]] and a small cadre of high-ranking Communist Party officials deposed Khrushchev as Soviet government leader a day after Voskhod 1 landed, in what was called the "Wednesday conspiracy".<ref>{{cite news

The new political leaders, along with Korolev, ended the technologically troublesome Voskhod program, cancelling Voskhod 3 and 4, which were in the planning stages, and started concentrating on reaching the Moon.<ref>Siddiqi (2003a), pp. 510–11</ref> Voskhod 2 ended up being Korolev's final achievement before his death on January 14, 1966, as it became the last of the many space firsts that demonstrated the USSR's domination in spacecraft technology during the early 1960s.

[[File:Gemini 7 in orbit - GPN-2006-000035.jpg|thumb|Rendezvous of Gemini 6 and 7, December 1965]]
Though delayed a year to reach its first flight, Gemini was able to take advantage of the USSR's two-year hiatus after Voskhod, which enabled the US to catch up and surpass the previous Soviet lead in piloted spaceflight. Gemini achieved several significant firsts during the course of ten piloted missions:
* On [[Gemini 3]] (March 1965), astronauts [[Virgil I. Grissom|Virgil "Gus" Grissom]] and [[John Young (astronaut)|John W. Young]] became the first to demonstrate their ability to change their craft's orbit.
* On [[Gemini 4]] (June 1965), [[Ed White (astronaut)|Ed White]] performed the first US spacewalk.
* On [[Gemini 5]] (August 1965), astronauts [[Gordon Cooper|L. Gordon Cooper]] and [[Pete Conrad|Charles "Pete" Conrad]] set a record of almost eight days in space, long enough for a piloted lunar mission.
* On [[Gemini 6A]] (December 1965), Command Pilot [[Wally Schirra]] achieved the first [[space rendezvous]] with [[Gemini 7]], accurately matching his orbit to that of the other craft, [[orbital station-keeping|station-keeping]] for three consecutive orbits at distances as close as {{convert|1|ft|m|sp=us}}.<ref>{{cite web

* Gemini 7 also set a human spaceflight endurance record of fourteen days for [[Frank Borman]] and [[Jim Lovell|James A. Lovell]], which stood until both nations started launching space laboratories in the early 1970s.
* On [[Gemini 8]] (March 1966), Command Pilot [[Neil Armstrong]] achieved the first docking between two spacecraft, his Gemini craft and an [[Agena target vehicle]].
* [[Gemini 11]] (September 1966), commanded by Conrad, achieved the first direct-ascent rendezvous with its Agena target on the first orbit, and used the Agena's rocket to achieve an [[apogee]] of {{convert|742|nmi|km|sp=us}}, the crewed Earth orbit record still current as of 2015.
* On [[Gemini 12]] (November 1966), [[Edwin Aldrin|Edwin "Buzz" Aldrin]] spent over five hours working comfortably during three (EVA) sessions, finally proving that humans could perform productive tasks outside their spacecraft.

Most of the novice pilots on the early missions would command the later missions. In this way, Project Gemini built up spaceflight experience for the pool of astronauts for the Apollo lunar missions.

Korolev's design bureau produced two prospectuses for circumlunar spaceflight (March 1962 and May 1963), the main spacecraft for which were early versions of his Soyuz design. Soviet Communist Party Central Committee Command 655-268 officially established two secret, competing crewed programs for circumlunar flights and lunar landings, on August 3, 1964. The circumlunar flights were planned to occur in 1967, and the landings to start in 1968.<ref name="MirHeritage">Portree, Part 1–1.2 Historical Overview</ref>

The circumlunar program (Zond), created by [[Vladimir Chelomey]]'s design bureau [[OKB-52]], was to fly two cosmonauts in a stripped-down [[Soyuz 7K-L1]], launched by Chelomey's [[Proton (rocket)|Proton UR-500]] rocket. The Zond sacrificed habitable cabin volume for equipment, by omitting the Soyuz orbital module. Chelomey gained favor with Khrushchev by employing members of his family.

Korolev's lunar landing program was designated N1/L3, for its [[N1 (rocket)|N1 super rocket]] and a more advanced [[Soyuz 7K-LOK|Soyuz 7K-L3]] spacecraft, also known as the lunar orbital module ("''Lunniy Orbitalny Korabl''", LOK), with a crew of two. A separate lunar lander ("''Lunniy Korabl''", [[LK (spacecraft)|LK]]), would carry a single cosmonaut to the lunar surface.<ref name="MirHeritage"/>

The N1/L3 launch vehicle had three stages to Earth orbit, a fourth stage for Earth departure, and a fifth stage for lunar landing assist. The combined space vehicle was roughly the same height and takeoff mass as the three-stage US [[Apollo spacecraft|Apollo/]] [[Saturn V]] and exceeded its takeoff thrust by 28%, but had only roughly half the [[translunar injection]] payload capability.{{citation_needed|date=July 2019}}

Following Khrushchev's ouster from power, Chelomey's Zond program was merged into the N1/L3 program.{{citation_needed|date=July 2019}}

On May 10, 1962, Vice President Johnson addressed the Second National Conference on the Peaceful Uses of Space revealing that the United States and the USSR both supported a resolution passed by the Political Committee of the UN General Assembly in December 1962, which not only urged member nations to "extend the rules of international law to outer space," but to also cooperate in its exploration. Following the passing of this resolution, Kennedy commenced his communications proposing a cooperative American/Soviet space program.<ref>[http://www.jfklibrary.org/Asset-Viewer/Archives/JFKNSF-308-006.aspx Papers of John F. Kennedy. Presidential Papers. National Security Files. Subjects. Space activities: US/USSR cooperation, 1961–96]</ref>

The UN ultimately created a ''[[Outer Space Treaty|Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies]]'', which was signed by the United States, USSR, and the [[United Kingdom]] on January 27, 1967, and went into force the following October 10.{{citation_needed|date=July 2019}}

{{Wikisource|Outer Space Treaty of 1967}}
This treaty:
* bars party States from placing [[weapons of mass destruction]] in Earth orbit, on the Moon, or any other celestial body;
* exclusively limits the use of the Moon and other celestial bodies to peaceful purposes, and expressly prohibits their use for testing weapons of any kind, conducting military maneuvers, or establishing military bases, installations, and fortifications;
* declares that the exploration of outer space shall be done to benefit all countries and shall be free for exploration and use by all the States;
* explicitly forbids any government from claiming a celestial resource such as the Moon or a planet, claiming that they are the [[common heritage of mankind]], "not subject to national appropriation by claim of sovereignty, by means of use or occupation, or by any other means". However, the State that launches a space object retains jurisdiction and control over that object;
* holds any State liable for damages caused by their space object;
* declares that "the activities of non-governmental entities in outer space, including the Moon and other celestial bodies, shall require authorization and continuing supervision by the appropriate State Party to the Treaty", and "States Parties shall bear international responsibility for national space activities whether carried out by governmental or non-governmental entities"; and
* "A State Party to the Treaty which has reason to believe that an activity or experiment planned by another State Party in outer space, including the Moon and other celestial bodies, would cause potentially harmful interference with activities in the peaceful exploration and use of outer space, including the Moon and other celestial bodies, may request consultation concerning the activity or experiment."

The treaty remains in force, signed by 107 member states. – {{As of|July 2017}}

==Disaster strikes both sides==
In 1967, both nations faced serious challenges that brought their programs to temporary halts. Both had been rushing at full-speed toward the first piloted flights of Apollo and Soyuz, without paying due diligence to growing design and manufacturing problems. The results proved fatal to both pioneering crews.

[[File:Apollo 1 fire.jpg|thumb|left|Charred interior of the Apollo 1 spacecraft after the fire that killed the first crew]]
On January 27, 1967, the same day the US and USSR signed the Outer Space Treaty, the crew of the [[Apollo 1|first crewed Apollo mission]], Command Pilot [[Gus Grissom|Virgil "Gus" Grissom]], Senior Pilot [[Ed White (astronaut)|Ed White]], and Pilot [[Roger Chaffee]], were killed in a fire that swept through their spacecraft cabin during a ground test, less than a month before the planned February 21 launch. An investigative board determined the fire was probably caused by an electrical spark and quickly grew out of control, fed by the spacecraft's pure oxygen atmosphere. Crew escape was made impossible by inability to open the [[plug door]] hatch cover against the greater-than-atmospheric internal pressure.<ref name="sea5"/> The board also found design and construction flaws in the spacecraft, and procedural failings, including failure to appreciate the hazard of the pure-oxygen atmosphere, as well as inadequate safety procedures.<ref name="sea5"/> All these flaws had to be corrected over the next twenty-two months until the first piloted flight could be made.<ref name="sea5">{{cite book|first=Robert C., Jr. |last=Seamans|publisher=NASA History Office|title=Report of Apollo 204 Review Board |chapter=Findings, Determinations And Recommendations|chapter-url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/pao/History/Apollo204/find.html|date=April 5, 1967 |accessdate=October 7, 2007}}</ref>

On April 24, 1967, the single pilot of [[Soyuz 1]], [[Vladimir Mikhaylovich Komarov|Vladimir Komarov]], became the first in-flight spaceflight fatality. The mission was planned to be a three-day test, to include the first Soviet docking with an unpiloted [[Soyuz 2]], but the mission was plagued with problems. Early on, Komarov's craft lacked sufficient electrical power because only one of two [[solar panels on spacecraft|solar panels]] had deployed. Then the automatic [[attitude control system]] began malfunctioning and eventually failed completely, resulting in the craft spinning wildly. Komarov was able to stop the spin with the manual system, which was only partially effective. The flight controllers aborted his mission after only one day. During the emergency re-entry, a fault in the landing parachute system caused the primary chute to fail, and the reserve chute became tangled with the drogue chute, causing descent speed to reach as high as 40&nbsp;m/s (140&nbsp;km/h; 89&nbsp;mph). Shortly thereafter, [[Soyuz 1]] impacted the ground 3&nbsp;km (1.9&nbsp;mi) west of Karabutak, exploding into a ball of flames. The official autopsy states Komarov died of blunt force trauma on impact, and that the subsequent heat mutilation of his corpse was a result of the explosive impact. Fixing the spacecraft's faults caused an eighteen-month delay before piloted Soyuz flights could resume.{{citation_needed|date=July 2019}}

==Onward to the Moon==
The United States recovered from the Apollo 1 fire, fixing the fatal flaws in an improved version of the [[Apollo Command/Service Module#Major differences between Block I and Block II|Block II command module]]. The US proceeded with unpiloted test launches of the [[Saturn V]] launch vehicle ([[Apollo 4]] and [[Apollo 6]]) and the [[Apollo Lunar Module|Lunar Module]] ([[Apollo 5]]) during the latter half of 1967 and early 1968.<ref>Cadbury (2006), pp. 310–12, 314–16</ref> Apollo 1's mission to check out the [[Apollo Command/Service Module]] in Earth orbit was accomplished by Grissom's backup crew commanded by [[Wally Schirra|Walter Schirra]] on [[Apollo 7]], launched on October 11, 1968.<ref>Burrows (1999), p. 417</ref> The eleven-day mission was a total success, as the spacecraft performed a virtually flawless mission, paving the way for the United States to continue with its lunar mission schedule.<ref>Murray (1990), pp. 323–24</ref>

During the summer of 1968, the Apollo program hit another snag: the first pilot-rated Lunar Module (LM) was not ready for orbital tests in time for a December 1968 launch. NASA planners overcame this challenge by changing the mission flight order, delaying the first LM flight until March 1969, and sending [[Apollo 8]] into lunar orbit without the LM in December.<ref>Kraft (2001), pp. 284–97</ref> This mission was in part motivated by intelligence rumors the Soviet Union might be ready for a piloted Zond flight during late 1968.<ref>Chaikin (1994), pp. 57–58</ref> In September 1968, [[Zond 5]] made a circumlunar flight with [[tortoises]] on board and returned safely to Earth, accomplishing the first successful water landing of the Soviet space program in the Indian Ocean.<ref>Siddiqi (2003b), pp. 654–56</ref> It also scared NASA planners, as it took them several days to figure out that it was only an automated flight, not piloted, because voice recordings were transmitted from the craft en route to the Moon.<ref>Turnhill (2003), p. 134</ref> On November 10, 1968, another automated test flight, [[Zond 6]], was launched.

On December 21, 1968, [[Frank Borman]], [[Jim Lovell|James Lovell]], and [[William Anders]] became the first humans to ride the [[Saturn V]] rocket into space, on Apollo 8. They also became the first to leave low-Earth orbit and go to another celestial body, entering lunar orbit on December 24.<ref name="Poole19-34">Poole (2008), pp. 19–34</ref> They made ten orbits in twenty hours, and transmitted one of the most watched TV broadcasts in history, with their [[Apollo 8 Genesis reading|Christmas Eve program]] from lunar orbit, which concluded with a reading from the biblical [[Book of Genesis]].<ref name="Poole19-34"/> Two and a half hours after the broadcast, they fired their engine to perform the first [[trans-Earth injection]] to leave lunar orbit and return to the Earth.<ref name="Poole19-34"/> Apollo 8 safely landed in the Pacific Ocean on December 27, in NASA's first dawn splashdown and recovery.<ref name="Poole19-34"/>

The American Lunar Module was finally ready for a successful piloted test flight in low Earth orbit on [[Apollo 9]] in March 1969. The next mission, [[Apollo 10]], conducted a "dress rehearsal" for the first landing in May 1969, flying the LM in lunar orbit as close as {{convert|47400|ft|km}} above the surface, the point where the powered descent to the surface would begin.<ref name="chariots12-7">{{cite book|last1=Brooks|first1=Courtney G. |last2=Grimwood |first2=James M. |last3=Swenson |first3=Loyd S., Jr. |others=Foreword by [[Samuel C.

==Competition winds down==
[[File:Apollo 17 The Last Moon Shot Edit1.jpg|thumb|right|Apollo 17's Saturn V in 1972]]
[[File:Apollo 17 Cernan on moon.jpg|thumb|right|Moonwalk, December 13, 1972]]
NASA had ambitious follow-on human spaceflight plans as it reached its lunar goal, but soon discovered it had expended most of its political capital to do so.<ref>Hepplewhite, p. 186</ref>

The first landing was followed by another, precision landing on [[Apollo 12]] in November 1969. NASA had achieved its first landing goal with enough Apollo spacecraft and Saturn V launchers left for eight follow-on lunar landings through Apollo 20, conducting extended-endurance missions and transporting the landing crews in [[Lunar Roving Vehicle]]s on the last five. They also planned an [[Apollo Applications Program]] to develop a longer-duration Earth orbital workshop (later named [[Skylab]]) to be constructed in orbit from a spent [[S-IVB]] upper stage, using several launches of the smaller [[Saturn IB]] launch vehicle. But planners soon decided this could be done more efficiently by using the two live stages of a Saturn V to launch the workshop pre-fabricated from an S-IVB (which was also the Saturn V third stage), which immediately removed Apollo 20. Budget cuts soon led NASA to cut Apollo 18 and 19 as well, but keep three extended/Lunar Rover missions. [[Apollo 13]] encountered an in-flight spacecraft failure and had to abort its lunar landing in April 1970, returning its crew safely but temporarily grounding the program again. It resumed with four successful landings on [[Apollo 14]] (February 1971), [[Apollo 15]] (July 1971), [[Apollo 16]] (April 1972), and [[Apollo 17]] (December 1972).

In February 1969, President [[Richard M. Nixon]] convened a [[National Space Council|Space Task Group]] to set recommendations for the future US civilian space program, headed by his Vice President [[Spiro T. Agnew]].<ref>Hepplewhite, p. 123</ref> Agnew was an enthusiastic proponent of NASA's follow-on plans, and the STG recommended plans to develop a reusable [[Space Transportation System]] including a [[Space Shuttle]], which would facilitate development of permanent [[space station]]s in Earth and lunar orbit, perhaps a base on the lunar surface, and the first human flight to Mars as early as 1986 or as late as 2000.<ref>Hepplewhite, pp. 136–50</ref> Nixon had a better sense of the declining political support in Congress for a new Apollo-style program, which had disappeared with the achievement of the landing, and he intended to pursue detente with the USSR and China, which he hoped might ease Cold War tensions. He cut the spending proposal he sent to Congress to include funding for only the Space Shuttle, with perhaps an option to pursue the Earth orbital space station for the foreseeable future.<ref>Hepplewhite, pp. 150–77</ref>

The USSR continued trying to perfect their N1 rocket, finally canceling it in 1976, after two more launch failures in 1971 and 1972.<ref>Portree, 1.2.4 Manned Lunar Program (1964–1976)</ref>

===Salyuts and Skylab===
[[File:The Soviet Union 1971 CPA 4060 stamp (Cosmonauts Georgy Dobrovolsky, Vladislav Volkov and Viktor Patsayev).jpg|thumb|right|The Soyuz 11 crew with the Salyut station in the background, in a Soviet commemorative stamp]]
Having lost the race to the Moon, the USSR decided to concentrate on orbital space stations. During 1969 and 1970, they launched six more Soyuz flights after Soyuz 3, then launched the first [[space station]], the [[Salyut 1]] laboratory designed by [[Kerim Kerimov]], on April 19, 1971. <!-- The dimensions, habitable volume and mass of the Salyuts don't seem to be readily available, but should go here.--> Three days later, the [[Soyuz 10]] crew attempted to dock with it, but failed to achieve a secure enough connection to safely enter the station. The [[Soyuz 11]] crew of [[Vladislav Volkov]], [[Georgi Dobrovolski]] and [[Viktor Patsayev]] successfully docked on June 7, and completed a record 22-day stay. The crew became the second in-flight space fatality during their reentry on June 30. They were [[asphyxiated]] when their spacecraft's cabin lost all pressure, shortly after undocking. The disaster was blamed on a faulty cabin pressure valve, that allowed all the air to vent into space. The crew was not wearing pressure suits and had no chance of survival once the leak occurred.{{citation_needed|date=July 2019}}

Salyut 1's orbit was increased to prevent premature reentry, but further piloted flights were delayed while the Soyuz was redesigned to fix the new safety problem. The station re-entered the Earth's atmosphere on October 11, after 175 days in orbit. The USSR attempted to launch a second Salyut-class station designated Durable Orbital Station-2 (DOS-2) on July 29, 1972, but a rocket failure caused it to fail to achieve orbit. After the DOS-2 failure, the USSR attempted to launch four more Salyut-class stations up to 1975, with another failure due to an explosion of the final rocket stage, which punctured the station with shrapnel so that it would not hold pressure. All of the Salyuts were presented to the public as non-military scientific laboratories, but some of them were covers for the military [[Almaz]] reconnaissance stations.{{citation_needed|date=July 2019}}

The United States launched the orbital workstation [[Skylab]] 1 on May 14, 1973. It weighed {{convert|169950|lb|kg}}, was {{convert|58|ft|m|sp=us}} long by {{convert|21.7|ft|m|sp=us}} in diameter, and had a habitable volume of {{convert|10000|ft3|m3|sp=us}}. Skylab was damaged during the ascent to orbit, losing one of its solar panels and a meteoroid thermal shield. Subsequent crewed missions repaired the station, and the final mission's crew, [[Skylab 4]], set a human endurance record with 84 days in orbit when the mission ended on February 8, 1974. Skylab stayed in orbit another five years before reentering the Earth's atmosphere over the Indian Ocean and Western Australia on July 11, 1979.{{citation_needed|date=July 2019}}

===Apollo–Soyuz Test Project===
{{Main|Apollo-Soyuz Test Project}}
[[File:Portrait of ASTP crews - restoration.jpg|thumb|left|alt= the five crew members of ASTP sitting around a miniature model of their spacecraft|Apollo-Soyuz crew: From left to right: [[Deke Slayton|Donald "Deke" Slayton]], [[Thomas Patten Stafford]], [[Vance Brand]], [[Alexei Leonov]], and [[Valeri Kubasov]]]]
In May 1972, President [[Richard M. Nixon]] and Soviet [[Premier of the Soviet Union|Premier]] [[Leonid Brezhnev]] negotiated an easing of relations known as [[detente]], creating a temporary "thaw" in the Cold War. The time seemed right for cooperation rather than competition, and the notion of a continuing "race" began to subside.{{citation_needed|date=July 2019}}

The two nations planned a joint mission to dock the last US Apollo craft with a Soyuz, known as the [[Apollo-Soyuz Test Project]] (ASTP). To prepare, the US designed a docking module for the Apollo that was compatible with the Soviet docking system, which allowed any of their craft to dock with any other (e.g. Soyuz/Soyuz as well as Soyuz/Salyut). The module was also necessary as an airlock to allow the men to visit each other's craft, which had incompatible cabin atmospheres. The USSR used the [[Soyuz 16]] mission in December 1974 to prepare for ASTP.{{citation_needed|date=July 2019}}

The joint mission began when [[Soyuz 19]] was first launched on July 15, 1975, at 12:20 [[UTC]], and the Apollo craft was launched with the docking module six and a half hours later. The two craft rendezvoused and docked on July 17 at 16:19 [[UTC]]. The three astronauts conducted joint experiments with the two cosmonauts, and the crew shook hands, exchanged gifts, and visited each other's craft.{{citation_needed|date=July 2019}}

===Human spaceflight after Apollo===
[[File:International Space Station after undocking of STS-132.jpg|thumb|International Space Station in 2010]]
In the 1970s, the United States began developing the reusable orbital [[Space Shuttle]] [[spaceplane]], and launched a range of uncrewed probes. The USSR continued to develop space station technology with the [[Salyut program]] and [[Mir]] ('Peace' or 'World', depending on the context) space station, supported by Soyuz spacecraft. They developed their own large spaceplane under the [[Buran program]]. The USSR [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|dissolved in 1991]] and the remains of its space program mainly passed to Russia. The United States and Russia have worked together in space with the [[Shuttle–Mir Program]], and again with the [[International Space Station]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.txstate-epdc.net/international-cooperation-on-the-iss/|title=International Cooperation on the ISS|date=November 1, 2019|website=Texas State University|language=en-US|access-date=January 15, 2020}}</ref>

The Russian [[R-7 (rocket family)|R-7 rocket family]], which launched the first Sputnik at the beginning of the Space Race, is still in use today. It services the [[International Space Station]] (ISS) as the launcher for both the [[Soyuz (spacecraft)|Soyuz]] and [[Progress (spacecraft)|Progress]] spacecraft. It also ferries both Russian and American crews to and from the station.{{citation_needed|date=July 2019}}

Currently, the US [[Commercial Crew Development]] and [[Artemis program]] are intended to result in the development of a variety of crewed spacecraft. Russia is also developing a Soyuz replacement, and China has sent crewed [[Shenzhou (spacecraft)|Shenzhou spacecraft]] to orbit.{{citation_needed|date=July 2019}}

===Political legacy===
The imagery of the Space Race has remained poignant in the popular imagination of many nations even after the fall of the Soviet Union. In August 2020 Russia announced that they were releasing a vaccine for [[COVID-19]] skipping multiple stages of clinical trials, referring to it as the "[[Gam-COVID-Vac|Sputnik vaccine]]" to capture the sense of pride still felt by Russians from their victories in the Space Race. <ref>https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/russia-unveils-coronavirus-vaccine-claiming-victory-in-global-race-before-final-testing-is-complete/2020/08/11/792f8a54-d813-11ea-a788-2ce86ce81129_story.html</ref>
