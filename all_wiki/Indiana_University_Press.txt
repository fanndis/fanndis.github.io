== History ==

IU Press began in 1950 as part of Indiana University's post-war growth under President [[Herman B Wells]]. Bernard Perry, son of Harvard philosophy professor [[Ralph Barton Perry]], served as the first director. IU Press's first book was a translation of Edouard de Montulé's ''Travels in America, 1816-1817'', published in March 1951. A total of six books were published the first year.<ref name="IUat60">{{cite web|title=IU Press turns 60|url=http://newsinfo.iu.edu/news/page/normal/13386.html|website=IU News Room|publisher=Indiana University|accessdate=20 February 2018}}</ref>

In 1952, IU Press earned full membership with the [[Association of American University Presses]]. During its first decade in operation, IU Press published more than 200 books and increased sales from zero in 1950 to $167,000 in 1959-1960. That same decade, in 1955, it published [[Rolfe Humphries]]'s translation of the ''Metamorphoses'' of Ovid, IU Press's all-time bestseller, having sold more than 500,000 copies to date.<ref name="IUat60" />

Bernard Perry retired as director in 1976 and was replaced by John Gallman who focused on the academic strengths of Indiana University. By 1980 IU Press's annual sales neared $2 million and by 1990 had reached $4.1 million. The Journals Division launched in 1987 with three journals and now carries 29 in its catalog. By the end of John Gallman's tenure as director in 2000, IU Press published 150 books annually and reached sales of close to $7 million.<ref name="IUat60" />

In 2004 IU Press launched '''Quarry Books''', an imprint dedicated to regional topics.
