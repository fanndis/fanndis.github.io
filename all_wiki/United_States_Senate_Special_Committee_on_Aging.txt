The '''United States Senate Special Committee on Aging''' was initially established in 1961 as a temporary committee; it became a permanent [[United States Senate|Senate]] committee in 1977. As a special committee, it has no legislative authority, but it studies issues related to older Americans, particularly [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] and [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]].<ref name="charter">{{cite web|title=About the Aging Committee |work=U.S. Senate Special Committee on Aging |url=http://aging.senate.gov/about.cfm |accessdate=October 14, 2005 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070131201407/http://aging.senate.gov/about.cfm |archive-date=January 31, 2007 }}</ref>

Prior to the passage of [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]], the committee was studying health care insurance coverage for elderly American citizens. The committee conducts oversight of the Medicare program, [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] and the [[Older Americans Act]]. Some of the issues that have been examined by the committee include unacceptable conditions in [[nursing home]]s, protection from [[Ageism|age discrimination]], and pricing practices for [[prescription drug]]s.<ref name="charter"/>
