'''''Everything Is Love''''' (stylized in [[all caps]]) is a collaborative [[studio album]] by American duo [[The Carters]], their surnames by marriage. It was released on June 16, 2018, by [[Parkwood Entertainment]], [[Sony Music Entertainment]], [[S. Carter Records|S.C Enterprises]], and [[Roc Nation]].

[[Beyoncé]] and [[Jay-Z]] produced the album alongside a variety of collaborators, including [[Cool & Dre]], [[Boi-1da]], and [[Pharrell Williams]]. Additional vocalists recorded for the album include Williams, [[Quavo]], [[Offset (rapper)|Offset]], and [[Ty Dolla Sign]], among others. The hip hop and R&B album explores themes of romantic love, fame, wealth, and [[black pride]].

The album was not made public until its release was announced by Beyoncé and Jay-Z while onstage at a London concert for their [[On the Run II Tour]] and later through their [[social media]] accounts. It was originally exclusive to the music distribution service [[Tidal (service)|Tidal]], before given a wider release on June 18, 2018. In its first week, ''Everything Is Love'' debuted at number two on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], recording 123,000 [[album-equivalent unit]]s, of which 70,000 were pure album sales.<ref name="US debut">{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/8462423/5-seconds-of-summer-third-no-1-album-billboard-200-chart|title=5 Seconds of Summer Earn Third No. 1 Album on Billboard 200 Chart With 'Youngblood'|last=Caulfield|first=Keith|date=June 24, 2018|work=Billboard|access-date=June 25, 2018}}</ref> At the [[61st Annual Grammy Awards]], the album won for [[Grammy Award for Best Urban Contemporary Album|Best Urban Contemporary Album]], and was nominated [[Grammy Award for Best Music Video|Best Music Video]] for "[[Apeshit]]" and [[Grammy Award for Best R&B Performance|Best R&B Performance]] for "Summer".

Plans about a joint album by the couple were announced by Jay-Z during an interview with ''[[The New York Times]]'' in 2017 when he said that they used "art almost like a therapy session" to create new music. However, since they also worked on their respective albums ''[[4:44 (album)|4:44]]'' and ''[[Lemonade (Beyoncé album)|Lemonade]]'', and Beyoncé's music progressed more rapidly, the project was temporarily stopped. Rumors about the collaborative project began emerging in March 2018 when the couple announced their [[On the Run II Tour]].<ref name="Pitchfork">{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/news/beyonce-and-jay-z-release-new-album-everything-is-love/|title=Beyoncé and JAY-Z Release New Album Everything Is Love: Listen|work=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]|last1=Sodomsky|first1=Sam|last2=Wicks|first2=Amanda|date=June 16, 2018|access-date=June 16, 2018}}</ref>

The majority of the album was recorded at [[U Arena]] in [[Paris]]; "Friends", "Black Effect" and "Salud!" were recorded at Kingslanding Studios West in [[Los Angeles]], while further recording for "Summer" and "Nice" was done at [[The Church Studios]] in [[London]]. Beyoncé and Jay-Z co-produced all of the songs on the album themselves, with further producers including [[Pharrell]], [[Cool & Dre]], [[Boi-1da]], Jahaan Sweet, [[Dave Sitek|David Andrew Sitek]], [[D'Mile]], [[El Michels Affair|El Michels]], [[Fred Ball (producer)|Fred Ball]], [[Illmind]], [[MeLo-X]], [[Mike Dean (record producer)|Mike Dean]] and [[Nav (rapper)|Nav]]. The album was predominantly recorded by Stuart White and [[Young Guru|Gimel "Young Guru" Keaton]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=The Carters - EVERYTHING IS LOVE Album Credits|url=https://istandardproducers.com/everything-is-love-album-credits/|date=2018-06-17|website=[istandard]|language=en-US|access-date=2020-05-19}}</ref>

{{quote box
| quote = "Like the fifth act of a hip-hop and R&B [[Shakespearean comedy]], ''Everything Is Love'' finds our lovers reunited, their misunderstandings resolved, their vows renewed (Beyoncé: 'you fucked up the first stone/ we had to get remarried'), and their family looking ahead to decades of more peaceful prosperity. Outrageous, multiple-mansioned, diamonds-and-watches-and-Lambos prosperity, symbolically tied to an agenda of black capitalism as racial uplift and reparations."

''Everything is Love'' was met with generally positive reviews. At [[Metacritic]], which assigns a [[standard score|normalized]] rating out of 100 to reviews from professional critics, the album received an [[weighted mean|average]] score of 80, based on 22 reviews.<ref name="Metacritic"/> 

Reviewing the album for ''[[The New York Times]]'', Joe Coscarelli said it "completes the Knowles-Carter conceptual trilogy"—referring to the previous releases of ''[[Lemonade (Beyoncé album)|Lemonade]]'' and ''[[4:44 (album)|4:44]]''—"in an expert, tactical showing of family brand management".<ref name="NYT"/> Music critic Nicholas Hautman of ''[[Us Weekly]]'' wrote: "It's clear from the very first listen that Beyoncé outshines her husband on much of the record, which really should have been marketed as 'Beyoncé featuring Jay-Z' rather than 'Beyoncé ''and'' Jay-Z' (or 'the Carters,' in this case). His verses are few and far between in comparison to hers, but it still somehow feels like a balanced body of work from two of the greatest artists of our time."<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/beyonce-and-jay-z-everything-is-love-album-review/|title=Beyonce and Jay-Z 'Everything is Love' Album Review|work=[[Us Weekly]]|date=June 17, 2018|access-date=June 17, 2018}}</ref> In ''[[The Guardian]]'', Petridis believed the album retreads braggadocio centering around the duo's wealth and excellence, with less musical daring, but still does so with likeable music, genuine wit, and energy.<ref name="Petridis">{{cite news|last=Petridis|first=Alexis|author-link=Alexis Petridis|date=June 17, 2018|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jun/17/the-carters-everything-is-love-review-beyonce-jay-z|title= The Carters: Everything is Love review – Beyoncé and Jay-Z celebrate their marriage and magnificence|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=June 17, 2018}}</ref> As per ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' music critic [[Neil McCormick]] pointed, "''Everything Is Love'' certainly doesn’t have the musical expansiveness of ''Lemonade''.
